WEBVTT

01:28.318 --> 01:31.500
We close the door, I think it would be good.

01:50.618 --> 01:54.117
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

01:54.263 --> 02:00.888
and were trying to develop your depth.

02:01.201 --> 02:07.783
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

02:07.910 --> 02:09.441
But we have to touch that,

02:09.513 --> 02:11.931
that's very important,

02:12.176 --> 02:16.759
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

02:17.018 --> 02:20.351
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

02:20.672 --> 02:22.173
and that's a nice thing.

02:22.415 --> 02:26.248
But we have to enjoy our own company also

02:26.451 --> 02:30.617
by meditating, going within yourself.

02:30.992 --> 02:34.783
Now, "What is the use?"

02:34.870 --> 02:37.371
one may ask. "Mother, now we have got realization,

02:37.438 --> 02:40.835
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

02:40.997 --> 02:43.830
we are doing so well."

02:44.064 --> 02:49.410
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

02:49.546 --> 02:53.212
of all the things, like all the elements.

02:53.477 --> 02:55.934
When you had finished your meditation

02:56.117 --> 02:58.201
you saw how the rain fell down,

02:58.403 --> 03:00.403
how the rain came suddenly.

03:00.597 --> 03:03.347
So rain has felt your depth,

03:03.645 --> 03:06.061
or you have felt the depth of rain.

03:06.259 --> 03:09.176
Now you know that if you light one little candle

03:09.451 --> 03:13.034
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

03:13.153 --> 03:15.986
it acts, it reacts

03:16.201 --> 03:18.783
and it gives you a flame which burns,

03:18.950 --> 03:23.867
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

03:24.117 --> 03:29.618
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

03:29.784 --> 03:34.367
So all elements have got an effect,

03:34.618 --> 03:40.034
if a saint wants to have an effect.

03:40.242 --> 03:44.117
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

03:44.367 --> 03:46.409
Once you reach your own essences,

03:46.618 --> 03:53.034
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

03:53.201 --> 03:57.034
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

03:57.284 --> 03:59.284
or you can order them as you like.

03:59.451 --> 04:01.367
First they will act,

04:01.618 --> 04:03.867
expressing that they have been touched

04:04.117 --> 04:07.618
like today, the rain came pouring down.

04:07.783 --> 04:11.284
Then later on you can command,

04:11.493 --> 04:14.451
and you can ask the rain to come.

04:14.701 --> 04:18.534
To work out many things of that kind

04:18.783 --> 04:20.618
we have to be deep people,

04:20.784 --> 04:25.117
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

04:25.367 --> 04:26.618
That is, you know very well

04:26.784 --> 04:30.534
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

04:30.783 --> 04:32.950
and when we go deep into ourselves,

04:33.201 --> 04:39.034
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

04:39.284 --> 04:44.201
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.783
When we start moving horizontally,

04:46.950 --> 04:52.367
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

04:52.618 --> 04:57.701
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

04:57.867 --> 05:01.451
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

05:01.659 --> 05:06.409
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

05:06.618 --> 05:13.618
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

05:13.784 --> 05:16.117
and then everybody can hear it.

05:16.367 --> 05:22.783
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

05:22.950 --> 05:27.284
you find that you have communicated with another person.

05:27.493 --> 05:33.783
But that's only the essence of the ether

05:33.950 --> 05:37.075
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

05:37.284 --> 05:40.034
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

05:40.284 --> 05:42.367
we can say, by science,

05:42.534 --> 05:46.117
but you go to the subtlest side, and that subtlest side

05:46.284 --> 05:48.784
gives you all these effects.

05:49.034 --> 05:52.534
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

05:52.701 --> 05:55.784
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

05:56.034 --> 05:58.783
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

05:58.950 --> 06:01.701
somebody's with the head the light is coming

06:01.867 --> 06:03.201
you have seen all this.

06:03.451 --> 06:07.034
This is done also by the same method,

06:07.284 --> 06:11.534
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

06:11.701 --> 06:13.867
She's very active, She works it out,

06:14.117 --> 06:15.701
She does all these things.

06:15.867 --> 06:19.201
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

06:19.451 --> 06:23.367
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

06:23.576 --> 06:29.701
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

06:29.867 --> 06:33.701
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

06:33.867 --> 06:37.783
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

06:37.950 --> 06:39.963
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

06:40.225 --> 06:44.015
So all the, all the

06:48.293 --> 06:51.764
all the essences are

06:52.141 --> 06:57.242
working out for you. As well as
all the deities areare working out for you.

06:57.451 --> 07:01.284
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

07:01.451 --> 07:05.367
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

07:05.576 --> 07:08.284
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

07:08.534 --> 07:10.618
if you don't keep yourself all right.

07:10.783 --> 07:14.659
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

07:14.825 --> 07:17.701
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

07:17.867 --> 07:19.618
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

07:19.783 --> 07:22.159
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

07:22.367 --> 07:24.618
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

07:24.784 --> 07:28.618
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

07:28.784 --> 07:31.534
also the problem of the city where I am,

07:31.701 --> 07:33.743
also the problem of the country where I am,

07:33.909 --> 07:36.117
maybe of the whole universe.

07:36.367 --> 07:41.367
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

07:41.618 --> 07:43.451
and I do it quietly.

07:43.618 --> 07:45.367
But you must also understand

07:45.534 --> 07:48.784
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

07:49.034 --> 07:51.201
By horizontal movement what happens

07:51.451 --> 07:55.034
that you start meditating on a particular subject

07:55.284 --> 07:57.534
which is a very bothersome subject,

07:57.783 --> 08:01.242
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

08:01.451 --> 08:06.534
Anything -- you just put your attention to it and meditate.

08:06.743 --> 08:08.326
If you are that deep,

08:08.534 --> 08:11.534
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

08:11.701 --> 08:14.909
you will immediately put an effect on that.

08:15.117 --> 08:18.117
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

08:18.367 --> 08:21.284
there will be something happening in that direction.

08:21.534 --> 08:24.701
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

08:24.867 --> 08:26.534
So we have to meditate,

08:26.743 --> 08:30.950
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

08:31.117 --> 08:36.493
so automatically we start solving the problem.

08:36.701 --> 08:39.950
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

08:40.159 --> 08:46.034
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

08:46.201 --> 08:49.784
to help so many things which are to be helped.

08:50.034 --> 08:52.201
Now you see that people are realizing

08:52.367 --> 08:55.659
that the world is in a great mess,

08:55.825 --> 08:57.867
and there are lots of problems that have come

08:58.117 --> 09:00.867
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

09:01.034 --> 09:04.867
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

09:05.034 --> 09:07.117
We have no time for all this.

09:07.284 --> 09:11.117
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

09:11.284 --> 09:17.117
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

09:17.367 --> 09:21.783
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

09:21.950 --> 09:26.367
is for the inner improvement as far
as the personal side is concerned

09:26.534 --> 09:29.867
means your intelligence must improve,

09:30.034 --> 09:32.451
your temperament must improve,

09:32.701 --> 09:34.618
your heart must clear out,

09:34.784 --> 09:37.534
your feelings must be all right.

09:37.743 --> 09:41.367
Then you should, your health should be all right,

09:41.618 --> 09:44.534
then your relationship with others should be all right,

09:44.743 --> 09:46.284
your ego should go away,

09:46.534 --> 09:48.201
your superego should go away

09:48.367 --> 09:50.618
all these things are there.

09:50.784 --> 09:52.784
But this only helps a personality,

09:53.034 --> 09:56.784
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

09:57.034 --> 10:00.242
But now this personality can become an instrument,

10:00.451 --> 10:03.367
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

10:03.618 --> 10:06.117
But normally what happens, people are

10:06.284 --> 10:09.117
very much still worried about themselves,

10:09.284 --> 10:11.618
say about their wives, about their children,

10:11.783 --> 10:17.867
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

10:18.034 --> 10:22.451
These are not important things, because we have to be those

10:22.701 --> 10:26.783
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

10:26.950 --> 10:29.534
we have to develop that depth within us.

10:29.701 --> 10:31.284
That depth is possible,

10:31.534 --> 10:35.784
and you can really cure many problems of your country

10:36.034 --> 10:38.825
if you could just meditate on them.

10:39.034 --> 10:43.618
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

10:43.784 --> 10:47.034
which I had felt were there in Canberra

10:47.284 --> 10:53.534
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

10:53.825 --> 10:58.825
All these problems came into My understanding,

10:59.034 --> 11:02.326
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

11:02.534 --> 11:06.701
My working style is different because I have very sharp

11:06.867 --> 11:09.284
and very effective instruments.

11:09.451 --> 11:12.367
But I have to pay attention to it

11:12.618 --> 11:15.117
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

11:15.284 --> 11:19.201
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

11:19.451 --> 11:21.783
those deeper feelings within you,

11:21.950 --> 11:23.743
deeper sense within you.

11:23.909 --> 11:27.034
But mostly people are very superficial type.

11:27.201 --> 11:29.367
They just think about their body,

11:29.534 --> 11:33.367
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

11:33.618 --> 11:37.701
At the most they'll think we have to be very legal-minded,

11:37.867 --> 11:43.867
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

11:44.117 --> 11:49.367
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

11:49.618 --> 11:52.534
But I think that is not so.

11:52.701 --> 11:56.783
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

11:56.950 --> 12:00.117
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

12:00.367 --> 12:01.701
It's not true also,

12:01.867 --> 12:06.201
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

12:06.409 --> 12:08.701
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

12:08.867 --> 12:10.783
but the deeper you go into that love,

12:10.950 --> 12:16.534
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

12:16.701 --> 12:20.367
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

12:20.618 --> 12:23.367
Gradually that quality improves.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.950
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

12:27.117 --> 12:30.618
that house must become auspicious.

12:30.784 --> 12:33.618
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

12:33.784 --> 12:38.534
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

12:38.783 --> 12:45.451
anger, passion, lust, greed,

12:45.701 --> 12:47.367
then such a heart won't affect.

12:47.618 --> 12:49.701
But a person who has purified himself,

12:49.867 --> 12:54.784
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

12:55.034 --> 12:58.701
the whole change will take place.

12:58.867 --> 13:01.783
The circumstances will change.

13:01.950 --> 13:05.117
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

13:05.284 --> 13:07.075
Like they said, "Mother, as soon as You

13:07.284 --> 13:10.117
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

13:10.326 --> 13:13.159
as far as the television is concerned

13:13.367 --> 13:15.783
and radio is concerned."

13:15.950 --> 13:19.867
I didn't do anything -- in a way.

13:20.075 --> 13:22.284
But that should happen with you also.

13:22.451 --> 13:27.367
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

13:27.534 --> 13:29.451
But you have to be a saint,

13:29.659 --> 13:35.576
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

13:35.783 --> 13:39.576
of another person,

13:39.783 --> 13:43.618
and this is what it is lacking:

13:43.783 --> 13:47.825
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

13:48.034 --> 13:53.783
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

13:53.950 --> 13:58.284
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

13:58.534 --> 14:02.201
but it should deepen much more.

14:02.451 --> 14:07.534
You should go further and further.

14:08.242 --> 14:11.659
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

14:11.825 --> 14:14.867
It's the other way round also.

14:15.117 --> 14:20.201
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

14:20.367 --> 14:23.992
We all must meditate, that is very important

14:24.201 --> 14:26.825
meditate sincerely.

14:27.034 --> 14:30.618
Not just because we have to meditate

14:30.784 --> 14:36.909
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

14:37.117 --> 14:46.159
to express our great powers of divine love;

14:46.367 --> 14:51.034
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

14:51.201 --> 14:55.159
I know you all can do it.

14:55.367 --> 14:58.618
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

14:58.783 --> 15:02.409
big education for that, nothing is needed.

15:02.618 --> 15:06.701
What is needed is a deep feeling

15:06.867 --> 15:12.950
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

15:13.117 --> 15:16.618
The all-destructive forces change their course,

15:16.784 --> 15:21.034
and it is then for the constructive forces.

15:21.284 --> 15:29.034
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

15:29.201 --> 15:35.034
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

15:35.284 --> 15:38.367
with understanding. All right?

15:38.576 --> 15:41.867
May God bless you.

15:47.270 --> 15:50.395
It is much more than our music,

15:50.605 --> 15:55.563
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

15:55.809 --> 15:57.809
And now the course has to change.

15:57.985 --> 16:01.901
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

16:02.167 --> 16:05.751
So may God bless you for that.

16:09.051 --> 16:11.389
Have you got any questions?

16:33.521 --> 16:38.333
Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts

16:38.521 --> 16:45.261
of the body that are represented here, and here, and there.
Could You tell us please, Shri Mataji?

16:48.610 --> 16:49.975
I see.

16:53.065 --> 16:56.136
These chakras are represented outside also

16:56.311 --> 16:59.160
in our body, we can say,

16:59.298 --> 17:03.228
that on our feet as you know:

17:08.455 --> 17:10.809
you know the Nabhi,

17:10.921 --> 17:14.436
Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I’ll tell you; you’ll know)

17:14.693 --> 17:16.574
– Nabhi is the thumb,

17:18.368 --> 17:21.074
and left and right Nabhi.

17:21.469 --> 17:27.404
Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi,

17:29.198 --> 17:41.451
the third finger is the Swadhishthana,

17:43.300 --> 17:46.829
the fourth finger is the Agya,

17:47.141 --> 17:50.604
and the fifth finger is the Heart.

17:52.229 --> 17:56.483
Now this is the – our basis.

17:56.920 --> 17:59.767
Then in the hands they change,

18:00.172 --> 18:05.283
as you know. In the hands you know very well,
I need not tell about the hands.

18:05.839 --> 18:09.402
Now in your hand,

18:10.044 --> 18:15.400
we can say, this one here is the Lalita Chakra,

18:15.610 --> 18:18.697
also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

18:18.954 --> 18:22.132
It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra, Lalita Chakra.

18:22.608 --> 18:26.729
And then this is the Nabhi

18:27.492 --> 18:31.294
and this is the Vishuddhi

18:34.660 --> 18:39.666
Swadhishthana is in between, you can say.

18:40.856 --> 18:44.404
Now, Heart is here

18:44.785 --> 18:51.407
so any time you have this finger paining too much,

18:51.550 --> 18:54.526
then you must know there’s some trouble with the Heart.

18:54.649 --> 18:57.442
But Heart is not in all these things,

18:57.625 --> 19:02.587
but sometimes, sometimes it could be felt here

19:02.715 --> 19:07.738
Heart Chakra can be felt here with
a reflection maybe, on this side.

19:08.283 --> 19:11.028
So we can do like this, is to say:

19:11.339 --> 19:16.451
Vishuddhi, Heart, then Nabhi, then Swadhishthana,

19:16.664 --> 19:19.887
and then … sorry!

19:20.427 --> 19:24.892
This is the Vishuddhi

19:28.350 --> 19:30.835
this is Swadhishthana

19:31.075 --> 19:34.305
this is Heart

19:34.584 --> 19:37.937
and this is Nabhi

19:38.493 --> 19:41.214
and this one is

19:47.564 --> 19:51.950
but I never use them, so I just don’t know!

19:55.102 --> 20:00.959
Heart and this is Vishuddhi. All right?

20:02.305 --> 20:04.876
But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here

20:05.024 --> 20:09.024
because if Swadhishthana is very active your Heart goes out,

20:09.104 --> 20:10.611
so you can feel it here.

20:10.763 --> 20:17.790
It’s a very important thing that
we should have that discrimination,

20:18.005 --> 20:21.485
because if I tell you something maybe you are

20:21.564 --> 20:25.699
not yet that level of discretion, and you may get confused.

20:27.676 --> 20:30.452
So this is the Vishuddhi

20:31.430 --> 20:36.457
Now there is pain here, that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi.

20:36.906 --> 20:43.059
Now sometimes you have a problem, say, on your Vishuddhi

20:43.343 --> 20:48.419
– now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely,

20:48.991 --> 20:53.724
and you’ll be surprised, the vibrations
coming out of left Vishuddhi.

20:55.112 --> 20:59.127
Any one, you have any problem, you can pull them.

20:59.575 --> 21:04.449
And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

21:08.252 --> 21:13.066
In the same way downward if you move, this is the Nabhi

21:13.308 --> 21:16.395
this is the Swadhishthana, both are Swadhishthana

21:16.753 --> 21:24.017
and this is the Heart and

21:30.100 --> 21:34.608
this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

21:36.321 --> 21:39.563
This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

21:39.910 --> 21:42.822
So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis, because

21:42.950 --> 21:45.894
Vishuddhi, Nabhi and Swadhishthan:

21:46.538 --> 21:48.197
these three are important,

21:48.200 --> 21:52.623
because they go off immediately as soon as
– supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you,

21:52.742 --> 21:55.452
you’ll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi

21:55.688 --> 21:59.229
But these sometimes manifest, not all the time,

21:59.416 --> 22:01.471
so they can be confusing.

22:01.558 --> 22:03.557
But Swadhishthana specially.

22:03.765 --> 22:08.441
Like, when I got down in Canberra I just couldn’t walk,
both the Swadhishthanas went like that, you see.

22:08.576 --> 22:10.179
I didn’t know how to move.

22:10.283 --> 22:12.917
It was terrible because both the Swadhishthanas were caught up

22:13.029 --> 22:14.838
– for a while, but they were.

22:14.965 --> 22:18.729
So it is indicative of those things.

22:24.381 --> 22:28.015
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You please
tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

22:28.238 --> 22:29.706
Hamsa Chakra?

22:30.845 --> 22:34.226
Hamsa Chakra is placed here

22:34.599 --> 22:37.226
where some of the nerves

22:37.584 --> 22:40.927
which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over,

22:41.203 --> 22:48.119
and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra.

22:49.724 --> 22:54.205
Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agya:

22:54.375 --> 22:58.939
as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that

22:59.082 --> 23:02.987
Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ,

23:03.448 --> 23:07.823
so the connection between the two is maintained here.

23:08.744 --> 23:11.799
And this is very important, Hamsa Chakra is,

23:11.924 --> 23:17.417
that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right,
your discretion is very poor.

23:18.612 --> 23:22.943
This chakra will get easily dried out.

23:23.504 --> 23:26.757
Like if you eat very dried food, you see.

23:26.940 --> 23:34.919
Say, sometimes you also offer Me some dried food,
and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food.

23:35.119 --> 23:41.787
You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing,
because if you eat very dry food

23:41.904 --> 23:44.014
also this becomes very dry.

23:44.671 --> 23:46.659
And it’s very important

23:46.806 --> 23:50.244
because if this portion becomes dry,

23:50.357 --> 23:55.119
you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right.

23:55.469 --> 24:01.714
But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining.

24:02.611 --> 24:05.212
If the peritoneum gets dried up,

24:05.249 --> 24:07.121
the whole body gets dried up.

24:07.249 --> 24:10.447
It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up

24:10.614 --> 24:12.776
it can cause you lung cancer.

24:12.935 --> 24:17.387
As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state.

24:17.864 --> 24:21.669
So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry,

24:21.784 --> 24:25.820
all the time dry food and dry things.

24:25.979 --> 24:30.999
Moreover, not to put anything to make this a lubricant

24:32.304 --> 24:37.143
– some sort of a lubricant should be
there so there’s no problem on this chakra.

24:37.544 --> 24:40.818
Because first of all it loses your discretion,

24:41.136 --> 24:44.781
you don’t understand things,
you don’t know what to do. You mean it,

24:44.893 --> 24:50.877
you mean good, but you don’t do.
When you achieve something, it’s something not so good.

24:51.065 --> 24:53.223
The reason is, your discretion is poor.

24:53.375 --> 24:56.831
For that this must not be made dry.

25:02.736 --> 25:04.989
I have told many a times to put some

25:05.164 --> 25:09.259
ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee,

25:10.178 --> 25:13.354
keep it with you with a little dropper.

25:13.569 --> 25:15.390
You can put it in the hot water,

25:15.545 --> 25:21.626
you can heat it up every day, and take two drops in the nose

25:21.824 --> 25:26.698
in the night and in the morning time.
It doesn’t take much, but it should be done.

25:27.834 --> 25:30.650
It’s for your good.

25:33.493 --> 25:36.467
That’s the only ritual I think we follow, do we

25:36.564 --> 25:38.426
– have we any other ritual?

25:38.541 --> 25:43.138
We don’t even make a cross!

25:48.005 --> 25:50.302
Anything else?

25:51.546 --> 25:59.048
Yogi: Shri Mother, last two years ago when You were here
at Burwood, You were saying how we’ve gone beyond nirvichara

25:59.183 --> 26:07.570
and we’re into savikalpa, and we’re reaching nirvikalpa.
Could You please tell us a little about savikalpa?

26:12.662 --> 26:17.121
First stage is nirvikalpa where you become thoughtless in between,

26:17.297 --> 26:19.884
then you become, again come to thought,

26:20.061 --> 26:21.568
again you become thoughtless.

26:21.672 --> 26:24.790
That’s a very good stage where you start,

26:25.053 --> 26:29.953
and you start growing up into that.

26:30.311 --> 26:33.809
Now savikalp can be before or after this stage,

26:33.944 --> 26:37.584
like savikalpa is – “vikalpa” means doubt,

26:37.818 --> 26:40.046
and “savikalpa” means with doubt.

26:40.190 --> 26:42.943
So you are still growing with the doubts in your mind.

26:43.104 --> 26:45.983
There are people who still grow with doubts in their mind.

26:46.192 --> 26:50.029
For example you see, somebody feels hurt in Sahaja Yoga,

26:50.236 --> 26:52.195
some way he’s hurt

26:53.592 --> 26:58.231
that “I’ve been hurt in Sahaja Yoga”
– something, the subconscious is there.

26:58.621 --> 27:01.678
Then he still has that feeling within himself, “I’m hurt,

27:01.824 --> 27:05.300
but still I must do Sahaja Yoga, it is good.” Mentally he accepts

27:05.419 --> 27:10.712
and goes on with it, so he can get into nirvikalp state with that.

27:10.821 --> 27:13.233
Or maybe he gets to nirvikalpa state

27:13.337 --> 27:17.540
and then again goes to savikalpa. That’s a flashback.

27:18.104 --> 27:22.424
And could be he can say, “All right, I’ll do it in nirvichara,

27:22.528 --> 27:26.676
but from nirvichara I can go to,

27:26.811 --> 27:32.863
you see, my doubts also. After all I have my doubts,
what things and this and that is possible.”

27:32.975 --> 27:36.261
And some people have a hidden anger within themselves,

27:36.381 --> 27:41.010
or kind of a hidden feelings or hidden things

27:41.106 --> 27:46.897
which he’s not very aware of, too,
so he has also got the vikalpas with him.

27:46.993 --> 27:49.738
So with savikalpa samadhi is that,

27:49.904 --> 27:54.361
so it can be after or before nirvichara samadhi.

27:54.457 --> 27:58.058
So I mean, you go, fall on to it sometime.

27:58.541 --> 28:01.493
So we’ll have to go beyond actually savikalpa,

28:02.217 --> 28:04.967
because nirvichar samadhi is not sufficient enough.

28:05.134 --> 28:08.181
All the vikalpas, all the doubts must go away,

28:08.372 --> 28:11.152
then you’ll reach the state of nirvikalpa.

28:11.303 --> 28:14.103
Then there’s no doubt, there’s no problem.

28:14.390 --> 28:17.534
There are many among you who are like that,

28:17.938 --> 28:20.414
who are not yet aware that they are like that.

28:20.558 --> 28:26.238
That’s why I’m requesting you to develop
this new dimension in your creative work.

28:35.570 --> 28:42.520
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we sustain
a deep meditation throughout the day?

28:42.544 --> 28:52.770
I just say, when we reach an hight in meditation,
howe can we sustain it during the whole day.

28:53.027 --> 28:54.657
How can we say?

28:55.109 --> 29:01.995
Other Yogi: How can we sustain that meditation trought out
of the day. Sustaining the meditation that we had in the morning.

29:03.712 --> 29:07.006
You see, you are in meditation in a way.

29:07.340 --> 29:10.752
You are halfway in meditation and halfway not.

29:10.997 --> 29:15.044
Now if you try to develop a state of witness,

29:15.520 --> 29:17.666
then you are in meditation

29:17.913 --> 29:21.103
– just a state of witness. Whatever you see, just watch it.

29:21.327 --> 29:22.937
Just watching is the best way,

29:23.062 --> 29:28.801
and then you’ll be surprised that you will find that
you are in another world, these people are only in another world.

29:28.918 --> 29:30.562
You are seeing them from another world.

29:30.705 --> 29:32.736
Then you will have compassion for them,

29:32.912 --> 29:34.888
you will have pity for them,

29:35.015 --> 29:37.684
you may also not like them –

29:37.871 --> 29:43.093
it’s all these feelings will come up to you,
but you’ll be a person who is separated from them.

29:54.033 --> 29:56.472
[Yogi: Sometimes...

29:56.980 --> 30:01.723
you can feel that you in yourself,
in your center you are all right,

30:01.984 --> 30:08.452
but you move in circumstances
that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.]

30:10.187 --> 30:12.345
That is the savikalpa state.

30:12.689 --> 30:14.522
That is you move, you see,

30:14.685 --> 30:17.270
though you are in that state of

30:18.692 --> 30:22.136
nirvichara, still you move to savikalpa state

30:22.258 --> 30:26.370
where you again get vikalpa. But you are, you are after all

30:26.472 --> 30:29.440
a realized soul, you see. So they have made three

30:29.590 --> 30:33.162
clear-cut things, that you can have savikalpa samadhi,

30:33.670 --> 30:37.217
you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have

30:37.297 --> 30:38.910
pure nirvikalpa samadhi.

30:39.624 --> 30:42.176
Now from even that state, you see,

30:42.250 --> 30:44.711
you can get to that,

30:44.860 --> 30:46.873
and that’s what you have to cut out –

30:47.087 --> 30:49.992
is to, when you see such a situation

30:50.224 --> 30:55.173
where you get involved, then you say, “This is not, this is not,”

30:55.606 --> 30:56.899
and come out of it.

30:57.283 --> 31:00.124
It’s a practice, a little practice can tell you.

31:00.529 --> 31:04.350
Like driving, by practice you master it in the same way.

31:07.430 --> 31:11.112
When I know something is wrong, I know it is wrong

31:11.156 --> 31:14.691
and I know that they are doing wrong, but I just keep quiet

31:14.721 --> 31:18.521
and then they know what it was wrong and what was right.

31:29.293 --> 31:34.624
It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them.

31:34.948 --> 31:37.115
No one likes to be told.

31:37.428 --> 31:43.132
Then they learn themselves by mistakes,
“Yes, I’ve done this mistake, that mistakes. I’ve ruined my life.

31:43.197 --> 31:44.197
Now come along."

31:44.737 --> 31:51.389
But if you tell them, they can be very
reluctant or could be vindictive also.

32:06.620 --> 32:10.914
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You tell us
some more about the conscious mind?]

32:11.034 --> 32:13.739
Shri Mataji: About? – Yogi: the conscious mind.

32:14.269 --> 32:15.872
The conscious mind?
Yogi: Yes.

32:22.127 --> 32:27.282
What do you want to know about the conscious mind?

32:27.573 --> 32:31.310
You see, conscious mind is the mind where you are awake

32:31.778 --> 32:34.067
and see things.

32:34.437 --> 32:37.357
But there is also unconscious mind behind it;

32:37.822 --> 32:41.782
and there’s a subconscious mind, and there’s supraconscious mind,

32:42.455 --> 32:44.713
and beyond the supraconscious

32:44.947 --> 32:47.817
there is also collective supraconscious,

32:48.208 --> 32:52.828
and beyond the subconscious there is collective subconscious.

32:53.013 --> 32:54.947
There’s unconscious mind.

32:55.045 --> 32:59.614
The unconscious mind is in a way, we can say is the Kundalini.

33:01.050 --> 33:07.407
Now when She enters into your
conscious mind, you become enlightened.

33:08.875 --> 33:13.029
The conscious mind is the mind that is aware

33:13.106 --> 33:18.514
of the surroundings, aware of
everyone being there, aware of all the things.

33:18.978 --> 33:22.668
But an enlightened conscious mind which is of a high level

33:22.823 --> 33:26.051
is much more conscious of things than you are.

33:26.160 --> 33:31.565
For example, I am quite conscious
of people who are catching on the Heart,

33:32.264 --> 33:35.892
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are not yet there.

33:36.099 --> 33:40.551
I’m quite conscious of the people who are perfectly there,

33:40.812 --> 33:44.495
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are nowhere near.

33:44.665 --> 33:50.697
But it’s all right for Me, because I with My
conscious mind can raise them up.

33:50.897 --> 33:53.230
So it’s a different situation with Me.

33:53.286 --> 33:58.465
But with other people could be
that your conscious mind is all the time,

33:58.744 --> 34:04.387
depending on your level of advancement,
maybe worried about small, small things.

34:04.512 --> 34:06.690
Like ...

34:07.551 --> 34:13.332
“I have to go home now and it’s getting late,
and will I get a bus or not?” Could be like that.

34:13.578 --> 34:17.905
Then there could be another conscious mind which is thinking about

34:18.032 --> 34:22.952
how far I can meditate,
how far I can go with it, all kinds of things.

34:23.209 --> 34:28.085
But there could be a conscious mind
which is enlightened, if it is enlightened, it’s just

34:29.432 --> 34:32.529
just getting all the

34:33.111 --> 34:35.540
essence of what I am saying,

34:36.016 --> 34:38.364
and developing and nourishing itself.

34:38.785 --> 34:42.266
So when you are enlightened, the conscious mind

34:42.414 --> 34:44.595
is something like a

34:45.128 --> 34:47.845
tree into which the sap is now flowing.

34:47.988 --> 34:51.429
It may be that it is just like a leaf

34:51.736 --> 34:56.446
or it may be it is like a flower, or maybe it is like a fruit.

34:57.091 --> 35:01.430
So it changes its forms once he gets realization.

35:01.722 --> 35:07.043
If a person gets realization then
the conscious mind moves on, getting more and more light.

35:07.086 --> 35:09.418
Say for example when the electricity comes

35:09.603 --> 35:13.194
you can see this room, you can see
another’s room, you can see another room,

35:13.417 --> 35:18.925
you can go round and see and again, again you will see
it all the rooms, then you become aware of all the rooms

35:19.135 --> 35:21.150
So you are conscious of all these.

35:21.293 --> 35:25.033
But in the beginning you are just
conscious of the room where you are standing.

35:25.197 --> 35:26.223
Isn’t it?

35:26.348 --> 35:28.263
So the conscious mind’s

35:28.441 --> 35:31.120
definition cannot be given after realization.

35:31.322 --> 35:37.618
A person like Me, say for example, has a
conscious mind that might envelop the whole world.

35:37.806 --> 35:40.909
Or a conscious mind of a person who is realized soul

35:41.083 --> 35:43.886
who is still not anywhere, just started,

35:44.103 --> 35:49.714
then he’s only conscious as to
where is right, where is left, where is this.

35:52.123 --> 35:56.648
So before the realization
the conscious mind sees things around.

35:56.841 --> 35:59.277
Out of that also there are categories.

35:59.382 --> 36:02.024
Some people see, say, for artists can see something,

36:02.328 --> 36:05.154
and a scientist can see something,

36:05.366 --> 36:07.985
another poet will see something,

36:08.192 --> 36:11.160
so it depends on the conscious mind how it is,

36:11.403 --> 36:13.545
has got the trend. But

36:14.142 --> 36:18.667
still it won’t see something that is subtle behind it.

36:19.063 --> 36:23.020
And that only is possible after you get your realization.

36:23.656 --> 36:24.751
All right?

36:28.836 --> 36:34.669
Yogi: Mother, sometimes ego masquerades as guru.

36:36.232 --> 36:39.797
How can we tell when that’s going on in us?

36:42.787 --> 36:46.693
You see, when ego comes up

36:47.458 --> 36:53.299
– I don’t know much about it, you see, because I haven’t got!

36:57.229 --> 37:00.278
We can say when ego comes up,

37:00.501 --> 37:04.453
then a person becomes arbitrary.
First thing is he becomes arbitrary.

37:04.883 --> 37:09.258
It start, He’ll start deciding, “I’ll have this, I’ll have that,

37:09.426 --> 37:13.313
I like this” – you see? This is the one thing.

37:13.523 --> 37:18.015
Secondly it takes out itself from the collective,

37:18.380 --> 37:22.465
becomes very arbitrary, collective removes itself from you.

37:23.025 --> 37:25.532
But the spirit is the other way round.

37:25.664 --> 37:28.970
Spirit is, it cares for the collective.

37:29.670 --> 37:32.256
It doesn’t become arbitrary at all

37:32.399 --> 37:37.240
and it never says “I like, I want.” Its “I” drops out.

37:37.643 --> 37:41.726
You see, you can easily see, very easily with your discrimination

37:41.932 --> 37:44.877
that egoistical person

37:45.099 --> 37:48.651
is not even liked by the person who has ego.

37:49.416 --> 37:55.751
If he sees himself in the mirror he says,
“Oh God, what’s this wretched nonsense? What a temperament it is!”

37:55.980 --> 37:57.908
It will not like itself.

37:58.811 --> 38:03.208
There was a lady who was a very hot-tempered woman

38:03.510 --> 38:08.122
and once she came to My puja,
and I said, “Now what is this heater you have brought before Me

38:08.215 --> 38:12.392
in India in the hot season" – one heater put before you.

38:12.628 --> 38:16.368
I said, “Oh God, please remove her, she’s like a heater.”

38:16.698 --> 38:18.503
Nobody understood it, you see,

38:18.658 --> 38:23.732
but I said, “Please remove her.”
So then they asked her, “You get down. Mother can’t bear you.”

38:24.252 --> 38:29.669
Then she was very angry,“What is this?
What’s wrong with me? What have I done?”

38:30.457 --> 38:31.997
After some time, you see,

38:32.115 --> 38:37.765
people said that “we have nothing to do.”
Then nobody would talk to her, she was left alone,

38:38.086 --> 38:43.231
and then she was also very unhappy about it because
she was left alone. She thought, “What’s this? This is insulting.

38:43.279 --> 38:45.168
Why should they leave me alone?”

38:45.744 --> 38:47.196
Then after some time

38:47.323 --> 38:51.710
she realized that “There must be something wrong with me,

38:52.057 --> 38:56.557
I must find out. There’s something
nonsensical about it, something filthy on me.

38:56.715 --> 38:58.079
I should throw it away.”

38:58.546 --> 39:04.708
Then she started working it out and seeing
herself and all that, and she became a very, very sweet person.

39:05.001 --> 39:08.101
But she dare not face Me, was quite afraid.

39:08.644 --> 39:12.604
So her daughter came to see Me one day.
I said, “How is your mother?”

39:12.652 --> 39:16.300
She said, “Mother, she’s all right.”
“You ask her to come and see Me.”

39:16.783 --> 39:19.444
So she said, “And I have never felt such joy

39:19.523 --> 39:23.869
as I felt that day when You called me.”
I said, “I knew you have improved so much.”

39:23.972 --> 39:25.903
She came. I had taken a watch for her.

39:25.997 --> 39:29.757
She said, “Mother, You have brought a watch for me?”
I said, “Yes, I have brought a watch for you.”

39:29.803 --> 39:34.515
She said, “Thank God that filth is gone, thank God! Fed up of it!”

39:34.851 --> 39:39.820
That’s how when you develop, then
that sweetness, the beauty, everything comes up.

39:40.481 --> 39:42.526
But you see the ego is,

39:42.716 --> 39:47.022
if you play upon your ego it adheres to you.

39:47.288 --> 39:51.073
You get identified with it, and you cannot get rid of it.

39:51.237 --> 39:54.341
But I have seen one case which is such a beautiful case is,

39:54.559 --> 40:00.936
and I was sitting in My room and I could feel with the
child when she came in. And I asked her, “Where is your mother?”

40:01.126 --> 40:05.888
She was herself surprised. When she told her mother.
She said, “I’ve never had such a joy!

40:06.283 --> 40:07.742
Such a joy I had

40:08.020 --> 40:12.887
that, oh, Mother has recognized me.”
I said, “I always recognized you.”

40:14.109 --> 40:16.568
So this is what it is.

40:31.604 --> 40:40.586
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus...

40:41.499 --> 40:47.273
What she said?
Yogi: You have to speek up. Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Please.

40:47.432 --> 40:52.109
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower.

40:52.418 --> 40:58.843
Yogi repeats: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower

40:59.364 --> 41:09.860
Yogini: At the moment, if the lotus flower,
starting to lose its petals and the fruit developed?

41:14.433 --> 41:18.373
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

41:18.578 --> 41:23.223
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

41:23.429 --> 41:25.754
And the fruit developing.

41:27.875 --> 41:34.043
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

41:34.433 --> 41:37.421
If you cut it horizontally you can see

41:37.541 --> 41:41.213
as if you have cut the petals,

41:41.609 --> 41:45.073
and if you cut it vertically

41:45.312 --> 41:48.100
you can see that around the

41:48.274 --> 41:52.998
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

41:53.434 --> 41:58.155
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

41:58.346 --> 42:00.838
and they all have beautiful colors.

42:00.965 --> 42:04.306
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

42:04.704 --> 42:07.227
Now the Sahastrara is open

42:07.498 --> 42:09.655
and the lotus is open,

42:09.775 --> 42:14.114
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

42:14.296 --> 42:17.684
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

42:18.028 --> 42:22.369
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

42:23.466 --> 42:26.994
yellow-covered as we say,

42:27.073 --> 42:30.530
like a gold cap

42:30.655 --> 42:34.114
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

42:34.304 --> 42:40.117
Now the fruit of the lotus

42:40.839 --> 42:43.853
is later on we see,

42:44.298 --> 42:50.605
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

42:51.264 --> 42:54.954
– a dot, it’s a little dot

42:55.251 --> 42:57.536
– and that dot has to then grow.

42:57.988 --> 43:00.416
So it’s the second stage starts

43:00.453 --> 43:03.461
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

43:12.339 --> 43:17.978
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

43:18.279 --> 43:19.823
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

43:20.133 --> 43:28.765
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

43:29.475 --> 43:32.776
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

43:33.204 --> 43:38.622
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

43:39.749 --> 43:42.048
I would suggest just now

43:42.175 --> 43:45.654
let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

43:46.328 --> 43:50.401
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

43:50.473 --> 43:53.323
in which one has to pass through later on,

43:53.702 --> 43:56.259
and you would pass gradually

43:56.511 --> 43:59.019
when you develop yourself horizontally.

43:59.193 --> 44:01.193
That’s what we have started now,

44:01.328 --> 44:06.112
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

44:06.492 --> 44:09.608
We should see how we affect

44:10.479 --> 44:12.791
the other person,

44:12.911 --> 44:15.863
how we influence the another person.

44:15.983 --> 44:20.565
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

44:20.716 --> 44:26.533
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

44:26.742 --> 44:32.090
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

44:32.214 --> 44:38.368
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

44:38.495 --> 44:42.263
But if that person standing next to you, changes

44:42.529 --> 44:45.081
the mood and temperament of another person,

44:45.324 --> 44:49.662
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

44:50.249 --> 44:52.872
So let us see how you affect the nature.

44:53.034 --> 44:54.418
Flowers

44:54.568 --> 44:58.963
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you  the other day.

44:59.467 --> 45:01.038
In the same way

45:01.110 --> 45:05.294
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

45:05.694 --> 45:09.466
on the trees, on your friends,

45:09.566 --> 45:11.921
or in the food that you make – everything

45:11.978 --> 45:13.986
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

45:14.184 --> 45:17.070
So we have to see that, how it works out.

45:17.182 --> 45:22.110
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

45:22.378 --> 45:25.320
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

45:25.447 --> 45:27.185
Like Christine, you know Christine,

45:27.275 --> 45:29.950
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

45:30.172 --> 45:34.628
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

45:37.722 --> 45:43.077
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

45:43.248 --> 45:45.064
You see, how you are kind,

45:45.157 --> 45:49.725
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

45:49.906 --> 45:53.522
but your behavior should change another person,

45:53.967 --> 45:55.898
transform another person.

45:55.959 --> 46:00.266
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.

46:21.988 --> 46:33.093
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we develop
that same heart that poets like Kabir have for You?]

46:33.429 --> 46:37.487
Shri Mataji: Same heart as what? - Yogi: Kabir, like Kabir.

46:38.589 --> 46:39.875
Why not?

46:42.061 --> 46:44.525
See the handicap of Kabir.

46:45.445 --> 46:47.445
You have no handicaps.

46:48.023 --> 46:51.937
Kabir had no Mother to tell him, no Mother to love him,

46:52.142 --> 46:55.134
look after him and tell him all these things.

46:55.879 --> 46:59.412
He had a guru, if you know Kabir’s life.

46:59.665 --> 47:07.295
Kabir wanted to become the disciple of Ramananda Swami,

47:07.643 --> 47:11.556
but he was a Muslim or low-caste or whatever it is,

47:11.945 --> 47:15.385
so he could not  reach Ramanand Swami.

47:15.526 --> 47:19.778
The disciples would not allow him to go near Ramanand Swami.

47:20.007 --> 47:28.076
So one day Kabira went and slept on the

47:29.015 --> 47:34.807
steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold

47:34.961 --> 47:37.972
waiting for Ramanand Swami to come,

47:38.163 --> 47:41.215
because he used to always pass the same way.

47:41.501 --> 47:46.101
And his feet fell on Kabira

47:46.492 --> 47:50.317
and he said, “Oh my child, what are you doing here?”

47:50.739 --> 47:56.454
So Kabira got up and he said, “Sir,
you have accepted me as your disciple today.”

47:56.454 --> 47:58.026
He said, “Yes, I have.”

47:58.101 --> 48:02.037
And then Ramanand Swami took him and he

48:02.160 --> 48:04.278
trained him into something great.

48:04.462 --> 48:07.048
You don’t have these handicaps,

48:07.448 --> 48:12.039
where Kabira never had anybody to support him or help him around.

48:12.225 --> 48:15.573
Actually single-handed he fought the whole world.

48:17.143 --> 48:21.814
Horrible people were around him; even today those who are

48:22.496 --> 48:27.928
in his place in Patna on all places where he lived

48:28.097 --> 48:32.464
– I was self surprised that he described Kundalini as “surathi”

48:32.609 --> 48:35.004
and they described tobacco as “surathi.”

48:35.146 --> 48:39.210
Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.

48:39.670 --> 48:42.602
There Kabira lived and developed that heart.

48:42.701 --> 48:46.407
You don’t have all these handicaps, at all.

48:46.736 --> 48:51.206
You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas,

48:51.371 --> 48:54.929
you have your own Mother to tell you everything,

48:55.032 --> 48:59.961
so you can develop the same heart as Kabira had.

49:03.208 --> 49:12.403
Yogi: Mother, when I meditate sometimes I can see beautiful,

49:12.800 --> 49:24.832
like a massive flower coming out of the head or a beautiful,
sort of a golden like, almost like a vase.

49:25.116 --> 49:34.923
And I’ve been asking people, and they don’t know
really the answer, and I don’t know it either.

49:35.246 --> 49:38.238
That’s the Kundalini that you see.

49:38.414 --> 49:40.430
It is like a telescope, you see

49:40.629 --> 49:48.638
like a goldenish, yellowish sort of a, like a heated, like iron...

49:48.836 --> 49:50.337
Yogi: It’s like a furnace.

49:50.543 --> 49:53.639
Yes, furnace, it’s like a furnace. That’s the Kundalini you see,

49:53.774 --> 49:57.115
and that’s a good thing to see. But when you see you are not there,

49:57.288 --> 50:02.470
so it’s better is not to see that. But what you see is that,

50:02.590 --> 50:05.658
is the Kundalini. It’s good, I mean seeing is very good,

50:05.800 --> 50:10.375
but to go beyond it. Say,
“No, I don’t want to see it. Now I want to enter into it.”

50:10.571 --> 50:16.353
Yogi: Yes. Last night for instance
I was sleeping with my little girl,

50:16.520 --> 50:24.721
and in her bed she asked me to come. And we meditated,
and it was enormous and I woke up, suddenly woke up.

50:24.966 --> 50:26.482
In your dream you saw?

50:26.668 --> 50:30.574
Yogi: I don’t know whether it was a dream or
whether I was still meditating, but ….

50:30.749 --> 50:32.598
In dream if you see is very good,

50:32.741 --> 50:37.362
but otherwise in meditation you should not see it.
In the dream if you see, is very good.

50:37.553 --> 50:42.384
It’s the Kundalini itself, it’s like a furnace,
it looks like a silent burning furnace.

50:42.514 --> 50:46.068
Yogi: Sometimes like fireworks. It’s quite beautiful.

50:46.384 --> 50:53.032
Yes. But you shouldn’t see it
anymore, all right? Try to avoid.

50:54.863 --> 50:59.474
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You just say
something about how we pure attention?

50:59.696 --> 51:03.699
Shri Mataji: Pure?
Yogi: Pure attention, how we purify the attention.

51:03.859 --> 51:08.651
How we look beyond the human form
and the differences between each other?

51:08.811 --> 51:11.251
Pure attention?

51:12.321 --> 51:18.645
You see, your attention gets spoilt
that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass,

51:18.709 --> 51:23.149
then I start thinking about this glass that
“Oh, it’s a beautiful glass so now,

51:23.340 --> 51:25.990
so it’s a very beautifully done one.

51:26.201 --> 51:30.351
Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!”

51:43.399 --> 51:50.735
Then attention moves further, “How can I manage to steal this?

51:51.781 --> 51:55.506
And what should I do, what is the best way of stealing it?”

51:55.648 --> 52:01.739
and all those things. So the attention gives,
you see, into problems and problems because I have got

52:01.921 --> 52:05.423
for this a greed, I develop a greed.

52:05.534 --> 52:09.794
How I’ve developed? Because you see, supposing

52:10.419 --> 52:15.578
I put My attention to it and then a thought
starts from there coming to Me,

52:15.681 --> 52:18.813
a reaction as such, this gives you a reaction.

52:18.972 --> 52:21.830
Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there,

52:21.902 --> 52:24.552
then you say, “Oh, I have never seen one like this!”

52:24.647 --> 52:27.555
Like that the thought starts, you see,coming from all this.

52:27.662 --> 52:30.233
And that thought comes into My mind

52:30.282 --> 52:33.842
and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that,

52:33.933 --> 52:35.837
to steal the glass. All right?

52:35.977 --> 52:40.977
Now, the pure attention would be
that I just watch this without thinking.

52:42.310 --> 52:47.016
Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of

52:47.416 --> 52:52.185
getting involved into it or getting attached to it,

52:52.341 --> 52:57.150
you should try to just watch it without thinking.

52:57.420 --> 53:00.567
Go into thoughtless awareness, then you enjoy it the most.

53:00.690 --> 53:04.480
Now say for example, these carpets are very nice.

53:04.837 --> 53:09.873
One thing would be, if they belonged to Me
I would be worried how to insure them

53:09.956 --> 53:15.121
all these people aresitting, that would be spoilt, this, hat –
all these thoughts will come into My head.

53:15.324 --> 53:19.714
Supposing these belonged to you, then I’ll think how to manage to

53:20.117 --> 53:24.192
take them with Me somehow,

53:30.307 --> 53:37.667
and how to suggest in a very clever way
something that I can manage to take them away!

53:39.271 --> 53:43.882
Now that is quite human and one can do that way,

53:43.990 --> 53:49.133
but beyond that all cleverness and cunning,

53:49.860 --> 53:51.946
best is to appreciate.

53:52.121 --> 53:55.845
How? By just looking at it without any thought.

53:56.201 --> 54:01.718
Artist has created it, he has put all
his joy into it. I’m just enjoying the joy,

54:02.155 --> 54:03.530
just looking at it.

54:03.655 --> 54:10.666
So when you start enjoying the joy
your attention will become pure, very pure.

54:11.073 --> 54:14.813
Because the enjoyment of it is, this makes you

54:14.901 --> 54:19.905
a very sort of a dedicated person about it,

54:20.108 --> 54:23.693
because you feel that what is in this world after all?

54:24.007 --> 54:29.491
It’s to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy
everything, then why should I worry

54:29.675 --> 54:38.541
about getting it to Myself or stealing it,
or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy.

54:39.886 --> 54:46.163
So the reward of it is so great
that attention starts purifying itself.

54:47.614 --> 54:52.482
[Yogi: We tend to sort of react to
things before we even know that we’ve reacted.

54:52.614 --> 54:56.880
It seems to be such a fast process
that we look and we react in seconds.]

54:57.465 --> 55:03.282
Yes, in the beginning it is,
because you are coming from that, you see, style

55:03.470 --> 55:08.675
to the other style.
But once you settle in this style, then you’ll just react

55:08.904 --> 55:11.753
in this manner that you’ll just watch.

55:12.159 --> 55:15.341
But it otherwise also works out. I’ll tell you a story.

55:15.735 --> 55:22.526
They had given Me about sixteen
beautiful crowns – of course I couldn’t wear them

55:22.709 --> 55:28.184
– for this Krishna Puja in Switzerland, and

55:28.933 --> 55:33.674
all the English were bringing them, “smuggling” them into England,

55:34.064 --> 55:36.966
and all these boxes were kept.

55:37.331 --> 55:39.355
So when they reached the custom

55:39.447 --> 55:44.523
post, the custom post asked them,
“What are all these?” They said, “All right, you can have a look."

55:44.784 --> 55:46.831
So they passed on one to them.

55:46.983 --> 55:51.058
So the first fellow looked at it and then he passed to another one,

55:51.182 --> 55:57.500
then another one given. Like that
four were passed on to them, and they were all looking at it.

55:57.751 --> 56:02.729
And then they said, “Now what do you say?”
Nothing. They closed it and gave it to them.

56:03.912 --> 56:09.660
Then they looked back – these boys,
what has happened to them where they were?

56:09.890 --> 56:13.294
They just were moving like this.

56:13.526 --> 56:18.295
And so many cars passed but these people
never looked at any cars, they were just ….

56:19.010 --> 56:22.858
So they had a bliss casualty

56:30.504 --> 56:34.282
– also this can happen, bliss casualty!

56:41.228 --> 56:46.311
So better to see things which can cause bliss casualty!

56:47.154 --> 56:52.808
And once you get into that habit,
then you don’t take to other useless things.

56:53.226 --> 56:57.805
Then you like to see only things which can give you bliss.

56:58.491 --> 57:00.594
Your attention changes.

57:04.062 --> 57:07.514
Yogi: Mother, please, what is the Aumkara?

57:07.942 --> 57:09.416
The Aumkara?

57:09.758 --> 57:11.567
Is the first sound.

57:12.480 --> 57:21.032
When the Shakti departed from Sadashiva,

57:21.476 --> 57:25.472
from the God Almighty – His Power, His Desire

57:25.731 --> 57:28.207
departed – it made the first sound:

57:28.430 --> 57:31.692
that’s the first Child, we say, of God.

57:32.405 --> 57:35.405
That’s Aumkara. A-U-M is the thing,

57:35.754 --> 57:40.804
and these are the three Powers which are represented

57:42.510 --> 57:46.152
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

57:46.554 --> 57:53.475
And also all these are combined together to form Shri Ganesh.

57:58.791 --> 58:01.648
Yogi: Mother, what is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

58:01.855 --> 58:08.003
Shri Mataji: What is the…?
Yogi: What is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

58:11.453 --> 58:15.135
This is the one, started already!

58:16.466 --> 58:20.616
My vision for Sahaja Yoga is that, that

58:21.816 --> 58:25.152
all the good people, righteous people,

58:26.212 --> 58:28.371
God-loving people

58:28.759 --> 58:34.823
will rise above all that is useless, worldly,

58:35.678 --> 58:39.912
and reside in the Heavens

58:40.124 --> 58:45.764
with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.

58:53.959 --> 58:54.959
All right?

58:55.475 --> 59:00.165
So we can have a music,
because without that you won’t feel it is complete.

59:02.495 --> 59:05.765
Let’s hear the song …

01:00:55.544 --> 01:01:00.361
Did you hear the tape from Pune children?

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:04.286
Wasn’t it fine? Very good, isn’t it?

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:08.636
You have to make copies of that and send it over.

01:01:08.902 --> 01:01:14.080
It’s very good music and very good songs …
Yogi: Queen of Sahasrara...

01:01:17.956 --> 01:01:21.813
Such small girls they are, you see, all of them.

01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:25.306
They have made and composed everything done,

01:01:25.357 --> 01:01:30.696
and sang so clearly. It’s really remarkable.
Nobody has taught them anything.
