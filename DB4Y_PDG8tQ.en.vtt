00:01:28.318 --> 00:01:31.500
We close the door, I think it would be good.

00:01:50.618 --> 00:01:54.117
I am happy that you all were meditating here,

00:01:54.263 --> 00:02:00.888
and were trying to develop your depth.

00:02:01.201 --> 00:02:07.783
You all have depth, a very deep personality within yourself.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.441
But we have to touch that,

00:02:09.513 --> 00:02:11.931
that's very important,

00:02:12.176 --> 00:02:16.759
because you see, we sing, have music, that's a very good thing;

00:02:17.018 --> 00:02:20.351
we enjoy each other's company, also is very good

00:02:20.672 --> 00:02:22.173
and that's a nice thing.

00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:26.248
But we have to enjoy our own company also

00:02:26.451 --> 00:02:30.617
by meditating, going within yourself.

00:02:30.992 --> 00:02:34.783
Now, "What is the use?"

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:37.371
one may ask. "Mother, now we have got realization,

00:02:37.438 --> 00:02:40.835
we have a nice life, we are enjoying ourselves,

00:02:40.997 --> 00:02:43.830
we are doing so well."

00:02:44.064 --> 00:02:49.410
The deeper you go, the deeper you touch the essences

00:02:49.546 --> 00:02:53.212
of all the things, like all the elements.

00:02:53.477 --> 00:02:55.934
When you had finished your meditation

00:02:56.117 --> 00:02:58.201
you saw how the rain fell down,

00:02:58.403 --> 00:03:00.403
how the rain came suddenly.

00:03:00.597 --> 00:03:03.347
So rain has felt your depth,

00:03:03.645 --> 00:03:06.061
or you have felt the depth of rain.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.176
Now you know that if you light one little candle

00:03:09.451 --> 00:03:13.034
and put your finger towards it with My photograph there,

00:03:13.153 --> 00:03:15.986
it acts, it reacts

00:03:16.201 --> 00:03:18.783
and it gives you a flame which burns,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.867
sometimes gives you smoke, sometimes it gallops.

00:03:24.117 --> 00:03:29.618
So you have noticed that there's a reaction, even in the fire.

00:03:29.784 --> 00:03:34.367
So all elements have got an effect,

00:03:34.618 --> 00:03:40.034
if a saint wants to have an effect.

00:03:40.242 --> 00:03:44.117
But first of all you must reach your own essences.

00:03:44.367 --> 00:03:46.409
Once you reach your own essences,

00:03:46.618 --> 00:03:53.034
then you reach the essences of all the elements,

00:03:53.201 --> 00:03:57.034
and then you can handle all the elements as you like

00:03:57.284 --> 00:03:59.284
or you can order them as you like.

00:03:59.451 --> 00:04:01.367
First they will act,

00:04:01.618 --> 00:04:03.867
expressing that they have been touched

00:04:04.117 --> 00:04:07.618
like today, the rain came pouring down.

00:04:07.783 --> 00:04:11.284
Then later on you can command,

00:04:11.493 --> 00:04:14.451
and you can ask the rain to come.

00:04:14.701 --> 00:04:18.534
To work out many things of that kind

00:04:18.783 --> 00:04:20.618
we have to be deep people,

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:25.117
we have to go much deeper within ourselves to touch our essences.

00:04:25.367 --> 00:04:26.618
That is, you know very well

00:04:26.784 --> 00:04:30.534
that all our chakras are made out of these essences,

00:04:30.783 --> 00:04:32.950
and when we go deep into ourselves,

00:04:33.201 --> 00:04:39.034
what we find that we can touch the elements very well.

00:04:39.284 --> 00:04:44.201
But while doing so, actually we move horizontally.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.783
When we start moving horizontally,

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.367
at the core of it we find that there are these essences placed,

00:04:52.618 --> 00:04:57.701
and these essences then start exciting the essences across.

00:04:57.867 --> 00:05:01.451
Like in the radio you have seen there's ether.

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:06.409
Now when you speak on one side of the radio,

00:05:06.618 --> 00:05:13.618
it gets completely manifested in the essence of the ether

00:05:13.784 --> 00:05:16.117
and then everybody can hear it.

00:05:16.367 --> 00:05:22.783
Now when you people just give a bandhan sometimes,

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.284
you find that you have communicated with another person.

00:05:27.493 --> 00:05:33.783
But that's only the essence of the ether

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.075
we can say, the subtler of the subtlest.

00:05:37.284 --> 00:05:40.034
People have only gone onto the subtler side,

00:05:40.284 --> 00:05:42.367
we can say, by science,

00:05:42.534 --> 00:05:46.117
but you go to the subtlest side, and that subtlest side

00:05:46.284 --> 00:05:48.784
gives you all these effects.

00:05:49.034 --> 00:05:52.534
Now you have seen also that in some of the photographs

00:05:52.701 --> 00:05:55.784
suddenly you find light coming out of My head,

00:05:56.034 --> 00:05:58.783
or there's somebody shown as with the light,

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:01.701
somebody's with the head the light is coming

00:06:01.867 --> 00:06:03.201
you have seen all this.

00:06:03.451 --> 00:06:07.034
This is done also by the same method,

00:06:07.284 --> 00:06:11.534
but here the deities like Vishnumaya works out.

00:06:11.701 --> 00:06:13.867
She's very active, She works it out,

00:06:14.117 --> 00:06:15.701
She does all these things.

00:06:15.867 --> 00:06:19.201
And you know that also that when they gave Me once

00:06:19.451 --> 00:06:23.367
a beautiful crown in Switzerland,

00:06:23.576 --> 00:06:29.701
in the sky they got the photograph of the same.

00:06:29.867 --> 00:06:33.701
Very beautifully done, the crown was there,

00:06:33.867 --> 00:06:37.783
Fatima's crown, My face, My eyes and everything so clearly.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.963
All this is done by Vishnumaya.

00:06:40.225 --> 00:06:44.015
So all the, all the

00:06:48.293 --> 00:06:51.764
all the essences are

00:06:52.141 --> 00:06:57.242
working out for you. As well as
all the deities areare working out for you.

00:06:57.451 --> 00:07:01.284
They are very anxious that these things should be done,

00:07:01.451 --> 00:07:05.367
and you are the channels for them to work it out.

00:07:05.576 --> 00:07:08.284
Now for example, as I told you the other day,

00:07:08.534 --> 00:07:10.618
if you don't keep yourself all right.

00:07:10.783 --> 00:07:14.659
A simple thing I have told you, to put in the nose some ghee.

00:07:14.825 --> 00:07:17.701
It's a very simple thing but that helps Me a lot,

00:07:17.867 --> 00:07:19.618
because that helps My Vishuddhi.

00:07:19.783 --> 00:07:22.159
But if you don't do it I suck in, in any case,

00:07:22.367 --> 00:07:24.618
whatever problems you have, I suck in.

00:07:24.784 --> 00:07:28.618
I suck in the problem of Sahaja yogis,

00:07:28.784 --> 00:07:31.534
also the problem of the city where I am,

00:07:31.701 --> 00:07:33.743
also the problem of the country where I am,

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:36.117
maybe of the whole universe.

00:07:36.367 --> 00:07:41.367
But My horizontal movement is quite large and is very subtle,

00:07:41.618 --> 00:07:43.451
and I do it quietly.

00:07:43.618 --> 00:07:45.367
But you must also understand

00:07:45.534 --> 00:07:48.784
that you can do a lot by your horizontal movement.

00:07:49.034 --> 00:07:51.201
By horizontal movement what happens

00:07:51.451 --> 00:07:55.034
that you start meditating on a particular subject

00:07:55.284 --> 00:07:57.534
which is a very bothersome subject,

00:07:57.783 --> 00:08:01.242
and which is for the destructive of humanity.

00:08:01.451 --> 00:08:06.534
Anything -- you just put your attention to it and meditate.

00:08:06.743 --> 00:08:08.326
If you are that deep,

00:08:08.534 --> 00:08:11.534
that means if your caliber has improved to that extent,

00:08:11.701 --> 00:08:14.909
you will immediately put an effect on that.

00:08:15.117 --> 00:08:18.117
Immediately you will see there will be a change,

00:08:18.367 --> 00:08:21.284
there will be something happening in that direction.

00:08:21.534 --> 00:08:24.701
This is your power which you have to actually develop.

00:08:24.867 --> 00:08:26.534
So we have to meditate,

00:08:26.743 --> 00:08:30.950
and by meditation we develop that strength within us,

00:08:31.117 --> 00:08:36.493
so automatically we start solving the problem.

00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:39.950
Like our antennae grow up to that point:

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:46.034
the way we are strong inside, they grow outside

00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:49.784
to help so many things which are to be helped.

00:08:50.034 --> 00:08:52.201
Now you see that people are realizing

00:08:52.367 --> 00:08:55.659
that the world is in a great mess,

00:08:55.825 --> 00:08:57.867
and there are lots of problems that have come

00:08:58.117 --> 00:09:00.867
through materialism, through wrong thinking,

00:09:01.034 --> 00:09:04.867
through emotional thinking, through stupidity we can say.

00:09:05.034 --> 00:09:07.117
We have no time for all this.

00:09:07.284 --> 00:09:11.117
What we have to do is to develop ourselves deeper and deeper

00:09:11.284 --> 00:09:17.117
and deeper, so that on horizontal plane also we are effective.

00:09:17.367 --> 00:09:21.783
Sahaja Yoga first of all is for personal improvement,

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:26.367
is for the inner improvement as far
as the personal side is concerned

00:09:26.534 --> 00:09:29.867
means your intelligence must improve,

00:09:30.034 --> 00:09:32.451
your temperament must improve,

00:09:32.701 --> 00:09:34.618
your heart must clear out,

00:09:34.784 --> 00:09:37.534
your feelings must be all right.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:41.367
Then you should, your health should be all right,

00:09:41.618 --> 00:09:44.534
then your relationship with others should be all right,

00:09:44.743 --> 00:09:46.284
your ego should go away,

00:09:46.534 --> 00:09:48.201
your superego should go away

00:09:48.367 --> 00:09:50.618
all these things are there.

00:09:50.784 --> 00:09:52.784
But this only helps a personality,

00:09:53.034 --> 00:09:56.784
just a personality that is very limited, that is yourself.

00:09:57.034 --> 00:10:00.242
But now this personality can become an instrument,

00:10:00.451 --> 00:10:03.367
if you can develop that depth within yourself.

00:10:03.618 --> 00:10:06.117
But normally what happens, people are

00:10:06.284 --> 00:10:09.117
very much still worried about themselves,

00:10:09.284 --> 00:10:11.618
say about their wives, about their children,

00:10:11.783 --> 00:10:17.867
about their husbands or their household, or this and that.

00:10:18.034 --> 00:10:22.451
These are not important things, because we have to be those

00:10:22.701 --> 00:10:26.783
instruments which are what you call them, like pilotless bombs,

00:10:26.950 --> 00:10:29.534
we have to develop that depth within us.

00:10:29.701 --> 00:10:31.284
That depth is possible,

00:10:31.534 --> 00:10:35.784
and you can really cure many problems of your country

00:10:36.034 --> 00:10:38.825
if you could just meditate on them.

00:10:39.034 --> 00:10:43.618
Now for today, I had actually sucked in most of the problems

00:10:43.784 --> 00:10:47.034
which I had felt were there in Canberra

00:10:47.284 --> 00:10:53.534
and later on in that conference, and later on here.

00:10:53.825 --> 00:10:58.825
All these problems came into My understanding,

00:10:59.034 --> 00:11:02.326
I would say, and I was trying to work on them.

00:11:02.534 --> 00:11:06.701
My working style is different because I have very sharp

00:11:06.867 --> 00:11:09.284
and very effective instruments.

00:11:09.451 --> 00:11:12.367
But I have to pay attention to it

00:11:12.618 --> 00:11:15.117
and I a little bit suffer also, doesn't matter.

00:11:15.284 --> 00:11:19.201
Now for you also, it is important that you also develop

00:11:19.451 --> 00:11:21.783
those deeper feelings within you,

00:11:21.950 --> 00:11:23.743
deeper sense within you.

00:11:23.909 --> 00:11:27.034
But mostly people are very superficial type.

00:11:27.201 --> 00:11:29.367
They just think about their body,

00:11:29.534 --> 00:11:33.367
their impressions, how they carry themselves.

00:11:33.618 --> 00:11:37.701
At the most they'll think we have to be very legal-minded,

00:11:37.867 --> 00:11:43.867
or we have to be at the most not drinking, not smoking,

00:11:44.117 --> 00:11:49.367
and all these things are achieved and we have achieved everything.

00:11:49.618 --> 00:11:52.534
But I think that is not so.

00:11:52.701 --> 00:11:56.783
And second point is that we think that if we love each other,

00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:00.117
if we love Mother, that is the end of everything.

00:12:00.367 --> 00:12:01.701
It's not true also,

00:12:01.867 --> 00:12:06.201
because you see, your love for Me is there no doubt

00:12:06.409 --> 00:12:08.701
and it should be intense, it should be deeper;

00:12:08.867 --> 00:12:10.783
but the deeper you go into that love,

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:16.534
then you will be surprised how you receive a special quality

00:12:16.701 --> 00:12:20.367
of correcting the things that are wrong around you.

00:12:20.618 --> 00:12:23.367
Gradually that quality improves.

00:12:23.534 --> 00:12:26.950
For example, a Sahaja yogi goes to anybody's house,

00:12:27.117 --> 00:12:30.618
that house must become auspicious.

00:12:30.784 --> 00:12:33.618
But such a Sahaja yogi must have a good heart.

00:12:33.784 --> 00:12:38.534
If the heart is not good, in the heart there is still

00:12:38.783 --> 00:12:45.451
anger, passion, lust, greed,

00:12:45.701 --> 00:12:47.367
then such a heart won't affect.

00:12:47.618 --> 00:12:49.701
But a person who has purified himself,

00:12:49.867 --> 00:12:54.784
if he goes into any family, any household, any society,

00:12:55.034 --> 00:12:58.701
the whole change will take place.

00:12:58.867 --> 00:13:01.783
The circumstances will change.

00:13:01.950 --> 00:13:05.117
Things that do not work out will start working out immediately.

00:13:05.284 --> 00:13:07.075
Like they said, "Mother, as soon as You

00:13:07.284 --> 00:13:10.117
sent from this Sunday, everything started working out

00:13:10.326 --> 00:13:13.159
as far as the television is concerned

00:13:13.367 --> 00:13:15.783
and radio is concerned."

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:19.867
I didn't do anything -- in a way.

00:13:20.075 --> 00:13:22.284
But that should happen with you also.

00:13:22.451 --> 00:13:27.367
Wherever a saint goes, things are changing.

00:13:27.534 --> 00:13:29.451
But you have to be a saint,

00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:35.576
and a saintly person has a very deep understanding

00:13:35.783 --> 00:13:39.576
of another person,

00:13:39.783 --> 00:13:43.618
and this is what it is lacking:

00:13:43.783 --> 00:13:47.825
we don't have that deep understanding for each other.

00:13:48.034 --> 00:13:53.783
Then even if you have for some of your own friends,

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:58.284
or maybe in the same ashram that you are staying and all that

00:13:58.534 --> 00:14:02.201
but it should deepen much more.

00:14:02.451 --> 00:14:07.534
You should go further and further.

00:14:08.242 --> 00:14:11.659
Now even if you think of Me, it works out.

00:14:11.825 --> 00:14:14.867
It's the other way round also.

00:14:15.117 --> 00:14:20.201
But first of all the meditative process should be increased.

00:14:20.367 --> 00:14:23.992
We all must meditate, that is very important

00:14:24.201 --> 00:14:26.825
meditate sincerely.

00:14:27.034 --> 00:14:30.618
Not just because we have to meditate

00:14:30.784 --> 00:14:36.909
but because we have to be deep, we have to grow within

00:14:37.117 --> 00:14:46.159
to express our great powers of divine love;

00:14:46.367 --> 00:14:51.034
to correct so many things, which you can do very easily

00:14:51.201 --> 00:14:55.159
I know you all can do it.

00:14:55.367 --> 00:14:58.618
There's no need to have big degrees for that,

00:14:58.783 --> 00:15:02.409
big education for that, nothing is needed.

00:15:02.618 --> 00:15:06.701
What is needed is a deep feeling

00:15:06.867 --> 00:15:12.950
of love for the whole universe, and that changes.

00:15:13.117 --> 00:15:16.618
The all-destructive forces change their course,

00:15:16.784 --> 00:15:21.034
and it is then for the constructive forces.

00:15:21.284 --> 00:15:29.034
But on the whole that works out much faster if you all

00:15:29.201 --> 00:15:35.034
do that meditation with sincerity, with intensity,

00:15:35.284 --> 00:15:38.367
with understanding. All right?

00:15:38.576 --> 00:15:41.867
May God bless you.

00:15:47.270 --> 00:15:50.395
It is much more than our music,

00:15:50.605 --> 00:15:55.563
much more than My lectures or anything, that we have to do.

00:15:55.809 --> 00:15:57.809
And now the course has to change.

00:15:57.985 --> 00:16:01.901
I am sure you people will take to the new course.

00:16:02.167 --> 00:16:05.751
So may God bless you for that.

00:16:09.051 --> 00:16:11.389
Have you got any questions?

00:16:33.521 --> 00:16:38.333
Yogi: There seems to be some difference of opinion on parts

00:16:38.521 --> 00:16:45.261
of the body that are represented here, and here, and there.
Could You tell us please, Shri Mataji?

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:49.975
I see.

00:16:53.065 --> 00:16:56.136
These chakras are represented outside also

00:16:56.311 --> 00:16:59.160
in our body, we can say,

00:16:59.298 --> 00:17:03.228
that on our feet as you know:

00:17:08.455 --> 00:17:10.809
you know the Nabhi,

00:17:10.921 --> 00:17:14.436
Nabhi is the thumb* (you be seated and I’ll tell you; you’ll know)

00:17:14.693 --> 00:17:16.574
– Nabhi is the thumb,

00:17:18.368 --> 00:17:21.074
and left and right Nabhi.

00:17:21.469 --> 00:17:27.404
Then second finger from the thumb is the Vishuddhi,

00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:41.451
the third finger is the Swadhishthana,

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:46.829
the fourth finger is the Agya,

00:17:47.141 --> 00:17:50.604
and the fifth finger is the Heart.

00:17:52.229 --> 00:17:56.483
Now this is the – our basis.

00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:59.767
Then in the hands they change,

00:18:00.172 --> 00:18:05.283
as you know. In the hands you know very well,
I need not tell about the hands.

00:18:05.839 --> 00:18:09.402
Now in your hand,

00:18:10.044 --> 00:18:15.400
we can say, this one here is the Lalita Chakra,

00:18:15.610 --> 00:18:18.697
also is the part of the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:18:18.954 --> 00:18:22.132
It works out the Vishuddhi Chakra, Lalita Chakra.

00:18:22.608 --> 00:18:26.729
And then this is the Nabhi

00:18:27.492 --> 00:18:31.294
and this is the Vishuddhi

00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:39.666
Swadhishthana is in between, you can say.

00:18:40.856 --> 00:18:44.404
Now, Heart is here

00:18:44.785 --> 00:18:51.407
so any time you have this finger paining too much,

00:18:51.550 --> 00:18:54.526
then you must know there’s some trouble with the Heart.

00:18:54.649 --> 00:18:57.442
But Heart is not in all these things,

00:18:57.625 --> 00:19:02.587
but sometimes, sometimes it could be felt here

00:19:02.715 --> 00:19:07.738
Heart Chakra can be felt here with
a reflection maybe, on this side.

00:19:08.283 --> 00:19:11.028
So we can do like this, is to say:

00:19:11.339 --> 00:19:16.451
Vishuddhi, Heart, then Nabhi, then Swadhishthana,

00:19:16.664 --> 00:19:19.887
and then … sorry!

00:19:20.427 --> 00:19:24.892
This is the Vishuddhi

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:30.835
this is Swadhishthana

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:34.305
this is Heart

00:19:34.584 --> 00:19:37.937
and this is Nabhi

00:19:38.493 --> 00:19:41.214
and this one is

00:19:47.564 --> 00:19:51.950
but I never use them, so I just don’t know!

00:19:55.102 --> 00:20:00.959
Heart and this is Vishuddhi. All right?

00:20:02.305 --> 00:20:04.876
But you can feel it sometimes even Heart here

00:20:05.024 --> 00:20:09.024
because if Swadhishthana is very active your Heart goes out,

00:20:09.104 --> 00:20:10.611
so you can feel it here.

00:20:10.763 --> 00:20:17.790
It’s a very important thing that
we should have that discrimination,

00:20:18.005 --> 00:20:21.485
because if I tell you something maybe you are

00:20:21.564 --> 00:20:25.699
not yet that level of discretion, and you may get confused.

00:20:27.676 --> 00:20:30.452
So this is the Vishuddhi

00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.457
Now there is pain here, that means there is problem with your Vishuddhi.

00:20:36.906 --> 00:20:43.059
Now sometimes you have a problem, say, on your Vishuddhi

00:20:43.343 --> 00:20:48.419
– now you can pull this finger. Just to pull the finger nicely,

00:20:48.991 --> 00:20:53.724
and you’ll be surprised, the vibrations
coming out of left Vishuddhi.

00:20:55.112 --> 00:20:59.127
Any one, you have any problem, you can pull them.

00:20:59.575 --> 00:21:04.449
And that is how all the chakras are placed in the body.

00:21:08.252 --> 00:21:13.066
In the same way downward if you move, this is the Nabhi

00:21:13.308 --> 00:21:16.395
this is the Swadhishthana, both are Swadhishthana

00:21:16.753 --> 00:21:24.017
and this is the Heart and

00:21:30.100 --> 00:21:34.608
this is the Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

00:21:36.321 --> 00:21:39.563
This is Vishuddhi at the ankle bone.

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.822
So the main thing to remember are the Vishuddhis, because

00:21:42.950 --> 00:21:45.894
Vishuddhi, Nabhi and Swadhishthan:

00:21:46.538 --> 00:21:48.197
these three are important,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.623
because they go off immediately as soon as
– supposing there is a Nabhi patient sitting with you,

00:21:52.742 --> 00:21:55.452
you’ll immediately have a problem on your Nabhi

00:21:55.688 --> 00:21:59.229
But these sometimes manifest, not all the time,

00:21:59.416 --> 00:22:01.471
so they can be confusing.

00:22:01.558 --> 00:22:03.557
But Swadhishthana specially.

00:22:03.765 --> 00:22:08.441
Like, when I got down in Canberra I just couldn’t walk,
both the Swadhishthanas went like that, you see.

00:22:08.576 --> 00:22:10.179
I didn’t know how to move.

00:22:10.283 --> 00:22:12.917
It was terrible because both the Swadhishthanas were caught up

00:22:13.029 --> 00:22:14.838
– for a while, but they were.

00:22:14.965 --> 00:22:18.729
So it is indicative of those things.

00:22:24.381 --> 00:22:28.015
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You please
tell us more about Hamsa Chakra?

00:22:28.238 --> 00:22:29.706
Hamsa Chakra?

00:22:30.845 --> 00:22:34.226
Hamsa Chakra is placed here

00:22:34.599 --> 00:22:37.226
where some of the nerves

00:22:37.584 --> 00:22:40.927
which are coming from Ida and Pingala cross over,

00:22:41.203 --> 00:22:48.119
and is a part of Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:22:49.724 --> 00:22:54.205
Plus the connection with Vishuddhi and Agya:

00:22:54.375 --> 00:22:58.939
as you must have read in the Devi Mahatmyam that

00:22:59.082 --> 00:23:02.987
Shri Krishna is the Father of Christ,

00:23:03.448 --> 00:23:07.823
so the connection between the two is maintained here.

00:23:08.744 --> 00:23:11.799
And this is very important, Hamsa Chakra is,

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:17.417
that if your Hamsa Chakra is not all right,
your discretion is very poor.

00:23:18.612 --> 00:23:22.943
This chakra will get easily dried out.

00:23:23.504 --> 00:23:26.757
Like if you eat very dried food, you see.

00:23:26.940 --> 00:23:34.919
Say, sometimes you also offer Me some dried food,
and I have to tell you that not to give too dry food.

00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:41.787
You must eat it with some sauce or some liquid thing,
because if you eat very dry food

00:23:41.904 --> 00:23:44.014
also this becomes very dry.

00:23:44.671 --> 00:23:46.659
And it’s very important

00:23:46.806 --> 00:23:50.244
because if this portion becomes dry,

00:23:50.357 --> 00:23:55.119
you can put some oil or ghee into it to make it all right.

00:23:55.469 --> 00:24:01.714
But from here starts the drying of the peritoneum and the lining.

00:24:02.611 --> 00:24:05.212
If the peritoneum gets dried up,

00:24:05.249 --> 00:24:07.121
the whole body gets dried up.

00:24:07.249 --> 00:24:10.447
It can be anywhere; in the lung if it is dried up

00:24:10.614 --> 00:24:12.776
it can cause you lung cancer.

00:24:12.935 --> 00:24:17.387
As even the peritoneum can be in a cancer state.

00:24:17.864 --> 00:24:21.669
So one has to be very careful not to take something very dry,

00:24:21.784 --> 00:24:25.820
all the time dry food and dry things.

00:24:25.979 --> 00:24:30.999
Moreover, not to put anything to make this a lubricant

00:24:32.304 --> 00:24:37.143
– some sort of a lubricant should be
there so there’s no problem on this chakra.

00:24:37.544 --> 00:24:40.818
Because first of all it loses your discretion,

00:24:41.136 --> 00:24:44.781
you don’t understand things,
you don’t know what to do. You mean it,

00:24:44.893 --> 00:24:50.877
you mean good, but you don’t do.
When you achieve something, it’s something not so good.

00:24:51.065 --> 00:24:53.223
The reason is, your discretion is poor.

00:24:53.375 --> 00:24:56.831
For that this must not be made dry.

00:25:02.736 --> 00:25:04.989
I have told many a times to put some

00:25:05.164 --> 00:25:09.259
ghee every day. Get a little bottle of ghee,

00:25:10.178 --> 00:25:13.354
keep it with you with a little dropper.

00:25:13.569 --> 00:25:15.390
You can put it in the hot water,

00:25:15.545 --> 00:25:21.626
you can heat it up every day, and take two drops in the nose

00:25:21.824 --> 00:25:26.698
in the night and in the morning time.
It doesn’t take much, but it should be done.

00:25:27.834 --> 00:25:30.650
It’s for your good.

00:25:33.493 --> 00:25:36.467
That’s the only ritual I think we follow, do we

00:25:36.564 --> 00:25:38.426
– have we any other ritual?

00:25:38.541 --> 00:25:43.138
We don’t even make a cross!

00:25:48.005 --> 00:25:50.302
Anything else?

00:25:51.546 --> 00:25:59.048
Yogi: Shri Mother, last two years ago when You were here
at Burwood, You were saying how we’ve gone beyond nirvichara

00:25:59.183 --> 00:26:07.570
and we’re into savikalpa, and we’re reaching nirvikalpa.
Could You please tell us a little about savikalpa?

00:26:12.662 --> 00:26:17.121
First stage is nirvikalpa where you become thoughtless in between,

00:26:17.297 --> 00:26:19.884
then you become, again come to thought,

00:26:20.061 --> 00:26:21.568
again you become thoughtless.

00:26:21.672 --> 00:26:24.790
That’s a very good stage where you start,

00:26:25.053 --> 00:26:29.953
and you start growing up into that.

00:26:30.311 --> 00:26:33.809
Now savikalp can be before or after this stage,

00:26:33.944 --> 00:26:37.584
like savikalpa is – “vikalpa” means doubt,

00:26:37.818 --> 00:26:40.046
and “savikalpa” means with doubt.

00:26:40.190 --> 00:26:42.943
So you are still growing with the doubts in your mind.

00:26:43.104 --> 00:26:45.983
There are people who still grow with doubts in their mind.

00:26:46.192 --> 00:26:50.029
For example you see, somebody feels hurt in Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:50.236 --> 00:26:52.195
some way he’s hurt

00:26:53.592 --> 00:26:58.231
that “I’ve been hurt in Sahaja Yoga”
– something, the subconscious is there.

00:26:58.621 --> 00:27:01.678
Then he still has that feeling within himself, “I’m hurt,

00:27:01.824 --> 00:27:05.300
but still I must do Sahaja Yoga, it is good.” Mentally he accepts

00:27:05.419 --> 00:27:10.712
and goes on with it, so he can get into nirvikalp state with that.

00:27:10.821 --> 00:27:13.233
Or maybe he gets to nirvikalpa state

00:27:13.337 --> 00:27:17.540
and then again goes to savikalpa. That’s a flashback.

00:27:18.104 --> 00:27:22.424
And could be he can say, “All right, I’ll do it in nirvichara,

00:27:22.528 --> 00:27:26.676
but from nirvichara I can go to,

00:27:26.811 --> 00:27:32.863
you see, my doubts also. After all I have my doubts,
what things and this and that is possible.”

00:27:32.975 --> 00:27:36.261
And some people have a hidden anger within themselves,

00:27:36.381 --> 00:27:41.010
or kind of a hidden feelings or hidden things

00:27:41.106 --> 00:27:46.897
which he’s not very aware of, too,
so he has also got the vikalpas with him.

00:27:46.993 --> 00:27:49.738
So with savikalpa samadhi is that,

00:27:49.904 --> 00:27:54.361
so it can be after or before nirvichara samadhi.

00:27:54.457 --> 00:27:58.058
So I mean, you go, fall on to it sometime.

00:27:58.541 --> 00:28:01.493
So we’ll have to go beyond actually savikalpa,

00:28:02.217 --> 00:28:04.967
because nirvichar samadhi is not sufficient enough.

00:28:05.134 --> 00:28:08.181
All the vikalpas, all the doubts must go away,

00:28:08.372 --> 00:28:11.152
then you’ll reach the state of nirvikalpa.

00:28:11.303 --> 00:28:14.103
Then there’s no doubt, there’s no problem.

00:28:14.390 --> 00:28:17.534
There are many among you who are like that,

00:28:17.938 --> 00:28:20.414
who are not yet aware that they are like that.

00:28:20.558 --> 00:28:26.238
That’s why I’m requesting you to develop
this new dimension in your creative work.

00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:42.520
Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we sustain
a deep meditation throughout the day?

00:28:42.544 --> 00:28:52.770
I just say, when we reach an hight in meditation,
howe can we sustain it during the whole day.

00:28:53.027 --> 00:28:54.657
How can we say?

00:28:55.109 --> 00:29:01.995
Other Yogi: How can we sustain that meditation trought out
of the day. Sustaining the meditation that we had in the morning.

00:29:03.712 --> 00:29:07.006
You see, you are in meditation in a way.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:10.752
You are halfway in meditation and halfway not.

00:29:10.997 --> 00:29:15.044
Now if you try to develop a state of witness,

00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:17.666
then you are in meditation

00:29:17.913 --> 00:29:21.103
– just a state of witness. Whatever you see, just watch it.

00:29:21.327 --> 00:29:22.937
Just watching is the best way,

00:29:23.062 --> 00:29:28.801
and then you’ll be surprised that you will find that
you are in another world, these people are only in another world.

00:29:28.918 --> 00:29:30.562
You are seeing them from another world.

00:29:30.705 --> 00:29:32.736
Then you will have compassion for them,

00:29:32.912 --> 00:29:34.888
you will have pity for them,

00:29:35.015 --> 00:29:37.684
you may also not like them –

00:29:37.871 --> 00:29:43.093
it’s all these feelings will come up to you,
but you’ll be a person who is separated from them.

00:29:54.033 --> 00:29:56.472
[Yogi: Sometimes...

00:29:56.980 --> 00:30:01.723
you can feel that you in yourself,
in your center you are all right,

00:30:01.984 --> 00:30:08.452
but you move in circumstances
that cause a disharmony in some other part of you.]

00:30:10.187 --> 00:30:12.345
That is the savikalpa state.

00:30:12.689 --> 00:30:14.522
That is you move, you see,

00:30:14.685 --> 00:30:17.270
though you are in that state of

00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:22.136
nirvichara, still you move to savikalpa state

00:30:22.258 --> 00:30:26.370
where you again get vikalpa. But you are, you are after all

00:30:26.472 --> 00:30:29.440
a realized soul, you see. So they have made three

00:30:29.590 --> 00:30:33.162
clear-cut things, that you can have savikalpa samadhi,

00:30:33.670 --> 00:30:37.217
you can have nirvichara samadhi and you can have

00:30:37.297 --> 00:30:38.910
pure nirvikalpa samadhi.

00:30:39.624 --> 00:30:42.176
Now from even that state, you see,

00:30:42.250 --> 00:30:44.711
you can get to that,

00:30:44.860 --> 00:30:46.873
and that’s what you have to cut out –

00:30:47.087 --> 00:30:49.992
is to, when you see such a situation

00:30:50.224 --> 00:30:55.173
where you get involved, then you say, “This is not, this is not,”

00:30:55.606 --> 00:30:56.899
and come out of it.

00:30:57.283 --> 00:31:00.124
It’s a practice, a little practice can tell you.

00:31:00.529 --> 00:31:04.350
Like driving, by practice you master it in the same way.

00:31:07.430 --> 00:31:11.112
When I know something is wrong, I know it is wrong

00:31:11.156 --> 00:31:14.691
and I know that they are doing wrong, but I just keep quiet

00:31:14.721 --> 00:31:18.521
and then they know what it was wrong and what was right.

00:31:29.293 --> 00:31:34.624
It is better to make others learn by mistakes than to tell them.

00:31:34.948 --> 00:31:37.115
No one likes to be told.

00:31:37.428 --> 00:31:43.132
Then they learn themselves by mistakes,
“Yes, I’ve done this mistake, that mistakes. I’ve ruined my life.

00:31:43.197 --> 00:31:44.197
Now come along."

00:31:44.737 --> 00:31:51.389
But if you tell them, they can be very
reluctant or could be vindictive also.

00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.914
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You tell us
some more about the conscious mind?]

00:32:11.034 --> 00:32:13.739
Shri Mataji: About? – Yogi: the conscious mind.

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:15.872
The conscious mind?
Yogi: Yes.

00:32:22.127 --> 00:32:27.282
What do you want to know about the conscious mind?

00:32:27.573 --> 00:32:31.310
You see, conscious mind is the mind where you are awake

00:32:31.778 --> 00:32:34.067
and see things.

00:32:34.437 --> 00:32:37.357
But there is also unconscious mind behind it;

00:32:37.822 --> 00:32:41.782
and there’s a subconscious mind, and there’s supraconscious mind,

00:32:42.455 --> 00:32:44.713
and beyond the supraconscious

00:32:44.947 --> 00:32:47.817
there is also collective supraconscious,

00:32:48.208 --> 00:32:52.828
and beyond the subconscious there is collective subconscious.

00:32:53.013 --> 00:32:54.947
There’s unconscious mind.

00:32:55.045 --> 00:32:59.614
The unconscious mind is in a way, we can say is the Kundalini.

00:33:01.050 --> 00:33:07.407
Now when She enters into your
conscious mind, you become enlightened.

00:33:08.875 --> 00:33:13.029
The conscious mind is the mind that is aware

00:33:13.106 --> 00:33:18.514
of the surroundings, aware of
everyone being there, aware of all the things.

00:33:18.978 --> 00:33:22.668
But an enlightened conscious mind which is of a high level

00:33:22.823 --> 00:33:26.051
is much more conscious of things than you are.

00:33:26.160 --> 00:33:31.565
For example, I am quite conscious
of people who are catching on the Heart,

00:33:32.264 --> 00:33:35.892
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are not yet there.

00:33:36.099 --> 00:33:40.551
I’m quite conscious of the people who are perfectly there,

00:33:40.812 --> 00:33:44.495
and I’m quite conscious of the people who are nowhere near.

00:33:44.665 --> 00:33:50.697
But it’s all right for Me, because I with My
conscious mind can raise them up.

00:33:50.897 --> 00:33:53.230
So it’s a different situation with Me.

00:33:53.286 --> 00:33:58.465
But with other people could be
that your conscious mind is all the time,

00:33:58.744 --> 00:34:04.387
depending on your level of advancement,
maybe worried about small, small things.

00:34:04.512 --> 00:34:06.690
Like ...

00:34:07.551 --> 00:34:13.332
“I have to go home now and it’s getting late,
and will I get a bus or not?” Could be like that.

00:34:13.578 --> 00:34:17.905
Then there could be another conscious mind which is thinking about

00:34:18.032 --> 00:34:22.952
how far I can meditate,
how far I can go with it, all kinds of things.

00:34:23.209 --> 00:34:28.085
But there could be a conscious mind
which is enlightened, if it is enlightened, it’s just

00:34:29.432 --> 00:34:32.529
just getting all the

00:34:33.111 --> 00:34:35.540
essence of what I am saying,

00:34:36.016 --> 00:34:38.364
and developing and nourishing itself.

00:34:38.785 --> 00:34:42.266
So when you are enlightened, the conscious mind

00:34:42.414 --> 00:34:44.595
is something like a

00:34:45.128 --> 00:34:47.845
tree into which the sap is now flowing.

00:34:47.988 --> 00:34:51.429
It may be that it is just like a leaf

00:34:51.736 --> 00:34:56.446
or it may be it is like a flower, or maybe it is like a fruit.

00:34:57.091 --> 00:35:01.430
So it changes its forms once he gets realization.

00:35:01.722 --> 00:35:07.043
If a person gets realization then
the conscious mind moves on, getting more and more light.

00:35:07.086 --> 00:35:09.418
Say for example when the electricity comes

00:35:09.603 --> 00:35:13.194
you can see this room, you can see
another’s room, you can see another room,

00:35:13.417 --> 00:35:18.925
you can go round and see and again, again you will see
it all the rooms, then you become aware of all the rooms

00:35:19.135 --> 00:35:21.150
So you are conscious of all these.

00:35:21.293 --> 00:35:25.033
But in the beginning you are just
conscious of the room where you are standing.

00:35:25.197 --> 00:35:26.223
Isn’t it?

00:35:26.348 --> 00:35:28.263
So the conscious mind’s

00:35:28.441 --> 00:35:31.120
definition cannot be given after realization.

00:35:31.322 --> 00:35:37.618
A person like Me, say for example, has a
conscious mind that might envelop the whole world.

00:35:37.806 --> 00:35:40.909
Or a conscious mind of a person who is realized soul

00:35:41.083 --> 00:35:43.886
who is still not anywhere, just started,

00:35:44.103 --> 00:35:49.714
then he’s only conscious as to
where is right, where is left, where is this.

00:35:52.123 --> 00:35:56.648
So before the realization
the conscious mind sees things around.

00:35:56.841 --> 00:35:59.277
Out of that also there are categories.

00:35:59.382 --> 00:36:02.024
Some people see, say, for artists can see something,

00:36:02.328 --> 00:36:05.154
and a scientist can see something,

00:36:05.366 --> 00:36:07.985
another poet will see something,

00:36:08.192 --> 00:36:11.160
so it depends on the conscious mind how it is,

00:36:11.403 --> 00:36:13.545
has got the trend. But

00:36:14.142 --> 00:36:18.667
still it won’t see something that is subtle behind it.

00:36:19.063 --> 00:36:23.020
And that only is possible after you get your realization.

00:36:23.656 --> 00:36:24.751
All right?

00:36:28.836 --> 00:36:34.669
Yogi: Mother, sometimes ego masquerades as guru.

00:36:36.232 --> 00:36:39.797
How can we tell when that’s going on in us?

00:36:42.787 --> 00:36:46.693
You see, when ego comes up

00:36:47.458 --> 00:36:53.299
– I don’t know much about it, you see, because I haven’t got!

00:36:57.229 --> 00:37:00.278
We can say when ego comes up,

00:37:00.501 --> 00:37:04.453
then a person becomes arbitrary.
First thing is he becomes arbitrary.

00:37:04.883 --> 00:37:09.258
It start, He’ll start deciding, “I’ll have this, I’ll have that,

00:37:09.426 --> 00:37:13.313
I like this” – you see? This is the one thing.

00:37:13.523 --> 00:37:18.015
Secondly it takes out itself from the collective,

00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:22.465
becomes very arbitrary, collective removes itself from you.

00:37:23.025 --> 00:37:25.532
But the spirit is the other way round.

00:37:25.664 --> 00:37:28.970
Spirit is, it cares for the collective.

00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.256
It doesn’t become arbitrary at all

00:37:32.399 --> 00:37:37.240
and it never says “I like, I want.” Its “I” drops out.

00:37:37.643 --> 00:37:41.726
You see, you can easily see, very easily with your discrimination

00:37:41.932 --> 00:37:44.877
that egoistical person

00:37:45.099 --> 00:37:48.651
is not even liked by the person who has ego.

00:37:49.416 --> 00:37:55.751
If he sees himself in the mirror he says,
“Oh God, what’s this wretched nonsense? What a temperament it is!”

00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.908
It will not like itself.

00:37:58.811 --> 00:38:03.208
There was a lady who was a very hot-tempered woman

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:08.122
and once she came to My puja,
and I said, “Now what is this heater you have brought before Me

00:38:08.215 --> 00:38:12.392
in India in the hot season" – one heater put before you.

00:38:12.628 --> 00:38:16.368
I said, “Oh God, please remove her, she’s like a heater.”

00:38:16.698 --> 00:38:18.503
Nobody understood it, you see,

00:38:18.658 --> 00:38:23.732
but I said, “Please remove her.”
So then they asked her, “You get down. Mother can’t bear you.”

00:38:24.252 --> 00:38:29.669
Then she was very angry,“What is this?
What’s wrong with me? What have I done?”

00:38:30.457 --> 00:38:31.997
After some time, you see,

00:38:32.115 --> 00:38:37.765
people said that “we have nothing to do.”
Then nobody would talk to her, she was left alone,

00:38:38.086 --> 00:38:43.231
and then she was also very unhappy about it because
she was left alone. She thought, “What’s this? This is insulting.

00:38:43.279 --> 00:38:45.168
Why should they leave me alone?”

00:38:45.744 --> 00:38:47.196
Then after some time

00:38:47.323 --> 00:38:51.710
she realized that “There must be something wrong with me,

00:38:52.057 --> 00:38:56.557
I must find out. There’s something
nonsensical about it, something filthy on me.

00:38:56.715 --> 00:38:58.079
I should throw it away.”

00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:04.708
Then she started working it out and seeing
herself and all that, and she became a very, very sweet person.

00:39:05.001 --> 00:39:08.101
But she dare not face Me, was quite afraid.

00:39:08.644 --> 00:39:12.604
So her daughter came to see Me one day.
I said, “How is your mother?”

00:39:12.652 --> 00:39:16.300
She said, “Mother, she’s all right.”
“You ask her to come and see Me.”

00:39:16.783 --> 00:39:19.444
So she said, “And I have never felt such joy

00:39:19.523 --> 00:39:23.869
as I felt that day when You called me.”
I said, “I knew you have improved so much.”

00:39:23.972 --> 00:39:25.903
She came. I had taken a watch for her.

00:39:25.997 --> 00:39:29.757
She said, “Mother, You have brought a watch for me?”
I said, “Yes, I have brought a watch for you.”

00:39:29.803 --> 00:39:34.515
She said, “Thank God that filth is gone, thank God! Fed up of it!”

00:39:34.851 --> 00:39:39.820
That’s how when you develop, then
that sweetness, the beauty, everything comes up.

00:39:40.481 --> 00:39:42.526
But you see the ego is,

00:39:42.716 --> 00:39:47.022
if you play upon your ego it adheres to you.

00:39:47.288 --> 00:39:51.073
You get identified with it, and you cannot get rid of it.

00:39:51.237 --> 00:39:54.341
But I have seen one case which is such a beautiful case is,

00:39:54.559 --> 00:40:00.936
and I was sitting in My room and I could feel with the
child when she came in. And I asked her, “Where is your mother?”

00:40:01.126 --> 00:40:05.888
She was herself surprised. When she told her mother.
She said, “I’ve never had such a joy!

00:40:06.283 --> 00:40:07.742
Such a joy I had

00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:12.887
that, oh, Mother has recognized me.”
I said, “I always recognized you.”

00:40:14.109 --> 00:40:16.568
So this is what it is.

00:40:31.604 --> 00:40:40.586
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus...

00:40:41.499 --> 00:40:47.273
What she said?
Yogi: You have to speek up. Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Please.

00:40:47.432 --> 00:40:52.109
Yogini: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower.

00:40:52.418 --> 00:40:58.843
Yogi repeats: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus flower

00:40:59.364 --> 00:41:09.860
Yogini: At the moment, if the lotus flower,
starting to lose its petals and the fruit developed?

00:41:14.433 --> 00:41:18.373
Yogi: The Sahastrara is represented by the lotus,

00:41:18.578 --> 00:41:23.223
and is the lotus at the moment...is the lotus loosing its petals?

00:41:23.429 --> 00:41:25.754
And the fruit developing.

00:41:27.875 --> 00:41:34.043
You see, it is represented as lotus
because our brain is like a lotus, actually.

00:41:34.433 --> 00:41:37.421
If you cut it horizontally you can see

00:41:37.541 --> 00:41:41.213
as if you have cut the petals,

00:41:41.609 --> 00:41:45.073
and if you cut it vertically

00:41:45.312 --> 00:41:48.100
you can see that around the

00:41:48.274 --> 00:41:52.998
around the limbic area it is just like petals of lotus

00:41:53.434 --> 00:41:58.155
But when you are enlightened
what happens, they swell up and they open out,

00:41:58.346 --> 00:42:00.838
and they all have beautiful colors.

00:42:00.965 --> 00:42:04.306
They look like tongues of flames, it’s very beautiful.

00:42:04.704 --> 00:42:07.227
Now the Sahastrara is open

00:42:07.498 --> 00:42:09.655
and the lotus is open,

00:42:09.775 --> 00:42:14.114
and inside you find the fruit already there kept,

00:42:14.296 --> 00:42:17.684
which is the Agya Chakra, which sits there.

00:42:18.028 --> 00:42:22.369
You can see it very clearly. Agnya is yellow,

00:42:23.466 --> 00:42:26.994
yellow-covered as we say,

00:42:27.073 --> 00:42:30.530
like a gold cap

00:42:30.655 --> 00:42:34.114
is the Agnya there, beautiful Agnya is inside.

00:42:34.304 --> 00:42:40.117
Now the fruit of the lotus

00:42:40.839 --> 00:42:43.853
is later on we see,

00:42:44.298 --> 00:42:50.605
and I would say that is called
as Bindu state, where you become a bindu

00:42:51.264 --> 00:42:54.954
– a dot, it’s a little dot

00:42:55.251 --> 00:42:57.536
– and that dot has to then grow.

00:42:57.988 --> 00:43:00.416
So it’s the second stage starts

00:43:00.453 --> 00:43:03.461
when you become the fruit of the lotus.

00:43:12.339 --> 00:43:17.978
Yogi: Shri Mother, could You say something
about these higher chakras above the Sahasrara?

00:43:18.279 --> 00:43:19.823
Shri Mataji: What chakra?

00:43:20.133 --> 00:43:28.765
Yogi: I heard people talk about Bindu and
Adi Bindu and the higher chakras above that?

00:43:29.475 --> 00:43:32.776
You see, I don’t think you should worry too much about these.

00:43:33.204 --> 00:43:38.622
These three stages higher than Sahastrara.

00:43:39.749 --> 00:43:42.048
I would suggest just now

00:43:42.175 --> 00:43:45.654
let us concentrate on Sahastrara, is a better idea.

00:43:46.328 --> 00:43:50.401
But Bindu, Ardha-Bindu and Valaya are the three stages

00:43:50.473 --> 00:43:53.323
in which one has to pass through later on,

00:43:53.702 --> 00:43:56.259
and you would pass gradually

00:43:56.511 --> 00:43:59.019
when you develop yourself horizontally.

00:43:59.193 --> 00:44:01.193
That’s what we have started now,

00:44:01.328 --> 00:44:06.112
so let us keep to this idea that
we have to develop ourself horizontally.

00:44:06.492 --> 00:44:09.608
We should see how we affect

00:44:10.479 --> 00:44:12.791
the other person,

00:44:12.911 --> 00:44:15.863
how we influence the another person.

00:44:15.983 --> 00:44:20.565
For example some people, you see,
they are very egoistical and all that,

00:44:20.716 --> 00:44:26.533
they may come in contact with you
and say, “Oh, very nice person, charming person, this, that.”

00:44:26.742 --> 00:44:32.090
But actually that person is just
very physically may be attractive, or

00:44:32.214 --> 00:44:38.368
or may be a little brilliant type of person but doesn’t have anything much in it.

00:44:38.495 --> 00:44:42.263
But if that person standing next to you, changes

00:44:42.529 --> 00:44:45.081
the mood and temperament of another person,

00:44:45.324 --> 00:44:49.662
then you can say that this person has a spiritual personality.

00:44:50.249 --> 00:44:52.872
So let us see how you affect the nature.

00:44:53.034 --> 00:44:54.418
Flowers

00:44:54.568 --> 00:44:58.963
– you saw the miracle of the flowers
that I performed for you  the other day.

00:44:59.467 --> 00:45:01.038
In the same way

00:45:01.110 --> 00:45:05.294
let us see what is the effect of your character on the

00:45:05.694 --> 00:45:09.466
on the trees, on your friends,

00:45:09.566 --> 00:45:11.921
or in the food that you make – everything

00:45:11.978 --> 00:45:13.986
everything changes, it’s very beautiful.

00:45:14.184 --> 00:45:17.070
So we have to see that, how it works out.

00:45:17.182 --> 00:45:22.110
I have known people who have never known
what is poetry is, suddenly they become poets.

00:45:22.378 --> 00:45:25.320
Some who were never musicians started singing so well.

00:45:25.447 --> 00:45:27.185
Like Christine, you know Christine,

00:45:27.275 --> 00:45:29.950
she never used to sing, she had a horrible voice.

00:45:30.172 --> 00:45:34.628
And suddenly she started singing like a cuckoo-bird!

00:45:37.722 --> 00:45:43.077
So not only you, but on others
what effect is had? What others feel about you?

00:45:43.248 --> 00:45:45.064
You see, how you are kind,

00:45:45.157 --> 00:45:49.725
good and sweet to others, not superficially,

00:45:49.906 --> 00:45:53.522
but your behavior should change another person,

00:45:53.967 --> 00:45:55.898
transform another person.

00:45:55.959 --> 00:46:00.266
Your presence should bring auspiciousness.

00:46:21.988 --> 00:46:33.093
[Yogi: Shri Mataji, how can we develop
that same heart that poets like Kabir have for You?]

00:46:33.429 --> 00:46:37.487
Shri Mataji: Same heart as what? - Yogi: Kabir, like Kabir.

00:46:38.589 --> 00:46:39.875
Why not?

00:46:42.061 --> 00:46:44.525
See the handicap of Kabir.

00:46:45.445 --> 00:46:47.445
You have no handicaps.

00:46:48.023 --> 00:46:51.937
Kabir had no Mother to tell him, no Mother to love him,

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:55.134
look after him and tell him all these things.

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:59.412
He had a guru, if you know Kabir’s life.

00:46:59.665 --> 00:47:07.295
Kabir wanted to become the disciple of Ramananda Swami,

00:47:07.643 --> 00:47:11.556
but he was a Muslim or low-caste or whatever it is,

00:47:11.945 --> 00:47:15.385
so he could not  reach Ramanand Swami.

00:47:15.526 --> 00:47:19.778
The disciples would not allow him to go near Ramanand Swami.

00:47:20.007 --> 00:47:28.076
So one day Kabira went and slept on the

00:47:29.015 --> 00:47:34.807
steps of the River Ganges, all night in the cold

00:47:34.961 --> 00:47:37.972
waiting for Ramanand Swami to come,

00:47:38.163 --> 00:47:41.215
because he used to always pass the same way.

00:47:41.501 --> 00:47:46.101
And his feet fell on Kabira

00:47:46.492 --> 00:47:50.317
and he said, “Oh my child, what are you doing here?”

00:47:50.739 --> 00:47:56.454
So Kabira got up and he said, “Sir,
you have accepted me as your disciple today.”

00:47:56.454 --> 00:47:58.026
He said, “Yes, I have.”

00:47:58.101 --> 00:48:02.037
And then Ramanand Swami took him and he

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:04.278
trained him into something great.

00:48:04.462 --> 00:48:07.048
You don’t have these handicaps,

00:48:07.448 --> 00:48:12.039
where Kabira never had anybody to support him or help him around.

00:48:12.225 --> 00:48:15.573
Actually single-handed he fought the whole world.

00:48:17.143 --> 00:48:21.814
Horrible people were around him; even today those who are

00:48:22.496 --> 00:48:27.928
in his place in Patna on all places where he lived

00:48:28.097 --> 00:48:32.464
– I was self surprised that he described Kundalini as “surathi”

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:35.004
and they described tobacco as “surathi.”

00:48:35.146 --> 00:48:39.210
Such horrible nonsensical people, making fun of everything.

00:48:39.670 --> 00:48:42.602
There Kabira lived and developed that heart.

00:48:42.701 --> 00:48:46.407
You don’t have all these handicaps, at all.

00:48:46.736 --> 00:48:51.206
You all speak the same language, you live with the same ideas,

00:48:51.371 --> 00:48:54.929
you have your own Mother to tell you everything,

00:48:55.032 --> 00:48:59.961
so you can develop the same heart as Kabira had.

00:49:03.208 --> 00:49:12.403
Yogi: Mother, when I meditate sometimes I can see beautiful,

00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:24.832
like a massive flower coming out of the head or a beautiful,
sort of a golden like, almost like a vase.

00:49:25.116 --> 00:49:34.923
And I’ve been asking people, and they don’t know
really the answer, and I don’t know it either.

00:49:35.246 --> 00:49:38.238
That’s the Kundalini that you see.

00:49:38.414 --> 00:49:40.430
It is like a telescope, you see

00:49:40.629 --> 00:49:48.638
like a goldenish, yellowish sort of a, like a heated, like iron...

00:49:48.836 --> 00:49:50.337
Yogi: It’s like a furnace.

00:49:50.543 --> 00:49:53.639
Yes, furnace, it’s like a furnace. That’s the Kundalini you see,

00:49:53.774 --> 00:49:57.115
and that’s a good thing to see. But when you see you are not there,

00:49:57.288 --> 00:50:02.470
so it’s better is not to see that. But what you see is that,

00:50:02.590 --> 00:50:05.658
is the Kundalini. It’s good, I mean seeing is very good,

00:50:05.800 --> 00:50:10.375
but to go beyond it. Say,
“No, I don’t want to see it. Now I want to enter into it.”

00:50:10.571 --> 00:50:16.353
Yogi: Yes. Last night for instance
I was sleeping with my little girl,

00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:24.721
and in her bed she asked me to come. And we meditated,
and it was enormous and I woke up, suddenly woke up.

00:50:24.966 --> 00:50:26.482
In your dream you saw?

00:50:26.668 --> 00:50:30.574
Yogi: I don’t know whether it was a dream or
whether I was still meditating, but ….

00:50:30.749 --> 00:50:32.598
In dream if you see is very good,

00:50:32.741 --> 00:50:37.362
but otherwise in meditation you should not see it.
In the dream if you see, is very good.

00:50:37.553 --> 00:50:42.384
It’s the Kundalini itself, it’s like a furnace,
it looks like a silent burning furnace.

00:50:42.514 --> 00:50:46.068
Yogi: Sometimes like fireworks. It’s quite beautiful.

00:50:46.384 --> 00:50:53.032
Yes. But you shouldn’t see it
anymore, all right? Try to avoid.

00:50:54.863 --> 00:50:59.474
Yogi: Shri Mataji, could You just say
something about how we pure attention?

00:50:59.696 --> 00:51:03.699
Shri Mataji: Pure?
Yogi: Pure attention, how we purify the attention.

00:51:03.859 --> 00:51:08.651
How we look beyond the human form
and the differences between each other?

00:51:08.811 --> 00:51:11.251
Pure attention?

00:51:12.321 --> 00:51:18.645
You see, your attention gets spoilt
that when you put attention – say I put attention onto this glass,

00:51:18.709 --> 00:51:23.149
then I start thinking about this glass that
“Oh, it’s a beautiful glass so now,

00:51:23.340 --> 00:51:25.990
so it’s a very beautifully done one.

00:51:26.201 --> 00:51:30.351
Now somehow or other I should manage to steal it!”

00:51:43.399 --> 00:51:50.735
Then attention moves further, “How can I manage to steal this?

00:51:51.781 --> 00:51:55.506
And what should I do, what is the best way of stealing it?”

00:51:55.648 --> 00:52:01.739
and all those things. So the attention gives,
you see, into problems and problems because I have got

00:52:01.921 --> 00:52:05.423
for this a greed, I develop a greed.

00:52:05.534 --> 00:52:09.794
How I’ve developed? Because you see, supposing

00:52:10.419 --> 00:52:15.578
I put My attention to it and then a thought
starts from there coming to Me,

00:52:15.681 --> 00:52:18.813
a reaction as such, this gives you a reaction.

00:52:18.972 --> 00:52:21.830
Then you start seeing a beautiful Ganesha there,

00:52:21.902 --> 00:52:24.552
then you say, “Oh, I have never seen one like this!”

00:52:24.647 --> 00:52:27.555
Like that the thought starts, you see,coming from all this.

00:52:27.662 --> 00:52:30.233
And that thought comes into My mind

00:52:30.282 --> 00:52:33.842
and gives Me ideas that I should do something like that,

00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:35.837
to steal the glass. All right?

00:52:35.977 --> 00:52:40.977
Now, the pure attention would be
that I just watch this without thinking.

00:52:42.310 --> 00:52:47.016
Anywhere that your attention goes and you start sort of

00:52:47.416 --> 00:52:52.185
getting involved into it or getting attached to it,

00:52:52.341 --> 00:52:57.150
you should try to just watch it without thinking.

00:52:57.420 --> 00:53:00.567
Go into thoughtless awareness, then you enjoy it the most.

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:04.480
Now say for example, these carpets are very nice.

00:53:04.837 --> 00:53:09.873
One thing would be, if they belonged to Me
I would be worried how to insure them

00:53:09.956 --> 00:53:15.121
all these people aresitting, that would be spoilt, this, hat –
all these thoughts will come into My head.

00:53:15.324 --> 00:53:19.714
Supposing these belonged to you, then I’ll think how to manage to

00:53:20.117 --> 00:53:24.192
take them with Me somehow,

00:53:30.307 --> 00:53:37.667
and how to suggest in a very clever way
something that I can manage to take them away!

00:53:39.271 --> 00:53:43.882
Now that is quite human and one can do that way,

00:53:43.990 --> 00:53:49.133
but beyond that all cleverness and cunning,

00:53:49.860 --> 00:53:51.946
best is to appreciate.

00:53:52.121 --> 00:53:55.845
How? By just looking at it without any thought.

00:53:56.201 --> 00:54:01.718
Artist has created it, he has put all
his joy into it. I’m just enjoying the joy,

00:54:02.155 --> 00:54:03.530
just looking at it.

00:54:03.655 --> 00:54:10.666
So when you start enjoying the joy
your attention will become pure, very pure.

00:54:11.073 --> 00:54:14.813
Because the enjoyment of it is, this makes you

00:54:14.901 --> 00:54:19.905
a very sort of a dedicated person about it,

00:54:20.108 --> 00:54:23.693
because you feel that what is in this world after all?

00:54:24.007 --> 00:54:29.491
It’s to enjoy. And if I have to enjoy
everything, then why should I worry

00:54:29.675 --> 00:54:38.541
about getting it to Myself or stealing it,
or doing all these tricks? Better is to enjoy.

00:54:39.886 --> 00:54:46.163
So the reward of it is so great
that attention starts purifying itself.

00:54:47.614 --> 00:54:52.482
[Yogi: We tend to sort of react to
things before we even know that we’ve reacted.

00:54:52.614 --> 00:54:56.880
It seems to be such a fast process
that we look and we react in seconds.]

00:54:57.465 --> 00:55:03.282
Yes, in the beginning it is,
because you are coming from that, you see, style

00:55:03.470 --> 00:55:08.675
to the other style.
But once you settle in this style, then you’ll just react

00:55:08.904 --> 00:55:11.753
in this manner that you’ll just watch.

00:55:12.159 --> 00:55:15.341
But it otherwise also works out. I’ll tell you a story.

00:55:15.735 --> 00:55:22.526
They had given Me about sixteen
beautiful crowns – of course I couldn’t wear them

00:55:22.709 --> 00:55:28.184
– for this Krishna Puja in Switzerland, and

00:55:28.933 --> 00:55:33.674
all the English were bringing them, “smuggling” them into England,

00:55:34.064 --> 00:55:36.966
and all these boxes were kept.

00:55:37.331 --> 00:55:39.355
So when they reached the custom

00:55:39.447 --> 00:55:44.523
post, the custom post asked them,
“What are all these?” They said, “All right, you can have a look."

00:55:44.784 --> 00:55:46.831
So they passed on one to them.

00:55:46.983 --> 00:55:51.058
So the first fellow looked at it and then he passed to another one,

00:55:51.182 --> 00:55:57.500
then another one given. Like that
four were passed on to them, and they were all looking at it.

00:55:57.751 --> 00:56:02.729
And then they said, “Now what do you say?”
Nothing. They closed it and gave it to them.

00:56:03.912 --> 00:56:09.660
Then they looked back – these boys,
what has happened to them where they were?

00:56:09.890 --> 00:56:13.294
They just were moving like this.

00:56:13.526 --> 00:56:18.295
And so many cars passed but these people
never looked at any cars, they were just ….

00:56:19.010 --> 00:56:22.858
So they had a bliss casualty

00:56:30.504 --> 00:56:34.282
– also this can happen, bliss casualty!

00:56:41.228 --> 00:56:46.311
So better to see things which can cause bliss casualty!

00:56:47.154 --> 00:56:52.808
And once you get into that habit,
then you don’t take to other useless things.

00:56:53.226 --> 00:56:57.805
Then you like to see only things which can give you bliss.

00:56:58.491 --> 00:57:00.594
Your attention changes.

00:57:04.062 --> 00:57:07.514
Yogi: Mother, please, what is the Aumkara?

00:57:07.942 --> 00:57:09.416
The Aumkara?

00:57:09.758 --> 00:57:11.567
Is the first sound.

00:57:12.480 --> 00:57:21.032
When the Shakti departed from Sadashiva,

00:57:21.476 --> 00:57:25.472
from the God Almighty – His Power, His Desire

00:57:25.731 --> 00:57:28.207
departed – it made the first sound:

00:57:28.430 --> 00:57:31.692
that’s the first Child, we say, of God.

00:57:32.405 --> 00:57:35.405
That’s Aumkara. A-U-M is the thing,

00:57:35.754 --> 00:57:40.804
and these are the three Powers which are represented

00:57:42.510 --> 00:57:46.152
as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:57:46.554 --> 00:57:53.475
And also all these are combined together to form Shri Ganesh.

00:57:58.791 --> 00:58:01.648
Yogi: Mother, what is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

00:58:01.855 --> 00:58:08.003
Shri Mataji: What is the…?
Yogi: What is Your vision for Sahaja Yoga?

00:58:11.453 --> 00:58:15.135
This is the one, started already!

00:58:16.466 --> 00:58:20.616
My vision for Sahaja Yoga is that, that

00:58:21.816 --> 00:58:25.152
all the good people, righteous people,

00:58:26.212 --> 00:58:28.371
God-loving people

00:58:28.759 --> 00:58:34.823
will rise above all that is useless, worldly,

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:39.912
and reside in the Heavens

00:58:40.124 --> 00:58:45.764
with all the blessings of God, for ever and ever.

00:58:53.959 --> 00:58:54.959
All right?

00:58:55.475 --> 00:59:00.165
So we can have a music,
because without that you won’t feel it is complete.

00:59:02.495 --> 00:59:05.765
Let’s hear the song …

01:00:55.544 --> 01:01:00.361
Did you hear the tape from Pune children?

01:01:00.787 --> 01:01:04.286
Wasn’t it fine? Very good, isn’t it?

01:01:04.957 --> 01:01:08.636
You have to make copies of that and send it over.

01:01:08.902 --> 01:01:14.080
It’s very good music and very good songs …
Yogi: Queen of Sahasrara...

01:01:17.956 --> 01:01:21.813
Such small girls they are, you see, all of them.

01:01:22.033 --> 01:01:25.306
They have made and composed everything done,

01:01:25.357 --> 01:01:30.696
and sang so clearly. It’s really remarkable.
Nobody has taught them anything.
