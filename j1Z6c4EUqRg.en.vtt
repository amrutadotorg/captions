00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.561
The other day I was telling you

00:00:03.681 --> 00:00:08.535
about our growth within, after Self-realisation.

00:00:09.114 --> 00:00:16.216
The germination takes place very easily;

00:00:16.454 --> 00:00:21.871
the Kundalini rises very easily;

00:00:21.991 --> 00:00:32.054
also pierces the fontanelle bone area very easily.

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:36.394
That is really, as you call it, ‘Sahaja’.

00:00:38.092 --> 00:00:40.526
It’s a tremendous happening.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:45.682
It takes thousands of years for people to get realisation.

00:00:45.802 --> 00:00:47.956
That’s also a fact.

00:00:49.464 --> 00:00:52.014
They had to be born again and again

00:00:52.134 --> 00:00:57.924
and very few selected got realisation.

00:00:59.477 --> 00:01:03.478
But today, as I said, the time has come

00:01:06.561 --> 00:01:11.008
for many flowers to become fruits.

00:01:12.647 --> 00:01:17.467
So this happening doesn’t take much time,

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.482
it’s just [a] split of a second in many people.

00:01:22.323 --> 00:01:26.446
But about the growth I was talking last time,

00:01:26.566 --> 00:01:32.022
I ended up at Self-realisation, what is Self-realisation is

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:37.327
and what do we expect from Self-realisation.

00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:41.864
The first thing that happens to you, as you know,

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:44.607
when the Kundalini rises, [is]

00:01:47.187 --> 00:01:52.574
that you start feeling physically better; your health improves.

00:01:53.588 --> 00:01:59.350
Though the Kundalini rises from the centre most nadi,

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.093
called as Brahmanadi, inside the Sushumna, in the central part.

00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:14.596
And first thing that happens is the physical being which is helped.

00:02:16.366 --> 00:02:21.634
That is not the innermost core of every centre.

00:02:21.754 --> 00:02:28.175
The innermost core of every centre is the Spiritual.

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:34.080
But how is it [that] first the physical being is helped?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.480
Is very interesting to see.

00:02:38.012 --> 00:02:47.033
The Kundalini rises through many centres, passes through Agya,

00:02:47.153 --> 00:02:49.102
pierces through fontanelle,

00:02:49.222 --> 00:02:53.749
and becomes one with the All-pervading Power.

00:02:56.737 --> 00:03:02.813
So, first thing that receives the information is the seat of Sadashiva,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:08.343
is the seat of your Atma, your Spirit, on top of your head.

00:03:08.463 --> 00:03:11.164
But the Spirit is in your heart.

00:03:11.284 --> 00:03:15.596
So the first awakening takes place, or enlightenment takes place,

00:03:15.716 --> 00:03:19.600
in your brain. It’s a very important point to be seen.

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.904
In your brain resides the conscious mind,

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:30.931
that means the present,

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:40.258
and when it is enlightened that means your awareness is enlightened;

00:03:40.378 --> 00:03:43.847
you get enlightenment in your awareness,

00:03:46.502 --> 00:03:48.465
in your attention.

00:03:48.585 --> 00:03:52.976
As I told you last time that attention is enlightened first.

00:03:53.096 --> 00:03:55.458
So through your attention you can find out

00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:58.422
what is the matter with other persons, you can find out

00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:00.193
what centres are catching,

00:04:00.313 --> 00:04:05.150
what your centres are catching. So, on the physical level,

00:04:09.772 --> 00:04:12.422
you know what’s happening.

00:04:14.438 --> 00:04:18.523
That’s the, we should say, the present.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.520
We feel our gross (physical) being enlightened,

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.690
we can feel them on our fingers.

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:37.121
But when the Kundalini is rising in your being,

00:04:38.581 --> 00:04:44.526
She goes straight on to the fontanelle bone area.

00:04:45.058 --> 00:04:49.006
Of course, if there is a hurdle or anything then She stops

00:04:49.126 --> 00:04:51.605
and tries to indicate.

00:04:54.668 --> 00:04:58.043
At that time, if She is not successful,

00:04:58.163 --> 00:05:01.360
for example you have got a liver problem,

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.530
then She will come and throb at liver problem,

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:07.548
informing you that there’s something wrong with the liver.

00:05:07.668 --> 00:05:12.825
That’s why a Sahaja Yogi has to give vibrations from outside.

00:05:14.936 --> 00:05:22.258
When the Kundalini rises above the Agya,

00:05:24.903 --> 00:05:28.581
She goes up to this fontanelle and pierces.

00:05:28.701 --> 00:05:33.832
But when She cannot go beyond Agya She spreads out here.

00:05:35.649 --> 00:05:38.669
She can spread out here also.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.526
And then She starts trickling down,

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.150
the grace on the…

00:05:48.691 --> 00:05:54.157
or you can say She starts relaxing

00:05:54.832 --> 00:05:58.709
this area which is called as murdha (brain)

00:05:58.935 --> 00:06:05.072
and that’s how She makes more space in the Agya.

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:10.924
And this relaxation works out the outer side of the physical being.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.461
Also when She pierces through

00:06:14.581 --> 00:06:23.378
in anyone who has a simpler personality,

00:06:23.498 --> 00:06:28.266
who is not so complicated, first thing that happens

00:06:28.386 --> 00:06:32.375
is that the grace starts falling through from the sides;

00:06:32.495 --> 00:06:39.470
and the Grace starts falling into the Ida and Pingala

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:47.421
and then She comes down by which She supplies Ida and Pingala.

00:06:47.541 --> 00:06:50.305
The Grace, not the Kundalini,

00:06:50.425 --> 00:06:53.828
you should not confuse these two things.

00:06:55.074 --> 00:06:57.581
Because of Her piercing, there’s an opening made

00:06:57.701 --> 00:07:02.963
and the Grace starts coming down, and She,

00:07:03.598 --> 00:07:11.520
I should say the Grace Itself, feeds all the centres from outside.

00:07:12.813 --> 00:07:16.883
So, first the physical being is improves.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:29.801
The second one, I’m now going from outside inside,

00:07:32.516 --> 00:07:40.448
the second one is the mental being.

00:07:42.781 --> 00:07:47.649
Now the mental being relates to our awareness as well,

00:07:48.775 --> 00:07:53.937
also to our sense of understanding, intellect and all those things.

00:07:55.398 --> 00:07:59.681
When the Grace starts flowing more and more within us,

00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:04.051
then our mental being gets enlightened.

00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.541
When the mental being gets enlightened

00:08:07.661 --> 00:08:12.474
then you start feeling centres of other persons.

00:08:14.853 --> 00:08:18.432
Some people you know just get cured.

00:08:19.217 --> 00:08:22.890
They don’t feel any vibrations, nothing, just they feel cured.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:26.935
They get cured of cancer, this, that, all sorts of things.

00:08:27.055 --> 00:08:30.605
But they do not get vibrations, they do not get a feeling,

00:08:30.725 --> 00:08:34.782
they cannot make out whether it is this chakra or that chakra,

00:08:34.902 --> 00:08:37.192
they do not feel anything.

00:08:39.231 --> 00:08:43.977
So the first thing that would happen to anyone is the physical gift,

00:08:44.097 --> 00:08:48.949
the physical being improves – that’s the Grace of God.

00:08:49.988 --> 00:08:52.047
Because if you are not well,

00:08:52.167 --> 00:08:56.344
if you have some pains and some troubles and some diseases,

00:08:56.464 --> 00:09:00.628
how are you going to pay attention to God and Spirit?

00:09:01.676 --> 00:09:03.973
That’s very important.

00:09:06.139 --> 00:09:09.710
But before it comes to the mental self,

00:09:13.227 --> 00:09:16.194
something else happens also,

00:09:18.368 --> 00:09:21.715
that, when the Kundalini pierces,

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:29.657
the falling of Grace first comes down

00:09:31.168 --> 00:09:36.722
to the lower centres starting from Nabhi downwards.

00:09:38.064 --> 00:09:44.522
And Nabhi is a great sucker, Nabhi starts sucking the vibrations,

00:09:44.642 --> 00:09:47.241
or you can say the Grace.

00:09:48.003 --> 00:09:53.924
And Nabhi starts getting awakened first of all.

00:09:54.717 --> 00:09:59.738
From Nabhi rises the Swadhishthana Chakra which goes round and round,

00:09:59.858 --> 00:10:05.895
which is connected with Nabhi, so it flows to Swadhishthana

00:10:06.419 --> 00:10:12.847
and then Swadhishthana also starts working out itself.

00:10:16.470 --> 00:10:19.515
Swadhishthana sucks in as much as possible

00:10:19.635 --> 00:10:23.270
and works out all the centres,

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:27.485
I mean all the organs, which are supplied by it.

00:10:30.247 --> 00:10:38.974
But Nabhi, when it receives surplus Grace,

00:10:40.892 --> 00:10:43.565
then it starts opening,

00:10:46.041 --> 00:10:56.070
and its opening helps us in very gross material life also.

00:10:58.974 --> 00:11:01.524
You are helped materially.

00:11:01.644 --> 00:11:05.574
Supposing if you are materially absolutely hopeless,

00:11:05.694 --> 00:11:09.609
then you are not going to pay attention to God also.

00:11:09.729 --> 00:11:12.287
So it’s the responsibility of God

00:11:12.407 --> 00:11:15.639
to first give you a little material well-being.

00:11:15.759 --> 00:11:18.492
Like I received a letter and also on the tape

00:11:18.612 --> 00:11:24.282
they have mentioned about somebody who wanted to come to India, from Australia.

00:11:24.782 --> 00:11:28.529
She got her realisation, she felt very much better,

00:11:28.846 --> 00:11:34.784
and she wanted to come to India but she had no money to come,

00:11:34.904 --> 00:11:40.459
and that desire was there. Because of that desire in her

00:11:40.579 --> 00:11:46.980
she may not have put full attention to her Spirit.

00:11:48.773 --> 00:11:53.116
And that’s how our material desires get satisfied.

00:11:53.625 --> 00:11:57.960
And her daughter discovered, she had a bracelet,

00:11:58.080 --> 00:12:01.243
many bracelets and things she had, and she went to a jumble sale,

00:12:01.363 --> 00:12:08.336
for selling them for some sort of a programme they had for children.

00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.311
And they discovered that one of the bracelets that she had,

00:12:12.431 --> 00:12:17.686
which she thought to be a junk, was of gold, surprisingly.

00:12:17.806 --> 00:12:21.773
And she sold it for $1500.

00:12:21.893 --> 00:12:26.124
She was going to sell it for 20c, you see,.

00:12:26.244 --> 00:12:32.402
And that was exactly the amount needed for their travel, for both of them.

00:12:33.132 --> 00:12:37.429
Now one would say that – how it works out?

00:12:39.187 --> 00:12:45.114
It is miraculous, that’s all I can say, because the machinery is such.

00:12:45.931 --> 00:12:57.014
The pouring of the Grace within you, informs the Lakshmi Principle in the Nabhi.

00:12:57.134 --> 00:12:58.889
Nabhi just show them where is this.

00:12:59.009 --> 00:13:01.161
Somebody has to get up and show them,

00:13:01.281 --> 00:13:05.033
Douglas? Or someone. Douglas (Fry) come along.

00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.534
This is the one. And this has the deity of Lakshmi,

00:13:13.654 --> 00:13:16.736
She is the deity of your well-being.

00:13:17.197 --> 00:13:21.257
And this is what Krishna has said, “Yoga Kshema vahamyam”

00:13:21.377 --> 00:13:22.712
“When the yoga takes place,

00:13:22.832 --> 00:13:26.413
means when the Kundalini pierces through fontanelle bone area,

00:13:26.533 --> 00:13:32.198
I look after your well-being.” How does he look after? Through Lakshmi.

00:13:32.682 --> 00:13:39.505
Now this is a universal Deity. She’s present in human beings

00:13:39.625 --> 00:13:44.258
and also she is present in material things.

00:13:48.047 --> 00:13:51.848
It is such a fantastic thing

00:13:53.582 --> 00:13:56.827
that you cannot explain these things

00:13:56.947 --> 00:13:59.552
on human level, really it is difficult.

00:13:59.672 --> 00:14:03.317
Only thing you can see for yourself how it works out.

00:14:03.437 --> 00:14:07.211
It’s so tremendous. Like if you have to explain

00:14:07.331 --> 00:14:10.976
about human civilisation to an ant it’s going to be difficult –

00:14:11.096 --> 00:14:14.352
in the same way it is. It’s so difficult you see.

00:14:14.472 --> 00:14:17.336
And human beings they are so proud of their rationality

00:14:17.456 --> 00:14:21.023
and I find it impossible how to explain, but it does work that way.

00:14:21.143 --> 00:14:23.931
You can only see the working of it.

00:14:24.432 --> 00:14:27.902
But if you are proud of your rationality you go ahead with it,

00:14:28.022 --> 00:14:32.962
what can you do? But you just see for yourself how it works.

00:14:34.427 --> 00:14:40.448
So the second layer that really is improved is your material being.

00:14:40.568 --> 00:14:45.683
So many people have been helped, who are here, materially.

00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:54.723
The well-being has come, actual well-being, apart from satisfaction.

00:14:54.843 --> 00:14:57.544
But as I said, it does not cross the limit,

00:14:57.664 --> 00:15:00.263
like you do not become Mr. Ford!

00:15:02.215 --> 00:15:06.684
Because that’s some sort of a behaviour which is asahaja,

00:15:06.804 --> 00:15:10.688
to be so rich, I mean it’s ridiculous, vulgar!

00:15:12.783 --> 00:15:19.665
You become better than what you are, but not the best,

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:26.917
because you have to be in the centre at a satisfied point.

00:15:27.195 --> 00:15:30.368
And everybody has to enjoy you

00:15:33.085 --> 00:15:35.626
and you have to enjoy everybody.

00:15:35.746 --> 00:15:40.856
But supposing if you are in dire necessities and problematic things

00:15:40.998 --> 00:15:44.861
then you cannot pay attention to God and that’s what He understands –

00:15:44.981 --> 00:15:46.138
that you cannot.

00:15:46.258 --> 00:15:49.658
If you have physical problem, if you have cancer,

00:15:49.778 --> 00:15:52.384
how can you say that, “You pay attention to your Spirit,”

00:15:52.504 --> 00:15:54.441
when you have cancer? I mean, such a body!

00:15:54.561 --> 00:15:57.452
After all if this whole house is going to collapse

00:15:57.572 --> 00:15:59.755
you cannot meditate here.

00:16:00.795 --> 00:16:06.484
So, first the physical stability is established and second is the material one.

00:16:07.254 --> 00:16:12.724
And there are many factors which work out material stability, automatically.

00:16:14.136 --> 00:16:18.880
First of them is that, once you find your Spirit,

00:16:20.959 --> 00:16:26.126
you just automatically give up your habits.

00:16:26.904 --> 00:16:30.060
Most of these habits come from your Nabhi,

00:16:30.180 --> 00:16:33.763
because from Nabhi Chakra you get your seeking.

00:16:34.215 --> 00:16:38.259
And you think, when you have a habit [that] you are seeking your joy.

00:16:38.379 --> 00:16:42.938
I mean, many people have said, “Mother, but I enjoy my glass of whiskey,”

00:16:43.058 --> 00:16:45.164
they have said to me, many a times.

00:16:45.284 --> 00:16:49.350
Or, “I enjoy a little ride here and there,”

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:53.279
somebody has said that, “Mother, I enjoy some Kensington ladies,”

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:55.343
you see, sort of thing.

00:16:55.772 --> 00:17:00.007
But once you start enjoying your Spirit, it drops out.

00:17:00.127 --> 00:17:08.141
All your attention becomes enlightened and your priorities change.

00:17:08.261 --> 00:17:10.955
You don’t enjoy these things that you have been enjoying before,

00:17:11.081 --> 00:17:13.483
so you just don’t do it. I mean, I don’t have to tell you,

00:17:13.626 --> 00:17:15.942
“Don’t drink!” you just don’t do it.

00:17:16.062 --> 00:17:19.212
I don’t have to tell you that you don’t smoke, you just don’t do.

00:17:19.339 --> 00:17:22.230
But there are some very weak people, extremely weak, I mean,

00:17:22.350 --> 00:17:24.898
very, very weak people. They take time, I know.

00:17:25.018 --> 00:17:32.972
They plod and they are very slow moving creatures, but not all.

00:17:39.266 --> 00:17:44.090
I would say quite a small number and

00:17:45.590 --> 00:17:51.005
most of the people, they just give up things. You just give up.

00:17:51.513 --> 00:17:55.191
So you start saving money, automatically,

00:17:56.326 --> 00:18:00.989
because the money goes to the races or to the pubs

00:18:01.109 --> 00:18:04.370
or to other habits which are useless, you know they are useless:

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:07.102
smoking, drugs,

00:18:07.222 --> 00:18:12.256
any such foolish things that you are wasting money on.

00:18:12.376 --> 00:18:19.477
And you start channelizing this money for something better,

00:18:19.603 --> 00:18:21.947
something that gives you more joy,

00:18:22.067 --> 00:18:25.800
more happiness and of an eternal nature, not a temporary one,

00:18:25.920 --> 00:18:28.547
that you take the drink [the] previous night

00:18:28.667 --> 00:18:30.785
and in the morning you are finished!

00:18:30.905 --> 00:18:37.052
You get a drink that never finishes, which you enjoy all the time.

00:18:37.219 --> 00:18:42.138
You get drunk like that. Because in my own life I have seen,

00:18:44.589 --> 00:18:50.556
it’s such a so-called sophisticated elite life.

00:18:50.676 --> 00:18:54.476
People drink much more, you see, than normal people drink.

00:18:54.809 --> 00:18:57.886
And they ask me, “Why don’t you drink?” I say, “I am already drunk!

00:18:58.087 --> 00:19:00.269
The day I was born I was so drunk that, now,

00:19:00.389 --> 00:19:04.049
if I have to drink more I’ll fall off, so better not ask me!”

00:19:04.169 --> 00:19:06.751
They are quite frightened at my, this thing,

00:19:06.871 --> 00:19:09.906
I said, “I am really fully drunk already!”

00:19:10.041 --> 00:19:12.122
So they start looking at me!

00:19:12.242 --> 00:19:19.707
And they never find me anyway less in spirits as they are.

00:19:19.827 --> 00:19:22.689
Actually I’m always little more than they are,

00:19:22.809 --> 00:19:25.280
so they never force me to do that.

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.243
But these things drop out automatically.

00:19:29.363 --> 00:19:32.389
I don’t have to tell you that you have to drop out.

00:19:32.509 --> 00:19:34.376
Because most of the things you have done

00:19:34.496 --> 00:19:36.486
because you have been seeking something.

00:19:36.606 --> 00:19:39.895
You know, there are people, I asked them, “Why do you do this?”

00:19:40.015 --> 00:19:42.530
They said, “We are seeking love,” I said “How?

00:19:42.650 --> 00:19:45.603
How can you find love like this?” Or somebody will say that,

00:19:45.723 --> 00:19:48.503
“I am seeking God.” There are many people who are taking drugs,

00:19:48.623 --> 00:19:51.283
I mean, genuinely, just for seeking.

00:19:51.403 --> 00:19:54.239
But when they have found it, what they were seeking,

00:19:54.359 --> 00:19:58.752
they don’t take drugs. But this is one of the side issues,

00:19:58.872 --> 00:20:01.690
I was just trying to make it little lighter.

00:20:01.810 --> 00:20:07.252
But mainly what happens is that, actually the principle of Lakshmi,

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:12.065
the principle of well-being within you is awakened.

00:20:14.661 --> 00:20:19.234
And if you listen to one of my tapes where I have described

00:20:19.354 --> 00:20:23.744
what a Lakshmi is, and how She is symbolised:

00:20:23.864 --> 00:20:27.529
it’s a very beautiful picture of Lakshmi

00:20:27.902 --> 00:20:32.786
that the great seers have put before us:

00:20:32.906 --> 00:20:38.664
That, She is after all a Mother, She is a mother.

00:20:38.998 --> 00:20:46.196
A person who is a rich man has to be a motherly person.

00:20:47.271 --> 00:20:50.450
But here you find, in the whole world I have seen [that]

00:20:50.570 --> 00:20:54.182
those who have even little money their nose goes up like that

00:20:54.302 --> 00:20:58.837
and if you see them from down below they look like wolves

00:20:58.957 --> 00:21:02.198
not like mothers – most surprising.

00:21:02.698 --> 00:21:10.691
And this Lakshmi who is a Mother, wears a white sari,

00:21:12.191 --> 00:21:16.237
very elegant, with a gold border.

00:21:17.308 --> 00:21:23.420
That represents that he doesn’t put people into awe

00:21:24.460 --> 00:21:27.868
by his pomp and show and this and that.

00:21:29.923 --> 00:21:31.945
She’s standing on a lotus.

00:21:32.065 --> 00:21:36.028
Imagine any human being standing on a lotus!

00:21:38.124 --> 00:21:48.596
That means that She’s so light in Her behaviour towards others.

00:21:49.730 --> 00:21:55.157
She’s so delicate, She touches people with such delicacy,

00:21:55.277 --> 00:21:58.755
that people don’t feel hurt,

00:21:58.875 --> 00:22:07.433
they are not in any way pressurized by the riches of people.

00:22:07.822 --> 00:22:09.571
But you know it’s just the opposite,

00:22:09.691 --> 00:22:12.851
if your so-called ‘rich’ you see! Horrible!

00:22:12.971 --> 00:22:17.996
If somebody’s coming in here I would like to get out of that door.

00:22:19.028 --> 00:22:21.324
They try to pressurise because they have money.

00:22:21.444 --> 00:22:25.978
You see, if somebody starts talking big, you just find out,

00:22:26.208 --> 00:22:30.790
99% he must have won some horse race!

00:22:32.984 --> 00:22:37.801
This pressurising is a sign that he is not a lakshmipati,

00:22:37.921 --> 00:22:43.058
he has nothing to do with Lakshmi. So he’s so gracious.

00:22:46.963 --> 00:22:51.807
I have seen such people. I have seen some people like that.

00:22:52.712 --> 00:22:57.403
I have seen one in England you will be surprised to know.

00:22:58.202 --> 00:23:02.683
I have just seen him once. He was a gentleman

00:23:02.803 --> 00:23:05.392
who was some lord and something

00:23:05.512 --> 00:23:10.319
and later on he came to India and he was a Viceroy (Lord Mountbatten).

00:23:12.446 --> 00:23:16.351
And there was a gentleman who was very well known to us,

00:23:16.471 --> 00:23:21.681
he once met him in a train which was delayed or something happened

00:23:21.801 --> 00:23:24.898
and they had to get down at another station

00:23:25.018 --> 00:23:27.036
and somehow or other they were put together.

00:23:27.156 --> 00:23:31.324
And he was so simple and so good and so helpful

00:23:31.444 --> 00:23:37.475
that this gentleman was taken by him.

00:23:37.596 --> 00:23:39.872
He said, “Now better you come to my house because

00:23:39.993 --> 00:23:42.531
it’s not going to be any train, you come to my house.”

00:23:42.651 --> 00:23:44.714
When he went to his house he was surprised

00:23:44.835 --> 00:23:49.513
the house was like a palace! And then he told he who he was,

00:23:49.634 --> 00:23:55.162
and he was amazed! And he even carried his bag with him.

00:23:55.282 --> 00:23:59.834
Such a simple man. And then, when this person told me

00:23:59.954 --> 00:24:02.988
that such a person is there, then he re-visited India,

00:24:03.108 --> 00:24:04.706
then he brought him to see me.

00:24:04.826 --> 00:24:07.517
But he’s no more now he’s dead this gentleman.

00:24:07.637 --> 00:24:11.572
But he was a very big man in India and a very big person

00:24:11.692 --> 00:24:15.941
but such a simple man! Such a simple person.

00:24:17.505 --> 00:24:21.854
So that’s the significance of well-being.

00:24:21.974 --> 00:24:26.629
So when a Sahaja Yogi becomes well-being, gets well-being

00:24:27.859 --> 00:24:32.603
then he has all these qualities in him that,

00:24:32.832 --> 00:24:37.950
he doesn’t impress on others that he has a property

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:41.873
or he has got money and he should pressurise others.

00:24:41.993 --> 00:24:47.414
If he’s really a good Sahaja Yogi he would be the humblest of all

00:24:47.842 --> 00:24:51.751
and he would be very generous because in Her hand,

00:24:51.871 --> 00:24:53.953
one hand is like this.

00:24:54.358 --> 00:24:57.626
The left hand is like this, means She’s generous, She’s giving.

00:24:57.746 --> 00:25:00.530
All the time She’s giving. She’s not taking anything,

00:25:00.650 --> 00:25:05.517
She’s giving. And that’s how such a person is all the time giving.

00:25:05.637 --> 00:25:11.127
I have seen people who, after Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:11.277 --> 00:25:17.247
receive a lot of blessings and are miserly or try to oppress others,

00:25:17.367 --> 00:25:19.980
lose their properties and lose their money

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.635
and really suffer a little bit.

00:25:22.755 --> 00:25:26.464
Because otherwise there’s no way of teaching them.

00:25:27.955 --> 00:25:31.419
So the generosity flows from Her hand

00:25:31.539 --> 00:25:33.937
and another hand is like this,

00:25:34.057 --> 00:25:41.241
which means that She gives protection to people.

00:25:43.288 --> 00:25:48.198
There have to be some people who are ashritas, are dependents,

00:25:48.318 --> 00:25:52.641
who just depend, from whom such a person doesn’t take any money,

00:25:52.761 --> 00:25:58.549
they just live. These systems are still in India.

00:25:58.669 --> 00:26:03.906
Those people who are well off always have about two, three people

00:26:04.026 --> 00:26:08.672
being supported by them. Is a system still working in India,

00:26:08.792 --> 00:26:12.630
in many places. I mean, in my father’s house we always remember

00:26:12.750 --> 00:26:14.362
we had people like that.

00:26:14.482 --> 00:26:18.072
They were educated and given higher education by my father free,

00:26:18.192 --> 00:26:22.543
just free. But never did they feel that they were anybody else,

00:26:22.663 --> 00:26:27.120
treated with same respect and with same dignity as we were treated.

00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:31.204
But that was a part of life, one had to do it.

00:26:31.672 --> 00:26:33.174
This is the ashraya,

00:26:33.294 --> 00:26:36.298
is that there should be some people depending on you.

00:26:36.418 --> 00:26:39.841
England also I’ve seen people have cats, dogs, things like that, you see,

00:26:39.961 --> 00:26:43.740
little bit they do spend on cats and dogs.

00:26:45.383 --> 00:26:47.328
But better to spend on human beings.

00:26:47.449 --> 00:26:49.448
What am I going to do with cats and dogs?

00:26:49.569 --> 00:26:51.794
Can I give them realization? (laughter)

00:26:54.823 --> 00:26:57.162
It’s better to look after human beings

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.932
than to look after cats and dogs so much!

00:27:00.053 --> 00:27:02.930
But I have seen that when they are dealing with cats and dogs

00:27:03.051 --> 00:27:04.273
they are very happy people,

00:27:04.393 --> 00:27:07.454
but with human beings they are very unhappy, I don’t know why.

00:27:07.574 --> 00:27:09.929
If you must have seen in the BBC and all that,

00:27:10.049 --> 00:27:13.384
when they have these advertisements I have seen in television sometimes,

00:27:13.504 --> 00:27:18.007
you see a person having a cat, she’ll always smile and joke and this.

00:27:18.127 --> 00:27:22.332
And anybody having children, she looks so miserable! (laughter)

00:27:26.713 --> 00:27:31.876
That should not be so. There should be somebody dependent.

00:27:32.241 --> 00:27:36.957
It’s not important to measure every money, to ask for 2p (£0.02)

00:27:37.077 --> 00:27:40.988
– “I gave you yesterday, will you return 2p to me?”

00:27:41.108 --> 00:27:45.058
It doesn’t behove a Sahaja Yogi to be like that.

00:27:45.614 --> 00:27:50.393
If it comes to that, alright, give some money – forget about it.

00:27:50.513 --> 00:27:53.952
It helps you such a lot, it helps you such a lot.

00:27:54.072 --> 00:27:59.371
To be meticulously so observant about how much money you lent

00:27:59.576 --> 00:28:03.557
it’s better to be more worried about how much you have taken

00:28:03.677 --> 00:28:07.672
than to be how much you have given. It helps a lot.

00:28:08.244 --> 00:28:13.116
It’s a thing one has to realize in life, how much it helps.

00:28:14.132 --> 00:28:19.456
I have seen in my own life it has helped so many times.

00:28:20.089 --> 00:28:24.555
I mean you really have people then, around you.

00:28:24.746 --> 00:28:28.049
It’s a matter of 5 Rupees and 10 Rupees.

00:28:28.169 --> 00:28:32.129
It’s so important then to some people at a [certain] point,

00:28:32.249 --> 00:28:34.998
and it works wonders!

00:28:36.243 --> 00:28:43.517
I mean, you can have a human worth millions by paying sometimes 5 Rupees,

00:28:43.637 --> 00:28:47.215
it can work out that way. So try to be more giving

00:28:47.335 --> 00:28:49.750
and then you receive more as a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:49.870 --> 00:28:54.912
Remember that now you are connected with Lakshmi.

00:28:55.992 --> 00:28:59.536
The more generous you are the more you get it.

00:28:59.656 --> 00:29:04.325
When you are small-minded you do no receive Her blessings.

00:29:04.445 --> 00:29:07.450
You have to give, you have to give.

00:29:07.570 --> 00:29:12.412
Once you give, it starts flowing, the stagnation is over

00:29:12.532 --> 00:29:14.465
and the flow starts coming in.

00:29:14.585 --> 00:29:17.484
Otherwise you are stagnated when your hand is, you see,

00:29:17.604 --> 00:29:20.145
tight fisted as you call it.

00:29:20.391 --> 00:29:24.039
English language has so many good words,

00:29:24.278 --> 00:29:27.581
though they are now losing their meaning!

00:29:27.701 --> 00:29:32.643
They call it you are very, I don’t know there must be some new words

00:29:32.763 --> 00:29:35.495
for being very, very miserly, some good word, you know,

00:29:35.615 --> 00:29:39.308
which doesn’t mean miserly but must be some ‘economical’

00:29:39.428 --> 00:29:45.503
or something fantastic. But actually miserliness, is miserliness,

00:29:45.623 --> 00:29:48.619
give it whatever name you like, it’s horrible.

00:29:48.739 --> 00:29:51.606
And one should not take to miserliness,

00:29:51.726 --> 00:29:55.246
that is a curse I tell you, it’s a disease,

00:29:55.366 --> 00:30:03.365
it’s like leprosy, to be hated. Try to be generous.

00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:12.644
Now the generosity of maybe, I don’t know, but maybe of money,

00:30:12.946 --> 00:30:15.441
is not difficult for some people.

00:30:15.561 --> 00:30:20.850
But generosity of saying something good to others is rare.

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:25.680
You see somebody in a good dress,

00:30:25.800 --> 00:30:27.644
you should be generous enough to say,

00:30:27.764 --> 00:30:32.258
“Oh, it’s fantastic, it’s beautiful.” What’s wrong?

00:30:32.378 --> 00:30:38.339
But jealousy, that goes against Lakshmi completely.

00:30:38.926 --> 00:30:40.995
It’s better that others are wearing it;

00:30:41.115 --> 00:30:44.699
you don’t pay for it and you enjoy it! (laughter)

00:30:45.091 --> 00:30:49.098
It’s very logical you just see.

00:30:49.318 --> 00:30:53.896
You see, if you own this hall, it will be a headache for you isn’t it,

00:30:54.016 --> 00:30:57.400
to keep it alright. I mean imagine the people who own it,

00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.371
and to put it right because everybody will come and criticise,

00:31:00.491 --> 00:31:02.216
“This is not good, that’s not good.”

00:31:02.337 --> 00:31:06.949
But it’s nice to be here, when it doesn’t belong to you, to enjoy it.

00:31:07.902 --> 00:31:12.734
It’s very simple. Just try to enjoy it, to be generous with people,

00:31:12.854 --> 00:31:18.293
be kind to them. This generosity is lacking.

00:31:18.936 --> 00:31:24.696
When this starts, then the inner core of emotional being starts

00:31:24.816 --> 00:31:26.771
getting enlightened.

00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:31.823
Go to the subtler side of material well-being

00:31:31.943 --> 00:31:35.712
and you start getting into emotional thing.

00:31:36.514 --> 00:31:41.130
Small, small things work out, very small.

00:31:42.386 --> 00:31:44.305
It’s very sweet.

00:31:45.797 --> 00:31:51.317
We have so many examples of this kind of little sweetness

00:31:52.229 --> 00:31:54.301
being expressed.

00:31:56.078 --> 00:32:01.468
And this generosity should come to all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:32:02.778 --> 00:32:04.336
of saying good things to others.

00:32:04.456 --> 00:32:08.634
Doesn’t matter [that] it is exaggeration, doesn’t matter,

00:32:10.680 --> 00:32:14.605
because it acts as a buffer.

00:32:15.405 --> 00:32:17.951
Then the fright of the strangers,

00:32:18.071 --> 00:32:22.212
fright of the neighbours, fright of other human beings, you know.

00:32:22.332 --> 00:32:24.741
Every human being has become now [that] he sees

00:32:24.861 --> 00:32:27.929
another human being coming, he recoils back. Imagine!

00:32:28.049 --> 00:32:31.406
First, I mean, say about fifty years back it was like dogs;

00:32:31.526 --> 00:32:35.146
if any human being saw another human being they used to bark!

00:32:35.266 --> 00:32:41.446
Now it is another way round. So, the fear of your brother,

00:32:41.566 --> 00:32:47.436
of your own kin and kith, of your part and parcel.

00:32:47.998 --> 00:32:51.836
They are your own, you don’t know, they are part and parcel of your being,

00:32:51.956 --> 00:32:54.532
you can feel it, after Sahaja Yoga you can feel it,

00:32:54.652 --> 00:32:56.509
I don’t have to tell you.

00:32:57.208 --> 00:33:01.641
You can feel them within yourself, they are within you.

00:33:02.077 --> 00:33:08.267
And then the sweetness of saying something sweet,

00:33:09.656 --> 00:33:16.195
of saying something sweet, is so nice,

00:33:16.315 --> 00:33:22.124
is so rewarding, itself, itself, so rewarding.

00:33:22.338 --> 00:33:26.662
The movement of Shakti is always this way.

00:33:26.932 --> 00:33:30.283
If I give you love, love comes back to me.

00:33:30.403 --> 00:33:33.691
If I give you hatred, hatred comes back to me.

00:33:33.811 --> 00:33:38.863
And double fold everything. If I give you love,

00:33:38.983 --> 00:33:42.010
say 1 unit, I may get 7 units of love.

00:33:42.130 --> 00:33:45.833
But if I give you hatred of 1, that too,

00:33:45.953 --> 00:33:48.666
7 units of hatred comes to you.

00:33:48.786 --> 00:33:51.655
The mathematics is complete.

00:33:52.218 --> 00:33:57.155
So try to understand that, emotionally,

00:33:57.781 --> 00:34:01.554
you have to understand your material well-being.

00:34:01.674 --> 00:34:06.480
How to express emotionally your material well-being

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:08.706
is a very sweet thing.

00:34:10.388 --> 00:34:12.567
I would give you an example of Gavin

00:34:12.687 --> 00:34:16.682
because I can’t forget that very sweet incident:

00:34:17.285 --> 00:34:21.749
One day we had called some people, you see,

00:34:21.869 --> 00:34:24.596
I didn’t know there would be so many coming, in his house.

00:34:24.716 --> 00:34:28.641
And he has a house but, I mean, not so big like this.

00:34:28.761 --> 00:34:31.818
So there were about fifty people, around. And I told him,

00:34:31.938 --> 00:34:35.867
“Prepare some food for them.” But I thought for fifty people

00:34:35.987 --> 00:34:38.754
he could not have prepared, at the most for ten people!

00:34:38.874 --> 00:34:42.397
So I was quite embarrassed  and I was waiting for people to go away,

00:34:42.518 --> 00:34:45.610
I didn’t say, “Stay on for dinner,” or anything, I thought,

00:34:45.731 --> 00:34:48.947
“Poor Gavin, how could he have cooked for fifty people?”

00:34:49.068 --> 00:34:51.988
And when they disappeared, about five, six were remained.

00:34:52.109 --> 00:34:55.320
I said, “Now let’s have dinner!” He was very unhappy

00:34:55.441 --> 00:34:58.153
and he was looking this side and that side,

00:34:58.273 --> 00:35:00.761
I said, “What happened?” But he didn’t say anything.

00:35:00.881 --> 00:35:03.827
So I slept that night in his house. Next morning I got up –

00:35:03.947 --> 00:35:07.838
still he was very uneasy. Next day I said,

00:35:07.958 --> 00:35:10.222
“What’s the matter? What’s playing on your mind?”

00:35:10.342 --> 00:35:12.931
He said, “Mother why did you ask all of them to go away?

00:35:13.052 --> 00:35:15.106
I had prepared [dinner] for fifty of them?”

00:35:15.227 --> 00:35:17.896
This filled me with such joy you can’t imagine!

00:35:18.017 --> 00:35:20.000
Tremendous joy,

00:35:22.878 --> 00:35:24.059
tremendous joy.

00:35:24.179 --> 00:35:27.488
I mean, that I cannot get over such things you know.

00:35:27.609 --> 00:35:30.185
And I have just seen so many Sahaja Yogis like that,

00:35:30.306 --> 00:35:32.621
very very sweet persons. Another is Gregoire,

00:35:32.741 --> 00:35:37.840
another very sweetie person, you know, the way he does things for others.

00:35:38.721 --> 00:35:43.210
Sometimes the way he works it out is so sweet,

00:35:43.980 --> 00:35:49.878
and how he really knows how to express himself sweetly

00:35:49.998 --> 00:35:52.048
in small, little things.

00:35:53.103 --> 00:35:59.765
It’s so surprising, how people are very beautiful

00:35:59.885 --> 00:36:05.348
and how they are working out these material things

00:36:05.468 --> 00:36:07.809
to express their emotions.

00:36:07.929 --> 00:36:11.195
Material is for emotions only, you see.

00:36:11.315 --> 00:36:14.650
My mother had a principal that, if she had six sarees,

00:36:14.770 --> 00:36:16.834
the seventh one she’ll present out.

00:36:16.954 --> 00:36:20.703
She had kept six; not more [are] needed, you see.

00:36:20.823 --> 00:36:23.389
And she was a woman of great principle, I must say,

00:36:23.509 --> 00:36:27.583
because she used to spin her own sarees. Can you imagine!

00:36:28.329 --> 00:36:31.159
And that’s what she used to wear, herself.

00:36:31.279 --> 00:36:33.420
And she was a wife of a very rich man, I mean,

00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.229
she had no problem of money but this was her principle,

00:36:36.350 --> 00:36:38.843
she used to live like that. And she said that,

00:36:38.963 --> 00:36:42.051
“What? I need six, more than [that] I don’t need,”

00:36:42.171 --> 00:36:44.863
because it’s cotton sarees, you see, so

00:36:44.983 --> 00:36:48.459
one saree you wash and next you wear and you can just press it.

00:36:48.580 --> 00:36:51.410
We had people in the house who could do that for her.

00:36:51.530 --> 00:36:53.891
She said, “There’s no need to have more than six.”

00:36:54.011 --> 00:36:57.091
And one she would keep for some occasion, you see, expensive one,

00:36:57.211 --> 00:37:00.013
if she has to go for a wedding and all that, that’s all.

00:37:00.133 --> 00:37:03.369
So the seventh was kept (to give away) and out of the six,

00:37:03.489 --> 00:37:06.260
if she got one more she would donate that to somebody.

00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:11.098
She would only keep up to six you see, that was her principle,

00:37:11.218 --> 00:37:15.354
and she managed her life very well.

00:37:15.474 --> 00:37:22.308
And I was also bit too much of a generous person

00:37:22.482 --> 00:37:27.595
and she always supported my generosity, always she supported it.

00:37:27.715 --> 00:37:30.984
And she was very happy when she found that I would just give away

00:37:31.105 --> 00:37:34.099
lots of things to people who came to my house and she would say,

00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:36.276
“Oh that’s very good, she should do that.”

00:37:36.397 --> 00:37:38.596
Everybody used to say that, “That should be done”.

00:37:38.716 --> 00:37:41.383
Always used to encourage me for such things that I did.

00:37:41.503 --> 00:37:43.735
But I found [that] all things have only value

00:37:43.855 --> 00:37:47.302
if I can give them away otherwise they have no value.

00:37:47.422 --> 00:37:50.331
And I keep only the things that are being presented to me

00:37:50.451 --> 00:37:53.795
all the rest pass out of my hands very easily into people.

00:37:53.916 --> 00:37:56.698
Anybody who says, “I like this,” “Alright, have it!”

00:37:56.819 --> 00:38:00.104
You see, I feel so happy to give it to them and it’s really rewarding.

00:38:00.225 --> 00:38:02.707
Now that person thinks, “What should I give you back?”

00:38:02.828 --> 00:38:04.792
I said, “Now please! That’s not to be done

00:38:04.913 --> 00:38:07.690
because you know already, come and see, this house is filled

00:38:07.811 --> 00:38:10.442
with things, and I don’t know how to get rid of them.”

00:38:10.563 --> 00:38:14.301
If I buy anything myself, of course I don’t earn anything

00:38:14.421 --> 00:38:20.203
so it’s from my husband’s money, I try to give it away.

00:38:20.489 --> 00:38:23.606
It’s very nice, it’s really extremely nice.

00:38:23.726 --> 00:38:26.279
After all what’s the use of these things in the house?

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.539
What are you going to do [with them]?

00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.703
I mean, if you have to have a personal archives, you can have!

00:38:32.823 --> 00:38:35.908
You see, something like that, putting up this thing bought there,

00:38:36.029 --> 00:38:39.844
this thing bought there. But normally what do you do?

00:38:40.502 --> 00:38:44.985
So this kind of a generosity is to be developed within us.

00:38:45.105 --> 00:38:53.278
The aesthetics of generosity is to be seen.

00:38:53.993 --> 00:38:59.301
How you give things to others and how you express your emotional being.

00:38:59.421 --> 00:39:04.379
For people who are emotionally dry because of ego orientation,

00:39:04.499 --> 00:39:08.596
should learn these things, is very important.

00:39:08.716 --> 00:39:12.789
That will give them some emotional side also.

00:39:12.909 --> 00:39:15.581
[It’s] very much necessary for people

00:39:15.701 --> 00:39:20.152
who do not feel their feelings much, their joy much;

00:39:20.272 --> 00:39:24.930
they should try to do it [then] they will start feeling it much more.

00:39:25.050 --> 00:39:29.165
Then the emotional side is enlightened within us,

00:39:31.443 --> 00:39:35.267
the Grace starts flowing up to emotional side.

00:39:36.243 --> 00:39:40.541
In emotional side, first of all the purification takes place.

00:39:40.661 --> 00:39:42.654
That’s very important.

00:39:42.821 --> 00:39:45.404
To lead a very beautiful emotional life

00:39:45.524 --> 00:39:48.580
you must have pure ideas,

00:39:48.929 --> 00:39:52.363
otherwise you can never be emotionally alright.

00:39:52.483 --> 00:39:55.154
You see, like in a tree you have to have leaves

00:39:55.274 --> 00:39:58.617
you have to have roots, you have to have fruits,

00:39:58.737 --> 00:40:02.452
you have to have flowers at it’s proper places.

00:40:02.572 --> 00:40:05.647
Like in your house you have to have a drawing room,

00:40:05.767 --> 00:40:09.189
you have to have a bedroom, you have to have a bathroom;

00:40:09.309 --> 00:40:13.596
everything separated. You do not put them into a complete,

00:40:13.716 --> 00:40:19.491
what do you call that? A mixer.

00:40:19.626 --> 00:40:22.131
You do not make it like that, isn’t it?

00:40:22.251 --> 00:40:25.388
You don’t put your bathroom in the drawing rooms do you?

00:40:25.508 --> 00:40:28.482
I mean some people may start it with the kind of confusion

00:40:28.602 --> 00:40:31.855
they have these days! But normally you do not do it.

00:40:31.975 --> 00:40:38.974
In our own emotional life we must have pure sense.

00:40:39.116 --> 00:40:45.213
Purity of a sisterly love, purity of a brotherly love,

00:40:45.563 --> 00:40:47.327
purity of a wife’s love.

00:40:47.447 --> 00:40:53.013
For example infidelity: infidelity is impurity,

00:40:53.133 --> 00:40:56.678
infidelity comes when there is impurity.

00:40:56.900 --> 00:41:00.402
Without fidelity the marriage life cannot be happy.

00:41:00.522 --> 00:41:02.477
That’s the basis of married life.

00:41:02.597 --> 00:41:07.895
You see, “I like…”  this “I like” business is impurity.

00:41:08.015 --> 00:41:11.343
The impurity in you likes it.

00:41:12.025 --> 00:41:14.852
Gradually, after realisation, you start developing

00:41:14.972 --> 00:41:17.304
that purity within you;

00:41:18.812 --> 00:41:23.420
you start understanding these are your brothers and sisters.

00:41:24.444 --> 00:41:28.402
As soon as your emotional life starts improving

00:41:29.061 --> 00:41:31.404
your innocence starts awakening up.

00:41:31.524 --> 00:41:35.455
You see? It is connected with your innocence.

00:41:35.575 --> 00:41:39.287
The left side is connected with your innocence.

00:41:39.564 --> 00:41:45.307
And then it starts flowering and you really become innocent.

00:41:45.481 --> 00:41:50.016
Now see the practical side: you go to somebody’s house,

00:41:50.136 --> 00:41:54.157
the gentleman has a beautiful wife, now your bad eyes on the wife,

00:41:54.277 --> 00:41:57.916
how can you enjoy? You cannot enjoy, the husband cannot enjoy,

00:41:58.036 --> 00:42:01.743
the wife cannot enjoy, all the time there’s a fear.

00:42:01.863 --> 00:42:05.265
Maybe the wife may run away with you or something may happen:

00:42:05.385 --> 00:42:08.839
the whole house will be finished, I mean, you are so destructive!

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:12.247
So-called ‘charming’ men and ‘charming’ women

00:42:12.367 --> 00:42:14.343
are just destroying each others lives.

00:42:14.463 --> 00:42:17.971
Where do they land? All in the orphanages!

00:42:18.091 --> 00:42:21.549
A woman marries seven times, a husband marries eight times.

00:42:21.669 --> 00:42:24.185
All these old people are in the orphanage

00:42:24.305 --> 00:42:26.566
and children are in another orphanage.

00:42:26.686 --> 00:42:30.419
You see, you are just creating orphanages by this kind of impurity

00:42:30.539 --> 00:42:33.421
in your mind. But by telling you, these things,

00:42:33.541 --> 00:42:36.956
you are not going to believe me, nor you can do it,

00:42:37.076 --> 00:42:39.667
but just when it happens.

00:42:40.024 --> 00:42:45.211
When this happens, the innocence, the joy of pure love,

00:42:45.331 --> 00:42:51.775
when there is no other impurity but just pure love

00:42:51.895 --> 00:42:55.219
for brothers, sisters. I mean, here,

00:42:55.339 --> 00:43:00.721
I have seen people don’t even sort of embrace each other– men.

00:43:00.841 --> 00:43:02.636
It’s most surprising,

00:43:02.756 --> 00:43:05.950
I mean, for us it’s something one can’t understand.

00:43:06.070 --> 00:43:09.055
So much impurity has gone into our brain that every man,

00:43:09.175 --> 00:43:10.603
is he that way wrong?

00:43:10.724 --> 00:43:13.256
When we came here my husband used to embrace every man;

00:43:13.377 --> 00:43:15.744
I told him, “Don’t do it, people will laugh at you!”

00:43:15.865 --> 00:43:16.983
He said, “Really?”

00:43:17.103 --> 00:43:19.830
He said, “But everyone is not like that, maybe one person.”

00:43:19.950 --> 00:43:22.499
I said, “No, they think everybody is like that.”

00:43:22.619 --> 00:43:25.408
You see, whatever they found pathological in one person,

00:43:25.528 --> 00:43:27.383
they think everybody is like that.

00:43:27.503 --> 00:43:33.097
These psychologists, whatever they read in one abnormal person,

00:43:33.217 --> 00:43:36.560
they try to see in everyone! Everybody is not like that!

00:43:36.680 --> 00:43:40.272
I mean there is no harm in understanding

00:43:40.392 --> 00:43:44.313
that there is only 1% people are pathological

00:43:44.433 --> 00:43:47.237
-who go to these psychologists!

00:43:47.357 --> 00:43:50.751
The others who are spoilt are because of psychologists themselves!

00:43:50.871 --> 00:43:53.975
They put ideas, “You have a guilt, you have a guilt, you have a guilt.”

00:43:54.096 --> 00:43:57.154
Even if you don’t have, you will have it! (laughter)

00:43:58.773 --> 00:44:01.745
They go on putting ideas into your heads.

00:44:01.865 --> 00:44:04.487
All this is supposed to be intellectual expansion,

00:44:04.607 --> 00:44:07.012
whatever you may call it, it’s all nonsense you see.

00:44:07.132 --> 00:44:09.189
A person who doesn’t commit sin you say,

00:44:09.310 --> 00:44:10.832
“Oh, he must have committed sin,”

00:44:10.953 --> 00:44:12.983
now he doesn’t know what to do he’ll come and say,

00:44:13.104 --> 00:44:15.370
“Alright baba, I have committed sin, now I have to confess.

00:44:15.491 --> 00:44:17.506
So I have to confess, yes I have committed sin.”

00:44:17.626 --> 00:44:19.532
They play about like this.

00:44:19.652 --> 00:44:21.675
They just try to build you up and all that

00:44:21.796 --> 00:44:24.762
and then they break you, shatter you completely and then you think,

00:44:24.883 --> 00:44:28.700
“Oh I am the most sinful person [who] ever lived!”

00:44:30.565 --> 00:44:31.934
If you were that sinful,

00:44:32.054 --> 00:44:35.713
do you think you will get realisation first of all?

00:44:38.524 --> 00:44:42.897
First ask yourself the question, “How did I get realisation?

00:44:43.017 --> 00:44:44.742
How did I feel vibrations?

00:44:44.862 --> 00:44:48.047
If I was that sinful, how could I get it?”

00:44:48.643 --> 00:44:51.309
Throw away all these ideas of these psychologists

00:44:51.429 --> 00:44:53.589
and tell them that we don’t believe you!

00:44:53.709 --> 00:44:57.784
You see, this is very few people who are really basically sinful.

00:44:57.904 --> 00:45:03.057
I tell you, very, very rarely, I have not seen anyone so far,

00:45:03.177 --> 00:45:05.810
except for these horrible gurus who are well known!

00:45:05.930 --> 00:45:08.962
After all they are the people who are rakshasas,

00:45:09.082 --> 00:45:12.561
they are not human beings, you see, so that’s a different category.

00:45:12.681 --> 00:45:15.327
But, otherwise, I have not seen basically a person

00:45:15.447 --> 00:45:21.053
who has nothing good in him. Because everybody has the Spirit.

00:45:21.450 --> 00:45:24.900
And definitely Spirit is superior much more dynamic

00:45:25.020 --> 00:45:26.623
than all the sins put together.

00:45:26.744 --> 00:45:30.870
What are these little, little sins here and there? What are you doing?

00:45:30.990 --> 00:45:33.692
And there’s nothing to feel so diffident about it.

00:45:33.812 --> 00:45:37.235
After all you are realised people, you are saints.

00:45:37.355 --> 00:45:39.668
You are to be respected.

00:45:40.415 --> 00:45:43.808
You have to respect yourself first of all.

00:45:44.149 --> 00:45:47.629
You are all saints, do you realise that?

00:45:48.137 --> 00:45:52.062
Once you realise you are saints you will start acting as saints,

00:45:52.182 --> 00:45:54.158
how the saints act.

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.698
You will put yourself onto that pedestal of understanding

00:45:57.819 --> 00:46:00.758
that you are really saints, otherwise you won’t get vibrations.

00:46:00.879 --> 00:46:02.465
Go and ask anyone of these!

00:46:02.586 --> 00:46:06.723
They will tell you: the vibrations, only people who are saints get it.

00:46:06.844 --> 00:46:11.499
In India all the people are burnt when they die;

00:46:11.619 --> 00:46:15.112
not the saints, realised souls are not,

00:46:17.678 --> 00:46:19.689
they are respected.

00:46:20.213 --> 00:46:22.263
They say when the saints come to your house,

00:46:22.383 --> 00:46:25.744
that’s the day, is the day of festival.

00:46:27.197 --> 00:46:34.332
And all of you are that so don’t think that you cannot do this,

00:46:34.452 --> 00:46:36.962
and you have this guilt and you have these things –

00:46:37.082 --> 00:46:40.612
nothing of the kind! You are pure Spirit.

00:46:42.784 --> 00:46:45.914
Be very lavish about it!

00:46:46.906 --> 00:46:52.876
Of course, I mean, too much indulgences into these things,

00:46:53.154 --> 00:46:58.394
emotional life also, can lead you to a stagnation point.

00:46:58.514 --> 00:47:03.863
Like I hear people saying that, “There’s a lot of love between us.”

00:47:05.173 --> 00:47:09.335
But one has to be discreet in that also:

00:47:09.455 --> 00:47:15.341
does it make you universal or it makes you localised?

00:47:15.461 --> 00:47:20.752
You see, like Britishers for British, Indians for Indians, finished!

00:47:21.284 --> 00:47:27.362
If that love makes you universal, by which you say kindly things,

00:47:30.386 --> 00:47:37.478
by which you enjoy the love of other people, their vibrations.

00:47:37.598 --> 00:47:42.778
Whatever creed, race, it is, whatever part of the world they come from,

00:47:42.898 --> 00:47:45.552
they are Sahaja Yogis; if you start enjoying them,

00:47:45.672 --> 00:47:49.355
then know that that is love.

00:47:50.021 --> 00:47:53.302
It should not be localised in any way.

00:47:53.676 --> 00:47:59.207
If there is any group forming, then must know that it is not love,

00:47:59.327 --> 00:48:04.105
it’s not Divinity, it’s not.

00:48:04.225 --> 00:48:10.504
Divinity is universal, it embraces everything, everything.

00:48:10.624 --> 00:48:14.442
It has no discrimination of any kind.

00:48:14.562 --> 00:48:20.046
It only discriminates between evil and good,

00:48:20.395 --> 00:48:23.943
unrighteous and righteous,

00:48:24.063 --> 00:48:27.553
Christ and anti-Christ,

00:48:27.673 --> 00:48:30.673
God and anti-God

00:48:32.165 --> 00:48:36.025
but it does not discriminate on these three levels

00:48:36.145 --> 00:48:43.180
that is physical appearances, mental approach

00:48:43.300 --> 00:48:48.463
or mental development or emotional expressions.

00:48:48.583 --> 00:48:50.834
Some people are emotionally very expressive.

00:48:50.954 --> 00:48:54.980
I would say English are less expressive by temperament maybe,

00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:58.726
that’s their temperament. Indians are extremely expressive.

00:48:58.847 --> 00:49:00.702
If you go to India, to a village, say,

00:49:00.822 --> 00:49:04.428
you go to Rahuri (Maharashtra), they will just take you

00:49:04.571 --> 00:49:09.846
in their embrace and would start weeping and crying with joy.

00:49:09.966 --> 00:49:13.479
I mean, you will be amazed the way they will love you, I mean, imagine!

00:49:13.600 --> 00:49:18.188
And for them it would be like, they wouldn’t mind

00:49:18.308 --> 00:49:22.120
even if they have to spread themselves on the ground

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:25.178
for you to walk smoothly

00:49:25.298 --> 00:49:31.144
so that you don’t feel the horrible roads of India.

00:49:31.264 --> 00:49:33.362
That kind of tremendous emotions,

00:49:33.482 --> 00:49:36.444
the expression you will be surprised.

00:49:36.564 --> 00:49:38.759
You will be overwhelmed and sometimes shocked,

00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.935
you know, the way they are.

00:49:42.847 --> 00:49:45.465
But that doesn’t mean that English don’t love.

00:49:45.585 --> 00:49:50.231
They love in their own way; they understand that.

00:49:51.548 --> 00:49:54.905
So that’s how it should be that it is all embracing,

00:49:55.025 --> 00:49:59.344
all shades, all types, all permutations, combinations.

00:49:59.464 --> 00:50:03.506
Because this variety is created by God to create beauty

00:50:03.626 --> 00:50:05.430
and all the varieties must be accepted.

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.986
Imagine you all looking just the same,

00:50:08.106 --> 00:50:12.395
how would it look? Horrible and boring!

00:50:12.601 --> 00:50:16.505
Every leaf is different, then what about human beings?

00:50:16.625 --> 00:50:19.617
But in that difference there’s the unity of Spirit

00:50:19.737 --> 00:50:22.025
and if you can feel that unity

00:50:22.145 --> 00:50:27.967
then you are emotionally absolutely correct and you are a realised soul.

00:50:29.737 --> 00:50:34.953
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

00:50:35.405 --> 00:50:39.146
Spirit that resides in your heart.

00:50:39.535 --> 00:50:45.683
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

00:50:45.803 --> 00:50:50.364
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

00:50:50.815 --> 00:50:57.965
Spirit is the one which is the diamond

00:50:59.521 --> 00:51:03.054
which shines on this beautiful ring of your body,

00:51:03.174 --> 00:51:08.890
mind and your emotions. That’s the most important thing.

00:51:09.010 --> 00:51:16.653
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

00:51:17.690 --> 00:51:21.812
That state should be achieved by all of you.

00:51:21.932 --> 00:51:26.622
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

00:51:26.742 --> 00:51:33.543
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

00:51:34.885 --> 00:51:39.580
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:43.457
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

00:51:44.203 --> 00:51:48.013
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

00:51:48.250 --> 00:51:51.210
I mean, I have to control myself;

00:51:51.330 --> 00:51:54.833
the love just shoots off from the being

00:51:54.953 --> 00:52:01.263
and just I want to give it but I wonder

00:52:01.383 --> 00:52:04.288
whether you’ll be able to bear it,

00:52:07.032 --> 00:52:09.232
so I have to control it a little bit [because]

00:52:09.352 --> 00:52:12.337
that flood may not be borne.

00:52:12.457 --> 00:52:17.890
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

00:52:18.010 --> 00:52:22.490
And the more you enrich it, the more you make it strong,

00:52:22.610 --> 00:52:25.360
the more it will shine.

00:52:25.519 --> 00:52:33.297
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand that Spirit is love,

00:52:34.741 --> 00:52:39.257
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

00:52:39.377 --> 00:52:42.681
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

00:52:42.801 --> 00:52:47.577
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

00:52:48.093 --> 00:52:55.224
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

00:52:55.344 --> 00:52:59.334
the inside starts shining by itself.

00:53:00.731 --> 00:53:05.271
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

00:53:05.771 --> 00:53:10.242
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving to the Spirit.

00:53:10.362 --> 00:53:13.857
You can’t imagine. Try them!

00:53:14.563 --> 00:53:16.160
You will enjoy yourself.

00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:18.862
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

00:53:18.982 --> 00:53:21.413
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

00:53:21.533 --> 00:53:24.216
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

00:53:24.336 --> 00:53:27.227
because I can enjoy myself there better!

00:53:27.347 --> 00:53:30.311
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself

00:53:30.431 --> 00:53:34.568
so much when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

00:53:34.688 --> 00:53:40.061
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:53:40.663 --> 00:53:43.819
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:53:43.939 --> 00:53:48.259
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

00:53:48.379 --> 00:53:52.000
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

00:53:52.120 --> 00:53:57.225
Sometimes you come down, you start criticising others.

00:53:57.345 --> 00:53:59.820
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.377
somebody filthy, dirty, something like that.

00:54:02.497 --> 00:54:04.504
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

00:54:04.625 --> 00:54:07.155
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

00:54:07.276 --> 00:54:10.464
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

00:54:10.584 --> 00:54:13.809
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

00:54:14.610 --> 00:54:17.322
But instead of that if you start criticising that person,

00:54:17.443 --> 00:54:19.283
you also become filthy in your language,

00:54:19.404 --> 00:54:22.310
filthy in your mind and everything, so why [do it]? Leave it!

00:54:22.430 --> 00:54:24.058
Let that person improve by himself,

00:54:24.178 --> 00:54:26.698
to see that he has to be clean, he has to be neat,

00:54:26.818 --> 00:54:29.048
he has to be sensible.

00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:33.714
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

00:54:33.834 --> 00:54:36.429
Where is your attention?

00:54:37.912 --> 00:54:40.800
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will ask the children

00:54:40.921 --> 00:54:43.203
when they are standing, “Where is your attention?”

00:54:43.324 --> 00:54:46.496
“Where is my attention?” alright. Then again he’s standing there,

00:54:46.617 --> 00:54:49.539
“Where is your attention?” Again he’ll be on the watch [out],

00:54:49.659 --> 00:54:51.415
“Where is my attention gone?”

00:54:51.535 --> 00:54:53.919
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

00:54:54.039 --> 00:54:59.741
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

00:54:59.884 --> 00:55:03.465
Next time I’ll tell you more about the Spirit part.

00:55:03.585 --> 00:55:06.095
I hope you have understood how necessary it is

00:55:06.215 --> 00:55:10.209
to develop your inner being.

00:55:10.804 --> 00:55:16.248
In your mental being, egoistical nature is to be controlled very much.

00:55:16.368 --> 00:55:21.611
I have seen people who go from left to right, they become egoistical.

00:55:22.285 --> 00:55:27.156
Those who go from right to left, they become frightened.

00:55:27.799 --> 00:55:34.712
All these side movements must be brought to the centre.

00:55:36.029 --> 00:55:41.625
You have to understand that from basics we have to rise higher.

00:55:41.745 --> 00:55:46.774
People have explanation for everything! No explanation is needed.

00:55:46.895 --> 00:55:49.562
Whom are you explaining? You are explaining to yourself,

00:55:49.682 --> 00:55:53.240
you are judging yourself. You have to judge yourself,

00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:56.727
[to] whom are you explaining? Mataji?

00:55:56.967 --> 00:55:59.436
She doesn’t need any explanation.

00:55:59.556 --> 00:56:03.454
I know, perhaps, everything, perhaps.

00:56:04.223 --> 00:56:06.128
But I don’t condemn you and in any way

00:56:06.249 --> 00:56:09.285
I do not want that you should be condemned by any chance at all,

00:56:09.406 --> 00:56:11.446
why should I? You are all saints after all.

00:56:11.567 --> 00:56:15.334
For me it’s the greatest satisfaction.

00:56:15.454 --> 00:56:21.180
But for your own growth I want you to understand

00:56:21.591 --> 00:56:24.240
that you are saints and you have to come up to that point.

00:56:24.360 --> 00:56:27.485
Saints have to be self-disciplined, nobody has to tell them.

00:56:27.605 --> 00:56:30.050
Discipline yourself,

00:56:31.550 --> 00:56:34.675
tell yourself, “I am a saint now.”

00:56:34.795 --> 00:56:39.671
What an opportunity it is to grow! What an opportunity!

00:56:40.242 --> 00:56:42.714
And people are only going to believe in you

00:56:42.834 --> 00:56:48.950
when you are really the saint within and saint without.

00:56:49.432 --> 00:56:52.097
In Sahaja Yoga, people become saints within

00:56:52.217 --> 00:56:54.022
and not saints without easily.

00:56:54.142 --> 00:56:57.142
But in other systems they are first made outside, you see,

00:56:57.262 --> 00:57:02.566
they are made to work for 25 years just washing the temple – finished!

00:57:03.145 --> 00:57:05.978
Then they are made to do something else for 25 years.

00:57:06.099 --> 00:57:08.501
By the time they are about to [be] dead they’ll say,

00:57:08.622 --> 00:57:12.735
“Alright, next time we’ll give you realisation.”

00:57:12.856 --> 00:57:18.693
It’s like that. But here, from inside you have really achieved

00:57:19.424 --> 00:57:24.161
your realisation no doubt, and you have greater chances of improving.

00:57:24.281 --> 00:57:26.529
This is what I thought, that,

00:57:26.649 --> 00:57:29.913
“This lifetime I am just going to give realisation

00:57:30.033 --> 00:57:33.560
to all the people who come to me – let’s see.”

00:57:33.742 --> 00:57:40.109
And you are going to do full justice to my bold step

00:57:41.513 --> 00:57:46.653
because now you’ve got it. It is going to work out much faster.

00:57:46.773 --> 00:57:47.986
It has to work out.

00:57:48.106 --> 00:57:52.441
This was the only way it could have worked out faster than to make you,

00:57:52.561 --> 00:57:58.665
first of all, wash yourself every day, get up at 4 o’clock and make you

00:57:58.785 --> 00:58:06.167
like military people . I said, “No, let’s try this way.”

00:58:06.287 --> 00:58:10.998
And it’s done, it’s happening, it’s so simple.

00:58:11.427 --> 00:58:14.573
Then the self-discipline must start.

00:58:15.247 --> 00:58:17.735
And you must try to improve your light,

00:58:17.855 --> 00:58:19.634
which is just kindled,

00:58:19.754 --> 00:58:25.345
to make it a beautiful light, clean light and generous,

00:58:25.465 --> 00:58:29.580
giving light, the light of love.

00:58:30.318 --> 00:58:32.642
It will work out I am sure.

00:58:32.904 --> 00:58:37.771
Keep your standards high. Do not fall down.

00:58:38.350 --> 00:58:41.419
Put your attention into proper gear.

00:58:41.665 --> 00:58:46.432
It’s all prophesised, as you know. Blake has prophesised it.

00:58:46.552 --> 00:58:49.887
The more I read the book the more I am convinced

00:58:50.007 --> 00:58:53.171
that England is going to be the Jerusalem.

00:58:53.291 --> 00:58:58.507
Now think of that. No lethargy allowed.

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:04.428
While I find Australians are coming up much faster.

00:59:05.277 --> 00:59:09.527
You have to prove Blake’s prophesy.

00:59:09.647 --> 00:59:13.157
May God bless you. All of you.

00:59:15.832 --> 00:59:18.625
Cooly, can you give me some water please?

00:59:21.149 --> 00:59:22.827
Look at the children!!

00:59:23.954 --> 00:59:26.896
All quiet! Thank you very much.

00:59:35.888 --> 00:59:41.551
If you could arrange a seminar Gavin, anytime,

00:59:41.671 --> 00:59:46.337
for three days, I can postpone my going to India.

00:59:46.457 --> 00:59:48.875
As I would like to have a seminar sometime.

00:59:48.995 --> 00:59:53.433
Gavin: We can get a place in Sussex, from the,

00:59:53.980 --> 00:59:56.946
I think it’s the twelfth, no the eleventh, to the thirteenth,

00:59:57.066 --> 01:00:02.504
that’s a mid-week time. We can have about 45-50 people.

01:00:03.439 --> 01:00:04.888
Shri Mataji: We have many more.

01:00:07.849 --> 01:00:10.680
I would like to have it on a Saturday Sunday somewhere.

01:00:10.800 --> 01:00:12.106
Gavin: We can find somewhere

01:00:12.226 --> 01:00:14.947
but it is difficult to get these places for a weekend.

01:00:15.067 --> 01:00:16.908
We’re still trying.

01:00:17.369 --> 01:00:23.512
Shri Mataji: I think in a, any place, like Brighton or something

01:00:23.632 --> 01:00:28.378
you might get it, or why not hire a boat?

01:00:37.892 --> 01:00:39.629
Isn’t it a good idea?

01:00:39.749 --> 01:00:42.662
Gavin: We can see what we can do.

01:00:44.915 --> 01:00:46.839
Actually I was looking out for a ship.

01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:49.382
If one of the Shipping Corporation ships had arrived,

01:00:49.502 --> 01:00:52.357
I thought we’ll go and stay in a ship, would be a good idea,

01:00:52.478 --> 01:00:55.690
because it always is there for about three four days.

01:00:55.810 --> 01:00:59.010
But there’s no ship arriving in this month

01:00:59.130 --> 01:01:01.855
otherwise, we could have done it.

01:01:03.070 --> 01:01:05.498
Some sort of a boat for two days you can hire,

01:01:05.618 --> 01:01:09.855
a big boat where all of us could be there on a Saturday Sunday.

01:01:09.975 --> 01:01:11.766
We should be there, it’s important.

01:01:11.886 --> 01:01:16.539
Before I leave I would like to fix some certain screws.

01:01:19.871 --> 01:01:23.792
I mean, you can have it on Thames River if you want.

01:01:23.912 --> 01:01:29.877
Or Brighton, do you have boats or things? No? Just find out.

01:01:31.012 --> 01:01:32.657
So that should be resolved

01:01:32.777 --> 01:01:34.986
and then I will arrange my going accordingly.

01:01:35.106 --> 01:01:38.392
If there is any program like that I will postpone it.

01:01:38.512 --> 01:01:42.040
But I would like to know as soon as possible.

01:01:50.112 --> 01:01:54.696
As I have told you before that Sahaja Yoga has no technique;

01:01:54.816 --> 01:01:59.091
it’s a spontaneous happening which takes place.

01:02:00.694 --> 01:02:08.353
Now the flower becomes the fruit, it has no technique,

01:02:08.473 --> 01:02:12.819
but the sun has to come to do the job, you see,

01:02:12.939 --> 01:02:16.711
and that technique is beyond our understanding.

01:02:16.831 --> 01:02:21.772
In the same way it happens – just transformation.

01:02:23.217 --> 01:02:26.810
But later on you must know how to maintain

01:02:26.930 --> 01:02:28.741
and how to keep it up, that’s all.

01:02:28.861 --> 01:02:31.381
Once it is managed it can be worked out.

01:02:31.501 --> 01:02:36.631
Many people have done it, and you should be able to do it also.

01:02:37.107 --> 01:02:40.907
But try not to see others. See yourself first.

01:02:41.027 --> 01:02:45.354
That’s very important. That is a very important part.

01:02:45.474 --> 01:02:46.400
CLERCK

01:02:46.520 --> 01:02:50.277
If you can put your hands towards me, like this just,

01:02:51.927 --> 01:02:55.527
and close your eyes, just close your eyes.

01:03:04.049 --> 01:03:08.215
If your hands are shaking or your body is shaking

01:03:08.335 --> 01:03:12.791
or your eyes are fluttering, I mean the eyelids,

01:03:12.911 --> 01:03:16.596
then you open your eyes and just watch me,

01:03:17.539 --> 01:03:20.200
just watch me on my forehead.

01:03:23.811 --> 01:03:28.039
Have you been to some guru or someone? No one?

01:03:28.159 --> 01:03:31.224
What do you do for your work?

01:03:33.375 --> 01:03:34.647
Seeker: I’m a clerk.

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:37.460
Shri Mataji: Ah, that’s it.

01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:41.838
Ah, the right side is too much used.

01:03:43.417 --> 01:03:45.190
Should work out. Are

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:51.669
you shaking also?

01:03:52.287 --> 01:03:55.974
No? You are getting cool breeze? It’s great.

01:03:56.489 --> 01:04:03.861
Are you getting? Not yet. None of the fingers? Which one?

01:04:04.012 --> 01:04:09.744
Did you go to any guru or anyone? Did you to anyone? Guru or anyone?

01:04:09.864 --> 01:04:14.788
To spiritualist or anyone? No?

01:04:20.786 --> 01:04:24.417
Are you getting cool breeze? Good.

01:04:27.349 --> 01:04:32.974
Put both the feet straight. Relax. You are getting? Good.

01:04:33.094 --> 01:04:36.161
Close your eyes and enjoy your Self.

01:04:40.561 --> 01:04:43.442
Better now. Just do it like that, you see.

01:04:43.562 --> 01:04:45.903
It’s more on the right side, is a problem.

01:04:46.023 --> 01:04:49.221
It’s because too much thinking, thinking, you know.

01:04:49.341 --> 01:04:55.227
So the imbalance of…too much thinking also gives an imbalance, you see.

01:04:55.347 --> 01:04:58.071
All the time you’re thinking, thinking, thinking.

01:04:58.191 --> 01:05:02.020
That gives you a trouble. It should work out.

01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:07.173
See, put your left hand on the stomach, the centre, yes.

01:05:07.293 --> 01:05:11.827
Put your right hand now towards me, like this.

01:05:11.947 --> 01:05:14.819
Now the shaking will be less.

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:20.102
Put it there so you will be comfortable.

01:05:20.222 --> 01:05:22.916
It will reduce gradually.

01:05:23.036 --> 01:05:23.749
1’05’30

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:28.808
You See? This is nothing but there’s nervousness inside,

01:05:28.928 --> 01:05:30.326
which has to go out.

01:05:30.446 --> 01:05:35.518
You see the nerves have been too much tortured by thinking.

01:05:38.438 --> 01:05:41.770
Now it’s better, soothing down.

01:05:43.127 --> 01:05:44.653
Much better, see?

01:05:44.773 --> 01:05:46.789
It will soothe down.

01:05:46.909 --> 01:05:47.558
END CLERCK

01:05:47.678 --> 01:05:50.890
Anne, there are some new people I see on the left hand side.

01:05:51.010 --> 01:05:53.806
Just see them, if they are realised, all of them.

01:05:53.926 --> 01:05:58.524
Just see some of these people who are there.

01:06:00.443 --> 01:06:05.825
Yah, just see. Have you got cool breeze there?

01:06:06.134 --> 01:06:09.258
Have you got cool breeze in the hand?

01:06:11.901 --> 01:06:15.934
What did you say? You have got it?

01:06:16.054 --> 01:06:17.957
Seeker: YesShri Mataji: Good. Good.

01:06:18.077 --> 01:06:20.490
They are from Brighton are they?

01:06:20.610 --> 01:06:24.456
Have you come from Brighton? No. Good.

01:06:24.576 --> 01:06:30.650
Jason, just see if they are getting cool breeze on the head also.

01:06:31.687 --> 01:06:34.745
This side, are there new people?

01:06:37.261 --> 01:06:39.307
You got the cool breeze?

01:06:39.427 --> 01:06:40.337
Seeker: Not sure

01:06:40.457 --> 01:06:44.214
Shri Mataji: All right, it comes so much that you’ll get sure of it,

01:06:44.334 --> 01:06:49.528
all right? Just work it out.

01:06:52.873 --> 01:06:54.574
You can work out.

01:06:58.324 --> 01:06:59.929
There also.

01:07:00.049 --> 01:07:05.293
Peter, in front of you there, just see, someone.

01:07:07.063 --> 01:07:09.392
Behind is there someone sitting?

01:07:09.512 --> 01:07:12.367
He’s come for the first time?

01:07:15.550 --> 01:07:19.109
How are you, Anna? Better?

01:07:22.152 --> 01:07:24.647
She’s got it.

01:07:28.812 --> 01:07:31.781
Better now? It’s better.

01:07:31.901 --> 01:07:35.236
Still there? Less, but much less.

01:07:35.356 --> 01:07:39.329
Just do it like that.
Just throw it away. Throw it away.

01:07:39.449 --> 01:07:43.419
It has to go out. Now, let’s see.

01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:47.995
Just imagine.

01:07:48.115 --> 01:07:51.467
Throw it away again, it’s horrible.

01:07:54.105 --> 01:07:56.391
Who’s there?
Left to the right, you just put him,

01:07:56.511 --> 01:07:59.142
left to the right for him. Come along. Good.

01:07:59.262 --> 01:08:04.973
Put it left to the right yes.
They will do it. You put your right hand, yes.

01:08:07.381 --> 01:08:12.085
Are you better now? Are you feeling any cool breeze?

01:08:20.084 --> 01:08:22.553
How many years you have worked as a clerk?

01:08:22.673 --> 01:08:23.791
Clerk: Twelve.

01:08:30.227 --> 01:08:35.478
Shri Mataji: Look after his Vishuddhi
and centre heart. He’ll be all right.

01:08:35.661 --> 01:08:38.714
Yah! Vishuddhi and centre heart.

01:08:42.836 --> 01:08:46.244
Terrific, they are terrific people.

01:08:49.749 --> 01:08:52.593
All right, is she all right?

01:08:52.775 --> 01:08:56.682
What? Put your left hand here.

01:08:56.802 --> 01:08:59.854
All right? A little bit and put both the feet straight

01:08:59.974 --> 01:09:04.153
like that on the ground would be better. Like this,

01:09:04.574 --> 01:09:06.330
both the feet. Yes, let’s see.

01:09:06.450 --> 01:09:10.091
She’s all right, I think, she’s got it.

01:09:12.924 --> 01:09:19.167
She’s all right. What about this gentleman? Left to the right.

01:09:20.996 --> 01:09:23.952
It’s nice you came to see me.

01:09:24.928 --> 01:09:28.562
Really, because anything could have happened, you know,

01:09:28.682 --> 01:09:33.081
with this kind of a tremendous pressure on your mind.

01:09:33.525 --> 01:09:36.925
It’s still there. It will be.

01:09:39.928 --> 01:09:43.474
That’s how people get all these troubles, like diabetes, you see.

01:09:43.594 --> 01:09:47.222
Then even if they don’t listen to that then they could get heart.

01:09:47.342 --> 01:09:50.973
Then you get other problems on the left hand side, you see.

01:09:51.093 --> 01:09:53.493
Even paralysis can be due to this.

01:09:53.613 --> 01:09:58.427
It’s a very bad thing to work like that, worrying about it.

01:09:58.547 --> 01:10:00.245
Are you all right?

01:10:03.444 --> 01:10:05.482
It will work out. What is it, John?

01:10:05.602 --> 01:10:06.760
John Watkinson: Nabhi.

01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:09.159
