00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.040
Now, the Vidya Lakshmi is the one, as I told
you, gives you knowledge,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:12.120
knowledge how to handle the Divine Power graciously.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.600
I’ll give you an example.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.940
I’ve seen many people when they give bandhan,
it’s such a crude way, that..

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:20.820
No!

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.140
It is not to be done!

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.910
It’s a Lakshmi’s blessing.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.080
So how you do it, very carefully.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.000
You see Me, how I give always.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.960
I never do that way!

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.460
I cannot!

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.710
With respect, with grace.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.120
She represents the respect part of it.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.320
And that you get, that knowledge, how to do
it gracefully.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.540
Everything to be done gracefully, in a manner
that looks gracious.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.360
See, some people who talk have no grace,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.470
some people who give knowledge of Sahaja Yoga
also have no grace

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:04.520
and they talk in a disgraceful manner.

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:12.500
So all the grace, how to use the knowledge
of the Divine,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.600
is given by Vidya Lakshmi.
