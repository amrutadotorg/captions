1984-0708 Public Program 2 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth PP 2

00:02.000 --> 00:06.892
Now, again today, I would like you to ask Me some questions.

00:07.000 --> 00:12.892
There is going to be the fourth lecture, that they will announce.

00:13.000 --> 00:21.892
I hope you will make it a point to come and complete the series of lectures we have been having.

00:34.000 --> 00:49.892
Q1. [INAUDIBLE]

00:50.000 --> 00:53.892
A1. It’s true. It has been told that you must have a Guru.

00:54.000 --> 01:02.892
But it’s said that it has to be a Satguru. Anybody you see, mostly,

01:03.000 --> 01:08.892
the gurus who are in the market today. You cannot be in the market,

01:09.000 --> 01:17.892
and those who are in the market are actually, are nowhere near God.

01:18.000 --> 01:23.892
They have to be Satguru, means he has to be a realized soul of a very high degree.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.892
Now you better become your own Guru. And then you will know that you are a Satguru.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.892
I am the Mother, I am not a Guru. And what is Mother’s desire is? You had a mother also.

01:42.000 --> 01:47.892
Whatever I have, you better have it. That’s all.

01:48.000 --> 01:56.892
So as you have come to Mother, now you don’t ask for any guru, you better become yourself a Guru. All right?

01:57.000 --> 02:06.892
Q2. [INAUDIBLE]

02:07.000 --> 02:14.892
A2. No. You see, you must know that the Kundalini awakening itself, breaking through and all that,

02:15.000 --> 02:20.892
is a big happening. A key event of evolution, the epitome of it, as you know,

02:21.000 --> 02:28.892
as an Indian you know how Sakshatkar is such a big thing. But to achieve that,

02:29.000 --> 02:33.892
there must be a big machinery within us. Like you see the electrical bulb here, or a light here,

02:34.000 --> 02:42.892
you know there is a history behind it, and it is a big mechanism and organization that has worked it out.

02:43.000 --> 02:47.892
In the same way to achieve this there’s a big organization.

02:48.000 --> 02:57.892
So, when you become realized, that will happen very soon to you.

02:58.000 --> 03:02.892
Means you’ll feel the cool breeze coming out of the Brahmarandra, through your fontanel bone area.

03:03.000 --> 03:08.892
But then to develop it, you have to understand, deeper, the mechanism.

03:09.000 --> 03:18.892
Then the mantras are placed according to the deities of these seven chakras.

03:19.000 --> 03:28.892
Now if the Kundalini is stopping, or is weak at a point, any one of these chakras,

03:29.000 --> 03:33.892
then you have to say a particular mantra for that. Which will be told to you,

03:34.000 --> 03:39.892
which you can learn very easily. And you will know also about all the mantras that are to be said.

03:40.000 --> 03:45.892
Like, you see, many gurus I have seen give away one mantra. Like they say Ram.

03:46.000 --> 03:53.892
How can that be? You see, there are seven chakras, and if you take Ram,

03:54.000 --> 03:57.892
he’s on the right side of the heart chakra, means [UNKNOWN SANSKRIT WORD].

03:58.000 --> 04:01.892
Now, if you are taking the name of Rama, why, why Rama’s name?

04:02.000 --> 04:08.892
Ask a question to him, you must ask a question. Why Rama’s name, why not Krishna’s?

04:09.000 --> 04:14.892
Why not Jesus? The reason is, if he’s a Satguru he’ll tell you,

04:15.000 --> 04:22.892
that you have a problem with your right heart. But all of them here, those who are realization souls,

04:23.000 --> 04:27.892
can tell you where is the problem. And you will also tell tomorrow.

04:28.000 --> 04:29.892
Q3. [INAUDIBLE]

04:30.000 --> 04:35.892
A3. No, it’s not. There are seven mantras actually. Basically you must know about seven mantras.

04:36.000 --> 04:40.892
But gradually, you pick it up in no time, because immediately you know where the problem is,

04:41.000 --> 04:43.892
and immediately you say the mantra. It’s not very difficult, it’s very simple.

04:44.000 --> 04:47.892
It is woven in a pattern and it’s very simple to say those mantras.

04:48.000 --> 04:53.892
But it works out so spontaneously, I mean, these are all people who are English

04:54.000 --> 05:00.892
and Greeks and this and that, and they don’t know. Even, we can say mantras in English language now.

05:01.000 --> 05:11.892
That’s an advancement I think. That all the deities can understand English language as well.

05:12.000 --> 05:17.892
So you can say it in Sanskrit or in English, it’s all right, it works out.

05:18.000 --> 05:23.892
And, once you know it, it’s so easy to say it, easy to understand. It’s not a problem at all.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.892
But first of all you should get your realization, that’s first thing.

05:28.000 --> 05:33.892
That is you should break through, you see, the seed must break. [INAUDIBLE], its primule must break.

05:34.000 --> 05:38.892
Then the second thing is to see that it sustains itself above the ground.

05:39.000 --> 05:44.892
Then it is to be maintained and developed until you become a tree.

05:45.000 --> 05:48.892
But it’s very simple, it’s not difficult.

05:49.000 --> 05:51.892
Q4. [INAUDIBLE]

05:52.000 --> 05:57.892
A4. When you get your realization you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area

05:58.000 --> 06:02.892
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands. Then you can ask a question,

06:03.000 --> 06:07.892
is this the breeze of the Adi Shakti? Is this the Chaitanya Lahari of the Adi Shakti?

06:08.000 --> 06:12.892
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti actually.

06:13.000 --> 06:18.892
Nobody has explained to them, they don’t know. I mean, they asked the Archbishop of Canterbury

06:19.000 --> 06:22.892
about Holy Ghost, he said “I’m agnostic,” can you imagine?

06:23.000 --> 06:27.892
Yes, he answered. I mean, if he’s agnostic this Robin Day asked him

06:28.000 --> 06:32.892
“So what are you doing here?” So he said “I’m doing my job.” So Robin Day said

06:33.000 --> 06:39.892
“Yes” because he also does the job. He understood it. [HINDI].

06:40.000 --> 06:44.892
Now the problem is that when you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

06:45.000 --> 06:48.892
you might find that after some time it goes away then comes. See, depends on.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.892
Some people have a express train, as we call it.

06:54.000 --> 06:59.892
But some of them have some bogeys, which go up and down. It doesn’t matter.

07:00.000 --> 07:07.892
We should not frustrate on that point, it works out. One should not get unhappy about it.

07:08.000 --> 07:21.892
Q5. [INAUDIBLE]

07:22.000 --> 07:31.892
A5. Subconscious. Of course, I mean the same. I am the Self, I am the Spirit, yes.

07:32.000 --> 07:39.892
Like, I’ll tell you, in the bible, Christ clearly said it, very clearly, we don’t read bible that way,

07:40.000 --> 07:45.892
that’s why. That Nicodemus, you see, He told Nicodemus that you are to be born again.

07:46.000 --> 07:51.892
So, Nicodemus said that does that mean that I should enter into the womb of my mother.

07:52.000 --> 07:59.892
He said no, that is flesh, and the flesh is born out of, whatever is born out of flesh is flesh.

08:00.000 --> 08:07.892
You are to be born of your Spirit. And whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit He said.

08:08.000 --> 08:19.892
But how many people follow that? That’s the consciousness I’m talking of, the real Selfhood.

08:20.000 --> 08:28.892
What we do, in the churches, or in our Indian, any one of the religions that we have.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.892
We put the water on the head, now you are baptized, you are a Christian.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.892
For a Hindu they put a string, now you are a Brahmin, without knowing a word about Brahma.

08:38.000 --> 08:44.892
[INAUDIBLE]. So now, there is reality.

08:45.000 --> 08:50.892
All these people didn’t tell us lies you see, never told us lies.

08:51.000 --> 08:57.892
But the truth is always covered by the intellectuals, by the intelligent people on one side

08:58.000 --> 09:02.892
and by the fanatics on the other side, and that’s why the problem comes in.

09:03.000 --> 09:14.892
Q6. [INAUDIBLE]

09:15.000 --> 09:19.892
A6. You see, because, what happens that intellectuals rationalize it.

09:20.000 --> 09:23.892
They say whatever we see, we see the science, so we don’t want to believe.

09:24.000 --> 09:27.892
Now recently there has been a controversy about Christ miracles, isn’t it.

09:28.000 --> 09:38.892
There, lets take this thing very recently, there’s a controversy about Christ’s being born of a virgin.

09:39.000 --> 09:44.892
He was born of a virgin, no doubt, but how can you convince an intellectual you see,

09:45.000 --> 09:49.892
because He cannot be born of a virgin. But He was born.

09:50.000 --> 09:52.892
All these miracles are absolute truth, no doubt.

09:53.000 --> 09:56.892
So the problem is they want to see through science. Now science is analytical,

09:57.000 --> 10:03.892
it is not does the synthesis. Science deals with the dead.

10:04.000 --> 10:07.892
It deadens everything, it analyzes, and whatever you see you think it’s the truth, no,

10:08.000 --> 10:13.892
but it’s just a part of the truth. Now why do they accept?

10:14.000 --> 10:20.892
See now, big challenge, is intellectual. This was Mr Paul, who came in.

10:21.000 --> 10:25.892
When I was a child I asked My father, who is this Paul?

10:26.000 --> 10:32.892
My father, being a very great realized soul himself, he said, he was another mad man.

10:33.000 --> 10:38.892
And this Paul had never seen Christ. What we call, he had a supraconscious,

10:39.000 --> 10:41.892
a kind of a [CONDITION or POSITION?], he got blind and all that.

10:42.000 --> 10:46.892
And then he became, he was a horrible man, he killed so many Jews,

10:47.000 --> 10:50.892
he killed the young boys for [STEALING?] you know he did all sorts of things and then suddenly,

10:51.000 --> 10:56.892
he becomes a big Christian. Because he saw some sort of a political thing in that.

10:57.000 --> 11:01.892
So what does he say, he doesn’t talk of Christ as He was, he talks of a Christ

11:02.000 --> 11:06.892
which was the church Christ, the Christ of the church.

11:07.000 --> 11:12.892
Now, Christ of the church has nothing to do with real Christ, has nothing to do.

11:13.000 --> 11:17.892
So now, because they have to accept, the churches have to accept Paul,

11:18.000 --> 11:23.892
they cannot accept Christ. It’s a good idea. Either accept Christ, or accept,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.892
this is what happens with intellectuals. Even in India it has happened.

11:28.000 --> 11:34.892
I’ll tell you when, when Adi Shankaracharya, he wrote a book called Viviketurya.

11:35.000 --> 11:40.892
It’s a great treatise. About Athvaida [BEST GUESS] he said that God is everything,

11:41.000 --> 11:48.892
Brahma is everything. A beautiful treatise he wrote. So there was a fellow called Vishra,

11:49.000 --> 11:53.892
Mandan Vishra [BEST GUESS], is a great learned man, another intellectual,

11:54.000 --> 11:57.892
he came to argue with him. And he argued and argued and argued,

11:58.000 --> 12:00.892
you see with argument where do you reach? You cannot by arguing give realization to somebody.

12:01.000 --> 12:06.892
And he said, “Why don’t you take your realization?” But he argued,

12:07.000 --> 12:10.892
he said “You defeat me.” He said “I don’t want to defeat you I want to give you realization,

12:11.000 --> 12:15.892
why don’t you take your realization?” He would not take the realization.

12:16.000 --> 12:23.892
So, the intellectual, you see, tortured his life. He was so fed up, Adi Shankaracharya.

12:24.000 --> 12:27.892
The book he wrote was Saundarya Lahiri, if you ever happen to read it,

12:28.000 --> 12:33.892
it’s nothing but the praise of the Mother, throughout. He said this is how [SANSKRIT]

12:34.000 --> 12:36.892
not by yoga by Sankara [BEST GUESS] by discussion, it’s only through Mother’s grace

12:37.000 --> 12:42.892
you are going to get realization [INAUDIBLE].

12:43.000 --> 12:49.892
So the intellectuals, you see, want to derive a pleasure of an intellectual feat out of most if it.

12:50.000 --> 12:58.892
It’s not the real that they are seeking. They read, a lot, achieve nothing.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.892
I have known people who are very learned, who have written many books

13:02.000 --> 13:10.892
and they are so horribly immoral within their private life you can’t believe it that they could be philosophers.

13:11.000 --> 13:16.892
And you don’t understand, how can you be, why are you so hypocritical? But they are.

13:17.000 --> 13:22.892
Because they are not realized souls. And an ordinary person, you find a realized soul.

13:23.000 --> 13:30.892
Just uneducated. That’s why Kabira has said Pari Pari Pundita Mura Kabai,

13:31.000 --> 13:40.892
by reading too much you learned have become stupid. But I don’t say all learned are stupid.

13:41.000 --> 13:48.892
No. But learning should reach that supreme power of intelligence, which is pure intelligence.

13:49.000 --> 13:53.892
Then obviously you see the thing and you accept if you are honest as I said in the beginning.

13:54.000 --> 13:58.892
You must have that pure intelligence to see, God is there.

13:59.000 --> 14:03.892
He’s above everything, he’s above your intelligence, above your thoughts.

14:04.000 --> 14:09.892
You have to feel him first, you have to rise. That is the transformation, if you cannot achieve,

14:10.000 --> 14:17.892
then how can I talk to you? If a person is blind,

14:18.000 --> 14:24.892
what’s the use of talking about colors to a blind person, what does he understand?

14:25.000 --> 14:30.892
He can’t even see whether I’m smiling or laughing or if I’m crying. What can you talk?

14:31.000 --> 14:38.892
So the eyes must be open, and these eyes which I’m talking of are above your thought.

14:39.000 --> 14:42.892
You cannot by your projection get it.

14:43.000 --> 14:51.892
It has to come to you. It’s a grace. Ashedvard [BEST GUESS].

14:52.000 --> 14:59.892
Q7. [INAUDIBLE]

15:00.000 --> 15:05.892
A7. No You see what I would suggest that what happens that once you get your realisation

15:06.000 --> 15:11.892
then I have seen a person who has developed the intellect,

15:12.000 --> 15:17.892
understands it in an intellectual way what realization is

15:18.000 --> 15:25.892
and a person who is not supposed to be so intelligent starts talking like saints.

15:26.000 --> 15:31.892
I had gone to a village in India and there was a person who was, I was going on a bullock cart,

15:32.000 --> 15:35.892
he was driving Me and I asked him when he did you get your realization

15:36.000 --> 15:40.892
and then he started talking to Me. I said “Kabira is driving Me or what?”

15:41.000 --> 15:48.892
How is he talking like this?” The truth, tremendous, what intelligence.

15:49.000 --> 15:55.892
How much Christ studied in what university?

15:56.000 --> 16:03.892
So we should not misunderstand intelligence I mean the divine intelligence,

16:04.000 --> 16:06.892
that’s a very different thing.

16:07.000 --> 16:25.892
Q8. [INAUDIBLE]

16:26.000 --> 16:32.892
A8. You are, all the time, if you, Shaktipad [BEST GUESS] is the word they use it,

16:33.000 --> 16:38.892
Shaktipad you see, but it is very much misused. Shaktipad means people start dancing like mad,

16:39.000 --> 16:43.892
they start shouting screaming how can that be Shaktipad? That’s madness, that’s possession,

16:44.000 --> 16:51.892
you get possessed. Shaktipad means if somebody is a Shakti,

16:52.000 --> 16:56.892
you see the Shakti of that person enters into your being and invites your Kundalini

16:57.000 --> 16:59.892
so the Kundalini rises. That’s what actually it is

17:00.000 --> 17:04.892
and then the Kundalini rises and makes you a beautiful person

17:05.000 --> 17:08.892
it doesn’t make you a mad person no how can it be?

17:09.000 --> 17:13.892
Just imagine now after evolving yourself from amoeba and all the donkeys

17:14.000 --> 17:22.892
and all the monkeys and what else, oh, cockroaches are you going to become a mad person?

17:23.000 --> 17:27.892
Or a frog, jumping like that.

17:28.000 --> 17:32.892
So this is very much, that’s why I don’t use very much Shaktipad power because these days

17:33.000 --> 17:39.892
every Dick, Tom and Harry is using you see. Shaktipad that’s not what I mean.

17:40.000 --> 17:42.892
Shaktipad means if somebody has Shakti it just works.

17:43.000 --> 17:48.892
You don’t go and put it in the head of that person, it just flows, all right?

17:49.000 --> 17:55.892
But it was used in Patanjali’s day in that way but who reads Patanjali? Nobody reads I think

17:56.000 --> 18:00.892
nobody reads and talks about it. What they talk is some sort of a head standing

18:01.000 --> 18:05.892
some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE SHEERSH] asana that’s all. I mean that’s we, we, we, part of it.

18:06.000 --> 18:11.892
Nobody reads him I mean if you read it, I mean, [INAUDIBLE] you see what he has written is

18:12.000 --> 18:17.892
that’s what I am doing. I am quite surprised how people talk about this thing.

18:18.000 --> 18:24.892
What he says you achieve [SANSKRIT] means you become effortless

18:25.000 --> 18:29.892
first [SANSKRIT] you become without thoughtless,

18:30.000 --> 18:37.892
then the third thing he says you become complete negation of thought, [SANSKRIT].

18:38.000 --> 18:44.892
But here it is they are all jumping, talking big, this, that, how can that be?

18:45.000 --> 18:50.892
Meditation means jumping in the air, how can it be? [HINDI]

18:51.000 --> 18:55.892
Indians understand thank God, Indians are that way you see, safe.

18:56.000 --> 18:59.892
But there should be seeking in India. You see these people are seeking

19:00.000 --> 19:04.892
and striving and they are the ones who want it, I must tell you very frankly

19:05.000 --> 19:10.892
they are the people who really are nicely seeking, in England I am saying not in India.

19:11.000 --> 19:21.892
But Indians are not seeking that, but they have one great thing in them is that they know what is reality.

19:22.000 --> 19:26.892
They understand. You see like some of the people who went to a Guru,

19:27.000 --> 19:33.892
I must tell you, and he gave them a mantra for which he charged £300 in secret, in the ears,

19:34.000 --> 19:44.892
nobody to be told. And the mantra was “Tinga”. “Tinga” and they told Me in the ear

19:45.000 --> 19:52.892
and I couldn’t help laughing, “Tinga” means showing like this to someone.

19:53.000 --> 19:56.892
And he used to giggle at people because they were all so stupid, poor things,

19:57.000 --> 19:59.892
but they were seekers, real seekers, you know,

20:00.000 --> 20:08.892
of such high quality and this fellow who told Me was a barrister can you imagine?

20:09.000 --> 20:24.892
Q9. [INAUDIBLE]

20:25.000 --> 20:29.892
A9. Yes, you are part, you are part of the whole. You are part and parcel of the whole.

20:30.000 --> 20:33.892
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm,

20:34.000 --> 20:39.892
as we say in Sanskrit is Virata, you become part and parcel of that Virata.

20:40.000 --> 20:56.892
Q10. [INAUDIBLE]

20:57.000 --> 21:01.892
A10. No, no, no. [INAUDIBLE] Correct.

21:02.000 --> 21:10.892
See it may look like that because the myth of responsibility drops out.

21:11.000 --> 21:17.892
Supposing, this wire thinks that it is responsible for what I am speaking,

21:18.000 --> 21:25.892
does it become more efficient? Say, what responsibility we have is like this.

21:26.000 --> 21:31.892
When we are going by a plane, question is very good, I have seen it. I mean actually,

21:32.000 --> 21:37.892
it must be understood in its full context it’s correct that when you think it is the responsibility of God

21:38.000 --> 21:40.892
you see, then you become irresponsible.

21:41.000 --> 21:45.892
On the contrary, you become an instrument into his hands you see.

21:46.000 --> 21:51.892
But you don’t think that you are doing it yourself, like you are sitting in the play.

21:52.000 --> 21:54.892
I give this example many a times because I have seen this happen.

21:55.000 --> 21:59.892
Some villagers never knew how to go by plane so they were told not to take too much luggage.

22:00.000 --> 22:03.892
They sat in the plane and put all their luggage on their heads.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.892
Carrying the responsibility of the plane, saying that we have to carry the load

22:09.000 --> 22:13.892
because we don’t want the plane to carry all our loads you see.

22:14.000 --> 22:18.892
So that myth drops out, that myth drops out.

22:19.000 --> 22:21.892
But you become a very efficient person

22:22.000 --> 22:27.892
because the energy that’s divine starts dynamically working, manifesting.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.892
You become a dynamic person, you can do a thousand and one things

22:32.000 --> 22:35.892
which you have never done before, because you have become a perfect instrument.

22:36.000 --> 22:45.892
You are not perfect as long as you think you are doing it, you see My point?

22:46.000 --> 22:59.892
All of them, those who are realised souls, and you will be too.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.892
What work are they doing, is spiritually they are doing a lot of work, now,

23:04.000 --> 23:09.892
that’s another side when you’ll come to Sahaja Yoga we’ll tell you what work they are doing.

23:10.000 --> 23:14.892
You see what work you want us to do may not be the work that we are doing

23:15.000 --> 23:19.892
but we are transforming people. We are saving people from cancers and so many diseases,

23:20.000 --> 23:24.892
we are transforming them, we are changing them so much that they have given up drugs.

23:25.000 --> 23:30.892
So many people have given up alcohol, all these bad habits have dropped out.

23:31.000 --> 23:35.892
So many people are cured of so many diseases, so many diseases we have cured already,

23:36.000 --> 23:41.892
when you come to us we will let you know as to what substantial work it is. all right?

23:42.000 --> 23:47.892
Starvation of course, our starvation. Why people are starving also

23:48.000 --> 23:54.892
because I think people who drink are starving because they waste their money in drink.

23:55.000 --> 23:57.892
If they haven’t, if they have money why should they drink?

23:58.000 --> 24:01.892
If they don’t have money why should they drink? But most of the people starve themselves

24:02.000 --> 24:06.892
because they spend all their money, in UK I am saying, not in India, India is a different thing.

24:07.000 --> 24:13.892
But in India people who have got realization are blessed they don’t starve anymore.

24:14.000 --> 28:29.892
[INAUDIBLE]

24:31.000 --> 24:37.892
first you get your yoga, your union with God and then I will bless you. Kshema.

24:38.000 --> 24:41.892
[INAUDIBLE]

24:42.000 --> 24:45.892
Yes, yes, of course, of course you can pay your rates, everything,

24:46.000 --> 24:50.892
but you just come and see before. This is the intellectual side, come inside and see,

24:51.000 --> 24:56.892
whether it works out or not. Why not see? Don’t argue for arguments sake, it works out.

24:57.000 --> 25:03.892
There’s somebody sitting behind you who has, in his life it has worked out, just behind.

25:04.000 --> 25:09.892
In many lives it has worked out but you come and see for yourself what miracles it has, all right?

25:10.000 --> 25:13.892
You come and see all previous things just drop off.

25:14.000 --> 25:18.892
Come and see how God is blissful after all the blessings come from God.

25:19.000 --> 25:23.892
But we don’t want to do anything for God and why not God look after us,

25:24.000 --> 25:32.892
what have you done for God so far. Can I ask a question?

25:33.000 --> 25:42.892
Everyone has right to ask a question to Me, I better ask you all. What have you done for God?

25:43.000 --> 25:59.892
Just surrender it. [INAUDIBLE] You are afraid? [INAUDIBLE] Afraid of God? [INAUDIBLE] Pray?

26:00.000 --> 26:06.892
But what we pray to God is “Give me my food. Give me a job.

26:07.000 --> 26:19.892
God get me this. Let me win this war. Let’s kill my enemies” I know all those prayers.

26:38.000 --> 26:44.892
Q11. [INAUDIBLE]

26:45.000 --> 26:51.892
A11. First you get connected all right. First let us get connected then you will know.

26:52.000 --> 26:56.892
Then you will know what He wants and what He does.

26:57.000 --> 27:02.892
Then you will know He is very kind man, very kind,

27:03.000 --> 27:08.892
extremely forgiving that the way He has forgiven us for whatever we have done.

27:09.000 --> 27:11.892
But don’t feel guilty for it, that’s one thing I didn’t want to start,

27:12.000 --> 27:15.892
because you see that’s one trouble you all have is to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel guilty

27:16.000 --> 27:18.892
because realization doesn’t work out.

27:19.000 --> 27:29.892
Don’t feel guilty it’s all right. We’ll have it next time madam, is it something important?

27:30.000 --> 27:56.892
Q12. [INAUDIBLE]

27:57.000 --> 27:59.892
A12. Talk. Talking is not the thing,

28:00.000 --> 28:05.892
you see what I would say you should see the way they talk has nothing to do,

28:06.000 --> 28:09.892
what you have to see, what have you achieved yourself.

28:10.000 --> 28:14.892
Whatever people may talk is they might be talking because they are possessed, that’s all.

28:15.000 --> 28:23.892
If somebody talks big be careful, be careful, the one who does, isn’t.

28:24.000 --> 28:28.892
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head is the point I said that nobody can do,

28:29.000 --> 28:31.892
can anybody do that?

28:30.000 --> 28:32.000
They don’t need anything, it is said that Yoga Kshema Wiam Miam,

28:32.000 --> 28:43.892
Those who talk can be good actors at the most, at the worst they are possessed. [INAUDIBLE]

28:44.000 --> 28:54.892
Q13. [INAUDIBLE]

28:55.000 --> 28:58.892
A13. Your married life improves immensely.

28:59.000 --> 29:05.892
Because you will learn later on there is a centre for it and you understand your married life as a bliss,

29:06.000 --> 29:11.892
it’s absolutely pure blessings to married people. Actually you will be surprised

29:12.000 --> 29:14.892
we can’t give realization to people who are not married, in the sense

29:15.000 --> 29:22.892
who are going to marry is all right. But those who are against marriage we can’t give realization

29:23.000 --> 29:25.892
because they are a little imbalanced.

29:26.000 --> 29:34.892
I think the one we had you see, we couldn’t give realization, I hope he’s not here.

29:35.000 --> 29:39.892
But he is going to get married so we will give him realization,

29:40.000 --> 29:44.892
we just couldn’t give him, but married life improves like this.

29:45.000 --> 30:04.892
Q14. [INAUDIBLE]

30:05.000 --> 30:17.892
A 14. What is it about Bhagwan? [HINDI]

30:18.000 --> 30:27.892
This kind of a Bhagwan, who cannot even smell a flower. Can you think of a Bhagwan like that?

30:28.000 --> 30:32.892
You know in the Devi Mahatmayam or into the Vishnu Shastranama,

30:33.000 --> 30:40.892
or anyone of them where there is a described God at least twenty five names of God is he’s fond of flower, fragrance, flower.

30:41.000 --> 30:46.892
I can’t live without flowers and the fellow who cannot smell a flower [HINDI]

30:47.000 --> 30:52.892
I mean what do you give him? Phenyl or something?

30:53.000 --> 31:12.892
This is one of the tests. How can you be a Bhagwan? [SANSKRIT] These are the names of God.

31:13.000 --> 31:33.892
Q15. [INAUDIBLE]

31:34.000 --> 31:38.892
A15. You see, say now if I give you Indian money say 100 rupees how do you know it is 100 rupees?

31:39.000 --> 31:42.892
You have to go to India and spend it and see if it works out or not.

31:43.000 --> 31:47.892
In the same way when you get the vibrations and you feel the cool breeze you spend it

31:48.000 --> 31:53.892
and see for yourself and judge it.

31:54.000 --> 31:58.892
You can do the whole process yourself, you can give realization to others all right?

32:04.000 --> 32:08.892
You see now I would say please get your realization, if you get it, I don’t promise, if you get it.

32:09.000 --> 32:15.892
That’s a very big if, sometimes. I know it happens if you get it

32:16.000 --> 32:21.892
then you have to go and see for yourself whether it works or not.

32:22.000 --> 32:27.892
But to get it is not easy in certain cases,

32:28.000 --> 32:34.892
so be cheerful about it and be patient with yourself.

32:35.000 --> 32:38.892
More patience is needed with yourself, not with Me because I am extremely patient.

32:39.000 --> 32:43.892
You have to be patient with yourself because your mind will be coming up and always saying something,

32:44.000 --> 32:47.892
you didn’t ask this question, you should have asked this question, tell your mind to be quiet.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.892
Take your realization, lets see if it works out.

32:52.000 --> 32:59.892
We cannot assure, it may, it may not, it’s your luck, that’s it.

33:00.000 --> 33:27.892
Q16. [INAUDIBLE]

33:28.000 --> 33:32.892
A16. This conscious mind that you have just now is the human awareness, all right,

33:33.000 --> 33:39.892
at this point the human awareness is at such a stage, that you are not connected with your spirit.

33:40.000 --> 33:43.892
First your human awareness has to be raised it has to be brought to that point

33:44.000 --> 33:47.892
where you get connected. Like this instrument is here now,

33:48.000 --> 33:51.892
consciously whatever you do with this it is not connected, it has no meaning.

33:52.000 --> 33:54.892
In the same way first you should be connected.

33:55.000 --> 33:58.892
After connecting only we can see where is the problem is, what is missing, what is it

33:59.000 --> 34:03.892
and is to be done. So we have to take a very reasonable attitude towards it,

34:04.000 --> 34:07.892
about ourselves, to understand that maybe there is something missing,

34:08.000 --> 34:12.892
something is happening, it’s not working out.

34:13.000 --> 34:19.892
Because at this awareness, at this consciousness that you have, this human consciousness is not sufficient.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.892
So you have to jump, there’s a breakthrough, and you have to achieve that breakthrough.

34:24.000 --> 34:27.892
Which I will not promise, as I told that gentleman there you, it cannot be promised,

34:28.000 --> 34:35.892
it has to be achieved. If you get it then you have to have patience with yourself work it out and see for yourself.

34:36.000 --> 34:47.892
Q17. [INAUDIBLE]

34:48.000 --> 34:50.892
A17. Yes They did because that was the time you see.

34:51.000 --> 34:53.892
Now Jesus came at a time when our Agnya chakra was opened,

34:54.000 --> 35:02.892
see it’s like a Tree of Life has to grow you see and They come at a proper time what has to grow.

35:03.000 --> 35:06.892
Now if it’s the root time and somebody else came in, when the shoot started

35:07.000 --> 35:10.892
somebody else came in gradually it has come up to this point. Now Mohammed,

35:11.000 --> 35:13.892
what Mohamed has said, nobody says that today.

35:14.000 --> 35:18.892
All the Muslims must know that He said “At the time of the resurrection your hands must speak”,

35:19.000 --> 35:24.892
where is that? He said it I mean nobody else but Mohammed had said so clearly about it.

35:25.000 --> 35:31.892
And what does He say is not known nobody knows why He said [INAUDIBLE-namas] like this.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.892
Nobody asked questions, why do you follow?

35:35.000 --> 35:38.892
But after Sahaja yoga will know what [INAUDIBLE] what Mohammed means,

35:39.000 --> 35:43.892
who He was and why He said so what is so important about it.

35:44.000 --> 35:48.892
You can’t understand even Mohammed or anyone, Jesus or anyone, without realization

35:49.000 --> 35:54.892
because you have not entered into that rank, you see My point.

35:55.000 --> 36:00.892
Because the time that time was not to say whatever They had to do They did very important work very, very important.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.892
Every one of Them have worked very hard.

36:05.000 --> 36:12.892
Only I must say that today I am at an advantage than They are

36:13.000 --> 36:21.892
because so many are getting self-realization. They had a very bad time.

36:22.000 --> 36:28.892
They had a very bad time nobody accepted Them. All acceptance came later on when

36:29.000 --> 36:31.892
They were not there and people liked to have such acceptance

36:32.000 --> 36:36.892
because they can do what they like. They don’t want to,

36:37.000 --> 36:40.892
nobody asked Them for realization at that time, nobody, everybody tried just to kill Them.

36:41.000 --> 36:49.892
I mean everybody was anxious how to get rid of Them, isn’t it a fact?

36:50.000 --> 36:53.892
Like today as there are so many who want their realization that time was not there.

36:54.000 --> 36:58.892
Today is the time, all right?

36:59.000 --> 37:29.892
Q18. [INAUDIBLE]

37:30.000 --> 37:33.892
A18. You see that you don’t even need one minute for that, to say, “I’m born again”

37:34.000 --> 37:39.892
it is all self-opinionated thing, just to say. But you have to have powers you see

37:40.000 --> 37:41.892
that’s what I told you the whole lecture was like that.

37:42.000 --> 37:46.892
That once you get self realised you get the powers you have collective consciousness you become conscious.

37:47.000 --> 37:52.892
You see it is very easy to say, just to put the, I don’t know how much they pay

37:53.000 --> 37:57.892
but you just put the name membership “I’m born again”. You don’t know this born again people,

37:58.000 --> 38:02.892
horribly hot tempered, useless people absolutely. You see some of them brought some bibles

38:03.000 --> 38:06.892
and one lady bearing all artificial jewellery here and there and she came to give Me the bible

38:07.000 --> 38:12.892
and I just ignored her. I just started laughing and she was quite surprised to hear this sound.

38:13.000 --> 38:18.892
So this is what born again how can they be born again if they can’t make out a saint.

38:19.000 --> 38:21.892
How can they be born again? [INAUDIBLE]

38:36.000 --> 38:44.892
Only the truth will survive. All these are fads and things [INAUDIBLE] it has no meaning.

38:45.000 --> 38:45.000
END
