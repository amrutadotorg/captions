1984-0708 Public Program 2 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth PP 2

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.892
Now, again today, I would like you to ask Me some questions.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.892
There is going to be the fourth lecture, that they will announce.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.892
I hope you will make it a point to come and complete the series of lectures we have been having.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:49.892
Q1. [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.892
A1. It’s true. It has been told that you must have a Guru.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.892
But it’s said that it has to be a Satguru. Anybody you see, mostly,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.892
the gurus who are in the market today. You cannot be in the market,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.892
and those who are in the market are actually, are nowhere near God.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.892
They have to be Satguru, means he has to be a realized soul of a very high degree.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.892
Now you better become your own Guru. And then you will know that you are a Satguru.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.892
I am the Mother, I am not a Guru. And what is Mother’s desire is? You had a mother also.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.892
Whatever I have, you better have it. That’s all.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:56.892
So as you have come to Mother, now you don’t ask for any guru, you better become yourself a Guru. All right?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:06.892
Q2. [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.892
A2. No. You see, you must know that the Kundalini awakening itself, breaking through and all that,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.892
is a big happening. A key event of evolution, the epitome of it, as you know,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.892
as an Indian you know how Sakshatkar is such a big thing. But to achieve that,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.892
there must be a big machinery within us. Like you see the electrical bulb here, or a light here,

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.892
you know there is a history behind it, and it is a big mechanism and organization that has worked it out.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:47.892
In the same way to achieve this there’s a big organization.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:57.892
So, when you become realized, that will happen very soon to you.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.892
Means you’ll feel the cool breeze coming out of the Brahmarandra, through your fontanel bone area.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.892
But then to develop it, you have to understand, deeper, the mechanism.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.892
Then the mantras are placed according to the deities of these seven chakras.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:28.892
Now if the Kundalini is stopping, or is weak at a point, any one of these chakras,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.892
then you have to say a particular mantra for that. Which will be told to you,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.892
which you can learn very easily. And you will know also about all the mantras that are to be said.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.892
Like, you see, many gurus I have seen give away one mantra. Like they say Ram.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:53.892
How can that be? You see, there are seven chakras, and if you take Ram,

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.892
he’s on the right side of the heart chakra, means [UNKNOWN SANSKRIT WORD].

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:01.892
Now, if you are taking the name of Rama, why, why Rama’s name?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.892
Ask a question to him, you must ask a question. Why Rama’s name, why not Krishna’s?

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.892
Why not Jesus? The reason is, if he’s a Satguru he’ll tell you,

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:22.892
that you have a problem with your right heart. But all of them here, those who are realization souls,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.892
can tell you where is the problem. And you will also tell tomorrow.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.892
Q3. [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.892
A3. No, it’s not. There are seven mantras actually. Basically you must know about seven mantras.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.892
But gradually, you pick it up in no time, because immediately you know where the problem is,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.892
and immediately you say the mantra. It’s not very difficult, it’s very simple.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.892
It is woven in a pattern and it’s very simple to say those mantras.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.892
But it works out so spontaneously, I mean, these are all people who are English

00:04:54.000 --> 00:05:00.892
and Greeks and this and that, and they don’t know. Even, we can say mantras in English language now.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:11.892
That’s an advancement I think. That all the deities can understand English language as well.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:17.892
So you can say it in Sanskrit or in English, it’s all right, it works out.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.892
And, once you know it, it’s so easy to say it, easy to understand. It’s not a problem at all.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.892
But first of all you should get your realization, that’s first thing.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.892
That is you should break through, you see, the seed must break. [INAUDIBLE], its primule must break.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.892
Then the second thing is to see that it sustains itself above the ground.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.892
Then it is to be maintained and developed until you become a tree.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.892
But it’s very simple, it’s not difficult.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.892
Q4. [INAUDIBLE]

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.892
A4. When you get your realization you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.892
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands. Then you can ask a question,

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.892
is this the breeze of the Adi Shakti? Is this the Chaitanya Lahari of the Adi Shakti?

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.892
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti actually.

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.892
Nobody has explained to them, they don’t know. I mean, they asked the Archbishop of Canterbury

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:22.892
about Holy Ghost, he said “I’m agnostic,” can you imagine?

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.892
Yes, he answered. I mean, if he’s agnostic this Robin Day asked him

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.892
“So what are you doing here?” So he said “I’m doing my job.” So Robin Day said

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.892
“Yes” because he also does the job. He understood it. [HINDI].

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.892
Now the problem is that when you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.892
you might find that after some time it goes away then comes. See, depends on.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.892
Some people have a express train, as we call it.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.892
But some of them have some bogeys, which go up and down. It doesn’t matter.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.892
We should not frustrate on that point, it works out. One should not get unhappy about it.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:21.892
Q5. [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:31.892
A5. Subconscious. Of course, I mean the same. I am the Self, I am the Spirit, yes.

00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:39.892
Like, I’ll tell you, in the bible, Christ clearly said it, very clearly, we don’t read bible that way,

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.892
that’s why. That Nicodemus, you see, He told Nicodemus that you are to be born again.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:51.892
So, Nicodemus said that does that mean that I should enter into the womb of my mother.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:59.892
He said no, that is flesh, and the flesh is born out of, whatever is born out of flesh is flesh.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:07.892
You are to be born of your Spirit. And whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit He said.

00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:19.892
But how many people follow that? That’s the consciousness I’m talking of, the real Selfhood.

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:28.892
What we do, in the churches, or in our Indian, any one of the religions that we have.

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.892
We put the water on the head, now you are baptized, you are a Christian.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.892
For a Hindu they put a string, now you are a Brahmin, without knowing a word about Brahma.

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:44.892
[INAUDIBLE]. So now, there is reality.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.892
All these people didn’t tell us lies you see, never told us lies.

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.892
But the truth is always covered by the intellectuals, by the intelligent people on one side

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.892
and by the fanatics on the other side, and that’s why the problem comes in.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:14.892
Q6. [INAUDIBLE]

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:19.892
A6. You see, because, what happens that intellectuals rationalize it.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.892
They say whatever we see, we see the science, so we don’t want to believe.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.892
Now recently there has been a controversy about Christ miracles, isn’t it.

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:38.892
There, lets take this thing very recently, there’s a controversy about Christ’s being born of a virgin.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:44.892
He was born of a virgin, no doubt, but how can you convince an intellectual you see,

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.892
because He cannot be born of a virgin. But He was born.

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.892
All these miracles are absolute truth, no doubt.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.892
So the problem is they want to see through science. Now science is analytical,

00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.892
it is not does the synthesis. Science deals with the dead.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.892
It deadens everything, it analyzes, and whatever you see you think it’s the truth, no,

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:13.892
but it’s just a part of the truth. Now why do they accept?

00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.892
See now, big challenge, is intellectual. This was Mr Paul, who came in.

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.892
When I was a child I asked My father, who is this Paul?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.892
My father, being a very great realized soul himself, he said, he was another mad man.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:38.892
And this Paul had never seen Christ. What we call, he had a supraconscious,

00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.892
a kind of a [CONDITION or POSITION?], he got blind and all that.

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.892
And then he became, he was a horrible man, he killed so many Jews,

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:50.892
he killed the young boys for [STEALING?] you know he did all sorts of things and then suddenly,

00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.892
he becomes a big Christian. Because he saw some sort of a political thing in that.

00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.892
So what does he say, he doesn’t talk of Christ as He was, he talks of a Christ

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.892
which was the church Christ, the Christ of the church.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.892
Now, Christ of the church has nothing to do with real Christ, has nothing to do.

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.892
So now, because they have to accept, the churches have to accept Paul,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.892
they cannot accept Christ. It’s a good idea. Either accept Christ, or accept,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.892
this is what happens with intellectuals. Even in India it has happened.

00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:34.892
I’ll tell you when, when Adi Shankaracharya, he wrote a book called Viviketurya.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.892
It’s a great treatise. About Athvaida [BEST GUESS] he said that God is everything,

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:48.892
Brahma is everything. A beautiful treatise he wrote. So there was a fellow called Vishra,

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.892
Mandan Vishra [BEST GUESS], is a great learned man, another intellectual,

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.892
he came to argue with him. And he argued and argued and argued,

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.892
you see with argument where do you reach? You cannot by arguing give realization to somebody.

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:06.892
And he said, “Why don’t you take your realization?” But he argued,

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.892
he said “You defeat me.” He said “I don’t want to defeat you I want to give you realization,

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.892
why don’t you take your realization?” He would not take the realization.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.892
So, the intellectual, you see, tortured his life. He was so fed up, Adi Shankaracharya.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.892
The book he wrote was Saundarya Lahiri, if you ever happen to read it,

00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:33.892
it’s nothing but the praise of the Mother, throughout. He said this is how [SANSKRIT]

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.892
not by yoga by Sankara [BEST GUESS] by discussion, it’s only through Mother’s grace

00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.892
you are going to get realization [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.892
So the intellectuals, you see, want to derive a pleasure of an intellectual feat out of most if it.

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:58.892
It’s not the real that they are seeking. They read, a lot, achieve nothing.

00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.892
I have known people who are very learned, who have written many books

00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:10.892
and they are so horribly immoral within their private life you can’t believe it that they could be philosophers.

00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.892
And you don’t understand, how can you be, why are you so hypocritical? But they are.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.892
Because they are not realized souls. And an ordinary person, you find a realized soul.

00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:30.892
Just uneducated. That’s why Kabira has said Pari Pari Pundita Mura Kabai,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:40.892
by reading too much you learned have become stupid. But I don’t say all learned are stupid.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:48.892
No. But learning should reach that supreme power of intelligence, which is pure intelligence.

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.892
Then obviously you see the thing and you accept if you are honest as I said in the beginning.

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.892
You must have that pure intelligence to see, God is there.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:03.892
He’s above everything, he’s above your intelligence, above your thoughts.

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:09.892
You have to feel him first, you have to rise. That is the transformation, if you cannot achieve,

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:17.892
then how can I talk to you? If a person is blind,

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:24.892
what’s the use of talking about colors to a blind person, what does he understand?

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:30.892
He can’t even see whether I’m smiling or laughing or if I’m crying. What can you talk?

00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.892
So the eyes must be open, and these eyes which I’m talking of are above your thought.

00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:42.892
You cannot by your projection get it.

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:51.892
It has to come to you. It’s a grace. Ashedvard [BEST GUESS].

00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:59.892
Q7. [INAUDIBLE]

00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:05.892
A7. No You see what I would suggest that what happens that once you get your realisation

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.892
then I have seen a person who has developed the intellect,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:17.892
understands it in an intellectual way what realization is

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:25.892
and a person who is not supposed to be so intelligent starts talking like saints.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.892
I had gone to a village in India and there was a person who was, I was going on a bullock cart,

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.892
he was driving Me and I asked him when he did you get your realization

00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:40.892
and then he started talking to Me. I said “Kabira is driving Me or what?”

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:48.892
How is he talking like this?” The truth, tremendous, what intelligence.

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.892
How much Christ studied in what university?

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:03.892
So we should not misunderstand intelligence I mean the divine intelligence,

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.892
that’s a very different thing.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:25.892
Q8. [INAUDIBLE]

00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:32.892
A8. You are, all the time, if you, Shaktipad [BEST GUESS] is the word they use it,

00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.892
Shaktipad you see, but it is very much misused. Shaktipad means people start dancing like mad,

00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.892
they start shouting screaming how can that be Shaktipad? That’s madness, that’s possession,

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:51.892
you get possessed. Shaktipad means if somebody is a Shakti,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:56.892
you see the Shakti of that person enters into your being and invites your Kundalini

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:59.892
so the Kundalini rises. That’s what actually it is

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.892
and then the Kundalini rises and makes you a beautiful person

00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.892
it doesn’t make you a mad person no how can it be?

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.892
Just imagine now after evolving yourself from amoeba and all the donkeys

00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:22.892
and all the monkeys and what else, oh, cockroaches are you going to become a mad person?

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:27.892
Or a frog, jumping like that.

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:32.892
So this is very much, that’s why I don’t use very much Shaktipad power because these days

00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.892
every Dick, Tom and Harry is using you see. Shaktipad that’s not what I mean.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.892
Shaktipad means if somebody has Shakti it just works.

00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:48.892
You don’t go and put it in the head of that person, it just flows, all right?

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.892
But it was used in Patanjali’s day in that way but who reads Patanjali? Nobody reads I think

00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:00.892
nobody reads and talks about it. What they talk is some sort of a head standing

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.892
some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE SHEERSH] asana that’s all. I mean that’s we, we, we, part of it.

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:11.892
Nobody reads him I mean if you read it, I mean, [INAUDIBLE] you see what he has written is

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.892
that’s what I am doing. I am quite surprised how people talk about this thing.

00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:24.892
What he says you achieve [SANSKRIT] means you become effortless

00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.892
first [SANSKRIT] you become without thoughtless,

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:37.892
then the third thing he says you become complete negation of thought, [SANSKRIT].

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:44.892
But here it is they are all jumping, talking big, this, that, how can that be?

00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:50.892
Meditation means jumping in the air, how can it be? [HINDI]

00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.892
Indians understand thank God, Indians are that way you see, safe.

00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.892
But there should be seeking in India. You see these people are seeking

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.892
and striving and they are the ones who want it, I must tell you very frankly

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.892
they are the people who really are nicely seeking, in England I am saying not in India.

00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:21.892
But Indians are not seeking that, but they have one great thing in them is that they know what is reality.

00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.892
They understand. You see like some of the people who went to a Guru,

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.892
I must tell you, and he gave them a mantra for which he charged £300 in secret, in the ears,

00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:44.892
nobody to be told. And the mantra was “Tinga”. “Tinga” and they told Me in the ear

00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:52.892
and I couldn’t help laughing, “Tinga” means showing like this to someone.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.892
And he used to giggle at people because they were all so stupid, poor things,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.892
but they were seekers, real seekers, you know,

00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:08.892
of such high quality and this fellow who told Me was a barrister can you imagine?

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:24.892
Q9. [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.892
A9. Yes, you are part, you are part of the whole. You are part and parcel of the whole.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.892
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm,

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.892
as we say in Sanskrit is Virata, you become part and parcel of that Virata.

00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:56.892
Q10. [INAUDIBLE]

00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.892
A10. No, no, no. [INAUDIBLE] Correct.

00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:10.892
See it may look like that because the myth of responsibility drops out.

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:17.892
Supposing, this wire thinks that it is responsible for what I am speaking,

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:25.892
does it become more efficient? Say, what responsibility we have is like this.

00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:31.892
When we are going by a plane, question is very good, I have seen it. I mean actually,

00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:37.892
it must be understood in its full context it’s correct that when you think it is the responsibility of God

00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:40.892
you see, then you become irresponsible.

00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.892
On the contrary, you become an instrument into his hands you see.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.892
But you don’t think that you are doing it yourself, like you are sitting in the play.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.892
I give this example many a times because I have seen this happen.

00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.892
Some villagers never knew how to go by plane so they were told not to take too much luggage.

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.892
They sat in the plane and put all their luggage on their heads.

00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:08.892
Carrying the responsibility of the plane, saying that we have to carry the load

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.892
because we don’t want the plane to carry all our loads you see.

00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:18.892
So that myth drops out, that myth drops out.

00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:21.892
But you become a very efficient person

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:27.892
because the energy that’s divine starts dynamically working, manifesting.

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:31.892
You become a dynamic person, you can do a thousand and one things

00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:35.892
which you have never done before, because you have become a perfect instrument.

00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:45.892
You are not perfect as long as you think you are doing it, you see My point?

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:59.892
All of them, those who are realised souls, and you will be too.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.892
What work are they doing, is spiritually they are doing a lot of work, now,

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.892
that’s another side when you’ll come to Sahaja Yoga we’ll tell you what work they are doing.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:14.892
You see what work you want us to do may not be the work that we are doing

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.892
but we are transforming people. We are saving people from cancers and so many diseases,

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:24.892
we are transforming them, we are changing them so much that they have given up drugs.

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:30.892
So many people have given up alcohol, all these bad habits have dropped out.

00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.892
So many people are cured of so many diseases, so many diseases we have cured already,

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.892
when you come to us we will let you know as to what substantial work it is. all right?

00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:47.892
Starvation of course, our starvation. Why people are starving also

00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.892
because I think people who drink are starving because they waste their money in drink.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:57.892
If they haven’t, if they have money why should they drink?

00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.892
If they don’t have money why should they drink? But most of the people starve themselves

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.892
because they spend all their money, in UK I am saying, not in India, India is a different thing.

00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:13.892
But in India people who have got realization are blessed they don’t starve anymore.

00:24:14.000 --> 00:28:29.892
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:37.892
first you get your yoga, your union with God and then I will bless you. Kshema.

00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:41.892
[INAUDIBLE]

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.892
Yes, yes, of course, of course you can pay your rates, everything,

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:50.892
but you just come and see before. This is the intellectual side, come inside and see,

00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:56.892
whether it works out or not. Why not see? Don’t argue for arguments sake, it works out.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.892
There’s somebody sitting behind you who has, in his life it has worked out, just behind.

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:09.892
In many lives it has worked out but you come and see for yourself what miracles it has, all right?

00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.892
You come and see all previous things just drop off.

00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:18.892
Come and see how God is blissful after all the blessings come from God.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.892
But we don’t want to do anything for God and why not God look after us,

00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:32.892
what have you done for God so far. Can I ask a question?

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:42.892
Everyone has right to ask a question to Me, I better ask you all. What have you done for God?

00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:59.892
Just surrender it. [INAUDIBLE] You are afraid? [INAUDIBLE] Afraid of God? [INAUDIBLE] Pray?

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:06.892
But what we pray to God is “Give me my food. Give me a job.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:19.892
God get me this. Let me win this war. Let’s kill my enemies” I know all those prayers.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:44.892
Q11. [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:51.892
A11. First you get connected all right. First let us get connected then you will know.

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:56.892
Then you will know what He wants and what He does.

00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.892
Then you will know He is very kind man, very kind,

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.892
extremely forgiving that the way He has forgiven us for whatever we have done.

00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.892
But don’t feel guilty for it, that’s one thing I didn’t want to start,

00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.892
because you see that’s one trouble you all have is to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel guilty

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.892
because realization doesn’t work out.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:29.892
Don’t feel guilty it’s all right. We’ll have it next time madam, is it something important?

00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:56.892
Q12. [INAUDIBLE]

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.892
A12. Talk. Talking is not the thing,

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:05.892
you see what I would say you should see the way they talk has nothing to do,

00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:09.892
what you have to see, what have you achieved yourself.

00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.892
Whatever people may talk is they might be talking because they are possessed, that’s all.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:23.892
If somebody talks big be careful, be careful, the one who does, isn’t.

00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.892
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head is the point I said that nobody can do,

00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.892
can anybody do that?

00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.000
They don’t need anything, it is said that Yoga Kshema Wiam Miam,

00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:43.892
Those who talk can be good actors at the most, at the worst they are possessed. [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:54.892
Q13. [INAUDIBLE]

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.892
A13. Your married life improves immensely.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:05.892
Because you will learn later on there is a centre for it and you understand your married life as a bliss,

00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:11.892
it’s absolutely pure blessings to married people. Actually you will be surprised

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:14.892
we can’t give realization to people who are not married, in the sense

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:22.892
who are going to marry is all right. But those who are against marriage we can’t give realization

00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:25.892
because they are a little imbalanced.

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:34.892
I think the one we had you see, we couldn’t give realization, I hope he’s not here.

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.892
But he is going to get married so we will give him realization,

00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:44.892
we just couldn’t give him, but married life improves like this.

00:29:45.000 --> 00:30:04.892
Q14. [INAUDIBLE]

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:17.892
A 14. What is it about Bhagwan? [HINDI]

00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:27.892
This kind of a Bhagwan, who cannot even smell a flower. Can you think of a Bhagwan like that?

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.892
You know in the Devi Mahatmayam or into the Vishnu Shastranama,

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:40.892
or anyone of them where there is a described God at least twenty five names of God is he’s fond of flower, fragrance, flower.

00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.892
I can’t live without flowers and the fellow who cannot smell a flower [HINDI]

00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:52.892
I mean what do you give him? Phenyl or something?

00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:12.892
This is one of the tests. How can you be a Bhagwan? [SANSKRIT] These are the names of God.

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:33.892
Q15. [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:38.892
A15. You see, say now if I give you Indian money say 100 rupees how do you know it is 100 rupees?

00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.892
You have to go to India and spend it and see if it works out or not.

00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:47.892
In the same way when you get the vibrations and you feel the cool breeze you spend it

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.892
and see for yourself and judge it.

00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.892
You can do the whole process yourself, you can give realization to others all right?

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.892
You see now I would say please get your realization, if you get it, I don’t promise, if you get it.

00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:15.892
That’s a very big if, sometimes. I know it happens if you get it

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:21.892
then you have to go and see for yourself whether it works or not.

00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:27.892
But to get it is not easy in certain cases,

00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:34.892
so be cheerful about it and be patient with yourself.

00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.892
More patience is needed with yourself, not with Me because I am extremely patient.

00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:43.892
You have to be patient with yourself because your mind will be coming up and always saying something,

00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:47.892
you didn’t ask this question, you should have asked this question, tell your mind to be quiet.

00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.892
Take your realization, lets see if it works out.

00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:59.892
We cannot assure, it may, it may not, it’s your luck, that’s it.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:27.892
Q16. [INAUDIBLE]

00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.892
A16. This conscious mind that you have just now is the human awareness, all right,

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:39.892
at this point the human awareness is at such a stage, that you are not connected with your spirit.

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.892
First your human awareness has to be raised it has to be brought to that point

00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:47.892
where you get connected. Like this instrument is here now,

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:51.892
consciously whatever you do with this it is not connected, it has no meaning.

00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.892
In the same way first you should be connected.

00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.892
After connecting only we can see where is the problem is, what is missing, what is it

00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:03.892
and is to be done. So we have to take a very reasonable attitude towards it,

00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.892
about ourselves, to understand that maybe there is something missing,

00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:12.892
something is happening, it’s not working out.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:19.892
Because at this awareness, at this consciousness that you have, this human consciousness is not sufficient.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.892
So you have to jump, there’s a breakthrough, and you have to achieve that breakthrough.

00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.892
Which I will not promise, as I told that gentleman there you, it cannot be promised,

00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:35.892
it has to be achieved. If you get it then you have to have patience with yourself work it out and see for yourself.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:47.892
Q17. [INAUDIBLE]

00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:50.892
A17. Yes They did because that was the time you see.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:53.892
Now Jesus came at a time when our Agnya chakra was opened,

00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:02.892
see it’s like a Tree of Life has to grow you see and They come at a proper time what has to grow.

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.892
Now if it’s the root time and somebody else came in, when the shoot started

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.892
somebody else came in gradually it has come up to this point. Now Mohammed,

00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:13.892
what Mohamed has said, nobody says that today.

00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:18.892
All the Muslims must know that He said “At the time of the resurrection your hands must speak”,

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:24.892
where is that? He said it I mean nobody else but Mohammed had said so clearly about it.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:31.892
And what does He say is not known nobody knows why He said [INAUDIBLE-namas] like this.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.892
Nobody asked questions, why do you follow?

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:38.892
But after Sahaja yoga will know what [INAUDIBLE] what Mohammed means,

00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.892
who He was and why He said so what is so important about it.

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:48.892
You can’t understand even Mohammed or anyone, Jesus or anyone, without realization

00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:54.892
because you have not entered into that rank, you see My point.

00:35:55.000 --> 00:36:00.892
Because the time that time was not to say whatever They had to do They did very important work very, very important.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.892
Every one of Them have worked very hard.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:12.892
Only I must say that today I am at an advantage than They are

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:21.892
because so many are getting self-realization. They had a very bad time.

00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:28.892
They had a very bad time nobody accepted Them. All acceptance came later on when

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:31.892
They were not there and people liked to have such acceptance

00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:36.892
because they can do what they like. They don’t want to,

00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.892
nobody asked Them for realization at that time, nobody, everybody tried just to kill Them.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:49.892
I mean everybody was anxious how to get rid of Them, isn’t it a fact?

00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.892
Like today as there are so many who want their realization that time was not there.

00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:58.892
Today is the time, all right?

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:29.892
Q18. [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.892
A18. You see that you don’t even need one minute for that, to say, “I’m born again”

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:39.892
it is all self-opinionated thing, just to say. But you have to have powers you see

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.892
that’s what I told you the whole lecture was like that.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.892
That once you get self realised you get the powers you have collective consciousness you become conscious.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.892
You see it is very easy to say, just to put the, I don’t know how much they pay

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:57.892
but you just put the name membership “I’m born again”. You don’t know this born again people,

00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.892
horribly hot tempered, useless people absolutely. You see some of them brought some bibles

00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:06.892
and one lady bearing all artificial jewellery here and there and she came to give Me the bible

00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:12.892
and I just ignored her. I just started laughing and she was quite surprised to hear this sound.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.892
So this is what born again how can they be born again if they can’t make out a saint.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.892
How can they be born again? [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:44.892
Only the truth will survive. All these are fads and things [INAUDIBLE] it has no meaning.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.000
END
