00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:03.959
Shivaratri Puja, Pune,
17 March 2002.

00:00:04.792 --> 00:00:13.959
Tonight we have gathered here to do Shri Shiva Puja.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.041
Those people who have a clean heart can only do Shiva Puja.

00:00:34.542 --> 00:00:42.208
Those whose heart is not clean cannot do Shiva Puja.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.166
It's a simple principle of Shri Shivaratri.

00:01:01.083 --> 00:01:06.166
As you have seen yesterday, we have snakes,

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:11.792
or, these are horrible snakes

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.291
guiding behind the Shiva Linga.

00:01:23.125 --> 00:01:30.625
The significance is this - those who are clean in heart,

00:01:35.041 --> 00:01:38.291
who are full of love for others,

00:01:41.291 --> 00:01:51.125
are always guarded by the power of Shiva,

00:01:51.375 --> 00:01:54.041
which are the snakes.

00:01:55.291 --> 00:02:02.041
It's a symbolic thing, to say, very symbolic.

00:02:03.041 --> 00:02:07.375
But I must say that animals understand

00:02:08.041 --> 00:02:14.208
Divine force much better than human beings, much better.

00:02:15.625 --> 00:02:18.625
Because they have a clean heart.

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:28.875
Whatever is their lifestyle built by nature,

00:02:29.291 --> 00:02:30.875
they carry on with it.

00:02:31.291 --> 00:02:37.166
But there's no malice, there's no jealousy,

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:42.208
there's not all these mean things in their heart.

00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:45.667
They do it because it is supposed to be.

00:02:48.041 --> 00:02:53.291
But the quality of human beings is only one

00:02:54.375 --> 00:02:59.667
- and that is how much they love and forgive.

00:03:02.041 --> 00:03:07.500
Loving capacity of human beings are such by

00:03:07.875 --> 00:03:12.041
which they conquer all their negative forces -

00:03:12.125 --> 00:03:16.500
they can, easily, see that it's not good

00:03:17.041 --> 00:03:19.667
to have all these qualities,

00:03:20.041 --> 00:03:24.291
or maybe that they understand it's not noble

00:03:24.375 --> 00:03:30.041
to indulge into all these inhuman behaviour.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:39.667
They are not bound to indulge into all these things.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:49.041
Neither they are asked to be,

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:59.959
but suddenly they get lured by such things which has got hatred,

00:04:00.291 --> 00:04:08.291
jealousy and greed.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.125
You see how Shiva lives.

00:04:15.542 --> 00:04:17.375
He lives in the Himalayas.

00:04:18.792 --> 00:04:23.792
See what clothes He wears, what He eats.

00:04:24.208 --> 00:04:30.375
He has no demand for anything because He's complete, He's perfect.

00:04:33.792 --> 00:04:38.000
Such a personality is Shiva's.

00:04:38.375 --> 00:04:42.208
And if you are worshipping Him,

00:04:42.291 --> 00:04:46.000
you should find out within your heart

00:04:46.542 --> 00:04:56.041
what sort of feelings you have, what sort of malice you nurture.

00:04:56.125 --> 00:05:02.542
These days in India, greed has become the main point.

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:07.834
They are so mean and so low.

00:05:10.041 --> 00:05:18.166
Which impossible to understand that they think money is everything,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.041
which is not in the culture of Indians, no, no.

00:05:24.375 --> 00:05:26.041
In no way.

00:05:26.375 --> 00:05:29.959
But somehow they have picked it up,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.542
in the foreign countries perhaps,

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:35.375
and it is spreading very much now,

00:05:35.667 --> 00:05:38.542
that money is the most important thing.

00:05:40.208 --> 00:05:41.959
Think of Shiva.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.208
He never thought of money.

00:05:48.291 --> 00:05:51.208
He never wanted any money.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.291
He never wanted to show off himself.

00:05:58.667 --> 00:06:03.834
There is such a difference between Shiva and Shakti.

00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:07.208
In their whole attitude.

00:06:07.291 --> 00:06:12.625
Because Shiva is absolutely a liberated personality,

00:06:12.834 --> 00:06:14.625
he's not bothered.

00:06:16.208 --> 00:06:17.667
If the people

00:06:17.875 --> 00:06:21.166
are indulging into wrong things, he'll destroy - finished!

00:06:23.542 --> 00:06:24.959
He doesn't want to cure,

00:06:25.166 --> 00:06:27.542
He doesn't want to improve, nothing of the kind.

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.959
But for the Shakti it is important,

00:06:31.041 --> 00:06:35.959
because this is Her child, this universe is Her child.

00:06:36.041 --> 00:06:39.125
All this is created by Her,

00:06:39.166 --> 00:06:41.792
so naturally She is worried

00:06:42.166 --> 00:06:44.333
and She doesn't like people

00:06:44.625 --> 00:06:48.834
who try to take to mean things and nonsense.

00:06:52.208 --> 00:06:58.959
First of all it was human beings started indulging in power.

00:07:00.041 --> 00:07:05.125
They moved from countries to country to empower themselves.

00:07:05.166 --> 00:07:07.291
Where is that power gone? Finished.

00:07:09.709 --> 00:07:14.417
Then, after that, what happened with them

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:19.709
is that they left their style with others.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:24.125
And now it seems

00:07:24.166 --> 00:07:28.834
it is very common to see people shamelessly being greedy.

00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.542
For them, is the solution, is Shiva.

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.333
All such people will be destroyed. First of all

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:47.709
they will be exposed and then they will be destroyed,

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:50.542
to the last bit of it.

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.333
Another thing is that

00:07:56.709 --> 00:08:02.458
Shiva respects a person who has a good character;

00:08:02.834 --> 00:08:05.834
a person with a good character.

00:08:07.208 --> 00:08:11.333
And if anyone is bad charactered

00:08:13.125 --> 00:08:20.458
or indulges into bad things, Shiva won't spare them.

00:08:21.834 --> 00:08:29.041
So the Shakti creates, protects, looks after them, brings them up.

00:08:29.458 --> 00:08:33.709
But Shiva is sitting there, just to destroy!

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:40.709
Very important, this destruction is very important.

00:08:41.125 --> 00:08:44.125
The Shakti doesn't show those qualities.

00:08:44.166 --> 00:08:46.333
She may destroy some rakshasas,

00:08:46.709 --> 00:08:50.166
but He can destroy nations after nations.

00:08:51.625 --> 00:08:59.125
First of all the ego you have - who will destroy that?

00:08:59.208 --> 00:09:05.458
, Shiva. Shiva is in your Sahasrara.

00:09:05.875 --> 00:09:08.125
He is sitting in the Sahasrara;

00:09:08.208 --> 00:09:11.709
now remember, on top of everything.

00:09:13.875 --> 00:09:25.291
The other day I saw one gentleman from the Broadcasting, a newsman,

00:09:25.333 --> 00:09:32.291
who was very, very stupid and was talking very harshly.

00:09:33.875 --> 00:09:39.625
And I saw his Ekadesha coming up: "My God" I said,

00:09:40.458 --> 00:09:44.458
"This one is now going to be in trouble."

00:09:44.875 --> 00:09:50.125
What is Ekadesha is nothing but the eleven powers of Shiva.

00:09:50.208 --> 00:09:53.500
They build up here

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:56.667
and give you all kinds of diseases;

00:09:56.834 --> 00:10:00.000
the worst of all is cancer.

00:10:00.041 --> 00:10:04.875
And I knew that this fellow is going to have a very bad time.

00:10:05.291 --> 00:10:09.166
But he is not a Sahaja Yogi, how am I to tell him?

00:10:09.208 --> 00:10:11.208
How anybody has to tell him?

00:10:12.625 --> 00:10:16.041
But it comes from this Ekadesha Rudra.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:21.625
Now these are eleven powers of Shiva, very well described.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.166
Now these powers start working on people,

00:10:26.208 --> 00:10:28.208
even on Sahaja Yogis,

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.875
if they do not follow the principle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:39.166
He is, I should say, watching everything.

00:10:40.208 --> 00:10:43.291
Every part of your life He watches.

00:10:45.291 --> 00:10:50.333
How you behave, what you do, what is your dharma

00:10:50.792 --> 00:10:52.625
- He watches all that.

00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000
And so many saints have warned you,

00:10:57.125 --> 00:11:00.333
so many incarnations have warned you;

00:11:00.792 --> 00:11:04.458
but I tell you if you don't listen to them,

00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:08.208
then Shiva is not going to listen.

00:11:08.625 --> 00:11:10.875
He doesn't listen to anyone.

00:11:13.291 --> 00:11:14.875
If he's angry, he's angry.

00:11:15.291 --> 00:11:19.375
Whatever it is, very difficult to convince Him

00:11:19.792 --> 00:11:24.917
that 'Please spare this person, it's alright. Forgive.

00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.125
' But his basic quality is forgiveness,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:32.500
can you imagine? His basic quality is forgiveness.

00:11:32.875 --> 00:11:38.875
But if He doesn't forgive, then you are finished.

00:11:40.875 --> 00:11:45.375
Up to a point maybe He might forgive, but after that..

00:11:45.792 --> 00:11:50.166
It's a very, very difficult situation.

00:11:50.208 --> 00:11:55.166
And I find that people don't realise

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:57.792
what Shiva is.

00:11:59.166 --> 00:12:02.709
In the south we have two types of people worshipers.

00:12:02.875 --> 00:12:05.500
One are shaivaites, another vaishnavaites.

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:09.208
They are having a big fight with each other.

00:12:09.667 --> 00:12:11.375
Now it is less, much less.

00:12:11.792 --> 00:12:17.667
What is the work of Vishnu is to give you realisation,

00:12:18.041 --> 00:12:21.792
emancipation of human beings, evolution of human beings.

00:12:23.166 --> 00:12:31.291
But if you fail in your goodness, in your dharma,

00:12:31.375 --> 00:12:36.959
then Shiva comes in your life.

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:40.667
We have to understand

00:12:40.875 --> 00:12:44.667
[that] we are all surrounded by their powers,

00:12:45.041 --> 00:12:47.792
we are all made by their powers.

00:12:49.166 --> 00:12:53.166
It's the Shakti who is protecting you.

00:12:53.291 --> 00:12:59.792
But to an extent. She cannot go above Shiva,

00:13:02.208 --> 00:13:04.375
She cannot cross Him.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:12.792
These days you find so many people indulging into politics

00:13:13.208 --> 00:13:15.375
- it's all money-making propositions.

00:13:16.792 --> 00:13:21.291
They all try to make money, it's not politics!

00:13:21.375 --> 00:13:26.375
They don't do any good to the whole communities, nowhere.

00:13:26.792 --> 00:13:31.041
Either under fear or under abandonment.

00:13:31.125 --> 00:13:38.375
They behave in such a manner that they are not afraid of God,

00:13:38.792 --> 00:13:45.375
they are not afraid of His own attention on people.

00:13:46.792 --> 00:13:51.291
Perhaps they don't know that they are under the attention of Shiva.

00:13:53.166 --> 00:13:55.166
He's watching each and every person,

00:13:57.041 --> 00:14:01.834
whether you are Australian, English or Indian.

00:14:03.208 --> 00:14:09.291
Whatever religion you may follow, He's watching them.

00:14:09.959 --> 00:14:13.166
This is a thing one has to understand.

00:14:14.542 --> 00:14:16.542
And once you understand this,

00:14:17.959 --> 00:14:23.208
you will accept that you have to be good and dharmic people.

00:14:23.667 --> 00:14:26.166
You have to be good-charactered people.

00:14:27.542 --> 00:14:30.834
Why people talk of good character?

00:14:31.208 --> 00:14:33.166
Try to understand!

00:14:33.542 --> 00:14:37.542
It's stupidity these days when people don't believe in it.

00:14:39.959 --> 00:14:41.959
People are doing all kinds of things,

00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:52.125
they are drinking, they are playing this...money business.

00:14:52.542 --> 00:14:54.667
All kinds of things they are doing

00:14:54.959 --> 00:15:03.959
without having any fear of the wrath of God.

00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:07.166
And that wrath comes from Shiva.

00:15:08.542 --> 00:15:10.166
I would like to warn you all,

00:15:10.542 --> 00:15:13.458
though you are all my children - be careful!

00:15:14.834 --> 00:15:17.291
Try to weigh every step that you take.

00:15:19.709 --> 00:15:22.041
Of course I am there to support you, to help you,

00:15:22.250 --> 00:15:23.166
to protect you.

00:15:23.542 --> 00:15:26.709
But, not beyond Shiva,

00:15:28.125 --> 00:15:29.709
I can't go beyond Him.

00:15:31.125 --> 00:15:39.959
It's such a power of Shiva, it's such an authority of Shiva.

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:45.458
And to worship Him means to worship goodness in you.

00:15:47.709 --> 00:15:53.125
The goodness could be compassion, could be love,

00:15:53.166 --> 00:15:55.959
could be forgiveness, anything.

00:15:56.041 --> 00:15:58.166
He likes only good people,

00:15:58.542 --> 00:16:01.166
and He will protect only good people.

00:16:01.542 --> 00:16:06.333
For example, some people are very power oriented,

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:11.208
some are money oriented and some are power oriented.

00:16:11.333 --> 00:16:15.542
And the power oriented also do it for money sometimes,

00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.542
that's the aim.

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.834
They'll not stay in Sahaj.

00:16:21.208 --> 00:16:23.834
They will be displaced.

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:26.041
They do it, [and] then come and ask for forgiveness,

00:16:26.458 --> 00:16:29.333
"Oh Mother forgive us, we have done it".

00:16:29.709 --> 00:16:33.166
But try not to do anything of that kind.

00:16:33.333 --> 00:16:39.166
I, of course, forgive you, but Shiva, He won't, He won't.

00:16:41.625 --> 00:16:43.125
He will take you to task

00:16:43.166 --> 00:16:44.375
and then you will come to Me "Mother,

00:16:44.667 --> 00:16:47.041
You must save us!" It's very difficult.

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:51.125
From His clutches it is very difficult.

00:16:51.166 --> 00:16:54.458
Also He's a very forgiving person.

00:16:54.834 --> 00:16:58.125
He forgives you, many things.

00:16:58.208 --> 00:17:01.333
Because of Me also He forgives.

00:17:01.709 --> 00:17:04.834
But, after some time when He takes over,

00:17:06.125 --> 00:17:09.458
there's no appeal, there's no safety.

00:17:09.875 --> 00:17:12.458
I do not want to frighten you,

00:17:12.875 --> 00:17:16.208
but I want to tell you the truth, it is the truth.

00:17:16.625 --> 00:17:19.875
You have to try to be good people.

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:27.041
You have to try to be really good-charactered people.

00:17:27.458 --> 00:17:31.333
I am told some people who are in Sahaja Yoga

00:17:31.709 --> 00:17:37.333
indulge in money laundering and all that.

00:17:38.125 --> 00:17:41.041
Also some of them have very bad characters,

00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:43.458
they run after girls

00:17:43.792 --> 00:17:48.291
and they try to look at the girls and all sorts of things.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:53.208
Now this has ruined the west especially.

00:17:53.625 --> 00:17:57.000
Also our Indians are learning from them.

00:17:59.041 --> 00:18:03.000
As it is, we have to respect ourselves.

00:18:03.041 --> 00:18:09.333
If we don't respect ourselves, and we try to misbehave,

00:18:13.166 --> 00:18:17.709
I can only help you with your Kundalini.

00:18:19.500 --> 00:18:24.000
But if you go too much beyond it,

00:18:24.125 --> 00:18:27.500
Ekadesha Rudra will catch, no doubt.

00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:35.166
It's a very big barrier on your forehead.

00:18:36.208 --> 00:18:45.125
Ekadasha Rudra, and it is so effective nowadays, so much active.

00:18:45.500 --> 00:18:49.917
All kinds of diseases which are coming out, is all incurable,

00:18:50.250 --> 00:18:52.333
are because of Ekadesha.

00:18:54.792 --> 00:19:02.000
And also those who are suffering from possessions.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.625
The other day I met somebody who was very much caught-up.

00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:13.208
And the Ekadesha was working.

00:19:13.625 --> 00:19:19.083
I found out that he is very fanatically

00:19:19.291 --> 00:19:24.000
influenced by something.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.291
I don't want to name it,

00:19:28.625 --> 00:19:34.625
but these, we have found out, are not correct things.

00:19:36.041 --> 00:19:38.083
In every religion we have

00:19:38.375 --> 00:19:42.375
people who are spreading nonsensical ideas.

00:19:42.792 --> 00:19:46.291
Now if you don't have discretion about it,

00:19:46.375 --> 00:19:48.208
nobody can help you.

00:19:48.625 --> 00:19:51.208
You should have a full discretion

00:19:51.625 --> 00:19:57.291
as to what is right and what is wrong.

00:20:00.375 --> 00:20:03.792
Then Shiva is with you.

00:20:04.166 --> 00:20:06.583
But if you indulge

00:20:06.875 --> 00:20:14.166
into all such nonsensical things, it is self-destructive, I must say

00:20:14.208 --> 00:20:19.500
But to the Self which is destructive is the power of Shiva.

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:25.500
What we call the Self here, is the power of Shiva.

00:20:27.875 --> 00:20:31.500
He destroys by many things, by many things.

00:20:33.875 --> 00:20:36.375
You can lose your reputation,

00:20:36.792 --> 00:20:39.375
you can lose your health,

00:20:40.792 --> 00:20:43.792
you can lose your wealth,

00:20:45.208 --> 00:20:47.166
everything can happen to you

00:20:47.375 --> 00:20:51.291
till you are completely finished and fagged out.

00:20:56.166 --> 00:20:58.875
I have known people on the death-bed also,

00:20:59.166 --> 00:21:02.166
start talking about money,

00:21:02.208 --> 00:21:05.250
'What should she get, money, how will he get money,

00:21:05.583 --> 00:21:06.667
and this and that'.

00:21:08.041 --> 00:21:10.083
Instead of talking about God

00:21:10.375 --> 00:21:13.875
or Self Realisation, they are talking like this.

00:21:15.667 --> 00:21:18.125
It's such a noble thing.

00:21:19.166 --> 00:21:24.500
But if you see Shiva, He doesn't possess anything,

00:21:24.959 --> 00:21:26.792
He doesn't want anything.

00:21:29.166 --> 00:21:31.041
Whatever you give to him,

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:33.792
as a samarpana or anything,

00:21:34.166 --> 00:21:41.667
that He doesn't accept, and He passes on to the Shakti,

00:21:42.041 --> 00:21:44.041
"You do what you want to do."

00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:48.959
She's the one who is working out everything

00:21:49.291 --> 00:21:55.375
to benefit you to make you happy. He's not bothered.

00:21:55.792 --> 00:21:59.792
In this case, you have to please Shiva!

00:22:00.208 --> 00:22:02.667
He will not try to please you,

00:22:03.041 --> 00:22:06.041
you have to go all the way to please Him.

00:22:06.125 --> 00:22:10.792
It is a very difficult personality of Shiva.

00:22:13.208 --> 00:22:18.375
In the Koran, it is not written separately

00:22:18.583 --> 00:22:25.291
for Allah or for Shiva or all these it is not differentiated.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.208
Because the people with whom He had to deal

00:22:29.542 --> 00:22:32.208
were all uneducated, stupid people.

00:22:32.291 --> 00:22:34.959
So He didn't give all the details that

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.166
God is in different forms.

00:22:38.542 --> 00:22:41.166
So there is only one Allah they know.

00:22:41.542 --> 00:22:45.208
But they don't know anything that

00:22:45.291 --> 00:22:49.959
shows the differentiations of their jobs and work.

00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:55.959
It is the Shakti who loves, I agree.

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:00.834
But She too, can get angry very much.

00:23:03.208 --> 00:23:06.166
And once She gets angry, there is no end to it!

00:23:09.542 --> 00:23:12.375
Now I have to tell you, as Sahaja Yogis,

00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:17.291
that you develop your qualities to please the Shiva.

00:23:20.667 --> 00:23:27.959
It's too much of hankering, too much of 'wants'.

00:23:30.291 --> 00:23:34.166
All this is not necessary.

00:23:34.542 --> 00:23:38.834
Of course I want you to live well, and beautifully,

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.458
not stupidly - to go into jungles

00:23:42.834 --> 00:23:45.959
or to behave like hippies - that's not the point.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.834
The point is,

00:23:48.208 --> 00:23:56.834
from your heart, the attachment to things must go away.

00:23:57.208 --> 00:24:01.667
A person who is a Shiva Bhakta

00:24:05.125 --> 00:24:07.834
- he doesn't care for money, he doesn't know about money.

00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:14.125
He is a very generous person, extremely. He's just generous.

00:24:14.166 --> 00:24:19.208
People may say, "Stupid"- the way he goes on, the way he works it.

00:24:19.291 --> 00:24:22.458
But I don't think so.

00:24:22.834 --> 00:24:31.166
That's not at all the description.

00:24:35.291 --> 00:24:37.959
The description of a man

00:24:38.291 --> 00:24:45.291
who is a bhakta of Shiva has no interest in money,

00:24:45.709 --> 00:24:47.709
he's very generous.

00:24:48.125 --> 00:24:52.166
Anything you ask from that, he'll give.

00:24:52.542 --> 00:24:55.000
Mahavira's was like that.

00:24:55.041 --> 00:25:01.208
Mahavira had gone for his meditation in his own garden

00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:09.709
and Vishnu as Shri Krishna

00:25:10.125 --> 00:25:11.542
came and told him that,

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.834
"See, I have no clothes.

00:25:14.208 --> 00:25:18.834
You have got this cloth, why don't you give me half of it?"

00:25:19.208 --> 00:25:26.125
He said, "All right, you can have it. You can have the whole. "

00:25:27.208 --> 00:25:33.333
Because he said this, "My house is here, I'll just wear my clothes"

00:25:33.709 --> 00:25:35.834
What he did was not

00:25:36.291 --> 00:25:41.125
to show that nudity is a very great thing.

00:25:41.166 --> 00:25:43.625
But if you see the Jains, what to do,

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:52.125
they make big, big statues of Mahavira

00:25:52.333 --> 00:25:55.125
showing Him completely nude.

00:25:55.166 --> 00:25:58.291
I mean, this is the perversion of human mind.

00:25:59.333 --> 00:26:01.291
Why He did it, we should know.

00:26:01.333 --> 00:26:04.458
He was so detached, so detached. So,

00:26:04.834 --> 00:26:08.208
give away the clothes, what is the harm?

00:26:08.625 --> 00:26:11.125
It was not to show-off or anything.

00:26:11.208 --> 00:26:16.875
But the generosity, people don't understand.

00:26:17.291 --> 00:26:20.625
And the Jainies are the least generous!

00:26:23.333 --> 00:26:30.041
So the quality of all these great incarnations is also not understood.

00:26:30.458 --> 00:26:38.625
Because a kind of an illusion is there.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:46.041
For example, Shiva is always with very few clothes, very few.

00:26:48.458 --> 00:26:52.625
And what does he eat? No-one knows.

00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:58.875
What is his desires and what does he want? No-one knows.

00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:05.125
A person with a great knowledge of music will sing before him,

00:27:05.208 --> 00:27:06.291
He's alright.

00:27:06.333 --> 00:27:10.041
Or even any madcap comes and sings, He's alright.

00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.041
For Him it doesn't matter,

00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:21.041
He's not meticulous about how the music is and what the notes are,

00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.625
whether it is alright or not, no.

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.291
He is beyond all these things.

00:27:27.333 --> 00:27:31.875
He is beyond all these formalities that we have about everything,

00:27:32.291 --> 00:27:35.125
he is beyond.

00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:40.792
He is spirituality itself, he is beyond all these things.

00:27:41.166 --> 00:27:46.458
Whether you are a musician or you are an artist,

00:27:46.792 --> 00:27:51.792
whatever it is you are, He'll enjoy.

00:27:52.166 --> 00:27:56.208
He's the enjoyer, and He'll enjoy -

00:27:56.625 --> 00:28:02.625
whatever is simple, whatever is given with the heart, He'll enjoy.

00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:06.000
Whatever is expressed with the heart, He'll enjoy.

00:28:06.125 --> 00:28:10.333
He is not a conditioned person,

00:28:10.792 --> 00:28:15.208
that it should be modern, it should be such and such.

00:28:15.625 --> 00:28:17.166
He is not conditioned.

00:28:17.208 --> 00:28:22.166
He doesn't think that way like human beings who will sit down

00:28:22.208 --> 00:28:27.375
and make a meticulous everything, does it fit into it or not.

00:28:27.792 --> 00:28:31.291
Even, even for art,

00:28:31.375 --> 00:28:37.166
even for anything that is created out of somebody's heart,

00:28:37.208 --> 00:28:40.625
they will try to discourage that person.

00:28:42.041 --> 00:28:46.375
I have seen people, they have such conditioning.

00:28:46.792 --> 00:28:50.166
And one thing about Shiva, he has no

00:28:50.208 --> 00:28:53.792
conditioning of any kind, nothing.

00:28:54.375 --> 00:28:57.291
That's why they call him a mast-maulaa

00:28:57.375 --> 00:29:00.208
- He is not at all conditioned.

00:29:00.667 --> 00:29:03.208
If you have any conditioning in your mind,

00:29:03.417 --> 00:29:05.208
then you are not a Shiva bhakta.

00:29:05.667 --> 00:29:08.792
It's all right, you should dress up well, you should do this,

00:29:09.166 --> 00:29:12.792
but you should not have conditioning that 'If you don't do that

00:29:13.166 --> 00:29:21.208
you are being out of cast, out of fashion, out of this'.

00:29:22.667 --> 00:29:27.667
It is very difficult for people not to accept.

00:29:29.041 --> 00:29:32.375
All kinds of fashions are coming nowadays, all kinds.

00:29:32.792 --> 00:29:36.291
I tell them, "What is this?" "Oh this is the fashion. "

00:29:36.375 --> 00:29:39.500
Is it some God behind this fashion,

00:29:39.959 --> 00:29:43.125
or is there some deity who is telling you these fashions?

00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:45.959
Today it comes, tomorrow it will disappear.

00:29:47.125 --> 00:29:49.041
So, what I am saying,

00:29:49.125 --> 00:29:53.291
that if you have to worship Shiva,

00:29:53.375 --> 00:29:56.291
you should de-condition yourself.

00:29:57.041 --> 00:30:00.125
You are living in the world of Sahasrara.

00:30:00.959 --> 00:30:05.291
Now, somebody is not properly dressed - finished!

00:30:05.375 --> 00:30:08.959
Somebody is over-popularly dressed - finished!

00:30:09.125 --> 00:30:13.959
Human beings have a capacity to criticise everyone.

00:30:15.291 --> 00:30:19.542
And to criticise everyone, this is nothing fundamental

00:30:19.959 --> 00:30:23.375
because if you do it on vibrations, one can understand.

00:30:23.792 --> 00:30:25.959
But not on vibrations, just

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.375
because 'this is not the fashion, that is not the fashion'.

00:30:32.792 --> 00:30:36.291
What is the fashion of Shiva, tell me.

00:30:36.667 --> 00:30:38.792
Has He any fashions?

00:30:40.208 --> 00:30:42.542
Anything you give Him, He's happy.

00:30:42.959 --> 00:30:45.542
Whatever you give Him, He eats that.

00:30:45.959 --> 00:30:54.542
He is full of such appreciation because He is personified as Joy.

00:30:55.208 --> 00:30:58.000
He is peace and He is joy.

00:30:58.375 --> 00:31:02.041
If you are worshippers of Shiva,

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:08.542
then you should not have any conditioning of any kind.

00:31:11.375 --> 00:31:15.542
I mean, normally I also wear simple saris, very simple.

00:31:15.959 --> 00:31:20.667
And it happens that people think I am a very poor woman.

00:31:21.041 --> 00:31:22.667
I am poor

00:31:24.125 --> 00:31:29.166
because I don't care for money, I don't bother.

00:31:29.542 --> 00:31:39.166
So, we should know that Shiva is the poorest man, purest God.

00:31:39.542 --> 00:31:45.125
He doesn't wear any alankaras, he doesn't wear anything, just

00:31:46.166 --> 00:31:49.166
he lives with his own body.

00:31:49.542 --> 00:31:56.000
Because he is nothing but embodiment of enjoyment,

00:31:56.458 --> 00:32:04.834
nothing but complete form of enjoyment and joy.

00:32:06.208 --> 00:32:10.834
So another quality of Shiva bhakta* should be joy.

00:32:12.166 --> 00:32:15.834
You should be joyous about everything

00:32:16.208 --> 00:32:20.959
- whatever you see, whatever type of person you see.

00:32:21.166 --> 00:32:23.291
So the only way you can do, is

00:32:23.709 --> 00:32:27.542
give up human quality of criticism

00:32:30.458 --> 00:32:32.709
- to criticise others.

00:32:33.125 --> 00:32:36.291
Like if the English go into the Indian house,

00:32:36.709 --> 00:32:37.959
they say "We don't like it. "

00:32:38.041 --> 00:32:39.291
"Just, what, what you don't like?"

00:32:39.709 --> 00:32:42.291
"We didn't like the carpet. "

00:32:42.709 --> 00:32:48.542
'I don't like it' itself is against Shiva Shakti.

00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000
Then, if supposing an American goes to an English home,

00:32:53.041 --> 00:32:56.125
he'll say, "I don't like it. " It's very common.

00:32:56.166 --> 00:32:59.709
All the people say "I don't like it", "I didn't like that".

00:33:00.125 --> 00:33:01.834
Who are you

00:33:02.208 --> 00:33:05.458
to say 'I don't like it' or 'I like it'.

00:33:05.834 --> 00:33:10.208
People don't realise that by saying all these things,

00:33:10.333 --> 00:33:14.834
you are showing that there is no Shiva principle in you.

00:33:18.208 --> 00:33:22.041
I can understand somebody who cannot walk, alright,

00:33:22.458 --> 00:33:28.125
for such a person is allowed to use some sticks or something,

00:33:28.166 --> 00:33:30.166
allowed.

00:33:30.625 --> 00:33:32.125
But if he says "I don't like that person

00:33:32.333 --> 00:33:34.709
because he doesn't use the stick.",

00:33:35.125 --> 00:33:39.000
shows that he is such an egoistical fellow;

00:33:39.041 --> 00:33:43.041
himself he is using the stick and

00:33:43.375 --> 00:33:46.542
he wants to create what, votes or what,

00:33:46.750 --> 00:33:49.458
in a democratic country, that people should

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:54.458
walk with the sticks in their hands. It is very difficult.

00:33:54.834 --> 00:33:57.709
In the west it is very common, you see,

00:33:58.125 --> 00:34:00.041
to have this kind of a hat,

00:34:00.458 --> 00:34:03.291
to have this kind of a dress,

00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:05.208
to wear this kind of a cheroot.

00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:09.125
All kinds of things have a conditioning.

00:34:10.208 --> 00:34:15.625
Nowadays the hairstyle has become very funny with women.

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:19.291
Because they don't put oil in their hair.

00:34:20.333 --> 00:34:26.208
They will not have any grease in their head.

00:34:26.625 --> 00:34:30.000
If somebody's going to meet them they will wash their hair.

00:34:31.041 --> 00:34:33.291
I don't think it looks very nice.

00:34:33.333 --> 00:34:34.625
Of course I don't say that

00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:39.875
you need not have so much of oil on your face and ears.

00:34:40.291 --> 00:34:43.333
But, what is so important?

00:34:46.041 --> 00:34:55.208
In life, is also this is another thing that we are very self-centred.

00:34:56.709 --> 00:34:59.000
We want to impress people.

00:35:00.500 --> 00:35:07.291
If I wear a dress or anything, it should impress.

00:35:08.333 --> 00:35:12.000
I mean, even it impresses - what?

00:35:13.041 --> 00:35:17.041
If a snake comes along, he will bit you, whatever dress

00:35:17.875 --> 00:35:21.500
you might be wearing, whatever country you might be from.

00:35:21.875 --> 00:35:29.625
All this kind of identification, it doesn't behove a Shiva bhakta.

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.625
A Shiva bhakta has to be just

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:39.625
absolutely lost in the raptures of joy.

00:35:41.792 --> 00:35:47.208
Very particular about hairdress, very particular about dresses

00:35:47.417 --> 00:35:50.166
- I don't know what they are particular about.

00:35:50.208 --> 00:35:54.208
With all that, what do they gain? Nothing.

00:35:55.625 --> 00:35:57.667
Do they become popular?

00:35:58.458 --> 00:36:00.959
And this kind of popularity,

00:36:01.291 --> 00:36:04.792
which is so skin-deep, what's the use?

00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:10.792
You must have respect, respect of your being.

00:36:11.166 --> 00:36:17.041
As not only human beings, but as Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:18.125 --> 00:36:20.166
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:25.875
We are Shiva's bhaktas, we don't care.

00:36:27.291 --> 00:36:28.875
We are not bothered.

00:36:30.208 --> 00:36:35.125
Whatever it is, Shiva is there within us

00:36:35.375 --> 00:36:45.208
and we shine with that power within us that is of Kundalini.

00:36:47.375 --> 00:36:50.125
You may be very well dressed, you may be anything.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.792
If your vibrations are bad, what's the use?

00:36:54.166 --> 00:36:55.959
If you cannot judge people

00:36:56.291 --> 00:36:58.959
by their vibrations,by nonsensical things

00:36:59.291 --> 00:37:04.583
like their dress and moustaches, is it of any value?

00:37:04.875 --> 00:37:10.208
In Sahaja Yoga your value system has to be Sahaj.

00:37:12.667 --> 00:37:14.875
I have seen many people,

00:37:15.291 --> 00:37:18.166
"I don't like their house, I didn't like this …"

00:37:18.208 --> 00:37:23.875
'I don't like' is the sentence, is nishiddha,

00:37:24.291 --> 00:37:27.667
is to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

00:37:31.041 --> 00:37:33.375
If you don't like anything, you are not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:37:37.291 --> 00:37:43.500
Now, of course, I mean, if there is somebody who is anti-Sahaj and all that,

00:37:43.959 --> 00:37:48.375
but still by saying 'I don't like', what are you going to gain?

00:37:50.291 --> 00:37:52.166
It's a waste of energy.

00:37:56.291 --> 00:38:01.291
Because of this, in Sahaja Yoga I have seen,

00:38:01.375 --> 00:38:05.500
people have created problems for Me, so many problems.

00:38:05.959 --> 00:38:10.375
Only because they are so much 'self' oriented.

00:38:12.792 --> 00:38:16.792
"This man is bad, that woman is bad, he is this, that …"

00:38:17.166 --> 00:38:18.500
Sometimes I am surprised.

00:38:18.792 --> 00:38:21.792
Because when those people come to me,

00:38:22.125 --> 00:38:25.375
I am amazed that they are very nice people.

00:38:26.792 --> 00:38:30.291
But people are very self-centred, also.

00:38:30.583 --> 00:38:35.375
Like I have seen people who are not bothered

00:38:35.792 --> 00:38:42.667
to come to meetings, to pujas.

00:38:44.041 --> 00:38:46.208
Because they have got work.

00:38:48.291 --> 00:38:54.291
Altogether there are eleven pujas, but they don't come.

00:38:56.667 --> 00:38:59.291
Because they are very busy.

00:39:00.667 --> 00:39:02.959
At least to one puja you should come.

00:39:04.041 --> 00:39:12.667
But those who are Shiva bhaktas only enjoy nothing but pujas.

00:39:13.208 --> 00:39:15.208
Nothing else

00:39:16.291 --> 00:39:22.542
Their whole being is absolutely vibrated with Shiva puja.

00:39:22.959 --> 00:39:25.667
To them, that's the most important thing to do.

00:39:27.041 --> 00:39:29.959
Also there are people in Sahaja Yoga

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.291
who are trying to make money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:33.667 --> 00:39:37.166
Very wrong, very wrong, very wrong.

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:42.959
Sahaja Yoga is to give you punyas,

00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.375
to give you blessings,

00:39:45.834 --> 00:39:49.000
and if that is not in your mind,

00:39:49.458 --> 00:39:50.375
better give up Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:50.625 --> 00:39:53.959
You can join some business or something

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:56.834
of malpractices very easily, very easily.

00:39:57.208 --> 00:39:59.458
Till you end up in the jail you are there.

00:40:02.834 --> 00:40:08.291
But to enjoy your spiritual powers

00:40:08.667 --> 00:40:11.291
you must learn certain things.

00:40:11.667 --> 00:40:15.166
And one of them is de-condition yourself

00:40:15.542 --> 00:40:19.166
- 'I don't like it' or 'I like it' -

00:40:19.458 --> 00:40:23.709
this sentence must go away from your tongue!

00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.125
Likes and dislikes

00:40:30.166 --> 00:40:33.125
are only for people who have limited vision.

00:40:36.166 --> 00:40:39.458
You should learn to appreciate.

00:40:39.834 --> 00:40:42.166
Your power of appreciation will show

00:40:42.542 --> 00:40:45.583
how spiritually you are endowed.

00:40:48.959 --> 00:40:54.458
And your power of observation

00:40:54.750 --> 00:40:56.959
will show what do you observe.

00:40:58.041 --> 00:41:00.834
For example, some people will come and tell me,

00:41:01.041 --> 00:41:05.458
"I didn't like that lady, she was wearing a funny sari. "

00:41:06.834 --> 00:41:08.458
I mean, what is this?

00:41:10.834 --> 00:41:16.041
"I didn't like her, because she was putting her hand on her head".

00:41:16.458 --> 00:41:18.333
So what?

00:41:19.709 --> 00:41:22.542
Because you make your own images of people, and you want

00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000
everybody to be like that, otherwise you don't like it.

00:41:27.458 --> 00:41:31.125
Whether you like it or don't like it, nobody's going to change.

00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:34.458
Why waste your energy?

00:41:36.208 --> 00:41:39.542
Sometimes there are musicians who are not so good.

00:41:46.458 --> 00:41:54.625
I remember, once I went home and I asked my father,

00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.041
"How does this musician sing?"

00:41:57.458 --> 00:42:01.291
He says, "He's very courageous, very courageous. "

00:42:01.333 --> 00:42:03.291
I said, "Why, what happened?"

00:42:03.542 --> 00:42:08.125
He said (?), "He sings without bothering about it

00:42:08.166 --> 00:42:10.583
and he goes out of tune sometimes,

00:42:10.792 --> 00:42:13.000
he goes out of taala, doesn't matter,

00:42:13.041 --> 00:42:14.333
but he sings.

00:42:14.709 --> 00:42:16.458
He's very courageous, himmatwala"

00:42:16.834 --> 00:42:21.000
So, that's how he used to appreciate, I have seen.

00:42:21.041 --> 00:42:26.333
When this fellow started singing, I saw he was like that,

00:42:26.709 --> 00:42:31.709
but my father was saying "Wa-wa, wa-wa" to him and encouraging him.

00:42:32.125 --> 00:42:36.041
You see, I have seen in my father these divine qualities,

00:42:36.458 --> 00:42:39.333
how he used to tolerate,

00:42:39.709 --> 00:42:43.875
how he used to - I mean not tolerance also, just appreciation.

00:42:44.291 --> 00:42:47.709
Of any kind of thing he used to appreciate.

00:42:47.875 --> 00:42:50.917
That's what, if the Sahaja Yogis have that

00:42:51.208 --> 00:42:56.208
condition of appreciation they will enjoy everything.

00:42:56.417 --> 00:42:59.625
Because you kill your enjoyment, do you know that?

00:43:02.041 --> 00:43:05.625
You are all variety of people here, all variety of dresses,

00:43:05.792 --> 00:43:10.500
all variety of families and so many countries you are here -

00:43:10.875 --> 00:43:14.291
to Me you are nothing but Sahaja Yogis, my children, that's all.

00:43:16.333 --> 00:43:19.792
Now I don't go on judging you on your dress, or

00:43:19.959 --> 00:43:22.875
on what your hairstyle is, no.

00:43:24.333 --> 00:43:27.500
All modern things are extremely conditioning.

00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:35.500
And they condition you so much that you get irresponsible.

00:43:36.500 --> 00:43:39.041
As Sahaja Yogis you get irresponsible.

00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:44.291
Your first and foremost responsibility is Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:44.333 --> 00:43:47.208
Because you should know what a work it is.

00:43:48.625 --> 00:43:55.125
It is such a great work, to transform the whole world - that is My vision.

00:43:55.500 --> 00:43:58.792
At this old age also I think the same way.

00:43:59.166 --> 00:44:03.500
Now, if that is My vision, what should be your attitude?

00:44:03.875 --> 00:44:08.125
That we should go all out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:08.500 --> 00:44:10.208
That's the main thing.

00:44:10.625 --> 00:44:17.792
I call you for these pujas just to renovate, I should say, or

00:44:18.166 --> 00:44:21.500
to give you more of energy and all that.

00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:24.709
But if you are just taking it as a great

00:44:24.959 --> 00:44:27.959
blessings and sitting at home it's of no use.

00:44:29.125 --> 00:44:31.041
You must spread Sahaja Yoga!

00:44:31.125 --> 00:44:34.291
I was surprised that they said

00:44:34.583 --> 00:44:40.792
in Lucknow there are only 200 Sahaja Yogis. How can that be?

00:44:41.291 --> 00:44:43.291
First time I went to Lucknow,

00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.875
there were at least three thousand Sahaja Yogis

00:44:46.291 --> 00:44:49.375
and we had not fixed any hall or anything.

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:53.875
And can you imagine, suddenly I find so many people.

00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:58.166
How is it there can be two hundred Sahaja Yogis?

00:44:58.208 --> 00:45:03.375
Either you are telling lies, or you are good for nothing.

00:45:04.792 --> 00:45:07.792
So the responsibility of all the Sahaja Yogis,

00:45:08.041 --> 00:45:13.125
of all the Sahaja Yogis, first and foremost,

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.291
is to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:16.375 --> 00:45:18.500
How many people have you given realisation?

00:45:19.875 --> 00:45:22.125
Where have you talked about Sahaja Yoga?

00:45:22.500 --> 00:45:25.875
I have seen even in the plane, if you are travelling,

00:45:26.166 --> 00:45:30.917
anyone who is there will tell Me "My guru is this,

00:45:31.208 --> 00:45:33.875
you know, such a great guru, this that. "

00:45:34.291 --> 00:45:37.667
Openly, shamelessly, about horrible gurus!

00:45:38.250 --> 00:45:45.166
While you people are very shy to talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:46.291 --> 00:45:49.375
Never publicly unless and until

00:45:49.792 --> 00:45:54.166
you have a programme, and public programme and all that.

00:45:56.291 --> 00:46:01.166
You have no time, also, for Sahaja Yoga, very busy people.

00:46:05.667 --> 00:46:12.917
So, if you have to follow Shiva and His blessings all the time,

00:46:13.125 --> 00:46:14.667
His protection to you...

00:46:14.959 --> 00:46:22.375
then you have to be Sahaja Yogis of very high quality.

00:46:24.792 --> 00:46:27.792
It shows when you go all out

00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:30.125
to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:46:33.041 --> 00:46:35.375
That is the thing missing.

00:46:35.792 --> 00:46:38.667
I am so very happy that in Australia

00:46:39.041 --> 00:46:41.375
Sahaja Yoga has spread so much.

00:46:41.792 --> 00:46:45.125
I don't know what has happened.

00:46:45.542 --> 00:46:49.041
In a far-fetched place like Australia.

00:46:49.959 --> 00:46:53.208
In the beginning I had some set-backs

00:46:53.291 --> 00:46:58.083
but now it has spread. Also in Austria it has spread.

00:46:58.250 --> 00:47:00.959
And also in Italy.

00:47:03.041 --> 00:47:08.041
But otherwise, just doesn't spread. What's the matter?

00:47:08.166 --> 00:47:12.000
The matter is the leaders are not going all-out.

00:47:12.375 --> 00:47:16.291
Say, for in England I travelled from north to south,

00:47:16.667 --> 00:47:19.208
east to west in all the directions.

00:47:21.959 --> 00:47:27.375
We have very poor, very poor Sahaja Yogis there.

00:47:27.834 --> 00:47:32.959
You have to go to universities, to younger people.

00:47:34.041 --> 00:47:40.000
If hippy-ism can spread, why not Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.542
It spread like wild-fire, why not Sahaja Yoga?

00:47:47.959 --> 00:47:54.542
All these things are there, which I have to warn you - be careful!

00:47:55.959 --> 00:47:59.667
If you have got Realisation, you have a responsibility

00:48:00.125 --> 00:48:05.208
- to give realisation to others, and to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:08.291 --> 00:48:12.166
If you can't do it, then God save you.

00:48:12.542 --> 00:48:13.959
I have nothing to say.

00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:18.000
You have to introspect,

00:48:18.458 --> 00:48:20.458
'What have I done for Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:21.834 --> 00:48:23.458
What have I got from Sahaja Yoga?'

00:48:25.834 --> 00:48:29.667
And I am sure after this Shiva puja,

00:48:29.917 --> 00:48:34.542
you will dedicate yourself to Shiva principle within you.

00:48:34.834 --> 00:48:38.834
Shiva principle doesn't 'stir out',

00:48:39.208 --> 00:48:47.959
it's very, very stern, it's very powerful.

00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:56.458
You have to dedicate, and you have to surrender.

00:48:56.834 --> 00:49:03.166
Above every other job, above every other performance,

00:49:03.542 --> 00:49:05.458
the highest is this.

00:49:05.834 --> 00:49:13.709
So, with this, I ask Shiva to give you blessings,

00:49:14.125 --> 00:49:16.041
complete blessings,

00:49:16.458 --> 00:49:22.333
so that you get transformed into the personality of Shiva.

00:49:22.709 --> 00:49:23.333
May God bless you all.
