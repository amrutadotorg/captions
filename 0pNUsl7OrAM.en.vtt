00:02:05.512 --> 00:02:09.402
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:18.372
as a very great personality.

00:02:19.522 --> 00:02:24.582
And you know why He came on this earth –

00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:34.462
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:46.352
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

00:02:51.562 --> 00:02:59.372
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

00:02:59.502 --> 00:03:08.542
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

00:03:11.392 --> 00:03:13.482
And you had very great leaders

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:18.432
who followed Him

00:03:21.392 --> 00:03:26.352
and who worshipped Him in a way,

00:03:27.462 --> 00:03:33.382
and created a new world of this America.

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:38.512
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

00:03:39.552 --> 00:03:46.562
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

00:03:48.432 --> 00:03:52.472
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

00:03:53.362 --> 00:03:58.352
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

00:03:58.512 --> 00:04:01.442
about Shri Krishna:

00:04:04.582 --> 00:04:12.482
that He was a great master of wealth,

00:04:14.372 --> 00:04:20.382
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

00:04:20.512 --> 00:04:24.512
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

00:04:26.512 --> 00:04:30.522
They all forgot about it completely

00:04:31.432 --> 00:04:35.412
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

00:04:35.582 --> 00:04:45.442
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

00:04:45.582 --> 00:04:54.342
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

00:04:56.582 --> 00:05:01.462
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

00:05:02.512 --> 00:05:05.552
He achieves money;

00:05:07.582 --> 00:05:10.352
and not only that,

00:05:10.542 --> 00:05:14.362
He is living, He lived in money.

00:05:15.382 --> 00:05:21.502
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:27.422
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

00:05:27.582 --> 00:05:30.462
but it submerged in the water,

00:05:30.552 --> 00:05:37.442
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

00:05:37.562 --> 00:05:42.442
But now they have found out His house under the water,

00:05:42.542 --> 00:05:44.372
very deep waters,

00:05:45.342 --> 00:05:52.372
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

00:05:52.512 --> 00:05:56.542
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

00:05:57.412 --> 00:05:58.542
by dharma.

00:05:59.452 --> 00:06:04.392
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

00:06:04.552 --> 00:06:07.382
out of gold.

00:06:07.502 --> 00:06:11.472
It is still there and people have found it,

00:06:12.462 --> 00:06:15.502
but under the sea.

00:06:16.572 --> 00:06:21.342
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

00:06:22.362 --> 00:06:25.542
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

00:06:26.412 --> 00:06:28.412
it is still existing.

00:06:28.552 --> 00:06:33.432
That’s what it is, because He was the one

00:06:33.562 --> 00:06:37.442
who was for satya first – truth.

00:06:38.372 --> 00:06:44.492
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

00:06:45.382 --> 00:06:48.552
on the principle of truth.

00:06:49.472 --> 00:06:53.382
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

00:06:53.522 --> 00:07:00.422
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

00:07:00.582 --> 00:07:07.542
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

00:07:08.462 --> 00:07:12.532
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

00:07:13.502 --> 00:07:18.372
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

00:07:22.452 --> 00:07:25.342
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

00:07:25.472 --> 00:07:27.412
money at all,

00:07:27.562 --> 00:07:32.342
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

00:07:32.542 --> 00:07:35.502
I’m so hopelessly bad –

00:07:36.412 --> 00:07:40.582
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

00:07:41.492 --> 00:07:46.412
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

00:07:47.412 --> 00:07:49.582
But He’s there to look after,

00:07:50.482 --> 00:07:54.572
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

00:07:55.582 --> 00:08:00.362
wealth, it’s all full of it.

00:08:01.362 --> 00:08:06.432
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

00:08:07.472 --> 00:08:10.522
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

00:08:11.392 --> 00:08:15.572
you don’t look for money.

00:08:16.462 --> 00:08:20.502
What happened in your country that some people got money.

00:08:21.372 --> 00:08:25.372
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

00:08:25.542 --> 00:08:28.382
They’re not satisfied people.

00:08:28.512 --> 00:08:33.542
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

00:08:35.482 --> 00:08:38.522
It is something very much human.

00:08:39.432 --> 00:08:42.572
After your human evolution,

00:08:43.442 --> 00:08:47.402
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

00:08:47.582 --> 00:08:54.582
then all these demeaning things like greed

00:08:56.422 --> 00:08:59.432
all disappear from your character.

00:08:59.432 --> 00:09:03.522
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

00:09:04.422 --> 00:09:09.352
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

00:09:09.482 --> 00:09:13.572
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

00:09:15.352 --> 00:09:23.472
It is just that you think don’t need it, and you’ll get it –

00:09:24.392 --> 00:09:27.582
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

00:09:28.452 --> 00:09:31.462
He’s doing all this, looking after you

00:09:32.342 --> 00:09:35.582
and helping you with money.

00:09:36.462 --> 00:09:39.552
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

00:09:40.442 --> 00:09:43.442
I don’t, never had any problem.

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:51.432
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

00:09:51.572 --> 00:09:55.362
He looks after people who don’t have money.

00:09:55.502 --> 00:09:59.402
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

00:09:59.562 --> 00:10:04.492
who enjoy the life of truth.

00:10:07.452 --> 00:10:19.522
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

00:10:20.562 --> 00:10:22.482
They have this much, they want to have more;

00:10:23.402 --> 00:10:25.492
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

00:10:26.362 --> 00:10:29.382
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

00:10:29.522 --> 00:10:34.432
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

00:10:34.552 --> 00:10:38.492
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

00:10:39.392 --> 00:10:41.492
whatever you have.

00:10:42.362 --> 00:10:45.442
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

00:10:45.552 --> 00:10:49.452
and you don’t hanker after something that is not there.

00:10:49.552 --> 00:10:52.362
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

00:10:53.382 --> 00:10:55.352
Many a times people have asked Me,

00:10:55.482 --> 00:11:00.492
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

00:11:00.572 --> 00:11:02.462
I said, “All right.

00:11:02.572 --> 00:11:05.412
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

00:11:05.542 --> 00:11:07.502
Let them learn a lesson,

00:11:08.352 --> 00:11:11.512
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

00:11:12.362 --> 00:11:17.402
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

00:11:18.582 --> 00:11:23.462
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

00:11:24.512 --> 00:11:28.492
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

00:11:28.582 --> 00:11:34.352
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

00:11:34.452 --> 00:11:37.582
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

00:11:38.412 --> 00:11:40.502
Where is that money gone?

00:11:41.342 --> 00:11:42.392
They’re very clever.

00:11:42.482 --> 00:11:45.582
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

00:11:45.582 --> 00:11:48.462
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

00:11:48.542 --> 00:11:50.572
you can’t get out that money.”

00:11:51.432 --> 00:11:55.422
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

00:11:55.572 --> 00:12:01.402
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

00:12:02.532 --> 00:12:05.572
that they'll be caught up,

00:12:06.502 --> 00:12:10.382
and they continued for so many years.

00:12:11.482 --> 00:12:14.422
But I’m sure one day

00:12:14.492 --> 00:12:18.512
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

00:12:19.442 --> 00:12:24.432
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

00:12:24.532 --> 00:12:30.422
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

00:12:31.342 --> 00:12:35.352
what lies behind the money,

00:12:39.502 --> 00:12:45.342
what is the point of having money.

00:12:45.402 --> 00:12:47.382
This country had money.

00:12:47.502 --> 00:12:52.502
As a result so many good people came here to work,

00:12:53.352 --> 00:12:56.412
and you had so many complementary things.

00:12:57.342 --> 00:13:00.522
You had lots of people who have complemented,

00:13:01.362 --> 00:13:05.342
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

00:13:05.442 --> 00:13:09.422
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

00:13:09.492 --> 00:13:11.562
they were little bit lacking.

00:13:12.412 --> 00:13:15.392
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

00:13:15.482 --> 00:13:20.522
and also they were very focused people,

00:13:21.352 --> 00:13:23.452
so they worked it out very well.

00:13:23.562 --> 00:13:28.382
Also they respected people who came with brains.

00:13:28.502 --> 00:13:31.562
So this is what happens when you forget

00:13:32.452 --> 00:13:36.352
that truth is the main point.

00:13:36.432 --> 00:13:41.362
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

00:13:41.462 --> 00:13:46.342
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

00:13:46.422 --> 00:13:52.492
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

00:13:54.342 --> 00:13:57.512
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas – last year.

00:13:59.362 --> 00:14:01.462
And when we stopped at that airport

00:14:02.372 --> 00:14:05.382
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

00:14:05.542 --> 00:14:07.532
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

00:14:08.412 --> 00:14:09.522
in their family or what has happened.

00:14:10.442 --> 00:14:12.402
First I couldn’t understand.

00:14:12.522 --> 00:14:16.462
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

00:14:20.552 --> 00:14:24.452
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

00:14:24.562 --> 00:14:26.582
they are crying because they have lost the money.

00:14:27.432 --> 00:14:29.462
What’s the use of such a money

00:14:29.572 --> 00:14:34.352
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

00:14:34.472 --> 00:14:39.582
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

00:14:40.492 --> 00:14:47.352
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

00:14:47.542 --> 00:14:52.432
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

00:14:52.572 --> 00:14:56.552
with that little money, they buy something.

00:14:57.422 --> 00:15:00.402
Then they think money is very important.

00:15:00.532 --> 00:15:03.442
You see, you can buy lots of things,

00:15:03.542 --> 00:15:06.452
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

00:15:07.432 --> 00:15:12.462
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

00:15:12.582 --> 00:15:17.352
after that mad money which makes you mad.

00:15:17.462 --> 00:15:21.562
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

00:15:22.472 --> 00:15:25.542
the falsehood of this maya money.

00:15:26.432 --> 00:15:30.362
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

00:15:30.492 --> 00:15:36.352
and all their power of money was finished.

00:15:36.512 --> 00:15:41.462
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

00:15:42.502 --> 00:15:48.422
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

00:15:48.562 --> 00:15:54.582
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

00:15:56.362 --> 00:15:58.422
Now money matters:

00:15:58.562 --> 00:16:04.352
He first befools you that you run after it,

00:16:05.382 --> 00:16:09.522
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

00:16:10.382 --> 00:16:15.342
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

00:16:15.452 --> 00:16:17.422
He got little money,

00:16:17.562 --> 00:16:23.402
and he got into the grab of this maya.

00:16:23.522 --> 00:16:26.562
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

00:16:27.412 --> 00:16:30.362
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

00:16:30.512 --> 00:16:34.382
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

00:16:34.472 --> 00:16:39.382
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

00:16:39.472 --> 00:16:42.432
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

00:16:42.512 --> 00:16:44.442
and it was like that he was talking.

00:16:45.392 --> 00:16:50.572
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

00:16:51.432 --> 00:16:54.532
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

00:16:55.372 --> 00:16:58.422
and all the eggs broke.

00:16:58.532 --> 00:17:01.472
So the maya was over.

00:17:02.382 --> 00:17:05.442
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

00:17:05.572 --> 00:17:10.442
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

00:17:10.582 --> 00:17:17.362
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

00:17:17.442 --> 00:17:20.412
complete vision of the destruction

00:17:20.532 --> 00:17:25.352
that can follow this maya business.

00:17:25.572 --> 00:17:30.412
It is something, such a insight

00:17:30.542 --> 00:17:33.442
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

00:17:34.382 --> 00:17:38.352
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

00:17:38.462 --> 00:17:42.352
But even if you understand the value of money,

00:17:42.452 --> 00:17:46.362
even if you understand that money can bring

00:17:46.472 --> 00:17:51.432
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

00:17:51.512 --> 00:17:57.502
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

00:17:57.572 --> 00:18:01.422
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

00:18:01.502 --> 00:18:06.362
It’s not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

00:18:06.472 --> 00:18:11.402
temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

00:18:11.492 --> 00:18:15.482
just because he’s above it.

00:18:15.582 --> 00:18:19.512
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

00:18:20.352 --> 00:18:23.542
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

00:18:24.372 --> 00:18:28.362
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:18:28.472 --> 00:18:30.472
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

00:18:30.552 --> 00:18:33.342
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

00:18:33.482 --> 00:18:37.462
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

00:18:38.342 --> 00:18:41.442
we have certain viruses in India also.

00:18:41.582 --> 00:18:44.352
So they still go on running after money,

00:18:44.472 --> 00:18:46.472
to them money is important.

00:18:47.382 --> 00:18:50.562
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

00:18:51.432 --> 00:18:54.482
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

00:18:55.362 --> 00:19:00.342
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money’s not so important.

00:19:00.452 --> 00:19:02.512
It’s not so important.

00:19:07.382 --> 00:19:16.372
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

00:19:17.532 --> 00:19:19.572
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

00:19:20.472 --> 00:19:24.482
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

00:19:25.352 --> 00:19:30.342
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

00:19:30.422 --> 00:19:36.462
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

00:19:36.572 --> 00:19:41.442
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

00:19:43.372 --> 00:19:45.582
Come here and fix it please.

00:19:51.372 --> 00:19:54.512
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

00:19:59.442 --> 00:20:03.432
Correct, now all right.

00:20:05.532 --> 00:20:13.532
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

00:20:21.432 --> 00:20:23.552
to their spirit,

00:20:24.452 --> 00:20:30.432
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

00:20:30.572 --> 00:20:37.402
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

00:20:38.442 --> 00:20:40.372
This is something

00:20:40.542 --> 00:20:45.342
very, very simple,

00:20:45.522 --> 00:20:48.422
but sometimes you don’t do it.

00:20:48.562 --> 00:20:54.352
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

00:20:54.472 --> 00:20:57.462
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

00:20:58.352 --> 00:21:02.362
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

00:21:03.522 --> 00:21:05.482
But people have;

00:21:06.372 --> 00:21:08.402
they think by that people are impressed,

00:21:08.522 --> 00:21:11.492
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

00:21:12.412 --> 00:21:15.562
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

00:21:16.422 --> 00:21:18.542
What do you get out of it?

00:21:19.402 --> 00:21:24.462
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

00:21:24.572 --> 00:21:26.442
more than anything else.

00:21:27.352 --> 00:21:28.562
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

00:21:29.432 --> 00:21:32.362
It’s a headache to possess things also.

00:21:32.502 --> 00:21:36.452
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

00:21:37.442 --> 00:21:40.522
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:21:41.412 --> 00:21:43.542
you’ll have never a problem of money.

00:21:44.412 --> 00:21:47.422
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

00:21:47.552 --> 00:21:51.562
So far as I am concerned,

00:21:52.422 --> 00:21:56.482
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

00:21:57.362 --> 00:21:59.452
because I don’t know from where it works out,

00:21:59.572 --> 00:22:05.482
how it works out, without any effort.

00:22:07.482 --> 00:22:12.582
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

00:22:13.462 --> 00:22:15.542
temperamentally.

00:22:16.462 --> 00:22:23.462
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

00:22:25.392 --> 00:22:29.352
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

00:22:29.502 --> 00:22:33.562
it will sell at least ten times more.

00:22:34.452 --> 00:22:38.502
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

00:22:39.562 --> 00:22:45.472
It’s very surprising – automatically.

00:22:46.472 --> 00:22:53.342
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

00:22:53.532 --> 00:22:58.562
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

00:22:59.482 --> 00:23:03.502
So what I have to tell you is this,

00:23:04.412 --> 00:23:09.532
that you should not worry about your financial situations

00:23:10.382 --> 00:23:12.372
at all.

00:23:12.492 --> 00:23:14.432
Do not go on calculating,

00:23:14.552 --> 00:23:19.342
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

00:23:19.462 --> 00:23:21.342
what you have to do with your money,

00:23:21.452 --> 00:23:22.482
where you should invest.

00:23:23.382 --> 00:23:27.342
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

00:23:27.512 --> 00:23:31.432
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:23:31.562 --> 00:23:35.342
It all works automatically.

00:23:35.452 --> 00:23:39.432
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

00:23:39.572 --> 00:23:43.392
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

00:23:43.552 --> 00:23:47.482
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:48.392 --> 00:23:56.572
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

00:23:58.402 --> 00:24:01.492
You don’t know what is greed is.

00:24:02.582 --> 00:24:07.462
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

00:24:07.572 --> 00:24:10.432
generous.

00:24:10.572 --> 00:24:15.362
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

00:24:15.492 --> 00:24:18.462
That may be another way of doing it.

00:24:19.452 --> 00:24:25.392
Supposing you get something in your house

00:24:27.382 --> 00:24:29.412
and you think it is too much.

00:24:30.342 --> 00:24:33.372
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

00:24:33.372 --> 00:24:35.392
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

00:24:35.492 --> 00:24:37.392
whom can you give?

00:24:37.572 --> 00:24:39.582
And immediately you’ll remember,

00:24:40.442 --> 00:24:44.442
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

00:24:45.342 --> 00:24:48.502
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

00:24:49.382 --> 00:24:52.452
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

00:24:53.342 --> 00:24:57.342
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

00:25:00.572 --> 00:25:06.432
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

00:25:06.552 --> 00:25:11.382
how people like your generosity.

00:25:11.502 --> 00:25:14.502
So you have to be generous, just generous;

00:25:15.372 --> 00:25:17.472
not with yourself, but with others.

00:25:18.362 --> 00:25:23.392
As much as possible, be generous.

00:25:24.452 --> 00:25:32.432
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

00:25:32.552 --> 00:25:35.432
of your love.

00:25:35.552 --> 00:25:39.532
Many a times it has happened with Me

00:25:40.412 --> 00:25:44.532
that I saw somebody needed something,

00:25:46.362 --> 00:25:48.422
and kept it in My mind.

00:25:48.582 --> 00:25:52.432
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

00:25:53.352 --> 00:25:58.482
And the amount of love that person gave Me

00:25:59.362 --> 00:26:01.382
was thousand time more

00:26:01.522 --> 00:26:09.342
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

00:26:09.472 --> 00:26:13.442
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

00:26:13.542 --> 00:26:18.382
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

00:26:18.492 --> 00:26:20.562
I mean, I was surprised.

00:26:21.422 --> 00:26:23.522
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

00:26:24.392 --> 00:26:26.512
I said, “Just out of love.”

00:26:27.392 --> 00:26:30.422
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

00:26:30.512 --> 00:26:33.372
“What a generosity is!”

00:26:33.492 --> 00:26:37.562
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

00:26:39.442 --> 00:26:43.342
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

00:26:43.452 --> 00:26:47.552
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

00:26:48.402 --> 00:26:50.522
If you do that,

00:26:51.412 --> 00:26:56.422
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

00:26:57.432 --> 00:27:04.542
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

00:27:06.342 --> 00:27:11.462
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

00:27:12.482 --> 00:27:17.492
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

00:27:18.352 --> 00:27:22.452
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

00:27:23.572 --> 00:27:25.582
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

00:27:26.452 --> 00:27:28.372
in what conditions.

00:27:28.482 --> 00:27:32.452
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

00:27:33.432 --> 00:27:36.402
That will be just shocking.

00:27:36.512 --> 00:27:39.462
Sometimes, you see, you see people

00:27:40.572 --> 00:27:44.492
in India also in a very bad condition.

00:27:45.352 --> 00:27:47.512
Once I went to Calcutta

00:27:49.432 --> 00:27:54.542
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

00:27:55.402 --> 00:28:00.382
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

00:28:00.562 --> 00:28:05.492
very great poverty, even the children.

00:28:06.362 --> 00:28:09.552
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

00:28:10.442 --> 00:28:14.382
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

00:28:14.482 --> 00:28:16.442
what to do.

00:28:16.552 --> 00:28:19.562
Because I felt, “What is this?

00:28:20.462 --> 00:28:23.462
Why these people are so poor?”

00:28:23.562 --> 00:28:27.462
And I was helpless so I was crying,

00:28:27.552 --> 00:28:33.442
that one day I should try to do something for them.

00:28:33.562 --> 00:28:38.352
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

00:28:38.572 --> 00:28:47.402
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

00:28:48.432 --> 00:28:50.462
all kinds of things.

00:28:52.422 --> 00:28:57.552
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

00:28:59.412 --> 00:29:06.412
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

00:29:07.422 --> 00:29:09.482
I also sold some of My things,

00:29:10.352 --> 00:29:14.472
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

00:29:15.352 --> 00:29:18.502
so joy-giving to be generous.

00:29:19.482 --> 00:29:26.402
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

00:29:26.572 --> 00:29:29.512
That is the quality of Kubera.

00:29:30.422 --> 00:29:34.412
He’s an extremely generous personality,

00:29:35.422 --> 00:29:39.482
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

00:29:40.362 --> 00:29:43.492
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

00:29:44.492 --> 00:29:50.352
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

00:29:50.482 --> 00:29:53.442
so far, so far.

00:29:54.402 --> 00:29:59.582
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

00:30:00.442 --> 00:30:04.352
of very high quality.

00:30:04.462 --> 00:30:08.422
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

00:30:08.532 --> 00:30:14.472
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

00:30:15.352 --> 00:30:20.582
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

00:30:21.442 --> 00:30:24.462
Don’t give up anything.

00:30:24.562 --> 00:30:28.562
You have to give up from your heart.

00:30:29.442 --> 00:30:31.562
Just it should happen in your personality;

00:30:32.412 --> 00:30:34.552
don’t have to give up.

00:30:35.432 --> 00:30:44.352
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

00:30:45.362 --> 00:30:52.402
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

00:30:53.492 --> 00:30:56.442
On the contrary,

00:30:56.582 --> 00:30:59.532
you would like to give up everything.

00:31:00.402 --> 00:31:03.402
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

00:31:04.452 --> 00:31:07.472
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

00:31:08.342 --> 00:31:12.482
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

00:31:13.342 --> 00:31:15.452
So one day a thief came

00:31:16.342 --> 00:31:19.502
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

00:31:20.352 --> 00:31:23.532
these big horn ones – he took away.

00:31:24.442 --> 00:31:27.502
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

00:31:28.382 --> 00:31:29.442
So My mother asked him,

00:31:29.542 --> 00:31:31.472
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

00:31:32.352 --> 00:31:35.462
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

00:31:35.582 --> 00:31:42.452
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

00:31:43.452 --> 00:31:46.582
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

00:31:47.452 --> 00:31:50.402
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

00:31:50.522 --> 00:31:53.552
your records?”

00:31:55.492 --> 00:32:01.412
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

00:32:01.522 --> 00:32:04.562
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

00:32:05.422 --> 00:32:09.562
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

00:32:10.442 --> 00:32:15.372
But if you force it through religion,

00:32:15.512 --> 00:32:20.342
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

00:32:20.472 --> 00:32:23.352
don’t have to give up.

00:32:23.482 --> 00:32:27.482
You give up from within.

00:32:28.432 --> 00:32:32.462
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

00:32:32.582 --> 00:32:36.402
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

00:32:36.542 --> 00:32:41.542
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

00:32:42.442 --> 00:32:46.542
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

00:32:47.432 --> 00:32:51.382
but they lack generosity.

00:32:51.502 --> 00:32:54.502
That is another quality of Kubera.

00:32:55.372 --> 00:32:58.532
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

00:32:59.402 --> 00:33:03.392
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

00:33:03.492 --> 00:33:06.372
because the way He manages banks, you know,

00:33:06.472 --> 00:33:10.422
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

00:33:10.542 --> 00:33:15.352
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

00:33:15.502 --> 00:33:16.552
I don’t know.

00:33:17.422 --> 00:33:23.432
But He’s a very clever person,

00:33:25.582 --> 00:33:27.562
very intelligent,

00:33:28.432 --> 00:33:30.452
very alert,

00:33:31.492 --> 00:33:36.492
which is important if you have to deal with money –

00:33:37.542 --> 00:33:42.392
though He was absolutely detached from money.

00:33:43.352 --> 00:33:46.362
And just see His life, what He did.

00:33:46.472 --> 00:33:51.382
He lived in childhood with His guru,

00:33:51.542 --> 00:33:53.502
and He used to take

00:33:54.382 --> 00:34:03.462
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

00:34:05.472 --> 00:34:11.472
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

00:34:14.362 --> 00:34:18.572
He was playing with the boys

00:34:19.422 --> 00:34:23.572
who were looking after the cows in a very,

00:34:24.472 --> 00:34:27.412
I mean, ordinary family.

00:34:31.392 --> 00:34:34.462
He never hankered after money.

00:34:35.432 --> 00:34:36.572
He used to steal,

00:34:38.562 --> 00:34:44.362
used to steal the butter,

00:34:44.552 --> 00:34:50.462
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

00:34:54.462 --> 00:34:57.392
military people.

00:34:58.342 --> 00:35:00.442
So He used to eat that,

00:35:00.542 --> 00:35:04.372
so that this lady should not give it to them.

00:35:04.512 --> 00:35:08.432
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

00:35:08.552 --> 00:35:15.452
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

00:35:16.342 --> 00:35:19.552
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

00:35:20.432 --> 00:35:22.562
to these horrible soldiers,

00:35:23.422 --> 00:35:28.412
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

00:35:28.522 --> 00:35:31.462
In everything that He did,

00:35:32.342 --> 00:35:37.492
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

00:35:39.342 --> 00:35:44.362
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

00:35:48.582 --> 00:35:52.542
And He killed

00:35:56.572 --> 00:36:00.552
His own uncle, I should say;

00:36:02.532 --> 00:36:05.432
but for Him it is, was not important,

00:36:06.432 --> 00:36:09.502
so-called relations were not important.

00:36:10.472 --> 00:36:13.502
But what you see in our India specially,

00:36:14.382 --> 00:36:16.522
that relations are very important.

00:36:17.382 --> 00:36:21.472
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

00:36:21.562 --> 00:36:26.432
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

00:36:27.402 --> 00:36:32.432
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

00:36:32.532 --> 00:36:37.352
any one his progeny are honest.

00:36:37.462 --> 00:36:42.512
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

00:36:43.512 --> 00:36:47.492
that they don’t think is important.

00:36:48.372 --> 00:36:53.492
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

00:36:54.392 --> 00:36:58.532
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:00.422
I have seen our servants,

00:37:00.562 --> 00:37:03.522
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

00:37:04.482 --> 00:37:06.552
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

00:37:07.412 --> 00:37:09.392
it’s a matter of habit.

00:37:09.482 --> 00:37:14.562
They never steal anything – very surprising.

00:37:18.372 --> 00:37:20.512
Why, why don’t they steal?

00:37:21.492 --> 00:37:26.472
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

00:37:26.562 --> 00:37:32.352
They don’t want to have these horrible things

00:37:32.482 --> 00:37:34.532
that can put them in jail.

00:37:35.382 --> 00:37:37.432
But they don’t know,

00:37:37.512 --> 00:37:42.342
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

00:37:43.342 --> 00:37:48.462
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

00:37:49.362 --> 00:37:52.572
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

00:37:53.412 --> 00:37:55.352
very developed.

00:37:55.442 --> 00:38:03.392
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

00:38:03.482 --> 00:38:06.382
honest, and they are all honest.

00:38:06.542 --> 00:38:10.582
One of them may be not,

00:38:11.442 --> 00:38:14.582
but they have no respect for such a person,

00:38:15.482 --> 00:38:20.552
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

00:38:21.382 --> 00:38:24.432
Can you imagine these poor people?

00:38:24.542 --> 00:38:28.462
They have food once a day,

00:38:28.562 --> 00:38:32.452
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

00:38:32.562 --> 00:38:38.532
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

00:38:39.542 --> 00:38:42.572
your self-respect.

00:38:43.422 --> 00:38:45.482
Why should you steal,

00:38:45.582 --> 00:38:48.412
why should you have anything that is stolen,

00:38:48.542 --> 00:38:50.532
or why should you have anything that belongs

00:38:51.372 --> 00:38:53.482
to another person?

00:38:54.402 --> 00:38:56.512
If you have that self-respect within you,

00:38:57.372 --> 00:39:02.422
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

00:39:03.502 --> 00:39:06.552
When the servants can do that, why not people

00:39:07.412 --> 00:39:11.402
who are not that badly off?

00:39:11.512 --> 00:39:17.372
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

00:39:17.492 --> 00:39:20.392
which they develop, where their self-respect

00:39:20.512 --> 00:39:25.362
is much more important than all kinds of

00:39:25.462 --> 00:39:29.462
other things that may satisfy their greed.

00:39:29.572 --> 00:39:35.352
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

00:39:35.462 --> 00:39:38.342
It is never satisfied.

00:39:38.452 --> 00:39:41.342
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

00:39:41.442 --> 00:39:43.532
became very, very poor.

00:39:44.422 --> 00:39:47.412
So to them life has become hell.

00:39:47.532 --> 00:39:53.392
They can’t live with, without their great,

00:39:54.502 --> 00:39:59.482
I should say, pomp and show,

00:40:00.352 --> 00:40:03.362
but they don’t understand that it was false.

00:40:03.512 --> 00:40:08.442
They just go on feeling extremely

00:40:09.452 --> 00:40:13.492
downtrodden when they lose their money.

00:40:14.512 --> 00:40:18.492
Then there are people who want to have money;

00:40:19.352 --> 00:40:25.342
they’ll do anything but get money.

00:40:25.462 --> 00:40:31.492
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

00:40:32.362 --> 00:40:34.492
If you have your own powers,

00:40:35.342 --> 00:40:37.502
you don’t hanker after these powers.

00:40:37.502 --> 00:40:39.572
But they want to have power because

00:40:40.412 --> 00:40:44.492
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

00:40:44.572 --> 00:40:46.462
can you imagine?

00:40:46.562 --> 00:40:49.562
Where are human beings, at what level?

00:40:50.422 --> 00:40:53.382
At what level of evolution they are?

00:40:53.472 --> 00:40:58.582
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

00:40:59.492 --> 00:41:02.532
This is Nabhi Chakra

00:41:03.392 --> 00:41:05.432
which has to improve,

00:41:05.512 --> 00:41:08.532
which gives you satisfaction.

00:41:09.402 --> 00:41:12.362
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

00:41:12.462 --> 00:41:16.442
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

00:41:16.542 --> 00:41:20.342
That’s very important, to see

00:41:20.442 --> 00:41:24.572
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

00:41:26.372 --> 00:41:29.412
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

00:41:29.532 --> 00:41:33.452
but I think now the worst is this greed.

00:41:33.562 --> 00:41:38.472
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

00:41:38.562 --> 00:41:41.472
brought to its own level,

00:41:41.572 --> 00:41:45.422
then I think world will improve very much.

00:41:45.422 --> 00:41:47.352
May God bless you.
