02:05.512 --> 02:09.402
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

02:12.492 --> 02:18.372
as a very great personality.

02:19.522 --> 02:24.582
And you know why He came on this earth –

02:26.372 --> 02:34.462
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

02:36.342 --> 02:46.352
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

02:51.562 --> 02:59.372
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

02:59.502 --> 03:08.542
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

03:11.392 --> 03:13.482
And you had very great leaders

03:16.392 --> 03:18.432
who followed Him

03:21.392 --> 03:26.352
and who worshipped Him in a way,

03:27.462 --> 03:33.382
and created a new world of this America.

03:35.522 --> 03:38.512
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

03:39.552 --> 03:46.562
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

03:48.432 --> 03:52.472
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

03:53.362 --> 03:58.352
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

03:58.512 --> 04:01.442
about Shri Krishna:

04:04.582 --> 04:12.482
that He was a great master of wealth,

04:14.372 --> 04:20.382
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

04:20.512 --> 04:24.512
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

04:26.512 --> 04:30.522
They all forgot about it completely

04:31.432 --> 04:35.412
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

04:35.582 --> 04:45.442
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things – cheating, grabbing

04:45.582 --> 04:54.342
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

04:56.582 --> 05:01.462
He is Kubera. He doesn’t need any money, of course,

05:02.512 --> 05:05.552
He achieves money;

05:07.582 --> 05:10.352
and not only that,

05:10.542 --> 05:14.362
He is living, He lived in money.

05:15.382 --> 05:21.502
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

05:22.422 --> 05:27.422
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

05:27.582 --> 05:30.462
but it submerged in the water,

05:30.552 --> 05:37.442
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

05:37.562 --> 05:42.442
But now they have found out His house under the water,

05:42.542 --> 05:44.372
very deep waters,

05:45.342 --> 05:52.372
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

05:52.512 --> 05:56.542
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

05:57.412 --> 05:58.542
by dharma.

05:59.452 --> 06:04.392
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

06:04.552 --> 06:07.382
out of gold.

06:07.502 --> 06:11.472
It is still there and people have found it,

06:12.462 --> 06:15.502
but under the sea.

06:16.572 --> 06:21.342
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

06:22.362 --> 06:25.542
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

06:26.412 --> 06:28.412
it is still existing.

06:28.552 --> 06:33.432
That’s what it is, because He was the one

06:33.562 --> 06:37.442
who was for satya first – truth.

06:38.372 --> 06:44.492
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

06:45.382 --> 06:48.552
on the principle of truth.

06:49.472 --> 06:53.382
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

06:53.522 --> 07:00.422
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

07:00.582 --> 07:07.542
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

07:08.462 --> 07:12.532
He’s the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

07:13.502 --> 07:18.372
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

07:22.452 --> 07:25.342
I’m just the opposite of Him because I don’t understand

07:25.472 --> 07:27.412
money at all,

07:27.562 --> 07:32.342
but He’s looking after that part in My life.

07:32.542 --> 07:35.502
I’m so hopelessly bad –

07:36.412 --> 07:40.582
I don’t understand banking, I don’t understand money,

07:41.492 --> 07:46.412
I can’t even count money. Now what can you say to that?

07:47.412 --> 07:49.582
But He’s there to look after,

07:50.482 --> 07:54.572
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

07:55.582 --> 08:00.362
wealth, it’s all full of it.

08:01.362 --> 08:06.432
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

08:07.472 --> 08:10.522
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

08:11.392 --> 08:15.572
you don’t look for money.

08:16.462 --> 08:20.502
What happened in your country that some people got money.

08:21.372 --> 08:25.372
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

08:25.542 --> 08:28.382
They’re not satisfied people.

08:28.512 --> 08:33.542
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

08:35.482 --> 08:38.522
It is something very much human.

08:39.432 --> 08:42.572
After your human evolution,

08:43.442 --> 08:47.402
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

08:47.582 --> 08:54.582
then all these demeaning things like greed

08:56.422 --> 08:59.432
all disappear from your character.

08:59.432 --> 09:03.522
You don’t have that greed in you anymore

09:04.422 --> 09:09.352
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

09:09.482 --> 09:13.572
To you money is there, all right, but it’s not so important.

09:15.352 --> 09:23.472
It is just that you think don’t need it, and you’ll get it –

09:24.392 --> 09:27.582
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

09:28.452 --> 09:31.462
He’s doing all this, looking after you

09:32.342 --> 09:35.582
and helping you with money.

09:36.462 --> 09:39.552
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

09:40.442 --> 09:43.442
I don’t, never had any problem.

09:43.582 --> 09:51.432
So one thing, as Kubera He’s the supplier of wealth.

09:51.572 --> 09:55.362
He looks after people who don’t have money.

09:55.502 --> 09:59.402
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

09:59.562 --> 10:04.492
who enjoy the life of truth.

10:07.452 --> 10:19.522
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don’t.

10:20.562 --> 10:22.482
They have this much, they want to have more;

10:23.402 --> 10:25.492
that means they don’t enjoy the wealth.

10:26.362 --> 10:29.382
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

10:29.522 --> 10:34.432
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

10:34.552 --> 10:38.492
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

10:39.392 --> 10:41.492
whatever you have.

10:42.362 --> 10:45.442
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

10:45.552 --> 10:49.452
and you don’t hanker after something that is not there.

10:49.552 --> 10:52.362
Doesn’t matter if you don’t have.

10:53.382 --> 10:55.352
Many a times people have asked Me,

10:55.482 --> 11:00.492
“Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?”

11:00.572 --> 11:02.462
I said, “All right.

11:02.572 --> 11:05.412
Just now everybody’s trying to become Kuber.

11:05.542 --> 11:07.502
Let them learn a lesson,

11:08.352 --> 11:11.512
and then we will have the puja of Kubera.”

11:12.362 --> 11:17.402
And that’s why today I’ve agreed to have this puja.

11:18.582 --> 11:23.462
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

11:24.512 --> 11:28.492
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

11:28.582 --> 11:34.352
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

11:34.452 --> 11:37.582
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

11:38.412 --> 11:40.502
Where is that money gone?

11:41.342 --> 11:42.392
They’re very clever.

11:42.482 --> 11:45.582
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

11:45.582 --> 11:48.462
“My God,” I said, “the law is such that

11:48.542 --> 11:50.572
you can’t get out that money.”

11:51.432 --> 11:55.422
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

11:55.572 --> 12:01.402
I said, “But see now, they were never afraid

12:02.532 --> 12:05.572
that they'll be caught up,

12:06.502 --> 12:10.382
and they continued for so many years.

12:11.482 --> 12:14.422
But I’m sure one day

12:14.492 --> 12:18.512
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself.”

12:19.442 --> 12:24.432
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

12:24.532 --> 12:30.422
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

12:31.342 --> 12:35.352
what lies behind the money,

12:39.502 --> 12:45.342
what is the point of having money.

12:45.402 --> 12:47.382
This country had money.

12:47.502 --> 12:52.502
As a result so many good people came here to work,

12:53.352 --> 12:56.412
and you had so many complementary things.

12:57.342 --> 13:00.522
You had lots of people who have complemented,

13:01.362 --> 13:05.342
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

13:05.442 --> 13:09.422
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

13:09.492 --> 13:11.562
they were little bit lacking.

13:12.412 --> 13:15.392
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

13:15.482 --> 13:20.522
and also they were very focused people,

13:21.352 --> 13:23.452
so they worked it out very well.

13:23.562 --> 13:28.382
Also they respected people who came with brains.

13:28.502 --> 13:31.562
So this is what happens when you forget

13:32.452 --> 13:36.352
that truth is the main point.

13:36.432 --> 13:41.362
If you don’t have the truth, no use having money.

13:41.462 --> 13:46.342
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

13:46.422 --> 13:52.492
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

13:54.342 --> 13:57.512
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas – last year.

13:59.362 --> 14:01.462
And when we stopped at that airport

14:02.372 --> 14:05.382
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

14:05.542 --> 14:07.532
and they all were looking as if somebody’s dead

14:08.412 --> 14:09.522
in their family or what has happened.

14:10.442 --> 14:12.402
First I couldn’t understand.

14:12.522 --> 14:16.462
Then said, “Mother, they have lost all their money.”

14:20.552 --> 14:24.452
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

14:24.562 --> 14:26.582
they are crying because they have lost the money.

14:27.432 --> 14:29.462
What’s the use of such a money

14:29.572 --> 14:34.352
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

14:34.472 --> 14:39.582
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

14:40.492 --> 14:47.352
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

14:47.542 --> 14:52.432
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

14:52.572 --> 14:56.552
with that little money, they buy something.

14:57.422 --> 15:00.402
Then they think money is very important.

15:00.532 --> 15:03.442
You see, you can buy lots of things,

15:03.542 --> 15:06.452
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

15:07.432 --> 15:12.462
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

15:12.582 --> 15:17.352
after that mad money which makes you mad.

15:17.462 --> 15:21.562
It’s nice that at this juncture they have discovered

15:22.472 --> 15:25.542
the falsehood of this maya money.

15:26.432 --> 15:30.362
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

15:30.492 --> 15:36.352
and all their power of money was finished.

15:36.512 --> 15:41.462
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

15:42.502 --> 15:48.422
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

15:48.562 --> 15:54.582
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

15:56.362 --> 15:58.422
Now money matters:

15:58.562 --> 16:04.352
He first befools you that you run after it,

16:05.382 --> 16:09.522
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

16:10.382 --> 16:15.342
We have a story in our land, country, called “Sheikh Chili.”

16:15.452 --> 16:17.422
He got little money,

16:17.562 --> 16:23.402
and he got into the grab of this maya.

16:23.522 --> 16:26.562
So he thought, “I can do very well.”

16:27.412 --> 16:30.362
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

16:30.512 --> 16:34.382
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

16:34.472 --> 16:39.382
“Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

16:39.472 --> 16:42.432
which will I’ll sell and I’ll so much money,”

16:42.512 --> 16:44.442
and it was like that he was talking.

16:45.392 --> 16:50.572
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

16:51.432 --> 16:54.532
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

16:55.372 --> 16:58.422
and all the eggs broke.

16:58.532 --> 17:01.472
So the maya was over.

17:02.382 --> 17:05.442
This should happen early, but if it doesn’t happen

17:05.572 --> 17:10.442
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

17:10.582 --> 17:17.362
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

17:17.442 --> 17:20.412
complete vision of the destruction

17:20.532 --> 17:25.352
that can follow this maya business.

17:25.572 --> 17:30.412
It is something, such a insight

17:30.542 --> 17:33.442
that you don’t have to do anything with it.

17:34.382 --> 17:38.352
I'm different, I told you I don’t understand it at all.

17:38.462 --> 17:42.352
But even if you understand the value of money,

17:42.452 --> 17:46.362
even if you understand that money can bring

17:46.472 --> 17:51.432
lots of things to you, despite that you don’t look at it,

17:51.512 --> 17:57.502
just turn your face – that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

17:57.572 --> 18:01.422
To him it doesn’t matter, temperamentally.

18:01.502 --> 18:06.362
It’s not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

18:06.472 --> 18:11.402
temperamentally he doesn’t care for money,

18:11.492 --> 18:15.482
just because he’s above it.

18:15.582 --> 18:19.512
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

18:20.352 --> 18:23.542
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

18:24.372 --> 18:28.362
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

18:28.472 --> 18:30.472
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

18:30.552 --> 18:33.342
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

18:33.482 --> 18:37.462
But in India there’s a disease: as you have some here viruses,

18:38.342 --> 18:41.442
we have certain viruses in India also.

18:41.582 --> 18:44.352
So they still go on running after money,

18:44.472 --> 18:46.472
to them money is important.

18:47.382 --> 18:50.562
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

18:51.432 --> 18:54.482
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

18:55.362 --> 19:00.342
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money’s not so important.

19:00.452 --> 19:02.512
It’s not so important.

19:07.382 --> 19:16.372
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

19:17.532 --> 19:19.572
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

19:20.472 --> 19:24.482
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

19:25.352 --> 19:30.342
But Myself, you’ll be amazed, I’m so nervous or I should say

19:30.422 --> 19:36.462
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

19:36.572 --> 19:41.442
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

19:43.372 --> 19:45.582
Come here and fix it please.

19:51.372 --> 19:54.512
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

19:59.442 --> 20:03.432
Correct, now all right.

20:05.532 --> 20:13.532
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

20:21.432 --> 20:23.552
to their spirit,

20:24.452 --> 20:30.432
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

20:30.572 --> 20:37.402
That enjoyment once you get it, you don’t fall to your greed.

20:38.442 --> 20:40.372
This is something

20:40.542 --> 20:45.342
very, very simple,

20:45.522 --> 20:48.422
but sometimes you don’t do it.

20:48.562 --> 20:54.352
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

20:54.472 --> 20:57.462
maybe aeroplane, I don’t know what – whatever it is.

20:58.352 --> 21:02.362
It’s a headache to have too many cars, isn’t it?

21:03.522 --> 21:05.482
But people have;

21:06.372 --> 21:08.402
they think by that people are impressed,

21:08.522 --> 21:11.492
and they think no end of themselves or not – nothing.

21:12.412 --> 21:15.562
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

21:16.422 --> 21:18.542
What do you get out of it?

21:19.402 --> 21:24.462
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

21:24.572 --> 21:26.442
more than anything else.

21:27.352 --> 21:28.562
He doesn’t want to possess anything.

21:29.432 --> 21:32.362
It’s a headache to possess things also.

21:32.502 --> 21:36.452
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

21:37.442 --> 21:40.522
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

21:41.412 --> 21:43.542
you’ll have never a problem of money.

21:44.412 --> 21:47.422
On the contrary, you’ll know how to stop it.

21:47.552 --> 21:51.562
So far as I am concerned,

21:52.422 --> 21:56.482
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

21:57.362 --> 21:59.452
because I don’t know from where it works out,

21:59.572 --> 22:05.482
how it works out, without any effort.

22:07.482 --> 22:12.582
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

22:13.462 --> 22:15.542
temperamentally.

22:16.462 --> 22:23.462
But it is the, I don’t know what is the cause of this effect.

22:25.392 --> 22:29.352
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

22:29.502 --> 22:33.562
it will sell at least ten times more.

22:34.452 --> 22:38.502
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don’t know how.

22:39.562 --> 22:45.472
It’s very surprising – automatically.

22:46.472 --> 22:53.342
I’ll buy something very small, then I find it’s very expensive.

22:53.532 --> 22:58.562
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

22:59.482 --> 23:03.502
So what I have to tell you is this,

23:04.412 --> 23:09.532
that you should not worry about your financial situations

23:10.382 --> 23:12.372
at all.

23:12.492 --> 23:14.432
Do not go on calculating,

23:14.552 --> 23:19.342
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

23:19.462 --> 23:21.342
what you have to do with your money,

23:21.452 --> 23:22.482
where you should invest.

23:23.382 --> 23:27.342
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

23:27.512 --> 23:31.432
There’s no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

23:31.562 --> 23:35.342
It all works automatically.

23:35.452 --> 23:39.432
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

23:39.572 --> 23:43.392
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

23:43.552 --> 23:47.482
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

23:48.392 --> 23:56.572
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

23:58.402 --> 24:01.492
You don’t know what is greed is.

24:02.582 --> 24:07.462
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

24:07.572 --> 24:10.432
generous.

24:10.572 --> 24:15.362
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

24:15.492 --> 24:18.462
That may be another way of doing it.

24:19.452 --> 24:25.392
Supposing you get something in your house

24:27.382 --> 24:29.412
and you think it is too much.

24:30.342 --> 24:33.372
Not to get rid of it but just to think it’s too much,

24:33.372 --> 24:35.392
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

24:35.492 --> 24:37.392
whom can you give?

24:37.572 --> 24:39.582
And immediately you’ll remember,

24:40.442 --> 24:44.442
“Oh, that person doesn’t have this. Let me give him this.”

24:45.342 --> 24:48.502
And if you give him he’ll be so thankful, so thankful,

24:49.382 --> 24:52.452
and he’ll say all kinds of nice things to you

24:53.342 --> 24:57.342
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

25:00.572 --> 25:06.432
And it’s surprising how joy-giving it is,

25:06.552 --> 25:11.382
how people like your generosity.

25:11.502 --> 25:14.502
So you have to be generous, just generous;

25:15.372 --> 25:17.472
not with yourself, but with others.

25:18.362 --> 25:23.392
As much as possible, be generous.

25:24.452 --> 25:32.432
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

25:32.552 --> 25:35.432
of your love.

25:35.552 --> 25:39.532
Many a times it has happened with Me

25:40.412 --> 25:44.532
that I saw somebody needed something,

25:46.362 --> 25:48.422
and kept it in My mind.

25:48.582 --> 25:52.432
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

25:53.352 --> 25:58.482
And the amount of love that person gave Me

25:59.362 --> 26:01.382
was thousand time more

26:01.522 --> 26:09.342
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

26:09.472 --> 26:13.442
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

26:13.542 --> 26:18.382
many people, “Mother gave me this. Mother gave me.”

26:18.492 --> 26:20.562
I mean, I was surprised.

26:21.422 --> 26:23.522
Then they asked Me, “Mother, how did You give him?”

26:24.392 --> 26:26.512
I said, “Just out of love.”

26:27.392 --> 26:30.422
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

26:30.512 --> 26:33.372
“What a generosity is!”

26:33.492 --> 26:37.562
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

26:39.442 --> 26:43.342
After all it’s a headache to have too many things.

26:43.452 --> 26:47.552
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

26:48.402 --> 26:50.522
If you do that,

26:51.412 --> 26:56.422
you’ll be know how much they’ll be appreciative of you.

26:57.432 --> 27:04.542
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

27:06.342 --> 27:11.462
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

27:12.482 --> 27:17.492
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

27:18.352 --> 27:22.452
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

27:23.572 --> 27:25.582
You’ll be amazed how these people are living,

27:26.452 --> 27:28.372
in what conditions.

27:28.482 --> 27:32.452
“Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?”

27:33.432 --> 27:36.402
That will be just shocking.

27:36.512 --> 27:39.462
Sometimes, you see, you see people

27:40.572 --> 27:44.492
in India also in a very bad condition.

27:45.352 --> 27:47.512
Once I went to Calcutta

27:49.432 --> 27:54.542
and I was so – somehow or other you see by chance,

27:55.402 --> 28:00.382
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

28:00.562 --> 28:05.492
very great poverty, even the children.

28:06.362 --> 28:09.552
And you’ll be amazed, for days together I wouldn’t eat My food.

28:10.442 --> 28:14.382
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn’t know

28:14.482 --> 28:16.442
what to do.

28:16.552 --> 28:19.562
Because I felt, “What is this?

28:20.462 --> 28:23.462
Why these people are so poor?”

28:23.562 --> 28:27.462
And I was helpless so I was crying,

28:27.552 --> 28:33.442
that one day I should try to do something for them.

28:33.562 --> 28:38.352
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

28:38.572 --> 28:47.402
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

28:48.432 --> 28:50.462
all kinds of things.

28:52.422 --> 28:57.552
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

28:59.412 --> 29:06.412
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

29:07.422 --> 29:09.482
I also sold some of My things,

29:10.352 --> 29:14.472
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

29:15.352 --> 29:18.502
so joy-giving to be generous.

29:19.482 --> 29:26.402
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

29:26.572 --> 29:29.512
That is the quality of Kubera.

29:30.422 --> 29:34.412
He’s an extremely generous personality,

29:35.422 --> 29:39.482
and that’s what’s personality you should be.

29:40.362 --> 29:43.492
So, I’ve seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

29:44.492 --> 29:50.352
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow –

29:50.482 --> 29:53.442
so far, so far.

29:54.402 --> 29:59.582
But I’m sure one day will come when we’ll have people

30:00.442 --> 30:04.352
of very high quality.

30:04.462 --> 30:08.422
In Sahaja Yoga we don’t say like other cults say that

30:08.532 --> 30:14.472
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

30:15.352 --> 30:20.582
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything – nothing of the kind.

30:21.442 --> 30:24.462
Don’t give up anything.

30:24.562 --> 30:28.562
You have to give up from your heart.

30:29.442 --> 30:31.562
Just it should happen in your personality;

30:32.412 --> 30:34.552
don’t have to give up.

30:35.432 --> 30:44.352
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

30:45.362 --> 30:52.402
you’ll not even think of grabbing someone.

30:53.492 --> 30:56.442
On the contrary,

30:56.582 --> 30:59.532
you would like to give up everything.

31:00.402 --> 31:03.402
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

31:04.452 --> 31:07.472
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

31:08.342 --> 31:12.482
He said, “No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed.”

31:13.342 --> 31:15.452
So one day a thief came

31:16.342 --> 31:19.502
and he took away his gramophone – in the old times,

31:20.352 --> 31:23.532
these big horn ones – he took away.

31:24.442 --> 31:27.502
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

31:28.382 --> 31:29.442
So My mother asked him,

31:29.542 --> 31:31.472
“Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?”

31:32.352 --> 31:35.462
“No, I’m only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

31:35.582 --> 31:42.452
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records.”

31:43.452 --> 31:46.582
So My mother said, “All right, what should we do?

31:47.452 --> 31:50.402
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

31:50.522 --> 31:53.552
your records?”

31:55.492 --> 32:01.412
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

32:01.522 --> 32:04.562
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

32:05.422 --> 32:09.562
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

32:10.442 --> 32:15.372
But if you force it through religion,

32:15.512 --> 32:20.342
through any such ideas that “you give up that, you give” –

32:20.472 --> 32:23.352
don’t have to give up.

32:23.482 --> 32:27.482
You give up from within.

32:28.432 --> 32:32.462
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

32:32.582 --> 32:36.402
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

32:36.542 --> 32:41.542
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

32:42.442 --> 32:46.542
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

32:47.432 --> 32:51.382
but they lack generosity.

32:51.502 --> 32:54.502
That is another quality of Kubera.

32:55.372 --> 32:58.532
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

32:59.402 --> 33:03.392
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

33:03.492 --> 33:06.372
because the way He manages banks, you know,

33:06.472 --> 33:10.422
it seems to Me that He’s sitting on top of them,

33:10.542 --> 33:15.352
and that’s why still in the banks there is no problem.

33:15.502 --> 33:16.552
I don’t know.

33:17.422 --> 33:23.432
But He’s a very clever person,

33:25.582 --> 33:27.562
very intelligent,

33:28.432 --> 33:30.452
very alert,

33:31.492 --> 33:36.492
which is important if you have to deal with money –

33:37.542 --> 33:42.392
though He was absolutely detached from money.

33:43.352 --> 33:46.362
And just see His life, what He did.

33:46.472 --> 33:51.382
He lived in childhood with His guru,

33:51.542 --> 33:53.502
and He used to take

33:54.382 --> 34:03.462
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

34:05.472 --> 34:11.472
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

34:14.362 --> 34:18.572
He was playing with the boys

34:19.422 --> 34:23.572
who were looking after the cows in a very,

34:24.472 --> 34:27.412
I mean, ordinary family.

34:31.392 --> 34:34.462
He never hankered after money.

34:35.432 --> 34:36.572
He used to steal,

34:38.562 --> 34:44.362
used to steal the butter,

34:44.552 --> 34:50.462
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa’s

34:54.462 --> 34:57.392
military people.

34:58.342 --> 35:00.442
So He used to eat that,

35:00.542 --> 35:04.372
so that this lady should not give it to them.

35:04.512 --> 35:08.432
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

35:08.552 --> 35:15.452
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

35:16.342 --> 35:19.552
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

35:20.432 --> 35:22.562
to these horrible soldiers,

35:23.422 --> 35:28.412
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

35:28.522 --> 35:31.462
In everything that He did,

35:32.342 --> 35:37.492
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

35:39.342 --> 35:44.362
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

35:48.582 --> 35:52.542
And He killed

35:56.572 --> 36:00.552
His own uncle, I should say;

36:02.532 --> 36:05.432
but for Him it is, was not important,

36:06.432 --> 36:09.502
so-called relations were not important.

36:10.472 --> 36:13.502
But what you see in our India specially,

36:14.382 --> 36:16.522
that relations are very important.

36:17.382 --> 36:21.472
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

36:21.562 --> 36:26.432
all of them are thieves – can you imagine?

36:27.402 --> 36:32.432
I haven’t seen in a family if there’s one person who is a thief,

36:32.532 --> 36:37.352
any one his progeny are honest.

36:37.462 --> 36:42.512
It’s a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

36:43.512 --> 36:47.492
that they don’t think is important.

36:48.372 --> 36:53.492
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

36:54.392 --> 36:58.532
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

36:59.342 --> 37:00.422
I have seen our servants,

37:00.562 --> 37:03.522
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

37:04.482 --> 37:06.552
I don’t know, they have no reasoning for it,

37:07.412 --> 37:09.392
it’s a matter of habit.

37:09.482 --> 37:14.562
They never steal anything – very surprising.

37:18.372 --> 37:20.512
Why, why don’t they steal?

37:21.492 --> 37:26.472
They’re happy with their lives, they don’t want to change it.

37:26.562 --> 37:32.352
They don’t want to have these horrible things

37:32.482 --> 37:34.532
that can put them in jail.

37:35.382 --> 37:37.432
But they don’t know,

37:37.512 --> 37:42.342
they don’t even think about it; just they just don’t do it.

37:43.342 --> 37:48.462
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

37:49.362 --> 37:52.572
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

37:53.412 --> 37:55.352
very developed.

37:55.442 --> 38:03.392
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

38:03.482 --> 38:06.382
honest, and they are all honest.

38:06.542 --> 38:10.582
One of them may be not,

38:11.442 --> 38:14.582
but they have no respect for such a person,

38:15.482 --> 38:20.552
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

38:21.382 --> 38:24.432
Can you imagine these poor people?

38:24.542 --> 38:28.462
They have food once a day,

38:28.562 --> 38:32.452
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

38:32.562 --> 38:38.532
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

38:39.542 --> 38:42.572
your self-respect.

38:43.422 --> 38:45.482
Why should you steal,

38:45.582 --> 38:48.412
why should you have anything that is stolen,

38:48.542 --> 38:50.532
or why should you have anything that belongs

38:51.372 --> 38:53.482
to another person?

38:54.402 --> 38:56.512
If you have that self-respect within you,

38:57.372 --> 39:02.422
you won’t touch anything that is not yours.

39:03.502 --> 39:06.552
When the servants can do that, why not people

39:07.412 --> 39:11.402
who are not that badly off?

39:11.512 --> 39:17.372
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

39:17.492 --> 39:20.392
which they develop, where their self-respect

39:20.512 --> 39:25.362
is much more important than all kinds of

39:25.462 --> 39:29.462
other things that may satisfy their greed.

39:29.572 --> 39:35.352
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

39:35.462 --> 39:38.342
It is never satisfied.

39:38.452 --> 39:41.342
I’ve seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

39:41.442 --> 39:43.532
became very, very poor.

39:44.422 --> 39:47.412
So to them life has become hell.

39:47.532 --> 39:53.392
They can’t live with, without their great,

39:54.502 --> 39:59.482
I should say, pomp and show,

40:00.352 --> 40:03.362
but they don’t understand that it was false.

40:03.512 --> 40:08.442
They just go on feeling extremely

40:09.452 --> 40:13.492
downtrodden when they lose their money.

40:14.512 --> 40:18.492
Then there are people who want to have money;

40:19.352 --> 40:25.342
they’ll do anything but get money.

40:25.462 --> 40:31.492
It’s a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

40:32.362 --> 40:34.492
If you have your own powers,

40:35.342 --> 40:37.502
you don’t hanker after these powers.

40:37.502 --> 40:39.572
But they want to have power because

40:40.412 --> 40:44.492
they want to have money, and they get power with money –

40:44.572 --> 40:46.462
can you imagine?

40:46.562 --> 40:49.562
Where are human beings, at what level?

40:50.422 --> 40:53.382
At what level of evolution they are?

40:53.472 --> 40:58.582
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

40:59.492 --> 41:02.532
This is Nabhi Chakra

41:03.392 --> 41:05.432
which has to improve,

41:05.512 --> 41:08.532
which gives you satisfaction.

41:09.402 --> 41:12.362
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

41:12.462 --> 41:16.442
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

41:16.542 --> 41:20.342
That’s very important, to see

41:20.442 --> 41:24.572
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

41:26.372 --> 41:29.412
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

41:29.532 --> 41:33.452
but I think now the worst is this greed.

41:33.562 --> 41:38.472
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

41:38.562 --> 41:41.472
brought to its own level,

41:41.572 --> 41:45.422
then I think world will improve very much.

41:45.422 --> 41:47.352
May God bless you.
