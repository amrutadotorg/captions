00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.833
Shall I talk in Hindi? I will speak in English,

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.944
Many people have come from different places. (Marathi)

00:05:54.459 --> 00:05:56.530
All are ready for puja.

00:05:57.808 --> 00:06:00.630
sit, sit, sit, you should sit. (Marathi)

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:16.901
Many people have always asked me,

00:06:18.862 --> 00:06:21.560
that why God created this Universe.

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:28.168
Of course, we are not supposed to ask questions to God.

00:06:29.547 --> 00:06:34.707
It’s easy to ask questions to Mataji when She is giving a lecture.

00:06:35.562 --> 00:06:39.151
But God, is a person who is beyond questions.

00:06:40.212 --> 00:06:42.338
And why He created Universe,

00:06:42.757 --> 00:06:46.043
is something like, why I wore all these ornaments.

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.922
As I am not habituated of wearing ornaments,

00:06:52.131 --> 00:06:54.161
but I have to do it.

00:06:58.593 --> 00:07:01.319
I have to do it just to please you people,

00:07:02.591 --> 00:07:05.713
or we can say that God created this earth,

00:07:06.233 --> 00:07:08.354
just to please His own children,

00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:11.154
just to make them happy,

00:07:12.035 --> 00:07:15.435
just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God,

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:18.397
to give all that what He has got.

00:07:19.472 --> 00:07:20.901
So He had to create,

00:07:21.738 --> 00:07:23.700
this creation in such a way,

00:07:24.922 --> 00:07:25.994
that,

00:07:27.428 --> 00:07:28.481
He could

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:31.742
create His own image,

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:34.959
reflect it,

00:07:36.243 --> 00:07:39.223
and make it, enjoy itself.

00:07:44.837 --> 00:07:46.690
It’s a very mutual

00:07:47.823 --> 00:07:49.032
appreciation,

00:07:51.385 --> 00:07:54.740
as we call it, andolan.

00:07:58.827 --> 00:08:03.098
Whatever He does for us, is for His own pleasures.

00:08:05.566 --> 00:08:10.941
But the beauty of it is that your pleasure is His pleasure.

00:08:12.594 --> 00:08:14.671
And the other way round is, His pleasure,

00:08:14.931 --> 00:08:17.527
should be your pleasure, too.

00:08:19.022 --> 00:08:20.392
Once that becomes

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:26.543
the fact, that the pleasure of God becomes your pleasure,

00:08:28.681 --> 00:08:33.728
you enter into that beautiful arena of

00:08:34.941 --> 00:08:37.824
heavenly joy, "swargiya anand".

00:08:41.023 --> 00:08:43.782
Only if it is one sided

00:08:45.553 --> 00:08:48.553
enterprise or one-sided effort,

00:08:50.427 --> 00:08:51.655
it gets lost.

00:08:52.668 --> 00:08:54.540
Human efforts are one-sided.

00:08:56.082 --> 00:08:59.288
But God’s efforts are such that they cannot,

00:08:59.708 --> 00:09:02.718
be enjoyed unless and until they are reflected by.

00:09:03.755 --> 00:09:05.717
So whatever He has given us,

00:09:06.812 --> 00:09:08.574
we cannot count them,

00:09:10.316 --> 00:09:12.214
we can only say they are blessings.

00:09:12.953 --> 00:09:15.286
because it’s an abstract way of saying things,

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.675
That is the blessing of God,

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:22.522
that He has given all the blessings.

00:09:24.014 --> 00:09:26.732
It’s an abstract thing, because we cannot count,

00:09:27.282 --> 00:09:28.908
we cannot give it a form,

00:09:29.328 --> 00:09:31.853
we cannot say, what He has done for us.

00:09:35.609 --> 00:09:40.529
And when this joy of His creation is felt in our heart,

00:09:41.633 --> 00:09:44.780
once we start enjoying that joy within ourselves,

00:09:45.822 --> 00:09:49.410
then it becomes a complete picture.

00:09:52.658 --> 00:09:55.392
When it is complete, you cannot describe it,

00:09:56.494 --> 00:09:58.196
because it is not relative.

00:09:59.695 --> 00:10:01.216
You can just enjoy it.

00:10:02.645 --> 00:10:08.438
And that is how the depth of enjoyment is described,

00:10:08.993 --> 00:10:11.611
that at that depth, what are we to say?

00:10:12.616 --> 00:10:13.691
We are lost.

00:10:14.829 --> 00:10:19.096
The drop has become the ocean and the ocean has become the drop.

00:10:20.802 --> 00:10:23.068
First the ocean becomes the drop,

00:10:23.867 --> 00:10:25.936
and then drop becomes the ocean.

00:10:26.473 --> 00:10:29.407
And then the ocean tries to become the drop.

00:10:31.817 --> 00:10:35.335
It’s a beautiful system of give and take,

00:10:36.994 --> 00:10:39.483
which can only be appreciated by people

00:10:40.847 --> 00:10:44.197
who have tasted the nectar,

00:10:44.954 --> 00:10:46.962
of the beauty of God’s love.

00:10:47.373 --> 00:10:49.398
It’s very easy to say there is no God.

00:10:49.819 --> 00:10:51.732
It’s the easiest thing to say.

00:10:53.861 --> 00:10:57.543
But it is even easier to enjoy God than that.

00:10:59.271 --> 00:11:03.374
Is the easiest thing to enjoy Him because He is so available.

00:11:04.073 --> 00:11:05.215
He is so anxious.

00:11:05.573 --> 00:11:08.350
The whole purpose of creation is to give you joy,

00:11:08.906 --> 00:11:10.721
to give you happiness.

00:11:12.049 --> 00:11:14.834
As today, when I had to go to the bank,

00:11:16.343 --> 00:11:19.977
I was wondering, “I have never worn these ornaments anytime in life,

00:11:20.284 --> 00:11:23.220
and today as the time has come and I have to wear.

00:11:23.468 --> 00:11:24.816
I just thought of it.

00:11:25.812 --> 00:11:29.383
“It’s just for my children”, If I have to wear them,

00:11:30.049 --> 00:11:31.369
what does it matter?

00:11:33.641 --> 00:11:37.115
Just to make them happy, what does it matter?

00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:41.299
If they feel happy, then My happiness is complete.

00:11:42.614 --> 00:11:45.638
But you felt for Me, that I should wear,

00:11:45.947 --> 00:11:51.105
itself shows that you wanted to see them on Me.

00:11:51.833 --> 00:11:55.063
Is also suggestive of your very subtle bhakti,

00:11:55.657 --> 00:11:57.771
very subtle love for your Mother.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:00.876
In these modern times,

00:12:01.493 --> 00:12:04.606
to have such bhaktas, itself is a big blessing for Me.

00:12:05.432 --> 00:12:08.950
So as you say, “Mother, bless us,” I say, “You also bless Me.

00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:10.631
You have already blessed me

00:12:10.832 --> 00:12:13.963
by this beautiful arrangement that you have made,

00:12:15.419 --> 00:12:17.676
the way you have put yourself,

00:12:18.752 --> 00:12:22.138
surrendered yourself for this great puja.

00:12:23.786 --> 00:12:30.042
Because all is such an interdependent

00:12:32.279 --> 00:12:33.373
process.

00:12:34.274 --> 00:12:39.350
You do the puja, I can’t do the puja, You have to do the puja.

00:12:40.094 --> 00:12:43.118
When you do the puja, the chakras are awakened.

00:12:45.558 --> 00:12:48.948
Mine are awakened, but in you they are awakened.

00:12:50.142 --> 00:12:54.311
Now how to explain to people what is the importance of puja is.

00:12:55.900 --> 00:12:57.494
If you have not tasted,

00:12:59.948 --> 00:13:03.483
the fruit of a puja it is impossible to explain.

00:13:06.525 --> 00:13:10.850
It is at a higher level only one can understand all these things.

00:13:11.835 --> 00:13:15.889
But, so far whatever was done was at such a lower level

00:13:16.257 --> 00:13:21.158
by such low type of people that everything became,

00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:24.524
absolutely unholy.

00:13:25.875 --> 00:13:27.461
It was all unholy doing

00:13:28.009 --> 00:13:34.018
and because of that unholy doing God himself is unhappy.

00:13:37.769 --> 00:13:40.503
So, He has created this Universe,

00:13:41.425 --> 00:13:45.100
to create realized souls, not to create useless people,

00:13:45.585 --> 00:13:49.195
not to create people, who do not believe in God,

00:13:49.579 --> 00:13:53.184
who do not believe in higher life,

00:13:53.883 --> 00:13:59.438
who do not believe in leading a life of purity.

00:14:01.771 --> 00:14:04.185
He never created this Universe for them.

00:14:04.560 --> 00:14:08.288
They are just existing, just like dead people.

00:14:08.701 --> 00:14:10.501
They are not living people.

00:14:11.524 --> 00:14:18.064
So those who believe in God, those who worship Him, with all purity,

00:14:18.815 --> 00:14:22.720
are actually, in a way, giving blessings to God

00:14:22.934 --> 00:14:25.172
because it is so pleasurable for Him to see,

00:14:25.521 --> 00:14:27.071
that they have understood,

00:14:27.516 --> 00:14:31.293
that they have felt it, that they have liked it.

00:14:33.408 --> 00:14:36.289
Sahaj Yogis also, some of them have problems,

00:14:37.326 --> 00:14:38.289
doesn’t matter.

00:14:38.690 --> 00:14:43.150
But as long as the desire is pure, your Kundalini is pure,

00:14:44.293 --> 00:14:47.028
as long as you feel you that you have to do,

00:14:47.719 --> 00:14:49.933
your ascent in a proper way,

00:14:51.814 --> 00:14:53.321
in a surrendered way,

00:14:53.956 --> 00:14:59.489
everything is going to become a complete beautiful picture.

00:15:00.730 --> 00:15:04.182
And to create this elevated,

00:15:07.222 --> 00:15:13.152
Kingdom of God, within our heart and without,

00:15:14.197 --> 00:15:17.145
one has to know that

00:15:18.253 --> 00:15:21.482
God’s efforts are absolutely,

00:15:23.840 --> 00:15:24.982
complete.

00:15:25.817 --> 00:15:27.083
He has made you.

00:15:29.205 --> 00:15:35.789
Now only little less is there, It’s from the other side.

00:15:36.543 --> 00:15:39.416
He has created this universe so beautifully,

00:15:40.737 --> 00:15:43.507
and after creating that beautiful universe,

00:15:44.665 --> 00:15:49.942
that universe has to reflect God fully. That’s all.

00:15:52.069 --> 00:15:54.408
So the fifty percent job is done.

00:15:55.331 --> 00:15:57.798
Only other fifty percent job you have to do.

00:15:58.085 --> 00:16:00.308
You should not worry if there are people,

00:16:00.562 --> 00:16:02.467
who are not interested in Sahaj Yog,

00:16:02.626 --> 00:16:04.678
those who are not going to do meditation,

00:16:04.829 --> 00:16:06.749
those who are not going to do puja,

00:16:06.952 --> 00:16:09.813
those who do not enjoy this higher life.

00:16:10.210 --> 00:16:11.829
Just don’t worry about them.

00:16:12.369 --> 00:16:15.011
But you must know that you are special people,

00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:19.392
and that you have to create the nucleus,

00:16:20.321 --> 00:16:23.638
the complete body of that part,

00:16:25.329 --> 00:16:29.844
which is going to complete this work of great faith.

00:16:31.998 --> 00:16:35.526
Today I am so enamoured

00:16:37.115 --> 00:16:41.400
that the speed of everything has come down to zero for Me now.

00:16:43.314 --> 00:16:46.758
Nothing is moving, there is no gati in Me now left,

00:16:48.359 --> 00:16:53.401
So enamoured and overwhelmed by your celebration,

00:16:54.176 --> 00:16:55.541
by your kindness,

00:16:57.685 --> 00:17:00.882
that I just don’t know how to express Myself.

00:17:04.507 --> 00:17:06.927
All this is suggestive,

00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:12.763
of tremendous depth and gratitude in your hearts,

00:17:13.819 --> 00:17:16.763
for something I have done nothing whatsoever.

00:17:18.702 --> 00:17:21.263
I have done nothing, because I have not achieved anything

00:17:21.464 --> 00:17:25.084
in life Myself, I was what I am, I will be the same.

00:17:26.283 --> 00:17:29.109
I have not done any tapasya or anything.

00:17:30.690 --> 00:17:37.109
I have not walked even an inch to achieve my goal.

00:17:39.130 --> 00:17:41.701
It’s you who have prepared yourself,

00:17:42.709 --> 00:17:45.114
who have come closer and closer,

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:48.718
just like a ready

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:56.781
lamp, a Deepak, and got yourself ignited,

00:17:57.355 --> 00:18:00.496
enlightened yourself, because of your preparation.

00:18:01.504 --> 00:18:03.980
It’s only your own doing,

00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:09.985
which has given this light everywhere.

00:18:11.405 --> 00:18:15.379
You know very well that light cannot spread in vacuum.

00:18:15.769 --> 00:18:16.863
It cannot spread.

00:18:17.983 --> 00:18:20.387
If there is vacuum, light cannot spread.

00:18:21.343 --> 00:18:27.295
That’s why without the Sahaj Yogis, I have no existence at all.

00:18:27.875 --> 00:18:29.112
I don’t exist.

00:18:29.654 --> 00:18:32.582
My whole existence is here because of you.

00:18:33.273 --> 00:18:35.415
I have no meaning, I have no work.

00:18:35.797 --> 00:18:39.345
I don’t do any work at all, I am the one who is the laziest

00:18:40.210 --> 00:18:42.567
and who doesn’t do any work whatsoever.

00:18:42.796 --> 00:18:46.859
It’s only you who have achieved it.

00:18:47.262 --> 00:18:49.343
It is you who have raised yourself.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.440
Actually, your birthdays must be celebrated, instead of Mine,

00:18:53.913 --> 00:18:57.773
because neither I am getting old nor young, I am just the same.

00:18:58.407 --> 00:19:00.827
There is no difference in anyway.

00:19:01.315 --> 00:19:03.326
And I think it should be,

00:19:03.527 --> 00:19:07.019
the birthday of Sahaj Yoga which should be celebrated today.

00:19:07.496 --> 00:19:09.212
That we can say today,

00:19:10.022 --> 00:19:13.706
that it is about twelve years ten months,

00:19:14.584 --> 00:19:18.037
that Sahaj Yoga was started on a public basis,

00:19:18.321 --> 00:19:23.418
though I started it long time back I don’t know how many years back.

00:19:25.880 --> 00:19:31.001
So, at this stage, we have to understand that

00:19:31.644 --> 00:19:33.717
puja is an abstract,

00:19:34.845 --> 00:19:38.241
achievement which can only be experienced,

00:19:38.662 --> 00:19:42.453
and all of you should sit with that feeling,

00:19:42.779 --> 00:19:45.159
that we are going to achieve,

00:19:48.985 --> 00:19:50.627
nothingness within us.

00:19:53.422 --> 00:19:55.638
egoless, egolessness,

00:19:56.985 --> 00:19:59.585
emptiness, cleansing,

00:20:00.649 --> 00:20:06.133
so that the light of love should flood all the areas within us.

00:20:09.768 --> 00:20:11.791
And that is only possible,

00:20:12.895 --> 00:20:16.228
when, of course, the chakras are to be awakened.

00:20:17.422 --> 00:20:20.851
That’s going to work out and also that,

00:20:21.874 --> 00:20:24.662
you should open out your hearts completely.

00:20:25.102 --> 00:20:26.717
Not to doubt anything,

00:20:27.553 --> 00:20:30.583
not to think about anything, but just open your hearts.

00:20:31.676 --> 00:20:35.778
just receive it, with complete faith and understanding.

00:20:42.515 --> 00:20:45.188
You have people from all over the countries,

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.800
so many countries, all the world is represented here.

00:20:51.821 --> 00:20:53.007
I feel,

00:20:54.947 --> 00:20:58.736
that already we have touched every corner of the world.

00:21:01.048 --> 00:21:02.440
On this day,

00:21:02.948 --> 00:21:05.040
only thing we have to declare that,

00:21:05.286 --> 00:21:08.984
let Sahaja Yoga become a Mahayoga, in its full way.

00:21:09.282 --> 00:21:12.480
That everybody in the whole world should recognize

00:21:13.036 --> 00:21:16.115
that Sahaj Yoga is the only way people can,

00:21:17.092 --> 00:21:20.698
rise in their evolution, and a new world can be created.

00:21:24.143 --> 00:21:28.107
please sit down for two minutes, did you hear? sit down (Marathi)

00:21:33.214 --> 00:21:35.185
And this kind of a

00:21:36.889 --> 00:21:37.991
development,

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.954
which is a collective development,

00:21:42.953 --> 00:21:46.757
which is not of outer world but of the inner world,

00:21:48.151 --> 00:21:50.026
which generate the roots,

00:21:53.334 --> 00:21:58.751
of this creation into a new dimension,

00:22:00.037 --> 00:22:02.553
into a new personality,

00:22:05.338 --> 00:22:06.338
because,

00:22:07.730 --> 00:22:11.609
by that time, the roots would have reached the source,

00:22:12.225 --> 00:22:14.351
source of this Divine love,

00:22:15.146 --> 00:22:19.570
of this All-pervading Power of this Brahmashakti.

00:22:21.699 --> 00:22:26.640
Today I would request you, that you all should take a vow,

00:22:27.092 --> 00:22:30.645
that all of you will try to bring more people to Sahaj Yoga

00:22:31.002 --> 00:22:35.399
and try to save as many as possible, through all your efforts.

00:22:36.226 --> 00:22:39.977
That’s the only thing, if you can give me on My birthday,

00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.160
I’ll be very much thankful.

00:22:45.684 --> 00:22:47.580
May God bless you all.

00:22:53.954 --> 00:22:57.548
In Maharashtra, you can't live without speaking Marathi.

00:22:58.009 --> 00:23:00.255
You should speak a little Marathi,

00:23:01.788 --> 00:23:04.185
And the fact that we have survived for seven years,

00:23:04.511 --> 00:23:07.139
means, we've managed somehow.

00:23:10.473 --> 00:23:13.750
AAAA, the speciality of Marathas,

00:23:16.357 --> 00:23:18.443
Saints who were born in this land,

00:23:18.768 --> 00:23:22.054
have poured water on their foreheads.

00:23:23.935 --> 00:23:25.611
saints have preached a lot,

00:23:26.263 --> 00:23:30.564
and Gods have erected 3 and a half peethas here.

00:23:33.117 --> 00:23:35.219
Ashtavinayaks are residing here,

00:23:35.502 --> 00:23:36.969
by receiving all this,

00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:41.067
if people of Maharashtra do not achieve divinity,

00:23:41.432 --> 00:23:45.021
then people of Maharashtra will be answerable to everyone.

00:23:45.857 --> 00:23:50.087
one should keep in mind, lot of effort has been done in Maharashtra.

00:23:52.682 --> 00:23:56.482
No where so many saints were born,

00:23:57.514 --> 00:24:00.433
even though there is speciality in this Land,

00:24:01.279 --> 00:24:04.140
if still Sahaja Yoga doesn't prosper here,

00:24:04.749 --> 00:24:07.577
then there is no hope of happening elsewhere.

00:24:07.956 --> 00:24:11.068
In Maharashtra, there are many misdemeanours

00:24:11.747 --> 00:24:13.978
which has affected people here.

00:24:15.615 --> 00:24:17.546
All this should be destroyed,

00:24:19.134 --> 00:24:21.617
I mean, all types of tobacco and so on.

00:24:21.996 --> 00:24:26.009
Today all of you should decide that if a person takes tobacco

00:24:26.397 --> 00:24:29.271
then he should not be invited for food at home.

00:24:29.628 --> 00:24:31.299
Abandon him.

00:24:33.770 --> 00:24:35.616
Tobacco is rampant in our country,

00:24:35.817 --> 00:24:38.666
but there is a lot of use of tobacco in Maharashtra.

00:24:39.065 --> 00:24:41.861
So if he is an addict, don't call him,

00:24:42.435 --> 00:24:44.776
tell him that Shri Krishna has told us.

00:24:45.094 --> 00:24:49.816
that if you are using tobacco, you don't sit in our company.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:56.760
There are many misdemeanours in Maharashtra.

00:24:59.223 --> 00:25:01.040
in which this is worse.

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:05.865
If you get rid of it, the language will be sweeter.

00:25:06.743 --> 00:25:10.614
It's a small thing, but the lesson learnt will be very beautiful.

00:25:13.639 --> 00:25:15.180
The rest I will  remove.

00:25:15.529 --> 00:25:17.418
just take care of the tobacco issue.

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:21.124
Everyone should share the work.

00:25:22.518 --> 00:25:27.354
There are also people who see it as a lot of work,

00:25:28.021 --> 00:25:35.105
One gift after another is flying.

00:25:37.372 --> 00:25:39.398
and there are people who have come,

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:43.416
from the places where usage of tobacco has increased.

00:25:44.363 --> 00:25:50.831
So, please I request all of you, to take my name without any fear.

00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:53.246
But do not go after tobacco.

00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:56.906
As the type of tobacco is going to be very terrible now.

00:25:57.206 --> 00:25:59.713
I am telling you, I have already said this.

00:26:00.022 --> 00:26:03.487
Then don't tell me, Mataji, you didn't warn us.

00:26:03.921 --> 00:26:06.581
Tobacco is of very dangerous variety,

00:26:06.782 --> 00:26:09.410
people have been taking tobacco for many years.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:10.891
But people should think about,

00:26:11.092 --> 00:26:14.124
why now, due to tobacco people are suffering more.

00:26:14.395 --> 00:26:19.356
There must be some reason why tobacco is taboo now to Almighty,

00:26:19.563 --> 00:26:22.842
so, you should understand and give up tobacco completely.

00:26:23.073 --> 00:26:25.295
This is a request on my Birthday,

00:26:25.517 --> 00:26:28.311
to the entire Maharashtrian community.

00:26:34.886 --> 00:26:37.703
The glory of Maharashtra is too big,

00:26:38.422 --> 00:26:41.033
This country got the name Maharashtra,

00:26:41.874 --> 00:26:43.152
that too,

00:26:44.688 --> 00:26:46.479
from time immemorial, no one can tell,

00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:48.680
why Maharashtra and from when?

00:26:50.997 --> 00:26:53.094
When Sanskrit was first seen, like,

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:57.253
a simple response,

00:26:58.047 --> 00:26:59.137
At that time,

00:26:59.846 --> 00:27:02.820
Maharashtrian language and culture became very popular

00:27:03.019 --> 00:27:05.066
There are five languages in this country.

00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:08.026
There are five languages in this country,

00:27:08.232 --> 00:27:09.389
hence it became Maharashtra,

00:27:09.590 --> 00:27:11.518
So Maharashtra is eternal.

00:27:12.832 --> 00:27:15.907
Before Shri Rama, this country was still Maharashtra.

00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:21.088
I mean how eternal this country is.

00:27:21.570 --> 00:27:27.020
And a lot of area of Dandakaranya come in Maharashtra, not entirely.

00:27:28.523 --> 00:27:32.782
some parts of it come from dandkaranya and some do not.

00:27:33.624 --> 00:27:35.886
Some parts are in Maharashtra

00:27:36.677 --> 00:27:39.185
Hence this was all pre-planned by God Almighty,

00:27:39.386 --> 00:27:41.407
such a special land was prepared.

00:27:42.644 --> 00:27:46.168
The meaning of it is so huge, that we will come to know gradually.

00:27:46.753 --> 00:27:48.437
If anything seems uncommunicative now,

00:27:48.638 --> 00:27:51.757
then in Sahaj Yoga everything comes out gradually.

00:27:52.114 --> 00:27:55.599
So, realise that, we are sitting in a very big land of virtue.

00:27:56.625 --> 00:28:00.518
Now for example, we enquired about a land

00:28:00.648 --> 00:28:02.848
I said, you should buy this land,

00:28:03.177 --> 00:28:05.029
but at that time people did not understand,

00:28:05.230 --> 00:28:07.904
that why Mataji is after this land.

00:28:08.202 --> 00:28:13.641
People’s thinking is such that, why Mataji is after this land.

00:28:14.313 --> 00:28:16.931
But they do not think that there is something,

00:28:17.176 --> 00:28:20.509
Now, a big article has appeared in the newspaper about that land,

00:28:20.712 --> 00:28:25.878
and all the sacred work has been done there since Tretayuga

00:28:26.099 --> 00:28:28.250
and how important the land is, and,

00:28:28.654 --> 00:28:34.373
Prahlad wandered there and that is the place of Shandilya Muni etc.

00:28:34.851 --> 00:28:39.599
When it was published, the people of Maharashtra realized that

00:28:40.266 --> 00:28:43.544
what Mataji has said was very special

00:28:44.214 --> 00:28:48.499
and that she did not ask for it unless it had some meaning.

00:28:50.439 --> 00:28:52.246
So in such a situation,

00:28:53.711 --> 00:28:55.306
one should understand that

00:28:55.876 --> 00:29:02.722
if we learn about some thing through vibrations, it is deep,

00:29:03.803 --> 00:29:06.509
And if I understand, it is very deep.

00:29:07.691 --> 00:29:12.893
And so I don't over-describe the depth of this Maharashtra,

00:29:13.497 --> 00:29:16.804
but I only say that this is a very beautiful place.

00:29:17.892 --> 00:29:22.217
So, to protect her, and to protect her sanctity,

00:29:22.717 --> 00:29:24.796
In this Maharashtra,

00:29:25.981 --> 00:29:29.060
the real roots of Sahaja Yoga will be found.

00:29:29.707 --> 00:29:33.706
So, the minds of the people of Maharashtra should be fully awakened.

00:29:34.262 --> 00:29:38.289
In whatever way we can, We should do this.

00:29:38.687 --> 00:29:41.377
In Maharashtra if you spread Sahaja Yoag,

00:29:41.647 --> 00:29:45.051
I have no doubt that it will spread all over the world.

00:29:45.393 --> 00:29:48.295
Because the saviour of entire world i.e. Shri Ashtavinayaks

00:29:48.639 --> 00:29:50.469
are rooted in Maharashtra,

00:29:50.804 --> 00:29:53.081
also Ramdas Swami has hoisted,

00:29:55.027 --> 00:29:56.963
many Shri Hanuman’s

00:29:58.288 --> 00:29:59.408
in this state.

00:30:00.194 --> 00:30:02.138
Many tasks have been done here,

00:30:02.553 --> 00:30:05.317
and due to its essence, this land has turned sacred,

00:30:05.518 --> 00:30:08.706
people of Maharashtra should know it's merits.

00:30:10.176 --> 00:30:13.590
In Maharashtrian language there is a special edge,

00:30:14.164 --> 00:30:17.767
and by holding morality and purity,

00:30:18.388 --> 00:30:20.792
it can be hoisted like a sword.

00:30:21.334 --> 00:30:22.073
But even then,

00:30:22.274 --> 00:30:25.987
the idea that you don't want to learn another language is wrong.

00:30:26.501 --> 00:30:28.677
If we do not respect other languages,

00:30:29.090 --> 00:30:32.290
we cannot spread Sahajayoga in those languages.

00:30:32.824 --> 00:30:35.935
So, all the Maharashtrian’s today should decide,

00:30:36.138 --> 00:30:40.296
that we should learn other languages, and respect others.

00:30:40.741 --> 00:30:43.470
And for them in our Maharashtra

00:30:43.844 --> 00:30:49.975
we should with great heart invite others wholeheartedly accept them.

00:30:54.530 --> 00:30:55.762
On me,

00:30:58.564 --> 00:31:00.420
you people have lot of faith,

00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:05.833
which is very deep,

00:31:06.318 --> 00:31:07.748
and why is it so deep?

00:31:07.891 --> 00:31:10.375
neither you nor I can say why?

00:31:11.045 --> 00:31:13.819
But nothing like this happens without any reason.

00:31:14.404 --> 00:31:18.136
Unless there is old or new relationship, such things don’t happen.

00:31:18.664 --> 00:31:22.791
Keeping that in mind, why are we going deeper,

00:31:23.372 --> 00:31:25.412
what is it that we did?

00:31:26.694 --> 00:31:30.360
Instead of thinking that, we might have done something,

00:31:31.897 --> 00:31:36.120
with such complete thought, in mind one must have

00:31:37.761 --> 00:31:39.074
self esteem..

00:31:40.903 --> 00:31:42.305
A kind of

00:31:44.134 --> 00:31:49.848
complete confidence one should invoke within oneself.

00:31:52.974 --> 00:31:56.242
We must be something, that’s why Mother has blessed us.

00:31:56.639 --> 00:31:58.595
Keeping this in mind, if you move ahead,

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:00.862
then rest of queries will be gone.

00:32:01.294 --> 00:32:04.892
Then we are something, so Mataji blessed us, and we have attained.

00:32:05.093 --> 00:32:07.150
We have got, what was our's.

00:32:08.384 --> 00:32:11.372
And what we have received we should spread.

00:32:11.822 --> 00:32:13.341
We are something that’s why we received;

00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:16.922
hence we should spread it, because we are something.

00:32:17.373 --> 00:32:18.032
We are something,

00:32:18.233 --> 00:32:21.887
so you can’t be polite, since we are something, we have to share.

00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.127
That’s what you people are,

00:32:25.022 --> 00:32:29.228
so joyful and beautiful, let others tell you,

00:32:29.694 --> 00:32:32.885
somebody else will tell, others will tell about us.

00:32:33.679 --> 00:32:37.455
When it will come to your observation, you will be surprised.

00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840
Let

00:32:41.306 --> 00:32:46.637
this day improve you all, be joyful, and be like festival.

00:32:47.014 --> 00:32:51.214
Whatever I can do for you I have already decided it.

00:32:52.079 --> 00:32:54.723
Now, whatever you want to do, go ahead with it.

00:32:54.926 --> 00:32:58.215
I don't want to say anything. Perform the Puja as you wish.

00:32:58.445 --> 00:33:00.421
No need to take permission for anything.

00:33:00.580 --> 00:33:05.333
You do what you think is right, I am ready for everything.
