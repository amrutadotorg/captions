05:36.440 --> 05:38.833
Shall I talk in Hindi? I will speak in English,

05:39.159 --> 05:41.944
Many people have come from different places. (Marathi)

05:54.459 --> 05:56.530
All are ready for puja.

05:57.808 --> 06:00.630
sit, sit, sit, you should sit. (Marathi)

06:14.476 --> 06:16.901
Many people have always asked me,

06:18.862 --> 06:21.560
that why God created this Universe.

06:23.620 --> 06:28.168
Of course, we are not supposed to ask questions to God.

06:29.547 --> 06:34.707
It’s easy to ask questions to Mataji when She is giving a lecture.

06:35.562 --> 06:39.151
But God, is a person who is beyond questions.

06:40.212 --> 06:42.338
And why He created Universe,

06:42.757 --> 06:46.043
is something like, why I wore all these ornaments.

06:46.900 --> 06:49.922
As I am not habituated of wearing ornaments,

06:52.131 --> 06:54.161
but I have to do it.

06:58.593 --> 07:01.319
I have to do it just to please you people,

07:02.591 --> 07:05.713
or we can say that God created this earth,

07:06.233 --> 07:08.354
just to please His own children,

07:09.614 --> 07:11.154
just to make them happy,

07:12.035 --> 07:15.435
just to make them enter into the Kingdom of God,

07:16.139 --> 07:18.397
to give all that what He has got.

07:19.472 --> 07:20.901
So He had to create,

07:21.738 --> 07:23.700
this creation in such a way,

07:24.922 --> 07:25.994
that,

07:27.428 --> 07:28.481
He could

07:29.990 --> 07:31.742
create His own image,

07:33.870 --> 07:34.959
reflect it,

07:36.243 --> 07:39.223
and make it, enjoy itself.

07:44.837 --> 07:46.690
It’s a very mutual

07:47.823 --> 07:49.032
appreciation,

07:51.385 --> 07:54.740
as we call it, andolan.

07:58.827 --> 08:03.098
Whatever He does for us, is for His own pleasures.

08:05.566 --> 08:10.941
But the beauty of it is that your pleasure is His pleasure.

08:12.594 --> 08:14.671
And the other way round is, His pleasure,

08:14.931 --> 08:17.527
should be your pleasure, too.

08:19.022 --> 08:20.392
Once that becomes

08:21.840 --> 08:26.543
the fact, that the pleasure of God becomes your pleasure,

08:28.681 --> 08:33.728
you enter into that beautiful arena of

08:34.941 --> 08:37.824
heavenly joy, "swargiya anand".

08:41.023 --> 08:43.782
Only if it is one sided

08:45.553 --> 08:48.553
enterprise or one-sided effort,

08:50.427 --> 08:51.655
it gets lost.

08:52.668 --> 08:54.540
Human efforts are one-sided.

08:56.082 --> 08:59.288
But God’s efforts are such that they cannot,

08:59.708 --> 09:02.718
be enjoyed unless and until they are reflected by.

09:03.755 --> 09:05.717
So whatever He has given us,

09:06.812 --> 09:08.574
we cannot count them,

09:10.316 --> 09:12.214
we can only say they are blessings.

09:12.953 --> 09:15.286
because it’s an abstract way of saying things,

09:15.510 --> 09:17.675
That is the blessing of God,

09:20.220 --> 09:22.522
that He has given all the blessings.

09:24.014 --> 09:26.732
It’s an abstract thing, because we cannot count,

09:27.282 --> 09:28.908
we cannot give it a form,

09:29.328 --> 09:31.853
we cannot say, what He has done for us.

09:35.609 --> 09:40.529
And when this joy of His creation is felt in our heart,

09:41.633 --> 09:44.780
once we start enjoying that joy within ourselves,

09:45.822 --> 09:49.410
then it becomes a complete picture.

09:52.658 --> 09:55.392
When it is complete, you cannot describe it,

09:56.494 --> 09:58.196
because it is not relative.

09:59.695 --> 10:01.216
You can just enjoy it.

10:02.645 --> 10:08.438
And that is how the depth of enjoyment is described,

10:08.993 --> 10:11.611
that at that depth, what are we to say?

10:12.616 --> 10:13.691
We are lost.

10:14.829 --> 10:19.096
The drop has become the ocean and the ocean has become the drop.

10:20.802 --> 10:23.068
First the ocean becomes the drop,

10:23.867 --> 10:25.936
and then drop becomes the ocean.

10:26.473 --> 10:29.407
And then the ocean tries to become the drop.

10:31.817 --> 10:35.335
It’s a beautiful system of give and take,

10:36.994 --> 10:39.483
which can only be appreciated by people

10:40.847 --> 10:44.197
who have tasted the nectar,

10:44.954 --> 10:46.962
of the beauty of God’s love.

10:47.373 --> 10:49.398
It’s very easy to say there is no God.

10:49.819 --> 10:51.732
It’s the easiest thing to say.

10:53.861 --> 10:57.543
But it is even easier to enjoy God than that.

10:59.271 --> 11:03.374
Is the easiest thing to enjoy Him because He is so available.

11:04.073 --> 11:05.215
He is so anxious.

11:05.573 --> 11:08.350
The whole purpose of creation is to give you joy,

11:08.906 --> 11:10.721
to give you happiness.

11:12.049 --> 11:14.834
As today, when I had to go to the bank,

11:16.343 --> 11:19.977
I was wondering, “I have never worn these ornaments anytime in life,

11:20.284 --> 11:23.220
and today as the time has come and I have to wear.

11:23.468 --> 11:24.816
I just thought of it.

11:25.812 --> 11:29.383
“It’s just for my children”, If I have to wear them,

11:30.049 --> 11:31.369
what does it matter?

11:33.641 --> 11:37.115
Just to make them happy, what does it matter?

11:38.090 --> 11:41.299
If they feel happy, then My happiness is complete.

11:42.614 --> 11:45.638
But you felt for Me, that I should wear,

11:45.947 --> 11:51.105
itself shows that you wanted to see them on Me.

11:51.833 --> 11:55.063
Is also suggestive of your very subtle bhakti,

11:55.657 --> 11:57.771
very subtle love for your Mother.

11:58.250 --> 12:00.876
In these modern times,

12:01.493 --> 12:04.606
to have such bhaktas, itself is a big blessing for Me.

12:05.432 --> 12:08.950
So as you say, “Mother, bless us,” I say, “You also bless Me.

12:09.550 --> 12:10.631
You have already blessed me

12:10.832 --> 12:13.963
by this beautiful arrangement that you have made,

12:15.419 --> 12:17.676
the way you have put yourself,

12:18.752 --> 12:22.138
surrendered yourself for this great puja.

12:23.786 --> 12:30.042
Because all is such an interdependent

12:32.279 --> 12:33.373
process.

12:34.274 --> 12:39.350
You do the puja, I can’t do the puja, You have to do the puja.

12:40.094 --> 12:43.118
When you do the puja, the chakras are awakened.

12:45.558 --> 12:48.948
Mine are awakened, but in you they are awakened.

12:50.142 --> 12:54.311
Now how to explain to people what is the importance of puja is.

12:55.900 --> 12:57.494
If you have not tasted,

12:59.948 --> 13:03.483
the fruit of a puja it is impossible to explain.

13:06.525 --> 13:10.850
It is at a higher level only one can understand all these things.

13:11.835 --> 13:15.889
But, so far whatever was done was at such a lower level

13:16.257 --> 13:21.158
by such low type of people that everything became,

13:21.619 --> 13:24.524
absolutely unholy.

13:25.875 --> 13:27.461
It was all unholy doing

13:28.009 --> 13:34.018
and because of that unholy doing God himself is unhappy.

13:37.769 --> 13:40.503
So, He has created this Universe,

13:41.425 --> 13:45.100
to create realized souls, not to create useless people,

13:45.585 --> 13:49.195
not to create people, who do not believe in God,

13:49.579 --> 13:53.184
who do not believe in higher life,

13:53.883 --> 13:59.438
who do not believe in leading a life of purity.

14:01.771 --> 14:04.185
He never created this Universe for them.

14:04.560 --> 14:08.288
They are just existing, just like dead people.

14:08.701 --> 14:10.501
They are not living people.

14:11.524 --> 14:18.064
So those who believe in God, those who worship Him, with all purity,

14:18.815 --> 14:22.720
are actually, in a way, giving blessings to God

14:22.934 --> 14:25.172
because it is so pleasurable for Him to see,

14:25.521 --> 14:27.071
that they have understood,

14:27.516 --> 14:31.293
that they have felt it, that they have liked it.

14:33.408 --> 14:36.289
Sahaj Yogis also, some of them have problems,

14:37.326 --> 14:38.289
doesn’t matter.

14:38.690 --> 14:43.150
But as long as the desire is pure, your Kundalini is pure,

14:44.293 --> 14:47.028
as long as you feel you that you have to do,

14:47.719 --> 14:49.933
your ascent in a proper way,

14:51.814 --> 14:53.321
in a surrendered way,

14:53.956 --> 14:59.489
everything is going to become a complete beautiful picture.

15:00.730 --> 15:04.182
And to create this elevated,

15:07.222 --> 15:13.152
Kingdom of God, within our heart and without,

15:14.197 --> 15:17.145
one has to know that

15:18.253 --> 15:21.482
God’s efforts are absolutely,

15:23.840 --> 15:24.982
complete.

15:25.817 --> 15:27.083
He has made you.

15:29.205 --> 15:35.789
Now only little less is there, It’s from the other side.

15:36.543 --> 15:39.416
He has created this universe so beautifully,

15:40.737 --> 15:43.507
and after creating that beautiful universe,

15:44.665 --> 15:49.942
that universe has to reflect God fully. That’s all.

15:52.069 --> 15:54.408
So the fifty percent job is done.

15:55.331 --> 15:57.798
Only other fifty percent job you have to do.

15:58.085 --> 16:00.308
You should not worry if there are people,

16:00.562 --> 16:02.467
who are not interested in Sahaj Yog,

16:02.626 --> 16:04.678
those who are not going to do meditation,

16:04.829 --> 16:06.749
those who are not going to do puja,

16:06.952 --> 16:09.813
those who do not enjoy this higher life.

16:10.210 --> 16:11.829
Just don’t worry about them.

16:12.369 --> 16:15.011
But you must know that you are special people,

16:15.734 --> 16:19.392
and that you have to create the nucleus,

16:20.321 --> 16:23.638
the complete body of that part,

16:25.329 --> 16:29.844
which is going to complete this work of great faith.

16:31.998 --> 16:35.526
Today I am so enamoured

16:37.115 --> 16:41.400
that the speed of everything has come down to zero for Me now.

16:43.314 --> 16:46.758
Nothing is moving, there is no gati in Me now left,

16:48.359 --> 16:53.401
So enamoured and overwhelmed by your celebration,

16:54.176 --> 16:55.541
by your kindness,

16:57.685 --> 17:00.882
that I just don’t know how to express Myself.

17:04.507 --> 17:06.927
All this is suggestive,

17:07.690 --> 17:12.763
of tremendous depth and gratitude in your hearts,

17:13.819 --> 17:16.763
for something I have done nothing whatsoever.

17:18.702 --> 17:21.263
I have done nothing, because I have not achieved anything

17:21.464 --> 17:25.084
in life Myself, I was what I am, I will be the same.

17:26.283 --> 17:29.109
I have not done any tapasya or anything.

17:30.690 --> 17:37.109
I have not walked even an inch to achieve my goal.

17:39.130 --> 17:41.701
It’s you who have prepared yourself,

17:42.709 --> 17:45.114
who have come closer and closer,

17:46.090 --> 17:48.718
just like a ready

17:51.250 --> 17:56.781
lamp, a Deepak, and got yourself ignited,

17:57.355 --> 18:00.496
enlightened yourself, because of your preparation.

18:01.504 --> 18:03.980
It’s only your own doing,

18:04.750 --> 18:09.985
which has given this light everywhere.

18:11.405 --> 18:15.379
You know very well that light cannot spread in vacuum.

18:15.769 --> 18:16.863
It cannot spread.

18:17.983 --> 18:20.387
If there is vacuum, light cannot spread.

18:21.343 --> 18:27.295
That’s why without the Sahaj Yogis, I have no existence at all.

18:27.875 --> 18:29.112
I don’t exist.

18:29.654 --> 18:32.582
My whole existence is here because of you.

18:33.273 --> 18:35.415
I have no meaning, I have no work.

18:35.797 --> 18:39.345
I don’t do any work at all, I am the one who is the laziest

18:40.210 --> 18:42.567
and who doesn’t do any work whatsoever.

18:42.796 --> 18:46.859
It’s only you who have achieved it.

18:47.262 --> 18:49.343
It is you who have raised yourself.

18:49.860 --> 18:53.440
Actually, your birthdays must be celebrated, instead of Mine,

18:53.913 --> 18:57.773
because neither I am getting old nor young, I am just the same.

18:58.407 --> 19:00.827
There is no difference in anyway.

19:01.315 --> 19:03.326
And I think it should be,

19:03.527 --> 19:07.019
the birthday of Sahaj Yoga which should be celebrated today.

19:07.496 --> 19:09.212
That we can say today,

19:10.022 --> 19:13.706
that it is about twelve years ten months,

19:14.584 --> 19:18.037
that Sahaj Yoga was started on a public basis,

19:18.321 --> 19:23.418
though I started it long time back I don’t know how many years back.

19:25.880 --> 19:31.001
So, at this stage, we have to understand that

19:31.644 --> 19:33.717
puja is an abstract,

19:34.845 --> 19:38.241
achievement which can only be experienced,

19:38.662 --> 19:42.453
and all of you should sit with that feeling,

19:42.779 --> 19:45.159
that we are going to achieve,

19:48.985 --> 19:50.627
nothingness within us.

19:53.422 --> 19:55.638
egoless, egolessness,

19:56.985 --> 19:59.585
emptiness, cleansing,

20:00.649 --> 20:06.133
so that the light of love should flood all the areas within us.

20:09.768 --> 20:11.791
And that is only possible,

20:12.895 --> 20:16.228
when, of course, the chakras are to be awakened.

20:17.422 --> 20:20.851
That’s going to work out and also that,

20:21.874 --> 20:24.662
you should open out your hearts completely.

20:25.102 --> 20:26.717
Not to doubt anything,

20:27.553 --> 20:30.583
not to think about anything, but just open your hearts.

20:31.676 --> 20:35.778
just receive it, with complete faith and understanding.

20:42.515 --> 20:45.188
You have people from all over the countries,

20:46.220 --> 20:49.800
so many countries, all the world is represented here.

20:51.821 --> 20:53.007
I feel,

20:54.947 --> 20:58.736
that already we have touched every corner of the world.

21:01.048 --> 21:02.440
On this day,

21:02.948 --> 21:05.040
only thing we have to declare that,

21:05.286 --> 21:08.984
let Sahaja Yoga become a Mahayoga, in its full way.

21:09.282 --> 21:12.480
That everybody in the whole world should recognize

21:13.036 --> 21:16.115
that Sahaj Yoga is the only way people can,

21:17.092 --> 21:20.698
rise in their evolution, and a new world can be created.

21:24.143 --> 21:28.107
please sit down for two minutes, did you hear? sit down (Marathi)

21:33.214 --> 21:35.185
And this kind of a

21:36.889 --> 21:37.991
development,

21:39.731 --> 21:41.954
which is a collective development,

21:42.953 --> 21:46.757
which is not of outer world but of the inner world,

21:48.151 --> 21:50.026
which generate the roots,

21:53.334 --> 21:58.751
of this creation into a new dimension,

22:00.037 --> 22:02.553
into a new personality,

22:05.338 --> 22:06.338
because,

22:07.730 --> 22:11.609
by that time, the roots would have reached the source,

22:12.225 --> 22:14.351
source of this Divine love,

22:15.146 --> 22:19.570
of this All-pervading Power of this Brahmashakti.

22:21.699 --> 22:26.640
Today I would request you, that you all should take a vow,

22:27.092 --> 22:30.645
that all of you will try to bring more people to Sahaj Yoga

22:31.002 --> 22:35.399
and try to save as many as possible, through all your efforts.

22:36.226 --> 22:39.977
That’s the only thing, if you can give me on My birthday,

22:40.200 --> 22:42.160
I’ll be very much thankful.

22:45.684 --> 22:47.580
May God bless you all.

22:53.954 --> 22:57.548
In Maharashtra, you can't live without speaking Marathi.

22:58.009 --> 23:00.255
You should speak a little Marathi,

23:01.788 --> 23:04.185
And the fact that we have survived for seven years,

23:04.511 --> 23:07.139
means, we've managed somehow.

23:10.473 --> 23:13.750
AAAA, the speciality of Marathas,

23:16.357 --> 23:18.443
Saints who were born in this land,

23:18.768 --> 23:22.054
have poured water on their foreheads.

23:23.935 --> 23:25.611
saints have preached a lot,

23:26.263 --> 23:30.564
and Gods have erected 3 and a half peethas here.

23:33.117 --> 23:35.219
Ashtavinayaks are residing here,

23:35.502 --> 23:36.969
by receiving all this,

23:37.400 --> 23:41.067
if people of Maharashtra do not achieve divinity,

23:41.432 --> 23:45.021
then people of Maharashtra will be answerable to everyone.

23:45.857 --> 23:50.087
one should keep in mind, lot of effort has been done in Maharashtra.

23:52.682 --> 23:56.482
No where so many saints were born,

23:57.514 --> 24:00.433
even though there is speciality in this Land,

24:01.279 --> 24:04.140
if still Sahaja Yoga doesn't prosper here,

24:04.749 --> 24:07.577
then there is no hope of happening elsewhere.

24:07.956 --> 24:11.068
In Maharashtra, there are many misdemeanours

24:11.747 --> 24:13.978
which has affected people here.

24:15.615 --> 24:17.546
All this should be destroyed,

24:19.134 --> 24:21.617
I mean, all types of tobacco and so on.

24:21.996 --> 24:26.009
Today all of you should decide that if a person takes tobacco

24:26.397 --> 24:29.271
then he should not be invited for food at home.

24:29.628 --> 24:31.299
Abandon him.

24:33.770 --> 24:35.616
Tobacco is rampant in our country,

24:35.817 --> 24:38.666
but there is a lot of use of tobacco in Maharashtra.

24:39.065 --> 24:41.861
So if he is an addict, don't call him,

24:42.435 --> 24:44.776
tell him that Shri Krishna has told us.

24:45.094 --> 24:49.816
that if you are using tobacco, you don't sit in our company.

24:53.880 --> 24:56.760
There are many misdemeanours in Maharashtra.

24:59.223 --> 25:01.040
in which this is worse.

25:01.770 --> 25:05.865
If you get rid of it, the language will be sweeter.

25:06.743 --> 25:10.614
It's a small thing, but the lesson learnt will be very beautiful.

25:13.639 --> 25:15.180
The rest I will  remove.

25:15.529 --> 25:17.418
just take care of the tobacco issue.

25:17.990 --> 25:21.124
Everyone should share the work.

25:22.518 --> 25:27.354
There are also people who see it as a lot of work,

25:28.021 --> 25:35.105
One gift after another is flying.

25:37.372 --> 25:39.398
and there are people who have come,

25:39.680 --> 25:43.416
from the places where usage of tobacco has increased.

25:44.363 --> 25:50.831
So, please I request all of you, to take my name without any fear.

25:51.440 --> 25:53.246
But do not go after tobacco.

25:53.820 --> 25:56.906
As the type of tobacco is going to be very terrible now.

25:57.206 --> 25:59.713
I am telling you, I have already said this.

26:00.022 --> 26:03.487
Then don't tell me, Mataji, you didn't warn us.

26:03.921 --> 26:06.581
Tobacco is of very dangerous variety,

26:06.782 --> 26:09.410
people have been taking tobacco for many years.

26:09.630 --> 26:10.891
But people should think about,

26:11.092 --> 26:14.124
why now, due to tobacco people are suffering more.

26:14.395 --> 26:19.356
There must be some reason why tobacco is taboo now to Almighty,

26:19.563 --> 26:22.842
so, you should understand and give up tobacco completely.

26:23.073 --> 26:25.295
This is a request on my Birthday,

26:25.517 --> 26:28.311
to the entire Maharashtrian community.

26:34.886 --> 26:37.703
The glory of Maharashtra is too big,

26:38.422 --> 26:41.033
This country got the name Maharashtra,

26:41.874 --> 26:43.152
that too,

26:44.688 --> 26:46.479
from time immemorial, no one can tell,

26:46.680 --> 26:48.680
why Maharashtra and from when?

26:50.997 --> 26:53.094
When Sanskrit was first seen, like,

26:53.870 --> 26:57.253
a simple response,

26:58.047 --> 26:59.137
At that time,

26:59.846 --> 27:02.820
Maharashtrian language and culture became very popular

27:03.019 --> 27:05.066
There are five languages in this country.

27:05.249 --> 27:08.026
There are five languages in this country,

27:08.232 --> 27:09.389
hence it became Maharashtra,

27:09.590 --> 27:11.518
So Maharashtra is eternal.

27:12.832 --> 27:15.907
Before Shri Rama, this country was still Maharashtra.

27:17.910 --> 27:21.088
I mean how eternal this country is.

27:21.570 --> 27:27.020
And a lot of area of Dandakaranya come in Maharashtra, not entirely.

27:28.523 --> 27:32.782
some parts of it come from dandkaranya and some do not.

27:33.624 --> 27:35.886
Some parts are in Maharashtra

27:36.677 --> 27:39.185
Hence this was all pre-planned by God Almighty,

27:39.386 --> 27:41.407
such a special land was prepared.

27:42.644 --> 27:46.168
The meaning of it is so huge, that we will come to know gradually.

27:46.753 --> 27:48.437
If anything seems uncommunicative now,

27:48.638 --> 27:51.757
then in Sahaj Yoga everything comes out gradually.

27:52.114 --> 27:55.599
So, realise that, we are sitting in a very big land of virtue.

27:56.625 --> 28:00.518
Now for example, we enquired about a land

28:00.648 --> 28:02.848
I said, you should buy this land,

28:03.177 --> 28:05.029
but at that time people did not understand,

28:05.230 --> 28:07.904
that why Mataji is after this land.

28:08.202 --> 28:13.641
People’s thinking is such that, why Mataji is after this land.

28:14.313 --> 28:16.931
But they do not think that there is something,

28:17.176 --> 28:20.509
Now, a big article has appeared in the newspaper about that land,

28:20.712 --> 28:25.878
and all the sacred work has been done there since Tretayuga

28:26.099 --> 28:28.250
and how important the land is, and,

28:28.654 --> 28:34.373
Prahlad wandered there and that is the place of Shandilya Muni etc.

28:34.851 --> 28:39.599
When it was published, the people of Maharashtra realized that

28:40.266 --> 28:43.544
what Mataji has said was very special

28:44.214 --> 28:48.499
and that she did not ask for it unless it had some meaning.

28:50.439 --> 28:52.246
So in such a situation,

28:53.711 --> 28:55.306
one should understand that

28:55.876 --> 29:02.722
if we learn about some thing through vibrations, it is deep,

29:03.803 --> 29:06.509
And if I understand, it is very deep.

29:07.691 --> 29:12.893
And so I don't over-describe the depth of this Maharashtra,

29:13.497 --> 29:16.804
but I only say that this is a very beautiful place.

29:17.892 --> 29:22.217
So, to protect her, and to protect her sanctity,

29:22.717 --> 29:24.796
In this Maharashtra,

29:25.981 --> 29:29.060
the real roots of Sahaja Yoga will be found.

29:29.707 --> 29:33.706
So, the minds of the people of Maharashtra should be fully awakened.

29:34.262 --> 29:38.289
In whatever way we can, We should do this.

29:38.687 --> 29:41.377
In Maharashtra if you spread Sahaja Yoag,

29:41.647 --> 29:45.051
I have no doubt that it will spread all over the world.

29:45.393 --> 29:48.295
Because the saviour of entire world i.e. Shri Ashtavinayaks

29:48.639 --> 29:50.469
are rooted in Maharashtra,

29:50.804 --> 29:53.081
also Ramdas Swami has hoisted,

29:55.027 --> 29:56.963
many Shri Hanuman’s

29:58.288 --> 29:59.408
in this state.

30:00.194 --> 30:02.138
Many tasks have been done here,

30:02.553 --> 30:05.317
and due to its essence, this land has turned sacred,

30:05.518 --> 30:08.706
people of Maharashtra should know it's merits.

30:10.176 --> 30:13.590
In Maharashtrian language there is a special edge,

30:14.164 --> 30:17.767
and by holding morality and purity,

30:18.388 --> 30:20.792
it can be hoisted like a sword.

30:21.334 --> 30:22.073
But even then,

30:22.274 --> 30:25.987
the idea that you don't want to learn another language is wrong.

30:26.501 --> 30:28.677
If we do not respect other languages,

30:29.090 --> 30:32.290
we cannot spread Sahajayoga in those languages.

30:32.824 --> 30:35.935
So, all the Maharashtrian’s today should decide,

30:36.138 --> 30:40.296
that we should learn other languages, and respect others.

30:40.741 --> 30:43.470
And for them in our Maharashtra

30:43.844 --> 30:49.975
we should with great heart invite others wholeheartedly accept them.

30:54.530 --> 30:55.762
On me,

30:58.564 --> 31:00.420
you people have lot of faith,

31:02.800 --> 31:05.833
which is very deep,

31:06.318 --> 31:07.748
and why is it so deep?

31:07.891 --> 31:10.375
neither you nor I can say why?

31:11.045 --> 31:13.819
But nothing like this happens without any reason.

31:14.404 --> 31:18.136
Unless there is old or new relationship, such things don’t happen.

31:18.664 --> 31:22.791
Keeping that in mind, why are we going deeper,

31:23.372 --> 31:25.412
what is it that we did?

31:26.694 --> 31:30.360
Instead of thinking that, we might have done something,

31:31.897 --> 31:36.120
with such complete thought, in mind one must have

31:37.761 --> 31:39.074
self esteem..

31:40.903 --> 31:42.305
A kind of

31:44.134 --> 31:49.848
complete confidence one should invoke within oneself.

31:52.974 --> 31:56.242
We must be something, that’s why Mother has blessed us.

31:56.639 --> 31:58.595
Keeping this in mind, if you move ahead,

31:58.870 --> 32:00.862
then rest of queries will be gone.

32:01.294 --> 32:04.892
Then we are something, so Mataji blessed us, and we have attained.

32:05.093 --> 32:07.150
We have got, what was our's.

32:08.384 --> 32:11.372
And what we have received we should spread.

32:11.822 --> 32:13.341
We are something that’s why we received;

32:13.542 --> 32:16.922
hence we should spread it, because we are something.

32:17.373 --> 32:18.032
We are something,

32:18.233 --> 32:21.887
so you can’t be polite, since we are something, we have to share.

32:22.470 --> 32:24.127
That’s what you people are,

32:25.022 --> 32:29.228
so joyful and beautiful, let others tell you,

32:29.694 --> 32:32.885
somebody else will tell, others will tell about us.

32:33.679 --> 32:37.455
When it will come to your observation, you will be surprised.

32:38.840 --> 32:39.840
Let

32:41.306 --> 32:46.637
this day improve you all, be joyful, and be like festival.

32:47.014 --> 32:51.214
Whatever I can do for you I have already decided it.

32:52.079 --> 32:54.723
Now, whatever you want to do, go ahead with it.

32:54.926 --> 32:58.215
I don't want to say anything. Perform the Puja as you wish.

32:58.445 --> 33:00.421
No need to take permission for anything.

33:00.580 --> 33:05.333
You do what you think is right, I am ready for everything.
