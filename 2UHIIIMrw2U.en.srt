1
00:00:00,805 --> 00:00:05,518
So, I... People ask me,
“What are you going to talk about?”

2
00:00:05,719 --> 00:00:07,351
So I am saying,
“Let’s see.”

3
00:00:07,552 --> 00:00:10,518
As I had a few minutes,
I did one or two drawings.

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,471
I would like to talk to you
about planet Sahaj this morning

5
00:00:14,672 --> 00:00:20,732
and I would like to explain to you
this planet on which you live.

6
00:00:20,933 --> 00:00:23,411
And I want to explain a paradox

7
00:00:23,612 --> 00:00:28,411
because - the paradox is that -
we ARE AND WE ARE NOT

8
00:00:28,612 --> 00:00:30,753
AT THE SAME TIME.

9
00:00:31,503 --> 00:00:36,628
Because there is a discrepancy between
what we  say we are

10
00:00:36,956 --> 00:00:39,029
and we say we are yogis

11
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:41,888
and what sometimes we seem to be.

12
00:00:42,089 --> 00:00:47,995
So people can be a little bit confused
or depressed about it.

13
00:00:48,196 --> 00:00:50,279
I remember sometimes
people ask me,

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:53,706
”Since how long
have you been in sahaj?”

15
00:00:54,487 --> 00:00:57,906
People ask me, “Since how long time
are you doing sahaj?”

16
00:00:58,107 --> 00:00:59,578
It’s embarrassing,

17
00:00:59,779 --> 00:01:02,236
it’s almost like you ask
an old lady her age,

18
00:01:02,437 --> 00:01:07,273
because in August I will say
I am in Sahaj since 40 years.

19
00:01:11,854 --> 00:01:15,628
And then I have to look at myself
in the mirror and I say,

20
00:01:15,829 --> 00:01:19,151
“Now, what is this: a maha yogi
or a mini yogi?”

21
00:01:19,542 --> 00:01:21,427
Well, I have to explain.

22
00:01:21,628 --> 00:01:25,068
The explanation is very simple

23
00:01:25,269 --> 00:01:28,177
but Boris says to know
that with the translation...

24
00:01:28,378 --> 00:01:31,536
I am not saying whether it’s
one hour with or without translation.

25
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:35,591
See, Shri Mataji has explained to me
how Adi Kundalini

26
00:01:35,792 --> 00:01:38,846
was awakened in Nargol,

27
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:42,161
on the border of the Indian ocean.

28
00:01:42,362 --> 00:01:47,619
Shri Mataji has explained to me how
Adi Kundalini was awakened in Nargol

29
00:01:47,847 --> 00:01:50,740
And it looks a bit like a Krimi
(a spy novel in German)

30
00:01:50,941 --> 00:01:56,943
because She went there
to spy on a rakshasa

31
00:01:57,771 --> 00:02:01,401
who had there a seminar.

32
00:02:02,135 --> 00:02:04,396
Because there was a big Rajnish camp,

33
00:02:04,597 --> 00:02:08,245
and Shri Mataji went there to see
what was happening.

34
00:02:09,097 --> 00:02:13,878
Then, what She told me
is that She could see

35
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:19,003
with Her yogic powers how Rajnish
was possessing everybody.

36
00:02:19,347 --> 00:02:24,990
And then what She said
is that She realised

37
00:02:25,191 --> 00:02:30,987
that advent (of Evil) was much more
advanced than what She thought.

38
00:02:31,425 --> 00:02:35,228
Don’t ask me to explain what
Shri Mataji knows and doesn’t know

39
00:02:35,429 --> 00:02:37,904
because, you know,
we can’t understand,

40
00:02:38,105 --> 00:02:40,500
but basically, this was
what She was saying.

41
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:44,943
And She felt that if it
would not happen now,

42
00:02:45,144 --> 00:02:49,807
on mass realisation,
mankind would be destroyed.

43
00:02:50,167 --> 00:02:54,432
We are talking about
May 1970, so ... you can see.

44
00:02:54,633 --> 00:02:57,020
We take our time towards destruction.

45
00:02:57,221 --> 00:03:01,648
So, then comes
the important bit of the story:

46
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,992
Then She described how She was
sitting under this tree,

47
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:11,630
and then the Adi Kundalini, you know,
just rose, and She described it.

48
00:03:12,662 --> 00:03:19,609
But what She says is that
the Kundalini was released,

49
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:26,740
although mankind was not ready,
this is the important thing.

50
00:03:26,998 --> 00:03:30,763
And this explains
what is going on today.

51
00:03:31,162 --> 00:03:35,382
You see, when in the past
people would get their realisation,

52
00:03:35,583 --> 00:03:40,180
they would get their realisation
having cleaned the entire system:

53
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:43,180
all the chakras were clean,

54
00:03:43,381 --> 00:03:47,242
the attention was Nirmal,
the attention was purer,

55
00:03:47,443 --> 00:03:50,647
nobody could get (caught up),
no question being possessed,

56
00:03:50,848 --> 00:03:54,940
people had reached the level
where Kundalini would rise.

57
00:03:55,326 --> 00:04:00,111
What Shri Mataji did,
because She is the overlord,

58
00:04:00,312 --> 00:04:03,417
overlord of the entire system:

59
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:06,533
She rewrote the Divine books.

60
00:04:06,734 --> 00:04:09,966
She did something that no Deity,

61
00:04:10,167 --> 00:04:11,943
no avatar,

62
00:04:12,144 --> 00:04:16,526
no saint has or could
ever do before Her.

63
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:21,409
She gave realisation to people,
who were not prepared.

64
00:04:21,792 --> 00:04:27,932
And that also explained
the 10 last years of Her life,

65
00:04:28,151 --> 00:04:32,323
where She said
She would go into sanyasa.

66
00:04:32,524 --> 00:04:35,771
We think She would go to Pratishtan
and withdraw, but no,

67
00:04:35,972 --> 00:04:38,325
She went into a condition,

68
00:04:38,526 --> 00:04:44,029
in which She withdrew Her attention
apparently from Her physical form,

69
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:48,565
and that for 10 years,
and it was a tremendous tapasya!

70
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:54,075
And we understand
that She did this to (purify us)

71
00:04:54,276 --> 00:04:59,684
Because She says She took...
She took us all unprepared

72
00:04:59,885 --> 00:05:03,224
as we are sahaja yogis
in Her cosmic body.

73
00:05:03,425 --> 00:05:06,737
so She did that tapasya

74
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:12,930
to purify all the options of what
would happen, once She leaves.

75
00:05:13,305 --> 00:05:16,773
That basically now
it is up to us.

76
00:05:17,078 --> 00:05:19,878
You know, I told you,
how on the animal channel

77
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:24,362
we watch how the mumy bear is
throwing their kids into the wilderness,

78
00:05:24,563 --> 00:05:26,933
the little bears,
they want to stay with mummy,

79
00:05:27,134 --> 00:05:29,331
but they cannot do it,
because she keeps them away.

80
00:05:29,532 --> 00:05:32,177
Because that’s the only way
the little bears

81
00:05:32,378 --> 00:05:34,221
are going to become big bears

82
00:05:34,422 --> 00:05:36,474
and they can survive,
that's why she does it.

83
00:05:36,675 --> 00:05:44,463
And this 10 years when She withdrew,
let's say 2003 - 2013, more or less.

84
00:05:45,042 --> 00:05:49,596
But this also explains
why we are yogis

85
00:05:49,847 --> 00:05:52,560
and some of us
are still struggling,

86
00:05:52,761 --> 00:05:57,888
because the work, that we didn't do
before, the rising of the Kundalini,

87
00:05:58,089 --> 00:06:01,490
we need to do it after
the rising of the Kundalini.

88
00:06:01,691 --> 00:06:03,442
And if we understand that,

89
00:06:03,643 --> 00:06:07,174
we don't feel bad
about any difficulties.

90
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,568
So, now to understand
a bit about how this thing works,

91
00:06:13,769 --> 00:06:16,635
let’s go back to planet Sahaj.

92
00:06:18,472 --> 00:06:21,276
(German?)

93
00:06:53,434 --> 00:06:57,888
There are 2 forces
that we are dealing with:

94
00:06:59,021 --> 00:07:06,875
one is the centripetal force,
which takes you in,

95
00:07:07,422 --> 00:07:13,750
and one is the centrifugal force,
which takes you out.

96
00:07:14,381 --> 00:07:19,232
Now, in one tape Shri Mataji says,
- it's not so reassuring -

97
00:07:19,433 --> 00:07:23,612
but She says, this force is anxious
to throw you out.

98
00:07:24,073 --> 00:07:29,018
So that corresponds
to 2 types of religion:

99
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,507
one is the inner religion,

100
00:07:36,708 --> 00:07:41,724
which corresponds
to the centripetal movement,

101
00:07:41,925 --> 00:07:45,698
and the centrifugal religion
takes you out.

102
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:48,713
Ok?
The external religion.

103
00:07:49,433 --> 00:07:53,503
So Shri Mataji, She asked
in public and in private,

104
00:07:53,704 --> 00:07:57,956
She asked, “What will you do,
once that I will be gone:

105
00:07:58,157 --> 00:08:02,359
will you do the same thing
as you did to the other religions?”

106
00:08:02,614 --> 00:08:03,992
Ok, so

107
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:10,453
what is the inner religion?

108
00:08:11,422 --> 00:08:15,445
We’ll go back to that.
What is the external religion?

109
00:08:15,704 --> 00:08:19,055
The external religion is

110
00:08:21,086 --> 00:08:24,555
that you do not...

111
00:08:24,985 --> 00:08:29,289
Ok. The internal religion is
Sahaja sthiti

112
00:08:29,664 --> 00:08:34,401
- the state of Sahaj, it’s a state -
Sahaja sthiti.

113
00:08:34,602 --> 00:08:36,612
That’s the inner religion.

114
00:08:36,813 --> 00:08:41,518
And this is what you all know, when
you are in thoughtless awareness,

115
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:46,164
when you are in love when you are
in peace, when you are in Sahasrara.

116
00:08:46,594 --> 00:08:52,096
But because of this process
of purification in unprepared yogis

117
00:08:52,297 --> 00:08:56,499
was not completed,
we are not always in Sahaj sthiti,

118
00:08:56,700 --> 00:08:58,820
when we call ourselves Sahaja Yogis,

119
00:08:59,021 --> 00:09:02,687
so we face the temptation
of external religions

120
00:09:02,888 --> 00:09:07,180
and this is what Shri Mataji
has tested for the last 10 years.

121
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:13,316
You see, if we are in Sahaja sthiti,

122
00:09:13,517 --> 00:09:17,211
the authority is within ourselves.

123
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,560
And I know...
Let’s say if I am in Sahaj sthiti,

124
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:24,990
I don’t need to quote Shri Mataji,

125
00:09:25,191 --> 00:09:29,794
I don’t need to tell, “Shri Mataji
said this, therefore you must follow”,

126
00:09:29,995 --> 00:09:33,255
because you will feel my vibrations

127
00:09:33,456 --> 00:09:36,904
and you will know
that what I say is true.

128
00:09:37,105 --> 00:09:39,068
That is the sthiti.

129
00:09:39,269 --> 00:09:43,310
But we, if we are not
in Sahaj sthiti, then

130
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:47,104
we look for the authority outside,

131
00:09:47,441 --> 00:09:48,979
ok?
Outside.

132
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,676
External religion
look for authority outside.

133
00:09:51,877 --> 00:09:54,512
So, for instance, you are...
(video paused)

134
00:09:54,713 --> 00:10:00,122
So when... of the Catholic
or the Sunni model, where somebody

135
00:10:01,917 --> 00:10:05,802
will follow the pope or the caliph

136
00:10:06,003 --> 00:10:09,786
in the name of Christ
or in the name of Allah.

137
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:13,812
They don't follow Christ or Allah,
they follow the pope or the caliph.

138
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:17,749
This model of externalisation
we had to test it,

139
00:10:17,950 --> 00:10:21,187
because in our collectivity
we did have some people,

140
00:10:21,388 --> 00:10:24,568
who would follow one individual
or another,

141
00:10:24,769 --> 00:10:27,296
thinking that this is the authority
we have to follow.

142
00:10:27,497 --> 00:10:29,805
But if we keep our discrimination,

143
00:10:30,006 --> 00:10:34,789
we take all the inputs that
we have to, but we follow Shri Mataji

144
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:36,990
only like Shri Ganesha.

145
00:10:38,076 --> 00:10:41,266
Now, another temptation
of external religion,

146
00:10:41,467 --> 00:10:45,005
which also has been tested
is hierarchies.

147
00:10:45,841 --> 00:10:48,638
Hierarchies.

148
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:52,742
You see if you have
bureaucrats as leaders,

149
00:10:52,943 --> 00:10:57,227
then, you know, like a shoemaker,
he is making shoes,

150
00:10:57,428 --> 00:11:01,849
a bureaucrat is making bureaucracies.
I am a bureaucrat, I know.

151
00:11:02,584 --> 00:11:06,906
I ended my career acting
Assistant Secretary General,

152
00:11:07,107 --> 00:11:11,578
and I was... You know, when we were
in the castle with Shri Mataji, I was

153
00:11:11,779 --> 00:11:15,289
a bit naughty,
I was sort of teasing Sir CP

154
00:11:15,490 --> 00:11:18,875
and I was telling, “Shri Mataji,
I am one level below sir CP,

155
00:11:19,076 --> 00:11:22,029
I will always remain
one level below sir CP”

156
00:11:22,490 --> 00:11:25,266
But you see,
the business of our democrats...

157
00:11:25,467 --> 00:11:32,463
because we have
the temptation for hierarchy,

158
00:11:32,664 --> 00:11:34,982
we have the temptation
for bureaucracy,

159
00:11:35,183 --> 00:11:38,154
we have the temptation
for rules and regulations

160
00:11:38,355 --> 00:11:41,491
and some people
even wrote the rules

161
00:11:41,692 --> 00:11:44,613
how to take vibrations
with little envelopes.

162
00:11:44,814 --> 00:11:49,182
All of a sudden, we were in the world
of complete idiocy.

163
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,703
Where did you get lost?

164
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:03,388
You see, with bureaucracy
you get lost anyway.

165
00:12:06,302 --> 00:12:09,094
Then another temptation
of external religion,

166
00:12:09,295 --> 00:12:12,654
because you structure
all this nicely

167
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:17,924
and it's like the shell,
but the sthiti is not there.

168
00:12:18,125 --> 00:12:21,715
Because the more shell you have,
the less sthiti you have.

169
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:25,952
So, you see, another temptation
you have to understand,

170
00:12:26,153 --> 00:12:29,027
of the external religion, is

171
00:12:29,531 --> 00:12:31,900
- you understand the word
“to proselytise”? -

172
00:12:32,101 --> 00:12:34,844
is to convert to the new faith.

173
00:12:36,063 --> 00:12:39,940
In the new faith. You convert
people to the new faith.

174
00:12:40,141 --> 00:12:43,870
Because it's like an activity,
it’s like, you know,

175
00:12:44,071 --> 00:12:47,737
you do more programs,
you have more ashrams,

176
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:51,034
you are a little bit
like a salesman of coca-cola:

177
00:12:51,235 --> 00:12:54,789
you sell more bottles,
you give more realisations.

178
00:12:55,305 --> 00:12:59,781
You see, the model for this is
Paul, Saint Paul.

179
00:13:00,047 --> 00:13:02,164
He was never with Christ,

180
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:06,393
he didn’t know Christ,
he didn’t listen to Christ

181
00:13:06,594 --> 00:13:11,206
and all of a sudden he was
the big leader in Christianity,

182
00:13:11,407 --> 00:13:15,143
busy writing letters,
organising public programs,

183
00:13:15,344 --> 00:13:17,862
organising bhajan groups.

184
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:20,490
We have also those characters.

185
00:13:20,691 --> 00:13:23,896
Now, we have to understand,
Shri Mataji did say,

186
00:13:24,097 --> 00:13:26,630
our job is to give realisation

187
00:13:26,831 --> 00:13:31,260
and our job is
to make people Sahaja yogis.

188
00:13:31,784 --> 00:13:35,263
But if I am not a Sahaja yogi,

189
00:13:35,464 --> 00:13:37,638
if I am NOT in Sahaj sthiti,

190
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:40,753
how am I going to do that?

191
00:13:41,292 --> 00:13:45,763
If you want to give drawing lessons
in the school to the child,

192
00:13:45,964 --> 00:13:47,841
you need to know drawing.

193
00:13:48,042 --> 00:13:50,927
If you want to bring
to the world "The world of Sahaj",

194
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:54,557
you need to manifest
the world of Sahaj.

195
00:13:56,448 --> 00:14:01,651
These are variations on a theme that
you know (centrifugal and centripetal).

196
00:14:02,042 --> 00:14:06,364
But when you see it
in the context of the 10 last years

197
00:14:06,565 --> 00:14:09,729
that we went through,
which were very difficult,

198
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:14,953
you understand that Shri Mataji
has tested these 2 forces.

199
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:22,250
And the master of the testing
is called Mahamaya,

200
00:14:22,602 --> 00:14:27,174
so She is the One, who tests, She is
the One, who gives the notes, not us.

201
00:14:27,375 --> 00:14:29,729
What we can try
is to do our best.

202
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:32,940
But what I’d like to suggest,
is our best,

203
00:14:33,141 --> 00:14:38,495
is to understand that
Sahaja sthiti,

204
00:14:38,696 --> 00:14:41,320
the reality of Sahaja Yoga,

205
00:14:41,594 --> 00:14:46,703
is not about having ashrams,
having council,

206
00:14:48,383 --> 00:14:53,370
singing bhajans even, although
of course, it’s all part of it,

207
00:14:53,571 --> 00:14:57,674
but the essence of it is to be
in that Sahaja state.

208
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:59,875
And if we are honest,

209
00:15:00,141 --> 00:15:03,440
if we are honest
and we look at 24 hours,

210
00:15:03,641 --> 00:15:08,174
we can say, “Ok, how many of those
24 hours am I in a Sahaj state?”

211
00:15:08,375 --> 00:15:11,440
Let’s ask us this question,
honestly!

212
00:15:11,641 --> 00:15:13,641
Because honesty brings light

213
00:15:13,842 --> 00:15:17,950
and in the light we see
and in seeing we correct (ourselves).

214
00:15:18,167 --> 00:15:22,626
So this is 25 years
of Sahaja Yoga in Hungary,

215
00:15:22,827 --> 00:15:27,018
let’s give a hand
to all the Hungarian Sahaja yogis.

216
00:15:39,678 --> 00:15:42,638
Ok, what is the inner religion?

217
00:15:44,083 --> 00:15:49,693
The inner religion means
going to the axis of planet Sahaja.

218
00:15:49,958 --> 00:15:53,654
Now, what is the axis
of the planet Sahaja?

219
00:16:04,379 --> 00:16:07,958
You know the story
where there was

220
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:12,482
a discussion among the...

221
00:16:12,683 --> 00:16:14,703
Don’t ask me
to explain that, ok?

222
00:16:14,904 --> 00:16:18,424
The story is that there was
a discussion among the Trimurtis -

223
00:16:18,625 --> 00:16:22,805
who is the biggest: is it, Shri Shiva,
is it Shri Vishnu or is it Shri Brahma?

224
00:16:23,006 --> 00:16:26,638
And then they saw the lingam,
(symbol of Shri Shiva).

225
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,380
So the story goes that...

226
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:40,146
So the story is that the swan
of Shri, Brahma went up

227
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,523
to find out,
where was the end of the lingam

228
00:16:43,724 --> 00:16:47,094
and Vishnu took the form
of a boar

229
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:52,750
to dig into the earth to find,
where was the bottom of the lingam?

230
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:55,669
My boar is not very good, but...

231
00:16:56,482 --> 00:16:59,161
And so they could not find it.

232
00:16:59,575 --> 00:17:04,195
But Brahmadeva cheated,
because He said, that He found it,

233
00:17:04,396 --> 00:17:07,740
while Vishnu was honest, He said,
“I cannot find the other end.”

234
00:17:07,941 --> 00:17:11,680
So, as a result, they say, Brahmadeva
is not worshipped in India.

235
00:17:11,881 --> 00:17:15,180
But the sense of this anecdote

236
00:17:15,381 --> 00:17:19,724
is that the axis of planet Sahaj
is the lingam.

237
00:17:20,917 --> 00:17:26,560
And this is what Shri Mataji tells us,
when She started a public program.

238
00:17:27,443 --> 00:17:31,740
She said firstly,
“I bow to the seekers of Truth”,

239
00:17:33,021 --> 00:17:38,320
and, by the way, we still need to have
the courage to stand by the Truth,

240
00:17:38,521 --> 00:17:41,794
when we are Sahaja yogis…
by the way.

241
00:17:42,224 --> 00:17:48,693
And point two is that She said,
“The Truth is that you are the Spirit”.

242
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:55,810
And the Spirit is Shri Shiva

243
00:17:56,631 --> 00:18:03,836
in the sense, that our consciousness
goes into the Truth of the Sahaj sthiti

244
00:18:04,037 --> 00:18:05,529
which is joy.

245
00:18:05,771 --> 00:18:10,727
So the destination
of the inner religion is the axis

246
00:18:10,928 --> 00:18:12,789
of the Sahaja planet.

247
00:18:12,990 --> 00:18:19,112
And this is why we are also going
to celebrate Shiva puja tomorrow.

248
00:18:23,289 --> 00:18:27,667
Our journey,
my sisters and my brothers,

249
00:18:27,868 --> 00:18:32,734
our journey
is the story of the return,

250
00:18:33,657 --> 00:18:35,657
we return home.

251
00:18:36,954 --> 00:18:40,893
We went through this long adventure,

252
00:18:41,094 --> 00:18:46,461
we went through this long picnic,
which is called human existence,

253
00:18:48,555 --> 00:18:51,573
and now we are
on the way to the return

254
00:18:51,774 --> 00:18:54,305
from where we came from.

255
00:18:54,542 --> 00:18:57,182
While being in human consciousness,

256
00:18:57,383 --> 00:19:00,612
because we came from God
and we return to God.

257
00:19:00,813 --> 00:19:06,958
So this is if you want,
this is a little snapshot of the axis.

258
00:19:07,667 --> 00:19:10,351
Here you have the material world...

259
00:19:15,289 --> 00:19:17,109
Someone was hurt?

260
00:19:19,516 --> 00:19:22,508
Well, that’s the material world,
I suppose.

261
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:27,000
Yeah,
I think is safer to put it down.

262
00:19:30,125 --> 00:19:32,726
Now, this is nicely timed,

263
00:19:33,016 --> 00:19:36,273
because the material world
will pass away,

264
00:19:37,547 --> 00:19:40,424
but we will dwell in eternity,

265
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,828
because eternity is our home.

266
00:19:43,680 --> 00:19:46,065
On the trip the return,

267
00:19:46,266 --> 00:19:48,984
we are here in the material world,

268
00:19:52,493 --> 00:19:58,737
and there is also where you have
this play of the Maya,

269
00:19:58,938 --> 00:20:01,357
of the centrifugal
and the centripetal,

270
00:20:01,558 --> 00:20:05,779
but in the history of mankind,
in the history of religions

271
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:12,096
this journey took place
and first, we crossed the Devalok.

272
00:20:12,972 --> 00:20:19,081
Devalok is when our ancestors
worshipped the Deva.

273
00:20:19,831 --> 00:20:24,841
So, for instance, Zoroastrians
worshipped the Fire,

274
00:20:25,042 --> 00:20:27,776
the Incas worshipped Surya,

275
00:20:28,386 --> 00:20:31,755
the Greeks, you know,
with the pantheon,

276
00:20:31,956 --> 00:20:34,432
they worshipped the Devas.

277
00:20:35,362 --> 00:20:43,088
Then, more recently, you could say,
since the invention of science,

278
00:20:43,289 --> 00:20:45,791
we crossed the Brahmalok.

279
00:20:46,033 --> 00:20:49,598
Because Shri Brahma
is the great Sire of the Creation

280
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,990
and with science
we actually study what He has done.

281
00:20:55,191 --> 00:20:57,187
So, science is a study of God,

282
00:20:57,388 --> 00:21:00,656
but of course the scientists
don't know that, that’s obvious.

283
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:03,031
They think they study the matter.

284
00:21:03,232 --> 00:21:06,672
But they study matter as done
by the Creator of matter.

285
00:21:06,873 --> 00:21:10,880
So the entire scientific enquiry,

286
00:21:11,081 --> 00:21:14,310
which brought our society
to the state, where it is now,

287
00:21:14,763 --> 00:21:17,177
is going through the Brahmalok.

288
00:21:17,381 --> 00:21:18,891
And the next...

289
00:21:19,094 --> 00:21:23,190
I mean I have put Vaikuntha here,
that’s the Shri Vishnulok,

290
00:21:23,391 --> 00:21:25,736
but it’s not that
we went to Vaikuntha,

291
00:21:25,937 --> 00:21:31,552
but what happened is that,
we becoming seekers

292
00:21:31,753 --> 00:21:38,325
we started being an actor
in the drama of our own evolution.

293
00:21:38,545 --> 00:21:42,367
And seekers are not just
you and me sitting now.

294
00:21:42,568 --> 00:21:47,359
The pre-Socratic philosophers,
like Pythagoras

295
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,849
or Parmenides or...
(video pauzed)

296
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:54,766
were already dealing with the movement
of consciousness, the power of evolution.

297
00:21:54,967 --> 00:21:58,081
So, Boris,
I am going to finish very soon,

298
00:21:58,580 --> 00:22:03,224
because we arrived to
the axis of the axis (Sushumna Nadi)

299
00:22:03,425 --> 00:22:05,302
and here it is, the sthiti.

300
00:22:05,503 --> 00:22:10,560
You know, Shri Mataji teased us
and told us to count how many people

301
00:22:10,761 --> 00:22:15,466
we gave realisation. But believe me,
I never counted in my entire life,

302
00:22:15,667 --> 00:22:18,091
how many people
I gave realisation to,

303
00:22:18,292 --> 00:22:21,872
it’s enough for me,
if my Mother in the Heavens knows.

304
00:22:22,073 --> 00:22:26,104
But if we get ourselves
in the sthiti state,

305
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:32,161
then just our being there
will raise Kundalinis.

306
00:22:32,362 --> 00:22:35,757
Shri Mataji said once, “Look at Christ,
He only had 12 disciples,

307
00:22:35,958 --> 00:22:39,700
and see, how far Christianity went
and conquered the world.”

308
00:22:39,901 --> 00:22:44,253
She said, “I can transform the world
with 10 really good yogis.”

309
00:22:44,503 --> 00:22:47,357
So the journey for us
is towards the Stithi,

310
00:22:47,558 --> 00:22:52,318
because these are where then
we are going to get

311
00:22:52,519 --> 00:22:59,253
the blessings of Shri Shiva

312
00:22:59,472 --> 00:23:01,588
which is Kalyan.

313
00:23:02,409 --> 00:23:05,255
Kalyan, there is a speech
of Shri Mataji on this,

314
00:23:05,456 --> 00:23:06,513
maybe you can hear it.

315
00:23:06,714 --> 00:23:10,620
But Kalyan is the state where we are
blessed on all sides.

316
00:23:24,162 --> 00:23:26,297
If we can all understand

317
00:23:26,498 --> 00:23:33,375
that our most important job
is to be what we claim to be

318
00:23:33,724 --> 00:23:35,344
- the job is done.

319
00:23:35,545 --> 00:23:38,271
And I am very confident

320
00:23:38,623 --> 00:23:43,875
that we are all together
on the right path.

321
00:23:44,599 --> 00:23:49,491
You see, there is a relationship
between (seeking and finding)

322
00:23:49,692 --> 00:23:53,320
because seekers are
in the evolution bowl

323
00:23:53,521 --> 00:23:56,984
and yogis are not
in the evolution bowl.

324
00:23:57,185 --> 00:24:00,049
But there is a relationship
between the two.

325
00:24:01,386 --> 00:24:06,065
The link is in the name
of Shri Lakshmi,

326
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,377
Anantasta.

327
00:24:11,578 --> 00:24:14,530
Because Shri Lakshmi
is the power of evolution

328
00:24:14,731 --> 00:24:16,994
She is the Shakti of Shri Vishnu,
She becomes Mahalakshmi,

329
00:24:17,195 --> 00:24:20,534
She is the power of evolution.
Mahalakshmi is the power of evolution.

330
00:24:20,735 --> 00:24:24,778
There is a name Shri Lakshmi, where
She is said to be Anantasta,

331
00:24:24,979 --> 00:24:27,992
which means She resides in eternity.

332
00:24:28,532 --> 00:24:31,844
So, eternity
is the eternal present,

333
00:24:32,672 --> 00:24:37,625
eternity is when we are
in Nirvichara Samadhi,

334
00:24:37,857 --> 00:24:40,107
eternity is peaceful.

335
00:24:40,638 --> 00:24:45,966
So, before we were evolving
 through action-reaction,

336
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:48,594
synthesis, disorder,

337
00:24:48,795 --> 00:24:50,255
petitions,

338
00:24:50,638 --> 00:24:54,922
letters on the e-mail,
accusing, descending

339
00:24:55,123 --> 00:24:57,123
- that was before.

340
00:24:57,442 --> 00:25:01,531
Most yogis have the intelligence
to understand

341
00:25:01,732 --> 00:25:03,732
that this is not our model,

342
00:25:03,933 --> 00:25:10,042
most yogis understand that
evolution now for us is peaceful.

343
00:25:11,579 --> 00:25:15,500
We don't need to do anything
- we become.

344
00:25:16,610 --> 00:25:19,917
This is what Sahaj is.

345
00:25:20,766 --> 00:25:25,026
You will see temptations
to make out of Sahaj a cult,

346
00:25:25,227 --> 00:25:29,937
to make out of Sahaj a sect,
to make out of Sahaj a religion.

347
00:25:30,844 --> 00:25:35,018
Shri Mataji
through the 10 years of withdrawal

348
00:25:35,219 --> 00:25:40,667
has allowed those options
to develop in small doses,

349
00:25:41,211 --> 00:25:46,216
but this is processed by the collective
the consciousness of the yogis

350
00:25:46,417 --> 00:25:48,417
who are in Sahaja sthiti.

351
00:25:48,711 --> 00:25:53,135
So, you see, if we are as a collective,
we go to the Sahaj sthiti,

352
00:25:53,336 --> 00:25:55,674
which is the only direction
where we want to go,

353
00:25:55,875 --> 00:25:58,549
which is the reason
why you came to Sahaja Yoga.

354
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,237
We didn't come to Sahaja yoga...

355
00:26:01,438 --> 00:26:04,758
You came to Sahaja Yoga
to be Sat-Chitt-Ananda.

356
00:26:05,024 --> 00:26:07,659
And we all understand that we are all
brothers and sisters

357
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:10,797
we all want that
- there is no animosity,

358
00:26:11,172 --> 00:26:12,969
there is no fight,

359
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:15,917
there is forgiveness,
there is compassion

360
00:26:16,118 --> 00:26:19,833
but there is also the courage
to stand by the Truth,

361
00:26:21,657 --> 00:26:24,359
because the Truth is this
(the axis).

362
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:28,807
If yogis don't have the courage
to stand by the Truth,

363
00:26:29,008 --> 00:26:30,906
they miss the axis,

364
00:26:31,157 --> 00:26:34,070
and my sense is that in

365
00:26:34,875 --> 00:26:38,234
the collective overall there is,

366
00:26:38,435 --> 00:26:41,245
(even if they cannot explain it
in a speech like this),

367
00:26:41,446 --> 00:26:45,016
but there is an understanding
that this is what they want.

368
00:26:45,217 --> 00:26:48,430
And this is the reason
why there is progress in Sahaja Yoga,

369
00:26:48,631 --> 00:26:50,893
although you don't think so,
because you see division,

370
00:26:51,094 --> 00:26:58,271
you see fighting, you see various
things, but actually we are growing.

371
00:26:58,472 --> 00:27:02,776
There is more awareness,
there is more understanding.

372
00:27:03,151 --> 00:27:08,161
For instance, when we came here,
yesterday we arrived at this hotel

373
00:27:08,362 --> 00:27:11,802
you know,
this did not happen like that,

374
00:27:12,003 --> 00:27:17,375
when I was going to seminars
in Austria 25 years ago

375
00:27:17,667 --> 00:27:20,721
- you know, I arrived at the hotel,
I became thoughtless.

376
00:27:20,922 --> 00:27:22,482
Why did I become thoughtless?

377
00:27:22,683 --> 00:27:26,169
Not because of the hotel, but otherwise
I would give him one more star.

378
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:28,943
I became thoughtless
because all of you

379
00:27:29,144 --> 00:27:32,247
at that moment were coming,
driving towards this hotel

380
00:27:32,448 --> 00:27:35,924
with the desire to be
all together for this weekend.

381
00:27:38,268 --> 00:27:40,956
So let's have faith in ourselves.
