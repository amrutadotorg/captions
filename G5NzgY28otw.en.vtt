00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:25.519
To see so many Sahaja Yogis assembled here,
I’m sure the devil must have run away long

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:28.260
time back.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:44.219
And the caravan must have left but I hope
we are aware of it and we forget about our

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:52.310
fears of our catches, of our past, of all
the nonsense we have done so far.

00:03:52.310 --> 00:04:06.110
Suddenly in My presence, I think, people get
into a sense of guilt.

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:18.759
I’m here to soothe you, to cleanse you,
to make you beautiful and not to feel guilty.

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:33.520
Actually when we start
looking at ourselves the first thing you notice

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:43.000
is that there’s a block on the Agnya, but
this block in the Agnya is the worst thing

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:49.469
that can happen to us because it is the door
of the Kundalini.

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:53.940
She reaches up to Vishuddhi all right, and
then She has to move forward, this Agnya stops

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:54.940
it.

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:02.970
That’s why we have left Vishuddhi, we have
all the Vishuddhi problems.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:12.120
The flow cannot take place.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.770
Also this is one of the reasons we feel guilty
because of left Vishuddhi.

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:19.449
It’s a symptom of a disease.

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:24.620
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.550
So we have to understand first of all that
we’re Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:37.690
We’re not ordinary people or we’re not
people who have not known the truth; we have

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:38.690
known the truth.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.560
We have to be completely aware of it.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.060
That’s one truth if you establish, you have
established yourself quite a lot.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:54.350
Now the ordinary people as you have seen on
Oxford St., you see, they wear Indian dresses

00:05:54.350 --> 00:06:04.910
funnily tied, they don’t know how to tie
it up, dhotis and saris and they shake their

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:15.270
heads and buy some of these, what we call
them, shindis or bodhis or I don’t know

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:27.190
what you call, tails, pigtails, and attach
them with some glue and they start dancing.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:38.800
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,
and the saris and the dhotis, everything start

00:06:38.800 --> 00:06:40.539
opening out.

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:44.710
That’s a very funny, ridiculous scene.

00:06:44.710 --> 00:06:49.380
One side you see the punks and another side
you see this nonsense, in the name of Shri

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:50.380
Krishna, that’s even worse.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:55.449
Punks do not do it in the name of, I don’t
know if they do it in the name of King Solomon.

00:06:55.449 --> 00:07:05.199
But they do it in somebody’s name, these
people that is so great as Shri Krishna.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:23.750
On the contrary, Shri Krishna’s hair are
described in all the books and in all the

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:28.539
poetry that poets could sing about.

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.729
He was never shaven-headed.

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:40.190
It is impossible to understand how these people
got the idea that you must shave your head.

00:07:40.190 --> 00:07:45.039
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara
has been so misunderstood.

00:07:45.039 --> 00:07:56.340
It’s absolutely misunderstood because we
cannot understand that the truth is covered

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:59.819
with maya, always.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:02.669
And you should keep maya on one side and go
to the truth.

00:08:02.669 --> 00:08:08.573
Instead of that, we get lost in the maya,
like very simple example, as it is, that He

00:08:08.573 --> 00:08:12.860
is a Yogeshwara; so these people have idea
of a yogi, that He should be shaven, He should

00:08:12.860 --> 00:08:17.839
wear that dhoti, dirty one, and must put on
a pigtail.

00:08:17.839 --> 00:08:22.729
Another concept, maya is a concept.

00:08:22.729 --> 00:08:27.589
And when you start living on those concepts
of your own, you may gather it up with something

00:08:27.589 --> 00:08:34.680
else, you may think that Christ was a person
who was a sanyasi, who used to wear another

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:37.829
kind of a robe and He had a beard and He had
hair like this.

00:08:37.829 --> 00:08:43.169
All those ideas, “So if we become like this,
we’d be very great yogis.”

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:50.128
These are all our concepts about someone whom
we have never seen, whom we have never known.

00:08:50.128 --> 00:08:59.330
And because we live with those concepts, we
get limited.

00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:10.380
It’s very difficult for these people to
break through because maya can only be broken

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380
through realization.

00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:14.640
That’s why first thing in Sahaja Yoga is
realization.

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:15.830
Take your realization.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:19.070
You are a drunkard, all right, get your realization.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:21.840
You are a drug addict, get your realization.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.070
You are a bad man, get your realization.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.890
Anyone, get your realization first; put the
light first into a person.

00:09:26.890 --> 00:09:30.480
Let him see for himself.

00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:40.120
So all this identification with different
concepts is responsible for giving us a very

00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:42.430
mayami or illusive personality.

00:09:42.430 --> 00:09:53.639
We live in an illusive personality, live with
it, enjoy it and we think we are perfectly

00:09:53.639 --> 00:09:55.589
all right.

00:09:55.589 --> 00:10:10.760
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis
and you have come here for Shri Krishna Puja,

00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:13.340
what is the preparation we have to do.

00:10:13.340 --> 00:10:20.529
We’re Sahaja Yogis, we know about Kundalini,
we know about Vishuddhis, we know about Shri

00:10:20.529 --> 00:10:21.769
Krishna.

00:10:21.769 --> 00:10:34.449
All right, how are we going to prepare ourselves
for the puja of Shri Krishna?

00:10:34.449 --> 00:10:40.750
First of all, He tried to break all the concepts.

00:10:40.750 --> 00:10:56.649
First the concept He broke was that you have
to be like a ascetic to look.

00:10:56.649 --> 00:11:04.339
He broke this concept; He lived like the king.

00:11:04.339 --> 00:11:13.370
In His childhood He used to go and play with
the cows.

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:29.930
And there He would use a peacock’s feather
to decorate Himself, and He would listen to

00:11:29.930 --> 00:11:35.230
beautiful music of the river Yamuna and reproduce
it.

00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:45.440
He was leelala, He was the one who created
all kinds of mirth.

00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:53.499
What is mirth in French?

00:11:53.499 --> 00:12:03.180
They don’t have mirth, I believe.

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:11.480
It’s not fun, it’s more than… , it’s
mirth.

00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:19.649
Mirth is sweeter than fun, all right, sweet
fun.

00:12:19.649 --> 00:12:23.410
What a word!

00:12:23.410 --> 00:12:28.149
Sweet fun!

00:12:28.149 --> 00:12:37.129
This is mirth, now what is happening
to you is mirth.

00:12:37.129 --> 00:12:43.680
I’m creating mirth in which you feel tickled,
you know.

00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:50.269
Mirth is something where you feel tickled.

00:12:50.269 --> 00:13:00.779
So He tried to create mirth, never seriousness
but He was not frivolous.

00:13:00.779 --> 00:13:02.600
He was Yogeshwara.

00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:15.629
He was not frivolous, so this difference between
frivolity and mirth is to be understood only

00:13:15.629 --> 00:13:25.300
through Him because He’s also discretion.

00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:36.509
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is destructive.

00:13:36.509 --> 00:13:45.850
Anything frivolous if you do…

00:13:45.850 --> 00:14:02.100
So we have to be in a state of mirth, so no
question of feeling guilty comes in, you’re

00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.059
not prisoners are we?

00:14:06.059 --> 00:14:14.589
We’re prisoners of our own concepts and
our own ideas and our own degradation.

00:14:14.589 --> 00:14:19.619
We degrade ourselves, God does not.

00:14:19.619 --> 00:14:32.970
So we should be in the state of complete mirth
and enjoyment.

00:14:32.970 --> 00:14:36.920
Now it has rained, all right.

00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:40.899
That’s a very good thing to happen today.

00:14:40.899 --> 00:14:42.300
Yesterday I was listening to the program,
I was just smiling, because I knew it would

00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:55.649
not work out that way.

00:14:55.649 --> 00:15:07.100
And in India, on this day, when they celebrate
in the morning, children of the village or

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:16.040
children of the particular areas gather together.

00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:27.430
And for them the house-holders tie a little
pitcher, which we call as a matka, and in

00:15:27.430 --> 00:15:32.410
that there is money, anything valuable they
want to give to the children, sweets, everything

00:15:32.410 --> 00:15:37.749
put inside, and is tied up in the air.

00:15:37.749 --> 00:15:45.399
Normally it rains, if it doesn’t rain then
they pour water on the children to make them

00:15:45.399 --> 00:15:46.550
feel it’s raining.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:54.629
Rain is very much connected with Shri Krishna.

00:15:54.629 --> 00:16:03.470
So the children come and they go in a way
that the taller boys are first, then smaller,

00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:09.480
then smaller like a pyramid they go up till
at the end there’s one boy who’s sort

00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:14.800
of representing Shri Krishna and then he breaks
that.

00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:22.220
And from there everything falls down and flowers,
everything on them, they take the money, they

00:16:22.220 --> 00:16:25.870
take all those things and start enjoying.

00:16:25.870 --> 00:16:33.509
Then they go to another place, the whole day
they are moving in the city like that and

00:16:33.509 --> 00:16:47.660
every good house-holder ties that matka for
these children, for them to come and enjoy

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.660
themselves.

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:58.309
That’s in the real sense, is the Krishna
Astami in Gokul where He lived as a child.

00:16:58.309 --> 00:17:03.379
Now why is He so much connected with rain?

00:17:03.379 --> 00:17:22.230
Once all His friends and He were looking after
the cows and Indra felt that He is very powerful,

00:17:22.230 --> 00:17:35.900
somehow, I don’t know, He gets into jealousies
sometimes.

00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:52.410
And He sent rain to test His patience, His
leela, His play, His mirth.

00:17:52.410 --> 00:18:02.870
It rained and rained and rained and they did
not know what to do.

00:18:02.870 --> 00:18:07.500
So there was a mountain called Govardhan.

00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:17.690
Shri Krishna lifted it with His stick or His
finger and just put it up on top of His finger,

00:18:17.690 --> 00:18:18.690
like that.

00:18:18.690 --> 00:18:23.760
That’s why He is called as Govardhan Dhari.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:34.420
And the whole mountain was on top and all
the children joined Him and now the cows and

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:44.140
He asked the children, “You also put your
sticks up to help.”

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:49.240
And they all put their sticks and standing
very sweetly holding the Govardhan.

00:18:49.240 --> 00:19:02.049
That is one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

00:19:02.049 --> 00:19:08.760
So the rain had to come and the cows with
their bells have to remind us.

00:19:08.760 --> 00:19:17.990
Imagine the lake has a name which is a black;
Krishna means black, Krishna word itself means

00:19:17.990 --> 00:19:19.050
black.

00:19:19.050 --> 00:19:24.570
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out.

00:19:24.570 --> 00:19:33.290
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj
but are so .

00:19:33.290 --> 00:19:46.410
And here we are sitting, it’s raining, nicely
enjoying everything.

00:19:46.410 --> 00:20:03.580
But on the contrary when we start not enjoying
we play into, either into our ego or superego.

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:18.929
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people, then we start making others like ourselves.

00:20:18.929 --> 00:20:25.350
We like to make them suffer and torture them.

00:20:25.350 --> 00:20:31.470
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is leprosy.”

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:36.059
Anybody who is in poverty can develop horrible
things within themselves.

00:20:36.059 --> 00:20:45.780
It is never to be sided with, not to be sympathized
but to be completely eradicated.

00:20:45.780 --> 00:20:53.000
Another side is the ego where we try to dominate
others and enjoy that.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.649
There’s no joy, there’s no joy in dominating
others and saying things to others.

00:20:58.649 --> 00:21:03.429
I was sorry to hear yesterday that there are
some girls who are married, some Indian girls

00:21:03.429 --> 00:21:09.350
who are married and their husbands are not
respecting them and troubling them.

00:21:09.350 --> 00:21:11.990
It hurt Me very much.

00:21:11.990 --> 00:21:17.260
That shows they’re so low level people,
very low level.

00:21:17.260 --> 00:21:18.389
Such a mediocracy, such useless people.

00:21:18.389 --> 00:21:23.590
They should have never come to Sahaja Yoga
and deceived us like this.

00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:32.769
They will go to hell direct, I can tell you
this.

00:21:32.769 --> 00:21:39.769
Now there are some who are caught up with
their superego; they suffer from some sort

00:21:39.769 --> 00:21:46.059
of a funny Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia.

00:21:46.059 --> 00:21:53.450
And they don’t want to get rid or it.

00:21:53.450 --> 00:21:58.470
They just don’t want to understand that
they’re not normal people, they have to

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:02.160
be perfectly all right.

00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:12.299
They make everyone miserable, jump on to all
the places where they should not be.

00:22:12.299 --> 00:22:18.710
Like a person who has got, say, example, tuberculosis,
a disease which is contagious.

00:22:18.710 --> 00:22:28.570
Must understand he has got tuberculosis, keep
out, don’t give it to others, at least.

00:22:28.570 --> 00:22:37.000
But those who have got badhas will definitely
come, either they’ll give big lectures.

00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:47.410
I start seeing them like big bhoots speaking,
or if not they have badhas then they will

00:22:47.410 --> 00:22:49.990
come at a place where they should not be.

00:22:49.990 --> 00:22:54.340
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,

00:22:54.340 --> 00:22:55.340
all kinds of things they’ll be doing, catching
people.

00:22:55.340 --> 00:23:04.669
And they enjoy it because they are identified
with the badhas.

00:23:04.669 --> 00:23:13.100
How will they improve?

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:20.120
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish fellow,
we have had him for, I think, for at least

00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:29.730
for a century I should say, and he’s giving
lectures to others, “You must clean the

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:34.610
shoes of all the Sahaja Yogis to get rid of
your ego.”

00:23:34.610 --> 00:23:46.029
So such a gross, depraved and low level people
are still in Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:46.029 --> 00:23:50.639
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes less.

00:23:50.639 --> 00:23:53.990
If you eat rice with stones in it, how will
you enjoy it?

00:23:53.990 --> 00:23:59.519
And that’s what it is.

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:16.730
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,
to have the mirth but still we are living

00:24:16.730 --> 00:24:23.760
with all joy-killing things that we have.

00:24:23.760 --> 00:24:30.610
How are we going to get rid of those things.

00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:39.190
So at least we do not become thorns in the
lives of others.

00:24:39.190 --> 00:24:45.309
So the so-called free will, I’m happy Rustom
has told you about it, is nothing but your

00:24:45.309 --> 00:24:50.139
ego and superego because you’re not in the
center.

00:24:50.139 --> 00:25:03.080
In the center, you have nothing but freedom,
that’s all, nothing but freedom; nothing

00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:08.450
like free will, freedom, complete freedom.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:24.980
There’s nothing like will or nothing like
bhoots, nothing like bondage, it’s entire

00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:29.779
avenue of freedom.

00:25:29.779 --> 00:25:44.450
Then this freedom is the knowledge, this freedom
is the love, this freedom is the discretion.

00:25:44.450 --> 00:25:57.140
Then you say God gives you freedom and others
freedom equally then you act which doesn’t

00:25:57.140 --> 00:26:07.929
bound you nor anybody else because it is knowledge,
it is discretion.

00:26:07.929 --> 00:26:16.080
Age does not matter, what age you are.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:26.600
I’ve seen some also very old people singing
beautifully and enjoying Sahaja Yoga and make

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:29.149
Me enjoy also.

00:26:29.149 --> 00:26:34.980
Life is for us to enjoy, nothing else.

00:26:34.980 --> 00:26:38.279
But because we’re not free people, we cannot
enjoy.

00:26:38.279 --> 00:26:50.620
There is no bondage of any evil thought which
keeps you down.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:27:11.600
It is so subtle but penetrating into every
that is gross, that is Shri Krishna’s beautiful

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:19.740
flute which creates a picture of the nature.

00:27:19.740 --> 00:27:28.460
The description , the
whole thing becomes silent like a picture.

00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:36.470
So this evening we’ll have the puja, we’ll
have all the enjoyment of Shri Krishna’s

00:27:36.470 --> 00:27:37.470
blessings upon us.

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:54.760
There’s no end to the stories of Shri Krishna,
all full of mirth and play and innocence that

00:27:54.760 --> 00:27:57.850
kills rakshashas, devils.

00:27:57.850 --> 00:28:10.029
So today I’ve talked to you about His childhood,
and the puja I’ll tell you about Gita.

00:28:10.029 --> 00:28:11.869
May God bless you.
