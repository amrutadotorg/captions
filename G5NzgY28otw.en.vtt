WEBVTT

03:16.349 --> 03:25.519
To see so many Sahaja Yogis assembled here,
I’m sure the devil must have run away long

03:25.519 --> 03:28.260
time back.

03:28.260 --> 03:44.219
And the caravan must have left but I hope
we are aware of it and we forget about our

03:44.219 --> 03:52.310
fears of our catches, of our past, of all
the nonsense we have done so far.

03:52.310 --> 04:06.110
Suddenly in My presence, I think, people get
into a sense of guilt.

04:06.110 --> 04:18.759
I’m here to soothe you, to cleanse you,
to make you beautiful and not to feel guilty.

04:18.759 --> 04:33.520
Actually when we start
looking at ourselves the first thing you notice

04:33.520 --> 04:43.000
is that there’s a block on the Agnya, but
this block in the Agnya is the worst thing

04:43.000 --> 04:49.469
that can happen to us because it is the door
of the Kundalini.

04:49.469 --> 04:53.940
She reaches up to Vishuddhi all right, and
then She has to move forward, this Agnya stops

04:53.940 --> 04:54.940
it.

04:54.940 --> 05:02.970
That’s why we have left Vishuddhi, we have
all the Vishuddhi problems.

05:02.970 --> 05:12.120
The flow cannot take place.

05:12.120 --> 05:16.770
Also this is one of the reasons we feel guilty
because of left Vishuddhi.

05:16.770 --> 05:19.449
It’s a symptom of a disease.

05:19.449 --> 05:24.620
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna.

05:24.620 --> 05:28.550
So we have to understand first of all that
we’re Sahaja Yogis.

05:28.550 --> 05:37.690
We’re not ordinary people or we’re not
people who have not known the truth; we have

05:37.690 --> 05:38.690
known the truth.

05:38.690 --> 05:40.560
We have to be completely aware of it.

05:40.560 --> 05:46.060
That’s one truth if you establish, you have
established yourself quite a lot.

05:46.060 --> 05:54.350
Now the ordinary people as you have seen on
Oxford St., you see, they wear Indian dresses

05:54.350 --> 06:04.910
funnily tied, they don’t know how to tie
it up, dhotis and saris and they shake their

06:04.910 --> 06:15.270
heads and buy some of these, what we call
them, shindis or bodhis or I don’t know

06:15.270 --> 06:27.190
what you call, tails, pigtails, and attach
them with some glue and they start dancing.

06:27.190 --> 06:38.800
When they dance, their pigtail falls off,
and the saris and the dhotis, everything start

06:38.800 --> 06:40.539
opening out.

06:40.539 --> 06:44.710
That’s a very funny, ridiculous scene.

06:44.710 --> 06:49.380
One side you see the punks and another side
you see this nonsense, in the name of Shri

06:49.380 --> 06:50.380
Krishna, that’s even worse.

06:50.380 --> 06:55.449
Punks do not do it in the name of, I don’t
know if they do it in the name of King Solomon.

06:55.449 --> 07:05.199
But they do it in somebody’s name, these
people that is so great as Shri Krishna.

07:05.199 --> 07:23.750
On the contrary, Shri Krishna’s hair are
described in all the books and in all the

07:23.750 --> 07:28.539
poetry that poets could sing about.

07:28.539 --> 07:31.729
He was never shaven-headed.

07:31.729 --> 07:40.190
It is impossible to understand how these people
got the idea that you must shave your head.

07:40.190 --> 07:45.039
So the Shri Krishna’s aspect of Yogeshwara
has been so misunderstood.

07:45.039 --> 07:56.340
It’s absolutely misunderstood because we
cannot understand that the truth is covered

07:56.340 --> 07:59.819
with maya, always.

07:59.819 --> 08:02.669
And you should keep maya on one side and go
to the truth.

08:02.669 --> 08:08.573
Instead of that, we get lost in the maya,
like very simple example, as it is, that He

08:08.573 --> 08:12.860
is a Yogeshwara; so these people have idea
of a yogi, that He should be shaven, He should

08:12.860 --> 08:17.839
wear that dhoti, dirty one, and must put on
a pigtail.

08:17.839 --> 08:22.729
Another concept, maya is a concept.

08:22.729 --> 08:27.589
And when you start living on those concepts
of your own, you may gather it up with something

08:27.589 --> 08:34.680
else, you may think that Christ was a person
who was a sanyasi, who used to wear another

08:34.680 --> 08:37.829
kind of a robe and He had a beard and He had
hair like this.

08:37.829 --> 08:43.169
All those ideas, “So if we become like this,
we’d be very great yogis.”

08:43.169 --> 08:50.128
These are all our concepts about someone whom
we have never seen, whom we have never known.

08:50.128 --> 08:59.330
And because we live with those concepts, we
get limited.

08:59.330 --> 09:10.380
It’s very difficult for these people to
break through because maya can only be broken

09:10.380 --> 09:11.380
through realization.

09:11.380 --> 09:14.640
That’s why first thing in Sahaja Yoga is
realization.

09:14.640 --> 09:15.830
Take your realization.

09:15.830 --> 09:19.070
You are a drunkard, all right, get your realization.

09:19.070 --> 09:21.840
You are a drug addict, get your realization.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.070
You are a bad man, get your realization.

09:24.070 --> 09:26.890
Anyone, get your realization first; put the
light first into a person.

09:26.890 --> 09:30.480
Let him see for himself.

09:30.480 --> 09:40.120
So all this identification with different
concepts is responsible for giving us a very

09:40.120 --> 09:42.430
mayami or illusive personality.

09:42.430 --> 09:53.639
We live in an illusive personality, live with
it, enjoy it and we think we are perfectly

09:53.639 --> 09:55.589
all right.

09:55.589 --> 10:10.760
Now if you are aware you are Sahaja Yogis
and you have come here for Shri Krishna Puja,

10:10.760 --> 10:13.340
what is the preparation we have to do.

10:13.340 --> 10:20.529
We’re Sahaja Yogis, we know about Kundalini,
we know about Vishuddhis, we know about Shri

10:20.529 --> 10:21.769
Krishna.

10:21.769 --> 10:34.449
All right, how are we going to prepare ourselves
for the puja of Shri Krishna?

10:34.449 --> 10:40.750
First of all, He tried to break all the concepts.

10:40.750 --> 10:56.649
First the concept He broke was that you have
to be like a ascetic to look.

10:56.649 --> 11:04.339
He broke this concept; He lived like the king.

11:04.339 --> 11:13.370
In His childhood He used to go and play with
the cows.

11:13.370 --> 11:29.930
And there He would use a peacock’s feather
to decorate Himself, and He would listen to

11:29.930 --> 11:35.230
beautiful music of the river Yamuna and reproduce
it.

11:35.230 --> 11:45.440
He was leelala, He was the one who created
all kinds of mirth.

11:45.440 --> 11:53.499
What is mirth in French?

11:53.499 --> 12:03.180
They don’t have mirth, I believe.

12:03.180 --> 12:11.480
It’s not fun, it’s more than… , it’s
mirth.

12:11.480 --> 12:19.649
Mirth is sweeter than fun, all right, sweet
fun.

12:19.649 --> 12:23.410
What a word!

12:23.410 --> 12:28.149
Sweet fun!

12:28.149 --> 12:37.129
This is mirth, now what is happening
to you is mirth.

12:37.129 --> 12:43.680
I’m creating mirth in which you feel tickled,
you know.

12:43.680 --> 12:50.269
Mirth is something where you feel tickled.

12:50.269 --> 13:00.779
So He tried to create mirth, never seriousness
but He was not frivolous.

13:00.779 --> 13:02.600
He was Yogeshwara.

13:02.600 --> 13:15.629
He was not frivolous, so this difference between
frivolity and mirth is to be understood only

13:15.629 --> 13:25.300
through Him because He’s also discretion.

13:25.300 --> 13:36.509
Mirth is joy-giving, frivolity is destructive.

13:36.509 --> 13:45.850
Anything frivolous if you do…

13:45.850 --> 14:02.100
So we have to be in a state of mirth, so no
question of feeling guilty comes in, you’re

14:02.100 --> 14:06.059
not prisoners are we?

14:06.059 --> 14:14.589
We’re prisoners of our own concepts and
our own ideas and our own degradation.

14:14.589 --> 14:19.619
We degrade ourselves, God does not.

14:19.619 --> 14:32.970
So we should be in the state of complete mirth
and enjoyment.

14:32.970 --> 14:36.920
Now it has rained, all right.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.899
That’s a very good thing to happen today.

14:40.899 --> 14:42.300
Yesterday I was listening to the program,
I was just smiling, because I knew it would

14:42.300 --> 14:55.649
not work out that way.

14:55.649 --> 15:07.100
And in India, on this day, when they celebrate
in the morning, children of the village or

15:07.100 --> 15:16.040
children of the particular areas gather together.

15:16.040 --> 15:27.430
And for them the house-holders tie a little
pitcher, which we call as a matka, and in

15:27.430 --> 15:32.410
that there is money, anything valuable they
want to give to the children, sweets, everything

15:32.410 --> 15:37.749
put inside, and is tied up in the air.

15:37.749 --> 15:45.399
Normally it rains, if it doesn’t rain then
they pour water on the children to make them

15:45.399 --> 15:46.550
feel it’s raining.

15:46.550 --> 15:54.629
Rain is very much connected with Shri Krishna.

15:54.629 --> 16:03.470
So the children come and they go in a way
that the taller boys are first, then smaller,

16:03.470 --> 16:09.480
then smaller like a pyramid they go up till
at the end there’s one boy who’s sort

16:09.480 --> 16:14.800
of representing Shri Krishna and then he breaks
that.

16:14.800 --> 16:22.220
And from there everything falls down and flowers,
everything on them, they take the money, they

16:22.220 --> 16:25.870
take all those things and start enjoying.

16:25.870 --> 16:33.509
Then they go to another place, the whole day
they are moving in the city like that and

16:33.509 --> 16:47.660
every good house-holder ties that matka for
these children, for them to come and enjoy

16:47.660 --> 16:48.660
themselves.

16:48.660 --> 16:58.309
That’s in the real sense, is the Krishna
Astami in Gokul where He lived as a child.

16:58.309 --> 17:03.379
Now why is He so much connected with rain?

17:03.379 --> 17:22.230
Once all His friends and He were looking after
the cows and Indra felt that He is very powerful,

17:22.230 --> 17:35.900
somehow, I don’t know, He gets into jealousies
sometimes.

17:35.900 --> 17:52.410
And He sent rain to test His patience, His
leela, His play, His mirth.

17:52.410 --> 18:02.870
It rained and rained and rained and they did
not know what to do.

18:02.870 --> 18:07.500
So there was a mountain called Govardhan.

18:07.500 --> 18:17.690
Shri Krishna lifted it with His stick or His
finger and just put it up on top of His finger,

18:17.690 --> 18:18.690
like that.

18:18.690 --> 18:23.760
That’s why He is called as Govardhan Dhari.

18:23.760 --> 18:34.420
And the whole mountain was on top and all
the children joined Him and now the cows and

18:34.420 --> 18:44.140
He asked the children, “You also put your
sticks up to help.”

18:44.140 --> 18:49.240
And they all put their sticks and standing
very sweetly holding the Govardhan.

18:49.240 --> 19:02.049
That is one of His names, Govardhan Dhari.

19:02.049 --> 19:08.760
So the rain had to come and the cows with
their bells have to remind us.

19:08.760 --> 19:17.990
Imagine the lake has a name which is a black;
Krishna means black, Krishna word itself means

19:17.990 --> 19:19.050
black.

19:19.050 --> 19:24.570
How Sahaj the whole thing has worked out.

19:24.570 --> 19:33.290
Can you see the coincidences are so Sahaj
but are so .

19:33.290 --> 19:46.410
And here we are sitting, it’s raining, nicely
enjoying everything.

19:46.410 --> 20:03.580
But on the contrary when we start not enjoying
we play into, either into our ego or superego.

20:03.580 --> 20:18.929
Supposing we are starved people, tortured
people, then we start making others like ourselves.

20:18.929 --> 20:25.350
We like to make them suffer and torture them.

20:25.350 --> 20:31.470
That’s why I always say, “Poverty is leprosy.”

20:31.470 --> 20:36.059
Anybody who is in poverty can develop horrible
things within themselves.

20:36.059 --> 20:45.780
It is never to be sided with, not to be sympathized
but to be completely eradicated.

20:45.780 --> 20:53.000
Another side is the ego where we try to dominate
others and enjoy that.

20:53.000 --> 20:58.649
There’s no joy, there’s no joy in dominating
others and saying things to others.

20:58.649 --> 21:03.429
I was sorry to hear yesterday that there are
some girls who are married, some Indian girls

21:03.429 --> 21:09.350
who are married and their husbands are not
respecting them and troubling them.

21:09.350 --> 21:11.990
It hurt Me very much.

21:11.990 --> 21:17.260
That shows they’re so low level people,
very low level.

21:17.260 --> 21:18.389
Such a mediocracy, such useless people.

21:18.389 --> 21:23.590
They should have never come to Sahaja Yoga
and deceived us like this.

21:23.590 --> 21:32.769
They will go to hell direct, I can tell you
this.

21:32.769 --> 21:39.769
Now there are some who are caught up with
their superego; they suffer from some sort

21:39.769 --> 21:46.059
of a funny Sahaja Yoga schizophrenia.

21:46.059 --> 21:53.450
And they don’t want to get rid or it.

21:53.450 --> 21:58.470
They just don’t want to understand that
they’re not normal people, they have to

21:58.470 --> 22:02.160
be perfectly all right.

22:02.160 --> 22:12.299
They make everyone miserable, jump on to all
the places where they should not be.

22:12.299 --> 22:18.710
Like a person who has got, say, example, tuberculosis,
a disease which is contagious.

22:18.710 --> 22:28.570
Must understand he has got tuberculosis, keep
out, don’t give it to others, at least.

22:28.570 --> 22:37.000
But those who have got badhas will definitely
come, either they’ll give big lectures.

22:37.000 --> 22:47.410
I start seeing them like big bhoots speaking,
or if not they have badhas then they will

22:47.410 --> 22:49.990
come at a place where they should not be.

22:49.990 --> 22:54.340
They’ll put their hands in the prasada,
they’ll be sitting in the puja in the front,

22:54.340 --> 22:55.340
all kinds of things they’ll be doing, catching
people.

22:55.340 --> 23:04.669
And they enjoy it because they are identified
with the badhas.

23:04.669 --> 23:13.100
How will they improve?

23:13.100 --> 23:20.120
There’s one fellow who is a bhootish fellow,
we have had him for, I think, for at least

23:20.120 --> 23:29.730
for a century I should say, and he’s giving
lectures to others, “You must clean the

23:29.730 --> 23:34.610
shoes of all the Sahaja Yogis to get rid of
your ego.”

23:34.610 --> 23:46.029
So such a gross, depraved and low level people
are still in Sahaja Yoga.

23:46.029 --> 23:50.639
So the enjoyment of Sahaja Yoga becomes less.

23:50.639 --> 23:53.990
If you eat rice with stones in it, how will
you enjoy it?

23:53.990 --> 23:59.519
And that’s what it is.

23:59.519 --> 24:16.730
We are here to enjoy the blessings of God,
to have the mirth but still we are living

24:16.730 --> 24:23.760
with all joy-killing things that we have.

24:23.760 --> 24:30.610
How are we going to get rid of those things.

24:30.610 --> 24:39.190
So at least we do not become thorns in the
lives of others.

24:39.190 --> 24:45.309
So the so-called free will, I’m happy Rustom
has told you about it, is nothing but your

24:45.309 --> 24:50.139
ego and superego because you’re not in the
center.

24:50.139 --> 25:03.080
In the center, you have nothing but freedom,
that’s all, nothing but freedom; nothing

25:03.080 --> 25:08.450
like free will, freedom, complete freedom.

25:08.450 --> 25:24.980
There’s nothing like will or nothing like
bhoots, nothing like bondage, it’s entire

25:24.980 --> 25:29.779
avenue of freedom.

25:29.779 --> 25:44.450
Then this freedom is the knowledge, this freedom
is the love, this freedom is the discretion.

25:44.450 --> 25:57.140
Then you say God gives you freedom and others
freedom equally then you act which doesn’t

25:57.140 --> 26:07.929
bound you nor anybody else because it is knowledge,
it is discretion.

26:07.929 --> 26:16.080
Age does not matter, what age you are.

26:16.080 --> 26:26.600
I’ve seen some also very old people singing
beautifully and enjoying Sahaja Yoga and make

26:26.600 --> 26:29.149
Me enjoy also.

26:29.149 --> 26:34.980
Life is for us to enjoy, nothing else.

26:34.980 --> 26:38.279
But because we’re not free people, we cannot
enjoy.

26:38.279 --> 26:50.620
There is no bondage of any evil thought which
keeps you down.

26:50.620 --> 27:11.600
It is so subtle but penetrating into every
that is gross, that is Shri Krishna’s beautiful

27:11.600 --> 27:19.740
flute which creates a picture of the nature.

27:19.740 --> 27:28.460
The description , the
whole thing becomes silent like a picture.

27:28.460 --> 27:36.470
So this evening we’ll have the puja, we’ll
have all the enjoyment of Shri Krishna’s

27:36.470 --> 27:37.470
blessings upon us.

27:37.470 --> 27:54.760
There’s no end to the stories of Shri Krishna,
all full of mirth and play and innocence that

27:54.760 --> 27:57.850
kills rakshashas, devils.

27:57.850 --> 28:10.029
So today I’ve talked to you about His childhood,
and the puja I’ll tell you about Gita.

28:10.029 --> 28:11.869
May God bless you.
