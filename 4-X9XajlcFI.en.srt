1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


3
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


4
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000


5
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
1984-0708 Public Program 1 at Ilford Town Hall. Ilford (England), To Know The Truth

6
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,892
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

7
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:19,892
In the previous two lectures I told you how to understand the experience of truth.

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:28,892
In the first one, we came to the conclusion that if we have to feel the truth,

9
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:38,892
it’s not our only mental acceptance that it is truth, or our mental projection that it is truth,

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:48,892
but you have to feel it on your central nervous system.

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:01:02,892
In the second lecture I told you that when you feel the truth through your central nervous system

12
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:13,892
in your evolutionary process, then you become something.

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,892
You become, you become is the point. Is not that you think you are like this or like that,

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:37,892
but you really become something. Like a flower becomes a fruit or an egg becomes a chick.

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:47,892
You have to become something in your awareness, and this new awareness is the awareness of collective consciousness.

16
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:57,892
Where you can feel yourself, what’s the problem with you and you can feel others, on your fingertips.

17
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,892
This is a very good English idiom they use, on your fingertips.

18
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:07,892
I mean somebody must have thought of Sahaja Yoga when they formed this I am sure.

19
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,892
To use this, you should know it on your fingertips.

20
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,892
Now what does that mean? We have never thought of it, we always say so, we should know them on our fingertips,

21
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,892
but actually you feel them on your fingertips.

22
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:28,892
The different centres within you and the centres in other people.

23
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:39,892
As hot or cold, may be as heavy, burning; this you just feel it. You can feel it, others can feel it,

24
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:48,892
children can feel it and everybody feels the same, because truth is absolute and is for everyone.

25
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:56,892
Whether you have a different caste, community, race, religion, nationality,

26
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:03,892
all kinds of superficial things, which divides human beings, everyone feels the same.

27
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,892
For example, supposing you put a finger to this, (Candle flame) you are going to feel hot.

28
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,892
Because you have a different hair style, you are not going to feel something different,

29
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:23,892
it’s like that. Truth has to be that way, and that is what is the experience of truth.

30
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,892
And once you know you have to know the truth and nothing else but the truth.

31
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:38,892
When you decide in your mind and be honest about it then when you see it, it is very obvious.

32
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:46,892
It has to be obvious, it cannot be secretive. It cannot be, it has to be obvious, apparent,

33
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:51,892
absolutely known to your central nervous system.

34
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:59,892
So you know the absolute as I told you. Like a computer you start working, you ask any questions,

35
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:08,892
absolute questions and the answers come to you, as cool vibrations for yes and as hot vibrations for no

36
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,892
and sometimes the vibrations stops to say that absolutely no.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:22,892
But it can be some blister sometimes a little bit, to say that it’s satanic.

38
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,892
And you can decode it yourself and see for yourself.

39
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:38,892
This is the second phase where you start knowing about others and knowing about yourself.

40
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:47,892
So you become connected with the Absolute. Absolute, means there is no question about it,

41
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:59,892
absolute means there is no doubt about it, absolute means it is single.

42
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:09,892
Today I have to tell you about what actually happens when this force called Kundalini within you

43
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:20,892
rises and gives you self-realization. Actually within your self what should happen?

44
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:29,892
Nobody tells you these things, I mean, they’ll say you are to be reborn, so you have a sort of a certificate,

45
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:38,892
twice born, reborn and you go about, when it’s not like that.

46
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:48,892
Supposing a monkey puts a sign-board on, “I am a human being”, does he become?

47
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,892
If we just say we are this, we are that, you are not.

48
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:59,892
For example we say we are Muslims, we are Christians, we are Hindus, we are not.

49
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:06,892
Because you have formed a group, you call yourself something, or something that you are not.

50
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:13,892
It’s just your own idea. How are you a Hindu? How are you a Christian?

51
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,892
What all these religions have said that you have to be born again.

52
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:28,892
Every religion, Jews have in a way said it too,

53
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:40,892
but the problem is that we don’t do what is told to us, we just form a group.

54
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:45,892
Group can be made out of anything nonsensical like, I met some other people the other day

55
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,892
and they told Me our group is called as Knives and Fork.

56
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,892
I said “What’s that group?” Knives and Forks, yes very good group,

57
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:02,892
so I said, “What is that?” “Because we put our knives and forks in a different way than others.”

58
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:09,892
I said ” But what’s the use?” “No, we form a very strong group.” “For what?”

59
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,892
“We can form a political party tomorrow.”

60
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,892
I said, “All right, go ahead with this kind of a nonsense”,

61
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:24,892
But it is nonsense, all this is nonsense. What is sensible is that

62
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,892
we have to become something more than what we are. We are human beings,

63
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,892
we have to become more knowledgeable, we have to become the knowledge.

64
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:39,892
That knowledge you cannot get in the libraries or from the books.

65
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,892
How do you grow into that knowledge is through this Kundalini awakening,

66
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:49,892
through this happening that, this Kundalini rises within you

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:57,892
and pierces through your fontanel bone area giving you the real baptism and not the artificial one.

68
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:05,892
The reality again. Supposing somebody doesn’t get it, all right, so he comes back on Me,

69
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:13,892
“Oh I never got it Mother”. Something wrong, he should get it, should get it.

70
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:22,892
Because we cannot give you a false certificate, you cannot give yourself a false certificate.

71
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:31,892
But it is very common as you see in this world, that when you listen to people who are religious,

72
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:39,892
you find they are horribly fanatic, funny, stupid people.

73
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,892
I mean if you want to hear about each one of them you should go to the opposite party.

74
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,892
Like if you want to hear about Hindus go to Muslims.

75
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,892
If you want to hear about the Muslims go to Jews and

76
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:04,892
if you want to hear about Jews go to say Muslims or anyone, Christians, and they’ll tell you.

77
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,892
So there’s nothing universal opinion about things.

78
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,892
It is surprising for a person who wants to see the truth in every religion,

79
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:21,892
he cannot understand why people belonging to religion, when God is only one,

80
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:31,892
why there’s a fight going on. Why this world is divided by, even religious leaders are dividing the world.

81
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:42,892
It is very amazing. So where is this religion? And what happens to our religion?

82
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:54,892
When we get our self-realization, we become the Self, the Spirit and the Spirit is untarnishable.

83
00:09:55,000 --> 00:10:03,892
It’s untarnishable. You cannot cleanse the soap, can you?

84
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:07,892
But the quality of Spirit is that it cleanses you. First is it cleanses you.

85
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:15,892
Just like a Mother lovingly cleanses the child who has fallen somewhere in the road

86
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:22,892
and cleanses the clothes and makes the child absolutely neat, tidy, clean

87
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,892
and with great admiration looks at the child;

88
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:35,892
in the same way the Spirit bathes you with it’s beautiful blessings so that you cleanse.

89
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,892
And the second thing it does is to give you light.

90
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:48,892
Now the light doesn’t mean electrical light, it doesn’t mean the light you see inside.

91
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:53,892
What does this light means is your awareness itself.

92
00:10:54,000 --> 00:11:04,892
Your awareness itself becomes a higher awareness by which you start seeing things clear cut.

93
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:12,892
Like I know somebody who came to see Me before Sahaja Yoga

94
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:19,892
and he met Me after say a month, he was a changed man, I could not recognize him.

95
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,892
So I said what has happened to him? He came to Me I asked him,

96
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:29,892
”How are you?” He said “Mother I am fine.”

97
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:38,892
He used to look very old and haggard and absolutely frustrated. I said “What has happened?”

98
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:47,892
He said “Mother you know, when I got realisation, suddenly I felt tremendous compassion for everyone

99
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:55,892
and I had an enemy that was my uncle and I hated him from the bottom of my heart,

100
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:02,892
and I used to think he has killed my mother, and I could not believe that he has not killed my mother,

101
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:05,892
so many people told me but still with the hatred I could not get over it.

102
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,892
I had insulted him, he had insulted me and if somebody had given me freedom with

103
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:16,892
a dagger I would have gone and killed him. I hated him from the bottom of my heart.

104
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,892
And all the time I thought of killing him, doing this and all the nasty things I could think of.

105
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:29,892
My whole mind was pre-occupied.” “So what happened?” He said,

106
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,892
“Next day I started seeing his good points, I said no he is a very generous man.

107
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:43,892
I have been nastier that he has been, suddenly I started feeling it, that feeling of love,

108
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:49,892
compassion and when I said uncle, I forgive you completely,

109
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:55,892
the blissfulness crawled upon me, that’s the first time I’ve felt the joy of my spirit.

110
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:59,892
I had said this before also but I had never felt it,

111
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:06,892
but first time when I said this I felt it and that bliss was so great and that joy was so great

112
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,892
I said now I must have it at any cost.

113
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:16,892
So next day I saw him at a race, he was a great race goer also, a very rich man.

114
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:25,892
I saw him and I just embraced him. I couldn’t help it. He was surprised, he looked at me,

115
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,892
he said come and have tea with me, and we are great friends now.”

116
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:36,892
So all that wrinkle, all that horrible anger and all that has gone away

117
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,892
and this divine, serene face was showing its beauty there.

118
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:48,892
But he said “I have done this before, I’ve tried to forgive him, I told myself,

119
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:53,892
I told many a times that he’s not killed my mother, I should not hate him.

120
00:13:54,000 --> 00:14:00,892
I tried to convince myself, but still I could not forgive, I didn’t have the power to forgive.

121
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:05,892
But when I got my self-realization, suddenly the power came to me,

122
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,892
in such a gush. I have become powerful Mother.”

123
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,892
In the Sanskrit language it’s called the word Samarth,

124
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:22,892
Samarth means powerful but actually means Sama-Artha, it means equal to your meaning.

125
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:28,892
Equal to your meaning, means you become your Self. Samartha.

126
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,892
When you become yourself, you become powerful to fight your weaknesses

127
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:48,892
and you automatically do it without any trouble, spontaneously. Very easy it is to forgive.

128
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:56,892
Not only this, so many things there are which you just do without any difficulty.

129
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:07,892
It is very difficult before realization for a person to think that to part with your little bit of two P’s that you have,

130
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,892
even that is sometimes difficult. You think ten times, calculate it, all right,

131
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,892
if I give two P’s now how much will I get, three P’s or five P’s, all right

132
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:29,892
if I get three P’s no good, five P’s is all right; but after realization you just give.

133
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:36,892
You just give, you like to give, you love to give, you want to enjoy the giving capacity of yourself.

134
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:41,892
So far the acquiring, acquisition and also the capacity to preserve,

135
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,892
keep everything to yourself becomes a giving capacity.

136
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:53,892
And as a result of that, what you find, you are filled in.

137
00:15:54,000 --> 00:16:07,892
Every sort of thing, every sort of material or physical or anything that is needed to make you happy

138
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,892
just comes down. From where, how, God alone knows because it’s only God does the job,

139
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:26,892
it’s God’s work. So the power to stand up against evil, against injustice,

140
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:35,892
against wrong doing just changes your priorities completely

141
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:44,892
and you become a powerful personality. Like Christ when He saw the prostitute,

142
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:52,892
Mary Magdalene, being stoned, He saw the disciple Mary Magdalene in her.

143
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:58,892
He stood up and He said, “Those who have not sinned can throw stones at Me.”

144
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:04,892
That character, that strength that stood up there,

145
00:17:05,000 --> 00:17:11,892
and nobody could even think of throwing stones at Him.

146
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:19,892
This powerful personality which is compassion, which is righteous, which is virtuous,

147
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:30,892
starts shining through you. It’s not a quarrelsome dominating power in which we believe.

148
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:38,892
According to us a powerful man is the one who can dominate the whole world.

149
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,892
The power of love we have never exploited, never.

150
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:51,892
All our enterprises, all our worldly affairs, political, economic, are based on hatred.

151
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:58,892
The power of love in it’s purest from is the most powerful thing

152
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,892
and that is going to emancipate the whole universe. There’s no other way out.

153
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:11,892
It doesn’t mean your carnal love or your nonsensical ideas of love, it’s not, it’s pure love.

154
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,892
The pure love is that kind where the sap rises in a tree

155
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:25,892
and gives nourishment to all the parts of the tree and goes back. It’s not attached.

156
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:31,892
If it gets attached to one flower, the tree will die, the flower will die.

157
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:39,892
So this is the power which empowers you, nourishes you, soothes you,

158
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:50,892
consoles you, relaxes you and leaves you powerful.

159
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,892
That sort of a power is to be felt if it is the experience of truth.

160
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:05,892
But we have never tried to understand love in its own truth.

161
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:13,892
The reason is we were not realized people. When we are blind, we are mixed up.

162
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,892
We can’t make out one from another but when our eyes are opened out

163
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:27,892
we understand the true love. And this is what people have exploited, many of them,

164
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:32,892
many so called gurus and these people who talk of God have exploited

165
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:40,892
this side of love by teaching dirty things to people, debasing them, using their weaknesses.

166
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:48,892
Saying that if you do this kind of a weakness, then you will reach God.

167
00:19:49,000 --> 00:20:02,892
Love that makes you a slave cannot be love and that is what it is, the love that is divine,

168
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:10,892
is the love of God that starts flowing through you, you become the medium, as you call it,

169
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:17,892
of that love. A powerful medium. But you know how to manoeuvre it.

170
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:26,892
You know everything. It’s not blindly, I have seen some people, oh we are in love, you see going on like that, no.

171
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:36,892
You know everyone. You know ins and outs of everyone and of yourself also.

172
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:42,892
I have seen many people coming to Me and saying, “Mother please save me from this Agnya.”

173
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:48,892
Now in our language it is this Agnya, but actually it means ego.

174
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:54,892
You can see your ego clearly once you get realization and we say oh God what is this?

175
00:20:55,000 --> 00:21:01,892
That’s not me, I am not ego, oh that’s not me, I am the Self, I am the Spirit.

176
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:09,892
So this separation takes place within yourself, with your own understanding that,

177
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:20,892
you are not this body, this mind, this ego, this superego but you are the spirit.

178
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:30,892
And the more you grow into it, a beautiful personality of a character, which is not a character,

179
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:34,892
sometimes people think if you are very meek, is he compromising,

180
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:39,892
such a character will never compromise, is a terrific character.

181
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:47,892
It would never compromise with anything that is not the truth. It cannot by temperament.

182
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,892
But is very kind and compassionate, forgiving.

183
00:21:53,000 --> 00:22:01,892
Gives lots of chances because there’s that inner urge to save others, to save others,

184
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,892
to help others, to get them to the right thing.

185
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:09,892
It’s like people who are standing on the brink of a disaster,

186
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,892
or people who are on the bank and see the people getting drowned and trying to pull them out

187
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:24,892
with all their effort. But they don’t want to compromise as to jump or to leave the banks that they have got.

188
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:32,892
Such a character you develop then and this character is felt by everyone.

189
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,892
I have known many Sahaja Yogis first who came to Sahaja Yoga,

190
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:45,892
their own family people were angry. Now you are following another Guru,

191
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:54,892
this is another cult, this is that. But then they found out that they are giving no money, nothing,

192
00:22:55,000 --> 00:23:03,892
and they are flowering. In every way they are beautiful, they are becoming better and better people.

193
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:10,892
Righteous and virtuous people, powerful people of great character

194
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:15,892
and they are amazed you know. How do they become?

195
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:23,892
And they become very intelligent, they don’t do any stupid things, they just don’t do it.

196
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:29,892
Even a little child knows it’s stupid. They don’t do stupid things.

197
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:39,892
They don’t do nonsensical things. They are dignified and they don’t take to cheap entertainments.

198
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:49,892
The depth that you feel in the poets, in the great musicians, becomes their own nature.

199
00:23:50,000 --> 00:24:02,892
When they talk, when they walk, any rapport with them, you can feel the depth of their spirit.

200
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:08,892
They become very knowledgeable suddenly. As I told you last time these journalists asked Me

201
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,892
“Mother have you got all scholars?” I said “Scholars, what.”

202
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:17,892
“All scholars are Sahaja Yogis,” I said “No, at the most one percent may be,

203
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:24,892
who have been great headaches to me, the rest of them are simple people.”

204
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:32,892
Simple people are the best and this is what is true,

205
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:42,892
that those who get realization start feeling the knowledge which is absolute.

206
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:46,892
Seeing the knowledge, knowing the knowledge.

207
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:55,892
Like if you see, say, this pillar, you just look at it, you say, oh very nicely done painted this,

208
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:59,892
somebody might say it should not have been this color, that color.

209
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:06,892
But a Sahaja Yogi doesn’t see this pillar as to how aesthetically it is and all that,

210
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:15,892
but immediately he’ll say it’s beautiful. You’ll say why? It gives vibrations.

211
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:20,892
The whole aesthetics are worked out through vibrations.

212
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:29,892
All the beautiful things, as I told you last time, of the world have vibrations.

213
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:34,892
Real beautiful things have vibrations. Like Mona Lisa I told you the other day,

214
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,892
if you go and feel her vibrations, she has vibrations.

215
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:50,892
Now the one who has made her has put his joy into her and she emits vibrations.

216
00:25:51,000 --> 00:26:02,892
And that is the thing that gives joy to you because you are at a level where you can feel those vibrations.

217
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:12,892
You start feeling the physical side of yours, you understand you have a physical problem.

218
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,892
Immediately you know you have a physical problem, you know where it is,

219
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,892
how to correct it, how to cure it. I have seen many people who come to me,

220
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:26,892
Mother cure my cancer, but they don’t come to Me before they get cancer.

221
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:33,892
If they had come they would never have got it, but they had no time, at that time they had no time.

222
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:41,892
But when they get cancer I have no time either. It happens always.

223
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:51,892
Of course they are to be helped, cured, but why not come as a prevention to all those diseases

224
00:26:52,000 --> 00:27:10,892
which has no meaning. It is unnecessarily so much accepted that health is first of all.

225
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,892
Then there is nothing to worry about health if you come to Sahaja Yoga,

226
00:27:15,000 --> 00:27:19,892
you don’t need any doctor, sorry for the doctors, I am sorry.

227
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:25,892


228
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:33,892
And this is what it is to be understood that physically you feel absolutely fit.

229
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:40,892
You look fit absolutely. You look marvellous.

230
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:56,892
Then when you start expanding yourself you start feeling your own mind.

231
00:27:57,000 --> 00:28:00,892
The peace, the bliss of your own mind.

232
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:07,892
Many a times you’ll find there is no thought but the joy is just bursting in

233
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:15,892
and you just think why it has happened. Suddenly, how do I get this?

234
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:28,892
Gradually the state of joy starts increasing in its frequency and you become joy.

235
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:37,892
That is, one has to achieve, to become the joy is important.

236
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:44,892
And once you become that joy it’s not a duality, it’s not a duality.

237
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:52,892
It’s not a thing in which you feel the happiness and unhappiness but you feel the joy.

238
00:28:53,000 --> 00:29:03,892
Joy is a witness, it’s a kind of a power of a witness which sees a drama,

239
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:12,892
by seeing the drama, whether tragedy or comedy, it’s at a point where it is just a witness and enjoying it.

240
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:17,892
In the same way you’ll see so called comedies and tragedies of your life

241
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:24,892
and the futility of your nonsensical endeavours and you’ll laugh at it, oh that’s it, that’s me.

242
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:32,892
For example in Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare has tried to show the futility of all those egos.

243
00:29:33,000 --> 00:29:39,892
According to Indian standards he was Avadhotta, as they call it, a person who was realised

244
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:46,892
and was a very evolved personality. And if you want to see how Romeo should get his realization

245
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:51,892
and how he should feel that after all that happened he should laugh loudly.

246
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:58,892
She gets realisation, oh what a fool a stupid thing I was.

247
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:06,892
Shakespeare did not show him getting realization he kept it for us Sahaja Yogis to see it,

248
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:12,892
but should have seen to it that Romeo laughs at himself and makes fun of himself,

249
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:19,892
oh stupid Mr. Romeo, now you better settle down.

250
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:26,892
But he showed and very cleverly if you see in all his Macbeth or any of his dramas

251
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:31,892
that he has tried to show the futility of our ego, our enterprises,

252
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:39,892
we think that is very important in life.

253
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,892
I would say there are so many great writers in English language,

254
00:30:43,000 --> 00:30:46,892
which I cannot name them in a series, but I have read them.

255
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:52,892
Somerset Maugham, I would say was another one. I was very much impressed by his writings

256
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,892
and read most of his novels because he was very much there.

257
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:06,892
Cronin for example is another one I would say who wrote Citadel was another great person who

258
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:16,892
could see the drama of stupidity. Leave alone your great poets like William Blake and all those.

259
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:26,892
But all that was to show that there is a higher being you see, which sees all this,

260
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:31,892
and giving you a drama of yourself, projecting it through you.

261
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:36,892
That this is what you are, you see, see yourself.

262
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:48,892
That’s what they did and despite everything we’re lost. We are lost quite a lot.

263
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:55,892
We have to become the same like Shakespeare to see the drama,

264
00:31:56,000 --> 00:32:00,892
like Somerset Maugham, we have to become the same.

265
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:03,892
To see the drama, we may not write a book, doesn’t matter,

266
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:10,892
but the capacity to see the drama, that’s what we develop.

267
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:17,892
We need not write, we may not have the flare of a pen to write but we see it the same way as they see it

268
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:24,892
and that’s the mental capacity to which we rise with self-realization.

269
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:29,892
I have seen very stupid people absolutely calling themselves gurus,

270
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,892
you look at them and you don’t know what to say, you see.

271
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:40,892
You have to look at stupider persons to stupider, that person, what you say, stupidest person,

272
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:45,892
in the presence of such a person, because he looks at you, you see,

273
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:49,892
and you understand he is stupid and you don’t know what to do.

274
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:56,892
And you get frightened of such a person you know and you don’t want to hurt his feelings you see,

275
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:02,892
so you look the greater stupid person and then he gives you a big lecture,

276
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:09,892
on something very stupid. But then you find that person you see,

277
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:16,892
big newspapers you see like Times, publishing such a stupid man there.

278
00:33:17,000 --> 00:33:23,892
Just imagine, this is what we have done to Shakespeare, to all our great writers and everyone,

279
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:29,892
we have reached that state that we cannot even see the stupidity.

280
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,892


281
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:43,892
Our brain is stunned because we have been asking for sensations,

282
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:49,892
with all these electrical sensations in the brain we are stunned.

283
00:33:50,000 --> 00:34:01,892
Which opens out, which completely opens out and you start seeing, through and through,

284
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:10,892
the mockery of all this kind of seriousness and the hypocrisy

285
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:19,892
and the way people who are stupid try to give you stupid ideas.

286
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:22,892
And once you are realised you laugh at yourself,

287
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:29,892
oh God I was so stupid, that’s what should happen.

288
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:39,892
If that does not happen your self-realization has no meaning, it has no meaning.

289
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:46,892
The righteousness and the virtues become part and parcel of your being.

290
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:50,892
It’s not that you have to be told anything, you just shouldn’t do it.

291
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:58,892
It’s beyond your self respect because you respect your Self, you respect your Spirit.

292
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:06,892
How can you do such a thing? You cannot despise yourself can you?

293
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:12,892
You just become virtuous. You may be kind to others even if they are not virtuous,

294
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:18,892
you can be nice to them, you can forgive them but as far as you are concerned there is no compromise.

295
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:26,892
And you enjoy your virtues, you enjoy your magnanimity, you enjoy your generosity.

296
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:30,892
People will tell you, stupid fool, you go on distributing things what are you doing?

297
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:40,892
And you laugh at them. As Lao Tse said, somebody told Me this saying about Lao Tse,

298
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:46,892
another great incarnation of the primordial master,

299
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:54,892
that when a wise sees the way, he respects it and says this is the way.

300
00:35:55,000 --> 00:36:03,892
That’s the sign of a wise man and a mediocre who is half way this way and that way

301
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:10,892
when he sees the way he waits for others to go into it,

302
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:17,892
and when the stupid sees the way he laughs.

303
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:26,892
But when the wise sees the stupid in himself he laughs.

304
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:41,892
So that power of wisdom starts shinning through you, you become a wise, righteous, virtuous man.

305
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:48,892
And such a balance you develop. I have known people who are honest, you see, so called,

306
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:54,892
now they go to such an extreme of honesty, that for honesty’s sake they’ll kill their father,

307
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,892
kill their mother, kill everyone.

308
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:03,892
But such a balanced and integrated person you become

309
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:12,892
that whatever you do is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others.

310
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,892
In Sanskrit the word is Haitha [BEST GUESS],

311
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:22,892
what ever is good for your spirit and for the spirit of others you do it.

312
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:31,892
And that is the right thing to do, and that’s how you become a righteous personality.

313
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:39,892
That’s the religion within you that gets awakened. Nobody has to tell you your religion,

314
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:46,892
you yourself become your own master, your own Guru, and by which you determine yourself,

315
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:58,892
now Mr. you can’t do this. No you can’t. So you become your own police commissioner.

316
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:02,892
You don’t need any outsider to tell you.

317
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:08,892
You are on your own guard because if you do something like that your vibrations will disappear

318
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:15,892
and then you don’t like it, don’t like it. Then you feel uneasy.

319
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:24,892
Nobody has to have you as a Guru, there’s no need you become your own Guru, is the best way.

320
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:37,892
And that’s how you solve the problem of becoming better by others,

321
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:49,892
is very difficult but yourself becoming better, by your own understanding and urges,

322
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:59,892
it’s a thousand fold happier and strong.

323
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:12,892
So the third thing that happens to you, that you become religious, you become the Guru, yourself.

324
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:18,892
Nobody has to tell you because there is a natural valency of ten within you

325
00:39:19,000 --> 00:39:24,892
which starts balancing you, and you become one and enjoy that balance.

326
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:29,892
As you enjoy a balance of colors in a beautiful photograph,

327
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:33,892
in the same way you enjoy the balance within yourself. You enjoy your personality,

328
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:40,892
you enjoy your being and you enjoy to be the Self.

329
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:45,892
And those who are on the same level, you just enjoy each other.

330
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:54,892
This is the first time you enjoy other human being, as if you are enjoying a flower.

331
00:39:55,000 --> 00:40:05,892
The fragrance of that personality is spiritual fragrance, is so beautiful and attractive.

332
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:17,892
Without any lust and greed in it but just enjoying the company is real perfect bliss.

333
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:21,892
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

334
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,892
Now, again today, I would like you to ask Me some questions.

335
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,892
There is going to be the fourth lecture, that they will announce.

336
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:41,892
I hope you will make it a point to come and complete the series of lectures we have been having.

337
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:53,892


338
00:40:54,000 --> 00:41:09,892
Q1. [INAUDIBLE]

339
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,892
A1. It’s true. It has been told that you must have a Guru.

340
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:22,892
But it’s said that it has to be a Satguru. Anybody you see, mostly,

341
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:28,892
the gurus who are in the market today. You cannot be in the market,

342
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:37,892
and those who are in the market are actually, are nowhere near God.

343
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:43,892
They have to be Satguru, means he has to be a realized soul of a very high degree.

344
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:47,892


345
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:54,892
Now you better become your own Guru. And then you will know that you are a Satguru.

346
00:41:55,000 --> 00:42:01,892
I am the Mother, I am not a Guru. And what is Mother’s desire is? You had a mother also.

347
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:07,892
Whatever I have, you better have it. That’s all.

348
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:16,892
So as you have come to Mother, now you don’t ask for any guru, you better become yourself a Guru. All right?

349
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:26,892
Q2. [INAUDIBLE]

350
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:34,892
A2. No. You see, you must know that the Kundalini awakening itself, breaking through and all that,

351
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:40,892
is a big happening. A key event of evolution, the epitome of it, as you know,

352
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:48,892
as an Indian you know how Sakshatkar is such a big thing. But to achieve that,

353
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:53,892
there must be a big machinery within us. Like you see the electrical bulb here, or a light here,

354
00:42:54,000 --> 00:43:02,892
you know there is a history behind it, and it is a big mechanism and organization that has worked it out.

355
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,892
In the same way to achieve this there’s a big organization.

356
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:17,892
So, when you become realized, that will happen very soon to you.

357
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,892
Means you’ll feel the cool breeze coming out of the Brahmarandra, through your fontanel bone area.

358
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:28,892
But then to develop it, you have to understand, deeper, the mechanism.

359
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:38,892
Then the mantras are placed according to the deities of these seven chakras.

360
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:48,892
Now if the Kundalini is stopping, or is weak at a point, any one of these chakras,

361
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,892
then you have to say a particular mantra for that. Which will be told to you,

362
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,892
which you can learn very easily. And you will know also about all the mantras that are to be said.

363
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:05,892
Like, you see, many gurus I have seen give away one mantra. Like they say Ram.

364
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:13,892
How can that be? You see, there are seven chakras, and if you take Ram,

365
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,892
he’s on the right side of the heart chakra, means [UNKNOWN SANSKRIT WORD].

366
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,892
Now, if you are taking the name of Rama, why, why Rama’s name?

367
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:28,892
Ask a question to him, you must ask a question. Why Rama’s name, why not Krishna’s?

368
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:34,892
Why not Jesus? The reason is, if he’s a Satguru he’ll tell you,

369
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:42,892
that you have a problem with your right heart. But all of them here, those who are realization souls,

370
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,892
can tell you where is the problem. And you will also tell tomorrow.

371
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,892
Q3. [INAUDIBLE]

372
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:55,892
A3. No, it’s not. There are seven mantras actually. Basically you must know about seven mantras.

373
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,892
But gradually, you pick it up in no time, because immediately you know where the problem is,

374
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:03,892
and immediately you say the mantra. It’s not very difficult, it’s very simple.

375
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:07,892
It is woven in a pattern and it’s very simple to say those mantras.

376
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:13,892
But it works out so spontaneously, I mean, these are all people who are English

377
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:20,892
and Greeks and this and that, and they don’t know. Even, we can say mantras in English language now.

378
00:45:21,000 --> 00:45:31,892
That’s an advancement I think. That all the deities can understand English language as well.

379
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:37,892
So you can say it in Sanskrit or in English, it’s all right, it works out.

380
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:43,892
And, once you know it, it’s so easy to say it, easy to understand. It’s not a problem at all.

381
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:47,892
But first of all you should get your realization, that’s first thing.

382
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:53,892
That is you should break through, you see, the seed must break. [INAUDIBLE], its primule must break.

383
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:58,892
Then the second thing is to see that it sustains itself above the ground.

384
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:04,892
Then it is to be maintained and developed until you become a tree.

385
00:46:05,000 --> 00:46:08,892
But it’s very simple, it’s not difficult.

386
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,892
Q4. [INAUDIBLE]

387
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:17,892
A4. When you get your realization you start feeling the cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area

388
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,892
and you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands. Then you can ask a question,

389
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:27,892
is this the breeze of the Adi Shakti? Is this the Chaitanya Lahari of the Adi Shakti?

390
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:32,892
Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost? The Holy Ghost is Adi Shakti actually.

391
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:38,892
Nobody has explained to them, they don’t know. I mean, they asked the Archbishop of Canterbury

392
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:42,892
about Holy Ghost, he said “I’m agnostic,” can you imagine?

393
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:47,892
Yes, he answered. I mean, if he’s agnostic this Robin Day asked him

394
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,892
“So what are you doing here?” So he said “I’m doing my job.” So Robin Day said

395
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:59,892
“Yes” because he also does the job. He understood it. [HINDI].

396
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:04,892
Now the problem is that when you start feeling the cool breeze in your hands,

397
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:08,892
you might find that after some time it goes away then comes. See, depends on.

398
00:47:09,000 --> 00:47:13,892
Some people have a express train, as we call it.

399
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:19,892
But some of them have some bogeys, which go up and down. It doesn’t matter.

400
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:27,892
We should not frustrate on that point, it works out. One should not get unhappy about it.

401
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:41,892
Q5. [INAUDIBLE]

402
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:51,892
A5. Subconscious. Of course, I mean the same. I am the Self, I am the Spirit, yes.

403
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:59,892
Like, I’ll tell you, in the bible, Christ clearly said it, very clearly, we don’t read bible that way,

404
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:05,892
that’s why. That Nicodemus, you see, He told Nicodemus that you are to be born again.

405
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:11,892
So, Nicodemus said that does that mean that I should enter into the womb of my mother.

406
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:19,892
He said no, that is flesh, and the flesh is born out of, whatever is born out of flesh is flesh.

407
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:27,892
You are to be born of your Spirit. And whatever is born of the Spirit is the Spirit He said.

408
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:39,892
But how many people follow that? That’s the consciousness I’m talking of, the real Selfhood.

409
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:48,892
What we do, in the churches, or in our Indian, any one of the religions that we have.

410
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:52,892
We put the water on the head, now you are baptized, you are a Christian.

411
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:57,892
For a Hindu they put a string, now you are a Brahmin, without knowing a word about Brahma.

412
00:48:58,000 --> 00:49:04,892
[INAUDIBLE]. So now, there is reality.

413
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:10,892
All these people didn’t tell us lies you see, never told us lies.

414
00:49:11,000 --> 00:49:17,892
But the truth is always covered by the intellectuals, by the intelligent people on one side

415
00:49:18,000 --> 00:49:22,892
and by the fanatics on the other side, and that’s why the problem comes in.

416
00:49:23,000 --> 00:49:34,892
Q6. [INAUDIBLE]

417
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:39,892
A6. You see, because, what happens that intellectuals rationalize it.

418
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:43,892
They say whatever we see, we see the science, so we don’t want to believe.

419
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,892
Now recently there has been a controversy about Christ miracles, isn’t it.

420
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:58,892
There, lets take this thing very recently, there’s a controversy about Christ’s being born of a virgin.

421
00:49:59,000 --> 00:50:04,892
He was born of a virgin, no doubt, but how can you convince an intellectual you see,

422
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:09,892
because He cannot be born of a virgin. But He was born.

423
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,892
All these miracles are absolute truth, no doubt.

424
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:16,892
So the problem is they want to see through science. Now science is analytical,

425
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:23,892
it is not does the synthesis. Science deals with the dead.

426
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,892
It deadens everything, it analyzes, and whatever you see you think it’s the truth, no,

427
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:33,892
but it’s just a part of the truth. Now why do they accept?

428
00:50:34,000 --> 00:50:40,892
See now, big challenge, is intellectual. This was Mr Paul, who came in.

429
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:45,892
When I was a child I asked My father, who is this Paul?

430
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:52,892
My father, being a very great realized soul himself, he said, he was another mad man.

431
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,892
And this Paul had never seen Christ. What we call, he had a supraconscious,

432
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,892
a kind of a [CONDITION or POSITION?], he got blind and all that.

433
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,892
And then he became, he was a horrible man, he killed so many Jews,

434
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,892
he killed the young boys for [STEALING?] you know he did all sorts of things and then suddenly,

435
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:16,892
he becomes a big Christian. Because he saw some sort of a political thing in that.

436
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:21,892
So what does he say, he doesn’t talk of Christ as He was, he talks of a Christ

437
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:26,892
which was the church Christ, the Christ of the church.

438
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:32,892
Now, Christ of the church has nothing to do with real Christ, has nothing to do.

439
00:51:33,000 --> 00:51:37,892
So now, because they have to accept, the churches have to accept Paul,

440
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:43,892
they cannot accept Christ. It’s a good idea. Either accept Christ, or accept,

441
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:47,892
this is what happens with intellectuals. Even in India it has happened.

442
00:51:48,000 --> 00:51:54,892
I’ll tell you when, when Adi Shankaracharya, he wrote a book called Viviketurya.

443
00:51:55,000 --> 00:52:00,892
It’s a great treatise. About Athvaida [BEST GUESS] he said that God is everything,

444
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:08,892
Brahma is everything. A beautiful treatise he wrote. So there was a fellow called Vishra,

445
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:13,892
Mandan Vishra [BEST GUESS], is a great learned man, another intellectual,

446
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,892
he came to argue with him. And he argued and argued and argued,

447
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:20,892
you see with argument where do you reach? You cannot by arguing give realization to somebody.

448
00:52:21,000 --> 00:52:26,892
And he said, “Why don’t you take your realization?” But he argued,

449
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,892
he said “You defeat me.” He said “I don’t want to defeat you I want to give you realization,

450
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:35,892
why don’t you take your realization?” He would not take the realization.

451
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:43,892
So, the intellectual, you see, tortured his life. He was so fed up, Adi Shankaracharya.

452
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:47,892
The book he wrote was Saundarya Lahiri, if you ever happen to read it,

453
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:53,892
it’s nothing but the praise of the Mother, throughout. He said this is how [SANSKRIT]

454
00:52:54,000 --> 00:52:56,892
not by yoga by Sankara [BEST GUESS] by discussion, it’s only through Mother’s grace

455
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:02,892
you are going to get realization [INAUDIBLE].

456
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:09,892
So the intellectuals, you see, want to derive a pleasure of an intellectual feat out of most if it.

457
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:18,892
It’s not the real that they are seeking. They read, a lot, achieve nothing.

458
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,892
I have known people who are very learned, who have written many books

459
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:30,892
and they are so horribly immoral within their private life you can’t believe it that they could be philosophers.

460
00:53:31,000 --> 00:53:36,892
And you don’t understand, how can you be, why are you so hypocritical? But they are.

461
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:42,892
Because they are not realized souls. And an ordinary person, you find a realized soul.

462
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:50,892
Just uneducated. That’s why Kabira has said Pari Pari Pundita Mura Kabai,

463
00:53:51,000 --> 00:54:00,892
by reading too much you learned have become stupid. But I don’t say all learned are stupid.

464
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:08,892
No. But learning should reach that supreme power of intelligence, which is pure intelligence.

465
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:13,892
Then obviously you see the thing and you accept if you are honest as I said in the beginning.

466
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,892
You must have that pure intelligence to see, God is there.

467
00:54:19,000 --> 00:54:23,892
He’s above everything, he’s above your intelligence, above your thoughts.

468
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:29,892
You have to feel him first, you have to rise. That is the transformation, if you cannot achieve,

469
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:37,892
then how can I talk to you? If a person is blind,

470
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:44,892
what’s the use of talking about colors to a blind person, what does he understand?

471
00:54:45,000 --> 00:54:50,892
He can’t even see whether I’m smiling or laughing or if I’m crying. What can you talk?

472
00:54:51,000 --> 00:54:58,892
So the eyes must be open, and these eyes which I’m talking of are above your thought.

473
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:02,892
You cannot by your projection get it.

474
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:11,892
It has to come to you. It’s a grace. Ashedvard [BEST GUESS].

475
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:19,892
Q7. [INAUDIBLE]

476
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:25,892
A7. No You see what I would suggest that what happens that once you get your realisation

477
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:31,892
then I have seen a person who has developed the intellect,

478
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:37,892
understands it in an intellectual way what realization is

479
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:45,892
and a person who is not supposed to be so intelligent starts talking like saints.

480
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:51,892
I had gone to a village in India and there was a person who was, I was going on a bullock cart,

481
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,892
he was driving Me and I asked him when he did you get your realization

482
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,892
and then he started talking to Me. I said “Kabira is driving Me or what?”

483
00:56:01,000 --> 00:56:08,892
How is he talking like this?” The truth, tremendous, what intelligence.

484
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:15,892
How much Christ studied in what university?

485
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:23,892
So we should not misunderstand intelligence I mean the divine intelligence,

486
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,892
that’s a very different thing.

487
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:43,012
Q8. [INAUDIBLE]

488
00:56:43,072 --> 00:56:49,964
A8. You are, all the time, if you, Shaktipad [BEST GUESS] is the word they use it,

489
00:56:50,072 --> 00:56:55,964
Shaktipad you see, but it is very much misused. Shaktipad means people start dancing like mad,

490
00:56:56,072 --> 00:57:00,964
they start shouting screaming how can that be Shaktipad? That’s madness, that’s possession,

491
00:57:01,072 --> 00:57:08,964
you get possessed. Shaktipad means if somebody is a Shakti,

492
00:57:09,072 --> 00:57:13,964
you see the Shakti of that person enters into your being and invites your Kundalini

493
00:57:14,072 --> 00:57:16,964
so the Kundalini rises. That’s what actually it is

494
00:57:17,072 --> 00:57:21,964
and then the Kundalini rises and makes you a beautiful person

495
00:57:22,072 --> 00:57:25,964
it doesn’t make you a mad person no how can it be?

496
00:57:26,072 --> 00:57:30,964
Just imagine now after evolving yourself from amoeba and all the donkeys

497
00:57:31,072 --> 00:57:39,964
and all the monkeys and what else, oh, cockroaches are you going to become a mad person?

498
00:57:40,072 --> 00:57:44,964
Or a frog, jumping like that.

499
00:57:45,072 --> 00:57:49,964
So this is very much, that’s why I don’t use very much Shaktipad power because these days

500
00:57:50,072 --> 00:57:56,964
every Dick, Tom and Harry is using you see. Shaktipad that’s not what I mean.

501
00:57:57,072 --> 00:57:59,964
Shaktipad means if somebody has Shakti it just works.

502
00:58:00,072 --> 00:58:05,964
You don’t go and put it in the head of that person, it just flows, all right?

503
00:58:06,072 --> 00:58:12,964
But it was used in Patanjali’s day in that way but who reads Patanjali? Nobody reads I think

504
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:17,964
nobody reads and talks about it. What they talk is some sort of a head standing

505
00:58:18,072 --> 00:58:22,964
some sort of a [SOUNDS LIKE SHEERSH] asana that’s all. I mean that’s we, we, we, part of it.

506
00:58:23,072 --> 00:58:28,964
Nobody reads him I mean if you read it, I mean, [INAUDIBLE] you see what he has written is

507
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:34,964
that’s what I am doing. I am quite surprised how people talk about this thing.

508
00:58:35,072 --> 00:58:41,964
What he says you achieve [SANSKRIT] means you become effortless

509
00:58:42,072 --> 00:58:46,964
first [SANSKRIT] you become without thoughtless,

510
00:58:47,072 --> 00:58:54,964
then the third thing he says you become complete negation of thought, [SANSKRIT].

511
00:58:55,072 --> 00:59:00,681
But here it is they are all jumping, talking big, this, that, how can that be?

512
00:59:00,901 --> 00:59:06,793
Meditation means jumping in the air, how can it be? [HINDI]

513
00:59:06,901 --> 00:59:11,793
Indians understand thank God, Indians are that way you see, safe.

514
00:59:11,901 --> 00:59:15,793
But there should be seeking in India. You see these people are seeking

515
00:59:15,901 --> 00:59:20,793
and striving and they are the ones who want it, I must tell you very frankly

516
00:59:20,901 --> 00:59:26,793
they are the people who really are nicely seeking, in England I am saying not in India.

517
00:59:26,901 --> 00:59:37,793
But Indians are not seeking that, but they have one great thing in them is that they know what is reality.

518
00:59:37,901 --> 00:59:42,793
They understand. You see like some of the people who went to a Guru,

519
00:59:42,901 --> 00:59:49,793
I must tell you, and he gave them a mantra for which he charged £300 in secret, in the ears,

520
00:59:49,901 --> 01:00:00,793
nobody to be told. And the mantra was “Tinga”. “Tinga” and they told Me in the ear

521
01:00:00,901 --> 01:00:08,793
and I couldn’t help laughing, “Tinga” means showing like this to someone.

522
01:00:08,901 --> 01:00:12,793
And he used to giggle at people because they were all so stupid, poor things,

523
01:00:12,901 --> 01:00:15,793
but they were seekers, real seekers, you know,

524
01:00:15,901 --> 01:00:24,793
of such high quality and this fellow who told Me was a barrister can you imagine?

525
01:00:24,901 --> 01:00:40,793
Q9. [INAUDIBLE]

526
01:00:40,901 --> 01:00:45,793
A9. Yes, you are part, you are part of the whole. You are part and parcel of the whole.

527
01:00:45,901 --> 01:00:49,793
The microcosm becomes one with the macrocosm,

528
01:00:49,901 --> 01:00:55,793
as we say in Sanskrit is Virata, you become part and parcel of that Virata.

529
01:00:55,901 --> 01:01:12,793
Q10. [INAUDIBLE]

530
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:17,793
A10. No, no, no. [INAUDIBLE] Correct.

531
01:01:17,901 --> 01:01:26,793
See it may look like that because the myth of responsibility drops out.

532
01:01:26,901 --> 01:01:33,793
Supposing, this wire thinks that it is responsible for what I am speaking,

533
01:01:33,901 --> 01:01:41,793
does it become more efficient? Say, what responsibility we have is like this.

534
01:01:41,901 --> 01:01:47,793
When we are going by a plane, question is very good, I have seen it. I mean actually,

535
01:01:47,901 --> 01:01:53,793
it must be understood in its full context it’s correct that when you think it is the responsibility of God

536
01:01:53,901 --> 01:01:56,793
you see, then you become irresponsible.

537
01:01:56,901 --> 01:02:01,793
On the contrary, you become an instrument into his hands you see.

538
01:02:01,901 --> 01:02:07,793
But you don’t think that you are doing it yourself, like you are sitting in the play.

539
01:02:07,901 --> 01:02:10,793
I give this example many a times because I have seen this happen.

540
01:02:10,901 --> 01:02:15,793
Some villagers never knew how to go by plane so they were told not to take too much luggage.

541
01:02:15,901 --> 01:02:19,793
They sat in the plane and put all their luggage on their heads.

542
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:24,793
Carrying the responsibility of the plane, saying that we have to carry the load

543
01:02:24,901 --> 01:02:29,793
because we don’t want the plane to carry all our loads you see.

544
01:02:29,901 --> 01:02:34,793
So that myth drops out, that myth drops out.

545
01:02:34,901 --> 01:02:37,793
But you become a very efficient person

546
01:02:37,901 --> 01:02:43,793
because the energy that’s divine starts dynamically working, manifesting.

547
01:02:43,901 --> 01:02:47,793
You become a dynamic person, you can do a thousand and one things

548
01:02:47,901 --> 01:02:51,793
which you have never done before, because you have become a perfect instrument.

549
01:02:51,901 --> 01:03:01,793
You are not perfect as long as you think you are doing it, you see My point?

550
01:03:01,901 --> 01:03:15,793
All of them, those who are realised souls, and you will be too.

551
01:03:15,901 --> 01:03:19,793
What work are they doing, is spiritually they are doing a lot of work, now,

552
01:03:19,901 --> 01:03:25,793
that’s another side when you’ll come to Sahaja Yoga we’ll tell you what work they are doing.

553
01:03:25,901 --> 01:03:30,793
You see what work you want us to do may not be the work that we are doing

554
01:03:30,901 --> 01:03:35,793
but we are transforming people. We are saving people from cancers and so many diseases,

555
01:03:35,901 --> 01:03:40,793
we are transforming them, we are changing them so much that they have given up drugs.

556
01:03:40,901 --> 01:03:46,793
So many people have given up alcohol, all these bad habits have dropped out.

557
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:51,793
So many people are cured of so many diseases, so many diseases we have cured already,

558
01:03:51,901 --> 01:03:57,793
when you come to us we will let you know as to what substantial work it is. all right?

559
01:03:57,901 --> 01:04:03,793
Starvation of course, our starvation. Why people are starving also

560
01:04:03,901 --> 01:04:10,793
because I think people who drink are starving because they waste their money in drink.

561
01:04:10,901 --> 01:04:13,793
If they haven’t, if they have money why should they drink?

562
01:04:13,901 --> 01:04:17,793
If they don’t have money why should they drink? But most of the people starve themselves

563
01:04:17,901 --> 01:04:22,793
because they spend all their money, in UK I am saying, not in India, India is a different thing.

564
01:04:22,901 --> 01:04:29,793
But in India people who have got realization are blessed they don’t starve anymore.

565
01:04:29,881 --> 01:04:42,131
[INAUDIBLE]

566
01:04:42,241 --> 01:04:46,790
They don’t need anything, it is said that Yoga Kshema Wiam Miam,

567
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:53,793
first you get your yoga, your union with God and then I will bless you. Kshema.

568
01:04:53,901 --> 01:04:57,793
[INAUDIBLE]

569
01:04:57,901 --> 01:05:01,793
Yes, yes, of course, of course you can pay your rates, everything,

570
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:06,793
but you just come and see before. This is the intellectual side, come inside and see,

571
01:05:06,901 --> 01:05:12,793
whether it works out or not. Why not see? Don’t argue for arguments sake, it works out.

572
01:05:12,901 --> 01:05:19,793
There’s somebody sitting behind you who has, in his life it has worked out, just behind.

573
01:05:19,901 --> 01:05:25,793
In many lives it has worked out but you come and see for yourself what miracles it has, all right?

574
01:05:25,901 --> 01:05:29,793
You come and see all previous things just drop off.

575
01:05:29,901 --> 01:05:34,793
Come and see how God is blissful after all the blessings come from God.

576
01:05:34,901 --> 01:05:39,793
But we don’t want to do anything for God and why not God look after us,

577
01:05:39,901 --> 01:05:48,793
what have you done for God so far. Can I ask a question?

578
01:05:48,901 --> 01:05:58,793
Everyone has right to ask a question to Me, I better ask you all. What have you done for God?

579
01:05:58,901 --> 01:06:15,793
Just surrender it. [INAUDIBLE] You are afraid? [INAUDIBLE] Afraid of God? [INAUDIBLE] Pray?

580
01:06:15,901 --> 01:06:22,793
But what we pray to God is “Give me my food. Give me a job.

581
01:06:22,901 --> 01:06:35,793
God get me this. Let me win this war. Let’s kill my enemies” I know all those prayers.

582
01:06:35,901 --> 01:06:53,793


583
01:06:53,901 --> 01:07:00,793
Q11. [INAUDIBLE]

584
01:07:00,901 --> 01:07:07,793
A11. First you get connected all right. First let us get connected then you will know.

585
01:07:07,901 --> 01:07:12,793
Then you will know what He wants and what He does.

586
01:07:12,901 --> 01:07:18,793
Then you will know He is very kind man, very kind,

587
01:07:18,901 --> 01:07:24,793
extremely forgiving that the way He has forgiven us for whatever we have done.

588
01:07:24,901 --> 01:07:27,793
But don’t feel guilty for it, that’s one thing I didn’t want to start,

589
01:07:27,901 --> 01:07:31,793
because you see that’s one trouble you all have is to feel guilty and I don’t want you to feel guilty

590
01:07:31,901 --> 01:07:34,793
because realization doesn’t work out.

591
01:07:34,901 --> 01:07:45,793
Don’t feel guilty it’s all right. We’ll have it next time madam, is it something important?

592
01:07:45,901 --> 01:08:12,793
Q12. [INAUDIBLE]

593
01:08:12,901 --> 01:08:15,793
A12. Talk. Talking is not the thing,

594
01:08:15,901 --> 01:08:21,793
you see what I would say you should see the way they talk has nothing to do,

595
01:08:21,901 --> 01:08:25,793
what you have to see, what have you achieved yourself.

596
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:30,793
Whatever people may talk is they might be talking because they are possessed, that’s all.

597
01:08:30,901 --> 01:08:39,793
If somebody talks big be careful, be careful, the one who does, isn’t.

598
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:44,793
You have to feel the cool breeze coming out of your head is the point I said that nobody can do,

599
01:08:44,901 --> 01:08:47,793
can anybody do that?

600
01:08:47,901 --> 01:08:59,793
Those who talk can be good actors at the most, at the worst they are possessed. [INAUDIBLE]

601
01:08:59,901 --> 01:09:10,793
Q13. [INAUDIBLE]

602
01:09:10,901 --> 01:09:14,793
A13. Your married life improves immensely.

603
01:09:14,901 --> 01:09:21,793
Because you will learn later on there is a centre for it and you understand your married life as a bliss,

604
01:09:21,901 --> 01:09:27,793
it’s absolutely pure blessings to married people. Actually you will be surprised

605
01:09:27,901 --> 01:09:30,793
we can’t give realization to people who are not married, in the sense

606
01:09:30,901 --> 01:09:38,793
who are going to marry is all right. But those who are against marriage we can’t give realization

607
01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:41,793
because they are a little imbalanced.

608
01:09:41,901 --> 01:09:50,793
I think the one we had you see, we couldn’t give realization, I hope he’s not here.

609
01:09:50,901 --> 01:09:55,793
But he is going to get married so we will give him realization,

610
01:09:55,901 --> 01:10:00,793
we just couldn’t give him, but married life improves like this.

611
01:10:00,901 --> 01:10:20,793
Q14. [INAUDIBLE]

612
01:10:20,901 --> 01:10:33,793
A 14. What is it about Bhagwan? [HINDI]

613
01:10:33,901 --> 01:10:43,793
This kind of a Bhagwan, who cannot even smell a flower. Can you think of a Bhagwan like that?

614
01:10:43,901 --> 01:10:48,793
You know in the Devi Mahatmayam or into the Vishnu Shastranama,

615
01:10:48,901 --> 01:10:56,793
or anyone of them where there is a described God at least twenty five names of God is he’s fond of flower, fragrance, flower.

616
01:10:56,901 --> 01:11:02,793
I can’t live without flowers and the fellow who cannot smell a flower [HINDI]

617
01:11:02,901 --> 01:11:08,793
I mean what do you give him? Phenyl or something?

618
01:11:08,901 --> 01:11:28,793
This is one of the tests. How can you be a Bhagwan? [SANSKRIT] These are the names of God.

619
01:11:28,901 --> 01:11:49,793
Q15. [INAUDIBLE]

620
01:11:49,901 --> 01:11:54,793
A15. You see, say now if I give you Indian money say 100 rupees how do you know it is 100 rupees?

621
01:11:54,901 --> 01:11:58,793
You have to go to India and spend it and see if it works out or not.

622
01:11:58,901 --> 01:12:03,793
In the same way when you get the vibrations and you feel the cool breeze you spend it

623
01:12:03,901 --> 01:12:09,793
and see for yourself and judge it.

624
01:12:09,901 --> 01:12:14,793
You can do the whole process yourself, you can give realization to others all right?

625
01:12:14,901 --> 01:12:19,793


626
01:12:19,901 --> 01:12:24,793
You see now I would say please get your realization, if you get it, I don’t promise, if you get it.

627
01:12:24,901 --> 01:12:31,793
That’s a very big if, sometimes. I know it happens if you get it

628
01:12:31,901 --> 01:12:37,793
then you have to go and see for yourself whether it works or not.

629
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:43,793
But to get it is not easy in certain cases,

630
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:50,793
so be cheerful about it and be patient with yourself.

631
01:12:50,901 --> 01:12:54,793
More patience is needed with yourself, not with Me because I am extremely patient.

632
01:12:54,901 --> 01:12:59,793
You have to be patient with yourself because your mind will be coming up and always saying something,

633
01:12:59,901 --> 01:13:03,793
you didn’t ask this question, you should have asked this question, tell your mind to be quiet.

634
01:13:03,901 --> 01:13:07,793
Take your realization, lets see if it works out.

635
01:13:07,901 --> 01:13:15,793
We cannot assure, it may, it may not, it’s your luck, that’s it.

636
01:13:15,901 --> 01:13:43,793
Q16. [INAUDIBLE]

637
01:13:43,901 --> 01:13:48,793
A16. This conscious mind that you have just now is the human awareness, all right,

638
01:13:48,901 --> 01:13:55,793
at this point the human awareness is at such a stage, that you are not connected with your spirit.

639
01:13:55,901 --> 01:13:59,793
First your human awareness has to be raised it has to be brought to that point

640
01:13:59,901 --> 01:14:03,793
where you get connected. Like this instrument is here now,

641
01:14:03,901 --> 01:14:07,793
consciously whatever you do with this it is not connected, it has no meaning.

642
01:14:07,901 --> 01:14:10,793
In the same way first you should be connected.

643
01:14:10,901 --> 01:14:14,793
After connecting only we can see where is the problem is, what is missing, what is it

644
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:19,793
and is to be done. So we have to take a very reasonable attitude towards it,

645
01:14:19,901 --> 01:14:23,793
about ourselves, to understand that maybe there is something missing,

646
01:14:23,901 --> 01:14:28,793
something is happening, it’s not working out.

647
01:14:28,901 --> 01:14:35,793
Because at this awareness, at this consciousness that you have, this human consciousness is not sufficient.

648
01:14:35,901 --> 01:14:39,793
So you have to jump, there’s a breakthrough, and you have to achieve that breakthrough.

649
01:14:39,901 --> 01:14:43,793
Which I will not promise, as I told that gentleman there you, it cannot be promised,

650
01:14:43,901 --> 01:14:51,793
it has to be achieved. If you get it then you have to have patience with yourself work it out and see for yourself.

651
01:14:51,901 --> 01:15:03,793
Q17. [INAUDIBLE]

652
01:15:03,901 --> 01:15:06,793
A17. Yes They did because that was the time you see.

653
01:15:06,901 --> 01:15:09,793
Now Jesus came at a time when our Agnya chakra was opened,

654
01:15:09,901 --> 01:15:18,793
see it’s like a Tree of Life has to grow you see and They come at a proper time what has to grow.

655
01:15:18,901 --> 01:15:22,793
Now if it’s the root time and somebody else came in, when the shoot started

656
01:15:22,901 --> 01:15:26,793
somebody else came in gradually it has come up to this point. Now Mohammed,

657
01:15:26,901 --> 01:15:29,793
what Mohamed has said, nobody says that today.

658
01:15:29,901 --> 01:15:34,793
All the Muslims must know that He said “At the time of the resurrection your hands must speak”,

659
01:15:34,901 --> 01:15:40,793
where is that? He said it I mean nobody else but Mohammed had said so clearly about it.

660
01:15:40,901 --> 01:15:47,793
And what does He say is not known nobody knows why He said [INAUDIBLE-namas] like this.

661
01:15:47,901 --> 01:15:50,793
Nobody asked questions, why do you follow?

662
01:15:50,901 --> 01:15:54,793
But after Sahaja yoga will know what [INAUDIBLE] what Mohammed means,

663
01:15:54,901 --> 01:15:59,793
who He was and why He said so what is so important about it.

664
01:15:59,901 --> 01:16:04,793
You can’t understand even Mohammed or anyone, Jesus or anyone, without realization

665
01:16:04,901 --> 01:16:10,793
because you have not entered into that rank, you see My point.

666
01:16:10,901 --> 01:16:16,793
Because the time that time was not to say whatever They had to do They did very important work very, very important.

667
01:16:16,901 --> 01:16:20,793
Every one of Them have worked very hard.

668
01:16:20,901 --> 01:16:28,793
Only I must say that today I am at an advantage than They are

669
01:16:28,901 --> 01:16:37,793
because so many are getting self-realization. They had a very bad time.

670
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:44,793
They had a very bad time nobody accepted Them. All acceptance came later on when

671
01:16:44,901 --> 01:16:47,793
They were not there and people liked to have such acceptance

672
01:16:47,901 --> 01:16:52,793
because they can do what they like. They don’t want to,

673
01:16:52,901 --> 01:16:56,793
nobody asked Them for realization at that time, nobody, everybody tried just to kill Them.

674
01:16:56,901 --> 01:17:05,793
I mean everybody was anxious how to get rid of Them, isn’t it a fact?

675
01:17:05,901 --> 01:17:09,793
Like today as there are so many who want their realization that time was not there.

676
01:17:09,901 --> 01:17:14,793
Today is the time, all right?

677
01:17:14,901 --> 01:17:45,793
Q18. [INAUDIBLE]

678
01:17:45,901 --> 01:17:49,793
A18. You see that you don’t even need one minute for that, to say, “I’m born again”

679
01:17:49,901 --> 01:17:55,793
it is all self-opinionated thing, just to say. But you have to have powers you see

680
01:17:55,901 --> 01:17:57,793
that’s what I told you the whole lecture was like that.

681
01:17:57,901 --> 01:18:02,793
That once you get self realised you get the powers you have collective consciousness you become conscious.

682
01:18:02,901 --> 01:18:08,793
You see it is very easy to say, just to put the, I don’t know how much they pay

683
01:18:08,901 --> 01:18:13,793
but you just put the name membership “I’m born again”. You don’t know this born again people,

684
01:18:13,901 --> 01:18:18,793
horribly hot tempered, useless people absolutely. You see some of them brought some bibles

685
01:18:18,901 --> 01:18:22,793
and one lady bearing all artificial jewellery here and there and she came to give Me the bible

686
01:18:22,901 --> 01:18:28,793
and I just ignored her. I just started laughing and she was quite surprised to hear this sound.

687
01:18:28,901 --> 01:18:34,793
So this is what born again how can they be born again if they can’t make out a saint.

688
01:18:34,901 --> 01:18:37,793
How can they be born again? [INAUDIBLE]

689
01:18:37,901 --> 01:18:51,793


690
01:18:51,901 --> 01:19:00,793
Only the truth will survive. All these are fads and things [INAUDIBLE] it has no meaning.

1
01:19:02,217 --> 01:19:10,109
Let’s have our realization now all of us, but I don’t promise as I said it’s your own lookout.

2
01:19:10,217 --> 01:19:16,109
If you believe in our, according to Indian thing if you believe, according to our former karmas

3
01:19:16,217 --> 01:19:23,109
according to our previous things that we get Atma Sakshatkar, because it’s the highest to have.

4
01:19:23,217 --> 01:19:29,109
So let’s see what happens. And also My compassion, My love,

5
01:19:29,217 --> 01:19:35,109
My desire that you all should get your realisation and establish it

6
01:19:35,217 --> 01:19:42,109
and become powerful Sahaja yogis and understand it fully.

7
01:19:42,217 --> 01:19:49,109
Now those who are here have to follow what I say,

8
01:19:49,217 --> 01:19:53,109
is very simple method by which you help yourself. As I said you are your own guru

9
01:19:53,217 --> 01:19:59,109
and on different chakras we have to work it out and it works.

10
01:19:59,217 --> 01:20:04,109
So please take out your shoes for one reason, that the Mother Earth helps us

11
01:20:04,217 --> 01:20:11,109
to sort of earth some of the problems that have come from the Mother Earth.

12
01:20:11,217 --> 01:20:19,109
Now, you have to keep your eyes shut throughout, not to open your eyes.

13
01:20:19,217 --> 01:20:27,109
The reasons are many but one of them is that the centre of Agnya,

14
01:20:27,217 --> 01:20:35,109
which is placed between the pituitary and the pineal body, is a very important centre.

15
01:20:35,217 --> 01:20:43,109
It is the gate and it doesn’t open if your eyes are open outside just now.

16
01:20:43,217 --> 01:20:49,109
So please keep your eyes shut till then and maybe the kundalini may not also rise.

17
01:20:49,217 --> 01:20:55,109
The whole attitude should be that I should get my realization. You’re not going to lose anything,

18
01:20:55,217 --> 01:21:01,109
I don’t take any money, nothing of the kind, and there is nothing to gain out of it anyway.

19
01:21:01,217 --> 01:21:06,109
So just you have to gain something out of it so, in a humble way,

20
01:21:06,217 --> 01:21:12,109
you have to sit down and put your hands on your lap.

21
01:21:12,217 --> 01:21:18,109
Those people who have come for the first time, or are standing there, can come forward here

22
01:21:18,217 --> 01:21:21,109
and sit down and the Sahaja yogis should give them places.

23
01:21:21,217 --> 01:21:29,109
Sahaja yogis should never take the first places, I would request, it would be a good idea.

24
01:21:29,217 --> 01:21:46,109


25
01:21:46,217 --> 01:21:56,109
All right, just try to sit on the side if possible, those who have come for the first time.

26
01:21:56,217 --> 01:23:18,109
[ASIDE ABOUT A PARKED CAR]

27
01:23:18,217 --> 01:23:24,109
Now, as I told you, you don’t have to do anything. It’s an effortless thing that happens,

28
01:23:24,217 --> 01:23:29,109
it’s a happening, and the kundalini rises by itself.

29
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:34,109
Only put both your feet straight on the Mother Earth. Straight, as far as possible,

30
01:23:34,217 --> 01:23:38,109
straight touching the Mother Earth. But those who are sitting on the ground are all right,

31
01:23:38,217 --> 01:23:54,109
they can sit with [HINDI], on the ground is all right. [HINDI]

32
01:23:54,217 --> 01:24:08,109
Now put your both the hands towards Me, as I told you, and close your eyes.

33
01:24:08,217 --> 01:24:13,109
We have to have a proper attitude towards ourselves.

34
01:24:13,217 --> 01:24:17,109
Firstly, it’s going to be the happiest thing that is going to happen to us,

35
01:24:17,217 --> 01:24:22,109
and the highest thing that we have been asking for ages.

36
01:24:22,217 --> 01:24:28,109
So we are not to be in any way under any tension about it, it’s really happening to all of us.

37
01:24:28,217 --> 01:24:34,109
Sit with a very cheerful mind, not frivolous but cheerful mind.

38
01:24:34,217 --> 01:24:38,109
And secondly you have to respect yourself.

39
01:24:38,217 --> 01:24:42,109
If there is any guilt or anything in your mind, it won’t work out, as I told you.

40
01:24:42,217 --> 01:24:46,109
You must know you’re saints, born to get self-realization.

41
01:24:46,217 --> 01:24:54,109
You are, as described by William Blake, you are men of God, who have to become prophets,

42
01:24:54,217 --> 01:24:57,109
who will have powers to make others prophets.

43
01:24:57,217 --> 01:25:02,109
So, that is the attitude we should have towards ourselves, that’s how you are here today.

44
01:25:02,217 --> 01:25:08,109
Please do not condemn yourself, do not have any guilt about yourself, nothing of the kind.

45
01:25:08,217 --> 01:25:13,109
Just believe in yourself, that you are the Spirit.

46
01:25:13,217 --> 01:25:24,109
Now, you have to keep both the hands on your lap (you can keep your purse down, lady, you can keep it, it’s all right).

47
01:25:24,217 --> 01:25:30,109
Now put your both the hands towards Me, close your eyes fully.

48
01:25:30,217 --> 01:25:36,109
Some of you must have already started feeling a little cool breeze in your hands.

49
01:25:36,217 --> 01:25:46,109
Put both the hands like this, open upwards, just as like you do for [INAUDIBLE] or something.

50
01:25:46,217 --> 01:25:51,109


51
01:25:51,217 --> 01:25:59,109
The left side, as I told you the other day, is for your desire, and the right side is for action.

52
01:25:59,217 --> 01:26:06,109
So we are going to put the left hand, all the time, as it is, desiring to be one with the Divine.

53
01:26:06,217 --> 01:26:20,109
And the right hand we are going to use for the action of removing the obstacles in our centres.

54
01:26:20,217 --> 01:26:28,109
So, first put the right hand on the heart, just on the heart, on the left hand side.

55
01:26:28,217 --> 01:26:40,109
Here resides the Spirit in human beings, so, now you ask Me a question without opening your eyes.

56
01:26:40,217 --> 01:26:47,109
You can call Me Mataji or Mother, as you like, whichever way you want to call Me.

57
01:26:47,217 --> 01:26:53,109
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

58
01:26:53,217 --> 01:26:59,109
Ask the question thrice, you have a right to ask Me that question.

59
01:26:59,217 --> 01:27:17,109


60
01:27:17,217 --> 01:27:24,109
Now this right hand has to be taken down on the stomach, on the left hand side, on the upper part of the stomach.

61
01:27:24,217 --> 01:27:35,109
This is the centre of your mastery, or what we call the guru centre, it is on the left hand side of your stomach.

62
01:27:35,217 --> 01:27:42,109
On the left hand side you put this right hand. Put the left hand towards Me as it is.

63
01:27:42,217 --> 01:27:52,109
Now, here you ask a question, because you, as a spirit, has to be your own master, has to be your own Guru.

64
01:27:52,217 --> 01:27:59,109
So you ask Me a question thrice again, “Mother, am I my own Guru?” ask Me.

65
01:27:59,217 --> 01:28:03,109
With full confidence, “Am I my own master?”

66
01:28:03,217 --> 01:28:25,109
On the higher part of the stomach, please put your right hand on the higher part of the stomach.

67
01:28:25,217 --> 01:28:36,109
Now, put this right hand on the left hand side of your stomach, in the lower region.

68
01:28:36,217 --> 01:28:41,109
There’s a centre there, in the lower region of your stomach, lower region of your stomach.

69
01:28:41,217 --> 01:28:45,109
On the left hand side, keeping the left hand towards Me.

70
01:28:45,217 --> 01:29:03,109
Now, this is the centre where is the knowledge of the working of your kundalini.

71
01:29:03,217 --> 01:29:10,109
In this centre, called as Shuddha Vidya, meaning the pure knowledge.

72
01:29:10,217 --> 01:29:19,109
As this point, I’m sorry but you have to ask for it, I cannot force anyone into it,

73
01:29:19,217 --> 01:29:24,109
like you cannot force a student to accept any knowledge.

74
01:29:24,217 --> 01:29:37,109
In the same way you have to say “Mother, give me that pure knowledge” or you can say “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”,

75
01:29:37,217 --> 01:29:42,109
you have to ask six times, because this centre has got six sub plexuses.

76
01:29:42,217 --> 01:29:53,109
So you have to ask six times, in a very humble way, “Mother, please give me that Shuddha Vidya”.

77
01:29:53,217 --> 01:29:59,109
That is the first asking.

78
01:29:59,217 --> 01:30:14,109
See this prayer, this is such a pure prayer. Give me the Shuddha Vidya, give me the pure knowledge of the Divine, the working of the Divine.

79
01:30:14,217 --> 01:30:32,109
Now, as you have entered into that realm of asking Me for the pure knowledge, the first thing you have to assume, is that
