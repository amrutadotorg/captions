00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:01.710
AI GENERATED. Words that I would like to learn

1
00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.549
and

2
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:04.539
I'm very happy that you have come.

3
00:00:06.059 --> 00:00:08.720
And I will request Matahi to save you.

4
00:00:15.399 --> 00:00:16.909
Now you ask me questions.

5
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:18.270
Come home.

6
00:00:20.389 --> 00:00:21.889
Can we feel these experiences.

7
00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:23.469
What?

8
00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:24.850
Yes,

9
00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.020
yes,

10
00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.340
yes,

11
00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:26.790
yes,

12
00:00:26.819 --> 00:00:26.979
yes,

13
00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.450
you should,

14
00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:28.219
you should,

15
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.750
you should,

16
00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:29.790
you should be right now.

17
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.049
Why not?

18
00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.680
You sure you want to feel it first before asking questions.

19
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.560
That's the best.

20
00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:36.049
I mean,

21
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.919
if you are a seeker,

22
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.729
you should ask for that.

23
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:39.770
What's this of asking questions?

24
00:00:39.849 --> 00:00:41.360
I'm not a political leader,

25
00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:42.880
not seeking votes.

26
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.560
Best thing is that,

27
00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.080
yes,

28
00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:45.529
why not,

29
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.720
and especially you.

30
00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:49.900
Firstly because you're Indians

31
00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.020
and you come from Kerala

32
00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:54.080
where Ravi Shankaracharya was born.

33
00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:56.840
White was born.

34
00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.799
Lake

35
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:01.389
Province.

36
00:01:02.909 --> 00:01:03.450
You can,

37
00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:04.160
why not?

38
00:01:04.529 --> 00:01:05.650
Just put your hands towards me,

39
00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:06.099
you can.

40
00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:07.330
If you want to ask me questions,

41
00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.139
you can ask.

42
00:01:08.489 --> 00:01:08.720
You see,

43
00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.330
it's a,

44
00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:10.900
it's a question of what you want.

45
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.589
Not

46
00:01:14.849 --> 00:01:16.459
only that you can feel it,

47
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.610
but you can see with your naked eyes,

48
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.709
the rising of the bone.

49
00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:21.589
You can see the pulsation

50
00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:22.849
on the triangular bone.

51
00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.089
You can see the rising very clearly.

52
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:26.660
Absolutely,

53
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.559
with the stethoscope.

54
00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:29.790
Now we have Doctor Borgi with us luckily he's here.

55
00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:31.919
You can see it tries.

56
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.120
Yes,

57
00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.269
that's the best.

58
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:41.680
All right,

59
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.569
to ask the questions first of all,

60
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.319
the way you like,

61
00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.309
but to move forward.

62
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.919
It's,

63
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
it's a question just a split of a second to immunise,

64
00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.830
but.

65
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:51.569
There is a little part,

66
00:01:53.089 --> 00:01:53.489
the

67
00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.010
part of the food sometimes is blocked by your physical,

68
00:01:56.089 --> 00:01:56.500
mental,

69
00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.400
emotional

70
00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.709
disturbances,

71
00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.279
which are these different chapters which we have to nourish a little bit.

72
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.940
Again,

73
00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:05.690
thousands of them are just like this in the villages,

74
00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.980
especially.

75
00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.330
That's why I said I'm more interested in the villages than in this 5 star hotel.

76
00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.869
It's very easy to give realisation treated before them I get it.

77
00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.009
It's very difficult task to work in London,

78
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.410
but in an Indian village just like this house,

79
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:21.119
just like.

80
00:02:22.089 --> 00:02:24.410
Because definitely this is a yoga movie.

81
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.360
You have to be proud of it,

82
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.520
but we have to know what our country is.

83
00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.520
We have to know our heritage

84
00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:34.410
myself.

85
00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:36.070
I ask,

86
00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.509
you see,

87
00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:37.589
if you ask me this question,

88
00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:38.839
I'll have to ask you one question,

89
00:02:38.919 --> 00:02:39.789
so that will explain.

90
00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:43.309
If I ask you what state did you realise you are a human being?

91
00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:45.949
If I ask you a question,

92
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.360
what state did you realise you were a human being?

93
00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.559
You won't be able to say.

94
00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.350
No,

95
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.369
no,

96
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:50.460
no training is needed for me.

97
00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:57.000
See,

98
00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:58.440
you are a human being.

99
00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.929
It is,

100
00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:01.199
it is inbuilt.

101
00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:02.639
It is all inbuilt,

102
00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:03.240
you see.

103
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:05.250
So supposing you are a human being,

104
00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:08.360
so your capacity as a human being,

105
00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:10.080
isn't built within you,

106
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.679
is it?

107
00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.779
You don't have to be told that you are a human being.

108
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.029
In the series,

109
00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.259
it has happened.

110
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.479
Yes,

111
00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:26.889
you are quite aware.

112
00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.149
Can you tell me what permit it happened to you that you were aware?

113
00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.399
You know you are a human being in the same way you know you are this.

114
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:37.979
You know

115
00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.440
You grow up like a child first of all.

116
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.169
Still,

117
00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:42.800
you know.

118
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.770
Gradually.

119
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.039
A dog knows he's a dog.

120
00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.259
A human child knows he's a human child

121
00:03:49.529 --> 00:03:50.610
that he's not a dog.

122
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:53.169
What I,

123
00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.889
what is the difference of uh between philosophy and the philosophy of mind.

124
00:03:58.130 --> 00:03:58.460
Oh,

125
00:03:58.470 --> 00:03:59.369
tremendous,

126
00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:00.750
absolutely tremendous.

127
00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:02.899
Now I would say one thing more again,

128
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.809
you see,

129
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.570
because I'm your mother and you must guard my,

130
00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.570
uh,

131
00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.289
estate about it because you see,

132
00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.199
the government has sponsored this and all this is the

133
00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:14.850
first time I have yielded to a thing like that.

134
00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.589
So I don't want to fall into a controversy,

135
00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:18.369
but

136
00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:20.579
it's just the opposite of mine.

137
00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:21.488
I get it.

138
00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:25.079
Absolutely just their opposite.

139
00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.829
You just think of something like you give somebody a name.

140
00:04:28.989 --> 00:04:29.160
I mean,

141
00:04:29.239 --> 00:04:30.760
why do you need a guru to give a name?

142
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.369
All right,

143
00:04:33.179 --> 00:04:33.899
then you give a name.

144
00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.869
There's a big Shasta.

145
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:35.959
If you come to Sergioga,

146
00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.809
you will know

147
00:04:37.019 --> 00:04:38.429
that different datings are after surgery.

148
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.359
Then we ch is wrong with you.

149
00:04:42.839 --> 00:04:43.559
Accordingly,

150
00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.640
you have to be told that take that name of that deity at that particular centre.

151
00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:51.299
Then the kundalini moves from that centre to another centre.

152
00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:53.000
So you have to be told that

153
00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.750
there is no talk of kundalini or chakras or anything.

154
00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:56.970
You just give somebody a name,

155
00:04:57.010 --> 00:04:57.290
you see,

156
00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:58.769
it is like saying that,

157
00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:59.119
uh,

158
00:04:59.130 --> 00:04:59.679
take this,

159
00:04:59.690 --> 00:04:59.880
uh,

160
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:02.959
toothbrush and brush your teeth and you'll have a leg.

161
00:05:04.519 --> 00:05:05.299
Before and after,

162
00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:05.670
sort of,

163
00:05:05.739 --> 00:05:07.130
it's all advertising thing.

164
00:05:07.299 --> 00:05:07.579
Moreover,

165
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:08.649
it's much deeper.

166
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:10.540
I've seen people who go to transcendental

167
00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.809
meditation are very difficult to get realisation,

168
00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.970
very difficult.

169
00:05:14.299 --> 00:05:16.279
We have got here 3 people from Transcendental.

170
00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.010
They had tremendous headaches.

171
00:05:18.339 --> 00:05:19.369
They suffered a lot.

172
00:05:19.579 --> 00:05:20.299
When they came to me,

173
00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:21.660
they were just rattling like this.

174
00:05:22.829 --> 00:05:24.869
Now you might say that I may be wrong

175
00:05:25.269 --> 00:05:25.660
too,

176
00:05:25.829 --> 00:05:25.910
see,

177
00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:26.859
I may be wrong,

178
00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:29.190
but now how you determine this way

179
00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.170
that if you bring a math person,

180
00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.179
a lunatic person,

181
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.589
he also ts this.

182
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:35.869
If you bring a possessed person,

183
00:05:35.899 --> 00:05:36.779
he also travel business.

184
00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:40.619
In the same way they tremble before

185
00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:42.880
and rather difficult to give them realisation,

186
00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.760
they take time.

187
00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.049
No,

188
00:05:48.529 --> 00:05:49.329
I do not take.

189
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:50.170
I do not take.

190
00:05:50.209 --> 00:05:51.000
I'm sorry.

191
00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:51.809
I do.

192
00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:52.619
They do.

193
00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:53.320
You see,

194
00:05:53.329 --> 00:05:55.179
these people are not me.

195
00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:56.209
That's a different thing,

196
00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.559
you see,

197
00:05:56.649 --> 00:05:59.049
this is the way it is always the human mind is

198
00:05:59.049 --> 00:06:01.269
from the other side and mind is from the other side.

199
00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:02.339
Why should I claim?

200
00:06:03.049 --> 00:06:04.540
Does the son claim that I'm sad?

201
00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:06.399
Why shouldn't you?

202
00:06:06.809 --> 00:06:07.720
If you are that you are that.

203
00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:09.690
Do you claim that you are a human being to anyone?

204
00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.549
What is your concept?

205
00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:15.040
You see these Alcaras.

206
00:06:15.829 --> 00:06:17.690
It is a divine.

207
00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:18.399
Now,

208
00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:18.809
first of all,

209
00:06:18.929 --> 00:06:20.040
do you believe in God?

210
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.609
Begin.

211
00:06:22.829 --> 00:06:24.190
Do you all right,

212
00:06:24.329 --> 00:06:25.540
if you believe in God,

213
00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:27.540
God has to.

214
00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:30.510
Take you say from amoeba stage to shoot.

215
00:06:31.149 --> 00:06:31.670
How does it?

216
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.920
How does he guide you?

217
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.209
He has to have some way of guiding you.

218
00:06:37.929 --> 00:06:38.339
So,

219
00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:39.100
uh,

220
00:06:39.589 --> 00:06:41.140
one of his aspects,

221
00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:43.260
which is known as the Vishnu aspect,

222
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:45.380
let's say the evolutionary aspect,

223
00:06:45.869 --> 00:06:48.339
takes different forms at different stages,

224
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.679
comes on this earth,

225
00:06:49.869 --> 00:06:50.779
and tries to that

226
00:06:51.670 --> 00:06:53.670
like a fish wanting to come out of this.

227
00:06:54.519 --> 00:06:55.910
So a fish of that.

228
00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:57.339
Like that,

229
00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:00.570
all the Otaras are nothing but guiding leaders,

230
00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:01.709
which came from divine.

231
00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:04.429
There is another psychological way

232
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.600
that they describe as

233
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:08.839
Young has said.

234
00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:10.279
You was a disciple of God.

235
00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:12.769
He said that through our unconscious,

236
00:07:12.809 --> 00:07:14.279
in our dreams they got.

237
00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:16.519
The divine power guides,

238
00:07:16.549 --> 00:07:18.230
the all pervading power guides.

239
00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:19.920
But dreams,

240
00:07:19.929 --> 00:07:22.079
when the time we are awakened

241
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:23.250
out of dreams,

242
00:07:23.329 --> 00:07:24.329
we forget most of it,

243
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.269
so the guidance is not good.

244
00:07:27.049 --> 00:07:27.450
After all,

245
00:07:27.529 --> 00:07:29.559
somebody has to tell you about the divine.

246
00:07:30.369 --> 00:07:32.250
I have to tell you where are your children.

247
00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.579
I have to tell you how you catch them.

248
00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:37.299
I have to tell you what are these fingers for.

249
00:07:37.339 --> 00:07:39.750
You will see all that we have done very elaborate.

250
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:41.339
And these fingers,

251
00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:42.820
what are these chakras are?

252
00:07:42.950 --> 00:07:43.230
Actually,

253
00:07:43.269 --> 00:07:46.220
I studied your medicine just to talk to doctors.

254
00:07:46.549 --> 00:07:49.589
I studied also a little bit of psychology to talk to the psychologist.

255
00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:52.390
Because God does not have language.

256
00:07:56.869 --> 00:08:00.250
So do your disciples claim that you are the second coming of Christ?

257
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:01.890
No,

258
00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:03.279
I'm not Christ.

259
00:08:03.489 --> 00:08:04.600
Christ has to come,

260
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:06.040
but when he will come,

261
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.170
he will not spare anyone.

262
00:08:08.570 --> 00:08:09.410
That's what it is.

263
00:08:10.859 --> 00:08:13.779
I'm just preparing for that time because I'm a,

264
00:08:14.290 --> 00:08:15.690
he'll just come and slash out.

265
00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:18.709
He will come,

266
00:08:18.929 --> 00:08:20.579
but he is not going to come to give you

267
00:08:20.579 --> 00:08:24.250
realisation and to convince you of righteousness and say no,

268
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:27.339
he's coming for the last sorting out what we do

269
00:08:27.339 --> 00:08:30.209
to our banana trees when the fruits are out,

270
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:31.579
cut them out in the same.

271
00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.250
He's going to come for the last one,

272
00:08:34.099 --> 00:08:35.340
and that's a very short time,

273
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.419
so we have to be careful.

274
00:08:39.659 --> 00:08:40.909
So what do you do actually

275
00:08:44.020 --> 00:08:45.570
You see what I do is

276
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:46.940
uh this uh come here,

277
00:08:46.979 --> 00:08:47.359
come here,

278
00:08:47.409 --> 00:08:47.460
it's all right.

279
00:08:49.140 --> 00:08:50.619
What we do is to.

280
00:08:51.989 --> 00:08:53.590
Now I'll tell you something about medical science,

281
00:08:53.669 --> 00:08:54.030
which is,

282
00:08:54.109 --> 00:08:54.580
you know,

283
00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:55.750
it's quite boring,

284
00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:57.440
but if you don't mind,

285
00:08:57.510 --> 00:08:59.869
I will explain to you what happens because you see,

286
00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:01.109
if you ask me to put on the sign,

287
00:09:01.179 --> 00:09:02.460
it's very easy to press the button,

288
00:09:02.469 --> 00:09:03.150
isn't it?

289
00:09:03.299 --> 00:09:04.520
But what did I do

290
00:09:04.669 --> 00:09:05.710
and how it worked out?

291
00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:06.909
What was the electrical thing?

292
00:09:06.989 --> 00:09:08.359
What was the history behind it?

293
00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:08.799
Of course,

294
00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:10.309
there is an organisation.

295
00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:11.510
So if you want,

296
00:09:11.590 --> 00:09:13.380
I can explain to you what I do.

297
00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:13.630
Yes,

298
00:09:13.869 --> 00:09:14.150
actually,

299
00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:15.239
I don't do anything I would say.

300
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:17.919
It just it just happens

301
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:21.119
that uh you have got already built in

302
00:09:21.479 --> 00:09:23.130
in the mechanism,

303
00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.289
the complete mechanism you you can open the page and see

304
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.750
there is a picture of a human being sitting with the mechanism.

305
00:09:29.859 --> 00:09:32.179
You can see open yourself so you can have a look at.

306
00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:36.099
Then I got to drive one of that so.

307
00:09:43.369 --> 00:09:44.369
Now you can see here,

308
00:09:44.599 --> 00:09:45.659
see this one,

309
00:09:45.729 --> 00:09:46.520
this is the picture.

310
00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:47.419
This is the

311
00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:48.729
subtle energy,

312
00:09:48.849 --> 00:09:50.559
a subtle instrument within us.

313
00:09:50.609 --> 00:09:51.599
This is.

314
00:09:53.299 --> 00:09:53.669
Now,

315
00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:55.340
Of course,

316
00:09:55.390 --> 00:09:59.450
I mean you can't see this with your naked eyes because this is an energy form,

317
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:01.979
but if it is there or not for that,

318
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:06.900
you have to come to Saga and see with your own eyes that this residual energy here,

319
00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:08.940
this triangular bone residual energy,

320
00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:09.989
rises

321
00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:11.989
like this and opens out.

322
00:10:12.155 --> 00:10:14.885
This is the baptism about which Christ has told you.

323
00:10:15.184 --> 00:10:16.705
He said that you are baptist,

324
00:10:16.864 --> 00:10:20.094
but not by the people who are graduated from theological college.

325
00:10:20.265 --> 00:10:21.614
You cannot graduate.

326
00:10:21.784 --> 00:10:22.744
You have to have it.

327
00:10:22.984 --> 00:10:24.215
You have to become a saint.

328
00:10:24.385 --> 00:10:28.335
That means this must open out unless and until you are enlightened

329
00:10:28.635 --> 00:10:29.505
like a light.

330
00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:35.140
Which is enlightened like a car which is enlighten can enlighten another candle.

331
00:10:36.450 --> 00:10:38.429
Now you have to be a candle to begin with,

332
00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:40.520
and that is the can you are.

333
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:41.960
You are already made like that.

334
00:10:41.969 --> 00:10:44.520
You are an instrument which is already prepared like this.

335
00:10:44.609 --> 00:10:46.090
You can say like this tape record.

336
00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.320
You are made like this like a uh computer,

337
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:52.210
and you are just to be put to the maids and the whole thing starts for.

338
00:10:53.679 --> 00:10:54.770
It's the finding of the.

339
00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:57.260
Now what I do in medical aid,

340
00:10:57.570 --> 00:10:59.039
I have explained in my

341
00:10:59.489 --> 00:11:00.210
article here,

342
00:11:00.250 --> 00:11:03.039
which means this is uh I had addressed to the medical

343
00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:03.830
people

344
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.760
and this is the address that you can see for yourself,

345
00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:07.919
but uh it was.

346
00:11:09.090 --> 00:11:09.609
Now,

347
00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:10.880
this one is here.

348
00:11:14.729 --> 00:11:15.200
Now,

349
00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:15.520
uh,

350
00:11:15.559 --> 00:11:20.159
what you can understand is that God has made you from amoeba to a human being,

351
00:11:20.409 --> 00:11:21.049
all right?

352
00:11:21.530 --> 00:11:21.960
Now,

353
00:11:22.210 --> 00:11:23.799
after a human being stage,

354
00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.010
what does he want you to be?

355
00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.650
Why did he make you a human being?

356
00:11:29.010 --> 00:11:30.000
Why were you made?

357
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.549
Have you got your fulfilment,

358
00:11:31.690 --> 00:11:33.030
supposing I make some machine,

359
00:11:33.229 --> 00:11:33.989
then you'll ask mother,

360
00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.229
why are you making this machine?

361
00:11:35.849 --> 00:11:38.080
That must have its fulfilment or not.

362
00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:40.130
That instrument must have its fulfilment,

363
00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.530
so you are made like this.

364
00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:42.799
It is already made.

365
00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:43.880
It's all prepared.

366
00:11:44.729 --> 00:11:45.830
I don't have to do anything.

367
00:11:45.919 --> 00:11:48.669
Just what I do is when the kundalini sees

368
00:11:48.669 --> 00:11:51.030
because it is a consciousness which knows me.

369
00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.640
It just,

370
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:52.559
it's automatic.

371
00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.349
How do you do it?

372
00:11:54.489 --> 00:11:55.479
How do you do that?

373
00:11:55.719 --> 00:11:55.929
You see,

374
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.640
because it is a consciousness which knows which just runs.

375
00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.340
How do you make a fish rice to a bake?

376
00:12:03.179 --> 00:12:04.210
What do you do?

377
00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:05.099
It has the hunger.

378
00:12:05.109 --> 00:12:05.140
It is just

379
00:12:09.049 --> 00:12:09.340
in that.

380
00:12:10.869 --> 00:12:10.989
No,

381
00:12:11.109 --> 00:12:11.200
no,

382
00:12:11.309 --> 00:12:12.750
this is a residual consciousness.

383
00:12:13.710 --> 00:12:15.599
The consciousness has many,

384
00:12:15.830 --> 00:12:16.440
many,

385
00:12:17.010 --> 00:12:17.479
uh,

386
00:12:17.890 --> 00:12:18.669
aspects.

387
00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:18.849
See,

388
00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:19.479
we have

389
00:12:19.609 --> 00:12:20.369
in different ways,

390
00:12:20.409 --> 00:12:21.289
we have consciousness.

391
00:12:21.409 --> 00:12:21.919
First of all,

392
00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:24.760
we have the conscious mind which you are listening to me,

393
00:12:25.039 --> 00:12:25.530
all right?

394
00:12:25.729 --> 00:12:26.840
You are listening to me.

395
00:12:27.049 --> 00:12:29.409
Now all the experiences and everything that you are

396
00:12:29.409 --> 00:12:31.880
listening to me is going into your past,

397
00:12:32.369 --> 00:12:34.320
so we can say that is the subconscious.

398
00:12:34.809 --> 00:12:35.239
Then

399
00:12:35.369 --> 00:12:37.599
the with which there is a conscious mind,

400
00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:39.369
which also thinks for the future.

401
00:12:40.169 --> 00:12:41.479
That is the preconscious mind.

402
00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.450
Now I'm talking about the super conscious

403
00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:47.289
where you become.

404
00:12:48.799 --> 00:12:50.039
One with all pervading,

405
00:12:51.080 --> 00:12:52.260
so you become collectively.

406
00:12:53.580 --> 00:12:55.799
You become that now they can feel your,

407
00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.239
they can feel your chakra.

408
00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.190
They can see what's wrong.

409
00:12:58.799 --> 00:12:58.960
You,

410
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.549
they are just like you to look at nothing,

411
00:13:00.559 --> 00:13:01.309
no difference.

412
00:13:02.409 --> 00:13:04.010
But inside they know,

413
00:13:04.020 --> 00:13:07.049
and you will also know because it is an actualization,

414
00:13:07.179 --> 00:13:11.690
not just talking a brain wave or just a sermon or sitting down giving a process.

415
00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:12.530
It is not.

416
00:13:12.619 --> 00:13:16.580
It is a happening that happens within you and when it happens,

417
00:13:16.619 --> 00:13:17.369
you become

418
00:13:20.099 --> 00:13:21.080
into some as collective consciousness.

419
00:13:21.219 --> 00:13:22.260
It happens.

420
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.599
Just become that,

421
00:13:24.690 --> 00:13:25.159
for example,

422
00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:26.510
see human beings,

423
00:13:26.849 --> 00:13:28.840
they are better than human animals.

424
00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.349
How,

425
00:13:29.719 --> 00:13:31.669
how do you know their their consciousness is better?

426
00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:32.190
For example,

427
00:13:32.239 --> 00:13:35.080
you take a dog to the field.

428
00:13:35.799 --> 00:13:36.900
It won't mind,

429
00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:38.739
but human beings will mind.

430
00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:41.989
A human being understands the be,

431
00:13:42.270 --> 00:13:43.859
the combination of colours

432
00:13:44.539 --> 00:13:45.270
a dog was not.

433
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:50.130
This is a different dimension that you have to reach.

434
00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:51.369
All of us have to reach.

435
00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.010
This is your evolutionary

436
00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:53.940
jump now.

437
00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:00.260
Where you become conscious of that all pervading power about which should be here.

438
00:14:01.330 --> 00:14:03.599
It is so dynamic you can't imagine.

439
00:14:04.409 --> 00:14:05.130
Sitting down here,

440
00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.650
you can feel somebody's vibration.

441
00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:09.309
You can cureus.

442
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:14.169
It is already built in,

443
00:14:14.309 --> 00:14:14.869
you see,

444
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.799
like I come outside and I can push the button,

445
00:14:17.809 --> 00:14:20.909
the whole thing can start working because it's all built in.

446
00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:25.010
It started from amoeba stage or even from the,

447
00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:28.820
you can say from the carbon stage even earlier when it was just

448
00:14:29.020 --> 00:14:30.650
just the power which

449
00:14:30.859 --> 00:14:33.609
got into many forms and now

450
00:14:34.179 --> 00:14:35.859
that is expressed through you.

451
00:14:41.570 --> 00:14:46.140
You go to another level of consciousness when you become collectively conscious,

452
00:14:46.190 --> 00:14:47.349
as I was telling Mr.

453
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:48.700
Maharaja the other day,

454
00:14:48.909 --> 00:14:50.780
that first you know yourself,

455
00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:52.179
you know your God.

456
00:14:52.549 --> 00:14:53.429
Without knowing yourself,

457
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:54.599
you cannot know God.

458
00:14:54.750 --> 00:14:55.549
Like without eyes,

459
00:14:55.590 --> 00:14:56.619
you cannot see the colour.

460
00:14:57.030 --> 00:15:00.630
You cannot know God without being in self-reli.

461
00:15:00.750 --> 00:15:01.729
If you go to a temple,

462
00:15:01.789 --> 00:15:02.190
what do you?

463
00:15:03.169 --> 00:15:03.960
You just do it.

464
00:15:06.080 --> 00:15:06.780
You have to become

465
00:15:08.809 --> 00:15:11.950
You whatever you may do in the name of God.

466
00:15:12.359 --> 00:15:14.320
God does not know you because you're not connected.

467
00:15:14.359 --> 00:15:15.929
It's like telephoning to somebody.

468
00:15:17.479 --> 00:15:17.900
Once

469
00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.059
your yourself is connected with God,

470
00:15:20.140 --> 00:15:21.530
then your own property,

471
00:15:21.559 --> 00:15:22.599
the some that you get.

472
00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:25.809
Now you are a capitalist when you get your support,

473
00:15:26.219 --> 00:15:27.179
then you have to distribute.

474
00:15:27.219 --> 00:15:28.520
If you do not distribute,

475
00:15:28.820 --> 00:15:29.460
you're not happy,

476
00:15:29.539 --> 00:15:32.140
so you become a real communist.

477
00:15:32.929 --> 00:15:35.229
There's no forcing about desert floors.

478
00:15:35.479 --> 00:15:36.280
You can't sleep.

479
00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:38.770
Like the sun,

480
00:15:38.890 --> 00:15:40.799
sun is the greatest communist you can think,

481
00:15:40.929 --> 00:15:42.440
but if it did you not have light,

482
00:15:42.690 --> 00:15:43.729
how can it be?

483
00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:47.690
And then you do not want any divorce,

484
00:15:48.130 --> 00:15:49.059
it just goes,

485
00:15:49.169 --> 00:15:50.010
it emits.

486
00:15:54.849 --> 00:15:58.840
I'm talking of that awareness which we have not yet gone into.

487
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:01.070
Shankaracharya has talked about it.

488
00:16:01.190 --> 00:16:02.469
Who has bothered about it?

489
00:16:02.549 --> 00:16:02.780
You see,

490
00:16:02.809 --> 00:16:04.500
our great politicians,

491
00:16:04.789 --> 00:16:06.619
I shouldn't say much against them,

492
00:16:07.179 --> 00:16:08.500
but what I'm trying to say,

493
00:16:08.630 --> 00:16:09.669
they are all English people.

494
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.039
We are more English than the English are,

495
00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:13.840
I can tell you.

496
00:16:15.979 --> 00:16:18.090
What we have to project is what we have.

497
00:16:19.549 --> 00:16:22.229
So our politicians cannot think

498
00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:25.309
that this is the thing we have got in our country,

499
00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:26.630
our spiritual heritage.

500
00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:28.599
Let us put this and manifest this.

501
00:16:32.609 --> 00:16:34.369
We will leave the whole world one day.

502
00:16:35.039 --> 00:16:35.549
If you get

503
00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:37.969
We are very big.

504
00:16:38.119 --> 00:16:38.880
You have no idea.

505
00:16:39.679 --> 00:16:39.840
I mean,

506
00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:41.000
you have no idea about yourself.

507
00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:43.619
Yeah

508
00:16:44.869 --> 00:16:46.890
And we are much happier people than them.

509
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:48.619
They have to learn from us.

510
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.359
They have finished their family lives.

511
00:16:51.400 --> 00:16:53.109
They have finished their societies.

512
00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.570
They are very unhappy.

513
00:16:54.799 --> 00:16:55.679
The richest country,

514
00:16:55.799 --> 00:16:56.260
Sweden,

515
00:16:56.349 --> 00:16:58.590
and the maximum number of suicides.

516
00:16:58.880 --> 00:17:01.109
And for your information in England,

517
00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:04.280
every week two children are killed by parents.

518
00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.089
Legal children are killed by their parents,

519
00:17:06.239 --> 00:17:07.000
mother or father.

520
00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.310
Can you think of such a thing?

521
00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:10.640
Yeah absolutely animals.

522
00:17:11.790 --> 00:17:13.348
Where are we developing?

523
00:17:14.098 --> 00:17:16.540
Why not short socket and bring them round also?

524
00:17:17.630 --> 00:17:19.339
That extremely unhappy people.

525
00:17:23.208 --> 00:17:25.218
And we have got this such a great thing,

526
00:17:25.519 --> 00:17:26.628
and I have got it here,

527
00:17:26.638 --> 00:17:27.108
you see,

528
00:17:27.198 --> 00:17:30.308
now in America I refuse to go there because

529
00:17:30.438 --> 00:17:32.519
the doctors there will immediately pick it up,

530
00:17:32.558 --> 00:17:33.068
you see,

531
00:17:33.239 --> 00:17:34.678
this is your thing,

532
00:17:34.798 --> 00:17:35.989
your heritage.

533
00:17:36.399 --> 00:17:37.029
You should have it.

534
00:17:37.198 --> 00:17:39.509
I have to teach them so they were all he,

535
00:17:39.519 --> 00:17:39.718
you see,

536
00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:41.649
knows French and he's from Switzerland.

537
00:17:41.838 --> 00:17:44.288
I had to teach him what is gonnaia who's sitting down here.

538
00:17:44.718 --> 00:17:45.909
He knows about fast

539
00:17:46.629 --> 00:17:47.438
because he's a car.

540
00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:49.300
But what about others?

541
00:17:49.479 --> 00:17:51.579
Ganesha is the same as Christ is.

542
00:17:51.989 --> 00:17:53.349
He's the same incarnation.

543
00:17:54.239 --> 00:17:55.339
It is Christ

544
00:17:55.790 --> 00:17:58.790
who is nothing else but Mahavishnu.

545
00:18:00.170 --> 00:18:01.920
I can prove it on the kunali.

546
00:18:02.800 --> 00:18:06.020
You can ask any absolute question once you realised you get

547
00:18:06.020 --> 00:18:08.349
the vibrations and you don't know whether it is that.

548
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.089
It is fantastic.

549
00:18:12.739 --> 00:18:13.189
But you see,

550
00:18:13.229 --> 00:18:14.430
I cannot have,

551
00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:14.939
uh,

552
00:18:14.949 --> 00:18:17.510
as you said that I can't have cheap popularity.

553
00:18:18.619 --> 00:18:18.969
You see,

554
00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:19.849
if I have pregnant,

555
00:18:20.010 --> 00:18:20.609
you will come to.

556
00:18:23.020 --> 00:18:25.280
And how can you charge money for such a thing?

557
00:18:25.290 --> 00:18:25.530
I mean,

558
00:18:25.569 --> 00:18:26.209
it's incentive,

559
00:18:26.290 --> 00:18:26.650
isn't it?

560
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:28.810
Even to think like that,

561
00:18:28.829 --> 00:18:30.030
you cannot purchase God.

562
00:18:32.619 --> 00:18:33.329
And it's nice.

563
00:18:33.390 --> 00:18:34.670
I don't have to have ashram now.

564
00:18:34.709 --> 00:18:36.099
I can always bring people to call.

565
00:18:37.359 --> 00:18:37.660
You see,

566
00:18:37.699 --> 00:18:39.540
you are a building an accident is a headache.

567
00:18:40.069 --> 00:18:41.180
Everything is a headache.

568
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:43.839
They wanted to have a son involvement.

569
00:18:44.010 --> 00:18:44.329
I said,

570
00:18:44.369 --> 00:18:46.369
I will agree to Ashram.

571
00:18:46.410 --> 00:18:46.699
You collect,

572
00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:49.369
but I don't need any money from them.

573
00:18:49.449 --> 00:18:51.069
And how can I take money from my children.

574
00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.439
But I said if you want to have for this,

575
00:18:55.180 --> 00:18:59.390
but one condition is that no black market money is doing off

576
00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.569
and 70 years they have tried,

577
00:19:01.699 --> 00:19:03.140
they cannot have.

578
00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:06.569
For such wretched sinful people,

579
00:19:06.689 --> 00:19:07.959
why should there be a

580
00:19:08.849 --> 00:19:09.339
Just

581
00:19:09.609 --> 00:19:10.319
not

582
00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:14.339
one person has offered us that Mataji had this place.

583
00:19:15.199 --> 00:19:17.390
But I don't mind giving money to this my yogi,

584
00:19:17.469 --> 00:19:18.579
this UV that yo,

585
00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.619
all those people.

586
00:19:19.630 --> 00:19:21.010
They have got loads of

587
00:19:21.599 --> 00:19:23.479
now this Rajnee is another fellow you must have.

588
00:19:23.910 --> 00:19:26.319
I don't know if I should mention it under your,

589
00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:27.300
uh,

590
00:19:27.310 --> 00:19:27.790
estate,

591
00:19:27.989 --> 00:19:29.800
but you know what sort of a man he is.

592
00:19:37.150 --> 00:19:42.430
can you tell us something about your and my education.

593
00:19:44.329 --> 00:19:45.479
I did medicine.

594
00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:45.869
I,

595
00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.189
you see,

596
00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:48.729
once I never needed an education as said,

597
00:19:48.910 --> 00:19:50.280
but I did medicine

598
00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.949
because I wanted to talk to doctors.

599
00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:53.260
I also studied psychology.

600
00:19:54.229 --> 00:19:55.109
And uh

601
00:19:55.780 --> 00:19:58.329
she's also a very well-known doctor and then

602
00:19:58.569 --> 00:19:59.560
she's also

603
00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.140
Was a professor of medicine.

604
00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.150
And the lady who have you now they are saying,

605
00:20:06.229 --> 00:20:08.020
the one whom they know about

606
00:20:08.510 --> 00:20:08.910
uh.

607
00:20:09.579 --> 00:20:10.199
In London,

608
00:20:10.319 --> 00:20:10.890
you see,

609
00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:12.229
her

610
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:13.839
husband was my profess.

611
00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:17.819
And he could not believe that this is so they cannot,

612
00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:18.170
you see,

613
00:20:18.199 --> 00:20:20.530
the scientists cannot believe that there is all permitted.

614
00:20:21.339 --> 00:20:22.660
What can scientists do?

615
00:20:22.780 --> 00:20:23.010
See,

616
00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.099
I don't blame them

617
00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.819
because if they see this is red,

618
00:20:25.859 --> 00:20:26.930
they say this is red.

619
00:20:27.619 --> 00:20:29.869
But supposing you have eyes

620
00:20:30.280 --> 00:20:33.479
like microscope to which you can see more than this.

621
00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:35.530
Then you can prove it to them.

622
00:20:35.650 --> 00:20:36.000
So I said,

623
00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:37.040
you take your realisation,

624
00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.079
then you can see this.

625
00:20:38.530 --> 00:20:39.750
Now they don't want to take.

626
00:20:40.329 --> 00:20:43.829
Now I cured this no doubt I've cured 100%.

627
00:20:43.930 --> 00:20:45.510
I've cured so many cancer patients,

628
00:20:45.530 --> 00:20:46.270
my disciples,

629
00:20:46.849 --> 00:20:50.619
and cancer cannot be proved by anything else but surgery.

630
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:51.969
Take it from me.

631
00:20:52.859 --> 00:20:54.060
It was born with me.

632
00:20:58.310 --> 00:21:00.400
So my background is that my father

633
00:21:00.670 --> 00:21:02.400
was a congressman,

634
00:21:02.510 --> 00:21:03.209
a very

635
00:21:04.079 --> 00:21:04.880
fellow congressman,

636
00:21:04.989 --> 00:21:08.430
and he also came to Kerala wants to do a lot of,

637
00:21:08.439 --> 00:21:08.619
uh,

638
00:21:09.989 --> 00:21:10.000
uh,

639
00:21:10.030 --> 00:21:10.750
for elections.

640
00:21:10.949 --> 00:21:12.219
He was a great speaker

641
00:21:12.630 --> 00:21:14.939
and also he was a member of the

642
00:21:15.449 --> 00:21:17.099
old central assembly

643
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.300
where there were only two from Madar Pradesh,

644
00:21:19.869 --> 00:21:22.609
and then he was the member of the constituent assembly,

645
00:21:22.910 --> 00:21:23.920
then of the parliament.

646
00:21:24.479 --> 00:21:25.160
And

647
00:21:25.329 --> 00:21:25.849
like that,

648
00:21:25.969 --> 00:21:26.969
I have a background.

649
00:21:27.130 --> 00:21:27.780
I myself,

650
00:21:27.890 --> 00:21:29.250
I have uh been

651
00:21:30.010 --> 00:21:31.619
tortured by Britishers

652
00:21:32.609 --> 00:21:38.329
and uh they have really tortured my life because in 1942 I took a very active part.

653
00:21:39.229 --> 00:21:39.810
And

654
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:44.270
actually we had to free it was important before getting free how we tested,

655
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:45.750
but as soon as we got freedom,

656
00:21:45.839 --> 00:21:46.959
you forgot that you are in.

657
00:21:47.859 --> 00:21:48.390
I want.

658
00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:53.119
You see,

659
00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.530
I have no bitterness about it.

660
00:21:54.839 --> 00:21:56.560
You'll be amazed the British today,

661
00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.670
the younger British,

662
00:21:57.839 --> 00:21:58.989
the younger people

663
00:21:59.239 --> 00:22:01.579
are very different from their fathers.

664
00:22:02.119 --> 00:22:05.040
They are such excellent people that in the foreigners,

665
00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:06.319
I would say they are the best.

666
00:22:07.199 --> 00:22:09.640
Because they do not have a shift in the nature of the Americans.

667
00:22:09.819 --> 00:22:11.439
Americans are doing only good shopping.

668
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:12.569
You see,

669
00:22:12.650 --> 00:22:13.560
they're very solid people.

670
00:22:13.689 --> 00:22:15.510
They don't take to surgery easily.

671
00:22:17.310 --> 00:22:18.380
They see and then they come to.

672
00:22:18.489 --> 00:22:18.760
You see,

673
00:22:18.770 --> 00:22:19.729
they are the most

674
00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.640
blessed people.

675
00:22:20.729 --> 00:22:21.089
I don't know,

676
00:22:21.130 --> 00:22:24.040
maybe they have got blessings of this country or whatever it is,

677
00:22:24.329 --> 00:22:25.650
but they're the most blessed people.

678
00:22:25.729 --> 00:22:28.329
They are the most balanced among all of them put together.

679
00:22:29.069 --> 00:22:30.550
And that's why my husband got

680
00:22:30.780 --> 00:22:31.410
elected,

681
00:22:31.540 --> 00:22:32.660
and that's how I'm there.

682
00:22:35.079 --> 00:22:36.699
So what more background you want to know?

683
00:22:36.810 --> 00:22:38.930
I have got 2 daughters and 4 grandchildren.

684
00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:43.530
And you know about my husband.

685
00:22:44.609 --> 00:22:44.650
Now what was it?

686
00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:44.670
No,

687
00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:44.699
who was,

688
00:22:54.229 --> 00:22:54.239
uh,

689
00:22:54.250 --> 00:22:54.310
I'mumata.

690
00:22:54.349 --> 00:22:56.709
Now who could be my room will tell every one of you is really to be very frank,

691
00:22:56.959 --> 00:22:58.219
because I have to understand about people

692
00:22:59.430 --> 00:22:59.709
through you,

693
00:22:59.719 --> 00:23:00.310
I understand.

694
00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:01.560
I really don't understand you.

695
00:23:02.540 --> 00:23:04.260
And all of these people,

696
00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:05.890
so I should say you are my.

697
00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.550
That's to be

698
00:23:10.300 --> 00:23:11.030
How old are you,

699
00:23:11.459 --> 00:23:11.479
uh,

700
00:23:11.540 --> 00:23:11.969
how young?

701
00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:14.989
I'm very old.

702
00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:16.920
I'm 40 I'm 56.

703
00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:21.260
I'm 57 now,

704
00:23:21.349 --> 00:23:21.780
yes.

705
00:23:23.569 --> 00:23:24.479
In terms of what?

706
00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:24.689
what?

707
00:23:26.329 --> 00:23:26.359
Well quite all

708
00:23:28.430 --> 00:23:29.949
Age has to be accepted,

709
00:23:29.989 --> 00:23:30.640
you see.

710
00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:32.180
Uh,

711
00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:32.869
even,

712
00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.189
even God has to be a normal person to talk.

713
00:23:36.010 --> 00:23:37.060
I have to become old.

714
00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:38.079
I have to just,

715
00:23:38.359 --> 00:23:39.589
I have to be just like you.

716
00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:43.260
I'm not here to show miracles.

717
00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.189
You have to be absolutely a normal person,

718
00:23:48.479 --> 00:23:49.890
absolutely a saman,

719
00:23:50.040 --> 00:23:50.680
just like you.

720
00:23:52.979 --> 00:23:54.709
So that you'll accept me much more.

721
00:23:57.959 --> 00:23:57.989
Not at all.

722
00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:58.079
It's all nonsense.

723
00:24:03.810 --> 00:24:05.040
It is just a show.

724
00:24:05.349 --> 00:24:06.280
What are you doing?

725
00:24:06.510 --> 00:24:06.699
You see,

726
00:24:06.709 --> 00:24:07.540
if you're wearing,

727
00:24:07.589 --> 00:24:07.959
say,

728
00:24:08.109 --> 00:24:08.520
uh,

729
00:24:08.589 --> 00:24:12.040
those dresses to show that advertising that Amazon.

730
00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:15.380
It's just happening within yourself.

731
00:24:15.630 --> 00:24:16.819
It's happening within yourself.

732
00:24:16.949 --> 00:24:17.300
Nothing.

733
00:24:17.469 --> 00:24:18.270
On the contrary,

734
00:24:18.349 --> 00:24:19.989
I bless all the families.

735
00:24:20.150 --> 00:24:21.750
Family is the most important.

736
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:26.910
And do you know there are some very great souls who want to be born in this

737
00:24:27.430 --> 00:24:27.790
country.

738
00:24:29.270 --> 00:24:29.900
Not anywhere.

739
00:24:30.229 --> 00:24:32.000
Why do we have overpopulation?

740
00:24:32.189 --> 00:24:33.229
Have you ever thought of it?

741
00:24:35.380 --> 00:24:38.040
We used to pray for fertility.

742
00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:39.380
We remember that

743
00:24:39.819 --> 00:24:40.569
a few years back.

744
00:24:41.369 --> 00:24:45.390
And why people are trying to be born here in England there is a recession.

745
00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:47.140
In Germany there's recession.

746
00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.849
People are giving money incentives to produce children.

747
00:24:50.180 --> 00:24:51.339
Children are not born there.

748
00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:54.089
In Sweden they're borrowing children from India

749
00:24:54.300 --> 00:24:57.660
and they're also going to Colombia and taking children with them or

750
00:24:57.819 --> 00:24:59.530
orphan children and all.

751
00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:01.160
Why are children are not born there?

752
00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:01.619
Why?

753
00:25:02.479 --> 00:25:05.839
Because this sensible man will be born in those wretched horrible conditions.

754
00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:07.810
There is.

755
00:25:09.449 --> 00:25:10.390
No sensible map.

756
00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.260
That's why we have to bear the load.

757
00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.930
Don't you be afraid of your co.

758
00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:17.709
I think they are more.

759
00:25:23.989 --> 00:25:24.150
Yes,

760
00:25:24.229 --> 00:25:26.250
they are no doubt you are correct there,

761
00:25:26.469 --> 00:25:28.219
but I still people don't,

762
00:25:28.430 --> 00:25:31.020
still people don't open their eyes.

763
00:25:31.510 --> 00:25:32.790
They do not have wisdom to see,

764
00:25:32.829 --> 00:25:33.339
you see,

765
00:25:33.630 --> 00:25:36.069
because they have a glow around them and they go

766
00:25:36.069 --> 00:25:38.310
with a big pomp and show and this and that.

767
00:25:38.430 --> 00:25:40.260
So people are so superficial

768
00:25:40.510 --> 00:25:41.319
they accept.

769
00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.209
Like I was telling about Rane in London,

770
00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:46.489
only 9 people started their show,

771
00:25:47.160 --> 00:25:48.650
and it's a very funny way they started,

772
00:25:48.790 --> 00:25:48.810
you know,

773
00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.959
basically they had no money,

774
00:25:50.189 --> 00:25:51.479
so they took out all their clothes,

775
00:25:51.760 --> 00:25:53.599
started dancing and shouting.

776
00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:55.160
Some people came round to see them.

777
00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:56.869
Now they have thousands.

778
00:25:57.199 --> 00:25:58.290
They don't know what to buy.

779
00:25:58.359 --> 00:26:00.079
They will buy the whole of London one day.

780
00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:02.180
But one simple thing

781
00:26:02.790 --> 00:26:03.859
in this respect,

782
00:26:03.989 --> 00:26:04.979
in this licence is.

783
00:26:06.619 --> 00:26:07.619
Why do they need a guru?

784
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:07.900
I mean,

785
00:26:07.939 --> 00:26:10.050
they can teach all of these gurus.

786
00:26:13.579 --> 00:26:15.420
There is no rising of the kundalina or anything.

787
00:26:15.459 --> 00:26:16.040
It's all happened.

788
00:26:16.739 --> 00:26:17.380
It's not rising,

789
00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:19.930
it's pulsation by becoming naked.

790
00:26:20.140 --> 00:26:21.489
If people can become

791
00:26:22.099 --> 00:26:22.290
realised,

792
00:26:22.579 --> 00:26:23.729
and I think in Kerala,

793
00:26:23.739 --> 00:26:24.739
half of the people who.

794
00:26:27.449 --> 00:26:28.270
It's all absurd,

795
00:26:28.349 --> 00:26:28.630
you see,

796
00:26:28.739 --> 00:26:30.989
you are intelligent people with a heritage.

797
00:26:33.619 --> 00:26:37.810
It's a silly thing that he's absolutely silly and foolish and he's a car.

798
00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:40.880
Is to insult the baby,

799
00:26:41.030 --> 00:26:42.319
to insult all the chest.

800
00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.140
He is the one who has taught people to,

801
00:26:45.390 --> 00:26:45.699
uh,

802
00:26:45.750 --> 00:26:46.390
absolutely.

803
00:26:47.630 --> 00:26:48.530
Converted

804
00:26:52.420 --> 00:26:54.020
We'll be shocked the kind of

805
00:26:54.239 --> 00:26:55.339
people live in that.

806
00:26:55.839 --> 00:26:57.109
You have no idea.

807
00:26:57.239 --> 00:26:58.089
These people,

808
00:26:58.359 --> 00:26:58.869
uh,

809
00:26:59.069 --> 00:27:00.189
cannot even tell you.

810
00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:00.560
I mean,

811
00:27:00.599 --> 00:27:03.000
you are too innocent to know what sort of people.

812
00:27:05.800 --> 00:27:06.949
If you don't give in the paper,

813
00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.000
then I'll tell you what,

814
00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:09.069
but don't give in the paper.

815
00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.300
It's too much shocking

816
00:27:10.969 --> 00:27:12.640
because we think oh they are very happy.

817
00:27:13.819 --> 00:27:16.680
There is a law in England and all over the Western country.

818
00:27:17.510 --> 00:27:18.119
That

819
00:27:18.369 --> 00:27:19.920
a man cannot

820
00:27:20.170 --> 00:27:21.319
sleep with his mother.

821
00:27:21.689 --> 00:27:24.010
Sleep with it doesn't mean the way we sleep with our mothers,

822
00:27:24.089 --> 00:27:24.500
but they did to me,

823
00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:26.890
and the daughter cannot sleep with her.

824
00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:28.760
There's a law.

825
00:27:28.859 --> 00:27:31.650
We don't have such a law that don't do dirty things,

826
00:27:32.900 --> 00:27:33.849
but they have a law.

827
00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:36.530
Now they are wanting to break that law,

828
00:27:36.569 --> 00:27:38.540
and there's a big procession at the parliament.

829
00:27:38.579 --> 00:27:41.369
I've seen with my own eyes in the BBC on the BBC.

830
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.250
They are demanding that this law should be

831
00:27:44.699 --> 00:27:46.650
broken and we should be allowed to enjoy it.

832
00:27:46.859 --> 00:27:47.150
Now,

833
00:27:47.180 --> 00:27:48.500
can you think of such a thing?

834
00:27:50.050 --> 00:27:51.810
With all your advancement.

835
00:27:53.290 --> 00:27:55.199
They are silly people,

836
00:27:55.569 --> 00:27:56.569
idiots,

837
00:27:56.650 --> 00:27:57.489
idiots.

838
00:27:58.239 --> 00:27:58.550
You see,

839
00:27:58.609 --> 00:28:00.469
with ego one becomes an 8.

840
00:28:00.949 --> 00:28:02.829
You must have read to see that's a ramara.

841
00:28:04.010 --> 00:28:06.050
In the rama they have shown how

842
00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:08.729
even Narada became an idiot.

843
00:28:08.739 --> 00:28:08.760
It is.

844
00:28:11.069 --> 00:28:13.089
So even Narada can become an idiot,

845
00:28:13.099 --> 00:28:14.880
but they are all idiots,

846
00:28:15.410 --> 00:28:16.989
absolutely idiot.

847
00:28:17.329 --> 00:28:18.729
You don't know how to talk to them.

848
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:21.540
Absolute idiots.

849
00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.109
What they have got.

850
00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.010
They haven't got even one cotton do that you have got.

851
00:28:28.199 --> 00:28:30.030
They have only plastics and nylons.

852
00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:34.719
Why do we need nylons for this nice planet of ours?

853
00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:37.160
God has given us such a beautiful planet.

854
00:28:37.319 --> 00:28:38.719
Why do we need so many clothes?

855
00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.030
Or we can live in a hut.

856
00:28:42.199 --> 00:28:44.719
Now they are coming and living here in heart and we want to have

857
00:28:45.709 --> 00:28:45.979
just.

858
00:28:55.239 --> 00:28:56.130
Now more questions

859
00:29:04.069 --> 00:29:04.390
You must,

860
00:29:04.469 --> 00:29:04.819
you must,

861
00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.829
all of you must ask because you see,

862
00:29:06.869 --> 00:29:07.310
I don't,

863
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:08.930
because intelligence is such,

864
00:29:08.989 --> 00:29:09.180
you see,

865
00:29:09.189 --> 00:29:10.469
it always ties back,

866
00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:12.619
but this is beyond intelligence.

867
00:29:12.829 --> 00:29:13.510
It's happening.

868
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.890
Supposing a seat.

869
00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:20.000
Is to be sprouted.

870
00:29:20.319 --> 00:29:22.030
What intelligence are you going to put there?

871
00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.839
It's a living process.

872
00:29:27.050 --> 00:29:28.160
You cannot do it

873
00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:29.079
by thinking.

874
00:29:30.770 --> 00:29:31.829
It is built in you,

875
00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:32.469
it will work.

876
00:29:36.510 --> 00:29:38.699
But here the people are very well educated

877
00:29:39.150 --> 00:29:39.989
in English.

878
00:29:41.609 --> 00:29:42.839
Not in Indian.

879
00:29:45.489 --> 00:29:45.550
It's a son.

880
00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.209
It's a big sun.

881
00:29:46.290 --> 00:29:47.099
Look at it or not.

882
00:29:47.949 --> 00:29:48.459
Jessie,

883
00:29:48.619 --> 00:29:50.319
not only he but all these,

884
00:29:50.819 --> 00:29:51.609
he's an Englishman.

885
00:29:51.739 --> 00:29:52.780
Now we have Philippa here.

886
00:29:52.819 --> 00:29:53.500
She's a great writer,

887
00:29:53.579 --> 00:29:54.939
but she's she's there.

888
00:29:55.369 --> 00:29:56.130
She's a writer anyway.

889
00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.229
Oh,

890
00:29:57.349 --> 00:29:58.469
they have sorted it out.

891
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:01.520
Once they have found the truth,

892
00:30:01.640 --> 00:30:02.589
they have sorted it out.

893
00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.119
All mark and they are all

894
00:30:04.839 --> 00:30:05.319
Shankara,

895
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:06.319
everything.

896
00:30:06.439 --> 00:30:09.010
Nobody did Shankarai who reads Shankara in our country,

897
00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:09.329
tell me.

898
00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:10.810
who is he,

899
00:30:10.819 --> 00:30:10.839
is he?

900
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:22.050
I mean,

901
00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:22.640
that would be very sad.

902
00:30:23.510 --> 00:30:23.540
So that really

903
00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:25.949
testing.

904
00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.819
How can people respect us?

905
00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.969
We don't know anything about our own motherland.

906
00:30:37.959 --> 00:30:39.949
So it is a that is not

907
00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:40.750
only

908
00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:41.839
the.

909
00:30:42.869 --> 00:30:44.719
You can see the evolutionary process,

910
00:30:44.989 --> 00:30:47.300
but by evolution you reach the reality.

911
00:30:48.060 --> 00:30:49.680
And it's a revolution,

912
00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:53.369
complete revolution is also a harmic religion,

913
00:30:53.540 --> 00:30:54.010
for example,

914
00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:54.810
in the temple.

915
00:30:56.209 --> 00:30:58.060
Not so much here in the north.

916
00:30:58.290 --> 00:30:59.689
What are these pundits doing

917
00:31:00.239 --> 00:31:00.880
horrible people,

918
00:31:00.969 --> 00:31:02.140
all of them have rues us.

919
00:31:03.650 --> 00:31:04.449
Sitting down

920
00:31:04.609 --> 00:31:06.000
and taking money from this person,

921
00:31:06.089 --> 00:31:06.560
that person,

922
00:31:06.569 --> 00:31:06.930
we want to.

923
00:31:08.109 --> 00:31:10.099
Where all these people walk all the way,

924
00:31:10.180 --> 00:31:13.719
you must have heard about this cult which the people go singing,

925
00:31:13.739 --> 00:31:17.250
walking for miles together for one month they walk and go to that temple,

926
00:31:17.339 --> 00:31:22.569
and there are these pundits called the uh that means the beaters.

927
00:31:22.839 --> 00:31:23.079
They,

928
00:31:23.339 --> 00:31:26.430
they really take the heads of people just like a coconut.

929
00:31:27.930 --> 00:31:28.380
Actually,

930
00:31:28.449 --> 00:31:29.099
like that,

931
00:31:29.670 --> 00:31:34.770
and they are minting money and they need such aa and such a wildlife.

932
00:31:36.819 --> 00:31:37.829
In the name of God,

933
00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.239
actually they are mammals,

934
00:31:39.319 --> 00:31:40.750
they are not human beings.

935
00:31:41.040 --> 00:31:42.750
So it's a revolution against them also

936
00:31:43.560 --> 00:31:44.920
to prove what are the mantras,

937
00:31:44.959 --> 00:31:46.109
to prove what are the deities,

938
00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.469
what is the reality.

939
00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:51.040
We have to get rid of all these nonsensical things which are sitting on our body.

940
00:31:52.290 --> 00:31:53.030
And on our.

941
00:31:56.170 --> 00:31:56.849
Who is the grandma

942
00:31:57.329 --> 00:31:58.969
is the one who has sought the grandma,

943
00:31:59.010 --> 00:31:59.890
the real realised so.

944
00:32:02.430 --> 00:32:03.510
Rahman is not born.

945
00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.900
And somebody told me that in the geeka I think who was the one who has written Gita.

946
00:32:11.150 --> 00:32:11.660
You know,

947
00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.000
Ria at least.

948
00:32:15.109 --> 00:32:17.900
He was a son of a

949
00:32:18.349 --> 00:32:18.790
fisher.

950
00:32:21.089 --> 00:32:22.339
That's too legitimate.

951
00:32:22.849 --> 00:32:25.010
How could you write that you can be born as a grey?

952
00:32:25.050 --> 00:32:25.609
You cannot.

953
00:32:26.469 --> 00:32:26.670
See,

954
00:32:26.750 --> 00:32:31.660
what we talked of the past was this the aptitude that you are a Brahmin by aptitude.

955
00:32:31.949 --> 00:32:33.910
That means you are seeking God in the Brahma.

956
00:32:34.859 --> 00:32:36.329
But the ones who are.

957
00:32:37.579 --> 00:32:41.800
Who are supposed to be chattis are the people who are seeking power for job.

958
00:32:43.819 --> 00:32:44.380
But joy,

959
00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:46.109
you can only get through this all conve

960
00:32:47.260 --> 00:32:48.609
through your own being,

961
00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:50.060
through your own spirit,

962
00:32:50.140 --> 00:32:50.780
which is the beginning.

963
00:32:52.089 --> 00:32:53.510
Which has to come into play,

964
00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:55.150
but when it comes into play,

965
00:32:55.319 --> 00:32:57.239
these vibrations start flowing,

966
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.199
which we call a state.

967
00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:01.280
They start flowing from like Christ has said,

968
00:33:01.319 --> 00:33:02.760
somebody touched his robe,

969
00:33:02.800 --> 00:33:04.859
and he said my energy has passed.

970
00:33:06.989 --> 00:33:08.599
What do they know these Christians,

971
00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.949
what do they know of Christ?

972
00:33:10.459 --> 00:33:12.589
Imagine this pope wearing all these big,

973
00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:14.189
big diamonds on top of his body.

974
00:33:14.319 --> 00:33:16.160
How many diamonds did Christ have?

975
00:33:19.530 --> 00:33:20.280
And in Colombia,

976
00:33:20.359 --> 00:33:22.150
I went down and I went to

977
00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:25.109
uh Chile and Argentina

978
00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:26.790
and foolishly they said,

979
00:33:26.959 --> 00:33:29.229
if Christ was not born a poor man,

980
00:33:29.359 --> 00:33:30.979
then he would have been more effective.

981
00:33:32.579 --> 00:33:33.170
How to talk

982
00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:39.750
see if Christ was.

983
00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:42.209
He is a rama.

984
00:33:43.569 --> 00:33:44.890
Those who are hanker of kings,

985
00:33:44.969 --> 00:33:46.130
how can they be kings?

986
00:33:50.219 --> 00:33:53.339
The king is satisfied so couple you make me sleep.

987
00:33:53.459 --> 00:33:55.270
I sleep if you make me sleep that I see.

988
00:33:58.479 --> 00:33:59.910
Such a person doesn't need it.

989
00:34:01.229 --> 00:34:02.709
How much do you need really?

990
00:34:10.059 --> 00:34:10.958
During the 7 days,

991
00:34:14.138 --> 00:34:14.368
See,

992
00:34:14.498 --> 00:34:15.858
whatever you want to do out of me,

993
00:34:15.898 --> 00:34:16.447
I'm here.

994
00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:17.978
And I will see you

995
00:34:19.228 --> 00:34:20.129
and I told Mr.

996
00:34:20.429 --> 00:34:23.208
rather that I would love to meet the villagers.

997
00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:25.409
And I'm for them.

998
00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:27.800
But here I come.

999
00:34:27.840 --> 00:34:28.958
It's a good thing in a way.

1000
00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:29.469
I,

1001
00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.790
I must praise your minister very much.

1002
00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.350
I met him for the first time,

1003
00:34:33.478 --> 00:34:34.918
but I liked him for one thing.

1004
00:34:34.958 --> 00:34:36.800
He's such a rare person.

1005
00:34:37.748 --> 00:34:38.467
Uh,

1006
00:34:38.868 --> 00:34:39.518
I mean,

1007
00:34:39.829 --> 00:34:40.378
to think,

1008
00:34:40.388 --> 00:34:41.299
he said that

1009
00:34:41.608 --> 00:34:44.819
this is the heritage of our mother,

1010
00:34:45.208 --> 00:34:47.208
Daruha many languages.

1011
00:34:47.868 --> 00:34:49.188
This is the heritage of mother.

1012
00:34:49.789 --> 00:34:52.299
We should project this instead of casinos.

1013
00:34:54.179 --> 00:34:54.260
See,

1014
00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:55.300
they have casinos.

1015
00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.610
They have ballroom dancing

1016
00:34:56.820 --> 00:34:57.840
much better than you have.

1017
00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:58.899
Actually,

1018
00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:00.659
nobody comes to India with that idea.

1019
00:35:00.739 --> 00:35:01.899
They come here for peace,

1020
00:35:01.979 --> 00:35:02.570
for peace,

1021
00:35:02.969 --> 00:35:04.209
about which they know

1022
00:35:04.500 --> 00:35:05.179
when they come here,

1023
00:35:05.219 --> 00:35:07.709
you give them cheap chairs and this and that.

1024
00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.419
They do not want you to ask all of them.

1025
00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.840
They come for peace and for relaxation.

1026
00:35:16.489 --> 00:35:20.070
And he said that that we should project this instead of projecting

1027
00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:22.489
uh their sort of nonsense.

1028
00:35:23.280 --> 00:35:25.080
That's why perhaps I'm in England,

1029
00:35:25.409 --> 00:35:26.669
because English can teach usur.

1030
00:35:28.090 --> 00:35:29.850
We won't learn it directly from it.

1031
00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:34.949
Is it so

1032
00:35:35.429 --> 00:35:36.899
that we have to learn some English?

1033
00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:42.590
Uh

1034
00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:45.209
thank you.

1035
00:35:47.469 --> 00:35:49.260
If you want to have experience or anything,

1036
00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:50.149
you can stay on.

1037
00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:51.219
I would like to see.

1038
00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:51.760
And moreover,

1039
00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.590
one more point I would like to see because Baji has

1040
00:35:54.590 --> 00:35:57.389
there that there is a village where people are suffering from.

1041
00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:03.610
There's all these things which we have to neutralise it.

1042
00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:05.580
How do you leave those things?

1043
00:36:05.659 --> 00:36:06.379
You neutralise it,

1044
00:36:06.689 --> 00:36:09.209
you neutralise you're not going to give up one thing

1045
00:36:17.469 --> 00:36:17.489
to another,

1046
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:17.649
but this is what our surgeons tangible.

1047
00:36:17.659 --> 00:36:17.669
Yes,

1048
00:36:17.679 --> 00:36:17.699
I know.

1049
00:36:17.709 --> 00:36:17.780
No,

1050
00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:17.939
no,

1051
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:18.100
no,

1052
00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:18.889
not at all.

1053
00:36:19.179 --> 00:36:21.540
Then you go from one extreme to another extreme,

1054
00:36:21.879 --> 00:36:22.090
you see,

1055
00:36:22.129 --> 00:36:23.600
you don't become politically,

1056
00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.169
but you be free within yourself.

1057
00:36:27.020 --> 00:36:29.090
Then you do not jump from one to another.

1058
00:36:29.429 --> 00:36:30.330
But then how can you win?

1059
00:36:30.459 --> 00:36:30.979
How can you win?

1060
00:36:31.060 --> 00:36:31.260
I mean,

1061
00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.399
people are not going to leave.

1062
00:36:33.419 --> 00:36:33.719
They will,

1063
00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:34.360
they will.

1064
00:36:34.570 --> 00:36:35.419
We can neutralise.

1065
00:36:35.459 --> 00:36:36.939
We are about to neutralise them.

1066
00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:38.439
They will,

1067
00:36:38.580 --> 00:36:38.860
you see,

1068
00:36:38.870 --> 00:36:43.199
the winning is which ways we have,

1069
00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:44.330
we have to have,

1070
00:36:44.340 --> 00:36:45.100
we will get them.

1071
00:36:46.239 --> 00:36:47.100
We will get that.

1072
00:36:47.179 --> 00:36:49.060
There are so many other ways we can work it out,

1073
00:36:49.139 --> 00:36:49.580
for example,

1074
00:36:49.699 --> 00:36:50.270
cancer.

1075
00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.889
You cannot cure cancer except through this.

1076
00:36:52.979 --> 00:36:54.620
You must get self realisation.

1077
00:36:54.939 --> 00:36:56.169
So all the cancer people,

1078
00:36:56.179 --> 00:36:57.020
let them come down.

1079
00:36:58.290 --> 00:36:59.300
We have a doctor here,

1080
00:36:59.320 --> 00:37:00.600
he's practising in London,

1081
00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:03.219
and now I've cured a doctor's wife

1082
00:37:03.719 --> 00:37:04.439
of cancer.

1083
00:37:05.570 --> 00:37:07.689
So they will have to accept this.

1084
00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:08.689
They will come,

1085
00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:09.899
they will come,

1086
00:37:09.979 --> 00:37:12.040
they will have to accept there are so many other ways

1087
00:37:12.419 --> 00:37:13.540
you can make them understand.

1088
00:37:15.330 --> 00:37:15.489
Well,

1089
00:37:15.610 --> 00:37:15.929
um,

1090
00:37:15.969 --> 00:37:16.629
do you have a,

1091
00:37:16.659 --> 00:37:19.239
a car in London because I got a lot of,

1092
00:37:19.370 --> 00:37:22.110
we had one lady working very hard in Tehran,

1093
00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:25.290
um,

1094
00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:25.350
but another branch.

1095
00:37:27.439 --> 00:37:27.449
And.

1096
00:37:29.070 --> 00:37:29.709
Like everybody else,

1097
00:37:29.790 --> 00:37:32.300
they're all refugees now and they're all in a bad state.

1098
00:37:32.350 --> 00:37:33.580
So if um

1099
00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:35.300
like you ask to get in touch with.

1100
00:37:36.489 --> 00:37:36.979
Just,

1101
00:37:36.989 --> 00:37:37.310
uh,

1102
00:37:37.409 --> 00:37:39.290
can you give me one of the things?

1103
00:37:39.330 --> 00:37:40.320
Have you got one?

1104
00:37:40.489 --> 00:37:44.520
You must have really given a very elaborate all our exhausted

1105
00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:48.560
so we'll send it over to you.

1106
00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.080
We have given in details all the things about this,

1107
00:37:52.270 --> 00:37:54.080
how is the mechanism within you,

1108
00:37:54.129 --> 00:37:55.399
the subtle mechanism,

1109
00:37:55.689 --> 00:37:58.280
how you get connected with the mains,

1110
00:37:58.290 --> 00:37:58.370
see.

1111
00:37:58.739 --> 00:38:01.260
How you are made and everything we have tried to

1112
00:38:01.260 --> 00:38:05.129
do it in short and in quite a concise way,

1113
00:38:05.179 --> 00:38:06.209
but we have given

1114
00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.669
quite good information about it

1115
00:38:09.020 --> 00:38:10.379
and please have a look at it.

1116
00:38:10.459 --> 00:38:11.570
What I think that

1117
00:38:11.820 --> 00:38:12.969
I would like to meet

1118
00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.179
the people of England

1119
00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.810
who are actually

1120
00:38:18.060 --> 00:38:20.429
sort of are they think they are in charge.

1121
00:38:21.219 --> 00:38:24.169
I would like to talk to them about it because these young people,

1122
00:38:24.379 --> 00:38:24.969
you see,

1123
00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:25.889
they,

1124
00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:26.610
uh,

1125
00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.469
they have no say.

1126
00:38:28.030 --> 00:38:29.580
But this is the problem why I say you,

1127
00:38:29.659 --> 00:38:33.409
you will end up going into politics because there's no way anybody in

1128
00:38:33.419 --> 00:38:37.929
in a western type that can do anything without having some game,

1129
00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:38.979
playing some game

1130
00:38:39.219 --> 00:38:41.719
to do it and to bring it to be recognised because the people are,

1131
00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:42.620
as you see,

1132
00:38:42.659 --> 00:38:44.919
prisoners of their material were in life,

1133
00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.540
and it blots out the problems at the moment

1134
00:38:47.540 --> 00:38:50.469
they're living lives to blot out from escapist lives,

1135
00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:52.340
to take people away from escapist lives,

1136
00:38:52.350 --> 00:38:53.350
you have to offer them

1137
00:38:53.659 --> 00:38:55.179
the most incredible inducement of all.

1138
00:38:55.560 --> 00:38:57.459
It's not like a backward country where you can,

1139
00:38:57.750 --> 00:38:59.229
you can like in Iran,

1140
00:38:59.310 --> 00:39:00.949
you've had first you have the Shah,

1141
00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:01.629
the monarchy,

1142
00:39:01.989 --> 00:39:02.510
the glory,

1143
00:39:02.629 --> 00:39:03.439
then suddenly

1144
00:39:03.590 --> 00:39:05.510
you had Islam the other way around.

1145
00:39:05.550 --> 00:39:07.590
But this is the only thing that would take away.

1146
00:39:07.870 --> 00:39:10.100
The Shah fell simply because he didn't understand

1147
00:39:11.429 --> 00:39:14.189
that Islam where they where they get all these people.

1148
00:39:15.350 --> 00:39:17.459
But I mean Englishmen are not concerned about that.

1149
00:39:17.830 --> 00:39:18.530
Englishmen are concerned,

1150
00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.959
I say about their football and television programmes and

1151
00:39:23.949 --> 00:39:23.979
and everything else,

1152
00:39:23.989 --> 00:39:24.870
life is too full,

1153
00:39:25.149 --> 00:39:27.320
so you have to slowly get things closed down

1154
00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:32.919
your government is making prohibition,

1155
00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.370
but I would say that your young people are.

1156
00:39:36.479 --> 00:39:36.860
You see,

1157
00:39:36.870 --> 00:39:38.939
to get into politics and this and that,

1158
00:39:40.469 --> 00:39:41.580
it's a good idea.

1159
00:39:41.790 --> 00:39:43.219
I have my attention on that,

1160
00:39:43.350 --> 00:39:45.719
but I would still say I have to prepare them.

1161
00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:51.699
They have to be something of a higher personality to impress on others.

1162
00:39:52.389 --> 00:39:54.459
If they have to be defiled like others,

1163
00:39:55.550 --> 00:39:56.429
I have to prepare it.

1164
00:39:56.510 --> 00:39:57.110
Can you imagine?

1165
00:39:57.120 --> 00:40:01.060
I worked only on 6 people for 4 years and now I have so many,

1166
00:40:01.229 --> 00:40:02.459
only on 6 people.

1167
00:40:02.469 --> 00:40:04.830
They were all hippies and taking drugs,

1168
00:40:04.909 --> 00:40:06.199
but now there are 300 people.

1169
00:40:06.879 --> 00:40:08.879
Who have given up drugs beautifully.

1170
00:40:10.159 --> 00:40:12.550
And they have had all kinds of experiences and everything.

1171
00:40:13.199 --> 00:40:14.669
So it is going to work out.

1172
00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:15.199
But I mean,

1173
00:40:15.239 --> 00:40:19.239
if you think that some people would be willing to do something because

1174
00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.370
You have to think that you could be the leaders tomorrow.

1175
00:40:23.709 --> 00:40:24.110
But I mean,

1176
00:40:24.239 --> 00:40:24.389
do,

1177
00:40:24.439 --> 00:40:24.870
do you have,

1178
00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:25.169
um,

1179
00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.610
I never see when I'm in a garden.

1180
00:40:26.719 --> 00:40:27.600
I never see any much on

1181
00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:29.360
yoga and related.

1182
00:40:30.199 --> 00:40:30.439
You see,

1183
00:40:30.449 --> 00:40:31.830
the trouble is we,

1184
00:40:31.879 --> 00:40:32.129
we have been

1185
00:40:33.179 --> 00:40:34.919
giving it in one yoga today,

1186
00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:38.199
one article with very big difficulty they've published.

1187
00:40:38.750 --> 00:40:41.290
And in the TV people they gave all kinds

1188
00:40:41.290 --> 00:40:44.489
of faith to such an importance and everything.

1189
00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:45.250
They even

1190
00:40:45.570 --> 00:40:48.830
uh had uh what you call this muktan and the pope,

1191
00:40:48.850 --> 00:40:51.250
but this nonsense and this horrible people,

1192
00:40:51.330 --> 00:40:51.800
you see.

1193
00:40:52.010 --> 00:40:54.850
I don't know why they make such a fuss out of these horrible people,

1194
00:40:54.929 --> 00:40:56.409
those who were ruining your young.

1195
00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:57.110
People

1196
00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:00.209
they have reached them completely made money out of them.

1197
00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:02.060
Why can't they see and they give them.

1198
00:41:02.139 --> 00:41:02.860
But for me,

1199
00:41:02.899 --> 00:41:03.149
you see,

1200
00:41:03.159 --> 00:41:07.860
somebody from India had one who was to be filmed and so she said,

1201
00:41:07.899 --> 00:41:08.659
why are you filming me,

1202
00:41:08.699 --> 00:41:11.929
you have got Matai who is the one who has given me all the power to do this.

1203
00:41:12.139 --> 00:41:12.500
So they said,

1204
00:41:12.540 --> 00:41:12.620
no,

1205
00:41:12.699 --> 00:41:12.770
no,

1206
00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.889
we have had many like that.

1207
00:41:13.899 --> 00:41:14.459
We don't want.

1208
00:41:15.510 --> 00:41:16.060
That's what

1209
00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:18.080
See,

1210
00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:20.879
it's very difficult now how to push forward things and

1211
00:41:21.159 --> 00:41:24.830
uh we have a neighbour who is a MP conservative MP who's staying there

1212
00:41:25.159 --> 00:41:25.860
and

1213
00:41:26.689 --> 00:41:28.689
You cannot just talk to him about it.

1214
00:41:28.760 --> 00:41:30.679
He's so mad with his politics.

1215
00:41:33.169 --> 00:41:33.199
I told you

1216
00:41:38.709 --> 00:41:38.760
that's your answer,

1217
00:41:38.780 --> 00:41:40.250
but I have to neutralise now you just give some

1218
00:41:41.040 --> 00:41:43.479
ideas to these boys how to neutralise them,

1219
00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:45.389
and I think we'll work it out.

1220
00:41:45.669 --> 00:41:46.360
We'll work it out.

1221
00:41:47.239 --> 00:41:47.840
You've been,

1222
00:41:47.919 --> 00:41:50.050
I'm sure they've gone by being,

1223
00:41:50.159 --> 00:41:50.709
I mean,

1224
00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:51.169
you know,

1225
00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:53.000
passive policies is no good to anybody.

1226
00:41:53.850 --> 00:41:56.530
Because even I mean even somebody like me who may be

1227
00:41:56.530 --> 00:41:59.139
reaching a point where I may need something very soon.

1228
00:41:59.489 --> 00:41:59.959
I mean,

1229
00:41:59.969 --> 00:42:00.560
uh,

1230
00:42:00.889 --> 00:42:01.669
you're much too,

1231
00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:02.260
how am I going,

1232
00:42:02.649 --> 00:42:03.679
anybody could get my attention,

1233
00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.409
it's impossible.

1234
00:42:05.479 --> 00:42:06.860
Very soon if I go back to England,

1235
00:42:06.939 --> 00:42:08.000
I would be immersed in

1236
00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:08.979
the racing,

1237
00:42:09.139 --> 00:42:09.540
football,

1238
00:42:09.550 --> 00:42:10.729
and everything else.

1239
00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:12.649
be too much bother to come to you.

1240
00:42:14.550 --> 00:42:16.419
You see this for them to think about.

1241
00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:20.879
Tehran was this was the problem you see Tehran,

1242
00:42:20.899 --> 00:42:21.780
they westernised too much

1243
00:42:23.239 --> 00:42:25.120
and they westernised so so much.

1244
00:42:28.270 --> 00:42:30.739
That kind of thing where if you can provide it,

1245
00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:32.580
there's no alternative,

1246
00:42:32.699 --> 00:42:35.379
but the point was that the leftists,

1247
00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:36.729
leftist Muslims.

1248
00:42:37.870 --> 00:42:37.879
Uh

1249
00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:39.870
just.

1250
00:42:42.709 --> 00:42:44.229
They really didn't believe them.

1251
00:42:45.120 --> 00:42:46.909
They are people who are.
