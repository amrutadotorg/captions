WEBVTT

05:37.860 --> 05:44.860
Today

06:02.300 --> 06:09.300
we have gathered here to do Guru puja. This
system started long time back in India, I

06:12.580 --> 06:19.580
think even at the time of Patanjali, maybe
even earlier, when there were great seekers.

06:24.860 --> 06:31.860
And their gurus were sitting in the jungles,
where they used to get permission to go there

06:34.750 --> 06:41.750
and then they would get their realisation,
very few of them, one or two. So we had many

06:41.770 --> 06:48.770
rishis and munis in the olden times in India.
So this system of guru started. Also one of

06:52.330 --> 06:59.330
the reasons is that, that there is no organised
religion in India. There’s no popes, there

07:02.139 --> 07:09.139
are no priests, nothing like them. They have
priests just for worshipping in the temples.

07:10.550 --> 07:17.550
But for giving realisation, for talking about
higher life, they all had to go to very great

07:23.949 --> 07:30.949
realised souls. And it was absolutely the
freedom of the guru, whom to accept whom not

07:33.000 --> 07:40.000
to accept. And everybody was tested thoroughly
by the guru if they are capable of achieving

07:43.849 --> 07:50.849
Self-realisation or not. And this test was
so hard, so difficult, and also to a point

07:55.949 --> 08:01.889
of cruelty, that very few could pass through
that test.

08:01.889 --> 08:08.889
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that. That,

08:09.300 --> 08:16.300
of course, made it a very narrow margin for
people to achieve their realisation and these

08:20.620 --> 08:26.560
gurus never used to leave their own seats,
they call it takiya (meaning: pillow). They

08:26.560 --> 08:32.360
would be there in their own place, all those
who would like to go to him could come. If

08:32.360 --> 08:39.360
he allowed, then only they can meet him. You
may go on for miles together, nothing, no

08:40.940 --> 08:47.940
obligations of the guru that he should meet
you. Perhaps they didn’t feel that love

08:53.230 --> 09:00.230
and compassion for the seekers. They didn’t
understand that the seekers are ardently seeking

09:04.130 --> 09:11.130
the truth and they should not suffer. That
may be the reason they were not so much concerned.

09:14.690 --> 09:21.690
All the time they were testing their disciple.
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,

09:23.829 --> 09:30.829
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,
though he was a born realised.

09:33.350 --> 09:39.970
So to get this Gurupada, to the position of
a guru, after that they had to work very,

09:39.970 --> 09:46.970
very hard to achieve a state of a saint. But
in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case, as you

09:52.810 --> 09:59.810
know. I just thought – if people get their
realisation, they’ll see for themselves

10:01.279 --> 10:08.279
what’s wrong with them, they will introspect
themselves and will try to correct themselves.

10:09.350 --> 10:16.350
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind and are

10:17.279 --> 10:22.540
going on and on and on thinking that they
are Sahaja Yogis, they have achieved a lot,

10:22.540 --> 10:29.540
they are something very special. So this delusion
is all the time is creating this problem.

10:31.540 --> 10:38.540
This delusion makes them very narrow minded,
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t

10:44.600 --> 10:51.089
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

10:51.089 --> 10:56.839
So the first and foremost thing we have to
know that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out

10:56.839 --> 11:03.839
because Paramchaitanya is transmitting compassion,
It never did before, It never had that kind

11:06.910 --> 11:13.910
of an attitude which it is there because I
am a Mother. And this compassion has worked

11:15.420 --> 11:22.420
it this way that: you all have got your realisation,
you have achieved a state which we can call

11:22.660 --> 11:29.660
as a Self-realised souls. But still, because
you got it so easily, cheaply, I think still

11:34.089 --> 11:41.089
we don’t realise what we have got. Still
we do not practice meditation, introspection

11:45.760 --> 11:52.760
and dedication. Some are very much there,
but mostly we are just living in the idea

11:54.949 --> 11:59.620
that we have already achieved.

11:59.620 --> 12:06.620
So, the first thing we should introspect:
Are we concerned about ourselves? All the

12:15.250 --> 12:22.250
time do we think that we are suffering, we
have this problem, that problem, or this should

12:22.300 --> 12:29.300
be done, that should be done. If the attention
is on that, that all the time you are worried

12:32.559 --> 12:39.559
about yourself, then you cannot break, you
cannot break through this shell of your being,

12:42.490 --> 12:49.490
which is under the domination of your mental
selfishness or self-centredness. Even self-centredness

12:53.670 --> 12:56.939
is absolutely against your growth.

12:56.939 --> 13:03.720
There are many people who come, I have seen,
even to Cabella, I know they have to suffer

13:03.720 --> 13:10.439
a lot because they think it’s a very open
space where they have to live and they must

13:10.439 --> 13:16.529
make all arrangements to make themselves comfortable.
Such people have to grow still much more.

13:16.529 --> 13:23.529
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

13:27.110 --> 13:33.770
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.
I have no demands of any kind. But if you

13:33.770 --> 13:40.770
are worried about your body comforts or your
body troubles then still you are at a body

13:42.850 --> 13:49.850
level, which you have to transcend. Worried
about how you look, how you dress up, what

13:53.319 --> 14:00.319
sort of things you have to wear: all this
makes you yet not a good Sahaja Yogi. This

14:08.630 --> 14:15.220
is one style of Sahaja Yogis who still want
very great comforts.

14:15.220 --> 14:22.220
So, what you have to do, if you are used to
comforts: try to go and sleep on the street.

14:26.500 --> 14:33.500
I will not do that, but you can do it. Or
sleep on a tree, you may fall down doesn’t

14:37.000 --> 14:44.000
matter (laughter). Do all kinds of things
that are necessary to punish your body to

14:45.600 --> 14:52.600
understand that you are not bound with this
comfort of the body. This is one of the greatest

14:55.220 --> 15:02.220
things one has to see, that you are not bound
by your body. It’s alright if you have comfort,

15:03.379 --> 15:09.339
well and good, if you don’t have, well and
good. For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important

15:09.339 --> 15:16.339
that he should be able to live like a saint.
Not necessarily that you should become a sanyasi,

15:18.420 --> 15:25.420
but from inside your body should be such that
you can dominate your body. How can you not

15:28.040 --> 15:33.300
sleep anywhere? Why can you not sleep anywhere?

15:33.300 --> 15:40.300
Then also, that they want to have a very comfortable
arrangements about bathrooms, this, that.

15:49.540 --> 15:56.100
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious but not superconsciousness,

15:56.100 --> 16:03.100
it’s not there. You want to have everything
first class, and anybody who tries to interfere

16:03.639 --> 16:09.519
with that kind of a thing, you don’t like
it. I can understand a person who is very

16:09.519 --> 16:16.519
old – he cannot manage things, he has to
have a certain amount of body comfort, but

16:19.189 --> 16:26.189
even young people these days are extremely
comfort-oriented. That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

16:32.189 --> 16:38.250
Of course I’ve seen people in the West are
better off in this matter. Because when they

16:38.250 --> 16:44.509
go to India they told Me they like [Maharashtra]
S.T. buses better than comfortable buses.

16:44.509 --> 16:51.470
So I said “Why?” “Because Mother, you
can jump in the bus nicely with all the luggage,”

16:51.470 --> 16:55.790
(due to lack of suspension and bumps in road)
“Because the windows are open, you can breathe.

16:55.790 --> 17:02.699
Very natural, very good“. And they wanted
to go on bullock carts also. I mean they enjoy

17:02.699 --> 17:03.920
all that.

17:03.920 --> 17:10.230
Actually if you see you’ll notice, in the
Western World mostly, people are taking to

17:10.230 --> 17:16.169
a more rustic life. They are enjoying more
the rustic style of life than to this so-called

17:16.169 --> 17:23.169
comfortable, artificial life. Not so much
Indians, I would say, also Malaysians. I think

17:25.770 --> 17:32.770
most of the people I have met in the Western
countries are really great because they can

17:33.480 --> 17:39.960
sleep anywhere, they can eat anything. You
ask them “How did you like the food?”

17:39.960 --> 17:46.960
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”
That is the sign. That is the sign of a person

17:48.770 --> 17:55.770
who is not bothered as to what he is eating,
what he’s getting, what is his taste, “I

17:56.690 --> 18:02.879
like this, I like that,” these words drop
out.

18:02.879 --> 18:09.879
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,
you might think that I am asking you to something,

18:12.570 --> 18:17.750
hazardous thing, you see. It’s not difficult
at all, because if you have to impress the

18:17.750 --> 18:24.750
people around you, you have to be like a saint.
And if you are a fussy person, if you are

18:25.679 --> 18:32.679
a fusspot, then you cannot impress others
that you have got Self-realisation.

18:34.220 --> 18:39.240
Many people tell Me “Mother, people had
to do so much: to go to Himalayas, do this,

18:39.240 --> 18:44.929
do that, and then they got their realisation.
How is it these people you have blessed?”

18:44.929 --> 18:51.929
Even some great saints asked Me that. “What
right they had to get their realisation? Why

18:52.230 --> 18:58.540
did you give them realisation? What have they
achieved?” I said “Only their desire.

18:58.540 --> 19:03.190
Their desire was very much there that they
should get their Self-realisation and that’s

19:03.190 --> 19:06.270
how they got it“.

19:06.270 --> 19:13.270
But now to go into only desire, is not sufficient.
You have to depend on yourself, on the light

19:18.429 --> 19:24.110
of your Spirit you should see what’s wrong
with you. This is a very important thing.

19:24.110 --> 19:31.110
Ask questions to yourself. “Why do I want
this? Why do I need this? What is the purpose?”

19:33.159 --> 19:39.830
Because as you have seen, all the rest of
the world is mad, [we] call it mad, because

19:39.830 --> 19:46.830
they are running after stupid things, they
are wanting things which has no meaning to

19:49.780 --> 19:51.389
spirituality.

19:51.389 --> 19:58.389
So spirituality itself should be self-satisfying.
If you are spiritually endowed, then you are

20:00.320 --> 20:07.320
self-satisfied. And this self-satisfaction
within you will lead you to that Ocean of

20:07.990 --> 20:14.990
Joy about which I have been telling you and
all the scriptures have described. For Sahaja

20:17.860 --> 20:24.860
Yogis, the word we use is nirananda. Nirananda
means: A joyous state, where nothing is needed.

20:26.860 --> 20:33.860
Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying only joy.
Nothing is needed to make you happy. You are

20:40.700 --> 20:47.700
happy because of joy that you have, in the
nirananda state.

20:48.220 --> 20:55.220
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed. How they managed their

20:56.120 --> 21:03.120
life, you’ll be very much amazed. How many
days they used to fast, without food. Never

21:03.899 --> 21:08.050
bothered! They never thought it was fasting.
They just used to think, “We have no food,

21:08.050 --> 21:14.690
so no, don’t eat.” Of course, you don’t
have to go through [that], you have got your

21:14.690 --> 21:21.690
realisation. So now you have a power to achieve
this mastery. Now, you have this power.

21:23.830 --> 21:30.830
The another thing I have noticed about Sahaja
Yogis, some of them have grudges about others.

21:34.129 --> 21:41.129
Sahaja Yoga is the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion. There is no place for any kind

21:53.460 --> 22:00.460
of hatred, or any kind of revenge, or anger
among Sahaja Yogis. If you have that, you

22:07.320 --> 22:14.320
must conquer it. Is a good chance, if you
find somebody who is very hot-tempered, who

22:16.600 --> 22:23.600
is a very angry type, go and make friends
with that person. Just see if you can carry

22:24.230 --> 22:31.230
on with that person or not. If there’s a
fusspot, also make friends with such a fusspot,

22:32.510 --> 22:39.510
and see that you achieve that peace which
will keep you above all kinds of hatred, all

22:43.630 --> 22:46.770
kinds of temper, which is a very bad thing.

22:46.770 --> 22:53.770
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper very
fast. I would say that they cannot be Sahaja

22:53.950 --> 23:00.950
Yogis, because if you have no control over
your anger, then how are you powerful of compassion

23:03.260 --> 23:10.260
and love? But you don’t even have to control
it – just there. Once you have it, or that

23:11.390 --> 23:18.390
state, then you just watch and see. In the
olden days, the saints ,mostly, used to be

23:20.950 --> 23:27.950
very much angry type people. They couldn’t
bear the stupidity of the world and they used

23:28.649 --> 23:34.190
to be very, very angry type and they used
to run away from people.

23:34.190 --> 23:41.190
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who always
lived on the tree, and anybody tried to come

23:42.080 --> 23:49.080
near him, he used to throw stones at. Couldn’t
bear the people who were all heated up and

23:50.539 --> 23:57.539
coming to him. But you don’t need that,
you have a way of achieving love and affection

23:59.059 --> 24:06.059
of the people who seem to be very, very troublesome
and grudging type or maybe some people who

24:07.610 --> 24:14.610
are very aggressive. This is not a difficult
task if you try a little bit the other way

24:15.220 --> 24:20.429
round. Mostly people, when they find somebody
who is a very hot-tempered person, they run

24:20.429 --> 24:27.429
away from them. They don’t want to have
anything to do [with them]. Those who are

24:27.690 --> 24:34.690
not hot-tempered, those who are good nature,
you can always be friendly, what is so great

24:35.690 --> 24:42.690
about it? What is so nice about it? What is
so sweet about it? But how you speak to the

24:54.850 --> 25:01.850
person, how you talk to that person, how you
manage that person: your love will definitely

25:02.990 --> 25:08.029
melt him down, because he’s a Sahaja Yogi,
I’m not saying for non-sahaja yogis. Sahaja

25:08.029 --> 25:15.029
Yogis as they are, you have to be extremely
compassionate and affectionate and love.

25:19.360 --> 25:26.360
Another thing which is extremely important
for us to know, that we have got this realisation

25:31.059 --> 25:38.059
through Mother’s love. Only My compassion
has acted, only the power of Mother’s compassion

25:38.820 --> 25:45.820
could have worked it out. Now, even if this
love is flowing towards the stones, or towards

25:47.500 --> 25:54.500
the mountains or towards anything which is
very solid, the ripples come back, they have

25:57.559 --> 26:04.559
to come back. In the same way, you people
now, who have got realisation, have to know

26:04.720 --> 26:11.720
that compassion and love is the only power
you have got, nothing else.

26:12.990 --> 26:19.990
If you love yourself, if you care for yourself,
you care for your family and care for your

26:21.679 --> 26:28.679
children – then you haven’t achieved much.
You’re only worried about yourself, because

26:30.309 --> 26:37.309
that’s your limited area where you move.
But if you can break that and find out places

26:42.230 --> 26:49.230
where you have to express your love, you can.
As they say, the water finds it’s own level.

26:52.559 --> 26:59.559
In the same way, this compassion has to flow
to all the places, to all the ditches everywhere,

27:00.640 --> 27:07.640
and should find its own level. But if you
are just satisfied with yourself and you are

27:08.179 --> 27:15.179
not bothered, you are just trying to believe
that you are a great soul because, you are

27:17.799 --> 27:24.799
a Sahaja Yogi, then I must say, that you are
sadly mistaken.

27:25.049 --> 27:32.049
In this lifetime, you can achieve that state.
In this lifetime, you can get to that state

27:35.299 --> 27:36.080
within yourself.

27:36.080 --> 27:43.080
Now, the third thing that troubles Sahaja
Yogis is that, “Mother we want God’s realisation,”

27:44.880 --> 27:51.880
that makes Me laugh. You see, it is already
there, already there. Like once you get into

27:54.510 --> 27:59.519
the sea and you say “Mother, we want to
go to the bottom of the sea,” you can always

27:59.519 --> 28:06.519
go, just slip, and you will be there. In the
same way, once you have developed a kind of

28:09.840 --> 28:16.840
a Self-realisation and have jumped into the
ocean of this compassion, there’s no need

28:17.570 --> 28:23.590
to achieve anything. The sense of achievement,
“I should be that, I should be this,”

28:23.590 --> 28:30.590
is all coming from your human haunting. That
should be over. Now you are Godly people.

28:31.559 --> 28:35.960
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

28:35.960 --> 28:42.370
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads and

28:42.370 --> 28:49.370
it will work out. This is what I have been
saying to you that: you have to dissolve yourself

28:50.870 --> 28:54.779
into the compassion.

28:54.779 --> 29:01.779
Also, there are still very people who want
to be in the front. Specially Indians will

29:04.309 --> 29:11.309
all sit together in front, I’ve seen that
way. They have no right, they have no right

29:13.390 --> 29:20.390
to sit in front. Nobody has right to sit in
front or to seek a place. They should sit

29:22.460 --> 29:29.460
wherever they get seat to sit down with complete
satisfaction. Whether you sit in front or

29:31.610 --> 29:38.610
at that corner, even in the darkness, you
can get My vibrations, you can get everything.

29:40.299 --> 29:47.299
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary. What

29:49.669 --> 29:56.669
is it in a prominence, what do you get? To
be lost into the crowds, to be lost into the

29:58.730 --> 30:05.730
Ocean of Love is the main thing. All these
are mythical that, we should somehow or other

30:08.090 --> 30:15.090
get the front place. You see as Marathi apan
manto (We say), “Samor chi zaaga patkauli

30:20.669 --> 30:27.669
mi!” means “I have managed to get the
front seat!” Front will be the back, and

30:28.659 --> 30:32.909
back will be the front.

30:32.909 --> 30:39.909
It is very surprising how still people are
trying to achieve something so nonsensical.

30:43.830 --> 30:50.070
So where is your mind, where is your attention,
what are you thinking? If you are thoughtless

30:50.070 --> 30:57.070
you will be satisfied, you will be happy,
you will not ask for anything, you’ll not

30:58.649 --> 31:05.649
want anything. What is there to have? What
is so important? All these ideas come from

31:08.789 --> 31:11.149
ignorance, I must tell you, from ignorance.

31:11.149 --> 31:18.149
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me. And he said that “We have heard

31:18.840 --> 31:24.980
you are a great saint, this thing, that thing,
and you have all the comforts of life – you

31:24.980 --> 31:31.980
have everything here, very nice, this thing,
that. So, how are you a saint?” I said “How

31:33.010 --> 31:40.010
are you a saint?” [He said] “I have given
up my family, I have given up my cars, I have

31:40.909 --> 31:47.909
given up my house, I have given up my children.”
I said “One more thing you have given up”,

31:51.380 --> 31:58.380
he said “What?” I said “Your brains!!”
(laughter and applause) So he said, “How

32:02.269 --> 32:08.409
do you say we have given up our brains?”
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up nothing,

32:08.409 --> 32:14.880
because I am holding nothing! What is there
to give up when you are not holding anything?

32:14.880 --> 32:21.880
Now, I would say in this house, or on my body,
anywhere, [if] you think you can find anything

32:22.720 --> 32:29.720
equal to the dust particle of Shri Krishna,
you can take it. Should be equal though.”

32:34.570 --> 32:40.399
Now they started looking here and there. I
said “Then what have you given up? Just

32:40.399 --> 32:47.120
stones? What have you given? Why are you boasting
about giving up that, and giving up this and

32:47.120 --> 32:52.860
giving up…?” They even shaved their head.

32:52.860 --> 32:59.590
All these useless ideas, that “We have done
this, we have done that.” Anybody in Sahaja

32:59.590 --> 33:02.990
Yoga who thinks he is doing a lot of work
for Sahaja Yoga, should give up completely!

33:02.990 --> 33:09.990
That’s the sign of another ignorance. If
you are part and parcel of the Ocean, everything

33:13.720 --> 33:20.720
is done by Ocean, you are doing nothing. To
have such ideas about yourself shows how little

33:23.730 --> 33:30.730
you know about your Self. You are the Ocean.
And if you are the Ocean how can you claim

33:31.600 --> 33:36.630
“I’ve touched this shore, I have touched
that shore, I have touched this shore“?

33:36.630 --> 33:43.630
No more “I” is left. Once this I-ness
drops out then only the Universal Being within

33:44.700 --> 33:49.100
you shines.

33:49.100 --> 33:56.100
All these things are so clearly evident in
our characters. Some people are very identified,

34:03.820 --> 34:10.820
say with their country, or maybe with their
worshipping style, whatever it is. All these

34:13.149 --> 34:20.149
mis-identifications have to be given up. It
is very difficult for people because they

34:20.159 --> 34:26.480
are so conditioned, and as long as you have
conditioning you cannot rise above your mind,

34:26.480 --> 34:33.480
which is a myth, you cannot. Now, try to understand,
what your conditionings are.

34:40.980 --> 34:47.950
One of them, I would say, I have seen and
I am so surprised, you go to the Western countries,

34:47.950 --> 34:54.950
all of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha. Shri

34:55.210 --> 35:00.940
Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also. And now I have

35:00.940 --> 35:07.410
seen that vibrations stop! Why should they
stop? Why should Ganesha stop the vibrations?

35:07.410 --> 35:13.390
Why they are doing it, I realised, was because
I said Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

35:13.390 --> 35:20.390
Their identification is with Christ and Christianity,
in a very subtle way. So all the vibrations

35:24.330 --> 35:31.330
stopped! Imagine with Shri Ganesha’s music,
we heard in one of the Eastern Block countries,

35:33.370 --> 35:38.970
and all the vibrations had stopped and they
were singing all the songs of Shri Ganesha

35:38.970 --> 35:45.970
and not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone
about the Guru, not once. So, even there is

35:50.910 --> 35:56.569
a very subtle identification.

35:56.569 --> 36:03.569
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed to
be very intelligent, he said that “Alright,

36:06.750 --> 36:13.240
if we keep Mother’s photograph and also
the icons, we can get the same type of vibrations.”

36:13.240 --> 36:20.240
You cannot, because icons are made by some
artist’s imaginary. These are not representing

36:22.630 --> 36:29.630
actually even Maria or Christ or anyone, they
are all imaginary. If Italian ones make Christ,

36:33.720 --> 36:40.720
he is Italian style, if some French one makes
it, he is thin like French, if you get somebody

36:44.420 --> 36:51.420
say from Holland, he will have a forehead
like that. You see all of them they depict

36:53.310 --> 37:00.310
Christ as they want to. Then we have Maria
the same way, Her expression, her photograph,

37:03.190 --> 37:10.190
everything, is all according to the imagination
of the artist and to whatever country he belongs,

37:11.670 --> 37:13.960
that he will do.

37:13.960 --> 37:18.920
And they are not free, you can see they are
not free, because all these artists have a

37:18.920 --> 37:25.920
certain style. Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s
a style, if it is, say Leonardo, it’s a

37:27.910 --> 37:33.740
style. Though they are born realised, still
they have a style. Nobody is like this, that

37:33.740 --> 37:40.740
he’ll make today like this, tomorrow like
that: there’s no freedom. They are bound

37:42.049 --> 37:49.049
by their own styles. Everybody has one style,
and that is the style they follow. Because,

37:50.430 --> 37:57.230
what is the reason, the reason is, they must
have done 3 or 4 types of styles, they must

37:57.230 --> 38:04.230
have done, surely, but people must have rejected,
“This is no good, this is no good,” so

38:05.850 --> 38:10.490
it is all the opinion of the people. So they
must have taken to one style: alright this

38:10.490 --> 38:12.390
is the style.

38:12.390 --> 38:19.390
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes, if he’s Chinese,

38:22.600 --> 38:29.600
he’ll have no nose, if it’s Indian, he’ll
be dark. So all kinds of Christs I have seen

38:33.359 --> 38:40.359
and I feel that, how can they emit vibrations?
Tell me. While with my photograph, how can

38:41.819 --> 38:48.529
you compare? Also, cameras were to be developed
at this time: do you notice that point? Cameras

38:48.529 --> 38:55.529
were developed at this time, not before that.
This loudspeaker was not developed before

38:57.850 --> 39:03.220
this. Aeroplanes were not developed before.
I have been travelling for 19 days, one day

39:03.220 --> 39:10.220
in the plane, second day in the public programme.
They could not do all that. Nobody could do

39:13.970 --> 39:20.970
this. Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone. They
could not fly by aeroplane in those days.

39:23.230 --> 39:28.650
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries” or go

39:28.650 --> 39:33.200
on correcting. But is only possible because
today, today: there are aeroplanes. They were

39:33.200 --> 39:38.190
never there [before].

39:38.190 --> 39:45.190
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there, was

39:47.520 --> 39:54.520
that available before? No. So this is a very
special time, where science has also supported

39:58.130 --> 40:04.670
seekers to find the Truth – science has
supported. We have to be thankful to science:

40:04.670 --> 40:10.850
that part of science which has been so much
supportive. Even [if] there was not a car,

40:10.850 --> 40:16.790
I could not have gone up to Milan even! Imagine
going on a bullock cart, what would have happened

40:16.790 --> 40:23.790
to Me? So all these things are created today
for you. You were also born in those times

40:30.819 --> 40:37.819
for the special reason. They could not give
realisation because that time you were not

40:38.109 --> 40:45.109
there. Very few people of your calibre were
there. But I wonder if you understand your

40:46.330 --> 40:46.750
calibre.

40:46.750 --> 40:53.750
The way you are sometimes growing, shows that
you don’t understand your calibre. You don’t

40:58.069 --> 41:05.069
know what you are, how much the whole atmosphere
has worked out for you, the science has been

41:07.049 --> 41:14.049
worked out for you. Science is a gift of the
nature. All this has been worked out for you

41:16.170 --> 41:23.170
to achieve the highest state in the shortest
time. But for that, one has to be extremely

41:27.940 --> 41:34.940
introspecting. Instead of thinking of what
you have to achieve: be introspective! This

41:38.009 --> 41:45.009
introspection will help you and you will really
become real gurus. When you go to other villages,

41:50.210 --> 41:56.670
other places, other cities, people should
know from your being itself that some great

41:56.670 --> 42:03.670
person has come. You don’t have to tell,
you don’t have to certify, it’s the simplicity

42:08.350 --> 42:12.299
of your temperament itself.

42:12.299 --> 42:19.299
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody knew
about Me. No advertisements, nothing, They

42:20.819 --> 42:27.819
just put some posters, some. And there were
2,000 people in the hall, 2,000 outside. In

42:29.810 --> 42:36.810
the hall they had to pay, alright. I was wondering
what’s the matter. And when I came out I

42:38.390 --> 42:43.710
gave them realisation but I said “You come
tomorrow“. So 2,000 from inside and 2,000

42:43.710 --> 42:50.710
from outside and about 2,000 more came, and
we were all sitting on the ground. I was amazed.

42:52.009 --> 42:59.009
I said “What made you come to my programme?”
[They] said “Mother, it’s so obvious,

43:01.520 --> 43:08.520
your photograph!” Such sensitivity of spirituality:
“So obvious, from your photograph!” And

43:10.790 --> 43:16.410
they were scientists, they were doctors, they
were all kinds of intelligent people. But

43:16.410 --> 43:23.410
they could feel the spirituality from the
face. That kind of a sensitivity we should

43:25.859 --> 43:30.620
have. When you don’t need any discretion,
nothing, you know: this is this, this is this,

43:30.620 --> 43:37.620
this is this. Don’t have to judge, don’t
have to think about it. You cannot say who

43:42.940 --> 43:49.940
will be best fitted for this: those who have
come for the first time, those who have come

43:50.359 --> 43:57.359
later on or those who will be coming, younger
or older, women, men or children. It is there.

44:00.949 --> 44:07.949
In my lifetime if I see so many of you, so
much transformed, looking so beautiful, so

44:10.609 --> 44:17.609
nice, creating such a good atmosphere. It’s
more than satisfaction for Me. And sometimes

44:19.420 --> 44:25.580
I think there is nothing to be done now anymore
– finished. But then they invite Me here,

44:25.580 --> 44:32.580
and invite Me there, so I’m just doing.
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

44:33.080 --> 44:39.109
Now, once you have planted the tree…it’s
like a mango tree. Once you have planted a

44:39.109 --> 44:45.009
mango tree and looked after it for 3 or 4
years, then it looks after itself. It gives

44:45.009 --> 44:52.009
fruits, it doesn’t need any water, nothing,
it just grows by itself. In the same way it

44:53.460 --> 45:00.460
should happen with you. You should grow by
yourself. Of course, you will find people

45:01.589 --> 45:08.589
who are stupid, who are aggressive, who are
not at all Sahaja Yogis and trying to be Sahaja

45:10.390 --> 45:17.390
Yogis. You’ll find all kinds. So just see
them, that’s all.

45:20.089 --> 45:27.089
In this Guru puja, you have to decide that
what are the criteria. First a Guru has to

45:35.569 --> 45:42.569
be without desires, any desires whatsoever:
nirichcha as they say. There is one false

45:47.609 --> 45:54.150
guru in India who said that ” If I had the
powers as Mother has, then I would have become

45:54.150 --> 46:01.150
the king of this world“. So people said
“Then why don’t you become?” Why doesn’t

46:02.219 --> 46:08.219
Mother become like that? Why doesn’t She
become the king?” So they said “Because

46:08.219 --> 46:12.020
She is nirichcha- means She has no desires.
A person who has no desires will not become

46:12.020 --> 46:18.420
anything.” So, I said go and tell him “If
you have desires, you cannot have powers also.”

46:18.420 --> 46:25.420
It’s only because you have no desires, that’s
why all these powers are there.

46:27.620 --> 46:34.620
So any desire that comes in your mind, you
should say “Forget it, just forget it.”

46:37.210 --> 46:44.210
When the desire is overpowering, you just
divert your attention. Any kind of stupid

46:47.400 --> 46:54.400
desire can take charge and how do you become
desireless is by getting to the thoughtless

46:59.150 --> 47:05.580
awareness. Any crisis comes in, you should
be able to rise into that state of thoughtless

47:05.580 --> 47:11.890
awareness. Just be peaceful. Look at your
desires with peace. You can tell the desire,

47:11.890 --> 47:18.890
“Oh, I’m very much satisfied, now don’t
come, I don’t want.” That’s how you

47:22.319 --> 47:29.319
can become desireless. There is this compassion,
and the compassion that becomes actually the

47:33.029 --> 47:40.029
power. [With] small, small things you can
express your love, very small, small things.

47:46.350 --> 47:53.350
In very sweet ways, you can express your love..
Is very important.

47:53.549 --> 48:00.549
The whole world needs today love and peace.
And you have to give peace and love to everyone

48:03.359 --> 48:09.890
that is possible. Of course [with] Sahaja
Yogis it is very easy, but even non Sahaja

48:09.890 --> 48:16.890
Yogis, you must treat them with respect and
love, but you should not have a desire that

48:18.779 --> 48:24.730
you should get back anything from them.
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

48:24.730 --> 48:30.549
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who came
to Sahaja Yoga have gained so much and have

48:30.549 --> 48:37.540
betrayed us – it doesn’t matter, it’s
not important. Because they are going to be

48:37.540 --> 48:44.540
losers, not we. So, there’s nothing to bother
about these things.

48:46.779 --> 48:53.779
Then another thing is: try to see that your
mind doesn’t react. Some people have a habit,

48:54.489 --> 49:01.150
or I think most of them have, to react. You
tell them something and they’ll put their

49:01.150 --> 49:08.150
own one tail with it, something. Never will
they accept if somebody says something. If

49:11.170 --> 49:16.549
you are reacting, what will go into your heads?
What will go into your heart? What will go

49:16.549 --> 49:23.549
into your attention?
So the reaction itself is a sign of not proper

49:25.819 --> 49:32.199
development within yourself. This attention
which is trying to go into all the areas of

49:32.199 --> 49:39.199
your mind and your body and everywhere, is
not there. It cannot enter, because as soon

49:41.670 --> 49:48.670
as it tries to enter, you shut it by reacting.
You cannot see anything just for seeing sake,

49:50.719 --> 49:57.719
you must react. You say “This is not good,
that’s not good.” If I say “It is 5

49:58.120 --> 50:05.120
o’clock” you’ll say “No! It is 5 past,
2 minutes, 3 seconds!” This comes with terrible

50:07.630 --> 50:14.630
conditioning which has to go away. Not to
react. Why should you react? Then the argument

50:18.600 --> 50:25.600
starts, then fight starts, then wars come
in. If you tell your mind, “Nothing doing,

50:27.069 --> 50:34.069
you are a myth and I am not going to react
to anything!” 99. 9% problems will be solved.

50:43.140 --> 50:50.140
Then the last, but not the least is the ego.
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,

50:51.839 --> 50:58.839
just can’t understand. It’s so stupid
to have ego. It’s a kind of a domination,

51:07.150 --> 51:14.150
if slightest things are wrong, you get angry.
If somebody says something, you get angry.

51:16.569 --> 51:23.569
That means your power of love and compassion
is still not full. You can of course correct

51:28.679 --> 51:35.370
people when they have to be corrected but
for that you should have this power within

51:35.370 --> 51:41.739
yourself. The person should know that you
are correcting that person because you love

51:41.739 --> 51:48.739
that person, not for selfishness, not for
any gain. But this ego is a very big problem

51:49.949 --> 51:56.949
and that comes up by, I should say, not only
ignorance but stupid ideas about yourself.

52:04.009 --> 52:11.009
If you think you are something great, already,
then what can you do? Ego makes you very arrogant,

52:16.370 --> 52:23.370
horrible. But if you are humble, really, not
to just to have the humility of a businessman,

52:23.640 --> 52:30.640
but if you are humble from within yourself,
from your heart, enjoying your humility, then

52:35.929 --> 52:38.679
this ego can run away.

52:38.679 --> 52:44.040
You have to ask yourself “Now what are you
angry for?” Again, I come back to the same

52:44.040 --> 52:51.040
point: introspection. Because you are not
here just to carry on some jobs, but you are

52:51.960 --> 52:58.960
here to become saints. Then this ego should
be made into a great instrument of love and

53:05.759 --> 53:12.759
joy. You can, it is not difficult. This one
is what is ego is, reactions to things. You

53:19.199 --> 53:26.199
can react to things in a sweet way or you
can react to things in a deadly way. Then

53:27.520 --> 53:34.520
the humour comes in. Also you speak as if
there is fragrant flowers which are coming

53:41.339 --> 53:48.339
out. Then every action of yours, everything
becomes very gentle and sweet. Have this ego

53:52.609 --> 53:59.609
that will be gentle, will be kind, will be
sweet, will be forgiving, will be loving.

53:59.880 --> 54:06.699
Let’s have this ego. Start with this kind
of a ego – the other way round. You’ll

54:06.699 --> 54:12.390
be surprised how you can really conquer the
whole world.

54:12.390 --> 54:19.390
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is supposed
to tell something to his disciples about correcting

54:21.660 --> 54:28.000
themselves. In my own sweet way I’ve said
to you which you shouldn’t mind. I don’t

54:28.000 --> 54:35.000
mean to condemn you by any chance but to give
you a proper sense of introspection, proper

54:35.469 --> 54:42.469
sense of introspection by which you all get
your gurupada. My only, I shouldn’t say

54:47.140 --> 54:54.140
desire, because I don’t have desire. So
my only vision is, that I should see all the

54:54.779 --> 55:01.779
Sahaja Yogis drenched in the power of love,
enjoying each others love, enjoying each others

55:05.509 --> 55:12.509
relationship, and improving relationships.
I know there are problematic people, I know

55:13.290 --> 55:20.290
they are problematic, but if you cannot solve
the problem what’s the use of your become

55:21.750 --> 55:22.679
masters?

55:22.679 --> 55:29.679
So, I leave it to you to solve your own problems
which you are facing, and introspection with

55:37.770 --> 55:44.770
love and compassion, not by condemning yourself.
I am sure you can manage it.

57:36.690 --> 57:43.690
May God bless you.
