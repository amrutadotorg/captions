00:01.825 --> 00:10.900
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

00:11.853 --> 00:18.848
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

00:19.049 --> 00:22.573
for all the humanity.

00:22.774 --> 00:29.089
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

00:29.289 --> 00:34.376
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

00:34.577 --> 00:39.797
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

00:44.016 --> 00:47.855
When this happened

00:51.683 --> 00:57.359
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

00:57.560 --> 01:03.012
because no one would understand Me,

01:03.213 --> 01:10.730
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

01:10.930 --> 01:16.549
to say something about Sahasrara.

01:18.339 --> 01:28.388
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

01:28.589 --> 01:36.979
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

01:37.180 --> 01:43.240
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

01:44.613 --> 01:53.399
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

01:56.301 --> 02:05.710
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

02:06.554 --> 02:10.725
and unless and until there are many lights,

02:10.926 --> 02:17.802
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

02:19.550 --> 02:23.407
It is a human error, also, all the time,

02:23.660 --> 02:30.854
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

02:31.054 --> 02:36.186
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

02:36.387 --> 02:39.874
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

02:40.075 --> 02:45.686
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

02:46.575 --> 02:51.534
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

02:51.734 --> 02:58.045
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

02:58.246 --> 03:02.533
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

03:03.560 --> 03:10.560
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

03:10.761 --> 03:15.329
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

03:15.530 --> 03:22.918
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

03:23.118 --> 03:32.185
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

03:32.386 --> 03:38.554
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

03:38.754 --> 03:45.648
Human level is moving on another plane

03:45.849 --> 03:50.881
and it has to come up to a higher plane

03:51.081 --> 03:57.416
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

03:58.953 --> 04:03.905
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

04:04.172 --> 04:10.718
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

04:11.136 --> 04:14.521
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

04:14.722 --> 04:18.062
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

04:18.263 --> 04:24.447
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

04:26.956 --> 04:35.988
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

04:36.189 --> 04:43.397
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

04:43.598 --> 04:49.702
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

04:49.903 --> 04:54.009
their fondness for things may be different,

04:54.210 --> 05:00.064
but inside they are all very beautiful.

05:01.816 --> 05:07.488
And this I found out, one after another.

05:07.689 --> 05:12.603
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

05:12.804 --> 05:20.086
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

05:21.004 --> 05:24.556
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

05:24.757 --> 05:27.794
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

05:27.995 --> 05:35.060
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

05:36.887 --> 05:44.762
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

05:46.377 --> 05:53.229
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

05:53.429 --> 05:58.671
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

05:58.871 --> 06:06.316
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

06:06.516 --> 06:14.770
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

06:14.969 --> 06:19.405
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

06:19.606 --> 06:22.792
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

06:22.993 --> 06:27.733
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

06:27.978 --> 06:33.246
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

06:34.262 --> 06:41.995
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

06:42.400 --> 06:51.274
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

06:54.140 --> 07:03.502
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

07:03.701 --> 07:10.819
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

07:11.286 --> 07:20.529
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

07:21.045 --> 07:32.434
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

07:33.215 --> 07:40.072
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

07:40.272 --> 07:45.341
which gave them sense of reality,

07:45.541 --> 07:52.019
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

07:53.618 --> 07:59.902
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

08:00.102 --> 08:06.485
I didn't say that it took Me long,

08:06.684 --> 08:11.152
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

08:11.353 --> 08:15.289
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

08:15.490 --> 08:22.155
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

08:22.356 --> 08:28.954
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

08:29.155 --> 08:33.803
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

08:34.003 --> 08:36.770
but only I felt that from human level

08:36.970 --> 08:43.776
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

08:43.975 --> 08:49.106
then some of that still lingers on,

08:49.306 --> 08:55.003
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

08:55.204 --> 09:02.695
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

09:03.274 --> 09:12.139
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

09:12.339 --> 09:16.748
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

09:16.948 --> 09:23.555
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

09:23.756 --> 09:29.363
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

09:29.563 --> 09:38.049
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

09:39.196 --> 09:45.017
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

09:45.217 --> 09:52.110
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

09:55.140 --> 10:02.511
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

10:02.711 --> 10:07.227
maybe it's your own understanding.

10:07.428 --> 10:13.978
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

10:14.178 --> 10:20.082
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

10:20.283 --> 10:25.245
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

10:25.446 --> 10:30.158
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

10:30.359 --> 10:36.587
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

10:36.787 --> 10:39.104
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

10:39.304 --> 10:44.771
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

10:44.971 --> 10:54.392
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

10:54.592 --> 11:02.104
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

11:03.379 --> 11:09.130
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

11:25.140 --> 11:30.943
When you feel responsible, you must know

11:31.144 --> 11:37.053
that you are not in charge, one thing.

11:37.262 --> 11:46.176
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

11:46.565 --> 11:56.349
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

11:58.195 --> 12:02.850
So to think that you are doing anything

12:03.050 --> 12:08.366
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

12:08.564 --> 12:14.008
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

12:14.209 --> 12:19.122
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

12:19.872 --> 12:23.629
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

12:23.829 --> 12:30.426
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

12:30.821 --> 12:38.530
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

12:38.747 --> 12:44.359
this great tree of spirituality within you.

12:44.595 --> 12:54.023
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

12:54.232 --> 13:02.646
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

13:03.760 --> 13:12.118
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

13:14.256 --> 13:18.396
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

13:18.597 --> 13:24.739
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

13:24.940 --> 13:28.416
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

13:28.616 --> 13:31.652
You are testing yourself, and now must know

13:31.852 --> 13:36.938
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

13:39.713 --> 13:43.208
where very few have entered.

13:53.426 --> 13:57.658
And there in that garden, when you enter,

13:58.015 --> 14:08.712
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

14:10.510 --> 14:16.459
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

14:17.117 --> 14:25.190
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

14:25.390 --> 14:29.625
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

14:29.825 --> 14:33.813
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

14:34.014 --> 14:40.181
that friendship, without any expectation.

14:41.336 --> 14:44.652
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

14:44.852 --> 14:50.462
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

14:50.662 --> 14:55.943
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

14:57.086 --> 15:01.807
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

15:02.007 --> 15:06.215
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

15:06.415 --> 15:11.977
or he's not doing much in life.

15:20.878 --> 15:24.745
This integration, this oneness,

15:24.946 --> 15:29.492
this feeling of identification with others

15:29.693 --> 15:35.984
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

15:38.841 --> 15:45.022
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

15:46.065 --> 15:51.036
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

15:51.236 --> 15:56.624
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

15:56.824 --> 16:01.809
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

16:02.256 --> 16:06.953
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

16:07.154 --> 16:12.534
but I've seen how it happens.

16:14.078 --> 16:21.193
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

16:21.393 --> 16:27.242
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

16:29.079 --> 16:31.776
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

16:31.976 --> 16:38.810
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

16:39.011 --> 16:43.486
Here then, you become absolutely humble

16:43.888 --> 16:48.205
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

16:49.665 --> 16:53.663
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

16:53.862 --> 16:58.776
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

16:59.828 --> 17:07.785
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

17:09.492 --> 17:14.601
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

17:15.530 --> 17:22.690
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

17:22.891 --> 17:28.758
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

17:29.198 --> 17:34.308
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

17:37.380 --> 17:42.494
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

17:42.927 --> 17:46.600
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

17:48.843 --> 17:58.796
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

17:59.505 --> 18:04.225
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

18:04.426 --> 18:08.484
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

18:11.155 --> 18:15.194
Such a flexible temperament you developed

18:15.395 --> 18:20.149
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

18:20.386 --> 18:24.999
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

18:25.200 --> 18:29.849
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

18:30.048 --> 18:37.050
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

18:37.251 --> 18:44.957
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

18:47.029 --> 18:52.881
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

18:53.082 --> 18:59.401
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

18:59.602 --> 19:03.999
to do this great job, to do that.

19:10.045 --> 19:19.058
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

19:20.157 --> 19:24.701
nor you should think that you are very
small.

19:26.658 --> 19:35.369
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

19:35.569 --> 19:44.661
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

19:44.861 --> 19:49.228
It could expand into anything,

19:50.302 --> 19:55.749
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

19:56.849 --> 20:04.816
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

20:06.015 --> 20:12.115
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

20:12.315 --> 20:18.340
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

20:18.540 --> 20:23.546
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

20:23.801 --> 20:30.492
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

20:31.956 --> 20:38.929
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

20:39.130 --> 20:44.940
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

20:45.139 --> 20:52.681
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

20:54.064 --> 20:57.202
I'll give you an example.

20:58.323 --> 21:04.807
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

21:05.008 --> 21:10.110
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

21:10.310 --> 21:14.276
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

21:14.476 --> 21:20.884
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

21:21.085 --> 21:25.886
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

21:27.195 --> 21:33.036
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

21:33.237 --> 21:36.969
and she couldn't move her fingers.

21:37.490 --> 21:42.594
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

21:42.794 --> 21:47.797
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

21:47.997 --> 21:52.594
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

21:52.794 --> 21:57.081
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

21:59.718 --> 22:02.413
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

22:02.614 --> 22:05.910
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

22:06.111 --> 22:08.774
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

22:08.974 --> 22:11.047
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

22:11.248 --> 22:14.712
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

22:14.990 --> 22:19.834
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

22:20.034 --> 22:23.610
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

22:23.811 --> 22:25.550
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

22:25.751 --> 22:30.667
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

22:30.867 --> 22:35.648
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

22:38.485 --> 22:41.543
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

22:41.744 --> 22:47.550
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

22:47.751 --> 22:52.032
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

22:52.231 --> 22:54.592
if you have to do that, it will work out.

22:54.753 --> 22:59.331
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

22:59.861 --> 23:03.257
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

23:03.458 --> 23:06.239
and who is not a realized soul.

23:06.439 --> 23:11.510
A realized soul person is not bothered

23:11.711 --> 23:18.877
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

23:20.146 --> 23:22.789
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

23:22.990 --> 23:29.252
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

23:33.688 --> 23:36.873
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

23:37.073 --> 23:41.595
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

23:41.796 --> 23:45.419
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

23:45.620 --> 23:48.508
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

23:48.709 --> 23:54.637
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

23:54.950 --> 23:59.133
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

23:59.334 --> 24:02.333
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

24:02.534 --> 24:07.360
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

24:07.560 --> 24:11.208
That you can live under any circumstances

24:11.408 --> 24:18.086
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

24:19.703 --> 24:24.997
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

24:28.184 --> 24:34.120
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

24:34.321 --> 24:37.274
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

24:37.474 --> 24:40.286
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

24:40.486 --> 24:44.356
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

24:44.556 --> 24:51.944
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

24:52.511 --> 24:57.115
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

24:57.315 --> 25:03.326
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

25:03.526 --> 25:12.370
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

25:12.841 --> 25:18.030
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

25:18.230 --> 25:24.365
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

25:24.759 --> 25:31.436
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

25:31.636 --> 25:39.825
If it can, it will, and also it tries

25:40.026 --> 25:48.465
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

25:49.088 --> 25:54.684
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

25:54.885 --> 26:00.102
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

26:00.911 --> 26:06.752
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

26:07.086 --> 26:15.720
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

26:18.153 --> 26:26.190
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

26:26.391 --> 26:32.622
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

26:32.823 --> 26:37.050
this Divine power, they cannot.

26:38.002 --> 26:42.403
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

26:42.604 --> 26:50.330
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

26:50.531 --> 26:56.692
and now you are just like great citizens

26:56.892 --> 27:04.212
of the great realm of divinity.

27:04.597 --> 27:10.808
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

27:11.776 --> 27:19.154
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

27:19.720 --> 27:29.635
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

27:30.135 --> 27:38.349
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

27:38.549 --> 27:44.333
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

27:44.533 --> 27:52.251
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

27:52.783 --> 27:58.907
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

27:59.088 --> 28:04.166
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

28:04.366 --> 28:09.627
But it never means that you should give up,

28:09.827 --> 28:15.391
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

28:15.592 --> 28:23.627
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

28:24.082 --> 28:28.108
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

28:28.308 --> 28:35.305
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

28:35.505 --> 28:41.581
or I do not earnestly want anything.

28:43.562 --> 28:48.216
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

28:49.080 --> 28:55.278
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

28:55.539 --> 29:00.788
You people are very differently made.

29:00.989 --> 29:04.262
Because you have achieved something.

29:14.487 --> 29:21.144
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

29:22.092 --> 29:24.860
Because you’ve achieved something,

29:25.061 --> 29:31.884
you know how you were and what you are now.

29:34.859 --> 29:42.944
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

29:44.321 --> 29:48.949
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

29:49.150 --> 29:54.260
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

29:54.461 --> 29:59.884
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

30:00.085 --> 30:08.475
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

30:08.959 --> 30:15.418
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

30:15.618 --> 30:21.076
You have crossed the bondage and now

30:21.277 --> 30:25.613
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

30:27.442 --> 30:34.371
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

30:34.571 --> 30:43.411
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

30:43.612 --> 30:47.421
then this lotus opens like this.

30:48.576 --> 30:53.599
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

30:55.294 --> 31:00.405
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

31:00.606 --> 31:07.055
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

31:07.256 --> 31:13.291
just like these, and they look like flames.

31:13.491 --> 31:20.106
But these flames are not with any heat,

31:20.306 --> 31:25.524
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

31:25.724 --> 31:33.023
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

31:34.715 --> 31:40.059
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

31:40.440 --> 31:47.933
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

31:50.254 --> 31:53.218
This is what has happened to you.

31:54.939 --> 32:00.624
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

32:03.042 --> 32:08.429
and there where we fail, sometimes,

32:08.723 --> 32:15.689
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

32:16.816 --> 32:24.674
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

32:24.875 --> 32:28.492
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

32:28.693 --> 32:37.615
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

32:43.310 --> 32:46.248
So you have to be,

32:54.141 --> 32:57.122
you have to be on the guard,

32:58.984 --> 33:04.694
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

33:06.099 --> 33:11.483
The first is ego, which how to attack,

33:11.684 --> 33:16.798
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

33:17.402 --> 33:20.580
that's the only vehicle.

33:24.873 --> 33:30.367
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

33:30.568 --> 33:35.090
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

33:37.046 --> 33:42.288
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

33:43.177 --> 33:49.211
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

33:51.509 --> 33:54.144
Why are you angry?

33:55.184 --> 34:00.271
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

34:00.472 --> 34:03.713
or to check someone? Why?

34:04.227 --> 34:06.996
The mind will not answer.

34:09.848 --> 34:13.213
The simple thing, if you can do,

34:13.414 --> 34:19.130
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

34:20.114 --> 34:26.707
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

34:29.076 --> 34:32.564
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

34:32.764 --> 34:35.891
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

34:36.092 --> 34:41.714
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

34:44.091 --> 34:47.892
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

34:48.093 --> 34:52.797
just know that you have to love that person.

34:55.531 --> 34:59.566
Now, how will you love that person?

34:59.766 --> 35:07.159
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

35:07.360 --> 35:12.750
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

35:14.754 --> 35:19.890
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

35:20.501 --> 35:26.061
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

35:26.261 --> 35:29.964
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

35:30.165 --> 35:34.374
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

35:34.590 --> 35:39.506
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

35:39.760 --> 35:42.470
Very amusing.

35:45.165 --> 35:49.697
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

35:49.897 --> 35:56.962
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

35:57.163 --> 36:00.950
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

36:01.151 --> 36:03.954
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

36:04.122 --> 36:05.234
makes no difference.

36:05.435 --> 36:10.678
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

36:10.879 --> 36:17.754
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

36:19.655 --> 36:23.186
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

36:23.387 --> 36:28.642
and that's the only source of her life,

36:28.843 --> 36:32.969
then I can understand why she is so upset.

36:39.149 --> 36:42.014
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

36:42.215 --> 36:46.334
very easily, it's not difficult,

36:46.826 --> 36:51.459
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

36:51.982 --> 37:01.128
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

37:02.108 --> 37:06.052
then what happens, you get understanding.

37:06.283 --> 37:12.690
Understanding of that person, you realize,

37:14.102 --> 37:17.712
as if identified with that person.

37:18.589 --> 37:23.415
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

37:23.616 --> 37:29.156
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

37:29.357 --> 37:34.042
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

37:34.242 --> 37:39.442
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

37:43.204 --> 37:49.188
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

37:49.389 --> 37:52.788
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

37:52.989 --> 37:57.755
The identification with another is very
important.

38:02.327 --> 38:07.888
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

38:09.130 --> 38:14.697
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

38:16.105 --> 38:23.054
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

38:23.254 --> 38:30.249
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

38:31.856 --> 38:42.957
This ego will immediately sucked in

38:43.158 --> 38:49.767
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

38:54.798 --> 38:59.547
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

39:00.880 --> 39:09.824
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

39:10.693 --> 39:14.404
Because you are a realized soul.

39:17.757 --> 39:21.867
Also, as I said,

39:23.974 --> 39:28.044
when you are identified with another
person,

39:28.640 --> 39:34.270
you put that person in charge of divinity -

39:40.004 --> 39:45.819
just a feeling of oneness.

39:48.842 --> 39:55.757
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

39:58.673 --> 40:04.985
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

40:05.186 --> 40:12.405
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

40:12.606 --> 40:17.030
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

40:17.231 --> 40:23.036
Not a saint, saint never says that.

40:23.949 --> 40:25.810
That time, when you say that,

40:26.011 --> 40:29.574
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

40:29.775 --> 40:32.129
For example, the one, now supposing

40:32.330 --> 40:37.547
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

40:39.035 --> 40:42.788
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

40:42.989 --> 40:47.965
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

40:52.485 --> 40:56.822
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

40:57.584 --> 41:00.626
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

41:00.827 --> 41:03.787
or the gentleman who has done it,

41:04.529 --> 41:08.934
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

41:09.585 --> 41:14.144
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

41:14.345 --> 41:17.051
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

41:17.252 --> 41:21.569
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

41:25.442 --> 41:29.065
Who are you to judge anyone?

41:34.490 --> 41:43.189
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

41:44.328 --> 41:51.405
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

41:51.606 --> 41:55.545
So why waste energy on judging others?

41:59.577 --> 42:05.438
We should see what is good in others,

42:07.363 --> 42:11.102
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

42:11.303 --> 42:13.819
everything first class.

42:16.111 --> 42:23.941
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

42:25.874 --> 42:30.672
You can watch, you can witness,

42:31.513 --> 42:37.007
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

42:37.208 --> 42:41.061
something that would upset others.

42:42.063 --> 42:44.977
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

42:45.178 --> 42:50.398
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

42:50.599 --> 42:54.234
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

42:54.435 --> 42:57.081
is just bubbling through that,

42:57.282 --> 43:02.062
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

43:02.263 --> 43:07.251
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

43:07.592 --> 43:10.317
You can be in the same position.

43:10.518 --> 43:13.064
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

43:13.264 --> 43:16.299
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

43:16.499 --> 43:21.103
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

43:21.587 --> 43:26.905
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

43:27.203 --> 43:31.285
you are too great to bother about these
things.

43:32.288 --> 43:38.406
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

43:38.607 --> 43:42.948
and just making yourselves small.

43:45.182 --> 43:51.664
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

43:51.865 --> 43:59.814
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

44:00.977 --> 44:06.682
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

44:08.289 --> 44:14.662
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

44:15.447 --> 44:19.388
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

44:21.035 --> 44:24.564
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

44:27.421 --> 44:31.740
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

44:37.006 --> 44:44.210
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

44:44.411 --> 44:47.762
what love I have expressed?

44:48.176 --> 44:53.119
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

44:54.071 --> 45:00.675
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

45:00.876 --> 45:04.733
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

45:04.933 --> 45:10.321
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

45:10.522 --> 45:17.049
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

45:17.346 --> 45:20.461
But what have you done

45:24.159 --> 45:28.413
in this realm of reality?

45:28.961 --> 45:32.738
Have you enjoyed the reality?

45:34.095 --> 45:44.636
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

45:47.672 --> 45:57.959
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

45:59.205 --> 46:04.841
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

46:05.042 --> 46:11.180
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

46:11.719 --> 46:20.466
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

46:22.396 --> 46:36.159
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

46:37.612 --> 46:42.104
So ugly this world has become.

46:43.652 --> 46:46.831
Can you beautify it?

46:49.502 --> 46:53.524
You can, because you can transform people.

46:53.725 --> 47:01.196
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

47:03.454 --> 47:09.982
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

47:11.117 --> 47:17.511
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

47:18.661 --> 47:25.858
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

47:26.059 --> 47:31.208
The another side is that we are still
identified

47:31.408 --> 47:35.868
with things which we should not have been
identified.

47:38.110 --> 47:40.941
We can just find out.

47:43.191 --> 47:52.804
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

47:55.784 --> 48:06.014
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

48:08.280 --> 48:12.229
All the fools, you see,

48:12.430 --> 48:18.989
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

48:19.190 --> 48:29.112
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

48:30.152 --> 48:33.770
God knows when it is going to collide.

48:34.302 --> 48:40.280
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

48:40.481 --> 48:44.311
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

48:44.512 --> 48:48.173
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

48:48.374 --> 48:52.444
come home and again quarrel and fight.

48:54.980 --> 48:59.030
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

48:59.411 --> 49:02.771
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

49:02.972 --> 49:06.973
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

49:07.174 --> 49:11.715
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

49:11.916 --> 49:15.806
and what happens to them? Nothing.

49:16.109 --> 49:20.716
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

49:20.917 --> 49:26.312
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

49:27.042 --> 49:32.283
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

49:35.937 --> 49:41.569
I've known so many people like that.

49:45.823 --> 49:54.332
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

49:54.533 --> 49:58.576
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

49:58.777 --> 50:04.173
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

50:04.374 --> 50:08.158
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

50:08.359 --> 50:14.581
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

50:15.748 --> 50:20.201
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

50:20.401 --> 50:23.613
everybody knew he's having a bath,

50:23.814 --> 50:30.090
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

50:30.291 --> 50:35.941
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

50:36.528 --> 50:39.037
and I heard something like,

50:39.238 --> 50:42.360
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

50:42.561 --> 50:45.616
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

50:45.817 --> 50:50.625
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

50:50.826 --> 50:54.940
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

50:55.141 --> 51:00.821
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

51:01.021 --> 51:08.809
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

51:09.009 --> 51:11.695
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

51:11.896 --> 51:17.026
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

51:18.720 --> 51:22.747
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

51:23.223 --> 51:26.962
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

51:27.163 --> 51:34.175
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

51:34.376 --> 51:43.576
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

51:44.274 --> 51:47.899
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

51:48.100 --> 51:54.737
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

51:55.785 --> 51:59.629
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

51:59.830 --> 52:05.180
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

52:05.381 --> 52:11.136
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

52:11.337 --> 52:18.770
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

52:19.484 --> 52:23.817
That kills the full experience of reality.

52:25.383 --> 52:30.643
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

52:30.844 --> 52:35.558
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

52:35.759 --> 52:38.557
morning till evening.

52:39.521 --> 52:41.773
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

52:41.974 --> 52:44.254
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

52:44.455 --> 52:47.555
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

52:47.756 --> 52:50.508
But we are not brainless people.

52:50.709 --> 52:55.719
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

52:56.434 --> 53:00.372
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

53:00.573 --> 53:04.288
or which are something, we don't.

53:06.868 --> 53:17.383
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

53:19.335 --> 53:26.440
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

53:27.623 --> 53:31.743
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

53:31.944 --> 53:35.021
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

53:35.222 --> 53:41.809
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

53:42.010 --> 53:49.420
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

53:51.263 --> 54:02.074
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

54:02.275 --> 54:09.896
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

54:11.718 --> 54:17.197
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

54:17.398 --> 54:23.214
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

54:23.415 --> 54:28.246
It's absolutely a flexible personality

54:28.447 --> 54:39.156
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

54:42.231 --> 54:49.144
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

54:50.699 --> 54:57.691
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

54:57.892 --> 55:06.580
that are facing us because of stupidity.

55:08.409 --> 55:12.619
This integration I'm sure will take place,

55:15.147 --> 55:23.494
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

55:24.010 --> 55:33.747
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

55:34.151 --> 55:37.141
It's going to happen.

55:37.720 --> 55:42.543
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

55:42.744 --> 55:48.625
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

55:48.826 --> 55:54.536
to truth and reality? It will.

55:55.108 --> 56:00.112
So today, on such an important day for us,

56:00.313 --> 56:06.881
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

56:07.082 --> 56:16.881
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

56:17.082 --> 56:23.168
light of compassion, light of love

56:25.196 --> 56:33.947
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

56:34.590 --> 56:42.461
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

56:43.326 --> 56:46.862
May God bless you.
