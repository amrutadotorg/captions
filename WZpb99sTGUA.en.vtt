00:00:01.825 --> 00:00:10.900
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:18.848
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

00:00:19.049 --> 00:00:22.573
for all the humanity.

00:00:22.774 --> 00:00:29.089
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.376
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

00:00:34.577 --> 00:00:39.797
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:47.855
When this happened

00:00:51.683 --> 00:00:57.359
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.012
because no one would understand Me,

00:01:03.213 --> 00:01:10.730
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.549
to say something about Sahasrara.

00:01:18.339 --> 00:01:28.388
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:36.979
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.240
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

00:01:44.613 --> 00:01:53.399
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

00:01:56.301 --> 00:02:05.710
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

00:02:06.554 --> 00:02:10.725
and unless and until there are many lights,

00:02:10.926 --> 00:02:17.802
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.407
It is a human error, also, all the time,

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.854
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

00:02:31.054 --> 00:02:36.186
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

00:02:36.387 --> 00:02:39.874
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

00:02:40.075 --> 00:02:45.686
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

00:02:46.575 --> 00:02:51.534
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

00:02:51.734 --> 00:02:58.045
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

00:02:58.246 --> 00:03:02.533
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:10.560
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

00:03:10.761 --> 00:03:15.329
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.918
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:32.185
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

00:03:32.386 --> 00:03:38.554
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

00:03:38.754 --> 00:03:45.648
Human level is moving on another plane

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:50.881
and it has to come up to a higher plane

00:03:51.081 --> 00:03:57.416
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

00:03:58.953 --> 00:04:03.905
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:10.718
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:11.136 --> 00:04:14.521
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

00:04:14.722 --> 00:04:18.062
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

00:04:18.263 --> 00:04:24.447
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

00:04:26.956 --> 00:04:35.988
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:43.397
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

00:04:43.598 --> 00:04:49.702
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

00:04:49.903 --> 00:04:54.009
their fondness for things may be different,

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:00.064
but inside they are all very beautiful.

00:05:01.816 --> 00:05:07.488
And this I found out, one after another.

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:12.603
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

00:05:12.804 --> 00:05:20.086
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

00:05:21.004 --> 00:05:24.556
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

00:05:24.757 --> 00:05:27.794
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:35.060
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:36.887 --> 00:05:44.762
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

00:05:46.377 --> 00:05:53.229
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:53.429 --> 00:05:58.671
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

00:05:58.871 --> 00:06:06.316
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

00:06:06.516 --> 00:06:14.770
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:19.405
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:22.792
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

00:06:22.993 --> 00:06:27.733
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

00:06:27.978 --> 00:06:33.246
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

00:06:34.262 --> 00:06:41.995
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:51.274
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:07:03.502
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

00:07:03.701 --> 00:07:10.819
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

00:07:11.286 --> 00:07:20.529
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

00:07:21.045 --> 00:07:32.434
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

00:07:33.215 --> 00:07:40.072
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

00:07:40.272 --> 00:07:45.341
which gave them sense of reality,

00:07:45.541 --> 00:07:52.019
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

00:07:53.618 --> 00:07:59.902
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

00:08:00.102 --> 00:08:06.485
I didn't say that it took Me long,

00:08:06.684 --> 00:08:11.152
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

00:08:11.353 --> 00:08:15.289
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:22.155
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

00:08:22.356 --> 00:08:28.954
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

00:08:29.155 --> 00:08:33.803
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

00:08:34.003 --> 00:08:36.770
but only I felt that from human level

00:08:36.970 --> 00:08:43.776
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

00:08:43.975 --> 00:08:49.106
then some of that still lingers on,

00:08:49.306 --> 00:08:55.003
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

00:08:55.204 --> 00:09:02.695
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

00:09:03.274 --> 00:09:12.139
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

00:09:12.339 --> 00:09:16.748
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:23.555
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

00:09:23.756 --> 00:09:29.363
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

00:09:29.563 --> 00:09:38.049
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

00:09:39.196 --> 00:09:45.017
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

00:09:45.217 --> 00:09:52.110
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

00:09:55.140 --> 00:10:02.511
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

00:10:02.711 --> 00:10:07.227
maybe it's your own understanding.

00:10:07.428 --> 00:10:13.978
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:14.178 --> 00:10:20.082
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

00:10:20.283 --> 00:10:25.245
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

00:10:25.446 --> 00:10:30.158
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

00:10:30.359 --> 00:10:36.587
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

00:10:36.787 --> 00:10:39.104
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

00:10:39.304 --> 00:10:44.771
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

00:10:44.971 --> 00:10:54.392
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

00:10:54.592 --> 00:11:02.104
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

00:11:03.379 --> 00:11:09.130
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:30.943
When you feel responsible, you must know

00:11:31.144 --> 00:11:37.053
that you are not in charge, one thing.

00:11:37.262 --> 00:11:46.176
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

00:11:46.565 --> 00:11:56.349
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

00:11:58.195 --> 00:12:02.850
So to think that you are doing anything

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:08.366
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

00:12:08.564 --> 00:12:14.008
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

00:12:14.209 --> 00:12:19.122
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

00:12:19.872 --> 00:12:23.629
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

00:12:23.829 --> 00:12:30.426
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

00:12:30.821 --> 00:12:38.530
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

00:12:38.747 --> 00:12:44.359
this great tree of spirituality within you.

00:12:44.595 --> 00:12:54.023
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

00:12:54.232 --> 00:13:02.646
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:12.118
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

00:13:14.256 --> 00:13:18.396
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

00:13:18.597 --> 00:13:24.739
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

00:13:24.940 --> 00:13:28.416
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

00:13:28.616 --> 00:13:31.652
You are testing yourself, and now must know

00:13:31.852 --> 00:13:36.938
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

00:13:39.713 --> 00:13:43.208
where very few have entered.

00:13:53.426 --> 00:13:57.658
And there in that garden, when you enter,

00:13:58.015 --> 00:14:08.712
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

00:14:10.510 --> 00:14:16.459
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

00:14:17.117 --> 00:14:25.190
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

00:14:25.390 --> 00:14:29.625
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

00:14:29.825 --> 00:14:33.813
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

00:14:34.014 --> 00:14:40.181
that friendship, without any expectation.

00:14:41.336 --> 00:14:44.652
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

00:14:44.852 --> 00:14:50.462
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

00:14:50.662 --> 00:14:55.943
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

00:14:57.086 --> 00:15:01.807
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

00:15:02.007 --> 00:15:06.215
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

00:15:06.415 --> 00:15:11.977
or he's not doing much in life.

00:15:20.878 --> 00:15:24.745
This integration, this oneness,

00:15:24.946 --> 00:15:29.492
this feeling of identification with others

00:15:29.693 --> 00:15:35.984
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

00:15:38.841 --> 00:15:45.022
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

00:15:46.065 --> 00:15:51.036
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

00:15:51.236 --> 00:15:56.624
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

00:15:56.824 --> 00:16:01.809
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:06.953
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

00:16:07.154 --> 00:16:12.534
but I've seen how it happens.

00:16:14.078 --> 00:16:21.193
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

00:16:21.393 --> 00:16:27.242
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

00:16:29.079 --> 00:16:31.776
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

00:16:31.976 --> 00:16:38.810
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

00:16:39.011 --> 00:16:43.486
Here then, you become absolutely humble

00:16:43.888 --> 00:16:48.205
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

00:16:49.665 --> 00:16:53.663
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

00:16:53.862 --> 00:16:58.776
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

00:16:59.828 --> 00:17:07.785
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

00:17:09.492 --> 00:17:14.601
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:22.690
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

00:17:22.891 --> 00:17:28.758
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

00:17:29.198 --> 00:17:34.308
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

00:17:37.380 --> 00:17:42.494
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

00:17:42.927 --> 00:17:46.600
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

00:17:48.843 --> 00:17:58.796
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

00:17:59.505 --> 00:18:04.225
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

00:18:04.426 --> 00:18:08.484
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

00:18:11.155 --> 00:18:15.194
Such a flexible temperament you developed

00:18:15.395 --> 00:18:20.149
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

00:18:20.386 --> 00:18:24.999
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.849
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

00:18:30.048 --> 00:18:37.050
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

00:18:37.251 --> 00:18:44.957
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

00:18:47.029 --> 00:18:52.881
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

00:18:53.082 --> 00:18:59.401
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

00:18:59.602 --> 00:19:03.999
to do this great job, to do that.

00:19:10.045 --> 00:19:19.058
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

00:19:20.157 --> 00:19:24.701
nor you should think that you are very
small.

00:19:26.658 --> 00:19:35.369
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

00:19:35.569 --> 00:19:44.661
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

00:19:44.861 --> 00:19:49.228
It could expand into anything,

00:19:50.302 --> 00:19:55.749
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

00:19:56.849 --> 00:20:04.816
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

00:20:06.015 --> 00:20:12.115
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

00:20:12.315 --> 00:20:18.340
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:23.546
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

00:20:23.801 --> 00:20:30.492
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

00:20:31.956 --> 00:20:38.929
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

00:20:39.130 --> 00:20:44.940
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

00:20:45.139 --> 00:20:52.681
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

00:20:54.064 --> 00:20:57.202
I'll give you an example.

00:20:58.323 --> 00:21:04.807
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

00:21:05.008 --> 00:21:10.110
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

00:21:10.310 --> 00:21:14.276
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

00:21:14.476 --> 00:21:20.884
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

00:21:21.085 --> 00:21:25.886
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

00:21:27.195 --> 00:21:33.036
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

00:21:33.237 --> 00:21:36.969
and she couldn't move her fingers.

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:42.594
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

00:21:42.794 --> 00:21:47.797
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

00:21:47.997 --> 00:21:52.594
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

00:21:52.794 --> 00:21:57.081
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:02.413
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

00:22:02.614 --> 00:22:05.910
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

00:22:06.111 --> 00:22:08.774
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

00:22:08.974 --> 00:22:11.047
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

00:22:11.248 --> 00:22:14.712
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:19.834
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

00:22:20.034 --> 00:22:23.610
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

00:22:23.811 --> 00:22:25.550
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

00:22:25.751 --> 00:22:30.667
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:35.648
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

00:22:38.485 --> 00:22:41.543
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

00:22:41.744 --> 00:22:47.550
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

00:22:47.751 --> 00:22:52.032
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

00:22:52.231 --> 00:22:54.592
if you have to do that, it will work out.

00:22:54.753 --> 00:22:59.331
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

00:22:59.861 --> 00:23:03.257
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

00:23:03.458 --> 00:23:06.239
and who is not a realized soul.

00:23:06.439 --> 00:23:11.510
A realized soul person is not bothered

00:23:11.711 --> 00:23:18.877
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

00:23:20.146 --> 00:23:22.789
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

00:23:22.990 --> 00:23:29.252
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

00:23:33.688 --> 00:23:36.873
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

00:23:37.073 --> 00:23:41.595
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

00:23:41.796 --> 00:23:45.419
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:48.508
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

00:23:48.709 --> 00:23:54.637
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

00:23:54.950 --> 00:23:59.133
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

00:23:59.334 --> 00:24:02.333
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

00:24:02.534 --> 00:24:07.360
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:11.208
That you can live under any circumstances

00:24:11.408 --> 00:24:18.086
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

00:24:19.703 --> 00:24:24.997
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

00:24:28.184 --> 00:24:34.120
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

00:24:34.321 --> 00:24:37.274
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

00:24:37.474 --> 00:24:40.286
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

00:24:40.486 --> 00:24:44.356
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

00:24:44.556 --> 00:24:51.944
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

00:24:52.511 --> 00:24:57.115
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

00:24:57.315 --> 00:25:03.326
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

00:25:03.526 --> 00:25:12.370
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

00:25:12.841 --> 00:25:18.030
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

00:25:18.230 --> 00:25:24.365
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

00:25:24.759 --> 00:25:31.436
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

00:25:31.636 --> 00:25:39.825
If it can, it will, and also it tries

00:25:40.026 --> 00:25:48.465
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

00:25:49.088 --> 00:25:54.684
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

00:25:54.885 --> 00:26:00.102
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

00:26:00.911 --> 00:26:06.752
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

00:26:07.086 --> 00:26:15.720
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

00:26:18.153 --> 00:26:26.190
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

00:26:26.391 --> 00:26:32.622
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

00:26:32.823 --> 00:26:37.050
this Divine power, they cannot.

00:26:38.002 --> 00:26:42.403
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

00:26:42.604 --> 00:26:50.330
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

00:26:50.531 --> 00:26:56.692
and now you are just like great citizens

00:26:56.892 --> 00:27:04.212
of the great realm of divinity.

00:27:04.597 --> 00:27:10.808
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

00:27:11.776 --> 00:27:19.154
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:29.635
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

00:27:30.135 --> 00:27:38.349
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

00:27:38.549 --> 00:27:44.333
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

00:27:44.533 --> 00:27:52.251
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

00:27:52.783 --> 00:27:58.907
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

00:27:59.088 --> 00:28:04.166
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

00:28:04.366 --> 00:28:09.627
But it never means that you should give up,

00:28:09.827 --> 00:28:15.391
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

00:28:15.592 --> 00:28:23.627
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

00:28:24.082 --> 00:28:28.108
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

00:28:28.308 --> 00:28:35.305
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

00:28:35.505 --> 00:28:41.581
or I do not earnestly want anything.

00:28:43.562 --> 00:28:48.216
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:55.278
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

00:28:55.539 --> 00:29:00.788
You people are very differently made.

00:29:00.989 --> 00:29:04.262
Because you have achieved something.

00:29:14.487 --> 00:29:21.144
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

00:29:22.092 --> 00:29:24.860
Because you’ve achieved something,

00:29:25.061 --> 00:29:31.884
you know how you were and what you are now.

00:29:34.859 --> 00:29:42.944
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

00:29:44.321 --> 00:29:48.949
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:54.260
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

00:29:54.461 --> 00:29:59.884
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

00:30:00.085 --> 00:30:08.475
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

00:30:08.959 --> 00:30:15.418
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

00:30:15.618 --> 00:30:21.076
You have crossed the bondage and now

00:30:21.277 --> 00:30:25.613
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

00:30:27.442 --> 00:30:34.371
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

00:30:34.571 --> 00:30:43.411
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

00:30:43.612 --> 00:30:47.421
then this lotus opens like this.

00:30:48.576 --> 00:30:53.599
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

00:30:55.294 --> 00:31:00.405
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

00:31:00.606 --> 00:31:07.055
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

00:31:07.256 --> 00:31:13.291
just like these, and they look like flames.

00:31:13.491 --> 00:31:20.106
But these flames are not with any heat,

00:31:20.306 --> 00:31:25.524
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

00:31:25.724 --> 00:31:33.023
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

00:31:34.715 --> 00:31:40.059
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.933
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

00:31:50.254 --> 00:31:53.218
This is what has happened to you.

00:31:54.939 --> 00:32:00.624
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

00:32:03.042 --> 00:32:08.429
and there where we fail, sometimes,

00:32:08.723 --> 00:32:15.689
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

00:32:16.816 --> 00:32:24.674
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

00:32:24.875 --> 00:32:28.492
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

00:32:28.693 --> 00:32:37.615
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

00:32:43.310 --> 00:32:46.248
So you have to be,

00:32:54.141 --> 00:32:57.122
you have to be on the guard,

00:32:58.984 --> 00:33:04.694
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

00:33:06.099 --> 00:33:11.483
The first is ego, which how to attack,

00:33:11.684 --> 00:33:16.798
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

00:33:17.402 --> 00:33:20.580
that's the only vehicle.

00:33:24.873 --> 00:33:30.367
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

00:33:30.568 --> 00:33:35.090
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

00:33:37.046 --> 00:33:42.288
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

00:33:43.177 --> 00:33:49.211
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

00:33:51.509 --> 00:33:54.144
Why are you angry?

00:33:55.184 --> 00:34:00.271
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

00:34:00.472 --> 00:34:03.713
or to check someone? Why?

00:34:04.227 --> 00:34:06.996
The mind will not answer.

00:34:09.848 --> 00:34:13.213
The simple thing, if you can do,

00:34:13.414 --> 00:34:19.130
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

00:34:20.114 --> 00:34:26.707
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

00:34:29.076 --> 00:34:32.564
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

00:34:32.764 --> 00:34:35.891
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

00:34:36.092 --> 00:34:41.714
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

00:34:44.091 --> 00:34:47.892
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

00:34:48.093 --> 00:34:52.797
just know that you have to love that person.

00:34:55.531 --> 00:34:59.566
Now, how will you love that person?

00:34:59.766 --> 00:35:07.159
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

00:35:07.360 --> 00:35:12.750
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

00:35:14.754 --> 00:35:19.890
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

00:35:20.501 --> 00:35:26.061
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

00:35:26.261 --> 00:35:29.964
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

00:35:30.165 --> 00:35:34.374
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

00:35:34.590 --> 00:35:39.506
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:42.470
Very amusing.

00:35:45.165 --> 00:35:49.697
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

00:35:49.897 --> 00:35:56.962
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

00:35:57.163 --> 00:36:00.950
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

00:36:01.151 --> 00:36:03.954
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

00:36:04.122 --> 00:36:05.234
makes no difference.

00:36:05.435 --> 00:36:10.678
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

00:36:10.879 --> 00:36:17.754
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

00:36:19.655 --> 00:36:23.186
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

00:36:23.387 --> 00:36:28.642
and that's the only source of her life,

00:36:28.843 --> 00:36:32.969
then I can understand why she is so upset.

00:36:39.149 --> 00:36:42.014
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

00:36:42.215 --> 00:36:46.334
very easily, it's not difficult,

00:36:46.826 --> 00:36:51.459
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

00:36:51.982 --> 00:37:01.128
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

00:37:02.108 --> 00:37:06.052
then what happens, you get understanding.

00:37:06.283 --> 00:37:12.690
Understanding of that person, you realize,

00:37:14.102 --> 00:37:17.712
as if identified with that person.

00:37:18.589 --> 00:37:23.415
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

00:37:23.616 --> 00:37:29.156
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

00:37:29.357 --> 00:37:34.042
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

00:37:34.242 --> 00:37:39.442
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

00:37:43.204 --> 00:37:49.188
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

00:37:49.389 --> 00:37:52.788
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

00:37:52.989 --> 00:37:57.755
The identification with another is very
important.

00:38:02.327 --> 00:38:07.888
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

00:38:09.130 --> 00:38:14.697
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

00:38:16.105 --> 00:38:23.054
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

00:38:23.254 --> 00:38:30.249
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

00:38:31.856 --> 00:38:42.957
This ego will immediately sucked in

00:38:43.158 --> 00:38:49.767
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

00:38:54.798 --> 00:38:59.547
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:09.824
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

00:39:10.693 --> 00:39:14.404
Because you are a realized soul.

00:39:17.757 --> 00:39:21.867
Also, as I said,

00:39:23.974 --> 00:39:28.044
when you are identified with another
person,

00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:34.270
you put that person in charge of divinity -

00:39:40.004 --> 00:39:45.819
just a feeling of oneness.

00:39:48.842 --> 00:39:55.757
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

00:39:58.673 --> 00:40:04.985
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

00:40:05.186 --> 00:40:12.405
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

00:40:12.606 --> 00:40:17.030
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

00:40:17.231 --> 00:40:23.036
Not a saint, saint never says that.

00:40:23.949 --> 00:40:25.810
That time, when you say that,

00:40:26.011 --> 00:40:29.574
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

00:40:29.775 --> 00:40:32.129
For example, the one, now supposing

00:40:32.330 --> 00:40:37.547
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

00:40:39.035 --> 00:40:42.788
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

00:40:42.989 --> 00:40:47.965
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

00:40:52.485 --> 00:40:56.822
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

00:40:57.584 --> 00:41:00.626
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

00:41:00.827 --> 00:41:03.787
or the gentleman who has done it,

00:41:04.529 --> 00:41:08.934
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

00:41:09.585 --> 00:41:14.144
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

00:41:14.345 --> 00:41:17.051
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

00:41:17.252 --> 00:41:21.569
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

00:41:25.442 --> 00:41:29.065
Who are you to judge anyone?

00:41:34.490 --> 00:41:43.189
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

00:41:44.328 --> 00:41:51.405
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

00:41:51.606 --> 00:41:55.545
So why waste energy on judging others?

00:41:59.577 --> 00:42:05.438
We should see what is good in others,

00:42:07.363 --> 00:42:11.102
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

00:42:11.303 --> 00:42:13.819
everything first class.

00:42:16.111 --> 00:42:23.941
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

00:42:25.874 --> 00:42:30.672
You can watch, you can witness,

00:42:31.513 --> 00:42:37.007
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

00:42:37.208 --> 00:42:41.061
something that would upset others.

00:42:42.063 --> 00:42:44.977
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

00:42:45.178 --> 00:42:50.398
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

00:42:50.599 --> 00:42:54.234
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

00:42:54.435 --> 00:42:57.081
is just bubbling through that,

00:42:57.282 --> 00:43:02.062
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

00:43:02.263 --> 00:43:07.251
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

00:43:07.592 --> 00:43:10.317
You can be in the same position.

00:43:10.518 --> 00:43:13.064
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

00:43:13.264 --> 00:43:16.299
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

00:43:16.499 --> 00:43:21.103
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

00:43:21.587 --> 00:43:26.905
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

00:43:27.203 --> 00:43:31.285
you are too great to bother about these
things.

00:43:32.288 --> 00:43:38.406
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

00:43:38.607 --> 00:43:42.948
and just making yourselves small.

00:43:45.182 --> 00:43:51.664
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

00:43:51.865 --> 00:43:59.814
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

00:44:00.977 --> 00:44:06.682
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

00:44:08.289 --> 00:44:14.662
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

00:44:15.447 --> 00:44:19.388
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:21.035 --> 00:44:24.564
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:27.421 --> 00:44:31.740
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

00:44:37.006 --> 00:44:44.210
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

00:44:44.411 --> 00:44:47.762
what love I have expressed?

00:44:48.176 --> 00:44:53.119
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

00:44:54.071 --> 00:45:00.675
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

00:45:00.876 --> 00:45:04.733
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

00:45:04.933 --> 00:45:10.321
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

00:45:10.522 --> 00:45:17.049
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

00:45:17.346 --> 00:45:20.461
But what have you done

00:45:24.159 --> 00:45:28.413
in this realm of reality?

00:45:28.961 --> 00:45:32.738
Have you enjoyed the reality?

00:45:34.095 --> 00:45:44.636
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

00:45:47.672 --> 00:45:57.959
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

00:45:59.205 --> 00:46:04.841
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

00:46:05.042 --> 00:46:11.180
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

00:46:11.719 --> 00:46:20.466
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

00:46:22.396 --> 00:46:36.159
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

00:46:37.612 --> 00:46:42.104
So ugly this world has become.

00:46:43.652 --> 00:46:46.831
Can you beautify it?

00:46:49.502 --> 00:46:53.524
You can, because you can transform people.

00:46:53.725 --> 00:47:01.196
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

00:47:03.454 --> 00:47:09.982
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

00:47:11.117 --> 00:47:17.511
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

00:47:18.661 --> 00:47:25.858
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

00:47:26.059 --> 00:47:31.208
The another side is that we are still
identified

00:47:31.408 --> 00:47:35.868
with things which we should not have been
identified.

00:47:38.110 --> 00:47:40.941
We can just find out.

00:47:43.191 --> 00:47:52.804
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

00:47:55.784 --> 00:48:06.014
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:12.229
All the fools, you see,

00:48:12.430 --> 00:48:18.989
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:29.112
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

00:48:30.152 --> 00:48:33.770
God knows when it is going to collide.

00:48:34.302 --> 00:48:40.280
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

00:48:40.481 --> 00:48:44.311
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

00:48:44.512 --> 00:48:48.173
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

00:48:48.374 --> 00:48:52.444
come home and again quarrel and fight.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:59.030
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

00:48:59.411 --> 00:49:02.771
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

00:49:02.972 --> 00:49:06.973
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

00:49:07.174 --> 00:49:11.715
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

00:49:11.916 --> 00:49:15.806
and what happens to them? Nothing.

00:49:16.109 --> 00:49:20.716
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

00:49:20.917 --> 00:49:26.312
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

00:49:27.042 --> 00:49:32.283
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

00:49:35.937 --> 00:49:41.569
I've known so many people like that.

00:49:45.823 --> 00:49:54.332
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

00:49:54.533 --> 00:49:58.576
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

00:49:58.777 --> 00:50:04.173
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

00:50:04.374 --> 00:50:08.158
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

00:50:08.359 --> 00:50:14.581
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

00:50:15.748 --> 00:50:20.201
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

00:50:20.401 --> 00:50:23.613
everybody knew he's having a bath,

00:50:23.814 --> 00:50:30.090
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

00:50:30.291 --> 00:50:35.941
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

00:50:36.528 --> 00:50:39.037
and I heard something like,

00:50:39.238 --> 00:50:42.360
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

00:50:42.561 --> 00:50:45.616
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

00:50:45.817 --> 00:50:50.625
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

00:50:50.826 --> 00:50:54.940
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

00:50:55.141 --> 00:51:00.821
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

00:51:01.021 --> 00:51:08.809
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

00:51:09.009 --> 00:51:11.695
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

00:51:11.896 --> 00:51:17.026
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:22.747
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

00:51:23.223 --> 00:51:26.962
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

00:51:27.163 --> 00:51:34.175
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

00:51:34.376 --> 00:51:43.576
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

00:51:44.274 --> 00:51:47.899
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

00:51:48.100 --> 00:51:54.737
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

00:51:55.785 --> 00:51:59.629
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

00:51:59.830 --> 00:52:05.180
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

00:52:05.381 --> 00:52:11.136
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

00:52:11.337 --> 00:52:18.770
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

00:52:19.484 --> 00:52:23.817
That kills the full experience of reality.

00:52:25.383 --> 00:52:30.643
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

00:52:30.844 --> 00:52:35.558
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

00:52:35.759 --> 00:52:38.557
morning till evening.

00:52:39.521 --> 00:52:41.773
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

00:52:41.974 --> 00:52:44.254
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

00:52:44.455 --> 00:52:47.555
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

00:52:47.756 --> 00:52:50.508
But we are not brainless people.

00:52:50.709 --> 00:52:55.719
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

00:52:56.434 --> 00:53:00.372
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

00:53:00.573 --> 00:53:04.288
or which are something, we don't.

00:53:06.868 --> 00:53:17.383
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

00:53:19.335 --> 00:53:26.440
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

00:53:27.623 --> 00:53:31.743
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

00:53:31.944 --> 00:53:35.021
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

00:53:35.222 --> 00:53:41.809
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

00:53:42.010 --> 00:53:49.420
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

00:53:51.263 --> 00:54:02.074
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

00:54:02.275 --> 00:54:09.896
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

00:54:11.718 --> 00:54:17.197
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

00:54:17.398 --> 00:54:23.214
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

00:54:23.415 --> 00:54:28.246
It's absolutely a flexible personality

00:54:28.447 --> 00:54:39.156
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

00:54:42.231 --> 00:54:49.144
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

00:54:50.699 --> 00:54:57.691
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

00:54:57.892 --> 00:55:06.580
that are facing us because of stupidity.

00:55:08.409 --> 00:55:12.619
This integration I'm sure will take place,

00:55:15.147 --> 00:55:23.494
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

00:55:24.010 --> 00:55:33.747
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

00:55:34.151 --> 00:55:37.141
It's going to happen.

00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:42.543
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

00:55:42.744 --> 00:55:48.625
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

00:55:48.826 --> 00:55:54.536
to truth and reality? It will.

00:55:55.108 --> 00:56:00.112
So today, on such an important day for us,

00:56:00.313 --> 00:56:06.881
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

00:56:07.082 --> 00:56:16.881
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

00:56:17.082 --> 00:56:23.168
light of compassion, light of love

00:56:25.196 --> 00:56:33.947
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

00:56:34.590 --> 00:56:42.461
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

00:56:43.326 --> 00:56:46.862
May God bless you.
