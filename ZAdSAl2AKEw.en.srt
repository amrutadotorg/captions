1
00:00:08,433 --> 00:00:14,640
So, you move to the third center
which we call as the Nabhi chakra.

2
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:24,177
This center is, on one side, is made
of water and another side with fire.

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:34,554
Around it are our ten valencies, which we can
call as our innate religion within ourselves.

4
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:50,580
Now this Nabhi itself – or we can call the solar
plexus or we can say the Navel chakra – gives us,

5
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:54,540
as soon as the Kundalini rises,

6
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,660
she awakens this and the light when
it spreads, you become religious.

7
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,821
I don't have to tell you
anything, you just become.

8
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,280
I don't have to say that you don't take drugs.

9
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,660
You just don't take it.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:13,046
Overnight I have seen people have given up drugs.

11
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:15,780
Overnight, alcoholism, overnight, everything.

12
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:18,060
And they enjoy their virtues.

13
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,200
That's the best part of it.

14
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,420
Some people think, "Well then,
what is the fun?" What is this

15
00:01:25,260 --> 00:01:30,838
that you take something in the pub
and next day you have hangover?

16
00:01:31,740 --> 00:01:36,546
Here you take something and next
day you are much better off.

17
00:01:36,932 --> 00:01:39,000
It never comes down.

18
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:41,280
It never gives you a reaction.

19
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
It's not artificial.

20
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,700
It's not intoxicating.

21
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,779
It is from your nerves it is bubbling out.

22
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:53,520
So, this is the center which is very important in

23
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,404
us because most of us have
a problem with this center.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:15,900
And here we have a capacity, by this
center, that we enjoy our generosity.

25
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:22,920
Now all matter whatever it
is – we are materialistic,

26
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,680
materialistic, it is a good
idea to be materialistic.

27
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,140
But the matter is, the aesthetics of matters are,

28
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,397
that you can give it to others
suggesting your love in it.

29
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:40,433
I think that's the only thing a matter can do.

30
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:46,640
And in a very special way
you can express that love.

31
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:55,920
For example, somebody likes a particular thing –
you go all the way to get it and give that small

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:06,960
thing, very small thing, to the person and the
joy, not out of the money that you have spent,

33
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:15,084
but the feelings you have expressed of
knowing what that person would love.

34
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,560
And this kind of a depth develops within you.

35
00:03:25,361 --> 00:03:32,879
Such lovable, beautiful society you enter into.

36
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,796
And you don't need anything because
everybody is looking after your needs.

37
00:03:39,718 --> 00:03:43,755
Now I have told them I love flowers
because I don't take anything else.

38
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:48,900
So, you must see whenever I come My house is so
filled with flowers that My husband was saying,

39
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:52,360
"Let us go and live in the garden
and let the flowers be here."

40
00:03:54,960 --> 00:04:00,180
So, you see, the joy of
giving comes from this center.

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:12,360
And whatever you eat, whatever you have
to eat, whatever is good for you, you eat.

42
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,620
You don't have to bother as to
what to eat, what not to eat.

43
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:20,640
You just eat whatever is good
for you, benevolent for you.

44
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:26,400
You become so wise. And also you please others.

45
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,780
You don't displease others by saying
"this is bad food, I want that."

46
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,820
"I want" goes away.

47
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,445
What do you want?

48
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:46,560
So the - like you could say a candle which is
not enlightened, is waiting to be enlightened,

49
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,780
is asking for the light, "I want light".

50
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:59,460
But once it is enlightened, it gives light
to others, automatically; supposed to be.

51
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:08,340
In the same way you also start giving your light,
your love, your joy to others, automatically.

52
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:10,560
I don't have to tell you.

53
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Nobody has to go through any
Ten Commandments anymore.

54
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,082
Those days are gone.

55
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,740
Now automatically you become like that.

56
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:34,380
Very beautiful people, very
affectionate and glorious, I should say.

57
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,740
If you see the glow on the face of
Sahaja Yogis, the face itself is radiant.

58
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,908
Many people drop out their ten
years to twenty years in their age.

59
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,115
And they are so enthusiastic, never get tired.
