WEBVTT

00:07.160 --> 00:09.920
A very simple understanding should be that

00:10.080 --> 00:13.320
why are we in Sahaja Yoga?

00:13.520 --> 00:16.720
We are in Sahaja Yoga to ascend,

00:16.880 --> 00:20.760
to go higher and higher, as you sang yesterday.

00:20.920 --> 00:23.520
It was very entertaining yesterday the way

00:23.680 --> 00:29.640
you talked about your ambition to be higher and higher,

00:29.800 --> 00:34.800
really it was very joy giving, no doubt.

00:34.960 --> 00:38.280
But what are we doing about it?

00:38.440 --> 00:41.120
What are we trying about it, we should see.

00:41.280 --> 00:45.400
Seriously we must think, are we meditating?

00:45.560 --> 00:50.840
Are we all doing something to elevate others also,

00:51.000 --> 00:53.120
to give Realisation to others?

00:53.280 --> 00:56.520
Specially women, I've seen, don't do much of this,

00:56.680 --> 00:59.920
which is very bad, because you are the mothers.

01:00.080 --> 01:04.400
You have to go all out to give Realisation to others,

01:04.560 --> 01:07.800
but men are more active that way and women are not.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.200
So, it works the other way round.

01:10.360 --> 01:14.800
Now, on one side, the men are, I think, are active,

01:14.960 --> 01:16.360
but don't meditate,

01:16.520 --> 01:19.800
women meditate and men do the outside works,

01:19.960 --> 01:27.480
sort of a part time or you can call it a good labour division

01:27.640 --> 01:31.400
that you meditate at home and we'll go all out.

01:31.560 --> 01:33.320
It's not going to work out.

01:33.520 --> 01:36.240
So, one has to meditate

01:36.400 --> 01:42.880
and one has to also go out to spread Sahaja Yoga.

01:43.040 --> 01:46.080
Both things have to be done.

01:46.240 --> 01:50.320
Supposing now, you meditate and you don't spread Sahaja Yoga,

01:50.480 --> 01:52.680
you will never ascend,

01:52.840 --> 01:56.480
because after all this Kundalini, you see,

01:56.640 --> 02:00.680
She is a sensible woman, She is very sensible.

02:00.840 --> 02:07.840
She thinks: "Why should I make her a saint, what is the use?"

02:07.960 --> 02:11.240
Sahaja Yoga is not individualistic.

02:11.400 --> 02:13.800
It's not for one person to become a saint

02:13.960 --> 02:17.480
and sit somewhere. It's not like that.

02:18.200 --> 02:22.320
It's not meant for one person, for oneself,

02:22.480 --> 02:24.360
it's not individualistic.

02:24.520 --> 02:26.720
It's a collective happening.

02:26.880 --> 02:30.040
So, if you are not helping to the collective,

02:30.200 --> 02:33.040
Kundalini says: "Alright, you are alright as it is!"

02:33.200 --> 02:34.800
Just like our body:

02:34.960 --> 02:37.600
see in our body, if one organ says:

02:37.760 --> 02:40.720
"Alright, now I'm alright, I'm not going to work out."

02:40.920 --> 02:44.040
Or one cell says that: "I'm not going to now grow,

02:44.200 --> 02:48.360
it's alright, why should I worry about the whole body?" It won't.

02:48.360 --> 02:51.160
It's a living, it's a living organism!

02:51.320 --> 02:52.920
I have told you 100 times,

02:53.080 --> 02:56.440
when it is a living organism, it has to grow,

02:56.600 --> 03:01.400
it has to grow and also to absorb.

03:01.560 --> 03:05.280
To have energy, you have to meditate and you have to grow.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.360
If you don't grow, you are finished,

03:08.520 --> 03:09.880
you are no more a Sahaja Yogi.

03:10.040 --> 03:12.240
I wouldn't call a person a Sahaja Yogi

03:12.400 --> 03:17.320
who has not even given one person Realisation.

03:17.480 --> 03:18.720
Cannot be a Sahaja Yogi!

03:18.880 --> 03:22.800
Sahaja Yogi has to give Realisation to others.

03:22.960 --> 03:25.960
Apart from other activities, the main activity

03:26.160 --> 03:30.040
should be how we give Realisations to others.

03:30.200 --> 03:35.640
Unless and until we really look after that side of life,

03:35.800 --> 03:40.120
we can never, never grow in Sahaja Yoga.

03:40.800 --> 03:44.560
For example, now take My position,

03:44.720 --> 03:48.640
I'm alright, I'm complete, I have no problem.

03:48.800 --> 03:53.160
But why did I work so hard

03:53.320 --> 03:57.240
and wanted so many Sahaja Yogis? Why?

03:57.400 --> 04:01.520
I don't have to grow either, I'm overgrown already.

04:01.680 --> 04:03.640
I don't have to do it, but why?

04:03.800 --> 04:06.880
What is the need? The need is like this,

04:07.040 --> 04:09.280
the need is of love.

04:09.440 --> 04:13.640
I have so much love that I have to canalize it.

04:13.800 --> 04:18.720
If I don't, I'll suffocate. I can't love Myself.

04:18.880 --> 04:21.240
So this love has to spread.

04:21.400 --> 04:24.720
For that, I have to have you people who can

04:24.880 --> 04:28.040
take this love to others and make them happy.

04:28.200 --> 04:33.360
This is a kind of a vision I have,

04:33.520 --> 04:36.720
and in this special time,

04:36.880 --> 04:40.960
it was promised by many people, by many saints

04:41.120 --> 04:46.000
and it is so obvious that your are all specially chosen

04:46.160 --> 04:47.960
for this kind of thing.

04:48.120 --> 04:53.800
Now, how far you understand your importance is a different point.

04:58.240 --> 05:04.720
You do for your emancipation, alright you meditate,

05:05.320 --> 05:09.320
but if you are not canalizing the love,

05:09.480 --> 05:12.360
the Divine love, what is the use?

05:12.520 --> 05:16.280
Now, supposing I repair something very nicely,

05:16.440 --> 05:18.560
I repair this machine nicely,

05:18.720 --> 05:21.400
put it right, everything and I don't speak,

05:21.560 --> 05:24.760
what is the use of having this?

05:25.280 --> 05:27.520
In the same way, if you work very hard...

05:27.680 --> 05:31.720
I know people who get up at four o'clock, have their bath,

05:31.880 --> 05:34.040
do meditation, sit down.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.960
In the night again, they sit down for meditation,

05:38.160 --> 05:40.600
but they never go out,

05:40.760 --> 05:42.360
they never talk to others,

05:42.520 --> 05:44.320
they never spread Sahaja Yoga,

05:44.480 --> 05:46.880
they do not give Divine love to others,

05:47.040 --> 05:51.960
so how can this great problem of this world

05:52.120 --> 05:55.080
be solved that it has no love,

05:55.240 --> 05:58.200
it has never known Divine love.

05:58.360 --> 06:04.280
It has to be given to them,

06:04.440 --> 06:08.440
they have to feel this Divine love,

06:08.600 --> 06:13.760
this power of Adi Shakti.

06:13.920 --> 06:16.080
They have to know it,

06:16.240 --> 06:19.080
otherwise you have been selfish, I would say,

06:19.240 --> 06:21.800
that you had a nice time, having all this

06:21.960 --> 06:25.720
and you have not given to others.

06:25.880 --> 06:30.360
This is the reason why Sahaja Yoga sometimes fails

06:30.520 --> 06:35.960
to create a proper balanced personality in a human being.

06:36.160 --> 06:40.240
Some people are like this, that now supposing,

06:40.400 --> 06:42.880
a Sahaja Yogi has married another Sahaja Yogini,

06:43.040 --> 06:45.080
take a position like that.

06:45.240 --> 06:48.480
Now, My desire is that they should develop

06:48.640 --> 06:51.960
a complete understanding of each other, love for each other,

06:52.160 --> 06:58.160
but love for Sahaja Yoga and for others.

06:58.320 --> 07:06.200
This is the only way we can justify marriage in Sahaja Yoga.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.520
Otherwise why should they marry?

07:09.680 --> 07:12.280
But it doesn't happen like that.

07:12.440 --> 07:14.600
What happens is that first they are married,

07:14.760 --> 07:18.440
then either they will quarrel,

07:19.040 --> 07:21.160
they will ask for divorce.

07:21.320 --> 07:23.720
If that doesn't happen luckily,

07:23.880 --> 07:27.360
-because in Sahaja Yoga it's so easy to get married, you know-

07:27.520 --> 07:29.320
if that doesn't happen,

07:29.480 --> 07:33.600
then they start having their own family,

07:33.760 --> 07:36.960
their own homes, becoming very small,

07:37.120 --> 07:42.160
very, very small, very limited.

07:42.320 --> 07:46.200
Did you come to Sahaja Yoga for that?

07:47.640 --> 07:50.240
You have to realize your responsibility.

07:50.400 --> 07:55.240
See this Mother Earth, how She knows Her responsibility.

07:55.400 --> 08:00.280
She is just made out of nothing but soil and mud,

08:00.440 --> 08:02.040
but look at Her

08:02.200 --> 08:05.400
how She is conscious, how She is particular,

08:05.560 --> 08:08.480
how She works it out, how She is attentive,

08:08.640 --> 08:10.200
how She is careful.

08:10.360 --> 08:14.400
While you, though you have been blessed so much

08:14.560 --> 08:17.880
by everything, you are, are you thinking

08:18.040 --> 08:20.840
of giving it to others?

08:20.960 --> 08:27.480
With twelve disciples, whatever was the problem of Christianity,

08:27.640 --> 08:31.080
it's not a good job, I must say, but still

08:31.240 --> 08:35.240
Christianity spread out.

08:36.120 --> 08:40.320
Islam was not a very good job either, it spread out.

08:40.480 --> 08:43.520
All those bad jobs have spread out so much.

08:43.680 --> 08:47.440
So why not the good job of Sahaja Yoga?

08:47.600 --> 08:51.880
It has to spread, it has to go to various places.

08:52.040 --> 08:56.200
Try and find out where you can go and talk about it

08:56.360 --> 08:58.440
and do something good to others

08:58.600 --> 09:01.320
and help them somehow

09:01.480 --> 09:06.880
to rise above this common existence

09:07.040 --> 09:11.840
of misery, unhappiness and destruction.

09:11.960 --> 09:13.920
The time is very short

09:14.080 --> 09:17.200
and, I think, if you see the time,

09:17.360 --> 09:21.960
the rate at which we are moving is not proper.

09:22.160 --> 09:23.840
We have to be much faster,

09:24.000 --> 09:25.640
we have to go much ahead

09:25.800 --> 09:31.240
and we have to create much more Sahaja Yogis

09:31.400 --> 09:39.720
through our consistent, very intensive effort.

09:39.880 --> 09:44.080
But it's a side issue, by the way,

09:44.240 --> 09:45.960
Sahaja Yoga is by the way.

09:46.120 --> 09:50.040
And this is where we are failing in our responsibility.

09:50.200 --> 09:52.800
We have to learn from the Mother Earth.

09:52.960 --> 09:56.320
You might say that: "Mataji, how can we be like You?

09:56.480 --> 09:59.560
After all, You are Adi Shakti!" Many people say like this.

09:59.720 --> 10:00.720
"You are Adi Shakti." "So what?"

10:01.640 --> 10:04.720
"You see, with one finger you can move things like that!"

10:04.880 --> 10:10.480
But why should I? Why should I? What is the need?

10:11.320 --> 10:16.560
So in that reflection that you are Me,

10:16.720 --> 10:21.520
in that reflection that the Mother Earth is Me,

10:21.680 --> 10:26.480
in that beautiful creation within you,

10:26.640 --> 10:30.880
you have to become very sensitive

10:31.040 --> 10:36.680
to the need of the world. What is the need of the world?

10:36.840 --> 10:41.840
Today, if you fail, the whole thing will fail forever.

10:41.960 --> 10:44.880
Only very few will be there.

10:45.040 --> 10:50.360
So the need for you is to spread Sahaja Yoga,

10:50.520 --> 10:55.040
because this love is not only for you,

10:55.200 --> 10:57.800
is not to be enjoyed by you,

10:57.960 --> 11:00.960
but is to be enjoyed

11:01.120 --> 11:05.600
by as many possible in whole world.

11:05.960 --> 11:09.160
So, today we have to decide that

11:09.320 --> 11:12.000
as the children of Adi Shakti,

11:12.160 --> 11:14.800
we have to go all out,

11:14.960 --> 11:17.600
everywhere, every corner,

11:17.760 --> 11:23.120
we have to shout, and we have to tell loudly

11:23.280 --> 11:27.280
what is the time in which we are living

11:27.440 --> 11:31.760
and what is the responsibility

11:31.920 --> 11:39.400
that you have to fulfil as Sahaja Yogis.

11:39.560 --> 11:43.600
There must be some reason why you are here.

11:43.760 --> 11:46.560
Like in the beginning, Sahaja Yogis used to ask Me:

11:46.720 --> 11:49.640
"Mother, was I this last life?

11:49.800 --> 11:51.920
Was I Shivaji last life?"

11:52.080 --> 11:55.840
I said: "What's the use?" You might have been anything,

11:56.000 --> 12:00.320
but what you are today is much higher, try to understand!

12:01.120 --> 12:03.120
You might be, say, Napoleon,

12:03.280 --> 12:08.360
you might be, say, one of the kings

12:08.520 --> 12:11.120
or maybe, or may be the queen from somewhere, so what?

12:11.280 --> 12:16.080
What did they do? Did they raise anybody's Kundalini?

12:16.240 --> 12:18.440
Did they have any power?

12:18.600 --> 12:22.080
Even the disciples of Christ or even

12:22.240 --> 12:24.880
Mohammed Sahib's disciples, anyone,

12:25.040 --> 12:26.480
did they do it?

12:26.640 --> 12:31.520
Did they have any understanding of Kundalini?

12:31.680 --> 12:36.720
Did they have any love for others

12:36.880 --> 12:39.640
that they should give them Realisation?

12:39.800 --> 12:43.600
There were some Sufis, they never gave Realisation to anyone,

12:43.760 --> 12:47.240
there were so many saints who never gave Realisation to anybody.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.240
Mohammed Sahib never gave Realisation to anybody,

12:50.400 --> 12:53.480
Gautam Buddha never gave Realisation to anybody,

12:53.640 --> 12:54.560
think of it!

12:54.720 --> 12:58.560
Christ never gave Realisation to anybody, anybody!

12:58.720 --> 13:00.560
Krishna did not do it, Rama did not do it,

13:00.720 --> 13:05.240
nobody, but you can do it!!

13:06.680 --> 13:07.960
You can do it

13:08.160 --> 13:12.120
and you know everything about Kundalini.

13:12.280 --> 13:13.960
It's a very big thing

13:14.160 --> 13:18.720
because you are children of the Adi Shakti.

13:18.880 --> 13:23.120
You are here and your Mother is here.

13:23.280 --> 13:30.320
It's a very, very fortunate thing for Me that you are here.

13:30.520 --> 13:32.280
I'm very proud of you,

13:32.440 --> 13:35.320
but again and again I have to tell you

13:35.480 --> 13:39.720
that the work has to be with a faster speed,

13:39.880 --> 13:42.680
we have to move with a faster speed

13:42.840 --> 13:46.040
and get more people to Sahaja Yoga.

13:46.200 --> 13:50.600
It is rather, rather difficult for Me

13:50.760 --> 13:52.960
to say something forcefully.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.200
That's not My nature, you know.

13:55.360 --> 13:58.680
Can't get into tempers and cannot get angry

13:58.840 --> 14:02.920
and I cannot forcefully say something to you,

14:03.080 --> 14:07.080
But if you fail, then

14:07.240 --> 14:11.720
only thing will be that you have failed Me completely.

14:11.880 --> 14:14.960
It means that, nothing less than that.

14:15.160 --> 14:17.200
And if you don't want to do it,

14:17.360 --> 14:20.920
then I would request all of you to take a vow today,

14:21.080 --> 14:24.760
that you spread Sahaja Yoga and you will talk about Sahaja Yoga,

14:24.920 --> 14:26.440
know about Sahaja Yoga.

14:26.600 --> 14:29.200
There are many who don't know anything.

14:29.360 --> 14:33.080
Also it is very surprising, they are Sahaja Yogis, they don't know anything.

14:33.240 --> 14:37.000
And don't create problems for Me like marriage:

14:37.160 --> 14:40.320
"We can't now live with the wife, we can't live with the husband."

14:40.480 --> 14:42.720
All sort of nonsensical problems

14:42.880 --> 14:46.040
people create for Me in Sahaja Yoga.

14:46.200 --> 14:50.960
Are you here to create problems or to remove problems of people?

14:51.120 --> 14:54.240
So, on the whole, we have done well, I must say,

14:54.400 --> 14:59.360
but it's not the final, we have to work faster

14:59.520 --> 15:02.920
with more enthusiasm and joyfully.

15:03.080 --> 15:04.720
You don't know what joy you get

15:04.880 --> 15:07.160
when you give Realisation to somebody.

15:07.320 --> 15:13.240
The most joyful moment is when you give Realisation to others.

15:13.400 --> 15:17.240
Just try, you must try once, you'll enjoy it,

15:17.400 --> 15:19.520
and then you want more and more and more.

15:19.680 --> 15:21.720
Now, after Sahaja Yoga, really,

15:21.880 --> 15:25.640
the want disappears into this desire that:

15:25.800 --> 15:27.840
"My God, this man is going,

15:27.960 --> 15:29.960
should I call him and give him Realisation?"

15:30.120 --> 15:31.840
On the street, you'll feel like calling:

15:32.000 --> 15:34.040
"Come here, come here, I want to give you something!"

15:34.200 --> 15:37.640
You make him sit down and you give Realisation.

15:37.800 --> 15:40.680
This will be your style, like mad, you'll say:

15:40.840 --> 15:42.960
"Ah no! Look at this,

15:43.120 --> 15:47.320
this gentleman is without any Realisation, let us give."

15:47.480 --> 15:50.200
You'll have to go to churches, to universities,

15:50.360 --> 15:52.680
you'll have to go to all such congregations

15:52.840 --> 15:56.040
where they have no idea about what they can achieve

15:56.200 --> 16:00.280
and then tell them without any fear, without any malice.

16:00.440 --> 16:02.720
You can talk to them and you should tell them:

16:02.880 --> 16:05.560
"Now, we are here to help, for your good,

16:05.720 --> 16:08.200
we have not come for our good but for your good,

16:08.360 --> 16:12.760
now listen to us!" And I'm sure, very sure

16:12.920 --> 16:15.680
that the Kundalini within you will be very happy.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.160
She's not happy, you see,

16:17.320 --> 16:21.160
She's not happy with people who are not using Her fully.

16:21.320 --> 16:23.920
So, She'll be very happy to help you

16:24.080 --> 16:29.320
and do the needful for the emancipation of the whole world.

16:29.520 --> 16:33.560
May God bless you!
