00:13.740 --> 00:23.880
on the easter day we give people eggs to

00:21.960 --> 00:31.980
remind them that you are egg now when

00:23.880 --> 00:36.810
you have to become the bird but I don't

00:31.980 --> 00:40.880
think people know that because

00:36.810 --> 00:40.880
resurrection is the message of Christ

00:42.260 --> 00:47.489
Lucy fiction is the compliment

00:44.610 --> 00:57.359
accomplishment but resurrection is his

00:47.489 --> 01:04.280
message and it is a very significant

00:57.359 --> 01:12.270
thing and it is written in one of the

01:04.280 --> 01:16.409
ancient scriptures in India why Easter

01:12.270 --> 01:20.430
should be celebrated with an egg is most

01:16.409 --> 01:23.790
surprising was clear it's very clear

01:20.430 --> 01:32.659
that if one can see how Christ is

01:23.790 --> 01:36.240
symbolized as an egg now what is an egg

01:32.659 --> 01:41.610
in fact it's the language a branding is

01:36.240 --> 01:46.590
called as three Jaya he Jaya theme means

01:41.610 --> 01:50.280
the one who is born twice and a bird is

01:46.590 --> 01:55.950
also called any bird is called as a

01:50.280 --> 02:00.149
divita means twice for because first the

01:55.950 --> 02:05.310
bird is born as an egg and then reborn

02:00.149 --> 02:12.620
as a bird in the same way a human being

02:05.310 --> 02:15.620
is born as an egg and then is born as a

02:12.620 --> 02:15.620
realized

02:17.290 --> 02:23.260
now see how significant it is that both

02:20.019 --> 02:25.840
are called by the same name no other

02:23.260 --> 02:28.930
animal is called as visa unless and

02:25.840 --> 02:36.370
until it has an egg form first and then

02:28.930 --> 02:40.049
it comes out as a another thing for

02:36.370 --> 02:40.049
example no mammals

02:40.920 --> 02:48.459
none of the mammals are called as DJ

02:44.319 --> 02:51.120
except for human beings it is remarkable

02:48.459 --> 02:54.459
in the zoology if you read that a

02:51.120 --> 02:57.189
mammals do not lay their eggs they give

02:54.459 --> 03:00.549
birth directly to their children and we

02:57.189 --> 03:04.930
are also mammals but despite that human

03:00.549 --> 03:07.260
beings are called as V jaha just like

03:04.930 --> 03:07.260
birds

03:08.250 --> 03:20.260
so that means human beings when they are

03:11.859 --> 03:27.459
born are eggs or they become eggs how do

03:20.260 --> 03:30.370
they become eggs is the way our ego and

03:27.459 --> 03:31.930
superego develop within us now you all

03:30.370 --> 03:35.079
being only sahaja Yogi's I think you

03:31.930 --> 03:42.310
understand what I am saying when the ego

03:35.079 --> 03:47.889
and super-ego when the ego and super-ego

03:42.310 --> 03:54.159
there's no chart is it develop in a

03:47.889 --> 03:56.199
human being to the full extent and the

03:54.159 --> 04:01.349
fontanel bone area is completely

03:56.199 --> 04:05.790
calcified then you become an egg you get

04:01.349 --> 04:11.829
completely separated from your mother

04:05.790 --> 04:17.079
from all pervading power of God and you

04:11.829 --> 04:19.150
are left to yourself as an egg till you

04:17.079 --> 04:23.740
make sure within yourself inside the

04:19.150 --> 04:29.430
shell of the egg in your freedom to a

04:23.740 --> 04:29.430
point where you are ready for hatching

04:29.860 --> 04:36.340
the mother bird has to pierce in the

04:32.230 --> 04:38.490
head of them egg and you come out as

04:36.340 --> 04:42.370
first you are already there inside

04:38.490 --> 04:47.350
developed and then you fly out into the

04:42.370 --> 04:49.740
space of all-pervading power of divine

04:47.350 --> 04:49.740
love

04:50.940 --> 05:03.910
so how significant is Easter and why

04:55.570 --> 05:09.700
Christ he came on this earth because he

05:03.910 --> 05:14.470
had learnt the idea he had practiced the

05:09.700 --> 05:26.650
idea or we can say that he was an expert

05:14.470 --> 05:32.350
on this that he could himself surpassed

05:26.650 --> 05:38.740
that hurdle by which he becomes worthy

05:32.350 --> 05:42.490
job but he was that already but how are

05:38.740 --> 05:47.770
you to believe that you can be Regis you

05:42.490 --> 05:51.610
can be reborn it was said by every

05:47.770 --> 05:55.570
religion by every prophet that you are

05:51.610 --> 05:56.880
to be born again unless and until you

05:55.570 --> 05:59.740
are reborn

05:56.880 --> 06:03.400
that means baptism not this kind of

05:59.740 --> 06:06.550
baptism but the real one unless and

06:03.400 --> 06:10.470
until this shell is broken on your

06:06.550 --> 06:14.050
fontanel area you cannot become the

06:10.470 --> 06:19.350
region it is written in all the

06:14.050 --> 06:22.120
scriptures said by all the prophets

06:19.350 --> 06:26.860
somebody had to show you that this can

06:22.120 --> 06:29.980
be done he he being the divine power

06:26.860 --> 06:34.990
itself the Pranava she being the brahma

06:29.980 --> 06:39.370
itself his rebirth was resurrection

06:34.990 --> 06:43.110
bodily resurrection while yours is the

06:39.370 --> 06:51.720
resurrection which is

06:43.110 --> 06:57.740
in your consciousness and you see it

06:51.720 --> 07:00.389
clearly this is what is Easter is I

06:57.740 --> 07:04.249
wonder how many Christians know the

07:00.389 --> 07:08.989
significance of an A

07:04.249 --> 07:14.629
it signifies a stage where you are

07:08.989 --> 07:17.959
before realization when you are in your

07:14.629 --> 07:22.459
action that you are mr. a exactly this

07:17.959 --> 07:27.259
is why all that but when you mature will

07:22.459 --> 07:30.799
be inside the bird is ready and that is

07:27.259 --> 07:35.689
the time you are hatched this is the

07:30.799 --> 07:38.419
time you get twice born so actually the

07:35.689 --> 07:44.209
resurrection of Christ signifies that

07:38.419 --> 07:46.610
and that's why we give that it people

07:44.209 --> 07:52.269
say you are anything reminder of that

07:46.610 --> 07:55.189
and this egg can become respect and also

07:52.269 --> 07:58.699
it is written that he was an egg when he

07:55.189 --> 08:04.989
came first one taken as an egg half of

07:58.699 --> 08:08.959
it remain as Ganesha and half of it

08:04.989 --> 08:13.929
became harsh - then he came on this

08:08.959 --> 08:19.240
earth I departed with all these elements

08:13.929 --> 08:25.630
pure vibration found his body

08:19.240 --> 08:31.660
he remained there using all of you to be

08:25.630 --> 08:35.349
awakened and when the kundalini takes

08:31.660 --> 08:40.330
your attention through that point there

08:35.349 --> 08:43.630
you also become the spirit that's why I

08:40.330 --> 08:45.700
said that I am the gate

08:43.630 --> 08:49.020
I am the dope fiends I am the

08:45.700 --> 08:53.860
destination he said I am the door

08:49.020 --> 08:55.510
because you cannot become Christ that's

08:53.860 --> 08:59.620
why he is saying I am the destination

08:55.510 --> 09:05.070
that you have achieved but he has

08:59.620 --> 09:09.730
created this space for you can become

09:05.070 --> 09:14.800
spiritually awakened you can become

09:09.730 --> 09:18.160
useful but Christ is an incarnation he

09:14.800 --> 09:21.790
was the son of God and so he's an

09:18.160 --> 09:26.170
incarnation and that incarnation came on

09:21.790 --> 09:30.329
this earth just to pull you out of your

09:26.170 --> 09:30.329
elements make you become
