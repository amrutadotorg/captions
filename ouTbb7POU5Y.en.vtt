00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.700
Happy Easter to all of you!

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.030
It's a great day to come to Rome

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.280
to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:51.400
Now we have to do the resurrection of Christianity,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:56.950
which is just moving in the opposite direction

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:00.860
of Christ's resurrection.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.700
As you know that Christ was

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.700
just chaitanya,

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.160
but He came in the body

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.610
of chaitanya.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:33.240
The whole body was made of chaitanya,

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:41.160
and He resurrected Himself

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:46.450
to show to the world

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:52.200
that you can resurrect yourself also,

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:58.660
if you can fill your body with chaitanya.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:08.400
There is always a struggle between the matter and the spirit.

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:13.490
In human life what we see

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.240
that matter is all the time trying to take over the spirit.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:25.320
And that is how we fail in our resurrection.

00:07:25.910 --> 00:07:30.360
We fail in our resurrection

00:07:31.110 --> 00:07:34.450
because we give way to matter.

00:07:35.070 --> 00:07:40.990
We have come from matter - easy to go back to matter.

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:46.820
But all the christian nations

00:07:47.070 --> 00:07:54.780
have taken to the material development -

00:07:55.400 --> 00:08:01.400
identification with the matter, not the sublimation of the matter.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:08.200
Why we have gone wrong is

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:13.660
because matter has become so important to us.

00:08:14.400 --> 00:08:20.400
We are so much identified with the matter, with our body,

00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:24.780
with all that is material for us.

00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:30.530
People are so much worried about the material things.

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:37.530
What I find that the whole culture has become materialistic

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:43.660
and they're absolutely ashamed about it,

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:48.450
but still they continue,

00:08:48.660 --> 00:08:55.030
the way it is so shameful and so degrading.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.950
It degrades human beings.

00:08:59.910 --> 00:09:05.740
As I have come in the West I see this trend very clearly.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:11.160
For example, in a household

00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:15.780
whatever they purchase is for sale, all the time.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.820
So whatever they will purchase, they will see to it

00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.490
that it should be of a certain standard.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.570
Like it should be,

00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:29.280
if it has to be a diamond, it has to be a perfect diamond,

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:32.530
because it has to be sold again.

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:36.360
If they purchase the house, they are afraid that

00:09:36.910 --> 00:09:40.160
we should not spoil it or we should not make it beautiful,

00:09:40.410 --> 00:09:44.400
we should not try to do something

00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:48.360
that will lower the price of the house

00:09:48.610 --> 00:09:54.490
because we like the particular type of decoration.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.860
Everything is for sale.

00:09:58.070 --> 00:09:59.950
They never enjoy any matter, you see.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.820
The enjoyment is not there.

00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.160
Whatever they buy, they think that "can we sell it back?"

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:13.410
Say, even about - I've seen even precious stones.

00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:18.110
Like in India, everybody can afford to have precious stones,

00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.820
because the rich will buy the most expensive ones,

00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:25.110
then the poor people can buy ordinary ones,

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.400
like silver everybody can have,

00:10:27.610 --> 00:10:31.410
because some can have silver which is hundred percent,

00:10:31.610 --> 00:10:34.200
some can have little mixed up,

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:39.240
some can have with some other material.

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:42.610
But if you go to any country in the West,

00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:46.780
it has to have the "hallmark", you see.

00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:50.740
The hallmark has to be there. Otherwise they'll never purchase it

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.280
unless and until there is a hallmark,

00:10:52.450 --> 00:10:58.400
there is a hallmark means, it can be resold.

00:10:59.780 --> 00:11:03.200
Now, supposing in India you buy some...

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.070
everything without hallmarks ... there's no hallmark,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:09.200
but, when you want to sell it also anytime,

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.950
I mean, if you have to sell it,

00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.490
then you go in the market and they know

00:11:15.700 --> 00:11:20.910
what is the intrinsic value of that particular silver

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.910
and that's how they pay you.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:25.450
But we don't have hallmarks.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.700
Now in gold, same thing they do is to have 9 carat gold -

00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:34.490
with a hallmark.

00:11:34.780 --> 00:11:37.400
What is 9 carat gold? Is not gold at all,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.200
but they'll have a hallmark for that.

00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:43.410
And that will be very expensive because you see

00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:45.490
they don't have much gold so they put a hallmark

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.070
and make it expensive.

00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:54.400
The whole economy is that stupidly built towards materialism.

00:11:55.030 --> 00:12:00.030
That matter is not for enjoyment but for selling off.

00:12:00.450 --> 00:12:04.490
So they do not enjoy anything whatsoever in their lives.

00:12:04.820 --> 00:12:09.530
Nowadays I don't know if plastic can be resold or not,

00:12:09.990 --> 00:12:13.320
but I have seen people who are even particular about the plastic,

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:18.910
about stainless steel, about anything that they have.

00:12:19.410 --> 00:12:22.490
May not be resold but now the, psychologically

00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:25.400
they are built in such a manner

00:12:25.570 --> 00:12:28.200
that they want to even preserve,

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.200
if there's a plastic thing, even there's a thread,

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:36.200
anything, a pin, they would like to preserve it, you see?

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.360
Nothing like throwing out anything.

00:12:40.530 --> 00:12:46.400
All these things will lead us

00:12:46.610 --> 00:12:52.570
into unhappiness, frustration and stupidity.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:57.660
So now they form an anti-culture.

00:12:57.910 --> 00:12:59.820
What is an anti-culture? Is nothing

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:05.240
but is another form of materialism, which is ugliness.

00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.490
Like you paint your hair, you become something anti-culture.

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:15.450
If you wear holey pants, then you are anti-culture.

00:13:15.700 --> 00:13:20.400
If you wear dirty clothes, then you are anti-culture.

00:13:20.610 --> 00:13:24.320
But also these are sellable.

00:13:24.490 --> 00:13:27.400
There are markets and markets where you can get

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:32.200
all dirty clothes, "stone washed" clothes.

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.570
All these fashions are coming

00:13:36.030 --> 00:13:39.990
from the two sides or two faces

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:45.700
of materialistic attitude of human beings.

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:49.860
And they're unashamed sometimes the way they ask for a few things.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.700
Supposing you know somebody has forgotten a spoon with someone;

00:13:55.070 --> 00:13:58.820
so they'll telephone three times, "have you got my spoon with you?

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.530
Have you got my spoon?"

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:04.400
Unashamed, there's no culture about it.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:08.030
While - I don't know - might have been better before -

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:10.400
that what I know about India,

00:14:10.700 --> 00:14:14.860
that even now, in a good family, it is always said

00:14:15.110 --> 00:14:19.400
that "if somebody's pen is with you, be careful and return it back,

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:24.360
but even if your gold is with someone, don't ask,

00:14:24.530 --> 00:14:28.780
it's not done, it's not cultured, it's not sophistication."

00:14:29.110 --> 00:14:33.030
But the whole sophistication has become materialistic,

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:37.700
it's maddening, and that maddens the Western mind.

00:14:38.030 --> 00:14:43.110
For example, if you have to serve, say wines and things,

00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:46.200
you have to have different type of cups,

00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:50.200
different types of plates, different type of spoons.

00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:52.490
You've got spoons for avocado,

00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:54.570
you've got spoons for different things -

00:14:54.820 --> 00:14:59.030
I mean, you go on like mad, and if that is not with you,

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:00.360
then they'll laugh at you.

00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:02.110
If they'll come to your house, - "O God!

00:15:02.320 --> 00:15:07.530
They served us avocado with ice-cream spoons!"

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:12.360
That's the greatest sin one can commit.

00:15:12.530 --> 00:15:18.400
So the whole idea of sin becomes so materialistic and nonsensical.

00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:21.280
So the resurrection cannot take place

00:15:21.450 --> 00:15:25.160
when the matter is so dead and gone.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.660
Then this matter enters into the brain.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:33.400
When it enters into the brain it rots there.

00:15:33.660 --> 00:15:39.530
Then you start discussing about, say, banking

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:44.780
or about how to economize this.

00:15:45.110 --> 00:15:47.610
I mean the mantra is in London, as I say,

00:15:47.820 --> 00:15:51.660
must be everywhere "save pounds".

00:15:52.070 --> 00:15:56.530
As soon as you go to the airport, there is big mantra written

00:15:56.740 --> 00:16:02.110
"Save pounds by hiring a taxi at Heathrow".

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:07.910
Just imagine - they are not even aware of what they are doing.

00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:13.990
All the time save pounds, save money, save this, save ... for what?

00:16:14.990 --> 00:16:17.860
Because they are so frustrated,

00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:22.200
the whole material stuff is so frustrating

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:28.280
that they have to save money to get over that frustration.

00:16:31.610 --> 00:16:37.530
And the frustration is counterbalanced

00:16:38.410 --> 00:16:44.400
by drugs or by

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:48.950
drinking wines and all kinds of nonsensical things,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.570
and also rotten cheese

00:16:51.910 --> 00:16:56.450
or some sort of a thing that is absolutely a dead matter,

00:16:56.700 --> 00:17:00.450
useless thing which makes you dead and sleepy,

00:17:00.700 --> 00:17:02.700
so that you run away from reality,

00:17:02.910 --> 00:17:06.740
because you are so frustrated that you want to have something

00:17:06.990 --> 00:17:10.280
that will counteract it.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:15.860
Then with that also, when they find, it's not done,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:20.400
still they are extremely annoyed.

00:17:22.030 --> 00:17:23.910
So what to do next?

00:17:24.280 --> 00:17:28.910
If you are that unhappy you have to find out something else.

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.400
As I tell a story about children

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:34.570
who were naughty and the mother was going out,

00:17:34.780 --> 00:17:37.410
so she told that "See, you are naughty children,

00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:39.400
so I lock you up in the kitchen"

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:43.490
because anywhere else they can break something, spoil something

00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.490
and she cannot sell them again, perhaps.

00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.410
So, she puts them

00:17:48.610 --> 00:17:51.200
in the kitchen thinking, "What can they ruin there?"

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:56.910
So when she came back, they said, "We ate all your tea leaves!"

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.950
Like that, when they get so frustrated,

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:05.030
they don't know what to do, so they put nails into their ears,

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:10.240
pins into their cheeks, something into their nose

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.110
- they don't know what to do with themselves, you see -

00:18:13.360 --> 00:18:18.400
so they'll pull out their moustaches or they'll paint their hair,

00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:21.780
or do all kinds of funny nonsensical things,

00:18:21.990 --> 00:18:25.400
absolutely frustrated people!

00:18:25.820 --> 00:18:27.450
But the worst part,

00:18:27.660 --> 00:18:33.160
which cannot be understood is, that so confident about it!

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:38.860
They don't do it with any diffidence, it's complete confidence.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.780
Their attention is all over to see "Now, how we should be?",

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:47.240
now if they see a tree which has leaves

00:18:47.610 --> 00:18:52.200
which have become absolutely sort of crumpled down

00:18:52.400 --> 00:18:57.200
because of malnourishment, so they want to be like that.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:01.280
They want to become people who have malnourishment.

00:19:01.450 --> 00:19:03.990
So they look like miserable people.

00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:09.400
Their cheeks are inside, noses outside - sort of thing goes on -

00:19:09.570 --> 00:19:14.660
and if you see them, they look like sickly people.

00:19:15.030 --> 00:19:18.240
That's the sign of finding out

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:24.400
some way of expression of their frustration.

00:19:27.910 --> 00:19:33.280
But Christ paved the way - the other way round.

00:19:33.450 --> 00:19:38.400
He said, "Put chaitanya into your matter",

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:43.700
so you'll enjoy that chaitanya.

00:19:44.450 --> 00:19:50.400
Put chaitanya, the vibrations, into the matter.

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:53.490
This is His message.

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:57.950
He didn't get resurrected only like His spirit going out,

00:19:58.160 --> 00:20:03.200
but the whole His body resurrected Himself.

00:20:03.450 --> 00:20:08.490
So He's talking about

00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:14.570
the resurrection of the body, of the matter, within us.

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:21.280
In Sahaja Yoga also when we come in, kundalini rises,

00:20:21.610 --> 00:20:26.700
She gives you realization, you do feel the chaitanya

00:20:27.030 --> 00:20:30.740
in your hands, you feel it all around,

00:20:31.110 --> 00:20:35.110
your faces shine like beautiful lotuses,

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:40.200
your skin improves, you look blooming, everything is fine,

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:45.910
but still there are material attachments,

00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:50.570
which may be very subtle, could be very gross.

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:56.610
The gross could be like

00:20:57.160 --> 00:21:01.700
"This is my carpet, this is my car,

00:21:02.030 --> 00:21:09.400
this is my ornament" - something like that.

00:21:11.700 --> 00:21:16.530
But if it comes to

00:21:16.910 --> 00:21:19.860
the style of Christ,

00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:25.490
you have to get identified with the matter which is vibrated,

00:21:25.910 --> 00:21:30.360
which is vibrating,

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:35.570
which has got vibrating value -

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:39.740
not material value but vibrating value,

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.740
spiritual value, divine value.

00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:50.860
Could be anything - could be flowers, could be water,

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.030
could be a sari, could be a seat, could be anything

00:21:57.570 --> 00:22:00.070
that becomes valuable.

00:22:00.360 --> 00:22:07.780
So attention starts shifting from gross to vibrations.

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:14.990
But, even now if you have the lurking

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:20.780
attention into material things,

00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:27.700
then it's difficult for you to rise fast.

00:22:29.030 --> 00:22:33.240
Everything that you use,

00:22:33.530 --> 00:22:37.570
is it helpful for your vibrations or not?

00:22:37.860 --> 00:22:43.700
Everything that you do, is it good for your vibrations or not?

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:48.400
Or is it the same old fashion you are carrying?

00:22:48.570 --> 00:22:53.570
Like the mad people I saw yesterday - they had come for holiday

00:22:53.780 --> 00:22:58.410
and they didn't know how to enjoy,

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:00.400
they were trying everything, you see.

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.200
They must have paid lots of money to their tourism,

00:23:05.400 --> 00:23:09.070
poor things, they must have paid lots of money in the hotels,

00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.530
they must have paid lots of money in the restaurant,

00:23:12.910 --> 00:23:15.280
but I felt they were not enjoying at all,

00:23:15.450 --> 00:23:17.700
none of them were enjoying - they were miserable

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:19.660
and they didn't know what to do.

00:23:19.910 --> 00:23:23.780
And at the end of it I was thinking, that they might just go

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:29.360
and break their heads with frustration.

00:23:30.450 --> 00:23:34.110
So matter can never give you joy.

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.320
Only the matter that is vibrated,

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:40.990
that has vibrations, can give you joy.

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.530
A human being can never give you joy,

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.200
may be your wife, may be your children,

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:49.400
may be your father, mother or anyone,

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:54.400
unless and until that person is, has got vibrations,

00:23:54.610 --> 00:23:58.200
because joy is the blessings of God.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:01.200
And unless and until you have connected with God,

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:06.400
whatever you may try, whatever you may acquire,

00:24:06.660 --> 00:24:09.990
you can never have that joy.

00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.950
You may have that artificial confidence,

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.910
because a person who is frustrated has to say

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.820
- show outside that - "Oh no, I'm not frustrated. I am very happy."

00:24:20.030 --> 00:24:24.360
It's like to be tense and say, "I'm very relaxed" - it's like that.

00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:30.360
So, they may just, for keeping up the images,

00:24:30.530 --> 00:24:33.280
might say that "We are very confident",

00:24:33.450 --> 00:24:37.400
but they're very diffident people. They are weak.

00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:43.450
So it could be your children, it could be anyone, any human being.

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.490
Maybe you might think too much of that person,

00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.660
you may be very much identified with that person,

00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.200
you may think that this is the greatest thing,

00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:57.110
greatest person you have ever met, it cannot give you joy.

00:24:57.360 --> 00:25:00.660
But an ordinary person, a laborer,

00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:04.860
maybe a beggar, maybe somebody, a Sadhu,

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:08.860
sitting alone in the forest,

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:11.610
will be such a joy-giving personality.

00:25:11.910 --> 00:25:17.610
He may speak, may not speak, will be such a precious,

00:25:17.990 --> 00:25:19.950
valuable thing for you,

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:25.400
than a person who is rich, well placed, highly adored.

00:25:25.660 --> 00:25:32.070
That's where Christianity has failed, coveting with the kings.

00:25:32.950 --> 00:25:37.530
Now this Mr. Pope here, my husband went and saw him

00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:40.860
and the Pope was very nice to him because he is, comes from a,

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:46.910
he's a big man in the material world. He won't see Me!

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:58.400
Or I may not see him!

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:10.490
So the whole value system, the whole value system has to change,

00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:16.030
and that value system is

00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:20.780
that you care for nothing else but for your spirit.

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.320
Nothing matters but the spirit.

00:26:23.490 --> 00:26:28.400
The spirit gives you the comfort of a palace.

00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:34.700
It gives you the bliss of all the protection.

00:26:37.360 --> 00:26:43.280
It gives you the joy of all the relationships of the world.

00:26:45.490 --> 00:26:50.400
Then why should you care for something which is no good?

00:26:50.570 --> 00:26:52.320
You can see it so clearly.

00:26:52.490 --> 00:26:58.410
If you have your vision clear, you can see it so much around you,

00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:09.240
that these people look so unhappy, so miserable,

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.570
running after this, running after that.

00:27:12.780 --> 00:27:17.400
Now first they were hippies, then they became punks,

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:21.200
now they're becoming well-dressed gentlemen.

00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.320
Everything is from this to that, to that to this,

00:27:24.490 --> 00:27:28.240
leading them nowhere whatsoever.

00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:33.160
So clearly you see that you are away from them.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:37.240
You are in a different realm and you see them.

00:27:37.450 --> 00:27:42.910
So don't go near them.

00:27:43.450 --> 00:27:48.660
Try to show that

00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.070
beauty in you, so that they come to you

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:56.320
and see for yourself, see for themselves,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.400
that you are resurrected people, you are resurrected.

00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:05.860
Spirit is always there in your heart,

00:28:06.110 --> 00:28:10.740
always there, watching you, seeing you,

00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:16.200
but now because the matter that surrounds the spirit

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:21.860
is being resurrected, is being vibrated,

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:27.400
your eyes shine, your skin shines,

00:28:27.570 --> 00:28:33.200
your face shines, you look so beautiful -

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.610
that is what is resurrection.

00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.740
In Sahaja Yoga, there's no place for stupid seriousness.

00:28:43.200 --> 00:28:44.410
What are you serious about?

00:28:44.610 --> 00:28:47.400
"Oh, I have to sell my diamond and you know

00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:53.410
they said there's a little black in it."  So what? Wear it!

00:28:56.950 --> 00:29:02.700
All this seriousness comes from the dead matter in your head,

00:29:03.910 --> 00:29:08.490
and you know on the dead grows the fungus,

00:29:08.780 --> 00:29:14.450
and also you know that this fungus gives you all kinds of diseases.

00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:20.110
So keep away from all that is dead.

00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:24.200
Only the chaitanya makes

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:29.410
the matter vibrate,

00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:32.990
and unless and until you are connected with God,

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.780
you cannot vibrate anything.

00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:43.030
Those great saints, prophets, incarnations who came on this earth

00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:49.240
tried to tell this to all of us, that "get connected with God".

00:29:49.530 --> 00:29:54.110
Everybody said the same thing.

00:29:54.360 --> 00:29:59.400
Of course I have done the job Myself!

00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:03.070
That's good, they're appreciating it.

00:30:03.320 --> 00:30:09.160
And you have to just think about it that

00:30:09.610 --> 00:30:14.360
this connection should not be loose, it should not be disturbed,

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:20.070
it should not be doubting. Fix it up properly.

00:30:21.110 --> 00:30:25.070
Then you will never lose it for anything whatsoever like

00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:28.860
"My wife is like this, my husband is like this,

00:30:29.070 --> 00:30:31.700
my brother is like this".

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:36.660
These are the signs of very weak personalities.

00:30:36.990 --> 00:30:39.570
If you are a strong personality,

00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.700
with those vibrations if you are strong,

00:30:43.030 --> 00:30:46.610
then you make the other person also stronger

00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:49.610
and bring the other person into Sahaja Yoga

00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:53.240
and give him the nectar of life.

00:30:53.410 --> 00:30:56.610
So today is the message that we have to resurrect

00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:02.700
our matter, within and without.

00:31:03.860 --> 00:31:06.820
So you are raising your kundalini upward, is all right.

00:31:07.030 --> 00:31:11.660
Also you have to spread it - horizontally -

00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.700
to your hands, to your feet,

00:31:15.030 --> 00:31:20.530
to your body, to your face, to your thought, to everything.

00:31:20.820 --> 00:31:26.700
What is a mantra is nothing but a thought which is vibrated.

00:31:27.700 --> 00:31:31.030
Any thought that is vibrated is a mantra,

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:37.030
but the vibrations can only be carried by a particular type of,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:42.490
or we can say a particular coefficience is needed.

00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:52.160
In dress, in thinking,

00:31:53.700 --> 00:31:57.610
in anything that is worldly,

00:31:57.950 --> 00:32:02.070
there is a kind of a coefficience that works out the vibrations.

00:32:02.320 --> 00:32:06.280
If that coefficience is not there, you cannot catch the vibrations

00:32:06.450 --> 00:32:11.530
and you cannot also give vibrations.

00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:13.660
So there are only two divergences,

00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:17.280
one is the left, another is the right; there are not too many:

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:19.410
very easy to get rid of them.

00:32:19.610 --> 00:32:26.320
There are only two turns in Italy, one is right or left.

00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:29.400
So in the same way within us

00:32:29.570 --> 00:32:32.030
if you don't go to the left and you don't go to the right,

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:35.950
you keep in the center,

00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.110
you are vibrated! You can vibrate everything!

00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:46.740
But to keep in the center, not to go to any extremes.

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.860
Even in Sahaja Yoga there are people like mad,

00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.490
they meditate for twelve hours.

00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:53.990
What is there to meditate for twelve hours?

00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:57.700
I mean you are already in meditation.

00:32:58.030 --> 00:33:01.950
Or else they will make a picnic out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:02.200 --> 00:33:05.030
One extreme to that.

00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:11.160
What is needed is to think that,

00:33:11.700 --> 00:33:17.530
"I am the spirit and I am connected with God.

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:23.400
How much am I connected? How much I am sucking in?

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:27.700
How much I am getting to it?"

00:33:27.990 --> 00:33:29.360
That's all.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.530
You don't have to do too much about it.

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:36.200
Those days are gone when people used to break their heads,

00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:40.360
stand on their heads or go to Himalayas.

00:33:40.530 --> 00:33:43.160
But peculiarities in temperament

00:33:43.360 --> 00:33:46.200
is not a sign of a good Sahaja Yogi.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:50.110
All the peculiarities come from the matter.

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:54.280
So a peculiar person in Sahaja Yoga,

00:33:54.450 --> 00:33:59.400
maybe he might be bhootish or he might be egoistical.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:02.280
One of the two things in a peculiar person.

00:34:02.450 --> 00:34:04.910
There are no peculiarities in a sahaja yogi.

00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:08.660
There are individualities, but not peculiarities.

00:34:08.910 --> 00:34:13.110
Means everybody will have the nose that he had, it won't change,

00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:15.070
he'll have the eyes which he had,

00:34:15.280 --> 00:34:17.780
but there will be a light in the eye.

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:21.200
In the same way we can see about our clothes -

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.700
we start wearing sober clothes,

00:34:23.910 --> 00:34:27.240
but not pale clothes or dirty clothes:

00:34:27.410 --> 00:34:30.200
we wear colorful things because we are colorful.

00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:34.320
At Sahasrara there are seven colors.

00:34:34.490 --> 00:34:35.860
Today I wore this color,

00:34:36.110 --> 00:34:38.280
because this is the color of spring in India,

00:34:38.450 --> 00:34:40.320
because all the flowers are yellow

00:34:40.490 --> 00:34:42.660
and there is also mustard which is yellow

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:47.110
and this is called as a color of the spring.

00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:53.200
In Indian culture, you see, there's a day on this

00:34:53.400 --> 00:34:59.070
that they wear this particular color to celebrate the spring,

00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:05.160
because we're very sort of connected with the nature.

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:10.200
So today we have received a very nice message

00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:15.990
from New York as if they have dreamt that I'm going to wear

00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.450
a color of the spring,

00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:22.610
so I wish somebody could read it out to you

00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:26.200
what they have said, and you will be surprised how it tallies,

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.400
how it tallies with what I'm wearing today -

00:35:29.610 --> 00:35:31.700
and as soon as I wore this sari

00:35:31.950 --> 00:35:34.660
the thing became hot and I knew this would be.

00:35:34.910 --> 00:35:37.910
That is the moment it became hot and I'm sorry for that,

00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:42.490
because you are finding it rather too much.

00:35:42.860 --> 00:35:46.990
So, today is a day to celebrate the spring

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:49.610
and as you know I was born in spring

00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:54.530
and that Christ was resurrected in spring.

00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:59.490
So the spring starts after the resurrection of Christ.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:03.320
In the same way we are now in the spring mood,

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:06.780
to enjoy, to be happy,

00:36:07.030 --> 00:36:11.280
to be just blissful.

00:36:11.610 --> 00:36:17.570
But not to be frivolous, not to be vulgar, not to be childish.

00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:22.490
That's the way a Sahaja Yogi should be!

00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:28.780
And I'm very happy that at this spontaneous arrangement of Mine

00:36:29.070 --> 00:36:32.410
to come to Rome, so many of you have come.

00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:37.490
It shows how much you love Me and I can't express really

00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:39.820
what I feel about the whole thing,

00:36:40.030 --> 00:36:43.400
except for tears coming to My eyes.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:46.820
For whatever Christ has sacrificed His life,

00:36:47.030 --> 00:36:52.660
which was a terrible thing to happen, that He sacrificed His life,

00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:54.910
He suffered so much,

00:36:55.110 --> 00:36:58.610
but the outcome of that is you - all of you here -

00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:02.570
who are resurrected today and your Agnyas are cleared,

00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.860
and everything is so very fine.

00:37:06.070 --> 00:37:11.240
May God bless you!
