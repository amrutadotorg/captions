WEBVTT

00:00:01.908 --> 00:00:03.333
That They can solve it.

00:00:07.715 --> 00:00:11.615
Despite all this, many people ask me

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:19.050
again and again, what
is the benefit to us?

00:00:20.527 --> 00:00:23.820
There is a very small
hidden thing implicit in

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.700
this question, that we do not have any

00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:34.725
gratitude for what we
have received, we do not

00:00:35.251 --> 00:00:37.680
have the slightest gratitude,
that We think about what we

00:00:37.704 --> 00:00:39.000
have achieved in 'Sahaja way'.

00:00:45.487 --> 00:00:49.270
Upkaar Bhuddhi, which is
called sense of gratitude in English,

00:00:49.624 --> 00:00:51.803
unless you have it within you,

00:00:51.828 --> 00:00:55.288
Nothing will happen;
every thing will fall flat.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.220
Today is an auspicious
day, it is Lalita Panchami,

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.540
Lalit means beautiful, very beautiful, and

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.340
The name of Gauri ji
is, ' Beautiful - Lalita'

00:01:10.664 --> 00:01:12.264
Because Ganeshji was born yesterday,

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.919
Therefore today Gauri
ji's day is celebrated.

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:17.850
Anyway you know that my Kundalini,
 meaning name in Kundli is Lalita.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.930
Elegance is called
'Lalitya'. Man is that beauty,

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.530
Elegance is called
beauty. Human is that beauty,

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.170
The person who does not have even the
slightest sense of gratitude is an animal.

00:01:42.063 --> 00:01:47.960
It is in animals
too, even in dogs.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.840
If you pet a dog, care for 
it few days, see

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.595
You will be amazed that how much 
 loyal and faithful it is.

00:02:02.248 --> 00:02:05.565
As soon as the sense of
gratitude awakens within you,

00:02:05.901 --> 00:02:08.190
that very moment, visions of love
start coming from within.

00:02:10.528 --> 00:02:13.170
Many people say, Mother! we
have surrendered to you.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.120
I laugh, I wonder what you
are going to surrender.

00:02:20.163 --> 00:02:23.080
I didn't ask
anything from you,

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:28.085
just wanted to give.
Nor do I have anything

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.695
else to do with you,
but this God definitely

00:02:31.727 --> 00:02:37.887
sees you whether you have
the wisdom of gratitude or not.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.520
If not, no matter what I recommend for you,

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:49.060
 He doesn't listen.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.600
That's why many people, who think that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.560
they are beyond,
have transcended, are awakedend,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.155
They have evolved a
lot; are still there only.

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:05.839
Just like that, just like
that. Our It is necessary

00:03:05.998 --> 00:03:10.298
to develop the wisdom
of gratitude within.

00:03:11.545 --> 00:03:17.262
Without it everything becomes
ugly,'Lalitya' is lost from it.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.245
Elegance cannot come
in such a person,

00:03:22.845 --> 00:03:28.212
elegance is found only
in that person who has a

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:34.310
sense of gratitude, who should
have the wisdom of gratitude.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:39.190
I don't know what a strange
thing man is, what a strange

00:03:39.215 --> 00:03:43.049
There come Lalitya people;

00:03:46.873 --> 00:03:48.873
Reason of smile on my face!

00:03:48.897 --> 00:03:51.905
thing he is, that he compromises
with himself in such a way

00:03:51.929 --> 00:03:55.329
that he doesn't even recognize
the elegance that is within him.

00:03:55.546 --> 00:03:58.066
And the ugliness within you

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:01.233
Stays with it all
the time, every moment.

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.700
He thinks about living with that.
A very big man, a human being.

00:04:09.787 --> 00:04:11.617
Look from the beginning,

00:04:12.626 --> 00:04:14.690
See from birth that What
has God not done for us?

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:19.973
From animals we have been evolved into

00:04:19.998 --> 00:04:24.838
humans, this whole
creation is so beautiful, so

00:04:26.015 --> 00:04:32.562
beautiful, so organized,
it has been created for us.

00:04:32.606 --> 00:04:35.034
But we have no sense
of gratitude towards them

00:04:35.058 --> 00:04:37.486
We are taking it for
granted, that it is given.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.060
As if we all had the 
to get these things, what if I get them?

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.960
When a man lives in such
falsehood, he cannot even

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.660
see his own filth because
for him the same truth

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:55.559
is not visible. that the truth is
That you are living with your filth.

00:04:55.584 --> 00:04:59.204
You are living on the
dirty elements inside you.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:08.976
He cannot understand it because
he is blind And considering that

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:14.275
blindness as a big thing, he
survives by compromising with it.

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:19.326
We call it a ghost, we call it an
obstacle Say anything, name it anything.

00:05:23.807 --> 00:05:27.107
We all Sahajayogis must develop
this habit in us, that we clean up

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:34.067
our mess. As we have a habit of cleaning
hands no sooner we find them dirty.

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:39.333
Man has learned this. Animals
do not wash their hands quickly.

00:05:40.516 --> 00:05:44.556
humans will wash their
hands quickly, will take bath quickly;

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.318
Will clean his body. How
much dirt is inside our

00:05:47.342 --> 00:05:49.270
mind, that resides
inside, we are living with.

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:52.439
that with we are living and will
continue to live for many births.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.460
If you think that it will end in
this very birth, then it is not right.

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:04.380
This filth will last
for many births and It

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:08.014
will take you to that very
dirty place which we call hell.

00:06:08.453 --> 00:06:13.293
Today is such a beautiful
day that I am not going to

00:06:14.035 --> 00:06:17.936
give you a complete idea of
​​hell, nor do I want to talk about it!

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:22.879
But if there is anything
dirtier than dirtiness in your

00:06:22.904 --> 00:06:27.600
experience, which you would
have as vomitted out at its very sight.

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:32.340
would be that kind of place that
you are creating inside yourself.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:40.530
Yes, mother has given us
awareness, it is okay, we believe in her.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:45.230
Do you believe that you
are doing me a favor? like this

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.790
 They talk, as if 
I am being favoured.

00:06:48.814 --> 00:06:52.114
How come such people evolve !

00:06:53.573 --> 00:06:57.173
Today we are here to
perform Havan of Lord Vishnu.

00:06:59.897 --> 00:07:02.827
Now let us understand
what this havan is.

00:07:03.927 --> 00:07:06.933
The man who sits here with a pure heart, is
going be benifitted.

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.283
one who sits here with an impure mind
is not going to be affected in any way.

00:07:10.417 --> 00:07:14.340
For him it is a useless
thing. havan or puja, Prayers,

00:07:14.364 --> 00:07:18.174
namaz, chanting mantras,
tantra etc. everything.

00:07:18.175 --> 00:07:22.335
Tantra means a dirty thing.

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:26.840
Kundalini Itself is not that.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:33.220
shows us that path

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.680
It illuminates the path
on which we have to ascend.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.600
If you shine it, suddenly
triggering occurs.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:55.550
suddenly in our life
the thing gets triggered.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:08:00.090
Like we jump right away.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:04.660
From this limited life we ​​jump
suddenly into the limitless one.

00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:09.360
The havan is for Shri Vishnu,
entire Bombay city will be benefitted.

00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:12.930
Because I am
going to worship with my own hands.

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:19.570
Havan of Shri Vishnu means that Shri
Vishnu is the coordinator of our evolution,

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:26.980
He himself rose up to be Shri Krishna.

00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:31.659
Through this ritual of Shri
Vishnu we trigger the whole world,

00:08:31.659 --> 00:08:36.620
make it glow.

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:41.400
A new kind of vibrations
can be raised in it,

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:46.960
So that man's vision goes
towards his evolution and

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:51.880
The three dimensions In the
three whirls in which he is trapped

00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:57.570
from its bonds,

00:08:57.570 --> 00:09:02.470
he should be freed
from its bondage.

00:09:02.470 --> 00:09:07.470
But it should also be
understood that  what God

00:09:07.470 --> 00:09:12.350
is going to 
gain from enslaved people.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:20.170
How can one who is
a slave salute God?

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:26.220
To get free of all the bondages

00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.180
We know that you don't have
the strength to leave all that.  .

00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:37.060
But you just kept the
preparation, we will throw it.

00:09:37.060 --> 00:09:41.820
Be prepared from today that “All
that fallshood, I am carrying within me,

00:09:41.820 --> 00:09:46.560
I will throw it away. You
cannot benefit Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.420
Your welfare has to be done
through Sahaja yoga; You think that we

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:55.880
If you have come for the welfare of Sahajog
then you are under great misconception.

00:09:55.880 --> 00:10:02.680
Because Sahaja Yoga
is self realization of God.

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.220
Only the one who wants to take it
and who wants to grow can move ahead.

00:10:07.220 --> 00:10:12.180
And whoever comes here to give, Can't
get it here, giving it is another thing.

00:10:14.901 --> 00:10:17.160
One should be obliged
towards Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:20.340
Obliging means

00:10:20.340 --> 00:10:25.340
The feeling should be that

00:10:25.340 --> 00:10:30.520
We were so greatly
blessed that transcended.

00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:35.480
We got complete
realization of Kundalini,

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.180
And we are raising the Kundalini
on the directions of the fingers.

00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:43.940
Who else can dare do that You
must have seen many people talking,

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.860
But the people, who can make the Kundalinis

00:10:48.860 --> 00:10:53.520
dance on the finger-tips are
sitting here, should know that

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:58.500
To what extent
you must bow before God?

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:03.320
We need and should be greatful
to Him that O Lord, how about us?

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:08.320
What is our special
thing for which

00:11:08.320 --> 00:11:13.300
You did us such a favor,
why did you do this to us?

00:11:13.300 --> 00:11:20.240
How did Lord come?

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:25.120
What was our standi?
What have we done?

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:28.840
What such virtues were added to us
for which you came upon us like this

00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:34.110
And laid out the entire
Kundalini in front of us.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:39.090
All its knowledge, from subtle
to subtle, is present in you all.

00:11:39.090 --> 00:11:44.050
Leave aside the fools.
You talk about great fools,

00:11:47.150 --> 00:11:53.410
Those who think that
they have grown up.

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:56.890
You guys have come here to be fools, or
knowledgeable; Come with the thought !

00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:01.830
I didn't come here to make
fun of you or by tempting you

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:06.530
Make fun of you and I make
fool of you and make you people suffer.

00:12:07.903 --> 00:12:13.480
You actually have
to climb that ladder.

00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:18.260
There is only one way, half-heartedly
Don't come. Do wholehearted surrender.

00:12:20.210 --> 00:12:25.190
With all my heart, Lord, how much you have
Gave it to us, what should we do for you?

00:12:27.142 --> 00:12:29.970
Sometimes you people
ask for worldly things,

00:12:31.525 --> 00:12:33.530
They ask for power,
they ask for money.

00:12:35.308 --> 00:12:38.291
You people are still
entangled in small things.

00:12:38.818 --> 00:12:42.610
The Supreme Being that I talk
about is the one who sees everything.

00:12:43.084 --> 00:12:46.441
Yoga, Kshem, Vahamyaham have
been said, I will take care of you.

00:12:46.891 --> 00:12:51.173
What is there in the world
greater than this Supreme element?

00:12:55.446 --> 00:13:04.646
Which can even stand in comparison to the
element on the basis of which everything

00:13:05.963 --> 00:13:10.533
When it sinks in, it

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:16.370
After attaining the nectar, what would you
talk with me to drink the drainage water?

00:13:21.174 --> 00:13:24.834
That's why the shadow of his
blessings upon you,

00:13:25.026 --> 00:13:29.486
 it is not felt,

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.740
You don't seem to know about it,

00:13:33.764 --> 00:13:35.764
Because you're still
taking the dip  on the shore.

00:13:36.514 --> 00:13:40.569
In today's session of
Shri Vishnu, meditate in

00:13:40.593 --> 00:13:45.100
mind that this is being
done for you (evolution),

00:13:45.356 --> 00:13:49.456
I don't need
anything, not only that,

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:54.320
Today in
atmosphere of Bombay city,

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:59.400
These vibrations will go and
glow. Because of these waves

00:13:59.400 --> 00:14:03.680
all over the city of Bombay

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:09.680
The Vishnumayi sparks of 
evolution have been lit.

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.960
It should be understood that
this is a very important thing.

00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:17.953
Today you guys may
be ten five man siting  here

00:14:18.103 --> 00:14:25.410
But all of you should 
be here with full concentration.

00:14:25.410 --> 00:14:29.750
Concentrate completely here
and don't look here and there.

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:34.710
A man comes and your eyes
goes there, keep your mind here.

00:14:34.710 --> 00:14:39.310
Keep yourself completely dedicated,
it will happen only when you seek;

00:14:39.310 --> 00:14:41.208
Nothing is going to
happen unless you ask for

00:14:41.232 --> 00:14:43.130
it, nothing is going
to happen on my part.

00:14:43.130 --> 00:14:44.298
Incarnations also,

00:14:45.898 --> 00:14:52.640
What has been asked for, only
happens; no one has free time here.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:57.560
To descend and take the trouble.

00:14:57.560 --> 00:14:59.900
It should be understood
in the statement itself that

00:14:59.924 --> 00:15:02.540
your demand Is. But why are
those who ask so incomplete?

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:12.140
turn your full attention here;
Devote your entire conscious here.

00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:16.900
And our havan today
can be very successful.

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.020
Many works can be accomplished from this.
We performed a similar havan in London.

00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:25.840
its great results  were just 
amazing in London. The entire environment

00:15:25.840 --> 00:15:30.020
changed; What is needed is to change
the environment, the atmosphere here

00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:35.000
will get awakened; Sometimes
so much vibrations flow from

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:37.072
my body but they go
into the atmosphere

00:15:37.096 --> 00:15:39.880
unabsorbed because the
environment won't take it.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:44.760
You people also get
it after being fully awake.

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:49.220
set your vibrations 
right first. Bow down,

00:15:51.110 --> 00:15:57.740
invoke and

00:15:57.740 --> 00:16:03.640
When he descends, and gets awakened

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.640
you absorb it in. All the
stuff here, that is here

00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:11.720
Using these materials you are only praying

00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:16.640
that we
are grateful to you

00:16:17.460 --> 00:16:21.940
You have many favors on us,
we are showing you this, take this

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:25.840
wood sticks, you gave us we
are offering you. how can we say?

00:16:26.180 --> 00:16:31.370
This is the meaning of Havan and

00:16:31.370 --> 00:16:36.220
Along with that, because of
that benevolent intelligence

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:40.160
Because of that sense of gratitude in you
Let all the negativities inside burn away

00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:44.760
in this fire. And may
this fire purify you,

00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:52.170
If you are giving these
things here in this spirit.

00:16:52.170 --> 00:16:57.070
Its no difficult work, there is
nothing difficult, we are here with you

00:16:57.070 --> 00:17:01.430
stood up to see everything.
To know everything

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:06.130
Sometimes she consoles you, sometimes
she scolds you, sometimes she loves you,

00:17:06.130 --> 00:17:07.860
Just like a mother should.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:18.540
Children should understand that If
Mother is saying something for our good

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:23.420
So only mother can do
this and no one else can do it

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:28.100
You should think that this is your
ultimate destiny and be grateful.

00:17:28.100 --> 00:17:32.890
This thing is needed.

00:17:34.470 --> 00:17:38.970
Because behind all this is there is 
mother's love, she has to tell you.

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:43.610
You must recognize and if you can not
appreciate love Sahaja Yoga for you is

00:17:43.610 --> 00:17:47.180
useless because it
is all a philosophy of love.

00:17:50.954 --> 00:17:56.371
You see love in each other.

00:17:58.337 --> 00:18:01.354
But until you completely
cleanse your mind and

00:18:01.596 --> 00:18:06.284
won't be able to see
yourself in the mirror of others

00:18:06.308 --> 00:18:10.725
you won't be able to
recognize that love either.

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:15.540
Your own distorted
version, that you see in

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:20.700
others and
consider others to be a parody. I hope,

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:25.210
It's hoped, I hope now I have also

00:18:25.210 --> 00:18:31.860
started
talking that this Yagya,

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:36.040
With this Havan our hearts

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:40.780
come clean and in our evolution

00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:45.380
You will get a lot of help and that you
stick like this on the shore of limitless.

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:49.850
Go in a way that there will be
no talk of returning from there.

00:18:58.150 --> 00:19:02.450
It is a very auspicious
day and Ganeshji

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:07.250
must be understood that Ganeshji
recognizes none the else, except

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:12.190
Mother in the Universe.
And hence

00:19:12.190 --> 00:19:17.270
Occupies
the highest position.

00:19:17.270 --> 00:19:22.430
Completely devoted to his mother,
wouldn't his mother ever scolded him?

00:19:22.430 --> 00:19:27.110
She would never have made Him
understand ? Accepted everything.

00:19:27.110 --> 00:19:31.350
Remembering that Lord Ganesha
we now perform our havan.

00:19:31.350 --> 00:19:36.310
Will complete it fully and
you all also participate in it.

00:19:36.310 --> 00:19:40.910
Be fully involved and remain
seated without any doubts.

00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:45.810
Because most of you are realized
, and those who are not realized

00:19:45.810 --> 00:19:49.370
they will also benefitted. It will
definitely happen, certainly happen.
