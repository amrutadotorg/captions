00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:23.390
secondly I have to tell you that the

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.700
women in the West have changed their

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:29.160
styles which is very very dangerous for

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.890
their society because they have also

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.790
taken to the egoistical ways of men

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.000
so if men have gone say ten feet

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.600
they have run after them again about say

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.309
eight feet and pull back men even to go

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:51.840
further that now this is completely

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:55.710
crossing your egos because women do not

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.320
have such possibility fevers normally so

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.660
competing men in ego what you did you

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.230
have lost your complete maryadas of a

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.410
woman

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.470
there's no Maria de Ojo man has a

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.409
maryada of a man if a man start leaving

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.760
like a woman he is not a man in the same

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.000
way the women if they start behaving

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.880
like men then there are no more women

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.250
there lost her maryadas they are out so

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.830
they get possessed and that's why women

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:28.050
when they are egoistical they become

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:30.150
horrid their face has become horrid they

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.690
look horrid their whole behavior is

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:37.200
horrid they can become dry like beans

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:40.110
Dixie and could be so hard as to hit you

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.410
like an iron rod they say the lady

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.600
retire in a rod in Iraq all these

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.930
happens because we have a Maria

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.560
we are the style as we are if it Sara

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.060
Rue's it suppose be happy that you are a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.730
flower of rose

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.730
now the rose wants to become the thought

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:09.410
so we lose all our maryadas to that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.870
today I will be speaking to you before

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.970
we start this here when the people are

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:16.550
coming before that to the ladies and

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:19.849
tell them what's gone wrong with them

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:23.870
and that is how you must know that the

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:30.489
plight of the West is not by men but by

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:33.530
women women have ruined the Society of

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:36.650
Western society is the Indian women who

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:39.140
have kept the society intact all my

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:44.330
really thanks to their self solid

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:47.500
behavior towards life it is the women of

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.500
this country who have ruined all that

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:54.950
was so delicate emotional beautiful love

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.810
affixed and compassion women are there

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:02.810
to give joy and happiness and emotional

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:07.519
security to the whole society while they

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.840
take over do they keep that do that even

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.989
the husbands have become just like

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.730
servants in the house you haven't done

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.600
the cleaning properly you haven't

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.350
cleaned the kitchen properly I went to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:23.420
England I was surprised all kitchen

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.040
cleaning and all that is so well done in

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.840
England we see you have everything for

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.150
cleaning days cleaning that I said why

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.590
it has happened is the men you see they

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.840
had to do it so they found out all the

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.720
ways and methods has to be sparking all

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.120
right [ __ ] you up I'll get you such a

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:44.180
thing that if you put you in your hand

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.890
you're having burn all the acid with a

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:49.420
big glove in the hand put it everywhere

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:54.530
[Laughter]

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:58.250
then the children you see suffer because

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:01.280
that's the job of a gardener beautiful

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.079
things that are born to be looked after

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.760
with that kindness but you overindulge

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.829
into your children in the beginning a

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.190
mother is like a gardener she has to

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:12.190
prove

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.709
chef's to cut also so the growth is all

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.670
right if your child is pointy or no good

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.670
another useless yeah

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.050
but you grow me your husband not your

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.070
children justa the Waya because ego is

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.800
towards her husband all the time

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.320
grooming six-year go there what these

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:40.050
money business give me all the money i

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.150
keep all the money everything now one

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.170
may say that the law is such if the law

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.630
is stupid

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:48.390
the sahaja yoginis should not take to

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:50.370
such a level that law has ruined you all

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:54.060
I think because this is such an

00:04:50.370 --> 00:05:00.960
important part of life it is such an

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:06.230
important area of life that it should

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:11.100
not have suffered where affection love

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.040
kindness all that is required is missing

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:17.010
then you become people without any

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.150
meaning life is endless you don't know

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:24.030
what to do that's why the children

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:25.740
commit suicide and then the laughs

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.260
should be such that she should be true

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.820
for that you must have wisdom which also

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:32.700
one does not develop because if you run

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.180
after your mooladhara chakra how can you

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.180
have it stuff

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:44.180
here men have befooled you completely

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:49.230
completely there before take it from me

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:50.940
you must keep your wisdom intact and not

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:54.050
only that they have be fully but they

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:56.610
themselves have stooped down to the food

00:05:54.050 --> 00:06:01.710
so they have their devious methods they

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:04.110
are not straightforward so i sahaja

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:06.410
Yogi's we are above all these things we

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:09.780
have reached a state where we are above

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.130
we are here for correcting all those

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:13.230
things that have gone wrong in the

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.850
society because sahaja yoga faces

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:17.730
towards a society not towards yourself

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:19.470
only so at this stage we have to

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:22.500
understand what we have to do is first

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:26.430
of all our own understanding should be

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:28.710
such even now with all this movement of

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.020
sahaja yoga understanding women don't

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.979
realize that they have to be like women

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:36.220
I have seen that they still what's wrong

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.340
still go

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:48.850
and men don't understand that they have

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:51.340
to be like men even after so and if they

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:54.730
become really like men women will

00:06:51.340 --> 00:07:00.220
appreciate them and if you become really

00:06:54.730 --> 00:07:02.800
like women men will appreciate you this

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:08.320
is the opposites that attracts each

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.900
other that should be no but we live in

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:16.960
abnormal way that the men are women and

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:21.370
women are men what do you do that so it

00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.930
is very important for men to understand

00:07:21.370 --> 00:07:26.380
now because I'm going to talk to women

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:29.710
it at all that they should become like

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.260
men they must fix up things they must

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:35.770
take decisions they must be the one who

00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:39.070
must true but that's outward actually

00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:41.830
it's the source is the woman the woman

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:44.340
is the potential and man is the kinetic

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:48.220
for example there is a fan moving

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:50.650
movement of the fan is the kinetic force

00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:54.250
you can say but the potential force that

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:56.440
is within us is the one which is the

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:59.020
electricity which is coming from the

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:02.860
source which is higher the fan that

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:06.610
moves or the source let the women decide

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:08.560
and Men understand but if that source

00:08:06.610 --> 00:08:14.140
dries out and wants to become the fan no

00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:17.500
fan will one upside down situation if

00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:19.240
you realize you are the source you are

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:22.300
the one who is going to give all the

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:25.630
Shakti to man will stop behaving like

00:08:22.300 --> 00:08:27.520
men it doesn't mean that you cannot go

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.880
to work you cannot do but take to work

00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:32.620
which is more suitable to women like I

00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:38.500
would not like a woman to have a bus

00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:42.880
driver job or a truck driver or wrestler

00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:42.880
[Laughter]

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:49.290
no I'm not telling empty from experience

00:08:50.190 --> 00:08:55.660
once I was Charlie I was a student at

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:58.390
that time in Lahore you see and I'ma

00:08:55.660 --> 00:09:01.029
start travelling by train and at some

00:08:58.390 --> 00:09:05.860
station you see the train stopped in the

00:09:01.029 --> 00:09:07.959
night and a lady came and she said open

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:11.020
the door for me so I said it's so

00:09:07.959 --> 00:09:12.730
crowded all right I'll try I try and she

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:14.440
said if you don't open I can break it I

00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:16.450
said how can you said you don't know why

00:09:14.440 --> 00:09:19.149
I said you I said she said I'm Mohammed

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:21.450
Amano sousou-sama da moneh the wrestler

00:09:19.149 --> 00:09:24.520
lady Obama I said tango

00:09:21.450 --> 00:09:25.570
I said if you are a wrestler lady why

00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:27.610
are you coming in there ladies

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:33.940
Department why don't you go to the men's

00:09:27.610 --> 00:09:36.130
and she pushed the door so violently she

00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:43.810
came up I looked at her I said wow what

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:48.370
a person and she sat down you see with

00:09:43.810 --> 00:09:51.370
the hole hole hole her countenance and

00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:53.200
everything her old was a gate and state

00:09:51.370 --> 00:09:54.880
of sitting everything was so manly like

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:57.010
that she said are you not come Alana

00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:59.140
those who want to say I should not sit

00:09:57.010 --> 00:10:01.660
here I said nobody wants that now madam

00:09:59.140 --> 00:10:03.370
you seek comfort but we'll have to get

00:10:01.660 --> 00:10:08.890
somebody from the other compartment to

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:11.950
have wrestling I bet she was quieted and

00:10:08.890 --> 00:10:14.230
she was really I've saw her all her

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:17.820
muscles so over developed and she was

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:21.120
really looking like I would say a

00:10:17.820 --> 00:10:25.509
Western cow we can say

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:28.699
[Laughter]

00:10:25.509 --> 00:10:33.350
like the Gaussian look like buffaloes

00:10:28.699 --> 00:10:35.000
not like cows something very funny I

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:39.380
cannot forget that you see that it's

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:41.930
fear I was very young I really felt like

00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:49.610
laughing but I laugh I thought she walks

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:52.160
by so this is what it is that we are

00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:54.050
ending up there must know that how far

00:10:52.160 --> 00:11:00.459
are we going are we going to become

00:10:54.050 --> 00:11:03.380
wrestlers so this is what it is

00:11:00.459 --> 00:11:06.230
one has to learn that it has been there

00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:10.550
for ages ages it has been there I have

00:11:06.230 --> 00:11:12.949
seen have read books some books old

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:15.380
books I have seen some films also where

00:11:12.949 --> 00:11:16.880
they have shown even in olden times the

00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:19.279
women used to have room in their hand

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:21.470
sitting there husband sort of thing we

00:11:19.279 --> 00:11:25.810
do have some of them blessed in India

00:11:21.470 --> 00:11:29.300
but very very few very few women take

00:11:25.810 --> 00:11:31.970
not a big number but it faint rings got

00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:34.970
those see so keep your fingers crossed

00:11:31.970 --> 00:11:37.579
but I would say that this is what is

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:40.040
happening so with too much ego of man

00:11:37.579 --> 00:11:43.100
which goes into left to GD they say not

00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:44.930
let the women take over all right can be

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:47.630
satisfied no more of their aggression

00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:50.720
let them have their own so they do what

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:53.209
they like men are not bothered and they

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:56.149
go into their left this thing there's no

00:11:53.209 --> 00:11:59.360
enjoyment of marriage or now so now we

00:11:56.149 --> 00:12:01.760
have yesterday the other marriage for

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:03.829
the benefit of your children for the

00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:07.760
goodness of them all that take your

00:12:03.829 --> 00:12:10.630
roles as women and men your roles are as

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:14.449
women and men and you see you'll enjoy

00:12:10.630 --> 00:12:16.220
the quarrel should be on that road the

00:12:14.449 --> 00:12:18.439
man wants to do something worried should

00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:21.380
say no no no how can even that's too

00:12:18.439 --> 00:12:23.630
much for me let me do this work as I

00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:25.550
have told you many a times how my

00:12:23.630 --> 00:12:27.920
husband when he gets angry he wants to

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:30.850
wash his undershirt to see to show his

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:39.370
anger or when he is very angry

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:45.490
then he will clean the bathroom but he

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:47.260
does it so badly that I know that it is

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.660
he has done I feel like laughing but I

00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:53.290
dare not because I must keep his spirit

00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:56.590
on then and then he starts talking in

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:58.690
you know in a very is he a respectable

00:12:56.590 --> 00:13:01.450
way to everyone now he calls everyone

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:03.910
Tao you see now he says Dao are like

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:06.580
that now are like that so I know now

00:13:03.910 --> 00:13:08.560
he's a really angry for something but he

00:13:06.580 --> 00:13:11.650
won't say what what she's here angry me

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:14.350
see then we have to find out what is he

00:13:11.650 --> 00:13:16.830
angry with and if so don't feel guilty

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:16.830
correct

00:13:16.950 --> 00:13:22.990
now you must find out what are the weak

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:26.500
points of your husband first of all and

00:13:22.990 --> 00:13:26.890
of your wife on what points she get

00:13:26.500 --> 00:13:28.690
upset

00:13:26.890 --> 00:13:30.310
now the attitude should be we should not

00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:32.800
upset her we should not make her angry

00:13:30.310 --> 00:13:35.980
and another attitude of the wife the

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.470
same way much more for the hospital so

00:13:35.980 --> 00:13:41.080
now what are the soft points on which

00:13:38.470 --> 00:13:44.380
she really gets upset just turn it it's

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:44.920
very simple aliphatic don't take it

00:13:44.380 --> 00:13:47.500
seriously

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:51.250
but be careful to avoid that now also

00:13:47.500 --> 00:13:53.320

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:55.270

settles down in your mind that's how you

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.730
