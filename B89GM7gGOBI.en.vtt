00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:06.761
Navaratri Puja, Cabella Ligure, Italy
27th September, 1992

00:00:57.743 --> 00:01:02.868
Today is the first day of Navaratri.

00:01:04.743 --> 00:01:09.243
And when I found that the rain was there

00:01:09.576 --> 00:01:13.243
and all kinds of problems,

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.118
and Vishnumaya was suggesting some things,

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:20.243
I just consulted the calendar,

00:01:21.035 --> 00:01:25.035
and you will be amazed to know that in the calendar

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.285
it is written that till five forty-five it’s not auspicious –

00:01:30.701 --> 00:01:32.285
it’s inauspicious.

00:01:32.868 --> 00:01:35.076
After five forty-five only

00:01:39.743 --> 00:01:42.202
the right thing starts,

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.368
so just imagine, by calculation how it was correct

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:55.784
that five forty-five we had to have this puja,

00:01:56.118 --> 00:01:58.243
after five forty-five.

00:01:58.493 --> 00:02:02.410
That is, the first day of Navaratri starts in Italy

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:06.410
or in Europe after five forty-five.

00:02:06.826 --> 00:02:09.285
So it is something one must understand that

00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:13.452
the Chaitanya is working out everything,

00:02:13.743 --> 00:02:15.493
and it is giving all the suggestions;

00:02:16.076 --> 00:02:18.618
because I had not at all seen the, what you call the

00:02:18.618 --> 00:02:20.327
tithi (auspicious time),

00:02:20.327 --> 00:02:22.285
but I just felt that, I said that we’ll have it

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:23.743
in the evening.

00:02:24.076 --> 00:02:25.743
And when I said it, I said “Let’s see this,”

00:02:25.743 --> 00:02:27.784
and there it was.

00:02:28.452 --> 00:02:30.910
There’s so many things we have to see,

00:02:32.492 --> 00:02:38.701
that whatever has been revealed to you, you can verify it.

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.492
For example, I had said long time back

00:02:43.285 --> 00:02:47.951
that Mooladhara Chakra is made out of carbon,

00:02:48.285 --> 00:02:49.910
carbon atom,

00:02:50.576 --> 00:02:58.160
and if you see it from left to the right – right to the left,

00:02:58.701 --> 00:03:04.743
left side you see nothing but a swastika.

00:03:05.743 --> 00:03:09.492
So, now you see from left to the right,

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:12.868
then you see Omkara;

00:03:13.243 --> 00:03:16.160
and once you see from down below upward,

00:03:17.118 --> 00:03:21.659
you see the alpha and omega.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.493
Now see, Christ has said that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.701
“I am the Alpha and the Omega.”

00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:33.576
So this swastika becomes Omkara,

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:38.743
also becomes Christ.

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.618
You can see it very clearly.

00:03:41.868 --> 00:03:46.368
Now we have got a beautiful picture of that,

00:03:46.993 --> 00:03:49.868
we have a tape, and I wanted to see you all that,

00:03:50.202 --> 00:03:52.452
but I don’t know how we can manage here.

00:03:52.452 --> 00:03:55.910
But I wish you all could see it, it’s so clear-cut.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:02.247
So alpha and omega, also these mathematical things

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:06.611
have come to us from

00:04:08.493 --> 00:04:11.743
inside, from the Divine.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.076
This is not we have created.

00:04:14.493 --> 00:04:20.534
This was found out by some mathematicians

00:04:20.951 --> 00:04:22.951
who were realized souls,

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:26.993
and they used this alpha and omega.

00:04:27.493 --> 00:04:31.327
It’s surprising how it shows so clearly that

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:33.701
swastika becoming Omkar,

00:04:33.993 --> 00:04:38.701
and Omkar then becoming alpha and omega.

00:04:39.118 --> 00:04:44.951
So everything in Sahaja Yoga is tangible and

00:04:45.285 --> 00:04:47.826
can be verified.

00:04:48.493 --> 00:04:54.993
Now you are worshipping today the Durga,

00:04:55.493 --> 00:04:59.659
or all the nine forms of the Goddess.

00:05:00.534 --> 00:05:06.072
She came nine times on this Earth, according to this, that

00:05:06.493 --> 00:05:11.118
She fought all the people who were destroying

00:05:11.743 --> 00:05:14.118
the seekers,

00:05:14.154 --> 00:05:19.951
who were trying to make a mess of their lives.

00:05:20.784 --> 00:05:26.651
And these tortured saints,

00:05:26.743 --> 00:05:30.467
when they prayed to the Goddess – because none of the

00:05:30.492 --> 00:05:38.348
gods could do anything, and Sadashiva is never interfering

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:40.951
with what the Goddess is doing –

00:05:41.327 --> 00:05:44.368
so they worshipped the Bhagawati,

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:49.220
and then the incarnation of Hers came nine times,

00:05:49.368 --> 00:05:53.452
according to the need of the time.

00:05:54.701 --> 00:05:57.883
So every time you find Her confronting people who are

00:05:57.908 --> 00:06:01.885
extremely arrogant, self-opinionated,

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.285
thinking no end of themselves;

00:06:05.743 --> 00:06:11.230
and the bhaktas are tortured by these self-opinionated

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:14.701
horrible rakshasas.

00:06:14.993 --> 00:06:18.327
Now, in India when we cast the horoscope of a person,

00:06:18.327 --> 00:06:20.493
we have three categories of people:

00:06:20.784 --> 00:06:23.534
one are the devas, they’re called dev;

00:06:24.993 --> 00:06:29.463
the second ones are the ones which are manavas,

00:06:29.576 --> 00:06:31.534
means human beings;

00:06:31.784 --> 00:06:33.701
and the third ones are rakshasas.

00:06:34.826 --> 00:06:40.243
So I think I have got all of you from the dev categories,

00:06:40.492 --> 00:06:42.801
because you could not have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:06:42.826 --> 00:06:45.493
that seriously unless and until you were there.

00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:48.868
After all, why should you believe Me also that

00:06:49.015 --> 00:06:51.826
when I say that there was the Durga, and there was

00:06:51.851 --> 00:06:56.202
this thing, and She did this and did that?

00:06:56.618 --> 00:07:00.618
It’s not that from one faith you have come out and now

00:07:00.710 --> 00:07:03.618
you are jumping onto another faith; it’s not like that.

00:07:03.868 --> 00:07:09.452
It is actually been proved – you can feel.

00:07:09.701 --> 00:07:12.843
For example, when you are raising the Kundalini

00:07:12.868 --> 00:07:15.285
on the center Heart,

00:07:15.826 --> 00:07:18.659
you can feel

00:07:19.035 --> 00:07:22.160
that on the center Heart if there is a catch,

00:07:22.492 --> 00:07:25.826
you have to take name of the Jagadamba.

00:07:26.618 --> 00:07:30.160
Unless and until you take Her name it won’t open out.

00:07:30.410 --> 00:07:33.767
Also when I am clearing out your center Heart,

00:07:33.826 --> 00:07:39.452
I have to also say, “Now I am in reality Jagadamba,”

00:07:39.743 --> 00:07:44.368
and then the Jagadamba within you awakens.

00:07:44.618 --> 00:07:47.343
So now you have verified it much more

00:07:47.368 --> 00:07:49.452
than the scientists have done.

00:07:49.452 --> 00:07:52.701
The scientists are going from outside,

00:07:53.118 --> 00:07:55.093
and they are not conclusive at all.

00:07:55.118 --> 00:07:57.659
Now if you have one problem, they will work it out;

00:07:58.118 --> 00:08:00.035
another problem – they work out problems,

00:08:00.368 --> 00:08:03.160
but they don’t know the basics,

00:08:03.492 --> 00:08:07.618
what the problems are, and where lies the solution.

00:08:08.035 --> 00:08:15.327
While you can see that once the Amba, this Kundalini

00:08:15.951 --> 00:08:19.784
who is the reflection of the Holy Ghost,

00:08:20.202 --> 00:08:22.868
of the Adi Shakti within you,

00:08:23.017 --> 00:08:28.160
when She rises through these different chakras,

00:08:28.701 --> 00:08:31.784
She gives them power because She’s the Power,

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:33.784
She’s the Shakti.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:38.910
She is the desire power of Sadashiva.

00:08:40.492 --> 00:08:44.160
She is the complete power of Sadashiva.

00:08:44.701 --> 00:08:48.578
And so She gives the power totally to every chakra,

00:08:48.701 --> 00:08:52.076
by which all these chakras are enlightened

00:08:52.452 --> 00:08:54.743
and all the deities are awakened.

00:08:55.202 --> 00:08:58.868
Supposing we have no power of life,

00:08:59.202 --> 00:09:01.492
we’ll be like dead people.

00:09:02.327 --> 00:09:05.968
So these centers when they receive this power,

00:09:05.993 --> 00:09:08.784
this Shakti, then they are awakened.

00:09:09.035 --> 00:09:11.993
Now you have seen it, you can do it yourself.

00:09:12.285 --> 00:09:14.118
It’s all tangible,

00:09:14.534 --> 00:09:17.576
you can verify it.

00:09:17.988 --> 00:09:24.285
I have told you that She resides on the Heart center.

00:09:24.576 --> 00:09:27.202
Now see how Heart center is placed –

00:09:27.202 --> 00:09:29.202
also very interesting to see.

00:09:29.951 --> 00:09:35.968
While She is Jagadamba; but the Amba, means the pure

00:09:35.993 --> 00:09:42.452
form of power, resides in the triangular bone,

00:09:42.743 --> 00:09:44.426
like Kundalini.

00:09:44.577 --> 00:09:48.676
But Her form which is Jagadamba,

00:09:48.701 --> 00:09:53.035
where She is the Mother of the Universe,

00:09:53.410 --> 00:09:57.410
She resides on the Heart center.

00:09:58.035 --> 00:10:02.035
Now this Heart center is very important.

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:07.593
When – I have already told you this, that when a child

00:10:07.618 --> 00:10:12.118
is about, till the twelve years of age,

00:10:12.534 --> 00:10:17.993
this center produces the ganas.

00:10:18.868 --> 00:10:24.368
Ganas are the workers on the left-hand side.

00:10:24.743 --> 00:10:29.910
They are like, we can say St. Michael is their leader,

00:10:30.452 --> 00:10:39.776
but their king is Ganapati, Ganesha.

00:10:41.410 --> 00:10:45.993
So first She has done is the ghatasthapana.

00:10:46.285 --> 00:10:49.327
“Ghatasthapana” means – you have done here now,

00:10:49.534 --> 00:10:52.826
this is the ghatasthapana (pot with coconut)

00:10:52.826 --> 00:10:54.868
This is the kumbha.

00:10:54.933 --> 00:10:57.826
Now this kumbha She has established first:

00:10:58.076 --> 00:10:59.701
that is the triangular bone.

00:10:59.701 --> 00:11:04.386
Now this is Her first work, that to establish this,

00:11:04.452 --> 00:11:06.452
your Mooladhara.

00:11:06.541 --> 00:11:10.743
So She established within you is innocence.

00:11:11.076 --> 00:11:14.452
She established innocence within you to begin with.

00:11:14.743 --> 00:11:19.868
So She has put this ghata in which She is staying

00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:21.910
as Kundalini now.

00:11:22.009 --> 00:11:27.594
So the first is that to establish the Kundalini

00:11:27.743 --> 00:11:32.492
in the triangular bone, and then to establish Shri Ganesha.

00:11:32.743 --> 00:11:38.035
This is the first work, by which whatever She is going

00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:41.822
to create now –

00:11:42.123 --> 00:11:47.368
all the Universes, the Earth, everything –

00:11:47.784 --> 00:11:51.926
whatever She is going to create has to be filled with

00:11:51.951 --> 00:11:54.493
innocence.

00:11:54.743 --> 00:11:59.285
Now if you see the stones,

00:11:59.618 --> 00:12:02.076
they’re innocent.

00:12:02.951 --> 00:12:04.926
If you hit the stone you’ll get the hit,

00:12:04.951 --> 00:12:07.743
otherwise it doesn’t come up and hit you.

00:12:08.118 --> 00:12:10.202
They’re innocent.

00:12:11.076 --> 00:12:17.910
If you see the rivers, they’re innocent.

00:12:19.534 --> 00:12:24.243
Everything that has been created as matter is innocent.

00:12:24.826 --> 00:12:29.593
It is not cunning, it is not manipulating,

00:12:29.618 --> 00:12:32.493
it is not aggressive – nothing of the kind.

00:12:32.951 --> 00:12:34.035
They’re innocent,

00:12:34.410 --> 00:12:38.951
means they’re under the complete order of God Almighty.

00:12:39.202 --> 00:12:43.017
They do not have their own free will to do what they like.

00:12:44.534 --> 00:12:50.718
Whatever is done is with the absolutely under complete

00:12:50.743 --> 00:12:53.743
command of God Almighty,

00:12:54.076 --> 00:12:57.993
and so they are, we can say they’re innocent,

00:12:58.452 --> 00:13:03.576
because they have no free will to do what they like.

00:13:03.993 --> 00:13:08.784
So then if you see the animals also,

00:13:09.118 --> 00:13:13.826
they also are innocent, except for very few.

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:17.410
Most of them are innocent, innocent in the sense that

00:13:17.826 --> 00:13:21.968
they are called as “pashu”– means they are completely

00:13:21.993 --> 00:13:25.410
under the control, pasha, of God Almighty.

00:13:25.659 --> 00:13:29.545
A tiger will behave like a tiger,

00:13:29.659 --> 00:13:32.076
and a snake will behave like a snake.

00:13:32.452 --> 00:13:36.551
But in human beings somebody will behave like a tiger,

00:13:36.576 --> 00:13:40.534
tomorrow like a snake and third day like a worm.

00:13:40.910 --> 00:13:42.910
There’s no steadiness.

00:13:43.285 --> 00:13:46.243
For this you cannot say that this gentleman is today tiger,

00:13:46.493 --> 00:13:48.659
so tomorrow he will not be a snake.

00:13:49.035 --> 00:13:54.618
They have no free will to change their individuality.

00:13:55.410 --> 00:13:57.452
They are left alone.

00:13:57.868 --> 00:14:01.202
So that is not the job of the Shakti to bother.

00:14:01.493 --> 00:14:04.112
That’s already been created, they are there,

00:14:04.202 --> 00:14:07.076
and they are existing.

00:14:07.743 --> 00:14:10.784
They have a purpose, that’s why they are there;

00:14:11.202 --> 00:14:15.202
and the purpose is only one, is to support human beings,

00:14:15.534 --> 00:14:18.492
because you are at the epitome of evolution.

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:24.497
So She has created all these things just for you

00:14:24.534 --> 00:14:30.951
to be created, and ultimately to get your Self-realization;

00:14:31.285 --> 00:14:33.160
to have meaning for your life,

00:14:33.185 --> 00:14:35.285
to get connected to this all-pervading Power,

00:14:35.701 --> 00:14:38.743
to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.743
All is Her work.

00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:45.327
So we can say nine times She came, and the tenth time

00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:49.452
She is supposed to give Realization to all of you.

00:14:50.243 --> 00:14:54.618
But at the tenth time, all these three powers are

00:14:54.643 --> 00:14:57.618
joined together – that’s why it’s called Trigunatmika.

00:14:57.697 --> 00:15:00.035
That’s why Buddha has said “Matreya”–

00:15:00.059 --> 00:15:04.202
means three Mothers put together.

00:15:04.743 --> 00:15:10.385
So this Power when it starts acting, it has the complete

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:17.492
control over all your three channels and seven centers –

00:15:17.868 --> 00:15:19.910
complete control,

00:15:20.534 --> 00:15:26.260
as if without the permission or without the taking

00:15:26.285 --> 00:15:32.492
the name of this Power, you cannot achieve anything.

00:15:34.202 --> 00:15:35.910
Is a fact,

00:15:36.285 --> 00:15:39.160
and that is where human beings fail,

00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:41.327
because they have a free will,

00:15:41.618 --> 00:15:45.260
and they don’t know why to obey anyone or why to listen

00:15:45.285 --> 00:15:48.618
to anyone, and why to accept anyone.

00:15:49.202 --> 00:15:54.452
That’s why, though you have to be given Self-realization,

00:15:54.743 --> 00:15:56.868
the task is very difficult;

00:15:57.784 --> 00:16:01.492
because you are not used to

00:16:02.035 --> 00:16:05.492
a way where you don’t have to use your free will.

00:16:06.452 --> 00:16:08.634
Specially in the Western countries,

00:16:08.659 --> 00:16:12.993
people have choices even for their cereals.

00:16:13.243 --> 00:16:19.410
I was told that in America there are 126 types of cereals.

00:16:20.243 --> 00:16:22.951
This kind of nonsense if you are doing,

00:16:23.202 --> 00:16:28.467
your ego definitely bloats out, and you think

00:16:28.492 --> 00:16:33.951
that “We have a right to decide for ourself.”

00:16:34.327 --> 00:16:37.759
And you cannot accept somebody who can tell you that

00:16:37.784 --> 00:16:40.534
this is not right, and this is not right.

00:16:40.951 --> 00:16:49.035
So the same Power has now been awakened in

00:16:49.207 --> 00:16:51.274
the Paramachaitanya.

00:16:51.477 --> 00:16:55.260
Now, this awakening into the Paramachaitanya is doing

00:16:55.285 --> 00:16:59.285
marvellous work, which you can see clearly.

00:16:59.561 --> 00:17:03.368
Firstly, you have seen My photographs.

00:17:03.951 --> 00:17:06.177
You see My photographs, you are stunned,

00:17:06.202 --> 00:17:09.035
you are surprised. I mean,

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:12.587
I Myself don’t know what is this Paramachaitanya

00:17:12.618 --> 00:17:14.285
is busy with.

00:17:14.368 --> 00:17:18.843
It is so activated that all the time it is working out

00:17:18.868 --> 00:17:24.868
to convince you people about the truth.

00:17:25.202 --> 00:17:28.743
If it was so active at the time of Christ,

00:17:28.993 --> 00:17:31.035
would have been much better.

00:17:31.035 --> 00:17:34.010
But it had to be this way, because human beings are

00:17:34.035 --> 00:17:38.076
the most difficult things to manage.

00:17:38.410 --> 00:17:42.177
They have been given freedom; that too,

00:17:42.202 --> 00:17:43.492
you’d be amazed,

00:17:43.826 --> 00:17:47.618
that the freedom was given to Adam and Eve,

00:17:47.868 --> 00:17:49.202
but how it was achieved,

00:17:49.202 --> 00:17:50.826
we should understand this.

00:17:51.075 --> 00:17:53.801
In the Gnostics Bible it has come out what I’ve been

00:17:53.826 --> 00:18:01.213
saying, that Adam and Eve, both of them

00:18:01.618 --> 00:18:06.993
were like pashus, under the complete control of God –

00:18:07.327 --> 00:18:08.701
no free will.

00:18:09.035 --> 00:18:15.492
They would have lived in the nude in the garden of Eden,

00:18:15.784 --> 00:18:20.801
would not have even thought of knowing anything

00:18:20.826 --> 00:18:24.826
more than that, but to eat, live like animals.

00:18:25.076 --> 00:18:27.576
They were just like animals.

00:18:27.868 --> 00:18:33.118
Then it is the Shakti itself took the form of a snake,

00:18:33.493 --> 00:18:35.050
and went and told them that

00:18:35.076 --> 00:18:38.118
“You must have the fruit of Knowledge.”

00:18:38.493 --> 00:18:40.784
She wanted to evolve.

00:18:40.784 --> 00:18:44.202
That was not the idea of God Almighty,

00:18:44.493 --> 00:18:46.202
because it’s quite a headache, you know,

00:18:46.452 --> 00:18:48.993
to do such a thing.

00:18:48.993 --> 00:18:51.260
He thought, “What is the need to have

00:18:51.285 --> 00:18:53.784
such headaches around Me?”

00:18:54.285 --> 00:18:57.368
But Shakti knew Her own style.

00:18:57.576 --> 00:19:02.944
She knew that She is capable of lots of miracles,

00:19:03.035 --> 00:19:07.013
and She can make these human beings understand

00:19:07.076 --> 00:19:10.468
the Knowledge, and She can really make them

00:19:10.493 --> 00:19:13.327
knowledgeable.

00:19:13.522 --> 00:19:15.868
So She said, “You must eat this fruit,

00:19:16.036 --> 00:19:23.368
and you must try to know the Knowledge.”

00:19:24.492 --> 00:19:30.701
So a new type of human race started,

00:19:31.368 --> 00:19:36.160
which wanted to know what is the Knowledge.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:39.801
You have seen that we had all kinds

00:19:39.826 --> 00:19:42.410
of primitive people before.

00:19:42.743 --> 00:19:45.826
Then they started evolving, evolving.

00:19:46.202 --> 00:19:50.461
Now, I have to say that

00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:57.286
the first creation which took place before that,

00:19:57.910 --> 00:20:01.576
there were other higher creations

00:20:02.119 --> 00:20:11.327
which were planned by Adi Shakti

00:20:11.371 --> 00:20:15.576
to plan out the whole thing.

00:20:15.738 --> 00:20:18.576
So She created Brahma, Vishnu, Mahesha,

00:20:18.910 --> 00:20:25.468
and She created their lokas, their atmospheres or you can

00:20:25.493 --> 00:20:28.434
say their areas.

00:20:28.514 --> 00:20:30.826
In that all the planning was done,

00:20:30.954 --> 00:20:35.817
how we can achieve this to make these animals realized

00:20:35.868 --> 00:20:38.826
souls, from animal to human beings,

00:20:38.998 --> 00:20:42.493
and from human beings to realized souls.

00:20:42.868 --> 00:20:45.493
It was a very big problem.

00:20:45.784 --> 00:20:49.759
That’s how they created, you see – as you know that

00:20:49.784 --> 00:20:51.368
Vishnu had His own loka,

00:20:51.576 --> 00:20:53.118
Mahesha had His own loka,

00:20:53.368 --> 00:20:55.993
and Brahmadeva had His own loka.

00:20:56.243 --> 00:21:00.285
And they decided among themselves how best we can do it.

00:21:00.285 --> 00:21:03.784
Because these three channels were created in human

00:21:04.035 --> 00:21:05.951
beings later on.

00:21:05.951 --> 00:21:10.467
Out of the three channels came out these three Shaktis:

00:21:10.492 --> 00:21:12.452
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

00:21:12.743 --> 00:21:16.135
They produced two children,

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:18.632
one shakti and one the brother,

00:21:18.701 --> 00:21:21.259
and then intermarriage and all that took place,

00:21:21.284 --> 00:21:25.118
in a way – marriage not in the human way,

00:21:25.274 --> 00:21:28.452
not in the human way we should say, but they were,

00:21:28.790 --> 00:21:34.160
the energy was given to the potential man.

00:21:34.534 --> 00:21:38.218
So the woman, who was the energy representing,

00:21:38.243 --> 00:21:40.701
was given to a man.

00:21:42.618 --> 00:21:44.493
All these things happened,

00:21:44.952 --> 00:21:51.327
and they chose to work it out in human beings.

00:21:51.784 --> 00:21:55.701
It happened like this, that the first working

00:21:56.118 --> 00:22:00.410
somehow or other was very effective in India.

00:22:00.826 --> 00:22:03.576
Or maybe they chose India because Indian climate

00:22:04.035 --> 00:22:05.076
is so good.

00:22:05.125 --> 00:22:07.327
I mean, you know definitely there are six seasons.

00:22:07.327 --> 00:22:09.010
It’s not like this anytime,

00:22:09.035 --> 00:22:13.159
like this irrational rain comes in, like London

00:22:13.285 --> 00:22:14.492
you have to play football also with

00:22:14.492 --> 00:22:17.076
an umbrella on your head!

00:22:18.429 --> 00:22:22.452
So there are exactly six seasons in India,

00:22:22.743 --> 00:22:24.826
and they are so well balanced.

00:22:25.202 --> 00:22:31.452
That’s why this Paramachaitanya is also called as

00:22:31.452 --> 00:22:35.382
“Ritambhara pragya” in India – not here,

00:22:35.407 --> 00:22:36.685
we cannot say.

00:22:36.710 --> 00:22:39.312
“Ritambhara pragya” means the one

00:22:39.410 --> 00:22:42.618
which is the Knowledge, pragya,

00:22:42.993 --> 00:22:47.243
means the one enlightened Knowledge,

00:22:47.336 --> 00:22:50.993
of the one which makes seasons.

00:22:51.618 --> 00:22:56.160
Because here ritambhara pragya is in a doldrum.

00:22:56.493 --> 00:22:58.576
It’s not at all understanding,

00:22:59.035 --> 00:23:01.327
because of the human beings as they are.

00:23:01.743 --> 00:23:05.918
They are so much scatterbrain, I should say,

00:23:06.118 --> 00:23:09.410
that even the nature has become scatterbrain here,

00:23:09.743 --> 00:23:12.427
and cannot understand how to deal with such human

00:23:12.452 --> 00:23:14.243
beings – is a fact.

00:23:14.270 --> 00:23:17.368
But in India it is the six seasons are there,

00:23:17.743 --> 00:23:21.492
and these six seasons are absolutely known.

00:23:23.243 --> 00:23:27.951
One has not studied the astrology of India,

00:23:28.285 --> 00:23:30.544
but they have their own astrology –

00:23:30.569 --> 00:23:32.618
of course, I don’t believe in it.

00:23:33.035 --> 00:23:37.576
But the, at the level of a human level

00:23:37.910 --> 00:23:40.160
you can see how they depict

00:23:40.576 --> 00:23:44.261
and how they can exactly say when it will rain,

00:23:44.340 --> 00:23:47.743
when it will not rain; what will happen, that will happen.

00:23:48.285 --> 00:23:51.160
Even about the stars, that such a star will be coming.

00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:54.060
Now this has been done in thousands of years back.

00:23:54.118 --> 00:23:55.327
They will exactly say

00:23:55.327 --> 00:23:57.718
what time which star will be coming nearer,

00:23:57.743 --> 00:23:59.939
what star are today governing,

00:24:00.042 --> 00:24:01.826
tomorrow what will be the star there.

00:24:02.273 --> 00:24:06.659
In those olden days they had studied all these things.

00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:10.385
When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation

00:24:10.410 --> 00:24:13.160
at that time in these Western countries,

00:24:13.618 --> 00:24:16.583
whether there were human beings or not I don’t know;

00:24:16.638 --> 00:24:23.118
but historically I think it was not such a developed place.

00:24:24.327 --> 00:24:29.868
So then all this arrangement was made,

00:24:29.868 --> 00:24:35.010
and human beings were made to understand

00:24:35.035 --> 00:24:38.576
that there is God.

00:24:39.951 --> 00:24:44.160
The saints were respected – I’m telling you in India –

00:24:44.493 --> 00:24:46.327
real saints were respected,

00:24:46.569 --> 00:24:51.285
and they made different observations.

00:24:51.618 --> 00:24:55.285
Now when I read say, Adi Shankaracharya,

00:24:55.659 --> 00:24:59.410
I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me.

00:24:59.784 --> 00:25:02.885
He knows how My knee looks like,

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:06.465
he knows how many lines I have on My back,

00:25:06.534 --> 00:25:09.710
how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man

00:25:09.735 --> 00:25:12.612
knows everything about Me.

00:25:12.843 --> 00:25:15.958
That means through his meditative power he could

00:25:15.983 --> 00:25:18.285
envisage Me – he never saw Me.

00:25:18.701 --> 00:25:22.076
The description and everything is so clear-cut.

00:25:22.492 --> 00:25:26.035
Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess,

00:25:26.492 --> 00:25:31.076
thousand names of the Goddess are so precise.

00:25:31.410 --> 00:25:34.743
I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that.

00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:38.243
Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me

00:25:38.346 --> 00:25:41.076
is there, is a fact.

00:25:41.461 --> 00:25:45.009
And it is the Knowledge of these people

00:25:45.034 --> 00:25:48.885
is most remarkable: how did they know that

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:51.492
a Goddess is like that?

00:25:51.517 --> 00:25:54.826
Certain of My things which I also don’t know,

00:25:54.826 --> 00:25:59.534
but they are there, and they have described.

00:26:00.202 --> 00:26:01.659
It’s very surprising.

00:26:02.118 --> 00:26:04.659
So their meditative power in India was great.

00:26:05.035 --> 00:26:09.993
The reason was, our seasons were disciplined,

00:26:10.452 --> 00:26:12.784
people are disciplined.

00:26:13.243 --> 00:26:15.716
In India most of the people get up early in the morning,

00:26:15.741 --> 00:26:18.118
do their pujas, everything, take their baths,

00:26:18.576 --> 00:26:23.343
and they go for work, come home, be with the family, have

00:26:23.368 --> 00:26:27.864
their food, and then sing some songs and bhajans,

00:26:28.035 --> 00:26:31.701
and then sleep off – normally.

00:26:32.327 --> 00:26:34.076
Very disciplined.

00:26:34.410 --> 00:26:36.492
They don’t go on holidays,

00:26:36.826 --> 00:26:39.410
they don’t get into drinking and things like that.

00:26:39.701 --> 00:26:43.150
Normally in the family, no question, if somebody drinks

00:26:43.175 --> 00:26:45.264
he’s thrown out of the house.

00:26:45.447 --> 00:26:48.826
He’s condemned as a leper.

00:26:49.202 --> 00:26:53.118
He’s called as a daruda, means he is a drunkard.

00:26:54.118 --> 00:26:56.993
And even nowadays some people are drinking,

00:26:57.344 --> 00:27:02.407
but they too, they hide their drinking.

00:27:02.534 --> 00:27:04.993
Nobody drinks in the presence of others.

00:27:05.492 --> 00:27:08.801
I mean, I don’t know, their influence might increase

00:27:08.826 --> 00:27:11.160
and people will start openly drinking,

00:27:11.493 --> 00:27:14.492
but normally they don’t.

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:18.885
So because of these six seasons being absolutely in

00:27:18.910 --> 00:27:24.868
discipline, we knew what to do when, and how to do it.

00:27:25.285 --> 00:27:29.951
Now, people could live in the jungles.

00:27:30.327 --> 00:27:32.951
Like in England, if you have to go out it takes fifteen,

00:27:33.202 --> 00:27:36.552
twenty minutes: you have to wear your shoes, socks,

00:27:36.577 --> 00:27:39.492
your coat, your under- this thing, that thing;

00:27:39.523 --> 00:27:42.534
otherwise you can’t get out.

00:27:42.604 --> 00:27:45.260
And you start from one place; reaching another place

00:27:45.285 --> 00:27:48.218
you’ll find it is raining heavily, you have nothing,

00:27:48.243 --> 00:27:50.368
you get drenched.

00:27:50.951 --> 00:27:53.826
But this is not so in India.

00:27:53.851 --> 00:27:57.177
It’s so balanced that when you come, all of you come

00:27:57.202 --> 00:27:59.327
in winter-time, you have seen it.

00:27:59.366 --> 00:28:02.576
It doesn’t rain suddenly, it doesn’t happen like that

00:28:02.868 --> 00:28:04.493
at a wrong time.

00:28:04.539 --> 00:28:07.618
You can stay outside as long as you want.

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.784
So these people could live in the jungles,

00:28:11.076 --> 00:28:15.534
in the sense we didn’t have so much idea of comfort at all.

00:28:15.534 --> 00:28:18.910
In a simple little hut they could live:

00:28:19.285 --> 00:28:20.951
a little protection from the sun,

00:28:21.368 --> 00:28:25.285
and protection from the rain for rainy season,

00:28:25.576 --> 00:28:26.868
that’s all.

00:28:28.072 --> 00:28:31.576
And they had very little needs of life.

00:28:32.243 --> 00:28:34.051
And we didn’t use plastics – I mean,

00:28:34.076 --> 00:28:36.285
there were no plastics that time, or even now

00:28:36.493 --> 00:28:39.263
we don’t use plastics.

00:28:39.327 --> 00:28:43.801
And we used to have few thalis and things.

00:28:43.826 --> 00:28:46.993
In a small family also they’ll have just thalis,

00:28:47.327 --> 00:28:51.659
which were just permanently with the family.

00:28:52.076 --> 00:28:55.452
Now I find that such a difference there is.

00:28:55.452 --> 00:28:59.028
You see, in simple living what happens,

00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:04.410
that you do not take out

00:29:04.701 --> 00:29:06.951
all the wealth from the Mother Earth.

00:29:07.327 --> 00:29:09.452
There’s no ecological problem there.

00:29:09.818 --> 00:29:14.218
But by having as you are saying so many glasses for this,

00:29:14.243 --> 00:29:17.177
so many glasses for that, all this kind of thing that you

00:29:17.202 --> 00:29:23.243
produce has no aesthetic value, and has no durability.

00:29:23.576 --> 00:29:26.843
So then you have mountains and mountains of these huge

00:29:26.868 --> 00:29:30.260
big plastics which cannot be burnt, which cannot be

00:29:30.285 --> 00:29:34.659
thrown away, if you throw away in the sea it floats,

00:29:35.035 --> 00:29:37.701
and such problems are there.

00:29:37.854 --> 00:29:42.175
So this Shakti that was working in those days

00:29:42.202 --> 00:29:47.534
was in them to make them seekers;

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:50.951
because they didn’t have to do anything else, you know.

00:29:50.951 --> 00:29:53.467
It’s all right, you have food to eat,

00:29:53.492 --> 00:29:54.743
you have place to sleep,

00:29:54.743 --> 00:29:58.368
finished – not much to be done,

00:29:58.659 --> 00:30:00.993
living so happily.

00:30:01.368 --> 00:30:04.596
With all these

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.076
comforts in the way that so little a demand on your time,

00:30:10.492 --> 00:30:13.049
they had time, lot of time.

00:30:13.144 --> 00:30:17.618
And with that time, what did they do?

00:30:17.733 --> 00:30:22.707
They didn’t go, say, for that, for a swimming or

00:30:22.826 --> 00:30:26.076
ballroom dancing, or nothing of the kind.

00:30:26.298 --> 00:30:29.452
With that time they meditated.

00:30:29.784 --> 00:30:32.492
And when that time meditation started,

00:30:32.693 --> 00:30:38.243
then they started realizing what is the divine Power,

00:30:38.366 --> 00:30:41.701
what is Divinity, what is God.

00:30:42.243 --> 00:30:45.035
For example I’ll tell you, here people discuss even

00:30:45.158 --> 00:30:49.074
the private life of Christ, and say all kinds of things;

00:30:49.202 --> 00:30:52.285
I mean, it’s impossible in India, nobody does that.

00:30:52.618 --> 00:30:55.618
It never comes to their head that

00:30:56.035 --> 00:30:58.327
how Krishna had sixteen thousand wives –

00:30:58.534 --> 00:31:01.302
must be some reason, He is God after all. God is God,

00:31:01.327 --> 00:31:05.091
youare a human being – how can you know about God,

00:31:05.118 --> 00:31:06.951
because you have come through Him?

00:31:07.037 --> 00:31:09.327
They don’t discuss such nonsensical things,

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:10.368
must be that.

00:31:10.444 --> 00:31:13.035
And now when I told them these are His powers,

00:31:13.060 --> 00:31:14.768
sixteen thousand, they said, “Yes.”

00:31:14.993 --> 00:31:18.118
Then, the five wives were the five elements – “Yes.”

00:31:18.452 --> 00:31:20.659
They are God.

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.492
Nobody discusses these things.

00:31:22.492 --> 00:31:25.160
God is – how can you understand God?

00:31:25.410 --> 00:31:27.826
Can you understand Me? You can’t.

00:31:28.076 --> 00:31:31.410
Try – you can’t understand Me.

00:31:31.410 --> 00:31:33.492
Very difficult.

00:31:33.564 --> 00:31:36.160
So you can’t understand,

00:31:36.576 --> 00:31:37.993
you can’t understand God.

00:31:38.452 --> 00:31:39.951
Please understand one thing,

00:31:40.034 --> 00:31:43.410
that for to understand God is an impossibility.

00:31:43.518 --> 00:31:45.452
But you can be in connection with God,

00:31:45.993 --> 00:31:47.534
you can be in the company of God,

00:31:47.658 --> 00:31:49.492
you can be blessed by God,

00:31:49.993 --> 00:31:51.694
you can be looked after by God,

00:31:51.719 --> 00:31:54.659
you can know lots of things about God;

00:31:54.764 --> 00:31:59.035
but you cannot understand.

00:32:00.285 --> 00:32:04.218
This is another thing one has to know,

00:32:04.243 --> 00:32:08.177
that you cannot understand why God does these things,

00:32:08.202 --> 00:32:10.701
why He does this, why He does that.

00:32:11.035 --> 00:32:13.743
You cannot understand, you cannot explain it.

00:32:13.951 --> 00:32:15.826
I mean, somebody can even say here,

00:32:15.826 --> 00:32:17.826
“Why did He make swastika?”

00:32:17.969 --> 00:32:19.743
Then, “Why did He make Omkara?”

00:32:19.904 --> 00:32:22.843
I mean here the people are so arrogant that they can even

00:32:22.868 --> 00:32:26.868
ask God, “Why did You exist?”

00:32:27.031 --> 00:32:28.743
They can go to that limit, you know,

00:32:29.059 --> 00:32:32.659
there’s nothing surprising.

00:32:33.035 --> 00:32:36.659
So this arrogance, this ego has blinded us from God.

00:32:36.844 --> 00:32:39.218
We think no end of ourselves,

00:32:39.243 --> 00:32:40.951
we are very self-opinionated,

00:32:40.976 --> 00:32:43.951
and we do not know much about it.

00:32:44.275 --> 00:32:49.551
So this Power, this Shakti is the one which has given you

00:32:49.576 --> 00:32:52.233
Self-realization, will also give you God-realization;

00:32:52.273 --> 00:32:54.452
but still you will not understand God.

00:32:54.501 --> 00:32:58.410
You have to go above God to understand Him.

00:32:59.743 --> 00:33:01.452
How will you understand?

00:33:01.452 --> 00:33:03.160
Supposing there’s something below you,

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.493
you can understand;

00:33:04.784 --> 00:33:06.759
but something above you, how will you understand?

00:33:06.784 --> 00:33:09.892
Supposing somebody is down below in Cabella

00:33:09.951 --> 00:33:12.051
and wants to understand about My house,

00:33:12.076 --> 00:33:14.573
will he understand?

00:33:14.598 --> 00:33:20.534
He has to go above the Cabella to see My house.

00:33:21.243 --> 00:33:24.070
So the Source from which we have come,

00:33:24.202 --> 00:33:26.452
we cannot understand that.

00:33:26.784 --> 00:33:29.343
We cannot judge, we cannot say why;

00:33:29.368 --> 00:33:35.676
that is God’s wish, God’s desire, whatever He does.

00:33:35.701 --> 00:33:37.576
So what we have to say: whatever His wish,

00:33:37.993 --> 00:33:40.784
we’ll be happy with that.

00:33:41.169 --> 00:33:44.410
And the power that is within you is Amba,

00:33:44.708 --> 00:33:47.368
is the desire power of God itself.

00:33:47.601 --> 00:33:49.885
So whatever your wish is, means that

00:33:49.910 --> 00:33:54.701
His wish is that you should enter into His Kingdom.

00:33:54.964 --> 00:33:57.868
Now you enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:33:58.181 --> 00:34:00.659
Then the Shakti makes you

00:34:00.866 --> 00:34:06.076
sit on different beautiful positions,

00:34:07.618 --> 00:34:10.509
and some are sitting in the Heart of God,

00:34:10.534 --> 00:34:13.492
some are sitting in the Sahasrara of God,

00:34:13.517 --> 00:34:16.576
in the Kingdom of God.

00:34:16.831 --> 00:34:19.910
Now you should assume your power.

00:34:20.111 --> 00:34:23.343
On Navaratri now, you should understand that it has now

00:34:23.368 --> 00:34:28.202
crossed the limit and now we are on the tenth position,

00:34:28.492 --> 00:34:29.743
where you must assume.

00:34:29.768 --> 00:34:32.035
I have told you many a times, now believe that

00:34:32.035 --> 00:34:34.285
you are Sahaja yogis.

00:34:34.285 --> 00:34:37.452
Believe that you are,

00:34:37.701 --> 00:34:40.410
you have entered into the Kingdom of God.

00:34:40.743 --> 00:34:43.327
You cannot judge God, you cannot say why She does that,

00:34:43.327 --> 00:34:45.759
why She does that, why He does that.

00:34:45.784 --> 00:34:48.492
You cannot say that – that’s different.

00:34:48.784 --> 00:34:53.118
But when you sit there, then it is not an assembly,

00:34:53.452 --> 00:34:56.914
it is not like a politician fighting, no;

00:34:57.065 --> 00:35:00.644
it is that you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:35:00.784 --> 00:35:05.160
blessed by God, looked after, protected, nourished,

00:35:05.291 --> 00:35:09.035
and made knowledgeable.

00:35:09.410 --> 00:35:12.618
But still this arrogance has to go down,

00:35:12.868 --> 00:35:16.618
that we can understand why it happens.

00:35:16.984 --> 00:35:20.708
That humility is very important for us;

00:35:20.756 --> 00:35:24.659
otherwise this power cannot take you beyond.

00:35:25.014 --> 00:35:27.784
Now as it is, it has crossed the Sahasrara,

00:35:27.968 --> 00:35:31.452
now this power has to go higher and higher.

00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:36.492
For that, first you should be humble.

00:35:36.910 --> 00:35:39.551
“Humble” doesn’t mean that it should be something

00:35:39.576 --> 00:35:44.243
artificial humility of a businessman, or a politician.

00:35:44.618 --> 00:35:48.202
It is a humbleness is within your heart,

00:35:48.701 --> 00:35:52.718
that “Oh God, we don’t want to understand You,

00:35:52.743 --> 00:35:54.951
You are too great.

00:35:55.327 --> 00:36:00.327
But let us know ourselves.”

00:36:00.627 --> 00:36:03.368
And then you’ll be amazed that He has made you

00:36:03.575 --> 00:36:06.118
like His own image.

00:36:06.170 --> 00:36:09.659
That means He has given you all the powers.

00:36:09.923 --> 00:36:11.327
He has made you.

00:36:11.701 --> 00:36:16.160
When He has made you, you cannot make Him.

00:36:16.185 --> 00:36:19.285
He is the Source, you cannot make Him.

00:36:19.783 --> 00:36:22.826
He has made you in His own image.

00:36:23.202 --> 00:36:29.327
Now, what you can do is to make others in His image.

00:36:29.743 --> 00:36:31.868
These powers are with you.

00:36:31.912 --> 00:36:33.877
But the first thing you have to have,

00:36:34.076 --> 00:36:35.910
the discipline within yourself,

00:36:36.115 --> 00:36:37.826
that is missing.

00:36:38.285 --> 00:36:40.177
People cannot discipline themselves – means

00:36:40.202 --> 00:36:41.951
if they cannot control themselves,

00:36:42.285 --> 00:36:45.618
how can they control anyone?

00:36:47.659 --> 00:36:51.202
No discipline means you cannot control yourself.

00:36:51.659 --> 00:36:53.368
So the discipline should be that first

00:36:53.784 --> 00:36:56.492
you must see that you control yourself,

00:36:56.910 --> 00:37:01.035
because now you are in the Kingdom of God.

00:37:01.492 --> 00:37:04.576
Have you seen a film called “Mr. Bean”

00:37:04.910 --> 00:37:08.285
where they show a stupid man, you see?

00:37:08.866 --> 00:37:13.368
So what happens that when you are now come to the court

00:37:13.826 --> 00:37:15.229
of the Goddess,

00:37:15.293 --> 00:37:17.914
when you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.576
you are made to sit on your throne in a dignified way.

00:37:21.993 --> 00:37:25.826
But you start behaving like Mr. Bean, you see.

00:37:25.899 --> 00:37:28.828
You don’t know how to sit on your seat,

00:37:28.853 --> 00:37:31.243
you want to sit on the sides,

00:37:31.378 --> 00:37:35.202
you want to sit on the wall or do all kinds of things.

00:37:35.452 --> 00:37:37.118
There’s no discipline.

00:37:37.335 --> 00:37:39.243
You have to have the discipline.

00:37:39.366 --> 00:37:40.660
Where are you sitting?

00:37:40.715 --> 00:37:43.576
You are sitting in the Kingdom of God.

00:37:43.915 --> 00:37:45.578
So you should have that dignity,

00:37:45.721 --> 00:37:47.492
you should have that affection,

00:37:47.675 --> 00:37:49.492
you should have that compassion,

00:37:49.517 --> 00:37:54.160
you must have that love, and the dedication.

00:37:54.229 --> 00:37:57.035
But if it is not there, then this power is useless,

00:37:57.410 --> 00:38:00.576
because you are the vehicle of that power.

00:38:00.781 --> 00:38:04.857
Supposing I have to take water, I have to have glass

00:38:05.202 --> 00:38:07.659
which is emptied inside.

00:38:07.723 --> 00:38:09.452
If it is already full with ego,

00:38:09.868 --> 00:38:12.055
what can you put inside that?

00:38:12.080 --> 00:38:14.910
Or if it is a stone, you can’t drink water out of that,

00:38:15.327 --> 00:38:22.993
you’ll have to dig in the space for putting the water.

00:38:23.368 --> 00:38:26.123
So if you are already filled with your own ideas,

00:38:26.243 --> 00:38:32.694
with your own conveniences, with your own progress

00:38:32.743 --> 00:38:36.410
or whatever it is, only that,

00:38:36.701 --> 00:38:39.743
then you cannot rise very high.

00:38:40.202 --> 00:38:43.051
You have to surrender fully there, to say that

00:38:43.076 --> 00:38:46.659
“Mother, whatever is Your desire,

00:38:47.202 --> 00:38:53.035
that we do not want to have any our individual desire.”

00:38:53.534 --> 00:38:55.576
Then the desire of God will work.

00:38:55.815 --> 00:38:58.968
You want Kundalini to work for you which is the desire

00:38:58.993 --> 00:39:00.243
of God,

00:39:00.268 --> 00:39:04.118
not your desire, which is independent of your desire,

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.701
but is the one which will fulfill your

00:39:10.035 --> 00:39:12.035
complete so-called desires,

00:39:12.475 --> 00:39:14.701
without even your Knowledge.

00:39:14.832 --> 00:39:18.293
Miracles after miracles will happen, so many miracles

00:39:18.327 --> 00:39:21.170
that now we do not know how to compile the book

00:39:21.195 --> 00:39:22.618
even on miracles.

00:39:22.643 --> 00:39:25.385
But these miracles are coming to you because you are

00:39:25.410 --> 00:39:26.784
realized souls.

00:39:27.534 --> 00:39:30.869
Your attention should be all right, you must see and

00:39:30.972 --> 00:39:34.861
introspect yourself. “I am sitting in the Kingdom of God,

00:39:34.964 --> 00:39:36.659
now what is my situation?

00:39:37.118 --> 00:39:40.467
Is it worth it, am I worth it, am I behaving in the same

00:39:40.492 --> 00:39:45.659
manner, or still I don’t believe?”

00:39:46.243 --> 00:39:48.243
If you don’t believe, how can you rise?

00:39:48.618 --> 00:39:51.343
“Believe” means that you have seen something,

00:39:51.368 --> 00:39:53.202
you have known something which is tangible,

00:39:53.263 --> 00:39:55.701
you have got the experience of it.

00:39:56.076 --> 00:40:00.452
Still you are not surrendered.

00:40:00.658 --> 00:40:02.993
If you surrender to the will of God,

00:40:03.327 --> 00:40:05.743
then everything is taken charge.

00:40:06.118 --> 00:40:08.659
It will never let you down, no question;

00:40:08.786 --> 00:40:11.659
and everything, all things which look like

00:40:11.884 --> 00:40:15.823
mountains of difficulties and obstructions

00:40:15.993 --> 00:40:20.048
you will surpass, just like an aeroplane goes over it.

00:40:20.143 --> 00:40:23.576
You won’t have any problem whatsoever.

00:40:23.720 --> 00:40:27.385
So one thing today, I am very happy that this puja is done

00:40:27.410 --> 00:40:34.221
by the people from a country which is discipline

00:40:34.246 --> 00:40:38.868
is very important – that is, Switzerland.

00:40:38.893 --> 00:40:45.618
But their discipline is for bad things, not for good.

00:40:48.993 --> 00:40:52.202
For example, they have a military:

00:40:52.534 --> 00:40:55.517
who is going to go to that far-fetched place, you see,

00:40:55.542 --> 00:40:56.739
to attack?

00:40:57.272 --> 00:40:58.397
No one.

00:40:58.422 --> 00:40:59.798
Why do they have military?

00:41:00.209 --> 00:41:02.479
And compulsory military, do you know that?

00:41:02.925 --> 00:41:05.467
Because they have looted other people’s money and

00:41:05.492 --> 00:41:08.226
kept them there, like thugs.

00:41:08.353 --> 00:41:10.801
So all that money is in their banks, and they are worried

00:41:10.826 --> 00:41:14.120
that any time, you see, any person can come up and

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:21.308
demand the money, and may start using the power

00:41:21.333 --> 00:41:23.832
of destruction on us.

00:41:24.425 --> 00:41:27.380
So, because they are doing wrong, that’s why they

00:41:27.534 --> 00:41:31.748
have a military – out of fear, just out of fear.

00:41:31.803 --> 00:41:34.327
There is no need to have any military there.

00:41:34.327 --> 00:41:36.701
But everybody has to go to military

00:41:36.726 --> 00:41:39.368
and join the military,

00:41:39.701 --> 00:41:46.410
because they are thieves of the worst type.

00:41:47.285 --> 00:41:50.951
Then secondly, they have also very much slavery

00:41:50.976 --> 00:41:53.342
of the watch, which human beings have made,

00:41:53.367 --> 00:41:55.743
God has not made.

00:41:55.838 --> 00:41:58.952
So the watch is important, because they are

00:41:58.993 --> 00:42:01.534
making watches.

00:42:01.627 --> 00:42:04.868
If they are making watches and if they do not slave

00:42:05.118 --> 00:42:10.076
under the watches, who will buy their watches?

00:42:10.251 --> 00:42:12.749
They will say, “What’s the use of you all have watches,

00:42:12.852 --> 00:42:14.327
and the way you are?”

00:42:14.352 --> 00:42:16.368
So they are very disciplined.

00:42:16.498 --> 00:42:20.218
Not only, they also are, I mean extremely

00:42:20.243 --> 00:42:22.243
as they’ve shown yesterday, they’re really

00:42:22.576 --> 00:42:27.492
too much of cleanliness in them.

00:42:28.743 --> 00:42:31.408
Some of the girls who were married – I must say

00:42:31.433 --> 00:42:34.202
I’m sorry to say this, but it is a fact –

00:42:34.419 --> 00:42:36.534
were married from Switzerland,

00:42:36.619 --> 00:42:38.468
and the reports have come that

00:42:38.493 --> 00:42:40.202
“Mother, they must have been maid-servants

00:42:40.370 --> 00:42:42.118
or bar-maids.”

00:42:42.347 --> 00:42:43.910
So I said, “Why?”

00:42:44.038 --> 00:42:46.093
“If something falls down somewhere, immediately

00:42:46.118 --> 00:42:47.784
they’ll pick it up and keep there.

00:42:47.836 --> 00:42:51.010
If something even – it’s just like, like in the guests,

00:42:51.035 --> 00:42:52.863
you see the guests are sitting

00:42:52.888 --> 00:42:54.641
and they have no time to talk.

00:42:54.666 --> 00:42:56.980
There’s no question of talking to each other,

00:42:57.005 --> 00:42:57.853
there’s nothing;

00:42:57.878 --> 00:42:59.618
all the time they are worried about

00:42:59.643 --> 00:43:01.127
this thing, this is getting dirty,

00:43:01.152 --> 00:43:03.902
that is getting dirty, like maid-servants.”

00:43:04.524 --> 00:43:05.784
Can you imagine?

00:43:05.871 --> 00:43:09.285
This has also come from the same horrible disciplining

00:43:09.310 --> 00:43:10.659
that they have.

00:43:10.719 --> 00:43:15.534
This disciplining is not divine disciplining.

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:17.659
Nature is not like that.

00:43:18.035 --> 00:43:20.759
If you see the nature, see how the nature is beautiful,

00:43:20.784 --> 00:43:24.243
the – you’ll never find any smell there.

00:43:24.534 --> 00:43:26.885
Ha, but if human beings go and live there,

00:43:26.910 --> 00:43:30.892
then all smells start. But there is no smell.

00:43:30.988 --> 00:43:34.410
Nature looks after itself, it cleanses itself, it does everything.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.826
So for everything there’s a time, it must be done with

00:43:38.202 --> 00:43:39.492
a little leisure.

00:43:39.551 --> 00:43:41.843
I mean, once if you have to clean the house,

00:43:41.868 --> 00:43:43.551
so clean the house.

00:43:43.576 --> 00:43:44.968
But all the time if your attention is cleaning this,

00:43:44.993 --> 00:43:47.659
cleaning this, make this clean, put this right –

00:43:47.706 --> 00:43:54.118
you are good for nothing, you are like a Hoover machine!

00:43:55.118 --> 00:43:57.183
And who can love such a woman

00:43:57.368 --> 00:44:03.243
who’s just a Hoover machine all the time?

00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:13.618
But again as the, you know the Devi has the,

00:44:13.643 --> 00:44:17.023
all the extremes, so this is one extreme.

00:44:17.202 --> 00:44:21.743
And the another extreme is that absolutely lousiest people,

00:44:22.202 --> 00:44:24.202
that in England –

00:44:24.826 --> 00:44:27.452
absolutely lousy, very lousy.

00:44:27.951 --> 00:44:30.536
They can live with all kinds of lousiness,

00:44:30.561 --> 00:44:34.743
and that is going too far.

00:44:34.819 --> 00:44:38.743
So this is in between one has to be.

00:44:39.202 --> 00:44:43.492
Cleanliness is for us, we are not for cleanliness.

00:44:43.517 --> 00:44:47.410
You are not paid for that, you are not maid-servants.

00:44:47.556 --> 00:44:49.659
So cleanliness has to be there.

00:44:49.684 --> 00:44:51.407
We like it so we’ll make it clean,

00:44:51.452 --> 00:44:52.843
but it should not be that

00:44:52.868 --> 00:44:55.743
everybody should be panicked about it;

00:44:56.243 --> 00:45:00.676
to be in a situation that you have no time to talk to

00:45:00.701 --> 00:45:04.253
anyone, to be nice to anyone, also no time even

00:45:04.278 --> 00:45:06.534
to meditate.

00:45:06.534 --> 00:45:09.093
Even meditating they will be seeing round

00:45:09.118 --> 00:45:11.243
if something is falling here, “Oh my God!”

00:45:11.659 --> 00:45:13.492
and they will go and pick up.

00:45:13.517 --> 00:45:15.963
I wouldn’t be surprised that even in the church they

00:45:15.988 --> 00:45:16.905
start doing that!

00:45:17.692 --> 00:45:21.859
There’s no discipline of meditation,

00:45:23.452 --> 00:45:27.492
discipline of meditation, of divine work,

00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:33.452
discipline of following the will of God –

00:45:33.784 --> 00:45:35.910
that’s not there.

00:45:36.492 --> 00:45:38.784
Unless and that discipline comes many,

00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.910
what you are doing is something so mundane and stupid,

00:45:43.368 --> 00:45:49.492
useless wastage of your life, have no dignity for yourself.

00:45:49.826 --> 00:45:54.410
So now as Sahaja yogis we have to have that discipline

00:45:54.868 --> 00:45:57.327
of meditation.

00:45:57.743 --> 00:46:03.093
Then the Power, this Amba, She knows you so well:

00:46:03.118 --> 00:46:04.327
She knows your past,

00:46:04.583 --> 00:46:07.368
and She knows what sort of a person you are.

00:46:07.368 --> 00:46:10.926
Once you start introspecting

00:46:10.951 --> 00:46:12.868
and seeing it within yourself,

00:46:13.243 --> 00:46:15.993
“what is wrong with me?”

00:46:16.492 --> 00:46:20.302
and to reach that state of complete equilibrium,

00:46:20.327 --> 00:46:21.701
“what have I to do?” –

00:46:21.815 --> 00:46:26.035
is to first of all, you have to meditate.

00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:31.502
There is no way out, I must tell you, there is no way.

00:46:31.527 --> 00:46:33.410
Somebody said, “Mother, I have given up eating this,

00:46:33.435 --> 00:46:36.576
I have given up eating that” – nothing.

00:46:37.076 --> 00:46:40.993
“Mother, I do this and I stand on my head” – nothing.

00:46:41.618 --> 00:46:44.806
You must meditate, and the meditation

00:46:44.868 --> 00:46:47.076
should be little bit in the morning

00:46:47.410 --> 00:46:49.243
and little bit in the evening.

00:46:49.523 --> 00:46:53.149
And don’t see your watch when you are meditating.

00:46:57.493 --> 00:47:01.160
The time has to be kept for meditation, whatever it is.

00:47:01.265 --> 00:47:03.160
It takes hardly any time.

00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.093
I mean, even I have seen women take so much time

00:47:05.118 --> 00:47:08.801
to get ready that even one tenth of that time

00:47:08.826 --> 00:47:12.035
if you can give for your meditation,

00:47:12.171 --> 00:47:14.921
you will be, you’ll not need much make-up.

00:47:15.484 --> 00:47:19.036
Your skin will improve, your hair will improve, your face

00:47:19.061 --> 00:47:21.492
will improve, everything will work out.

00:47:21.701 --> 00:47:24.718
You don’t have to use anything, don’t have to use any

00:47:24.743 --> 00:47:27.926
perfumes or anything whatsoever,

00:47:27.951 --> 00:47:30.993
your body itself will be full of perfume.

00:47:31.452 --> 00:47:32.993
Everything will be supplied.

00:47:33.410 --> 00:47:37.327
So what we have to do is to first of all see

00:47:37.534 --> 00:47:40.784
a surrender to the will of the God.

00:47:41.118 --> 00:47:44.243
For Sahaja yogis it’s very important.

00:47:44.492 --> 00:47:47.452
Once you surrender, all your problems will be solved.

00:47:47.659 --> 00:47:49.826
You surrender your problems also.

00:47:50.118 --> 00:47:52.534
“I leave it to You. God, You solve the problem.

00:47:52.910 --> 00:47:56.493
You do this.”

00:47:56.951 --> 00:48:01.051
It is such a precise, such an effective,

00:48:01.076 --> 00:48:06.826
such an efficient Power.

00:48:07.868 --> 00:48:14.202
And above all it loves you, cares for you, it forgives you.

00:48:14.534 --> 00:48:16.250
Even if you make mistakes it forgives,

00:48:16.275 --> 00:48:17.743
“All right, it will be all right.”

00:48:17.768 --> 00:48:20.968
It is wanting you all to be properly seated

00:48:20.993 --> 00:48:25.743
in your thrones, enjoying your power.

00:48:26.243 --> 00:48:30.492
So whatever is needed is done with great care.

00:48:31.035 --> 00:48:34.951
So Navaratri is now the tenth day of Navaratri,

00:48:35.294 --> 00:48:37.910
which is the most important for all of you,

00:48:38.363 --> 00:48:45.285
is where this Paramchaitanya has become active.

00:48:45.743 --> 00:48:48.968
And by its activity you should know it is become

00:48:48.993 --> 00:48:50.510
very powerful,

00:48:50.629 --> 00:48:56.848
and that now anybody who tries to be nasty with you,

00:48:57.118 --> 00:49:00.868
tries to trouble you – “I don’t have to worry at all.”

00:49:01.452 --> 00:49:03.743
It will take care of it.

00:49:04.025 --> 00:49:07.327
All wrong things you have done,

00:49:07.587 --> 00:49:09.784
all bad karmas you have done,

00:49:10.098 --> 00:49:14.410
you will be rewarded for that, no doubt.

00:49:14.826 --> 00:49:17.076
But if you are a realized soul, finished;

00:49:17.493 --> 00:49:19.202
you are not on that level.

00:49:19.202 --> 00:49:22.135
Like we can say that ordinary people

00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:24.410
can be charged with criminality,

00:49:24.784 --> 00:49:29.035
but supposing you rise to a higher status of kinghood,

00:49:29.410 --> 00:49:31.576
then nobody can charge you.

00:49:32.076 --> 00:49:33.910
You are above the law.

00:49:33.986 --> 00:49:37.160
In the same way, it has happened with you that nobody

00:49:37.493 --> 00:49:41.302
can touch you, nobody can destroy you, and

00:49:41.327 --> 00:49:44.618
nobody can hamper your progress.

00:49:44.993 --> 00:49:48.743
Only it is you who can do it.

00:49:49.243 --> 00:49:51.118
And nobody can harm Me,

00:49:51.452 --> 00:49:54.343
no rakshasa can harm Me and has never done so.

00:49:54.368 --> 00:49:58.534
But it is you who can harm Me;

00:49:58.897 --> 00:50:03.452
because in this life I have taken you into My body,

00:50:03.592 --> 00:50:07.576
and I am working it out in My body,

00:50:07.601 --> 00:50:11.087
everything, your cleansing, everything,

00:50:11.159 --> 00:50:13.618
which is a difficult task.

00:50:13.643 --> 00:50:15.576
But in the beginning only,

00:50:15.868 --> 00:50:19.135
this Power went to Adam and Eve and told them that

00:50:19.160 --> 00:50:21.160
“you must have the Knowledge.”

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:25.086
So that promise has to be fulfilled

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:26.484
and that has to be done,

00:50:26.509 --> 00:50:28.558
though it’s a very hazardous task.

00:50:28.743 --> 00:50:31.663
Specially in the West I find it is very hazardous

00:50:31.826 --> 00:50:35.327
to make people understand

00:50:35.763 --> 00:50:40.076
that they are the part and parcel of the whole;

00:50:40.337 --> 00:50:42.493
it’s a very difficult task.

00:50:42.910 --> 00:50:44.327
They talk of big, big things.

00:50:44.784 --> 00:50:46.718
I have seen people write articles nowadays

00:50:46.743 --> 00:50:48.492
that nothing is substantial,

00:50:48.517 --> 00:50:54.509
this science is so limited, it has not solved our problem.

00:50:54.534 --> 00:50:57.368
All these big, big books they are writing.

00:50:57.632 --> 00:51:00.218
But if you write to them now that we have found out

00:51:00.243 --> 00:51:02.564
something, they don’t want to see you.

00:51:02.589 --> 00:51:04.243
They don’t want to meet you.

00:51:04.710 --> 00:51:06.314
They have nothing to do with it.

00:51:06.485 --> 00:51:08.758
So I don’t know what sort of seekers they are,

00:51:08.806 --> 00:51:12.941
with such a big ego balloon in front, and they are seekers.

00:51:13.285 --> 00:51:15.251
What are they seeking?

00:51:15.276 --> 00:51:18.218
The ego, the balloon – supposing you have a big balloon

00:51:18.243 --> 00:51:20.302
and you drop in the water, what will happen,

00:51:20.327 --> 00:51:22.993
the balloon will take here and there and there and here,

00:51:23.018 --> 00:51:25.618
you have no destination.

00:51:25.769 --> 00:51:29.343
In the same way they are without any destination,

00:51:29.368 --> 00:51:31.427
saying that “we are seeking, we are doing this,

00:51:31.452 --> 00:51:36.659
we are doing that” – without any destination,

00:51:36.768 --> 00:51:37.926
without any understanding,

00:51:37.951 --> 00:51:39.593
without any meaning to their life,

00:51:39.618 --> 00:51:41.492
absolutely useless people.

00:51:41.910 --> 00:51:43.410
They are worth nothing.

00:51:43.743 --> 00:51:45.843
We have to try as much as possible

00:51:45.868 --> 00:51:47.285
how many we can save;

00:51:47.373 --> 00:51:49.118
but those who do not want to come,

00:51:49.268 --> 00:51:52.202
there’s no need,

00:51:52.327 --> 00:51:53.910
there's no need for us.

00:51:54.243 --> 00:51:57.509
They have to ask for it, they have to humble down and

00:51:57.534 --> 00:52:00.302
they have to say that “We want to come to you” –

00:52:00.327 --> 00:52:01.701
then only we’ll have.

00:52:02.062 --> 00:52:04.135
I never write any letter to anyone,

00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:05.784
“Please come to My program.”

00:52:06.243 --> 00:52:08.551
All these gurus used to write to all the actors and

00:52:08.576 --> 00:52:12.368
musicians and all that; I never write.

00:52:12.701 --> 00:52:14.801
It’s just I am advertising Myself,

00:52:14.826 --> 00:52:17.035
if you want to come you can come.

00:52:17.368 --> 00:52:20.826
This advertisement also I was not willing.

00:52:22.618 --> 00:52:26.410
So you can imagine that

00:52:26.993 --> 00:52:32.993
we have now brought to the fruitfulness of the promise

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:37.993
given long time back, that you will have the Knowledge.

00:52:38.492 --> 00:52:40.868
And you have the Knowledge.

00:52:41.172 --> 00:52:43.968
But with this Knowledge you should be identified,

00:52:43.993 --> 00:52:46.659
and you should know that you have this Knowledge,

00:52:46.693 --> 00:52:49.492
and that this Knowledge can be given to others.

00:52:49.772 --> 00:52:54.385
And we can transform this world into a beautiful world,

00:52:54.410 --> 00:52:58.493
and fulfill the vision of Adi Shakti.

00:52:59.285 --> 00:53:02.492
She created you for this purpose,

00:53:02.951 --> 00:53:05.926
brought you out from human level to the superhuman

00:53:05.951 --> 00:53:08.452
level for this purpose,

00:53:08.477 --> 00:53:11.076
and that is what you have to do it.

00:53:11.076 --> 00:53:17.509
And if you are today worshipping Me as the Jagadamba,

00:53:17.534 --> 00:53:18.784
then know that

00:53:18.809 --> 00:53:25.202
the Jagadamba itself is nothing else but Adi Shakti.

00:53:25.701 --> 00:53:31.076
And unless and until you people rise to that level

00:53:31.381 --> 00:53:34.327
of disciplining yourself in divine way –

00:53:34.352 --> 00:53:36.951
like some people are still smoking,

00:53:36.976 --> 00:53:40.302
“Oh, it’s all right, you know, we are ordinary people,

00:53:40.327 --> 00:53:42.327
we can’t do it.” All right, get out.

00:53:42.534 --> 00:53:46.492
Don’t worry about such people. They’ll be left behind,

00:53:46.868 --> 00:53:49.368
useless people, where will they go?

00:53:49.439 --> 00:53:52.118
They’ll be, I think, hanging in the limbo,

00:53:52.270 --> 00:53:56.410
because there isn’t much place now left even in the hell,

00:53:56.510 --> 00:53:58.826
so what is going to happen to them?

00:53:58.851 --> 00:54:00.551
But all this is available to you;

00:54:00.576 --> 00:54:01.885
only thing you must know

00:54:01.910 --> 00:54:05.576
how to control yourself, control your senses.

00:54:05.951 --> 00:54:09.493
In small, small things also we cannot control ourselves.

00:54:09.518 --> 00:54:12.320
If we cannot control our own horses,

00:54:12.345 --> 00:54:18.410
how can we reach that stage where we have to reach?

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:21.743
So in all these small things don’t waste your energies.

00:54:21.889 --> 00:54:26.251
Just think, you have to meditate, you have to rise,

00:54:26.323 --> 00:54:29.368
and you have to give it to others.

00:54:29.564 --> 00:54:34.410
This is very much possible if you really love yourself.

00:54:34.826 --> 00:54:37.285
If you love yourself, then you have to understand that

00:54:37.620 --> 00:54:43.467
“See my body, see my mind, everything is given to me by

00:54:43.492 --> 00:54:46.202
God. How beautiful it is.

00:54:46.227 --> 00:54:49.926
And now it’s such a beautiful one, and it will be used by

00:54:49.951 --> 00:54:54.826
God for such a great purpose.”

00:54:55.202 --> 00:54:57.493
You are molded, you are made like that

00:54:57.951 --> 00:55:01.202
up to this point; but now it is your free will,

00:55:01.290 --> 00:55:05.492
and with this free will you have to rise.

00:55:05.784 --> 00:55:08.113
With this free will you have to understand

00:55:08.176 --> 00:55:14.118
what is to be done, and how to achieve that state.

00:55:15.285 --> 00:55:25.160
It is nature’s reaction to things.

00:55:25.392 --> 00:55:28.452
Always nature reacts to human beings.

00:55:28.660 --> 00:55:32.969
Nature has no free will but God reacts,

00:55:33.076 --> 00:55:35.618
and when the reaction of the God comes in

00:55:35.770 --> 00:55:39.118
then we find all these things happening.

00:55:39.143 --> 00:55:42.492
And I wish you could listen to My tape on Vishnumaya,

00:55:42.910 --> 00:55:47.427
which is very, very well explaining why all these

00:55:47.452 --> 00:55:52.534
calamities come, why people die of these calamities.

00:55:52.798 --> 00:55:56.189
It was a very good lecture, I hope you all will listen to it,

00:55:56.277 --> 00:55:58.910
and listen to it again and again.

00:55:59.006 --> 00:56:02.701
My lectures should not be just for nice one evening,

00:56:02.726 --> 00:56:05.327
but should be something you should try to understand.

00:56:05.352 --> 00:56:08.534
Now whatever I am saying is the truth,

00:56:08.559 --> 00:56:11.593
is the absolute truth and is a subtle thing,

00:56:11.618 --> 00:56:14.243
which none of them have said so far.

00:56:14.643 --> 00:56:16.717
Because you have got your realization,

00:56:16.876 --> 00:56:21.993
because you are Sahaja yogi, I can say this to you.

00:56:22.368 --> 00:56:31.118
May God bless you.
