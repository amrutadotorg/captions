00:06.478 --> 00:15.553
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

00:16.506 --> 00:23.501
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

00:23.702 --> 00:27.226
for all the humanity.

00:27.427 --> 00:33.742
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

00:33.942 --> 00:39.029
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

00:39.230 --> 00:44.450
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

00:48.669 --> 00:52.508
When this happened

00:56.336 --> 01:02.012
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

01:02.213 --> 01:07.665
because no one would understand Me,

01:07.866 --> 01:15.383
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

01:15.583 --> 01:21.202
to say something about Sahasrara.

01:22.992 --> 01:33.041
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

01:33.242 --> 01:41.632
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

01:41.833 --> 01:47.893
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

01:49.266 --> 01:58.052
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

02:00.954 --> 02:10.363
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

02:11.207 --> 02:15.378
and unless and until there are many lights,

02:15.579 --> 02:22.455
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

02:24.203 --> 02:28.060
It is a human error, also, all the time,

02:28.313 --> 02:35.507
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

02:35.707 --> 02:40.839
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

02:41.040 --> 02:44.527
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

02:44.728 --> 02:50.339
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

02:51.228 --> 02:56.187
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

02:56.387 --> 03:02.698
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

03:02.899 --> 03:07.186
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

03:08.213 --> 03:15.213
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

03:15.414 --> 03:19.982
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

03:20.183 --> 03:27.571
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

03:27.771 --> 03:36.838
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

03:37.039 --> 03:43.207
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

03:43.407 --> 03:50.301
Human level is moving on another plane

03:50.502 --> 03:55.534
and it has to come up to a higher plane

03:55.734 --> 04:02.069
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

04:03.606 --> 04:08.558
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

04:08.825 --> 04:15.371
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

04:15.789 --> 04:19.174
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

04:19.375 --> 04:22.715
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

04:22.916 --> 04:29.100
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

04:31.609 --> 04:40.641
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

04:40.842 --> 04:48.050
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

04:48.251 --> 04:54.355
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

04:54.556 --> 04:58.662
their fondness for things may be different,

04:58.863 --> 05:04.717
but inside they are all very beautiful.

05:06.469 --> 05:12.141
And this I found out, one after another.

05:12.342 --> 05:17.256
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

05:17.457 --> 05:24.739
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

05:25.657 --> 05:29.209
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

05:29.410 --> 05:32.447
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

05:32.648 --> 05:39.713
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

05:41.540 --> 05:49.415
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

05:51.030 --> 05:57.882
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

05:58.082 --> 06:03.324
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

06:03.524 --> 06:10.969
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

06:11.169 --> 06:19.423
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

06:19.622 --> 06:24.058
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

06:24.259 --> 06:27.445
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

06:27.646 --> 06:32.386
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

06:32.631 --> 06:37.899
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

06:38.915 --> 06:46.648
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

06:47.053 --> 06:55.927
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

06:58.793 --> 07:08.155
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

07:08.354 --> 07:15.472
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

07:15.939 --> 07:25.182
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

07:25.698 --> 07:37.087
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

07:37.868 --> 07:44.725
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

07:44.925 --> 07:49.994
which gave them sense of reality,

07:50.194 --> 07:56.672
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

07:58.271 --> 08:04.555
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

08:04.755 --> 08:11.138
I didn't say that it took Me long,

08:11.337 --> 08:15.805
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

08:16.006 --> 08:19.942
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

08:20.143 --> 08:26.808
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

08:27.009 --> 08:33.607
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

08:33.808 --> 08:38.456
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

08:38.656 --> 08:41.423
but only I felt that from human level

08:41.623 --> 08:48.429
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

08:48.628 --> 08:53.759
then some of that still lingers on,

08:53.959 --> 08:59.656
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

08:59.857 --> 09:07.348
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

09:07.927 --> 09:16.792
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

09:16.992 --> 09:21.401
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

09:21.601 --> 09:28.208
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

09:28.409 --> 09:34.016
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

09:34.216 --> 09:42.702
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

09:43.849 --> 09:49.670
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

09:49.870 --> 09:56.763
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

09:59.793 --> 10:07.164
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

10:07.364 --> 10:11.880
maybe it's your own understanding.

10:12.081 --> 10:18.631
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

10:18.831 --> 10:24.735
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

10:24.936 --> 10:29.898
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

10:30.099 --> 10:34.811
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

10:35.012 --> 10:41.240
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

10:41.440 --> 10:43.757
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

10:43.957 --> 10:49.424
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

10:49.624 --> 10:59.045
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

10:59.245 --> 11:06.757
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

11:08.032 --> 11:13.783
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

11:29.793 --> 11:35.596
When you feel responsible, you must know

11:35.797 --> 11:41.706
that you are not in charge, one thing.

11:41.915 --> 11:50.829
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

11:51.218 --> 12:01.002
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

12:02.848 --> 12:07.503
So to think that you are doing anything

12:07.703 --> 12:13.019
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

12:13.217 --> 12:18.661
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

12:18.862 --> 12:23.775
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

12:24.525 --> 12:28.282
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

12:28.482 --> 12:35.079
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

12:35.474 --> 12:43.183
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

12:43.400 --> 12:49.012
this great tree of spirituality within you.

12:49.248 --> 12:58.676
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

12:58.885 --> 13:07.299
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

13:08.413 --> 13:16.771
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

13:18.909 --> 13:23.049
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

13:23.250 --> 13:29.392
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

13:29.593 --> 13:33.069
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

13:33.269 --> 13:36.305
You are testing yourself, and now must know

13:36.505 --> 13:41.591
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

13:44.366 --> 13:47.861
where very few have entered.

13:58.079 --> 14:02.311
And there in that garden, when you enter,

14:02.668 --> 14:13.365
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

14:15.163 --> 14:21.112
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

14:21.770 --> 14:29.843
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

14:30.043 --> 14:34.278
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

14:34.478 --> 14:38.466
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

14:38.667 --> 14:44.834
that friendship, without any expectation.

14:45.989 --> 14:49.305
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

14:49.505 --> 14:55.115
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

14:55.315 --> 15:00.596
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

15:01.739 --> 15:06.460
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

15:06.660 --> 15:10.868
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

15:11.068 --> 15:16.630
or he's not doing much in life.

15:25.531 --> 15:29.398
This integration, this oneness,

15:29.599 --> 15:34.145
this feeling of identification with others

15:34.346 --> 15:40.637
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

15:43.494 --> 15:49.675
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

15:50.718 --> 15:55.689
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

15:55.889 --> 16:01.277
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

16:01.477 --> 16:06.462
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

16:06.909 --> 16:11.606
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

16:11.807 --> 16:17.187
but I've seen how it happens.

16:18.731 --> 16:25.846
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

16:26.046 --> 16:31.895
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

16:33.732 --> 16:36.429
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

16:36.629 --> 16:43.463
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

16:43.664 --> 16:48.139
Here then, you become absolutely humble

16:48.541 --> 16:52.858
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

16:54.318 --> 16:58.316
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

16:58.515 --> 17:03.429
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

17:04.481 --> 17:12.438
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

17:14.145 --> 17:19.254
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

17:20.183 --> 17:27.343
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

17:27.544 --> 17:33.411
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

17:33.851 --> 17:38.961
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

17:42.033 --> 17:47.147
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

17:47.580 --> 17:51.253
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

17:53.496 --> 18:03.449
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

18:04.158 --> 18:08.878
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

18:09.079 --> 18:13.137
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

18:15.808 --> 18:19.847
Such a flexible temperament you developed

18:20.048 --> 18:24.802
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

18:25.039 --> 18:29.652
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

18:29.853 --> 18:34.502
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

18:34.701 --> 18:41.703
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

18:41.904 --> 18:49.610
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

18:51.682 --> 18:57.534
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

18:57.735 --> 19:04.054
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

19:04.255 --> 19:08.652
to do this great job, to do that.

19:14.698 --> 19:23.711
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

19:24.810 --> 19:29.354
nor you should think that you are very
small.

19:31.311 --> 19:40.022
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

19:40.222 --> 19:49.314
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

19:49.514 --> 19:53.881
It could expand into anything,

19:54.955 --> 20:00.402
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

20:01.502 --> 20:09.469
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

20:10.668 --> 20:16.768
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

20:16.968 --> 20:22.993
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

20:23.193 --> 20:28.199
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

20:28.454 --> 20:35.145
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

20:36.609 --> 20:43.582
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

20:43.783 --> 20:49.593
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

20:49.792 --> 20:57.334
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

20:58.717 --> 21:01.855
I'll give you an example.

21:02.976 --> 21:09.460
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

21:09.661 --> 21:14.763
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

21:14.963 --> 21:18.929
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

21:19.129 --> 21:25.537
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

21:25.738 --> 21:30.539
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

21:31.848 --> 21:37.689
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

21:37.890 --> 21:41.622
and she couldn't move her fingers.

21:42.143 --> 21:47.247
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

21:47.447 --> 21:52.450
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

21:52.650 --> 21:57.247
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

21:57.447 --> 22:01.734
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

22:04.371 --> 22:07.066
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

22:07.267 --> 22:10.563
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

22:10.764 --> 22:13.427
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

22:13.627 --> 22:15.700
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

22:15.901 --> 22:19.365
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

22:19.643 --> 22:24.487
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

22:24.687 --> 22:28.263
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

22:28.464 --> 22:30.203
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

22:30.404 --> 22:35.320
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

22:35.520 --> 22:40.301
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

22:43.138 --> 22:46.196
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

22:46.397 --> 22:52.203
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

22:52.404 --> 22:56.685
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

22:56.884 --> 22:59.245
if you have to do that, it will work out.

22:59.406 --> 23:03.984
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

23:04.514 --> 23:07.910
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

23:08.111 --> 23:10.892
and who is not a realized soul.

23:11.092 --> 23:16.163
A realized soul person is not bothered

23:16.364 --> 23:23.530
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

23:24.799 --> 23:27.442
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

23:27.643 --> 23:33.905
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

23:38.341 --> 23:41.526
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

23:41.726 --> 23:46.248
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

23:46.449 --> 23:50.072
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

23:50.273 --> 23:53.161
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

23:53.362 --> 23:59.290
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

23:59.603 --> 24:03.786
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

24:03.987 --> 24:06.986
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

24:07.187 --> 24:12.013
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

24:12.213 --> 24:15.861
That you can live under any circumstances

24:16.061 --> 24:22.739
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

24:24.356 --> 24:29.650
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

24:32.837 --> 24:38.773
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

24:38.974 --> 24:41.927
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

24:42.127 --> 24:44.939
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

24:45.139 --> 24:49.009
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

24:49.209 --> 24:56.597
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

24:57.164 --> 25:01.768
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

25:01.968 --> 25:07.979
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

25:08.179 --> 25:17.023
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

25:17.494 --> 25:22.683
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

25:22.883 --> 25:29.018
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

25:29.412 --> 25:36.089
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

25:36.289 --> 25:44.478
If it can, it will, and also it tries

25:44.679 --> 25:53.118
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

25:53.741 --> 25:59.337
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

25:59.538 --> 26:04.755
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

26:05.564 --> 26:11.405
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

26:11.739 --> 26:20.373
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

26:22.806 --> 26:30.843
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

26:31.044 --> 26:37.275
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

26:37.476 --> 26:41.703
this Divine power, they cannot.

26:42.655 --> 26:47.056
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

26:47.257 --> 26:54.983
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

26:55.184 --> 27:01.345
and now you are just like great citizens

27:01.545 --> 27:08.865
of the great realm of divinity.

27:09.250 --> 27:15.461
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

27:16.429 --> 27:23.807
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

27:24.373 --> 27:34.288
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

27:34.788 --> 27:43.002
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

27:43.202 --> 27:48.986
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

27:49.186 --> 27:56.904
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

27:57.436 --> 28:03.560
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

28:03.741 --> 28:08.819
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

28:09.019 --> 28:14.280
But it never means that you should give up,

28:14.480 --> 28:20.044
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

28:20.245 --> 28:28.280
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

28:28.735 --> 28:32.761
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

28:32.961 --> 28:39.958
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

28:40.158 --> 28:46.234
or I do not earnestly want anything.

28:48.215 --> 28:52.869
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

28:53.733 --> 28:59.931
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

29:00.192 --> 29:05.441
You people are very differently made.

29:05.642 --> 29:08.915
Because you have achieved something.

29:19.140 --> 29:25.797
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

29:26.745 --> 29:29.513
Because you’ve achieved something,

29:29.714 --> 29:36.537
you know how you were and what you are now.

29:39.512 --> 29:47.597
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

29:48.974 --> 29:53.602
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

29:53.803 --> 29:58.913
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

29:59.114 --> 30:04.537
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

30:04.738 --> 30:13.128
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

30:13.612 --> 30:20.071
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

30:20.271 --> 30:25.729
You have crossed the bondage and now

30:25.930 --> 30:30.266
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

30:32.095 --> 30:39.024
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

30:39.224 --> 30:48.064
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

30:48.265 --> 30:52.074
then this lotus opens like this.

30:53.229 --> 30:58.252
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

30:59.947 --> 31:05.058
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

31:05.259 --> 31:11.708
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

31:11.909 --> 31:17.944
just like these, and they look like flames.

31:18.144 --> 31:24.759
But these flames are not with any heat,

31:24.959 --> 31:30.177
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

31:30.377 --> 31:37.676
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

31:39.368 --> 31:44.712
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

31:45.093 --> 31:52.586
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

31:54.907 --> 31:57.871
This is what has happened to you.

31:59.592 --> 32:05.277
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

32:07.695 --> 32:13.082
and there where we fail, sometimes,

32:13.376 --> 32:20.342
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

32:21.469 --> 32:29.327
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

32:29.528 --> 32:33.145
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

32:33.346 --> 32:42.268
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

32:47.963 --> 32:50.901
So you have to be,

32:58.794 --> 33:01.775
you have to be on the guard,

33:03.637 --> 33:09.347
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

33:10.752 --> 33:16.136
The first is ego, which how to attack,

33:16.337 --> 33:21.451
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

33:22.055 --> 33:25.233
that's the only vehicle.

33:29.526 --> 33:35.020
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

33:35.221 --> 33:39.743
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

33:41.699 --> 33:46.941
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

33:47.830 --> 33:53.864
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

33:56.162 --> 33:58.797
Why are you angry?

33:59.837 --> 34:04.924
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

34:05.125 --> 34:08.366
or to check someone? Why?

34:08.880 --> 34:11.649
The mind will not answer.

34:14.501 --> 34:17.866
The simple thing, if you can do,

34:18.067 --> 34:23.783
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

34:24.767 --> 34:31.360
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

34:33.729 --> 34:37.217
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

34:37.417 --> 34:40.544
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

34:40.745 --> 34:46.367
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

34:48.744 --> 34:52.545
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

34:52.746 --> 34:57.450
just know that you have to love that person.

35:00.184 --> 35:04.219
Now, how will you love that person?

35:04.419 --> 35:11.812
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

35:12.013 --> 35:17.403
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

35:19.407 --> 35:24.543
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

35:25.154 --> 35:30.714
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

35:30.914 --> 35:34.617
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

35:34.818 --> 35:39.027
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

35:39.243 --> 35:44.159
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

35:44.413 --> 35:47.123
Very amusing.

35:49.818 --> 35:54.350
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

35:54.550 --> 36:01.615
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

36:01.816 --> 36:05.603
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

36:05.804 --> 36:08.607
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

36:08.775 --> 36:09.887
makes no difference.

36:10.088 --> 36:15.331
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

36:15.532 --> 36:22.407
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

36:24.308 --> 36:27.839
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

36:28.040 --> 36:33.295
and that's the only source of her life,

36:33.496 --> 36:37.622
then I can understand why she is so upset.

36:43.802 --> 36:46.667
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

36:46.868 --> 36:50.987
very easily, it's not difficult,

36:51.479 --> 36:56.112
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

36:56.635 --> 37:05.781
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

37:06.761 --> 37:10.705
then what happens, you get understanding.

37:10.936 --> 37:17.343
Understanding of that person, you realize,

37:18.755 --> 37:22.365
as if identified with that person.

37:23.242 --> 37:28.068
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

37:28.269 --> 37:33.809
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

37:34.010 --> 37:38.695
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

37:38.895 --> 37:44.095
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

37:47.857 --> 37:53.841
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

37:54.042 --> 37:57.441
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

37:57.642 --> 38:02.408
The identification with another is very
important.

38:06.980 --> 38:12.541
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

38:13.783 --> 38:19.350
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

38:20.758 --> 38:27.707
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

38:27.907 --> 38:34.902
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

38:36.509 --> 38:47.610
This ego will immediately sucked in

38:47.811 --> 38:54.420
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

38:59.451 --> 39:04.200
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

39:05.533 --> 39:14.477
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

39:15.346 --> 39:19.057
Because you are a realized soul.

39:22.410 --> 39:26.520
Also, as I said,

39:28.627 --> 39:32.697
when you are identified with another
person,

39:33.293 --> 39:38.923
you put that person in charge of divinity -

39:44.657 --> 39:50.472
just a feeling of oneness.

39:53.495 --> 40:00.410
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

40:03.326 --> 40:09.638
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

40:09.839 --> 40:17.058
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

40:17.259 --> 40:21.683
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

40:21.884 --> 40:27.689
Not a saint, saint never says that.

40:28.602 --> 40:30.463
That time, when you say that,

40:30.664 --> 40:34.227
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

40:34.428 --> 40:36.782
For example, the one, now supposing

40:36.983 --> 40:42.200
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

40:43.688 --> 40:47.441
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

40:47.642 --> 40:52.618
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

40:57.138 --> 41:01.475
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

41:02.237 --> 41:05.279
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

41:05.480 --> 41:08.440
or the gentleman who has done it,

41:09.182 --> 41:13.587
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

41:14.238 --> 41:18.797
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

41:18.998 --> 41:21.704
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

41:21.905 --> 41:26.222
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

41:30.095 --> 41:33.718
Who are you to judge anyone?

41:39.143 --> 41:47.842
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

41:48.981 --> 41:56.058
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

41:56.259 --> 42:00.198
So why waste energy on judging others?

42:04.230 --> 42:10.091
We should see what is good in others,

42:12.016 --> 42:15.755
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

42:15.956 --> 42:18.472
everything first class.

42:20.764 --> 42:28.594
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

42:30.527 --> 42:35.325
You can watch, you can witness,

42:36.166 --> 42:41.660
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

42:41.861 --> 42:45.714
something that would upset others.

42:46.716 --> 42:49.630
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

42:49.831 --> 42:55.051
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

42:55.252 --> 42:58.887
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

42:59.088 --> 43:01.734
is just bubbling through that,

43:01.935 --> 43:06.715
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

43:06.916 --> 43:11.904
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

43:12.245 --> 43:14.970
You can be in the same position.

43:15.171 --> 43:17.717
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

43:17.917 --> 43:20.952
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

43:21.152 --> 43:25.756
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

43:26.240 --> 43:31.558
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

43:31.856 --> 43:35.938
you are too great to bother about these
things.

43:36.941 --> 43:43.059
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

43:43.260 --> 43:47.601
and just making yourselves small.

43:49.835 --> 43:56.317
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

43:56.518 --> 44:04.467
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

44:05.630 --> 44:11.335
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

44:12.942 --> 44:19.315
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

44:20.100 --> 44:24.041
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

44:25.688 --> 44:29.217
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

44:32.074 --> 44:36.393
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

44:41.659 --> 44:48.863
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

44:49.064 --> 44:52.415
what love I have expressed?

44:52.829 --> 44:57.772
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

44:58.724 --> 45:05.328
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

45:05.529 --> 45:09.386
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

45:09.586 --> 45:14.974
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

45:15.175 --> 45:21.702
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

45:21.999 --> 45:25.114
But what have you done

45:28.812 --> 45:33.066
in this realm of reality?

45:33.614 --> 45:37.391
Have you enjoyed the reality?

45:38.748 --> 45:49.289
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

45:52.325 --> 46:02.612
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

46:03.858 --> 46:09.494
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

46:09.695 --> 46:15.833
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

46:16.372 --> 46:25.119
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

46:27.049 --> 46:40.812
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

46:42.265 --> 46:46.757
So ugly this world has become.

46:48.305 --> 46:51.484
Can you beautify it?

46:54.155 --> 46:58.177
You can, because you can transform people.

46:58.378 --> 47:05.849
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

47:08.107 --> 47:14.635
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

47:15.770 --> 47:22.164
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

47:23.314 --> 47:30.511
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

47:30.712 --> 47:35.861
The another side is that we are still
identified

47:36.061 --> 47:40.521
with things which we should not have been
identified.

47:42.763 --> 47:45.594
We can just find out.

47:47.844 --> 47:57.457
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

48:00.437 --> 48:10.667
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

48:12.933 --> 48:16.882
All the fools, you see,

48:17.083 --> 48:23.642
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

48:23.843 --> 48:33.765
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

48:34.805 --> 48:38.423
God knows when it is going to collide.

48:38.955 --> 48:44.933
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

48:45.134 --> 48:48.964
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

48:49.165 --> 48:52.826
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

48:53.027 --> 48:57.097
come home and again quarrel and fight.

48:59.633 --> 49:03.683
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

49:04.064 --> 49:07.424
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

49:07.625 --> 49:11.626
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

49:11.827 --> 49:16.368
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

49:16.569 --> 49:20.459
and what happens to them? Nothing.

49:20.762 --> 49:25.369
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

49:25.570 --> 49:30.965
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

49:31.695 --> 49:36.936
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

49:40.590 --> 49:46.222
I've known so many people like that.

49:50.476 --> 49:58.985
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

49:59.186 --> 50:03.229
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

50:03.430 --> 50:08.826
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

50:09.027 --> 50:12.811
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

50:13.012 --> 50:19.234
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

50:20.401 --> 50:24.854
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

50:25.054 --> 50:28.266
everybody knew he's having a bath,

50:28.467 --> 50:34.743
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

50:34.944 --> 50:40.594
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

50:41.181 --> 50:43.690
and I heard something like,

50:43.891 --> 50:47.013
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

50:47.214 --> 50:50.269
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

50:50.470 --> 50:55.278
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

50:55.479 --> 50:59.593
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

50:59.794 --> 51:05.474
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

51:05.674 --> 51:13.462
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

51:13.662 --> 51:16.348
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

51:16.549 --> 51:21.679
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

51:23.373 --> 51:27.400
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

51:27.876 --> 51:31.615
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

51:31.816 --> 51:38.828
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

51:39.029 --> 51:48.229
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

51:48.927 --> 51:52.552
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

51:52.753 --> 51:59.390
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

52:00.438 --> 52:04.282
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

52:04.483 --> 52:09.833
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

52:10.034 --> 52:15.789
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

52:15.990 --> 52:23.423
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

52:24.137 --> 52:28.470
That kills the full experience of reality.

52:30.036 --> 52:35.296
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

52:35.497 --> 52:40.211
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

52:40.412 --> 52:43.210
morning till evening.

52:44.174 --> 52:46.426
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

52:46.627 --> 52:48.907
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

52:49.108 --> 52:52.208
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

52:52.409 --> 52:55.161
But we are not brainless people.

52:55.362 --> 53:00.372
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

53:01.087 --> 53:05.025
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

53:05.226 --> 53:08.941
or which are something, we don't.

53:11.521 --> 53:22.036
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

53:23.988 --> 53:31.093
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

53:32.276 --> 53:36.396
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

53:36.597 --> 53:39.674
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

53:39.875 --> 53:46.462
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

53:46.663 --> 53:54.073
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

53:55.916 --> 54:06.727
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

54:06.928 --> 54:14.549
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

54:16.371 --> 54:21.850
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

54:22.051 --> 54:27.867
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

54:28.068 --> 54:32.899
It's absolutely a flexible personality

54:33.100 --> 54:43.809
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

54:46.884 --> 54:53.797
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

54:55.352 --> 55:02.344
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

55:02.545 --> 55:11.233
that are facing us because of stupidity.

55:13.062 --> 55:17.272
This integration I'm sure will take place,

55:19.800 --> 55:28.147
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

55:28.663 --> 55:38.400
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

55:38.804 --> 55:41.794
It's going to happen.

55:42.373 --> 55:47.196
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

55:47.397 --> 55:53.278
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

55:53.479 --> 55:59.189
to truth and reality? It will.

55:59.761 --> 56:04.765
So today, on such an important day for us,

56:04.966 --> 56:11.534
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

56:11.735 --> 56:21.534
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

56:21.735 --> 56:27.821
light of compassion, light of love

56:29.849 --> 56:38.600
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

56:39.243 --> 56:47.114
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

56:47.979 --> 56:51.515
May God bless you.
