00:00:06.478 --> 00:00:15.553
Today we are celebrating the opening
of the Sahasrara on this day.

00:00:16.506 --> 00:00:23.501
I must say it was a great happening
that took place

00:00:23.702 --> 00:00:27.226
for all the humanity.

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:33.742
It was such an achievement which I never
realized before,

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:39.029
now I can see, that without Self
Realization

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.450
it would have been impossible to talk
to people.

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:52.508
When this happened

00:00:56.336 --> 00:01:02.012
I thought that, how will I talk to people
about it,

00:01:02.213 --> 00:01:07.665
because no one would understand Me,

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:15.383
and it would be a big mistake on My part,

00:01:15.583 --> 00:01:21.202
to say something about Sahasrara.

00:01:22.992 --> 00:01:33.041
Because even about Sahasrara, nowhere
in the scriptures somethings was described.

00:01:33.242 --> 00:01:41.632
It was absolutely an ambiguous description,
I would say, where people could not

00:01:41.833 --> 00:01:47.893
have even thought that there is a realm
beyond Sahasrara.

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:58.052
And one has to enter into that realm where
is the reality.

00:02:00.954 --> 00:02:10.363
That time, what I saw around Me, I felt is
all darkness,

00:02:11.207 --> 00:02:15.378
and unless and until there are many lights,

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:22.455
people will never realize that how
important it is to have lights.

00:02:24.203 --> 00:02:28.060
It is a human error, also, all the time,

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:35.507
that if somebody achieves something,
then they put that person onto a shelf.

00:02:35.707 --> 00:02:40.839
For example, Christ - all right, He was
Christ - we are not Christ.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.527
Mohammed Sahib, He was Mohammed Sahib -
we are not Mohammed Sahib.

00:02:44.728 --> 00:02:50.339
Rama was Rama, Krishna was Krishna. We are
not that.

00:02:51.228 --> 00:02:56.187
How can you expect human beings to behave
like Them?

00:02:56.387 --> 00:03:02.698
So, absolutely they are separated,
the divine personalities -

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:07.186
away, very much away, from human
personalities.

00:03:08.213 --> 00:03:15.213
It was just a adoration, I can say, faith,

00:03:15.414 --> 00:03:19.982
but when they said, "We tried to follow
Them," they could not.

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:27.571
They could not follow Them, because I think
human movement

00:03:27.771 --> 00:03:36.838
is on parallel lines with the Divine and
these lines do not meet,

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:43.207
unless and until you give them Self
Realization.

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:50.301
Human level is moving on another plane

00:03:50.502 --> 00:03:55.534
and it has to come up to a higher plane

00:03:55.734 --> 00:04:02.069
to understand that what they know is not
reality.

00:04:03.606 --> 00:04:08.558
I wouldn't say what is needed for that,

00:04:08.825 --> 00:04:15.371
because in My own experience, all kinds
of people came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:19.174
There’re people described to be very bad,
cruel

00:04:19.375 --> 00:04:22.715
and other ones who were very licentious,
this, that -

00:04:22.916 --> 00:04:29.100
then another ones who were cheats and they
said, "Mother they are horrible people."

00:04:31.609 --> 00:04:40.641
But I've seen that every human being is
as if made of the same character,

00:04:40.842 --> 00:04:48.050
as far as the Spirit is concerned. Outside
they may be different to look at,

00:04:48.251 --> 00:04:54.355
their way of talking may be different,
their styles may be different,

00:04:54.556 --> 00:04:58.662
their fondness for things may be different,

00:04:58.863 --> 00:05:04.717
but inside they are all very beautiful.

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:12.141
And this I found out, one after another.

00:05:12.342 --> 00:05:17.256
You don't know how much it was giving Me
joy;

00:05:17.457 --> 00:05:24.739
not only joy, but also encouragement,
support and patience.

00:05:25.657 --> 00:05:29.209
And then now, you see, how Sahaja Yoga
has grown.

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.447
The greatest thing has now happened is,
which I realize,

00:05:32.648 --> 00:05:39.713
I'm very happy about it, that Sahaja Yogis
feel very responsible about Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:49.415
And they feel that they have to spread this
enlightenment everywhere.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.882
It's their innate desire now to spread
Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:58.082 --> 00:06:03.324
Firstly it was that they should become
spirits.

00:06:03.524 --> 00:06:10.969
Before that, also there were some people
who didn't actually seek the Spirit,

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:19.423
but they also became Sahaja Yogis. And I'm
surprised, with some of you,

00:06:19.622 --> 00:06:24.058
that I never expected that they would go
so far -

00:06:24.259 --> 00:06:27.445
and suddenly you hear that such and such
a person

00:06:27.646 --> 00:06:32.386
has gone there, has done this, has done
this.

00:06:32.631 --> 00:06:37.899
So, when you came into the realm of reality,

00:06:38.915 --> 00:06:46.648
I don't know which principle you accepted
first, that's your understanding.

00:06:47.053 --> 00:06:55.927
But one thing you realized that you are
definitely connected with the Divine.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:08.155
Some people had tremendous experiences,
some had mild experiences,

00:07:08.354 --> 00:07:15.472
but most of them, I saw, started believing
in themselves,

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:25.182
understanding themselves, and having
confidence about themselves.

00:07:25.698 --> 00:07:37.087
Because there are so many myths about God,
religion, gurus,

00:07:37.868 --> 00:07:44.725
that when they saw the light of the Spirit,

00:07:44.925 --> 00:07:49.994
which gave them sense of reality,

00:07:50.194 --> 00:07:56.672
they’re as if they steadied their minds,
they steadied themselves.

00:07:58.271 --> 00:08:04.555
All this happened, I must say, in a very
short time.

00:08:04.755 --> 00:08:11.138
I didn't say that it took Me long,

00:08:11.337 --> 00:08:15.805
or I had to go through lots of various
experiences.

00:08:16.006 --> 00:08:19.942
Because to Me, all these experiences are
nothing.

00:08:20.143 --> 00:08:26.808
If a ship is seaworthy, it can face all
kinds of

00:08:27.009 --> 00:08:33.607
high tides and all kinds of sharks and
everything, without any difficulty

00:08:33.808 --> 00:08:38.456
because it is seaworthy. So I didn't feel
that way,

00:08:38.656 --> 00:08:41.423
but only I felt that from human level

00:08:41.623 --> 00:08:48.429
to this spiritual level, to this Divine
level, when you are coming,

00:08:48.628 --> 00:08:53.759
then some of that still lingers on,

00:08:53.959 --> 00:08:59.656
some of that is still there. It has to be
cleansed,

00:08:59.857 --> 00:09:07.348
it has to be brightened, we should say,
or absolutely enlightened.

00:09:07.927 --> 00:09:16.792
But what was the great thing about Sahaja
Yoga, that you yourself did all that.

00:09:16.992 --> 00:09:21.401
It is nice to say, "Mother, You did this,
You did that."

00:09:21.601 --> 00:09:28.208
Maybe enlightenment part of it, but say now
there are lights here,

00:09:28.409 --> 00:09:34.016
and these lights, unless and until they are
attended to, looked after,

00:09:34.216 --> 00:09:42.702
and given oil of love, how can they go on
burning?

00:09:43.849 --> 00:09:49.670
This is something, what I must say that you
people somehow or other realized

00:09:49.870 --> 00:09:56.763
how important it was to become good Sahaja
Yogis.

00:09:59.793 --> 00:10:07.164
Maybe introspection, I don't say, maybe
somebody else talked about it,

00:10:07.364 --> 00:10:11.880
maybe it's your own understanding.

00:10:12.081 --> 00:10:18.631
Whatever it was, all of you tried to be
good Sahaja Yogis.

00:10:18.831 --> 00:10:24.735
Of course, there are people who are
sometimes very angry with Me,

00:10:24.936 --> 00:10:29.898
like, "Why don't You cure my sister, or why
don't you cure My father,

00:10:30.099 --> 00:10:34.811
if you are God?" This, that is there. But
makes no difference to Me,

00:10:35.012 --> 00:10:41.240
because they're so frustrated, so upset,
so they are talking like that.

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:43.757
If you see one or two persons here and
there,

00:10:43.957 --> 00:10:49.424
you see here thousands, such beautiful
people.

00:10:49.624 --> 00:10:59.045
It's complete emancipation of this earth,
of this globe

00:10:59.245 --> 00:11:06.757
I'm sure will take place, if you people all
take up the responsibility.

00:11:08.032 --> 00:11:13.783
The responsibility has certain problems,
which we should know.

00:11:29.793 --> 00:11:35.596
When you feel responsible, you must know

00:11:35.797 --> 00:11:41.706
that you are not in charge, one thing.

00:11:41.915 --> 00:11:50.829
Secondly, you also must know, that there
are so many other forces,

00:11:51.218 --> 00:12:01.002
so many angels and ganas are with you,
you are not alone.

00:12:02.848 --> 00:12:07.503
So to think that you are doing anything

00:12:07.703 --> 00:12:13.019
will make you, maybe, egoistical.

00:12:13.217 --> 00:12:18.661
At that time, what you have to do, is best
is to say, "All right,

00:12:18.862 --> 00:12:23.775
I'm not doing anything, is the Divine that
is working it out."

00:12:24.525 --> 00:12:28.282
Not that the Divine wants any credit from
you,

00:12:28.482 --> 00:12:35.079
but by saying that, this balloon of ego
will not come up.

00:12:35.474 --> 00:12:43.183
And you'll become humble and this humility
will definitely improve

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:49.012
this great tree of spirituality within you.

00:12:49.248 --> 00:12:58.676
Definitely it will make you a very evolved
personality,

00:12:58.885 --> 00:13:07.299
no doubt about it. But first of all, we
have to say, "I'm not doing anything".

00:13:08.413 --> 00:13:16.771
It's very important to understand, when you
have spiritual authority to do things.

00:13:18.909 --> 00:13:23.049
It is not a testing ground, I can tell you
this much. Many people think

00:13:23.250 --> 00:13:29.392
that Mother is testing us. I'm not testing
you, you are testing yourself.

00:13:29.593 --> 00:13:33.069
I'm not saying don't do this or don't do
that.

00:13:33.269 --> 00:13:36.305
You are testing yourself, and now must know

00:13:36.505 --> 00:13:41.591
that, you are in the beautiful garden
of reality,

00:13:44.366 --> 00:13:47.861
where very few have entered.

00:13:58.079 --> 00:14:02.311
And there in that garden, when you enter,

00:14:02.668 --> 00:14:13.365
what do you see? Is, everything is full
of beauty.

00:14:15.163 --> 00:14:21.112
Every person has something sweet about
himself,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:29.843
because all other Sahaja Yogis are also
having the same kind of experiences

00:14:30.043 --> 00:14:34.278
of this reality, which cannot be described
in words;

00:14:34.478 --> 00:14:38.466
but you start feeling it, that oneness,
that nearness,

00:14:38.667 --> 00:14:44.834
that friendship, without any expectation.

00:14:45.989 --> 00:14:49.305
You start feeling, "Oh, it's a Sahaja Yogi."

00:14:49.505 --> 00:14:55.115
A kind of a completely integrated organism
as you become;

00:14:55.315 --> 00:15:00.596
you become an organization I should say,
which is a living organization.

00:15:01.739 --> 00:15:06.460
In that you do not feel you are something
separate -

00:15:06.660 --> 00:15:10.868
any Sahaja Yogi, whether he is highly
placed

00:15:11.068 --> 00:15:16.630
or he's not doing much in life.

00:15:25.531 --> 00:15:29.398
This integration, this oneness,

00:15:29.599 --> 00:15:34.145
this feeling of identification with others

00:15:34.346 --> 00:15:40.637
makes you so large, so big, so great,
so powerful.

00:15:43.494 --> 00:15:49.675
You are not alone, and you say, "I'm not
doing anything."

00:15:50.718 --> 00:15:55.689
So you become so humble that you forget
all these

00:15:55.889 --> 00:16:01.277
false ideas about class consciousness
or religion consciousness

00:16:01.477 --> 00:16:06.462
or I don't know, all sorts of consciousness
people have.

00:16:06.909 --> 00:16:11.606
I don't know much about these consciousnesses
that human beings suffer from,

00:16:11.807 --> 00:16:17.187
but I've seen how it happens.

00:16:18.731 --> 00:16:25.846
And when that humility becomes your
character, not that you are humble

00:16:26.046 --> 00:16:31.895
because there's something to be done,
you are humble.

00:16:33.732 --> 00:16:36.429
When people are doing some sort of say,
business,

00:16:36.629 --> 00:16:43.463
they will be extremely humble and nice,
but they will be very unkind otherwise.

00:16:43.664 --> 00:16:48.139
Here then, you become absolutely humble

00:16:48.541 --> 00:16:52.858
and there's no duality in your personality
left.

00:16:54.318 --> 00:16:58.316
But that doesn't mean you become weak.

00:16:58.515 --> 00:17:03.429
Humility is only possible for people who
are strong,

00:17:04.481 --> 00:17:12.438
because they don't need any reactions,
they don't need any protection.

00:17:14.145 --> 00:17:19.254
Their humility keeps them protected also,
very much.

00:17:20.183 --> 00:17:27.343
So, you just start thinking or feeling -
thinking is a funny word -

00:17:27.544 --> 00:17:33.411
feeling, that you are a small dust particle.

00:17:33.851 --> 00:17:38.961
At the same time you feel you are the whole
sky.

00:17:42.033 --> 00:17:47.147
It depends on you, where you are, what you
are doing,

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:51.253
what you are seeing, what you are
witnessing.

00:17:53.496 --> 00:18:03.449
Sometimes you feel that all these big, big
johnnies are useless.

00:18:04.158 --> 00:18:08.878
You feel, "Nothing to worry about them,
very small,"

00:18:09.079 --> 00:18:13.137
and with some people you feel you are
very small.

00:18:15.808 --> 00:18:19.847
Such a flexible temperament you developed

00:18:20.048 --> 00:18:24.802
and that makes you subtler and subtler,

00:18:25.039 --> 00:18:29.652
because you can penetrate into anything,
any subject,

00:18:29.853 --> 00:18:34.502
any personality, any understanding,
any book,

00:18:34.701 --> 00:18:41.703
anything - any enterprise in a very subtle
manner,

00:18:41.904 --> 00:18:49.610
and you immediately see what is to be done,
because you become so subtle.

00:18:51.682 --> 00:18:57.534
And then when you become very great, then
you start thinking -

00:18:57.735 --> 00:19:04.054
or I should say feeling - what you can do
to help so many people,

00:19:04.255 --> 00:19:08.652
to do this great job, to do that.

00:19:14.698 --> 00:19:23.711
This, when happens to you, they don't think
that you are egoistical,

00:19:24.810 --> 00:19:29.354
nor you should think that you are very
small.

00:19:31.311 --> 00:19:40.022
Only thing is now you are the Spirit and
Spirit is very subtle.

00:19:40.222 --> 00:19:49.314
It's a very subtle light, but It can
penetrate into anything,

00:19:49.514 --> 00:19:53.881
It could expand into anything,

00:19:54.955 --> 00:20:00.402
It can remain anywhere or It can disappear
anywhere.

00:20:01.502 --> 00:20:09.469
This subtle personality that you are,
which is your Spirit,

00:20:10.668 --> 00:20:16.768
you even don't use It, but It uses you
all the time.

00:20:16.968 --> 00:20:22.993
Without your knowledge It uses you. So
the second thing should be

00:20:23.193 --> 00:20:28.199
that you should not determine what you are
going to do.

00:20:28.454 --> 00:20:35.145
"What I have to do - if I have decided,
I must do like that."

00:20:36.609 --> 00:20:43.582
Whatever you have decided is all right,
but if it does not materialize,

00:20:43.783 --> 00:20:49.593
there's nothing to worry, there's nothing
to be upset,

00:20:49.792 --> 00:20:57.334
there's nothing to be overly nervous
about it.

00:20:58.717 --> 00:21:01.855
I'll give you an example.

00:21:02.976 --> 00:21:09.460
One day I was going to America, and
of course, you know as it is,

00:21:09.661 --> 00:21:14.763
as all the Sahaja Yogis are, they get quite
worried,

00:21:14.963 --> 00:21:18.929
"Now, Mother has to go to America!" I mean,
you see, everybody's upset,

00:21:19.129 --> 00:21:25.537
they are looking at the time, "Now time is
this, time is that." I was just smiling.

00:21:25.738 --> 00:21:30.539
I said, "I have to go to America, why are
you worried?".

00:21:31.848 --> 00:21:37.689
And suddenly one of the Sahaja Yogi's child
fell down and broke her hand

00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:41.622
and she couldn't move her fingers.

00:21:42.143 --> 00:21:47.247
So, I was just coming out, and as soon as
he brought the child,

00:21:47.447 --> 00:21:52.450
I said "All right, I'm not going just now
to the airport."

00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:57.247
They were very upset, "How's She's not
going to the airport?"

00:21:57.447 --> 00:22:01.734
As if all the heavens are going to fall
down or what?

00:22:04.371 --> 00:22:07.066
But I said, "Now, let Me see the child."

00:22:07.267 --> 00:22:10.563
I treated the child; the child was
all right.

00:22:10.764 --> 00:22:13.427
"All right, I said, let's now go to
the airport."

00:22:13.627 --> 00:22:15.700
And they were saying, "Mother, the plane
must have left."

00:22:15.901 --> 00:22:19.365
“It's all right, doesn't matter, let's go
to the airport."

00:22:19.643 --> 00:22:24.487
[We] went to the airport and this plane
that was going to take Me

00:22:24.687 --> 00:22:28.263
was just there because there was something
wrong with the plane

00:22:28.464 --> 00:22:30.203
and there was another plane going
to Washington,

00:22:30.404 --> 00:22:35.320
and I wanted actually to go to Washington,
instead of New York.

00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:40.301
So, I was in the plane nicely going
to Washington.

00:22:43.138 --> 00:22:46.196
But, one must know that you are not
doing it,

00:22:46.397 --> 00:22:52.203
everything is arranged and planned
and beautifully kept for you.

00:22:52.404 --> 00:22:56.685
You decide something, all right, if your
decision is all right,

00:22:56.884 --> 00:22:59.245
if you have to do that, it will work out.

00:22:59.406 --> 00:23:03.984
If it doesn't work out, it should not have
been worked out.

00:23:04.514 --> 00:23:07.910
Now this is the difference between a person
who is a realized soul

00:23:08.111 --> 00:23:10.892
and who is not a realized soul.

00:23:11.092 --> 00:23:16.163
A realized soul person is not bothered

00:23:16.364 --> 00:23:23.530
what he wants, what he likes, what he's
fond of - he's not.

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:27.442
Whatever he gets is all right. Now, you
can see,

00:23:27.643 --> 00:23:33.905
you are living under this roof which is
so horrible, I mean –

00:23:38.341 --> 00:23:41.526
there's no proper arrangements here,
nothing.

00:23:41.726 --> 00:23:46.248
I don't know how you are living here,
I mean, I just don't know what to do.

00:23:46.449 --> 00:23:50.072
And we are trying to get a land and this
landowner

00:23:50.273 --> 00:23:53.161
is such a greedy fellow, but I don't mind
the greed part,

00:23:53.362 --> 00:23:59.290
but still he's not yet giving us the land.
It's all right, now what to do?

00:23:59.603 --> 00:24:03.786
But you all enjoy it, you don't mind -

00:24:03.987 --> 00:24:06.986
otherwise normally people would say,
"You know, I want

00:24:07.187 --> 00:24:12.013
this kind of a room, and I want this kind
of a house, and this and that."

00:24:12.213 --> 00:24:15.861
That you can live under any circumstances

00:24:16.061 --> 00:24:22.739
because you don't worry about your physical
comfort any more.

00:24:24.356 --> 00:24:29.650
What you think of - your own spiritual
comfort.

00:24:32.837 --> 00:24:38.773
I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis,
so beautiful, even children,

00:24:38.974 --> 00:24:41.927
if there is a film going on - something
funny comes in,

00:24:42.127 --> 00:24:44.939
immediately they all close their eyes,
"We don't want to see this".

00:24:45.139 --> 00:24:49.009
Nobody has to tell them because, you see,
they are sort of - inside

00:24:49.209 --> 00:24:56.597
they have built-in that subtle personality
which cannot stand nonsense.

00:24:57.164 --> 00:25:01.768
They won’t - may not say something, they
may not be harsh,

00:25:01.968 --> 00:25:07.979
but just they shun and go away from such
places, automatically.

00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:17.023
So, to describe the new personality is
this way:

00:25:17.494 --> 00:25:22.683
that in the nature we see, very clearly.

00:25:22.883 --> 00:25:29.018
In the nature what we see is, a tree grows,

00:25:29.412 --> 00:25:36.089
now it has to expand, but it cannot, so
it does not.

00:25:36.289 --> 00:25:44.478
If it can, it will, and also it tries

00:25:44.679 --> 00:25:53.118
to bring all the leaves exposed to
the sunlight, somehow.

00:25:53.741 --> 00:25:59.337
I don't think the trees have that much
intelligence to organize it,

00:25:59.538 --> 00:26:04.755
but there is something that organizes
them so beautifully.

00:26:05.564 --> 00:26:11.405
Now, it's not only one tree, thousands and
thousands and thousands and thousands.

00:26:11.739 --> 00:26:20.373
The one who does all that, is the one with
whom you are in contact.

00:26:22.806 --> 00:26:30.843
The trees are not, they are just playing
into the hands of nature,

00:26:31.044 --> 00:26:37.275
but they cannot manipulate, maneuver,
understand

00:26:37.476 --> 00:26:41.703
this Divine power, they cannot.

00:26:42.655 --> 00:26:47.056
Animals cannot, even human beings cannot,

00:26:47.257 --> 00:26:54.983
but you can, because you have crossed
the limit of this human bondage

00:26:55.184 --> 00:27:01.345
and now you are just like great citizens

00:27:01.545 --> 00:27:08.865
of the great realm of divinity.

00:27:09.250 --> 00:27:15.461
So, this Divine Force helps you, works out
everything

00:27:16.429 --> 00:27:23.807
and also It takes you, It guides you,
It manages you.

00:27:24.373 --> 00:27:34.288
So, what you have to do is to keep yourself
open for the guidance.

00:27:34.788 --> 00:27:43.002
At the same time you must act, because
the guidance will also come from within,

00:27:43.202 --> 00:27:48.986
by which you will know, "This is what I
have to do." Now supposing even then,

00:27:49.186 --> 00:27:56.904
you feel that this was not achieved by you
and you feel that,

00:27:57.436 --> 00:28:03.560
"Still I don't know why I couldn't get what
I wanted."

00:28:03.741 --> 00:28:08.819
Try to understand that is what is the best
for us.

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:14.280
But it never means that you should give up,

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.044
you should not desire. I have seen Sahaja
Yogis’ desires

00:28:20.245 --> 00:28:28.280
are much more powerful than Mine. The reason
is: I am desireless,

00:28:28.735 --> 00:28:32.761
I have no desires as such. Try to see,
find them out,

00:28:32.961 --> 00:28:39.958
if I have any desires. I see I have
no desires of any kind

00:28:40.158 --> 00:28:46.234
or I do not earnestly want anything.

00:28:48.215 --> 00:28:52.869
That, you can say it's a very frivolous
temperament.

00:28:53.733 --> 00:28:59.931
But it all, you see, [is] very different
with you people.

00:29:00.192 --> 00:29:05.441
You people are very differently made.

00:29:05.642 --> 00:29:08.915
Because you have achieved something.

00:29:19.140 --> 00:29:25.797
I have not achieved anything. I am what
I am.

00:29:26.745 --> 00:29:29.513
Because you’ve achieved something,

00:29:29.714 --> 00:29:36.537
you know how you were and what you are now.

00:29:39.512 --> 00:29:47.597
Because of your achievement, I think it is
a boon that whatever you desire works out.

00:29:48.974 --> 00:29:53.602
Because you have worked so hard, it's
a boon to you,

00:29:53.803 --> 00:29:58.913
it's a special blessing for you whatever
you desire.

00:29:59.114 --> 00:30:04.537
So… so many times I have told you, "Now
don't desire anything which is not proper",

00:30:04.738 --> 00:30:13.128
because whatever you will desire, that
works out and that will be effective.

00:30:13.612 --> 00:30:20.071
Now try to realize that you are no more
ordinary human beings.

00:30:20.271 --> 00:30:25.729
You have crossed the bondage and now

00:30:25.930 --> 00:30:30.266
you are not even in the Sahasrara, you are
beyond it.

00:30:32.095 --> 00:30:39.024
Sahasrara is the limbic area and this
limbic area is closed

00:30:39.224 --> 00:30:48.064
like a lotus and when you get your
Kundalini entering into it,

00:30:48.265 --> 00:30:52.074
then this lotus opens like this.

00:30:53.229 --> 00:30:58.252
And that's what is - is written
in the Bible, that

00:30:59.947 --> 00:31:05.058
"I'll appear before you like tongues
of flames." It's the Divine saying.

00:31:05.259 --> 00:31:11.708
So these petals are nothing but nerves
which are enlightened,

00:31:11.909 --> 00:31:17.944
just like these, and they look like flames.

00:31:18.144 --> 00:31:24.759
But these flames are not with any heat,

00:31:24.959 --> 00:31:30.177
they call it in Sanskrit tapa-hina, no heat.

00:31:30.377 --> 00:31:37.676
Extremely cooling, soothing, beautifully
burning.

00:31:39.368 --> 00:31:44.712
So when this Sahasrara Lotus opens,

00:31:45.093 --> 00:31:52.586
then the Kundalini pierces through your
fontanel and you get your Realization.

00:31:54.907 --> 00:31:57.871
This is what has happened to you.

00:31:59.592 --> 00:32:05.277
Now only thing is to keep this Lotus open

00:32:07.695 --> 00:32:13.082
and there where we fail, sometimes,

00:32:13.376 --> 00:32:20.342
because still there are some lingering
human failings within us.

00:32:21.469 --> 00:32:29.327
Firstly, it is, as it is, covered with
the ego and the conditioning,

00:32:29.528 --> 00:32:33.145
or we can [say] superego, the two balloons.

00:32:33.346 --> 00:32:42.268
These two balloons, again and again, try
to close the Sahasrara.

00:32:47.963 --> 00:32:50.901
So you have to be,

00:32:58.794 --> 00:33:01.775
you have to be on the guard,

00:33:03.637 --> 00:33:09.347
that "What is closing my Sahasrara?"

00:33:10.752 --> 00:33:16.136
The first is ego, which how to attack,

00:33:16.337 --> 00:33:21.451
because you want to attack your ego, you'll
have to attack through ego only,

00:33:22.055 --> 00:33:25.233
that's the only vehicle.

00:33:29.526 --> 00:33:35.020
So, we have this state of Nirvichara,

00:33:35.221 --> 00:33:39.743
of thoughtless awareness, where we have
to go.

00:33:41.699 --> 00:33:46.941
But the simple thing to do is very
practical.

00:33:47.830 --> 00:33:53.864
Try to understand why you are being
egoistical, with whom are you angry?

00:33:56.162 --> 00:33:58.797
Why are you angry?

00:33:59.837 --> 00:34:04.924
What makes you think to dominate someone
or to control someone

00:34:05.125 --> 00:34:08.366
or to check someone? Why?

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.649
The mind will not answer.

00:34:14.501 --> 00:34:17.866
The simple thing, if you can do,

00:34:18.067 --> 00:34:23.783
that whatever things that upsets you or
makes you feel very great,

00:34:24.767 --> 00:34:31.360
try to understand that compared to you,
nothing is greater.

00:34:33.729 --> 00:34:37.217
Compared to your love, nothing is greater.

00:34:37.417 --> 00:34:40.544
Compared to your compassion, nothing is
greater

00:34:40.745 --> 00:34:46.367
because in this there is the light
of the Divine flowing.

00:34:48.744 --> 00:34:52.545
You hate someone, you get angry with
someone -

00:34:52.746 --> 00:34:57.450
just know that you have to love that person.

00:35:00.184 --> 00:35:04.219
Now, how will you love that person?

00:35:04.419 --> 00:35:11.812
There's no way to have any measurement
of that, but love itself will suggest

00:35:12.013 --> 00:35:17.403
how satisfied you are feeling, how happy
you are feeling.

00:35:19.407 --> 00:35:24.543
I'll give you an example. The other day
I received a letter

00:35:25.154 --> 00:35:30.714
from someone challenging Me very much,
from Poland -

00:35:30.914 --> 00:35:34.617
that her mother is sick with something,
cancer or something,

00:35:34.818 --> 00:35:39.027
and challenging Me all the time. "If You
are God, You must create…

00:35:39.243 --> 00:35:44.159
cure my mother, if You are God, do this,
do that, do that ..."

00:35:44.413 --> 00:35:47.123
Very amusing.

00:35:49.818 --> 00:35:54.350
I said, "All right." I put my attention
to this lady,

00:35:54.550 --> 00:36:01.615
perhaps the mother is better. But, instead
of getting angry, I said,

00:36:01.816 --> 00:36:05.603
"She's so frustrated, she's so upset,
she's so worried,

00:36:05.804 --> 00:36:08.607
even if she says, "If You are God," she's
challenging Me, it's all right,

00:36:08.775 --> 00:36:09.887
makes no difference.

00:36:10.088 --> 00:36:15.331
Whether she calls Me God or not God,
makes no difference. Whatever I am, I am.

00:36:15.532 --> 00:36:22.407
So, instead of getting angry, I felt
tremendous compassion for her.

00:36:24.308 --> 00:36:27.839
She's a human being and her mother is
so sick

00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:33.295
and that's the only source of her life,

00:36:33.496 --> 00:36:37.622
then I can understand why she is so upset.

00:36:43.802 --> 00:36:46.667
So, if you just try, which you can do very
easily,

00:36:46.868 --> 00:36:50.987
very easily, it's not difficult,

00:36:51.479 --> 00:36:56.112
because you are realized souls, I'm talking
to saints.

00:36:56.635 --> 00:37:05.781
If you just put your attention on a person
with love,

00:37:06.761 --> 00:37:10.705
then what happens, you get understanding.

00:37:10.936 --> 00:37:17.343
Understanding of that person, you realize,

00:37:18.755 --> 00:37:22.365
as if identified with that person.

00:37:23.242 --> 00:37:28.068
Then you realize, "If I was in her place,
as a human being,

00:37:28.269 --> 00:37:33.809
what I would have felt? This desperation,
this anger.

00:37:34.010 --> 00:37:38.695
If I was that, if I was the same type
of person,

00:37:38.895 --> 00:37:44.095
with the same kind of problems, then what
would I do?"

00:37:47.857 --> 00:37:53.841
That solves the problem. So
the identification part,

00:37:54.042 --> 00:37:57.441
you have such powers, I told you can
penetrate.

00:37:57.642 --> 00:38:02.408
The identification with another is very
important.

00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:12.541
And you can do it, because you are
realized souls, you can do it.

00:38:13.783 --> 00:38:19.350
Just place yourself in the same position,
like the other person is,

00:38:20.758 --> 00:38:27.707
and then you'll realize that you have
powers of love,

00:38:27.907 --> 00:38:34.902
and identification is the only way I think
one can understand love.

00:38:36.509 --> 00:38:47.610
This ego will immediately sucked in

00:38:47.811 --> 00:38:54.420
as soon as you put your loving attention
on that person.

00:38:59.451 --> 00:39:04.200
In your lifetime you'll get so many
experiences like that,

00:39:05.533 --> 00:39:14.477
that you'll be amazed at yourself, "How can
I do all these things?"

00:39:15.346 --> 00:39:19.057
Because you are a realized soul.

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:26.520
Also, as I said,

00:39:28.627 --> 00:39:32.697
when you are identified with another
person,

00:39:33.293 --> 00:39:38.923
you put that person in charge of divinity -

00:39:44.657 --> 00:39:50.472
just a feeling of oneness.

00:39:53.495 --> 00:40:00.410
Sometimes, also, we have very wrong ideas
about ourselves and about others.

00:40:03.326 --> 00:40:09.638
In small, small things also, we have our
own ideas about something.

00:40:09.839 --> 00:40:17.058
Say, some sort of a living standard some
people have, we like it.

00:40:17.259 --> 00:40:21.683
"I don't like it, I like it and I don't
like it."

00:40:21.884 --> 00:40:27.689
Not a saint, saint never says that.

00:40:28.602 --> 00:40:30.463
That time, when you say that,

00:40:30.664 --> 00:40:34.227
you are falsely identifying yourself with
the baddha of the other person.

00:40:34.428 --> 00:40:36.782
For example, the one, now supposing

00:40:36.983 --> 00:40:42.200
somebody has done such a beautiful flower
arrangement.

00:40:43.688 --> 00:40:47.441
Instead of appreciating and enjoying it,

00:40:47.642 --> 00:40:52.618
if you come and say, "I don't like this,
this could have been better than this."

00:40:57.138 --> 00:41:01.475
Just to sh..(show), I don't know why people
say like that,

00:41:02.237 --> 00:41:05.279
but if you identify yourself with the man
who has done it,

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:08.440
or the gentleman who has done it,

00:41:09.182 --> 00:41:13.587
you will enjoy it the way that person
enjoyed it doing it.

00:41:14.238 --> 00:41:18.797
Because you are just thinking about your
self - self-opinionatedness

00:41:18.998 --> 00:41:21.704
with which you think that this is not done
so good,

00:41:21.905 --> 00:41:26.222
that could have been better, this could
have been better.

00:41:30.095 --> 00:41:33.718
Who are you to judge anyone?

00:41:39.143 --> 00:41:47.842
This criticizing nature comes from
a terrible misunderstanding about oneself.

00:41:48.981 --> 00:41:56.058
What are we? Why should we judge anybody
else, are we paid for it?

00:41:56.259 --> 00:42:00.198
So why waste energy on judging others?

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:10.091
We should see what is good in others,

00:42:12.016 --> 00:42:15.755
because in the realm of reality, it’s
all good, everything fine,

00:42:15.956 --> 00:42:18.472
everything first class.

00:42:20.764 --> 00:42:28.594
But if you are trying to see what's wrong
with others, then you are not in reality.

00:42:30.527 --> 00:42:35.325
You can watch, you can witness,

00:42:36.166 --> 00:42:41.660
but you do not get upset with it or you
do not even say

00:42:41.861 --> 00:42:45.714
something that would upset others.

00:42:46.716 --> 00:42:49.630
You're watching it, it's all beautiful,

00:42:49.831 --> 00:42:55.051
I mean, just the joy of the person who
put it,

00:42:55.252 --> 00:42:58.887
all these beautiful things, of all
the persons,

00:42:59.088 --> 00:43:01.734
is just bubbling through that,

00:43:01.935 --> 00:43:06.715
but unless and until you are identified
with those who have done this,

00:43:06.916 --> 00:43:11.904
you might say this was - this should have
been better, that should have been...

00:43:12.245 --> 00:43:14.970
You can be in the same position.

00:43:15.171 --> 00:43:17.717
Supposing you do something, another one
will come and say,

00:43:17.917 --> 00:43:20.952
"Oh, you should have done it this way,
that way." Wasting our energy

00:43:21.152 --> 00:43:25.756
for nothing at all, our energy is spiritual
energy.

00:43:26.240 --> 00:43:31.558
Then again you become like the sky,
I told you, the greatest,

00:43:31.856 --> 00:43:35.938
you are too great to bother about these
things.

00:43:36.941 --> 00:43:43.059
Wasting our energy on very, very trivial
things and useless things

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.601
and just making yourselves small.

00:43:49.835 --> 00:43:56.317
But if this spiritual energy is used -
because you can use it,

00:43:56.518 --> 00:44:04.467
you are the ones only who can manipulate
it, not the trees, not the flowers -

00:44:05.630 --> 00:44:11.335
then what you will do is to create oceans
of joys.

00:44:12.942 --> 00:44:19.315
So then we come to Sahaj, what has Sahaj
given you is all right.

00:44:20.100 --> 00:44:24.041
But what have you given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:25.688 --> 00:44:29.217
What have I given to Sahaja Yoga?

00:44:32.074 --> 00:44:36.393
Have I created oceans of joys for others?

00:44:41.659 --> 00:44:48.863
What kindness I've shown, what compassion
I've shown,

00:44:49.064 --> 00:44:52.415
what love I have expressed?

00:44:52.829 --> 00:44:57.772
All right, whatever Sahaja Yoga has given,
we have taken it for granted.

00:44:58.724 --> 00:45:05.328
Once they come to Sahaja Yoga, they think
it is a contract, already signed,

00:45:05.529 --> 00:45:09.386
and if this thing doesn't work out, then
what is it? They say, "We had a contract

00:45:09.586 --> 00:45:14.974
with God," and they say, "We have not
been awarded fully

00:45:15.175 --> 00:45:21.702
for whatever we have paid, whatever we
have done."

00:45:21.999 --> 00:45:25.114
But what have you done

00:45:28.812 --> 00:45:33.066
in this realm of reality?

00:45:33.614 --> 00:45:37.391
Have you enjoyed the reality?

00:45:38.748 --> 00:45:49.289
Have you felt the joy of this real love
of Divine?

00:45:52.325 --> 00:46:02.612
Are you dissolved into that, or you're
still standing on the shores watching?

00:46:03.858 --> 00:46:09.494
You can create, you are quite capable
of creating

00:46:09.695 --> 00:46:15.833
tremendous joy, tremendous happiness
and peace.

00:46:16.372 --> 00:46:25.119
See the world today, in what condition
it is, it's complete turmoil, confusion,

00:46:27.049 --> 00:46:40.812
all kinds of corrupt and destructive things
going on.

00:46:42.265 --> 00:46:46.757
So ugly this world has become.

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:51.484
Can you beautify it?

00:46:54.155 --> 00:46:58.177
You can, because you can transform people.

00:46:58.378 --> 00:47:05.849
But if you are not yourself a beautiful
Sahaja Yogi, how can you?

00:47:08.107 --> 00:47:14.635
So, it is our attention on ourselves when
we work out

00:47:15.770 --> 00:47:22.164
that we have to bring others into this
realm of reality.

00:47:23.314 --> 00:47:30.511
This is one side ourselves, where we
have to understand our subtleties.

00:47:30.712 --> 00:47:35.861
The another side is that we are still
identified

00:47:36.061 --> 00:47:40.521
with things which we should not have been
identified.

00:47:42.763 --> 00:47:45.594
We can just find out.

00:47:47.844 --> 00:47:57.457
Identified with ideas, identified with some
sort of a consciousness.

00:48:00.437 --> 00:48:10.667
All these things make you really - to be
very frank, they befool you.

00:48:12.933 --> 00:48:16.882
All the fools, you see,

00:48:17.083 --> 00:48:23.642
who are conditioned are really - I don't
know what to say about them,

00:48:23.843 --> 00:48:33.765
because they are like a train which has
no driver.

00:48:34.805 --> 00:48:38.423
God knows when it is going to collide.

00:48:38.955 --> 00:48:44.933
Because such people who are identified,
I know -

00:48:45.134 --> 00:48:48.964
now you must have seen also, those who go
to church,

00:48:49.165 --> 00:48:52.826
get ready nicely, go to church, sit down
there, sing hymns,

00:48:53.027 --> 00:48:57.097
come home and again quarrel and fight.

00:48:59.633 --> 00:49:03.683
But if they see a church, they'll bow.

00:49:04.064 --> 00:49:07.424
But nothing goes inside, out of that
church.

00:49:07.625 --> 00:49:11.626
Or there are, who are like, you see you
must have seen, the Jews, you see,

00:49:11.827 --> 00:49:16.368
wailing wall they have got, before that
they go, do all kinds of things

00:49:16.569 --> 00:49:20.459
and what happens to them? Nothing.

00:49:20.762 --> 00:49:25.369
Same with the Muslims, they are so
conditioned,

00:49:25.570 --> 00:49:30.965
I mean, you cannot describe their
conditionings, so stupid they are.

00:49:31.695 --> 00:49:36.936
And these conditionings go on making fool
out of us.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:46.222
I've known so many people like that.

00:49:50.476 --> 00:49:58.985
Once in My own life, I was with some
relation of Mine.

00:49:59.186 --> 00:50:03.229
This gentleman used to get up at four
o'clock

00:50:03.430 --> 00:50:08.826
and would start singing some sort of a Ram
Raksha. The whole house is sleeping,

00:50:09.027 --> 00:50:12.811
children are sleeping, he's shouting
at the top of his voice.

00:50:13.012 --> 00:50:19.234
I said, "What is the matter? Even Rama
might be sleeping at this time."

00:50:20.401 --> 00:50:24.854
But he would shout. And his bathing was
another thing,

00:50:25.054 --> 00:50:28.266
everybody knew he's having a bath,

00:50:28.467 --> 00:50:34.743
because he used to sing another shlokas
or something. Go on.

00:50:34.944 --> 00:50:40.594
But it happened that, that I was
in the next room,

00:50:41.181 --> 00:50:43.690
and I heard something like,

00:50:43.891 --> 00:50:47.013
banging, banging, banging. I said,
"What's the matter?"

00:50:47.214 --> 00:50:50.269
I thought he's suffering from epilepsy.
Or what?

00:50:50.470 --> 00:50:55.278
So I rushed to other people and told them,
"This gentleman is suffering from epilepsy."

00:50:55.479 --> 00:50:59.593
He says, "No, he doesn't suffer." I said,
"Then why this sound coming?"

00:50:59.794 --> 00:51:05.474
"No, no, he is, he is rubbing that chandan,
You know, sandalwood."

00:51:05.674 --> 00:51:13.462
And with such a big thud every time, he was
putting that stone on the ground.

00:51:13.662 --> 00:51:16.348
"But I thought he had epilepsy."

00:51:16.549 --> 00:51:21.679
He said, "Whatever you may tell him, he
will never listen, he does that every day."

00:51:23.373 --> 00:51:27.400
What is this? This we understand
as stupidity.

00:51:27.876 --> 00:51:31.615
When we see others, when we see human
beings,

00:51:31.816 --> 00:51:38.828
but even realized souls, you are
in the realm of reality,

00:51:39.029 --> 00:51:48.229
you do accept sometimes unreal things.
Because of age-old conditionings -

00:51:48.927 --> 00:51:52.552
your forefathers like this, his father was
like this, and your forefather's

00:51:52.753 --> 00:51:59.390
forefathers were like this, so that's
still coming. They call it genes.

00:52:00.438 --> 00:52:04.282
But in Sahaja Yoga these genes also change.

00:52:04.483 --> 00:52:09.833
So this kind of a conditioning which is
lingering on still

00:52:10.034 --> 00:52:15.789
to your bodies, to your minds, to your
emotions,

00:52:15.990 --> 00:52:23.423
has to be seen and cleaned out, because
that kills the joy.

00:52:24.137 --> 00:52:28.470
That kills the full experience of reality.

00:52:30.036 --> 00:52:35.296
If you want to have a full experience
of the beauty of reality,

00:52:35.497 --> 00:52:40.211
then you should shed out all these things
which are really befooling you

00:52:40.412 --> 00:52:43.210
morning till evening.

00:52:44.174 --> 00:52:46.426
People take advantage of such people,
very much.

00:52:46.627 --> 00:52:48.907
As I've told you, entrepreneurs, you see,

00:52:49.108 --> 00:52:52.208
they'll start with one fashion, everybody
goes like that.

00:52:52.409 --> 00:52:55.161
But we are not brainless people.

00:52:55.362 --> 00:53:00.372
Not that we have brains, but also
enlightened brains.

00:53:01.087 --> 00:53:05.025
We do not take to things which are just
in the fashion

00:53:05.226 --> 00:53:08.941
or which are something, we don't.

00:53:11.521 --> 00:53:22.036
What we do, we are of our own fashion.

00:53:23.988 --> 00:53:31.093
This is not ego, this is identification
with your own Spirit.

00:53:32.276 --> 00:53:36.396
You won't take to anything stupid and
nonsensical,

00:53:36.597 --> 00:53:39.674
if you have the wisdom of your Spirit
in you.

00:53:39.875 --> 00:53:46.462
So, in the realm of reality, we have
all the seven chakras,

00:53:46.663 --> 00:53:54.073
absolutely enlightened, integrated
and nourished.

00:53:55.916 --> 00:54:06.727
At that position what we see is ourselves,
as I said,

00:54:06.928 --> 00:54:14.549
as nothing limited, absolutely unlimited.

00:54:16.371 --> 00:54:21.850
Even (is/if) - when we say, we penetrate,
we do.

00:54:22.051 --> 00:54:27.867
When we say we expand, we do. When we
contract, we do.

00:54:28.068 --> 00:54:32.899
It's absolutely a flexible personality

00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:43.809
and a personality that creates peace, joy,
harmony.

00:54:46.884 --> 00:54:53.797
With the Sahasrara opening, I'm sure
the whole world would be integrated,

00:54:55.352 --> 00:55:02.344
one day, and we’ll understand these problems

00:55:02.545 --> 00:55:11.233
that are facing us because of stupidity.

00:55:13.062 --> 00:55:17.272
This integration I'm sure will take place,

00:55:19.800 --> 00:55:28.147
and when that takes place, you'll see
the life of the Divine

00:55:28.663 --> 00:55:38.400
will be absolutely outshining all these
darknesses or destructive forces.

00:55:38.804 --> 00:55:41.794
It's going to happen.

00:55:42.373 --> 00:55:47.196
If so many Sahasraras could be opened out,

00:55:47.397 --> 00:55:53.278
then why not the Sahasrara of this world
also is opened out

00:55:53.479 --> 00:55:59.189
to truth and reality? It will.

00:55:59.761 --> 00:56:04.765
So today, on such an important day for us,

00:56:04.966 --> 00:56:11.534
in the history of spirituality, I think
this is a very important day.

00:56:11.735 --> 00:56:21.534
For us is to realize that we are
enlightened, we are the light of joy,

00:56:21.735 --> 00:56:27.821
light of compassion, light of love

00:56:29.849 --> 00:56:38.600
like the silent flames of the Sahasrara,
in different colors, beautifully dancing.

00:56:39.243 --> 00:56:47.114
Then we'll know what is the enjoyment
of reality is.

00:56:47.979 --> 00:56:51.515
May God bless you.
