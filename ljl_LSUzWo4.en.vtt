Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s

07:55.659 --> 08:02.659
Kingdom”
September 9, 1999

08:09.599 --> 08:16.569
Cabella, Italia

08:56.393 --> 08:58.673
Tonight we

08:58.690 --> 09:12.150
are going to worship Shri Krishna as Virat.
First is important to understand the incarnation

09:15.318 --> 09:27.545
of Shri Krishna. Krishna word comes from the
word Krishi. Krishi means agriculture. He’s

09:27.570 --> 09:39.806
sown the seeds of spirituality. And for that,
first of all, He had to think, “Where are

09:39.952 --> 09:52.246
we as far as spirituality is concerned, how
is the land?” So what had happened at the

09:52.271 --> 10:01.896
time of Shri Rama that He created lots of
maryadas and by these maryadas people started

10:01.921 --> 10:07.411
mentally thinking about it, “I am not supposed
to do that, I am not supposed to do this.”

10:07.411 --> 10:15.712
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj. As a result

10:15.737 --> 10:24.283
people became extremely serious. They wouldn’t
talk much and they wouldn’t laugh; they

10:24.771 --> 10:27.306
wouldn’t enjoy anything.

10:27.331 --> 10:34.541
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

10:35.306 --> 10:43.041
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

10:49.345 --> 10:56.391
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

10:56.416 --> 11:11.541
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

11:12.161 --> 11:24.033
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

11:24.750 --> 11:39.303
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

11:39.866 --> 12:00.577
but he’s absolutely detached. And
this detached person doesn’t take to any
grievances, jealousies, all these things.

12:01.538 --> 12:18.561
That He told. But how to achieve it He never
told. And the second thing He described is

12:18.616 --> 12:25.616
that you must work. You have to work. After
all, you have got all the human tendencies

12:26.046 --> 12:34.583
– is to work. But the fruit of the work,
you leave it at the Lotus Feet of God or you

12:34.886 --> 12:41.169
may call the divine Power. This is another
trick of His, because He realized how human

12:41.188 --> 12:46.657
beings were twisted and how they had a ego.
If you tell them something, how they’ll

12:46.657 --> 12:53.657
misinterpret it. So He took the other way
round, that tell them something absurd. Now

12:53.728 --> 13:08.031
whatever work you do, your ego is intact and
with that ego, you can never give it up at

13:08.318 --> 13:15.689
the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.
So He made a impossible situation, that after

13:15.971 --> 13:23.900
some time people will realize that this cannot
be done and they’ll give up this idea of

13:24.558 --> 13:32.603
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the
Divine. This was the one how He prepared the

13:32.628 --> 13:35.718
land.

13:35.718 --> 13:50.793
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.
Flowers, fruit and water. Whatever you offer

13:50.818 --> 13:59.632
Me, I will take it. I’ll take it.” But
when you do that, when you do that you must

13:59.657 --> 14:15.293
have ananya bhakti. Ananya means completely
single-minded bhakti, when there is not the

14:15.318 --> 14:25.252
other. This is only possible after realization.
Only after realization you can put the fruits

14:25.277 --> 14:34.262
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.
And only after Self-realization you can have

14:34.287 --> 14:45.549
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which
is singular. These absurd conditions He put

14:45.578 --> 14:50.688
for human beings because they were so much
complicated.

14:50.688 --> 14:55.308
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

14:55.308 --> 14:55.558
“How?”

14:55.448 --> 15:01.568
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time. We

15:01.568 --> 15:09.885
are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

15:09.910 --> 15:10.650
singing.”

15:11.287 --> 15:22.493
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave. But it is the way He wanted to

15:22.518 --> 15:29.667
neutralize the absurdities of human beings,
that they thought this was the bhakti. Which

15:29.667 --> 15:37.803
is not. Ananya bhakti is only possible when
you are realized soul, when you are connected

15:37.828 --> 15:41.258
with the Divine, when there’s not the other.

15:41.258 --> 15:53.393
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

15:53.648 --> 15:58.018
on their stupidity. Because He thought that
“If I tell them directly do like this, do

15:58.018 --> 16:04.508
like that, then they’ll say, ‘Of course
we did it, and still we never achieved it.’”

16:04.508 --> 16:12.885
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur. For one

16:13.080 --> 16:22.049
month they walk in rags, singing the songs
and on the way they go on eating food at different

16:22.117 --> 16:28.908
places. According to them this is ananya bhakti,
and they achieve nothing. They have become

16:28.908 --> 16:39.408
very sick and very tired and have a very bad
old age. But who can tell them? They are all

16:39.558 --> 16:51.313
lost in it. So this is a way one could tackle
human beings to show their stupidity. And

16:51.338 --> 16:57.248
so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

16:57.248 --> 17:01.677
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

17:01.677 --> 17:10.343
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing. We can say He’s the One who was

17:10.368 --> 17:16.927
like a very great agriculturist. So His name
was Krishi – Krishna. There are so many

17:16.927 --> 17:23.398
things I have told you about Him: how His
name came as Krishna, then as how He was called

17:23.398 --> 17:36.408
as Radha, who was Radha, who was Krishna and
all those things. But when He talked of these

17:36.858 --> 17:43.858
things also He told that you should become
Sthitapragya. That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

17:44.828 --> 17:52.228
Gyana means knowledge. So, you should get
absolute knowledge. That He didn’t say how.

17:52.358 --> 17:58.955
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

17:58.980 --> 18:01.770
in Sahaja Yoga.

18:03.002 --> 18:10.244
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people. He thought by doing

18:10.269 --> 18:16.658
all these things in a stupid manner, they
might develop a discretion to know that this

18:16.658 --> 18:23.038
is not the way you can achieve anything. You
have to get your Self-realization. Discretion

18:23.038 --> 18:33.533
was very important. At this juncture, when
we are facing a sort of a challenge of this

18:34.068 --> 18:42.025
new millennium – that the whole world is
going to be destroyed and all those things

18:42.108 --> 18:50.197
people are talking – it is really very important
to know through discretion what is good and

18:50.222 --> 18:59.900
what is bad. One may talk of something as
very good, something as very bad. But the

19:00.025 --> 19:09.096
divine Discretion is very, very different.
Very different and which acts by Itself. Once

19:09.121 --> 19:14.978
you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

19:15.003 --> 19:16.432
want to do it.

19:16.458 --> 19:28.323
I’ll give you My example. We went to buy
a house and the fellow was, you see, like

19:28.348 --> 19:36.202
a beggar he came. He said, “We have nothing.
We have no food. They have taken away all

19:36.227 --> 19:43.833
our things and we are just absolutely starving.”
When they said that, when he said that “We

19:43.858 --> 19:49.438
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt
pity for him.

19:49.438 --> 19:53.418
I said, “All right, increase the price.”
First we increased the price.

19:53.418 --> 19:56.747
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

19:56.747 --> 20:03.048
Still we increased the price. I told My husband,
“You increase the price.” Though reluctantly,

20:03.048 --> 20:06.878
he increased the price. Third time again we
increased the price.

20:06.878 --> 20:13.878
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

20:14.458 --> 20:19.398
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.” I

20:19.398 --> 20:26.633
just left them and sat in the car – at the
right moment. That was not such a good proposition

20:26.658 --> 20:34.471
or anything. But I could see they, I’m buying
it out of My pity; you may call it compassion.

20:35.247 --> 20:41.578
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

20:41.578 --> 20:48.763
out of it.” So this divine Discretion is
a very, very important thing, which we should

20:48.788 --> 20:56.503
see how it works and should be satisfied with
it. Not to feel bad, that you have missed

20:56.528 --> 21:02.788
a chance or anything, but you must feel very
happy that this thing has happened and that

21:02.788 --> 21:07.878
your divine discretion has taken on.

21:07.878 --> 21:14.798
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

21:14.798 --> 21:21.798
have done something wrong. But if it is divine,
ultimately it will turn out to be very good.

21:21.823 --> 21:31.108
I gave you a very basic example. But that
is also very true when you practice Sahaja

21:34.318 --> 21:44.322
Yoga. The discretion of divine Discretion
is extremely important to play a very great

21:44.400 --> 21:53.702
part in our lives, because this divine Discretion
gives us the real joy of our being, of our

21:53.727 --> 21:55.424
self, of Sahaja Yoga.

21:57.408 --> 22:06.952
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy. But with all these maryadas

22:06.977 --> 22:15.732
of Shri Rama, He didn’t know how to do it.
So to give people joy He said, “All right,

22:15.757 --> 22:24.057
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,
all sorts of things,” and with that He really

22:24.082 --> 22:32.158
originated many things which were sort of
not serious. May look frivolous, but in that

22:32.183 --> 22:43.123
there was joy expressing. All that He did
to give them a full idea as for a Sahaja yogi

22:43.148 --> 22:50.048
or for a, you can say, for a self realized
soul, what should be the attitude towards

22:50.048 --> 22:58.492
everything. But it is not that you have to
do it, but it just works out, it is like that,

22:58.517 --> 23:09.596
that in the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.
Enjoyment. And that is what His idea was,

23:09.737 --> 23:17.543
to create a sense of joy among people. Many
people – there are lots of critics – have

23:17.568 --> 23:21.108
criticized this part of His life. According
to them, religion means you should become

23:21.108 --> 23:30.063
just old. At the age of twenty years you should
become an old man of eighty years – something

23:30.088 --> 23:39.923
like that, funny ideas of religious achievement.
But He talked of joy and He never talked of

23:39.948 --> 23:46.918
renunciation. He never talked that “You
give up your family, you give up your children,

23:46.918 --> 23:55.308
you give up everything,” never, never. He
said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

23:55.858 --> 24:01.977
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment. With

24:01.977 --> 24:09.593
attachment you can never enjoy. If you are
attached to something, you cannot enjoy anything

24:09.618 --> 24:15.247
in a full way. Like, supposing you are attached
to your child. Very simple thing, you are

24:15.247 --> 24:21.678
attached to your child. You’re attached
to your child, then you will be bothered about

24:21.678 --> 24:26.478
things which should not be there, which will
not give joy to the child either. You’ll

24:26.478 --> 24:34.293
not allow your child, say, to go out or to
talk to people, whatever it is – all kinds

24:34.318 --> 24:43.913
of restrictions you will put. But if you have
really the divine discretion, then you will

24:43.938 --> 24:50.568
know with whom he should talk, where he should
go, what he should enjoy and you will see

24:50.568 --> 24:54.175
that he enjoys life.

24:54.200 --> 25:02.580
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

25:02.605 --> 25:14.245
thing. If you are detached, then you can see
it, say, from above … above him, above the

25:14.418 --> 25:21.218
thing. If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also. As I said, now, see the carpets

25:21.218 --> 25:29.862
are there. They are very, very beautiful carpets.
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll

25:29.887 --> 25:34.517
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried
because I am attached – that these carpets

25:34.517 --> 25:40.808
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at

25:40.808 --> 25:47.808
those carpets and what do I see? The joy.
The joy that is put in by the artist who has

25:48.517 --> 26:02.583
made them. And that joy really tries to reflect
in Me also. That joy comes in Me. So to have

26:02.608 --> 26:11.630
anything, attachment to anything, there will
be joy … I should say there’ll be happiness

26:12.137 --> 26:21.583
but not joy. Because joy is single and happiness
is double – happiness and unhappiness.

26:22.647 --> 26:26.887
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

26:26.887 --> 26:36.567
is there.” But joy is all pervading. It
has no boundaries. And you just get dissolved,

26:36.598 --> 26:44.972
you get dissolved in the ocean of joy. That
was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that cut

26:44.997 --> 26:54.247
out these maryadas. Nowadays we see the maryadas
of so many things are really useless. For

26:54.856 --> 27:02.017
example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion. See when they live in maryadas

27:02.228 --> 27:10.661
then what happens? They sort of coggle it
or they have all kinds of germination inside

27:11.678 --> 27:20.075
like the pond, which is absolutely bound,
it is not flowing like river. So like that,

27:20.888 --> 27:33.802
you see, it becomes a kind of a closed mind
with these maryadas. And when you have this

27:33.918 --> 27:41.122
maryadas, you start thinking, “Whether I
should do it or not; whether I’ll enjoy

27:41.147 --> 27:47.278
it or not.” With these maryadas only, you
kill the joy.

27:47.303 --> 27:53.397
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

27:53.397 --> 27:59.818
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

27:59.818 --> 28:06.818
things of their religion, they cannot come.
They think, “This is our religion,” while

28:07.168 --> 28:12.928
they don’t understand. Falsehood becomes
the maryadas and they don’t understand that

28:12.928 --> 28:18.438
what is the maryada actually made by the religion
also.

28:18.438 --> 28:24.968
You see now in Islam what is happening is.
With these maryadas, they want to have another

28:24.968 --> 28:32.552
country, this thing, that thing. In other
Christian religion also same thing happening.

28:32.637 --> 28:39.397
Also in Hindu religion. All these maryadas
are really stagnating them completely, and

28:39.397 --> 28:48.092
they are getting crushed into it. There’s
no discretion. Because they have said it,

28:48.117 --> 28:56.212
they do it. They are so much blind-folded
about it, that they cannot see what is right

28:56.237 --> 29:03.237
and what is wrong. But after Sahaj, you can
see, you can laugh at them and you can see.

29:03.358 --> 29:10.793
Then we have social maryadas. Social maryadas
are there which are sometimes, when abandoned

29:10.818 --> 29:17.818
can become very horrid also. Like in the West
now, the women think that the less dress they

29:18.098 --> 29:28.153
wear, the more beautiful they are. This is
a new thing they have started. Now this absurd.

29:28.458 --> 29:35.943
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

29:35.968 --> 29:44.472
want to have any clothes because we were animals.
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s

29:44.497 --> 29:51.803
why so many women do not want to wear full
dresses. It’s just animal behavior. So the

29:51.828 --> 29:58.828
maryada of – good maryadas also people can
give up saying that “We don’t want any

29:59.088 --> 30:05.137
maryadas. We are free; we can do whatever
we like.” But in that freedom what do you

30:05.137 --> 30:12.137
achieve? Your animal instinct works in that
freedom and you think you are a very free

30:12.162 --> 30:13.308
personality.

30:13.778 --> 30:19.558
Then we have maryadas of our country. God
has not made different, different countries

30:19.558 --> 30:26.763
at all. Nor it is true there are different
countries, but variety is there. Variety of

30:26.788 --> 30:33.788
people, variety of places is there. These
varieties must be accepted as something very

30:34.558 --> 30:41.558
artistic and one should not get ruined and
confused with those ideas that “We are Americans,

30:41.583 --> 30:47.438
we are Indians, we are this and we are that.”
You’re not. Now you can know after Sahaja

30:47.438 --> 30:54.438
Yoga, that you are all Sahaja yogis and you
don’t belong to any country as such. The

30:54.588 --> 30:57.548
country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

30:57.573 --> 31:06.453
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

31:06.478 --> 31:14.763
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

31:14.788 --> 31:21.517
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that. All over the world there’s

31:21.517 --> 31:28.517
going on, “We want this land; we want that
land.” Land belongs to God, not to human

31:28.647 --> 31:34.877
beings. And what is the use of fighting for
land? I don’t understand. But this confusion

31:34.877 --> 31:40.798
is there and illusion is there. And people
work out on this confusion and illusion to

31:40.798 --> 31:45.918
such an extent that they ruin their lives,
the lives of their children. So many people

31:45.918 --> 31:54.307
are lost, so many people are in the lunatic
asylum, I should say, because they end up

31:54.678 --> 32:01.678
in some sort of a refugee camp. They are having
a good house, nicely living there. Then you

32:01.678 --> 32:09.121
become a refugee. Why? Because they believe
that they can have their own land, they can

32:09.146 --> 32:14.968
have their own place and they should live
there.

32:14.968 --> 32:22.092
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

32:22.117 --> 32:29.693
lands and that’s how people fight for land.
There’s no need to fight for land or fight

32:29.718 --> 32:36.127
for your country or fight for this or fight
for that. But the situation is such that unless

32:36.127 --> 32:43.127
and until you fight, you cannot get to the
truth. And that’s why if you remember that

32:43.318 --> 32:51.174
Shri Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.
Fight. You have to fight, that’s your work.

32:51.237 --> 32:57.698
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

32:57.698 --> 33:01.408
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

33:01.408 --> 33:09.643
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

33:09.668 --> 33:18.063
what they deserved. They were deceived, and
this is what Shri Krishna said that “You

33:18.088 --> 33:26.348
should not by any chance become a slave of
these people, but you fight it back.”

33:28.699 --> 33:35.838
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion. Is again the divine discretion

33:36.257 --> 33:41.357
where you have to fight because you don’t
want to be a slave. If you are a slave, you

33:41.357 --> 33:48.863
are no good. So for that you can fight. But
when people start fighting for separation

33:49.218 --> 33:56.816
of a territory, is not correct. On the contrary,
one should never think of separating from

33:56.941 --> 34:04.328
the main lands. Because it creates lots of
problems. But now we believe in the global

34:04.367 --> 34:11.188
religion. We believe in the global territory.
We don’t have to ask for anything. Anywhere

34:11.188 --> 34:20.393
you go, you are the citizen of that place.
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the

34:20.418 --> 34:23.987
whole Russians will be with you. You go to
America, they’ll be with you. That’s how

34:23.987 --> 34:30.918
because all these are ideas of human beings,
and if the human beings get transformed there

34:30.918 --> 34:37.918
will be no problem of any war or any territory
to be achieved.

34:38.197 --> 34:46.012
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us. As you know

34:46.117 --> 34:58.027
that this is a part and parcel of the Vishuddhi
Chakra, where Shri Krishna resides; but when

34:58.316 --> 35:09.373
He rises to your Sahasrara, when He rises
to that level, then He becomes Virata. So

35:09.398 --> 35:22.632
Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head, here
above the Agnya, and this Virat is the form

35:22.657 --> 35:33.183
of Shri Krishna who has risen above the Agnya.
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become

35:33.268 --> 35:43.783
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can
say. Because, unless and until you are above

35:43.808 --> 35:52.882
your ego, you are still involved with yourself
and with wrong ideas of maryadas. But when

35:52.907 --> 36:00.832
you rise above that and you become the Virat,
the great, then you are in the land of Virata.

36:01.480 --> 36:09.519
And Virata’s powers are tremendous. Has
been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

36:09.988 --> 36:18.152
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally. It acts in such a manner

36:18.427 --> 36:31.554
that you sit here and anywhere it can act.
You have seen that now. Many a times people

36:31.617 --> 36:38.907
say, “Mother it’s a miracle. My mother
was sick and she was not here and I just prayed

36:38.927 --> 36:45.617
and she got all right.” This is all the
power of Virat.

36:45.617 --> 36:54.143
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

36:54.168 --> 37:01.563
a manner that everything we are connected
with. We are not separate. And every drop

37:01.588 --> 37:09.273
is connected with the ocean. We are connected
with the whole universe. And when you become

37:09.298 --> 37:20.383
a citizens, I should say, of Virat, then all
the things with which you are connected also

37:20.418 --> 37:33.983
get your vibrations, your ideas, your ambitions.
Everything passes through that and it works

37:34.008 --> 37:35.766
– it works.

37:35.791 --> 37:42.918
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives. It is the Virata Shakti

37:42.985 --> 37:57.358
that works. Now for that we have to know how
to do worship of Virata. First of all you

37:57.558 --> 38:07.855
have to rise above your ego – very important.
Otherwise how can you worship? There is your

38:08.566 --> 38:17.402
ego standing in between and how can you rise
up to the point of Virat? You have to pass

38:17.478 --> 38:27.603
through that. Once you are above your ego,
you enter into the kingdom of Virata. There

38:27.628 --> 38:36.285
the King is the Virat and you are the subject
who are looked after completely by Virata

38:36.458 --> 38:40.058
Shakti, by the power of Virata.

38:40.058 --> 38:47.632
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

38:47.657 --> 38:54.617
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

38:54.617 --> 39:01.617
to you. Supposing a person is of that level.
Now there may be a war in some other country

39:02.367 --> 39:13.746
– it can stop. Somebody who is being oppressed
can win over. Anywhere your compassion moves

39:14.268 --> 39:20.488
it works out. Whenever your attention will
go, it will work out. And sometimes you are

39:20.488 --> 39:27.318
surprised as to how it works, “Mother, how
these things work out? How coincidences … how

39:27.318 --> 39:34.822
these coincidences have taken place?” Only
thing is you have crossed that state of your

39:34.847 --> 39:41.718
ego and have gone into the state of Virat,
which is a very important thing to do – is

39:41.718 --> 39:48.718
to enter into the area of Virata. Then you
don’t think, “This is your country. This

39:48.847 --> 39:50.887
belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

39:50.887 --> 39:58.902
This belonging business finishes off. Then
you belong to Virat. And He uses you for His

39:58.927 --> 40:07.226
own purpose in the sense that when your whole
thinking is different – becomes global thinking,

40:07.398 --> 40:17.671
then He acts. And then His powers are many-fold.
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch

40:17.748 --> 40:25.993
to call people. I have given conches to all
the leaders. So we have to now announce and

40:26.018 --> 40:37.269
call people. But at the level of Virat, you
don’t have to do all that. At the level

40:37.318 --> 40:47.913
of Virat it just – people see, they’ll
know. Just they will watch you and they will

40:47.938 --> 40:57.012
know. Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

40:57.058 --> 41:04.058
shining all the time. So, they’ll be impressed.
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

41:04.238 --> 41:11.824
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

41:11.858 --> 41:19.513
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

41:19.538 --> 41:28.613
are actually not true. And all these things
on which you want to exist are no more. People

41:28.638 --> 41:41.853
like to show off their wealth, some people
like to be very sort of demonstrative of what

41:41.878 --> 41:50.691
they think they are. But in the case of a
person who rises above his ego, and he’s

41:50.788 --> 41:58.894
a part and parcel of that Virata shakti, enters
into the kingdom of Virata, he knows he is

41:58.937 --> 42:07.333
very small. He is very small compared to that
and he just dissolves into that Shakti. And

42:07.358 --> 42:14.793
this should happen to us that we should humble
down. We should humble down and know that

42:14.818 --> 42:22.590
our powers, whatever we have, if they give
us ego, we should get rid of it. We should

42:22.855 --> 42:31.121
not have that ego. We should get rid of it
and we should actually achieve that state

42:31.298 --> 42:38.683
where you can be called as citizens of the
Virata’s Power.

42:38.708 --> 42:44.230
May God bless you all.

44:43.223 --> 44:47.293
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have

44:47.576 --> 44:57.871
like children. You are children there. As
children you enter. As Christ has said, “When

44:57.896 --> 45:01.346
you enter into the Kingdom of God
you have to

45:01.354 --> 45:04.571
be like children.” And that’s what you
have to

45:04.596 --> 45:06.688
be today, all of you to

45:06.713 --> 45:11.032
be innocent like children. You have to

45:11.057 --> 45:15.158
be innocent like children.

48:13.805 --> 48:20.805
to be
