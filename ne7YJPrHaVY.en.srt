1
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,896
Today again is

2
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:11,446
a new year's day. Every new year comes, because
we have to take to something that is new.

3
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:20,872
It has been so arranged that the sun has to
move for 365 days and again a new year has

4
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:28,142
come.
Actually the whole Solar System is moving

5
00:06:28,311 --> 00:06:39,467
in a spiral way. So, there is definitely a
higher, higher state of this Solar System.

6
00:06:40,335 --> 00:06:49,480
Every year it is rising higher in a spiral
way. So it is not only that it is because

7
00:06:49,505 --> 00:06:58,545
365 days have passed, it is because it has
moved a step forward, higher than what it

8
00:06:59,995 --> 00:07:05,576
was.
Now, we can see that in awareness, human beings

9
00:07:05,576 --> 00:07:12,525
have definitely risen much higher than what
they were, say, about 2000 years back. But,

10
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:23,697
the first system that started the whole Universe
was the first model, you can say was created.

11
00:07:24,285 --> 00:07:31,285
And that model has to be perfect. And that
was a perfect model which then started perfecting

12
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,689
the rest of it.
So that is the perfect model which is in the

13
00:07:36,714 --> 00:07:51,921
principle of this ascent. And that is working
out this ascent. Now, the perfection of the

14
00:07:52,874 --> 00:07:59,285
rest of the universe takes place in various
directions.

15
00:07:59,285 --> 00:08:06,272
But today we have to consider the Mahalakshmi
Principle. The Mahalakshmi, as I told you,

16
00:08:06,297 --> 00:08:15,301
is a perfect principle. It's a perfect principle.
It's perfected. It is born as perfect, will

17
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:20,921
remain as perfect, will be always eternally
perfect so that it is not necessary to be

18
00:08:20,946 --> 00:08:27,311
corrected.
Now this Mahalakshmi's thing I am discussing

19
00:08:27,336 --> 00:08:38,569
here because you may be able to go today to
see the temple of Mahalakshmi. Now the temple

20
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:46,680
of Mahalakshmi when you go there, you have
to know that this deity has come out of the

21
00:08:46,705 --> 00:08:57,944
Mother Earth in this particular place. That
means this place has got a capacity to give

22
00:08:58,336 --> 00:09:08,321
you a force. You can say, an additional force
or an intensive feeling of evolution. If you

23
00:09:08,346 --> 00:09:14,136
are sensitive enough you can see that, you
can feel it and you can do it. But, if you

24
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:20,906
are not so sensitive, you are still so conditioned
and still outside, that may not work out.

25
00:09:20,906 --> 00:09:27,402
I mean all kinds of things can be done, but
if somebody wants to remain a stone you can't

26
00:09:27,427 --> 00:09:34,265
do anything about it.
So this Mahalakshmi principle is working out

27
00:09:34,265 --> 00:09:40,387
in this place Kolhapur. Normally, this place
should be very, very warm because of its position.

28
00:09:40,412 --> 00:09:48,770
But even in summer this place keeps very cool
because of the vibrations from the temple

29
00:09:48,795 --> 00:09:59,121
that is emitted. The people in this place
may not be so aware either. We cannot say

30
00:09:59,406 --> 00:10:05,556
if they are aware because, as negativity has
to come forward, there are lots of sugar factories

31
00:10:05,556 --> 00:10:15,902
and lots of alcoholism going on here.
But we have to take the best advantage of

32
00:10:15,927 --> 00:10:22,471
every place which is created specially for
a particular purpose. So, it is a pilgrimage,

33
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:29,988
in a way, that we are here. That we have to
look after our Mahalakshmi Principle of our

34
00:10:30,986 --> 00:10:40,348
ascent. As you know, this ascent starts at
the Nabhi and is surrounded by the Guru principle.

35
00:10:43,266 --> 00:10:50,266
Now the Guru Principle within us, if it is
absurd, if it is juxtapositioned, placed in

36
00:10:50,896 --> 00:10:57,896
juxtaposition where, if it is not properly
embedded within us, if it is not emitting

37
00:10:58,156 --> 00:11:03,172
through our character and behaviour, Mahalakshmi
tattwa cannot be strengthened.

38
00:11:03,197 --> 00:11:11,890
Mahalakshmi tattwa is strengthened through
Guru principle. Now we are lucky today because

39
00:11:11,915 --> 00:11:19,547
there was the birthday of Datta, Dattatreya,
just the other day, when we had the puja,

40
00:11:19,616 --> 00:11:24,956
and today is this Mahalakshmi puja. So two
things together we have got together. First

41
00:11:24,956 --> 00:11:31,576
was the Datta puja and today is this puja
of Mahalakshmi. So, to have the Guru principle

42
00:11:31,576 --> 00:11:37,626
all right, we must make our dharmas correct.
Now these dharmas, as I have told you many

43
00:11:37,626 --> 00:11:45,219
times, are ten, and we should look after these
ten dharmas in a very careful manner. These

44
00:11:45,244 --> 00:11:50,064
are expressed outside, but whatever is inside
comes out.

45
00:11:50,446 --> 00:11:56,456
Now I find, when you people talk, and you
say things, I know that this person is negative,

46
00:11:56,456 --> 00:12:02,934
that person is definitely positive. There
are so many ways of expression of positivity.

47
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:10,020
But how I know that, I cannot tell you, because
I just don't know how to tell you that. But

48
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:15,012
I just know that such a person is definitely
positive and such a person is negative. The

49
00:12:15,037 --> 00:12:23,130
positivity lies in understanding why are we
here. First of all, why are we on this earth?

50
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:36,192
Why are we human beings? In understanding!
What are we doing about it? Why are we Sahaja

51
00:12:36,217 --> 00:12:45,990
Yogis? What a Sahaja Yogi has to do? What
is his responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi. Then

52
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:57,247
he moves forward to understand -- why Mother
is so kind to me? Why have I got vibrations?

53
00:12:57,614 --> 00:13:02,894
Why am I among very few who have got this
special blessing, the special knowledge of

54
00:13:02,919 --> 00:13:15,560
vibratory awareness. And then to ask yourself,
"What am I doing about it? Am I still very

55
00:13:15,585 --> 00:13:23,482
much embedded in my cheapishness or in my
childishness, in my stupidity, in my harshness,

56
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:28,140
in my aggressiveness?"
We always see these things in other people,

57
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:33,090
not in ourselves -- so we are not Sahaja Yogis.
We should understand at that point. When we

58
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:37,300
start seeing these things in other people,
then we are not Sahaja Yogis. We should see

59
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:49,383
in ourselves and emit pure compassion to others.
But always people see that it is in another

60
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:53,852
person this exists. Whatever I may try to
say they always see in other person. Now supposing

61
00:13:53,877 --> 00:13:59,164
there's a negative person among us, you need
not be compassionate to that person. On the

62
00:13:59,189 --> 00:14:05,190
contrary better be away. Get rid of that person,
as far as possible don't have anything to

63
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:10,844
do [with them]. Is a definite sign of great
compassion to yourself, if not to others.

64
00:14:11,055 --> 00:14:17,300
Better not have anything to do with the person
who is negative, if you have to come up. He

65
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:23,953
may be your brother, sister, anyone. But try
to be away from a person who is not positive.

66
00:14:23,978 --> 00:14:30,728
It causes lots of problems. I have been telling
you this, and I have been requesting you,

67
00:14:30,753 --> 00:14:37,150
but the conditioning is such that, still though
you have become a Guru tattwa, you don't understand

68
00:14:37,150 --> 00:14:40,330
that you have to be detached.
For the Guru there's no brother, sister or

69
00:14:40,330 --> 00:14:46,101
any other relationship except for the relationship
of the Mother. There is no other relationship.

70
00:14:46,126 --> 00:14:52,956
One of these principles are to be understood.
Very important I feel is for all of you that

71
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:59,721
-- our relationship is only to Mother and
to Sahaja Yogis and not to any relationship

72
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:06,586
which has come to us, whether through Sahaja
Yoga or whether through anything else. Now

73
00:15:06,611 --> 00:15:14,980
this I have been explaining because our Mahalakshmi
Tattwa is not all right. That's why we get,

74
00:15:15,323 --> 00:15:26,325
sort of, frittered away, lost, into these
things. And the Mahalakshmi tattwa has to

75
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:33,350
be like an ascending force all put together.
Like my father used to give an example. That

76
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:41,097
supposing you have collected lot of wheat
and you spread it on the ground, it will be

77
00:15:41,122 --> 00:15:45,652
all lost. It will be spread out like this,
this side, that side, it will be all lost.

78
00:15:45,698 --> 00:15:51,878
But if you put it in a bag, it will rise in
height. Naturally! It will have those maryadas.

79
00:15:51,878 --> 00:15:57,888
It will rise and it will go higher and higher.
In the same way this principle of Mahalakshmi

80
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:07,041
can spread just across like that, and can
just destroy all that Mother has given us

81
00:16:07,168 --> 00:16:12,955
and all that we have had all these years,
only by spreading it out.

82
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:19,072
Now to collect it inside, is to pay attention
to yourself. First of all, try to clarify

83
00:16:19,072 --> 00:16:26,697
your ideas and your understanding in [the]
brain. Is important, because Mahalakshmi tattwa

84
00:16:26,722 --> 00:16:33,959
ultimately works in the brain. Is the enlightenment
of the brain, is done by Mahalakshmi tattwa.

85
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:40,927
It gives you the Sat, the Truth, you see.
So in the brain you must clarify. Reach logically.

86
00:16:40,952 --> 00:16:52,265
Logically you must reach the conclusion, "I
don't have to do these things, I have to do

87
00:16:52,472 --> 00:17:01,617
these things. I have to ascend. This is why
I am here. Why I am here? What am I supposed

88
00:17:01,642 --> 00:17:05,702
to do?" Now logically you convince your brain,
first of all. This is very important now,

89
00:17:05,727 --> 00:17:11,679
after realisation. Because if logically your
brain doesn't understand, it will always be

90
00:17:11,704 --> 00:17:20,538
cheapish, childish, indignified or could be
harsh, horribly oppressive. It could be one

91
00:17:20,563 --> 00:17:25,742
of these.
So, in Guru tattwa, there are ten elements.

92
00:17:25,767 --> 00:17:34,304
Five of them deal with the weight. Weight.
Guru is the weight you see. Weight of a person.

93
00:17:36,117 --> 00:17:41,358
How much weight you have got? The gravity,
as we call it. Person has a gravity. When

94
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:46,975
he talks how much balance he has got. See
in Indian Music, we call it Vazan, means the

95
00:17:47,031 --> 00:17:52,319
weight. The weight of the person, means when
he is dealing with himself or with others,

96
00:17:52,344 --> 00:17:57,214
how much weight he carried. In English also
they use this -- weight. How much weight he

97
00:17:57,239 --> 00:18:05,006
carries with others? Means, how much he can
really impress others? If you impress too

98
00:18:05,031 --> 00:18:08,027
much, all right, then the person will say,
'Oh, it's too much.' That is the very big

99
00:18:08,052 --> 00:18:17,144
quality with western people is, "Oh, that
is too much!" That's because they have an

100
00:18:17,452 --> 00:18:19,683
idea, you see. This is all ego oriented. That
is too much. If you tell them too much, "Oh!

101
00:18:19,708 --> 00:18:24,683
that is too much. She is too much. I do it
slowly, slowly. It is too much for me!" Is

102
00:18:24,708 --> 00:18:30,487
very common, is very common reaction. So how
much weight you have.

103
00:18:30,757 --> 00:18:39,292
And the second one is the quality of magnetic.
Two things. Magnetism. First is the quality

104
00:18:39,325 --> 00:18:48,823
of weight. That's how much dignified you are.
How you talk. How your language is. How your

105
00:18:48,848 --> 00:18:55,848
behaviour is. You should be humorous, but
sometimes, even with me, I find people talk

106
00:18:55,873 --> 00:19:02,706
in a very funny manner. I just don't understand,
how is it that always they say the wrong things?

107
00:19:02,731 --> 00:19:07,222
I mean, even if they have to say one sentence,
they'll say a wrong thing. Is absolutely with

108
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:10,855
them. It is also Vishuddhi, which is also
Nabhi, comes from Nabhi, because you must

109
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,519
know that Vishuddhi Chakra is the ascent of
the Nabhi Chakra.

110
00:19:15,544 --> 00:19:21,725
So what happens, that a person whatever he
is, is expressed through his language, through

111
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,956
his behaviour, through his face, through his
nose, his eyes, everything, through the Vishuddhi

112
00:19:26,981 --> 00:19:32,647
Chakra. So the ascent of the Nabhi is expressed,
shown, through the Vishuddhi Chakra. Now whatever

113
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:39,120
you have in the Nabhi is shown here. Supposing
now, a person who has the Mahalakshmi tattwa

114
00:19:39,145 --> 00:19:46,603
properly developed, such a person will have
a way of dealing with another person where

115
00:19:46,628 --> 00:19:55,462
he will have the weight as well as the understanding
[of] how far to go with the person. How far

116
00:19:55,487 --> 00:20:04,025
to carry on with the person. How far to talk
to a person. How far to think about it. How

117
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,920
much importance to be given. That's one point,
is very important.

118
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:13,884
And the another point is that -- how much
magnetism you have? So you reverse back to

119
00:20:13,909 --> 00:20:21,173
yourself. The magnetism is a magic, is a magic
of a person. A person is magnetic because

120
00:20:21,198 --> 00:20:29,720
he has certain magic. Now this magic is, comes,
from your own personality. From your own personality.

121
00:20:29,871 --> 00:20:38,423
The basis of magnetism, on the left hand side,
starts. And that basis is Shri Ganesha. Shri

122
00:20:38,448 --> 00:20:44,580
Ganesha is the basis of that magnetism. So
you're innocent. Innocence is the best way

123
00:20:44,605 --> 00:20:50,705
to have that magnetism. Magnetism you cannot
express in material way. It's not a material

124
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:58,783
stuff but it is something abstract, comes
from your quality of Ganesha, Shri Ganesha.

125
00:20:58,808 --> 00:21:06,267
Such a person is magnetic. Magnetic means
that such a person attracts other person because

126
00:21:06,292 --> 00:21:13,292
of the weight of the person, because of the
quality of the person such a person attracts.

127
00:21:13,317 --> 00:21:21,602
But does not attract for lust, greed and nonsensical
things. But attracts another person because

128
00:21:21,627 --> 00:21:28,308
of the fragrance of love in the subjects.
Now it is always confused. Confused!. Because

129
00:21:28,333 --> 00:21:33,333
it's such an abstract thing so one must understand
it in a very subtle way. What is this magnetism?

130
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:38,540
That one should understand. You see, there
some gestures people use artificially. Which

131
00:21:38,565 --> 00:21:42,048
normally they have been using just to attract
other people, the way they walk, the way they

132
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:48,884
dress, the way they live. All these things
are of no use. It is something so inner, that

133
00:21:48,909 --> 00:21:55,251
fragrance is so inner which must be developed.
But in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, people just

134
00:21:55,276 --> 00:21:58,737
don't bother about it, just don't bother.
They think the way they have been living,

135
00:21:58,762 --> 00:22:02,991
the way they have been this...say, if they
are English, they are English, if they are

136
00:22:03,016 --> 00:22:06,383
French they are French, if they are Indians
they are Indians, if they are from Kolhapur

137
00:22:06,408 --> 00:22:14,430
they will be from Kolhapur. These ideas first
must be curbed off, because the fragrance

138
00:22:14,494 --> 00:22:18,133
spreads everywhere whether you are English
or anyone.

139
00:22:18,133 --> 00:22:23,744
So the fragrance of a person develops through,
first of all, the Ganesha principle within

140
00:22:23,744 --> 00:22:30,744
you. Ganesha principle is to be first of all
seen to. Now a Ganesha person is not a person

141
00:22:30,769 --> 00:22:41,064
who is absolutely a remorse type or a person
who is such a gone case that even if you beat

142
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:49,368
him up and make him into a complete minced
thing, he will bear it. It's not like that!

143
00:22:49,614 --> 00:22:56,614
It's not that. On the contrary the quality
of magnetism is such that it attracts you,

144
00:22:56,754 --> 00:23:03,754
to a point where you are not disturbed. Now
this is a very important point we should know.

145
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:11,484
You see, if you have other loves, love like
carnal love and all other love you have, then

146
00:23:11,509 --> 00:23:16,234
that love you may attract the person. That
person can destroy you and it destroys you,

147
00:23:16,234 --> 00:23:24,928
always. But this attraction does not destroy,
does not destroy. The attraction is up to

148
00:23:24,953 --> 00:23:31,124
that point that you are not destroyed, because
you being much higher, much deeper and much

149
00:23:31,124 --> 00:23:37,244
weightier, you cannot be destroyed by a thing
that you are attracting. Always the greater

150
00:23:37,244 --> 00:23:46,069
magnet attracts the smaller magnet. And that
is what one should understand. This magic

151
00:23:46,094 --> 00:23:54,242
and this karishma, the charismatic temperament
of a person comes by, first of all, the Ganesh

152
00:23:54,364 --> 00:24:01,313
tattwa, innocence. And secondly by complete
dedication and devotion.

153
00:24:01,868 --> 00:24:10,844
Those who are completely dedicated and devoted
to Mother. Not to anything else. Ganesh tattwa

154
00:24:10,869 --> 00:24:16,780
again. Not to your wife, not to your husband,
not to your sister, not to your country, not

155
00:24:16,805 --> 00:24:29,524
to anyone but to Mother. Complete dedication
gives you that charisma, or that attraction.

156
00:24:29,828 --> 00:24:36,156
In Sahaja Yoga such a person becomes really
attractive and such a person has ??????.

157
00:24:36,195 --> 00:24:36,976
Now some

158
00:24:37,023 --> 00:24:58,054
people think that if you are a very passive
person and if anybody says anything to you

159
00:24:58,275 --> 00:25:06,429
and you don't mind, sort of a person you are
charismatic. It is not. People like you because

160
00:25:06,485 --> 00:25:13,760
they can dominate you. They like you because
they can dominate you. Now if you think that

161
00:25:13,785 --> 00:25:19,525
by your aggressiveness and by your shouting
and by your screaming at these people, you

162
00:25:19,525 --> 00:25:29,069
will achieve that charismatic temperament,
you cannot. You cannot achieve that height.

163
00:25:29,555 --> 00:25:35,346
So how do you achieve it? By becoming more
innocent.

164
00:25:35,346 --> 00:25:42,346
Now how innocence develops in a person is
by not thinking about it. Like, you see, somebody

165
00:25:42,566 --> 00:25:49,566
asked me, 'How do you manage your Income Tax?'
I said, 'By having no income at all'. Then

166
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:55,216
they asked me, 'How do you solve your car
problem?' "By not having any car at all of

167
00:25:55,216 --> 00:25:57,826
mine." They said, 'What about your house problem?"
"By having no house of my own."

168
00:25:57,826 --> 00:26:01,135
"Nihi, Nihi." Everything Nihi for me. Then
how do you solve your this problem? By not

169
00:26:01,135 --> 00:26:09,889
having it, just have -- "No, not have it!"
Don't take up headaches upon yourself.

170
00:26:10,446 --> 00:26:15,966
See when you take up headaches upon yourself
then only the innocence is reduced. That headaches

171
00:26:15,966 --> 00:26:22,966
like this, that "This is my shawl, this is
my sari, this is my thing, this is this, this

172
00:26:23,405 --> 00:26:29,380
is this, this is this". But only one thing
is that "This is my Mother and I have to proclaim

173
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:39,186
Her", that's all.
If that is the way it is, then innocence starts

174
00:26:39,446 --> 00:26:48,747
rising like Shri Ganesha, and by having no
other headache. "This is mine, that is mine."

175
00:26:48,772 --> 00:26:53,925
This 'mine' business causes the problem, I
think. Personally, I think this must be the

176
00:26:53,925 --> 00:26:58,505
reason. That this 'mine' business. 'This is
mine.' Because whatever is mine. Somebody

177
00:26:58,505 --> 00:27:04,365
told me, this is very good argument he gave,
"Whatever is mine is not I", means that is

178
00:27:04,365 --> 00:27:11,055
not Sahaja. My body, my head, my everything
-- 'my'. But 'I' He gave me this idea -- 'I'.

179
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:18,055
What is 'I'? Then 'I' is separating, Whatever
is not mine is 'I'. So what remains is your

180
00:27:18,305 --> 00:27:22,946
Spirit. Somebody gave me this argument. I
said "Is a very good argument to work it out".

181
00:27:22,946 --> 00:27:32,879
Then whatever remains is the 'I' and that
'I' is the one we have to see! So you go on

182
00:27:32,925 --> 00:27:39,456
reducing all these 'mines', 'mines', 'mines'.
So the pure spirit of innocence will rise.

183
00:27:39,481 --> 00:27:46,481
So the idea about Spirit also, people think
that if you become spiritual -- I mean, I

184
00:27:46,506 --> 00:27:52,447
don't know what people think about spiritual
people. But the idea about spiritual people

185
00:27:52,472 --> 00:27:58,031
is that you have to be something terrific
like a bull or I don't know. You have to be

186
00:27:58,056 --> 00:28:07,315
sharp like a fox or you have to be intellectual
like Freud or something. All sorts of ideas

187
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:17,452
people have. No, it is not! Spiritual person
is just innocent, just innocent. There is

188
00:28:17,477 --> 00:28:24,396
no intelligence, nothing. Just innocent. The
whole thing is innocence. See, whatever he

189
00:28:24,396 --> 00:28:29,696
talks or says, comes through innocence. It
doesn't have intellect as such, which here

190
00:28:29,696 --> 00:28:33,286
people have through reading and through understanding
and by analysing. Nothing of the kind. It

191
00:28:33,286 --> 00:28:43,627
just has pure and simple innocence. And it
all works out very well. It is so clean. It

192
00:28:43,652 --> 00:28:50,652
just says what it knows and what it knows
is the highest.

193
00:28:52,494 --> 00:29:01,222
So this deconditioning has to be brought within
us. But you should not discuss it among yourselves

194
00:29:01,247 --> 00:29:08,095
also. Once you start discussing then you also,
you see, it becomes sort of a theological

195
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:13,892
argumentation. There is no theology about
it. It's very simple. It's the simplest thing

196
00:29:13,946 --> 00:29:21,845
is to be innocent. But the innocence is lost.
Why? Because our attention is in different

197
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:27,228
way, we are attentive to other things. We
are looking at other things. It's so simple,

198
00:29:27,252 --> 00:29:31,923
you know. Today I was thinking I have to buy
three nine-yard saris. A simple question as

199
00:29:31,923 --> 00:29:36,362
it is, because there were three ladies who
wear nine yard saris and I had to give them

200
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:40,242
three nine yard saris. That is all. I just
thought of it. All right. I came here, I saw

201
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:43,803
very nice saris being put here. So I asked
her, 'Where do you get?' She said 'You get

202
00:29:43,803 --> 00:29:49,154
it here'. I said 'All right'. So you go and
buy these three saris. No analysis, nothing

203
00:29:49,179 --> 00:29:52,450
of the kind. It just came into my mind that
I have to buy three saris, finished! The answer

204
00:29:52,497 --> 00:30:02,549
is here. So even the atmosphere is so innocent,
the whole situation is so innocent that the

205
00:30:02,549 --> 00:30:05,978
solution is presented by innocence to innocence.
Innocence works out in everything, you see,

206
00:30:05,978 --> 00:30:11,168
because everybody has little bit of innocence
in every one, isn't it? So you can...it's

207
00:30:11,168 --> 00:30:20,259
like a fifth column, you see. The innocence
is a fifth column within you. So if any person

208
00:30:20,284 --> 00:30:25,498
is innocent, you see he'll work on your fifth
column and will make you all right. When you

209
00:30:25,498 --> 00:30:31,495
give bandhan to others, what happens, you
actually bind him by your innocence and the

210
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:38,495
poor fellow doesn't know. He has his innocence
within him, you capture that innocence, that

211
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:43,120
is all you have done, that's how you manage.
It's very simple to work out things. Only

212
00:30:43,145 --> 00:30:52,260
principle, the tattwa, the whole thing rests
on what? Tattwa is nothing but innocence.

213
00:30:53,408 --> 00:30:58,868
So try to develop this by all these things...
"Ya neti, neti wachane nigamor awachus" By

214
00:30:58,868 --> 00:31:03,988
saying "Not this, not this, not this, not
this, not this," to all your thoughts. "Not

215
00:31:03,988 --> 00:31:10,988
this not this, not this, not this". You reach
there. 'Not mine, not mine, not mine, not

216
00:31:14,618 --> 00:31:20,819
mine". And that is how it is.
And you see the whole material world is now

217
00:31:20,819 --> 00:31:27,819
attacking the innocence, because they are
frightened. You cannot attack it. Innocence

218
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:34,838
cannot be destroyed. It cannot be destroyed.
Innocence is something [which] is all pervading

219
00:31:34,838 --> 00:31:39,199
and it cannot be destroyed. So whatever people
may try, it cannot be destroyed. But it can

220
00:31:39,199 --> 00:31:49,054
be covered, it can recede, but it cannot be
destroyed. It will act it's own way. So try

221
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:56,693
to develop that innocence which is the basis
of Mahalakshmi Tattwa, we should say, or that

222
00:31:56,718 --> 00:32:02,788
is essence of Mahalakshmi tattva.
So the outward things, the weightage, the

223
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:07,128
weight, the dignity, the behaviour everything.
It is outward thing and the inside thing -- the

224
00:32:07,128 --> 00:32:11,569
tattwa, the principle, on which it is based
is innocence.

225
00:32:11,569 --> 00:32:19,806
Now if, with this, if we understand Mahalakshmi
tattwa within us, how it has to work out.

226
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:24,972
It's not intellectual! Again I would say that
I don't want you to project your intellect

227
00:32:24,997 --> 00:32:29,230
into it, and to find out, but just remain
where you are and you will find the answers

228
00:32:29,255 --> 00:32:36,107
just coming to you..automatically!
Just don't project your minds into it. Just

229
00:32:36,132 --> 00:32:43,099
you'll get answers to every question, just
like that. Because innocence in everyone is

230
00:32:43,163 --> 00:32:49,173
the simple answer where all the complications
drop out. The innocence is that. And that

231
00:32:49,173 --> 00:32:54,492
is what is the love of God, is the love of
God.

232
00:32:54,632 --> 00:33:00,913
So don't confuse this with love, with all
your nonsensical love ideas you have about

233
00:33:00,913 --> 00:33:07,913
people and identification, misidentification.
This is pure love within us, the purity, the

234
00:33:07,943 --> 00:33:16,098
innocence which is love and which is life
itself, we should say. It is a part of that,

235
00:33:16,123 --> 00:33:20,753
the Prana Shakti. But Prana Shakti is not
Mahalakshmi.

236
00:33:20,753 --> 00:33:29,062
So Mahalakshmi is the essence and essence
of everything, Because if creation has to

237
00:33:29,094 --> 00:33:35,413
take place, also, if desire of God is there,
and if there is no Mahalakshmi tattwa, then

238
00:33:35,413 --> 00:33:40,803
what is the use of having desire?
Supposing, even if you have creation, and

239
00:33:40,803 --> 00:33:45,859
you do not have the Mahalakshmi tattwa, how
will you work it out? You cannot work it out,

240
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,041
You have to have Mahalakshmi tattwa. Because
they do not have any meaning.

241
00:33:48,041 --> 00:33:54,952
So outwardly it is Mahalakshmi tattwa, but
inside, inside is, we can say, there are three

242
00:33:54,952 --> 00:34:01,654
cores. The first core is Mahalakshmi tattwa,
outside to look at, you see the growth, all

243
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:09,296
right. Then inside is the creation, that is
all the elements being created and all that.

244
00:34:09,358 --> 00:34:19,952
But inside that is the desire and inside the
desire is the half one, you can say, is the

245
00:34:19,977 --> 00:34:29,108
Ganesha. So this Ganesh tattwa ultimately
overpowers everything and permeates everything.

246
00:34:29,309 --> 00:34:38,905
And this is, I would say that, don't think
about it. Just allow your innocence to grow,

247
00:34:38,999 --> 00:34:45,440
Simple innocence.
And your dignity. That's very important to

248
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:52,440
have your dignity. Like some people think
if they wear torn clothes and walk about on

249
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:57,620
the street, and all they are big sanyasis.
It's wrong. Why? You are not being dignified

250
00:34:57,620 --> 00:35:02,759
and God has given you so much, why should
you try to show that you haven't got anything?

251
00:35:02,759 --> 00:35:08,600
Just to show off that you haven't got anything
God has given. This is just a sort of thanks-giving

252
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:15,310
to God that, "God you have given me so much."
You have to wear the best. Like in Puja, if

253
00:35:15,310 --> 00:35:21,320
you see, the ladies here wear all their nose
rings and all their ornaments and everything,

254
00:35:21,320 --> 00:35:25,980
in the temple if they have to go. Everything
they wear! And in the same way, men also wear

255
00:35:25,980 --> 00:35:30,310
their very clean dresses, very clean things,
whatever they have, they wear simple, clean

256
00:35:30,310 --> 00:35:37,310
dresses, whatever they have. But no ostentation.
It is just a thing by which you express. The

257
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:46,945
God has given you this. 'O God! I thank you'.
It is such a great day today to be, in the

258
00:35:46,970 --> 00:35:53,550
new year, on the new year day, to be here
on Mahalakshmi's place of Kolhapur. And this

259
00:35:53,550 --> 00:36:05,335
is also called Kolhapur because Kolhasura
was killed here. Kolhasura was a horrible

260
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:10,210
fellow like a fox and he was born again. Now
he is again dead. Thank God!

261
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:15,700
He was here and now he's...Kolhasura died.
You don't think about it, again your mind

262
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:19,120
goes out. Don't think about it, I will tell
you about it. I have deliberately avoided

263
00:36:19,120 --> 00:36:25,530
the name. He was born again and was pitched
out. So this is the place where Kolhasura

264
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:32,530
was killed, where this was established, so
Mahalakshmi incarnation came in and that is

265
00:36:32,890 --> 00:36:38,610
how this place has a special value, that we
have come here for a pilgrimage and let us

266
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:45,610
be in a humble way. Think about it.
Actually these things could not take place

267
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:50,980
in the West because even if they had come
out of the Mother Earth who would have recognised

268
00:36:50,980 --> 00:36:56,260
them? Who would have known about them? Who
would have respected them? Who would have

269
00:36:56,260 --> 00:37:05,656
worshipped them? That is why it did not happen
in the West too much. But it is there, little

270
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:15,905
bit is there, no doubt. But here now we have
these, all these, temples and the attack on

271
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:24,345
the innocence has come from tantrikas. And
so the tantrikas entered all these temples

272
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:29,530
and they tried to establish themselves. But
gradually they are being neutralised and cleaned

273
00:37:29,530 --> 00:37:35,440
out. These tantrikas have gone into every
temple of all the Goddesses. And they will

274
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,290
be gradually all out, straight out.
So this is the attack that came through and

275
00:37:40,290 --> 00:37:47,290
that how these brahmins came down and settled
in these places. So-called brahmins. And tried

276
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:55,234
to preach about all tantrik methods and things
here, in the temple, and they really spoiled

277
00:37:55,259 --> 00:38:01,953
the atmosphere here.
So may God bless you all.

278
00:38:01,978 --> 00:38:19,047
I want you people to develop concentration
of mind so that you rise above all other misidentifications

279
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:27,421
and get identified with the Pure Spirit, through
your Mahalakshmi principle.

280
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:30,046
May God bless you.
