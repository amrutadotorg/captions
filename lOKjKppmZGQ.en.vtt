GURU PUJA
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.040
1st August, 1999

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:25.730
Since we have come to Cabella, it is the ten
years completed.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:39.469
So you can imagine how, in these ten years,
we have been able to progress in Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:48.149
Now, today we are going to have a Guru Puja.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:58.180
As I have said, you all are gurus and you
want to worship Me as your Guru.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.239
It is all right.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:18.500
But the main thing one should understand,
that you have become guru, no doubt, because

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.280
you have the knowledge, you have the absolute
knowledge.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:30.720
And so we can say you have become gurus, no
doubt.

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:43.580
But one has to understand that you have reached
a state where you can raise the Kundalini,

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.290
you can give Realization to others.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.730
Also you know what is the absolute knowledge.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:09.179
To know the absolute knowledge is very important,
and to assimilate is even much more important.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.300
Though we know the absolute knowledge, we
cannot assimilate it that well.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.410
That means we cannot go deep into it.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:23.500
What is the reason for that?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:38.209
We have to realize that we have all come out
of the heritage that was the animal kingdom.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.659
From the animal kingdom you have evolved.

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:58.079
So there are so many things of the animal
heritage that linger in us: the aggressiveness,

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:12.010
the domination, peevishness, fear, grabbing.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:21.874
All these are our inheritance, and they are
within us lingering.

00:03:21.874 --> 00:03:29.299
We want to grab things of others’ - not
you people, of course not, but people who

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:32.349
are not yet in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:48.389
They first used to grab lands, then they started
grabbing people, making them slaves.

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:57.749
Then they were not satisfied with that, so
they were grabbing kingdoms, jewelry and all

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:00.540
these things.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.620
So just to grab.

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:09.870
They have no legal right, still they would
grab.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:22.780
It seems, it seems very funny, it seems very
inhuman, but it is there because of our inheritance.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:29.440
Now there are so many other things, like jealousy.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:37.530
Among animals there is very little of that,
they don't have jealousies so much as we have;

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:47.340
while we have inherited this jealousy by our
own reactions and thinking.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:55.040
People get jealous and they want to put down
others.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:04.060
If they cannot achieve any height, they want
to bring down the heights of others.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:10.921
This kind of jealousy, when it grabs human
beings, they think whatever is done in the

00:05:10.921 --> 00:05:14.260
name of jealousy is all right.

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:21.540
They become very conscious that “We are
lower than another person.

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:31.400
We lack in some talents than another person,”
and they try to overpower that person, because

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:37.460
of the force of jealousy behind them.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:48.250
Now the trouble is, though we are human beings,
we have inherited so many animal qualities,

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:56.500
like we are ferocious, we are angry and we
get upset, as animals do.

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:06.920
But additional to that, human beings can react
because of their thinking.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.420
They think.

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:19.000
They can think, and by thinking, all these
inherited properties become perverted.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:24.490
Like a person wants to put down another person.

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:32.520
Then he doesn’t behave like an animal, in
a straightforward way, but he will find out

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:40.530
a device, a method, he’ll think it over
how to do it.

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:54.810
The main problem with human beings is that
they still have inherited very violent temper.

00:06:54.810 --> 00:07:01.550
This violent temper has to be controlled,
has to be seen.

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:08.120
When you see something which you don't like,
which is against your will, it may be something

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:11.630
like that, immediately you flare up.

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:21.629
Just now I saw, instead of the camphor, they
had put a sugar candy.

00:07:21.629 --> 00:07:31.240
To sugar candy they were putting the matchbox,
you see, they were using a match into it,

00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:32.240
matchstick.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.610
It would not take the fire.

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.330
They tried and tried, it would not.

00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:39.260
So I said, "Let Me see what is that."

00:07:39.260 --> 00:07:42.280
So that was a sugar candy.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.370
If it was camphor, it would just flare up.

00:07:47.370 --> 00:07:51.530
So the quality of the person is known in the
same way.

00:07:51.530 --> 00:07:58.600
If with the slightest provocation, if he gets
into temper and gets annoyed, then his quality

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:02.770
is not very good as a guru.

00:08:02.770 --> 00:08:15.610
As a guru we should not flare up, we should
not get angry, we should not try to oppress

00:08:15.610 --> 00:08:16.610
others.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:19.450
"But what can we do, then?"

00:08:19.450 --> 00:08:21.720
people will ask.

00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:28.940
We have another method, what we call is love.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.990
Love.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:41.340
Instead of getting angry, if you show love
and compassion to that person, so what happens

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:50.860
that it doesn’t give you any anger, and
the another person, you don't make him angry

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:51.860
also.

00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.910
Anger begets anger.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:09:02.860
If you get angry with somebody, that person
may not retort because he is afraid of you,

00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:09.110
it may be that; but in his heart he will keep
a revenge in his mind that “One day I will

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:10.110
show him.

00:09:10.110 --> 00:09:12.330
Why should he get angry with me?”

00:09:12.330 --> 00:09:21.120
So in Sahaja Yoga, please remember that love
is the only way we can solve the problem.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:28.990
Now if something goes wrong, say, in the ashram,
if you get angry with that person, what will

00:09:28.990 --> 00:09:30.010
happen?

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.890
That person will bear a grudge against you,
perhaps.

00:09:33.890 --> 00:09:38.160
If he’s a good Sahaja Yogi, he may realize
that it was a wrong thing to do.

00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:47.680
But if he’s a bad Sahaja Yogi, not yet fully
equipped to understand, then what he will

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.680
do?

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:56.850
He will just feel that “This man has insulted
me.

00:09:56.850 --> 00:10:06.760
He has deliberately put me down and all that,
and I should try to take a revenge.”

00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:14.490
Among animals this activity is very limited.

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:20.000
I don't think they believe in revenge, except
for a few animals.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:30.740
They say that if you hurt a snake, it will
take its respite, it will come back on you,

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.620
that's what is said.

00:10:33.620 --> 00:10:38.760
And this one is something, one quality of
the snake.

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:47.310
But as we have passed through all these different
categories, we might be having some of the

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:54.920
qualities of some of these animals within
us, we may be even snakes anywhere.

00:10:54.920 --> 00:11:02.650
If the snake is within us, then anybody who
hurts you, you’ll remember it all your life.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:08.680
“He has hurt me, so I’ll put him right
one day, I’ll take a revenge!”

00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.060
If there’s a snake within us.

00:11:11.060 --> 00:11:18.920
But now if there's a tiger within you, so
you’ll become very ferocious, at the smallest

00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:24.000
thing you'll get angry, lose temper.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:36.660
Now, this is not a very good situation, that
we are still at the level of animals and our

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:40.330
inheritance is still working in us.

00:11:40.330 --> 00:11:42.400
So we have to keep a watch.

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:53.610
We have to be good gurus, and for a good guru,
you have to have a very peaceful, compassionate,

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:56.630
loving temperament.

00:11:56.630 --> 00:12:18.050
After all, one has to understand that people
have this inheritance, and some people have

00:12:18.050 --> 00:12:21.649
more, or some people have this, or some people
have that.

00:12:21.649 --> 00:12:32.560
For that, if you get angry with that person,
it’s not going to help him or help you.

00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:39.580
But if you are loving and compassionate and
you explain that person what is the problem

00:12:39.580 --> 00:12:45.950
is and what you want to do, I tell you it
will improve, he’ll definitely improve and

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.270
he’ll feel your love.

00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:57.030
Of course sometimes, sometimes it’s necessary
to also forgive such a person.

00:12:57.030 --> 00:13:01.160
Such a person is to be forgiven, absolutely.

00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:07.370
In that it doesn’t mean that if he has done
wrongs, all kinds of wrongs, you forgive him

00:13:07.370 --> 00:13:12.860
and he goes on still with the same, doesn't
mean that.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:14.680
“Forgiven” means “forgotten.”

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:21.370
Such and such person has been misbehaving,
so just forget, forget it, completely forget

00:13:21.370 --> 00:13:22.370
it.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:23.813
For a guru it is important, for a Sahaja Yogi
guru.

00:13:23.813 --> 00:13:35.630
I must say others gurus were not like that,
they were absolutely, I would say, extremely

00:13:35.630 --> 00:13:42.709
hot-tempered, and they used to lose temper
on people.

00:13:42.709 --> 00:13:50.240
Once I met a guru and he told Me, “Mother,
You are too kind to them.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.279
And with this kindness You cannot create good
people.

00:13:53.279 --> 00:13:56.390
I’ve had enough of it,” he said.

00:13:56.390 --> 00:14:05.690
“I had made two people into gurus, and one
of them got lost in the money.”

00:14:05.690 --> 00:14:08.310
“All right, what happened to the second?”

00:14:08.310 --> 00:14:12.440
“And second one got lost in the women.”

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:17.760
So I said, ”Now it's all right.

00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:23.590
If they are lost, they are lost, but if you
can revive them with your love, affection

00:14:23.590 --> 00:14:27.690
and kindness, better get around them.”

00:14:27.690 --> 00:15:52.310
So the one who was lost… [interruption]

00:15:52.310 --> 00:16:15.850
So as a guru, you must conclude that they
are still lingering with their inheritance.

00:16:15.850 --> 00:16:22.870
But the second problem is much worse, because
human beings can think.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:29.430
Of course animals also think, but it is always
conditioning.

00:16:29.430 --> 00:16:33.790
Whatever conditioning they have, accordingly
they behave.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:41.089
But they don't have ego, that kind as human
beings have developed.

00:16:41.089 --> 00:16:46.600
So the gurus develop also a very bad ego.

00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:55.649
The first ego is, other gurus I have seen,
they told Me that “We have done so much,

00:16:55.649 --> 00:17:03.450
we have worked so hard to achieve this state,
and why should we give Realizations to others?”

00:17:03.450 --> 00:17:13.059
Or if they have got Realization, then, “What
have they done?

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:15.079
Why should they get Realization?”

00:17:15.079 --> 00:17:23.679
It’s become a comparison between their own
state and how they have achieved it, and how

00:17:23.679 --> 00:17:26.809
others have to achieve it.

00:17:26.809 --> 00:17:36.910
So they make all kinds of different torturing,
troubling maneuvres.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:53.030
For example, they may make the disciple stand
on his head, give his family up, do this,

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:54.310
do that.

00:17:54.310 --> 00:17:57.750
They’ll beat them, they can beat also.

00:17:57.750 --> 00:18:07.430
They will make him stay in the water for a
long time, make him stand under, on one feet.

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:22.200
Like this they punish, and the worst comes
to worst, they may beat with sticks or with

00:18:22.200 --> 00:18:23.200
stones.

00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.410
They’re like that.

00:18:25.410 --> 00:18:31.730
They don't want to talk, they don't want to
understand what the another person has to

00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:40.900
say, or the ones who are seekers, how they
should be treated.

00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:47.850
All this anger and all these things might
have been all right before, but after the

00:18:47.850 --> 00:18:51.110
advent of Sahaja Yoga you must know it is
not necessary.

00:18:51.110 --> 00:19:01.640
It is not at all necessary to give any physical
punishment to your disciples.

00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.850
Now also the mental punishment to your disciple
should not be given.

00:19:07.850 --> 00:19:15.380
Like people start saying all kinds of things
to their disciple; like saying they, I am

00:19:15.380 --> 00:19:22.900
saying, say there is a leader, and the leader
finds something wrong with the disciple, then

00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:27.470
he goes on saying, “Now you are like this,
your father was like this, your grandfather

00:19:27.470 --> 00:19:32.600
was like this, your great- grandfather was
like this, and you are also like this.”

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:36.380
Or some sort of thing that will hurt him.

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.900
By hurting a person, you are not going to
help.

00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:46.070
Supposing while walking you are hurt, you
can't walk.

00:19:46.070 --> 00:19:54.320
In your spiritual ascent also if you are hurt,
you cannot go ahead.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.620
So not to hurt people is very important.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:06.090
Once you go on hurting others, then you are
not a good guru, you are not a one who is

00:20:06.090 --> 00:20:12.510
really being kind and understanding of the
disciple.

00:20:12.510 --> 00:20:20.900
In Sahaja Yoga it's a different thing altogether,
because you all have achieved Sahaja Yoga

00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:28.910
without doing any kind of penance, any kind
of a guilty consciousness, confessions, anything.

00:20:28.910 --> 00:20:29.910
Nothing!

00:20:29.910 --> 00:20:37.669
As you are, you got your Realization.

00:20:37.669 --> 00:20:42.390
Nobody had to stand on their heads, give up
their husbands, wives, their families, this

00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:44.820
thing - nothing of the kind.

00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:51.309
As you are, whatever dress you are wearing,
whatever conditions you are, you are given

00:20:51.309 --> 00:20:56.230
Realization - it’s a fact.

00:20:56.230 --> 00:21:02.970
You don't have to pay for it, you don't have
to exert yourself, don't have to do anything.

00:21:02.970 --> 00:21:08.610
Just you get it, sitting down wherever you
are.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:17.310
After that, this kind of a happening should
prove to you that you have a power of love,

00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:19.160
of compassion.

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.350
Out of your love you have given Realization.

00:21:22.350 --> 00:21:24.290
We never realize that.

00:21:24.290 --> 00:21:29.460
Supposing we are anxious to give Realization
to people, we want to go to the villages,

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:32.210
work there and give them Realization.

00:21:32.210 --> 00:21:33.210
Why?

00:21:33.210 --> 00:21:35.490
Why do we do it?

00:21:35.490 --> 00:21:43.020
It is not for any fame, not for any reward
or anything, but just out of the love that

00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:47.900
is within your heart that you feel, “Why
am I enjoying everything?

00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:49.679
Why others are not enjoying?”

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:59.420
And so you go out of the way to help people
to get their Realization.

00:21:59.420 --> 00:22:05.049
Now you have become a greater human being,
and you feel concern.

00:22:05.049 --> 00:22:10.600
Others are getting ruined, they are going
on the wrong path, they are doing wrong things;

00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:20.110
and that makes you feel very, very upset,
and you want to help them.

00:22:20.110 --> 00:22:27.250
And this understanding once you have, then
you will know how to deal with the person

00:22:27.250 --> 00:22:33.980
with whom you have to behave like a guru.

00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:39.820
Mostly it is not necessary to say anything
harsh to that person.

00:22:39.820 --> 00:22:47.690
At the most you can tell the mistakes that
they have committed, but that too in a, such

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:59.750
a soft manner that a person doesn’t get
any shock out of that.

00:22:59.750 --> 00:23:10.491
All this thing of attachments also: now somebody
has too much attachment, say, for the family,

00:23:10.491 --> 00:23:16.450
for the wife, for the children or someone.

00:23:16.450 --> 00:23:23.730
And once they come to Sahaj Yoga, still they
have same amount of attachment.

00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.100
All right, doesn’t matter.

00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:34.720
But how far they will go with that attachment,
how long it will continue is the point.

00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.380
You should be detached.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:45.400
If I say, you cannot be; it's a state, it's
a state of mind when you are detached.

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:52.340
But when it comes to doing something for them,
you will go all out to help them.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:55.929
But you are not a attached person.

00:23:55.929 --> 00:24:01.620
Now what is the description of an attached
person?

00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:09.370
Attached person is always worried about the
other person, goes on thinking about the other

00:24:09.370 --> 00:24:15.820
person, cannot think of Sahaja Yoga, only
think of the people with whom he is attached.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:23.530
Then he is very sensitive, you can't say anything
to his brother, sister or anyone, otherwise

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:25.070
he jumps.

00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:30.880
Attachment is also with the name that he has.

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:39.320
Supposing he has achieved a certain name,
supposing, or some big position, then what

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.010
does he do?

00:24:41.010 --> 00:24:50.440
You can't challenge him any way, you cannot
by any words you can challenge him, because

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:52.440
he’s so identified with that.

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:59.920
He thinks he’s a big person who has achieved
such a lot of positions in life.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:12.950
He’s so much attached that he wants also
the guru to pay respect to that attachment.

00:25:12.950 --> 00:25:25.870
Now which is the way you can solve that problem?

00:25:25.870 --> 00:25:36.350
Supposing somebody is very much attached to
his wife, say for example, then you should

00:25:36.350 --> 00:25:42.700
not discuss and argue with that person, not
at all, because he’s still coming up slowly,

00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.570
slowly up to this stage.

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:53.240
Such a person is not absolutely a perfect
Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:54.970
So what do you have to do?

00:25:54.970 --> 00:26:01.230
If he’s attached to his wife, let it be.

00:26:01.230 --> 00:26:10.280
But the Divine will work it out, and he will
realize that what he has been thinking, doing

00:26:10.280 --> 00:26:15.860
and taking decisions is all wrong.

00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.309
And once he discovered it himself, then he
will get detached.

00:26:21.309 --> 00:26:27.770
But if you go on telling him anything and
try to argue it out, it will never work out.

00:26:27.770 --> 00:26:36.830
So you must understand that as human beings,
whatever we were, also as Sahaja Yogis, we

00:26:36.830 --> 00:26:38.080
have problems.

00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:47.410
And these should be slowly, slowly should
be dissolved; not by argument, not by saying

00:26:47.410 --> 00:26:51.370
things, but by love and compassion.

00:26:51.370 --> 00:27:02.490
If you have love for a person, you will be
amazed, ninety-nine percent people value love.

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:09.120
This is the third quality of human beings,
I should say.

00:27:09.120 --> 00:27:17.320
First is his inheritance, second is, he thinks,
and thirdly that he values love.

00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:26.669
Anybody who loves, the another person values
that love, because he thinks that “This

00:27:26.669 --> 00:27:35.590
particular person is loving me; not my wealth,
not my beauty, not my this thing, but he is

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:38.000
loving me.”

00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:49.230
And this idea of love, this is something that
will get him completely detached from that

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:50.230
person, easily.

00:27:50.230 --> 00:27:51.230
How?

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:59.430
Now it looks very funny that if you like somebody,
if you love somebody, and then you should

00:27:59.430 --> 00:28:01.240
get detached.

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:05.539
It’s only possible in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:05.539 --> 00:28:19.320
In Sahaja Yoga your state of mind is such
that you are absolutely detached and absolutely

00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.220
attached.

00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:23.130
How?

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:38.289
For example now, say I have My daughter, so
I’m detached, I never telephone to her,

00:28:38.289 --> 00:28:45.260
I am never bothered about her; because in
Sahaja Yoga, you know how is that person.

00:28:45.260 --> 00:28:49.110
If the vibrations are right, why should you
telephone?

00:28:49.110 --> 00:28:50.970
Why should you talk to her?

00:28:50.970 --> 00:28:52.730
Why should you ask for anything?

00:28:52.730 --> 00:28:53.730
No need.

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:58.080
Only on vibrations you'll know how the person
is.

00:28:58.080 --> 00:29:01.669
And so it will seem that you are absolutely
detached.

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:09.480
But when you will find the vibrations are
showing or are indicating something serious

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:19.720
about that person, what you will do, you'll
put full attention to that, full attention.

00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:25.890
You put attention, but not attachment.

00:29:25.890 --> 00:29:29.450
So the attachment doesn’t solve the problem.

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:33.080
What solves the problem is attention.

00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:40.910
But when you are not detached, then your attention
is attached attention.

00:29:40.910 --> 00:29:50.510
It's an attention that is not available to
everyone, an attention that gets stuck, absolutely

00:29:50.510 --> 00:29:55.890
stuck into that person with whom you are identified.

00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:57.669
Try to understand.

00:29:57.669 --> 00:30:06.500
So to be identified with someone is not actually,
what we can say, paying attention to that

00:30:06.500 --> 00:30:09.900
person.

00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:11.180
And then your attention will work.

00:30:11.180 --> 00:30:19.130
If you are of that level, whenever you put
attention to that particular person who needs

00:30:19.130 --> 00:30:21.549
your attention, it will work.

00:30:21.549 --> 00:30:27.590
But if you are all the time wasting your attention
on a person because you’re attached to that

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:35.020
person, your attention will be tired, it won't
work out.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:44.059
It's a big, I should say, a paradox, that
if you are attached to someone, then your

00:30:44.059 --> 00:30:47.340
attention doesn’t work.

00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:49.720
And if you are not attached to that person…

00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:53.350
You do everything else: now you have to give
lecture, all right, I’m giving lecture;

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:58.210
then I have to do some cooking, I'll do cooking;
this, that, that and that.

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:03.620
But all the time if you are thinking about
that person, all the time you want to have

00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:09.200
connection with that person - it’s not necessary.

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:11.559
That person is all right.

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:13.840
What is there to be so much worried about
that person?

00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:18.170
After all, you have to do Sahaja Yoga, you
have to do so many things, you have to raise

00:31:18.170 --> 00:31:20.050
Kundalini of so many.

00:31:20.050 --> 00:31:26.419
Now you are getting attached to one person
somewhere, it's not a very good thing.

00:31:26.419 --> 00:31:35.470
By that kind of attachment your attention
also becomes useless, absolutely useless.

00:31:35.470 --> 00:31:39.039
So let the attention be free.

00:31:39.039 --> 00:31:46.610
Attention should not be bound by your attachments.

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:57.230
Attention should be absolutely free, so it
works automatically, automatically, and you

00:31:57.230 --> 00:32:04.929
will be amazed, even if you do not pay attention,
the attention will work it.

00:32:04.929 --> 00:32:13.330
It is such a big thing to have this spiritual
attention, which is nothing but love.

00:32:13.330 --> 00:32:15.242
It will just act.

00:32:15.242 --> 00:32:18.770
You'll be amazed how it acts.

00:32:18.770 --> 00:32:27.040
It's another world I am talking about, not
this mundane world but something higher, where

00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:34.020
your attention works, and works so beautifully
that you are amazed how it has worked.

00:32:34.020 --> 00:32:38.910
But you should not bound it by your attachments.

00:32:38.910 --> 00:32:44.450
If it is bound you can have a very limited
sphere, only the people who are attached to

00:32:44.450 --> 00:32:49.060
you, or you are attached to those persons.

00:32:49.060 --> 00:33:02.860
That's why identification is not the way a
guru should work it out.

00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:11.029
Now there are ten disciples and one guru,
and the guru likes only one.

00:33:11.029 --> 00:33:17.970
He thinks this is he is the best, and he should
be encouraged and he should be given all the

00:33:17.970 --> 00:33:19.380
possible help.

00:33:19.380 --> 00:33:23.779
But that’s not going to help.

00:33:23.779 --> 00:33:28.820
But on the contrary, he should say, “This
is already a good fellow.

00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:32.740
He has risen already very high, he has gone
very deep.”

00:33:32.740 --> 00:33:38.950
So pay attention to those who are not so good,
and talk to them about it that “You have

00:33:38.950 --> 00:33:43.350
to come up,” in a very sweet manner.

00:33:43.350 --> 00:33:51.490
You have to talk to these other people who
are not yet there, or who are still struggling.

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:55.450
You have to understand them.

00:33:55.450 --> 00:34:00.830
You have to notice, what are they doing?

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:08.540
Why is it they are not improving or rising
in their attention?

00:34:08.540 --> 00:34:14.330
What is the problem, why the Divine is not
flowing through them?

00:34:14.330 --> 00:34:21.320
And you'll find the reason for this is that
people do not have good attention, is because

00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:24.619
it is focused on someone all the time.

00:34:24.619 --> 00:34:31.150
They feel that this is their responsibility,
that it should be focused.

00:34:31.150 --> 00:34:39.120
It's just to give, it's an explanation, it's
just a explanation to say that “You see,

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:44.089
naturally I have to be worried about this,
and worried about that.”

00:34:44.089 --> 00:34:47.490
It's just an explanation.

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:56.599
But if you really don't fix your attention
to one person or ten persons only, then your

00:34:56.599 --> 00:35:02.200
attention looks after the whole world.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:14.320
It receives all the information, and also
it gives all the information what is to be

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:20.180
done to correct the situation.

00:35:20.180 --> 00:35:28.800
So one has to rise into that state where you
do not get angry, annoyed, upset - no, not

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:30.290
at all.

00:35:30.290 --> 00:35:41.330
What happens to you, that you see a situation,
and in that you are not involved.

00:35:41.330 --> 00:35:47.620
You see the situation and you are away from
it.

00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:51.900
Then you can solve that problem better.

00:35:51.900 --> 00:35:57.560
But if you are part and parcel of that problem,
then you cannot solve.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:36:11.720
It's like this I was telling, that those who
are fighting, say, cannot solve the problem,

00:36:11.720 --> 00:36:19.470
but a person who is not fighting can solve
the problem.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:31.730
So it’s a very simple thing to understand
that if you are identified, if you are involved

00:36:31.730 --> 00:36:42.730
with one person or with one kind of a thing,
then you are lost.

00:36:42.730 --> 00:36:52.230
So our attention has to be always free and
can be applied widely, wherever needed.

00:36:52.230 --> 00:36:54.360
That is the state one has to reach.

00:36:54.360 --> 00:37:01.330
If you reach that state of mind, it's not
I am saying you can do anything about it,

00:37:01.330 --> 00:37:03.210
it’s just a state of mind.

00:37:03.210 --> 00:37:07.349
Now, how do we do that?

00:37:07.349 --> 00:37:12.930
Only through introspection.

00:37:12.930 --> 00:37:23.800
Through introspection you will understand
that you need help to solve your problems.

00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:34.190
Firstly the problem is how to face yourself,
because you are a little bit shy or maybe

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:35.620
nervous about it.

00:37:35.620 --> 00:37:48.830
As the time comes, you'd be amazed that this
nervousness has no meaning at all.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:38:02.680
When you try to be deliberate about it, then
it won't work out; but if you are Sahaja,

00:38:02.680 --> 00:38:04.070
it will work out.

00:38:04.070 --> 00:38:11.950
So we come to the second point, apart from
the attention, that we should leave everything

00:38:11.950 --> 00:38:16.589
into the hands of Paramchaitanya.

00:38:16.589 --> 00:38:19.200
Let the Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.180
“This is the problem?

00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.040
Let Paramchaitanya solve the problem.

00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:26.540
We are not bothered.”

00:38:26.540 --> 00:38:29.220
So a detachment comes in.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:37.410
You give the whole thing to Paramchaitanya
to solve, so you are not in it, you are away

00:38:37.410 --> 00:38:38.410
from it.

00:38:38.410 --> 00:38:47.380
Very, very simple things are there, that if
you understand that we suffer, because everybody

00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:51.640
feels responsible for us.

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:57.930
Everybody thinks they are responsible, they
have to do this responsibility for us, somebody

00:38:57.930 --> 00:39:01.960
says this responsibility he has to do.

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:08.780
All these things are worrying them, and that
is the reason today we have a very complex

00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:10.770
society.

00:39:10.770 --> 00:39:18.900
They are suffering from all kinds of diseases
in which only thinking is responsible.

00:39:18.900 --> 00:39:26.030
By this thinking all the time, thinking about
one person, thinking about one problem, you

00:39:26.030 --> 00:39:28.000
reach nowhere.

00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:33.349
At that moment, what you have to do is to
leave it to the Paramchaitanya.

00:39:33.349 --> 00:39:48.730
If it goes to the Paramchaitanya, It will
manage, It will solve the problem.

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:52.430
Now I will tell you one thing, an experience.

00:39:52.430 --> 00:39:54.730
This time I was in America.

00:39:54.730 --> 00:39:56.550
I wanted to have a puja there.

00:39:56.550 --> 00:40:00.610
So I said, "All right, let them come for the
puja.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:04.630
It's nice if they want to come."

00:40:04.630 --> 00:40:08.770
Then they told Me that "Mother, we want to
bring presents for You for the puja.

00:40:08.770 --> 00:40:11.460
So how can we bring the presents?"

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.829
I said, "It's very simple.

00:40:13.829 --> 00:40:15.630
Don't bring!"

00:40:15.630 --> 00:40:17.690
But they wouldn't listen to that.

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:25.460
They said, "We'll have to bring, and the Customs
will trouble us and do this and do that."

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:34.270
So there was only one building ahead was,
there was another building where they were

00:40:34.270 --> 00:40:36.750
having a liquidation sale.

00:40:36.750 --> 00:40:39.460
I said, "This is something nice!

00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:41.780
One can have a look at it."

00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:50.200
So I went in and I found things so cheap,
unbelievable, very, very expensive things

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:52.390
for throw-away prices.

00:40:52.390 --> 00:40:54.770
I was amazed how it is there.

00:40:54.770 --> 00:40:57.460
So I told them, "I can purchase all these
things.

00:40:57.460 --> 00:41:02.420
I'll pay you, but you bring all these things
to Canajoharie."

00:41:02.420 --> 00:41:06.839
They agreed, “All right, we’ll bring this
to Canajoharie.”

00:41:06.839 --> 00:41:11.990
And they brought all the things all packed
nicely and gave it to Sahaja Yogis.

00:41:11.990 --> 00:41:19.300
We had no problem of Customs or anything;
I paid them there.

00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:38.859
How, you see, things can be improved by understanding
what is the most important thing: is to love.

00:41:38.859 --> 00:41:44.110
But love is truth, and truth is love.

00:41:44.110 --> 00:41:55.690
If you have love for somebody, genuine love,
then anything you want to do with that person

00:41:55.690 --> 00:42:03.470
will be absolutely obvious, because it will
be truthful.

00:42:03.470 --> 00:42:08.971
Anything you say to such a person will be
absolutely obvious, clear-cut, because it

00:42:08.971 --> 00:42:12.700
is absolutely truthful.

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:19.530
So when you are dealing with somebody also,
you should be extremely truthful.

00:42:19.530 --> 00:42:29.500
Of course, you need not say things that will
hurt him, but you must use such ways and methods

00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:39.420
that will not in any way hurt the other person,
which will have an effect on that person.

00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:45.640
So this kind of a gurus we need now very much
in Sahaja Yoga, because by Sahaja Yoga has

00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:47.860
spread a lot.

00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:55.040
So first of all, our temper has to be brought
into proper shape.

00:42:55.040 --> 00:43:02.940
A guru has no business, I mean the Sahaja
Yogi guru has no business to lose temper at

00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:06.170
all, on any point whatsoever.

00:43:06.170 --> 00:43:18.170
If they can really do that much, it will save
our, I mean, so much of worry, so much of

00:43:18.170 --> 00:43:22.270
problem, so much of mess we create.

00:43:22.270 --> 00:43:26.310
All this can be solved very easily.

00:43:26.310 --> 00:43:34.530
But first we must have pure love in our heart,
not love out of some gain or out of some sort

00:43:34.530 --> 00:43:42.170
of reward, but pure love if we have, then
we can work it out very easily, anything that

00:43:42.170 --> 00:43:44.520
you want to do.

00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:51.460
This is a very lengthy thing which can go
on forever.

00:43:51.460 --> 00:44:00.310
Because, after all, the gurus have to know
what are their duties and why they are gurus,

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:07.430
it’s very important, very important position
that they are gurus.

00:44:07.430 --> 00:44:17.579
And they should use that position for exhibiting
tremendous understanding of their disciple,

00:44:17.579 --> 00:44:24.390
and also their purpose should be clear-cut.

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:32.260
People should not doubt him, should not think,
why he is doing such and such things?

00:44:32.260 --> 00:44:40.550
It should not be a mystery, it should be absolutely
clear-cut.

00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:49.920
All these things I am telling you today, because
today we have completed ten, our ten years

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.560
of stay in Cabella.

00:44:51.560 --> 00:44:55.790
Cabella has been extremely kind to Me.

00:44:55.790 --> 00:45:03.510
They have brought lots of people to Sahaja
Yoga, I tell you, very lots of people.

00:45:03.510 --> 00:45:08.210
It is a very far-fetched place, everybody
discarded it and said, "Where are You going

00:45:08.210 --> 00:45:10.700
to live?" and all that.

00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:19.660
But here only it has worked, and that should
be accepted as a very good indication that

00:45:19.660 --> 00:45:29.859
Sahaja Yoga does miraculous things, miraculous.

00:45:29.859 --> 00:45:36.020
But the foremost thing is, you must know vibrations.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:40.020
If you don't know about vibrations, then you
can't do it.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:44.660
For example, when I first came to Cabella,
everybody told Me, “Mother, very lonely

00:45:44.660 --> 00:45:46.470
place, there are mafias around.

00:45:46.470 --> 00:45:47.470
Only six, seven houses there.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:48.470
Where are You going?

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:49.740
What is this?”

00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.450
They all warned Me.

00:45:51.450 --> 00:46:00.200
So I came here, and immediately I told the
Mayor, “I am going to buy it, and tomorrow

00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:02.270
I'll pay you the money.”

00:46:02.270 --> 00:46:08.359
He was surprised: how can I do that?

00:46:08.359 --> 00:46:11.400
I said, "Don't worry!

00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.690
Perfectly all right."

00:46:13.690 --> 00:46:16.270
On vibrations it was.

00:46:16.270 --> 00:46:24.670
On vibrations I decided that this is a wonderful
place.

00:46:24.670 --> 00:46:28.810
And vibrations helped Me so much that time,
though everybody discouraged Me and everybody

00:46:28.810 --> 00:46:32.650
gave Me a very big picture, horrible one.

00:46:32.650 --> 00:46:38.230
But still, where is the mafia now?

00:46:38.230 --> 00:46:41.040
Gone, finished.

00:46:41.040 --> 00:46:54.890
Now, to know about a thing, you have to meditate
and improve your vision, which should be clear-cut.

00:46:54.890 --> 00:47:04.200
It should not be something, a vision which
is reflecting your particular ideas about

00:47:04.200 --> 00:47:10.820
a particular thing, but it should be a vision
which should be clear-cut.

00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:22.750
With Sahaja Yoga, one has to know the protection
of the Goddess is on top of your head.

00:47:22.750 --> 00:47:30.770
Nothing can go wrong with you, nothing will
happen to you, it will all work out.

00:47:30.770 --> 00:47:37.690
I am sure you will get yourself this experience.

00:47:37.690 --> 00:47:46.760
You see, talking about Sahaja Yoga like this
you just get meditative, you just get meditative,

00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:54.260
and you feel that one day all of you should
become like that - just meditative.

00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:59.980
And this meditative temperament or whatever
is the state, emits vibrations.

00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:09.470
It emits and creates path for you, for your
work, for your life, for everything.

00:48:09.470 --> 00:48:14.270
You don't have to struggle with anyone, you
don't have to fight with anyone, you don't

00:48:14.270 --> 00:48:16.710
have to argue with anyone.

00:48:16.710 --> 00:48:26.450
Just try to meditate, and achieve a state
which I’m describing to you, where you get

00:48:26.450 --> 00:48:37.670
completely surrounded by love and affection.

00:48:37.670 --> 00:48:47.010
May God bless you all.

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:56.369
There's one thing is important to understand,
that you should not go to extremes of everything,

00:48:56.369 --> 00:48:59.160
which is also a human quality.

00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:05.720
For example, if they are rational, they go
on rationalizing everything, “I can't do

00:49:05.720 --> 00:49:08.640
this, I can't do that.”

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.940
Something like that goes on.

00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:17.010
The second part of it is that they become
very emotional, and they become so emotional

00:49:17.010 --> 00:49:23.400
that they start doing wrong things in the
name of emotionality.

00:49:23.400 --> 00:49:25.520
You have to overcome these two things.

00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:29.170
If you have not overcome that, what's the
use?

00:49:29.170 --> 00:49:32.730
What’s the use of calling yourself Sahaja
Yogis?

00:49:32.730 --> 00:49:35.849
Minimum of minimum, this much you must do.

00:49:35.849 --> 00:49:39.640
Going to the extremes must be avoided.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:41.589
Keep a watch upon yourself.

00:49:41.589 --> 00:49:47.260
If you are going to the extremes, nothing
will work out; you might develop cancer, may

00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:50.730
develop horrible diseases on one side.

00:49:50.730 --> 00:49:57.640
And on the other side you might become a very
rational person, and no Sahaja Yoga will enter

00:49:57.640 --> 00:49:58.820
your head.

00:49:58.820 --> 00:50:05.410
So you have to keep the balance all the time.

00:50:05.410 --> 00:50:12.200
And with that balance, like somebody is a
Sahaja Yogini and she has done something very

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.260
wrong, then you should not become emotionally
attached, “Oh, Mother, what is it?

00:50:16.260 --> 00:50:19.300
And we should forgive her.”

00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:20.300
No!

00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:30.010
You tell her that “You must improve your
vibrations, and must come to a balance.

00:50:30.010 --> 00:50:35.260
And once you are in balance, then I will consider
your case.

00:50:35.260 --> 00:50:40.710
Then I will say it is so or not.”

00:50:40.710 --> 00:50:48.170
But if she has no balance, she goes into rationality,
she goes into emotional thing, and this emotional

00:50:48.170 --> 00:50:54.670
business can take you to any nonsensical thing,
as it is a psychological case.

00:50:54.670 --> 00:50:59.760
And one can go into very, very wrong things
that they are doing, out of this emotional

00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:09.210
thing, you see, like even singing songs that
are neurotic or anything, you see.

00:51:09.210 --> 00:51:12.710
All this emotional thing can take you anywhere.

00:51:12.710 --> 00:51:14.859
So to be emotional is not needed.

00:51:14.859 --> 00:51:17.660
You must love.

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:23.829
And left side is what you can call another
extreme.

00:51:23.829 --> 00:51:30.210
One side is, is this emotional, another is
rational.

00:51:30.210 --> 00:51:35.020
In rationality you can start justifying anything,
like Hitler did.

00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:39.210
He said, “No, this was right, I was doing
was right.”

00:51:39.210 --> 00:51:41.940
He took something into his head and now, “This
is right.”

00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:44.080
This is rationality.

00:51:44.080 --> 00:51:50.210
So both things are to be properly balanced,
and you should see that whatever you are doing

00:51:50.210 --> 00:51:57.589
are giving you a proper result.

00:51:57.589 --> 00:52:01.420
So thank you very much again and again.

00:52:01.420 --> 00:52:09.400
May God bless you.

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:17.390
May God bless you.
