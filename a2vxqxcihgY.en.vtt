00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.558
So Lakshmi is born out of the Guru principle.

00:00:16.494 --> 00:00:21.397
And this Guru principle starts working in you,

00:00:21.517 --> 00:00:26.006
when you have this Lakshmi principle awakened.

00:00:26.126 --> 00:00:30.637
Not money, I’m not saying money. Is the Lakshmi principle

00:00:31.406 --> 00:00:33.004
when you start thinking,

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:37.675
“What sweet thing I should give to another?”

00:00:41.713 --> 00:00:45.862
When you start thinking, “What should I do for others?”

00:00:48.156 --> 00:00:57.761
You have to be extremely
sweet, soft, not dry, not dry people.

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:04.857
“How to express my love?”

00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:10.767
So first thing is, as the sea spreads its wings

00:01:10.887 --> 00:01:16.071
and says, “All right, let the sun take away my water,

00:01:16.191 --> 00:01:22.386
let me boil, let it become the clouds.”

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:29.644
In the same way you people have to understand

00:01:30.858 --> 00:01:37.720
that unless and until I allow the Sun, that’s the Spirit,

00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:43.994
to evaporate this water from me, means to give to others,

00:01:46.287 --> 00:01:50.251
how will I develop this guru principle within myself?

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.563
You cannot have salt in the seawater

00:01:53.683 --> 00:01:56.138
unless and until you evaporate it.

00:01:57.995 --> 00:02:01.526
So you cannot become a guru unless and until you allow

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:04.928
the evaporation of this water,

00:02:05.048 --> 00:02:07.697
of this wealth, the money that you have.

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:22.758
But if you are not matured enough, like the sea,

00:02:23.995 --> 00:02:30.288
then you will remain at a level that, like mad,

00:02:33.621 --> 00:02:36.710
collecting all the muck of the world

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.786
and ultimately end up in some lunatic asylum.

00:02:42.658 --> 00:02:46.022
Because all maryadas are lost, all dharma is lost.

00:02:46.142 --> 00:02:49.446
Without guru principle, how you can have dharma?

00:02:50.342 --> 00:02:52.050
You do not think of anybody else,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.761
you do not even think of your father, mother or anyone,

00:02:54.881 --> 00:02:56.878
you don’t think of your collective work,

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.320
you don’t think of the world. That’s too much.

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.120
So you become small, small, small, small, small.

00:03:08.651 --> 00:03:11.890
But when this Lakshmi tattwa starts,

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:18.502
that’s the first inkling of love, love for others.

00:03:20.372 --> 00:03:22.974
I know you all love Me very much.

00:03:24.038 --> 00:03:27.750
But it’s not complete reflection of your Mother.

00:03:28.884 --> 00:03:31.634
You have to love each other

00:03:32.395 --> 00:03:37.074
and share everything with each other, with love.

00:03:42.105 --> 00:03:49.198
Then this first light of love, Lakshmi,
starts showing in you.

00:03:50.435 --> 00:03:58.525
In that light when you move,
you become very deeply generous,

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:01.322
enjoy your generosity.
