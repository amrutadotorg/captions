00:10.130 --> 00:13.558
So Lakshmi is born out of the Guru principle.

00:16.494 --> 00:21.397
And this Guru principle starts working in you,

00:21.517 --> 00:26.006
when you have this Lakshmi principle awakened.

00:26.126 --> 00:30.637
Not money, I’m not saying money. Is the Lakshmi principle

00:31.406 --> 00:33.004
when you start thinking,

00:33.124 --> 00:37.675
“What sweet thing I should give to another?”

00:41.713 --> 00:45.862
When you start thinking, “What should I do for others?”

00:48.156 --> 00:57.761
You have to be extremely
sweet, soft, not dry, not dry people.

01:01.166 --> 01:04.857
“How to express my love?”

01:06.627 --> 01:10.767
So first thing is, as the sea spreads its wings

01:10.887 --> 01:16.071
and says, “All right, let the sun take away my water,

01:16.191 --> 01:22.386
let me boil, let it become the clouds.”

01:25.711 --> 01:29.644
In the same way you people have to understand

01:30.858 --> 01:37.720
that unless and until I allow the Sun, that’s the Spirit,

01:38.945 --> 01:43.994
to evaporate this water from me, means to give to others,

01:46.287 --> 01:50.251
how will I develop this guru principle within myself?

01:50.544 --> 01:53.563
You cannot have salt in the seawater

01:53.683 --> 01:56.138
unless and until you evaporate it.

01:57.995 --> 02:01.526
So you cannot become a guru unless and until you allow

02:01.646 --> 02:04.928
the evaporation of this water,

02:05.048 --> 02:07.697
of this wealth, the money that you have.

02:14.386 --> 02:22.758
But if you are not matured enough, like the sea,

02:23.995 --> 02:30.288
then you will remain at a level that, like mad,

02:33.621 --> 02:36.710
collecting all the muck of the world

02:36.830 --> 02:40.786
and ultimately end up in some lunatic asylum.

02:42.658 --> 02:46.022
Because all maryadas are lost, all dharma is lost.

02:46.142 --> 02:49.446
Without guru principle, how you can have dharma?

02:50.342 --> 02:52.050
You do not think of anybody else,

02:52.170 --> 02:54.761
you do not even think of your father, mother or anyone,

02:54.881 --> 02:56.878
you don’t think of your collective work,

02:56.999 --> 03:00.320
you don’t think of the world. That’s too much.

03:01.479 --> 03:05.120
So you become small, small, small, small, small.

03:08.651 --> 03:11.890
But when this Lakshmi tattwa starts,

03:12.010 --> 03:18.502
that’s the first inkling of love, love for others.

03:20.372 --> 03:22.974
I know you all love Me very much.

03:24.038 --> 03:27.750
But it’s not complete reflection of your Mother.

03:28.884 --> 03:31.634
You have to love each other

03:32.395 --> 03:37.074
and share everything with each other, with love.

03:42.105 --> 03:49.198
Then this first light of love, Lakshmi,
starts showing in you.

03:50.435 --> 03:58.525
In that light when you move,
you become very deeply generous,

03:59.533 --> 04:01.322
enjoy your generosity.
