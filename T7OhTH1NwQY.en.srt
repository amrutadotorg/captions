1991-09-01 Shri Krishna puja - The technique of the play, Cabella, Italy

2
00:00:02,460 --> 00:00:09,527
Today, we have decided to worship the Yogeshwara.

3
00:00:10,827 --> 00:00:17,727
I think that is the greatest name of Shri Krishna for us.

4
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:23,627
That means He is the Ishwara of yoga.

5
00:00:25,293 --> 00:00:29,460
Yoga means the union, as you know, with the divine.

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:34,560
But also yoga has another meaning which means yukti.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,460
In English language to translate it properly is not possible.

8
00:00:39,627 --> 00:00:46,326
We can call it as... Yukti means the trick.

9
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:55,460
But trick is always connected with something funny and bad.

10
00:00:55,560 --> 00:01:00,693
But this 'yukti' means the technique. But 'technique' is mechanical.

11
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:04,360
So I couldn't find any proper word for 'yukti'.

12
00:01:04,627 --> 00:01:12,293
But one can say it is: to know the technique and the trick of the technique

13
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,360
is also another meaning of yoga - yukti.

14
00:01:19,493 --> 00:01:24,360
So, even if you are connected, if you do not know the trick of the union

15
00:01:24,827 --> 00:01:31,360
then it is useless, it is of no avail.

16
00:01:32,393 --> 00:01:39,727
So what one has to learn, after getting realization, is

17
00:01:40,527 --> 00:01:44,360
not only the technique but the trick of the technique.

18
00:01:45,793 --> 00:01:49,393
At Krishna's level when we reach

19
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:54,360
- it is an incarnation after Shri Rama's.

20
00:01:55,527 --> 00:02:01,593
So Shri Rama came as a 'Maryada Purushottama', which means

21
00:02:01,627 --> 00:02:16,360
a person who is a complete ideal of maryadas and a benevolent king.

22
00:02:17,827 --> 00:02:25,360
But in the case of Shri Krishna it was a different phase

23
00:02:25,493 --> 00:02:29,627
because people had become extremely serious, very disciplined,

24
00:02:29,827 --> 00:02:37,360
and were leading a life which was, we can say, over-dharmic.

25
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:48,827
And this had put the people at a level, fixed,

26
00:02:50,293 --> 00:02:53,527
and they thought that "If we are doing all these things every day

27
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:56,860
then it's alright. We have reached the last."

28
00:02:57,460 --> 00:03:00,393
So Shri Krishna had to come -

29
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:03,860
Himself, Shri Vishnu, came as Shri Krishna -

30
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:13,360
to tell us about the ascent, and that - all this is just a play.

31
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:24,827
But only a person who is a master of the play can do the play.

32
00:03:25,693 --> 00:03:31,360
So to know the play. Supposing you have communication,

33
00:03:32,426 --> 00:03:35,360
you have electrical communications.

34
00:03:35,727 --> 00:03:40,727
Now you don't know how to play with it - play.

35
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:45,793
Not how to know or how to connect but to play.

36
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:50,360
Supposing only you know all the technique,

37
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:55,360
then it becomes quite a headache,

38
00:03:56,326 --> 00:03:59,360
because all the time you think you are doing it.

39
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,727
You have to do this and, this is to be done, that has to be done,

40
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:08,360
and this connection is not all right; that should be properly connected.

41
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,493
You get tired and bored.

42
00:04:12,527 --> 00:04:19,493
But if it's a play for you, just a play. For any master it's a play.

43
00:04:20,627 --> 00:04:26,360
If it's just a play for you, then you don't feel tired - it's fun.

44
00:04:28,493 --> 00:04:33,360
And that is what is Leela, that's why He is called 'Leeladhara' -

45
00:04:33,593 --> 00:04:40,360
because He is a master. He came as a master, master not as a guru,

46
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:49,360
but master of all the arts of this yoga, yukti.

47
00:04:52,560 --> 00:05:02,360
So He's so deft, He's so capable, that for Him it's a play.

48
00:05:03,827 --> 00:05:09,627
All this is a play for Him. And this is what one has to know,

49
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:16,360
that, in yoga, everything that you do should be just a play.

50
00:05:17,493 --> 00:05:23,360
Say, getting up at 5 o'clock in the morning, should be a play.

51
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,793
In the morning you get up.

52
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:35,627
The sun has not yet come, to suggest what you have to do,

53
00:05:36,527 --> 00:05:41,693
and the moon has departed, and in that twilight

54
00:05:42,393 --> 00:05:47,360
or a little darkness if you get up, it's very beautiful.

55
00:05:49,326 --> 00:05:53,326
And at that time you sit down for your dhyaan.

56
00:05:53,493 --> 00:06:01,326
But it's not a serious thing, it's not something that is boring, it's a play.

57
00:06:03,593 --> 00:06:06,593
But for that you have to be a master.

58
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:13,360
If you are the master of yoga, then it's a play.

59
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:16,627
So first Shri Rama's state has to be there

60
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:22,360
where you become really a Vishwa Nirmala Dharmi

61
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:28,360
so that it becomes your play.

62
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:38,360
Now communication with the Divine has to go to the whole world.

63
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:47,593
The whole world has to get this communication that you have received.

64
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,593
For this part Shri Krishna arranged something

65
00:06:52,326 --> 00:06:57,760
in His lifetime in a very simple way, as a child.

66
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,360
It looks, very childlike.

67
00:07:03,827 --> 00:07:10,360
Like when the Gopi's were taking their baths He hid their clothes -

68
00:07:10,627 --> 00:07:13,793
I mean, Indian women are never fully nude, never -

69
00:07:14,627 --> 00:07:19,326
He hid their saris and all that and He could see their back,

70
00:07:19,326 --> 00:07:23,360
this little boy. What is for a little boy?

71
00:07:25,293 --> 00:07:30,293
He's sitting on a tree and is trying to raise their Kundalini.

72
00:07:31,527 --> 00:07:37,360
They're coming out of the river Jamuna which is being vibrated by Radha.

73
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:42,360
Already there are vibrations, you see - raising their Kundalini.

74
00:07:45,293 --> 00:07:53,426
Then they are taking the water and He breaks their pitchers, from the back,

75
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:57,293
which have also got vibrated water in.

76
00:07:58,426 --> 00:08:02,426
So the vibrated water falls on the backs of these ladies and

77
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:07,560
He tries to awaken their Kundalini.

78
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:11,760
See the play of a child,

79
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,360
how He tried to play in His childhood, just like a child.

80
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:28,360
And then He shows, later on, His child-like expertise

81
00:08:29,827 --> 00:08:34,793
in dealing with politics, with people, with communication and everything.

82
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,593
And His power was Radha, Radha 'Ra' 'dha' .

83
00:08:40,627 --> 00:08:44,560
'Ra' means energy, 'Dha' means the one which sustains 'Ra-dha'.

84
00:08:46,360 --> 00:08:48,793
So the "Dha Re Di Sa Dharmaha"  as they say.

85
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:54,360
In the same way Radha 'Ra' 'Dha' - the one who sustains the energy.

86
00:08:55,527 --> 00:09:01,660
So the first quality that He got from Her is - She's the 'Alaahda Dayini'.

87
00:09:02,393 --> 00:09:06,527
I couldn't find a word in English for 'Alaahd'.

88
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:13,593
'Alaahd' is when you suddenly see something nice and joy starts.

89
00:09:14,593 --> 00:09:16,593
Just feel very happy.

90
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,360
I mean, there are very few words in English, as you know,

91
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:28,360
for joy or at the most happiness.

92
00:09:29,426 --> 00:09:32,426
But 'Alaahd' is a kind of a joy which,

93
00:09:32,627 --> 00:09:38,360
as you get the fresh air - then how you feel.

94
00:09:38,426 --> 00:09:41,360
That is Alaahd. So She is 'Alaahda Dayini'.

95
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,360
She's the one who is the giver of Alaahd.

96
00:09:44,593 --> 00:09:51,627
And so with Her powers, He could work out this Alaahd

97
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,426
to all the people with whom He was connected.

98
00:09:55,793 --> 00:10:01,360
So all the Gopas and Gopis who were with Him had to do Rasa.

99
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:04,360
'Ra' is 'energy', 'Sa' means 'with'.

100
00:10:04,593 --> 00:10:08,326
To dance with the energy that is Radhaji.

101
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:13,493
He used to just play the flute and She used to dance,

102
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:18,527
the energy used to pass through Her hands to all the other people

103
00:10:18,593 --> 00:10:22,360
and the Kundalini would be awakened.

104
00:10:23,693 --> 00:10:27,293
So this was another play that He had.

105
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,360
So in the play only He raised the Kundalini.

106
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:37,560
But in modern times it's very difficult,

107
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:44,326
it is not easy to raise Kundalinis in modern times in that way.

108
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:52,627
I mean, nobody will understand also.

109
00:10:55,527 --> 00:11:02,360
So in modern times when Sahaja Yoga is not just raising the Kundalini

110
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:05,693
but giving the complete knowledge about Sahaja Yoga

111
00:11:06,393 --> 00:11:10,527
and also empowering the person with

112
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:15,660
the power to give others realization, it was tremendous task.

113
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:19,860
And that's why we had to find out these methods

114
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:24,360
by which we could give realization to people.

115
00:11:26,793 --> 00:11:33,326
In those days Kundalinis were awakened but the Sahasrara was not broken.

116
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:36,360
So Kundalini must be somewhere hanging in the Agnya,

117
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,326
maybe at heart, maybe somewhere.

118
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:47,360
And such people became the seekers and that's how we find,

119
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:53,627
today, people are here as Sahaja Yogis whose Sahasrara's are open

120
00:11:53,627 --> 00:11:57,660
and they know all the yukti of Sahaja Yoga.

121
00:11:59,326 --> 00:12:06,493
But there are subtler and subtler yuktis of Sahaja Yoga which you have to master.

122
00:12:07,426 --> 00:12:15,426
The first is that His character was 'madhuriya', meaning the sweetness.

123
00:12:16,727 --> 00:12:23,360
Sweetness. We always say, "He's sweet like honey".

124
00:12:25,727 --> 00:12:32,360
So when He talked to anyone or He communicated with anyone,

125
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:42,360
it was through sweetness; and this communication,

126
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:49,360
if you have not developed, then you are nowhere near Yoga.

127
00:12:50,693 --> 00:12:56,693
To talk to someone sweetly, automatically.

128
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:03,326
Everything is madhuriya for Him, His talking,

129
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:11,360
His actions, His face. Everything is madhuriya.

130
00:13:12,793 --> 00:13:18,360
So when we talk of communications first of all the greatest thing is

131
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:21,560
the communication between human beings

132
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:27,460
and when we have to think of the communication with the human beings

133
00:13:27,727 --> 00:13:32,360
many people think that by aggression you will communicate better,

134
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,560
which is not true.

135
00:13:37,593 --> 00:13:41,627
I mean if somebody wants to get something out of someone, say;

136
00:13:43,393 --> 00:13:49,360
so you go there and just talk, "I have to have! How can you do it?

137
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,527
This, that!" As it is - it's no good.

138
00:13:55,560 --> 00:14:01,293
But if you are sweet and start talking sweetly

139
00:14:01,627 --> 00:14:07,360
then 99% will definitely dissolve.

140
00:14:08,627 --> 00:14:15,360
So to dissolve people with sweetness - how to do it -

141
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,560
that trick one has to learn:

142
00:14:23,793 --> 00:14:27,793
how, with sweetness, you can dissolve people.

143
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:31,627
This is one of His special qualities,

144
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:38,693
that you talk to someone in such a manner, genuinely,

145
00:14:39,293 --> 00:14:43,360
in a very sweet manner, and

146
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:52,593
the problem between you and that person will be dissolved, absolutely.

147
00:14:53,793 --> 00:14:56,360
Now there are many tricks

148
00:14:56,827 --> 00:15:03,360
and how to talk to someone is one of the biggest things one has to learn.

149
00:15:05,326 --> 00:15:07,560
First of all you must always show

150
00:15:07,593 --> 00:15:11,360
that you are less intelligent than another person.

151
00:15:16,593 --> 00:15:19,593
Like if I'm talking to a scientist I will say,

152
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,360
"I'm sorry I don't know any science you know.

153
00:15:24,527 --> 00:15:31,360
I'm no good for a scientist." So they feel "ahhhh, very good."

154
00:15:38,693 --> 00:15:43,693
If you have to talk to some musician, you must say "I don't know any music.

155
00:15:44,627 --> 00:15:50,360
No, I just have learned a little bit, but not much."

156
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:53,693
Musician feels very happy.

157
00:15:53,727 --> 00:15:58,360
You may call it a pampering of the ego. You may call it [that].

158
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:05,360
But there's no harm in saying that "I'm nothing to compared to you".

159
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:14,360
So the first trick is complete humility when you talk to another person.

160
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:20,560
It's the sign of greatness, it's the sign of fulfilment.

161
00:16:20,627 --> 00:16:26,360
As the trees, when they are laden with fruits they bend down.

162
00:16:29,627 --> 00:16:36,760
So, first of all, if you say "I am no one. I don't understand anything

163
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:42,360
but I would like to hear" this is first.

164
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,693
The first quality of communication is to be

165
00:16:46,693 --> 00:16:48,693
extremely humble about yourself.

166
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:53,360
The other person should not know who you are.

167
00:16:55,693 --> 00:16:59,360
And there's a lot of fun in it.

168
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:06,393
Say for example now - I can say about Myself

169
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:10,693
that My husband was very highly placed in India.

170
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:16,360
But I met a friend in Delhi - she was studying with Me in school

171
00:17:16,560 --> 00:17:21,360
and in college - and She asked Me "where do you live?"

172
00:17:21,527 --> 00:17:23,360
So, I told her, "In Meenabagh," which was

173
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:27,293
just a useless, small, little place

174
00:17:27,326 --> 00:17:30,360
meant for very ordinary officers because they had

175
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:34,527
not allotted us any house or anything so, temporarily, we were there.

176
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,527
She said "what? What is your husband doing?"

177
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:40,527
I said "He's some government servant." I didn't tell her [his position]!

178
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:48,426
He came down, so he just looked at Me and he smiled.

179
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,360
She said "do you know him?" I said "He's My husband".

180
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,493
She was shocked, "He's your husband? Oh my God!

181
00:17:55,593 --> 00:17:59,326
Why didn't you tell me?" Immediately the whole thing changed

182
00:17:59,493 --> 00:18:01,593
and she felt so ashamed of herself.

183
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,360
She had started looking down upon Me,

184
00:18:04,360 --> 00:18:07,360
"Ah, Married to some clerk or someone."

185
00:18:12,527 --> 00:18:20,360
So the best thing is to play down. Play down everything.

186
00:18:21,527 --> 00:18:23,493
Now I know of certain Sahaja Yogis they say,

187
00:18:23,527 --> 00:18:28,360
"oh Mother has giving me such powers. I can do this, I can do that."

188
00:18:28,693 --> 00:18:31,360
This boastfullness is of no use.

189
00:18:31,827 --> 00:18:35,860
"I haven't got any powers you see. I'm just a Sahaja Yogi that's all.

190
00:18:35,860 --> 00:18:39,360
But if you want I can try."

191
00:18:44,627 --> 00:18:53,727
So play down as much as you can. Practice this at home,

192
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:58,360
first practice and then do it.

193
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:05,293
So that is one of the greatest qualities of communication with others.

194
00:19:08,393 --> 00:19:11,393
Second thing: I think in the whole of Gita, if you read it,

195
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,627
there's one is very important thing.

196
00:19:12,627 --> 00:19:15,460
He says "krodho'bhijaayate sammohah"  (Gita 2:61)].

197
00:19:15,627 --> 00:19:20,460
You see among all the worst things that we have -

198
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:25,360
according to Him we have six enemies.

199
00:19:27,793 --> 00:19:31,493
But in Gita He started with 'Krodha'.

200
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:35,360
He said - it starts with Krodha, means anger.

201
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:43,727
If you have anger within you then you are not a master at all.

202
00:19:44,727 --> 00:19:50,360
There's no need for a master to get angry because he can play about.

203
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,527
He can make you dance like this.

204
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:57,360
What is the need to lose your temper?

205
00:19:58,693 --> 00:20:02,693
But that mastery if you don't have, of handling people,

206
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:07,727
then after five/six minutes of talk your voice starts raising

207
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:12,693
and something starts barking,

208
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,527
because that temper is still inside you, burning.

209
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:25,293
But for a master there should be no temper - no need.

210
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,793
He has started with Krodha, that: with the Krodha all problems start.

211
00:20:33,493 --> 00:20:36,360
from one to another to another to another.

212
00:20:36,493 --> 00:20:40,693
So we should watch out if we are angry people.

213
00:20:44,527 --> 00:20:51,660
Anger comes from Vishuddhi. Starts from liver - Vishnu -

214
00:20:52,326 --> 00:20:54,460
but is expressed through Vishuddhi.

215
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:58,360
The face becomes red, eyes become red.

216
00:20:58,693 --> 00:21:03,593
From the mouth you start saying all kinds of horrible things

217
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,793
and the whole expression becomes so different when you are angry.

218
00:21:09,527 --> 00:21:15,360
So this anger is to be seen, "Where is it within us? Where is it this anger?

219
00:21:15,793 --> 00:21:18,493
Liver? alright, I'll put it right."

220
00:21:18,693 --> 00:21:23,760
So to master it you have to face yourself clearly.

221
00:21:24,493 --> 00:21:26,360
Many people I have seen people say

222
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,627
"Mother you know this lady is such a hot tempered women,

223
00:21:28,627 --> 00:21:31,727
she is so dominating. She does this, she does that."

224
00:21:32,360 --> 00:21:34,560
But if you tell her she says, "No no, I don't do that way.

225
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:36,627
No, no I'm very good."

226
00:21:37,627 --> 00:21:43,360
"But how other's saying that?", "I don't know but I'm very good" - finished!

227
00:21:44,426 --> 00:21:47,360
If somebody is saying that then you watch yourself -

228
00:21:47,793 --> 00:21:54,360
do you get into tempers or not? Are you loosing your temper?

229
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:57,360
It's very easy to make it out then face it.

230
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,360
So the trick of the trade is to face yourself

231
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:05,527
and see for yourself how much you are lacking.

232
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:11,560
So first is humility, which should be genuine,

233
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:19,693
and secondly is equanimity - no temper.

234
00:22:20,426 --> 00:22:22,360
There is no need to take to temper.

235
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:25,527
At the most you can say "What are you doing?

236
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,860
Why are you doing that way?"

237
00:22:28,326 --> 00:22:31,360
Now if you do something, you know, maybe something I might say which

238
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,360
I would not like, so I don't want to say."

239
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:40,360
Like that - at the most! Up to that point is alright;

240
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:45,360
that you should say that, "I dislike it", but not to go further with it.

241
00:22:48,827 --> 00:22:52,627
If you just stop at a point,

242
00:22:55,360 --> 00:22:59,360
then this habit of getting into temper will go away.

243
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:02,627
This arrogance will go away, which has to go.

244
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:06,360
This arrogance has to go, this temper has to go.

245
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:10,360
And then, you'll be surprised, you will feel very much relieved.

246
00:23:10,627 --> 00:23:14,627
Because this anger, once it comes in, reacts,

247
00:23:14,860 --> 00:23:19,760
and catches your left Vishuddi, and you become guilty,

248
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360
you feel very bad - "Why I said so, I should not have said this."

249
00:23:25,793 --> 00:23:31,460
So Vishuddi's finished, left Vishuddhi, means - it's a headache.

250
00:23:32,360 --> 00:23:35,827
It goes on accumulating like a store house there - all your anger,

251
00:23:36,293 --> 00:23:40,493
temper whatever you have - and this left Vishuddhi catches,

252
00:23:41,493 --> 00:23:44,460
and you know the problems of left Vishuddhi.

253
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:52,293
So if you get angry with someone, don't feel guilty

254
00:23:52,860 --> 00:23:57,360
but go before the mirror and slap yourself nicely, twice.

255
00:23:58,793 --> 00:24:01,360
Now you get angry with yourself, "let me get angry!"

256
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:04,360
Then stand before the mirror, "shoo shoo shoo" like that

257
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:12,527
In the same manner as you get angry try to act,

258
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,760
you'll never feel guilty.

259
00:24:16,293 --> 00:24:19,360
Or maybe more angry - would be better.

260
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:22,293
So you empty out your left Vishuddhi.

261
00:24:23,593 --> 00:24:26,560
Next time you won't do it.

262
00:24:27,793 --> 00:24:31,693
But feeling guilty means you will repeat and repeat the same thing.

263
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:38,693
So this temper is expressed by men and women differently.

264
00:24:40,326 --> 00:24:41,360
And I'm very much worried about

265
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:46,360
the women sometimes because they take to water power - then I'm lost.

266
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:51,660
But those who have ego too much, cry much more. That's the sign.

267
00:24:52,393 --> 00:24:57,360
I've seen. If you say anything to them immediately they start crying,

268
00:24:58,793 --> 00:25:04,426
because already the left Vishuddhi is there, full, like a full balloon

269
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:08,326
and when you touch them it becomes water.

270
00:25:10,393 --> 00:25:15,627
But men, their temper is a different style, as you know very well,

271
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,593
that: when they get angry they might fight with each other,

272
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:25,360
box everyone and then settle down nicely and have something to drink.

273
00:25:28,627 --> 00:25:30,793
"Let us have it out!" you see, they'll say. Take out.

274
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,827
But women don't, they keep it there

275
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:38,693
and once they keep it then it becomes tears, it starts coming down.

276
00:25:38,860 --> 00:25:43,827
So, if these are just tears out of joy, happiness, that's different,

277
00:25:44,527 --> 00:25:48,426
or out of feelings for others - but it is not that,

278
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:52,360
but it's tears just to impress another person that

279
00:25:52,360 --> 00:25:55,360
you are very sad or something.

280
00:26:05,627 --> 00:26:11,393
So the second trick is how to master your own temper

281
00:26:11,727 --> 00:26:15,360
and the third one is how to master

282
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:22,360
the temper of others - that's even better.

283
00:26:24,793 --> 00:26:27,293
I don't know if I have told you the trick of

284
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,360
Gagangan Maharaj, when I went to him.

285
00:26:31,493 --> 00:26:34,293
He is a very hot tempered avadhuta, sitting on

286
00:26:34,293 --> 00:26:36,360
a tiger, and he's lost his legs, because he was feeling hot

287
00:26:36,527 --> 00:26:38,360
so he was sitting in the water

288
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:43,727
all the time, so his feet are useless and he goes on a tiger, they say.

289
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:46,293
I never saw the tiger, of course.

290
00:26:46,326 --> 00:26:49,593
But he knows about Me and all that and he told everyone about Me

291
00:26:49,627 --> 00:26:51,593
so I went to see him.

292
00:26:51,793 --> 00:26:57,360
And he's supposed to control the rain. It was quite a steep climb

293
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,393
for about one and a half hours.

294
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:04,326
And as soon as I stepped in, it started raining, raining,

295
00:27:04,326 --> 00:27:07,593
raining heavily throughout and he couldn't stop it,

296
00:27:08,527 --> 00:27:10,493
so he felt very challenged!

297
00:27:10,693 --> 00:27:14,627
When I went up he was sitting on his own stone outside the cave,

298
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:16,360
and he was doing like this [twisting his head], with anger.

299
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:21,393
He didn't know what to do. I looked at him then I walked

300
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:25,793
into his cave and sat down nicely, then he came, they brought him.

301
00:27:28,326 --> 00:27:30,360
He touched my feet, everything he did and then he said,

302
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,360
"You tell me now - why did you not allow me to stop the water?

303
00:27:34,360 --> 00:27:39,627
You got completely drenched. I'm very angry with this rain I know.

304
00:27:40,693 --> 00:27:44,426
But why did you do that? Is it to control my ego?"

305
00:27:44,627 --> 00:27:49,326
I said "No, not at all I never knew you had ego or anything,"

306
00:27:52,393 --> 00:27:57,527
"Then why?" So - because I'm a master as you know -

307
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:02,693
I said "You see you are a sanyasi and you brought a sari for Me,

308
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:05,326
that too of an orange colour, and I would

309
00:28:05,393 --> 00:28:07,693
not take the orange colour sari from you.

310
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:10,660
Any sari I wouldn't take, because you're a sanyasi.

311
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,360
But I had to get drenched to get the sari, isn't it?"

312
00:28:14,560 --> 00:28:22,360
Immediately - he melted away. But I had to be the master.

313
00:28:25,827 --> 00:28:33,827
First of all how to melt him and secondly the master of his mind.

314
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:41,560
This is the subtler part of it. You can be a master of a person.

315
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:45,627
Like that you can know what he has done for you,

316
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:50,760
what he has prepared for you, what is coming for you.

317
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,360
I wouldn't say that you'd know all the whole future.

318
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:58,627
But if you try just to know about a person -

319
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:03,360
you can know everything about that person, very simple.

320
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:07,360
So first try to understand a person.

321
00:29:09,627 --> 00:29:12,627
My father had lots of tricks with him, I know,

322
00:29:13,426 --> 00:29:16,460
and a very humorous person.

323
00:29:17,627 --> 00:29:20,360
And one day My brother told me, Babamama,

324
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:23,360
that he has a friend who sings very well.

325
00:29:24,393 --> 00:29:26,560
So I asked my father "How does he sing?"

326
00:29:26,660 --> 00:29:30,727
"Oh, he is very courageous," he said. I said "Why?"

327
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,493
"He sings whether he knows or not - that's the trouble!"

328
00:29:35,360 --> 00:29:40,293
What an exact description he gave Me of this gentleman!

329
00:29:40,493 --> 00:29:41,793
"He's very courageous you see.

330
00:29:42,326 --> 00:29:44,793
He doesn't know but he sings - quite alright,

331
00:29:45,426 --> 00:29:48,860
so he's very courageous." I mean, he didn't say anything against him -

332
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,627
he said "He's courageous" -

333
00:29:50,727 --> 00:29:53,360
but he gave Me the complete picture of the gentleman that:

334
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:56,527
"You have to be careful you see, he might start singing in a funny way,

335
00:29:56,560 --> 00:30:00,360
you shouldn't laugh." And, all that came in that 'courageous' word.

336
00:30:00,693 --> 00:30:05,360
In the same way, if you study someone, you see,

337
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:13,360
then you will just describe that person in an interesting way,

338
00:30:14,326 --> 00:30:16,360
and you will not feel that this person has these bad habits

339
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:20,360
or those bad habits or this is wrong with him, that is wrong,

340
00:30:20,493 --> 00:30:24,360
but you'll describe - it's part of that person.

341
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:33,360
It's a way of knowing a person in totality with all his defects,

342
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:35,360
with all his qualities, with everything

343
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:39,360
and accepting that person as he is.

344
00:30:41,293 --> 00:30:43,560
If that mastery you can have.

345
00:30:44,326 --> 00:30:48,393
Now how will you have? If your attention is not on his

346
00:30:48,493 --> 00:30:52,426
qualities you'll only know his bad things.

347
00:30:54,426 --> 00:30:59,460
And if you know his qualities then bad things will be there, a little bit,

348
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:04,460
but they'll just be adding a little massala to his character.

349
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,560
You'll feel "ahhhh, that's it, you see, he is a little bit like that."

350
00:31:10,393 --> 00:31:16,560
Little additional swara (musical note) is added to his character.

351
00:31:17,493 --> 00:31:22,560
And you wouldn't mind it so much, such a person. You'll really enjoy.

352
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:26,660
Like my son-in-law is very fond of dogs

353
00:31:27,326 --> 00:31:29,527
and his wife says, "no dog in the house," it's a flat.

354
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:32,493
So there is a fight between them for the dog.

355
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,793
So Prabhat said "You never meet me,"

356
00:31:35,326 --> 00:31:41,360
I said "This is not proper but next time I have decided to be a dog,"

357
00:31:41,827 --> 00:31:47,827
Immediately he took the point. You see, so the way you talk to a person

358
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:54,360
you can suggest to him what is so special about that person

359
00:31:54,560 --> 00:31:56,827
or the defects of that person.

360
00:31:57,860 --> 00:32:00,894
But you need not say directly something to him.

361
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:08,693
If you say indirectly, in such a humorous manner

362
00:32:09,693 --> 00:32:11,693
that the person will understand.

363
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:20,460
So in communication with others you have to be a very humorous person.

364
00:32:22,393 --> 00:32:27,527
But mostly I've seen people have humour if somebody cannot walk straight.

365
00:32:27,593 --> 00:32:29,860
If a physical problem is there they'll laugh.

366
00:32:30,693 --> 00:32:34,894
If he has not properly made his hair then they will laugh.

367
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:40,560
On some sort of a very superficial thing they laugh. This is not humorous.

368
00:32:40,827 --> 00:32:44,894
This is some sort of a criticism in laughter.

369
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:53,393
Or some people have a humour like this that they say sarcastic things.

370
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,593
that's no good.

371
00:32:55,693 --> 00:33:00,360
You say one word to somebody, sarcastic; you think you are very brilliant,

372
00:33:00,560 --> 00:33:02,627
but you are lost forever for that person.

373
00:33:02,860 --> 00:33:06,360
That person will remember "He said such a such things to me."

374
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:11,693
So sarcasm is against you completely; against Sahaja Yoga.

375
00:33:11,927 --> 00:33:16,360
If you have to say something, say it in such a manner

376
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:18,627
that it doesn't hurt the person,

377
00:33:20,293 --> 00:33:27,360
and the person enjoys that subtle humour

378
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:31,360
and understands also that "This is the problem with me".

379
00:33:33,894 --> 00:33:44,360
Now in a humorous way, if I have to tell something to you -

380
00:33:44,860 --> 00:33:47,693
I need not tell you directly, "You are like this, you are like that,"

381
00:33:47,793 --> 00:33:54,393
but I'll say, "There was one crow which came to my house..."

382
00:33:54,927 --> 00:33:58,527
and, like that, I can transfer all your qualities to that crow

383
00:33:58,560 --> 00:34:02,960
and describe to you and say that, "This crow did like this and did that."

384
00:34:04,426 --> 00:34:07,527
Immediately you'll start thinking, "Is it about me Mother was saying

385
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:15,360
or about the crow?" So transfer it to somebody else.

386
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:18,493
Transfer it to somebody else, that's the best way.

387
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,527
For example, if you want to say that:

388
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:24,426
all the names of the people who are coming to the puja

389
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,527
should be there at the right time.

390
00:34:27,793 --> 00:34:29,593
So now, this time, Americans [are hosting].

391
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:32,894
Alright, "Americans have sent the word..." - they have not -

392
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,627
"...have sent the word that all the names should be there."

393
00:34:35,827 --> 00:34:39,360
No harm telling such lies, no harm.

394
00:34:40,693 --> 00:34:44,293
So that people will not put it on you, they'll not be angry with you.

395
00:34:44,326 --> 00:34:47,527
At the most they'll be angry with the Americans - doesn't matter,

396
00:34:48,593 --> 00:34:52,460
for the time being. So transfer it.

397
00:34:52,894 --> 00:34:59,560
And this transference is 'astantar' as they call it.

398
00:34:59,727 --> 00:35:06,493
To transfer from one hand to another hand, Shri Krishna was an expert.

399
00:35:09,460 --> 00:35:11,360
There is a story about Him.

400
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,360
He is called as Ranchordas, means He ran away from the battlefield.

401
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:20,493
He doesn't mind "I ran away, so what?"

402
00:35:21,326 --> 00:35:25,693
The reason was like this: there was a very bad rakshasa

403
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:30,593
who had all kinds of boons from Brahmadeva

404
00:35:30,860 --> 00:35:34,360
and Shri Krishna didn't know how to overcome that,

405
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:37,360
nobody knew, and He was killing so many people.

406
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:42,827
So He thought of a trick, transfer it to somebody else.

407
00:35:43,627 --> 00:35:48,560
He knew of another great yogi you see, special type,

408
00:35:48,793 --> 00:35:55,293
who has meditated and taken a boon from the same Brahmadeva

409
00:35:55,493 --> 00:36:01,360
that: "If I'm sleeping and anybody disturbs my sleep

410
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:03,393
and if I open my eyes

411
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:09,393
and look at that person, that person should become ashes - bhasma."

412
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:15,793
So Shri Krishna thought of Him, "Better transfer the job from me to Him."

413
00:36:16,627 --> 00:36:20,593
So He started running away from the field.

414
00:36:20,727 --> 00:36:23,593
So this Rakshasa also followed Him.

415
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:31,627
Then Shri Krishna stealthily went into the cave of this avadhuta,

416
00:36:31,894 --> 00:36:38,360
and put His own shawl on top of Him, covered Him,

417
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:43,360
and hid himself in the cave.

418
00:36:44,326 --> 00:36:47,693
Now this Rakshasa came here, he thought this was Shri Krishna who was sleeping,

419
00:36:47,894 --> 00:36:50,460
"Ahhh now you are tired, you are sleeping.

420
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,593
Now I'm going to see how you can save yourself."

421
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:56,326
And he started waking [him] up.

422
00:36:56,527 --> 00:37:01,693
This avadhuta got up and looked at him and he became bhasma (ashes).

423
00:37:02,727 --> 00:37:10,393
So transfer your jobs to a more capable (Shri Mataji laughs) person

424
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:17,894
who can do this better, than taking upon yourself

425
00:37:18,460 --> 00:37:21,894
straight-forward, going, "Alright,come long, I'll fight with you."

426
00:37:22,493 --> 00:37:26,693
you cannot win. It's a guerrilla warfare as you call it.

427
00:37:27,493 --> 00:37:32,927
Transfer it, and you can transfer it to somebody,

428
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:37,393
you can make friends with that person, pamper his ego; do what you like.

429
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:42,493
But the main point is that you should get rid of the ills,

430
00:37:42,727 --> 00:37:47,560
the bad, the rakshasas. So you can transfer it to anyone.

431
00:37:49,927 --> 00:37:52,927
And so many tricks He played.

432
00:37:58,827 --> 00:38:06,727
In the Mahabharata, Bhishma had a blessing

433
00:38:07,393 --> 00:38:14,360
that, unless and until he wants to die, nobody can kill him.

434
00:38:17,493 --> 00:38:27,560
So Shri Krishna decided that He should use some tricks.

435
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:34,360
So He told Arjuna that you put him...

436
00:38:34,894 --> 00:38:36,693
He told Arjuna not himself;

437
00:38:36,827 --> 00:38:43,360
He was just doing the chariot drivers job - Sarathi.

438
00:38:43,793 --> 00:38:51,793
So Krishna told him that you just make him sleep on the arrows,

439
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:58,293
let His body be on the arrows and he has to decide that he will die.

440
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:10,693
But Dronacharya was a great guru, also of Arjuna, who was siding with Kauravas.

441
00:39:11,493 --> 00:39:16,660
Now how can you kill this Dhronacharya, big problem.

442
00:39:17,593 --> 00:39:25,693
Because you see, he knew all the tricks of archery.

443
00:39:26,293 --> 00:39:29,560
How are you going to save them?

444
00:39:31,894 --> 00:39:36,460
Because archery is such a thing that he was the master of archery,

445
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:39,793
while Arjuna was his disciple.

446
00:39:40,894 --> 00:40:06,727
So how to stop him, answering back the arrows of Arjuna?

447
00:40:07,326 --> 00:40:10,660
How to do that, that he doesn't answer back?

448
00:40:10,894 --> 00:40:19,927
Because he was a master. So Krishna organized it, in a very special way.

449
00:40:20,527 --> 00:40:24,827
He got a Shikhandi, a eunuch.

450
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:29,360
What is the advantage of having a eunuch? Of course it's a big story

451
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:35,527
how they became Shikhandi. But He got him in front of Arjuna.

452
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,426
A eunuch in India is regarded as a woman,

453
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:49,426
so Dhronacharya said, "I cannot kill a woman,"

454
00:40:51,426 --> 00:40:55,560
and that's how He killed Dhronacharya.

455
00:40:56,827 --> 00:41:02,493
So [He played] these tricks, because to get rid of ill is the main thing.

456
00:41:02,727 --> 00:41:04,693
To get rid of the ill -

457
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:08,527
if you are not capable - you better tell somebody else to get rid.

458
00:41:08,527 --> 00:41:13,493
Because that is very important - to get rid of the evil -

459
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,393
and if you can transfer this to somebody else who is more capable,

460
00:41:18,460 --> 00:41:24,393
in your own humility, you'll do much better than to directly attack that person.

461
00:41:25,326 --> 00:41:27,426
That's Tomfoolery. No use.

462
00:41:28,793 --> 00:41:31,894
So this was the trick of Shri Krishna throughout.

463
00:41:32,493 --> 00:41:38,627
If you have seen Mahabharata. Shri Krishna told Arjuna that,

464
00:41:38,894 --> 00:41:44,326
"Either you can the have all of My army or you can have Me."

465
00:41:44,827 --> 00:41:49,326
Same He told to the Kauravas. The Kauravas said, "We'll have your army."

466
00:41:49,727 --> 00:41:53,960
But Arjuna said, "You will be mine, Krishna You'll be on our side."

467
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:59,560
But He said, "No, I'll be just on the chariot. I'll not hold any weapon."

468
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:06,560
But He is a master of tricks. He does not need any weapons with Him.

469
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,793
Without weapons also He can do everything.

470
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:15,360
So Arjuna said, "alright, You be my chariot driver," and He was there.

471
00:42:16,693 --> 00:42:24,360
Because Shri Krishna knew about each and every thing, mostly He used to smile.

472
00:42:26,293 --> 00:42:28,560
Now, if somebody's telling Me something,

473
00:42:29,393 --> 00:42:33,293
sometimes you will find I also smile, but I try to control

474
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:35,527
because I don't want them to see.

475
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:40,460
But I know what they are doing, what they're up to, what is their trick.

476
00:42:40,760 --> 00:42:44,360
Because you are such a trick master you know all the tricks

477
00:42:44,927 --> 00:42:47,426
and you know what they are playing with you.

478
00:42:47,627 --> 00:42:52,894
So you just smile about it, just to smile in a very sweet way,

479
00:42:53,293 --> 00:42:57,693
"ah, that's it. Ah, of course, what you say is true, no doubt."

480
00:42:59,360 --> 00:43:03,527
But, by this kind of thing, you'll be surprised, your communications

481
00:43:04,460 --> 00:43:07,593
will improve very much with others.

482
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:12,793
Now some people I've seen in Sahaja Yoga - very common, very common,

483
00:43:13,393 --> 00:43:19,527
"Mother", they came and told me, "our leader told me, that you are bhootish."

484
00:43:20,593 --> 00:43:22,460
What is bhootish?"

485
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:26,493
Another one says, "But he told me that you are a bhoot," - alright.

486
00:43:26,693 --> 00:43:31,326
And somebody says, "Mother no he told me that you have got a bhoot in you.

487
00:43:31,360 --> 00:43:34,660
Now what are these three categories? Tell us."

488
00:43:36,593 --> 00:43:41,627
Why to tell anybody you are bhootish or anything? There's no need.

489
00:43:42,360 --> 00:43:46,360
If you know how to correct it, just say "left Swadisthana" and correct it.

490
00:43:46,493 --> 00:43:50,393
Take it out. Ask him, if he had any guru or anything.

491
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,527
Alright, if the person is good natured and a good person

492
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:57,293
then it's even more important.

493
00:43:57,527 --> 00:44:00,493
You should say "It's nothing, you see, it's just a badha from outside.

494
00:44:00,527 --> 00:44:02,360
We'll have to take it out."

495
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:07,593
But a person who has got agnya and all these things,

496
00:44:07,627 --> 00:44:11,894
plus that he has got this left Swadisthana,

497
00:44:12,360 --> 00:44:14,693
then, of course, you should say, "Baba, we cannot help you,"

498
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,560
because you know he is cunning.

499
00:44:18,426 --> 00:44:19,960
What's the use of playing with that?

500
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:22,793
But in Sahaja Yoga we forget.

501
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:27,360
Anybody who comes "Alright, come along, come along, come along."

502
00:44:29,326 --> 00:44:35,426
Everybody is not capable of Sahaja Yoga, one has to know that.

503
00:44:35,860 --> 00:44:37,627
Not the whole world.

504
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,560
Sahaja Yoga can only be given to people who are deserving,

505
00:44:43,660 --> 00:44:49,760
who are seekers and who are courageous - viras.

506
00:44:50,493 --> 00:44:52,593
It's not meant for ordinary people.

507
00:44:53,426 --> 00:44:58,360
So we open our door to everyone and all such people walk in

508
00:44:58,493 --> 00:45:02,693
and then we work very hard on them, do all kinds of things,

509
00:45:03,393 --> 00:45:06,560
and we find that they create problems for us.

510
00:45:08,660 --> 00:45:12,393
So first, only deal with people who are simple,

511
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:15,627
as Shri Krishna dealt with Gopas and Gopis;

512
00:45:16,693 --> 00:45:21,693
and then we can see, in a collective way, if we can face somebody who's complicated.

513
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:28,760
But no use transforming Hitler or Rajneesh, not possible.

514
00:45:29,927 --> 00:45:33,927
So one should not try to do impossible tasks in Sahaja Yoga,

515
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:37,693
which Shri Krishna has shown in His own character

516
00:45:38,627 --> 00:45:42,593
by avoiding things which He didn't want to do - no.

517
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,460
And He did it because He was such a master.

518
00:45:49,593 --> 00:45:53,894
Of course, for Him, it was not necessary to face himself

519
00:45:54,326 --> 00:45:56,560
to master himself, because He knew himself,

520
00:45:56,727 --> 00:46:00,760
He is the Ishwara of yoga, He knew everything.

521
00:46:01,894 --> 00:46:03,593
When you know everything

522
00:46:03,693 --> 00:46:06,693
there is no need for you to master, what are you going to master?

523
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:11,560
On the contrary you sometimes get frightened of yourself, that you know so much.

524
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:22,360
So, best is that, when we are dealing as human beings in Sahaja Yoga,

525
00:46:22,593 --> 00:46:26,894
we have to know ourselves very well - "Now oh that's my speciality."

526
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:32,360
In that you have to see: "How I face myself all the time?

527
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:39,727
Why do I say such a thing? What is lurking in my mind?"

528
00:46:41,393 --> 00:46:45,793
Negativity is something to be seen very clearly within yourself.

529
00:46:46,593 --> 00:46:48,894
As I must have told you so many examples

530
00:46:49,426 --> 00:46:51,393
that the western negativity is like this

531
00:46:51,393 --> 00:46:55,760
that, their minds are all the time labor saving devices.

532
00:46:57,593 --> 00:47:00,660
They don't like to work anyway.

533
00:47:00,827 --> 00:47:08,527
For example, you tell them "You go and telephone to someone."

534
00:47:08,894 --> 00:47:12,360
Immediately they will tell you ten explanations:

535
00:47:12,527 --> 00:47:17,627
he may not be there, his wife will shout, he might have gone to work,

536
00:47:17,860 --> 00:47:21,693
it's ten o'clock, this, that.

537
00:47:22,627 --> 00:47:27,693
But if you telephone he's there, but they won't telephone.

538
00:47:28,727 --> 00:47:33,360
Hundred excuses. Now new excuses have started:

539
00:47:33,527 --> 00:47:37,660
"the computer was not working, fax was not working."

540
00:47:38,293 --> 00:47:41,393
Except for your brain everything works.

541
00:47:42,660 --> 00:47:44,793
But the other way around it is:

542
00:47:45,527 --> 00:47:49,393
your brain is not working and everything is not working.

543
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:53,560
"The lights were not working." I mean, whatever it is.

544
00:47:54,393 --> 00:47:59,660
But you must learn, "Why can't I find the solution?

545
00:48:01,293 --> 00:48:03,560
I must do something."

546
00:48:04,426 --> 00:48:07,527
Like I have told you, the tip of a root -

547
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:13,627
how it manages to go round and round and seek the source of water.

548
00:48:14,727 --> 00:48:17,360
In the same way, are we doing something about it?

549
00:48:17,426 --> 00:48:19,560
Alright, if this is not available, do that,

550
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:21,927
if that is not available do this.

551
00:48:22,493 --> 00:48:25,894
Out of nothing you can do so many things.

552
00:48:26,860 --> 00:48:32,627
But if you want to find out all the time "That cannot be done, that cannot be done".

553
00:48:32,960 --> 00:48:35,760
[That was] not [the case] with Shri Krishna!

554
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,360
After all He was the incarnation of Virata,

555
00:48:40,894 --> 00:48:43,360
the Master of Masters we should say.

556
00:48:43,593 --> 00:48:50,360
Like when Draupadi was in trouble - Draupadi was actually Vishnumaya His sister -

557
00:48:51,393 --> 00:48:52,927
She thought of Shri Krishna.

558
00:48:53,393 --> 00:48:58,727
She was holding onto her sari, when it was pulled out by Duryodhana.

559
00:48:58,894 --> 00:49:01,393
And She was holding it like this (with Her teeth). "Kri",

560
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:04,693
She wanted to say "Krishna" but She said, "If I say 'shna' it will fall down."

561
00:49:05,326 --> 00:49:07,360
So She was holding on.

562
00:49:07,727 --> 00:49:10,527
As soon as She dropped it, "shna",

563
00:49:11,560 --> 00:49:18,426
sari dropped out (of Her mouth), then it's described, about Shri Krishna,

564
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:27,527
"Dwarika me shora bhayo, shor bhayo bhare.

565
00:49:27,693 --> 00:49:33,360
Shankha chakra gadaa padma, Garuda laysidhare."

566
00:49:34,793 --> 00:49:39,460
[Meaning:] that sound went into Dwarika. Now where is Dwarika

567
00:49:39,560 --> 00:49:43,727
and where is Hastinapur - at least a distance of two thousands miles [apart].

568
00:49:44,560 --> 00:49:53,693
But the sound went through Chaitanya and made a big sound there;

569
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:58,393
and "Shankha Chakra Gadaa Padma".

570
00:49:58,627 --> 00:50:02,393
Shankha, Chakra Gadaa, Padma are the weapons (of Vishnu) as you know.

571
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:08,360
All of them He took and came on His Garuda

572
00:50:08,760 --> 00:50:11,793
to save the chastity of His sister -

573
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:17,527
immediately, spontaneously, that moment.

574
00:50:17,793 --> 00:50:22,727
He could have said, "Alright let it be, let one sari come out then I'll go later."

575
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:30,660
I'm sure He must have stolen My saris which you give for My Pujas,

576
00:50:30,760 --> 00:50:32,593
which are too many!

577
00:50:32,927 --> 00:50:38,860
That's what I feel, that, from where did He get all these saris to give to Her?

578
00:50:39,493 --> 00:50:42,560
Must be from My own storage I'm sure,

579
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:44,793
and that's why you are giving Me so many saris,

580
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:48,860
so that He can save the chastity of many women.

581
00:50:52,593 --> 00:50:58,326
All this is so related, so connected, so one, so united.

582
00:50:58,360 --> 00:51:03,627
There's such a big drama going on but you can't see it.

583
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,293
But if you believe in yourself

584
00:51:09,727 --> 00:51:16,760
and if you really believe that you are a Sahaja Yogi,

585
00:51:17,693 --> 00:51:23,360
that: what are your qualities, what you are, what's your value is,

586
00:51:24,894 --> 00:51:30,860
then I'm sure you can become masters.

587
00:51:31,460 --> 00:51:35,393
But first of all we have no value of our realization.

588
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,560
We do not know what we are capable of, what we can do.

589
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:43,560
You still think, "oh, I was such an ordinary person,

590
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:47,360
Mother has given me realization. I have never been to university."

591
00:51:47,527 --> 00:51:49,393
Nobody has been to university.

592
00:51:53,660 --> 00:51:56,660
I mean, if you see, Rama never went to any university,

593
00:51:56,827 --> 00:51:59,460
Krishna never went into university,

594
00:51:59,560 --> 00:52:04,326
Christ never went to any university, an ordinary man, a son of a carpenter.

595
00:52:05,360 --> 00:52:09,527
But you are realized souls but you don't realize your worth and value.

596
00:52:09,927 --> 00:52:12,560
Once you realize it, you will just smile at everything.

597
00:52:12,660 --> 00:52:16,360
Because you don't know you are sitting on top of the world.

598
00:52:18,094 --> 00:52:21,326
Once you know that - only then your mastery will work.

599
00:52:21,360 --> 00:52:25,426
Otherwise imagine a master sitting under the foot of a disciple,

600
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,527
what will it look like?

601
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:30,860
But it's not that you dominate

602
00:52:31,393 --> 00:52:36,360
but you are in charge, absolutely in charge.

603
00:52:38,060 --> 00:52:41,593
You know everything, you know how to handle, you know how to manage.

604
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,426
This is the mastery you have to get.

605
00:52:44,693 --> 00:52:48,960
This is possible, absolutely possible, for all of you to do it.

606
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:51,727
But the first and foremost thing you have to know

607
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:54,360
is that we have to master ourselves.

608
00:52:55,293 --> 00:52:57,094
But then immediately people say

609
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,493
"Mother it's the most difficult to master yourself."

610
00:53:04,593 --> 00:53:06,593
I can't understand this.

611
00:53:07,727 --> 00:53:12,360
Why not? You try to master everyone, why can't you master yourself?

612
00:53:13,727 --> 00:53:18,660
Yourself is with you, you are with yourself, it's your own,

613
00:53:19,094 --> 00:53:24,894
it's your own property. You can correct the property of others,

614
00:53:25,027 --> 00:53:27,360
why can't you correct your own property?

615
00:53:28,793 --> 00:53:30,360
It should be the easiest thing to do

616
00:53:30,393 --> 00:53:33,460
but you're not sure that this is your own,

617
00:53:33,727 --> 00:53:37,393
you do not know that you are capable, but you are

618
00:53:37,693 --> 00:53:41,894
and now you have Self-knowledge, so why should you not do it?

619
00:53:43,326 --> 00:53:47,027
Why should you not try to watch yourself and see for yourself?

620
00:53:47,326 --> 00:53:53,360
And then you will know that you know all the tricks, the yukti.

621
00:53:55,426 --> 00:53:57,994
I don't have to tell you "do this, do that," nothing!

622
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,527
You yourself will know "ha, come along!"

623
00:54:02,860 --> 00:54:09,293
We know so many things, little things, about ordinary material things:

624
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:13,727
something's falling? Alright - put some support to it.

625
00:54:14,027 --> 00:54:16,994
This is happening? Put it that way.

626
00:54:17,627 --> 00:54:22,360
But in spiritual life it's the easiest thing

627
00:54:22,360 --> 00:54:25,760
because you are in the ocean of knowledge.

628
00:54:28,760 --> 00:54:31,827
But if you do not know that you are, in the ocean of knowledge,

629
00:54:32,326 --> 00:54:35,593
you will not know the tricks, of dealing with others.

630
00:54:35,860 --> 00:54:40,760
Because the main purpose of our communication is to emancipate

631
00:54:40,793 --> 00:54:43,693
the whole world, to emancipate them.

632
00:54:43,827 --> 00:54:46,660
To bring them out of their ignorance.

633
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:50,393
So for that we have to develop this mastery

634
00:54:52,727 --> 00:54:55,727
and not to get lost into nonsensical things

635
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,360
but this mastery has to be developed.

636
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:02,493
For that, meditation early in the morning is required

637
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:07,360
- to begin with. And then facing yourself

638
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:11,393
all the time, "Why did I say such a thing?"

639
00:55:11,727 --> 00:55:17,360
"Aah must be this. This is the word I picked up from that person."

640
00:55:19,493 --> 00:55:22,360
So when you start facing yourself, you will be surprised

641
00:55:22,426 --> 00:55:28,927
that you are trying to avoid the reality and just using your mind.

642
00:55:29,360 --> 00:55:33,593
See there, as I say, that this mind cheats you

643
00:55:33,827 --> 00:55:37,360
and tells you, "all right, forget it".

644
00:55:40,326 --> 00:55:42,994
And the last, but not the least,

645
00:55:43,660 --> 00:55:52,393
is that Shri Krishna is the one who is an expert of drama.

646
00:55:53,693 --> 00:56:02,360
He creates drama, He acts in the drama, and He's the spectator also.

647
00:56:04,360 --> 00:56:06,693
In these three forms you should see yourself.

648
00:56:07,027 --> 00:56:13,060
You create the drama of yourself, "aha this one now, see now,

649
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:16,527
how I'm acting here!"

650
00:56:16,960 --> 00:56:19,660
Then you become the spectator also.

651
00:56:20,094 --> 00:56:23,360
Become the spectator of your own dramas,

652
00:56:23,994 --> 00:56:28,426
then you will realize what you are doing,

653
00:56:29,326 --> 00:56:31,994
how you are working out everything.

654
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:38,360
Then the deception that we have, all the time, against ourselves,

655
00:56:39,326 --> 00:56:40,860
will just run away.

656
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:45,360
Because if an artist knows he's the spectator,

657
00:56:45,760 --> 00:56:49,360
if the one who is acting knows he is the spectator,

658
00:56:49,460 --> 00:56:54,360
he can never deceive himself, because He knows this is acting.

659
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:01,360
So this self-deception is the one [that] one should try to avoid -

660
00:57:01,827 --> 00:57:03,760
"let me face it."

661
00:57:04,360 --> 00:57:08,060
But also there is another way out, people find out.

662
00:57:08,360 --> 00:57:10,060
I mean, there are ways and ways.

663
00:57:10,493 --> 00:57:14,326
Like you tell somebody, "why didn't you write a letter?"

664
00:57:14,360 --> 00:57:16,693
"I know!" 'I know' means what?

665
00:57:17,527 --> 00:57:20,627
"But don't you think you should have written a letter to that person,

666
00:57:20,894 --> 00:57:24,360
who has done so much for you?" "I know."

667
00:57:26,827 --> 00:57:29,693
"But don't you think it's very bad and cruel on your part

668
00:57:29,760 --> 00:57:32,527
not to have written the letter?" "I know."

669
00:57:32,793 --> 00:57:38,727
'I know' means what? "I know I'm bad. I know I have been stupid.

670
00:57:38,860 --> 00:57:42,527
I know I should not have done it. But I know also that."

671
00:57:42,693 --> 00:57:44,693
So what next?

672
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,627
Because they think that if they have confessed that "I know," [it's] finished!

673
00:57:49,027 --> 00:57:52,293
So this is a new escape which was not [there] at the time of Shri Krishna,

674
00:57:52,426 --> 00:57:57,027
it's a new modern one, where people say "I know, alright so what?"

675
00:57:57,326 --> 00:58:02,960
"Ohhh alright I'm a sinner so what?" This is the second side of it.

676
00:58:03,393 --> 00:58:05,994
First of all "I know that I'm a sinner"

677
00:58:06,293 --> 00:58:12,360
and second is a higher state is that: "so what, what's wrong?"

678
00:58:12,994 --> 00:58:18,593
So this is how the derailment starts and one goes from one to another.

679
00:58:18,994 --> 00:58:23,660
If I know something then why shouldn't I correct myself?

680
00:58:26,627 --> 00:58:32,660
That's what it should be. "I know I'm like that I know it."

681
00:58:33,894 --> 00:58:38,360
If you know then you should also know the trick - how to get rid of it.

682
00:58:38,527 --> 00:58:43,693
Because you are detached from that personality about which you know,

683
00:58:44,094 --> 00:58:45,660
you can correct yourself.

684
00:58:45,860 --> 00:58:51,627
This is what yoga is, where all your attention is one with the Divine

685
00:58:52,094 --> 00:58:55,860
and you are so detached that you can see it.

686
00:58:56,360 --> 00:59:04,460
The attachment to all the things are finished

687
00:59:04,793 --> 00:59:09,460
and now the force that is coming to you is acting through you

688
00:59:09,527 --> 00:59:12,927
and acting on these attachments also.

689
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:21,493
The situation changes, absolutely, in Sahaja Yoga in a very different way,

690
00:59:21,727 --> 00:59:24,860
and if there is one bad Sahaja Yogi who comes in,

691
00:59:25,293 --> 00:59:27,860
either he's thrown out or he has to be alright.

692
00:59:28,460 --> 00:59:30,360
It's the other way around.

693
00:59:30,527 --> 00:59:33,727
Anyone who is a bad Sahaja Yogi, if he comes in Sahaja Yoga,

694
00:59:33,894 --> 00:59:37,360
then he has to be corrected, otherwise thrown out.

695
00:59:38,326 --> 00:59:43,527
It is a, I think, a more evolved state now

696
00:59:43,593 --> 00:59:48,426
than it was at the time of Shri Krishna, because He talked only to one, Arjuna.

697
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:51,493
Now I'm talking to thousands - this knowledge.

698
00:59:53,460 --> 00:59:57,593
That time He just talked about it at the time of war.

699
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,960
I'm talking at the time of peace.

700
01:00:00,894 --> 01:00:06,293
And it's much more evolved because Shri Krishna didn't give him realization.

701
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,827
But you have got the realization, you've got the knowledge,

702
01:00:09,894 --> 01:00:13,460
you know everything. You have all the subtle ideas.

703
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:18,960
So this is what it is today, as it is, the situation is that

704
01:00:19,060 --> 01:00:22,360
you have become part and parcel of Virata already.

705
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:24,360
You have not seen the Virata (as Arjuna did),

706
01:00:24,393 --> 01:00:26,560
but you are part and parcel of it.

707
01:00:27,360 --> 01:00:29,727
You are not watching it, you are inside it.

708
01:00:30,326 --> 01:00:36,960
So that anymore of not watching yourself,

709
01:00:37,727 --> 01:00:42,027
will be only thing that you'll be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

710
01:00:42,560 --> 01:00:47,960
Or else you better watch yourself and correct yourself

711
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:51,460
and be one with the body of the Virata.

712
01:00:52,593 --> 01:00:55,560
This is the sign of a Yogeshwara,

713
01:00:55,827 --> 01:01:00,860
and that's how you have to be, in a mood which is very smiling,

714
01:01:01,493 --> 01:01:05,027
knowing everything and not sarcastic,

715
01:01:05,627 --> 01:01:12,060
but [with a] very paternal smile, very loving, affectionate smile,

716
01:01:12,360 --> 01:01:15,527
that you should have for all the other people

717
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:17,994
and immediately they'll recognize.

718
01:01:18,293 --> 01:01:21,360
I have seen small children are like that.

719
01:01:21,894 --> 01:01:24,527
They are extremely patronising sometimes, you know.

720
01:01:24,560 --> 01:01:26,527
They see their parents and this and that.

721
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:32,560
So they come and tell you that, "don't worry everything will be all right,

722
01:01:32,627 --> 01:01:35,627
after all God is there to look after you."

723
01:01:37,460 --> 01:01:43,293
And they can be extremely loving and kind and the way they talk

724
01:01:43,393 --> 01:01:45,360
they will neutralize the whole thing.

725
01:01:45,527 --> 01:01:48,360
So we have to learn a lot from our children,

726
01:01:48,560 --> 01:01:51,360
from all the little babies that we have

727
01:01:51,493 --> 01:01:58,360
and that we ourselves should have that Ganesha principal within us,

728
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:00,994
with innocence we should work it out.

729
01:02:01,360 --> 01:02:05,027
Innocence is the most intelligent thing and most effective thing.

730
01:02:05,627 --> 01:02:09,460
So I would request you, all of you, to face yourself

731
01:02:10,293 --> 01:02:12,960
and don't hate yourself but correct yourself,

732
01:02:13,293 --> 01:02:17,360
respect yourself and try to evolve your own glory.

733
01:02:17,493 --> 01:02:20,527
May God bless you.
