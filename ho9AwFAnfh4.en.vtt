00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.190
Today is the nineteenth Sahasrara Day.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.990
If you count the first one the day the Sahasrara was opened.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.710
I'll have to tell..

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.110
I'll have to tell you the story

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:29.510
about the Sahasrara day,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:36.790
about which it was decided, long time back,

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:43.230
before I incarnated.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.950
They had a big meeting in the heavens,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:01.390
all the thirty-five crores (3.5 million)

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:09.070
of Gods, the deities were there present

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.110
to decide what is to be done.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:24.110
This is the ultimate that we have to give to human beings,

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.030
is to open their Sahasrara;

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.350
to open their awareness to the Spirit;

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:47.270
to the real knowledge of the Divine.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:55.190
To remove the darkness of ignorance,

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.470
and it had to be spontaneously,

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.910
because it has to work - the living force of God.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.430
Also it had to be very quick.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.230
So all the Gods requested that now,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.550
I, the Adi Shakti, has to take the birth.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.990
They all tried their best.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.270
They did whatever was possible,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.830
the saints were made by them, but very few.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.950
They incarnated and people made religions out of them

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.350
which were perverted - brought them bad name.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.670
No reality in those religions.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.790
These religions were money oriented

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:07.430
or power oriented.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:13.910
There was no Divine force working, actually it was all anti-divine.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:20.070
How to now turn human beings

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:28.230
away from these superficial religions,

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:34.270
these perverted paths of destruction.

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:40.110
How to tell them about all these established organisations.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.550
For ages they have been ruling,

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.190
making money, making power.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.550
It was a tremendous task,

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:01.670
had to be done with great patience and the love.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:05.950
It was a very delicate work also,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.270
because they believed in those religions,

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.990
innocent people, simple people.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.110
To blast them that this is all nonsense,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.670
UNCLEAR (they/there) are no religions,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:22.830
they are against incarnations, against all the prophets,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:25.550
against all the saints.

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:28.430
That's why all the real saints had to suffer.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:34.390
It's a powerful work that was to be done,

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.790
and that's why Adi Shakti had to take birth on this earth.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.350
It had to be before the sixth of May

00:04:47.510 --> 00:04:53.510
because sixth of May was the doomsday in that year.

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.870
It was done on the fifth of May at the nick of time.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.030
It was all decided beforehand,

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:12.550
and every deity's job was allotted to all of them.

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.670
Very efficient deities, very obedient,

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:24.510
they knew me very well.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:29.430
Completely dedicated and devoted.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:34.830
They knew me very very well,

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:38.950
every end of my hair, they knew.

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.910
I didn't have to teach them protocol,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:49.550
love itself gives you protocol

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.750
but love that is Divine, is not selfish love.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.910
It's not the way we love my child, my husband,

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:04.110
my country, my clothes.

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:07.950
It is the love

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:12.670
which is Divine,

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:22.390
which spreads from your heart,

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.150
from your Spirit,

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:31.230
like the light of knowledge.

00:06:34.750 --> 00:06:37.390
What a tremendous task it was.

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:42.790
So I said, at Sahasrara

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.510
I had to be Mahamaya.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:53.470
I had to be Mahamaya. I had to be something

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:56.790
that people can't recognise me easily.

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:01.150
But deities know!

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.270
This Mahamaya had to come on this earth,

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:11.110
not the Adi Shakti in her purest form, it's too much.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:17.430
So she was covered with this Mahamaya.

00:07:21.350 --> 00:07:22.910
Now you see,

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.110
in nineteen years what we have achieved.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:37.350
So many yogis are sitting before me.

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:42.270
The difference between

00:07:42.710 --> 00:07:47.070
a saint and a yogi is

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.790
that a saint himself is righteous,

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.190
himself is holy,

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:07.070
but he doesn't know much about the Kundalini.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:14.790
But the yogi knows about the Kundalini.

00:08:15.230 --> 00:08:20.270
But the difference between a yogi and a Sahaja Yogini -

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:25.990
Sahaja Yogi, is that a Sahaja Yogi has powers.

00:08:26.990 --> 00:08:31.990
A Sahaja Yogini has powers to give realisation to others.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:40.110
A yogi can cleanse himself but he cannot cleanse others,

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:48.430
while a Sahaja Yogi can cleanse others and cleanse himself.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:52.910
So this is the superior most state

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:58.070
which you achieved through your

00:08:59.110 --> 00:09:01.350
great punyas I should say.

00:09:02.150 --> 00:09:06.670
So many of you have been searching the truth in previous lives,

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:13.030
and now here you are to achieve

00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:16.070
what you have been searching for.

00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:21.910
All that has happened now, so beautifully.

00:09:22.910 --> 00:09:25.990
You are not even aware what has happened to you.

00:09:27.350 --> 00:09:28.950
Automatically,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.510
spontaneously you have got the powers

00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.710
within your central nervous system in a split of a second.

00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:42.790
Your attention has been fixed now.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:47.670
Of course even now some people don't have.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:52.870
Even now I see the attention wobbles.

00:09:55.910 --> 00:10:01.110
But so many of you have achieved that state as he was saying,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:04.990
Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham, Shivo'ham. You have it.

00:10:06.630 --> 00:10:09.950
What Adi Shankaracharya has described about himself,

00:10:10.270 --> 00:10:15.270
you can say that about all of you.

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:20.230
So many Adi Shankaracharyas sitting before Me.

00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:27.510
But still I am a Mahamaya.

00:10:29.430 --> 00:10:31.190
I just behave like you,

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:35.110
I too have a family,

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:41.430
I too have children which can be called as mine,

00:10:42.630 --> 00:10:44.990
and you are my children too.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:49.910
So when you are mature enough

00:10:50.910 --> 00:10:55.230
the first sign is that you get discretion.

00:10:56.230 --> 00:11:00.750
That Divine discretion is love, again.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.870
But I see people falter. They don't mind saying

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.390
"Mother, I am catching on my Agnya."

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.190
Why? You know how to cleanse it.

00:11:16.310 --> 00:11:18.270
You know what to do about it.

00:11:19.150 --> 00:11:22.870
Why don't you clear it? Why don't you get to it?

00:11:23.510 --> 00:11:26.343
What is the thing? The Maya.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:34.270
But we are Sahaja Yogis and we have our Sahaj culture.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:39.430
We live with our culture, proud of it, and this is our religion.

00:11:40.510 --> 00:11:44.270
We have our pure religion on which we thrive,

00:11:44.790 --> 00:11:47.070
we're not going to change.

00:11:47.630 --> 00:11:50.070
Ourselves we are going to change the whole world.

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.590
We have a culture of our own

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:55.710
and we are going to behave in that manner

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.390
which is going to change the whole world.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.630
This is our responsibility.

00:12:01.950 --> 00:12:04.350
You are chosen for this work.

00:12:04.750 --> 00:12:09.070
You are the real chosen ones. You are the real pure ones.

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:12.790
You are the ones who have established the kalisthan.

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:22.270
Be aware of it, of your responsibility.

00:12:22.990 --> 00:12:26.310
Be aware of your powers.

00:12:26.950 --> 00:12:30.790
The greatest power that you have is of Divine love,

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:33.790
not the stupid love that blinds you

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.310
and that you fall in love, but you rise in love.

00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:44.910
The way we talk, the way we walk, the way we live,

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:47.830
the way we behave.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:51.910
Everything has to be Sahaj.

00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:57.150
And it is such a real, living culture

00:12:58.350 --> 00:13:02.550
of beautiful people in the world.

00:13:04.070 --> 00:13:06.270
We see in the animals

00:13:06.830 --> 00:13:13.150
in the birds; we see a swan, it's described.

00:13:14.350 --> 00:13:18.790
among animals the elephant, which has the wisdom.

00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:24.030
The swan that knows how to separate water from milk.

00:13:27.703 --> 00:13:32.383
Then among human beings, Sahaja Yogis.

00:13:32.783 --> 00:13:35.623
Today, in these modern times,

00:13:36.263 --> 00:13:40.703
I think by the time it is twenty-one years

00:13:42.023 --> 00:13:47.943
we will be all very well established, matured,

00:13:50.863 --> 00:13:53.423
wonderful Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:53.823 --> 00:13:58.463
pulling out this mad world from it's ignorance and from it's Maya.

00:13:59.023 --> 00:14:01.583
We'll be that powerful people of love,

00:14:01.943 --> 00:14:04.703
of understanding, of discretion

00:14:05.543 --> 00:14:08.223
and of humility.

00:14:08.583 --> 00:14:13.063
I would like to see those days in my lifetime.

00:14:13.743 --> 00:14:17.943
I hope you will give me full assistance.

00:14:19.381 --> 00:14:20.820
You have to know

00:14:21.021 --> 00:14:27.460
there's only one point was fixed in this meeting of the Devas

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.828
and that I cannot overcome.

00:14:33.101 --> 00:14:36.540
They said " we'll tolerate any nonsense

00:14:36.741 --> 00:14:38.740
because they are coming from ignorance,

00:14:38.941 --> 00:14:41.701
but anybody who doesn't love You

00:14:41.941 --> 00:14:44.101
anybody who insults You,

00:14:44.381 --> 00:14:46.781
anybody who takes advantage of You

00:14:47.101 --> 00:14:48.821
anybody who exploits You,

00:14:49.141 --> 00:14:53.741
anybody who shows lack of protocol,

00:14:55.021 --> 00:14:59.821
anybody who doesn't recognise you, we'll hit them hard,

00:15:00.101 --> 00:15:02.941
and that permission You must give us,

00:15:03.301 --> 00:15:05.101
otherwise we are not for this work".

00:15:05.661 --> 00:15:08.701
They formed a union against Me.

00:15:12.741 --> 00:15:14.941
And I had to give in.

00:15:15.221 --> 00:15:19.021
And be very careful, I tell you, don't touch me, be careful.

00:15:19.381 --> 00:15:21.861
Some people just try to put my sari right.

00:15:22.061 --> 00:15:25.341
You're not to do that, don't have to do that.

00:15:27.381 --> 00:15:29.861
Don't play with my money,

00:15:30.741 --> 00:15:36.461
don't take my hospitality, be careful.

00:15:36.901 --> 00:15:40.421
I tell you as much as I can,

00:15:41.941 --> 00:15:43.541
and this is what it is.

00:15:43.941 --> 00:15:47.861
One side is Mahamaya, another side these deities,

00:15:48.101 --> 00:15:50.701
and poor Sahaja Yogis in between.

00:15:55.741 --> 00:15:58.901
I sympathise with you, I know

00:15:59.581 --> 00:16:02.301
but you better be careful.

00:16:02.621 --> 00:16:05.341
It's a razor's edge I think, of course,

00:16:05.821 --> 00:16:07.981
but otherwise it's wonderful.

00:16:09.741 --> 00:16:15.581
If these two things, if you know, that this is Mahamaya

00:16:16.461 --> 00:16:20.141
and that the deities are around sitting now here, all of them,

00:16:20.421 --> 00:16:24.981
peering into you, all of them,

00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:28.181
judging you, having a big meeting there. Who's who?

00:16:28.661 --> 00:16:31.621
Where is the attention of this gentleman? Where is he looking?

00:16:32.661 --> 00:16:36.341
What is he doing? They are all sitting here.

00:16:38.581 --> 00:16:43.541
But at the same time they are flowers, Divine flowers,

00:16:43.901 --> 00:16:48.981
Divine blessings and all the angels are just going round,

00:16:49.261 --> 00:16:53.101
I can see them. Your cameras can catch them.

00:16:53.461 --> 00:16:56.501
You've got photographs that will show you all of them sitting.

00:16:57.461 --> 00:17:02.861
And it's already predicted that the whole world will

00:17:03.101 --> 00:17:06.021
come down at the Lotus Feet of your Mother,

00:17:06.301 --> 00:17:11.741
and that you will decide the future of this world.

00:17:12.021 --> 00:17:14.741
It is written already, fourteen-thousand years back,

00:17:15.061 --> 00:17:17.941
and there's another one who's prophesizing the same.

00:17:29.541 --> 00:17:31.941
So you have to be aware.

00:17:32.941 --> 00:17:35.381
Where is your attention?

00:17:42.101 --> 00:17:44.541
What are you worried about?

00:17:44.941 --> 00:17:47.901
Where are you spending your time?

00:17:49.101 --> 00:17:51.821
Leave your children to me.

00:17:53.221 --> 00:17:55.661
Leave your families to me.

00:17:56.221 --> 00:17:58.981
You can only keep your purse,

00:18:01.101 --> 00:18:04.021
but the rest of it,

00:18:05.941 --> 00:18:08.661
you can leave all your headaches to Me.

00:18:10.301 --> 00:18:13.821
But don't play tricks with Me.

00:18:15.861 --> 00:18:22.021
Mahamaya knows all your tricks, everything, in and out.

00:18:23.301 --> 00:18:26.821
If I want to know, I can know each and everything about you.

00:18:27.381 --> 00:18:30.061
I don't want to know.

00:18:33.941 --> 00:18:37.301
Under these circumstances

00:18:39.261 --> 00:18:43.381
we are supported, looked after,

00:18:45.261 --> 00:18:50.101
managed, taken to reality so easily,

00:18:50.941 --> 00:18:54.661
so much, with care.

00:18:55.127 --> 00:18:57.260
You tell me "Mother, suddenly I went there

00:18:57.461 --> 00:19:00.101
and what do I find, Sahaja Yogis sitting there.

00:19:00.621 --> 00:19:03.341
And we wanted to know someone. He was just there.

00:19:03.701 --> 00:19:05.661
How is it?"

00:19:09.541 --> 00:19:12.821
You are assisted.

00:19:13.101 --> 00:19:16.741
Here these Prime Ministers have only five, six bodyguards,

00:19:17.021 --> 00:19:22.141
you have millions and millions, each one of you, with you.

00:19:23.861 --> 00:19:28.021
Nobody can touch you except for you can harm yourself that's all.

00:19:28.501 --> 00:19:30.461
Nobody can harm you.

00:19:31.221 --> 00:19:35.541
So today, again a day of great determination,

00:19:37.141 --> 00:19:39.101
and taking a vow

00:19:39.381 --> 00:19:44.661
that for us, our ascent is the only concern,

00:19:45.467 --> 00:19:49.587
is the only idea, nothing else,

00:19:50.547 --> 00:19:52.347
and it will work out.

00:19:52.907 --> 00:19:56.427
All the rest will be taken care of.

00:19:57.187 --> 00:19:59.587
You have all the mechanics to do that,

00:20:00.027 --> 00:20:04.707
but first give it to the mechanics to work out.

00:20:05.107 --> 00:20:07.747
All will work in a reflex action.

00:20:08.147 --> 00:20:11.267
Clear, clear out your chakras.

00:20:11.827 --> 00:20:14.307
Don't say "I have this, I have that." Just clear out.

00:20:14.627 --> 00:20:17.227
"How dare I have all these problems."

00:20:17.827 --> 00:20:20.907
How dare I have all these chakras still lingering.

00:20:21.427 --> 00:20:25.947
Clear out, morning, evening. Clear out.

00:20:30.547 --> 00:20:32.267
I'm sure it will work out.

00:20:32.547 --> 00:20:37.067
Next year I hope I'll have some good news.

00:20:37.987 --> 00:20:39.679
May God Bless You.
