Christmas Puja, Ganapatipule (India),
25 December 2003.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:08.613
Today is a great day because we are celebrating

00:00:08.862 --> 00:00:13.780
the birth of Jesus Christ.

00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:25.696
He was such a great spiritual personality,

00:00:27.904 --> 00:00:33.655
who had to suffer on the cross.

00:00:35.946 --> 00:00:40.363
This is what many people don't understand,

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:47.321
that why a man of his calibre, of his standing,

00:00:48.655 --> 00:00:50.780
of his spirituality,

00:00:51.613 --> 00:00:56.738
should have to go through so many ordeals in life.

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:06.238
It is very easy to understand

00:01:07.321 --> 00:01:10.904
that he was born in a circumstances

00:01:12.112 --> 00:01:14.530
which was against him,

00:01:15.112 --> 00:01:19.613
which were against divine force.

00:01:21.238 --> 00:01:31.112
So to overcome that people tried to destroy Jesus Christ.

00:01:34.112 --> 00:01:39.738
And he did not feel the pain,

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:44.821
he didn't feel the absurdity of those people.

00:01:46.112 --> 00:01:51.029
On the contrary he went through all that ordeal

00:01:52.112 --> 00:01:56.238
with such courage and such dignity.

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.530
So for us, what is there to see is

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:10.321
that if you are divine

00:02:10.613 --> 00:02:14.112
and if you have powers of divinity,

00:02:15.446 --> 00:02:21.530
then you should have courage,

00:02:22.655 --> 00:02:26.655
and with that courage you can face all kinds of ordeals.

00:02:27.946 --> 00:02:34.154
On the whole, whenever you are on this earth

00:02:35.154 --> 00:02:38.655
there are problems of different types.

00:02:39.738 --> 00:02:42.738
You may belong to royal families,

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:46.238
or may be a poor person,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.738
there are always problems facing you.

00:02:54.821 --> 00:03:00.321
But Christ has shown by his life

00:03:00.738 --> 00:03:03.321
that though he had to suffer so much,

00:03:04.655 --> 00:03:08.029
he was so patient and courageous.

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:13.946
His life has given us an example,

00:03:14.238 --> 00:03:19.363
what we should be, how we should behave

00:03:20.029 --> 00:03:26.238
when we are facing problems because of ignorance of people.

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:36.446
But today is a happy day because it is his birth date

00:03:36.738 --> 00:03:39.946
and we are all celebrating

00:03:40.238 --> 00:03:44.446
because he has shown us a new path of spirituality

00:03:45.363 --> 00:03:47.738
in which one has to suffer,

00:03:49.071 --> 00:03:54.238
because of the ignorance of many who are there,

00:03:54.571 --> 00:03:57.071
he suffered so much.

00:03:57.363 --> 00:03:59.655
But today it's not so bad,

00:03:59.946 --> 00:04:06.571
people understand spirituality and divinity.

00:04:07.862 --> 00:04:10.446
And you are so many together now.

00:04:14.946 --> 00:04:22.071
In these sufferings Christ never cried or wept.

00:04:23.862 --> 00:04:29.946
He went through it in a very resolute manner.

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:34.946
So what we have to learn from his life is

00:04:35.279 --> 00:04:37.738
that we should not be afraid.

00:04:38.363 --> 00:04:42.862
Whatever might be happening to us,

00:04:43.154 --> 00:04:45.363
we should not be afraid.

00:04:45.655 --> 00:04:47.946
But times have changed

00:04:48.279 --> 00:04:51.446
and people don't torture anyone

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:54.446
because of your spirituality.

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.780
It's not there, it's finished.

00:04:59.071 --> 00:05:04.780
Christ wiped out all that from human minds,

00:05:05.071 --> 00:05:09.071
and people respect you for being spiritual.

00:05:10.363 --> 00:05:14.780
This is the message of Christ's life,

00:05:15.071 --> 00:05:19.655
and we all should be very happy

00:05:20.987 --> 00:05:27.571
that he has shown us this path of ignorance.

00:05:32.154 --> 00:05:36.363
The message of Sahaja Yoga is the same:

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:42.488
that you take your realisation,

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:46.071
you take to spiritual life,

00:05:46.363 --> 00:05:49.071
and everything will work out

00:05:49.363 --> 00:05:52.987
because all the divine forces are with you.

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:56.987
They are working out everything for you

00:05:57.279 --> 00:06:02.279
and you are so many who can say that you have witnessed it.

00:06:04.279 --> 00:06:08.279
So this kind of life that Christ had,

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:12.196
you don't have to go through, he has done for us.

00:06:13.488 --> 00:06:20.571
Your life will be very, very safe and peaceful and joyous.

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:24.780
That is without my telling you,

00:06:25.071 --> 00:06:27.363
you must have experience.

00:06:29.696 --> 00:06:32.780
These days there are also very cruel people,

00:06:33.071 --> 00:06:37.987
very absurd and extremely aggressive,

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:43.488
but still, no-one can harm you.

00:06:43.904 --> 00:06:46.488
Life has become very different.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.571
And we thank Christ that he has gone through all that

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:57.279
to save us from those ordeals.

00:07:05.488 --> 00:07:10.987
Today is the birthday of Christ and

00:07:11.279 --> 00:07:16.196
we are all celebrating His birthday with great joy.

00:07:16.488 --> 00:07:24.196
And we also know  that Jesus Christ took a lot of efforts,

00:07:24.488 --> 00:07:28.696
and we do not have such efforts as much as He has done.

00:07:28.904 --> 00:07:31.196
But how much Jesus Christ has suffered...We know this.

00:07:31.488 --> 00:07:33.987
But we do not have this kind of efforts,

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:39.112
because the whole human community has changed.

00:07:39.404 --> 00:07:44.404
And in this changed human community,

00:07:44.696 --> 00:07:50.904
spiritual life is very, very important.

00:07:51.404 --> 00:07:58.112
From this spiritual life  many obstacles have been removed,

00:07:58.404 --> 00:08:02.987
from this we can solve our physical problems,

00:08:07.279 --> 00:08:10.987
we can solve our mental problems,

00:08:11.279 --> 00:08:15.987
we can solve household problems,

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:18.404
we can solve the problems of the whole world.

00:08:18.696 --> 00:08:23.780
In this way the life of the whole mankind

00:08:24.112 --> 00:08:26.987
can be changed into a spiritual life.

00:08:28.321 --> 00:08:31.404
This is very important for us to know,

00:08:31.696 --> 00:08:34.987
that on the  one hand there was Jesus Christ

00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:37.696
who had gained a lot in spirituality,

00:08:37.987 --> 00:08:43.904
and on the other hand we have

00:08:44.196 --> 00:08:49.112
gained a small part of spirituality

00:08:49.404 --> 00:08:52.613
- and because of us the world is becoming silent.

00:08:52.904 --> 00:08:59.987
Many problems are getting solved

00:09:00.321 --> 00:09:04.029
and mankind has understood

00:09:04.321 --> 00:09:07.029
that it's very important to take to spiritual life.

00:09:07.321 --> 00:09:11.696
This kind of changes are because of you people,

00:09:12.029 --> 00:09:14.530
I alone cannot do anything.

00:09:14.696 --> 00:09:19.321
I am in the same situation as Jesus.

00:09:19.613 --> 00:09:25.196
To what extent can I act?

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.196
Now there are many people.

00:09:29.530 --> 00:09:34.321
Now we can see

00:09:35.196 --> 00:09:43.696
how the whole world has changed.

00:09:44.029 --> 00:09:48.404
Because of you, problems are getting solved,

00:09:49.404 --> 00:09:55.904
many changes have come,

00:09:56.238 --> 00:10:02.904
Many changes are coming,

00:10:03.238 --> 00:10:09.404
not only for one person,

00:10:10.738 --> 00:10:15.404
for thousands, for the whole world,

00:10:16.112 --> 00:10:18.738
in the whole community changes are coming.

00:10:19.029 --> 00:10:25.112
These things you are all doing, which is very important.

00:10:30.904 --> 00:10:36.112
Now to speak in Marathi, the life of Christ was very sad.

00:10:36.404 --> 00:10:48.112
But he did all this kind of things with love,

00:10:48.446 --> 00:10:53.446
because He was a very great soul

00:10:53.738 --> 00:11:04.112
- such a kind of person does not feel any kind of sadness.

00:11:04.446 --> 00:11:08.613
In this way we have taken to spiritual life,

00:11:08.946 --> 00:11:13.446
and now we have to give the spiritual life to everyone.

00:11:13.738 --> 00:11:18.613
People are watching our lives and  they are stunned  by seeing

00:11:18.946 --> 00:11:20.613
how happy we are.

00:11:21.238 --> 00:11:24.613
And when they understand that

00:11:24.946 --> 00:11:27.112
these things are happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:11:27.446 --> 00:11:29.530
they also enter Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:29.821 --> 00:11:32.530
This is a very good thing

00:11:32.821 --> 00:11:35.530
and also you have got this blessing.

00:11:35.821 --> 00:11:37.821
And you have to keep this blessing very carefully.

00:11:38.154 --> 00:11:41.154
You have to work on it, and the most important

00:11:41.446 --> 00:11:47.238
thing is that you have to give this thing to everyone.

00:11:47.530 --> 00:11:51.821
You all are getting this kind of blessing

00:11:52.154 --> 00:11:56.655
- now let also other people have this kind of joy,

00:11:56.946 --> 00:12:02.029
and so all the Sahaja Yogis have to try

00:12:03.321 --> 00:12:06.655
to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone.

00:12:07.946 --> 00:12:12.154
In the whole world Sahaja yoga has spread but it is very little.

00:12:12.446 --> 00:12:14.154
It should be spread much more.

00:12:14.446 --> 00:12:20.363
Jesus Christ had only twelve devotees,

00:12:20.655 --> 00:12:26.029
and these twelve devotees had spread Christianity

00:12:26.363 --> 00:12:31.154
- but there are many mistakes made.

00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:34.530
In this way you have to bear in mind that

00:12:34.862 --> 00:12:40.530
when we spread Sahaja Yoga we should not make any mistake.

00:12:40.862 --> 00:12:47.946
We should spread it in a very simple way. It is not so difficult.

00:12:48.238 --> 00:12:49.738
In this thing,

00:12:50.238 --> 00:12:56.946
Parameshwara has given you the Shakti

00:12:57.238 --> 00:13:00.946
and the brains, use it. I have full faith in you,

00:13:01.154 --> 00:13:03.946
that you can make many Sahaja Yogis

00:13:04.238 --> 00:13:07.655
and you should try to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:13:07.946 --> 00:13:12.862
and only think day and night who to give Sahaja Yoga to.

00:13:13.154 --> 00:13:17.363
I am blessing you for this,

00:13:17.655 --> 00:13:19.571
so this is a very big responsibility on you.

00:13:19.862 --> 00:13:22.363
Since you took to Sahaja Yoga, you had this responsibility,

00:13:22.655 --> 00:13:24.946
that from today you have to bear in mind

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:28.571
that you have to give Sahaja Yoga to everyone

00:13:28.780 --> 00:13:30.571
and should not keep this thing just within us.

00:13:30.862 --> 00:13:34.446
May God bless you
