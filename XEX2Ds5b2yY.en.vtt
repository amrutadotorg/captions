00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.320
If Rama came to be the greatest example of kingship,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.440
of fatherhood

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.200
and who gave society a tremendous base upon which to

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.920
establish the quality of dharma and family life,

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.999
then there had to be a power to sustain.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.200
That power was none other than Radha, than Sita.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:36.800
If Lord Krishna came to do the job of establishing within us

00:00:36.999 --> 00:00:40.240
the potential consciousness

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.640
that we have to become the witness to the [drama] of life,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.040
that we have to recognize the nature of the all-pervading God,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:57.240
that we have to recognize the greatness of God

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.200
and that He has to watch His play,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.440
and that we have to be like Him

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.240
and watch that play rather than become involved in it.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.080
If Shri Krishna came on the Earth

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.880
to establish the quality of divine diplomacy within us,

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:17.040
that we have to be sweet, that we have to,

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.880
in order to convince people have a certain essence of truth,

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.480
you may have to go about it in different ways, at different levels,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.160
all of those sweet things that we know from Bhagavat Gita.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.000
There had to be a power to sustain. That power was Radha.

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:41.480
If Christ came to open the narrow gate,

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.480
if He came to absorb and dissolve and neutralize our ego,

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.999
He said: “I have died for your sins”.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.280
This means that He absorbs all of the wrong doings of the past

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.999
at the time of self Realization.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.000
If He came to be resurrected, to prove that the Spirit is eternal,

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.760
how did He do it, how did He go through the drama?

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:10.880
He was sustained again

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.240
by the power of his Mother,

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.999
who was none other than the primordial Mother Herself,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:19.200
as the Mother Mary.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.920
So through the eternity of time, as the Mother of the Buddha,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:31.880
as the wife of Hazrat Ali who was the husband of Fatima,

00:02:31.999 --> 00:02:34.880
She incarnated at that time

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.480
to do that job of providing the sustaining force.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.999
But now what has happened today

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.999
is that same [Thy] has taken birth as a Mother,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:52.999
to give us what Christ promised, our second birth.

00:02:53.999 --> 00:02:59.240
The age of the father was an age of rough, of stern supervision.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.080
The age of the son, Christ,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.999
was the age of nourishment, yes, but nourishment in the sense of

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.160
setting that quality of Sonship,

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.440
forgiveness, sacrifice

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.880
and slowly introducing the concept of the Mother.

00:03:17.999 --> 00:03:19.999
And the final age of the Holy Ghost

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:25.999
spoken of by Joachim del Fiore and many other Catholic mystics.

00:03:26.999 --> 00:03:30.240
The age of the Holy Ghost is now.

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:35.760
And the one to do the job has to be none other than a Mother,

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.360
the same Primordial Mother as has been incarnating

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.999
over the eternity of time.

00:03:42.999 --> 00:03:47.880
So Shri Mataji is here for one job.

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:50.080
She is here to awaken within you

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.440
that pure desire to be one with God.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:57.040
That residual energy

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.080
which is sleeping,

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.960
but which in the presence of Her, or another realized soul,

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.999
awakens spontaneously and effortlessly and without any pain,

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:14.480
and gives you what you have been seeking for so many births.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.400
The time has come. Mother uses the phrase that

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.920
on the Tree of Life, at first there were just a few flowers.

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.960
Now the blossom time has come.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.760
And all of those blossoms have to turn to fruit.

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:35.760
And this is why we are here. The fruiting is self Realization,

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:38.999
but it has to actualize, it has to happen.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.040
So when it happens,

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.480
it manifests as I explained to you as these cool vibrations.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.880
When you feel these cool vibrations,

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.999
you then are empowered with the all-pervading power of God.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.480
You can raise your own Kundalini, you can balance the energies,

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.840
you can clear the chakras in yourself and in others.

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:02.320
Through the collective consciousness that happens

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.440
you can know which center within you

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.320
is clear and which one is a little bit obstructed.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.320
And you know in other people.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.320
You can work it out in yourself, you can work it out in others.

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:16.960
You can give the blessing to others.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.880
As you get it, you can give it to others.

00:05:19.999 --> 00:05:23.880
So it's a tremendous leap forward in our evolutionary cycle.

00:05:23.999 --> 00:05:28.120
So from this limited, human awareness

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.320
we are now moving ahead

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:32.880
into a new dimension,

00:05:32.999 --> 00:05:36.999
which has been promised, by all of the great incarnations.

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.200
You become a Spiritual being.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:45.840
So on this last night, here in New York,

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:48.920
all of you should be absolutely in the mood of,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:50.920
"I have to get something",

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:54.240
but not only get something, because most of you have got it,

00:05:54.440 --> 00:06:00.040
but you have to as if “suck" those vibrations into your being,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.160
into the very being which is this subtle body that lies within you.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.880
Allow these centers to purify and to cleanse.

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:12.240
Allow the Kundalini to come up with greater and greater force.

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.400
And allow yourself to enjoy all of the blessings

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.720
of being one with the Spirit. Thank you very much.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:24.480
And may I introduce you to again, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.999
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:06:54.999 --> 00:06:59.999
As Dr. Warren has told you, that the blossom time has come.

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:06.760
You could never have found so many seekers,

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.999
on this Earth,

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:13.120
say even before 50 years.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.080
Suddenly so many seekers have been born,

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.880
who are seeking something beyond.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:29.080
They are not satisfied with rationality,

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.480
with materialism, with all the ideologies given

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:40.720
by the people who talk that that we should be satisfied

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.760
with ourselves

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.760
as far as matter goes

00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:52.080
or as far as mental projection is concerned.

00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.280
They want to know that there must be something beyond.

00:07:57.999 --> 00:08:02.000
And thus we find

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.240
there is a great

00:08:06.999 --> 00:08:11.160
shopping center that has opened especially in your country,

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:15.280
of all those people who think they can surprise us.

00:08:15.999 --> 00:08:19.280
That is one of the signs which were described even by Christ.

00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:21.280
Of course in our country,

00:08:21.480 --> 00:08:23.999
there are books and books written

00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:27.120
about those people who will come here

00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:32.200
as fake people and take full advantage of your seeking.

00:08:32.800 --> 00:08:39.600
Now the problem with the Western mind is this,

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:43.999
that it does not understand the dangers

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.480
of getting into all kinds of things,

00:08:47.999 --> 00:08:53.120
and that is why they are really

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.240
[led] into things

00:08:55.999 --> 00:08:58.280
where they should not have been.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:00.880
And they have no knowledge also,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.960
in a way what to expect

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.240
of themselves.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:13.840
When they are seeking, what should be expected?

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.200
What should happen to us?

00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:20.999
What is the criteria that we are realized souls?

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:27.999
Which is the way we can find out that we have got our Realization?

00:09:29.999 --> 00:09:36.040
As it is, there is so much of book-knowledge, the worst,

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:39.840
as Shankaracharya calls as, calls it shabda jaalam,

00:09:39.999 --> 00:09:41.760
the net of worse.

00:09:41.999 --> 00:09:44.840
And people were lost in those words.

00:09:44.999 --> 00:09:47.999
The books are there, the words are there,

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:51.160
and the people start thinking that

00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:56.200
by reading these books or by understanding them mentally,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:59.240
or some of them think by remembering by heart,

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.480
they will achieve their Realization.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:09.360
That means Realization is only for people, who are able to read.

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:12.999
And what about the people who cannot read?

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.280
Are they not going to evolve?

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:16.999
Perhaps they are going to evolve much faster

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:18.999
than the people who can read.

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:21.880
Because they have no complications in their heads.

00:10:21.999 --> 00:10:24.200
They are simple, straight forward people.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.999
I've seen the example of that in India.

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.720
Not only that, but they are very sensitive.

00:10:29.999 --> 00:10:31.720
It's because they live with the Mother Earth

00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:32.960
They are extremely sensitive.

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.880
They know a tug, they know a cheat,

00:10:36.999 --> 00:10:39.960
they know a hypocrite and they know the reality.

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.999
While where people live with artificialities,

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.880
with artificial love,

00:10:45.999 --> 00:10:48.040
it's impossible for them to judge,

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.000
what is real and what is artificial.

00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:55.760
As I told you before, that minimum of minimum,

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:59.999
you must cancel all the people who live on your money.

00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.280
They are parasites, in simple words.

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.400
Or they may be your servants.

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:08.040
But they cannot be the people who can deliver the goods.

00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:11.720
If they are poor, they live like poor people.

00:11:11.999 --> 00:11:15.999
If they are rich, they live there, but absolutely detached.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:21.160
Now, what should we expect?

00:11:21.999 --> 00:11:24.040
What should happen to us,

00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:27.760
when we say that "I have got Realization".

00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.320
This is the point people do not know they are not educated in that.

00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.320
They are naive about it,

00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:40.000
and that's why people have taken full advantage of their ignorance.

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:42.240
I came ten years back,

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:46.880
and told them frankly about all these things, with names and things,

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:48.200
But they didn’t like Me.

00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:50.320
They said, "Why should You stop us from doing all these?"

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:51.880
I said, "Go ahead."

00:11:51.999 --> 00:11:55.760
But now what I find most of them are lost.

00:11:55.999 --> 00:11:57.999
They have just became like cabbages.

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.800
They are so mesmerized, they don’t know what they are doing,

00:12:02.999 --> 00:12:05.120
where they have to go.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:13.120
Now if the Spirit has to shine within us,

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:16.880
what should happen, what is Self Realization?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.200
Let’s see if there is a light in this room,

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:23.840
if you become the light, you don’t see the light.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:28.120
But through that you can see everyone, the light can see everyone.

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:32.440
And what do you see? First you must see yourself.

00:12:32.999 --> 00:12:35.160
You have never faced yourself.

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.680
People become mad.

00:12:37.880 --> 00:12:40.880
Till they are mad they don’t know that they are becoming mad.

00:12:40.999 --> 00:12:45.400
They get cancers, their diseases in the body is crawling up.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.200
They don’t know they got the disease, there’s any problem.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:51.240
They just continue with the life, without understanding.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.440
They have no way of finding out,

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.680
or diagnosis cannot be done by them.

00:12:58.240 --> 00:13:00.320
But once you become the Spirit,

00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:03.999
the Spirit when it emits through your fingers,

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:07.999
when you start feeling enlightenment of your fingertips,

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:13.080
you can feel what’s wrong with your chakras, means your centers.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.680
Now somebody can decode it

00:13:15.880 --> 00:13:17.880
and tell you, that this fingers means that,

00:13:17.999 --> 00:13:20.080
this finger means that, this finger means that,

00:13:20.280 --> 00:13:24.240
the combination and permutations of these seven centers,

00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:27.960
one two, three four, five, six, seven, as shown here.

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:31.360
We have marked with the colors to show you

00:13:31.999 --> 00:13:34.960
that how on the finger, hands,

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.120
feet have different, but hands,

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:43.800
you see the effect of those centers when you are enlightened.

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:46.999
Before that you cannot. Because you are like a computer.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:48.880
You are really a computer, otherwise

00:13:48.999 --> 00:13:51.280
also if you want to see rationally

00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:55.240
that you see something and you don’t think about it, but you see.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:58.120
What a perfect computer you are already.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.880
But the computer becomes

00:14:01.999 --> 00:14:04.999
a part and parcel of your awareness.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:08.800
You sort of become the master of that computer

00:14:08.999 --> 00:14:12.960
so that you can understand the decoding,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:17.999
and the maneuvering of all the processes of that computer.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.760
This computer is beautifully made,

00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.999
Is very beautifully made as you can see it.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.840
Is not a mix bag,

00:14:24.999 --> 00:14:26.880
as most of the psychologists believe

00:14:26.999 --> 00:14:29.200
that you have to go to the subconscious,

00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:32.200
to get to the higher super consciousness.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.840
Here you can see on the left hand side

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:37.040
is the subconscious and the collective subconscious.

00:14:37.240 --> 00:14:40.920
On the right hand side you have got this supraconscious

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:43.999
that is the future and the collective supraconscious.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:47.280
Down below is what you call the hell,

00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.999
and on top is the superconsciousness.

00:14:50.280 --> 00:14:53.120
To rise there is a passage kept very firmly.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.120
You have to pass through these centers

00:14:55.320 --> 00:14:57.999
and whatever problems are in the centers

00:14:58.120 --> 00:15:02.840
if you start feeling on your fingertips and know how to cure them,

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:08.999
you can make your Kundalini rise very nicely and establish Agnya.

00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.800
All these knowledge can be yours, very easily,

00:15:13.999 --> 00:15:16.999
but the first thing is that you have to get your Realization.

00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.480
Unless and until there is light,

00:15:19.999 --> 00:15:22.999
and if I tell you, this is not a snake, this is just a cord,

00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.120
you are not going to believe it.

00:15:25.999 --> 00:15:30.840
The light has to come to give you the complete idea about yourself,

00:15:30.999 --> 00:15:32.480
so you know yourself.

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.960
First of all you must know physically what is wrong.

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:40.120
Secondly you must know what's wrong with you mentally.

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:43.200
Now people who are ego oriented.

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:47.880
They torture others, they aggress others,

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.800
but they don’t know that they are full of ego.

00:15:52.999 --> 00:15:54.880
The people who are superego,

00:15:54.999 --> 00:15:57.480
means those who take tortures upon others,

00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.800
they start indulging into their miseries

00:15:59.999 --> 00:16:01.880
and start saying, "I must suffer,

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:04.999
I must have done something wrong, so I must suffer".

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:07.120
They accept that kind of a life.

00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.120
But after Realization you understand

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:14.200
that you are not your ego or superego, but you are your Self.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:17.999
And you are not to suffer, nor do you have to aggress anyone.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.840
Nor you have to take aggression from anyone,

00:16:20.999 --> 00:16:24.480
but you stand in the center, as the light.

00:16:26.160 --> 00:16:27.840
You have to just have to just

00:16:27.999 --> 00:16:31.400
have the source of joy flowing into you.

00:16:31.999 --> 00:16:35.280
All the time you have to get connected to the whole,

00:16:35.840 --> 00:16:38.320
so that you are looked after by the whole.

00:16:38.760 --> 00:16:42.000
You become part and parcel of the whole. You are part and parcel,

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.999
but you are not aware. You become aware of it.

00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:46.880
So the first thing happens to you

00:16:46.999 --> 00:16:50.240
that you come to know about your physical side and

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.120
mental side, whether you are emotional

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:56.440
or whether you are ego oriented.

00:16:57.080 --> 00:16:59.920
Then you start in the center.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.760
When I’m talking to you

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:03.440
maybe you are thinking of your past

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.400
or maybe you are thinking about of you future at this time.

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.920
But if I say that pay attention to yourself, you cannot pay.

00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:11.840
Your attention is outside.

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:13.880
That is why this happening takes place,

00:17:13.999 --> 00:17:16.320
which attracts your attention inside.

00:17:16.999 --> 00:17:20.120
And when the attention is attracted inside,

00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.080
then you start seeing yourself clearly,

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.160
understanding yourself, "That is the matter with me".

00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:30.999
What's wrong with the world today is wrong with every individual.

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:34.999
If the individuals improve, the whole world is going to improve.

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.999
So physically and mentally you get perfectly all right.

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:43.999
All kinds of diseases can be cured by Sahaja Yoga;

00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:47.360
you can cure yourself, I don’t have to cure you.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.920
Because you become empowered by that.

00:17:51.040 --> 00:17:54.999
Secondly, you also know what is wrong with you, Spiritually.

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.720
Supposing you have been to a wrong guru,

00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.999
supposing you have been mesmerized by a wrong person,

00:18:03.120 --> 00:18:05.080
now how are you going to know

00:18:05.280 --> 00:18:07.400
whether he is wrong or a right person?

00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:11.360
How will you find out? Supposing Christ comes stands before you,

00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:13.040
how will you recognize Christ?

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.200
Have you any way of finding out?

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:17.120
Anybody who talks sweetly

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:22.120
has all these professional methods of enticing you,

00:18:22.320 --> 00:18:24.120
you can fall a pray to that.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.840
But after Realization you find from your hand

00:18:28.999 --> 00:18:32.200
a new kind of a vibratory awareness is going.

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.880
Through these vibrations you can find out

00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:39.040
whether the person is false, hypocritical or a devil.

00:18:39.360 --> 00:18:43.800
If he is a devil you might even get blisters on your hand.

00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:48.760
And that's how you correct your Spiritual

00:18:48.999 --> 00:18:51.160
seeking when you have gone wrong.

00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:52.960
If you know how to correct it,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.680
the methods which are very simple, the movement of your hands,

00:18:57.880 --> 00:18:59.880
you can get out of that.

00:18:59.999 --> 00:19:03.840
Many people as you must have known, that who have been to cults,

00:19:03.999 --> 00:19:08.360
had fake gurus, have suffered. They have become like cabbages.

00:19:09.160 --> 00:19:14.440
But all those people can be saved if they get their Realization

00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.200
and gradually understand their power of getting out of it.

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:23.960
Because Spirit is self-powered, it works on itself.

00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:27.720
So first of all you know about yourself.

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:31.999
As a result of that, you drop off all your habits.

00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.999
Supposing there is a black spot on my sari,

00:19:36.440 --> 00:19:39.999
I cannot see and I am identified with it,

00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:42.999
so anybody tells me there is black spot, I won’t like it.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:48.999
But supposing I can see it, then I clean it myself.

00:19:49.280 --> 00:19:56.240
When the nectar or ambrosia of God’s love starts flowing in you,

00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.960
you just don’t need to drink, you just don't need to smoke,

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.440
you are no more a slave of any habits.

00:20:03.800 --> 00:20:05.000
You just become a free bird.

00:20:05.200 --> 00:20:08.999
That’s the real freedom, that nothing can entice you,

00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:10.960
nothing can enslave you.

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:13.760
You become so integrated that if you don’t want it,

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:16.440
you just don’t want it. Then your body will support you,

00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:18.880
your mind will support you, your Spirit will support you.

00:20:18.999 --> 00:20:21.440
You are completely integrated at that point.

00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.240
That is the first thing happens to you,

00:20:24.440 --> 00:20:26.999
as a person who comes to Sahaja Yoga;

00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:30.120
I’ve seen many of them, were alcoholics.

00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:32.999
We have some artists in India, were great alcoholics.

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.680
Very great artists. They came to Sahaja Yoga

00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.480
and they dropped their habits.

00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.280
They dropped them completely.

00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.480
They were amazed. Next day they dropped it.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.080
Because once you get the test

00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:56.880
of this great understanding that you are the Spirit,

00:20:56.999 --> 00:21:01.040
you just become so powerful that nothing can overpower you.

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:04.440
It has happened with many.

00:21:04.840 --> 00:21:07.680
Now only thing is that,

00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.999
what is the use, people ask Me, of becoming.

00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:18.760
The becoming is actually, is the epitome of your evolution.

00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:22.480
You have to do it. You cannot avoid it. If not today, tomorrow.

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:26.080
If you don’t accept it,

00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:29.800
then you'll have to face the consequences.

00:21:30.080 --> 00:21:32.920
But you have to become the Spirit.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.480
The another very great thing it happens,

00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:40.999
that the light that you have, gives light to others.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:43.880
You can enlighten their lights.

00:21:43.999 --> 00:21:46.160
Their candles are not yet ready,

00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:48.999
then you know how to put them right.

00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:52.400
You can enlighten their lights with your light,

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.999
without obliging them.

00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.999
Like the sun shines.

00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:01.200
It doesn’t say "I’m shinning, I’m doing all this,

00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:05.240
I’m creating chlorophyll". It doesn’t. It just shines.

00:22:05.999 --> 00:22:09.040
But we can say that it doesn’t do any work,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:12.200
or we say he does non-work, a-karma.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.640
In the same way it starts flowing through your being,

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.440
just working out.

00:22:17.840 --> 00:22:22.280
And anybody says, "Mother, I am thankful", I’m surprised.

00:22:22.999 --> 00:22:25.999
Because if you are a part and parcel of My being,

00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:31.880
if this is my finger, if I try to soothe My finger,

00:22:31.999 --> 00:22:34.400
is not going to thank Me.

00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:37.480
In the same way, there is not the other left,

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.840
you just start feeling another person upon your fingertips.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:45.999
That means you become again collectively conscious,

00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:51.400
and later on as you grow you become cosmic conscious.

00:22:51.999 --> 00:22:56.840
That means that you know how to handle even the elements.

00:22:56.999 --> 00:23:00.320
But first you have to become collectively conscious.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.920
When you become collectively conscious,

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:06.999
suddenly a tremendous compassion and love starts growing in you.

00:23:07.840 --> 00:23:10.880
You feel so nourished yourself that you want to give.

00:23:10.999 --> 00:23:14.000
You have so much that the charity just

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:16.240
makes you feel that you should give.

00:23:16.440 --> 00:23:18.880
And when this charity starts flowing,

00:23:18.999 --> 00:23:22.160
then you are amazed how it works.

00:23:22.999 --> 00:23:25.760
We invite people to our house to create good relationships.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:29.600
We give them food, we give them this, try to make good relationship.

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:32.840
Here the relationship is spontaneous.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.920
You don’t have to say about it, it just exists.

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.920
You feel it that is there.

00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:41.320
I’ll give you an example of a girl who went to Sicily

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:43.000
and she was feeling very lonely she said

00:23:43.200 --> 00:23:45.640
"now what am I to talk to these people, you see,

00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:48.200
there is nobody here who is a realized soul".

00:23:48.400 --> 00:23:50.040
She was feeling very lonely.

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:52.200
Suddenly she felt some vibrations around her.

00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:57.200
She turn around and she saw another lady sitting there.

00:23:57.680 --> 00:24:01.440
She said, “Are you the child of Mother?"

00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:05.160
She just got up and grasped her, she said “Yes, I am".

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:08.160
"I could feel your vibration, you could feel mine"

00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:10.880
And just they understood each other,

00:24:10.999 --> 00:24:13.760
that they were, they had never met before,

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.160
their language is very different,

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:16.920
they were from two different countries,

00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:18.880
they had nothing to do with each other.

00:24:18.999 --> 00:24:21.120
But the love and understanding, that they had,

00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.840
that all these identifications drop off,

00:24:23.999 --> 00:24:25.440
that you are an Italian,

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:28.040
or you are an Indian, or you are an American

00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:29.840
you become a human being,

00:24:29.999 --> 00:24:33.720
and a super human being who can feel others.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:37.080
This knowledge is not new.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:40.040
It was a secret knowledge for some time.

00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:45.400
In the sixth century in our country, a great incarnation came

00:24:45.800 --> 00:24:49.280
as Adi Shankaracharya and he talked about it openly.

00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.999
And after that also, we had many poets who talked about it.

00:24:53.160 --> 00:24:55.720
Hundred years back, William Blake came in.

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.880
And he said all about it, so clearly, he's such a seer,

00:24:59.999 --> 00:25:02.800
that he beats all the sears, everywhere.

00:25:02.999 --> 00:25:05.120
The amount of precision he has used,

00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:06.880
because perhaps he felt

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:11.360
that if Western mind has to understand, they need precision.

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:16.360
Even My house he has described, exact place he has described.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:18.920
Even what Sahaja Yogis will be doing,

00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:22.240
where our ashram will be in London, what places I’ll be visiting,

00:25:22.440 --> 00:25:24.720
I mean to such a detailed thing.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:27.960
And surprisingly, we discovered all these

00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:31.880
after we have been to that place, after we have done it.

00:25:31.999 --> 00:25:34.480
Like in London, we had our ashram,

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:36.880
and it was a very dilapidated house, bombed.

00:25:36.999 --> 00:25:41.800
That he has written down. It will be a house, ruined house,

00:25:41.999 --> 00:25:44.480
because people didn’t have so much money.

00:25:44.880 --> 00:25:48.120
So, and then I laid the foundation.

00:25:48.800 --> 00:25:50.999
And he said "the foundation will be laid in Lambert,

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.160
come to Lambert.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.440
Her sinews vibrated. He used the word "Her" all the time.

00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:58.720
And the clear cut picture he has given.

00:25:58.920 --> 00:26:02.080
But people called him crazy, that he is a psychological case.

00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:06.440
Because they don’t have that super consciousness to understand.

00:26:06.840 --> 00:26:10.320
But if you ask any Sahaja Yogi, he understands him very well.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.999
So even only 100 years back, there was someone who talked about Me.

00:26:15.160 --> 00:26:18.800
I would say 70 years back, somebody talked about Me, in India.

00:26:18.999 --> 00:26:23.040
But people at 14 000 years back, have also talked about Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:25.800
So you can imagine that it is not

00:26:25.999 --> 00:26:28.880
that today I've just started coming out of the blue,

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:31.000
and some sort of a neo business has started.

00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:34.480
It`s a traditional growth,

00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:36.760
in a very traditional way,

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:41.999
respecting all the establishments, not to demolish anything.

00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:46.880
But whatever is not correct, drops out by itself.

00:26:46.999 --> 00:26:50.840
All that is useless drops out by itself.

00:26:50.999 --> 00:26:55.640
In the living process, even a flower has to drop out its [chalis]

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:57.480
if it has to become the fruit.

00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.360
In the same way everything works out so naturally, the way it grows,

00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.999
that you are amazed that at the end of it you remain pure Spirit.

00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:13.440
Your eyes become innocent. There is no lust and greed in it.

00:27:13.920 --> 00:27:17.320
What Christ has said, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes",

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:19.720
that innocence is awakened within you

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.960
and you just become, become innocent.

00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:26.000
Becoming innocent is not possible otherwise,

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:28.120
but you just become innocent.

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:30.080
You become really childlike.

00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.280
Your whole attitude towards life becomes childlike.

00:27:33.720 --> 00:27:36.880
Now some people may say that, "When people become like that, Mother,

00:27:36.999 --> 00:27:38.999
then what happens to our business?"

00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.800
There was a girl in San Francisco,

00:27:41.999 --> 00:27:45.040
an Indian girl who had married another Indian.

00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:48.800
And they were having a shop. And she said:"After realization Mother,

00:27:48.999 --> 00:27:53.720
I forgot about counting this, that, I was very meticulous.

00:27:53.920 --> 00:27:55.880
But I never made any profits."

00:27:55.999 --> 00:27:58.400
But now I’m told that they have made so many profits,

00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:02.920
they are no more there, that they have 14 stores all over New York.

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:08.999
So how things [help] you and work it out when you leave it to God,

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:14.240
because He is thousand fold more efficient.

00:28:14.760 --> 00:28:17.999
I mean He is absolutely, we cannot compare Him to ourselves,

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:20.760
because He is perfect.

00:28:20.999 --> 00:28:25.280
Everything is perfect, but you must enter into His Kingdom.

00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:30.120
If i don’t come to America, how will I know how Americans operate?

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.120
When I have come here, then only I’ve come to know.

00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:39.880
But if you see God's realm is such, that when you enter it,

00:28:39.999 --> 00:28:43.200
you feel you are looked after every moment.

00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.040
How He guides you, how He watches you,

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:50.320
in the smallest way and in the biggest way, it's most surprising.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.999
It's not easy to understand His ways.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:56.600
One of the examples, I don’t know, if Warren has told you.

00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.999
Did you tell them about the Bedford example, Warren? No.

00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:01.880
I must tell you this one, so that you’ll

00:29:01.999 --> 00:29:03.800
understand His ways are so great.

00:29:03.999 --> 00:29:09.040
I was in Bedford one night, and we had about 600 people there.

00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:12.400
I was speaking to them, about 7 o’clock I was there,

00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:13.960
till about 10 o’clock.

00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:20.880
At 8 o’clock about 10-15 miles away, one boy fell down in a ditch,

00:29:20.999 --> 00:29:24.160
in a sense that there was a bridge and he fell down very low,

00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.680
with his motorcycle.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.920
And when they sent for the ambulance,

00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.440
he just walked up and came out,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.360
so they were quite surprised that how could he come.

00:29:34.080 --> 00:29:36.880
So they took him in the ambulance to the hospital,

00:29:36.999 --> 00:29:38.680
and the police also came.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.999
Then he told them, that "A lady, Indian lady

00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.880
came in a white car - I have a white car -

00:29:44.999 --> 00:29:49.960
and She came down and She healed me completely".

00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:52.800
But She said that, "At the base of the spine there is still problem,

00:29:52.999 --> 00:29:54.360
you come and see me at my house."

00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.120
And She went away. But the people who were there, they said,

00:29:57.320 --> 00:30:00.080
"We saw no car, we saw no lady coming here.

00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.000
What is he talking about?"

00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:04.880
So they noted down everything and next day,

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.040
because he was completely all right, they were surprised,

00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.840
falling from that distance, nothing had happened.

00:30:09.999 --> 00:30:12.920
He saw My photograph in the newspaper,

00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:15.880
and then he said, "This is the lady".

00:30:15.999 --> 00:30:19.280
And that was at 8 o’clock when I was speaking to so many people.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:21.880
So they were quite surprised when he went and told the police,

00:30:21.999 --> 00:30:26.240
and he told the hospital people, that they informed the newspaper.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.880
And newspaper people wrote to us

00:30:28.999 --> 00:30:33.920
and one of our Sahaja Yogis, answered back,

00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.999
and the whole thing was in the newspaper.

00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.880
And they were quite amazed at it.

00:30:37.999 --> 00:30:41.720
Now how this has happened. You may say how can this happen, Mother?

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.800
It can happen, because as you have got television,

00:30:44.999 --> 00:30:49.080
God has tremendous organization of television.

00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.680
He has all telecommunication, everything.

00:30:52.880 --> 00:30:56.120
Don’t think that you can only produce these, these are dead.

00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:57.920
These are good for nothing.

00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:02.440
His working is so great that tat-kshane, at that moment.

00:31:02.840 --> 00:31:06.999
As soon as you see, as soon as you speak

00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:09.880
as soon as you desire, it works out.

00:31:09.999 --> 00:31:13.080
Even if somebody just desires,

00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:18.040
and he is a man looked after God,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.760
even he may not be a realized soul. He is helped in such a way.

00:31:22.999 --> 00:31:25.320
Now then after that they described all such

00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:27.960
happenings that took place in India, and everywhere.

00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.720
But what I am trying to say,

00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:33.440
that we are so much proud of what our achievements are.

00:31:33.840 --> 00:31:38.999
These achievements are nothing, compared to what God has for you.

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:41.920
In His realm once you enter,

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.440
actually you yourself become so beautiful,

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:51.400
you yourself become such a dynamic, beautiful, silent flame of love,

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:56.960
that you are not bothered at all as to what is happening around,

00:31:57.080 --> 00:31:59.999
what is going wrong, you don’t get upset with it.

00:32:00.360 --> 00:32:04.240
You are silently watching all this joke, all this drama,

00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:07.240
hoping that one day, the rest of the world

00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:11.120
will also become realized,

00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:15.440
and the rest of the world will also enjoy the blessings of God.

00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:20.080
This is what is desired by every Sahaja Yogi,

00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:22.920
and that's why they forced Me to come to America,

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:25.920
that I should come and speak to people here.

00:32:26.040 --> 00:32:29.160
So we must understand what are the barriers within us,

00:32:29.360 --> 00:32:31.040
not to understand Divinity

00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.120
Why we cannot understand Divinity?

00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:35.800
First of all we have had no education.

00:32:35.999 --> 00:32:40.080
Whatever education we have had was about the tree that is outside.

00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:43.880
But we have no education about the roots, doesn’t matter.

00:32:43.999 --> 00:32:46.280
To go to the roots, you have to become subtle.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.999
When you get Realization you enter into the roots,

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:51.080
and the knowledge becomes yours in no time.

00:32:51.280 --> 00:32:53.960
You don’t need much time to know about it,

00:32:54.080 --> 00:32:57.360
because you become the light and through that light you can see.

00:32:57.800 --> 00:33:01.120
Like you must have seen these people who work in the mines, you see,

00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.880
they have a light placed here

00:33:02.999 --> 00:33:04.400
and through that they can see everything.

00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:07.440
In the same way you become the light, you don’t see the light,

00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:11.999
You become the light, and in that light you see everything.

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.240
Now, when this happens to you,

00:33:16.440 --> 00:33:19.999
your attention, as I told you, becomes collective.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:25.080
Your attention starts feel another personality,

00:33:25.320 --> 00:33:29.880
another person, another person’s, another people,

00:33:29.999 --> 00:33:32.840
and you start understanding what the problem is.

00:33:32.999 --> 00:33:35.840
And you can help them,

00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:42.440
by just doing some sort of a blessing, as you say,

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.200
and you can work it out.

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.880
But there are people who are unwise.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.800
In this world, there are people who are stupid.

00:33:48.999 --> 00:33:50.240
They need not be educated.

00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.800
Educated people also can be very unwise people.

00:33:53.999 --> 00:33:59.200
They need not be very intelligent,

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.080
or they may be intelligent,

00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:04.240
but wisdom is an innate quality in a person.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.000
If they are wise enough,

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:08.999
they know how to handle the situation, to understand themselves

00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.720
and they settle down in Sahaja Yoga in no time.

00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:15.080
But those who are not so wise, take time.

00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:20.040
So one has to understand that we have to have perseverance about it

00:34:20.240 --> 00:34:23.720
we have to settle down into it, absolutely master it,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:26.280
because you become the master.

00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:28.800
That’s the point is, you become the master of yourself

00:34:28.999 --> 00:34:31.840
you don`t need any guru. You become the master.

00:34:31.999 --> 00:34:35.960
As I will tell you, the left and the right, is here.

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.880
We can compare it to the brake and the accelerator of a car.

00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:42.480
Left side is the brake

00:34:42.880 --> 00:34:44.240
- Gregoire later you do it, because you see,

00:34:44.440 --> 00:34:46.320
people have attention very much confused.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:48.440
If you get up immediately their eyes go there.

00:34:48.840 --> 00:34:51.760
We should keep, you see, he is just taking a photograph.

00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:53.440
We have seen so many people in this world.

00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:56.999
For a change, keep your attention little concentrated.

00:34:59.440 --> 00:35:01.080
But it will happen.

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.720
It will happen, once you get your Realization,

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:06.999
your attention will be very, very nicely placed.

00:35:07.240 --> 00:35:12.760
Now, when you people know that this has happened to you,

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:17.280
and when you become the master,

00:35:17.999 --> 00:35:22.200
you know the brake and the accelerator in you.

00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:26.160
But still, actually you are not the master,

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:27.999
you are still the driver.

00:35:28.120 --> 00:35:31.320
And when you are a driver, you automatically do it driving,

00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.240
but still one should not say that you are a driver.

00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.920
You know the balancing of it, you know how to maneuver it,

00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:38.999
how to act.

00:35:39.999 --> 00:35:44.999
But then, what happens? To become the master, what do you do?

00:35:45.760 --> 00:35:47.480
This Realization takes place.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:51.320
Then you become the master, and you see the driver,

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.360
you see the accelerator, and you see the brake in yourself.

00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.080
And you just enjoy like a master.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:01.920
When you become the master, you cannot be slave of anything.

00:36:02.160 --> 00:36:04.480
No more slavery, the real freedom lies

00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.920
in becoming the master of yourself.

00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.880
No use mastering others, just master yourself.

00:36:09.999 --> 00:36:12.880
But that mastering cannot be done by lecturing

00:36:12.999 --> 00:36:15.880
or by brainwashing, or by talking to you,

00:36:15.999 --> 00:36:17.960
but it's a happening that has to take place.

00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:21.960
The Kundalini has to rise and has to give you Realization.

00:36:22.840 --> 00:36:27.999
This, unless and until this happens we should not say that we know.

00:36:28.240 --> 00:36:33.720
Know, knowledge is not, when we are not one with the Divine.

00:36:33.999 --> 00:36:39.200
It’s like a machine or you can say telephone not connected.

00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:43.240
We have to get our connection first, establish the connection,

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:46.800
and then we become the knower.

00:36:46.999 --> 00:36:50.760
And the knowledge becomes a part and parcel of you.

00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.600
But this cannot happen to stupid people.

00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.440
It’s not meant for stupid at all,

00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:57.760
neither for the cowardly.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:00.999
It is meant for people who are courageous,

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:03.999
who are people of wisdom,

00:37:04.120 --> 00:37:08.880
who are not given to nonsensical things easily.

00:37:08.999 --> 00:37:12.200
That`s why in Sahaja Yoga there are two forces working all the time.

00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.480
You may get your Realization today here,

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.999
but I won’t say that you’ll sustain it. I won’t guarantee that.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.999
The reason is, we have two forces,

00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.999
one is centripetal and another is centrifugal.

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:25.200
By one force you are attracted towards it,

00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:27.200
by another force you are thrown out.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:29.200
Because you have come out of matter.

00:37:29.400 --> 00:37:31.400
And the matter tries to drag you down.

00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:32.999
You have to master it,

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.800
in such a way that the Spirit sits on the top of the matter.

00:37:36.999 --> 00:37:38.999
And the matter doesn’t dominate you anymore.

00:37:39.160 --> 00:37:44.080
And for that you have to meditate, and you will be in meditation.

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.480
It's simple thing to be done, there’s nothing difficult.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.880
Sahaja Yoga is the simplest method.

00:37:49.999 --> 00:37:55.240
Sahaja also means, it means also a simple, easy.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:37:57.920
But "saha-ja", saha means with,

00:37:58.040 --> 00:37:59.920
"ja" means born, is born with you.

00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:02.960
But today this is called in India as Maha Yoga.

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:05.880
Because before this, all the Realizations

00:38:05.999 --> 00:38:08.040
took place of course through Sahaj only,

00:38:08.240 --> 00:38:10.999
by Kundalini awakening. There is no other way.

00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:14.400
Only Kundalini awakening is the way you get your Realization.

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.680
Like some people said, there must be some another way.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.999
There is none. Because like a seed has to sprout

00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.880
through the primule only, in the same way, in your case,

00:38:23.999 --> 00:38:27.320
in human beings, the Kundalini has to rise to give you Realization.

00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:29.840
There’s no other way, but this.

00:38:29.999 --> 00:38:32.880
It is called as Sahaja method, means spontaneous method.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:34.880
But today it is called as Maha Yoga,

00:38:34.999 --> 00:38:38.320
because you`ll find thousands of people get Realization.

00:38:38.720 --> 00:38:40.920
People who have been with Me in the villages of India,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.440
have seen 6000, 8000 people gathered.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:47.880
I mean in New York we have so many people, see how many have come.

00:38:47.999 --> 00:38:50.880
But if you go to a village, one village in India,

00:38:50.999 --> 00:38:54.120
you’ll be surprised, people will be pouring on their bullock carts,

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.640
" There, Mataji has come".

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.920
Because they know, and in that atmosphere, you see,

00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.320
the fragrance of this good news spreads so fast,

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:06.720
spreads so fast, because that’s the atmosphere for that.

00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.440
But where there is so much of mental activity,

00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:10.999
nothing can penetrate.

00:39:11.160 --> 00:39:16.120
They cannot see, they have no sensitivity to visualize

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:18.999
what is good for them and what is not.

00:39:19.720 --> 00:39:21.999
So the last chakra is of the 7-th,

00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.760
all the 7 chakras are in the last chakra.

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.240
And that's how you get complete integrated.

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:29.880
Your emotional being, your mental being,

00:39:29.999 --> 00:39:33.440
your physical being, your spiritual being completely integrated.

00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:36.880
You go beyond time. You are not bothered about time at all.

00:39:36.999 --> 00:39:38.880
If you say "Mother, when will get Realization?

00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.999
I say "Just now". That's the point is.

00:39:42.240 --> 00:39:46.360
But if you don’t get it, all right. If you get it, just now.

00:39:46.680 --> 00:39:48.920
This Kundalini rises in a split of a second,

00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:51.040
like a jet it goes out of your head.

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:54.080
But with so many people it just struggles [for days].

00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:57.400
She is there at the base just trying to come up.

00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.999
It's very difficult sometimes.

00:39:59.120 --> 00:40:01.680
I've seen some Kundalinis in such a bad shape

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:04.880
that it horrifies Me. What we have done to ourselves?

00:40:04.999 --> 00:40:08.400
By this kind of a tomfoolery, "What is wrong? What is wrong?",

00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:10.440
going into this and going into that,

00:40:10.720 --> 00:40:13.760
we have really ruined our chances of our evolution.

00:40:13.960 --> 00:40:15.880
And then you say you are seeking.

00:40:15.999 --> 00:40:19.840
How to help people? You have already weakened yourself so much.

00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:21.440
It takes time.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.080
It’s one of my concerns, that so many saints

00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:27.160
are born in this country, are born in the West.

00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.840
But where are they lost, what has happened to them?

00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:33.999
Why do they take so much time to take to reality?

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:36.360
They are driven to any fake guru

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.720
to any fake person who is making money,

00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.999
who has got Rolls Royces, this, that.

00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.120
Why should it impress you so much, I can’t understand.

00:40:44.320 --> 00:40:46.999
Like a newspaper I went to, and they said,

00:40:47.120 --> 00:40:48.800
"How many Rolls Royce She has got?"

00:40:48.999 --> 00:40:50.080
They said, "She has no Rolls Royces".

00:40:50.280 --> 00:40:52.800
Then they said, "We are not interested". Imagine!

00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:58.120
Such a thing happening in your country is absolutely absurd,

00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:02.160
that such a thing should happen to people who are intelligent,

00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.999
that God cannot be purchased,

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:08.680
He cannot be paid in Rolls Royces and all these material things.

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.960
They are nothing to Him, they are not equal to the dust of His feet.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:14.120
And what is there to give up? Some people talk

00:41:14.320 --> 00:41:16.280
that you must give up this and give up that.

00:41:16.480 --> 00:41:18.960
When you are not holding to anything, what is there to give up?

00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:20.440
All these nonsensical ideas,

00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:22.600
that you give up this for God, give up that.

00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:26.240
God doesn't want all these nonsensical things you give to yourself.

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:28.960
But what happens, you get out of it.

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:33.280
A thought rises and falls off. Another thought rises and falls off.

00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:36.800
When you are in the thought, you are materialistic

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:41.760
you are mentally thinking and all those things happening.

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:44.800
But in the center is a little space,

00:41:44.999 --> 00:41:46.999
which is called in Sanskrit as vilamba.

00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:49.320
When you rise above that,

00:41:49.640 --> 00:41:51.720
then neither you are in the future nor in the past.

00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:53.640
You are above time.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:54.999
You are absolutely detached.

00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.320
You start seeing the whole thing as a joke.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.999
And then you become a real dynamic person.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:04.160
And you create things which are superb and eternal.

00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.800
Like I would say Mozart was a realized soul.

00:42:06.999 --> 00:42:09.120
Michelangelo was another realized soul.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:12.440
They created all those things because they were realized souls.

00:42:12.760 --> 00:42:16.160
They could go out and see for themselves what’s happening.

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:18.999
All the great geniuses who have lust,

00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:22.440
all useless, vulgar, cheap type have fallen.

00:42:22.760 --> 00:42:25.920
They do not stand, they cannot stand the test of time.

00:42:26.040 --> 00:42:29.400
They have all gone out. See, Christ came 2000 years back.

00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.080
How many artists from 2000 years back, have stood the test of time?

00:42:34.999 --> 00:42:37.280
He is still there. He is still there.

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:40.040
Why? Because He was genuine.

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:42.880
He was real. What He said was the truth.

00:42:42.999 --> 00:42:44.880
That's why He is still there.

00:42:44.999 --> 00:42:47.160
And that's what we have to understand that once you become

00:42:47.360 --> 00:42:49.240
that genuine Self, that is you,

00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.160
the beauty, the glory within you.

00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.640
Then you don’t have to worry, you never perish,

00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:57.120
you get into the eternal life.

00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:01.080
Now there is no end to my talking. I’ve been talking

00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:05.400
for now, at least one and a half month continuously.

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.880
Apart from that I was 21 days out in tour in Europe,

00:43:09.999 --> 00:43:13.160
just 2 days in between, and again I came here.

00:43:14.160 --> 00:43:16.880
I have given so many lectures, that in London if you go,

00:43:16.999 --> 00:43:18.600
you’ll find thousands of them.

00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:21.999
I have spoken individually about ego, superego,

00:43:22.120 --> 00:43:24.999
all these things, about chakras, all the details about it,

00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.280
and I’ve gone through all the details.

00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:32.920
But in these 3 days whatever I could cover, I've tried to tell you,

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:35.040
and I also allowed you to ask questions.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:38.360
But yesterday as you know, some stupid people came in

00:43:38.640 --> 00:43:40.480
and tried to disturb Me. Now look at them.

00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:42.680
There is, I can’t understand that,

00:43:42.920 --> 00:43:45.480
because their daughter telephoned to Me, today also,

00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:48.720
that her father has gone to work, he is not there.

00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.680
So they are cheating their daughter,

00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:52.640
coming and disturbing others.

00:43:52.880 --> 00:43:54.720
Abd why are they doing this?

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.880
Why don’t they understand their child?

00:43:56.999 --> 00:43:59.280
They don’t believe in God, but the child believes in God,

00:43:59.480 --> 00:44:03.160
let the child, because that child is free now, in this country.

00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:05.800
You should allow the child to know about the God.

00:44:05.999 --> 00:44:08.920
Even supposing she does wrong, I say even if it is a cult,

00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:12.080
how can you stop? But they can’t see the point.

00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.999
That the point is, she is a different category of a person.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.280
She’s a person who’s a seeker. She has to seek.

00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:22.240
Even if she is making mistakes, they cannot stop it,

00:44:22.440 --> 00:44:23.999
that is her nature.

00:44:24.120 --> 00:44:26.640
She will never stop, till she has found it.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:28.800
Because that is a special category.

00:44:28.999 --> 00:44:31.999
She is not a mundane type of materialistic personality

00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.999
who can take just to anything.

00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.800
She is a person who is a seeker. I know they have done mistakes,

00:44:36.999 --> 00:44:38.600
they have gone to cults, they have ruined themselves,

00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:39.880
whatever it is.

00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.040
But she’ll be born again and again and will be seeking.

00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:46.800
Because she is a person who is a seeker,

00:44:46.999 --> 00:44:48.999
is a very special category,

00:44:49.160 --> 00:44:53.160
and that say, special category is at the epitome of evolution.

00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:56.360
The mundane type of vulgar, loafer type of people,

00:44:56.640 --> 00:44:58.640
are not meant for God.

00:44:58.880 --> 00:45:01.880
He is not bothered about that, just a waste product.

00:45:02.360 --> 00:45:06.040
The people who are seekers are only under His grace

00:45:06.240 --> 00:45:08.440
and He is only worried and concerned about them

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.080
and not about the people

00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:12.960
who maybe are occupying very big positions or anything,

00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:15.480
I mean My husband is in the, you know,

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.160
he is a secretary general and all that,

00:45:17.360 --> 00:45:18.800
but i never went to the UN, at all.

00:45:18.999 --> 00:45:20.999
I said, "I have nothing to do with your", It has nothing to do,

00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:23.760
because this is a special category of people.

00:45:23.999 --> 00:45:26.999
They will meet Me here, that`s what it is.

00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:33.160
One has to understand that is not what family you come from,

00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:37.999
what nationality you come from, or what color you have,

00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.999
what education you have had,

00:45:40.160 --> 00:45:43.680
but what kind of a being, the inner being you have, is important.

00:45:43.920 --> 00:45:47.160
If that is the seeker, then you get your Realization.

00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.160
May God bless you all.

00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.960
Now can you ask Me some questions?

00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.960
If you want to, but don’t try to dominate Me, that’s not good.

00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.160
Yesterday they misbehaved to such an extent.

00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:03.760
What happened? Is all right?

00:46:03.999 --> 00:46:05.160
SM: She has come?
SY: Yes she is here.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.240
She's come, she told the police.

00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:10.120
SY: She's just sitting there quietly with her mother.

00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:11.999
SM: Where?

00:46:12.120 --> 00:46:16.000
SY: Any questions? Yes.

00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.200
Q: Shri Mataji, when you spoke

00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.240
SM: Yes he is asking it.

00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.800
Q: all about the people from Your country

00:46:25.999 --> 00:46:28.440
who came to our country the United States,

00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:33.920
as teachers who, who are [unclear] false teachers

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:38.000
and not very [unclear] and not realized, not realized.

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:42.960
Are there any in Your country or in our country as teachers

00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:46.960
who do respect and [unclear] are realized people?

00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:50.999
SY: You’ve spoken of teachers and gurus who come from your country,

00:46:51.120 --> 00:46:54.720
who are either false teachers or not realized.

00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:58.600
Are there [unclear] are realized?

00:46:58.800 --> 00:47:01.880
SM: There are many, but they don`t want to come. Let`s sit.

00:47:01.999 --> 00:47:03.480
Q: I mean are there any...

00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:05.640
Agree that, I understand.

00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:08.360
There are many real ones also in India.

00:47:08.720 --> 00:47:11.000
They know about My work.

00:47:17.999 --> 00:47:20.680
There are many who are real gurus in India.

00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:24.400
And they know about My work. They respect Me very much.

00:47:24.999 --> 00:47:27.400
And I asked one of them,

00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:30.880
who was [real] one, to come to United States,

00:47:30.999 --> 00:47:33.760
because I could not come, it's dangerous.

00:47:33.999 --> 00:47:35.880
He just refused first of all.

00:47:35.999 --> 00:47:39.320
But he [unclear] and within 3 days he ran away.

00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:41.000
He said "They'll never understand me".

00:47:41.200 --> 00:47:44.999
Mother they want me to wear some horns. He would not stay.

00:47:45.160 --> 00:47:47.999
So they are. There are many who are real gurus,

00:47:48.120 --> 00:47:52.920
but they are hiding themselves in the hills and vales.

00:47:53.040 --> 00:47:56.000
And they are very strict people, I'm afraid they are not [for us].

00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:59.240
[unclear]

00:47:59.840 --> 00:48:02.480
"Because we have worked very hard to become like this

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.280
and these people want to take advantage of our achievements

00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:08.999
[unclear].

00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:15.000
There is one called as Narendra Maharaj because [unclear].

00:48:15.240 --> 00:48:20.320
They say [unclear] and poor person

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.080
his legs and hands were broken by other people, you see.

00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:25.880
That's what they do [unclear].

00:48:25.999 --> 00:48:28.240
Till the person [unclear]

00:48:28.440 --> 00:48:32.160
and they always trouble the right people.

00:48:33.040 --> 00:48:36.320
So I went to see him, because he was telling people,

00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.680
that "Now, Mother has come, so why do you want to [trouble me]?

00:48:38.880 --> 00:48:40.400
Go and see Her".

00:48:40.999 --> 00:48:43.800
And he told Me that, "If anybody troubles you Mother

00:48:43.999 --> 00:48:45.880
send him over to me".

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:48.880
I didn't know he was such a straight man, Myself.

00:48:48.999 --> 00:48:51.800
So there was one fellow who was torturing My life,

00:48:51.999 --> 00:48:54.999
in the program often he used to come and ask such questions and,

00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:58.800
very funny type. So I told him, [unclear].

00:48:58.999 --> 00:49:02.800
[unclear] to Maharashtra.

00:49:02.999 --> 00:49:05.760
He thought, "Oh, Mother [unclear]

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:07.400
I went to see him.

00:49:07.800 --> 00:49:10.160
After one month I saw him, he was sitting like this

00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.880
in the passage, [unclear].

00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.999
And this fellow had put his legs on his neck and was juggling.

00:49:17.240 --> 00:49:20.320
And people brought him [unclear].

00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:23.240
The whole thing was horrifing, tears came into My eyes.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.360
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:49:25.680 --> 00:49:28.640
He said, "Mother, I must tell you what has happened to me,

00:49:28.840 --> 00:49:29.880
[unclear]

00:49:29.999 --> 00:49:32.080
"What happened?" "I went to that guru".

00:49:32.280 --> 00:49:33.720
"Then why? What happened?

00:49:33.920 --> 00:49:35.400
He said, "I just told [unclear] things against You".

00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:36.880
I said, "What did you tell him?"

00:49:36.999 --> 00:49:38.999
I just said that, "She gives Realization

00:49:39.160 --> 00:49:41.720
to every Tom, Dick and Harry and She should be careful

00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.800
[unclear] all kinds of things like this.

00:49:43.999 --> 00:49:45.880
He said, "You are wiser than Mother, are you?"

00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.440
And that's all he said and I slept off.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:51.320
In the night he [unclear] a tiger

00:49:51.720 --> 00:49:53.640
so the tiger pushed me into a ditch

00:49:53.840 --> 00:49:56.200
and then I fell down, about 3 feet down.

00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.280
and I broke my legs.

00:49:58.480 --> 00:50:02.000
And then he locks up

00:50:02.200 --> 00:50:04.999
[unclear]

00:50:05.160 --> 00:50:08.240
about three inch [unclear]. He said, "Now, eat it".

00:50:08.800 --> 00:50:11.000
I was there for 5-6 days like that.

00:50:11.200 --> 00:50:12.999
Then he sent somebody to pick me up,

00:50:13.120 --> 00:50:14.840
they wanted to [unclear], treat me

00:50:14.999 --> 00:50:19.040
and then they said, "Now see our guru". So they brought him there.

00:50:19.280 --> 00:50:22.360
He said, "Now you take his legs and put them in your neck

00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:25.999
and [unclear] to your Mother. She is your guru, not me".

00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:28.080
I was a really shocked at it.

00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.040
Another fellow, a doctor used [to think] no end of himself,

00:50:31.240 --> 00:50:32.680
and he tried to argue much with Me

00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:35.640
so I said, "You go and see [unclear]".

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.840
So he went to see him.

00:50:37.999 --> 00:50:39.640
And when he went to see him, you see,

00:50:39.840 --> 00:50:43.160
he told him some sort of a thing, I don't know what he told him,

00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:46.200
but when he came back I saw he was looking thin.

00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:49.880
So I said, "Why [unclear]. What has happened?

00:50:49.999 --> 00:50:52.240
He said, "Every day I had to carry seven miles,

00:50:52.440 --> 00:50:56.999
two buckets of water". [unclear]

00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.640
I said, "But for what?"

00:50:58.840 --> 00:51:01.960
He said "That's what You said [unclear] do like this.

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:04.880
So I asked this man, I said, "Why did you do like that?"

00:51:04.999 --> 00:51:08.600
He said, "For a donkey, he must be [brought] this way.

00:51:08.800 --> 00:51:09.960
You are too kind.

00:51:10.080 --> 00:51:11.999
They don't know how much we have [worked].

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:14.800
They are extremely strict people, I've seen that.

00:51:14.999 --> 00:51:17.040
They beat their disciples sometimes.

00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:21.960
Another one I've met, was called as [unclear], something like that.

00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:23.800
And he lived [unclear].

00:51:23.999 --> 00:51:26.999
And he came to see Me in another place called Ambarnath,

00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:30.440
where his disciple was living [unclear].

00:51:32.360 --> 00:51:34.960
And this disciple took Me to see him there,

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.040
in the ashram that he had.

00:51:37.320 --> 00:51:42.760
And he, as soon as we entered, you see

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.880
[unclear] his disciple told me,

00:51:44.999 --> 00:51:48.040
"Mataji, my guru [unclear], very badly".

00:51:48.440 --> 00:51:50.720
So I went there, he touched My Feet and all.

00:51:50.920 --> 00:51:52.640
I said, "Why did you beat him?

00:51:52.840 --> 00:51:58.320
He said, you know when going [unclear] he was smoking.

00:51:58.480 --> 00:51:59.880
So I hit him hard".

00:51:59.999 --> 00:52:01.880
Then I said, "Really you should not have done it.

00:52:01.999 --> 00:52:04.480
If you give him Realization then he won't.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:06.320
But his Agnya chakra is catching.

00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:08.920
And the Agnya chakra is catching, so poor fellow, you see,

00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.320
he does not know to get rid of it, so he's smoking

00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:13.440
He said, "Who cleared my Agnya chakra?

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:16.000
I cleared mine for years together, I've worked hard.

00:52:16.200 --> 00:52:17.680
Why should I [unclear]?

00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:19.320
I said, "This is five minutes job".

00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:20.999
"For You this is five minutes job".

00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.960
I cleared his Agnya chakra.

00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.840
Then on My way back, he told Me that he raised him [unclear],

00:52:26.999 --> 00:52:29.480
hang him on a well before he [unclear].

00:52:29.880 --> 00:52:33.800
[unclear] they take you to tests to much, they do this,

00:52:33.999 --> 00:52:36.840
but there are many people like that.

00:52:36.999 --> 00:52:38.999
Another one who was here [unclear]

00:52:39.120 --> 00:52:43.000
[unclear] Realization and started making money and I didn`t know.

00:52:43.200 --> 00:52:45.880
He came back and he told me that he's doing very well.

00:52:45.999 --> 00:52:47.880
But the vibrations were very bad and we discovered

00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:50.880
that he was making money out of his vibrations.

00:52:50.999 --> 00:52:54.240
And I scolded him, I said, "Why did you make money like this?"

00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:55.880
He said, "Should I become poor man?"

00:52:55.999 --> 00:52:58.400
I said, "Whatever you were doing, as if you were a teacher...

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.160
Why don't you become a teacher?

00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.840
Why do you want to sell vibrations?

00:53:01.999 --> 00:53:04.000
Did I give you vibrations for money?"

00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:06.360
He said, "No, but I have to do it". He shouted at Me.

00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:08.880
But then he went away [unclear].

00:53:08.999 --> 00:53:11.240
And he went to see him [in Calcutta], this fellow.

00:53:11.440 --> 00:53:13.040
And the description is like this,

00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:15.800
because he came back and [unclear].

00:53:15.999 --> 00:53:17.880
He said that, "As soon as I went there he started,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.800
and the guru started throwing big stones at me.

00:53:20.999 --> 00:53:22.440
So [unclear] back to the station

00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.160
and the people from there came and told Me that

00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:29.040
"The guru is very angry with you

00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:30.360
because you went to Mother and misbehave,

00:53:30.640 --> 00:53:32.840
and he`s not going to talk to you.

00:53:32.999 --> 00:53:35.160
So he was quite surprised. He said, "All right,

00:53:35.360 --> 00:53:36.800
I've never seen this guru, please ask him."

00:53:36.999 --> 00:53:40.360
Then three times he went there and the guru was beating him,

00:53:40.999 --> 00:53:43.120
throwing stones at him.

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.880
But this fellow, you see, I think human beings have this habit,

00:53:46.999 --> 00:53:49.999
the more you try to discard them, the more they'll stick to you.

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:51.640
Otherwise if you're kind to them,

00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:53.680
they don't understand kindness perhaps.

00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:57.880
Then forth day [unclear]

00:53:57.999 --> 00:54:01.920
[unclear]

00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:05.880
[unclear]

00:54:05.999 --> 00:54:09.320
[unclear]

00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:14.840
But this fellow has been doing such wrong things, even now in a way,

00:54:14.999 --> 00:54:17.160
that he cannot come and see Me

00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:19.840
because he is making money out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:54:19.999 --> 00:54:21.880
He is calling himself as a Sahaja Yogi

00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:25.880
and he is curing people and he is trying to befool them.

00:54:25.999 --> 00:54:28.280
And surprisingly, he is an Indian but  I can't understand

00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.720
why he took to such a [gain].

00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.240
In India we have so many Sahaja Yogis, thousands,

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:35.240
but nobody does like this.

00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:37.999
I don`t know why he is doing like this, really.

00:54:38.360 --> 00:54:41.920
So this is what it is. There are gurus, many gurus,

00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:46.840
but they don`t want to have anything to do with others.

00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:48.999
They are very [unclear] people.

00:54:49.800 --> 00:54:52.999
I am [trying], yet I am not given up.

00:54:58.999 --> 00:55:04.999
Q: Would excessive fatigue have an effect of your Self Realization,

00:55:05.200 --> 00:55:08.400
or impair your powers of discrimination?

00:55:09.999 --> 00:55:12.360
Would excessive fatigue

00:55:12.800 --> 00:55:14.800
impair your discrimination

00:55:14.999 --> 00:55:17.240
and have an effect on your Self Realization?

00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:20.120
SM: Excessive what? SY: Fatigue, tiredness.

00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:21.640
Excessive physical exhaustion.

00:55:21.840 --> 00:55:25.120
SM: Excessive fatigue if you have is very simple to get rid of it.

00:55:25.320 --> 00:55:28.200
You see what you have to do, when you are having this fatigue,

00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.800
your right side is exhausted, all right?

00:55:30.999 --> 00:55:33.800
When put your left hand towards the photograph,

00:55:33.999 --> 00:55:35.840
because in the beginning you have to use My photograph.

00:55:35.999 --> 00:55:38.120
Later on you need not, but in the beginning.

00:55:38.320 --> 00:55:41.720
Even if My photograph is not there, you can put the hand,

00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:45.999
and raise your left side like this.

00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:50.640
Left. Raise the left side to the right. Like this.

00:55:50.840 --> 00:55:54.160
And put it here. Even for a heart attack it is very important.

00:55:54.999 --> 00:55:58.080
Even if you have heart attacks as hearth is [unclear]

00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:01.120
you can raise your left side, raise it up

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:03.880
take it out from your head and put it down.

00:56:03.999 --> 00:56:06.999
The fatigue will go away, you get balanced.

00:56:07.920 --> 00:56:10.200
But one should not go to extremes in Sahaja Yoga.

00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.999
You should work to a point then finish off.

00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:15.920
But once the energy is established,

00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:18.999
connection is established [unclear].

00:56:19.999 --> 00:56:25.240
We are very resistant, quite a lot. Look at Me.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:34.960
Q: I have something that is in away question

00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:38.240
but it's difficult for me to put it in that form

00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:41.120
so I would like just say something that

00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:43.760
that might make it so.

00:56:45.200 --> 00:56:48.480
I was listening with a friend yesterday,

00:56:48.999 --> 00:56:51.920
and listening just some wonderful music,

00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:56.440
and, and I had, I had some moments

00:56:57.040 --> 00:57:01.880
of, of real feeling, of real, and some more realization

00:57:01.999 --> 00:57:04.880
and sense of the beauty in the world

00:57:04.999 --> 00:57:06.400
than I have had in the past.

00:57:06.680 --> 00:57:09.920
It seems to be something that has been growing and developing

00:57:10.040 --> 00:57:12.120
with what I hear, what I see,

00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:16.760
as I am still quite a beginner on the spiritual path,

00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:21.200
but I have been on, long enough to feel this.

00:57:21.840 --> 00:57:25.999
And, and I was about to remark to my friend

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:31.999
that such a beautiful world, and yet it seems that the more

00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:37.480
the more that we do in a positive [side] in this world

00:57:37.840 --> 00:57:42.480
it seems, that there seems to be on the, always on the other extreme

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:48.999
more problems, more, more...

00:57:49.160 --> 00:57:53.999
things that are threatening, threatening us.

00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:59.160
[unclear] and in myself I feel that as I, as I haven't tried

00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:03.800
to develop spirituality, I feel that sometimes

00:58:03.999 --> 00:58:08.320
on one hand I have moments of this type of wonders

00:58:08.720 --> 00:58:12.400
and on the other hand more and more feelings of fear.

00:58:12.840 --> 00:58:16.080
So in a way, is like an internal fear that I hope

00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:21.160
that I will survive that exploding

00:58:21.360 --> 00:58:25.800
on, on the, without destroying myself in this path,

00:58:25.999 --> 00:58:30.400
and in a larger sense I hope that the world will survive,

00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:35.280
this period of so...SY [unclear]

00:58:36.999 --> 00:58:43.280
The basic conflict between what we see as a [unclear]

00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.880
consciousness and the beauty of things,

00:58:45.999 --> 00:58:49.120
for example the music he was listening to yesterday

00:58:49.320 --> 00:58:52.480
made him closer to [unclear].

00:58:52.880 --> 00:58:55.800
But yet on the outside he sees that struggle, that conflict,

00:58:55.999 --> 00:58:59.999
that fear and [he things what's the] solution

00:59:00.160 --> 00:59:01.680
and how the Realization....

00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:03.999
SM: You see that is what I say

00:59:04.120 --> 00:59:06.600
that unless and until the Realization is established,

00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.880
you don't become the master of the situation.

00:59:08.999 --> 00:59:12.240
Now wone must know that if you see a conflict or anything

00:59:12.440 --> 00:59:13.880
you don`t know how to master it.

00:59:13.999 --> 00:59:15.200
That is the point is.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.040
But if you somehow get your Realization established,

00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:20.440
then what happens is that you are out of it.

00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:23.280
Because you are out of it you can handle the situation very well.

00:59:23.480 --> 00:59:25.880
And you are amazed how things work out.

00:59:26.280 --> 00:59:29.920
How things work out and how it helps you.

00:59:30.040 --> 00:59:33.200
So you don`t have to worry. You become just the master.

00:59:33.400 --> 00:59:35.800
Because you are still not the master.

00:59:35.999 --> 00:59:37.720
That`s why there is the problem.

00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.360
But once you are the master you handle all the situation.

00:59:40.760 --> 00:59:43.160
Then what you do is to give others.

00:59:43.999 --> 00:59:46.320
You become so confident, you give others.

00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:50.200
Now for example now, Dr. Warren went to Australia.

00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.999
SM: Now the amount of centers is?
SY: Eight.

00:59:53.160 --> 00:59:57.200
We have eight centers, and at least three to four thousands people

00:59:57.400 --> 00:59:58.999
were realized by him.

00:59:59.999 --> 01:00:06.760
So once you become the master, then no, nothing can disturb you.

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:09.920
You have no fear because you are the master, You know how to handle.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:12.120
You are the master of the ship.

01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:15.720
When the ship is seaworthy and the master is an expert,

01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:17.480
he knows how to handle the situation.

01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:19.480
In the same way you become the master.

01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.000
That's the point is, you have to become the master.

01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:30.480
Make a choice. all right? The question is [unclear], please.

01:00:31.080 --> 01:00:34.999
Yes, yes, you tell. You are the [winner?].

01:00:35.600 --> 01:00:39.920
P: Teacher, on our spiritual journey, as we are seekers,

01:00:40.040 --> 01:00:43.999
how we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:48.240
SY: On our Spiritual path for Realization

01:00:48.440 --> 01:00:51.640
how do we know a true teacher from a false teacher?

01:00:51.920 --> 01:00:55.080
SM: It's very simple My child, I tell you to find out.

01:00:55.280 --> 01:00:57.880
First thing is that a person who is a true teacher

01:00:57.999 --> 01:01:00.120
he never takes any money from you. He has to give you.

01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:05.240
He doesn't take anything. He cannot sell.

01:01:05.999 --> 01:01:08.360
Secondly, the life style of that person

01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:10.480
is according to his own balance.

01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.999
Supposing I'm a carpenter,

01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.999
then I live like a carpenter in complete [unclear].

01:01:16.200 --> 01:01:18.640
If I am [not], supposing I'm a wife of such and such.

01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:20.480
All right, I live with that.

01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:23.160
But I am completely detached about it.

01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:26.440
Thirdly, a person who doesn't give you

01:01:26.880 --> 01:01:30.800
the experience of the Divine,

01:01:31.200 --> 01:01:32.680
is not true.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.000
Truth is what? Not such mesmerism.

01:01:35.200 --> 01:01:38.480
Now how to understand what is their experience of the Divine.

01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:42.160
Because Divine does things which human being cannot do.

01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.960
Like a flower becomes a fruit. All right?

01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:49.200
Now supposing somebody makes you jump, or shout, or scream,

01:01:49.400 --> 01:01:52.999
or makes you say some things going through mantras, this, that.

01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.600
Anybody can do, what's so special?

01:01:55.800 --> 01:01:57.999
Any human being can do it. You can always jump,

01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:00.880
you can always shout, you can do all kinds of things.

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:04.720
Somebody mesmerizes you, it's very simple.

01:02:04.999 --> 01:02:09.440
But if you get a cool breeze coming out of your head,

01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:12.480
and through your fingers, this cannot be done.

01:02:12.880 --> 01:02:14.880
This is divine.

01:02:14.999 --> 01:02:17.200
Anybody who does that, is a great teacher.

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.480
Otherwise you become the teacher,

01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:20.840
now why you want a teacher to be followed?

01:02:20.999 --> 01:02:23.999
You become the teacher. That is why is Mother's job.

01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:29.880
Mother is the best teacher I think because she is born teacher.

01:02:29.999 --> 01:02:36.920
She has to be. And the teacher who loves, who is compassion,

01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:42.920
Is very difficult these days. I wish there were some [unclear]

01:02:43.040 --> 01:02:46.880
But they are so [unclear], so difficult.

01:02:46.999 --> 01:02:50.880
Anyone of them takes My responsibility, I would be really happy,

01:02:50.999 --> 01:02:54.999
because to travel all over the world, like this, is too much for Me.

01:02:55.120 --> 01:02:57.240
But I couldn't find anybody who will give you

01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.880
that love and affection.

01:02:58.999 --> 01:03:02.240
They get so annoyed and so easily disturbed.

01:03:02.440 --> 01:03:04.880
that they want to go back to their places,

01:03:04.999 --> 01:03:07.400
they don't want to face you, what to do?

01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:09.720
I wish you people become experts

01:03:09.920 --> 01:03:12.999
and do the job for Me. You will do it.

01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.999
SM: All right?
SY: Yes.

01:03:16.200 --> 01:03:20.120
What's the vibration, always speak [unclear] and feeling vibrations

01:03:20.320 --> 01:03:23.720
but I don't have sensation of cold.

01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.120
SY: Good evening.
P: I [can] get vibrations.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:27.960
SY: What, what [unclear]?

01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.440
SM: Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:03:29.720 --> 01:03:31.400
No, that's the point. She said she feels

01:03:31.680 --> 01:03:33.760
that she is [frightened] of vibrations, but is not always cool.

01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:36.999
No, no, cool, it should be cool. It should be cool.

01:03:37.160 --> 01:03:39.840
If it is only vibrations then it's not all right.

01:03:39.999 --> 01:03:42.160
That means the cool breeze is trying to come in

01:03:42.360 --> 01:03:45.640
but there is still an obstruction. All right?

01:03:45.840 --> 01:03:48.600
It's all right. There is nothing wrong, it is all [working].

01:03:48.800 --> 01:03:50.800
It will not take much time. It's all right, doesn't matter.

01:03:50.999 --> 01:03:54.000
Just started [unclear], the feeling has started.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:03:57.840
But if it is the cool breeze coming in the hands

01:03:57.999 --> 01:04:03.080
and the cool, not very cool, but cooler type, then it is correct.

01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:09.280
I have two simple questions.

01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:14.999
The first is how to evolve [in collectivity as human race]

01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.440
from man to superman. Some people think this was suggested

01:04:19.720 --> 01:04:23.280
[unclear] India and Europe, that we have done so far.

01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.920
One at a time, yes. What is the first question? Let him.

01:04:27.040 --> 01:04:30.880
Maybe he wants to connect it with [You].

01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:38.280
And is Shri Mataji, the only manifestation of the Adi Shakti

01:04:38.480 --> 01:04:42.240
in a human body, [in these days].

01:04:44.999 --> 01:04:46.480
Man to superman.

01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.160
How we evolve, how we are evolving at this stage

01:04:50.360 --> 01:04:52.160
from man to superman?

01:04:52.360 --> 01:04:54.880
And is Shri Mataji,

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:58.760
the only one who is Adi Shakti in a human body

01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.680
on the Earth today?

01:05:02.999 --> 01:05:08.240
SM: One answer is...
SY: Sorry ,in this century.

01:05:08.440 --> 01:05:12.440
You better ask the question. And get the vibrations as an answer.

01:05:12.720 --> 01:05:14.600
[unclear], "Mother are You an Incarnation?"

01:05:14.800 --> 01:05:17.840
Ask the question, "Mother are You the Adi Shakti?"

01:05:17.999 --> 01:05:19.760
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:21.400
SM: Ask three times.

01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:24.360
P: Mother are you the Adi Shakti?
SY: Again.

01:05:24.640 --> 01:05:26.160
Mother are you the Adi Shakti?

01:05:26.360 --> 01:05:28.960
SY: Are you feeling the cool vibrations on your hands?

01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:30.400
P: Yes.
SY: That's your answer.

01:05:30.680 --> 01:05:32.840
SM: That's the answer. You are comfortable.

01:05:32.999 --> 01:05:36.440
SY: You can ask any question. It will give you cool vibrations.

01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:40.400
SM: And definitely human beings are, have to evolve.

01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:45.920
They cannot [unclear] unless and until they get their Realization.

01:05:48.720 --> 01:05:52.480
This is the way you can find out whether [unclear].

01:05:53.200 --> 01:05:55.960
All absolute questions can be answered.

01:05:58.160 --> 01:06:01.080
SY: Same, people can ask, "Mother are you the Holy Ghost?"

01:06:01.320 --> 01:06:02.999
[unclear]

01:06:03.120 --> 01:06:04.320
SY: Put your hands [unclear].

01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:09.720
I think the best you put right [unclear] on the left hand side.

01:06:11.640 --> 01:06:14.320
SY: Close your eyes.
SM: Right hand.

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:18.320
Right hand up [unclear].

01:06:18.480 --> 01:06:22.480
SY: Left towards Shri Mataji, right hand up in the air like this.

01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.160
No, like this [unclear].

01:06:26.840 --> 01:06:29.920
Ask it, in your heart.

01:06:36.240 --> 01:06:37.760
SM: All right?
SY: Ask it three times.

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:39.999
Yes, it's working out [unclear].

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:42.320
Put the hand at the back side, like this.

01:06:42.600 --> 01:06:45.720
facing like this, not [unclear].

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:57.400
He looks so [unclear]. I could not understand. How are you?

01:06:57.680 --> 01:06:59.999
Feeling all right?

01:07:00.200 --> 01:07:03.640
What a simple thing has worked out, yes?

01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:08.160
You should come and see Me again to see about it.

01:07:08.760 --> 01:07:12.320
[unclear]

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:15.480
SM: You are coming to the second?
SY: Yes, yes.

01:07:15.920 --> 01:07:20.720
We are having a seminar, at the weekend.

01:07:21.760 --> 01:07:24.680
about eighty miles from here. Very nice place.

01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:27.480
And i don't know, whatever it is.

01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.120
And those who want to come,

01:07:29.320 --> 01:07:32.960
should give their addresses to Dr. Warren.

01:07:34.160 --> 01:07:36.760
And today is the last day.

01:07:37.440 --> 01:07:39.960
And I'm afraid I have to say good bye to you.

01:07:40.080 --> 01:07:41.999
I hope I'll try to come next year,

01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.080
but I can't say that I'll be here.

01:07:44.440 --> 01:07:47.999
But in any case, let's try to get Realization.

01:07:48.120 --> 01:07:51.200
So we put our hands again, like this, and sit comfortable.

01:07:51.400 --> 01:07:52.800
SY: [You take your shoes out].

01:07:53.200 --> 01:07:56.480
Today I think all of you have [unclear] on the heart,

01:07:56.760 --> 01:07:58.960
[little while].

01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.440
On the heart, more on the heart.

01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.320
Put your left hand towards Me, and right hand on the heart.

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:18.040
And close your eyes,

01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:23.120
putting both the feet on the ground, separately.

01:08:23.440 --> 01:08:27.680
Separated from each other. Just put them on the ground.

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:44.640
Now put your hand on your heart, and just close your eyes.

01:08:44.840 --> 01:08:46.800
Just close your eyes.

01:08:46.999 --> 01:08:51.360
Close your eyes. Heart.

01:08:53.400 --> 01:08:57.000
Now, today, as it is the last day,

01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:00.400
let's jut be [receptive] about it.

01:09:01.040 --> 01:09:04.999
And you have to say,

01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:11.720
in your heart, with full confidence, "Mother, I am the Spirit".

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:15.400
Say it twelve times.

01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:43.880
You can feel the cool breeze coming out of your head, most of you.

01:10:44.920 --> 01:10:48.999
It's working very fast today. Let's see if it is there.

01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:55.440
Put your left hand towards Me.

01:10:55.999 --> 01:10:58.400
You can feel it first, and then with the right hand.

01:10:58.800 --> 01:11:02.080
See if the cool breeze is coming.

01:11:32.999 --> 01:11:35.600
All right? It's there. Most of you [have got].

01:11:35.800 --> 01:11:38.600
I'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini.

01:11:38.840 --> 01:11:40.680
Today it has worked much faster.

01:11:40.880 --> 01:11:43.999
But those who have not felt the cool breeze we'll see them [after].

01:11:44.120 --> 01:11:47.840
First of all, put your left hand in front of your Kundalini.

01:11:47.999 --> 01:11:50.280
Don't get upset if you have not felt. You'll feel.

01:11:50.480 --> 01:11:52.200
Because [unclear].

01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.999
Now left hand in front of your Kundalini,

01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.999
and right hand has to be moved

01:11:57.160 --> 01:12:00.080
here, front, below, front.

01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.720
Like that. We have to raise it now, ourselves.

01:12:08.840 --> 01:12:09.999
Watch your hand.

01:12:10.120 --> 01:12:14.320
Now, make your shoulders loose, and push back your head,

01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:19.800
and give them twist, and now a knot.

01:12:21.840 --> 01:12:24.400
We have to do it three times.

01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:29.999
Watch your hand with concentration, left hand.

01:12:30.160 --> 01:12:33.999
Now loosen and put the twist.

01:12:34.999 --> 01:12:36.999
And with a knot.

01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.000
Third time, 3 knots [have to do].

01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:56.120
One, two and three.

01:12:56.800 --> 01:12:59.240
Now see if you are feeling it.

01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:08.160
All right? You can put up your hands, in the air.

01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.280
And now put up your head,

01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:13.280
and say, "Mother, is this the Holy Ghost?"

01:13:13.480 --> 01:13:17.200
or we can say, "Is this the breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.999
Is this the chaitanya lahari of the Adi Shakti?

01:13:29.999 --> 01:13:32.999
Ask the question thrice.

01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:37.080
[All you feel it?]

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.200
Now let's see if you have cool breeze in the hand.

01:13:39.400 --> 01:13:41.120
All right? Got it?

01:13:41.600 --> 01:13:44.240
Those who are not feeling it?

01:13:44.999 --> 01:13:47.840
All right, you see Me. Let's see them. They are not feeling it.

01:13:47.999 --> 01:13:51.400
One or two. The Sahaja Yogis will come and see you, all right?

01:13:51.999 --> 01:13:55.200
[But you get it out, you get it all right,] there's no problem.

01:13:55.760 --> 01:13:58.880
Must be some problem there. Who is the gentleman there?

01:13:58.999 --> 01:14:00.960
There's one gentleman there. Can you see [unclear]?

01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:03.920
Dan, are you there?

01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:10.280
SM: This gentleman there.
SY: [unclear]
