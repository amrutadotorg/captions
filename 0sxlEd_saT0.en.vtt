00:00.992 --> 00:05.449
I'm really a proud Mother to see so many Sahaja yogis.

00:09.283 --> 00:11.157
And one must understand

00:12.783 --> 00:15.992
that even if you get few people as newcomers,

00:16.908 --> 00:18.158
they may be few,

00:19.783 --> 00:26.075
but one has to realize that each one of you

00:27.616 --> 00:29.575
is now a realized soul.

00:32.117 --> 00:35.741
Each one of you have grown so much

00:36.700 --> 00:41.199
that you can create a nucleus yourself.

00:42.491 --> 00:48.950
And after growing in a collective way together,

00:50.908 --> 01:00.491
now individually the seedlings have become strong shoots now

01:00.950 --> 01:08.950
and they can definitely be transferred into different places

01:09.449 --> 01:10.867
and work it out,

01:11.117 --> 01:13.491
because each one of you is a prophet.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.700
I wonder if you realize it or not.

01:18.950 --> 01:22.075
Of course you have got the joy of realization,

01:22.491 --> 01:24.908
the bliss everything you have got;

01:25.157 --> 01:27.117
you have grown up to that.

01:28.366 --> 01:31.033
Slow and steady you have achieved it

01:32.199 --> 01:36.366
and as you have grown as a tree now,

01:38.867 --> 01:44.324
every one of you is so important and so powerful.

01:44.741 --> 01:49.033
I know that few people come in, in a collective way,

01:50.157 --> 01:52.616
and you find it difficult in the beginning

01:52.908 --> 01:54.075
how to deal with them.

01:54.199 --> 01:56.366
Because they are still not grown enough;

01:57.283 --> 02:03.117
they are still not up to the point

02:04.033 --> 02:08.199
where they really realize their own importance.

02:09.158 --> 02:12.283
But you should all understand your own importance

02:14.117 --> 02:16.992
and your own quality that you have achieved.

02:18.033 --> 02:21.158
In any other so-called, fake organizations,

02:21.491 --> 02:25.075
for example say take a church:

02:26.741 --> 02:28.324
there’s only one priest.

02:31.992 --> 02:33.783
In the whole locality there is one priest,

02:34.033 --> 02:36.575
though he doesn’t know anything about it, doesn’t matter.

02:37.867 --> 02:39.908
But still there’s only one person

02:40.158 --> 02:42.157
who is authorized even by church.

02:42.575 --> 02:46.783
Everyone has to listen to one person.

02:48.867 --> 02:53.157
But here, now you all are dynamic people;

02:53.616 --> 02:57.449
each one of you is capable of giving a good lecture.

02:59.283 --> 03:02.908
Of course all of you can give realization very well,

03:03.241 --> 03:04.741
no doubt about it.

03:05.117 --> 03:07.324
In all your groups you must try

03:08.324 --> 03:11.783
standing on your own legs.

03:12.700 --> 03:14.533
Try in your own groups.

03:14.825 --> 03:18.741
Think of all the dimensions into which you can shoot off.

03:19.075 --> 03:20.449
Because now you are ready;

03:20.741 --> 03:25.158
you are now the prophets.

03:25.449 --> 03:28.158
You don’t have to depend on anyone as such,

03:29.867 --> 03:32.157
or you don’t have to depend on

03:32.324 --> 03:34.449
your fellow beings also for that.

03:34.783 --> 03:36.158
Individually you can do it.

03:36.408 --> 03:38.117
Though you are connected with each other,

03:38.366 --> 03:40.157
you all understand the same language,

03:40.449 --> 03:44.117
you have got the truth together and you are all together;

03:44.366 --> 03:47.075
But the dynamism must come individually into you

03:47.283 --> 03:49.616
and every one of you in your own sphere,

03:49.825 --> 03:52.117
in your own line can work it out,

03:52.366 --> 03:54.157
because you know all about Sahaja Yog.

03:56.616 --> 04:00.616
Now those who are half-baked may not know.

04:00.867 --> 04:03.533
They still are rationalizing maybe something,

04:03.825 --> 04:05.741
doesn’t matter, they will also be all right.

04:06.575 --> 04:09.324
But as far as you all are concerned,

04:09.575 --> 04:11.075
you are all prophets

04:11.908 --> 04:15.199
and as prophets you must stand up.

04:15.575 --> 04:17.741
Wherever you go, you talk of Sahaja Yoga,

04:18.033 --> 04:21.033
tell them that, “This has come to us, this is the light.

04:21.283 --> 04:22.324
We know everything.”

04:22.783 --> 04:25.658
I mean you don’t have any doubts about it, isn’t it?

04:27.616 --> 04:31.616
But the trouble is, that you feel

04:32.616 --> 04:34.700
that the others may not understand,

04:35.033 --> 04:37.741
they are stupid people, they are foolish people

04:38.700 --> 04:41.158
or they are ego oriented or they’re aggressive

04:41.449 --> 04:43.741
or they’ll do this to you or do that to you.

04:46.075 --> 04:50.908
It’s true, but you must know that

04:51.283 --> 04:53.825
there’s not only one person who’s fighting it out,

04:54.157 --> 04:56.992
there are thousands all over the world

04:57.283 --> 05:00.158
who know your language, who know your thing, and

05:00.449 --> 05:02.491
they all know the same thing.

05:03.408 --> 05:05.992
So you are not alone fighting it out.

05:08.491 --> 05:12.199
Once you know that, then you will be amazed

05:12.491 --> 05:15.157
how much power will start flowing into you.

05:17.283 --> 05:19.157
The more you think about it,

05:19.449 --> 05:22.117
meditate upon your Self now I would say

05:23.117 --> 05:26.199
and know that you yourself you are prophets.

05:27.158 --> 05:30.075
And then you'll see the dimensions into which -

05:30.324 --> 05:32.825
so many are My dimensions sitting here I can see that.

05:33.908 --> 05:37.491
So in every field, in every walk of life,

05:37.783 --> 05:39.033
wherever you move,

05:39.324 --> 05:41.992
you have to talk about it and tell people.

05:43.700 --> 05:48.449
Now there are certain things, we have made

05:48.741 --> 05:52.366
certain rules and regulations for Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis.

05:52.658 --> 05:56.658
That is just to see how many are really half-baked

05:56.992 --> 05:58.908
and how many are full-baked.

06:00.783 --> 06:04.741
That’s how we have made certain rules and regulations,

06:04.825 --> 06:08.700
because those who are really full-baked

06:08.908 --> 06:11.157
will accept them without any difficulties,

06:11.408 --> 06:13.117
they are absolutely there.

06:14.867 --> 06:16.741
Now as it is we know,

06:16.992 --> 06:20.241
there are many categories of people who come to us.

06:21.199 --> 06:24.408
The people who are top class get into Sahaja Yoga

06:24.658 --> 06:28.033
without any difficulties, they are top class people.

06:28.324 --> 06:31.658
They achieve their powers, they assume their powers,

06:31.950 --> 06:33.700
they start asserting their powers,

06:33.992 --> 06:35.700
they just become that.

06:36.616 --> 06:41.658
Like we say we have the complete pattern of the ring with us,

06:42.033 --> 06:44.449
and only we have to put the diamond there.

06:44.658 --> 06:45.867
And you find the diamond all right.

06:46.700 --> 06:48.324
They'll just settle down with it.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.908
But some people, even after realization,

06:52.158 --> 06:54.075
go a little bit this side, that side,

06:54.283 --> 06:56.366
Doesn’t matter, they’ll all come round.

06:57.158 --> 07:00.575
But those who are top-class people are still,

07:00.825 --> 07:02.408
I must say, are quite a lot.

07:03.533 --> 07:06.658
I mean, I can tell you I know so many gurus

07:06.867 --> 07:09.283
who are real gurus, not these these unreal you forget,

07:09.533 --> 07:11.491
and the fake you forget, but the real ones also,

07:11.741 --> 07:13.867
they haven’t got a single one like that,

07:14.117 --> 07:15.950
not even a single person.

07:16.199 --> 07:19.157
Like Gagangar Maharaj, he told Me very frankly;

07:20.075 --> 07:22.157
I said, “Why don’t you give realization to them?”

07:22.366 --> 07:23.658
He said, “Who gave me realization?

07:23.908 --> 07:25.783
I had to work very hard.” This, that…

07:26.117 --> 07:28.992
“All right,” I said, “You had a guru who gave you realization,

07:29.241 --> 07:31.533
so as a guru it’s your duty to give.”

07:31.783 --> 07:33.741
And he said, “I’ve given it to one person.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.908
I worked on him for twenty five years.

07:36.157 --> 07:37.741
I cleared his Agnya, I cleared everything,

07:37.950 --> 07:40.199
gave him realization.” “And what is he doing now?”

07:40.992 --> 07:42.658
He said, “Now you’ll meet him, Mother, some time.

07:42.867 --> 07:44.449
You must see this fellow, he is horrible

07:44.741 --> 07:48.199
and he’s the one who is now making money,

07:48.449 --> 07:49.908
running after women.”

07:50.158 --> 07:53.616
After realization, after twenty five years of his work!

07:53.867 --> 07:56.075
He said, “I have nothing to do with this man.”

07:58.867 --> 08:01.283
Now this fellow was called as Anna Maharaj.

08:01.533 --> 08:03.366
I said, “All right, I’ll have a look at him

08:03.616 --> 08:05.117
if he comes to Bombay.”

08:06.199 --> 08:07.950
So he came to Bombay and one of My disciples

08:08.199 --> 08:10.075
had invited him to his house.

08:12.157 --> 08:13.700
She’s quite a rich lady

08:13.950 --> 08:15.908
and she said, “Mother, Anna Maharaj has come

08:16.158 --> 08:19.616
and You had told that You would like to meet this man

08:19.867 --> 08:21.658
so he’s come here. Would You come?”

08:21.908 --> 08:25.616
Went there, he of course touched My feet all right and that,

08:25.867 --> 08:28.324
but he was smoking in My presence, just imagine.

08:28.533 --> 08:30.533
He touched My feet and sat down.

08:30.783 --> 08:34.616
He said, he started talking ill of his guru, first of all,

08:34.867 --> 08:37.157
the one who worked on him for twenty five years,

08:37.366 --> 08:38.283
can you imagine?

08:38.533 --> 08:40.700
I mean you are very kind people; you don’t talk ill of Me.

08:41.408 --> 08:43.616
I’ve not worked for twenty five years on you

08:44.408 --> 08:46.616
and look at him, he was talking ill of his guru.

08:46.867 --> 08:49.324
And he said that, “You see, my guru,

08:49.533 --> 08:52.658
why should he go to, why should he go to Bombay?

08:52.867 --> 08:54.199
Now, what is the need?”

08:54.449 --> 08:55.825
Because this fellow was making money in Bombay,

08:56.075 --> 08:59.199
so he didn’t want his guru to go there, to tell against him.

08:59.408 --> 09:00.992
“And why should he go to Bombay?

09:01.199 --> 09:02.366
He should not leave his place?

09:02.575 --> 09:04.700
He was all right on the, on top of the mountain.

09:04.992 --> 09:06.825
What was the need for him to come down?”

09:07.075 --> 09:08.867
and all sorts of things he was talking there.

09:09.157 --> 09:10.324
I said, “Really?

09:10.616 --> 09:13.324
That is your guru, you are not to talk ill of him.”

09:14.241 --> 09:15.533
He said, “But this is true.

09:15.783 --> 09:17.324
He need not have left the place, you see?”

09:18.241 --> 09:19.825
And he was still smoking here.

09:21.825 --> 09:23.199
I said, “All right, now I have to go.”

09:23.533 --> 09:25.867
With so many women around him

09:26.157 --> 09:27.575
pressing his feet, this that,

09:27.867 --> 09:31.867
taking a lot of milk and enjoying himself and smoking

09:32.117 --> 09:36.157
and talking in a very condescending manner

09:36.408 --> 09:38.658
to his, so-called disciples.

09:38.950 --> 09:41.241
Poor things, they were simple people you know.

09:42.241 --> 09:43.867
I said, “All right, I have to go now.

09:45.033 --> 09:51.533
So you just put some,

09:53.241 --> 09:58.825
I’ll give you some kumkum on your forehead.”

09:59.117 --> 10:01.783
So I took some kumkum and put it on his forehead.

10:02.575 --> 10:05.366
So his Agnya was just burning, oh,

10:05.575 --> 10:07.575
absolutely My finger went like this!

10:07.783 --> 10:09.825
I said, “That’s it.” “Now,”

10:10.075 --> 10:12.575
I said, “All right now can you I’m going now,

10:12.825 --> 10:14.491
you put some on My forehead.”

10:14.741 --> 10:18.158
And I sucked his finger inside, he couldn’t move it.

10:18.408 --> 10:21.408
Just like that, it was all …

10:24.700 --> 10:26.075
And he said, “Leave me, leave me,

10:26.324 --> 10:28.117
Mother, I’m sorry, I am sorry!” I said,

10:28.241 --> 10:31.408
“Now! You just promise you’ll not talk ill of your guru,

10:31.658 --> 10:32.950
then only I’ll leave you.”

10:33.158 --> 10:35.491
He said, “All right, all right, all right!

10:35.741 --> 10:37.199
Please leave me!”

10:37.491 --> 10:39.157
So I left the finger.

10:40.575 --> 10:44.658
But see now, the Sahaja yogini lady who was there,

10:44.908 --> 10:47.283
who has been saved from so many problems

10:47.575 --> 10:50.283
because she was a clairvoyant person,

10:51.867 --> 10:56.408
to her he told a lie, is complete lie.

10:56.616 --> 10:58.117
He said, “I was giving power to Mother.”

10:58.324 --> 10:59.950
You see they saw it from a distance.

11:00.157 --> 11:02.575
“So I was shaking because I was giving power” -

11:02.825 --> 11:04.783
you know, means this shaking was giving Me power!

11:05.825 --> 11:09.157
But this lady should have understood that when you shake

11:09.449 --> 11:11.366
it means there’s something wrong with you.

11:12.283 --> 11:14.825
And you know she said that, “Now I will give you

11:15.075 --> 11:17.157
also such powers as came to Mother.”

11:17.408 --> 11:19.283
That time it was just the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

11:19.533 --> 11:21.283
I should say, quite the beginning.

11:21.575 --> 11:25.491
“So now you better have a Yagya. Hom.

11:25.700 --> 11:27.616
For that all of you must bring

11:27.825 --> 11:30.366
one and a quarter tola of gold” -

11:30.658 --> 11:32.950
that’s about 10 grams.

11:33.908 --> 11:36.117
“and give it to me.”

11:36.408 --> 11:38.783
That was the beginning of the end.

11:40.449 --> 11:42.449
Now all their money, all their property,

11:42.741 --> 11:44.408
everything he sucked in somehow.

11:45.158 --> 11:48.992
And her sister met Me when I was traveling

11:49.658 --> 11:51.199
once from Delhi to Bombay

11:51.491 --> 11:53.324
and she just fell at My feet and started crying.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.575
I said, “What’s the matter?”

11:54.867 --> 11:57.158
She said, “Mother this fellow has looted us.” I said, “Who?”

11:57.449 --> 11:59.157
“The Anna Maharaj.” I said, “How?

11:59.366 --> 12:01.658
But that day you saw him shaking.

12:01.908 --> 12:03.199
That’s the thing.”

12:03.491 --> 12:08.324
So how she was befooled by this fellow

12:08.575 --> 12:10.741
who told her a complete lie?

12:11.033 --> 12:13.324
If she had seen the vibrations of this man

12:15.408 --> 12:16.908
it would have been all right

12:17.158 --> 12:19.658
and this is what Sahaja yogis forget.

12:19.950 --> 12:22.533
They are prophets, they have their powers

12:22.825 --> 12:26.741
but their power is their Spirit, is their vibrations

12:27.033 --> 12:31.117
and they forget it all the time that,

12:31.283 --> 12:33.950
“We have got a new awareness, vibratory awareness.

12:34.158 --> 12:36.658
We have to judge everything on vibrations,”

12:36.908 --> 12:39.616
and that’s the only failing point of all the prophets.

12:43.992 --> 12:45.449
If it is untruth -

12:45.700 --> 12:48.158
I am very innocent you know, I’m very simple minded,

12:48.408 --> 12:50.366
I just don’t understand things at all.

12:50.658 --> 12:53.199
You see I don’t know the crookery of man

12:53.449 --> 12:55.908
how he goes round and tells lies and this,

12:56.117 --> 13:01.491
but on vibrations I know what it is like - absolutely.

13:01.783 --> 13:03.158
You may tell Me any stories:

13:03.408 --> 13:05.908
with all your crookery, with all your intelligence

13:06.158 --> 13:08.575
and all your special sharpness.

13:08.825 --> 13:10.575
I know what you are up to,

13:10.825 --> 13:12.992
because only I know it with vibrations.

13:13.324 --> 13:15.033
But otherwise I am very simple,

13:15.324 --> 13:18.283
I can’t rationally or anything I can understand,

13:18.533 --> 13:20.533
but by vibrations I know where you are.

13:20.825 --> 13:23.575
In the same way you develop your vibratory awareness,

13:23.867 --> 13:26.283
its sensitivity and try to understand things

13:26.491 --> 13:28.241
through vibratory awareness.

13:28.575 --> 13:35.575
If you can do that then you will be perfect prophets.

13:38.033 --> 13:39.449
You’ll be perfect prophets.

13:39.741 --> 13:43.533
Now among ourselves also you’ll find there are people

13:43.825 --> 13:46.324
who are not up to the point.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.825
Such people should never be trusted,

13:49.117 --> 13:51.783
should never be trusted because they are half-baked,

13:52.075 --> 13:54.449
they might become negative, they might become positive.

13:54.741 --> 13:56.117
So they should not be trusted

13:56.324 --> 14:00.199
and they should be treated with little reserve.

14:01.449 --> 14:03.117
Once they become all right

14:03.366 --> 14:07.992
then you can take them into your own fold.

14:08.283 --> 14:10.408
For example recently a girl married

14:11.324 --> 14:13.283
somebody who is a great Sahaja yogi.

14:14.241 --> 14:16.533
Now because he said he loved her and all that nonsense,

14:16.825 --> 14:18.366
so I said, “All right baba you marry her.”

14:18.575 --> 14:21.075
But I knew that this one is no good, but what to say?

14:22.992 --> 14:27.700
And then this lady tried, actually she travelled with Me

14:27.992 --> 14:30.950
and she tried even to clutch My heart

14:31.199 --> 14:33.658
with the bhoots she had, absolutely.

14:33.908 --> 14:35.075
Twice she did it.

14:35.324 --> 14:38.867
So cunning, the spirits are so cunning in her,

14:39.117 --> 14:44.324
that when she went back to Australia, you see,

14:44.533 --> 14:46.950
she put up a show in such a way that,

14:47.158 --> 14:49.408
“Oh, she is so insecured

14:49.658 --> 14:52.616
and her husband doesn’t care for her and this and that.

14:54.533 --> 14:56.158
And the whole of that Ashram,

14:57.366 --> 14:59.366
just imagine, would have been lost.

15:01.158 --> 15:03.658
But I knew something was happening so I trunk called.

15:03.992 --> 15:06.158
Immediately I found out. I told them, now,

15:06.449 --> 15:08.366
"see her vibrations!”

15:11.950 --> 15:14.324
They said, “Mother we don’t find anything wrong with her.”

15:14.658 --> 15:17.157
That means they never saw her vibration to begin with.

15:17.408 --> 15:19.199
Because what happens once vibrations are lost,

15:19.449 --> 15:20.950
you can’t feel anything.

15:21.241 --> 15:23.117
She has engulfed all of them so much

15:24.117 --> 15:26.658
that they couldn’t feel anything about her.

15:26.992 --> 15:28.283
Can you imagine?

15:29.324 --> 15:31.157
Then rationally I asked a question,

15:33.075 --> 15:40.157
“Can you replace Warren for his wife?”

15:41.908 --> 15:43.616
And they got a fright.

15:46.408 --> 15:49.117
So, one has to be very, very alert about it,

15:49.366 --> 15:53.908
extremely alert as to these people who are half-baked.

15:54.157 --> 15:56.825
They will always try to pull you down.

15:57.117 --> 16:00.158
Half-baked people will always try to pull you down,

16:00.449 --> 16:02.783
unless and until you are firm enough to pull them up.

16:03.075 --> 16:06.658
Because they are not doing it, they are not aware of it,

16:06.950 --> 16:12.241
but they are under the possession of these people,

16:12.575 --> 16:14.117
and when they do something,

16:14.324 --> 16:18.241
they try to do all anti-God activities.

16:19.157 --> 16:22.575
Another one I’ll tell you was in

16:30.783 --> 16:32.449
Geneva.

16:33.366 --> 16:36.533
In the beginning I don’t tell openly about a person.

16:37.158 --> 16:39.449
As far as possible I don’t tell openly

16:39.700 --> 16:40.825
because it’s not proper.

16:41.117 --> 16:43.366
Give them a chance, they’ll come up,

16:43.616 --> 16:46.491
it will work out, doesn’t matter.

16:46.817 --> 16:47.984
I can manage it.

16:48.241 --> 16:51.117
But when the nuisance becomes a collective thing,

16:51.324 --> 16:53.533
then one has to talk about it openly;

16:53.741 --> 16:56.992
you see, because these people will go to one person,

16:57.241 --> 16:59.157
say something, another person something,

16:59.324 --> 17:00.324
third person something.

17:00.575 --> 17:02.283
So you have to be very alert.

17:02.658 --> 17:04.867
And they are not aware of it -

17:05.117 --> 17:06.366
that’s the best part of it,

17:06.616 --> 17:08.157
they are not aware of what they are doing.

17:08.408 --> 17:11.283
Like this lady in Geneva would go on asking everyone,

17:11.533 --> 17:14.158
“What do you think about Mr. X or Mr. Y?”

17:15.075 --> 17:18.825
All right, so you would say something, if you are negative,

17:19.075 --> 17:20.658
she would catch hold of that.

17:23.408 --> 17:26.741
Day before yesterday I was very happy when Ray told Me

17:27.033 --> 17:31.033
something good about Pamela.

17:32.033 --> 17:34.783
He said, “Pamela is a very artistic Lady.”

17:35.075 --> 17:37.449
When you start seeing good points in others

17:37.700 --> 17:38.867
it gives Me pleasure,

17:39.117 --> 17:41.324
it gives Me happiness, it gives Me joy.

17:41.658 --> 17:44.324
But if you start seeing bad points in another

17:45.658 --> 17:47.158
then I don’t like it.

17:47.449 --> 17:52.075
Sometimes of course when you - I also test you on that point.

17:52.283 --> 17:54.867
Sometimes I’ll say something, you see, deliberately:

17:55.157 --> 17:57.158
I’ll say, “All right something wrong with Ray” -

17:58.158 --> 17:59.408
I may say.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.449
I know about whether it is wrong or right,

18:02.700 --> 18:06.158
just to judge how far you can judge that person.

18:07.241 --> 18:09.700
Then if you say supporting

18:10.783 --> 18:12.908
to the right thing that he’s doing,

18:13.575 --> 18:15.491
then I know that you are right.

18:15.741 --> 18:18.241
I like it, I appreciate you,

18:18.449 --> 18:20.449
I really adore you for that.

18:20.700 --> 18:22.908
That whatever is the truth you should tell Me,

18:23.199 --> 18:24.950
because I know the truth,

18:25.867 --> 18:27.283
but I just play around with you

18:27.533 --> 18:29.575
to see what you think of another person.

18:30.533 --> 18:33.908
So try to see the good point in another.

18:34.157 --> 18:37.783
But on one point you should understand,

18:38.033 --> 18:40.075
if a person is quarrelsome,

18:41.992 --> 18:44.867
is trying to overpower you

18:45.075 --> 18:46.616
Birmingham we have a problem like that,

18:46.908 --> 18:48.867
which I have not yet exposed or said so.

18:49.117 --> 18:51.783
Still I have kept a secret but I am telling people

18:52.117 --> 18:54.117
that in Birmingham there’s a problem,

18:55.158 --> 18:57.825
and that problem comes from one person

18:58.075 --> 18:59.533
who is not aware of it.

19:00.324 --> 19:02.908
I will talk to that person; tell that person

19:03.158 --> 19:05.491
that he should get rid of this problem.

19:05.783 --> 19:08.783
But if he does not then I have to tell about it openly,

19:13.033 --> 19:16.658
because I don’t want Birmingham center to be lost.

19:16.950 --> 19:18.324
We would have lost Geneva;

19:18.616 --> 19:20.449
I tell you we would have lost it.

19:21.616 --> 19:24.158
Everybody went against each other

19:24.408 --> 19:28.283
and big problems were created, by one person.

19:29.283 --> 19:32.449
Though you are full-baked,

19:33.616 --> 19:36.575
still you are not so collectively aware

19:36.950 --> 19:39.324
and appreciative of others, as you should be.

19:39.575 --> 19:40.992
You are all one.

19:42.033 --> 19:45.366
Not only appreciation but you can’t do without each other.

19:47.825 --> 19:51.950
So slow and-steady, as the English character is,

19:52.658 --> 19:55.658
which is a very good character but it can be very slow.

19:58.783 --> 20:04.157
Slow-and-steady you must rise about, above your own shells

20:05.158 --> 20:08.199
and see the beauty of another Sahaja yogi

20:09.199 --> 20:12.158
and see the point that are good in that person

20:12.366 --> 20:13.449
so that you imbibe.

20:13.700 --> 20:15.741
Some people have certain capacities.

20:17.575 --> 20:21.992
And surprisingly then, I talked to Pamela about Ray

20:22.241 --> 20:24.157
and she praised him a lot

20:24.408 --> 20:27.616
and that really made Me extremely happy,

20:27.867 --> 20:30.825
though I must say Brighton may not have been

20:31.075 --> 20:33.658
so bright yesterday in the program,

20:33.950 --> 20:35.992
there were few people but doesn’t matter.

20:37.533 --> 20:39.033
This is very energy giving

20:39.283 --> 20:42.366
to see that Sahaja yogis appreciate each other.

20:43.491 --> 20:45.324
Now somebody has a problem,

20:45.616 --> 20:49.491
say left-sided people always have a problem in My lecture;

20:49.783 --> 20:51.157
they go off to sleep,

20:51.366 --> 20:53.741
naturally, they have to. [Laughter]

21:00.992 --> 21:02.408
It doesn’t matter whatsoever,

21:02.658 --> 21:04.575
I am working on them even if they are sleeping.

21:05.908 --> 21:07.324
But when I work on them

21:07.616 --> 21:10.783
I have to sleep Myself to go into them, see?

21:10.992 --> 21:13.741
So that drag is there, it doesn’t matter it will come up.

21:14.033 --> 21:16.033
There are ways and methods of how to work it out.

21:16.992 --> 21:19.199
But that’s not so important to Me,

21:19.449 --> 21:22.199
what is important is, are you sleeping

21:23.199 --> 21:25.157
towards your fellow men,

21:27.783 --> 21:29.616
fellow Sahaja yogis?

21:30.658 --> 21:32.533
Are you alert about them?

21:34.075 --> 21:38.241
They are just like your hands, eyes, nose, everything.

21:38.491 --> 21:39.992
You are all one.

21:40.158 --> 21:42.117
You cannot do without each other,

21:43.157 --> 21:45.616
because you are the only people

21:45.825 --> 21:48.449
who have now got the eyes to see.

21:49.533 --> 21:51.783
You are the only people who are aware.

21:55.158 --> 21:56.616
And we are not few.

21:57.616 --> 21:59.825
We think that we are very few.

22:00.408 --> 22:02.700
You see , maybe then the other gurus they might get

22:02.950 --> 22:05.157
thousands of them, they are useless -

22:05.366 --> 22:07.033
as they go, they come out.

22:07.241 --> 22:11.950
Maybe added up, tails and horns they might have!

22:14.117 --> 22:16.075
But they are not aware people.

22:18.366 --> 22:20.241
And you are aware.

22:21.283 --> 22:23.992
On one side you have to pull out the people

22:24.199 --> 22:27.283
who are not aware so much,

22:28.241 --> 22:30.616
on the other side you have to appreciate people

22:30.867 --> 22:32.241
who are more aware.

22:35.567 --> 22:37.733
And this is what one has to understand.

30:15.268 --> 30:17.642
with little less than what it is.

30:19.435 --> 30:22.268
I have to tell you, you should say it with little more,

30:23.517 --> 30:25.851
if you have to make the bull move you see?

30:26.726 --> 30:28.476
Say little more than you can say

30:28.726 --> 30:30.393
because whatever you say is not more, and

30:30.559 --> 30:32.185
this is the Infinite.

30:36.310 --> 30:39.351
But it should not be also so much that they can’t bear it.

30:39.559 --> 30:44.851
Like Warren had an experience which I told him,

30:45.018 --> 30:47.226
“Only tell the Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell anybody else

30:47.435 --> 30:48.934
because they’ll never believe it.”

30:49.851 --> 30:51.517
There was no petrol in his car

30:51.851 --> 30:53.934
and he had to go for a propaganda work

30:54.893 --> 30:56.393
and he went round.

30:57.475 --> 30:59.393
And he did all his propaganda for eight days

30:59.559 --> 31:02.726
and when they came back the petrol was not available.

31:03.018 --> 31:04.934
At the petrol pump the fellow said,

31:05.040 --> 31:08.558
“Your petrol is full, why do you want to have petrol in?”

31:10.104 --> 31:11.271
Why not?

31:17.313 --> 31:18.355
That can be done,

31:18.688 --> 31:21.146
but don’t tell anybody else because they’ll just say

31:21.396 --> 31:23.855
this is cock-and-bull story, you see.

31:26.022 --> 31:30.396
You see you have heard the story of the bread and the fishes.

31:31.146 --> 31:33.313
Because in the Bible it is so, we believe it.

31:33.522 --> 31:34.730
Why not today?

31:36.688 --> 31:39.022
You have seen so many things happening like that,

31:39.230 --> 31:41.980
I mean so many things in your own lifetime.

31:42.230 --> 31:44.772
But all these things if you tell them, they won’t believe.

31:45.104 --> 31:50.480
So your wisdom is in believing

31:50.730 --> 31:54.064
that you are in the realm of God and He is Almighty,

31:55.064 --> 31:56.605
and that He is going to give you

31:56.814 --> 31:59.146
everything that you want and aspire for.

32:04.188 --> 32:06.271
People won’t believe it I know.

32:08.230 --> 32:12.396
But it’s true, whatever is desired you can get it,

32:13.438 --> 32:15.522
but if you tell people they won’t believe.

32:15.772 --> 32:18.188
But as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

32:18.396 --> 32:20.355
you have to make a statement

32:20.647 --> 32:24.772
which is not reserved but open,

32:25.064 --> 32:26.605
with confidence.

32:28.730 --> 32:30.939
The diffidence that is put into it

32:31.146 --> 32:34.396
because of this training is not good.

32:35.563 --> 32:39.104
With confidence, “Yes it is so! It is so!

32:39.271 --> 32:40.730
This is what it is.”

32:48.688 --> 32:54.730
Like first when I went to India, Raul Bai,

32:54.980 --> 32:56.939
you know such an elderly lady, an Indian lady

32:58.188 --> 32:59.772
they feel little shy about everything.

33:00.105 --> 33:02.146
She’s the one with full hand up in the air.

33:02.396 --> 33:04.980
She was shouting, “Bolo Mataji Nirmala Devi!”

33:05.897 --> 33:10.146
and Modi looked at her, he couldn’t raise his hand, you see.

33:10.230 --> 33:11.522
He was a little shy.

33:11.772 --> 33:14.064
But she went thrice and then she lifted his hand and said,

33:14.230 --> 33:16.355
“What’s the matter with you, such a tall man?

33:16.563 --> 33:18.355
Why God has given you height for what?

33:18.605 --> 33:19.814
To raise your hands only.”

33:20.104 --> 33:22.647
And poor fellow he had to raise his hand.

33:24.355 --> 33:25.772
So that’s what it is.

33:27.563 --> 33:29.022
Have boldness,

33:29.271 --> 33:31.939
have complete confidence in your self,

33:32.146 --> 33:34.064
that you are realized souls,

33:36.897 --> 33:38.563
that you are prophets.

33:40.188 --> 33:42.563
Not to be upset or worried about things

33:42.814 --> 33:44.355
but you are prophets now.

33:44.688 --> 33:46.271
Assumption!

33:48.271 --> 33:51.105
In Sanskrit is said viraj.

33:53.647 --> 33:58.647
That is the energy is permeated -

33:58.939 --> 34:03.688
viraj: means enjoy that energy within you.

34:03.939 --> 34:05.772
Viraj, “Ra” is energy;

34:06.022 --> 34:10.313
“Viraj” means you enjoy that energy of that throne,

34:11.438 --> 34:12.939
assume it.

34:13.230 --> 34:16.605
You are the kings now, behave in that manner.

34:16.897 --> 34:20.563
It is not arrogance at all.

34:20.855 --> 34:22.939
A person who is a king is never arrogant,

34:23.105 --> 34:24.188
if he’s a real king.

34:24.438 --> 34:26.563
You see if they are borrowed kings then it’s different.

34:27.313 --> 34:30.230
But if they are real kings they can never be arrogant.

34:32.772 --> 34:37.939
So with that special type of royal behavior

34:38.939 --> 34:40.355
you will attract people.

34:42.855 --> 34:45.313
It’s not putting up show, is you are!

34:45.605 --> 34:47.939
On the contrary this is the reservation you are having,

34:48.146 --> 34:49.313
for what?

34:53.313 --> 34:57.480
You need not dress up like beggars or like dandies,

34:58.522 --> 35:01.271
but your dress should be such that you are a king,

35:01.522 --> 35:03.104
not bothered.

35:05.313 --> 35:08.104
And you’ll be amazed it will work out.

35:09.688 --> 35:14.605
You are the people who have the greatest of My time

35:14.897 --> 35:16.313
and company

35:18.104 --> 35:20.230
and also I know your language.

35:20.563 --> 35:23.897
I have given more speeches in English than in Mine own,

35:24.146 --> 35:27.438
My own mother tongue or in Hindi. Can you believe it?

35:30.688 --> 35:32.772
And so many Indians now,

35:33.022 --> 35:36.230
who did not much care for English after independence,

35:36.480 --> 35:38.104
are trying to learn English now

35:38.313 --> 35:40.355
and they are afraid that one day

35:40.563 --> 35:42.522
English may replace Sanskrit,

35:42.772 --> 35:44.897
the way Mother knows English.

35:49.480 --> 35:54.146
So, I have to make a very, very simple request to you,

35:54.355 --> 35:57.064
that assume, assume your powers.

35:57.230 --> 35:58.730
Assume.

36:01.522 --> 36:03.022
You are no more slaves.

36:06.105 --> 36:08.188
You are realized souls now.

36:08.730 --> 36:14.772
With this personality

36:16.271 --> 36:19.188
you will really enhance the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

36:20.605 --> 36:22.939
Unless and until there are flowers on the tree,

36:23.146 --> 36:24.563
the tree has no meaning

36:24.855 --> 36:27.772
and the flowers have to be up!

36:28.064 --> 36:29.146
They don’t hide,

36:29.396 --> 36:32.022
have you ever seen any flower hiding itself?

36:33.980 --> 36:38.897
They cover the whole of the body of the trees and fragrant,

36:39.105 --> 36:40.730
assuming their own powers.

36:41.730 --> 36:43.814
And the fragrance springs.

36:44.146 --> 36:46.022
Everybody knows the flowers are up,

36:46.355 --> 36:47.647
all the bees are round there.

36:48.438 --> 36:50.104
That’s how you have to be.

36:50.355 --> 36:56.438
Assume your powers - inside, outside, both.

36:56.688 --> 36:59.605
Not only inside, outside and in side.

36:59.897 --> 37:02.105
And they’ll be amazed at your confidence,

37:02.313 --> 37:03.772
at your compassion,

37:04.022 --> 37:07.022
at your capacities and the greatest of all,

37:07.980 --> 37:09.355
the complete vidya,

37:09.688 --> 37:13.188
the complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

37:13.522 --> 37:15.480
the complete knowledge of Kundalini,

37:15.730 --> 37:18.772
the complete the complete knowledge of Divine which you have.

37:24.772 --> 37:25.939
All right?
