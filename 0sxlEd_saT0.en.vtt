00:00:00.992 --> 00:00:05.449
I'm really a proud Mother to see so many Sahaja yogis.

00:00:09.283 --> 00:00:11.157
And one must understand

00:00:12.783 --> 00:00:15.992
that even if you get few people as newcomers,

00:00:16.908 --> 00:00:18.158
they may be few,

00:00:19.783 --> 00:00:26.075
but one has to realize that each one of you

00:00:27.616 --> 00:00:29.575
is now a realized soul.

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:35.741
Each one of you have grown so much

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.199
that you can create a nucleus yourself.

00:00:42.491 --> 00:00:48.950
And after growing in a collective way together,

00:00:50.908 --> 00:01:00.491
now individually the seedlings have become strong shoots now

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:08.950
and they can definitely be transferred into different places

00:01:09.449 --> 00:01:10.867
and work it out,

00:01:11.117 --> 00:01:13.491
because each one of you is a prophet.

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.700
I wonder if you realize it or not.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.075
Of course you have got the joy of realization,

00:01:22.491 --> 00:01:24.908
the bliss everything you have got;

00:01:25.157 --> 00:01:27.117
you have grown up to that.

00:01:28.366 --> 00:01:31.033
Slow and steady you have achieved it

00:01:32.199 --> 00:01:36.366
and as you have grown as a tree now,

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:44.324
every one of you is so important and so powerful.

00:01:44.741 --> 00:01:49.033
I know that few people come in, in a collective way,

00:01:50.157 --> 00:01:52.616
and you find it difficult in the beginning

00:01:52.908 --> 00:01:54.075
how to deal with them.

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:56.366
Because they are still not grown enough;

00:01:57.283 --> 00:02:03.117
they are still not up to the point

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:08.199
where they really realize their own importance.

00:02:09.158 --> 00:02:12.283
But you should all understand your own importance

00:02:14.117 --> 00:02:16.992
and your own quality that you have achieved.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:21.158
In any other so-called, fake organizations,

00:02:21.491 --> 00:02:25.075
for example say take a church:

00:02:26.741 --> 00:02:28.324
there’s only one priest.

00:02:31.992 --> 00:02:33.783
In the whole locality there is one priest,

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.575
though he doesn’t know anything about it, doesn’t matter.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:39.908
But still there’s only one person

00:02:40.158 --> 00:02:42.157
who is authorized even by church.

00:02:42.575 --> 00:02:46.783
Everyone has to listen to one person.

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:53.157
But here, now you all are dynamic people;

00:02:53.616 --> 00:02:57.449
each one of you is capable of giving a good lecture.

00:02:59.283 --> 00:03:02.908
Of course all of you can give realization very well,

00:03:03.241 --> 00:03:04.741
no doubt about it.

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:07.324
In all your groups you must try

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:11.783
standing on your own legs.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.533
Try in your own groups.

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:18.741
Think of all the dimensions into which you can shoot off.

00:03:19.075 --> 00:03:20.449
Because now you are ready;

00:03:20.741 --> 00:03:25.158
you are now the prophets.

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.158
You don’t have to depend on anyone as such,

00:03:29.867 --> 00:03:32.157
or you don’t have to depend on

00:03:32.324 --> 00:03:34.449
your fellow beings also for that.

00:03:34.783 --> 00:03:36.158
Individually you can do it.

00:03:36.408 --> 00:03:38.117
Though you are connected with each other,

00:03:38.366 --> 00:03:40.157
you all understand the same language,

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:44.117
you have got the truth together and you are all together;

00:03:44.366 --> 00:03:47.075
But the dynamism must come individually into you

00:03:47.283 --> 00:03:49.616
and every one of you in your own sphere,

00:03:49.825 --> 00:03:52.117
in your own line can work it out,

00:03:52.366 --> 00:03:54.157
because you know all about Sahaja Yog.

00:03:56.616 --> 00:04:00.616
Now those who are half-baked may not know.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:03.533
They still are rationalizing maybe something,

00:04:03.825 --> 00:04:05.741
doesn’t matter, they will also be all right.

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:09.324
But as far as you all are concerned,

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:11.075
you are all prophets

00:04:11.908 --> 00:04:15.199
and as prophets you must stand up.

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:17.741
Wherever you go, you talk of Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:21.033
tell them that, “This has come to us, this is the light.

00:04:21.283 --> 00:04:22.324
We know everything.”

00:04:22.783 --> 00:04:25.658
I mean you don’t have any doubts about it, isn’t it?

00:04:27.616 --> 00:04:31.616
But the trouble is, that you feel

00:04:32.616 --> 00:04:34.700
that the others may not understand,

00:04:35.033 --> 00:04:37.741
they are stupid people, they are foolish people

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:41.158
or they are ego oriented or they’re aggressive

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.741
or they’ll do this to you or do that to you.

00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:50.908
It’s true, but you must know that

00:04:51.283 --> 00:04:53.825
there’s not only one person who’s fighting it out,

00:04:54.157 --> 00:04:56.992
there are thousands all over the world

00:04:57.283 --> 00:05:00.158
who know your language, who know your thing, and

00:05:00.449 --> 00:05:02.491
they all know the same thing.

00:05:03.408 --> 00:05:05.992
So you are not alone fighting it out.

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:12.199
Once you know that, then you will be amazed

00:05:12.491 --> 00:05:15.157
how much power will start flowing into you.

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:19.157
The more you think about it,

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:22.117
meditate upon your Self now I would say

00:05:23.117 --> 00:05:26.199
and know that you yourself you are prophets.

00:05:27.158 --> 00:05:30.075
And then you'll see the dimensions into which -

00:05:30.324 --> 00:05:32.825
so many are My dimensions sitting here I can see that.

00:05:33.908 --> 00:05:37.491
So in every field, in every walk of life,

00:05:37.783 --> 00:05:39.033
wherever you move,

00:05:39.324 --> 00:05:41.992
you have to talk about it and tell people.

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.449
Now there are certain things, we have made

00:05:48.741 --> 00:05:52.366
certain rules and regulations for Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis.

00:05:52.658 --> 00:05:56.658
That is just to see how many are really half-baked

00:05:56.992 --> 00:05:58.908
and how many are full-baked.

00:06:00.783 --> 00:06:04.741
That’s how we have made certain rules and regulations,

00:06:04.825 --> 00:06:08.700
because those who are really full-baked

00:06:08.908 --> 00:06:11.157
will accept them without any difficulties,

00:06:11.408 --> 00:06:13.117
they are absolutely there.

00:06:14.867 --> 00:06:16.741
Now as it is we know,

00:06:16.992 --> 00:06:20.241
there are many categories of people who come to us.

00:06:21.199 --> 00:06:24.408
The people who are top class get into Sahaja Yoga

00:06:24.658 --> 00:06:28.033
without any difficulties, they are top class people.

00:06:28.324 --> 00:06:31.658
They achieve their powers, they assume their powers,

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:33.700
they start asserting their powers,

00:06:33.992 --> 00:06:35.700
they just become that.

00:06:36.616 --> 00:06:41.658
Like we say we have the complete pattern of the ring with us,

00:06:42.033 --> 00:06:44.449
and only we have to put the diamond there.

00:06:44.658 --> 00:06:45.867
And you find the diamond all right.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.324
They'll just settle down with it.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:51.908
But some people, even after realization,

00:06:52.158 --> 00:06:54.075
go a little bit this side, that side,

00:06:54.283 --> 00:06:56.366
Doesn’t matter, they’ll all come round.

00:06:57.158 --> 00:07:00.575
But those who are top-class people are still,

00:07:00.825 --> 00:07:02.408
I must say, are quite a lot.

00:07:03.533 --> 00:07:06.658
I mean, I can tell you I know so many gurus

00:07:06.867 --> 00:07:09.283
who are real gurus, not these these unreal you forget,

00:07:09.533 --> 00:07:11.491
and the fake you forget, but the real ones also,

00:07:11.741 --> 00:07:13.867
they haven’t got a single one like that,

00:07:14.117 --> 00:07:15.950
not even a single person.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:19.157
Like Gagangar Maharaj, he told Me very frankly;

00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:22.157
I said, “Why don’t you give realization to them?”

00:07:22.366 --> 00:07:23.658
He said, “Who gave me realization?

00:07:23.908 --> 00:07:25.783
I had to work very hard.” This, that…

00:07:26.117 --> 00:07:28.992
“All right,” I said, “You had a guru who gave you realization,

00:07:29.241 --> 00:07:31.533
so as a guru it’s your duty to give.”

00:07:31.783 --> 00:07:33.741
And he said, “I’ve given it to one person.

00:07:34.033 --> 00:07:35.908
I worked on him for twenty five years.

00:07:36.157 --> 00:07:37.741
I cleared his Agnya, I cleared everything,

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:40.199
gave him realization.” “And what is he doing now?”

00:07:40.992 --> 00:07:42.658
He said, “Now you’ll meet him, Mother, some time.

00:07:42.867 --> 00:07:44.449
You must see this fellow, he is horrible

00:07:44.741 --> 00:07:48.199
and he’s the one who is now making money,

00:07:48.449 --> 00:07:49.908
running after women.”

00:07:50.158 --> 00:07:53.616
After realization, after twenty five years of his work!

00:07:53.867 --> 00:07:56.075
He said, “I have nothing to do with this man.”

00:07:58.867 --> 00:08:01.283
Now this fellow was called as Anna Maharaj.

00:08:01.533 --> 00:08:03.366
I said, “All right, I’ll have a look at him

00:08:03.616 --> 00:08:05.117
if he comes to Bombay.”

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.950
So he came to Bombay and one of My disciples

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:10.075
had invited him to his house.

00:08:12.157 --> 00:08:13.700
She’s quite a rich lady

00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:15.908
and she said, “Mother, Anna Maharaj has come

00:08:16.158 --> 00:08:19.616
and You had told that You would like to meet this man

00:08:19.867 --> 00:08:21.658
so he’s come here. Would You come?”

00:08:21.908 --> 00:08:25.616
Went there, he of course touched My feet all right and that,

00:08:25.867 --> 00:08:28.324
but he was smoking in My presence, just imagine.

00:08:28.533 --> 00:08:30.533
He touched My feet and sat down.

00:08:30.783 --> 00:08:34.616
He said, he started talking ill of his guru, first of all,

00:08:34.867 --> 00:08:37.157
the one who worked on him for twenty five years,

00:08:37.366 --> 00:08:38.283
can you imagine?

00:08:38.533 --> 00:08:40.700
I mean you are very kind people; you don’t talk ill of Me.

00:08:41.408 --> 00:08:43.616
I’ve not worked for twenty five years on you

00:08:44.408 --> 00:08:46.616
and look at him, he was talking ill of his guru.

00:08:46.867 --> 00:08:49.324
And he said that, “You see, my guru,

00:08:49.533 --> 00:08:52.658
why should he go to, why should he go to Bombay?

00:08:52.867 --> 00:08:54.199
Now, what is the need?”

00:08:54.449 --> 00:08:55.825
Because this fellow was making money in Bombay,

00:08:56.075 --> 00:08:59.199
so he didn’t want his guru to go there, to tell against him.

00:08:59.408 --> 00:09:00.992
“And why should he go to Bombay?

00:09:01.199 --> 00:09:02.366
He should not leave his place?

00:09:02.575 --> 00:09:04.700
He was all right on the, on top of the mountain.

00:09:04.992 --> 00:09:06.825
What was the need for him to come down?”

00:09:07.075 --> 00:09:08.867
and all sorts of things he was talking there.

00:09:09.157 --> 00:09:10.324
I said, “Really?

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:13.324
That is your guru, you are not to talk ill of him.”

00:09:14.241 --> 00:09:15.533
He said, “But this is true.

00:09:15.783 --> 00:09:17.324
He need not have left the place, you see?”

00:09:18.241 --> 00:09:19.825
And he was still smoking here.

00:09:21.825 --> 00:09:23.199
I said, “All right, now I have to go.”

00:09:23.533 --> 00:09:25.867
With so many women around him

00:09:26.157 --> 00:09:27.575
pressing his feet, this that,

00:09:27.867 --> 00:09:31.867
taking a lot of milk and enjoying himself and smoking

00:09:32.117 --> 00:09:36.157
and talking in a very condescending manner

00:09:36.408 --> 00:09:38.658
to his, so-called disciples.

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:41.241
Poor things, they were simple people you know.

00:09:42.241 --> 00:09:43.867
I said, “All right, I have to go now.

00:09:45.033 --> 00:09:51.533
So you just put some,

00:09:53.241 --> 00:09:58.825
I’ll give you some kumkum on your forehead.”

00:09:59.117 --> 00:10:01.783
So I took some kumkum and put it on his forehead.

00:10:02.575 --> 00:10:05.366
So his Agnya was just burning, oh,

00:10:05.575 --> 00:10:07.575
absolutely My finger went like this!

00:10:07.783 --> 00:10:09.825
I said, “That’s it.” “Now,”

00:10:10.075 --> 00:10:12.575
I said, “All right now can you I’m going now,

00:10:12.825 --> 00:10:14.491
you put some on My forehead.”

00:10:14.741 --> 00:10:18.158
And I sucked his finger inside, he couldn’t move it.

00:10:18.408 --> 00:10:21.408
Just like that, it was all …

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.075
And he said, “Leave me, leave me,

00:10:26.324 --> 00:10:28.117
Mother, I’m sorry, I am sorry!” I said,

00:10:28.241 --> 00:10:31.408
“Now! You just promise you’ll not talk ill of your guru,

00:10:31.658 --> 00:10:32.950
then only I’ll leave you.”

00:10:33.158 --> 00:10:35.491
He said, “All right, all right, all right!

00:10:35.741 --> 00:10:37.199
Please leave me!”

00:10:37.491 --> 00:10:39.157
So I left the finger.

00:10:40.575 --> 00:10:44.658
But see now, the Sahaja yogini lady who was there,

00:10:44.908 --> 00:10:47.283
who has been saved from so many problems

00:10:47.575 --> 00:10:50.283
because she was a clairvoyant person,

00:10:51.867 --> 00:10:56.408
to her he told a lie, is complete lie.

00:10:56.616 --> 00:10:58.117
He said, “I was giving power to Mother.”

00:10:58.324 --> 00:10:59.950
You see they saw it from a distance.

00:11:00.157 --> 00:11:02.575
“So I was shaking because I was giving power” -

00:11:02.825 --> 00:11:04.783
you know, means this shaking was giving Me power!

00:11:05.825 --> 00:11:09.157
But this lady should have understood that when you shake

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:11.366
it means there’s something wrong with you.

00:11:12.283 --> 00:11:14.825
And you know she said that, “Now I will give you

00:11:15.075 --> 00:11:17.157
also such powers as came to Mother.”

00:11:17.408 --> 00:11:19.283
That time it was just the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

00:11:19.533 --> 00:11:21.283
I should say, quite the beginning.

00:11:21.575 --> 00:11:25.491
“So now you better have a Yagya. Hom.

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:27.616
For that all of you must bring

00:11:27.825 --> 00:11:30.366
one and a quarter tola of gold” -

00:11:30.658 --> 00:11:32.950
that’s about 10 grams.

00:11:33.908 --> 00:11:36.117
“and give it to me.”

00:11:36.408 --> 00:11:38.783
That was the beginning of the end.

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:42.449
Now all their money, all their property,

00:11:42.741 --> 00:11:44.408
everything he sucked in somehow.

00:11:45.158 --> 00:11:48.992
And her sister met Me when I was traveling

00:11:49.658 --> 00:11:51.199
once from Delhi to Bombay

00:11:51.491 --> 00:11:53.324
and she just fell at My feet and started crying.

00:11:53.408 --> 00:11:54.575
I said, “What’s the matter?”

00:11:54.867 --> 00:11:57.158
She said, “Mother this fellow has looted us.” I said, “Who?”

00:11:57.449 --> 00:11:59.157
“The Anna Maharaj.” I said, “How?

00:11:59.366 --> 00:12:01.658
But that day you saw him shaking.

00:12:01.908 --> 00:12:03.199
That’s the thing.”

00:12:03.491 --> 00:12:08.324
So how she was befooled by this fellow

00:12:08.575 --> 00:12:10.741
who told her a complete lie?

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:13.324
If she had seen the vibrations of this man

00:12:15.408 --> 00:12:16.908
it would have been all right

00:12:17.158 --> 00:12:19.658
and this is what Sahaja yogis forget.

00:12:19.950 --> 00:12:22.533
They are prophets, they have their powers

00:12:22.825 --> 00:12:26.741
but their power is their Spirit, is their vibrations

00:12:27.033 --> 00:12:31.117
and they forget it all the time that,

00:12:31.283 --> 00:12:33.950
“We have got a new awareness, vibratory awareness.

00:12:34.158 --> 00:12:36.658
We have to judge everything on vibrations,”

00:12:36.908 --> 00:12:39.616
and that’s the only failing point of all the prophets.

00:12:43.992 --> 00:12:45.449
If it is untruth -

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:48.158
I am very innocent you know, I’m very simple minded,

00:12:48.408 --> 00:12:50.366
I just don’t understand things at all.

00:12:50.658 --> 00:12:53.199
You see I don’t know the crookery of man

00:12:53.449 --> 00:12:55.908
how he goes round and tells lies and this,

00:12:56.117 --> 00:13:01.491
but on vibrations I know what it is like - absolutely.

00:13:01.783 --> 00:13:03.158
You may tell Me any stories:

00:13:03.408 --> 00:13:05.908
with all your crookery, with all your intelligence

00:13:06.158 --> 00:13:08.575
and all your special sharpness.

00:13:08.825 --> 00:13:10.575
I know what you are up to,

00:13:10.825 --> 00:13:12.992
because only I know it with vibrations.

00:13:13.324 --> 00:13:15.033
But otherwise I am very simple,

00:13:15.324 --> 00:13:18.283
I can’t rationally or anything I can understand,

00:13:18.533 --> 00:13:20.533
but by vibrations I know where you are.

00:13:20.825 --> 00:13:23.575
In the same way you develop your vibratory awareness,

00:13:23.867 --> 00:13:26.283
its sensitivity and try to understand things

00:13:26.491 --> 00:13:28.241
through vibratory awareness.

00:13:28.575 --> 00:13:35.575
If you can do that then you will be perfect prophets.

00:13:38.033 --> 00:13:39.449
You’ll be perfect prophets.

00:13:39.741 --> 00:13:43.533
Now among ourselves also you’ll find there are people

00:13:43.825 --> 00:13:46.324
who are not up to the point.

00:13:46.700 --> 00:13:48.825
Such people should never be trusted,

00:13:49.117 --> 00:13:51.783
should never be trusted because they are half-baked,

00:13:52.075 --> 00:13:54.449
they might become negative, they might become positive.

00:13:54.741 --> 00:13:56.117
So they should not be trusted

00:13:56.324 --> 00:14:00.199
and they should be treated with little reserve.

00:14:01.449 --> 00:14:03.117
Once they become all right

00:14:03.366 --> 00:14:07.992
then you can take them into your own fold.

00:14:08.283 --> 00:14:10.408
For example recently a girl married

00:14:11.324 --> 00:14:13.283
somebody who is a great Sahaja yogi.

00:14:14.241 --> 00:14:16.533
Now because he said he loved her and all that nonsense,

00:14:16.825 --> 00:14:18.366
so I said, “All right baba you marry her.”

00:14:18.575 --> 00:14:21.075
But I knew that this one is no good, but what to say?

00:14:22.992 --> 00:14:27.700
And then this lady tried, actually she travelled with Me

00:14:27.992 --> 00:14:30.950
and she tried even to clutch My heart

00:14:31.199 --> 00:14:33.658
with the bhoots she had, absolutely.

00:14:33.908 --> 00:14:35.075
Twice she did it.

00:14:35.324 --> 00:14:38.867
So cunning, the spirits are so cunning in her,

00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:44.324
that when she went back to Australia, you see,

00:14:44.533 --> 00:14:46.950
she put up a show in such a way that,

00:14:47.158 --> 00:14:49.408
“Oh, she is so insecured

00:14:49.658 --> 00:14:52.616
and her husband doesn’t care for her and this and that.

00:14:54.533 --> 00:14:56.158
And the whole of that Ashram,

00:14:57.366 --> 00:14:59.366
just imagine, would have been lost.

00:15:01.158 --> 00:15:03.658
But I knew something was happening so I trunk called.

00:15:03.992 --> 00:15:06.158
Immediately I found out. I told them, now,

00:15:06.449 --> 00:15:08.366
"see her vibrations!”

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:14.324
They said, “Mother we don’t find anything wrong with her.”

00:15:14.658 --> 00:15:17.157
That means they never saw her vibration to begin with.

00:15:17.408 --> 00:15:19.199
Because what happens once vibrations are lost,

00:15:19.449 --> 00:15:20.950
you can’t feel anything.

00:15:21.241 --> 00:15:23.117
She has engulfed all of them so much

00:15:24.117 --> 00:15:26.658
that they couldn’t feel anything about her.

00:15:26.992 --> 00:15:28.283
Can you imagine?

00:15:29.324 --> 00:15:31.157
Then rationally I asked a question,

00:15:33.075 --> 00:15:40.157
“Can you replace Warren for his wife?”

00:15:41.908 --> 00:15:43.616
And they got a fright.

00:15:46.408 --> 00:15:49.117
So, one has to be very, very alert about it,

00:15:49.366 --> 00:15:53.908
extremely alert as to these people who are half-baked.

00:15:54.157 --> 00:15:56.825
They will always try to pull you down.

00:15:57.117 --> 00:16:00.158
Half-baked people will always try to pull you down,

00:16:00.449 --> 00:16:02.783
unless and until you are firm enough to pull them up.

00:16:03.075 --> 00:16:06.658
Because they are not doing it, they are not aware of it,

00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.241
but they are under the possession of these people,

00:16:12.575 --> 00:16:14.117
and when they do something,

00:16:14.324 --> 00:16:18.241
they try to do all anti-God activities.

00:16:19.157 --> 00:16:22.575
Another one I’ll tell you was in

00:16:30.783 --> 00:16:32.449
Geneva.

00:16:33.366 --> 00:16:36.533
In the beginning I don’t tell openly about a person.

00:16:37.158 --> 00:16:39.449
As far as possible I don’t tell openly

00:16:39.700 --> 00:16:40.825
because it’s not proper.

00:16:41.117 --> 00:16:43.366
Give them a chance, they’ll come up,

00:16:43.616 --> 00:16:46.491
it will work out, doesn’t matter.

00:16:46.817 --> 00:16:47.984
I can manage it.

00:16:48.241 --> 00:16:51.117
But when the nuisance becomes a collective thing,

00:16:51.324 --> 00:16:53.533
then one has to talk about it openly;

00:16:53.741 --> 00:16:56.992
you see, because these people will go to one person,

00:16:57.241 --> 00:16:59.157
say something, another person something,

00:16:59.324 --> 00:17:00.324
third person something.

00:17:00.575 --> 00:17:02.283
So you have to be very alert.

00:17:02.658 --> 00:17:04.867
And they are not aware of it -

00:17:05.117 --> 00:17:06.366
that’s the best part of it,

00:17:06.616 --> 00:17:08.157
they are not aware of what they are doing.

00:17:08.408 --> 00:17:11.283
Like this lady in Geneva would go on asking everyone,

00:17:11.533 --> 00:17:14.158
“What do you think about Mr. X or Mr. Y?”

00:17:15.075 --> 00:17:18.825
All right, so you would say something, if you are negative,

00:17:19.075 --> 00:17:20.658
she would catch hold of that.

00:17:23.408 --> 00:17:26.741
Day before yesterday I was very happy when Ray told Me

00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:31.033
something good about Pamela.

00:17:32.033 --> 00:17:34.783
He said, “Pamela is a very artistic Lady.”

00:17:35.075 --> 00:17:37.449
When you start seeing good points in others

00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:38.867
it gives Me pleasure,

00:17:39.117 --> 00:17:41.324
it gives Me happiness, it gives Me joy.

00:17:41.658 --> 00:17:44.324
But if you start seeing bad points in another

00:17:45.658 --> 00:17:47.158
then I don’t like it.

00:17:47.449 --> 00:17:52.075
Sometimes of course when you - I also test you on that point.

00:17:52.283 --> 00:17:54.867
Sometimes I’ll say something, you see, deliberately:

00:17:55.157 --> 00:17:57.158
I’ll say, “All right something wrong with Ray” -

00:17:58.158 --> 00:17:59.408
I may say.

00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:02.449
I know about whether it is wrong or right,

00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:06.158
just to judge how far you can judge that person.

00:18:07.241 --> 00:18:09.700
Then if you say supporting

00:18:10.783 --> 00:18:12.908
to the right thing that he’s doing,

00:18:13.575 --> 00:18:15.491
then I know that you are right.

00:18:15.741 --> 00:18:18.241
I like it, I appreciate you,

00:18:18.449 --> 00:18:20.449
I really adore you for that.

00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.908
That whatever is the truth you should tell Me,

00:18:23.199 --> 00:18:24.950
because I know the truth,

00:18:25.867 --> 00:18:27.283
but I just play around with you

00:18:27.533 --> 00:18:29.575
to see what you think of another person.

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:33.908
So try to see the good point in another.

00:18:34.157 --> 00:18:37.783
But on one point you should understand,

00:18:38.033 --> 00:18:40.075
if a person is quarrelsome,

00:18:41.992 --> 00:18:44.867
is trying to overpower you

00:18:45.075 --> 00:18:46.616
Birmingham we have a problem like that,

00:18:46.908 --> 00:18:48.867
which I have not yet exposed or said so.

00:18:49.117 --> 00:18:51.783
Still I have kept a secret but I am telling people

00:18:52.117 --> 00:18:54.117
that in Birmingham there’s a problem,

00:18:55.158 --> 00:18:57.825
and that problem comes from one person

00:18:58.075 --> 00:18:59.533
who is not aware of it.

00:19:00.324 --> 00:19:02.908
I will talk to that person; tell that person

00:19:03.158 --> 00:19:05.491
that he should get rid of this problem.

00:19:05.783 --> 00:19:08.783
But if he does not then I have to tell about it openly,

00:19:13.033 --> 00:19:16.658
because I don’t want Birmingham center to be lost.

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.324
We would have lost Geneva;

00:19:18.616 --> 00:19:20.449
I tell you we would have lost it.

00:19:21.616 --> 00:19:24.158
Everybody went against each other

00:19:24.408 --> 00:19:28.283
and big problems were created, by one person.

00:19:29.283 --> 00:19:32.449
Though you are full-baked,

00:19:33.616 --> 00:19:36.575
still you are not so collectively aware

00:19:36.950 --> 00:19:39.324
and appreciative of others, as you should be.

00:19:39.575 --> 00:19:40.992
You are all one.

00:19:42.033 --> 00:19:45.366
Not only appreciation but you can’t do without each other.

00:19:47.825 --> 00:19:51.950
So slow and-steady, as the English character is,

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:55.658
which is a very good character but it can be very slow.

00:19:58.783 --> 00:20:04.157
Slow-and-steady you must rise about, above your own shells

00:20:05.158 --> 00:20:08.199
and see the beauty of another Sahaja yogi

00:20:09.199 --> 00:20:12.158
and see the point that are good in that person

00:20:12.366 --> 00:20:13.449
so that you imbibe.

00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:15.741
Some people have certain capacities.

00:20:17.575 --> 00:20:21.992
And surprisingly then, I talked to Pamela about Ray

00:20:22.241 --> 00:20:24.157
and she praised him a lot

00:20:24.408 --> 00:20:27.616
and that really made Me extremely happy,

00:20:27.867 --> 00:20:30.825
though I must say Brighton may not have been

00:20:31.075 --> 00:20:33.658
so bright yesterday in the program,

00:20:33.950 --> 00:20:35.992
there were few people but doesn’t matter.

00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:39.033
This is very energy giving

00:20:39.283 --> 00:20:42.366
to see that Sahaja yogis appreciate each other.

00:20:43.491 --> 00:20:45.324
Now somebody has a problem,

00:20:45.616 --> 00:20:49.491
say left-sided people always have a problem in My lecture;

00:20:49.783 --> 00:20:51.157
they go off to sleep,

00:20:51.366 --> 00:20:53.741
naturally, they have to. [Laughter]

00:21:00.992 --> 00:21:02.408
It doesn’t matter whatsoever,

00:21:02.658 --> 00:21:04.575
I am working on them even if they are sleeping.

00:21:05.908 --> 00:21:07.324
But when I work on them

00:21:07.616 --> 00:21:10.783
I have to sleep Myself to go into them, see?

00:21:10.992 --> 00:21:13.741
So that drag is there, it doesn’t matter it will come up.

00:21:14.033 --> 00:21:16.033
There are ways and methods of how to work it out.

00:21:16.992 --> 00:21:19.199
But that’s not so important to Me,

00:21:19.449 --> 00:21:22.199
what is important is, are you sleeping

00:21:23.199 --> 00:21:25.157
towards your fellow men,

00:21:27.783 --> 00:21:29.616
fellow Sahaja yogis?

00:21:30.658 --> 00:21:32.533
Are you alert about them?

00:21:34.075 --> 00:21:38.241
They are just like your hands, eyes, nose, everything.

00:21:38.491 --> 00:21:39.992
You are all one.

00:21:40.158 --> 00:21:42.117
You cannot do without each other,

00:21:43.157 --> 00:21:45.616
because you are the only people

00:21:45.825 --> 00:21:48.449
who have now got the eyes to see.

00:21:49.533 --> 00:21:51.783
You are the only people who are aware.

00:21:55.158 --> 00:21:56.616
And we are not few.

00:21:57.616 --> 00:21:59.825
We think that we are very few.

00:22:00.408 --> 00:22:02.700
You see , maybe then the other gurus they might get

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:05.157
thousands of them, they are useless -

00:22:05.366 --> 00:22:07.033
as they go, they come out.

00:22:07.241 --> 00:22:11.950
Maybe added up, tails and horns they might have!

00:22:14.117 --> 00:22:16.075
But they are not aware people.

00:22:18.366 --> 00:22:20.241
And you are aware.

00:22:21.283 --> 00:22:23.992
On one side you have to pull out the people

00:22:24.199 --> 00:22:27.283
who are not aware so much,

00:22:28.241 --> 00:22:30.616
on the other side you have to appreciate people

00:22:30.867 --> 00:22:32.241
who are more aware.

00:22:35.567 --> 00:22:37.733
And this is what one has to understand.

00:30:15.268 --> 00:30:17.642
with little less than what it is.

00:30:19.435 --> 00:30:22.268
I have to tell you, you should say it with little more,

00:30:23.517 --> 00:30:25.851
if you have to make the bull move you see?

00:30:26.726 --> 00:30:28.476
Say little more than you can say

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:30.393
because whatever you say is not more, and

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.185
this is the Infinite.

00:30:36.310 --> 00:30:39.351
But it should not be also so much that they can’t bear it.

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:44.851
Like Warren had an experience which I told him,

00:30:45.018 --> 00:30:47.226
“Only tell the Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell anybody else

00:30:47.435 --> 00:30:48.934
because they’ll never believe it.”

00:30:49.851 --> 00:30:51.517
There was no petrol in his car

00:30:51.851 --> 00:30:53.934
and he had to go for a propaganda work

00:30:54.893 --> 00:30:56.393
and he went round.

00:30:57.475 --> 00:30:59.393
And he did all his propaganda for eight days

00:30:59.559 --> 00:31:02.726
and when they came back the petrol was not available.

00:31:03.018 --> 00:31:04.934
At the petrol pump the fellow said,

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.558
“Your petrol is full, why do you want to have petrol in?”

00:31:10.104 --> 00:31:11.271
Why not?

00:31:17.313 --> 00:31:18.355
That can be done,

00:31:18.688 --> 00:31:21.146
but don’t tell anybody else because they’ll just say

00:31:21.396 --> 00:31:23.855
this is cock-and-bull story, you see.

00:31:26.022 --> 00:31:30.396
You see you have heard the story of the bread and the fishes.

00:31:31.146 --> 00:31:33.313
Because in the Bible it is so, we believe it.

00:31:33.522 --> 00:31:34.730
Why not today?

00:31:36.688 --> 00:31:39.022
You have seen so many things happening like that,

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:41.980
I mean so many things in your own lifetime.

00:31:42.230 --> 00:31:44.772
But all these things if you tell them, they won’t believe.

00:31:45.104 --> 00:31:50.480
So your wisdom is in believing

00:31:50.730 --> 00:31:54.064
that you are in the realm of God and He is Almighty,

00:31:55.064 --> 00:31:56.605
and that He is going to give you

00:31:56.814 --> 00:31:59.146
everything that you want and aspire for.

00:32:04.188 --> 00:32:06.271
People won’t believe it I know.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:12.396
But it’s true, whatever is desired you can get it,

00:32:13.438 --> 00:32:15.522
but if you tell people they won’t believe.

00:32:15.772 --> 00:32:18.188
But as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:32:18.396 --> 00:32:20.355
you have to make a statement

00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:24.772
which is not reserved but open,

00:32:25.064 --> 00:32:26.605
with confidence.

00:32:28.730 --> 00:32:30.939
The diffidence that is put into it

00:32:31.146 --> 00:32:34.396
because of this training is not good.

00:32:35.563 --> 00:32:39.104
With confidence, “Yes it is so! It is so!

00:32:39.271 --> 00:32:40.730
This is what it is.”

00:32:48.688 --> 00:32:54.730
Like first when I went to India, Raul Bai,

00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:56.939
you know such an elderly lady, an Indian lady

00:32:58.188 --> 00:32:59.772
they feel little shy about everything.

00:33:00.105 --> 00:33:02.146
She’s the one with full hand up in the air.

00:33:02.396 --> 00:33:04.980
She was shouting, “Bolo Mataji Nirmala Devi!”

00:33:05.897 --> 00:33:10.146
and Modi looked at her, he couldn’t raise his hand, you see.

00:33:10.230 --> 00:33:11.522
He was a little shy.

00:33:11.772 --> 00:33:14.064
But she went thrice and then she lifted his hand and said,

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:16.355
“What’s the matter with you, such a tall man?

00:33:16.563 --> 00:33:18.355
Why God has given you height for what?

00:33:18.605 --> 00:33:19.814
To raise your hands only.”

00:33:20.104 --> 00:33:22.647
And poor fellow he had to raise his hand.

00:33:24.355 --> 00:33:25.772
So that’s what it is.

00:33:27.563 --> 00:33:29.022
Have boldness,

00:33:29.271 --> 00:33:31.939
have complete confidence in your self,

00:33:32.146 --> 00:33:34.064
that you are realized souls,

00:33:36.897 --> 00:33:38.563
that you are prophets.

00:33:40.188 --> 00:33:42.563
Not to be upset or worried about things

00:33:42.814 --> 00:33:44.355
but you are prophets now.

00:33:44.688 --> 00:33:46.271
Assumption!

00:33:48.271 --> 00:33:51.105
In Sanskrit is said viraj.

00:33:53.647 --> 00:33:58.647
That is the energy is permeated -

00:33:58.939 --> 00:34:03.688
viraj: means enjoy that energy within you.

00:34:03.939 --> 00:34:05.772
Viraj, “Ra” is energy;

00:34:06.022 --> 00:34:10.313
“Viraj” means you enjoy that energy of that throne,

00:34:11.438 --> 00:34:12.939
assume it.

00:34:13.230 --> 00:34:16.605
You are the kings now, behave in that manner.

00:34:16.897 --> 00:34:20.563
It is not arrogance at all.

00:34:20.855 --> 00:34:22.939
A person who is a king is never arrogant,

00:34:23.105 --> 00:34:24.188
if he’s a real king.

00:34:24.438 --> 00:34:26.563
You see if they are borrowed kings then it’s different.

00:34:27.313 --> 00:34:30.230
But if they are real kings they can never be arrogant.

00:34:32.772 --> 00:34:37.939
So with that special type of royal behavior

00:34:38.939 --> 00:34:40.355
you will attract people.

00:34:42.855 --> 00:34:45.313
It’s not putting up show, is you are!

00:34:45.605 --> 00:34:47.939
On the contrary this is the reservation you are having,

00:34:48.146 --> 00:34:49.313
for what?

00:34:53.313 --> 00:34:57.480
You need not dress up like beggars or like dandies,

00:34:58.522 --> 00:35:01.271
but your dress should be such that you are a king,

00:35:01.522 --> 00:35:03.104
not bothered.

00:35:05.313 --> 00:35:08.104
And you’ll be amazed it will work out.

00:35:09.688 --> 00:35:14.605
You are the people who have the greatest of My time

00:35:14.897 --> 00:35:16.313
and company

00:35:18.104 --> 00:35:20.230
and also I know your language.

00:35:20.563 --> 00:35:23.897
I have given more speeches in English than in Mine own,

00:35:24.146 --> 00:35:27.438
My own mother tongue or in Hindi. Can you believe it?

00:35:30.688 --> 00:35:32.772
And so many Indians now,

00:35:33.022 --> 00:35:36.230
who did not much care for English after independence,

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.104
are trying to learn English now

00:35:38.313 --> 00:35:40.355
and they are afraid that one day

00:35:40.563 --> 00:35:42.522
English may replace Sanskrit,

00:35:42.772 --> 00:35:44.897
the way Mother knows English.

00:35:49.480 --> 00:35:54.146
So, I have to make a very, very simple request to you,

00:35:54.355 --> 00:35:57.064
that assume, assume your powers.

00:35:57.230 --> 00:35:58.730
Assume.

00:36:01.522 --> 00:36:03.022
You are no more slaves.

00:36:06.105 --> 00:36:08.188
You are realized souls now.

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:14.772
With this personality

00:36:16.271 --> 00:36:19.188
you will really enhance the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:20.605 --> 00:36:22.939
Unless and until there are flowers on the tree,

00:36:23.146 --> 00:36:24.563
the tree has no meaning

00:36:24.855 --> 00:36:27.772
and the flowers have to be up!

00:36:28.064 --> 00:36:29.146
They don’t hide,

00:36:29.396 --> 00:36:32.022
have you ever seen any flower hiding itself?

00:36:33.980 --> 00:36:38.897
They cover the whole of the body of the trees and fragrant,

00:36:39.105 --> 00:36:40.730
assuming their own powers.

00:36:41.730 --> 00:36:43.814
And the fragrance springs.

00:36:44.146 --> 00:36:46.022
Everybody knows the flowers are up,

00:36:46.355 --> 00:36:47.647
all the bees are round there.

00:36:48.438 --> 00:36:50.104
That’s how you have to be.

00:36:50.355 --> 00:36:56.438
Assume your powers - inside, outside, both.

00:36:56.688 --> 00:36:59.605
Not only inside, outside and in side.

00:36:59.897 --> 00:37:02.105
And they’ll be amazed at your confidence,

00:37:02.313 --> 00:37:03.772
at your compassion,

00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:07.022
at your capacities and the greatest of all,

00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:09.355
the complete vidya,

00:37:09.688 --> 00:37:13.188
the complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:37:13.522 --> 00:37:15.480
the complete knowledge of Kundalini,

00:37:15.730 --> 00:37:18.772
the complete the complete knowledge of Divine which you have.

00:37:24.772 --> 00:37:25.939
All right?
