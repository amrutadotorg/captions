1
00:00:07,760 --> 00:00:16,440
So the brain is controlled through the Spirit.

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,760
How?

3
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:29,960
That around the heart there are seven auras

4
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,200
which can be multiplied into any number,

5
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,840
seven raised to power sixteen hundred,

6
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:56,480
which are the ones which watch the seven chakras,

7
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:04,120
raised to power sixteen hundred - sixteen thousand, sorry.

8
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:14,480
Now this Spirit is watching through this aura.

9
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:17,680
Watching, I am again saying "watching"

10
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:21,000
through this aura.

11
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:45,680
This aura is watching

12
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:52,320
the behavior of your seven centers in your brain.

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,760
Is also watching all the nerves

14
00:01:55,960 --> 00:01:58,440
that are working in the brain

15
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,400
"watching", again.

16
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:14,120
But when you bring the Spirit into your brain,

17
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:20,360
then you go two steps ahead,

18
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:27,280
because when your Kundalini rises,

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,080
She touches the Sadashiva

20
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:35,520
and Sadashiva informs the Spirit.

21
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,520
Informs in the sense - reflects in the Spirit.

22
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:48,600
So that's the first state where the watching auras

23
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:55,320
start communicating

24
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,120
through your different chakras

25
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,280
in the brain

26
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,640
and integrating it.

27
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,560
But when you bring your Spirit to your brain

28
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,400
this is the second state.

29
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:21,880
Then you really become self-realized,

30
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:23,640
in the full way,

31
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,200
in the full way,

32
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:29,160
because then your Self, that is the Spirit,

33
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:34,280
becomes your brain.

34
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:41,280
Action is very dynamic, it opens then,

35
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:47,480
the fifth dimension in the human being.

36
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,280
First when your become realized, collectively conscious,

37
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:56,120
and start raising the Kundalini,

38
00:03:56,320 --> 00:04:00,640
you are in, you cross the fourth dimension.

39
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:06,320
But when your Spirit comes into your brain,

40
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,640
then you become the fifth dimension

41
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,520
means, you become the doer.

42
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,520
Our brain, now, for example says, "All right,

43
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,560
lift this thing up." So you touch it with your hand,

44
00:04:24,680 --> 00:04:27,960
you lift it up. You are the doer.

45
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,360
But when the brain becomes the Spirit,

46
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:36,080
the Spirit is the doer,

47
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:41,400
and when Spirit is the doer,

48
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:52,240
then you become a complete Shiva - self-realized.

49
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:56,920
In that state,

50
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:05,040
if you get angry, you are not attached.

51
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,360
You are not an attached person to anything whatsoever.

52
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:14,200
If you possess anything, you are not attached.

53
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,520
You cannot attach, because Spirit is detachment,

54
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,440
complete detachment.

55
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:27,720
You don't bother about any attachments whatsoever.

56
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,320
Even for a second, you are not attached.

57
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:39,040
Now I would say,

58
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:42,560
to understand the detachment of Spirit,

59
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:48,080
we should study ourselves very well, clearly.

60
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,040
How are we attached?

61
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,680
We are attached, firstly, by our brain,

62
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:59,120
mostly by our brain,

63
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,560
because all our conditionings are in our brain

64
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:09,800
and all our ego is also in our brain.

65
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,880
So all emotional attachments

66
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,400
are through our brain

67
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:25,560
and all our egoistical attachments also are through our brain.

68
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,800
That's why it is said that after Realization one must try

69
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,880
to practice the Shiva Tattwa

70
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,360
by practicing detachment.

71
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:50,440
Now how do you practice this detachment?

72
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:04,360
In the practice of Sahaja Yoga,

73
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,600
if you have to rise higher

74
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,520
you have to improve your own instrument

75
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,400
and not the instrument of others.

76
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,720
This is one thing one should know, for definite.

77
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:19,120
Now, you just watch your attention. Where is it going.

78
00:07:19,920 --> 00:07:21,480
Watch yourself.

79
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,400
As soon as you'll start watching yourself, your attention,

80
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,880
you'll become more identified with your Spirit.

81
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,160
Because if you have to watch your attention,

82
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,400
you will have to be your Spirit, otherwise how will you watch it?

83
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,680
So now see where is your attention going.

84
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:48,160
First, the attachment is, in all gross ways, to your body.

85
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:56,960
So we see Shiva - there's no attachment to His body.

86
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,640
He sleeps anywhere.

87
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:05,960
He goes to the cemeteries and sleeps there,

88
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,080
because He's not attached.

89
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,920
He can never be caught up by any bhoots or anything,

90
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:14,240
nothing of the kind. He is detached.

91
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:25,440
The detachment is to be watched

92
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,000
and seen through your own attachments.

93
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:36,680
Now, because you are realized souls,

94
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,040
not yet the Spirit, has not come into your brain of course,

95
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,480
but still you are realized souls.

96
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:45,880
So what you can do is

97
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,440
at least to watch your attention, you can do that.

98
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,640
You can watch your attention very clearly

99
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,040
by seeing where your attention is going.

100
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,600
And then, controlling your attention, also, you can do.

101
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:14,000
Very simple.

102
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:20,360
To control your attention you have to just

103
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:25,880
remove your attention from this to that.

104
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,400
Try to change your priorities,

105
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,080
all this has to be done now,

106
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,000
after Realization - a complete detachment.
