00:02.970 --> 00:12.285
I’m sorry what has happened yesterday, but I think the war has begun between the evil and good

00:12.285 --> 00:17.835
and after all the good prevails.

00:17.835 --> 00:31.567
In these modern times, evil used to prevail on good but now in this Krita Yuga,

00:31.567 --> 00:43.598
the evil will be completely conquered by good, and not only that, but good will spread all over.

00:54.945 --> 01:10.176
The evil has the capacity to go to extremes and then to fall out of the evolutionary process completely.

01:11.751 --> 01:23.800
Because they are blind they cannot see the good that’s why they are evil.

01:25.858 --> 01:33.412
If they could see the good they would give up their evil.

01:33.412 --> 01:42.189
In our country which is a country of yoga, especially Maharastra which is the country of the saints,

01:42.189 --> 01:48.355
I was amazed to hear what people are up to.

01:48.365 --> 01:57.096
One of the real source of this nonsense seems to be Rajneesh, the horrible fellow, because

01:57.106 --> 02:05.655
he has made an exhibition here absolutely denouncing all the deities and saying all

02:05.665 --> 02:12.295
kinds of dirty things, and I think the chief
minister of this place is also hand in glove

02:12.305 --> 02:20.086
with him and they are all trying to prove that there is no God, there is no spirituality.

02:20.096 --> 02:30.125
They want to establish that science is everything.

02:30.135 --> 02:38.816
We have no heritage of science in India, we have the heritage of spirituality.

02:38.826 --> 02:48.026
I mean nobody is known as such a great scientist
in this country.

02:48.036 --> 02:57.696
Nobody has made any special inventions and the way people are organising it in the name

02:57.706 --> 03:03.506
of science, there is hardly anyone who has done anything of science.

03:03.516 --> 03:10.805
So it’s the evil which has taken this new form of talking about science and denouncing God

03:10.805 --> 03:16.862
Of course in the West also the same thing has happened to a great extent but not to that extent.

03:16.862 --> 03:22.350
They have not discarded everything that was spiritual.

03:22.679 --> 03:29.117
But here they have gone headlong, those few people who are there, very, very few, but they are there.

03:29.117 --> 03:37.257
So it’s a very bad growth in this country, it won’t survive I know, it cannot survive

03:37.257 --> 03:40.995
because this country is so full of spirituality.

03:40.995 --> 03:48.528
In the West, because people took to science, they have lost all culture of society.

03:48.528 --> 03:52.505
There is no culture of society.

03:52.505 --> 03:59.005
The etiquettes are limited to fork and spoon or how you wish each other.

03:59.005 --> 04:00.887
There is no other culture.

04:00.887 --> 04:04.727
It’s so outside, there is nothing deep really.

04:04.727 --> 04:12.339
Because they have taken absolutely to the modern, or we can say that

04:12.339 --> 04:27.040
it's the industrial evolution of the people, they have taken to all that and have lost contact with reality.

04:27.587 --> 04:37.099
The culture of any country can only survive on spirituality.

04:37.099 --> 04:50.746
Science cannot talk of this and it has so many limitations that it cannot even answer simple few questions that are facing them.

04:50.746 --> 05:05.809
Above all they have no idea what is love, they have no idea what is the all pervading Power.

05:05.809 --> 05:12.390
Now you all have felt it, and you know what it is, and you know how to use it.

05:12.390 --> 05:15.538
So, under these circumstances I find

05:15.538 --> 05:26.996
that those people who are mediocres in Sahaja Yoga cannot help much  for establishing goodness.

05:26.996 --> 05:32.756
You have to be very clean within yourself, you have to be very powerful within yourself

05:32.756 --> 05:36.091
and you have to be extremely sensitive.

05:36.091 --> 05:43.731
So, we are not to waste our energy, our attention onto superficial and nonsensical things.

05:43.731 --> 05:49.543
We have to get out of it and we have to become
people who are detached,

05:49.543 --> 05:52.542
detached from any things which create problems.

05:52.542 --> 06:03.060
If you take a detached view of everything you will have a kind of

06:03.060 --> 06:13.200
a life that will nourish your society which is now sick, is a sick society, is a decadent society.

06:13.200 --> 06:19.584
And for that decadent society you need people who are very morally strong,

06:19.584 --> 06:26.308
who are tremendously pure and who know everything about Sahaja Yoga.

06:26.936 --> 06:32.818
The mediocrity in Sahaja Yoga is very common in the West, very common.

06:32.818 --> 06:37.716
And so much involved into their personal problems that

06:37.716 --> 06:47.990
I cannot understand how will they rise above this nonsensical, personal viewpoint of view.

06:48.375 --> 06:54.285
So, one has to realise that the whole tree that has grown outside so much

06:54.285 --> 07:00.862
due to industrial revolution has to seek its own nourishment

07:00.862 --> 07:05.188
from spirituality which is in India. No doubt.

07:05.600 --> 07:12.037
Spirituality without development has no meaning.

07:12.356 --> 07:17.974
Spirituality has to have development outside otherwise it is lost in the Mother Earth.

07:17.974 --> 07:23.890
It has to sprout and it has to show results, which we are showing no doubt.

07:23.890 --> 07:28.176
In so many ways Indian Sahaja Yogis are trying to show that,

07:28.176 --> 07:31.551
though they are rather slow about that point.

07:31.551 --> 07:36.807
So, it’s something funny that in the West people are rather slow,

07:36.807 --> 07:41.706
Sahaja Yogis are rather slow about their spirituality,

07:41.706 --> 07:50.204
and in India people are rather slow about their manifestation outside.

07:53.329 --> 07:57.466
Unless and until we really do some dedicated effort

07:57.466 --> 08:01.094
it’s not going to work out.

08:01.094 --> 08:07.940
So I hope as we have circulated letters that we have come here

08:07.940 --> 08:16.536
not for fun but for dedication and for our ascent and it’s a pilgrimage.

08:17.809 --> 08:26.608
Talking loose, talking about small things, quarrelling with each other

08:26.608 --> 08:32.964
is out of question of course. But domination, terrible domination

08:32.964 --> 08:37.854
of falsehood, just to think that you are leaders,

08:37.854 --> 08:45.094
or, "Why is he leader?" you know, shows that we are not yet worthy.

08:45.094 --> 08:52.554
So, the worthiness of a ship is very important if it has to fight the turbulence of the sea.

08:52.554 --> 08:59.418
If it cannot fight the turbulence of the sea then it is definitely not seaworthy

08:59.418 --> 09:04.595
and it is absolutely useless because it cannot go across.

09:04.595 --> 09:07.499
In the same way, if you have to be something,

09:07.499 --> 09:11.772
you have to work it out in such a manner that you really become worthy

09:11.772 --> 09:18.412
of crossing this ocean of illusion and that many could cross with you.

09:20.115 --> 09:26.649
As in India they have started at every place,
at every home, at every family, a center.

09:27.417 --> 09:30.716
If they invite people, they talk about nothing
but Sahaja Yoga.

09:30.716 --> 09:36.641
Now you can go all out to talk about it, I give you permission to tell them that I have come

09:36.641 --> 09:39.346
there’s nothing to hide.

09:39.356 --> 09:48.018
And you have to go and open the doors

09:48.018 --> 09:57.079
of many churches and many temples and many organisations and tell them that I am there.

09:57.079 --> 10:00.979
Now the time has come, you can see it so clearly, it’s so obvious.

10:01.420 --> 10:06.400
First, I used to say, "I would not go to the newspapers, this not good that’s not good,

10:06.400 --> 10:08.336
let us work it out."

10:08.336 --> 10:11.834
But it has come now so much, that I have to say things and I am going to say them,

10:11.834 --> 10:15.790
very openly, I am going to say them.

10:15.790 --> 10:18.807
But I want all of you to be such

10:18.807 --> 10:29.710
that nobody should point out a finger at you to say, "Oh, this is a Sahaja Yogi.

10:29.710 --> 10:33.841
And how this Sahaja Yogi is behaving."

10:33.841 --> 10:41.993
If somebody is stupid and not working it out, it's better to get rid of such a person.

10:41.993 --> 10:46.777
Or else help that person and tell him that, "You have to come up.

10:46.777 --> 10:50.439
You can’t be here, we don’t want mediocre people here.

10:50.439 --> 10:57.267
We want some very extraordinarily, pure people.“

10:57.267 --> 11:00.305
The purity is the main point which we have to have.

11:00.305 --> 11:03.906
Once you are pure you don’t have to worry, then I look after you.

11:03.906 --> 11:11.882
But the purity of mind, purity of heart and the purity of your attention, these three things are very important.

11:12.162 --> 11:17.636
When it works out, you’ll be surprised collectivity will grow in no time.

11:17.636 --> 11:24.532
Is a tendency among Sahaja Yogis also, still, to go back to the same materialism

11:24.532 --> 11:30.677
and to try to have your own house, your family, your
children- sort of a nonsense.

11:30.677 --> 11:35.385
We have to be in the ashrams and we have to work it out,

11:35.385 --> 11:40.097
we have to work it out very beautifully that we all live very happily in the ashram.

11:40.176 --> 11:47.106
But I find still people cannot work it out that way.

11:48.246 --> 11:51.959
They are more concerned about their jobs, concerned about their things.

11:51.959 --> 11:55.759
Once you live in the ashram I’ll see that you get everything.

11:55.993 --> 12:04.403
But if you do not want to have the blessings
of God, how can anybody help you?

12:04.403 --> 12:06.993
So, tremendous sacrifice is needed.

12:06.993 --> 12:10.739
Of course, as you know in Sahaja Yoga I don’t need any money from you at all,

12:10.881 --> 12:18.274
but sacrifice is very important, and sacrifice of nonsensical ideas that you have.

12:19.013 --> 12:22.355
In every way we have to show that we are Sahaja
Yogis.

12:22.355 --> 12:26.174
The way you dress up, the way you live, the way you think, the way you behave,

12:26.174 --> 12:28.430
the way you have relationships with each other

12:28.430 --> 12:31.108
and the way you lead your married life

12:31.108 --> 12:36.080
and the way you look at your children.

12:37.885 --> 12:43.447
Unless and until you have purity the light of love will not shine,

12:43.447 --> 12:46.627
the light of love will not shine.

12:46.627 --> 12:51.986
You have to absorb the light of love within yourself.

12:52.176 --> 12:56.107
But you cannot unless and until you are a pure personality.

12:56.107 --> 13:03.944
And that pure personality has to develop by your meditation, by working hard, it’s a question of few years.

13:03.944 --> 13:07.784
In ten years we can change the whole world,
in ten years!

13:07.784 --> 13:10.496
But you have to be really very dedicated.

13:16.389 --> 13:21.050
It is you who has to change, not Me.

13:21.050 --> 13:24.930
You have to work it out, not Me.

13:25.492 --> 13:31.182
I have done my level best but within ten years it should be possible that every Sahaja Yogi

13:31.182 --> 13:34.761
should become a tremendous force of Sahaja Yoga.

13:34.761 --> 13:38.271
So, please try to avoid all those who are mediocres.

13:38.271 --> 13:44.423
If you find mediocrity, the leaders must go all out to correct them,

13:44.423 --> 13:47.187
all out to tell them off. Don’t tolerate.

13:47.187 --> 13:51.666
You don’t have to be very mild on this point.

13:51.666 --> 13:58.397
You have to tell them frankly that, "See now, you are an extremely mediocre person for Sahaja Yoga.

13:58.397 --> 14:01.681
It's not meant for mediocres.

14:01.681 --> 14:05.710
It's not meant for foolish people, it's not meant for stupid people,

14:05.710 --> 14:13.170
it’s meant for something who are ready to sacrifice anything for the sake of truth.“

14:13.349 --> 14:17.719
These people are saying that, "Why don’t you go the way of science?"

14:17.719 --> 14:22.427
I say, "Why don’t you go the way of truth?"

14:22.427 --> 14:24.627
Take to truth.

14:24.627 --> 14:29.349
Science is not truth. Today it might appear, tomorrow it disappears.

14:29.946 --> 14:33.848
Today you may think it is correct but every hypothesis is challenged,

14:33.848 --> 14:38.612
every law is challenged, that’s no law.

14:39.005 --> 14:42.728
You have to use Sahaja Yoga in every practical life, everywhere.

14:42.728 --> 14:45.348
But in no way you have to be fanatic about it.

14:45.470 --> 14:50.672
Like I have seen some people start giving vibrations

14:50.672 --> 14:56.846
or they start moving their hands for bandhans,

14:56.846 --> 14:59.655
even if I am sitting, they are doing like that.

14:59.655 --> 15:07.455
There is no stupidity about it, it has to be very dignified, decent and decorous.

15:09.205 --> 15:14.731
But for that we need really people of quality.

15:14.731 --> 15:19.198
And a complete obedience is needed I must say.

15:19.759 --> 15:25.782
I have told Indian people that time that they must have a proper case done for them.

15:25.782 --> 15:28.982
They just didn’t listen to Me that time, they said, "Mother, why do you want,

15:28.982 --> 15:31.390
you know, you'll be in trouble and all that".

15:31.573 --> 15:36.153
If they had listened to Me there would have been no trouble today.

15:37.538 --> 15:42.482
But you must listen to Me what I say, don’t give Me explanations, don’t give Me logic,

15:42.482 --> 15:45.262
but I know everything you know that.

15:45.262 --> 15:49.695
I know everything.

15:49.912 --> 15:54.112
Now we have something good for you is the list of the marriages.

15:54.112 --> 15:58.772
But marriage is not such an important thing that you think about.

15:59.886 --> 16:05.236
It’s not such an important thing for you that you dedicate all your attention to that.

16:05.236 --> 16:09.380
It’s just by the way, because you have to have a marriage, that’s why.

16:09.380 --> 16:12.240
There’s no need even to have sometimes.

16:12.755 --> 16:20.492
But you have to have it, and then letters after letters about your marriages, about your children, I just don’t want to read that.

16:20.771 --> 16:24.679
Nothing about Sahaja Yoga.

16:26.007 --> 16:30.977
If you are detached, whatever may be the quality of your wife, you will not fall,

16:30.977 --> 16:33.870
whatever may be the quality of your husband, you will not fall.

16:34.049 --> 16:43.286
So one has to be little concerned that: what are we doing?

16:43.286 --> 16:45.807
What have we achieved?

16:46.176 --> 16:51.935
What are we going to give to the world?

16:56.232 --> 17:02.196
For Me, you are my instruments. I don’t have to ask anybody else.

17:02.196 --> 17:05.788
You are my instruments and you have to work it out.

17:05.788 --> 17:11.279
You are not for Me useless people, I worked very hard with you, very hard.

17:11.430 --> 17:14.811
So please don’t waste my energies also

17:14.811 --> 17:21.330
and try to become very good Sahaja Yogis in every way that is possible,

17:21.330 --> 17:27.695
in every way you should be dedicated, in every way try to be something

17:27.695 --> 17:29.665
of very great qualities.

17:29.665 --> 17:34.226
Now you have seen how people have becoming violent and there is a violence on.

17:34.226 --> 17:39.665
Of course, this may not continue but it’s one of the signs that we have to be prepared

17:39.665 --> 17:45.598
to be very strong people, very strong,

17:45.598 --> 17:47.368
and that will work out I’m sure.

17:47.368 --> 17:53.266
They threw about 400 stones at least, maybe more according to the police report

17:53.266 --> 17:55.873
and very few people were hurt.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.176
What does that mean?

17:58.176 --> 18:03.345
That there is somebody who is avoiding all these troubles.

18:07.337 --> 18:12.115
Regarding our tour further, now I have decided we will not go to Atith

18:12.115 --> 18:16.738
because there are- the commissioner, the ESP told Me that it is better not to go,

18:16.738 --> 18:20.154
it's very- these people are very bad and they are criminals.

18:20.154 --> 18:24.044
So, now until the election comes in, they will be behaving like this manner.

18:24.334 --> 18:27.479
After the election of course they will be put down.

18:27.479 --> 18:33.985
So you should go by the understanding of the time and

18:33.985 --> 18:38.915
directly to Sangli, so we’ll go to Sangli, we will have a puja there, you can do shopping whatever you like

18:38.915 --> 18:45.115
and then from there will be going to Ganapatipule.

18:45.115 --> 18:49.501
But it’s not fun, it’s not fun.

18:49.501 --> 18:53.776
It is our development.

18:53.776 --> 18:58.891
Otherwise you will be coming to India, going back the same, empty handed.

18:59.396 --> 19:05.214
I want you, everyone, to be extremely active in your own sphere of life,

19:05.214 --> 19:06.204
talk about Sahaja Yoga.

19:06.204 --> 19:11.713
You must wear my badges, you must wear my rings, you must wear my necklaces

19:11.713 --> 19:18.085
so that people ask you “Who is this?” Then you should say, “She is the Holy Ghost”.

19:18.085 --> 19:21.440
You can say, "We think she is the Holy Ghost".

19:21.440 --> 19:23.746
Let us see what happens.

19:27.346 --> 19:31.863
So, it’s a serious thing that I felt that I have to talk to you

19:31.863 --> 19:38.266
and that we have to be very, very careful about how we look at ourselves.

19:38.266 --> 19:42.565
We have to be aware, we have to be aware about ourselves and what is happening.

19:42.565 --> 19:46.409
I’ve been telling you this many a times, we have to be aware as to what we are

19:46.409 --> 19:47.544
and what is happening.

19:47.544 --> 19:53.963
But if your jobs are important, everything else is important how are you going to work out Sahaja Yoga?

19:56.009 --> 19:59.978
So, there has to be awareness and with your awareness the light will spread.

19:59.978 --> 20:03.348
But it’s not silent, you have to talk about it.

20:05.407 --> 20:11.122
Eloquence is needed, it has to be eloquent, all your light has to talk,

20:11.122 --> 20:17.592
the light has to say, the light has to express and has to
be very confidently done.

20:18.136 --> 20:25.521
Let us see now after going from this tour how far people establish new things.

20:25.811 --> 20:32.166
So far, what my own opinion is,  that there are 50% of Sahaja Yogis

20:32.166 --> 20:35.877
in the West are still quite mediocre

20:35.877 --> 20:40.000
and 25% of them are just there to take advantage.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.437
If they can get something free, they would like to do it.

20:43.776 --> 20:45.848
25% people are like that.

20:45.848 --> 20:49.230
It’s very sad but it is so.

20:49.230 --> 20:54.503
But I must say Indians are poor people but
they will not do anything,

20:54.503 --> 20:58.256
they will never take anything free from Me, nothing.

20:58.266 --> 21:01.131
They will not, they are very self-respecting.

21:01.131 --> 21:03.562
And that is what we have to develop, that self-respect.

21:04.386 --> 21:09.097
Like I have seen I had a house in Hounslow, everybody went there and stayed there free.

21:09.097 --> 21:12.670
Now we have a house there in Shuddy Camp where
everybody goes,

21:12.670 --> 21:16.665
who has no job goes and stays there. It’s such a nonsensical thing.

21:16.665 --> 21:21.812
So, I’m even afraid to start any ashram in London because same thing will start.

21:21.812 --> 21:24.968
If they can take advantage they would like to be there.

21:24.968 --> 21:27.679
Even a spoon they would like to carry like that.

21:27.914 --> 21:31.433
It’s a shameless thing for a Sahaja Yogi to behave like that I think.

21:31.583 --> 21:40.393
We have to have full self-respect and we must understand that we have to sacrifice, to do something about it.

21:42.648 --> 21:46.531
Because this is the last leg, I would say, when I will be talking to you about all these things

21:46.531 --> 21:55.502
and in the beautiful atmosphere here on the bank of Krishna river.

21:56.269 --> 22:02.921
We have to understand that the river flows, it makes a sound,

22:02.921 --> 22:07.026
it makes a sound to show that she- it exists.

22:07.944 --> 22:15.264
But we are not only rivers, we are all the mountains, rivers, everything of the universe we are.

22:15.555 --> 22:23.636
And our manifestation is like a big zero as if the Mother Earth has been emptied out.

22:24.646 --> 22:31.809
It is time that we should watch ourselves and see ourselves, what’s wrong with us.

22:31.809 --> 22:33.212
Very important.

22:33.212 --> 22:39.420
I had to say this once again and again,

22:39.420 --> 22:43.258
but I don’t like to say these things because I love you so much

22:43.258 --> 22:47.139
and I care for you so much and you people also love Me.

22:47.139 --> 22:51.239
But loving Me is not sufficient, you have to love yourself and respect yourself.

22:51.521 --> 22:53.920
Only your Self is going to work out.

22:54.155 --> 22:57.754
As Shivaji Maharaj said, "Swa-dharma rajya"

22:57.754 --> 23:03.009
"You must develop the religion of your Spirit".

23:03.300 --> 23:08.202
That’s what we have to do, is to develop the religion of our Spirit.

23:08.202 --> 23:17.577
And once it happens, we can get the whole world completely emancipated.

23:17.577 --> 23:24.279
This is our work and if we fail then it is the responsibility of Sahaja Yogis and nobody else

23:24.279 --> 23:31.209
So, for everyone I have to tell you that I don’t have to please you, you have to please me.

23:34.176 --> 23:40.176
For a small thing people react, for a small thing they feel bad.

23:40.176 --> 23:43.985
If I don’t smile at somebody they feel bad.

23:43.985 --> 23:47.672
In little, little things they feel bad and they react.

23:47.672 --> 23:50.148
If I say anything, they react.

23:50.148 --> 23:52.378
So how can anything go into you?

23:52.501 --> 23:56.721
If it is such a convexity, how will you absorb it?

23:56.721 --> 24:03.249
It is important that we should try to absorb
with humility, with understanding.

24:03.249 --> 24:06.563
Now you are Sahaja Yogis, you know I am Adi Shakti,

24:06.563 --> 24:09.488
you have had photographs, you have known that I am Adi Shakti.

24:09.488 --> 24:11.636
But how much are we absorbing?

24:11.636 --> 24:13.634
How much we are taking within ourselves?

24:13.634 --> 24:18.386
This work is much more than any one of the incarnations had to do.

24:18.386 --> 24:23.253
It's much more than Christ, is much more than Rama, much more than Shri Krishna’s.

24:23.684 --> 24:27.669
So create such great people among you.

24:27.669 --> 24:33.693
Because I have the power, only thing, you have to have the absorption power,

24:33.693 --> 24:35.369
the acceptability.

24:35.369 --> 24:41.200
But if you run after something very cheapish and something very frivolous, it’s impossible.

24:42.023 --> 24:50.730
You have to ask for your depth and you have to take in, whatever is emitting from my being.

24:50.730 --> 24:54.165
I hope now you all will take it up seriously.

24:54.165 --> 24:57.455
Do your meditation every morning whatever maybe the time.

24:57.455 --> 25:04.016
Every morning we have to do the meditation and we have to see that we finish our work in the night

25:04.016 --> 25:07.364
and then we do little meditation and then sleep off.

25:07.364 --> 25:14.117
Without meditation you cannot grow and that’s why everything doing you have to know that you have to get up in the morning,

25:14.117 --> 25:18.077
do your meditation and then you can take to your work.

25:18.077 --> 25:20.796
Daytime if you want, you can rest for a while.

25:20.796 --> 25:24.904
Now we are in such a place that we have time to rest for a while,

25:24.904 --> 25:28.031
but morning time you have to get up whatever time you sleep.

25:28.031 --> 25:32.398
You have to conquer your sleep a little bit, it gives you lot of lethargy.

25:32.398 --> 25:37.348
Last night I don’t think I slept before 3 o’clock or something like that

25:37.348 --> 25:41.327
and then the whole day I’ve been busy writing reports, this, that.

25:41.500 --> 25:47.080
If I can manage at this age, at your age you should be able to manage something like that.

25:47.231 --> 25:52.282
We have no time to sleep, we have no time to discuss, argue or to eat our food.

25:52.544 --> 25:57.418
We have only time to meditate, that’s all.

25:57.934 --> 26:04.454
I wish all of you absorb my saying and understand it without reacting to it.

26:04.454 --> 26:05.837
Please do not react.

26:05.837 --> 26:08.665
Don’t think, "Mother is trying to chastise you". No.

26:08.665 --> 26:13.926
I’m trying to help you to grow, this is the way you grow sometimes very fast.

26:13.926 --> 26:17.610
So it’s just your growth I am worried about and nothing else.

26:17.610 --> 26:19.029
May God bless you all.

26:19.029 --> 26:25.609
I was very happy the way you were singing all the songs and the way you expressed yourselves.
