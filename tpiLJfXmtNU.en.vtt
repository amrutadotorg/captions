Shakti Puja, Togliatti (Russia), 3 August 1993.

00:15:08.804 --> 00:15:14.917
Today it is such a great day for our Being,

00:15:15.117 --> 00:15:21.332
to be with you all again this year.

00:15:30.877 --> 00:15:42.888
It’s so very joyous and full of fragrance.

00:15:52.454 --> 00:16:00.040
Today we have decided to have a Puja of Shakti that is the power,

00:16:00.240 --> 00:16:04.388
that is the Devi.

00:16:20.212 --> 00:16:26.762
You know within us there are many powers

00:16:26.962 --> 00:16:34.876
of Maha Kali, Maha Saraswati, Maha Lakshmi, Kundalini.

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:53.410
All these powers are there for us to ascent.

00:17:22.302 --> 00:17:31.699
If these powers are properly used and understood,

00:17:31.899 --> 00:17:38.759
then your ascent can be permanent.

00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.875
Once you achieve your ascent

00:17:51.075 --> 00:17:54.648
and enter into the kingdom of God,

00:17:54.848 --> 00:17:59.481
all these powers get enlightened.

00:18:06.197 --> 00:18:14.919
And these powers which are enlightened

00:18:15.119 --> 00:18:23.283
are absolutely filled with Love.

00:18:33.369 --> 00:18:37.909
Enlightenment, we have to understand that

00:18:38.109 --> 00:18:43.273
we get completely enlightened by Love.

00:18:50.593 --> 00:18:54.572
So after enlightenment, after realisation,

00:18:54.772 --> 00:19:00.866
we use only one power which is of Love.

00:19:09.325 --> 00:19:16.059
Shri Rama had two sons: one was Lav and one was Kush.

00:19:20.278 --> 00:19:25.929
One of them, Lav, came to Russia.

00:19:28.038 --> 00:19:33.452
That’s why you are called as Slavs, means ‘with love’.

00:19:37.828 --> 00:19:49.428
So Russian people are already quite full of their heart with love.

00:19:54.832 --> 00:20:00.445
But once you get your enlightenment

00:20:00.645 --> 00:20:05.617
you realise that your love becomes

00:20:05.817 --> 00:20:12.746
a beautiful ocean of joy for yourself.

00:20:22.982 --> 00:20:30.587
This love is not the same which you had before enlightenment.

00:20:34.433 --> 00:20:45.573
It’s transformed into a new dimension, into a new form.

00:20:47.894 --> 00:20:52.827
Before enlightenment you are attached to yourself,

00:20:53.027 --> 00:20:56.952
first of all, very much: to your body, to your mind,

00:20:57.152 --> 00:21:03.264
to your conditionings, to your intellect, to your ego.

00:21:12.808 --> 00:21:15.944
And that is how you develop

00:21:16.144 --> 00:21:24.165
darkness of many horrible things within yourself.

00:21:29.344 --> 00:21:31.700
If you are too much attached to your body,

00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:34.947
then you may eat too much or you may not eat at all

00:21:35.147 --> 00:21:38.086
or you may exercise too much

00:21:38.287 --> 00:21:46.100
or you may work it out for a particular form of your figure.

00:21:57.183 --> 00:22:01.819
And you will use your body for absolutely wrong things

00:22:02.019 --> 00:22:06.222
or sinful things also.

00:22:10.825 --> 00:22:14.219
But then you become enlightened

00:22:14.419 --> 00:22:20.488
and you understand that your body is the temple of God.

00:22:26.230 --> 00:22:33.629
Then you keep your body clean and also you try to avoid

00:22:33.829 --> 00:22:39.079
all that is destructive for your body.

00:22:47.442 --> 00:22:52.201
The another attachment we have is very limited,

00:22:52.402 --> 00:22:56.702
say for your own family, for your children, for your wife,

00:22:56.902 --> 00:23:01.548
for your husband, something like that.

00:23:09.923 --> 00:23:14.688
Despite that a human being can be extremely selfish

00:23:14.889 --> 00:23:17.481
and could only bother about himself

00:23:17.681 --> 00:23:22.946
and first of all him and then the rest.

00:23:32.181 --> 00:23:36.750
Also he may spoil his children or spoil her husband

00:23:36.950 --> 00:23:46.101
or his wife in any way just to pamper their ego.

00:23:58.044 --> 00:24:03.078
Some people might indulge into alcoholism

00:24:03.278 --> 00:24:07.527
or drugs or all kinds of things.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:20.628
Also to help their families they may draw other people,

00:24:27.579 --> 00:24:33.899
because they are very self-centered and their vision is very narrow.

00:24:37.975 --> 00:24:42.617
Sometimes they discover that for those people for whom

00:24:42.818 --> 00:24:50.005
they are doing wrong things, are not actually bother about them.

00:24:58.527 --> 00:25:03.405
Then there’s enlightenment and they see for themselves

00:25:03.605 --> 00:25:06.639
that whatever I’m doing is neither good for me

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:11.387
nor for my family, nor my relations.

00:25:21.314 --> 00:25:26.361
After enlightenment you think collectively.

00:25:29.032 --> 00:25:32.996
Also when you think about your wife and your children,

00:25:33.196 --> 00:25:38.876
your family, you think what is the right thing for them to do.

00:25:47.644 --> 00:25:52.078
Immediately you become attentive to their problems

00:25:52.278 --> 00:25:56.364
and to their destructiveness.

00:26:05.013 --> 00:26:10.989
Then this power of love changes the whole atmosphere.

00:26:13.884 --> 00:26:18.840
In the family people see how sacrificing you are

00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:23.164
and how noble you are.

00:26:30.664 --> 00:26:37.271
This nobility is seen very clearly among Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:42.021 --> 00:26:46.893
In that noble understanding of life

00:26:47.093 --> 00:26:55.856
they try to be extremely patient, sweet in the family

00:26:56.056 --> 00:27:01.407
and try to bring them to the right path.

00:27:11.512 --> 00:27:18.545
At the same time when they are helping their families

00:27:18.746 --> 00:27:24.546
and try to improve their understanding,

00:27:24.747 --> 00:27:30.891
they can be also very particular as to see that

00:27:31.115 --> 00:27:40.842
they do not allow over indulgence into their family.

00:27:50.242 --> 00:27:54.578
Because of the enlightenment, there’s detachment.

00:27:59.047 --> 00:28:03.951
And the power of detached love is the greatest.

00:28:06.717 --> 00:28:11.389
It’s like the sap in the trees which rises from the Mother Earth,

00:28:11.589 --> 00:28:16.616
goes up into the smallest of leaves

00:28:16.816 --> 00:28:23.459
and then it is either evaporated or goes back to the Mother Earth.

00:28:34.180 --> 00:28:37.371
It doesn’t stay in one flower

00:28:37.571 --> 00:28:44.957
because it likes it or in one leaf because it likes it.

00:28:51.645 --> 00:28:55.773
It nourishes every part of the tree, whatever is need,

00:28:55.973 --> 00:29:00.294
and is not attached.

00:29:05.156 --> 00:29:12.183
But supposing it gets entangled or involved in one flower

00:29:12.383 --> 00:29:15.871
or in one leaf, the tree will die

00:29:16.071 --> 00:29:20.899
and that leaf and that flower will also die.

00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:36.688
So detached love only gives, doesn’t expect anything back.

00:29:41.344 --> 00:29:46.571
If it expects anything is complete prosperity

00:29:46.771 --> 00:29:54.060
and the goodness of the tree.

00:29:59.005 --> 00:30:03.672
In the same way a saintly person, who is a Sahaja Yogi,

00:30:03.872 --> 00:30:07.571
behaves towards his family, towards his friends,

00:30:07.771 --> 00:30:11.801
towards everything.

00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:24.319
We have used only the power of hatred so far.

00:30:27.428 --> 00:30:30.845
In the politics, especially, one country believes that

00:30:31.045 --> 00:30:36.100
they must hate another country, they are born for that.

00:30:41.793 --> 00:30:44.020
Because hundred years back

00:30:44.221 --> 00:30:47.859
some quarrel took place or a war took place,

00:30:48.059 --> 00:30:52.780
so the children are still fighting among themselves.

00:30:58.936 --> 00:31:02.823
You’ll be amazed that when I first came to Russia,

00:31:03.023 --> 00:31:10.038
25 German Sahaja Yogis rushed to help Me here.

00:31:18.476 --> 00:31:22.092
Instead of bearing that malice in their hearts,

00:31:22.292 --> 00:31:25.842
as their forefathers had killed so many of Russians,

00:31:26.042 --> 00:31:31.800
they felt it was their greatest wishes to go

00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:36.972
and do some service for the Russians.

00:31:49.050 --> 00:31:55.614
So all the hatred changes into this powerful Love.

00:32:01.177 --> 00:32:07.230
This power of Love is the greatest power and after Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:07.430 --> 00:32:12.609
we have to use only our power of Love.

00:32:18.029 --> 00:32:26.108
It’s the most powerful, effective weapon that we have.

00:32:30.022 --> 00:32:34.303
Because this is Divine Love.

00:32:36.657 --> 00:32:39.035
We are getting the source of Divine Love

00:32:39.235 --> 00:32:44.688
from the all pervading power of God’s Love.

00:32:50.093 --> 00:32:54.101
They say that God is Almighty.

00:32:56.556 --> 00:33:01.173
Then who can be more powerful than God?

00:33:03.790 --> 00:33:07.064
And if we are connected with God Almighty,

00:33:07.264 --> 00:33:11.491
who could be mightier than us?

00:33:16.061 --> 00:33:22.698
In His Love He protects us, He gives us whatever we want,

00:33:22.898 --> 00:33:28.939
He blesses us and He makes us enjoy ourselves.

00:33:36.673 --> 00:33:43.938
His government is the most efficient
one and is very quick and very fast.

00:33:47.584 --> 00:33:52.126
Today only when I was coming, one
of the Sahaja Yogis came and said,

00:33:52.326 --> 00:33:57.037
“Mother it is very cloudy, it may rain.”

00:34:03.399 --> 00:34:05.999
And when I came out after five minutes

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:10.312
I found the whole sky is cleared out.

00:34:14.039 --> 00:34:22.563
So all these five elements also are at
the disposal of the children of God.

00:34:27.008 --> 00:34:30.724
Even the cruellest of the cruel person melts down

00:34:30.924 --> 00:34:40.086
and comes to the humble understanding of this power.

00:34:45.852 --> 00:34:50.002
No one can harm you.

00:34:50.799 --> 00:34:56.291
And anybody who tries to harm you becomes melted away.

00:35:00.948 --> 00:35:04.425
It is so many miracles that in this short speech

00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:06.919
I won’t be able to tell you all of them.

00:35:07.119 --> 00:35:12.286
But you’ll find it in your life itself, how this power of Love,

00:35:12.486 --> 00:35:18.030
that you have within your heart, has protected you.

00:35:27.192 --> 00:35:29.835
I have seen people who are very hot tempered,

00:35:30.035 --> 00:35:35.105
who are angry type, who are all the
time making other’s life miserable,

00:35:35.306 --> 00:35:40.523
become extremely beautiful, nice people.

00:35:51.111 --> 00:35:56.591
With this Light of Love, you love yourself in the right way

00:35:56.791 --> 00:36:02.952
and give up all that is wrong, all that is immoral.

00:36:11.441 --> 00:36:16.209
This Love is eternal, is very powerful

00:36:16.409 --> 00:36:24.033
and gives you a confidence in the collectivity of human beings.

00:36:28.852 --> 00:36:37.000
Because it’s the Spirit which enlightens all your power.

00:36:40.402 --> 00:36:48.082
And the Spirit is the source of collectivity and love

00:36:48.282 --> 00:36:52.376
for every human being in the world.

00:36:57.426 --> 00:37:01.289
Then your attention goes to all the people who are in trouble,

00:37:01.489 --> 00:37:07.140
who are suffering, who need help.

00:37:12.892 --> 00:37:16.020
And with this attention, which is so enlightened,

00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:21.487
you can solve their problems sitting down here.

00:37:27.687 --> 00:37:33.049
With such people there’s no need to have any wars,

00:37:33.249 --> 00:37:39.883
no need to have any weapons, no need to have any boundaries.

00:37:46.687 --> 00:37:51.906
If Russians go to India, they feel India as their country,

00:37:52.107 --> 00:37:58.035
if Indians come to Russia they think Russia their own country.

00:38:05.321 --> 00:38:09.338
So who will fight?

00:38:09.538 --> 00:38:13.940
There’s no one to whom you can really say: “He is my enemy” ,

00:38:14.140 --> 00:38:19.739
because everybody is part and parcel of your being.

00:38:28.883 --> 00:38:34.788
These are the special times, I call them the Blossom time

00:38:34.988 --> 00:38:41.426
when too many flowers are there who are seeking the Truth.

00:38:51.671 --> 00:38:57.141
And their fragrance is their Love.

00:39:00.501 --> 00:39:04.723
And they have all to become fruits now.

00:39:06.833 --> 00:39:09.811
And this is what is going to happen

00:39:10.012 --> 00:39:14.867
as these times are very, very important.

00:39:19.570 --> 00:39:23.945
In all the religions they are described.

00:39:25.986 --> 00:39:30.208
We don’t hate anyone because we believe in one religion

00:39:30.408 --> 00:39:37.255
or another religion. On the contrary,
we believe in all the religions.

00:39:46.071 --> 00:39:49.910
This is the power by which a drop becomes the ocean

00:39:50.110 --> 00:39:54.384
and individual becomes the collective.

00:40:01.278 --> 00:40:04.778
So all your powers that are there are enlightened

00:40:04.978 --> 00:40:09.111
by the all pervading power.

00:40:14.244 --> 00:40:22.468
It transforms you and it has such a beautiful, delicate way

00:40:22.668 --> 00:40:26.926
of handling everything.

00:40:34.269 --> 00:40:40.713
The only thing that is needed is faith in this power,

00:40:43.753 --> 00:40:48.436
that only by having Love for others,

00:40:48.636 --> 00:40:52.592
and this enlightened Love

00:40:52.792 --> 00:40:58.533
is going to give you whatever you want.

00:41:06.356 --> 00:41:11.262
And there is such a power, All-pervading power.

00:41:17.635 --> 00:41:21.850
There is no doubt about it.

00:41:22.050 --> 00:41:26.305
And we have to just accept it with our open heart

00:41:26.505 --> 00:41:32.169
that it fills it and makes us a great personality.

00:41:38.431 --> 00:41:42.286
So there’s no competition, there’s no ambition,

00:41:42.486 --> 00:41:48.426
there’s no jealousy, nothing of the kind.

00:41:54.367 --> 00:41:59.495
The only desire then left is that "I am enjoying myself,

00:41:59.695 --> 00:42:03.726
let others also enjoy."

00:42:10.305 --> 00:42:15.859
People go out of the way to spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:19.398 --> 00:42:25.419
They work very hard, travel with very little money,

00:42:25.619 --> 00:42:28.794
they try to convince people,

00:42:28.994 --> 00:42:34.786
do all kinds of things for no material gain.

00:42:42.684 --> 00:42:45.723
But the greatest joy is when you see that

00:42:45.923 --> 00:42:49.098
you have raised the Kundalini of another person

00:42:49.298 --> 00:42:53.978
and given him self-realisation.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:06.039
That lits up your faces I have seen many times.

00:43:11.643 --> 00:43:17.081
Let this Love grow more and more.

00:43:20.329 --> 00:43:25.743
They asked me, why of all places I came to Togliatti.

00:43:29.313 --> 00:43:37.695
Not for Volga, not for these beautiful houses you have

00:43:37.895 --> 00:43:42.476
but for My children who are here.

00:43:49.241 --> 00:43:53.637
May God bless you.
