1
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:45,880
You see, here we are in the seminar and we
are all Sahaja Yogis and we are having a good

2
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:51,440
time, we are cracking jokes, we’re discussing
things, etc., etc.

3
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,490
But, this is all very well, I mean, one can
enjoy oneself, in fact one should enjoy oneself

4
00:00:57,490 --> 00:01:02,170
because the whole creation has been created
in such a way that we should enjoy ourselves.

5
00:01:02,170 --> 00:01:08,810
From the dawn of the creation, the Shri Adi
Shakti of the Universe has played out a drama

6
00:01:08,810 --> 00:01:14,680
using Her Deities, using all the powers that
She created, to create a Universe so beautiful

7
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:20,330
that it should be possible for us to live
in it in complete joy and complete enjoyment

8
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,330
of our existence.

9
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,840
If one gives you an example…

10
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,890
Yesterday we sat and we listened to ragas.

11
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:33,241
These ragas themselves were inspired by the
Shri Adi Shakti in realized souls those who

12
00:01:33,241 --> 00:01:35,350
gave them to the world.

13
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,409
The whole thing has been created by Her in
different aspects.

14
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:46,710
So that we should enjoy ourselves and so that
we should not be miserable.

15
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,380
And why does She want us to be happy?

16
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:53,650
Because it is when you are happy and relaxed
than the power of God can work on you, to

17
00:01:53,650 --> 00:01:59,549
raise you to a great height for which you
are destined.

18
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:06,780
You see, this whole drama that has taken place
is not a drama without purpose.

19
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,620
Within it lies something that is profoundly
important and that something which is profoundly

20
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,900
important is the awareness of God the Absolute
the Almighty.

21
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:21,909
And this is the whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga.

22
00:02:21,909 --> 00:02:27,469
All the different techniques we use are a
bridge to this.

23
00:02:27,469 --> 00:02:32,310
You see, you have to understand what is Shri
Mataji on this Earth.

24
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,529
She is the Adi Shakti.

25
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:37,269
Now, how many people know what is the Adi
Shakti?

26
00:02:37,269 --> 00:02:41,079
The Adi Shakti is the power of God Almighty
Himself.

27
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:46,930
It is the highest manifest thing in the Universe.

28
00:02:46,930 --> 00:02:52,299
When this thing takes Avatara in the Universe
for the first time, there must be a profound

29
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,000
significance behind this.

30
00:02:55,000 --> 00:03:02,760
And this profound significance must be the
awareness of the Lord the Almighty.

31
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:08,329
In your body are placed the various chakras
of the tantra.

32
00:03:08,329 --> 00:03:09,669
The instrument.

33
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:11,689
Tantra means instrument.

34
00:03:11,689 --> 00:03:14,290
What are this chakras for?

35
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:19,230
And people spend a lot of time cleaning them,
taking them out, putting them in salt water,

36
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,829
putting them back again.

37
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:23,329
But for what purpose?

38
00:03:23,329 --> 00:03:25,010
You see, you have to think for what purpose.

39
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,819
Try to think why you are here instead of doing
things routinely.

40
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:35,219
The chakras raise the awareness of the human
individual from step to step, higher and higher

41
00:03:35,219 --> 00:03:38,079
until it can reach the throne of the Almighty
Himself.

42
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:40,189
That is their purpose.

43
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:45,199
So, those who do not use it for that are like
a man who has a Rolls Royce who takes it apart,

44
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:50,730
puts it in oil, puts it together again, starts
the engine and goes nowhere.

45
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:57,280
You see, the whole tantras have been given
to you to raise your attention to the Absolutely

46
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,730
the Almighty.

47
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,129
The whole of Sahaja Yoga has been given to
you to raise your attention to the Absolute

48
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,620
the Almighty.

49
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:05,719
Your friends are given to you for this purpose.

50
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:10,419
And the Shri Adi Shakti Herself has appeared
before you to give you this.

51
00:04:10,419 --> 00:04:17,199
Now, there is no doubt that Shri Adi Shakti
is Mahamaya.

52
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,510
What does Mahamaya mean?

53
00:04:18,510 --> 00:04:21,440
And why is She Mahamaya?

54
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,360
You see, you should question these basic fundamentals.

55
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:28,590
After all, God is the Prime Architect of the
Universe.

56
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:30,910
There is nothing that He does that is purposeless.

57
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:33,550
You have to understand this.

58
00:04:33,550 --> 00:04:40,030
If we have purpose in what we do in our limitations
how much greater is His purpose?

59
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:49,160
You see, if a long time ago, more than 1,400
years ago, Shri Adi Shankaracharya told human

60
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:55,570
beings, “You are the Absolute, there is
no difference between you and God the Almighty,

61
00:04:55,570 --> 00:04:56,570
Adwaita."

62
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:03,270
Now, if you are the Absolute, the Atma unless
you are diluted, there can be no creation,

63
00:05:03,270 --> 00:05:04,270
isn’t it?

64
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:09,950
Because if you are always aware that you’re
the Atma Tattwa, how can you be involved in

65
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:10,950
creation?

66
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,750
You’ll always be lost in meditation on your
own existence.

67
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:17,500
You have to understand this basic fact.

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:23,070
So, the Mahamaya was necessary for the creation.

69
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:26,820
She was necessary for the evolution of the
creation.

70
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:31,090
Because by playing out dramas for you she
evolves you.

71
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:34,730
And it’s only when you reach a certain level
that She can liberate you from herself.

72
00:05:34,730 --> 00:05:39,730
So, that you see beyond the Maya, the Absolute.

73
00:05:39,730 --> 00:05:45,680
Now, there is a saying in one of the Puranas
that, “The Devi can only be worshiped by

74
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,540
those who are both, intelligent and brave."

75
00:05:48,540 --> 00:05:51,940
And She cannot be worshiped by the stupid
and the cowardly.

76
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:56,970
This is very important, you see, we have been
given brains.

77
00:05:56,970 --> 00:06:00,500
We haven’t been given brains to sort out
trivialities of life.

78
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,900
We have been given brains to chart our course
to the Almighty the Absolute.

79
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:08,730
She is not going to spoon-feed you.

80
00:06:08,730 --> 00:06:13,140
Beyond a certain point you have to find the
course for yourself.

81
00:06:13,140 --> 00:06:17,820
The reason for this is that unless you do
so you are not worthy to be presented before

82
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:18,820
the Almighty.

83
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:23,070
Only those who are using their courage and
their intelligence, the strength of their

84
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:28,700
desire can find the course, are worthy really
to come before Him.

85
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:36,500
This is all part of the evolution of mankind.

86
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:40,910
To understand and appreciate the Almighty
you have to have an awareness that is capable

87
00:06:40,910 --> 00:06:44,390
of receiving it.

88
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:49,260
About two years ago Shri Mataji came to Riyadh
and I’ve written a Sanskrit poem which I

89
00:06:49,260 --> 00:06:50,430
presented to Her.

90
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:54,340
And She began to complete it for me because
it was incomplete.

91
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:59,580
And one of the verses was, “…how can I
pour all this into such small cups?

92
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:00,580
..."

93
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:04,600
You see, because the awareness, the brain
is not yet developed to the point it can take

94
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,940
the radiation, the full weight of radiation
of the Almighty into it.

95
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:11,710
So, how are you going to develop the brain?

96
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:15,330
After all, the brain is the Agnya chakra.

97
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:23,420
You develop the brain by focusing it on the
nature of the Almighty the Absolute.

98
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:26,500
Contemplating it every day of one’s existence.

99
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,900
In this way the attention goes up to it.

100
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,490
And the nerves in the brain get refined.

101
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:37,980
The petals of the Sahastrara get refined to
the point that they can receive the grace

102
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:42,350
of the Absolute and His awareness.

103
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:44,310
The Shri Adi Shakti is His Shakti.

104
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:47,530
She is the power by which all things are done.

105
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:50,639
She is the one who refine your brain for you.

106
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:53,940
But you yourself have to put your attention
there.

107
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,210
It is very easy in Sahaja Yoga because one
is left alone a lot to put one’s attention

108
00:08:01,210 --> 00:08:04,540
on trivialities.

109
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:08,650
A chakra may catch.

110
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:10,100
But what does it matter?

111
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:14,600
The catch may release within five or ten minutes.

112
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:18,330
So, why bother about it?

113
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:21,230
That we know that the catches move from chakra
to chakra.

114
00:08:21,230 --> 00:08:27,720
That the movement of the kundalini moves from
chakra to chakra.

115
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:54,220
So, what is the purpose of concentrating on
things that are trivial?

116
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:59,149
In the past, you see, many great seekers came
on this Earth to seek God.

117
00:08:59,149 --> 00:09:00,300
After what are you seeking?

118
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:01,550
What does seeking mean?

119
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:03,110
It means to seek God.

120
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,120
They had no Shri Adi Shakti to help them.

121
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,600
You have it here in front of you.

122
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,579
So, you should take advantage of it.

123
00:09:14,579 --> 00:09:22,990
And try and become fixed at that point which
is the Absolute.

124
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:29,830
And you may all be here in a collective but
the relationship between you and the Absolute

125
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,430
has to be individual between you and Him alone.

126
00:09:33,430 --> 00:09:36,829
And when you see Him, you don’t see anyone
else.

127
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:37,959
You see.

128
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:43,670
It is very good to be in the collective, it
is very good to be with each other to enjoy

129
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:53,339
each other’s company but your relationship
with each other should be such that it fosters

130
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:56,740
that ascent to the Divine the Absolute.

131
00:09:56,740 --> 00:09:58,519
We have to be very clear.

132
00:09:58,519 --> 00:10:02,480
The whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga is this ascent.

133
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:08,060
The great Goddess Herself the Shri Adi Shakti
has a devotion to our Lord which is indescribable

134
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:10,860
in human terms.

135
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:15,559
The whole play between the Almighty and the
Shakti is something which is one of the profoundest

136
00:10:15,559 --> 00:10:21,029
mysteries of mankind and of the Creation.

137
00:10:21,029 --> 00:10:26,339
And the deepest desire of the Shri Adi Shakti
is the ascent of Her creation and Her children

138
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,509
to the throne of the Almighty as an offering
to Her Lord.

139
00:10:30,509 --> 00:10:36,519
Just as we, when we present an offering to
Shri Mataji if there are flowers, we take

140
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:39,850
out the worst flowers, we present only the
best, the most perfect.

141
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:45,300
So, when the Shri Adi Shakti offers to Her
Lord Her Creation it is something at a level

142
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,360
far removed from this.

143
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:52,570
And only the most perfect that can be presented
before Him.

144
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,570
You see.

145
00:10:53,570 --> 00:10:55,880
You have to understand this.

146
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,821
As human beings we have no importance.

147
00:10:57,821 --> 00:11:05,879
Except, in so far as we play a part in this
play between the Lord and His Shakti.

148
00:11:05,879 --> 00:11:12,690
The entire creation can be discarded, if it
does not serve this purpose.

149
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:18,209
Cause there are only two things which are
real in the Universe and that is the Lord

150
00:11:18,209 --> 00:11:19,209
and His Shakti.

151
00:11:19,209 --> 00:11:24,410
All else is superfluous to this and of no
importance.

152
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:28,880
At the end of creation only those two things
will remain.

153
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:35,639
So, you must not take lightly what is happening.

154
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:39,029
You are the essential parts and pieces of
this drama.

155
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:46,170
This very profound drama which is the basis
and the internal root of the Universe.

156
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:51,180
Have you ever considered why the Mooladhara
chakra has four petals?

157
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:53,569
What does it mean?

158
00:11:53,569 --> 00:11:54,760
Why four?

159
00:11:54,760 --> 00:12:00,850
It is four because if you combine the Lord
and the Shakti in the Sushumna where Their

160
00:12:00,850 --> 00:12:03,560
feet rest you will find four feet resting.

161
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:09,230
It is the… that is why it is the ultimate
purity because it represents the combined

162
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:15,059
feet of the Lord and his Shakti and that is
given as a throne to the son, Ganesha, the

163
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:18,629
Lord, the Omkara to sit on.

164
00:12:18,629 --> 00:12:23,380
These things are very important, very profound.

165
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:30,759
To be the seat of the play of the Lord and
Shakti one needs extreme purity, extreme wisdom

166
00:12:30,759 --> 00:12:33,850
and extreme awareness of what is happening.

167
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:38,290
The whole purpose of this creation is that
and that alone.

168
00:12:38,290 --> 00:12:41,980
The creation was not made for you to iron
saris.

169
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,029
To worry about your dhobi [laundryman].

170
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:48,329
These are totally irrelevant.

171
00:12:48,329 --> 00:12:57,999
They won’t even last a century, leave alone
eternity.

172
00:12:57,999 --> 00:12:59,470
Nor is organization there.

173
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:02,809
You can organize till you’re blue in the
face but unless the desire of the Absolute

174
00:13:02,809 --> 00:13:06,600
works you will not get another Sahaja Yogi.

175
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,600
You have seen this.

176
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,600
Many of you have.

177
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:13,519
We had many wonderful experiences in the early
days when we turned up at empty halls in spite

178
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,790
of massive publicity.

179
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:18,329
You see, you do not do anything.

180
00:13:18,329 --> 00:13:21,879
Lord Krishna when He came He said, “You
do not do anything.

181
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:23,399
I do it all."

182
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,470
So, the human being who deludes himself into
thinking he is doing.

183
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:27,470
He is not doing.

184
00:13:27,470 --> 00:13:28,620
He said, “Act!

185
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:30,620
You have to act.

186
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,309
But leave the results of your actions to Me."

187
00:13:34,309 --> 00:13:41,269
So, act without expectation is what He is
saying.

188
00:13:41,269 --> 00:13:45,130
Now, how are you going to awaken?

189
00:13:45,130 --> 00:13:48,670
What you are going to do?

190
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,939
You see, when one acts, everyone knows what
the left side is what the right side is.

191
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:57,040
One acts by the right using the power of desire
of the left.

192
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:59,640
This is something that is well known to everybody.

193
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,850
Through which chakra does one act?

194
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:04,190
Which is the chakra of activity?

195
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:07,130
Who will answer it?

196
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,130
Of creation?

197
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:13,560
You must all know this, it’s basic stuff.

198
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
The Swadhisthana.

199
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,560
Ok.

200
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:17,759
The Swadhisthana is on the right, is it not?

201
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:19,129
And the Shuddha Ichha is on the left.

202
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:23,139
So, what is the bridge between the desire
of God the Almighty and action?

203
00:14:23,139 --> 00:14:24,689
It is the left Swadhisthana chakra.

204
00:14:24,689 --> 00:14:25,689
Correct?

205
00:14:25,689 --> 00:14:29,579
And that is why all boots go and sit there.

206
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:31,930
To disconnect your action from your desire.

207
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:33,989
Very simple, you see.

208
00:14:33,989 --> 00:14:42,429
Wherever the boots hit hard you must know
that is an important chakra.

209
00:14:42,429 --> 00:14:49,980
Now, you see, although we are human beings,
we are by the grace of God enlightened souls.

210
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:55,980
This means that the entire tantra of the Universe
is present in miniature within us.

211
00:14:55,980 --> 00:15:00,000
This Shri Mataji has done and She said, “I’ve
placed you there.

212
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,129
Now, what you do with yourself is your affair."

213
00:15:02,129 --> 00:15:10,050
Now, as the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe
… Does everyone know what the Shuddha Ichha

214
00:15:10,050 --> 00:15:11,050
is?

215
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:13,739
The Shuddha Ichha is the pure desire of the
Universe.

216
00:15:13,739 --> 00:15:15,390
Now, what is the pure desire of the Universe?

217
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,629
The pure desire of the Universe is God, the
desire of God Almighty Himself.

218
00:15:19,629 --> 00:15:25,079
As this flows through the Ida nadi of the
Universe and is carried by the Goddess Shri

219
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:30,399
Mahakali to be placed, deposited within the
kundalini.

220
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:37,110
So, this flows within your left side or can
flow within your left side if you desire it.

221
00:15:37,110 --> 00:15:38,529
To inform your activities.

222
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:44,459
Now, you see, unless you are connected your
activities are without meaning.

223
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:48,679
It is like ants scurrying around not knowing
what they are doing.

224
00:15:48,679 --> 00:15:52,490
So, first, one has to establish within oneself
the pure desire.

225
00:15:52,490 --> 00:15:55,589
Let it flow within your Ida nadi.

226
00:15:55,589 --> 00:15:57,199
How would you do that?

227
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,660
It’s very simple.

228
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:02,870
You pray to Shri Mataji and you say, “You
are the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe and

229
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:06,809
I worship You as such."

230
00:16:06,809 --> 00:16:11,360
If you just do that, pray to Her, pray to
Her, is this, She will flow with such force

231
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:16,829
within your Ida nadis that She will break
anything that is in your left Swadhisthana

232
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:18,939
and flow into the right.

233
00:16:18,939 --> 00:16:21,809
To inform your activity.

234
00:16:21,809 --> 00:16:27,629
You cannot catch on the right side if your
left side is strong.

235
00:16:27,629 --> 00:16:28,629
You see.

236
00:16:28,629 --> 00:16:31,420
So, that is the first stage.

237
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:35,639
If you do that the Shuddha Ichha, you don’t
need to do more than this, the Shuddha Ichha

238
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:40,680
will flow through all your chakras, it will
eventually break open the barriers that are

239
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:49,069
in your brain and infuse with enlightenment
and nectar every nerve fiber and cell within

240
00:16:49,069 --> 00:16:50,069
your brain.

241
00:16:50,069 --> 00:16:56,509
As it does that your whole consciousness and
awareness will be altered.

242
00:16:56,509 --> 00:17:02,610
As it is altered your awareness will be filled
with the awareness of the Absolute.

243
00:17:02,610 --> 00:17:07,809
As it is filled with the awareness of the
Absolute you will see Shri Mataji clearly

244
00:17:07,809 --> 00:17:11,530
for what She is which is the Shakti of God
Almighty Himself.

245
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:15,600
We will not say, “Shri Mataji did this,
Shri Mataji did that,” you know, all the

246
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,940
Maya and the play.

247
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:19,660
Some people fill tragic one minute, happy
next…

248
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:21,200
This is all nonsense.

249
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:27,209
If you are based in yourself you will remain
absolutely stable in the sight of your parents,

250
00:17:27,209 --> 00:17:28,970
in the sight of the Almighty.

251
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:32,060
You do not shift from day to day.

252
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:33,070
You don’t doubt yourself.

253
00:17:33,070 --> 00:17:37,390
You cannot become Nirvikalpa until you know
this.

254
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:41,990
Because part of the Nirvikalpa is not just
doubting God or Shri Mataji.

255
00:17:41,990 --> 00:17:43,510
It’s very easy not to do that.

256
00:17:43,510 --> 00:17:47,000
It’s not doubting yourself as an extension
of Them.

257
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,690
Because as Shri Mataji said, She has made
every single one of us into a part of Her

258
00:17:51,690 --> 00:17:52,690
body.

259
00:17:52,690 --> 00:17:57,560
So, to doubt oneself is in a sense to doubt
Her.

260
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:04,330
Now, people try to avoid recognizing what
has been done to them by getting Realization

261
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:06,840
in Sahaja Yoga.

262
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,410
You don’t want to see that they have been
made a part of the body of God Almighty Himself

263
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:11,010
in a sense of His Shakti.

264
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:16,520
Because this means that you can’t behave
in the same old ways you used to behave.

265
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:23,270
You can’t be attached to the same old things
which you used to be attached to.

266
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:54,800
You have to change, you see.

267
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Ready?

268
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:56,800
Ok.

269
00:18:56,800 --> 00:19:01,650
And this is something that people don’t
understand.

270
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:05,160
And this is an avoidance of Sahaja Yoga, this
is running away from it.

271
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:09,310
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is the fact that
people have been …, human being has been

272
00:19:09,310 --> 00:19:14,930
taken, they have been given realization, they
have been made part of the body of the Divine

273
00:19:14,930 --> 00:19:19,480
and they have been given the opportunity to
raise their awareness to the highest level

274
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:20,650
to attain God realization.

275
00:19:20,650 --> 00:19:22,260
That is it.

276
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:23,870
It’s very simple.

277
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:30,800
Everything else is a waste of time.

278
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:34,650
And one has to recognize that although we
may be Sahaja Yogis we do not run the Universe;

279
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:36,750
the Universe is run by us.

280
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:41,310
I mean, run for us by the Almighty.

281
00:19:41,310 --> 00:19:45,510
And run by us for the Almighty.

282
00:19:45,510 --> 00:19:49,570
We cannot decide this has to happen, this
has to happen, we have to have twenty people

283
00:19:49,570 --> 00:19:50,570
next week.

284
00:19:50,570 --> 00:19:51,830
Cannot happen.

285
00:19:51,830 --> 00:20:00,030
God decides how many people He wants, He decides
where and when, you just have to be instruments.

286
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:05,160
Not one of us can change the Universe even
so much.

287
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:11,000
Unless we do it in the… on the crest of
a wave which precedes from the Almighty and

288
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,140
work as instruments.

289
00:20:13,140 --> 00:20:19,890
The old days of siddhic Yogis who ride on
clouds and transform mountains and hurl thunderbolts

290
00:20:19,890 --> 00:20:21,430
are over, you see.

291
00:20:21,430 --> 00:20:23,700
That was meant for people who are right sided.

292
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,960
Who wanted to do things themselves.

293
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:27,550
That is not us.

294
00:20:27,550 --> 00:20:30,060
We are parts of the body of the Goddess.

295
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:33,150
And each one of us has to be like e nerve
cell.

296
00:20:33,150 --> 00:20:36,000
When the brain tells us what to do, we have
to do it.

297
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,700
As such we are all collective.

298
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:41,770
That is the true collectivity.

299
00:20:41,770 --> 00:20:46,020
And if we… each of us recognize that we
are a nerve cell in the brain of the Goddess,

300
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:51,990
permeating Her whole being then the whole
boundaries between nationalities, and this

301
00:20:51,990 --> 00:20:54,470
and that which keeps Sahaja Yogis apart dissolves.

302
00:20:54,470 --> 00:21:00,490
We all realize we are one, we are the same,
that each one of us is individual and each

303
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:03,750
one of us has an individual relationship to
the Almighty.

304
00:21:03,750 --> 00:21:08,430
And all sorts of misidentifications fall away.

305
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:15,510
Now one speaks a common language, no doubt
about it, it is real.

306
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:16,980
And this is the common language of vibrations.

307
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:22,720
If you are there you do not know how but you
communicate with people who have a different

308
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
language.

309
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:26,270
It’s so simple really.

310
00:21:26,270 --> 00:21:32,050
So, I wish really in this lecture to make
you aware of what is been given in Sahaja

311
00:21:32,050 --> 00:21:33,050
Yoga.

312
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:38,900
What has been done by the Great Goddess in
Her absolute nature and for what purpose.

313
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:45,510
So that you do not waste neither time nor
energy on other things.

314
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:47,920
There is nothing greater than this.

315
00:21:47,920 --> 00:21:55,080
And since the Goddess Herself is All Powerful,
beyond time, beyond everything.

316
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:03,180
So, your awareness has to be of a nature that
can comprehend that and be one with that awareness.

317
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:06,780
You can become one with Her in awareness,
no doubt.

318
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:09,520
And see things as She sees things.

319
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:12,930
But for this your brain has to develop, you
see.

320
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:16,050
So, this is what one has to do.

321
00:22:16,050 --> 00:22:19,640
And really the rest of it is not important.

322
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:22,910
At that level, it doesn’t matter how time
passes.

323
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,310
At that level, it doesn’t matter whether
there are miracles or not because the whole

324
00:22:26,310 --> 00:22:29,470
concept of a miracle is non-existent.

325
00:22:29,470 --> 00:22:31,830
Everything follows the desire of the Absolute.

326
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:36,300
Who makes the rules that arbitrates between
a miracle and a non-miracle?

327
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:37,670
Humans beings.

328
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:39,710
It’s not God.

329
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:42,190
For God there is no such things as a miracle.

330
00:22:42,190 --> 00:22:44,410
Everything is possible to Him.

331
00:22:44,410 --> 00:22:54,530
So, what I’m saying is hitch your awareness
higher, hook it at the higher level, keep

332
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,530
it there.

333
00:22:55,530 --> 00:22:59,260
So that you see really what is happening.

334
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:04,890
And do not, in spite of everything that has
been given, continue to move in the same circles,

335
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:09,130
low circles that one inhabited before one’s
realization.

336
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:10,652
This is very important.

337
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:16,560
This is so important that I don’t know how
to say it.

338
00:23:16,560 --> 00:23:23,640
Work to increase the structure and capacity
of one’s brain, so that you can comprehend

339
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:27,460
that which is Absolute.

340
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:35,310
I do not know if there is anything more to
say to this.

341
00:23:35,310 --> 00:23:41,540
I remember once a long time back when I first
met Shri Mataji, Gregoire was there, lots

342
00:23:41,540 --> 00:23:43,720
of other chappies were there jumping around
with me.

343
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:48,770
I remember one, early one morning after we
slept with Her in a flat in London, I was

344
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:52,970
talking to Her and She says… you see…
we were talking about Maya.

345
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:55,110
And I said, “Mother, I wish I could go beyond
Maya."

346
00:23:55,110 --> 00:24:00,120
And She said to me, this was some seven or
eight years ago, and She said to me, “One

347
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,400
day you will, you will catch me."

348
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:07,560
She said, “You will catch me."

349
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:13,970
And what I’m trying to say, is that this
is what we should all aim for.

350
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,930
Try to go beyond that.

351
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:21,200
And you can only go beyond that when you can
touch the feet of the Absolute.

352
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:26,060
The Absolute is like a mountain peak which
raises above the clouds.

353
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:30,410
You cannot rise above the clouds until you
rest on that mountain peak.

354
00:24:30,410 --> 00:24:36,010
So, you cannot rise above Maya, it is impossible
until your awareness touches the feet of the

355
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:37,760
Absolute.

356
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:44,670
Because above Maya there is nothing but the
Absolute, The Atma Tattwa.

357
00:24:44,670 --> 00:24:54,910
You know, the Atma Tattwa rests in the Heart
of God the Almighty and ascends to dance in

358
00:24:54,910 --> 00:24:57,640
the Sahastrara as Sadashiva.

359
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:00,220
So, the heart is a very important organ.

360
00:25:00,220 --> 00:25:05,180
Rajabhai said that when Shri Mataji gave him
realization, She said, “You young men have

361
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:09,760
such hard hearts."

362
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:10,910
And She was true in the sense.

363
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,330
Most people do have hard hearts.

364
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:14,730
Not necessary their fault.

365
00:25:14,730 --> 00:25:19,500
It may be the result of their experiences
in this world.

366
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:20,960
But one’s heart should be like a lotus.

367
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,230
I don’t know how many of you have touched
a lotus.

368
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:27,120
But the petals are so soft, like silk.

369
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:33,040
The heart of a man should be as soft as that.

370
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,650
You see, we have got our realization regardless
of everything we have done.

371
00:25:38,650 --> 00:25:44,550
By the grace of God, the Almighty, by His
compassion, profound compassion, profound

372
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:48,210
love for mankind, for the children of His
Shakti.

373
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:52,460
He has granted – He says forget everything,
forget it, forget it.

374
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,700
Forgive, you see, I forgive them.

375
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:55,830
I forgive them.

376
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:59,680
We have to be the same in our hearts to the
rest of the mankind.

377
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:04,510
When the disciples of Christ, Peter I think,
once came to Christ and asked them: “How

378
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:06,690
often should I forgive my brothers, seven
times?”

379
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,560
And He said, “No, seventy times seven."

380
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:15,780
And what He meant was infinitely.

381
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:19,580
You see, one cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi,
this is my belief, unless one is kind, and

382
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,720
one is gentle.

383
00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,990
Kindness and gentle doesn’t mean weakness.

384
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:32,240
It means being soft, trying to further the
other person from one’s heart, caring for

385
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,360
what Shri Mataji once called in Her lecture,
caring for his hita [benevolence].

386
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:40,910
Try to see what is… how to do that which
is best for him, how to manipulate him in

387
00:26:40,910 --> 00:26:44,990
such a way that he raises.

388
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:52,220
It means, going beyond oneself, you see, when
someone is harsh with you, is he harsh with

389
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:53,220
you?

390
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,820
If you are Atma how he can be harsh with you?

391
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:59,770
If you are the Atma you can bear it all.

392
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:02,880
And in spite of that try and resolve.

393
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:13,410
The only thing we cannot really be expected
to tolerate is any insult to the Goddess Herself.

394
00:27:13,410 --> 00:27:16,330
There we have to be strong and firm.

395
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:21,240
But it doesn’t mean that we take justice
in our own hands.

396
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,650
Justice is …, belongs to the Almighty, not
to us.

397
00:27:25,650 --> 00:27:28,000
Christ also said, “Judge not that ye be
not judged."

398
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,630
Made it very clear, that we have no right
to judge.

399
00:27:31,630 --> 00:27:35,360
We are not going to be sitting there, at the
end writing out who should go to hell and

400
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:36,780
who should go to heaven.

401
00:27:36,780 --> 00:27:39,580
It is going to be done by someone else.

402
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,650
So, we cannot judge.

403
00:27:41,650 --> 00:27:49,020
We have to leave it to God to judge and for
us to execute.

404
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:55,110
We cannot abrogate to ourselves any of the
qualities of the Almighty, such as justice,

405
00:27:55,110 --> 00:27:57,570
judgment, decisiveness, planning.

406
00:27:57,570 --> 00:28:00,010
These belong to Him.

407
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,470
We merely execute these.

408
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:11,950
But when we are kind to a fellow man, to any
living thing that moves, within the context

409
00:28:11,950 --> 00:28:18,130
of its dharma on this world, we make the Lord
happy.

410
00:28:18,130 --> 00:28:21,970
By this I don’t mean that one goes around
like jains, not trying to kill insects because

411
00:28:21,970 --> 00:28:25,060
it is in the dharma of the insects to be crushed
beneath the feet of man.

412
00:28:25,060 --> 00:28:29,400
We’ve been both created this way that it
has… it is an inevitable outcome of living

413
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:30,430
a normal life.

414
00:28:30,430 --> 00:28:33,400
One doesn’t go crazy, you see.

415
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:34,400
We have to eat.

416
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:39,750
Chicken, I mean it doesn’t mean you don’t
slaughter a chicken to be kind to it.

417
00:28:39,750 --> 00:28:42,240
We have to live within the boundaries.

418
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,090
But there is no place for unnecessary cruelty
in this world.

419
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:50,510
The Lord is not cruel.

420
00:28:50,510 --> 00:28:55,330
And if we are to partake of his essence and
of his nature we have to be like Him.

421
00:28:55,330 --> 00:29:06,120
So, the message I’m trying to give you is
that in spite of all the splendor that surrounds

422
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:11,190
the Goddess and there must be because She
is, after all, the Shri Adi Shakti, do not

423
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:16,201
forget that the deepest desire in our heart,
the Shuddha Ichha, is to raise you to the

424
00:29:16,201 --> 00:29:22,970
feet of Her Lord as offerings worthy of Him.

425
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:32,510
And in all Her drama She tries constantly
in Her movement to bring you to that point.

426
00:29:32,510 --> 00:29:35,850
And I tell you that there is nothing else
in the Universe worth bothering about except

427
00:29:35,850 --> 00:29:37,500
this fact.

428
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:45,320
If you love your Mother try to be worthy to
be offered by Her to Her Consort.

429
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:55,200
And if you love your Father try to be worthy
to be offered to Him.

430
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:01,010
And if you love Them both this will work out
inevitably because Their love will work through

431
00:30:01,010 --> 00:30:10,000
your heart, and the two will mingle, and you
cannot help but ascent.

432
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,780
Live by your hearts not by your brains.

433
00:30:12,780 --> 00:30:17,780
That is not by your egos and superegos and
question the inner desires of your heart.

434
00:30:17,780 --> 00:30:18,780
Do not question them.

435
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,820
You cannot question them.

436
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,740
They are beyond logic.

437
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:23,740
Live by your heart.

438
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:31,100
If you express your heart you will lead to
such a sense of satisfaction with life that

439
00:30:31,100 --> 00:30:33,520
you cannot be angry with anyone.

440
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:38,670
You will be so happy all the time that it’ll
be effortless for your Parents to lift you

441
00:30:38,670 --> 00:30:43,230
to that level which was your destiny at the
moment of your creation.

442
00:30:43,230 --> 00:30:45,440
That is all I have to say.

443
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:50,700
Jai Shri Mataji.
