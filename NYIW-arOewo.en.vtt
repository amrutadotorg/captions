00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.893
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:13.766 --> 00:00:20.933
We have had three lectures before this, 
about the experience of truth

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:28.792
and today is the fourth one and the last 
on the subject of experience of truth.

00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:39.073
In the first lecture I described what is truth, 
how to recognise truth

00:00:40.273 --> 00:00:46.179
and that’s how we proceeded till today,

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:51.374
and today we have to get to the finale,

00:00:51.975 --> 00:01:00.795
that is the enjoyment of the bliss of truth.

00:01:04.513 --> 00:01:12.876
The first one was as I told you, 
before was the experience of truth

00:01:12.956 --> 00:01:18.062
which one has to feel 
on the central nervous system.

00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:24.748
Into a new collective consciousness, 
was the second one

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:32.019
and the third one we talked 
about the transformation that takes place.

00:01:33.358 --> 00:01:48.357
But the final is the nature of Divine.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:56.422
People say divine is purity,

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:59.252
divine is blissful,

00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:04.233
divine is compassion, divine is love,

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.745
it is described by many words, 
but I don’t think it can be described.

00:02:09.825 --> 00:02:12.387
It has to be experienced.

00:02:12.467 --> 00:02:16.287
You can go on describing, writing books after books,

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:20.270
stories after stories, poems after poems,

00:02:20.357 --> 00:02:24.954
divine is so unlimited that you cannot describe it

00:02:25.034 --> 00:02:28.277
in it’s full extent, nor in it’s depth,

00:02:28.357 --> 00:02:36.609
but as it is being described that the spirit is the truth.

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.476
So the first three lectures
I covered the subject of truth within us,

00:02:42.476 --> 00:02:46.302
that we have to feel it in 
our evolutionary process;

00:02:46.302 --> 00:02:50.703
the truth on our central nervous system.

00:02:50.703 --> 00:02:55.095
That’s a very important point
we have to understand,

00:02:55.095 --> 00:02:58.902
because anything that people
tell you or project

00:02:58.982 --> 00:03:04.165
is not the truth.
Nor whatever you project is not the truth,

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:09.079
but whatever you feel on the central
nervous system is the truth.

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:14.136
Like you feel something hot or cold,
everybody feels the same

00:03:14.136 --> 00:03:17.421
and that’s how it is the absolute,

00:03:17.421 --> 00:03:22.289
but the truth that is within us

00:03:22.369 --> 00:03:29.610
and which manifests within our being
is known through our brain.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:36.812
So yesterday somebody asked me a question
that the intelligence is very much needed?

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:42.219
Yes that much intelligence everyone has,
to know what is truth.

00:03:42.219 --> 00:03:47.520
But before knowing the truth
if you depend on your intelligence

00:03:47.613 --> 00:03:49.959
you can be misled completely.

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:59.205
Intelligence that is without the spiritual insight
is your own ego.

00:03:59.205 --> 00:04:04.870
Is not pure intelligence, it is just your ego
which says this is right,

00:04:04.937 --> 00:04:10.990
“I say, I believe I am like this”, that is ego.

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:14.976
After realisation the truth that comes to you

00:04:15.056 --> 00:04:20.132
is the real pure truth and is not your ego.

00:04:20.219 --> 00:04:26.230
For example now we are in this hall,
I have been here before or not,

00:04:26.344 --> 00:04:29.425
whether I was in this place or not?

00:04:29.505 --> 00:04:34.246
How will you know? It’s not possible.

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:37.178
But for a realised soul it is very easy
to make out

00:04:37.258 --> 00:04:40.939
because they can feel the vibrations of the place.

00:04:41.052 --> 00:04:48.248
They can make out that somebody here
has been a person who had self-realisation

00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:53.562
and now in this hall there are so much vibrations
that even to speak to you

00:04:53.642 --> 00:04:56.466
I have to watch it’s just flowing!

00:04:56.546 --> 00:04:58.778
If those who can feel it can feel it.

00:04:58.858 --> 00:05:03.630
But those who cannot feel it, for them
is just the same, no difference at all.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:11.742
So when the truth is felt within us,
our intelligence tells us is the same thing.

00:05:11.742 --> 00:05:16.033
If you are inert, people say like this stone,
or this thing,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:18.613
it might suck in the vibrations.

00:05:18.613 --> 00:05:22.287
It may have the vibrations
and now see the point, the differences,

00:05:22.287 --> 00:05:29.502
but it will not be intelligent,
or it is not intelligible to that particular matter.

00:05:29.502 --> 00:05:37.396
So the matter when it is inert
is not sensitive to understand,

00:05:37.476 --> 00:05:40.564
it is different to absorb vibrations.

00:05:40.564 --> 00:05:46.391
But it is very difficult unless and until
you are a human being to discern it,

00:05:46.471 --> 00:05:51.473
to find out whether there are vibrations or not.

00:05:51.473 --> 00:05:57.629
Like we would say that,
I went once to Kashmir, with my husband

00:05:57.881 --> 00:06:01.622
and we were going out somewhere in the wilderness

00:06:01.702 --> 00:06:05.113
and suddenly I felt tremendous vibrations
 in that place.

00:06:05.113 --> 00:06:07.860
So I told the driver there must be
something great here,

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:09.947
is there a temple or is there a mosque?

00:06:09.947 --> 00:06:12.523
He said nothing this all wilderness.

00:06:12.523 --> 00:06:16.412
I said lets go the way we get the vibrations,

00:06:16.412 --> 00:06:19.782
so I asked him you drive on this side,
and we came on a road you see,

00:06:19.782 --> 00:06:22.991
crossing through something, we came on a road,

00:06:22.991 --> 00:06:26.818
and on that road and we found
there were some poor people living

00:06:26.899 --> 00:06:29.800
and some other people just walking about.

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:33.525
So I asked them have you got any temple here?

00:06:33.525 --> 00:06:38.062
They said no, we have nothing, but we have further,
if you go, there’s a mosque.

00:06:38.062 --> 00:06:41.830
What is that mosque? It’s called as Hazarat Bhal

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:47.086
means one hair of Mohammed Sahib
is kept in that place.

00:06:47.219 --> 00:06:52.778
I said really, just imagine!
One hair of Mohammed Sahib was kept in that place

00:06:52.778 --> 00:06:56.827
and I caught it up at least five miles away.

00:06:56.827 --> 00:07:04.832
So that you can imagine that hair
may not be aware of the vibrations it has,

00:07:04.832 --> 00:07:09.126
but the one who is a human being
and a realised soul

00:07:09.206 --> 00:07:12.142
gets the awareness five miles away from that hair,

00:07:12.142 --> 00:07:18.302
that there lies the hair of Mohammed Sahib.

00:07:18.302 --> 00:07:22.585
Now for this hair there has been big quarrel
and fight and this and that

00:07:22.665 --> 00:07:24.782
and then it was replaced, all sorts of things,

00:07:24.862 --> 00:07:31.356
but the ones who were fighting
even for that do not know what it is.

00:07:31.356 --> 00:07:33.697
Just fighting for nothing at all.

00:07:33.697 --> 00:07:46.558
Like that you can see that those things
which have got, we can say matter in it,

00:07:46.691 --> 00:07:52.362
same matter becomes a human being
after sometime through evolutionary process

00:07:52.362 --> 00:07:58.256
and the same thing which was just a matter
when it becomes a human being,

00:07:58.256 --> 00:08:03.792
becomes aware of those divine vibrations.

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:09.231
Before that it can not, so we cancel out
all the animals.

00:08:09.724 --> 00:08:13.186
I had a dog which used to vibrate,
 if anybody came,

00:08:13.267 --> 00:08:17.280
they used to say Mother what vibrations
coming from this dog.

00:08:18.306 --> 00:08:27.099
And it used to feel if some man with nasty feelings
or something would come in the house,

00:08:27.099 --> 00:08:30.469
he knew it was, so it used to bark on that.

00:08:30.550 --> 00:08:37.270
He knew many things but he was not aware
that he had vibrations,

00:08:38.016 --> 00:08:41.915
he could not feel himself
that he had vibrations.

00:08:41.915 --> 00:08:45.513
He kept a very good health
and was a pedigree

00:08:45.513 --> 00:08:50.241
dog but the doctor said that this dog is remarkable
for his own pedigree,

00:08:50.241 --> 00:08:54.182
he’s too tall and too broad
and very healthy you see,

00:08:54.182 --> 00:08:58.642
but because of the vibrations he kept up
that kind of health.

00:08:58.723 --> 00:09:02.268
So one has to understand
that you become the truth,

00:09:02.268 --> 00:09:09.185
means your awareness itself
becomes aware of Divine.

00:09:11.657 --> 00:09:15.076
That your central nervous system,
or you can say that your brain

00:09:15.156 --> 00:09:21.643
evolves to that state that you can feel
the vibrations.

00:09:21.903 --> 00:09:23.817
That’s one thing.

00:09:23.897 --> 00:09:29.524
Then you can not only feel the vibrations
but you can discern them,

00:09:29.537 --> 00:09:37.533
you can find out whether these are
good vibrations or bad vibrations.

00:09:39.299 --> 00:09:42.294
Then you can also say whether

00:09:42.374 --> 00:09:47.009
these vibrations are partial or full vibrations
from the person,

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:50.745
if the person has got some sort
of a disease or a trouble,

00:09:50.745 --> 00:09:54.080
you can without knowing
a word about medicine,

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.687
you can say this person is suffering
from such and such diseases.

00:09:59.380 --> 00:10:01.169
Imagine the computer that we are,

00:10:01.249 --> 00:10:06.079
we are really the greatest computer
that anybody can produce.

00:10:06.079 --> 00:10:09.474
Human beings can’t produce this computer.

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:15.947
The one they have produced is just a copy of this
which is not such a great copy also,

00:10:16.114 --> 00:10:22.323
because this computer sees something
and knows this is this, it doesn’t think.

00:10:22.404 --> 00:10:25.775
Can you think of a computer
which doesn’t think?

00:10:25.775 --> 00:10:29.368
Just without thinking it knows.

00:10:29.448 --> 00:10:31.896
And that’s the computer we are.

00:10:31.896 --> 00:10:36.968
Now this great computer of our brain
which just sees and knows,

00:10:36.968 --> 00:10:44.921
feels and knows, smells and knows,
this special computer becomes

00:10:45.167 --> 00:10:51.130
a greater, we can say subtler instrument

00:10:51.217 --> 00:10:54.680
which knows the divine, which feels the divine,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:01.263
which understands the divine
and can manoeuvre it,

00:11:01.343 --> 00:11:02.949
it can manoeuvre it.
