00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,759
Sahaja Yogi: This is the recording of the
advice given by Her Holiness Shri Mataji on

2
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:13,519
the occasion of three days seminar held at
Cowasji Jehangir Hall [Mumbai] from 19 to

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,110
21st March 1976.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:26,490
This is a recording of the first day that
is of the 19th March 1976.

5
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:46,249
Shri Mataji: After a very long time, we are
again assembled in this hall.

6
00:00:46,249 --> 00:01:11,910
When Sahaja Yoga was just in its infancy,
we had arranged a program in this hall.

7
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:40,220
Since then, by God’s grace, Sahaja Yoga
has settled, in the minds of the Sahaja Yogis.

8
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:54,430
As if the rain has been absorbed by the hungry
Earth.

9
00:01:54,430 --> 00:02:04,580
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for people who are
superficial and are not seeking within themselves

10
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:10,899
and with all the earnestness and the hankering
of all seekers.

11
00:02:10,899 --> 00:02:20,390
It is not meant for people who are seeking
God in the books.

12
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,159
Because God is not there.

13
00:02:24,159 --> 00:02:33,599
It is also not meant for people who think
they can achieve God.

14
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:45,680
That they can by their efforts, by their extreme
‘hatha‘ as we call it, ‘obstinacy’,

15
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,480
win the grace of God.

16
00:02:48,480 --> 00:03:01,109
It is meant for those people who are, from
the heart, all the time asking for Him.

17
00:03:01,109 --> 00:03:06,230
And looking for Him, for the genuine and for
the reality.

18
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:22,459
‘Sahaja’ – I have told you many a time,
‘saha’ means ‘within’ and ‘ja’

19
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:25,780
means ‘born with you’.

20
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,359
I have elaborately told you many a time what
is ‘sahaja‘.

21
00:03:31,359 --> 00:03:39,700
It is a ‘spontaneous’ growth of your being
into that infinite realm of God’s grace.

22
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:44,950
We have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

23
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:52,109
Not by words, not by deeds, but it has to
be the actualisation of the experience.

24
00:03:52,109 --> 00:04:03,840
If you are satisfied by the tomfoolery and
the spiritual jugglery that is going on, it

25
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,930
is better that you take to that course and
be lost.

26
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:14,830
But for Sahaja, you have to be an earnest
and genuine seeker.

27
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:24,200
Whatever mistakes you have committed in your
search will be forgiven by God, because He

28
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:30,410
knows that it was in ignorance that all these
mistakes were committed.

29
00:04:30,410 --> 00:04:37,080
We have here some Sahaja Yogis who know this.

30
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:48,310
But when I see people, and I have experience
of them, I am sometimes surprised the way

31
00:04:48,310 --> 00:04:50,729
they are contradictory to themselves.

32
00:04:50,729 --> 00:04:56,979
How they live with those contradictory ideas;
it is something beyond the imagination of

33
00:04:56,979 --> 00:04:59,960
God Almighty also.

34
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:13,419
It has been since ages, one simple question,
“How to reach the Infinite, through this

35
00:05:13,419 --> 00:05:19,660
finite mind, through this rationality which
God has given us."

36
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:29,280
This is the eternal problem which has been
there from the times of Socrates, Confucius,

37
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:30,560
Kant, Hegel.

38
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:38,659
All these great philosophers have been only
asking this question in all their findings

39
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:48,850
and searches, “How to reach the Infinite
through this finite?”

40
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:54,409
As it is, the human being is made that way,
that he has to worry for himself and also

41
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,439
worry about God’s knowing.

42
00:05:55,439 --> 00:06:00,330
He is also worried about how God is going
to give him this blessing.

43
00:06:00,330 --> 00:06:02,830
Who has created you?

44
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,960
Who has created this Universe?

45
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:12,789
Who has created this beautiful heaven for
you here?

46
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:18,560
But you are worried how He is going to give
you that blessing by which you will know the

47
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,349
heaven within yourself.

48
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:30,900
You are worried how He is going to bestow
upon you the bliss of self-knowledge.

49
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,470
You need not worry.

50
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:40,160
It is His job.

51
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:45,780
But He has made you like this.

52
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,840
He has made you this way, especially, with
a purpose.

53
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,659
The articulation of your personality came
into being.

54
00:06:53,659 --> 00:07:02,889
Just like any egg develops a shell around
itself to grow, in the same way, you also

55
00:07:02,889 --> 00:07:12,879
develop a shell in which you have to develop
your personality, your being in such a manner

56
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:22,061
that ultimately you become the proper instrument
to receive that knowledge that is God, that

57
00:07:22,061 --> 00:07:23,469
is Divine.

58
00:07:23,469 --> 00:07:28,419
And then to emit it to others.

59
00:07:28,419 --> 00:07:30,810
And to see it.

60
00:07:30,810 --> 00:07:31,810
To be aware of it.

61
00:07:31,810 --> 00:07:32,810
To be a Sakshi.

62
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:35,940
To be a witness.

63
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:43,510
Of that Divine flowing through you.

64
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:50,750
Of course, some of these philosophers never
had any inkling of that Divine.

65
00:07:50,750 --> 00:07:57,900
Some of them did have; that is why there is
such a disparity to what they say.

66
00:07:57,900 --> 00:08:02,699
But then have been really genuine people,
most of them.

67
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:08,499
And they have been honest about not finding
it or finding it.

68
00:08:08,499 --> 00:08:18,180
But today, it is the worst time of hypocrisy,
known as Kali Yuga, in which every Dick, Tom,

69
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:24,220
Harry has started claiming that he is the
person who is going to introduce you to Him.

70
00:08:24,220 --> 00:08:32,590
And he has formed his own ideas and his own
imagination to give you that, this is how

71
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:38,050
you are going to receive Him, “I have got
it, all right."

72
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:45,740
There is one good thing about Kali Yuga I
think – that all the ancient scriptures

73
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:48,899
are for you written down a long time back.

74
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:50,440
And you have to tally.

75
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:54,080
If it is the Bible, it is there.

76
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:57,180
If it is Koran, it is there.

77
00:08:57,180 --> 00:09:01,150
And if it is anyone of the Vedas, it is there.

78
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:06,680
But when you start your new scriptures and
new ideologies and try to fit in everything

79
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:22,670
according to that, when you try to mould God
into your own sorts of weaknesses, then how

80
00:09:22,670 --> 00:09:25,620
can you be sahaj, spontaneous?

81
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:29,750
So, the problem today is Kali Yuga.

82
00:09:29,750 --> 00:09:34,470
Is much worse than it was ever before.

83
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:47,850
Because apart from the original articulation
we have had, we have many more articulations

84
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:50,200
on us.

85
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:57,740
The worst of all is the mental articulation,
that we think by reading books, by talking

86
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:04,510
about it, by giving lectures and receiving
lectures, you are going to achieve it.

87
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:06,860
You are sadly mistaken.

88
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:13,260
This is the greatest maya or illusion, I think,
of the present.

89
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:23,490
Other mayas can be conquered, but this is
one of the most elusive temptations for the

90
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:34,490
modern man, that he thinks by reading, by
listening about God, he is going to achieve.

91
00:10:34,490 --> 00:10:37,690
It is spontaneous.

92
00:10:37,690 --> 00:10:40,839
Let us understand what is spontaneous.

93
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:46,550
Spontaneous is a natural, living thing that
happens to us.

94
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,089
For example, if you see a seed – if you
plant it, it spontaneously grows.

95
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:56,019
Do you stand on your head in front of that
seed?

96
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:57,810
Or do you read books?

97
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:04,530
Or does the seed have to read books of germination,
to get germinated?

98
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:05,530
Not that.

99
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:06,530
Never!

100
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:17,600
But it is only a human being who thinks foolishly,
which an ordinary dog also does not do that.

101
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:27,459
You may say that; there are books which are
Truth, there are books which are pouring reality.

102
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:32,550
But have you got the measure to know which
are the books which are pouring reality, and

103
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,630
which are not?

104
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:43,279
There are gurus, who are of course prospering
materially better because they tell you to

105
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:49,470
take sanyasa, “You take sanyasa, you renounce
and bring all the money to me”.

106
00:11:49,470 --> 00:11:52,010
And foolishly so many human beings are attached
and attracted towards such people.

107
00:11:52,010 --> 00:11:53,010
Why?

108
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:56,579
Because our articulation has given way to
this darkness that we go to something false

109
00:11:56,579 --> 00:12:00,540
much faster than to reality.

110
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:05,279
We are shaken up within ourselves.

111
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:21,260
We do not have the strength to hold onto the
reality, to ask for the reality.

112
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,230
They have to give us reality!

113
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:30,930
So, anybody who speaks, you see, in a bombastic
manner, quotations over quotations, reading

114
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:36,880
this, reading that, giving big lectures; people
are very much fascinated.

115
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,800
They think by listening to lectures, you are
going to have it.

116
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,800
Never, never.

117
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:47,070
It is going to happen to you.

118
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:50,339
You have been to so many lectures before.

119
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:52,040
You have listened to so many people.

120
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:56,360
There have been many gurus – good and bad.

121
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:06,759
Have you been able to make out who is a real
guru and who is not?

122
00:13:06,759 --> 00:13:11,900
How will you know that this man is talking
from the seventh heaven?

123
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:15,350
It may be a rakshasa, talking to you.

124
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:21,449
It may be a devil incarnated in these horrible
days.

125
00:13:21,449 --> 00:13:30,620
He could be anything who is talking to you.

126
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:40,270
What makes you believe that some person who
is behaving like a godman is a real godman

127
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,579
or not?

128
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:44,190
There is a way.

129
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:57,910
And that is why, when is more necessary, the
things happen by which you know.

130
00:13:57,910 --> 00:14:03,040
You have to become something else to know
what is wrong.

131
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:05,730
You have to be reborn.

132
00:14:05,730 --> 00:14:07,930
You have to be baptized.

133
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,040
You have to become a Brahmin.

134
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:15,070
You have to become a Mussalman.

135
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,139
You have to become a Christian.

136
00:14:21,139 --> 00:14:22,139
You are to be reborn.

137
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:24,267
You are born with a body; you are born with
a mind which is articulated.

138
00:14:24,267 --> 00:14:33,430
You have to jump into that Infinite Love of
God to know Who is emitting that Love.

139
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:37,690
And then the knowledge comes to you.

140
00:14:37,690 --> 00:14:43,900
Unless and until your eyes are opened, don’t
believe into any personality because he knows

141
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:51,620
how to impress you people, and even not Me,
unless and until I give you everything, I

142
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:59,860
give you that which you are seeking.

143
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,069
You must ask for the Reality.

144
00:15:02,069 --> 00:15:05,750
Ask for that from Me.

145
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:09,709
I cannot give you anything else but that.

146
00:15:09,709 --> 00:15:20,579
Unless and until you have had that experience,
the actualisation of that, of the Sahaja Yoga

147
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:27,330
by which you receive the blessings within
yourselves and you feel it and it emits through

148
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:28,330
your extremities.

149
00:15:28,330 --> 00:15:34,149
And you see that power flowing through you
which is known as the Chaitanya Lahari [Waves

150
00:15:34,149 --> 00:15:39,649
of Bliss] which was very well described by
Adi Shankaracharya, whom nobody reads these

151
00:15:39,649 --> 00:15:40,649
days.

152
00:15:40,649 --> 00:15:43,350
They want to read somebody who talks of sex.

153
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:51,690
The mind is so much attached to sex, that
everything must come through sex; otherwise,

154
00:15:51,690 --> 00:15:54,060
nothing goes here.

155
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:58,550
These people who try to impress you try to
work on your weakness.

156
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:02,500
But a Mother is not going to do that.

157
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:10,190
A Mother is going to give you the real that
is there and is going to tell you that, “My

158
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:30,149
child, this has been wrong and you have to
get detached from that idea.

159
00:16:30,149 --> 00:16:31,149
And stand within yourselves."

160
00:16:31,149 --> 00:16:35,360
Every one of them, those who have been great,
has been saying, “Na yoga, na sankya”

161
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:36,610
[neither yoga nor reasoning] – Shankaracharya’s.

162
00:16:36,610 --> 00:16:39,860
But Hindus are the first who will go to yoga
– to hatha yoga.

163
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,560
When Shankaracharya never did anyone of these
yoga’s.

164
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,779
Yoga’s are meant for very, very few people.

165
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,920
For very few people who live with a guru,
in the jungles.

166
00:16:54,920 --> 00:17:01,540
You have to do six things simultaneously under
the guidance of an evolved soul.

167
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:06,880
But everybody is trying to do yoga because
they want to slim down.

168
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:10,750
God is not to be used for these frivolous
things.

169
00:17:10,750 --> 00:17:12,630
All right, you do exercises.

170
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:15,819
But this is not yoga.

171
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:18,240
Yoga means ‘union with God’.

172
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:22,140
It is union with God.

173
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:36,910
It is not union with the worldly things that
you think so important.

174
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:49,300
Those who go to the extremes of things are
also no good for Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:53,020
Extreme takes you away from reality which
was said by Gautama Buddha.

176
00:17:53,020 --> 00:17:57,670
He said, “Take to the middle path, keep
to the middle path."

177
00:17:57,670 --> 00:18:02,130
But His disciples have gone to the extreme
path.

178
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:03,130
Of foolishness.

179
00:18:03,130 --> 00:18:11,950
He said, “Do not worship any Gods or Goddesses
at that time”, because He was in sahaja.

180
00:18:11,950 --> 00:18:17,080
So, His disciples started worshipping his
tooth, nail, everything.

181
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:21,070
Of course, that too has a meaning.

182
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,590
But not for people who are not realised.

183
00:18:23,590 --> 00:18:33,710
How can you make out that the hair of Mohammad
Saheb is in that place in Kashmir or it is

184
00:18:33,710 --> 00:18:35,450
of some imposter?

185
00:18:35,450 --> 00:18:40,780
Have you got any method by which you can detect?

186
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:44,280
I can say that it is the hair of Mohammad
Saheb.

187
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,280
I say that.

188
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:48,690
But why should you accept me also?

189
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:55,780
With all your brains and intelligence, why
should you accept anything which is not actually

190
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:58,510
focused within your awareness?

191
00:18:58,510 --> 00:19:03,960
Which is not actually brought within your
awareness.

192
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:06,680
There is a method.

193
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,280
There is a way.

194
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:11,010
There is an education.

195
00:19:11,010 --> 00:19:13,700
But it is a spontaneous one.

196
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,840
It happens to you.

197
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,520
You just become.

198
00:19:18,520 --> 00:19:29,860
This education comes to you in such a manner,
in such a way, that even a child knows.

199
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:35,300
It is a subjective knowledge that comes to
you.

200
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:43,220
When you jump into that Divine Love through
Sahaja Yoga, then you become one with the

201
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:48,980
collective consciousness.

202
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:52,850
It is not that I tell you that you are collectively
conscious, but you become conscious.

203
00:19:52,850 --> 00:20:03,549
For example, now, for Me, when I say that
this sari has got a border, you will say,

204
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:04,499
“Yes of course we know."
