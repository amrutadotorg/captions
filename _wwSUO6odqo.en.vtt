00:00:02.158 --> 00:00:05.243
Its very interesting the way you have found out

00:00:05.577 --> 00:00:09.577
today is the real Guru Purnima.

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.577
The Purnima is the day when the moon is full.

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.660
I knew this but for Sahaja Yogis we have to arrange

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.952
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Friday,Saturday, Sunday.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:29.160
Whenever it is, whether it is on that date or not, we have to arrange

00:00:29.368 --> 00:00:30.077
so it in that case,

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:39.577
this time it was I think two days before So it doesn't matter,

00:00:39.869 --> 00:00:44.869
after all, moon is there for us and we are for moon,

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.077
so it can't be some thing that would have very wrong in it.

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:04.577
I have already told you such a lot about the Guru principle.

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.869
And the guru principle,

00:01:08.077 --> 00:01:13.077
we have seen people who came on this Earth

00:01:13.285 --> 00:01:16.077
they were all mostly born realised

00:01:16.368 --> 00:01:20.660
actually, and they never gave realisation to anyone

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:22.160
it's a very big difference.

00:01:22.493 --> 00:01:30.077
They were all born as realised souls and they  became Sufis

00:01:30.368 --> 00:01:33.077
and they are called by different names,

00:01:33.368 --> 00:01:39.285
but they were not given self realisation, they had it

00:01:39.577 --> 00:01:43.660
and because of their self realisation as they had,

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:46.160
they have so much of knowledge

00:01:46.493 --> 00:01:50.785
and that is  what they try to impart to people.

00:01:52.997 --> 00:01:56.660
They knew all about Chakras everything they knew,

00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:03.660
somehow, must be in their past life achievements that they knew it,

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:11.869
perhaps some of them were disciples of  other very great people.

00:02:12.201 --> 00:02:16.201
I don't know how they had full ideas to

00:02:18.493 --> 00:02:21.077
what is self realisation is

00:02:21.368 --> 00:02:25.702
what do we achieve after self realisation .

00:02:26.493 --> 00:02:30.785
Now the only person, I think, Mohammed Sahib, is the one

00:02:31.077 --> 00:02:36.493
who has talked about Miraj is the ascent

00:02:36.702 --> 00:02:41.077
Miraj is the ascent through our Kundalini.

00:02:41.493 --> 00:02:44.285
Of course in India they did talked about it,

00:02:44.577 --> 00:02:48.077
but in any other country they didn't say it so clearly

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:50.785
that there is something called Miraj.

00:02:51.077 --> 00:02:54.493
And, not only that He talked of Miraj

00:02:54.785 --> 00:03:02.493
but also he talked of the resurrection time

00:03:02.785 --> 00:03:05.077
when your hands will speak.

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.702
Two things He said,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.410
first that your hands will speak

00:03:10.702 --> 00:03:13.910
when you will get your realisation .

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:18.493
It's a very great thing to say

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:23.285
because that is how you can ascertain and you can be sure

00:03:23.577 --> 00:03:26.285
that you got your realisation.

00:03:26.577 --> 00:03:28.577
That's the sign He gave,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:32.410
and the second thing He talked about Miraj

00:03:32.702 --> 00:03:36.618
and the white horse He said was nothing  but the Kundalini,

00:03:36.785 --> 00:03:41.994
He didn't used the word Kundalini but He said it's a white horse.

00:03:42.285 --> 00:03:48.119
So He is the one who knew what should happen to the

00:03:48.285 --> 00:03:50.119
people when they got their self realisation.

00:03:50.285 --> 00:03:54.618
That's the great revelation to all of you

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.618
and of such a help to Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.201
You are all realised souls

00:04:01.493 --> 00:04:05.410
because you can feel the vibrations one thing,

00:04:05.702 --> 00:04:11.702
and secondly how you have become He explained it very clearly.

00:04:11.994 --> 00:04:16.119
We have so many saints in India, so many of them,

00:04:16.326 --> 00:04:20.493
one better than the other and whatever they talked,

00:04:20.702 --> 00:04:25.827
whatever they say, is so remarkableâ€¦ is so remarkable.

00:04:26.119 --> 00:04:33.326
But actually, human beings, I  think we are very dumb,

00:04:33.618 --> 00:04:37.994
that they never realised that we have so many saints here.

00:04:38.326 --> 00:04:42.827
Even in Turkey we had Sufis where it's a Sunni religion,

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:46.119
there too, we had so many Sufis

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.119
all over the world. We had realised souls,

00:04:50.410 --> 00:04:55.326
they were not incarnations, but they were born realised souls.

00:04:55.618 --> 00:05:02.535
So you see their explanation and everything is very good  because

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:06.201
they were human beings and what ever they said

00:05:06.535 --> 00:05:12.035
was very much good for human beings to understand.

00:05:12.326 --> 00:05:14.410
Because an incarnation said something,

00:05:14.702 --> 00:05:16.535
it is something from the beyond

00:05:16.827 --> 00:05:20.535
and this new,

00:05:20.827 --> 00:05:26.618
I should say, advice of the people who were

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:32.618
really human beings and had become realised souls and

00:05:32.827 --> 00:05:37.035
how they have talked about the various things is very remarkable.

00:05:37.326 --> 00:05:39.743
Firstly most of them were poets

00:05:40.035 --> 00:05:45.410
and this, we had Kabir in India,

00:05:45.743 --> 00:05:47.618
we don't know how he was born,

00:05:47.827 --> 00:05:50.827
where he was from, who were his parents,

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:53.119
it's absolutely not known,

00:05:53.326 --> 00:05:58.910
despite that you can only make out from their poetry that

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:01.827
he was the great great Sahaj Yogi,

00:06:02.119 --> 00:06:04.910
and how he have described things very interesting.

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:10.535
He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry

00:06:10.827 --> 00:06:12.618
and he talked about it.

00:06:12.952 --> 00:06:15.827
He didn't belong to any religion, as such,

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:20.952
when he died there was a fight between Hindus and Muslims :

00:06:21.243 --> 00:06:25.451
what should we do with his body.

00:06:25.743 --> 00:06:30.743
And they say when they had lifted the sheet

00:06:31.119 --> 00:06:34.618
they found flowers, two types of flower one for Hindus

00:06:34.952 --> 00:06:39.535
and one for Muslims,

00:06:39.827 --> 00:06:41.952
so that's how he have solved the problems

00:06:42.119 --> 00:06:45.119
of this stupid fight people were having.

00:06:45.451 --> 00:06:51.618
In Sahaj Yoga we are not belonging to any such stupid religion,

00:06:51.952 --> 00:06:56.035
we belongs to one religion that is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma

00:06:56.326 --> 00:06:59.119
and all the stupidity of all these religions

00:06:59.326 --> 00:07:01.326
we should really throw away

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.743
because, what you just see now today

00:07:05.035 --> 00:07:08.660
every where, every religious group is fighting each other,

00:07:08.952 --> 00:07:12.326
beating each other, finishing each other,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.952
is not the way a religious person should be like that

00:07:18.243 --> 00:07:19.660
but  they are killing each other.

00:07:19.952 --> 00:07:22.827
I mean, all kind of  horrible things they are doing,

00:07:23.119 --> 00:07:27.952
unbelievable how they can do that, such cruelty.

00:07:28.243 --> 00:07:32.451
And first thing is for a yogi,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:38.952
or for a saint, cruelty is  absolutely not  there,

00:07:39.243 --> 00:07:43.035
they will sacrifice their lives, they will do any thing,

00:07:43.451 --> 00:07:45.535
but they will not be cruel to any other person.

00:07:45.869 --> 00:07:50.451
Now, those who in the name of God and in the religion are cruel

00:07:50.743 --> 00:07:55.119
are actually not at all by  any chances religious people.

00:07:55.451 --> 00:07:59.535
So this is what the perversion of religion is,

00:07:59.869 --> 00:08:03.368
we all should understand, if we belong to Sahaj Yoga

00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:09.368
then for us kindness, sweetness, compassion and love

00:08:09.660 --> 00:08:11.869
is the main quality we should have

00:08:12.119 --> 00:08:17.077
and if  you don't have that, then we are not Sahaj Yogis.

00:08:17.368 --> 00:08:20.451
So we are a different clan,

00:08:20.743 --> 00:08:26.077
I should say, a  different personalities,

00:08:26.368 --> 00:08:27.451
who are really realised souls,

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:32.869
who are above all these nonsensical ideas

00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:36.160
and who have vibrations.

00:08:36.451 --> 00:08:40.451
But, as I said, that now you must spread it

00:08:40.743 --> 00:08:42.869
because I have come on this Earth

00:08:43.077 --> 00:08:46.660
just for people to get their emancipation,

00:08:46.869 --> 00:08:48.952
get their realisation

00:08:49.285 --> 00:08:52.160
and unless and until all the people

00:08:52.368 --> 00:08:57.952
who believe in their emancipation get it, I won't be happy.

00:08:58.285 --> 00:08:59.785
There are many people who do believe

00:08:59.952 --> 00:09:03.577
but not yet got their realisation,

00:09:03.869 --> 00:09:06.785
so you have to work and you will be amazed

00:09:07.077 --> 00:09:10.577
you will find people who are very anxious to get their realisation.

00:09:10.869 --> 00:09:14.785
It will work out on this Guru Purnima day,

00:09:14.952 --> 00:09:16.577
it is a very auspicious day.

00:09:16.869 --> 00:09:20.368
I bless you with a special power

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:23.077
that you can give realisation to other.

00:09:23.368 --> 00:09:26.077
Don't get involved in your own problems,

00:09:26.368 --> 00:09:29.577
that's not important, that will all be solved.

00:09:29.869 --> 00:09:34.869
Mostly what I got letters about is their own personal problems

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.994
or some sort  of other problems.

00:09:37.285 --> 00:09:39.994
What you should do is to see what is your problem within you

00:09:40.285 --> 00:09:45.077
what is happening within you, why we are having a problem within,

00:09:45.493 --> 00:09:51.160
what is our duty, why we have got  our self realisation,

00:09:51.493 --> 00:09:55.368
why we   have got this wealth of spirituality

00:09:55.577 --> 00:09:57.869
and what should we do with it.

00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:02.077
I tell you really think about it every day,

00:10:02.368 --> 00:10:06.785
even for half an hour, you will realise that

00:10:07.077 --> 00:10:11.702
you are very well equipped people.

00:10:11.994 --> 00:10:16.201
Saints have done so much, they have written so many things

00:10:16.493 --> 00:10:18.702
they have fought the people, they did everything.

00:10:18.994 --> 00:10:20.577
You don't have to do anything like that,

00:10:20.869 --> 00:10:23.994
but one thing is that you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:25.285 --> 00:10:30.493
Even now Sahaj Yoga is not so much accepted everywhere,

00:10:30.785 --> 00:10:32.702
people don't know about it,

00:10:32.869 --> 00:10:36.577
it's surprising while all kinds of horrible gurus

00:10:36.785 --> 00:10:37.869
are very well known.

00:10:38.201 --> 00:10:41.577
So we have to do it by our behaviour,

00:10:41.910 --> 00:10:47.994
by our understanding, by our whole life, people should say

00:10:48.285 --> 00:10:51.910
that these are something rare people and different people.

00:10:52.201 --> 00:10:57.077
I am happy today is another day of Guru Purnima

00:10:57.285 --> 00:11:00.201
which is a very auspicious day

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:05.410
and to be regarded as a very big blessing for you

00:11:05.577 --> 00:11:09.410
because this gives you, I mean this is a certificate,

00:11:09.577 --> 00:11:13.910
that you all are capable of being Gurus.

00:11:14.201 --> 00:11:15.785
You have to become that,

00:11:15.994 --> 00:11:20.201
becoming is important, in Sahaj Yoga becoming is important,

00:11:20.493 --> 00:11:23.410
all other things are really of no use.

00:11:23.702 --> 00:11:27.785
You have to become, specially ladies are shy I think.

00:11:28.119 --> 00:11:31.201
They can do a lot and they should work it out,

00:11:31.493 --> 00:11:35.910
they are shy for nothing at all, what is the need to be shy?

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.702
They are very shy ladies and

00:11:38.994 --> 00:11:46.994
they just don't get into the whole working of  Sahaj Yoga,

00:11:47.285 --> 00:11:50.702
You should. If the ladies start talking about it,

00:11:50.994 --> 00:11:52.994
I think it will work much faster.

00:11:53.326 --> 00:11:56.785
And I bless you all to do this work,

00:11:56.994 --> 00:12:00.201
which was left half done by the Saints,

00:12:00.493 --> 00:12:03.702
it's your duty to complete it .

00:12:03.994 --> 00:12:05.493
May God Bless You.
