00:02.158 --> 00:05.243
Its very interesting the way you have found out

00:05.577 --> 00:09.577
today is the real Guru Purnima.

00:09.869 --> 00:14.577
The Purnima is the day when the moon is full.

00:14.869 --> 00:19.660
I knew this but for Sahaja Yogis we have to arrange

00:19.869 --> 00:23.952
Saturday, Sunday, Monday, Friday,Saturday, Sunday.

00:24.285 --> 00:29.160
Whenever it is, whether it is on that date or not, we have to arrange

00:29.368 --> 00:30.077
so it in that case,

00:30.285 --> 00:39.577
this time it was I think two days before So it doesn't matter,

00:39.869 --> 00:44.869
after all, moon is there for us and we are for moon,

00:45.160 --> 00:51.077
so it can't be some thing that would have very wrong in it.

00:58.785 --> 01:04.577
I have already told you such a lot about the Guru principle.

01:05.869 --> 01:07.869
And the guru principle,

01:08.077 --> 01:13.077
we have seen people who came on this Earth

01:13.285 --> 01:16.077
they were all mostly born realised

01:16.368 --> 01:20.660
actually, and they never gave realisation to anyone

01:20.869 --> 01:22.160
it's a very big difference.

01:22.493 --> 01:30.077
They were all born as realised souls and they  became Sufis

01:30.368 --> 01:33.077
and they are called by different names,

01:33.368 --> 01:39.285
but they were not given self realisation, they had it

01:39.577 --> 01:43.660
and because of their self realisation as they had,

01:43.869 --> 01:46.160
they have so much of knowledge

01:46.493 --> 01:50.785
and that is  what they try to impart to people.

01:52.997 --> 01:56.660
They knew all about Chakras everything they knew,

01:56.994 --> 02:03.660
somehow, must be in their past life achievements that they knew it,

02:03.994 --> 02:11.869
perhaps some of them were disciples of  other very great people.

02:12.201 --> 02:16.201
I don't know how they had full ideas to

02:18.493 --> 02:21.077
what is self realisation is

02:21.368 --> 02:25.702
what do we achieve after self realisation .

02:26.493 --> 02:30.785
Now the only person, I think, Mohammed Sahib, is the one

02:31.077 --> 02:36.493
who has talked about Miraj is the ascent

02:36.702 --> 02:41.077
Miraj is the ascent through our Kundalini.

02:41.493 --> 02:44.285
Of course in India they did talked about it,

02:44.577 --> 02:48.077
but in any other country they didn't say it so clearly

02:48.368 --> 02:50.785
that there is something called Miraj.

02:51.077 --> 02:54.493
And, not only that He talked of Miraj

02:54.785 --> 03:02.493
but also he talked of the resurrection time

03:02.785 --> 03:05.077
when your hands will speak.

03:05.410 --> 03:07.702
Two things He said,

03:07.910 --> 03:10.410
first that your hands will speak

03:10.702 --> 03:13.910
when you will get your realisation .

03:14.201 --> 03:18.493
It's a very great thing to say

03:18.785 --> 03:23.285
because that is how you can ascertain and you can be sure

03:23.577 --> 03:26.285
that you got your realisation.

03:26.577 --> 03:28.577
That's the sign He gave,

03:28.910 --> 03:32.410
and the second thing He talked about Miraj

03:32.702 --> 03:36.618
and the white horse He said was nothing  but the Kundalini,

03:36.785 --> 03:41.994
He didn't used the word Kundalini but He said it's a white horse.

03:42.285 --> 03:48.119
So He is the one who knew what should happen to the

03:48.285 --> 03:50.119
people when they got their self realisation.

03:50.285 --> 03:54.618
That's the great revelation to all of you

03:54.910 --> 03:58.618
and of such a help to Sahaja Yoga.

03:58.910 --> 04:01.201
You are all realised souls

04:01.493 --> 04:05.410
because you can feel the vibrations one thing,

04:05.702 --> 04:11.702
and secondly how you have become He explained it very clearly.

04:11.994 --> 04:16.119
We have so many saints in India, so many of them,

04:16.326 --> 04:20.493
one better than the other and whatever they talked,

04:20.702 --> 04:25.827
whatever they say, is so remarkableâ€¦ is so remarkable.

04:26.119 --> 04:33.326
But actually, human beings, I  think we are very dumb,

04:33.618 --> 04:37.994
that they never realised that we have so many saints here.

04:38.326 --> 04:42.827
Even in Turkey we had Sufis where it's a Sunni religion,

04:43.119 --> 04:46.119
there too, we had so many Sufis

04:46.410 --> 04:50.119
all over the world. We had realised souls,

04:50.410 --> 04:55.326
they were not incarnations, but they were born realised souls.

04:55.618 --> 05:02.535
So you see their explanation and everything is very good  because

05:02.702 --> 05:06.201
they were human beings and what ever they said

05:06.535 --> 05:12.035
was very much good for human beings to understand.

05:12.326 --> 05:14.410
Because an incarnation said something,

05:14.702 --> 05:16.535
it is something from the beyond

05:16.827 --> 05:20.535
and this new,

05:20.827 --> 05:26.618
I should say, advice of the people who were

05:26.910 --> 05:32.618
really human beings and had become realised souls and

05:32.827 --> 05:37.035
how they have talked about the various things is very remarkable.

05:37.326 --> 05:39.743
Firstly most of them were poets

05:40.035 --> 05:45.410
and this, we had Kabir in India,

05:45.743 --> 05:47.618
we don't know how he was born,

05:47.827 --> 05:50.827
where he was from, who were his parents,

05:51.119 --> 05:53.119
it's absolutely not known,

05:53.326 --> 05:58.910
despite that you can only make out from their poetry that

05:59.119 --> 06:01.827
he was the great great Sahaj Yogi,

06:02.119 --> 06:04.910
and how he have described things very interesting.

06:05.119 --> 06:10.535
He brought forth so many fundamental truths in his poetry

06:10.827 --> 06:12.618
and he talked about it.

06:12.952 --> 06:15.827
He didn't belong to any religion, as such,

06:16.119 --> 06:20.952
when he died there was a fight between Hindus and Muslims :

06:21.243 --> 06:25.451
what should we do with his body.

06:25.743 --> 06:30.743
And they say when they had lifted the sheet

06:31.119 --> 06:34.618
they found flowers, two types of flower one for Hindus

06:34.952 --> 06:39.535
and one for Muslims,

06:39.827 --> 06:41.952
so that's how he have solved the problems

06:42.119 --> 06:45.119
of this stupid fight people were having.

06:45.451 --> 06:51.618
In Sahaj Yoga we are not belonging to any such stupid religion,

06:51.952 --> 06:56.035
we belongs to one religion that is Vishwa Nirmal Dharma

06:56.326 --> 06:59.119
and all the stupidity of all these religions

06:59.326 --> 07:01.326
we should really throw away

07:01.660 --> 07:04.743
because, what you just see now today

07:05.035 --> 07:08.660
every where, every religious group is fighting each other,

07:08.952 --> 07:12.326
beating each other, finishing each other,

07:12.660 --> 07:17.952
is not the way a religious person should be like that

07:18.243 --> 07:19.660
but  they are killing each other.

07:19.952 --> 07:22.827
I mean, all kind of  horrible things they are doing,

07:23.119 --> 07:27.952
unbelievable how they can do that, such cruelty.

07:28.243 --> 07:32.451
And first thing is for a yogi,

07:32.660 --> 07:38.952
or for a saint, cruelty is  absolutely not  there,

07:39.243 --> 07:43.035
they will sacrifice their lives, they will do any thing,

07:43.451 --> 07:45.535
but they will not be cruel to any other person.

07:45.869 --> 07:50.451
Now, those who in the name of God and in the religion are cruel

07:50.743 --> 07:55.119
are actually not at all by  any chances religious people.

07:55.451 --> 07:59.535
So this is what the perversion of religion is,

07:59.869 --> 08:03.368
we all should understand, if we belong to Sahaj Yoga

08:03.660 --> 08:09.368
then for us kindness, sweetness, compassion and love

08:09.660 --> 08:11.869
is the main quality we should have

08:12.119 --> 08:17.077
and if  you don't have that, then we are not Sahaj Yogis.

08:17.368 --> 08:20.451
So we are a different clan,

08:20.743 --> 08:26.077
I should say, a  different personalities,

08:26.368 --> 08:27.451
who are really realised souls,

08:27.660 --> 08:32.869
who are above all these nonsensical ideas

08:33.160 --> 08:36.160
and who have vibrations.

08:36.451 --> 08:40.451
But, as I said, that now you must spread it

08:40.743 --> 08:42.869
because I have come on this Earth

08:43.077 --> 08:46.660
just for people to get their emancipation,

08:46.869 --> 08:48.952
get their realisation

08:49.285 --> 08:52.160
and unless and until all the people

08:52.368 --> 08:57.952
who believe in their emancipation get it, I won't be happy.

08:58.285 --> 08:59.785
There are many people who do believe

08:59.952 --> 09:03.577
but not yet got their realisation,

09:03.869 --> 09:06.785
so you have to work and you will be amazed

09:07.077 --> 09:10.577
you will find people who are very anxious to get their realisation.

09:10.869 --> 09:14.785
It will work out on this Guru Purnima day,

09:14.952 --> 09:16.577
it is a very auspicious day.

09:16.869 --> 09:20.368
I bless you with a special power

09:20.660 --> 09:23.077
that you can give realisation to other.

09:23.368 --> 09:26.077
Don't get involved in your own problems,

09:26.368 --> 09:29.577
that's not important, that will all be solved.

09:29.869 --> 09:34.869
Mostly what I got letters about is their own personal problems

09:35.160 --> 09:36.994
or some sort  of other problems.

09:37.285 --> 09:39.994
What you should do is to see what is your problem within you

09:40.285 --> 09:45.077
what is happening within you, why we are having a problem within,

09:45.493 --> 09:51.160
what is our duty, why we have got  our self realisation,

09:51.493 --> 09:55.368
why we   have got this wealth of spirituality

09:55.577 --> 09:57.869
and what should we do with it.

09:58.160 --> 10:02.077
I tell you really think about it every day,

10:02.368 --> 10:06.785
even for half an hour, you will realise that

10:07.077 --> 10:11.702
you are very well equipped people.

10:11.994 --> 10:16.201
Saints have done so much, they have written so many things

10:16.493 --> 10:18.702
they have fought the people, they did everything.

10:18.994 --> 10:20.577
You don't have to do anything like that,

10:20.869 --> 10:23.994
but one thing is that you must spread Sahaja Yoga.

10:25.285 --> 10:30.493
Even now Sahaj Yoga is not so much accepted everywhere,

10:30.785 --> 10:32.702
people don't know about it,

10:32.869 --> 10:36.577
it's surprising while all kinds of horrible gurus

10:36.785 --> 10:37.869
are very well known.

10:38.201 --> 10:41.577
So we have to do it by our behaviour,

10:41.910 --> 10:47.994
by our understanding, by our whole life, people should say

10:48.285 --> 10:51.910
that these are something rare people and different people.

10:52.201 --> 10:57.077
I am happy today is another day of Guru Purnima

10:57.285 --> 11:00.201
which is a very auspicious day

11:00.410 --> 11:05.410
and to be regarded as a very big blessing for you

11:05.577 --> 11:09.410
because this gives you, I mean this is a certificate,

11:09.577 --> 11:13.910
that you all are capable of being Gurus.

11:14.201 --> 11:15.785
You have to become that,

11:15.994 --> 11:20.201
becoming is important, in Sahaj Yoga becoming is important,

11:20.493 --> 11:23.410
all other things are really of no use.

11:23.702 --> 11:27.785
You have to become, specially ladies are shy I think.

11:28.119 --> 11:31.201
They can do a lot and they should work it out,

11:31.493 --> 11:35.910
they are shy for nothing at all, what is the need to be shy?

11:35.910 --> 11:38.702
They are very shy ladies and

11:38.994 --> 11:46.994
they just don't get into the whole working of  Sahaj Yoga,

11:47.285 --> 11:50.702
You should. If the ladies start talking about it,

11:50.994 --> 11:52.994
I think it will work much faster.

11:53.326 --> 11:56.785
And I bless you all to do this work,

11:56.994 --> 12:00.201
which was left half done by the Saints,

12:00.493 --> 12:03.702
it's your duty to complete it .

12:03.994 --> 12:05.493
May God Bless You.
