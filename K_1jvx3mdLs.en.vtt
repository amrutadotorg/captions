00:06:27.614 --> 00:06:32.323
Today we all have assembled here

00:06:37.948 --> 00:06:46.823
to pay our respect to Shri Ganesha.

00:06:54.989 --> 00:06:59.864
Ganapatipule has a special significance

00:07:06.489 --> 00:07:11.989
because He is Mahaganesha.

00:07:14.864 --> 00:07:17.989
The Ganesha at Mooladhara

00:07:19.406 --> 00:07:22.406
becomes Mahaganesha

00:07:23.614 --> 00:07:26.781
in the Virata, that is the brain.

00:07:29.031 --> 00:07:33.697
That means it is the seat of Shri Ganesha.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.781
That means Shri Ganesha governs

00:07:39.906 --> 00:07:49.406
from that seat the principle of innocence.

00:07:50.906 --> 00:07:56.031
As you know very well it is placed at the back

00:08:01.656 --> 00:08:05.240
in the region of optic thalamus,

00:08:05.572 --> 00:08:09.781
optic lobe as they call it,

00:08:13.531 --> 00:08:24.365
and it is the giver of innocence to the eyes.

00:08:31.115 --> 00:08:34.406
When He incarnated as Christ

00:08:34.697 --> 00:08:40.240
which is in here in the front, at Agnya

00:08:41.489 --> 00:08:44.739
He said very clearly that

00:08:44.739 --> 00:08:48.739
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.989
It's a very subtle saying,

00:08:54.864 --> 00:08:57.406
which people don't understand

00:08:58.447 --> 00:09:02.156
what is the meaning of the word "adultery."

00:09:04.365 --> 00:09:08.989
"Adultery" means "impurity" in a general word.

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:15.447
Any impurity in the eye "thou shalt not have"

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:19.156
it's very difficult.

00:09:19.531 --> 00:09:22.864
Instead of saying that you get your realization

00:09:22.864 --> 00:09:25.531
and clear your back Agnya,

00:09:26.406 --> 00:09:28.240
He has said it in a very short form,

00:09:28.531 --> 00:09:31.781
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:09:32.739 --> 00:09:37.323
And people thought, it's an impossible situation.

00:09:38.489 --> 00:09:41.156
Because He was not allowed to live long;

00:09:41.156 --> 00:09:43.948
actually His public life is limited

00:09:43.948 --> 00:09:46.198
to three-and-a-half years only.

00:09:49.906 --> 00:09:54.864
So whatever He has said has a very great significance,

00:09:55.156 --> 00:09:58.989
that your eyes should not be adulterous.

00:09:59.906 --> 00:10:04.031
When there is innocence there is no adultery:

00:10:05.531 --> 00:10:08.531
it means there's no impurity.

00:10:09.323 --> 00:10:11.406
For example, with our eyes

00:10:11.781 --> 00:10:19.531
we see something and we want to possess it.

00:10:20.531 --> 00:10:22.864
We start thinking.

00:10:23.739 --> 00:10:26.365
The thought starts

00:10:27.572 --> 00:10:30.365
like a chain, one after another.

00:10:30.864 --> 00:10:43.031
And then we get into the web of horrible thoughts,

00:10:44.656 --> 00:10:48.031
and then we become slaves of those thoughts.

00:10:48.531 --> 00:10:50.656
Without even our knowledge,

00:10:50.656 --> 00:10:54.115
our eyes are turned to things

00:10:57.156 --> 00:10:58.989
which are very gross

00:10:58.989 --> 00:11:01.406
and take you downward.

00:11:06.739 --> 00:11:10.989
As Shri Krishna has said that the Tree of Awareness

00:11:12.656 --> 00:11:16.031
grows upside-down,

00:11:16.531 --> 00:11:22.572
that the roots are in the brain

00:11:23.031 --> 00:11:26.031
and the branches grow downward.

00:11:26.031 --> 00:11:28.406
Those who have gone towards materialism

00:11:28.406 --> 00:11:30.531
have grown downward.

00:11:30.948 --> 00:11:35.323
Those who have gone towards Divine

00:11:35.323 --> 00:11:38.489
have grown upwards, towards the roots.

00:11:39.989 --> 00:11:43.198
The main root, as they call the taproot,

00:11:43.447 --> 00:11:51.073
the main root is innocence, is Shri Ganesha.

00:11:51.739 --> 00:11:56.739
And He becomes Mahaganesha in Ganapatipule.

00:11:58.405 --> 00:12:02.656
Here He's surrounded

00:12:03.489 --> 00:12:06.864
by the Father Principle, the Guru Principle

00:12:10.156 --> 00:12:20.281
of the sea, the ocean - the Indian Ocean.

00:12:26.073 --> 00:12:33.198
That is, here He becomes a Guru.

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:38.156
When a Sahaja yogi

00:12:39.031 --> 00:12:41.656
establishes his Shri Ganesha Principle,

00:12:41.656 --> 00:12:43.864
he's still a child.

00:12:47.948 --> 00:12:54.073
Of course his eyes start becoming purer and purer,

00:12:54.614 --> 00:12:58.323
and powerful and glistening.

00:13:00.031 --> 00:13:04.572
You must have seen when the kundalini gives you

00:13:05.906 --> 00:13:07.823
the realization

00:13:08.115 --> 00:13:14.489
then your eyes start gleaming,

00:13:14.989 --> 00:13:17.323
like a spark is there in the eyes,

00:13:17.531 --> 00:13:20.323
you can make out a spark.

00:13:22.281 --> 00:13:24.948
With ego it gets covered,

00:13:29.697 --> 00:13:38.489
with ego it blinds.

00:13:39.823 --> 00:13:45.323
With superego it is covered with tears.

00:13:48.531 --> 00:13:50.989
But when they are clear

00:13:51.489 --> 00:13:55.406
you see the beauty of the eyes,

00:14:00.864 --> 00:14:05.989
Shri Ganesha shining through your glances.

00:14:13.989 --> 00:14:17.281
The attention now starts flowing

00:14:17.531 --> 00:14:20.906
through the window of Shri Ganesha's temple.

00:14:24.614 --> 00:14:27.281
But when you mature,

00:14:31.156 --> 00:14:34.697
you become Mahaganesha.

00:14:36.156 --> 00:14:39.073
Then Mahaganesha is established in you

00:14:39.572 --> 00:14:43.323
and you become a satguru,

00:14:44.281 --> 00:14:48.823
you become a divine guru, you can teach others.

00:14:51.531 --> 00:14:54.323
Even a child could be that

00:14:55.031 --> 00:14:58.406
even a grown-up person may be stupid.

00:14:58.906 --> 00:15:07.198
It has nothing to do with age, color, creed or caste.

00:15:07.697 --> 00:15:13.365
It is a state to which one can reach at any time.

00:15:13.739 --> 00:15:16.864
Like we can say here we had Gyaneshwara,

00:15:17.115 --> 00:15:19.365
who at a very young age

00:15:23.447 --> 00:15:28.156
composed the great Gyaneshwari.

00:15:30.365 --> 00:15:31.823
As you have seen yesterday,

00:15:32.115 --> 00:15:34.781
at the age of twelve years Gorakhnath

00:15:35.739 --> 00:15:39.406
established his Mahaganesha.

00:15:44.447 --> 00:15:48.656
But if you do not try to ascend,

00:15:48.656 --> 00:15:50.864
then you'll remain at the same stage

00:15:50.864 --> 00:15:52.989
even when you grow old.

00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:58.031
So maturity is the indication.

00:15:58.781 --> 00:16:01.906
Here, as we see in Ganapatipule,

00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:08.323
Shri Ganesha is in its complete, matured form

00:16:12.739 --> 00:16:17.323
so that we develop also our Mahaganesha

00:16:17.323 --> 00:16:18.989
within ourselves,

00:16:19.906 --> 00:16:29.906
and our eyes become pure, powerful and divine.

00:16:37.406 --> 00:16:40.031
With proper working out,

00:16:41.864 --> 00:16:50.739
I am sure we can establish that state within ourselves.

00:16:54.489 --> 00:16:59.823
Today we came to Ganapatipule, it has a great significance,

00:17:00.405 --> 00:17:01.948
among the Asthavinayaka (eight Swayambhus of Shri Ganesha),

00:17:02.489 --> 00:17:05.447
It is the place of Mahaganesha.

00:17:07.489 --> 00:17:12.989
Mahaganesha is Pithadhish (Governor of all pithas)

00:17:15.365 --> 00:17:17.406
and sitting on this pitha,

00:17:20.656 --> 00:17:23.572
he protects all the Ganesha Swayambhus.

00:17:25.781 --> 00:17:28.281
He has the knowledge of all the Omkaras,

00:17:29.906 --> 00:17:34.405
as he has attained the Guru Tatwa (Guru Principle).

00:17:36.614 --> 00:17:40.115
If we see in the surroundings,

00:17:41.031 --> 00:17:43.115
the ocean, so beautiful and clean

00:17:43.989 --> 00:17:46.656
is washing the feet of this Ganapati,

00:17:48.156 --> 00:17:56.823
because the ocean represents the Guru Tatwa,

00:17:57.989 --> 00:18:03.156
and with that Guru Tatwa, he washes the feet of Shri Ganesha

00:18:06.405 --> 00:18:10.198
that is how it should happen with all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:11.572 --> 00:18:14.365
Ganesha Stuthi is done and then Shri Ganesha is established

00:18:15.115 --> 00:18:18.989
and thereafter with the Mahalaxmi Tatwa

00:18:22.405 --> 00:18:24.823
you have to become Mahaganeshas.

00:18:27.614 --> 00:18:31.281
This state can be achieved by children small and big,

00:18:32.198 --> 00:18:36.115
elderly people, ladies and everyone,

00:18:36.948 --> 00:18:43.531
if they can attain the straight forward behaviour,

00:18:44.614 --> 00:18:49.447
which we call as   Saralya  in Marathi, or they say Abhodita

00:18:50.073 --> 00:18:55.864
or innocence, when it is once imbibed in us,

00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:59.365
we can achieve the Guru Principle.

00:18:59.781 --> 00:19:04.697
Whichever Guru, who does not have this straight forward nature

00:19:04.823 --> 00:19:07.572
and innocence, he can never be a Guru,

00:19:07.781 --> 00:19:08.906
he is a Aguru (false Guru).

00:19:09.406 --> 00:19:13.365
The person, whose attention is always on the Divine Power,

00:19:14.365 --> 00:19:16.365
only he can become a real Guru.

00:19:20.031 --> 00:19:23.365
The attention of normal human beings is perverted,

00:19:24.406 --> 00:19:28.572
it is not clean. For this Christ has said,

00:19:29.031 --> 00:19:32.739
there should be no adultery in your eyes,

00:19:33.281 --> 00:19:37.989
means that if we put our attention on something,

00:19:38.656 --> 00:19:42.614
we start thinking a lot and strange thoughts come to our mind,

00:19:42.989 --> 00:19:44.614
as to how I can acquire this thing

00:19:44.864 --> 00:19:46.365
and why I did not get this thing,

00:19:46.572 --> 00:19:47.989
and other thoughts as to why and why not.

00:19:48.572 --> 00:19:51.115
If we see something and start thinking, then

00:19:51.697 --> 00:19:55.864
you have not yet crossed the Agnya Chakra.

00:19:57.405 --> 00:19:59.240
Whatever object you see, you should become thoughtless,

00:19:59.405 --> 00:20:05.447
especially in the heavenly abode of wealth and prosperity

00:20:05.656 --> 00:20:10.447
there are numerous Gods and Goddesses

00:20:10.697 --> 00:20:12.864
at least by seeing them, one should become thoughtless.

00:20:12.906 --> 00:20:14.323
Once we attain the state of thoughtless awareness,

00:20:14.656 --> 00:20:16.572
no perversion will remain in our attention any more.

00:20:16.697 --> 00:20:19.156
The thoughts perverting the mind will not come anymore,

00:20:19.739 --> 00:20:21.405
so how will perversion influence you.

00:20:23.656 --> 00:20:25.281
That means like Christ said,

00:20:25.365 --> 00:20:27.948
thou shall not have adulterous eyes.

00:20:28.323 --> 00:20:31.489
They should be so pure, like the rays of the sun,

00:20:31.864 --> 00:20:37.281
when they fall on trees, they do no absorb the dirt,

00:20:38.031 --> 00:20:42.656
they nourish and nurture them, not only that

00:20:43.073 --> 00:20:45.406
but they also give them strength.

00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:48.656
In a similar way,

00:20:48.948 --> 00:20:52.948
the Sahaja Yogis should have such radiance in their eyes, that

00:20:53.156 --> 00:21:01.531
they can create a very pure atmosphere in the whole world.

00:21:02.156 --> 00:21:06.323
Purity in the atmosphere is what we need today, everywhere,

00:21:07.323 --> 00:21:15.864
so that peace, joy and divine power can prevail in this world.

00:21:19.489 --> 00:21:23.406
Only singing the praise of Shri Ganesha may not be sufficient,

00:21:23.614 --> 00:21:25.614
Shri Ganesha needs to be awakened within us

00:21:26.156 --> 00:21:28.489
and he should evolve to the state of Mahaganesha.

00:21:29.073 --> 00:21:31.323
Only after attaining the state of Mahaganesha,

00:21:31.406 --> 00:21:35.240
can our country benefit and also through our country,

00:21:35.405 --> 00:21:37.406
other countries can benefit from this state.

00:21:37.531 --> 00:21:39.739
We are going to lead the others,

00:21:39.823 --> 00:21:45.156
but if we do not take up this responsibility,

00:21:45.614 --> 00:21:49.323
then I cannot say, what will happen of this whole world.

00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:52.614
I have a request to you all,

00:21:52.864 --> 00:21:55.697
to remove all the adultery in your eyes.

00:21:55.906 --> 00:22:01.115
For this we have the mantra of Nirvichara in Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:01.531 --> 00:22:03.115
Do not allow the thoughts to dominate you,

00:22:03.198 --> 00:22:05.156
if thoughts come, then say

00:22:05.656 --> 00:22:09.781
  Yen Neti Neti Vachane  (it doesn't exist)

00:22:10.281 --> 00:22:12.823
or say   Kshama Keli, Kshama Keli   (I forgive, I forgive),

00:22:13.281 --> 00:22:14.739
so that this thought is destroyed

00:22:14.823 --> 00:22:16.489
and once thoughtlessness is attained,

00:22:18.031 --> 00:22:22.240
then the perversion of the mind stops.

00:22:22.447 --> 00:22:24.906
Everybody should make an attempt,

00:22:25.115 --> 00:22:27.656
that your eyes are not adulterous.

00:22:27.906 --> 00:22:30.405
 "If there is perversion in the mind because of my eyes,

00:22:30.531 --> 00:22:34.739
then I do not want to have such eyes ", said Saint Tukaram,

00:22:34.989 --> 00:22:38.073
 "then, it is better to be blind ".

00:22:38.323 --> 00:22:43.572
In one way, it is better being blind,

00:22:43.656 --> 00:22:45.614
than have perversion in the mind.

00:22:45.739 --> 00:22:48.240
Rather have inner eyes to see Divinity.

00:22:48.281 --> 00:22:50.572
When these two principles come together properly,

00:22:51.115 --> 00:22:53.948
then one can say that

00:22:54.198 --> 00:22:56.365
the Sahaja Yogi has attained the Guru Principle.

00:22:57.281 --> 00:23:02.781
I bless you all, that here at Ganapatipule,

00:23:03.031 --> 00:23:07.281
the place of Mahaganesha, with his special grace,

00:23:07.697 --> 00:23:10.864
you all can attain your Guru Principle as soon as possible.

00:37:54.823 --> 00:38:00.989
First they will take the twenty-four names of Shri Vishnu,

00:38:01.406 --> 00:38:05.989
so that this Sushumna Nadi will open out.

00:38:06.323 --> 00:38:08.531
Then they will say the Shri Sukta,

00:38:08.823 --> 00:38:12.739
is the one to awaken the energy within you.

00:38:13.073 --> 00:38:19.531
Then they will say the 108 name of Mother Gauri.

00:38:21.156 --> 00:38:25.614
After that pujan, when this puja is over,

00:38:25.864 --> 00:38:29.073
then we will be doing a

00:38:37.198 --> 00:38:40.572
Eleven kundas we have got,

00:38:40.989 --> 00:38:47.323
and we'll be doing the havana on eleven kundas.

00:38:47.823 --> 00:38:52.989
Because the Mahaganesha is the ruler,

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:57.948
is the ruler of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:38:58.447 --> 00:39:00.656
So that has to be done with great devotion

00:39:00.656 --> 00:39:02.240
and dedication.

00:39:02.614 --> 00:39:06.281
I would suggest that first is finished this puja,

00:39:06.614 --> 00:39:08.281
you can have your food,

00:39:08.531 --> 00:39:12.739
and afterwards we'll sit down for the havan.
