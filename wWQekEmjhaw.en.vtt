Sahaja Yogini: … which is the point of evolution

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.720
for all of us.

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:11.720
And it gives great pleasure to Sahaja Yogis

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.240
to see so many other people

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.320
coming along to get their realization.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.520
Because the experience, once you achieve it,

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.600
makes you collectively conscious and puts you in touch,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.240
in a very real way, with the vibrations of other people

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.920
and with your own vibrations, of course

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.120
so that you're able to feel the exact condition of your subtle body,

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.840
and your spirit, and your chakras, which are these.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.360
these coloured circles here represent

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.680
the subtle transformers of energy that are placed within us

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.720
along the sympathetic nervous system.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.800
And in the centre there,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.240
between the yellow and blue lines,

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.520
is the area in which the Kundalini energy rises

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.480
when it's awakened by the presence of another being

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.080
who already has that awakened within him

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.440
and is emitting the vibrations

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.520
that are the same as the universal Kundalini energy.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.760
Kundalini in Christian terms is called the Holy Spirit,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.760
and it's the same energy that's described

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.760
in the New Testament as the “cool wind”.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.680
In Indian scriptures it's described as the Chaitanya,

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.280
as cool vibrations, and in Muslim scriptures it is called the Ruh,

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.680
and also described as cool vibrations.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.720
And these cool vibrations that you feel once

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.560
you receive the awakening

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.640
are the vibrations of absolute truth.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.720
Once you develop this awareness,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.000
you're able to ask any absolute question,

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.760
and, by holding your hands out, you can ask

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.520
if you're an atheist, you can ask the existence of God.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.000
And whether you get a cool or a warm vibration,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.080
you can tell whether what you're asking about is true or not true.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.320
So there's no need to use the intellect anymore

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.920
to try and work out things,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.880
because that's a limited sphere of activity;

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.560
but you actually, once you get your realization,

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.760
you go beyond mere thinking

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.840
into the unlimited, into the divine area.

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.840
I think …

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.440
it's a relief to be with people who are seeking their spirit,

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.560
who do have a desire to know the Divine

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.000
and to understand those …

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.000
things that in this society have almost become taboo subjects,

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.640
that there's so much emphasis around us, in our upbringing,

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:37.680
on material success, and competition, and …

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.880
doing better than everybody else in achieving things,

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.160
that the subtle things, that are much more important,

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:49.040
get pushed completely into the background.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.760
And sometimes we feel as if we are quite out of step with

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.560
everything, because we know that this is uneasy feeling

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.240
that there's something wrong with the world at the moment

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.160
but we can't put it right ourselves,

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.240
and it can be quite distressing.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.480
In my experience, once I actually

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.760
received my realization from Mother, two years ago in Melbourne

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.760
at a programme like this,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.440
I couldn't believe it that it had actually …

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.400
that I had found what I was looking for,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.680
without even quite knowing what it was that I was looking for.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.920
And …it's because

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.720
at first you try and understand you with your intellect,

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.320
and it doesn't seem to even make sense that …

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.080
and a lot of people, actually,

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:45.840
their self-esteem has been so damaged by their seeking,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.000
that it's hard to believe that you yourself could have

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.640
this quality within you, just waiting to be awakened.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.440
So, perhaps, before Mataji arrives,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.240
it would be good if you could just sit quietly and …

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:14.200
don't try and do anything.

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.760
If you've been in the habit of doing

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.280
particular types of meditation or techniques,

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.600
just try and put them aside and just have a completely open mind

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.240
about this experience because it is different,

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.680
although the terms may be familiar to you

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.840
from readings and teachings that you've had.

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:38.400
It's best to sort of try and approach it like a child,

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.120
with complete openness and freshness.

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.000
There's nothing frightening about the experience,

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.240
because it is, in fact,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.920
a gift of God to us.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:55.320
And God is Compassion and Love.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.600
And the vibrations that you feel once your Kundalini is awakened

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.760
are those vibrations that come from that Being.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.720
And there is nothing to be afraid of, although some books do say

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:12.840
that Kundalini awakening can be dangerous and so on.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.560
The people who've written those have experienced

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:18.680
something quite different.

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.000
But the actual experience should give you peace and joy,

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:26.080
which is absolute.

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:30.920
So, if you can just try and just be at peace now,

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.120
and quiet, and in your receptive frame of mind,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:39.400
and enjoy the experience when Mother comes.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:42.720
Thank you.

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.880
Sahaja Yogi: Again, ladies and gentlemen,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:04.920
it gives me a great pleasure, especially to the …

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.640
Shri Mataji: Thank you very much.

00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:23.000
SY: … especially to the people who have come for the first time.

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.760
There are many who couldn't come

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.800
either last evening or today to the workshop.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.720
To all of you, welcome.

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:34.800
Shri Mataji is here, for the first time in Perth, to

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:37.560
to grant Self-realization,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.680
not just on a one-to-one basis but to as many people

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:44.720
as desired from their heart.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.720
Many got it last night.

00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:52.400
Some came to the workshop today and experienced something more.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.240
All of you have to get it because this is the time

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:59.560
when the grace of God is overflowing, and …

00:07:59.840 --> 00:08:05.480
all of the true seekers of ages have to get their Self-realization.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:09.000
It's the reward of their seeking, it's the blessing

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.280
of their past births

00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:16.280
and all the seeking of God over the ages.

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.800
We've all probably been a Christian, we've all been a Jew,

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.800
we've all been a Muslim.

00:08:22.040 --> 00:08:24.440
We've been worshippers

00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:29.080
of God the Father and God the Mother

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:32.040
at many many times in history.

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.480
And so, now the time has come when we can get

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.320
that final step in our evolution,

00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:44.120
which is just to be triggered by an enlightened being

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:47.760
and which, once you get it,

00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.280
you can develop to that point

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:53.360
where you become totally one with God.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.160
This is the real yoga.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:59.120
Yoga, as you know, means union, oneness with God.

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.440
It's not exercises, it's not some discipline.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:08.080
It's the actualization of Self-realization.

00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:11.840
And so, without any further introduction by me,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.840
it gives me again great pleasure, ladies and gentlemen,

00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:20.920
to introduce to you Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:48.680
Shri Mataji: To all the seekers of truth and joy I bow.

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.400
It was really nice this morning

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.000
to meet some earnest seekers come down

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:02.000
to the place where I live

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:07.360
and to get their ultimate what they are seeking.

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:14.600
We have to know that God has created us with a purpose.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.800
He has worked for so many years,

00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:25.920
He has made us human beings with such care and love.

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:29.120
There has to be a purpose behind it.

00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:33.160
We also know that we have not yet found our purpose,

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.840
and that's why we are seeking.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.600
If we understand that,

00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:46.120
then one must know that something has to happen.

00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:48.840
God has to save His creation.

00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:54.040
And His greatest creation is a human being.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.680
This is what He has done out of all the creation —

00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:00.720
that you tried to evolve,

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.080
and that's how human beings are created.

00:11:05.400 --> 00:11:09.000
Only thing was, a human being was given a freedom

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:13.600
to choose between the right and the wrong for life.

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:18.920
It so happened that human being, in their error, naiveness —

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.800
I should say, in ignorance ,

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:24.760
did lots of mistakes. Doesn't matter.

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.880
Even if they have done,

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.320
most of them have come to right conclusion;

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:33.000
and that right conclusion,

00:11:33.200 --> 00:11:36.200
as I told you yesterday, sums up like this:

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.440
that whatever is going to happen to us further than this,

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:46.000
it has to be spontaneous, is a living process

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:48.760
that has made us human being, nothing dead.

00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.920
If the living process has to work it out,

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.400
then it has to be spontaneous.

00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.520
We cannot work it out.

00:11:56.720 --> 00:12:02.600
Secondly, that you cannot pay for it, or you cannot manoeuvre it.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:06.720
And thirdly, that you cannot put in any effort,

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.480
it has to be effortless.

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:13.240
If it is the most vital thing for God, it has to be effortless.

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:17.440
So that's how we reach certain conclusions:

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:23.080
that Self-realization, if it is the epitome of our evolution,

00:12:23.280 --> 00:12:28.400
it has to be absolutely freely given

00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.640
and has to happen in a very spontaneous way.

00:12:33.880 --> 00:12:36.280
Yesterday I explained to you in short

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.160
all the various types of ideas people have about Self-realization,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:46.640
and what we have to expect about Self-realization.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:50.760
We had another enquiry this morning about Kundalini,

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.240
that a gentleman asked Me a question saying

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:59.760
that he has read some books which are all the time warning

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.160
that Kundalini business is very difficult,

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:05.200
it comes up to a point but not

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.760
beyond a point, and all sorts of stories.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.160
And I have to tell you that that's not true.

00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.120
Kundalini is your own mother.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:19.920
You have your individual mother.

00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:23.720
And she is waiting all the time, all these years,

00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.800
just to give you your second birth.

00:13:27.040 --> 00:13:30.080
She never harms you, she never troubles you,

00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.560
she doesn't do anything of that kind.

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:37.720
It's … I don't know, the people who do not know how to do the thing

00:13:37.920 --> 00:13:42.160
or who have no authority must be doing all these kinds of tricks

00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:47.000
and must be suffering from Kundalini awakening.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.760
I know of one gentleman

00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.680
who, in Kashmir, said that he's got Kundalini awakening

00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:57.760
and he had tremendous heat and tremendous burning

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.920
and all sorts of things, and that …

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:05.760
he … “it's a very dangerous thing”, he has written a book on that,

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.880
some sort of a … I'm forgetting the name of the book.

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:14.360
Now, this gentleman himself is leading a very horrible life.

00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.680
Of that I've been able to find out.

00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:20.920
He has all sorts of relations, and he's leading

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:25.080
a very ridiculous life, not suitable for any saint.

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:28.840
If such a man has to have a Kundalini awakening …

00:14:29.080 --> 00:14:31.760
I can't understand how can Kundalini come to him,

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:36.600
but must be some sort of a God's anger on him

00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:41.080
that he has felt this kind of a feeling within him, maybe,

00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:44.880
or maybe he has been to somebody who is a wrong type of a person,

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:50.480
who has awakened the Kundalini

00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:53.120
without any authority.

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:56.520
And maybe, that time, the first deity, as I told you

00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.840
is it there? the chart is not there?

00:14:59.080 --> 00:15:02.040
the first deity I told you

00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:08.080
did not like it and got angry.

00:15:08.280 --> 00:15:11.240
And the whole sympathetic nervous system on the left-hand side

00:15:11.440 --> 00:15:14.440
and right-hand side got angry.

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:18.400
And when that happen, the person can develop lot of heat

00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:21.600
and lot of blisters.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.240
I have seen a person getting a blister all over,

00:15:24.440 --> 00:15:27.360
all round his neck.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:29.440
At the very outset I must tell you

00:15:29.680 --> 00:15:35.560
that heat is the sign of

00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.440
violent action.

00:15:41.680 --> 00:15:44.760
Say, for example, if you heat the helium gas,

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.760
the molecules of the helium gas start going all round.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.920
They are very volatile, they start moving in a way

00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:59.040
that you feel that two armies are fighting.

00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.400
Then you find that ten armies are fighting,

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.000
then you find all of them are fighting with each other.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.760
But if you cool it down, their action is very collective;

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:11.640
they move in a smooth manner, in a very collective manner.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.040
So, one can see that when we are heated up also ,

00:16:16.240 --> 00:16:18.360
you see, a man is very hot-tempered

00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:24.760
means he is a very … angry person,

00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.680
and he cannot carry on with others, he has no patience.

00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:32.320
But when we see that a person is cool, is collected,

00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:34.560
then we say he is a nice person.

00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.760
In the same way, if you feel heat from your Kundalini,

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:43.120
then be sure that something is wrong that is resisting you.

00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:45.760
Even while giving realization in the beginning,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.600
you do feel little heat because the heat of the body has to go out.

00:16:49.800 --> 00:16:53.280
But today I'm going to tell you more about,

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:56.280
particularly more about the chakras

00:16:56.480 --> 00:17:00.320
and not about the general things that I told you last time.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.320
In any case, you can get the book,

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.280
and you can come to our centres and clarify it more and more.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.320
But, as much as possible, today I will try

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:11.320
to tell you about the chakras,

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:15.760
how we spoil them,

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.760
and what are the effects of these subtle chakras,

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.840
which look after our gross plexuses within our body.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.120
Please be seated.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.080
Now, the first chakra, as I told you,

00:17:35.280 --> 00:17:37.240
is called as the Mooladhara Chakra.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:40.480
I'm sorry.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.680
(Aside) Is it all right now? Can you see it?

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.120
Sahaja Yogi: Just raise it slightly [unclear].

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:48.440
Shri Mataji: You can't hear? All right.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.680
Now, this is the first centre, which is a subtle centre within us.

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:57.640
Now, this centre is manifesting outside

00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.080
what you call the pelvic plexus.

00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.520
The pelvic plexus is responsible for all our excretions.

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.920
Whether you like it or not, it is there, it is present within us,

00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:17.040
and it looks after all our excretory …

00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:20.880
functions.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:26.600
It is important to see

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.400
that this chakra is placed under the Kundalini.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:32.760
So, when the Kundalini rises …

00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.600
the Kundalini is the power within you,

00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:42.440
the pure power of desire,

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:47.200
the desire that you want to become one with the Divine.

00:18:47.400 --> 00:18:50.600
Now, it lies below,

00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:54.520
this chakra lies below, is a very important point —

00:18:54.720 --> 00:19:00.280
that this chakra does not play any part

00:19:00.520 --> 00:19:02.720
in the ascent of the Kundalini,

00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:06.480
because Kundalini doesn't pierce through it.

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:10.160
On the contrary, if this chakra is pure,

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:15.360
the information about somebody who can raise your Kundalini

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.760
can be easily communicated through this chakra.

00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.200
But it does not

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.600
play any part in our evolution.

00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.320
That means sex does not play part in our evolution.

00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:37.440
Animals know what is sex is, human beings know what sex is.

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.600
Sex is a part very natural within us,

00:19:41.800 --> 00:19:46.760
and for our ascent the sex does not play any part.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.360
At the time when the Kundalini is rising …

00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:55.120
the Kundalini who is the mother of the deity of this centre,

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.840
this Kundalini is the Virgin,

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:03.120
so He is looking after the protocol of the Virgin.

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:07.040
And this Kundalini, when She has to rise,

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.880
if you have by any chance

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.280
something wrong with this chakra,

00:20:13.480 --> 00:20:16.640
then it takes time for Kundalini to rise.

00:20:16.840 --> 00:20:19.160
Because this centre

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.320
has to give permission or, you can say, the sanction

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:25.880
that it's all right and that Kundalini can rise.

00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:28.080
So this is the sustaining force,

00:20:28.280 --> 00:20:31.760
or is the centre of the Kundalini itself.

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:34.240
Now, the word “mooladhara” means

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:39.280
“the one who is the support of

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.920
the … moola is what? … moola is …

00:20:45.400 --> 00:20:46.680
of the root”.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.320
The root is the Kundalini.

00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.120
And it resides in that area, that is called as Mooladhara,

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:55.800
while the centre is down,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:59.160
and the centre is called as Mooladhara Chakra.

00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:02.760
That's how we have these two things separate.

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.160
Now, this centre is important because it gives sustenance,

00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.000
it looks after the protocol of your Kundalini.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:14.520
So anybody who says that you can ascend through sex,

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:18.160
please be sure you are misled by that.

00:21:18.360 --> 00:21:20.360
I do not want to mislead you.

00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:22.920
I want you to have your Self-realization.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.800
Because you are people who are seekers ,not today,

00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:28.880
you have been seekers for ages.

00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.520
And no use running after something

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:35.360
because it appeals to your weaknesses, or because it supports

00:21:35.560 --> 00:21:38.560
some sort of a thing which you heard before, like Freud.

00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:42.640
Now what Freud has said is absolutely wrong.

00:21:42.840 --> 00:21:46.360
Because what he has achieved today you can see very clearly

00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:50.480
that all the societies in the West are finished.

00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:54.480
This is thanks to the unholy trinity. One of them was Mr. Freud.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.400
And when I said this in Austria, people were very happy.

00:21:58.640 --> 00:22:00.760
Because they were feeling guilty that it is Freud

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:02.440
whom they supported always,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.120
and what he has done, he's played a mess with everybody's life.

00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:08.320
He just knew one side of life,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.920
that one side which starts from the sex, goes upward.

00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.880
That's only the desire.

00:22:14.120 --> 00:22:17.760
That's only the desire power, but he did not know the other side.

00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.760
When he talked that you should not be conditioned at all,

00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.080
he did not know that if you do not condition yourself,

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:27.040
then there is another side which is much more dangerous,

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.760
and that is the side of ego.

00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:34.760
This is what exactly Hitler did.

00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:38.840
He used his ego. And with his ego what he has done.

00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:40.720
And so many such people,

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.120
who are thinking there's nothing like conditioning ,

00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.760
“What's wrong? What's wrong?”  and what they achieved is nothing

00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:53.280
but a very bumptious, useless ego, which cannot see the truth.

00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.800
Anybody who pampers that ego, they run after it.

00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.120
And they say, “This is your name,” big name they give you,

00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:02.640
or they tell you, “Oh, you just do this,

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:06.280
you look like this, you wear this, you do this.”

00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:09.760
You get quite satisfied with it. You have to be honest.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.440
If you are not honest to it, how will you get your realization?

00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:15.760
You have to be honest. To get your realization

00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.560
you have to be a human being, first and last.

00:23:18.800 --> 00:23:21.720
If you are not a human being, you are just trying

00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:25.560
to do something which is so outside.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.080
It is all outside. If you are doing something outside,

00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:32.280
you cannot get it inside. It has to happen inside.

00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.600
I feel concerned because you people

00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:40.640
are realized persons if you take to reality.

00:23:40.840 --> 00:23:43.720
But if you don't take to it, what's going to happen to you?

00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.600
Because you are seekers. You are not like mundane, ordinary people,

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:50.320
who are not seeking, who are just seeking money or position

00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.000
or things. You are special people.

00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.920
You are people of God, who have to become prophets,

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:58.080
and you must have powers to make others prophets,

00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.840
as William Blake has said about hundred years back.

00:24:02.120 --> 00:24:05.800
You are that type of people. And you should not waste your energy,

00:24:06.040 --> 00:24:08.760
believing into things which is not true.

00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:11.280
Is not true, because, you see, the Kundalini

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:16.000
is placed above that point which we call as sex.

00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:19.520
We are not sex points! To reduce ourselves to sex points

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:23.200
is the minimum, I mean, I'd say, the most degrading thing

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.840
that can happen to human beings.

00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:29.760
We are the highest type of creation of God.

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.760
Sex, everybody has, you know even earthworms have,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:36.040
every sort of nonsense has sex. What's so great about sex?

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:41.200
There is so much we talk about sex as if we are impotent people.

00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.240
There is nothing in sex that can give you your realization.

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:48.640
Of course, you have to lead a sanity,

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.800
you have to understand a life of sanity

00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:54.680
and lead a life of understanding about sex.

00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.920
Sahaja Yoga is never against sex,

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.600
we believe in sensible marriages,

00:24:59.800 --> 00:25:03.560
bringing up children who are very realized souls

00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:06.920
to be born on this earth. That is the thing we have to achieve.

00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:10.280
There are so many great people who want to be born.

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:12.640
But the people who are going to give them birth

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:17.160
are lost into nonsensical things, they are just lost.

00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.920
They have no idea as to the whole,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.840
what part, what role they have to play into it,

00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:27.120
and just they get lost in their individual understanding of a thing.

00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:28.320
It is not that.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:31.880
You have to understand it's a very cosmic thing that's happening,

00:25:32.120 --> 00:25:35.400
and thousands and thousands and thousands of people

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:38.640
have to get their realization. That's the main thing.

00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:41.640
If you don't get your realization, I must say

00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.760
the age-old desire of yours is lost for ever.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.200
So don't fix your mind into some idea which somebody

00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:52.560
has screwed into your head because thousands are running after it.

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:58.520
Maybe that reality cannot have thousands, maybe.

00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.800
Millions we can't have, I know that. Reality is not easy to accept.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:05.280
Never people accepted reality so far.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.440
When Christ came in, how they behaved?

00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:10.760
When Buddha came in, how they behaved? Nobody does that way.

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.360
It's a  you see, it's not a hoard that's walking towards it,

00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:17.160
it's not a shoals of fishes walking towards it,

00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:19.560
it's not a big mob walking towards it.

00:26:19.760 --> 00:26:23.800
It's every person who has to receive the realization.

00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:26.760
And you have to pay full attention to it.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.280
You have to respect yourself, and know that you are a seeker.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.360
And, as a seeker, you all must get your realization.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.480
Otherwise you have no meaning, no purpose, nothing.

00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.760
And if you join any purposeless pursuit,

00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:43.280
I would say I have told with all earnestness

00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:46.240
and with all My love, but if you don't want to understand it,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.840
nobody can force your realization into you.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.360
So please understand that first thing is to get your realization.

00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:57.280
If you can't get your realization,

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.760
then you have lost the biggest chance of your life.

00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.760
You all have to become your spirit, your Self.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.320
And this is the great instrument God has created within you.

00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:13.920
As I told you yesterday, this is the knowledge of the roots,

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:15.560
of the roots within us.

00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.680
And this knowledge you have to understand first of all,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:21.600
you need not accept it, but you should not deny.

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.040
With open mind, listen to Me

00:27:24.280 --> 00:27:27.160
what happens, and how these chakras are within us,

00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:30.280
and how they react, and how we falter.

00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:32.640
So one of the first things I have to tell you

00:27:32.840 --> 00:27:36.200
that sex plays no part in Kundalini ascent

00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:39.200
as far as its piercing is concerned,

00:27:39.400 --> 00:27:43.440
means it does not have to pass through that.

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.720
Whatever is the truth, I have to tell you.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.640
You may not like it, but I have to tell you.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.600
I am not here to seek votes

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:52.400
or to have elections or to collect money out of you.

00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:55.440
I don't want to buy Rolls-Royces. Nothing of the kind.

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:58.320
I am here to give you what you have, what is your own.

00:27:58.520 --> 00:28:00.240
I am just here to give you that,

00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:02.680
what is your own, what is your own property.

00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:07.080
So it does not matter also if you do not like it for the time being.

00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:08.600
But ultimately you'll like

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:11.760
because you will know Mother has told us the truth.

00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.080
Now, the second chakra, Swadhishthana,

00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:16.760
is also a very important chakra within us.

00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.240
This Swadhishthana Chakra

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.480
plays a very very important part in our lives,

00:28:22.680 --> 00:28:24.600
when in the modern times specially.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:29.080
Because this is the centre we use for planning,

00:28:29.280 --> 00:28:31.800
thinking, for all futuristic life,

00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.920
as well as doing every sort of physical work.

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.560
This centre is the one that creates balances as well as imbalances.

00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:43.920
If you use this centre in a wrong way,

00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:48.760
you create an imbalance within you, of a very very serious nature.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.200
For example, this centre, Swadhishthana,

00:28:51.400 --> 00:28:55.480
looks after your aortic plexus in the gross.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:58.080
Aortic plexus doctors know what it is.

00:28:58.280 --> 00:29:00.400
But this centre is a subtle centre

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:06.520
placed in the medulla oblongata inside the spinal cord.

00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:10.640
Now, with this centre, we think about the future,

00:29:10.840 --> 00:29:13.560
or we can think about the past.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:17.520
We put in physical work also through this centre.

00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:20.840
So it moves to the right as well as to the left.

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.480
It is dangling in the air. It's the only centre

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.400
which moves on both the sides in such a big periphery, all round.

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:32.320
And it can also retract and can go further within.

00:29:32.520 --> 00:29:36.320
Now, when we have an imbalance in this,

00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:40.280
we really do not realize that we are leading an imbalanced life,

00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:43.280
till we get into a serious trouble.

00:29:43.480 --> 00:29:48.520
This centre has got to look after your liver, your kidney,

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:52.680
your spleen, your pancreas,

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.120
and your uterus.

00:29:55.320 --> 00:29:57.520
Plus it has a very important work:

00:29:57.720 --> 00:30:02.320
that when you think too much, the brains cells are used up —

00:30:02.560 --> 00:30:06.200
to replace the brain cells from the fat cells from the stomach.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.040
It transforms the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:13.080
And this is a very important work it has to do.

00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.320
(Aside) Can you put on this one please? Yes.

00:30:16.640 --> 00:30:22.040
Now, when this chakra

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:25.520
works more for thinking, for planning, this, that,

00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:29.520
it is … it neglects its other work,

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.400
which is also equally important, like liver, and your pancreas,

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:37.560
and your kidneys, your spleen.

00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:43.440
And thus we develop diseases of liver, of all these organs.

00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:48.240
Out of this, liver trouble comes to us because of our overactivity;

00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.760
also it can come to us from inactivity of the liver.

00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:58.400
It can come to us from both the types of liver.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.440
Now, if you have an active liver, a very active liver,

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.720
you develop a funny disease , we call it as biliousness.

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:09.160
Your attention is always unhappy,

00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:11.760
and you feel like vomiting all the time.

00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.840
You you get very irritable, and you have a temperament

00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:19.760
that you don't feel the peace within yourself.

00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:24.200
This is one. That means your attention gets absolutely disturbed.

00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:29.280
Because the liver is the one that really sustains your attention.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.160
So when your liver is out, your attention is funny,

00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:34.240
you don't know what to do with your attention,

00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:36.440
and all the time you feel, “Oh, it's terrible,”

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:42.120
and you feel very nervous, and agitated and anxious.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.720
But then doctors do not know at that stage, I think,

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.120
it's liver, which is bad.

00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.080
So, what they do is to use the …

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.240
something to find out about liver, what's wrong with the liver.

00:31:57.440 --> 00:32:02.400
But when they try to do that, it's not so easy to find out,

00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:05.400
till you find the patient is lying

00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.400
just on the death bed with the cirrhosis of the liver.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:11.360
And then they certify, “Now you are going to die.”

00:32:11.680 --> 00:32:13.680
But in Sahaja Yoga, if you have a liver,

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:17.640
at the very outset you can make it out that you have got a liver.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:19.880
Because, as you know, on the fingers

00:32:20.120 --> 00:32:22.400
it can be felt where the liver is,

00:32:22.640 --> 00:32:26.040
and if you see that this Swadhishthana Chakra is catching,

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:28.440
with this centre of Nabhi Chakra,

00:32:28.640 --> 00:32:31.400
then it means you have a bad liver.

00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:33.880
And this liver is a very serious thing

00:32:34.120 --> 00:32:38.080
because it makes a personality absolutely useless

00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:41.480
for any communication after some time.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.840
Now, the another thing is the neglect

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.680
of other centres, like, say, your spleen.

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.520
Now, this is a very serious thing.

00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:53.160
Because if you are very hectic by temperament,

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:55.880
and if you are all the time thinking of future: “I have to go,

00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:59.120
I have to attend the office, I have to do this, I have to do that”

00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.360
that time this centre,

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:06.040
which is called as the , we call it the left Nabhi centre,

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:07.360
gets excited.

00:33:07.560 --> 00:33:11.760
And it hasn't got that  we should say, the

00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:15.000
it hasn't got that attention that it requires,

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:20.200
so it becomes very hectic itself. It goes into an emergency.

00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:23.200
All the time attending to an emergency, it is producing

00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:27.840
more more red blood corpuscles, and you become absolutely hectic.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:30.320
For example, people in the morning read the newspaper.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:33.760
First shock comes to them from the newspaper, somebody died,

00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:36.760
something happened, something horrible things happened.

00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.400
Naturally, the poor spleen goes into action,

00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:42.880
and it starts producing red blood corpuscles.

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.280
That time you are having your breakfast, for example,

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:48.760
so all swadhisthan emergency. Then you are suddenly rushing out.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.200
On the way you see lot of this traffic,

00:33:51.400 --> 00:33:53.200
and you have to catch up with the time and all that.

00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:57.080
All this modern life makes you that hectic,

00:33:57.280 --> 00:34:01.520
nervous, hasty, we can say, and a speedy person.

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:05.240
This speed , actually the speedometer is your spleen.

00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:10.160
So poor spleen goes into a bizarre state.

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:13.240
It cannot control your speed,

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.920
and it has to , it tries to keep the speed with you,

00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:19.000
your hectic nature. It becomes hectic itself.

00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.800
And then a disease

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.680
which we call as leukemia, the blood cancer, can develop.

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:29.800
Blood cancer is the result of this kind of temperament and nature.

00:34:30.040 --> 00:34:33.000
Now, there are many children who get blood cancer. I have seen,

00:34:33.200 --> 00:34:36.280
I have seen many children suffering from blood cancer.

00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.160
And these children get it from the parents

00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:41.480
who are like this, hectic parents,

00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:44.920
who are anxious: “We must go to the office, we must do this,

00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:48.080
we must get that” so many things at the same time.

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.480
And such people get this trouble called leukemia,

00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:54.680
and is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:54.920 --> 00:34:57.680
It is absolutely curable through Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:02.480
It's not difficult to cure leukemia, but you have to continue with,

00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:05.160
you have to continue with the practices of Sahaja Yoga,

00:35:05.360 --> 00:35:07.520
so that you absolutely get cured,

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:11.560
and then you can cure the leukemia of other people.

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:15.200
Another thing that can happen to you is the kidney trouble.

00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.600
You see, the kidney becomes overactive.

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.200
The activity of the kidney ,too much ,

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.800
creates a problem within us which we call as hypertension,

00:35:24.040 --> 00:35:26.880
by which we get high blood pressures and things like that.

00:35:27.160 --> 00:35:29.840
People always tell, “I suffer from high blood pressure.”

00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.920
Dr. Warren himself, when he came to Me,

00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:35.080
was a patient of high blood pressure and many other problems.

00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.320
But after Sahaja Yoga, you settle down.

00:35:38.560 --> 00:35:41.080
You find you strike the balance.

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:44.360
You strike the balance because you don't think so much.

00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:47.680
The thinking that goes on like mad stops.

00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:50.120
If you want to think, you can think.

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:52.120
If you don't want to think, you just don't think.

00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.080
You can stop it and sleep.

00:35:54.280 --> 00:35:56.560
But if you want to think, you can think it.

00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:59.680
But I've met a doctor in Geneva who came to Me, he said,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:02.760
“Mother, cut my throat, do what you like, but stop this thinking.”

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.080
You see, it's so disgusting for some people

00:36:06.280 --> 00:36:08.640
that even if I don't want to think, this brain goes on

00:36:08.840 --> 00:36:10.200
chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck-chuck, like that,

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.280
troubling me so much.

00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:15.200
But it is because of this centre, which has got out of its balance,

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.360
and it does not know how to control,

00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:19.440
and that's why these things happen.

00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:25.320
Then, your uterus also, women who think too much also can become,

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:27.600
they may not produce any children.

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:30.240
It's possible that they can become barren women

00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:33.560
because there's no nourishment to that uterus,

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:36.440
and maybe they might develop troubles of the uterus.

00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:40.760
All these troubles come from this overthinking,

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.840
futuristic attitude, speediness in life.

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:46.040
One of them is diabetes.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.320
Now, diabetes will not occur

00:36:49.520 --> 00:36:52.600
to any ordinary farmer who doesn't think so much.

00:36:52.840 --> 00:36:56.640
But it will always happen to a man who's thinking about a big plan

00:36:56.840 --> 00:37:00.880
of how to project himself, his business plan, or his other plans.

00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.640
All such people get diabetes.

00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:06.560
The reason is he thinks so much that there's no attention left

00:37:06.760 --> 00:37:10.440
to that poor pancreas, and the pancreas gets sick,

00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:14.000
and that's how he gets this disease of diabetes,

00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:16.920
which is supposed to be incurable. Not in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:17.160 --> 00:37:20.280
In Sahaja Yoga diabetes is absolutely curable.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:22.760
Jaundice and all these diseases of the liver

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.760
are also absolutely curable in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:29.280
By giving the balance to the people you can achieve a lot.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:32.000
Because this is what all the prophets told us,

00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.120
that we should lead a life of moderation,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.400
not to go to extremes.

00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:42.360
If you go to extremes, then you are not dharmic,

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:44.320
means you are not sustenant,

00:37:44.520 --> 00:37:46.680
you are not sustaining yourself properly.

00:37:46.880 --> 00:37:52.760
Now, these are ten valencies within us, in the human beings.

00:37:53.080 --> 00:37:55.680
In the carbon, there are four valencies, as you know.

00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:59.280
In every element there are eight valencies,

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:05.200
and these valencies become ten valencies in the human beings.

00:38:05.400 --> 00:38:08.160
Now, these are the ten dharmas, as they call it,

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:11.080
or the ten kind of behaviour,

00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:14.440
or ten kind of sustenance we have to look after.

00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.760
If we do not keep that balance of these ten things,

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.880
then we go off the balance. Like Buddha has told you

00:38:22.120 --> 00:38:24.440
that you have to keep to the central path of ascent.

00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.280
And that's what exactly it is

00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:29.320
that we have to keep to the central path of ascent,

00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:32.040
and if we cannot keep to the central path of ascent,

00:38:32.240 --> 00:38:36.440
then we suffer from, first of all, the physical problem.

00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:39.320
First of all we suffer from the physical problem,

00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:42.600
and then we suffer also from mental problem

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:44.720
because we go into an imbalance.

00:38:44.920 --> 00:38:47.000
Now, when this chakra moves to the left side,

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:49.920
we get into mental problems.

00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.840
Because when it goes to the left side, what happens is

00:38:53.120 --> 00:38:58.920
that we start using things like for our emotional behaviour

00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:02.040
and emotional expressions, and too much of it.

00:39:02.240 --> 00:39:05.200
As a result of that, what happens to us

00:39:05.400 --> 00:39:09.320
that we become possessed by another force,

00:39:09.520 --> 00:39:11.560
that resides beyond this centre.

00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:15.520
And beyond this centre resides the collective subconscious.

00:39:15.720 --> 00:39:18.680
Now, this collective subconscious is a very dangerous area

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:20.400
where people should not enter.

00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:23.240
Any person who says, “I am very devoted,

00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.080
I am very dedicated, I must do this”

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:29.640
without getting connection with the God, if you do all these things,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.440
your whole attention can be ruined.

00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.680
For example, supposing there's , there's a telephone,

00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:38.120
and you are not connected,

00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.040
and you are using the telephone very fast, then what will happen?

00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.640
The telephone will go out of order, and you will have no connection.

00:39:44.880 --> 00:39:49.320
In the same way, the people who very earnestly try to do something

00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:53.120
without having connection with God move to the left side,

00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:55.840
which is called as the collective subconscious area.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.920
And this is a very very dangerous area within us.

00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.440
From there, many things ,

00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.480
which the doctors call as protein 58,

00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:09.480
but we call them as dead souls attacking.

00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.400
Doctors call it as protein 58

00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.080
because they don't now what they are.

00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:18.040
But they say that these proteins come from the area

00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.280
which is unknown

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:24.800
but existed within us since the day of creation.

00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:26.920
That means it is collective subconscious.

00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.680
And these proteins, like 52 and proteins 58,

00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:32.440
they have tried to even photograph.

00:40:32.680 --> 00:40:34.480
And they said that when they attack us,

00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:39.680
then only cancer is triggered.

00:40:39.880 --> 00:40:42.760
But the vulnerable position of the cancer

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.400
is created by our extreme behaviour.

00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:49.920
Now how cancer is created, we should try to understand.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.400
For example, the left side and the right side

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.160
as I told you, there are two powers, left and right-side powers,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:59.080
which we work out, for example, the emotional on the left,

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:01.840
and, on the right-hand side, we have a power

00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.040
which we call as the power of action,

00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.680
where your physical and your mental efforts are expressed.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.840
Now, when you go to the extreme of this, then

00:41:14.080 --> 00:41:17.040
what happens the connection between the left and right breaks.

00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.760
Just breaks. And when it breaks,

00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.760
you start getting the power on its own

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.680
because it breaks the connection with the whole.

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:30.040
So, it is very arbitrary, it is not coordinated.

00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.480
It doesn't cooperate with the whole body,

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:34.520
it just starts growing by itself.

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.760
And one cell becomes big, or cells in the nose

00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:40.760
start becoming big and start covering the whole face.

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:45.160
There's no relationship between the different organs

00:41:45.360 --> 00:41:49.560
and different parts of the face.

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:54.360
It just starts growing, overpowering other , other cells,

00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:58.720
and that's how we call it a malignant growth, or malignant cell.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:02.400
Now, when you go on like that, what happens it breaks.

00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:05.480
And the deity  the one which controls it,

00:42:05.680 --> 00:42:09.920
the one which is inside it just sleeps off.

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:13.880
At that time, the best thing would be to awaken the deity.

00:42:14.120 --> 00:42:17.200
If you can awaken the deity, the whole thing comes back,

00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:20.320
and that's how we can cure the cancer of people.

00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.200
It's true, Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer. I have been telling this

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:27.800
for the last, I don't know, twelve years or so,

00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:30.880
that it's only through Sahaja Yoga cancer will be cured.

00:42:31.120 --> 00:42:34.760
Now we have many doctors who are doing cancer research and all that.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.120
And we have one doctor, Shivardhan,

00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:40.080
who is doing a research now on cancer,

00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:43.920
and he has accepted this, that it is only Sahaja Yoga

00:42:44.160 --> 00:42:46.800
will cure cancer, otherwise nothing can cure it,

00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:49.640
because when human beings go to the extremes,

00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.120
to the right or to the left, they do this to themselves,

00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:58.560
and they are vulnerable to be triggered by some sort of a protein

00:42:58.760 --> 00:43:02.760
which enters into your being and triggers this cancer.

00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.040
That's why doctors can remove your nose, they can remove your ears,

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.120
they can remove this, they can remove that.

00:43:08.320 --> 00:43:10.640
But they can't remove the base of cancer,

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:14.080
and the base of cancer is the centre, the subtle centre.

00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:17.240
And to attack that subtle centre,

00:43:17.440 --> 00:43:20.040
one has to become a subtle person.

00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.760
The doctors have to become self-realized, so that they can attack.

00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:26.000
Now, in Sahaja Yoga we have many doctors,

00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:30.600
and some are Russians, some are English, some are Indians,

00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:32.800
and they are all working it out together.

00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:35.640
And maybe that we may be able to publish a book

00:43:35.840 --> 00:43:39.160
on how to cure cancer with Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:42.240
or how we have cured cancer with Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:48.200
But the main thing is that we are not here to cure people,

00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:51.040
not to give cure to everyone,

00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:53.280
every Dick, Tom and Harry, as you can say,

00:43:53.520 --> 00:43:55.760
but we are here to give you realization.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:01.840
God's interest is in people who are who are seeking God,

00:44:02.600 --> 00:44:05.560
who are God's people. He is not interested in devils.

00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.040
Supposing tomorrow Hitler gets cancer

00:44:09.240 --> 00:44:11.120
God won't be interested in curing him.

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:15.480
So God's interest is mainly in people who are seeking Him

00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:18.120
and those who get enlightenment,

00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:21.640
and after their enlightenment they can give light to others.

00:44:21.880 --> 00:44:24.680
God doesn't bother about people who are just wasteful,

00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:27.800
who are good for nothing. He has to look after the people

00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.480
who really will take up the cause of God

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:34.080
and do His work after getting cured.

00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:37.880
Now, we had a patient today, this morning, who came to us,

00:44:38.120 --> 00:44:41.800
who went to some horrible guru and who paid a lot of money,

00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:46.440
to get epilepsy and then a brain cancer.

00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.720
Now, with Sahaja Yoga, he's very much cured. He is walking about.

00:44:49.920 --> 00:44:51.400
Of course, doctors had given up hope,

00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:53.120
they had prepared for his death and all that.

00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:56.760
In your Perth we have got a case here

00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:00.760
who is now completely cured; he talks well, he walks well,

00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:03.280
and everything is going on well with him.

00:45:03.480 --> 00:45:06.280
But for this he had to come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.560
God is not going to fall at your feet: “Oh God …

00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:13.120
that Oh please, listen to Me, you are very sick,

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.760
and you must get well, and this should happen.”

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.320
God is not interested. You have to be interested in Him.

00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:22.320
That is one thing that you have to be interested.

00:45:22.520 --> 00:45:25.440
Say, your Prime Minister, if you want to meet him,

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.080
he is not going to come and say, “All right, come and see me,

00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:31.160
I want to meet you, please come.” You have to go and see him.

00:45:31.360 --> 00:45:32.600
He's just a Prime Minister.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:35.200
But this I am talking about who is the Prime Minister

00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.480
of all the Prime Ministers, the highest of all.

00:45:37.720 --> 00:45:39.760
So you have to be interested about God,

00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.840
you have to get to Him, you have to ask for it,

00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.880
otherwise He is not going to fall at your feet.

00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:46.760
That's important to understand.

00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:50.920
Now, so this centre is I've told you about Swadhishthana.

00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:54.120
Now, the next centre is the centre of Nabhi,

00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:57.560
which they have already explained to you what is Nabhi Chakra is,

00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:01.760
but we must know what diseases are caused by bad Nabhi Chakra.

00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.760
First, it is on the left-hand side and right-hand side.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000
There are two types of people: “left Nabhi” and “right Nabhi”.

00:46:09.200 --> 00:46:11.600
The people who suffer from right Nabhi are the people

00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:14.600
who have got all the problems of the liver.

00:46:14.840 --> 00:46:19.760
Now, there was a gentleman who was writing a thesis on alcohol,

00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.200
what is the ,

00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.320
what is the chemical reaction on liver

00:46:27.800 --> 00:46:29.760
when we take alcohol.

00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:32.760
And through Sahaja Yoga only he realized

00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.200
what happens actually to this.

00:46:35.400 --> 00:46:39.000
That water is, as you know, is H2O.

00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:44.600
So H ions are on both the sides, and O is here, is bound by that.

00:46:44.840 --> 00:46:47.880
H2O, there are two H and one O.

00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:53.280
Now, when you start taking water, it gives normal like that.

00:46:53.480 --> 00:46:57.640
And when the blood in the water comes in contact with the liver,

00:46:57.840 --> 00:46:59.280
the liver has the function

00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:02.560
to take away all the poison from the body as heat.

00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:06.560
It absorbs the heat and then transfers it as bile,

00:47:06.800 --> 00:47:09.240
and it goes out of your system.

00:47:09.440 --> 00:47:13.760
But if you take, say alcohol and all these things

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.800
in a very strong way and not in moderation but is too much,

00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.800
then what happens — this edge goes down like this,

00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:24.560
and a barrier is created; and when it goes near the liver,

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:28.240
liver cannot suck in the heat, it cannot suck in the heat.

00:47:28.440 --> 00:47:30.400
And that's how the heat is accumulated,

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.440
the liver goes on malfunctioning,

00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.040
and you always have the trouble of the liver.

00:47:35.240 --> 00:47:37.280
But supposing you come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:37.480 --> 00:47:40.160
Then edge moves like that,

00:47:40.360 --> 00:47:44.640
and all that is heat within you is passed into the liver.

00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:47.920
You'll be amazed, when you will be doing Sahaja Yoga just now,

00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:50.760
we'll be raising your Kundalini , in the beginning you'll find

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.040
lot of heat will be coming out of your head

00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:56.120
before you start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:59.000
First the heat from the liver will be pouring out,

00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:01.320
and you will feel very relieved when it's poured out,

00:48:01.520 --> 00:48:03.840
and then you will start feeling the cool breeze

00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.480
of the Holy Ghost in your hands ,

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.480
which is the all-pervading Power of God, as I told you

00:48:08.680 --> 00:48:11.000
that first time, after realization,

00:48:11.200 --> 00:48:13.640
you can feel that cool breeze within you.

00:48:13.840 --> 00:48:18.360
Now, this chakra gets spoilt on the subtle

00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:20.400
when you are very money-oriented.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:23.120
If you are a very money-oriented person

00:48:23.320 --> 00:48:26.000
and you are always thinking about money, how to get more money,

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.440
like mad, you see there's a rat race of money,

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.000
then this centre goes out.

00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.560
And when this centre goes out, a person suffers from other troubles,

00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.400
not from money troubles maybe but other troubles,

00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:39.760
like he is emotionally dried out.

00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.280
He becomes an unemotional person.

00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:45.800
He becomes a person who has no feelings for anyone.

00:48:46.040 --> 00:48:49.400
Then, I have seen you must have heard about

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.000
the great dacoits [gangs of armed robbers] in India.

00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:54.320
And there is a lady who was a dacoit,

00:48:54.640 --> 00:48:58.160
a small little lady of four feet height.

00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.760
And she was a person,

00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:02.840
she was devoid of any emotions, she could kill anybody,

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:05.480
she could do anything as long as she got the money.

00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.920
I mean, the whole emotional side is completely blocked

00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:12.160
of such a person who thinks too much of money all the time,

00:49:12.360 --> 00:49:16.760
and gradually he becomes very materialistic.

00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:20.880
And a person who is materialistic neglects his heart,

00:49:21.120 --> 00:49:23.360
all the time, he neglects his emotions.

00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.240
He's worried more about the carpets,

00:49:25.440 --> 00:49:27.200
more about this, more about that,

00:49:27.400 --> 00:49:30.800
than the emotions of the people, than the feelings of the people.

00:49:31.080 --> 00:49:33.240
And this kind of imbalance can come

00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:36.080
when your Nabhi Chakra goes out of order

00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:39.760
and you start putting all your attention to money.

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.400
Now, it's most surprising that the countries which are affluent

00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:47.720
have more money orientation than the people who are not.

00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:49.440
It's very surprising.

00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:51.760
Say, for example, in an Indian village,

00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000
a person may not have so many things as you people have,

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.320
but if you go to him, he'll be very happy,

00:49:57.560 --> 00:49:59.640
whatever he has, he would like to serve you ,

00:49:59.840 --> 00:50:01.320
his food , anything that he has.

00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:05.040
He would not like to see that you have not taken your food

00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:07.760
or your milk or something at his residence.

00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:12.000
He'll feel so obliged that you go and you serve him

00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.040
with that joy and with that love that he has.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:18.200
He would like to express his love.

00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:19.600
Now, people misunderstand.

00:50:19.800 --> 00:50:21.760
I've seen, people who are affluent misunderstand.

00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.760
They think it's a slavishness. It is not.

00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:27.120
It is that they find joy in emotional life,

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:29.760
in expressing their joy. To them, it does not matter

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:31.640
if he has to starve for the day, doesn't matter.

00:50:31.840 --> 00:50:34.240
But he has given you food, so he feels that satisfaction:

00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.320
“Oh, God, he has eaten at my place. So sweet of him.”

00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:42.440
There's no slavishness, but is a kind of an expression of that love.

00:50:42.680 --> 00:50:45.240
But in the West I found that people say

00:50:45.440 --> 00:50:48.440
that if you do that to somebody, then people misunderstand,

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.280
they think you are a weak person, as a sign of your weakness.

00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:53.920
I mean, I was amazed how can it be.

00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:57.720
I live in an area which is supposed to be very posh,

00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:01.560
and very, very rich people live there, very rich people.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:07.160
And once it was snowing, snowing very heavily in that area,

00:51:07.360 --> 00:51:10.240
and I, we were shifting that very same day.

00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:13.480
So, I went round ,there's a square where we live,

00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.200
so I went round the square and I deposited some things

00:51:17.400 --> 00:51:20.320
and I saw a lady standing outside

00:51:20.520 --> 00:51:24.280
with a little baby in a pram, and another lady

00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.080
had opened her door little bit and talking to her there.

00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:30.200
And that little baby was in the pram, and it was snowing,

00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.440
can you imagine? And this lady was talking.

00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:34.480
I came back after half an hour,

00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:38.040
still the lady was standing outside, she wouldn't open the door.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:40.400
And they are extremely rich people.

00:51:40.600 --> 00:51:43.560
I can't understand how can a person

00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.480
not feel that a little baby is in the pram.

00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:47.920
They hate children there.

00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:51.680
I've seen, in that area, the people just hate their children.

00:51:51.880 --> 00:51:54.240
They beat them so badly, I'm amazed.

00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.760
And they give it to the servants,

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.560
and the servants look after the children.

00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.120
In England, you'll be amazed

00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:03.760
that two children are killed by their parents every week.

00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.400
First I used to think it is England, but it's not so.

00:52:06.600 --> 00:52:08.920
It is only in London this is happening.

00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:10.760
Can you believe a thing like that?

00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.840
I mean, in India, I can't think of one woman doing that.

00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:16.240
So, emotionally they are very strong people,

00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:18.360
but they lack other things which you have,

00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:21.040
which is to be combined with East and West

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:23.120
and has to be brought to a balance.

00:52:23.320 --> 00:52:24.920
It should not be only emotional life,

00:52:25.200 --> 00:52:27.280
that you want to have more children and more children.

00:52:27.480 --> 00:52:29.320
That's why more children are born in that country.

00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:31.040
They like to have more children.

00:52:31.240 --> 00:52:32.240
Apart from that,

00:52:32.480 --> 00:52:34.920
they are the only people who look after their children so well,

00:52:35.160 --> 00:52:37.280
so all children want to be born there also.

00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.040
They would not like to be born in places where the mother is hard,

00:52:40.240 --> 00:52:43.480
very hottie, and angry for only a little carpet being spoilt,

00:52:43.680 --> 00:52:45.240
or something if the children are spanked.

00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.240
So, naturally, they would like to be born

00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:50.320
with parents who are natural, who are sweet to them.

00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:51.760
And that must be one of the reasons

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.040
why we are suffering from overpopulation.

00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:57.840
While in Germany it is minus, in London it is minus.

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.840
You go to Norway, it is minus, it is Sweden, it is minus.

00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:04.160
On top of that, people are committing suicides.

00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.760
They are competing among themselves, who is doing it more.

00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.600
For example, if you go to , first I heard

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.640
that it was in Sweden people were committing suicide more,

00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:19.040
but now it's Switzerland has taken over, and they are double

00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:21.400
the number who are committing suicide.

00:53:21.720 --> 00:53:23.120
It's I can't understand.

00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.560
I had about three girls from Cambridge, who came from Sweden.

00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:28.760
And they came to Me, and their vibrations were

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.240
like dead people, absolutely numb.

00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.120
I was shocked, these young girls

00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:36.560
between, say, sixteen or twenty, something like that,

00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:40.320
why should they not have that feeling of exuberance,

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:44.040
that joy within them, bubbling with life, such young girls.

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:46.760
And I asked them, I said, “You come and see Me in the house.”

00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:48.320
I mean, I was really surprised.

00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:51.440
And when they came to see Me, I asked them, “What are you doing?”

00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:53.520
They said, “Mother, to tell you the truth,

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.040
we are just planning how to commit suicide.”

00:53:56.240 --> 00:53:57.640
Can you believe it?

00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:59.240
It's such a tragic thing.

00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:01.440
Young girls just planning how to commit suicide.

00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:05.720
But I said, “Why? Why you not? What is so much?”

00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:08.200
They said, “We have, nobody gives us love, nobody loves us,

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.720
there's no love for us.

00:54:10.920 --> 00:54:12.400
We've got money, we've got everything,

00:54:12.600 --> 00:54:15.280
we are daughters of rich families, but there's no love.

00:54:15.520 --> 00:54:18.720
And that's how we want to commit suicide.” Just imagine!

00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:22.400
This is what is happening when one goes too much to materialism.

00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:24.880
Matter can never give us joy, take it from Me.

00:54:25.120 --> 00:54:28.440
It is also in economic science that

00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.880
the material things cannot give you satisfaction, in general.

00:54:33.120 --> 00:54:35.560
They can give one particular thing: you buy, now you buy this,

00:54:35.760 --> 00:54:37.120
all right, then you want to buy that,

00:54:37.320 --> 00:54:38.560
then you want to buy something else.

00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:41.120
But in general, they are not satiable.

00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.040
That means matter cannot give us joy.

00:54:44.240 --> 00:54:46.560
That I do not say that we should not use the matter.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:49.240
You can use the matter for your purpose also

00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:51.360
when you know how to give it to others.

00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:53.640
The joy of matter is in giving.

00:54:53.880 --> 00:54:55.480
Perhaps we have missed the point,

00:54:55.680 --> 00:54:59.240
but after Sahaja Yoga you will know that the joy of matter

00:54:59.440 --> 00:55:02.280
is only felt when you see the beauty of matter

00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:07.240
and when you see what it is to give to others.

00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:08.440
To give to others.

00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:11.280
It's not for yourself that you can ever enjoy,

00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:14.560
but only by giving others you enjoy the matter.

00:55:14.760 --> 00:55:17.040
All right, that's going to a very subtle point,

00:55:17.240 --> 00:55:19.480
but that is what happens to you,

00:55:19.720 --> 00:55:22.080
that you become extremely generous,

00:55:22.280 --> 00:55:26.720
and as a result of that, you enjoy the bliss and happiness,

00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.560
and your own generosity within yourself.

00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.680
I'm supposed to be extremely generous,

00:55:31.880 --> 00:55:34.280
and sometimes Sahaja Yogis are quite worried about Me

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.280
that, by the time I return, I will be finishing with all My saris

00:55:37.520 --> 00:55:39.520
and nothing will be left out of them.

00:55:39.720 --> 00:55:41.320
And they are all the time telling Me,

00:55:41.560 --> 00:55:43.400
“Mother, be careful, You are extremely generous.”

00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:45.280
But I enjoy My generosity,

00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.600
I do not enjoy these possessions so called than My generosity.

00:55:48.800 --> 00:55:50.560
Because if you have a possession, it's a headache.

00:55:50.760 --> 00:55:52.160
You have to go to the insurance,

00:55:52.360 --> 00:55:54.080
you have to worry that it should be kept all right.

00:55:54.280 --> 00:55:56.800
It's better to give it to somebody else and see on other people

00:55:57.040 --> 00:55:58.040
than to have your own.

00:55:58.240 --> 00:55:59.840
If you own it, it's a headache to you.

00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:02.440
But if you give it to others, it's nice. You enjoy it all right.

00:56:02.640 --> 00:56:04.800
You enjoy this hall very well, without owning it.

00:56:05.040 --> 00:56:06.760
If you had owned it, it could have been a headache for you

00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.200
to go up there and look after everything, isn't it?

00:56:09.400 --> 00:56:11.400
It's better not to own this thing.

00:56:11.600 --> 00:56:14.360
Let others have the headache, and let's have the enjoyment.

00:56:14.600 --> 00:56:18.320
That's what is the policy in Sahaja Yoga you try to adopt.

00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:22.360
So now we have the centre, another centre which is very important —

00:56:22.560 --> 00:56:26.640
is the centre of Heart, central Heart we call it,

00:56:26.880 --> 00:56:30.240
is the centre of the Mother of the Universe.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:32.680
In Sanskrit She is called as Jagadamba.

00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:36.840
She is the one who stays there and gives you the sense of security.

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.640
She looks after the saints

00:56:38.840 --> 00:56:41.360
who are trying to get out of this green thing,

00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.560
we call it as the Ocean of Illusion.

00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:47.400
She protects them, She gives them all the help, all the guidance,

00:56:47.600 --> 00:56:51.160
and tries to pull them out of the illusion.

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:55.640
And this is the way She kills all the devils and the demons

00:56:55.840 --> 00:57:00.160
who are, like fake gurus, trying to put down the seekers

00:57:00.360 --> 00:57:02.000
into the illusion more.

00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:04.680
She is the one who's the remover of illusion,

00:57:04.880 --> 00:57:07.840
and this incarnates again and again on this earth,

00:57:08.080 --> 00:57:09.840
to help the seekers

00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:14.680
to get out of the ocean of illusion.

00:57:14.880 --> 00:57:18.920
But when this centre, as in childhood,

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:21.120
starts pulsating first,

00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:25.920
the sternum bone creates lots of antibodies,

00:57:26.200 --> 00:57:29.280
and these are actually the soldiers of the Mother.

00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:32.800
And they go and get distributed in the whole body.

00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:35.200
When you see something coming up on you,

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.120
you get a fear, and you get a palpitation in here.

00:57:38.320 --> 00:57:41.640
That time, that frequency of palpitation

00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:44.760
informs these antibodies to be alert,

00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:48.680
to fight the person who is trying to attack you.

00:57:48.880 --> 00:57:51.120
And that's why it is important to understand

00:57:51.320 --> 00:57:54.760
that this centre builds up your sense of security.

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.520
If this centre is disturbed,

00:57:56.720 --> 00:57:59.360
your sense of security can be disturbed.

00:57:59.600 --> 00:58:04.080
Now, the disease of this centre is mainly is breast cancer.

00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.640
When a woman is insecured in her life, she feels insecured,

00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:09.320
then she develops this trouble.

00:58:09.520 --> 00:58:11.840
When she is insecured as a mother,

00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:14.480
she gets this trouble of breast cancer.

00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:18.440
Now, doctors won't believe it, but I have cured many breast cancers.

00:58:18.640 --> 00:58:21.480
And that can easily be cured by awakening

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:27.800
this special power of the motherhood within you.

00:58:28.040 --> 00:58:30.240
You just become self-confident,

00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.280
and the diseases completely cured, eradicated,

00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:38.160
without, without going into any operation or anything like that.

00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:40.280
Now, there are two other centres you see.

00:58:40.480 --> 00:58:42.920
The one on the right is of your own father,

00:58:43.160 --> 00:58:45.760
and the left is of your own mother.

00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.480
Or, we can say, is a fatherhood and motherhood.

00:58:48.680 --> 00:58:50.520
If you have been a bad father,

00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:54.640
or if your father has been not nice to you, this centre suffers.

00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:58.800
If this centre suffers, then you get the disease called asthma.

00:58:59.040 --> 00:59:00.600
Asthma can only be cured

00:59:00.840 --> 00:59:05.440
if you tell the person who is a Sahaja Yogi about your father,

00:59:05.640 --> 00:59:08.120
what's the problem is, if your father has died,

00:59:08.320 --> 00:59:10.440
if suddenly died, if you are missing him,

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:15.200
or if there is a problem with your own child,anything like that.

00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:18.320
The quality of fatherhood, this is represented by that.

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:22.280
The left side is the mother's thing.

00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:25.800
If the mother is not being very kind to the child,

00:59:26.040 --> 00:59:28.920
the child could be erratic and could be very volcanic

00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:31.920
and temperamental, very temperamental he becomes.

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:33.920
If he had not seen his mother,

00:59:34.160 --> 00:59:38.000
or mother has been a very unkind person,

00:59:38.200 --> 00:59:42.040
then such a person can be absolutely insecured all the time

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:46.000
and could be all the time demanding attention from others,

00:59:46.200 --> 00:59:49.640
and would be very very aggressive on that point.

00:59:49.880 --> 00:59:52.360
So this is what it is. One has to understand

00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:55.400
that these two centres within us are important.

00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:58.760
After Sahaja Yoga, you start understanding your parents.

00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.080
Even if they have been very nasty to you,

01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:04.600
you try to forgive them, and they also come round very well,

01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:07.440
and good relations are established with parents.

01:00:07.640 --> 01:00:11.120
Because you are seekers, sometimes the parents don't understand you.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.520
Because they have no seeking.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:16.480
That's the age group which may not understand your seeking.

01:00:16.720 --> 01:00:20.120
But when they see this transformation coming into you,

01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.120
then you completely changed, you are completely changed.

01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.160
I'll give you an example of a Swiss Sahaja Yogi who came to Me,

01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:31.880
who has written a very big book on Sahaja Yoga called Advent.

01:00:32.160 --> 01:00:34.360
This boy had a father who ,

01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.760
who was leading a life away from the family, gave up the mother,

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:41.240
and he used to have some sort of a relationship,

01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:45.160
and he never had any good relations with his children.

01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:48.120
But when this boy came to Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:51.760
and his younger brother, and his sister,

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:53.920
he was amazed how they were transformed.

01:00:54.160 --> 01:00:57.000
Their ideas were transformed, they were leading such a nice life,

01:00:57.200 --> 01:01:00.840
very sane life, and that they were looking after him also,

01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:04.280
and they were doing whatever is possible to

01:01:04.480 --> 01:01:05.920
just to make him happy.

01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:09.400
And this amazed him because they're not like other children

01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.040
who just try to, all the time,

01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.840
say sharp things to the father and all that.

01:01:14.080 --> 01:01:17.360
Now, one day, one of the Sahaja Yoginis met him

01:01:17.560 --> 01:01:19.760
in a hotel, somewhere,

01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.680
and another person started discussing about Sahaja Yoga.

01:01:23.880 --> 01:01:28.600
He said, “I wish I was born at a time when Sahaja Yoga had started,

01:01:28.800 --> 01:01:31.400
because I would not have wasted my life like that.”

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:35.440
So the parents start seeing that how my children are changing,

01:01:35.640 --> 01:01:38.720
and then they take to your style of life,

01:01:38.920 --> 01:01:40.840
betterment of everything.

01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:45.640
Now, the last chakra I cannot tell you perhaps today,

01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:48.360
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which you can read in the book

01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:51.760
because already there's lot of time and we have to have realization.

01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:53.400
But this is a very important chakra

01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:55.520
because this gives you collectivity.

01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:58.520
This is the centre of the Primordial Being,

01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:03.760
is the centre by which we know the whole, the Akbar,

01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.920
that they say, “Allah hu Akbar!”

01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:09.000
Is the Akbar, is the great Primordial Being,

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:10.800
and we are part and parcel of that.

01:02:11.040 --> 01:02:14.080
So you feel the collectivity within you through this centre.

01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:17.000
Those who spoil this centre,

01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:20.760
you can spoil it by mantras, you can spoil it by talking too much,

01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.120
you may spoil it by not talking at all, all sorts of things.

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:29.760
And this reflects in sixteen sub-plexuses of the cervical plexus,

01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:34.720
which has got to look after your nose, eyes, throat, neck,

01:02:34.920 --> 01:02:38.160
the muscles of the eyes, and your forehead also.

01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:42.480
Is a very important centre within us which gives us collectivity.

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:47.320
The sixth centre which is here is the centre of Agnya Chakra.

01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.520
Agnya Chakra is very important

01:02:49.720 --> 01:02:53.200
because at this centre Lord Jesus Christ came in.

01:02:53.400 --> 01:02:56.320
He is the embodiment of that innocence, that Ganesha.

01:02:56.560 --> 01:02:59.600
He came on this earth, incarnated,

01:02:59.800 --> 01:03:02.160
and He came with the special purpose.

01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:05.160
He came with the purpose to cross through that point,

01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.080
which was very much joined together

01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.920
because, as we have the desire too strong

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:17.200
and then to act on it too strong, these two forces combine together

01:03:17.400 --> 01:03:19.840
in such a way that there is no gap in between.

01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:24.360
So He came to go through that gap, to go through that cross,

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:27.160
and that's why His crucifixion has a big message

01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:29.760
that He came in our awareness

01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.640
to go through that position, which is very subtle,

01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:38.240
because He was Himself the subtlest of subtle.

01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:41.800
He was the one who was the Omkara,

01:03:42.040 --> 01:03:47.480
is the one who was the Logos, as you call it,

01:03:47.680 --> 01:03:50.240
the vibrations, as you see.

01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:53.840
He was that, and because His body was also made of that,

01:03:54.080 --> 01:03:55.480
He could get His resurrection.

01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:59.160
So the Christianity has the message of resurrection.

01:03:59.360 --> 01:04:01.480
And this is the time of resurrection.

01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:04.120
Because He is at the gate there.

01:04:04.320 --> 01:04:06.520
We all have to pass through that gate.

01:04:06.720 --> 01:04:08.760
But when you pass through that gate,

01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:12.120
what happens the Kundalini awakens Jesus Christ.

01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.920
And when Jesus Christ is awakened,

01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:17.520
both these institutions are of ego and superego are sucked in.

01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:19.480
Once they are sucked in, you find

01:04:19.680 --> 01:04:22.640
that this place in your head becomes opened out.

01:04:22.840 --> 01:04:24.760
When this place becomes opened out,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:29.760
you find that this Kundalini also starts pulsating,

01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.640
and afterwards you find Her coming out of your head

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:34.400
and giving you a cool breeze.

01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.160
That's how you achieve your Self-realization.

01:04:37.360 --> 01:04:39.200
So that's how it happens.

01:04:39.400 --> 01:04:42.760
And the seventh chakra I think, when you come

01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:45.520
to the program of these centres and all that,

01:04:45.720 --> 01:04:47.920
they'll explain to you what is seventh chakra

01:04:48.160 --> 01:04:51.840
and how it is the integrated of all the six chakras,

01:04:52.080 --> 01:04:54.480
and the seventh one which is the heart here

01:04:54.720 --> 01:04:56.400
heart, which is the spirit.

01:04:56.600 --> 01:04:59.840
In the heart resides the spirit, and the nature of the spirit

01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:02.440
yesterday I tried to tell you in short.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:05.640
That's what you have to be — Sat-Chit-Ananda,

01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:10.880
means truth, attention, and joy.

01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:13.640
Your attention gets enlightened,

01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:16.320
you get the absolute truth,

01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:18.760
and you become the joy.

01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:20.920
This should happen to all of you.

01:05:21.160 --> 01:05:23.600
I hope in this short time I've been able to explain to you

01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:27.360
the subtle side of these chakras as well as of the gross.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.200
But the subject matter is so great

01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:32.280
that you will be amazed that, at least from London, they have got

01:05:32.480 --> 01:05:35.120
at least thousand tapes here, which you can listen to them,

01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:37.920
on various aspects and dimensions of life,

01:05:38.160 --> 01:05:40.040
and enjoy your realization.

01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.000
Like a bird, after coming out of the egg,

01:05:43.200 --> 01:05:47.200
enjoys all the dimensions of beauty and the glory.

01:05:47.400 --> 01:05:50.800
May God bless you.

01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.440
If you have any questions, please ask Me.

01:05:54.680 --> 01:05:56.840
There's one more thing, which somebody asked Me

01:05:57.080 --> 01:05:59.920
about somebody who was curing, you see, someone,

01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:03.120
through so-called spiritual help. It's not God's help.

01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.200
As I told you, this is coming from the left or the right side,

01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:10.120
it's not God's help. Because if the God's power

01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.480
starts working in you, it transforms you also.

01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.040
If it does not transform you, you are just like a radio.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:18.920
The music is coming through it and going not to the radio.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:23.360
But if it is transforming you completely, then it is God's work.

01:06:23.560 --> 01:06:25.760
Otherwise it is the work of these spirits,

01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:27.520
who are just trying to play some tricks.

01:06:27.720 --> 01:06:29.920
They are busy bodies, so they just try to help you.

01:06:30.160 --> 01:06:32.080
But don't go near them, they are horrid.

01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:36.400
They'll remove one disease, and you'll have another one.

01:06:46.240 --> 01:06:48.480
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?

01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.800
Shri Mataji: You stand there.

01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.920
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?

01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:00.760
Yes.

01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.280
Seeker: Mother, I understand

01:07:02.480 --> 01:07:05.400
that astrology is very important in India.

01:07:05.720 --> 01:07:08.720
Astrology.

01:07:09.480 --> 01:07:13.680
For example, an individual not only an individual but a nation

01:07:13.880 --> 01:07:16.640
can be [unclear] [a particular] astrological [mirror].

01:07:16.840 --> 01:07:20.360
Is the same [unclear] chakras? For example

01:07:20.560 --> 01:07:21.080
Shri Mataji: Yes.

01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.080
Seeker: Is Australia [being part of] [unclear] chakra,

01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.320
or India [unclear] chakra, or …

01:07:26.640 --> 01:07:29.560
Sahaja Yogi: Yeah. He speaks of the astrology.

01:07:29.760 --> 01:07:33.080
Shri Mataji: He's a realized soul, huh? So I can [unclear] him clearly.

01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:36.640
No problem. Now, it's true what you say, it's true.

01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:41.040
Also, that the centres that we have as you see, are seven centres;

01:07:41.240 --> 01:07:44.840
then we have moon and sun, mind centres;

01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:48.360
and there are three above us, they are called ,

01:07:48.560 --> 01:07:50.320
I don't know if I should confuse you,

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:54.000
but they are called as Ardha Bindu, Bindu and Valaya.

01:07:54.200 --> 01:07:56.480
These are three centres above realization.

01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:59.320
These you have to achieve in your realization later on.

01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:05.280
So, now we have twelve of these, and these twelve things make

01:08:05.680 --> 01:08:10.720
for the gross, we should say, for the gross ,

01:08:11.040 --> 01:08:15.280
body of a human being through astrology.

01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:18.360
But we have in India a method

01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:20.640
which we call as Krishnamurti Paddhati [Krishnamurti's system],

01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:25.040
where they can talk about the spiritual side of these centres.

01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:29.920
We have a very nice thing developed in India, very nice.

01:08:30.160 --> 01:08:35.080
Now, when these fake gurus came in,

01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:40.400
their birthdays were taken into account,

01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:43.840
and immediately this astrologer casted horoscopes,

01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:46.160
and they said they are all fake, they are rakshasas,

01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:47.440
they are this, they are that.

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.640
So they changed, all of them, their birthdays and everything.

01:08:50.840 --> 01:08:53.640
It's really remarkable how they changed their birthdays first

01:08:53.840 --> 01:08:55.760
and then they said they don't remember, this, that,

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:57.480
and all sort of things.

01:08:57.680 --> 01:09:00.280
But you should see it

01:09:00.480 --> 01:09:05.480
they have published a very authentic magazine,

01:09:05.800 --> 01:09:09.720
which is dealing from Madras, on astrology. My horoscope,

01:09:09.920 --> 01:09:13.120
it's amazing how they have predicted all the things,

01:09:13.320 --> 01:09:15.800
even about Perth perhaps they have said

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:18.200
that I'll be touching Australia

01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:22.720
and the Australians will be the great Sahaja Yogis.

01:09:22.920 --> 01:09:24.000
It's surprising!

01:09:24.200 --> 01:09:26.360
Sahaja Yogi: He also asked the question:

01:09:26.600 --> 01:09:31.280
“Is other chakras on this earth, and might Australia be a chakra?”

01:09:31.480 --> 01:09:35.120
Shri Mataji: It is. Australia is the Mooladhara itself.

01:09:35.320 --> 01:09:37.640
Is the biggest chakra that you could think of,

01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:41.760
is the Mooladhara, itself, is the first centre, you see?

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.760
If you see, Perth is all red, everywhere, if you see;

01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.760
it's a you have got in the centre of Australia

01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.320
Shri Ganesha sitting down. What you call that?

01:09:52.640 --> 01:09:53.880
Sahaja Yogi: Ayers Rock.

01:09:54.120 --> 01:09:57.840
Shri Mataji: Yes. As you can see, His trunk also red like that.

01:09:58.080 --> 01:10:02.720
It's Mooladhara itself, it's one of the biggest centres

01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:04.880
in Sahaja Yoga, is this …

01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:09.080
SY: And interestingly enough, it's precisely the same longitude of …

01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.720
Shri Mataji: Europe is the liver.

01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:13.920
Sahaja Yogi: … latitude of as the birth place of Shri Mataji.

01:10:14.160 --> 01:10:16.880
Precisely the same latitude

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.720
as the birth place of Shri Mataji in India.

01:10:19.920 --> 01:10:22.120
As it is on the tropic of Cancer,

01:10:22.320 --> 01:10:24.560
so it is on the tropic of Capricorn, almost.

01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:26.800
Shri Mataji: Yes, Australia is very important

01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:29.400
from Sahaja Yoga point of view, very important.

01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:32.400
You see, your basic quality is innocence, imagine.

01:10:32.680 --> 01:10:37.120
Australia, according to Sahaja Yoga, Australia stands for innocence.

01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:39.720
Just a minute, just a minute. Let Me finish one.

01:10:39.920 --> 01:10:44.280
And this innocence is your basic quality,

01:10:44.480 --> 01:10:46.920
is your basic quality.

01:10:47.240 --> 01:10:50.560
According to Sahaja Yoga, Europe is the liver.

01:10:50.760 --> 01:10:53.680
And London is the heart.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:57.000
India is the Kundalini.

01:10:57.480 --> 01:11:00.920
Seeker: Do You know the correct translation for Nabhi?

01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:02.120
Shri Mataji: What did she say?

01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:04.640
Sahaja Yogi: The translation of the Nabhi?
Seeker: Yes.

01:11:04.880 --> 01:11:08.320
Shri Mataji: Nabhi means navel.

01:11:09.120 --> 01:11:12.320
All right? It's navel.

01:11:13.480 --> 01:11:16.240
Nabhi is ,I went to Athens,

01:11:16.440 --> 01:11:19.920
and they told Me this is the navel of the universe.

01:11:20.160 --> 01:11:23.400
I've been telling them that Europe is the navel,

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:26.560
and there I went, they said there in Delphi, they said

01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:30.280
this mount, it represents the navel of the Earth.

01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:33.040
So I tried to feel the vibrations , it was.

01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:35.720
But I turned round, I said, “Why these vibrations are coming?”

01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:38.160
And there it was, Shri Ganesha sitting there,

01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:40.000
like an elephant, little elephant.

01:11:40.200 --> 01:11:42.160
So I asked the translator, I said, “What is this?”

01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:45.560
She said, “Oh, little elephant sitting down there.” Just imagine.

01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:47.160
The Mother Earth has created.

01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.920
This is all created through Mother Earth.

01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:51.760
Which is said in the Bible, that “Thou shalt not worship

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.320
or reproduce something that is created by the Mother Earth.”

01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:57.920
And what is that? That we call as swayambhu,

01:11:58.200 --> 01:12:00.440
the one which is created by Mother Earth.

01:12:00.760 --> 01:12:03.440
And this is one of them, is your Shri Ganesha

01:12:03.640 --> 01:12:08.760
created in the centre of Australia.

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:12.240
Seeker: Do You also concentrate on Your Nabhi if You [unclear]

01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:15.760
[unclear] of the Void?

01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.080
[unclear]?

01:12:19.280 --> 01:12:22.240
Sahaja Yogi: Sorry, your question is not clear.

01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:24.480
Shri Mataji: Please stand up, please stand up. All right?

01:12:24.680 --> 01:12:25.840
We can't hear. Please.

01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.640
Sahaja Yogi: Stand up.
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:29.880
Seeker: When You do Your yoga concentration,

01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:33.760
do You [unclear] at the Void [unclear] Nabhi]?

01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:38.760
Sahaja Yogi: When you do Your yoga concentration, as she calls it,

01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:41.680
do You concentrate on the Void as well as the Nabhi?

01:12:41.880 --> 01:12:44.120
Shri Mataji: No, no, not at all. No, not at all.

01:12:44.320 --> 01:12:46.720
Not to concentrate on your Nabhi or anywhere.

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:51.760
Now see, concentration part doesn't play much part in Sahaja Yoga.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.200
First you allow your attention to be absolutely free, all right?

01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.840
Then the Kundalini rises.

01:12:57.080 --> 01:13:01.600
She rises and comes out of your Brahmarandra, as we call it.

01:13:01.800 --> 01:13:04.640
In case your attention is very wobbly, then we'll say

01:13:04.840 --> 01:13:07.400
that pay attention here a little bit. But there's no need at all.

01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:09.680
The Kundalini comes up and She breaks through.

01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.120
You have to leave your attention little loose,

01:13:12.320 --> 01:13:13.680
not to bother about it.

01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:15.320
But later on what happens

01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:18.560
that when supposing you have a Nabhi problem, as you were saying,

01:13:18.760 --> 01:13:21.120
in the solar plexus you have a problem,

01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:24.000
the Kundalini will again go back and hit there,

01:13:24.200 --> 01:13:26.600
and your attention will be drawn automatically.

01:13:26.800 --> 01:13:29.840
You don't have to pay attention to it. You will, you will be drawn.

01:13:30.080 --> 01:13:32.800
Then by your attention you can raise the Kundalini.

01:13:33.040 --> 01:13:35.880
So you don't have to concentrate anywhere. Just like that.

01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:38.160
It's like if you are driving,

01:13:38.360 --> 01:13:41.080
then you have to just concentrate on driving itself.

01:13:41.280 --> 01:13:45.320
But if you concentrate on any point, you are finished.

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:49.760
So you must know where you are and where you have to move.

01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.200
Before realization, there's no question of concentration.

01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:55.760
It can spoil you completely.

01:13:56.760 --> 01:14:01.320
Seeker: Mataji, is realization synonymous with,

01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:03.760
with enlightenment?
Shri Mataji: Yes, of course.

01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.360
Seeker: So all Your followers that have received realization

01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:08.280
in fact enlightened?
Shri Mataji: Yes yes.

01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:11.120
You see, it means you have to be enlightened.

01:14:11.320 --> 01:14:13.520
It also means atmasakshatkar [one who realized his own spirit].

01:14:13.720 --> 01:14:15.920
It also means what you call that

01:14:16.160 --> 01:14:18.760
to be the pir [saint in Sufism] in [this state].

01:14:19.000 --> 01:14:24.760
In Lao-Tze, I think … he says Tao, Tao,

01:14:25.000 --> 01:14:27.840
that's you have to become that. There are so many things.

01:14:28.080 --> 01:14:32.400
Everybody has said it is that you have to have.

01:14:34.800 --> 01:14:37.720
Yes?

01:14:37.920 --> 01:14:39.240
Seeker: Perhaps You could explain,

01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:42.000
the meaning of one occasion,

01:14:42.200 --> 01:14:44.440
several years ago.

01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:47.640
It was a New Years eve when I was

01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.760
alone in the middle of Ayers Rock,

01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:54.240
now it started [unclear] full moon,

01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.760
and I climbed up Ayers Rock

01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.480
with the intention of sleeping on Ayers Rock alone that night.

01:15:01.680 --> 01:15:04.440
And just looking up,

01:15:04.760 --> 01:15:10.240
Ayers Rock was right in the middle of [unclear].

01:15:10.440 --> 01:15:12.360
And I was terrified, I [unclear],

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:14.760
I couldn't stay on there... [unclear].

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:17.680
Shri Mataji: He was trying over the Ganesha.

01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:19.720
Sahaja Yogi: He went up on the night with full moon,

01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:24.240
he was absolutely frightened and shaking and

01:15:24.440 --> 01:15:26.440
Shri Mataji: On Ganesha's?

01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:29.880
Seeker: It was like being confronted with eternity.

01:15:30.120 --> 01:15:31.760
Sahaja Yogi: Like being confronted by eternity.

01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:34.000
Shri Mataji: My child, you have been to all horrible gurus, you see.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.200
Naturally, Ganesha was trying to frighten you there.

01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:39.760
He frightens, not only that, He is the one who gives you

01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.400
all these horrible experiences of heat and these blisters,

01:15:43.600 --> 01:15:45.360
and He is the one who gets angry,

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:47.680
because He doesn't like the way people are.

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.920
You see, it's the one , He is the one who gets upset.

01:15:52.160 --> 01:15:54.760
Kundalini is there, He looks after Her protocol.

01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.920
But He cannot understand why people are doing wrong things,

01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:00.720
going to the , because He is wisdom, He is the embodiment of wisdom,

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:03.920
and if you have done something unwise, He gets angry with you.

01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:06.560
That must be the reason.

01:16:06.800 --> 01:16:08.840
We have seen some people who come to Me also shake

01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.360
with the beginning a little bit. Doesn't matter.

01:16:13.440 --> 01:16:16.440
Sahaja Yogi: Any other questions?

01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:22.400
Shri Mataji: Are you all right now?
Seeker:      Yes, Mother.

01:16:22.600 --> 01:16:25.560
Shri Mataji: Good, good. So,doesn't matter.

01:16:25.800 --> 01:16:28.800
Sahaja Yogi: Yes?

01:16:29.720 --> 01:16:34.040
Seeker: Can , can Mother heal me? I had a stroke some years ago.

01:16:34.240 --> 01:16:35.200
Shri Mataji: What is it?

01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:38.480
Sahaja Yogi: Can she be healed? She had a stroke some years ago.

01:16:38.680 --> 01:16:40.040
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, of course.

01:16:40.240 --> 01:16:42.400
Sahaja Yogi: Have you got paralysis? Partial paralysis.

01:16:42.600 --> 01:16:45.240
Shri Mataji: [Just listen], this is nothing that can't be healed,

01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:47.920
no doubt.

01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:51.480
Seeker: [unclear] I have received it,

01:16:51.800 --> 01:16:57.120
and You have curing emanations,curing emanations,

01:16:57.320 --> 01:17:01.760
that [unclear]

01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.360
Shri Mataji: I can't hear her.

01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:06.440
Sahaja Yogi: Are you saying that She emits emanation, that …

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:10.920
Seeker: No. No, [unclear], [this was the problem].

01:17:11.160 --> 01:17:12.920
And …

01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:16.200
Shri Mataji: I can't hear her.

01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:19.480
Madam, please get up. We can't hear you. All right?

01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:21.720
Seeker: I can understand about the enlightenment,

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.240
but I can't understand about the emanations

01:17:24.440 --> 01:17:29.080
that You [unclear] [impossible]

01:17:29.280 --> 01:17:31.720
[unclear]

01:17:31.920 --> 01:17:32.720
Shri Mataji: What is she ,

01:17:32.920 --> 01:17:34.440
Sahaja Yogi: She can understand about the enlightenment.

01:17:34.760 --> 01:17:37.480
She cannot understand about the emanations of,

01:17:37.680 --> 01:17:39.840
probably she means Your power.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.680
Shri Mataji: You will understand that, all right? Gradually.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:45.840
Everything you can't understand in one day, can you?

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:48.400
You will understand everything. You don't worry about Me.

01:17:48.720 --> 01:17:50.200
You just worry about yourself.

01:17:50.400 --> 01:17:53.000
I've not said anything about Myself, have I said?

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:55.120
I never said anything.

01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.680
I've been very humble. I've never said anything. I dare not.

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:03.800
Because it's not wise, I've learnt it.

01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:06.040
See, those who said it had a bad time.

01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:08.160
It's difficult. If you say something about yourself,

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:11.240
suddenly the ego will come and just punch at you.

01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.760
No, it's very bad. I've never said a word about Myself.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:16.600
So you don't try to understand Me just now,

01:18:16.800 --> 01:18:18.360
first you understand yourself, all right?

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:21.760
Then you understand Me.

01:18:23.000 --> 01:18:23.800
Sahaja Yogi: Any other questions?

01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:27.080
Otherwise we'll have the experience of Self-realization.

01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:28.920
This is what Mother has come for.

01:18:29.160 --> 01:18:31.760
Really a lecture is not the important part,

01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:34.400
the experience of Self-realization is it.

01:18:34.600 --> 01:18:38.440
We'll switch the fans off, and you'll feel it for yourself.

01:18:38.640 --> 01:18:41.720
Any other questions?

01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:43.720
Could you turn the fans off?

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:47.400
Seeker: If we're Your devotees, do you also look after us?

01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:53.120
SY: If these people are Your devotees, do You look after them?

01:18:53.320 --> 01:18:56.280
Shri Mataji: What else I,I look after them.

01:18:56.480 --> 01:19:02.000
Ask them, better ask them if I've looked after them or not.

01:19:03.760 --> 01:19:05.240
Sahaja Yogi: I think it's obvious that

01:19:05.440 --> 01:19:08.040
insofar as all of us have got physically well;

01:19:08.240 --> 01:19:13.440
our nervous, mental, psychological problems have been healed;

01:19:13.680 --> 01:19:16.680
if we're endangered by an accident,

01:19:16.880 --> 01:19:21.360
if there's any particular problem which we want to solve,

01:19:21.680 --> 01:19:24.120
within our own life or within relationships,

01:19:24.320 --> 01:19:28.920
we put that at the attention of Almighty God,

01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:33.040
and by doing so we find that it gets solved.

01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:37.760
We've got all sorts of little methods

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.720
by which we work things out.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:42.640
We showed you some of them today,

01:19:42.840 --> 01:19:44.760
in working out how the chakras are cleared.

01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:47.720
You can learn all of these things at the centre.

01:19:47.920 --> 01:19:52.720
There are certain aspects which you won't fully understand

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:56.640
until you actually achieve the awakening of Kundalini,

01:19:56.840 --> 01:19:59.000
but as you grow in it, you'll understand more fully

01:19:59.200 --> 01:20:00.720
how the blessings of God

01:20:00.920 --> 01:20:03.760
actually descend upon you in a tremendous way.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:07.760
You get, your well-being is cared for, your health is cared for.

01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:11.120
Your psychological problems are solved.

01:20:11.320 --> 01:20:13.400
You become a complete and whole person,

01:20:13.600 --> 01:20:15.400
and this is the very beautiful part.

01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:18.360
When this lady asked is enlightenment synonymous

01:20:18.600 --> 01:20:20.520
with Self-realization,

01:20:20.720 --> 01:20:24.000
the answer is yes, but it's a growth process.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:27.760
You touch it or maybe you go more than that at the beginning

01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:31.040
and from that touching of Self-realization

01:20:31.240 --> 01:20:34.800
you grow from that point to a complete realized being.

01:20:35.040 --> 01:20:37.360
But you are an enlightened being because you've started

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.760
that final journey in your spiritual evolution.

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.880
We've had a human evolution this far.

01:20:43.120 --> 01:20:45.320
Now we've reached our spiritual evolution,

01:20:45.520 --> 01:20:48.120
and the road is very very rapid now.

01:20:48.320 --> 01:20:50.760
Because in this lifetime we can achieve

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.120
that state of full realization,

01:20:53.320 --> 01:20:56.120
just by these techniques, very simple techniques

01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.600
that will be shown to you by the devotees of Shri Mataji.

01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:04.480
Shri Mataji: But I must confess one thing to you people:

01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:07.600
that your guru was very allergic to flowers and things,

01:21:07.800 --> 01:21:10.760
I'm very allergic to this dress, absolutely.

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:12.720
Because this is not your style.

01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:14.720
You see, this dress is to be worn by people

01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:17.640
who lead an absolute celibate life

01:21:17.840 --> 01:21:21.080
and is meant for people who are not householders.

01:21:21.280 --> 01:21:24.240
And another thing is, if you read Valmiki Ramayana

01:21:24.440 --> 01:21:27.200
I don't know people read that or not, where Shri Sita

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.080
has said that a sannyasi has nothing to do with householders at all.

01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:37.120
If there's a real sannyasi, he should stay out of the city,

01:21:37.320 --> 01:21:39.840
out of the village, only for one day.

01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:43.240
And he is to be given one-day alms and finished with it.

01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:45.400
Because you know what happened with Her,

01:21:45.600 --> 01:21:47.120
that Ravana came in this dress,

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:49.320
and that's how I'm very allergic to this dress.

01:21:49.520 --> 01:21:52.200
Because it's not true, it's not true.

01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.760
Have you renounced the whole world? You have not.

01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:57.320
So, not to go in for this kind of a thing,

01:21:57.640 --> 01:22:01.440
you have to be normal people, you have to be living normally,

01:22:01.640 --> 01:22:03.000
accepting what you are

01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:05.360
and not announcing something which you are not.

01:22:05.560 --> 01:22:06.800
You see, this is what the gurus do

01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:08.640
they give you a dress and these things.

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.440
So, if you want to have Sahaja Yoga

01:22:10.760 --> 01:22:13.080
of course, today I hope I'll give you realization,

01:22:13.280 --> 01:22:14.920
but afterwards you give up all this nonsense,

01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:16.160
you become normal people.

01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.000
You have to be absolutely normal.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:21.440
Nothing abnormal about it, recluses, funny type not.

01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:24.080
We have to get the whole world out of [their ?] problems.

01:22:24.280 --> 01:22:27.480
We can't just do it for ourself, individual some sort of a nonsense.

01:22:27.720 --> 01:22:31.040
No, we have to be responsible for the whole world,

01:22:31.240 --> 01:22:33.120
and we have to be absolutely normal people,

01:22:33.320 --> 01:22:37.240
behave in a normal way, not in an abnormal way, all right?

01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.480
So I'm very allergic to this dress.

01:22:39.680 --> 01:22:41.920
I'm just telling you, I hope I give you realization,

01:22:42.160 --> 01:22:45.200
because you are seekers, I can see that, all of you are seekers.

01:22:45.400 --> 01:22:46.760
You should get your realization.

01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.560
But I'm absolutely allergic to this.

01:22:48.760 --> 01:22:50.360
Because their guru is allergic to flowers.

01:22:50.560 --> 01:22:53.640
Imagine, God is so fond of flowers. I can't do without flowers.

01:22:53.840 --> 01:22:59.720
I can't understand how can any saintly man be allergic to flowers.

01:23:02.800 --> 01:23:03.480
So …

01:23:03.680 --> 01:23:07.680
Sahaja Yogi: OK. Then, any last question? Then we'll have it.

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:12.200
OK.
