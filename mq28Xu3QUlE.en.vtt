02:52:50.856 --> 02:52:55.016
My heart is so full,

02:52:56.360 --> 02:52:59.800
because in this great drama

02:53:00.680 --> 02:53:06.160
you have really shown the beauty of Mohammed's life;

02:53:07.240 --> 02:53:10.480
how people have misused

02:53:10.760 --> 02:53:16.320
and troubled all the world around;

02:53:16.680 --> 02:53:19.200
and now, they are in trouble.

02:53:20.480 --> 02:53:23.120
He never wanted that

02:53:23.360 --> 02:53:27.800
but how human beings misunderstand

02:53:28.000 --> 02:53:30.400
such a great prophet like him.

02:53:30.600 --> 02:53:35.000
I must congratulate Guido and the all of you

02:53:35.200 --> 02:53:38.640
for acting so well and what a drama it was!

02:53:38.840 --> 02:53:42.520
The synchronization and all that also technique things you...

02:53:42.720 --> 02:53:44.240
I don’t know what to say…

02:53:44.440 --> 02:53:49.200
in every way it was a very, very beautiful drama.

02:54:06.360 --> 02:54:08.840
It has touched My heart

02:54:09.040 --> 02:54:13.720
because Mohammed is not understood by his followers,

02:54:13.920 --> 02:54:16.480
not the ones who opposed him;

02:54:16.880 --> 02:54:20.120
such a great man of compassion,

02:54:20.360 --> 02:54:23.440
such a great man of spirituality

02:54:23.640 --> 02:54:27.000
has been so much misunderstood

02:54:27.400 --> 02:54:30.840
and Islamic world, so called,

02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:34.240
and non-Islamic, so called,

02:54:34.480 --> 02:54:38.840
they never understood the greatness of Mohammed Sahib.

02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:42.680
I mean, I was really

02:54:42.880 --> 02:54:45.280
very much touched by this because

02:54:45.480 --> 02:54:48.120
he was my loveliest son

02:54:48.320 --> 02:54:50.920
and I worshipped him.

02:54:51.120 --> 02:54:53.320
May God bless his soul

02:54:53.560 --> 02:54:56.480
and all of you who followed him

02:54:56.680 --> 02:54:58.640
in spirit.

02:54:58.840 --> 02:55:01.000
Spread the news,

02:55:01.200 --> 02:55:03.680
get more people into Sahaja Yoga;

02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:09.680
very easy to get Mohammed’s disciples into Sahaja Yoga

02:55:09.880 --> 02:55:13.040
if they are really his disciples.

02:55:13.240 --> 02:55:16.160
It’s not difficult to get them into Sahaja Yoga

02:55:16.360 --> 02:55:18.800
because he has already described,

02:55:19.000 --> 02:55:22.200
described that at the time

02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:25.120
of resurrection your hands will speak.

02:55:25.320 --> 02:55:27.240
He has already said so precisely.

02:55:27.440 --> 02:55:29.280
Nobody has said that,

02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:32.080
nobody has said that so far;

02:55:32.280 --> 02:55:35.080
so that shows how great he was.

02:55:35.280 --> 02:55:40.760
All the qualities of these great prophets have been misused,

02:55:40.960 --> 02:55:44.920
have been really misinterpreted,

02:55:45.120 --> 02:55:47.960
creating all kinds of problems;

02:55:48.160 --> 02:55:51.680
while they came here to solve our problems,

02:55:51.880 --> 02:55:55.240
while what we have done is to create problems.

02:55:56.480 --> 02:55:59.960
I have such a feeling for them, for all of them.

02:56:00.200 --> 02:56:03.200
Today I learned about Pales, Palestinians

02:56:03.400 --> 02:56:06.840
that they are absolutely fed up now

02:56:07.440 --> 02:56:10.120
and that’s why they are killing themselves;

02:56:10.480 --> 02:56:13.920
because they have no place to live, they have no homes, no,

02:56:14.120 --> 02:56:16.600
nothing, they have no prospects.

02:56:16.800 --> 02:56:20.160
But also we must tell the Jews

02:56:20.360 --> 02:56:21.920
to understand them;

02:56:22.120 --> 02:56:23.720
it is both ways:

02:56:23.920 --> 02:56:25.840
one has to have a balance -

02:56:26.040 --> 02:56:28.080
an understanding of each other.

02:56:28.280 --> 02:56:31.960
God has not created this world to get destroyed;

02:56:32.160 --> 02:56:34.960
so, nobody has the right to destroy this world.

02:56:35.160 --> 02:56:37.960
So, I think we should have a very balanced look

02:56:38.160 --> 02:56:40.160
at all these things and also

02:56:40.360 --> 02:56:42.800
if we get them realized,

02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:49.200
anywhere, whether they are in Islamic religion

02:56:49.400 --> 02:56:52.400
or they are non Islamic, anywhere…

02:56:52.600 --> 02:56:55.680
they will realize what is the truth is.

02:56:55.880 --> 02:56:59.560
Unless and until you know the truth how can you fight and for what,

02:56:59.760 --> 02:57:02.160
what are you fighting for?

02:57:02.360 --> 02:57:06.320
So, I am very happy in a way that Sahaja Yogis have understood it

02:57:06.520 --> 02:57:10.600
and this great man has been brought to the stage

02:57:10.800 --> 02:57:12.680
and that you all have appreciated it.

02:57:12.880 --> 02:57:15.320
So, now have compassion,

02:57:15.520 --> 02:57:18.080
as he said, and Love for God.

02:57:18.280 --> 02:57:19.880
That’s very important;

02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:23.520
though they are misled as Christians have been misled.

02:57:23.720 --> 02:57:28.040
All these stupid people who follow the religion, so called,

02:57:28.280 --> 02:57:30.680
have misled the whole world,

02:57:30.920 --> 02:57:36.680
But the Sahaja Yogis must take to the truth.

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:39.080
And they don’t have to fight much;

02:57:39.280 --> 02:57:42.280
they can manage very easily,

02:57:42.480 --> 02:57:44.520
need not have swords or anything,

02:57:44.720 --> 02:57:47.680
just they can manage with their Love,

02:57:47.880 --> 02:57:51.320
with their compassion and with their wisdom,

02:57:51.520 --> 02:57:54.480
which is very important for Sahaja Yogis,

02:57:54.680 --> 02:57:56.600
that they should have that wisdom.

02:57:56.800 --> 02:58:00.200
I want to again congratulate Guido and Company

02:58:00.400 --> 02:58:05.520
who have brought such a beautiful thing about Mohammed Sahib.

02:58:05.720 --> 02:58:10.040
I have tremendous respect for him because

02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:14.040
he has got the talent of a great dramatist;

02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:18.760
I mean, just imagine the synchronization and everything, the acting.

02:58:18.960 --> 02:58:22.360
Apart from you people being very great actors and actresses,

02:58:22.560 --> 02:58:24.800
he also is a great organizer

02:58:25.000 --> 02:58:27.600
and such a big drama has been done.

02:58:27.800 --> 02:58:31.680
I don’t know if any television would like to show this drama

02:58:32.080 --> 02:58:36.040
because, I don’t know,

02:58:36.240 --> 02:58:39.080
their style is different, their ways are different,

02:58:39.280 --> 02:58:40.600
and they have to grow still

02:58:40.800 --> 02:58:44.680
but whatever it is it’s a beautiful drama I’ve ever seen.

02:58:44.920 --> 02:58:46.640
May God bless you all,

02:58:46.800 --> 02:58:50.840
and specially Mr. Guido, the great!
