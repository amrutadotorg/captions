Shri Krishna -Virata Puja
“Rise above the Ego to enter Virata’s Kingdom”
September 9, 1999 Cabella, Italia

00:10:53.020 --> 00:11:02.079
Tonight we are going to worship Shri Krishna
as Virat.

00:11:02.079 --> 00:11:16.779
First is important to understand the incarnation
of Shri Krishna.

00:11:16.779 --> 00:11:20.130
Krishna word comes from the word Krishi.

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.380
Krishi means agriculture.

00:11:22.380 --> 00:11:30.410
He’s sown the seeds of spirituality.

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:41.140
And for that, first of all, He had to think,
“Where are we as far as spirituality is

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:46.060
concerned, how is the land?”

00:11:46.060 --> 00:11:56.609
So what had happened at the time of Shri Rama
that He created lots of maryadas and by these

00:11:56.609 --> 00:12:02.160
maryadas people started mentally thinking
about it, “I am not supposed to do that,

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.100
I am not supposed to do this.”

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:12.080
It was just a mental binding – it was not
spontaneous, it was not sahaj.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.820
As a result people became extremely serious.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:23.880
They wouldn’t talk much and they wouldn’t
laugh; they wouldn’t enjoy anything.

00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:32.389
So Shri Krishna decided that “First of all
we must remove them from this conditioning.

00:12:32.389 --> 00:12:46.140
And this conditioning has to be removed in
such a manner that they enjoy themselves.”

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:55.920
Then He found out, there were three suggestions
as far as achieving the goal was concerned.

00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:09.010
So first one, as He says, is to become a realized
soul, Sthitapragya, to go beyond all temptations,

00:13:09.010 --> 00:13:20.420
go beyond all ego, go beyond all kinds of
conditioning and to become a Sthitapragya.

00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:37.390
Sthitapragya is where he doesn’t feel like
ordinary people attracted towards things,

00:13:37.390 --> 00:13:43.380
but he’s absolutely detached.

00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:58.390
And this detached person doesn’t take to
any grievances, jealousies, all these things.

00:13:58.390 --> 00:14:03.520
That He told.

00:14:03.520 --> 00:14:09.050
But how to achieve it He never told.

00:14:09.050 --> 00:14:12.949
And the second thing He described is that
you must work.

00:14:12.949 --> 00:14:13.949
You have to work.

00:14:13.949 --> 00:14:22.190
After all, you have got all the human tendencies
– is to work.

00:14:22.190 --> 00:14:30.289
But the fruit of the work, you leave it at
the Lotus Feet of God or you may call the

00:14:30.289 --> 00:14:34.160
divine Power.

00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:40.520
This is another trick of His, because He realized
how human beings were twisted and how they

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.520
had a ego.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:44.470
If you tell them something, how they’ll
misinterpret it.

00:14:44.470 --> 00:14:49.690
So He took the other way round, that tell
them something absurd.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:15:04.900
Now whatever work you do, your ego is intact
and with that ego, you can never give it up

00:15:04.900 --> 00:15:09.450
at the Lotus Feet of the Divine, then impossible.

00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:16.240
So He made a impossible situation, that after
some time people will realize that this cannot

00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:25.750
be done and they’ll give up this idea of
leaving everything at the Lotus Feet of the

00:15:25.750 --> 00:15:27.340
Divine.

00:15:27.340 --> 00:15:32.510
This was the one how He prepared the land.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:39.450
Second thing He said, “Pushpam phalam toyum.

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:46.860
Flowers, fruit and water.

00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.430
Whatever you offer Me, I will take it.

00:15:49.430 --> 00:15:52.210
I’ll take it.”

00:15:52.210 --> 00:15:59.390
But when you do that, when you do that you
must have ananya bhakti.

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:13.440
Ananya means completely single-minded bhakti,
when there is not the other.

00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:18.280
This is only possible after realization.

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:27.250
Only after realization you can put the fruits
of your work at the Lotus Feet of the Divine.

00:16:27.250 --> 00:16:35.530
And only after Self-realization you can have
ananya bhakti – means the devotion which

00:16:35.530 --> 00:16:40.430
is singular.

00:16:40.430 --> 00:16:47.470
These absurd conditions He put for human beings
because they were so much complicated.

00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:51.890
So many people tell Me, “Mother we are doing
ananya bhakti.”

00:16:51.890 --> 00:16:52.890
“How?”

00:16:52.890 --> 00:16:57.600
“Because we are singing on the street, we
are taking the name of God all the time.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:17:07.660
We are going to Pandharipur, you see, in rags
and for one month we walk singing, singing,

00:17:07.660 --> 00:17:08.660
singing.”

00:17:08.660 --> 00:17:16.160
This kind of absurd ideas about bhakti, He
never gave.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:24.850
But it is the way He wanted to neutralize
the absurdities of human beings, that they

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:27.240
thought this was the bhakti.

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:28.670
Which is not.

00:17:28.670 --> 00:17:34.280
Ananya bhakti is only possible when you are
realized soul, when you are connected with

00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:39.480
the Divine, when there’s not the other.

00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:48.710
This is how He tried to make three-way attack
I should (say), on human beings, in a way,

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.340
on their stupidity.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:56.090
Because He thought that “If I tell them
directly do like this, do like that, then

00:17:56.090 --> 00:18:01.420
they’ll say, ‘Of course we did it, and
still we never achieved it.’”

00:18:01.420 --> 00:18:09.760
In India there’s a big cult, we can call
it – people who go to Pandharipur.

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:17.170
For one month they walk in rags, singing the
songs and on the way they go on eating food

00:18:17.170 --> 00:18:19.400
at different places.

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:24.130
According to them this is ananya bhakti, and
they achieve nothing.

00:18:24.130 --> 00:18:33.430
They have become very sick and very tired
and have a very bad old age.

00:18:33.430 --> 00:18:35.720
But who can tell them?

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:38.180
They are all lost in it.

00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:48.080
So this is a way one could tackle human beings
to show their stupidity.

00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:54.030
And so many people come and ask Me, as I told
you, that “How is it we do so much bhakti

00:18:54.030 --> 00:18:59.460
of Shri Krishna and we have achieved nothing?”

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.630
So He’s the One who prepared the land for
sowing.

00:19:03.630 --> 00:19:12.310
We can say He’s the One who was like a very
great agriculturist.

00:19:12.310 --> 00:19:14.240
So His name was Krishi – Krishna.

00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:21.000
There are so many things I have told you about
Him: how His name came as Krishna, then as

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:30.020
how He was called as Radha, who was Radha,
who was Krishna and all those things.

00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:38.760
But when He talked of these things also He
told that you should become Sthitapragya.

00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:41.030
That is they call as Gyana Yoga.

00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:43.350
Gyana means knowledge.

00:19:43.350 --> 00:19:47.340
So, you should get absolute knowledge.

00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:49.350
That He didn’t say how.

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.750
That you know, what is absolute knowledge,
which you can feel it on your finger tips

00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:59.950
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:05.930
Another thing is, His specialty was to create
discretion in people.

00:20:05.930 --> 00:20:12.490
He thought by doing all these things in a
stupid manner, they might develop a discretion

00:20:12.490 --> 00:20:16.140
to know that this is not the way you can achieve
anything.

00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.500
You have to get your Self-realization.

00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:21.680
Discretion was very important.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:34.210
At this juncture, when we are facing a sort
of a challenge of this new millennium – that

00:20:34.210 --> 00:20:39.350
the whole world is going to be destroyed and
all those things people are talking – it

00:20:39.350 --> 00:20:50.850
is really very important to know through discretion
what is good and what is bad.

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:56.890
One may talk of something as very good, something
as very bad.

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:01.852
But the divine Discretion is very, very different.

00:21:01.852 --> 00:21:05.950
Very different and which acts by Itself.

00:21:05.950 --> 00:21:12.250
Once you are in the realm of divine Discretion
you cannot commit mistakes – even if you

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:13.250
want to do it.

00:21:13.250 --> 00:21:15.820
I’ll give you My example.

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:25.450
We went to buy a house and the fellow was,
you see, like a beggar he came.

00:21:25.450 --> 00:21:27.240
He said, “We have nothing.

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.780
We have no food.

00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:33.920
They have taken away all our things and we
are just absolutely starving.”

00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:45.620
When they said that, when he said that “We
are starving, we have nothing,” so I felt

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:46.620
pity for him.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.520
I said, “All right, increase the price.”

00:21:48.520 --> 00:21:50.660
First we increased the price.

00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:54.030
Still he was saying, “No, no give us more.”

00:21:54.030 --> 00:21:55.710
Still we increased the price.

00:21:55.710 --> 00:21:58.060
I told My husband, “You increase the price.”

00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:01.380
Though reluctantly, he increased the price.

00:22:01.380 --> 00:22:04.030
Third time again we increased the price.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:08.980
Then he said, “No, we’ll have something
more than that, a little more.”

00:22:08.980 --> 00:22:15.570
Immediately you see, this Discretion worked
and I said, “These are hypocrites.”

00:22:15.570 --> 00:22:20.590
I just left them and sat in the car – at
the right moment.

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:25.130
That was not such a good proposition or anything.

00:22:25.130 --> 00:22:32.040
But I could see they, I’m buying it out
of My pity; you may call it compassion.

00:22:32.040 --> 00:22:38.370
But above the compassion was this Discretion,
which said, “Nothing doing, You better get

00:22:38.370 --> 00:22:39.840
out of it.”

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:46.550
So this divine Discretion is a very, very
important thing, which we should see how it

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.000
works and should be satisfied with it.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:57.110
Not to feel bad, that you have missed a chance
or anything, but you must feel very happy

00:22:57.110 --> 00:23:04.690
that this thing has happened and that your
divine discretion has taken on.

00:23:04.690 --> 00:23:11.700
So sometimes it appears that, in that divine
discretion you may do something wrong, you

00:23:11.700 --> 00:23:12.700
have done something wrong.

00:23:12.700 --> 00:23:18.340
But if it is divine, ultimately it will turn
out to be very good.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.320
I gave you a very basic example.

00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:32.140
But that is also very true when you practice
Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:41.750
The discretion of divine Discretion is extremely
important to play a very great part in our

00:23:41.750 --> 00:23:51.170
lives, because this divine Discretion gives
us the real joy of our being, of our self,

00:23:51.170 --> 00:23:54.200
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:54.200 --> 00:24:01.610
So the third point was for Him to make people
joyous and happy.

00:24:01.610 --> 00:24:09.120
But with all these maryadas of Shri Rama,
He didn’t know how to do it.

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:16.969
So to give people joy He said, “All right,
let us dance, let us sing, let us play Holi,

00:24:16.969 --> 00:24:25.480
all sorts of things,” and with that He really
originated many things which were sort of

00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:27.350
not serious.

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:31.610
May look frivolous, but in that there was
joy expressing.

00:24:31.610 --> 00:24:41.301
All that He did to give them a full idea as
for a Sahaja yogi or for a, you can say, for

00:24:41.301 --> 00:24:47.970
a self realized soul, what should be the attitude
towards everything.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:57.380
But it is not that you have to do it, but
it just works out, it is like that, that in

00:24:57.380 --> 00:25:02.150
the state of Sahaj, you enjoy everything.

00:25:02.150 --> 00:25:04.150
Enjoyment.

00:25:04.150 --> 00:25:12.030
And that is what His idea was, to create a
sense of joy among people.

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:16.940
Many people – there are lots of critics
– have criticized this part of His life.

00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:20.840
According to them, religion means you should
become just old.

00:25:20.840 --> 00:25:26.830
At the age of twenty years you should become
an old man of eighty years – something like

00:25:26.830 --> 00:25:31.770
that, funny ideas of religious achievement.

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:37.640
But He talked of joy and He never talked of
renunciation.

00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:46.130
He never talked that “You give up your family,
you give up your children, you give up everything,”

00:25:46.130 --> 00:25:47.590
never, never.

00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:52.690
He said, “You must enjoy, enjoy with detachment.”

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:58.110
For people it is very difficult to understand
how can it be it is without detachment.

00:25:58.110 --> 00:26:01.930
With attachment you can never enjoy.

00:26:01.930 --> 00:26:08.340
If you are attached to something, you cannot
enjoy anything in a full way.

00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:11.469
Like, supposing you are attached to your child.

00:26:11.469 --> 00:26:14.410
Very simple thing, you are attached to your
child.

00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:20.150
You’re attached to your child, then you
will be bothered about things which should

00:26:20.150 --> 00:26:23.900
not be there, which will not give joy to the
child either.

00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:31.280
You’ll not allow your child, say, to go
out or to talk to people, whatever it is – all

00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:34.120
kinds of restrictions you will put.

00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:42.760
But if you have really the divine discretion,
then you will know with whom he should talk,

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:51.300
where he should go, what he should enjoy and
you will see that he enjoys life.

00:26:51.300 --> 00:26:59.580
Any attachment with anything doesn’t give
you the full view of that person, of that

00:26:59.580 --> 00:27:01.310
thing.

00:27:01.310 --> 00:27:11.340
If you are detached, then you can see it,
say, from above … above him, above the thing.

00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:15.610
If you are detached, you become thoughtlessly
aware, also.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:19.200
As I said, now, see the carpets are there.

00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:22.580
They are very, very beautiful carpets.

00:27:22.580 --> 00:27:28.540
Now if they are here, if they are Mine, I’ll
be worried, I’ll be all the time worried

00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:35.810
because I am attached – that these carpets
should not be spoilt, something will go wrong.

00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:40.110
But if I’m not attached, I’ll look at
those carpets and what do I see?

00:27:40.110 --> 00:27:41.370
The joy.

00:27:41.370 --> 00:27:46.610
The joy that is put in by the artist who has
made them.

00:27:46.610 --> 00:27:54.880
And that joy really tries to reflect in Me
also.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:57.839
That joy comes in Me.

00:27:57.839 --> 00:28:07.220
So to have anything, attachment to anything,
there will be joy … I should say there’ll

00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:10.780
be happiness but not joy.

00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:19.460
Because joy is single and happiness is double
– happiness and unhappiness.

00:28:19.460 --> 00:28:24.260
So even if I try to enjoy something, I’ll
think, “Oh, still there, this, this point

00:28:24.260 --> 00:28:25.900
is there.”

00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:28.860
But joy is all pervading.

00:28:28.860 --> 00:28:32.360
It has no boundaries.

00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:37.350
And you just get dissolved, you get dissolved
in the ocean of joy.

00:28:37.350 --> 00:28:45.010
That was what Shri Krishna’s idea was, that
cut out these maryadas.

00:28:45.010 --> 00:28:51.160
Nowadays we see the maryadas of so many things
are really useless.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:56.470
For example, you have discovered the maryadas
of religion.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:29:00.640
See when they live in maryadas then what happens?

00:29:00.640 --> 00:29:12.189
They sort of coggle it or they have all kinds
of germination inside like the pond, which

00:29:12.189 --> 00:29:18.010
is absolutely bound, it is not flowing like
river.

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:29.240
So like that, you see, it becomes a kind of
a closed mind with these maryadas.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:36.570
And when you have this maryadas, you start
thinking, “Whether I should do it or not;

00:29:36.570 --> 00:29:39.260
whether I’ll enjoy it or not.”

00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:44.210
With these maryadas only, you kill the joy.

00:29:44.210 --> 00:29:50.310
Now we have other maryadas about, say, we
have country … as I said about the religion.

00:29:50.310 --> 00:29:57.180
Now many people who love to come to Sahaj
Yoga, but because they have maryadas of silly

00:29:57.180 --> 00:30:01.330
things of their religion, they cannot come.

00:30:01.330 --> 00:30:05.210
They think, “This is our religion,” while
they don’t understand.

00:30:05.210 --> 00:30:12.610
Falsehood becomes the maryadas and they don’t
understand that what is the maryada actually

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:15.720
made by the religion also.

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:18.280
You see now in Islam what is happening is.

00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:26.590
With these maryadas, they want to have another
country, this thing, that thing.

00:30:26.590 --> 00:30:30.050
In other Christian religion also same thing
happening.

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.710
Also in Hindu religion.

00:30:31.710 --> 00:30:38.439
All these maryadas are really stagnating them
completely, and they are getting crushed into

00:30:38.439 --> 00:30:39.559
it.

00:30:39.559 --> 00:30:42.920
There’s no discretion.

00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:46.600
Because they have said it, they do it.

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:53.290
They are so much blind-folded about it, that
they cannot see what is right and what is

00:30:53.290 --> 00:30:54.290
wrong.

00:30:54.290 --> 00:30:59.980
But after Sahaj, you can see, you can laugh
at them and you can see.

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:05.350
Then we have social maryadas.

00:31:05.350 --> 00:31:12.460
Social maryadas are there which are sometimes,
when abandoned can become very horrid also.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:19.790
Like in the West now, the women think that
the less dress they wear, the more beautiful

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.790
they are.

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:23.160
This is a new thing they have started.

00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:25.260
Now this absurd.

00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:32.770
If you see the discretion behind is very simple:
that we have been animals and now we don’t

00:31:32.770 --> 00:31:38.330
want to have any clothes because we were animals.

00:31:38.330 --> 00:31:44.730
Is a animal heritage that if … that’s
why so many women do not want to wear full

00:31:44.730 --> 00:31:45.730
dresses.

00:31:45.730 --> 00:31:48.370
It’s just animal behavior.

00:31:48.370 --> 00:31:55.300
So the maryada of – good maryadas also people
can give up saying that “We don’t want

00:31:55.300 --> 00:31:56.300
any maryadas.

00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.870
We are free; we can do whatever we like.”

00:31:58.870 --> 00:32:03.440
But in that freedom what do you achieve?

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:10.750
Your animal instinct works in that freedom
and you think you are a very free personality.

00:32:10.750 --> 00:32:13.400
Then we have maryadas of our country.

00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.340
God has not made different, different countries
at all.

00:32:17.340 --> 00:32:21.920
Nor it is true there are different countries,
but variety is there.

00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:26.140
Variety of people, variety of places is there.

00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:34.380
These varieties must be accepted as something
very artistic and one should not get ruined

00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:41.450
and confused with those ideas that “We are
Americans, we are Indians, we are this and

00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:42.610
we are that.”

00:32:42.610 --> 00:32:43.610
You’re not.

00:32:43.610 --> 00:32:49.070
Now you can know after Sahaja Yoga, that you
are all Sahaja yogis and you don’t belong

00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.309
to any country as such.

00:32:51.309 --> 00:32:54.679
The country may belong to you, but you don’t
belong to the country.

00:32:54.679 --> 00:33:03.200
I mean the work is today to understand that
if you really want to care for all these countries

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:11.570
and all that, then you must do some work – work
of Sahaja Yoga so that people get rid of these

00:33:11.570 --> 00:33:17.260
silly ideas of fighting for territory, for
this, for that.

00:33:17.260 --> 00:33:22.850
All over the world there’s going on, “We
want this land; we want that land.”

00:33:22.850 --> 00:33:26.530
Land belongs to God, not to human beings.

00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.059
And what is the use of fighting for land?

00:33:29.059 --> 00:33:30.850
I don’t understand.

00:33:30.850 --> 00:33:33.930
But this confusion is there and illusion is
there.

00:33:33.930 --> 00:33:39.270
And people work out on this confusion and
illusion to such an extent that they ruin

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:41.750
their lives, the lives of their children.

00:33:41.750 --> 00:33:49.750
So many people are lost, so many people are
in the lunatic asylum, I should say, because

00:33:49.750 --> 00:33:53.670
they end up in some sort of a refugee camp.

00:33:53.670 --> 00:33:58.160
They are having a good house, nicely living
there.

00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.480
Then you become a refugee.

00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:01.980
Why?

00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:10.060
Because they believe that they can have their
own land, they can have their own place and

00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:12.150
they should live there.

00:34:12.150 --> 00:34:18.700
This idea comes, I think, from some stupid
leaders who want to have for themselves these

00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.040
lands and that’s how people fight for land.

00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:29.141
There’s no need to fight for land or fight
for your country or fight for this or fight

00:34:29.141 --> 00:34:30.410
for that.

00:34:30.410 --> 00:34:37.559
But the situation is such that unless and
until you fight, you cannot get to the truth.

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:45.140
And that’s why if you remember that Shri
Krishna told Arjuna that “You fight.

00:34:45.140 --> 00:34:46.140
Fight.

00:34:46.140 --> 00:34:48.189
You have to fight, that’s your work.

00:34:48.189 --> 00:34:54.210
You have to fight these people, because they
are the people who do not live with dharma.

00:34:54.210 --> 00:34:58.230
They are adharmis, so you have to fight.”

00:34:58.230 --> 00:35:06.439
And that is how his fighting was so much justified,
because after fighting the war they got back

00:35:06.439 --> 00:35:08.210
what they deserved.

00:35:08.210 --> 00:35:16.210
They were deceived, and this is what Shri
Krishna said that “You should not by any

00:35:16.210 --> 00:35:25.640
chance become a slave of these people, but
you fight it back.”

00:35:25.640 --> 00:35:30.740
So fighting also is justified in the divine
discretion.

00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:36.559
Is again the divine discretion where you have
to fight because you don’t want to be a

00:35:36.559 --> 00:35:37.610
slave.

00:35:37.610 --> 00:35:40.059
If you are a slave, you are no good.

00:35:40.059 --> 00:35:41.970
So for that you can fight.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:50.250
But when people start fighting for separation
of a territory, is not correct.

00:35:50.250 --> 00:35:55.330
On the contrary, one should never think of
separating from the main lands.

00:35:55.330 --> 00:35:59.309
Because it creates lots of problems.

00:35:59.309 --> 00:36:03.100
But now we believe in the global religion.

00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:05.920
We believe in the global territory.

00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.240
We don’t have to ask for anything.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:11.820
Anywhere you go, you are the citizen of that
place.

00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:17.370
Anybody who wants to go to Russia ever, the
whole Russians will be with you.

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:20.350
You go to America, they’ll be with you.

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:26.200
That’s how because all these are ideas of
human beings, and if the human beings get

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:34.600
transformed there will be no problem of any
war or any territory to be achieved.

00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:42.090
This was the divine Discretion of Shri Krishna,
which is instilled within us.

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:52.850
As you know that this is a part and parcel
of the Vishuddhi Chakra, where Shri Krishna

00:36:52.850 --> 00:37:02.870
resides; but when He rises to your Sahasrara,
when He rises to that level, then He becomes

00:37:02.870 --> 00:37:05.800
Virata.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:18.910
So Virata’s Chakra is placed in the head,
here above the Agnya, and this Virat is the

00:37:18.910 --> 00:37:26.260
form of Shri Krishna who has risen above the
Agnya.

00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:35.200
When you are risen above the Agnya, you become
a part and parcel of Virata’s land, we can

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.610
say.

00:37:36.610 --> 00:37:45.330
Because, unless and until you are above your
ego, you are still involved with yourself

00:37:45.330 --> 00:37:49.100
and with wrong ideas of maryadas.

00:37:49.100 --> 00:37:56.110
But when you rise above that and you become
the Virat, the great, then you are in the

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.540
land of Virata.

00:37:58.540 --> 00:38:01.580
And Virata’s powers are tremendous.

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:05.980
Has been seen by Arjuna – the form of Virat.

00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:12.880
The power of Virat becomes so tremendous that
it acts globally.

00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:25.860
It acts in such a manner that you sit here
and anywhere it can act.

00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:26.900
You have seen that now.

00:38:26.900 --> 00:38:30.860
Many a times people say, “Mother it’s
a miracle.

00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:38.429
My mother was sick and she was not here and
I just prayed and she got all right.”

00:38:38.429 --> 00:38:42.400
This is all the power of Virat.

00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:50.980
The power of Virata is that it can penetrate
into the subtle side of human beings in such

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:54.910
a manner that everything we are connected
with.

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.600
We are not separate.

00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.030
And every drop is connected with the ocean.

00:39:00.030 --> 00:39:04.080
We are connected with the whole universe.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:15.851
And when you become a citizens, I should say,
of Virat, then all the things with which you

00:39:15.851 --> 00:39:27.380
are connected also get your vibrations, your
ideas, your ambitions.

00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:32.720
Everything passes through that and it works
– it works.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:37.720
You have seen how many miracles have taken
place in your lives.

00:39:37.720 --> 00:39:41.630
It is the Virata Shakti that works.

00:39:41.630 --> 00:39:51.320
Now for that we have to know how to do worship
of Virata.

00:39:51.320 --> 00:39:59.390
First of all you have to rise above your ego
– very important.

00:39:59.390 --> 00:40:02.429
Otherwise how can you worship?

00:40:02.429 --> 00:40:12.809
There is your ego standing in between and
how can you rise up to the point of Virat?

00:40:12.809 --> 00:40:16.030
You have to pass through that.

00:40:16.030 --> 00:40:23.820
Once you are above your ego, you enter into
the kingdom of Virata.

00:40:23.820 --> 00:40:33.260
There the King is the Virat and you are the
subject who are looked after completely by

00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:36.870
Virata Shakti, by the power of Virata.

00:40:36.870 --> 00:40:44.100
But at that stage you become really a universal
personality, in a way, because whatever are

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:51.530
problems universally – now not necessarily
that they should be attached to you or connected

00:40:51.530 --> 00:40:53.400
to you.

00:40:53.400 --> 00:40:55.730
Supposing a person is of that level.

00:40:55.730 --> 00:41:03.870
Now there may be a war in some other country
– it can stop.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:09.000
Somebody who is being oppressed can win over.

00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:12.190
Anywhere your compassion moves it works out.

00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.790
Whenever your attention will go, it will work
out.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:20.680
And sometimes you are surprised as to how
it works, “Mother, how these things work

00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:21.680
out?

00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:26.450
How coincidences … how these coincidences
have taken place?”

00:41:26.450 --> 00:41:34.470
Only thing is you have crossed that state
of your ego and have gone into the state of

00:41:34.470 --> 00:41:43.179
Virat, which is a very important thing to
do – is to enter into the area of Virata.

00:41:43.179 --> 00:41:45.549
Then you don’t think, “This is your country.

00:41:45.549 --> 00:41:47.929
This belongs to you, that belongs to you.”

00:41:47.929 --> 00:41:50.760
This belonging business finishes off.

00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.030
Then you belong to Virat.

00:41:53.030 --> 00:42:01.380
And He uses you for His own purpose in the
sense that when your whole thinking is different

00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:06.720
– becomes global thinking, then He acts.

00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:09.100
And then His powers are many-fold.

00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:16.549
And Krishna’s power is that He uses a conch
to call people.

00:42:16.549 --> 00:42:19.929
I have given conches to all the leaders.

00:42:19.929 --> 00:42:25.600
So we have to now announce and call people.

00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:33.549
But at the level of Virat, you don’t have
to do all that.

00:42:33.549 --> 00:42:41.690
At the level of Virat it just – people see,
they’ll know.

00:42:41.690 --> 00:42:46.720
Just they will watch you and they will know.

00:42:46.720 --> 00:42:53.620
Just they will think you are human beings
and you are so sweet, so good, just like gems

00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:55.180
shining all the time.

00:42:55.180 --> 00:42:58.410
So, they’ll be impressed.

00:42:58.410 --> 00:43:00.850
This comes through the Virata’s blessing.

00:43:00.850 --> 00:43:09.130
When you become that, then you forget about
other things like you have big positions or

00:43:09.130 --> 00:43:16.210
anything, you come from a very rich family
or that – all these nonsensical things which

00:43:16.210 --> 00:43:18.720
are actually not true.

00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:25.309
And all these things on which you want to
exist are no more.

00:43:25.309 --> 00:43:35.770
People like to show off their wealth, some
people like to be very sort of demonstrative

00:43:35.770 --> 00:43:41.160
of what they think they are.

00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:49.530
But in the case of a person who rises above
his ego, and he’s a part and parcel of that

00:43:49.530 --> 00:43:56.570
Virata shakti, enters into the kingdom of
Virata, he knows he is very small.

00:43:56.570 --> 00:44:04.110
He is very small compared to that and he just
dissolves into that Shakti.

00:44:04.110 --> 00:44:07.689
And this should happen to us that we should
humble down.

00:44:07.689 --> 00:44:17.911
We should humble down and know that our powers,
whatever we have, if they give us ego, we

00:44:17.911 --> 00:44:19.730
should get rid of it.

00:44:19.730 --> 00:44:21.730
We should not have that ego.

00:44:21.730 --> 00:44:29.860
We should get rid of it and we should actually
achieve that state where you can be called

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:32.110
as citizens of the Virata’s Power.

00:44:35.920 --> 00:44:37.630
May God bless you all.

00:46:41.706 --> 00:46:45.305
Now when you are entering into the kingdom
of Virata, you have to be like children.

00:46:46.176 --> 00:46:48.126
You are children there.

00:46:48.676 --> 00:46:50.616
As children you enter.

00:46:50.986 --> 00:47:01.436
As Christ has said, “When you enter into
the Kingdom of God you have to be like children.”

00:47:01.476 --> 00:47:07.826
And that’s what you have to be today, all
of you to be innocent like children.

00:47:07.876 --> 00:47:10.806
You have to be innocent like children.
