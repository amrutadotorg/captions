00:00:05.933 --> 00:00:13.533
I would say with this, today’s
special celebration of Navaratri.

00:00:13.613 --> 00:00:20.594
Like yesterday you saw the Durga’s nine forms also.

00:00:20.674 --> 00:00:22.244
In that is one is Kushmanda.

00:00:22.324 --> 00:00:30.694
As this was told that you absorb all
the filth within yourself, in your stomach.

00:00:30.774 --> 00:00:33.484
But Devi does that, not you.

00:00:33.564 --> 00:00:37.554
What a Devi can do, you should not do.

00:00:37.634 --> 00:00:42.984
That’s Her job, that She’s
supposed to do these things, not you.

00:00:43.064 --> 00:00:52.623
What you have to do is to only be in silence
so that you absorb whatever will increase

00:00:52.703 --> 00:00:56.464
that silence, will increase your depth.

00:00:56.544 --> 00:01:00.403
Devi will look after all the other, rest of the things.

00:01:00.483 --> 00:01:08.353
She will look after the, all the filth, all
the anger, all the temper, all the everything

00:01:08.433 --> 00:01:10.534
that’s going on in this world.

00:01:10.614 --> 00:01:18.714
She will absorb all that, but what you
have to do is to just enjoy everything that is

00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:19.774
pure.

00:01:19.854 --> 00:01:23.694
Enjoyment is only possible when you are beyond your mind.

00:01:23.774 --> 00:01:26.353
With your mind you can never enjoy.

00:01:26.433 --> 00:01:28.924
It’s like a big load.

00:01:29.004 --> 00:01:31.284
It will not act, it will not help.

00:01:31.364 --> 00:01:40.194
Enjoyment comes when you are in
complete silence, in a rippleless lake.

00:01:40.274 --> 00:01:46.974
The reflection of all the joy that is created
on the shores of that lake are completely

00:01:47.054 --> 00:01:49.524
reflected, they are not deflected.

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:54.694
If there were ripples it would have been a
different image altogether and would have

00:01:54.774 --> 00:02:01.564
been something nowhere near the image of reality.

00:02:01.644 --> 00:02:10.014
So one must have a mind which is kept lower than reality.

00:02:10.094 --> 00:02:16.784
In the reality actually it is nothing but peace and joy.

00:02:16.864 --> 00:02:24.524
Now a mother’s desire is always that children
should have nothing but peace and joy, no

00:02:24.604 --> 00:02:29.814
sufferings, no starvation, no ordeals, nothing.

00:02:29.894 --> 00:02:33.154
They must just enjoy.

00:02:33.234 --> 00:02:35.204
Now those days are gone.

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:47.363
But even to enjoy this, even to live in that
complete peaceful state you have to be non-reflecting.

00:02:47.443 --> 00:03:01.244
Now you watch yourself, you’ll be
amazed how much reflecting you are.

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:03.494
When Devi is doing all the job for you.

00:03:03.574 --> 00:03:12.194
When Paramchaitanya, I don’t know how
many things It is doing, is trying to fill up the

00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:15.893
whole atmosphere with It’s activity.

00:03:15.973 --> 00:03:21.364
What is your activity, should
be to stop your mental activity.

00:03:21.444 --> 00:03:26.534
You’ll be amazed in that state only, you will grow.

00:03:26.614 --> 00:03:31.834
With that growth only you will become like this scientist.

00:03:31.914 --> 00:03:40.454
How the contradiction now is that when you
have your depth you can project your depth,

00:03:40.534 --> 00:03:42.294
not your mind.

00:03:42.374 --> 00:03:47.074
Sometimes when I say “project,”
people think it is a projection of the mind.

00:03:47.154 --> 00:03:53.314
No. you have to project that
depth, that reality that is within you.

00:03:53.394 --> 00:03:59.014
For that you don’t have to think,
you don’t have to plan, it will just work.

00:03:59.094 --> 00:04:02.484
But you’ll be the instrument for that projection.

00:04:02.564 --> 00:04:05.474
It is nothing subtle.

00:04:05.554 --> 00:04:08.744
It is very simple to understand.

00:04:08.824 --> 00:04:12.924
Like I’m talking on this instrument, all right?

00:04:13.004 --> 00:04:23.924
Now if this instrument is absolutely all right,
there’s no problem in it, it will be peaceful.

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:34.004
But if this is full of ideas and thoughts
like our brain is, whatever I’m saying will

00:04:34.084 --> 00:04:38.754
not be the same that will be broadcasted.

00:04:38.834 --> 00:04:46.204
In the same way, when our mind is full of
turmoil and arguments and what you can say,

00:04:46.284 --> 00:04:54.843
comments, or we can also say the reflection,
then what happens is that this mind gets into

00:04:54.923 --> 00:05:13.324
like a whirlpool of disturbances and it
cannot project itself fully because it is disturbed.

00:05:13.404 --> 00:05:16.314
It is not a normal thing.

00:05:16.394 --> 00:05:19.724
So now you’ll understand there is no contradiction.

00:05:19.804 --> 00:05:25.403
You can only project yourself
when you are absolutely peaceful.

00:05:25.483 --> 00:05:28.269
And this is what we have to learn.
