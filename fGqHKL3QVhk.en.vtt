00:00:20.592 --> 00:00:35.821
Last night was a night of complete darkness,
that they call it as amavasya; and just now

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:41.302
only the first phase of the moon has started.

00:00:41.302 --> 00:00:56.362
Today we are here to celebrate the day when
the Sahastrara was opened out.

00:00:56.362 --> 00:01:01.441
Also you have seen in the photograph.

00:01:01.441 --> 00:01:10.242
It was actually a photograph of my brain,
which showed how the Sahastrara was opened

00:01:10.242 --> 00:01:11.292
out.

00:01:11.292 --> 00:01:16.272
The light of the brain now could be photographed.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:20.811
It’s something great these modern times
have done.

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:26.742
So the modern times have brought a lot of
things which can prove the existence of the

00:01:26.742 --> 00:01:28.732
Divine.

00:01:28.732 --> 00:01:36.292
Also it can prove about me.

00:01:36.292 --> 00:01:41.892
It can convince you what I am.

00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:53.262
This is very important because, in the modern
times, this advent has to be recognised, has

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:54.592
to be fully recognised.

00:01:54.592 --> 00:02:00.102
This is one of the conditions for all the
Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:00.102 --> 00:02:10.152
Now let’s see what’s happening in the
modern times, in the brains of the people.

00:02:10.152 --> 00:02:20.262
In the brains of the people today, if you
see, there is an attack on the Sahastrara.

00:02:20.262 --> 00:02:27.902
There has been an attack since long but in
the modern times it’s the worst time.

00:02:27.902 --> 00:02:42.152
They are trying to make the limbic area very
insensitive.

00:02:42.152 --> 00:03:00.672
Very depressive novels, very depressive thoughts
and very depressive music, you can say, like

00:03:00.672 --> 00:03:02.782
Greek tragedy nonsense.

00:03:02.782 --> 00:03:21.821
All these things came from the medieval period
till, we should say, this new age has started.

00:03:21.821 --> 00:03:26.692
That one itself was no good for our limbic
area.

00:03:26.692 --> 00:03:29.961
That made us very depressive.

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:43.252
We took to alcoholism to escape from the so-called
miseries.

00:03:43.252 --> 00:03:57.782
But then came this modern age in which people
became overactive – over-activity started.

00:03:57.782 --> 00:04:06.142
With that the brain also became overactive.

00:04:06.142 --> 00:04:15.702
In addition to the dullness before, it’s
gone to the other extreme of over-activity.

00:04:15.702 --> 00:04:26.661
So to dull it again they took to drugs, they
took to very horrible music.

00:04:26.661 --> 00:04:34.722
That’s how they made this limbic area very,
very insensitive.

00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:47.312
So a drug which was just a stimulus to begin
with was to be taken in greater quantity and

00:04:47.312 --> 00:04:56.611
later on they had to take the drugs which
were of a much more severe nature.

00:04:56.611 --> 00:05:03.212
It went on like that and now we know that
this drug is the only way people think they

00:05:03.212 --> 00:05:06.372
can survive.

00:05:06.372 --> 00:05:09.111
Why?

00:05:09.111 --> 00:05:11.351
Because of the tension [that] they talk of.

00:05:11.351 --> 00:05:15.492
In the modern times we have something called
‘tensions’.

00:05:15.492 --> 00:05:17.062
It was never there before.

00:05:17.062 --> 00:05:19.342
People never talked of their tensions.

00:05:19.342 --> 00:05:22.382
Now every body says, “I’m in a tension!”

00:05:22.382 --> 00:05:24.582
“You give me a tension!”

00:05:24.582 --> 00:05:27.142
What is this tension?

00:05:27.142 --> 00:05:31.602
It’s because of my advent.

00:05:31.602 --> 00:05:40.141
The limbic area wants to know about me.

00:05:40.141 --> 00:05:49.623
And the Kundalini also, as Sahaja Yoga is
increasing, is trying to rise in people; because

00:05:49.623 --> 00:05:51.861
you become the channels.

00:05:51.861 --> 00:06:05.632
Wherever you go, you generate vibrations,
and these vibrations give a challenge to the

00:06:05.632 --> 00:06:12.641
Kundalini, or a message, and in various people
it rises.

00:06:12.641 --> 00:06:18.861
It may not rise up to the Sahastrara, or it
may even rise up to Sahastrara but it falls

00:06:18.861 --> 00:06:22.641
back, because there’s no recognition.

00:06:22.641 --> 00:06:29.611
So every time they do something, this Kundalini
comes up and gives them a pressure, because

00:06:29.611 --> 00:06:35.351
their Sahastrara is not open.

00:06:35.351 --> 00:06:36.791
It’s a closed door.

00:06:36.791 --> 00:06:43.201
Because of the closed door this gives them
a kind of a pressure in the head, which they

00:06:43.201 --> 00:06:47.872
don’t understand, and they call it as ‘tension’.

00:06:47.872 --> 00:06:55.522
Actually the Kundalini is trying to push it
out, itself, but it cannot.

00:06:55.522 --> 00:07:04.161
And those also who get their Realisation,
if they do not make their Sahastrara alright,

00:07:04.161 --> 00:07:07.671
they go on getting into tensions.

00:07:07.671 --> 00:07:22.821
So, though Sahastrara has been opened out
so many years back, still we have some things

00:07:22.821 --> 00:07:28.652
to be done – is to clear out our Sahastrara,
first of all.

00:07:28.652 --> 00:07:40.242
So first is the breaking of the Sahastrara,
then once it opened out, the brahmarandhra

00:07:40.242 --> 00:07:58.002
opened out, then we started feeling the grace,
and it moved onto our Ida and Pingala – the

00:07:58.002 --> 00:08:02.361
grace not the Kundalini.

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:11.911
And the grace, which is chaitanya, all round,
soothed down our Left and Right sides by which

00:08:11.911 --> 00:08:21.141
our chakras opened more, and more threads
of the Kundalini started piercing through.

00:08:21.141 --> 00:08:28.262
So I always tell Sahaja Yogis that it’s
important that you must meditate.

00:08:28.262 --> 00:08:35.321
If your Sahastrara is alright, all your chakras
will be alright because, as you know, that

00:08:35.321 --> 00:08:43.082
the peethas, or the controlling centres of
all these chakras, are in the brain around

00:08:43.082 --> 00:08:46.002
the limbic area.

00:08:46.002 --> 00:08:55.922
So if your Sahastrara is clear everything
works out in a very different way.

00:08:55.922 --> 00:09:02.662
How to keep the Sahastrara alright, is the
big problem [which] always people ask me.

00:09:02.662 --> 00:09:05.212
You know that I reside in the Sahastrara.

00:09:05.212 --> 00:09:12.782
I have incarnated on the lotus of one thousand
petals.

00:09:12.782 --> 00:09:18.861
That’s why I could break it also.

00:09:18.861 --> 00:09:22.422
As I am today, as you see me.

00:09:22.422 --> 00:09:27.192
Of course they say, “Sahastrare Mahamaya”
(सहस्त्रारे महामाया)

00:09:27.192 --> 00:09:37.311
So this is the illusion which is all the time
there for you, which is very elusive.

00:09:37.311 --> 00:09:44.801
It had to be that way because you could not
have faced me otherwise with all the lights

00:09:44.801 --> 00:09:56.382
coming out of me or the way you saw yesterday
Sahastrara – some sort of abstract colours

00:09:56.382 --> 00:09:59.552
thrown on all sides and the lights thrown
outside.

00:09:59.552 --> 00:10:04.722
Please don’t take photographs when I’m
speaking, alright?

00:10:04.722 --> 00:10:05.722
You can take later on.

00:10:05.722 --> 00:10:06.722
There’s no hurry about.

00:10:06.722 --> 00:10:09.192
Just pay attention to My lecture.

00:10:09.192 --> 00:10:11.592
Please, pay attention.

00:10:11.592 --> 00:10:13.192
It’s important.

00:10:13.192 --> 00:10:20.052
It is to be, this, told beforehand, that nobody
should take photographs during puja because

00:10:20.052 --> 00:10:24.662
it is a very intense thing [that] one has
to work it out.

00:10:24.662 --> 00:10:26.762
Please, pay attention.

00:10:26.762 --> 00:10:30.942
Even if you don’t understand, it has effect
on you.

00:10:30.942 --> 00:10:40.722
So I would request you to pay full attention
to me when I am talking.

00:10:40.722 --> 00:10:42.922
It works better.

00:10:42.922 --> 00:10:50.811
Now this Sahastrara is to be looked after
by you.

00:10:50.811 --> 00:10:56.282
It’s the temple of your Mother.

00:10:56.282 --> 00:11:01.042
When you say you put me in the heart, actually
you put me in the Sahastrara.

00:11:01.042 --> 00:11:06.371
Because, as you know, the brahmarandhra here
(Shri Mataji touches her brahmarandhra) is

00:11:06.371 --> 00:11:14.202
the fontanel bone area, has got the peetha,
the centre, which controls the heart, which

00:11:14.202 --> 00:11:24.352
is the seat of the Sadashiva or you can say
of Shiva.

00:11:24.352 --> 00:11:29.592
So when you put me in the heart actually you
put me there.

00:11:29.592 --> 00:11:37.311
So to raise it from heart to there, or to
bring it from there to the heart, is the problem

00:11:37.311 --> 00:11:44.702
of two types of people.

00:11:44.702 --> 00:11:53.561
Some people who are sensitive in their heart
– I would say in Europe we can say Italians

00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:57.263
are very sensitive on their heart – the
first thing they do as soon as they see me

00:11:57.263 --> 00:12:05.032
they put their hands to their heart.

00:12:05.032 --> 00:12:13.792
And that is what it is, that, if you try to
feel me in your heart, to begin with, it’s

00:12:13.792 --> 00:12:15.692
much easier.

00:12:15.692 --> 00:12:18.852
To feel me in your heart.

00:12:18.852 --> 00:12:30.551
Now you might say, “How to do it?”

00:12:30.551 --> 00:12:37.562
You have to love me as I love you.

00:12:37.562 --> 00:12:46.392
You have to love each one of yourselves, because
you are all within me.

00:12:46.392 --> 00:12:52.181
And you cannot teach someone how to love.

00:12:52.181 --> 00:12:53.551
Love is within.

00:12:53.551 --> 00:13:01.832
And love manifests if, just, you open your
heart.

00:13:01.832 --> 00:13:08.501
Now what stops it, we should examine that.

00:13:08.501 --> 00:13:11.692
Firstly, the conditioning.

00:13:11.692 --> 00:13:19.241
In the West to express your love is regarded
as sinful actually.

00:13:19.241 --> 00:13:25.082
It takes them time to say, “I love you,”
but “I hate you!” even a child could go

00:13:25.082 --> 00:13:26.952
on saying, “I hate you!

00:13:26.952 --> 00:13:28.072
I hate you!

00:13:28.072 --> 00:13:29.202
I hate you!”

00:13:29.202 --> 00:13:31.152
But to hate someone is sinful.

00:13:31.152 --> 00:13:36.361
To anyone, to hate, is sinful.

00:13:36.361 --> 00:13:37.361
So to say that, “I hate you!

00:13:37.361 --> 00:13:45.452
I hate you!” is a sinful act.

00:13:45.452 --> 00:13:57.061
So what one has to do is to say, [to] go on
saying, “I love you."

00:13:57.061 --> 00:14:05.992
After all, you must love a person who is so
dear to you.

00:14:05.992 --> 00:14:15.352
Anyone who has done something good for you,
you love that person.

00:14:15.352 --> 00:14:22.632
But if the Adi Shakti Herself has given you
the rebirth, it should be the easiest thing

00:14:22.632 --> 00:14:27.702
to love.

00:14:27.702 --> 00:14:36.952
And if She says that, “They are all within
my body,” so it should be even easier to

00:14:36.952 --> 00:14:39.842
love each other.

00:14:39.842 --> 00:14:53.142
So the whole cleansing of the Sahastrara is
done through this love, this love which is

00:14:53.142 --> 00:15:06.462
not conditioned, which is not inhibited, which
doesn’t want any respite or doesn’t want

00:15:06.462 --> 00:15:10.772
any return – nirvaaj.

00:15:10.772 --> 00:15:16.171
But the conditionings are too much.

00:15:16.171 --> 00:15:24.491
First the problem of conditioning comes to
you when you think that, “This condition

00:15:24.491 --> 00:15:36.162
makes me hate someone,” or, “I cannot
love someone because this is the condition!”

00:15:36.162 --> 00:15:47.202
But actually the conditioning itself is so
absurd, if you see it one by one.

00:15:47.202 --> 00:15:58.652
To make it simple, I would like you to understand
the conditioning part where I read once an

00:15:58.652 --> 00:16:03.871
article, an interesting one, “Who killed
the romance?”

00:16:03.871 --> 00:16:06.592
So he said “the hairdressers”.

00:16:06.592 --> 00:16:13.001
I was wondering how is he connecting romance
with the hairdressers?

00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:21.582
Because people used to go to a hairdresser
and one hairdressing was liked by a person.

00:16:21.582 --> 00:16:25.652
So he would say that, “I love that hairdressing!”

00:16:25.652 --> 00:16:33.871
Now supposing his fiancée, or his wife wore
another type of hairdressing, because everyday

00:16:33.871 --> 00:16:42.172
new things are coming, then immediately the
husband would say, “Oh I hate you because

00:16:42.172 --> 00:16:46.372
of your hairdressing!”

00:16:46.372 --> 00:16:50.702
Because he loves one type of hair dress, that’s
why he loves.

00:16:50.702 --> 00:16:53.122
Otherwise if you have another hair dress you
hate it!

00:16:53.122 --> 00:16:55.952
“I don’t like it!”

00:16:55.952 --> 00:17:03.572
To say that “I don’t like it” and “I
like it”, itself, is a sign that the conditioning

00:17:03.572 --> 00:17:08.192
is too much.

00:17:08.192 --> 00:17:13.842
You make a proper hair dress and you dress
up properly and you come out and then suddenly

00:17:13.842 --> 00:17:18.692
people say, ”Oh I hate it!”

00:17:18.692 --> 00:17:19.952
Who are you?

00:17:19.952 --> 00:17:23.921
What right we have got to say that to anyone?

00:17:23.921 --> 00:17:31.262
You are not a judge appointed by any law courts.

00:17:31.262 --> 00:17:40.472
So why do we say, to hurt someone, to say
“I hate it”?

00:17:40.472 --> 00:17:46.452
On the contrary you must say that, “Alright,
I like this but you could do better."

00:17:46.452 --> 00:17:54.992
That’s the sign of love when you want a
person to be dressed up in a way that is appealing.

00:17:54.992 --> 00:18:04.312
But this is on a very, very baser level that
we see people.

00:18:04.312 --> 00:18:15.011
Then we go further to see a person: how intelligent
he is, how smart he is, how charismatic he

00:18:15.011 --> 00:18:23.982
is, how charming – that’s another word
which is very elusive.

00:18:23.982 --> 00:18:29.502
These are also kind of conditionings of the
mind that you think that a particular style

00:18:29.502 --> 00:18:39.651
of a person is a loveable person, that you
love that person.

00:18:39.651 --> 00:18:43.442
It’s so much outside.

00:18:43.442 --> 00:18:48.281
Or some people actually do not love but show
they love because somebody has more money.

00:18:48.281 --> 00:18:53.812
And the money, he’s not going to part with,
no doubt, but you love that person because

00:18:53.812 --> 00:19:02.862
he has more money, or he has a better car
or he’s better dressed, whatever it is.

00:19:02.862 --> 00:19:12.242
So this kind of an idea one has also is a
killer of love.

00:19:12.242 --> 00:19:18.901
If love is killed, the joy is lost, you cannot
have joy without love.

00:19:18.901 --> 00:19:27.622
I say, joy and love, both are just the same.

00:19:27.622 --> 00:19:32.031
Then it gets even subtler and subtler and
subtler.

00:19:32.031 --> 00:19:39.182
Then we start loving our own children, that’s
very common.

00:19:39.182 --> 00:19:45.401
I mean, of course, also some people don’t
even love their children, I mean there are

00:19:45.401 --> 00:19:48.621
all kinds, you see.

00:19:48.621 --> 00:19:53.362
But then they go on, “This is my child,
this is my child, this is my child!”

00:19:53.362 --> 00:20:04.612
That again is the death of love.

00:20:04.612 --> 00:20:11.031
As I told you before: the sap of the tree
rises, goes to every fruit, goes to every

00:20:11.031 --> 00:20:14.322
leaf, goes to every part and comes back.

00:20:14.322 --> 00:20:15.792
It’s not attached.

00:20:15.792 --> 00:20:25.012
If you are attached to one part or to one
flower because it is more beautiful then the

00:20:25.012 --> 00:20:29.832
tree will die and the flower will also die.

00:20:29.832 --> 00:20:35.151
So that’s the death of the love.

00:20:35.151 --> 00:20:43.052
So you have to have love which doesn’t get
entangled or attached.

00:20:43.052 --> 00:20:44.572
Every time I tell like this they say, “How
to do it?”

00:20:44.572 --> 00:20:52.131
The love of the Spirit is of that kind.

00:20:52.131 --> 00:20:58.881
Love of conditioned mind is different.

00:20:58.881 --> 00:21:08.212
A conditioned mind can love in a limited way
because it is conditioned.

00:21:08.212 --> 00:21:18.472
Then the greatest enemy of love is ego within
us, which is like a balloon on top of our

00:21:18.472 --> 00:21:19.472
head.

00:21:19.472 --> 00:21:25.901
And this ego gives us a very big tension.

00:21:25.901 --> 00:21:33.712
The conditioning of course, like they see
a carpet.

00:21:33.712 --> 00:21:39.302
Now it is, according to their conditioning,
is not good.

00:21:39.302 --> 00:21:42.642
So they say, “Oh what a carpet it is!”

00:21:42.642 --> 00:21:43.642
Or something.

00:21:43.642 --> 00:21:49.312
This kind of conditioning of very low level.

00:21:49.312 --> 00:21:53.982
And the higher level at the most, is that
you love your own country, so “My country

00:21:53.982 --> 00:21:54.982
is the best!”

00:21:54.982 --> 00:22:02.261
Whether it is killing people, whether it is
destroying the world peace, it’s all right

00:22:02.261 --> 00:22:04.972
because “I belong to a particular country
which is the best!”

00:22:04.972 --> 00:22:09.552
We can never criticise our country and countrymen.

00:22:09.552 --> 00:22:14.052
It goes on subtler and subtler.

00:22:14.052 --> 00:22:18.612
But on the intelligence side it is even worse!

00:22:18.612 --> 00:22:26.162
Because intelligently if you have understood
that something is good then nobody can save

00:22:26.162 --> 00:22:29.072
you!

00:22:29.072 --> 00:22:31.842
Because through your brain you have understood.

00:22:31.842 --> 00:22:40.852
Actually it is very surprising: I was reading
the book written by Rabindranath Tagore and

00:22:40.852 --> 00:22:51.662
an Englishman had given a very beautiful preface
to that, an introduction, and he said that

00:22:51.662 --> 00:22:57.042
the creativity is killed in the West.

00:22:57.042 --> 00:23:03.222
So he asked a gentleman who was an Indian
critic.

00:23:03.222 --> 00:23:06.032
He said, “Don’t you criticise your poets?

00:23:06.032 --> 00:23:09.932
You don’t have people who are critics?”

00:23:09.932 --> 00:23:16.062
“Yes, yes we have, they criticise,” “So
what do they criticise?”

00:23:16.062 --> 00:23:24.271
“Oh, they can criticise that, this time
there was no rain so we had problems and things."

00:23:24.271 --> 00:23:27.281
He said: “No, no, no, no!

00:23:27.281 --> 00:23:32.682
We are thinking about the poet, do they criticise
the poet, do they criticise an artist?”

00:23:32.682 --> 00:23:37.882
So he says: “Is it meant for criticism?”

00:23:37.882 --> 00:23:44.352
“It is created, whatever he felt is created.

00:23:44.352 --> 00:23:50.732
But supposing he has put something very vulgar
then of course we don’t like it.

00:23:50.732 --> 00:23:54.832
But if it is created by a beautiful mind,
it has to be beautiful."

00:23:54.832 --> 00:23:57.072
“Then you don’t criticise?”

00:23:57.072 --> 00:24:01.131
He says, “No, because we cannot create like
that.

00:24:01.131 --> 00:24:09.702
So what business have you got to criticise?”

00:24:09.702 --> 00:24:15.342
This is how, ‘intelligently’, what we
have done: we have norms about everything,

00:24:15.342 --> 00:24:17.572
about art about every creation.

00:24:17.572 --> 00:24:19.342
We don’t like this carpet.

00:24:19.342 --> 00:24:20.342
Why?

00:24:20.342 --> 00:24:27.962
Because it doesn’t appeal to our intellectual
understanding of the norms we have reached

00:24:27.962 --> 00:24:32.192
and in that frame it doesn’t fit in so we
don’t like it.

00:24:32.192 --> 00:24:39.262
Can you even create one inch of that?

00:24:39.262 --> 00:24:43.172
So this ego gives you an unauthorised action.

00:24:43.172 --> 00:24:48.212
It is unauthorised, anadhikar cheshta (नधिकार
चेष्टा).

00:24:48.212 --> 00:24:49.212
Un-authorised.

00:24:49.212 --> 00:24:53.482
You have no authority to criticise.

00:24:53.482 --> 00:25:00.912
You can’t do anything, so why should you
criticise?

00:25:00.912 --> 00:25:06.832
Better [to] appreciate and see for yourself
that you are not in authority, you are not

00:25:06.832 --> 00:25:11.131
worthy of it, to criticise.

00:25:11.131 --> 00:25:16.952
If you are not worthy of it why should you
criticise anything?

00:25:16.952 --> 00:25:26.371
And, otherwise also, you must know [that]
you are a slave of your ego.

00:25:26.371 --> 00:25:32.292
Whatever you ego dictates and your intelligence,
so-called ‘intelligence’, brings you to

00:25:32.292 --> 00:25:34.151
a point, to have some norm.

00:25:34.151 --> 00:25:40.021
And then it becomes a collective ego of a
particular community, of a particular country,

00:25:40.021 --> 00:25:42.192
of a particular ideology.

00:25:42.192 --> 00:25:43.572
It’s collective.

00:25:43.572 --> 00:25:53.021
So then they say, “Oh we think this is no
art!”

00:25:53.021 --> 00:26:00.881
That is the reason we cannot have masters
any more in art.

00:26:00.881 --> 00:26:04.641
We can’t have Rembrandt, we can’t.

00:26:04.641 --> 00:26:08.712
Poor Rembrandt must have himself suffered
a lot.

00:26:08.712 --> 00:26:11.281
You know Gauguin suffered a lot.

00:26:11.281 --> 00:26:13.402
All these artists suffered a lot.

00:26:13.402 --> 00:26:16.141
Even Michelangelo suffered a lot.

00:26:16.141 --> 00:26:22.732
Not only monetarily, not only monetarily,
but otherwise: criticise, criticise, criticise.

00:26:22.732 --> 00:26:24.261
So I think people have given up.

00:26:24.261 --> 00:26:29.072
I met an artist who had done lots of art work
and I said, “Why don’t you show me?”

00:26:29.072 --> 00:26:31.332
He said, “No I don’t want to show you.

00:26:31.332 --> 00:26:32.332
It’s created for myself."

00:26:32.332 --> 00:26:34.922
I said, “I would like to see!”

00:26:34.922 --> 00:26:39.952
I saw, it was beautiful, very beautiful, I
said, “Why don’t you show?”

00:26:39.952 --> 00:26:41.432
He said, “No use.

00:26:41.432 --> 00:26:42.432
People will just criticise.

00:26:42.432 --> 00:26:44.682
I do it for my own pleasure.

00:26:44.682 --> 00:26:53.391
They’ll just spoil the whole joy of my creation."

00:26:53.391 --> 00:26:59.112
So one of the basic things we should avoid
is to criticise others.

00:26:59.112 --> 00:27:03.962
Better to criticise yourself.

00:27:03.962 --> 00:27:10.251
Criticise yourself, criticise your brothers
and sisters, criticise your country, criticise

00:27:10.251 --> 00:27:17.692
all the habits you have and laugh at yourself,
is the best way.

00:27:17.692 --> 00:27:26.272
If you know how to laugh at yourself then
you will not object or will not stand in the

00:27:26.272 --> 00:27:29.761
way of any creativity of another person.

00:27:29.761 --> 00:27:34.472
So with ego you become so unauthorised.

00:27:34.472 --> 00:27:36.281
You can criticise anything.

00:27:36.281 --> 00:27:41.472
You think you have a right.

00:27:41.472 --> 00:27:43.862
Who has given you this right to criticise?

00:27:43.862 --> 00:27:47.432
Is the question one should ask to oneself.

00:27:47.432 --> 00:27:54.952
How can we criticise anyone?

00:27:54.952 --> 00:28:04.192
As saints, as you are now, of course, you
can make out who is caught up, who has given

00:28:04.192 --> 00:28:08.062
bad vibrations, who has the problem.

00:28:08.062 --> 00:28:09.732
You know that.

00:28:09.732 --> 00:28:11.402
You know it.

00:28:11.402 --> 00:28:13.072
It’s not conditioning.

00:28:13.072 --> 00:28:19.552
It’s not just you are doing because there’s
some ego, but you are feeling it on you fingertips.

00:28:19.552 --> 00:28:23.521
It’s an actual feeling within you.

00:28:23.521 --> 00:28:27.172
It’s the bodha (बोध: knowledge), by
which you know.

00:28:27.172 --> 00:28:31.122
Then what should you do?

00:28:31.122 --> 00:28:35.912
In your love, you have to tell the person,
if possible, that, “This is wrong with you.

00:28:35.912 --> 00:28:37.261
Better be corrected!”

00:28:37.261 --> 00:28:40.531
But in a way that he does it.

00:28:40.531 --> 00:28:44.281
On the contrary, if you tell him in a way
that he becomes even worse than what it is,

00:28:44.281 --> 00:28:47.112
you have not loved that person at all.

00:28:47.112 --> 00:28:49.792
Allow everybody to grow.

00:28:49.792 --> 00:29:04.021
There are many people in Sahaja Yoga who are
very, very good, excellent, no doubt.

00:29:04.021 --> 00:29:08.531
But also there are some people whom we can
call as very difficult; very!

00:29:08.531 --> 00:29:16.172
There’s sort of a crack in their head or
something, that part is missing sometimes.

00:29:16.172 --> 00:29:18.781
Some screws are loose I think.

00:29:18.781 --> 00:29:20.832
Sometimes they behave like clowns.

00:29:20.832 --> 00:29:22.912
And we have known some people.

00:29:22.912 --> 00:29:25.881
We just can’t help them.

00:29:25.881 --> 00:29:32.381
They could be very intelligent otherwise,
they could be very sharp otherwise, but in

00:29:32.381 --> 00:29:44.312
Sahaja Yoga they cannot come down to that
level where you can say: now the growth is

00:29:44.312 --> 00:29:46.732
possible.

00:29:46.732 --> 00:29:51.621
Supposing the Mother Earth was very hot like
the Sun, there would have been no growth.

00:29:51.621 --> 00:29:57.872
Or [if] it was cold like Moon, there would
have been no growth.

00:29:57.872 --> 00:30:06.781
It had to come to the centre where it had
both the things in proper proportions to grow.

00:30:06.781 --> 00:30:18.021
In the same way, a human being has to work
out that you keep a moderation and a balance,

00:30:18.021 --> 00:30:26.212
and understand not to go to extremes of anything.

00:30:26.212 --> 00:30:32.942
That balance you learn when you love someone.

00:30:32.942 --> 00:30:39.732
In Sahaja Yoga, as you know, we have to ask
some people to leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:39.732 --> 00:30:50.281
This is out of love for them, because once
they go out, they improve, I have seen, they

00:30:50.281 --> 00:30:54.511
tremendously improve.

00:30:54.511 --> 00:31:02.612
But when they are inside the Sahaj Yog community
they become a nuisance, and they want to be

00:31:02.612 --> 00:31:07.222
more nuisance because their ego plays the
part, maybe the conditioning plays the part,

00:31:07.222 --> 00:31:09.891
whatever it is, they want to be a nuisance.

00:31:09.891 --> 00:31:14.531
So we have to ask them that, “Please now,
depart for a while."

00:31:14.531 --> 00:31:20.511
Now if that nuisance value is lost in a person
then he has to be straightforward.

00:31:20.511 --> 00:31:33.262
He cannot be any more a nuisance and logically
it can appeal to a person, if you tell that

00:31:33.262 --> 00:31:39.281
person, that this is the reason why we want
you to be out.

00:31:39.281 --> 00:31:45.122
But they can be very disgustingly troublesome,
I know that.

00:31:45.122 --> 00:31:53.432
But you have to show complete patience and
complete understanding and you must talk like

00:31:53.432 --> 00:31:56.031
a person who loves.

00:31:56.031 --> 00:32:08.322
Love has such a power that nobody wants to
do something that will suggest that they don’t

00:32:08.322 --> 00:32:11.942
love; very powerful thing it is.

00:32:11.942 --> 00:32:18.172
It binds people in such a beautiful manner
that one wants to do something: for example

00:32:18.172 --> 00:32:20.991
you want to give me flowers, because you know
I love flowers.

00:32:20.991 --> 00:32:26.132
So you want to give me flower to suggest that,
“Mother we love you,” Just to suggest.

00:32:26.132 --> 00:32:33.741
I know you love me but you just want to, sort
of, reinforce it, the thought in me.

00:32:33.741 --> 00:32:40.412
So you want to give me a flower to show your
love and expression of your inner feeling

00:32:40.412 --> 00:32:44.151
for me.

00:32:44.151 --> 00:32:48.991
So all these material things can be used to
express your love.

00:32:48.991 --> 00:32:56.462
They can be very easily expressed in such
a manner that another person knows what is

00:32:56.462 --> 00:32:57.462
love.

00:32:57.462 --> 00:33:01.952
But the whole power of Sahastrara is love.

00:33:01.952 --> 00:33:15.822
So, if you see that, this brain has to love;
brain has to love.

00:33:15.822 --> 00:33:24.312
After now verifying the powers of Sahaja Yoga,
through your brain and intelligence, if you

00:33:24.312 --> 00:33:30.891
reach a point where you understand that: No,
it’s no use analysing, synthesising, doing

00:33:30.891 --> 00:33:32.602
all these things.

00:33:32.602 --> 00:33:33.982
It’s just love.

00:33:33.982 --> 00:33:35.822
It’s simple love.

00:33:35.822 --> 00:33:42.452
So the same Sahastrara which has been used
before, this brain, for analysing, for criticising,

00:33:42.452 --> 00:33:48.982
for doing all kinds of nonsensical things,
now wants to love and enjoy the love.

00:33:48.982 --> 00:33:55.511
And there is the culmination where the brain
just loves.

00:33:55.511 --> 00:33:58.852
That is the situation one has to reach.

00:33:58.852 --> 00:34:00.281
It just loves.

00:34:00.281 --> 00:34:03.391
It knows only love because it has seen the
power of love.

00:34:03.391 --> 00:34:08.972
You reach a certain logical conclusion, and
then you see the point.

00:34:08.972 --> 00:34:15.482
Like Adi Shankara wrote so many things like
Vivekachudamani, this, that, and all those

00:34:15.482 --> 00:34:18.352
treaties, and then he gives up, he said, “No,
nothing!”

00:34:18.352 --> 00:34:26.962
He just writes the praise of the Mother – finished!

00:34:26.962 --> 00:34:32.692
So once you reach that point, we can say now
you are in nirvikalpa because there is no

00:34:32.692 --> 00:34:36.602
vikalpa, there is no doubt in your head; because
you love.

00:34:36.602 --> 00:34:38.152
In love you don’t doubt, no question.

00:34:38.152 --> 00:34:39.872
Only when you think you doubt.

00:34:39.872 --> 00:34:46.572
But when you love you don’t doubt, you just
love, because you enjoy love.

00:34:46.572 --> 00:34:51.282
And that’s why love is joy and joy is love.

00:34:51.282 --> 00:34:57.092
So after so many days the Sahastrara has been
opened out.

00:34:57.092 --> 00:35:04.812
We have to open out our Sahastrara again:
through our meditative processes, through

00:35:04.812 --> 00:35:07.622
understanding ourselves and others.

00:35:07.622 --> 00:35:12.622
Maybe logically reaching that point: there’s
no way out now.

00:35:12.622 --> 00:35:15.372
We have reached to the end of it now.

00:35:15.372 --> 00:35:17.292
The whole logic has ended up now.

00:35:17.292 --> 00:35:21.402
Jump in the ocean of love – finished!

00:35:21.402 --> 00:35:26.852
Once you jump into the ocean of love there’s
nothing to be done; just to be enjoyed – every

00:35:26.852 --> 00:35:36.242
wave of it, every hue of it, every touch of
it.

00:35:36.242 --> 00:35:50.013
That is what one has to learn by reasoning
that Sahaja Yoga is nothing but is love.
