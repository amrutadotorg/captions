00:21.936 --> 00:31.456
Today you all have decided to have the puja
of Adi Shakti.

00:31.456 --> 00:39.636
There’s a difference between doing the puja
of Kundalini Shakti or Adi Kundalini and Adi

00:39.636 --> 00:40.636
Shakti.

00:40.636 --> 00:57.986
The difference is like this, on one side the
Kundalini is reflected in you by Adi Kundalini.

00:57.986 --> 01:05.886
The second side is the power of Adi Shakti
which is Paramchaitanya.

01:05.886 --> 01:17.746
So in totality if you see, it has two sides:
one is Her power as Paramchaitanya and also

01:17.746 --> 01:28.496
reflection in human beings as Kundalini.

01:28.496 --> 01:36.426
The third work that Adi Shakti had to do was
to create this whole universe.

01:36.426 --> 01:45.776
To begin with, as you have seen yesterday
also, how the cosmos was created and then

01:45.776 --> 01:57.996
how this special planet of Mother Earth was
created.

01:57.996 --> 02:07.546
Now what I have told you about Adam and Eve
we have found out said by also John in his

02:07.546 --> 02:09.146
Gnostics book.

02:09.146 --> 02:10.916
It is very surprising.

02:10.916 --> 02:15.736
They’ve always told you that Christ must
have told you many things but they are not

02:15.736 --> 02:17.386
in the Bible.

02:17.386 --> 02:28.296
So if you understand that this Adi Shakti
came as a serpent, the Adi Kundalini part

02:28.296 --> 02:46.406
of Her, and told the Adam and Eve, especially
Eve, that she should ask for the fruit of

02:46.406 --> 02:48.786
knowledge to be eaten.

02:48.786 --> 02:57.066
And the reason I gave you is exactly the thing
there; that the Mother power, the feminine

02:57.066 --> 03:03.376
power didn’t want Her children to live like
animals without understanding what is the

03:03.376 --> 03:11.836
knowledge of the higher realms, not giving
them chance to rise higher through their freedom

03:11.836 --> 03:19.986
and then to higher and higher awareness.

03:19.986 --> 03:23.216
It was the concern of the Mother.

03:23.216 --> 03:32.136
So there were two types of worlds were created:
one was the Divine and another one started

03:32.136 --> 03:34.216
evolving.

03:34.216 --> 03:42.126
To look at it looks very tremendous task thousands
of thousands, billions and billions of years,

03:42.126 --> 03:53.076
have passed for this kind of a work to be
done.

03:53.076 --> 04:01.376
But if you see in modern age we are going
to the moon, at such a small, with such a

04:01.376 --> 04:11.585
small effort and also with, with such a little
time you reach there.

04:11.585 --> 04:15.826
Nobody could think that we ever be there.

04:15.826 --> 04:20.236
All this is happened through the human brain.

04:20.236 --> 04:23.455
Now what is the human brain after all?

04:23.455 --> 04:33.226
Human brain is not at all anywhere near the
brain of the [Bharat?] nor is this used fully,

04:33.226 --> 04:35.235
it’s not used fully.

04:35.235 --> 04:41.765
It’s very little bit is used by human beings,
by which they have achieved this kind of a

04:41.765 --> 04:43.175
flight to moon.

04:43.175 --> 04:47.605
Of course there was no purpose in it, I don’t
know why they are doing it.

04:47.605 --> 04:58.395
But they did it.

04:58.395 --> 05:01.776
So the whole nature was created by Her.

05:01.776 --> 05:09.795
Whatever you see today around yourself is
all created by Her, is all Her work that is

05:09.795 --> 05:10.795
there.

05:10.795 --> 05:18.106
You’ll be amazed, just now I said I was
going to wear a very heavy sari and I said

05:18.106 --> 05:23.996
it’s very hot so better change to a simple
sari so I changed and when I came out I found

05:23.996 --> 05:28.906
it has become cooler.

05:28.906 --> 05:38.866
So the nature knows everything and who informs
the nature is this Paramchaitanya.

05:38.866 --> 05:45.686
Paramchaitanya was never that active which
has started since My birth, I should say,

05:45.686 --> 05:47.915
when Krita Yuga started.

05:47.915 --> 05:53.705
At this time you had to have your realisation.

05:53.705 --> 05:59.575
That was decided by the Divine collectivity
you can call it.

05:59.575 --> 06:06.026
All the Gods, Goddesses, all of them decided
to put this work on somebody who thought,

06:06.026 --> 06:11.776
whom they thought to be very capable.

06:11.776 --> 06:18.515
So They said We all will be with You, entirely
with You, all Our powers will be with You

06:18.515 --> 06:26.695
but You take up this job now in this Kali
Yuga to transform human beings.

06:26.695 --> 06:34.635
In a way human beings are more difficult than
animals because they have their own freedom

06:34.635 --> 06:40.915
and they have been given this freedom to achieve
their final freedom.

06:40.915 --> 06:48.776
In their freedom, the way they behave, is
something very surprising how they go completely

06:48.776 --> 06:58.225
out of control and try to do things which
are so destructive.

06:58.225 --> 07:03.505
Of course in Kali Yuga it was predicted in
India but I think they could not predict what

07:03.505 --> 07:08.975
would happen in America or what would happen
in the Western countries where people have

07:08.975 --> 07:18.915
freedom just to destroy themselves and they’re
finding new methods of destroying themselves.

07:18.915 --> 07:30.186
This tendency cannot be curbed, cannot be
stopped by Adi Shakti or by God Almighty because

07:30.186 --> 07:36.846
you have been given the freedom to ruin yourselves,
spoil yourselves and to go to hell.

07:36.846 --> 07:41.096
That cannot be controlled by any Divine power.

07:41.096 --> 07:45.376
Divine power also respects your freedom.

07:45.376 --> 07:55.086
So the Divine collectivity thought, are We
going to completely ruin the creation of Adi

07:55.086 --> 07:56.306
Shakti.

07:56.306 --> 08:06.795
Are We going to completely destroy whatever
She has created and then re-create something

08:06.795 --> 08:11.145
better, this was the discussion going on.

08:11.145 --> 08:19.145
And most of Them were so fed up with the human
beings, especially with the Western freedom

08:19.145 --> 08:23.246
that They said these people want help.

08:23.246 --> 08:31.225
And why should We give them the Heavens, it’s
not proper.

08:31.225 --> 08:37.336
So first thing Adi Shakti did was to create
a seeking in them.

08:37.336 --> 08:43.336
She created it, this desire to seek.

08:43.336 --> 08:50.226
And so these people belonging to this culture
which was so destructive started seeking.

08:50.226 --> 08:56.266
And when the seeking started, also, as usual
in the market there were many others who came

08:56.266 --> 08:59.736
forward to demand [answers/substance?] to
their seeking.

08:59.736 --> 09:06.236
They had to go to various cults and things
and false people and all that because they

09:06.236 --> 09:09.046
had no way to know.

09:09.046 --> 09:22.056
But if they had read some books of enlightened
people like Kabir, like Nanak, even Gnostics,

09:22.056 --> 09:29.076
their scriptures, anything like that, they
would have understood what is the truth and

09:29.076 --> 09:33.335
where to find it and how to find it.

09:33.335 --> 09:45.956
It is a big struggle I find between the people
who are seekers and those who are not at all

09:45.956 --> 09:46.956
seekers.

09:46.956 --> 09:51.405
They don’t want to know and they can never
be seekers.

09:51.405 --> 09:56.705
I can assure you that some of them will never
think of seeking.

09:56.705 --> 10:01.407
They’ll get possessed, they’ll have diseases,
they’ll have earthquakes, they’ll have

10:01.407 --> 10:07.796
anything, they will never seek.

10:07.796 --> 10:13.936
Even if they get diseases, they’ll say “Oh,
we are martyrs, we’re doing great work”.

10:13.936 --> 10:20.895
Such stupidity has come into their heads that
they think that by doing these wrong things,

10:20.895 --> 10:24.946
we are going to be saved.

10:24.946 --> 10:31.476
And this stupidity comes through perverted
brains.

10:31.476 --> 10:37.126
And this perverted brain acts when people
are free to use.

10:37.126 --> 10:43.515
I just don’t know why don’t they see around
and see for themselves what is happening.

10:43.515 --> 10:49.756
So to expect that the whole world will go
to Heaven is absolutely not possible, it’s

10:49.756 --> 10:52.926
not possible, it cannot.

10:52.926 --> 10:54.626
They have tried all kinds of things.

10:54.626 --> 10:59.645
I’ve seen people ah drugs, alcohol, this,
that.

10:59.645 --> 11:08.186
There is one fellow who got his PhD on writing
how he reached spirituality through drinking

11:08.186 --> 11:11.486
and they gave him PhD for that.

11:11.486 --> 11:18.636
So even at the helm of affairs in the universities,
I don’t know how such stupid people came

11:18.636 --> 11:21.646
up, from where, out of which creation.

11:21.646 --> 11:29.666
It’s impossible to understand how could
they think that this kind of destruction will

11:29.666 --> 11:32.095
lead them to their salvation.

11:32.095 --> 11:34.146
They see it everyday.

11:34.146 --> 11:36.196
They watch it everyday.

11:36.196 --> 11:40.926
They know it, it’s happening but still they
cannot listen.

11:40.926 --> 11:49.606
But those who are seekers are so ardently
seeking that they will all have to be given

11:49.606 --> 11:51.486
their self-realisation.

11:51.486 --> 11:55.076
Now this is of course My job I agree.

11:55.076 --> 11:57.395
I have come on this earth for that job.

11:57.395 --> 12:00.016
I am suppose to do it.

12:00.016 --> 12:08.136
I am trying my level best and no incarnation
has lived like I have lived for so many years

12:08.136 --> 12:16.955
and such compassion of Mine which really makes
Me think that I feel we have to have many

12:16.955 --> 12:25.116
more sahaja yogis, we have to have big salvation.

12:25.116 --> 12:34.986
With that compassion and with that love, one
can take to any measures, anything.

12:34.986 --> 12:40.306
I do not think those who are not seekers will
achieve it.

12:40.306 --> 12:43.856
Now why is it some are seekers and some are
not?

12:43.856 --> 12:50.416
One may say that Adi Shakti if She has created
all the human beings, all of them should have

12:50.416 --> 12:53.765
seeking.

12:53.765 --> 12:57.825
Because in freedom, they have lost their way.

12:57.825 --> 13:00.756
They are seeking something else.

13:00.756 --> 13:02.345
And they think they’re right.

13:02.345 --> 13:04.896
They have a right to think that they are right.

13:04.896 --> 13:07.997
Even a stupid fellow, even a mad person thinks
he's right.

13:07.997 --> 13:14.706
If you tell him that you are mad, he’ll
say, you are mad.

13:14.706 --> 13:24.136
And this seeking though put into them, they
are not yet capable, so many of them, of achieving

13:24.136 --> 13:28.465
it in the proper way.

13:28.465 --> 13:36.136
Because for that one has to surrender, not
one’s freedom, not one’s intelligence

13:36.136 --> 13:40.466
but the ego that has developed in human beings.

13:40.466 --> 13:45.215
With this ego even I’ve seen people who
are possessed, they want to keep their ego

13:45.215 --> 13:52.535
intact and through the ego they want to use,
to use the possessions.

13:52.535 --> 13:53.535
Can you imagine?

13:53.535 --> 13:57.306
There are possessions of negative forces.

13:57.306 --> 14:07.825
Such people want to keep that intact so that
they can use it for their own purpose.

14:07.825 --> 14:12.486
They don’t hate it, they don’t want to
get rid of it.

14:12.486 --> 14:18.426
But they want to keep it just because they
can use this possessions for their use.

14:18.426 --> 14:23.176
So the category of seeking is much less there.

14:23.176 --> 14:32.256
But there are many who are no where near seeking
who are really what we call them the evil

14:32.256 --> 14:38.716
people and they never want, never never would
want that this world should change.

14:38.716 --> 14:42.015
Our media is dominated by these evil people.

14:42.015 --> 14:44.426
They don’t want world to change.

14:44.426 --> 14:47.116
They don’t want to show anything that is
good.

14:47.116 --> 14:53.986
They don’t want to see the point what is
going to help, what is benevolent for human

14:53.986 --> 14:54.986
beings.

14:54.986 --> 15:07.616
So on one side, we see
such collective search, collective negativity.

15:07.616 --> 15:12.026
Another side we find seekers who are real
seekers.

15:12.026 --> 15:18.306
There are some we can call as half-baked and
some are pseudo seekers.

15:18.306 --> 15:32.775
If there, and in the name of seeking, if they
have done we can say some sort of a sacrifice

15:32.775 --> 15:37.535
for them, they are very great.

15:37.535 --> 15:44.856
Also they get involved with people who are
claiming.

15:44.856 --> 15:49.046
Because I have never claimed anything, they
are not impressed by me.

15:49.046 --> 15:50.666
I’ve not changed my dress.

15:50.666 --> 15:53.215
I live like a housewife.

15:53.215 --> 15:55.326
So they are not impressed by me.

15:55.326 --> 16:00.445
I have not developed two [horns??] to show
something great about myself so they won’t

16:00.445 --> 16:01.936
be impressed.

16:01.936 --> 16:08.976
But on the other side if you see, this is
maya, this is Mahamaya where Adi Shakti you

16:08.976 --> 16:14.486
see does everything like human beings do,
everything.

16:14.486 --> 16:18.686
You won’t be able to find out that She is
Divine.

16:18.686 --> 16:23.866
My family people could not find out till I
started this work, none of them, except for

16:23.866 --> 16:28.126
my father and mother.

16:28.126 --> 16:34.606
Nobody could find out that I had any powers.

16:34.606 --> 16:44.056
Such insensitivity to Divine can be created
by Mahamaya power of Adi Shakti, which is

16:44.056 --> 16:49.666
very important, otherwise you cannot judge,
you cannot understand.

16:49.666 --> 16:57.476
Despite that, I’ve many times misjudged
people because they know how to camouflage

16:57.476 --> 16:59.746
for a little while.

16:59.746 --> 17:02.016
But then I discover.

17:02.016 --> 17:12.566
If the seeking is ardent and they are seeking
really the truth, they will find it, they

17:12.566 --> 17:17.465
will find it, no doubt because the whole creation
is for them.

17:17.465 --> 17:22.095
The whole universe is for them.

17:22.095 --> 17:24.166
All Dieties are for them.

17:24.166 --> 17:26.796
All angels are for them.

17:26.796 --> 17:31.236
They are all looking out for them.

17:31.236 --> 17:37.276
This is important that we have so many sahaja
yogis.

17:37.276 --> 17:43.676
Nobody had so many sahaja yogis in their lifetime.

17:43.676 --> 17:47.476
Because we have to have channels.

17:47.476 --> 17:54.406
I have to have channels and these channels
have to be very clean, have to be beautiful,

17:54.406 --> 18:00.386
innocent and benevolent.

18:00.386 --> 18:12.736
If only they surrender to this fact that we
are here for as the instrument of God Almighty

18:12.736 --> 18:27.726
and that we have to give benevolence to others,
I tell you at least 70% of work is done.

18:27.726 --> 18:39.496
But even if they have got realisation, like
an egg comes out of the shell, some of the

18:39.496 --> 18:50.666
birds still carry the part of the egg and
some of them are not even grown up to be birds.

18:50.666 --> 18:53.706
Now we have to judge ourselves.

18:53.706 --> 18:59.326
We have to understand ourselves.

18:59.326 --> 19:06.136
Another thing you know that, I’m a very
mild person, very mild.

19:06.136 --> 19:08.606
People think I’m very forgiving.

19:08.606 --> 19:11.646
I know everyone, not that I don’t.

19:11.646 --> 19:18.046
But I allow alright, go ahead, as far as you
can go.

19:18.046 --> 19:22.896
Experience is the only way a human being can
understand, no doubt.

19:22.896 --> 19:26.266
If you tell him something, he will never understand.

19:26.266 --> 19:33.556
Experience of self-realisation has made you
understand but again, I would say, that we

19:33.556 --> 19:40.146
cannot give realisation to the whole world,
we cannot.

19:40.146 --> 19:44.676
They’re like stones, absolutely horrible
people.

19:44.676 --> 19:51.996
Whatever is happening is that those who are
false are getting exposed.

19:51.996 --> 19:56.726
And everybody is noticing that that they are
getting exposed.

19:56.726 --> 20:01.456
This exposure of course will save them from
these horrible people.

20:01.456 --> 20:09.066
But I don’t know if they will come to Sahaja
Yoga or if they would take their realisation.

20:09.066 --> 20:17.006
This I’m telling you because now I to have
experience of human beings and all these years

20:17.006 --> 20:25.626
I have been working, I have seen that there
are people and people and people.

20:25.626 --> 20:35.176
Out of them the seekers are extremely proud
of their seeking.

20:35.176 --> 20:40.076
So some of them don’t want to give up their
seeking, it's, it’s kind of a job.

20:40.076 --> 20:45.076
You can call it a hobby, they are seekers.

20:45.076 --> 20:53.956
Now they have a certificate of being a seeker,
they wear funny dresses, have funny houses,

20:53.956 --> 20:59.446
funny hair, everything, recluses they could
be, aggressive, anything, we are seekers.

20:59.446 --> 21:04.086
They take a certificate upon themselves, we
are seekers.

21:04.086 --> 21:07.326
This is another quality of seekers also.

21:07.326 --> 21:14.946
They, for them it’s a kind of lifestyle,
they're seekers and wherever they have to

21:14.946 --> 21:18.386
go, they will go for seeking, they’ll go
to 10 places, or 20 places.

21:18.386 --> 21:24.426
Every time they have argued with me, Mother
there must be some more ways of, yes maybe,

21:24.426 --> 21:33.006
I don’t know of any, you can know.

21:33.006 --> 21:38.996
Now the main job of Adi Shakti today is to
give realisation.

21:38.996 --> 21:40.946
That’s My main job.

21:40.946 --> 21:48.566
All the rest is looked after, is already managed
I should say is like a computer.

21:48.566 --> 21:53.026
I don’t have to work it, it’s a reflex
action.

21:53.026 --> 21:55.496
Whatever is happening is in a reflex action.

21:55.496 --> 22:03.106
I don’t have to worry about these things,
whether ah like people might say that, “Mother

22:03.106 --> 22:08.766
I prayed to you and how is it you helped me
so much?”

22:08.766 --> 22:11.186
It’s all reflex action.

22:11.186 --> 22:16.406
That time maybe that thought may come to me,
thought, but it’s reflex action.

22:16.406 --> 22:18.886
I really don’t do anything.

22:18.886 --> 22:20.876
Actually, I’m a [Shria??].

22:20.876 --> 22:22.246
Not doing anything whatsoever.

22:22.246 --> 22:28.716
The laziest person you could think of is Me.

22:28.716 --> 22:40.116
Really because if there's a complete organisation
working for Me why should I, why [there is

22:40.116 --> 22:41.916
nothing necessary].

22:41.916 --> 22:54.706
But one thing is there, I’m witnessing and
when I’m witnessing that acts on the reflex,

22:54.706 --> 22:58.236
that works out, the Paramchaitanya.

22:58.236 --> 23:10.896
Because if that is the power of the Adi Shakti
then whatever I witness gets reported to that

23:10.896 --> 23:11.906
power.

23:11.906 --> 23:20.626
It’s the other way round, like see we have
electricity power somewhere so something goes

23:20.626 --> 23:24.716
wrong here, it is not reflected to that power.

23:24.716 --> 23:26.356
It is not.

23:26.356 --> 23:29.356
Something goes wrong, it finishes off here
and here.

23:29.356 --> 23:37.206
But the other way round that if I witness
something wrong, I don’t have to do anything,

23:37.206 --> 23:45.506
I just witness, I’m just watching, the whole
thing acts through this tremendous power of

23:45.506 --> 23:47.366
Paramchaitanya.

23:47.366 --> 23:52.296
Now this power you do not know.

23:52.296 --> 24:00.236
You know Kundalini, you know all about charkas
there, this, that, but this power of Paramchaitanya

24:00.236 --> 24:13.026
is in every particle in you, every atom.

24:13.026 --> 24:31.116
And it acts in such a manner that it directs,
it pushes you, it takes you to the path of

24:31.116 --> 24:32.116
benevolence.

24:32.116 --> 24:38.036
Sometimes people say, “Mother I wanted to
see to buy this shop, I couldn’t get it"

24:38.036 --> 24:39.036
and all that.

24:39.036 --> 24:42.776
It is for your benevolence you didn’t get,
thank God.

24:42.776 --> 24:49.606
After 10 days they’ll come and say, thank
God I didn’t get it.

24:49.606 --> 24:57.306
So gradually through experience, you start
understanding that you don’t have to worry.

24:57.306 --> 25:03.426
If you are lost on the way, normally people
get very upset but sahaja yogis don’t, oh

25:03.426 --> 25:09.736
very nice, must be something here that God
has brought us.

25:09.736 --> 25:15.106
This action is like then changes.

25:15.106 --> 25:27.266
I would say the person who is overactive,
starts thinking now, surrender, Islam, surrender.

25:27.266 --> 25:38.626
Give this problem to this Paramchaitanya and
it works.

25:38.626 --> 25:52.156
Such tremendous things have happened in this
world just by bandhans that it is unbelievable

25:52.156 --> 25:57.346
how these things are happening.

25:57.346 --> 26:05.216
Even supposing you find there are so many
murders, this thing has happened, that has

26:05.216 --> 26:06.216
happened.

26:06.216 --> 26:14.676
This is also just to express presence of Paramchaitanya,
it’s prutha, it’s working out.

26:14.676 --> 26:18.396
The way it works.

26:18.396 --> 26:22.156
Prutha means the one which is done.

26:22.156 --> 26:32.676
Then you start realising that this power you
can achieve through your Kundalini.

26:32.676 --> 26:40.806
So when your Kundalini rises, that is also
a reflection of Adi Shakti.

26:40.806 --> 26:47.056
Like we can say, we see one part of moon,
the another part we don’t see.

26:47.056 --> 26:57.996
In the same way this power when rises within
you and touches this Paramchaitanya, then

26:57.996 --> 27:00.846
you become empowered by that.

27:00.846 --> 27:06.676
That’s how you are sahaja yogis.

27:06.676 --> 27:10.086
But you are not God.

27:10.086 --> 27:17.636
The incarnations can say, “Í am God”.

27:17.636 --> 27:20.836
You are not incarnations.

27:20.836 --> 27:33.446
But none of the incarnations have ever said
that they are Adi Shakti, cannot.

27:33.446 --> 27:41.536
This power of Adi Shakti which we call Paramchaitanya
is the power that loves you, has complete

27:41.536 --> 27:43.766
control of the nature.

27:43.766 --> 27:57.936
It understands, it thinks, it knows everything,
everything about you, it knows.

27:57.936 --> 28:07.466
It works in every angle in every walk of your
life.

28:07.466 --> 28:18.966
It is with you entirely as if supposing you
fall into a river which is flowing fast and

28:18.966 --> 28:28.756
you cannot swim anymore, you cannot use your
hands anymore, you start flowing with it and

28:28.756 --> 28:35.596
then you realise that flowing with it is a
better thing than to try to get out of it.

28:35.596 --> 28:42.056
But just flowing with it, just enjoy all the
nature around you.

28:42.056 --> 28:43.056
You don’t get drowned.

28:43.056 --> 28:47.326
On the contrary, you feel you are elevated.

28:47.326 --> 28:54.176
And you’re flowing with it, then you understand,
what am I to do about something, whether it’s

28:54.176 --> 28:59.826
done by Paramchaitanya for me.

28:59.826 --> 29:07.216
But that it should be given to your Kundalini
which has worked it out, has put you onto

29:07.216 --> 29:16.326
that shore, has put you onto that beautiful
Heavenly Kingdom of God.

29:16.326 --> 29:22.116
Thus, you understand there are two things
that have happened: that first, your Mother,

29:22.116 --> 29:27.506
your Kundalini which is within you, which
is your own Mother, which has been with you

29:27.506 --> 29:30.966
throughout, has given you this birth.

29:30.966 --> 29:38.236
And then it has taken to that power, which
power you can use yourself.

29:38.236 --> 29:41.696
You are empowered by that.

29:41.696 --> 29:44.606
You’ll be amazed how this power helps.

29:44.606 --> 29:54.566
I mean, you see, I shouldn’t say that you
can have all the powers, I shouldn’t say

29:54.566 --> 29:55.566
that.

29:55.566 --> 29:59.166
But today you see they were complaining about
somebody, immediately I told the name of the

29:59.166 --> 30:00.166
person.

30:00.166 --> 30:03.156
Now you’ll say, how I knew.

30:03.156 --> 30:04.866
I just know.

30:04.866 --> 30:06.009
That’s all I can say.

30:06.009 --> 30:08.416
I just know.

30:08.416 --> 30:13.116
Supposing you are dealing with carpets, alright,
so you know what pattern is this, what pattern

30:13.116 --> 30:20.646
is that, from where it has come, everything,
you know, isn’t it.

30:20.646 --> 30:24.156
If you are there, you know everything.

30:24.156 --> 30:32.016
If this power is everywhere, one has to know
everything, the connection is such.

30:32.016 --> 30:37.446
If you want to know, you can know anything.

30:37.446 --> 30:49.256
So they have called also Buddha as Avalokiteshvara
that He sees all the lotus How does He see,

30:49.256 --> 31:06.126
Avalokiteshvara, because His ego what we call
is the paramaego, Mahatahamkara, knows everything,

31:06.126 --> 31:13.256
while your ego doesn’t know anything.

31:13.256 --> 31:22.816
Because it doesn’t know anything, you are
enveloped by it.

31:22.816 --> 31:30.506
If he had known, if the ego had known what
is the truth, you’ll be free person absolutely

31:30.506 --> 31:31.506
free.

31:31.506 --> 31:33.796
But you don’t want to surrender your ego.

31:33.796 --> 31:41.776
You don’t want to allow yourself to flow
into the river as Tao, [??] we say.

31:41.776 --> 31:48.656
No you don’t want to enjoy, you want to
have your own speciality.

31:48.656 --> 31:58.246
Individuality is very different from having
a kind of a ego within yourself that I am

31:58.246 --> 32:00.196
this, I am that.

32:00.196 --> 32:09.506
So this differentiation must start, after
realisation, in the light of realisation,

32:09.506 --> 32:12.106
you should start seeing.

32:12.106 --> 32:19.946
Now the first and foremost thing is to tell
your ego to sit down, keep quiet, you don’t

32:19.946 --> 32:22.126
want.

32:22.126 --> 32:27.456
And also in the modern times it’s a big
fashion you ask somebody, “I don’t know”.

32:27.456 --> 32:31.906
You ask somebody, what’s your name, “I
don’t know”.

32:31.906 --> 32:36.396
He doesn’t even know his name.

32:36.396 --> 32:42.166
And to be stupid is a fashion.

32:42.166 --> 32:46.756
To show that you are very stupid they think
they are showing they’re very innocent.

32:46.756 --> 32:48.786
It’s not, it’s a stupidity.

32:48.786 --> 32:52.026
This stupidity, I don’t know which animal
has.

32:52.026 --> 32:55.156
Still I don’t know what is the source of
it.

32:55.156 --> 32:59.116
Still I’ll have to find out.

32:59.116 --> 33:02.096
Who is the animal that has generated this
stupidity in them.

33:02.096 --> 33:08.276
But I know one thing, it is our ego.

33:08.276 --> 33:12.886
Ego makes a person absolutely stupid.

33:12.886 --> 33:21.956
In Marathi, you see, thank God, language is
so rich, that anybody who starts showing off

33:21.956 --> 33:29.716
his ego, they say his climbing on a bush,
there is a little bush and he is climbing

33:29.716 --> 33:31.276
on that.

33:31.276 --> 33:44.296
All this ego comes through your own so called
ideas, achievements.

33:44.296 --> 33:48.316
But what are these achievements.

33:48.316 --> 33:53.286
You don’t know anything.

33:53.286 --> 33:58.936
And this is what today I have to tell you
that if anything is working out today, is

33:58.936 --> 34:03.186
your surrender of your ego.

34:03.186 --> 34:08.036
If you know how to surrender your ego, you’ll
work it out.

34:08.036 --> 34:13.266
Another thing which surprises me sometimes,
in the West specially, that I think that the

34:13.266 --> 34:16.736
women are the power are the Shakti.

34:16.736 --> 34:27.685
But in the West I find women are not using
Adi Shakti, no.

34:27.685 --> 34:43.025
Firstly, they are still very much possessed
by their emotions and by their ideas and things

34:43.025 --> 34:44.276
like that.

34:44.276 --> 34:47.185
One side is man, who is doing everything.

34:47.185 --> 34:50.966
But even women are very egoistical, very much.

34:50.966 --> 34:52.855
It’s very difficult.

34:52.855 --> 35:02.466
For example, you marry some girl, Western
girl, to somebody, she’ll be very happy,

35:02.466 --> 35:10.266
jumping, taking all the presents, congratulations,
wearing all dress, everything.

35:10.266 --> 35:14.875
After 10 days, she’ll come and say, “Mother
I’m confused”.

35:14.875 --> 35:16.586
Confused, how?

35:16.586 --> 35:19.136
“I’m now confused”.

35:19.136 --> 35:21.926
You’re confused now or before.

35:21.926 --> 35:23.275
“I’m now confused”.

35:23.275 --> 35:24.275
Alright.

35:24.275 --> 35:25.275
You return all your ornaments and everything.

35:25.275 --> 35:29.365
“No, no then let me think”.

35:29.365 --> 35:35.706
This is not the level of a sahaja yogini.

35:35.706 --> 35:44.166
Sahaja yogini is the Shakti and she has to
take up challenges, I’ll show you, I’ll

35:44.166 --> 35:45.796
do it better.

35:45.796 --> 35:53.966
On the contrary I find them extremely dominating,
I’m amazed, why should Shakti dominate.

35:53.966 --> 35:57.416
If she’s Shakti, she’ll not dominate.

35:57.416 --> 35:59.816
Those who are not will dominate.

35:59.816 --> 36:07.986
Like you see you go in India to any collector’s
house, the collector will be humble but the

36:07.986 --> 36:11.526
constable would be dominating.

36:11.526 --> 36:19.176
In the same way, I find, this domination business
is very common.

36:19.176 --> 36:26.825
And also a kind of a temperament of like a
nun.

36:26.825 --> 36:30.865
They’ll dress up like a nun, behave like
a nun.

36:30.865 --> 36:33.216
They won’t smile.

36:33.216 --> 36:34.216
What is?

36:34.216 --> 36:35.246
Are you sahaja yoginis?

36:35.246 --> 36:38.015
Or what are you, are you nuns?

36:38.015 --> 36:39.426
Then better join nunnery.

36:39.426 --> 36:45.585
Why I’m telling you while talking about
Adi Shakti so I’m talking about Shakti,

36:45.585 --> 36:48.436
how the Shakti has to come up.

36:48.436 --> 36:53.515
I was surprised that women were not spreading
Sahaja Yoga.

36:53.515 --> 36:56.926
Somebody told me that the leaders do not want
women to spread Sahaja Yoga.

36:56.926 --> 36:57.926
This is wrong.

36:57.926 --> 37:01.125
If the leaders say that, it’s not proper.

37:01.125 --> 37:12.095
But first of all the sahaja yoginis have to
be real sahaja yoginis because so far I’ve

37:12.095 --> 37:18.865
seen anybody is, you try to give any lady,
try to give her the position of a leader,

37:18.865 --> 37:22.656
she just finishes off the thing.

37:22.656 --> 37:27.605
Not all, but some.

37:27.605 --> 37:43.146
Now the duty of a sahaja yogini is to develop
herself through meditation, through understanding

37:43.146 --> 37:52.476
oneself and through self-esteem that I’m
a sahaja yogini, I’m the one who is Shakti,

37:52.476 --> 37:55.085
I’m the potential of that.

37:55.085 --> 37:57.035
I’m the potential myself.

37:57.035 --> 37:58.396
What do I do, nothing?

37:58.396 --> 38:03.085
I didn’t do like this, I didn’t put this
on, nothing of the kind.

38:03.085 --> 38:06.886
I’m nice visiting and talking.

38:06.886 --> 38:12.196
But potential, am I the potential?

38:12.196 --> 38:17.055
This is what the sahaja yoginis have to decide.

38:17.055 --> 38:25.345
Otherwise, they’re possessed, they're day
dreaming, thinking no end of themselves.

38:25.345 --> 38:27.656
It’s very difficult.

38:27.656 --> 38:34.206
I want some nice sahaja yoginis to be the
leaders, I really want.

38:34.206 --> 38:41.636
But as soon as they become leader, they are
on a horse, running so fast.

38:41.636 --> 38:46.226
So humble downwards.

38:46.226 --> 38:54.535
Unless and until there’s a big space in
the pitcher what water can flow into it.

38:54.535 --> 38:57.236
Have a very large heart.

38:57.236 --> 39:04.046
Anybody comes to your house, you don’t like
it, don’t want to do anything for other

39:04.046 --> 39:08.426
sahaja yogis, looking after them.

39:08.426 --> 39:14.855
It is really again and again I say in the
West, that women have to take up Shakti unto

39:14.855 --> 39:15.855
themselves.

39:15.855 --> 39:19.276
And Shakti doesn’t mean dominate your husband
and make a fool out of him.

39:19.276 --> 39:23.886
No, it means give him powers.

39:23.886 --> 39:28.396
You are the supply of power of the whole family.

39:28.396 --> 39:30.176
And this is our family.

39:30.176 --> 39:31.636
All this is my family.

39:31.636 --> 39:33.466
I’m so concerned about everyone.

39:33.466 --> 39:37.176
Even the little thing I’m bothered about.

39:37.176 --> 39:43.725
I’m never satisfied that I’ve done my
job now and I can now tonight I’ll go off

39:43.725 --> 39:45.966
to sleep and not think of anyone.

39:45.966 --> 39:47.236
Never.

39:47.236 --> 39:50.746
I’m concerned about this, I’m concerned
about that.

39:50.746 --> 40:00.576
All the time it’s flowing, this power, and
My concern this power that works because My

40:00.576 --> 40:02.636
concern is genuine.

40:02.636 --> 40:06.085
I’m not concerned about Myself, never.

40:06.085 --> 40:14.406
You’ll be amazed when I see all these women
doing all kinds of things to themselves, I’m

40:14.406 --> 40:15.406
surprised.

40:15.406 --> 40:18.666
What is needed is the concern.

40:18.666 --> 40:27.456
And once you develop that concern, a genuine,
loving, compassionate concern about others.

40:27.456 --> 40:32.186
Even about children, I’ve seen that, they
never look after each other’s children.

40:32.186 --> 40:34.656
They never help others.

40:34.656 --> 40:40.025
Somebody had to go for taking out the tooth,
she had to carry the child with her.

40:40.025 --> 40:42.265
This is true.

40:42.265 --> 40:48.365
If you do not have concern, then you’ll
not have collective mind, you’ll not have

40:48.365 --> 40:50.976
the collective power.

40:50.976 --> 40:56.746
And it’s important that you all should try
to be very collective, look after each other’s.

40:56.746 --> 41:02.005
Now I shouldn’t say this, I was going to
tell it to Cabella ladies, that this house

41:02.005 --> 41:08.216
in Cabella is an ashram and those people who
come from other ashrams, even from Australia,

41:08.216 --> 41:11.996
are surprised, that they are all living here
just like a hotel.

41:11.996 --> 41:17.976
They’re paying for it, we all pay but we
have gardens, we look after the gardens, we

41:17.976 --> 41:19.716
look after the outside.

41:19.716 --> 41:21.936
Here nobody’s bothered.

41:21.936 --> 41:26.676
They’re using everything, not bothered.

41:26.676 --> 41:31.375
Surprisingly why when I’m living here, they
are like this.

41:31.375 --> 41:36.555
You go to any place in Australia, you go to
America, anywhere, wherever there’s an ashram,

41:36.555 --> 41:40.186
they all work on Sundays.

41:40.186 --> 41:41.186
Here I’ve not seen.

41:41.186 --> 41:42.186
They all disappear.

41:42.186 --> 41:44.646
This is your ashram.

41:44.646 --> 41:46.956
You are staying here.

41:46.956 --> 41:53.765
And is now today I have to tell this because
I feel that Sahaja Yoga is missing out itself

41:53.765 --> 41:57.176
on their Shaktis.

41:57.176 --> 42:03.365
Some of them do not know how to smiling, And
some of them are extremely dominating.

42:03.365 --> 42:07.115
I have to tell you this because you are so
important.

42:07.115 --> 42:10.156
But for Me, no man would have done this job.

42:10.156 --> 42:12.986
No man incarnation would have done this job.

42:12.986 --> 42:16.946
Christ, he get crucified at a young age, very
nice.

42:16.946 --> 42:25.156
Get crucified at such a young age, then another
one takes to poison, another one is killed

42:25.156 --> 42:26.156
by somebody.

42:26.156 --> 42:29.535
It’s like that, they all died very young.

42:29.535 --> 42:35.555
Nobody wanted to do this work, nobody was,
I mean, they got fed up.

42:35.555 --> 42:36.926
Got fed up.

42:36.926 --> 42:42.437
We had Ganeshwara who went into Samadhi at
the age of 23 years, can you imagine.

42:42.437 --> 42:46.026
He must have been fed up with the people.

42:46.026 --> 42:53.676
Now it is for you people, the ladies, have
to develop that patience of your Mother, that

42:53.676 --> 43:00.036
affection, that love and then you will see
how your Shakti will work out.

43:00.036 --> 43:04.186
I again and again always have talked about
this.

43:04.186 --> 43:12.216
And at Adi Shakti point, I have to say you
are in your family like a Shakti.

43:12.216 --> 43:15.446
And you have to be wise, you have to be sensible.

43:15.446 --> 43:17.315
You have to understand your husband.

43:17.315 --> 43:19.006
You have to understand your children.

43:19.006 --> 43:20.625
You have to have patience.

43:20.625 --> 43:24.766
On the contrary, they spoil their children.

43:24.766 --> 43:31.526
That is to be understood, that you must know
first what is good for their benevolence.

43:31.526 --> 43:38.986
Today for example, if I say the children if
they go to a school, they should not be removed.

43:38.986 --> 43:40.236
It is for their benevolence.

43:40.236 --> 43:44.095
What are the people going to gain out of it.

43:44.095 --> 43:45.926
So somebody says no.

43:45.926 --> 43:48.946
Alright, get out.

43:48.946 --> 43:53.146
What can you do?

43:53.146 --> 43:58.706
Such attachment to your own children shows
you are a powerless person.

43:58.706 --> 44:05.696
You must love all the children, you must look
after all the children, you must enjoy all

44:05.696 --> 44:09.476
the children, take interest.

44:09.476 --> 44:16.005
But what I find that they are only interested
in their own children.

44:16.005 --> 44:17.845
We are a joint family.

44:17.845 --> 44:20.276
We live together.

44:20.276 --> 44:24.996
We have to share everything.

44:24.996 --> 44:28.926
It is something I can’t understand.

44:28.926 --> 44:38.196
Say, our, in India, say, if you see 5, 6 children,
all the girls will run after them.

44:38.196 --> 44:39.686
All the women will look after them.

44:39.686 --> 44:46.035
I mean, it’s such a pleasure to them, to
any children, just to look after them.

44:46.035 --> 44:56.526
But this kind of insensitivity to your collective
behaviour is going to also spoil your children.

44:56.526 --> 45:08.136
So what you are going to transmit to the whole
world is this Sahaja living and the women

45:08.136 --> 45:09.566
make the society.

45:09.566 --> 45:15.375
If Indian society is good, the credit goes
to the Indian women and their wisdom.

45:15.375 --> 45:16.805
Men are stupid in India.

45:16.805 --> 45:20.446
They spoil politics, economics, everything.

45:20.446 --> 45:30.325
But society is still maintained and they are
very very still say on the right path.

45:30.325 --> 45:34.375
This only comes because of the wisdom of the
women.

45:34.375 --> 45:39.976
If the women are busy dressing up for hours
together, thinking about their clothes, what

45:39.976 --> 45:46.575
they’re going to wear, finished.

45:46.575 --> 45:57.486
This is a day of worshipping the Kundalini
who is the Mother.

45:57.486 --> 45:59.736
She is the Mother.

45:59.736 --> 46:01.386
And you are the mother.

46:01.386 --> 46:04.946
You must know each and everything about your
child.

46:04.946 --> 46:08.355
Somebody comes and tells me, “My child is
now a drug addict”.

46:08.355 --> 46:10.406
How can that be possible?

46:10.406 --> 46:15.865
In India children, don’t get drug addicts
because all the time the mother is on their

46:15.865 --> 46:18.986
head like a hawk.

46:18.986 --> 46:22.595
She knows where he goes, what he does, she
loves.

46:22.595 --> 46:25.355
But she knows, very well.

46:25.355 --> 46:32.456
Even when we are in college, even when I'm
married, we went home, my mother would ask,

46:32.456 --> 46:34.545
“Where did you go?

46:34.545 --> 46:38.105
Did I not say, come back by 6”.

46:38.105 --> 46:39.436
Even when we are married.

46:39.436 --> 46:45.375
And we are suppose to tell her.

46:45.375 --> 46:47.416
That was the mother’s work.

46:47.416 --> 46:52.966
The child where he goes, what does he do,
and then to say children don’t listen to

46:52.966 --> 46:53.966
me.

46:53.966 --> 47:00.085
Because why the children do not listen, because
you do not discipline them.

47:00.085 --> 47:06.325
Here the atmosphere is very bad agreed, and
the children are very bad, agreed.

47:06.325 --> 47:08.756
Everything is there, agreed.

47:08.756 --> 47:16.075
But if you are a strong mother in your love,
your children will not wander.

47:16.075 --> 47:22.025
See, even now as you know that, all the time
there are all these leaders are hovering around

47:22.025 --> 47:23.575
Me, what is there.

47:23.575 --> 47:27.406
I have no honey with me or anything but they
are just sitting there, just sitting next

47:27.406 --> 47:30.556
to Me, all the leaders.

47:30.556 --> 47:39.436
But this is after realisation but My even
all My nephews you see, they would all come

47:39.436 --> 47:47.305
and sit next to Me, all My in, daughter-in-laws
they would sit next to Me, they would not

47:47.305 --> 47:48.305
leave Me.

47:48.305 --> 47:51.265
And people will start saying, what’s wrong
with you, you're all the time sticking on

47:51.265 --> 47:54.805
to your aunt, what is it?

47:54.805 --> 48:06.125
The concern and they understand that it is
for their benevolence you are telling them.

48:06.125 --> 48:09.105
But yourself should be alright.

48:09.105 --> 48:14.926
As a mother one has to be tolerant, one has
to understand but when you have to tell them

48:14.926 --> 48:17.736
you have to tell them.

48:17.736 --> 48:24.696
If you think you can tell them sharply or
maybe in a proper way but the child should

48:24.696 --> 48:31.396
know that you love the child and that you
love all the children.

48:31.396 --> 48:32.996
It is very subtle.

48:32.996 --> 48:41.585
Like I've seen, once I took a child of one
sahaja yogi with Me to the market, he was

48:41.585 --> 48:46.845
asking "I'll buy this, I'll buy that,[I]’ll
buy that", everything he wanted to buy.

48:46.845 --> 48:49.966
I was wondering What's wrong with this boy.

48:49.966 --> 48:55.045
But say if I take my own grandchildren, they
won't buy, nothing.

48:55.045 --> 48:58.406
Even if you want to buy two pairs of shoes,
"No, no, no, one is sufficient".

48:58.406 --> 48:59.646
If this will be then only.

48:59.646 --> 49:01.255
They'll never ask for anything.

49:01.255 --> 49:07.585
It's a kind of a self-esteem.

49:07.585 --> 49:08.825
They don't want anything.

49:08.825 --> 49:10.966
Same with the wives.

49:10.966 --> 49:16.585
Wives never ask for anything from their husband,
nothing.

49:16.585 --> 49:17.686
Nothing.

49:17.686 --> 49:22.115
The husband will go on asking, please ask
for something, ask for something.

49:22.115 --> 49:25.875
No, they don't want anything.

49:25.875 --> 49:32.085
That is going to be a sahaja yogini mother
and a wife and a shakti.

49:32.085 --> 49:36.115
She has no demands.

49:36.115 --> 49:39.736
Nothing she's asking for.

49:39.736 --> 49:44.615
The one who's a giver, what is she going to
ask.

49:44.615 --> 49:50.785
The one who is a supplier, what is she going
to ask.

49:50.785 --> 49:58.516
So I feel sometimes that the left side, the
women side in Sahaja Yoga is a little bit

49:58.516 --> 50:01.125
going down.

50:01.125 --> 50:02.206
And they have to come up.

50:02.206 --> 50:08.916
First, meditation, the respect of Mother,
teaching the children how to work out Sahaja

50:08.916 --> 50:20.446
Yoga, talking to them about Sahaja Yoga and
not only about food, of cleanliness, of being

50:20.446 --> 50:27.036
nice to others, how to share things.

50:27.036 --> 50:33.535
And telling children about good stories that
you have heard about.

50:33.535 --> 50:38.045
Telling them what is dharma is, talking to
them.

50:38.045 --> 50:40.136
Having a rapport.

50:40.136 --> 50:46.666
This is what you have to understand to make
Sahaja Yoga very strong.

50:46.666 --> 50:51.065
You are the Shakti of Sahaja Yoga take it
from Me.

50:51.065 --> 50:54.325
And you have to work it out that way.

50:54.325 --> 50:57.646
Instead of worrying about small, small things.

50:57.646 --> 51:05.656
Some times I receive letters from the ladies,
sometimes, it really pains me.

51:05.656 --> 51:12.916
I can't understand how they are sahaja yogis.

51:12.916 --> 51:23.686
Our whole system of Sahaja has to be a moral
system that others should see and understand

51:23.686 --> 51:30.285
that what we have achieved in our day to day
life.

51:30.285 --> 51:37.745
Adi Shakti works in day to day life, the smallest
things to the highest.

51:37.745 --> 51:41.546
And all the time you have to learn, all the
time you have to learn.

51:41.546 --> 51:45.855
Whether you are a leader or not a leader,
all the time you must know what it is you

51:45.855 --> 51:47.426
have to know.

51:47.426 --> 51:51.575
I have not known this, I have not known that.

51:51.575 --> 51:57.575
Unless and until you develop that kind of
an attitude that I have to learn that you

51:57.575 --> 52:04.536
humble attitude, that humility, I have to
learn, I have to learn, still I have to learn,

52:04.536 --> 52:07.446
this ego will never come.

52:07.446 --> 52:11.585
Because of this ego you are satisfied with
yourself, that's the sign of an ego.

52:11.585 --> 52:17.335
You don't know how much you are torturing
others, what you are destroying, nothing.

52:17.335 --> 52:22.265
But you feel extremely happy with yourself.

52:22.265 --> 52:35.286
Such a happy go lucky personality sometimes
is living on air.

52:35.286 --> 52:42.535
What I have done today for somebody else,
how have I talked to somebody else, what have

52:42.535 --> 52:44.555
I given to somebody else.

52:44.555 --> 52:50.505
I need not give you presents, there's nothing,
why should I give you presents.

52:50.505 --> 52:54.115
But I give you presents because of My own
satisfaction.

52:54.115 --> 53:02.006
And if I take presents from you, it is for
your own satisfaction.

53:02.006 --> 53:11.575
So what we have to do, in what we find satisfaction,
what do we find satisfaction, just think about

53:11.575 --> 53:15.166
it, what do we find satisfaction in.

53:15.166 --> 53:22.815
My house should be alright, my husband should
be alright, my children should be alright,

53:22.815 --> 53:26.545
my, my, my.

53:26.545 --> 53:41.396
Unless and until this my shifts to another
person, you are still in the realm of maya.

53:41.396 --> 53:51.085
You have to learn this is to think everyday
or write, all of you should write diaries,

53:51.085 --> 54:03.696
what have I done for others, what have I said
to others, what will make or please another

54:03.696 --> 54:04.706
person.

54:04.706 --> 54:13.886
Small, small things can make the life so beautiful.

54:13.886 --> 54:18.615
And also very big things there are for you.

54:18.615 --> 54:25.345
If you do not think, if you do not think you
are very big, all these big things are also

54:25.345 --> 54:27.285
for you.

54:27.285 --> 54:43.345
It's like this, this whole sky can be covered
by one leaf if you see the leaf against the

54:43.345 --> 54:45.986
sky, the leaf shows it’s existence.

54:45.986 --> 55:00.995
In the same way, this whole vision of Sahaja
Yoga can be completely covered by one person

55:00.995 --> 55:13.636
who stands with this great expanse, one person
here and one person there.

55:13.636 --> 55:16.386
It's so remarkable.

55:16.386 --> 55:17.865
It's such a lot of Sahaja Yoga.

55:17.865 --> 55:25.706
There are people who are here and there and
there, so remarkable that if you take their

55:25.706 --> 55:36.105
names also, I just feel I'm drenched into
the ocean of joy.

55:36.105 --> 55:41.926
Only one person, then what about you?

55:41.926 --> 55:45.845
Why can't we do that.

55:45.845 --> 55:55.065
When Adi Shakti is with you reflected when
all Her powers are with you, how much we can

55:55.065 --> 56:02.785
do in this expanse of My vision.

56:02.785 --> 56:16.816
I want to have more and more people who will
be of some visions themselves.

56:16.816 --> 56:21.355
But not small people who just think of their
children, think of food.

56:21.355 --> 56:23.055
No, no, they are not wanted, useless.

56:23.055 --> 56:24.265
They will all drop out.

56:24.265 --> 56:41.555
I hope you have understood where you are,
what do you have, what is created within you

56:41.555 --> 56:45.926
is this Kundalini which has given you all
the knowledge and everything.

56:45.926 --> 56:50.706
But there are so many I know who don't even
know what is this chakra, they don't know,

56:50.706 --> 56:54.095
I mean going to that limit of ignorance.

56:54.095 --> 56:57.555
You have to know all these things.

56:57.555 --> 57:11.396
You have to understand what it is because
this is for you, all for you, all this knowledge.

57:11.396 --> 57:16.646
And the greatest of all is the faith.

57:16.646 --> 57:22.966
Not a faith which is blind but enlightened
faith that you are now one with that Divine

57:22.966 --> 57:26.246
power.

57:26.246 --> 57:28.505
This should really settle you completely.

57:28.505 --> 57:40.006
This is I think that this is one of the most
important pujas because so far guru pujas

57:40.006 --> 57:43.936
have been there, so many people have worshipped
those gurus.

57:43.936 --> 57:48.555
Or maybe My birthday as you think it be, it's
alright.

57:48.555 --> 57:58.345
But I think to understand your own powers
of Kundalini and your powers that are available

57:58.345 --> 58:05.545
to you to the working of Paramchaitanya is
very important.

58:05.545 --> 58:10.575
That will give you confidence, that'll give
you compassion, that'll give you a vision

58:10.575 --> 58:16.305
and that will make you a very great personality,
a very great personality.

58:16.305 --> 58:18.555
What was George Washington?

58:18.555 --> 58:21.375
They said he was great.

58:21.375 --> 58:22.686
What was Abraham Lincoln.

58:22.686 --> 58:24.496
He was great.

58:24.496 --> 58:30.196
But you are all having your self-realisation.

58:30.196 --> 58:36.296
You have to think of the whole universe, the
whole expanse unless and until that brain

58:36.296 --> 58:45.775
develops in you, I'm sure very sure that the
progress of Sahaja Yoga within and without

58:45.775 --> 58:47.436
will be less.

58:47.436 --> 58:50.350
So understand these powers are with you.

58:50.390 --> 58:53.240
You have to utilise them, with humility.

58:53.939 --> 58:59.113
May God bless you.
