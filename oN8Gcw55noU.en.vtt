00:03:13.221 --> 00:03:21.077
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

00:03:21.278 --> 00:03:28.695
that the last work of the Divine,

00:03:28.896 --> 00:03:33.771
of opening the last centre

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:43.917
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

00:04:00.815 --> 00:04:11.611
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

00:04:23.094 --> 00:04:32.690
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

00:04:40.244 --> 00:04:51.387
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

00:04:51.588 --> 00:04:56.843
how things are worked in the heavens.

00:05:05.124 --> 00:05:14.730
It is your fortune and God’s love

00:05:14.931 --> 00:05:20.345
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:34.837
Without this happening, there could not
have been

00:05:36.609 --> 00:05:45.144
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.842
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

00:05:58.043 --> 00:06:05.640
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

00:06:14.983 --> 00:06:25.694
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

00:06:32.656 --> 00:06:41.552
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

00:06:46.077 --> 00:06:53.930
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

00:07:03.182 --> 00:07:15.190
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

00:07:20.112 --> 00:07:25.798
and, with the permutations and combinations

00:07:27.735 --> 00:07:36.624
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

00:07:41.543 --> 00:07:46.038
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

00:07:47.604 --> 00:07:56.936
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

00:08:07.382 --> 00:08:13.046
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

00:08:17.230 --> 00:08:21.546
and the whole thing came on this Earth

00:08:21.747 --> 00:08:29.438
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

00:08:38.591 --> 00:08:43.412
with such a tremendous force,

00:08:46.105 --> 00:08:53.158
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

00:08:58.890 --> 00:09:05.368
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

00:09:05.569 --> 00:09:16.299
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

00:09:31.933 --> 00:09:43.504
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

00:09:51.203 --> 00:10:01.827
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

00:10:06.995 --> 00:10:13.063
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

00:10:13.264 --> 00:10:20.160
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

00:10:20.369 --> 00:10:25.442
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

00:10:25.643 --> 00:10:41.392
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

00:10:51.508 --> 00:10:56.152
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

00:10:56.353 --> 00:11:00.879
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

00:11:10.689 --> 00:11:18.087
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

00:11:24.549 --> 00:11:27.755
on their golden seats,

00:11:30.210 --> 00:11:38.507
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

00:11:43.104 --> 00:11:46.333
like a big dome,

00:11:49.929 --> 00:11:52.981
and opened it,

00:11:53.611 --> 00:11:57.613
and then this torrential rain

00:12:00.297 --> 00:12:04.145
completely drenched me

00:12:08.782 --> 00:12:15.586
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

00:12:23.547 --> 00:12:31.259
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:36.462
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

00:12:50.954 --> 00:13:00.014
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

00:13:05.119 --> 00:13:13.161
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

00:13:18.193 --> 00:13:22.520
and I became absolutely silent.

00:13:31.101 --> 00:13:38.006
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

00:13:49.243 --> 00:13:53.116
But I saw all stones.

00:13:58.142 --> 00:14:07.165
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

00:14:12.730 --> 00:14:18.763
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

00:14:18.964 --> 00:14:24.696
appearing like inflated flames.

00:14:30.387 --> 00:14:38.410
It is a thing which is seen by many people

00:14:42.911 --> 00:14:50.280
but to see it pour that torrential rain

00:14:54.584 --> 00:15:00.295
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

00:15:03.432 --> 00:15:09.899
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

00:15:12.417 --> 00:15:20.230
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

00:15:26.731 --> 00:15:31.576
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

00:15:35.237 --> 00:15:41.037
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

00:15:46.309 --> 00:15:52.048
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

00:15:54.105 --> 00:15:58.867
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

00:15:59.075 --> 00:16:02.584
you cannot see its beauty;

00:16:07.895 --> 00:16:12.119
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.472
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:33.923
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

00:16:34.124 --> 00:16:41.548
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

00:16:52.343 --> 00:16:55.559
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:02.905
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

00:17:19.517 --> 00:17:28.725
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

00:17:36.518 --> 00:17:47.968
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

00:17:55.207 --> 00:18:03.399
and you are drawn out to people

00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:12.326
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

00:18:18.756 --> 00:18:28.293
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

00:18:37.262 --> 00:18:43.085
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

00:18:48.960 --> 00:19:00.591
And even if you desire to ope
the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

00:19:06.665 --> 00:19:14.904
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

00:19:15.105 --> 00:19:19.932
has to be through human beings.

00:19:31.068 --> 00:19:33.823
The power could be with you,

00:19:34.024 --> 00:19:39.589
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

00:19:45.105 --> 00:19:53.527
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

00:19:57.982 --> 00:20:01.104
How to get them?

00:20:03.415 --> 00:20:06.674
How to work it out?

00:20:09.715 --> 00:20:13.792
So I started looking out for people,

00:20:18.508 --> 00:20:23.366
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

00:20:25.734 --> 00:20:31.492
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

00:20:34.701 --> 00:20:40.042
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

00:20:42.607 --> 00:20:46.859
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

00:20:50.059 --> 00:20:58.765
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

00:21:04.132 --> 00:21:08.764
And her brain would be covered with clouds

00:21:10.885 --> 00:21:14.230
and darkness.

00:21:15.122 --> 00:21:20.704
Again and again I had to enlighten it

00:21:22.643 --> 00:21:26.776
but she did not get her Realisation.

00:21:28.913 --> 00:21:35.666
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

00:21:39.548 --> 00:21:43.938
This capacity I had from childhood.

00:21:45.407 --> 00:21:50.595
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

00:21:54.437 --> 00:21:59.221
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

00:22:03.953 --> 00:22:09.072
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

00:22:10.828 --> 00:22:13.690
because I was not living in the forest,

00:22:13.891 --> 00:22:22.546
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

00:22:29.563 --> 00:22:35.219
and they were not that earnest, that
ardent,

00:22:37.777 --> 00:22:42.871
and I had to do this work among them.

00:22:49.269 --> 00:22:52.270
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

00:22:52.471 --> 00:22:56.719
and the false [one] in which they live?

00:23:07.208 --> 00:23:13.393
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

00:23:13.594 --> 00:23:20.307
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

00:23:25.227 --> 00:23:29.038
and it worked in her.

00:23:33.984 --> 00:23:37.389
That was not the happiest day,

00:23:39.995 --> 00:23:45.941
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

00:23:50.776 --> 00:23:55.886
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

00:24:02.808 --> 00:24:07.034
We had a programme in Bordi

00:24:07.948 --> 00:24:12.443
in ’70,

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:19.895
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

00:24:25.235 --> 00:24:32.361
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

00:24:35.625 --> 00:24:40.857
and they started talking of favouritism.

00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:50.015
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

00:24:54.430 --> 00:25:01.879
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

00:25:06.475 --> 00:25:10.377
I was in a great fury.

00:25:12.601 --> 00:25:17.132
I had never gone into such a fury before

00:25:18.603 --> 00:25:22.679
and I lashed out at them.

00:25:26.530 --> 00:25:32.307
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

00:25:36.975 --> 00:25:41.222
That was the greatest moment.

00:25:42.541 --> 00:25:47.482
Then many got, one by one.

00:25:52.244 --> 00:25:55.821
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

00:25:56.022 --> 00:26:00.578
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

00:26:07.254 --> 00:26:12.295
So the mass evolution started.

00:26:16.827 --> 00:26:21.350
Sahasrara is your awareness.

00:26:22.352 --> 00:26:25.928
When it is enlightened

00:26:27.374 --> 00:26:34.659
you get into the technique of the Divine.

00:26:35.852 --> 00:26:39.286
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

00:26:39.487 --> 00:26:43.617
and the technique that you follow.

00:26:50.054 --> 00:26:59.402
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:16.137
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

00:27:21.694 --> 00:27:27.737
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

00:27:31.332 --> 00:27:35.625
When your Sahasrara opens out

00:27:36.524 --> 00:27:44.985
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

00:27:50.526 --> 00:27:56.829
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

00:28:02.784 --> 00:28:11.512
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

00:28:16.322 --> 00:28:24.520
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

00:28:29.029 --> 00:28:35.143
and your nadis get enlightened;

00:28:39.748 --> 00:28:42.437
not all of them,

00:28:42.638 --> 00:28:45.209
quite a lot of them;

00:28:45.410 --> 00:28:49.881
not all the length,

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.950
but quite the peripheries.

00:28:57.610 --> 00:29:02.282
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

00:29:04.141 --> 00:29:07.327
So many things happen

00:29:07.528 --> 00:29:14.351
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

00:29:19.496 --> 00:29:24.179
With the light you see their relative
positions.

00:29:27.507 --> 00:29:34.971
I mean you do not see, but it work
in your conscious mind.

00:29:40.806 --> 00:29:46.426
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

00:29:55.585 --> 00:30:03.821
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

00:30:09.862 --> 00:30:13.515
It becomes one with your attention.

00:30:14.550 --> 00:30:18.632
Wherever your attention goes

00:30:19.468 --> 00:30:23.771
you act in a collective way.

00:30:25.248 --> 00:30:31.335
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

00:30:33.416 --> 00:30:39.312
The attention itself is effective.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:45.728
Your attention is very important,

00:30:48.071 --> 00:30:52.584
your desires are even more important.

00:30:55.903 --> 00:31:04.049
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

00:31:09.307 --> 00:31:12.648
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

00:31:12.849 --> 00:31:20.608
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

00:31:28.164 --> 00:31:32.112
The priorities change very fast.

00:31:34.614 --> 00:31:40.074
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

00:31:41.822 --> 00:31:46.049
may not find that happening

00:31:49.504 --> 00:31:53.912
but those who are over mentally developed,

00:31:55.621 --> 00:32:01.840
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

00:32:04.445 --> 00:32:08.070
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

00:32:08.271 --> 00:32:12.929
They want to see that it is logical.

00:32:20.208 --> 00:32:25.075
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

00:32:29.713 --> 00:32:33.926
We have some people like that among us.

00:32:35.983 --> 00:32:40.050
They just became and they never questioned.

00:32:43.552 --> 00:32:46.518
They just settled down.

00:32:48.083 --> 00:32:53.105
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

00:32:53.326 --> 00:32:57.546
above all they are spiritual.

00:32:59.889 --> 00:33:02.393
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

00:33:02.594 --> 00:33:06.634
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

00:33:11.938 --> 00:33:15.233
First of all you have to put down your ego

00:33:15.434 --> 00:33:20.192
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

00:33:24.184 --> 00:33:27.749
Also the super-ego must be reduced

00:33:27.950 --> 00:33:34.812
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

00:33:40.488 --> 00:33:44.601
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

00:33:44.802 --> 00:33:52.678
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

00:33:59.737 --> 00:34:06.487
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

00:34:11.314 --> 00:34:20.136
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:29.027
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

00:34:30.775 --> 00:34:33.905
it closes back.

00:34:34.106 --> 00:34:37.614
That’s like a poison.

00:34:38.743 --> 00:34:43.913
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

00:34:48.026 --> 00:34:52.147
If you go about with the poison

00:34:54.832 --> 00:34:58.598
then it again closes.

00:35:02.068 --> 00:35:09.111
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

00:35:10.203 --> 00:35:14.720
and all other problems of the ego,

00:35:14.921 --> 00:35:20.485
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

00:35:22.757 --> 00:35:27.210
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

00:35:27.776 --> 00:35:33.329
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

00:35:35.976 --> 00:35:38.937
and wrong books,

00:35:39.138 --> 00:35:42.267
from wrong parents maybe,

00:35:42.468 --> 00:35:45.731
from a wrong country,

00:35:48.494 --> 00:35:52.276
from a wrong livelihood

00:35:53.389 --> 00:36:00.513
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

00:36:05.688 --> 00:36:11.445
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

00:36:15.812 --> 00:36:18.211
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

00:36:18.412 --> 00:36:25.756
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

00:36:32.749 --> 00:36:37.395
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:43.351
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

00:36:44.702 --> 00:36:50.640
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:54.867
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

00:37:01.281 --> 00:37:07.501
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

00:37:13.574 --> 00:37:17.893
We have to have more and more channels

00:37:19.378 --> 00:37:25.010
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

00:37:29.448 --> 00:37:36.963
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

00:37:42.616 --> 00:37:50.433
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

00:37:55.736 --> 00:38:00.150
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

00:38:03.843 --> 00:38:08.874
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

00:38:14.892 --> 00:38:20.306
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

00:38:26.386 --> 00:38:31.636
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

00:38:31.845 --> 00:38:39.471
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

00:38:52.178 --> 00:38:55.498
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

00:38:55.699 --> 00:38:59.835
that he should not have bad company,

00:39:04.177 --> 00:39:09.074
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

00:39:11.782 --> 00:39:15.774
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

00:39:15.975 --> 00:39:22.547
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

00:39:31.073 --> 00:39:37.142
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

00:39:37.343 --> 00:39:46.487
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:08.065
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

00:40:16.042 --> 00:40:20.520
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

00:40:22.634 --> 00:40:27.741
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

00:40:30.806 --> 00:40:36.147
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

00:40:37.490 --> 00:40:44.044
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

00:40:49.276 --> 00:40:54.223
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:01.508
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

00:41:04.145 --> 00:41:10.514
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

00:41:17.801 --> 00:41:22.346
so all other things must drop out.

00:41:26.523 --> 00:41:31.547
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

00:41:35.866 --> 00:41:39.115
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

00:41:39.316 --> 00:41:45.803
that you can really correct yourself

00:41:52.494 --> 00:42:01.342
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

00:42:07.631 --> 00:42:13.326
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

00:42:16.678 --> 00:42:22.469
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:30.105
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

00:42:34.139 --> 00:42:37.035
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

00:42:37.236 --> 00:42:42.967
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

00:42:51.095 --> 00:42:55.133
For that tolerance is needed,

00:42:57.413 --> 00:43:00.511
wisdom is needed,

00:43:00.712 --> 00:43:05.714
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

00:43:10.637 --> 00:43:13.484
which you are,

00:43:16.391 --> 00:43:20.334
and you should talk like a prophet.

00:43:25.010 --> 00:43:29.819
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

00:43:34.066 --> 00:43:40.561
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

00:43:41.745 --> 00:43:47.752
This is not insincere or acting

00:43:50.413 --> 00:43:53.574
because now you are awakened.

00:43:55.274 --> 00:44:02.909
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

00:44:17.797 --> 00:44:31.171
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

00:44:38.434 --> 00:44:48.849
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

00:44:54.216 --> 00:45:00.797
one has to watch one’s own growth.

00:45:03.751 --> 00:45:08.810
Never justify your wrongdoings.

00:45:13.630 --> 00:45:20.289
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

00:45:23.482 --> 00:45:28.059
We have no time to think about oneself.

00:45:31.640 --> 00:45:36.164
You have to think of others

00:45:36.365 --> 00:45:40.011
because others are also in your brain;

00:45:42.425 --> 00:45:46.375
and when you start thinking of others,

00:45:46.758 --> 00:45:52.532
talking to them about their resurrection,

00:45:55.375 --> 00:46:05.251
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

00:46:12.197 --> 00:46:15.802
The sensitivity will also increase,

00:46:16.749 --> 00:46:19.688
the depth will also come in.

00:46:20.865 --> 00:46:26.901
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

00:46:34.828 --> 00:46:38.763
So you have to come out of your shells

00:46:42.479 --> 00:46:45.931
and spread your wings.

00:46:46.694 --> 00:46:52.025
All small things of mind

00:46:55.519 --> 00:46:58.286
must be given up.

00:47:01.986 --> 00:47:09.312
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

00:47:16.248 --> 00:47:19.830
which has to give support,

00:47:20.760 --> 00:47:24.548
guidance, help

00:47:24.749 --> 00:47:29.601
and awakening to thousands.

00:47:30.678 --> 00:47:37.603
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

00:47:40.756 --> 00:47:47.084
establishes a new dynamism

00:47:48.792 --> 00:47:51.771
in this country,

00:47:52.892 --> 00:47:55.409
I am sure

00:47:56.260 --> 00:48:02.245
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

00:48:09.302 --> 00:48:14.146
It will resound into their brains,

00:48:17.728 --> 00:48:22.625
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:33.065
and they will start thinking afresh.

00:48:37.423 --> 00:48:42.859
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

00:48:46.853 --> 00:48:55.464
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

00:49:00.879 --> 00:49:04.300
They’ll come to right conclusions.

00:49:07.063 --> 00:49:11.521
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

00:49:18.268 --> 00:49:22.915
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

00:49:24.814 --> 00:49:29.565
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

00:49:32.290 --> 00:49:35.421
The way you treat your Spirit

00:49:35.622 --> 00:49:41.236
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

00:49:48.730 --> 00:49:56.618
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

00:50:00.850 --> 00:50:06.256
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

00:50:11.393 --> 00:50:17.925
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

00:50:23.896 --> 00:50:28.491
And then you can become a subtle being.

00:50:30.048 --> 00:50:34.459
Through your conscious effort,

00:50:34.660 --> 00:50:40.817
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

00:50:46.626 --> 00:50:50.852
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

00:50:51.053 --> 00:50:58.206
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

00:51:04.097 --> 00:51:06.623
When you start developing higher and
higher,

00:51:06.824 --> 00:51:12.969
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

00:51:20.072 --> 00:51:23.442
You may not have any interest in many
things

00:51:23.643 --> 00:51:31.162
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

00:51:36.378 --> 00:51:42.907
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

00:51:49.266 --> 00:51:58.437
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

00:52:04.907 --> 00:52:11.317
So you become the master of your brain

00:52:12.446 --> 00:52:17.615
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

00:52:19.587 --> 00:52:25.556
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

00:52:25.757 --> 00:52:31.473
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

00:52:36.625 --> 00:52:40.927
And the light of that expands

00:52:41.985 --> 00:52:47.115
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

00:52:50.332 --> 00:52:54.467
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

00:52:54.668 --> 00:52:58.836
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

00:52:59.037 --> 00:53:05.239
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

00:53:17.779 --> 00:53:26.222
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

00:53:31.081 --> 00:53:35.600
their obstinacy

00:53:35.801 --> 00:53:39.984
and childish pranks.

00:53:42.643 --> 00:53:45.887
Let the man rise

00:53:47.367 --> 00:53:53.563
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

00:53:56.834 --> 00:54:05.079
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

00:54:15.711 --> 00:54:26.630
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

00:54:26.839 --> 00:54:33.411
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

00:54:43.068 --> 00:54:47.046
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

00:54:47.247 --> 00:54:52.144
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

00:55:02.604 --> 00:55:06.614
That is what is your job,

00:55:08.631 --> 00:55:14.255
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

00:55:18.534 --> 00:55:26.848
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

00:55:27.049 --> 00:55:35.764
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

00:55:49.439 --> 00:55:53.681
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

00:55:53.882 --> 00:55:59.594
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

00:55:59.795 --> 00:56:07.099
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

00:56:19.537 --> 00:56:23.329
neglected by all the deities,

00:56:24.688 --> 00:56:30.359
because human beings really went very
wrong.

00:56:35.733 --> 00:56:43.867
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

00:56:46.670 --> 00:56:51.010
because this is the attention,

00:56:54.012 --> 00:57:02.511
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

00:57:15.019 --> 00:57:21.589
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

00:57:25.511 --> 00:57:31.964
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

00:57:33.783 --> 00:57:37.461
and  towards the eternal life.

00:57:38.517 --> 00:57:42.888
Is [a] very important country,

00:57:44.081 --> 00:57:49.395
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

00:57:52.928 --> 00:57:59.707
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

00:58:04.558 --> 00:58:08.813
They have to change their methods

00:58:09.164 --> 00:58:11.672
and styles.

00:58:12.270 --> 00:58:16.375
They should be very mild, gentle

00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:20.920
and healthy people

00:58:23.176 --> 00:58:28.531
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

00:58:30.913 --> 00:58:34.633
so that when others see them

00:58:35.992 --> 00:58:39.542
[they] find that superiority in them.

00:58:43.416 --> 00:58:47.830
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

00:58:48.031 --> 00:58:51.023
I am very happy about you.

00:58:56.707 --> 00:59:00.096
May God bless you all.

00:59:01.019 --> 00:59:05.314
Now I bless all the other centres,

00:59:06.753 --> 00:59:10.664
who have prayed and are praying;

00:59:10.865 --> 00:59:16.375
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

00:59:17.504 --> 00:59:20.506
an enlightened one,

00:59:20.692 --> 00:59:25.704
that will separate them from their small
shells.

00:59:27.586 --> 00:59:31.932
Let them expand so much,

00:59:32.133 --> 00:59:38.899
that they become one with the whole.

00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:42.234
May God bless you all.

00:59:49.045 --> 00:59:52.219
May God bless you.

00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:55.645
Good (…)
