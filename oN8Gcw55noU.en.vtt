03:13.221 --> 03:21.077
Today, it’s a great day for all of us,
the seekers,

03:21.278 --> 03:28.695
that the last work of the Divine,

03:28.896 --> 03:33.771
of opening the last centre

03:35.950 --> 03:43.917
in the Great Primordial Being, was done
on the 5th of May 1970.

04:00.815 --> 04:11.611
It is the greatest event of all the
spiritual happenings of the Universe.

04:23.094 --> 04:32.690
It was done with very great care and
great adjustments.

04:40.244 --> 04:51.387
It is not in the limits of human
understanding,

04:51.588 --> 04:56.843
how things are worked in the heavens.

05:05.124 --> 05:14.730
It is your fortune and God’s love

05:14.931 --> 05:20.345
that has worked out this wondrous miracle.

05:30.167 --> 05:34.837
Without this happening, there could not
have been

05:36.609 --> 05:45.144
a possibility to give mass Realisation
to people.

05:53.110 --> 05:57.842
One could have done it for one or two
persons here and there,

05:58.043 --> 06:05.640
but to give such a mass awakening could
not have been possible.

06:14.983 --> 06:25.694
As you know, in the Sahasrara, there are
the seats of the seven main chakras.

06:32.656 --> 06:41.552
There are one thousand nadis or, as they
call it, flames,

06:46.077 --> 06:53.930
and they all have each sixteen thousand
powers.

07:03.182 --> 07:15.190
Every nadi deals with a particular type
of a person

07:20.112 --> 07:25.798
and, with the permutations and combinations

07:27.735 --> 07:36.624
of all these nadis, human beings are
looked after.

07:41.543 --> 07:46.038
As soon as Sahasrara was opened,

07:47.604 --> 07:56.936
the whole atmosphere was filled with
tremendous chaitanya

08:07.382 --> 08:13.046
and there was tremendous light in the sky,

08:17.230 --> 08:21.546
and the whole thing came on this Earth

08:21.747 --> 08:29.438
as if a torrential rain or a waterfall,

08:38.591 --> 08:43.412
with such a tremendous force,

08:46.105 --> 08:53.158
as if I was unaware and got stupefied.

08:58.890 --> 09:05.368
The happening was so unexpected and
so tremendous

09:05.569 --> 09:16.299
that I was stunned and I became completely
silent at its grandeur.

09:31.933 --> 09:43.504
I saw the primordial Kundalini rising like
a big furnace,

09:51.203 --> 10:01.827
and the furnace was very silent but
a burning appearance it had:

10:06.995 --> 10:13.063
as if you heat up some metal and it has
many colours, in the same way,

10:13.264 --> 10:20.160
the Kundalini showed up like a huge
furnace, you can say;

10:20.369 --> 10:25.442
a furnace which is like a tunnel,

10:25.643 --> 10:41.392
where you see these plants you have for
coal burning to create electricity;

10:51.508 --> 10:56.152
and it stretched like a telescope one after
another,

10:56.353 --> 11:00.879
it came out, shoot, shoot, shoot,
like that.

11:10.689 --> 11:18.087
And the Deities came and sat on their
seats,

11:24.549 --> 11:27.755
on their golden seats,

11:30.210 --> 11:38.507
and then they lifted the whole of the head,

11:43.104 --> 11:46.333
like a big dome,

11:49.929 --> 11:52.981
and opened it,

11:53.611 --> 11:57.613
and then this torrential rain

12:00.297 --> 12:04.145
completely drenched me

12:08.782 --> 12:15.586
and I started seeing all that and got lost
into the joy.

12:23.547 --> 12:31.259
It was like an artist seeing its own
creation fulfilled.

12:31.460 --> 12:36.462
I felt the joy of great fulfilment.

12:50.954 --> 13:00.014
After coming out of that beautiful
experience

13:05.119 --> 13:13.161
I looked around and I saw human beings
so blind

13:18.193 --> 13:22.520
and I became absolutely silent.

13:31.101 --> 13:38.006
Then I desired that I should get the cups
to fill this nectar.

13:49.243 --> 13:53.116
But I saw all stones.

13:58.142 --> 14:07.165
Sahasrara is the most beautiful part
of your being.

14:12.730 --> 14:18.763
It is a big lotus with one thousand petals
of different colours

14:18.964 --> 14:24.696
appearing like inflated flames.

14:30.387 --> 14:38.410
It is a thing which is seen by many people

14:42.911 --> 14:50.280
but to see it pour that torrential rain

14:54.584 --> 15:00.295
was like these flames becoming a fountain,

15:03.432 --> 15:09.899
fountain of colours and of fragrance.

15:12.417 --> 15:20.230
Can you think of a flower pouring
its colour and its fragrance around?

15:26.731 --> 15:31.576
People have written very little about
Sahasrara,

15:35.237 --> 15:41.037
because whatever they have seen
is from outside

15:46.309 --> 15:52.048
and it’s not possible for them to go
from inside.

15:54.105 --> 15:58.867
Even if you reach from inside, if the whole
Sahasrara is not opened out,

15:59.075 --> 16:02.584
you cannot see its beauty;

16:07.895 --> 16:12.119
because when it is closed, the whole
of it, the total,

16:12.320 --> 16:18.472
then you just pass through a little
aperture and get out of it.

16:24.290 --> 16:33.923
But just imagine a huge big petaled,
thousand petaled lotus,

16:34.124 --> 16:41.548
and you are sitting inside, in the corona
and looking at all these petals —

16:52.343 --> 16:55.559
all very beautifully coloured, and
fragrant,

16:55.760 --> 17:02.905
and pulsating with the bliss and the joy.

17:19.517 --> 17:28.725
To remain into Sahasrara, on that position,
is the ideal situation.

17:36.518 --> 17:47.968
But then, after the silence, you are filled
with tremendous compassion and love,

17:55.207 --> 18:03.399
and you are drawn out to people

18:03.600 --> 18:12.326
who haven’t yet known what is having eyes.

18:18.756 --> 18:28.293
And thus you try to put your attention
to the Sahasrara of millions of people,

18:37.262 --> 18:43.085
and then you start seeing the problems
that exist in the Sahasrara.

18:48.960 --> 19:00.591
And even if you desire to ope
the Sahasrara it is a very difficult thing

19:06.665 --> 19:14.904
because the channelising from the Divine
to human beings

19:15.105 --> 19:19.932
has to be through human beings.

19:31.068 --> 19:33.823
The power could be with you,

19:34.024 --> 19:39.589
but it has to be channelised through
human element.

19:45.105 --> 19:53.527
All My life I had not known many
realised-souls.

19:57.982 --> 20:01.104
How to get them?

20:03.415 --> 20:06.674
How to work it out?

20:09.715 --> 20:13.792
So I started looking out for people,

20:18.508 --> 20:23.366
and I met one old lady of seventy years,

20:25.734 --> 20:31.492
and she was very perturbed about
something very gross;

20:34.701 --> 20:40.042
and when she came to Me she felt
very peaceful.

20:42.607 --> 20:46.859
Her Sahasrara was very worn out.

20:50.059 --> 20:58.765
And in My company she would think
of something else, not of the Spirit.

21:04.132 --> 21:08.764
And her brain would be covered with clouds

21:10.885 --> 21:14.230
and darkness.

21:15.122 --> 21:20.704
Again and again I had to enlighten it

21:22.643 --> 21:26.776
but she did not get her Realisation.

21:28.913 --> 21:35.666
Most of the people who came to Me
in the beginning came for getting cured.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.938
This capacity I had from childhood.

21:45.407 --> 21:50.595
And I could also give Realisation to a few
people before,

21:54.437 --> 21:59.221
but they had to be very earnest – ardent.

22:03.953 --> 22:09.072
I didn’t meet any one of that quality

22:10.828 --> 22:13.690
because I was not living in the forest,

22:13.891 --> 22:22.546
I was living as a normal human being
among other normal human beings,

22:29.563 --> 22:35.219
and they were not that earnest, that
ardent,

22:37.777 --> 22:42.871
and I had to do this work among them.

22:49.269 --> 22:52.270
How to talk to them about the real world
that exists

22:52.471 --> 22:56.719
and the false [one] in which they live?

23:07.208 --> 23:13.393
And one lady, the first one who got
Realisation, just came to see Me

23:13.594 --> 23:20.307
because she was possessed with the idea
of seeking, she thought,

23:25.227 --> 23:29.038
and it worked in her.

23:33.984 --> 23:37.389
That was not the happiest day,

23:39.995 --> 23:45.941
because she’s one of those who get
individually Realisation.

23:50.776 --> 23:55.886
With this great happening many should get
at a time.

24:02.808 --> 24:07.034
We had a programme in Bordi

24:07.948 --> 24:12.443
in ’70,

24:12.930 --> 24:19.895
and there, first, one gentleman got
Realisation in the evening.

24:25.235 --> 24:32.361
Next day there were negative forces acting
[in the] morning time,

24:35.625 --> 24:40.857
and they started talking of favouritism.

24:44.040 --> 24:50.015
I could see in the atmosphere the
vibrations were going wrong.

24:54.430 --> 25:01.879
In the evening I took up a very strong,
firm attitude.

25:06.475 --> 25:10.377
I was in a great fury.

25:12.601 --> 25:17.132
I had never gone into such a fury before

25:18.603 --> 25:22.679
and I lashed out at them.

25:26.530 --> 25:32.307
Surprisingly, twelve of them got
Realisation,

25:36.975 --> 25:41.222
That was the greatest moment.

25:42.541 --> 25:47.482
Then many got, one by one.

25:52.244 --> 25:55.821
Three of them who were travelling back,
got Realisation.

25:56.022 --> 26:00.578
Suddenly, in the train, they felt
the vibrations.

26:07.254 --> 26:12.295
So the mass evolution started.

26:16.827 --> 26:21.350
Sahasrara is your awareness.

26:22.352 --> 26:25.928
When it is enlightened

26:27.374 --> 26:34.659
you get into the technique of the Divine.

26:35.852 --> 26:39.286
Now there are two techniques:
the technique of the Divine,

26:39.487 --> 26:43.617
and the technique that you follow.

26:50.054 --> 26:59.402
You cannot act as Divine, but you can use
the Divine power and manoeuvre it.

27:09.860 --> 27:16.137
For example, Divine looks after all
the Universal happenings:

27:21.694 --> 27:27.737
every minutest particle is controlled
by Divine.

27:31.332 --> 27:35.625
When your Sahasrara opens out

27:36.524 --> 27:44.985
and your Kundalini touches the fontanelle
bone,

27:50.526 --> 27:56.829
sort of an igniting force is ready in your
Sahasrara,

28:02.784 --> 28:11.512
and as soon as the fontanelle bone area
opens up through the Brahmarandhra,

28:16.322 --> 28:24.520
the grace of your Spirit ignites that
igniting force

28:29.029 --> 28:35.143
and your nadis get enlightened;

28:39.748 --> 28:42.437
not all of them,

28:42.638 --> 28:45.209
quite a lot of them;

28:45.410 --> 28:49.881
not all the length,

28:50.700 --> 28:54.950
but quite the peripheries.

28:57.610 --> 29:02.282
That’s how you get your enlightenment.

29:04.141 --> 29:07.327
So many things happen

29:07.528 --> 29:14.351
because, also, of your seven centres
being in the Sahasrara.

29:19.496 --> 29:24.179
With the light you see their relative
positions.

29:27.507 --> 29:34.971
I mean you do not see, but it work
in your conscious mind.

29:40.806 --> 29:46.426
Your conscious mind feels that integration
within you.

29:55.585 --> 30:03.821
The rationality which is separated from
the heart becomes one with the heart.

30:09.862 --> 30:13.515
It becomes one with your attention.

30:14.550 --> 30:18.632
Wherever your attention goes

30:19.468 --> 30:23.771
you act in a collective way.

30:25.248 --> 30:31.335
All the activities of your attention are
blessed.

30:33.416 --> 30:39.312
The attention itself is effective.

30:40.790 --> 30:45.728
Your attention is very important,

30:48.071 --> 30:52.584
your desires are even more important.

30:55.903 --> 31:04.049
Because it is such an integrated thing,
your desires and your attention become one.

31:09.307 --> 31:12.648
Whatever is good for the Spirit you desire

31:12.849 --> 31:20.608
and your attention goes to the thing,
whichever is emitting the Spiritual power.

31:28.164 --> 31:32.112
The priorities change very fast.

31:34.614 --> 31:40.074
Those people who are primitive and
not evolved

31:41.822 --> 31:46.049
may not find that happening

31:49.504 --> 31:53.912
but those who are over mentally developed,

31:55.621 --> 32:01.840
they actually have an attention which
they try to test.

32:04.445 --> 32:08.070
They first want to see how to raise
the Kundalini.

32:08.271 --> 32:12.929
They want to see that it is logical.

32:20.208 --> 32:25.075
For a balanced person there’s no
questioning at all.

32:29.713 --> 32:33.926
We have some people like that among us.

32:35.983 --> 32:40.050
They just became and they never questioned.

32:43.552 --> 32:46.518
They just settled down.

32:48.083 --> 32:53.105
They are innocent, they are intelligent,

32:53.326 --> 32:57.546
above all they are spiritual.

32:59.889 --> 33:02.393
But whatever may be the defect
in the quality

33:02.594 --> 33:06.634
can be corrected through your Sahasrara.

33:11.938 --> 33:15.233
First of all you have to put down your ego

33:15.434 --> 33:20.192
because if ego is there it presses
the Sahasrara.

33:24.184 --> 33:27.749
Also the super-ego must be reduced

33:27.950 --> 33:34.812
because it also presses the Sahasrara
and gives pain.

33:40.488 --> 33:44.601
So to keep the Sahasrara in its healthy
state

33:44.802 --> 33:52.678
one has to understand that the priorities
are to be changed.

33:59.737 --> 34:06.487
Some people take time, so they have to put
some deliberate effort.

34:11.314 --> 34:20.136
There are many books, if you read them,
they suggest anti-God activities.

34:24.701 --> 34:29.027
An enlightened Sahasrara doesn’t like it,

34:30.775 --> 34:33.905
it closes back.

34:34.106 --> 34:37.614
That’s like a poison.

34:38.743 --> 34:43.913
It doesn’t like any poisonous thought
to come in the mind.

34:48.026 --> 34:52.147
If you go about with the poison

34:54.832 --> 34:58.598
then it again closes.

35:02.068 --> 35:09.111
In the same way the people who are hot
tempered, very much hot tempered,

35:10.203 --> 35:14.720
and all other problems of the ego,

35:14.921 --> 35:20.485
if they try to suppress the Sahasrara

35:22.757 --> 35:27.210
[then] also the Sahasrara starts closing
down.

35:27.776 --> 35:33.329
Those people who have had conditioning
from wrong gurus,

35:35.976 --> 35:38.937
and wrong books,

35:39.138 --> 35:42.267
from wrong parents maybe,

35:42.468 --> 35:45.731
from a wrong country,

35:48.494 --> 35:52.276
from a wrong livelihood

35:53.389 --> 36:00.513
also do not allow the Sahasrara to grow
in it’s healthy way.

36:05.688 --> 36:11.445
It is only the Sahasrara [that] has
to grow, not the Spirit.

36:15.812 --> 36:18.211
The more sensitive the Sahasrara is,

36:18.412 --> 36:25.756
the more it receives the Spiritual
qualities of the Spirit.

36:32.749 --> 36:37.395
Actually the peace is felt in
the Sahasrara.

36:39.080 --> 36:43.351
The bliss is also felt in the Sahasrara

36:44.702 --> 36:50.640
because that is the brain, and the brain
is the epitome of our nervous system,

36:50.841 --> 36:54.867
central nervous system, of consciousness
itself.

37:01.281 --> 37:07.501
So only, merely, by opening Sahasrara,
the work is not done.

37:13.574 --> 37:17.893
We have to have more and more channels

37:19.378 --> 37:25.010
who will act on these nadis with their
different powers,

37:29.448 --> 37:36.963
and who can work it out in a proper
systematic manner.

37:42.616 --> 37:50.433
But those people who indulge into wasteful
habits after Realisation,

37:55.736 --> 38:00.150
obstruct the flow of the nadis,

38:03.843 --> 38:08.874
and really are very harmful for the Virata.

38:14.892 --> 38:20.306
Such people should really leave Sahaja
Yoga and spare [us].

38:26.386 --> 38:31.636
Or such people should be asked to leave
and one should severe relations

38:31.845 --> 38:39.471
with such people who is standing against
such a great work of the Divine.

38:52.178 --> 38:55.498
The one who wants to develop on Sahasrara
should know

38:55.699 --> 38:59.835
that he should not have bad company,

39:04.177 --> 39:09.074
but always have the company of the other
sahaja yogis.

39:11.782 --> 39:15.774
He should not have his own holidays
and her own time,

39:15.975 --> 39:22.547
but most of the time he should spend in
the company of other sahaja yogis.

39:31.073 --> 39:37.142
After the Sahasrara, when you are above
Sahasrara then you can see

39:37.343 --> 39:46.487
that it is very important that all these
nadis must be kept together.

39:58.900 --> 40:08.065
And all the centres and the Deities must
be kept awakened and integrated.

40:16.042 --> 40:20.520
This can be done even with a conscious
effort

40:22.634 --> 40:27.741
by watching yourself, your thoughts.

40:30.806 --> 40:36.147
You will start seeing your ego and your
superego.

40:37.490 --> 40:44.044
You will be able to see how you cheat
yourself and you are dishonest to yourself,

40:49.276 --> 40:54.223
how you are convincing yourself that
you are very good,

40:57.121 --> 41:01.508
how you are enjoying a ego trip.

41:04.145 --> 41:10.514
Sahaja Yoga is for people who are Spirits

41:17.801 --> 41:22.346
so all other things must drop out.

41:26.523 --> 41:31.547
All misidentifications must be dropped out.

41:35.866 --> 41:39.115
One can do it through conscious mind,
as I said,

41:39.316 --> 41:45.803
that you can really correct yourself

41:52.494 --> 42:01.342
because after Realisation whatever you
desire becomes a part of the Divine desire

42:07.631 --> 42:13.326
and whatever you do becomes a part
of the Divine action.

42:16.678 --> 42:22.469
So one has to remember that with
conscious effort

42:22.670 --> 42:30.105
we can find out ourselves and see if we
are really honest about it.

42:34.139 --> 42:37.035
If one is honest one can see that
collectivity

42:37.236 --> 42:42.967
is the only way to expand your Sahasrara.

42:51.095 --> 42:55.133
For that tolerance is needed,

42:57.413 --> 43:00.511
wisdom is needed,

43:00.712 --> 43:05.714
and a stature is needed of a prophet,

43:10.637 --> 43:13.484
which you are,

43:16.391 --> 43:20.334
and you should talk like a prophet.

43:25.010 --> 43:29.819
Actually, you have to educate yourself.

43:34.066 --> 43:40.561
How does a prophet speaks? How does
a prophet speak?

43:41.745 --> 43:47.752
This is not insincere or acting

43:50.413 --> 43:53.574
because now you are awakened.

43:55.274 --> 44:02.909
When you are not awakened then whatever
you do like this is artificial.

44:17.797 --> 44:31.171
Sahasrara is the controlling, guiding,
evolving force

44:38.434 --> 44:48.849
and so to keep it absolutely ready for
growth and expansion

44:54.216 --> 45:00.797
one has to watch one’s own growth.

45:03.751 --> 45:08.810
Never justify your wrongdoings.

45:13.630 --> 45:20.289
If you start justifying, you are actually
thinking about that.

45:23.482 --> 45:28.059
We have no time to think about oneself.

45:31.640 --> 45:36.164
You have to think of others

45:36.365 --> 45:40.011
because others are also in your brain;

45:42.425 --> 45:46.375
and when you start thinking of others,

45:46.758 --> 45:52.532
talking to them about their resurrection,

45:55.375 --> 46:05.251
your Sahasrara will definitely increase
in its size and in its sensibility.

46:12.197 --> 46:15.802
The sensitivity will also increase,

46:16.749 --> 46:19.688
the depth will also come in.

46:20.865 --> 46:26.901
It is just like a tree, when it grows,
its roots spread very strong.

46:34.828 --> 46:38.763
So you have to come out of your shells

46:42.479 --> 46:45.931
and spread your wings.

46:46.694 --> 46:52.025
All small things of mind

46:55.519 --> 46:58.286
must be given up.

47:01.986 --> 47:09.312
You have to live like a very, huge,
big personality

47:16.248 --> 47:19.830
which has to give support,

47:20.760 --> 47:24.548
guidance, help

47:24.749 --> 47:29.601
and awakening to thousands.

47:30.678 --> 47:37.603
If this Sahasrara Day in France,

47:40.756 --> 47:47.084
establishes a new dynamism

47:48.792 --> 47:51.771
in this country,

47:52.892 --> 47:55.409
I am sure

47:56.260 --> 48:02.245
that it will catch up with the thought
of the people.

48:09.302 --> 48:14.146
It will resound into their brains,

48:17.728 --> 48:22.625
their unconscious will transmit it into
their being

48:27.500 --> 48:33.065
and they will start thinking afresh.

48:37.423 --> 48:42.859
Now, new breakthroughs will take place,

48:46.853 --> 48:55.464
and people will start going towards
Truth logically.

49:00.879 --> 49:04.300
They’ll come to right conclusions.

49:07.063 --> 49:11.521
They’ll drop out all that is useless and
wasteful.

49:18.268 --> 49:22.915
Sahasrara is the throne for the Spirit

49:24.814 --> 49:29.565
and the bigger is the king, the bigger
is the throne.

49:32.290 --> 49:35.421
The way you treat your Spirit

49:35.622 --> 49:41.236
is expressed through the way you
have your Sahasrara.

49:48.730 --> 49:56.618
As it is the seven chakras are seated
in the Sahasrara,

50:00.850 --> 50:06.256
you become the master of all these seven
chakras,

50:11.393 --> 50:17.925
and that’s how you can do Realisation,
you can give Realisation.

50:23.896 --> 50:28.491
And then you can become a subtle being.

50:30.048 --> 50:34.459
Through your conscious effort,

50:34.660 --> 50:40.817
you can enter into the beings of others and
raise their Kundalini and correct them.

50:46.626 --> 50:50.852
Enlightenment of the Sahasrara also gives
you a new sight

50:51.053 --> 50:58.206
to see all the sukshmas, all the subtle
things in the atmosphere.

51:04.097 --> 51:06.623
When you start developing higher and
higher,

51:06.824 --> 51:12.969
you can see the vibrations as lights around
you.

51:20.072 --> 51:23.442
You may not have any interest in many
things

51:23.643 --> 51:31.162
but you’ll be amazed how you become
the master of so many things.

51:36.378 --> 51:42.907
As if your brain is materialising whatever
you have been desiring.

51:49.266 --> 51:58.437
And this is what is Krishna promised, who
is actually the Virata.

52:04.907 --> 52:11.317
So you become the master of your brain

52:12.446 --> 52:17.615
because actually the Spirit is master
of the brain.

52:19.587 --> 52:25.556
The more you start bringing Spirit into
your attention,

52:25.757 --> 52:31.473
the more the Sahasrara increases
in its size.

52:36.625 --> 52:40.927
And the light of that expands

52:41.985 --> 52:47.115
and you become [a] more powerful
sahaja yogi.

52:50.332 --> 52:54.467
This is the greatest thing also for God
Almighty

52:54.668 --> 52:58.836
to see that this has happened,
so that He can,

52:59.037 --> 53:05.239
for the time being, postpone His anger
and wrath;

53:17.779 --> 53:26.222
so that He can forgive human beings
for their mistakes,

53:31.081 --> 53:35.600
their obstinacy

53:35.801 --> 53:39.984
and childish pranks.

53:42.643 --> 53:45.887
Let the man rise

53:47.367 --> 53:53.563
to see the glory and the greatness
of his Father.

53:56.834 --> 54:05.079
Let him have so much of power that he
can bear the compassion of God.

54:15.711 --> 54:26.630
Let the Sahasrara develop into such
dimensions that it can execute

54:26.839 --> 54:33.411
the working of the Divine through his own
conscious mind.

54:43.068 --> 54:47.046
The Sahasrara has one mantra, that is
“Nirmala”,

54:47.247 --> 54:52.144
faning: must keep it clean, pure and immaculate.

55:02.604 --> 55:06.614
That is what is your job,

55:08.631 --> 55:14.255
is [to] try to keep it pure and clean.

55:18.534 --> 55:26.848
And this will definitely mark another step,
another accelerated jump

55:27.049 --> 55:35.764
into a new dimension of many more human
beings.

55:49.439 --> 55:53.681
It is a very great pleasure to be in Paris
today,

55:53.882 --> 55:59.594
so that the whole world attention should
be on Paris,

55:59.795 --> 56:07.099
on France, on this country which is really
being cursed;

56:19.537 --> 56:23.329
neglected by all the deities,

56:24.688 --> 56:30.359
because human beings really went very
wrong.

56:35.733 --> 56:43.867
Let all the Deities be settled down in this
country

56:46.670 --> 56:51.010
because this is the attention,

56:54.012 --> 57:02.511
and attention, whatever attention we pay,
is reported to us through Sahasrara.

57:15.019 --> 57:21.589
So the Sahasrara of France may be
opened out,

57:25.511 --> 57:31.964
so the attention of France should be
directed towards Spirit,

57:33.783 --> 57:37.461
and  towards the eternal life.

57:38.517 --> 57:42.888
Is [a] very important country,

57:44.081 --> 57:49.395
that’s why I decided to have this day
celebrated here.

57:52.928 --> 57:59.707
Now the responsibility on the French sahaja
yogis is much greater.

58:04.558 --> 58:08.813
They have to change their methods

58:09.164 --> 58:11.672
and styles.

58:12.270 --> 58:16.375
They should be very mild, gentle

58:17.480 --> 58:20.920
and healthy people

58:23.176 --> 58:28.531
but at the same time they should be very
strong sahaja yogis,

58:30.913 --> 58:34.633
so that when others see them

58:35.992 --> 58:39.542
[they] find that superiority in them.

58:43.416 --> 58:47.830
Before the Sahasrara day we have had
such a successful session.

58:48.031 --> 58:51.023
I am very happy about you.

58:56.707 --> 59:00.096
May God bless you all.

59:01.019 --> 59:05.314
Now I bless all the other centres,

59:06.753 --> 59:10.664
who have prayed and are praying;

59:10.865 --> 59:16.375
to give them a very developed Sahasrara,

59:17.504 --> 59:20.506
an enlightened one,

59:20.692 --> 59:25.704
that will separate them from their small
shells.

59:27.586 --> 59:31.932
Let them expand so much,

59:32.133 --> 59:38.899
that they become one with the whole.

59:39.100 --> 59:42.234
May God bless you all.

59:49.045 --> 59:52.219
May God bless you.

59:52.740 --> 59:55.645
Good (…)
