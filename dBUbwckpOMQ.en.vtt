00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:39.170
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.240
If we are the real seekers of truth,

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.130
we have to be honest about it

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:54.180
and sincere

00:07:55.110 --> 00:07:59.110
so that we are sincere to ourselves,

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.170
and we have justified

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:07.110
our own existence in this world.

00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:11.080
There are so many sadhakas,

00:08:11.200 --> 00:08:14.030
morning till evening they are working out some

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.150
sort of a ritual,

00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:19.170
some sort of a meditation,

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:22.150
some sort of a bhakti,

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:25.180
some sort of reading.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:29.130
But one has to understand, what have we achieved?

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:33.010
Where are we?

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.120
As a Mother I would say,

00:08:36.210 --> 00:08:42.110
"My child, you have done so much in your seeking,

00:08:43.140 --> 00:08:46.010
but what have you found?

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.080
Have you got the ultimate reality?

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:54.030
Have you got what is described in the scriptures?"

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:58.060
For this song which is sung today is in Marathi -

00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:00.070
I wish they had sung something in Sanskrit,

00:09:00.150 --> 00:09:01.230
they are very good at Sanskrit,

00:09:02.060 --> 00:09:04.130
singing also of Adi Shankaracharya and all that.

00:09:04.210 --> 00:09:05.230
Tomorrow they'll do it.

00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:09.130
This song itself was written by Namadeva

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:12.030
in the twelfth century;

00:09:12.230 --> 00:09:17.070
a poet who went later on to Punjab,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:22.100
where Nanak Sahib respected him very much

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:27.100
and asked him that he should write in Punjabi language.

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:30.020
He studied Punjabi language

00:09:30.110 --> 00:09:32.120
and has written such a thick book,

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.100
and in the "Granth Sahib" there are many verses from there.

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:39.060
He was an ordinary tailor,

00:09:40.050 --> 00:09:42.020
very ordinary tailor,

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:46.050
and he went to meet another saint in another village,

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.120
called as Gora Kumbhar.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:51.240
"Kumbhar" means a person who is a potter,  who makes pots;

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:54.160
and Gora Kumbhar was busy

00:09:55.030 --> 00:09:58.000
making the clay ready for his work.

00:09:58.230 --> 00:10:01.150
Namadeva just stood before him

00:10:02.050 --> 00:10:03.120
and he said,

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:08.070
"I came here to see the Nirgun, to the formless,

00:10:08.170 --> 00:10:10.110
to see the chaitanya,

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:14.170
but here it is in Saguna, it is in a form."

00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:17.090
Only a realized soul,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:20.160
only a saint can say this about the saint,

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:23.210
because he knows ultimate reality.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.090
But people who are not realized

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:33.010
cannot understand what is beyond this life.

00:10:35.010 --> 00:10:38.050
Even in Christian religion we have Thomas,

00:10:38.190 --> 00:10:40.140
who came down to India

00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.220
and he wrote a lot of treatise,

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:45.220
were kept in a cave in Egypt,

00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:48.020
which were found out.

00:10:48.090 --> 00:10:50.240
Now there's a book about him,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:54.140
after forty-eight years of research.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.190
It's amazing

00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:01.120
how he is describing Sahaja Yoga throughout,

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.220
that you have to have the experience of reality.

00:11:07.070 --> 00:11:12.240
Of course, every book, every scripture says

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:15.090
"Know thyself" - who am I,

00:11:15.170 --> 00:11:18.160
I must find out what am I.

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:23.100
When it is said so, our effort should be to find out

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:26.030
that Self that is within us.

00:11:26.110 --> 00:11:31.020
We say, "My body, my voice, my nose, my country, my, my" -

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:35.170
who is this "I" to whom all these things belong?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:39.170
From where does this inspiration comes in?

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.070
This "I" is within us,

00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.210
reflected in our heart.

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.210
For you I have to make request that

00:11:47.060 --> 00:11:50.090
you shouldn't accept Me blindly.

00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:53.070
Blindness is not of any help.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.190
But I am offering you a hypothesis as in the science -

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.030
about how this happens and all that.

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:05.100
If it is proved, and if you find

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:11.050
that you have felt as

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:14.020
experienced what I am saying,

00:12:14.020 --> 00:12:17.050
then as honest people you have to accept it.

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:23.110
In the West we have other problems than we have here,

00:12:24.090 --> 00:12:25.210
tremendous problems.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.020
First I went to England,

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:30.140
and you know English how they are, hard nuts -

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.030
difficult to break those nuts.

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:36.200
But once they break

00:12:38.170 --> 00:12:41.080
they are full of scholarship,

00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:44.080
and they are the ones who rushed to

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:48.160
the universities and to different libraries,

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:52.050
and found out everything about Kundalini.

00:12:52.190 --> 00:12:56.090
So much is written already by Nath Panthis who were here,

00:12:57.140 --> 00:13:00.230
who did so much work on the Kundalini awakening,

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.020
but it was lost.

00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.070
And when some Germans came here and other people came here,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.010
they were told by tantrikas some sort of a wrong thing

00:13:10.070 --> 00:13:11.090
which they carried from here.

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:15.050
And such a misunderstanding and such a wrong information

00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.180
to such an extent,

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:19.100
that the German book I read where

00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:21.230
Kundalini lies in your stomach,

00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:24.180
and he has given all explanation.

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:27.080
He was a very learned man no doubt,

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:30.070
but I don't know what he learned is the point,

00:13:30.150 --> 00:13:33.160
and that's how he described about Kundalini.

00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:38.210
This knowledge was known to us since long.

00:13:39.050 --> 00:13:44.100
We had three types of movements towards Divine.

00:13:44.190 --> 00:13:46.010
One was the Vedas.

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:49.070
Even the "vida" means "to know" -

00:13:50.050 --> 00:13:55.130
what Thomas has called the people who know as "gnostics,"

00:13:55.210 --> 00:13:56.230
as "gn."

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:00.000
I don't know in the south what do you say to "gnana"

00:14:00.070 --> 00:14:01.090
or "gyana,"

00:14:01.150 --> 00:14:03.140
but in Marathi we say "gn."

00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:08.080
"Gnostic" word comes from the same thing as person

00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.150
who is knowledgeable; not outward knowledge,

00:14:12.010 --> 00:14:17.040
not by your mental efforts or by emotional feelings,

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.220
but something much beyond.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:24.050
And the same path they tried,

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:28.230
but in the Vedas they have said,

00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.220
in the first,

00:14:31.110 --> 00:14:33.020
first sloka is said that

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:35.180
if you do not know it,

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:38.020
no use reading this book.

00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:40.100
But "knowledge" means what?

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:46.110
- to know it on your central nervous system;

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:51.040
not on your mental

00:14:52.230 --> 00:14:53.200
or physical plane,

00:14:57.190 --> 00:14:59.220
but on a much higher level.

00:15:00.190 --> 00:15:03.200
As we have become human beings,

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:09.090
we have to humbly say that we are not perfect beings.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:14.140
There's something missing us; otherwise why are we fighting,

00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:17.000
why are we quarreling?

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:21.150
I mean, all these problems are mostly human problems:

00:15:21.240 --> 00:15:25.180
ecological problem, economic problem, political problem.

00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:28.210
You come to the source, it's the human being who is

00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:30.150
doing all these things.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:32.210
So what's wrong with human beings?

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:35.220
Animals are all right, they are pashu;

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:38.050
they are under the pasha,

00:15:38.130 --> 00:15:40.080
under the control of God.

00:15:40.190 --> 00:15:42.110
But human beings have got the freedom,

00:15:42.190 --> 00:15:44.050
they are going helter skelter,

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.190
and all these problems are there

00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.090
because they haven't got the real knowledge.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:54.070
So what is the real knowledge that we should seek,

00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.060
and we should go towards it?

00:15:57.230 --> 00:16:00.240
So these people in the Vedas tried to understand,

00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.200
but they more tried to understand the nature

00:16:06.050 --> 00:16:07.240
and the five elements.

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:09.240
While worshipping five elements,

00:16:10.130 --> 00:16:12.220
according to us they moved to the right side,

00:16:13.110 --> 00:16:16.050
and the right-side movement is very well shown in the Greek

00:16:16.170 --> 00:16:17.140
mythology;

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:21.170
and after that from Greece it turned out to be some science,

00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:23.090
and all those things started.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.110
The left side was the bhakti.

00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:32.140
People started worshipping God with blind faith

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:34.170
and going to God,

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.010
worshipping in the temples and churches,

00:16:37.120 --> 00:16:38.130
believing in saints.

00:16:38.240 --> 00:16:41.230
India specially is specially blessed because

00:16:42.100 --> 00:16:44.180
whatever we have is from the saints,

00:16:45.020 --> 00:16:48.160
though it's very deviated and also quite stagnated.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:52.160
But the knowledge came from the saints,

00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.180
from the maharishis,

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.190
and from great seers.

00:16:57.130 --> 00:17:01.190
Another good point about Indians is that their religion

00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:03.230
is not organized,

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:06.110
there's no organization that runs it.

00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.030
It's a very big blessing.

00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:10.150
Despite that,

00:17:11.030 --> 00:17:15.240
all these ideologies in the Vedas also got

00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.230
into some sort of a mental maya (illusion),

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.010
and that's how we have Arya Samaj and all these things

00:17:25.150 --> 00:17:26.150
which are very difficult.

00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.220
I mean, if you meet any Arya Samaji

00:17:29.100 --> 00:17:31.020
you don't know how to deal with that person;

00:17:31.130 --> 00:17:34.020
just goes on talking, talking - God knows,

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.170
such knowledge of his.

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.090
But he has not reached the point,

00:17:40.230 --> 00:17:43.150
and he's satisfied with what he has read,

00:17:44.010 --> 00:17:45.120
reading too much all the time.

00:17:45.230 --> 00:17:47.060
That's what Kabira has said,

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.040
"Padi padi pandita murkh bhayo" -

00:17:50.150 --> 00:17:53.070
"By reading too much, even panditas have become stupid."

00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:55.130
I used to wonder, how can it be?

00:17:55.130 --> 00:17:58.210
But now I meet many of them of that kind.

00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:03.100
So what is the thing is by reading you cannot know

00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:06.160
the ultimate.

00:18:07.090 --> 00:18:09.020
Supposing there's a doctor

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:11.110
and he gives you a medicine for your headache,

00:18:11.210 --> 00:18:13.130
and says take Anacin.

00:18:14.020 --> 00:18:15.140
So you are reading the prescription,

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.210
"Anacin, take Anacin, take Anacin" -

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:19.190
the headache will increase or decrease?

00:18:20.050 --> 00:18:21.220
You have to take the medicine.

00:18:22.190 --> 00:18:24.230
And this is what is written in the Vedas,

00:18:25.060 --> 00:18:27.050
is that you must find out your Self.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:31.060
Same, part of the Vedas are Upanishadas;

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.120
throughout in the Upanishadas nothing but

00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:35.090
"you find out your Self."

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.210
Even "Patanjal shastra" if you see it,

00:18:38.150 --> 00:18:42.120
just in the beginning a wee bit of it is vyayama,

00:18:42.210 --> 00:18:43.070
I mean,

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.180
ashtanga are there.

00:18:45.010 --> 00:18:47.010
A very wee bit of it is

00:18:47.070 --> 00:18:50.190
so-called physical problem that they have dealt.

00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:52.190
In Sahaja Yoga also we use it,

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:56.060
but according to understanding where is the problem is;

00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:01.080
not just like everybody is going into exercises and things,

00:19:01.170 --> 00:19:02.190
getting heart attacks,

00:19:03.010 --> 00:19:04.050
all kinds of problems,

00:19:05.150 --> 00:19:07.050
heat, high blood pressure.

00:19:08.030 --> 00:19:09.110
Sometimes it's low blood pressure,

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:10.200
sometimes high blood pressure,

00:19:11.060 --> 00:19:13.030
and they come and tell Me, "Mother, we are doing yoga,

00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:14.090
and see ..."

00:19:14.170 --> 00:19:16.100
We are not only physical being,

00:19:17.010 --> 00:19:18.180
we are not only mental being,

00:19:19.090 --> 00:19:20.180
neither emotional being,

00:19:21.010 --> 00:19:22.120
but we are spiritual being.

00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.110
And the second type of movement we had in this country

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:28.190
is the bhakti.

00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:30.210
Bhakti is all right,

00:19:31.030 --> 00:19:32.100
going to temple,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:35.230
but that also started deteriorating,

00:19:35.230 --> 00:19:38.120
not to understand what is bhakti is.

00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:41.120
Shri Krishna has said in His "Gita" -

00:19:41.220 --> 00:19:44.090
you must know that Shri Krishna was a diplomat,

00:19:44.170 --> 00:19:45.150
He was not a mother,

00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:47.140
and He knew human beings how they are.

00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:50.240
He wanted them to go round and round to find out the truth,

00:19:51.090 --> 00:19:54.090
because nobody likes a straightforward statement.

00:19:54.180 --> 00:19:58.040
At that time specially He just told it to Arjuna.

00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.130
He said three things for them,

00:20:02.190 --> 00:20:04.020
in which see His diplomacy,

00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:06.000
if you can see through the lines,

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:10.240
is first one He said that you must get to gyana.

00:20:13.230 --> 00:20:15.140
He was not a good salesman

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:18.150
because salesman will never tell you the best thing first,

00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.010
but He said you should take to gyana.

00:20:21.090 --> 00:20:24.060
That is what it is. "Gyana" means this knowledge

00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:26.030
on your central nervous system.

00:20:28.090 --> 00:20:30.030
But the second thing He said,

00:20:30.120 --> 00:20:32.040
that you should do bhakti,

00:20:32.130 --> 00:20:37.190
"Whatever fruit or flower or water you give Me,

00:20:38.020 --> 00:20:38.240
I'll take it,

00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.160
but you must do bhakti which is ananya."

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.180
Now if you know Sanskrit, "ananya" -

00:20:44.020 --> 00:20:45.130
when you are not the other,

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:47.140
when you are a realized soul.

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:50.080
If you are not connected,

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:52.080
what is the bhakti on you?

00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.160
Many people complain,

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:55.160
"Mother, I have been fasting,

00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:56.220
I have been doing this,

00:20:57.050 --> 00:20:59.150
I did this, and see my condition.

00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.200
I have become a nervous wreck."

00:21:02.060 --> 00:21:04.030
It's not the mistake of God;

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.180
you are not yet connected.

00:21:06.010 --> 00:21:07.230
It's a simple thing like a telephone.

00:21:08.070 --> 00:21:10.160
If the telephone is not connected,

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:12.230
what's the use of telephoning?

00:21:13.050 --> 00:21:15.020
You'll spoil the telephone.

00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.150
So bhakti without the connection is wrong,

00:21:18.220 --> 00:21:20.040
that's why Krishna has said it,

00:21:20.110 --> 00:21:23.210
"Yoga kshema vam aham" - "First yoga, then kshema."

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:27.000
First you must achieve your yoga and then

00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.200
your benevolence will come;

00:21:29.050 --> 00:21:31.000
otherwise it won't work out.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.120
Very subtly He has put yoga first.

00:21:34.220 --> 00:21:37.000
Why didn't He say "kshema - yoga"?

00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:43.060
So for bhakti He said like this.

00:21:43.060 --> 00:21:44.230
For karma He said

00:21:45.070 --> 00:21:46.180
that "Do all the work

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.210
and put it at the lotus feet of God Almighty."

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:53.070
That's not possible.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:55.020
Many people say

00:21:55.210 --> 00:22:00.080
that "Mother, all my work I put at the lotus feet of God" -

00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:04.050
even the murders, I think.

00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:06.160
It's just a mental idea

00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.190
that "I am putting it at the lotus feet of God."

00:22:10.030 --> 00:22:11.030
You cannot,

00:22:11.170 --> 00:22:13.140
because you are not at that state.

00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.200
But say, a Sahaja yogi,

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:19.020
he will not tell Me that "I am raising the Kundalini"

00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.070
he'll say, "Mother, it doesn't come up, it's not coming,

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:25.190
it's in the third person he talks.

00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.230
He will say, "This won't go that side" -

00:22:31.090 --> 00:22:32.160
in the third person,

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:34.160
because he is no more there.

00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:38.160
So this is what is the karma,

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.070
automatically is at the lotus feet of God Almighty.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:44.030
Well, He is doing everything.

00:22:44.170 --> 00:22:46.020
We are just instruments.

00:22:46.110 --> 00:22:49.120
Supposing this instrument says that "I am speaking"

00:22:49.220 --> 00:22:51.000
you won't accept.

00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:52.170
In the same way, when we say that

00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:55.170
"I have put my ..." as if they take a load

00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.230
and put it at the lotus feet of God -

00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.010
no. It's automatic,

00:23:00.090 --> 00:23:01.150
it's spontaneous.

00:23:01.150 --> 00:23:02.240
That is sahaja.

00:23:03.210 --> 00:23:06.220
That is born with you.

00:23:07.070 --> 00:23:10.130
All of you have got this power within yourself.

00:23:10.130 --> 00:23:12.090
Now there are books,

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:17.150
which describe Kundalini as a very dangerous thing.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.170
It's absolute nonsense, I tell you.

00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:23.060
I have been to so many nations,

00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.190
so many people have got realization,

00:23:26.030 --> 00:23:28.230
and there is no trace of any trouble to them.

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:32.080
On the contrary, they have improved in every way.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:37.030
Overnight people have given up their drugs,

00:23:38.010 --> 00:23:39.100
their bad habits.

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.030
Overnight people have been cured.

00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.230
It's - I don't do anything as such.

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:47.070
I mean, you may think I am doing something - I don't do,

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.120
your own kundalini works it out.

00:23:50.020 --> 00:23:53.040
It's very surprising how it works,

00:23:53.150 --> 00:23:56.000
and how it helps you;

00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:57.100
because she is your mother,

00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:58.190
your individual mother,

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:01.110
and she knows everything about you.

00:24:01.180 --> 00:24:03.170
It's all taped into her, you can say.

00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.060
Into three-and-a-half coils she is placed -

00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.190
it is because of some mathematical formula -

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.230
and when she rises,

00:24:13.130 --> 00:24:17.060
she might leave a little heat,

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:20.110
because of the little, we can say,

00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:23.220
the struggle that she has to do.

00:24:23.220 --> 00:24:27.020
The heat is little bit sometimes generated in some people.

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:29.020
Supposing you are a liver patient,

00:24:29.090 --> 00:24:32.020
then you might feel a little heat in your hands, that's all.

00:24:33.010 --> 00:24:35.240
But this Kundalini you all have got it,

00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:39.070
and it is the pure desire within you.

00:24:40.100 --> 00:24:42.210
You know in economics it's a law

00:24:43.100 --> 00:24:46.010
that in general, wants are not satiable.

00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.060
We want today a house, tomorrow a car,

00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.010
and then day after tomorrow a helicopter,

00:24:51.080 --> 00:24:53.120
and like that it goes on and on.

00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.100
When we don't have it we struggle for it,

00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:59.010
and when we have it we don't enjoy it.

00:24:59.010 --> 00:25:01.070
But this is a pure desire,

00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:08.060
that is to be one with this all-pervading Power of God's love

00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:11.020
We don't even think that there is such a power,

00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:12.240
we take it for granted.

00:25:13.150 --> 00:25:15.220
We see everything created,

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.190
we see beautiful flowers,

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.050
we see a big tree coming out of a small little seed.

00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.020
Look at our eyes,

00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.140
they are such beautiful cameras -

00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.090
who has made them?

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:33.000
Who has evolved us to this state?

00:25:33.090 --> 00:25:36.170
What is that power that has made us human beings?

00:25:37.010 --> 00:25:39.150
We never want to find out,

00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.240
because science cannot give explanation how:

00:25:43.170 --> 00:25:45.090
how a seed sprouts,

00:25:45.160 --> 00:25:48.120
how we became human beings.

00:25:49.050 --> 00:25:52.040
And so it's all right up to that point,

00:25:52.100 --> 00:25:54.130
beyond that we don't want to know.

00:25:55.240 --> 00:26:00.080
So God Almighty has spread this beautiful chaitanya,

00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:02.030
this Brahmachaitanya all over.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.190
If I am saying so,

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:07.110
you must experience and then tell Me if it is there or not.

00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:09.090
But just to say "no"

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:12.030
means you are denying yourself the chance

00:26:12.110 --> 00:26:15.040
of getting connected to that vital power.

00:26:15.210 --> 00:26:19.070
This vital power has evolved us, no doubt:

00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:21.090
organizes everything,

00:26:21.090 --> 00:26:23.060
creates everything,

00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.230
vibrates everything.

00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:28.120
It coordinates,

00:26:28.190 --> 00:26:29.220
limits,

00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:34.070
also above all it loves you.

00:26:34.190 --> 00:26:38.030
So it thinks how far to go with you.

00:26:38.110 --> 00:26:42.130
Such a beautiful power is all-pervading,

00:26:43.190 --> 00:26:52.070
into every atom and into every living primule,

00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.120
into every living being.

00:26:56.060 --> 00:26:58.120
It acts so beautifully

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:01.180
that we don't even feel the smoothness of it.

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:04.130
We don't even see a flower flowering,

00:27:04.210 --> 00:27:07.050
blossoming, opening, we don't see that.

00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:11.150
It just blossoms and we say, "Oh, today there is a flower."

00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:15.100
It just so sweetly, so beautifully,

00:27:17.020 --> 00:27:21.190
that we do not even feel the existence of it in any way -

00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:23.050
but it exists.

00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:27.110
And unless and until we are connected with that power

00:27:29.010 --> 00:27:33.180
we cannot know the ultimate reality,

00:27:34.030 --> 00:27:38.240
because the spirit within us is not in our attention.

00:27:39.130 --> 00:27:41.210
It's a witness of our attention.

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:44.050
But once this Kundalini rises,

00:27:44.050 --> 00:27:46.100
she passes through the six centers,

00:27:46.180 --> 00:27:49.070
pierces through this fontanel bone area,

00:27:49.150 --> 00:27:52.050
which is the actualization of the baptism,

00:27:52.130 --> 00:27:59.100
and then this spirit comes into our attention as a light.

00:27:59.170 --> 00:28:01.230
And our nerves get a new dimension,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:06.170
new dimension by which we become, we become -

00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.040
again I say we become,

00:28:08.110 --> 00:28:10.170
it's not just lecturing, it's not just bragging,

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:14.060
it's not some sort of a certificate -

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:17.100
you actually become collectively conscious:

00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.080
samuhik chetana.

00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:21.210
You can feel others.

00:28:22.050 --> 00:28:24.080
You can feel on your fingertips,

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.050
on - there are five,

00:28:27.130 --> 00:28:29.020
six and seven centers on the left,

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:31.050
and seven centers on the right.

00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.200
These seven centers represent your emotional side,

00:28:35.120 --> 00:28:38.060
and this, physical and mental side.

00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:41.230
You can feel the centers of all the people.

00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.070
Medically when we treat people,

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:49.010
we treat a tree from outside,

00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.050
we treat the leaves, we can say.

00:28:53.050 --> 00:28:55.190
But if you have really to treat the tree you have to go

00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:56.240
to the roots,

00:28:57.110 --> 00:29:00.220
and I am talking about the roots within us,

00:29:01.110 --> 00:29:03.170
the Tree of Life which is within us.

00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:07.080
You will be amazed that even Mohammed Sahib has described

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.020
Kiyama -

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.240
"Kiyama" means the Resurrection Time.

00:29:12.060 --> 00:29:13.200
"When the Resurrection Time will come,

00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:17.060
your hands will speak and will give witness against you."

00:29:18.110 --> 00:29:20.120
They all have talked about this time,

00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:22.100
the Last Judgment,

00:29:23.010 --> 00:29:26.100
and this Kali Yuga is going to bring forth Satya Yuga.

00:29:26.210 --> 00:29:29.160
But how many are willing to take to it is the point.

00:29:30.130 --> 00:29:33.050
Thousands and thousands will go off to some sort of

00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:35.210
a madding, maddening place,

00:29:36.050 --> 00:29:37.180
but not after reality.

00:29:38.020 --> 00:29:41.050
You require a kind of a divine intelligence,

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.020
I think, to understand that.

00:29:43.130 --> 00:29:44.090
You'll be amazed,

00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.170
I found Russia the most receptive country for this,

00:29:49.030 --> 00:29:51.090
because they are not so materialistic.

00:29:51.170 --> 00:29:54.110
They haven't got this kind of freedom or anything,

00:29:54.200 --> 00:29:56.180
but they have freedom to go inside.

00:29:57.010 --> 00:29:59.010
Very introspective people, even their writers,

00:29:59.090 --> 00:30:00.070
I always read them,

00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:01.180
Tolstoy and all these.

00:30:02.090 --> 00:30:04.090
They all are very introspective,

00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:08.130
and they are - you will be amazed that we had to

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.240
always arrange a big stadium,

00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:13.130
and still there were so many people sitting outside.

00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:18.160
At least in one place called as Togliatti there are

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.240
22,000 Sahaja yogis.

00:30:22.140 --> 00:30:25.040
And when I was there this coup had taken place,

00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:27.020
so I said, "Aren't you disturbed?"

00:30:27.090 --> 00:30:28.190
So he said, "Mother, what is to be disturbed?

00:30:29.010 --> 00:30:30.040
We are in the kingdom of God,

00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:32.160
we don't belong to this kingdom."

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:36.070
Such nice things are happening all over the world.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:38.140
We Indians have some other problems,

00:30:38.210 --> 00:30:40.050
we are very conditioned.

00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:44.110
We have such ideals before us,

00:30:44.230 --> 00:30:46.140
but we never aspire.

00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:48.080
We will worship Rama,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.200
we'll worship a guru,

00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:53.150
but what have you got within yourself?

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:56.150
You're clinging onto something;

00:30:56.230 --> 00:30:59.120
what about you having something?

00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:02.180
That is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:03.010 --> 00:31:04.160
Unless and until you know yourself,

00:31:04.230 --> 00:31:06.240
you will not know Shri Ram,

00:31:07.050 --> 00:31:09.010
you'll not know anyone.

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.180
The other day I saw one book on Sahaja Yoga some

00:31:12.010 --> 00:31:13.130
crazy man has written.

00:31:13.190 --> 00:31:15.070
He's denying the existence of Krishna,

00:31:15.140 --> 00:31:17.110
he's denying the existence of Rama,

00:31:17.170 --> 00:31:20.080
denying the existence of Jesus, everybody.

00:31:21.030 --> 00:31:23.000
I said, such a crazy man,

00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:24.230
it's very unscientific;

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.140
without finding out,

00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.030
how can you say it?

00:31:30.120 --> 00:31:32.120
you just say like that without finding it out.

00:31:32.120 --> 00:31:33.110
Supposing I never come to Madras

00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:34.210
and start describing Madras.

00:31:35.100 --> 00:31:36.220
What you will call Me?

00:31:37.140 --> 00:31:40.100
In the same way many people have written about God,

00:31:40.170 --> 00:31:42.240
because there is no law prohibiting them to write,

00:31:43.060 --> 00:31:44.150
any nonsense can be written.

00:31:45.230 --> 00:31:48.190
But unless and until we get the truth,

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:51.180
we will not know who is a fake guru and who is not.

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.210
Like you may ask Me: "Mother, is he a fake guru,

00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:55.070
is he a fake guru?"

00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:57.190
I would say, why do you believe in Me?

00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.100
Supposing I say he is not, so

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.230
you will start quarreling with Me.

00:32:01.050 --> 00:32:03.030
If I say he is, then you will believe Me.

00:32:03.090 --> 00:32:06.010
That's the kind of a thing is not necessary.

00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:07.230
You'll know yourself,

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:11.000
and through that you will know the absolute truth,

00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:14.230
because your spirit is absolute.

00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.170
It gives absolute truth.

00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:19.210
Tomorrow I'll tell you more about spirit,

00:32:20.060 --> 00:32:23.020
I think for today this is sufficient.

00:32:23.090 --> 00:32:25.040
We should have.

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:31.160
I think if you like,

00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:34.240
we can have the session for Self-realization.

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:36.080
It takes no time.

00:32:36.170 --> 00:32:39.080
First you should be ready and just ask for it,

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.170
and you'll all get it.

00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:45.000
Of course you must be having questions in your heads.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:46.230
Last time when I came to Madras

00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.030
the whole time was spent in answering questions,

00:32:49.090 --> 00:32:51.100
questions, questions, questions.

00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:55.060
But now I would request you that if you have any questions,

00:32:55.130 --> 00:32:57.240
keep them aside, and you can write them.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:00.210
Tomorrow I'll answer all your questions,

00:33:00.210 --> 00:33:02.080
but just now please,

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:06.000
if possible, try to get your realization.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.100
Thank you very much.

00:34:46.070 --> 00:34:48.010
I would say if you want to go out for five minutes

00:34:48.090 --> 00:34:49.180
you can all go and come back,

00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.210
it's all right - but don't talk, that's all.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:35.000
I didn't tell you about

00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:40.170
the third kind of movement we had in our country,

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:44.000
is of Nath Panthis.

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:46.240
Jains have Adi Nath,

00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:53.170
and a deviation started from that.

00:35:56.190 --> 00:36:01.170
One guru was supposed to give knowledge to only one person -

00:36:03.210 --> 00:36:06.090
like Janaka had only Nachiketa -

00:36:09.130 --> 00:36:11.180
till the time of Gyaneshwara,

00:36:12.070 --> 00:36:15.190
that's in the twelfth century.

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:22.160
Gyaneshwara

00:36:26.100 --> 00:36:32.110
was the disciple of his own brother Nivritinath,

00:36:32.110 --> 00:36:34.090
and they suffered a lot.

00:36:36.010 --> 00:36:39.220
And he asked Nivritinath for one permission,

00:36:40.090 --> 00:36:43.240
that "Let me open the truth to the public.

00:36:44.100 --> 00:36:46.040
Just I'll tell about it,

00:36:46.100 --> 00:36:47.070
I'll not do anything,

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.210
I'll just tell about it."

00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:53.120
Because,

00:36:53.230 --> 00:36:55.030
thirteen, fourteen thousand years back

00:36:55.100 --> 00:36:58.090
Markandeya has described about Kundalini.

00:36:58.090 --> 00:37:02.160
Then came Adi Shankaracharya has described about Kundalini,

00:37:03.070 --> 00:37:05.080
but all in Sanskrit language.

00:37:05.160 --> 00:37:08.110
And Sanskrit self-knowledge was not available

00:37:09.030 --> 00:37:10.230
to the common public,

00:37:11.060 --> 00:37:14.120
and those who knew Sanskrit language

00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:20.080
didn't want to get into self-knowledge.

00:37:21.070 --> 00:37:27.160
Thus this knowledge was kept a secret all the time.

00:37:28.130 --> 00:37:32.100
But he asked, and then he wrote "Gyaneshwari."

00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:42.020
"Gyaneshwari" is nothing but a kind of a Marathi "Gita"

00:37:42.170 --> 00:37:47.110
which he enlarged and decorated with lots of poetry.

00:37:48.190 --> 00:37:52.090
Sixth chapter in "Gyaneshwari" he described about Kundalini

00:37:52.200 --> 00:37:54.000
very clearly.

00:37:55.170 --> 00:38:02.030
And that sixth chapter has been also mutilated,

00:38:02.130 --> 00:38:05.060
but was called as "nishiddha",

00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:09.070
is not to be read

00:38:09.070 --> 00:38:12.030
by the people in charge of religion,

00:38:12.110 --> 00:38:13.220
in charge of

00:38:18.080 --> 00:38:20.200
our ascent, so-called.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:22.240
And they said, "You are not to read this,

00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.220
otherwise you will be in trouble."

00:38:25.050 --> 00:38:28.110
Thus this chapter was closed and nobody

00:38:29.030 --> 00:38:31.030
tried to know about it,

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:34.030
but the Nath Panthis then grew up.

00:38:35.070 --> 00:38:37.120
Out of that we have Kabira,

00:38:38.090 --> 00:38:39.200
we have Nanaka.

00:38:43.150 --> 00:38:45.020
He talked of "khalis",

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:48.070
Nanaka talked of khalis.

00:38:48.210 --> 00:38:51.050
"Khalis" means pure, nirmal.

00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:53.160
Sahaja yogis are nirmal.

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:02.130
If somebody misuses anything,

00:39:04.130 --> 00:39:06.110
it is shown clearly;

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:09.120
and a saint cannot be like this.

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:12.140
Khalis people cannot be like this,

00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:15.090
cannot have violence.

00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.170
It's love.

00:39:19.030 --> 00:39:22.020
It's love which is absolutely nirvaj,

00:39:22.150 --> 00:39:24.230
without any compensation.

00:39:25.090 --> 00:39:28.010
It's love that's unlimited.

00:39:28.130 --> 00:39:30.150
It's love which does not,

00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.130
has any discrimination.

00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:37.100
Like the energy in the plant rises

00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.190
or we can say the sap rises,

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:43.200
goes to various areas:

00:39:44.220 --> 00:39:48.010
as well as to the leaves, to the branches,

00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:53.070
to the flowers, to the fruits,

00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:55.100
and comes back.

00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.180
It does not stick to one.

00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:02.010
If you stick to one,

00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:10.000
that is the death of that area

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.070
as well as the death of that tree.

00:40:14.070 --> 00:40:19.050
So we have to understand that all these great incarnations,

00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.050
seers and prophets,

00:40:21.190 --> 00:40:25.050
all of them came on this earth on the same Tree of Life.

00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:27.230
You have to believe in all of them.

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.060
If you start believing in them,

00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:31.040
all of them,

00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.140
then where will be the quarrel?

00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:36.080
But those who believe only in one must quarrel,

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:39.000
and that's why they don't like us,

00:40:39.110 --> 00:40:43.230
because we believe in all - not just a belief,

00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:46.190
but it's the truth.

00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:57.030
Now here I have to tell you that it's a living process

00:40:57.100 --> 00:41:00.100
of evolution, the last breakthrough.

00:41:01.130 --> 00:41:04.180
You didn't do anything to become human beings;

00:41:05.050 --> 00:41:07.110
in the same way it is effortless,

00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:09.040
it is sahaj.

00:41:09.150 --> 00:41:14.050
Only thing I will tell you how to nourish your centers,

00:41:14.170 --> 00:41:17.190
so that it is easier for Kundalini to rise.

00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:20.140
It's very simple, all of you should do it.

00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:24.200
Here now, you don't have to look at others,

00:41:25.050 --> 00:41:26.220
but look at yourself.

00:41:27.120 --> 00:41:29.000
You have to take out your shoes,

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.210
would be a good idea because - to feel the Mother Earth,

00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:34.120
because she is the one who sucks in our problems

00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:35.180
all the time,

00:41:40.130 --> 00:41:43.080
specially this Yoga Bhoomi of ours.

00:41:43.230 --> 00:41:47.040
We do not know how great we are to be born in this country.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:50.110
They have made a mess out of it, doesn't matter.

00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:53.020
If Ram Raja has to come it will come here,

00:41:53.170 --> 00:41:57.020
not a political style but a spiritual style.

00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:07.230
I think that's going down all the time.

00:42:08.120 --> 00:42:11.100
You could push it in a little - it is going down.

00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:16.090
It's all right now, I think, it's going to stay.

00:42:17.090 --> 00:42:20.210
Now it's better. Thank you.

00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:28.020
As I told you, you don't have to do anything.

00:42:28.110 --> 00:42:31.190
You don't have to stop your thoughts,

00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:36.110
you don't have to put any effort,

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:39.170
not to say any mantras, nothing.

00:42:40.050 --> 00:42:42.030
Kundalini will do the job;

00:42:42.120 --> 00:42:45.170
she knows you very well and she'll manage it.

00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:47.180
Just have faith in yourself,

00:42:48.010 --> 00:42:52.150
all confidence that you will get realization.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:57.100
To feel guilty is something not natural,

00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.020
is something I think has come through people telling us

00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:04.070
that "You are sinners, you are this, you are that."

00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.210
In My eyes nobody is a sinner.

00:43:08.050 --> 00:43:12.080
You are lost, you are ignorant, but nobody is a sinner.

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:16.220
So we have to understand

00:43:17.060 --> 00:43:20.050
that we have to have respect for ourselves,

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:22.120
because we are glorious,

00:43:23.220 --> 00:43:25.070
we are fantastic.

00:43:26.010 --> 00:43:30.070
Because we are not connected we look like that,

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:33.040
we despise ourselves, others may despise you.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:35.110
But you are a human being,

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:40.200
you are the epitome of evolution.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.130
And now a little breakthrough is needed,

00:43:43.190 --> 00:43:45.220
just like a connection,

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:49.080
and I am sure you will know your Self.

00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.170
After getting your awakening of the Kundalini

00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:58.230
and piercing through your fontanel bone area,

00:43:59.110 --> 00:44:01.180
you'll start feeling cool breeze in your hands.

00:44:02.230 --> 00:44:04.140
This is chaitanya.

00:44:04.230 --> 00:44:06.180
In the Bible is described as the cool breeze of

00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.030
the Holy Ghost,

00:44:08.120 --> 00:44:10.100
in the Koran is called as "Ruh".

00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:15.190
After that you will also start feeling the cool breeze

00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:17.130
coming out of your head.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.230
Once the cool breeze starts coming out of your head,

00:44:26.010 --> 00:44:28.060
then you'll feel very relaxed,

00:44:28.150 --> 00:44:31.120
peaceful and joyous.

00:44:32.010 --> 00:44:34.020
So many people start just laughing after that.

00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.190
You should laugh.

00:44:37.130 --> 00:44:39.210
This world is made for your enjoyment

00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.240
and now you have to enter into the kingdom of God,

00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:47.160
which is not only joy,

00:44:48.050 --> 00:44:50.000
not only peace,

00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:53.190
but it's blissful state.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:05.130
I think if you are wearing anything tight or near the neck,

00:45:05.190 --> 00:45:07.220
you'd better release a little bit if it is making you

00:45:08.050 --> 00:45:09.050
uncomfortable.

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:12.000
Also if you can take out the spectacles...

00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:14.110
later on when I tell you, not now;

00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:18.000
because you are closing your eyes,

00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:21.070
and then you don't open your eyes.

00:45:21.170 --> 00:45:25.240
So first we'll show you how you are going to help yourself,

00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.040
to begin with.

00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:29.060
By this you will know your centers also.

00:45:29.130 --> 00:45:31.240
On the left-hand side we'll be working.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:37.080
First of all,

00:45:37.150 --> 00:45:40.130
you'll have to put the left hand towards Me like this -

00:45:40.220 --> 00:45:42.110
on your lap, comfortably.

00:45:42.190 --> 00:45:44.080
Imagine, you don't have to go to Himalayas,

00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:45.170
do anything of the kind,

00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.130
just comfortably on your chair you should get

00:45:48.190 --> 00:45:50.220
your realization - that's your right.

00:45:51.060 --> 00:45:53.010
Put your left hand just like that.

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.200
Now with the right hand we have to nourish

00:46:03.030 --> 00:46:04.210
our centers on the left-hand side.

00:46:05.100 --> 00:46:08.130
First we put our hand on our heart,

00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.100
because here is the spirit reflected.

00:46:11.190 --> 00:46:14.070
It's the reflection of God Almighty,

00:46:15.150 --> 00:46:18.220
is the spirit.

00:46:22.030 --> 00:46:26.170
Then we go down onto the upper portion of our abdomen

00:46:27.050 --> 00:46:29.000
on the left-hand side.

00:46:29.170 --> 00:46:32.190
This is the center of our mastery.

00:46:33.080 --> 00:46:35.170
If you are the spirit you become your own master,

00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.110
you don't need any master,

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:39.110
your spirit guides you.

00:46:41.140 --> 00:46:45.150
Then you go down into the lower portion of your abdomen

00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:48.240
on the left-hand side.

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:55.070
This is how you know the knowledge

00:46:56.040 --> 00:46:58.050
on your central nervous system.

00:46:59.140 --> 00:47:02.110
This center is the one which gives you

00:47:03.020 --> 00:47:04.220
pure knowledge - Shuddha Vidya,

00:47:05.050 --> 00:47:08.230
which works on your central nervous system.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:13.030
Then you raise your hand again on top,

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:17.090
on the left-hand side of your abdomen and push it,

00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.120
which is the center for Guru Principle.

00:47:21.230 --> 00:47:24.120
Supposing you have been to some wrong guru or anything,

00:47:24.210 --> 00:47:27.160
it can correct it.

00:47:29.160 --> 00:47:34.010
Then you have to put your right hand on your heart.

00:47:38.180 --> 00:47:41.210
Again now you put your hand in the corner of your neck

00:47:42.130 --> 00:47:43.240
and your shoulder,

00:47:44.140 --> 00:47:46.230
and you have to turn your head to your right.

00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.110
This is the center which catches when you feel guilty,

00:47:53.030 --> 00:47:56.000
and when you feel guilty this center is catching.

00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:59.100
It gives you many diseases - one of them is angina,

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:02.070
and also spondylitis;

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.120
and so many things happen to the organs because

00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:07.020
they become lethargic.

00:48:07.150 --> 00:48:10.210
So best thing is to put your hand here properly and

00:48:10.210 --> 00:48:14.070
push your head to your right like this.

00:48:15.030 --> 00:48:19.110
Then please take your right hand on top of your forehead

00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:23.190
and bend your head as far as possible.

00:48:25.140 --> 00:48:28.200
This is the center where you have to forgive,

00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:35.030
forgive everyone without thinking whom you have to forgive.

00:48:36.170 --> 00:48:39.100
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything,

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.020
it's our idea.

00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:45.130
But if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands.

00:48:45.240 --> 00:48:48.130
So please put your hand like this,

00:48:48.210 --> 00:48:50.160
this is the center for forgiveness;

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.020
without thinking about people whom you have to forgive,

00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:54.240
or those who have harmed you.

00:48:56.090 --> 00:48:59.230
This is a very important Agnya Chakra because

00:49:00.090 --> 00:49:02.030
this is very constricted one,

00:49:02.150 --> 00:49:04.120
and if you don't forgive it won't rise,

00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.020
Kundalini cannot get through.

00:49:06.090 --> 00:49:08.070
Just forgive.

00:49:08.180 --> 00:49:11.240
Now push back the right hand on the back side of your head.

00:49:11.240 --> 00:49:12.230
This we'll be doing later on,

00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:14.210
I'm just showing you the chakras.

00:49:15.050 --> 00:49:17.030
Now this back side here,

00:49:17.110 --> 00:49:19.100
because you feel guilty all the time,

00:49:19.170 --> 00:49:21.240
you think you have done wrong or anything,

00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:24.200
so best thing is just to ask forgiveness from

00:49:25.030 --> 00:49:28.190
the divine Power, this center is here.

00:49:31.050 --> 00:49:34.130
Now, stretch your hand fully

00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.100
and put the center of your palm

00:49:37.190 --> 00:49:39.190
on top of the fontanel bone area,

00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.130
which was a soft bone in your childhood,

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:45.020
the taloo, here - just there.

00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:46.230
Push back your fingers nicely,

00:49:46.230 --> 00:49:50.180
push back so there's a good pressure on your scalp,

00:49:51.130 --> 00:49:53.020
good pressure on your scalp.

00:49:53.020 --> 00:49:57.000
Now please bend your head as far as possible.

00:49:58.050 --> 00:50:02.100
And now you have to move your scalp slowly,

00:50:02.170 --> 00:50:05.130
seven times clockwise -

00:50:10.120 --> 00:50:11.230
clockwise.

00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:15.170
With a pressure: move your hands backwards,

00:50:15.230 --> 00:50:19.100
otherwise - I mean your fingers -

00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.070
otherwise it won't have a pressure.

00:50:28.240 --> 00:50:31.040
Now, done!

00:50:37.170 --> 00:50:39.000
Now,

00:50:40.060 --> 00:50:43.090
so first of all we must have self-confidence

00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:51.010
in ourselves, must have respect,

00:50:55.230 --> 00:51:00.090
and love for ourselves.

00:51:03.150 --> 00:51:07.120
So now, we put our left hand like this,

00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:11.070
put both the feet apart from each other,

00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:17.070
and now close our eyes.

00:51:19.060 --> 00:51:22.060
Put the right hand on your heart, please,

00:51:22.140 --> 00:51:25.080
put the right hand on your heart.

00:51:30.040 --> 00:51:31.040
Here

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:40.190
is the center of the spirit, here resides the spirit.

00:51:40.190 --> 00:51:44.050
You can ask Me a question three times as you would ask

00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:47.080
a computer, in your heart.

00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:50.190
You can call Me "Shri Mataji" or "Mother,"

00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:52.140
whichever way you like.

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:59.190
"Mother, am I the spirit?"

00:52:01.020 --> 00:52:05.010
Ask three times, "Mother, am I the spirit?

00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:09.010
Shri Mataji, am I the spirit?"

00:52:27.070 --> 00:52:30.130
If you are the spirit,

00:52:31.050 --> 00:52:34.240
you become your master.

00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:40.190
So now please take your hand on the left-hand side

00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:45.060
in the upper portion of your abdomen, and press it hard.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:48.010
Now ask here a question again,

00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.150
"Mother, am I my own master?"

00:52:53.230 --> 00:52:56.070
Ask three times, please, in your heart,

00:52:56.170 --> 00:52:59.020
with full confidence, "Mother, am I my own master?"

00:52:59.120 --> 00:53:02.040
You are, but you just ask Me the question.

00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:21.170
I respect your freedom,

00:53:22.010 --> 00:53:25.140
and I cannot force on you pure knowledge,

00:53:25.230 --> 00:53:27.230
you have to ask for it.

00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:31.170
So now you have to put your right hand

00:53:32.010 --> 00:53:35.090
in the lower portion of your abdomen, press it hard,

00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:38.230
on the left-hand side.

00:53:41.220 --> 00:53:43.150
Now here you have to say,

00:53:44.020 --> 00:53:50.220
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge - Shuddha Vidya."

00:53:52.060 --> 00:53:55.190
"Shri Mataji, give me Shuddha Vidya."

00:53:56.030 --> 00:53:57.110
Please say it six times,

00:53:57.190 --> 00:54:02.170
because this center has got six petals, Swadisthan center.

00:54:03.060 --> 00:54:07.210
"Please give me Shuddha Vidya - pure knowledge."

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:21.210
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge,

00:54:23.130 --> 00:54:26.100
the Kundalini starts rising.

00:54:28.110 --> 00:54:32.110
But you have to facilitate its movement

00:54:32.220 --> 00:54:38.120
by opening your higher chakras with your self-confidence.

00:54:39.110 --> 00:54:43.030
So please now raise your right hand

00:54:43.110 --> 00:54:46.120
in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard,

00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.070
on the left-hand side.

00:54:48.170 --> 00:54:51.020
Keep your feet apart.

00:54:53.200 --> 00:54:55.010
Here,

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:03.120
you have to say ten times,

00:55:04.060 --> 00:55:06.160
with full confidence in yourself:

00:55:07.020 --> 00:55:12.010
"Mother, I am my own master." Say that, please,

00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:15.190
"Mother, I am my own master."

00:55:16.020 --> 00:55:18.050
"Mother, I am my own guru."

00:55:18.160 --> 00:55:20.070
Because all the great gurus, satgurus,

00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:27.030
have created this center for your ascent.

00:55:32.190 --> 00:55:35.180
And Mother always wants Her children,

00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.010
not only what She has,

00:55:39.190 --> 00:55:45.060
but to have much more than Her.

00:55:50.090 --> 00:55:51.190
Now,

00:55:56.120 --> 00:56:00.000
at the very outset I have to tell you

00:56:00.070 --> 00:56:03.120
that you are not this body, not this mind,

00:56:04.010 --> 00:56:06.030
not these emotions,

00:56:06.180 --> 00:56:09.100
nor these conditionings and ego,

00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:13.040
but you are pure spirit.

00:56:16.070 --> 00:56:20.100
So now raise your right hand onto your heart,

00:56:21.040 --> 00:56:24.160
and say with full confidence twelve times,

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:29.090
"Mother, I am the pure spirit."

00:56:34.030 --> 00:56:39.170
Mother, I am the pure spirit" - twelve times -

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:46.090
"Shri Mataji, I am the Shuddha Atma."

00:56:47.230 --> 00:56:51.020
With full confidence you have to say.

00:56:58.040 --> 00:57:04.190
I have to tell you that this divine all-pervading Power

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.190
is the ocean of knowledge,

00:57:10.230 --> 00:57:16.010
is the ocean of compassion and bliss.

00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:19.140
You have to say with full confidence,

00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:24.230
"Mother, I am not guilty at all" -

00:57:25.210 --> 00:57:28.210
sixteen times, please say it.

00:57:31.070 --> 00:57:35.150
You have to say, "Shri Mataji, I am Nirdosha,

00:57:35.150 --> 00:57:40.240
I am Nirdosha." Please say it sixteen times.

00:57:44.240 --> 00:57:48.130
Say it for My satisfaction.

00:58:02.070 --> 00:58:11.020
Now raise your right hand on top of your forehead.

00:58:14.010 --> 00:58:17.070
As it is, I have already told you

00:58:17.140 --> 00:58:21.050
whether you forgive or don't forgive,

00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:24.100
you don't do anything.

00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:29.200
So now bend your head as far as possible,

00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:36.040
and here, with all humility, forgive everyone!

00:58:36.140 --> 00:58:38.070
Just forgive!

00:58:38.140 --> 00:58:41.100
Don't think of people who have troubled you

00:58:41.170 --> 00:58:44.200
and tortured you, but just forgive them.

00:58:46.090 --> 00:58:50.080
That's the best way you can get rid of the burden,

00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:53.130
because you are playing into wrong hands

00:58:53.190 --> 00:58:55.080
if you don't forgive.

00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:56.220
Now say it from your heart,

00:58:57.040 --> 00:59:01.030
not how many times but from your heart, please say.

00:59:01.110 --> 00:59:04.050
Many people say that it's very difficult to forgive.

00:59:04.130 --> 00:59:06.050
What is there that's difficult? -

00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:08.140
it's just to say it.

00:59:16.200 --> 00:59:21.090
Now take back your right hand to the back side of your head,

00:59:21.150 --> 00:59:24.230
and push back your head as far as possible,

00:59:25.070 --> 00:59:28.050
push back, as far as possible.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:32.100
Here again you have to say from your heart,

00:59:32.160 --> 00:59:37.130
"Oh divine Power, if I have done anything wrong,

00:59:37.210 --> 00:59:39.170
please forgive me.

00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:42.240
If I have done anything wrong unknowingly,

00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.190
please forgive me."

00:59:46.050 --> 00:59:49.060
That also say it from your heart.

01:00:01.180 --> 01:00:03.010
Now stretch your hand fully

01:00:08.220 --> 01:00:12.190
and put the center of your palm on top of

01:00:13.020 --> 01:00:16.220
the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone

01:00:17.030 --> 01:00:19.080
in your childhood.

01:00:19.190 --> 01:00:23.160
It is called as taloo, talavyam in Sanskrit.

01:00:24.230 --> 01:00:29.030
Now, put down your head as far as possible,

01:00:29.170 --> 01:00:30.220
put down.

01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.230
And now, please try to move your scalp

01:00:39.070 --> 01:00:44.010
with a pressure by pushing your fingers outward.

01:00:44.150 --> 01:00:46.080
Please push your fingers outward,

01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:48.040
put a nice pressure,

01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:53.020
and move it seven times clockwise.

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:59.000
Here again, I cannot force Self-realization on you,

01:00:59.080 --> 01:01:00.190
you have to ask for it.

01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:02.190
So while moving your hand,

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:04.030
say it seven times,

01:01:04.090 --> 01:01:08.220
"Mother, please give me my Self-realization.

01:01:09.030 --> 01:01:12.000
Mother, please give me my Self-realization."

01:01:12.060 --> 01:01:14.240
I cannot force it on anyone.

01:02:28.210 --> 01:02:31.040
Please take down your hands.

01:02:31.120 --> 01:02:34.030
Open your eyes very slowly.

01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:36.130
Now,

01:02:40.210 --> 01:02:45.150
put your right hand towards Me like this,

01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:47.080
and bend your head

01:02:47.140 --> 01:02:50.190
and see for yourself if there's a cool breeze

01:02:50.190 --> 01:02:53.050
coming out of your head.

01:02:58.120 --> 01:02:59.230
See at the fontanel bone.

01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.140
Some people get it very close but not on top,

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:05.000
little away,

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.000
or some people get it like a jet,

01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.150
quite far away.

01:03:08.230 --> 01:03:12.020
It may be hot also possibly, it could be hot also.

01:03:12.130 --> 01:03:16.120
If you have not forgiven, it will be definitely hot.

01:03:17.190 --> 01:03:21.180
Now, please put your left hand towards Me.

01:03:23.020 --> 01:03:27.130
Now, again bend your head and see for yourself

01:03:27.190 --> 01:03:30.210
if there is a cool breeze or a hot breeze coming

01:03:31.030 --> 01:03:32.080
out of your own head.

01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:34.160
You have to certify yourself,

01:03:34.160 --> 01:03:37.200
is Sahaja Yoga is becoming something;

01:03:38.010 --> 01:03:40.150
as I told you there's no certificate.

01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.200
Maybe some people are having hot breeze, doesn't matter.

01:03:51.090 --> 01:03:56.010
Now, again please put your right hand towards Me,

01:03:56.100 --> 01:04:01.100
and bend your head and see for yourself again.

01:04:10.190 --> 01:04:14.140
Now, just not to put it on top of your head,

01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:17.140
little away, then you will feel it, little away.

01:04:17.200 --> 01:04:21.090
Now please put your hands like this towards Me,

01:04:21.220 --> 01:04:25.210
watch Me and don't think. You can do it.

01:04:33.150 --> 01:04:40.210
All those who have felt cool breeze on their fingertips,

01:04:40.210 --> 01:04:43.070
or hot breeze even,

01:04:44.070 --> 01:04:50.020
and those who have felt either on the hands or out of

01:04:50.140 --> 01:04:56.030
the fontanel bone area, or in both the areas,

01:04:56.190 --> 01:05:00.060
please raise both your hands.

01:05:00.140 --> 01:05:02.150
Please raise both your hands.

01:05:11.180 --> 01:05:16.100
Oh, my! May God bless you.

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.080
Most of you have got it.

01:05:19.160 --> 01:05:22.050
Most of you have got it.

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:25.050
Now don't discuss about it,

01:05:25.140 --> 01:05:29.030
because if you come to the mental level you'll lose it.

01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:31.140
Just enjoy it.

01:05:31.230 --> 01:05:37.170
I would like you tonight to sleep in peace.

01:05:38.150 --> 01:05:42.040
Tomorrow again you telephone to your friends and people;

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:44.120
because you can't pay for it

01:05:44.200 --> 01:05:46.060
and there is nothing to be done,

01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:50.160
it's your own - like the Mother Earth doesn't know

01:05:50.230 --> 01:05:54.160
how to charge the seeds for sprouting them.

01:05:55.020 --> 01:05:58.180
So this is what is your purva punya also.

01:05:59.050 --> 01:06:02.020
Those who haven't got it will get it tomorrow.

01:06:02.220 --> 01:06:05.020
So please all of you should come,

01:06:05.100 --> 01:06:07.160
and please call your friends.

01:06:07.230 --> 01:06:11.060
This is the best thing that you can give to anyone.

01:06:11.140 --> 01:06:13.140
This is what we were waiting for.

01:06:13.230 --> 01:06:14.200
May God bless you.

01:06:24.070 --> 01:06:25.120
Please come tomorrow.

01:06:25.200 --> 01:06:29.120
I'll explain to you about the nature of spirit,

01:06:29.180 --> 01:06:31.020
what is spirit.

01:06:56.170 --> 01:06:58.100
See what I have done just now.

01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:05.040
He wants you all to come and take darshan.

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:08.090
Now I am sitting before you, it's the darshan.

01:07:09.190 --> 01:07:13.010
There is no need to touch My feet, no need.

01:07:17.100 --> 01:07:21.170
Tomorrow we'll see. You are so much wanting to do it,

01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.160
there is no need to do it. There are politicians for that.

01:07:29.150 --> 01:07:31.110
Tomorrow please bring your questions.

01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.040
Please bring your questions,

01:07:33.110 --> 01:07:35.090
I'll be happy to answer.
