00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:13.150
I am so happy and joyous

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.590
to be here with so many Sahaja Yogis,

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:21.830
and so many of them are very new...

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.630
not very new to Me,

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.070
perhaps I have known all of you,

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:31.870
thousands of years back.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.990
You are sitting in the sun.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:54.790
In Sahaja Yoga you all have to understand one simple thing —

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.510
that you are the spirit.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.110
And whatever is not the spirit

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:13.310
is not yourself.

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.390
We can compare spirit with the sun.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.470
The sun can be covered with the clouds,

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:38.430
there could be superimpositions on the sun,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.110
but sun remains as it is, at this point.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.070
You cannot enlighten the sun.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:58.470
It is illumined by itself.

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:04.870
Now, when the clouds are removed,

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.510
the superimpositions are removed,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.070
the sun shines through the atmosphere.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.110
So, our spirit is also

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:35.630
is superimposed by ignorance.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.190
As long as there is superimposition,

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.390
you can't see the spirit.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.510
And even when few clouds disappear

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.470
the superimposition exists.

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.910
One has to have a clear sky

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.670
to see the light of the spirit shining through.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.870
There are many ways by which we can try to remove the clouds.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.550
The first and the foremost thing is the assumption, the faith

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:49.990
that you are the spirit

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.590
and that the rest is superimposition.

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:08.230
You have to assume that within yourself —

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:15.910
after Realization it should become very easy —

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.910
that you are something much more,

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.830
something very different

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.430
from what you have known so far.

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:45.150
So, now the new situation arises —

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:54.910
that you do not have a blind faith,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:05.110
but you have a faith that has come out of an experience.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.350
So your intellect should not fight it.

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:19.710
It should not try to challenge you.

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:27.750
If it challenges and if you hear to your intellect,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.950
you'll again go down.

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:46.350
Even if you get the glimpse of a star in the sky,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:58.430
then the scientist believe that there is a star.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.430
So, in the same manner,

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:11.510
even if you get the glimpse of your Realization,

00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:23.750
you have to at least believe that you are also a spirit.

00:07:27.750 --> 00:07:34.390
You go on sticking on to that experience

00:07:36.670 --> 00:07:40.550
and keeping your attention on the fact

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.350
that you are the spirit.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.230
Tell your intellect not to cheat you anymore.

00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:07.230
You can turn the face of your intellect by this.

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.910
Now your intellect will start working

00:08:14.110 --> 00:08:19.150
for the pursuit of the spirit.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.910
This is what faith means.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:32.470
Faith means rise to pure intelligence.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:47.870
Now, when you are seeing clouds removed to a great extent,

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:51.390
still there are clouds.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.510
So you have to use the wind

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:11.110
to remove the clouds.

00:09:11.430 --> 00:09:14.510
Wind of the Holy Ghost.

00:09:15.270 --> 00:09:17.230
And that... you know,

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:24.590
there are many ways of taking advantage of the wind.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:45.630
I hope the Italians understand.

00:09:59.510 --> 00:10:05.790
So the wind comes from some other source,

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:19.870
that is the source of the Holy Ghost, your own Kundalini.

00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:32.270
And also you have in person the Primordial Kundalini before you.

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:47.670
Compared to many other seekers who came before you,

00:10:47.870 --> 00:10:51.350
I must say, you are very fortunate.

00:11:01.510 --> 00:11:03.910
Because worshipping any vigraha,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:12.910
any... even a statue of

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:19.270
self-created vibrations from the Mother Earth,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:22.590
people had big problems.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:41.870
They had to, first of all, do a meditation

00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:46.230
which was called as Savikalpa Samadhi.

00:11:51.710 --> 00:11:53.870
That means, in that state

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:59.550
you had to concentrate on such a statue, vigraha.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:05.390
Vigraha means the one which is a vibrating statue.

00:12:10.190 --> 00:12:14.150
And then, go on looking at that statue

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.110
and trying to raise your Kundalini.

00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:30.870
And Kundalini used to come up to Agnya.

00:12:34.190 --> 00:12:41.270
But the jumping beyond the Sahasrara was an impossible task,

00:12:46.830 --> 00:12:51.990
because one had to go from form to formless,

00:12:56.990 --> 00:13:02.830
and it was so difficult, to get out of form to formless.

00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:14.630
And even to concentrate on abstract or formless

00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:16.870
was another impossible task

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:21.910
as the muslim did, or many other people tried to do.

00:13:37.070 --> 00:13:40.630
Under these circumstances

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:46.630
it was necessary that the formless had to take a form,

00:13:51.310 --> 00:13:55.350
so there was no more complication to you.

00:13:56.190 --> 00:14:03.430
As soon as you concentrated on the form,

00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:06.630
you became formless.

00:14:11.830 --> 00:14:16.710
Like if you have ice before you,

00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:25.190
and as soon as you start touching the ice, it melts away,

00:14:28.790 --> 00:14:31.870
and you start feeling the cool.

00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:37.750
So the problem is very easily solved now.

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:43.510
Puja is one of the things

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:51.550
by which you can excite the forms into formless.

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.510
Now, your centers are the centers of energy.

00:15:10.150 --> 00:15:17.830
But they, too, have a guiding deity sitting on all these chakras.

00:15:25.230 --> 00:15:29.630
They are also the formless made into forms.

00:15:33.790 --> 00:15:36.230
And when you do the puja,

00:15:36.430 --> 00:15:41.230
the forms melt into formless energy,

00:15:48.310 --> 00:15:52.630
and this formless energy then starts flowing,

00:15:59.390 --> 00:16:03.390
and that, then blows the wind.

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.110
And that's how this misidentification,

00:16:10.310 --> 00:16:14.830
superimpositions on the spirit are removed.

00:16:26.110 --> 00:16:29.870
Now, you cannot think about the puja.

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:38.630
The whole thing happens in a realm which is beyond thinking.

00:16:43.070 --> 00:16:46.150
So, you have to understand

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:51.030
that you cannot rationalize the puja.

00:16:54.750 --> 00:17:00.830
You should have the maximum advantage

00:17:06.110 --> 00:17:09.110
on your chakras.

00:17:11.630 --> 00:17:19.590
For that you must fully just concentrate on the puja

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.190
and how the wind is blowing.

00:17:29.590 --> 00:17:31.990
And the wind will see to it,

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:36.510
that they drive out all the clouds.

00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.710
So your only work is,

00:17:47.910 --> 00:17:50.390
or your only method is —

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:56.070
just to concentrate on the puja, and witness.

00:18:02.310 --> 00:18:05.390
You are a seer.

00:18:06.990 --> 00:18:10.070
Seer has double meaning.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:15.470
The one who sees only,

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:20.230
just sees,

00:18:21.510 --> 00:18:24.830
and is only knowledge —

00:18:25.990 --> 00:18:28.990
is a seer.

00:18:29.710 --> 00:18:33.670
Without any thought, without any reaction,

00:18:35.870 --> 00:18:39.150
just sees and absorb,

00:18:39.630 --> 00:18:43.230
automatically, spontaneously —

00:18:45.150 --> 00:18:48.550
is the seer.

00:18:50.350 --> 00:18:57.430
And so, that is the best way to perform a puja.

00:19:00.790 --> 00:19:06.990
For Me sometimes it's burdensome,

00:19:11.790 --> 00:19:18.910
because there should be some parity between you and the deities.

00:19:23.670 --> 00:19:26.670
Some balance must be there.

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:31.990
Here you are saying all the mantras and the deities are awakened,

00:19:32.190 --> 00:19:33.790
and there you are,

00:19:33.990 --> 00:19:38.990
who do not want to receive anything within your heart.

00:19:54.150 --> 00:19:56.910
So I am the one who has to store up

00:19:57.150 --> 00:20:01.710
all the extra energy that is produced in the body.

00:20:10.270 --> 00:20:15.870
So it would be better if you all keep your hearts open

00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:20.750
and watch the puja without thinking about it.

00:20:32.630 --> 00:20:37.630
Today we'll reverse the method of puja.

00:20:40.150 --> 00:20:44.630
First we'll do the havana and then the puja, will be better.

00:20:48.270 --> 00:20:55.190
Because by that we'll evoke the fire element,

00:20:59.670 --> 00:21:06.430
which burns away all the evils.

00:21:10.630 --> 00:21:14.630
When you wash My feet, you do the same thing.

00:21:16.710 --> 00:21:23.070
And even when you evoke the fire, you do the same thing.

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:28.470
So today first we'll have the havana

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.270
and then we'll have the puja.

00:21:36.430 --> 00:21:39.470
Both are just the same.

00:21:40.670 --> 00:21:45.270
You can worship Me with water or with fire.

00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:52.790
The essence of fire is the glow, tejas.

00:21:57.750 --> 00:22:01.990
All that is wrong, all that is evil is burned out,

00:22:02.190 --> 00:22:11.670
and then the glow shows on the faces and the body of the seekers.

00:22:27.550 --> 00:22:31.070
And also atmosphere is charged

00:22:31.270 --> 00:22:35.710
with the beautiful vibrations

00:22:35.910 --> 00:22:39.430
when you have the havana.

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:48.870
So I think best thing will be to do the havan first

00:22:49.070 --> 00:22:53.470
and then the puja.

00:22:57.630 --> 00:23:00.830
May God bless you!

00:23:08.590 --> 00:23:14.350
First always we have to praise Ganesha before starting the puja,

00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:19.270
so you start praising Shri Ganesha.

00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:42.150
Atharva... Atharvashirsha. Ganesha Atharvashirsha.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:45.230
YOGI: Then we'll say [UNCLEAR] in French, so in English [UNCLEAR].

00:23:45.430 --> 00:23:48.470
All right, say it in French.

00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:55.270
I'll better to translate it because there are other people.

00:23:55.470 --> 00:23:58.870
First English and then French.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:04.430
It's all right, I can understand English all right.

00:24:04.630 --> 00:24:08.630
Is all mantras for Me to understand.

00:37:12.390 --> 00:37:17.110
Beautiful. [UNCLEAR] beautiful.

00:37:19.310 --> 00:37:24.430
All right. And now we'll be having the fire. It's all right.

00:38:41.510 --> 00:38:47.270
Now you put some water in it and [PUT?] it to all the people, now.

00:38:48.110 --> 00:38:56.070
Today I would say that from France those who came to see Me,

00:38:56.270 --> 00:38:59.390
from all these places,

00:38:59.590 --> 00:39:05.590
one from each center should come forward.

00:39:47.590 --> 00:39:50.590
These are too big, I think.

00:39:54.390 --> 00:40:00.070
You can put the bigger ones to make a triangle first, [UNCLEAR].

00:40:00.270 --> 00:40:03.510
The bigger ones. Maria?

00:40:09.350 --> 00:40:12.550
The triangle on the three sides.

00:40:24.150 --> 00:40:27.670
One on top of another, this be better.

00:40:39.310 --> 00:40:44.510
[UNCLEAR]. Something like a...

00:40:45.070 --> 00:40:50.230
[UNCLEAR] paper like a... lighter...

00:40:52.790 --> 00:40:55.790
Is that the light thing?

00:40:56.110 --> 00:40:59.910
And have you got camphor with you?

00:41:03.990 --> 00:41:07.990
Something lighter, underneath.

00:41:08.230 --> 00:41:12.230
Do you have anything [UNCLEAR]?

00:41:12.710 --> 00:41:15.590
Make it smaller [UNCLEAR]. Yes.

00:41:15.790 --> 00:41:18.830
Put it on top of this thing, not underneath.

00:41:19.030 --> 00:41:22.390
Not underneath, put it on top. Covering this.

00:41:22.590 --> 00:41:26.430
Yes, put the... on top.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:30.270
Yes, like that, yes, that's right.

00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:47.830
You have to keep a hole in between.

00:41:48.710 --> 00:41:53.550
Arrange it in such a way there is a hole in between, in the center.

00:41:56.430 --> 00:41:58.790
Now arrange on top of this.

00:41:58.990 --> 00:42:03.070
No, this is all right. Please cover with this [UNCLEAR].

00:42:24.150 --> 00:42:28.310
I think there should be a platform first.

00:42:28.510 --> 00:42:30.510
There should be a platform first — and then.

00:42:30.710 --> 00:42:33.910
In the center there should be a platform.

00:42:39.430 --> 00:42:43.550
Just make a platform there, yes, [UNCLEAR].

00:42:45.230 --> 00:42:47.310
And also platform... just wait...

00:42:47.510 --> 00:42:51.150
Markus, on the platform you put another thing.

00:42:52.270 --> 00:42:55.270
That's better, yeah.

00:42:56.790 --> 00:42:59.790
Do you have some more with you?

00:43:03.390 --> 00:43:06.390
[UNCLEAR]

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.590
To begin with that's sufficient.

00:43:57.310 --> 00:43:59.510
You'd like to do 108, [DO YOU?]?

00:43:59.710 --> 00:44:03.310
[UNCLEAR] we just can do 108 of the Goddess

00:44:03.510 --> 00:44:07.710
and 108 of Shri Visnu, [UNCLEAR] better.

00:47:20.630 --> 00:47:25.790
Swa-ha. Swaha is the quality of the... of the fire

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:30.510
which consumes everything. Swa-ha.

00:48:00.150 --> 00:48:04.390
Now, after every name that he takes

00:48:04.590 --> 00:48:07.430
you have to take the thing from your hand like this,

00:48:07.630 --> 00:48:12.670
and take it round to the right side and put it in the fire.

00:48:12.870 --> 00:48:17.310
But those who haven't got these things in the hand

00:48:17.510 --> 00:48:20.390
should take up just their hand like that,

00:48:20.590 --> 00:48:22.870
thinking that they have it in their hand,

00:48:23.110 --> 00:48:28.150
and moving it upward like that and put it in the fire.

00:48:41.270 --> 00:48:44.430
And you all should say "Swaha".

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:53.710
Now, just a minute. After every name, after every name.

00:49:01.230 --> 00:49:04.230
First the Devi.

01:04:39.910 --> 01:04:43.830
Now we'll do the Vishnu Sahasranama, hundred and eight.

01:06:15.990 --> 01:06:19.910
As I said, 21 names of Vishnu are sufficient.

01:10:07.510 --> 01:10:14.710
Now the... first you [UNCLEAR] this, finish it [INAUDIBLE].

01:10:14.910 --> 01:10:18.630
For that you have to use some sort of a fruit.

01:10:18.830 --> 01:10:21.350
Raspberry. Do you have something?

01:10:21.550 --> 01:10:23.910
What is the special fruit of France?

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:26.790
YOGI: A special fruit of France? Apples!

01:10:26.990 --> 01:10:28.510
SHRI MATAJI: Apples, or you should have...

01:10:28.710 --> 01:10:32.510
YOGI: Stem berries... cherries, cherries and grape, grape, Mother!

01:10:32.710 --> 01:10:35.470
SHRI MATAJI: Grape is the best.

01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:39.270
YOGI: [UNCLEAR] just to bless it, Mother.

01:11:11.630 --> 01:11:16.470
SHRI MATAJI: So now, this is the ultimate puja we have done now.

01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:20.870
This is the end of the puja, is finished, throw all that in that.

01:11:21.070 --> 01:11:25.230
All the... all the remaining things are to be thrown.

01:11:28.870 --> 01:11:31.870
Yes, put it.

01:11:46.390 --> 01:11:51.550
Now, we have put today the grapes in it.

01:11:53.350 --> 01:11:58.750
That means the grapes will loose their capacity to ferment.

01:12:18.510 --> 01:12:21.510
That's the best.

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:30.710
The wind is blowing!

01:12:30.910 --> 01:12:37.750
So [THAT'S HOW?] [UNCLEAR] outside [UNCLEAR].

01:12:47.430 --> 01:12:50.910
The main thing was the havan today.

01:13:00.350 --> 01:13:02.790
[UNCLEAR] [AND DRESS UP?].

01:13:02.990 --> 01:13:05.910
YOGI: Mother, the dinner is not ready... the lunch is not ready.

01:13:06.110 --> 01:13:07.150
SHRI MATAJI: Not ready, is it?

01:13:07.350 --> 01:13:10.070
YOGI: Not, yes. In one hour, in one hour.

01:13:10.270 --> 01:13:13.270
SHRI MATAJI: So, we'll finish the puja?
