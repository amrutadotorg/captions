00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:51.240
I'm really a proud Mother to see so many Sahaja yogis.

00:01:55.074 --> 00:01:56.948
And one must understand

00:01:58.574 --> 00:02:01.783
that even if you get few people as newcomers,

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:03.949
they may be few,

00:02:05.574 --> 00:02:11.866
but one has to realize that each one of you

00:02:13.407 --> 00:02:15.366
is now a realized soul.

00:02:17.908 --> 00:02:21.532
Each one of you have grown so much

00:02:22.491 --> 00:02:26.990
that you can create a nucleus yourself.

00:02:28.282 --> 00:02:34.741
And after growing in a collective way together,

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:46.282
now individually the seedlings have become strong shoots now

00:02:46.741 --> 00:02:54.741
and they can definitely be transferred into different places

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.658
and work it out,

00:02:56.908 --> 00:02:59.282
because each one of you is a prophet.

00:03:01.324 --> 00:03:03.491
I wonder if you realize it or not.

00:03:04.741 --> 00:03:07.866
Of course you have got the joy of realization,

00:03:08.282 --> 00:03:10.699
the bliss everything you have got;

00:03:10.948 --> 00:03:12.908
you have grown up to that.

00:03:14.157 --> 00:03:16.824
Slow and steady you have achieved it

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.157
and as you have grown as a tree now,

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:30.115
every one of you is so important and so powerful.

00:03:30.532 --> 00:03:34.824
I know that few people come in, in a collective way,

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:38.407
and you find it difficult in the beginning

00:03:38.699 --> 00:03:39.866
how to deal with them.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:42.157
Because they are still not grown enough;

00:03:43.074 --> 00:03:48.908
they are still not up to the point

00:03:49.824 --> 00:03:53.990
where they really realize their own importance.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:58.074
But you should all understand your own importance

00:03:59.908 --> 00:04:02.783
and your own quality that you have achieved.

00:04:03.824 --> 00:04:06.949
In any other so-called, fake organizations,

00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:10.866
for example say take a church:

00:04:12.532 --> 00:04:14.115
there’s only one priest.

00:04:17.783 --> 00:04:19.574
In the whole locality there is one priest,

00:04:19.824 --> 00:04:22.366
though he doesn’t know anything about it, doesn’t matter.

00:04:23.658 --> 00:04:25.699
But still there’s only one person

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:27.948
who is authorized even by church.

00:04:28.366 --> 00:04:32.574
Everyone has to listen to one person.

00:04:34.658 --> 00:04:38.948
But here, now you all are dynamic people;

00:04:39.407 --> 00:04:43.240
each one of you is capable of giving a good lecture.

00:04:45.074 --> 00:04:48.699
Of course all of you can give realization very well,

00:04:49.032 --> 00:04:50.532
no doubt about it.

00:04:50.908 --> 00:04:53.115
In all your groups you must try

00:04:54.115 --> 00:04:57.574
standing on your own legs.

00:04:58.491 --> 00:05:00.324
Try in your own groups.

00:05:00.616 --> 00:05:04.532
Think of all the dimensions into which you can shoot off.

00:05:04.866 --> 00:05:06.240
Because now you are ready;

00:05:06.532 --> 00:05:10.949
you are now the prophets.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.949
You don’t have to depend on anyone as such,

00:05:15.658 --> 00:05:17.948
or you don’t have to depend on

00:05:18.115 --> 00:05:20.240
your fellow beings also for that.

00:05:20.574 --> 00:05:21.949
Individually you can do it.

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:23.908
Though you are connected with each other,

00:05:24.157 --> 00:05:25.948
you all understand the same language,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.908
you have got the truth together and you are all together;

00:05:30.157 --> 00:05:32.866
But the dynamism must come individually into you

00:05:33.074 --> 00:05:35.407
and every one of you in your own sphere,

00:05:35.616 --> 00:05:37.908
in your own line can work it out,

00:05:38.157 --> 00:05:39.948
because you know all about Sahaja Yog.

00:05:42.407 --> 00:05:46.407
Now those who are half-baked may not know.

00:05:46.658 --> 00:05:49.324
They still are rationalizing maybe something,

00:05:49.616 --> 00:05:51.532
doesn’t matter, they will also be all right.

00:05:52.366 --> 00:05:55.115
But as far as you all are concerned,

00:05:55.366 --> 00:05:56.866
you are all prophets

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.990
and as prophets you must stand up.

00:06:01.366 --> 00:06:03.532
Wherever you go, you talk of Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:03.824 --> 00:06:06.824
tell them that, “This has come to us, this is the light.

00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:08.115
We know everything.”

00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:11.449
I mean you don’t have any doubts about it, isn’t it?

00:06:13.407 --> 00:06:17.407
But the trouble is, that you feel

00:06:18.407 --> 00:06:20.491
that the others may not understand,

00:06:20.824 --> 00:06:23.532
they are stupid people, they are foolish people

00:06:24.491 --> 00:06:26.949
or they are ego oriented or they’re aggressive

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:29.532
or they’ll do this to you or do that to you.

00:06:31.866 --> 00:06:36.699
It’s true, but you must know that

00:06:37.074 --> 00:06:39.616
there’s not only one person who’s fighting it out,

00:06:39.948 --> 00:06:42.783
there are thousands all over the world

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:45.949
who know your language, who know your thing, and

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.282
they all know the same thing.

00:06:49.199 --> 00:06:51.783
So you are not alone fighting it out.

00:06:54.282 --> 00:06:57.990
Once you know that, then you will be amazed

00:06:58.282 --> 00:07:00.948
how much power will start flowing into you.

00:07:03.074 --> 00:07:04.948
The more you think about it,

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:07.908
meditate upon your Self now I would say

00:07:08.908 --> 00:07:11.990
and know that you yourself you are prophets.

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:15.866
And then you'll see the dimensions into which -

00:07:16.115 --> 00:07:18.616
so many are My dimensions sitting here I can see that.

00:07:19.699 --> 00:07:23.282
So in every field, in every walk of life,

00:07:23.574 --> 00:07:24.824
wherever you move,

00:07:25.115 --> 00:07:27.783
you have to talk about it and tell people.

00:07:29.491 --> 00:07:34.240
Now there are certain things, we have made

00:07:34.532 --> 00:07:38.157
certain rules and regulations for Sahaja Yoga, Sahaja yogis.

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:42.449
That is just to see how many are really half-baked

00:07:42.783 --> 00:07:44.699
and how many are full-baked.

00:07:46.574 --> 00:07:50.532
That’s how we have made certain rules and regulations,

00:07:50.616 --> 00:07:54.491
because those who are really full-baked

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.948
will accept them without any difficulties,

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:58.908
they are absolutely there.

00:08:00.658 --> 00:08:02.532
Now as it is we know,

00:08:02.783 --> 00:08:06.032
there are many categories of people who come to us.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:10.199
The people who are top class get into Sahaja Yoga

00:08:10.449 --> 00:08:13.824
without any difficulties, they are top class people.

00:08:14.115 --> 00:08:17.449
They achieve their powers, they assume their powers,

00:08:17.741 --> 00:08:19.491
they start asserting their powers,

00:08:19.783 --> 00:08:21.491
they just become that.

00:08:22.407 --> 00:08:27.449
Like we say we have the complete pattern of the ring with us,

00:08:27.824 --> 00:08:30.240
and only we have to put the diamond there.

00:08:30.449 --> 00:08:31.658
And you find the diamond all right.

00:08:32.491 --> 00:08:34.115
They'll just settle down with it.

00:08:34.741 --> 00:08:37.699
But some people, even after realization,

00:08:37.949 --> 00:08:39.866
go a little bit this side, that side,

00:08:40.074 --> 00:08:42.157
Doesn’t matter, they’ll all come round.

00:08:42.949 --> 00:08:46.366
But those who are top-class people are still,

00:08:46.616 --> 00:08:48.199
I must say, are quite a lot.

00:08:49.324 --> 00:08:52.449
I mean, I can tell you I know so many gurus

00:08:52.658 --> 00:08:55.074
who are real gurus, not these these unreal you forget,

00:08:55.324 --> 00:08:57.282
and the fake you forget, but the real ones also,

00:08:57.532 --> 00:08:59.658
they haven’t got a single one like that,

00:08:59.908 --> 00:09:01.741
not even a single person.

00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:04.948
Like Gagangar Maharaj, he told Me very frankly;

00:09:05.866 --> 00:09:07.948
I said, “Why don’t you give realization to them?”

00:09:08.157 --> 00:09:09.449
He said, “Who gave me realization?

00:09:09.699 --> 00:09:11.574
I had to work very hard.” This, that…

00:09:11.908 --> 00:09:14.783
“All right,” I said, “You had a guru who gave you realization,

00:09:15.032 --> 00:09:17.324
so as a guru it’s your duty to give.”

00:09:17.574 --> 00:09:19.532
And he said, “I’ve given it to one person.

00:09:19.824 --> 00:09:21.699
I worked on him for twenty five years.

00:09:21.948 --> 00:09:23.532
I cleared his Agnya, I cleared everything,

00:09:23.741 --> 00:09:25.990
gave him realization.” “And what is he doing now?”

00:09:26.783 --> 00:09:28.449
He said, “Now you’ll meet him, Mother, some time.

00:09:28.658 --> 00:09:30.240
You must see this fellow, he is horrible

00:09:30.532 --> 00:09:33.990
and he’s the one who is now making money,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.699
running after women.”

00:09:35.949 --> 00:09:39.407
After realization, after twenty five years of his work!

00:09:39.658 --> 00:09:41.866
He said, “I have nothing to do with this man.”

00:09:44.658 --> 00:09:47.074
Now this fellow was called as Anna Maharaj.

00:09:47.324 --> 00:09:49.157
I said, “All right, I’ll have a look at him

00:09:49.407 --> 00:09:50.908
if he comes to Bombay.”

00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:53.741
So he came to Bombay and one of My disciples

00:09:53.990 --> 00:09:55.866
had invited him to his house.

00:09:57.948 --> 00:09:59.491
She’s quite a rich lady

00:09:59.741 --> 00:10:01.699
and she said, “Mother, Anna Maharaj has come

00:10:01.949 --> 00:10:05.407
and You had told that You would like to meet this man

00:10:05.658 --> 00:10:07.449
so he’s come here. Would You come?”

00:10:07.699 --> 00:10:11.407
Went there, he of course touched My feet all right and that,

00:10:11.658 --> 00:10:14.115
but he was smoking in My presence, just imagine.

00:10:14.324 --> 00:10:16.324
He touched My feet and sat down.

00:10:16.574 --> 00:10:20.407
He said, he started talking ill of his guru, first of all,

00:10:20.658 --> 00:10:22.948
the one who worked on him for twenty five years,

00:10:23.157 --> 00:10:24.074
can you imagine?

00:10:24.324 --> 00:10:26.491
I mean you are very kind people; you don’t talk ill of Me.

00:10:27.199 --> 00:10:29.407
I’ve not worked for twenty five years on you

00:10:30.199 --> 00:10:32.407
and look at him, he was talking ill of his guru.

00:10:32.658 --> 00:10:35.115
And he said that, “You see, my guru,

00:10:35.324 --> 00:10:38.449
why should he go to, why should he go to Bombay?

00:10:38.658 --> 00:10:39.990
Now, what is the need?”

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:41.616
Because this fellow was making money in Bombay,

00:10:41.866 --> 00:10:44.990
so he didn’t want his guru to go there, to tell against him.

00:10:45.199 --> 00:10:46.783
“And why should he go to Bombay?

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.157
He should not leave his place?

00:10:48.366 --> 00:10:50.491
He was all right on the, on top of the mountain.

00:10:50.783 --> 00:10:52.616
What was the need for him to come down?”

00:10:52.866 --> 00:10:54.658
and all sorts of things he was talking there.

00:10:54.948 --> 00:10:56.115
I said, “Really?

00:10:56.407 --> 00:10:59.115
That is your guru, you are not to talk ill of him.”

00:11:00.032 --> 00:11:01.324
He said, “But this is true.

00:11:01.574 --> 00:11:03.115
He need not have left the place, you see?”

00:11:04.032 --> 00:11:05.616
And he was still smoking here.

00:11:07.616 --> 00:11:08.990
I said, “All right, now I have to go.”

00:11:09.324 --> 00:11:11.658
With so many women around him

00:11:11.948 --> 00:11:13.366
pressing his feet, this that,

00:11:13.658 --> 00:11:17.658
taking a lot of milk and enjoying himself and smoking

00:11:17.908 --> 00:11:21.948
and talking in a very condescending manner

00:11:22.199 --> 00:11:24.449
to his, so-called disciples.

00:11:24.741 --> 00:11:27.032
Poor things, they were simple people you know.

00:11:28.032 --> 00:11:29.658
I said, “All right, I have to go now.

00:11:30.824 --> 00:11:37.324
So you just put some,

00:11:39.032 --> 00:11:44.616
I’ll give you some kumkum on your forehead.”

00:11:44.908 --> 00:11:47.574
So I took some kumkum and put it on his forehead.

00:11:48.366 --> 00:11:51.157
So his Agnya was just burning, oh,

00:11:51.366 --> 00:11:53.366
absolutely My finger went like this!

00:11:53.574 --> 00:11:55.616
I said, “That’s it.” “Now,”

00:11:55.866 --> 00:11:58.366
I said, “All right now can you I’m going now,

00:11:58.616 --> 00:12:00.282
you put some on My forehead.”

00:12:00.532 --> 00:12:03.949
And I sucked his finger inside, he couldn’t move it.

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:07.199
Just like that, it was all …

00:12:10.491 --> 00:12:11.866
And he said, “Leave me, leave me,

00:12:12.115 --> 00:12:13.908
Mother, I’m sorry, I am sorry!” I said,

00:12:14.032 --> 00:12:17.199
“Now! You just promise you’ll not talk ill of your guru,

00:12:17.449 --> 00:12:18.741
then only I’ll leave you.”

00:12:18.949 --> 00:12:21.282
He said, “All right, all right, all right!

00:12:21.532 --> 00:12:22.990
Please leave me!”

00:12:23.282 --> 00:12:24.948
So I left the finger.

00:12:26.366 --> 00:12:30.449
But see now, the Sahaja yogini lady who was there,

00:12:30.699 --> 00:12:33.074
who has been saved from so many problems

00:12:33.366 --> 00:12:36.074
because she was a clairvoyant person,

00:12:37.658 --> 00:12:42.199
to her he told a lie, is complete lie.

00:12:42.407 --> 00:12:43.908
He said, “I was giving power to Mother.”

00:12:44.115 --> 00:12:45.741
You see they saw it from a distance.

00:12:45.948 --> 00:12:48.366
“So I was shaking because I was giving power” -

00:12:48.616 --> 00:12:50.574
you know, means this shaking was giving Me power!

00:12:51.616 --> 00:12:54.948
But this lady should have understood that when you shake

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:57.157
it means there’s something wrong with you.

00:12:58.074 --> 00:13:00.616
And you know she said that, “Now I will give you

00:13:00.866 --> 00:13:02.948
also such powers as came to Mother.”

00:13:03.199 --> 00:13:05.074
That time it was just the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

00:13:05.324 --> 00:13:07.074
I should say, quite the beginning.

00:13:07.366 --> 00:13:11.282
“So now you better have a Yagya. Hom.

00:13:11.491 --> 00:13:13.407
For that all of you must bring

00:13:13.616 --> 00:13:16.157
one and a quarter tola of gold” -

00:13:16.449 --> 00:13:18.741
that’s about 10 grams.

00:13:19.699 --> 00:13:21.908
“and give it to me.”

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:24.574
That was the beginning of the end.

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:28.240
Now all their money, all their property,

00:13:28.532 --> 00:13:30.199
everything he sucked in somehow.

00:13:30.949 --> 00:13:34.783
And her sister met Me when I was traveling

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:36.990
once from Delhi to Bombay

00:13:37.282 --> 00:13:39.115
and she just fell at My feet and started crying.

00:13:39.199 --> 00:13:40.366
I said, “What’s the matter?”

00:13:40.658 --> 00:13:42.949
She said, “Mother this fellow has looted us.” I said, “Who?”

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:44.948
“The Anna Maharaj.” I said, “How?

00:13:45.157 --> 00:13:47.449
But that day you saw him shaking.

00:13:47.699 --> 00:13:48.990
That’s the thing.”

00:13:49.282 --> 00:13:54.115
So how she was befooled by this fellow

00:13:54.366 --> 00:13:56.532
who told her a complete lie?

00:13:56.824 --> 00:13:59.115
If she had seen the vibrations of this man

00:14:01.199 --> 00:14:02.699
it would have been all right

00:14:02.949 --> 00:14:05.449
and this is what Sahaja yogis forget.

00:14:05.741 --> 00:14:08.324
They are prophets, they have their powers

00:14:08.616 --> 00:14:12.532
but their power is their Spirit, is their vibrations

00:14:12.824 --> 00:14:16.908
and they forget it all the time that,

00:14:17.074 --> 00:14:19.741
“We have got a new awareness, vibratory awareness.

00:14:19.949 --> 00:14:22.449
We have to judge everything on vibrations,”

00:14:22.699 --> 00:14:25.407
and that’s the only failing point of all the prophets.

00:14:29.783 --> 00:14:31.240
If it is untruth -

00:14:31.491 --> 00:14:33.949
I am very innocent you know, I’m very simple minded,

00:14:34.199 --> 00:14:36.157
I just don’t understand things at all.

00:14:36.449 --> 00:14:38.990
You see I don’t know the crookery of man

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:41.699
how he goes round and tells lies and this,

00:14:41.908 --> 00:14:47.282
but on vibrations I know what it is like - absolutely.

00:14:47.574 --> 00:14:48.949
You may tell Me any stories:

00:14:49.199 --> 00:14:51.699
with all your crookery, with all your intelligence

00:14:51.949 --> 00:14:54.366
and all your special sharpness.

00:14:54.616 --> 00:14:56.366
I know what you are up to,

00:14:56.616 --> 00:14:58.783
because only I know it with vibrations.

00:14:59.115 --> 00:15:00.824
But otherwise I am very simple,

00:15:01.115 --> 00:15:04.074
I can’t rationally or anything I can understand,

00:15:04.324 --> 00:15:06.324
but by vibrations I know where you are.

00:15:06.616 --> 00:15:09.366
In the same way you develop your vibratory awareness,

00:15:09.658 --> 00:15:12.074
its sensitivity and try to understand things

00:15:12.282 --> 00:15:14.032
through vibratory awareness.

00:15:14.366 --> 00:15:21.366
If you can do that then you will be perfect prophets.

00:15:23.824 --> 00:15:25.240
You’ll be perfect prophets.

00:15:25.532 --> 00:15:29.324
Now among ourselves also you’ll find there are people

00:15:29.616 --> 00:15:32.115
who are not up to the point.

00:15:32.491 --> 00:15:34.616
Such people should never be trusted,

00:15:34.908 --> 00:15:37.574
should never be trusted because they are half-baked,

00:15:37.866 --> 00:15:40.240
they might become negative, they might become positive.

00:15:40.532 --> 00:15:41.908
So they should not be trusted

00:15:42.115 --> 00:15:45.990
and they should be treated with little reserve.

00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.908
Once they become all right

00:15:49.157 --> 00:15:53.783
then you can take them into your own fold.

00:15:54.074 --> 00:15:56.199
For example recently a girl married

00:15:57.115 --> 00:15:59.074
somebody who is a great Sahaja yogi.

00:16:00.032 --> 00:16:02.324
Now because he said he loved her and all that nonsense,

00:16:02.616 --> 00:16:04.157
so I said, “All right baba you marry her.”

00:16:04.366 --> 00:16:06.866
But I knew that this one is no good, but what to say?

00:16:08.783 --> 00:16:13.491
And then this lady tried, actually she travelled with Me

00:16:13.783 --> 00:16:16.741
and she tried even to clutch My heart

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:19.449
with the bhoots she had, absolutely.

00:16:19.699 --> 00:16:20.866
Twice she did it.

00:16:21.115 --> 00:16:24.658
So cunning, the spirits are so cunning in her,

00:16:24.908 --> 00:16:30.115
that when she went back to Australia, you see,

00:16:30.324 --> 00:16:32.741
she put up a show in such a way that,

00:16:32.949 --> 00:16:35.199
“Oh, she is so insecured

00:16:35.449 --> 00:16:38.407
and her husband doesn’t care for her and this and that.

00:16:40.324 --> 00:16:41.949
And the whole of that Ashram,

00:16:43.157 --> 00:16:45.157
just imagine, would have been lost.

00:16:46.949 --> 00:16:49.449
But I knew something was happening so I trunk called.

00:16:49.783 --> 00:16:51.949
Immediately I found out. I told them, now,

00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:54.157
"see her vibrations!”

00:16:57.741 --> 00:17:00.115
They said, “Mother we don’t find anything wrong with her.”

00:17:00.449 --> 00:17:02.948
That means they never saw her vibration to begin with.

00:17:03.199 --> 00:17:04.990
Because what happens once vibrations are lost,

00:17:05.240 --> 00:17:06.741
you can’t feel anything.

00:17:07.032 --> 00:17:08.908
She has engulfed all of them so much

00:17:09.908 --> 00:17:12.449
that they couldn’t feel anything about her.

00:17:12.783 --> 00:17:14.074
Can you imagine?

00:17:15.115 --> 00:17:16.948
Then rationally I asked a question,

00:17:18.866 --> 00:17:25.948
“Can you replace Warren for his wife?”

00:17:27.699 --> 00:17:29.407
And they got a fright.

00:17:32.199 --> 00:17:34.908
So, one has to be very, very alert about it,

00:17:35.157 --> 00:17:39.699
extremely alert as to these people who are half-baked.

00:17:39.948 --> 00:17:42.616
They will always try to pull you down.

00:17:42.908 --> 00:17:45.949
Half-baked people will always try to pull you down,

00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:48.574
unless and until you are firm enough to pull them up.

00:17:48.866 --> 00:17:52.449
Because they are not doing it, they are not aware of it,

00:17:52.741 --> 00:17:58.032
but they are under the possession of these people,

00:17:58.366 --> 00:17:59.908
and when they do something,

00:18:00.115 --> 00:18:04.032
they try to do all anti-God activities.

00:18:04.948 --> 00:18:08.366
Another one I’ll tell you was in

00:18:16.574 --> 00:18:18.240
Geneva.

00:18:19.157 --> 00:18:22.324
In the beginning I don’t tell openly about a person.

00:18:22.949 --> 00:18:25.240
As far as possible I don’t tell openly

00:18:25.491 --> 00:18:26.616
because it’s not proper.

00:18:26.908 --> 00:18:29.157
Give them a chance, they’ll come up,

00:18:29.407 --> 00:18:32.282
it will work out, doesn’t matter.

00:18:32.608 --> 00:18:33.775
I can manage it.

00:18:34.032 --> 00:18:36.908
But when the nuisance becomes a collective thing,

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.324
then one has to talk about it openly;

00:18:39.532 --> 00:18:42.783
you see, because these people will go to one person,

00:18:43.032 --> 00:18:44.948
say something, another person something,

00:18:45.115 --> 00:18:46.115
third person something.

00:18:46.366 --> 00:18:48.074
So you have to be very alert.

00:18:48.449 --> 00:18:50.658
And they are not aware of it -

00:18:50.908 --> 00:18:52.157
that’s the best part of it,

00:18:52.407 --> 00:18:53.948
they are not aware of what they are doing.

00:18:54.199 --> 00:18:57.074
Like this lady in Geneva would go on asking everyone,

00:18:57.324 --> 00:18:59.949
“What do you think about Mr. X or Mr. Y?”

00:19:00.866 --> 00:19:04.616
All right, so you would say something, if you are negative,

00:19:04.866 --> 00:19:06.449
she would catch hold of that.

00:19:09.199 --> 00:19:12.532
Day before yesterday I was very happy when Ray told Me

00:19:12.824 --> 00:19:16.824
something good about Pamela.

00:19:17.824 --> 00:19:20.574
He said, “Pamela is a very artistic Lady.”

00:19:20.866 --> 00:19:23.240
When you start seeing good points in others

00:19:23.491 --> 00:19:24.658
it gives Me pleasure,

00:19:24.908 --> 00:19:27.115
it gives Me happiness, it gives Me joy.

00:19:27.449 --> 00:19:30.115
But if you start seeing bad points in another

00:19:31.449 --> 00:19:32.949
then I don’t like it.

00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:37.866
Sometimes of course when you - I also test you on that point.

00:19:38.074 --> 00:19:40.658
Sometimes I’ll say something, you see, deliberately:

00:19:40.948 --> 00:19:42.949
I’ll say, “All right something wrong with Ray” -

00:19:43.949 --> 00:19:45.199
I may say.

00:19:45.491 --> 00:19:48.240
I know about whether it is wrong or right,

00:19:48.491 --> 00:19:51.949
just to judge how far you can judge that person.

00:19:53.032 --> 00:19:55.491
Then if you say supporting

00:19:56.574 --> 00:19:58.699
to the right thing that he’s doing,

00:19:59.366 --> 00:20:01.282
then I know that you are right.

00:20:01.532 --> 00:20:04.032
I like it, I appreciate you,

00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:06.240
I really adore you for that.

00:20:06.491 --> 00:20:08.699
That whatever is the truth you should tell Me,

00:20:08.990 --> 00:20:10.741
because I know the truth,

00:20:11.658 --> 00:20:13.074
but I just play around with you

00:20:13.324 --> 00:20:15.366
to see what you think of another person.

00:20:16.324 --> 00:20:19.699
So try to see the good point in another.

00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:23.574
But on one point you should understand,

00:20:23.824 --> 00:20:25.866
if a person is quarrelsome,

00:20:27.783 --> 00:20:30.658
is trying to overpower you

00:20:30.866 --> 00:20:32.407
Birmingham we have a problem like that,

00:20:32.699 --> 00:20:34.658
which I have not yet exposed or said so.

00:20:34.908 --> 00:20:37.574
Still I have kept a secret but I am telling people

00:20:37.908 --> 00:20:39.908
that in Birmingham there’s a problem,

00:20:40.949 --> 00:20:43.616
and that problem comes from one person

00:20:43.866 --> 00:20:45.324
who is not aware of it.

00:20:46.115 --> 00:20:48.699
I will talk to that person; tell that person

00:20:48.949 --> 00:20:51.282
that he should get rid of this problem.

00:20:51.574 --> 00:20:54.574
But if he does not then I have to tell about it openly,

00:20:58.824 --> 00:21:02.449
because I don’t want Birmingham center to be lost.

00:21:02.741 --> 00:21:04.115
We would have lost Geneva;

00:21:04.407 --> 00:21:06.240
I tell you we would have lost it.

00:21:07.407 --> 00:21:09.949
Everybody went against each other

00:21:10.199 --> 00:21:14.074
and big problems were created, by one person.

00:21:15.074 --> 00:21:18.240
Though you are full-baked,

00:21:19.407 --> 00:21:22.366
still you are not so collectively aware

00:21:22.741 --> 00:21:25.115
and appreciative of others, as you should be.

00:21:25.366 --> 00:21:26.783
You are all one.

00:21:27.824 --> 00:21:31.157
Not only appreciation but you can’t do without each other.

00:21:33.616 --> 00:21:37.741
So slow and-steady, as the English character is,

00:21:38.449 --> 00:21:41.449
which is a very good character but it can be very slow.

00:21:44.574 --> 00:21:49.948
Slow-and-steady you must rise about, above your own shells

00:21:50.949 --> 00:21:53.990
and see the beauty of another Sahaja yogi

00:21:54.990 --> 00:21:57.949
and see the point that are good in that person

00:21:58.157 --> 00:21:59.240
so that you imbibe.

00:21:59.491 --> 00:22:01.532
Some people have certain capacities.

00:22:03.366 --> 00:22:07.783
And surprisingly then, I talked to Pamela about Ray

00:22:08.032 --> 00:22:09.948
and she praised him a lot

00:22:10.199 --> 00:22:13.407
and that really made Me extremely happy,

00:22:13.658 --> 00:22:16.616
though I must say Brighton may not have been

00:22:16.866 --> 00:22:19.449
so bright yesterday in the program,

00:22:19.741 --> 00:22:21.783
there were few people but doesn’t matter.

00:22:23.324 --> 00:22:24.824
This is very energy giving

00:22:25.074 --> 00:22:28.157
to see that Sahaja yogis appreciate each other.

00:22:29.282 --> 00:22:31.115
Now somebody has a problem,

00:22:31.407 --> 00:22:35.282
say left-sided people always have a problem in My lecture;

00:22:35.574 --> 00:22:36.948
they go off to sleep,

00:22:37.157 --> 00:22:39.532
naturally, they have to. [Laughter]

00:22:46.783 --> 00:22:48.199
It doesn’t matter whatsoever,

00:22:48.449 --> 00:22:50.366
I am working on them even if they are sleeping.

00:22:51.699 --> 00:22:53.115
But when I work on them

00:22:53.407 --> 00:22:56.574
I have to sleep Myself to go into them, see?

00:22:56.783 --> 00:22:59.532
So that drag is there, it doesn’t matter it will come up.

00:22:59.824 --> 00:23:01.824
There are ways and methods of how to work it out.

00:23:02.783 --> 00:23:04.990
But that’s not so important to Me,

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.990
what is important is, are you sleeping

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.948
towards your fellow men,

00:23:13.574 --> 00:23:15.407
fellow Sahaja yogis?

00:23:16.449 --> 00:23:18.324
Are you alert about them?

00:23:19.866 --> 00:23:24.032
They are just like your hands, eyes, nose, everything.

00:23:24.282 --> 00:23:25.783
You are all one.

00:23:25.949 --> 00:23:27.908
You cannot do without each other,

00:23:28.948 --> 00:23:31.407
because you are the only people

00:23:31.616 --> 00:23:34.240
who have now got the eyes to see.

00:23:35.324 --> 00:23:37.574
You are the only people who are aware.

00:23:40.949 --> 00:23:42.407
And we are not few.

00:23:43.407 --> 00:23:45.616
We think that we are very few.

00:23:46.199 --> 00:23:48.491
You see , maybe then the other gurus they might get

00:23:48.741 --> 00:23:50.948
thousands of them, they are useless -

00:23:51.157 --> 00:23:52.824
as they go, they come out.

00:23:53.032 --> 00:23:57.741
Maybe added up, tails and horns they might have!

00:23:59.908 --> 00:24:01.866
But they are not aware people.

00:24:04.157 --> 00:24:06.032
And you are aware.

00:24:07.074 --> 00:24:09.783
On one side you have to pull out the people

00:24:09.990 --> 00:24:13.074
who are not aware so much,

00:24:14.032 --> 00:24:16.407
on the other side you have to appreciate people

00:24:16.658 --> 00:24:18.032
who are more aware.

00:24:21.358 --> 00:24:23.524
And this is what one has to understand.

00:32:01.059 --> 00:32:03.433
with little less than what it is.

00:32:05.226 --> 00:32:08.059
I have to tell you, you should say it with little more,

00:32:09.308 --> 00:32:11.642
if you have to make the bull move you see?

00:32:12.517 --> 00:32:14.267
Say little more than you can say

00:32:14.517 --> 00:32:16.184
because whatever you say is not more, and

00:32:16.350 --> 00:32:17.976
this is the Infinite.

00:32:22.101 --> 00:32:25.142
But it should not be also so much that they can’t bear it.

00:32:25.350 --> 00:32:30.642
Like Warren had an experience which I told him,

00:32:30.809 --> 00:32:33.017
“Only tell the Sahaja Yogis, don’t tell anybody else

00:32:33.226 --> 00:32:34.725
because they’ll never believe it.”

00:32:35.642 --> 00:32:37.308
There was no petrol in his car

00:32:37.642 --> 00:32:39.725
and he had to go for a propaganda work

00:32:40.684 --> 00:32:42.184
and he went round.

00:32:43.266 --> 00:32:45.184
And he did all his propaganda for eight days

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:48.517
and when they came back the petrol was not available.

00:32:48.809 --> 00:32:50.725
At the petrol pump the fellow said,

00:32:50.831 --> 00:32:54.349
“Your petrol is full, why do you want to have petrol in?”

00:32:55.895 --> 00:32:57.062
Why not?

00:33:03.104 --> 00:33:04.146
That can be done,

00:33:04.479 --> 00:33:06.937
but don’t tell anybody else because they’ll just say

00:33:07.187 --> 00:33:09.646
this is cock-and-bull story, you see.

00:33:11.813 --> 00:33:16.187
You see you have heard the story of the bread and the fishes.

00:33:16.937 --> 00:33:19.104
Because in the Bible it is so, we believe it.

00:33:19.313 --> 00:33:20.521
Why not today?

00:33:22.479 --> 00:33:24.813
You have seen so many things happening like that,

00:33:25.021 --> 00:33:27.771
I mean so many things in your own lifetime.

00:33:28.021 --> 00:33:30.563
But all these things if you tell them, they won’t believe.

00:33:30.895 --> 00:33:36.271
So your wisdom is in believing

00:33:36.521 --> 00:33:39.855
that you are in the realm of God and He is Almighty,

00:33:40.855 --> 00:33:42.396
and that He is going to give you

00:33:42.605 --> 00:33:44.937
everything that you want and aspire for.

00:33:49.979 --> 00:33:52.062
People won’t believe it I know.

00:33:54.021 --> 00:33:58.187
But it’s true, whatever is desired you can get it,

00:33:59.229 --> 00:34:01.313
but if you tell people they won’t believe.

00:34:01.563 --> 00:34:03.979
But as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

00:34:04.187 --> 00:34:06.146
you have to make a statement

00:34:06.438 --> 00:34:10.563
which is not reserved but open,

00:34:10.855 --> 00:34:12.396
with confidence.

00:34:14.521 --> 00:34:16.730
The diffidence that is put into it

00:34:16.937 --> 00:34:20.187
because of this training is not good.

00:34:21.354 --> 00:34:24.895
With confidence, “Yes it is so! It is so!

00:34:25.062 --> 00:34:26.521
This is what it is.”

00:34:34.479 --> 00:34:40.521
Like first when I went to India, Raul Bai,

00:34:40.771 --> 00:34:42.730
you know such an elderly lady, an Indian lady

00:34:43.979 --> 00:34:45.563
they feel little shy about everything.

00:34:45.896 --> 00:34:47.937
She’s the one with full hand up in the air.

00:34:48.187 --> 00:34:50.771
She was shouting, “Bolo Mataji Nirmala Devi!”

00:34:51.688 --> 00:34:55.937
and Modi looked at her, he couldn’t raise his hand, you see.

00:34:56.021 --> 00:34:57.313
He was a little shy.

00:34:57.563 --> 00:34:59.855
But she went thrice and then she lifted his hand and said,

00:35:00.021 --> 00:35:02.146
“What’s the matter with you, such a tall man?

00:35:02.354 --> 00:35:04.146
Why God has given you height for what?

00:35:04.396 --> 00:35:05.605
To raise your hands only.”

00:35:05.895 --> 00:35:08.438
And poor fellow he had to raise his hand.

00:35:10.146 --> 00:35:11.563
So that’s what it is.

00:35:13.354 --> 00:35:14.813
Have boldness,

00:35:15.062 --> 00:35:17.730
have complete confidence in your self,

00:35:17.937 --> 00:35:19.855
that you are realized souls,

00:35:22.688 --> 00:35:24.354
that you are prophets.

00:35:25.979 --> 00:35:28.354
Not to be upset or worried about things

00:35:28.605 --> 00:35:30.146
but you are prophets now.

00:35:30.479 --> 00:35:32.062
Assumption!

00:35:34.062 --> 00:35:36.896
In Sanskrit is said viraj.

00:35:39.438 --> 00:35:44.438
That is the energy is permeated -

00:35:44.730 --> 00:35:49.479
viraj: means enjoy that energy within you.

00:35:49.730 --> 00:35:51.563
Viraj, “Ra” is energy;

00:35:51.813 --> 00:35:56.104
“Viraj” means you enjoy that energy of that throne,

00:35:57.229 --> 00:35:58.730
assume it.

00:35:59.021 --> 00:36:02.396
You are the kings now, behave in that manner.

00:36:02.688 --> 00:36:06.354
It is not arrogance at all.

00:36:06.646 --> 00:36:08.730
A person who is a king is never arrogant,

00:36:08.896 --> 00:36:09.979
if he’s a real king.

00:36:10.229 --> 00:36:12.354
You see if they are borrowed kings then it’s different.

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:16.021
But if they are real kings they can never be arrogant.

00:36:18.563 --> 00:36:23.730
So with that special type of royal behavior

00:36:24.730 --> 00:36:26.146
you will attract people.

00:36:28.646 --> 00:36:31.104
It’s not putting up show, is you are!

00:36:31.396 --> 00:36:33.730
On the contrary this is the reservation you are having,

00:36:33.937 --> 00:36:35.104
for what?

00:36:39.104 --> 00:36:43.271
You need not dress up like beggars or like dandies,

00:36:44.313 --> 00:36:47.062
but your dress should be such that you are a king,

00:36:47.313 --> 00:36:48.895
not bothered.

00:36:51.104 --> 00:36:53.895
And you’ll be amazed it will work out.

00:36:55.479 --> 00:37:00.396
You are the people who have the greatest of My time

00:37:00.688 --> 00:37:02.104
and company

00:37:03.895 --> 00:37:06.021
and also I know your language.

00:37:06.354 --> 00:37:09.688
I have given more speeches in English than in Mine own,

00:37:09.937 --> 00:37:13.229
My own mother tongue or in Hindi. Can you believe it?

00:37:16.479 --> 00:37:18.563
And so many Indians now,

00:37:18.813 --> 00:37:22.021
who did not much care for English after independence,

00:37:22.271 --> 00:37:23.895
are trying to learn English now

00:37:24.104 --> 00:37:26.146
and they are afraid that one day

00:37:26.354 --> 00:37:28.313
English may replace Sanskrit,

00:37:28.563 --> 00:37:30.688
the way Mother knows English.

00:37:35.271 --> 00:37:39.937
So, I have to make a very, very simple request to you,

00:37:40.146 --> 00:37:42.855
that assume, assume your powers.

00:37:43.021 --> 00:37:44.521
Assume.

00:37:47.313 --> 00:37:48.813
You are no more slaves.

00:37:51.896 --> 00:37:53.979
You are realized souls now.

00:37:54.521 --> 00:38:00.563
With this personality

00:38:02.062 --> 00:38:04.979
you will really enhance the beauty of Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:06.396 --> 00:38:08.730
Unless and until there are flowers on the tree,

00:38:08.937 --> 00:38:10.354
the tree has no meaning

00:38:10.646 --> 00:38:13.563
and the flowers have to be up!

00:38:13.855 --> 00:38:14.937
They don’t hide,

00:38:15.187 --> 00:38:17.813
have you ever seen any flower hiding itself?

00:38:19.771 --> 00:38:24.688
They cover the whole of the body of the trees and fragrant,

00:38:24.896 --> 00:38:26.521
assuming their own powers.

00:38:27.521 --> 00:38:29.605
And the fragrance springs.

00:38:29.937 --> 00:38:31.813
Everybody knows the flowers are up,

00:38:32.146 --> 00:38:33.438
all the bees are round there.

00:38:34.229 --> 00:38:35.895
That’s how you have to be.

00:38:36.146 --> 00:38:42.229
Assume your powers - inside, outside, both.

00:38:42.479 --> 00:38:45.396
Not only inside, outside and in side.

00:38:45.688 --> 00:38:47.896
And they’ll be amazed at your confidence,

00:38:48.104 --> 00:38:49.563
at your compassion,

00:38:49.813 --> 00:38:52.813
at your capacities and the greatest of all,

00:38:53.771 --> 00:38:55.146
the complete vidya,

00:38:55.479 --> 00:38:58.979
the complete knowledge of Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:59.313 --> 00:39:01.271
the complete knowledge of Kundalini,

00:39:01.521 --> 00:39:04.563
the complete the complete knowledge of Divine which you have.

00:39:10.563 --> 00:39:11.730
All right?

00:39:35.730 --> 00:39:38.229
Now Gavin, whichever way you want,

00:39:38.521 --> 00:39:40.062
you can do the puja.

00:40:07.895 --> 00:40:09.062
Gavin, come along …

00:40:09.605 --> 00:40:13.979
You should have names and things. And Marcus.

00:40:36.396 --> 00:40:37.855
Ganesh Puja, Mother?

00:40:38.521 --> 00:40:40.896
Ganesha has come!

00:40:44.104 --> 00:40:45.895
So you also know Sanskrit ….

00:40:49.021 --> 00:40:51.813
Both are learning Sanskrit.

00:41:18.313 --> 00:41:19.979
Yogi: Should all those who haven’t done

00:41:21.021 --> 00:41:22.396
Your puja before be called up?

00:41:23.605 --> 00:41:26.730
All right, but not absolutely new people.

00:41:27.354 --> 00:41:31.479
Not absolutely new, but those …

00:41:37.062 --> 00:41:39.229
If they want to do it, it’s all right.

00:41:39.688 --> 00:41:43.104
But you see, the problem is they’re absolutely new people.

00:41:43.104 --> 00:41:45.855
But in France is worked...

00:41:46.646 --> 00:41:49.438
Yogi: Some people have come from outside

00:41:49.896 --> 00:41:51.229
and may not have had a puja.

00:41:51.688 --> 00:41:53.396
Outside from where?

00:41:55.646 --> 00:41:57.979
Yes, there’s a gentleman from Devon, Mother.

00:41:58.229 --> 00:42:03.895
Is there? Good, that’s nice. And also, you see, in France

00:42:04.146 --> 00:42:05.855
it really clicked there.

00:42:06.104 --> 00:42:08.062
We had the puja next day and we called those people

00:42:08.354 --> 00:42:10.895
who got realization. And they really clicked, you see,

00:42:10.895 --> 00:42:13.896
they were very sensible because they were seekers.

00:42:14.229 --> 00:42:16.479
They understood the meaning, and not only these Algerians ….

00:42:16.479 --> 00:42:19.771
These Muslims, how good they were –

00:42:19.771 --> 00:42:22.354
absolutely top-class.

00:42:22.605 --> 00:42:25.062
Top-class people, you know.

00:42:31.146 --> 00:42:32.354
What’s his name, that lawyer?

00:42:46.771 --> 00:42:48.813
Aychala. He’s a wonderful man, isn’t it?

00:42:49.895 --> 00:42:51.813
His wife … And he said, “This is the Resurrection Time;

00:42:52.146 --> 00:42:54.563
what is there to question?”

00:42:58.730 --> 00:43:01.396
And he’s a lawyer, and his wife also?

00:43:07.396 --> 00:43:13.313
I tell you, he brought fourteen people by plane. Yes, he did.

00:43:20.605 --> 00:43:21.354
All right.

00:43:21.771 --> 00:43:24.688
So if the new people do not form any barrier,

00:43:24.937 --> 00:43:27.187
it’s all right. They can come and wash My feet.

00:43:27.563 --> 00:43:28.438
It helps always.

00:43:28.771 --> 00:43:30.730
But if you have barriers, don’t do it.

00:43:31.062 --> 00:43:33.479
Just don’t do it. You see, it doesn’t help Me,

00:43:33.813 --> 00:43:38.730
it helps you. Some people think that by washing My feet,

00:43:39.104 --> 00:43:42.187
I can save one washing or whatever it is!

00:43:49.895 --> 00:43:53.646
So it’s a privilege, and if you have to do it,

00:43:53.937 --> 00:43:55.646
you should do it – is good for you,

00:43:55.979 --> 00:43:57.895
you’ll immediately settle down into your realization.

00:43:58.313 --> 00:44:00.979
So those who are new people can come.

00:44:01.646 --> 00:44:05.354
And you have to wash My feet first of all.

00:44:13.563 --> 00:44:15.896
He understands so much, I tell you!

00:44:16.813 --> 00:44:19.146
My grandchildren, they are –

00:44:19.521 --> 00:44:22.438
they understand the protocol so much.

00:44:23.521 --> 00:44:27.646
He took off My socks and put on top of the head of – his top!

00:44:34.396 --> 00:44:35.813
They understand so much, it’s …

00:44:36.229 --> 00:44:38.438
Nick was telling Me that we have to learn

00:44:38.771 --> 00:44:40.313
from children so many protocols.

00:44:40.896 --> 00:44:42.021
He took it out for Me today, she said,

00:44:42.396 --> 00:44:45.855
for puja evening, and I think I’ll leave it to use.

00:44:49.688 --> 00:44:53.187
So, those people who are new, please come.

00:44:53.605 --> 00:44:54.563
They should do the puja.

00:44:55.062 --> 00:44:56.354
They have the privilege,

00:44:56.730 --> 00:44:59.813
not the one who … Who has come from Devon?

00:45:00.229 --> 00:45:07.646
Great! Come along. Come along, come along. Good.

00:45:10.813 --> 00:45:13.354
As from Brighton who are the people

00:45:13.855 --> 00:45:15.771
who should come and wash My feet,

00:45:16.146 --> 00:45:18.438
because that’s the best way to settle you down

00:45:18.771 --> 00:45:21.688
into your realization.

00:45:28.895 --> 00:45:30.688
He is to be the first?

00:45:31.104 --> 00:45:33.896
They understand the privileges. Very good.

00:45:40.354 --> 00:45:42.313
I think Paul, I think you should wash My feet,

00:45:42.646 --> 00:45:47.313
better wash My feet. Good. Aha, that’s good.

00:45:51.313 --> 00:45:54.730
Better take a mantra.

00:46:00.313 --> 00:46:01.771
By the way, whom did I give that thing

00:46:02.146 --> 00:46:04.646
I had brought for you that … day?

00:46:05.021 --> 00:46:09.521
To wash My feet? Whom did I donate it?

00:46:10.062 --> 00:46:12.563
Did I give it to you people?

00:46:17.563 --> 00:46:20.937
The big thing. No, no, recently.

00:46:21.438 --> 00:46:26.813
Ask Marcus. Marcus, we had that silver thing, big thing?

00:46:28.855 --> 00:46:30.730
Big thing like this?

00:46:36.521 --> 00:46:39.646
No, no, not that.

00:46:42.563 --> 00:46:44.979
It was from England only.

00:46:50.605 --> 00:46:54.438
I think the Lane. Must be there.

00:46:55.271 --> 00:46:56.895
Yogi: You gave me one at Your house, Mother,

00:46:57.313 --> 00:46:58.688
to give to Nightingale Lane.

00:47:05.187 --> 00:47:09.146
Did I? Where is it? You must bring that.

00:47:09.563 --> 00:47:10.730
You see, that’s a very good one.

00:47:11.021 --> 00:47:12.979
It’s surprising that, that I had it with Me,

00:47:13.521 --> 00:47:16.813
this was from England, and I brought it back for you.

00:47:17.937 --> 00:47:21.396
Made in England, can you imagine? In Sheffield!

00:47:26.313 --> 00:47:29.937
So I brought it back to you, that you can use it.

00:47:30.479 --> 00:47:32.438
So next time you bring that, because stainless steel is

00:47:33.021 --> 00:47:35.646
not so good as that thing is, you see?

00:47:37.271 --> 00:47:40.021
So now, you will say the mantras, no?

00:47:41.354 --> 00:47:42.730
With Shri Ganesha’s, first of all.

00:47:43.104 --> 00:47:45.187
Have you got that?

00:47:45.688 --> 00:47:48.396
… So how will you do it on My feet?

00:47:59.146 --> 00:48:03.187
On My feet you use the ghee with this.

00:48:03.771 --> 00:48:07.021
Little bit of this coconut should be saved for after this ….

00:48:11.730 --> 00:48:14.438
All right. Hundred-and-eight names.

00:48:16.563 --> 00:48:19.354
But he has got translation, necessary too – oh, that one.

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.021
Let him read his translation of,

00:48:22.438 --> 00:48:25.688
because this is for the new people.

00:48:25.688 --> 00:48:27.229
This is the Shri Ganesha

00:48:27.646 --> 00:48:30.479
who incarnated as our Lord Jesus Christ,

00:48:31.104 --> 00:48:35.229
and this was written fourteen thousand years back.

00:48:35.563 --> 00:48:37.396
It’s been translated, so you can see now

00:48:37.730 --> 00:48:39.895
how His coming was already there,

00:48:40.313 --> 00:48:42.563
and how the things that are written in here

00:48:42.937 --> 00:48:47.187
show the complete picture of Christ – which He is,

00:48:47.605 --> 00:48:48.771
which people do not know, you see.

00:48:49.062 --> 00:48:51.354
They talk of Christ, Christ, Christ – what Christ is?

00:48:51.605 --> 00:48:52.479
Let’s see.

00:48:52.771 --> 00:48:55.187
Now, Gavin, can you stand up and read it?

00:48:56.396 --> 00:48:58.563
No, no, that’s all right, forward it, just forward it.

00:48:59.438 --> 00:49:04.354
Now, who will – why don’t you ask somebody to read,

00:49:04.730 --> 00:49:06.855
because we have to come ….

00:49:08.771 --> 00:49:11.021
Jeremy? Read it, loudly.

00:49:53.563 --> 00:49:55.646
Let all the children to wash My feet.

00:50:02.895 --> 00:50:04.563
Let the children do it first.

00:50:05.062 --> 00:50:06.146
That’s better. Shona!

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.730
Let Olympia come in.

00:50:14.771 --> 00:50:17.021
Olympia, come here.

00:50:21.896 --> 00:50:23.771
Come, come.

00:50:38.605 --> 00:50:39.813
Who else is there?

00:50:48.313 --> 00:50:49.937
You’ll have to wash My feet. All right?

00:50:50.354 --> 00:50:51.979
Everybody has to wash My feet. Come along.

00:50:52.813 --> 00:50:53.605
Now sit down there.

00:50:53.979 --> 00:50:55.730
Everybody’s going to wash My feet. All right?

00:50:56.396 --> 00:50:59.646
That’s it. Now come along. Get the water. Amit, sit down.

00:50:59.937 --> 00:51:03.104
Take out your shoes. Must take out shoes ….

00:51:08.605 --> 00:51:13.354
Sit down, sit down …

00:51:15.730 --> 00:51:19.605
Sit down, sit down. Sit down here, just like that.

00:51:20.313 --> 00:51:24.771
Please sit down. Now will you sit down! Sit down!

00:51:30.605 --> 00:51:32.771
Sit down. Now put the water, come along.

00:51:33.104 --> 00:51:35.104
You put the water, just come along …

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.855
ow see everybody’s doing it. Come along.

00:51:38.354 --> 00:51:42.271
Aha! Who will do it? Oh, oh, all right.

00:51:59.062 --> 00:51:59.855
Give him that hand.

00:52:00.229 --> 00:52:01.688
Where is that – Katie?

00:52:02.229 --> 00:52:04.021
Just call her.

00:52:06.229 --> 00:52:08.730
Right hand, right hand, you give the right hand.

00:52:09.271 --> 00:52:11.688
No, no, no, don’t cry.

00:52:12.104 --> 00:52:15.479
Don’t cry. Don’t cry. Where is Katie? Call Katie.

00:52:15.896 --> 00:52:18.605
Now wash it, wash it. Come along, come along.

00:52:20.521 --> 00:52:21.813
Come along, come along. She can do it.

00:52:22.605 --> 00:52:24.521
She can do it. She’s big now. She can do it. ….

00:52:28.021 --> 00:52:32.271
It’s all right now, see, it’s cool breeze coming.

00:52:32.979 --> 00:52:35.895
Good, good, good. Come along, Katie, come along.

00:52:36.271 --> 00:52:37.771
Katie has come, see?

00:52:38.229 --> 00:52:41.062
ow Katie has come. Come along, Katie.

00:52:49.521 --> 00:52:51.730
Come along, Katie, you do it.

00:54:10.895 --> 00:54:12.021
See, everybody’s doing it.

00:54:12.438 --> 00:54:15.229
All the children are doing it. All right.

00:54:32.605 --> 00:54:34.438
You see, this is what is the point,

00:54:34.895 --> 00:54:37.605
that when you get realization the spirit is awakened –

00:54:37.937 --> 00:54:41.146
that is Christ – and that you listen.

00:54:41.563 --> 00:54:44.979
“His presence in you”: with that you listen.

00:54:45.479 --> 00:54:48.229
Means with the spirit, you see, the point is.

00:54:48.730 --> 00:54:52.438
That’s what He said: the Comforter will come and

00:54:53.104 --> 00:54:56.813
He will, or She will, whatever it is,

00:54:57.229 --> 00:55:00.021
will make you comfort in such a way that you

00:55:00.021 --> 00:55:05.438
will reside forever in My Father –

00:55:05.813 --> 00:55:08.187
or would remember My Father forever.

00:55:08.605 --> 00:55:10.855
That’s the spirit you remember.

00:57:35.396 --> 00:57:38.979
That’s the spirit, you see? See now, hear this.

01:02:41.104 --> 01:02:43.605
Can you imagine, he’s here!

01:02:44.271 --> 01:02:47.271
You have never washed it ….

01:02:54.104 --> 01:02:56.813
Grace, you rub with your hands in the water.

01:02:57.187 --> 01:03:00.688
Just rub it. Come along. Just rub it, in the water.

01:03:01.021 --> 01:03:02.646
Rub hard. You have to rub with your fingers.

01:03:03.062 --> 01:03:04.354
You see, My Feet are perfectly all right.

01:03:04.771 --> 01:03:06.146
Nothing happens to Them.

01:03:06.521 --> 01:03:09.396
Rub as hard as you can.

01:03:19.646 --> 01:03:21.937
Yogi: The names of the Goddess, as Shri Lalita.

01:03:22.813 --> 01:03:24.521
Loudly, now, you stand up.

01:03:25.021 --> 01:03:26.730
Would you do it?

01:03:27.187 --> 01:03:29.187
Good idea, because … Can you put it for him?

01:03:32.688 --> 01:03:35.062
All right, just stand here …

01:03:35.855 --> 01:03:38.521
Translation, otherwise these people won’t understand.

01:04:29.771 --> 01:04:31.438
Can you sit down, would be better.

01:04:32.062 --> 01:04:34.979
We can … Mother Earth … vibrations.

01:04:35.479 --> 01:04:36.771
Very loudly now.

01:05:19.438 --> 01:05:21.313
Can you put “sakshat”, that would be better …

01:05:26.104 --> 01:05:26.979
Not so much.

01:05:27.896 --> 01:05:30.187
“Mataji Nirmala Devi” would be better ….

01:05:40.271 --> 01:05:41.146
At the beginning you say.

01:05:43.563 --> 01:05:45.688
Once you’ve said it, it’s all right.

01:05:54.646 --> 01:05:56.229
Now you’ll be sure of it, all right?

01:05:56.229 --> 01:05:57.895
May God bless you.

01:05:58.605 --> 01:06:00.688
She’s sure of it. It’s better now.

01:06:17.563 --> 01:06:19.021
These are all the secrets of ….

01:06:19.396 --> 01:06:21.396
All right, but you don’t see that ….

01:06:31.313 --> 01:06:34.062
All the horrifying things you have chosen there to read!

01:06:39.229 --> 01:06:43.855
Ra, Ra-dha: is to .… means the one, “Ra” is the energy …

01:06:48.646 --> 01:06:50.895
which permeates, permeates.

01:06:57.229 --> 01:07:01.605
Radha is … Ra is energy of Radha.

01:07:24.104 --> 01:07:25.813
Again horrifying things now!

01:07:26.688 --> 01:07:28.896
In the beginning they’d say all horrifying things

01:07:29.354 --> 01:07:31.438
to settle you down, I think, that’s why ….

01:07:33.521 --> 01:07:34.813
All right.

01:07:39.187 --> 01:07:40.730
All right, now go ahead.

01:07:55.855 --> 01:07:57.688
Sugar-cane now!

01:08:10.062 --> 01:08:11.646
She’s the causal elements.

01:08:12.855 --> 01:08:14.021
Causal elements, you see? Causal.

01:08:17.438 --> 01:08:20.563
Like the causal of the Mother Earth is fragrance.

01:08:21.021 --> 01:08:23.813
Fragrance is the causal of the Mother Earth.

01:09:00.104 --> 01:09:04.021
You see, the emission of vibrations through the aura

01:09:06.187 --> 01:09:08.895
engulfs all the other auras into it

01:09:09.688 --> 01:09:12.813
All the Mother Earth.

01:10:42.895 --> 01:10:46.521
That means …. She’s full moon of musk.

01:10:56.104 --> 01:10:58.396
She’s full moon of musk.

01:11:02.563 --> 01:11:03.896
They, you see, they have tried to put

01:11:04.438 --> 01:11:06.521
all poetic ideas to describe something.

01:12:00.438 --> 01:12:01.438
You see, the thing is, it’s a difference:

01:12:01.937 --> 01:12:03.313
it’s beauty and auspiciousness.

01:12:03.896 --> 01:12:05.771
Auspiciousness is the face, you see,

01:12:06.146 --> 01:12:11.563
that gives you shubha – shubha means “that brings good luck.”

01:12:11.979 --> 01:12:14.937
The face you see brings you good luck.

01:12:15.396 --> 01:12:17.479
That is known as auspicious.

01:12:17.937 --> 01:12:19.563
Of course, I mean, modern people don’t believe

01:12:19.937 --> 01:12:22.396
in such a face like that, that there could be a face.

01:12:22.730 --> 01:12:25.563
But there can be a face which if you see,

01:12:26.062 --> 01:12:29.895
then it brings you good luck. Auspicious.

01:13:08.646 --> 01:13:10.979
Yogi: Salutations to Her, the diamonds

01:13:11.521 --> 01:13:14.730
of whose nose outshine even the stars.

01:13:18.313 --> 01:13:20.688
That’s why I don’t wear anything there!

01:13:54.354 --> 01:13:58.229
It’s of the joy of beauty. So the Sahaja yogis enjoy

01:13:59.313 --> 01:14:02.354
the beauty of those flowers which She wears.

01:14:04.146 --> 01:14:06.229
Because of vibrations, it’s that.

01:14:06.605 --> 01:14:08.438
You see, it’s a simple thing is that anything

01:14:08.813 --> 01:14:10.688
You touch becomes vibrated,

01:14:11.104 --> 01:14:13.521
and if you see that particular flower you are more happy,

01:14:13.896 --> 01:14:15.104
because it’s had vibrations.

01:14:15.521 --> 01:14:18.605
Vibration is the one which only gives this.

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:23.021
Lotus of – the lotus of love. ….

01:15:48.146 --> 01:15:49.646
Which means, which comes out of the kapol.

01:15:50.104 --> 01:15:52.021
It is the description.

01:15:52.688 --> 01:15:55.271
Kapol is this one, so this is the part they are describing.

01:16:08.479 --> 01:16:11.855
See, padmaraag, padmaraag is the fragrance of the lotus.

01:16:12.313 --> 01:16:15.813
Is the raag, means the energy of the lotus is coming out

01:16:16.271 --> 01:16:18.730
of Her forehead.

01:16:19.937 --> 01:16:22.229
No, from this, kapal and this is kapol.

01:16:22.730 --> 01:16:26.062
Kapol is – I’m sorry: this is kapal, this is kapol, cheeks.

01:16:29.771 --> 01:16:34.896
The energy that flows from the cheeks is the energy

01:16:35.895 --> 01:16:40.187
of the raag, means, raag actually means love,

01:16:40.605 --> 01:16:44.605
compassion – of a lotus.

01:16:59.730 --> 01:17:01.479
Like the new leaves.

01:17:02.521 --> 01:17:06.354
Vidru is “new leaves,” you see. Like the new leaves.

01:17:18.855 --> 01:17:20.813
What is the translation?

01:17:32.271 --> 01:17:34.937
It’s a very big thing, but it’s very poetic,

01:17:36.104 --> 01:17:40.896
it’s rather embarrassing.

01:17:41.979 --> 01:17:43.479
It’s rather embarrassing! All right.

01:17:54.021 --> 01:17:59.479
Blue. Like the blue leaves, you see, of that color.

01:18:00.563 --> 01:18:02.479
You see the color of the new leaves –

01:18:02.896 --> 01:18:04.979
isn’t it pinkish-red, isn’t it?

01:18:05.438 --> 01:18:07.438
So Her lips are of that color,

01:18:07.855 --> 01:18:11.563
which will put shame to even those blue leaves,

01:18:11.937 --> 01:18:14.646
newly-born leaves, you see, pink ones.

01:18:40.855 --> 01:18:45.563
Yes, but they are the controller of the Nirmala Vidya;

01:18:47.563 --> 01:18:49.354
Shuddha Vidya – pure knowledge.

01:18:51.313 --> 01:18:56.771
These are, teeth are the manifestation –

01:18:57.605 --> 01:19:00.229
they manifest pure knowledge.

01:19:03.855 --> 01:19:08.062
It’s the primules of all the Vidyas. Primules.

01:19:37.895 --> 01:19:40.730
Camphor is to be applied. And betel is to be eaten,

01:19:41.021 --> 01:19:43.271
– which I don’t eat, you see.

01:20:16.855 --> 01:20:22.021
Sanlap means “auspicious.” Alap is the report, report.

01:20:25.396 --> 01:20:29.187
Report. So …. You see, to be very frank,

01:20:29.896 --> 01:20:31.187
it’s very embarrassing.

01:20:31.896 --> 01:20:33.855
You’d better read it. ….

01:20:51.146 --> 01:20:52.521
No, no, that’s what is written there:

01:20:52.979 --> 01:20:57.438
like the music of veena, divine music of veena. Saraswati.

01:23:33.021 --> 01:23:36.396
See, in a subtler form you must see all these things.

01:23:37.229 --> 01:23:40.396
You don’t see that, all the strains, you see.

01:23:41.146 --> 01:23:45.104
In a subtler form, diamonds are the things which radiate –

01:23:45.521 --> 01:23:47.271
they radiate, you see.

01:23:47.730 --> 01:23:52.187
So when they say the diamonds around the neck,

01:23:52.688 --> 01:23:55.313
it’s not question of wearing it outside;

01:23:55.771 --> 01:24:00.146
it’s a question of radiating that love.

01:24:00.730 --> 01:24:03.438
So the necklace, necklace is useful.

01:24:03.813 --> 01:24:05.438
But now, you are My diamonds in My necklace,

01:24:05.813 --> 01:24:09.021
so why should I wear any diamonds anymore?

01:24:15.021 --> 01:24:17.187
Cosmic, that’s it.

01:24:21.479 --> 01:24:25.895
You see, when She didn’t have Her own diamonds,

01:24:27.187 --> 01:24:30.229
and the one that She did have, She used to wear

01:24:30.646 --> 01:24:31.895
those diamonds, all right.

01:24:32.313 --> 01:24:36.062
But now you have living diamonds, so what’s the need?

01:24:36.813 --> 01:24:38.771
They were used to radiate Her power.

01:24:39.104 --> 01:24:40.146
Now you don’t need anything;

01:24:40.521 --> 01:24:43.521
you are the ones who are going to radiate the powers.

01:24:44.813 --> 01:24:47.730
Yogi: We are the ornaments of Mataji, that’s what we should

01:24:48.187 --> 01:24:50.688
understand and we should try to keep ourselves clean

01:24:51.104 --> 01:24:53.146
that we radiant maximum...

01:24:57.021 --> 01:24:59.104
Yogi: Self cleaning jewels.

01:24:59.104 --> 01:25:00.313
That’s it.

01:25:02.021 --> 01:25:04.187
All built-in!

01:26:00.895 --> 01:26:02.979
I think we’d better not translate it, better not.

01:26:04.396 --> 01:26:06.979
It is more about the breast of the Mother.

01:26:07.813 --> 01:26:09.855
Because the children are worried about the breast,

01:26:10.605 --> 01:26:13.313
so it’s described here, so it’s better not.

01:26:15.646 --> 01:26:17.354
No, no, no, better not.

01:26:25.229 --> 01:26:27.646
You see, this is written by, for people like Markandeya,

01:26:28.271 --> 01:26:30.062
and they described Mother in and out.

01:26:30.438 --> 01:26:32.313
I don’t know how they found the Mother like that, you see,

01:26:32.688 --> 01:26:34.438
because they are children.

01:26:35.146 --> 01:26:36.229
You see, so they were the children.

01:26:36.895 --> 01:26:38.855
So the children know everything about the Mother in and out,

01:26:39.479 --> 01:26:42.021
see, so described the whole birth.

01:27:32.937 --> 01:27:35.479
There are three folds.

01:27:36.479 --> 01:27:37.855
The Mother is ...three folds.

01:27:38.271 --> 01:27:40.021
That’s why it’s called as...

01:27:54.438 --> 01:27:56.271
Very embarrassing!

01:29:30.104 --> 01:29:31.896
Kamesha is...He’s the God of all the desires.

01:29:32.271 --> 01:29:35.563
“Kama” is “desire.” That’s why He’s placed in the Heart.

01:30:55.187 --> 01:30:59.396
Too much of an arch. Can’t wear modern shoes! ....

01:31:48.937 --> 01:31:53.605
They took a photograph – you were there –

01:31:54.271 --> 01:31:55.979
but one of the photographs where they just saw

01:31:56.354 --> 01:31:59.521
the flames coming out of My feet …. Maha Shivratri.

01:32:40.187 --> 01:32:43.396
You see, all this is being said because by saying

01:32:43.771 --> 01:32:45.979
these things you excite these powers,

01:32:46.396 --> 01:32:49.688
you see – they feel happy, they get excited.

01:32:50.104 --> 01:32:52.855
And it is nothing special for Me because if it is Mine,

01:32:53.187 --> 01:32:55.479
it’s nothing special. It’s just there.

01:32:55.937 --> 01:32:59.730
But one has to know that why you get Realization so fast,

01:33:00.187 --> 01:33:02.771
because must be something special about Me.

01:33:03.187 --> 01:33:04.813
Why you got Realization so quickly?

01:33:05.229 --> 01:33:08.438
I look like you, behave like you, everything is like you.

01:33:08.937 --> 01:33:11.937
But there’s something very subtle with it,

01:33:12.438 --> 01:33:14.354
which is very dynamic, and you must understand

01:33:15.146 --> 01:33:17.521
the cosmic nature of the Mother.

01:33:18.146 --> 01:33:20.396
That’s how it will explain how you all are getting

01:33:20.813 --> 01:33:23.896
Realization, how you are giving Realization to others.

01:33:24.646 --> 01:33:28.771
That’s why all these description are being given by the seers,

01:33:29.271 --> 01:33:31.438
who are of a very high quality people, you see.

01:33:31.855 --> 01:33:33.563
They are very subtler, but the subtler you grow,

01:33:33.979 --> 01:33:38.146
the more you understand My powers, and your own powers too.

01:33:38.979 --> 01:33:43.187
But it’s such a mutual understanding, you see;

01:33:43.688 --> 01:33:44.895
like the more you open your eyes,

01:33:45.313 --> 01:33:47.895
the more you see the sunlight. In the same way it is.

01:33:49.937 --> 01:33:51.895
But there must be something about Me,

01:33:52.354 --> 01:33:53.646
that you are getting Realization,

01:33:54.146 --> 01:33:57.396
and that something is this description.

01:33:59.521 --> 01:34:01.771
Yogi: They say that the Goddess is so great

01:34:02.229 --> 01:34:04.771
that even Lord Ganesha looks only at Her feet.

01:34:05.229 --> 01:34:08.187
He never looks up to see Her face.

01:34:08.730 --> 01:34:11.771
But not Sahaja yogis, are all right. They are excused.

01:34:12.229 --> 01:34:15.438
They are meant more than any other deities,

01:34:15.896 --> 01:34:17.396
and they are treated like that.

01:34:17.855 --> 01:34:20.313
First with children, you see, the deities also are very,

01:34:21.062 --> 01:34:24.062
very good, very, very kind.

01:34:24.605 --> 01:34:26.688
They know they are on the stage and they are

01:34:27.146 --> 01:34:30.730
to be looked after, and they are therefore My favorite ones.

01:34:32.479 --> 01:34:34.521
Yogi says there is another description that

01:34:35.104 --> 01:34:37.605
the Goddess’s toenails do not need to be cut,

01:34:38.271 --> 01:34:40.229
because they are clipped by the jewels

01:34:40.895 --> 01:34:43.771
of the deities’ crowns as they bow at Her feet.

01:34:49.646 --> 01:34:51.937
It’s true, I seldom do that.

01:34:52.813 --> 01:34:54.895
But sometimes I think I have to, because when you

01:34:55.354 --> 01:34:56.855
people come on My Feet –

01:34:57.187 --> 01:34:58.688
you are not Brahma, Vishnu, Maheshas –

01:34:59.187 --> 01:35:02.688
you should not get hurt.

01:35:02.937 --> 01:35:04.605
See, you don’t have any crowns!

01:35:20.396 --> 01:35:22.688
See, at the right time!

01:36:36.563 --> 01:36:38.396
Brighton married ladies.

01:38:03.521 --> 01:38:07.021
Yogi: Salutations to Her, whose Lord is within Her power.

01:38:07.979 --> 01:38:10.438
Hm. Just imagine!

01:38:11.855 --> 01:38:13.521
Yogi: The meaning of this is that one can only

01:38:14.187 --> 01:38:17.605
approach the Absolute through Mataji.

01:38:18.271 --> 01:38:23.438
That’s Her power. You see, even the, even the control

01:38:24.146 --> 01:38:28.438
of the Shiva, Sadashiva, is in the hands

01:38:28.813 --> 01:38:31.771
of the Mother is not true, to that extent.

01:38:32.229 --> 01:38:34.354
Yogi: But you are His, the manifestation of His power.

01:38:34.855 --> 01:38:38.313
It’s true; but you see, My love is,

01:38:38.730 --> 01:38:41.479
compassion is quite a lot, much more.

01:38:43.354 --> 01:38:45.187
I’m not wrathful.

01:38:45.730 --> 01:38:49.021
But if you people misbehave too much, then He’s wrathful.

01:38:49.521 --> 01:38:51.187
I may not be able to control.

01:38:51.605 --> 01:38:56.521
Then I have to witness the wrath of God.

01:38:58.896 --> 01:39:00.979
He’s compassion, He’s love, He’s innocence –

01:39:01.354 --> 01:39:04.979
everything is there, but He’s wrathful.

01:39:06.730 --> 01:39:09.021
So be careful what you want to do.

01:39:31.004 --> 01:39:36.962
You see, actually in subtle form it’s this.

01:39:39.212 --> 01:39:46.920
That thing which is Kailash, part of His domain.

01:39:47.837 --> 01:39:55.171
Kailash is a very big space, you see. Peak of …. Kailash.

01:39:58.296 --> 01:40:00.629
You must see the pictures of Kailash.

01:40:01.004 --> 01:40:05.713
It looks like a human face, absolutely – so wonderful.

01:40:06.129 --> 01:40:08.087
And three little heads, can you see?

01:40:08.087 --> 01:40:10.671
Absolutely clearly you can see this.

01:40:10.962 --> 01:40:14.754
And the vibrations are tremendous.

01:40:31.379 --> 01:40:34.629
And what about the day we had Shiva Puja?

01:40:35.045 --> 01:40:38.753
That day it was frozen completely.

01:41:07.962 --> 01:41:10.087
Heroine.

01:41:20.004 --> 01:41:24.504
Nayika is the commander, that’s correct. Shri Chakra:

01:41:24.837 --> 01:41:27.753
it’s the chakra with which the whole world is created,

01:41:28.045 --> 01:41:31.379
everything; creative chakra is Shri.

01:41:53.795 --> 01:41:56.754
Chintamani is the jewels which is,

01:41:59.337 --> 01:42:03.504
which emits the fulfilment of your desires.

01:42:04.171 --> 01:42:11.296
Whatever you desire, your worries, your desires are fulfilled

01:42:11.753 --> 01:42:15.754
by that jewel, called Chintamani.

01:42:21.753 --> 01:42:28.962
She is the one who fulfils all your desires. You must desire.

01:42:42.879 --> 01:42:50.379
Brahmas, five Brahmas. Five elements.

01:44:00.421 --> 01:44:01.254
Loudly.

01:44:44.045 --> 01:44:46.171
Vaibhava.

01:44:46.754 --> 01:44:50.546
Vaibhava, is the glory.

01:44:57.504 --> 01:45:00.296
… combines.

01:45:19.713 --> 01:45:20.754
Manatma.

01:45:24.045 --> 01:45:25.837
What is translated, read it.

01:45:25.837 --> 01:45:27.879
You see, this is because of samasas;

01:45:28.337 --> 01:45:30.713
Vigraha is not correct, that’s why.

01:45:31.004 --> 01:45:33.588
Now you read the …

01:45:38.171 --> 01:45:40.671
Atmanas.

01:45:41.588 --> 01:45:43.129
Manatmanas:

01:45:43.463 --> 01:45:45.795
the ones whose minds have become atmas.

01:45:46.254 --> 01:45:48.087
Manatmanas.

01:46:03.588 --> 01:46:05.588
See, they are Her dignity – that’s the point.

01:46:06.129 --> 01:46:09.837
That’s Her vaibhav. Vaibhav means, we can say,

01:46:12.504 --> 01:46:16.546
the majestic pulsation She emitted.

01:46:16.546 --> 01:46:20.671
Something – vaibhava can be, bangles can be My vaibhav,

01:46:21.296 --> 01:46:24.754
means they’re ornaments which add to Her majesty.

01:46:25.588 --> 01:46:27.254
Vaibhav, you see.

01:46:30.004 --> 01:46:32.379
Rishis are My vaibhavas, see;

01:46:32.753 --> 01:46:37.421
now what I’ve told you is true. You’re My vaibhavas.

01:46:44.588 --> 01:46:47.463
This Bandhasur, this what’s-his-name is –

01:46:48.713 --> 01:46:52.171
was yesterday that lady was entangled by him …

01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:55.671
Muktananda – is Bandhasur.

01:46:57.087 --> 01:46:58.837
Yogi: The asura who ties you up.

01:46:59.212 --> 01:47:01.671
Very difficult to get rid of these people.

01:47:02.045 --> 01:47:06.171
Muktananda, see is the one who makes you absolutely

01:47:06.463 --> 01:47:09.546
bound to him – and he says, “Have muktananda.”

01:47:16.129 --> 01:47:18.795
This lady is down with tuberculosis,

01:47:19.129 --> 01:47:21.171
but she can’t give him up, you see.

01:47:21.171 --> 01:47:22.754
She has both the hearts catching very badly,

01:47:22.754 --> 01:47:24.713
she’s going down, and she can’t give up

01:47:25.004 --> 01:47:26.795
because he’s tied him – he’s Bandhasura.

01:47:27.087 --> 01:47:29.004
But Bandhasura has this quality:

01:47:29.004 --> 01:47:31.004
you have to tie up people, you see,

01:47:31.337 --> 01:47:35.045
and even if they are dying they cannot leave.

01:48:09.504 --> 01:48:11.837
Sampatkari.

01:48:16.546 --> 01:48:23.629
Sampati means “property” and is represented by elephant.

01:48:38.795 --> 01:48:40.379
This is the main point.

01:48:40.962 --> 01:48:45.296
See, ashwakoti – crores of ashwas.

01:48:46.421 --> 01:48:52.671
Ashwa means horses; so, white horses – crores of them.

01:49:03.754 --> 01:49:06.421
Do you know that?

01:49:08.421 --> 01:49:10.671
Ashwarudha.

01:49:11.004 --> 01:49:14.463
The ones who are on the horses, white horses,

01:49:14.879 --> 01:49:17.795
are representative of the Shakti, of the Power,

01:49:18.588 --> 01:49:23.463
and they are the ones who are part of the Kalaki.

01:49:24.837 --> 01:49:31.546
Crores of them, crores. “Crores” means ten million – one.

01:50:16.296 --> 01:50:19.045
She’s the action; action chakra is Shri Chakra,

01:50:19.504 --> 01:50:20.920
through which one acts.

01:50:21.212 --> 01:50:23.754
It’s the right side, Shri Chakra.

01:50:29.379 --> 01:50:32.671
Geya chakra. “Geya” means “by which you know.”

01:50:32.671 --> 01:50:34.920
Geya is the, by which you know.

01:50:35.171 --> 01:50:39.296
She is the one who is in possession of that center

01:50:39.546 --> 01:50:41.753
by which you know.

01:50:43.296 --> 01:50:46.754
Knowledge is that chakra only.

01:50:58.171 --> 01:51:00.795
Those who are served are the mantrinis.

01:51:01.254 --> 01:51:03.629
You have – your mantras are enlightened mantras.

01:51:04.045 --> 01:51:06.920
Whatever you say is mantra.

01:51:29.337 --> 01:51:36.463
Kiri? Kri, kri. Yes, that becomes “Sa”.

01:51:36.754 --> 01:51:40.713
Kri is Karochita, is Shri Chakra only.

01:52:09.671 --> 01:52:12.795
So Sahaja yogis must be careful, you see, also.

01:52:16.504 --> 01:52:19.045
A little bit frightening.

01:52:28.546 --> 01:52:30.463
Madhyaga.

01:52:47.421 --> 01:52:51.629
Blazing garland – Jwalamalini.

01:53:05.045 --> 01:53:07.920
Jwalamalini is...

01:53:24.004 --> 01:53:26.546
Horrible Bandhasur.

01:53:58.754 --> 01:54:00.962
What is the valor of Nitya?

01:54:00.962 --> 01:54:03.129
Is crucifixion of Christ.

01:54:04.379 --> 01:54:06.920
It’s the valor of Nitya, because He’s eternal Being,

01:54:07.837 --> 01:54:09.296
so you can see Him crucified; otherwise

01:54:09.588 --> 01:54:12.337
for a Mother to see Her Child crucified is horrific.

01:54:13.087 --> 01:54:15.629
But because He’s the valor of Nitya,

01:54:15.629 --> 01:54:19.671
that’s the valor of Nitya – the valor of eternity.

01:54:20.045 --> 01:54:21.753
You see the valor of eternity,

01:54:21.962 --> 01:54:25.504
how He is killed actually, and He resurrected.

01:54:25.504 --> 01:54:28.962
But when you see that valor, it is so beautiful.

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:31.421
Yogi: We must know that the same thing is in us.

01:54:31.421 --> 01:54:34.379
Yes, of course.

01:54:55.671 --> 01:55:00.879
Bala is Kartikeya. It’s Kartikeya.

01:55:01.588 --> 01:55:04.254
And He kills, because at this point the Kartikeya

01:55:04.588 --> 01:55:07.588
works out, you see – at this point.

01:55:07.588 --> 01:55:11.962
And this is one, this horrible fellow Bandhasur, creates your

01:55:25.212 --> 01:55:28.254
Was terrible lady, that night!

01:55:30.546 --> 01:55:33.004
Is there not going to be … now.

01:55:36.045 --> 01:55:39.254
Now it’s done or not? It’s done now.

01:56:00.754 --> 01:56:02.753
I gave it to Pamela.

01:56:04.087 --> 01:56:07.879
Pamela, where are those ornaments I gave you?

01:56:44.087 --> 01:56:49.254
Where is that? … Yes, where is it?

01:56:54.504 --> 01:56:57.004
Both things are there.

01:58:42.671 --> 01:58:44.504
Karanguli.

01:58:46.337 --> 01:58:47.713
From Her …

01:58:51.754 --> 01:58:53.754
...fingernails. Karanguli.

01:58:53.754 --> 01:58:56.129
Anguli is “fingers.”

01:59:23.713 --> 01:59:27.087
Pashupati’s Shiva, and She’s Mahapashupati.

02:00:11.254 --> 02:00:18.171
Burning the cities, is just like Rajneesh’s city was burnt.

02:02:15.962 --> 02:02:20.045
Madhyakuta. Middle part.

02:03:46.171 --> 02:03:57.754
Kula is, you can say, it’s a dynasty, dynasty; house, house.

02:04:03.504 --> 02:04:07.337
Yogi: Mataji’s kula is all the Sahaja yogis.

02:04:07.754 --> 02:04:10.837
Of course …

02:04:22.713 --> 02:04:26.129
See, it’s very delicate.

02:04:27.171 --> 02:04:33.629
See, what are the symbols of, say -

02:04:36.629 --> 02:04:40.045
now, Gavin has given Me a little crown

02:04:41.920 --> 02:04:45.337
as a symbol of England, you see,

02:04:45.337 --> 02:04:47.753
which I really look after very much, you see –

02:04:48.004 --> 02:04:50.671
kept it very carefully.

02:05:04.504 --> 02:05:07.795
Also Kulangana is a word used for a lady

02:05:08.254 --> 02:05:15.171
who cares for the kula, means for the house,

02:05:15.171 --> 02:05:18.212
for the dignity of the house, dignity of the family,

02:05:18.795 --> 02:05:20.212
of all the dignity.

02:05:20.504 --> 02:05:23.962
She cares for the dignity of all the members of her family.

02:05:24.296 --> 02:05:27.171
To her, the dignity of her family

02:05:27.171 --> 02:05:28.504
is the most important thing.

02:05:40.004 --> 02:05:42.004
She enjoys that.

02:05:57.753 --> 02:06:00.171
There’s another word is kaul.

02:06:00.588 --> 02:06:05.546
Kaul is this thing where they ask whether it is correct

02:06:05.837 --> 02:06:08.671
or not for the kula, that is;

02:06:08.962 --> 02:06:11.504
and if the flower falls on this side or that side,

02:06:11.754 --> 02:06:13.753
they say, “Yes, kaul, yes, yes.

02:06:13.753 --> 02:06:15.879
The Goddess has said yes to me.”

02:06:15.879 --> 02:06:19.879
So Kaulini: She’s the one who is the,

02:06:20.337 --> 02:06:24.004
of course the mistress of the kula;

02:06:24.254 --> 02:06:28.463
but She’s the one who gives you yes and no,

02:06:28.713 --> 02:06:32.254
the indications which way to go.

02:06:54.546 --> 02:07:00.754
Akula. Akula means “the one who is beyond any disturbance.”

02:07:03.754 --> 02:07:08.671
Kula also mean “banks of the river” – kula,

02:07:08.920 --> 02:07:13.337
so also can mean “the one who has no banks.”

02:07:23.879 --> 02:07:26.504
Samaya means “time.”

02:07:26.795 --> 02:07:29.629
She’s the one who knows the time when to start puja,

02:07:30.504 --> 02:07:33.962
when to do what, She knows, She knows the timing,

02:07:34.212 --> 02:07:36.837
because She is inside the time.

02:07:43.754 --> 02:07:45.879
This is very important.

02:07:47.546 --> 02:07:48.795
What is it?

02:07:51.337 --> 02:07:54.337
Samayachaara, samayachaar means whatever is to be done

02:07:54.671 --> 02:07:56.337
in a particular time.

02:07:56.337 --> 02:08:01.463
For example now in modern times, see, that particular,

02:08:01.753 --> 02:08:04.379
that whatever is to be done,

02:08:04.753 --> 02:08:07.962
auspicious thing for modern times, one should do.

02:08:08.837 --> 02:08:12.629
For example, learning English is important for us.

02:08:13.045 --> 02:08:17.671
But apart from that, samayachaar means mannerism

02:08:17.962 --> 02:08:21.421
of a particular time, you see, certain mannerism

02:08:21.754 --> 02:08:23.546
of a particular time which is good,

02:08:23.837 --> 02:08:25.837
auspicious, must be done:

02:08:26.129 --> 02:08:29.212
like putting the belt, see, while sitting in the car

02:08:29.463 --> 02:08:32.879
you must put the belt – samayachaar, whatever it is.

02:08:33.129 --> 02:08:35.879
You see, for Devi it is not necessary.

02:08:35.879 --> 02:08:38.920
For example, if you give Me some money,

02:08:38.920 --> 02:08:41.045
I need not put it in the bank.

02:08:41.045 --> 02:08:43.754
I can lose all that up and say that I’ve finished –

02:08:44.087 --> 02:08:45.463
there’s no sin for Me.

02:08:45.754 --> 02:08:47.588
I can take away all your properties,

02:08:47.795 --> 02:08:49.754
everything, there’s no sin.

02:08:50.045 --> 02:08:52.713
But I must do according to the time,

02:08:52.920 --> 02:08:54.795
to prove what is good for you,

02:08:55.171 --> 02:08:58.920
how you should behave towards money,

02:08:59.296 --> 02:09:02.629
towards collectivity; and accordingly I behave.

02:09:02.629 --> 02:09:04.254
And there is no need for Me,

02:09:04.254 --> 02:09:07.129
because I am beyond it, isn’t it?

02:09:07.379 --> 02:09:09.629
But samaya, whatever is necessary for

02:09:09.879 --> 02:09:12.379
according to the time, I have to do.

02:09:14.129 --> 02:09:15.920
And that’s what you should understand.

02:09:16.171 --> 02:09:18.254
Not to be abnormal people, you see,

02:09:18.254 --> 02:09:20.379
behaving in an abnormal way.

02:09:20.837 --> 02:09:24.171
Even I tell you that you need not put on this red thing,

02:09:24.504 --> 02:09:26.962
because it may not be samaya kul at this time,

02:09:27.296 --> 02:09:28.754
you see – people won’t understand,

02:09:29.087 --> 02:09:31.879
so you need not put.

02:09:34.879 --> 02:09:39.004
It is wisdom to behave in a way that you lead normal,

02:09:39.254 --> 02:09:43.212
you behave in a normal way, do something that is normal.

02:09:46.588 --> 02:09:48.629
But God need not.

02:09:48.920 --> 02:09:51.753
For God it is not necessary because He’s beyond,

02:09:51.962 --> 02:09:58.504
but when you have disciples who have to come up,

02:09:58.753 --> 02:10:00.671
who have to deal with other people,

02:10:01.045 --> 02:10:04.629
they must know how to behave.

02:10:04.837 --> 02:10:08.671
Like to say thank you is not necessary for Me to you, at all.

02:10:08.671 --> 02:10:10.296
If you give Me a glass of water

02:10:10.546 --> 02:10:12.129
it’s a privilege to you, all right?

02:10:12.421 --> 02:10:13.879
But I say thank you ten times,

02:10:13.879 --> 02:10:16.379
because you must also say thank you.

02:10:19.879 --> 02:10:22.920
Samaya kul, samaya kul.

02:10:26.129 --> 02:10:28.254
Yogi: Salutations to Her as the only one

02:10:28.254 --> 02:10:30.379
who lives in the Mooladhara.

02:10:34.379 --> 02:10:38.045
Nobody can enter in.

02:10:40.337 --> 02:10:42.087
Brahma granthi.

02:11:01.171 --> 02:11:05.045
See, you can’t enter inside the center unless

02:11:05.379 --> 02:11:07.379
and until your Kundalini rises,

02:11:07.629 --> 02:11:11.212
and the Kundalini is the representation of Holy Ghost.

02:11:11.463 --> 02:11:14.463
And She’s the only one which can enter into it.

02:11:14.463 --> 02:11:17.837
And also She resides, the Devi resides there

02:11:17.837 --> 02:11:22.337
as Mahalakshmi or as Lakshmi, in Manipura.

02:11:41.463 --> 02:11:43.588
Now see, without coming to Sahaja Yoga

02:11:44.254 --> 02:11:46.795
you would not understand all these things, isn’t it?

02:11:47.045 --> 02:11:48.795
Because it’s not known to you that

02:11:48.795 --> 02:11:50.546
there are granthis within us,

02:11:50.546 --> 02:11:52.629
there are centers within us, that these centers

02:11:52.629 --> 02:11:55.671
are to be broken, then there’s granthis are formed

02:11:55.879 --> 02:11:59.045
between the centers – all this knowledge is impossible.

02:11:59.296 --> 02:12:01.337
If you are not realized what’s the use of talking

02:12:01.337 --> 02:12:03.962
about it to you, because you cannot see that.

02:12:03.962 --> 02:12:06.129
But in a person you can see it,

02:12:06.129 --> 02:12:08.588
that at a certain point you find it is between

02:12:08.588 --> 02:12:11.754
two centers this Kundalini stops, you see.

02:12:11.754 --> 02:12:15.337
There is the center, say, of Manipura and Swadhisthana,

02:12:15.337 --> 02:12:17.920
in between the two the Kundalini stops.

02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:19.171
Now what is that?

02:12:19.171 --> 02:12:21.212
That is the granthi of Vishnu,

02:12:21.463 --> 02:12:23.463
so that’s the Vishnugranthi vibhedini.

02:12:23.463 --> 02:12:26.087
If you say the mantra of “Vishnugranthi vibhedini”,

02:12:26.421 --> 02:12:28.129
then only the Kundalini will rise.

02:12:28.421 --> 02:12:29.879
But before Realization,

02:12:29.879 --> 02:12:32.254
before the movement of the Kundalini, it is what?

02:12:32.504 --> 02:12:36.004
It is just talk, it has no sense at all.

02:12:48.546 --> 02:12:50.879
Here, at the Agnya Chakra.

02:12:54.212 --> 02:12:57.379
Antaral. Antaral means the innermost core.

02:12:58.629 --> 02:13:00.879
Antaral – in the innermost core of Agnya Chakra

02:13:01.296 --> 02:13:05.045
She resides. Rudra.

02:13:18.045 --> 02:13:22.962
“Sahasraram bhuja” means in the lotus of the Sahasrara,

02:13:24.337 --> 02:13:27.713
aarudh – She is bestowed upon that.

02:13:29.087 --> 02:13:31.713
Ascend – aarudh. All right.

02:13:32.129 --> 02:13:35.129
Actually when you go onto a throne or

02:13:35.379 --> 02:13:39.795
onto a horse is what you call mounted:

02:13:40.588 --> 02:13:44.129
She is mounted upon, She is mounted upon – aarudh.

02:14:55.045 --> 02:14:58.254
Yogi: Salutations to Her who is slender as a lotus stalk.

02:15:00.045 --> 02:15:02.920
That mean you should not be harsh with Me.

02:15:16.337 --> 02:15:20.588
Bhavani. “Bhava” means “to manifest.”

02:15:20.588 --> 02:15:24.129
Whatever is manifested. Known.

02:15:35.171 --> 02:15:36.795
You must have feeling.

02:15:37.045 --> 02:15:39.795
If you don’t have feelings for Me, you won’t know Me.

02:15:39.795 --> 02:15:41.463
Rationally you will not know.

02:15:41.463 --> 02:15:42.463
Those people who tried to know Me rationally

02:15:42.713 --> 02:15:44.045
can never know Me.

02:15:44.045 --> 02:15:45.837
You have to have feelings.

02:15:57.546 --> 02:15:59.129
Forest of …?

02:16:05.920 --> 02:16:07.504
You see, if you have to become,

02:16:07.795 --> 02:16:10.713
there’s a big mesh on, and She’s the one

02:16:10.713 --> 02:16:15.296
who cuts that and makes you the spirit.

02:16:19.713 --> 02:16:21.920
See, whatever is manifested is created,

02:16:22.254 --> 02:16:25.212
is nothing but a forest, isn’t it,

02:16:25.504 --> 02:16:27.671
and She takes you beyond that.

02:16:34.463 --> 02:16:37.254
“Bhadra” means actually “gentlemanly”, see?

02:16:38.004 --> 02:16:40.004
She likes people who are gentlemanly.

02:16:40.004 --> 02:16:42.004
She doesn’t like arrogant people,

02:16:42.379 --> 02:16:45.337
people who have no sense how to behave,

02:16:46.045 --> 02:16:51.296
ill-mannered sort of people She doesn’t like, you see –

02:16:51.629 --> 02:16:57.879
except for Shiva, who is His own style, you see.

02:17:00.962 --> 02:17:04.754
He’s very kind, but He’s so innocent, He’s so sweet.

02:17:07.337 --> 02:17:12.337
Imagine, He comes on a bull – He’s not very bhadra!

02:17:13.879 --> 02:17:19.337
Not very gentlemanly to come on a bull, isn’t it!

02:17:27.504 --> 02:17:34.671
I mean, She’s a lady. She’s ladylike, you can say.

02:17:41.546 --> 02:17:43.753
Yogi: Salutations to Her who gives

02:17:44.087 --> 02:17:46.254
all good things to Her bhaktas.

02:17:46.546 --> 02:17:48.546
All good things, not bad things –

02:17:48.795 --> 02:17:51.337
supposing you ask for a whisky, I will not!

02:18:00.713 --> 02:18:02.920
Yogi: Salutations to Her who loves Her devotees.

02:18:03.504 --> 02:18:08.045
Definitely. You must know this in your hearts,

02:18:08.296 --> 02:18:11.045
that I love all of you very much, all right?

02:18:11.296 --> 02:18:13.212
So you won’t be diffident at all.

02:18:13.212 --> 02:18:15.087
I love you, every one of you,

02:18:15.421 --> 02:18:18.171
much more than you love Me.

02:18:19.171 --> 02:18:21.421
So that you love yourself and each other.

02:18:24.879 --> 02:18:27.004
Yogi: Salutations to Her who can be approached

02:18:27.004 --> 02:18:29.129
only through devotion.

02:18:29.463 --> 02:18:31.588
Through devotion.

02:18:38.504 --> 02:18:42.171
You can only control Me through bhakti.

02:19:24.129 --> 02:19:27.588
Sharada is Saraswati.

02:20:42.504 --> 02:20:44.379
Shatodari doesn’t mean that.

02:20:45.421 --> 02:20:49.546
Shatodari. Shat means hundred.

02:20:49.837 --> 02:20:55.337
She has hundred, hundred – udara means stomachs,

02:20:55.588 --> 02:20:58.087
see, udara means the wombs.

02:20:58.337 --> 02:20:59.879
She has hundreds of wombs.

02:21:00.129 --> 02:21:02.754
Otherwise how will I do the work?

02:22:00.337 --> 02:22:03.004
… is going to make Me red!

02:22:13.713 --> 02:22:15.629
Should be also unruffled type.

02:22:16.421 --> 02:22:17.795
There’s nothing to be ruffled,

02:22:17.795 --> 02:22:20.045
it’s all a joke going on.

02:22:27.962 --> 02:22:31.546
That means completely integrated personality.

02:22:41.795 --> 02:22:44.254
Yogi: Salutations to Her who is beyond desire.

02:22:45.129 --> 02:22:47.588
That’s why I say you must desire.

02:23:27.296 --> 02:23:29.962
She’s purposeless, you see, purposeless.

02:23:30.296 --> 02:23:32.629
This Prapancha means “purposeless”, you see.

02:23:32.837 --> 02:23:35.588
All the elements are the ones which create the purpose.

02:23:35.962 --> 02:23:38.713
If the elements are not there, there’s no purpose.

02:23:49.588 --> 02:23:52.045
I mean, if you become abode of everyone,

02:23:52.379 --> 02:23:54.753
how can you have abode?

02:23:55.129 --> 02:23:56.920
If you become the support of everyone,

02:23:57.421 --> 02:24:00.129
how can you have any support?

02:24:00.379 --> 02:24:02.671
Imagine the situation!

02:24:55.379 --> 02:24:58.004
Nirupadhi.… upadhi means there’s no upadhi.

02:25:00.588 --> 02:25:05.045
Means, see, additions, an addition, you see.

02:25:06.379 --> 02:25:09.753
A upadhi is, you see, like they say

02:25:09.753 --> 02:25:14.087
“Sir this and this”, “Lady this and this” – you see,

02:25:14.087 --> 02:25:16.254
these are all upadhis.

02:25:16.504 --> 02:25:18.296
This is additions; which, if you are complete,

02:25:18.546 --> 02:25:22.296
you don’t need this thing – attributes.

02:25:48.504 --> 02:25:52.254
I mean, if you have passions, how can you destroy passions?

02:25:55.045 --> 02:25:56.795
But it’s so natural, you know.

02:25:56.795 --> 02:25:59.045
There’s nothing special.

02:26:00.920 --> 02:26:02.920
Nothing special about a person

02:26:03.421 --> 02:26:06.212
who didn’t take to these passions.

02:26:18.754 --> 02:26:20.671
Naturally.

02:27:02.754 --> 02:27:04.546
These are called as dual names, you see:

02:27:05.087 --> 02:27:07.379
that the first they give the quality,

02:27:08.087 --> 02:27:10.795
and then what does that quality do.

02:27:11.045 --> 02:27:13.713
Say, if they say “Nirmama” it’s a person

02:27:13.713 --> 02:27:16.045
who doesn’t say “this is mine,” who doesn’t feel

02:27:16.379 --> 02:27:18.045
“this is mine, this is mine.”

02:27:18.045 --> 02:27:20.920
Such is the person only –that’s the quality.

02:27:21.171 --> 02:27:24.920
Nirmama quality itself destroys this attachment in you

02:27:25.171 --> 02:27:28.629
when you say “this is mine, this is mine, this is mine.”

02:27:31.337 --> 02:27:34.546
You see, like a soap has the quality to cleanse,

02:27:34.546 --> 02:27:35.337
all right?

02:27:35.337 --> 02:27:38.753
The soap has to cleanse, now nobody cleanses the soap.

02:27:42.004 --> 02:27:44.171
That’s how it is.

02:28:23.296 --> 02:28:25.837
Yogi: Salutations to Her who has no doubt.

02:28:26.671 --> 02:28:29.087
About anything.

02:28:38.045 --> 02:28:40.379
See, this is what it is.

02:28:40.379 --> 02:28:43.379
If I had doubt then you would be doubtful also.

02:28:43.753 --> 02:28:46.171
But you know Mother has no doubts about things,

02:28:46.504 --> 02:28:49.171
so when you come near Me your doubts also vanish,

02:28:49.421 --> 02:28:51.546
automatically.

02:29:03.337 --> 02:29:08.254
That’s it … Very good …

02:29:18.629 --> 02:29:21.254
“Bhava” means whatever is manifested.

02:29:21.713 --> 02:29:25.795
You see, whatever is manifested is bhava;

02:29:26.713 --> 02:29:28.837
and whatever is manifested is this flesh,

02:29:29.087 --> 02:29:30.837
this body, this everything, see.

02:29:31.087 --> 02:29:36.087
So you just get above it, that you deny it –

02:29:37.504 --> 02:29:40.337
the denial of the flesh, as Christ has said.

02:29:40.753 --> 02:29:43.754
So Bhavanashini means the one who takes you away

02:29:44.087 --> 02:29:47.254
from this world of illusions, the world of manifestation,

02:29:47.254 --> 02:29:50.879
in which you think “Now this house is mine, that is mine.”

02:29:51.129 --> 02:29:52.879
All these ideas go away,

02:29:53.129 --> 02:29:54.920
and you become one with the Reality.

02:30:05.837 --> 02:30:08.546
Yogi: Salutations to Her who has no plans,

02:30:08.546 --> 02:30:10.171
no mental acitivities.

02:30:13.045 --> 02:30:15.629
Not at all. But what to do?

02:30:15.629 --> 02:30:18.629
The mental activity I don’t understand.

02:30:18.629 --> 02:30:21.962
I sometimes say “I think” because of samayacha,

02:30:22.379 --> 02:30:24.629
you see; but to be very frank, I never think.

02:30:24.920 --> 02:30:27.337
I don’t know how to think.

02:30:28.837 --> 02:30:30.837
It’s impossible.

02:30:31.795 --> 02:30:33.504
It’s a funny machine, you know.

02:30:35.379 --> 02:30:38.795
That’s why for you I have more respect and concern,

02:30:39.171 --> 02:30:40.962
because whatever I have I have,

02:30:40.962 --> 02:30:42.879
it’s nothing so special, you see?

02:30:42.879 --> 02:30:44.629
But you are achieving it,

02:30:44.837 --> 02:30:47.004
so it’s something special about you.

02:30:47.296 --> 02:30:49.588
If you have everything, what is so great?

02:30:49.879 --> 02:30:51.754
If somebody is achieving it, it’s a greater thing,

02:30:52.129 --> 02:30:54.337
much, much greater.

02:31:00.379 --> 02:31:02.045
That’s all right.

02:31:02.379 --> 02:31:03.920
But for that I cannot take any credit,

02:31:04.171 --> 02:31:05.920
because it’s automatic people take it.

02:31:06.379 --> 02:31:08.171
I don’t know how to take the credit, you see.

02:31:08.504 --> 02:31:11.379
That capacity is also not there, you see,

02:31:11.379 --> 02:31:14.795
to take the credit. I’ve tried, but I can’t!

02:31:18.212 --> 02:31:20.087
I never feel, you see,

02:31:20.546 --> 02:31:23.463
that a very credible about it that

02:31:23.463 --> 02:31:24.920
I should take a credit,

02:31:25.337 --> 02:31:27.379
and come and “this is My doing.”

02:31:27.379 --> 02:31:28.713
I just don’t feel it that way,

02:31:29.129 --> 02:31:30.463
I don’t know how to feel – I mean,

02:31:30.753 --> 02:31:33.837
there’s something’s missing in the personality.

02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:38.920
The ignorance is missing. All right?

02:31:57.962 --> 02:31:59.254
Now this is the integration,

02:31:59.546 --> 02:32:00.920
and non-integrated, you see.

02:32:01.254 --> 02:32:04.629
When you are integrated there’s no problem, about it:

02:32:04.920 --> 02:32:07.296
you are integrated.

02:32:07.296 --> 02:32:11.421
So whatever your body is – it will eat what is good,

02:32:11.795 --> 02:32:14.254
everything is integrated; no problem,

02:32:14.504 --> 02:32:16.254
there’s no quarrel about it.

02:32:16.254 --> 02:32:18.421
Within yourself you are at peace.

02:32:18.671 --> 02:32:19.837
Let others do what they like,

02:32:20.087 --> 02:32:22.421
whatever they think about themselves doesn’t matter.

02:32:22.421 --> 02:32:24.296
But as far as you are concerned,

02:32:24.296 --> 02:32:26.920
you have no problem because you are so integrated

02:32:26.920 --> 02:32:29.504
and supported: there’s no left Vishuddhi

02:32:29.754 --> 02:32:31.296
feeling-guilty business.

02:32:31.296 --> 02:32:33.671
I don’t feel guilty for anything at all, you see.

02:32:33.671 --> 02:32:36.129
If I scold somebody – all right,

02:32:36.129 --> 02:32:38.588
I had to scold, I’ve scolded, finished.

02:32:38.962 --> 02:32:42.254
I don’t sit down and start feeling my left Vishuddhi.

02:32:44.212 --> 02:32:46.004
I am completely integrated.

02:32:46.753 --> 02:32:49.588
Whether I am in peace or in turmoil,

02:32:49.795 --> 02:32:51.254
or in anger turmoil I’m never –

02:32:51.713 --> 02:32:54.129
but I deliberately take anger upon Myself.

02:32:54.379 --> 02:32:55.879
Because it is deliberate, what is there

02:32:56.212 --> 02:32:58.254
to feel bad about it?

02:33:00.379 --> 02:33:02.546
Because you get, you see, blown into it:

02:33:02.754 --> 02:33:05.045
that’s why you feel bad, “Oh, why I did it?”

02:33:05.045 --> 02:33:07.296
But this I do it deliberately.

02:33:07.546 --> 02:33:10.421
Then what is there to feel bad?

02:33:12.212 --> 02:33:14.879
Yes, yes, of course. I do.

02:33:29.713 --> 02:33:32.296
Yogi: Salutations to Her who destroys death.

02:33:33.129 --> 02:33:37.504
The other day I used the mantra of Mrutunjaya.

02:33:37.504 --> 02:33:39.171
Did you hear that?

02:33:39.504 --> 02:33:42.629
That is should be used for people who are possessed

02:33:42.837 --> 02:33:47.296
by sort of a cemetery business, see.

02:33:47.753 --> 02:33:51.004
So imagine a complete cemetery possesses a man;

02:33:51.421 --> 02:33:54.087
then what to say?

02:33:54.463 --> 02:33:56.671
It’s Mrutunjaya:

02:33:56.879 --> 02:34:02.129
that “You are victorious over the death.”

02:34:12.045 --> 02:34:13.920
That’s what I said.

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:18.212
I don’t do anything, I am lazy person.

02:34:25.212 --> 02:34:27.546
Yogi: Salutations to Her who takes nothing.

02:34:28.004 --> 02:34:29.754
Yes, who takes nothing.

02:34:30.004 --> 02:34:33.129
Really, to be very frank I cannot take, you see –

02:34:33.129 --> 02:34:34.879
that doesn’t work out.

02:34:34.879 --> 02:34:37.671
You see, whatever comes to Me goes with a double speed.

02:35:45.629 --> 02:35:48.254
You know who is Durga?

02:35:48.753 --> 02:35:54.837
Durga is the one who is that fellow who did anand marg.

02:36:08.713 --> 02:36:11.504
All right, now give some rice on top.

02:36:14.629 --> 02:36:15.254
This is what it is.

02:36:15.254 --> 02:36:19.379
Now if I take this, it will blossom into thousands.

02:36:19.671 --> 02:36:21.588
Take where?

02:36:29.296 --> 02:36:30.795
And you see, what is this ritual?

02:36:30.795 --> 02:36:34.379
What does that mean – (that’s all) – what does that mean?

02:36:41.754 --> 02:36:44.962
Now this is the expression when you do like that,

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:48.546
is that now we have, making this auspicious,

02:36:54.546 --> 02:36:57.753
with this rice

02:37:00.588 --> 02:37:04.753
and what you’re calling, turmeric.

02:37:05.004 --> 02:37:08.254
Now the turmeric is a very special thing

02:37:08.504 --> 02:37:11.795
which is very auspicious, created by Mother Earth.

02:37:12.212 --> 02:37:12.962
Is a very auspicious thing.

02:37:14.129 --> 02:37:16.504
You cannot say why – it is.

02:37:18.254 --> 02:37:24.254
So mix it up with rice – rice is also a favorite

02:37:24.254 --> 02:37:29.171
of Mother – and make it auspicious with your hands.

02:37:29.629 --> 02:37:32.171
You have put it there, by which you say that

02:37:32.171 --> 02:37:35.546
“Mother, this we give it to You.”

02:37:35.754 --> 02:37:39.753
But actually, to put this akshatas – akshata;

02:37:39.962 --> 02:37:42.296
akshata means “this cannot be destroyed.”

02:37:43.546 --> 02:37:46.087
So while doing this what you are suggesting,

02:37:46.337 --> 02:37:50.087
that “Let us detach ourselves from these fruits,

02:37:50.337 --> 02:37:52.713
which we are giving to our Mother.”

02:37:52.713 --> 02:37:55.045
All right? The detachment.

02:37:55.337 --> 02:37:57.588
By that detachment, you develop a detachment

02:37:57.920 --> 02:37:58.713
within yourself.

02:37:58.713 --> 02:38:01.546
It’s a simple thing. That is, to give something

02:38:01.754 --> 02:38:05.463
to Mother is something not needed;

02:38:06.421 --> 02:38:08.004
but when you give it,

02:38:08.296 --> 02:38:11.087
by that you develop a detachment.

02:38:12.713 --> 02:38:14.588
That’s why you have to give:

02:38:15.129 --> 02:38:17.504
you develop a detachment from that.

02:38:17.504 --> 02:38:20.795
Of course you get it back, hundred times more back,

02:38:21.379 --> 02:38:26.129
but that detachment is developed within your heart;

02:38:26.713 --> 02:38:29.588
and even if you get thousandfold more,

02:38:29.588 --> 02:38:32.296
you are not attached to it. See?

02:38:32.920 --> 02:38:36.087
Then you become generous, you start giving to others.

02:38:36.379 --> 02:38:39.045
And when you are blessed by the same type of fruits,

02:38:39.045 --> 02:38:43.671
you don’t enjoy it alone, you only enjoyed it with others.

02:38:44.337 --> 02:38:47.421
You see, human beings have a capacity to enjoy everything

02:38:47.879 --> 02:38:50.004
all alone.

02:38:50.004 --> 02:38:51.671
They can sit down in a room,

02:38:51.671 --> 02:38:55.212
close the door and peel out a fruit and eat, themselves.

02:38:55.212 --> 02:38:58.463
I mean, they can do it, quite capable.

02:38:58.713 --> 02:39:01.379
Even the crows cannot do it, the animals can’t do it,

02:39:01.379 --> 02:39:04.629
but human beings have a capacity: they can do it.

02:39:04.920 --> 02:39:07.629
I don’t know how – it’s an impossible situation for Me,

02:39:07.837 --> 02:39:09.629
impossible.

02:39:09.629 --> 02:39:12.920
Even to eat food sitting alone is an impossible situation.

02:39:12.920 --> 02:39:17.837
But to sit down and enjoy yourself alone is possible.

02:39:17.837 --> 02:39:20.212
But by doing this, what you are saying:

02:39:20.504 --> 02:39:22.837
that we make it auspicious, give it to Mother.

02:39:25.212 --> 02:39:29.337
By that, you develop a detachment that

02:39:29.588 --> 02:39:31.463
whenever you will eat these fruits,

02:39:31.713 --> 02:39:33.045
always shared with others,

02:39:33.379 --> 02:39:35.753
and they’ll be bountiful, bountiful:

02:39:35.753 --> 02:39:39.171
meaning when you have more, give it to others.

02:39:40.379 --> 02:39:42.629
All right? So I’ll just touch it, all right?

02:39:42.837 --> 02:39:44.171
That means I have accepted.

02:39:44.421 --> 02:39:47.171
May God bless you.

02:39:49.629 --> 02:39:51.212
And when you eat these fruits now,

02:39:51.629 --> 02:39:55.337
you will develop that detachment in your Nabhi Chakra,

02:39:55.671 --> 02:40:01.129
that you will not hanker after fruits of the season,

02:40:03.337 --> 02:40:05.463
but you’ll be satisfied.

02:40:07.004 --> 02:40:09.713
That is auspiciousness, that you feel satisfied.

02:40:10.504 --> 02:40:14.004
And what satisfies you more is giving:

02:40:16.629 --> 02:40:19.713
that’s the sign of a realized soul, you see.

02:40:19.920 --> 02:40:22.254
When you understand the joy of giving,

02:40:22.254 --> 02:40:25.296
then you are a realized soul – otherwise you are not.

02:40:27.296 --> 02:40:29.962
May God bless you.

02:40:30.713 --> 02:40:34.504
Whichever you think I should eat it, I’ll touch them …

02:40:37.504 --> 02:40:44.629
Strawberries? Strawberries I like. It’s the easiest to eat.

02:40:59.879 --> 02:41:01.671
You must eat strawberries always

02:41:01.671 --> 02:41:05.463
with a little bit of salt for the throat.

02:41:15.713 --> 02:41:16.296
Thank you.

02:41:16.546 --> 02:41:19.713
Now what else? This puja is done now…

02:41:40.087 --> 02:41:43.753
See your scholarship! Absolutely is true.

02:41:46.837 --> 02:41:50.546
Now as you have done the job of the unmarried girls,

02:41:50.879 --> 02:41:56.463
let the unmarried girls do this. Come along.

02:41:59.463 --> 02:42:02.463
Unmarried girls from Brighton.

02:42:23.754 --> 02:42:27.045
Brighton is a nice place, very few unmarried girls!

02:42:30.504 --> 02:42:31.296
Unmarried men, all right.

02:42:31.296 --> 02:42:34.629
Let unmarried men and unmarried girls! Come along.

02:42:38.045 --> 02:42:45.962
Unmarried men of Brighton. Only two? Three?

02:42:53.296 --> 02:42:56.129
Mike, you are supposed to be Brighton fellow.

02:42:57.254 --> 02:43:00.254
All right, come along. You become one.

02:43:02.795 --> 02:43:05.212
You can include Anand if you want.

02:43:07.171 --> 02:43:09.421
He’s from Shicarpur.

02:43:09.421 --> 02:43:12.129
And Sonu. Sonu, you can join us, all right? Open the sari.

02:43:21.087 --> 02:43:23.337
Gavin, that’s too much.

02:43:23.588 --> 02:43:26.671
Who has done – this is too much!

02:43:33.504 --> 02:43:37.296
See, these are very expensive in England,

02:43:37.588 --> 02:43:42.296
you should not buy them. Bought in India?

02:44:04.588 --> 02:44:07.337
Open it out. It’s beautiful, isn’t it?

02:44:07.671 --> 02:44:10.129
It has got fans, I think, and what else?

02:44:11.879 --> 02:44:14.129
Real Bengali sari.

02:44:17.045 --> 02:44:20.254
That’s the blouse-piece.

02:44:23.504 --> 02:44:25.754
It’s complete with the blouse-piece.

02:44:28.588 --> 02:44:35.212
Now, the bachelors must know which side is right side.

02:44:41.713 --> 02:44:43.879
Is correct, you’re right.

02:44:44.129 --> 02:44:44.879
This side is right side.

02:44:44.879 --> 02:44:47.171
Now bring the sari round.

02:44:50.129 --> 02:44:52.546
It’s a training!

02:45:04.463 --> 02:45:06.588
Ah, how nice!

02:45:09.795 --> 02:45:11.588
So can you take the photograph of all

02:45:11.837 --> 02:45:14.629
the bachelors and the spinsters?

02:45:26.879 --> 02:45:28.546
All girls.

02:45:31.296 --> 02:45:34.671
In India they are called as kanya, kanya.

02:45:56.920 --> 02:46:00.920
Are you not a bachelor? A bachelor ….

02:46:33.045 --> 02:46:35.379
Done now?

02:46:45.753 --> 02:46:49.546
This is from London. All right.

02:47:35.588 --> 02:47:38.379
It’s very beautiful.

02:47:42.713 --> 02:47:44.671
This one is from Brighton.

02:47:45.962 --> 02:47:52.629
Let Jeremy put it, the Brighton, all right? Jeremy.

02:48:24.171 --> 02:48:26.212
The sari.

02:48:26.671 --> 02:48:28.754
Get this out, it’s too much.

02:48:29.879 --> 02:48:33.087
Let’s put the sari on both the sides.

02:48:43.754 --> 02:48:46.920
Is that for the arms? Now come along, come along now.

02:48:47.337 --> 02:48:50.171
Bachelors have a special – they’re blessed today.

02:48:53.129 --> 02:48:56.837
They are called as kumaras, kumar.

02:48:57.753 --> 02:49:02.837
And the, I suppose what they call spinsters are called as –

02:49:04.753 --> 02:49:06.754
but what do you say in English?

02:49:10.421 --> 02:49:12.879
This is the word, but you use for old women!

02:49:24.629 --> 02:49:27.129
Then it is the marriage is announced?

02:49:31.962 --> 02:49:33.629
I see.

02:49:33.629 --> 02:49:35.753
So, they are called as kumaris,

02:49:36.753 --> 02:49:40.087
and the boys are called as kumars.

02:49:42.421 --> 02:49:45.962
I think Sanskrit has more decent names, isn’t it?

02:49:48.588 --> 02:49:51.379
That’s because they respect the unmarried men

02:49:51.671 --> 02:49:56.337
and unmarried women very much – they’re very much respected.

02:50:07.962 --> 02:50:12.379
This for arm? Arm, here. And here,

02:50:13.045 --> 02:50:16.753
it’s too small – too loose, too loose.

02:50:19.546 --> 02:50:25.212
Better make it tight. Tie it up.

02:50:27.212 --> 02:50:30.337
Must tie it tight, otherwise it doesn’t stay, you see.

02:50:35.254 --> 02:50:37.754
This is for Shri Chakra,

02:50:38.129 --> 02:50:41.337
or you can say the right Nabhi and Shri.

02:50:50.045 --> 02:50:53.212
Why his hands are shaking – with vibrations!

02:50:57.962 --> 02:51:01.837
Ah, great – it’s a great task you have done.

02:51:02.837 --> 02:51:04.713
Yes, it is.

02:51:10.379 --> 02:51:12.129
Just pull it, pull it out.

02:51:15.171 --> 02:51:16.837
First tie it that way.

02:51:17.837 --> 02:51:19.504
Give him a hand.

02:51:46.962 --> 02:51:48.837
Come along, tie it up properly.

02:51:49.463 --> 02:51:56.129
Come along, come along. Tie up …right.

02:52:23.753 --> 02:52:27.087
No, when you have done it with these daisies,

02:52:27.671 --> 02:52:29.379
you have done it.

02:52:39.087 --> 02:52:40.671
All right now.

02:52:41.212 --> 02:52:43.337
It’s all right, done; it’s a great job, no?

02:52:53.087 --> 02:52:54.754
It’s not easy.

02:52:55.045 --> 02:52:57.753
It’s only because you are Sahaja yogis you can do it.

02:52:58.754 --> 02:53:01.837
No, no, it’s not easy. Ask anyone.

02:53:12.337 --> 02:53:13.962
These flowers in front.

02:53:17.671 --> 02:53:22.588
These are all Vishnu’s powers.

02:53:47.754 --> 02:53:49.962
Such fragrant!

02:53:50.296 --> 02:53:52.879
Look at this one, has such a Sahasrara open.

02:53:53.212 --> 02:53:54.837
See these daisies,

02:53:55.087 --> 02:53:57.588
see what a beautiful Sahasrara they have!

02:53:57.837 --> 02:54:02.671
See these, look at this one. Just see it, all of you.

02:54:03.004 --> 02:54:05.212
Only the daisy flower have this kind of … in them,

02:54:05.463 --> 02:54:06.920
have you noticed?

02:54:07.254 --> 02:54:09.504
And now you will know why My name is Daisy.

02:54:15.379 --> 02:54:20.463
See, one better than the other – see?

02:54:24.962 --> 02:54:26.546
Yes, really!

02:54:27.212 --> 02:54:29.087
Yes, that’s it!

02:54:29.087 --> 02:54:30.296
And the fragrance,

02:54:30.546 --> 02:54:33.504
you should see the fragrance of the daisies.

02:56:03.879 --> 02:56:10.337
All right, I think the boys put the sari in such a way.

02:59:12.753 --> 02:59:16.296
May God bless you.

03:03:17.504 --> 03:03:20.171
May God bless you.

03:04:34.045 --> 03:04:38.004
I would suggest that all these

03:04:38.463 --> 03:04:40.879
should be given to the sea here.

03:04:49.879 --> 03:04:52.713
These flowers can be thrown into the sea.

03:05:10.379 --> 03:05:12.920
Yogi: Mother, may I read a prayer?

03:05:14.962 --> 03:05:16.754
This is a prayer for collectivity.

03:05:17.962 --> 03:05:22.129
All right. Read it loud. Stand up.

03:07:59.337 --> 03:08:02.087
Very good.

03:08:04.296 --> 03:08:07.296
Vishuddhi is a very big fight, I must say,

03:08:08.546 --> 03:08:12.337
to work it out as Shri Krishna.

03:08:13.129 --> 03:08:17.588
This left Vishuddhi is a big problem, very sly.

03:08:20.920 --> 03:08:23.045
Right Vishuddhi is another problem.

03:08:26.463 --> 03:08:29.546
We have to fight it out.

03:08:39.337 --> 03:08:43.129
May God bless you all.

03:08:49.504 --> 03:08:51.962
So havan we’ll do, after lunch –

03:09:04.421 --> 03:09:07.004
would you do with Ganesha’s names?

03:10:17.920 --> 03:10:20.171
Unfolding is easier than to fold it.

03:10:25.753 --> 03:10:28.421
Give it to the bachelors to do!
