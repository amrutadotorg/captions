00:00:00.761 --> 00:00:06.846
The birthday of Your Mother, and
all such celebrations

00:00:07.047 --> 00:00:10.625
have a very deep significance,

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:22.368
because on such occasions, special
vibrations flow in the atmosphere.

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:30.766
When all the celestial bodies,

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:37.019
the Eternal Personalities,

00:00:37.673 --> 00:00:45.281
Gods and Goddesses sing the praise,

00:00:46.431 --> 00:00:54.673
and that’s how the whole atmosphere
is filled with mirth and happiness.

00:00:57.154 --> 00:01:04.920
Human beings also express their gratitude.

00:01:05.121 --> 00:01:12.573
The expression of gratitude
and love

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.623
is done in different, different ways
in different countries,

00:01:18.824 --> 00:01:28.294
but the substance remains the same
and the forms change.

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:40.265
The substance is like the ocean which flows

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:47.641
continuously towards the shores

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:53.787
and the ripples which touch the shores

00:01:53.988 --> 00:02:01.871
are again repelled back, and a nice
pattern is formed.

00:02:05.447 --> 00:02:12.073
It is such a spontaneous thing
and is so beautiful,

00:02:12.274 --> 00:02:16.225
creates such a beautiful pattern
in the atmosphere.

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:22.965
All these waves when they weave together
the pattern of love

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:28.617
they soothe human beings, they enchant
human beings

00:02:28.818 --> 00:02:32.347
and the whole thing is very blissful.

00:02:35.152 --> 00:02:43.059
On such occasions a special type
of feelings develop,

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.784
which we cannot express in words

00:02:50.526 --> 00:02:56.650
so the expression could be in any form.

00:02:57.532 --> 00:03:05.586
But the main thing is the expression.
God has expressed Himself by Creation,

00:03:05.911 --> 00:03:09.259
by creating this Creation.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.024
While the Creation has to express
its gratitude

00:03:13.225 --> 00:03:20.786
by glorifying Him, and this play must
go on eternally.

00:03:20.987 --> 00:03:25.109
It’s the most beautiful play.

00:03:25.863 --> 00:03:33.313
Those who indulge into this play
lead an eternal life.

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:39.323
That life is unending, never breaks

00:03:39.524 --> 00:03:45.639
and binds the whole universe with
its beautiful music.

00:03:52.538 --> 00:03:58.359
Today, specially, I have to speak to people

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:05.582
who feel weak to follow Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:05.788 --> 00:04:12.852
who are fickle minded, those who
lack strength,

00:04:13.053 --> 00:04:22.502
those who are afraid of taking Sahaja
Yoga seriously.

00:04:24.187 --> 00:04:33.178
It is very important that fickle mindedness
must be seen clearly – why we are fickle.

00:04:33.742 --> 00:04:40.794
Mostly it might be the ego that
is stopping you

00:04:40.995 --> 00:04:46.808
from doing something that is very,
very important.

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.772
The ficklemindedness comes to us by various
ways, as I said one of them is ego.

00:04:54.973 --> 00:04:59.881
A fickle minded person can be frightened
by his own ego

00:05:00.082 --> 00:05:08.072
and he may stop doing Sahaja Yoga
after going up to a point,

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:13.214
because the ego might say now,
“Here forward, if you go,

00:05:13.415 --> 00:05:18.027
there is a tunnel in which you cannot
enter.

00:05:18.228 --> 00:05:23.964
You should not go any further.
It’s very dangerous."

00:05:24.808 --> 00:05:32.130
It could be marred by your Sloth. Sloth
is the curse of this country I feel.

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:35.895
It’s the curse of the Sahaja Yoga also.

00:05:36.096 --> 00:05:39.538
I do not know if it is the curse
of the Western World

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:50.675
but Sloth is something, is like a devil
that can keep you very much glued

00:05:51.817 --> 00:05:55.299
to your own positions and will
not allow you to move out.

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:02.382
For example in the morning you get up
and you think that, “Oh, it’s all right,

00:06:02.583 --> 00:06:04.837
what’s the need to get up early
in the morning?

00:06:05.038 --> 00:06:09.192
There is no need to do any meditation.

00:06:10.981 --> 00:06:15.980
I’ll do it tomorrow”. Otherwise you start
thinking that,

00:06:16.181 --> 00:06:18.898
“It can be done after a month,
doesn’t matter,

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:22.795
Mataji is here, everything will be
all right."

00:06:22.996 --> 00:06:28.456
But you must know that there are so many
imperfections within you,

00:06:28.657 --> 00:06:35.167
and if you do not meditate now, seriously,
take it up as a very serious thing,

00:06:35.368 --> 00:06:40.094
you may lag behind so much that
you may be dropped out.

00:06:40.295 --> 00:06:43.852
Meditation is very important
after Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:44.053 --> 00:06:49.432
You have slept and slept all your life.
Sleeping is not so important.

00:06:49.633 --> 00:06:53.247
You have to today promise Me that,
from tomorrow,

00:06:53.448 --> 00:06:59.411
you all are going to get up in the morning
and meditate.

00:07:00.415 --> 00:07:03.623
I was suggesting that if you take your
baths in the morning would be better,

00:07:03.824 --> 00:07:08.197
so that you won’t have your sleepy
condition.

00:07:08.398 --> 00:07:13.646
Sloth is such a devious thing that you do
not see it.

00:07:13.847 --> 00:07:17.042
It explains everything. If you say,
“Oh I am sick”

00:07:17.242 --> 00:07:21.471
it will say, “Oh you are so sick you should
go to the hospital”.

00:07:21.672 --> 00:07:25.644
If you say, “I’m tired” it will say,
“You are extremely tired”.

00:07:25.845 --> 00:07:31.439
Why should you be so tired? It is nothing
but your Sloth is telling you that,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:35.505
“You are extremely tired, you better
not do meditation

00:07:35.706 --> 00:07:39.905
now you are extremely tired. You better
take some rest, is important”.

00:07:40.106 --> 00:07:44.043
Sloth is worse than superego and ego.

00:07:44.244 --> 00:07:48.591
Is a kind of an inertia which pulls
you down,

00:07:48.792 --> 00:07:53.722
and that inertia you have to really
throw away and get out of it.

00:07:53.923 --> 00:07:59.869
Because it explains everything, you like
it, because it gives you little comfort,

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:04.012
and you want to rely on your Sloth.

00:08:04.213 --> 00:08:08.839
But Krishna has said in Gita, that Sloth
is the worst thing

00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:12.502
that can happen to human beings.
If they take to Sloth,

00:08:12.703 --> 00:08:19.708
if they accept Sloth, they will have
all explanations for being Slothful.

00:08:19.909 --> 00:08:23.637
He, “Alasya”, He calls it, is the worst
disease according to Him,

00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:28.530
for any aspirant of spiritual life.

00:08:31.021 --> 00:08:35.186
You may think that, “You see, I’m not
well now”

00:08:35.387 --> 00:08:38.058
or anything, Sloth can give you
any ideas.

00:08:38.259 --> 00:08:42.212
Because I don’t have that so I don’t know
what ideas it gives you

00:08:42.413 --> 00:08:47.561
but it can give you any kind of idea
that would be very, very appealing to you

00:08:47.762 --> 00:08:50.498
because it knows how to please
your ego.

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:57.227
Sloth is a ego-satisfying thing,
ego-pampering stuff,

00:08:57.428 --> 00:09:00.578
and it makes you feel that, “Oh you are
very tired”. What are you tired about?

00:09:00.779 --> 00:09:03.220
You are all young people, why should you
be tired?

00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:09.817
You get tired so soon, is nothing but
your Mr. Sloth telling you you are tired.

00:09:10.018 --> 00:09:15.984
You'll be surprised, after feeling tired
you'll run for two miles, you can run.

00:09:16.293 --> 00:09:24.820
Now why Sloth works Sahaja Yoga
so adversely?

00:09:25.021 --> 00:09:29.543
Why Sloth works out against Sahaja Yoga
so much?

00:09:29.744 --> 00:09:36.805
The reason is, because we are not yet
identified with our wellbeing.

00:09:37.006 --> 00:09:40.850
We do not think that “We have to be better,
we have to improve,

00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:45.212
we have to go further, there’s a big gap,
we have to do it”.

00:09:45.413 --> 00:09:50.945
We are not identified with our progress.
Supposing if I tell you, in England,

00:09:51.146 --> 00:09:56.110
that if you run two miles every day in
the morning, you will get a beauty prize,

00:09:56.311 --> 00:10:03.809
99.9% people, of women of this country,
would be running early in the morning.

00:10:04.010 --> 00:10:07.930
Supposing if somebody tells men

00:10:08.145 --> 00:10:14.112
that, “You will get Mr. Universe if you
run every day five miles in the morning”,

00:10:14.313 --> 00:10:20.533
there will be, I don’t know, 99.999%
people may be running like that,

00:10:20.734 --> 00:10:23.740
because we are identified with that kind
of a competition

00:10:23.940 --> 00:10:31.213
which is very materialistic, which is
of no value.

00:10:31.414 --> 00:10:36.292
But when you give up even that competition
you fall into another competition

00:10:36.506 --> 00:10:40.476
is everybody is competing each other
in Sloth.

00:10:40.677 --> 00:10:44.116
They will get up in the morning,
see around,

00:10:44.317 --> 00:10:47.607
“Now, Cooly’s still sleeping, all right,
let me sleep”.

00:10:47.807 --> 00:10:51.181
So Cooly will think, “He’s still sleeping,
let me sleep”.

00:10:51.382 --> 00:10:59.118
So there is a big competition on as to
who is going to wake up first,

00:10:59.319 --> 00:11:01.825
who is going to do this.

00:11:02.026 --> 00:11:07.259
And if somebody gets up then one starts
finding faults that, “He got up but what?

00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.105
He was just taking tea” or “He was
talking”.

00:11:10.306 --> 00:11:12.220
What about you? You were still in bed!

00:11:12.420 --> 00:11:16.391
At least he got up, was talking, doesn’t
matter. But he was kicking.

00:11:16.592 --> 00:11:21.107
What about you who was still slumbering
in the bed?

00:11:21.308 --> 00:11:25.360
Now it’s such a childlike thing, I mean,
it’s such a childish thing to talk about

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.338
with such intellectuals as you are, such
well read and such well posted people.

00:11:30.539 --> 00:11:35.292
That doesn’t behove Me, a Mother
of such great people, to talk like this,

00:11:35.493 --> 00:11:40.951
but sometimes I find My Sahaja Yogis
are like two year old children,

00:11:41.152 --> 00:11:46.054
and then I have to tell them that,
“Now you are grown up”.

00:11:46.255 --> 00:11:50.005
You see, you can explain it

00:11:50.894 --> 00:11:56.534
but how are you going to explain yourself?

00:11:57.901 --> 00:12:04.894
Because if you have to grow, if you want
your tree to grow,

00:12:05.576 --> 00:12:09.707
you must change your priorities
and your identifications.

00:12:09.908 --> 00:12:16.664
If you have to be a first-class Sahaja
Yogi, you have to put your attention to it.

00:12:16.865 --> 00:12:23.779
I do not know how to fix it up.
Supposing we fix it up like this,

00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:29.145
it’s very childish but I have to tell you
because I have seen this is the problem,

00:12:29.346 --> 00:12:35.069
that, “The day I don’t get up, I’ll have
to pay 10 pee”, let’s keep it like that.

00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:39.975
If you are getting much more pay
then put it at ten pounds.

00:12:40.176 --> 00:12:42.836
But something like that. Or you can
say that,

00:12:43.037 --> 00:12:47.794
“That day I’ll give up one sweater
of mine”. Start it like that.

00:12:47.995 --> 00:12:51.882
It’s very easy. People will say that,
“No Mother, when I meditate,

00:12:52.083 --> 00:12:54.765
you know, something goes wrong with me” –
means you are wrong,

00:12:54.966 --> 00:12:59.958
there’s something wrong with you.
So you better sit down and meditate.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:07.497
Now, I must say, if you do not meditate,
you are very selfish.

00:13:07.698 --> 00:13:13.034
That’s the main point is. Because
when you come here,

00:13:13.235 --> 00:13:16.735
scorpions come out of you [Mother says “Me”
but obviously means “you”] to bite My feet.

00:13:16.936 --> 00:13:23.712
There are snakes coming out of you to bite
My feet. Do you want to do that to Me?

00:13:23.913 --> 00:13:26.398
Or else to others also.

00:13:26.599 --> 00:13:30.672
The other day somebody came to My house and
Chaya and all these people were there.

00:13:30.873 --> 00:13:35.386
He was so caught up that they were
reeling with giddiness,

00:13:35.587 --> 00:13:40.699
and everybody was trying to take it out
and work it out.

00:13:42.536 --> 00:13:49.140
If you want Sahaja Yoga to work out
in this country and in the West,

00:13:49.353 --> 00:13:54.375
we have to understand our own value,
and we must work it out.

00:13:54.576 --> 00:13:59.925
Every time if you are catching, every time
you meet Me you are catching,

00:14:00.126 --> 00:14:03.678
then how are you going to feel
the Kundalini?

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:08.489
You must know how the Kundalini moves
within yourself.

00:14:08.690 --> 00:14:12.082
Say, where it is, how far it has gone.

00:14:12.283 --> 00:14:17.797
At least there should be at least
ten people like that, minimum,

00:14:17.998 --> 00:14:20.991
because I have worked here so hard.

00:14:21.205 --> 00:14:24.016
You don’t know, I didn’t work
so many years in India

00:14:24.217 --> 00:14:28.500
and there will be at least 80% people
who can feel the Kundalini moving –

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:31.538
it is here, it is there, it is there.

00:14:31.739 --> 00:14:36.017
And some people feel over-satisfied
with their progress also.

00:14:36.218 --> 00:14:41.804
It is like a full group of people going
somewhere, say a tug-of-war.

00:14:42.005 --> 00:14:48.500
Even one person moves two steps forward
than where he is, the whole thing moves.

00:14:49.206 --> 00:14:53.754
But we do not see to the people who are
moving it towards them,

00:14:53.955 --> 00:15:01.138
what we always see is, “How can we compete
with the person who is not moving?

00:15:01.339 --> 00:15:07.354
If he is moving back two steps, we can
move back three steps."

00:15:07.656 --> 00:15:12.619
This kind of attitude will not help us.

00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.707
You know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way,

00:15:16.908 --> 00:15:23.782
is the only method that Divine Grace
has given you, by which

00:15:23.983 --> 00:15:29.682
you are going to transform the whole
world, and lazy lumps:

00:15:29.883 --> 00:15:36.789
how can they help Sahaja Yoga?
Laziness is the worst thing today.

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:41.239
I know today is not a day to say all these
things, but you all have to promise to Me

00:15:41.440 --> 00:15:46.951
that you are going to give up your
laziness – Swaha.

00:15:47.152 --> 00:15:53.215
That’s what I have seen that, whenever
I meet you people you are caught up.

00:15:53.667 --> 00:16:01.507
The another thing which goes against Sahaja
Yoga is, I have told you hundred times,

00:16:01.708 --> 00:16:08.508
I don’t know how many times, is to talk ill
about other Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:08.709 --> 00:16:13.933
We are all part and parcel of one body, say
we are all part and parcel of one hand.

00:16:14.134 --> 00:16:21.125
Now if this finger starts talking ill about
this one, what is it going to do?

00:16:21.768 --> 00:16:27.057
Talking ill about each other is a very
wrong thing.

00:16:27.258 --> 00:16:33.877
So today also decide that, “We will never
talk ill about anybody else

00:16:34.078 --> 00:16:39.060
but we’ll look at ourselves – what is
our position."

00:16:39.549 --> 00:16:42.283
I’ve seen people passing remarks
about other people

00:16:42.484 --> 00:16:45.847
who themselves are very badly caught up,

00:16:47.228 --> 00:16:51.234
and not worried about themselves. Now,
by this, how are you going to improve?

00:16:51.435 --> 00:16:55.423
If you do not pay attention to yourself, and
pay attention to others you cannot improve.

00:16:55.624 --> 00:17:02.643
So another promise should be that, “We will
not talk ill about other Sahaja Yogis."

00:17:02.844 --> 00:17:08.062
But no Sahaja Yogi should take anything for
granted.

00:17:08.866 --> 00:17:12.536
We have to really work very hard.

00:17:15.002 --> 00:17:22.175
So second habit of talking ill about other
Sahaja Yogis should be Swaha,

00:17:22.376 --> 00:17:25.175
and thinking even about it.

00:17:25.376 --> 00:17:28.667
You are absolutely cutting the threads
of Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:28.868 --> 00:17:32.612
which I have very sweetly woven.

00:17:32.954 --> 00:17:36.868
Now you would be generous to Me, I know.
You can be very generous, you have given Me

00:17:37.069 --> 00:17:40.940
a very beautiful painting, I am
very thankful to you.

00:17:41.141 --> 00:17:45.696
But try to do it to others also –
generosity.

00:17:45.897 --> 00:17:50.429
You should be really bound together and you
can see then what we can produce.

00:17:50.629 --> 00:17:55.486
You have seen how nicely we did
the exhibition. Everybody was enamored.

00:17:55.687 --> 00:18:01.054
Everybody was very happy that you did
so well. It was such a joyous thing

00:18:01.255 --> 00:18:04.494
and everybody was congratulating,
they telephoned to Me.

00:18:04.695 --> 00:18:07.163
They said, “How they are together?

00:18:07.364 --> 00:18:11.096
There was no quarrel, no fighting, nothing.
They did it so well."

00:18:11.297 --> 00:18:16.189
So tell your mind that, “How dare you
think against any Sahaja Yogi”.

00:18:16.390 --> 00:18:20.891
Do you know all of you are saints
of the highest calibre?

00:18:21.092 --> 00:18:28.147
And this kind of wretched, nonsensical
thing, so low level, how can you do?

00:18:29.060 --> 00:18:32.915
I may talk ill about others,

00:18:33.158 --> 00:18:36.979
I may say that, “He’s bad”, just
to test you.

00:18:37.179 --> 00:18:43.276
So many times I do that to see how
you feel about someone.

00:18:44.284 --> 00:18:47.369
If I say somebody’s bad, just keep quiet.

00:18:47.570 --> 00:18:52.292
It will have two purposes. One will
be that,

00:18:52.493 --> 00:18:56.408
if you are sympathising with someone,
so I am saying, “Don’t sympathize”

00:18:56.609 --> 00:18:59.208
because you are sympathizing with
a wrong person.

00:18:59.409 --> 00:19:02.948
Or maybe I am just testing you.

00:19:03.149 --> 00:19:06.492
So keep it noted in your mind, if I say
that person is no good,

00:19:06.685 --> 00:19:11.370
then keep it in your mind, “Am I
sympathizing with that person?”

00:19:11.576 --> 00:19:15.834
This negative sympathy is very common.

00:19:16.035 --> 00:19:22.539
So third promise should be that we will
not sympathize.

00:19:22.740 --> 00:19:28.259
If you sympathize, ‘sym-pathize’ means
‘you share the pathos of others’.

00:19:28.460 --> 00:19:32.132
You have to just share the joy of another
person.

00:19:32.362 --> 00:19:36.693
So we will not sympathize with others,
with anyone,

00:19:36.894 --> 00:19:42.696
but we will share the joy of another
person.

00:19:43.038 --> 00:19:46.036
The part that is joy of another person,
we are going to share

00:19:46.237 --> 00:19:49.925
and look out for the joy. Try to see
the good points.

00:19:50.126 --> 00:19:53.701
Some people just cannot see.

00:19:55.375 --> 00:20:01.199
That’s how you dominate each other.
That’s a wrong thing.

00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:08.003
In a growth of vital importance it is
important to know,

00:20:08.204 --> 00:20:12.804
what are the vital parts. If you try
to press one vital part,

00:20:13.005 --> 00:20:19.450
you cannot grow also, because you are
all supported together.

00:20:19.903 --> 00:20:22.750
So the third thing is – you have to promise

00:20:22.956 --> 00:20:33.877
that you are not anymore going
to sympathize with anybody else.

00:20:35.441 --> 00:20:39.970
None of you can love as much as I can love.

00:20:41.555 --> 00:20:48.073
And then one should know that if you have
sympathies, there is no need at all.

00:20:48.274 --> 00:20:52.771
But you should have feelings for everyone.

00:20:54.995 --> 00:21:00.896
Now every human being has a character
and a temperament.

00:21:01.444 --> 00:21:06.728
Apart from his Self, is his Spirit which
is pure, in its own form,

00:21:06.929 --> 00:21:10.216
it just gives you vibrations, tells you
right, left and all that.

00:21:10.417 --> 00:21:13.017
But everybody has a character,
is important,

00:21:13.218 --> 00:21:18.463
because the light that is burning
in a candle can be different style,

00:21:18.664 --> 00:21:23.367
another different style. Looks nice,
variety looks nice, it gives you beauty.

00:21:23.568 --> 00:21:26.130
So your character you must know.

00:21:26.331 --> 00:21:31.568
Respect your character and enjoy
the character of another person.

00:21:31.769 --> 00:21:34.769
I really enjoy your characters

00:21:34.970 --> 00:21:38.103
and how sweetly you behave towards
your own characters.

00:21:38.304 --> 00:21:40.736
But temperament is not your Self.

00:21:40.937 --> 00:21:45.137
Temperaments you must give up.
Temperaments are horrid things.

00:21:45.338 --> 00:21:50.576
You give up your temperaments but keep
to your character.

00:21:50.777 --> 00:21:55.696
A character is something so great,
is something so sweet,

00:21:55.897 --> 00:22:01.309
and I see that character in a person,
and I feel like –

00:22:01.510 --> 00:22:05.497
how is it they are not identifying with
their character but with temperament?

00:22:05.698 --> 00:22:10.839
For supposing somebody has a temperament of
saying something silly – is a temperament.

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.833
So you just say, “What is this going on?

00:22:14.034 --> 00:22:17.001
Why am I saying things silly?
I better get rid of it”.

00:22:17.202 --> 00:22:20.969
Somebody has a temperament of getting
boiled up very fast –

00:22:21.170 --> 00:22:25.559
so you see to it that this temperament
is not your character.

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:31.003
But some people are so low level that even
in their character you can find

00:22:31.204 --> 00:22:35.346
something going on and on and on,
which is – their temperament has become

00:22:35.547 --> 00:22:38.592
one with their character.
So try to separate.

00:22:38.792 --> 00:22:43.801
First of all you separate yourself from
your temperament to your character,

00:22:43.971 --> 00:22:49.652
and in that character you enlighten
your light.

00:22:49.853 --> 00:22:54.856
See how beautiful you will be, you’ll enjoy
each other much more.

00:22:55.057 --> 00:23:00.375
Now when you are with Me, I know everything
about you, no doubt.

00:23:00.576 --> 00:23:05.078
Everything. In your mind, what’s going,
I read minds.

00:23:05.279 --> 00:23:10.524
I read everything, but what I see
is your light.

00:23:10.725 --> 00:23:16.839
Then what I see is your character. I do
not bother about your temperament,

00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:20.435
but a time comes when this temperament
becomes more dominant thing.

00:23:20.636 --> 00:23:23.676
You become so much identified with
[dominant], “I am like that!

00:23:23.877 --> 00:23:27.208
I am like that! What to do? I am like that!
It happens to me.

00:23:27.409 --> 00:23:32.805
I…I…I…I…I." So the fourth resolution
should be – No more “I”.

00:23:32.982 --> 00:23:39.093
We are not going to talk about “I”,
“I think”, “I believe”. Who are you?

00:23:39.294 --> 00:23:44.748
“I believe” – now who are you?
Are you Jesus Christ,

00:23:44.949 --> 00:23:50.206
that your beliefs and your faiths
are that great?

00:23:50.407 --> 00:23:56.326
So we should say, “We believe”,
“We are like that”.

00:23:56.527 --> 00:23:59.754
Now we have to move in one body,

00:23:59.955 --> 00:24:03.129
with all our different characters we have
to say “We”,

00:24:03.330 --> 00:24:07.592
“We which are part and parcel
of one personality."

00:24:07.793 --> 00:24:11.981
So always say “We”, and this is
how we must know

00:24:12.182 --> 00:24:17.287
that these temperaments are the things
which keeps us out from everyone.

00:24:17.488 --> 00:24:21.447
Temperaments can be – somebody is
a crying baby.

00:24:21.648 --> 00:24:23.843
Then that person will remain a crying baby

00:24:24.044 --> 00:24:27.604
for such a long time till I’ll break
My head.

00:24:27.805 --> 00:24:30.864
If somebody is a frightened person,
he’ll be always frightened like that.

00:24:31.065 --> 00:24:35.085
You say anything – frightened.
It’s useless.

00:24:35.286 --> 00:24:37.965
Why to be like that? You be normal.

00:24:38.166 --> 00:24:43.766
If you have that kind of a temperament
you be normal. Is not good.

00:24:43.967 --> 00:24:47.150
Some person is an aggressive person,
or a hot tempered person.

00:24:47.351 --> 00:24:50.573
He’ll be losing temper all the time.
That’s a temperament again,

00:24:50.774 --> 00:24:54.928
that’s not his character. Character shows
in small, small things.

00:24:55.129 --> 00:24:58.640
I’ll show you a character.

00:25:00.367 --> 00:25:05.161
Now a person has a character that
he’s very generous.

00:25:06.130 --> 00:25:11.626
He will say something which will be
very generous.

00:25:11.827 --> 00:25:15.222
A person who is a loving character,

00:25:15.423 --> 00:25:19.319
he will do something which will show
that he’s extremely loving.

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.721
So you first find out what is your
character.

00:25:21.922 --> 00:25:26.004
Supposing you are a loving person,
then why not love each other?

00:25:26.205 --> 00:25:29.806
Why not talk of love? Why not be kind?

00:25:30.007 --> 00:25:33.629
We suppress that, and we take
our temperament as our own.

00:25:33.830 --> 00:25:35.928
And once you take your temperament
as your own,

00:25:36.129 --> 00:25:40.534
there are problems and problems and
problems. They are just like bubbles.

00:25:40.735 --> 00:25:45.794
These temperaments have no value,
no substance, useless.

00:25:45.995 --> 00:25:49.017
And they are the greatest joy killers.

00:25:49.218 --> 00:25:53.524
If you have one person who is
temperamental – [you’ve] had it.

00:25:53.725 --> 00:25:58.530
All of you will know that this person has
this temperament – they’ll run away.

00:25:58.731 --> 00:26:02.414
People have their own ways of doing things,

00:26:02.615 --> 00:26:08.135
that one has to merge, has to surrender
to The Whole.

00:26:08.336 --> 00:26:13.348
We must learn to surrender our own
little, little things to The Whole,

00:26:13.549 --> 00:26:17.682
and then you’ll be surprised that we
will become

00:26:17.883 --> 00:26:22.187
so congenial, so integrated – despite
our different characters.

00:26:22.388 --> 00:26:25.897
You have to maintain your different
character, different style of talking,

00:26:26.098 --> 00:26:29.473
different style of walking, different style
of expression.

00:26:29.674 --> 00:26:33.926
But the character, if it is not brought
forward,

00:26:34.127 --> 00:26:37.568
the whole thing is so ugly so horrid.

00:26:37.769 --> 00:26:46.283
Like the stinking, rotting leaves
these days.

00:26:47.180 --> 00:26:53.537
But if you remove the leaves, these
old leaves, these useless leaves,

00:26:53.738 --> 00:26:57.781
then you find the beautiful grass below.

00:26:58.704 --> 00:27:02.201
So nobody should identify with your
temperament.

00:27:02.402 --> 00:27:06.226
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:06.427 --> 00:27:09.638
You must know that people are going
to come to Sahaja Yoga

00:27:09.807 --> 00:27:13.926
because of you not because of Me.

00:27:14.127 --> 00:27:17.608
They cannot understand Me.
I am beyond them.

00:27:17.809 --> 00:27:21.798
I say something of the seventh floor.
They just don’t understand.

00:27:21.999 --> 00:27:25.650
They will understand you, not Me.

00:27:25.851 --> 00:27:29.418
This is very important, perhaps you people
do not realize.

00:27:29.619 --> 00:27:32.905
You are not, supposing, taking Sahaja Yoga
seriously,

00:27:33.106 --> 00:27:36.726
you are not doing anything about it.
You are still very much attached to things.

00:27:36.927 --> 00:27:39.575
You are not willing to do this, you are
not willing to do that,

00:27:39.776 --> 00:27:41.693
you don’t want to give up this or that.

00:27:41.894 --> 00:27:46.610
Then people will say, “Oh he’s a Sahaj
Yogi, such a person. How can he be?

00:27:46.811 --> 00:27:49.233
What has he achieved?” You may say,
“I’ve got the Bliss,

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:53.348
Mother has given me the Bliss”, they’ll
say, “Not, we cant see that in your face”.

00:27:53.549 --> 00:27:57.200
You are still criticizing each other.
Still you think no end of yourself,

00:27:57.401 --> 00:28:00.300
still you are catching here and there.

00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:07.515
So it is you, you are the reflection
of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:28:08.388 --> 00:28:11.120
They will know, they will see, “All right,
She is all right”.

00:28:11.321 --> 00:28:14.270
I have seen people who are My relations,
they will say, “Oh You are Beyond.

00:28:14.471 --> 00:28:17.222
Nobody can reach You and so we are
not going to try."

00:28:17.423 --> 00:28:19.911
But if they see there are some people
have reached somewhere,

00:28:20.112 --> 00:28:23.783
then they will come. Isn’t it?
So you are like people,

00:28:23.984 --> 00:28:28.086
say I’m placed on the seventh floor and you
are placed on the first floor, all of you.

00:28:28.287 --> 00:28:30.880
Then you come to the third floor then
people start seeing.

00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:33.560
The first floor people cannot see
the seventh floor,

00:28:33.761 --> 00:28:36.340
but if you are there at least
on the third floor they say,

00:28:36.541 --> 00:28:39.207
“Oh there are some people on the third
floor, let’s go ahead!”

00:28:39.408 --> 00:28:46.741
It is like that, because people see

00:28:46.955 --> 00:28:52.678
what they can see, they cannot see
what they cannot see.

00:28:52.879 --> 00:28:58.332
So when they see transformation in you,
they see that beauty in you,

00:28:58.533 --> 00:29:02.423
then they know that there is Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:02.624 --> 00:29:07.557
So for Sahaja Yoga’s sake we have
to sacrifice certain things

00:29:07.758 --> 00:29:10.874
and I have told you already that we have
to sacrifice

00:29:11.075 --> 00:29:15.968
all the funny habits or temperaments
we have got,

00:29:16.169 --> 00:29:19.634
that today you have to decide that,
“I’ll give up this”,

00:29:19.835 --> 00:29:24.623
and it is, today, as I told you, there are
special blessings, it will work out.

00:29:24.824 --> 00:29:27.773
You have to become really good
Sahaja Yogis.

00:29:27.974 --> 00:29:31.834
Now by comparing with each other
you cannot.

00:29:33.123 --> 00:29:36.281
By talking to each other you cannot.
It is your own,

00:29:36.482 --> 00:29:40.112
it is you who has to certify
“Am I all right?

00:29:40.313 --> 00:29:42.599
Am I a good Sahaja Yogi? Am I really
progressing?”.

00:29:42.800 --> 00:29:46.216
You must progress, if you do not progress
then you are not growing.

00:29:46.417 --> 00:29:50.927
All of you have to grow, and grow and grow.

00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:58.083
So the last of all is the day when
we are very happy.

00:29:58.284 --> 00:30:02.853
Now this is the first time My birthday
is celebrated in London,

00:30:03.054 --> 00:30:10.913
first time abroad, and all the Indian
Sahaja Yogis must be pining for Me.

00:30:11.114 --> 00:30:15.366
I am sure, all over, they must be terribly
pining for Me,

00:30:15.567 --> 00:30:18.629
so we have to think about them also.

00:30:18.830 --> 00:30:23.077
Think about other Sahaja Yogis, what they
must be doing.

00:30:23.278 --> 00:30:28.916
Think about them – you will feel happy.
You sit down and think about others

00:30:29.117 --> 00:30:32.539
and you’ll feel very happy thinking
about those people

00:30:32.739 --> 00:30:36.856
because they also are your brothers
and sisters.

00:30:37.057 --> 00:30:41.021
And so nice it is to feel that you have
so many brothers and sisters

00:30:41.222 --> 00:30:45.775
who speak the same language.
So we have to transcend

00:30:45.976 --> 00:30:50.594
that limitation that we are in England –
no, we are everywhere,

00:30:50.832 --> 00:30:55.663
and you can in your meditation, think
of all these people who are there.

00:30:55.864 --> 00:31:00.966
Establish your relationships with them.
Establish your understanding with them.

00:31:01.167 --> 00:31:04.128
You write to them. As we have got
pen-friends,

00:31:04.329 --> 00:31:09.018
you can get some pen-friendship and
you can start writing to people.

00:31:09.219 --> 00:31:12.821
It will be a very good idea if you start
something like that.

00:31:13.022 --> 00:31:18.807
But letter writing is another thing
which is Sloth, completely.

00:31:19.008 --> 00:31:22.242
You see I write much...
(Interruption in the audio)

00:31:22.443 --> 00:31:26.224
(...) who has limited money, he
sits down makes a budget.

00:31:26.425 --> 00:31:29.883
In the same way you make the budget
of your timing.

00:31:30.084 --> 00:31:33.914
You are always busy – doing what?

00:31:34.842 --> 00:31:38.033
So let us find out that time, that time

00:31:38.234 --> 00:31:44.325
when you have to allow yourself to grow,
that time which is required

00:31:44.526 --> 00:31:50.527
for your personal attention, which is
required for your evolution,

00:31:50.728 --> 00:31:55.813
that you must give. That is the due
you have to pay

00:31:56.014 --> 00:32:01.602
because you are realized souls now
and the responsibility is your own.

00:32:01.803 --> 00:32:05.915
In this, best thing is to take to wisdom.

00:32:06.116 --> 00:32:09.503
Sit down once and take to wisdom
and think it over,

00:32:09.704 --> 00:32:12.022
“Mataji has given us realization,
all right.

00:32:12.223 --> 00:32:15.557
The germination has started, all right.
Where are we?

00:32:15.758 --> 00:32:19.281
How far are we? Have we got even
our roots or not?

00:32:19.482 --> 00:32:24.094
Have you got the shoots coming out or not?
Where are we?”

00:32:24.295 --> 00:32:26.368
Just find out for yourself.

00:32:26.569 --> 00:32:29.046
I know that Mataji is pulling all of you

00:32:29.247 --> 00:32:33.411
and you are all dragged into it. You have
to be jolly well going, moving somewhere,

00:32:33.612 --> 00:32:37.477
but if you give your motivating force,
all of you.

00:32:37.678 --> 00:32:40.742
Not even one person should drag behind,
because his weight

00:32:40.943 --> 00:32:46.862
is going to pull us back isn’t it?
So that’s why I say it is selfish.

00:32:47.063 --> 00:32:50.947
If anybody lags behind, that weight we have
to pull again.

00:32:51.148 --> 00:32:55.266
So what happens, it’s like the story that
a person who walks

00:32:55.467 --> 00:32:59.615
three steps forward and five steps
backwards. When will he reach?

00:32:59.816 --> 00:33:03.070
He’ll never reach. When will he reach?

00:33:03.271 --> 00:33:06.980
Such a question, you see it is, as they
asked in the mathematics, you see,

00:33:07.181 --> 00:33:12.074
“When will he reach?” Such people who
move backwards faster than the forwards.

00:33:12.275 --> 00:33:17.833
So everybody must decide that, “I am moving
backwards, I must move forwards."

00:33:18.034 --> 00:33:24.931
By that you are helping the whole grow, and
will be the ideal thing for Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:25.132 --> 00:33:27.315
So your individual growth should be
all right,

00:33:27.516 --> 00:33:31.289
and your collective growth should
be all right. It takes not much.

00:33:31.489 --> 00:33:35.275
Meditation you have to do. You have
to sit in Nirvichara.

00:33:35.481 --> 00:33:39.520
You have to give up your thinking. Try
to be in Nirvichar, try to be in Nirvichar,

00:33:39.721 --> 00:33:43.655
and you will be surprised how the thing
will flower out.

00:33:43.856 --> 00:33:49.295
Next year I want to see many more people
to come.

00:33:49.496 --> 00:33:53.379
Apart from that I also want to see
everybody progressing.

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:57.168
You see even if you get thousands of people
and of no quality what’s the use?

00:33:57.369 --> 00:33:59.687
What are we going to do with them?

00:33:59.888 --> 00:34:05.172
We have to have people of quality, people
who will work it out, who will get to it.

00:34:05.373 --> 00:34:12.402
Who are identified but are not working
it out is useless.

00:34:13.302 --> 00:34:18.914
So everyone must work it out, must
work hard.

00:34:19.115 --> 00:34:21.960
Do not criticize others, do not sympathize,

00:34:22.161 --> 00:34:26.370
and go further and further with
your progress.

00:34:26.561 --> 00:34:29.477
The other day I was finding out the meaning
of the word ‘Ashram’,

00:34:29.678 --> 00:34:34.067
means ‘a place for the ascetics to live’.

00:34:36.530 --> 00:34:42.370
Ashram is a place, if you have to go there,
don’t carry all your luggage there.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:44.532
You have to take very few things there.

00:34:44.733 --> 00:34:47.944
You should be able to live with two, three
clothes in an ashram.

00:34:48.145 --> 00:34:53.033
You see, Ashram is a place where you are
trained to be temperate,

00:34:53.233 --> 00:34:58.935
where you are trained how to control your
senses, how to control your attention.

00:34:59.136 --> 00:35:02.189
But there also what do we do?

00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:06.306
Let us find out, what do we do to control
our attention?

00:35:06.507 --> 00:35:09.121
Best thing is that when you go
to the ashram –

00:35:09.322 --> 00:35:14.868
take to the rigorous treatment of yourself,
absolutely rigorous treatment,

00:35:15.069 --> 00:35:17.950
“All right now we are in ashram,
let’s go all ahead”.

00:35:18.109 --> 00:35:20.848
Early in the morning you get up,
you do this, you do that,

00:35:21.049 --> 00:35:22.870
and you work it out in such a manner

00:35:23.071 --> 00:35:25.764
that you see to it that once you get out
of the ashram,

00:35:25.965 --> 00:35:29.172
you are absolutely perfected.
That should be the ashram.

00:35:29.373 --> 00:35:34.894
While it seems that in the ashram, if you
go, people get worse. Is most surprising.

00:35:35.101 --> 00:35:39.285
And even they told My husband.

00:35:39.486 --> 00:35:42.052
He said, “What, what sort of an ashram
you have

00:35:42.253 --> 00:35:46.316
that people go and catch in the ashram?
What sort of an ashram it is?”.

00:35:46.517 --> 00:35:52.015
The reason is, who are in the ashram
must maintain a certain discipline,

00:35:52.216 --> 00:35:56.433
and get up in the morning and not indulge
in too much tea taking.

00:35:56.634 --> 00:35:59.499
Everything must have a balance,
go on reducing.

00:35:59.700 --> 00:36:01.510
Everything you can go on reducing.

00:36:01.710 --> 00:36:04.169
See, if you can go on reducing your sugar
it will be nice.

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:08.118
I tell you how to give up tea, very easy.

00:36:08.319 --> 00:36:13.419
You first of all stop taking sugar –
half of you will leave taking.

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:19.204
Then you stop taking any milk in it –
then the other half will give up,

00:36:19.373 --> 00:36:23.125
and then you stop your tea. That’s how
it will work out.

00:36:23.326 --> 00:36:27.610
But one need not go to that extreme
that you just don’t have any tea.

00:36:27.787 --> 00:36:32.192
But also the other extreme is that, without
tea you cannot talk to each other,

00:36:32.393 --> 00:36:34.534
every time there should be a tea.

00:36:34.735 --> 00:36:38.120
Now, just now you have had no tea, nothing,
you have been sitting nicely.

00:36:38.321 --> 00:36:40.981
Since morning you have got up, you are
looking very fresh and nice,

00:36:41.182 --> 00:36:45.350
nobody is tired. But then, “I’m tired,
I must have tea”.

00:36:45.551 --> 00:36:48.131
All these things all work together.

00:36:48.332 --> 00:36:55.710
So one has to take a very, very pragmatic
attitude towards Sahaja Yoga,

00:36:55.911 --> 00:36:59.477
and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.

00:36:59.678 --> 00:37:03.529
Next year I will be 58 years of age.

00:37:03.730 --> 00:37:06.366
I don’t know if I’ll be in London
or wherever it is,

00:37:06.567 --> 00:37:10.030
or we may celebrate it in India.
All of us may go to India,

00:37:10.231 --> 00:37:14.704
but it won’t look nice if the Sahaja Yogis
from here come down with Me

00:37:14.905 --> 00:37:18.828
and there all the Sahaja Yogis there will
be shocked and look at you

00:37:19.029 --> 00:37:23.158
and say, “What is this? Why are you
like this? We can’t understand”,

00:37:23.359 --> 00:37:27.212
it won’t be nice. Now for next time
we are not going to do that.

00:37:27.413 --> 00:37:31.225
For next time we are going to go over
there, much cleaner, much better.

00:37:31.428 --> 00:37:35.590
Why not compete in this? Instead of Sloth,
why not compete?

00:37:35.790 --> 00:37:39.737
If he’s getting at four o’clock, why
not I get at least quarter to four?

00:37:39.938 --> 00:37:42.550
If, at least, five minutes to four.

00:37:42.751 --> 00:37:46.415
Let us try to compete in these things
and it will work out.

00:37:46.616 --> 00:37:49.760
If you want to do it, it is very easy
to do.

00:37:49.961 --> 00:37:54.787
But going to India and everybody saying
that, “London Sahaja Yogis, Oh God!

00:37:54.988 --> 00:37:57.968
What a headache, they are coming now,
we’ll have to clear them,

00:37:58.169 --> 00:37:59.990
this thing, that thing, all sorts
of things”.

00:38:00.191 --> 00:38:03.159
They have had very funny experiences
so far.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.531
For next time I would request you all

00:38:06.732 --> 00:38:10.144
to prepare yourself assiduously
for one year.

00:38:10.345 --> 00:38:12.630
Only try for one year, not more than that.

00:38:12.830 --> 00:38:15.909
If you have to study, say, medicine,
you have to study for seven years.

00:38:16.110 --> 00:38:19.662
Anything you have to do you have to study
for years together, you have done it now!

00:38:19.863 --> 00:38:25.434
So one year religiously you see to it
that you live in joy, happiness

00:38:25.635 --> 00:38:31.275
and friendship with others, and with
yourself in complete

00:38:31.476 --> 00:38:37.310
assiduity and rigorous imprisonment.
Then only it is going to work out.

00:38:37.511 --> 00:38:42.663
With others lot of love, lot
of friendship, sweetness.

00:38:42.864 --> 00:38:48.643
With yourself complete rigorous
imprisonment. If you have a temper,

00:38:48.844 --> 00:38:51.680
stand before the mirror and look
at yourself when you get angry –

00:38:51.881 --> 00:38:56.982
you’ll get rid of it, you see. Then,
all sorts of things can be cured.

00:38:57.183 --> 00:38:59.755
If you have any problem you ask Me,
I’ll tell you how to do it,

00:38:59.956 --> 00:39:03.518
how to puncture your ego, everything
I can tell you individually.

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:06.619
But you come out with these problems,
you say, “Mother, this is my problem,

00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:10.244
this is my problem. I don’t know,
I’m doing this, how to solve it?”

00:39:10.445 --> 00:39:13.630
and it will work out. But by condemning
yourself

00:39:13.831 --> 00:39:16.252
you are not going to work it out also.
This is another fashion is,

00:39:16.453 --> 00:39:20.086
“I’m so bad, I’m no good”, is a fashion.

00:39:20.287 --> 00:39:22.478
You are perfectly all right, nothing wrong
with you.

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:26.694
Only thing you have to work it out
and you have to come up.

00:39:26.895 --> 00:39:31.971
So from one year that is finishing
to the next year.

00:39:32.693 --> 00:39:38.324
We have to promise, we have to promise
on the day of Mataji’s birthday.

00:39:38.525 --> 00:39:44.419
You have given Me such nice, beautiful
things. I love them, such nice sayings.

00:39:44.620 --> 00:39:54.468
But I have to tell you that this time I am
giving you the discipline of Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:54.669 --> 00:39:59.876
Discipline yourself. Discipline is very
important.

00:40:00.103 --> 00:40:03.178
If you do not discipline yourself, any tree
which is not disciplined

00:40:03.379 --> 00:40:07.178
cannot grow properly. You have
to discipline yourself.

00:40:07.379 --> 00:40:10.795
If you do not want to discipline, only
thing you’ll be coming to My program

00:40:10.996 --> 00:40:15.122
and will be of no use to Me. You have
to develop your depth,

00:40:15.323 --> 00:40:20.200
you have to go deeper into it and it has
to be worked out.

00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:25.342
This year we are going to have lots
of other programs

00:40:25.543 --> 00:40:31.440
which I have already talked to other
people. You can find out from them.

00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:35.647
We are going to Paris, we are going
to Switzerland.

00:40:35.848 --> 00:40:40.001
We are going to America and you’ll have
lots of time.

00:40:40.202 --> 00:40:46.513
But even when you have no work, when
you are alone, you can work it out.

00:40:46.714 --> 00:40:51.199
Every moment you have to work it out.
This year you really dedicate,

00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:55.824
the year of dedication, for improving
yourself fully,

00:40:56.025 --> 00:41:03.670
working it out, meeting regularly
and doing it. Not only writing.

00:41:03.870 --> 00:41:06.696
For example in the committee meeting,
everybody’s there.

00:41:06.897 --> 00:41:10.070
Now you all discuss, write it down
in the paper, all right.

00:41:10.271 --> 00:41:14.339
“We have to do this, we have to do that,
we’ll all get up at four o’clock”

00:41:14.532 --> 00:41:21.091
and till six o’clock everybody’s snoring,
that sort of a thing is not going to help.

00:41:21.292 --> 00:41:28.287
So we have to work it out because this is
what is in store for us.

00:41:28.488 --> 00:41:34.155
It’s such a beautiful thing.
A little effort and what a joy,

00:41:34.356 --> 00:41:40.539
little effort and what a personality!
Little effort and what a power!

00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:48.120
Little effort and what a collective
strength!

00:41:48.874 --> 00:41:54.428
So a little effort, “Have I put in little
more than what I can put in?”

00:41:54.629 --> 00:41:58.436
And give up this idea of “I’m tired”.
Nobody’s going to get a heart attack,

00:41:58.637 --> 00:42:00.982
take it from Me.

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:06.529
Nobody’s heart is going to fail,
take it from Me.

00:42:06.735 --> 00:42:12.151
You have lots of energy, but put it
in the right channel.

00:42:12.352 --> 00:42:15.808
That is going to help all of us.

00:42:16.009 --> 00:42:20.472
Also I would like to have from you
suggestions.

00:42:20.702 --> 00:42:24.428
You sit down, talk to each other
for arranging other programs.

00:42:24.629 --> 00:42:28.454
I am going to Brighton also, we have fixed
those dates also for Brighton.

00:42:28.655 --> 00:42:33.149
But other places, wherever you want Me
to go. Say Edinburgh or any place.

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:36.716
I’m here May, June, July, like that
I’m here.

00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:39.656
We’ll fix it up, whenever you say
we will do it.

00:42:39.857 --> 00:42:43.382
But week days I can go, weekends is rather
difficult.

00:42:43.583 --> 00:42:47.330
We have already fixed Paris and this thing
for weekends.

00:42:47.531 --> 00:42:52.768
But weekends are difficult for Me because
I have another things to attend to.

00:42:52.969 --> 00:42:55.252
So now I am with you do whatever
you please.

00:42:55.453 --> 00:43:00.257
But first and foremost thing is that
you have to be absolutely all right.

00:43:00.458 --> 00:43:04.349
You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have
to know, you have to be experts.

00:43:04.550 --> 00:43:07.172
I have seen people who come only yesterday
became great experts

00:43:07.373 --> 00:43:12.566
while [those] who are slogging for seven
years are still [slogging].

00:43:12.859 --> 00:43:17.556
So we all have to work it that way and must
have faith in ourselves

00:43:17.757 --> 00:43:23.777
as I have faith in you. I have great faith
in you and I can see

00:43:23.978 --> 00:43:27.420
the beautiful time that we are going
to have together

00:43:27.621 --> 00:43:33.744
and really enjoy ourselves thoroughly.
Absolutely we are going to enjoy.

00:43:33.945 --> 00:43:38.784
You don’t have any frights, don’t take any

00:43:39.633 --> 00:43:44.073
steps which can spoil other people’s
temperaments.

00:43:44.274 --> 00:43:49.269
Either you are aggressive or
non-aggressive. But it is never so.

00:43:49.470 --> 00:43:53.417
If you are aggressive then you give up
aggression then you become a timid person.

00:43:53.618 --> 00:43:56.517
Timidness has no value in Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:56.718 --> 00:44:03.792
What is it am I going to do with timid
people – timid, tired, fagged out?

00:44:03.993 --> 00:44:07.574
If you are tired, take some tonic,
get well.

00:44:07.775 --> 00:44:12.116
All of you should get well, and see
that you really achieve

00:44:12.317 --> 00:44:16.742
that sparkling radiance within.

00:44:16.943 --> 00:44:21.478
You won’t believe that your Mother works
very hard.

00:44:21.679 --> 00:44:24.674
Very, very hard She has to work
with you people,

00:44:24.859 --> 00:44:28.972
and I have to really pull you through,
really pull you through.

00:44:29.173 --> 00:44:32.970
But still you find Me very happy

00:44:33.171 --> 00:44:41.696
because I see something that is so
beautiful, that is so nice,

00:44:41.897 --> 00:44:47.577
so sweet, so great in you, and whenever
I see that

00:44:47.778 --> 00:44:52.652
I just say, “This will all go away after
all, you see these are all dried leaves,

00:44:52.853 --> 00:44:56.645
they will have to go, autumn will
be over and spring will be coming."

00:44:56.846 --> 00:45:00.642
So you see, I forget it, and I just don’t
worry about

00:45:00.843 --> 00:45:03.247
how much I have worked, how much
I have to work out.

00:45:03.448 --> 00:45:07.851
But trust each other, love each other
and give more trust

00:45:08.052 --> 00:45:14.472
and more love and understanding
and no sympathy of any kind.

00:45:14.964 --> 00:45:17.890
So I don’t know how to thank you again
and again

00:45:18.091 --> 00:45:21.202
for making that function so successful.

00:45:21.403 --> 00:45:24.714
People are very happy about it and we are
going, we are looking forward

00:45:24.915 --> 00:45:27.398
to tomorrow’s program on the 24th

00:45:27.599 --> 00:45:32.389
and that is going to be really a very,
very heavy day for all of us.

00:45:32.590 --> 00:45:37.408
So after today’s this thing, you will know
that you are much better now.

00:45:37.609 --> 00:45:40.771
Keep it up. Put yourself into bandhan.

00:45:40.972 --> 00:45:45.921
Girdle up yourself, and “Onward Christian
soldiers”.

00:45:46.122 --> 00:45:50.059
This is what it is, we have to be
in that way.

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:54.118
We are the people who are loving.
We love.

00:45:54.319 --> 00:45:57.300
We distribute love. We emit love,

00:45:57.501 --> 00:46:01.973
and we have to be that picture and that
image that when people see they’ll say,

00:46:02.174 --> 00:46:06.445
“Oh these are the right type of people”.
We need not wear any dresses

00:46:06.646 --> 00:46:10.782
or anything like that, but only seeing you
people blooming like that

00:46:10.983 --> 00:46:13.296
people have to believe that you are
all great.

00:46:13.497 --> 00:46:18.979
You have already shown your great work in
that exhibition and people were enamored

00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:23.139
how you are so transformed and you are
so great.

00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:25.700
I mean, they were really enamored how
you did the whole job

00:46:25.901 --> 00:46:28.255
so well and so systematically.

00:46:28.456 --> 00:46:34.452
So again I have to remind, on this day that
we have to promise our Mother

00:46:34.653 --> 00:46:42.405
that, “Mother, this year we really promise
you we’ll work very hard.

00:46:42.814 --> 00:46:46.351
We’ll be very compassionate,
[full of] kindness."

00:46:46.552 --> 00:46:50.561
That’s not your right, that’s not the way
to do it, you see you should not laugh,

00:46:50.762 --> 00:46:55.324
that’s not good manners. Just try to see,
what is the person saying.

00:46:55.525 --> 00:46:58.392
Even if he’s stupid, no use laughing
at him.

00:46:58.593 --> 00:47:03.063
Just see what he’s saying,
what is his attitude,

00:47:03.264 --> 00:47:07.351
and all this will bring forth a very,
very beautiful image

00:47:07.552 --> 00:47:10.572
of all My children, whom I love very much.

00:47:10.773 --> 00:47:16.140
I will love and love and love. Whatever
may happen I’ll be your own.

00:47:16.351 --> 00:47:21.457
But still, in My love I request you that
I cannot feel happy

00:47:21.658 --> 00:47:25.842
unless and until I make you like Myself.
All right?

00:47:26.043 --> 00:47:28.015
Thank you very much.
