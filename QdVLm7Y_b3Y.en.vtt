00:00.761 --> 00:06.846
The birthday of Your Mother, and
all such celebrations

00:07.047 --> 00:10.625
have a very deep significance,

00:13.750 --> 00:22.368
because on such occasions, special
vibrations flow in the atmosphere.

00:23.193 --> 00:30.766
When all the celestial bodies,

00:32.965 --> 00:37.019
the Eternal Personalities,

00:37.673 --> 00:45.281
Gods and Goddesses sing the praise,

00:46.431 --> 00:54.673
and that’s how the whole atmosphere
is filled with mirth and happiness.

00:57.154 --> 01:04.920
Human beings also express their gratitude.

01:05.121 --> 01:12.573
The expression of gratitude
and love

01:13.550 --> 01:18.623
is done in different, different ways
in different countries,

01:18.824 --> 01:28.294
but the substance remains the same
and the forms change.

01:30.656 --> 01:40.265
The substance is like the ocean which flows

01:40.670 --> 01:47.641
continuously towards the shores

01:48.943 --> 01:53.787
and the ripples which touch the shores

01:53.988 --> 02:01.871
are again repelled back, and a nice
pattern is formed.

02:05.447 --> 02:12.073
It is such a spontaneous thing
and is so beautiful,

02:12.274 --> 02:16.225
creates such a beautiful pattern
in the atmosphere.

02:16.426 --> 02:22.965
All these waves when they weave together
the pattern of love

02:23.166 --> 02:28.617
they soothe human beings, they enchant
human beings

02:28.818 --> 02:32.347
and the whole thing is very blissful.

02:35.152 --> 02:43.059
On such occasions a special type
of feelings develop,

02:43.260 --> 02:47.784
which we cannot express in words

02:50.526 --> 02:56.650
so the expression could be in any form.

02:57.532 --> 03:05.586
But the main thing is the expression.
God has expressed Himself by Creation,

03:05.911 --> 03:09.259
by creating this Creation.

03:09.460 --> 03:13.024
While the Creation has to express
its gratitude

03:13.225 --> 03:20.786
by glorifying Him, and this play must
go on eternally.

03:20.987 --> 03:25.109
It’s the most beautiful play.

03:25.863 --> 03:33.313
Those who indulge into this play
lead an eternal life.

03:33.514 --> 03:39.323
That life is unending, never breaks

03:39.524 --> 03:45.639
and binds the whole universe with
its beautiful music.

03:52.538 --> 03:58.359
Today, specially, I have to speak to people

03:58.560 --> 04:05.582
who feel weak to follow Sahaja Yoga,

04:05.788 --> 04:12.852
who are fickle minded, those who
lack strength,

04:13.053 --> 04:22.502
those who are afraid of taking Sahaja
Yoga seriously.

04:24.187 --> 04:33.178
It is very important that fickle mindedness
must be seen clearly – why we are fickle.

04:33.742 --> 04:40.794
Mostly it might be the ego that
is stopping you

04:40.995 --> 04:46.808
from doing something that is very,
very important.

04:47.009 --> 04:54.772
The ficklemindedness comes to us by various
ways, as I said one of them is ego.

04:54.973 --> 04:59.881
A fickle minded person can be frightened
by his own ego

05:00.082 --> 05:08.072
and he may stop doing Sahaja Yoga
after going up to a point,

05:08.273 --> 05:13.214
because the ego might say now,
“Here forward, if you go,

05:13.415 --> 05:18.027
there is a tunnel in which you cannot
enter.

05:18.228 --> 05:23.964
You should not go any further.
It’s very dangerous."

05:24.808 --> 05:32.130
It could be marred by your Sloth. Sloth
is the curse of this country I feel.

05:32.479 --> 05:35.895
It’s the curse of the Sahaja Yoga also.

05:36.096 --> 05:39.538
I do not know if it is the curse
of the Western World

05:39.739 --> 05:50.675
but Sloth is something, is like a devil
that can keep you very much glued

05:51.817 --> 05:55.299
to your own positions and will
not allow you to move out.

05:55.500 --> 06:02.382
For example in the morning you get up
and you think that, “Oh, it’s all right,

06:02.583 --> 06:04.837
what’s the need to get up early
in the morning?

06:05.038 --> 06:09.192
There is no need to do any meditation.

06:10.981 --> 06:15.980
I’ll do it tomorrow”. Otherwise you start
thinking that,

06:16.181 --> 06:18.898
“It can be done after a month,
doesn’t matter,

06:19.099 --> 06:22.795
Mataji is here, everything will be
all right."

06:22.996 --> 06:28.456
But you must know that there are so many
imperfections within you,

06:28.657 --> 06:35.167
and if you do not meditate now, seriously,
take it up as a very serious thing,

06:35.368 --> 06:40.094
you may lag behind so much that
you may be dropped out.

06:40.295 --> 06:43.852
Meditation is very important
after Sahaja Yoga.

06:44.053 --> 06:49.432
You have slept and slept all your life.
Sleeping is not so important.

06:49.633 --> 06:53.247
You have to today promise Me that,
from tomorrow,

06:53.448 --> 06:59.411
you all are going to get up in the morning
and meditate.

07:00.415 --> 07:03.623
I was suggesting that if you take your
baths in the morning would be better,

07:03.824 --> 07:08.197
so that you won’t have your sleepy
condition.

07:08.398 --> 07:13.646
Sloth is such a devious thing that you do
not see it.

07:13.847 --> 07:17.042
It explains everything. If you say,
“Oh I am sick”

07:17.242 --> 07:21.471
it will say, “Oh you are so sick you should
go to the hospital”.

07:21.672 --> 07:25.644
If you say, “I’m tired” it will say,
“You are extremely tired”.

07:25.845 --> 07:31.439
Why should you be so tired? It is nothing
but your Sloth is telling you that,

07:31.640 --> 07:35.505
“You are extremely tired, you better
not do meditation

07:35.706 --> 07:39.905
now you are extremely tired. You better
take some rest, is important”.

07:40.106 --> 07:44.043
Sloth is worse than superego and ego.

07:44.244 --> 07:48.591
Is a kind of an inertia which pulls
you down,

07:48.792 --> 07:53.722
and that inertia you have to really
throw away and get out of it.

07:53.923 --> 07:59.869
Because it explains everything, you like
it, because it gives you little comfort,

08:00.070 --> 08:04.012
and you want to rely on your Sloth.

08:04.213 --> 08:08.839
But Krishna has said in Gita, that Sloth
is the worst thing

08:09.040 --> 08:12.502
that can happen to human beings.
If they take to Sloth,

08:12.703 --> 08:19.708
if they accept Sloth, they will have
all explanations for being Slothful.

08:19.909 --> 08:23.637
He, “Alasya”, He calls it, is the worst
disease according to Him,

08:23.838 --> 08:28.530
for any aspirant of spiritual life.

08:31.021 --> 08:35.186
You may think that, “You see, I’m not
well now”

08:35.387 --> 08:38.058
or anything, Sloth can give you
any ideas.

08:38.259 --> 08:42.212
Because I don’t have that so I don’t know
what ideas it gives you

08:42.413 --> 08:47.561
but it can give you any kind of idea
that would be very, very appealing to you

08:47.762 --> 08:50.498
because it knows how to please
your ego.

08:50.699 --> 08:57.227
Sloth is a ego-satisfying thing,
ego-pampering stuff,

08:57.428 --> 09:00.578
and it makes you feel that, “Oh you are
very tired”. What are you tired about?

09:00.779 --> 09:03.220
You are all young people, why should you
be tired?

09:03.420 --> 09:09.817
You get tired so soon, is nothing but
your Mr. Sloth telling you you are tired.

09:10.018 --> 09:15.984
You'll be surprised, after feeling tired
you'll run for two miles, you can run.

09:16.293 --> 09:24.820
Now why Sloth works Sahaja Yoga
so adversely?

09:25.021 --> 09:29.543
Why Sloth works out against Sahaja Yoga
so much?

09:29.744 --> 09:36.805
The reason is, because we are not yet
identified with our wellbeing.

09:37.006 --> 09:40.850
We do not think that “We have to be better,
we have to improve,

09:41.051 --> 09:45.212
we have to go further, there’s a big gap,
we have to do it”.

09:45.413 --> 09:50.945
We are not identified with our progress.
Supposing if I tell you, in England,

09:51.146 --> 09:56.110
that if you run two miles every day in
the morning, you will get a beauty prize,

09:56.311 --> 10:03.809
99.9% people, of women of this country,
would be running early in the morning.

10:04.010 --> 10:07.930
Supposing if somebody tells men

10:08.145 --> 10:14.112
that, “You will get Mr. Universe if you
run every day five miles in the morning”,

10:14.313 --> 10:20.533
there will be, I don’t know, 99.999%
people may be running like that,

10:20.734 --> 10:23.740
because we are identified with that kind
of a competition

10:23.940 --> 10:31.213
which is very materialistic, which is
of no value.

10:31.414 --> 10:36.292
But when you give up even that competition
you fall into another competition

10:36.506 --> 10:40.476
is everybody is competing each other
in Sloth.

10:40.677 --> 10:44.116
They will get up in the morning,
see around,

10:44.317 --> 10:47.607
“Now, Cooly’s still sleeping, all right,
let me sleep”.

10:47.807 --> 10:51.181
So Cooly will think, “He’s still sleeping,
let me sleep”.

10:51.382 --> 10:59.118
So there is a big competition on as to
who is going to wake up first,

10:59.319 --> 11:01.825
who is going to do this.

11:02.026 --> 11:07.259
And if somebody gets up then one starts
finding faults that, “He got up but what?

11:07.460 --> 11:10.105
He was just taking tea” or “He was
talking”.

11:10.306 --> 11:12.220
What about you? You were still in bed!

11:12.420 --> 11:16.391
At least he got up, was talking, doesn’t
matter. But he was kicking.

11:16.592 --> 11:21.107
What about you who was still slumbering
in the bed?

11:21.308 --> 11:25.360
Now it’s such a childlike thing, I mean,
it’s such a childish thing to talk about

11:25.560 --> 11:30.338
with such intellectuals as you are, such
well read and such well posted people.

11:30.539 --> 11:35.292
That doesn’t behove Me, a Mother
of such great people, to talk like this,

11:35.493 --> 11:40.951
but sometimes I find My Sahaja Yogis
are like two year old children,

11:41.152 --> 11:46.054
and then I have to tell them that,
“Now you are grown up”.

11:46.255 --> 11:50.005
You see, you can explain it

11:50.894 --> 11:56.534
but how are you going to explain yourself?

11:57.901 --> 12:04.894
Because if you have to grow, if you want
your tree to grow,

12:05.576 --> 12:09.707
you must change your priorities
and your identifications.

12:09.908 --> 12:16.664
If you have to be a first-class Sahaja
Yogi, you have to put your attention to it.

12:16.865 --> 12:23.779
I do not know how to fix it up.
Supposing we fix it up like this,

12:23.980 --> 12:29.145
it’s very childish but I have to tell you
because I have seen this is the problem,

12:29.346 --> 12:35.069
that, “The day I don’t get up, I’ll have
to pay 10 pee”, let’s keep it like that.

12:35.270 --> 12:39.975
If you are getting much more pay
then put it at ten pounds.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.836
But something like that. Or you can
say that,

12:43.037 --> 12:47.794
“That day I’ll give up one sweater
of mine”. Start it like that.

12:47.995 --> 12:51.882
It’s very easy. People will say that,
“No Mother, when I meditate,

12:52.083 --> 12:54.765
you know, something goes wrong with me” –
means you are wrong,

12:54.966 --> 12:59.958
there’s something wrong with you.
So you better sit down and meditate.

13:00.159 --> 13:07.497
Now, I must say, if you do not meditate,
you are very selfish.

13:07.698 --> 13:13.034
That’s the main point is. Because
when you come here,

13:13.235 --> 13:16.735
scorpions come out of you [Mother says “Me”
but obviously means “you”] to bite My feet.

13:16.936 --> 13:23.712
There are snakes coming out of you to bite
My feet. Do you want to do that to Me?

13:23.913 --> 13:26.398
Or else to others also.

13:26.599 --> 13:30.672
The other day somebody came to My house and
Chaya and all these people were there.

13:30.873 --> 13:35.386
He was so caught up that they were
reeling with giddiness,

13:35.587 --> 13:40.699
and everybody was trying to take it out
and work it out.

13:42.536 --> 13:49.140
If you want Sahaja Yoga to work out
in this country and in the West,

13:49.353 --> 13:54.375
we have to understand our own value,
and we must work it out.

13:54.576 --> 13:59.925
Every time if you are catching, every time
you meet Me you are catching,

14:00.126 --> 14:03.678
then how are you going to feel
the Kundalini?

14:03.879 --> 14:08.489
You must know how the Kundalini moves
within yourself.

14:08.690 --> 14:12.082
Say, where it is, how far it has gone.

14:12.283 --> 14:17.797
At least there should be at least
ten people like that, minimum,

14:17.998 --> 14:20.991
because I have worked here so hard.

14:21.205 --> 14:24.016
You don’t know, I didn’t work
so many years in India

14:24.217 --> 14:28.500
and there will be at least 80% people
who can feel the Kundalini moving –

14:28.701 --> 14:31.538
it is here, it is there, it is there.

14:31.739 --> 14:36.017
And some people feel over-satisfied
with their progress also.

14:36.218 --> 14:41.804
It is like a full group of people going
somewhere, say a tug-of-war.

14:42.005 --> 14:48.500
Even one person moves two steps forward
than where he is, the whole thing moves.

14:49.206 --> 14:53.754
But we do not see to the people who are
moving it towards them,

14:53.955 --> 15:01.138
what we always see is, “How can we compete
with the person who is not moving?

15:01.339 --> 15:07.354
If he is moving back two steps, we can
move back three steps."

15:07.656 --> 15:12.619
This kind of attitude will not help us.

15:12.820 --> 15:16.707
You know that Sahaja Yoga is the only way,

15:16.908 --> 15:23.782
is the only method that Divine Grace
has given you, by which

15:23.983 --> 15:29.682
you are going to transform the whole
world, and lazy lumps:

15:29.883 --> 15:36.789
how can they help Sahaja Yoga?
Laziness is the worst thing today.

15:36.990 --> 15:41.239
I know today is not a day to say all these
things, but you all have to promise to Me

15:41.440 --> 15:46.951
that you are going to give up your
laziness – Swaha.

15:47.152 --> 15:53.215
That’s what I have seen that, whenever
I meet you people you are caught up.

15:53.667 --> 16:01.507
The another thing which goes against Sahaja
Yoga is, I have told you hundred times,

16:01.708 --> 16:08.508
I don’t know how many times, is to talk ill
about other Sahaja Yogis.

16:08.709 --> 16:13.933
We are all part and parcel of one body, say
we are all part and parcel of one hand.

16:14.134 --> 16:21.125
Now if this finger starts talking ill about
this one, what is it going to do?

16:21.768 --> 16:27.057
Talking ill about each other is a very
wrong thing.

16:27.258 --> 16:33.877
So today also decide that, “We will never
talk ill about anybody else

16:34.078 --> 16:39.060
but we’ll look at ourselves – what is
our position."

16:39.549 --> 16:42.283
I’ve seen people passing remarks
about other people

16:42.484 --> 16:45.847
who themselves are very badly caught up,

16:47.228 --> 16:51.234
and not worried about themselves. Now,
by this, how are you going to improve?

16:51.435 --> 16:55.423
If you do not pay attention to yourself, and
pay attention to others you cannot improve.

16:55.624 --> 17:02.643
So another promise should be that, “We will
not talk ill about other Sahaja Yogis."

17:02.844 --> 17:08.062
But no Sahaja Yogi should take anything for
granted.

17:08.866 --> 17:12.536
We have to really work very hard.

17:15.002 --> 17:22.175
So second habit of talking ill about other
Sahaja Yogis should be Swaha,

17:22.376 --> 17:25.175
and thinking even about it.

17:25.376 --> 17:28.667
You are absolutely cutting the threads
of Sahaja Yoga,

17:28.868 --> 17:32.612
which I have very sweetly woven.

17:32.954 --> 17:36.868
Now you would be generous to Me, I know.
You can be very generous, you have given Me

17:37.069 --> 17:40.940
a very beautiful painting, I am
very thankful to you.

17:41.141 --> 17:45.696
But try to do it to others also –
generosity.

17:45.897 --> 17:50.429
You should be really bound together and you
can see then what we can produce.

17:50.629 --> 17:55.486
You have seen how nicely we did
the exhibition. Everybody was enamored.

17:55.687 --> 18:01.054
Everybody was very happy that you did
so well. It was such a joyous thing

18:01.255 --> 18:04.494
and everybody was congratulating,
they telephoned to Me.

18:04.695 --> 18:07.163
They said, “How they are together?

18:07.364 --> 18:11.096
There was no quarrel, no fighting, nothing.
They did it so well."

18:11.297 --> 18:16.189
So tell your mind that, “How dare you
think against any Sahaja Yogi”.

18:16.390 --> 18:20.891
Do you know all of you are saints
of the highest calibre?

18:21.092 --> 18:28.147
And this kind of wretched, nonsensical
thing, so low level, how can you do?

18:29.060 --> 18:32.915
I may talk ill about others,

18:33.158 --> 18:36.979
I may say that, “He’s bad”, just
to test you.

18:37.179 --> 18:43.276
So many times I do that to see how
you feel about someone.

18:44.284 --> 18:47.369
If I say somebody’s bad, just keep quiet.

18:47.570 --> 18:52.292
It will have two purposes. One will
be that,

18:52.493 --> 18:56.408
if you are sympathising with someone,
so I am saying, “Don’t sympathize”

18:56.609 --> 18:59.208
because you are sympathizing with
a wrong person.

18:59.409 --> 19:02.948
Or maybe I am just testing you.

19:03.149 --> 19:06.492
So keep it noted in your mind, if I say
that person is no good,

19:06.685 --> 19:11.370
then keep it in your mind, “Am I
sympathizing with that person?”

19:11.576 --> 19:15.834
This negative sympathy is very common.

19:16.035 --> 19:22.539
So third promise should be that we will
not sympathize.

19:22.740 --> 19:28.259
If you sympathize, ‘sym-pathize’ means
‘you share the pathos of others’.

19:28.460 --> 19:32.132
You have to just share the joy of another
person.

19:32.362 --> 19:36.693
So we will not sympathize with others,
with anyone,

19:36.894 --> 19:42.696
but we will share the joy of another
person.

19:43.038 --> 19:46.036
The part that is joy of another person,
we are going to share

19:46.237 --> 19:49.925
and look out for the joy. Try to see
the good points.

19:50.126 --> 19:53.701
Some people just cannot see.

19:55.375 --> 20:01.199
That’s how you dominate each other.
That’s a wrong thing.

20:01.400 --> 20:08.003
In a growth of vital importance it is
important to know,

20:08.204 --> 20:12.804
what are the vital parts. If you try
to press one vital part,

20:13.005 --> 20:19.450
you cannot grow also, because you are
all supported together.

20:19.903 --> 20:22.750
So the third thing is – you have to promise

20:22.956 --> 20:33.877
that you are not anymore going
to sympathize with anybody else.

20:35.441 --> 20:39.970
None of you can love as much as I can love.

20:41.555 --> 20:48.073
And then one should know that if you have
sympathies, there is no need at all.

20:48.274 --> 20:52.771
But you should have feelings for everyone.

20:54.995 --> 21:00.896
Now every human being has a character
and a temperament.

21:01.444 --> 21:06.728
Apart from his Self, is his Spirit which
is pure, in its own form,

21:06.929 --> 21:10.216
it just gives you vibrations, tells you
right, left and all that.

21:10.417 --> 21:13.017
But everybody has a character,
is important,

21:13.218 --> 21:18.463
because the light that is burning
in a candle can be different style,

21:18.664 --> 21:23.367
another different style. Looks nice,
variety looks nice, it gives you beauty.

21:23.568 --> 21:26.130
So your character you must know.

21:26.331 --> 21:31.568
Respect your character and enjoy
the character of another person.

21:31.769 --> 21:34.769
I really enjoy your characters

21:34.970 --> 21:38.103
and how sweetly you behave towards
your own characters.

21:38.304 --> 21:40.736
But temperament is not your Self.

21:40.937 --> 21:45.137
Temperaments you must give up.
Temperaments are horrid things.

21:45.338 --> 21:50.576
You give up your temperaments but keep
to your character.

21:50.777 --> 21:55.696
A character is something so great,
is something so sweet,

21:55.897 --> 22:01.309
and I see that character in a person,
and I feel like –

22:01.510 --> 22:05.497
how is it they are not identifying with
their character but with temperament?

22:05.698 --> 22:10.839
For supposing somebody has a temperament of
saying something silly – is a temperament.

22:11.039 --> 22:13.833
So you just say, “What is this going on?

22:14.034 --> 22:17.001
Why am I saying things silly?
I better get rid of it”.

22:17.202 --> 22:20.969
Somebody has a temperament of getting
boiled up very fast –

22:21.170 --> 22:25.559
so you see to it that this temperament
is not your character.

22:25.760 --> 22:31.003
But some people are so low level that even
in their character you can find

22:31.204 --> 22:35.346
something going on and on and on,
which is – their temperament has become

22:35.547 --> 22:38.592
one with their character.
So try to separate.

22:38.792 --> 22:43.801
First of all you separate yourself from
your temperament to your character,

22:43.971 --> 22:49.652
and in that character you enlighten
your light.

22:49.853 --> 22:54.856
See how beautiful you will be, you’ll enjoy
each other much more.

22:55.057 --> 23:00.375
Now when you are with Me, I know everything
about you, no doubt.

23:00.576 --> 23:05.078
Everything. In your mind, what’s going,
I read minds.

23:05.279 --> 23:10.524
I read everything, but what I see
is your light.

23:10.725 --> 23:16.839
Then what I see is your character. I do
not bother about your temperament,

23:17.040 --> 23:20.435
but a time comes when this temperament
becomes more dominant thing.

23:20.636 --> 23:23.676
You become so much identified with
[dominant], “I am like that!

23:23.877 --> 23:27.208
I am like that! What to do? I am like that!
It happens to me.

23:27.409 --> 23:32.805
I…I…I…I…I." So the fourth resolution
should be – No more “I”.

23:32.982 --> 23:39.093
We are not going to talk about “I”,
“I think”, “I believe”. Who are you?

23:39.294 --> 23:44.748
“I believe” – now who are you?
Are you Jesus Christ,

23:44.949 --> 23:50.206
that your beliefs and your faiths
are that great?

23:50.407 --> 23:56.326
So we should say, “We believe”,
“We are like that”.

23:56.527 --> 23:59.754
Now we have to move in one body,

23:59.955 --> 24:03.129
with all our different characters we have
to say “We”,

24:03.330 --> 24:07.592
“We which are part and parcel
of one personality."

24:07.793 --> 24:11.981
So always say “We”, and this is
how we must know

24:12.182 --> 24:17.287
that these temperaments are the things
which keeps us out from everyone.

24:17.488 --> 24:21.447
Temperaments can be – somebody is
a crying baby.

24:21.648 --> 24:23.843
Then that person will remain a crying baby

24:24.044 --> 24:27.604
for such a long time till I’ll break
My head.

24:27.805 --> 24:30.864
If somebody is a frightened person,
he’ll be always frightened like that.

24:31.065 --> 24:35.085
You say anything – frightened.
It’s useless.

24:35.286 --> 24:37.965
Why to be like that? You be normal.

24:38.166 --> 24:43.766
If you have that kind of a temperament
you be normal. Is not good.

24:43.967 --> 24:47.150
Some person is an aggressive person,
or a hot tempered person.

24:47.351 --> 24:50.573
He’ll be losing temper all the time.
That’s a temperament again,

24:50.774 --> 24:54.928
that’s not his character. Character shows
in small, small things.

24:55.129 --> 24:58.640
I’ll show you a character.

25:00.367 --> 25:05.161
Now a person has a character that
he’s very generous.

25:06.130 --> 25:11.626
He will say something which will be
very generous.

25:11.827 --> 25:15.222
A person who is a loving character,

25:15.423 --> 25:19.319
he will do something which will show
that he’s extremely loving.

25:19.520 --> 25:21.721
So you first find out what is your
character.

25:21.922 --> 25:26.004
Supposing you are a loving person,
then why not love each other?

25:26.205 --> 25:29.806
Why not talk of love? Why not be kind?

25:30.007 --> 25:33.629
We suppress that, and we take
our temperament as our own.

25:33.830 --> 25:35.928
And once you take your temperament
as your own,

25:36.129 --> 25:40.534
there are problems and problems and
problems. They are just like bubbles.

25:40.735 --> 25:45.794
These temperaments have no value,
no substance, useless.

25:45.995 --> 25:49.017
And they are the greatest joy killers.

25:49.218 --> 25:53.524
If you have one person who is
temperamental – [you’ve] had it.

25:53.725 --> 25:58.530
All of you will know that this person has
this temperament – they’ll run away.

25:58.731 --> 26:02.414
People have their own ways of doing things,

26:02.615 --> 26:08.135
that one has to merge, has to surrender
to The Whole.

26:08.336 --> 26:13.348
We must learn to surrender our own
little, little things to The Whole,

26:13.549 --> 26:17.682
and then you’ll be surprised that we
will become

26:17.883 --> 26:22.187
so congenial, so integrated – despite
our different characters.

26:22.388 --> 26:25.897
You have to maintain your different
character, different style of talking,

26:26.098 --> 26:29.473
different style of walking, different style
of expression.

26:29.674 --> 26:33.926
But the character, if it is not brought
forward,

26:34.127 --> 26:37.568
the whole thing is so ugly so horrid.

26:37.769 --> 26:46.283
Like the stinking, rotting leaves
these days.

26:47.180 --> 26:53.537
But if you remove the leaves, these
old leaves, these useless leaves,

26:53.738 --> 26:57.781
then you find the beautiful grass below.

26:58.704 --> 27:02.201
So nobody should identify with your
temperament.

27:02.402 --> 27:06.226
That is very important for Sahaja Yoga.

27:06.427 --> 27:09.638
You must know that people are going
to come to Sahaja Yoga

27:09.807 --> 27:13.926
because of you not because of Me.

27:14.127 --> 27:17.608
They cannot understand Me.
I am beyond them.

27:17.809 --> 27:21.798
I say something of the seventh floor.
They just don’t understand.

27:21.999 --> 27:25.650
They will understand you, not Me.

27:25.851 --> 27:29.418
This is very important, perhaps you people
do not realize.

27:29.619 --> 27:32.905
You are not, supposing, taking Sahaja Yoga
seriously,

27:33.106 --> 27:36.726
you are not doing anything about it.
You are still very much attached to things.

27:36.927 --> 27:39.575
You are not willing to do this, you are
not willing to do that,

27:39.776 --> 27:41.693
you don’t want to give up this or that.

27:41.894 --> 27:46.610
Then people will say, “Oh he’s a Sahaj
Yogi, such a person. How can he be?

27:46.811 --> 27:49.233
What has he achieved?” You may say,
“I’ve got the Bliss,

27:49.434 --> 27:53.348
Mother has given me the Bliss”, they’ll
say, “Not, we cant see that in your face”.

27:53.549 --> 27:57.200
You are still criticizing each other.
Still you think no end of yourself,

27:57.401 --> 28:00.300
still you are catching here and there.

28:00.501 --> 28:07.515
So it is you, you are the reflection
of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

28:08.388 --> 28:11.120
They will know, they will see, “All right,
She is all right”.

28:11.321 --> 28:14.270
I have seen people who are My relations,
they will say, “Oh You are Beyond.

28:14.471 --> 28:17.222
Nobody can reach You and so we are
not going to try."

28:17.423 --> 28:19.911
But if they see there are some people
have reached somewhere,

28:20.112 --> 28:23.783
then they will come. Isn’t it?
So you are like people,

28:23.984 --> 28:28.086
say I’m placed on the seventh floor and you
are placed on the first floor, all of you.

28:28.287 --> 28:30.880
Then you come to the third floor then
people start seeing.

28:31.080 --> 28:33.560
The first floor people cannot see
the seventh floor,

28:33.761 --> 28:36.340
but if you are there at least
on the third floor they say,

28:36.541 --> 28:39.207
“Oh there are some people on the third
floor, let’s go ahead!”

28:39.408 --> 28:46.741
It is like that, because people see

28:46.955 --> 28:52.678
what they can see, they cannot see
what they cannot see.

28:52.879 --> 28:58.332
So when they see transformation in you,
they see that beauty in you,

28:58.533 --> 29:02.423
then they know that there is Sahaja Yoga.

29:02.624 --> 29:07.557
So for Sahaja Yoga’s sake we have
to sacrifice certain things

29:07.758 --> 29:10.874
and I have told you already that we have
to sacrifice

29:11.075 --> 29:15.968
all the funny habits or temperaments
we have got,

29:16.169 --> 29:19.634
that today you have to decide that,
“I’ll give up this”,

29:19.835 --> 29:24.623
and it is, today, as I told you, there are
special blessings, it will work out.

29:24.824 --> 29:27.773
You have to become really good
Sahaja Yogis.

29:27.974 --> 29:31.834
Now by comparing with each other
you cannot.

29:33.123 --> 29:36.281
By talking to each other you cannot.
It is your own,

29:36.482 --> 29:40.112
it is you who has to certify
“Am I all right?

29:40.313 --> 29:42.599
Am I a good Sahaja Yogi? Am I really
progressing?”.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.216
You must progress, if you do not progress
then you are not growing.

29:46.417 --> 29:50.927
All of you have to grow, and grow and grow.

29:51.800 --> 29:58.083
So the last of all is the day when
we are very happy.

29:58.284 --> 30:02.853
Now this is the first time My birthday
is celebrated in London,

30:03.054 --> 30:10.913
first time abroad, and all the Indian
Sahaja Yogis must be pining for Me.

30:11.114 --> 30:15.366
I am sure, all over, they must be terribly
pining for Me,

30:15.567 --> 30:18.629
so we have to think about them also.

30:18.830 --> 30:23.077
Think about other Sahaja Yogis, what they
must be doing.

30:23.278 --> 30:28.916
Think about them – you will feel happy.
You sit down and think about others

30:29.117 --> 30:32.539
and you’ll feel very happy thinking
about those people

30:32.739 --> 30:36.856
because they also are your brothers
and sisters.

30:37.057 --> 30:41.021
And so nice it is to feel that you have
so many brothers and sisters

30:41.222 --> 30:45.775
who speak the same language.
So we have to transcend

30:45.976 --> 30:50.594
that limitation that we are in England –
no, we are everywhere,

30:50.832 --> 30:55.663
and you can in your meditation, think
of all these people who are there.

30:55.864 --> 31:00.966
Establish your relationships with them.
Establish your understanding with them.

31:01.167 --> 31:04.128
You write to them. As we have got
pen-friends,

31:04.329 --> 31:09.018
you can get some pen-friendship and
you can start writing to people.

31:09.219 --> 31:12.821
It will be a very good idea if you start
something like that.

31:13.022 --> 31:18.807
But letter writing is another thing
which is Sloth, completely.

31:19.008 --> 31:22.242
You see I write much...
(Interruption in the audio)

31:22.443 --> 31:26.224
(...) who has limited money, he
sits down makes a budget.

31:26.425 --> 31:29.883
In the same way you make the budget
of your timing.

31:30.084 --> 31:33.914
You are always busy – doing what?

31:34.842 --> 31:38.033
So let us find out that time, that time

31:38.234 --> 31:44.325
when you have to allow yourself to grow,
that time which is required

31:44.526 --> 31:50.527
for your personal attention, which is
required for your evolution,

31:50.728 --> 31:55.813
that you must give. That is the due
you have to pay

31:56.014 --> 32:01.602
because you are realized souls now
and the responsibility is your own.

32:01.803 --> 32:05.915
In this, best thing is to take to wisdom.

32:06.116 --> 32:09.503
Sit down once and take to wisdom
and think it over,

32:09.704 --> 32:12.022
“Mataji has given us realization,
all right.

32:12.223 --> 32:15.557
The germination has started, all right.
Where are we?

32:15.758 --> 32:19.281
How far are we? Have we got even
our roots or not?

32:19.482 --> 32:24.094
Have you got the shoots coming out or not?
Where are we?”

32:24.295 --> 32:26.368
Just find out for yourself.

32:26.569 --> 32:29.046
I know that Mataji is pulling all of you

32:29.247 --> 32:33.411
and you are all dragged into it. You have
to be jolly well going, moving somewhere,

32:33.612 --> 32:37.477
but if you give your motivating force,
all of you.

32:37.678 --> 32:40.742
Not even one person should drag behind,
because his weight

32:40.943 --> 32:46.862
is going to pull us back isn’t it?
So that’s why I say it is selfish.

32:47.063 --> 32:50.947
If anybody lags behind, that weight we have
to pull again.

32:51.148 --> 32:55.266
So what happens, it’s like the story that
a person who walks

32:55.467 --> 32:59.615
three steps forward and five steps
backwards. When will he reach?

32:59.816 --> 33:03.070
He’ll never reach. When will he reach?

33:03.271 --> 33:06.980
Such a question, you see it is, as they
asked in the mathematics, you see,

33:07.181 --> 33:12.074
“When will he reach?” Such people who
move backwards faster than the forwards.

33:12.275 --> 33:17.833
So everybody must decide that, “I am moving
backwards, I must move forwards."

33:18.034 --> 33:24.931
By that you are helping the whole grow, and
will be the ideal thing for Sahaja Yoga.

33:25.132 --> 33:27.315
So your individual growth should be
all right,

33:27.516 --> 33:31.289
and your collective growth should
be all right. It takes not much.

33:31.489 --> 33:35.275
Meditation you have to do. You have
to sit in Nirvichara.

33:35.481 --> 33:39.520
You have to give up your thinking. Try
to be in Nirvichar, try to be in Nirvichar,

33:39.721 --> 33:43.655
and you will be surprised how the thing
will flower out.

33:43.856 --> 33:49.295
Next year I want to see many more people
to come.

33:49.496 --> 33:53.379
Apart from that I also want to see
everybody progressing.

33:53.580 --> 33:57.168
You see even if you get thousands of people
and of no quality what’s the use?

33:57.369 --> 33:59.687
What are we going to do with them?

33:59.888 --> 34:05.172
We have to have people of quality, people
who will work it out, who will get to it.

34:05.373 --> 34:12.402
Who are identified but are not working
it out is useless.

34:13.302 --> 34:18.914
So everyone must work it out, must
work hard.

34:19.115 --> 34:21.960
Do not criticize others, do not sympathize,

34:22.161 --> 34:26.370
and go further and further with
your progress.

34:26.561 --> 34:29.477
The other day I was finding out the meaning
of the word ‘Ashram’,

34:29.678 --> 34:34.067
means ‘a place for the ascetics to live’.

34:36.530 --> 34:42.370
Ashram is a place, if you have to go there,
don’t carry all your luggage there.

34:42.570 --> 34:44.532
You have to take very few things there.

34:44.733 --> 34:47.944
You should be able to live with two, three
clothes in an ashram.

34:48.145 --> 34:53.033
You see, Ashram is a place where you are
trained to be temperate,

34:53.233 --> 34:58.935
where you are trained how to control your
senses, how to control your attention.

34:59.136 --> 35:02.189
But there also what do we do?

35:02.390 --> 35:06.306
Let us find out, what do we do to control
our attention?

35:06.507 --> 35:09.121
Best thing is that when you go
to the ashram –

35:09.322 --> 35:14.868
take to the rigorous treatment of yourself,
absolutely rigorous treatment,

35:15.069 --> 35:17.950
“All right now we are in ashram,
let’s go all ahead”.

35:18.109 --> 35:20.848
Early in the morning you get up,
you do this, you do that,

35:21.049 --> 35:22.870
and you work it out in such a manner

35:23.071 --> 35:25.764
that you see to it that once you get out
of the ashram,

35:25.965 --> 35:29.172
you are absolutely perfected.
That should be the ashram.

35:29.373 --> 35:34.894
While it seems that in the ashram, if you
go, people get worse. Is most surprising.

35:35.101 --> 35:39.285
And even they told My husband.

35:39.486 --> 35:42.052
He said, “What, what sort of an ashram
you have

35:42.253 --> 35:46.316
that people go and catch in the ashram?
What sort of an ashram it is?”.

35:46.517 --> 35:52.015
The reason is, who are in the ashram
must maintain a certain discipline,

35:52.216 --> 35:56.433
and get up in the morning and not indulge
in too much tea taking.

35:56.634 --> 35:59.499
Everything must have a balance,
go on reducing.

35:59.700 --> 36:01.510
Everything you can go on reducing.

36:01.710 --> 36:04.169
See, if you can go on reducing your sugar
it will be nice.

36:04.370 --> 36:08.118
I tell you how to give up tea, very easy.

36:08.319 --> 36:13.419
You first of all stop taking sugar –
half of you will leave taking.

36:13.620 --> 36:19.204
Then you stop taking any milk in it –
then the other half will give up,

36:19.373 --> 36:23.125
and then you stop your tea. That’s how
it will work out.

36:23.326 --> 36:27.610
But one need not go to that extreme
that you just don’t have any tea.

36:27.787 --> 36:32.192
But also the other extreme is that, without
tea you cannot talk to each other,

36:32.393 --> 36:34.534
every time there should be a tea.

36:34.735 --> 36:38.120
Now, just now you have had no tea, nothing,
you have been sitting nicely.

36:38.321 --> 36:40.981
Since morning you have got up, you are
looking very fresh and nice,

36:41.182 --> 36:45.350
nobody is tired. But then, “I’m tired,
I must have tea”.

36:45.551 --> 36:48.131
All these things all work together.

36:48.332 --> 36:55.710
So one has to take a very, very pragmatic
attitude towards Sahaja Yoga,

36:55.911 --> 36:59.477
and Sahaja Yoga related to ourselves.

36:59.678 --> 37:03.529
Next year I will be 58 years of age.

37:03.730 --> 37:06.366
I don’t know if I’ll be in London
or wherever it is,

37:06.567 --> 37:10.030
or we may celebrate it in India.
All of us may go to India,

37:10.231 --> 37:14.704
but it won’t look nice if the Sahaja Yogis
from here come down with Me

37:14.905 --> 37:18.828
and there all the Sahaja Yogis there will
be shocked and look at you

37:19.029 --> 37:23.158
and say, “What is this? Why are you
like this? We can’t understand”,

37:23.359 --> 37:27.212
it won’t be nice. Now for next time
we are not going to do that.

37:27.413 --> 37:31.225
For next time we are going to go over
there, much cleaner, much better.

37:31.428 --> 37:35.590
Why not compete in this? Instead of Sloth,
why not compete?

37:35.790 --> 37:39.737
If he’s getting at four o’clock, why
not I get at least quarter to four?

37:39.938 --> 37:42.550
If, at least, five minutes to four.

37:42.751 --> 37:46.415
Let us try to compete in these things
and it will work out.

37:46.616 --> 37:49.760
If you want to do it, it is very easy
to do.

37:49.961 --> 37:54.787
But going to India and everybody saying
that, “London Sahaja Yogis, Oh God!

37:54.988 --> 37:57.968
What a headache, they are coming now,
we’ll have to clear them,

37:58.169 --> 37:59.990
this thing, that thing, all sorts
of things”.

38:00.191 --> 38:03.159
They have had very funny experiences
so far.

38:03.360 --> 38:06.531
For next time I would request you all

38:06.732 --> 38:10.144
to prepare yourself assiduously
for one year.

38:10.345 --> 38:12.630
Only try for one year, not more than that.

38:12.830 --> 38:15.909
If you have to study, say, medicine,
you have to study for seven years.

38:16.110 --> 38:19.662
Anything you have to do you have to study
for years together, you have done it now!

38:19.863 --> 38:25.434
So one year religiously you see to it
that you live in joy, happiness

38:25.635 --> 38:31.275
and friendship with others, and with
yourself in complete

38:31.476 --> 38:37.310
assiduity and rigorous imprisonment.
Then only it is going to work out.

38:37.511 --> 38:42.663
With others lot of love, lot
of friendship, sweetness.

38:42.864 --> 38:48.643
With yourself complete rigorous
imprisonment. If you have a temper,

38:48.844 --> 38:51.680
stand before the mirror and look
at yourself when you get angry –

38:51.881 --> 38:56.982
you’ll get rid of it, you see. Then,
all sorts of things can be cured.

38:57.183 --> 38:59.755
If you have any problem you ask Me,
I’ll tell you how to do it,

38:59.956 --> 39:03.518
how to puncture your ego, everything
I can tell you individually.

39:03.719 --> 39:06.619
But you come out with these problems,
you say, “Mother, this is my problem,

39:06.820 --> 39:10.244
this is my problem. I don’t know,
I’m doing this, how to solve it?”

39:10.445 --> 39:13.630
and it will work out. But by condemning
yourself

39:13.831 --> 39:16.252
you are not going to work it out also.
This is another fashion is,

39:16.453 --> 39:20.086
“I’m so bad, I’m no good”, is a fashion.

39:20.287 --> 39:22.478
You are perfectly all right, nothing wrong
with you.

39:22.679 --> 39:26.694
Only thing you have to work it out
and you have to come up.

39:26.895 --> 39:31.971
So from one year that is finishing
to the next year.

39:32.693 --> 39:38.324
We have to promise, we have to promise
on the day of Mataji’s birthday.

39:38.525 --> 39:44.419
You have given Me such nice, beautiful
things. I love them, such nice sayings.

39:44.620 --> 39:54.468
But I have to tell you that this time I am
giving you the discipline of Sahaja Yoga.

39:54.669 --> 39:59.876
Discipline yourself. Discipline is very
important.

40:00.103 --> 40:03.178
If you do not discipline yourself, any tree
which is not disciplined

40:03.379 --> 40:07.178
cannot grow properly. You have
to discipline yourself.

40:07.379 --> 40:10.795
If you do not want to discipline, only
thing you’ll be coming to My program

40:10.996 --> 40:15.122
and will be of no use to Me. You have
to develop your depth,

40:15.323 --> 40:20.200
you have to go deeper into it and it has
to be worked out.

40:20.400 --> 40:25.342
This year we are going to have lots
of other programs

40:25.543 --> 40:31.440
which I have already talked to other
people. You can find out from them.

40:31.640 --> 40:35.647
We are going to Paris, we are going
to Switzerland.

40:35.848 --> 40:40.001
We are going to America and you’ll have
lots of time.

40:40.202 --> 40:46.513
But even when you have no work, when
you are alone, you can work it out.

40:46.714 --> 40:51.199
Every moment you have to work it out.
This year you really dedicate,

40:51.400 --> 40:55.824
the year of dedication, for improving
yourself fully,

40:56.025 --> 41:03.670
working it out, meeting regularly
and doing it. Not only writing.

41:03.870 --> 41:06.696
For example in the committee meeting,
everybody’s there.

41:06.897 --> 41:10.070
Now you all discuss, write it down
in the paper, all right.

41:10.271 --> 41:14.339
“We have to do this, we have to do that,
we’ll all get up at four o’clock”

41:14.532 --> 41:21.091
and till six o’clock everybody’s snoring,
that sort of a thing is not going to help.

41:21.292 --> 41:28.287
So we have to work it out because this is
what is in store for us.

41:28.488 --> 41:34.155
It’s such a beautiful thing.
A little effort and what a joy,

41:34.356 --> 41:40.539
little effort and what a personality!
Little effort and what a power!

41:40.740 --> 41:48.120
Little effort and what a collective
strength!

41:48.874 --> 41:54.428
So a little effort, “Have I put in little
more than what I can put in?”

41:54.629 --> 41:58.436
And give up this idea of “I’m tired”.
Nobody’s going to get a heart attack,

41:58.637 --> 42:00.982
take it from Me.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.529
Nobody’s heart is going to fail,
take it from Me.

42:06.735 --> 42:12.151
You have lots of energy, but put it
in the right channel.

42:12.352 --> 42:15.808
That is going to help all of us.

42:16.009 --> 42:20.472
Also I would like to have from you
suggestions.

42:20.702 --> 42:24.428
You sit down, talk to each other
for arranging other programs.

42:24.629 --> 42:28.454
I am going to Brighton also, we have fixed
those dates also for Brighton.

42:28.655 --> 42:33.149
But other places, wherever you want Me
to go. Say Edinburgh or any place.

42:33.350 --> 42:36.716
I’m here May, June, July, like that
I’m here.

42:36.917 --> 42:39.656
We’ll fix it up, whenever you say
we will do it.

42:39.857 --> 42:43.382
But week days I can go, weekends is rather
difficult.

42:43.583 --> 42:47.330
We have already fixed Paris and this thing
for weekends.

42:47.531 --> 42:52.768
But weekends are difficult for Me because
I have another things to attend to.

42:52.969 --> 42:55.252
So now I am with you do whatever
you please.

42:55.453 --> 43:00.257
But first and foremost thing is that
you have to be absolutely all right.

43:00.458 --> 43:04.349
You have to learn Sahaja Yoga, you have
to know, you have to be experts.

43:04.550 --> 43:07.172
I have seen people who come only yesterday
became great experts

43:07.373 --> 43:12.566
while [those] who are slogging for seven
years are still [slogging].

43:12.859 --> 43:17.556
So we all have to work it that way and must
have faith in ourselves

43:17.757 --> 43:23.777
as I have faith in you. I have great faith
in you and I can see

43:23.978 --> 43:27.420
the beautiful time that we are going
to have together

43:27.621 --> 43:33.744
and really enjoy ourselves thoroughly.
Absolutely we are going to enjoy.

43:33.945 --> 43:38.784
You don’t have any frights, don’t take any

43:39.633 --> 43:44.073
steps which can spoil other people’s
temperaments.

43:44.274 --> 43:49.269
Either you are aggressive or
non-aggressive. But it is never so.

43:49.470 --> 43:53.417
If you are aggressive then you give up
aggression then you become a timid person.

43:53.618 --> 43:56.517
Timidness has no value in Sahaja Yoga.

43:56.718 --> 44:03.792
What is it am I going to do with timid
people – timid, tired, fagged out?

44:03.993 --> 44:07.574
If you are tired, take some tonic,
get well.

44:07.775 --> 44:12.116
All of you should get well, and see
that you really achieve

44:12.317 --> 44:16.742
that sparkling radiance within.

44:16.943 --> 44:21.478
You won’t believe that your Mother works
very hard.

44:21.679 --> 44:24.674
Very, very hard She has to work
with you people,

44:24.859 --> 44:28.972
and I have to really pull you through,
really pull you through.

44:29.173 --> 44:32.970
But still you find Me very happy

44:33.171 --> 44:41.696
because I see something that is so
beautiful, that is so nice,

44:41.897 --> 44:47.577
so sweet, so great in you, and whenever
I see that

44:47.778 --> 44:52.652
I just say, “This will all go away after
all, you see these are all dried leaves,

44:52.853 --> 44:56.645
they will have to go, autumn will
be over and spring will be coming."

44:56.846 --> 45:00.642
So you see, I forget it, and I just don’t
worry about

45:00.843 --> 45:03.247
how much I have worked, how much
I have to work out.

45:03.448 --> 45:07.851
But trust each other, love each other
and give more trust

45:08.052 --> 45:14.472
and more love and understanding
and no sympathy of any kind.

45:14.964 --> 45:17.890
So I don’t know how to thank you again
and again

45:18.091 --> 45:21.202
for making that function so successful.

45:21.403 --> 45:24.714
People are very happy about it and we are
going, we are looking forward

45:24.915 --> 45:27.398
to tomorrow’s program on the 24th

45:27.599 --> 45:32.389
and that is going to be really a very,
very heavy day for all of us.

45:32.590 --> 45:37.408
So after today’s this thing, you will know
that you are much better now.

45:37.609 --> 45:40.771
Keep it up. Put yourself into bandhan.

45:40.972 --> 45:45.921
Girdle up yourself, and “Onward Christian
soldiers”.

45:46.122 --> 45:50.059
This is what it is, we have to be
in that way.

45:50.260 --> 45:54.118
We are the people who are loving.
We love.

45:54.319 --> 45:57.300
We distribute love. We emit love,

45:57.501 --> 46:01.973
and we have to be that picture and that
image that when people see they’ll say,

46:02.174 --> 46:06.445
“Oh these are the right type of people”.
We need not wear any dresses

46:06.646 --> 46:10.782
or anything like that, but only seeing you
people blooming like that

46:10.983 --> 46:13.296
people have to believe that you are
all great.

46:13.497 --> 46:18.979
You have already shown your great work in
that exhibition and people were enamored

46:19.180 --> 46:23.139
how you are so transformed and you are
so great.

46:23.340 --> 46:25.700
I mean, they were really enamored how
you did the whole job

46:25.901 --> 46:28.255
so well and so systematically.

46:28.456 --> 46:34.452
So again I have to remind, on this day that
we have to promise our Mother

46:34.653 --> 46:42.405
that, “Mother, this year we really promise
you we’ll work very hard.

46:42.814 --> 46:46.351
We’ll be very compassionate,
[full of] kindness."

46:46.552 --> 46:50.561
That’s not your right, that’s not the way
to do it, you see you should not laugh,

46:50.762 --> 46:55.324
that’s not good manners. Just try to see,
what is the person saying.

46:55.525 --> 46:58.392
Even if he’s stupid, no use laughing
at him.

46:58.593 --> 47:03.063
Just see what he’s saying,
what is his attitude,

47:03.264 --> 47:07.351
and all this will bring forth a very,
very beautiful image

47:07.552 --> 47:10.572
of all My children, whom I love very much.

47:10.773 --> 47:16.140
I will love and love and love. Whatever
may happen I’ll be your own.

47:16.351 --> 47:21.457
But still, in My love I request you that
I cannot feel happy

47:21.658 --> 47:25.842
unless and until I make you like Myself.
All right?

47:26.043 --> 47:28.015
Thank you very much.
