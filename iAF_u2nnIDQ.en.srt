1
00:00:57,857 --> 00:01:01,531
Today, you are all celebrating my birthday.

2
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:08,730
This is a matter of great satisfaction,

3
00:01:09,256 --> 00:01:13,736
as in this time of Kaliyuga, who celebrates the birthday of mother?

4
00:01:14,981 --> 00:01:18,693
This shows that though you all are

5
00:01:20,436 --> 00:01:22,865
born in this Kaliyuga,

6
00:01:23,452 --> 00:01:28,178
you don’t just know about your duty towards the mother,

7
00:01:28,631 --> 00:01:31,654
but you also follow it.

8
00:01:36,192 --> 00:01:37,168
At this age,

9
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:41,379
To celebrate birthdays means, a year is getting deducted every year.

10
00:01:42,972 --> 00:01:46,543
and there are so many tasks still to be done.

11
00:01:47,464 --> 00:01:52,583
I can see many tasks,, which are incomplete

12
00:01:52,978 --> 00:01:55,549
We will have to work hard and pay attention to them,

13
00:01:55,716 --> 00:01:57,849
only then can they be completed.

14
00:02:05,215 --> 00:02:07,873
Like I said yesterday, in Delhi,

15
00:02:09,366 --> 00:02:13,519
we should pay attention to our culture.

16
00:02:14,717 --> 00:02:18,534
We should sort out our cultural state also.

17
00:02:20,553 --> 00:02:24,394
and the third thing which is very important,

18
00:02:25,045 --> 00:02:26,132
is that

19
00:02:26,509 --> 00:02:30,382
towards our spiritual ascent, we

20
00:02:33,567 --> 00:02:36,599
should pay not just the attention but as a

21
00:02:38,544 --> 00:02:45,302
martyr who is ready to sacrifice his life for his cause,

22
00:02:45,453 --> 00:02:50,810
same fervour we should have for the Sahaja Yoga.

23
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:56,499
Until we have this sentiment within us,

24
00:02:56,729 --> 00:02:59,657
Sahaja Yoga is going to be only for our benefit.

25
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:04,077
What are our benefts, what kind of happiness we got from this,

26
00:03:04,609 --> 00:03:07,513
is what I keep hearing all the time.

27
00:03:09,432 --> 00:03:12,868
Whatever we have benefited from it,

28
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,275
whatever good has happened,

29
00:03:17,358 --> 00:03:24,112
is because of the only reason – that we have found your spirit.

30
00:03:24,655 --> 00:03:29,718
But when the light has come in you, you have become the lamp,

31
00:03:30,469 --> 00:03:33,445
then you can’t hide the lamp somewhere.

32
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,542
You should bring your lamp out.

33
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:43,471
And Sahaja yog, as I have said many times, is society-facing.

34
00:03:43,845 --> 00:03:46,917
Facing towards the society- that is Sahaja Yoga.

35
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,942
The light that can’t be spread, is of no use.

36
00:03:52,952 --> 00:03:55,198
So every Sahaj yogi should think,

37
00:03:55,492 --> 00:04:02,261
"how and in which dimension or style have I spread Sahaja Yoga".

38
00:04:03,572 --> 00:04:06,905
Firstly, a sort of speciality should enter your personality.

39
00:04:08,076 --> 00:04:13,253
And on attaining this speciality, I have enlightened so many people.

40
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:21,351
Today, when you embark on any task, in any country,

41
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:25,456
the first question arises about the state of the people there.

42
00:04:26,067 --> 00:04:29,852
What are their vices, what are their conditionings,

43
00:04:30,171 --> 00:04:33,631
how much ego do they have? that is measured first.

44
00:04:34,275 --> 00:04:37,782
Then the consideration comes if this work can be achieved or not.

45
00:04:37,846 --> 00:04:40,321
The biggest problem is the human being.

46
00:04:40,805 --> 00:04:43,559
Even if the number of people is huge,

47
00:04:44,256 --> 00:04:48,608
if their state is not good, then no task can be  completed properly.

48
00:04:50,165 --> 00:04:52,832
Sahaja Yoga has done this greatest task,

49
00:04:53,046 --> 00:04:57,530
of transforming human beings, has changed humen so much.

50
00:04:58,795 --> 00:05:00,866
it has brought forth their ascent.

51
00:05:01,152 --> 00:05:06,381
Today, Sahaj yogis are honest, truthful, hard-working people.

52
00:05:06,779 --> 00:05:10,691
the kind of people which are very difficult to find in this country.

53
00:05:12,247 --> 00:05:16,048
Very rare type of people, who do what they say,

54
00:05:17,505 --> 00:05:20,512
They think what they know.

55
00:05:21,653 --> 00:05:24,534
Sahaj yoga has readied such rare type of people

56
00:05:24,852 --> 00:05:29,970
In this respect, Sahaj yoga is a massive blessing on this country.

57
00:05:31,404 --> 00:05:35,731
However, if you have these fine people,

58
00:05:36,462 --> 00:05:39,628
like a talented artisan, who is without any work,

59
00:05:39,700 --> 00:05:41,766
then this talent goes to waste.

60
00:05:43,003 --> 00:05:48,550
So, every Sahaj yogi has to think about "how I can use my talent".

61
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:56,923
But, he also first thinks of his physical troubles and comfort

62
00:06:01,133 --> 00:06:03,696
Or he thinks how I can-

63
00:06:04,046 --> 00:06:06,053
I may have to spend money on this.

64
00:06:06,205 --> 00:06:09,879
or the expenditure may increase, how to manage that?

65
00:06:11,894 --> 00:06:15,973
In reality, you can not purchase joy, you can only experience it.

66
00:06:16,757 --> 00:06:20,384
But, whatever we obtain,

67
00:06:21,074 --> 00:06:26,582
or accept and adopt, get joy from it within us,

68
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:33,381
is different and Sahaj Yoga is different.

69
00:06:35,691 --> 00:06:41,050
You get the joy here only by sharing it and there is no other way.

70
00:06:42,459 --> 00:06:46,117
For that you may have to bear some troubles

71
00:06:46,607 --> 00:06:48,487
face some problems,

72
00:06:48,655 --> 00:06:52,937
but they don’t seem like troubles because your spirit gets satisfied.

73
00:06:53,152 --> 00:06:55,802
Bodily comforts don’t matter to you anymore.

74
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:58,307
You have to test yourself

75
00:06:58,736 --> 00:07:01,260
that when you become the spirit,

76
00:07:01,348 --> 00:07:05,427
when you share this light of the spirit with others,

77
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,189
then you go beyond bodily comforts.

78
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:13,541
You get so much joy of the spirit

79
00:07:13,809 --> 00:07:16,546
that in that joy of spirit,

80
00:07:18,071 --> 00:07:20,388
you get immersed completely.

81
00:07:21,072 --> 00:07:22,928
"Atmani atmana tushtah".

82
00:07:23,564 --> 00:07:25,738
spirit gets satisfied only by the spirit

83
00:07:25,818 --> 00:07:28,551
and does not require any other satisfaction.

84
00:07:29,056 --> 00:07:31,119
He doesn’t look for anything else.

85
00:07:31,215 --> 00:07:36,040
He gets so satisfied that He feels he’s drunk ambrosia.

86
00:07:36,957 --> 00:07:40,925
After having ambrosia, there is no need to have anything else.

87
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,761
when you get this state,

88
00:07:43,913 --> 00:07:46,246
then you should know that you have become a Sahaj yogi,

89
00:07:46,357 --> 00:07:48,357
else you are still incomplete.

90
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,589
Now You all know that I have become old

91
00:07:52,692 --> 00:07:56,550
and I have worked hard for 14 years tirelessly.

92
00:07:56,677 --> 00:07:59,700
You can say my penance is now complete.

93
00:08:00,225 --> 00:08:03,662
But, these last twelve years of hard work has been too much.

94
00:08:03,925 --> 00:08:08,213
It seems the hard work will have to continue for another 12 years.

95
00:08:08,942 --> 00:08:12,363
But, you have to see how much hard work you are putting in.

96
00:08:12,728 --> 00:08:15,595
Your mind will find one excuse or the other

97
00:08:15,752 --> 00:08:18,942
– that it can’t be done, I have my family,

98
00:08:19,173 --> 00:08:23,980
my children, my house, my this, my that.

99
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:29,897
But, beyond all these things is the universe of joy.

100
00:08:29,993 --> 00:08:33,756
If you want to achieve that, then you should know that

101
00:08:33,852 --> 00:08:37,281
you have to fulfil the desire of your spirit.

102
00:08:37,968 --> 00:08:40,896
Until you don’t fulfil the desires of your spirit,

103
00:08:41,227 --> 00:08:43,544
all your desires will stay as they are

104
00:08:43,655 --> 00:08:45,727
and all your tasks will stay as they are.

105
00:08:45,933 --> 00:08:47,449
You can’t achieve anything,

106
00:08:47,584 --> 00:08:50,679
especially welfare, unless your yoga is fully established.

107
00:08:50,862 --> 00:08:55,921
But, as soon as your yoga takes place and gets established,

108
00:08:56,024 --> 00:08:59,335
you will notice that all your problems will be solved instantly.

109
00:08:59,463 --> 00:09:01,996
your problems have been solved, right?

110
00:09:02,558 --> 00:09:04,129
All of yours have!

111
00:09:04,747 --> 00:09:09,318
Then you move forward and see whtever we think is a problem for us,

112
00:09:09,763 --> 00:09:13,333
we think is very difficult for us,

113
00:09:14,214 --> 00:09:18,512
instead you just think "we are involved in the work of Sahaj yoga,

114
00:09:19,116 --> 00:09:21,383
and God is going to look after us,

115
00:09:22,277 --> 00:09:23,523
then you will find that

116
00:09:23,626 --> 00:09:28,856
all that you consider as problems will all disappear altogether.

117
00:09:30,088 --> 00:09:33,842
I told you once before that the Kundalini,

118
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:42,871
remains beyond any cause and effect.

119
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:46,311
And, When you rise in your Kundalini, then

120
00:09:46,779 --> 00:09:49,532
the cause gets omitted, as does the effect.

121
00:09:49,627 --> 00:09:52,912
When the cause is not there, effect also is not there.

122
00:09:53,670 --> 00:09:56,099
You have witnessed it.

123
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:58,956
Many of you know that these things happen all the time.

124
00:09:59,251 --> 00:10:00,282
And it is happening.

125
00:10:00,354 --> 00:10:04,401
We’ve got the things we never imagined,

126
00:10:04,473 --> 00:10:06,222
we have achieved it.

127
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:10,516
we have got so much happiness, we have got everything in Sahaj yoga,

128
00:10:10,867 --> 00:10:15,358
And even then if we are troubled about small-small things,

129
00:10:16,693 --> 00:10:18,978
then it will become a difficult situation.

130
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:22,253
We should now think

131
00:10:22,468 --> 00:10:28,198
that we have found so much happiness, comfort and security

132
00:10:28,365 --> 00:10:29,587
and this Sahaj Yoga

133
00:10:29,754 --> 00:10:33,095
when we give to others, they can also achieve these things.

134
00:10:33,365 --> 00:10:37,341
But, when we give it to others, then we get more of it ourselves.

135
00:10:37,885 --> 00:10:42,511
There are many thousand messengers of God, at work for us.

136
00:10:44,877 --> 00:10:50,837
There are crores of hands, crores of their powers behind you all.

137
00:10:50,949 --> 00:10:54,639
If one person stands up to do the work of Sahaj Yoga,

138
00:10:54,776 --> 00:10:57,438
then you will not realise how things will happen,

139
00:10:57,494 --> 00:10:59,350
how things will get arranged,

140
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:02,702
no one knows how things happen, but it will happen.

141
00:11:03,437 --> 00:11:05,683
But, first, you have to prepare yourself.

142
00:11:05,953 --> 00:11:10,818
because the deities which are inside you, know what you are?

143
00:11:11,564 --> 00:11:14,072
whether you are truthful or fake

144
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:19,295
How high or low you are, they know everything.

145
00:11:19,974 --> 00:11:25,775
And until they are sure that you are fully dedicated,

146
00:11:26,267 --> 00:11:27,735
they will not help you.

147
00:11:28,134 --> 00:11:35,745
Once they know that you haven’t come just for your selfish reasons,

148
00:11:35,857 --> 00:11:40,269
but have come to do Sahaj yoga- which is society- facing-

149
00:11:40,918 --> 00:11:42,655
you have come to spread it,

150
00:11:42,854 --> 00:11:44,762
then you will be surprised that

151
00:11:44,866 --> 00:11:48,056
that you will be showered with blessings from all four directions,

152
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:52,315
– like the whole atmosphere will become fragrant

153
00:11:52,395 --> 00:11:54,134
and you will feel light

154
00:11:54,302 --> 00:11:57,035
as if " I have no weight on my shoulders" everything is happening,

155
00:11:59,072 --> 00:12:02,008
and everything gets organised by itself.

156
00:12:03,626 --> 00:12:06,665
We have to come to that state.

157
00:12:07,086 --> 00:12:11,424
Then you can see every person can do a lot of work and spread Sahaja.

158
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:17,954
I know that in Delhi, we still have to work a lot individually,

159
00:12:19,304 --> 00:12:21,113
and then collectively.

160
00:12:22,071 --> 00:12:23,023
It’s possible

161
00:12:23,087 --> 00:12:27,119
for you all to talk to your neighbours and relatives about it.

162
00:12:27,436 --> 00:12:29,443
You can call them all and tell them.

163
00:12:29,674 --> 00:12:33,157
In India we have a very nice arrangement where we have our children,

164
00:12:33,245 --> 00:12:36,045
our relatives, and acquaintances.

165
00:12:36,269 --> 00:12:37,982
we can talk to all of them about it.

166
00:12:38,047 --> 00:12:40,896
It is possible, among them Only a handful may believe in it.

167
00:12:41,055 --> 00:12:45,658
But, when they will see how your state and realise the change in you,

168
00:12:45,869 --> 00:12:48,138
then they will definitely make an effort.

169
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:49,495
At least some will.

170
00:12:49,615 --> 00:12:53,646
In this manner, you can help spread Sahaj yoga.

171
00:12:54,451 --> 00:12:58,035
Every person, whether it’s a woman or a man or a child,

172
00:12:58,163 --> 00:13:01,694
every person when enlightened,

173
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:05,375
has a right to establish in Yoga,

174
00:13:05,463 --> 00:13:09,463
but, it is their duty to give this light to others.

175
00:13:10,162 --> 00:13:13,034
You have the power and everything

176
00:13:13,176 --> 00:13:15,397
and if even then you didn’t give yoga to others,

177
00:13:15,525 --> 00:13:19,746
then I can’t say how appropriate that would be.

178
00:13:25,331 --> 00:13:29,129
In our Delhi centre,

179
00:13:29,667 --> 00:13:34,373
many questions have arisen about which I would like to talk.

180
00:13:34,495 --> 00:13:37,003
I will tell these people the problems we have

181
00:13:37,106 --> 00:13:41,784
and how you can obtain

182
00:13:44,054 --> 00:13:45,680
the solutions to these questions.

183
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,133
It’s not a difficult task.

184
00:13:47,272 --> 00:13:50,382
However, what we think from our mind

185
00:13:50,486 --> 00:13:55,406
and any decisions we take based on our opinions,

186
00:13:55,579 --> 00:13:58,521
still, until we

187
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,982
haven’t won over our Hamsa chakra and haven’t got the discretion,

188
00:14:02,062 --> 00:14:04,595
until we develop descretion within us,

189
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:13,797
until we have the power to know what is right and wrong,

190
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,567
anything we know what is beneficial for Sahaj yoga,

191
00:14:18,774 --> 00:14:23,559
until we develop the subtlity within us, to understand this,

192
00:14:23,751 --> 00:14:27,394
until then you haven’t completely achieved Sahaj yoga.

193
00:14:28,244 --> 00:14:30,395
How does that wisdom come?

194
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:31,522
Some ask, how do you get it?

195
00:14:31,641 --> 00:14:34,887
How do you know you can ride a cycle? when you can actually ride it.

196
00:14:35,715 --> 00:14:38,643
How do you drive a motor car? When you start driving it!

197
00:14:38,937 --> 00:14:42,984
Similarly how does subtle intelligence come? Just when it comes!

198
00:14:45,431 --> 00:14:47,979
How does it come? By being indifferent to it.

199
00:14:48,265 --> 00:14:51,280
You start watching everything in a witness state, meditate,

200
00:14:51,436 --> 00:14:57,388
and spend your time thinking about Sahaj yoga, then it will come.

201
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,622
But, how will it come, when will it happen?

202
00:15:01,932 --> 00:15:04,146
It will happen when it does happen.

203
00:15:04,885 --> 00:15:08,178
And if this hasn’t developed inside us yet,

204
00:15:08,298 --> 00:15:10,703
then we should try to achieve it.

205
00:15:10,791 --> 00:15:14,250
That’s why I said that now we should try really hard.

206
00:15:14,974 --> 00:15:16,656
We should try really hard.

207
00:15:17,057 --> 00:15:20,216
I had told them to invite only those people to the puja,

208
00:15:20,335 --> 00:15:23,303
who have actually achieved something, and

209
00:15:25,512 --> 00:15:31,681
(okay, wait, wait, now who ever has sent him, what do they understand? he is a child,)

210
00:15:32,103 --> 00:15:34,703
Anyone capable of achieving something,

211
00:15:35,038 --> 00:15:37,752
to give them is your paramount duty.

212
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:43,085
On every birthday, you make some or other new resolution.

213
00:15:46,468 --> 00:15:51,397
Now, I understand that I should also make a new resolution.

214
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:57,400
And the new resolution is that

215
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:01,719
the Vishwa Dharma that We have made,

216
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:05,758
the universal religion that We have established,

217
00:16:06,369 --> 00:16:07,809
and we all follow it,

218
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:12,215
if whoever doesn’t follow its ‘Maryada’ (boundaries),

219
00:16:12,446 --> 00:16:14,708
such a person have no right to be called a Sahaj yogi.

220
00:16:14,859 --> 00:16:18,382
This is what I thought that we should all resolve.

221
00:16:20,573 --> 00:16:25,469
Anyone who follows its Maryada, only he/she can be its follower.

222
00:16:25,947 --> 00:16:29,653
Any follower of Vishwa dharma, who doesn’t live by it,

223
00:16:29,978 --> 00:16:32,637
then we can’t accept him/her as a Sahaj yogi.

224
00:16:32,856 --> 00:16:36,855
For example, if a person is Sahaja Yogi, and he takes dowry,

225
00:16:37,395 --> 00:16:39,372
then he can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

226
00:16:39,541 --> 00:16:43,398
Anyone believing in the caste system, can’t be a Sahaj yogi.

227
00:16:43,755 --> 00:16:47,223
Any person believing in class system can not be a SahajaYogi.

228
00:16:47,376 --> 00:16:51,598
So, Today I have decided that from today any person,

229
00:16:52,269 --> 00:16:54,173
who calls himself a Sahaj yogi,

230
00:16:54,269 --> 00:16:57,959
should have a complete understanding of Vishwa Dharma.

231
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:03,261
Not only this, but if it doesn’t reflect in their behaviour,

232
00:17:03,347 --> 00:17:06,140
Supposing any sahaja Yogi behaves this way,

233
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:08,849
then he has no right to be in Sahaj Yoga.

234
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,008
He should be told that he should atone for his mistakes,

235
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:15,224
and correct himself as part of their atonement,

236
00:17:15,446 --> 00:17:17,913
only then he can come to Sahaja Yoga.

237
00:17:18,756 --> 00:17:22,779
There is no problem if people say only fewer people are left.

238
00:17:23,565 --> 00:17:26,303
There is very less space left in God’s kingdom.

239
00:17:26,557 --> 00:17:28,097
You don’t know.

240
00:17:29,154 --> 00:17:32,021
How many people can you accommodate there?

241
00:17:32,646 --> 00:17:35,289
Even hell doesn’t have enough space.

242
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:42,069
People will have to be kept somewhere in between only.

243
00:17:45,682 --> 00:17:48,777
That’s why, half baked people,

244
00:17:50,153 --> 00:17:52,417
who are good for nothing,

245
00:17:52,671 --> 00:17:55,012
shouldn’t come to Sahaj Yoga.

246
00:17:57,043 --> 00:17:59,423
There is no need to trouble us.

247
00:18:00,694 --> 00:18:04,440
People who come to Sahaj should follow it's protocol,

248
00:18:04,956 --> 00:18:08,831
and instil them in their behaviour, practice them,

249
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:13,568
Tell your neighbours completely about it

250
00:18:13,873 --> 00:18:17,095
and say that we believe in universal religion,

251
00:18:17,468 --> 00:18:19,730
and not in any other religion.

252
00:18:21,135 --> 00:18:24,507
If yogis don’t say that then we can’t accept them as yogis.

253
00:18:24,675 --> 00:18:28,549
people who are scared to tell people in their society that

254
00:18:28,867 --> 00:18:30,934
they are Yogis of Vishwa Dharma,

255
00:18:31,232 --> 00:18:34,880
people who are afraid to tell that they are Sahaja Yogis,

256
00:18:35,663 --> 00:18:38,647
Sahaja Yoga is not available for such people.

257
00:18:39,323 --> 00:18:43,799
You will have to fully follow the protocols of Sahaj yoga.

258
00:18:44,369 --> 00:18:45,988
Like, many people are there

259
00:18:46,123 --> 00:18:50,044
who tell that that ‘Mother, we sometimes drink a little alcohol,

260
00:18:50,637 --> 00:18:53,835
smoke a little, consume tobacco also’,

261
00:18:54,264 --> 00:18:56,331
Then you can not be a Sahaj yogi.

262
00:18:56,659 --> 00:19:01,198
If a person doesn’t follow the Maryada of Sahaj yoga,

263
00:19:01,460 --> 00:19:03,655
then he can not follow a universal religion.

264
00:19:03,853 --> 00:19:05,987
And this Universal relegion of ours,

265
00:19:06,376 --> 00:19:10,439
we must keep completely pure as it’s not just a universal religion,

266
00:19:10,663 --> 00:19:12,639
but Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

267
00:19:12,758 --> 00:19:15,646
I can’t allow any impurity to creep in,

268
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:18,694
That’s why anyone impure, can’t come into it.

269
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:26,007
Only those people who have fully accepted this universal religion

270
00:19:26,176 --> 00:19:28,310
and follow the protocol can stay in it.

271
00:19:28,628 --> 00:19:32,786
This is the resolution I have made for my birthday

272
00:19:32,929 --> 00:19:37,211
and I hope you will accept it with love.

273
00:19:40,871 --> 00:19:44,455
Now, about the specialities of this universal religion,

274
00:19:45,153 --> 00:19:48,827
how should it be and what is its depth-

275
00:19:49,010 --> 00:19:51,416
– all this, I will tell you on some other day.

276
00:19:51,782 --> 00:19:58,139
But, for now, you mustn’t do things that you roughly know to be wrong,

277
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:00,598
Things

278
00:20:02,455 --> 00:20:05,224
even in the normal light,

279
00:20:05,367 --> 00:20:12,682
if you can see that, is not Sahaj, that thing you cannot do.

280
00:20:13,776 --> 00:20:17,633
And If you can’t get rid of these things, then you must spare Me.

281
00:20:18,268 --> 00:20:19,788
I can’t fight you.

282
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:23,703
I have seen many people come just to get cured.

283
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:27,768
Then they will come with the second disease, then the third.

284
00:20:27,967 --> 00:20:31,109
The reason is after being cured once, you should become Sahaj.

285
00:20:31,269 --> 00:20:34,863
If you don’t become Sahaj, and after that you become a-Sahaj,

286
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,996
then you become ill yet again.

287
00:20:37,624 --> 00:20:38,965
Again you become sick.

288
00:20:39,092 --> 00:20:42,752
Do I keep washing you like a washerman the whole life?

289
00:20:44,356 --> 00:20:46,935
So, you should also keep yourself pure,

290
00:20:47,063 --> 00:20:50,853
and should follow this religion like it’s our ornament,

291
00:20:50,996 --> 00:20:54,218
this is our glory, our speciality,

292
00:20:54,329 --> 00:20:58,059
This is why we are sitting in a high pedestal in the world.

293
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,764
Every part of our body should have this thought.

294
00:21:02,471 --> 00:21:05,050
From each core of body the vibrations flow.

295
00:21:05,185 --> 00:21:10,353
You should understand that God is so eager to decorate you with this,

296
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:13,457
But, how aware you are about it,

297
00:21:13,648 --> 00:21:17,560
and how much you are ready for this, you should know.

298
00:21:19,769 --> 00:21:22,975
I tell you as much as I can.

299
00:21:23,263 --> 00:21:25,493
Now, the yardstick is

300
00:21:25,612 --> 00:21:29,064
that unless you follow the religion of Sahaj yoga,

301
00:21:29,251 --> 00:21:33,814
you can’t enter Sahaja Yoga and you don’t have a right to pujas.

302
00:21:35,852 --> 00:21:38,003
and you will have no right to anything else.

303
00:21:38,203 --> 00:21:43,123
Whoever stays in the Maryada, only will have this right.

304
00:21:43,226 --> 00:21:46,387
We might have only 4-5 people left, but doesn’t matter.

305
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,035
That will make things easier.

306
00:21:51,872 --> 00:21:54,761
You should be very aware towards this,

307
00:21:54,865 --> 00:22:00,076
make your life such that you all are together

308
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:04,600
and attain the meaning of your self, and be with one another.

309
00:22:04,884 --> 00:22:07,439
And with that, you should become capable.

310
00:22:07,662 --> 00:22:13,098
This is my blessing to you that you all should realise your powers

311
00:22:13,455 --> 00:22:17,375
and then nourish the whole world with this power of love.

312
00:22:23,924 --> 00:22:27,599
Since, today is my birthday, the puja will not be a long one.

313
00:22:27,917 --> 00:22:29,413
A simple puja is going to happen,

314
00:22:29,509 --> 00:22:32,503
first of all, with names of shri Ganesha My feet will be washed,

315
00:22:32,647 --> 00:22:34,342
and with that nectar of the feet will be made. (charanamrit)

316
00:22:34,462 --> 00:22:37,541
After that My feet will be washed with water,

317
00:22:37,833 --> 00:22:39,992
and that water will be theerth.(Holy water)

318
00:22:40,087 --> 00:22:43,126
And after that I will prepare the charanamrit using My hands,

319
00:22:43,556 --> 00:22:47,029
and at that time 108 names of Devi will be taken.

320
00:22:47,101 --> 00:22:50,060
That's it. There will not be much puja.

321
00:22:52,436 --> 00:22:55,602
Does everybody has the 108 names?

322
00:22:57,754 --> 00:22:58,483
Ganesha's name?

323
00:22:58,659 --> 00:23:01,684
No, no. Devi's name.

324
00:23:01,796 --> 00:23:04,319
Devi;s name. Distribute 108 names .

325
00:23:06,549 --> 00:23:07,033
What?

326
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,586
You have it but do others have it?

327
00:23:10,877 --> 00:23:12,567
Does Everybody have it?

328
00:23:13,875 --> 00:23:16,478
Have you got printed?

329
00:23:19,545 --> 00:23:21,745
But now, they don't have that now, just now.

330
00:23:24,247 --> 00:23:27,722
Okay now, among the 108 names,

331
00:23:27,921 --> 00:23:29,722
He will tell you the first name,

332
00:23:29,921 --> 00:23:32,655
then you convert it intio mantra and say.

333
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:37,309
Then you convert it into mantra and say.
