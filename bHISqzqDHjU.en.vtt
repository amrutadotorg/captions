WEBVTT

06:15.625 --> 06:23.458
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

06:26.999 --> 06:35.208
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

06:35.542 --> 06:40.667
is a very, very important deity within us

06:41.999 --> 06:45.583
because He is the Vishnu,

06:46.125 --> 06:50.792
who resides in the Void,

06:52.959 --> 06:55.542
in the Nabhi.

06:56.083 --> 07:03.333
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

07:03.792 --> 07:07.583
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

07:07.959 --> 07:10.208
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

07:10.667 --> 07:15.625
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

07:16.083 --> 07:18.125
You just did it

07:18.583 --> 07:24.834
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

07:25.709 --> 07:28.000
He is in the Void

07:28.458 --> 07:32.542
and if He is awakened

07:33.417 --> 07:40.667
He brings you to the light,

07:41.417 --> 07:44.583
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

07:45.000 --> 07:49.083
and you start seeing that

07:50.375 --> 07:54.458
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

07:54.999 --> 07:59.667
and that’s how the dharma is established.

08:00.000 --> 08:03.750
Of course, the Dharma was established also

08:04.208 --> 08:10.375
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

08:10.709 --> 08:15.041
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

08:24.500 --> 08:29.208
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

08:29.583 --> 08:33.000
and the ten Gurus

08:33.417 --> 08:38.834
is to establish Dharma within us.

08:39.208 --> 08:42.166
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

08:42.542 --> 08:44.250
as you have seen everywhere.

08:44.583 --> 08:48.041
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

08:48.458 --> 08:50.834
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

08:51.208 --> 08:57.208
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

08:57.959 --> 09:02.041
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

09:02.500 --> 09:06.583
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

09:07.000 --> 09:15.291
But Shri Krishna is the one

09:15.709 --> 09:21.375
who says that “I come on this earth

09:21.834 --> 09:31.834
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

09:33.208 --> 09:35.458
When the Dharma becomes weak

09:35.875 --> 09:38.208
then He comes on this Earth,

09:38.709 --> 09:41.417
and then He destroys the people

09:41.834 --> 09:47.041
who are responsible

09:47.792 --> 09:56.500
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

09:57.583 --> 10:00.500
The second thing He says, that

10:00.959 --> 10:06.125
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

10:07.500 --> 10:15.333
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

10:15.750 --> 10:17.333
who are destructive.”

10:17.709 --> 10:19.375
These are His promises

10:19.792 --> 10:24.250
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

10:24.667 --> 10:29.458
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

10:29.875 --> 10:33.792
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

10:34.291 --> 10:38.000
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

10:38.417 --> 10:40.500
when He came as Shri Krishna.

10:40.959 --> 10:44.083
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

10:44.542 --> 10:47.458
could not be expressed in that way.

10:49.542 --> 10:52.750
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

10:53.125 --> 10:55.500
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

10:55.959 --> 11:03.625
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

11:04.125 --> 11:08.083
as He made it,

11:08.542 --> 11:11.750
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

11:12.083 --> 11:16.959
the one who said that you become a witness;

11:18.583 --> 11:21.875
you witness the whole world like a drama,

11:22.250 --> 11:23.542
Sakshi Swarupa.

11:23.917 --> 11:30.583
And then once you see the whole world as just

11:31.083 --> 11:38.250
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

11:38.667 --> 11:40.000
That has happened to you people

11:40.375 --> 11:45.458
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

11:45.834 --> 11:47.542
the way you are enjoying yourself,

11:47.917 --> 11:53.250
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

11:53.667 --> 11:56.542
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

11:56.917 --> 11:59.208
by killing Putana and other people,

11:59.667 --> 12:06.500
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

12:06.875 --> 12:12.750
He is the one who will definitely protect

12:13.083 --> 12:17.375
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

12:17.917 --> 12:22.709
But later on He becomes the king,

12:23.125 --> 12:26.250
and when He becomes the king

12:26.625 --> 12:30.999
He uses His powers in a different way.

12:31.333 --> 12:35.417
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

12:35.750 --> 12:39.250
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

12:39.709 --> 12:41.792
and was such a bad man.

12:42.208 --> 12:46.458
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

12:46.875 --> 12:49.083
He killed so many people.

12:49.542 --> 12:53.208
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

12:53.667 --> 13:00.959
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

13:01.417 --> 13:09.000
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

13:09.458 --> 13:14.999
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

13:15.375 --> 13:19.208
He did not believe in forgiveness.

13:19.709 --> 13:24.792
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

13:25.250 --> 13:28.500
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

13:28.917 --> 13:30.625
If you are like Shiva,

13:31.000 --> 13:33.834
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

13:34.250 --> 13:38.875
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

13:39.250 --> 13:45.875
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

13:46.709 --> 13:50.792
because it was important that there should be

13:51.083 --> 13:53.333
somebody with a very stern mind,

13:53.750 --> 13:57.583
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

13:57.917 --> 14:01.417
and devil must be killed.

14:04.667 --> 14:07.375
He has done in His lifetime,

14:07.750 --> 14:10.750
if you see, killing of so many people.

14:11.083 --> 14:13.583
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

14:13.917 --> 14:16.792
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

14:17.333 --> 14:21.291
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

14:21.709 --> 14:25.333
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

14:25.750 --> 14:34.041
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

14:36.041 --> 14:37.667
He takes over.

14:37.999 --> 14:40.959
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

14:41.250 --> 14:44.250
because He does not forgive.

14:44.834 --> 14:49.500
He will immediately take over from you

14:50.000 --> 14:53.959
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

14:54.250 --> 15:00.000
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

15:00.375 --> 15:03.291
who are destroying the dharma.

15:05.125 --> 15:06.917
Now it is very surprising

15:07.208 --> 15:10.959
that whatever is preached by the person,

15:11.333 --> 15:15.709
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

15:16.125 --> 15:18.667
Is very surprising.

15:19.125 --> 15:24.000
Like we said that Christ said,

15:24.291 --> 15:26.458
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

15:26.834 --> 15:30.709
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

15:31.333 --> 15:37.750
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

15:39.000 --> 15:42.000
everybody has the spirit.

15:42.417 --> 15:47.250
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

15:47.750 --> 15:51.250
and fight with each other.

15:52.166 --> 15:57.875
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

15:58.291 --> 16:00.999
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

16:01.375 --> 16:03.959
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

16:04.291 --> 16:06.917
said about rahmat, means compassion.

16:07.250 --> 16:09.000
But you don’t find it anywhere.

16:09.458 --> 16:11.041
He has not said about shariat,

16:11.417 --> 16:12.792
He has not said of many things

16:13.125 --> 16:17.291
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.083
He never said that women should cover their face

16:20.458 --> 16:22.667
or cover their heads,

16:23.041 --> 16:26.542
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

16:26.959 --> 16:32.458
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

16:32.834 --> 16:37.166
just the opposite of that people try to do.

16:39.709 --> 16:44.542
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

16:45.000 --> 16:50.625
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

16:51.083 --> 16:52.917
He rules over America.

16:53.333 --> 17:01.458
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

17:01.999 --> 17:05.583
He is the Lord of wealth.

17:06.000 --> 17:09.709
So, He has given wealth to America.

17:10.166 --> 17:17.875
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

17:18.542 --> 17:24.166
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

17:24.583 --> 17:29.166
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

17:29.625 --> 17:36.583
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

17:37.041 --> 17:43.208
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

17:43.667 --> 17:45.959
that is working in America.

17:46.375 --> 17:51.542
So they are going just the opposite way

17:51.959 --> 17:54.750
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

17:55.125 --> 17:57.083
so America is going.

17:57.458 --> 18:00.125
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

18:00.500 --> 18:05.166
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

18:05.417 --> 18:06.750
I mean, one can ask question,

18:07.041 --> 18:08.750
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

18:09.125 --> 18:11.041
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

18:11.500 --> 18:13.250
Why are you sending troops all over?

18:13.583 --> 18:15.000
Why are you looking after everyone?”

18:15.375 --> 18:17.959
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

18:18.291 --> 18:22.291
under the guidance of the Americans.

18:22.667 --> 18:24.959
They play a very important part

18:25.291 --> 18:28.917
in the formation of this United Nations

18:29.333 --> 18:34.625
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

18:35.125 --> 18:41.458
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

18:41.917 --> 18:44.333
they are missing.

18:44.709 --> 18:46.375
They are all right for communication.

18:46.667 --> 18:50.208
They are all right for establishing

18:50.542 --> 18:53.375
relationships between countries.

18:53.792 --> 18:57.959
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

18:58.250 --> 19:01.959
no idea of dharma, no morality.

19:02.917 --> 19:06.542
Democracy without morality.

19:06.999 --> 19:12.500
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

19:13.000 --> 19:17.500
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

19:18.000 --> 19:22.208
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

19:22.583 --> 19:25.625
is really torturing them.

19:26.083 --> 19:30.125
And also they are realizing, some of them,

19:30.458 --> 19:33.750
that because of immoral behavior

19:34.208 --> 19:38.792
they have come to a point where

19:39.125 --> 19:43.458
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

19:43.875 --> 19:50.208
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

19:50.667 --> 19:52.917
at a very young age.

19:53.250 --> 19:58.458
When it is coming

19:58.917 --> 20:05.792
as a starking

20:09.625 --> 20:13.000
information is a shock.

20:13.417 --> 20:17.041
But despite that, despite all this,

20:17.417 --> 20:20.542
they are still going on with it and thinking that

20:20.875 --> 20:25.792
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

20:26.333 --> 20:30.417
Now His punishments have started,

20:30.875 --> 20:34.792
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

20:35.166 --> 20:39.750
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

20:40.208 --> 20:44.709
and as a result he develops some disease.

20:45.250 --> 20:49.750
Now this disease is not curable.

20:50.583 --> 20:53.667
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

20:54.000 --> 20:56.542
of curing these diseases which are coming

20:56.917 --> 21:00.500
out of immoral living. They cannot.

21:00.959 --> 21:07.083
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

21:07.333 --> 21:11.458
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

21:11.750 --> 21:14.208
which are coming out of immorality.

21:14.542 --> 21:17.542
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

21:17.959 --> 21:21.834
that immorality is wrong.

21:22.417 --> 21:28.166
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

21:28.583 --> 21:31.917
leads to these things.

21:32.458 --> 21:36.917
And this immorality is completely neglected

21:37.375 --> 21:41.125
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

21:41.625 --> 21:47.458
always He says, just to establish morality.

21:48.750 --> 21:51.792
Artificial morality, that is there,

21:52.208 --> 21:55.709
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

21:56.166 --> 22:01.375
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

22:01.834 --> 22:04.166
They follow one code of conduct

22:04.583 --> 22:11.667
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

22:12.041 --> 22:15.750
But America is an open thing.

22:16.166 --> 22:19.500
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

22:19.959 --> 22:22.083
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

22:22.583 --> 22:24.166
So they are not hiding it.

22:24.542 --> 22:28.500
And this has led this country, such a vast,

22:28.875 --> 22:31.458
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

22:31.834 --> 22:35.375
into such a ditch that I do not know

22:35.792 --> 22:38.500
how it is going to recover unless and until

22:38.875 --> 22:41.375
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

22:41.792 --> 22:48.041
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

22:48.709 --> 22:51.750
A dharmic person is the one who is always

22:52.083 --> 22:54.500
introspective by nature.

22:54.959 --> 23:01.792
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

23:02.250 --> 23:07.333
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

23:07.875 --> 23:10.875
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

23:11.208 --> 23:12.834
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

23:13.333 --> 23:19.333
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

23:19.834 --> 23:25.083
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

23:25.542 --> 23:28.458
They never try to introspect themselves.

23:28.959 --> 23:32.999
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

23:33.458 --> 23:37.125
Those people who go on like this

23:37.542 --> 23:45.208
will definitely fall into a mess of things

23:45.583 --> 23:53.125
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

23:54.875 --> 24:02.125
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

24:02.500 --> 24:05.999
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

24:06.375 --> 24:08.500
They may be guided in one part.

24:08.917 --> 24:11.542
For example, you see, they might say that

24:11.999 --> 24:16.125
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

24:16.542 --> 24:22.999
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

24:23.417 --> 24:27.999
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

24:28.375 --> 24:29.999
or whatever it is.”

24:30.375 --> 24:33.333
But all these things are extremely superficial

24:33.750 --> 24:37.250
for human beings and they are outside.

24:37.750 --> 24:42.875
The inside is all managed by the conscience

24:43.250 --> 24:48.999
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

24:49.417 --> 24:52.041
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

24:52.500 --> 24:53.917
This conscience is there.

24:54.333 --> 24:59.667
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

25:00.083 --> 25:03.875
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

25:04.417 --> 25:08.125
And this conscience has to answer.

25:08.625 --> 25:12.250
That conscience that is within us is,

25:12.667 --> 25:18.291
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

25:18.875 --> 25:22.333
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

25:22.875 --> 25:26.959
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

25:27.375 --> 25:31.041
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

25:32.375 --> 25:36.583
By listening to your conscience

25:37.208 --> 25:45.291
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

25:45.875 --> 25:48.208
But the people who have no conscience,

25:48.625 --> 25:52.834
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

25:53.208 --> 25:55.000
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

25:55.417 --> 25:57.792
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

25:58.208 --> 26:02.125
So the conscience has to be referred to,

26:02.667 --> 26:05.917
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

26:06.417 --> 26:09.542
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

26:09.959 --> 26:11.500
or to snatch somebody’s money

26:11.959 --> 26:15.834
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

26:16.291 --> 26:20.667
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

26:21.125 --> 26:24.500
At a time when people invaded so many countries

26:24.917 --> 26:28.375
and tried to overpower them,

26:28.875 --> 26:31.333
it was America which was the only country,

26:31.709 --> 26:35.041
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

26:35.500 --> 26:37.999
to become empires.

26:38.458 --> 26:40.709
Very surprising, what kept them there.

26:41.125 --> 26:44.041
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

26:44.417 --> 26:49.542
all over the world, and that era when people

26:49.917 --> 26:51.834
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

26:52.125 --> 26:56.291
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

26:57.000 --> 26:59.875
America had stopped at that time.

27:00.291 --> 27:02.959
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

27:03.375 --> 27:06.583
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

27:06.917 --> 27:09.792
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

27:10.208 --> 27:12.333
But after having done that,

27:12.834 --> 27:16.166
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

27:16.667 --> 27:19.542
they did not do it.

27:20.041 --> 27:23.750
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.125
We should ask a question:

27:25.500 --> 27:28.291
when others were expanding their empires,

27:28.625 --> 27:32.625
why did not America do it?

27:33.208 --> 27:35.500
The reason is very simple.

27:35.834 --> 27:39.375
At that time some great people with great conscience

27:39.792 --> 27:41.792
were born in that country

27:42.208 --> 27:45.667
and they guided that country.

27:46.083 --> 27:50.291
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

27:50.792 --> 27:56.166
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

27:56.542 --> 27:58.291
there will be a big list of those people.

27:58.625 --> 28:01.709
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

28:02.041 --> 28:04.250
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

28:04.709 --> 28:07.625
full of conscience, full of conscience.

28:08.083 --> 28:13.291
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

28:13.709 --> 28:16.709
to the ambition of gathering other countries

28:17.125 --> 28:19.375
and making them their slaves and ...

28:19.792 --> 28:22.250
This they didn’t do.

28:22.750 --> 28:28.542
So in the first place when the,

28:28.959 --> 28:31.458
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

28:31.875 --> 28:37.000
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

28:37.458 --> 28:40.083
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

28:40.458 --> 28:43.166
all of them, when they conquered that country,

28:43.583 --> 28:46.291
once they settled down there,

28:46.834 --> 28:52.166
as if that era was over for them once for all,

28:52.667 --> 28:55.959
and then they started talking about freedom,

28:56.417 --> 29:00.667
of democracy, of higher values.

29:01.208 --> 29:08.291
But the karmas of their past,

29:08.917 --> 29:14.083
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

29:14.583 --> 29:17.125
so many Red Indians,

29:17.625 --> 29:21.667
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

29:22.166 --> 29:27.542
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

29:29.083 --> 29:32.333
Despite that time when they did not try

29:32.834 --> 29:36.166
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

29:36.583 --> 29:42.375
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

29:42.875 --> 29:46.041
And they always stood for something that is justice …

29:46.542 --> 29:48.250
tried to, I mean, at least.

29:48.625 --> 29:52.291
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

29:52.667 --> 29:55.667
on the face of it, they tried to show

29:55.999 --> 29:58.999
that they are for uniting the whole world.

29:59.375 --> 30:04.083
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

30:04.458 --> 30:09.834
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

30:10.291 --> 30:16.625
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

30:16.999 --> 30:19.542
started working in them.

30:19.834 --> 30:24.959
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

30:25.291 --> 30:29.166
are working against them.

30:30.166 --> 30:35.917
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

30:36.375 --> 30:39.041
So many diseases, so many things,

30:39.542 --> 30:44.834
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

30:45.333 --> 30:49.375
very, very recently in America,

30:51.125 --> 30:55.583
because the exposure is coming up.

30:56.041 --> 30:58.999
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

30:59.333 --> 31:04.583
who went there and captured

31:05.625 --> 31:08.417
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

31:08.625 --> 31:11.041
We have lost so many of them in America.

31:11.417 --> 31:16.542
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

31:17.041 --> 31:19.959
curses of the people whom they had killed,

31:20.375 --> 31:25.250
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

31:25.667 --> 31:28.291
Why should they have taken to wrong things

31:28.667 --> 31:32.125
as far as their personal life is concerned?

31:32.583 --> 31:34.750
Freedom was given to them

31:35.208 --> 31:39.250
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

31:39.709 --> 31:43.000
or to make a mess out of their lives.

31:43.583 --> 31:47.333
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

31:47.834 --> 31:50.125
Then the whole idea became collective.

31:50.625 --> 31:53.208
When it became collective they found out that people

31:53.667 --> 31:56.375
like all those things that are destructive.

31:56.917 --> 31:58.917
So, we have Hollywood there,

31:59.375 --> 32:03.000
we have all such organizations and musicians

32:03.542 --> 32:10.500
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

32:11.333 --> 32:18.625
which have formed groups and militant organizations

32:19.000 --> 32:26.250
which openly say that “We are that.”

32:26.625 --> 32:33.458
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

32:33.917 --> 32:38.125
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

32:38.709 --> 32:42.917
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

32:43.417 --> 32:48.625
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

32:49.125 --> 32:51.583
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

32:51.917 --> 32:53.917
that this is a black magic organization,

32:54.291 --> 32:55.875
this is a witchcraft organization,

32:56.291 --> 32:59.458
openly they are registered there.

32:59.959 --> 33:03.166
So to such an extent they have gone;

33:03.625 --> 33:07.083
and accepted collectively.

33:07.542 --> 33:12.208
The reason is the punishment.

33:12.959 --> 33:18.333
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

33:18.834 --> 33:22.125
for Sahaja Yoga.

33:22.583 --> 33:25.208
One must have real sympathy for them.

33:25.709 --> 33:30.208
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

33:30.792 --> 33:35.583
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

33:36.000 --> 33:41.000
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

33:41.792 --> 33:45.000
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

33:45.458 --> 33:49.959
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

33:50.333 --> 33:56.083
into the hands of something else.

33:56.542 --> 34:01.500
So to establish Dharma in America,

34:02.291 --> 34:04.000
what can we do?

34:04.458 --> 34:07.166
I’ve been to America at least ten times

34:07.583 --> 34:10.917
more than I’ve been to Russia

34:11.458 --> 34:18.583
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

34:18.875 --> 34:21.125
"You have lost your Dharma."

34:21.500 --> 34:22.999
But this will never appeal to them

34:23.333 --> 34:24.667
because they are very egoistical.

34:25.041 --> 34:28.083
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

34:28.542 --> 34:30.959
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

34:31.291 --> 34:34.792
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

34:35.208 --> 34:38.500
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

34:38.959 --> 34:41.500
So it’s a difficult task in that country

34:41.917 --> 34:46.083
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

34:46.542 --> 34:49.250
that this punishment you can only overcome

34:49.667 --> 34:51.917
if you become Sahaja yogis.

34:52.291 --> 34:55.959
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

34:56.417 --> 35:01.834
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

35:02.250 --> 35:04.834
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

35:05.208 --> 35:07.041
than any other country.

35:07.500 --> 35:11.000
My concern for America is for the same reason.

35:11.583 --> 35:14.000
I’m not saying so much about South America

35:14.542 --> 35:16.875
but more about the North America.

35:17.291 --> 35:20.375
But even in South America, what I found is

35:20.917 --> 35:28.959
that it is a kind of a nation

35:29.583 --> 35:36.999
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

35:37.792 --> 35:40.709
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

35:41.166 --> 35:46.333
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

35:46.750 --> 35:50.291
They are following the footsteps of North America.

35:50.750 --> 35:53.625
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

35:53.999 --> 35:55.458
I mean, imagine openly on the street

35:55.875 --> 35:57.750
doing Halloween nonsense.

35:58.125 --> 35:59.667
So they are following carnival.

36:00.083 --> 36:03.041
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

36:03.417 --> 36:07.041
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

36:07.417 --> 36:08.542
from all over the places.

36:08.999 --> 36:13.208
From Australia people are coming down.

36:14.500 --> 36:19.792
All this is working against them very much.

36:20.166 --> 36:23.500
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

36:24.000 --> 36:30.625
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

36:31.125 --> 36:37.250
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

36:37.875 --> 36:41.083
Openly.

36:41.959 --> 36:46.000
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

36:46.542 --> 36:49.500
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

36:49.959 --> 36:52.375
Their politicians are corrupt.

36:52.750 --> 36:56.208
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

36:56.625 --> 36:59.542
so much of black magic. Openly that.

36:59.999 --> 37:06.000
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

37:06.500 --> 37:11.458
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

37:11.959 --> 37:15.417
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

37:15.917 --> 37:18.999
So they go to church, they do everything

37:19.417 --> 37:25.417
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

37:25.999 --> 37:29.999
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

37:30.500 --> 37:35.625
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

37:36.166 --> 37:39.667
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

37:40.291 --> 37:42.458
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

37:42.917 --> 37:45.792
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

37:46.250 --> 37:51.375
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

37:51.792 --> 37:54.834
They indulge into black magic too much.

37:55.208 --> 37:57.999
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

37:58.291 --> 38:00.834
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

38:01.250 --> 38:04.875
But so much it is developed in South America

38:05.291 --> 38:08.417
that it is impossible to understand that

38:09.000 --> 38:11.625
how they have accepted this nonsense

38:12.083 --> 38:15.417
so easily to curse themselves.

38:15.875 --> 38:18.625
Now, we have to understand that these problems

38:18.959 --> 38:24.291
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

38:25.083 --> 38:31.000
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

38:31.667 --> 38:36.792
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

38:37.458 --> 38:44.999
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

38:45.458 --> 38:48.583
which is talking about Dharma,

38:48.999 --> 38:54.333
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

38:55.208 --> 38:58.709
Now those people who are aggressive,

38:59.208 --> 39:01.000
who talk in an aggressive manner,

39:01.417 --> 39:07.291
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

39:08.000 --> 39:11.875
are the people who are right-sided.

39:12.291 --> 39:16.875
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

39:17.250 --> 39:21.417
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

39:21.999 --> 39:25.999
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

39:26.333 --> 39:27.709
This man is so rude.

39:28.083 --> 39:33.000
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

39:33.458 --> 39:37.542
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

39:38.000 --> 39:40.250
So those people who are right-sided

39:40.667 --> 39:43.208
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

39:43.625 --> 39:44.875
any wrong they have done,

39:45.250 --> 39:48.625
any murder they have done, by their talk.

39:49.125 --> 39:53.959
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

39:54.333 --> 39:58.500
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

39:58.917 --> 40:02.083
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

40:02.542 --> 40:05.542
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

40:05.917 --> 40:08.959
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

40:09.333 --> 40:13.583
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

40:14.000 --> 40:18.542
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

40:19.000 --> 40:22.917
and then we try to justify it by talking,

40:23.792 --> 40:25.667
wriggling out of it.

40:26.000 --> 40:32.542
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

40:32.999 --> 40:36.542
have come out of it by just talking,

40:37.083 --> 40:40.375
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

40:40.875 --> 40:43.834
That also is with all human beings,

40:44.250 --> 40:47.291
they have this capacity to say something

40:47.709 --> 40:51.959
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

40:52.333 --> 40:54.583
But it is never realized by them

40:55.041 --> 40:59.709
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

41:00.959 --> 41:04.458
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

41:04.999 --> 41:07.875
because Shri Krishna is finished.

41:08.417 --> 41:13.792
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

41:14.417 --> 41:19.333
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

41:19.792 --> 41:24.417
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

41:24.917 --> 41:29.458
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

41:30.041 --> 41:37.333
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

41:37.792 --> 41:42.250
a culture, a style, a behavior

41:42.709 --> 41:45.500
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

41:45.917 --> 41:51.083
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

41:51.500 --> 41:56.041
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

41:56.542 --> 41:59.583
The person who listens to you,

42:00.041 --> 42:07.625
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

42:08.083 --> 42:12.375
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

42:12.834 --> 42:18.166
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

42:18.750 --> 42:20.709
It should not be aggressive, at all,

42:21.125 --> 42:24.083
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

42:24.583 --> 42:28.458
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

42:28.959 --> 42:33.542
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

42:33.917 --> 42:36.500
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

42:36.917 --> 42:40.667
So in no way one should hurt.

42:41.208 --> 42:45.875
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

42:46.166 --> 42:49.834
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

42:50.166 --> 42:56.417
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

42:56.792 --> 43:01.417
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

43:01.834 --> 43:05.625
you can express your madhurya.

43:06.125 --> 43:11.250
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

43:11.667 --> 43:13.458
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

43:13.875 --> 43:15.542
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

43:15.999 --> 43:17.750
So they use their hands in such a way

43:18.125 --> 43:21.834
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

43:22.250 --> 43:24.500
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

43:24.917 --> 43:26.500
the way they use their hands.

43:26.917 --> 43:29.834
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

43:30.250 --> 43:33.250
that it should create madhurya.

43:33.709 --> 43:38.834
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

43:39.208 --> 43:42.625
where people, they have to express their love

43:43.000 --> 43:47.750
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

43:48.166 --> 43:50.709
The whole expression is so sweet,

43:51.125 --> 43:57.375
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

43:57.792 --> 43:59.834
So they don’t know how to express it.

44:00.208 --> 44:04.542
So they just put their hands like this.

44:04.999 --> 44:07.166
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

44:07.709 --> 44:11.792
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

44:12.083 --> 44:17.583
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

44:17.999 --> 44:25.625
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

44:25.959 --> 44:28.667
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

44:29.083 --> 44:33.625
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

44:34.083 --> 44:39.333
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

44:39.750 --> 44:44.917
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

44:45.375 --> 44:48.542
So in their behavior, in their talking,

44:49.000 --> 44:52.667
how they express themselves.

44:53.166 --> 44:54.875
You can use the same eyes

44:55.291 --> 44:57.333
for showing your temper and getting angry.

44:57.792 --> 45:00.583
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

45:00.999 --> 45:04.458
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

45:04.959 --> 45:11.166
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

45:11.667 --> 45:15.999
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

45:16.500 --> 45:22.625
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

45:23.083 --> 45:29.917
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

45:30.333 --> 45:33.500
Like when I went to, went to England first,

45:33.999 --> 45:36.834
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

45:37.208 --> 45:39.291
But when I went there newly they said,

45:39.625 --> 45:41.709
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

45:42.000 --> 45:44.709
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

45:45.083 --> 45:48.417
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

45:48.792 --> 45:52.250
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

45:52.667 --> 45:55.792
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

45:56.125 --> 46:00.583
is not something, proper expression.”

46:01.000 --> 46:03.000
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

46:03.375 --> 46:06.458
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

46:06.875 --> 46:08.792
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

46:09.125 --> 46:10.458
automatically he shows his tongue.

46:10.834 --> 46:16.917
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

46:17.291 --> 46:20.458
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

46:20.792 --> 46:24.000
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

46:24.333 --> 46:27.458
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

46:27.917 --> 46:34.083
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

46:34.542 --> 46:39.208
or to make an expression out of your nose.

46:39.583 --> 46:41.000
Also people do it like this, you see,

46:41.375 --> 46:44.291
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

46:44.792 --> 46:47.333
All these things, expressions, are coming

46:47.834 --> 46:54.458
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

46:54.999 --> 46:58.250
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

46:58.750 --> 47:04.709
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

47:05.166 --> 47:08.333
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

47:08.750 --> 47:13.166
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

47:13.583 --> 47:17.667
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

47:18.000 --> 47:21.125
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

47:21.583 --> 47:25.542
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

47:25.959 --> 47:29.458
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

47:29.959 --> 47:34.375
Then it soothes down and also you develop

47:34.834 --> 47:37.542
the soothing quality of the greenery.

47:37.999 --> 47:40.625
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

47:41.041 --> 47:42.291
how it soothes your eyes.”

47:42.792 --> 47:46.291
In the same way you should try to soothe

47:47.083 --> 47:49.542
the other person when you talk to that person.

47:49.917 --> 47:51.500
The person must melt.

47:51.875 --> 47:55.792
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

47:56.208 --> 47:57.375
that person will never melt.

47:57.709 --> 48:01.834
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

48:02.333 --> 48:06.166
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

48:06.625 --> 48:11.417
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

48:11.834 --> 48:15.875
how He beautifully managed to say things

48:16.250 --> 48:22.500
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

48:23.291 --> 48:26.834
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

48:27.166 --> 48:33.333
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

48:33.667 --> 48:35.667
But there are two types of diplomacies:

48:36.041 --> 48:38.542
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

48:38.999 --> 48:43.667
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

48:44.041 --> 48:48.041
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

48:48.542 --> 48:51.750
to know what is diplomacy.

48:52.166 --> 48:55.333
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

48:55.750 --> 48:59.000
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

48:59.458 --> 49:02.458
in such a genuine manner.

49:02.917 --> 49:05.667
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

49:06.041 --> 49:08.500
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

49:08.875 --> 49:11.917
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

49:12.333 --> 49:15.041
not possible if you are angry.

49:15.542 --> 49:19.500
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

49:19.959 --> 49:21.291
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

49:21.625 --> 49:24.709
I went to meet him and he was very angry

49:25.125 --> 49:26.834
because he could not stop the rain.

49:27.333 --> 49:28.625
He was supposed to stop the rain.

49:28.999 --> 49:30.583
And I was all drenched.

49:30.959 --> 49:32.667
And he was so angry and he said that

49:32.999 --> 49:35.250
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

49:35.583 --> 49:38.166
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

49:38.375 --> 49:40.458
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

49:40.959 --> 49:44.166
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

49:44.500 --> 49:45.333
You are all drenched.”

49:45.667 --> 49:48.208
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

49:48.542 --> 49:49.834
and you bought a sari for Me.

49:50.125 --> 49:51.999
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

49:52.375 --> 49:54.458
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

49:54.959 --> 49:59.417
The whole thing finished off.

50:00.000 --> 50:03.208
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

50:03.750 --> 50:06.542
This is how we have to melt people.

50:07.000 --> 50:12.208
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

50:12.583 --> 50:16.375
with his intellect or by temper or anything

50:16.792 --> 50:22.709
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

50:23.208 --> 50:25.542
by your good words, by your sweet words,

50:25.959 --> 50:27.792
by your forgiving nature.

50:28.208 --> 50:32.875
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

50:33.250 --> 50:35.999
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

50:36.458 --> 50:38.000
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

50:38.500 --> 50:40.500
It’s the reaction of the another person

50:40.917 --> 50:43.000
which is important to be seen.

50:43.375 --> 50:46.917
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

50:47.291 --> 50:52.083
is to talk to others and melt them away.

50:52.417 --> 50:56.542
I hope in America people develop this quality

50:57.000 --> 51:00.875
and try to improve relations with each other.

51:01.208 --> 51:04.208
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

51:04.667 --> 51:06.250
They get very friendly with you.

51:06.625 --> 51:08.250
You give them any number of presents,

51:08.625 --> 51:11.291
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

51:11.709 --> 51:13.667
You call them for dinner, anything,

51:14.083 --> 51:16.834
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

51:17.250 --> 51:19.166
but they will never call you for dinner.

51:19.625 --> 51:22.041
You see, they are very friendly as long

51:22.417 --> 51:23.959
as you are doing anything for them.

51:24.375 --> 51:27.917
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

51:28.333 --> 51:31.917
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

51:32.208 --> 51:35.542
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

51:36.041 --> 51:38.959
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

51:39.375 --> 51:42.750
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

51:43.125 --> 51:47.000
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

51:47.417 --> 51:52.834
that he can understand what is goodness.

51:53.500 --> 51:56.291
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

51:56.792 --> 52:01.375
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

52:01.792 --> 52:04.667
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

52:05.125 --> 52:08.125
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

52:08.625 --> 52:12.417
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

52:12.834 --> 52:15.625
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

52:16.083 --> 52:18.542
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

52:18.959 --> 52:20.041
on the left side.

52:20.375 --> 52:22.667
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

52:22.999 --> 52:25.375
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

52:25.834 --> 52:27.333
Their whole behavior is that

52:27.792 --> 52:29.875
as if they have done something wrong

52:30.291 --> 52:33.166
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

52:33.625 --> 52:38.208
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

52:38.667 --> 52:41.250
We are all Sahaja yogis.

52:41.667 --> 52:44.333
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

52:44.709 --> 52:46.458
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

52:46.875 --> 52:48.709
So this guilt has to go away.

52:49.083 --> 52:54.208
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

52:54.667 --> 52:57.750
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

52:58.166 --> 53:00.667
But we cannot see.

53:01.041 --> 53:04.375
We cannot witness what’s wrong

53:04.834 --> 53:06.792
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

53:07.083 --> 53:10.999
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

53:11.417 --> 53:13.500
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

53:13.834 --> 53:15.834
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

53:16.250 --> 53:17.917
But we do not want to face it.

53:18.291 --> 53:22.417
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

53:22.792 --> 53:26.333
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

53:26.750 --> 53:28.709
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

53:29.041 --> 53:30.917
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

53:31.250 --> 53:35.083
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

53:35.458 --> 53:37.875
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

53:38.166 --> 53:40.333
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

53:40.750 --> 53:44.166
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

53:44.583 --> 53:48.125
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

53:48.625 --> 53:50.583
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

53:50.875 --> 53:52.500
what are the problems are of the guilt,

53:52.875 --> 53:57.208
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

53:57.750 --> 54:00.583
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

54:01.000 --> 54:06.375
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

54:06.792 --> 54:09.208
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

54:09.667 --> 54:11.709
We know we are no good,” this, that.

54:12.166 --> 54:15.333
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

54:18.625 --> 54:20.917
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

54:21.291 --> 54:23.458
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

54:23.875 --> 54:26.375
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

54:26.834 --> 54:28.583
And it was really very sweet of him.

54:29.041 --> 54:32.625
So then one journalist came and we told him.

54:32.959 --> 54:35.083
And now I think they are doing something about it.

54:35.417 --> 54:38.000
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

54:38.500 --> 54:43.000
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

54:43.333 --> 54:46.583
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

54:46.999 --> 54:49.542
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

54:49.999 --> 54:51.834
They said, “That time is over now.

54:52.166 --> 54:55.417
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

54:55.792 --> 54:59.792
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

55:00.125 --> 55:03.834
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

55:04.166 --> 55:06.417
Never talked of their past, of their governments

55:06.792 --> 55:11.333
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

55:11.792 --> 55:14.875
They were not concerned. They were above it.

55:15.291 --> 55:17.583
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

55:17.917 --> 55:19.417
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

55:19.834 --> 55:22.458
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

55:22.875 --> 55:25.792
about their problems or anything.

55:26.208 --> 55:28.000
They think, “Our problems are solved.

55:28.417 --> 55:30.166
We are now realized souls.

55:30.583 --> 55:33.375
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

55:33.792 --> 55:37.000
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

55:37.500 --> 55:39.458
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

55:39.834 --> 55:42.250
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

55:42.667 --> 55:46.000
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

55:46.375 --> 55:48.458
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

55:48.875 --> 55:51.583
Just throw it or I burn it off.

55:52.041 --> 55:54.542
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

55:55.000 --> 55:58.709
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

55:59.000 --> 56:02.250
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

56:02.625 --> 56:06.208
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

56:06.625 --> 56:09.999
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

56:10.375 --> 56:12.333
But still he remembers his past more,

56:12.750 --> 56:14.291
so anybody who passes by he says,

56:14.625 --> 56:18.625
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

56:19.000 --> 56:20.999
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

56:21.375 --> 56:23.458
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

56:23.917 --> 56:28.750
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

56:29.166 --> 56:30.834
and it can act through anyone.

56:31.166 --> 56:34.166
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

56:34.542 --> 56:35.875
act through anyone.

56:36.166 --> 56:39.458
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

56:39.834 --> 56:42.709
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

56:43.166 --> 56:46.792
you become vulnerable to black magic.

56:47.250 --> 56:49.875
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

56:50.291 --> 56:53.208
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

56:53.750 --> 56:57.291
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

56:57.709 --> 57:00.208
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

57:00.625 --> 57:02.291
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

57:02.709 --> 57:05.583
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

57:05.917 --> 57:07.834
or something like that. They put ideas.

57:08.208 --> 57:10.500
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

57:10.792 --> 57:13.750
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

57:14.041 --> 57:15.000
and then the guilt starts.

57:15.375 --> 57:17.166
Instead of doing something for that person

57:17.625 --> 57:20.458
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

57:20.917 --> 57:23.999
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

57:24.333 --> 57:30.250
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

57:30.667 --> 57:33.417
or being affected by black magic.

57:33.875 --> 57:37.583
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

57:37.999 --> 57:43.000
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

57:43.542 --> 57:47.083
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

57:47.500 --> 57:49.583
what He’s said always, I always feel,

57:50.000 --> 57:57.000
and that His main work is through our brain.

57:57.500 --> 58:01.542
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

58:02.041 --> 58:04.291
And as Shiva works through our heart,

58:04.667 --> 58:06.500
He works through our brain.

58:06.999 --> 58:12.583
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

58:12.999 --> 58:16.583
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

58:17.083 --> 58:20.709
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

58:21.083 --> 58:22.959
But the greatest thing that happens,

58:23.291 --> 58:25.166
that integration takes place in your brain.

58:25.583 --> 58:27.458
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

58:27.917 --> 58:29.792
and your brain wants another thing.

58:30.208 --> 58:31.625
The integration takes place.

58:31.959 --> 58:33.542
And when that integration takes place

58:33.959 --> 58:37.208
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

58:37.667 --> 58:41.999
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

58:42.333 --> 58:44.291
you just become dharmic.

58:44.667 --> 58:46.625
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

58:47.000 --> 58:50.208
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

58:50.667 --> 58:54.834
which normally is used for rationality,

58:55.291 --> 58:57.166
for justifying all that is wrong,

58:57.625 --> 59:01.917
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

59:02.291 --> 59:05.792
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

59:06.208 --> 59:11.083
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

59:11.542 --> 59:20.625
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

59:21.458 --> 59:30.834
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

59:31.291 --> 59:37.875
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

59:38.375 --> 59:44.375
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

59:44.959 --> 59:49.667
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

59:50.166 --> 59:55.667
Virata is expressed.

59:56.083 --> 59:58.250
Then you are amazed at yourself.

59:58.625 --> 01:00:01.000
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:04.000
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:06.083
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:09.375
suddenly you become a prophet.

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:12.959
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:18.500
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:23.083
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:26.125
So this is what one has to realize,

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.999
that after realization a person gets ideas

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.959
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.959
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:40.709
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:45.959
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:53.250
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:58.417
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:02.792
how your brain has changed its ways.

01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:06.875
The upside brain has become normal.

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:13.999
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:20.458
every day and see for yourself how the expression

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:26.083
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:29.542
and is acting in your life.

01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:33.750
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:38.208
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.917
and others will never doubt you.

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:43.500
May God bless you.
