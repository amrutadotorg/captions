00:06:15.625 --> 00:06:23.458
Today we have gathered here to do Shri Krishna Puja.

00:06:26.999 --> 00:06:35.208
We have to understand clearly that Shri Krishna

00:06:35.542 --> 00:06:40.667
is a very, very important deity within us

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.583
because He is the Vishnu,

00:06:46.125 --> 00:06:50.792
who resides in the Void,

00:06:52.959 --> 00:06:55.542
in the Nabhi.

00:06:56.083 --> 00:07:03.333
He is the one who generates Dharma within us.

00:07:03.792 --> 00:07:07.583
When you got your realization I didn’t tell you,

00:07:07.959 --> 00:07:10.208
“Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:15.625
I never told you that “This is not good. That is not good.”

00:07:16.083 --> 00:07:18.125
You just did it

00:07:18.583 --> 00:07:24.834
because Shri Vishnu was awakened within you.

00:07:25.709 --> 00:07:28.000
He is in the Void

00:07:28.458 --> 00:07:32.542
and if He is awakened

00:07:33.417 --> 00:07:40.667
He brings you to the light,

00:07:41.417 --> 00:07:44.583
removes your ignorance, removes your darkness,

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.083
and you start seeing that

00:07:50.375 --> 00:07:54.458
whatever you were doing was destructive for you,

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:59.667
and that’s how the dharma is established.

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.750
Of course, the Dharma was established also

00:08:04.208 --> 00:08:10.375
by all the ten Gurus who came on this earth,

00:08:10.709 --> 00:08:15.041
the prophets, who taught us about dharma.

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:29.208
So this combination of Shri Vishnu

00:08:29.583 --> 00:08:33.000
and the ten Gurus

00:08:33.417 --> 00:08:38.834
is to establish Dharma within us.

00:08:39.208 --> 00:08:42.166
Now this Dharma is taught by prophets,

00:08:42.542 --> 00:08:44.250
as you have seen everywhere.

00:08:44.583 --> 00:08:48.041
They have said, “Don’t do this. Don’t do that.”

00:08:48.458 --> 00:08:50.834
They have talked of Ten Commandments.

00:08:51.208 --> 00:08:57.208
Every prophet has talked about Dharma, what is to be done,

00:08:57.959 --> 00:09:02.041
up to a point when Christ also had to talk about it

00:09:02.500 --> 00:09:06.583
and He says, “Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:15.291
But Shri Krishna is the one

00:09:15.709 --> 00:09:21.375
who says that “I come on this earth

00:09:21.834 --> 00:09:31.834
when there is a glani, means demise, of Dharma.”

00:09:33.208 --> 00:09:35.458
When the Dharma becomes weak

00:09:35.875 --> 00:09:38.208
then He comes on this Earth,

00:09:38.709 --> 00:09:41.417
and then He destroys the people

00:09:41.834 --> 00:09:47.041
who are responsible

00:09:47.792 --> 00:09:56.500
for bringing Dharma to this level of doom.

00:09:57.583 --> 00:10:00.500
The second thing He says, that

00:10:00.959 --> 00:10:06.125
“I protect the saints. I protect the saints

00:10:07.500 --> 00:10:15.333
and I kill all those who are devils or who are satanic,

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.333
who are destructive.”

00:10:17.709 --> 00:10:19.375
These are His promises

00:10:19.792 --> 00:10:24.250
which He gave long time back as Shri Krishna.

00:10:24.667 --> 00:10:29.458
As Vishnu we know Him only as the one

00:10:29.875 --> 00:10:33.792
who is the giver of Dharma, mainly.

00:10:34.291 --> 00:10:38.000
But all His potent qualities really were expressed

00:10:38.417 --> 00:10:40.500
when He came as Shri Krishna.

00:10:40.959 --> 00:10:44.083
At the time of Shri Rama also these qualities

00:10:44.542 --> 00:10:47.458
could not be expressed in that way.

00:10:49.542 --> 00:10:52.750
So Shri Krishna’s first half of His life

00:10:53.125 --> 00:10:55.500
He spent in Gokul and Vrindavan

00:10:55.959 --> 00:11:03.625
where He showed His beautiful expression of His character,

00:11:04.125 --> 00:11:08.083
as He made it,

00:11:08.542 --> 00:11:11.750
what He calls as Leela, Leeladhara,

00:11:12.083 --> 00:11:16.959
the one who said that you become a witness;

00:11:18.583 --> 00:11:21.875
you witness the whole world like a drama,

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:23.542
Sakshi Swarupa.

00:11:23.917 --> 00:11:30.583
And then once you see the whole world as just

00:11:31.083 --> 00:11:38.250
a child watches, in a child-like mirth and joy, you enjoy life.

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:40.000
That has happened to you people

00:11:40.375 --> 00:11:45.458
that you have become like citizens of Vrindavan and Gokul,

00:11:45.834 --> 00:11:47.542
the way you are enjoying yourself,

00:11:47.917 --> 00:11:53.250
enjoying each other’s company, enjoying the bliss of God.

00:11:53.667 --> 00:11:56.542
Then He showed also by killing Kaliya,

00:11:56.917 --> 00:11:59.208
by killing Putana and other people,

00:11:59.667 --> 00:12:06.500
that if anybody tries to trouble such joyous children of God,

00:12:06.875 --> 00:12:12.750
He is the one who will definitely protect

00:12:13.083 --> 00:12:17.375
and kill all such evil forces which are troublesome.

00:12:17.917 --> 00:12:22.709
But later on He becomes the king,

00:12:23.125 --> 00:12:26.250
and when He becomes the king

00:12:26.625 --> 00:12:30.999
He uses His powers in a different way.

00:12:31.333 --> 00:12:35.417
First of all, if you see His own uncle, His own relation,

00:12:35.750 --> 00:12:39.250
His own uncle, mother’s brother, was Kansa,

00:12:39.709 --> 00:12:41.792
and was such a bad man.

00:12:42.208 --> 00:12:46.458
So Shri Krishna didn’t spare him, He killed him.

00:12:46.875 --> 00:12:49.083
He killed so many people.

00:12:49.542 --> 00:12:53.208
Before becoming the king, He killed so many people.

00:12:53.667 --> 00:13:00.959
Now what does that mean, that His own uncle He killed?

00:13:01.417 --> 00:13:09.000
One quality that He has, which Christ had, we can say,

00:13:09.458 --> 00:13:14.999
or so many saints had, is forgiveness.

00:13:15.375 --> 00:13:19.208
He did not believe in forgiveness.

00:13:19.709 --> 00:13:24.792
He’s the only one who said that, “I have to punish.”

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:28.500
We have to have somebody who should punish also.

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:30.625
If you are like Shiva,

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.834
then Shiva used to even love rakshasas

00:13:34.250 --> 00:13:38.875
and in His innocence He used to give them also blessings.

00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:45.875
But Shri Krishna did not believe in forgiveness at all

00:13:46.709 --> 00:13:50.792
because it was important that there should be

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:53.333
somebody with a very stern mind,

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:57.583
with such a stern understanding that a devil is a devil,

00:13:57.917 --> 00:14:01.417
and devil must be killed.

00:14:04.667 --> 00:14:07.375
He has done in His lifetime,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.750
if you see, killing of so many people.

00:14:11.083 --> 00:14:13.583
That doesn’t mean that we have right to kill anybody.

00:14:13.917 --> 00:14:16.792
He was Shri Krishna; we are not.

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:21.291
We have to forgive because we are human beings.

00:14:21.709 --> 00:14:25.333
Once we forgive we transfer all our anger,

00:14:25.750 --> 00:14:34.041
all our attitude of taking revenge, to Shri Krishna.

00:14:36.041 --> 00:14:37.667
He takes over.

00:14:37.999 --> 00:14:40.959
Once you say that “I forgive,” then He takes over,

00:14:41.250 --> 00:14:44.250
because He does not forgive.

00:14:44.834 --> 00:14:49.500
He will immediately take over from you

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.959
and if it is justifiable, if it is necessary

00:14:54.250 --> 00:15:00.000
He will punish the people who are torturing saints,

00:15:00.375 --> 00:15:03.291
who are destroying the dharma.

00:15:05.125 --> 00:15:06.917
Now it is very surprising

00:15:07.208 --> 00:15:10.959
that whatever is preached by the person,

00:15:11.333 --> 00:15:15.709
that area becomes just the opposite of it.

00:15:16.125 --> 00:15:18.667
Is very surprising.

00:15:19.125 --> 00:15:24.000
Like we said that Christ said,

00:15:24.291 --> 00:15:26.458
“Thou shall not have adulterous eyes.”

00:15:26.834 --> 00:15:30.709
Christians are the worst as far as their eyes are concerned.

00:15:31.333 --> 00:15:37.750
In the same way, in the Hindu religion it is said that

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:42.000
everybody has the spirit.

00:15:42.417 --> 00:15:47.250
Still the Hindus believe in the different castes and communities

00:15:47.750 --> 00:15:51.250
and fight with each other.

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:57.875
Everything that was preached, just the opposite of it is followed.

00:15:58.291 --> 00:16:00.999
If you read even Koran, in the Koran,

00:16:01.375 --> 00:16:03.959
Mohammed Sahib has all the time

00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:06.917
said about rahmat, means compassion.

00:16:07.250 --> 00:16:09.000
But you don’t find it anywhere.

00:16:09.458 --> 00:16:11.041
He has not said about shariat,

00:16:11.417 --> 00:16:12.792
He has not said of many things

00:16:13.125 --> 00:16:17.291
which are being practiced by Muslims, just on their own.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:20.083
He never said that women should cover their face

00:16:20.458 --> 00:16:22.667
or cover their heads,

00:16:23.041 --> 00:16:26.542
but it is practiced and not practiced but vengeance.

00:16:26.959 --> 00:16:32.458
So what it shows to us is this, that whatever is preached,

00:16:32.834 --> 00:16:37.166
just the opposite of that people try to do.

00:16:39.709 --> 00:16:44.542
And when such things happen, the dharma goes down.

00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.625
Now as you know that Krishna, His country is America.

00:16:51.083 --> 00:16:52.917
He rules over America.

00:16:53.333 --> 00:17:01.458
So it is a rich country because Shri Krishna is Kubera.

00:17:01.999 --> 00:17:05.583
He is the Lord of wealth.

00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.709
So, He has given wealth to America.

00:17:10.166 --> 00:17:17.875
Then He is Vachana, means communication.

00:17:18.542 --> 00:17:24.166
His another quality is that He is the one who communicated.

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:29.166
It was He who danced with gopis and gopas.

00:17:29.625 --> 00:17:36.583
It was He who transferred His powers to them.

00:17:37.041 --> 00:17:43.208
So the communication part is one of His greatest qualities

00:17:43.667 --> 00:17:45.959
that is working in America.

00:17:46.375 --> 00:17:51.542
So they are going just the opposite way

00:17:51.959 --> 00:17:54.750
that if there is a war, say, with Saddam Hussein,

00:17:55.125 --> 00:17:57.083
so America is going.

00:17:57.458 --> 00:18:00.125
If there’s Korean War, America is going.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:05.166
Everywhere there is any problem, America has to go.

00:18:05.417 --> 00:18:06.750
I mean, one can ask question,

00:18:07.041 --> 00:18:08.750
“Who are you? Why, why are you bothered?

00:18:09.125 --> 00:18:11.041
Keep to your own country enjoying yourself.

00:18:11.500 --> 00:18:13.250
Why are you sending troops all over?

00:18:13.583 --> 00:18:15.000
Why are you looking after everyone?”

00:18:15.375 --> 00:18:17.959
Even the formation of UN and all that is done

00:18:18.291 --> 00:18:22.291
under the guidance of the Americans.

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:24.959
They play a very important part

00:18:25.291 --> 00:18:28.917
in the formation of this United Nations

00:18:29.333 --> 00:18:34.625
and one world and peace and all sorts of things.

00:18:35.125 --> 00:18:41.458
But actually, if you see, the main thing that Krishna had taught,

00:18:41.917 --> 00:18:44.333
they are missing.

00:18:44.709 --> 00:18:46.375
They are all right for communication.

00:18:46.667 --> 00:18:50.208
They are all right for establishing

00:18:50.542 --> 00:18:53.375
relationships between countries.

00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:57.959
But the worst thing they have done is that there is no dharma,

00:18:58.250 --> 00:19:01.959
no idea of dharma, no morality.

00:19:02.917 --> 00:19:06.542
Democracy without morality.

00:19:06.999 --> 00:19:12.500
To talk of morality in America is something out of the blue.

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.500
They cannot understand anyone who talks of morality.

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.208
Now, of course, the pangs of their doings

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:25.625
is really torturing them.

00:19:26.083 --> 00:19:30.125
And also they are realizing, some of them,

00:19:30.458 --> 00:19:33.750
that because of immoral behavior

00:19:34.208 --> 00:19:38.792
they have come to a point where

00:19:39.125 --> 00:19:43.458
sixty-five percent people of that country who are Americans

00:19:43.875 --> 00:19:50.208
may suffer from some disease or may just die out

00:19:50.667 --> 00:19:52.917
at a very young age.

00:19:53.250 --> 00:19:58.458
When it is coming

00:19:58.917 --> 00:20:05.792
as a starking

00:20:09.625 --> 00:20:13.000
information is a shock.

00:20:13.417 --> 00:20:17.041
But despite that, despite all this,

00:20:17.417 --> 00:20:20.542
they are still going on with it and thinking that

00:20:20.875 --> 00:20:25.792
“No, no, no, it’s all right. It’s not for us. What is there to worry?”

00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:30.417
Now His punishments have started,

00:20:30.875 --> 00:20:34.792
which they don’t realize how the punishment has started.

00:20:35.166 --> 00:20:39.750
Now supposing somebody is leading an immoral life

00:20:40.208 --> 00:20:44.709
and as a result he develops some disease.

00:20:45.250 --> 00:20:49.750
Now this disease is not curable.

00:20:50.583 --> 00:20:53.667
They try everything to find out the ways and methods

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.542
of curing these diseases which are coming

00:20:56.917 --> 00:21:00.500
out of immoral living. They cannot.

00:21:00.959 --> 00:21:07.083
It’s an impossible task for all the medical sciences of America

00:21:07.333 --> 00:21:11.458
to find out how to cure these particular diseases

00:21:11.750 --> 00:21:14.208
which are coming out of immorality.

00:21:14.542 --> 00:21:17.542
But the worst part is that they cannot even say

00:21:17.959 --> 00:21:21.834
that immorality is wrong.

00:21:22.417 --> 00:21:28.166
They cannot even openly admit that immoral behavior

00:21:28.583 --> 00:21:31.917
leads to these things.

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:36.917
And this immorality is completely neglected

00:21:37.375 --> 00:21:41.125
in a country of Shri Krishna where He was born,

00:21:41.625 --> 00:21:47.458
always He says, just to establish morality.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:51.792
Artificial morality, that is there,

00:21:52.208 --> 00:21:55.709
like the Islamic talk about or the Christians talk about

00:21:56.166 --> 00:22:01.375
or Hindus talk about, is artificial, where they are hypocritical.

00:22:01.834 --> 00:22:04.166
They follow one code of conduct

00:22:04.583 --> 00:22:11.667
and another they have for themselves secretly adopted.

00:22:12.041 --> 00:22:15.750
But America is an open thing.

00:22:16.166 --> 00:22:19.500
Whatsoever they are doing they are not hiding it.

00:22:19.959 --> 00:22:22.083
They say, “We don’t believe in hypocrisy.”

00:22:22.583 --> 00:22:24.166
So they are not hiding it.

00:22:24.542 --> 00:22:28.500
And this has led this country, such a vast,

00:22:28.875 --> 00:22:31.458
beautiful, rich, prosperous country,

00:22:31.834 --> 00:22:35.375
into such a ditch that I do not know

00:22:35.792 --> 00:22:38.500
how it is going to recover unless and until

00:22:38.875 --> 00:22:41.375
it takes to Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:41.792 --> 00:22:48.041
Now another thing what dharma does to a normal person?

00:22:48.709 --> 00:22:51.750
A dharmic person is the one who is always

00:22:52.083 --> 00:22:54.500
introspective by nature.

00:22:54.959 --> 00:23:01.792
He tries to see, “Am I doing things all right? Is it correct?”

00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:07.333
He doesn’t allow his mind to justify wrong things.

00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:10.875
That is one of the signs of a real dharmic person.

00:23:11.208 --> 00:23:12.834
He may not be a Sahaja yogi.

00:23:13.333 --> 00:23:19.333
But he will ask himself, “Is it right or is it wrong?”

00:23:19.834 --> 00:23:25.083
But that capacity is completely gone in America.

00:23:25.542 --> 00:23:28.458
They never try to introspect themselves.

00:23:28.959 --> 00:23:32.999
On the contrary, they always say, “What’s wrong?”

00:23:33.458 --> 00:23:37.125
Those people who go on like this

00:23:37.542 --> 00:23:45.208
will definitely fall into a mess of things

00:23:45.583 --> 00:23:53.125
that will have no moral conductor, moral guidance.

00:23:54.875 --> 00:24:02.125
It is introspection which gives you a awakened conscience.

00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:05.999
It’s conscience which tells you, “This is wrong.”

00:24:06.375 --> 00:24:08.500
They may be guided in one part.

00:24:08.917 --> 00:24:11.542
For example, you see, they might say that

00:24:11.999 --> 00:24:16.125
“We are all right in administration,” maybe, or,

00:24:16.542 --> 00:24:22.999
“We are all right for, say, our railways, our shipping,

00:24:23.417 --> 00:24:27.999
our other things, or maybe other economic banks

00:24:28.375 --> 00:24:29.999
or whatever it is.”

00:24:30.375 --> 00:24:33.333
But all these things are extremely superficial

00:24:33.750 --> 00:24:37.250
for human beings and they are outside.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:42.875
The inside is all managed by the conscience

00:24:43.250 --> 00:24:48.999
and also through moral inspection of yourself.

00:24:49.417 --> 00:24:52.041
People say, “Mother, what is this conscience is?”

00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.917
This conscience is there.

00:24:54.333 --> 00:24:59.667
It is there all the time, but a person who has to be

00:25:00.083 --> 00:25:03.875
conscious about it. “I have a conscience”.

00:25:04.417 --> 00:25:08.125
And this conscience has to answer.

00:25:08.625 --> 00:25:12.250
That conscience that is within us is,

00:25:12.667 --> 00:25:18.291
is the light of Shri Krishna within us even before realization.

00:25:18.875 --> 00:25:22.333
As you know, the ascent takes place, of Kundalini,

00:25:22.875 --> 00:25:26.959
through the Sushumna which is guided by Mahalakshmi.

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:31.041
She is the power of Shri Krishna.

00:25:32.375 --> 00:25:36.583
By listening to your conscience

00:25:37.208 --> 00:25:45.291
you develop a proper channel of Mahalakshmi within yourself.

00:25:45.875 --> 00:25:48.208
But the people who have no conscience,

00:25:48.625 --> 00:25:52.834
in a particular line it’s not so; it is in every line, in every way.

00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:55.000
Otherwise, one chakra will be all right,

00:25:55.417 --> 00:25:57.792
another chakra will be in jeopardy.

00:25:58.208 --> 00:26:02.125
So the conscience has to be referred to,

00:26:02.667 --> 00:26:05.917
which is beyond rationality. It is not rationality.

00:26:06.417 --> 00:26:09.542
Something may look like rational to kill somebody

00:26:09.959 --> 00:26:11.500
or to snatch somebody’s money

00:26:11.959 --> 00:26:15.834
or to grab somebody’s land. May seem.

00:26:16.291 --> 00:26:20.667
But conscience will tell you that this is not right.

00:26:21.125 --> 00:26:24.500
At a time when people invaded so many countries

00:26:24.917 --> 00:26:28.375
and tried to overpower them,

00:26:28.875 --> 00:26:31.333
it was America which was the only country,

00:26:31.709 --> 00:26:35.041
you must understand, never went out of their bounds

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.999
to become empires.

00:26:38.458 --> 00:26:40.709
Very surprising, what kept them there.

00:26:41.125 --> 00:26:44.041
Because at that time when all this nonsense was going on

00:26:44.417 --> 00:26:49.542
all over the world, and that era when people

00:26:49.917 --> 00:26:51.834
didn’t mind subjecting other people,

00:26:52.125 --> 00:26:56.291
taking away their lands and becoming this thing,

00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.875
America had stopped at that time.

00:27:00.291 --> 00:27:02.959
Before doing that, they had done once for all.

00:27:03.375 --> 00:27:06.583
They had occupied the area, they became the landlords,

00:27:06.917 --> 00:27:09.792
they became this. Of course they were foreigners.

00:27:10.208 --> 00:27:12.333
But after having done that,

00:27:12.834 --> 00:27:16.166
the era when the people started expanding their empire,

00:27:16.667 --> 00:27:19.542
they did not do it.

00:27:20.041 --> 00:27:23.750
Now what is the reason? Why they didn’t do it?

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.125
We should ask a question:

00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:28.291
when others were expanding their empires,

00:27:28.625 --> 00:27:32.625
why did not America do it?

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:35.500
The reason is very simple.

00:27:35.834 --> 00:27:39.375
At that time some great people with great conscience

00:27:39.792 --> 00:27:41.792
were born in that country

00:27:42.208 --> 00:27:45.667
and they guided that country.

00:27:46.083 --> 00:27:50.291
Like, you can say, Washington was there.

00:27:50.792 --> 00:27:56.166
Of course, there were so many people, whom if I name there,

00:27:56.542 --> 00:27:58.291
there will be a big list of those people.

00:27:58.625 --> 00:28:01.709
But if you see their character, their life, the way they lived.

00:28:02.041 --> 00:28:04.250
Abraham Lincoln, if you see his life,

00:28:04.709 --> 00:28:07.625
full of conscience, full of conscience.

00:28:08.083 --> 00:28:13.291
And they didn’t allow the nation to be drifted away

00:28:13.709 --> 00:28:16.709
to the ambition of gathering other countries

00:28:17.125 --> 00:28:19.375
and making them their slaves and ...

00:28:19.792 --> 00:28:22.250
This they didn’t do.

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:28.542
So in the first place when the,

00:28:28.959 --> 00:28:31.458
when, I should say, Columbus went there, conquered them,

00:28:31.875 --> 00:28:37.000
and tried to … actually, he didn’t do much.

00:28:37.458 --> 00:28:40.083
But Spanish and then others, and then Anglo-Saxons,

00:28:40.458 --> 00:28:43.166
all of them, when they conquered that country,

00:28:43.583 --> 00:28:46.291
once they settled down there,

00:28:46.834 --> 00:28:52.166
as if that era was over for them once for all,

00:28:52.667 --> 00:28:55.959
and then they started talking about freedom,

00:28:56.417 --> 00:29:00.667
of democracy, of higher values.

00:29:01.208 --> 00:29:08.291
But the karmas of their past,

00:29:08.917 --> 00:29:14.083
the way they killed so many aboriginals,

00:29:14.583 --> 00:29:17.125
so many Red Indians,

00:29:17.625 --> 00:29:21.667
will not be forgiven by Shri Krishna

00:29:22.166 --> 00:29:27.542
unless and until now they take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:29.083 --> 00:29:32.333
Despite that time when they did not try

00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:36.166
to overpower other countries and to spread their empire

00:29:36.583 --> 00:29:42.375
and do all kinds of cruelties, like Hitler, they didn’t do that.

00:29:42.875 --> 00:29:46.041
And they always stood for something that is justice …

00:29:46.542 --> 00:29:48.250
tried to, I mean, at least.

00:29:48.625 --> 00:29:52.291
Then they became hypocritical also but on the whole,

00:29:52.667 --> 00:29:55.667
on the face of it, they tried to show

00:29:55.999 --> 00:29:58.999
that they are for uniting the whole world.

00:29:59.375 --> 00:30:04.083
They are against racialism, against fundamentalism, all these,

00:30:04.458 --> 00:30:09.834
I mean, just some sort of an idealism they propagated.

00:30:10.291 --> 00:30:16.625
But despite all that, all these ideas of self-destruction

00:30:16.999 --> 00:30:19.542
started working in them.

00:30:19.834 --> 00:30:24.959
So I would say it is nothing but their karmas

00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:29.166
are working against them.

00:30:30.166 --> 00:30:35.917
And that’s how the violence is so much rampant there.

00:30:36.375 --> 00:30:39.041
So many diseases, so many things,

00:30:39.542 --> 00:30:44.834
it is very remarkable that all these troubles have started

00:30:45.333 --> 00:30:49.375
very, very recently in America,

00:30:51.125 --> 00:30:55.583
because the exposure is coming up.

00:30:56.041 --> 00:30:58.999
To add up to that, we had lots of false gurus

00:30:59.333 --> 00:31:04.583
who went there and captured

00:31:05.625 --> 00:31:08.417
innocent, simple people who were seeking the truth.

00:31:08.625 --> 00:31:11.041
We have lost so many of them in America.

00:31:11.417 --> 00:31:16.542
Also there, I would say, in the atmosphere where these

00:31:17.041 --> 00:31:19.959
curses of the people whom they had killed,

00:31:20.375 --> 00:31:25.250
which reacted, and they took to something that was wrong.

00:31:25.667 --> 00:31:28.291
Why should they have taken to wrong things

00:31:28.667 --> 00:31:32.125
as far as their personal life is concerned?

00:31:32.583 --> 00:31:34.750
Freedom was given to them

00:31:35.208 --> 00:31:39.250
but they thought freedom is there also to ruin themselves

00:31:39.709 --> 00:31:43.000
or to make a mess out of their lives.

00:31:43.583 --> 00:31:47.333
This is a wrong idea which worked in them.

00:31:47.834 --> 00:31:50.125
Then the whole idea became collective.

00:31:50.625 --> 00:31:53.208
When it became collective they found out that people

00:31:53.667 --> 00:31:56.375
like all those things that are destructive.

00:31:56.917 --> 00:31:58.917
So, we have Hollywood there,

00:31:59.375 --> 00:32:03.000
we have all such organizations and musicians

00:32:03.542 --> 00:32:10.500
and big, big, we can say, destructive forces

00:32:11.333 --> 00:32:18.625
which have formed groups and militant organizations

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:26.250
which openly say that “We are that.”

00:32:26.625 --> 00:32:33.458
For example, only in America we have satan’s,

00:32:33.917 --> 00:32:38.125
satan’s organization, devils’ organizations.

00:32:38.709 --> 00:32:42.917
Then there’s witchcraft. Openly.

00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:48.625
Openly, they are registered organizations in America,

00:32:49.125 --> 00:32:51.583
when nowhere in the world you can have such a thing

00:32:51.917 --> 00:32:53.917
that this is a black magic organization,

00:32:54.291 --> 00:32:55.875
this is a witchcraft organization,

00:32:56.291 --> 00:32:59.458
openly they are registered there.

00:32:59.959 --> 00:33:03.166
So to such an extent they have gone;

00:33:03.625 --> 00:33:07.083
and accepted collectively.

00:33:07.542 --> 00:33:12.208
The reason is the punishment.

00:33:12.959 --> 00:33:18.333
That’s why America is the most difficult place for us,

00:33:18.834 --> 00:33:22.125
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:22.583 --> 00:33:25.208
One must have real sympathy for them.

00:33:25.709 --> 00:33:30.208
They are now passing through the phase of punishment,

00:33:30.792 --> 00:33:35.583
because their forefathers did all kinds of wrong things

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000
and they, too, never accepted Dharma as a principle of life.

00:33:41.792 --> 00:33:45.000
They thought that Dharma means killing your freedom;

00:33:45.458 --> 00:33:49.959
dharma means it takes away your personal, private life

00:33:50.333 --> 00:33:56.083
into the hands of something else.

00:33:56.542 --> 00:34:01.500
So to establish Dharma in America,

00:34:02.291 --> 00:34:04.000
what can we do?

00:34:04.458 --> 00:34:07.166
I’ve been to America at least ten times

00:34:07.583 --> 00:34:10.917
more than I’ve been to Russia

00:34:11.458 --> 00:34:18.583
and I want to really somehow or other bring to their notice that

00:34:18.875 --> 00:34:21.125
"You have lost your Dharma."

00:34:21.500 --> 00:34:22.999
But this will never appeal to them

00:34:23.333 --> 00:34:24.667
because they are very egoistical.

00:34:25.041 --> 00:34:28.083
If you tell them like that, then they’ll be very angry.

00:34:28.542 --> 00:34:30.959
On the contrary, those who tell them, like Rajneesh

00:34:31.291 --> 00:34:34.792
and all these people, “Oh, this, no dharma,” their weaknesses,

00:34:35.208 --> 00:34:38.500
their egos are pampered. Then they are very happy.

00:34:38.959 --> 00:34:41.500
So it’s a difficult task in that country

00:34:41.917 --> 00:34:46.083
to make people understand that you are under punishment,

00:34:46.542 --> 00:34:49.250
that this punishment you can only overcome

00:34:49.667 --> 00:34:51.917
if you become Sahaja yogis.

00:34:52.291 --> 00:34:55.959
With Sahaja Yoga their dharma will be awakened

00:34:56.417 --> 00:35:01.834
and all their punishments and all their curses will be over.

00:35:02.250 --> 00:35:04.834
It is America which needs Sahaja Yoga much more

00:35:05.208 --> 00:35:07.041
than any other country.

00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:11.000
My concern for America is for the same reason.

00:35:11.583 --> 00:35:14.000
I’m not saying so much about South America

00:35:14.542 --> 00:35:16.875
but more about the North America.

00:35:17.291 --> 00:35:20.375
But even in South America, what I found is

00:35:20.917 --> 00:35:28.959
that it is a kind of a nation

00:35:29.583 --> 00:35:36.999
where they have no guidance at all about Dharma, no guidance.

00:35:37.792 --> 00:35:40.709
Openly they are doing carnival, this, that.

00:35:41.166 --> 00:35:46.333
I mean, how can you do it in a country, all those things?

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:50.291
They are following the footsteps of North America.

00:35:50.750 --> 00:35:53.625
Like in North America they have that Halloween nonsense.

00:35:53.999 --> 00:35:55.458
I mean, imagine openly on the street

00:35:55.875 --> 00:35:57.750
doing Halloween nonsense.

00:35:58.125 --> 00:35:59.667
So they are following carnival.

00:36:00.083 --> 00:36:03.041
To them, “Ah, what a thing it is to go to Rio,”

00:36:03.417 --> 00:36:07.041
as if there is a very big achievement and going into that carnival

00:36:07.417 --> 00:36:08.542
from all over the places.

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:13.208
From Australia people are coming down.

00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.792
All this is working against them very much.

00:36:20.166 --> 00:36:23.500
Their situation is so bad in so many ways

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:30.625
that it is not easy to explain why they are going to that limit.

00:36:31.125 --> 00:36:37.250
Like thirteen-year-old girls are made into prostitutes in Brazil.

00:36:37.875 --> 00:36:41.083
Openly.

00:36:41.959 --> 00:36:46.000
All their trees are cut in Amazon. Openly.

00:36:46.542 --> 00:36:49.500
Whole smuggling is done, openly.

00:36:49.959 --> 00:36:52.375
Their politicians are corrupt.

00:36:52.750 --> 00:36:56.208
There, I mean, so much of black magic there,

00:36:56.625 --> 00:36:59.542
so much of black magic. Openly that.

00:36:59.999 --> 00:37:06.000
They are just following the footsteps of North America.

00:37:06.500 --> 00:37:11.458
The Dharma is like this Catholic Church is there.

00:37:11.959 --> 00:37:15.417
What is it going to teach them Dharma, this Catholic Church?

00:37:15.917 --> 00:37:18.999
So they go to church, they do everything

00:37:19.417 --> 00:37:25.417
and they come back home with same ideas that they have.

00:37:25.999 --> 00:37:29.999
There are countries and countries which are so very poor.

00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:35.625
So that shows that Kubera’s attention is not on that country.

00:37:36.166 --> 00:37:39.667
Normally, poor people are dharmic, normally.

00:37:40.291 --> 00:37:42.458
Because you see, money gives them these ideas

00:37:42.917 --> 00:37:45.792
to do all nonsensical things and ego.

00:37:46.250 --> 00:37:51.375
Normally, the poor people are dharmic but there it is different.

00:37:51.792 --> 00:37:54.834
They indulge into black magic too much.

00:37:55.208 --> 00:37:57.999
They were telling Me that it is the black magic

00:37:58.291 --> 00:38:00.834
which came from Africa and they have accepted.

00:38:01.250 --> 00:38:04.875
But so much it is developed in South America

00:38:05.291 --> 00:38:08.417
that it is impossible to understand that

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.625
how they have accepted this nonsense

00:38:12.083 --> 00:38:15.417
so easily to curse themselves.

00:38:15.875 --> 00:38:18.625
Now, we have to understand that these problems

00:38:18.959 --> 00:38:24.291
also exist within ourselves, on our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:38:25.083 --> 00:38:31.000
If we have to keep our Vishuddhi Chakra all right,

00:38:31.667 --> 00:38:36.792
we have two sides as you know, is the left and the right.

00:38:37.458 --> 00:38:44.999
So the right side is the Vishuddhi Chakra which is speaking,

00:38:45.458 --> 00:38:48.583
which is talking about Dharma,

00:38:48.999 --> 00:38:54.333
which is on the aggressive side, we can say.

00:38:55.208 --> 00:38:58.709
Now those people who are aggressive,

00:38:59.208 --> 00:39:01.000
who talk in an aggressive manner,

00:39:01.417 --> 00:39:07.291
who are, say, trying to dominate others by their talks,

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.875
are the people who are right-sided.

00:39:12.291 --> 00:39:16.875
I’ve seen people, those who really do wrong things.

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:21.417
Say, a person, a servant steals something.

00:39:21.999 --> 00:39:25.999
You call him, he’ll be so rude to you that you’ll be amazed.

00:39:26.333 --> 00:39:27.709
This man is so rude.

00:39:28.083 --> 00:39:33.000
How can he, how can have been able to steal something?

00:39:33.458 --> 00:39:37.542
He’s not afraid; he’s answering you back so nicely.

00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:40.250
So those people who are right-sided

00:39:40.667 --> 00:39:43.208
can cover up any sin that they have committed,

00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:44.875
any wrong they have done,

00:39:45.250 --> 00:39:48.625
any murder they have done, by their talk.

00:39:49.125 --> 00:39:53.959
It could be a talk which is very aggressive, blatant.

00:39:54.333 --> 00:39:58.500
People might think, “Oh, how can that be?

00:39:58.917 --> 00:40:02.083
This man is telling so loudly everything,”

00:40:02.542 --> 00:40:05.542
and you just, you are stunned and you think,

00:40:05.917 --> 00:40:08.959
“No, it’s not possible. How can a person who says this thing ?”

00:40:09.333 --> 00:40:13.583
In this way we, too, as ordinary human beings,

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:18.542
indulge into all kinds of nonsensical things

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.917
and then we try to justify it by talking,

00:40:23.792 --> 00:40:25.667
wriggling out of it.

00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.542
You know as many criminals, war criminals,

00:40:32.999 --> 00:40:36.542
have come out of it by just talking,

00:40:37.083 --> 00:40:40.375
by creating stories, by showing something like that.

00:40:40.875 --> 00:40:43.834
That also is with all human beings,

00:40:44.250 --> 00:40:47.291
they have this capacity to say something

00:40:47.709 --> 00:40:51.959
by which to hide whatever wrong you are doing.

00:40:52.333 --> 00:40:54.583
But it is never realized by them

00:40:55.041 --> 00:40:59.709
that whatever harm you have done is not going to be forgiven

00:41:00.959 --> 00:41:04.458
and will be less forgiven when you talk like this,

00:41:04.999 --> 00:41:07.875
because Shri Krishna is finished.

00:41:08.417 --> 00:41:13.792
If you start justifying, rationalizing all your wrong things,

00:41:14.417 --> 00:41:19.333
then you will be punished and you will be punished very badly

00:41:19.792 --> 00:41:24.417
in so many ways that you will not know how to get it out of it.

00:41:24.917 --> 00:41:29.458
Physically, mentally, emotionally, every way you’ll be.

00:41:30.041 --> 00:41:37.333
So our Right Vishuddhi we have to have a temperament,

00:41:37.792 --> 00:41:42.250
a culture, a style, a behavior

00:41:42.709 --> 00:41:45.500
which has got the quality of Shri Krishna,

00:41:45.917 --> 00:41:51.083
which is called as madhurya, means melodious, melodious.

00:41:51.500 --> 00:41:56.041
We should talk in such a manner that it should be melodious.

00:41:56.542 --> 00:41:59.583
The person who listens to you,

00:42:00.041 --> 00:42:07.625
listens as if he’s listening to the flute of Shri Krishna.

00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:12.375
The voice of a Sahaja yogi should be sweet like that.

00:42:12.834 --> 00:42:18.166
When you talk to someone it should be melodious.

00:42:18.750 --> 00:42:20.709
It should not be aggressive, at all,

00:42:21.125 --> 00:42:24.083
but on the contrary it should be melodious.

00:42:24.583 --> 00:42:28.458
It should not be sarcastic; it should not hurt another person.

00:42:28.959 --> 00:42:33.542
Any word that hurts others cannot be coming

00:42:33.917 --> 00:42:36.500
from the proper type of Right Vishuddhi.

00:42:36.917 --> 00:42:40.667
So in no way one should hurt.

00:42:41.208 --> 00:42:45.875
I wish all the Sahaja yogis develop that melodious voice

00:42:46.166 --> 00:42:49.834
of Shri Krishna as their Vishuddhi is awakened.

00:42:50.166 --> 00:42:56.417
Madhurya, in his behavior, madhurya is – you see,

00:42:56.792 --> 00:43:01.417
while talking to someone there are so many gestures by which

00:43:01.834 --> 00:43:05.625
you can express your madhurya.

00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:11.250
For example, specially in Italy and other places,

00:43:11.667 --> 00:43:13.458
I’ve seen people use too much of their hands.

00:43:13.875 --> 00:43:15.542
This is also Shri Krishna’s style.

00:43:15.999 --> 00:43:17.750
So they use their hands in such a way

00:43:18.125 --> 00:43:21.834
that sometimes you don’t understand what they are meaning.

00:43:22.250 --> 00:43:24.500
And sometimes it can be quite aggressive also,

00:43:24.917 --> 00:43:26.500
the way they use their hands.

00:43:26.917 --> 00:43:29.834
Now, the hands must be used in such a way

00:43:30.250 --> 00:43:33.250
that it should create madhurya.

00:43:33.709 --> 00:43:38.834
I’ve seen this in Russia or specially in Eastern blocs

00:43:39.208 --> 00:43:42.625
where people, they have to express their love

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.750
– [just put like this, it’s cold] – if they have to say namaste.

00:43:48.166 --> 00:43:50.709
The whole expression is so sweet,

00:43:51.125 --> 00:43:57.375
and also their heart is very full when they see Me.

00:43:57.792 --> 00:43:59.834
So they don’t know how to express it.

00:44:00.208 --> 00:44:04.542
So they just put their hands like this.

00:44:04.999 --> 00:44:07.166
Or they feel shy, they do like this.

00:44:07.709 --> 00:44:11.792
Very, very sweet things they express through their hands,

00:44:12.083 --> 00:44:17.583
through their eyes. It is the tears, you see,

00:44:17.999 --> 00:44:25.625
that really create such clouds of, I should say,

00:44:25.959 --> 00:44:28.667
very dense clouds of compassion in My heart

00:44:29.083 --> 00:44:33.625
when I see their eyes expressing their love for Me.

00:44:34.083 --> 00:44:39.333
Everything, the tears, everything, that’s the face,

00:44:39.750 --> 00:44:44.917
the eyes, the hands, all these belong to Shri Krishna.

00:44:45.375 --> 00:44:48.542
So in their behavior, in their talking,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.667
how they express themselves.

00:44:53.166 --> 00:44:54.875
You can use the same eyes

00:44:55.291 --> 00:44:57.333
for showing your temper and getting angry.

00:44:57.792 --> 00:45:00.583
Many people use eyes for controlling others.

00:45:00.999 --> 00:45:04.458
They’ll put their eyes like this, stare at someone, try to control.

00:45:04.959 --> 00:45:11.166
They may use their eyes also for condemning someone.

00:45:11.667 --> 00:45:15.999
Also sometimes they use, sort of spit at someone

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:22.625
or try to show the tongue to insult someone.

00:45:23.083 --> 00:45:29.917
So in the behavior also we must have a kind of a sweetness.

00:45:30.333 --> 00:45:33.500
Like when I went to, went to England first,

00:45:33.999 --> 00:45:36.834
I was, you see, I learnt English in My own way.

00:45:37.208 --> 00:45:39.291
But when I went there newly they said,

00:45:39.625 --> 00:45:41.709
“Now, if you have to say word like ‘thought’

00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.709
you must say ‘thought’.” I said, “What?”

00:45:45.083 --> 00:45:48.417
“You must take out your tongue and say ‘thought’”.

00:45:48.792 --> 00:45:52.250
I said, “Is absurd. Why should you take out your tongue?”

00:45:52.667 --> 00:45:55.792
He said, “Unless and until you take out your tongue like that

00:45:56.125 --> 00:46:00.583
is not something, proper expression.”

00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000
So I said, “This is English. You have developed

00:46:03.375 --> 00:46:06.458
some nonsensical things, to show tongue at it, everyone.”

00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:08.792
Even a child, you know, when he gets angry

00:46:09.125 --> 00:46:10.458
automatically he shows his tongue.

00:46:10.834 --> 00:46:16.917
So you see all these expressions are – and making faces now,

00:46:17.291 --> 00:46:20.458
as they say that ‘stiff upper lip,’ you see.

00:46:20.792 --> 00:46:24.000
You must have heard about that, with a nose like that, you see,

00:46:24.333 --> 00:46:27.458
snooty nose or a face where you just make your faces

00:46:27.917 --> 00:46:34.083
and make a crooked face just to tease someone

00:46:34.542 --> 00:46:39.208
or to make an expression out of your nose.

00:46:39.583 --> 00:46:41.000
Also people do it like this, you see,

00:46:41.375 --> 00:46:44.291
to show as if you are sneezing at that person.

00:46:44.792 --> 00:46:47.333
All these things, expressions, are coming

00:46:47.834 --> 00:46:54.458
out of Shri Krishna’s grace, but the power of that is madhurya,

00:46:54.999 --> 00:46:58.250
is the sweetness, the melodiousness;

00:46:58.750 --> 00:47:04.709
the rapport should be so sweet that that rapport should create

00:47:05.166 --> 00:47:08.333
tremendous joy and tremendous happiness.

00:47:08.750 --> 00:47:13.166
As you have heard the song of Baba Mama’s on My eyes:

00:47:13.583 --> 00:47:17.667
only I looked at him, I say with that glance

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.125
– that generated that beautiful music in him.

00:47:21.583 --> 00:47:25.542
So, as far as possible, as far as possible,

00:47:25.959 --> 00:47:29.458
try to put your eyes on the greenery; that’s the best.

00:47:29.959 --> 00:47:34.375
Then it soothes down and also you develop

00:47:34.834 --> 00:47:37.542
the soothing quality of the greenery.

00:47:37.999 --> 00:47:40.625
I always tell people that “Better see the greenery around,

00:47:41.041 --> 00:47:42.291
how it soothes your eyes.”

00:47:42.792 --> 00:47:46.291
In the same way you should try to soothe

00:47:47.083 --> 00:47:49.542
the other person when you talk to that person.

00:47:49.917 --> 00:47:51.500
The person must melt.

00:47:51.875 --> 00:47:55.792
Instead of that, if you start arguing and fighting with that person,

00:47:56.208 --> 00:47:57.375
that person will never melt.

00:47:57.709 --> 00:48:01.834
On the contrary, you’ll be adding fire, more fire to that person.

00:48:02.333 --> 00:48:06.166
That was the quality of Shri Krishna, is the madhurya,

00:48:06.625 --> 00:48:11.417
and that it is expressed in His lifetime

00:48:11.834 --> 00:48:15.875
how He beautifully managed to say things

00:48:16.250 --> 00:48:22.500
in His own sweetness, specially in His childhood.

00:48:23.291 --> 00:48:26.834
The another quality which Shri Krishna has, which

00:48:27.166 --> 00:48:33.333
we can express through our Right Vishuddhi, is diplomacy.

00:48:33.667 --> 00:48:35.667
But there are two types of diplomacies:

00:48:36.041 --> 00:48:38.542
one is genuine; one who is artificial.

00:48:38.999 --> 00:48:43.667
In the genuine diplomacy you do not have to take to

00:48:44.041 --> 00:48:48.041
a certain standard or you don’t have to read some books

00:48:48.542 --> 00:48:51.750
to know what is diplomacy.

00:48:52.166 --> 00:48:55.333
Is a genuinely it comes to you.

00:48:55.750 --> 00:48:59.000
It, the whole thing works very sweetly,

00:48:59.458 --> 00:49:02.458
in such a genuine manner.

00:49:02.917 --> 00:49:05.667
I, I have used it many-a-times Myself,

00:49:06.041 --> 00:49:08.500
and you all can use it also many-a-times.

00:49:08.875 --> 00:49:11.917
That’s only possible if you don’t get angry with them;

00:49:12.333 --> 00:49:15.041
not possible if you are angry.

00:49:15.542 --> 00:49:19.500
Now, there’s a story I’ve told you about some,

00:49:19.959 --> 00:49:21.291
this Gagangiri Maharaj.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:24.709
I went to meet him and he was very angry

00:49:25.125 --> 00:49:26.834
because he could not stop the rain.

00:49:27.333 --> 00:49:28.625
He was supposed to stop the rain.

00:49:28.999 --> 00:49:30.583
And I was all drenched.

00:49:30.959 --> 00:49:32.667
And he was so angry and he said that

00:49:32.999 --> 00:49:35.250
“Is it my ego You are trying to control?”

00:49:35.583 --> 00:49:38.166
and like that he started little bit fighting with Me.

00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:40.458
I said, “No, that’s not the reason.”

00:49:40.959 --> 00:49:44.166
He said, “Why? Why did You not allow me to stop the rain?

00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:45.333
You are all drenched.”

00:49:45.667 --> 00:49:48.208
I said, “Because you are a sanyasi

00:49:48.542 --> 00:49:49.834
and you bought a sari for Me.

00:49:50.125 --> 00:49:51.999
I would not take a sari from a sanyasi.

00:49:52.375 --> 00:49:54.458
So I had to get drenched, for your sake.”

00:49:54.959 --> 00:49:59.417
The whole thing finished off.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.208
The whole anger, temper, finished off.

00:50:03.750 --> 00:50:06.542
This is how we have to melt people.

00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:12.208
The diplomacy is not convincing anybody

00:50:12.583 --> 00:50:16.375
with his intellect or by temper or anything

00:50:16.792 --> 00:50:22.709
but it is to melt away another person by your goodness,

00:50:23.208 --> 00:50:25.542
by your good words, by your sweet words,

00:50:25.959 --> 00:50:27.792
by your forgiving nature.

00:50:28.208 --> 00:50:32.875
This quality He had and He tried this on many people.

00:50:33.250 --> 00:50:35.999
It worked on some; it did not work on some.

00:50:36.458 --> 00:50:38.000
He didn’t feel it’s a failure.

00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.500
It’s the reaction of the another person

00:50:40.917 --> 00:50:43.000
which is important to be seen.

00:50:43.375 --> 00:50:46.917
So this quality of Right Vishuddhi you should have,

00:50:47.291 --> 00:50:52.083
is to talk to others and melt them away.

00:50:52.417 --> 00:50:56.542
I hope in America people develop this quality

00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.875
and try to improve relations with each other.

00:51:01.208 --> 00:51:04.208
Actually, to talk to they are very sweet, I must say.

00:51:04.667 --> 00:51:06.250
They get very friendly with you.

00:51:06.625 --> 00:51:08.250
You give them any number of presents,

00:51:08.625 --> 00:51:11.291
they’ll be very happy but they’ll never give you any present.

00:51:11.709 --> 00:51:13.667
You call them for dinner, anything,

00:51:14.083 --> 00:51:16.834
they’ll ten times they will come to your house for dinner

00:51:17.250 --> 00:51:19.166
but they will never call you for dinner.

00:51:19.625 --> 00:51:22.041
You see, they are very friendly as long

00:51:22.417 --> 00:51:23.959
as you are doing anything for them.

00:51:24.375 --> 00:51:27.917
But when it comes to returning it they find it difficult;

00:51:28.333 --> 00:51:31.917
they don’t do it. So, you see the whole thing amounts

00:51:32.208 --> 00:51:35.542
to be a very sweet exploitation of another person.

00:51:36.041 --> 00:51:38.959
This is what is to be understood that by sweetness

00:51:39.375 --> 00:51:42.750
you are not going to exploit anyone but by sweetness

00:51:43.125 --> 00:51:47.000
you are going to melt that person and bring him to the level

00:51:47.417 --> 00:51:52.834
that he can understand what is goodness.

00:51:53.500 --> 00:51:56.291
Now, about South America, I’ve already told you

00:51:56.792 --> 00:52:01.375
that they are extremely simple and innocent people.

00:52:01.792 --> 00:52:04.667
They are very poor, simple, innocent,

00:52:05.125 --> 00:52:08.125
but what has entered them into is this black magic,

00:52:08.625 --> 00:52:12.417
and which they are now realizing, luckily,

00:52:12.834 --> 00:52:15.625
that this is black magic which is troubling them.

00:52:16.083 --> 00:52:18.542
But somehow they have depended on it so much,

00:52:18.959 --> 00:52:20.041
on the left side.

00:52:20.375 --> 00:52:22.667
They feel very guilty about it; they feel very bad.

00:52:22.999 --> 00:52:25.375
All the time you find them absolutely guilty.

00:52:25.834 --> 00:52:27.333
Their whole behavior is that

00:52:27.792 --> 00:52:29.875
as if they have done something wrong

00:52:30.291 --> 00:52:33.166
but they do not know how to correct themselves.

00:52:33.625 --> 00:52:38.208
So for us is important not to feel guilty about anything.

00:52:38.667 --> 00:52:41.250
We are all Sahaja yogis.

00:52:41.667 --> 00:52:44.333
How can we have guilt after all, when we are the spirit?

00:52:44.709 --> 00:52:46.458
Spirit cannot have the guilt.

00:52:46.875 --> 00:52:48.709
So this guilt has to go away.

00:52:49.083 --> 00:52:54.208
But by guilt what do we do, what we lose is the witness power,

00:52:54.667 --> 00:52:57.750
because when there is a guilt we put it here, the guilt is there.

00:52:58.166 --> 00:53:00.667
But we cannot see.

00:53:01.041 --> 00:53:04.375
We cannot witness what’s wrong

00:53:04.834 --> 00:53:06.792
and we do not want to face the difficulty,

00:53:07.083 --> 00:53:10.999
our mistakes or the difficulty we have.

00:53:11.417 --> 00:53:13.500
Just put it as a guilt here, finished.

00:53:13.834 --> 00:53:15.834
Is stored up there nicely, guilt.

00:53:16.250 --> 00:53:17.917
But we do not want to face it.

00:53:18.291 --> 00:53:22.417
For example a man, say, or a woman is very cruel by nature.

00:53:22.792 --> 00:53:26.333
Then suddenly she realizes that she has been cruel

00:53:26.750 --> 00:53:28.709
or whatever it is. So she puts it down there,

00:53:29.041 --> 00:53:30.917
“Oh, I’ve been very bad. I’ve been very cruel,

00:53:31.250 --> 00:53:35.083
this thing, that thing.” But she doesn’t face it.

00:53:35.458 --> 00:53:37.875
Facing means she should know, “Why was I cruel?

00:53:38.166 --> 00:53:40.333
What was the need for me? I should not have been cruel

00:53:40.750 --> 00:53:44.166
and now I will not be cruel anymore.” That finishes off.

00:53:44.583 --> 00:53:48.125
But, “I’m very guilty about it. I’m very guilty about it,”

00:53:48.625 --> 00:53:50.583
doesn’t help. On the contrary, you know,

00:53:50.875 --> 00:53:52.500
what are the problems are of the guilt,

00:53:52.875 --> 00:53:57.208
and the same problems are today faced by South America.

00:53:57.750 --> 00:54:00.583
When I went there I was surprised that in Brazil

00:54:01.000 --> 00:54:06.375
the man who was the topmost there talked to Me in a manner,

00:54:06.792 --> 00:54:09.208
“Oh, we are, we know we have lots of defects.

00:54:09.667 --> 00:54:11.709
We know we are no good,” this, that.

00:54:12.166 --> 00:54:15.333
What I just say, why doesn’t he correct?

00:54:18.625 --> 00:54:20.917
If he knows this is the mistake, this is the thing,

00:54:21.291 --> 00:54:23.458
why shouldn’t he correct? Then he told Me that

00:54:23.875 --> 00:54:26.375
“You write to me all the things You found wrong with us.”

00:54:26.834 --> 00:54:28.583
And it was really very sweet of him.

00:54:29.041 --> 00:54:32.625
So then one journalist came and we told him.

00:54:32.959 --> 00:54:35.083
And now I think they are doing something about it.

00:54:35.417 --> 00:54:38.000
They are trying to improve it and things will improve definitely.

00:54:38.500 --> 00:54:43.000
But on the contrary I found that Russia is very different.

00:54:43.333 --> 00:54:46.583
In Russia they never said, “We are guilty,” or anything,

00:54:46.999 --> 00:54:49.542
nothing of the kind. They never said so.

00:54:49.999 --> 00:54:51.834
They said, “That time is over now.

00:54:52.166 --> 00:54:55.417
We are in the kingdom of God. Finished.

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:59.792
So that is over. We are now in the Kingdom of God

00:55:00.125 --> 00:55:03.834
and we have to enjoy life.” Everything positive.

00:55:04.166 --> 00:55:06.417
Never talked of their past, of their governments

00:55:06.792 --> 00:55:11.333
or this happened, or Stalin or Lenin or anyone.

00:55:11.792 --> 00:55:14.875
They were not concerned. They were above it.

00:55:15.291 --> 00:55:17.583
“So why should we worry?” They said, “Why should we worry?

00:55:17.917 --> 00:55:19.417
Let them fight. Let them do what they like.”

00:55:19.834 --> 00:55:22.458
They don’t want to know anything about their politics,

00:55:22.875 --> 00:55:25.792
about their problems or anything.

00:55:26.208 --> 00:55:28.000
They think, “Our problems are solved.

00:55:28.417 --> 00:55:30.166
We are now realized souls.

00:55:30.583 --> 00:55:33.375
We are enjoying ourselves. Let us enjoy.”

00:55:33.792 --> 00:55:37.000
Very straight-forward way of understanding Sahaja Yoga.

00:55:37.500 --> 00:55:39.458
But I’ve seen people, they write to Me

00:55:39.834 --> 00:55:42.250
ten pages of their confessions as if I am a priest,

00:55:42.667 --> 00:55:46.000
Catholic priest, you see, all about their, what they have done,

00:55:46.375 --> 00:55:48.458
this they have done, and I don’t want to read it.

00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:51.583
Just throw it or I burn it off.

00:55:52.041 --> 00:55:54.542
So they try to confess. There’s no need to confess.

00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:58.709
There’s nothing to say. And not to dwell upon

00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.250
what wrongs you have done, but now enjoy what you have got it.

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:06.208
It’s like this: supposing a beggar is made a king, all right?

00:56:06.625 --> 00:56:09.999
Then he should enjoy his kingdom, should behave like a king.

00:56:10.375 --> 00:56:12.333
But still he remembers his past more,

00:56:12.750 --> 00:56:14.291
so anybody who passes by he says,

00:56:14.625 --> 00:56:18.625
“Give me five rupees or five pounds.” It’s like that.

00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:20.999
Once you are in the Kingdom of God,

00:56:21.375 --> 00:56:23.458
know that you are in the Kingdom of God.

00:56:23.917 --> 00:56:28.750
But this black magic business is very, very dangerous

00:56:29.166 --> 00:56:30.834
and it can act through anyone.

00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:34.166
It can act through your relations, act through your friends,

00:56:34.542 --> 00:56:35.875
act through anyone.

00:56:36.166 --> 00:56:39.458
So one has to be very careful that you do not become,

00:56:39.834 --> 00:56:42.709
because of your guilt business or whatever it is,

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:46.792
you become vulnerable to black magic.

00:56:47.250 --> 00:56:49.875
It can ruin you. It can ruin your families.

00:56:50.291 --> 00:56:53.208
Even if you are a Sahaja yogi it can ruin you.

00:56:53.750 --> 00:56:57.291
So this guilt business has to be given up completely.

00:56:57.709 --> 00:57:00.208
You should not be guilty. Guilt is put into you.

00:57:00.625 --> 00:57:02.291
Somebody can say, “Oh you are so bad.

00:57:02.709 --> 00:57:05.583
You didn’t do this for me. You didn’t do that,”

00:57:05.917 --> 00:57:07.834
or something like that. They put ideas.

00:57:08.208 --> 00:57:10.500
Then you start feeling, “Oh, I should have done this for them.

00:57:10.792 --> 00:57:13.750
I should have. It was wrong on my part,” or something,

00:57:14.041 --> 00:57:15.000
and then the guilt starts.

00:57:15.375 --> 00:57:17.166
Instead of doing something for that person

00:57:17.625 --> 00:57:20.458
or instead of understanding that this all nonsense,

00:57:20.917 --> 00:57:23.999
they go on brooding on that, brooding and then suddenly

00:57:24.333 --> 00:57:30.250
they find they are in the trouble of getting possessed

00:57:30.667 --> 00:57:33.417
or being affected by black magic.

00:57:33.875 --> 00:57:37.583
So one has to forget it and get into the atmosphere

00:57:37.999 --> 00:57:43.000
where you know that you are now in the kingdom of God.

00:57:43.542 --> 00:57:47.083
For Shri Krishna, whatever is to be said is less than

00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:49.583
what He’s said always, I always feel,

00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:57.000
and that His main work is through our brain.

00:57:57.500 --> 00:58:01.542
That is Virata. He works through our brain.

00:58:02.041 --> 00:58:04.291
And as Shiva works through our heart,

00:58:04.667 --> 00:58:06.500
He works through our brain.

00:58:06.999 --> 00:58:12.583
And after Sahaja Yoga, after enlightenment,

00:58:12.999 --> 00:58:16.583
all the subtleties of the brain and the knowledge

00:58:17.083 --> 00:58:20.709
starts manifesting and expressing itself.

00:58:21.083 --> 00:58:22.959
But the greatest thing that happens,

00:58:23.291 --> 00:58:25.166
that integration takes place in your brain.

00:58:25.583 --> 00:58:27.458
It’s not that your heart wants one thing

00:58:27.917 --> 00:58:29.792
and your brain wants another thing.

00:58:30.208 --> 00:58:31.625
The integration takes place.

00:58:31.959 --> 00:58:33.542
And when that integration takes place

00:58:33.959 --> 00:58:37.208
it’s so easy to lead a very dharmic life.

00:58:37.667 --> 00:58:41.999
Even without thinking about it, without reading about it,

00:58:42.333 --> 00:58:44.291
you just become dharmic.

00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:46.625
You are not to be told that you have to be dharmic.

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.208
Innately you become dharmic because your brain,

00:58:50.667 --> 00:58:54.834
which normally is used for rationality,

00:58:55.291 --> 00:58:57.166
for justifying all that is wrong,

00:58:57.625 --> 00:59:01.917
becomes dharmic, becomes divine.

00:59:02.291 --> 00:59:05.792
This is the greatest thing that Shri Krishna does to you

00:59:06.208 --> 00:59:11.083
is to make your brain, brain itself dharmic.

00:59:11.542 --> 00:59:20.625
It becomes a vehicle of understanding Dharma,

00:59:21.458 --> 00:59:30.834
of leading a dharmic life and of standing firmly on Dharma.

00:59:31.291 --> 00:59:37.875
It’s the brain; it is the brain which really,

00:59:38.375 --> 00:59:44.375
mostly, takes you away from Dharma, apart from black magic.

00:59:44.959 --> 00:59:49.667
But once your Sahasrara is opened out,

00:59:50.166 --> 00:59:55.667
Virata is expressed.

00:59:56.083 --> 00:59:58.250
Then you are amazed at yourself.

00:59:58.625 --> 01:00:01.000
The one who was indulging into everything thinking,

01:00:01.333 --> 01:00:04.000
“This is pleasure. This is my right. I should have done it.

01:00:04.458 --> 01:00:06.083
Who else can tell me?” and all that,

01:00:06.417 --> 01:00:09.375
suddenly you become a prophet.

01:00:09.792 --> 01:00:12.959
This is the greatest blessing of Shri Krishna

01:00:13.291 --> 01:00:18.500
that He is Virat, and the Virat is your brain,

01:00:18.999 --> 01:00:23.083
and the brain of God Almighty is Virat.

01:00:23.542 --> 01:00:26.125
So this is what one has to realize,

01:00:26.500 --> 01:00:29.999
that after realization a person gets ideas

01:00:30.333 --> 01:00:33.959
which are always constructive, and if they are not,

01:00:34.208 --> 01:00:35.959
then you are not yet a Sahaja yogi.

01:00:36.417 --> 01:00:40.709
Constructive and dharmic, that is very, very important

01:00:41.083 --> 01:00:45.959
for us to understand, where is our mind going?

01:00:46.417 --> 01:00:53.250
Is it contradicting, it is telling something else than what it is?

01:00:53.917 --> 01:00:58.417
We have to just keep a watch and you’ll be amazed to see

01:00:58.792 --> 01:01:02.792
how your brain has changed its ways.

01:01:03.291 --> 01:01:06.875
The upside brain has become normal.

01:01:07.291 --> 01:01:13.999
This you can get very easily if you just meditate

01:01:14.458 --> 01:01:20.458
every day and see for yourself how the expression

01:01:20.917 --> 01:01:26.083
of your Sahasrara is penetrating into your being

01:01:26.542 --> 01:01:29.542
and is acting in your life.

01:01:29.959 --> 01:01:33.750
Then all the powers of Sahaja yogi will be manifested

01:01:34.208 --> 01:01:38.208
and you don’t have to anymore doubt yourself,

01:01:38.583 --> 01:01:40.917
and others will never doubt you.

01:01:41.208 --> 01:01:43.500
May God bless you.
