WEBVTT

17:42.959 --> 17:48.500
It’s a unique opportunity today
to do Vishnumaya Puja

17:48.834 --> 17:54.125
because She entered into this
house, we have to worship Her.

17:57.999 --> 18:00.750
First we should know
who is Vishnumaya.

18:00.959 --> 18:05.291
It’s very important to know
because in the Devi Mahatmyam

18:05.542 --> 18:13.291
She is only described as
the Incarnation of the Goddess,

18:13.542 --> 18:17.583
Vishnumaye di shabdita.
She is called as Vishnumaya.

18:17.917 --> 18:23.083
But let’s see who is She, after
all, this Vishnumaya is who?

18:25.166 --> 18:29.583
So Vishnumaya is the Kali,
we can say,

18:29.792 --> 18:34.959
and is the daughter of Mahakali.
She came on this earth

18:35.125 --> 18:39.250
and killed many, many devils
and many rakshasas

18:39.458 --> 18:43.166
to save the saints from
their aggression

18:43.375 --> 18:46.750
and She always acts
in that manner

18:46.959 --> 18:50.750
to kill all the negativity
of the world.

18:51.083 --> 18:54.291
She is very quick at it, I should
say, and She knows

18:54.542 --> 19:00.875
where is the negativity and She
tries to burn that negativity

19:01.125 --> 19:04.083
as fast as possible.

19:06.709 --> 19:11.709
Now the origin is like this
that this Vishnumaya

19:11.917 --> 19:24.291
was the daughter of Mahakali who
was created by Mahakali Herself

19:24.709 --> 19:31.583
to fight these demons but also
She was given special

19:31.792 --> 19:41.375
weapons to do this work. But at the
time of Shri Krishna She was born

19:41.583 --> 19:51.959
as the sister of Shri Krishna, and
instead of Shri Krishna being killed

19:52.291 --> 19:55.792
by Her uncle, as you
know the story is,

19:56.291 --> 20:00.999
She was exchanged, She was
actually the daughter of Yeshoda,

20:01.208 --> 20:06.542
exchanged for Shri Krishna.
And this girl, little girl

20:06.750 --> 20:10.458
was killed by the uncle
of Shri Krishna,

20:10.709 --> 20:17.709
who became the lightning in
the sky and announced that,

20:17.959 --> 20:24.166
“Shri Krishna has already
incarnated, and your destiny

20:24.375 --> 20:29.041
is in His hands and He is going
to kill you,” She told Kamsa.

20:29.792 --> 20:34.375
So this is the Vishnumaya. Then
again She took Her birth

20:34.667 --> 20:39.750
at the time of Shri Krishna
when He was,

20:46.792 --> 20:51.166
he was the King of
Dwarika,

20:51.792 --> 20:59.375
and She married, I should say,
these five Pandavas.

21:00.417 --> 21:04.417
Because She was Draupadi.
There’s a significance in that,

21:04.667 --> 21:11.959
that this is the one which
joins five elements.

21:12.208 --> 21:16.083
And these five Pandavas
represented five elements

21:16.333 --> 21:21.917
and so She joined them as
one wife because She’s the one

21:22.125 --> 21:25.083
who joins all the
five elements

21:25.333 --> 21:29.291
that have created this
material universe.

21:29.750 --> 21:41.625
Thus, we have a relationship
established with Shri Krishna,

21:41.917 --> 21:47.375
and Shri Krishna as you know
that, treated Her as a sister.

21:47.999 --> 21:55.417
Now once when you know that
they tried to insult Draupadi

21:55.709 --> 22:00.959
by pulling out Her saris, it was
Shri Krishna who helped Her

22:01.125 --> 22:04.750
because She was His sister
and such a powerful lady.

22:04.959 --> 22:09.417
She’s also responsible
for the Mahabharata.

22:09.667 --> 22:13.792
She’s the one who brought forth,
She’s the one who told that,

22:13.999 --> 22:16.667
“You have to fight
these Pandavas.”

22:16.917 --> 22:22.083
She absolutely told them very clearly
that, “You have to fight the Kauravas

22:22.333 --> 22:26.375
and in such a way that they
should be defeated not only

22:26.583 --> 22:28.709
but they should be
destroyed.”

22:28.959 --> 22:32.333
Because the chastity of
woman is very important

22:32.583 --> 22:38.083
and in India anybody who tries
to molest the chastity of woman

22:38.250 --> 22:41.166
is to be cursed, is to
be destroyed.

22:41.375 --> 22:46.083
And this was a very great
message of Mahabharata

22:46.333 --> 22:49.166
that only because She
was insulted so much,

22:49.417 --> 22:54.625
all the war took place and
all of them were destroyed.

22:58.417 --> 23:03.083
So this is the story
of Vishnumaya,

23:03.291 --> 23:06.750
but as all the Deities are
now in Adi Shakti residing,

23:06.959 --> 23:11.834
She is on your left
Vishuddhi reflected.

23:12.458 --> 23:15.208
And the left Vishuddhi
is very important

23:15.417 --> 23:23.709
because we have
problems of our Ego.

23:24.959 --> 23:29.458
And you really need
someone to remind us

23:29.667 --> 23:35.667
that we should not have
this Ego to oppress others.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.667
So this reminder comes to us
maybe from our conscience

23:38.917 --> 23:42.875
or wherever it is, you may say, from
our upbringing, and settles down

23:43.041 --> 23:47.875
in our left Vishuddhi
as the clouds of guilt.

23:49.250 --> 23:51.999
Also, as you know, Catholic Church
and all these people,

23:52.208 --> 23:54.917
every religion start saying
that, “You are a sinner”

23:55.083 --> 24:00.917
and all this settles down in the
left side of your Vishuddhi chakra.

24:01.458 --> 24:06.000
So the guilt is there. Now the guilt
is there, then it is there,

24:06.208 --> 24:11.792
She is sitting down. This guilt
when rubs against each other

24:11.999 --> 24:15.625
as the clouds in the sky,

24:15.834 --> 24:21.083
Vishnumaya gives you
a feeling of burning,

24:21.291 --> 24:28.542
She burns the bhoots there, She
burns our guilt and also She removes

24:28.834 --> 24:32.999
our doubts about ourself
with Her light.

24:33.709 --> 24:36.208
But in the beginning in Sahaja Yoga,
as you’ve seen, when the Kundalini rises

24:36.417 --> 24:37.917
when the Kundalini rises

24:38.083 --> 24:42.125
you feel always the left side,
very clearly,

24:42.375 --> 24:45.166
the pain or sometimes
the burning.

24:45.375 --> 24:48.834
And sometimes people say,
“Mother, why am I feeling

24:49.000 --> 24:51.291
such burning here when
the Kundalini is rising?”

24:51.500 --> 24:54.999
Because is the Vishnumaya,
She’s trying to burn them out.

24:55.208 --> 24:59.333
This is one of Her capacities,
to burn. Some of them,

24:59.542 --> 25:03.999
like we can say, the water
element can dissolve,

25:04.583 --> 25:09.500
then the ice can soothe
you down, but Vishnumaya

25:09.709 --> 25:15.250
is an element like electricity,
which really puts you

25:15.542 --> 25:24.792
into proper shape by burning
away your negativities.

25:25.000 --> 25:29.542
Is very surprising that
this power of Vishnumaya

25:29.792 --> 25:35.083
is of the left side and
despite that it has that fire

25:35.333 --> 25:38.083
in itself that it can
burn away the,

25:39.417 --> 25:44.333
I should say, the negativity
bhoots on the left hand side.

25:44.667 --> 25:48.041
Now let us see how we develop
these left hand side bhoots,

25:48.250 --> 25:50.792
it’s very interesting, because
as we are dealing

25:50.999 --> 25:52.834
with Vishnumaya we should
co-operate with Her

25:52.999 --> 25:56.458
and should not have any
more pains upon us.

25:56.709 --> 25:59.999
It comes to us specially
in the West.

26:00.208 --> 26:03.959
I mean in India I don’t
think anybody

26:04.166 --> 26:05.667
feels guilty about anything. It’s
something that very surprising,

26:05.917 --> 26:08.542
I’ve never seen any
Indian feeling guilty.

26:09.667 --> 26:15.083
The reason is, that if they have
done a mistake, in India,you know,

26:15.333 --> 26:20.834
the culture is such that "this is bad
manners, that is bad manners," like that.

26:22.500 --> 26:25.875
Now if somebody by mistake

26:27.125 --> 26:31.500
does something, then he can
bear a grunt against that person

26:31.750 --> 26:34.750
but he’ll never feel guilty that,
“I’ve hurt that person,”

26:34.959 --> 26:36.417
or “I’ve said something
wrong,”

26:36.625 --> 26:38.000
or “I should not have
said that,”

26:38.250 --> 26:41.750
because in the whole culture
there is nothing like “sorry”

26:42.000 --> 26:45.500
and “thank you”. It’s funny
culture Indian is.

26:45.750 --> 26:47.834
There’s nothing like
saying “sorry”

26:48.000 --> 26:50.291
and so much “thank you”
also they don’t say.

26:50.500 --> 26:53.041
And all the time saying,
“Thank you”, and “Good morning”,

26:53.291 --> 26:59.291
“Good evening”, I mean all the time, it’s
more sort of a artificial thing for us.

26:59.542 --> 27:02.500
Even in Maharashtra the women
never even say “Namaste”

27:02.709 --> 27:08.583
except to the Goddess or to God or
to Incarnations, or in the temples.

27:08.792 --> 27:13.083
They’ll never say to some man,
“Namaskar” like this - just like this

27:13.333 --> 27:15.917
or they might just
smile, that’s all.

27:16.125 --> 27:19.750
So it is because we have
to only bow to God.

27:19.999 --> 27:22.834
Why should we say
“Good morning” to everyone,

27:23.041 --> 27:24.291
“Good evening” to
everyone?

27:24.542 --> 27:26.208
We should we say,
“Good morning” only to God.

27:26.458 --> 27:32.083
You see that’s the situation,
it is the way it is being done.

27:32.417 --> 27:36.458
Now if you have done anything
wrong, say in the East,

27:36.709 --> 27:42.750
I mean in India, as it is - if you
have done anything in a way

27:42.999 --> 27:48.999
that you should not have done.
So there are only two ways

27:49.542 --> 27:53.000
they deal with it, either they will
confess it and go that person,

27:53.250 --> 27:55.083
that “I have done this wrong,
now you can cut my throat,

27:55.291 --> 27:57.417
do what you like. Whatever
punishment you give me

27:58.125 --> 28:02.166
Whatever punishment you
give me I am willing to do."

28:02.792 --> 28:05.166
This is the first thing,
they’ll admit it,

28:05.458 --> 28:08.250
that “If you think that
I have done wrong

28:08.542 --> 28:10.500
you can slap me
immediately,

28:10.750 --> 28:12.875
I can pick up the slap.”

28:13.041 --> 28:17.041
Supposing you say something
rude to your father.

28:18.417 --> 28:20.750
It’s not to be said,
is bad manners

28:20.959 --> 28:22.083
because he is elder.

28:22.291 --> 28:29.166
If any elderly person has been
insulted then it is wrong,

28:29.417 --> 28:32.750
then you will go and touch the
feet of that person and say,

28:32.959 --> 28:35.999
“I am sorry, I’ve said this and
I hope you forgive me.”

28:36.208 --> 28:38.999
So the other person says
after that, “I forgive you.”

28:39.291 --> 28:43.041
I’ll give an example.
We were in Russia

28:43.500 --> 28:47.125
and a little problem started
between two persons.

28:47.375 --> 28:51.959
One was much younger and one
was much older, Sahaja Yogis.

28:52.208 --> 28:55.750
So the reaction I’m
telling you how it was.

29:04.375 --> 29:08.417
So the elder one came and complained
at two o’clock in the night

29:08.667 --> 29:11.542
that this man said that,

29:11.792 --> 29:14.333
“You don’t know what
I’m capable of.”

29:14.583 --> 29:18.667
I said, “Really. That’s, he should not
have said such a thing to you.”

29:19.417 --> 29:24.834
So I called that fellow,
woke him up at about 2:30.

29:25.041 --> 29:28.667
I said, “Why did you say
such a thing to him?

29:29.834 --> 29:32.291
You should not have
said. He is your elder,

29:32.500 --> 29:34.500
you cannot say like that.”

29:34.750 --> 29:40.750
“Because he said that, Mother, he talked
to me as if he would talk to his own servant.

29:40.999 --> 29:44.750
He didn’t talk to me in the way
he should have talked to me,

29:44.999 --> 29:47.166
so I said this.” But I said,
“Despite that

29:47.417 --> 29:51.542
you cannot say this to your elders,
you cannot say like that.”

29:51.750 --> 29:54.709
“Yes, of course, I know
I made a mistake

29:54.917 --> 29:57.375
and actually I was not
sleeping, I was not awakened,

29:57.583 --> 30:00.750
I was not sleeping, I was thinking
I should tomorrow morning go

30:00.959 --> 30:04.417
and ask for his forgiveness
and finish it.” I said, “Just now.”

30:04.667 --> 30:07.375
Immediately he got up and got
hold of his feet and he said,

30:07.583 --> 30:11.333
“Now forgive me, because you
were also too much of it.”

30:11.542 --> 30:13.500
He said, “I agree, that was
my mistake

30:13.709 --> 30:16.625
so you also forgive me.
” Finished!

30:19.792 --> 30:23.333
And in the West, formerly,
it was not so bad also.

30:23.542 --> 30:27.250
What they used to do supposing
there’s a quarrel between two men,

30:27.542 --> 30:31.625
they would use their boxing,
box each other nicely

30:31.834 --> 30:34.583
and everybody will box
each other. Finished!

30:36.999 --> 30:39.041
Nowadays you cannot
box anyone,

30:39.250 --> 30:42.500
you cannot ask for forgiveness,
and it’s too much of prestige,

30:42.709 --> 30:44.875
this, that, all these
artificial things

30:45.083 --> 30:46.375
have made you feel
guilty

30:46.583 --> 30:49.667
because you are supposed
to do that.

30:51.208 --> 30:53.417
If anybody
- it’s natural –

30:53.625 --> 30:55.834
if anybody has said
anything to you,

30:56.041 --> 30:57.417
you’ll just go and
box him and say,

30:57.625 --> 30:59.041
“Why did you say such
a thing to me?”

30:59.291 --> 31:02.792
and that fellow will box
you back and finished.

31:03.000 --> 31:05.083
Was a very common
style, you see

31:05.291 --> 31:07.375
all these old American
pictures

31:07.583 --> 31:11.333
you see all this, I’ve seen
it all the time.

31:29.792 --> 31:36.709
But this guilt business has come
because of sophistication.

31:37.875 --> 31:41.333
I used to think, “Why do they
feel guilty for everything?”

31:41.542 --> 31:44.166
First is sophistication,
first reason is.

31:44.375 --> 31:46.792
Because you cannot go
and say somebody,

31:46.999 --> 31:50.125
“Oh I’m sorry I’ve said this
and please forgive me,”

31:50.333 --> 31:53.834
and another person may
not even forgive.

31:54.041 --> 31:58.333
This is due to sophistication
and no communication.

31:58.542 --> 32:02.375
There’s no communication.
I mean in a country like India

32:02.583 --> 32:07.667
people will fight and next thing
you’ll see them hugging each other.

32:07.875 --> 32:12.999
It doesn’t last long, very
much. But if there is any,

32:13.166 --> 32:16.500
sort of a very big problem
between the families

32:16.709 --> 32:21.041
or someone something - an ancient
one then they’ll keep it up.

32:21.667 --> 32:24.875
They will not talk to that person,
they’ll keep their distance,

32:25.041 --> 32:27.917
they’ll keep it all the time.
But here it is not so.

32:28.083 --> 32:31.041
Superficially they’ll
meet everyone.

32:31.291 --> 32:33.999
Superficially they’ll
talk to everyone

32:34.166 --> 32:36.792
but inside they
have that guilt.

32:36.999 --> 32:40.125
So because of this superficial
sophistication

32:40.333 --> 32:44.208
what has happened that we
suffer from this left Vishuddhi

32:44.417 --> 32:46.208
and then Vishnumaya
gets angry.

32:46.458 --> 32:48.959
That’s why most of the people
in the West, I have seen,

32:49.166 --> 32:51.625
have left Vishuddhi
and even

32:51.875 --> 32:56.583
I have got it from you
all. It’s like that.

32:56.834 --> 33:00.041
So it’s nothing, it’s artificial,
it is mythical,

33:00.250 --> 33:01.917
nothing to feel guilty
about.

33:02.125 --> 33:04.999
After all even if you have
done anything wrong

33:05.166 --> 33:07.667
you would have been in jail.
You are sitting here,

33:07.959 --> 33:09.959
so how can you
be guilty.

33:10.166 --> 33:12.583
So this guilt business
has killed our growth

33:12.834 --> 33:16.250
in Sahaja Yoga very much,
I know that. So first of all –

33:16.458 --> 33:20.125
how to overcome your
ego is the problem.

33:22.000 --> 33:26.000
Ego is there and when you see
your ego and you cannot say

33:26.250 --> 33:31.208
that you are egoistical, you have
to put the result of that

33:31.417 --> 33:38.792
as a left Vishuddhi.
So the first thing

33:38.999 --> 33:43.417
you have to do is to see
that you have ego.

33:43.834 --> 33:46.375
All right, then you stand
before the mirror,

33:46.583 --> 33:48.542
separate yourself from
your reflection

33:48.750 --> 33:51.792
and start telling off your
own reflection,

33:51.999 --> 33:53.667
“Now what do you mean by
having ego in yourself?

33:53.875 --> 33:56.959
You are a Sahaja Yogi - you have
no business to have any ego.”

33:57.125 --> 34:01.583
But if you have the guilt you
will never see you have the ego.

34:01.834 --> 34:05.333
You will just feel the guilt but
never see you have the ego.

34:05.583 --> 34:10.333
And that’s how ego remains and
the left Vishuddhi also remains.

34:10.625 --> 34:12.583
Both things can be
easily conquered

34:12.834 --> 34:15.125
if you face yourself,
just see yourself.

34:15.333 --> 34:19.166
“This was my ego? Yes.
Why should I have ego?”

34:19.458 --> 34:24.083
Now there are ways of removing
all these imbalances

34:24.375 --> 34:27.333
within ourselves through
Sahaja Yoga. It’s not difficult.

34:27.542 --> 34:30.166
And has been removed.
So you know right side,

34:30.375 --> 34:33.417
left side - it’s so simple. Sahaja
Yoga is just movement

34:33.667 --> 34:36.959
of your fingers and hands,
that’s all.

34:37.250 --> 34:39.917
It’s not a thing diagnosis,

34:40.083 --> 34:42.166
where they take out your
blood, take out your tongue,

34:42.417 --> 34:46.291
take out your eyes and
declare that you are healthy.

34:47.166 --> 34:49.999
It’s not that way. It just,
you can feel it,

34:50.166 --> 34:51.709
that you are all right,
you are in balance.

34:51.917 --> 34:54.166
Once that balance
is established

34:54.417 --> 34:57.750
there is no problem
with Vishnumaya.

34:57.959 --> 35:03.125
So this Vishnumaya who was
the sister of Shri Krishna

35:03.375 --> 35:06.999
and later on came as Draupadi and
all that is today also existing

35:07.166 --> 35:12.208
in this light, and in
your left Vishuddhi.

35:14.625 --> 35:19.917
But people do not want to
see what’s wrong with them.

35:20.083 --> 35:24.333
This is the big problem. Like in
York they had a church

35:24.583 --> 35:28.083
where a bishop of Durham,
useless fellow,

35:28.333 --> 35:31.709
he declared that Christ
was an ordinary man

35:31.959 --> 35:34.250
and he could have been
a homosexual.

35:34.458 --> 35:35.999
Can you imagine, such
a thing to say, I mean,

35:36.166 --> 35:39.166
even to hear is too much!

35:39.583 --> 35:42.875
And we should make
some experiments,

35:43.041 --> 35:46.208
we should find out through
some discoveries.

35:46.417 --> 35:48.166
Can you imagine such
a hopeless thing

35:48.375 --> 35:50.959
he should say
in the church.

35:51.166 --> 35:54.250
So when the whole thing
– the ceremony he said it,

35:54.500 --> 36:02.166
then our Archbishop of Canterbury,
who is another one,

36:03.291 --> 36:09.041
was so enamoured by the
new discovery of this fellow

36:09.291 --> 36:13.041
that he honoured him
in a church in York.

36:13.250 --> 36:16.208
And then after the thing
the whole working

36:16.458 --> 36:20.333
was about to be over or
something they saw lightning

36:20.542 --> 36:24.000
looming round the church,
around it.

36:24.999 --> 36:26.959
When the all the people
were out

36:27.208 --> 36:30.583
this lightning completely
fell on that thing

36:30.834 --> 36:36.500
and destroyed the whole of the
church, except for the lower part.

36:38.041 --> 36:42.041
Now instead of seeing that
what they did was wrong,

36:42.333 --> 36:46.625
what they said that,
“See, look at the grace of God,

36:46.875 --> 36:54.667
and the grace of our faith that the lower
portion of the church was not burned.”

36:56.375 --> 36:58.625
Such an explanation
to be given!

36:58.834 --> 37:01.625
So then explanation come.
I’ve seen is very common here,

37:01.875 --> 37:05.583
because mind is very
intelligent here.

37:05.792 --> 37:11.083
“I did this because I thought
like this, I thought like that.”

37:11.333 --> 37:16.333
Always there is an explanation for
everything that you did wrong.

37:16.542 --> 37:18.875
“I thought like this.” But
why did you think like that

37:19.041 --> 37:22.375
is the point nobody
wants to hear.

37:22.583 --> 37:26.250
If you think, “Why did
I think like that?”

37:29.250 --> 37:35.041
So this is an escape from
the assertion of your ego

37:35.250 --> 37:39.834
that has harmed others
or also it has harmed

37:40.041 --> 37:42.625
some Gods. It’s just
an explanation,

37:42.834 --> 37:46.041
and people wriggle out.

37:46.250 --> 37:48.291
Actually there are
so many wrigglers

37:48.500 --> 37:51.166
I have seen like Mr Waldheim,
they just wriggle out of all these –

37:51.999 --> 37:57.166
all the problems
they have created,

37:57.417 --> 37:59.458
all the bad things they
have done, I mean,

37:59.667 --> 38:02.999
somehow or other they
know how to wriggle out.

38:03.667 --> 38:05.333
Because this method they
have developed

38:05.542 --> 38:09.291
is to just to say something
that would somehow

38:09.542 --> 38:15.875
or other give them a little
capacity to escape.

38:16.041 --> 38:19.500
But they don’t want
to face it.

38:21.083 --> 38:23.166
So now, we have
to understand

38:23.375 --> 38:26.125
that we must face it and
I know of Sahaja Yogis also,

38:26.333 --> 38:30.333
say there are certain, whom you tell them now:
“What? Why it has happened?”

38:30.583 --> 38:35.000
“I thought…”
But why did you think?

38:35.208 --> 38:37.709
You should have
seen the vibrations.

38:37.917 --> 38:39.750
You are not on
the thinking level,

38:39.959 --> 38:41.709
you are now on
the vibration level.

38:41.917 --> 38:43.959
Why not use your
vibratory awareness?

38:44.125 --> 38:47.709
“I thought.” Once this “I thought”
comes in your attention

38:49.125 --> 38:55.834
is on something that
is mythical.

38:56.041 --> 38:58.333
The reality is that you
have committed a mistake,

38:58.542 --> 39:01.959
all right admit it’s a mistake
and is to be corrected.

39:02.125 --> 39:08.875
Now take a car, now there’s
a car. If the car gets out of order

39:09.125 --> 39:13.041
or something, the car doesn’t
think, “I thought”, does it?

39:14.041 --> 39:17.959
And we also don’t think that
the car thought, never.

39:18.166 --> 39:21.500
What we do is to correct
the car, finished!

39:21.709 --> 39:24.083
If we have to drive the
car we correct the car.

39:24.291 --> 39:28.625
In the same way this mind
which says “I thought”

39:28.834 --> 39:32.959
should on the contrary
correct itself.

39:33.875 --> 39:36.166
So this sentence
of “I thought”

39:36.375 --> 39:40.834
should be out of the
language of Sahaja Yogis.

39:41.500 --> 39:45.458
So we don’t think, you know, we
are in thoughtless awareness.

39:46.208 --> 39:49.625
And then things work out,
properly.

39:49.999 --> 39:52.083
When you start
thinking that,

39:52.500 --> 39:58.166
“I think I am responsible,”
finished.

39:58.875 --> 40:02.291
When you start thinking,
“I am not responsible,

40:02.500 --> 40:07.417
it’s all done by God, I’m not
responsible for anything,”

40:08.542 --> 40:11.542
if some mistake is done
it’s God’s mistake,

40:11.792 --> 40:14.667
let Him have this
left Vishuddhi.

40:14.999 --> 40:17.667
But I haven’t done anything
wrong. But when I say

40:17.875 --> 40:20.875
“I thought” means
I take the responsibility

40:21.041 --> 40:24.417
and I create my own
problems.

40:26.041 --> 40:28.500
So to take a decision
you should be

40:28.709 --> 40:32.500
in that state of thoughtless
awareness.

40:32.750 --> 40:34.875
Many times I see all these
things happening

40:35.041 --> 40:37.917
like a drama around Me.
I keep quiet.

40:38.083 --> 40:41.999
I say, “All right, all right, everyone
all right.” I take the consensus.

40:42.208 --> 40:47.417
But whatever has to be done is
done according to God’s will.

40:49.125 --> 40:52.333
But it doesn’t amazes
people now,

40:52.583 --> 40:56.875
it used to once upon a time,
because it corrects people,

40:57.041 --> 41:00.999
it is fruitful, it achieves
results.

41:03.834 --> 41:05.834
Ultimately now they
have accepted

41:06.000 --> 41:08.083
that whatever Mother
decide is the best.

41:08.333 --> 41:10.417
But I don’t decide, actually,
to be very frank

41:10.667 --> 41:14.333
I don’t do anything. But I
see it so clearly,

41:14.542 --> 41:17.291
so evidently that this is the
right thing one should do,

41:17.542 --> 41:20.750
so why do wrong things?

41:21.291 --> 41:23.625
That’s how you have to
develop yourself,

41:23.834 --> 41:27.375
to get over this problem
of Vishuddhi.

41:27.583 --> 41:30.166
But Vishnumaya has
to be worshipped,

41:30.375 --> 41:32.583
has to be really remembered
every day,

41:32.834 --> 41:37.250
because that is a common
failing in the west.

41:37.834 --> 41:41.959
Now if your Vishnumaya is
bad, angry with you,

41:42.166 --> 41:49.041
then what happens? You go on
adding guilt after guilt,

41:50.458 --> 41:52.625
guilt after guilt, guilt after guilt.
But all the time if you are alert

41:52.834 --> 41:57.834
and keep your Vishnumaya
intact then what happens?

41:58.000 --> 42:06.333
That She looks after you, She doesn’t
allow any guilt to come in.

42:06.583 --> 42:12.667
And then the enjoyment of
your Spirit is maximum.

42:12.875 --> 42:17.875
With the guilt it’s a dent in it.
You see, you...

42:18.041 --> 42:21.208
“Ah, I am so happy Mother, happy,
very happy I am rejoicing,”

42:21.417 --> 42:25.709
but suddenly what happened?
“Oh, I did that wrong.”

42:25.959 --> 42:29.166
I have seen people getting
upset for small things, I mean,

42:29.375 --> 42:31.875
of course I have another life also,
a very sophisticated world.

42:32.041 --> 42:34.166
One gentleman was eating
all right, and suddenly, “Uh!”

42:34.542 --> 42:38.500
“What happened?”

42:38.792 --> 42:39.750
“Oh, I was supposed
to telephone

42:39.999 --> 42:44.417
to that person and I did
not telephone.”

42:44.625 --> 42:48.000
“But now you eat your food, now.
Why are you worried about that?”

42:48.250 --> 42:50.083
“No, I should have.”

42:50.291 --> 42:52.542
“But what is going to
happen in any case?

42:52.750 --> 42:55.208
You have not telephoned so
you have not telephoned now.

42:55.417 --> 42:58.667
It’s all right, now you better have
your food and telephone.”

42:58.875 --> 43:02.667
Then he finds out that the
man was not there at all,

43:02.917 --> 43:08.375
he could never have got him.
So all these things are, sort of,

43:08.583 --> 43:11.417
have created a kind of
a norms in our life

43:11.625 --> 43:13.875
and these are so
artificial norms.

43:14.041 --> 43:19.125
Now I was supposed to be
there, say at this time,

43:20.125 --> 43:24.959
I am not there, so what?
I should have been there,

43:25.125 --> 43:29.625
but if you are not there what’s
the use of feeling bad about it?

43:30.000 --> 43:32.917
I should have reached the place.
You’ll be surprised,

43:33.083 --> 43:35.208
the planes will wait,
the man will wait,

43:35.458 --> 43:41.417
everything will be there even
if you reach eight hours later.

43:42.208 --> 43:43.959
It would all happen
that way.

43:44.125 --> 43:48.041
But first you must get in tune
with this All-Pervading Power,

43:48.291 --> 43:52.999
with Vishnumaya. If you are
tuned with that,

43:53.166 --> 43:54.542
attuned with Her then
you will never find,

43:54.750 --> 43:59.250
it’s all in front of you.
It’s just there

43:59.458 --> 44:03.166
because remember now you have
entered into the Kingdom of God,

44:03.417 --> 44:07.542
just test it. But on the contrary
you are all the time

44:07.750 --> 44:13.041
using your human ignorance,
and then you get deceived.

44:13.250 --> 44:16.667
Try to know that you
are enlightened people,

44:16.875 --> 44:18.834
that you are not
any more ordinary.

44:19.041 --> 44:24.000
But unless and until you use
your powers what’s the use?

44:24.375 --> 44:28.999
It’s like some beggar - you
put him on the throne.

44:30.208 --> 44:33.458
And when people come to Me,
begs, whatever - all right.

44:33.792 --> 44:37.667
You are made the king,
why are you begging?

44:41.959 --> 44:46.625
So not to feel guilty
is our religion.

44:47.041 --> 44:49.999
Not to feel guilty.
We have to face it.

44:50.208 --> 44:51.792
If we have done
any mistake

44:51.999 --> 44:53.959
with open heart we should accept
we’ve done this mistake,

44:54.125 --> 44:57.417
go and tell the person,
do the thing or correct it,

44:57.625 --> 45:01.000
or attend to it, instead of
making a capital out of it

45:01.208 --> 45:04.333
and putting it down
on your Vishuddhi.

45:04.542 --> 45:08.583
It is a very big problem in the West
and I was surprised

45:08.917 --> 45:11.917
that it is very much on the increase
and they are very proud,

45:12.083 --> 45:16.709
“Oh, I’m so guilty!”
Better go to jail.

45:19.417 --> 45:24.583
All your pleasant temperament,
all your joyous temperament

45:24.792 --> 45:29.542
absolutely gets poisoned
by this guilt

45:29.792 --> 45:34.709
which has no meaning.
Neither it can help you

45:34.917 --> 45:40.667
nor can it help anyone. I’m telling
you with such earnestness,

45:40.875 --> 45:44.208
because I know it’s a, in the
beginning of course,

45:44.417 --> 45:47.291
all the Sahaja Yogis whom
I’ve met in the West

45:47.500 --> 45:52.083
had this guilt. Also Catholicism is
another one.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.333
In the Catholic Church you are
supposed to confess.

45:54.542 --> 45:58.417
But I have seen Protestants
very badly guilty.

45:59.250 --> 46:02.709
Protestants are no less.
But in India

46:02.917 --> 46:06.458
you take any Catholic or a Protestant
- nobody is guilty there.

46:07.291 --> 46:10.834
As I told you the other day a story
My granddaughter asked Me,

46:11.041 --> 46:13.999
“Grandma, what sins You
think I am committing?”

46:14.166 --> 46:17.208
I said, “What?” “I didn’t
commit any sin,

46:17.417 --> 46:19.917
but can You tell me if I am
committing any sin?”

46:20.083 --> 46:22.750
I said, “I don’t see
any sin in you.”

46:22.999 --> 46:25.917
She said, “But You know in
our school they asked me

46:26.083 --> 46:29.875
to confess my sins – so
what should I confess?”

46:30.291 --> 46:32.500
I said,
“What will you say?”

46:32.750 --> 46:34.750
“Oh, only thing
I ate two ice-creams.”

46:34.959 --> 46:37.999
So I said,
“Go and tell them.”

46:42.583 --> 46:44.959
So it’s so stupid
as that.

46:45.125 --> 46:48.291
If you see the point
it is very stupid

46:48.542 --> 46:51.250
and this stupidity you should,
Sahaja Yogis should not engulf.

46:51.458 --> 46:54.291
Keep yourself happy, makes
no difference whatsoever.

46:54.583 --> 46:57.166
And sometimes I make
mistakes, like suddenly,

46:57.417 --> 47:01.250
I don’t know why, Aristotle
I confused with Tolstoy.

47:01.458 --> 47:03.625
I don’t know why, Tolstoy
came into My mind,

47:03.875 --> 47:07.166
though I don’t think Tolstoy
was anywhere near Aristotle

47:07.375 --> 47:09.542
or Aristotle was
any near like that.

47:09.792 --> 47:12.417
But I did commit mistake
and I’ve been thinking,

47:12.625 --> 47:14.709
“Why, why it was so?”

47:17.208 --> 47:19.999
Still it is very important.

47:20.208 --> 47:25.500
Even these people, you see,
when they are described

47:25.750 --> 47:30.250
like - you see Aristotle had no
influence on Tolstoy at all,

47:30.542 --> 47:32.542
is a fact. He had
no influence.

47:32.792 --> 47:35.166
Aristotle was
a man with politics

47:35.375 --> 47:38.250
and all that and he displaced
all the philosophy on one side.

47:38.458 --> 47:41.250
Here is Tolstoy who
tried to show

47:41.458 --> 47:44.875
how a person can
resurrect.

47:45.542 --> 47:47.500
I don’t know if you
have read him or not,

47:47.709 --> 47:51.750
but I think he is one of the great
writers of those days.

47:51.959 --> 47:55.834
And the other day only I was
comparing both of them and I said,

47:56.000 --> 48:01.875
“Look at this man, he is absolutely
different from Aristotle,

48:02.083 --> 48:05.375
absolutely, two ends of
the thing we can say,

48:05.583 --> 48:09.125
and how is it that
he never read Aristotle?

48:11.166 --> 48:15.625
He was such a learned man,
he never read Aristotle.”

48:15.834 --> 48:20.208
Then I just felt it’s
a Russian mind,

48:20.625 --> 48:23.625
and Russian mind is
extremely introspective

48:23.834 --> 48:28.166
and this introspection
was missing in Mr Aristotle,

48:28.375 --> 48:32.250
was taking out everything out of
his head, the yarn, and putting people

48:32.458 --> 48:37.875
on the other line
altogether of this politics.

48:38.792 --> 48:40.583
Plato was even in
a way worse than him,

48:40.834 --> 48:45.291
but this one is another.
So Socrates was finished

48:46.041 --> 48:48.792
and Aristotle
became everything.

48:48.999 --> 48:54.834
But because I have been judging
both of them on their merits –

48:55.041 --> 48:56.583
then how is it Tolstoy?

48:56.834 --> 49:00.375
Because Tolstoy was
a born realised soul.

49:02.208 --> 49:05.875
So he saw life very
differently.

49:06.125 --> 49:08.999
If you have read Anna Karenina
there they have shown this lady,

49:09.166 --> 49:11.166
Anna Karenina, carrying
on with another man,

49:11.375 --> 49:14.500
when she was a married lady
and her husband very tolerant,

49:14.709 --> 49:16.583
working very hard
and all that

49:16.792 --> 49:18.500
and could not give her sufficient
time so she thought

49:18.750 --> 49:20.417
she has a right
to be romantic.

49:20.667 --> 49:25.834
And then at the end he proves
that she was never happy.

49:27.291 --> 49:32.166
But her husband was very
peaceful, very forgiving,

49:32.417 --> 49:35.542
but she was never happy and
ultimately she had to commit suicide.

49:35.750 --> 49:38.500
I mean these are
old writers,

49:38.709 --> 49:40.999
used to write like this - specially
those who were realised souls.

49:41.250 --> 49:44.417
But if you give the same
thing to somebody

49:44.625 --> 49:46.834
who is a modern writer
he would show

49:46.999 --> 49:49.875
that the husband committed
suicide, not the wife.

49:50.999 --> 49:53.750
And that’s what now we
are in the modern times

49:53.959 --> 50:00.500
and that’s how we are, that we
feel guilty for none of our faults.

50:00.709 --> 50:04.125
Here is a wife carrying
on with another man

50:04.375 --> 50:08.542
and the man feels that I am guilty
because I am not so attractive

50:08.750 --> 50:13.875
that’s why she’s carrying on with
another man and he commits suicide.

50:14.542 --> 50:20.208
It’s not so. It is the wife who
is wrong - not the man.

50:20.458 --> 50:24.250
So also there is a shift
of guilt or wrong

50:24.458 --> 50:29.583
from one to another by our
perverted thinking.

50:30.458 --> 50:32.792
I have seen some men who
are just like cabbages

50:32.999 --> 50:36.041
before their wives
- specially in America.

50:36.250 --> 50:40.375
Just cabbages! I said,
“Why are you such a cabbage?”

50:40.583 --> 50:42.750
So they say, “Mother,
You see it was our guilt –

50:42.959 --> 50:44.375
the way we suppressed
women.”

50:44.583 --> 50:48.875
“But why do you allow your women
to suppress you? That’s also wrong.”

50:49.834 --> 50:52.083
So they allow their
women to suppress them

50:52.291 --> 50:55.417
because they think their forefathers
suppressed the women.

50:55.625 --> 50:59.208
I mean, doing the same thing,
I mean, you are imbalancing yourself.

50:59.417 --> 51:03.041
Because you feel guilty.
For whom? For your forefathers.

51:03.250 --> 51:06.083
I mean they are dead
and gone - you are different.

51:06.291 --> 51:09.208
Like that we try to make
ourselves guilty,

51:09.417 --> 51:12.709
it’s a fashion, you know, like
dressing up in a funny way.

51:12.917 --> 51:15.959
All the time try to find
out what wrong

51:16.125 --> 51:19.999
we have done is
a typical Western mind.

51:21.291 --> 51:23.834
And then you become
Les Miserables.

51:23.999 --> 51:26.999
How can you be
happy people?

51:27.458 --> 51:30.959
All the time you start blaming
yourself, putting yourself down.

51:31.125 --> 51:35.041
All these theories and all those
things that have come to you

51:35.250 --> 51:38.083
have just made
you miserable people,

51:38.291 --> 51:42.208
without going to jail you
are in jail.

51:42.583 --> 51:45.083
Now this I was telling you
about the dresses.

51:45.291 --> 51:50.792
There’s a six inches
skirts have come.

51:50.999 --> 51:55.542
Now girls feel guilty if they don’t wear six inches.

51:56.834 --> 51:59.041
So actually it is
wrong to wear that –

51:59.250 --> 52:01.709
but they feel guilty that
they are not wearing.

52:01.917 --> 52:04.709
Because these are funny
norms we have created

52:04.959 --> 52:08.875
that whatever the entrepreneurs take
out we should be slaves to them.

52:09.041 --> 52:12.041
Immediately we should start
throwing away all our clothes,

52:12.250 --> 52:15.083
take new style, another style.
It is in Paris

52:15.291 --> 52:18.625
something comes up
everybody should wear.

52:19.041 --> 52:22.000
On the contrary if India
anybody starts such tricks,

52:22.208 --> 52:27.417
we’ll never accept. “Get lost!
We don’t want all this nonsense.”

52:29.125 --> 52:32.500
So by that we throw away
all the tradition

52:32.709 --> 52:35.750
which has grown us
to this level.

52:35.959 --> 52:39.333
All our traditions
we lose –

52:39.709 --> 52:42.208
because these entrepreneurs
are working on us,

52:42.417 --> 52:44.834
we are playing into their
hands and all these people

52:45.041 --> 52:46.917
are putting their yarns
every day,

52:47.166 --> 52:49.625
all kinds of theories
coming up from all over,

52:49.875 --> 52:54.500
we start accepting. If we do not
accept we feel guilty.

52:54.834 --> 52:59.417
It’s very surprising how
people accept nonsense.

52:59.959 --> 53:04.750
There’s a very painful
experience of Mine

53:04.999 --> 53:10.000
when I went to America
once and there was

53:10.375 --> 53:13.208
a little child of eight years
and she said, “He takes drugs,”

53:13.417 --> 53:15.917
the mother. I said, “Really?”
I felt so shocked

53:16.083 --> 53:18.583
I just took the child
to My Heart and I said,

53:18.834 --> 53:21.875
“Why do you take drugs?”
He looked up at Me.

53:22.041 --> 53:24.834
He said, “My mother never
hugs me like this.”

53:25.041 --> 53:27.959
I asked her, “Why don’t you
hug your child like that?”

53:28.125 --> 53:30.458
She said, “Because
I’ll develop a guilt.”

53:30.709 --> 53:31.959
I said, “How?”

53:32.125 --> 53:34.166
“According to Freud
it would be a guilt.”

53:34.417 --> 53:39.083
Now Freud is dictating that
it’s a guilt to hug your child,

53:39.333 --> 53:41.166
so you develop a guilt.

53:41.375 --> 53:43.834
So from where is it coming
this guilt to you?

53:44.000 --> 53:45.875
It’s from these books
that you are reading,

53:46.041 --> 53:48.250
these useless people
who are guiding you,

53:48.458 --> 53:50.917
they have no character,
they have no sense,

53:51.083 --> 53:52.583
they have no idea
of reality

53:52.834 --> 53:54.792
and that’s what
you accept as Bible,

53:55.000 --> 53:58.917
then naturally you will be
guilty.

54:00.417 --> 54:04.417
If a little coffee spills in a party,
“Oh My God!”

54:04.625 --> 54:07.667
then I think you are worse
than a criminal.

54:07.917 --> 54:10.667
Or if somebody’s carpet is
spoiled then of course,

54:10.917 --> 54:14.291
I mean, you should go
to jail immediately.

54:16.750 --> 54:21.166
More on very superficial things
these norms are made,

54:21.375 --> 54:25.583
on very superficial behaviours
these norms are made

54:25.792 --> 54:29.834
and then you start feeling
guilty. You don’t feel guilty

54:29.999 --> 54:32.709
that you are a racist,
you don’t feel guilty

54:32.917 --> 54:36.625
about the things about
which you have to feel guilty.

54:36.999 --> 54:40.125
That you aggress people
- in America killed thousands

54:40.333 --> 54:42.583
and thousands of people,
millions of people there,

54:42.792 --> 54:44.875
nobody feels guilty
about that.

54:45.041 --> 54:47.792
Or you dominated
the whole world –

54:47.999 --> 54:52.333
nobody feels guilty about that.
You feel guilty about things

54:52.583 --> 54:56.583
which are extremely
superficial.

54:57.291 --> 54:59.875
But for Sahaja Yogis,
they are so deep,

55:00.834 --> 55:06.375
so deep that if they have to feel
really bad about anything it is,

55:06.875 --> 55:11.500
I have to find out now what
they have to feel bad.

55:16.083 --> 55:20.250
I have found a simple
solution,if you feel bad

55:20.458 --> 55:23.667
please pull your ears,
finished!

55:23.875 --> 55:25.834
Or if you feel guilty
just pull your ears

55:26.000 --> 55:28.500
and the Vishuddhi will be all right.
It’s a very simple method

55:28.709 --> 55:31.458
just pull your ears like this,
finished! But sometimes

55:31.667 --> 55:33.500
I find people all the time

55:33.709 --> 55:37.125
walking before me like this,

55:38.333 --> 55:41.917
then I think what have
I done to them?

55:42.583 --> 55:46.834
Even while dancing
they’ll do the same.

55:49.041 --> 55:52.291
This is bit too much for Me to see
these people feeling,

55:52.500 --> 55:54.166
so I mean, in Sahaja Yoga

55:54.375 --> 55:56.500
is not such a hard and fast
rule about anything.

55:56.750 --> 55:59.041
I mean you are absolutely
free people

55:59.333 --> 56:02.333
and you have to use
all the freedom, absolutely.

56:02.583 --> 56:05.500
You are not to sort of be
guided by some hard

56:05.709 --> 56:09.834
and fast rule that all the time you
keep your ears pulled down like that.

56:10.000 --> 56:12.542
Just to overcome this nonsense
of your guilt I said,

56:12.750 --> 56:14.542
“All right you can
pull your ears.”

56:14.750 --> 56:18.250
And every time I see people
just pulling their ears.

56:18.500 --> 56:21.959
Yesterday a girl was
wearing a big earings

56:22.125 --> 56:23.500
and she was pulling her
earrings, you see,

56:23.709 --> 56:27.875
I was quite worried
it might…

56:30.166 --> 56:31.750
Sahaja Yoga is just a play,

56:31.959 --> 56:36.417
just an enjoyment it is not this
kind of hard and fast laws

56:36.625 --> 56:42.834
and regulations as you see. Because
you are now innately religious,

56:43.208 --> 56:45.542
you’ve got your Spirit
to see.

56:45.750 --> 56:48.458
What mistakes can
you commit?

56:48.667 --> 56:50.834
But where you have to be
careful you are not.

56:51.000 --> 56:54.750
For example, I say that
before going out

56:54.959 --> 56:58.125
please take a bandhan. It’s a kavach,
we call it a kavach.

56:58.375 --> 57:02.834
Means, kavach - in English there’s
a word for that?

57:06.709 --> 57:09.375
That’s rather, protection
is abstract,

57:09.583 --> 57:13.750
but this is a protection of the Mother
is a concrete stuff,

57:13.999 --> 57:16.583
you see, kavach. So you
take the kavach.

57:16.792 --> 57:20.083
Kavach is something you
can say that people

57:20.291 --> 57:26.542
wear those armour, inside, you see
that sort of a thing, is kavach.

57:26.792 --> 57:29.458
So you must take that
before going out

57:29.667 --> 57:33.041
or talking to somebody.
That you don’t do.

57:33.250 --> 57:35.041
Then I find there are,
I said,

57:35.291 --> 57:37.583
“From where are you coming?”
“Oh Mother,

57:37.834 --> 57:41.750
I went to see my,
I went to a cemetery.”

57:41.959 --> 57:44.458
I said, “For what?”
“Somebody died so I went there.”

57:44.667 --> 57:47.709
“So did you take your kavach?”
“No.”

57:47.999 --> 57:52.208
And you can see all the bhoots
dancing here on the head.

57:54.125 --> 57:55.959
This is the thing is that –

57:56.125 --> 57:59.709
and then you pull your
ears, what’s the use?

57:59.917 --> 58:04.208
It’s just a simple thing, take your
kavach when you are going out.

58:04.417 --> 58:06.500
It’s so simple, I mean,
in Sahaja Yoga

58:06.750 --> 58:09.667
we don’t have to do horrible
rituals that people do,

58:09.875 --> 58:13.333
nothing of the kind. Just take
your bandhan in the morning

58:13.542 --> 58:16.709
when you are going out and if
somebody is argumentative

58:16.917 --> 58:19.999
just give a bandhan.
Anything little bandhan

58:20.208 --> 58:22.792
can work out so many
things but we forget

58:22.999 --> 58:25.250
that we have entered into
the Kingdom of God

58:25.500 --> 58:30.333
and all the Saints and
all the angels

58:30.583 --> 58:33.875
and Ganas are at
your disposal.

58:34.667 --> 58:36.291
Now you have to believe
in yourself.

58:36.500 --> 58:40.375
How am I to tell you that
believe in yourself now?

58:40.583 --> 58:42.959
So this human nonsense
of feeling guilty

58:43.125 --> 58:46.709
should vanish from every
Sahaja Yogi.

58:46.917 --> 58:51.166
That’s why today we are
having this Vishnumaya.

58:52.166 --> 58:56.291
Now you see - for example the Vishnumaya
entered into this house,

58:56.542 --> 58:59.041
because it’s a new,
dilapidated, old house

58:59.291 --> 59:03.959
and it was a brewery. It was wrong
to have the Havan outside

59:04.125 --> 59:07.000
they should have had it inside.
Not to feel guilty about it,

59:07.250 --> 59:14.333
but again, I think they will also.
So, but this was wrong.

59:14.542 --> 59:16.875
So Vishnumaya saw that you
had committed a mistake

59:17.041 --> 59:20.125
She Herself came and
cleaned out everything.

59:20.375 --> 59:22.583
She didn’t think that you should
feel guilty, She thought,

59:22.792 --> 59:25.500
“These are children, still don’t know
anything about it,

59:25.709 --> 59:26.999
they don’t know how many
bhoots are inside.

59:27.208 --> 59:30.917
Better I go and do the job.”
And She cleansed it.

59:31.083 --> 59:33.834
That’s all, there’s nothing
to feel guilty about it.

59:34.000 --> 59:38.999
She knows better than you,
naturally, so She’s done the job.

59:39.250 --> 59:49.250
So - a Sahaja Yogi is not like a
- person

59:49.458 --> 59:53.750
who looks as if somebody
has died in his family.

59:53.999 --> 59:56.542
See like a very serious,
he can’t smile,

59:56.750 --> 59:58.999
even if you tickle he
won’t smile, you see,

59:59.250 --> 01:00:01.959
so much above everything, that sort
of a person he is not.

01:00:02.166 --> 01:00:06.583
He’s always bubbling with
enjoyment and love

01:00:06.792 --> 01:00:10.625
and understanding and friendship.
Everything he enjoys,

01:00:10.834 --> 01:00:18.125
that’s what he’s a Sahaja Yogi.
If you ever feel guilty,

01:00:18.375 --> 01:00:20.000
now of course better
pull your ears,

01:00:20.250 --> 01:00:23.750
that’s I would not cancel, because then
it might be much more there.

01:00:23.999 --> 01:00:25.417
But ever feel guilty
you said,

01:00:25.625 --> 01:00:27.625
“Why I’m feeling guilty?”
Just introspect.

01:00:27.834 --> 01:00:31.375
And this is the difference
between Aristotle and Tolstoy,

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.333
and yesterday
I just realised

01:00:33.542 --> 01:00:37.834
that why I thought of Tolstoy
instead of Aristotle.

01:00:38.375 --> 01:00:42.917
Now our Vishnumaya principle is
to be always kept very alert

01:00:43.083 --> 01:00:45.458
because it helps us in many ways.
First of all

01:00:45.709 --> 01:00:52.667
it helps us to pass the messages
from your heart to your head.

01:00:52.959 --> 01:00:56.834
It is the one by which we
integrate. Our heart and head

01:00:56.999 --> 01:01:01.208
is integrated by the
Vishnumaya principle

01:01:01.417 --> 01:01:08.333
more than the Vishuddhi
on the right side.

01:01:08.583 --> 01:01:12.959
Vishuddhi on the right side
can create collectivity,

01:01:13.125 --> 01:01:15.375
can create understanding
with each other

01:01:15.625 --> 01:01:20.834
but on the left side it helps you
to keep a complete integration

01:01:21.792 --> 01:01:26.667
between your heart
and your head.

01:01:28.417 --> 01:01:32.125
If there is a guilt you just
think of it and analyse it.

01:01:32.333 --> 01:01:38.250
It means that there’s a struggle between
you in your heart and your mind,

01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:41.458
isn’t it? Simple as that.

01:01:41.667 --> 01:01:46.542
If it was integrated you
would not feel guilty.

01:01:48.041 --> 01:01:51.375
And that is why all these artificial
theories that have come,

01:01:51.583 --> 01:01:54.875
all these artificial yarns
that you have read

01:01:55.041 --> 01:02:00.792
and all that, you forget it.
You are a Sahaja Yogi

01:02:00.999 --> 01:02:06.500
and you have entered into
the Kingdom of God - enjoy!

01:02:06.875 --> 01:02:09.875
That’s all you have to do.
But you have to get

01:02:10.041 --> 01:02:12.750
to that state of enjoyment
and understanding

01:02:12.959 --> 01:02:15.999
that you are above all.
Even you can’t say

01:02:16.208 --> 01:02:20.417
that you should not be like
Buddha who’s sitting silently.

01:02:20.625 --> 01:02:23.834
Nothing of the kind.
Buddha was sitting silently

01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:25.999
only when he was
doing meditation.

01:02:26.166 --> 01:02:29.625
Otherwise you have seen the
fat Buddha with all the children

01:02:29.834 --> 01:02:31.999
and laughing Buddha.

01:02:32.208 --> 01:02:36.041
That means Ego must
laugh at itself.

01:02:36.250 --> 01:02:39.999
That’s how this filth of this
guilt won’t be there.

01:02:40.208 --> 01:02:42.999
Just laugh at yourself.
How I did like this.

01:02:43.166 --> 01:02:46.834
Laughing at yourself is a very good
way of understanding yourself.

01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:52.625
Try to find out what nonsense
I do. How I behave.

01:02:52.834 --> 01:02:57.917
Like there’s a lady, she always feels
responsible for everything, know?

01:02:58.083 --> 01:03:00.250
I call her Ghivdhari,
means the one

01:03:00.458 --> 01:03:05.792
who held the mountain
Govardhan in his hand.like that.

01:03:05.999 --> 01:03:07.917
She thinks she’s responsible
for everything.

01:03:08.083 --> 01:03:11.750
And I try to outwit her in
all her responsibilities,

01:03:11.959 --> 01:03:14.667
just to make her understand that
she’s not responsible.

01:03:14.875 --> 01:03:17.917
And when she feels
she’s responsible

01:03:18.083 --> 01:03:22.417
she’s all the time accumulating
this guilt in her.

01:03:22.625 --> 01:03:25.333
Because firstly she’s
not responsible

01:03:25.542 --> 01:03:31.125
and secondly being
responsible she’s definitely

01:03:31.667 --> 01:03:34.458
going to commit some
sort of mistakes and then

01:03:34.667 --> 01:03:39.333
she’s going to take the
responsibility of the mistakes

01:03:39.583 --> 01:03:41.709
and feel guilty. Then Vishnumaya
gets angry

01:03:41.917 --> 01:03:46.792
and if She gets angry then you’ll
have problem of the left side.

01:03:47.667 --> 01:03:53.834
And left side is so important
that it doesn’t show,

01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000
it doesn’t express itself
but it is painful to you.

01:03:57.250 --> 01:04:02.083
Left side is your own,
it is painful to you,

01:04:02.291 --> 01:04:04.667
is troublesome to you. If there
is ego others are troubled

01:04:04.875 --> 01:04:07.625
but if there is left
side you feel bad.

01:04:07.875 --> 01:04:10.083
So don’t feel bad for
anything, I mean,

01:04:10.250 --> 01:04:12.583
some people feel bad because
they were late for Puja,

01:04:12.792 --> 01:04:14.875
doesn’t matter. That’s the time
you had to come.

01:04:15.041 --> 01:04:17.999
Some people feel that they couldn’t
bring something for Puja,

01:04:18.166 --> 01:04:20.917
doesn’t matter. I never say,
“You didn’t bring this,

01:04:21.083 --> 01:04:24.999
you didn’t do that.” I have never
said anything about the Puja,

01:04:25.208 --> 01:04:27.917
never - even once. That you
did this wrong,

01:04:28.083 --> 01:04:30.792
or you should not have
done this wrong,

01:04:30.999 --> 01:04:33.125
should have got it. Gradually
you all have learned.

01:04:33.333 --> 01:04:34.792
What was the need
to tell you

01:04:34.999 --> 01:04:37.583
otherwise there would have
been another big well

01:04:37.792 --> 01:04:40.667
of this guilt in your heads.
So you have to learn,

01:04:40.834 --> 01:04:43.125
you have never known pujas
before, you don’t know

01:04:43.333 --> 01:04:45.959
what puja means, you don’t know
anything of that kind,

01:04:46.125 --> 01:04:51.333
how it helps you. So, whatever
was done, you are growing,

01:04:51.583 --> 01:04:54.333
after all children when they are
growing they’ll do mistakes.

01:04:54.542 --> 01:04:58.999
Only My job is to protect you
and that I am doing.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:03.375
But now don’t try to destroy
yourself by feeling guilty.

01:05:03.583 --> 01:05:07.125
That’s why we are today doing
the Puja of Vishnumaya.

01:05:07.375 --> 01:05:11.792
She is Kali who is
the sister of Shri Krishna

01:05:11.999 --> 01:05:16.291
and who was Draupadi.
Who is the one

01:05:16.583 --> 01:05:21.208
who is all the time for our
protection and for telling us

01:05:21.417 --> 01:05:23.959
that we should not
feel guilty at all

01:05:24.166 --> 01:05:26.917
and enjoy life.

01:05:28.041 --> 01:05:30.667
May God Bless you!
