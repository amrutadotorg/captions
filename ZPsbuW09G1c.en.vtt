00:00:08.127 --> 00:00:19.021
Now the question is about 
how we deal with each other in Sahaja Yoga,

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:26.919
how we live with each other, how we talk to each other.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.110
What is the net result?

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:42.250
Do we have a complete rapport with other Sahaja Yogis in the same city?

00:00:46.902 --> 00:00:55.306
Do you invite them to your house as you would invite your neighbors?

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:10.337
In any matter whatsoever pertaining to you,

00:01:10.457 --> 00:01:20.688
any matter whatsoever, the relations have nothing to do with you.

00:01:22.783 --> 00:01:29.346
That’s how you will start getting detached and not worrying about it.

00:01:40.705 --> 00:01:45.250
Now here are the many Western Sahaja Yogis.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:02:03.100
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS IN HINDI].

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:28.862
The description I’ve given now of
when people who are left-sided actually,

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:32.057
they have attachments of the left side.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.610
The right side attachments are different type, as you know very well.

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:46.000
The first one is that they are individualistic, they don’t like collectivity.

00:02:47.936 --> 00:03:01.947
They think it is a force on them; it is a binding thing, so that they cannot rise.

00:03:03.918 --> 00:03:09.852
Right-sided people have the biggest problem is of ego,

00:03:09.932 --> 00:03:15.535
which is all the time sitting like a snake, coiled up.

00:03:15.616 --> 00:03:24.444
Something goes wrong, suddenly it comes up – Ha! 
and you see a snake come up now.

00:03:24.555 --> 00:03:28.452
The snake is very springy.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:45.000
But now with Sahaja Yoga it is getting intoxicated, 
I think; it doesn’t come up.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.445
So the attachments: on what points do we get upset?

00:03:49.526 --> 00:03:52.634
We should write it down.
All right.

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:57.949
For example, what do I get upset with, Myself?

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.499
When I see a Sahaja Yogi becoming bhootish I get upset.

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:10.312
But you just try to find out: “When do I get upset?”

00:04:10.392 --> 00:04:15.191
and you’ll be surprised, most of
those things are out of Sahaja Yoga;

00:04:15.271 --> 00:04:17.950
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.160
But you are very upset, very angry, 
and you don’t want to talk about it.

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:32.732
So this attitude of mind has to be changed.

00:04:32.813 --> 00:04:38.954
When you are set now in Sahaja Yoga, how can you be upset?

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.150
That means you are not set: simple thing.

00:04:45.231 --> 00:04:48.774
You are now set in Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.509
So how can you be upset?

00:04:53.429 --> 00:05:02.056
A very common language there is to say: “I hope you are not upset”.

00:05:02.137 --> 00:05:09.670
When you say somebody is upset, he’s upset, I
mean, may be whether you hope or don’t hope!

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.670
But we do not also consider how do we upset others?

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:22.760
We don’t also find out the ways and methods, how not to upset others.

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:34.782
And even the humor we have, if it is
pinching humor, if it is disturbing humor,

00:05:34.862 --> 00:05:46.333
if it is denouncing humor, that can upset a person very much.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:58.276
So what sort of language we speak, 
what sort of communication we have, what sort of

00:06:00.815 --> 00:06:09.785
harm we do to people: you need not be hot-tempered,

00:06:09.865 --> 00:06:13.500
your ego may not be seen, but it’s the style,

00:06:13.581 --> 00:06:20.231
very sly style of the ego, just to say something horrible.

00:06:21.961 --> 00:06:26.413
Second way is of criticizing others all the time:

00:06:26.493 --> 00:06:30.810
“This is not good, that is not good, this not good."

00:06:31.222 --> 00:06:35.563
Who has asked you to judge it?

00:06:35.651 --> 00:06:38.198
So you should not judge yourself,

00:06:38.278 --> 00:06:44.090
at the same time you should not judge others and punish them.

00:06:48.043 --> 00:06:57.914
In our day to day life we have to develop
 a very sweet language, extremely sweet.

00:06:58.993 --> 00:07:06.532
We have to work it out, actually work it
out, because even coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:07:06.612 --> 00:07:11.794
still it lingers, certain things,

00:07:13.644 --> 00:07:20.817
and these habits can be corrected very simply, very easily.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:31.316
It belongs to the tongue, not to us,
 so it’s very easy to get rid of them.
