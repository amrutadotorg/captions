00:08.127 --> 00:19.021
Now the question is about
how we deal with each other in Sahaja Yoga,

00:19.142 --> 00:26.919
how we live with each other, how we talk to each other.

00:27.040 --> 00:29.110
What is the net result?

00:31.633 --> 00:42.250
Do we have a complete rapport with other Sahaja Yogis in the same city?

00:46.902 --> 00:55.306
Do you invite them to your house as you would invite your neighbors?

01:01.380 --> 01:10.337
In any matter whatsoever pertaining to you,

01:10.457 --> 01:20.688
any matter whatsoever, the relations have nothing to do with you.

01:22.783 --> 01:29.346
That’s how you will start getting detached and not worrying about it.

01:40.705 --> 01:45.250
Now here are the many Western Sahaja Yogis.

01:45.530 --> 02:03.100
[SHRI MATAJI SPEAKS IN HINDI].

02:19.360 --> 02:28.862
The description I’ve given now of
when people who are left-sided actually,

02:28.982 --> 02:32.057
they have attachments of the left side.

02:32.230 --> 02:36.610
The right side attachments are different type, as you know very well.

02:36.690 --> 02:46.000
The first one is that they are individualistic, they don’t like collectivity.

02:47.936 --> 03:01.947
They think it is a force on them; it is a binding thing, so that they cannot rise.

03:03.918 --> 03:09.852
Right-sided people have the biggest problem is of ego,

03:09.932 --> 03:15.535
which is all the time sitting like a snake, coiled up.

03:15.616 --> 03:24.444
Something goes wrong, suddenly it comes up – Ha!
and you see a snake come up now.

03:24.555 --> 03:28.452
The snake is very springy.

03:33.780 --> 03:45.000
But now with Sahaja Yoga it is getting intoxicated,
I think; it doesn’t come up.

03:45.080 --> 03:49.445
So the attachments: on what points do we get upset?

03:49.526 --> 03:52.634
We should write it down.
All right.

03:52.715 --> 03:57.949
For example, what do I get upset with, Myself?

03:58.030 --> 04:05.499
When I see a Sahaja Yogi becoming bhootish I get upset.

04:05.799 --> 04:10.312
But you just try to find out: “When do I get upset?”

04:10.392 --> 04:15.191
and you’ll be surprised, most of
those things are out of Sahaja Yoga;

04:15.271 --> 04:17.950
they have nothing to do with Sahaja Yoga.

04:18.030 --> 04:24.160
But you are very upset, very angry,
and you don’t want to talk about it.

04:26.940 --> 04:32.732
So this attitude of mind has to be changed.

04:32.813 --> 04:38.954
When you are set now in Sahaja Yoga, how can you be upset?

04:39.440 --> 04:45.150
That means you are not set: simple thing.

04:45.231 --> 04:48.774
You are now set in Sahaja Yoga.

04:48.855 --> 04:51.509
So how can you be upset?

04:53.429 --> 05:02.056
A very common language there is to say: “I hope you are not upset”.

05:02.137 --> 05:09.670
When you say somebody is upset, he’s upset, I
mean, may be whether you hope or don’t hope!

05:09.750 --> 05:15.670
But we do not also consider how do we upset others?

05:15.750 --> 05:22.760
We don’t also find out the ways and methods, how not to upset others.

05:25.529 --> 05:34.782
And even the humor we have, if it is
pinching humor, if it is disturbing humor,

05:34.862 --> 05:46.333
if it is denouncing humor, that can upset a person very much.

05:49.600 --> 05:58.276
So what sort of language we speak,
what sort of communication we have, what sort of

06:00.815 --> 06:09.785
harm we do to people: you need not be hot-tempered,

06:09.865 --> 06:13.500
your ego may not be seen, but it’s the style,

06:13.581 --> 06:20.231
very sly style of the ego, just to say something horrible.

06:21.961 --> 06:26.413
Second way is of criticizing others all the time:

06:26.493 --> 06:30.810
“This is not good, that is not good, this not good."

06:31.222 --> 06:35.563
Who has asked you to judge it?

06:35.651 --> 06:38.198
So you should not judge yourself,

06:38.278 --> 06:44.090
at the same time you should not judge others and punish them.

06:48.043 --> 06:57.914
In our day to day life we have to develop
a very sweet language, extremely sweet.

06:58.993 --> 07:06.532
We have to work it out, actually work it
out, because even coming to Sahaja Yoga

07:06.612 --> 07:11.794
still it lingers, certain things,

07:13.644 --> 07:20.817
and these habits can be corrected very simply, very easily.

07:22.150 --> 07:31.316
It belongs to the tongue, not to us,
so it’s very easy to get rid of them.
