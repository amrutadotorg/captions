00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:10.085
I am so very filled with joy

00:00:11.529 --> 00:00:19.821
and My heart is so full of gratitude for

00:00:20.408 --> 00:00:25.535
all the Sahaja Yogis who have been able

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:29.714
to create this beautiful place.

00:00:31.391 --> 00:00:39.068
I cannot imagine how much they must have worked hard

00:00:39.452 --> 00:00:48.242
in such a place to create such  a beautiful

00:00:51.112 --> 00:00:56.228
area, such a blissful place.

00:01:05.347 --> 00:01:11.896
How in Sahaja Yoga people work together

00:01:13.557 --> 00:01:18.086
with tremendous respect and love for each other,

00:01:18.817 --> 00:01:24.275
and produce something that is unbelievable.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.833
This was just a wilderness,

00:01:30.508 --> 00:01:35.186
and you have brought so much of

00:01:35.646 --> 00:01:39.693
life and light in this place.

00:01:46.598 --> 00:01:52.201
You wanted to celebrate My birthday.

00:01:54.491 --> 00:01:59.629
I don't know what is such a significant about it.

00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:08.098
But the way you have really shown

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:12.979
your understanding and respect, I am just enamored.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.008
I can't understand what have I done for you,

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.328
that you should do so much for Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:26.692 --> 00:02:31.946
As it is, today is also a very auspicious day

00:02:32.147 --> 00:02:36.024
which we call as the Holi.

00:02:36.225 --> 00:02:39.030
They play Holi on this day

00:02:39.218 --> 00:02:46.765
and show their love and oneness among themselves.

00:02:46.966 --> 00:02:52.977
This is the time when we have to really understand

00:02:53.178 --> 00:02:56.233
the value of love,

00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:01.892
of respect of others,

00:03:02.093 --> 00:03:05.886
because so far we have based

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:11.337
all our theories and all our ideas

00:03:11.538 --> 00:03:17.373
on the principle that human beings cannot love each other.

00:03:18.107 --> 00:03:22.465
They are always trying to overpower others

00:03:22.666 --> 00:03:24.457
or to hate others,

00:03:24.645 --> 00:03:27.735
or to grab things from others.

00:03:27.936 --> 00:03:31.755
Such a wrong idea we had all these days,

00:03:31.998 --> 00:03:36.030
and that's why all the organizations that were created

00:03:36.187 --> 00:03:37.790
to obstruct it

00:03:37.991 --> 00:03:41.622
also got contaminated with it.

00:03:44.691 --> 00:03:52.290
The only way one can really understand what we are

00:03:52.491 --> 00:03:55.386
is by knowing yourself.

00:03:56.044 --> 00:03:58.989
When you know yourself you are surprised

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.797
that what is the greatest thing for you

00:04:02.998 --> 00:04:06.178
is to love and to be loved.

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:10.404
You enjoy that collective love so much

00:04:10.605 --> 00:04:16.848
when you are absolutely overcome

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:20.830
your baser self.

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.884
In Sahaja Yoga it is so simple.

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:26.481
It works in a very simple manner.

00:04:26.682 --> 00:04:28.668
It's very Sahaja!

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:35.161
But to grow into it is very important,

00:04:35.362 --> 00:04:38.983
and I am so very happy to see so many of you

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:41.090
from all over the world,

00:04:41.294 --> 00:04:45.405
from Delhi and also from all over India,

00:04:45.606 --> 00:04:48.554
enjoying that love among yourselves

00:04:48.755 --> 00:04:52.772
and understanding among yourselves.

00:04:54.472 --> 00:04:57.960
I never expected that in My lifetime

00:04:58.161 --> 00:05:03.257
I'll be able to see all this beautiful world of love,

00:05:03.458 --> 00:05:05.752
trust and peace.

00:05:05.953 --> 00:05:08.787
But today really I must say,

00:05:08.988 --> 00:05:14.512
it shows what we are capable of doing.

00:05:15.252 --> 00:05:21.715
We human beings, so-called, are very selfish,

00:05:21.916 --> 00:05:23.637
self-centered

00:05:23.838 --> 00:05:27.523
and only worried about ourselves.

00:05:27.724 --> 00:05:29.570
That is what is said!

00:05:29.771 --> 00:05:35.044
but it's surprising that with Self-Realization,

00:05:35.245 --> 00:05:39.293
with self-knowledge, with knowing yourself,

00:05:39.494 --> 00:05:42.679
you understand how rich you are within,

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.754
how great you are within

00:05:44.955 --> 00:05:47.772
and how capable you are.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.626
This understanding comes to you,

00:05:50.827 --> 00:05:56.275
and then that is expressed in such a beautiful manner.

00:05:57.205 --> 00:06:02.924
Sahaja Yoga took time to grow, slowly and slowly,

00:06:03.125 --> 00:06:10.291
and that you all have slowly and slowly grown also.

00:06:10.492 --> 00:06:16.295
But today I must say that it has reached such a height

00:06:16.496 --> 00:06:22.418
that it's difficult for people to get out of it.

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:25.012
When you know yourself,

00:06:25.216 --> 00:06:27.626
when you know what is reality

00:06:27.827 --> 00:06:30.232
and what is absolute truth,

00:06:30.433 --> 00:06:34.877
you just get dissolved into that knowledge.

00:06:35.078 --> 00:06:42.851
Of course you are not knowledgeable in the way people are;

00:06:43.052 --> 00:06:47.167
you are knowledgeable in the real sense of the word,

00:06:47.368 --> 00:06:54.433
because you realize what is within you is a big power of love.

00:06:54.624 --> 00:06:57.365
There's a big power of understanding.

00:06:57.561 --> 00:06:59.784
(Can you bring Me some water?) - Hindi

00:06:59.985 --> 00:07:01.316
All right.

00:07:01.517 --> 00:07:04.746
There's a big power of understanding,

00:07:04.947 --> 00:07:09.295
a big power of oneness, of collective.

00:07:09.496 --> 00:07:12.787
This collectivity works wonders

00:07:12.988 --> 00:07:17.128
and gives such joy that we are all one,

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:22.553
we have no enemies, we have no problems.

00:07:22.754 --> 00:07:26.626
We are all one together.

00:07:30.648 --> 00:07:34.171
It goes on faling this.

00:07:36.213 --> 00:07:38.068
It's better.

00:07:38.269 --> 00:07:42.112
Yes, that's the way it should... It's too high.

00:07:42.782 --> 00:07:44.946
It's all right.

00:07:55.763 --> 00:08:01.905
This joy that was expressed by you

00:08:03.237 --> 00:08:10.692
is like the waves that go to the shores,

00:08:10.893 --> 00:08:15.707
touch the shores and come back, creating beautiful patterns.

00:08:15.908 --> 00:08:18.607
And I see that happening now,

00:08:18.808 --> 00:08:24.368
that these beautiful patterns are showing in your own life,

00:08:24.591 --> 00:08:27.751
in your lifestyle, in your behavior.

00:08:27.932 --> 00:08:34.377
There is a very special type of human race is sitting before Me.

00:08:34.578 --> 00:08:44.583
I am so much thankful to you, absolutely,

00:08:44.784 --> 00:08:53.688
that you should take to this simple knowledge of yourself

00:08:54.102 --> 00:08:56.934
and enjoy it with others.

00:08:57.135 --> 00:09:03.484
It's something remarkable that you know about yourself,

00:09:03.685 --> 00:09:06.574
that's only human beings can do.

00:09:06.775 --> 00:09:09.981
There can be a diamond, very expensive,

00:09:10.182 --> 00:09:12.486
but it doesn't know its value.

00:09:12.669 --> 00:09:17.138
There could be some dog or some animal

00:09:17.347 --> 00:09:20.500
which must be something par excellence,

00:09:20.691 --> 00:09:23.509
but he doesn't know what he is.

00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.583
Same thing happens with the human beings

00:09:27.784 --> 00:09:30.362
till they get their Self-Realization.

00:09:30.563 --> 00:09:32.581
And after Realization,

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:37.846
they suddenly become aware of what they are.

00:09:38.655 --> 00:09:42.524
And then suddenly they become very humble,

00:09:42.725 --> 00:09:44.690
they become very loving.

00:09:44.891 --> 00:09:48.398
Now supposing if somebody knows that he is a king,

00:09:48.597 --> 00:09:54.117
or he discovers that he is a some great musician

00:09:54.318 --> 00:09:57.152
or a prime minister or something.

00:09:57.353 --> 00:10:00.737
He feels very aloof

00:10:00.938 --> 00:10:04.978
and he thinks no end of himself.

00:10:05.179 --> 00:10:08.258
But by this knowledge that you have,

00:10:08.433 --> 00:10:13.618
you become one with the rest of Sahaja Yogis and enjoy it.

00:10:13.851 --> 00:10:17.716
It's very remarkable how it works out

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:21.348
that you enjoy each other so much.

00:10:21.549 --> 00:10:26.235
And to do something for this collective work,

00:10:26.426 --> 00:10:30.373
you can dedicate yourself to it.

00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:37.379
Now My experience of seventy-seven years, as you can say,

00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:41.819
has been really checkered with all kinds of incidents,

00:10:42.020 --> 00:10:47.071
all kinds of people, all kinds of incidents.

00:10:47.272 --> 00:10:53.986
And it's a good vision to see before your eyes

00:10:54.187 --> 00:10:59.949
that despite all that, so many beautiful lotuses have come out,

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.365
and they are so fragrant, so beautiful,

00:11:05.566 --> 00:11:09.090
so colorful, so attractive.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:17.688
All this is because we have an innate value system,

00:11:19.032 --> 00:11:22.916
because we have inborn within us

00:11:23.117 --> 00:11:30.755
a great sense of love and compassion.

00:11:31.180 --> 00:11:39.710
This compassion has to be really understood and enjoyed,

00:11:39.911 --> 00:11:44.037
and jump in the ocean of compassion.

00:11:44.238 --> 00:11:47.972
So beautiful, and you'll be amazed to see

00:11:48.173 --> 00:11:51.212
that automatically you'll swim,

00:11:51.413 --> 00:11:56.475
automatically you'll meet other people also in the same ocean,

00:11:56.676 --> 00:12:00.488
and without any problems, without any troubles,

00:12:00.663 --> 00:12:04.364
all enjoying the bliss of this love,

00:12:04.565 --> 00:12:07.987
this compassion, this Divine love.

00:12:10.547 --> 00:12:14.608
I must really congratulate

00:12:14.854 --> 00:12:20.575
the Delhi people for coming up so well

00:12:21.027 --> 00:12:24.607
with this beautiful arrangement

00:12:24.819 --> 00:12:27.298
and this beautiful pendal,

00:12:27.499 --> 00:12:31.322
and all the beautiful arrangements they have made outside

00:12:31.523 --> 00:12:33.053
for your stay.

00:12:33.254 --> 00:12:36.311
I mean really it's something,

00:12:36.512 --> 00:12:41.434
I have done nothing for it, nothing, I should say.

00:12:41.635 --> 00:12:44.913
How these people have worked together:

00:12:45.147 --> 00:12:48.268
there have been no quarrels, fighting,

00:12:48.469 --> 00:12:50.843
backbiting, nothing of the kind.

00:12:51.044 --> 00:12:52.665
It's very surprising

00:12:52.866 --> 00:12:56.604
that such a beautiful thing has been created by them;

00:12:56.805 --> 00:13:01.370
shows their maturity in Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:01.571 --> 00:13:04.553
I must congratulate them again and again

00:13:04.754 --> 00:13:07.595
for doing this great work

00:13:07.796 --> 00:13:11.003
in such a short time.

00:13:11.204 --> 00:13:13.360
First I talked in English

00:13:13.561 --> 00:13:16.585
because many people have come here from foreign countries.

00:13:16.786 --> 00:13:18.863
And you don't have any objection

00:13:19.064 --> 00:13:21.833
that we talk in English for a little while.

00:13:22.034 --> 00:13:26.574
This is an amazing feat by people of Delhi,

00:13:26.765 --> 00:13:33.018
to whom people of Uttar Pradesh joined,

00:13:33.275 --> 00:13:36.328
people from Rajasthan also joined,

00:13:36.539 --> 00:13:39.926
and people from Haryana also helped -

00:13:40.127 --> 00:13:43.155
and together they made with love

00:13:43.356 --> 00:13:47.637
this very beautiful pandal like a temple.

00:13:47.838 --> 00:13:53.216
I, Myself, was surprised seeing it

00:13:53.910 --> 00:13:57.350
that there are such talented artists here.

00:13:57.551 --> 00:13:59.384
I didn't know.

00:13:59.585 --> 00:14:02.124
Where did this art come from?

00:14:02.325 --> 00:14:08.110
I can't understand how they made and decorated all this.

00:14:08.311 --> 00:14:14.636
I didn't know that there are such talented artists in our country

00:14:14.837 --> 00:14:17.256
and that too, talent of love.

00:14:17.457 --> 00:14:22.056
The power of love, the art of love

00:14:22.257 --> 00:14:25.407
and the art of loving everybody,

00:14:25.608 --> 00:14:30.850
whosoever gets it, only he can do such an artistic composition.

00:14:31.051 --> 00:14:33.362
One should learn this art

00:14:33.563 --> 00:14:41.389
that how with the help of our speech, heart and mind

00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:46.150
we can become artists, artists of love

00:14:46.351 --> 00:14:51.498
and how we can make others happy by our words,

00:14:51.699 --> 00:14:53.446
and spread joy among them.

00:14:53.647 --> 00:14:58.354
What kind of loving things can we say?

00:14:58.555 --> 00:15:00.785
This is the aspect of speech.

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:05.268
Then with our mind we can think,

00:15:05.469 --> 00:15:10.194
how we can shower our love among people,

00:15:10.395 --> 00:15:17.015
how we can open our heart in front of others

00:15:17.216 --> 00:15:21.488
and establish them in our heart.

00:15:22.424 --> 00:15:25.717
And for heart aspect,

00:15:25.918 --> 00:15:28.266
if a person doesn't have love in his heart

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:32.206
he does not deserve anything in the world;

00:15:32.407 --> 00:15:34.906
because whatever he gets,

00:15:35.107 --> 00:15:39.254
he cannot be satisfied in any way,

00:15:39.455 --> 00:15:41.546
he cannot be content.

00:15:41.747 --> 00:15:47.594
But when there is an ocean of contentment within you

00:15:47.806 --> 00:15:52.729
then is there anything that cannot satisfy you?

00:15:52.946 --> 00:15:56.520
When it happens within you

00:15:56.708 --> 00:15:59.794
and the peace of contentment establishes within you,

00:15:59.995 --> 00:16:06.129
then, nobody can understand the boundaries of that contentment,

00:16:06.330 --> 00:16:10.927
then nobody can understand this business of contenment.

00:16:11.128 --> 00:16:16.487
All that happens in so sweet and beautiful

00:16:16.688 --> 00:16:19.111
that it is a real spectacle.

00:16:19.312 --> 00:16:24.498
One can't understand what he is doing and what others are doing,

00:16:24.699 --> 00:16:27.526
what they are saying and what he is saying,

00:16:27.727 --> 00:16:33.137
and how are they covering him with their love,

00:16:33.162 --> 00:16:40.915
and how shall he shower his love on them.

00:16:41.116 --> 00:16:43.624
Day and night all he worries about is

00:16:43.791 --> 00:16:47.010
that: "Today, whom I have to meet

00:16:47.211 --> 00:16:50.421
and what loving things should I tell them,

00:16:50.622 --> 00:16:54.086
what can I tell them for their benevolence".

00:16:54.287 --> 00:16:58.832
Because the practice of talking about useless things

00:16:59.033 --> 00:17:00.880
leads only to loss.

00:17:01.081 --> 00:17:02.786
It has never been beneficial

00:17:02.987 --> 00:17:08.521
and afterwards the anger that comes in a human being

00:17:08.722 --> 00:17:11.578
leads to even more harm.

00:17:11.779 --> 00:17:16.708
Then there is no need to teach one not to be violent,

00:17:16.909 --> 00:17:21.176
not to treat anyone badly,

00:17:21.377 --> 00:17:23.342
not to destroy anyone,

00:17:23.543 --> 00:17:25.303
and not to cheat anybody for money.

00:17:25.504 --> 00:17:27.417
There is no need to teach all this.

00:17:27.618 --> 00:17:31.364
You became so beautiful on your own.

00:17:31.565 --> 00:17:35.133
I said that you have become lotuses yourselves,

00:17:35.334 --> 00:17:38.888
that you only know to spread your fragrance

00:17:39.089 --> 00:17:40.700
and nothing else.

00:17:40.901 --> 00:17:44.542
And the joy of giving to others -

00:17:44.743 --> 00:17:50.040
to feel that joy is an unique experience.

00:17:50.256 --> 00:17:54.948
Only people with a novel personality can do it.

00:17:55.149 --> 00:17:59.046
Now you are the masters of it

00:17:59.247 --> 00:18:05.047
and the heritage that you had,

00:18:05.248 --> 00:18:08.104
you have utilized it fully.

00:18:08.305 --> 00:18:10.406
Now that thing is open to everyone,

00:18:10.607 --> 00:18:12.073
it spread everywhere,

00:18:12.274 --> 00:18:15.059
and now it is about enjoying it.

00:18:15.260 --> 00:18:19.678
There are many different type of people in the world,

00:18:19.881 --> 00:18:22.557
but they cannot touch you,

00:18:22.758 --> 00:18:25.146
cannot bother you.

00:18:25.347 --> 00:18:27.952
If at all something happens,

00:18:28.156 --> 00:18:30.555
then it will be that they become one among you

00:18:30.756 --> 00:18:32.327
and they would turn in your favour.

00:18:32.528 --> 00:18:34.336
After seeing your life,

00:18:34.537 --> 00:18:40.964
they will at least be inclined to change themselves,

00:18:41.165 --> 00:18:43.026
they will think: "Let us also change".

00:18:43.227 --> 00:18:44.854
I don't say that

00:18:45.055 --> 00:18:48.842
I have taken the responsibility of changing this whole world

00:18:49.043 --> 00:18:52.434
but you can take this responsibility.

00:18:52.635 --> 00:18:55.037
If you change this world,

00:18:55.238 --> 00:19:01.384
if you create virtuous and saintly people,

00:19:01.585 --> 00:19:07.262
then after that there is no need to do anything else.

00:19:07.431 --> 00:19:11.151
Then you just witness and enjoy it.

00:19:11.352 --> 00:19:13.272
The only important thing is

00:19:13.473 --> 00:19:18.440
that you get fully involved into it, start working it out

00:19:18.641 --> 00:19:21.981
and see how many people you can transform.

00:19:22.182 --> 00:19:26.529
It is agreed that an ordinary human being has got a number of flaws.

00:19:26.730 --> 00:19:31.719
Such human being who is full of flaws

00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:40.145
can be beautifully introduced to his great unknown Self.

00:19:40.346 --> 00:19:44.067
The Self that is within you, the Atma that is within you -

00:19:44.268 --> 00:19:49.087
when you get introduced to it,

00:19:49.288 --> 00:19:52.994
then you realize that others must do the same.

00:19:53.195 --> 00:19:54.664
They should also know themselves.

00:19:54.865 --> 00:19:56.227
They are lost.

00:19:56.428 --> 00:20:01.033
They don't know what a treasure they have inside.

00:20:01.234 --> 00:20:03.511
So, this (Realization) must be given,

00:20:03.712 --> 00:20:06.484
and they must get it.

00:20:06.685 --> 00:20:09.994
When such discussions begin,

00:20:10.167 --> 00:20:13.180
you will take this responsibility on yourself

00:20:13.381 --> 00:20:17.984
that, "We should give others this treasure, too".

00:20:18.185 --> 00:20:20.636
You have the key to their treasure,

00:20:20.823 --> 00:20:27.912
and if somehow you give this great gift to them,

00:20:28.113 --> 00:20:33.019
then you will see how they are going to recognize you

00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.715
and how they will be grateful to you.

00:20:36.916 --> 00:20:39.592
The greatest work for you now

00:20:39.793 --> 00:20:44.724
is to bring as many people as you can to that Sahaja state,

00:20:44.925 --> 00:20:46.611
and give them this treasure.

00:20:46.812 --> 00:20:49.221
And when this will happen,

00:20:49.422 --> 00:20:53.843
you will yourself get fully immersed in it and happy

00:20:54.044 --> 00:20:58.123
and you will get a kind of joy,

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.762
which cannot be described.

00:21:02.963 --> 00:21:04.712
This has to be done.

00:21:04.913 --> 00:21:08.150
Today you have celebrated My birthday,

00:21:08.351 --> 00:21:13.670
I am very thankful for that.

00:21:13.871 --> 00:21:16.673
And you have done all this so happily.

00:21:16.881 --> 00:21:18.725
For Me the important thing is

00:21:18.936 --> 00:21:23.728
that every year Sahaja Yoga spread widely

00:21:23.929 --> 00:21:28.877
and even I cannot fathom its boundaries now.

00:21:29.078 --> 00:21:33.170
But, today, you must also take a vow,

00:21:33.355 --> 00:21:36.153
on your Mother's birthday,

00:21:36.354 --> 00:21:41.272
that, "We will all try to transform others".

00:21:41.473 --> 00:21:43.444
We have already got transformed,

00:21:43.616 --> 00:21:45.821
but we should transform others as well.

00:21:46.022 --> 00:21:51.647
Only this will give you the completeness of this joy.

00:21:51.848 --> 00:21:54.286
Till now, the joy you have had is limited,

00:21:54.487 --> 00:21:56.693
but when you will spread it among others,

00:21:56.894 --> 00:21:59.355
and when it will resonate in others -

00:21:59.556 --> 00:22:07.467
having this experience and understanding it,

00:22:07.668 --> 00:22:15.475
then a great new joy will awaken within you.

00:22:15.676 --> 00:22:21.147
I was watching how young boys and children

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:25.235
were dancing so joyfully.

00:22:25.436 --> 00:22:28.438
Shri Krishna started this Holi celebration

00:22:28.639 --> 00:22:30.885
so that everybody would get a state of joy.

00:22:31.086 --> 00:22:36.567
Shri Rama's style made human beings very serious type.

00:22:36.768 --> 00:22:39.075
Their life became serious.

00:22:39.276 --> 00:22:41.581
He (Shri Krishna) devised a method

00:22:41.782 --> 00:22:45.406
so that human beings break out of their shell and play mirthfully.

00:22:45.625 --> 00:22:52.478
And only Sahaja Yogis can celebrate it (Holi) in a proper way

00:22:52.679 --> 00:22:54.580
with love amongst themselves.

00:22:54.781 --> 00:22:57.913
They do not celebrate to trouble others

00:22:58.121 --> 00:23:01.076
but to express their own joy

00:23:01.281 --> 00:23:05.215
and to make others feel joyous as well.

00:23:05.431 --> 00:23:09.221
Eternal blessings to everyone.
