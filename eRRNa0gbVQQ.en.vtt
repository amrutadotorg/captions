00:07.260 --> 00:11.857
Now, put your left hand towards Me, comfortably.

00:12.057 --> 00:15.426
Put your feet apart from each other.

00:15.626 --> 00:19.552
And now put your right hand on your heart

00:19.752 --> 00:23.107
and close your eyes.

00:29.185 --> 00:33.770
Here you have to ask Me a very important question,

00:34.039 --> 00:36.149
in your heart.

00:36.349 --> 00:40.715
You ask Me a question as you would ask a computer.

00:40.915 --> 00:44.306
You can call Me “Shri Mataji” or “Mother”, whatever you like.

00:44.506 --> 00:48.403
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

00:49.011 --> 00:52.248
Ask the question, in your heart, not loudly.

00:52.448 --> 00:55.661
Three times ask in your heart, not loudly,

00:55.861 --> 01:00.826
“Mother, am I the spirit?”

01:01.227 --> 01:05.973
You have to only ask in your heart.

01:12.742 --> 01:16.618
If you are the spirit you become your own guide,

01:16.818 --> 01:22.482
you become your own master, you become your own guru.

01:22.682 --> 01:26.264
So now take down your right hand

01:26.464 --> 01:31.782
into the upper portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

01:32.586 --> 01:39.877
And here you have to ask another question,

01:40.197 --> 01:44.488
three times, not loudly, in your heart,

01:44.688 --> 01:52.951
“Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own master?”

01:53.151 --> 01:57.012
Ask this question three times.

02:13.354 --> 02:16.838
“Am I my own master?”

02:20.137 --> 02:25.313
I have told you that I respect your freedom,

02:25.513 --> 02:30.157
and the pure knowledge cannot be forced on you.

02:30.357 --> 02:34.202
So please take your right hand

02:34.402 --> 02:39.055
in the lower portion of your abdomen,

02:39.255 --> 02:44.696
and say it six times, asking Me,

02:44.896 --> 02:48.418
“Mother, please give me pure knowledge.”

02:48.618 --> 02:54.625
I cannot force on you. You have to ask in your free will.

03:12.064 --> 03:17.161
As soon as you ask for the pure knowledge,

03:17.361 --> 03:20.282
the kundalini starts moving upward.

03:20.482 --> 03:23.096
So now we have to nourish

03:23.296 --> 03:28.549
the higher centers with our self-confidence.

03:33.289 --> 03:41.293
Raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen.

03:42.200 --> 03:46.915
Press it hard, on the left-hand side.

03:47.115 --> 03:51.069
And here with full confidence you have to say ten times,

03:51.269 --> 03:55.555
in your heart, not loudly,

03:55.755 --> 04:00.020
“Mother, I am my own master.” Please say this ten times,

04:00.220 --> 04:05.895
“Mother, I am my own master.”

04:25.351 --> 04:27.522
I told you at the very outset

04:27.722 --> 04:31.064
that the greatest truth about you is that

04:31.264 --> 04:36.080
you are not this body, you are not this mind,

04:36.280 --> 04:41.406
you are not these conditionings, emotions, nor this ego,

04:41.606 --> 04:46.109
but you are the spirit. You are the pure spirit.

04:46.309 --> 04:50.075
So now raise your right hand

04:51.142 --> 04:59.425
onto your heart and ask here,

05:03.671 --> 05:09.166
or say with full confidence, twelve times,

05:09.378 --> 05:13.198
“Mother, I am the spirit.”

05:13.398 --> 05:18.318
Just say it without any hesitation.

05:18.518 --> 05:21.991
Say it twelve times, please.

05:38.696 --> 05:43.621
For your information you have to know

05:43.821 --> 05:50.170
that the divine Power is the source of knowledge,

05:50.370 --> 05:57.846
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of love.

05:58.046 --> 06:03.034
It is the ocean of peace and ocean of bliss.

06:03.234 --> 06:09.321
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

06:09.521 --> 06:12.152
So you cannot commit any mistake

06:12.352 --> 06:17.999
which cannot be dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

06:18.199 --> 06:23.892
So please raise your right hand in the corner of your neck,

06:24.092 --> 06:26.434
and your shoulder,

06:26.634 --> 06:28.703
push it back as much as possible

06:28.903 --> 06:31.477
and turn your head to your right,

06:31.677 --> 06:38.351
and with full confidence please say sixteen times,

06:39.272 --> 06:42.091
full confidence, in your heart,

06:42.291 --> 06:49.107
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.”

07:03.439 --> 07:05.055
All right.

07:08.356 --> 07:15.861
As I told you before that you have to forgive everyone,

07:16.061 --> 07:18.782
and those who say it is difficult, they must know

07:18.982 --> 07:23.976
that it is a myth whether you forgive or don’t forgive.

07:24.342 --> 07:27.327
But if you don’t forgive then you play into the wrong hands

07:27.527 --> 07:31.320
and get yourself tortured by yourself.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.690
So please forgive – in general, everyone,

07:34.890 --> 07:36.937
not counting how many people you have to forgive,

07:37.137 --> 07:39.347
what you have to forgive – but just say,

07:39.547 --> 07:44.025
by raising your hand and putting it

07:44.225 --> 07:46.769
on top of your forehead across,

07:46.969 --> 07:50.360
putting down your head as much as possible,

07:50.560 --> 07:53.371
resting on your hand.

07:53.571 --> 07:59.982
Please say, with an open heart please say,

08:00.182 --> 08:05.107
“Mother, I forgive everyone.”

08:12.019 --> 08:14.314
Please say it, please say;

08:14.514 --> 08:17.099
otherwise it is difficult later on for Me:

08:17.299 --> 08:20.923
I have to clear out everybody’s Agnya

08:21.123 --> 08:23.426
and this takes too much time then.

08:23.626 --> 08:26.453
So best is to say it from your heart. After all,

08:26.653 --> 08:31.912
you are not going to miss your Self-realization for that.

08:35.294 --> 08:42.326
Now take back your right hand on the back side of your head,

08:42.590 --> 08:45.469
and put your head on it,

08:45.669 --> 08:50.276
resting on it, upward.

08:50.654 --> 08:54.307
Here you have to say for your own satisfaction,

08:54.507 --> 08:59.547
“Oh Divine, if I have done any mistakes, please forgive me.”

08:59.747 --> 09:01.510
But don’t feel guilty,

09:01.710 --> 09:04.241
don’t count your mistakes, don’t think about them.

09:04.441 --> 09:05.913
In general you have to say,

09:06.113 --> 09:12.445
“Oh Divine, please forgive me if I have done any mistakes

09:12.645 --> 09:20.249
or anything wrong, anything against You.”

09:21.381 --> 09:23.859
Now, stretch your palm,

09:24.059 --> 09:27.514
stretch your palm and put the center of your palm

09:27.714 --> 09:31.750
on top of the fontanel bone area

09:31.950 --> 09:35.529
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

09:35.729 --> 09:40.897
Now put down your head properly.

09:41.097 --> 09:46.255
And here push back your fingers as far as possible.

09:46.455 --> 09:49.028
Please push back. This is very important.

09:49.228 --> 09:52.258
And now put a pressure on your scalp,

09:52.458 --> 09:55.087
and move your scalp slowly

09:55.281 --> 09:58.444
seven times clockwise.

09:58.596 --> 10:01.907
Here again I respect your freedom,

10:02.107 --> 10:06.222
and I cannot force Self-realization on you.

10:06.422 --> 10:09.200
So here you have to say seven times,

10:09.400 --> 10:11.828
bending your head properly

10:12.028 --> 10:15.001
and pressing it hard, moving seven times,

10:15.317 --> 10:19.602
“Mother, please give me my Self-realization.”

10:19.866 --> 10:23.922
Please ask seven times, please.
