00:00:06.169 --> 00:00:11.929
Yogi: In the year 1947, P.K. Salve was a
Member of the Central Legislative Assembly
at Delhi,

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.737
while Nirmala was studying in Her 4th year
of Medicine, at Lahore. It was at this

00:00:16.737 --> 00:00:21.062
juncture that a tall, young man was
introduced into the Salve household.

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:27.383
His name was Chandrika Prasad Shrivastav.
Chandrika Prasad Shrivastav was a college

00:00:27.383 --> 00:00:33.024
friend of Nirmala's older brother Narendra
Kumar Salve. He was temporarily working

00:00:33.024 --> 00:00:37.356
for the Ministry of Commerce in Delhi and
needed a place to stay for a few days.

00:00:37.356 --> 00:00:41.829
Narendra Kumar invited him to stay as a
house guest at the Feroze Shah Road house

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.350
and C.P. Shrivastav accepted the invitation.
Little did he know, that this was a move,

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.664
that would change his life in such a significant
manner. He soon became very popular in the

00:00:53.664 --> 00:00:58.785
large Salve family, both among the elders
and the young. It was natural therefore,

00:00:58.785 --> 00:01:03.265
for Narendra Kumar to think of him as a
suitable match for his sister, Nirmala.

00:01:03.463 --> 00:01:10.073
Shri Mataji: In our country, in those days, there
was no choice, nothing. Whatever parents said,

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:16.558
you had to listen. So, according to the
choice of My parents, they selected him.

00:01:16.558 --> 00:01:24.201
He was a friend of My brother and My brother
said, "He's a very nice person, this, that,"

00:01:24.744 --> 00:01:28.814
so they married Me to him; That's what
it is.

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:35.664
Yogi: On the 7th of April 1947, Nirmala Salve
and C.P. Shrivastav were married in a simple

00:01:35.664 --> 00:01:41.239
civil ceremony. It was a unique marriage
from all angles.

00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:44.892
There was hardly anything common between
the two.

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:52.771
Sir C.P. Shrivastav: This was a situation of a very
remarkable kind. I came, as I told you, from a,

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:59.528
from old families, conservative families,
pro-establishment families, you know, land

00:01:59.528 --> 00:02:06.996
holders and She was a family, fighting
the British - totally on the other side,

00:02:07.374 --> 00:02:13.934
so it was a totally different background.
My background was totally different and

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:23.700
I was from UP but that particular community,
She belonged them of another community,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.903
as you know, so there was nothing common
between us, as far as heritage goes.

00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:35.937
Yogi: But despite the regional, cultural and
linguistic differences, there was a very

00:02:35.937 --> 00:02:42.662
strong common point that they both shared
- their love for their country, their love for India.

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:53.307
And soon, they both saw their biggest dream come
true - the dream of seeing India as a free nation.

00:02:53.324 --> 00:02:58.384
Sir C.P. Shrivastav: On 15th August, we were
together standing with the whole family, Salve

00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:06.367
family, in front of the Secretariat, watching
the Union flag going down and the Indian
flag going up -

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:13.170
India becoming independent. So we together,
which we wanted very much, saw India rising.

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.349
Yogi: In the early years of Her marriage, Nirmala
Salve lived like a normal housewife, with

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:25.196
Her extraordinary husband. They soon had
two lovely daughters, Kalpana and Sadhana

00:03:25.196 --> 00:03:33.422
and Nirmala's life was woven around their
upbringing and education. Wherever he went

00:03:33.422 --> 00:03:38.314
as an officer of the prestigious Indian
Administrative Service, Mr. C.P. Shrivastav

00:03:38.314 --> 00:03:43.563
distinguished himself with his extreme
efficiency, honesty and academic brilliance.

00:03:45.001 --> 00:03:50.511
Shri Mataji was right besides C.P. Shrivastav
in all the ups and downs of his high office.

00:03:50.885 --> 00:03:56.165
She was no silent housewife, in fact She took
active interest in the affairs of the state

00:03:56.165 --> 00:04:00.686
and was part of many a discussion, which 
eventually shaped the National policy.

00:04:00.981 --> 00:04:06.161
The Tashkent Agreement was a high point in
the diplomatic life of Mr. C.P. Shrivastav.

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:15.116
However, the untimely death of the Prime
Minister, while still at Tashkent, was like

00:04:15.116 --> 00:04:20.438
a bolt from the blue and was a huge loss to
the nation. For Mr. C.P. Shrivastav and his

00:04:20.438 --> 00:04:27.222
family, it was a great personal loss. Soon
afterwards, Mr. C.P. Shrivastav was made

00:04:27.222 --> 00:04:31.801
The Chairman and Managing Director of The
Shipping Corporation of India and the whole

00:04:31.801 --> 00:04:37.291
family shifted to Bombay. Here too, he
excelled beyond all expectations and was

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:42.640
lauded universally for making SCI the
largest Public Sector Company in India, in

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:50.225
the shortest possible time. In the meanwhile,
Shri Mataji was readying Herself for a much

00:04:50.225 --> 00:04:55.876
larger role in the world. Both Her daughters
were, more or less, settled in life and

00:04:55.876 --> 00:05:01.409
She was now in a position to give more
time to Her deepest interest, Spirituality.

00:05:02.566 --> 00:05:07.936
Until now, She had been an excellent wife
and a loving Mother but it was time to

00:05:07.936 --> 00:05:13.717
fulfill Her true destiny, it was time to
become the Loving Mother to the whole world.
