00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:14,340
So here, what happens that when the Kundalini
rises, when she goes to the Agnya Chakra which

2
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:20,820
represents, as you say, the third eye or whatever
you may call it – it is between the optic chiasma,

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:25,140
and it looks after the
pituitary and the pineal body.

4
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,853
And as a result we have developed two
institutions called ego and superego.

5
00:00:33,060 --> 00:00:36,240
The ego is the one which tells us “I have done it.

6
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,740
I am doing this."

7
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:45,780
Both these institutions are sucked in by the
enlightenment of this center and that’s how

8
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:52,440
the thing opens out, and all your karmas are
sucked in, so there’s no problem of karmas.

9
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,820
Only human beings think that they
are doing karmas; animals don’t.

10
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:00,153
They have no sense of sin or anything.

11
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,420
They are completely under the bondage of God,

12
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,842
so in Sanskrit they are called as
“pashu” – means “under the bondage."

13
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,300
But we are the ones, we have got freedom.

14
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:12,420
And that’s why we think we have done this and we

15
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:15,660
have done that; and we should not
do this, we should not do that.

16
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:23,640
But when the Kundalini rises and she awakens this
center, then both these things are sucked in.

17
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:30,909
And when they are sucked in, then you do not
do any karmas anymore, you just are in akarma.

18
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,300
You do everything – I mean, I travel, you
know, such a lot and I have a family, and

19
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:43,680
everything is there; but is just happening, I am
just seeing it, I am not doing anything as such.

20
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:50,220
So when you are also awakened, there’s
no obligation, it’s just happening.

21
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,120
It isso.

22
00:01:52,882 --> 00:02:02,509
It is here where we should understand that this center
is bestowed upon by the great life of Christ.

23
00:02:03,105 --> 00:02:09,602
Christ is there, and they said that He died
for our sins, died for our karmas – is a fact.

24
00:02:09,851 --> 00:02:14,627
Because when He is awakened these
two institutions are pulled in

25
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:20,880
inside, and you get your Kundalini
out there – it opens out.

26
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:28,467
And this bone which had been calcified opens
out, and the kundalini pierces through.
