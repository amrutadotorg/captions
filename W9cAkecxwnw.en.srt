Her Holiness SHRI MATAJI NIRMALA DEVI
Public Program, Toronto

2
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:29,630
June 15, 1989

3
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:34,020
YOGI: Shri Mataji has arrived and I would
like to tell you that I have been with Her

4
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:45,710
for about thirteen years and I have seen the
miracles that She has performed in giving

5
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,280
people the experience that they have sought
for lifetimes. She is renowned in India as

6
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,510
the greatest living saint, She is known throughout
Europe. In Italy they have recognized Her

7
00:00:51,510 --> 00:01:02,040
as the Mother and I hope in North America
you recognize who She truly is. And She has

8
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:04,710
come here to give you all what you have been
seeking for lifetimes and the only need to

9
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:18,340
do tonight is to have an open mind, the mind
of a scientist – not deny it, but just listen

10
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:29,110
to what Mother has to say and have the experience
and when you have the experience you cannot

11
00:01:29,110 --> 00:01:32,691
deny it, because no scientist denies the results
of his experiments. So I hope you will all

12
00:01:32,691 --> 00:02:22,900
have this experience of self Realization and
I now present Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

13
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:52,460
Shri Mataji: I bow to all seekers of truth.
At the very outset it should be understood

14
00:02:52,460 --> 00:03:04,840
that truth is what it is. We cannot organize
it, we cannot change it, we cannot conceptualize

15
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:20,610
it. So if we have some ideas about truth we
have to know that it is to be known to us.

16
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:32,880
This is what is called as the self knowledge.
Through self knowledge only you can know the

17
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:43,490
truth. Before self knowledge is not possible
because whatever we know through our mental

18
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:58,290
efforts, through our emotional feelings is
relative. We find a person falls in love with

19
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:07,200
someone – and after ten days you find him
walking to a divorce-case. We find a person

20
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:21,690
who says, “This is the best way for us”
– and after some time we find he is in great

21
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:33,210
trouble. In every way we find that whatever
we say is true before Self Realization, is

22
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:43,249
very relative. It may be all right, it may
not be all right, it may work out, it may

23
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:51,699
not work out – there is no definiteness
about it. Especially the mental projection,

24
00:04:51,699 --> 00:05:02,189
as it is, always moves in a linear direction
and then it recoils back upon you. But self

25
00:05:02,189 --> 00:05:13,460
knowledge is a thing where your self is the
one which gives you wisdom of the Divine.

26
00:05:13,460 --> 00:05:24,610
But the light of the self comes in your attention,
then in that light you know what is the truth.

27
00:05:24,610 --> 00:05:30,349
For example somebody is standing with a snake
in his hand and it is all darkness – you

28
00:05:30,349 --> 00:05:36,849
tell that person, “This is a snake”, he
is not going to believe you. He’ll say,

29
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:44,029
“All right, I don’t think so, I believe
it is a rope.” So no use arguing with such

30
00:05:44,029 --> 00:05:53,039
a person. Best is to put the light on – so
let him have a look at it and then he just

31
00:05:53,039 --> 00:06:07,039
drops out the snake. In the same manner, when
the self knowledge comes into our awareness

32
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:17,550
we start feeling the All-pervading power which
is described as Ruah, described as the All-pervading

33
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:30,039
power of God’s love, described as Brahmachaitanya
- call it by any name – for the first time

34
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:38,559
you start feeling on your fingertips. You
have never felt it before. Now when you start

35
00:06:38,559 --> 00:06:46,400
feeling it on your fingertips, these centers
that are there are the sympathetic centers

36
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:53,419
five, six and seven on the left-hand side,
same sympathetic, on the right-hand side we

37
00:06:53,419 --> 00:07:02,909
have seven centers. So you start feeling them.
Feeling your own centers and feeling the centers

38
00:07:02,909 --> 00:07:14,219
of others when this enlightenment comes on
your central nervous system.

39
00:07:14,219 --> 00:07:23,159
We have become human beings through our evolutionary
process. We don’t realize how much better

40
00:07:23,159 --> 00:07:31,960
evolved we are than the animals. For example
if you want a dog or a horse to pass through

41
00:07:31,960 --> 00:07:38,069
a very dirty lane he’ll just walk through,
it’s not bothered, but for a human being

42
00:07:38,069 --> 00:07:45,090
it’s an impossible situation. In so many
ways we are evolved, but there is a little

43
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:51,499
bit left – this last breakthrough has to
work out about which all the saints have written

44
00:07:51,499 --> 00:07:59,469
that, ‘you should know thyself’. If you
do not know yourself, then you cannot know

45
00:07:59,469 --> 00:08:06,619
anything about God. No use talking about God,
about religion. Now you find that people who

46
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:16,520
follow any religion whatsoever, any religion
– say maybe a Hindu, Christian, Muslim,

47
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:25,379
Sikh - any religion he may be following, he
can commit any sin. There is no restriction.

48
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:32,909
Nobody says that, “I cannot commit this
sin, because I am such and such.” So there

49
00:08:32,909 --> 00:08:45,050
is no compulsion to remain holy by following
anything. So there is something missing about

50
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:51,370
it which one has to know – what is the point
we have missed. There’s nothing wrong in

51
00:08:51,370 --> 00:08:58,840
any religion, all these great prophets were
born on the Tree of Life, like living flowers,

52
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:06,220
and they were plucked by us and then we say,
“This is mine, this is mine”, and we are

53
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:13,980
fighting – but actually they all belong
to one Tree of Life. So what was the common

54
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:19,750
thing that they talked and which we have missed
in practically in every religious seeking

55
00:09:19,750 --> 00:09:32,810
was this: that we have to seek the eternal,
we have to seek the eternal and the transitory

56
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:40,389
is to be used in moderation, in its own limitation
and in its full understanding.

57
00:09:40,389 --> 00:09:49,380
Today’s problems of ecology, this, that
– all these things come from human error

58
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:58,550
and the human error is because they have not
found out the eternal. When you find out the

59
00:09:58,550 --> 00:10:08,600
eternal then you become a balanced personality,
absolutely a balanced personality and the

60
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:19,459
balance comes from divine wisdom. All the
problems today are because human beings are

61
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:32,870
not at that level of self knowledge, because
human beings are still relatively living.

62
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,430
One person thinks this is good, another thinks
this is good and that’s how we exploit each

63
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:46,870
other, we exploit the nature, we create problems
and everything repels on us, because transitory

64
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:56,709
things as you know are transitory, because
they have inbuilt quality to get destroyed.

65
00:10:56,709 --> 00:11:09,190
They get destroyed and gradually we learn
from them how to destroy. But human beings

66
00:11:09,190 --> 00:11:20,610
are the epitome of evolution. God has created
human beings as the highest creation. Maybe

67
00:11:20,610 --> 00:11:29,579
we have been given freedom, a complete freedom
to choose. If we want to go to heaven we can

68
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:36,830
go, if we want to go to hell, we can go. So
this freedom we have been acting on, we can

69
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:47,670
say as trial and error, error and trial, and
ultimately a stage has to reach where we start

70
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:58,959
thinking, what mistake did we commit? Where
did we go wrong? And there we have to realize

71
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:05,450
that the eternal we have not sought.

72
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:15,060
We see this miracle - say of flowers – we
see the flowers, how beautiful they are, created

73
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:25,449
by nature. We can’t create even one of them.
Spontaneously they appear according to the

74
00:12:25,449 --> 00:12:36,889
different categories they belong. The choice,
such a big choice – all this and many other

75
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:45,970
such living things are done by this divine
power. But we take it for granted, we just

76
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:53,670
take it for granted and the greatest thing
that has happened is that, that today human

77
00:12:53,670 --> 00:13:04,209
beings are brought to this level that now
they have become divine computers. They can

78
00:13:04,209 --> 00:13:11,500
become divine computers. It’s a very beautiful
thing that is ahead of us – only thing we

79
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:21,160
should know that we have to grow into that
new awareness. This is called as the one that

80
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:27,810
we call knowledge. Knowledge is not mental
knowledge, by reading you do not become. Kabira

81
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:34,880
once said that by reading too much the great
learned people have become stupid. First I

82
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,410
used to think, how can that be? [SOUNDS LIKE:
Badi, badi pantita murrachaweiy ?]. I used

83
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:45,930
to think, by reading how can people become
stupid? The thing is, when you read all others

84
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:55,080
are in your head, but you are not there. And
this is, I find today, that we think by reading

85
00:13:55,080 --> 00:14:02,040
we’ll become the knowledge. Knowledge will
be, but that’s not a absolute knowledge,

86
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:07,370
that’s not. That is a relative knowledge.
To get to the absolute knowledge you have

87
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:14,769
to become something, you have to become the
Spirit. And once you become the Spirit this

88
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:22,970
knowledge is just manifested. It can be manifested
even in a little child and a child can know.

89
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:30,449
It’s a subjective knowledge, you can say,
but absolute. It is not arbitrary, it’s

90
00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:37,509
collective. You put ten children who are realized
and ask them, what’s wrong with this person?

91
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:44,040
Immediately they’ll raise the same finger.
This is the thing. Now ask that person, something

92
00:14:44,040 --> 00:14:50,050
wrong with your throat? Are you suffering
from some trouble? He’ll say, “Yes, how

93
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:56,300
do you know?” These children are telling
Me. So only the decoding is needed afterwards

94
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:02,259
that - what’s wrong with you, what finger
is burning? What is the problem and what does

95
00:15:02,259 --> 00:15:09,930
it relate to? You have to just know how to
correct it. And once you know the art of correcting

96
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:16,579
it, you can correct and you can perfect it.
It’s very easy to master this art.

97
00:15:16,579 --> 00:15:21,910
Of course, you must know you can’t pay for
anything like this. How much did we pay to

98
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:28,930
the Mother Earth when She sprouted the seeds?
If it’s a living process you don’t pay

99
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:40,800
for anything. Living processes do not understand
money. How can you pay for these flowers when

100
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,240
you have to pay to the Mother Earth? Of course
you can pay to the florist – that’s a

101
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:50,800
different point, but to the Mother Earth you
cannot pay. She does all the job without any

102
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:56,180
payment. In the same way this is a living
process and you must know that you cannot

103
00:15:56,180 --> 00:16:01,410
pay for it. Anybody who says that, “I’m
doing God’s work, I’m doing this work

104
00:16:01,410 --> 00:16:07,930
for emancipation of your soul,” and all
that and takes money – tell him that he

105
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:17,009
should redeem his own soul first. You cannot
pay for it, you cannot put in effort also,

106
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:24,770
because it is a spontaneous thing. Sahaja
means: saha … with, ja …born with you

107
00:16:24,770 --> 00:16:32,089
- is the right of this union with the Divine,
is the Yoga. For this you cannot pay, nor

108
00:16:32,089 --> 00:16:40,920
can you command, nor can you demand. You cannot
ask – it just works.

109
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:47,371
So it’s so simple. Now some people say,
“Mother, how can it be so simple?” Anything

110
00:16:47,371 --> 00:16:53,560
that is vital, isn’t it simple? As soon
as we are born we know how to breathe. Who

111
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:59,870
teaches us how to breathe? Automatically we
start breathing. Anything that is important

112
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:08,880
has to be simple, cannot be complicated. Now
about this subject I must have given thousands

113
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:14,589
and thousands of lectures in English language
itself, leave alone other languages. So there’s

114
00:17:14,589 --> 00:17:21,000
no end to it but as I always say that when
we come in this room we see so many lights

115
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:27,189
– only thing we have to put on one switch
and the lights are there. If I start telling

116
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:32,730
you the history of light and the source of
these lights and the electricity, from where

117
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:40,000
it has come, you’ll be just fed up, but
it’s all built-in. So why bother, just have

118
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:47,360
the lights on. In the same way it’s all
built-in within you all these beautiful things,

119
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:55,320
these centers and chakras. Of course we have
to admit one thing, that in the West this

120
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:03,030
civilization has grown like a tree outside,
but it has not sought its roots. This is the

121
00:18:03,030 --> 00:18:12,110
knowledge of the roots and without the roots
the tree cannot exist and the roots have no

122
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:17,860
meaning if there is no tree. So it is all
inter-dependent, so we must have the knowledge

123
00:18:17,860 --> 00:18:25,060
of the roots and we have to know all about
it. It is very simple and you all can become

124
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:27,570
masters.

125
00:18:27,570 --> 00:18:29,400
May God bless you all!

126
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:36,910
Shri Mataji: I want to have some questions
from you. Questions should be related to the

127
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:43,070
subject, because I have not come here to seek
any money, seek any power or votes or anything.

128
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:49,840
I’ve come here to tell you what is for the
benevolence of your being and as a result

129
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:58,210
of a collective, in the sense, emancipation
of the humanity. So please ask Me positive

130
00:18:58,210 --> 00:18:59,251
questions which will help you.

131
00:18:59,251 --> 00:19:00,251
Aside: Can you get … [ Mala ?]

132
00:19:00,251 --> 00:19:01,251
FEMALE SEEKER: When you walked in …when
you walked in … when you walked in I have

133
00:19:01,251 --> 00:19:22,340
seen one big energy here, of purple - is it
my [power ?] or Your energy?

134
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:31,220
YOGI: (to the seeker:) Could you repeat that,
I couldn’t follow.

135
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:37,260
(to Shri Mataji:) I think, apparently she
is saying, when You walked in, she saw some

136
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,260
big energy force. (to the seeker:) Is that
right?

137
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:39,260
FEMALE SEEKER: When Shri Mataji walked in
I could see one purple energy.

138
00:19:39,260 --> 00:19:40,260
YOGI: Purple?

139
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:41,260
FEMALE SEEKER: Purple energy.

140
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,260
YOGI: Aha!

141
00:19:42,260 --> 00:19:45,680
FEMALE SEEKER: And I was wondering if it’s
my energy or if it’s Her energy, means … [INDIST.]

142
00:19:45,680 --> 00:19:50,210
Shri Mataji: (laughing) What’s that?

143
00:19:50,210 --> 00:19:55,850
YOGI: She said, when You walked in, she saw
some purple energy and she is wondering whether

144
00:19:55,850 --> 00:19:56,940
it is her energy or Your energy.

145
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:08,900
Shri Mataji: You see all these seeing things
are out of question, because if you see something

146
00:20:08,900 --> 00:20:17,760
you are not that. Supposing you see the light
– then you are not the light. So it’s

147
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:24,220
not important. We have to be the light, we
have to be the energy.

148
00:20:24,220 --> 00:20:27,870
(to the audience:) Yes please!

149
00:20:27,870 --> 00:20:39,680
SEEKER: Yes, You were talking about the tree,
were You talking about the Tree of Life, or

150
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
were you talking about the roots of the tree
…

151
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,120
Shri Mataji: I …

152
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,120
YOGI: When You are talking about the tree,
are you talking about the tree of life?

153
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,120
Shri Mataji: Of course!

154
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:47,160
ANOTHER SEEKER: Shri Mataji, I would like
to know who was your spiritual teacher? [INDIST.:

155
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:55,660
SOUNDS LIKE: As you belong to a spiritual
teacher as You are]

156
00:20:55,660 --> 00:21:00,710
YOGI: He is asking who was Your spiritual
teacher?

157
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:08,790
Shri Mataji: (laughing) Who was the spiritual
teacher of Christ? I had no teacher.

158
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:11,370
SEEKER: You had no teacher?

159
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:19,590
Shri Mataji: There’s no need to have a teacher.
When you become the Spirit you are your own

160
00:21:19,590 --> 00:21:26,440
teacher. You can be born like that. But of
course there must be something about Me which

161
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:30,580
is better that you discover it through your
self knowledge.

162
00:21:30,580 --> 00:21:33,870
(to the audience:) Yes, please!

163
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:44,390
ANOTHER SEEKER: The gentleman who is standing
beside you said that in Your presence we will

164
00:21:44,390 --> 00:21:48,990
experience some sort of a spiritual power.

165
00:21:48,990 --> 00:21:51,620
Shri Mataji: Yes [INDIST. ]

166
00:21:51,620 --> 00:21:57,050
SEEKER: Ah, I‘m a candidate who would like
to experience.

167
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,310
YOGI: (to Shri Mataji:) He says that I told
them that in Your presence they would experience

168
00:22:01,310 --> 00:22:05,060
–will have a spiritual experience and he
says that he is a canditate and he would like

169
00:22:05,060 --> 00:22:06,060
the experience.

170
00:22:06,060 --> 00:22:11,150
Shri Mataji: Very good! You are a real sadakar,
a real seeker. What a beautiful question,

171
00:22:11,150 --> 00:22:13,490
thank you very much.

172
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:31,130
ANOTHER SEEKER: Yeah, what I would like to
know is that, once you reach that state of

173
00:22:31,130 --> 00:22:36,920
your own Kundalini, are there any possibilities
that you can lose it?

174
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:42,531
YOGI: (to Shri Mataji:) He says, once you
achieve that status– is it possible that

175
00:22:42,531 --> 00:22:43,531
you can lose it?

176
00:22:43,531 --> 00:22:44,531
Shri Mataji: No, you don’t lose it, but
it’s like a loose connection sometimes.

177
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,531
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter) You understand,
electricity it could be little loose sometime.

178
00:22:45,531 --> 00:22:49,980
So you have to work it out and learn how to
make it really permanent – that’s all.

179
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,761
But you don’t lose it as such, energy is
there and your connection is there but it

180
00:22:55,761 --> 00:23:00,920
does happen sometimes that it’s a loose
connection. Mostly I’ve seen people get

181
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:07,060
their Realization – then they start thinking
about it. You can’t think about it, it’s

182
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:11,820
beyond thinking. Then you start thinking,
“Oh I’ve got it already, I am on top of

183
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:18,090
the world, now what is it?” But it must
be established, it’s very important and

184
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,520
you must know what it is. Of course for all
that you don’t have to pay, you don’t

185
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:27,200
have to do anything, but you have to give
some time. Why do we have watches? To save

186
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:38,700
time. Save time for what? [audience laughs]
For fixing your connections.

187
00:23:38,700 --> 00:24:06,690
FEMALE SEEKER: Once you have got the energy
all over your mind have you known anybody

188
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,150
that uses that power, that energy to do evil
or maybe turns themselves into self-style

189
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:10,150
or to do evil to others [INDIST. ]?

190
00:24:10,150 --> 00:24:11,150
Shri Mataji: Oh [INDIST.], I can’t hear
with this noise.

191
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:12,150
YOGI: She is saying that once you get this
power – do you know of anyone who after

192
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,050
getting this power uses it for evil.

193
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:21,670
Shri Mataji: No, you can’t. It’s a - you
can’t use, it’s for your benevolence,

194
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:29,110
for your hita – you can’t use it. You
just can’t do it. If you even start thinking

195
00:24:29,110 --> 00:24:35,290
of something evil, the energy will disappear,
immediately. You can’t be evil. You become

196
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:37,550
saints, you become angels.

197
00:24:37,550 --> 00:24:41,460
SEEKER: You are saying that your motives are
altruistic [commentary … ?].

198
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,140
Shri Mataji: What does he say?.

199
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:49,020
SEEKER: However we have certain expenses,
such as flowers, tickets, [preps... ?]. How

200
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:51,480
do you pay for that?

201
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:55,110
Shri Mataji: What’s happening?

202
00:24:55,110 --> 00:25:05,910
YOGI: (to Shri Mataji:) Let me answer that
question. Those of us who invited Shri Mataji

203
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:12,120
to Toronto payed for the flowers. As far as
the ticket goes, Shri Mataji usually buys

204
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,120
her own ticket.

205
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,430
Shri Mataji: Are you interested in money so
much?

206
00:25:15,430 --> 00:25:17,220
SEEKER: No! (Laughter)

207
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:22,880
Shri Mataji: Actually you see, it should not
be because I shouldn’t pay for your salvation,

208
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,800
should I? It’s not good, this doesn’t
give you self-respect, but in the beginning

209
00:25:29,800 --> 00:25:39,910
I have to do it, I know, it’s not good.
There is no harm in paying for My ticket.

210
00:25:39,910 --> 00:25:47,610
By God’s grace My husband is a rich man,
I should say in a rich family and My mother’s

211
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:53,660
family is also rich enough by God’s grace.
And they don’t mind spending this money

212
00:25:53,660 --> 00:26:04,350
because they know that this is the emancipation
of human beings. Of course the hall, I think,

213
00:26:04,350 --> 00:26:10,880
is taken by the people who are here, who think
they have achieved something – like drunkards,

214
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:18,960
you see, when they want to share their drinking
they can also arrange a hall, just to enjoy.

215
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:24,270
In the same way these who are drunk in the
beauty of God’s Love must have arranged

216
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:31,000
this hall and must have paid for it. But I
hope you don’t want Me to pay for that also.

217
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,860
(Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)

218
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:38,450
SEEKER: I just have [a simple question ?]. … [INDIST.]
… expenses, I just wanted ...

219
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:43,900
Shri Mataji: Yeah! Yes, you see – what I’m
saying that of course you have to pay for

220
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:49,500
the aeroplane, you have to pay for the hall,
but you don’t have to pay for Self Realization.

221
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:57,310
You don’t have to pay for self knowledge,
you don’t have to pay if you get cured automatically

222
00:26:57,310 --> 00:27:03,241
by the Kundalini awakening. But hall you have
to pay. But there are people who also give

223
00:27:03,241 --> 00:27:10,230
free halls to us, there are people – but
it would be very beggarish I think to have

224
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:13,510
even the hall begged from someone free. It’s
a question of self-respect.

225
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:23,031
ANOTHER SEEKER: Mataji, I have been a devotee
all my life and - to Mother, to life – and

226
00:27:23,031 --> 00:27:29,060
still recently I got sick with leukemia cancer,
do You think I have done something wrong?

227
00:27:29,060 --> 00:27:37,720
YOGI: He says he has been a devotee of the
Mother and of life for all his life, but still

228
00:27:37,720 --> 00:27:42,710
he has been ill with cancer and leukemia – has
he done something wrong?

229
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:55,340
Shri Mataji: You have done nothing wrong but
in ignorance we commit mistakes, isn’t it?

230
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:02,060
Leukemia is absolutely curable through Sahaja
Yoga, absolutely! You don’t have to do anything.

231
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:09,850
Ignorance is such that unless and until you
are connected with the Divine whatever we

232
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:18,630
do is like telephoning without our connections.
The connection has to be established. So you

233
00:28:18,630 --> 00:28:28,870
have done nothing wrong but as you have been
dedicated to Mother you have every right to

234
00:28:28,870 --> 00:28:33,990
get cured completely. Sahaja Yoga has cured.
We don’t give any medicine – it’s only

235
00:28:33,990 --> 00:28:34,990
your Kundalini, when its rises automatically
you get cured. All right?

236
00:28:34,990 --> 00:28:36,530
FEMALE SEEKER: Oh Mother, can You explain
the awakening of the Kundalini and the experience

237
00:28:36,530 --> 00:28:37,530
…

238
00:28:37,530 --> 00:28:41,420
Shri Mataji: Will you get up who is speaking?

239
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:47,028
FEMALE SEEKER: Oh Mother Mataji. Can You explain
to the people here the process when your Kundalini

240
00:28:47,028 --> 00:29:10,602
is awakened and the experiences that one gets
like I experienced and it’s very frightening

241
00:29:10,602 --> 00:29:11,602
for people who [INDIST.SOUNDS LIKE: recently
meditated and who is around You] – and you

242
00:29:11,602 --> 00:29:12,602
can’t explain it properly.

243
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:13,602
Shri Mataji: That I am going to do now only.

244
00:29:13,602 --> 00:29:23,650
FEMALE SEEKER: Like that, I had some experience,
like hissing a snake, like a little bit of

245
00:29:23,650 --> 00:29:26,210
[levitation ?], like I can hop like a frog,
I can do so many things, You know? It’s

246
00:29:26,210 --> 00:29:27,210
frightening. (Laughter)

247
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:28,750
Shri Mataji: All that’s all wrong, you can
see, we don’t have to become frogs or earthworms.

248
00:29:28,750 --> 00:29:29,750
(Laughter)

249
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:31,920
FEMALE SEEKER: [INDIST.]

250
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:39,800
Shri Mataji: My child, use your brains. (Laughter)
I mean, imagine somebody says, “You have

251
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:49,260
to hop like a frog”, breaking your bottoms
(Laughter) – absurd! All these absurd propositions

252
00:29:49,260 --> 00:30:01,410
have no meaning. Anything you talk about Divine
it has to be based on scriptures. We have

253
00:30:01,410 --> 00:30:04,700
scriptures and scriptures who have written,
seek yourself.

254
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:09,090
FEMALE SEEKER: Oh Mother, It’s [INDIST.]
Kriya Yoga by swami Vivekananda [??].

255
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:10,290
Shri Mataji: Ah, …

256
00:30:10,290 --> 00:30:11,490
YOGIS: (laugh) [INDIST!]

257
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:17,140
Shri Mataji: …you see now I don’t want
to bring controversies but Sahaja Yoga is

258
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:18,370
A-Kriya Yoga, A-Kriya.

259
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:21,240
FEMALE SEEKER: The book explains all [INDIST.].

260
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:28,220
Shri Mataji: All right, why I tell you, how
will I explain, why. Please be seated one

261
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:36,370
minute, I’ll explain to this lady. A-Kriya-Yoga
is like this: supposing you have to start

262
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:45,010
a car, if car has started and ignited then
automatically all the parts of the car starts

263
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:53,300
working. In the same way when Kundalini starts
moving, all these things like Bhandas and

264
00:30:53,300 --> 00:30:58,740
[INDIST.]take place automatically – you
wouldn’t even know about it! But Kriya Yoga

265
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:04,840
is that you take out the wheel and start moving
it from outside artificially. They cut even

266
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:16,120
the tongue of the people. Last time when I
came in 1973 …71, I found people had their

267
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:22,740
tongues wagging like dogs. They had cut it,
and what was said that you have to take it

268
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:36,280
back and this is a [Kaicheri ?]. Nonsense!
Absolute nonsense! You don’t have to do

269
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:45,350
anything outside, artificially. It just works,
because everything is built within. I was

270
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:52,600
shocked to see such prominent doctors from
India, such prominent engineers from India

271
00:31:52,600 --> 00:32:04,950
had cut their tongues, finished with all their
money and were there just living like cabbages.

272
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:16,430
You become dynamic. How can you be recluses?
If it’s that energy, which is the energy,

273
00:32:16,430 --> 00:32:22,650
which gives you comfort, which cures you,
which nourishes you. That’s the energy which

274
00:32:22,650 --> 00:32:31,190
gives you all the counseling, the energy that
gives you physical vitality, that energy which

275
00:32:31,190 --> 00:32:45,040
redeems you – do you think you’ll become
stupid people? Use your brains.

276
00:32:45,040 --> 00:32:48,560
Now there’s one gentleman who was standing
for quite some time, so I’ll give him some

277
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:49,560
time.

278
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:53,040
SEEKER: I have two questions. Number one:
we hear so much about meditation, TM, the

279
00:32:53,040 --> 00:32:54,120
power of Realization, and so on.

280
00:32:54,120 --> 00:32:55,120
Shri Mataji: All right.

281
00:32:55,120 --> 00:33:01,260
SEEKER: Could you please explain to us what’s
the difference between what you are teaching

282
00:33:01,260 --> 00:33:21,740
and what you are saying and what others have
been teaching?

283
00:33:21,740 --> 00:33:22,740
Shri Mataji: Yes!

284
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:23,740
SEEKER: The second question is the gentleman
on the left has said that when he was initiated

285
00:33:23,740 --> 00:33:24,740
it took him 2 months to realize …

286
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:28,760
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear you.

287
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:32,238
SEEKER: … why such a big gap and what one
has to do to achieve that state.

288
00:33:32,238 --> 00:33:35,070
YOGI: His first question is what is the difference
between what You are telling them about Realization

289
00:33:35,070 --> 00:33:38,960
and what others have talked, like TM and so
on – about.

290
00:33:38,960 --> 00:33:47,160
Shri Mataji: TM doesn’t say about self Realization
– I am sorry, TM never talked of self Realization.

291
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,420
They cannot.

292
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:50,930
What’s the second question?

293
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:57,300
YOGI: The second question was he was asking
why with some people it takes longer to feel

294
00:33:57,300 --> 00:34:03,420
the vibrations because I mentioned that it
took me two months to feel vibrations and

295
00:34:03,420 --> 00:34:06,120
it takes some people quickly, much quicker.

296
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:12,179
Shri Mataji: Ah! So this was from him. Some
people do take more time because this gentleman

297
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:16,930
who is here – you see – was analyzing.
You know, he is a scientist and, I know, he

298
00:34:16,930 --> 00:34:26,720
is aeronautical engineer. So he had read all
the books that are possible, had been to all

299
00:34:26,720 --> 00:34:36,300
guru-shopping that was possible. So he’s
so conditioned. So, naturally, if you are

300
00:34:36,300 --> 00:34:42,490
that conditioned you have to little bit work
it out. But also you don’t feel, after Realization

301
00:34:42,490 --> 00:34:50,260
also, if this center is not all right. This
is the center of Vishuddhi and it looks after

302
00:34:50,260 --> 00:34:57,720
your cervical plexus and your nerve cervical
now, if it’s been numbed by something then

303
00:34:57,720 --> 00:35:04,240
you don’t feel the vibrations. But others
can say if the Cool Breeze is coming out of

304
00:35:04,240 --> 00:35:11,630
your head. But normally if you have lead a
very balanced life and have not been to all

305
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:21,080
kinds of false people and that you are not
very much full of your ego then it works very

306
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:29,460
fast. Some people don’t feel but don’t
you worry, most of you are going to feel it.

307
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:30,490
So many questions in Toronto! (Shri Mataji
laughing)

308
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:37,700
FEMALE SEEKER: Mother, do you believe in reincarnation
and if so, can you please talk about it - reincarnation.

309
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:46,680
YOGI: She is asking if You believe in reincarnation,
and if You can talk about it?

310
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:54,680
Shri Mataji: I mean, of course I believe in
it. But what is there to talk about it? (Laughter)

311
00:35:54,680 --> 00:36:01,141
You will know such a lot, you have patience.
Sahaja Yoga is an ocean of knowledge. Ocean

312
00:36:01,141 --> 00:36:07,130
of knowledge. He is an aeronautical engineer,
went to all kinds of gurus and all that. Today

313
00:36:07,130 --> 00:36:13,150
he is an expert on Sahaja Yoga and there are
many you have here also who are experts. So

314
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:18,640
the knowledge is so much. Gradually you will
know each and every thing very easily, you

315
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,500
don’t have to exert about everything. Even
if I say, “I believe in something”, why

316
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:31,880
should you accept it? Why should you accept
whatever I say? You have to see for yourself

317
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,540
and know for yourself.

318
00:36:33,540 --> 00:36:36,930
FEMALE SEEKER: Because I do believe! Ahm …

319
00:36:36,930 --> 00:36:42,510
Shri Mataji: You are also believing blindly.
And if I tell you also, it will be blind.

320
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:44,160
So better is to see for yourself.

321
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:47,920
FEMALE SEEKER: Right, I have seen, but I would
like to know, ahm …

322
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:48,940
Shri Mataji: It is there.

323
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,870
FEMALE SEEKER: Because I believe You still
know more than I do.

324
00:36:50,870 --> 00:36:55,830
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, you will know everything,
madam. Everything! But your attention will

325
00:36:55,830 --> 00:36:59,900
be now more not on these things but about
self. Attention shifts.

326
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,930
SEEKER: Ah - You posed a question to me about,
did Jesus Christ have a teacher? And His teacher

327
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:07,900
was God. So I was wondering if that God is
Your spiritual teacher. When You do meditate,

328
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:24,320
do You meditate upon a light, or is it, do
You meditate upon Krishna as [it back ?] literature,

329
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,790
is it Krishna or is it…?

330
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:36,010
Shri Mataji: Just now you don’t have to
meditate on anything, you just get your Realization.

331
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:42,080
Then gradually you will know how to meditate.
See, they will tell you – because we’ll

332
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:47,730
have a course, you see, of about, I think,
four, five lessons they want to give you one

333
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:55,020
by one to tell you how to meditate. Actually
you don’t meditate, you are in meditation.

334
00:37:55,020 --> 00:38:01,540
But how to establish that meditation will
be seen individually also. Supposing you have

335
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:06,970
a certain center which is caught up, say,
then they will tell you, this is the center

336
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,820
that is caught up and this is what is to be
cleared out, and what is the Deity on that

337
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:17,060
center and that’s how you have to do. It’s
very, very simple, but very scientific and

338
00:38:17,060 --> 00:38:23,590
precise, so you don’t have to hear, you
yourself will know.

339
00:38:23,590 --> 00:38:39,454
ANOTHER SEEKER: Mother, it’s a privilege
talking to You: is it necessary for me, myself,

340
00:38:39,454 --> 00:38:40,454
to come back again and again and get born?

341
00:38:40,454 --> 00:38:41,454
Shri Mataji: What he said?

342
00:38:41,454 --> 00:38:45,310
SEEKER: Is it necessary to come back on this
planet, this Mother Earth, to take re-birth?

343
00:38:45,310 --> 00:38:51,740
To come back incarnation again and again,
is it necessary? If you have this deep self

344
00:38:51,740 --> 00:38:54,210
knowledge, can you get moksha? …

345
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:56,190
Shri Mataji: After Realization.

346
00:38:56,190 --> 00:38:58,620
YOGI: You mean after getting your Realization?

347
00:38:58,620 --> 00:39:00,690
SEEKER: Yes, but can’t you get more …?

348
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:04,880
Shri Mataji: No, not necessary at all – but
you do take [birth ?], because you want to

349
00:39:04,880 --> 00:39:05,880
help others, you see?

350
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:06,880
SEEKER: I understand that part …

351
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:13,560
Shri Mataji: Ah! But you are free, you need
not, you become absolutely free, if you want,

352
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:22,910
you will, otherwise you will not. It depends
on your own choice, it’s your own desire,

353
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:25,600
but you want to do it, because you want to
help people.

354
00:39:25,600 --> 00:39:26,600
SEEKER: I would love to help people…

355
00:39:26,600 --> 00:39:27,600
Shri Mataji: That’s good!

356
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:28,600
SEEKER: … even today! But I’m not sure,
whether I want to come back? Because during

357
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:29,600
that period of in-transit [transition ?] I
think I will forget what I may have achieved?

358
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:43,970
There may be some of us left over like from
previous lives [INDIST.]. I have been seeking

359
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,430
for years …

360
00:39:46,430 --> 00:39:54,800
Shri Mataji: Now, forget the past. And forget
the future. In the present just remember,

361
00:39:54,800 --> 00:40:03,440
you have to receive your Realization. Just
be in the present! All right? May God bless

362
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,440
you!

363
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:06,150
Now, so many (Shri Mataji laughing) – everybody
is asking questions? Yes!

364
00:40:06,150 --> 00:40:13,800
FEMALE SEEKER: I have to come back. I believe
in energy, pure energy and when I love to

365
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:38,053
see it, but to observe her I can see energies
in different colors so it’s this what I

366
00:40:38,053 --> 00:40:39,053
… You said to me when I see it then I am
not there. But you know what I mean. So what

367
00:40:39,053 --> 00:40:40,053
– ah?

368
00:40:40,053 --> 00:40:41,053
Shri Mataji: She is saying she sees the energy?

369
00:40:41,053 --> 00:40:42,053
YOGI: Yes. She sees colors.

370
00:40:42,053 --> 00:40:43,100
Shri Mataji: Now, you won’t see that anymore.

371
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:54,112
FEMALE SEEKER: But I won’t, I am not seeing,
I am feeling it and I may, ah, I think You

372
00:40:54,112 --> 00:40:55,112
know what I mean, it’s something you don’t
think that she has …

373
00:40:55,112 --> 00:40:57,690
Shri Mataji: No, no – that’s true, but
what I am saying, by seeing it you don’t

374
00:40:57,690 --> 00:41:02,560
achieve anything, you don’t get any knowledge.
You see, it’s a - you will know why you

375
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:08,960
see. You will know why you see also and you
will be corrected, all right? Just have patience

376
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,610
with yourself. Just have patience. Because
seeing these things do not give you joy, do

377
00:41:14,610 --> 00:41:19,320
not give you any power but once you are realized
you can raise the Kundalini of others. It’s

378
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:24,690
like one light which is enlightened can enlighten
another. But if you are sticking on to something

379
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:30,380
like this, “I see the energy, I want to
see this, I want to do that”, – that’s

380
00:41:30,380 --> 00:41:36,860
not going to help. What am I doing about it?
Is it going to help the humanity? Is it going

381
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:42,040
to help me? What’s the use of seeing all
these things, doing all these things – just

382
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:50,090
ask this question. As simple as that. I have
to give some meaning to my life, isn’t it?

383
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:55,310
What is the meaning of my life if I just see
things and I say, supposing I’ll go and

384
00:41:55,310 --> 00:42:03,230
tell Indians that I have seen Niagara Falls,
so what? It’s in my eyes. (Laughter)

385
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:27,430
SEEKER: Shri Mataji, uhm, I have been trying
to work with You for about one year now, and

386
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:51,170
I have skills that are causing me like this
all the time. One is my first great experience

387
00:42:51,170 --> 00:42:52,170
is with Christ and I had many great moments
working with You but occasionally I take Your

388
00:42:52,170 --> 00:42:54,040
picture and put it in my drawer for three
months and I go back saying things to me about

389
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:56,200
worshipping only Christ and I only [INDIST.],
I don’t think I have this skill - but what

390
00:42:56,200 --> 00:42:57,200
do You say about..?

391
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:58,200
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying? He is a Sahaja
Yogi?

392
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:59,200
YOGI: I don’t know what he is. He says he
has used Your picture and he has made great

393
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:00,200
experiences but he says he also had good experiences
when he has meditated on Christ, so he sometimes

394
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,200
puts Your picture away and feels …

395
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:02,200
Shri Mataji: No, no, no!

396
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,200
YOGI: … there’s a conflict.

397
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:04,200
Shri Mataji: There is no difference between
Me and Christ. What’s the difference? Not

398
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:05,200
at all! Who told you that there is a difference?

399
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,200
SEEKER: [INDIST… as Christ said. ?]

400
00:43:06,200 --> 00:43:10,250
Shri Mataji: Not at all, He existed at that
time, I exist now – that’s the difference.

401
00:43:10,250 --> 00:43:15,460
And he has talked about Me also. So it’s
all right, makes no difference. Who told you

402
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,460
there is a difference?

403
00:43:16,460 --> 00:43:17,760
SEEKER: He did! (Shri Mataji laughing & laughter)
That’s the problem.

404
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:30,220
Shri Mataji: You have to integrate, you have
to understand the integration of all the incarnations,

405
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:37,560
of all the prophets, you have to understand
that. They are all in one.

406
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:44,800
Once Guru Nanaka was sleeping, and they said,
“Your feet are towards the Mekka.” He

407
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:51,180
said, “All right, I’ll move My feet.”
He moved his feet on the other side and they

408
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:56,650
said again, “It’s towards Mekka.”

409
00:43:56,650 --> 00:44:10,660
Who was Guru Nanaka? And who was Mohammed
Sahib? And who is Me? That all is to be understood.

410
00:44:10,660 --> 00:44:17,240
You see, when Rama came, they said, “We
believed in Parashurama, because Parashurama

411
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:22,780
was dead.” It’s nice, somebody who is
dead you put him in the pocket. Parashurama

412
00:44:22,780 --> 00:44:27,970
was the same as Rama. Then came Shri Krishna
– they said, “We believe in Shri Krishna

413
00:44:27,970 --> 00:44:32,610
– ah, we don’t believe in Shri Krishna,
we believe in Rama.” Whatever is dead is

414
00:44:32,610 --> 00:44:40,610
better to believe in that, but today I am
before you. There’s no difference between

415
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:47,890
Me and Him or Nanaka, anyone, they are all
Mine. We are all related to each other, there

416
00:44:47,890 --> 00:44:53,990
is no difference at all. Even this much. Only
difference could be that today the time is

417
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:58,590
a blossomtime, we have so many seekers and
I can give en-masse Realization. They also

418
00:44:58,590 --> 00:45:06,760
said the same things, “Seek yourself!”
But Christ lived only for four years – what

419
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:11,210
do you expect anybody to do in four years?
I was in London four years struggling with

420
00:45:11,210 --> 00:45:16,800
seven hippies. I couldn’t give them Realization,
I thought that this West is all wasted, I

421
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:21,980
may not be able to work it out at all. (Laughter)
Four years - can you imagine, I was struggling

422
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:30,670
with seven hippies. (Laughter) I must say,
Christ at least was better than Me, quite

423
00:45:30,670 --> 00:45:38,520
efficient. (Laughter) I mean, nobody listened
to Him. At least you are listening to Me.

424
00:45:38,520 --> 00:45:44,941
(Laughter) Isn’t it a better thing? And
also your questioning is all right, but you

425
00:45:44,941 --> 00:45:49,450
are not angry with Me by any chance. And you
are not going to crucify Me - this is the

426
00:45:49,450 --> 00:46:02,090
difference. (Laughter) We are evolved! (Applause)
We are evolved now. Much more evolved, I must

427
00:46:02,090 --> 00:46:03,090
say.
Yes, please!

428
00:46:03,090 --> 00:46:04,090
SEEKER: Shri Mataji, [INDIST….chappels…]

429
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:05,090
Shri Mataji: Kya…? What’s this?

430
00:46:05,090 --> 00:46:06,450
YOGI: He wants to know about the experience.

431
00:46:06,450 --> 00:46:23,530
Shri Mataji: Yes! I think you are all great
people who have come here. Nobody asked Christ,

432
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:29,040
they never asked Him, “Give us the experience
of self knowledge.”

433
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,980
SEEKER: … the answer?

434
00:46:31,980 --> 00:46:37,601
Shri Mataji: Please be seated, just now we’ll
work it out, now. Now this gentleman, now

435
00:46:37,601 --> 00:46:40,790
you ask some questions, again you have some
questions, Sir?

436
00:46:40,790 --> 00:46:44,690
ANOTHER SEEKER: Yes, [INDIST … last year.
?]

437
00:46:44,690 --> 00:46:49,900
Shri Mataji: I can’t hear him at all.

438
00:46:49,900 --> 00:47:00,970
SEEKER: [INDIST.] I am sitting on the chair
and [INDIST.] there is some stop here on my

439
00:47:00,970 --> 00:47:06,830
back [INDIST.] I see myself [INDIST.] like
everyone [INDIST.] …

440
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:10,090
Shri Mataji: What’s he saying?

441
00:47:10,090 --> 00:47:13,990
SEEKER: … and the bigger one, [INDIST.]
…

442
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,950
Shri Mataji: Yeah!

443
00:47:15,950 --> 00:47:22,460
SEEKER: … and I am asking myself how it
happened [INDIST.] …

444
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:25,060
YOGI: What’s your question?

445
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:47,352
SEEKER: so what I want to know is that since
I have reached all that state of feeling something

446
00:47:47,352 --> 00:47:48,352
is coming out of my head, is that the way
what you call the stage of being conscious,

447
00:47:48,352 --> 00:47:50,750
we can call it as the experience of the Mother
of the universe [INDIST.] …

448
00:47:50,750 --> 00:47:57,560
YOGI: He has had some sort of experience of
this face expanding sideways and some ticklings

449
00:47:57,560 --> 00:47:58,560
on his back – he’s asking if that’s
the experience.

450
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:03,250
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no – not that kind,
that’s absurd. The experience is that you

451
00:48:03,250 --> 00:48:08,680
become thoughtlessly aware first of all and
you start feeling the Cool Breeze on your

452
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:15,390
fingertips, you start feeling the Cool Breeze
coming out of your head, it’s the real baptism

453
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:22,230
as we call it. All these experiences are not
there and they are not all right – they

454
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:25,410
have to be corrected.

455
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:59,120
ANOTHER SEEKER: Shri Mataji, [INDIST.] as
conscious mind and unconscious mind and we

456
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:28,020
are reading from [INDIST. ?] Whereas Sahaja
Yoga as such is spreading in the whole process

457
00:49:28,020 --> 00:49:29,020
of conscious or subconscious mind? The first
one … the second one is that there is no

458
00:49:29,020 --> 00:49:30,020
answer to my question, you are the Christ?
[??] And my third one: Why do you …

459
00:49:30,020 --> 00:49:31,020
YOGI: Could you speak up please? Can you speak
up please?

460
00:49:31,020 --> 00:49:32,020
SEEKER: …[INDIST.] since You are realizing
Your soul you begin rise above the mind, on

461
00:49:32,020 --> 00:49:33,020
so many ways and since we have not realized,
I am not Christ myself, I am not Christ, I

462
00:49:33,020 --> 00:49:34,020
do not …

463
00:49:34,020 --> 00:49:35,020
Shri Mataji: Did you follow? It’s beyond
Me. What did he say?

464
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:36,020
YOGI: The first question was, where does Sahaja
Yoga fit in like the conscious mind and the

465
00:49:36,020 --> 00:49:40,710
unconscious and Parabrahma and his second
question was that after You got your Self

466
00:49:40,710 --> 00:49:48,260
Realization You were Christ and Guru Nanak
and so on. But he hasn’t got it - so he

467
00:49:48,260 --> 00:49:51,540
isn’t. I don’t follow that man in all
specific …

468
00:49:51,540 --> 00:49:52,540
Shri Mataji: He didn’t follow your question.

469
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:53,540
YOGI: The second question!

470
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:58,600
Shri Mataji: But the – please be seated.
Please be seated. All right? Now you asked

471
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:04,420
a question which is intelligent and a good
question should be asked about the consciousness

472
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:13,250
of it. If you want to know I’ll tell you
now about it, but it is a big lecture on it

473
00:50:13,250 --> 00:50:21,220
and the other day in New York I talked to
Jungians about the conscious, the subconscious,

474
00:50:21,220 --> 00:50:31,080
the collective subconscious, but you will
know all about it, everything! So I think

475
00:50:31,080 --> 00:50:38,260
instead of wasting too much time on it, even
by knowing that, unless and until you get

476
00:50:38,260 --> 00:50:47,970
your Realization it is of no use. All right?
So the first thing is, you get your Realization

477
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:56,420
and then you will know all about it. I must
have given at least ten lectures on the construction

478
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:03,370
of unconscious and the conscious and the subconscious
and the collective subconscious and the collective

479
00:51:03,370 --> 00:51:09,000
supra-conscious and everything. All right?
That’s a very good thing you have asked

480
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:17,650
Me but just now in an introductory lecture
I would not like to talk much about it. But

481
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:23,010
there are lectures and lectures and lectures
and they will be all available to you. But

482
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:31,580
I have to tell you one simple thing that it
is not the mental knowledge, it is the love

483
00:51:31,580 --> 00:51:46,240
of God. I am here to introduce you to His
love. He is God Almighty, He is our Father,

484
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:55,230
and He loves us very much and He wants us
to enter into His kingdom as soon as possible.

485
00:51:55,230 --> 00:52:04,220
Then He looks after you every moment of your
life. And you are amazed at the miracles,

486
00:52:04,220 --> 00:52:11,730
how He is bothered about you – this is what
you must have first.

487
00:52:11,730 --> 00:52:17,480
I would say if you are hungry you’ll say,
“All right Mother, if You have done the

488
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,690
cooking let me have the food.” But if you
are not, then you would like to know this

489
00:52:22,690 --> 00:52:33,330
way, that way – what’s the use? Better
have the taste of it and then you will know

490
00:52:33,330 --> 00:52:39,370
each and everything. You will know the people
who have been realized souls before, what

491
00:52:39,370 --> 00:52:48,190
they talked, explanation of everything. Without
that you don’t have the subtle eyes, the

492
00:52:48,190 --> 00:52:56,710
sukshma to see the subtleties of what they
said. So, best thing is to get that light

493
00:52:56,710 --> 00:53:03,869
into your eyes, all right? So let us now stop
the questioning – it’s nine o’clock

494
00:53:03,869 --> 00:53:11,710
and it’s better to have it because you didn’t
know how the time was passing and the Realization

495
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:16,869
has to be done and I would like to meet all
of you. If you give Me time I would like to

496
00:53:16,869 --> 00:53:24,590
meet you, but in case if we spend our time
in only questioning, how can I meet you?

497
00:53:24,590 --> 00:53:25,650
REALISATION:

498
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:33,850
A few things have to be done, very simple.
Those who don’t want to do it can go. You

499
00:53:33,850 --> 00:53:42,590
cannot force on them. It has to be done in
your own freedom and glory. And if you don’t

500
00:53:42,590 --> 00:53:50,140
want to have it’s your own choice. Nothing
can be forced, this is a divine blessing which

501
00:53:50,140 --> 00:53:58,830
has to be asked for. As Christ has said, we
have to knock – in the same way. So it works

502
00:53:58,830 --> 00:54:04,810
on the principle that we are all computers
and you have to ask a question to a computer

503
00:54:04,810 --> 00:54:12,890
like Me and then you get the answers as the
Kundalini awakening – to explain it more

504
00:54:12,890 --> 00:54:21,220
sort of in a scientific thing. But it is a
very simple method that we have to take and

505
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:27,920
you have to help your centers also. As it
is it works spontaneously, no doubt, but if

506
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:35,859
we can little bit help our centers it expedites
and later on, if you go home, you can also

507
00:54:35,859 --> 00:54:40,710
work it out yourself. It’s a very simple
thing is – I don’t know how far he has

508
00:54:40,710 --> 00:54:47,040
told you about the channels, but the left
side represents your emotional side and your

509
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:55,970
desire to get Realization. And the right side
is the action that you have to take. So first

510
00:54:55,970 --> 00:55:03,180
of all we have to take the help of the Mother
Earth, and also the shoes sometimes block

511
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:10,180
the awakening, so it’s better to take out
the shoes for a while, just for a short time.

512
00:55:10,180 --> 00:55:15,010
It will hardly take ten minutes, hardly ten
minutes.

513
00:55:15,010 --> 00:55:25,890
Put both the feet on the ground parallel to
each other, just parallel to each other and

514
00:55:25,890 --> 00:55:31,250
you have to be comfortable. You have to be
comfortable, if there is something you find

515
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:39,310
rather tight on your body you can little bit
release the tightness and be comfortable.

516
00:55:39,310 --> 00:55:45,630
If somebody wants to go out for a while can
go and come back. This - I’ll wait for them

517
00:55:45,630 --> 00:55:52,270
in case because it is something that has to
work out, it has to work out and I am sure

518
00:55:52,270 --> 00:56:41,170
it will.

519
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:52,450
Now one has to know that Realization is not
complete unless and until your connection

520
00:56:52,450 --> 00:57:03,290
is established. So maybe today it will break
through in My presence – but you have to

521
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:12,370
establish and you have to know all about it
because the light which is enlightened has

522
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:19,849
to give light to others, must give light to
others, it’s very simple.

523
00:57:19,849 --> 00:57:25,330
Now I’m coming to Toronto, I was told after
six years. Of course next year I’m going

524
00:57:25,330 --> 00:57:32,390
to come definitely, no doubt, but still it
is you who are going to give Realization to

525
00:57:32,390 --> 00:57:40,170
others, it is you who are going to transform
the people here – it’s your responsibility.

526
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:47,490
There’s no commitment of money, there’s
no commitment of anything whatsoever – except

527
00:57:47,490 --> 00:57:54,090
that the commitment that we have got the light
and we have to give and once you start giving

528
00:57:54,090 --> 00:58:01,710
others you’ll be surprised that your spiritual
growth will be very fast. But if you do not

529
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:07,800
give to others you will be [stranded ?] and
you will not know why it is happening.

530
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:14,890
Second thing is very simple about modern Sahaja
Yoga we should say that first you get your

531
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:21,990
Realization, first you get a little light
within yourself and in that light you see

532
00:58:21,990 --> 00:58:27,530
what’s wrong with you and you yourself drop
it. Say people have given up drugs – I have

533
00:58:27,530 --> 00:58:34,050
not told them, they have given up so many
things I’ve never told them, it just works

534
00:58:34,050 --> 00:58:42,210
because your own Kundalini works it out and
grants these blessings to you. But you must

535
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:51,040
show full respect to your Self Realization
and you must show that gratitude of Divine

536
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:54,530
that you are going to spread it.

537
00:58:54,530 --> 00:59:01,830
We talk about so many things, disastrous things
but how much we can contribute by Realization

538
00:59:01,830 --> 00:59:10,570
you do not know. As soon as you will start
using your vibrations for giving Realizations

539
00:59:10,570 --> 00:59:18,080
to other people and meeting collectively,
understanding it - you’ll be amazed, the

540
00:59:18,080 --> 00:59:21,290
whole atmosphere will start changing.

541
00:59:21,290 --> 00:59:31,280
I didn’t tell you how much these vibrations
help for health but also for all the agriculture,

542
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:38,760
animals, everything. It’s such a wonderful
thing that three doctors in Delhi have got

543
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:50,090
their MD who have done research on three subjects
– one is the physical fitness, second is

544
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:58,230
the epilepsy and third psychosomatic diseases.
In Delhi-University they have done it.

545
00:59:58,230 --> 01:00:04,250
Now there are seven doctors in London who
are doing – not, it’s not research but

546
01:00:04,250 --> 01:00:11,330
recording how many people are cured by Sahaja
Yoga. We have definitely cured the disease

547
01:00:11,330 --> 01:00:15,500
you are talking about, definitely! And many
people have been cured.

548
01:00:15,500 --> 01:00:24,810
There is an architect who was described as
dead – that, I mean doctors had certified

549
01:00:24,810 --> 01:00:31,150
that you are going to die within one month’s
time, and he was saved by an English Sahaja

550
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:37,150
Yogini. She saved him just by telling him
how to meditate.

551
01:00:37,150 --> 01:00:43,890
So one has to first get Realization and then
believe in yourself and then you’ll believe

552
01:00:43,890 --> 01:00:49,890
in Sahaja Yoga. There’s no blind faith needed,
you have to first experience. Once you have

553
01:00:49,890 --> 01:00:56,890
the experience then yourself being honest,
you will do it. So actually I’m fulfilling

554
01:00:56,890 --> 01:01:03,270
all the prophecies of all the saints, all
the desires of all the prophets and all that

555
01:01:03,270 --> 01:01:10,599
was asked for – that’s a very difficult
task. It needs lot of patience, understanding

556
01:01:10,599 --> 01:01:18,000
and love. You see it’s easy to get crucified,
I tell you, even easier to take some poison

557
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:26,960
and to take some Samadhi, but to work it out,
day in and day out – it’s a difficult

558
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:32,600
task and you really need a Mother. If it was
a Krishna, He would have used his sudarshana

559
01:01:32,600 --> 01:01:39,560
chakra and Rama would have taken his [vanvyasa
?]. But I have to live with you, I have to

560
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:48,070
deal with you and I have to work it out and
My love has such a force that it doesn’t

561
01:01:48,070 --> 01:01:55,790
get tired, it doesn’t get tired at all.
I wish you all love yourself the same way

562
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:58,470
and understand your own glory.

563
01:01:58,470 --> 01:02:06,660
At the very outset we have to understand not
to feel guilty at all about anything whatsoever,

564
01:02:06,660 --> 01:02:13,090
because you forget your past. Not to feel
guilty. You are not to say that you have done

565
01:02:13,090 --> 01:02:19,940
this wrong, that wrong, not to count any mistakes.
After all you are human beings and only human

566
01:02:19,940 --> 01:02:25,290
beings can make mistakes. You are not God!
So there is nothing to condemn yourself for

567
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:31,180
anything, because now if you have to enter
into the kingdom of God why should you condemn

568
01:02:31,180 --> 01:02:39,760
yourself? You should be in a very pleasant
mood towards yourself, very pleasantly placed

569
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:45,420
and know that you are a human being and a
little journey has to be done. It’s very

570
01:02:45,420 --> 01:02:51,820
simple, I really tell you it’s very simple,
so do not go into any depression. Or some

571
01:02:51,820 --> 01:02:56,700
people also feel all the time, “Will I get
it or not?” You will all get it, I tell

572
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:04,770
you, I verily say you’ll all get it, but
don’t be diffident about it. With this let

573
01:03:04,770 --> 01:03:05,770
us start now.

574
01:03:05,770 --> 01:03:09,920
I’ll tell you, you put your left hand towards
Me like this to begin with, later on we’ll

575
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:16,490
go into a real awakening but just now I’ll
tell you how to do it. Left hand towards Me,

576
01:03:16,490 --> 01:03:22,000
symbolically you are expressing your desire
that you want to have your Self Realization.

577
01:03:22,000 --> 01:03:29,840
Then your right hand you put it on your heart,
which is a center where resides the Spirit.

578
01:03:29,840 --> 01:03:38,040
In human beings it resides in the heart, so
first we put it in the heart. Then we put

579
01:03:38,040 --> 01:03:43,880
our hand on the upper part of our abdomen
on the left-hand side. We work out everything

580
01:03:43,880 --> 01:03:51,400
on the left-hand side. Now here is the center
of your mastery, which is created by all the

581
01:03:51,400 --> 01:03:59,150
prophets and all the masters for us. So here
you place it in the upper part of your abdomen

582
01:03:59,150 --> 01:04:05,890
on the left-hand side. Then you place it in
the lower part of your abdomen, in the lower

583
01:04:05,890 --> 01:04:11,430
part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.
This is a very important center because this

584
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:19,590
is the center which manifests true knowledge
on your nervous system. So this is also a

585
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:27,560
very important center. Then you raise your
Kundalini by putting your hand on, again on

586
01:04:27,560 --> 01:04:34,450
the center of the master that is the upper
part of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

587
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:35,770
Press it hard.

588
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:46,510
Now. Then you press again your hand on your
heart. Now, you take your hand and put it

589
01:04:46,510 --> 01:04:55,450
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder
and turn your head to your right. This is

590
01:04:55,450 --> 01:05:02,120
the center you catch when you feel guilty.
You feel diffident and you try to debase yourself,

591
01:05:02,120 --> 01:05:09,780
this is the center you catch. So you put your
hand to your right, your hand on the left

592
01:05:09,780 --> 01:05:14,170
side but your head to your right.

593
01:05:14,170 --> 01:05:25,000
Now, stretch your hand and put the center
of your palm on - I’m sorry, then you have

594
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:39,230
to put your hand on the forehead, across.
Now this is the center – and bend your head

595
01:05:39,230 --> 01:05:51,460
- where you have to ask for forgiveness for
others, means you have to say, “I forgive

596
01:05:51,460 --> 01:05:58,760
everyone.” Now some will say that it’s
very difficult to forgive, but whether you

597
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:07,150
forgive or you don’t forgive, it’s a myth.
So, if you don’t forgive then you play into

598
01:06:07,150 --> 01:06:13,600
wrong hands. So better is to forgive. I find
it’s very difficult for people to forgive

599
01:06:13,600 --> 01:06:18,940
others, even to say that and then, when they
come to Me I find they have not forgiven and

600
01:06:18,940 --> 01:06:23,470
they have not felt the vibrations. So from
your heart you have to forgive when I tell

601
01:06:23,470 --> 01:06:32,890
you. Now put your hand on the backside of
your head and push back your head on it. Here

602
01:06:32,890 --> 01:06:41,340
you have to ask for forgiveness from Divine,
without counting your mistakes, without feeling

603
01:06:41,340 --> 01:06:44,010
guilty, just for your satisfaction.

604
01:06:44,010 --> 01:06:50,710
Now you have to stretch your hand and put
the center of your palm on top of your head,

605
01:06:50,710 --> 01:06:57,680
bending your head, just here where there’s
a fontanel bone area which was a soft bone

606
01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:06,109
in your childhood. So put your right hand
on top of that and press it hard, pushing

607
01:07:06,109 --> 01:07:14,800
back your fingers and move your scalp clockwise
slowly. Seven times you have to move, but

608
01:07:14,800 --> 01:07:25,020
that I’ll tell you later on after you close
your eyes, just now you move it seven times.

609
01:07:25,020 --> 01:07:42,109
Now you may have to close your eyes. Please
don’t open your eyes because there’s no

610
01:07:42,109 --> 01:07:49,720
mesmerism in it. Moreover your attention has
to be drawn inside, so it‘s better to close

611
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:57,490
your eyes, it will help you a lot, if you
keep your eyes closed till I tell you to open.

612
01:07:57,490 --> 01:08:04,420
Now please place your left hand towards Me,
and now close your eyes, keep your feet apart,

613
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:10,950
and put your right hand on your heart and
close your eyes. You can take out your spectacles

614
01:08:10,950 --> 01:08:18,230
also because it helps your eyesight.

615
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:24,529
Now when you have put your hand on your heart
you have to ask Me a very important question,

616
01:08:24,529 --> 01:08:29,839
you may call Me Shri Mataji, if you can, or
you can call Me Mother – whichever suits

617
01:08:29,839 --> 01:08:39,929
you, “Mother, am I the Spirit?” Ask this
question three times. In your heart ask the

618
01:08:39,929 --> 01:08:55,049
question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

619
01:08:55,049 --> 01:09:03,380
If you are the Spirit then you are your guide,
you are your master and all the prophets have

620
01:09:03,380 --> 01:09:10,520
built in a center in your being on the left-hand
side of your abdomen in the upper part. You

621
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:19,850
place your hand and press it hard and here
you ask Me another question three times, “Mother,

622
01:09:19,850 --> 01:09:34,849
am I 
my master? Mother, am I my guide?” Ask this

623
01:09:34,849 --> 01:09:47,929
question three times.

624
01:09:47,929 --> 01:10:07,219
Now please put your right hand in the lower
part of your abdomen, on the left-hand side.

625
01:10:07,219 --> 01:10:15,229
As I told you this is the center of pure knowledge
which manifests on your central nervous system,

626
01:10:15,229 --> 01:10:29,989
but I cannot force on you. You are free to
choose. I respect your freedom, so unless

627
01:10:29,989 --> 01:10:38,590
and until you ask Me I cannot bestow anything
like that or force you to accept anything.

628
01:10:38,590 --> 01:10:56,940
So you have to say, ”Mother, please give
me pure knowledge.” Please say it six times,

629
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:03,179
because this center has got six petals.

630
01:11:03,179 --> 01:11:17,139
When you ask for pure knowledge the Kundalini
starts moving upward. So we have to open the

631
01:11:17,139 --> 01:11:31,170
upper centers with our self-confidence. Raise
your right hand in the upper part of the abdomen

632
01:11:31,170 --> 01:11:44,739
on the left-hand side and say with full confidence
in yourself ten times, “Mother, I am my

633
01:11:44,739 --> 01:11:56,070
own master.” Please say it ten times.

634
01:11:56,070 --> 01:12:16,590
Now the greatest truth about you is that you
are not this body, you are not this mind,

635
01:12:16,590 --> 01:12:26,539
you are not this intellect, you are not your
conditioning, you are not your emotions, you

636
01:12:26,539 --> 01:12:36,910
are not your ego but you are the Spirit. So
please raise your hand on your heart again

637
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:45,500
and say with full confidence twelve times,
“Mother, I am the Spirit.” Please say

638
01:12:45,500 --> 01:12:51,959
it twelve times without doubting yourself.
Please say it with full confidence twelve

639
01:12:51,959 --> 01:13:04,599
times, “Mother, I am the spirit”, which
you are.

640
01:13:04,599 --> 01:13:22,869
Now we have to know that the Divine is the
ocean of love and knowledge, it is the ocean

641
01:13:22,869 --> 01:13:32,310
of compassion and bliss, but above all it
is the ocean of forgiveness, and whatever

642
01:13:32,310 --> 01:13:43,010
mistakes we have committed can be easily dissolved
by that ocean. So we have to forgive ourselves

643
01:13:43,010 --> 01:13:55,010
and we have to put our hand in the corner
of our shoulder and our neck and turn our

644
01:13:55,010 --> 01:14:04,499
head to our right and here with full confidence
we have to say sixteen times, full confidence,

645
01:14:04,499 --> 01:14:10,719
“Mother, I am not guilty at all.” Please
say it with full confidence: You are not!

646
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:16,719
Let the Kundalini judge you, you don’t judge
yourself and condemn yourself. Now put your

647
01:14:16,719 --> 01:14:28,979
hand as far as you can, take it towards your
spinal cord and turn your head to your right.

648
01:14:28,979 --> 01:14:44,519
As I have told you that we have to forgive
everyone. You don’t have to remember whom

649
01:14:44,519 --> 01:14:50,590
you have to forgive, what they have done to
you, what is their mistake and why they have

650
01:14:50,590 --> 01:14:56,400
tortured you – nothing is to be remembered.
At this present moment we have to know that

651
01:14:56,400 --> 01:15:03,309
we have to forgive them and this is the greatest
weapon we have got, that we can forgive everyone

652
01:15:03,309 --> 01:15:09,289
by which we neutralize them completely. They
cannot be effective on us. And let the Divine

653
01:15:09,289 --> 01:15:15,620
look after them. So now here you put your
hand on your forehead across and bend your

654
01:15:15,620 --> 01:15:24,289
head and press it hard on both the sides.
Here you have to say from your heart, not

655
01:15:24,289 --> 01:15:31,459
how many times, “Mother I forgive everyone.”
Believe Me – only saying this from your

656
01:15:31,459 --> 01:15:44,729
heart you’ll feel very much relieved, very
much relieved. Please say that, “Mother,

657
01:15:44,729 --> 01:15:48,539
I forgive everyone.”

658
01:15:48,539 --> 01:15:57,320
Now take back your hand, put it on the back
side of your head, what you call as the [optical

659
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:04,479
?] area and push your head on top of it and
let it rest on it and here you have to say

660
01:16:04,479 --> 01:16:14,519
without thinking about your guilt, your mistakes,
on anything, just for your satisfaction you

661
01:16:14,519 --> 01:16:20,809
have to say, “Oh Divine, if we have done
any mistakes, if I have done any mistakes,

662
01:16:20,809 --> 01:16:36,710
please forgive Me.” Is for your satisfaction,
but please do not try to find false with yourself.

663
01:16:36,710 --> 01:16:48,070
Now stretch your hand, and the center of your
hand please put it on to the soft bone that

664
01:16:48,070 --> 01:16:56,659
was in your childhood called as fontanel bone
area and press it hard, bending your head,

665
01:16:56,659 --> 01:17:04,310
push back your fingers. And now you have to
move it seven times, very slowly clockwise.

666
01:17:04,310 --> 01:17:13,459
But before that I’m sorry that I cannot
cross your freedom. In your freedom you have

667
01:17:13,459 --> 01:17:19,260
to ask for your Self Realization. It cannot
be forced, it’s too precious to be forced

668
01:17:19,260 --> 01:17:27,250
on anyone, so you have to say that, “Mother,
please give me my Self Realization.” And

669
01:17:27,250 --> 01:19:46,849
move it seven times slowly clockwise, pressing

670
01:19:46,849 --> 01:21:43,099
it 

671
01:21:43,099 --> 01:22:55,939
very hard, pushing back 

672
01:22:55,939 --> 01:28:00,349
your fingers, slowly, very slowly – please
do it.
