00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:05.328
Evening Program, Eve of Shri Hamsa Swamini Puja
Germany 9-7-1988

01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:15.640
After this grand manifestation

01:46:15.840 --> 01:46:19.640
of beautiful notes

01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:24.080
into such a beautiful woven melody,

01:46:24.280 --> 01:46:30.360
with all the permutations and combinations that are possible.

01:46:32.640 --> 01:46:38.960
It's hard to say anything any  more about it.

01:46:39.240 --> 01:46:42.040
I didn't know that such a great artist was there,

01:46:42.240 --> 01:46:43.760
I never heard him before.

01:46:43.960 --> 01:46:46.960
It's My luck today that I've been able to hear him

01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:50.560
and such a great artist on table.

01:46:50.720 --> 01:46:53.320
Is thanks to you that I could hear all this,

01:46:53.520 --> 01:46:58.720
they never get a chance to listen to such divine music.

01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:04.280
Is so beautiful and the ripples after ripples

01:47:04.480 --> 01:47:06.960
you could see how it was moving.

01:47:07.200 --> 01:47:09.840
I'm sorry I had to stop you from clapping, because

01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:13.840
that would have disturbed the ripples a little bit, I thought.

01:47:14.040 --> 01:47:19.040
But still it is to be understood that,

01:47:19.280 --> 01:47:25.680
indian music comes from the source which we call as OM.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:32.720
Is a divine source and all made congenial

01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:35.640
to the tuning of the Spirit.

01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:41.800
Because of that you all are feeling that joy within yourself.

01:47:41.960 --> 01:47:46.240
This joy that is created within yourdelf,

01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:50.560
maybe, that many musicians may not feel it.

01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:53.400
If they haven't felt their Spirit.

01:47:53.600 --> 01:47:57.720
Is for the saints to listen to this music.

01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:02.000
And for this great artists I am creating saints here,

01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:05.360
that they should appreciate

01:48:05.560 --> 01:48:10.200
this great music of india.

01:48:10.400 --> 01:48:16.560
Moreover I don't know how many of you have visited Kashmir,

01:48:16.760 --> 01:48:19.320
but the valleys of Kashmir,

01:48:19.520 --> 01:48:24.120
and the river Ganges flowing in it,

01:48:24.320 --> 01:48:28.000
as if, such a combination I have felt.

01:48:28.240 --> 01:48:33.160
As if the river Ganges was flowing

01:48:33.360 --> 01:48:36.200
in the Kashmir valleys,

01:48:36.400 --> 01:48:42.400
with all it's ripples and beauties the vibrations spreading.

01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:46.480
But the poetry fails, the words fail.

01:48:46.680 --> 01:48:52.840
The joy is so boundless and beautyful,

01:48:53.040 --> 01:48:57.320
is the expression of an artist,

01:48:57.560 --> 01:49:02.400
but in thoughtless awareness, in that Nirvichara Samadhi,

01:49:02.600 --> 01:49:06.440
you can enjoy it so much better.

01:49:06.600 --> 01:49:10.040
I was happy when the music went on

01:49:10.240 --> 01:49:13.560
during the time when there was not light.

01:49:13.800 --> 01:49:15.840
But I know all of you were hearing it

01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:19.640
through your Saharara, isn't it true? Yes Shri Mataji.

01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:22.680
And I'm happy that the artist didn't get disturbed,

01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.240
he went on playing.

01:49:24.360 --> 01:49:27.320
That's the best thing that can happen to us

01:49:27.520 --> 01:49:31.120
that we hear all these things trough our Sahasrara.

01:49:31.320 --> 01:49:36.360
So that

01:49:36.520 --> 01:49:40.520
the manifestation of that music

01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:45.080
is heard at a level,

01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:52.000
when you are on a very deep understanding.

01:49:52.200 --> 01:49:57.280
When you are very receptive.

01:49:57.480 --> 01:50:01.800
All this acts to our joy

01:50:02.000 --> 01:50:05.080
but also to our ascent.

01:50:05.280 --> 01:50:09.400
And may God bless all these artists,

01:50:09.600 --> 01:50:12.200
all of them, from My heart I bless them.

01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:16.320
So that they should prosper more and more.

01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:21.160
[HINDI]

01:50:21.360 --> 01:50:27.600
It is a very very special type of a instrument, I think.

01:50:27.800 --> 01:50:30.920
Is a very collective instrument,

01:50:31.120 --> 01:50:34.000
it has got hundred strings in it.

01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:37.120
But see the way the artist was playing,

01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:40.120
with different rhythms in both the hands.

01:50:40.320 --> 01:50:44.400
See, on one side if it was fast the another side it was slow.

01:50:44.600 --> 01:50:48.440
Sometimes, if you have noticed, he used to go off beat

01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:52.200
with one side, with the another side he was keeping the beat.

01:50:52.400 --> 01:50:57.560
It's a very beautiful rendering

01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:04.240
and extremely well balanced expression of a melody.

01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:09.560
I think there are no words to explain,

01:51:09.760 --> 01:51:14.680
how people are so dedicated to music in india.

01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:17.400
And with what concentration they learn it.

01:51:17.600 --> 01:51:22.320
And the alertness was so evident.

01:51:22.560 --> 01:51:27.600
The best part was the report between the tabla and the santoor,

01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:31.160
was so beautiful,

01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:35.320
so complementry, absolutely balanced.

01:51:35.520 --> 01:51:37.960
And we really have to thank them very much,

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:40.080
to come all the way to this place

01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:42.160
and to give you such beautiful music.

01:51:42.360 --> 01:51:45.720
I don't think I could have done that in London so much better.

01:51:45.920 --> 01:51:47.280
May God bless you.

01:51:47.800 --> 01:51:48.800
[Applause]

01:52:17.960 --> 01:52:22.400
[Musician] Well Shri Mataji said so many things.

01:52:23.640 --> 01:52:30.880
She told,

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.800
She said about us that we are [...]

01:52:33.960 --> 01:52:40.880
But I feel still we are just very small flies on there.

01:52:41.600 --> 01:52:44.440
We have a [...] some

01:52:44.680 --> 01:52:50.160
lot more in in the life and in music.

01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:58.960
God is great, my gurus they are great.

01:53:00.960 --> 01:53:05.080
And well, i don't know what i can to say more.

01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:11.560
Well, i think you understand what i mean.

01:53:11.680 --> 01:53:13.600
[Applause]

01:53:27.160 --> 01:53:31.040
Well it's really a very very

01:53:31.240 --> 01:53:37.280
deep happiness and pleasure for us

01:53:37.480 --> 01:53:41.840
to play all the time for all of you.

01:53:42.040 --> 01:53:49.400
Because we all we can go with the music and we can reach

01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:55.320
in, in the very God, to the God I mean.

01:53:58.080 --> 01:54:02.120
I think you like to listen till more, isn't it?

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:07.840
[Shri Mataji] [Hindi]

01:54:08.040 --> 01:54:12.880
[Shri Mataji] [Hindi]

01:54:13.080 --> 01:54:19.240
So i will take some time to tune the instrument.

01:54:19.440 --> 01:54:24.480
So we all can tune together with the instrument.

01:54:24.680 --> 01:54:25.880
And then i will continue.

01:54:26.080 --> 01:54:30.920
[Shri Mataji HINDI]

02:04:29.040 --> 02:04:33.960
Now this raag which i'm going to play

02:04:34.200 --> 02:04:38.880
is a very beautiful raag.

02:04:39.080 --> 02:04:43.000
All the raags they are beautiful.

02:04:46.560 --> 02:04:52.920
But this is more beautiful, because generally in India

02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:56.720
we play this raag at the end of the concert.

02:04:59.280 --> 02:05:02.360
[Shri Mataji HINDI] Bhairavi.

02:05:02.520 --> 02:05:07.960
Well, now you know that.

02:05:08.200 --> 02:05:12.920
So because of that it's very beautiful raag.

02:05:15.640 --> 02:05:21.720
And you know also the mood of the raag.

02:05:21.920 --> 02:05:26.640
So i shall play short alaap

02:05:26.840 --> 02:05:30.880
and then both the compositions

02:05:31.080 --> 02:05:35.920
in rhythmic cycle of 16 beats.

02:05:39.400 --> 02:05:45.800
I want to, i would like to tell you one small little thing,

02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:53.560
because it's very unusual here in Europe to tune the instrument.

02:05:53.760 --> 02:05:57.360
at the stage, sitting on the stage.

02:05:58.720 --> 02:06:01.800
But our big gurus they say,

02:06:02.000 --> 02:06:07.800
when you tune the instrument on the stage that means,

02:06:07.960 --> 02:06:12.880
we all we are tuning our hearts together.

02:06:13.120 --> 02:06:19.080
So when the instrument is tuned properly, so i'm tuned properly,

02:06:19.280 --> 02:06:23.960
and when i'm tuned properly, we all are tuned properly.

02:06:24.160 --> 02:06:26.760
So that's it.

02:06:28.640 --> 02:06:32.040
Well, i will play now, thank you.

02:06:32.200 --> 02:06:33.200
[Applause] Raag bhairavi.

02:30:53.080 --> 02:30:57.520
End of  Raag bhairavi. [Applause]

02:32:07.920 --> 02:32:10.960
[Shri Mataji] talking to/with the musicians [Mix Hindi/English]

02:41:29.720 --> 02:41:34.760
May God bless you. May God bless you all.

02:41:36.000 --> 02:41:39.720
[Shri Mataji leaving talking Hindi]
