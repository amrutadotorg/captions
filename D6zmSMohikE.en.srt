1
00:00:08,587 --> 00:00:13,660
So the value (of things) is not money

2
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:17,020
this one should understand.

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,860
What is the value of the thing?

4
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:26,503
You want to give something to others,

5
00:00:26,703 --> 00:00:32,900
then the feelings you have in your heart is the value,

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:36,940
and that value is the real Lakshmi.

7
00:00:40,443 --> 00:00:45,483
When you are, say, building a house,

8
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,780
the plans you make and things you do,

9
00:00:52,383 --> 00:00:55,256
what is the idea behind

10
00:00:55,456 --> 00:01:01,411
and what you are trying to express through that house

11
00:01:01,611 --> 00:01:04,971
is the value of that house.

12
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,860
Once you understand that you have to buy,

13
00:01:13,515 --> 00:01:18,340
with this Lakshmi, or you have to use this Lakshmi

14
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:26,120
for certain value, and not for showing off or for money.

15
00:01:29,123 --> 00:01:33,838
This superficialness that we have about money

16
00:01:34,038 --> 00:01:38,778
itself is like an ordinary glass,

17
00:01:38,978 --> 00:01:44,507
but if you put behind the glass the mercury,

18
00:01:44,707 --> 00:01:48,107
you can see the value.

19
00:01:49,203 --> 00:01:56,443
So when you start buying something, what is the purpose,

20
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:58,667
why are you buying it

21
00:01:58,867 --> 00:02:01,827
this will determine the value.

22
00:02:02,587 --> 00:02:06,253
Like, last time I came to Portugal

23
00:02:06,453 --> 00:02:11,494
and I said, "This year we'll go and buy some Terracotta"

24
00:02:11,694 --> 00:02:13,846
but they are very expensive.

25
00:02:14,046 --> 00:02:17,206
I said, "This is the price",

26
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:20,460
but I wanted to buy Terracotta from Portugal,

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:22,875
because it's very rich in that.

28
00:02:23,075 --> 00:02:29,394
So we went to one factory, and the factory was quite far out,

29
00:02:29,594 --> 00:02:31,605
none of them could find out, but I told them,

30
00:02:31,805 --> 00:02:34,551
"It's here only just go and see."

31
00:02:35,416 --> 00:02:38,635
And then we bought the Terracotta.

32
00:02:38,835 --> 00:02:42,081
But on our way I told,

33
00:02:42,822 --> 00:02:46,065
"Stop, stop here, stop."

34
00:02:46,371 --> 00:02:49,147
So they stopped, there was a shop.

35
00:02:49,347 --> 00:02:54,248
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis in India

36
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:58,450
and also for some people in Cabella.

37
00:02:58,650 --> 00:03:02,706
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.

38
00:03:03,380 --> 00:03:06,260
They were Sahaja Yogis from here who saw it

39
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,171
such beautiful clothes and I bought lot of it

40
00:03:11,371 --> 00:03:17,571
I said, "Thank God the problem presents are finished now for India."

41
00:03:18,003 --> 00:03:21,587
So joy-giving it was, everybody was surprised

42
00:03:21,787 --> 00:03:25,531
why, suddenly in a place where never had been Mother there,

43
00:03:25,731 --> 00:03:29,051
suddenly She finds them.

44
00:03:29,867 --> 00:03:35,291
It has a value, because I wanted to buy something for Indians

45
00:03:35,491 --> 00:03:38,051
to be given as present.

46
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:44,035
So if your Lakshmi is, say, this much,

47
00:03:44,235 --> 00:03:49,061
once you add to it value it becomes so big.

48
00:03:51,084 --> 00:03:56,793
The sign of a person who is Lakshmipathi is this

49
00:03:56,993 --> 00:04:02,387
he should have a house like the lotus in the hands

50
00:04:02,587 --> 00:04:05,899
of the Goddess,

51
00:04:06,099 --> 00:04:10,578
he should protect people who are depending on him,

52
00:04:10,778 --> 00:04:15,362
and from the left hand he should give.

53
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:20,494
This is the image of the Lakshmi.

54
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,300
This is what the Lakshmi is within you,

55
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:29,380
if you have these four things things in balance,

56
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:32,420
without conditioning, without ego,

57
00:04:32,620 --> 00:04:35,670
then you are a Sahaja Yogi

58
00:04:35,871 --> 00:04:38,646
Otherwise you are not.

59
00:04:40,235 --> 00:04:44,792
On a Diwali day we have to promise ourselves

60
00:04:44,992 --> 00:04:50,660
that whatever we are going to get now as Lakshmi principle

61
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,003
or as a Lakshmi's prasad

62
00:04:54,203 --> 00:05:01,843
should be used in getting thing which has value.

63
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:12,187
And thus you will learn that you have used your Lakshmi very well,

64
00:05:12,387 --> 00:05:18,052
and with that your Mahalakshmi principle becomes very strong.

65
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:22,820
Will become very strong by which you'll ascend very fast.
