WEBVTT

01:35.200 --> 01:42.200
With love

04:21.989 --> 04:28.989
all kinds of creative action takes place.
You see how Raulbai has love for Me and in

04:32.090 --> 04:39.090
this place you all also got new idea of creating
a beautiful thing. And as love will increase,

04:43.770 --> 04:47.250
your creativity will develop.

04:47.250 --> 04:54.250
So the basis of all creativity, of Saraswati,
is love. If there is no love there’s no

04:57.280 --> 05:04.280
creativity. It’s even in the deeper sense,
you see. People who have created all the scientific

05:06.060 --> 05:12.010
things are also out of love for the masses,
not for themselves. Nobody has produced anything

05:12.010 --> 05:17.780
for themselves. If they make something for
themselves it has to become for universal

05:17.780 --> 05:22.510
use, otherwise it has no meaning. Even if
you say atom bomb and all these things that

05:22.510 --> 05:28.570
are created from science, they are also very
protective. If they had not created those,

05:28.570 --> 05:34.289
people would not have taken out their minds
from war. Now, nobody can think of having

05:34.289 --> 05:40.560
a big war. Of course, they are having cold
wars, but that also will gradually stop, when

05:40.560 --> 05:42.409
they will be fed up.

05:42.409 --> 05:48.680
So, all the activity on the right hand side,
of Saraswati, basically has to end up in love.

05:48.680 --> 05:54.169
Starts with love and ends up in love. Whichever
does not end up in love coils up and finishes

05:54.169 --> 06:01.169
off. It just disappears. So you can see that
even matter, which is not used for love, just

06:04.000 --> 06:11.000
finishes off. The basis has to be love. Otherwise
all such matter that we create which has angularity,

06:12.580 --> 06:19.580
which is not fitting into the mass media which
is not appealing to the masses. Of course,

06:20.510 --> 06:27.510
it takes time, you have seen that it takes
time - but it does have that tendency always

06:28.000 --> 06:32.599
to disappear in the thin air as soon as you
find it does not appeal to the masses.

06:32.599 --> 06:39.599
Now this love of, that we talk of, this great
love of God we talk of, we know it for definite

06:41.810 --> 06:48.810
through vibrations. People do not have vibrations,
but still they can feel the vibrations in

06:50.140 --> 06:55.349
a very unconscious way. All the great paintings
of the world have vibrations. All the great

06:55.349 --> 07:01.510
creative works of the world have vibrations.
Only those who have vibrations have been sustained

07:01.510 --> 07:06.940
by time, otherwise all other things are destroyed.
There must have been monuments and horrible

07:06.940 --> 07:12.830
statues and horrible things that have been
created long time back. But they were all

07:12.830 --> 07:19.830
destroyed by nature, and they could not stand
the impact of the Kala - that is the destructive

07:21.339 --> 07:28.339
power of time. So, all that is sustaining,
all that is nurturing, all that is en-nobling,

07:31.140 --> 07:38.130
comes from this sense of love, which is within
us very much developed, but within others

07:38.130 --> 07:44.990
also, who are not yet realized. Ultimately
the whole world has to realize that one has

07:44.990 --> 07:50.140
to go to that ultimate love of God, otherwise
it has no meaning.

07:50.140 --> 07:55.990
Now you have seen in art people have taken
to other methods of appealing to people by

07:55.990 --> 08:01.820
using cheap things and very vulgar things,
just to make people think that this is art.

08:01.820 --> 08:08.820
But this will all disappear. It cannot sustain
the impact of the time as I told you, it cannot.

08:08.990 --> 08:13.729
Because the time will kill it. All these things
have to disappear and already you can see

08:13.729 --> 08:18.779
the result, how things are changing everywhere,
even in the West. So there is no need to be

08:18.779 --> 08:24.450
so much disappointed with the West and to
say that the Western world is a wasteland.

08:24.450 --> 08:30.589
It is going to be alright and it has to be
done. Especially it has done lot of Puja of

08:30.589 --> 08:35.919
Saraswati, I should say, in the West. Much
more than they have done in India because

08:35.919 --> 08:40.959
they have gone to learning and they have tried
to find out so many things. But only thing

08:40.959 --> 08:46.529
they forgot that it is a Goddess, Goddess
of Learning. Everything comes from the Goddess.

08:46.529 --> 08:50.170
That’s what they’ve forgotten. And that’'s
why all the problems have been created.

08:50.170 --> 08:55.220
If there is no Spirit in your learning, if
there is no source of the Goddess in your

08:55.220 --> 09:01.430
learning, then it is absolutely useless. If
they had realized that there is the Spirit

09:01.430 --> 09:08.250
that is working it out, they would not have
gone that far. And that’s what I was warning

09:08.250 --> 09:14.580
the Indians, all through, that you are now
taking to industrial revolution in a way and

09:14.580 --> 09:20.870
to avoid all the complications of industrial
revolution, you must try to know the Spirit.

09:20.870 --> 09:25.810
If you do not know the Spirit you will have
the same problems as these people have. Because

09:25.810 --> 09:30.760
they are also human beings, you are also human
beings. You will also go the same way. At

09:30.760 --> 09:36.950
random you will run and there will be problems,
the same problems as the Western people have.

09:36.950 --> 09:41.589
Now Saraswati's blessings are so many that
one cannot describe in such a short time.

09:41.589 --> 09:48.589
And the Surya has given us so many powers
that it is impossible to tell them even in

09:49.769 --> 09:56.769
one lecture, even in ten lectures. But how
we go against Surya and how we go against

09:57.730 --> 10:03.050
Saraswati, while doing the worship of Saraswati,
is to be seen very clearly within ourselves.

10:03.050 --> 10:09.740
For example the Western people are very fond
of Surya because they have no Surya. But they

10:09.740 --> 10:15.100
go too far with it, as you know, and create
complications within themselves of Surya.

10:15.100 --> 10:22.100
But the main thing that one has to achieve
through Surya is the light within, is the

10:27.260 --> 10:33.860
light within. And if Surya chakra at the Agnya
level is occupied by Lord Jesus Christ then

10:33.860 --> 10:40.860
it is even more essential that the purity
of life, what we call ‘Niti’, is the morality

10:46.800 --> 10:47.050
of life.

10:46.800 --> 10:53.390
Now morality itself has become very much sort
of an argument in the West. People don't have

10:53.390 --> 11:00.390
any sense of absolute morality. On vibrations
of course you know. But they have gone all

11:00.550 --> 11:07.550
against it. Those who are worshippers of Jesus,
those who are the worshippers of the Surya,

11:08.050 --> 11:15.050
of the Saraswati have all gone against it.
Against the powers of Surya, just disobeying

11:17.020 --> 11:24.020
it. Because you cannot be a Surya if you do
not have a proper sense of morality and holiness.

11:24.990 --> 11:31.710
The Surya itself brings light, to see everything
clearly.

11:31.710 --> 11:38.630
So many qualities Surya has got. It dries
up everything that is wet, dirty, filthy.

11:38.630 --> 11:45.630
It dries up all these places, which create
parasites. But so many parasites are created

11:47.370 --> 11:52.490
in the West. Not only parasites, but there
are horrible cults and horrible things which

11:52.490 --> 11:59.490
have come into those countries which are supposed
to be full of light, and in that darkness

12:01.970 --> 12:08.970
they exist. Darkness about their Spirit, darkness
about their own knowledge and darkness about

12:11.860 --> 12:18.190
love. These three things have taken over in
the places where you are supposed to love

12:18.190 --> 12:23.120
light. Light doesn’t mean, light doesn’t
mean what you see with your gross eyes. Light

12:23.120 --> 12:29.070
means from within - the Light of Love. That
one should understand – Light of Love. And

12:29.070 --> 12:36.070
it is so soothing, it’s so sweet, it’s
so beautiful, it’s so enamouring, it’s

12:37.480 --> 12:44.430
so abounding that unless and until you can
feel that light within you - that light which

12:44.430 --> 12:51.430
is of pure love of purity, pure relationships,
pure understanding. If you can develop that

12:52.630 --> 12:59.630
kind of a light within yourself, then the
whole thing will be cleansed. 'Wash me and

13:04.680 --> 13:11.380
I shall be whiter than snow.' This is what
happens to you when you are completely cleansed.

13:11.380 --> 13:18.380
The purest form of nature is within us. The
purest form of nature is within us. Our chakras

13:20.190 --> 13:27.190
are made out of that purest form of nature.
We are the only people who are spoiling it

13:30.550 --> 13:34.460
by our mental thinking, against the same Saraswati’s
power. You are going against Saraswati itself.

13:34.460 --> 13:41.460
Saraswati cleanses all that is impure in nature,
while, with our brain activity, we are spoiling

13:42.040 --> 13:49.040
all that. All our brain activity goes against
pure intelligence. And that’s what one has

13:51.670 --> 13:58.670
to understand - that this pure intelligence,
is not to be soiled by our thinking. Our thinking

13:58.690 --> 14:05.690
can make us so bumptious, so ego-oriented,
so impure, that, we can really eat the poison

14:11.910 --> 14:18.910
and say 'what is wrong with it'? Just the
opposite of Saraswati. If Saraswati is within

14:19.250 --> 14:25.750
us, She gives us Subuddhi, wisdom. And that
is why to worship Saraswati, to worship Surya;

14:25.750 --> 14:31.390
we must have that clear vision as to what
we have to be. What we are doing. What filth

14:31.390 --> 14:37.779
we are living in. What our mind is getting
into. After all we are here for emancipation

14:37.779 --> 14:43.160
and not for just for pampering our ego and
living with our filth that is with us. So

14:43.160 --> 14:50.160
this light has come within us and we should
try to rise above our own mental filth, which

14:51.339 --> 14:55.300
is being created around us.

14:55.300 --> 15:02.300
Apart from that, you have to go higher and
understand that there is, within us, a thing

15:04.130 --> 15:10.560
called ego. And this ego is false, absolutely
false. You do not do anything. Actually when

15:10.560 --> 15:16.850
you turn your eyes here and there, when your
attention is here and there it is nothing

15:16.850 --> 15:23.850
but your ego that is trying to overpower you.
But actually ego is an absolute falsehood

15:26.360 --> 15:31.660
because there is only one ego and that is
of God Almighty, Mahatahamkara.

15:31.660 --> 15:38.660
There is no really any ego that exists. It
is myth. It is a very big myth, because if

15:40.779 --> 15:44.820
you start thinking you are doing everything
- you are doing this, you are doing that - which

15:44.820 --> 15:51.320
you are not doing; then this nonsensical ego
comes in and you start working it out, it

15:51.320 --> 15:58.060
can project in every direction. When it projects
forward, it overpowers others, it tries to

15:58.060 --> 16:05.060
dominate others, tries to kill others, becomes
cruel. When it moves [to the] right side,

16:06.230 --> 16:12.240
it becomes supraconscious. It starts seeing
things, which are absurd, which are foolish,

16:12.240 --> 16:19.240
which are stupid. When it moves left side
then it starts talking - I mean, seeing things

16:20.860 --> 16:27.860
- yourself as a big man, as a big Christ or
as a big Devi or something like Adi Gurus

16:28.000 --> 16:30.850
and 'I am a very great personality' - that
is left sided. When it moves backwards, that

16:30.850 --> 16:33.220
is the dangerous one.

16:33.220 --> 16:40.220
When people become gurus, which are ruining
other people. When their ego moves backwards

16:41.890 --> 16:46.130
then they become gurus, they themselves have
lots of defects in themselves and they try

16:46.130 --> 16:53.130
to pull people into those horrible stuff,
which is described as absolute Naraka. That’s

16:53.149 --> 16:57.649
how, is the movement of ego on all the sides.

16:57.649 --> 17:04.649
Now when people try to use their right Vishuddhi
that is, to talk about themselves, is the

17:05.240 --> 17:11.380
worst of all. Whatever type of ego you may
have, if you start boasting about it and talking

17:11.380 --> 17:18.380
about it, then it encircles, thickens the
walls of ego so much, that it is impossible

17:19.750 --> 17:23.909
to penetrate into that. Because such a person
is completely satisfied with himself and he

17:23.909 --> 17:29.840
believes that he is so. And once he starts
believing into a nonsense like that, it's

17:29.840 --> 17:33.370
an impossibility, is an impossibility to penetrate.

17:33.370 --> 17:40.370
So, when you boast about these things or you
talk big, be careful. You see, you know what

17:45.250 --> 17:49.260
I am, but how many times do I say 'I am that'?
Even if I say once, it makes tremendous vibrations

17:49.260 --> 17:53.580
for you. But how many times do I say so? At
the most if you say something, I say 'yes'.

17:53.580 --> 17:59.730
But I don't say that. If I say it loudly,
I don't know what may happen. The whole thing

17:59.730 --> 18:06.730
might be blasted with that. So, one has to
understand that Mahatahamkara is the one that

18:06.860 --> 18:11.320
acts, that works, that creates. Sometimes
I shout at you. Immediately all the bhoots

18:11.320 --> 18:16.419
run away. Just once I shout. Yesterday, you
saw all the bhoots that were coughing, they

18:16.419 --> 18:20.760
all ran away. Yesterday just I started. So
you should understand that now you are a realized

18:20.760 --> 18:25.770
souls, you can also do the same. Use your
right Vishuddhi to shout at yourself, ‘‘Now

18:25.770 --> 18:30.760
will you please stop boasting, will you stop
talking all this nonsense, will you stop showing

18:30.760 --> 18:34.390
off!'' Then it will stop.

18:34.390 --> 18:41.390
Now this thickening takes place by people
who really are active. Who want to do something

18:43.340 --> 18:47.690
about it, not that they are not active. They
want to do it. But they know only one way,

18:47.690 --> 18:54.690
is to act talkative. They don't understand
that there are inner ways by which you control

18:55.659 --> 19:02.659
it much more. Because they don't want to take
to that, they take to this talking. And once

19:02.860 --> 19:09.860
they take to talking and they talk about it,
the whole power goes. But if they do not talk

19:13.600 --> 19:15.730
about it and keep it within themselves. It’s
alright, you can tell Me about your experiences

19:15.730 --> 19:20.059
or anything, but if you start telling others,
and talking about it too much, then the powers

19:20.059 --> 19:25.580
that you have got will all be disappearing
gradually. And you will just come down to

19:25.580 --> 19:30.799
absolutely lowest level. So one should not
too much talk that “I have this power, I

19:30.799 --> 19:33.730
have this power” or “I see this” or
“I do this,” which is a very wrong thing.

19:33.730 --> 19:37.460
I warn you, don’t try to show off.

19:37.460 --> 19:44.460
Yes, you can talk about My powers. It is all
right. But don't try to talk about your powers.

19:45.690 --> 19:50.830
When it comes, of course, to talk to somebody
who is a negative person or to tell somebody,

19:50.830 --> 19:57.830
then you should say that “we”, not “I”.
“We” have, some of us have felt this power

19:57.909 --> 20:02.369
within us. We have seen people”. It may
be you only, but you need not say, 'I' have.

20:02.369 --> 20:08.929
What you have to say is 'We'. Then you become
the Mahatahamkara. When you say 'We', Yes

20:08.929 --> 20:15.929
some of us', 'we do'. Like in Gregoire's book
also I made it, I saw to it, that he should

20:16.129 --> 20:23.129
not have many 'I's', but he should have 'We'.
'We think', 'we do', 'we'. Means, the whole

20:23.139 --> 20:28.499
collective being, the whole collective organism,
living organism of Sahaja Yogis. So if you

20:28.499 --> 20:33.299
say, 'yes, some of us have got it', that means,
you put yourself down, but put all others

20:33.299 --> 20:37.080
above you. Say: 'Yes, some of us have. I know
some people have this.'

20:37.080 --> 20:42.019
That’'s the way one should do it. Because
if you have to overpower your ego, you must

20:42.019 --> 20:48.559
allow it to spread into everybody else. That’s
how you will make it perfectly all right.

20:48.559 --> 20:49.190
Let it spread. “We, all Sahaja Yogis, we
all”.

20:49.190 --> 20:56.190
But that pride is not there. I've seen that
pride is not there. Still it is very individualistic.

20:57.720 --> 21:03.809
If you start thinking, ''we Sahaja Yogis",
then what happens, that you become one personality,

21:03.809 --> 21:04.419
one organization.

21:04.419 --> 21:10.239
But the person will look down upon other people.
He will see that this person is low, that

21:10.239 --> 21:16.299
person is higher, that person is there. But
he will not think 'We' the Sahaja Yogis, how

21:16.299 --> 21:23.070
beautiful we are. 'We' the body of Sahaja
Yoga, how beautiful we are. So always think

21:23.070 --> 21:30.070
in the words of 'we', so your ego will become
much less, much less, much less. And the same

21:34.590 --> 21:41.590
ego, which looked so funny and absurd, will
form tomorrow, the Ekadesha. Today’s, individual

21:44.830 --> 21:51.830
ego will merge into Ekadesha. But we all must
remember to say 'we' all time.

21:54.509 --> 22:00.570
This is what is today's day, is a great day
for us to change, because the sun has changed

22:00.570 --> 22:07.299
its mood, now. Sun is coming this side. So
let us welcome the Sun, coming to the North

22:07.299 --> 22:14.299
now, this way. And for Australians to say
that though the sun has gone, let us establish

22:14.879 --> 22:21.739
the Sun, the domain of Sun, within ourselves.
Because Sun never disappears from our inside.

22:21.739 --> 22:27.340
So that is how we have to take a mood by which
we should think of one personality, all of

22:27.340 --> 22:34.139
us together, all of us together. And anybody
who tries to be something separate or different,

22:34.139 --> 22:40.999
he will drop out. I will drop him out. Whatever
it may be, it will drop out. So you just don’t

22:40.999 --> 22:44.369
worry yourself, anybody who tries to be singled
out or anything.

22:44.369 --> 22:50.119
Everybody must do whatever they like, to nurture
the whole, to help the whole, to emancipate

22:50.119 --> 22:57.119
the whole. But not to, in anyway, put anyone
down. Always. Because this is not the way

22:58.649 --> 23:04.539
the Sahaja Yoga is. Sahaja Yoga only works
in collectivity. And the one who has developed

23:04.539 --> 23:08.480
this permeating spirit, is a real Sahaja Yogi.
Who has not, is not!

23:08.480 --> 23:15.480
Whatever you may think of yourself, I have
nothing to say. But this permeating personality,

23:15.940 --> 23:20.580
which moves from places to places, whether,
you talk or not. Like your Mother is. Whether

23:20.580 --> 23:25.629
I meet you or not, makes no difference, but
I am permeating through all of you, by little,

23:25.629 --> 23:31.220
little things, also, I am there with you.
So like that, try to permeate into each other

23:31.220 --> 23:36.369
and see the beauty. And you’ll enjoy yourself
the best because that is the biggest thing.

23:36.369 --> 23:42.379
That's the biggest thing that is to be achieved.
Because this ego you know makes you like a

23:42.379 --> 23:48.580
nutshell and you just cannot have a rapport
with that beauty of permeation and just see

23:48.580 --> 23:52.480
how the notes move into each other.

23:52.480 --> 23:59.480
It will be a great idea today, it’s great
thing today [that] we are having Puja in Dhulia.

23:59.519 --> 24:06.200
Like the Dhulia means the dust, dust. And
one day I had written in childhood, a poem,

24:06.200 --> 24:10.909
I remember. Very interesting poem it was - I
don't know where it is now - but which said

24:10.909 --> 24:17.909
that I want to be like a dust particle which
moves with the wind. It goes everywhere. Can

24:19.299 --> 24:25.509
go, sit on the head of a king, or can go and
fall at the feet of someone. And it can go

24:25.509 --> 24:32.509
and sit on a little flower, and it can go
and sit everywhere. But I want to be a particle

24:33.119 --> 24:39.359
of dust. That is fragrant, that is nourishing,
that is enlightening.

24:39.359 --> 24:44.850
Like that, I had written a very beautiful
poem, I must have been about seven years of

24:44.850 --> 24:50.869
age, I remember - 'To be a dust particle',
I remember that very clearly, long time back,

24:50.869 --> 24:57.869
that I should be a dust particle. So that
I’ll permeate into people. Which is a very

24:59.039 --> 25:04.739
big thing - to become a dust particle of that
kind. Whatever you touch, you see, that becomes

25:04.739 --> 25:06.999
{sounds like ‘enwavened’ but I don’t
think that’s a word – “enlightened”??},

25:06.999 --> 25:13.999
whatever you just feel, that has fragrance.
It’s such a great thing to be like that.

25:14.799 --> 25:21.799
And that was My desire, and it has been achieved.
At that young age, I had this idea of becoming

25:22.119 --> 25:28.279
a dust particle and today just while talking
to you, I remembered that I wanted to be that,

25:28.279 --> 25:30.879
and that is what this place is.

25:30.879 --> 25:37.049
And Raulbai is like that. She’s a very simple
woman, very simple woman, and she lives like

25:37.049 --> 25:44.049
a very simple person but she has a sense of
permeation. And now there are so many Sahaja

25:44.549 --> 25:48.200
Yogis, yesterday who came. I am sure that
they will take up, Sahaja Yoga, very well.

25:48.200 --> 25:55.200
And there are lots of Sahaja Yogis from Dhulia
now, and I am sure there are going to be more

25:55.460 --> 25:59.879
people. I hope you have met all of them. Make
friends with all of them. Try to know them

25:59.879 --> 26:04.859
who they are. They may not know English - so
get somebody to translate. Talk to them and

26:04.859 --> 26:09.779
be nice to them, be friendly with them. I
wanted you to meet them for permeation. You

26:09.779 --> 26:14.869
should know who are the people here, who are
in Nasik. Because somehow we never meet the

26:14.869 --> 26:19.460
Sahaja Yogis, you see, who are in that particular
place, and when we go back we have only one

26:19.460 --> 26:24.399
or two addresses. It is not a good idea. Try
to see how many people there are. Ask questions

26:24.399 --> 26:27.029
about them, and all that.

26:27.029 --> 26:32.789
This permeation is only possible when your
ego starts permeating all around, and this

26:32.789 --> 26:38.649
is the way to overcome the problems of the
right side and that is how to worship Saraswati.

26:38.649 --> 26:45.409
Because Saraswati has a Veena in Her hand
and that Veena is the primordial instrument,

26:45.409 --> 26:49.229
which She plays like music, and the smusic
penetrates into the heart. You don't know

26:49.229 --> 26:55.889
how it goes into you and how it works out.
And that’'s how a person who is a Sahaja

26:55.889 --> 26:59.979
Yogi should permeate - like music into other
people.

26:59.979 --> 27:04.059
She has so many qualities, as I told you,
which cannot be described in one lecture.

27:04.059 --> 27:11.059
But one of the greatest qualities of Hers
is that She ends up into subtler things. Like

27:13.389 --> 27:20.389
the Mother Earth will end up into fragrance.
Music will end up into melodies, like that

27:21.950 --> 27:28.029
whatever She creates ends up into something
greater. Matter, whatever She produces, ends

27:28.029 --> 27:34.489
up into aesthetics. If matter does not have
aesthetics then it is gross. Like that everything.

27:34.489 --> 27:38.559
Now you will say what is water. Water becomes
the river Ganges.

27:38.559 --> 27:45.559
These are the subtler things. So the matter
gets into subtler thing because it has to

27:46.869 --> 27:53.869
permeate, it has to permeate. So everything
whatever it is. And the best of all is the

27:54.210 --> 28:01.210
air. That air becomes the vibrations.

28:01.479 --> 28:08.479
So you can see how, whatever has come out
from

28:17.289 --> 28:24.289
this matter, from these five elements, becomes
that subtle thing. Of course, the left and

28:48.929 --> 28:55.929
right side both work it out because the love
has to work on this and when love acts on

29:18.359 --> 29:25.359
matter it becomes that, and

29:53.619 --> 30:00.619
that is how one has

39:26.539 --> 39:33.539
to look at your own lives, to make it

47:14.269 --> 47:21.269
a beautiful combination of

49:12.410 --> 49:19.410
love and matter.

55:39.569 --> 55:46.569
May

56:43.329 --> 56:50.329
God bless you!
