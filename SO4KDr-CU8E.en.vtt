WEBVTT

01:10.583 --> 01:16.250
Today we have come here

01:17.333 --> 01:22.208
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

01:24.750 --> 01:27.166
It's such a coincidence

01:27.166 --> 01:29.458
that the Mother of Christ

01:29.458 --> 01:32.166
came and stayed in Turkey.

01:32.875 --> 01:35.333
Isn't it surprising

01:35.375 --> 01:37.333
that She should come here

01:38.542 --> 01:43.041
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

01:43.458 --> 01:47.959
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

01:48.333 --> 01:50.709
But they say then He went to Kashmir

01:50.917 --> 01:52.834
and She was also there.

01:53.417 --> 01:56.083
Quite possible, on their way

01:56.250 --> 01:58.500
they might have gone there.

01:59.166 --> 02:04.834
So we are here to worship Him.

02:13.709 --> 02:15.250
According to Sahaja Yoga,

02:16.834 --> 02:19.542
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

02:21.291 --> 02:25.834
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

02:26.291 --> 02:31.250
for the sake of religion.

02:32.375 --> 02:35.250
But unfortunately,

02:35.583 --> 02:37.959
nobody understood Her value.

02:40.125 --> 02:42.041
Nobody saw

02:42.166 --> 02:47.375
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

02:47.875 --> 02:50.125
Only through Sahaja Yoga

02:50.625 --> 02:52.792
you can understand that She was

02:53.041 --> 02:55.834
a very great personality

02:56.083 --> 03:00.125
who gave birth to Christ.

03:05.709 --> 03:09.959
It is very unfortunate

03:11.375 --> 03:13.417
that She was not respected,

03:14.750 --> 03:18.166
specially in the Islamic world.

03:18.875 --> 03:20.083
Because of that,

03:20.959 --> 03:27.458
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

03:29.667 --> 03:34.250
My experience is very sad about them.

03:36.458 --> 03:38.750
We have started an organization

03:39.917 --> 03:42.250
for the rehabilitation of women

03:42.792 --> 03:46.417
who are destitutes and all of them

03:46.750 --> 03:51.208
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

03:52.959 --> 03:54.875
While Muhammed Sahib has said

03:54.875 --> 03:57.959
that "you must look after your mother"

03:58.709 --> 04:01.250
despite that all these women

04:01.834 --> 04:06.750
some of them have eight children, ten children

04:07.041 --> 04:09.792
- have come to this destitute home.

04:10.709 --> 04:13.750
Of course, we have to give them place.

04:13.792 --> 04:16.333
We have to look after them

04:16.333 --> 04:18.667
because we don't believe in all these

04:18.959 --> 04:23.750
small type of ideas about religion.

04:24.750 --> 04:27.667
Most important is 'human' religion.

04:29.709 --> 04:32.792
We have to combine all these religions together.

04:33.750 --> 04:36.333
It's a terrible task

04:36.959 --> 04:41.166
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

04:41.500 --> 04:44.625
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

04:44.834 --> 04:47.291
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

04:48.709 --> 04:50.583
They all are for God

04:51.417 --> 04:53.917
and for God's work and His love.

04:55.041 --> 04:57.625
Despite that, there's no respect.

04:58.417 --> 04:59.458
There's no love.

05:00.709 --> 05:03.166
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

05:03.333 --> 05:07.125
killing everywhere.

05:08.625 --> 05:09.667
It's very sad

05:10.875 --> 05:13.750
that in the name of religion and God,

05:14.041 --> 05:18.333
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

05:20.458 --> 05:21.792
This is the only solution-

05:23.750 --> 05:25.959
is to give them Self Realization,

05:27.458 --> 05:31.291
which is the Realization

05:31.583 --> 05:37.291
was called as miraj in the Koran.

05:37.500 --> 05:39.709
It's called as miraj.

05:39.750 --> 05:43.250
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

05:44.625 --> 05:47.250
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

05:47.709 --> 05:49.959
- like they have banned people

05:50.208 --> 05:52.083
from getting Self Realization,

05:52.583 --> 05:53.667
which is not true.

05:54.709 --> 05:59.000
All human beings can get Self Realization.

06:00.250 --> 06:04.166
Whether they are from Africa,

06:04.959 --> 06:08.417
England, America, India, anywhere.

06:09.792 --> 06:11.792
They all can get their miraj.

06:13.542 --> 06:17.125
One should understand that no human being

06:17.458 --> 06:19.959
is created in this world to fight,

06:20.417 --> 06:21.875
to fight each other.

06:22.834 --> 06:24.834
Even the animals don't fight.

06:25.750 --> 06:27.625
Why should human beings fight

06:27.917 --> 06:29.709
- that, too, in the name of religion.

06:30.125 --> 06:31.542
In the name of God,

06:34.000 --> 06:35.792
Christ came on this Earth

06:36.125 --> 06:38.166
just to create oneness of religion,

06:39.083 --> 06:42.959
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

06:43.750 --> 06:45.250
dominating others.

06:45.875 --> 06:48.875
It's a big world of turmoil,

06:49.500 --> 06:53.750
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

06:53.959 --> 06:56.625
and in the name of religion.

06:57.875 --> 07:00.291
So our religion is global,

07:01.333 --> 07:02.709
is one religion.

07:03.375 --> 07:05.583
We respect all the Deities,

07:07.125 --> 07:09.125
all the Gods and Goddesses

07:10.291 --> 07:13.625
- respect Them and worship Them.

07:14.542 --> 07:18.291
We are not so stupid

07:19.417 --> 07:22.834
not to understand that They are all one.

07:24.083 --> 07:26.041
Also, after getting Realization,

07:26.375 --> 07:29.625
you realize that all these exist

07:29.834 --> 07:32.250
on our central nervous system.

07:32.917 --> 07:35.250
They exist on our chakras.

07:36.333 --> 07:39.083
They are not there

07:40.750 --> 07:44.250
just because people have told us in history and all that,

07:44.542 --> 07:46.333
but actually in that's a fact,

07:47.542 --> 07:49.834
that all of them are there together,

07:50.250 --> 07:53.417
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

07:54.500 --> 07:57.250
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

07:57.750 --> 07:59.542
is the resurrection part

08:00.250 --> 08:03.875
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

08:04.083 --> 08:07.000
He had to go through lots of ordeals

08:07.542 --> 08:10.500
and then His body itself was resurrected.

08:12.166 --> 08:14.792
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

08:15.542 --> 08:17.750
- that you get your Realization

08:18.250 --> 08:19.792
means your resurrection.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.125
All your wrong ideas disappear.

08:24.208 --> 08:26.291
All your nonsense disappears

08:26.959 --> 08:28.667
and nothing but love,

08:29.375 --> 08:32.208
understanding comes in.

08:33.709 --> 08:36.166
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

08:36.834 --> 08:41.000
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

08:41.208 --> 08:43.625
I found people are so ignorant

08:43.959 --> 08:46.333
and human beings hate each other.

08:47.458 --> 08:50.500
With some excuse, ......... with

08:50.709 --> 08:54.458
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

08:54.667 --> 08:58.166
historical ideas, and they hate.

09:00.250 --> 09:03.583
This hating in India has been there,

09:04.000 --> 09:06.709
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

09:07.583 --> 09:10.500
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

09:11.083 --> 09:13.834
He was a satanic force who incarnated

09:15.166 --> 09:17.709
and did all kinds of horrible things.

09:18.667 --> 09:20.875
The way he has killed people,

09:21.000 --> 09:24.542
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

09:26.125 --> 09:27.750
He killed children.

09:28.667 --> 09:33.417
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

09:33.917 --> 09:35.792
- such a horrible thing.

09:36.917 --> 09:37.959
When I went to Germany,

09:38.208 --> 09:40.166
they wanted Me to see all that.

09:40.375 --> 09:45.250
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

09:46.000 --> 09:47.625
But My husband went there

09:48.834 --> 09:52.542
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

09:53.542 --> 09:54.583
It's so sickening.

09:55.083 --> 09:58.375
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

09:59.041 --> 10:02.291
to kill people, under some circumstances,

10:02.834 --> 10:06.458
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

10:08.542 --> 10:11.959
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

10:12.041 --> 10:16.125
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

10:18.542 --> 10:21.291
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

10:22.166 --> 10:25.375
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

10:26.333 --> 10:29.250
Throughout, people have been killing

10:29.417 --> 10:30.834
in the name of religion.

10:31.542 --> 10:33.542
Religion teaches you to love,

10:34.458 --> 10:36.709
to love God and love each other.

10:37.500 --> 10:40.959
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

10:42.542 --> 10:45.000
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

10:45.542 --> 10:48.041
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

10:48.250 --> 10:51.917
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

10:53.667 --> 10:57.000
and it should because, after all,

10:57.250 --> 10:58.792
we are all human beings.

10:59.667 --> 11:02.166
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

11:02.500 --> 11:04.083
as Christ had.

11:04.709 --> 11:08.500
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

11:09.125 --> 11:11.166
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.500
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

11:15.709 --> 11:18.500
He's described it very well, very clearly.

11:19.500 --> 11:20.917
But who wants that?

11:22.250 --> 11:24.125
They don't want to have their miraj.

11:24.875 --> 11:26.709
If somebody tries to work it out,

11:27.125 --> 11:29.959
they get after that person, saying

11:30.166 --> 11:32.208
that  "This is something ridiculous."

11:34.125 --> 11:35.333
It's all wrong.

11:36.250 --> 11:40.750
I mean this has happened with all of them.

11:41.625 --> 11:43.500
All of them have suffered

11:43.792 --> 11:46.834
because of the ignorance  of human beings - all of them.

11:48.500 --> 11:54.250
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

11:55.208 --> 11:58.000
But I am much more powerful,

11:58.333 --> 12:01.291
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

12:02.583 --> 12:04.625
And it's working out all over the world now,

12:04.834 --> 12:09.333
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

12:09.542 --> 12:13.667
this kind of a wrong idea about others

12:14.250 --> 12:16.917
is absolutely dangerous.

12:18.208 --> 12:24.000
And so, once large number of people know this,

12:25.125 --> 12:27.166
I'm sure it will all finish off.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.458
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

12:34.583 --> 12:37.709
That just because you follow a particular religion,

12:38.125 --> 12:39.250
people hate you.

12:40.166 --> 12:41.667
I mean I can't understand.

12:43.917 --> 12:46.792
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

12:46.792 --> 12:51.875
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

12:52.417 --> 12:56.750
in the name of God, who has created you.

12:57.125 --> 12:59.417
They don't understand God and His love.

13:03.083 --> 13:07.583
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.500
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

13:10.792 --> 13:14.291
when He was crucified.

13:16.041 --> 13:18.333
His mother had to suffer so much.

13:20.417 --> 13:23.083
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

13:23.875 --> 13:26.375
Because He was teaching about love.

13:27.625 --> 13:31.875
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

13:33.125 --> 13:35.542
How can you help people if you don't love?

13:37.291 --> 13:42.792
Under what premises do you help others?

13:44.291 --> 13:45.792
Because you love,

13:46.583 --> 13:49.834
that's why you want to enjoy others

13:50.125 --> 13:51.709
and to understand.

13:51.750 --> 13:54.250
Once you start loving others,

13:54.709 --> 13:59.166
then this myth finishes off.

14:00.542 --> 14:02.583
Supposing you are born as a Christian

14:02.834 --> 14:05.125
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

14:07.750 --> 14:12.250
what makes you think that you are different from others?

14:13.792 --> 14:15.333
You are born the same way.

14:16.542 --> 14:18.917
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

14:19.875 --> 14:21.291
You look the same way.

14:22.125 --> 14:24.834
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

14:25.959 --> 14:27.417
What makes you different?

14:29.125 --> 14:31.667
I think it's something political about it,

14:33.583 --> 14:35.041
something very mean

14:35.792 --> 14:40.166
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

14:41.291 --> 14:43.542
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

14:43.750 --> 14:46.458
unite all the people in the name of God,

14:47.917 --> 14:50.375
to make them one in the name of God.

14:51.542 --> 14:53.875
Supposing there is somebody living,

14:54.625 --> 14:57.250
say, in South Africa

14:58.583 --> 15:03.041
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

15:03.291 --> 15:04.917
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

15:05.333 --> 15:08.792
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

15:09.291 --> 15:11.291
They are all your bothers and sisters.

15:12.250 --> 15:13.625
They're your own.

15:14.166 --> 15:16.625
You go there and they will

15:16.917 --> 15:19.709
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

15:22.959 --> 15:25.583
They will never think what religion you come from

15:25.959 --> 15:28.583
or what sect you come from, nothing.

15:29.250 --> 15:32.083
I was surprised the way they have love.

15:32.709 --> 15:36.291
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

15:37.375 --> 15:40.875
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

15:41.041 --> 15:44.875
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

15:45.709 --> 15:50.792
But that capacity has become so much less,

15:51.417 --> 15:55.333
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

15:55.625 --> 16:00.417
people fight and kill each other.

16:02.417 --> 16:06.625
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

16:08.917 --> 16:10.709
I don't know what - how they believe

16:11.250 --> 16:14.875
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

16:15.083 --> 16:16.750
They will go to the worst hell.

16:20.041 --> 16:24.375
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

16:24.750 --> 16:26.709
but still existing.

16:27.166 --> 16:29.291
They see it happening every day,

16:29.959 --> 16:34.917
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

16:36.041 --> 16:38.250
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

16:38.458 --> 16:39.542
We should think.

16:40.458 --> 16:44.041
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

16:44.250 --> 16:46.667
You have to be born in some religion.

16:47.458 --> 16:49.041
You cannot drop from heaven.

16:50.875 --> 16:55.959
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

16:57.083 --> 17:01.834
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

17:03.250 --> 17:05.750
And then you go on crying and weeping

17:05.959 --> 17:12.917
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

17:14.166 --> 17:16.458
How can that be? We are human beings.

17:16.959 --> 17:17.959
They are not animals.

17:18.208 --> 17:20.041
Even the dogs don't do that way.

17:21.250 --> 17:23.500
Why should we human beings kill each other

17:24.583 --> 17:31.959
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

17:33.291 --> 17:35.083
Because if you hate others,

17:36.041 --> 17:38.041
you will also become hateful.

17:39.041 --> 17:43.417
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

17:43.834 --> 17:46.959
so the whole human life and civilization

17:47.208 --> 17:49.583
has nothing to do but to hate!

17:53.959 --> 17:56.834
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

17:57.583 --> 18:01.709
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

18:02.166 --> 18:04.792
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

18:05.041 --> 18:08.208
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

18:12.250 --> 18:14.709
It's very remarkable when I came here.

18:17.041 --> 18:20.250
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

18:20.500 --> 18:24.625
There is a house of Mother Mary.

18:25.250 --> 18:30.333
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

18:31.166 --> 18:33.375
and so I said we must worship Her.

18:35.208 --> 18:37.500
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

18:38.458 --> 18:39.625
Mother is a mother.

18:41.250 --> 18:44.208
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

18:44.417 --> 18:45.750
It doesn't matter.

18:46.500 --> 18:50.333
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

18:51.041 --> 18:54.291
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

18:55.834 --> 18:57.750
Can you find such a mother in this world

18:58.458 --> 19:02.500
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

19:05.208 --> 19:11.125
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

19:12.875 --> 19:16.291
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

19:16.875 --> 19:18.375
because She lived here.

19:19.125 --> 19:20.125
Why did She come?

19:22.417 --> 19:24.875
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

19:25.834 --> 19:30.792
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

19:31.375 --> 19:32.750
Now with this house only,

19:32.959 --> 19:35.083
the Christians will start a cult.

19:36.458 --> 19:39.709
They'll fight with the Muslims

19:40.083 --> 19:43.500
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

19:43.750 --> 19:45.875
Anything you do, they will fight.

19:46.417 --> 19:49.333
That's the main character is to fight,

19:49.834 --> 19:53.834
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

19:55.041 --> 19:59.709
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

20:01.709 --> 20:05.917
In India we have had so many nice people

20:06.125 --> 20:08.250
who taught that we must love each other.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.792
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

20:13.959 --> 20:16.417
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

20:16.959 --> 20:18.792
In the same way, in India also,

20:19.375 --> 20:23.709
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

20:24.375 --> 20:25.959
Some of them were Muslims,

20:26.500 --> 20:28.083
some of them were Hindus

20:28.583 --> 20:31.333
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

20:31.667 --> 20:37.667
But, they're worshipped separately

20:37.875 --> 20:40.250
and people fight even in their names.

20:40.875 --> 20:42.959
They want to find something to fight.

20:44.291 --> 20:46.667
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

20:47.250 --> 20:49.583
They haven't got a human quality within them,

20:49.959 --> 20:53.792
which is love, which is affection-

20:54.875 --> 20:57.750
must enjoy your love for each other.

20:58.583 --> 21:02.166
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

21:03.375 --> 21:06.542
What does it matter if somebody is born

21:06.834 --> 21:09.208
in China or in India or anywhere?

21:09.917 --> 21:11.333
He is a human being.

21:12.250 --> 21:14.750
He, too, has the capacity to love

21:15.125 --> 21:18.417
and you should also have capacity to love.

21:21.083 --> 21:22.709
My experience is different.

21:24.125 --> 21:26.083
I went to China with My husband.

21:27.041 --> 21:27.959
In China

21:28.166 --> 21:30.959
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

21:31.208 --> 21:32.125
I don't know why.

21:33.458 --> 21:36.792
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

21:38.166 --> 21:39.542
so nice to Me

21:40.709 --> 21:42.250
and the way they treated Me,

21:42.458 --> 21:44.750
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter?  "

21:46.291 --> 21:47.959
"How are they so kind to you? "

21:48.458 --> 21:50.500
"In China they don't like Indians."

21:51.417 --> 21:52.583
I said, "It's a myth. "

21:52.959 --> 21:55.333
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

21:56.250 --> 22:02.125
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

22:03.291 --> 22:05.291
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

22:05.875 --> 22:08.417
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

22:09.500 --> 22:13.834
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

22:16.500 --> 22:22.667
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

22:23.667 --> 22:27.250
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

22:27.792 --> 22:28.875
Can you imagine?

22:30.250 --> 22:34.959
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

22:36.625 --> 22:39.500
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

22:39.709 --> 22:41.542
extremely loving."

22:42.125 --> 22:45.125
I went for My program.

22:46.583 --> 22:49.709
We had a women's conference.

22:51.083 --> 22:52.500
So I don't know why,

22:53.333 --> 22:56.625
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

22:57.709 --> 23:00.125
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

23:00.959 --> 23:05.834
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

23:06.500 --> 23:08.083
They put Me in the car.

23:08.792 --> 23:10.250
They put My luggage there

23:10.417 --> 23:12.208
and they said, "We have to directly

23:12.417 --> 23:15.000
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

23:15.875 --> 23:19.875
I went there and in this short time,

23:20.166 --> 23:23.250
these boys were really so attached to Me.

23:24.750 --> 23:27.166
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

23:27.792 --> 23:28.917
- can't believe it -

23:29.208 --> 23:32.834
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

23:34.250 --> 23:37.208
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

23:37.458 --> 23:38.667
They brought two cars -

23:40.000 --> 23:42.709
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

23:43.500 --> 23:48.458
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

23:49.041 --> 23:50.625
But I said, "What will you do?"

23:51.083 --> 23:53.333
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

23:53.750 --> 23:54.875
Can you imagine?

23:55.625 --> 23:57.542
They were no relation of mine.

23:57.750 --> 23:59.667
I've never seen them before.

24:00.917 --> 24:02.500
So one of them said,

24:02.709 --> 24:06.208
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

24:06.500 --> 24:08.291
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

24:08.709 --> 24:10.959
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

24:12.917 --> 24:15.166
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

24:15.375 --> 24:17.959
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

24:18.750 --> 24:20.333
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

24:20.458 --> 24:24.083
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

24:24.375 --> 24:25.375
I tell you,

24:25.959 --> 24:27.583
tears came into my eyes.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.208
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

24:31.625 --> 24:33.750
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

24:33.959 --> 24:36.208
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

24:37.250 --> 24:41.500
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

24:42.166 --> 24:46.083
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

24:47.917 --> 24:50.083
And they carried My Wheelchair

24:50.333 --> 24:53.500
up three storeys with their hands.

24:54.041 --> 24:55.667
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

24:55.792 --> 24:57.792
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

24:57.917 --> 24:59.458
"We want You to come."

25:00.792 --> 25:01.625
I said, "Why?"

25:02.458 --> 25:04.417
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

25:04.917 --> 25:07.208
I don't know what made them think like that.

25:08.000 --> 25:10.250
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

25:10.625 --> 25:12.709
With love, you get enlightened.

25:13.250 --> 25:16.667
With love, you get understanding.

25:17.875 --> 25:20.667
And such deep love exists within you.

25:21.458 --> 25:23.291
Now the politicians will come

25:23.417 --> 25:24.834
and tell you a story.

25:25.166 --> 25:27.041
Then somebody else will tell you,

25:27.291 --> 25:28.959
"Come and fight" and all that.

25:29.291 --> 25:32.083
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

25:33.792 --> 25:37.667
But now, now they're changing.

25:38.750 --> 25:40.917
All this world has to change

25:41.417 --> 25:43.333
because it has suffered a lot.

25:43.959 --> 25:45.542
This is no religion.

25:47.041 --> 25:50.291
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

25:51.083 --> 25:52.291
It is not.

25:52.542 --> 25:56.291
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

25:56.750 --> 25:58.208
is the worst thing.

25:59.083 --> 26:02.750
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

26:03.792 --> 26:08.542
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

26:11.542 --> 26:14.750
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

26:14.750 --> 26:17.083
I can't understand, stupid people.

26:19.500 --> 26:21.208
They have done so many laws

26:22.000 --> 26:25.375
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

26:26.083 --> 26:30.250
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

26:31.834 --> 26:34.333
They have no sense of pure love.

26:36.417 --> 26:39.333
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

26:39.583 --> 26:43.041
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

26:43.500 --> 26:45.667
I should say the 'property'.

26:46.667 --> 26:51.375
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

26:52.959 --> 26:58.166
It's all something very, very wretched.

26:58.417 --> 27:01.208
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

27:01.625 --> 27:03.542
Even the animals are not like that,

27:04.667 --> 27:07.500
but human beings can go to any extreme.

27:09.208 --> 27:10.959
The whole wealth of beauty,

27:11.166 --> 27:13.417
the whole wealth of creativity,

27:14.041 --> 27:17.250
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

27:17.500 --> 27:21.083
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

27:23.041 --> 27:25.250
If you are a fighting cock,

27:26.291 --> 27:30.375
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

27:31.417 --> 27:33.000
They will fight others

27:33.208 --> 27:35.875
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.208
They might say, "We must fight." All right,  fight.

27:39.417 --> 27:42.750
But then they fight among themselves also.

27:42.959 --> 27:46.750
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

27:47.542 --> 27:51.458
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

27:51.834 --> 27:53.667
Why take the name of religion?

27:54.834 --> 27:56.583
What the religion has done?

27:57.291 --> 27:59.333
How could the religion teach you such a

27:59.542 --> 28:02.917
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

28:05.208 --> 28:08.750
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

28:08.959 --> 28:15.417
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

28:16.500 --> 28:18.083
They say it is Kali Yuga.

28:19.041 --> 28:20.542
I can't understand.

28:21.625 --> 28:23.750
How can you lose the power to love?

28:24.166 --> 28:26.709
That's what Christ has talked about.

28:27.250 --> 28:29.709
He's talked about love very clearly.

28:30.875 --> 28:33.667
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

28:33.917 --> 28:35.709
Have you found anyone like that?

28:39.458 --> 28:41.250
You don't find all such people.

28:42.083 --> 28:46.500
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

28:48.000 --> 28:51.166
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

28:51.917 --> 28:55.750
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

28:56.750 --> 28:59.667
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

29:00.083 --> 29:03.500
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

29:03.709 --> 29:04.709
Nowhere.

29:05.500 --> 29:07.625
The reason is - I don't blame them

29:08.041 --> 29:10.041
- because they had no Realization.

29:11.208 --> 29:13.041
They didn't know their spirit.

29:13.667 --> 29:15.375
If you have no Realization,

29:15.875 --> 29:18.333
you cannot understand anything,

29:18.667 --> 29:22.834
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.542
I mean,

29:26.375 --> 29:28.250
if you go to Germany,

29:29.959 --> 29:32.959
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

29:33.583 --> 29:37.125
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

29:37.792 --> 29:40.417
Even you go to Japan

29:40.709 --> 29:43.709
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

29:44.959 --> 29:46.208
this - my goodness,

29:46.917 --> 29:49.583
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

29:49.834 --> 29:53.333
I said,  "How could human beings be that cruel?"

29:55.250 --> 29:56.542
Horrible!

29:57.291 --> 29:58.583
I mean now the days have come that

29:58.792 --> 30:00.291
they're killing their own children.

30:01.166 --> 30:02.542
Extreme is this.

30:03.709 --> 30:05.959
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

30:06.792 --> 30:10.375
in which you love all human beings

30:11.500 --> 30:14.041
because they're human beings.

30:15.166 --> 30:17.750
They're born with you in this time.

30:18.834 --> 30:20.500
You have to help each other

30:20.917 --> 30:22.333
and love each other.

30:23.834 --> 30:25.000
This is the main thing.

30:25.291 --> 30:27.125
If you can develop this,

30:27.750 --> 30:30.000
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

30:30.542 --> 30:33.959
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

30:35.500 --> 30:36.917
Divine will help you

30:37.333 --> 30:39.709
and take you out of all troubles

30:40.166 --> 30:43.875
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

30:44.375 --> 30:48.083
if you are a loving personality.

30:48.667 --> 30:51.375
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

30:51.625 --> 30:52.792
It didn't exist (like this before.)

30:53.208 --> 30:57.583
Now, if you are a loving person,

30:58.458 --> 31:01.583
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

31:02.125 --> 31:04.166
to sort out your problems,

31:04.750 --> 31:06.750
to punish those who are troubling you.

31:06.959 --> 31:09.417
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

31:10.500 --> 31:12.834
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

31:13.041 --> 31:14.500
I don't fight. I don't shout.

31:16.083 --> 31:18.041
Automatically, it works.

31:18.917 --> 31:21.291
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

31:22.000 --> 31:28.875
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

31:29.041 --> 31:32.542
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

31:33.542 --> 31:38.542
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

31:38.792 --> 31:39.750
take it from Me.

31:40.458 --> 31:42.291
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

31:42.500 --> 31:44.709
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

31:45.125 --> 31:47.458
People are horrible. This is that.

31:47.750 --> 31:50.041
But there's one thing

31:50.458 --> 31:55.875
that this Divine has become very alert.

31:56.041 --> 31:57.500
It was never that alert.

31:58.583 --> 32:00.500
If Christ was born at this time,

32:00.750 --> 32:02.583
He could not have been crucified.

32:05.792 --> 32:10.083
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

32:11.083 --> 32:13.208
That's a very big blessing for us.

32:13.542 --> 32:15.291
Nobody can be tortured.

32:15.750 --> 32:17.917
Nobody can be troubled.

32:18.959 --> 32:22.375
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

32:23.375 --> 32:25.417
You have to have a good character

32:26.333 --> 32:30.583
and you have to have a very loving personality.

32:30.792 --> 32:32.083
That's all.

32:32.458 --> 32:34.625
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

32:35.500 --> 32:37.291
You'll get the blessings

32:37.959 --> 32:39.667
because [of] you're loving personality.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.583
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

32:43.125 --> 32:45.542
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

32:46.166 --> 32:48.125
I'm not surprised because I know

32:48.417 --> 32:51.625
the Divine has become extremely alert

32:52.208 --> 32:55.458
towards human beings who are good and nice.

32:56.083 --> 32:57.166
It will look after.

32:57.458 --> 32:59.709
It will support. It will do everything.

33:00.834 --> 33:04.542
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

33:05.291 --> 33:07.375
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

33:07.667 --> 33:11.083
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

33:11.291 --> 33:13.208
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

33:13.250 --> 33:14.709
Take it from Me.

33:15.458 --> 33:18.500
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

33:19.166 --> 33:21.750
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

33:21.917 --> 33:25.083
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

33:25.500 --> 33:27.166
how they have been supported,

33:27.667 --> 33:29.417
how they have been helped.

33:30.125 --> 33:34.041
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

33:38.333 --> 33:42.917
So we have to trust in ourselves

33:43.875 --> 33:47.208
and we have to really love people.

33:48.125 --> 33:50.834
We should be humble and love.

33:51.375 --> 33:55.333
All this love will help you all your life.

33:56.041 --> 33:58.750
This is the message of Christ.

33:59.041 --> 34:01.542
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

34:02.000 --> 34:03.166
How lovingly He said,

34:03.333 --> 34:06.208
"But they don't know what they're doing."

34:07.041 --> 34:09.166
Very lovingly He pleads

34:09.417 --> 34:12.208
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

34:12.500 --> 34:14.542
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

34:15.083 --> 34:17.208
because they don't know what they are doing."

34:17.792 --> 34:21.083
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

34:21.417 --> 34:27.625
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

34:28.083 --> 34:30.625
we have to worship that character within us,

34:31.000 --> 34:33.083
that we are also loving people.

34:33.417 --> 34:34.583
We love each other.

34:34.959 --> 34:38.542
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

34:38.875 --> 34:41.834
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

34:42.041 --> 34:46.041
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

34:46.667 --> 34:49.375
My blessings to you is this -

34:49.583 --> 34:54.250
on this day may God give you lots of love,

34:55.083 --> 34:58.041
and loving capacity within you,

34:58.667 --> 35:00.333
that you should have,

35:00.625 --> 35:03.250
which will change your life completely

35:03.583 --> 35:06.709
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

35:07.291 --> 35:09.834
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

35:10.834 --> 35:14.208
You can do marvels and miracles

35:14.917 --> 35:19.208
if you have developed the understanding of love.

35:20.709 --> 35:22.208
May God bless you
