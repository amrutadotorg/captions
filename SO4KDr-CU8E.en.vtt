00:01:10.583 --> 00:01:16.250
Today we have come here

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:22.208
to worship Jesus Christ and His Mother.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.166
It's such a coincidence

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:29.458
that the Mother of Christ

00:01:29.458 --> 00:01:32.166
came and stayed in Turkey.

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:35.333
Isn't it surprising

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.333
that She should come here

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:43.041
after the crucifixion of Christ and stayed here.

00:01:43.458 --> 00:01:47.959
I wonder if He also came with Her later on?

00:01:48.333 --> 00:01:50.709
But they say then He went to Kashmir

00:01:50.917 --> 00:01:52.834
and She was also there.

00:01:53.417 --> 00:01:56.083
Quite possible, on their way

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.500
they might have gone there.

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:04.834
So we are here to worship Him.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.250
According to Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.542
She was the incarnation of Mahalakshmi

00:02:21.291 --> 00:02:25.834
and She's the one who sacrificed Her Son

00:02:26.291 --> 00:02:31.250
for the sake of religion.

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.250
But unfortunately,

00:02:35.583 --> 00:02:37.959
nobody understood Her value.

00:02:40.125 --> 00:02:42.041
Nobody saw

00:02:42.166 --> 00:02:47.375
that She was such a great spiritual personality.

00:02:47.875 --> 00:02:50.125
Only through Sahaja Yoga

00:02:50.625 --> 00:02:52.792
you can understand that She was

00:02:53.041 --> 00:02:55.834
a very great personality

00:02:56.083 --> 00:03:00.125
who gave birth to Christ.

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.959
It is very unfortunate

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:13.417
that She was not respected,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.166
specially in the Islamic world.

00:03:18.875 --> 00:03:20.083
Because of that,

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:27.458
the women in the Islamic culture have no place.

00:03:29.667 --> 00:03:34.250
My experience is very sad about them.

00:03:36.458 --> 00:03:38.750
We have started an organization

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:42.250
for the rehabilitation of women

00:03:42.792 --> 00:03:46.417
who are destitutes and all of them

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.208
who have applied are Muslim ladies - very sad.

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:54.875
While Muhammed Sahib has said

00:03:54.875 --> 00:03:57.959
that "you must look after your mother"

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:01.250
despite that all these women

00:04:01.834 --> 00:04:06.750
some of them have eight children, ten children

00:04:07.041 --> 00:04:09.792
- have come to this destitute home.

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:13.750
Of course, we have to give them place.

00:04:13.792 --> 00:04:16.333
We have to look after them

00:04:16.333 --> 00:04:18.667
because we don't believe in all these

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:23.750
small type of ideas about religion.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.667
Most important is 'human' religion.

00:04:29.709 --> 00:04:32.792
We have to combine all these religions together.

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:36.333
It's a terrible task

00:04:36.959 --> 00:04:41.166
because Muslim won't respect Muslim.

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.625
Christians - Christians won't respect Hindus.

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:47.291
I mean it's a funny thing that's going on.

00:04:48.709 --> 00:04:50.583
They all are for God

00:04:51.417 --> 00:04:53.917
and for God's work and His love.

00:04:55.041 --> 00:04:57.625
Despite that, there's no respect.

00:04:58.417 --> 00:04:59.458
There's no love.

00:05:00.709 --> 00:05:03.166
On the contrary, they're all quarrelling, fighting,

00:05:03.333 --> 00:05:07.125
killing everywhere.

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:09.667
It's very sad

00:05:10.875 --> 00:05:13.750
that in the name of religion and God,

00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:18.333
people should become so cruel and so absurd.

00:05:20.458 --> 00:05:21.792
This is the only solution-

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:25.959
is to give them Self Realization,

00:05:27.458 --> 00:05:31.291
which is the Realization

00:05:31.583 --> 00:05:37.291
was called as miraj in the Koran.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.709
It's called as miraj.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:43.250
But they have said that nobody can get miraj.

00:05:44.625 --> 00:05:47.250
Muhammed-sahib got it, but nobody else

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:49.959
- like they have banned people

00:05:50.208 --> 00:05:52.083
from getting Self Realization,

00:05:52.583 --> 00:05:53.667
which is not true.

00:05:54.709 --> 00:05:59.000
All human beings can get Self Realization.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:04.166
Whether they are from Africa,

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:08.417
England, America, India, anywhere.

00:06:09.792 --> 00:06:11.792
They all can get their miraj.

00:06:13.542 --> 00:06:17.125
One should understand that no human being

00:06:17.458 --> 00:06:19.959
is created in this world to fight,

00:06:20.417 --> 00:06:21.875
to fight each other.

00:06:22.834 --> 00:06:24.834
Even the animals don't fight.

00:06:25.750 --> 00:06:27.625
Why should human beings fight

00:06:27.917 --> 00:06:29.709
- that, too, in the name of religion.

00:06:30.125 --> 00:06:31.542
In the name of God,

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.792
Christ came on this Earth

00:06:36.125 --> 00:06:38.166
just to create oneness of religion,

00:06:39.083 --> 00:06:42.959
but even the Christians, they only started fighting,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:45.250
dominating others.

00:06:45.875 --> 00:06:48.875
It's a big world of turmoil,

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:53.750
where everybody is fighting in the name of God

00:06:53.959 --> 00:06:56.625
and in the name of religion.

00:06:57.875 --> 00:07:00.291
So our religion is global,

00:07:01.333 --> 00:07:02.709
is one religion.

00:07:03.375 --> 00:07:05.583
We respect all the Deities,

00:07:07.125 --> 00:07:09.125
all the Gods and Goddesses

00:07:10.291 --> 00:07:13.625
- respect Them and worship Them.

00:07:14.542 --> 00:07:18.291
We are not so stupid

00:07:19.417 --> 00:07:22.834
not to understand that They are all one.

00:07:24.083 --> 00:07:26.041
Also, after getting Realization,

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:29.625
you realize that all these exist

00:07:29.834 --> 00:07:32.250
on our central nervous system.

00:07:32.917 --> 00:07:35.250
They exist on our chakras.

00:07:36.333 --> 00:07:39.083
They are not there

00:07:40.750 --> 00:07:44.250
just because people have told us in history and all that,

00:07:44.542 --> 00:07:46.333
but actually in that's a fact,

00:07:47.542 --> 00:07:49.834
that all of them are there together,

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:53.417
working out the resurrection of the whole world.

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:57.250
So the greatest thing that Christ has done

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.542
is the resurrection part

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.875
and in this resurrection, He suffered a lot.

00:08:04.083 --> 00:08:07.000
He had to go through lots of ordeals

00:08:07.542 --> 00:08:10.500
and then His body itself was resurrected.

00:08:12.166 --> 00:08:14.792
On the same lines, Sahaja Yoga is working out

00:08:15.542 --> 00:08:17.750
- that you get your Realization

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:19.792
means your resurrection.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.125
All your wrong ideas disappear.

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:26.291
All your nonsense disappears

00:08:26.959 --> 00:08:28.667
and nothing but love,

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:32.208
understanding comes in.

00:08:33.709 --> 00:08:36.166
It was difficult, I know, in the beginning

00:08:36.834 --> 00:08:41.000
to start this work in India or otherwise, also everywhere

00:08:41.208 --> 00:08:43.625
I found people are so ignorant

00:08:43.959 --> 00:08:46.333
and human beings hate each other.

00:08:47.458 --> 00:08:50.500
With some excuse, ......... with

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:54.458
some sort of a - I don't know what ideas they have,

00:08:54.667 --> 00:08:58.166
historical ideas, and they hate.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.583
This hating in India has been there,

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.709
but also abroad, like Hitler came in.

00:09:07.583 --> 00:09:10.500
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

00:09:11.083 --> 00:09:13.834
He was a satanic force who incarnated

00:09:15.166 --> 00:09:17.709
and did all kinds of horrible things.

00:09:18.667 --> 00:09:20.875
The way he has killed people,

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.542
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

00:09:26.125 --> 00:09:27.750
He killed children.

00:09:28.667 --> 00:09:33.417
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

00:09:33.917 --> 00:09:35.792
- such a horrible thing.

00:09:36.917 --> 00:09:37.959
When I went to Germany,

00:09:38.208 --> 00:09:40.166
they wanted Me to see all that.

00:09:40.375 --> 00:09:45.250
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.625
But My husband went there

00:09:48.834 --> 00:09:52.542
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

00:09:53.542 --> 00:09:54.583
It's so sickening.

00:09:55.083 --> 00:09:58.375
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

00:09:59.041 --> 00:10:02.291
to kill people, under some circumstances,

00:10:02.834 --> 00:10:06.458
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

00:10:08.542 --> 00:10:11.959
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

00:10:12.041 --> 00:10:16.125
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

00:10:18.542 --> 00:10:21.291
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

00:10:22.166 --> 00:10:25.375
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

00:10:26.333 --> 00:10:29.250
Throughout, people have been killing

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:30.834
in the name of religion.

00:10:31.542 --> 00:10:33.542
Religion teaches you to love,

00:10:34.458 --> 00:10:36.709
to love God and love each other.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:40.959
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

00:10:42.542 --> 00:10:45.000
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

00:10:45.542 --> 00:10:48.041
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:51.917
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:57.000
and it should because, after all,

00:10:57.250 --> 00:10:58.792
we are all human beings.

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:02.166
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:04.083
as Christ had.

00:11:04.709 --> 00:11:08.500
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

00:11:09.125 --> 00:11:11.166
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:11.875 --> 00:11:14.500
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

00:11:15.709 --> 00:11:18.500
He's described it very well, very clearly.

00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:20.917
But who wants that?

00:11:22.250 --> 00:11:24.125
They don't want to have their miraj.

00:11:24.875 --> 00:11:26.709
If somebody tries to work it out,

00:11:27.125 --> 00:11:29.959
they get after that person, saying

00:11:30.166 --> 00:11:32.208
that  "This is something ridiculous."

00:11:34.125 --> 00:11:35.333
It's all wrong.

00:11:36.250 --> 00:11:40.750
I mean this has happened with all of them.

00:11:41.625 --> 00:11:43.500
All of them have suffered

00:11:43.792 --> 00:11:46.834
because of the ignorance  of human beings - all of them.

00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:54.250
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

00:11:55.208 --> 00:11:58.000
But I am much more powerful,

00:11:58.333 --> 00:12:01.291
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

00:12:02.583 --> 00:12:04.625
And it's working out all over the world now,

00:12:04.834 --> 00:12:09.333
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

00:12:09.542 --> 00:12:13.667
this kind of a wrong idea about others

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:16.917
is absolutely dangerous.

00:12:18.208 --> 00:12:24.000
And so, once large number of people know this,

00:12:25.125 --> 00:12:27.166
I'm sure it will all finish off.

00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:33.458
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

00:12:34.583 --> 00:12:37.709
That just because you follow a particular religion,

00:12:38.125 --> 00:12:39.250
people hate you.

00:12:40.166 --> 00:12:41.667
I mean I can't understand.

00:12:43.917 --> 00:12:46.792
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:51.875
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

00:12:52.417 --> 00:12:56.750
in the name of God, who has created you.

00:12:57.125 --> 00:12:59.417
They don't understand God and His love.

00:13:03.083 --> 00:13:07.583
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

00:13:07.917 --> 00:13:10.500
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

00:13:10.792 --> 00:13:14.291
when He was crucified.

00:13:16.041 --> 00:13:18.333
His mother had to suffer so much.

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:23.083
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

00:13:23.875 --> 00:13:26.375
Because He was teaching about love.

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:31.875
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

00:13:33.125 --> 00:13:35.542
How can you help people if you don't love?

00:13:37.291 --> 00:13:42.792
Under what premises do you help others?

00:13:44.291 --> 00:13:45.792
Because you love,

00:13:46.583 --> 00:13:49.834
that's why you want to enjoy others

00:13:50.125 --> 00:13:51.709
and to understand.

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:54.250
Once you start loving others,

00:13:54.709 --> 00:13:59.166
then this myth finishes off.

00:14:00.542 --> 00:14:02.583
Supposing you are born as a Christian

00:14:02.834 --> 00:14:05.125
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:12.250
what makes you think that you are different from others?

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:15.333
You are born the same way.

00:14:16.542 --> 00:14:18.917
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

00:14:19.875 --> 00:14:21.291
You look the same way.

00:14:22.125 --> 00:14:24.834
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

00:14:25.959 --> 00:14:27.417
What makes you different?

00:14:29.125 --> 00:14:31.667
I think it's something political about it,

00:14:33.583 --> 00:14:35.041
something very mean

00:14:35.792 --> 00:14:40.166
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

00:14:41.291 --> 00:14:43.542
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.458
unite all the people in the name of God,

00:14:47.917 --> 00:14:50.375
to make them one in the name of God.

00:14:51.542 --> 00:14:53.875
Supposing there is somebody living,

00:14:54.625 --> 00:14:57.250
say, in South Africa

00:14:58.583 --> 00:15:03.041
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

00:15:03.291 --> 00:15:04.917
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:15:05.333 --> 00:15:08.792
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

00:15:09.291 --> 00:15:11.291
They are all your bothers and sisters.

00:15:12.250 --> 00:15:13.625
They're your own.

00:15:14.166 --> 00:15:16.625
You go there and they will

00:15:16.917 --> 00:15:19.709
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

00:15:22.959 --> 00:15:25.583
They will never think what religion you come from

00:15:25.959 --> 00:15:28.583
or what sect you come from, nothing.

00:15:29.250 --> 00:15:32.083
I was surprised the way they have love.

00:15:32.709 --> 00:15:36.291
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

00:15:37.375 --> 00:15:40.875
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

00:15:41.041 --> 00:15:44.875
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.

00:15:45.709 --> 00:15:50.792
But that capacity has become so much less,

00:15:51.417 --> 00:15:55.333
so much minimum, that, with that capacity,

00:15:55.625 --> 00:16:00.417
people fight and kill each other.

00:16:02.417 --> 00:16:06.625
It's a greatest sin to kill people in the name of religion.

00:16:08.917 --> 00:16:10.709
I don't know what - how they believe

00:16:11.250 --> 00:16:14.875
that, by killing each other, we can go to heaven.

00:16:15.083 --> 00:16:16.750
They will go to the worst hell.

00:16:20.041 --> 00:16:24.375
This idea has now, of course, subsided a little,

00:16:24.750 --> 00:16:26.709
but still existing.

00:16:27.166 --> 00:16:29.291
They see it happening every day,

00:16:29.959 --> 00:16:34.917
this kind of a nonsense, but still they are continuing with it.

00:16:36.041 --> 00:16:38.250
Now what can we Sahaja Yogis do about it?

00:16:38.458 --> 00:16:39.542
We should think.

00:16:40.458 --> 00:16:44.041
Let us see, whatever religion we are born, that's what.

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.667
You have to be born in some religion.

00:16:47.458 --> 00:16:49.041
You cannot drop from heaven.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:55.959
So whatever religion you are born, you are not bound by that.

00:16:57.083 --> 00:17:01.834
You are bound by the religion of love and joy.

00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:05.750
And then you go on crying and weeping

00:17:05.959 --> 00:17:12.917
and teaching and … of unhappiness, of fighting.

00:17:14.166 --> 00:17:16.458
How can that be? We are human beings.

00:17:16.959 --> 00:17:17.959
They are not animals.

00:17:18.208 --> 00:17:20.041
Even the dogs don't do that way.

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.500
Why should we human beings kill each other

00:17:24.583 --> 00:17:31.959
and make a miserable life for others and for yourself?

00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:35.083
Because if you hate others,

00:17:36.041 --> 00:17:38.041
you will also become hateful.

00:17:39.041 --> 00:17:43.417
A will hate the B and then the B will hate the A,

00:17:43.834 --> 00:17:46.959
so the whole human life and civilization

00:17:47.208 --> 00:17:49.583
has nothing to do but to hate!

00:17:53.959 --> 00:17:56.834
Sahaja Yoga is such a blessing to you, I must say,

00:17:57.583 --> 00:18:01.709
because it has given to you all the Deities within you, enlightened

00:18:02.166 --> 00:18:04.792
and now you know you are belong to the whole.

00:18:05.041 --> 00:18:08.208
You know you are not belonging to some stupid ideas.

00:18:12.250 --> 00:18:14.709
It's very remarkable when I came here.

00:18:17.041 --> 00:18:20.250
I knew Mary lived here. I knew Mother Mary lived here.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:24.625
There is a house of Mother Mary.

00:18:25.250 --> 00:18:30.333
That gave Me a very great joy to know that She had lived here

00:18:31.166 --> 00:18:33.375
and so I said we must worship Her.

00:18:35.208 --> 00:18:37.500
After all, She was a mother of Christ!

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:39.625
Mother is a mother.

00:18:41.250 --> 00:18:44.208
What does it matter whether She was a Christian, Hindu, Muslim?

00:18:44.417 --> 00:18:45.750
It doesn't matter.

00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:50.333
And for Her love, She allowed Her son to be sacrificed

00:18:51.041 --> 00:18:54.291
for the whole world and for the universe - what a mother!

00:18:55.834 --> 00:18:57.750
Can you find such a mother in this world

00:18:58.458 --> 00:19:02.500
who will allow Her own son to be crucified -

00:19:05.208 --> 00:19:11.125
such a courageous, loving and global personality.

00:19:12.875 --> 00:19:16.291
Here we are. It's a coincidence, as I said,

00:19:16.875 --> 00:19:18.375
because She lived here.

00:19:19.125 --> 00:19:20.125
Why did She come?

00:19:22.417 --> 00:19:24.875
Why did She come here? She could have gone directly.

00:19:25.834 --> 00:19:30.792
She came here and lived and we have a house of Her.

00:19:31.375 --> 00:19:32.750
Now with this house only,

00:19:32.959 --> 00:19:35.083
the Christians will start a cult.

00:19:36.458 --> 00:19:39.709
They'll fight with the Muslims

00:19:40.083 --> 00:19:43.500
and the Muslims will fight with the Christians.

00:19:43.750 --> 00:19:45.875
Anything you do, they will fight.

00:19:46.417 --> 00:19:49.333
That's the main character is to fight,

00:19:49.834 --> 00:19:53.834
not to help others, not to help each other - no, not at all.

00:19:55.041 --> 00:19:59.709
They're just trying to be very, very funny and nasty.

00:20:01.709 --> 00:20:05.917
In India we have had so many nice people

00:20:06.125 --> 00:20:08.250
who taught that we must love each other.

00:20:09.458 --> 00:20:11.792
Despite that, in India people are fighting.

00:20:13.959 --> 00:20:16.417
They have had so many Sufis in this country.

00:20:16.959 --> 00:20:18.792
In the same way, in India also,

00:20:19.375 --> 00:20:23.709
we have had very great saints, very great - everywhere.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:25.959
Some of them were Muslims,

00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.083
some of them were Hindus

00:20:28.583 --> 00:20:31.333
and people sing their songs; everything's there.

00:20:31.667 --> 00:20:37.667
But, they're worshipped separately

00:20:37.875 --> 00:20:40.250
and people fight even in their names.

00:20:40.875 --> 00:20:42.959
They want to find something to fight.

00:20:44.291 --> 00:20:46.667
Real fighting cocks, I tell you they are.

00:20:47.250 --> 00:20:49.583
They haven't got a human quality within them,

00:20:49.959 --> 00:20:53.792
which is love, which is affection-

00:20:54.875 --> 00:20:57.750
must enjoy your love for each other.

00:20:58.583 --> 00:21:02.166
That's the thing they have lost their capacity to love.

00:21:03.375 --> 00:21:06.542
What does it matter if somebody is born

00:21:06.834 --> 00:21:09.208
in China or in India or anywhere?

00:21:09.917 --> 00:21:11.333
He is a human being.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:14.750
He, too, has the capacity to love

00:21:15.125 --> 00:21:18.417
and you should also have capacity to love.

00:21:21.083 --> 00:21:22.709
My experience is different.

00:21:24.125 --> 00:21:26.083
I went to China with My husband.

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:27.959
In China

00:21:28.166 --> 00:21:30.959
that time, they didn't have any good feelings for Indians,

00:21:31.208 --> 00:21:32.125
I don't know why.

00:21:33.458 --> 00:21:36.792
But they were so kind to Me, you won't believe,

00:21:38.166 --> 00:21:39.542
so nice to Me

00:21:40.709 --> 00:21:42.250
and the way they treated Me,

00:21:42.458 --> 00:21:44.750
everybody was surprised, " What's the matter?  "

00:21:46.291 --> 00:21:47.959
"How are they so kind to you? "

00:21:48.458 --> 00:21:50.500
"In China they don't like Indians."

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:52.583
I said, "It's a myth. "

00:21:52.959 --> 00:21:55.333
"I don't think I have seen that with the Chinese. "

00:21:56.250 --> 00:22:02.125
"They're extremely, extremely kind and respectful to Me. "

00:22:03.291 --> 00:22:05.291
"What have I done for them? Nothing."

00:22:05.875 --> 00:22:08.417
Well, you'll be surprised, in one of the hotels,

00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:13.834
one of My ankle ornament[s] had fallen down - silver.

00:22:16.500 --> 00:22:22.667
It did happen and then I went away to a very far fetched place

00:22:23.667 --> 00:22:27.250
and they sent it in an envelope, those anklets.

00:22:27.792 --> 00:22:28.875
Can you imagine?

00:22:30.250 --> 00:22:34.959
All the way - I was so much full of tears.

00:22:36.625 --> 00:22:39.500
So I said "These Chinese are also very loving people,

00:22:39.709 --> 00:22:41.542
extremely loving."

00:22:42.125 --> 00:22:45.125
I went for My program.

00:22:46.583 --> 00:22:49.709
We had a women's conference.

00:22:51.083 --> 00:22:52.500
So I don't know why,

00:22:53.333 --> 00:22:56.625
but at the airport only these Chinese boys arrived.

00:22:57.709 --> 00:23:00.125
They took all My luggage. I was so late!

00:23:00.959 --> 00:23:05.834
The function was at ten o'clock and I reached about 8:30.

00:23:06.500 --> 00:23:08.083
They put Me in the car.

00:23:08.792 --> 00:23:10.250
They put My luggage there

00:23:10.417 --> 00:23:12.208
and they said, "We have to directly

00:23:12.417 --> 00:23:15.000
go to the conference." I said, "All right."

00:23:15.875 --> 00:23:19.875
I went there and in this short time,

00:23:20.166 --> 00:23:23.250
these boys were really so attached to Me.

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:27.166
When I finished the conference, they're waiting outside

00:23:27.792 --> 00:23:28.917
- can't believe it -

00:23:29.208 --> 00:23:32.834
the same Chinese people who are against Indians.

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:37.208
And then, after that, it didn't stop.

00:23:37.458 --> 00:23:38.667
They brought two cars -

00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.709
one for My wheelchair, one for Me

00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:48.458
- and they took Me to the best shopping places.

00:23:49.041 --> 00:23:50.625
But I said, "What will you do?"

00:23:51.083 --> 00:23:53.333
They said, 'We'll carry your wheelchair upstairs.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.875
Can you imagine?

00:23:55.625 --> 00:23:57.542
They were no relation of mine.

00:23:57.750 --> 00:23:59.667
I've never seen them before.

00:24:00.917 --> 00:24:02.500
So one of them said,

00:24:02.709 --> 00:24:06.208
"Tomorrow, Mother, I won't be able to come." I said, "Why?"

00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.291
He said, "I'm getting married tomorrow."

00:24:08.709 --> 00:24:10.959
And I said, "What have you been doing all this day?"

00:24:12.917 --> 00:24:15.166
He said, "I enjoyed your company so much"

00:24:15.375 --> 00:24:17.959
I'm such an old woman like Me - young people.

00:24:18.750 --> 00:24:20.333
"No, no, no, no, I've enjoyed.

00:24:20.458 --> 00:24:24.083
I'll also bring my bride for You to be seen."

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:25.375
I tell you,

00:24:25.959 --> 00:24:27.583
tears came into my eyes.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.208
I said, "Such love, such kindness."

00:24:31.625 --> 00:24:33.750
I didn't do anything for them, nothing.

00:24:33.959 --> 00:24:36.208
I didn't give them any money, nothing.

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:41.500
My goodness, till the end they were so much attentive to Me

00:24:42.166 --> 00:24:46.083
- very young boys, all below twenty-five years of age.

00:24:47.917 --> 00:24:50.083
And they carried My Wheelchair

00:24:50.333 --> 00:24:53.500
up three storeys with their hands.

00:24:54.041 --> 00:24:55.667
I said, "Don't do it, I don't want …"

00:24:55.792 --> 00:24:57.792
(They said,) "No, no, no, no, we want You to see."

00:24:57.917 --> 00:24:59.458
"We want You to come."

00:25:00.792 --> 00:25:01.625
I said, "Why?"

00:25:02.458 --> 00:25:04.417
[They] said, "It would be nice for all of them."

00:25:04.917 --> 00:25:07.208
I don't know what made them think like that.

00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.250
Such enlightened people, I tell you.

00:25:10.625 --> 00:25:12.709
With love, you get enlightened.

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:16.667
With love, you get understanding.

00:25:17.875 --> 00:25:20.667
And such deep love exists within you.

00:25:21.458 --> 00:25:23.291
Now the politicians will come

00:25:23.417 --> 00:25:24.834
and tell you a story.

00:25:25.166 --> 00:25:27.041
Then somebody else will tell you,

00:25:27.291 --> 00:25:28.959
"Come and fight" and all that.

00:25:29.291 --> 00:25:32.083
That's how they have managed in Germany, young people.

00:25:33.792 --> 00:25:37.667
But now, now they're changing.

00:25:38.750 --> 00:25:40.917
All this world has to change

00:25:41.417 --> 00:25:43.333
because it has suffered a lot.

00:25:43.959 --> 00:25:45.542
This is no religion.

00:25:47.041 --> 00:25:50.291
This is not the teachings of the saints - no.

00:25:51.083 --> 00:25:52.291
It is not.

00:25:52.542 --> 00:25:56.291
It is devilish, that teaches you to hate others,

00:25:56.750 --> 00:25:58.208
is the worst thing.

00:25:59.083 --> 00:26:02.750
I mean all the enjoyment of love,

00:26:03.792 --> 00:26:08.542
all the enjoyment of affection, you don't know.

00:26:11.542 --> 00:26:14.750
Nowadays, you see the problem of the churches, this, that.

00:26:14.750 --> 00:26:17.083
I can't understand, stupid people.

00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:21.208
They have done so many laws

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.375
and with that laws, whatever it is, whatever may be the causes,

00:26:26.083 --> 00:26:30.250
but what's happening is that poor children are suffering.

00:26:31.834 --> 00:26:34.333
They have no sense of pure love.

00:26:36.417 --> 00:26:39.333
Nobody understands what is poor love is.

00:26:39.583 --> 00:26:43.041
Which is actually their innate quality, their innate -

00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.667
I should say the 'property'.

00:26:46.667 --> 00:26:51.375
But they don't know how you can love somebody purely!

00:26:52.959 --> 00:26:58.166
It's all something very, very wretched.

00:26:58.417 --> 00:27:01.208
It doesn't behove human beings to be like that.

00:27:01.625 --> 00:27:03.542
Even the animals are not like that,

00:27:04.667 --> 00:27:07.500
but human beings can go to any extreme.

00:27:09.208 --> 00:27:10.959
The whole wealth of beauty,

00:27:11.166 --> 00:27:13.417
the whole wealth of creativity,

00:27:14.041 --> 00:27:17.250
the whole wealth of art, artistic temperament,

00:27:17.500 --> 00:27:21.083
the whole wealth of enjoying life is finished.

00:27:23.041 --> 00:27:25.250
If you are a fighting cock,

00:27:26.291 --> 00:27:30.375
you can't see anything, any good in anyone, in anything.

00:27:31.417 --> 00:27:33.000
They will fight others

00:27:33.208 --> 00:27:35.875
and they'll fight among themselves also - is a fact.

00:27:36.625 --> 00:27:39.208
They might say, "We must fight." All right,  fight.

00:27:39.417 --> 00:27:42.750
But then they fight among themselves also.

00:27:42.959 --> 00:27:46.750
They will torture their own brothers and sisters.

00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:51.458
I mean, they don't love anyone. This is the main thing is.

00:27:51.834 --> 00:27:53.667
Why take the name of religion?

00:27:54.834 --> 00:27:56.583
What the religion has done?

00:27:57.291 --> 00:27:59.333
How could the religion teach you such a

00:27:59.542 --> 00:28:02.917
horrible thing like hatred for your own?

00:28:05.208 --> 00:28:08.750
It's not only among Christians, Hindus, Muslims, but

00:28:08.959 --> 00:28:15.417
everywhere human beings have become very dirty and filthy.

00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.083
They say it is Kali Yuga.

00:28:19.041 --> 00:28:20.542
I can't understand.

00:28:21.625 --> 00:28:23.750
How can you lose the power to love?

00:28:24.166 --> 00:28:26.709
That's what Christ has talked about.

00:28:27.250 --> 00:28:29.709
He's talked about love very clearly.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:33.667
He said, "Love thy neighbour as thyself."

00:28:33.917 --> 00:28:35.709
Have you found anyone like that?

00:28:39.458 --> 00:28:41.250
You don't find all such people.

00:28:42.083 --> 00:28:46.500
The Christians who followed Christ, what did they do?

00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.166
Muslims who followed Mohammed-sahib, what did they do?

00:28:51.917 --> 00:28:55.750
And Hindus who followed Shri Rama, what did they do?

00:28:56.750 --> 00:28:59.667
Are they anywhere near their leaders?

00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:03.500
Are they anywhere near those Incarnations of the Divine?

00:29:03.709 --> 00:29:04.709
Nowhere.

00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:07.625
The reason is - I don't blame them

00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.041
- because they had no Realization.

00:29:11.208 --> 00:29:13.041
They didn't know their spirit.

00:29:13.667 --> 00:29:15.375
If you have no Realization,

00:29:15.875 --> 00:29:18.333
you cannot understand anything,

00:29:18.667 --> 00:29:22.834
you cannot understand any enjoyment or anything.

00:29:24.500 --> 00:29:25.542
I mean,

00:29:26.375 --> 00:29:28.250
if you go to Germany,

00:29:29.959 --> 00:29:32.959
you can't go and see all the things they have done.

00:29:33.583 --> 00:29:37.125
You'll faint, if you have any human qualities.

00:29:37.792 --> 00:29:40.417
Even you go to Japan

00:29:40.709 --> 00:29:43.709
and they way they had put this Hiroshima,

00:29:44.959 --> 00:29:46.208
this - my goodness,

00:29:46.917 --> 00:29:49.583
I started trembling, I couldn't bear it.

00:29:49.834 --> 00:29:53.333
I said,  "How could human beings be that cruel?"

00:29:55.250 --> 00:29:56.542
Horrible!

00:29:57.291 --> 00:29:58.583
I mean now the days have come that

00:29:58.792 --> 00:30:00.291
they're killing their own children.

00:30:01.166 --> 00:30:02.542
Extreme is this.

00:30:03.709 --> 00:30:05.959
The other side of it is Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:06.792 --> 00:30:10.375
in which you love all human beings

00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.041
because they're human beings.

00:30:15.166 --> 00:30:17.750
They're born with you in this time.

00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:20.500
You have to help each other

00:30:20.917 --> 00:30:22.333
and love each other.

00:30:23.834 --> 00:30:25.000
This is the main thing.

00:30:25.291 --> 00:30:27.125
If you can develop this,

00:30:27.750 --> 00:30:30.000
you'll be very, very strong Sahaja Yogis

00:30:30.542 --> 00:30:33.959
and you will be supported and blessed by the Divine.

00:30:35.500 --> 00:30:36.917
Divine will help you

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:39.709
and take you out of all troubles

00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:43.875
and tribulations and all kinds of difficulties,

00:30:44.375 --> 00:30:48.083
if you are a loving personality.

00:30:48.667 --> 00:30:51.375
This is what the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:30:51.625 --> 00:30:52.792
It didn't exist (like this before.)

00:30:53.208 --> 00:30:57.583
Now, if you are a loving person,

00:30:58.458 --> 00:31:01.583
the Divine will go out of the way to help you,

00:31:02.125 --> 00:31:04.166
to sort out your problems,

00:31:04.750 --> 00:31:06.750
to punish those who are troubling you.

00:31:06.959 --> 00:31:09.417
I mean, it's My own experience like that.

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:12.834
I never do anything. I never curse anybody.

00:31:13.041 --> 00:31:14.500
I don't fight. I don't shout.

00:31:16.083 --> 00:31:18.041
Automatically, it works.

00:31:18.917 --> 00:31:21.291
I don't even tell the Divine to do anything.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:28.875
The Divine is at the greatest, just personality,

00:31:29.041 --> 00:31:32.542
I should say. That is the one who does all the justice.

00:31:33.542 --> 00:31:38.542
Nobody can suffer under the guidance and love of Divine,

00:31:38.792 --> 00:31:39.750
take it from Me.

00:31:40.458 --> 00:31:42.291
This is the blessing of Kali Yuga.

00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:44.709
I agree Kali Yuga is horrible.

00:31:45.125 --> 00:31:47.458
People are horrible. This is that.

00:31:47.750 --> 00:31:50.041
But there's one thing

00:31:50.458 --> 00:31:55.875
that this Divine has become very alert.

00:31:56.041 --> 00:31:57.500
It was never that alert.

00:31:58.583 --> 00:32:00.500
If Christ was born at this time,

00:32:00.750 --> 00:32:02.583
He could not have been crucified.

00:32:05.792 --> 00:32:10.083
It's only because He was not born during Kali Yuga.

00:32:11.083 --> 00:32:13.208
That's a very big blessing for us.

00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:15.291
Nobody can be tortured.

00:32:15.750 --> 00:32:17.917
Nobody can be troubled.

00:32:18.959 --> 00:32:22.375
Only thing, you have to be a humble person.

00:32:23.375 --> 00:32:25.417
You have to have a good character

00:32:26.333 --> 00:32:30.583
and you have to have a very loving personality.

00:32:30.792 --> 00:32:32.083
That's all.

00:32:32.458 --> 00:32:34.625
You'll enjoy the loving personality.

00:32:35.500 --> 00:32:37.291
You'll get the blessings

00:32:37.959 --> 00:32:39.667
because [of] you're loving personality.

00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.583
I mean, the way the Divine looks after you,

00:32:43.125 --> 00:32:45.542
there are so many miracles people tell Me.

00:32:46.166 --> 00:32:48.125
I'm not surprised because I know

00:32:48.417 --> 00:32:51.625
the Divine has become extremely alert

00:32:52.208 --> 00:32:55.458
towards human beings who are good and nice.

00:32:56.083 --> 00:32:57.166
It will look after.

00:32:57.458 --> 00:32:59.709
It will support. It will do everything.

00:33:00.834 --> 00:33:04.542
It's very surprising that it has become so alert.

00:33:05.291 --> 00:33:07.375
Like Muahmmed-sahib suffered so much.

00:33:07.667 --> 00:33:11.083
Everybody suffered so much, but not now.

00:33:11.291 --> 00:33:13.208
Now the Sahaja Yogis won't suffer.

00:33:13.250 --> 00:33:14.709
Take it from Me.

00:33:15.458 --> 00:33:18.500
They're looked after by the Divine itself.

00:33:19.166 --> 00:33:21.750
Everything is looked after. I will tell you,

00:33:21.917 --> 00:33:25.083
people have written letters after letters all over the world,

00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:27.166
how they have been supported,

00:33:27.667 --> 00:33:29.417
how they have been helped.

00:33:30.125 --> 00:33:34.041
Very surprising how they have been rescued.

00:33:38.333 --> 00:33:42.917
So we have to trust in ourselves

00:33:43.875 --> 00:33:47.208
and we have to really love people.

00:33:48.125 --> 00:33:50.834
We should be humble and love.

00:33:51.375 --> 00:33:55.333
All this love will help you all your life.

00:33:56.041 --> 00:33:58.750
This is the message of Christ.

00:33:59.041 --> 00:34:01.542
Christ has said, "Forgive them."

00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.166
How lovingly He said,

00:34:03.333 --> 00:34:06.208
"But they don't know what they're doing."

00:34:07.041 --> 00:34:09.166
Very lovingly He pleads

00:34:09.417 --> 00:34:12.208
for all the bad people who crucified Him,

00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.542
that "Oh, Lord, please forgive them

00:34:15.083 --> 00:34:17.208
because they don't know what they are doing."

00:34:17.792 --> 00:34:21.083
Can you imagine such a loving character of Christ?

00:34:21.417 --> 00:34:27.625
And now, when we are celebrating and worshipping Him,

00:34:28.083 --> 00:34:30.625
we have to worship that character within us,

00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:33.083
that we are also loving people.

00:34:33.417 --> 00:34:34.583
We love each other.

00:34:34.959 --> 00:34:38.542
All over the world, all the Sahaja Yogis love each other.

00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:41.834
Of course, there could be one or two who are not so good,

00:34:42.041 --> 00:34:46.041
but mostly, ninety-nine percent Sahaja Yogis love each other.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:49.375
My blessings to you is this -

00:34:49.583 --> 00:34:54.250
on this day may God give you lots of love,

00:34:55.083 --> 00:34:58.041
and loving capacity within you,

00:34:58.667 --> 00:35:00.333
that you should have,

00:35:00.625 --> 00:35:03.250
which will change your life completely

00:35:03.583 --> 00:35:06.709
and you'll become such a powerful personality,

00:35:07.291 --> 00:35:09.834
very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

00:35:10.834 --> 00:35:14.208
You can do marvels and miracles

00:35:14.917 --> 00:35:19.208
if you have developed the understanding of love.

00:35:20.709 --> 00:35:22.208
May God bless you
