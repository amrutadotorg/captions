Easter Puja, Hounslow, UK - 1985-0408

02:05.633 --> 02:09.751
Happy Easter to you all.

02:11.251 --> 02:16.761
So we celebrate Easter

02:16.962 --> 02:22.675
to show how Christ resurrected, resurrected Himself.

02:23.451 --> 02:30.189
The spirit that is Christ has to resurrect

02:30.389 --> 02:43.387
out of the material manifestation of the divine itself.

02:43.588 --> 02:51.521
The matter is manifested,

02:51.721 --> 03:01.395
because we ourselves have created it.

03:01.595 --> 03:10.367
Not that we are born out of matter, our body,

03:10.567 --> 03:16.887
but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it.

03:18.208 --> 03:26.762
Whatever you want, that sustains itself by your desire,

03:26.962 --> 03:31.272
because now you are on the stage.

03:31.472 --> 03:35.358
If you want to sustain the matter,

03:35.558 --> 03:41.408
if you want to keep the matter as the first priority,

03:41.608 --> 03:45.827
it will remain.

03:46.577 --> 03:49.833
It cannot disappear.

03:50.033 --> 03:54.012
It has to go out of your mind,

03:54.212 --> 03:58.754
that matter cannot hold you any further.

03:58.954 --> 04:05.429
Christ rose out of the matter, came out
of the tomb which symbolises the matter

04:05.629 --> 04:10.632
which has enclosed us within,

04:10.832 --> 04:15.979
which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

04:16.179 --> 04:20.507
Throw away, throw away the stone that is covering this grave.

04:20.708 --> 04:30.299
Get out of that and stand outside it.

04:31.799 --> 04:35.749
This is the message of Christ’s resurrection.

04:35.950 --> 04:42.719
The tomb that we have created, we have created ourselves,

04:42.920 --> 04:51.338
because we have allowed people to dominate us.

04:52.588 --> 04:59.977
We have allowed them to make these graves for us,

05:00.177 --> 05:08.425
we have allowed them to bury Christ within ourselves,

05:08.625 --> 05:13.664
because we were afraid.

05:17.238 --> 05:22.918
But Christ has to rise.

05:23.488 --> 05:28.236
So we create our own matter through our conditionings,

05:28.436 --> 05:34.221
through our fears, through our absolute wrong ideas

05:34.421 --> 05:40.205
about goodness and kindness and compassion.

05:41.212 --> 05:45.341
In the light of the Spirit, you can see what we think as compassion

05:45.541 --> 05:55.676
is nothing but a kind of sympathy which leads you nowhere.

05:59.445 --> 06:03.284
But one should learn to see everything in the light of the Spirit.

06:03.484 --> 06:09.124
But do we use all the time the light of the Spirit? We do not.

06:09.324 --> 06:16.167
For Christ, it was not difficult, because He was the Spirit.

06:16.592 --> 06:20.244
But He has shown you the way.

06:20.444 --> 06:25.884
He crucified Himself to show you the way.

06:26.084 --> 06:32.692
All the ideas about sophistication,

06:32.892 --> 06:39.625
about our standing in the society,

06:39.825 --> 06:46.722
how we relate ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country,

06:46.922 --> 06:54.276
to our politics, to our economics and the world at large,

06:54.476 --> 07:00.362
all of them can tie us down to that tomb.

07:01.159 --> 07:05.342
You belong to another category, I’ve told you a hundred times.

07:05.542 --> 07:10.282
And a category which is the Spirit,

07:10.482 --> 07:17.910
which can rise above all the tombs, can throw away everything.

07:18.110 --> 07:21.433
This way you are conditioned.

07:21.633 --> 07:24.683
All absurd ideas have been accepted,

07:24.883 --> 07:31.355
which you cannot explain why you were conditioned like this.

07:33.735 --> 07:38.280
Why I talk more of conditioning? Because of England.

07:38.480 --> 07:41.110
English are very much conditioned people.

07:41.311 --> 07:43.610
The others are Americans who are abandoned.

07:43.845 --> 07:45.948
I mean, you cannot talk to them about anything

07:46.149 --> 07:50.025
because they cannot be rooted into anything.

07:50.225 --> 07:52.611
But the English are too much conditioned people,

07:52.811 --> 07:59.205
and when they are too much conditioned, they build their own tombs.

08:01.470 --> 08:04.677
All these ideas are to be seen

08:04.877 --> 08:09.903
with a new dimension of awareness that you have.

08:10.103 --> 08:14.915
You are the Spirit.

08:17.490 --> 08:21.373
Why should you worry about anything else

08:21.574 --> 08:24.527
but your vibrations?

08:24.728 --> 08:26.724
Because you are saints.

08:26.924 --> 08:32.047
You should just worry about the comfort of your Spirit.

08:32.247 --> 08:37.101
Whatever is congenial to your Spirit, just go on doing that,

08:37.301 --> 08:42.237
observing that, accumulating that and sucking within yourself.

08:42.437 --> 08:44.468
All conditionings will run away.

08:44.669 --> 08:46.669
Because these conditionings you accept,

08:46.870 --> 08:52.911
because they look comfortable, they look comfortable, but they are not.

08:57.291 --> 09:01.282
Christ is a great example and if He is the one whom you follow,

09:01.482 --> 09:05.188
if He is the one you have understood and recognised

09:05.388 --> 09:07.774
in the light of your Spirit,

09:07.974 --> 09:12.183
then you must know why did He go into the grave first of all.

09:12.383 --> 09:14.714
The Man who was so powerful,

09:14.914 --> 09:21.499
Who when He will come He’ll reduce all of them into ashes,

09:21.699 --> 09:25.077
such a great personality like Him of Ekadasha Rudra.

09:25.277 --> 09:29.382
Why did Christ

09:29.582 --> 09:34.361
allow Himself to be crucified and to be buried into that?

09:34.561 --> 09:41.330
Because He wanted to stoop down to the level of other people,

09:41.530 --> 09:44.419
to come down to that level so that people should see that

09:44.619 --> 09:50.903
through His life, they are shown that you can be resurrected.

09:51.103 --> 09:54.274
Now the Resurrection has taken place.

09:54.474 --> 10:00.998
Sahaja Yogis are resurrected no doubt, but still one foot is in the grave.

10:04.329 --> 10:07.488
And the second one I do not know whether it will be out or in,

10:07.688 --> 10:12.117
it is just halfway through.

10:13.697 --> 10:20.122
One foot is of course outside, no doubt,
but still is not yet touching the ground,

10:20.322 --> 10:23.466
and the other cannot be lifted unless you push the ground,

10:23.666 --> 10:29.676
this matter, again, to push it up.

10:31.590 --> 10:35.319
If you live with your Spirit, you should have no fears,

10:35.520 --> 10:37.839
you should have no worry.

10:38.039 --> 10:43.404
See now, I will tell you how God is showing His ways, here.

10:43.604 --> 10:50.646
Like in Durham, the fellow is now under complete fire,

10:50.846 --> 10:55.220
he does not know what to do and he himself is so stupid,

10:55.421 --> 10:59.720
as Sanskrit saying in is that "Vinash Kale Viprita
Buddhi." "When your destruction time comes,

10:59.920 --> 11:03.976
you think of all perverted things", vipareet Buddhi.

11:04.176 --> 11:10.258
So his tongue if you, I mean see to
the way he speaks, I mean, blasphemous.

11:10.458 --> 11:13.987
And he is under fire; he himself lit the fire

11:14.187 --> 11:17.706
and is now sitting on top of it. And now when he gets the heat,

11:17.906 --> 11:22.706
the heated words come out of his mouth.

11:22.906 --> 11:25.857
We don’t have to do anything; it is all done, already.

11:26.057 --> 11:31.979
They are baked and cooked in their own...

11:37.436 --> 11:41.533
So why should we have fear?

11:41.733 --> 11:47.150
But we should know what is right and what is wrong.

11:47.868 --> 11:51.263
That is only possible because you are with the Absolute

11:51.463 --> 11:54.844
that is the Spirit. And related to the Absolute,

11:55.044 --> 11:58.383
if you do everything related to it, you are doing the right thing.

11:58.583 --> 12:01.914
If you are related to Christ, how can you do wrong?

12:02.114 --> 12:06.565
That is one of the proofs that they are not Christians of any kind,

12:06.765 --> 12:11.245
because none of the Christian organisations have done anything good,

12:11.445 --> 12:19.136
whatsoever, except for creating fire for themselves.

12:20.362 --> 12:23.749
So you can see clearly how this conditioning

12:23.950 --> 12:29.386
has worked within us, because
we have been so-called Christians,

12:29.586 --> 12:33.541
we have been going to churches, we have been worshipping Christ as they told us,

12:33.742 --> 12:41.376
the way they told us we worshipped
Him, everything regimented.

12:45.168 --> 12:51.062
The One who came to resurrect us from the bondage of the grave,

12:51.262 --> 12:56.585
we used Him to build our graves.

12:58.905 --> 13:07.464
Now you are out of it, thank God, but take out the other foot, fast.

13:09.831 --> 13:14.392
This is one advantage you have because you have Christ before you,

13:14.592 --> 13:20.343
but also there is a disadvantage because Christ has been used

13:20.544 --> 13:24.215
to set you down in the grave.

13:24.416 --> 13:27.022
So change your concept about Christ,

13:27.223 --> 13:31.934
know Him through your vibrations, what He was.

13:32.134 --> 13:36.543
I mean, as a child I knew what was going wrong with Christians

13:36.743 --> 13:39.230
and left and right, little girl like Me about seven years,

13:39.430 --> 13:42.793
I used to give big lectures.

13:42.993 --> 13:46.027
Even when I was baptised, I was horrified.

13:46.227 --> 13:51.774
The way I was baptised by some stupid fellow.

13:54.551 --> 13:56.551
I did not know what was he up to.

13:56.752 --> 13:59.554
And then he put a bhoot on my head, I think,

13:59.754 --> 14:03.613
or something which hovered round and we met with a very big accident,

14:03.814 --> 14:06.328
I fell down.

14:06.528 --> 14:11.094
This bhoot must have put it in the horse, I feel, or somewhere,

14:11.294 --> 14:13.305
another bhoot.

14:13.505 --> 14:17.516
This priest, the stupid fellow, he belonged to the Lutheran Church.

14:17.716 --> 14:20.146
I don’t know what you call that. Lutheran, imagine,

14:20.346 --> 14:23.761
Martin Luther’s Church.

14:23.961 --> 14:26.675
And that is how they baptised me.

14:26.875 --> 14:34.494
I knew all about it, but I did not know what
to do. I must have kicked him quite a lot.

14:38.104 --> 14:42.835
But whatever it is, so-called, he baptised me.

14:43.036 --> 14:46.696
I had to accept all foolish stupid things in this life,

14:46.896 --> 14:49.524
because I had to show I was quite normal.

14:49.724 --> 14:56.672
I mean, being accepting stupid is normal these days.

14:56.872 --> 15:00.645
And to tolerate an idiot is even more normal.

15:00.846 --> 15:05.680
So I had to show that. I knew very well what sort of a thing it was,

15:05.880 --> 15:16.707
this fellow was up to, and I accepted the nonsense he did

15:16.907 --> 15:24.514
and many other things I accepted just
to show that I am nothing special.

15:24.714 --> 15:29.487
But I knew all about it.

15:29.687 --> 15:33.929
When I saw the way Christ was described, I was aghast.

15:34.129 --> 15:36.898
I said "what are they doing to Christ?".

15:37.098 --> 15:43.945
I mean, nicely second crucifixion going on.

15:44.968 --> 15:49.789
You also know about it.

15:50.916 --> 15:54.396
Thank God there are so many to whom I can talk

15:54.596 --> 16:00.166
and they understand my language.

16:00.747 --> 16:03.532
But the Resurrection will not be complete unless and until

16:03.732 --> 16:08.360
you pull out many out of their graves.

16:08.560 --> 16:10.777
I don’t know how you will go about it.

16:10.977 --> 16:14.355
Look at this fellow Durham gets such a publicity

16:14.555 --> 16:16.562
when he is doing all blasphemous things.

16:16.763 --> 16:21.267
He is getting all the credit and kudos from people. What about us?

16:21.468 --> 16:26.344
What are we doing?

16:26.545 --> 16:31.090
Why not we write to the newspapers? Why not we talk to them?

16:31.290 --> 16:34.328
"Observer" has given us a clue, I think. There is one gentleman,

16:34.528 --> 16:36.699
Mr. Wilson, who wrote quite nice things.

16:36.899 --> 16:39.636
Why not write to him some letters?

16:39.836 --> 16:43.946
Get to it.

16:50.335 --> 16:59.692
Because, you see, what I am a little concerned about this matter is,

16:59.892 --> 17:02.897
as it is they are half-hearted creatures.

17:03.098 --> 17:05.161
Now, if this Durham fellow speaks like that,

17:05.361 --> 17:08.010
who is now the big authority on Christianity, Christ,

17:08.210 --> 17:12.668
His Mother and every body else, Mr. Durham.

17:12.868 --> 17:15.278
And now this fellow if he goes on like this,

17:15.478 --> 17:20.364
those who are half-baked will fall off to Communism,

17:20.564 --> 17:24.952
and the rest of them who may remain also,

17:25.152 --> 17:29.199
they may accept him.

17:30.309 --> 17:38.023
So the Anglicans, the Anglo-Saxon brain, I am saying,

17:38.223 --> 17:42.586
is going to accept Mr. Durham very well, I can see that.

17:42.786 --> 17:46.373
Or else will just leave and become communists.

17:46.573 --> 17:53.248
Have nothing to do with this God who has so many problems.

17:55.904 --> 17:59.087
So in the Seminar of yours in Birmingham when you have,

17:59.287 --> 18:02.352
I would like you to think over this new thing

18:02.552 --> 18:07.165
that has come up in the heart of the Universe.

18:07.365 --> 18:09.664
Everyone knows about Durham fellow,

18:09.864 --> 18:12.500
they know he is blight, everything.

18:12.700 --> 18:16.297
But what about us? We are so many, let us try to find out

18:16.497 --> 18:20.590
how we can talk to these people sensibly,

18:20.791 --> 18:24.933
talk to these Anglicans, find out about them,

18:25.133 --> 18:29.412
and communicate to them what you have found out.

18:29.612 --> 18:32.357
You need not say in the beginning only that I am the Adi Shakti

18:32.557 --> 18:39.044
or I am the Redeemer and the Comforter, that Christ has said.

18:39.787 --> 18:43.506
But we can start talking about it. Find out these people,

18:43.706 --> 18:47.980
these Anglicans, church people, churchgoers who believe in God,

18:48.180 --> 18:52.797
who believe in Christ.

18:55.383 --> 18:58.608
I mean they are voting. Can you imagine?

18:58.808 --> 19:05.417
They are voting whether Christ was true or not. Can you vote like that?

19:07.769 --> 19:12.884
You feel you are in a lunatic asylum or what? It is terrible!

19:13.084 --> 19:19.846
They are taking votes, can you imagine such a thing like that?

19:22.282 --> 19:24.895
At this moment we have an advantage,

19:25.095 --> 19:27.506
because they are so much confused, to give them a concrete idea

19:27.706 --> 19:33.585
as to what is God, what is Christ, what is religion.

19:33.785 --> 19:37.413
One side I feel very hurt and unhappy, I think,

19:37.613 --> 19:42.291
these three days l have gone through real Resurrection myself.

19:42.491 --> 19:47.579
The way things have been about Christ,

19:47.780 --> 19:53.389
just I can’t bear it, I mean, it is too much.

19:54.382 --> 19:59.604
You all should be stirred also, should be concerned.

19:59.804 --> 20:05.786
And you must go through it and see what you can do and tell them:

20:05.986 --> 20:11.539
"Are you all mad or what? Why don’t you listen to sanity?"

20:11.739 --> 20:16.120
As you know, when I went to Australia,

20:16.320 --> 20:18.414
it is a different country altogether.

20:18.615 --> 20:23.551
They are much more sensible people than you are.

20:23.751 --> 20:25.770
I think the way they were exiled,

20:25.970 --> 20:28.309
they learnt a lesson and they are better.

20:28.509 --> 20:33.106
So I feel the English have to go into exile

20:33.306 --> 20:39.473
or jail for a while to understand, deserve it.

20:39.673 --> 20:42.664
They are very sensible, extremely sensible people.

20:42.864 --> 20:46.999
You can talk to them, sense. Everyone.

20:47.200 --> 20:50.289
The media is sensible, the people are sensible.

20:50.489 --> 20:53.433
Thousands of them came. They repeated.

20:53.633 --> 20:59.081
First programme we had once, it was 1 600, 2000.

20:59.281 --> 21:05.752
Can you imagine such people? And out of them repeats were 600.

21:05.952 --> 21:09.264
Now for the last how many years, we are having the same 600 people

21:09.465 --> 21:12.224
again and again? What Seminars are we going to do?

21:12.424 --> 21:18.169
All of us sitting and cooking some chicken, that’s all.

21:21.164 --> 21:27.589
Or making some cake for Mother which She doesn’t eat.

21:27.789 --> 21:35.557
Let us take out our satisfactions from these
little, little things into some thing bigger.

21:36.245 --> 21:42.549
Let us talk about it, without fear.

21:43.839 --> 21:46.871
We have to go and talk and tell people about it.

21:47.071 --> 21:52.020
Take it a big way.

21:52.220 --> 21:55.621
There should be no hindrance on this part.

21:55.822 --> 21:58.066
We are a very big group and we can assert

21:58.266 --> 22:03.551
and we can talk and meet people.

22:08.343 --> 22:12.276
The situation has improved a lot,

22:12.476 --> 22:19.740
because now I have to go to India as you know,

22:19.940 --> 22:27.094
and in India, for me, the situation is much better.

22:27.294 --> 22:29.782
It is not at all difficult.

22:29.982 --> 22:37.597
As you know, I went to the hills at the foothill of Himalayas.

22:37.797 --> 22:40.019
About 3000 people came from all over,

22:40.219 --> 22:44.793
the little, little villages that they had.

22:44.993 --> 22:47.295
They didn’t take even a second to recognise me,

22:47.495 --> 22:52.145
they were singing the praise of the Goddess of the Hills,

22:52.345 --> 22:56.336
Goddess of the Tigers, Goddess of the Lions.

22:56.536 --> 23:00.219
They just started singing my praise.

23:00.419 --> 23:03.563
Without any lecture or anything. They were all joyous

23:03.763 --> 23:07.077
that I have been there and they knew and they accepted Me and finished.

23:07.278 --> 23:12.039
And I just had to put my foot
down there and I have done.

23:12.239 --> 23:19.810
Jaipur, they said, "Mother you just put your foot here", really!

23:20.804 --> 23:23.902
So for me the situation is very good in India.

23:24.103 --> 23:27.010
Now let’s see what you people are going to do

23:27.210 --> 23:31.389
with these big big Seminars and lectures.

23:31.589 --> 23:35.842
Why not get some outsiders to listen to you?

23:36.042 --> 23:39.490
Invite them.

23:39.690 --> 23:45.709
Invite these intellectuals.

23:47.185 --> 23:52.636
Try to talk to them, tell them what is it.

23:52.836 --> 23:57.379
What do you call them, those who know about Bible?

23:57.579 --> 24:01.219
Theologics.

24:01.420 --> 24:07.564
Theologics, theo - what logians? Without logics!

24:07.764 --> 24:09.462
Theologics.

24:09.662 --> 24:14.469
Call these Theologians, challenge them.

24:14.669 --> 24:19.942
Why not put a challenge?

24:21.359 --> 24:26.812
You are not alone, you are so many.

24:28.226 --> 24:34.818
And don’t tell them that you wear saris when you come for my Puja.

24:35.018 --> 24:40.592
They won’t understand it, they are not that deep.

24:40.792 --> 24:45.642
You can wear your jeans.

24:45.843 --> 24:51.721
Or to convince them more, you can be punks.

24:52.989 --> 24:58.309
That would appeal to them better. You go with your punky conditions,

24:58.510 --> 25:05.008
they will jolly well have to listen to you, otherwise they are in for trouble.

25:08.102 --> 25:10.725
If they are that stupid, why not handle them?

25:10.925 --> 25:15.259
It is very easy to handle a stupid person than to handle a person

25:15.459 --> 25:19.275
who is not stupid, or who is clever.

25:19.475 --> 25:26.618
Stupid can be stupefied very easily.

25:29.447 --> 25:31.826
So I think we have to change our course, we have to take it

25:32.026 --> 25:35.762
in a big way, the whole thing, what we are going to do.

25:35.962 --> 25:38.371
All of you should give some concrete ideas

25:38.571 --> 25:43.074
as to what you would like to do.

25:43.274 --> 25:47.130
And that would be really the way it will work out.

25:47.330 --> 25:50.248
So now in the Seminar you must discuss more

25:50.448 --> 25:56.079
how to talk to these people,

25:56.279 --> 26:01.009
how to create a platform for Sahaja Yoga.

26:01.209 --> 26:08.983
Find out how do they create a platform out of nothing, like these punks.

26:11.039 --> 26:14.191
And once you do all these things,

26:14.391 --> 26:21.490
you will be surprised that they will have to listen.

26:21.690 --> 26:24.358
They will have to listen to you.

26:24.558 --> 26:29.186
Now go full ahead. I am giving you all freedom, do what you want.

26:29.386 --> 26:32.221
Except for telling them I am Adi Shakti,

26:32.421 --> 26:34.436
that they will not be able to digest,

26:34.637 --> 26:37.783
that an Indian has now become the Adi Shakti.

26:37.983 --> 26:43.770
They think now Adi Shakti has to be an English lady.

26:43.971 --> 26:48.854
At least, French.

26:57.637 --> 27:00.898
So don’t mention me. If you want you can,

27:01.098 --> 27:04.062
but don’t mention me as Guru or anything, but you should say:

27:04.262 --> 27:07.404
"She is the lady who has shown us the way" or something like that,

27:07.604 --> 27:11.537
not referring much to me, but to them.

27:11.737 --> 27:14.381
I think you should go ahead with it and work it out,

27:14.581 --> 27:16.813
because we have now had a lot of patience,

27:17.013 --> 27:20.209
now all nonsense going around us, better tell them.

27:20.409 --> 27:25.641
Or are we going to allow all of them to go to hell direct?

27:25.841 --> 27:31.038
Message of Easter. East, comes from East.

27:31.238 --> 27:34.251
I don’t know why they call it Easter.

27:34.451 --> 27:37.995
Have you ever thought of it?

27:38.195 --> 27:42.003
Why do they call it a Worcester Sauce, I don’t know.

27:42.203 --> 27:44.268
I don’t know why they call anything anything.

27:44.468 --> 27:50.787
But Easter,

27:50.987 --> 27:53.599
you can’t explain, you know.

27:53.799 --> 27:57.443
Like "curved screen", you don't know.

27:57.643 --> 28:03.820
So I don't know, but Easter, it is coming from the East.

28:04.484 --> 28:10.362
The wisdom has to come from the East, the
Resurrection has to come from the East,

28:10.562 --> 28:14.713
whether they like it or not.

28:16.252 --> 28:19.443
And that is the message of Easter today:

28:19.643 --> 28:24.368
that let us give them the chance of resurrection

28:24.568 --> 28:27.829
by talking to them, all of you.

28:28.029 --> 28:30.026
Should make it a point, go and talk to people

28:30.227 --> 28:33.792
who are in charge of theology, churches, Bibles.

28:33.992 --> 28:37.492
Go and talk to them, tell them:"What are you doing? Are you mad?

28:37.693 --> 28:40.940
Why you want to die? Why do you want to be sleep people.

28:41.140 --> 28:46.239
You don’t know anything."

28:47.574 --> 28:51.164
Another thing I would suggest that we should have regular classes,

28:51.364 --> 28:53.867
to understand Sahaja Yoga properly.

28:54.067 --> 28:57.012
I have seen some people who are Sahaja Yogis for years

28:57.212 --> 29:03.754
don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

29:03.954 --> 29:06.348
Even in Bombay, people told that:

29:06.548 --> 29:10.539
"Some of the ladies are absolutely zero as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

29:10.739 --> 29:12.754
They don’t understand what is Sahaja Yoga is,

29:12.955 --> 29:17.466
they don’t understand what is - what are the chakras are.

29:17.666 --> 29:20.115
They listen to your lecture, everything, and then like a bubble,

29:20.315 --> 29:22.584
the whole thing disappears from their minds."

29:22.784 --> 29:25.716
I don’t know who gave them these ideas, but they were quite shocked.

29:25.916 --> 29:29.060
So let us have a class-like thing for Sahaja Yogis

29:29.260 --> 29:33.758
to different topics and subjects, let us work it out.

29:33.958 --> 29:38.352
Recently you must be knowing, there is a book going to be published by

29:38.552 --> 29:42.426
Yogi Mahajan called ‘Gita Enlightened’ which is a very good book.

29:42.626 --> 29:46.682
Of course, I mean, most of it, I have helped him, he has been with me and all that,

29:46.883 --> 29:50.463
but doesn’t matter, but he has understood
the subject. The other day they published

29:50.664 --> 29:54.047
a very beautiful book in Marathi.

29:54.247 --> 29:57.726
One Suravkar, such a learned book he wrote

29:57.926 --> 30:02.570
that in the light of Gyaneshwara, what is Sahaja Yoga.

30:02.770 --> 30:08.048
And he has written it so well that anybody who is a theologian

30:08.249 --> 30:12.549
or anything, like in India, will be impressed by it.

30:12.749 --> 30:15.385
I wish I could translate that book for you.

30:15.585 --> 30:21.266
But it is all the stanzas from Gyaneshwara,

30:21.466 --> 30:26.005
which is in Marathi language. He
wrote such a nice book on Sahaja Yoga

30:26.205 --> 30:29.445
and that is what he gave on my birthday this time,

30:29.645 --> 30:34.734
something so substantial, I felt.

30:34.934 --> 30:38.315
And once it reaches into the hands of any one of these people,

30:38.515 --> 30:43.961
I mean, it will in any case.

30:44.906 --> 30:48.342
And he published himself, he brought some copies, gave it to me.

30:48.542 --> 30:51.178
And all the copies were sold out in that programme,

30:51.378 --> 30:56.432
every copy was sold out for Rs. 2 each.

30:58.060 --> 31:01.298
So this is what we have to do now, is to write,

31:01.498 --> 31:03.938
write to different magazines, meet people,

31:04.138 --> 31:06.212
tell them we want to come and talk to you.

31:06.412 --> 31:08.821
First of all you must know about Sahaja Yoga.

31:09.021 --> 31:11.021
You should be well equipped.

31:11.222 --> 31:15.110
It’s not that you can show my photograph with a light here.

31:15.310 --> 31:20.941
That is not sufficient. What is the light here, also you have to show.

31:21.141 --> 31:23.375
Only a few people know what is Sahaja Yoga,

31:23.576 --> 31:26.839
the rest of you don't know anything.

31:27.039 --> 31:30.240
Let us see what questions we have in our minds.

31:30.440 --> 31:35.756
Let us sit down and find out: "What are the questions?"

31:35.956 --> 31:38.029
"What questions are we lacking in?"

31:38.230 --> 31:41.204
"What we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga? What part we don’t know?"

31:41.404 --> 31:45.161
Let’s find out all those things, all the details. Let us write it down.

31:45.362 --> 31:50.207
Everyone of you. Whether it’s a woman, man, child, everyone can do it.

31:50.407 --> 31:53.121
Find out: "What are the questions

31:53.321 --> 31:56.313
which are not yet answered in Sahaja Yoga?"

31:56.513 --> 32:00.883
"How can we answer particular questions?"

32:01.083 --> 32:03.641
Alright? All these things can be found out.

32:03.841 --> 32:07.680
If you put your attention to it, you can easily find out what you need.

32:07.880 --> 32:11.352
Everyone has to do it. You must all be equipped.

32:11.553 --> 32:13.720
If anybody asks you a question on Sahaja Yoga

32:13.920 --> 32:17.775
and you cannot answer, I mean, how can you convince people?

32:17.975 --> 32:22.228
You take one ordinary so-called layman from Christianity,

32:22.428 --> 32:24.428
so-called Christianity again,

32:24.629 --> 32:28.700
the man is layman and the Christianity is also lay.

32:28.900 --> 32:33.523
He will give you a big lecture on Christ.

32:33.723 --> 32:36.304
Every verse in the Bible, he will tell you:

32:36.504 --> 32:42.328
"Chapters, Matthew 2, Verse 2, this is what Christ has said.

32:42.528 --> 32:45.994
That "you will be calling me Christ, Christ and I will not recognise you",

32:46.194 --> 32:51.796
telling about himself only.

32:54.916 --> 32:58.599
So you have to be absolutely equipped for it.

32:58.799 --> 33:01.185
Now you have to also know what you will confront

33:01.385 --> 33:03.943
in a particular country. For example, when I come to England,

33:04.143 --> 33:08.668
I know I have to confront these theologians and the Christ and everything.

33:08.869 --> 33:11.377
If I go to India, what I have to confront I know.

33:11.578 --> 33:17.921
I have to face it on different lines and different fronts.

33:18.133 --> 33:20.275
You don’t have to do that.

33:20.476 --> 33:22.883
Just think about your own country. For French, you have to think

33:23.083 --> 33:27.820
about France, you people have to think about this country.

33:28.020 --> 33:30.020
And then go ahead with it.

33:30.221 --> 33:34.174
You can chalk out a good programme and work it out properly.

33:34.374 --> 33:36.586
I am sure, by God’s grace, everything will work out.

33:36.786 --> 33:39.662
Because when I am going to do it now?

33:39.862 --> 33:42.201
I’m going away, as I told you, to India,

33:42.401 --> 33:45.279
and I don’t know when will I be back. You wanted to arrange

33:45.479 --> 33:49.961
my programme in England, but I think I cannot do it,

33:50.161 --> 33:52.782
because I have to go round to all the places, Europe and all that,

33:52.982 --> 33:57.024
finish that. You’d better do that touring.

33:57.224 --> 34:04.066
When I was not here, what touring did you do?

34:06.141 --> 34:09.250
Nothing.

34:10.925 --> 34:15.740
You could have toured. Now at least, these three months,

34:15.940 --> 34:18.983
when we are having a nice summer time,

34:19.183 --> 34:21.642
I’ll be travelling all over Europe, everywhere.

34:21.842 --> 34:24.892
You please see that you go round England.

34:25.092 --> 34:28.095
Visit different places, arrange programmes, talk to people,

34:28.295 --> 34:31.012
find out who are the big Johnnies there.

34:31.212 --> 34:37.754
The mayors, this, that, go and talk to them, tell them about this.

34:37.954 --> 34:41.266
That is how new programming should be done and a new dimension

34:41.466 --> 34:45.014
should be given to our Sahaja Yoga propaganda.

34:45.214 --> 34:49.302
You have done no propaganda in the right sense, in the sense that

34:49.503 --> 34:52.755
we were not so much sure about it, that we’ll work out.

34:52.956 --> 34:55.987
But now we will, because people are writing,

34:56.187 --> 35:00.906
there is an atmosphere against Christ, so we have to fight.

35:01.106 --> 35:07.195
And that is how we should become the people who are fighting for Christ.

35:07.395 --> 35:11.307
Now there could be areas where you can talk of integration,

35:11.507 --> 35:15.526
of talking about how we do not know much about Christ.

35:15.726 --> 35:18.698
That we have to go to other books to find out who He was.

35:18.898 --> 35:21.849
Why did He come on this earth? We have to go much deeper.

35:22.049 --> 35:24.036
We have to prove that there is Divine power.

35:24.236 --> 35:27.090
And you have seen how Divine power works, what wonders there are.

35:27.291 --> 35:30.025
You take my photographs. Show them: "These are the photographs,

35:30.226 --> 35:33.999
can you explain these things? That in the hand you see the sun?

35:34.200 --> 35:41.719
Show us in Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, even a star won’t twinkle."

35:43.828 --> 35:48.128
These things are to be seen in the right perspective

35:48.328 --> 35:52.865
and at the right time. We must do whatever is right at that point.

35:53.065 --> 35:55.072
That is the way Sahaja Yoga is.

35:55.273 --> 35:59.854
Hit the point when it is to be hitten.

36:00.584 --> 36:03.186
If you cannot do that way, you cannot achieve it.

36:03.386 --> 36:06.214
So this is the right time for you, there are now

36:06.415 --> 36:09.866
3 months ahead of you, I would like you to see what you can do,

36:10.066 --> 36:14.852
because now the sun will be coming out,

36:15.052 --> 36:17.258
you will have a nice summer.

36:17.458 --> 36:20.914
Go ahead. But now just do not fix all your holidays

36:21.114 --> 36:25.409
during these three months going to some beach somewhere.

36:25.609 --> 36:29.933
Sahaja Yogis have no time. They are busy people.

36:30.133 --> 36:33.804
They have no time to waste.

36:34.004 --> 36:42.759
We are on a warpath, we have no time
to quarrel among ourselves, fight.

36:42.959 --> 36:47.189
We have to fight very great enemies.

36:47.389 --> 36:50.786
We have no time to waste on our families and our children

36:50.986 --> 36:54.926
and our relations and father, mother, sister, brother.

36:55.126 --> 36:58.848
We are on a warpath, very important it is.

36:59.048 --> 37:04.618
So let us now prepare ourselves.
As Christ stood out of that grave,

37:04.819 --> 37:11.826
let us get out of this grave of lethargy, of compromising, of comfort,

37:12.026 --> 37:18.539
of our past ideas about life’s pleasures.

37:20.391 --> 37:24.851
This is the new era that has to show,

37:25.052 --> 37:29.780
it’s manifestation in this country.

37:29.980 --> 37:32.452
It is very important, and you all can do it.

37:32.652 --> 37:36.463
You have to be very brave, you have to be sensible, wise,

37:36.663 --> 37:39.946
kind and also forthright.

37:40.147 --> 37:44.041
But you have to say what you have to say, because it has to be said.

37:44.241 --> 37:48.244
And this is the only thing to be said, nothing else is important.

37:48.444 --> 37:51.354
Whatever these people talk about has no meaning.

37:51.554 --> 37:55.487
They are not mantras.

37:55.687 --> 37:59.119
Some of them are anti-God, some may not be,

37:59.319 --> 38:03.612
but they are useless, wasteful, garbages I should say.

38:03.812 --> 38:08.889
Why they are given so much importance and not the real thing that is there?

38:09.089 --> 38:17.759
You understand that this is the reality that has come into you people.

38:17.959 --> 38:21.595
Actually you have felt the reality.

38:21.795 --> 38:25.403
Actually you know the reality,

38:25.603 --> 38:31.368
you are in the reality, then why not talk about it?

38:33.173 --> 38:35.093
Why should we not?

38:35.293 --> 38:40.734
Is it not the most important thing that we have to do?

38:40.934 --> 38:43.687
If you realise it, I am sure it will work out.

38:43.887 --> 38:47.721
With all my blessings, with all my love,

38:47.921 --> 38:50.924
I really command you to do that now.

38:51.124 --> 38:55.865
May God bless you.

38:59.633 --> 39:02.316
Today, on this day you all should vow,

39:02.516 --> 39:06.066
vow that "we are on the warpath and we are going to find out

39:06.266 --> 39:08.331
ways and methods of doing these things,

39:08.532 --> 39:13.592
for these three months, we are going to work it out". Just vow.

39:13.792 --> 39:20.865
Just ask for wisdoms and the spiritual power, that’s all.

39:24.475 --> 39:32.907
And promise it to Christ that "as You did, we are going to do".

39:44.582 --> 39:49.376
May God bless you.
