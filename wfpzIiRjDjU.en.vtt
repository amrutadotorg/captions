Easter Puja, Hounslow, UK - 1985-0408

00:02:05.633 --> 00:02:09.751
Happy Easter to you all.

00:02:11.251 --> 00:02:16.761
So we celebrate Easter

00:02:16.962 --> 00:02:22.675
to show how Christ resurrected, resurrected Himself.

00:02:23.451 --> 00:02:30.189
The spirit that is Christ has to resurrect

00:02:30.389 --> 00:02:43.387
out of the material manifestation of the divine itself.

00:02:43.588 --> 00:02:51.521
The matter is manifested,

00:02:51.721 --> 00:03:01.395
because we ourselves have created it.

00:03:01.595 --> 00:03:10.367
Not that we are born out of matter, our body,

00:03:10.567 --> 00:03:16.887
but we are attached to it, we want it, we want to have it.

00:03:18.208 --> 00:03:26.762
Whatever you want, that sustains itself by your desire,

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:31.272
because now you are on the stage.

00:03:31.472 --> 00:03:35.358
If you want to sustain the matter,

00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:41.408
if you want to keep the matter as the first priority,

00:03:41.608 --> 00:03:45.827
it will remain.

00:03:46.577 --> 00:03:49.833
It cannot disappear.

00:03:50.033 --> 00:03:54.012
It has to go out of your mind,

00:03:54.212 --> 00:03:58.754
that matter cannot hold you any further.

00:03:58.954 --> 00:04:05.429
Christ rose out of the matter, came out
of the tomb which symbolises the matter

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:10.632
which has enclosed us within,

00:04:10.832 --> 00:04:15.979
which has to be opened out with our spiritual power.

00:04:16.179 --> 00:04:20.507
Throw away, throw away the stone that is covering this grave.

00:04:20.708 --> 00:04:30.299
Get out of that and stand outside it.

00:04:31.799 --> 00:04:35.749
This is the message of Christ’s resurrection.

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:42.719
The tomb that we have created, we have created ourselves,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:51.338
because we have allowed people to dominate us.

00:04:52.588 --> 00:04:59.977
We have allowed them to make these graves for us,

00:05:00.177 --> 00:05:08.425
we have allowed them to bury Christ within ourselves,

00:05:08.625 --> 00:05:13.664
because we were afraid.

00:05:17.238 --> 00:05:22.918
But Christ has to rise.

00:05:23.488 --> 00:05:28.236
So we create our own matter through our conditionings,

00:05:28.436 --> 00:05:34.221
through our fears, through our absolute wrong ideas

00:05:34.421 --> 00:05:40.205
about goodness and kindness and compassion.

00:05:41.212 --> 00:05:45.341
In the light of the Spirit, you can see what we think as compassion

00:05:45.541 --> 00:05:55.676
is nothing but a kind of sympathy which leads you nowhere.

00:05:59.445 --> 00:06:03.284
But one should learn to see everything in the light of the Spirit.

00:06:03.484 --> 00:06:09.124
But do we use all the time the light of the Spirit? We do not.

00:06:09.324 --> 00:06:16.167
For Christ, it was not difficult, because He was the Spirit.

00:06:16.592 --> 00:06:20.244
But He has shown you the way.

00:06:20.444 --> 00:06:25.884
He crucified Himself to show you the way.

00:06:26.084 --> 00:06:32.692
All the ideas about sophistication,

00:06:32.892 --> 00:06:39.625
about our standing in the society,

00:06:39.825 --> 00:06:46.722
how we relate ourselves to other dignitaries or to our country,

00:06:46.922 --> 00:06:54.276
to our politics, to our economics and the world at large,

00:06:54.476 --> 00:07:00.362
all of them can tie us down to that tomb.

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:05.342
You belong to another category, I’ve told you a hundred times.

00:07:05.542 --> 00:07:10.282
And a category which is the Spirit,

00:07:10.482 --> 00:07:17.910
which can rise above all the tombs, can throw away everything.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:21.433
This way you are conditioned.

00:07:21.633 --> 00:07:24.683
All absurd ideas have been accepted,

00:07:24.883 --> 00:07:31.355
which you cannot explain why you were conditioned like this.

00:07:33.735 --> 00:07:38.280
Why I talk more of conditioning? Because of England.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:41.110
English are very much conditioned people.

00:07:41.311 --> 00:07:43.610
The others are Americans who are abandoned.

00:07:43.845 --> 00:07:45.948
I mean, you cannot talk to them about anything

00:07:46.149 --> 00:07:50.025
because they cannot be rooted into anything.

00:07:50.225 --> 00:07:52.611
But the English are too much conditioned people,

00:07:52.811 --> 00:07:59.205
and when they are too much conditioned, they build their own tombs.

00:08:01.470 --> 00:08:04.677
All these ideas are to be seen

00:08:04.877 --> 00:08:09.903
with a new dimension of awareness that you have.

00:08:10.103 --> 00:08:14.915
You are the Spirit.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:21.373
Why should you worry about anything else

00:08:21.574 --> 00:08:24.527
but your vibrations?

00:08:24.728 --> 00:08:26.724
Because you are saints.

00:08:26.924 --> 00:08:32.047
You should just worry about the comfort of your Spirit.

00:08:32.247 --> 00:08:37.101
Whatever is congenial to your Spirit, just go on doing that,

00:08:37.301 --> 00:08:42.237
observing that, accumulating that and sucking within yourself.

00:08:42.437 --> 00:08:44.468
All conditionings will run away.

00:08:44.669 --> 00:08:46.669
Because these conditionings you accept,

00:08:46.870 --> 00:08:52.911
because they look comfortable, they look comfortable, but they are not.

00:08:57.291 --> 00:09:01.282
Christ is a great example and if He is the one whom you follow,

00:09:01.482 --> 00:09:05.188
if He is the one you have understood and recognised

00:09:05.388 --> 00:09:07.774
in the light of your Spirit,

00:09:07.974 --> 00:09:12.183
then you must know why did He go into the grave first of all.

00:09:12.383 --> 00:09:14.714
The Man who was so powerful,

00:09:14.914 --> 00:09:21.499
Who when He will come He’ll reduce all of them into ashes,

00:09:21.699 --> 00:09:25.077
such a great personality like Him of Ekadasha Rudra.

00:09:25.277 --> 00:09:29.382
Why did Christ

00:09:29.582 --> 00:09:34.361
allow Himself to be crucified and to be buried into that?

00:09:34.561 --> 00:09:41.330
Because He wanted to stoop down to the level of other people,

00:09:41.530 --> 00:09:44.419
to come down to that level so that people should see that

00:09:44.619 --> 00:09:50.903
through His life, they are shown that you can be resurrected.

00:09:51.103 --> 00:09:54.274
Now the Resurrection has taken place.

00:09:54.474 --> 00:10:00.998
Sahaja Yogis are resurrected no doubt, but still one foot is in the grave.

00:10:04.329 --> 00:10:07.488
And the second one I do not know whether it will be out or in,

00:10:07.688 --> 00:10:12.117
it is just halfway through.

00:10:13.697 --> 00:10:20.122
One foot is of course outside, no doubt,
but still is not yet touching the ground,

00:10:20.322 --> 00:10:23.466
and the other cannot be lifted unless you push the ground,

00:10:23.666 --> 00:10:29.676
this matter, again, to push it up.

00:10:31.590 --> 00:10:35.319
If you live with your Spirit, you should have no fears,

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.839
you should have no worry.

00:10:38.039 --> 00:10:43.404
See now, I will tell you how God is showing His ways, here.

00:10:43.604 --> 00:10:50.646
Like in Durham, the fellow is now under complete fire,

00:10:50.846 --> 00:10:55.220
he does not know what to do and he himself is so stupid,

00:10:55.421 --> 00:10:59.720
as Sanskrit saying in is that "Vinash Kale Viprita
Buddhi." "When your destruction time comes,

00:10:59.920 --> 00:11:03.976
you think of all perverted things", vipareet Buddhi.

00:11:04.176 --> 00:11:10.258
So his tongue if you, I mean see to
the way he speaks, I mean, blasphemous.

00:11:10.458 --> 00:11:13.987
And he is under fire; he himself lit the fire

00:11:14.187 --> 00:11:17.706
and is now sitting on top of it. And now when he gets the heat,

00:11:17.906 --> 00:11:22.706
the heated words come out of his mouth.

00:11:22.906 --> 00:11:25.857
We don’t have to do anything; it is all done, already.

00:11:26.057 --> 00:11:31.979
They are baked and cooked in their own...

00:11:37.436 --> 00:11:41.533
So why should we have fear?

00:11:41.733 --> 00:11:47.150
But we should know what is right and what is wrong.

00:11:47.868 --> 00:11:51.263
That is only possible because you are with the Absolute

00:11:51.463 --> 00:11:54.844
that is the Spirit. And related to the Absolute,

00:11:55.044 --> 00:11:58.383
if you do everything related to it, you are doing the right thing.

00:11:58.583 --> 00:12:01.914
If you are related to Christ, how can you do wrong?

00:12:02.114 --> 00:12:06.565
That is one of the proofs that they are not Christians of any kind,

00:12:06.765 --> 00:12:11.245
because none of the Christian organisations have done anything good,

00:12:11.445 --> 00:12:19.136
whatsoever, except for creating fire for themselves.

00:12:20.362 --> 00:12:23.749
So you can see clearly how this conditioning

00:12:23.950 --> 00:12:29.386
has worked within us, because
we have been so-called Christians,

00:12:29.586 --> 00:12:33.541
we have been going to churches, we have been worshipping Christ as they told us,

00:12:33.742 --> 00:12:41.376
the way they told us we worshipped
Him, everything regimented.

00:12:45.168 --> 00:12:51.062
The One who came to resurrect us from the bondage of the grave,

00:12:51.262 --> 00:12:56.585
we used Him to build our graves.

00:12:58.905 --> 00:13:07.464
Now you are out of it, thank God, but take out the other foot, fast.

00:13:09.831 --> 00:13:14.392
This is one advantage you have because you have Christ before you,

00:13:14.592 --> 00:13:20.343
but also there is a disadvantage because Christ has been used

00:13:20.544 --> 00:13:24.215
to set you down in the grave.

00:13:24.416 --> 00:13:27.022
So change your concept about Christ,

00:13:27.223 --> 00:13:31.934
know Him through your vibrations, what He was.

00:13:32.134 --> 00:13:36.543
I mean, as a child I knew what was going wrong with Christians

00:13:36.743 --> 00:13:39.230
and left and right, little girl like Me about seven years,

00:13:39.430 --> 00:13:42.793
I used to give big lectures.

00:13:42.993 --> 00:13:46.027
Even when I was baptised, I was horrified.

00:13:46.227 --> 00:13:51.774
The way I was baptised by some stupid fellow.

00:13:54.551 --> 00:13:56.551
I did not know what was he up to.

00:13:56.752 --> 00:13:59.554
And then he put a bhoot on my head, I think,

00:13:59.754 --> 00:14:03.613
or something which hovered round and we met with a very big accident,

00:14:03.814 --> 00:14:06.328
I fell down.

00:14:06.528 --> 00:14:11.094
This bhoot must have put it in the horse, I feel, or somewhere,

00:14:11.294 --> 00:14:13.305
another bhoot.

00:14:13.505 --> 00:14:17.516
This priest, the stupid fellow, he belonged to the Lutheran Church.

00:14:17.716 --> 00:14:20.146
I don’t know what you call that. Lutheran, imagine,

00:14:20.346 --> 00:14:23.761
Martin Luther’s Church.

00:14:23.961 --> 00:14:26.675
And that is how they baptised me.

00:14:26.875 --> 00:14:34.494
I knew all about it, but I did not know what
to do. I must have kicked him quite a lot.

00:14:38.104 --> 00:14:42.835
But whatever it is, so-called, he baptised me.

00:14:43.036 --> 00:14:46.696
I had to accept all foolish stupid things in this life,

00:14:46.896 --> 00:14:49.524
because I had to show I was quite normal.

00:14:49.724 --> 00:14:56.672
I mean, being accepting stupid is normal these days.

00:14:56.872 --> 00:15:00.645
And to tolerate an idiot is even more normal.

00:15:00.846 --> 00:15:05.680
So I had to show that. I knew very well what sort of a thing it was,

00:15:05.880 --> 00:15:16.707
this fellow was up to, and I accepted the nonsense he did

00:15:16.907 --> 00:15:24.514
and many other things I accepted just
to show that I am nothing special.

00:15:24.714 --> 00:15:29.487
But I knew all about it.

00:15:29.687 --> 00:15:33.929
When I saw the way Christ was described, I was aghast.

00:15:34.129 --> 00:15:36.898
I said "what are they doing to Christ?".

00:15:37.098 --> 00:15:43.945
I mean, nicely second crucifixion going on.

00:15:44.968 --> 00:15:49.789
You also know about it.

00:15:50.916 --> 00:15:54.396
Thank God there are so many to whom I can talk

00:15:54.596 --> 00:16:00.166
and they understand my language.

00:16:00.747 --> 00:16:03.532
But the Resurrection will not be complete unless and until

00:16:03.732 --> 00:16:08.360
you pull out many out of their graves.

00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:10.777
I don’t know how you will go about it.

00:16:10.977 --> 00:16:14.355
Look at this fellow Durham gets such a publicity

00:16:14.555 --> 00:16:16.562
when he is doing all blasphemous things.

00:16:16.763 --> 00:16:21.267
He is getting all the credit and kudos from people. What about us?

00:16:21.468 --> 00:16:26.344
What are we doing?

00:16:26.545 --> 00:16:31.090
Why not we write to the newspapers? Why not we talk to them?

00:16:31.290 --> 00:16:34.328
"Observer" has given us a clue, I think. There is one gentleman,

00:16:34.528 --> 00:16:36.699
Mr. Wilson, who wrote quite nice things.

00:16:36.899 --> 00:16:39.636
Why not write to him some letters?

00:16:39.836 --> 00:16:43.946
Get to it.

00:16:50.335 --> 00:16:59.692
Because, you see, what I am a little concerned about this matter is,

00:16:59.892 --> 00:17:02.897
as it is they are half-hearted creatures.

00:17:03.098 --> 00:17:05.161
Now, if this Durham fellow speaks like that,

00:17:05.361 --> 00:17:08.010
who is now the big authority on Christianity, Christ,

00:17:08.210 --> 00:17:12.668
His Mother and every body else, Mr. Durham.

00:17:12.868 --> 00:17:15.278
And now this fellow if he goes on like this,

00:17:15.478 --> 00:17:20.364
those who are half-baked will fall off to Communism,

00:17:20.564 --> 00:17:24.952
and the rest of them who may remain also,

00:17:25.152 --> 00:17:29.199
they may accept him.

00:17:30.309 --> 00:17:38.023
So the Anglicans, the Anglo-Saxon brain, I am saying,

00:17:38.223 --> 00:17:42.586
is going to accept Mr. Durham very well, I can see that.

00:17:42.786 --> 00:17:46.373
Or else will just leave and become communists.

00:17:46.573 --> 00:17:53.248
Have nothing to do with this God who has so many problems.

00:17:55.904 --> 00:17:59.087
So in the Seminar of yours in Birmingham when you have,

00:17:59.287 --> 00:18:02.352
I would like you to think over this new thing

00:18:02.552 --> 00:18:07.165
that has come up in the heart of the Universe.

00:18:07.365 --> 00:18:09.664
Everyone knows about Durham fellow,

00:18:09.864 --> 00:18:12.500
they know he is blight, everything.

00:18:12.700 --> 00:18:16.297
But what about us? We are so many, let us try to find out

00:18:16.497 --> 00:18:20.590
how we can talk to these people sensibly,

00:18:20.791 --> 00:18:24.933
talk to these Anglicans, find out about them,

00:18:25.133 --> 00:18:29.412
and communicate to them what you have found out.

00:18:29.612 --> 00:18:32.357
You need not say in the beginning only that I am the Adi Shakti

00:18:32.557 --> 00:18:39.044
or I am the Redeemer and the Comforter, that Christ has said.

00:18:39.787 --> 00:18:43.506
But we can start talking about it. Find out these people,

00:18:43.706 --> 00:18:47.980
these Anglicans, church people, churchgoers who believe in God,

00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.797
who believe in Christ.

00:18:55.383 --> 00:18:58.608
I mean they are voting. Can you imagine?

00:18:58.808 --> 00:19:05.417
They are voting whether Christ was true or not. Can you vote like that?

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:12.884
You feel you are in a lunatic asylum or what? It is terrible!

00:19:13.084 --> 00:19:19.846
They are taking votes, can you imagine such a thing like that?

00:19:22.282 --> 00:19:24.895
At this moment we have an advantage,

00:19:25.095 --> 00:19:27.506
because they are so much confused, to give them a concrete idea

00:19:27.706 --> 00:19:33.585
as to what is God, what is Christ, what is religion.

00:19:33.785 --> 00:19:37.413
One side I feel very hurt and unhappy, I think,

00:19:37.613 --> 00:19:42.291
these three days l have gone through real Resurrection myself.

00:19:42.491 --> 00:19:47.579
The way things have been about Christ,

00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:53.389
just I can’t bear it, I mean, it is too much.

00:19:54.382 --> 00:19:59.604
You all should be stirred also, should be concerned.

00:19:59.804 --> 00:20:05.786
And you must go through it and see what you can do and tell them:

00:20:05.986 --> 00:20:11.539
"Are you all mad or what? Why don’t you listen to sanity?"

00:20:11.739 --> 00:20:16.120
As you know, when I went to Australia,

00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.414
it is a different country altogether.

00:20:18.615 --> 00:20:23.551
They are much more sensible people than you are.

00:20:23.751 --> 00:20:25.770
I think the way they were exiled,

00:20:25.970 --> 00:20:28.309
they learnt a lesson and they are better.

00:20:28.509 --> 00:20:33.106
So I feel the English have to go into exile

00:20:33.306 --> 00:20:39.473
or jail for a while to understand, deserve it.

00:20:39.673 --> 00:20:42.664
They are very sensible, extremely sensible people.

00:20:42.864 --> 00:20:46.999
You can talk to them, sense. Everyone.

00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.289
The media is sensible, the people are sensible.

00:20:50.489 --> 00:20:53.433
Thousands of them came. They repeated.

00:20:53.633 --> 00:20:59.081
First programme we had once, it was 1 600, 2000.

00:20:59.281 --> 00:21:05.752
Can you imagine such people? And out of them repeats were 600.

00:21:05.952 --> 00:21:09.264
Now for the last how many years, we are having the same 600 people

00:21:09.465 --> 00:21:12.224
again and again? What Seminars are we going to do?

00:21:12.424 --> 00:21:18.169
All of us sitting and cooking some chicken, that’s all.

00:21:21.164 --> 00:21:27.589
Or making some cake for Mother which She doesn’t eat.

00:21:27.789 --> 00:21:35.557
Let us take out our satisfactions from these
little, little things into some thing bigger.

00:21:36.245 --> 00:21:42.549
Let us talk about it, without fear.

00:21:43.839 --> 00:21:46.871
We have to go and talk and tell people about it.

00:21:47.071 --> 00:21:52.020
Take it a big way.

00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:55.621
There should be no hindrance on this part.

00:21:55.822 --> 00:21:58.066
We are a very big group and we can assert

00:21:58.266 --> 00:22:03.551
and we can talk and meet people.

00:22:08.343 --> 00:22:12.276
The situation has improved a lot,

00:22:12.476 --> 00:22:19.740
because now I have to go to India as you know,

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:27.094
and in India, for me, the situation is much better.

00:22:27.294 --> 00:22:29.782
It is not at all difficult.

00:22:29.982 --> 00:22:37.597
As you know, I went to the hills at the foothill of Himalayas.

00:22:37.797 --> 00:22:40.019
About 3000 people came from all over,

00:22:40.219 --> 00:22:44.793
the little, little villages that they had.

00:22:44.993 --> 00:22:47.295
They didn’t take even a second to recognise me,

00:22:47.495 --> 00:22:52.145
they were singing the praise of the Goddess of the Hills,

00:22:52.345 --> 00:22:56.336
Goddess of the Tigers, Goddess of the Lions.

00:22:56.536 --> 00:23:00.219
They just started singing my praise.

00:23:00.419 --> 00:23:03.563
Without any lecture or anything. They were all joyous

00:23:03.763 --> 00:23:07.077
that I have been there and they knew and they accepted Me and finished.

00:23:07.278 --> 00:23:12.039
And I just had to put my foot
down there and I have done.

00:23:12.239 --> 00:23:19.810
Jaipur, they said, "Mother you just put your foot here", really!

00:23:20.804 --> 00:23:23.902
So for me the situation is very good in India.

00:23:24.103 --> 00:23:27.010
Now let’s see what you people are going to do

00:23:27.210 --> 00:23:31.389
with these big big Seminars and lectures.

00:23:31.589 --> 00:23:35.842
Why not get some outsiders to listen to you?

00:23:36.042 --> 00:23:39.490
Invite them.

00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:45.709
Invite these intellectuals.

00:23:47.185 --> 00:23:52.636
Try to talk to them, tell them what is it.

00:23:52.836 --> 00:23:57.379
What do you call them, those who know about Bible?

00:23:57.579 --> 00:24:01.219
Theologics.

00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:07.564
Theologics, theo - what logians? Without logics!

00:24:07.764 --> 00:24:09.462
Theologics.

00:24:09.662 --> 00:24:14.469
Call these Theologians, challenge them.

00:24:14.669 --> 00:24:19.942
Why not put a challenge?

00:24:21.359 --> 00:24:26.812
You are not alone, you are so many.

00:24:28.226 --> 00:24:34.818
And don’t tell them that you wear saris when you come for my Puja.

00:24:35.018 --> 00:24:40.592
They won’t understand it, they are not that deep.

00:24:40.792 --> 00:24:45.642
You can wear your jeans.

00:24:45.843 --> 00:24:51.721
Or to convince them more, you can be punks.

00:24:52.989 --> 00:24:58.309
That would appeal to them better. You go with your punky conditions,

00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:05.008
they will jolly well have to listen to you, otherwise they are in for trouble.

00:25:08.102 --> 00:25:10.725
If they are that stupid, why not handle them?

00:25:10.925 --> 00:25:15.259
It is very easy to handle a stupid person than to handle a person

00:25:15.459 --> 00:25:19.275
who is not stupid, or who is clever.

00:25:19.475 --> 00:25:26.618
Stupid can be stupefied very easily.

00:25:29.447 --> 00:25:31.826
So I think we have to change our course, we have to take it

00:25:32.026 --> 00:25:35.762
in a big way, the whole thing, what we are going to do.

00:25:35.962 --> 00:25:38.371
All of you should give some concrete ideas

00:25:38.571 --> 00:25:43.074
as to what you would like to do.

00:25:43.274 --> 00:25:47.130
And that would be really the way it will work out.

00:25:47.330 --> 00:25:50.248
So now in the Seminar you must discuss more

00:25:50.448 --> 00:25:56.079
how to talk to these people,

00:25:56.279 --> 00:26:01.009
how to create a platform for Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:01.209 --> 00:26:08.983
Find out how do they create a platform out of nothing, like these punks.

00:26:11.039 --> 00:26:14.191
And once you do all these things,

00:26:14.391 --> 00:26:21.490
you will be surprised that they will have to listen.

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.358
They will have to listen to you.

00:26:24.558 --> 00:26:29.186
Now go full ahead. I am giving you all freedom, do what you want.

00:26:29.386 --> 00:26:32.221
Except for telling them I am Adi Shakti,

00:26:32.421 --> 00:26:34.436
that they will not be able to digest,

00:26:34.637 --> 00:26:37.783
that an Indian has now become the Adi Shakti.

00:26:37.983 --> 00:26:43.770
They think now Adi Shakti has to be an English lady.

00:26:43.971 --> 00:26:48.854
At least, French.

00:26:57.637 --> 00:27:00.898
So don’t mention me. If you want you can,

00:27:01.098 --> 00:27:04.062
but don’t mention me as Guru or anything, but you should say:

00:27:04.262 --> 00:27:07.404
"She is the lady who has shown us the way" or something like that,

00:27:07.604 --> 00:27:11.537
not referring much to me, but to them.

00:27:11.737 --> 00:27:14.381
I think you should go ahead with it and work it out,

00:27:14.581 --> 00:27:16.813
because we have now had a lot of patience,

00:27:17.013 --> 00:27:20.209
now all nonsense going around us, better tell them.

00:27:20.409 --> 00:27:25.641
Or are we going to allow all of them to go to hell direct?

00:27:25.841 --> 00:27:31.038
Message of Easter. East, comes from East.

00:27:31.238 --> 00:27:34.251
I don’t know why they call it Easter.

00:27:34.451 --> 00:27:37.995
Have you ever thought of it?

00:27:38.195 --> 00:27:42.003
Why do they call it a Worcester Sauce, I don’t know.

00:27:42.203 --> 00:27:44.268
I don’t know why they call anything anything.

00:27:44.468 --> 00:27:50.787
But Easter,

00:27:50.987 --> 00:27:53.599
you can’t explain, you know.

00:27:53.799 --> 00:27:57.443
Like "curved screen", you don't know.

00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:03.820
So I don't know, but Easter, it is coming from the East.

00:28:04.484 --> 00:28:10.362
The wisdom has to come from the East, the
Resurrection has to come from the East,

00:28:10.562 --> 00:28:14.713
whether they like it or not.

00:28:16.252 --> 00:28:19.443
And that is the message of Easter today:

00:28:19.643 --> 00:28:24.368
that let us give them the chance of resurrection

00:28:24.568 --> 00:28:27.829
by talking to them, all of you.

00:28:28.029 --> 00:28:30.026
Should make it a point, go and talk to people

00:28:30.227 --> 00:28:33.792
who are in charge of theology, churches, Bibles.

00:28:33.992 --> 00:28:37.492
Go and talk to them, tell them:"What are you doing? Are you mad?

00:28:37.693 --> 00:28:40.940
Why you want to die? Why do you want to be sleep people.

00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:46.239
You don’t know anything."

00:28:47.574 --> 00:28:51.164
Another thing I would suggest that we should have regular classes,

00:28:51.364 --> 00:28:53.867
to understand Sahaja Yoga properly.

00:28:54.067 --> 00:28:57.012
I have seen some people who are Sahaja Yogis for years

00:28:57.212 --> 00:29:03.754
don’t know anything about Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:03.954 --> 00:29:06.348
Even in Bombay, people told that:

00:29:06.548 --> 00:29:10.539
"Some of the ladies are absolutely zero as far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned.

00:29:10.739 --> 00:29:12.754
They don’t understand what is Sahaja Yoga is,

00:29:12.955 --> 00:29:17.466
they don’t understand what is - what are the chakras are.

00:29:17.666 --> 00:29:20.115
They listen to your lecture, everything, and then like a bubble,

00:29:20.315 --> 00:29:22.584
the whole thing disappears from their minds."

00:29:22.784 --> 00:29:25.716
I don’t know who gave them these ideas, but they were quite shocked.

00:29:25.916 --> 00:29:29.060
So let us have a class-like thing for Sahaja Yogis

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:33.758
to different topics and subjects, let us work it out.

00:29:33.958 --> 00:29:38.352
Recently you must be knowing, there is a book going to be published by

00:29:38.552 --> 00:29:42.426
Yogi Mahajan called ‘Gita Enlightened’ which is a very good book.

00:29:42.626 --> 00:29:46.682
Of course, I mean, most of it, I have helped him, he has been with me and all that,

00:29:46.883 --> 00:29:50.463
but doesn’t matter, but he has understood
the subject. The other day they published

00:29:50.664 --> 00:29:54.047
a very beautiful book in Marathi.

00:29:54.247 --> 00:29:57.726
One Suravkar, such a learned book he wrote

00:29:57.926 --> 00:30:02.570
that in the light of Gyaneshwara, what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:02.770 --> 00:30:08.048
And he has written it so well that anybody who is a theologian

00:30:08.249 --> 00:30:12.549
or anything, like in India, will be impressed by it.

00:30:12.749 --> 00:30:15.385
I wish I could translate that book for you.

00:30:15.585 --> 00:30:21.266
But it is all the stanzas from Gyaneshwara,

00:30:21.466 --> 00:30:26.005
which is in Marathi language. He
wrote such a nice book on Sahaja Yoga

00:30:26.205 --> 00:30:29.445
and that is what he gave on my birthday this time,

00:30:29.645 --> 00:30:34.734
something so substantial, I felt.

00:30:34.934 --> 00:30:38.315
And once it reaches into the hands of any one of these people,

00:30:38.515 --> 00:30:43.961
I mean, it will in any case.

00:30:44.906 --> 00:30:48.342
And he published himself, he brought some copies, gave it to me.

00:30:48.542 --> 00:30:51.178
And all the copies were sold out in that programme,

00:30:51.378 --> 00:30:56.432
every copy was sold out for Rs. 2 each.

00:30:58.060 --> 00:31:01.298
So this is what we have to do now, is to write,

00:31:01.498 --> 00:31:03.938
write to different magazines, meet people,

00:31:04.138 --> 00:31:06.212
tell them we want to come and talk to you.

00:31:06.412 --> 00:31:08.821
First of all you must know about Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:09.021 --> 00:31:11.021
You should be well equipped.

00:31:11.222 --> 00:31:15.110
It’s not that you can show my photograph with a light here.

00:31:15.310 --> 00:31:20.941
That is not sufficient. What is the light here, also you have to show.

00:31:21.141 --> 00:31:23.375
Only a few people know what is Sahaja Yoga,

00:31:23.576 --> 00:31:26.839
the rest of you don't know anything.

00:31:27.039 --> 00:31:30.240
Let us see what questions we have in our minds.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:35.756
Let us sit down and find out: "What are the questions?"

00:31:35.956 --> 00:31:38.029
"What questions are we lacking in?"

00:31:38.230 --> 00:31:41.204
"What we have to understand in Sahaja Yoga? What part we don’t know?"

00:31:41.404 --> 00:31:45.161
Let’s find out all those things, all the details. Let us write it down.

00:31:45.362 --> 00:31:50.207
Everyone of you. Whether it’s a woman, man, child, everyone can do it.

00:31:50.407 --> 00:31:53.121
Find out: "What are the questions

00:31:53.321 --> 00:31:56.313
which are not yet answered in Sahaja Yoga?"

00:31:56.513 --> 00:32:00.883
"How can we answer particular questions?"

00:32:01.083 --> 00:32:03.641
Alright? All these things can be found out.

00:32:03.841 --> 00:32:07.680
If you put your attention to it, you can easily find out what you need.

00:32:07.880 --> 00:32:11.352
Everyone has to do it. You must all be equipped.

00:32:11.553 --> 00:32:13.720
If anybody asks you a question on Sahaja Yoga

00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.775
and you cannot answer, I mean, how can you convince people?

00:32:17.975 --> 00:32:22.228
You take one ordinary so-called layman from Christianity,

00:32:22.428 --> 00:32:24.428
so-called Christianity again,

00:32:24.629 --> 00:32:28.700
the man is layman and the Christianity is also lay.

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:33.523
He will give you a big lecture on Christ.

00:32:33.723 --> 00:32:36.304
Every verse in the Bible, he will tell you:

00:32:36.504 --> 00:32:42.328
"Chapters, Matthew 2, Verse 2, this is what Christ has said.

00:32:42.528 --> 00:32:45.994
That "you will be calling me Christ, Christ and I will not recognise you",

00:32:46.194 --> 00:32:51.796
telling about himself only.

00:32:54.916 --> 00:32:58.599
So you have to be absolutely equipped for it.

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:01.185
Now you have to also know what you will confront

00:33:01.385 --> 00:33:03.943
in a particular country. For example, when I come to England,

00:33:04.143 --> 00:33:08.668
I know I have to confront these theologians and the Christ and everything.

00:33:08.869 --> 00:33:11.377
If I go to India, what I have to confront I know.

00:33:11.578 --> 00:33:17.921
I have to face it on different lines and different fronts.

00:33:18.133 --> 00:33:20.275
You don’t have to do that.

00:33:20.476 --> 00:33:22.883
Just think about your own country. For French, you have to think

00:33:23.083 --> 00:33:27.820
about France, you people have to think about this country.

00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:30.020
And then go ahead with it.

00:33:30.221 --> 00:33:34.174
You can chalk out a good programme and work it out properly.

00:33:34.374 --> 00:33:36.586
I am sure, by God’s grace, everything will work out.

00:33:36.786 --> 00:33:39.662
Because when I am going to do it now?

00:33:39.862 --> 00:33:42.201
I’m going away, as I told you, to India,

00:33:42.401 --> 00:33:45.279
and I don’t know when will I be back. You wanted to arrange

00:33:45.479 --> 00:33:49.961
my programme in England, but I think I cannot do it,

00:33:50.161 --> 00:33:52.782
because I have to go round to all the places, Europe and all that,

00:33:52.982 --> 00:33:57.024
finish that. You’d better do that touring.

00:33:57.224 --> 00:34:04.066
When I was not here, what touring did you do?

00:34:06.141 --> 00:34:09.250
Nothing.

00:34:10.925 --> 00:34:15.740
You could have toured. Now at least, these three months,

00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:18.983
when we are having a nice summer time,

00:34:19.183 --> 00:34:21.642
I’ll be travelling all over Europe, everywhere.

00:34:21.842 --> 00:34:24.892
You please see that you go round England.

00:34:25.092 --> 00:34:28.095
Visit different places, arrange programmes, talk to people,

00:34:28.295 --> 00:34:31.012
find out who are the big Johnnies there.

00:34:31.212 --> 00:34:37.754
The mayors, this, that, go and talk to them, tell them about this.

00:34:37.954 --> 00:34:41.266
That is how new programming should be done and a new dimension

00:34:41.466 --> 00:34:45.014
should be given to our Sahaja Yoga propaganda.

00:34:45.214 --> 00:34:49.302
You have done no propaganda in the right sense, in the sense that

00:34:49.503 --> 00:34:52.755
we were not so much sure about it, that we’ll work out.

00:34:52.956 --> 00:34:55.987
But now we will, because people are writing,

00:34:56.187 --> 00:35:00.906
there is an atmosphere against Christ, so we have to fight.

00:35:01.106 --> 00:35:07.195
And that is how we should become the people who are fighting for Christ.

00:35:07.395 --> 00:35:11.307
Now there could be areas where you can talk of integration,

00:35:11.507 --> 00:35:15.526
of talking about how we do not know much about Christ.

00:35:15.726 --> 00:35:18.698
That we have to go to other books to find out who He was.

00:35:18.898 --> 00:35:21.849
Why did He come on this earth? We have to go much deeper.

00:35:22.049 --> 00:35:24.036
We have to prove that there is Divine power.

00:35:24.236 --> 00:35:27.090
And you have seen how Divine power works, what wonders there are.

00:35:27.291 --> 00:35:30.025
You take my photographs. Show them: "These are the photographs,

00:35:30.226 --> 00:35:33.999
can you explain these things? That in the hand you see the sun?

00:35:34.200 --> 00:35:41.719
Show us in Mrs. Thatcher’s hand, even a star won’t twinkle."

00:35:43.828 --> 00:35:48.128
These things are to be seen in the right perspective

00:35:48.328 --> 00:35:52.865
and at the right time. We must do whatever is right at that point.

00:35:53.065 --> 00:35:55.072
That is the way Sahaja Yoga is.

00:35:55.273 --> 00:35:59.854
Hit the point when it is to be hitten.

00:36:00.584 --> 00:36:03.186
If you cannot do that way, you cannot achieve it.

00:36:03.386 --> 00:36:06.214
So this is the right time for you, there are now

00:36:06.415 --> 00:36:09.866
3 months ahead of you, I would like you to see what you can do,

00:36:10.066 --> 00:36:14.852
because now the sun will be coming out,

00:36:15.052 --> 00:36:17.258
you will have a nice summer.

00:36:17.458 --> 00:36:20.914
Go ahead. But now just do not fix all your holidays

00:36:21.114 --> 00:36:25.409
during these three months going to some beach somewhere.

00:36:25.609 --> 00:36:29.933
Sahaja Yogis have no time. They are busy people.

00:36:30.133 --> 00:36:33.804
They have no time to waste.

00:36:34.004 --> 00:36:42.759
We are on a warpath, we have no time
to quarrel among ourselves, fight.

00:36:42.959 --> 00:36:47.189
We have to fight very great enemies.

00:36:47.389 --> 00:36:50.786
We have no time to waste on our families and our children

00:36:50.986 --> 00:36:54.926
and our relations and father, mother, sister, brother.

00:36:55.126 --> 00:36:58.848
We are on a warpath, very important it is.

00:36:59.048 --> 00:37:04.618
So let us now prepare ourselves.
As Christ stood out of that grave,

00:37:04.819 --> 00:37:11.826
let us get out of this grave of lethargy, of compromising, of comfort,

00:37:12.026 --> 00:37:18.539
of our past ideas about life’s pleasures.

00:37:20.391 --> 00:37:24.851
This is the new era that has to show,

00:37:25.052 --> 00:37:29.780
it’s manifestation in this country.

00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:32.452
It is very important, and you all can do it.

00:37:32.652 --> 00:37:36.463
You have to be very brave, you have to be sensible, wise,

00:37:36.663 --> 00:37:39.946
kind and also forthright.

00:37:40.147 --> 00:37:44.041
But you have to say what you have to say, because it has to be said.

00:37:44.241 --> 00:37:48.244
And this is the only thing to be said, nothing else is important.

00:37:48.444 --> 00:37:51.354
Whatever these people talk about has no meaning.

00:37:51.554 --> 00:37:55.487
They are not mantras.

00:37:55.687 --> 00:37:59.119
Some of them are anti-God, some may not be,

00:37:59.319 --> 00:38:03.612
but they are useless, wasteful, garbages I should say.

00:38:03.812 --> 00:38:08.889
Why they are given so much importance and not the real thing that is there?

00:38:09.089 --> 00:38:17.759
You understand that this is the reality that has come into you people.

00:38:17.959 --> 00:38:21.595
Actually you have felt the reality.

00:38:21.795 --> 00:38:25.403
Actually you know the reality,

00:38:25.603 --> 00:38:31.368
you are in the reality, then why not talk about it?

00:38:33.173 --> 00:38:35.093
Why should we not?

00:38:35.293 --> 00:38:40.734
Is it not the most important thing that we have to do?

00:38:40.934 --> 00:38:43.687
If you realise it, I am sure it will work out.

00:38:43.887 --> 00:38:47.721
With all my blessings, with all my love,

00:38:47.921 --> 00:38:50.924
I really command you to do that now.

00:38:51.124 --> 00:38:55.865
May God bless you.

00:38:59.633 --> 00:39:02.316
Today, on this day you all should vow,

00:39:02.516 --> 00:39:06.066
vow that "we are on the warpath and we are going to find out

00:39:06.266 --> 00:39:08.331
ways and methods of doing these things,

00:39:08.532 --> 00:39:13.592
for these three months, we are going to work it out". Just vow.

00:39:13.792 --> 00:39:20.865
Just ask for wisdoms and the spiritual power, that’s all.

00:39:24.475 --> 00:39:32.907
And promise it to Christ that "as You did, we are going to do".

00:39:44.582 --> 00:39:49.376
May God bless you.
