00:02:50.818 --> 00:02:55.171
If you don't hear me this time please tell me.

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:00.516
I am sorry for being late,

00:03:03.322 --> 00:03:04.869
for this lecture

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:07.575
but,

00:03:09.734 --> 00:03:13.127
Dr. Warren had time to explain to you,

00:03:14.252 --> 00:03:16.252
about this experience.

00:03:16.752 --> 00:03:20.489
Sometimes it is easier to understand

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:22.989
this from a person,

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.489
who has achieved it,

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.121
than to understand from a person

00:03:28.255 --> 00:03:30.712
who is talking from some tenth storey.

00:03:32.462 --> 00:03:34.462
That's what my father told me,

00:03:34.962 --> 00:03:38.370
that if somebody's born on the tenth storey,

00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:41.860
and the rest of them are on the first floor,

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.909
if you start telling them from there they will first of all not listen,

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:48.735
nor will they understand what you see.

00:03:49.688 --> 00:03:51.688
It's not proper,

00:03:52.253 --> 00:03:57.081
that we should try to tell them something from a level,

00:03:57.775 --> 00:04:00.374
to a level, which is still there static,

00:04:00.615 --> 00:04:02.615
in their mind.

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:07.341
So one has to, raise their, consciousness,

00:04:07.841 --> 00:04:11.558
two three storeys so they start seeing that there's something beyond.

00:04:13.243 --> 00:04:16.923
But, in doing so,

00:04:18.457 --> 00:04:20.154
so many mistakes,

00:04:21.904 --> 00:04:25.486
have been, there, before,

00:04:25.577 --> 00:04:28.363
and some people have done it deliberately,

00:04:29.035 --> 00:04:31.035
some are misguided

00:04:31.147 --> 00:04:33.488
and some are doing it deliberately.

00:04:34.441 --> 00:04:36.441
Net result is just the same.

00:04:36.769 --> 00:04:40.261
Even if you give poison to someone by mistake,

00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:45.417
or in a misguided way, the result is the same.

00:04:45.917 --> 00:04:47.500
In the same way,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:50.280
whether you are misguided,

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.255
or whether you do it deliberately, whatever is wrong

00:04:54.647 --> 00:04:56.647
has an effect on the kundalini.

00:04:59.281 --> 00:05:00.764
Now the Aquarian Age,

00:05:00.876 --> 00:05:03.841
is the word I picked up from Dr. Warren,

00:05:04.255 --> 00:05:06.255
which is so true today.

00:05:06.755 --> 00:05:09.294
Aquarian means the water carrier,

00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.383
and in Sanskrit language it is called as kumbha.

00:05:13.883 --> 00:05:17.484
Kumbha is the one what we call the kundalini,

00:05:17.984 --> 00:05:20.138
the mooladhara is the kumbha,

00:05:20.875 --> 00:05:24.641
where the kundalini is there, the power of kundalini is there.

00:05:25.141 --> 00:05:27.848
So to call it an Aquarian age must be some,

00:05:28.844 --> 00:05:32.554
work of some, realized soul who could see that,

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:35.656
in this age the kundalini is going to be awakened,

00:05:35.984 --> 00:05:42.527
and that, an age will start of people getting their kundalini awakened.

00:05:44.363 --> 00:05:47.363
Now I have already talked to you the other day about

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:51.052
this second center, which is called as swadhisthana,

00:05:51.811 --> 00:05:54.073
which gives us our sustenance

00:05:54.573 --> 00:05:56.573
and also our power to create.

00:05:57.073 --> 00:05:59.667
The sustenance is created inside,

00:06:00.038 --> 00:06:02.515
that green part, which is,

00:06:04.287 --> 00:06:09.552
represented by main ten Primordial Masters,

00:06:10.052 --> 00:06:13.440
and these ten Primordial Masters had another

00:06:13.509 --> 00:06:16.786
series of masters who were called as,

00:06:16.963 --> 00:06:18.963
Disciple Principles.

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.478
Now about these people I have talked to you last time,

00:06:23.064 --> 00:06:25.577
but today I would like to speak to you

00:06:25.754 --> 00:06:29.310
about other centers, specially this nabhi,

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.829
which is the navel centre which is very important in human beings.

00:06:36.932 --> 00:06:40.139
This is the centre by which we seek.

00:06:40.553 --> 00:06:44.206
When in amoeba stage we seek,

00:06:45.496 --> 00:06:48.855
food, at a higher level

00:06:48.946 --> 00:06:51.246
we start seeking heights,

00:06:51.337 --> 00:06:54.728
like when they became mammoth and all these

00:06:55.228 --> 00:06:57.228
animals they wanted to have a height,

00:06:57.491 --> 00:07:02.277
to go over the trees to be able to master them and to eat the leaves,

00:07:02.454 --> 00:07:05.693
but they became so much outsized with their height,

00:07:05.934 --> 00:07:08.519
that they had to become smaller animals,

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:11.189
like say intelligent animals,

00:07:11.452 --> 00:07:16.194
and, like say cats and things like that, cat family.

00:07:17.599 --> 00:07:21.554
And this is how the evolution has been,

00:07:23.476 --> 00:07:27.369
brought forth through our seeking as amoeba,

00:07:27.589 --> 00:07:30.632
then as animals and now as human beings.

00:07:31.132 --> 00:07:33.856
As we have evolved higher and higher,

00:07:34.356 --> 00:07:37.536
we have become subtler and subtler in our seeking.

00:07:38.036 --> 00:07:42.155
For example the people who are seeking say power,

00:07:42.957 --> 00:07:48.260
are not so evolved as people who are seeking their spirit, no doubt about it.

00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.156
Because you have gone through that, you have had enough of it.

00:07:51.247 --> 00:07:54.083
Maybe last lives you might have been kings and queens

00:07:54.260 --> 00:07:56.522
and you must have seen all the jokes of it,

00:07:56.698 --> 00:07:58.831
so you said now, it's had enough of it,

00:07:58.922 --> 00:08:01.146
this power business, we don't want to have anymore,

00:08:01.344 --> 00:08:03.344
such a headache we don't want to have.

00:08:03.844 --> 00:08:06.565
The people who are seeking money also,

00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:09.378
are the people who have had enough of it

00:08:09.469 --> 00:08:11.856
and they were fed up of it so they said now we have had it.

00:08:12.412 --> 00:08:16.645
So now you are seekers of, something beyond.

00:08:17.274 --> 00:08:19.778
It has been always so, something beyond we seek,

00:08:20.192 --> 00:08:23.686
but this seeking beyond is not described

00:08:23.906 --> 00:08:27.495
to so many people and they are not able to understand

00:08:27.542 --> 00:08:31.297
what is the beyond, that's why this center is very important,

00:08:31.474 --> 00:08:33.474
of your evolutionary process.

00:08:36.108 --> 00:08:41.196
Now, first of all as I have told you that we have to be in balance,

00:08:41.696 --> 00:08:44.651
that's one thing we must have is the balance in life.

00:08:45.151 --> 00:08:48.225
I mean in commonsense also we can see supposing there's

00:08:48.251 --> 00:08:50.251
a car going only on one wheel,

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:52.363
how many would like to travel by that.

00:08:53.316 --> 00:08:57.189
Anything that you do in life has to have a balance,

00:08:57.258 --> 00:09:01.829
otherwise, anything, even catching something, holding something

00:09:02.329 --> 00:09:07.408
or, small small things, even riding a bicycle

00:09:07.455 --> 00:09:09.777
you know that you have to have a balance.

00:09:10.277 --> 00:09:12.606
So if the kundalini has to move,

00:09:12.697 --> 00:09:15.304
you have to be a balanced personality,

00:09:15.502 --> 00:09:17.502
a personality with a temperate,

00:09:18.002 --> 00:09:23.201
nature and must have a balanced attitude towards life.

00:09:23.701 --> 00:09:26.615
That is very important, but in case it is not,

00:09:26.706 --> 00:09:30.645
you can be sucked into the central path of the sushumna,

00:09:30.843 --> 00:09:32.843
in the central path of your evolution.

00:09:32.955 --> 00:09:36.557
Now the evolution takes place by remaining in the central path.

00:09:37.057 --> 00:09:40.054
Those who go to the extremes fall out of this.

00:09:41.696 --> 00:09:45.540
Now the virus that we suffer from very commonly,

00:09:46.126 --> 00:09:49.595
is nothing but a kind of a vegetable

00:09:49.707 --> 00:09:51.707
which is fallen out of evolution.

00:09:52.703 --> 00:09:55.580
Now the vegetable that we call as tobacco,

00:09:56.166 --> 00:10:00.516
is going to fall out of complete evolution and you'll be surprised after

00:10:01.059 --> 00:10:03.189
some years you will not find

00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.970
any tobacco growing anywhere because it will go out of evolution,

00:10:08.052 --> 00:10:12.595
thanks to human beings that they misunderstood the role of tobacco.

00:10:12.987 --> 00:10:16.022
Tobacco is an insecticide, is to be used

00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.703
for killing the insects and not to kill yourself.

00:10:20.203 --> 00:10:24.691
But, we sometimes forget, that whatever,

00:10:25.838 --> 00:10:27.838
God has created for the good,

00:10:28.015 --> 00:10:30.996
sometimes we can use it for our destruction.

00:10:31.496 --> 00:10:35.458
Same is alcohol. Alcohol was created for polishing,

00:10:35.699 --> 00:10:39.613
it's very good for example if you have to polish your crystal,

00:10:39.747 --> 00:10:41.508
you should use gin is very good,

00:10:41.599 --> 00:10:44.039
for diamonds or anything.

00:10:45.617 --> 00:10:50.361
Is just a polish, it's a polish for the,

00:10:50.458 --> 00:10:54.288
for anything, it gives a polish. You see alcohol is a polish and

00:10:54.364 --> 00:10:58.533
its composition is such that it gives a polish to a thing.

00:10:58.672 --> 00:11:02.483
Now God wanted you to have polished surfaces and polished things

00:11:02.644 --> 00:11:05.805
and all the clean look of it so He gave you this polish.

00:11:05.944 --> 00:11:08.674
Now you started drinking it, now what to do.

00:11:11.698 --> 00:11:15.457
He never asked you to drink, but if you drink that,

00:11:15.554 --> 00:11:18.068
then it polishes your intestines also.

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:21.940
But it has its own nature. It doesn't have any

00:11:22.185 --> 00:11:26.427
idea of morality, poor thing what, we can't blame the alcohol,

00:11:26.694 --> 00:11:30.917
because it is suppose to polish, wherever you put it it polishes all right,

00:11:31.141 --> 00:11:33.842
so it polishes your liver also nicely.

00:11:38.351 --> 00:11:41.892
And when the liver is nicely polished then what happens

00:11:41.968 --> 00:11:44.305
that the heat from the liver,

00:11:44.402 --> 00:11:48.091
which is for the expulsion from the body,

00:11:48.591 --> 00:11:51.814
it has to pass into the bloodstream, cannot because there's a,

00:11:51.953 --> 00:11:54.377
barrier and because of that barrier

00:11:54.601 --> 00:11:56.941
poor liver does not know what to do.

00:11:57.102 --> 00:12:00.599
It just goes on accumulating all the heat within it

00:12:00.717 --> 00:12:05.714
and that's how your liver goes out of circulation of anything,

00:12:06.214 --> 00:12:10.207
and you have liver problems and you feel very giddy, nauseated,

00:12:10.537 --> 00:12:14.825
and liver is the one which really cleanses your attention.

00:12:15.325 --> 00:12:18.148
Whatever you gather from your attention it cleanses.

00:12:18.521 --> 00:12:23.237
So you become horrid I mean you are all the time angry,

00:12:23.313 --> 00:12:26.783
hot-tempered, you bark at people all the time,

00:12:26.986 --> 00:12:31.612
all that thing is typically liverish you see. We grow tall,

00:12:31.751 --> 00:12:35.439
like that absolutely straight line, and

00:12:35.494 --> 00:12:38.996
you become very hot-tempered. Sometimes you could be hawk-like you know,

00:12:39.178 --> 00:12:42.131
people will be afraid of going nearer such a person,

00:12:42.419 --> 00:12:45.474
because such a person can be very dry personality

00:12:45.826 --> 00:12:47.251
and that's why you'll find,

00:12:47.369 --> 00:12:50.739
drunkard people if you they're over-drunk you go near them they'll just

00:12:50.836 --> 00:12:53.094
beat you for nothing at all. I mean

00:12:53.403 --> 00:12:55.403
it sometimes happens that by chance

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:58.877
if you go and ask some drunkard that: 'What's the time?' in the night

00:12:58.911 --> 00:13:00.062
you will have it.

00:13:00.159 --> 00:13:06.083
So, because it spoils your awareness

00:13:06.180 --> 00:13:10.230
and in that awareness a nice man also could be like that,

00:13:10.285 --> 00:13:15.004
but of course there could be a case where a person might become better.

00:13:15.165 --> 00:13:17.890
That is also another thing that can happen

00:13:17.945 --> 00:13:20.389
when you get possessed by this

00:13:20.571 --> 00:13:23.394
left-side movement because alcohol reduces

00:13:23.533 --> 00:13:26.886
your awareness and you go to the left-side movement to the left side,

00:13:27.109 --> 00:13:30.966
may give you, a feeling 'Oh I'm very much better now'

00:13:31.148 --> 00:13:35.850
and sort of you get happy because your ego is subsided and everything is

00:13:36.095 --> 00:13:39.922
alright and 'I'm really moderate now, I cannot hit anyone

00:13:39.998 --> 00:13:42.343
and let me have little bit and sleep off'.

00:13:42.525 --> 00:13:44.824
But next day there's a hangover

00:13:44.963 --> 00:13:46.963
and you feel so horrible with it,

00:13:47.039 --> 00:13:48.314
that you don't know what to do, I mean

00:13:48.407 --> 00:13:50.814
it's something, then again you want to have it in the night

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:55.425
because you want to again go to the same realm into the left side.

00:13:55.925 --> 00:14:00.126
Now this left side realm, apparently shows that there is

00:14:00.626 --> 00:14:05.513
reduction in the weight of the ego, but it does not, it wobbles.

00:14:05.711 --> 00:14:10.203
What happens that you go to the superego on the left hand side you see there,

00:14:10.401 --> 00:14:14.905
and the ego then thinks that it has gone down because the superego

00:14:14.974 --> 00:14:19.671
increases in size. But when superego increases, the ego is pushed down

00:14:19.912 --> 00:14:23.888
and then when you come to your ego condition,

00:14:23.957 --> 00:14:26.523
then it pushes down so there's a big wobbling going on,

00:14:26.614 --> 00:14:29.627
and such people get ultimately very much confused.

00:14:29.718 --> 00:14:33.082
They might end up in a lunatic asylum I don't know what they do,

00:14:33.237 --> 00:14:39.516
but, when they are even sane you can find they lose the grip over life,

00:14:39.822 --> 00:14:43.709
for example such people can become very frivolous, and

00:14:43.756 --> 00:14:46.957
cannot feel the joy of life without drinking.

00:14:47.305 --> 00:14:52.509
It's most amazing that people can't enjoy each other unless and until

00:14:52.686 --> 00:14:57.752
there's a glass in between. I mean human beings are so beautiful,

00:14:58.812 --> 00:15:03.508
and they have the capacity to enjoy each other, so much,

00:15:04.245 --> 00:15:08.420
they are the only ones who are blessed more than anybody else.

00:15:08.791 --> 00:15:11.533
But if there's a glass all the time in between

00:15:11.752 --> 00:15:14.033
then they can just bark at each other,

00:15:14.382 --> 00:15:16.382
they cannot enjoy each other.

00:15:17.033 --> 00:15:20.655
The enjoyment should be complete when there's nothing in between.

00:15:21.651 --> 00:15:24.265
Now this is what I was telling you, this nahbi chakra.

00:15:24.765 --> 00:15:30.135
This nahbi chakra gets, ruined also when we take to,

00:15:30.441 --> 00:15:33.685
alcohols or serious things like that, drugs and,

00:15:33.905 --> 00:15:36.336
even I've seen certain medicines can spoil this.

00:15:36.771 --> 00:15:40.096
Then you get a problem with the other things like digestion,

00:15:40.337 --> 00:15:43.674
you get constipation, all sorts of things take place,

00:15:43.829 --> 00:15:44.983
by which you develop

00:15:45.186 --> 00:15:48.682
gas troubles and other troubles and then your heart troubles and it

00:15:48.751 --> 00:15:50.860
goes on one after another.

00:15:50.930 --> 00:15:53.953
I do not say that it's only alcohol that will cause.

00:15:54.173 --> 00:15:58.370
There are other causes also, but alcohol can never be helpful,

00:15:58.676 --> 00:16:01.850
in giving you good health. Some people

00:16:01.941 --> 00:16:05.300
have a feeling that if you take alcohol then only you will keep good health.

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:09.291
Is a wrong thing. Because health is not only physical health.

00:16:09.489 --> 00:16:12.784
It's also mental health. People think that

00:16:13.071 --> 00:16:15.269
physical health is the end of everything,

00:16:15.337 --> 00:16:20.445
is absolutely wrong because we are not only the physical being.

00:16:21.139 --> 00:16:24.367
We are also the mental being and the emotional being.

00:16:24.630 --> 00:16:27.298
And when you play too much with your nahbi chakra

00:16:27.496 --> 00:16:30.294
you have the biggest problem and that is that

00:16:30.471 --> 00:16:33.943
you can never be successful in life

00:16:34.077 --> 00:16:37.522
as far as enjoyment is concerned, of your achievements.

00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:40.965
For example a person becomes rich,

00:16:41.271 --> 00:16:43.877
unduly rich he becomes, is a blessing

00:16:43.992 --> 00:16:46.595
I should say of nahbi chakra on the right-hand side.

00:16:47.375 --> 00:16:52.439
Right-hand side nahbi chakra can give you a lot of wealth,

00:16:52.637 --> 00:16:57.941
a lot of money and you'll have ten cars and fifteen people attending to you,

00:16:58.032 --> 00:17:01.349
everything you may have but, it cannot,

00:17:01.849 --> 00:17:04.618
it cannot give you the satisfaction of life.

00:17:05.765 --> 00:17:10.424
You will go on accumulating and end up with a suicide or something like that

00:17:10.558 --> 00:17:12.558
and you would not know why you are

00:17:12.735 --> 00:17:14.388
bent upon committing suicide.

00:17:14.546 --> 00:17:16.888
That's why in all affluent countries you find

00:17:17.194 --> 00:17:19.194
people are planning to commit suicide

00:17:19.285 --> 00:17:21.963
and the more affluent they are the worse it is.

00:17:23.131 --> 00:17:26.116
But the left side gets completely dried.

00:17:26.379 --> 00:17:30.299
Now the left side is the centre of

00:17:30.476 --> 00:17:32.476
the family life, the Gruhalaxshmi,

00:17:32.545 --> 00:17:34.545
the Goddess of the family,

00:17:35.648 --> 00:17:37.648
the household you see.

00:17:37.976 --> 00:17:40.425
A person who runs after money too much,

00:17:40.925 --> 00:17:44.565
forgets his family. He has no time for his family.

00:17:44.742 --> 00:17:47.115
The husband and wife may meet somewhere

00:17:47.206 --> 00:17:48.689
on the airport

00:17:48.844 --> 00:17:52.472
or may just wave at each other sometimes you see, crossing each other,

00:17:52.735 --> 00:17:54.735
or the children suffer the most.

00:17:55.235 --> 00:17:58.583
And in that case the women also then take up with the men,

00:17:58.674 --> 00:18:03.502
they compete what's wrong, they start copying men,

00:18:03.679 --> 00:18:05.679
and in so doing so,

00:18:05.770 --> 00:18:07.770
when they compete with each other,

00:18:07.817 --> 00:18:11.619
then what happens, that this family life gets disturbed.

00:18:12.119 --> 00:18:15.089
The woman of the household is dissatisfied,

00:18:15.201 --> 00:18:18.085
her ego is not satisfied. In olden times

00:18:18.262 --> 00:18:20.262
the man used to go in the jungle,

00:18:20.439 --> 00:18:23.067
and get all the wood cut, bring it home,

00:18:23.222 --> 00:18:25.352
and give it to the wife and wife used to cook.

00:18:25.421 --> 00:18:28.287
There was no problem because there was barter system.

00:18:28.334 --> 00:18:30.334
He could see her working in the household.

00:18:30.446 --> 00:18:32.229
Now the husband earns the money

00:18:32.276 --> 00:18:36.244
and the woman spends. I mean that also requires some work,

00:18:36.270 --> 00:18:37.652
isn't it to spend the money.

00:18:37.829 --> 00:18:41.998
But to man it looks like, that I'm the earning member and she's the spender.

00:18:42.239 --> 00:18:47.374
So she said all right, I will also earn. But in this too much of competition,

00:18:47.508 --> 00:18:50.133
too much of competition like this, between the two,

00:18:50.525 --> 00:18:53.564
what happens, the family suffers, the children suffer

00:18:53.805 --> 00:18:57.063
and such a person will have problem with the wife, the wife will have

00:18:57.154 --> 00:19:01.755
problem with the husband and you can always feel that center on this finger,

00:19:01.932 --> 00:19:05.116
if that finger is catching, that means there's something wrong

00:19:05.207 --> 00:19:07.927
with your family relationship,

00:19:08.427 --> 00:19:11.883
that you have to adjust yourself, or he has to adjust.

00:19:12.188 --> 00:19:17.012
It's an important thing. Because you are like the flowers

00:19:17.059 --> 00:19:19.059
which have to produce a fruit.

00:19:19.257 --> 00:19:20.781
That's what nature wants.

00:19:21.022 --> 00:19:23.699
Nature wants that you are there to produce the,

00:19:24.695 --> 00:19:27.719
fruit, that is your children.

00:19:28.628 --> 00:19:32.161
That's why you are men and women. That's the basics.

00:19:32.661 --> 00:19:35.296
Now, if you think that

00:19:35.365 --> 00:19:39.397
with that responsibility if you can do something else you should do.

00:19:39.509 --> 00:19:41.035
But the main thing is that,

00:19:41.061 --> 00:19:44.910
and if you don't do that, is to look after your children, to give them joy,

00:19:45.022 --> 00:19:47.022
have a beautiful nest for them,

00:19:47.134 --> 00:19:50.800
then I must say that you are neglecting your basic duty

00:19:50.891 --> 00:19:53.300
and your attention is on something else.

00:19:53.455 --> 00:19:57.348
That's why so many divorces are taking place and problems are there,

00:19:57.503 --> 00:20:00.145
the women ask for their rights, they go beyond their limits,

00:20:00.171 --> 00:20:02.840
they became dominating here, the men become dominating.

00:20:03.103 --> 00:20:04.932
That's not the way we are going to solve it.

00:20:05.109 --> 00:20:07.282
We have to know that we are two wheels,

00:20:07.437 --> 00:20:09.329
two wheels of one chariot,

00:20:09.420 --> 00:20:11.420
one on the left, another in the right.

00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:13.640
Now they are not similar,

00:20:13.881 --> 00:20:17.343
they're not similar they are two types one left side one right side.

00:20:17.692 --> 00:20:19.692
But, they are equal.

00:20:20.451 --> 00:20:23.090
In their, whatever they do it's equal,

00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.331
they are to be respected equally in the same manner.

00:20:26.615 --> 00:20:28.615
And it is always so for example,

00:20:28.662 --> 00:20:31.527
I had a girl who came to me

00:20:31.811 --> 00:20:33.811
and she was a private secretary,

00:20:34.117 --> 00:20:36.117
and she told me: 'Mother you say this,

00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:40.436
but I've seen that all these men come and flirt with their private secretaries.'

00:20:40.656 --> 00:20:44.019
So I said: 'All right, maybe so, but what does that matter.'

00:20:44.153 --> 00:20:45.950
You see that shows that's something wrong with the man, he

00:20:45.976 --> 00:20:47.780
doesn't understand, he's off his head, he

00:20:47.827 --> 00:20:50.240
cannot enjoy his wife and he's running after other things.

00:20:50.417 --> 00:20:53.026
It's like having something in your house and you are

00:20:53.224 --> 00:20:54.793
looking at other things you see.

00:20:55.099 --> 00:20:57.360
Like in India if you go to some,

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:00.269
somebody comes to your house be careful about your things,

00:21:00.403 --> 00:21:02.921
but in England I tell them, if somebody comes to your house

00:21:03.012 --> 00:21:04.997
be careful about your wife, see.

00:21:07.329 --> 00:21:09.879
Is just a little difference between,

00:21:09.991 --> 00:21:13.020
but the second one is a dangerous thing because fundamental,

00:21:13.197 --> 00:21:14.961
the wife is the fundamental thing,

00:21:15.052 --> 00:21:18.180
because you do not know what she will do, how she will react

00:21:18.313 --> 00:21:22.474
and you do not know how the guests because that is regarded as their freedom.

00:21:22.974 --> 00:21:26.297
But if you take away something from somebody's house that's not freedom,

00:21:26.388 --> 00:21:28.388
because we can take away anything from somebody's house

00:21:28.414 --> 00:21:29.961
why should anybody arrest us?

00:21:30.267 --> 00:21:33.376
Because there is a free will for you to do what you like,

00:21:33.488 --> 00:21:36.642
is allowed to do what you like, but in that free will

00:21:36.776 --> 00:21:40.384
you are harming so many people and ultimately your society.

00:21:40.884 --> 00:21:43.635
Now these two wheels, as I said,

00:21:43.941 --> 00:21:46.376
are very important to God,

00:21:47.242 --> 00:21:51.511
because so many great people want to take birth on this earth.

00:21:52.356 --> 00:21:55.658
So many great souls want to take birth on this earth,

00:21:56.158 --> 00:21:58.158
and if we behave in such a manner,

00:21:58.529 --> 00:22:02.459
that all the time this chariot is this way going up and that way going up,

00:22:02.571 --> 00:22:05.161
I can tell you no child would be willing

00:22:05.274 --> 00:22:07.586
to be born in this place who are great people.

00:22:07.626 --> 00:22:11.984
Only the people who are of the worst type will be born,

00:22:12.053 --> 00:22:16.549
they'll be hooligans, they'll be horrible people with a horrid nature

00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:20.008
and they'll spoil the whole atmosphere of the countries

00:22:20.142 --> 00:22:23.772
where husband wife have, do not have good relationship.

00:22:24.272 --> 00:22:26.272
The children will be such hooligans

00:22:26.384 --> 00:22:28.384
and such horrible things

00:22:28.431 --> 00:22:33.117
that you'll be surprised that at the age of eight years and five years

00:22:33.229 --> 00:22:34.989
they'll be committing murders and doing

00:22:35.080 --> 00:22:37.699
all kinds of such thing that you'll be shocked.

00:22:39.406 --> 00:22:41.406
Now between you and me,

00:22:41.669 --> 00:22:44.205
because you are also husbands and wife and,

00:22:44.512 --> 00:22:46.705
one thing it should be there that

00:22:47.205 --> 00:22:50.959
we should not quarrel before our children.

00:22:51.567 --> 00:22:55.512
We should have all decency of husband and wife, there are so many things

00:22:55.581 --> 00:22:57.753
we do not do in the presence of our children.

00:22:57.951 --> 00:23:00.443
In the same way we need not sit down and

00:23:00.517 --> 00:23:02.943
quarrel and say: 'I hate you and I hate you'.

00:23:03.314 --> 00:23:07.361
I tell you this is something you have to change little bit in our language.

00:23:07.495 --> 00:23:09.823
In India if somebody says: 'I hate you'

00:23:09.935 --> 00:23:12.787
it's regarded, that man regarded as a most unmannerly person.

00:23:12.834 --> 00:23:16.454
I mean its very bad manners to say 'I hate you' how,

00:23:16.566 --> 00:23:19.842
I mean it shows that you are very low type of person to say like that.

00:23:20.342 --> 00:23:21.544
But 'I hate you' so what.

00:23:22.522 --> 00:23:24.044
If you hate so what, you are not God.

00:23:24.716 --> 00:23:26.716
If you hate me what does it matter, actually,

00:23:27.388 --> 00:23:29.388
if somebody hates someone, so what.

00:23:29.802 --> 00:23:34.283
That shows that person is not a good person, just to hate someone.

00:23:34.524 --> 00:23:38.418
'I hate you' is a way of expressing something

00:23:38.616 --> 00:23:44.177
that is I feel, is very wrong for the family system. It shocks children.

00:23:44.677 --> 00:23:47.639
Children look upon you as ideals.

00:23:47.747 --> 00:23:49.542
When they are born you should see them,

00:23:49.781 --> 00:23:52.753
most of the children nowadays in Australia are born realized,

00:23:52.787 --> 00:23:56.111
I see them around when I went to the airport and I see they're born realized.

00:23:56.368 --> 00:23:58.368
And they watch you, and they're surprised

00:23:58.476 --> 00:24:00.476
and they sulk and they feel very sad.

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.303
They don't like, they don't take sides,

00:24:02.355 --> 00:24:04.935
they don't like the father to fight the mother, the mother to fight.

00:24:05.323 --> 00:24:09.098
And one other thing which you must understand,

00:24:09.316 --> 00:24:11.598
that a certain gradation has to be there.

00:24:12.098 --> 00:24:14.759
A woman is the strongest point of the household.

00:24:15.222 --> 00:24:16.805
Like this Mother Earth is.

00:24:16.969 --> 00:24:19.658
She takes all the problems upon Herself.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:21.916
She, because She's the strongest.

00:24:22.173 --> 00:24:25.994
Who else can withstand this kind of, weight on Her.

00:24:26.251 --> 00:24:27.665
It's the Mother only can do that.

00:24:27.941 --> 00:24:30.769
In the same way a woman in the house is the mother,

00:24:31.008 --> 00:24:32.490
and she has to bear.

00:24:32.803 --> 00:24:34.485
You see it's nice to have a husband

00:24:34.556 --> 00:24:36.762
who comes home and says whatever he likes

00:24:36.852 --> 00:24:38.852
and takes out all the filth on you,

00:24:39.072 --> 00:24:41.800
than to have a husband who is very sweet, hello, hello

00:24:41.946 --> 00:24:45.412
and outside he goes like a bumptious tiger on everyone.

00:24:46.714 --> 00:24:52.022
Such a man is, has to be, he has to, you see they're like children I would say,

00:24:52.522 --> 00:24:56.377
they are like children. They have to take out their tensions on their wives only,

00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:58.748
and you should be an absorber of that

00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:00.349
and that's the sign of a woman.

00:25:00.457 --> 00:25:03.954
A strong woman doesn't get easily disturbed by these things.

00:25:04.137 --> 00:25:06.137
She's not bothered. She says all right,

00:25:06.208 --> 00:25:07.526
you little baby come along,

00:25:07.672 --> 00:25:10.084
now I have had four babies, now this is the fifth one

00:25:10.136 --> 00:25:11.721
which is the smallest has come.

00:25:11.885 --> 00:25:14.685
Let him shout and scream, even with the children,

00:25:14.775 --> 00:25:17.649
you have to be patient, they'll hit you, they'll do anything.

00:25:17.906 --> 00:25:20.243
I would say that way in India, children are treated

00:25:20.351 --> 00:25:22.351
very kindly and they are special things.

00:25:22.497 --> 00:25:24.648
They will do what they like when they are children,

00:25:24.849 --> 00:25:27.335
but when they grow up we do not have teenage problem,

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.967
we do not have problem where the children don't respect.

00:25:30.896 --> 00:25:32.896
In that, this is very important

00:25:33.676 --> 00:25:36.070
aspect of our modern life

00:25:36.122 --> 00:25:40.386
that we have to understand, what is the relationship of husband and wife is.

00:25:40.699 --> 00:25:45.482
Husband is like say, a gentleman who

00:25:45.532 --> 00:25:48.383
is definitely is to be respected by the wife.

00:25:48.435 --> 00:25:51.202
But if she does not respect the husband she cannot

00:25:51.292 --> 00:25:52.772
get respect from her children.

00:25:53.029 --> 00:25:55.029
But the husband has to be respectable man,

00:25:55.212 --> 00:25:58.526
that's very important. If the man is not respectable, he

00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:00.128
cannot be respected easily.

00:26:00.180 --> 00:26:03.259
But the more is the woman has to be very respectable,

00:26:03.983 --> 00:26:05.983
if she doesn't give her respect,

00:26:06.184 --> 00:26:08.184
you can handle any kind of man

00:26:08.236 --> 00:26:12.625
if you are clever enough, drunkards, all sorts, they come round.

00:26:13.125 --> 00:26:15.843
Because after all they're human beings, they're not bad people.

00:26:16.343 --> 00:26:19.565
But because of mishandling they just get out

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:23.104
and the domination of men is just a myth.

00:26:23.417 --> 00:26:25.568
See, they cannot dominate,

00:26:25.788 --> 00:26:29.328
they're incapable of domination. They just do it because they want to

00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:31.380
feel that they are superior, that's all.

00:26:31.581 --> 00:26:34.658
But they cannot dominate. Whatever domination, what is their domination,

00:26:34.710 --> 00:26:36.300
is little little things here and there.

00:26:36.427 --> 00:26:38.427
Just like children, that's what it is.

00:26:38.591 --> 00:26:42.113
If women understand their maturity and their,

00:26:42.893 --> 00:26:46.249
their responsibility as women, because they are the shakti,

00:26:46.562 --> 00:26:48.562
they are the power of the family,

00:26:48.726 --> 00:26:53.906
and they are the potent shakti for the husband as well as for the children,

00:26:54.201 --> 00:26:56.464
but if they get disturbed

00:26:56.610 --> 00:26:59.312
then the husband is disturbed and children are also disturbed.

00:26:59.513 --> 00:27:02.676
But they are potent, while the kinetics are these people.

00:27:02.766 --> 00:27:04.766
Like here is the electricity, all right,

00:27:04.912 --> 00:27:07.435
so we say very good, lamp and electricity and all that,

00:27:07.581 --> 00:27:10.423
but from where does it come. The source is somewhere

00:27:10.569 --> 00:27:12.569
quietly sending the source,

00:27:12.714 --> 00:27:15.069
and enjoying itself by giving that source.

00:27:15.345 --> 00:27:17.731
In the same way this is a very important centre.

00:27:17.990 --> 00:27:21.183
Why I said it because today I went,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:26.889
went to Melbourne and all the time this finger was burning up to this point.

00:27:27.389 --> 00:27:29.146
So that means there's something wrong with

00:27:29.202 --> 00:27:32.276
men and women as far as their family life is concerned.

00:27:32.496 --> 00:27:34.214
They're all very upset I felt.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:36.138
The husband is upset and the women.

00:27:36.265 --> 00:27:38.906
Maybe the laws maybe against men, maybe here

00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:40.940
I don't know. But in America I found

00:27:41.141 --> 00:27:43.717
a husband and wife relationship is very queer.

00:27:43.937 --> 00:27:47.314
For example I met a lady, very queer people they are.

00:27:49.186 --> 00:27:52.597
I went and stayed with a lady she had a luxurious house

00:27:52.649 --> 00:27:55.136
with a swimming pool and this and that,

00:27:55.189 --> 00:27:59.783
a maid in coming to do everything up and five storeys and this,

00:28:00.749 --> 00:28:04.491
and she said: 'You see my, one of my former husbands

00:28:04.543 --> 00:28:08.662
will come and see you in Los Angeles.' I said: 'All right very good idea'.

00:28:09.162 --> 00:28:12.560
So he came, he was like a pauper you know walking like this,

00:28:12.834 --> 00:28:16.516
and he says: 'I have got a room on rents where I'm staying Mother,

00:28:16.755 --> 00:28:19.586
 it's very difficult, I have to share it with someone'. I said: 'What?

00:28:20.291 --> 00:28:22.291
That lady who was there,

00:28:22.492 --> 00:28:25.715
she has a very big house, she's supposed to be your wife'.

00:28:25.805 --> 00:28:29.701
He said: 'That's mine, I tell you, I lost it to her in a case'.

00:28:29.809 --> 00:28:32.089
I said: 'How could you lose that in a case?'

00:28:32.197 --> 00:28:35.157
'Because she asked for a divorce and because

00:28:35.247 --> 00:28:38.526
she found guilty out of me something some,

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:42.060
so she got it'. And she married three husbands, all the three husbands

00:28:42.261 --> 00:28:44.932
are moving like paupers, and this lady's very rich.

00:28:48.174 --> 00:28:51.597
If you marry seven husbands, seven husbands are finished forever

00:28:51.687 --> 00:28:55.087
but the lady is so rich, seven times more than any one of them.

00:28:55.774 --> 00:28:58.094
So this is kind of a law I don't understand.

00:28:58.296 --> 00:29:00.505
First of all why there should be a law, I don't understand,

00:29:00.539 --> 00:29:02.031
between husband and wife.

00:29:02.083 --> 00:29:05.809
I just don't understand. I mean we don't have such laws in India but

00:29:05.936 --> 00:29:07.713
everybody cares for the wife,

00:29:07.821 --> 00:29:11.098
because she is the nearest and the dearest person they have.

00:29:11.430 --> 00:29:15.243
Who else to depend? If the woman is dedicated and devoted to husband,

00:29:15.743 --> 00:29:19.225
do you think he'll run after any other woman, he has to come back to her.

00:29:19.482 --> 00:29:21.509
You see he'll be so fed up with these

00:29:21.647 --> 00:29:23.993
women who just live for money or anything

00:29:24.239 --> 00:29:25.304
and he has to come back.

00:29:25.487 --> 00:29:28.600
So you see one has to take a very wise decision,

00:29:28.690 --> 00:29:31.561
because you must understand you are born at a juncture,

00:29:32.565 --> 00:29:36.720
whether in, on which you will be destroyed completely,

00:29:37.407 --> 00:29:40.608
or you'll be saved completely. Is a very important thing.

00:29:41.518 --> 00:29:43.994
You have to save humanity. You are born

00:29:44.029 --> 00:29:46.756
at a time when you have to save humanity.

00:29:47.144 --> 00:29:49.762
It's not only kundalini awakening

00:29:50.001 --> 00:29:52.115
that will help, because you might be saved,

00:29:52.205 --> 00:29:53.982
but you have to save the whole society,

00:29:54.239 --> 00:29:56.948
the whole family, the whole,

00:29:58.325 --> 00:30:00.476
I should say the whole universe or the whole

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:03.547
creation will have no meaning if you people are destroyed.

00:30:03.842 --> 00:30:06.434
Now you, this is one of the way of destruction,

00:30:06.710 --> 00:30:09.519
 by destroying the family. The children become mad,

00:30:09.571 --> 00:30:10.815
the husband becomes mad,

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:13.527
they all end up in orphanages, that's what I've seen,

00:30:13.579 --> 00:30:15.854
they are mostly in orphanages in their old age,

00:30:15.896 --> 00:30:17.528
there's nobody to bother about you.

00:30:18.209 --> 00:30:21.703
So it's a question of giving, and giving and giving.

00:30:23.043 --> 00:30:27.334
Now this Gruhalaxshmi's centre is on the left-hand side,

00:30:27.834 --> 00:30:31.263
and the another is Raja Laxshmi centre is on the right-hand side.

00:30:31.566 --> 00:30:36.228
Now this center gives us the power to rule over people

00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:39.993
and we become very, in extremes you see we can become very arrogant

00:30:40.104 --> 00:30:45.360
 and we can become very very, sort of authoritative and we might,

00:30:45.431 --> 00:30:50.290
sort of end up with a funeral with ten thousand people behind us,

00:30:50.361 --> 00:30:55.939
all bought from market and put there behind you without any feelings,

00:30:56.010 --> 00:30:59.393
that's all finished. With such a man finished they'll say, oh thank God he died,

00:30:59.635 --> 00:31:02.213
he was a horrible terror for us.

00:31:03.528 --> 00:31:06.846
So, that kind of a life can come with Raja Laxshmi.

00:31:06.917 --> 00:31:09.674
But in the center is the Laxshmi.

00:31:11.354 --> 00:31:16.476
Laxshmi is the Goddess, is the power within us, by which we balance,

00:31:16.783 --> 00:31:18.783
lead a very balanced life,

00:31:19.283 --> 00:31:21.283
by which we are satisfied.

00:31:21.783 --> 00:31:24.704
Now they have made a beautiful picture of this Laxshmi also one

00:31:24.736 --> 00:31:27.698
should understand this power is a Lady,

00:31:27.812 --> 00:31:31.950
is a Mother and She stands on a lotus. Now these are all symbols

00:31:32.042 --> 00:31:34.042
which suggest that,

00:31:34.542 --> 00:31:40.055
these symbols are carved out with such deep significance.

00:31:40.297 --> 00:31:45.013
She stands on a lotus. Means imagine, who can stand on a lotus?

00:31:45.363 --> 00:31:50.013
And She's a very healthy woman, very healthy woman and She stands on a lotus.

00:31:50.234 --> 00:31:54.866
It means that, that She is never putting pressure on anyone.

00:31:55.409 --> 00:31:58.793
A rich man comes in, he must honk his car,

00:32:00.087 --> 00:32:03.214
loudly, because he's rich so he thinks he must honk it higher,

00:32:03.714 --> 00:32:08.516
and a rich man must go in a big limousine or some sort of

00:32:08.553 --> 00:32:10.907
a thing to show off that he's very rich.

00:32:10.978 --> 00:32:13.903
If he comes to any program, or any he must sit in front,

00:32:14.017 --> 00:32:15.847
he should have the front seat,

00:32:15.918 --> 00:32:19.399
and he makes him known everywhere everybody must feel

00:32:19.405 --> 00:32:22.536
the weight of the rich man. He can run away with ten wives,

00:32:22.714 --> 00:32:25.998
of somebody and, he can have a big

00:32:26.391 --> 00:32:30.019
boat for himself, and he can get any number of women there

00:32:30.068 --> 00:32:33.115
and he can spoil any families he likes because he's rich.

00:32:33.894 --> 00:32:38.320
This kind of thing comes in in people but Laxshmi the One who has,

00:32:38.434 --> 00:32:40.434
stands on the lotus,

00:32:40.934 --> 00:32:45.280
is the beauty and the glory of the riches,

00:32:45.351 --> 00:32:47.794
that God has given that person.

00:32:48.294 --> 00:32:53.537
Then, it has got two red, pink flowers in the hand, that are

00:32:53.651 --> 00:32:58.626
lotus flowers again. Now the lotus is regarded as a very

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:04.192
holy flower in India, because it is so receptive

00:33:04.306 --> 00:33:09.505
to everything that is crude and funny. First of all

00:33:09.576 --> 00:33:12.938
it is born in the mud. Just think of it,

00:33:13.438 --> 00:33:17.862
in the mud, in the filth, where the horrible smell is coming out,

00:33:18.126 --> 00:33:19.165
the lotus is born.

00:33:20.094 --> 00:33:24.262
And the one lotus gives the fragrance, the beautiful fragrance

00:33:24.333 --> 00:33:25.541
to the whole atmosphere,

00:33:25.655 --> 00:33:28.373
and kills all that's filth and everything,

00:33:28.465 --> 00:33:31.875
and covers the whole pond with its big big leaves

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.885
so that it looks a beautiful pond.

00:33:36.029 --> 00:33:39.496
That's what is the lotus for. But this lotus

00:33:39.588 --> 00:33:44.561
is a pink lotus, means pink, you know is the sign of love.

00:33:44.889 --> 00:33:48.268
Pink is the sign of love. So such a person has to have

00:33:48.446 --> 00:33:51.795
tremendous love and that softness of the lotus.

00:33:52.295 --> 00:33:55.628
Now the inside of the lotus is very soft and nice

00:33:55.849 --> 00:34:01.051
and a, I don't know what do you call that, the bee, the black bee,

00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:06.309
a very big one which has got horrible,

00:34:07.517 --> 00:34:11.807
no, the black bee, it's like that, which has got

00:34:11.899 --> 00:34:15.372
angular legs and things like that, horrible, you cannot touch it.

00:34:15.572 --> 00:34:18.868
That one, can find its place in the lotus.

00:34:19.154 --> 00:34:23.589
When it goes to the lotus, the lotus opens its petals and takes it inside

00:34:23.853 --> 00:34:28.577
and makes it, sleep on the corona that it has, very soft

00:34:28.626 --> 00:34:31.010
one on the bed, and covers it nicely

00:34:31.188 --> 00:34:34.622
and gives it a nice, you see,

00:34:34.650 --> 00:34:38.510
swinging feeling, that it feels it is in the lap of the mother

00:34:38.602 --> 00:34:43.232
and it sleeps off. Even such a animal, it gives a place to live.

00:34:44.075 --> 00:34:48.013
Now the man who is a laxshmipati the one who is blessed with Laxshmi,

00:34:48.255 --> 00:34:50.972
has to have a temperament like that.

00:34:51.257 --> 00:34:53.106
Anybody who comes to his house,

00:34:53.263 --> 00:34:59.129
anyone, should be very readily accepted. I've seen people like that,

00:34:59.178 --> 00:35:02.046
I've seen in my lifetime, should be accepted and they should be

00:35:02.095 --> 00:35:06.375
very gratified to have such people in the house

00:35:06.446 --> 00:35:08.130
and should feel that oh God,

00:35:08.308 --> 00:35:11.051
what a blessing it is that we have a guest in the house.

00:35:11.165 --> 00:35:14.788
But in modern times, we find out devices and methods,

00:35:14.902 --> 00:35:16.902
how to avoid guests,

00:35:18.128 --> 00:35:20.644
guests are equal to pests.

00:35:22.944 --> 00:35:26.715
I was in London, we were living on Surrey Hills and

00:35:26.807 --> 00:35:28.687
we had bungalows, separate bungalows,

00:35:28.736 --> 00:35:31.409
quite good bungalows I should say, there were seven bungalows.

00:35:31.973 --> 00:35:34.436
And poor husbands were taken to tasks

00:35:34.477 --> 00:35:36.584
for mowing the lawns and everything and the wife used to

00:35:36.633 --> 00:35:38.267
tell them now come along do it properly

00:35:38.424 --> 00:35:39.737
and the polishing of the,

00:35:40.151 --> 00:35:42.917
brass whatever was there and everything was done very well.

00:35:43.245 --> 00:35:46.302
But I didn't see even a rat enter those houses,

00:35:46.528 --> 00:35:49.102
even a rat, I mean leave alone human beings.

00:35:49.602 --> 00:35:53.358
Nothing entered those houses, only these two persons used to come out

00:35:53.665 --> 00:35:54.362
and go in.

00:35:54.862 --> 00:35:57.794
And I don't know they might be having some yearly,

00:35:58.015 --> 00:36:00.015
some sort of a get-together, maybe.

00:36:00.322 --> 00:36:05.163
But nobody, while My house was naturally, I am like this,

00:36:05.234 --> 00:36:09.468
so it was open all the time, people would come in and go out and this and that

00:36:09.603 --> 00:36:11.603
and I was just enjoying their company.

00:36:11.674 --> 00:36:12.727
And one day they asked me,

00:36:12.905 --> 00:36:15.295
what's the matter in Your house, all the time people are

00:36:15.344 --> 00:36:18.605
coming and going and used to wonder what is it going on inside.

00:36:18.762 --> 00:36:22.481
I said nothing, just they come, have tea and go, that's all, just

00:36:22.616 --> 00:36:25.340
some talk together, some rapport of love.

00:36:25.454 --> 00:36:27.324
But what is this, all the doors are closed,

00:36:27.415 --> 00:36:30.370
that way I must say Sydney people are very open hearted,

00:36:30.611 --> 00:36:35.198
and they are, they like to be together, there is a togetherness in them.

00:36:35.461 --> 00:36:39.395
But with all this, if you cannot have togetherness,

00:36:39.486 --> 00:36:41.486
to enjoy your wealth with others,

00:36:41.878 --> 00:36:43.471
then what's the use of all the wealth.

00:36:43.626 --> 00:36:45.626
If you have wealth, you'll go for horse-racing,

00:36:45.803 --> 00:36:47.520
that's also your own enjoyment.

00:36:47.718 --> 00:36:51.132
If you have wealth you will do something else which is so individualistic.

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:53.221
You cannot enjoy your wealth

00:36:53.291 --> 00:36:55.291
unless and until you share it.

00:36:55.532 --> 00:36:57.532
As I told you the other day that

00:36:57.601 --> 00:37:02.200
I am, a capitalist in the sense I have all the powers within myself.

00:37:03.325 --> 00:37:06.247
But, I cannot live without sharing it,

00:37:06.316 --> 00:37:09.345
so I am the greatest communist, because I just cannot enjoy,

00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.740
that's why I had to come all the way to Australia

00:37:11.918 --> 00:37:15.127
and today my husband was so insistent that I should come back soon,

00:37:15.196 --> 00:37:18.735
I said: 'No, I have to meet all the Australians still, and then I'll come.'

00:37:18.955 --> 00:37:22.459
So unless and until you share this love after realization,

00:37:22.571 --> 00:37:25.049
you do not enjoy. All isms drop out,

00:37:25.269 --> 00:37:27.785
because you become combination of both extremes,

00:37:28.050 --> 00:37:31.167
and you just start enjoying yourself.

00:37:31.387 --> 00:37:33.387
Now this lotus is in the hand

00:37:33.564 --> 00:37:37.820
and another hand that the Goddess has is like this. She has four hands,

00:37:38.061 --> 00:37:39.114
and one hand like this.

00:37:40.217 --> 00:37:43.377
Now this hand that is like this means,

00:37:43.532 --> 00:37:48.353
you see with this we must give, we must give, we must be generous.

00:37:48.487 --> 00:37:52.296
Miserly people cannot be the blessed ones,

00:37:52.451 --> 00:37:56.998
they cannot be. Miserly rich is the horridest thing that you could think of.

00:37:57.369 --> 00:37:59.369
Mean, if you see a miserly person,

00:38:00.365 --> 00:38:03.502
I mean, I don't know, I get a headache with a man like that, you see, who

00:38:03.549 --> 00:38:05.763
goes on counting each and every pi

00:38:05.875 --> 00:38:08.994
and measuring everything, you see miserly horrible things

00:38:09.085 --> 00:38:11.712
and ultimately when they die, their children

00:38:11.736 --> 00:38:14.061
take out all their money and just spend it over.

00:38:16.501 --> 00:38:19.269
They have, miserly people have another way of

00:38:19.316 --> 00:38:21.316
getting their money looted. For example

00:38:21.450 --> 00:38:25.025
a thief might come in, if not thief then,

00:38:25.094 --> 00:38:27.094
their children will become very wayward

00:38:27.249 --> 00:38:28.603
or something will happen,

00:38:28.737 --> 00:38:32.231
they will get sick and they'll have hand brokens and

00:38:32.278 --> 00:38:35.022
feet broken or something, and they will have to spend money.

00:38:35.651 --> 00:38:40.039
So the miserly people are such a nuisance to the society.

00:38:40.237 --> 00:38:42.458
They give nothing to the society they are

00:38:42.527 --> 00:38:45.785
there for themselves and they are just malignant personalities.

00:38:46.285 --> 00:38:48.285
The people who give,

00:38:48.785 --> 00:38:51.159
not of course I don't believe into giving

00:38:51.250 --> 00:38:54.199
into somebody freely because that also can spoil people.

00:38:54.354 --> 00:38:57.856
If you give something to someone very freely,

00:38:57.903 --> 00:38:59.903
they can be completely spoilt and,

00:39:00.511 --> 00:39:03.202
they would not know how to use that money.

00:39:03.573 --> 00:39:05.573
This is the trouble with human beings is,

00:39:05.707 --> 00:39:07.707
that they cannot bear anything.

00:39:07.970 --> 00:39:08.956
If you give them money,

00:39:09.023 --> 00:39:11.630
either they'll become miserly or they become wayward.

00:39:11.979 --> 00:39:15.068
If you give them power either they become dictatorial

00:39:15.204 --> 00:39:17.439
or they become destroyers.

00:39:17.551 --> 00:39:20.907
I mean, you cannot give anything to human beings

00:39:21.019 --> 00:39:22.232
without realization.

00:39:22.495 --> 00:39:24.820
Anything they get extreme, they become mad.

00:39:24.954 --> 00:39:26.954
That's one word you can explain.

00:39:27.282 --> 00:39:30.344
Now Krishna has said, 'yoga kshema mahatmyam'.

00:39:30.478 --> 00:39:33.566
He has said I give you Yoga,

00:39:33.829 --> 00:39:36.093
that is union with God, self-realization,

00:39:36.119 --> 00:39:38.598
and then I look after your kshema,

00:39:38.753 --> 00:39:41.774
and kshema means your well-being.

00:39:42.123 --> 00:39:44.984
This well-being is brought forth with this Laxshmi,

00:39:45.075 --> 00:39:48.032
with one hand that is giving, the another is the protection.

00:39:48.360 --> 00:39:51.518
This hand which gives, should not, the other hand should not know.

00:39:52.018 --> 00:39:55.566
It should be so done so gracefully, graciously.

00:39:55.657 --> 00:39:58.261
Today only I was telling the story to some people,

00:39:58.955 --> 00:40:00.955
about my own father,

00:40:01.024 --> 00:40:04.362
who was a very generous man I've ever known.

00:40:04.668 --> 00:40:08.521
And he had a habit on a Sunday afternoon he used to go,

00:40:08.698 --> 00:40:11.532
he used to call all the people and say that I have to

00:40:11.558 --> 00:40:13.903
give away lots of things, I have too many things in the house.

00:40:13.929 --> 00:40:16.446
He'd take out all the blankets, sometimes all the

00:40:16.558 --> 00:40:20.736
utensils and sometimes food, anything that he felt like he used to give way.

00:40:20.870 --> 00:40:25.344
So people would come and he would pass on and his head was bent like that,

00:40:25.844 --> 00:40:27.844
and some people told him, what's the use, some people are

00:40:27.870 --> 00:40:30.131
taking three blankets, some are taking two blankets,

00:40:30.155 --> 00:40:33.291
you don't even see what's happening you are just giving away,

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.231
please at least raise your head.

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:37.123
So he said: 'The problem is like this,

00:40:37.257 --> 00:40:39.257
because I don't give, it's God Who is giving,

00:40:39.391 --> 00:40:40.733
I'm just standing in between.

00:40:40.867 --> 00:40:42.010
And they all are saying that

00:40:42.057 --> 00:40:44.187
you are giving you are giving, thank you, thank you.

00:40:44.278 --> 00:40:46.278
So I feel very shy, first of all.

00:40:46.369 --> 00:40:49.647
And secondly it is the lookout of God who is giving these things

00:40:49.782 --> 00:40:52.319
to see whether one gets two or one. Why should I bother.

00:40:52.388 --> 00:40:56.389
I'm just standing in between, I'm not supposed to see who takes two or one.'

00:40:56.889 --> 00:40:59.730
Such generosity I've seen, in my own lifetime.

00:40:59.864 --> 00:41:02.720
And I have seen, the more generous he was,

00:41:02.940 --> 00:41:05.631
the more generosity flew into our house.

00:41:05.743 --> 00:41:09.994
I mean, that like if you open this door from the other side it starts flowing.

00:41:10.041 --> 00:41:13.325
But some people have sixty shirts, but still they'll go

00:41:13.372 --> 00:41:15.070
to the market and buy shirts.

00:41:15.182 --> 00:41:17.182
And they'll say: 'Oh I have a weakness for shirts.'

00:41:17.466 --> 00:41:19.466
Now I don't understand this weakness

00:41:19.557 --> 00:41:21.792
of heaping up shirts after shirts.

00:41:23.391 --> 00:41:25.529
It is ridiculous, isn't it.

00:41:25.576 --> 00:41:28.203
Some of these things really are ridiculous,

00:41:28.272 --> 00:41:29.688
that I have a weakness for shoes,

00:41:29.779 --> 00:41:32.299
now you go and see the shoes are from top to bottom,

00:41:32.367 --> 00:41:35.782
you can open a shoe shop, or,

00:41:35.894 --> 00:41:39.768
it's like that, what's the use of getting so many shoes

00:41:39.815 --> 00:41:43.358
because your foot has got the same size for years now,

00:41:43.405 --> 00:41:45.995
it's not going to change, even after realization.

00:41:46.366 --> 00:41:50.766
So there is no need to, I mean if your shoes give way is all right

00:41:50.857 --> 00:41:54.587
but, I too have the same problem. That

00:41:54.699 --> 00:41:58.958
I, My disciples know that they should give me a shoe, I don't know why,

00:41:59.070 --> 00:42:01.310
they give me a shoe, all the time I go there they give me

00:42:01.336 --> 00:42:03.423
chappal or a shoe or something. I said now

00:42:03.449 --> 00:42:04.781
I've too many now what to do?

00:42:04.850 --> 00:42:07.583
They said: 'Mother return it to us we'll keep it for vibrations.'

00:42:07.717 --> 00:42:10.152
I said: 'That's a good idea,' because I have no place

00:42:10.265 --> 00:42:12.889
to keep all these shoes, I mean I am not a cobbler,

00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.545
I cannot do anything with it.

00:42:14.571 --> 00:42:16.183
So it is useless.

00:42:16.209 --> 00:42:17.843
Best thing is to give flowers

00:42:17.934 --> 00:42:22.216
so that I can again send them back to some ocean or to some river.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.844
So even in there, when we go on accumulating,

00:42:25.972 --> 00:42:28.516
and I must have this, you go to the shop the people are

00:42:28.585 --> 00:42:31.976
like this like this, watching everything. What is there to watch.

00:42:32.196 --> 00:42:36.015
You see whatever you want to buy you go in the shop see what you like, you have it.

00:42:36.106 --> 00:42:38.106
But sort of I must have this, I must have that.

00:42:38.367 --> 00:42:42.320
I have known a person who had ten ironing boards

00:42:42.378 --> 00:42:45.752
and twenty iron in his house. All locked up.

00:42:45.792 --> 00:42:46.980
I said: 'For whom?'

00:42:47.093 --> 00:42:50.277
So she said: 'Maybe my children.' I said: 'You have only one child,

00:42:50.372 --> 00:42:52.044
God has been very miserly about you,

00:42:52.213 --> 00:42:55.657
you have only one child. And now what are you going to do with this?

00:42:55.697 --> 00:42:58.429
You'd better throw them away.' And with the electrical

00:42:58.507 --> 00:43:01.076
I mean appliances you know they go off and all that.

00:43:01.152 --> 00:43:02.017
But she would not.

00:43:02.204 --> 00:43:04.672
She could not, she used show everyone: 'See now I've got it.'

00:43:04.859 --> 00:43:07.539
Not antiques, all modern stuff, you see.

00:43:07.781 --> 00:43:10.465
And this is how the things go on accumulating

00:43:10.522 --> 00:43:13.287
which has no value aesthetically or in any way.

00:43:13.787 --> 00:43:17.188
Actually you should buy something only to give it to someone.

00:43:17.541 --> 00:43:21.682
That's the best way of enjoying it to the maximum, you see.

00:43:21.795 --> 00:43:23.795
And anybody likes it - have it.

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:25.835
You see, that's the best way.

00:43:25.893 --> 00:43:29.480
It's a great thing, I mean I tell you it's rather difficult for you people

00:43:29.630 --> 00:43:32.478
to understand but I am one of them Wwho does that

00:43:32.591 --> 00:43:37.083
very often, and my children and my husband are rather worried you know,

00:43:37.141 --> 00:43:40.022
God knows next time what She'll give away.

00:43:40.853 --> 00:43:42.853
But you'll be amazed I've so many things,

00:43:42.893 --> 00:43:44.670
so many things, despite all this,

00:43:44.875 --> 00:43:47.729
I mean the whole time thinking what to give to whom,

00:43:47.787 --> 00:43:51.194
still it's so many things in the house, now that we have to take a bigger house.

00:43:51.952 --> 00:43:54.508
I don't know what to do with so many things

00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:58.698
and I try to thrust things on the people, Baba you take this you have liked it.

00:43:58.738 --> 00:44:00.738
But they say: 'No no no how can you give me.'

00:44:00.888 --> 00:44:03.708
But really that gives me such a pleasure,

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:06.208
and one must learn how to do.

00:44:06.708 --> 00:44:08.396
But I've have seen human beings are different.

00:44:08.472 --> 00:44:10.472
For themselves they'll buy diamonds,

00:44:10.512 --> 00:44:13.907
and for others they'll buy artificial things.

00:44:14.315 --> 00:44:15.781
It's very common you know.

00:44:15.839 --> 00:44:17.839
They will buy for, they are wearing diamonds

00:44:17.952 --> 00:44:20.529
and when it is coming to giving to others they'll give artificial.

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:23.029
At least don't wear at that time the diamond,

00:44:23.234 --> 00:44:25.234
at least that much decency should be there.

00:44:25.495 --> 00:44:29.235
So you see when it comes to giving, give it with your full heart.

00:44:29.735 --> 00:44:31.735
You just feel that love of giving

00:44:32.161 --> 00:44:36.522
and you feel so happy, because you feel so big about yourself,

00:44:36.746 --> 00:44:40.111
like an ocean that's giving so much of clouds

00:44:40.168 --> 00:44:44.166
and again it is receiving these rivers into it, and again making it into clouds,

00:44:44.335 --> 00:44:49.198
a sort of a circle of beautiful conversion into beauty

00:44:49.238 --> 00:44:51.684
after beauty starts, it's so beautiful.

00:44:52.184 --> 00:44:55.120
And that's what we should try to become,

00:44:55.252 --> 00:44:58.576
a part of that circle, which is so beautiful

00:44:58.634 --> 00:45:01.397
and which is so joy giving, to yourself also.

00:45:02.376 --> 00:45:07.462
And this is what it is, and this hand is for ashraya, means for the protection.

00:45:08.330 --> 00:45:12.971
You must protect the people who are your subordinates,

00:45:13.066 --> 00:45:15.832
who are dependent on you, your children.

00:45:16.093 --> 00:45:20.066
Like, it's a very common thing to insult your children from their childhood.

00:45:20.566 --> 00:45:22.566
Why did you spoil that carpet?

00:45:23.066 --> 00:45:25.866
Why did you do that? You should not have said this,

00:45:26.127 --> 00:45:29.388
why did you? This is a very wrong thing of discipline.

00:45:29.796 --> 00:45:33.099
Best discipline is to put dignity into children.

00:45:33.875 --> 00:45:37.485
You see, a good home in India we'll say,

00:45:37.709 --> 00:45:41.338
is known by the way children are addressed in the family.

00:45:41.507 --> 00:45:47.241
Like, in a good family we address the children like sa.

00:45:47.411 --> 00:45:53.543
Little bit like that, ap, means sa. We never address the children with indignity,

00:45:53.642 --> 00:45:56.265
and we put them on a dignified level.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:46:02.076
And it's a very nice thing. I'll tell you about my own granddaughter,

00:46:02.576 --> 00:46:09.638
that, somebody was telling her one day that, there's a very, this boy

00:46:09.737 --> 00:46:13.395
and why don't you marry him. She said: 'Why do you want to talk about marriage?

00:46:13.567 --> 00:46:16.994
I'm not yet grown at all to think about marriage,

00:46:17.166 --> 00:46:19.888
and we have to be dignified about things,

00:46:20.023 --> 00:46:23.069
how can we think of marriage when we are not to think,

00:46:23.277 --> 00:46:27.858
and my grandmother will marry me and I want to live, a dignified person.'

00:46:27.884 --> 00:46:32.060
A little girl of seven years said this to this woman who was very,

00:46:32.232 --> 00:46:35.212
sort of pseudo-intellectual type and she tried

00:46:35.274 --> 00:46:39.070
to tease my granddaughter. She said: 'It's not dignified'.

00:46:39.570 --> 00:46:43.689
Just think of that. At the age of seven years they have their sense of dignity.

00:46:43.861 --> 00:46:47.633
If you tell them, you see they, you need not tell them don't spoil the carpet,

00:46:47.805 --> 00:46:51.257
but give them dignity they will never spoil it. You'll be surprised.

00:46:51.392 --> 00:46:54.941
Because we all the time cut them short, they become so bad.

00:46:55.076 --> 00:46:58.023
They want to, they think we are good for nothing, we don't know

00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:00.923
what to do, all the time they're telling us like this.

00:47:01.022 --> 00:47:03.943
Or even if you have to tell them, tell about somebody else,

00:47:04.115 --> 00:47:06.779
like that boy, you know, he was absolutely

00:47:06.951 --> 00:47:08.637
useless, he didn't know what to do,

00:47:08.721 --> 00:47:11.197
he spoiled the whole carpet, I went to his house and slipped down.

00:47:11.252 --> 00:47:13.103
The child immediately gets the thing.

00:47:13.129 --> 00:47:15.795
But directly all the time hitting the child,

00:47:15.939 --> 00:47:17.939
you see gives him a personality

00:47:18.053 --> 00:47:20.144
which does not hold,

00:47:20.644 --> 00:47:22.644
anything substantial within.

00:47:22.728 --> 00:47:26.536
He might later on became a very arrogant person taking a cue from his parents,

00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:28.446
and he may behave the same manner,

00:47:28.530 --> 00:47:30.323
but he would not be that dignity

00:47:30.437 --> 00:47:34.339
which just is silent and is expressing and manifesting.

00:47:34.483 --> 00:47:37.421
It should be a silent dignity which just manifests,

00:47:37.505 --> 00:47:39.505
and when people see such a person,

00:47:39.619 --> 00:47:44.389
it happens, people see and say 'Oh what a man, what a dignity'.

00:47:44.889 --> 00:47:48.687
You see that's what, and they become sort of ideals for society.

00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:52.800
I think this, correcting the children is not the way,

00:47:52.914 --> 00:47:56.147
it is not disciplining, but it is making them grow.

00:47:56.439 --> 00:47:59.276
What we have to give to our children is the joy,

00:47:59.568 --> 00:48:04.548
is happiness of the family, is the complete security,

00:48:04.632 --> 00:48:06.872
a sense of complete security

00:48:07.135 --> 00:48:09.440
and you will see you'll never have teenage problems,

00:48:10.059 --> 00:48:11.761
never have teenage problem.

00:48:11.845 --> 00:48:13.845
You'll be surprised you put them anywhere,

00:48:14.968 --> 00:48:19.504
they'll be so dignified and so mature, that people will be amazed.

00:48:20.004 --> 00:48:23.002
You won't have to tell them. Even small little children I've seen,

00:48:23.502 --> 00:48:25.415
if you keep your house very clean,

00:48:25.915 --> 00:48:30.049
and also always look after it, children themselves will keep it clean.

00:48:30.204 --> 00:48:32.812
They would like to do. Because children are

00:48:32.881 --> 00:48:37.215
really the budding beauties.

00:48:37.715 --> 00:48:40.799
When we cut them we cut them at the root.

00:48:41.040 --> 00:48:43.040
They expect so much from us you see,

00:48:43.138 --> 00:48:44.728
they lose all their dignity

00:48:44.912 --> 00:48:46.912
and I'll tell you try this with your children,

00:48:47.010 --> 00:48:50.449
give them dignity, you will be amazed how they behave.

00:48:50.633 --> 00:48:52.488
We say they are spoilt, I've never see

00:48:52.614 --> 00:48:54.879
children being spoilt when they are dignified.

00:48:55.063 --> 00:48:58.857
Like my own grandson is a realized soul who's a very great person and

00:48:58.926 --> 00:49:01.642
all his friends are above twenty-five years,

00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:04.801
you see he's just a five six year old boy and

00:49:04.985 --> 00:49:07.799
he doesn't like to wear any dress which has got

00:49:07.954 --> 00:49:10.703
funny faces and all that He says:

00:49:10.858 --> 00:49:12.858
'This is like a clown, I'm not a clown,

00:49:13.013 --> 00:49:16.481
I don't want to wear'. I found it very difficult in Singapore to buy

00:49:16.579 --> 00:49:17.798
a pant for him

00:49:17.953 --> 00:49:19.499
which didn't have any funny faces,

00:49:19.540 --> 00:49:22.299
because all of them had Mickey Mouse this that.

00:49:22.397 --> 00:49:24.939
And I've seen my grandchildren also,

00:49:25.094 --> 00:49:29.104
daughters, there these dolls with, you see this ducky

00:49:29.173 --> 00:49:32.247
what you call the duck sort of a face you see.

00:49:32.402 --> 00:49:34.812
They said: 'What's wrong with these dolls,

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:37.986
they should know how to put their lips. This is not good.'

00:49:38.084 --> 00:49:41.310
I mean you see, they themselves know, that this is wrong.

00:49:41.465 --> 00:49:45.053
'She's going to go into tantrums.' That's what they say.

00:49:45.553 --> 00:49:48.171
This duck is going to go into tantrums

00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:50.125
that's why she is behaving like this,

00:49:50.165 --> 00:49:54.408
oh like that, you see they are great-grandmothers sometimes the way they

00:49:54.965 --> 00:49:57.237
do some things and the way they behave.

00:49:57.392 --> 00:49:59.392
But we must give them

00:49:59.547 --> 00:50:02.207
real love and joy and happiness,

00:50:02.535 --> 00:50:04.535
that's the thing we can give to our children

00:50:04.891 --> 00:50:08.925
and you'll be amazed that this Australia is going to be blessed with children

00:50:09.080 --> 00:50:12.256
who are very great saints,

00:50:12.354 --> 00:50:14.528
very very great saints. I know that,

00:50:14.654 --> 00:50:18.890
and you have to look after them with dignity.

00:50:19.764 --> 00:50:22.857
Very great saints are going to be born in this country,

00:50:22.897 --> 00:50:26.574
so I have to request to you, that forget your problems,

00:50:26.643 --> 00:50:30.939
husband wife problem, is nothing. Look after your children,

00:50:31.065 --> 00:50:34.543
give them dignity, give them a nest where they could live,

00:50:34.583 --> 00:50:37.312
forget because I've seen in England I've seen

00:50:37.410 --> 00:50:40.190
even an eighty-year old woman behaves like a bride

00:50:40.288 --> 00:50:43.572
I mean she doesn't get over her feeling that she was a bride.

00:50:43.641 --> 00:50:45.786
Like one of the 'Great Expectations'

00:50:45.999 --> 00:50:48.743
you must have read of Charles Dickens where there was a bride

00:50:48.897 --> 00:50:51.044
who was sitting all the time thinking she was a bride.

00:50:51.083 --> 00:50:52.820
I see that picture even today,

00:50:52.916 --> 00:50:54.916
all the time they are in bridal mood.

00:50:55.128 --> 00:50:59.359
You see you are a mother and you have to treat your children with that dignity

00:50:59.484 --> 00:51:02.159
and with that love that a mother should give.

00:51:02.284 --> 00:51:05.053
It is very difficult for some people

00:51:05.121 --> 00:51:06.974
to accept the position of a mother,

00:51:07.099 --> 00:51:09.099
they think why women should be the mothers.

00:51:09.195 --> 00:51:14.630
I said this is the greatest things look at me. Look at me.

00:51:15.822 --> 00:51:17.915
This is the greatest thing to be the mother,

00:51:18.040 --> 00:51:21.007
to love everyone, that they depend on you for

00:51:21.161 --> 00:51:24.262
love and guidance, just for love.

00:51:24.445 --> 00:51:27.197
Such a great thing to feel: 'Oh God

00:51:27.409 --> 00:51:31.550
see how much I can give, how many cups I can fill,'

00:51:31.848 --> 00:51:33.848
it's such a great feeling,

00:51:33.973 --> 00:51:37.807
I wish you would know what a mother is and the,

00:51:38.307 --> 00:51:42.112
motherhood you have to learn from your children and grandchildren and expand it

00:51:42.208 --> 00:51:45.958
to the whole universe. It's such a great thing a woman has in the same way

00:51:46.054 --> 00:51:49.872
the father has to do a lot of things about which I will tell you

00:51:49.939 --> 00:51:51.613
when we go to the other center.

00:51:51.709 --> 00:51:54.677
I think I've talked at length on this center because

00:51:54.687 --> 00:51:57.999
all the time what I find these two centers are catching

00:51:58.124 --> 00:52:00.124
very much in Australia.

00:52:00.624 --> 00:52:04.621
So we have to talk about the things that are catching on this and this.

00:52:04.775 --> 00:52:08.453
And today I saw there five six children with their both the fingers in,

00:52:08.578 --> 00:52:11.358
all realized children with those fingers they were sucking,

00:52:11.454 --> 00:52:13.454
and they were showing me again sucking like that.

00:52:13.637 --> 00:52:15.637
So you can imagine how much it is,

00:52:16.137 --> 00:52:19.140
and otherwise this one and this means that

00:52:19.236 --> 00:52:22.345
you have been going to some unauthorized personality.

00:52:23.076 --> 00:52:26.636
If you are going to some unauthorized personality this thumb will be caught up,

00:52:26.732 --> 00:52:30.660
that's why children put their things in their mouths and

00:52:31.160 --> 00:52:33.160
Freud has his own nonsensical theory,

00:52:33.372 --> 00:52:37.130
but actually it is the center that is catching

00:52:37.312 --> 00:52:39.895
with these born-realized children are showing you.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:45.426
Now for today, I may not be able to cover other

00:52:45.790 --> 00:52:48.572
centers so much, but later on,

00:52:48.682 --> 00:52:50.580
what is the date we are having the program now?

00:52:53.019 --> 00:52:55.033
Next Monday Wednesday Friday,

00:52:55.079 --> 00:52:58.897
three days are there out of which I will cover all these centers

00:52:58.941 --> 00:53:01.608
and specially that of Christ I would like to speak,

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:05.331
because I met some people, when I went to America

00:53:05.538 --> 00:53:07.216
I was telling the people there

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:08.943
that you are to be born again,

00:53:09.005 --> 00:53:12.129
you are to be born again and you must have your realization,

00:53:12.216 --> 00:53:15.307
so what I found whatever lecture I gave there were big big,

00:53:15.612 --> 00:53:19.444
much bigger than these you see, they had brought to tape

00:53:19.482 --> 00:53:23.533
all my speeches, and the people who organized my program told me that:

00:53:23.571 --> 00:53:27.760
'Mother you'd better get it patented or don't allow them to tape it.'

00:53:27.798 --> 00:53:30.955
I said: 'Why?' They said: 'They will be publishing these are all writers

00:53:30.993 --> 00:53:32.823
and this I said: 'Very good let them write.'

00:53:32.885 --> 00:53:37.642
But some of them started an organization called 'born again', imagine.

00:53:37.704 --> 00:53:40.666
Now if I said you have to be,

00:53:40.728 --> 00:53:44.105
then you start an organization that we are already self-certificated.

00:53:45.335 --> 00:53:48.229
You see it's a thing one should understand you are to be born again.

00:53:48.291 --> 00:53:53.024
Now Christ has said that you will be born through Me. Is a fact.

00:53:53.524 --> 00:53:57.780
Where is Christ, is here. This is the gate, see the narrow gate

00:53:58.113 --> 00:54:01.011
and your kundalini has to pass through that.

00:54:01.681 --> 00:54:05.133
Now in case it does not pass you have to say Lord's Prayer.

00:54:05.365 --> 00:54:07.365
You have to take the name of Christ

00:54:07.549 --> 00:54:09.380
and you have to adore Him,

00:54:09.562 --> 00:54:13.802
then only it passes through, shows that you have passed through Christ.

00:54:14.302 --> 00:54:17.464
You enter into the kingdom of God which is the,

00:54:17.964 --> 00:54:20.620
limbic area. So, it's a fact

00:54:20.875 --> 00:54:23.120
when He said you have to pass through Me

00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:26.296
He didn't mean that people who are self-certificated

00:54:26.383 --> 00:54:28.383
can say that: 'All right this is Christ,

00:54:28.421 --> 00:54:31.949
this is Bible this is Christ,' as if Christ is somewhere lying there,

00:54:32.084 --> 00:54:34.084
you just have to turn a stone and you get Him there.

00:54:34.997 --> 00:54:38.567
Christ is here. How do you approach Him is only

00:54:38.629 --> 00:54:42.094
through the kundalini awakening and it passes through Christ.

00:54:42.351 --> 00:54:43.391
This is the door.

00:54:43.478 --> 00:54:47.490
Now say, you are all Christians or maybe you are Jews or whatever it is,

00:54:47.722 --> 00:54:50.196
but, in India for example

00:54:50.307 --> 00:54:53.426
they have a very antagonistic feelings towards Christianity.

00:54:53.804 --> 00:54:55.926
Now even a Hindu, or a Muslim,

00:54:56.864 --> 00:55:01.360
if he denies he says all right I don't believe in Christ. He has to.

00:55:01.568 --> 00:55:03.568
I have to tell him that: 'See,

00:55:03.655 --> 00:55:06.808
if you don't believe in Christ I cannot give you realization.

00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:09.040
You have to ask for forgiveness,

00:55:09.078 --> 00:55:12.277
and you have to request Christ, then only this will pass through.

00:55:12.412 --> 00:55:15.214
Now there may be Jews or Christians,

00:55:15.349 --> 00:55:18.317
any type, they have to know that all of them are here.

00:55:18.817 --> 00:55:21.940
For example there was a doctor who came from,

00:55:22.075 --> 00:55:25.360
Tehran to see me, he had cancer,

00:55:25.860 --> 00:55:28.930
and he came to see me, he had this cancer of the stomach,

00:55:29.041 --> 00:55:33.573
so I told him that: 'Do you believe that Mohammed Sahib was the same

00:55:33.635 --> 00:55:37.571
as Dattatreya or Nanaka?' He said: 'No I don't even believe,

00:55:37.682 --> 00:55:39.682
when you say that He was Moses or Abraham.

00:55:40.014 --> 00:55:42.182
I said: 'He was Moses Abraham

00:55:42.512 --> 00:55:44.512
and they are very powerful personality.

00:55:44.647 --> 00:55:46.647
Unless and until you accept,

00:55:46.834 --> 00:55:49.147
that He was Moses and Abraham,

00:55:49.647 --> 00:55:51.647
you are not going to get it.

00:55:51.758 --> 00:55:55.520
He said: 'Ah, I cannot say that,' because Jews and Muslims are like this.

00:55:56.093 --> 00:55:59.363
I said they both are the same they are very great personalities,

00:55:59.450 --> 00:56:01.450
you are just fighting for nothing at all.

00:56:01.512 --> 00:56:06.569
I know Who is Moses and I know Who is, Abraham.

00:56:07.069 --> 00:56:10.770
But he would not accept, for eight days, then his wife, you know

00:56:10.832 --> 00:56:13.845
she was wiser, she said you'd better get it, you are not well,

00:56:13.859 --> 00:56:16.403
you'll die, better get it, then they came.

00:56:16.465 --> 00:56:19.152
You see this is what happens, they are just compelled.

00:56:19.214 --> 00:56:22.319
He came: 'All right Mother what ever you say I will accept.' I said: 'Not that,

00:56:22.357 --> 00:56:25.532
from your heart you have to say,' and he was cured,

00:56:25.594 --> 00:56:27.594
for your information he was cured.

00:56:27.705 --> 00:56:29.705
So do not have any extreme ideas,

00:56:29.792 --> 00:56:32.603
They are all in there, and They are all One.

00:56:32.690 --> 00:56:36.868
Only we are fighting saying this is mine, that is mine,

00:56:36.906 --> 00:56:40.174
so this is I have just hinted that this center because I think

00:56:40.212 --> 00:56:42.113
that's a very important center

00:56:42.175 --> 00:56:45.655
as I have discussed with the void, about all these Abraham,

00:56:45.693 --> 00:56:48.989
Moses and all the Old Testament, which is so important.

00:56:49.027 --> 00:56:52.711
How, and how Christ is the One, Who,

00:56:52.798 --> 00:56:56.591
stays there, Who crucified Himself, to make a path

00:56:56.653 --> 00:57:00.145
for us to pass through, why His crucifixion was necessary.

00:57:00.183 --> 00:57:04.245
So I'll spend more time on that later on. I hope

00:57:04.332 --> 00:57:08.757
you'll make it convenient to come again, and I hope you'll get a better hall,

00:57:08.868 --> 00:57:12.488
they are feeling very warm here. Thank you very much.

00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:26.660
Now, again we can have some questions
if you want, for two minutes only.

00:57:26.660 --> 00:57:31.300
Not much because it goes on.
Now some questions if you have.

00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.420
Because you see the questions now you ask
I’ll tell you one thing.

00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:38.260
There are certain limitations because
I have not talked about every chakra

00:57:38.260 --> 00:57:41.300
and the whole thing, all right?
So I’ve talked very little

00:57:41.300 --> 00:57:47.300
about the whole subject.
So you have to listen to the whole thing

00:57:47.300 --> 00:57:50.100
and then ask Me questions,
is much better.

00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:52.900
But if you have any substantial thing
you can ask Me

00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:54.820
and then I would like to
give you realization.

00:57:54.820 --> 00:57:57.770
That’s very important.

00:57:57.770 --> 00:58:01.940
Q: Mother I just want to know why,
if alcohol is so bad for you,

00:58:01.940 --> 00:58:04.167
did Christ turn the water into wine?

00:58:04.167 --> 00:58:06.340
Shri Mataji: Oh you see
that’s another big mistake.

00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:10.020
That time wine was not
this kind of a wine.

00:58:10.020 --> 00:58:13.780
You see people used to take wine
which is grape juice.

00:58:13.780 --> 00:58:19.540
Even today if you go to Jerusalem,
you get wine which is not fermented.

00:58:19.540 --> 00:58:24.020
It is prohibited, in the Bible
if you read Moses or Abraham,

00:58:24.020 --> 00:58:29.700
to take these strong drinks,
it is described very clearly

00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:32.500
but why Christ did not talk
about alcohol,

00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:35.380
there’s a difference between
wine and alcohol,

00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:38.100
wine which is fermented
and wine which is a real wine.

00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:41.060
You see otherwise He would have said
fermented wine.

00:58:41.060 --> 00:58:46.260
And, that’s a very common drink
and I also enjoy it very much,

00:58:46.260 --> 00:58:51.460
grapes I love.
So ordinary grape juice was the wine but,

00:58:51.460 --> 00:58:56.580
about this alcohol He didn’t talk much
because you see now I am with you,

00:58:56.580 --> 00:59:00.260
I have to give you realization
so I’m talking about Kundalini

00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:05.220
and realization isn’t it.
Now Christ did not have to deal

00:59:05.220 --> 00:59:08.500
with Kundalini at that time
but He had to talk of eternal life

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:11.380
so He talked about that,
and He showed with His Life

00:59:11.380 --> 00:59:13.940
that life is eternal
by His Resurrection.

00:59:13.940 --> 00:59:17.860
Now Abraham and Moses are,
all these Primordial Masters

00:59:17.860 --> 00:59:21.300
are concerned with your attention
and with your sustenance,

00:59:21.300 --> 00:59:25.780
so all of them, whether it was Mohammed
or anyone, have talked against alcohol,

00:59:25.780 --> 00:59:29.380
you see.
Whatever was their job was to look after

00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:33.060
the sustenance of the stomach
and we can see clearly,

00:59:33.060 --> 00:59:37.620
that how can anybody who is
of Christ’s quality,

00:59:37.620 --> 00:59:41.380
give you wine to drink,
which goes against your awareness.

00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.620
Is impossible.
But that’s how it is.

00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:48.660
We do not, you see we mould everything
according to our ideas

00:59:48.660 --> 00:59:53.060
but wine means ordinary wine.
You go today even, if you ask for wine,

00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.660
even in Switzerland,
you’ll be surprised

00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.980
that ordinary grape juice
is called as wine.

00:59:56.980 --> 01:00:00.420
Even the grape, that creeper
is called as wine.

01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.460
The whole thing is called as wine here.
Now there is no fermentation

01:00:03.460 --> 01:00:11.700
as far as wine is concerned,
but this is what it was. All right?

01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:30.180
Q: [unclear] in the Adi Guru Principle,
before Moses, before Abraham,

01:00:30.180 --> 01:00:32.007
what was there before?

01:00:32.007 --> 01:00:36.820
Shri Mataji: Very good question.
Now you see, yes, yes, I would say..

01:00:36.820 --> 01:00:38.500
Q: cont…and are there more to come,
he said.

01:00:38.500 --> 01:00:42.260
Shri Mataji: No that you forget,
but about the past I will tell you

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:45.220
something because, you see future
you just open it because I want to put

01:00:45.220 --> 01:00:47.700
your attention to present.
But still if you have asked the question

01:00:47.700 --> 01:00:51.860
is very good.
That, you see, there are five dimensions

01:00:51.860 --> 01:00:54.980
in which this area remains
within us also.

01:00:54.980 --> 01:01:01.220
So the first is the Vaikuntha area,
is the stage where God just incarnated,

01:01:01.220 --> 01:01:07.460
that aspect of God just incarnated as,
we can say the Vishnu

01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:12.820
or that represents the sustenance.
That Deity was.

01:01:12.820 --> 01:01:16.500
And that is at a, for example
we know Christ’s Birth on this Earth

01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:19.620
but how He was created in the Heavens
we do not know.

01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.220
So at this level also
there are five dimensions

01:01:23.220 --> 01:01:26.980
into which these things happen
and then ultimately He came to Earth.

01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:30.180
All right?
In the same way these things are projected,

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:33.860
in the subtler level,
at the Vaikuntha stage and all that.

01:01:33.860 --> 01:01:38.660
So all this is there, and I think
in one of My lectures on Creation

01:01:38.660 --> 01:01:42.180
I have described all these things.
I hope you’ll get those lectures

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:45.060
from England, and you’ll be able
to listen to them,

01:01:45.060 --> 01:01:48.820
in which all these things
I have described, quite a lot.

01:01:50.660 --> 01:01:53.060
Person: You are… behind them, Mother.

01:01:53.060 --> 01:02:01.380
Thank you.
You are such a nice, loving son of Mine.

01:02:01.380 --> 01:02:11.777
What question is there?

01:02:11.777 --> 01:02:22.727
Q: Do you have to give up your religion
if you become a Sahaja Yogi?

01:02:22.727 --> 01:02:25.860
Shri Mataji: Now, this is a question
which is your own.

01:02:25.860 --> 01:02:28.980
Wherever you are born
becomes your own religion.

01:02:28.980 --> 01:02:32.180
It’s a misidentification.
Supposing you are born a Hindu

01:02:32.180 --> 01:02:34.500
you become a Hindu.
If you are born a Christian

01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.700
you become a Christian.
If you are born a Muslim

01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:40.180
you become a Muslim.
Now what is your religion?

01:02:40.180 --> 01:02:43.060
Say you are a Christian,
Christ is very much there

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:47.540
but in all His dimensions
and you see all His relations with others.

01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:51.540
You cannot have just Christ isolated as:
‘My own.’ Is wrong.

01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:54.500
This is a myth.
You get over this.

01:02:54.500 --> 01:02:57.300
Supposing you have a stomach trouble,
you’ll have to go to Moses,

01:02:57.300 --> 01:03:00.180
you have to become a Jew,
or you have to become a Muslim.

01:03:00.180 --> 01:03:03.380
Now supposing you have a problem,
you have a headache, you think too much,

01:03:03.380 --> 01:03:07.780
you have to become a Christian.
Now, if you have a problem

01:03:07.780 --> 01:03:10.580
with your neck,
which most of you have here,

01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:13.300
especially here,
is to feeling guilty business,

01:03:13.300 --> 01:03:15.620
there’s a Deity for that
is called as Vishnumaya,

01:03:15.620 --> 01:03:17.540
you have to ask Her to help you.

01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:21.380
Then if you haven’t got
the witness power properly exhibited

01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.940
then you have become Shri Krishna,
you have to go to Him.

01:03:23.940 --> 01:03:27.460
And if your father has died
or something is possessed you,

01:03:27.460 --> 01:03:29.940
you have to go to Rama.
It’s like that.

01:03:29.940 --> 01:03:32.100
So how can you,
they are all within you,

01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.540
so how can you become only one.
You have so many things within you,

01:03:35.540 --> 01:03:39.540
in the same way the Primordial Being
is not just Rock of Gibraltar.

01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:43.220
These are different aspects of God
which are expressed in One Personality.

01:03:43.220 --> 01:03:45.860
There’s only One God
but Who manifests,

01:03:45.860 --> 01:03:48.580
through many aspects
this must be understood.

01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:53.220
About this also if I have time
I will tell you how the God

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:57.620
and His Power separated,
and how His Power created those

01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:00.740
manifestations of His aspect.
Like we are a human being

01:04:00.740 --> 01:04:04.420
but we have a nose, we have eyes,
we have a head, we have everything.

01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.380
Are we just like a rock?
Even a rock is not the rock

01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:10.660
because it has divisions.
Even this staircase if you see

01:04:10.660 --> 01:04:12.820
it has it’s fibers and things,
you can see.

01:04:12.820 --> 01:04:16.820
So nothing is like a solid stuff.
You see our idea about God

01:04:16.820 --> 01:04:20.740
is a solid stuff – He’s Christ,
and He is our own. No.

01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:26.260
He is the aspect that is the Son.
He is the Son of God.

01:04:26.260 --> 01:04:30.260
And there is God.
And there is the Holy Ghost.

01:04:30.260 --> 01:04:34.740
Already as Christians also you know,
as Jews also you know,

01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.900
that Jehovah is there, Moses is there,
Abraham is there.

01:04:38.900 --> 01:04:43.380
But the problem with all these is this,
that all those people

01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:49.140
who were born in these Arabic countries
had no chance to express themselves

01:04:49.140 --> 01:04:52.100
so clearly.
Nobody was there willing to listen.

01:04:52.100 --> 01:04:55.060
Now see Mohammed Sahib,
or say Abraham and Moses,

01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:58.980
they were all the time running away,
running away, they are on the run,

01:04:58.980 --> 01:05:02.500
all the time on the run.
There was no time like a Maccabean Hall

01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:06.820
where one could talk.
Imagine what a life poor Moses had to face,

01:05:06.820 --> 01:05:09.140
Abraham had to face,
just think of that.

01:05:09.140 --> 01:05:11.620
How could they tell
all these things about.

01:05:11.620 --> 01:05:14.580
So the knowledge that what,
just see now the run.

01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.060
You are just telling people:
‘Now don’t do this and don’t do that,’

01:05:17.060 --> 01:05:18.580
that’s all.

01:05:18.580 --> 01:05:23.780
But today the time is such
that you can see the whole,

01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.820
the whole picture,
because the whole picture is there,

01:05:26.820 --> 01:05:29.780
you can see.
So you should not have a narrow vision,

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:33.140
but see them in a bigger vision.
You make them narrower

01:05:33.140 --> 01:05:34.740
by your own narrow vision.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:38.500
There’s nothing like your religion.
There’s only one religion,

01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:44.100
and that is God’s religion
which is within you, which you transcend.

01:05:44.100 --> 01:05:46.660
When this religion gets enlightened
you transcend.

01:05:46.660 --> 01:05:50.500
For example I have no temptations at all.
I don’t know what is a temptation.

01:05:50.500 --> 01:05:53.860
I don’t know what is vanity.
I try, you know sometimes to put up a show:

01:05:53.860 --> 01:05:55.860
‘Now let Me be vain now
how do I become.

01:05:55.860 --> 01:05:56.980
What muscles should I teach.

01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:03.380
But I cannot do it.
I haven’t got that kind of a machinery

01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:06.500
inside, you see,
you just become beyond this.

01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:10.900
Then you don’t need religion
because you become religion.

01:06:10.900 --> 01:06:14.100
Don’t have to tell you anything.
It just happens.

01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:16.180
It just happens, you become that.

01:06:16.180 --> 01:06:20.660
And “my religion”, whatever we think of,
if you really believe in it

01:06:20.660 --> 01:06:24.260
then try to bring as many as possible
who belong to that.

01:06:25.060 --> 01:06:32.100
There are so many mistakes
people are doing in the name of religion.

01:06:32.100 --> 01:06:34.820
So many mistakes.
One small mistake I have told you,

01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:40.740
put all the dead bodies
in the churchyard. The Christians do.

01:06:40.740 --> 01:06:44.580
So many mistakes the Jews do,
you know that.

01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:49.220
We are making mistakes after mistakes,
and we should see what have we achieved?

01:06:49.220 --> 01:06:53.060
Our forefathers were going to church,
they were going to synagogue

01:06:53.060 --> 01:06:55.140
and they were going to synagogue,
and they were going to –

01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:59.700
what have they achieved? Nothing.
So let us see the complete universal thing

01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:03.220
that is within us
where all of Them are there,

01:07:03.220 --> 01:07:07.860
and we have to understand
that we do not exist alone.

01:07:08.660 --> 01:07:14.100
All of us are there as cells
in the whole Primordial Being,

01:07:14.100 --> 01:07:17.620
the microcosm and the macrocosm.

01:07:17.620 --> 01:07:22.820
We have to just be aware
of that wholesomeness within us.

01:07:22.820 --> 01:07:27.780
Anything that prohibits that,
that makes you smaller and narrower,

01:07:27.780 --> 01:07:30.900
you must give it up,
and become the Whole.

01:07:30.900 --> 01:07:35.940
That’s a living thing.
If it narrows you, that religion is deadening.

01:07:35.940 --> 01:07:39.140
That’s not the one
that’s allowing you to grow.

01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:43.780
So there is no religion to be given up.
On the contrary you have to enlighten

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:48.340
the religion and enlighten others.
All of you could be Sahaja Yogis

01:07:48.340 --> 01:07:53.220
and could be anything,
because there’s nothing like Christ

01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:56.740
hanging there somewhere
and Mary hanging there. No,

01:07:56.740 --> 01:08:01.140
they are part and parcel of the Whole.
They are there.

01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:05.780
You cannot just take them out.
And there cannot be many religions,

01:08:05.780 --> 01:08:09.460
there can be only one religion,
that’s a human religion

01:08:09.460 --> 01:08:13.460
which makes you higher personalities,
makes you grow.

01:08:13.460 --> 01:08:17.540
So you don’t have to give up anything,
but you yourself won’t do many things,

01:08:17.540 --> 01:08:20.580
yourself won’t do many things
because you’ll understand

01:08:20.580 --> 01:08:25.300
whatever is living is living,
that’s what you’ll start following.

01:08:25.300 --> 01:08:30.660
We have in our prayers all the prayers,
Jew prayers and Christian prayers

01:08:30.660 --> 01:08:34.340
and Hindu prayers and all the prayers
of all the religions

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.860
because they are all mantras,
they are all the chantings,

01:08:37.860 --> 01:08:40.580
and they are so important
for different chakras.

01:08:40.580 --> 01:08:48.580
So you see your universality
also gets aware of your own being,

01:08:48.580 --> 01:08:52.100
expressed in different,
these great Deities.

01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.220
They are within us
and They are awakened and you are surprised.

01:08:55.220 --> 01:08:58.340
The Kundalini won’t rise unless
and until you break.

01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:04.020
Some Christians catch on the Agnya.
Imagine. They mostly catch on the Agnya.

01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:08.820
Agnya chakra is the chakra of Christ.
Why? Because they have not understood Him.

01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:12.180
So He Himself is angry.
So you have to ask a question

01:09:12.180 --> 01:09:15.620
that is Christ the Son of God? Yes.
And then you have to ask

01:09:15.620 --> 01:09:19.540
My Relationship with Him
and then you’ll get your Kundalini rising.

01:09:19.540 --> 01:09:24.420
I’m here to represent All of Them,
to explain, to prove all the Scriptures

01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:27.780
of the world.
That nothing was wrong, nobody was false,

01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:32.100
and I’m here to prove All of Them to you,
by not denouncing anybody

01:09:32.100 --> 01:09:35.700
or not possessing anything,
in the same way you are going to become

01:09:35.700 --> 01:09:37.380
great people. All right?

01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:42.400
Thank you very much.

01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400
[Yogi talks]

01:10:14.740 --> 01:10:17.120
That’s the proof of the pudding.

01:10:17.120 --> 01:10:19.607
[Yogi talks]

01:11:17.396 --> 01:11:27.140
There you will discover
that your own powers are manifesting,

01:11:27.140 --> 01:11:30.820
which have not manifested so far.
This is the thing.

01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:35.460
We have done everything under the sun,
in the name of God and seeking

01:11:35.460 --> 01:11:41.140
but now for the first time
you’ll find your own powers manifesting.

01:11:41.140 --> 01:11:43.540
If your Mother has Powers
what does it matter?

01:11:43.540 --> 01:11:46.180
Anybody has powers
what does it matter.

01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:49.460
You have not manifested
your own powers so far.

01:11:49.460 --> 01:11:53.300
If you have the Spirit
then you must manifest your powers isn’t it.

01:11:53.300 --> 01:11:57.940
That’s most important.
And this is the religion of the Spirit.

01:11:58.740 --> 01:12:08.500
Spirit is beyond any conformity
or any sort of a narrowness.

01:12:08.500 --> 01:12:12.900
It is universal.
So this is the religion of spirit

01:12:12.900 --> 01:12:17.540
and in the realm of Spirit
you’ll be amazed,

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.260
the working of this power
of all-pervading Love.

01:12:22.260 --> 01:12:25.780
You will find out that whatever
you have been struggling with

01:12:25.780 --> 01:12:31.220
is nothing but a myth
and everything will drop out

01:12:31.220 --> 01:12:35.540
and you’ll be amazed
at your own powers.

01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:40.420
Do come all of you.
I’ll be there waiting for you.

01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:44.040
Could we have your hands towards Me.
And close your eyes.

01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:54.660
I hope you are taking vibrations
from the photograph

01:12:54.660 --> 01:12:58.180
and using it in the night.
Please do it because that will really

01:12:58.180 --> 01:13:01.380
give you advancement.
Some of you will find

01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:05.860
from the photograph when you place
your hands there will be a flickering

01:13:05.860 --> 01:13:10.500
in the flame.
Just now also there’s a flickering

01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:14.500
going on.
So do not get disturbed with that.

01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:18.020
If there is flickering, that means
there’s something wrong somewhere

01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:21.300
which is being corrected
by the photograph’s vibrations.

01:13:21.300 --> 01:13:25.700
Do not be upset if there is
any flickering because it,

01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:30.980
you’ll understand later on what it means
and how to look at it.

01:13:30.980 --> 01:13:32.580
So don’t worry on that part.

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:38.820
Now put your hands towards Me
just like this. Both the hands.

01:13:38.820 --> 01:13:43.300
He’s putting the hands like this.
On your lap. On your lap.

01:13:43.300 --> 01:13:47.620
Please put your both the hands
on your lap.

01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:50.980
And close your eyes.
Just close your eyes. It works.

01:13:50.980 --> 01:14:02.100
It works. It is kept there for that.
It manifests. It just manifests.

01:14:02.100 --> 01:14:06.900
It is very difficult as described
in many books. It is a difficult thing.

01:14:06.900 --> 01:14:12.500
But maybe that I have something about Me
that it happens.

01:14:12.500 --> 01:14:15.940
It was to happen in My Presence
so it is happening.

01:14:15.940 --> 01:14:21.300
So please have it and get it
properly established within yourselves.

01:14:21.300 --> 01:14:26.820
You are the seekers
and I have to give your own rights.

01:14:26.820 --> 01:14:31.780
So just have it.
No obligations on Me or on you.

01:14:31.780 --> 01:14:38.500
Just have it because it’s your own.
I’m duty bound to give you that.

01:14:38.500 --> 01:14:41.060
Close your eyes.
Please close your eyes.

01:14:41.060 --> 01:14:44.260
Keep your eyes shut
because if you do not close your eyes

01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:47.540
the Kundalini doesn’t rise
above Agnya chakra.

01:14:47.540 --> 01:14:56.580
So please keep your eyes shut,
absolutely shut.

01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:59.620
Again the left Nabhi is catching.
As I told you.

01:14:59.620 --> 01:15:03.300
Now you forgive your wife
and forgive your husband.

01:15:03.300 --> 01:15:07.780
Just imagine what a small thing
is catching this evolutionary process.

01:15:07.780 --> 01:15:14.100
Just forgive your husband,
forgive your wife, forgive your mother.

01:15:14.100 --> 01:15:16.260
Just forgive them.

01:15:16.260 --> 01:15:20.480
Just forget them for the time being
I would say, and forgive them.

01:15:52.260 --> 01:15:57.620
Better.

01:15:57.620 --> 01:16:00.020
Left.

01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:13.140
Now don’t feel guilty. Please.
Say Mother I am not guilty. Please.

01:16:13.140 --> 01:16:16.580
In your heart you should say,
from your heart that:

01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:29.140
“I am not guilty Mother”.
Say it at least thrice.

01:16:34.980 --> 01:16:41.860
You have to forgive yourself.
Please forgive yourself.

01:16:41.860 --> 01:16:47.300
That’s the main point is
you must learn to forgive yourself.

01:16:47.300 --> 01:16:51.700
When I say you have to forgive others
then you start cursing yourself.

01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:57.220
I mean to say forgive everyone,
inclusive of yourself also.

01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:21.940
just think of it.
Will you please say within your heart

01:17:21.940 --> 01:17:25.860
that: “Mother I am not guilty”.
Will you say that.

01:17:25.860 --> 01:17:35.220
Please say it again and again.

01:17:35.220 --> 01:17:40.100
It is sometimes unbearable for Me
to see how you people are angry

01:17:40.100 --> 01:17:56.340
with yourself. You should love yourself.
After all you are the temple of God,

01:17:56.340 --> 01:18:01.540
isn’t it.
Isn’t it your Kundalini going to rise,

01:18:01.540 --> 01:18:06.020
isn’t it.
Is nothing of My manifestation,

01:18:06.020 --> 01:18:10.180
is your manifestation,
so you have to be some special people

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:11.380
isn’t it.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:16.340
Then you must respect yourself,
and do not feel guilty,

01:18:16.340 --> 01:18:21.940
I don’t know from where does this come in.

01:18:30.100 --> 01:18:37.060
Better. All right, say it loud:

01:18:37.060 --> 01:18:41.380
“Mother I am not guilty”.
Let’s see all of you saying that.

01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:51.729
Say it. Again. Everyone.

01:19:20.420 --> 01:19:24.820
Even for taking alcohol
don’t be guilty.

01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:33.700
It’s all past it’s past.
God is the Ocean of Love and Compassion,

01:19:33.700 --> 01:19:37.180
so much so that these pangs
of your so-called little,

01:19:37.180 --> 01:19:44.660
little bit of guilts are of no value,
have no significance in the flow of His Love,

01:19:44.660 --> 01:19:48.420
so please do not find guilty
because I have said it

01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:50.740
that alcohol goes against awareness.

01:19:50.740 --> 01:19:53.620
Not for me.
Maybe for some people it does,

01:19:53.620 --> 01:19:56.900
but not for me.
It’s all finished and gone.

01:19:56.900 --> 01:20:01.800
Do not feel guilty for anything
that you have done. Please.

01:20:10.820 --> 01:20:15.780
Just know that you are the one
who is going to become a temple of God.

01:20:15.780 --> 01:20:18.660
You are the one who has to enter
into the Kingdom of God.

01:20:18.660 --> 01:20:22.660
The criminals do not enter.

01:20:22.660 --> 01:20:27.300
Like the great children of God
you have to enter,

01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:34.280
not with any guilt,
but like proud people.

01:20:52.100 --> 01:21:05.620
Better.
I think there’s a possession

01:21:05.620 --> 01:21:08.340
that tells you that you have done
this wrong or that wrong.

01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:23.460
Just don’t listen to anyone.
Now ask for your realization.

01:21:23.460 --> 01:21:31.414
It’s your due. Just ask for it.
In all dignity you ask for it.

01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:30.980
Start feeling the cool breeze
in the hand.

01:22:43.620 --> 01:22:48.740
Now see with your hands on your head
if there’s cool breeze coming in.

01:22:48.740 --> 01:23:00.340
Left hand.
I think you’ll feel there first

01:23:00.340 --> 01:23:14.180
in your hands, so many of you.
Getting it? Yes, good.

01:23:19.780 --> 01:23:24.680
Now ask forgiveness from Christ.
All right.

01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:46.100
You feel very relaxed.

01:23:46.100 --> 01:23:51.860
Those who are not getting cool breeze
have to learn to forgive first of all.

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.740
Then your thoughts will stop.
You must forgive.

01:23:54.740 --> 01:23:56.580
If you get thoughts you just say:
“I forgive”.

01:23:56.580 --> 01:24:03.060
You watch Me and you can get thoughtless.
Just say: ‘I forgive’.

01:24:03.060 --> 01:24:09.140
Then you have to ask for forgiveness.
So the heart opens out.

01:24:09.140 --> 01:24:11.700
Just forgiveness.
Asking doesn’t mean that I’m guilty.

01:24:11.700 --> 01:24:14.660
If you have asked for forgiveness
it is given.

01:24:14.660 --> 01:24:17.220
So then you don’t sit down and say:
“I’m guilty”.

01:24:17.220 --> 01:24:22.480
Once you are forgiven then why are you
saying: “I am guilty”?

01:24:28.500 --> 01:24:36.980
Good. Are you getting it or not?
This gentleman. Tingle, on the right?

01:24:37.780 --> 01:24:42.020
Heat on the right?
Now put your left hand on your liver.

01:24:42.020 --> 01:24:45.380
If you have heat on the right.
Now let’s work out all the permutations

01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:48.660
and combinations.
If you have heat on the right hand,

01:24:48.660 --> 01:24:55.460
then put your left hand on the liver.
Here. Liver.

01:24:55.460 --> 01:25:01.060
Liver is here, under your rib,
on the right hand side.

01:25:01.060 --> 01:25:07.380
Just see if you have.
Then put your left hand, left hand.

01:25:07.380 --> 01:25:15.540
Right hand towards Me
and left hand here on the liver.

01:25:15.540 --> 01:25:19.620
Now if you have no breeze on the left,
and more on the right,

01:25:19.620 --> 01:25:23.620
put your right on the heart
and left towards Me.

01:25:23.620 --> 01:25:30.340
Left towards Me. Heart is here.
Little lower. Little higher for you.

01:25:30.340 --> 01:25:37.380
Little lower for you. Little higher.
For you little higher. Yes.

01:25:37.380 --> 01:25:42.500
Little higher. Little higher is the heart.
Pushing. No, no, left.

01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:49.780
Right hand towards Me. Yes.
Little higher. This side. Yes.

01:25:49.780 --> 01:25:56.260
Left hand towards Me
and right hand on the heart.

01:25:56.260 --> 01:25:59.460
Now, ask for forgiveness,
at this point.

01:25:59.460 --> 01:26:03.700
That means your attention has not been
towards your Spirit,

01:26:03.700 --> 01:26:05.860
as it should have been
so just for ask for forgiveness

01:26:05.860 --> 01:26:08.820
but then don’t feel guilty
because the next step is that,

01:26:08.820 --> 01:26:20.260
where we jump in.
Just ask for forgiveness. Try it. Better.

01:26:20.260 --> 01:26:26.020
Are you getting on the left or not?
Getting right? All right then, you got it.

01:26:26.020 --> 01:26:28.900
That’s the thing.
That is beyond reasoning,

01:26:30.500 --> 01:26:35.940
without any arguments. It’s a happening.
It’s like a sprouting of the seed,

01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:42.660
which has taken place,
which can be only achieved,

01:26:42.660 --> 01:26:46.820
because you have that within you.
The seed which doesn’t have

01:26:46.820 --> 01:26:51.380
the germinating power,
cannot be germinated.

01:26:54.420 --> 01:26:57.540
But now you have to know
how to use this power,

01:26:57.540 --> 01:27:00.740
this Divine power of Love
for your betterment,

01:27:00.740 --> 01:27:06.340
for the betterment of others
and for the betterment of the whole humanity,

01:27:06.340 --> 01:27:09.220
for the emancipation and evolution.
Is it all right?

01:27:09.220 --> 01:27:15.767
Q: What did the heat
in the right hand mean?

01:27:15.767 --> 01:27:20.580
Shri Mataji: Means your liver is little,
out of gear. All right? Put here.

01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:26.100
Or maybe you think too much.
If you are living in the future,

01:27:26.100 --> 01:27:31.620
also you can get right hand.
Live in the future. Planning.

01:27:31.620 --> 01:27:39.300
Planning department is liver.
Those who live in the past

01:27:39.300 --> 01:27:41.926
have a left side problem.

01:27:41.926 --> 01:27:43.367
Q: I’ve got tingling in the left hand.

01:27:43.367 --> 01:27:45.460
Shri Mataji: Left hand.
And the right hand?

01:27:48.340 --> 01:27:49.700
Both combinations are there?

01:27:49.700 --> 01:27:51.447
A: No the right hand’s okay.

01:27:51.447 --> 01:27:55.620
Shri Mataji: All right. Right is all right.
Now you must have gone to some guru

01:27:55.620 --> 01:28:02.100
or somebody or to some person like that.
That means tingling. All right.

01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.820
Doesn’t matter.
You put your hand down below here,

01:28:04.820 --> 01:28:09.060
right hand, right hand. Down below.
This is the left Swadishthana

01:28:09.060 --> 01:28:12.020
and put down. And now ask for forgiveness
that I’ll never go

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:14.500
to such unauthorized people.
That’s all.

01:28:14.500 --> 01:28:17.620
You should say: “Mother are you my Guru?”
now because you have been to guru.

01:28:17.620 --> 01:28:20.820
I’m not a Guru but you can say that.
Or you can ask a question:

01:28:20.820 --> 01:28:24.820
“Mother am I my guru?”
That will also help,

01:28:24.820 --> 01:28:29.300
because that Principle,
the Principle of the Primordial Master

01:28:29.300 --> 01:28:34.020
within you is insulted.
Because by mistake you went

01:28:34.020 --> 01:28:39.780
to other people. All right?
Better now? Is improving, see.

01:28:39.780 --> 01:28:49.460
Just see that. Is so simple.
It works. It’s coming up.

01:28:49.460 --> 01:28:54.020
Now don’t think.
If you start thinking it will again go down.

01:28:54.020 --> 01:29:03.060
Just don’t think.
You watch Me without thinking.

01:29:03.060 --> 01:29:07.620
Very good.
You yourself can now turn your,

01:29:07.620 --> 01:29:10.340
tell them how to take bandhan.
He’ll show you how to do it

01:29:10.340 --> 01:29:14.980
and how to raise your Kundalini
and fix it up, which will make it possible.

01:29:15.780 --> 01:29:25.380
Put left hand towards Me.
Put it seven times.

01:29:25.380 --> 01:29:28.580
Seven times, with your hand.
Because from your hand the power is flowing.

01:29:28.580 --> 01:29:33.300
This is the first training in the power.
Just give yourself a bandhan.

01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:36.340
Means you protect your aura,
you won’t be attacked.

01:29:36.340 --> 01:29:40.180
Maybe you are going out
and some spirits might catch hold of you,

01:29:40.180 --> 01:29:43.620
and now you will know,
so before this you did not know

01:29:43.620 --> 01:29:48.340
till you ended up into lunatic asylum.
But you’ll know immediately you are caught up,

01:29:48.340 --> 01:29:50.500
because you’ll lose your vibrations.

01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:53.140
Now how to raise it,
just see how to raise it,

01:29:53.140 --> 01:29:58.580
that’s also important.
With both the hands, push it up.

01:29:58.580 --> 01:30:04.100
Go up like that. Once.
Again you can roll it like that

01:30:04.100 --> 01:30:21.460
is also good idea. Twice.
Now, ask for fixing our realization.

01:30:21.460 --> 01:30:26.660
Just ask for fixing. Thrice.
You move it and fix your realization.

01:30:26.660 --> 01:30:32.300
You can. Hah. See now, it’s better?
Much cooler now.

01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:39.860
You have to ask for it.

01:30:39.860 --> 01:30:43.780
That: “Please Mother,
fix our realization.”

01:30:43.780 --> 01:30:47.460
Then in the, then you’ll grow.
Then you are on your own

01:30:47.460 --> 01:30:53.220
and you become your own guru
and you can have your own big big,

01:30:53.220 --> 01:30:57.780
crowds and crowds of people
whom you can give realization.

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:03.620
I’ve one disciple who came to Me
and got realization,

01:31:03.620 --> 01:31:07.380
he has given realization
to ten thousand people.

01:31:07.380 --> 01:31:12.260
Ten thousand people.
So, then you will know,

01:31:12.260 --> 01:31:15.700
what you have achieved,
and how many people you’ll be curing,

01:31:15.700 --> 01:31:18.260
automatically.
You are not a healer or anything.

01:31:18.260 --> 01:31:21.460
Automatically you’ll be curing.
You are not going to heal anyone

01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:24.180
or anything.
It will just happen spontaneously.

01:31:24.180 --> 01:31:26.900
There are so many people
who are born these days,

01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:30.580
who are seeking God
and you have to give them help.

01:31:30.580 --> 01:31:35.680
Thank you very much.
I hope to see you again.
