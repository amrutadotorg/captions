00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.614
So here, what happens that when the kundalini
rises, when she goes to the Agnya Chakra

00:00:11.695 --> 00:00:16.800
which represents, as you say, the third eye or
whatever you may call it

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.413
it is between the optic chiasma, and it looks after the
pituitary and the pineal body.

00:00:23.493 --> 00:00:31.039
And as a result we have developed two institutions
called ego and superego.

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.675
The ego is the one which tells
us “I have done it. I am doing this.”

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:42.769
Both these institutions are sucked
in by the enlightenment of this center

00:00:42.849 --> 00:00:48.377
and that’s how the thing opens out,
and all your karmas are sucked in.

00:00:48.457 --> 00:00:50.507
So there’s no problem of karmas.

00:00:50.588 --> 00:00:54.800
Only human beings think that they
are doing karmas; animals don’t.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.215
They have no sense of sin or anything.

00:00:58.295 --> 00:01:01.520
They are completely under the bondage of God,

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.920
so in Sanskrit they are called as “pashu”, means “under the bondage.”

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.501
But we are the ones, we have got freedom.

00:01:07.581 --> 00:01:11.161
And that’s why we think we have done this and we have
done that;

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:13.960
and we should not do this, we should not do that.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:18.594
But when the kundalini rises and she awakens this center,

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:21.615
then both these things are sucked in.

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:23.803
And when they are sucked in,

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:28.948
then you do not do any karmas
anymore, you just are in akarma.

00:01:29.028 --> 00:01:35.460
You do everything – I mean, I travel, you know,
such a lot and I have a family, and everything is there;

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:41.490
but is just happening, I am just seeing
it, I am not doing anything as such.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.319
So when you are also awakened,
there’s no obligation, it’s just happening.

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:55.452
It is here where we should understand that this center

00:01:55.532 --> 00:02:00.940
is bestowed upon by the great life of Christ.

00:02:01.026 --> 00:02:07.887
Christ is there, and they said that He died
for our sins, died for our karmas – is a fact.

00:02:07.967 --> 00:02:14.033
Because when He is awakened
these two institutions are pulled in inside,

00:02:14.114 --> 00:02:18.877
and you get your kundalini out there – it opens out.

00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:23.278
And this bone which had been calcified opens out,

00:02:23.358 --> 00:02:26.666
and the kundalini pierces through.

00:02:26.746 --> 00:02:30.057
And this is what it is, that He died for our sins,

00:02:30.137 --> 00:02:36.222
but still the theory is extended that we
must suffer.

00:02:36.302 --> 00:02:39.034
Why should we suffer? He has suffered for us already.

00:02:39.114 --> 00:02:43.240
And is already written by Thomas, who was travelling to India via

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:47.749
Egypt where he wrote the treatise, and he said that

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.563
“Why should we suffer? Christ has already suffered for us.”

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:57.802
And he’s talked everything about Sahaja Yoga; he said
it is an experience of Self-realization, and everything.

00:02:57.882 --> 00:03:00.679
And that book now is out in England.

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:05.584
After forty-eight years they could decode the whole thing,

00:03:05.664 --> 00:03:08.581
which was found about forty-eight years back in Egypt

00:03:08.661 --> 00:03:13.797
and is out now, and is beautiful –
“Gnostics” is the name of the book.

00:03:13.877 --> 00:03:20.279
But is not so much appreciated by some
of the people, because this challenges

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:28.132
the theories of sufferings and confessions and all this nonsense.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:44.936
[Inaudible question]

00:03:45.496 --> 00:03:52.801
Me, or you? You cannot awaken yourself.

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:00.162
You see, you have to have one enlightened
candle to enlighten another candle.

00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:05.393
This candle which is not enlightened cannot enlighten itself.

00:04:05.473 --> 00:04:08.646
But there’s no obligation.

00:04:08.726 --> 00:04:14.836
But you can correct: once it is awakened
you can correct it, you can develop it.

00:04:14.916 --> 00:04:24.962
First only few hair-like strands of this energy
come up and open the fontanel bone area,

00:04:25.048 --> 00:04:32.093
and then this flow of ruh starts flowing on you

00:04:32.185 --> 00:04:39.128
and it relaxes more of the centers, so more of these strands
start coming up.

00:04:39.208 --> 00:04:45.120
So you can develop it at your will, by understanding
it,

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:49.639
but you cannot enlighten yourself by yourself.

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:54.809
Now one thing is there obstructing Sahasrara

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.850
is the movement of your Agnya into thoughts.

00:05:00.931 --> 00:05:04.774
That’s the only thing, that’s the only thing

00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:08.114
that stops your entry into Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:08.195 --> 00:05:12.328
Thoughts are coming all the time,

00:05:12.409 --> 00:05:16.688
because a human being is born who reacts to everything,

00:05:16.769 --> 00:05:21.750
react to this and react to that and the thoughts come in and the thoughts go.

00:05:21.831 --> 00:05:23.831
There’s a big crowd of thoughts.

00:05:23.962 --> 00:05:27.908
Because of that your attention cannot cross over Agnya

00:05:27.989 --> 00:05:32.229
and can reside in the Sahasrara.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.350
So first of all, one should see what sort of thoughts are coming.

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:40.191
You have to condemn yourself sometimes.

00:05:40.272 --> 00:05:43.563
You have to say: “What nonsense! What have I been doing?

00:05:43.644 --> 00:05:47.765
What’s the matter with me? How could I do all that?”

00:05:47.846 --> 00:05:52.408
Once you start doing that, these thoughts will start disappearing.

00:05:52.489 --> 00:05:55.289
These thoughts are coming from two angles,

00:05:55.369 --> 00:05:58.756
one from the ego and another from your conditionings.

00:05:58.837 --> 00:06:02.541
And these are so much built up within you,

00:06:02.622 --> 00:06:07.540
that they don’t allow your agnya to be crossed.

00:06:07.621 --> 00:06:11.902
That’s why we have two Bija mantras of ‘Hum’, ‘Kshum’.

00:06:11.983 --> 00:06:14.524
First one is, when it is conditioning,

00:06:14.605 --> 00:06:17.329
you are endowed with this kind of a fear,

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:20.118
“I shouldn’t do like this, I shouldn’t do like that,

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:23.408
it’s not allowed, that is not allowed.”

00:06:23.489 --> 00:06:25.409
That’s the conditioning part of it.

00:06:25.489 --> 00:06:27.496
Conditioning can be of many types.

00:06:27.577 --> 00:06:29.289
But the ego part of it is that,

00:06:29.369 --> 00:06:32.208
“I must overpower everybody, I must get this,

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:36.461
I must be able to rule everyone.”

00:06:36.542 --> 00:06:40.164
These two things are there in the mind

00:06:40.245 --> 00:06:43.285
which are all the time crossing over.

00:06:44.135 --> 00:06:49.175
So it’s important that we should go into thoughtless awareness

00:06:49.608 --> 00:06:54.408
and that thoughtless awareness is the real way

00:06:54.489 --> 00:07:00.104
that your Sahasrara can be nourished by the Kundalini.

00:07:00.185 --> 00:07:05.228
Because Kundalini cannot go through, it cannot pass through.

00:07:05.309 --> 00:07:09.091
And for that, as I said, there are two Bija mantras,

00:07:09.172 --> 00:07:11.409
one is ‘Hum’ another ’Kshum’.

00:07:11.489 --> 00:07:14.409
So, if you are conditioned, you are frightened,

00:07:14.489 --> 00:07:17.962
you are afraid and you had ideas about yourself.

00:07:18.043 --> 00:07:22.408
These days the way people are describing, they’ll say,
“I’m an extrovert”.

00:07:22.489 --> 00:07:24.463
Somebody will say, “I’m an introvert”,

00:07:24.544 --> 00:07:30.683
somebody will say “I’m a hippie”, “I’m that”, I’m that.

00:07:30.764 --> 00:07:34.312
All kinds of things they can have attributed to themselves.

00:07:34.409 --> 00:07:40.329
But these ideas are all coming from outside, they are not from inside.

00:07:40.409 --> 00:07:46.785
To get to the inner side of yourself, the subtler side of your being,

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:51.198
you must allow the Kundalini to go through the Agnya.

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:53.604
And to cross the Agnya is a very important thing

00:07:53.685 --> 00:07:57.772
in modern times and for that you have to meditate.

00:07:57.853 --> 00:08:02.288
If you can meditate with complete faith in yourself

00:08:02.369 --> 00:08:04.936
this Agnya can be opened out.

00:08:05.017 --> 00:08:07.596
With surrendering to the Divine,

00:08:07.677 --> 00:08:10.184
you have to surrender yourself to the Divine.

00:08:10.265 --> 00:08:14.145
And when this Agnya opens, you’ll be amazed,

00:08:14.226 --> 00:08:19.066
your Sahasrara is just waiting to transfer,

00:08:19.147 --> 00:08:25.906
to give you all the help that you need through the All-pervading Power.

00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:30.160
Your connection of Sahasrara with

00:08:30.241 --> 00:08:32.715
the All-pervading Power is established.

00:08:32.796 --> 00:08:39.329
And by that you’ll be amazed how all these seven chakras work for you,

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:44.118
how they help you, how they try to give you

00:08:44.199 --> 00:08:48.328
whatever is the real knowledge about everything.

00:08:48.409 --> 00:08:53.168
This real knowledge that you get is very joy giving.

00:08:53.249 --> 00:08:56.249
You can see this real knowledge in everything.

00:08:56.329 --> 00:09:00.038
You don’t have to start reading any book about it.

00:09:00.119 --> 00:09:05.708
In every situation and in every person, in every flower,

00:09:05.789 --> 00:09:13.249
in every natural happening, you see clearly the hand of the Divine.

00:09:13.329 --> 00:09:20.900
Once you see the hand of the Divine your egos start disappearing.

00:09:20.981 --> 00:09:25.647
Once you say that “It’s You. You do everything.”

00:09:26.316 --> 00:09:29.854
Kabira has said something great about this,

00:09:29.935 --> 00:09:38.169
he said that when the goat is alive it goes on saying

00:09:38.249 --> 00:09:42.369
“Mai, mai” - “I am, I am”.

00:09:42.449 --> 00:09:50.116
But when it is slaughtered and its intestines are made into strings,

00:09:50.197 --> 00:09:54.117
which are used for cleaning the cotton, then it said

00:09:54.198 --> 00:09:57.666
“tuhi, tuhi” - “you are, you are, you are”.

00:09:57.747 --> 00:10:01.734
See, in this symbolic way, they have suggested that:

00:10:01.815 --> 00:10:09.674
you have to become dissolved into this Divine power.

00:10:09.755 --> 00:10:13.248
“It’s the Divine power that does everything. What am I?

00:10:13.329 --> 00:10:17.943
I was just a drop and I fell into this ocean of awareness

00:10:18.024 --> 00:10:23.369
of the Divine power and that is taking over and working it out.”

00:10:23.489 --> 00:10:29.058
That will help you a lot to be a great Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:29.169 --> 00:10:34.541
You developed curing powers, but still you are not proud of it.

00:10:34.622 --> 00:10:38.921
You developed, of course, awakening powers, you are not proud of it.

00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:43.640
You develop so many creative powers and you are not proud of it.

00:10:43.721 --> 00:10:48.328
You become really very, very creative, extremely creative.

00:10:48.409 --> 00:10:50.369
But the greatest thing happend to you

00:10:50.449 --> 00:10:52.409
that you become a global personality.

00:10:52.490 --> 00:10:56.368
So you start seeing the problem of every country,

00:10:56.449 --> 00:11:00.577
of every other nation where they have problems.

00:11:00.658 --> 00:11:04.563
But these problems, when you see, you don’t see like other people.

00:11:04.655 --> 00:11:08.037
Because others may like to use it for their own purpose,

00:11:08.118 --> 00:11:10.533
maybe for media, maybe for something.

00:11:10.614 --> 00:11:15.288
But what you want to see is that these problems are solved.

00:11:15.369 --> 00:11:21.007
You see, your powers are so great, with this kind of a mind,

00:11:21.089 --> 00:11:25.816
I would say, which is dominated completely by the Divine power,

00:11:25.897 --> 00:11:31.213
that it, whatever disturbs you,

00:11:31.294 --> 00:11:36.474
immediately it’s taken over and it starts working out.

00:11:36.555 --> 00:11:40.368
Many, many problems have been solved by Sahaja Yoga

00:11:40.449 --> 00:11:44.560
and also they can be solved on a very universal level,

00:11:44.641 --> 00:11:47.561
if you are a global person.

00:11:47.642 --> 00:11:55.289
If you are a global person then what happens
is that you become a, sort of a, vehicle,

00:11:55.369 --> 00:11:59.408
or you can become like a channel for this Divine power

00:11:59.489 --> 00:12:04.289
to act because you are purely a global personality.

00:12:04.409 --> 00:12:06.369
Not attached to this, attached to that,

00:12:06.449 --> 00:12:10.734
but a pure Sahaja personality which can be used

00:12:10.815 --> 00:12:13.815
by this Divine power very easily.

00:12:13.969 --> 00:12:17.288
For that, as I told in the afternoon also,

00:12:17.369 --> 00:12:21.369
that we have to be careful about few things that we have.

00:12:21.449 --> 00:12:25.896
Firstly anger, anger is the worst thing that we have.

00:12:25.977 --> 00:12:27.057
Angry for what?

00:12:27.138 --> 00:12:31.529
There are people who talk like this - “I was very angry” -
as if they’re proud of their anger.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:36.288
Anger is a sign of complete stupidity, absolute stupidity.

00:12:36.369 --> 00:12:40.247
And there’s no need to get angry with anyone because,

00:12:40.328 --> 00:12:43.288
by anger, you don’t solve the problem.

00:12:43.369 --> 00:12:45.544
With anger you spoil yourself.

00:12:45.625 --> 00:12:50.111
With anger you ruin your own, own nature.

00:12:50.192 --> 00:12:54.112
With anger you really spoil the whole situation.

00:12:54.209 --> 00:13:01.129
So no use, no use having any anger about anything.

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:04.090
But if anything happens that angers you,

00:13:04.215 --> 00:13:06.940
you should settle down and see for yourself

00:13:07.021 --> 00:13:11.368
why is it wrong, why is it disturbing you?

00:13:11.449 --> 00:13:17.847
Your seeing itself will help this problem to be solved.

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:20.368
You must first of all realize that you are

00:13:20.449 --> 00:13:23.369
a special personality that your Sahasrara

00:13:23.449 --> 00:13:26.974
has been opened out to this all Divine power,

00:13:27.055 --> 00:13:32.270
as if you have entered into the realm of divinity.

00:13:32.409 --> 00:13:46.369
You are great guests in that great court of Divine domain.

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.856
You are not an ordinary person.

00:13:48.937 --> 00:13:54.368
And so once you understand why you have Sahaja Yoga

00:13:54.449 --> 00:14:00.152
and why you have got realization, is that there’s something special.

00:14:00.233 --> 00:14:04.368
But that should not give you any ego.

00:14:04.449 --> 00:14:07.217
It’s not for ego that you have to have this,

00:14:07.298 --> 00:14:09.218
but it’s for understanding that

00:14:09.299 --> 00:14:13.231
you have to play into the hands of the Divine.

00:14:13.312 --> 00:14:18.208
It is this play is something I could explain like this,

00:14:18.289 --> 00:14:20.409
that: if you are, supposing, an artist,

00:14:20.489 --> 00:14:23.409
then in the hand of the artist is the brush

00:14:23.489 --> 00:14:27.948
and the brush never thinks that it is doing anything.

00:14:28.029 --> 00:14:30.665
It’s the artist who is doing everything.

00:14:30.746 --> 00:14:35.368
In the same way, when you are one with the Divine power,

00:14:35.449 --> 00:14:39.601
you just feel “I’m not doing anything.

00:14:39.682 --> 00:14:42.736
It’s the Artist who’s doing it.

00:14:42.817 --> 00:14:46.090
It’s the Artist who is managing”.
And who is the Artist?

00:14:46.171 --> 00:14:50.642
It’s this Divine power, which loves you, which cares for you,

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:54.843
which looks after you, which absolutely is identified with you.
