00:00:02.111 --> 00:00:08.089
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:22.720
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

00:00:22.745 --> 00:00:27.065
for different, different purposes.

00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:40.186
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

00:00:40.211 --> 00:00:43.727
who were worshipping the Mother,

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:54.150
they found out that what
She has done for us.

00:00:55.312 --> 00:00:58.752
The other day I told you
the dharma

00:00:58.777 --> 00:01:06.322
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

00:01:06.347 --> 00:01:13.201
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

00:01:13.226 --> 00:01:18.225
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.561
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

00:01:27.177 --> 00:01:34.602
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

00:01:34.627 --> 00:01:38.351
though we are not aware of it.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.244
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

00:01:44.269 --> 00:01:49.427
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

00:01:49.452 --> 00:01:56.875
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

00:01:59.274 --> 00:02:05.764
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:15.328
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

00:02:18.058 --> 00:02:25.614
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:33.428
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

00:02:33.453 --> 00:02:40.266
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

00:02:40.291 --> 00:02:45.137
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

00:02:45.162 --> 00:02:49.914
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:57.209
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

00:02:57.234 --> 00:03:01.558
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

00:03:01.583 --> 00:03:07.514
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:17.582
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

00:03:17.607 --> 00:03:24.731
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

00:03:24.756 --> 00:03:29.008
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:35.675
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.685
So, the second one She says is:

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.697
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

00:03:46.722 --> 00:03:51.111
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:58.981
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

00:03:59.006 --> 00:04:02.211
But, it’s not there.

00:04:02.236 --> 00:04:09.267
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

00:04:11.275 --> 00:04:16.038
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

00:04:16.063 --> 00:04:18.689
and some present to another one.

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:24.401
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

00:04:24.426 --> 00:04:30.286
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

00:04:30.311 --> 00:04:39.128
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

00:04:39.153 --> 00:04:42.888
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

00:04:42.913 --> 00:04:48.222
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

00:04:48.247 --> 00:04:52.205
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:57.782
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

00:04:57.807 --> 00:05:02.443
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

00:05:02.468 --> 00:05:07.492
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

00:05:07.517 --> 00:05:16.791
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:21.373
These so close to each other.

00:05:21.398 --> 00:05:29.124
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

00:05:29.149 --> 00:05:33.594
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

00:05:33.619 --> 00:05:37.463
if You can go to that country”.

00:05:37.488 --> 00:05:40.783
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

00:05:40.808 --> 00:05:46.713
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

00:05:47.578 --> 00:05:56.875
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:05.870
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

00:06:07.676 --> 00:06:12.030
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

00:06:12.055 --> 00:06:17.550
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

00:06:17.575 --> 00:06:25.130
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

00:06:25.155 --> 00:06:29.659
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

00:06:29.684 --> 00:06:34.836
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

00:06:34.861 --> 00:06:40.179
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

00:06:40.204 --> 00:06:45.930
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

00:06:45.955 --> 00:06:49.097
Then you must compete with others.

00:06:49.122 --> 00:06:55.568
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

00:06:57.322 --> 00:07:03.772
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:12.226
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

00:07:12.251 --> 00:07:18.052
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

00:07:18.077 --> 00:07:21.559
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

00:07:21.584 --> 00:07:28.118
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

00:07:28.143 --> 00:07:31.974
Forgiveness from the heart.

00:07:31.999 --> 00:07:37.338
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

00:07:37.363 --> 00:07:40.320
has exploited you, has troubled you,

00:07:40.345 --> 00:07:46.197
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

00:07:46.222 --> 00:07:51.850
Do we use that power to forgive?

00:07:55.718 --> 00:08:03.282
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

00:08:03.307 --> 00:08:08.498
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

00:08:08.523 --> 00:08:13.498
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

00:08:13.523 --> 00:08:19.940
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

00:08:19.965 --> 00:08:24.150
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:08:24.175 --> 00:08:29.025
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.971
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

00:08:34.996 --> 00:08:39.018
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

00:08:39.043 --> 00:08:43.044
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

00:08:43.069 --> 00:08:47.522
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

00:08:48.188 --> 00:08:55.535
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

00:08:55.560 --> 00:09:00.812
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

00:09:00.837 --> 00:09:04.916
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

00:09:04.941 --> 00:09:11.870
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

00:09:11.895 --> 00:09:18.549
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

00:09:18.573 --> 00:09:26.262
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

00:09:26.287 --> 00:09:28.652
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

00:09:28.677 --> 00:09:32.133
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

00:09:32.158 --> 00:09:36.434
But when your ego is working or...

00:09:36.459 --> 00:09:40.998
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

00:09:41.023 --> 00:09:46.287
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

00:09:50.445 --> 00:09:55.531
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

00:09:55.556 --> 00:10:03.309
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

00:10:03.334 --> 00:10:07.084
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

00:10:07.109 --> 00:10:10.797
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

00:10:10.822 --> 00:10:16.639
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

00:10:16.664 --> 00:10:21.140
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

00:10:21.165 --> 00:10:25.440
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

00:10:25.465 --> 00:10:31.309
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

00:10:31.334 --> 00:10:37.203
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

00:10:37.228 --> 00:10:41.326
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

00:10:41.351 --> 00:10:44.898
So, Mother has to tell you.

00:10:50.085 --> 00:10:59.007
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

00:10:59.032 --> 00:11:05.395
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:09.215
She puts you into delusion,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:13.957
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

00:11:13.982 --> 00:11:20.338
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

00:11:20.363 --> 00:11:25.966
She allows, allows you to go wrong

00:11:25.991 --> 00:11:30.687
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

00:11:30.712 --> 00:11:33.948
Very important it is that She plays,

00:11:33.973 --> 00:11:37.700
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

00:11:37.725 --> 00:11:41.891
And this is discussed
in every religion

00:11:41.916 --> 00:11:46.760
that we get lost with this delusion.

00:11:46.785 --> 00:11:51.364
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

00:11:51.389 --> 00:11:55.294
We have the delusions
of ego.

00:11:55.319 --> 00:12:00.572
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

00:12:00.597 --> 00:12:07.147
that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

00:12:07.172 --> 00:12:11.562
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

00:12:11.587 --> 00:12:16.428
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

00:12:16.453 --> 00:12:24.946
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

00:12:24.971 --> 00:12:30.093
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

00:12:30.118 --> 00:12:35.179
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

00:12:35.204 --> 00:12:40.443
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

00:12:40.468 --> 00:12:44.835
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

00:12:45.325 --> 00:12:51.910
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

00:12:51.935 --> 00:12:54.998
then only you can return back.

00:12:55.023 --> 00:12:59.332
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

00:12:59.357 --> 00:13:10.616
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

00:13:10.641 --> 00:13:15.381
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

00:13:15.406 --> 00:13:21.967
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:28.002
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

00:13:28.027 --> 00:13:31.325
It is beyond the mind.

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:38.358
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

00:13:38.734 --> 00:13:46.010
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

00:13:46.035 --> 00:13:52.964
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

00:13:52.989 --> 00:13:57.437
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

00:13:57.462 --> 00:14:01.495
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:04.964
and this connection should not
be broken,

00:14:04.989 --> 00:14:10.077
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

00:14:10.102 --> 00:14:13.753
All this is within us,

00:14:14.391 --> 00:14:20.099
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

00:14:20.124 --> 00:14:26.985
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

00:14:27.010 --> 00:14:32.078
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

00:14:32.103 --> 00:14:39.811
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

00:14:39.836 --> 00:14:45.731
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

00:14:45.756 --> 00:14:52.419
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

00:14:52.444 --> 00:14:56.881
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

00:14:56.906 --> 00:15:04.639
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

00:15:04.664 --> 00:15:10.164
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

00:15:10.189 --> 00:15:12.298
For example, it is also said that,

00:15:12.323 --> 00:15:19.235
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:15:20.052 --> 00:15:25.671
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

00:15:25.696 --> 00:15:34.747
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

00:15:36.011 --> 00:15:42.711
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

00:15:42.736 --> 00:15:47.314
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

00:15:47.339 --> 00:15:52.506
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

00:15:53.557 --> 00:15:56.723
Lajja rupena samsthita:

00:15:56.748 --> 00:16:02.915
means you have to have shame
of your body.

00:16:03.804 --> 00:16:07.582
That’s specially for women.

00:16:07.607 --> 00:16:16.238
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

00:16:16.263 --> 00:16:19.319
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

00:16:19.344 --> 00:16:22.282
That shyness gradually disappears,

00:16:22.307 --> 00:16:25.782
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

00:16:25.807 --> 00:16:30.242
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

00:16:30.267 --> 00:16:35.393
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

00:16:36.002 --> 00:16:39.372
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

00:16:39.397 --> 00:16:44.611
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

00:16:44.636 --> 00:16:49.492
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

00:16:49.517 --> 00:16:54.588
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

00:16:54.613 --> 00:16:59.622
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

00:16:59.647 --> 00:17:04.528
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

00:17:04.553 --> 00:17:08.628
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

00:17:08.653 --> 00:17:11.962
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

00:17:11.987 --> 00:17:15.646
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

00:17:15.671 --> 00:17:22.531
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

00:17:22.556 --> 00:17:29.708
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

00:17:29.733 --> 00:17:38.438
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

00:17:38.463 --> 00:17:45.858
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

00:17:45.883 --> 00:17:50.675
There is no space for any artist

00:17:50.700 --> 00:18:00.327
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

00:18:00.352 --> 00:18:07.392
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

00:18:07.417 --> 00:18:11.601
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

00:18:11.626 --> 00:18:19.269
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

00:18:19.704 --> 00:18:24.917
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

00:18:24.942 --> 00:18:28.568
then it is His art,

00:18:28.593 --> 00:18:36.258
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

00:18:36.283 --> 00:18:41.235
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:45.494
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

00:18:45.519 --> 00:18:49.103
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

00:18:49.128 --> 00:18:52.797
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

00:18:52.822 --> 00:18:59.048
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

00:18:59.564 --> 00:19:05.346
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

00:19:05.371 --> 00:19:09.444
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

00:19:09.469 --> 00:19:14.661
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

00:19:14.686 --> 00:19:18.353
and we start behaving in their
manner,

00:19:18.378 --> 00:19:21.404
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:26.787
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

00:19:26.812 --> 00:19:31.382
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

00:19:31.407 --> 00:19:35.534
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

00:19:35.559 --> 00:19:38.323
they would never have accepted
them.

00:19:38.348 --> 00:19:41.405
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

00:19:41.430 --> 00:19:44.775
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:50.368
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

00:19:50.393 --> 00:19:57.179
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

00:19:57.204 --> 00:20:02.070
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

00:20:02.095 --> 00:20:06.518
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

00:20:06.543 --> 00:20:13.090
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

00:20:13.115 --> 00:20:16.744
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

00:20:16.769 --> 00:20:21.886
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

00:20:21.911 --> 00:20:27.138
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

00:20:27.163 --> 00:20:31.052
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

00:20:31.077 --> 00:20:35.137
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

00:20:35.162 --> 00:20:38.613
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

00:20:38.638 --> 00:20:46.679
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

00:20:46.704 --> 00:20:50.591
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

00:20:50.616 --> 00:20:54.689
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

00:20:54.714 --> 00:21:01.244
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

00:21:01.270 --> 00:21:06.673
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

00:21:06.698 --> 00:21:14.393
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

00:21:14.418 --> 00:21:17.596
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

00:21:17.621 --> 00:21:21.200
or to worship the idols or anything,

00:21:21.225 --> 00:21:29.655
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:35.365
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

00:21:35.390 --> 00:21:42.601
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

00:21:42.626 --> 00:21:46.768
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

00:21:46.793 --> 00:21:49.803
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

00:21:49.828 --> 00:21:56.589
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:21:56.614 --> 00:22:02.582
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

00:22:02.607 --> 00:22:06.983
and this and that, and give
justification.

00:22:07.008 --> 00:22:11.566
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

00:22:11.591 --> 00:22:14.791
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

00:22:14.816 --> 00:22:18.244
and who are misbehaving.

00:22:18.269 --> 00:22:24.078
You must do what a saint should do.

00:22:24.532 --> 00:22:28.729
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

00:22:28.754 --> 00:22:33.615
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:40.046
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

00:22:40.071 --> 00:22:44.163
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

00:22:44.188 --> 00:22:47.806
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

00:22:47.831 --> 00:22:53.126
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:57.587
You can change the things
that you are eating,

00:22:57.612 --> 00:23:03.212
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

00:23:03.237 --> 00:23:10.822
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

00:23:11.217 --> 00:23:15.943
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

00:23:15.968 --> 00:23:20.836
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

00:23:20.861 --> 00:23:25.201
But all the time worried about
their body.

00:23:25.226 --> 00:23:31.877
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

00:23:31.902 --> 00:23:40.307
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

00:23:41.169 --> 00:23:45.244
Fashion is madness.

00:23:46.459 --> 00:23:52.786
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

00:23:52.811 --> 00:23:55.514
But in India also fashion started.

00:23:55.539 --> 00:23:59.982
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

00:24:00.008 --> 00:24:06.613
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

00:24:06.638 --> 00:24:10.891
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:13.121
You have a particular design,

00:24:13.146 --> 00:24:17.128
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

00:24:17.153 --> 00:24:20.825
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

00:24:20.850 --> 00:24:25.794
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

00:24:25.819 --> 00:24:32.143
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

00:24:32.168 --> 00:24:39.115
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

00:24:39.156 --> 00:24:44.140
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

00:24:44.165 --> 00:24:48.654
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

00:24:48.679 --> 00:24:53.746
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

00:24:53.771 --> 00:24:58.897
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

00:24:58.922 --> 00:25:04.191
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

00:25:04.216 --> 00:25:10.840
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

00:25:10.865 --> 00:25:14.512
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

00:25:14.537 --> 00:25:17.370
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

00:25:17.418 --> 00:25:23.201
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

00:25:23.817 --> 00:25:29.831
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

00:25:29.855 --> 00:25:33.212
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

00:25:33.237 --> 00:25:38.830
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

00:25:38.855 --> 00:25:42.711
- you have to exercise and meditate.

00:25:42.736 --> 00:25:47.284
If you meditate you become peaceful.

00:25:47.309 --> 00:25:52.788
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

00:25:52.821 --> 00:26:01.196
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

00:26:01.221 --> 00:26:04.609
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

00:26:04.634 --> 00:26:09.218
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

00:26:09.243 --> 00:26:15.071
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

00:26:15.096 --> 00:26:22.101
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

00:26:22.126 --> 00:26:27.403
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

00:26:27.428 --> 00:26:35.040
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

00:26:35.065 --> 00:26:39.794
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

00:26:39.819 --> 00:26:44.580
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

00:26:44.605 --> 00:26:48.148
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

00:26:48.173 --> 00:26:50.900
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

00:26:50.925 --> 00:26:55.327
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

00:26:55.352 --> 00:26:59.223
The joy of that artist is finished.

00:26:59.248 --> 00:27:05.244
You cannot get that joy,

00:27:06.601 --> 00:27:14.327
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

00:27:14.352 --> 00:27:19.563
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

00:27:19.588 --> 00:27:25.441
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

00:27:25.466 --> 00:27:28.713
and it makes the life so miserable.

00:27:28.738 --> 00:27:33.436
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

00:27:33.461 --> 00:27:39.249
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

00:27:39.274 --> 00:27:44.497
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

00:27:44.522 --> 00:27:48.373
problems of sometimes snowing.

00:27:48.405 --> 00:27:51.649
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

00:27:51.674 --> 00:27:55.075
and it’s very well done, we got it.

00:27:55.100 --> 00:28:01.015
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.676
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

00:28:07.701 --> 00:28:12.959
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

00:28:12.984 --> 00:28:17.545
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

00:28:17.570 --> 00:28:23.819
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

00:28:23.844 --> 00:28:27.520
of these Italians, so-called.

00:28:27.545 --> 00:28:31.991
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

00:28:32.016 --> 00:28:36.630
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

00:28:36.655 --> 00:28:41.423
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

00:28:41.448 --> 00:28:45.935
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:53.027
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

00:28:53.648 --> 00:28:56.843
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

00:28:56.868 --> 00:29:02.253
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

00:29:02.278 --> 00:29:05.885
With a simple thing like that.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:12.844
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

00:29:12.869 --> 00:29:16.055
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:18.961
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

00:29:18.986 --> 00:29:22.286
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:27.362
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

00:29:27.387 --> 00:29:32.263
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

00:29:32.288 --> 00:29:36.801
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

00:29:36.826 --> 00:29:42.113
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

00:29:42.138 --> 00:29:47.964
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

00:29:47.989 --> 00:29:55.685
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

00:29:55.710 --> 00:30:03.598
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

00:30:03.623 --> 00:30:08.952
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

00:30:08.977 --> 00:30:15.261
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

00:30:15.286 --> 00:30:22.133
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

00:30:28.384 --> 00:30:38.369
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

00:30:38.394 --> 00:30:46.099
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

00:30:46.124 --> 00:30:50.064
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

00:30:50.089 --> 00:30:53.668
What is the need to think?”.

00:30:54.419 --> 00:31:01.026
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

00:31:01.051 --> 00:31:05.274
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

00:31:05.299 --> 00:31:09.223
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

00:31:09.248 --> 00:31:14.582
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

00:31:14.607 --> 00:31:20.622
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

00:31:20.647 --> 00:31:30.101
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

00:31:30.126 --> 00:31:32.954
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

00:31:32.979 --> 00:31:39.601
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

00:31:39.626 --> 00:31:43.286
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

00:31:43.311 --> 00:31:47.792
What is the need to go to Mars?

00:31:47.817 --> 00:31:52.259
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

00:31:52.284 --> 00:31:54.978
First they came to India, then went
to China,

00:31:55.003 --> 00:32:01.223
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

00:32:01.248 --> 00:32:05.370
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

00:32:05.395 --> 00:32:09.954
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

00:32:09.979 --> 00:32:15.002
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

00:32:15.035 --> 00:32:18.869
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

00:32:18.894 --> 00:32:22.278
then they’ll jump in.

00:32:22.303 --> 00:32:27.539
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

00:32:27.564 --> 00:32:31.608
Because monkeys won’t do that.

00:32:31.633 --> 00:32:38.623
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

00:32:38.648 --> 00:32:43.839
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

00:32:43.864 --> 00:32:49.119
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

00:32:49.144 --> 00:32:54.101
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

00:32:54.126 --> 00:32:56.405
They have no time!

00:32:56.430 --> 00:33:00.670
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

00:33:00.695 --> 00:33:05.845
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

00:33:05.870 --> 00:33:10.004
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

00:33:10.029 --> 00:33:13.495
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:16.942
For meditation they have no time.

00:33:16.967 --> 00:33:24.925
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

00:33:25.345 --> 00:33:32.456
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

00:33:33.929 --> 00:33:39.665
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

00:33:40.676 --> 00:33:46.481
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

00:33:46.506 --> 00:33:53.637
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

00:33:54.312 --> 00:33:58.741
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

00:33:58.766 --> 00:34:03.180
But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

00:34:03.205 --> 00:34:07.474
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

00:34:07.499 --> 00:34:09.743
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

00:34:09.768 --> 00:34:15.726
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

00:34:15.751 --> 00:34:19.894
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

00:34:19.919 --> 00:34:23.043
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

00:34:23.068 --> 00:34:26.057
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

00:34:26.082 --> 00:34:30.047
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

00:34:30.072 --> 00:34:38.103
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

00:34:38.607 --> 00:34:44.119
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

00:34:44.144 --> 00:34:48.734
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

00:34:48.759 --> 00:34:54.680
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

00:34:54.705 --> 00:35:00.394
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

00:35:00.419 --> 00:35:08.211
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

00:35:08.236 --> 00:35:17.554
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

00:35:18.087 --> 00:35:25.236
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

00:35:25.261 --> 00:35:27.745
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:34.564
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

00:35:35.088 --> 00:35:38.680
So they also wanted to see.

00:35:38.705 --> 00:35:47.289
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

00:35:49.163 --> 00:35:55.216
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

00:35:55.241 --> 00:35:58.837
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

00:35:58.862 --> 00:36:04.546
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

00:36:04.571 --> 00:36:07.069
Did you follow this point?

00:36:07.094 --> 00:36:14.949
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

00:36:14.974 --> 00:36:20.389
where you are yourself that.

00:36:20.837 --> 00:36:25.385
So, how can you see yourself?

00:36:25.410 --> 00:36:29.639
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

00:36:29.664 --> 00:36:33.564
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

00:36:33.589 --> 00:36:39.776
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

00:36:39.801 --> 00:36:44.992
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

00:36:45.017 --> 00:36:49.186
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

00:36:49.211 --> 00:36:57.221
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

00:36:57.501 --> 00:37:02.857
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

00:37:02.882 --> 00:37:09.940
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

00:37:10.306 --> 00:37:16.736
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

00:37:16.761 --> 00:37:24.932
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

00:37:26.282 --> 00:37:34.090
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

00:37:34.115 --> 00:37:41.419
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

00:37:41.444 --> 00:37:47.274
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

00:37:47.299 --> 00:37:54.329
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

00:37:54.354 --> 00:38:00.709
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

00:38:00.734 --> 00:38:05.532
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

00:38:05.557 --> 00:38:11.594
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

00:38:11.619 --> 00:38:15.709
Whatever I may try on My own

00:38:15.734 --> 00:38:20.348
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

00:38:20.373 --> 00:38:27.874
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

00:38:27.899 --> 00:38:40.279
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

00:38:40.304 --> 00:38:44.377
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

00:38:44.402 --> 00:38:49.291
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

00:38:49.316 --> 00:38:55.749
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

00:38:55.774 --> 00:39:03.815
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

00:39:05.258 --> 00:39:08.130
You use them.

00:39:09.545 --> 00:39:12.133
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

00:39:12.158 --> 00:39:18.184
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

00:39:18.209 --> 00:39:25.122
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

00:39:25.147 --> 00:39:29.307
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

00:39:29.332 --> 00:39:38.826
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

00:39:39.131 --> 00:39:45.696
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.398
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

00:39:50.423 --> 00:39:57.783
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

00:39:57.808 --> 00:40:03.749
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

00:40:03.774 --> 00:40:11.252
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

00:40:11.277 --> 00:40:17.218
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

00:40:17.243 --> 00:40:26.091
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

00:40:26.340 --> 00:40:34.396
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

00:40:34.421 --> 00:40:37.063
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

00:40:37.088 --> 00:40:40.669
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

00:40:40.694 --> 00:40:46.038
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

00:40:46.063 --> 00:40:51.783
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

00:40:51.808 --> 00:40:57.057
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

00:40:57.082 --> 00:40:59.812
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

00:40:59.837 --> 00:41:04.201
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

00:41:04.226 --> 00:41:08.793
He started looking at me
like this.’”

00:41:09.441 --> 00:41:11.586
So, with the Kundalini awakening

00:41:11.611 --> 00:41:17.300
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

00:41:17.325 --> 00:41:22.792
And then your generosity,

00:41:24.439 --> 00:41:30.961
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

00:41:30.986 --> 00:41:37.835
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

00:41:39.318 --> 00:41:47.602
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

00:41:47.627 --> 00:41:52.734
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

00:41:52.759 --> 00:41:55.181
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

00:41:55.206 --> 00:42:02.925
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

00:42:02.950 --> 00:42:07.529
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

00:42:07.554 --> 00:42:17.365
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

00:42:17.390 --> 00:42:21.606
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

00:42:21.631 --> 00:42:31.528
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

00:42:31.553 --> 00:42:37.774
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

00:42:37.799 --> 00:42:43.485
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

00:42:43.510 --> 00:42:48.358
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

00:42:48.383 --> 00:42:54.325
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

00:42:54.350 --> 00:43:00.906
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

00:43:00.931 --> 00:43:03.473
They are just within you,

00:43:03.498 --> 00:43:10.043
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

00:43:10.068 --> 00:43:15.158
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

00:43:15.183 --> 00:43:22.322
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

00:43:22.347 --> 00:43:26.933
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

00:43:26.958 --> 00:43:30.800
May God bless you all.
