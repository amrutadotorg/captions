WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:06.000
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

00:06.626 --> 00:10.626
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

00:13.209 --> 00:16.584
For example, today is Wednesday

00:17.000 --> 00:20.000
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

00:21.000 --> 00:23.542
because I was born on Wednesday.

00:24.375 --> 00:28.375
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

00:28.459 --> 00:30.459
we’ll be able to manage it

00:30.501 --> 00:32.501
because I was born at twelve.

00:33.000 --> 00:36.000
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

00:36.417 --> 00:41.417
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

00:41.459 --> 00:44.000
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

00:44.000 --> 00:47.209
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

00:47.459 --> 00:53.167
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

00:53.292 --> 00:55.417
that you all are ready for a Puja

00:55.459 --> 01:01.125
and that we could break this rule also,

01:01.167 --> 01:04.501
after such a long time,

01:04.501 --> 01:11.000
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

01:11.000 --> 01:12.584
I was trying, trying, trying

01:12.626 --> 01:16.042
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

01:22.000 --> 01:27.000
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

01:28.000 --> 01:33.417
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

01:35.334 --> 01:40.334
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

01:42.000 --> 01:44.000
and I don’t know how far

01:44.000 --> 01:48.000
I can go with the description of this great country

01:48.375 --> 01:51.375
which we call as Greece.

01:53.000 --> 02:01.542
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

02:02.000 --> 02:07.375
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

02:08.000 --> 02:10.459
and a “dweep” is a island.

02:10.459 --> 02:15.417
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

02:15.584 --> 02:20.459
and there is a temple of Athena,

02:21.000 --> 02:27.334
all been described about Her temple, about Her

02:30.250 --> 02:33.250
jewelry, dress and everything.

02:34.083 --> 02:38.083
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

02:38.250 --> 02:42.250
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

02:43.167 --> 02:46.459
So now, one may say that,

02:46.459 --> 02:48.709
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

02:49.000 --> 02:52.000
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

02:52.584 --> 02:55.000
One may ask a question like that,

02:55.000 --> 03:02.000
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

03:03.000 --> 03:09.000
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

03:11.417 --> 03:16.417
before the Creation was created in the material form,

03:17.375 --> 03:20.375
where it was planned,

03:23.000 --> 03:26.584
then there was something of the –

03:27.000 --> 03:29.000
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

03:31.000 --> 03:38.501
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

03:40.042 --> 03:45.417
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

03:46.000 --> 03:55.083
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

03:55.667 --> 04:01.334
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

04:01.375 --> 04:04.375
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

04:04.375 --> 04:06.667
and create vibrations there.

04:07.417 --> 04:11.667
Now in the material form the Gokul was

04:11.667 --> 04:15.292
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

04:17.334 --> 04:24.209
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

04:25.167 --> 04:31.042
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

04:31.292 --> 04:35.709
in this area, to create the vibrations.

04:36.167 --> 04:38.626
So it is not only She was a Goddess

04:39.292 --> 04:41.584
but She lived in this area

04:42.000 --> 04:45.000
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

04:45.584 --> 04:52.584
to create the universal

04:53.542 --> 04:58.542
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

04:58.584 --> 05:05.584
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

05:07.459 --> 05:14.459
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

05:16.000 --> 05:19.000
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

05:20.000 --> 05:24.626
and the Mahalakshmi has got

05:25.000 --> 05:28.000
for the redemption, for the awakening.

05:28.584 --> 05:33.250
But the Adi Shakti’s work

05:33.250 --> 05:36.250
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

05:38.542 --> 05:41.709
and to integrate all those qualities,

05:42.000 --> 05:47.000
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

05:47.000 --> 05:51.626
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

05:52.209 --> 05:55.209
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
But as it is,

05:59.042 --> 06:01.250
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

06:01.250 --> 06:04.250
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

06:04.292 --> 06:07.292
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.334
And this is the…

06:10.375 --> 06:12.584
where She created the Devaloka.

06:13.626 --> 06:18.000
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

06:18.417 --> 06:21.000
Like She created Indra –

06:21.250 --> 06:24.375
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

06:24.375 --> 06:29.375
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

06:30.000 --> 06:33.000
Devaloka was created on this side,

06:34.417 --> 06:38.209
and ganas and all these people were created

06:38.209 --> 06:42.667
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

06:49.000 --> 06:53.000
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

06:53.334 --> 06:59.417
in such a condition when people were really,

06:59.459 --> 07:03.250
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

07:03.250 --> 07:05.250
they could not understand Him,

07:05.292 --> 07:08.292
they could not understand Socrates at all

07:08.292 --> 07:13.459
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

07:13.459 --> 07:17.459
by the people who were surrounding Him,

07:18.250 --> 07:22.250
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

07:22.250 --> 07:25.501
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

07:25.501 --> 07:30.000
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

07:30.209 --> 07:35.584
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

07:36.000 --> 07:39.000
and they started their own theories, own styles,

07:39.000 --> 07:42.000
and that’s how we find the accent from

07:42.000 --> 07:46.000
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

07:46.417 --> 07:51.334
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

07:51.334 --> 07:55.334
So the attention was moved from philosophy

07:55.375 --> 07:58.375
to economics today,

07:58.375 --> 08:03.626
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

08:03.667 --> 08:08.375
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

08:08.417 --> 08:16.250
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

08:16.292 --> 08:22.292
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

08:24.375 --> 08:28.334
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

08:28.375 --> 08:30.000
Abraham had different problems.

08:30.000 --> 08:35.083
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

08:35.083 --> 08:37.584
who were  really very, very ignorant,

08:38.000 --> 08:42.417
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

08:43.000 --> 08:47.209
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

08:47.250 --> 08:49.000
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

08:49.000 --> 08:51.709
and if you read Bible, in the –

08:52.000 --> 08:56.417
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

08:56.626 --> 09:04.417
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

09:04.501 --> 09:09.167
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

09:09.292 --> 09:13.292
to make the people follow religion precisely.

09:14.000 --> 09:17.626
So He did not argue, He did not say

09:18.042 --> 09:21.375
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

09:21.501 --> 09:24.501
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

09:24.542 --> 09:28.125
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

09:28.417 --> 09:34.667
that you understand this or

09:35.250 --> 09:37.626
that you see the point;

09:38.000 --> 09:39.417
He could not do that way.

09:40.000 --> 09:43.626
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

09:44.000 --> 09:47.209
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

09:47.209 --> 09:50.209
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

09:51.417 --> 09:54.417
Because the people were of that type.

09:55.250 --> 09:58.083
Now then you see how gradually,

09:58.125 --> 10:02.083
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

10:02.167 --> 10:04.167
they were a much better people

10:04.292 --> 10:08.292
so He could talk to them about something

10:10.250 --> 10:15.250
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

10:15.250 --> 10:17.250
Of so many things He talked,

10:17.250 --> 10:20.417
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

10:22.000 --> 10:25.000
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

10:25.000 --> 10:27.000
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

10:28.626 --> 10:32.626
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

10:33.584 --> 10:37.584
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

10:38.000 --> 10:42.375
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

10:43.000 --> 10:46.542
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

10:47.042 --> 10:51.667
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

10:52.042 --> 10:56.125
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

10:56.167 --> 10:58.626
and the relationships were building up,

10:59.000 --> 11:02.167
and He tried to work it on that level.

11:02.292 --> 11:07.292
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

11:08.209 --> 11:12.000
They evolved but still very ignorant.

11:12.250 --> 11:14.459
So they evolved to this point

11:14.542 --> 11:18.375
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

11:18.417 --> 11:23.584
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

11:24.000 --> 11:27.334
taking their freedom, getting out from there

11:27.334 --> 11:35.000
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

11:36.542 --> 11:38.542
But when they did that,

11:38.584 --> 11:41.584
He found these people on the way –

11:41.584 --> 11:45.334
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

11:45.375 --> 11:48.375
when He came back – what He finds…

12:12.167 --> 12:16.626
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

12:17.125 --> 12:22.334
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

12:23.000 --> 12:27.417
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

12:27.417 --> 12:30.417
extremely immoral character.

12:30.459 --> 12:36.000
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

12:36.000 --> 12:39.334
that nobody can believe that anybody

12:39.334 --> 12:42.167
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

12:42.209 --> 12:44.375
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

12:45.334 --> 12:50.626
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

12:51.209 --> 12:59.209
Now then came the time when people were…

13:01.292 --> 13:06.000
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

13:06.125 --> 13:08.125
we can say at the time of Christ,

13:09.000 --> 13:11.459
but they were not so immoral;

13:12.167 --> 13:14.626
they also could not understand Christ.

13:15.417 --> 13:20.417
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

13:20.417 --> 13:23.000
the human awareness evolving,

13:23.125 --> 13:29.209
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

13:29.667 --> 13:32.667
and you could not talk to them.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.417
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

13:39.000 --> 13:41.626
When the circumstances are such,

13:42.334 --> 13:46.000
like at the time of, say Moses,

13:46.542 --> 13:49.542
that people are extremely immoral,

13:49.542 --> 13:52.542
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

13:54.000 --> 13:58.459
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

14:00.125 --> 14:05.125
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

14:06.000 --> 14:09.000
because they were so left-sided:

14:09.250 --> 14:13.209
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

14:13.209 --> 14:17.000
and say that, “If you do like this,

14:17.000 --> 14:20.000
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

14:20.375 --> 14:22.375
So they took to violence.

14:24.000 --> 14:30.000
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

14:31.042 --> 14:35.042
also the awareness of human beings.

14:35.167 --> 14:38.167
So many things worked it out.

14:39.125 --> 14:43.125
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

14:43.459 --> 14:52.167
her job was to create a integrated force

14:55.501 --> 15:03.250
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

15:03.584 --> 15:11.584
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

15:13.042 --> 15:20.042
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

15:24.292 --> 15:27.292
You have to integrate people

15:29.125 --> 15:32.125
which are left-sided and right-sided.

15:34.292 --> 15:38.000
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

15:38.042 --> 15:41.000
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

15:41.000 --> 15:44.125
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

15:46.000 --> 15:53.000
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

15:54.042 --> 16:00.292
and despite that they resisted him

16:00.292 --> 16:03.292
because they were given this special capacity.

16:04.501 --> 16:07.501
Something with Greeks, they went to…

16:07.501 --> 16:10.501
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

16:11.375 --> 16:16.334
who tried to invade India,

16:17.167 --> 16:20.209
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

16:21.375 --> 16:23.667
You see it’s a Greek nature

16:24.125 --> 16:27.375
that they can go so far and then not,

16:28.375 --> 16:31.375
because they have an integrating force.

16:31.667 --> 16:35.626
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

16:36.417 --> 16:41.167
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

16:42.000 --> 16:45.459
So this power of receding back

16:46.292 --> 16:50.000
is the integrating power,

16:51.000 --> 16:53.125
by you integrate within yourself

16:53.125 --> 16:58.125
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

16:58.167 --> 17:00.501
and you see now that’s alright.

17:01.501 --> 17:03.501
If you have to be in the centre

17:03.542 --> 17:06.542
we should go up to a point and come back.

17:07.459 --> 17:12.417
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.000
If you take their shipping,

17:15.167 --> 17:18.501
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

17:18.584 --> 17:20.709
extremely aggressive people,

17:21.000 --> 17:24.709
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

17:25.000 --> 17:27.000
They were not very law-abiding

17:27.000 --> 17:29.584
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

17:29.626 --> 17:34.459
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

17:34.501 --> 17:40.125
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

17:40.125 --> 17:45.167
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

17:46.501 --> 17:50.501
So perhaps, perhaps,

17:51.000 --> 17:54.501
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

17:54.709 --> 17:57.709
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

17:58.501 --> 18:02.083
Then when the shipping went down –

18:02.125 --> 18:05.584
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

18:06.000 --> 18:08.000
they sunk their ships

18:09.501 --> 18:13.501
and got the money out of insurance.

18:19.000 --> 18:24.000
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

18:24.083 --> 18:29.250
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

18:29.542 --> 18:32.042
they know that how far to go.

18:32.209 --> 18:35.667
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

18:36.292 --> 18:39.125
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

18:39.125 --> 18:43.167
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

18:43.167 --> 18:46.626
Alright. He married her up to a point,

18:47.000 --> 18:50.083
but most of his property went to his daughter,

18:50.083 --> 18:52.083
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

18:53.334 --> 18:59.584
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

18:59.584 --> 19:03.292
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

19:03.334 --> 19:05.209
like Americans are.

19:05.250 --> 19:08.417
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

19:08.542 --> 19:10.542
but Greeks can never become idiots,

19:10.584 --> 19:12.584
whatever you may try.

19:14.000 --> 19:16.626
They are very sharp and very intelligent

19:17.501 --> 19:20.501
but they know how far to go with everything.

19:21.542 --> 19:24.542
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

19:25.584 --> 19:29.459
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

19:29.459 --> 19:32.459
and She created Ganesha here.

19:33.292 --> 19:36.584
And the balance of the universe,

19:36.584 --> 19:40.417
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

19:40.459 --> 19:45.042
and so the people over here are very balanced.

19:46.334 --> 19:51.209
You can find them very…

19:51.334 --> 19:56.209
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

19:56.501 --> 19:59.501
One may say because they are traditional people,

19:59.542 --> 20:01.542
they have long traditions.

20:02.000 --> 20:05.000
But Egypt had also long traditions.

20:05.626 --> 20:08.501
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

20:08.542 --> 20:12.417
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

20:12.667 --> 20:17.667
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

20:19.250 --> 20:22.250
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

20:23.000 --> 20:29.000
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

20:30.000 --> 20:32.334
but they are not like Indians.

20:34.292 --> 20:38.292
So what is lacking in all these people is

20:39.292 --> 20:43.292
the depth of awareness

20:44.209 --> 20:50.375
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

20:50.667 --> 20:57.626
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

20:58.626 --> 21:04.375
and China rose also, afterwards,

21:04.501 --> 21:07.501
into her own glory

21:08.042 --> 21:13.542
and became quite a good industrial,

21:14.000 --> 21:17.417
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

21:18.667 --> 21:24.292
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

21:24.292 --> 21:27.042
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

21:27.542 --> 21:29.334
Do you know last…

21:29.334 --> 21:32.292
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

21:32.292 --> 21:36.250
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

21:36.292 --> 21:39.083
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

21:39.083 --> 21:46.083
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

21:47.000 --> 21:49.542
and you see what’s happening in China.

21:51.417 --> 21:54.417
So the effects of these

21:59.000 --> 22:03.584
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

22:04.292 --> 22:08.292
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

22:09.209 --> 22:11.167
Now you may say that,

22:11.209 --> 22:15.209
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

22:16.501 --> 22:22.042
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

22:22.292 --> 22:25.459
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

22:25.584 --> 22:29.209
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

22:29.250 --> 22:32.375
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

22:32.375 --> 22:37.334
so I thought that let Greeks

22:38.459 --> 22:42.167
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

22:43.250 --> 22:46.626
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

22:47.000 --> 22:53.042
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

22:54.417 --> 23:00.209
because actually, at the time

23:00.250 --> 23:02.417
when Athena came here,

23:02.459 --> 23:06.584
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

23:07.334 --> 23:12.584
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

23:13.042 --> 23:15.626
So now to bring Himalaya here,

23:16.125 --> 23:21.000
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

23:22.292 --> 23:24.626
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

23:25.292 --> 23:28.584
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

23:29.083 --> 23:36.000
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

23:36.000 --> 23:38.209
most unorthodox,

23:39.334 --> 23:42.667
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

23:45.292 --> 23:50.000
So we have a problem, big problem,

23:50.584 --> 23:53.584
how we’ll establish here.

23:56.000 --> 24:00.250
The Devaloka was formed here

24:00.417 --> 24:04.417
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

24:05.000 --> 24:09.417
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

24:10.417 --> 24:15.417
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

24:15.417 --> 24:22.501
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

24:23.000 --> 24:30.167
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

24:31.334 --> 24:37.334
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

24:40.000 --> 24:43.250
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

24:43.501 --> 24:46.501
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

24:46.542 --> 24:50.542
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

24:51.542 --> 24:55.083
And that is responsible for the downfall

24:55.125 --> 24:59.167
because this part of the country

25:01.334 --> 25:06.334
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

25:07.584 --> 25:14.501
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

25:15.167 --> 25:21.209
we see it has become just the opposite

25:22.250 --> 25:29.375
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

25:29.417 --> 25:32.375
to such degrading things.

25:33.125 --> 25:39.459
Even in the mythology also, in India

25:40.042 --> 25:45.542
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

25:46.459 --> 25:52.209
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

25:53.000 --> 26:01.125
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

26:02.417 --> 26:09.375
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

26:09.501 --> 26:15.042
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

26:15.042 --> 26:20.334
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

26:20.459 --> 26:25.501
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

26:26.000 --> 26:30.459
and from here Indra went down

26:31.501 --> 26:34.501
and took away the wife.

26:35.501 --> 26:39.501
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

26:40.542 --> 26:43.459
and Indra went down,

26:43.501 --> 26:47.501
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

26:47.501 --> 26:51.501
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

26:53.000 --> 26:56.417
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

26:57.584 --> 27:01.125
So now the… see how the combinations are,

27:01.167 --> 27:08.501
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

27:08.501 --> 27:11.501
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

27:12.542 --> 27:16.042
it was in his ashram He stayed.

27:17.501 --> 27:20.709
So the Muni Shandilya told

27:21.459 --> 27:25.000
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

27:25.000 --> 27:30.501
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

27:31.042 --> 27:38.042
who will, by his own devotion,

27:38.501 --> 27:42.501
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

27:43.125 --> 27:49.626
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

27:51.083 --> 27:53.584
and He will kill this asura.

27:54.083 --> 27:59.083
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

27:59.083 --> 28:03.083
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

28:04.542 --> 28:06.626
So this Narasimha came

28:06.667 --> 28:12.501
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

28:13.375 --> 28:16.375
little boy played there around and he made some

28:16.459 --> 28:21.459
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

28:21.667 --> 28:26.584
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

28:27.000 --> 28:29.042
That was made by Prahlad,

28:29.167 --> 28:32.542
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

28:32.709 --> 28:36.042
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

28:36.250 --> 28:40.000
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

28:40.334 --> 28:43.209
So see the relationship, how it is.

28:43.542 --> 28:48.459
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

28:49.083 --> 28:56.501
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

28:57.209 --> 29:04.167
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

29:04.584 --> 29:10.626
that not any animal can kill him,

29:10.626 --> 29:13.334
not any human being can kill him,

29:13.334 --> 29:17.334
not on the land or in the sky,

29:18.083 --> 29:21.000
and not with any weapon –

29:21.000 --> 29:24.000
all so many blessings he had taken!

29:24.000 --> 29:26.709
He had closed all the lines, you see,

29:27.000 --> 29:29.083
so that nobody should kill him,

29:30.000 --> 29:35.542
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

29:36.626 --> 29:40.667
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

29:40.667 --> 29:44.667
is that He became the simha,

29:45.167 --> 29:50.250
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

29:51.417 --> 29:56.667
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

29:57.083 --> 30:00.209
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

30:00.209 --> 30:04.209
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

30:05.000 --> 30:07.334
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

30:07.542 --> 30:11.125
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

30:11.250 --> 30:14.417
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

30:14.417 --> 30:16.417
pillar of stone,

30:16.584 --> 30:20.584
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

30:21.000 --> 30:26.459
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

30:27.125 --> 30:29.459
with long hands and claws,

30:29.584 --> 30:32.250
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

30:32.417 --> 30:37.667
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

30:38.250 --> 30:43.000
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

30:43.250 --> 30:45.375
He opened his stomach and killed him.

30:47.501 --> 30:50.501
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

30:50.501 --> 30:55.167
the people of Egypt made their…

30:55.209 --> 30:58.584
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

30:59.584 --> 31:02.584
they were the ones who were asuras,

31:03.250 --> 31:05.250
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

31:06.000 --> 31:12.000
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

31:12.417 --> 31:15.667
the other way round than Narasimha.

31:18.375 --> 31:23.626
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

31:23.667 --> 31:30.667
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

31:32.250 --> 31:35.292
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

31:37.542 --> 31:43.417
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

31:43.459 --> 31:46.459
because all these devas were Greeks –

31:47.209 --> 31:50.167
and these devas were, like Indra,

31:50.167 --> 31:53.167
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

31:54.417 --> 31:57.334
But I think there… because

31:57.375 --> 32:01.209
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

32:01.626 --> 32:07.626
they could not see the proper image of their...

32:09.209 --> 32:14.626
of their...faces in their meditation

32:15.167 --> 32:17.042
because they perverted them

32:17.042 --> 32:20.042
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

32:20.042 --> 32:24.209
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

32:24.209 --> 32:27.000
which was all their own imagination

32:27.000 --> 32:31.125
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

32:31.167 --> 32:37.209
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

32:38.042 --> 32:44.584
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

32:45.042 --> 32:47.250
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

32:47.292 --> 32:50.584
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

32:50.626 --> 32:55.667
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

32:55.667 --> 32:59.667
So they made them more like…

33:01.083 --> 33:04.375
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

33:04.417 --> 33:07.292
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

33:07.292 --> 33:10.501
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

33:10.542 --> 33:13.000
like Varuna, I can tell you.

33:13.000 --> 33:16.167
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

33:16.167 --> 33:18.667
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

33:18.667 --> 33:24.167
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

33:25.000 --> 33:27.209
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

33:27.209 --> 33:30.334
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

33:31.250 --> 33:36.209
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

33:40.000 --> 33:43.042
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

33:43.042 --> 33:45.626
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

33:46.000 --> 33:47.334
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

33:47.334 --> 33:51.125
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

33:53.000 --> 33:55.250
So with such expense they gave it

33:55.292 --> 33:59.125
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

34:00.209 --> 34:03.125
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

34:03.125 --> 34:09.709
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

34:10.334 --> 34:18.209
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

34:18.459 --> 34:22.709
On that history stands the modern Greek.

34:24.042 --> 34:29.501
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

34:30.000 --> 34:32.375
people had evolved we think,

34:33.000 --> 34:36.000
but they also crucified Christ,

34:37.083 --> 34:39.083
so what was their evolution?

34:39.250 --> 34:46.125
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

34:46.459 --> 34:51.459
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

34:53.000 --> 34:54.584
there is much difference

34:55.375 --> 35:00.375
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

35:01.292 --> 35:05.209
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

35:05.209 --> 35:08.334
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

35:08.459 --> 35:12.417
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

35:12.584 --> 35:16.000
But still He was also killed;

35:16.459 --> 35:20.375
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

35:20.626 --> 35:25.042
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

35:25.250 --> 35:29.250
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

35:30.209 --> 35:35.501
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

35:36.083 --> 35:39.626
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

35:40.083 --> 35:46.083
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

35:46.167 --> 35:50.501
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

35:51.000 --> 35:52.125
500 before Christ;

35:52.417 --> 35:58.334
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

35:58.459 --> 36:02.167
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

36:02.501 --> 36:05.459
as because He was Primordial Master.

36:06.334 --> 36:10.334
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

36:12.083 --> 36:15.501
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

36:16.000 --> 36:20.709
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

36:21.584 --> 36:25.501
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

36:25.501 --> 36:29.459
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

36:30.125 --> 36:34.375
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

36:34.375 --> 36:38.375
they would not accept any person,

36:38.375 --> 36:41.292
they would throw away, they would beat people.

36:41.334 --> 36:45.459
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

36:45.501 --> 36:48.209
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

36:48.209 --> 36:50.125
like very harsh people.

36:51.000 --> 36:54.667
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

36:54.667 --> 36:58.000
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

36:58.000 --> 37:01.292
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

37:01.542 --> 37:03.584
See, He saw the point

37:04.250 --> 37:07.626
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

37:08.167 --> 37:10.042
talking in that way.

37:10.042 --> 37:13.209
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

37:13.209 --> 37:15.542
even reason it out like Socrates did,

37:16.000 --> 37:19.334
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

37:19.501 --> 37:22.459
the whole logic system comes from Him,

37:23.292 --> 37:25.292
He’s a master of logic.

37:25.292 --> 37:31.000
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

37:31.501 --> 37:35.167
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

37:35.292 --> 37:39.667
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

37:40.292 --> 37:44.000
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

37:44.167 --> 37:47.417
And Christ understood that there is no logic

37:47.626 --> 37:50.626
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

37:51.334 --> 37:54.042
So He talked to them in parables,

37:55.000 --> 37:56.667
but still they killed Him.

37:57.626 --> 38:02.459
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

38:02.459 --> 38:06.667
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

38:07.292 --> 38:10.292
were very funny, and they did it.

38:12.250 --> 38:17.584
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

38:18.167 --> 38:21.542
I should give Realisation to people first,

38:23.334 --> 38:26.709
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

38:27.167 --> 38:30.000
Now, I’m talking to you everything

38:30.042 --> 38:33.083
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

38:33.083 --> 38:36.083
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

38:36.459 --> 38:41.167
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

38:41.501 --> 38:43.375
and one who are not.

38:43.375 --> 38:47.459
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

38:47.542 --> 38:52.000
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

38:52.125 --> 38:58.334
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

38:58.334 --> 39:02.334
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

39:02.334 --> 39:06.334
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

39:06.375 --> 39:10.000
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

39:10.000 --> 39:14.542
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

39:15.000 --> 39:19.417
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

39:19.459 --> 39:22.501
where collectively you are understanding Me.

39:22.501 --> 39:25.584
The situation is not so bad as that was

39:25.709 --> 39:28.417
even at the time of Christ.

39:28.417 --> 39:30.542
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

39:30.542 --> 39:33.542
He was the only wise man going around.

39:34.000 --> 39:36.501
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

39:36.501 --> 39:39.542
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

39:39.542 --> 39:43.501
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

39:44.083 --> 39:47.209
Both of them, really,

39:47.542 --> 39:51.125
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

39:51.125 --> 39:53.292
which were all absolutely.

39:53.375 --> 39:56.292
But He talked absolutely…

39:56.334 --> 40:00.501
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

40:00.626 --> 40:02.626
and talked so openly.

40:03.209 --> 40:06.417
Then, in the same way, we can say,

40:06.626 --> 40:09.584
the Primordial Master state is that

40:10.042 --> 40:13.417
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

40:14.501 --> 40:18.459
He was also killed because He told the truth.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.584
Then came Nanaka;

40:23.000 --> 40:26.000
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

40:26.417 --> 40:30.292
and the people who really follow Him are just

40:31.501 --> 40:33.417
in the opposite direction.

40:33.417 --> 40:36.000
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

40:36.000 --> 40:39.167
so they are going in that way.

40:39.209 --> 40:43.125
You find even same thing with Christ;

40:43.125 --> 40:47.459
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

40:48.167 --> 40:51.125
Every religion is just the same.

40:51.125 --> 40:54.000
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

40:54.125 --> 40:57.542
Those who preach Gita are just…

40:58.000 --> 41:00.209
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

41:00.250 --> 41:03.083
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

41:03.083 --> 41:05.542
going down, taking people down.

41:05.542 --> 41:08.542
So it is common with all religions

41:09.501 --> 41:14.292
that they have always used the name of prophets

41:15.125 --> 41:21.501
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

41:21.501 --> 41:28.501
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

41:29.501 --> 41:32.000
So, now those who are alert about it,

41:32.000 --> 41:36.042
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

41:37.667 --> 41:39.667
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

41:40.042 --> 41:43.667
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

41:44.250 --> 41:48.250
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

41:49.334 --> 41:52.209
instead of going themselves down.

41:52.250 --> 41:58.083
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

41:58.250 --> 42:02.083
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

42:02.083 --> 42:04.709
If Athena could be awakened here,

42:05.042 --> 42:09.000
this place could be of very great help to us.

42:09.584 --> 42:15.209
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

42:15.209 --> 42:20.000
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

42:20.000 --> 42:25.584
also they have lots of qualities of

42:25.584 --> 42:32.125
understanding the worthlessness of

42:32.417 --> 42:39.083
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

42:39.250 --> 42:41.459
But the immorality grew,

42:41.459 --> 42:45.083
now, because they started copying Westerners;

42:45.250 --> 42:48.501
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

42:49.042 --> 42:53.167
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

42:53.501 --> 42:57.042
Before that the women were very moral,

42:57.042 --> 42:59.501
very good women lived here,

43:00.000 --> 43:04.417
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

43:05.000 --> 43:09.000
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

43:09.042 --> 43:11.375
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

43:11.375 --> 43:14.000
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

43:14.000 --> 43:17.000
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

43:17.000 --> 43:20.626
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

43:21.042 --> 43:25.042
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

43:25.501 --> 43:28.417
They may use a woman who has no character

43:28.417 --> 43:30.626
but they respect the woman who has character

43:30.626 --> 43:33.000
and also respect the mother.

43:33.125 --> 43:36.417
So there are lots of qualities in this country

43:36.459 --> 43:40.083
which are still existing,

43:40.250 --> 43:44.626
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

43:45.042 --> 43:49.042
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

43:49.167 --> 43:55.334
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

43:55.375 --> 43:58.667
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

43:59.209 --> 44:01.250
May God bless you!

44:18.292 --> 44:21.375
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

44:21.375 --> 44:24.292
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

44:37.250 --> 44:41.250
He was very much respected in India, always,

44:42.083 --> 44:45.083
Alexander was very much respected in India,

44:45.334 --> 44:48.334
and because he went away

44:49.042 --> 44:52.042
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

44:53.250 --> 44:57.501
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

44:58.542 --> 45:00.709
I think he got quite detached

45:01.167 --> 45:04.375
after coming to India. Anybody who has

45:04.375 --> 45:08.542
come to invade India, and has really gained something

45:08.542 --> 45:11.667
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

45:12.000 --> 45:15.000
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

45:15.000 --> 45:16.167
three hundred years.

45:16.167 --> 45:19.125
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

45:20.000 --> 45:23.000
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

45:23.375 --> 45:27.042
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

45:27.250 --> 45:29.250
nothing went into their heads.

45:31.167 --> 45:34.709
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

45:35.083 --> 45:37.626
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

45:37.626 --> 45:41.626
So many are there even now living in the forests.

45:43.042 --> 45:47.501
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

45:47.501 --> 45:51.000
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

45:51.209 --> 45:54.417
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

45:54.417 --> 45:58.125
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

45:58.417 --> 46:02.000
who was at the time of Alexander.

46:02.209 --> 46:06.709
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

46:07.083 --> 46:10.209
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

46:10.334 --> 46:13.375
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

46:14.042 --> 46:18.626
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

46:19.000 --> 46:20.167
to England;

46:22.250 --> 46:24.167
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

46:24.167 --> 46:27.167
and the sign of awareness is this, that

46:27.167 --> 46:30.501
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

46:31.334 --> 46:35.334
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

46:36.042 --> 46:40.125
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

46:40.292 --> 46:43.459
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

46:43.459 --> 46:47.250
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

46:47.292 --> 46:49.000
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

46:49.083 --> 46:51.042
so he went back and told his king that,

46:51.042 --> 46:54.167
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

46:54.167 --> 46:56.083
They are not Muslims”.

46:58.459 --> 47:00.042
So simple he was.

47:00.042 --> 47:03.250
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

47:03.250 --> 47:06.167
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

47:06.667 --> 47:08.042
He was a nice man.

47:08.042 --> 47:11.167
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

47:11.167 --> 47:13.584
but still certain respect they showed, like

47:14.000 --> 47:16.375
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

47:17.250 --> 47:19.083
They still call it Mumbai.

47:19.375 --> 47:21.125
many words Mumbai

47:21.250 --> 47:25.375
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

47:25.501 --> 47:28.167
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

47:28.292 --> 47:29.667
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

47:30.125 --> 47:32.125
so they call it Mumbai –

47:32.375 --> 47:34.375
is the name of the Goddess.

47:34.584 --> 47:36.584
So they didn’t want to change it.

47:37.083 --> 47:40.125
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

47:40.292 --> 47:42.250
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

47:42.292 --> 47:44.501
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

47:44.584 --> 47:46.083
I said, “It is.”

47:46.375 --> 47:50.000
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

47:53.375 --> 47:56.501
So you see the… see the awareness,

47:56.501 --> 47:59.167
you can see the awareness of people

47:59.334 --> 48:04.542
because they were so aware about the serenity,

48:04.584 --> 48:08.167
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

48:08.292 --> 48:10.042
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

48:10.042 --> 48:12.584
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

48:13.375 --> 48:16.626
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

48:17.042 --> 48:19.292
But the English could have gone and found out

48:19.292 --> 48:23.167
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

48:23.250 --> 48:24.459
But they did not.

48:24.459 --> 48:27.459
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

48:27.501 --> 48:30.167
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

48:30.667 --> 48:33.667
because, you see, that respect

48:34.209 --> 48:36.542
for serenity and all these things,

48:37.000 --> 48:41.334
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

48:41.417 --> 48:45.292
Now the children of Britain

48:45.501 --> 48:49.042
are better, are very different, very different.

48:49.292 --> 48:52.667
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

48:54.083 --> 49:00.209
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

49:01.209 --> 49:05.209
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

49:06.000 --> 49:07.375
they came with respect.

49:08.584 --> 49:14.542
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

49:15.501 --> 49:17.501
And now, as the time has passed,

49:17.501 --> 49:20.083
I find Britishers have respect for others,

49:20.459 --> 49:23.667
they’re respecting, many.

49:23.667 --> 49:27.125
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

49:27.125 --> 49:31.083
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

49:36.375 --> 49:40.375
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

49:40.709 --> 49:43.209
That is the part lacking in England.

49:43.334 --> 49:46.667
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

49:47.042 --> 49:49.375
then what sort of a heart it must be?

49:50.209 --> 49:53.209
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

49:56.417 --> 50:03.584
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

50:04.125 --> 50:10.167
respecting others, respecting their culture,

50:10.167 --> 50:14.292
respecting their lifestyle.

50:14.542 --> 50:20.042
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

50:20.375 --> 50:24.000
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

50:24.375 --> 50:27.209
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

50:27.375 --> 50:30.584
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

50:31.083 --> 50:33.626
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

50:33.626 --> 50:36.626
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

50:37.292 --> 50:42.125
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

50:42.292 --> 50:45.709
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

50:46.042 --> 50:49.125
So that is there but just theory.

50:49.292 --> 50:53.042
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

50:53.209 --> 50:58.626
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

50:59.000 --> 51:02.000
and fasting for South Africa.

51:03.417 --> 51:05.709
So between the South African awareness

51:06.083 --> 51:09.417
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

51:09.542 --> 51:13.542
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

51:14.501 --> 51:19.334
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

51:19.459 --> 51:22.459
I think it can transform the whole world.

51:23.042 --> 51:26.501
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

51:27.375 --> 51:29.417
It has to be respect.

51:34.250 --> 51:36.375
It is not insulting now,

51:36.584 --> 51:40.042
but it is not positive respect.

51:40.209 --> 51:44.125
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

51:44.125 --> 51:47.709
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

51:47.709 --> 51:50.626
This is what I have been talking about,

51:51.042 --> 51:54.417
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

51:55.250 --> 51:59.375
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

51:59.709 --> 52:02.125
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

52:02.125 --> 52:05.125
because still they have a sense of respect.

52:08.083 --> 52:12.083
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

52:13.292 --> 52:17.459
That part is there, that one has to learn.

52:17.459 --> 52:21.459
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

52:22.542 --> 52:28.542
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

52:29.167 --> 52:32.375
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

52:32.375 --> 52:36.334
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

52:41.334 --> 52:43.709
And respect is something from your heart.

52:44.292 --> 52:48.125
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

52:48.250 --> 52:50.542
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

52:51.501 --> 52:55.292
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

52:55.292 --> 52:58.459
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

52:58.459 --> 53:01.709
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

53:04.292 --> 53:08.542
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

53:09.375 --> 53:12.417
and when that works out then

53:12.417 --> 53:16.125
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

53:16.334 --> 53:21.250
high state of understanding of Divinity.

53:21.501 --> 53:26.501
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

53:27.125 --> 53:31.125
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

53:31.501 --> 53:34.667
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

53:34.667 --> 53:38.667
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

53:39.334 --> 53:41.584
And that it’s not what you get,

53:42.000 --> 53:44.167
it’s not what you have,

53:44.292 --> 53:49.292
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

53:52.375 --> 53:56.417
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

53:56.501 --> 53:58.626
because there’s a big understanding

53:58.626 --> 54:00.709
now between you and the Divine,

54:01.042 --> 54:03.501
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

54:03.584 --> 54:07.584
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

54:08.667 --> 54:13.042
learn that respect, then things will work out.

54:13.083 --> 54:15.209
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

54:15.250 --> 54:18.709
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

54:19.000 --> 54:20.459
May God bless you!
