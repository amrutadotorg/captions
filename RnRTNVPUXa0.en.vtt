00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Everything in Sahaja Yoga is very scientific,

00:00:06.626 --> 00:00:10.626
is all pre-planned I think, and is all significant.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:16.584
For example, today is Wednesday

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and we have never had any Puja on a Wednesday

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.542
because I was born on Wednesday.

00:00:24.375 --> 00:00:28.375
So I was thinking if the Puja starts before twelve o’clock

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:30.459
we’ll be able to manage it

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:32.501
because I was born at twelve.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
So every child has to sleep after twelve o’clock, you see,

00:00:36.417 --> 00:00:41.417
and so I couldn’t, I had to sleep. So it’s so significant, you see.

00:00:41.459 --> 00:00:44.000
It’s the first time we are having a Puja on Wednesday,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.209
normally I don’t even travel on Wednesdays.

00:00:47.459 --> 00:00:53.167
So, you can imagine that it’s such a breakthrough and I’m very happy

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:55.417
that you all are ready for a Puja

00:00:55.459 --> 00:01:01.125
and that we could break this rule also,

00:01:01.167 --> 00:01:04.501
after such a long time,

00:01:04.501 --> 00:01:11.000
because it was impossible for me to keep awake after twelve, you see

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.584
I was trying, trying, trying

00:01:12.626 --> 00:01:16.042
and I knew that you all, also, were feeling very sleepy.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
So it’s so mutual and it’s so simple.Alright.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.417
So today we have gathered, really, remarkably,

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:40.334
in the really centre of the Nabhi of the universe,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and I don’t know how far

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I can go with the description of this great country

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:51.375
which we call as Greece.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.542
Also, in the Puranas it is described as Manipura Dweep.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.375
The Manipur is the Nabhi Chakra – Manipur,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.459
and a “dweep” is a island.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.417
Island of the Manipura stays the Athena,

00:02:15.584 --> 00:02:20.459
and there is a temple of Athena,

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.334
all been described about Her temple, about Her

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.250
jewelry, dress and everything.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:38.083
So it’s already in the Puranas described, this Athena.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.250
As I’ve told you before, ‘Athena’ means the Primordial Mother.

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.459
So now, one may say that,

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.709
“Why the Primordial Mother, Adi Shakti,

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
should be on the Nabhi Chakra of the universe?”

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:55.000
One may ask a question like that,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
that, “Why She’s placed on the Nabhi Chakra?”

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Because in the – I don’t know in English –

00:03:11.417 --> 00:03:16.417
before the Creation was created in the material form,

00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:20.375
where it was planned,

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.584
then there was something of the –

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000
what we call is the Vishnuloka,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:38.501
is the loka, or the area where Vishnu ruled,

00:03:40.042 --> 00:03:45.417
and in that Vishnuloka it was decided

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:55.083
that Adi Shakti should first come in the form as a cow,

00:03:55.667 --> 00:04:01.334
and then She should descend in the area called as Gokul,

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.375
which is Vishuddhi Chakra,  first

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:06.667
and create vibrations there.

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:11.667
Now in the material form the Gokul was

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:15.292
where Shri Krishna lived in His childhood.

00:04:17.334 --> 00:04:24.209
So in the material form, Athena itself lived –

00:04:25.167 --> 00:04:31.042
in the material form, I’m not saying in the formation before –

00:04:31.292 --> 00:04:35.709
in this area, to create the vibrations.

00:04:36.167 --> 00:04:38.626
So it is not only She was a Goddess

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:41.584
but She lived in this area

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000
to create the vibrations for the Nabhi,

00:04:45.584 --> 00:04:52.584
to create the universal

00:04:53.542 --> 00:04:58.542
compassion and love and all Her qualities.

00:04:58.584 --> 00:05:05.584
Now as you know, every aspect of the Goddess has different qualities

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:14.459
and as you can see that Mahakali has the aspect of comforting,

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
and Mahasaraswati is counselling,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.626
and the Mahalakshmi has got

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
for the redemption, for the awakening.

00:05:28.584 --> 00:05:33.250
But the Adi Shakti’s work

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:36.250
is to unite everything, to integrate everything;

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.709
and to integrate all those qualities,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
the Adi Shakti Herself was…

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:51.626
in material form, came on this earth, in this part,

00:05:52.209 --> 00:05:55.209
and that’s why they knew about Athena.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000
But as it is,

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:01.250
I don’t know what are the stories they have–

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.250
they must be having some mythological stories about Athena

00:06:04.292 --> 00:06:07.292
that She lived like this or whatever it was.

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:10.334
And this is the…

00:06:10.375 --> 00:06:12.584
where She created the Devaloka.

00:06:13.626 --> 00:06:18.000
Devaloka is the area where devas existed.

00:06:18.417 --> 00:06:21.000
Like She created Indra –

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:24.375
you have heard the name of Indra – then Varuna;

00:06:24.375 --> 00:06:29.375
all these devalokas She created in this area, not in India.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000
Devaloka was created on this side,

00:06:34.417 --> 00:06:38.209
and ganas and all these people were created

00:06:38.209 --> 00:06:42.667
on the side of Nepal and all those places, on the left-hand side.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Now unfortunately after Socrates, who came here

00:06:53.334 --> 00:06:59.417
in such a condition when people were really,

00:06:59.459 --> 00:07:03.250
absolutely ignorant, in the complete darkness of ignorance,

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:05.250
they could not understand Him,

00:07:05.292 --> 00:07:08.292
they could not understand Socrates at all

00:07:08.292 --> 00:07:13.459
and so like any other Primordial Master was treated

00:07:13.459 --> 00:07:17.459
by the people who were surrounding Him,

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:22.250
He was also very much ill-treated and nobody listened to Him.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.501
But of course, as you know, He was Primordial Master

00:07:25.501 --> 00:07:30.000
and His wisdom is well-known and He created out of Him

00:07:30.209 --> 00:07:35.584
disciples, but none of them could go anywhere near His wisdom,

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000
and they started their own theories, own styles,

00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000
and that’s how we find the accent from

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000
philosophy that was Socrates’ aim,

00:07:46.417 --> 00:07:51.334
gradually came into political and then into economic side.

00:07:51.334 --> 00:07:55.334
So the attention was moved from philosophy

00:07:55.375 --> 00:07:58.375
to economics today,

00:07:58.375 --> 00:08:03.626
not towards the philosophy which was established by Socrates.

00:08:03.667 --> 00:08:08.375
We can say Socrates was the one Primordial Master,

00:08:08.417 --> 00:08:16.250
after Abraham and Moses, who really made it

00:08:16.292 --> 00:08:22.292
very clear-cut understanding about spirituality.

00:08:24.375 --> 00:08:28.334
Of course Moses and Mohammad…

00:08:28.375 --> 00:08:30.000
Abraham had different problems.

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.083
Like Abraham had problems of talking to people

00:08:35.083 --> 00:08:37.584
who were  really very, very ignorant,

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.417
and Moses had problem with people who were very indulgent people,

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.209
so He had to pass laws of Shariat.

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.000
Moses passed the law of Shariat,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:51.709
and if you read Bible, in the –

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.417
I think – in the first verse only it is written about Shariat

00:08:56.626 --> 00:09:04.417
in the Jeremiah (Leviticus?), third book of Bible,

00:09:04.501 --> 00:09:09.167
that Moses had to pass these laws, different, different laws

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:13.292
to make the people follow religion precisely.

00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.626
So He did not argue, He did not say

00:09:18.042 --> 00:09:21.375
why you should do it, didn’t give any explanation. “You do it!” Like that.

00:09:21.501 --> 00:09:24.501
Because He thought that these people are so ignorant

00:09:24.542 --> 00:09:28.125
that you cannot leave it to their freedom

00:09:28.417 --> 00:09:34.667
that you understand this or

00:09:35.250 --> 00:09:37.626
that you see the point;

00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.417
He could not do that way.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.626
So He just said, “Alright. These are the laws, these are the things

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:47.209
and you have to follow. If you don’t follow then you will be killed,

00:09:47.209 --> 00:09:50.209
your hands will be cut, this will happen, that will happen.”

00:09:51.417 --> 00:09:54.417
Because the people were of that type.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:58.083
Now then you see how gradually,

00:09:58.125 --> 00:10:02.083
at the time of Socrates people had evolved,

00:10:02.167 --> 00:10:04.167
they were a much better people

00:10:04.292 --> 00:10:08.292
so He could talk to them about something

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.250
of wisdom, of honesty, of righteousness, of peace.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:17.250
Of so many things He talked,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.417
and He could talk because people were worthy of that.

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.000
Otherwise He could have said, “Alright.

00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000
You do this, you do that, you do that.”

00:10:28.626 --> 00:10:32.626
But see the difference also in the circumstances how what has happened:

00:10:33.584 --> 00:10:37.584
in the first circumstances when Abraham had problems

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.375
then the people were absolutely good-for-nothing,

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.542
absolutely good for nothing, so He didn’t know what to do with them.

00:10:47.042 --> 00:10:51.667
So only, you can see it, in the time of Abraham that His own lifestyle…

00:10:52.042 --> 00:10:56.125
I mean, that was just a system when the family was building up

00:10:56.167 --> 00:10:58.626
and the relationships were building up,

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.167
and He tried to work it on that level.

00:11:02.292 --> 00:11:07.292
Then at the time of Moses people evolved much more.

00:11:08.209 --> 00:11:12.000
They evolved but still very ignorant.

00:11:12.250 --> 00:11:14.459
So they evolved to this point

00:11:14.542 --> 00:11:18.375
that He did not have to talk the things that Abraham talked.

00:11:18.417 --> 00:11:23.584
So He talked to them about getting out of Egypt,

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.334
taking their freedom, getting out from there

00:11:27.334 --> 00:11:35.000
and going to a place of more tranquillity.

00:11:36.542 --> 00:11:38.542
But when they did that,

00:11:38.584 --> 00:11:41.584
He found these people on the way –

00:11:41.584 --> 00:11:45.334
when He went to get the Ten Commandments,

00:11:45.375 --> 00:11:48.375
when He came back – what He finds…

00:12:12.167 --> 00:12:16.626
So the people who were at the time of Moses,

00:12:17.125 --> 00:12:22.334
when He had gone to get the Ten Commandments,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.417
started indulging into very, very immoral character,

00:12:27.417 --> 00:12:30.417
extremely immoral character.

00:12:30.459 --> 00:12:36.000
They were very immoral and were doing such horrible things that

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.334
that nobody can believe that anybody

00:12:39.334 --> 00:12:42.167
who tried to escape from the Egyptians

00:12:42.209 --> 00:12:44.375
were worse than the Egyptians themselves.

00:12:45.334 --> 00:12:50.626
So He gave this Shariat to them, to change.

00:12:51.209 --> 00:12:59.209
Now then came the time when people were…

00:13:01.292 --> 00:13:06.000
I mean, despite all that people were not so good,

00:13:06.125 --> 00:13:08.125
we can say at the time of Christ,

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:11.459
but they were not so immoral;

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:14.626
they also could not understand Christ.

00:13:15.417 --> 00:13:20.417
So you see, despite all the human evolution,

00:13:20.417 --> 00:13:23.000
the human awareness evolving,

00:13:23.125 --> 00:13:29.209
the understanding about spirituality was very poor

00:13:29.667 --> 00:13:32.667
and you could not talk to them.

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.417
Now you can also see the circumstances of things.

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.626
When the circumstances are such,

00:13:42.334 --> 00:13:46.000
like at the time of, say Moses,

00:13:46.542 --> 00:13:49.542
that people are extremely immoral,

00:13:49.542 --> 00:13:52.542
they are doing all kinds of bad things,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.459
they are not bothered about their own destruction,

00:14:00.125 --> 00:14:05.125
the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:09.000
because they were so left-sided:

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:13.209
So the Incarnations had to move absolutely to the right

00:14:13.209 --> 00:14:17.000
and say that, “If you do like this,

00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000
this We’ll have to do” the violence part.

00:14:20.375 --> 00:14:22.375
So they took to violence.

00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:30.000
So the circumstances made the reactions of the people,

00:14:31.042 --> 00:14:35.042
also the awareness of human beings.

00:14:35.167 --> 00:14:38.167
So many things worked it out.

00:14:39.125 --> 00:14:43.125
Say, for example, when Athena came on this earth,

00:14:43.459 --> 00:14:52.167
her job was to create a integrated force

00:14:55.501 --> 00:15:03.250
which will have the whole chaitanya spread like an integrated force.

00:15:03.584 --> 00:15:11.584
So that when it will be all disintegrated later on it can integrate.

00:15:13.042 --> 00:15:20.042
So the Greeks have a job, special job, is to integrate.

00:15:24.292 --> 00:15:27.292
You have to integrate people

00:15:29.125 --> 00:15:32.125
which are left-sided and right-sided.

00:15:34.292 --> 00:15:38.000
And that’s what I asked him, “What happened to Hitler?”

00:15:38.042 --> 00:15:41.000
So they said that when they saw Hitler,

00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.125
though Hitler respected them, they resisted Hitler.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:53.000
You can see the significance, how he respected the Greeks

00:15:54.042 --> 00:16:00.292
and despite that they resisted him

00:16:00.292 --> 00:16:03.292
because they were given this special capacity.

00:16:04.501 --> 00:16:07.501
Something with Greeks, they went to…

00:16:07.501 --> 00:16:10.501
I mean, except Alexander, only the one

00:16:11.375 --> 00:16:16.334
who tried to invade India,

00:16:17.167 --> 00:16:20.209
and because of the Greek nature he receded back.

00:16:21.375 --> 00:16:23.667
You see it’s a Greek nature

00:16:24.125 --> 00:16:27.375
that they can go so far and then not,

00:16:28.375 --> 00:16:31.375
because they have an integrating force.

00:16:31.667 --> 00:16:35.626
The same thing as I was asking him about what happened with the Turks.

00:16:36.417 --> 00:16:41.167
They had gone into Turkey but they receded back.

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.459
So this power of receding back

00:16:46.292 --> 00:16:50.000
is the integrating power,

00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:53.125
by you integrate within yourself

00:16:53.125 --> 00:16:58.125
both the qualities of the left and right and you balance it,

00:16:58.167 --> 00:17:00.501
and you see now that’s alright.

00:17:01.501 --> 00:17:03.501
If you have to be in the centre

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:06.542
we should go up to a point and come back.

00:17:07.459 --> 00:17:12.417
And this is a very basic quality of Greeks in every respect.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000
If you take their shipping,

00:17:15.167 --> 00:17:18.501
they were very aggressive in shipping to begin with,

00:17:18.584 --> 00:17:20.709
extremely aggressive people,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.709
and Greek ships were known for not maintaining at all.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000
They were not very law-abiding

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.584
so they were never used to maintain their ships, you see,

00:17:29.626 --> 00:17:34.459
and always under trouble – the Greeks –

00:17:34.501 --> 00:17:40.125
that in the shipping they were known to be, the Greeks have

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:45.167
ships which are all falling off and rattling.

00:17:46.501 --> 00:17:50.501
So perhaps, perhaps,

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:54.501
they were aware that now the shipping is going to go down,

00:17:54.709 --> 00:17:57.709
so no use maintaining these ships, you see.

00:17:58.501 --> 00:18:02.083
Then when the shipping went down –

00:18:02.125 --> 00:18:05.584
you see this is on economic level I’m saying, how they worked it out

00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000
they sunk their ships

00:18:09.501 --> 00:18:13.501
and got the money out of insurance.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:24.000
That is a typical Greek style of behaviour

00:18:24.083 --> 00:18:29.250
is that they know already. It’s a kind of a wisdom,

00:18:29.542 --> 00:18:32.042
they know that how far to go.

00:18:32.209 --> 00:18:35.667
Like, we can see now, Onassis also married this mad woman,

00:18:36.292 --> 00:18:39.125
Kennedy’s wife, because  he must have realised

00:18:39.125 --> 00:18:43.167
that Kennedy never gave her any security so he married her.

00:18:43.167 --> 00:18:46.626
Alright. He married her up to a point,

00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.083
but most of his property went to his daughter,

00:18:50.083 --> 00:18:52.083
not to Mrs. Kennedy.

00:18:53.334 --> 00:18:59.584
This balance and this wisdom is a special Greek style of life;

00:18:59.584 --> 00:19:03.292
that’s why you might say that they are not over-developed

00:19:03.334 --> 00:19:05.209
like Americans are.

00:19:05.250 --> 00:19:08.417
But now Americans have realised that they are idiots,

00:19:08.542 --> 00:19:10.542
but Greeks can never become idiots,

00:19:10.584 --> 00:19:12.584
whatever you may try.

00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.626
They are very sharp and very intelligent

00:19:17.501 --> 00:19:20.501
but they know how far to go with everything.

00:19:21.542 --> 00:19:24.542
And what is the reason for this? The Athena.

00:19:25.584 --> 00:19:29.459
So Athena is the one, Adi Shakti,

00:19:29.459 --> 00:19:32.459
and She created Ganesha here.

00:19:33.292 --> 00:19:36.584
And the balance of the universe,

00:19:36.584 --> 00:19:40.417
or all the dharmas, is in the Nabhi Chakra,

00:19:40.459 --> 00:19:45.042
and so the people over here are very balanced.

00:19:46.334 --> 00:19:51.209
You can find them very…

00:19:51.334 --> 00:19:56.209
in their language, in their styles, very deep.

00:19:56.501 --> 00:19:59.501
One may say because they are traditional people,

00:19:59.542 --> 00:20:01.542
they have long traditions.

00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000
But Egypt had also long traditions.

00:20:05.626 --> 00:20:08.501
Of course Egyptians are, in a way,

00:20:08.542 --> 00:20:12.417
wiser than all other Islamic countries,

00:20:12.667 --> 00:20:17.667
but not like Greeks, not like Greeks.

00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.250
We have Chinese also who are very wise,

00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:29.000
and they are known to be people of deep understanding,

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.334
but they are not like Indians.

00:20:34.292 --> 00:20:38.292
So what is lacking in all these people is

00:20:39.292 --> 00:20:43.292
the depth of awareness

00:20:44.209 --> 00:20:50.375
because, though in China also Mother of Mercy came

00:20:50.667 --> 00:20:57.626
and She really bestowed blessings upon them,

00:20:58.626 --> 00:21:04.375
and China rose also, afterwards,

00:21:04.501 --> 00:21:07.501
into her own glory

00:21:08.042 --> 00:21:13.542
and became quite a good industrial,

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.417
I mean developed country, we can say, very powerful;

00:21:18.667 --> 00:21:24.292
but still, that kind of regimentation could not be borne

00:21:24.292 --> 00:21:27.042
because, after all, Mother Mercy was there.

00:21:27.542 --> 00:21:29.334
Do you know last…

00:21:29.334 --> 00:21:32.292
you have one Mother Mercy you have given me –

00:21:32.292 --> 00:21:36.250
Kuan Yin, same thing, Kuan Yin.

00:21:36.292 --> 00:21:39.083
And She’s the same thing called as Mother of Mercy –

00:21:39.083 --> 00:21:46.083
and the second one was given by Gregoire recently,

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.542
and you see what’s happening in China.

00:21:51.417 --> 00:21:54.417
So the effects of these

00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.584
Deities which existed in different countries at different times

00:22:04.292 --> 00:22:08.292
are felt only in Kali Yuga in the best way.

00:22:09.209 --> 00:22:11.167
Now you may say that,

00:22:11.209 --> 00:22:15.209
“Why should Mother come last to Greece?”

00:22:16.501 --> 00:22:22.042
Because now Athena is in the Sahastrara,

00:22:22.292 --> 00:22:25.459
so you have to go not in the Nabhi.

00:22:25.584 --> 00:22:29.209
So I had to bring Sahastrara here, isn’t it?

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:32.375
Sahastrara is the last chakra one has to achieve,

00:22:32.375 --> 00:22:37.334
so I thought that let Greeks

00:22:38.459 --> 00:22:42.167
grow up to the Sahastrara point.

00:22:43.250 --> 00:22:46.626
So we have to establish Sahastrara in Greece

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.042
and thus it’s a very powerful work we have to do in Greece

00:22:54.417 --> 00:23:00.209
because actually, at the time

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:02.417
when Athena came here,

00:23:02.459 --> 00:23:06.584
it was not Sahastrara, it was Nabhi,

00:23:07.334 --> 00:23:12.584
because She was actually on the Himalayas, came from Himalayas.

00:23:13.042 --> 00:23:15.626
So now to bring Himalaya here,

00:23:16.125 --> 00:23:21.000
or to bring that purity in Greece, is a tremendous task

00:23:22.292 --> 00:23:24.626
and we have very few sahaja yogis.

00:23:25.292 --> 00:23:28.584
But you see the reaction of the gentleman who came?

00:23:29.083 --> 00:23:36.000
And we have formidable job because of these Orthodox…

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.209
most unorthodox,

00:23:39.334 --> 00:23:42.667
they have no orthodoxy about anything.

00:23:45.292 --> 00:23:50.000
So we have a problem, big problem,

00:23:50.584 --> 00:23:53.584
how we’ll establish here.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.250
The Devaloka was formed here

00:24:00.417 --> 00:24:04.417
and devas were here; they ruled here, no doubt;

00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.417
but in the human awareness they're brought down to the human level.

00:24:10.417 --> 00:24:15.417
Like Zeus was Parashurama, Parashurama –

00:24:15.417 --> 00:24:22.501
the one who was an Incarnation to announce the advent of Shri Rama,

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:30.167
and He came before Shri Ram, died also very much before Shri Ram;

00:24:31.334 --> 00:24:37.334
but they painted Zeus as a man who was a womaniser.

00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.250
So all Gods were brought to the level of human beings,

00:24:43.501 --> 00:24:46.501
bestowed with all the weaknesses, you see,

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:50.542
actually decorated with all the weaknesses.

00:24:51.542 --> 00:24:55.083
And that is responsible for the downfall

00:24:55.125 --> 00:24:59.167
because this part of the country

00:25:01.334 --> 00:25:06.334
is on the pattern of Devaloka,

00:25:07.584 --> 00:25:14.501
reflection of that, but this Devaloka is now,

00:25:15.167 --> 00:25:21.209
we see it has become just the opposite

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:29.375
because Deities have been brought down to such a low level,

00:25:29.417 --> 00:25:32.375
to such degrading things.

00:25:33.125 --> 00:25:39.459
Even in the mythology also, in India

00:25:40.042 --> 00:25:45.542
talks about Them like this. Not to such an extent;

00:25:46.459 --> 00:25:52.209
like Zeus, they don’t talk but about Indra they talk.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:26:01.125
And like Indra’s description comes like this:

00:26:02.417 --> 00:26:09.375
that the king Hiranyakashipu’s wife was living…

00:26:09.501 --> 00:26:15.042
his wife… Hiranyakashipu’s wife was a saintly lady

00:26:15.042 --> 00:26:20.334
and Hiranyakashipu was ruling in the area of

00:26:20.459 --> 00:26:25.501
you can say Kandahar and Afghanistan and all these places,

00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:30.459
and from here Indra went down

00:26:31.501 --> 00:26:34.501
and took away the wife.

00:26:35.501 --> 00:26:39.501
I mean They incarnated, the Gods incarnated here,

00:26:40.542 --> 00:26:43.459
and Indra went down,

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:47.501
He took away the wife of Hiranyakashipu with Him, to save Her,

00:26:47.501 --> 00:26:51.501
and He went down and stayed in an ashram in Maharashtra

00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:56.417
where there’s a river flowing with My name – Nira.

00:26:57.584 --> 00:27:01.125
So now the… see how the combinations are,

00:27:01.167 --> 00:27:08.501
the Shandilya Muni who was the guru of My family –

00:27:08.501 --> 00:27:11.501
that’s why My gotra is Shandilya –

00:27:12.542 --> 00:27:16.042
it was in his ashram He stayed.

00:27:17.501 --> 00:27:20.709
So the Muni Shandilya told

00:27:21.459 --> 00:27:25.000
that, “See, this lady is a very pure lady,

00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:30.501
don’t disturb her, and out of her will come a very great saint

00:27:31.042 --> 00:27:38.042
who will, by his own devotion,

00:27:38.501 --> 00:27:42.501
make the Incarnation of Narasimha –

00:27:43.125 --> 00:27:49.626
this is the god Vishnu which comes as the half-cat –

00:27:51.083 --> 00:27:53.584
and He will kill this asura.

00:27:54.083 --> 00:27:59.083
Now, part of the Egypt was also ruled by this Hiranyakashipu,

00:27:59.083 --> 00:28:03.083
part of the Egypt – see how significant everything is.

00:28:04.542 --> 00:28:06.626
So this Narasimha came

00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:12.501
when…  you know about Prahlada’s story, alright, so this

00:28:13.375 --> 00:28:16.375
little boy played there around and he made some

00:28:16.459 --> 00:28:21.459
things and there’s a temple very near – you have seen Narasimha’s temple

00:28:21.667 --> 00:28:26.584
and that you have seen the statue made out of sand?

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.042
That was made by Prahlad,

00:28:29.167 --> 00:28:32.542
and he came into the dreams of someone and said that,

00:28:32.709 --> 00:28:36.042
“In your temple you please put the statue I have made”,

00:28:36.250 --> 00:28:40.000
and they went around the Nira river and found it and put it there.

00:28:40.334 --> 00:28:43.209
So see the relationship, how it is.

00:28:43.542 --> 00:28:48.459
Now this Hiranyakashipu was killed by Narasimha.

00:28:49.083 --> 00:28:56.501
Narasimha, as you know, is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu,

00:28:57.209 --> 00:29:04.167
because he had, this Hiranyakashipu had, a blessing of Brahmadeva

00:29:04.584 --> 00:29:10.626
that not any animal can kill him,

00:29:10.626 --> 00:29:13.334
not any human being can kill him,

00:29:13.334 --> 00:29:17.334
not on the land or in the sky,

00:29:18.083 --> 00:29:21.000
and not with any weapon –

00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.000
all so many blessings he had taken!

00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:26.709
He had closed all the lines, you see,

00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:29.083
so that nobody should kill him,

00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:35.542
but actually he did not know there are ways and matters.

00:29:36.626 --> 00:29:40.667
So Shri Vishnu took the form of Narasimha,

00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:44.667
is that He became the simha,

00:29:45.167 --> 00:29:50.250
means the ‘lion’, and the lower portion of a man.

00:29:51.417 --> 00:29:56.667
And it so happened that Hiranyakashipu asked Prahlada,

00:29:57.083 --> 00:30:00.209
“Where is your God?” He said, “He’s everywhere.”

00:30:00.209 --> 00:30:04.209
So he said, “Alright, is He in this pillar?”

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.334
He said, “Yes, He’s in this pillar also.”

00:30:07.542 --> 00:30:11.125
So he hit the pillar – see, the pillar

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:14.417
must have been the same style as you make, Greek style,

00:30:14.417 --> 00:30:16.417
pillar of stone,

00:30:16.584 --> 00:30:20.584
so he knew that in the pillar how can anybody be, it’s a stone –

00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.459
he hit it and the pillar broke, out of which came out Narasimha

00:30:27.125 --> 00:30:29.459
with long hands and claws,

00:30:29.584 --> 00:30:32.250
and He took that Hiranyakashipu

00:30:32.417 --> 00:30:37.667
and put him on His lap, because neither on the sky nor on the ground

00:30:38.250 --> 00:30:43.000
and with His claws, because they were not weapons,

00:30:43.250 --> 00:30:45.375
He opened his stomach and killed him.

00:30:47.501 --> 00:30:50.501
So, because he was also ruling in Egypt,

00:30:50.501 --> 00:30:55.167
the people of Egypt made their…

00:30:55.209 --> 00:30:58.584
they were Assyrians – Assyrians are asuras,

00:30:59.584 --> 00:31:02.584
they were the ones who were asuras,

00:31:03.250 --> 00:31:05.250
that’s why they were called Assyrians –

00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:12.000
so they made the statue of their god Sphinx

00:31:12.417 --> 00:31:15.667
the other way round than Narasimha.

00:31:18.375 --> 00:31:23.626
So the upper part of the Sphinx is that of man,

00:31:23.667 --> 00:31:30.667
and the lower part of that statue is that of lion.

00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:35.292
This is very ancient story I’m telling.

00:31:37.542 --> 00:31:43.417
So how the Greeks went to India long time back,

00:31:43.459 --> 00:31:46.459
because all these devas were Greeks –

00:31:47.209 --> 00:31:50.167
and these devas were, like Indra,

00:31:50.167 --> 00:31:53.167
what He did, and Varuna and all these things.

00:31:54.417 --> 00:31:57.334
But I think there… because

00:31:57.375 --> 00:32:01.209
the whole idea got perverted, whole thing,

00:32:01.626 --> 00:32:07.626
they could not see the proper image of their...

00:32:09.209 --> 00:32:14.626
of their...faces in their meditation

00:32:15.167 --> 00:32:17.042
because they perverted them

00:32:17.042 --> 00:32:20.042
so they could not see, and they saw perverted faces.

00:32:20.042 --> 00:32:24.209
They saw them nude and that kind of thing,

00:32:24.209 --> 00:32:27.000
which was all their own imagination

00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.125
working, because they were indulging into all kinds of immoral things

00:32:31.167 --> 00:32:37.209
so they made it absolutely, what you call a ...

00:32:38.042 --> 00:32:44.584
very immoral type of relationships and things among them.

00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:47.250
So that was their own ideas and they put it.

00:32:47.292 --> 00:32:50.584
But also, as a result of that, they could never see

00:32:50.626 --> 00:32:55.667
the body or the faces of these devatas properly.

00:32:55.667 --> 00:32:59.667
So they made them more like…

00:33:01.083 --> 00:33:04.375
I mean quite ugly-looking faces they made.

00:33:04.417 --> 00:33:07.292
Like I have some Poseidon they have made here

00:33:07.292 --> 00:33:10.501
which they gave it to My husband also – it’s not at all

00:33:10.542 --> 00:33:13.000
like Varuna, I can tell you.

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.167
So… and absolutely nude, you know; it’s so embarrassing.

00:33:16.167 --> 00:33:18.667
They gave it to My husband and he didn’t know where to look,

00:33:18.667 --> 00:33:24.167
and I just started laughing because he’s a very shy man, My husband.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.209
And he had to put it in his office, you see,

00:33:27.209 --> 00:33:30.334
hidden somewhere and it looks very funny.

00:33:31.250 --> 00:33:36.209
And he was saying, “Why not we use a kind of a...

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:43.042
covering with some silver?” I said, “It’s an antique

00:33:43.042 --> 00:33:45.626
they have reproduced; you can’t do it to an antique.”

00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:47.334
He said, “Alright; where should I put it?”

00:33:47.334 --> 00:33:51.125
I said, “Put it in some corridor there.”

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.250
So with such expense they gave it

00:33:55.292 --> 00:33:59.125
but My husband was quite upset about it, you see,

00:34:00.209 --> 00:34:03.125
and every time he sees this gentleman he says,

00:34:03.125 --> 00:34:09.709
“You know, this gentleman is no good.”

00:34:10.334 --> 00:34:18.209
Alright. So then, this part of the history is there.

00:34:18.459 --> 00:34:22.709
On that history stands the modern Greek.

00:34:24.042 --> 00:34:29.501
So, if you see from Socrates to Christ,

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.375
people had evolved we think,

00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:36.000
but they also crucified Christ,

00:34:37.083 --> 00:34:39.083
so what was their evolution?

00:34:39.250 --> 00:34:46.125
Though, if you see what Christ preached and what…

00:34:46.459 --> 00:34:51.459
I’m sorry, what Christ preached and Socrates preached,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.584
there is much difference

00:34:55.375 --> 00:35:00.375
because Socrates talked in parables, not openly,

00:35:01.292 --> 00:35:05.209
while Socrates talked in a very open way,

00:35:05.209 --> 00:35:08.334
in an open discussion, in open understanding.

00:35:08.459 --> 00:35:12.417
That shows only that the people could understand what He was saying.

00:35:12.584 --> 00:35:16.000
But still He was also killed;

00:35:16.459 --> 00:35:20.375
Socrates also was given poison and He was also killed.

00:35:20.626 --> 00:35:25.042
So that shows that, at that time also, the people in charge,

00:35:25.250 --> 00:35:29.250
or at the helm of affairs, didn’t know what was reality.

00:35:30.209 --> 00:35:35.501
So now, from Christ to Socrates and from Socrates to Me,

00:35:36.083 --> 00:35:39.626
we can say this way that we are talking about it,

00:35:40.083 --> 00:35:46.083
though Socrates came in the year – how much B.C. He was?

00:35:46.167 --> 00:35:50.501
Yogi: About 500 years before Christ

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.125
500 before Christ;

00:35:52.417 --> 00:35:58.334
so might be that Christ must have felt that Socrates,

00:35:58.459 --> 00:36:02.167
He talked so openly, so nicely to people

00:36:02.501 --> 00:36:05.459
as because He was Primordial Master.

00:36:06.334 --> 00:36:10.334
He realised it, so He talked in parables.

00:36:12.083 --> 00:36:15.501
He thought that, “No use talking straight like Socrates”

00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:20.709
because… you see they are very straightforward people;

00:36:21.584 --> 00:36:25.501
the Primordial Masters have to be very, very…

00:36:25.501 --> 00:36:29.459
they are by nature extremely straightforward.

00:36:30.125 --> 00:36:34.375
Even today’s… those who were real gurus,

00:36:34.375 --> 00:36:38.375
they would not accept any person,

00:36:38.375 --> 00:36:41.292
they would throw away, they would beat people.

00:36:41.334 --> 00:36:45.459
Even musicians in India, those who are great masters,

00:36:45.501 --> 00:36:48.209
they would beat their disciples if they played something wrong;

00:36:48.209 --> 00:36:50.125
like very harsh people.

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.667
So it was alright for Socrates also to tell things very

00:36:54.667 --> 00:36:58.000
plain and simple and all that, but still He was killed.

00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:01.292
And then Christ, who was 500 years later came.

00:37:01.542 --> 00:37:03.584
See, He saw the point

00:37:04.250 --> 00:37:07.626
that no use talking – because He came at Agya –

00:37:08.167 --> 00:37:10.042
talking in that way.

00:37:10.042 --> 00:37:13.209
If you tell somebody, “Don’t do like this”,

00:37:13.209 --> 00:37:15.542
even reason it out like Socrates did,

00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.334
He is the master of logic, you can call Him;

00:37:19.501 --> 00:37:22.459
the whole logic system comes from Him,

00:37:23.292 --> 00:37:25.292
He’s a master of logic.

00:37:25.292 --> 00:37:31.000
But despite that, it did not appeal to the logic of the people who were at the helm of affairs.

00:37:31.501 --> 00:37:35.167
So they have no logic in their heads, you see, they are just rationalist.

00:37:35.292 --> 00:37:39.667
Rationality is blindness but there’s no logic.

00:37:40.292 --> 00:37:44.000
So because there is no logic they killed Him.

00:37:44.167 --> 00:37:47.417
And Christ understood that there is no logic

00:37:47.626 --> 00:37:50.626
with these people so better talk to them in parables.

00:37:51.334 --> 00:37:54.042
So He talked to them in parables,

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:56.667
but still they killed Him.

00:37:57.626 --> 00:38:02.459
[ Helm! ] The authorities, they couldn’t bear, they thought

00:38:02.459 --> 00:38:06.667
He’s becoming very powerful, or whatever it was. The Jews themselves

00:38:07.292 --> 00:38:10.292
were very funny, and they did it.

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:17.584
So in Sahaja Yoga, what I decided that at least

00:38:18.167 --> 00:38:21.542
I should give Realisation to people first,

00:38:23.334 --> 00:38:26.709
and then I can talk to them whatever I like.

00:38:27.167 --> 00:38:30.000
Now, I’m talking to you everything

00:38:30.042 --> 00:38:33.083
and you are understanding it because you are Realised souls,

00:38:33.083 --> 00:38:36.083
but I cannot talk this to an ordinary person.

00:38:36.459 --> 00:38:41.167
So we have two types of people: one who are Sahaja Yogis,

00:38:41.501 --> 00:38:43.375
and one who are not.

00:38:43.375 --> 00:38:47.459
Of course there are some Sahaja Yogis who are not very worthy of this,

00:38:47.542 --> 00:38:52.000
I agree, and they may just go back or something,

00:38:52.125 --> 00:38:58.334
but you can become worthy of understanding all this knowledge

00:38:58.334 --> 00:39:02.334
because your Kundalini can make you so capable

00:39:02.334 --> 00:39:06.334
and your Sahastrara so good that you can absorb what I’m saying,

00:39:06.375 --> 00:39:10.000
and can logically see what I’m saying is true,

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.542
and you can also verify it, whether it is true or not.

00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.417
So this stage of yours, I think, is the highest stage of awareness

00:39:19.459 --> 00:39:22.501
where collectively you are understanding Me.

00:39:22.501 --> 00:39:25.584
The situation is not so bad as that was

00:39:25.709 --> 00:39:28.417
even at the time of Christ.

00:39:28.417 --> 00:39:30.542
Before that, at Socrates’ time, I think,

00:39:30.542 --> 00:39:33.542
He was the only wise man going around.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:36.501
There was nobody else, seems to Me, had any wisdom.

00:39:36.501 --> 00:39:39.542
Even His disciples, you see, like Plato –

00:39:39.542 --> 00:39:43.501
he went off his head, then Aristotle went off his head.

00:39:44.083 --> 00:39:47.209
Both of them, really,

00:39:47.542 --> 00:39:51.125
tried to have their own arbitrary additions

00:39:51.125 --> 00:39:53.292
which were all absolutely.

00:39:53.375 --> 00:39:56.292
But He talked absolutely…

00:39:56.334 --> 00:40:00.501
Socrates talked absolutely about gods and everything,

00:40:00.626 --> 00:40:02.626
and talked so openly.

00:40:03.209 --> 00:40:06.417
Then, in the same way, we can say,

00:40:06.626 --> 00:40:09.584
the Primordial Master state is that

00:40:10.042 --> 00:40:13.417
we have Mohammad Sahib. He was also killed;

00:40:14.501 --> 00:40:18.459
He was also killed because He told the truth.

00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.584
Then came Nanaka;

00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000
He was not killed but nobody bothered about Him,

00:40:26.417 --> 00:40:30.292
and the people who really follow Him are just

00:40:31.501 --> 00:40:33.417
in the opposite direction.

00:40:33.417 --> 00:40:36.000
Supposing He was saying, “Come this way”;

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.167
so they are going in that way.

00:40:39.209 --> 00:40:43.125
You find even same thing with Christ;

00:40:43.125 --> 00:40:47.459
if Christ said, “Come this way” the Christians are going that way.

00:40:48.167 --> 00:40:51.125
Every religion is just the same.

00:40:51.125 --> 00:40:54.000
Same with Krishna’s Gita.

00:40:54.125 --> 00:40:57.542
Those who preach Gita are just…

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.209
if Krishna is standing here and saying,

00:41:00.250 --> 00:41:03.083
“Come this way” Gita is saying, they are preaching Gita

00:41:03.083 --> 00:41:05.542
going down, taking people down.

00:41:05.542 --> 00:41:08.542
So it is common with all religions

00:41:09.501 --> 00:41:14.292
that they have always used the name of prophets

00:41:15.125 --> 00:41:21.501
and of all the Incarnations just to make money

00:41:21.501 --> 00:41:28.501
and to take everybody to hell; straightforward march to hell you see.

00:41:29.501 --> 00:41:32.000
So, now those who are alert about it,

00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:36.042
and those who have seen that this is all nonsense are in Sahaja Yoga

00:41:37.667 --> 00:41:39.667
and sahaja yogis can’t do that

00:41:40.042 --> 00:41:43.667
because they have come quite a long way now on this side,

00:41:44.250 --> 00:41:48.250
so they are going to pull out many others to that side

00:41:49.334 --> 00:41:52.209
instead of going themselves down.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:58.083
So this is the situation today, and that’s why I say Greece

00:41:58.250 --> 00:42:02.083
is a very wonderful area where we can work it out.

00:42:02.083 --> 00:42:04.709
If Athena could be awakened here,

00:42:05.042 --> 00:42:09.000
this place could be of very great help to us.

00:42:09.584 --> 00:42:15.209
Now there are very balanced Greek people,

00:42:15.209 --> 00:42:20.000
they have great sense of art because of Right-side Swadhishthana;

00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:25.584
also they have lots of qualities of

00:42:25.584 --> 00:42:32.125
understanding the worthlessness of

00:42:32.417 --> 00:42:39.083
too much indulgences and all that. It is so.

00:42:39.250 --> 00:42:41.459
But the immorality grew,

00:42:41.459 --> 00:42:45.083
now, because they started copying Westerners;

00:42:45.250 --> 00:42:48.501
otherwise the women here were very moral women.

00:42:49.042 --> 00:42:53.167
This is only in these twenty years this change has come.

00:42:53.501 --> 00:42:57.042
Before that the women were very moral,

00:42:57.042 --> 00:42:59.501
very good women lived here,

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:04.417
and some of them are now in India as I told you, they came with Alexander,

00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:09.000
and they were very good husbands and wives and very good families.

00:43:09.042 --> 00:43:11.375
This is only – I don’t know why – about twenty years

00:43:11.375 --> 00:43:14.000
or twenty-five years at the most, you can say,

00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000
the Kali Yuga is showing its effects here also,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.626
but it’s a very solid country and still they respect,

00:43:21.042 --> 00:43:25.042
respect a woman who has character; respect her.

00:43:25.501 --> 00:43:28.417
They may use a woman who has no character

00:43:28.417 --> 00:43:30.626
but they respect the woman who has character

00:43:30.626 --> 00:43:33.000
and also respect the mother.

00:43:33.125 --> 00:43:36.417
So there are lots of qualities in this country

00:43:36.459 --> 00:43:40.083
which are still existing,

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:44.626
in some places lingering, and some places effective.

00:43:45.042 --> 00:43:49.042
So the job of Sahaja Yogis is to, somehow or other,

00:43:49.167 --> 00:43:55.334
evoke that integrating force in them of the Athena,

00:43:55.375 --> 00:43:58.667
and I’m sure you can purify this country.

00:43:59.209 --> 00:44:01.250
May God bless you!

00:44:18.292 --> 00:44:21.375
Alexander was two hundred before Christ…

00:44:21.375 --> 00:44:24.292
a hundred, two hundred before Christ.

00:44:37.250 --> 00:44:41.250
He was very much respected in India, always,

00:44:42.083 --> 00:44:45.083
Alexander was very much respected in India,

00:44:45.334 --> 00:44:48.334
and because he went away

00:44:49.042 --> 00:44:52.042
and he didn’t take away anything from India.

00:44:53.250 --> 00:44:57.501
Like any other invaders who came, who just looted us, he did not.

00:44:58.542 --> 00:45:00.709
I think he got quite detached

00:45:01.167 --> 00:45:04.375
after coming to India. Anybody who has

00:45:04.375 --> 00:45:08.542
come to invade India, and has really gained something

00:45:08.542 --> 00:45:11.667
out of the spirituality of India, was Alexander;

00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000
otherwise the English lived for three hundred in India,

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.167
three hundred years.

00:45:16.167 --> 00:45:19.125
Nothing went into their heads, nothing.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:23.000
Three hundred years! Can you believe it?

00:45:23.375 --> 00:45:27.042
They used to laugh at everything, they used to make fun of everything,

00:45:27.250 --> 00:45:29.250
nothing went into their heads.

00:45:31.167 --> 00:45:34.709
But so many Greeks stayed on because they liked India very much,

00:45:35.083 --> 00:45:37.626
so they stayed back, they wouldn’t come back.

00:45:37.626 --> 00:45:41.626
So many are there even now living in the forests.

00:45:43.042 --> 00:45:47.501
So, this is something, is the sensitivity, the awareness,

00:45:47.501 --> 00:45:51.000
which has grown through times in the Greek people.

00:45:51.209 --> 00:45:54.417
You can see in the character of Alexander, how he was.

00:45:54.417 --> 00:45:58.125
There’s a poet in India called Chandav Rai,

00:45:58.417 --> 00:46:02.000
who was at the time of Alexander.

00:46:02.209 --> 00:46:06.709
Alexander brought him here, honoured him, kept him here,

00:46:07.083 --> 00:46:10.209
he was here, and he wrote poems about Alexander,

00:46:10.334 --> 00:46:13.375
about his greatness and things, praised him so well.

00:46:14.042 --> 00:46:18.626
I mean I can’t think of English people carrying any Indian as a poet

00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.167
to England;

00:46:22.250 --> 00:46:24.167
there’s no question. I mean, they didn’t…

00:46:24.167 --> 00:46:27.167
and the sign of awareness is this, that

00:46:27.167 --> 00:46:30.501
you don’t respect anybody else, you say, “Oh, I am the greatest”.

00:46:31.334 --> 00:46:35.334
Then you cannot see the goodness of other people.

00:46:36.042 --> 00:46:40.125
Same with Portuguese. Of course, Vasco de Gama was a simple man

00:46:40.292 --> 00:46:43.459
and when he came first to India, he saw Indians

00:46:43.459 --> 00:46:47.250
and he went to Goa and he saw the temple of the Goddess

00:46:47.292 --> 00:46:49.000
there, is the Shanta Durga’s,

00:46:49.083 --> 00:46:51.042
so he went back and told his king that,

00:46:51.042 --> 00:46:54.167
“They are all Christians because they follow the Mother.

00:46:54.167 --> 00:46:56.083
They are not Muslims”.

00:46:58.459 --> 00:47:00.042
So simple he was.

00:47:00.042 --> 00:47:03.250
“There’s no need to make them Christians.

00:47:03.250 --> 00:47:06.167
They are already Christians because they follow Mother”.

00:47:06.667 --> 00:47:08.042
He was a nice man.

00:47:08.042 --> 00:47:11.167
But Portuguese also never learned anything much,

00:47:11.167 --> 00:47:13.584
but still certain respect they showed, like

00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.375
the name of Bombay is Mumbai.

00:47:17.250 --> 00:47:19.083
They still call it Mumbai.

00:47:19.375 --> 00:47:21.125
many words Mumbai

00:47:21.250 --> 00:47:25.375
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi, Mumbai  is the name.

00:47:25.501 --> 00:47:28.167
Means she is the Mother of Mumba.

00:47:28.292 --> 00:47:29.667
Like ‘ayi’ is the Mother,

00:47:30.125 --> 00:47:32.125
so they call it Mumbai –

00:47:32.375 --> 00:47:34.375
is the name of the Goddess.

00:47:34.584 --> 00:47:36.584
So they didn’t want to change it.

00:47:37.083 --> 00:47:40.125
And in Portugal, when I went, they were saying “Mumbai”.

00:47:40.292 --> 00:47:42.250
is the Mumba. Mumba-ayi is the name.

00:47:42.292 --> 00:47:44.501
“After all, it’s the name of the Goddess; isn’t it?”

00:47:44.584 --> 00:47:46.083
I said, “It is.”

00:47:46.375 --> 00:47:50.000
But the English came, called it “Bombay”- finished.

00:47:53.375 --> 00:47:56.501
So you see the… see the awareness,

00:47:56.501 --> 00:47:59.167
you can see the awareness of people

00:47:59.334 --> 00:48:04.542
because they were so aware about the serenity,

00:48:04.584 --> 00:48:08.167
about the holiness, about the auspiciousness and all that,

00:48:08.292 --> 00:48:10.042
so they said, “How can we call it Bombay

00:48:10.042 --> 00:48:12.584
because it is the name of the Goddess?”

00:48:13.375 --> 00:48:16.626
Just think- the depth, no? “We cannot call.”

00:48:17.042 --> 00:48:19.292
But the English could have gone and found out

00:48:19.292 --> 00:48:23.167
what is this place called, why is it called Mumbai.

00:48:23.250 --> 00:48:24.459
But they did not.

00:48:24.459 --> 00:48:27.459
But even if they had found, I don’t think they would have

00:48:27.501 --> 00:48:30.167
kept it as Mumbai. They would not have

00:48:30.667 --> 00:48:33.667
because, you see, that respect

00:48:34.209 --> 00:48:36.542
for serenity and all these things,

00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.334
somehow or other, in these people who ruled us, it was not there.

00:48:41.417 --> 00:48:45.292
Now the children of Britain

00:48:45.501 --> 00:48:49.042
are better, are very different, very different.

00:48:49.292 --> 00:48:52.667
But those who ruled us had no respect at all.

00:48:54.083 --> 00:49:00.209
They would only go to church, and nothing, no respect.

00:49:01.209 --> 00:49:05.209
While the Greeks had always respect for Indians,

00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.375
they came with respect.

00:49:08.584 --> 00:49:14.542
Now, the respect, also, is a kind of an awareness within us.

00:49:15.501 --> 00:49:17.501
And now, as the time has passed,

00:49:17.501 --> 00:49:20.083
I find Britishers have respect for others,

00:49:20.459 --> 00:49:23.667
they’re respecting, many.

00:49:23.667 --> 00:49:27.125
I mean, I would not say all, but quite a lot, isn’t it.

00:49:27.125 --> 00:49:31.083
Well, what do you say? He has not met any.

00:49:36.375 --> 00:49:40.375
Yes, that’s the part lacking- respect.

00:49:40.709 --> 00:49:43.209
That is the part lacking in England.

00:49:43.334 --> 00:49:46.667
And imagine in the heart, if there is no respect,

00:49:47.042 --> 00:49:49.375
then what sort of a heart it must be?

00:49:50.209 --> 00:49:53.209
The whole world can get ruined by that heart.

00:49:56.417 --> 00:50:03.584
So that’s the thing – one has to create respect:

00:50:04.125 --> 00:50:10.167
respecting others, respecting their culture,

00:50:10.167 --> 00:50:14.292
respecting their lifestyle.

00:50:14.542 --> 00:50:20.042
But, I mean whatever you may say, but theoretically it is there;

00:50:20.375 --> 00:50:24.000
may not be in practice. Theoretically it is working,

00:50:24.375 --> 00:50:27.209
because you’re not supposed to insult anybody

00:50:27.375 --> 00:50:30.584
who is from the ethnic group and all that is there legally,

00:50:31.083 --> 00:50:33.626
theoretically; but in practice it is not,

00:50:33.626 --> 00:50:36.626
I agree; but theoretically it is working.

00:50:37.292 --> 00:50:42.125
You can’t insult somebody because he’s a black man or he’s

00:50:42.292 --> 00:50:45.709
an ethnic group, you cannot, under law, you cannot do it.

00:50:46.042 --> 00:50:49.125
So that is there but just theory.

00:50:49.292 --> 00:50:53.042
But still, awareness-wise also, people are aware.

00:50:53.209 --> 00:50:58.626
I know of so many of them who were sitting in the sun

00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:02.000
and fasting for South Africa.

00:51:03.417 --> 00:51:05.709
So between the South African awareness

00:51:06.083 --> 00:51:09.417
and British awareness, we must say, we should be proud

00:51:09.542 --> 00:51:13.542
that in British awareness there is lot of sense,

00:51:14.501 --> 00:51:19.334
and that sense, once it comes to the point of respecting others,

00:51:19.459 --> 00:51:22.459
I think it can transform the whole world.

00:51:23.042 --> 00:51:26.501
But I don’t know how I have to do it, I’ve tried.

00:51:27.375 --> 00:51:29.417
It has to be respect.

00:51:34.250 --> 00:51:36.375
It is not insulting now,

00:51:36.584 --> 00:51:40.042
but it is not positive respect.

00:51:40.209 --> 00:51:44.125
So one has to learn how to positively respect;

00:51:44.125 --> 00:51:47.709
at least Sahaja Yogis must be positively respected.

00:51:47.709 --> 00:51:50.626
This is what I have been talking about,

00:51:51.042 --> 00:51:54.417
about Buddha, about truth, about respect.

00:51:55.250 --> 00:51:59.375
But once you know that they are Sahaja Yogis, one has to respect.

00:51:59.709 --> 00:52:02.125
And this one has to learn from the Greeks

00:52:02.125 --> 00:52:05.125
because still they have a sense of respect.

00:52:08.083 --> 00:52:12.083
They know how to respect, isn’t it?

00:52:13.292 --> 00:52:17.459
That part is there, that one has to learn.

00:52:17.459 --> 00:52:21.459
Even the Egyptians are, and also the Chinese,

00:52:22.542 --> 00:52:28.542
because out of all these years of traditional growth,

00:52:29.167 --> 00:52:32.375
they have realised one thing: that if you have to really

00:52:32.375 --> 00:52:36.334
exist in this world you have to learn how to respect others.

00:52:41.334 --> 00:52:43.709
And respect is something from your heart.

00:52:44.292 --> 00:52:48.125
Like the Japanese have no respect for anyone

00:52:48.250 --> 00:52:50.542
but they’ll go and bow ten times,

00:52:51.501 --> 00:52:55.292
don’t know when to stop if they bow, and if you bow they’ll go on,

00:52:55.292 --> 00:52:58.459
permanently, so it’s best if you stop.

00:52:58.459 --> 00:53:01.709
But it’s artificial; it’s not real.

00:53:04.292 --> 00:53:08.542
So it should come from your innate being to respect others,

00:53:09.375 --> 00:53:12.417
and when that works out then

00:53:12.417 --> 00:53:16.125
your awareness has definitely reached a very high state,

00:53:16.334 --> 00:53:21.250
high state of understanding of Divinity.

00:53:21.501 --> 00:53:26.501
So then you come to a point of respecting the Adi Shakti

00:53:27.125 --> 00:53:31.125
and then, when you have respect, it’s not artificial respect,

00:53:31.501 --> 00:53:34.667
it’s not artificial, it should be from your heart.

00:53:34.667 --> 00:53:38.667
And once you start doing that your awareness will improve.

00:53:39.334 --> 00:53:41.584
And that it’s not what you get,

00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.167
it’s not what you have,

00:53:44.292 --> 00:53:49.292
but what you give to yourself by respecting.

00:53:52.375 --> 00:53:56.417
And this respect in which transform you completely, I can tell you,

00:53:56.501 --> 00:53:58.626
because there’s a big understanding

00:53:58.626 --> 00:54:00.709
now between you and the Divine,

00:54:01.042 --> 00:54:03.501
and I’m sure everything will work out very well.

00:54:03.584 --> 00:54:07.584
The way the Deities respect the Adi Shakti, if you also

00:54:08.667 --> 00:54:13.042
learn that respect, then things will work out.

00:54:13.083 --> 00:54:15.209
And I think Greeks will lead us very well,

00:54:15.250 --> 00:54:18.709
the whole of Europe, in this respect; I’m sure about it.

00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:20.459
May God bless you!
