TC BC 2017-0317

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,200
So first of all we’ll start talking about energies.

5
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:18,999
These energies are moving

6
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,879
within us and how they activate

7
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:26,200
and we’ll talk about the third energy

8
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:29,440
which is the one which has evolved us

9
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:31,680
and that’s how we are here.

10
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,879
And we’ll talk about your Self, the controlling part,

11
00:00:36,999 --> 00:00:41,999
which is controlling you, the Spirit.

12
00:00:43,999 --> 00:00:46,879
So if you go on an abstract line,

13
00:00:46,999 --> 00:00:49,560
it will be very appealing [?]  with it.

14
00:00:55,999 --> 00:00:57,879
Then afterwards, you see,

15
00:00:57,999 --> 00:01:00,400
when we have talked about energies, this, that,

16
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:02,640
once the people- that is within you- you see,

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,600
sort of they’ll feel ego, this ego: “we have these energies

18
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:08,640
we can utilize these energies, do this, do that”

19
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,720
and then you’ll bring them down to Sahaja Yoga, later on.

20
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,800
But to begin with, better talk of abstract.

21
00:01:15,999 --> 00:01:20,040
Because Indians are different, Western people are different,

22
00:01:23,999 --> 00:01:26,879
they are fed up of religion, they are fed up of all this.

23
00:01:26,999 --> 00:01:30,999
So if you talk of religion, it gives, creates a problem.

24
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:36,200
That’s why in the beginning, you see, Vedas, they were written down.

25
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,680
They didn’t talk of God or Deities at all.

26
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:43,800
They talked about God, God the Creator,

27
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,400
but just about Brahmadeva,

28
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:49,999
throughout Hiranyagarbha, Brahmadeva, right side they talked, you see.

29
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,879
And the all thing is said, mantra is like :

30
00:01:53,999 --> 00:01:58,999
“Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha”. 3 things. Now, Bhur is actually

31
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:05,680
the Mooladhara, is the earth upper it, the Mooladhara.

32
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,879
Mooladhara chakra and Mooladhara itself.

33
00:02:07,999 --> 00:02:13,080
Then Bhuvah. Bhuvah is the one which is called the antariksha

34
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,879
[atmosphere, intermediate space], is the one which is all created,

35
00:02:16,999 --> 00:02:20,760
in talks of Brahmadeva.

36
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:26,680
Then swaha. Swaha is capacity to burn out,

37
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:30,999
of the agny [fire] you see?

38
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,879
It is so surprising and then they talk of mahatapa,

39
00:02:37,999 --> 00:02:44,999
tapaha and maha. “Bhur, Bhuvah, swaha, maha tapa”.

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:49,879
So when they talk of swaha, they talk of maha.

41
00:02:49,999 --> 00:02:58,760
Maha is what you call the great, Allah Hou Akbar, and of tapa.

42
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:03,440
Tapa is the one where you have to become a tapasuy,

43
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:08,920
means a person who is going into penance, that of Christ.

44
00:03:11,999 --> 00:03:16,640
And they say that you have to penetrate through the Surya,

45
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,040
that is this. And the all thing is such an obstacle,

46
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,040
and then you get your moksha.

47
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,320
So they have talked of all the chakras.

48
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,800
But if you talk about the abstract part of it,

49
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:30,879
people have no objection, they listen to it,

50
00:03:30,999 --> 00:03:36,999
listen as [inaudible] there’s no religion as such.

51
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:46,040
Today specially I'm talking about the Vedas

52
00:03:46,999 --> 00:03:50,800
and these havanas we do.

53
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:56,999
When we do the havana it is a Yagnya.

54
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:04,560
Yagnya means "by which you know". ‘nya’ means to know. Yagna.

55
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:10,520
And this is done where you use 'Svaha' as the word.

56
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:18,879
That means you use the principle of fire

57
00:04:18,999 --> 00:04:25,400
to burn off all that is wrong in you, 'Svaha'.

58
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,360
And you awaken it by taking the different names of the God.

59
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,280
And it started at the time of Rama.

60
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,640
Today is Ram Navami.

61
00:04:38,999 --> 00:04:41,120
I should say it was not started, we should say,

62
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,280
but it was very much invoked when Rama lived

63
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,360
and they used to do Yagnyas at that time.

64
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,879
The reason was, the people had just started realizing

65
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:56,999
that there is something higher

66
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,360
and you have to worship that higher Self, the seers said,

67
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,999
and they thought that the best thing is to do Yagnyas.

68
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,120
On the left side, of course, the people started the worship of God

69
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,879
and the dedication to God and all those things,

70
00:05:15,999 --> 00:05:21,879
that is Bhakti , but mainly what they did

71
00:05:21,999 --> 00:05:28,200
before Rama was the Yagnyas, the Vedas,

72
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:31,879
with which they prayed to different elements

73
00:05:31,999 --> 00:05:34,879
- elements have made our chakras –

74
00:05:34,999 --> 00:05:39,040
and tried to evoke the deities of the Elements.

75
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,999
But actually it amounts to the same.

76
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:56,640
So as a child, Rama was studying with a very great saint,

77
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,999
and when he was studying with him,

78
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:07,200
Vashishta was the name of the great saint.

79
00:06:07,999 --> 00:06:16,879
And Vashishta had an ashram where Rama and his brothers studied.

80
00:06:16,999 --> 00:06:19,600
Shri Mataji to a lady: come along, come in, come forward.

81
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,879
Give her a chair to sit down. Can you, is there a seat here?

82
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:28,400
I think Gavin can go, lots of seats are there.

83
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:49,160
Rama was studying with this Vashishta

84
00:06:49,999 --> 00:06:54,400
and they used to come for holidays to father's place.

85
00:06:54,999 --> 00:07:04,879
Then, he had the capacity to kill a demon with only one arrow.

86
00:07:04,999 --> 00:07:08,879
It’s called as ekabani. One arrow was sufficient of Sri Rama.

87
00:07:08,999 --> 00:07:14,280
And he was a small little child, say about seven, eight years of age.

88
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,999
And people were surprised how he could do it.

89
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:21,160
So whenever they had a yagnya

90
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:27,760
– now these yagnyas were created to awaken, evoke, the Deities

91
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:31,320
inside the spinal chord – actually.

92
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,879
And for these yagnyas they used to sit down

93
00:07:34,999 --> 00:07:38,360
and do all these havanas the way we do it.

94
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:43,760
But at that time, the rakshasas would come and try to spoil the yagnyas,

95
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:47,920
because yagnyas are to be done with pure heart

96
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:52,640
and with cleanliness and with purity, it should not be insulted,

97
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
there’s a protocol about it.

98
00:07:54,999 --> 00:07:58,879
While they thought that, “If we insult the Deities there,

99
00:07:58,999 --> 00:08:02,879
then the Deities will disappear and their yagnyas will be spoiled.”

100
00:08:02,999 --> 00:08:08,920
Now these yagnyas were done, in the olden times even, even when

101
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,440
Rama was not here. But at the time of Rama also,

102
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,640
there were some rakshasas

103
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:21,280
who took a special pleasure in spoiling these yagnyas

104
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:27,680
and Rama as a child would go and protect them from the demons.

105
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,879
And the demons would take some sort of a funny form

106
00:08:30,999 --> 00:08:39,960
and come like invisible creatures and put some bones

107
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,879
of animals and things like that in the yagnya.

108
00:08:43,999 --> 00:08:48,200
And that would spoil the effects of the yagnya.

109
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:52,680
And Rama would protect that, as a child.

110
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:55,560
Imagine, as a child he used to do that!

111
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,879
They would be doing the yagnya and he would be sitting outside

112
00:08:58,999 --> 00:09:02,560
with all his small brothers around him

113
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:07,360
and they would kill the demons who would try to destroy the yagnyas.

114
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:14,999
This is the early life of Rama in which you see

115
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:24,280
how, as a child also, he showed an amount of

116
00:09:30,999 --> 00:09:34,879
expertise, you can say, in arrow and bow.

117
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:37,920
So any time you see a statue

118
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:41,920
– how to make out a Shri Rama’s statue, is to see if there’s an arrow

119
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:45,800
and a bow, then its a Rama’s statue.

120
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:58,879
Now his coming on this Earth,   gave us the development of the Right Side

121
00:09:58,999 --> 00:10:02,680
and so the yagnyas were also on the Right Side.

122
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:06,760
Because first of all when human beings came on this Earth,

123
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,999
they were frightened of all the animals who would invade them

124
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,640
and all kinds of horrible rakshasas and all those people,

125
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,040
and negative forces they would trouble them.

126
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:25,879
So, in that state they needed to create a king, a ruler,

127
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:31,840
who was an ideal king and he would rule according to the laws of dharma.

128
00:10:31,999 --> 00:10:38,120
So He was the one in charge of that era,

129
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:43,760
what we call as Satya Yuga you can say, but actually,

130
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:47,800
He was here in Treta Yuga.

131
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,879
That’s the time when He as here, that’s Treta Yuga,

132
00:10:51,999 --> 00:10:55,080
and Krishna came at the lime of Dwapar Yuga.

133
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:01,879
And today is the time, when I came it was Kali Yuga.

134
00:11:01,999 --> 00:11:05,960
But now, today, the time is of Krita Yuga,

135
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:10,879
the Yuga where work will be done: ‘Krita’ means, “work will be done”.

136
00:11:10,999 --> 00:11:14,879
This is the time where work will be done.

137
00:11:14,999 --> 00:11:17,400
So how things have moved from one to another?

138
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:20,960
Now in the Dwapar Yuga when Shri Rama came,

139
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:30,640
the idea of kingship and rulership started.

140
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:43,120
So the greatest emphasis was on the goodwill of the people.

141
00:11:43,999 --> 00:11:47,879
The people had to have goodwill:

142
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:57,840
for the people and for the king, and for the betterment of humanity.

143
00:11:57,999 --> 00:12:00,879
The will, that is the Right Side.

144
00:12:00,999 --> 00:12:04,280
So how to create the goodwill in people?

145
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:11,080
First the leader has to sacrifice and show how far he can go

146
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:17,520
in sacrificing to keep the moral and the goodwill of the people.

147
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:21,560
So the Right Side was created by the advent of Shri Rama

148
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:30,999
because he showed a path of creating among people the awareness

149
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:37,999
that they should be ruled, that they should not be anarchist,

150
00:12:38,120 --> 00:12:41,840
there should be one head who should be able

151
00:12:41,999 --> 00:12:48,800
to organize, co-ordinate and work out a collective thing.

152
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,999
You see, when we think of a king we want to oust him

153
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,999
because we don’t like the idea of being ruled someone.

154
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:05,080
Because he’s not a good king perhaps, o

155
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,879
or he doesn’t represent that will of the people

156
00:13:09,999 --> 00:13:14,879
which is a common will which creates this king

157
00:13:14,999 --> 00:13:19,200
who rules for the maintenance of that goodwill.

158
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,320
It is a symbolic expression of your goodwill.

159
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,200
So when you create a law, it is also the expression,

160
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:32,520
common expression, of all the common people,

161
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:37,520
of the common feeling that they should abide with law.

162
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:44,600
It doesn’t come to you that you are a slave,

163
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:47,879
or you are to be dominated, or you have to be put down,

164
00:13:47,999 --> 00:13:51,879
but it is only your common will, which is good.

165
00:13:51,999 --> 00:14:01,999
The desire of all the people which is the good, righteousness,

166
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:10,040
incarnates as Shri Rama and He looks after that will.

167
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:12,960
Because, supposing an individual may start saying that,

168
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,999
“This is not good,” “This is not good.”

169
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:19,879
An individual might take a different attitude about things.

170
00:14:19,999 --> 00:14:24,040
But you must have some symbol of that goodness

171
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,999
placed onto someone.

172
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:35,879
And those symbols were created to symbolize your righteousness,

173
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:40,280
your sense of good, so that you can be saved yourself!

174
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:46,999
Supposing, today, somebody comes and hits you. Alright?

175
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,640
Now you can feel how bad it is

176
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:52,680
to be hit by someone or murdered by someone,

177
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:55,920
so you decide there should be a law protecting you.

178
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,040
But tomorrow you may do the same thing.

179
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,999
So what you do is to take out your goodwill,

180
00:15:04,280 --> 00:15:11,999
represent it as the kingdom or a king or a governing body.

181
00:15:13,999 --> 00:15:18,400
So, the government as it is represents,

182
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:21,999
should represent, also – in both ways.

183
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:23,879
It’s not that it always represents.

184
00:15:23,999 --> 00:15:27,360
It may not at all represent, may not, possibly.

185
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:32,999
But, that the government itself should represent the good in you,

186
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:38,879
the purity in you, the pure will to be good, to be protected.

187
00:15:38,999 --> 00:15:45,440
And that you also should abide by it. It’s a very mutual thing.

188
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,080
But what happens that, once you start electing someone like that,

189
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:52,600
or making someone like that, or appointing someone like that,

190
00:15:52,760 --> 00:15:57,160
as usual, he goes into an ego trip.

191
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:01,560
[It’s] a simple thing like that. It’s absolutely a simple ego trip.

192
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,160
The government gets into an ego trip,

193
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,760
people get amazed how people behave.

194
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:13,040
They’ll elect, supposing, a Prime Minister

195
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,879
and suddenly you find the Prime Minister behaves like a brute

196
00:16:16,999 --> 00:16:19,280
and you can’t understand – “We have elected somebody

197
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:22,360
like a Prime Minister thinking that he will do the good to us.”

198
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,879
You see. It’s possible.

199
00:16:23,999 --> 00:16:29,080
And then the revolutions take place while people revolt, fight it out.

200
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:33,560
Again the will of the people fights it and makes it alright.

201
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:43,800
So we have to have something absolute

202
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,879
because all these values are changing every moment.

203
00:16:48,999 --> 00:16:51,872
Isn’t it? We think that this government did not do so well

204
00:16:51,993 --> 00:16:55,360
– for example, we think like that – so we want to demolish this government.

205
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:58,699
Then we bring another one and we find the same thing happening.

206
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:04,879
See, whether you bring a communist or you bring a socialist

207
00:17:04,999 --> 00:17:09,280
or you bring a democrat or you have a monarchy,

208
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,999
whatever you may have!

209
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:14,800
But still, what happens actually is that,

210
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:20,040
all these things that come up and go away…

211
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,120
(aside: Gavin come here. Can you move forward a little bit so that everybody can be seated?)

212
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:30,999
All these changes that take place

213
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:39,680
go on creating a feeling in a man that we should be anarchist.

214
00:17:39,999 --> 00:17:45,680
Why should we have any government? Why should we have any king?

215
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,960
Why should [we] be ruled by anyone?

216
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:53,999
Because you find the person who’s ruling is not up to the mark

217
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,999
and he is just trying to deceive you.

218
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:03,160
At that point you have to have some absolute standards.

219
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:07,920
If you have an absolute standard then you can always judge

220
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:12,280
that this king is deviating from the right path,

221
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,840
is not doing what a king should do.

222
00:18:15,999 --> 00:18:20,600
A king has to be like Rama. He has to be like Rama.

223
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:25,320
Representing your will, your goodwill,

224
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:33,040
your sense of proper judgement, fair play and righteousness.

225
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:35,360
If the king is not righteous

226
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:41,600
then your collective goodwill will go against the king.

227
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,680
Now you go and throwing one from another.

228
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:46,680
Say, I’ve seen now for example in France:

229
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:51,600
We had one kind of a Prime Minister.

230
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,879
He did lots of things which were not good so he was thrown away.

231
00:18:55,999 --> 00:18:57,879
So you had another one kind of one.

232
00:18:57,999 --> 00:19:00,600
Now he’s doing another thing, so he’s going to be thrown away.

233
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,879
And we are just going, playing games you see.

234
00:19:02,999 --> 00:19:06,040
First of all we have say, Labour Government. We don’t like it.

235
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,680
So then we have another Government, Conservative Government.

236
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:12,640
We don’t like it. Throw it away! Go on playing with it all the time.

237
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,040
But in this relativity we are improving – definitely.

238
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,879
We are more aware, understanding the value of these people,

239
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:25,879
and also the public is understanding.

240
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:34,640
But then when too many such people come in who are negative,

241
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:39,999
they also bring down the will, the collective will, very low.

242
00:19:40,999 --> 00:19:47,920
And people start identifying themselves with these autocrats

243
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:54,840
or those people who are ego-orientated, who have no moral values,

244
00:19:54,999 --> 00:20:05,040
who have no fear of God, who deny religion,

245
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:08,879
who deny evolution

246
00:20:08,999 --> 00:20:13,560
and the Government starts behaving in such a manner

247
00:20:13,680 --> 00:20:15,879
that you are amazed – how this is the Government?

248
00:20:15,999 --> 00:20:19,840
Like in Chile and Argentina, the way the Government is behaving

249
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,389
and is putting down the people.

250
00:20:22,510 --> 00:20:24,838
All these things are happening. You don’t know.

251
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:27,570
It’s such a relative terminology.

252
00:20:27,691 --> 00:20:30,760
Like El Salvador, you don’t know what to do over there now

253
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:33,879
– whom to support. Whether to support the Americans,

254
00:20:33,999 --> 00:20:35,960
or to support the Russians and all that.

255
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:40,999
Now, under these circumstances a Sahaja Yogi can stand and say,

256
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:46,120
“Now, what to do? Should we join this or that?”

257
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:49,400
All is a wasteful thing. It’s just a game going on.

258
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:53,879
Let them break their heads. They are good for nothing. Useless people.

259
00:20:53,999 --> 00:20:56,280
So you cannot solve these problems

260
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,560
and you are not supposed to solve them.

261
00:20:59,680 --> 00:21:04,200
They must get their Realisation and establish the Kingdom of God.

262
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:10,879
So [that] really Rama rules on this Earth

263
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:14,840
and not these horrible kings who change their morality every day,

264
00:21:14,999 --> 00:21:16,879
who change their ideas every day,

265
00:21:16,999 --> 00:21:22,360
those whose will is sometimes for something materialistic.

266
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,440
Like I would say now in our country (UK)

267
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,800
we thought that we’ll have Mrs. Thatcher.

268
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:30,760
Good, very good, she’s coming up well I should say,

269
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,280
certain good things she is saying, like self-restraint and all that,

270
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,360
those things she’s talking good things.

271
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:40,200
But what about herself following this!

272
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:45,040
Shri Rama, not only propounded what was good but he followed that.

273
00:21:45,160 --> 00:21:49,879
He sacrificed for that and he established his own symbol

274
00:21:49,999 --> 00:21:53,879
as a pure symbol of that righteous will,

275
00:21:53,999 --> 00:21:59,040
that is within the people, which is the collective righteous will.

276
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:01,960
Now, for example, you can see clearly

277
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,920
how the ego oriented things work out, first of all,

278
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:07,280
by the misidentifications we can have.

279
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:10,400
Now if you are a communist, you have to be out and out communist!

280
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:13,920
You cannot have compromise between democratic methods and communism.

281
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:16,360
They can’t find any integration.

282
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,200
They think  if you have to be this you have to be absolutely this.

283
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,879
If you have to be that it has to be absolutely that.

284
00:22:21,999 --> 00:22:26,600
But, in Sahaja Yoga, what you find is both are integrated

285
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,640
because you have the complete capital and have now to distribute it.

286
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:37,840
This is a complete integration here.

287
00:22:37,999 --> 00:22:42,200
All these ‘isms’ and all that are experiments of the artificial,

288
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,680
of the mind, just a projection of the mind,

289
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,879
which is, whatever [is] man-made is artificial, you know that.

290
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:50,879
But what is God made is all integrated.

291
00:22:50,999 --> 00:22:57,680
That, whatever you have within yourself, you must give it to others.

292
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:02,680
Now see for administration also, what happens after Sahaja Yoga.

293
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:06,400
Say, I am your Mother, here, sitting down.

294
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:13,760
You like me to guide you. You like me to govern you.

295
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:17,640
You like me to correct you, you like me to scold you

296
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:24,760
and to even go to a great extend to see that your life improves.

297
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,280
Supposing I say, “Alright, I give up. I don’t want to trouble you!”

298
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:31,320
You will not like. None of you will like such a situation

299
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,360
where I say, “Alright you are a gone case,

300
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,320
I have nothing to do. You get out.”

301
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:39,879
Nobody will like such a situation. You want me to govern you.

302
00:23:39,999 --> 00:23:43,080
You want me to look after you. You like that.

303
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,999
Automatically you have started liking it.

304
00:23:47,999 --> 00:23:50,760
There’s no domination, but you want my domination.

305
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,640
You want me to dominate you.

306
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:56,600
You want that all my desire should be dominated – automatically.

307
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,800
Why you feel that, “It is alright, it is very good

308
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:04,800
if Mother takes interest in me, corrects me. It’s a privilege”?

309
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:07,120
Why do you think like that?

310
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:13,880
Because by that there is a general good created.

311
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,879
It’s a general good created in you.

312
00:24:16,999 --> 00:24:19,879
Because you have become integrated.

313
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:29,760
Your body, your mind and your soul, all of them think the same way.

314
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,560
They all want the same. There’s no difference.

315
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,879
Once there is integration

316
00:24:35,999 --> 00:24:38,999
you will find that Sahaja Yoga is the easiest way to live it.

317
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,400
But if there is not, then it is no.

318
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:44,879
For example, if you are a lazy person, say for example,

319
00:24:44,999 --> 00:24:47,440
or you are a very hot-tempered person

320
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:54,999
or you are a sort of a dual person,

321
00:24:55,999 --> 00:25:00,440
or you are playing tricks with yourself, you are playing games,

322
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,999
then you won’t like Sahaja Yoga.

323
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,999
As long as these situations are in you,

324
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:09,640
you will not like Sahaja Yoga.

325
00:25:09,800 --> 00:25:15,440
But once this situation is overcome, then you will like it

326
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:19,879
because then you will know that whatever is good for your Spirit

327
00:25:19,999 --> 00:25:27,280
is for the well-being of you all and of all the people.

328
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,360
Once this well-being comes in,

329
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:35,520
everyone feels absolutely nourished and fresh.

330
00:25:35,999 --> 00:25:43,999
So the governing part is enjoyable.

331
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,879
The correction part is even more enjoyable.

332
00:25:47,999 --> 00:25:52,800
And that you are in the attention of your Mother

333
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:55,120
is such a great feeling within yourself that,

334
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:59,999
“Yes. No, nothing will go wrong with me. She’ll look after me.”

335
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:02,280
“She’s there to look after me.”

336
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:08,680
But this integration part comes very late because of ego problems.

337
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,600
You have built up egos because of

338
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,640
wrong type of people administering you.

339
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:18,040
From your childhood you might have had bad parents

340
00:26:18,160 --> 00:26:21,680
who never talked of God, of good things of life.

341
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,879
They themselves did not lead a life of sacrifice.

342
00:26:24,999 --> 00:26:28,760
Very self indulgent parents can create a problem like that.

343
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,840
They never gave you the right type of life,

344
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:34,879
a proper value system which should have been there.

345
00:26:34,999 --> 00:26:39,879
They never educated how to enjoy righteousness, virtues, in life.

346
00:26:39,999 --> 00:26:43,520
Possibly, later on, the country in which you are born,

347
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,080
the other people who surround you also might have done that.

348
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,879
Also, your government, whichever you have known, must have done that.

349
00:26:51,999 --> 00:26:56,879
So when these things change, when you find that you have achieved

350
00:26:56,999 --> 00:26:59,520
that kind of integration within you:

351
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:04,879
that whatever your body likes is good for your Spirit also.

352
00:27:04,999 --> 00:27:08,879
Like say for example, I don’t like certain things myself.

353
00:27:08,999 --> 00:27:12,520
I don’t like drinks, I don’t like it.

354
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,879
I just don’t like it. Nobody can tempt me.

355
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,879
I mean, no question of temptation, I just don’t like.

356
00:27:17,999 --> 00:27:21,320
I will hate the things which are really bad for my Spirit

357
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:25,160
– automatically. I don’t have to tell myself, it’s just there.

358
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:32,080
To tell lies I don’t like because it harms me there. I don’t like it.

359
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:35,879
Whatever is good for your Spirit will automatically work out

360
00:27:35,999 --> 00:27:38,280
as soon as this integration takes place

361
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,800
and this is the work of Sahaja Yoga today.

362
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,360
That’s why I said it is Krita Yuga, is to be done.

363
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,840
And this integration must be achieved within ourselves.

364
00:27:49,999 --> 00:27:54,600
So sometimes you have to make your body come to this level.

365
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:57,440
Maybe you are under the influence of some bhoots

366
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,999
your body doesn’t help you.

367
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:03,840
Little bit of tapasvita, or penance,

368
00:28:03,999 --> 00:28:06,920
is needed after Sahaja Yoga to make this possible.

369
00:28:07,040 --> 00:28:12,999
And then once you start enjoying it then you like it.

370
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:16,560
Like driving a car – in the beginning it’s difficult.

371
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,879
Or swimming, anything,

372
00:28:17,999 --> 00:28:20,840
when you try to do it’s rather difficult in the beginning.

373
00:28:20,999 --> 00:28:22,760
If I say, “You forget it now, whatever

374
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,879
you have done in the past you forget it now

375
00:28:24,999 --> 00:28:27,200
get to the new things now. You have to do it.”

376
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:34,680
So you have to put your mind to it with all your full zest.

377
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:38,360
That, “Alright, if my body’s not helping me – alright –

378
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,600
then I’ll try to improve the body because I’m not the body.”

379
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:45,879
“If my mind is not helping me, I must improve my mind.

380
00:28:45,999 --> 00:28:51,400
If my intellect is standing in the way

381
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,680
I’ll have to put my intellect right

382
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:56,320
because after all I have to be integrated.

383
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,879
If I am not integrated I’m not going to enjoy anything

384
00:28:59,999 --> 00:29:03,879
nor am I going to do anything good to myself or to others.

385
00:29:03,999 --> 00:29:07,640
So why am I here? Why am I trying to destroy myself?”

386
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,879
But when you are disintegrated, you will be surprised.

387
00:29:10,999 --> 00:29:14,640
your one action will destroy your second action

388
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:18,120
and second action will destroy third action – when you are disintegrated.

389
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:21,080
I’ll give you an example: Supposing now I am sitting here

390
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:25,879
and somebody tells me that this will burn you.

391
00:29:25,999 --> 00:29:31,872
This is my own maya. But the body wants to burn itself.

392
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:35,040
It says, “No, alright, don’t listen to this, just burn itself.”

393
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,560
Now, when I say this it sounds absurd.

394
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:42,880
But, say, the mind says you should not take to alcohol,

395
00:29:43,999 --> 00:29:49,040
but still you’ll go to the pub, then you are disintegrated.

396
00:29:49,999 --> 00:29:52,879
Gradually once you start listening to your body too much,

397
00:29:52,999 --> 00:29:55,879
your mind just gives in. It just gives in.

398
00:29:55,999 --> 00:29:59,040
In every thing that you do, if you are integrated,

399
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:04,160
you will be amazed that you will really become dynamic.

400
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:08,960
Integration is nothing but your complete connection with your Spirit.

401
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:12,280
The Spirit starts flowing into it.

402
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:16,879
In every walk of life you will be amazed how dynamic you’ll become

403
00:30:16,999 --> 00:30:18,880
if you are integrated.

404
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:27,879
Just the connection is to be absolutely achieved with your Spirit.

405
00:30:27,999 --> 00:30:29,680
Whenever you think of something,

406
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,999
“Is it good for my Spirit?”

407
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:39,999
Some people have a habit of thinking that spiritual life is such

408
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:43,640
that you hang by the shoestring somewhere, in the air

409
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,999
and there is no connection to the day to day life.

410
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,879
So many people think like that.

411
00:30:49,999 --> 00:30:53,960
They think such a man should be a thin, miserable creature

412
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:57,760
hanging onto some tree or something

413
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:06,879
and should be absolutely in a paranoid state or something.

414
00:31:06,999 --> 00:31:09,600
That he is frightened of the whole world;

415
00:31:09,760 --> 00:31:11,400
who cannot talk to anyone,

416
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:16,879
who is so much exclusive that he becomes a recluse.

417
00:31:16,999 --> 00:31:20,879
These absurd ideas should to be given up by Sahaja Yogis.

418
00:31:20,999 --> 00:31:26,080
You have to be very much there, absolutely there between all of them.

419
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:28,879
But something: you should be rare, a different type,

420
00:31:28,999 --> 00:31:30,879
a unique personality.

421
00:31:30,999 --> 00:31:34,640
You are to be there with all these things that are going on.

422
00:31:34,800 --> 00:31:38,879
Now people are frightened, you know, even of Sahaja Yogis.

423
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,879
They are frightened of Sahaja Yogis.

424
00:31:40,999 --> 00:31:43,360
[If] they see somebody negative, they [say],

425
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:47,560
“Oh, this thing, that thing.” Now take a fight with that person.

426
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,080
Take a fight. “How could you dare to do this, such a thing?

427
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,999
You are a Sahaja Yogi! Come up! What do you mean by this?”

428
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,080
You have to fight it out.

429
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,400
As long as possible you should try to salvage a person,

430
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,760
talk to him in that manner.

431
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:08,680
The other side of it is that when you talk to others,

432
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:13,879
when they come to you, then there has to be a kind

433
00:32:13,999 --> 00:32:18,920
of a tremendous sincerity within you.

434
00:32:19,816 --> 00:32:21,696
If you are doing with that sincerity

435
00:32:21,817 --> 00:32:24,079
people will know you are doing with sincerity.

436
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:27,640
When you talk to a person they should know there’s sincerity

437
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,360
your heart is there.

438
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,680
For example, you may talk to that person very sweetly,

439
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:36,628
but your heart may not be there and the person might think,

440
00:32:36,749 --> 00:32:38,990
“Oh, he’s just seeking elections.”

441
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:42,600
Alright? But if you talk to someone with the sincerity you’ll say,

442
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:46,879
“How could you do such a thing? Can’t you see yourself?

443
00:32:46,999 --> 00:32:51,160
Can’t you work it out? That’s what it is. You are here for that.”

444
00:32:51,320 --> 00:32:57,840
Now in saying so, your sincerity, which is coming from your heart,

445
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:03,840
is to be seen, and that’s what is Shri Rama’s character is:

446
00:33:03,999 --> 00:33:07,080
that he was on the right side of the heart,

447
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,520
means the heart put to activity.

448
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:16,560
Do you understand that, where Kabira has said,

449
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:22,080
“Mana mamata ko thira kara Lau.”

450
00:33:22,999 --> 00:33:28,840
“I will make my compassion of my heart – mana – from my heart,

451
00:33:28,999 --> 00:33:33,360
the compassion, make it steady. “aur pancha hi tattva milau,”

452
00:33:33,520 --> 00:33:36,760
“and put them into five elements.”

453
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,879
You see, in the same way, when you are in the left heart,

454
00:33:40,999 --> 00:33:44,040
that’s your sincerity. It’s your heart-felt thing.

455
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:46,320
But the heartfelt thing, what’s the use?

456
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:49,080
You see, there are many Sahaja Yogis who really feel,

457
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,040
this world is horrible and something must be done,

458
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,160
Sahaja Yoga must be brought in.

459
00:33:54,320 --> 00:34:00,400
But how many of you are really putting that to action?

460
00:34:02,999 --> 00:34:05,999
Absolutely into action?

461
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:10,999
Without that, your Rama’s tattwa cannot be improved.

462
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:13,960
Rama’s tattwa is only improved when

463
00:34:14,080 --> 00:34:19,520
you put all the things into action that exactly Shri Rama did.

464
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,560
So in the ascent of man, when he came up to Rama’s place,

465
00:34:23,680 --> 00:34:26,920
the advent of Rama was not in the centre, but on the right-hand side.

466
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:32,879
He moved aside. So much so, that he forgot about his past.

467
00:34:32,999 --> 00:34:36,879
He’s never mentioned that He’s an incarnation.

468
00:34:36,999 --> 00:34:39,600
He never told His father. He never told his mother.

469
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,999
He never told anybody that He was an incarnation.

470
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:45,640
Of course it was evident that he was.

471
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,360
His brother knew about it. Now he had two brothers.

472
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,600
Very interesting. I mean he had other brothers also,

473
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:59,600
but Bharat and another was Lakshmana.

474
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:01,640
These two brothers were with him.

475
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:05,080
Now they show the two sides of a human being.

476
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:09,879
One was Lakshmana and he was that fiery type, you see.

477
00:35:09,999 --> 00:35:13,879
He couldn’t bear anybody misbehaving towards Rama.

478
00:35:13,999 --> 00:35:19,879
He couldn’t bear anybody talking in a very mundane type to Shri Rama.

479
00:35:19,999 --> 00:35:23,999
And he used to get so angry with all these people

480
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:28,360
that he would just come out like a big thunderbolt

481
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:33,520
on anybody who tried to say anything about Shri Rama.

482
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:38,040
Even Parashurama, who was there,

483
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,960
a contemporary incarnation of Shri Rama Himself was Parashurama.

484
00:35:42,080 --> 00:35:44,360
It’s a very interesting story about that.

485
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:49,800
But, he could not bare Parashurama in any way…

486
00:35:49,999 --> 00:35:51,999
(break in recording)

487
00:35:54,999 --> 00:35:58,999
…He is the Shesha as they call it.

488
00:35:59,120 --> 00:36:06,040
The serpent which sleeps in the bhavasagara.

489
00:36:06,999 --> 00:36:09,879
On which Shri Vishnu rests.

490
00:36:09,999 --> 00:36:13,440
The same Shesha had taken birth as Shri Lakshmana.

491
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:19,160
Now for a western mind, to them, snakes are sort of…

492
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,560
if you talk about snakes for them, only they know

493
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,560
the Adam and Eve snake that’s all,

494
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,200
they don’t understand anything.

495
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:29,640
And they can’t understand why people worship snakes.

496
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:34,760
You see, snakes are, like cobra and all that, they are like the kings.

497
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,400
They are the kings of the underground.

498
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:44,640
And Shesha is the one who supports the whole Universe.

499
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,879
So this Shesha is worshipped

500
00:36:46,999 --> 00:36:50,920
as the cobras are worshipped in many villages in India, even today,

501
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:53,680
because they don’t trouble anyone there.

502
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:56,520
Because they are like deities, are worshipped in India.

503
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:04,280
And sometimes they do, but mostly they do not bite a good religious man.

504
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:10,520
There’s a story of Sai Nath

505
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,200
where a snake charmer

506
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,560
was given a lot of money just to kill Shri Sai Nath.

507
00:37:22,999 --> 00:37:25,840
And because Sai Nath, used to, in the night,

508
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:30,200
suddenly goes up to his own swing he had made,

509
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:33,400
about thirty feet above the ground.

510
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:36,120
God knows, nobody knew how he used to go there.

511
00:37:36,280 --> 00:37:38,960
But they would find him sleeping up there. (Laughs).

512
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:45,280
So this snake was taken by this snake charmer

513
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:50,120
and he put the snake on to Sai Nath.

514
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:54,400
And the snake went there, and Sai Nath talked to him and He said,

515
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:59,320
“Oh God, you’ve come here to meet me after such a long time.

516
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:00,920
What is your job?”

517
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:04,879
He said, “This horrible snake charmer has asked me to bite you.

518
00:38:04,999 --> 00:38:07,879
So I’ve come to tell you to be careful about these people.”

519
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:12,160
The snake charmer was looking with amazement that he was talking to him!

520
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,680
He said, “Alright, you go now.” He talked to him.

521
00:38:14,811 --> 00:38:16,879
These are age-old snakes, you see.

522
00:38:16,999 --> 00:38:21,440
So the snake went and bit the snake charmer.

523
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:25,800
But then he came down you see, from his thing,

524
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,880
and he sucked his poison and threw it away.

525
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:32,999
“Because, after all, you see,” he said, “the snake is angry with you

526
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:35,480
because you tried such a trick.” So he sucked in.

527
00:38:35,640 --> 00:38:37,879
That’s compassion. That’s compassion.

528
00:38:37,999 --> 00:38:44,840
And he sucked his venom out and the fellow was completely changed

529
00:38:44,999 --> 00:38:48,879
and he said, “Now I’m going to announce it to all the people

530
00:38:48,999 --> 00:38:53,160
what, these brahmins tried to kill,”

531
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:56,359
that they wanted to kill Shri Sai Nath.

532
00:38:56,479 --> 00:38:58,959
And why? Why were they so frightened of this man?

533
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:01,520
He used to live outside the village

534
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:05,840
and they were so frightened of him because they were doing all wrong things

535
00:39:05,999 --> 00:39:09,999
in the name of God. So they were all frightened that they’ll be exposed.

536
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,920
So, this is what it is, that He sleeps on the Shesha.

537
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:19,200
And Shesha is the one who is sometimes expressed in Sahaja Yogis,

538
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:24,879
I have seen, as anger, when you try to be non protocolish

539
00:39:24,999 --> 00:39:29,760
or when you try to be funny or you don’t behave yourself.

540
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,640
That’s the Shesha in them.

541
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,560
That is also sometimes needed.

542
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:35,960
You have to be a Shesha sometimes because

543
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:39,080
otherwise people will start misbehaving

544
00:39:39,200 --> 00:39:41,160
and by that they will be harmed.

545
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:43,879
Not that I will be harmed, but they will be harmed.

546
00:39:43,999 --> 00:39:46,280
So that kind of temperament is also needed.

547
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:51,440
But the other one is very interesting, is that of Bharata, the brother.

548
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:55,640
He showed how Shri Rama bestowed the kingdom to him

549
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:59,960
because of his mother’s agitation.

550
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:05,520
And he didn’t know what to do.

551
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:09,760
So he went back to Rama and he said that, “You take back your kingdom.

552
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:12,800
I don’t want anything. You are the one who should govern.

553
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:14,999
Why should I have it?”

554
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:20,960
So Rama said, “Alright, you just be there in charge of the kingdom.

555
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,280
I have to obey my father, I have to obey my mother

556
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:27,320
because I have given them a promise.”

557
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:34,280
So Shri Rama’s another great quality was once given a promise

558
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,800
is to be kept.

559
00:40:36,999 --> 00:40:39,360
This is another quality we have to have that,

560
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:43,999
if you have promised anything, you have to keep it.

561
00:40:44,999 --> 00:40:47,800
If you have said, “I will do this,”, you must do it.

562
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,200
You should not find out excuses to avoid it.

563
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:54,600
It’s absolutely an anti-God activity to avoid doing

564
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:57,760
things that you have promised.

565
00:40:57,880 --> 00:40:59,800
Your Deities will never be happy.

566
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:03,999
You must see that, whatever you have promised you must do.

567
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:08,879
Now, when Bharata was sent back by Him

568
00:41:08,999 --> 00:41:13,960
he said, “Alright, give me your sandals which I’ll take there.

569
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:19,879
And I’ll use them as if that’s the symbol of you being there.”

570
00:41:19,999 --> 00:41:22,320
And he put those sandals on the throne

571
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,400
and he ruled that kingdom and looked after – Bharata.

572
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,760
Though when he was going to see Rama

573
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,200
then Lakshmana saw him coming and he said, “Look at this!

574
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,879
He’s coming here to invade you now! He has thrown you out of the kingdom

575
00:41:36,999 --> 00:41:38,840
and now he’s coming to invade you.”

576
00:41:38,999 --> 00:41:41,800
So this is also, I’ve seen, among Sahaja Yogis, is there,

577
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:45,640
that the Sahaja Yogis who are like Shesha

578
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,960
cannot see also the goodness of other Sahaja Yogis

579
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:55,080
who are very good people, extremely sacrificing, nice people

580
00:41:55,200 --> 00:42:00,360
but their intentions are not understood, are misunderstood,

581
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,040
which is a very sad thing.

582
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,800
You must see the intentions of another type of people also,

583
00:42:05,920 --> 00:42:08,879
who may not be so hot tempered, may not be so much angry

584
00:42:08,999 --> 00:42:11,520
but their intentions are very good.

585
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:16,999
They have come actually to ask for the sandals of Shri Rama.

586
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:20,520
So among this two type of people, I have seen

587
00:42:20,640 --> 00:42:24,440
there is always a misunderstanding going on.

588
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,520
So both the types of people should try to understand

589
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,640
that we both are needed for Sahaja Yoga.

590
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,879
I cannot only do with one type of people.

591
00:42:33,999 --> 00:42:35,920
We have to have both types of people

592
00:42:36,040 --> 00:42:39,680
who will look after both the styles of the thing.

593
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,840
But when you are dealing with others one should go as one.

594
00:42:44,999 --> 00:42:51,879
For example, if a person is coming to Caxton Hall

595
00:42:51,999 --> 00:42:54,600
and he says something

596
00:42:55,999 --> 00:42:59,879
then you should weigh it whether he’s a new one or an old one.

597
00:42:59,999 --> 00:43:03,920
If he’s a new one then you must show all gentleness, kindness,

598
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:07,280
all kinds of exterior things which will please him.

599
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,480
The reason is: he’s not a realised soul,

600
00:43:09,640 --> 00:43:11,200
he doesn’t see your subtle thing.

601
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:15,879
What he sees is what you are, outside.

602
00:43:15,999 --> 00:43:21,400
How you are dressed, how you talk to them, how you behave towards them.

603
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:24,680
All these things they see first of all.

604
00:43:24,840 --> 00:43:27,879
They don’t see what you have got inside.

605
00:43:27,999 --> 00:43:30,840
They can’t see your heart, they can’t feel your vibrations,

606
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:34,560
so you have to be very kind to them, you have to be very sweet to them.

607
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:38,360
I received a letter from someone saying that “The Sahaja Yogis

608
00:43:38,520 --> 00:43:41,760
have been very, very rude to me and have been angry.”

609
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:45,040
Like the other day, somebody came and was sitting at the back:

610
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:50,200
they are trying to salvage, salvage what you call

611
00:43:50,360 --> 00:43:52,920
the people who are lost by the cults or whatever it is.

612
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:55,999
He was sitting at the back and when I said, “Come forward.”

613
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:58,560
And and he didn’t come so you said, “You get out!”

614
00:43:58,680 --> 00:44:03,320
You should not say! Let me say. That time you should keep quiet.

615
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,879
Nobody should say, “Get out! If you are not going.”

616
00:44:05,999 --> 00:44:11,280
Because the thing is if we say,

617
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,879
“We don’t care for people who are not humble!”

618
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:16,440
Then they are going to be lost in any case.

619
00:44:16,600 --> 00:44:19,120
Let us give them a fair chance.

620
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,320
Let us give them a fair chance to come into Sahaja Yoga;

621
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:23,879
first by your behaviour.

622
00:44:23,999 --> 00:44:28,879
Now, some people have a habit of, sort of talking to them

623
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:33,160
a bit too much. They should not talk. That’s one thing I feel,

624
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,520
that, while giving vibrations and all that,

625
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:44,160
at the most you should ask, “Are you feeling any cool breeze?”

626
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:48,720
in a very humble way. And this is another quality of Shri Rama,

627
00:44:48,840 --> 00:44:52,560
is a sankoch. There’s no word in English language

628
00:44:52,720 --> 00:44:54,520
because you have ‘formality’

629
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:58,079
which is a very insipid word to describe ‘ ‘sankoch’.

630
00:44:58,199 --> 00:45:01,800
Because, there is no integration between your heart and formality.

631
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:04,640
But if you can think of a ‘formality of the heart’

632
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:07,640
then what do you call that?

633
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,199
What will you call in English language?

634
00:45:15,199 --> 00:45:18,240
The formality of the heart.

635
00:45:18,360 --> 00:45:20,480
Yogini: Sincerity.

636
00:45:20,600 --> 00:45:25,199
Shri Mataji: No, sincerity is different. It’s an action.

637
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:31,079
Sincerity is an abstract thing. But formality, from the heart.

638
00:45:31,199 --> 00:45:35,199
You see, how to say such a thing?

639
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:39,199
Yogini: ‘Honestly’ Mother. ‘Honestly’.

640
00:45:41,640 --> 00:45:46,079
Shri Mataji: No, no. Not ‘honesty’. These are all abstract words.

641
00:45:46,199 --> 00:45:48,079
In action.

642
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:51,079
You see, say for example, now, I am sitting.

643
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:54,199
Now if they bring me a cup, alright?

644
00:45:54,320 --> 00:45:57,079
It’s a broken cup, for example, you go to somebody’s house,

645
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:59,000
and it’s a little broken.

646
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:02,800
So, if an Indian is there -I don’t know about Western style

647
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,720
– he will drink it off.

648
00:46:04,840 --> 00:46:07,320
He will not say anything, “It’s broken,” or anything.

649
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,800
But maybe somebody might say, “It’s a broken cup!”

650
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:16,560
Or say, you go to somebody’s house

651
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,040
and you don’t like a colour scheme or something.

652
00:46:22,199 --> 00:46:27,079
So for an Indian person it would be not proper

653
00:46:27,199 --> 00:46:33,360
to immediately say like that – for an Indian person.

654
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:36,840
You see, “formality of the heart”.

655
00:46:37,000 --> 00:46:42,199
Not to say something in such a way that

656
00:46:43,840 --> 00:46:49,600
you touch the wrong side of the person is sankoch.

657
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:54,560
Now to such an extent Shri Rama had that there’s a good story

658
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,079
– I think I had said it before also, but again I’ll repeat it to you –

659
00:46:58,199 --> 00:47:02,560
which is described in another Ramayana written by Tulsidasa.

660
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:05,079
Although Tulsidasa was not a Realised soul,

661
00:47:05,199 --> 00:47:08,000
but some points he has brought out very well.

662
00:47:08,120 --> 00:47:09,079
He says that:

663
00:47:09,199 --> 00:47:19,400
Shri Rama was putting the arrows

664
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,400
against the heads of Ravana.

665
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:30,040
And he had ten heads. And he had a boon that,

666
00:47:30,199 --> 00:47:33,079
every head that falls off, another head will come up.

667
00:47:33,199 --> 00:47:35,800
He had a boon like that. So his brother says,

668
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,520
“What are you doing? You know that he cannot die

669
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:42,880
by putting the arrows across his head.

670
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:45,880
You have to put it in his heart otherwise he will not die.”

671
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:49,079
So the sankocha comes in Him and He said,

672
00:47:49,199 --> 00:47:52,960
“See, in his heart he has got my wife

673
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,840
because he loves Her and She’s sitting in his heart.

674
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,840
How can I hit him in the heart? She’ll be hurt.”

675
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:03,120
See the delicacy of his understanding.

676
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:07,240
So he said, “Then by hitting his head is he going to be killed?”

677
00:48:07,360 --> 00:48:12,079
He said, “You see, attention, once it going towards his head,

678
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:15,199
his attention will be withdrawn from his heart.

679
00:48:15,388 --> 00:48:17,190
And once the attention is withdrawn,

680
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,520
my wife will not be there any more,

681
00:48:19,640 --> 00:48:23,120
then Ill hit him and I’ll kill him.”

682
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:27,040
So see, the sankoch! You see, then you will understand that

683
00:48:27,199 --> 00:48:30,000
how we are rude and arrogant.

684
00:48:32,199 --> 00:48:40,280
This kind of arrogance and rudeness comes to us because we have no sankoch.

685
00:48:41,420 --> 00:48:44,979
We should not say everything to everyone. We need not.

686
00:48:45,099 --> 00:48:49,525
Should we say everything? Say, for example, in your puja

687
00:48:49,646 --> 00:48:52,566
maybe you are doing something which should not be done.

688
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:55,620
I know it’s wrong. Unless and until it’s absolutely wrong,

689
00:48:55,740 --> 00:48:57,979
I will not tell. I said, “Gradually they will learn.”

690
00:48:58,099 --> 00:49:01,020
Because otherwise you become like this, you see, tensed up.

691
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:07,420
You must see Linda’s face if I tell her anything! She goes into…

692
00:49:07,899 --> 00:49:13,740
So that sankocha, that understanding comes if you love someone

693
00:49:13,899 --> 00:49:16,899
and understand. Now, you have to love all the seekers of the world.

694
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,779
They have done wrong, they have done all kinds of ego-trips,

695
00:49:19,899 --> 00:49:22,899
they have done all kinds of mistakes but your Mother loves them

696
00:49:23,020 --> 00:49:25,420
and you have to love them.

697
00:49:25,899 --> 00:49:28,940
If they are to be corrected I’ll do that.

698
00:49:29,060 --> 00:49:31,779
You just don’t do that way that they feel hurt.

699
00:49:31,899 --> 00:49:34,100
Put a sankocha.

700
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:37,779
While talking to each other educate yourself,

701
00:49:37,899 --> 00:49:43,899
train yourself to say things which are sweet and nice,

702
00:49:44,899 --> 00:49:48,779
which will make another person feel

703
00:49:48,899 --> 00:49:53,779
that this person is a properly brought up person

704
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:55,340
in Sahaja Yoga tradition.

705
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:57,779
So we have a Sahaja Yoga tradition also,

706
00:49:57,899 --> 00:50:00,420
in which, when we speak to each other,

707
00:50:00,540 --> 00:50:04,100
we have that sankocha within us of Shri Rama.

708
00:50:04,260 --> 00:50:06,260
And if you do not have that sankocha

709
00:50:06,420 --> 00:50:08,779
you get the Right Heart.

710
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:14,420
And that Right Heart is a very dangerous thing in a country like England,

711
00:50:14,540 --> 00:50:16,220
where the climate is so bad,

712
00:50:16,340 --> 00:50:21,700
because it gives you a horrible thing like asthma.

713
00:50:22,220 --> 00:50:26,060
I’m not frightening you, but it’s true.

714
00:50:26,220 --> 00:50:29,779
You get asthma if your Right Heart is caught.

715
00:50:29,899 --> 00:50:32,460
Not necessarily that asthma comes from Right Heart only

716
00:50:32,580 --> 00:50:34,309
– can also come from centre heart –

717
00:50:34,430 --> 00:50:38,779
but [if] you get Right Heart you definitely get asthma.

718
00:50:38,899 --> 00:50:42,500
So the attitude you see, like your father.

719
00:50:42,660 --> 00:50:46,100
I’ve heard people talking to father also in such a funny way.

720
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:48,660
You can’t talk to your father like that.

721
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:50,420
They talk to me also very rudely.

722
00:50:50,540 --> 00:50:54,540
I mean, I have seen people, Sahaja Yogis, shockingly sometimes

723
00:50:54,700 --> 00:51:00,340
– on a very mundane level or you can say in a very unprotocolish way.

724
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,500
you will get into Right Heart.

725
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,060
So this sankoch one has to learn,

726
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:10,180
the maryada: means the boundaries of your relationships.

727
00:51:10,301 --> 00:51:12,580
You see, “we love each other,” doesn’t mean

728
00:51:12,740 --> 00:51:17,779
that we go on aggressing other’s privacies.

729
00:51:17,899 --> 00:51:21,260
To what extent you love each other doesn’t mean

730
00:51:21,420 --> 00:51:25,180
that you go on in way that you try to transgress

731
00:51:25,300 --> 00:51:30,580
all the beauties and all the privacies of another person.

732
00:51:30,899 --> 00:51:33,860
You see, [if] someone walks into the bedroom directly

733
00:51:33,980 --> 00:51:37,180
is not the way Sahaja Yoga should be. I need not tell.

734
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:38,860
But you must knock if you have to.

735
00:51:38,980 --> 00:51:40,779
And knock at a time when you need it!

736
00:51:40,899 --> 00:51:45,980
All the time to knock or to hang onto someone all the time is not proper.

737
00:51:46,100 --> 00:51:50,220
The sankocha is a complete cultural stuff.

738
00:51:50,340 --> 00:51:57,660
So we have a cultural tradition which we have to learn from Shri Ram.

739
00:51:57,780 --> 00:52:01,340
He’s known for his sankocha. Every time, how to say this,

740
00:52:01,500 --> 00:52:07,340
I cannot say that. We have this very much engrained within us.

741
00:52:09,780 --> 00:52:12,540
The children are to be educated in that way,

742
00:52:12,661 --> 00:52:17,061
and once they are educated that way they will learn the sankoch,

743
00:52:17,260 --> 00:52:24,220
and that will give them a proper understanding of social life.

744
00:52:24,340 --> 00:52:28,740
Like you now see, this light is here: if you put your finger to it,

745
00:52:28,899 --> 00:52:31,020
it might burn and you may remove your finger.

746
00:52:31,141 --> 00:52:33,540
But if you are with another person

747
00:52:33,660 --> 00:52:35,940
and if you try to take liberties with that person

748
00:52:36,060 --> 00:52:39,580
a day may come when that person will misbehave

749
00:52:39,740 --> 00:52:43,340
or will harm you or do something to you. But still you will not realise

750
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:47,580
[that] it is because you have no sankoch [that] it has happened.

751
00:52:47,740 --> 00:52:52,779
So this sankoch has to be worked out very beautifully in every way:

752
00:52:52,899 --> 00:52:56,980
in thanks-giving, in accepting some body’s gratitude,

753
00:52:57,100 --> 00:53:00,260
in expressing your love to another person

754
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,820
– in a way that is a sankoch.

755
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:10,260
Now Shri Rama is known for his boundaries.

756
00:53:10,780 --> 00:53:15,220
He doesn’t cross the limit. Yesterday, the other day I told you about

757
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:18,580
food, that you don’t cross the boundaries of food,

758
00:53:18,740 --> 00:53:23,020
like being compassionate to the bugs and to the mosquitoes.

759
00:53:23,180 --> 00:53:29,779
In the same way in every thing discretion of the heart should be there.

760
00:53:29,899 --> 00:53:34,180
Now, there is no word for “discretion of the heart”

761
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:37,460
in the English language, which is maryada.

762
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:47,420
Discretion of the heart is, to understand, say, example,

763
00:53:47,540 --> 00:53:50,540
that if you are rude to your father what do you gain?

764
00:53:50,700 --> 00:53:54,180
You gain nothing. But if you are humble you might gain over,

765
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:58,779
with your father alright. Even if he’s a bad man!

766
00:53:58,899 --> 00:54:02,779
Because what happens in reaction, if you say psychologically:

767
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:07,779
Supposing you are the son of a father who is doing something wrong

768
00:54:07,899 --> 00:54:10,779
and you are obedient to him,

769
00:54:10,899 --> 00:54:15,980
he will always have a fear that he will lose you if he falls in your ideals.

770
00:54:16,820 --> 00:54:21,060
So by that humility you will raise him.

771
00:54:25,060 --> 00:54:27,940
If you are humble, if your behaviour towards your parents

772
00:54:28,060 --> 00:54:31,060
is like Shri Rama’s, there’s nothing to lose.

773
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,779
You don’t compromise in your principles or anything.

774
00:54:34,899 --> 00:54:38,220
In day to day things, like that, [if] your father is sitting…

775
00:54:38,340 --> 00:54:40,340
I mean in India if the father is there,

776
00:54:40,500 --> 00:54:44,047
you won’t sit down before him, you won’t sit, at any cost.

777
00:54:44,168 --> 00:54:47,101
Till he tells you ten times, you won’t sit before him.

778
00:54:47,222 --> 00:54:50,779
It helps, you know. Then it reacts on the father

779
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:54,980
that,  “Supposing I misbehave much my son will not respect me.”

780
00:54:56,220 --> 00:54:59,899
So the sense of respect also comes from your heart.

781
00:55:00,020 --> 00:55:07,260
That’s only possible if you know that maryada from your heart

782
00:55:07,420 --> 00:55:10,779
how far to go. What is the need to be rude to your father?

783
00:55:10,899 --> 00:55:14,740
No need at all, at any cost! What is the need?

784
00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:17,220
Or to your husband or to your wife?

785
00:55:17,340 --> 00:55:19,899
Why to say anything harsh to anyone? What is the need?

786
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:22,300
What are you going to gain out of it?

787
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:25,420
By saying anything harsh I have not seen people have improved.

788
00:55:25,540 --> 00:55:29,580
Only when a guru is harsh or,

789
00:55:29,740 --> 00:55:32,899
I mean, the mother or father are harsh to the children it helps.

790
00:55:33,020 --> 00:55:36,700
Nowhere else it helps you in common relationships.

791
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:42,100
Like brothers and sisters, it does not, and higher and lower.

792
00:55:42,260 --> 00:55:45,340
The lower person have to bear the harshness of the elders

793
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:47,428
if they want to improve. There’s nothing!

794
00:55:47,549 --> 00:55:49,990
After all they’re not going to throttle you.

795
00:55:50,111 --> 00:55:53,220
Supposing even if he says something bad to you – doesn’t matter.

796
00:55:53,340 --> 00:55:55,779
You try to. And there, what one has to remember [is]

797
00:55:55,899 --> 00:55:59,899
what Christ has said that, you must put another cheek.

798
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:05,020
So use the heart’s discretion – how far to go to a person.

799
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:10,260
In the effect of it you will be a very, very powerful person,

800
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:14,740
in your family, in Sahaja Yoga, anywhere.

801
00:56:14,899 --> 00:56:19,860
Those people who are obedient to me are very powerful Sahaja Yogis.

802
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:21,899
You know that.

803
00:56:22,899 --> 00:56:26,460
And those who are not go down very fast.

804
00:56:26,580 --> 00:56:30,779
I try to save them, by everything, but I have seen

805
00:56:30,899 --> 00:56:34,300
– those who are disobedient, who don’t listen to me,

806
00:56:34,460 --> 00:56:37,420
who are rude to me, who do not understand the protocol,

807
00:56:37,540 --> 00:56:39,500
go down very much in Sahaja Yoga.

808
00:56:39,660 --> 00:56:41,779
Absolutely (clicking fingers) like that!

809
00:56:41,899 --> 00:56:48,460
In a second I find they are going hundreds of feet down. It’s true.

810
00:56:48,820 --> 00:56:52,779
Because what is lacking in you is the discretion, the maryada

811
00:56:52,899 --> 00:56:56,500
– how far to go. And that’s another thing we have to learn

812
00:56:56,660 --> 00:56:58,180
to educate ourselves.

813
00:56:58,300 --> 00:57:02,340
So the education of Shri Rama as it was, I told you, that

814
00:57:02,500 --> 00:57:05,779
he could kill a demon with one arrow.

815
00:57:05,899 --> 00:57:09,100
You don’t have to beat them a hundred and eight times,

816
00:57:09,260 --> 00:57:11,899
one beating should be sufficient.

817
00:57:13,780 --> 00:57:15,740
But you have to be powerful people

818
00:57:15,899 --> 00:57:20,220
and the power of a person increases by putting maryada.

819
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:24,779
Supposing you have wheat, and you just spread it,

820
00:57:24,899 --> 00:57:28,779
it will spread all over, anybody will, birds will come and eat it off,

821
00:57:28,899 --> 00:57:32,660
it will be finished. But if you put them in a sack

822
00:57:32,780 --> 00:57:39,420
it will have a weight, it will have a size, it will rise in height

823
00:57:39,540 --> 00:57:42,860
and it is useful. It will have respect.

824
00:57:42,980 --> 00:57:46,820
But the thing that is all spread all over, which has no maryada,

825
00:57:46,940 --> 00:57:48,779
will never be respected.

826
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:54,740
Nothing works out without maryada. Even the light keeps to a maryada.

827
00:57:54,899 --> 00:57:59,820
You have to keep your maryadas. That is part of our training, you see.

828
00:57:59,940 --> 00:58:02,980
Say, for example, an aeroplane is there

829
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:05,820
and it is not bound by any maryadas.

830
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,940
You see, it is not bound. When it goes in the air

831
00:58:09,060 --> 00:58:10,899
it will be all finished!

832
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:17,660
All our ideas of freedom are to be bound by maryada.

833
00:58:17,780 --> 00:58:21,340
If the freedom has no maryada it is abandonment,

834
00:58:21,500 --> 00:58:25,020
it is nonsense, it is not going to help us.

835
00:58:25,660 --> 00:58:29,779
So we have to create out of Sahaja Yogis great politicians.

836
00:58:29,899 --> 00:58:34,940
It has been predicted that if Sahaja Yoga does not spread

837
00:58:35,060 --> 00:58:38,300
then the third world war is inevitable.

838
00:58:38,460 --> 00:58:41,740
People will suffer a lot with a third world war.

839
00:58:41,899 --> 00:58:48,260
It is possible to avoid it if people take to Sahaja Yoga in a big number.

840
00:58:48,420 --> 00:58:51,700
But if they do not, there will be a third world war

841
00:58:51,820 --> 00:58:54,779
and the effects of that will harm people so much

842
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:59,020
that ultimately it is the Sahaja Yogis who will be called for a conference

843
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:01,300
and not the diplomats.

844
00:59:01,460 --> 00:59:03,540
The Sahaja Yogis will be consulted,

845
00:59:03,700 --> 00:59:06,380
and they will decide what is to be done for the world

846
00:59:06,540 --> 00:59:10,779
and they will become the rulers of tomorrow’s world.

847
00:59:10,899 --> 00:59:16,180
So we must have a full idea [of] how to be rulers like Shri Rama.

848
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:20,740
We have to go too far with ourselves, to training up ourselves,

849
00:59:20,899 --> 00:59:23,860
educating ourselves, getting rid of our egos

850
00:59:23,980 --> 00:59:27,180
and understanding that we have to grow.

851
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:31,779
It’s a very big task, it’s a great task and sometimes you might think,

852
00:59:31,899 --> 00:59:34,340
“How can Mother expect us to do it?”

853
00:59:34,460 --> 00:59:37,020
But I think you are the people who are chosen for it

854
00:59:37,180 --> 00:59:39,580
and you have to get to it and work it out.

855
00:59:39,740 --> 00:59:43,779
So we have to train up ourselves to be first good rulers of ourselves

856
00:59:43,899 --> 00:59:45,779
and the rulers of others.

857
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:48,198
First we must learn to rule ourselves. You see,

858
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:53,020
here in this body only you’ll learn how to rule yourself.

859
00:59:53,180 --> 00:59:55,980
Comfort, if you get fond of comfort,

860
00:59:56,100 --> 01:00:00,899
make your body work it out that there’s no comfort needed.

861
01:00:01,260 --> 01:00:04,020
If your body indulges into too much eating or anything,

862
01:00:04,180 --> 01:00:08,540
make your body learn that it’s not good to indulge into it.

863
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:11,340
If you speak too much, talk too much, if you are rude,

864
01:00:11,460 --> 01:00:14,779
just say that, “I’m not going to say a word from morning till evening.”

865
01:00:14,899 --> 01:00:19,660
Take to mauna (silence). So the tapah, is the penance time,

866
01:00:19,820 --> 01:00:21,220
is now ahead of us.

867
01:00:21,340 --> 01:00:25,820
With that penance, the greatest thing that is going to help you

868
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:32,460
is to go and talk of Sahaja Yoga – give the message of my advent –

869
01:00:32,580 --> 01:00:37,300
and also talk about how the transformation, the blossom time has come.

870
01:00:37,460 --> 01:00:42,260
This you have to do, plus you have to learn how to rule yourself

871
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:46,427
and then how to rule others through your heart, not through your mind.

872
01:00:46,548 --> 01:00:49,933
You have to rule through your hearts by learning all the qualities

873
01:00:50,054 --> 01:00:52,540
of the heart which I have told you.

874
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:56,420
And I must congratulate you for the article you have written on Blossom Time.

875
01:00:56,540 --> 01:00:59,340
I have gone through it. I have really enjoyed it, thoroughly.

876
01:00:59,500 --> 01:01:01,460
He’s done very well. May God bless you!

877
01:01:01,580 --> 01:01:03,660
And I think it will have a good [effect]…

878
01:01:03,780 --> 01:01:05,500
I’m surprised how they published it:

879
01:01:05,660 --> 01:01:08,580
have they changed their mind or what happened?

880
01:01:08,740 --> 01:01:11,779
It’s amazing! Have you seen that article?

881
01:01:11,899 --> 01:01:13,500
It’s great.

882
01:01:17,899 --> 01:01:23,060
And thank you very much for the nice creepers you have sent me.

883
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:26,779
They are so beautiful you see, they still are under a shock

884
01:01:26,899 --> 01:01:30,300
because I removed them from your gentle care to mine.

885
01:01:30,460 --> 01:01:32,980
And mine is a little sort of flippant one now.

886
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:35,260
But today we tried to do some justice to them.

887
01:01:35,420 --> 01:01:39,060
I’m sure they’ll. We gave them a bandhan.

888
01:01:42,780 --> 01:01:45,300
Shri Mataji: You mean you want to be more intelligent?

889
01:01:45,420 --> 01:01:47,779
Yogi: No, to get rid of the rubbish Mother.

890
01:01:47,899 --> 01:01:50,300
Shri Mataji: Rubbish that is in the head?

891
01:01:50,460 --> 01:01:52,740
You see, the best one, in Sanskrit it is said,

892
01:01:52,899 --> 01:01:55,779
“Ya neti neti wachane nigamor avochus.”

893
01:01:55,899 --> 01:02:00,020
means, you go on telling your mind, “This is not, this is not, this is not.”

894
01:02:00,180 --> 01:02:02,860
Any thought that comes to your mind, you go on telling,

895
01:02:02,980 --> 01:02:06,940
“this is not the thought. Not this, not this, not this.”

896
01:02:08,740 --> 01:02:11,220
Then the inspiration starts coming.

897
01:02:11,340 --> 01:02:15,020
You see, what I feel, people are not inspired.

898
01:02:15,660 --> 01:02:18,060
They have got fear on one side.

899
01:02:18,220 --> 01:02:21,779
Suddenly, you do something to them they go into a fear, a trauma.

900
01:02:21,899 --> 01:02:27,100
Or else, if you try to be good to them, they go into an ego-trip.

901
01:02:27,260 --> 01:02:29,779
So to stay in the centre, what you have to do,

902
01:02:29,899 --> 01:02:32,779
is to go on saying “Not this thought,” and, “not this thought.”

903
01:02:32,899 --> 01:02:36,220
Then you will be a deep Sahaja Yogi.

904
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:39,779
Best is this. Because intellect is nothing – so-called intellect.

905
01:02:39,899 --> 01:02:45,540
Only God has intelligence, nobody has! To be very frank.

906
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:52,700
It’s a big joke, isn’t it?

907
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:56,420
Every one thinks they are intelligent but they are not, they are stupid.

908
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:59,899
You see, all stupidity is considered as intelligence these days.

909
01:03:00,020 --> 01:03:03,779
For example, cunningness – it never pays you dividends.

910
01:03:03,899 --> 01:03:08,100
What is intellect? Is the only understanding of intellect

911
01:03:08,260 --> 01:03:13,580
as Adi Shankaracharya had put it –

912
01:03:13,740 --> 01:03:15,500
“Na yoge, na sankhya,”

913
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,779
All these things are good for nothing.

914
01:03:17,899 --> 01:03:22,180
Only service to your Mother is the best way.

915
01:03:22,300 --> 01:03:26,700
Ask your intellect, “Is it serving my Mother?”

916
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:31,660
Intellect will tell you, the so-called intellect of human beings,

917
01:03:31,780 --> 01:03:36,740
to cheat yourself. It cheats you. It gives you escapes. It cheats you.

918
01:03:36,899 --> 01:03:39,340
All the time the intellect is working by saying,

919
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,779
“This may be good, that may be good” you see,

920
01:03:42,899 --> 01:03:45,820
but the real good, it never sees.

921
01:03:45,940 --> 01:03:49,260
It’s a trick of the ego, trick of the ego.

922
01:03:49,420 --> 01:03:52,779
Is the choices. Ego likes choices, you see.

923
01:03:52,899 --> 01:03:56,779
So, “This is good, this is bad, this I don’t like this, this.”

924
01:03:56,899 --> 01:03:59,660
All ‘I’ business should be given up and say that,

925
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:01,899
“Not this, not this, not this.”

926
01:04:03,740 --> 01:04:08,540
“We” should come in, “we”, not “I”.

927
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:13,340
Now you are not anymore ‘I’s, you are ‘we’ now.

928
01:04:16,780 --> 01:04:18,700
That’s how the intellect will go away.

929
01:04:18,860 --> 01:04:21,500
Because this intellect has gathered all kind of nonsense

930
01:04:21,620 --> 01:04:23,820
and it doesn’t exist! That’s the biggest maya!

931
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:27,700
It doesn’t exist! There is no intelligence at all!

932
01:04:27,820 --> 01:04:30,500
What is the intelligence, is just to understand

933
01:04:30,660 --> 01:04:36,460
that there is nothing like this intellect – you are nothing.

934
01:04:36,660 --> 01:04:39,580
You see, to explain His intellect would be something

935
01:04:39,740 --> 01:04:42,060
like explaining human civilisation to an ant!

936
01:04:42,220 --> 01:04:47,300
Even that is easier! It’s like that – His intellect.

937
01:04:51,460 --> 01:04:59,899
And He’s innocent. So simple. I mean, anybody is amazed how can that be.

938
01:05:00,780 --> 01:05:07,100
So the most intelligent person is the one who knows

939
01:05:07,260 --> 01:05:12,660
that our intellect is just a ego-trip.

940
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,780
This is the sign of pure intelligence,

941
01:05:20,940 --> 01:05:26,779
is the sign of pure understanding

942
01:05:26,899 --> 01:05:32,860
that the heart is the ruler, there resides the Spirit

943
01:05:32,980 --> 01:05:37,220
which is the most intelligent thing within us.

944
01:05:37,340 --> 01:05:42,420
And the inspiration of the Spirit is the manifestation

945
01:05:42,540 --> 01:05:45,899
of the pure intellect of God.

946
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:52,899
And what I told you today is the intellect of the heart.

947
01:05:54,660 --> 01:05:58,580
But of the brain – zero!

948
01:06:01,899 --> 01:06:04,420
But then, what’s the use of the brain?

949
01:06:04,540 --> 01:06:08,300
Why have brain? Why not only have heart? It would be alright.

950
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:11,860
But the brain is the one which acts.

951
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:16,260
Heart gives the inspiration but the brain acts on it,

952
01:06:16,420 --> 01:06:18,220
it’s communicating.

953
01:06:19,899 --> 01:06:23,460
But the inspiration, the source, is the heart, is the Spirit.

954
01:06:23,580 --> 01:06:26,899
Again connect yourself to the Spirit.

955
01:06:30,796 --> 01:06:38,717
Intelligently, how will you explain Kundalini awakening?

956
01:06:38,899 --> 01:06:42,260
Leave alone Kundalini, how can you explain sprouting of the seed

957
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:45,980
intelligently, through your intellect?

958
01:06:46,100 --> 01:06:55,899
Explain, means, explain why, how.

959
01:06:56,020 --> 01:06:58,779
Sprouting of the seed, a simple thing

960
01:06:58,899 --> 01:07:01,899
which you see thousand and one times.

961
01:07:03,460 --> 01:07:10,180
How will you explain? Intellect is that says, “I cannot explain.”

962
01:07:11,899 --> 01:07:16,899
A very limited thing. It’s ego, nothing but ego.

963
01:07:20,580 --> 01:07:25,740
And once you get rid of it then the pure intellect starts coming in.

964
01:07:25,899 --> 01:07:29,779
You see, with [Mr.] Yoga Singh, you will be amazed, you see, who is,

965
01:07:29,899 --> 01:07:33,580
I mean he came to us as a bhoot absolutely. He’s so much changed.

966
01:07:33,740 --> 01:07:36,779
Now he speaks, I tell you, he speaks like a saint.

967
01:07:36,899 --> 01:07:38,940
I was amazed!

968
01:07:41,180 --> 01:07:44,060
He speaks so well sometimes that I want to quote him sometimes

969
01:07:44,220 --> 01:07:46,420
– the way he speaks about certain things.

970
01:07:46,540 --> 01:07:50,540
I am amazed how he has started talking like that.

971
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,779
So whatever you have to say relate it to the Spirit

972
01:07:57,899 --> 01:07:59,860
you will talk like saints.

973
01:07:59,980 --> 01:08:03,540
Relate it to Spirit, not to anything else,

974
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:07,060
relate it to Spirit and you will be amazed.

975
01:08:13,540 --> 01:08:18,779
He told me that, “There are many people in this world who are absurd.”

976
01:08:18,899 --> 01:08:20,580
I said, “How do you know?”

977
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:24,899
He says “Because they don’t want to know anything about you.

978
01:08:27,220 --> 01:08:31,940
I don’t know why are they here and why have you created them!”

979
01:08:34,300 --> 01:08:38,540
You see, he was a person with so many bhoots on his head.

980
01:08:42,980 --> 01:08:45,779
He’s such a beautiful man, I tell you.

981
01:08:45,899 --> 01:08:48,220
He says this, “This is your servant is alright,

982
01:08:48,340 --> 01:08:52,779
but he has to learn certain things if he has to live well.

983
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:57,700
He doesn’t have neatness. Because his mind is not neat.

984
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:03,899
He has to be a cleaner person. But his mind is not clean.

985
01:09:04,020 --> 01:09:08,899
His heart is alright. But the mind should be clean.”

986
01:09:09,899 --> 01:09:11,899
I was amazed at him.

987
01:09:13,260 --> 01:09:17,580
He’s not an educated man or anything, just an ordinary person.

988
01:09:17,740 --> 01:09:20,060
But they start talking like prophets.

989
01:09:20,180 --> 01:09:22,380
I think you’d better read some of the prophets

990
01:09:22,540 --> 01:09:25,300
you will also start talking like them.

991
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:29,940
You read Kabir, Khalil Gibran, all these people.

992
01:09:30,060 --> 01:09:33,700
What is Blake? He was a prophet too.

993
01:09:34,980 --> 01:09:38,220
You can talk like him. Why not?

994
01:09:38,899 --> 01:09:43,340
He talked through his Spirit isn’t it? Pure intelligence.

995
01:09:44,899 --> 01:09:48,899
Then you’ll become Shri Rama if you can do that.

996
01:09:50,899 --> 01:09:54,779
So today’s a great day. I’m happy you all could come.

997
01:09:54,899 --> 01:09:58,660
And it has worked out so well that this is,

998
01:09:58,780 --> 01:10:03,460
I was going to come here and talk about Shri Rama

999
01:10:03,580 --> 01:10:08,899
and wish you all that you follow Him up.

1000
01:10:09,340 --> 01:10:10,779
Respect yourself!

1001
01:10:10,899 --> 01:10:15,660
And it’s your responsibility to be good, to be like that,

1002
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,899
to work it out that way.

1003
01:10:19,899 --> 01:10:21,940
May God bless you.

1004
01:10:39,899 --> 01:10:44,740
Alright.  You wanted to do a small, little puja? You can wash my feet.

1005
