H.H. Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi
Press-Conference

00:20.190 --> 00:36.920
London, England, July 8, 1999

03:42.769 --> 03:49.079
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

03:49.791 --> 03:55.891
First of all, it’s important to know what
the truth is.

03:56.911 --> 04:03.760
You find so many people are seeking the truth,
but they don’t know what to find and that’s

04:03.810 --> 04:11.080
how they are twisted around, taken to some
sort of a false rites.

04:11.080 --> 04:17.150
It’s important first of all to know what
is the truth that we are seeking.

04:17.150 --> 04:30.410
The truth is, if I tell you, it’s very simple:
that you are not this body, you are not this

04:30.410 --> 04:41.690
mind, you are not this intellect, you are
not these emotions, but you are the pure Spirit.

04:41.690 --> 04:47.370
That’s what you have to become – the pure
Spirit.

04:47.370 --> 04:59.209
And another truth is that the power that leads
you to the state were you know the truth about

04:59.209 --> 05:07.000
yourself, about everything is within you,
this power is within you, is your own.

05:07.000 --> 05:11.510
Born with you, with every human being.

05:11.510 --> 05:18.049
That’s surprising: if all the human beings
in the whole world have this power within

05:18.049 --> 05:21.679
their triangular bone - how can we differentiate
them?

05:21.679 --> 05:27.390
They are all just the same, everybody has
a power based in their triangular bone known

05:27.390 --> 05:35.220
as sacrum, that means the Greeks knew it was
a sacred bone.

05:35.220 --> 05:43.239
This fact that there is a power in the triangular
bone was known thousands of years back, I

05:43.239 --> 05:47.519
should say, in India and in various countries.

05:47.519 --> 05:51.390
I was surprised – even in Sweden I found,
Norway I found, people were talking about.

05:51.390 --> 05:57.560
I don’t know how they came to know about.

05:57.560 --> 06:03.939
Specially Moscow I found people who knew about
it.

06:03.939 --> 06:05.799
“How do you know?”

06:05.799 --> 06:06.829
I asked them.

06:06.829 --> 06:08.709
They said: “Our forefathers told us”,
like that.

06:08.709 --> 06:17.679
Specially with Indian Americans they are very,
very down-to-earth people, very natural people,

06:17.679 --> 06:20.060
I think – they also knew about it.

06:20.060 --> 06:23.090
And Africans also knew about it.

06:23.090 --> 06:29.429
But they didn’t know how to raise it.

06:29.429 --> 06:32.029
That was the only problem they had.

06:32.029 --> 06:38.799
And though they knew about the centres, about
which just now you have been told, they didn’t

06:38.799 --> 06:45.360
know how to enlighten them through this power
– can you imagine?

06:45.360 --> 06:52.209
This knowledge became – sort of - a knowledge
which people would not accept, because we

06:52.209 --> 06:54.550
live with science or rationality.

06:54.550 --> 07:01.479
This is something beyond that, but Einstein
has said so, Einstein has said very clearly

07:01.479 --> 07:06.150
- that there is a torsion area beyond the
mind.

07:06.150 --> 07:16.680
And you have to go to that torsion area where
you can get cognitive science – called science,

07:16.680 --> 07:19.990
but I would say, cognitive personality.

07:19.990 --> 07:23.480
So, how is it going to happen to go beyond
the mind?

07:23.480 --> 07:27.960
If you try anything it is through your mind
only.

07:27.960 --> 07:30.120
Whatever you do is through your mind.

07:30.120 --> 07:34.850
So to go beyond your mind is not possible.

07:34.850 --> 07:42.630
Now this power lies in the triangular bone,
which we can see also clearly sometimes in

07:42.630 --> 07:46.080
some people who have obstruction, where it
cannot rise.

07:46.080 --> 07:51.560
You see the pulsation in the triangular bone
which is just a bone.

07:51.560 --> 07:58.100
But when it rises it is a so smooth movement
of this power.

07:58.100 --> 08:03.900
Now there are some people who have written
that this is a very dangerous thing and this

08:03.900 --> 08:10.310
happens and that happens, maybe because they
can’t explain, maybe because they don’t

08:10.310 --> 08:17.020
know anything about it perhaps, maybe they
do not want to know human beings to have it.

08:17.020 --> 08:27.120
Now, this power is kept within us because
now our last breakthrough of our evolution

08:27.120 --> 08:29.160
has to take place.

08:29.160 --> 08:36.860
We have to rise to that state which you can
call self-realized or there is 1001 names

08:36.860 --> 08:37.860
for it.

08:37.860 --> 08:45.849
So many people had this power within them
- they felt it also but they were not so much

08:45.849 --> 08:47.560
capable I think, of raising the Kundalini.

08:47.560 --> 08:50.620
Sufis, you have heard about.

08:50.620 --> 08:59.050
Saints, many saints – William Blake, I would
say, from England, there were so many people.

08:59.050 --> 09:00.780
Shakespeare is another one.

09:00.780 --> 09:02.250
They all were realized souls.

09:02.250 --> 09:09.509
The way they have expressed themselves shows
very well how detached they were and how beautifully

09:09.509 --> 09:13.069
they understood the reality.

09:13.069 --> 09:19.810
So when this Kundalini rises as they have
been told, She passes through these six centres.

09:19.810 --> 09:27.699
And these six centres are responsible for
our physical, mental, emotional and spiritual

09:27.699 --> 09:28.699
being.

09:28.699 --> 09:39.460
So, when these centres go into jeopardy, some
because of exhaustion, maybe something, then

09:39.460 --> 09:43.259
it is needed to be nourished and this Kundalini
nourishes them.

09:43.259 --> 09:47.550
Not only It nourishes but It also integrates
them.

09:47.550 --> 09:53.439
So you get your personality in a state where
you are completely integrated.

09:53.439 --> 09:57.020
But then She pierces through your fontanel
bone area.

09:57.020 --> 10:00.590
This is the actualisation of baptism, you
can say.

10:00.590 --> 10:07.919
Actually She pierces through and gets you
connected to the all pervading power of Divine

10:07.919 --> 10:08.919
Love.

10:08.919 --> 10:10.930
It’s all love, nothing else but love.

10:10.930 --> 10:14.710
Truth is love and love is truth.

10:14.710 --> 10:21.090
And when She becomes one with that you are
a transformed personality.

10:21.090 --> 10:23.800
Firstly your centres are enlightened.

10:23.800 --> 10:31.780
So your health improves, mentally you get
balanced and also emotionally you understand.

10:31.780 --> 10:40.650
But the greatest thing that happens to you
is that you become a new personality with

10:40.650 --> 10:42.009
collective consciousness.

10:42.009 --> 10:45.599
Jung has talked about it – “collective
consciousness”.

10:45.599 --> 10:48.539
That you can feel another person.

10:48.539 --> 10:51.229
You can feel your own centres on your fingertips.

10:51.229 --> 10:57.780
First you feel the cool breeze in your hand.

10:57.780 --> 11:05.749
That is the cool breeze described in the bible
as “the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost”.

11:05.749 --> 11:08.730
And also in Sanskrit language they call it
“Saleelam, Saleelam”.

11:08.730 --> 11:10.410
In Koran it is described as “Ruh”.

11:10.410 --> 11:12.639
Everywhere it is described with different
names, meaning the same.

11:12.639 --> 11:19.010
You start feeling this cool breeze in your
hands, specially on your fingertips and these

11:19.010 --> 11:23.540
fingertips denote your different chakras as
shown there.

11:23.540 --> 11:31.150
So, if there is something wrong with your
centres, then it is indicated on your fingertips;

11:31.150 --> 11:37.020
but if it is something wrong with others also
it is indicated because you become, - again

11:37.020 --> 11:43.600
I say, it’s a question of becoming - you
become collectively conscious.

11:43.600 --> 11:52.670
But with that you are not disturbed, you are
absolutely at peace with yourself and absolutely

11:52.670 --> 11:53.670
satisfied.

11:53.670 --> 11:58.999
How it happens that our mind is always thinking
about the future, about the past.

11:58.999 --> 12:07.580
And our mind is dancing over the cusp of these
thoughts, which are like this.

12:07.580 --> 12:14.850
But when this Kundalini rises She elongates
them and there is a space in between created

12:14.850 --> 12:17.609
and that space is, what we can say, is the
present.

12:17.609 --> 12:25.869
We can be in the future, we can be in the
past, but we cannot be in the present, and

12:25.869 --> 12:28.700
when you are in the present you are absolutely
thoughtless.

12:28.700 --> 12:31.510
You just become a witness.

12:31.510 --> 12:40.570
A witness state comes into you and you start
watching everything, not reacting.

12:40.570 --> 12:43.430
And absorbing everything, very easy.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.790
It’s a very wonderful thing that happens
to you.

12:47.790 --> 12:56.070
So this mechanism is placed within you to
give you that special personality, to give

12:56.070 --> 13:01.320
you that new awareness of collective consciousness,
and the last breakthrough of your evolution.

13:01.320 --> 13:11.499
Till human awareness you are alright, till
that I must say they still are there somehow.

13:11.499 --> 13:17.970
But we are afraid of the future of human beings,
because such a turmoil, so many problems,

13:17.970 --> 13:25.100
so many kinds of ideas people have, which
is surprising that in these modern times what

13:25.100 --> 13:32.910
people are thinking: they are something absolutely
primitive, I should say, criminal.

13:32.910 --> 13:38.049
Violence and things, all this has to disappear.

13:38.049 --> 13:44.770
And I was happy to hear that you all want
transformation, the resurrection.

13:44.770 --> 13:52.080
You want transformation, and transformation
on a collective scale.

13:52.080 --> 13:55.540
This is quite possible, absolutely possible.

13:55.540 --> 14:03.249
Once you are transformed, you become a person
of tremendous love and patience.

14:03.249 --> 14:06.010
You love everything.

14:06.010 --> 14:09.169
You understand everything through love.

14:09.169 --> 14:18.840
It’s not love of – some sort of a – expectations,
it’s a love of giving.

14:18.840 --> 14:27.210
You just enjoy giving, giving everything is
so enjoyable that time, that state and you

14:27.210 --> 14:28.210
become so peaceful.

14:28.210 --> 14:34.060
Then, as you know, the economics is like that,
people will work very hard to have, say, a

14:34.060 --> 14:41.590
carpet like this and then this is all done,
then they will have some motorcar, then they

14:41.590 --> 14:48.160
want to have a house, I mean, goes on from
one to another, they are never satisfied.

14:48.160 --> 14:52.369
The thing for which you have worked so hard
is finished.

14:52.369 --> 14:56.720
Then again starts a new urge to have something
new.

14:56.720 --> 15:00.130
Goes on like that, the whole economics work
like that.

15:00.130 --> 15:05.601
But here, once I see this carpet, for example
here, I just go into thoughtless awareness.

15:05.601 --> 15:07.450
And what do I see?

15:07.450 --> 15:17.260
I see the joy, I feel the joy of the person,
of the artist, who makes and enjoy this.

15:17.260 --> 15:26.020
Otherwise thinking, I would think how much
it must have cost, where can I buy this, or

15:26.020 --> 15:33.049
if it is mine I would be worried, Oh God,
how I’ve not insured this, which has no

15:33.049 --> 15:34.049
meaning.

15:34.049 --> 15:38.370
But I cannot enjoy unless and until I become
thoughtlessly aware.

15:38.370 --> 15:43.930
Also in our Patanjali Yoga it is written down
as Nirvichara Samadhi.

15:43.930 --> 15:50.929
But he has made four stages of the whole thing
is that first is this “Sarvichar”.

15:50.929 --> 15:55.580
Sarvichar means “with thoughts” and then
without thoughts, but in Sahaja Yoga it is

15:55.580 --> 15:57.630
not so.

15:57.630 --> 16:06.570
It is so quick that you become thoughtlessly
aware first, and then you become doubtlessly

16:06.570 --> 16:07.570
aware.

16:07.570 --> 16:10.100
That is there are no doubts about yourself.

16:10.100 --> 16:15.530
You know there is a power flowing and you
know by experiment that this power, this power

16:15.530 --> 16:17.640
can cure people, can help others.

16:17.640 --> 16:19.950
And the attention, which is very high.

16:19.950 --> 16:27.489
Like I found people say “I like this, I
want this” - that disappears.

16:27.489 --> 16:30.169
Attention goes to others.

16:30.169 --> 16:38.910
You want to see what others would like, others
would feel, and the whole personality gets

16:38.910 --> 16:45.039
completely enshrined with the feeling of oneness
with others.

16:45.039 --> 16:48.550
It’s something has to happen to all of you.

16:48.550 --> 16:57.910
I’m happy I lived in England at least for
20 or 22 years and couldn’t meet you people.

16:57.910 --> 16:59.390
But now, thank God, you people have thought
of it.

16:59.390 --> 17:01.979
Now we live with science and rationality.

17:01.979 --> 17:05.729
This is something beyond that, as I told you.

17:05.729 --> 17:11.950
It is beyond science and rationality which
is accepted as cognitive science, people say.

17:11.950 --> 17:17.700
And also as I’ve told you Einstein has talked
about the torsion area.

17:17.700 --> 17:22.499
But how to achieve it, I don’t think he
has written anything about it.

17:22.499 --> 17:30.270
So this is your own power within yourself
for which I don’t have to do anything – they

17:30.270 --> 17:32.039
might have said it, alright.

17:32.039 --> 17:33.109
I accept it.

17:33.109 --> 17:36.530
But once it rises in you, it’s like one
candle can enlighten many candles.

17:36.530 --> 17:42.669
And that’s how you can spread Sahaja Yoga
very far.

17:42.669 --> 17:50.320
We have, say, they say so, we are now in 72
countries, possibly.

17:50.320 --> 17:54.260
Because one person gets it, he goes to his
country, starts working.

17:54.260 --> 18:00.429
And India, of course, Indians know this very
well, they know they have to achieve only

18:00.429 --> 18:01.440
this.

18:01.440 --> 18:09.090
Like some people told me that we are like
Indian culture.

18:09.090 --> 18:17.060
So, we have taken to Indian style of life
and we are very satisfied.

18:17.060 --> 18:19.660
I said “Is that the end?”

18:19.660 --> 18:23.470
We have so many Indians who are following
that culture.

18:23.470 --> 18:25.059
Are they satisfied people?

18:25.059 --> 18:27.140
Is that the end?

18:27.140 --> 18:32.700
What have you to do according to Indian scriptures
also - that you have to know yourself.

18:32.700 --> 18:34.220
You don’t know yourself.

18:34.220 --> 18:39.380
You don’t know what’s wrong with you,
unless and until you can feel your centres

18:39.380 --> 18:40.950
on your fingertips.

18:40.950 --> 18:46.479
You will not know what’s wrong with you
– till you end up with something horrible.

18:46.479 --> 18:51.820
But as soon as you get your Realisation, immediately
you can feel it on your fingertips - your

18:51.820 --> 18:52.820
problems.

18:52.820 --> 18:58.820
Now, supposing you know how to cure it, you
can cure anybody’s and you don’t have

18:58.820 --> 18:59.880
to pay for it.

18:59.880 --> 19:05.290
See, again and again I’ve said that “it
is your own, it’s your power.

19:05.290 --> 19:08.740
You can’t pay for it.”

19:08.740 --> 19:14.890
I don’t know how people believe that for
spirituality you can pay, it cannot be sold.

19:14.890 --> 19:17.880
In America it was very difficult.

19:17.880 --> 19:21.220
They all came to me and told me: “You have
to sell it”.

19:21.220 --> 19:22.240
I said: “How?”

19:22.240 --> 19:25.640
They said: “Do something, otherwise nobody
will come to you.”

19:25.640 --> 19:30.239
I said: “But I cannot do something that
is not done.”

19:30.239 --> 19:34.600
So they said: “Alright, you do one thing:
take money from them and tell them that when

19:34.600 --> 19:39.789
you come for follow-up you will get back your
money.”

19:39.789 --> 19:46.580
So much we are bound by money that if you
have paid the money you think you are bound.

19:46.580 --> 19:48.100
You have to do it.

19:48.100 --> 19:50.850
And absurd things like that human beings think.

19:50.850 --> 19:55.559
But why don’t they think that we have to
change this world?

19:55.559 --> 19:59.780
They have to have emancipation of human being.

19:59.780 --> 20:00.780
Why now?

20:00.780 --> 20:06.720
Instead of doing all kinds of other things,
the best thing is to change yourself, transform

20:06.720 --> 20:08.519
yourself and enjoy.

20:08.519 --> 20:11.080
And enjoyment is complete.

20:11.080 --> 20:15.060
Because enjoyment is singular.

20:15.060 --> 20:19.240
It is not happiness, unhappiness, it’s just
enjoyment.

20:19.240 --> 20:21.360
You enjoy everything.

20:21.360 --> 20:24.150
Even the smallest thing can give you enjoyment.

20:24.150 --> 20:33.000
And then you don’t start feeling depressed
or doing that kind of a tantrums that you

20:33.000 --> 20:39.450
do to trouble others, but you are so much
enjoying and everybody enjoys you also, because

20:39.450 --> 20:41.170
you are so enjoyable.

20:41.170 --> 20:46.450
That’s the thing that should happen to human
beings and when it happens it’s something

20:46.450 --> 20:52.400
really very, very great and that should happen
to all of you.

20:52.400 --> 20:55.210
And I’ll be very happy, I was told you are
all very great dignitaries here and you can

20:55.210 --> 21:08.480
do a lot and this is how we have a chance
of first of all getting your Self Realisation.

21:08.480 --> 21:11.120
Knowing your Self.

21:11.120 --> 21:14.639
And then helping people.

21:14.639 --> 21:17.779
With a genuine love and affection.

21:17.779 --> 21:23.763
I don’t know how much I should talk because
we’ve had so many lectures after lectures

21:23.763 --> 21:25.230
and there’s no end to it.

21:25.230 --> 21:29.350
But lecturing doesn’t help – it is something
else to work out within yourself.

21:29.350 --> 21:31.500
That is the most important thing.

21:31.500 --> 21:36.700
Now, I would like also to have some questions
from you.

21:36.700 --> 21:43.580
If you have gone thoughtless I can’t help
it.

21:43.580 --> 21:52.389
Question: Have you overcome all the fears
of life?

21:52.389 --> 21:59.240
You are not afraid of death also?

25:26.568 --> 25:31.248
Shri Mataji: I don’t know that part, but
definitely I knew that I have to find out

25:31.248 --> 25:39.058
a way and method by which I could give en-masse
realisation.

25:39.058 --> 25:43.397
Because people used to give realisation, no
doubt, but one person used to give to one

25:43.397 --> 25:44.397
person.

25:44.397 --> 25:47.164
One of the reasons maybe because anybody who
was saintly, people used to torture them,

25:47.164 --> 25:48.164
trouble them.

25:48.164 --> 25:49.164
They wouldn’t like a person like that because
that person was something – out of the blue,

25:49.164 --> 25:50.164
you can call it.

25:50.164 --> 25:54.808
So that was an attitude towards a person who
was a realised soul.

25:54.808 --> 26:04.877
Everybody suffered, whether they were Sufis
or they were – otherwise even William Blake,

26:04.877 --> 26:12.688
I mean, everyone whosoever said something
different, people didn’t like.

26:12.688 --> 26:19.418
So maybe that’s the reason they used to
give it to one person.

26:19.418 --> 26:20.548
That was the tradition.

26:20.548 --> 26:26.858
Realisation was such that out of thousands
they used to select one person, work on him,

26:26.858 --> 26:30.678
cleanse him, do this, do that and then give
realisation.

26:30.678 --> 26:31.897
One person.

26:31.897 --> 26:38.527
But I felt that the time has come that you
must give en-masse realisation.

26:38.527 --> 26:44.688
Unless and until people get en-masse realisation,
we cannot change this world.

26:44.688 --> 26:48.378
And I worked, I should say, for days together.

26:48.378 --> 26:53.918
Luckily my father was a very social personality,
even my husband was.

26:53.918 --> 26:56.848
So I had a good chance to meet people.

26:56.848 --> 27:03.978
In my own subtle ways I used to find out what
is the permutation and combination of problems

27:03.978 --> 27:08.048
inside the human beings and then how to work
it out.

27:08.048 --> 27:13.478
That’s the only thing I did more, I think,
otherwise so many people used to give Self

27:13.478 --> 27:15.517
Realisation at different times.

27:15.517 --> 27:21.178
But what I found out a method by which thousands
of people can get realisation.

27:21.178 --> 27:23.648
Question: How did you come upon this method?

27:23.648 --> 27:26.108
Shri Mataji: Just, you see, I discovered it.

27:26.108 --> 27:36.878
You see, it’s a thing I worked it out.

27:36.878 --> 27:48.238
Have all gone thoughtless, or what?

27:48.238 --> 27:52.027
Yes, madam?

27:52.027 --> 28:05.767
Question: When you depart from this body,
as this lady was asking, where does the spirit,

28:05.767 --> 28:08.038
where do the energy stay?

28:08.038 --> 28:14.168
Shri Mataji: Spirit – it’s a very long
answer, but I would say, Spirit goes according

28:14.168 --> 28:16.868
to its desire, alright.

28:16.868 --> 28:26.158
Now, supposing there is a drunkard, who dies,
now he wants to drink still, even if he’s

28:26.158 --> 28:27.158
dead.

28:27.158 --> 28:34.298
He will hang in somewhere in the limbo, I
think, he will get hold of somebody who drinks

28:34.298 --> 28:36.938
a lot.

28:36.938 --> 28:43.247
This side of psychology, people don’t understand
in the west.

28:43.247 --> 28:46.377
Because it’s nothing in the medicine about
this.

28:46.377 --> 28:53.527
The other day I read a very nice article about
it, was published in America.

28:53.527 --> 28:58.008
That Japanese believe that you get possessed
by a spirit.

28:58.008 --> 29:03.318
Even in the bible it is so that you get possessed
by the spirit.

29:03.318 --> 29:09.738
But they have said that 50 to 60% people get
possessed.

29:09.738 --> 29:14.158
Schizophrenia, all kinds of psychological
problems come from that.

29:14.158 --> 29:18.308
Now, in India also we believe in it.

29:18.308 --> 29:25.818
And if you can remove the possession of a
person the person completely changes, no doubt.

29:25.818 --> 29:30.698
But this is still in the realm of science,
you cannot get it.

29:30.698 --> 29:36.647
I mean, I would say that, psychology is still
a childish science and in that realm they

29:36.647 --> 29:40.108
don’t understand what is this possession.

29:40.108 --> 29:47.517
Is a fact that so far they have not gone into
it, but we know in Sahaja Yoga very clearly,

29:47.517 --> 29:56.418
because we get catches on the left hand side,
say here on this thumb, that means a person

29:56.418 --> 29:57.418
is possessed.

29:57.418 --> 30:01.808
Yes, it’s like that, it’s so simple.

30:01.808 --> 30:04.908
And then you can cure that person.

30:04.908 --> 30:06.767
So many persons have been cured.

30:06.767 --> 30:07.928
So many.

30:07.928 --> 30:16.777
Who have given up as lunatics, or schizophrenic
or all kinds have been cured, no doubt.

30:16.777 --> 30:22.678
But it is to be seen and to be worked out,
then you can believe it.

30:22.678 --> 30:26.438
Because people don’t believe that there
is such a thing.

30:26.438 --> 30:28.118
But there is.

30:28.118 --> 30:32.997
There is some sort of a negative force which
overpowers human beings, it is true.

30:32.997 --> 30:35.988
I must tell you the truth.

30:35.988 --> 30:49.168
We have had so many cases, even in England,
where people were possessed.

30:49.168 --> 30:50.218
So many cases.

30:50.218 --> 30:58.678
On the contrary I would say that cancer and
all psychosomatic troubles come to people

30:58.678 --> 31:01.248
when they shift to the left side.

31:01.248 --> 31:03.228
Means to the past.

31:03.228 --> 31:09.818
Maybe some viruses which are dead long time
back are in our being – that everything

31:09.818 --> 31:11.678
is past is in our being.

31:11.678 --> 31:13.108
So they can attack.

31:13.108 --> 31:18.238
And I’ve told them long time back somehow
through this cognitive knowledge that they

31:18.238 --> 31:23.710
will call by 53 proteins and 63 progenides
[ ? UNCLEAR] I told them.

31:23.710 --> 31:28.088
And now they know it is so.

31:28.088 --> 31:32.838
So cancer is curable in Sahaja Yoga, we have
cured cancers, of many people.

31:32.838 --> 31:34.368
Absolutely curable.

31:34.368 --> 31:41.308
We have an hospital in India, already established
near Bombay.

31:41.308 --> 31:44.757
There’s a nice hospital where people are
cured.

31:44.757 --> 31:49.757
And we don’t charge them for any treatment,
only for the stay.

31:49.757 --> 31:59.408
It’s a fact, you see, because people never
talk about it, they never told you.

31:59.408 --> 32:04.108
So you think it’s a, some sort of a mythological
thing, it’s not.

32:04.108 --> 32:11.208
It is there, it exists.

32:11.208 --> 32:15.617
So many diseases are not cured because we
don’t know about them.

32:15.617 --> 32:23.658
You see, I was myself in a medical school,
so I know that they know very limited things.

32:23.658 --> 32:26.788
Beyond that, they don’t know.

32:26.788 --> 32:27.788
But in Japan, I was surprised that they believe
in it and they treat people.

32:27.788 --> 32:33.798
Even in India, I mean, they know.

32:33.798 --> 32:45.507
Question: What do you give, provide the definition
of enlightenment?

32:45.507 --> 32:59.257
Shri Mataji: Enlightened means a personality,
enlightened personality, I can tell you, is

32:59.257 --> 33:05.757
a person who is beyond his mind.

33:05.757 --> 33:13.007
And he is in contact completely with this
all-pervading power of divine love.

33:13.007 --> 33:21.578
As a result everything in that person is guided,
helped by that divine love.

33:21.578 --> 33:32.608
That power is so great that it looks after
you, it organizes everything, it thinks, it

33:32.608 --> 33:37.238
understands, it is wisdom of all the things.

33:37.238 --> 33:43.738
You become a person who is so collectively
conscious.

33:43.738 --> 33:47.517
Today we need people like that.

33:47.517 --> 33:49.858
Otherwise you always think about yourself.

33:49.858 --> 33:58.098
About others you can only think when you are
collectively conscious.

33:58.098 --> 34:03.517
But these days there are so many people marketing
their spirituality, you see.

34:03.517 --> 34:05.387
That’s also there.

34:05.387 --> 34:08.088
And just people jump to it, I don’t know
why.

34:08.088 --> 34:17.867
Why don’t they find out what is the gain,
what did you gain out of it?

34:17.867 --> 34:24.497
Nobody wants to know.

34:24.497 --> 34:45.978
Question: How did you find America?

34:45.978 --> 34:48.848
Shri Mataji: They are antipodes.

34:48.848 --> 34:54.237
I don’t know what to say, they are very
money-oriented, extremely money-oriented.

34:54.237 --> 35:00.418
And they can’t understand me because I’m
not asking for money, you see, they can’t

35:00.418 --> 35:01.418
understand.

35:01.418 --> 35:02.418
It’s very difficult.

35:02.418 --> 35:06.588
And how to penetrate that veil of theirs?

35:06.588 --> 35:16.257
So, this time it has been much better, I should
say, I’ve been there.

35:16.257 --> 35:21.848
I went first, long time back, 1973 I went
there, and I saw the people how mad they were.

35:21.848 --> 35:26.258
After one boy was a 16 years old guru, you
see.

35:26.258 --> 35:28.737
They just giving money to him.

35:28.737 --> 35:32.468
So, I asked him “Why they are giving money?”

35:32.468 --> 35:34.007
What is the need to give money like this?

35:34.007 --> 35:35.007
To this guru?

35:35.007 --> 35:37.358
They said: “Because he is giving us spirit.”

35:37.358 --> 35:40.647
Where is he giving you spirit?

35:40.647 --> 35:47.478
And then this fellow, he was wiser than others
I should say, because he settled down as a

35:47.478 --> 35:54.117
young one, he married some American lady and
used his money, but all the rest of them,

35:54.117 --> 36:02.938
so many of them, went there to befool them.

36:02.938 --> 36:04.908
It’s endless.

36:04.908 --> 36:07.848
Still going on.

36:07.848 --> 36:21.838
But unless and until you accept the truth,
you cannot change.

36:21.838 --> 36:24.498
Accept us in the sense you have to ask for
it.

36:24.498 --> 36:26.498
You should have pure desire.

36:26.498 --> 36:33.538
This Kundalini is the power of pure desire
within you.

36:33.538 --> 36:36.608
When She rises She gives you your pure desire.

36:36.608 --> 36:40.608
Not like this, changing from one to another.

36:40.608 --> 36:44.448
And if you have pure desire only then it works
out.

36:44.448 --> 36:58.387
If you don’t have, it won’t work out - no.

36:58.387 --> 37:01.158
I cannot force it.

37:01.158 --> 37:11.258
Cannot be forced, you see.

37:11.258 --> 37:16.828
Question: How are children, young children?

37:16.828 --> 37:18.017
Shri Mataji: Oh, some of them are great.

37:18.017 --> 37:23.158
These days so many realised souls have been
born, these state [or these days?

37:23.158 --> 37:24.588
UNCLEAR] . We don’t understand them.

37:24.588 --> 37:30.068
But there are so many, even in England there
are born so many of them.

37:30.068 --> 37:39.548
Born realized – they are special ones.

37:39.548 --> 37:46.408
I mean, this fact, it happens, so many good
things happen to the society, like drug addiction,

37:46.408 --> 37:52.918
over night people in this England gave up
drugs, over night.

37:52.918 --> 38:02.147
I’ve got one land far away from madding
crowd, I should say, in upstate New York,

38:02.147 --> 38:09.887
and I wanted to start a curative centre for
drug addicts, because that is one of the big

38:09.887 --> 38:11.678
problems here.

38:11.678 --> 38:14.117
But they said the public won’t allow.

38:14.117 --> 38:15.267
I said: “Why?”

38:15.267 --> 38:17.198
They said: “They go amok.”

38:17.198 --> 38:24.418
This place is so far fetched, you cannot give
a walk all the way – and if, I mean, they

38:24.418 --> 38:27.298
allow me I could help a lot.

38:27.298 --> 38:30.828
But somehow, even in Italy, is difficult.

38:30.828 --> 38:38.098
And the biggest problem today, even in America,
is drug addiction.

38:38.098 --> 38:41.698
Another you can call AIDS.

38:41.698 --> 38:48.068
We tried AIDS also, but AIDS-people are something
wrong with them, they are extremely arrogant.

38:48.068 --> 38:52.968
Quarrelsome, arrogant, they think they are
martyrs - something like that.

38:52.968 --> 38:57.738
We’ve tried, we’ve helped one or two – no
doubt.

38:57.738 --> 38:58.738
But it’s very difficult.

38:58.738 --> 39:01.208
But these drug addicts can’t be helped very
easily.

39:01.208 --> 39:06.978
But there is no proper way, if you all can
arrange something - I would like to.

39:06.978 --> 39:13.487
In your, this London city only, I should say,
at least 10 or 11 people like that.

39:13.487 --> 39:15.138
First time I talked they’ve got cured.

39:15.138 --> 39:23.358
They were all doing very well, were very well
educated.

39:23.358 --> 39:28.798
All these problems can be solved.

39:28.798 --> 39:33.357
But the government should help, in a way.

39:33.357 --> 39:39.538
Because you know they, so much time even to
take permission for something.

39:39.538 --> 39:45.867
Sometimes like 10 years, 20 years, you go
on applying.

39:45.867 --> 39:49.757
I am already very old and I don’t know what
will happen, if I go on like this.

39:49.757 --> 39:52.147
For 20 years for a permission.

39:52.147 --> 39:53.308
Very difficult.

39:53.308 --> 40:01.468
But you people can organize something like
that.

40:01.468 --> 40:08.928
And I can work it out.

40:08.928 --> 40:15.148
You can see the results.

40:15.148 --> 40:19.588
You can see the results, you can save these
children.

40:19.588 --> 40:20.588
Alcoholism, alcoholism also can be corrected.

40:20.588 --> 40:21.588
Yes, please?

40:21.588 --> 40:22.588
Question: Shri Mataji, would you say a few
words about the golden age?

40:22.588 --> 40:25.378
The forthcoming golden age?

40:25.378 --> 40:39.039
Shri Mataji: You see, Aquarius, as they say,
Aquarius according to our astrology is the

40:39.039 --> 40:40.039
Kundalini.

40:40.039 --> 40:48.308
The Kundalini is Aquarius according to Indian,
I should say, Indian science of (HINDI word

40:48.308 --> 40:50.928
– Sir C.P. explains:)

40:50.928 --> 40:51.928
Astrology.

40:51.928 --> 41:00.708
And, you see, they, what they say that this
age of Aquarius is very important, because

41:00.708 --> 41:04.528
this will change the lives of people.

41:04.528 --> 41:13.358
And that is what they have already described
about this, that now there was Kali Yuga,

41:13.358 --> 41:15.658
means the worst possible times.

41:15.658 --> 41:24.428
The whole Kali Yuga means the absolutely the
worst and worst possible time for our destruction.

41:24.428 --> 41:26.708
That was over.

41:26.708 --> 41:32.008
Then comes Kruta Yuga, I mean, overlapping.

41:32.008 --> 41:39.788
Now, in Kruta Yuga, this all-pervading power,
they call it Paramchaitanya, becomes active.

41:39.788 --> 41:44.038
It starts helping people to come along.

41:44.038 --> 41:48.148
That also has been going on some days.

41:48.148 --> 41:50.488
After this, is Satya Yuga.

41:50.488 --> 41:54.148
It’s the age of truth.

41:54.148 --> 41:57.718
But it’s a last judgement.

41:57.718 --> 42:00.388
If you take to truth, alright, well and good.

42:00.388 --> 42:02.268
But if you don’t take to truth you are judged.

42:02.268 --> 42:03.268
It’s like this.

42:03.268 --> 42:04.418
Now how many people take to truth, very surprising.

42:04.418 --> 42:09.348
Like a place like Russia, you’ll be amazed
- Russia.

42:09.348 --> 42:10.998
Country like Russia.

42:10.998 --> 42:18.838
I went there and I first time went to Saint
Petersburg, that’s Leningrad that time.

42:18.838 --> 42:30.928
And when I went to the hall I saw about 2000
people sitting outside.

42:30.928 --> 42:40.398
Because there you have to pay for a hall,
I mean, the hall people.

42:40.398 --> 42:42.168
So, 2000 seats were all occupied inside.

42:42.168 --> 42:46.928
So these people outside, people said: “Maa,
are you not going to give us realisation?”

42:46.928 --> 42:53.018
I said: “How do they know all this?”

42:53.018 --> 42:54.018
Somebody must have told them.

42:54.018 --> 43:00.118
When I went in I said: “Alright, wait, I’ll
come back then I’ll give you Realisation.”

43:00.118 --> 43:02.448
So, I went inside.

43:02.448 --> 43:09.428
Inside there were 2000 people nicely sitting
down, listening to me and then they got their

43:09.428 --> 43:10.428
realisation.

43:10.428 --> 43:11.428
All of them.

43:11.428 --> 43:12.428
I was amazed.

43:12.428 --> 43:13.428
What’s the matter?

43:13.428 --> 43:15.778
How is it they’re working so fast?

43:15.778 --> 43:23.198
And then I came out and I saw there were again
these 2000 still sitting there.

43:23.198 --> 43:25.438
45 minutes they were still.

43:25.438 --> 43:30.358
I said: “Alright, you all come tomorrow
morning, we’ll sit outside.”

43:30.358 --> 43:35.258
Now, in Moscow they have huge big places,
huge big compounds and buildings.

43:35.258 --> 43:41.778
I said: “I’ll sit on the steps and I’ll
try to give you realisation.”

43:41.778 --> 43:47.368
You won’t believe – 2000 from inside,
2000 from outside and one thousand extra,

43:47.368 --> 43:54.038
I mean, 5000 people gathered there next morning
and they all got their realisation.

43:54.038 --> 44:00.158
In Moscow, you won’t believe how many people,
if somebody asks me, I cannot say, have got

44:00.158 --> 44:01.158
realisation.

44:01.158 --> 44:04.908
Now, the reason, I reasoned it out what must
be the reason.

44:04.908 --> 44:08.498
I asked them: “How is it?

44:08.498 --> 44:11.488
Had you advertised that much?”

44:11.488 --> 44:15.668
“No”, they said, “we saw your photograph.

44:15.668 --> 44:16.868
We knew.

44:16.868 --> 44:18.058
We came.”

44:18.058 --> 44:20.458
So sensitive, I say.

44:20.458 --> 44:25.518
And thousands and thousands have got realisation.

44:25.518 --> 44:31.668
These people are so deep, so deep, so humble.

44:31.668 --> 44:42.508
I couldn’t understand why, why are they
so much spiritually endowed, how did they

44:42.508 --> 44:45.778
get all this.

44:45.778 --> 44:52.148
And what I found is that communism has given
them no freedom of any kind.

44:52.148 --> 44:59.848
And as a result, I think, they got completely
oppressed and the whole thing growth was inside.

44:59.848 --> 45:09.168
And also if you have read those great novelist,
even Tolstoi, or anyone - they always show

45:09.168 --> 45:19.168
introspection, even by the hero or by the
villain, anybody, they all introspect.

45:19.168 --> 45:25.238
And this is the one, I thought, is the very
deep personalities they develop.

45:25.238 --> 45:29.058
And immediately they got it.

45:29.058 --> 45:33.818
A far fetched place called Togliatti where
they make motorcars, thousands and thousands

45:33.818 --> 45:38.938
– we could not get to any hall, because
formerly, I mean, normally what was the thing

45:38.938 --> 45:50.730
we were taken, we would have to take a stadium
– 18 to 20.000 in Moscow or Leningrad or

45:50.730 --> 45:52.398
a big city.

45:52.398 --> 45:54.878
But in Togliatti we didn’t know what to
do.

45:54.878 --> 45:56.318
So we just had it in the open.

45:56.318 --> 45:57.318
Thousands and thousands.

45:57.318 --> 45:58.468
But not in England – no.

45:58.468 --> 45:59.548
Much worse is America.

45:59.548 --> 46:00.618
I don’t know why.

46:00.618 --> 46:03.238
Even Indians in England are no good.

46:03.238 --> 46:10.378
I just don’t know what happens to them.

46:10.378 --> 46:24.108
They are neither English nor Indian, I think,
something is, but we have very few Indians

46:24.108 --> 46:27.858
even, I must tell you this, very frankly.

46:27.858 --> 46:35.528
But in India we have so many, so thousands
and thousands who have got realisation.

46:35.528 --> 46:42.888
Though Indians know they have to have self
realisation, even here.

46:42.888 --> 46:47.688
But somehow they are fed up, I don’t know
of what.

46:47.688 --> 46:53.348
Even if you read Shakespeare you feel like
understanding that he was a great realised

46:53.348 --> 46:54.348
soul.

46:54.348 --> 47:02.038
What he showed was the futility of human endeavour
in every line, it’s clearly shown.

47:02.038 --> 47:05.618
That’s what he was.

47:05.618 --> 47:14.018
I can’t understand, see, because I’ve
read so much Indian novels and English novels

47:14.018 --> 47:16.278
and English writers.

47:16.278 --> 47:17.898
I find all of them are so enlightened.

47:17.898 --> 47:22.248
Can’t understand what’s happening in England
now.

47:22.248 --> 47:23.248
Why?

47:23.248 --> 47:35.318
Now, 20 years I’ve been in England, first
time I’m meeting people like you.

47:35.318 --> 47:36.898
Why?

47:36.898 --> 47:44.838
I would ask you, people.

47:44.838 --> 47:51.198
Really, I can’t understand.

47:51.198 --> 47:55.038
Even Austria, you have thousands.

47:55.038 --> 47:58.518
Italy, where Roman Catholics you know, are
so many.

47:58.518 --> 48:00.448
Italians, wonderful.

48:00.448 --> 48:01.448
Thousands.

48:01.448 --> 48:08.688
But I didn’t live so long there as I‘ve
lived in England.

48:08.688 --> 48:12.808
Moreover, you see, language-wise, I know this
language, though I never studied English,

48:12.808 --> 48:18.258
but I know English language, how to speak.

48:18.258 --> 48:28.878
But there in their language, it’s Italian
or, I don’t know how.

48:28.878 --> 48:37.928
I’m very happy today that you all have come
and I hope now from you it will start going

48:37.928 --> 48:39.608
into other people.

48:39.608 --> 48:47.518
Because it’s very important: we have to
change this world.

48:47.518 --> 48:51.738
And, I would say, they also said, some newspaper
people have come, but I said: “I’m sorry,

48:51.738 --> 48:55.118
I don’t know what they will think of me.”

48:55.118 --> 48:58.018
Because they have never been very supportive.

48:58.018 --> 49:01.738
But I think they don’t realise their responsibility.

49:01.738 --> 49:02.738
Really!

49:02.738 --> 49:10.798
Sometimes I see newspapers, I think they don’t
realise how much they are harming people by

49:10.798 --> 49:12.048
wrong directions.

49:12.048 --> 49:15.228
By sensational things.

49:15.228 --> 49:21.078
What they have to do is to see what will be
the effect of these things that we are writing.

49:21.078 --> 49:29.058
Is it going to help them to rise above all
these things like jealousies and violence

49:29.058 --> 49:36.508
and all these things that are really completely
corroding our humanity.

49:36.508 --> 49:45.928
So, I think, all those lines, I don’t find
them and by head, I would say, I’ve met

49:45.928 --> 49:47.668
some of them, they were just after me.

49:47.668 --> 49:49.438
“How is it you are in England?”

49:49.438 --> 49:54.008
I said: “Because my husband has a job here,
that’s how I’ve come.”

49:54.008 --> 49:56.248
Then all kinds of funny, funny questions they
were asking.

49:56.248 --> 50:02.968
You know, I was surprised, they are not interested
in spirituality at all.

50:02.968 --> 50:14.498
So, then, whenever they said “Mother, somebody
is coming from there” I said: “Now - please.”

50:14.498 --> 50:17.218
All kinds of things they would say.

50:17.218 --> 50:21.228
“Your country is so poor, what are you doing
here?”

50:21.228 --> 50:24.198
Then I had to tell them why we are poor.

50:24.198 --> 50:33.598
I said: “300 years if you have a guest in
your house without a visa what will happen

50:33.598 --> 50:35.218
to you?”

50:35.218 --> 50:46.498
Then another question: “Why you have got
so many, such a big population, so many children

50:46.498 --> 50:47.498
born?”

50:47.498 --> 50:55.058
I said: “In that also, I would say, that
what I have read about England is this, that

50:55.058 --> 50:58.198
so many children are killed every week, by
the parents even.”

50:58.198 --> 51:07.088
I said: “So, the children must be deciding
to be born in a poor country than in a country

51:07.088 --> 51:09.808
where they can be killed.”

51:09.808 --> 51:13.068
I mean, simple thing like that.

51:13.068 --> 51:17.968
Because children want love, they don’t understand
anything else.

51:17.968 --> 51:20.318
So like that they asked me funny, funny questions.

51:20.318 --> 51:26.688
I said: “I am here for spirituality, talking
to about spirituality, and why should I worry

51:26.688 --> 51:33.178
about what I am, what is this and what is
that?”

51:33.178 --> 51:38.148
Say, we have to change our attitude.

51:38.148 --> 51:40.028
Very important.

51:40.028 --> 51:44.558
Of course I know some people who are very
broad, broad minded attitude towards people,

51:44.558 --> 51:45.608
very much.

51:45.608 --> 51:51.208
I’ve known some in India also, but there
are so few.

51:51.208 --> 51:57.748
If this thing has to be done it has to be
mass-scale.

51:57.748 --> 52:04.238
Now, we have Sahaja Yogis, many Sahaja Yogis,
I should say, but still I’m not satisfied.

52:04.238 --> 52:10.328
I think we need many more.

52:10.328 --> 52:11.348
Hindustani…

52:11.348 --> 52:12.368
HINDI…

52:12.368 --> 52:26.328
I don’t know why.

52:26.328 --> 52:38.048
Such a big tradition you have in our country.

52:38.048 --> 52:45.418
Instead of bringing that here to this country,
I don’t know what’s happening.

52:45.418 --> 52:48.628
And they are also very, very spiritual people.

52:48.628 --> 52:55.388
There too, you read their books you see, you’ll
be amazed.

52:55.388 --> 52:56.618
Very spiritual.

52:56.618 --> 53:03.378
But suddenly the whole thing has turned round,
I think so that spirituality has lost its

53:03.378 --> 53:04.378
power.

53:04.378 --> 53:10.568
And maybe some, you imported some of the horrible
gurus from there also might be.

53:10.568 --> 53:18.798
That might be another reason, I think so.

53:18.798 --> 53:23.728
But now, I think, they are very much reduced
in number, there are few still going round,

53:23.728 --> 53:24.748
making money, doesn’t matter.

53:24.748 --> 53:31.048
But now you people are very sensible, very
highly placed, you should do something about

53:31.048 --> 53:34.688
it, my request is.

53:34.688 --> 53:43.788
I’m available and never used to say, whatever
you say.

53:43.788 --> 53:46.828
It’s a new mission where you have to do
something.

53:46.828 --> 54:16.668
You are the ones who are going to completely
revolutionize the whole world.

54:16.668 --> 54:20.668
You can do it.

54:20.668 --> 54:24.228
Absolutely everybody is capable of doing that.

54:24.228 --> 54:25.998
Question: Another question: What’s your
opinion of Avataras?

54:25.998 --> 54:28.438
Shri Mataji: Alright, what’s the use of
my opinion about it?

54:28.438 --> 54:29.548
There are Avataras, no doubt.

54:29.548 --> 54:30.548
Alright?

54:30.548 --> 54:31.758
But you don’t believe me when I say that.

54:31.758 --> 54:33.808
Unless and until you experience you shouldn’t
believe even me.

54:33.808 --> 54:36.908
Alright, this is something and because you
asked me I’m saying so.

54:36.908 --> 54:41.018
But I don’t say you believe in some Avataras,
first of all you experience them.

54:41.018 --> 54:48.168
Everything that is now – you will know gradually
into different things and on every centre

54:48.168 --> 54:49.168
there is somebody sitting there.

54:49.168 --> 54:50.168
Who are they and what work they do?

54:50.168 --> 55:00.968
All this is to be consumed and to be seen
and to be experimented.

55:00.968 --> 55:05.948
Now, I say, supposing this centre is catching
…. [UNCLEAR] it is the centre very important

55:05.948 --> 55:12.328
because it is in the optic chiasma like this,
you see, it’s constricted.

55:12.328 --> 55:15.928
Now, how to open this?

55:15.928 --> 55:17.368
Very difficult.

55:17.368 --> 55:20.518
Now, I say, you forgive everybody.

55:20.518 --> 55:25.508
You forgive everybody – it opens.

55:25.508 --> 55:26.878
Why?

55:26.878 --> 55:31.298
Because Christ, Christ is on that centre.

55:31.298 --> 55:33.498
And his message is to forgive.

55:33.498 --> 55:42.478
Is, I mean, you should know who is on which
centre and what works out.

55:42.478 --> 55:45.848
That’s only to be known.

55:45.848 --> 55:51.438
Once you get your Self Realisation, only you
have to know this much, who is the one responsible

55:51.438 --> 55:53.418
for which chakras.

55:53.418 --> 55:54.728
That’s all.

55:54.728 --> 56:02.548
And you, you have to do according to – like
it’s a mantra now, to say that “I forgive

56:02.548 --> 56:03.548
everyone”.

56:03.548 --> 56:07.598
Now, some people would say it’s very difficult
to forgive.

56:07.598 --> 56:11.188
But logically: if you forgive or don’t forgive
– what are you doing?

56:11.188 --> 56:12.388
You don’t do anything.

56:12.388 --> 56:16.668
But if you don’t forgive then you torture
yourself.

56:16.668 --> 56:20.658
That’s why you forgive everyone.

56:20.658 --> 56:23.048
And this opens.

56:23.048 --> 56:27.838
Most constricted – it opens like this.

56:27.838 --> 56:34.228
Question: So, which God is for the Kundalini?

56:34.228 --> 56:35.348
Christ is over here.

56:35.348 --> 56:37.118
Which God is in the Kundalini?

56:37.118 --> 56:38.118
In the triangle?

56:38.118 --> 56:43.618
Sahaja Yogi: What is the God or the deity
in the triangular bone, the Kundalini?

56:43.618 --> 56:46.568
Shri Mataji: Kundalini itself.

56:46.568 --> 56:51.008
The Kundalini is your own mother.

56:51.008 --> 56:53.238
Your individual mother.

56:53.238 --> 56:59.378
And She has tape-recorded all your past and
your aspirations, everything.

56:59.378 --> 57:08.468
And She rises because She wants to give you
your second birth, but She is your individual

57:08.468 --> 57:09.468
mother.

57:09.468 --> 57:11.749
You don’t share Her with anybody else.

57:11.749 --> 57:16.558
Yours is a different, somebody else’s is
different.

57:16.558 --> 57:19.628
Because the tape-recording is different.

57:19.628 --> 57:21.628
And She knows everything about you.

57:21.628 --> 57:27.488
So, when She rises She does, goes very slowly,
without harming you, without troubling you

57:27.488 --> 57:33.998
and pierces through.

57:33.998 --> 57:50.228
We say She is the reflection of the Adi Shakti
who is called as Holy Ghost in the bible.

57:50.228 --> 57:57.118
But She rises without any difficulty.

57:57.118 --> 57:58.628
Hardly any time it takes.

57:58.628 --> 58:01.998
Would they like to have their Self Realisation?

58:01.998 --> 58:06.738
Sahaja Yogi: Shri Mataji asks if you would
like to experience this and have your Self

58:06.738 --> 58:07.738
Realisation?

58:07.738 --> 58:09.758
Very quick, very easy.

58:09.758 --> 58:12.778
Shri Mataji: Hardly any time.

58:12.778 --> 58:15.058
Now, you forget the past.

58:15.058 --> 58:20.238
Another thing you have to do is to forgive
yourself.

58:20.238 --> 58:21.238
And not to feel guilty about anything.

58:21.238 --> 58:33.228
Very important, because if you feel guilty
then this centre catches here on the left.

58:33.228 --> 58:40.378
When it catches here on the left you can get
spondylitis, you can also get angina.

58:40.378 --> 58:42.758
So why, why to feel guilty?

58:42.758 --> 58:46.158
Whatever has happened has happened, forget
everything.

58:46.158 --> 58:48.818
Not to feel guilty – very important.

58:48.818 --> 58:53.968
I know here people feel more guilty, not in
India.

58:53.968 --> 58:59.348
They never feel guilty.

58:59.348 --> 59:01.828
But in the west they do.

59:01.828 --> 59:06.058
But there’s no need, no need to condemn
yourself, you have to have great honour and

59:06.058 --> 59:19.138
love for yourself, because you are special
people and that you are going to help the

59:19.138 --> 59:22.048
whole world.

59:22.048 --> 59:26.428
So respect yourself!

59:26.428 --> 59:36.638
As I respect you and love you.

59:36.638 --> 59:45.388
You, please, respect and love yourself.

59:45.388 --> 59:46.848
Alright.

59:46.848 --> 59:56.018
Now, what you have to do is to put both the
hands towards me, like this, just like this,

59:56.018 --> 01:00:01.208
because I told you these are the endings of
the sympathetic nervous system.

01:00:01.208 --> 01:00:08.798
It’s like this – little open, like this.

01:00:08.798 --> 01:00:17.088
You don’t have to doubt yourself, by any
chance.

01:00:17.088 --> 01:00:19.888
Please, don’t doubt.

01:00:19.888 --> 01:00:32.388
Now, you put your left hand like this towards
me and right hand on top of your head here.

01:00:32.388 --> 01:00:39.018
On top, means away, not touching the head.

01:00:39.018 --> 01:00:46.488
You can bend your head and see for yourself.

01:00:46.488 --> 01:00:55.388
Now see, if there is a cool or a hot breeze
coming out of your fontanel bone area which

01:00:55.388 --> 01:00:58.848
was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:00:58.848 --> 01:01:07.098
Just see for yourself, if there’s a hot
or a cool breeze-like vibrations coming out

01:01:07.098 --> 01:01:13.848
of your fontanel bone area which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

01:01:13.848 --> 01:01:18.608
Now, you can move your hand and see for yourself.

01:01:18.608 --> 01:01:25.458
You can move it, sometimes you can feel it
higher, sometimes lower or on the sides.

01:01:25.458 --> 01:01:26.458
See for yourself.

01:01:26.458 --> 01:01:30.518
If it is hot that means, of course, you have
got your Realisation, but if it is hot that

01:01:30.518 --> 01:01:32.868
means you have not forgiven yourself.

01:01:32.868 --> 01:01:37.358
Or you have not forgiven others.

01:01:37.358 --> 01:01:48.138
So, please forgive others, also forgive yourself
fully.

01:01:48.138 --> 01:01:50.828
Please forgive.

01:01:50.828 --> 01:02:05.658
Now, please put your right hand towards me,
bend your head.

01:02:05.658 --> 01:02:18.288
And see for yourself if you have cool or hot
breeze-like vibrations coming out of your

01:02:18.288 --> 01:02:28.778
fontanel bone area which was the soft bone
in your childhood.

01:02:28.778 --> 01:02:33.838
Please try.

01:02:33.838 --> 01:02:54.078
Please bend your head and see for yourself.

01:02:54.078 --> 01:03:03.408
Now, please take down your hands, both hands
and put them towards me, like this.

01:03:03.408 --> 01:03:06.808
And don’t think.

01:03:06.808 --> 01:03:11.758
Just don’t think.

01:03:11.758 --> 01:03:25.698
Because I already told you, you have a right,
it’s your birthright to have this Yoga,

01:03:25.698 --> 01:03:27.678
union with the divine, it’s your birthright.

01:03:27.678 --> 01:03:47.788
Now, you have to put both your hands towards
the sky like this and push back your head

01:03:47.788 --> 01:03:59.588
and ask me – I’ll tell you about three,
three things, three questions you can say.

01:03:59.588 --> 01:04:03.968
You have to say one question three times,
only one of them.

01:04:03.968 --> 01:04:13.558
For example you can ask, you can call me Mother,
Mother – or Shri Mataji, whatever you like.

01:04:13.558 --> 01:04:18.418
Mother is, is this the cool breeze of the
Holy Ghost?

01:04:18.418 --> 01:04:24.308
Ask in your heart this question “Mother
is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

01:04:24.308 --> 01:04:25.308
Ask three times.

01:04:25.308 --> 01:04:32.038
Or, you can ask “Mother, is this the all-pervading
power of divine love?”

01:04:32.038 --> 01:04:39.198
Or you can ask third question “Mother, is
this the Paramachaitanya or Ruh?”

01:04:39.198 --> 01:04:46.228
Ask anyone of these questions, anyone of them,
three times.

01:04:46.228 --> 01:04:50.318
Now - let’s have it.

01:04:50.318 --> 01:04:59.508
Alright, please put down your hands again
and put them towards me.

01:04:59.508 --> 01:05:04.068
Please, don’t doubt, please don’t doubt.

01:05:04.068 --> 01:05:07.418
That’s something very important.

01:05:07.418 --> 01:05:18.808
If you start feeling a cool or a hot breeze
on your fingertips or on your palm, same or

01:05:18.808 --> 01:05:28.928
out of your fontanel bone area, out of your
head, anyone of them, then raise your both

01:05:28.928 --> 01:05:33.668
the hands, raise your both the hands – those
who have felt it that way.

01:05:33.668 --> 01:05:51.238
Those who have felt the cool breeze in their
hands.

01:05:51.238 --> 01:06:16.678
Thank you very much!

01:06:16.678 --> 01:06:37.188
Most of you have got it.

01:06:37.188 --> 01:06:38.188
Unbelievable…

01:06:38.188 --> 01:06:41.058
You got it?

01:06:41.058 --> 01:06:43.968
No – not yet?

01:06:43.968 --> 01:06:44.968
Alright.

01:06:44.968 --> 01:06:48.018
Who didn’t get it now?

01:06:48.018 --> 01:06:49.018
She also.

01:06:49.018 --> 01:06:50.018
You didn’t get it, madam?

01:06:50.018 --> 01:06:51.018
You got it?

01:06:51.018 --> 01:06:53.488
They can help you, let us see.

01:06:53.488 --> 01:06:55.658
You got it?

01:06:55.658 --> 01:06:59.278
You felt the cool breeze?

01:06:59.278 --> 01:07:04.418
Now – you felt it.

01:07:04.418 --> 01:07:12.818
Keep it like that.

01:07:12.818 --> 01:07:29.248
Let it flow as much as possible, is very good.

01:07:29.248 --> 01:07:36.208
You all can do this, it’s very simple.

01:07:36.208 --> 01:07:38.378
She has it now?

01:07:38.378 --> 01:07:41.398
Sahaja Yogi: It’s warm, Mother, it’s warm.

01:07:41.398 --> 01:07:43.128
Shri Mataji: It’s warm?

01:07:43.128 --> 01:07:51.968
Alright, put her left to the right.

01:07:51.968 --> 01:08:02.358
Raise her left.

01:08:02.358 --> 01:08:16.208
What’s she catching on?

01:08:16.208 --> 01:08:40.438
Sahaja Yogi: It’s left Vishuddhi, Shri Mataji.

01:08:40.438 --> 01:08:50.828
Shri Mataji: Left….

01:08:50.828 --> 01:09:01.218
Are you Bengali?

01:09:01.218 --> 01:09:21.988
Seeker: I am from the Caribbean.

01:09:21.988 --> 01:09:46.228
Shri Mataji: Now you just don’t think.

01:09:46.228 --> 01:09:54.798
That’s what you should practice a little
bit.

01:09:54.798 --> 01:10:00.748
Put your hands towards me, all of you and
don’t think.

01:10:00.748 --> 01:10:02.578
What is it?

01:10:02.578 --> 01:10:05.358
Did you feel the Kundalini?

01:10:05.358 --> 01:10:09.338
Are you feeling it on the head?

01:10:09.338 --> 01:10:15.728
Warm, so that’s it – put her left to the
right.

01:10:15.728 --> 01:10:19.118
Raise her left and put down the right.

01:10:19.118 --> 01:10:22.368
It has nothing to do with the air-condition.

01:10:22.368 --> 01:10:25.138
You feel it on your fingers – alright?

01:10:25.138 --> 01:10:26.138
Now better?

01:10:26.138 --> 01:10:27.138
Now alright?

01:10:27.138 --> 01:10:28.198
May God bless you!

01:10:28.198 --> 01:10:30.488
Just keep go on like that.

01:10:30.488 --> 01:10:31.488
Alright?

01:10:31.488 --> 01:10:32.488
Are you feeling?

01:10:32.488 --> 01:10:33.488
Cool or hot?

01:10:33.488 --> 01:10:34.488
Cool now?

01:10:34.488 --> 01:10:35.488
Now she’s got it.

01:10:35.488 --> 01:10:36.488
So, thank you very much!

01:10:36.488 --> 01:10:37.488
Thank you, all of you!

01:10:37.488 --> 01:10:38.488
May God bless you! (quietly)

01:10:38.488 --> 01:10:40.878
You have to practice now.

01:10:40.878 --> 01:11:52.758
Can you not tell them to come to some follow-up
or some program like that?
