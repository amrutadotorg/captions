00:00:02.626 --> 00:00:08.875
Today we have gathered here to do
Guru puja.

00:00:10.562 --> 00:00:13.837
This system started long time back
in India,

00:00:14.038 --> 00:00:19.020
I think even at the time of Patanjali,

00:00:19.221 --> 00:00:25.504
maybe even earlier, when there were
great seekers.

00:00:25.705 --> 00:00:32.100
And their gurus were sitting
in the jungles, where they used to get

00:00:33.634 --> 00:00:38.528
permission to go there and then
they would get their realisation,

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.600
very few of them, one or two.

00:00:41.801 --> 00:00:48.241
So we had many rishis and munis
in the olden times in India.

00:00:48.442 --> 00:00:52.242
So this system of guru started.

00:00:52.851 --> 00:01:00.809
Also one of the reasons is that, that there
is no organised religion in India.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:07.167
There’s no popes, there are no priests,
nothing like them.

00:01:07.368 --> 00:01:11.354
They have priests just for worshipping
in the temples.

00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:18.532
But for giving realisation, for talking
about higher life,

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:26.755
they all had to go to very great
realised souls.

00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:34.736
And it was absolutely the freedom of the
guru, whom to accept whom not to accept.

00:01:34.937 --> 00:01:40.319
And everybody was tested thoroughly
by the guru

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:47.733
if they are capable of achieving
Self-realisation or not.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:55.147
And this test was so hard, so difficult,

00:01:55.348 --> 00:02:03.630
and also to a point of cruelty, that very
few could pass through that test.

00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:08.718
It’s not like Sahaja Yoga, everybody is
a Sahaja Yogi, it’s not like that.

00:02:10.142 --> 00:02:17.323
That, of course, made it a very narrow
margin for people

00:02:17.524 --> 00:02:23.566
to achieve their realisation and these
gurus never used to leave

00:02:23.767 --> 00:02:27.324
their own seats, they call it takiya
(meaning: pillow).

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:31.378
They would be there in their own place,
all those who would like to go to him

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:38.644
could come. If he allowed, then only
they can meet him.

00:02:38.845 --> 00:02:41.764
You may go on for miles together, nothing,

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:46.253
no obligations of the guru that he should
meet you.

00:02:50.542 --> 00:02:59.715
Perhaps they didn’t feel that love and
compassion for the seekers.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:06.532
They didn’t understand that these seekers
are ardently seeking the truth

00:03:06.733 --> 00:03:09.780
and they should not suffer.

00:03:10.244 --> 00:03:16.607
That may be the reason they were not
so much concerned.

00:03:16.808 --> 00:03:20.563
All the time they were testing
their disciple.

00:03:20.764 --> 00:03:24.709
Even Ramdas, who was the guru of Shivaji,

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.290
was testing even Shivaji for so many times,

00:03:29.491 --> 00:03:32.543
though he was a born realised.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.036
So to get this Gurupada, to [the] position
of a guru,

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:49.021
after that they had to work very, very hard
to achieve a state of a saint.

00:03:51.583 --> 00:03:56.345
But in Sahaja Yoga that is not the case,
as you know.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.917
I just thought – if people get their
realisation,

00:04:01.118 --> 00:04:04.275
they’ll see for themselves what’s wrong
with them,

00:04:04.476 --> 00:04:10.177
they will introspect themselves and will
try to correct themselves.

00:04:10.378 --> 00:04:17.768
It is true, for many, many people, but some
of them still are lingering behind

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:22.157
and are going on and on and on thinking
that they are Sahaja Yogis,

00:04:22.358 --> 00:04:28.189
they have achieved a lot, they are
something very special.

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:33.187
So this delusion is all the time
is creating this problem.

00:04:33.388 --> 00:04:40.743
This delusion makes them very
narrow minded,

00:04:40.944 --> 00:04:49.384
selfish, self-centred, and people can’t
believe how can they be Sahaja Yogis.

00:04:52.102 --> 00:04:54.936
So the first and foremost thing we have
to know

00:04:55.137 --> 00:05:01.230
that this Sahaja Yoga has worked out
because Paramchaitanya

00:05:01.431 --> 00:05:06.095
is transmitting compassion. It never
did before.

00:05:06.296 --> 00:05:14.763
It never had that kind of an attitude
which it is there because I am a Mother.

00:05:14.964 --> 00:05:20.249
And this compassion has worked it this way
that: you all have got your realisation,

00:05:20.481 --> 00:05:25.962
you have achieved a state which we can
call as a Self-realised souls.

00:05:26.163 --> 00:05:33.298
But still, because you got it so easily,
cheaply,

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:38.745
I think, still we don’t realise what we
have got.

00:05:38.946 --> 00:05:49.178
Still we do not practice meditation,
introspection and dedication.

00:05:49.379 --> 00:05:52.706
Some are very much there,

00:05:52.907 --> 00:05:59.802
but mostly we are just living in the idea
that we have already achieved.

00:06:02.446 --> 00:06:06.840
So, the first thing we should introspect:

00:06:08.571 --> 00:06:13.155
Are we concerned about ourselves?

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:18.791
All the time do we think that we are
suffering,

00:06:18.992 --> 00:06:22.525
we have this problem, that problem,

00:06:22.726 --> 00:06:26.451
or this should be done, that should
be done.

00:06:26.652 --> 00:06:33.956
If the attention is on that, that all
the time you are worried about yourself,

00:06:35.694 --> 00:06:43.366
then you cannot break, you cannot break
through this shell of your being,

00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:53.078
which is under the domination of your
mental selfishness or self-centredness.

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:59.361
Even self-centredness is absolutely
against your growth.

00:06:59.562 --> 00:07:02.838
There are many people who come,
I have seen, even to Cabella,

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:06.693
I know they have to suffer a lot because
they think

00:07:06.894 --> 00:07:10.527
it’s a very open space where they have
to live

00:07:10.728 --> 00:07:14.444
and they must make all arrangements
to make themselves comfortable.

00:07:14.645 --> 00:07:17.405
Such people have to grow still much more.

00:07:17.606 --> 00:07:22.831
For a saint, any place has to be heavenly.

00:07:23.032 --> 00:07:28.067
You must have seen Me enjoying everything.

00:07:28.268 --> 00:07:34.326
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere.
I have no demands of any kind.

00:07:34.527 --> 00:07:42.439
But if you are worried about your body
comforts or your body troubles

00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:48.702
then still you are at a body level, which
you have to transcend.

00:07:48.903 --> 00:07:54.099
Worried about how you look, how you
dress up,

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:58.955
what sort of things you have to wear:

00:07:59.435 --> 00:08:06.439
all this makes you yet not a good
Sahaja Yogi.

00:08:09.542 --> 00:08:17.349
This is one style of Sahaja Yogis who
still want very great comforts.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:22.934
So, what you have to do, if you are used
to comforts:

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:27.213
try to go and sleep on the street.

00:08:27.615 --> 00:08:33.727
I will not do that, but you can do it.
Or sleep on a tree.

00:08:33.928 --> 00:08:37.426
You may fall down, doesn’t matter.

00:08:43.281 --> 00:08:47.608
Do all kinds of things that are necessary
to punish your body to understand

00:08:47.809 --> 00:08:52.834
that you are not bound with this comfort
of the body.

00:08:55.082 --> 00:08:58.825
This is one of the greatest things one
has to see,

00:08:59.026 --> 00:09:02.888
that you are not bound by your body.

00:09:03.089 --> 00:09:07.545
It’s alright - if you have comfort, well
and good, if you don’t have, well and good.

00:09:07.746 --> 00:09:14.913
For a Sahaja Yogi it is very important that
he should be able to live like a saint.

00:09:15.114 --> 00:09:19.260
Not necessarily that you should become
a sanyasi,

00:09:19.436 --> 00:09:28.256
but from inside your body should be such
that you can dominate your body.

00:09:28.457 --> 00:09:34.796
How can you not sleep anywhere?
Why can you not sleep anywhere?

00:09:36.313 --> 00:09:45.231
Then also, that they want to have a very
comfortable arrangements

00:09:45.432 --> 00:09:49.376
about bathrooms, this, that.

00:09:50.519 --> 00:09:55.453
All these ideas are there because you are
very self-conscious

00:09:55.654 --> 00:09:59.726
but not superconsciousness, it’s not there.

00:09:59.927 --> 00:10:02.583
You want to have everything first class,

00:10:02.784 --> 00:10:08.863
and anybody who tries to interfere with
that kind of a thing, you don’t like it.

00:10:09.064 --> 00:10:13.809
I can understand a person who is very old –
he cannot manage things,

00:10:14.010 --> 00:10:19.943
he has to have a certain amount
of body comfort,

00:10:20.144 --> 00:10:26.869
but even young people these days are
extremely comfort-oriented.

00:10:28.324 --> 00:10:31.402
That is not for Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:33.193 --> 00:10:38.482
Of course, I’ve seen people in the West
are better off in this matter.

00:10:38.683 --> 00:10:41.966
Because when they go to India they told Me
they like

00:10:42.167 --> 00:10:46.301
[Maharashtra] S.T. buses better than
comfortable buses.

00:10:46.502 --> 00:10:47.953
So I said, “Why?”

00:10:48.154 --> 00:10:53.066
“Because Mother, you can jump in the bus
nicely with all the luggage,”

00:10:53.267 --> 00:10:59.590
“Because the windows are open, you can
breathe. Very natural, very good”.

00:10:59.792 --> 00:11:04.998
And they wanted to go on bullock carts
also. I mean they enjoy all that.

00:11:05.199 --> 00:11:09.875
Actually if you see you'll notice,
in the Western World mostly,

00:11:10.076 --> 00:11:12.794
people are taking to [a] more rustic life.

00:11:12.995 --> 00:11:15.970
They are enjoying more the rustic style
of life

00:11:16.171 --> 00:11:19.719
than to this so-called comfortable,
artificial life.

00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:26.214
Not so much Indians, I would say,
also Malaysians.

00:11:26.415 --> 00:11:33.804
I think, most of the people I have met
in the Western countries are really great

00:11:34.005 --> 00:11:38.743
because they can sleep anywhere,
they can eat anything.

00:11:38.944 --> 00:11:44.829
You ask them, “How did you like the food?”
“What did we eat, I don’t know Mother?”

00:11:45.030 --> 00:11:49.666
That is the sign. That is the sign
of a person

00:11:49.867 --> 00:11:55.833
who is not bothered as to what he
is eating, what he’s getting,

00:11:56.034 --> 00:12:04.494
what is his taste, “I like this, I like
that,” these words drop out.

00:12:05.574 --> 00:12:09.271
It’s not difficult, it’s not difficult,

00:12:09.472 --> 00:12:13.812
you might think that I am asking you to do
something, hazardous thing, you see.

00:12:14.013 --> 00:12:18.629
It’s not difficult at all. Because if you
have to impress

00:12:18.830 --> 00:12:23.194
the people around, you have to be
like a saint.

00:12:23.395 --> 00:12:28.268
And if you are a fussy person, if you are
a fusspot,

00:12:28.469 --> 00:12:34.971
then you cannot impress others that you
have got Self-realisation.

00:12:35.172 --> 00:12:38.158
Many people tell Me, “Mother, people
had to do so much:

00:12:38.359 --> 00:12:43.566
to go to Himalayas, do this, do that,
and then they got their realisation.

00:12:43.767 --> 00:12:49.318
How is it these people you have blessed?”
Even some great saints asked Me that.

00:12:49.519 --> 00:12:52.975
“What right they had to get this
realisation?

00:12:53.176 --> 00:12:56.778
Why did you give them realisation?
What have they achieved?”

00:12:56.979 --> 00:12:59.354
I said, “Only their desire.

00:12:59.555 --> 00:13:03.624
Their desire was very much there that
they should get their Self-realisation

00:13:03.825 --> 00:13:06.994
and that’s how they got it”.

00:13:07.261 --> 00:13:15.568
But now to go into only desire,
is not sufficient.

00:13:15.769 --> 00:13:18.821
You have to depend on your Self,

00:13:19.022 --> 00:13:23.253
on the light of your Spirit you should see
what’s wrong with you.

00:13:23.454 --> 00:13:28.178
This is a very important thing.
Ask questions to yourself.

00:13:28.379 --> 00:13:34.383
“Why do I want this? Why do I need this?
What is the purpose?”

00:13:34.584 --> 00:13:38.763
Because as you have seen, all the rest
of the world is mad,

00:13:38.964 --> 00:13:46.252
[we] call it mad, because they are
running after stupid things,

00:13:46.453 --> 00:13:52.259
they are wanting things which
has no meaning to spirituality.

00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:57.160
So spirituality itself should be
self-satisfying.

00:13:57.361 --> 00:14:01.687
If you are spiritually endowed, then you
are self-satisfied.

00:14:01.888 --> 00:14:07.993
And this self-satisfaction within you
will lead you

00:14:08.193 --> 00:14:12.755
to that Ocean of Joy about which
I have been telling you

00:14:12.956 --> 00:14:17.307
and all the Scriptures have described.

00:14:18.238 --> 00:14:24.333
For Sahaja Yogis, the word we use
is Nirananda.

00:14:24.534 --> 00:14:32.179
Nirananda means: A joyous state, where
nothing is needed.

00:14:32.584 --> 00:14:37.612
Joy itself is joy. You are enjoying
only joy.

00:14:37.813 --> 00:14:40.894
Nothing is needed to make you happy.

00:14:41.095 --> 00:14:48.689
You are happy because of joy that you have,
in the Nirananda state.

00:14:49.264 --> 00:14:55.758
If you go and see how these saints lived,
you will be amazed.

00:14:55.959 --> 00:15:01.144
How they managed their life, you’ll be
very much amazed.

00:15:01.345 --> 00:15:04.474
How many days they used to fast,
without food.

00:15:04.675 --> 00:15:07.048
Never bothered! They never thought
it was fasting.

00:15:07.249 --> 00:15:11.650
They just used to think, “We have no food,
so no, don’t eat.”

00:15:12.269 --> 00:15:16.582
Of course, you don’t have to go through
[that], you have got your realisation.

00:15:16.783 --> 00:15:21.890
So now you have a power to achieve
this mastery.

00:15:22.091 --> 00:15:24.719
Now you have this power.

00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.566
The another thing I have noticed
about Sahaja Yogis,

00:15:29.767 --> 00:15:35.430
some of them have grudges about others.

00:15:35.691 --> 00:15:39.648
Sahaja Yoga is

00:15:41.903 --> 00:15:50.954
the blessings of love, blessings
of compassion.

00:15:51.477 --> 00:15:56.502
There is no place for any kind of hatred,

00:15:56.703 --> 00:16:05.008
or any kind of revenge, or anger
among Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:06.334 --> 00:16:10.089
If you have that, you must conquer it.

00:16:10.290 --> 00:16:17.340
Is a good chance, if you find somebody
who is very hot-tempered,

00:16:17.711 --> 00:16:23.815
who is a very angry type, go and make
friends with that person.

00:16:24.016 --> 00:16:27.793
Just see if you can carry on with that
person or not.

00:16:27.994 --> 00:16:32.763
If there’s a fusspot, also make friends
with such a fusspot,

00:16:32.964 --> 00:16:40.155
and see that you achieve that peace

00:16:40.356 --> 00:16:44.155
which will keep you above all kinds
of hatred,

00:16:44.356 --> 00:16:49.037
all kinds of temper, which is a very
bad thing.

00:16:49.238 --> 00:16:52.438
But some Sahaja Yogis lose their temper
very fast.

00:16:52.639 --> 00:16:55.286
I would say they cannot be Sahaja Yogis,

00:16:55.487 --> 00:17:00.414
because if you have no control over
your anger,

00:17:00.615 --> 00:17:06.270
then how are you powerful of compassion
and love?

00:17:06.471 --> 00:17:10.952
But you don’t even have to control it –
just there.

00:17:11.153 --> 00:17:16.554
Once you have it, you have that state,
then you just watch and see.

00:17:16.893 --> 00:17:25.249
In the olden days, the saints, mostly, used
to be very much angry type people.

00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:29.043
They couldn’t bear the stupidity
of the world

00:17:29.244 --> 00:17:35.174
and they used to be very, very angry type
and they used to run away from people.

00:17:35.375 --> 00:17:41.736
I know of a saint, Nityanandswami, who
always lived on the tree,

00:17:41.937 --> 00:17:45.733
and anybody tried to come near him,
he used to throw stones at him.

00:17:45.934 --> 00:17:53.042
Couldn’t bear people who were all
heated up and coming to him.

00:17:53.243 --> 00:17:58.337
But you don’t need that. You have a way
of achieving

00:17:58.538 --> 00:18:05.386
love and affection of the people who seem
to be very, very troublesome

00:18:05.587 --> 00:18:10.585
and grudging type or maybe some people
who are very aggressive.

00:18:10.786 --> 00:18:16.347
This is not a difficult task if you try
a little bit the other way round.

00:18:16.564 --> 00:18:21.106
Mostly people, when they find somebody
who is a very hot-tempered person,

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:25.782
they run away from them. «We don’t want
to have anything to do [with them]».

00:18:25.983 --> 00:18:34.637
Those who are not hot-tempered, those
who are good natured,

00:18:34.858 --> 00:18:39.328
you can always be friendly, what is
so great about it?

00:18:40.413 --> 00:18:50.685
What is so nice about it?
What is so sweet about it?

00:18:51.754 --> 00:18:56.939
But how you speak to the person, how you
talk to that person,

00:18:57.139 --> 00:19:04.709
how you manage that person: your love
will definitely melt him down,

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:09.429
because he’s a Sahaja Yogi, I’m not saying
for non-sahaja yogis.

00:19:09.630 --> 00:19:15.431
Sahaja Yogis as they are, you have
to be extremely

00:19:15.632 --> 00:19:20.526
compassionate and affectionate
and love.

00:19:23.639 --> 00:19:28.911
The another thing which is extremely
important for us to know,

00:19:29.112 --> 00:19:34.527
that we have got this realisation
through Mother’s love.

00:19:34.728 --> 00:19:37.415
Only My compassion has acted,

00:19:37.616 --> 00:19:41.838
only the power of Mother’s compassion
could have worked it out.

00:19:42.039 --> 00:19:48.038
Now, even if this love is flowing towards
the stones,

00:19:48.239 --> 00:19:55.182
or towards the mountains, or towards
anything which is very solid,

00:19:55.383 --> 00:20:00.396
the ripples come back, they have
to come back.

00:20:00.597 --> 00:20:04.506
In the same way, you people now,
who have got realisation,

00:20:04.707 --> 00:20:08.037
have to know that compassion and love

00:20:08.238 --> 00:20:12.712
is the only power you have got,
nothing else.

00:20:14.047 --> 00:20:19.028
If you love yourself, you care
for yourself,

00:20:19.229 --> 00:20:23.650
you care for your family and care
for your children –

00:20:23.851 --> 00:20:27.287
then you haven’t achieved much.

00:20:27.488 --> 00:20:30.882
You are only worried about yourself,

00:20:31.083 --> 00:20:35.472
because that’s your limited area
where you move.

00:20:35.673 --> 00:20:43.961
But if you can break that and find out
places

00:20:44.162 --> 00:20:50.113
where you have to express your love,
you can.

00:20:50.314 --> 00:20:53.396
As they say, the water finds it’s own
level.

00:20:53.597 --> 00:20:58.938
In the same way, this compassion has
to flow to all the places,

00:20:59.139 --> 00:21:04.575
to all the ditches everywhere,
and should find its own level.

00:21:04.776 --> 00:21:11.569
But if you are just satisfied with yourself
and you are not bothered,

00:21:11.770 --> 00:21:20.590
you are just trying to believe that you are
a great soul because you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:21:20.791 --> 00:21:25.718
then I must say that you are sadly
mistaken.

00:21:25.919 --> 00:21:30.110
In this lifetime you can achieve
that state.

00:21:30.311 --> 00:21:38.530
In this lifetime you can get to that state
within yourself.

00:21:38.731 --> 00:21:42.237
Now, the third thing that troubles
Sahaja Yogis is that

00:21:42.438 --> 00:21:47.922
“Mother, we want God’s realisation,”
that makes Me laugh.

00:21:48.123 --> 00:21:54.343
You see, it is already there, already
there.

00:21:54.544 --> 00:21:56.951
Like once you get into the sea

00:21:57.152 --> 00:21:59.446
and you say, “Mother, we want to go
to the bottom of the sea,”

00:21:59.647 --> 00:22:04.369
you can always go, just slip,
and you will be there.

00:22:04.570 --> 00:22:12.435
In the same way, once you have developed
a kind of a Self-realisation

00:22:12.636 --> 00:22:17.510
and have jumped into the Ocean
of this compassion,

00:22:17.711 --> 00:22:20.639
there’s no need to achieve anything.

00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:24.426
The sense of achievement, “I should be
that, I should be this,”

00:22:24.627 --> 00:22:29.084
is all coming from your human haunting.

00:22:29.285 --> 00:22:32.414
That should be over. Now you are
Godly people.

00:22:32.615 --> 00:22:37.124
So you should not think, “I should achieve
this state, I should achieve that state,”

00:22:37.325 --> 00:22:42.968
but just go on slipping, just giving up all
the weights that you have in your heads

00:22:43.176 --> 00:22:49.466
and it will work out. This is what I have
been saying to you that:

00:22:49.927 --> 00:22:56.834
you have to dissolve yourself
into the compassion.

00:22:57.059 --> 00:23:04.126
Also, there are still some very people
who want to be in the front.

00:23:04.483 --> 00:23:09.852
Specially Indians will all sit together
in front, I’ve seen that way.

00:23:10.053 --> 00:23:15.927
They have no right, they have no right
to sit in front.

00:23:16.128 --> 00:23:22.525
Nobody has right to sit in front or to seek
a place.

00:23:22.726 --> 00:23:30.647
They should sit wherever they get seat
to sit down with complete satisfaction.

00:23:31.512 --> 00:23:35.409
Whether you sit in front or at that corner,
even in the darkness,

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:41.103
you can get My vibrations, you can get
everything.

00:23:41.304 --> 00:23:49.231
So to be prominent, to sit some place where
you are prominent, is not necessary.

00:23:50.652 --> 00:23:54.378
What is it in a prominence, what do
you get?

00:23:54.586 --> 00:24:03.450
To be lost into the crowds, to be lost
into the Ocean of Love is the main thing.

00:24:04.699 --> 00:24:11.427
All these are mythical that, we should
somehow or other get the front place.

00:24:11.627 --> 00:24:17.778
You see as Marathi apan manto (We say),
“Samor chi zaaga patkauli mi!”

00:24:22.521 --> 00:24:27.053
means “I have managed to get the front
seat!”

00:24:27.254 --> 00:24:33.623
Front will be the back, and back will be
the front.

00:24:33.919 --> 00:24:39.809
It is very surprising how still people
are trying

00:24:40.027 --> 00:24:44.568
to achieve something so nonsensical.

00:24:44.861 --> 00:24:50.238
So where is your mind, where is your
attention, what are you thinking?

00:24:50.439 --> 00:24:55.866
If you are thoughtless you'll be satisfied,
you'll be happy,

00:24:56.067 --> 00:25:00.979
you'll not ask for anything, you’ll not
want anything.

00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:06.663
What is there to have? What is
so important?

00:25:08.170 --> 00:25:12.326
All these ideas come from ignorance, I must
tell you, is from ignorance.

00:25:12.527 --> 00:25:16.063
Once this ‘Hare Rama Hare Krishna’ fellow
came to Me.

00:25:16.263 --> 00:25:20.839
And he said that, “We have heard you
are a great saint,

00:25:21.040 --> 00:25:24.950
this thing, that thing, and you have
all the comforts of life –

00:25:25.151 --> 00:25:29.513
you have everything here, very nice,
this thing, that thing.

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.053
So, how are you a saint?”
I said, “How are you a saint?”

00:25:35.254 --> 00:25:41.558
[He said,] “I have given up my family,
I have given up my cars,

00:25:41.766 --> 00:25:47.784
I have given up my house, I have given up
my children.”

00:25:48.412 --> 00:25:53.457
I said, “One more thing you have given up”,
he said, “What?” “Your brains!”

00:26:02.693 --> 00:26:05.185
So they said, “But how do you say we have
given up our brains?”

00:26:05.386 --> 00:26:12.070
I said, “Very simple, I’ve given up
nothing, because I am holding nothing.

00:26:12.271 --> 00:26:16.177
What is there to give up when you are
not holding anything?

00:26:16.378 --> 00:26:21.799
Now, I would say in this house,
or on my body, anywhere,

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:26.782
[if] you think you can find anything equal
to the dust particle

00:26:26.983 --> 00:26:35.438
of Shri Krishna, you can take it.
Should be equal though.”

00:26:35.639 --> 00:26:38.726
Now they started looking here and there.

00:26:38.927 --> 00:26:44.835
I said, “Then what have you given up?
Just stones! What have you given up?

00:26:45.036 --> 00:26:48.827
Why are you boasting about giving up that,
and giving up this and giving up…?”

00:26:49.028 --> 00:26:53.560
They even shaved their head. What is it?

00:26:53.761 --> 00:26:59.649
All these useless ideas that, “We have done
this, we have done that.”

00:26:59.854 --> 00:27:03.120
Anybody in Sahaja Yoga who thinks he
is doing a lot of work for Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:03.321 --> 00:27:06.997
should give up completely.

00:27:08.595 --> 00:27:11.840
That’s the sign of another ignorance.

00:27:12.041 --> 00:27:15.896
If you are part and parcel of the Ocean,

00:27:16.097 --> 00:27:19.468
everything is done by Ocean, you are
doing nothing.

00:27:19.669 --> 00:27:27.748
To have such ideas about yourself shows
how little you know about yourself.

00:27:27.949 --> 00:27:32.884
You are the Ocean. Now, if you are
the Ocean how can you claim,

00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:37.392
“I have touched this shore, I have touched
that shore, I have touched this shore”?

00:27:37.593 --> 00:27:42.601
No more “I” is left. Once this I-ness
drops out,

00:27:42.802 --> 00:27:48.818
then only the Universal Being within you
shines.

00:27:50.040 --> 00:28:00.873
All these things are so clearly evident
in our characters.

00:28:01.055 --> 00:28:07.341
Some people are very identified, say
with their country,

00:28:07.542 --> 00:28:13.630
or maybe with their worshipping style,
whatever it is.

00:28:13.831 --> 00:28:18.554
All these misidentifications have to be
given up.

00:28:18.755 --> 00:28:22.266
It’s very difficult for people because
they are so conditioned.

00:28:22.467 --> 00:28:28.478
And as long as you have conditioning
you cannot rise above your mind,

00:28:28.679 --> 00:28:32.354
which is a myth, you cannot.

00:28:32.570 --> 00:28:37.575
Now, try to understand what are
your conditionings are.

00:28:41.947 --> 00:28:46.063
One of them, I would say, I have seen
and I am so surprised,

00:28:46.264 --> 00:28:53.353
you go to the Western countries, all
of them only sing songs of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:53.554 --> 00:28:55.586
They know all the songs of Shri Ganesha,

00:28:55.787 --> 00:29:01.308
Shri Ganesha’s photographs, Shri Ganesha’s
everything, children also.

00:29:01.545 --> 00:29:04.293
And now I have seen that vibrations stop!

00:29:04.494 --> 00:29:08.240
Why should they stop? Why should Ganesha
stop the vibrations?

00:29:08.441 --> 00:29:11.280
Why they are doing it, I realised, was
because I said

00:29:11.481 --> 00:29:14.762
Shri Ganesha incarnated as Christ.

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:21.500
Their identification is with Christ and
Christianity, in a very subtle way.

00:29:24.211 --> 00:29:30.537
So all the vibrations stopped! Imagine
with Shri Ganesha’s music, we heard

00:29:30.738 --> 00:29:36.624
in one of the Eastern Block countries,
and all the vibrations had stopped

00:29:36.825 --> 00:29:40.311
and they were singing all the songs,
all the songs of Shri Ganesha,

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:50.205
not one song of Sahaja Yoga, leave alone
about the Guru, not one song.

00:29:50.887 --> 00:29:57.378
So, even this, there is a very subtle,
subtle identification.

00:29:57.579 --> 00:30:06.724
There was one fellow in Russia, supposed
to be very intelligent,

00:30:06.925 --> 00:30:11.248
he said that, “Alright, if we keep Mother’s
photograph and also the icons,

00:30:11.449 --> 00:30:16.962
we can get the same type of vibrations.”
You cannot,

00:30:17.493 --> 00:30:22.235
because icons are made by some artist’s
imaginary.

00:30:22.436 --> 00:30:24.927
These are not representing actually

00:30:25.128 --> 00:30:29.783
even Maria or Christ or anyone, they are
all, all imaginary.

00:30:29.984 --> 00:30:35.708
If Italian ones makes Christ, he is
Italian style,

00:30:35.909 --> 00:30:41.414
if somebody - French one makes, he is
thin like [a] Frenchman,

00:30:41.631 --> 00:30:49.972
if you get somebody, say from Holland,
he'll have a forehead like that.

00:30:50.667 --> 00:30:57.312
You see all of them, they depict Christ
as they want to.

00:30:57.552 --> 00:31:05.054
Then we have Maria the same way.
Her expression, her photograph, everything,

00:31:05.262 --> 00:31:09.224
is all according to the imagination
of the artist

00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:14.673
and to whatever country he belongs,
that he will do.

00:31:14.874 --> 00:31:18.023
And they are not free, you can see,
they are not free,

00:31:18.224 --> 00:31:22.527
because all these artists have a certain
style.

00:31:22.728 --> 00:31:26.133
Now if it is Rembrandt, it’s a style,

00:31:26.334 --> 00:31:30.339
if it is, say Leonardo, it’s a style.

00:31:30.540 --> 00:31:34.569
Though they are born realised, still
they have a style. Nobody is like this,

00:31:34.770 --> 00:31:39.687
that he’ll make today like this, tomorrow
like this: there’s no freedom.

00:31:40.028 --> 00:31:44.151
They are bound by their own styles.

00:31:45.246 --> 00:31:50.560
Everybody has one style, and that is
the style they follow.

00:31:50.761 --> 00:31:58.003
Because, what is the reason? Reason is,
they must have done 3, 4 types of styles,

00:31:58.203 --> 00:32:03.323
must have done, sure, but people must
have rejected,

00:32:03.530 --> 00:32:09.379
“This is no good, this is no good.” So
it's all, you see, opinion of the people.

00:32:09.580 --> 00:32:13.251
So they must have taken to one style:
alright, this is the style.

00:32:13.452 --> 00:32:20.088
So you can see Christ if he’s Japanese,
he’ll have chinky eyes,

00:32:21.794 --> 00:32:25.967
if he’s Chinese, he’ll have no nose,

00:32:26.848 --> 00:32:33.221
if it’s Indian, he’ll be dark. So all kinds
of Christs I have seen

00:32:33.422 --> 00:32:39.703
and I feel that, how can they emit
vibrations? Tell Me.

00:32:41.068 --> 00:32:43.807
While with My photograph, how can you
compare?

00:32:44.008 --> 00:32:49.767
Also, cameras were to be developed at this
time: do you notice that point?

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:55.024
Cameras were developed at this time,
not before that.

00:32:55.224 --> 00:32:59.943
This loudspeaker was not developed
before this.

00:33:00.144 --> 00:33:05.504
Aeroplanes were not developed before.
I have been travelling for 19 days,

00:33:05.705 --> 00:33:10.312
one day in the plane, second day
in the public programme.

00:33:10.513 --> 00:33:15.774
They could not do all that. Nobody could
do this.

00:33:15.974 --> 00:33:19.039
Neither Shri Krishna, nor anyone.

00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:24.080
They could not fly by aeroplane
in those days.

00:33:24.281 --> 00:33:28.397
Now we say we have 65 countries, somebody
says there’s “No, 68 countries”

00:33:28.598 --> 00:33:34.279
or go on correcting. But is only possible
because today, today:

00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:39.033
there are aeroplanes. They were never
there [before].

00:33:39.234 --> 00:33:46.019
So all these things are – even video, even
the way you are seeing My image there,

00:33:46.180 --> 00:33:50.190
was that available before? No.

00:33:51.891 --> 00:33:58.683
So this is a very special time, where
science has also supported

00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.319
seekers to find the Truth – science
has supported.

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.477
We have to be thankful to science:

00:34:05.646 --> 00:34:10.213
that part of science which has been
so much supportive.

00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:16.034
Even [if] there was not a car, I could not
have gone up to Milan even!

00:34:16.455 --> 00:34:21.032
Imagine going on a bullock cart, what would
have happened to Me?

00:34:22.552 --> 00:34:28.095
So all these things are created today
for you.

00:34:28.296 --> 00:34:34.481
You were also born in those times
for this special reason.

00:34:34.682 --> 00:34:41.372
They could not give realisation because
that time you were not there.

00:34:42.057 --> 00:34:44.880
Very few people of your calibre were there.

00:34:45.081 --> 00:34:47.841
But I wonder if you understand
your calibre.

00:34:48.042 --> 00:34:54.259
The way you are sometimes growing,

00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:58.600
shows that you don’t understand
your calibre.

00:34:58.801 --> 00:35:00.972
You don’t know what you are,

00:35:01.173 --> 00:35:06.914
how much the whole atmosphere has
worked out for you,

00:35:07.115 --> 00:35:13.481
the science has been worked out for you.
Science is a gift of the nature.

00:35:13.682 --> 00:35:17.124
All this has been worked out for you

00:35:17.325 --> 00:35:24.137
to achieve the highest state
in the shortest time.

00:35:24.470 --> 00:35:32.771
But for that, one has to be extremely
introspective.

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:38.713
Instead of thinking of what you have
to achieve: be introspective.

00:35:38.914 --> 00:35:47.342
This introspection will help you and you
will really become real gurus.

00:35:47.543 --> 00:35:54.520
When you go to other villages, other
places, other cities,

00:35:54.721 --> 00:36:00.787
people should know from your being itself
that some great person has come.

00:36:01.684 --> 00:36:06.485
You don’t have to tell, you don’t have
to certify,

00:36:06.686 --> 00:36:13.024
it’s the simplicity of your temperament
itself.

00:36:13.224 --> 00:36:19.432
First time I went to Leningrad, nobody
knew about Me.

00:36:19.633 --> 00:36:26.684
No advertisements, nothing. They just
put some posters, some.

00:36:26.885 --> 00:36:30.658
And there were 2000 people in the hall,
2000 outside.

00:36:30.859 --> 00:36:36.217
In the hall they had to pay, alright.
I was wondering what’s the matter.

00:36:36.418 --> 00:36:42.376
And when I came out I gave them realisation
but I said, “You come tomorrow“.

00:36:42.577 --> 00:36:48.238
So 2000 from inside and 2000 from outside
and about 2000 more came,

00:36:48.439 --> 00:36:52.159
and were all were sitting on the ground.

00:36:52.444 --> 00:36:58.850
I was amazed. I said, “What made you come
to My programme?”

00:36:59.791 --> 00:37:03.874
[They] said, “Mother, so obvious,
Your photograph!”

00:37:04.074 --> 00:37:11.485
Such sensitivity of spirituality:
“So obvious, from Your photograph!”

00:37:11.686 --> 00:37:14.034
And they were scientists, they were
doctors,

00:37:14.235 --> 00:37:16.914
they were all kinds of intelligent people.

00:37:17.123 --> 00:37:21.937
But they could feel the spirituality
from the face.

00:37:24.323 --> 00:37:28.791
That kind of a sensitivity we should have.

00:37:28.992 --> 00:37:31.285
When you don’t need any discretion,
nothing, you know:

00:37:31.486 --> 00:37:34.535
this is this, this is this, this
is this.

00:37:34.736 --> 00:37:38.978
Don’t have to judge, don’t have to think
about it.

00:37:40.811 --> 00:37:48.538
You cannot say who will be best fitted
for this:

00:37:48.739 --> 00:37:52.244
those who have come for the first time,
those who have come later on,

00:37:52.445 --> 00:38:00.468
or those who will be coming, younger
or older, women, men or children.

00:38:00.999 --> 00:38:03.637
It is there.

00:38:04.809 --> 00:38:09.584
In my lifetime if I see so many of you,
so much transformed,

00:38:09.785 --> 00:38:16.104
looking so beautiful, so nice, creating
such a good atmosphere.

00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:19.263
It’s more than satisfaction for Me.

00:38:19.464 --> 00:38:24.563
And sometimes I think I - there is nothing
to be done now anymore – finished.

00:38:24.764 --> 00:38:30.737
But then they invite Me here, and invite Me
there, so I’m just doing.

00:38:30.938 --> 00:38:33.779
But to be very frank I am over satisfied.

00:38:33.980 --> 00:38:39.062
Now, once you have planted the tree…
it’s like a mango tree.

00:38:39.263 --> 00:38:44.373
Once you have planted the mango tree
and looked after it for 3 - 4 years,

00:38:44.581 --> 00:38:47.642
then it looks after itself.

00:38:48.179 --> 00:38:53.475
It gives fruits, it doesn’t need any water,
nothing, it just grows by itself.

00:38:53.676 --> 00:39:00.468
In the same way it should happen with you.
You should grow by yourself.

00:39:01.444 --> 00:39:05.690
Of course, you will find people who are
stupid, who are aggressive,

00:39:05.899 --> 00:39:10.061
who are not at all Sahaja Yogis

00:39:10.262 --> 00:39:12.747
and trying to be Sahaja Yogis.
You’ll find all kinds.

00:39:12.948 --> 00:39:18.154
So just see them, that’s all.

00:39:21.095 --> 00:39:33.286
In this Guru puja, you have to decide
that what are the criteria.

00:39:33.487 --> 00:39:42.294
First a Guru has to be without desires,
any desires whatsoever:

00:39:44.625 --> 00:39:50.277
Nirichcha, as they say. There is one
false guru in India

00:39:50.478 --> 00:39:53.903
who said that, “If I had the powers
as Mother has,

00:39:54.104 --> 00:39:58.194
then I would have become the king
of this world.”

00:39:58.395 --> 00:40:02.301
So people said, “Then why don’t you
become?”

00:40:02.502 --> 00:40:07.520
“Why doesn’t Mother become like that?
Why doesn’t She become the king?”

00:40:07.721 --> 00:40:10.828
So they said, “Because She is Nirichcha -
means She has no desires.

00:40:11.029 --> 00:40:15.315
A person who has no desires will not
become anything.”

00:40:15.516 --> 00:40:21.690
So I said go and tell him, “If you have
desires, you cannot have powers also.”

00:40:23.180 --> 00:40:28.425
It’s only because you have no desires,
that’s why all these powers are there.

00:40:28.626 --> 00:40:34.141
So any desire that comes into your mind,
you should say, “Ah, forget it.

00:40:37.331 --> 00:40:39.112
Just forget it.”

00:40:39.313 --> 00:40:47.310
When the desire is overpowering,
you just divert your attention.

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:52.097
Any kind of stupid desire can take charge

00:40:52.298 --> 00:41:01.254
and how do you become desireless is
by getting to the thoughtless awareness.

00:41:01.454 --> 00:41:04.344
Any crisis comes in, you should be
able to rise

00:41:04.545 --> 00:41:10.129
into that state of thoughtless awareness.
Just be peaceful.

00:41:10.768 --> 00:41:14.536
Look at your desires with peace.

00:41:14.737 --> 00:41:17.695
You can tell the desire, “Oh, I’m very
much satisfied, now don’t come,

00:41:17.896 --> 00:41:20.474
I don’t want.”

00:41:22.073 --> 00:41:26.613
That’s how you can become desireless.

00:41:26.931 --> 00:41:32.815
There is this compassion, and
the compassion

00:41:33.016 --> 00:41:39.407
that becomes actually the power.

00:41:40.621 --> 00:41:48.091
[With] small, small things you can express
your love, very small, small things.

00:41:48.527 --> 00:41:53.328
In very sweet ways you can express
your love.

00:41:53.804 --> 00:41:59.497
Is very important. The whole world needs
today love and peace.

00:41:59.698 --> 00:42:06.720
And you have to give peace and love
to everyone that is possible.

00:42:06.921 --> 00:42:11.493
Of course [with] Sahaja Yogis [it] is
very easy, but even non-sahaja yogis,

00:42:11.694 --> 00:42:15.838
you must treat them with respect and love.

00:42:16.295 --> 00:42:23.680
But you should not have a desire that
you should get back anything from them.

00:42:23.881 --> 00:42:26.430
It’s alright, whatever done, is forgotten.

00:42:26.631 --> 00:42:30.431
You have known so many Sahaja Yogis who
came to Sahaja Yoga, have gained so much

00:42:30.632 --> 00:42:36.413
and have betrayed us – [it] doesn’t matter,
[it’s] not important.

00:42:36.633 --> 00:42:42.712
Because they are going to be losers,
not we.

00:42:43.339 --> 00:42:47.572
So, there’s nothing to bother about
these things.

00:42:47.773 --> 00:42:53.697
Then another thing is: try to see that
your mind doesn’t react.

00:42:53.898 --> 00:42:59.804
Some people have a habit, or I think most
of them have, to react.

00:43:00.195 --> 00:43:07.197
You tell them something, they’ll put their
own one tail with it, something.

00:43:07.587 --> 00:43:12.146
Never will they accept if somebody
says something.

00:43:12.347 --> 00:43:16.739
If you are reacting, what will go into
your heads? What will go into your heart?

00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:20.077
What will go into your attention?

00:43:21.427 --> 00:43:29.315
So the reaction itself is a sign of not
proper development within yourself.

00:43:29.516 --> 00:43:34.102
This attention which is trying to go
into all the areas of your mind

00:43:34.303 --> 00:43:39.159
and your body and everywhere, is not there.

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:47.919
It cannot enter, because as soon as
it tries to enter, you shut it by reacting.

00:43:48.496 --> 00:43:53.714
You cannot see anything just for seeing
sake, you must react.

00:43:53.915 --> 00:43:57.712
You say, “This is not good, that’s not
good.”

00:43:58.235 --> 00:44:04.911
If I say, “It's 5 o’clock”, you’ll say,
“No, it is 5 past, 2 minutes, 3 seconds.”

00:44:06.947 --> 00:44:12.373
This comes with terrible conditioning
which has to go away.

00:44:12.574 --> 00:44:17.499
Not to react. Why should you react?

00:44:18.402 --> 00:44:24.288
Then the argument starts, then fight
starts, then wars come in.

00:44:25.693 --> 00:44:27.531
If you tell your mind,

00:44:27.732 --> 00:44:32.980
“Nothing doing, you are a myth and I am
not going to react to anything!”

00:44:33.472 --> 00:44:38.144
99. 9% problems will be solved.

00:44:44.072 --> 00:44:48.432
Then the last, but not the least is
the ego.

00:44:49.282 --> 00:44:56.695
I can’t understand a saint having a ego,
just can’t understand.

00:45:01.290 --> 00:45:05.924
It’s so stupid to have ego.

00:45:06.125 --> 00:45:13.380
It’s a kind of a domination, if slightest
things are wrong, you get angry.

00:45:14.452 --> 00:45:17.421
If somebody says something, you get angry.

00:45:17.622 --> 00:45:24.050
That means your power of love and
compassion is still not full.

00:45:27.231 --> 00:45:32.377
You can, of course, correct people
when they have to be corrected,

00:45:32.578 --> 00:45:37.515
but for that you should have this power
within yourself.

00:45:37.716 --> 00:45:40.656
The person should know that you are
correcting that person

00:45:40.857 --> 00:45:48.287
because you love that person,
not for selfishness, not for any gain.

00:45:48.488 --> 00:45:53.098
But this ego is a very big problem
and that comes up

00:45:53.299 --> 00:46:03.052
by, I should say, not only ignorance
but stupid ideas about yourself.

00:46:05.083 --> 00:46:12.299
If you think you are something great,
already, then what can you do?

00:46:13.294 --> 00:46:18.724
Ego makes you very arrogant, horrible.

00:46:18.925 --> 00:46:24.545
But if you are humble, really, not to just
to have the humility of a businessman,

00:46:24.714 --> 00:46:28.825
but if you are humble from within yourself,

00:46:29.026 --> 00:46:34.868
from your heart, enjoying your humility,

00:46:36.530 --> 00:46:39.605
then this ego can run away.

00:46:39.806 --> 00:46:43.369
You have to ask yourself, “Now what
are you angry for?”

00:46:43.570 --> 00:46:48.274
Again I come back to the same point:
introspection.

00:46:48.451 --> 00:46:52.488
Because you are not here just to carry on
some jobs,

00:46:52.689 --> 00:46:57.569
but you are here to become saints.

00:46:58.411 --> 00:47:08.372
Then this ego should be made into a great
instrument of love and joy.

00:47:08.573 --> 00:47:11.518
You can, it's not difficult.

00:47:11.719 --> 00:47:19.684
This one is what is ego is, reactions
to things.

00:47:20.084 --> 00:47:27.583
You can react to things in a sweet way
or you can react to things in a deadly way.

00:47:28.647 --> 00:47:32.153
Then [the] humour comes in.

00:47:33.091 --> 00:47:43.147
Also you speak as if there is fragrant
flowers which are coming out.

00:47:43.348 --> 00:47:49.923
Then every action of yours, everything
becomes very gentle and sweet.

00:47:50.124 --> 00:47:58.171
Have this ego that will be gentle,
will be kind, will be sweet,

00:47:58.372 --> 00:48:03.433
will be forgiving, will be loving.
Let’s have this ego.

00:48:03.633 --> 00:48:07.641
Start with this kind of a ego – the other
way round.

00:48:07.842 --> 00:48:13.613
You’ll be surprised how you can really
conquer the whole world.

00:48:13.926 --> 00:48:19.619
On this day of Guru Puja, is, Guru is
supposed to tell something

00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:23.922
to his disciples about correcting
themselves.

00:48:24.123 --> 00:48:28.433
In My own sweet way I’ve said to you
which you shouldn’t mind.

00:48:28.634 --> 00:48:32.505
I don’t mean to condemn you by any chance
but to give you

00:48:32.706 --> 00:48:38.291
a proper sense of introspection, proper
sense of introspection

00:48:38.492 --> 00:48:43.131
by which you all get your Gurupada.

00:48:43.332 --> 00:48:50.463
My only, I shouldn’t say desire, because
I don’t have desires.

00:48:50.664 --> 00:48:56.086
So My only vision is, that I should see
all the Sahaja Yogis

00:48:56.287 --> 00:49:03.295
drenched in the power of love, enjoying
each other's love,

00:49:03.496 --> 00:49:10.764
enjoying each other's relationship, and
improving relationships.

00:49:11.194 --> 00:49:15.557
I know there are problematic people,
I know, they are problematic,

00:49:15.758 --> 00:49:22.134
but if you cannot solve the problem
what’s the use of your become masters?

00:49:24.507 --> 00:49:30.162
So, I leave it to you to solve

00:49:30.637 --> 00:49:39.175
your own problems which you are facing.
And introspection,

00:49:39.376 --> 00:49:46.466
with love and compassion, not by condemning
yourself, I am sure you can manage it.

00:49:46.667 --> 00:49:49.568
May God bless you.
