00:00:04.171 --> 00:00:13.515
Today we are celebrating here a special
day called Makar Sankrant.

00:00:13.716 --> 00:00:21.230
For the information of the foreign Sahaja
Yogis, I will explain to you what it means.

00:00:21.255 --> 00:00:25.422
First I will speak to them in English . Then will speak to you all in Marathi.

00:00:27.417 --> 00:00:32.212
It means the day - today is the day the sun

00:00:32.413 --> 00:00:44.206
crosses over from the Tropic of Capricorn
to the Tropic of Cancer.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.922
It’s a very big day for us because, now

00:00:52.104 --> 00:00:58.365
during the summer time we have the harvest,
and we look forward to the rain

00:00:58.566 --> 00:01:03.198
and so many things that happen in every
country.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:12.499
The sun falls at right angles in this
country during the summer season

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.004
and so we welcome the sun. We eat something

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:24.524
that you must have eaten already, what we
call as til and jaggery.

00:01:24.724 --> 00:01:28.802
It is to prepare your body and your mind

00:01:29.003 --> 00:01:32.592
to give it sufficient heat to receive
the sun.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:37.531
Because if you are living in the cold
season,

00:01:37.732 --> 00:01:45.690
then all your body, mind becomes lethargic

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:53.762
and you become also sometimes very lazy
about things, in the sense

00:01:53.963 --> 00:02:01.488
that the day is so small that you cannot
achieve many results.

00:02:01.946 --> 00:02:10.286
So the body has become cold as we call it.
We take these things, which give us heat,

00:02:10.487 --> 00:02:15.228
so body is prepared to receive the heat
of the sun to welcome it.

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:23.938
To overcome the inertia set in by the cold
weather,

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:32.096
and also to invigorate the body's strength,
tune to the sun,

00:02:32.297 --> 00:02:39.038
people take to all these ways of greeting
you

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:45.157
by which they give you something that is
heat-creating in the body.

00:02:46.255 --> 00:02:51.926
But it has another very subtle expression,
which I find is this:

00:02:52.126 --> 00:02:56.056
that when they give you this, they say,
“Now you take til and gul

00:02:56.257 --> 00:03:00.974
and you say things which are sweet”.

00:03:01.467 --> 00:03:05.825
Because when you are taking til and gul,
your body gets heated up

00:03:06.026 --> 00:03:11.167
and you become right-sided person. When you
become right-sided person

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:16.300
you seldom speak sweetly. So it is
a contrast

00:03:16.501 --> 00:03:20.721
that they give you a thing to heat you up
so that your body gets heated up

00:03:20.921 --> 00:03:25.239
but you must speak sweetly.

00:03:26.166 --> 00:03:29.384
So there is a warning that you are eating
all these things

00:03:29.585 --> 00:03:33.454
but that doesn't mean now you ride on a big
horse of ego

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:37.003
and start slashing everyone.

00:03:37.203 --> 00:03:41.962
It's a very subtle thing to understand that
when we become

00:03:42.163 --> 00:03:48.356
temperamentally right-sided, we are so much
covered by our ego

00:03:48.557 --> 00:03:53.568
that we do not feel that we are hurting
others by what we say.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:57.526
If there are two egoistical people, they
can manage among themselves.

00:03:57.727 --> 00:04:01.861
But if there is one egoistical and another
one who is subdued,

00:04:02.062 --> 00:04:05.208
then the subdued will be finished.

00:04:05.408 --> 00:04:10.197
That's why they say today is the day when
we start speaking very sweetly.

00:04:10.398 --> 00:04:14.265
Even if there is some enemy or somebody
who is not friendly with you,

00:04:14.466 --> 00:04:18.800
or there has been some misunderstanding,
this is the day we say that,

00:04:19.001 --> 00:04:26.516
“All right, take this and say something
very sweet. Talk sweetly to each other”.

00:04:26.717 --> 00:04:30.727
But today only I think I received a letter
from a Sahaja Yogini,

00:04:30.928 --> 00:04:36.717
which was so full of harshness that I was
surprised that I should receive it today.

00:04:36.918 --> 00:04:39.804
Not to Me but some other Sahaja Yogi.

00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:43.635
So one thing today we have to decide and
take a vow

00:04:43.836 --> 00:04:49.360
that to another Sahaja Yogi we are not
going to speak harshly,

00:04:50.895 --> 00:04:55.207
and talk to him in a way as if he is
an ordinary person.

00:04:55.408 --> 00:05:00.044
Now supposing he is a leader: then there is
more reason that you should respect.

00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:06.258
And if he is a senior leader, then there is
more reason that you must respect.

00:05:06.459 --> 00:05:11.500
The first thing one has to learn that we
have to respect.

00:05:11.701 --> 00:05:16.737
Now the sun is so much respected in this
country that in early morning time

00:05:16.938 --> 00:05:23.021
all the people get up and say Namaskars
to Surya with all His names

00:05:23.222 --> 00:05:28.288
and do a particular type of exercise to show
that they are completely surrendered

00:05:28.489 --> 00:05:36.589
to the will of the Surya. When you do that,
then the ego doesn't come in.

00:05:37.626 --> 00:05:42.787
Now the sun, when He shines here, it gives
you a feeling

00:05:42.988 --> 00:05:47.316
that you have to be active, you have
to work very hard.

00:05:47.517 --> 00:05:51.422
As a result of that, you might develop ego.

00:05:51.623 --> 00:05:57.754
But when you develop ego, then it surrounds
your brain completely,

00:05:57.955 --> 00:06:01.756
and when the brain is surrounded with ego,
you do not know

00:06:01.957 --> 00:06:06.979
which way to go. You do not know what is
right, what is wrong.

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:11.143
You do not have any discretion and no
direction.

00:06:11.344 --> 00:06:15.130
You do what you please, whatever pleases
ego.

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.673
And this is a day when we celebrate it in
a way to surrender ourselves to the Surya,

00:06:20.874 --> 00:06:28.971
to the sun which is, as you know, is
the residence of Shri Lord Jesus Christ.

00:06:29.172 --> 00:06:37.551
He resides on the sun. So how humble He
was, how humble He was residing on the sun.

00:06:37.752 --> 00:06:42.882
The more you live on the sun there should
be much more humility.

00:06:43.083 --> 00:06:47.896
Of course, I must say in India people are
humbler. But still,

00:06:48.097 --> 00:06:55.905
the quality of sun can make you extremely
arrogant and very unpleasant person.

00:06:56.106 --> 00:07:01.781
This unpleasant person can really ruin
all kinds of good relations.

00:07:01.982 --> 00:07:08.354
But the worst thing that happens to us is
that we lose our integration.

00:07:08.555 --> 00:07:12.260
Because when we say harsh things to anyone,
we feel guilty

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:17.244
so we have another problem, our heart feels
bad, our liver feels bad,

00:07:17.445 --> 00:07:22.575
everything is upset. And thus we feel
absolutely disintegrated.

00:07:22.776 --> 00:07:29.645
And disintegrated is a sign of our not
evolving at all

00:07:29.845 --> 00:07:33.856
or we should say devolving.

00:07:34.774 --> 00:07:39.760
Disintegration is such a common thing that
we see -

00:07:39.961 --> 00:07:47.705
in ourselves we see that we fight with
our ego.

00:07:47.906 --> 00:07:53.291
Then we fight with our superego, then we
fight with our heart,

00:07:53.492 --> 00:07:59.162
with our emotions, and all the time we are
fighting within ourselves.

00:07:59.363 --> 00:08:04.461
So at least within ourselves we should
speak sweetly on this day.

00:08:04.662 --> 00:08:09.227
Then we can start speaking to others very,
very sweetly.

00:08:09.428 --> 00:08:15.132
Now some people think, to speak sweetly is
a sign of weakness.

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:19.602
In some countries people believe that if
you speak to someone sweetly

00:08:19.803 --> 00:08:25.087
is a sign of weakness. It is the greatest
strength of a Sahaja Yogi

00:08:25.287 --> 00:08:34.318
to speak to others with respect, with proper
protocol, and with proper understanding.

00:08:35.512 --> 00:08:38.926
Now because of arrogance, people also
forget

00:08:39.127 --> 00:08:48.300
what is their situation is, and this
indiscreet temperament

00:08:48.501 --> 00:08:53.616
gives you no sense of direction. You move
in every direction and you don't know

00:08:53.817 --> 00:08:57.659
where you are going. As long as your ego
is satisfied,

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.241
you go ahead with it, and by the time you
discover that you have really become

00:09:02.442 --> 00:09:08.209
a humpty-dumpty, you do not know what you
have done to yourself.

00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:11.491
So the best way to conquer your ego is

00:09:11.692 --> 00:09:17.306
to speak sweetly first of all. It’s such
a small thing to be done

00:09:17.507 --> 00:09:25.762
but it brings you to that synthesis
of character within yourself first of all,

00:09:25.963 --> 00:09:32.380
and to the synthesis of all the beautiful
principles of lives.

00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:35.708
Like you talk to somebody sweetly,

00:09:35.909 --> 00:09:39.923
the person may like you. He may tell you
something,

00:09:40.124 --> 00:09:45.576
which he may be knowing of a very great
importance for you.

00:09:45.777 --> 00:09:53.545
If you talk to somebody sweetly, then you
may get the peace of mind

00:09:53.746 --> 00:09:57.175
because you have given peace to another
person.

00:09:57.376 --> 00:10:00.608
Whatever you give to another person, that
you feel within yourself.

00:10:00.809 --> 00:10:04.754
But if you are quarreling with another
person actually it is the reflection

00:10:04.955 --> 00:10:07.916
of your quarrelling nature within yourself.

00:10:08.117 --> 00:10:12.483
Today there is a big dearth, and big cry
and big organizations

00:10:12.684 --> 00:10:19.024
working out the peace missions. The peace
mission is within yourself.

00:10:19.225 --> 00:10:23.687
Let us start all of us the Sahaja Yogis who
are great saints sitting here,

00:10:23.888 --> 00:10:28.239
decide today that we are going to make
peace with ourselves and with others.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:33.721
But first and foremost thing the peace
cannot be made with quarrels.

00:10:33.922 --> 00:10:37.219
You see, like America and Russia want
to decide it

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:43.518
with missiles, the peace part. They say,
“Let’s fight out.

00:10:43.719 --> 00:10:46.513
As many as will remain, then they can live
in peace.

00:10:46.714 --> 00:10:49.492
Let us all those who are fighting kill each
other”.

00:10:49.693 --> 00:10:53.782
They think this is the solution
of the problem. It's the other way around.

00:10:53.983 --> 00:10:59.997
Let everybody live peacefully within
themselves and give peace to others,

00:11:00.198 --> 00:11:07.019
so that this peace will become a nucleus
for the peace of the world.

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:17.563
So your great task today is to establish
a great source of peaceful people.

00:11:17.764 --> 00:11:21.240
We are so many Sahaja Yogis here.

00:11:21.441 --> 00:11:25.190
You are sitting in complete peace and
happiness and joy,

00:11:25.391 --> 00:11:30.116
you don't know, you are emitting all that
peace, channelizing it and doing it.

00:11:30.317 --> 00:11:37.826
But still there are some who are suffering
from horrible ego, and with hurt ego;

00:11:38.027 --> 00:11:44.214
and they are trying to do something, which
they should never do, is to think just now.

00:11:44.425 --> 00:11:48.326
If you are thinking just now, you will not
register what I am saying

00:11:48.527 --> 00:11:54.624
because this is another quality of a person
who is ego oriented is not to register.

00:11:54.825 --> 00:11:57.136
You may say anything you like but they
don't hear.

00:11:57.337 --> 00:12:00.431
They hear what they want to hear or they
don't hear.

00:12:00.631 --> 00:12:04.397
So this is another thing we have to today
decide,

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:11.118
that we’ll register things than to tell
off. Let us register.

00:12:11.319 --> 00:12:18.412
This is a sign of a character that wants
to know; wants to know more about;

00:12:18.613 --> 00:12:25.038
the criteria of ascent is synthesis and
integration.

00:12:25.239 --> 00:12:33.030
A person who is not integrated with other
Sahaja Yogis is not a man who has ascended.

00:12:33.231 --> 00:12:37.058
Who tries to divide and talk of divisions.

00:12:37.259 --> 00:12:42.328
“We the English, We the Germans, We
the Indians,”

00:12:42.529 --> 00:12:46.648
then they are not Sahaja Yogis. They are
Indians all right, but not Sahaja Yogis.

00:12:46.849 --> 00:12:51.423
Sahaja Yogis have no caste, creed or
nationality.

00:12:51.624 --> 00:12:56.660
We have to carry our passports only because
we are born in this jail.

00:12:56.861 --> 00:13:01.521
So we have to carry our criminal number!

00:13:03.527 --> 00:13:08.179
But actually you don't need it. You don't
need all those things.

00:13:08.380 --> 00:13:12.723
Now for us today to decide first of all
in our hearts

00:13:12.924 --> 00:13:15.807
that we’ll take to peaceful methods.

00:13:16.008 --> 00:13:19.835
When we are travelling, we’ll be taking
to peaceful methods.

00:13:20.036 --> 00:13:25.044
Anybody who is trying to provoke you or
trying to create a problem

00:13:25.245 --> 00:13:32.570
or divide you on any issue whatsoever, run
away from that person as fast as possible.

00:13:32.771 --> 00:13:39.410
Anybody who talks of peace, the peace-
makers, stick on to that person -

00:13:39.912 --> 00:13:45.412
then only you will understand that you are
also getting peace.

00:13:46.777 --> 00:13:52.719
Here you have come to get peace, not
to create problems,

00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:58.344
or to listen to your problems, but to get
to peace.

00:13:58.545 --> 00:14:07.790
Peace is a nature or is the quality of your
Spirit.

00:14:07.991 --> 00:14:13.112
So, once you jump onto your peace somehow

00:14:13.313 --> 00:14:21.130
what happens that you go beyond the cause
and the effect.

00:14:21.331 --> 00:14:24.081
You are beyond the cause and the effect.

00:14:24.282 --> 00:14:29.121
So the cause disappears and the effect also
disappears.

00:14:29.322 --> 00:14:35.866
So today we all have come here to worship
the peace, the within and the without.

00:14:36.067 --> 00:14:40.899
Let us be peaceful people. Let us not join
groups who hate,

00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:45.734
who talk big, who want to hate one person,
want to create a group,

00:14:45.935 --> 00:14:51.422
who says "we the Americans" or "we
the this", just.

00:14:51.623 --> 00:14:58.161
In Sahaja Yoga you must learn from people
who have advanced,

00:14:58.362 --> 00:15:03.744
who have very much progressed. For example
I would say among all the Europeans,

00:15:03.945 --> 00:15:09.389
Australians have done very well. There’s
nothing to feel jealous.

00:15:10.709 --> 00:15:14.995
All right, if Australians have done well,
alright that's your glory.

00:15:15.195 --> 00:15:19.517
So ask them how they have done it, how
they have worked it out.

00:15:19.718 --> 00:15:27.935
Tomorrow may be that Americans - I wish
that very much - may do the best,

00:15:28.472 --> 00:15:33.307
so then you should ask them how have you
done so well.

00:15:33.508 --> 00:15:37.639
That's the way we’re going to live. We are
not going to compete,

00:15:37.840 --> 00:15:42.183
we are not going to be jealous, but we are
going to absorb all that is best.

00:15:42.395 --> 00:15:45.271
This is Sahaja Yoga. Is the other way
around,

00:15:45.472 --> 00:15:48.754
like if they discover something -
a pilotless bomb -

00:15:48.955 --> 00:15:53.513
then they will discover something else
which is a machine-less bomb.

00:15:53.714 --> 00:15:59.786
No, it is another one. We develop a mind
which absorbs everything,

00:15:59.987 --> 00:16:04.787
and then we develop a bigger mind, which
gives everything.

00:16:04.988 --> 00:16:10.610
There is no secret in Sahaja Yoga. Everybody
who has known something better,

00:16:10.811 --> 00:16:14.877
has had some good experiences of Sahaja Yoga
should tell.

00:16:15.078 --> 00:16:18.057
But then in ego I have seen people start
preaching

00:16:18.258 --> 00:16:22.075
that, “All right, this method you try, that
method you try”.

00:16:22.276 --> 00:16:26.899
There is no need to do that also, because
of lack of discretion.

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:30.544
If you had discretion you would have known
that this is not to be done.

00:16:30.745 --> 00:16:33.848
What is not to be done in Sahaja Yoga is
not to be done.

00:16:34.049 --> 00:16:39.020
But how will you know when you have no
discretion, like a lost ship.

00:16:39.221 --> 00:16:46.221
So then you have to see how your Mother
would act at such a position

00:16:46.713 --> 00:16:51.836
and then I’m sure you’ll go beyond the cause
and the effect.

00:16:52.037 --> 00:16:55.943
So today is the day I should also not say
anything

00:16:56.144 --> 00:17:00.789
that is in any way hurting to anyone

00:17:00.990 --> 00:17:06.899
and I am trying to make you smile and laugh
but you are so serious.

00:17:08.776 --> 00:17:14.709
So today we decide on peace. Peace with
ourselves, peace with others

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:20.517
and that is how we worship the sun, Christ,
the One who was the emblem,

00:17:20.718 --> 00:17:28.925
who was the absolute practical symbol
of that peace.

00:17:29.664 --> 00:17:37.082
And once you understand this, I am sure you
will try to follow that, instead of

00:17:37.283 --> 00:17:42.286
hitting everybody, getting angry with
everybody. Just forget all these things.

00:17:42.487 --> 00:17:47.149
You have come here to ascend and your gain
is your gain.

00:17:47.350 --> 00:17:50.452
Your fighting is not your gain, remember
that.

00:17:50.653 --> 00:17:55.473
Your quarrelling is not your gain. The gain
is the peace that you have achieved,

00:17:55.674 --> 00:18:00.222
the love that you have developed,
the compassion that you can emit,

00:18:00.423 --> 00:18:04.991
the amount of relationship and the rapport
you can penetrate into others.

00:18:05.192 --> 00:18:08.876
This is your gain which we have to receive
today:

00:18:09.077 --> 00:18:15.456
a mind, a heart like a lion, and not
chicken-hearted people.

00:18:15.657 --> 00:18:21.374
Not people who would be angry and this,
to boast of your anger:

00:18:21.575 --> 00:18:26.508
these days are gone, we boast of our peace,
we boast of our contentment,

00:18:26.709 --> 00:18:33.331
we boast of our glory and we boast of our
state.

00:18:33.899 --> 00:18:38.269
And that is the state where we are now
in the Kingdom of God.

00:18:38.470 --> 00:18:41.782
May God bless you all! (Then Shri Mataji
continues in Marathi for about 12 minutes)

00:18:42.452 --> 00:18:49.420
Now I want to tell you that so many guests have come to us responding to your cordial invitaton

00:18:49.532 --> 00:18:56.110
and you have made proper arrangements for their stay.

00:18:56.135 --> 00:19:03.007
About this, none of you have   indicated to me how much trouble you have taken or efforts you have made.

00:19:03.032 --> 00:19:10.678
Especially , the Mumbaites have made great efforts. So on behalf of all of you and these people here

00:19:10.703 --> 00:19:14.128
I must say  that the Mumbai people have  taken a lead.

00:19:14.549 --> 00:19:17.021
However I am telling you the same thing which I tell them.

00:19:17.046 --> 00:19:18.799
Today we offer  the sesame and jaggery mix,

00:19:18.824 --> 00:19:22.322
so as to avoid any ill effects from the Sun.

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:26.340
First issue is, with   Sun in the sky one becomes irascible.

00:19:26.523 --> 00:19:28.732
One speaks in an insulting manner with others.

00:19:28.803 --> 00:19:30.803
The person’s ego strengthens.

00:19:30.903 --> 00:19:33.689
People who are directly exposed to Sun have big egos.

00:19:34.148 --> 00:19:38.757
Hence such people should remember that this is a mantra –“Talk sweetly“

00:19:38.854 --> 00:19:42.759
Consuming  sesame and jaggery  increases the body heat and the person starts shouting.

00:19:42.814 --> 00:19:46.474
Means , just a short time back you were offered sesame and jaggery, at least for that sake converse sweetly with me!

00:19:49.963 --> 00:19:51.288
But even that  seems difficult.

00:19:51.334 --> 00:19:54.612
They accept the sesame-jaggery mix and start shouting the next moment.
What sesame-Jaggery?Throw it away!

00:19:56.212 --> 00:20:02.413
So, on this occasion, we should understand that this is good opportunity.

00:20:02.938 --> 00:20:06.894
Shri Mataji came here and however fervently she advised us,

00:20:06.927 --> 00:20:08.753
it will not enter our heads.

00:20:08.778 --> 00:20:11.625
If there is heat in our head nothing will enter.

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.226
This heat should go away.

00:20:13.313 --> 00:20:15.619
And from where does this heat come in us?

00:20:15.667 --> 00:20:17.072
It emanates from  our ego.

00:20:18.307 --> 00:20:23.107
In the past, when I commenced with Sahaja Yoga, all were having disputes.

00:20:23.243 --> 00:20:25.813
So much so that it was fortunate that they did not break skulls.

00:20:25.869 --> 00:20:27.940
However the heads are intact now.

00:20:28.004 --> 00:20:29.253
But quarrels abound.

00:20:29.403 --> 00:20:31.637
They were rampant due to one or the other reason.

00:20:31.661 --> 00:20:34.184
Half of them ran away and half remained.

00:20:34.209 --> 00:20:38.482
I thought , Sahaja Yoga was not possible because  one person  would join in  and run away after two days,

00:20:38.641 --> 00:20:40.422
Another would come  and run away after three days.

00:20:40.493 --> 00:20:42.128
This was the situation.

00:20:42.256 --> 00:20:45.295
We have established  Sahaja Yoga in such a commotion.

00:20:45.602 --> 00:20:47.720
There is only one main reason and that is,

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:53.619
you should have the desire that “whatever may it may be, we have come to meet God almighty.

00:20:53.969 --> 00:20:59.161
We  want His  blessings, we want to know the Divine Principle.

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:04.781
We want to obliterate  all those things in the world  that  torment  and trouble everyone.”

00:21:04.897 --> 00:21:08.112
Hence  we cannot afford to fight here.

00:21:08.253 --> 00:21:12.896
This  ego has caused so many problems all over the world.

00:21:12.951 --> 00:21:16.832
Now we should completely give it up(tilanjali) in  Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:16.925 --> 00:21:19.212
And Tilanjali means offering of sesame.

00:21:19.518 --> 00:21:27.119
That means take sesame  in hands held together in the cup form, and do your offering that we shall not find faults with  others, get angry with them.

00:21:27.216 --> 00:21:31.099
Try it once.  You should try it once.

00:21:31.172 --> 00:21:35.015
One can resolve many things without  getting angry.

00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:47.299
One  can  face so many things, and that a number of problems get resolved just because you have not paid attention to those things.

00:21:47.363 --> 00:21:49.212
You will see that whatever issues that were there, have been resolved.

00:21:49.252 --> 00:21:59.496
If we give too much importance to a particular thing then one could  say that you have acquired a Tamasik temperament. (vengeful)

00:21:59.521 --> 00:22:00.386
What is the meaning of  Tamasik?

00:22:00.416 --> 00:22:12.107
A person who makes a big issue out of small thing. Suppose a woman, whose  husband is ill. “ My husband is ill, my husband is ill”. Agreed, but you are there! you are in good health !.

00:22:12.132 --> 00:22:13.498
What about you? But she will not think thus.

00:22:13.535 --> 00:22:19.743
While it is true that husband is important but one  gets fixated   over a small thing.

00:22:19.768 --> 00:22:22.196
Blow it out of proportion and harass others with it, trouble others

00:22:22.419 --> 00:22:25.291
This is a common practice with us and the reason behind it,

00:22:25.323 --> 00:22:31.023
Is that we give importance to small issues and ignore the big ones.

00:22:31.475 --> 00:22:34.577
For these people, small and big are just the same.

00:22:34.626 --> 00:22:37.775
They do not understand anything about it , but you should understand.

00:22:37.804 --> 00:22:44.917
The reason is that whatever great things we have , the heritage, that we have received, is   great.

00:22:45.039 --> 00:22:46.280
So we got heritage.

00:22:46.328 --> 00:22:48.899
We were born in this land of Yoga (Yoga bhoomi).

00:22:48.979 --> 00:22:53.631
What did we achieve after having born  in this yoga bhoomi ?

00:22:53.966 --> 00:22:59.720
It is said that one is born in India after the Tapasya (penance) of a thousand years and after another thousand years, in Maharashtra.

00:22:59.839 --> 00:23:03.893
When I see drunk people on the road , I don’t know if they are from Maharashtra or elsewhere.

00:23:03.965 --> 00:23:06.385
I mean one cannot understand how these worms were born here.

00:23:06.700 --> 00:23:11.148
You have become Sahaja Yogis because of your Tapasya (penance)  in  the last life,now you are getting its reward.

00:23:11.173 --> 00:23:16.165
But it does not mean that Shri Mataji has to perform the rest of your Tapasya of this life.

00:23:18.555 --> 00:23:23.640
The first penance of this life is to talk sweetly with each other.

00:23:25.371 --> 00:23:29.879
Behave lovingly. Not to be curt.First  thing.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:34.807
Hence we have initiated the practice of having the Puja on this first day.

00:23:34.934 --> 00:23:39.228
On this day we all  should speak sweet words   and behave amicably.

00:23:39.281 --> 00:23:41.363
Because speaking sweet words is very easy.

00:23:42.285 --> 00:23:44.172
Getting angry is more difficult.

00:23:44.237 --> 00:23:46.514
And beating is impossible.

00:23:46.539 --> 00:23:48.259
Then why to do these difficult things?

00:23:48.284 --> 00:23:49.848
Just speak sweetly and you are done.

00:23:50.148 --> 00:23:53.061
Amongst us, there are many whose surname is ‘Godbole’(“Sweet speaking person”)

00:23:59.045 --> 00:24:03.347
I thought that the people from their families speak sweetly.

00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:08.418
They really spoke sweet but while using sugar coated words they used to  cut others’ throats.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:12.042
So, I asked,” What is this? ” They answered,

00:24:12.066 --> 00:24:16.513
In the past while our people spoke sweet language, others took their advantage.

00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:20.044
So we use sweet words and also cut the throats.” I asked, “Why ?

00:24:20.069 --> 00:24:21.537
Is this something good that you have learnt ?

00:24:21.601 --> 00:24:23.212
Has it done any  good to you?

00:24:23.292 --> 00:24:25.021
Have you risen above it?

00:24:26.529 --> 00:24:28.624
Those who spoke sweet language were all right.

00:24:28.697 --> 00:24:30.936
They lived comfortably and contentedly.”

00:24:31.146 --> 00:24:36.804
Suppose you quarrel with two persons and you cut their throats, then what have you gained?

00:24:38.831 --> 00:24:41.164
One  must see what one has gained.

00:24:41.655 --> 00:24:46.092
So today is the day of a special festival which everybody enjoys.

00:24:46.117 --> 00:24:48.855
Atleast I do not want to say bitter things at this time.

00:24:48.966 --> 00:24:58.609
So I say  with due respect to everyone that I   take enough care that  it should not happen that people feel bad or so.

00:24:58.665 --> 00:25:01.458
Now, some people come and suddenly touch my body.

00:25:01.899 --> 00:25:03.120
It troubles me a lot.

00:25:03.240 --> 00:25:04.256
One should not do so.

00:25:04.296 --> 00:25:08.153
But, how do I  tell ? So I   to bear it.  Let it go, what else can I do?

00:25:08.455 --> 00:25:09.780
As  that person will feel bad.

00:25:10.236 --> 00:25:11.743
Thus I have to bear a lot.

00:25:11.942 --> 00:25:13.942
I do not mind bearing it.

00:25:14.353 --> 00:25:17.051
If I hurt the person, he will feel bad.. So why do that?

00:25:17.076 --> 00:25:18.901
I can bear that much pain.

00:25:19.008 --> 00:25:24.000
I do not mind it, being aware that I have the strength to bear which  others do not have.

00:25:25.252 --> 00:25:27.061
The same is also true about love.

00:25:27.284 --> 00:25:31.903
If our power of love is stronger and the others’ is less, then who is greater, we or those people?

00:25:33.436 --> 00:25:41.105
In general if we think that we are Sahaj Yogis and our Mother has bestowed on us the power of love so we are superior than them.

00:25:41.130 --> 00:25:43.044
So, what do we lose even if they say something?

00:25:43.069 --> 00:25:46.942
What is the need to fight and get angry with them.?

00:25:49.203 --> 00:25:54.132
As your temperament becomes peaceful, your face will have a glow.

00:25:54.347 --> 00:25:58.680
Not only this, when people around see you, they will say that he is a peaceful  person.

00:25:59.004 --> 00:26:04.083
However, being peaceful does not mean that if somebody beats you up, you should bear it.

00:26:04.115 --> 00:26:04.806
Not at all!

00:26:05.658 --> 00:26:11.436
Christ has said only for Sahaj yogis, that if you are slapped on one cheek, show the other.

00:26:11.461 --> 00:26:12.627
Only for the Sahaja Yogis.

00:26:12.632 --> 00:26:13.974
Not for other people.

00:26:14.538 --> 00:26:17.913
For other people, I would say that if they slap you once, you give them four slaps.

00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.286
Because if they have ghosts(catches), they will go  away.

00:26:22.505 --> 00:26:29.158
But, amongst Sahaja Yogis your talk with each other should be pure and loving.

00:26:29.318 --> 00:26:30.807
It is very necessary.

00:26:30.927 --> 00:26:33.673
All should talk lovingly amongst each other.

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:39.267
And I do not mind if you speak this way with an outsider.

00:26:39.334 --> 00:26:43.817
But, one who is ours, a Sahaja Yogi, is embodied in Me.

00:26:43.928 --> 00:26:46.418
Every Sahaja Yogi is in my body.

00:26:46.513 --> 00:26:52.450
Hence if you are kicking each other or abuse each other, then you should think that you are abusing me.

00:26:52.942 --> 00:27:00.620
Because if there are ten branches on a tree, if these fight amongst themselves, what will happen to the tree and what will happen to its leaves?

00:27:01.204 --> 00:27:05.291
If my hand starts quarrelling with my other hand then what will happen?

00:27:06.073 --> 00:27:09.001
If it is understood that we all are one

00:27:09.163 --> 00:27:15.683
Overall, we have so much unity amongst ourselves that we are elements of the same body.

00:27:15.990 --> 00:27:20.275
Then how should  we behave, how much understanding we should have,

00:27:20.477 --> 00:27:25.655
how warm our love for each other should be, how desirous we should be to give pleasure to each other,

00:27:25.734 --> 00:27:28.464
what should be done to make them happy..what should I give them?

00:27:28.514 --> 00:27:29.315
What will they like?

00:27:29.355 --> 00:27:32.950
Now in Diwali, or during Sankranti, we give presents..

00:27:32.975 --> 00:27:34.791
So What present should we give them today?

00:27:34.867 --> 00:27:38.359
so we give them something that is cheap and low value.

00:27:39.613 --> 00:27:41.074
This is peculiar.

00:27:41.553 --> 00:27:42.712
We are very intelligent in such things.

00:27:42.792 --> 00:27:46.732
Get the cheapest thing from the market and offer it saying,

00:27:46.776 --> 00:27:49.629
‘Accept  our gift” – so that the other should take it and throw it away.

00:27:51.792 --> 00:27:54.601
So unless there is benevolence in the heart, this thing cannot happen.

00:27:54.626 --> 00:27:58.307
And you have not lost that benevolence  of heart.

00:27:58.454 --> 00:28:03.105
You have that heart in you because now the lamp of atma,  that has lit in you

00:28:03.256 --> 00:28:05.669
has given you immense illumination.

00:28:05.823 --> 00:28:07.998
Such a clean beautiful, chaste heart.

00:28:08.237 --> 00:28:13.609
Whatever – full of love that is flowing through the heart – .one should continue to gaze at it happily.What a great pleasure it is!

00:28:13.634 --> 00:28:18.264
I came here and seeing you people I felt amazed.– look,  what all is flowing from  the light of the heart –

00:28:18.304 --> 00:28:19.764
What a great pleasure it is!

00:28:20.077 --> 00:28:24.870
Thus you all should feel that we  are the elements of Shri Mataji’s being.

00:28:24.895 --> 00:28:27.767
If we make some mistake, it pains Mataji’s body.

00:28:27.839 --> 00:28:29.625
It will cause pain to her being..

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:31.291
So we should not behave like that at all.

00:28:31.416 --> 00:28:38.974
We should have a sort of prudence in us, a sort of understanding in us and we should have a courteous  behavior.

00:28:39.118 --> 00:28:42.410
There are some who stall  others  like a disoriented person;

00:28:42.869 --> 00:28:45.496
or who indulge  into mindless childish prattles.

00:28:45.528 --> 00:28:51.132
Many  have a compulsive habit of singing and some read poems incessantly  or something else.

00:28:51.196 --> 00:28:51.823
This is not right.

00:28:51.974 --> 00:28:57.625
We should do things that are proper, pragmatic and elegant.

00:28:57.851 --> 00:28:59.938
Even in our behavior there should be elegance.

00:29:00.315 --> 00:29:05.125
When we make ornaments for Mother, how beautiful they are!

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:09.950
But you only  are my ornaments and I have adorned you on my body.

00:29:09.975 --> 00:29:23.823
If those ornaments lack cleanliness, or are impure that is they lack the main quality

00:29:23.950 --> 00:29:28.466
meaning if they are  gold ornaments without gold, or contain brass instead of gold, then what is the use?

00:29:29.744 --> 00:29:31.442
The same applies to you too.

00:29:31.529 --> 00:29:41.364
If the main element embodied in you is fake then where  will I go showing it off?

00:29:41.665 --> 00:29:46.442
So you are my ornament, you only have decorated me.

00:29:46.555 --> 00:29:48.759
I do not need any other ornament.

00:29:48.878 --> 00:29:57.386
I submit to you in great earnest that while speaking with kids or anybody else,

00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:06.599
one should perform the task very sensibly, very politely and slowly.

00:30:06.657 --> 00:30:11.300
There is no point in forcing, in being rude or doing hurry with anyone.

00:30:11.568 --> 00:30:16.505
This way there  will be a day when the whole world will behold you with great awe.

00:30:16.585 --> 00:30:20.783
“ Where do these people come from, who are these people ?”.

00:30:21.046 --> 00:30:23.815
Then they will know that these are messengers from the heaven.

00:30:24.152 --> 00:30:33.517
To take care of the whole world, to bestow success on the world, to escort the world to God’s doorstep.

00:30:33.557 --> 00:30:35.589
These are messengers sent by the Almighty.

00:30:35.764 --> 00:30:38.184
I bow to such messengers..
