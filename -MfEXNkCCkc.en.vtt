00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:04.365
It's a great day

00:00:05.645 --> 00:00:07.445
for Me to come to Italy

00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:09.665
to celebrate

00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:11.885
Ganesh Puja

00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:25.135
The nature

00:00:25.385 --> 00:00:26.445
which we see around

00:00:27.235 --> 00:00:29.665
is the blessing of the Ganesha only

00:00:29.665 --> 00:00:32.465
because He is the one who prays to the Mother Earth

00:00:33.795 --> 00:00:34.685
that

00:00:34.685 --> 00:00:37.645
she should grant her blessings upon

00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:38.645
human beings

00:00:56.065 --> 00:00:57.315
It is He

00:00:58.025 --> 00:00:59.565
who moors

00:01:00.755 --> 00:01:03.275
all the elements of the nature

00:01:11.685 --> 00:01:14.505
and moors them to create life.

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:22.805
As you call them, these are all carbohydrates.

00:01:28.295 --> 00:01:32.355
Now the carbohydrates have got carbon and hydrogen.

00:01:38.305 --> 00:01:40.295
Carbon is coming

00:01:41.035 --> 00:01:42.495
from Shri Ganesh

00:01:43.055 --> 00:01:45.325
and hydrogen is coming from Mahakali.

00:01:52.285 --> 00:01:55.335
And that is how this universe is created

00:01:55.955 --> 00:01:58.875
in this beautiful way all around us.

00:02:06.575 --> 00:02:07.575
Now,

00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:13.195
these carbohydrates need oxygen which is given to us by the Sun,

00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:14.665
by the right side.

00:02:26.275 --> 00:02:28.695
Thus, you know that in the night

00:02:29.135 --> 00:02:32.065
these trees emit hydrogen

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.840
and in the day time they generate oxygen.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.840
This is all the trick of Shri Ganesha who is sitting in between

00:02:57.895 --> 00:03:00.215
Now it is He who becomes the Sun.

00:03:04.415 --> 00:03:07.035
He ascents from the

00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:09.925
deep down seat

00:03:10.795 --> 00:03:12.295
below the Kundalini,

00:03:12.865 --> 00:03:15.335
rises on the left hand side of Mahakali,

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:19.375
goes up and settles in the Surya,

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:21.895
that is the Agnya.

00:03:37.495 --> 00:03:41.205
So, Mahakali which is the Primordial Energy

00:03:42.925 --> 00:03:45.925
is absolutely transcended by Him.

00:03:55.025 --> 00:03:57.255
As the child of Mahakali

00:03:57.625 --> 00:04:00.755
He is absolutely dedicated and devoted to Her.

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:12.255
And that is how He is the master of the Mahakali power,Lord of.

00:04:18.395 --> 00:04:20.915
That means He is the Lord of subconscious mind.

00:04:24.865 --> 00:04:27.735
He is the Lord of all the 'jadas'.

00:04:28.715 --> 00:04:29.935
Jada,

00:04:30.635 --> 00:04:32.165
that is, you can say the dead.

00:04:33.165 --> 00:04:36.105
Not the dead but 'jada' is the one

00:04:36.105 --> 00:04:39.535
matter which has not - matter and the dead.

00:04:44.165 --> 00:04:45.925
You must understand the word 'jada'.

00:04:45.925 --> 00:04:51.240
Very important. Jada means all that is the matter which is not moving,

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.640
without life.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.880
So He can transcend

00:05:05.495 --> 00:05:06.495
this

00:05:07.095 --> 00:05:08.355
great power

00:05:09.675 --> 00:05:12.175
and become the lord of that power

00:05:12.525 --> 00:05:13.525
by one

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.260
very small little wisdom He has.

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.940
Now that small little wisdom is

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:40.425
surrender.

00:05:46.315 --> 00:05:51.765
And the surrender is to be understood in it's proper sense.

00:05:56.845 --> 00:05:57.885
Surrender

00:05:58.255 --> 00:06:00.665
is signifying,

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.540
no giving up anything.

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:16.180
Because whenever you try to give up or take up you are using your ego.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.220
But surrendering means

00:06:28.225 --> 00:06:29.965
giving up the ego itself.

00:06:37.195 --> 00:06:40.405
So, all the ideas of giving up something

00:06:40.405 --> 00:06:43.105
or taking in something, disappear.

00:06:53.165 --> 00:06:56.075
Keep your eyes open because you see I'm talking about

00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:58.835
the subconscious  and I don't want you to keep your eyes close, that's a sign

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.620
of going into subconscious.

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.080
This has to be recorded in your conscious mind.

00:07:18.865 --> 00:07:20.585
Now when we surrender,

00:07:23.925 --> 00:07:27.065
we have to see how Ritambara Pragnya,

00:07:27.065 --> 00:07:28.405
which is the power

00:07:29.285 --> 00:07:32.395
of Mahalakshmi, the essence of Mahalakshmi,

00:07:32.395 --> 00:07:33.645
how She helps you.

00:07:46.895 --> 00:07:49.625
Like situations we should accept

00:07:55.535 --> 00:07:58.435
Say, this morning, it was Amavasya,

00:07:59.245 --> 00:08:02.445
it's the day when if you worship

00:08:03.505 --> 00:08:07.485
Shri Ganesha, it's very deep.So, I wanted to have

00:08:07.845 --> 00:08:11.895
from the end of Amavasya to start the puja.

00:08:26.615 --> 00:08:29.205
Now, that's why the water finished;

00:08:29.205 --> 00:08:30.415
it would not start

00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:32.400
I could not take my bath.

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:47.040
Because I have said- if I had said that we'll have puja at lunch time, many would have felt, "Oh God, now no lunch".

00:09:00.735 --> 00:09:03.665
But that was the right time to start the puja,

00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:04.865
so there was no water

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.660
and I had to wait for the water.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:18.320
And a simple thing like that happened

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.280
but it achieved

00:09:22.335 --> 00:09:24.425
the right time.

00:09:37.115 --> 00:09:39.275
Now when you start

00:09:39.275 --> 00:09:41.355
accepting situations,

00:09:42.955 --> 00:09:45.955
then you realize that all the situations

00:09:45.955 --> 00:09:47.265
are created

00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:52.605
not by anything else but Ritambara Pragnya Herself.

00:10:09.725 --> 00:10:13.895
But ego is such a thing, that it wants to do the way it likes.

00:10:25.865 --> 00:10:31.595
So people start doing things against the plans of the Divine.

00:10:38.135 --> 00:10:40.285
And all the time they are in friction

00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.920
and in trouble, going against.

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.700
And thus, they have to take a double speed to fight.

00:11:01.155 --> 00:11:05.685
But going against the Divine, we are going against our ascent.

00:11:12.015 --> 00:11:15.305
These egos develop as a result

00:11:15.615 --> 00:11:18.425
of our upbringing, atmosphere

00:11:19.255 --> 00:11:21.885
and as a natural idea to assert.

00:11:25.155 --> 00:11:28.095
These as our conditioning and our upbringing

00:11:28.445 --> 00:11:33.015
and also as a natural idea we have to assert others.

00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:58.960
Natural idea

00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.840
No assertion, assertion means pressing others,

00:12:09.305 --> 00:12:11.725
dominating others.

00:12:14.185 --> 00:12:17.155
Now this domination part come to us

00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:20.715
from the matter because the matter dominates the Spirit.

00:12:30.905 --> 00:12:33.815
It dominates us through giving us comfort,

00:12:33.975 --> 00:12:36.435
false notions, false ideas.

00:12:44.995 --> 00:12:47.405
It dominates through our desires

00:12:51.195 --> 00:12:53.345
It dominates through lust and greed.

00:13:01.065 --> 00:13:03.845
Also it dominates us

00:13:04.735 --> 00:13:06.115
through a very

00:13:06.505 --> 00:13:07.865
subtle way

00:13:08.255 --> 00:13:11.295
by possessing us through bhoots as we call them.

00:13:25.235 --> 00:13:26.985
And this is what

00:13:27.385 --> 00:13:28.385
we see how

00:13:28.825 --> 00:13:30.635
Shri Ganesha ascended

00:13:31.495 --> 00:13:35.965
as Christ to show us how we have to ascend

00:13:36.305 --> 00:13:39.255
out of all this mire of matter.

00:13:55.825 --> 00:14:01.455
As He is ascending we catch hold of this feet and we also ascend with Him.

00:14:10.385 --> 00:14:12.845
Though He is a child, He is very powerful

00:14:12.845 --> 00:14:15.635
and he can take us to that level

00:14:15.745 --> 00:14:18.685
where the Spirit resides.

00:14:27.725 --> 00:14:31.015
Now the first thing that we have to know is about sex.

00:14:38.265 --> 00:14:42.285
In the west, sex has become an obsession with people

00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:47.900
as if it's a religion.

00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:54.500
And if they cannot be sexually active

00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:58.295
or if they are not having any sex activities,

00:14:58.675 --> 00:15:00.425
they think they are all wasted.

00:15:01.065 --> 00:15:04.165
They are good for nothing.

00:15:09.925 --> 00:15:15.915
The whole atmosphere is built up like that through your medias, through your televisions

00:15:15.915 --> 00:15:18.745
All kinds of things are put in to your head to feel

00:15:18.745 --> 00:15:21.460
that your inferior if you are not dealing with sex.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:44.005
And when we get attached to

00:15:45.095 --> 00:15:50.465
this kind of a stupid idea that our life is only meant for sex enjoyment,

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:55.700
we start descending downward instead of descending upward.

00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:06.060
What is that? Lizard

00:16:06.575 --> 00:16:09.065
I don't like them very much

00:16:10.125 --> 00:16:11.125
Alright, doesn't matter

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:14.565
It's a very different type of a lizard than an Indian

00:16:15.155 --> 00:16:16.165
Better looking

00:16:17.985 --> 00:16:18.985
Yogi : Smaller

00:16:23.775 --> 00:16:24.815
Ah, she's green.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:30.240
You don't get green. Alright so

00:16:41.660 --> 00:16:43.500
So, to descend down

00:16:44.205 --> 00:16:45.755
is very easy,

00:16:46.505 --> 00:16:48.375
to fall is the easiest.

00:16:49.105 --> 00:16:50.125
And when

00:16:50.635 --> 00:16:53.625
the idea of sex all the time hover our mind,

00:16:54.375 --> 00:16:57.055
our attention gets so much filled with it,

00:16:57.055 --> 00:16:59.625
that even with our eyes, with our thoughts,

00:16:59.625 --> 00:17:03.265
with our mind, our head, everything it is nothing but

00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:06.120
just this filth in our head.

00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:33.260
So, for the young people, when they get married

00:17:33.635 --> 00:17:38.015
the best thing is, they should realize the importance of sex

00:17:38.485 --> 00:17:41.635
is not so great.

00:17:54.975 --> 00:17:56.405
And they should start

00:17:56.765 --> 00:17:59.835
understanding that it is not a sin

00:17:59.835 --> 00:18:01.595
but it is not also everything.

00:18:09.095 --> 00:18:11.675
Then also women must know that

00:18:11.675 --> 00:18:14.765
they are on this earth to give

00:18:15.475 --> 00:18:18.745
place for the Realized souls to be born.

00:18:28.095 --> 00:18:31.475
And in the name of Ganesha, they should have innocent children.

00:18:35.925 --> 00:18:41.305
But when these Realized sould are born in the west, they do not keep their pure form

00:18:41.305 --> 00:18:44.235
because the parents are in a funny shape.

00:18:56.915 --> 00:18:59.455
And though the Ganesha has done all the best

00:18:59.455 --> 00:19:02.725
that is possible to get the best children

00:19:02.915 --> 00:19:05.665
in the womb of the Realized mothers,

00:19:06.055 --> 00:19:09.305
they get really absolutely affected.

00:19:24.235 --> 00:19:27.295
And we start hurting them by our

00:19:27.295 --> 00:19:30.595
ill behaviour, by our wrong ideas.

00:19:41.275 --> 00:19:46.805
So when you are pregnant, one should read Ganesha's stotram,

00:19:46.805 --> 00:19:49.735
must do puja of Ganesha and try to remain pure

00:19:49.735 --> 00:19:51.595
as far as sex is concerned.

00:20:06.335 --> 00:20:08.785
Moreover, we start thinking about

00:20:08.785 --> 00:20:10.560
something that is so spontaneous.

00:20:20.020 --> 00:20:23.375
What is there to think about it? Just an Indian won't understand this

00:20:23.375 --> 00:20:27.845
they won't understand in the village what is there to think about sex, it's so spontaneous.

00:20:27.845 --> 00:20:29.900
It's like thinking about going to the bathroom.

00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:50.920
It's a joyless pursuit and imaginary ideas

00:20:58.805 --> 00:21:01.835
So one has to be very very alert,

00:21:02.065 --> 00:21:04.765
that we are now saints, we are Yogis

00:21:04.765 --> 00:21:07.865
and we are not going to waste our energy

00:21:07.865 --> 00:21:09.125
in this kind of a joyless pursuit.

00:21:22.615 --> 00:21:23.865
What is it there?

00:21:28.695 --> 00:21:29.695
What's it?

00:21:30.325 --> 00:21:31.795
It's a beetle, Ah

00:21:33.055 --> 00:21:35.065
can't be afraid of beetles.

00:21:38.260 --> 00:21:39.900
Alright, now

00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:46.920
when we understand our life as so important,

00:21:47.260 --> 00:21:49.420
for the imancipation of humanity,

00:21:50.505 --> 00:21:52.725
for giving light to others,

00:21:53.585 --> 00:21:58.945
for saving the whole world from the disaster, it is awaiting

00:21:59.605 --> 00:22:00.825
and we realize that.

00:22:14.755 --> 00:22:18.055
How can we waste?

00:22:18.225 --> 00:22:23.755
How can we waste our energy, our attention into such a

00:22:23.755 --> 00:22:25.055
spontaneous thing like that?

00:22:34.605 --> 00:22:36.845
Specially for old people

00:22:37.815 --> 00:22:40.695
there is no need to think about it anymore, forget it,

00:22:40.695 --> 00:22:42.865
you are very happy that you are alright there.

00:22:43.315 --> 00:22:46.755
Now, just devote your time to something great.

00:22:58.655 --> 00:23:00.795
Actually, I miss nothing, whatsoever.

00:23:08.335 --> 00:23:09.765
The spiritual joy

00:23:10.085 --> 00:23:12.095
is so much greater

00:23:12.405 --> 00:23:15.665
and it's so eternal that we should not seek all this.

00:23:15.665 --> 00:23:19.705
On the contrary, whenever such thoughts come in we should sublimate it.

00:23:36.525 --> 00:23:39.985
You will see once you start doing that, your

00:23:40.095 --> 00:23:42.885
your sensitivity, your perception

00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:46.240
joy will be thousand fold.

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:00.840
And gradually

00:24:00.845 --> 00:24:02.495
you will get over it

00:24:08.895 --> 00:24:10.585
because it is such a

00:24:12.375 --> 00:24:13.915
temporary pleasure,

00:24:14.375 --> 00:24:16.505
that's why people run after it.

00:24:16.505 --> 00:24:19.345
If it was something of eternal nature, one would not

00:24:19.455 --> 00:24:20.455
again go to it.

00:24:31.065 --> 00:24:36.195
But it is in human nature, it is natural, so

00:24:36.195 --> 00:24:42.165
it is being sanctified and one can have it till you are young.

00:24:42.165 --> 00:24:45.595
But then gradually, you must make your pure

00:24:46.235 --> 00:24:49.125
existence so purified

00:24:49.125 --> 00:24:51.675
that they should not enter into your mind at all.

00:25:12.555 --> 00:25:19.385
So when you catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesha, which are very tiny sweet little things,

00:25:19.875 --> 00:25:22.595
you should know that you should be yourself little lightweight,

00:25:22.595 --> 00:25:26.525
otherwise, if you are having all these problems upon yourself,

00:25:26.995 --> 00:25:29.505
He wouldn't like and He might just  again

00:25:29.615 --> 00:25:30.625
throw you down.

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.335
And that your attention should be purified by attention towards Shri Ganesh

00:25:59.695 --> 00:26:02.495
Only people who are

00:26:02.495 --> 00:26:05.265
this kind really also enjoy sex,

00:26:05.265 --> 00:26:08.255
otherwise they cannot because they have so many perversions in their heads,

00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:10.600
I don't know what are they upto.

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:25.720
And that is why

00:26:25.965 --> 00:26:27.235
they rise above,

00:26:28.285 --> 00:26:32.135
that is why they get fed up with it

00:26:32.285 --> 00:26:33.405
after sometime.

00:26:43.015 --> 00:26:48.485
And they mature properly in their own age, otherwise you will find even

00:26:48.485 --> 00:26:49.895
eighty years old people

00:26:50.705 --> 00:26:53.575
shaking their hand on their sticks you see,

00:26:53.785 --> 00:26:56.165
still looking at young girls,

00:26:56.165 --> 00:26:57.355
it's something I cannot understand.

00:27:11.785 --> 00:27:13.665
And they look so stupid,

00:27:14.435 --> 00:27:16.045
they look so stupid.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.560
Everybody laughs at them.

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.600
And young people make fun of them.

00:27:27.555 --> 00:27:30.795
But they feel as if they have become

00:27:30.795 --> 00:27:33.655
something like a hero or

00:27:33.655 --> 00:27:35.805
in that old age suddenly.

00:27:43.485 --> 00:27:45.545
Like they showed once a

00:27:46.875 --> 00:27:47.875
film

00:27:48.565 --> 00:27:52.025
of all the very, very old eighty, eighty above,

00:27:52.725 --> 00:27:55.875
actors and actresses coming to do shake dance

00:27:56.205 --> 00:27:58.915
in a party. To do shake dance

00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:01.600
in a party.

00:28:11.615 --> 00:28:14.045
And from the limousine, they got down

00:28:14.045 --> 00:28:15.605
since then they were shaking.

00:28:21.215 --> 00:28:27.405
And when they came and tried to show they were very much in love and all that, looking

00:28:27.405 --> 00:28:32.065
so stupid that those who watched them were laughing and were rolling with laughter.

00:28:47.165 --> 00:28:49.565
It is so ridiculously clownish,

00:28:50.445 --> 00:28:52.995
but they said we are honest.

00:29:07.385 --> 00:29:09.775
So even if you do these things

00:29:10.220 --> 00:29:16.100
openly or with secrecy or whichever way you do it, it's stupid.

00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:26.200
And that is how,

00:29:26.705 --> 00:29:29.965
when you are not matured of your age

00:29:30.825 --> 00:29:33.725
you are not respected by your children,respected by

00:29:33.725 --> 00:29:38.015
anybody who is younger. He thinks you are stupid because you are not matured enough.

00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:51.855
Now when the fruits are

00:29:52.325 --> 00:29:54.015
in the flower form,

00:29:54.575 --> 00:29:58.745
that time all the fertilization takes place.

00:29:59.795 --> 00:30:03.015
Then at the fruit time they grow as fruits and not as flowers anymore.

00:30:16.515 --> 00:30:19.335
Flowers become fruits

00:30:21.055 --> 00:30:24.015
At the time of flower stage, there is fertilization,

00:30:24.015 --> 00:30:27.425
but not at the time of fruit, you see. Fruit trys to grow

00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.920
Fertilization is where they

00:30:57.540 --> 00:30:58.320
So this is what,

00:30:58.325 --> 00:31:01.295
that maturity is very important

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.080
to reach, that is only possible if you really catch hold of the feet of Shri Ganesh.

00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:23.045
So you remain innocent even in your old age.

00:31:29.695 --> 00:31:32.565
With all this understanding,

00:31:33.235 --> 00:31:36.065
Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

00:31:36.885 --> 00:31:38.485
by which we mature.

00:31:45.055 --> 00:31:46.055
So that thing is there

00:31:46.805 --> 00:31:48.305
in the room, I think I have got that thing

00:31:48.805 --> 00:31:51.055
decoration.

00:31:53.325 --> 00:31:54.425
Now the people

00:31:55.805 --> 00:31:58.745
who are indulging into lust

00:31:59.405 --> 00:32:00.425
have to

00:32:00.925 --> 00:32:05.065
see that they mature in their understanding.

00:32:15.625 --> 00:32:18.615
Then the people who are too much possessive

00:32:19.735 --> 00:32:24.675
of their things, of their possessions, of their

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:35.360
children must also understand that Shri Ganesha gives us wisdom

00:32:35.780 --> 00:32:36.820
to understand,

00:32:37.845 --> 00:32:40.375
that this is not yours.

00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:06.340
So what is carbon is nothing but a burnt wood, that is

00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:08.200
everything is burnt away.

00:33:19.720 --> 00:33:20.920
The wisdom that you get

00:33:21.155 --> 00:33:27.435
is that everything that you see as your own is not yours.

00:33:27.635 --> 00:33:34.095
Everything you have to leave here and go away. You can't take even this paper with you.

00:33:49.785 --> 00:33:52.075
So why are we attached to them,

00:33:52.585 --> 00:33:58.345
let us use it for its own purpose for expressing our joy.

00:34:08.095 --> 00:34:10.085
Now, I'll give you a very

00:34:11.595 --> 00:34:12.965
beautiful example.

00:34:16.545 --> 00:34:19.765
See now how Ritambara Pragnya works.

00:34:24.325 --> 00:34:26.685
See, this necklace that you see

00:34:26.685 --> 00:34:28.500
was made in Italy

00:34:35.020 --> 00:34:36.880
by some realized soul.

00:34:39.675 --> 00:34:40.675
Then,

00:34:41.475 --> 00:34:43.055
this necklace,

00:34:43.955 --> 00:34:47.105
I don't know how it went to India.

00:34:53.705 --> 00:34:54.705
Now,

00:34:55.485 --> 00:34:58.565
the Australians wanted to give me

00:34:58.865 --> 00:34:59.865
a

00:35:00.255 --> 00:35:01.615
Mangal sutra of

00:35:02.145 --> 00:35:04.235
diamond like this, the other one I have.

00:35:12.165 --> 00:35:15.235
And they had collected ten thousand rupees,

00:35:15.295 --> 00:35:18.555
but even half of this size we could not buy

00:35:18.555 --> 00:35:21.685
because there was only one shop open on a sunday.

00:35:21.945 --> 00:35:23.315
situation

00:35:35.455 --> 00:35:38.455
So I looked around and I found

00:35:38.455 --> 00:35:41.485
a very nice gold Mangal sutra

00:35:41.485 --> 00:35:46.415
made out of coral because Australia is Ganesha's land.

00:36:03.165 --> 00:36:06.185
I felt tremendous vibrations around,

00:36:06.185 --> 00:36:07.915
so I went on the back

00:36:09.445 --> 00:36:12.385
because they said, "it is very cheap". So, I said, " alright"

00:36:12.585 --> 00:36:14.915
And there this was placed

00:36:14.915 --> 00:36:17.025
and these earrings there.

00:36:17.455 --> 00:36:19.435
So, we bought all these,

00:36:20.115 --> 00:36:22.505
plus the Mangal sutra,

00:36:22.505 --> 00:36:25.475
plus one more piece which I have in coral

00:36:25.475 --> 00:36:26.475
in the same amount.

00:36:48.335 --> 00:36:51.425
It's not yet finished,

00:36:51.515 --> 00:36:54.085
then it was misplaced

00:36:54.505 --> 00:36:56.925
in Australia,it went into my box

00:36:56.925 --> 00:36:59.795
which was to come to London.

00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.360
So, I couldn't bring it to London

00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:24.640
Now, Thelma came

00:37:25.495 --> 00:37:26.945
from Australia

00:37:27.375 --> 00:37:29.575
and she brought it with her

00:37:29.575 --> 00:37:32.605
and it is now in Italy

00:37:32.605 --> 00:37:33.605
by the artist

00:37:34.025 --> 00:37:36.805
whose spirit could be seeing this

00:37:37.395 --> 00:37:40.345
to gratify him, not only that,

00:37:40.345 --> 00:37:43.805
but also that it is the day of Shri Ganesh

00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:45.380
from Australia.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:10.960
Yes, from Australia,

00:38:10.995 --> 00:38:13.955
this is sent as your brothers,

00:38:13.955 --> 00:38:17.075
the thing they bought made in Italy,

00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:20.600
on the day of Shri Ganesh. Can you have more combinations?

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:51.020
Your brothers and sisters

00:38:51.135 --> 00:38:53.995
from Ganesha's place, you see, the Ganas

00:38:54.455 --> 00:38:56.115
have sent it to

00:38:56.515 --> 00:38:57.625
Devas here

00:38:58.495 --> 00:39:01.635
for the celebration, you are the Devas and they are the Ganas.

00:39:19.635 --> 00:39:20.635
And these are ten,

00:39:22.335 --> 00:39:24.745
ten, eleven and twelve.

00:39:25.315 --> 00:39:28.035
So this represents the heart,

00:39:30.285 --> 00:39:32.515
the dharma, ten

00:39:32.885 --> 00:39:33.885
and all

00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:36.200
put together is the heart.

00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:43.800
The whole of Europe

00:39:52.435 --> 00:39:55.825
and in addition to these two is the twelve, it's the heart : England.

00:40:04.285 --> 00:40:06.985
All are represented here

00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:13.975
Now you should be able to read through

00:40:14.655 --> 00:40:17.665
the beautiful working of

00:40:17.665 --> 00:40:19.825
Ritambara Pragnya which is very subtle.

00:40:20.235 --> 00:40:22.845
And then you'll start enjoying the little, little things

00:40:22.845 --> 00:40:25.695
it plays to make you very happy

00:40:26.025 --> 00:40:30.185
and to give you what some artist must have done it long time back,

00:40:31.285 --> 00:40:33.105
which his desire was

00:40:33.495 --> 00:40:34.495
to fulfill.

00:40:59.415 --> 00:41:02.325
No, this is also we should say,

00:41:02.325 --> 00:41:03.780
is the work of Shri Ganesha.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:15.220
He resides as Omkara in the Ritambara Pragnya.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:26.625
He resides on the electromagnetic forces as the vibrations in the matter,

00:41:33.385 --> 00:41:34.385
in every atom.

00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:44.520
He resides in every ripple of our emotions which gives us joy.

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.460
And he resides

00:42:03.745 --> 00:42:06.905
as a beautiful decoration of the Kundalini because

00:42:06.905 --> 00:42:09.825
she has the red and gold colour just like my sari.

00:42:21.120 --> 00:42:23.400
So, as the colour of Kundalini he resides.

00:42:28.060 --> 00:42:29.140
But at Sahastrara,

00:42:30.765 --> 00:42:33.295
he becomes the joy.

00:42:38.385 --> 00:42:41.365
At Muladhara as the fragrance,

00:42:46.175 --> 00:42:49.115
and every memory of mine

00:42:49.115 --> 00:42:52.505
should give you fragrance because he is the Lord of memory.

00:43:01.875 --> 00:43:04.735
So, this is how he manages everything

00:43:04.735 --> 00:43:06.205
so beautifully.

00:43:12.215 --> 00:43:14.125
He is such a innocent

00:43:16.425 --> 00:43:18.865
person who plays around

00:43:19.105 --> 00:43:20.105
his beauty

00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:21.780
to make us happy.

00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.915
Our children should also make us very happy

00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.300
if we have brought them up properly.

00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:46.180
But if we have been

00:43:46.185 --> 00:43:48.875
all the time busy with lust and greed,

00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:51.040
the children cannot be good children.

00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:04.400
They cannot represent

00:44:04.705 --> 00:44:06.855
Ganesha tatwa as it should be.

00:44:15.125 --> 00:44:17.435
So, today is a great day

00:44:17.435 --> 00:44:20.275
that we are establishing Shri Ganesha

00:44:20.275 --> 00:44:21.545
in Italy.

00:44:30.955 --> 00:44:33.205
We did this in Switzerland

00:44:33.940 --> 00:44:34.940
and now in Italy.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.940
This should give you

00:44:42.105 --> 00:44:43.515
the power of innocence,

00:44:43.965 --> 00:44:46.925
the power of purity,

00:44:46.925 --> 00:44:47.925
the power of wisdom.

00:44:58.255 --> 00:45:01.405
It should give you the art of playfulness of joy.

00:45:13.815 --> 00:45:20.745
And that special quality of turning everything into something

00:45:20.935 --> 00:45:21.935
fragrant.

00:45:29.755 --> 00:45:30.755
May God bless you all.
