Title: Talk on evening before Sahastrara Puja
Location: Thredbo, Australia

2
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:04,810
Date: 2.5.1987

3
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:24,560
So very nice to see you all here, all my children.
Your love out beats me. I really find no words

4
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:46,830
to express my feelings. The way you have taken
to Sahaja Yoga and the way you have established

5
00:02:53,750 --> 00:03:00,750
yourself in Sahaj Yog. I know it is very difficult
to spread Sahaja Yoga. Everywhere it is difficult

6
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:13,220
because you know these are the times of kaliyuga.
I am not tired of the journey so much as the

7
00:03:21,340 --> 00:03:28,340
fighting the evil forces around us. When I
came to Canberra, I felt the left swadhistana

8
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:38,819
very strong, so strong that I could not walk
few steps and I asked them what’s the matter?

9
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:47,519
They told me that TM, there is some Chinmoy
fellow, they are very strong here. Apart from

10
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:56,430
that there are other spiritualist forces which
they are announcing in the newspapers.

11
00:03:56,599 --> 00:04:03,599
It’s shocking that human beings take to
these horrible things so easily and try to

12
00:04:08,870 --> 00:04:15,870
work it out. When you study the reason why
they take to these horrible things then you

13
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:26,220
realize one thing that these things promise
quick results. Like supposing somebody’s

14
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:36,740
son has been lost. So, they will say, “All
right. You come to our group, we’ll find

15
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:38,710
it out for you.”

16
00:04:38,710 --> 00:04:43,480
Or else, somebody says, “I am under a great
strain.”

17
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:47,940
“All right. You come to our group, we will
remove your strains.”

18
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:54,940
It’s very easy to remove the strains by
putting a entity, what we call the bhoots,

19
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:04,890
into someone so that the bhoot takes over
for the time being. But, here the seeker is

20
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:12,520
not a deep person. Those who were deep people
came back from all these horrible people.

21
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:19,890
With the TM, I can tell you, we have been
able to salvage some people, not all of them.

22
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:29,700
When first it was brought to my notice, I
had a meeting in England and we had from TM

23
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:39,650
at least hundred people. Out of which we can
say about ten to twelve people we have been

24
00:05:40,700 --> 00:05:47,700
able to salvage. But the growth, spiritual
growth in them was very slow and they were

25
00:05:48,660 --> 00:05:55,660
just frightened of Me. They would not look
at Me. They had awe about Me. Whenever they

26
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,780
saw me they would shake. There is one fellow,
Chinese, who came from TM, and I think Rustom

27
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:12,680
was there, and he just took My name and he
jumped under a table and landed himself outside

28
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:22,440
in the lounge and they started looking at
him where has he disappeared. With this Chinese

29
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:30,510
fellow, we tried with him, but he used to
shake and horrible [UNCLEAR], poor thing.

30
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:38,200
Then he left Sahaja Yoga in a way and somebody
met him in a restaurant or in a book shop

31
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:52,250
and somebody met him there, and they asked
him, “How do you feel? How do you feel about

32
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,320
Mother?” He said, “Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho! She
is a tremendous power.”

33
00:06:57,320 --> 00:07:04,320
So, you see, they are so weak, they are so
gone down. It’s very difficult to bring

34
00:07:08,810 --> 00:07:14,890
them to normal conditions. Within two, three
years they become recluses. They are even

35
00:07:14,890 --> 00:07:21,890
afraid of, what you call garlic. If you show
them the garlic they start shaking. If you

36
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:29,200
show them the lemon they start shaking. They
become recluses. We get few people from there,

37
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:36,580
TM, but their bhoots are so strong that they
will not stick on to us much. Even they come

38
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:43,580
down for a short time, again they go back.
So, this is the situation with these TM people.

39
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:50,990
And with this Chinmoy fellow I had an encounter
in America and there the people they came

40
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:01,800
and told me that “Why this Chinmoy is here
and why doesn’t your husband tell to Secretary

41
00:08:01,870 --> 00:08:07,050
General about it?” And you know who was
the Secretary General that time, [Wol Dahm?]

42
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:13,820
and all the rest of it. And they were all
crazy people. How Wol Dahm is now being cheated

43
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:19,130
by people and now he is not allowed to go
to America and all that. Actually his luck

44
00:08:19,130 --> 00:08:26,130
was not so bad but this bhoots, you see, they
made him so funny that he just could not come

45
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:33,610
back to his normal self. Now this gentleman
was not so much into this Chinmoy but there

46
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:39,879
was one south Indian gentleman who was in
the UN and he said that “This Chinmoy is

47
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:46,879
very good.” This Chinmoy used to play tennis,
used to swim, used to drink, have women, he

48
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:54,459
was a real yanky and despite that people said,
“Oh! He is great because he knows how to

49
00:08:55,939 --> 00:09:02,939
speak well.” So, all those speech loving
people he got. That’s another style of people

50
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:11,920
who are not seekers but who just want somebody
to talk, talk, and talk. He could talk on

51
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:18,920
Gita, he could talk on this, he could talk
on every kind of thing. Now, the big difference

52
00:09:19,199 --> 00:09:26,199
is, in Sahaja Yoga you have to accept Me.
There you don’t have to accept anyone. As

53
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:35,250
long as you accept Gita, as long as you accept
Bible, as long as you accept something – is

54
00:09:35,250 --> 00:09:42,250
not there, which is dead, which is finished.
So, these people are interested only in your

55
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:43,560
money.

56
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:50,560
So, they don’t worry about these old, we
should say, prophets who are dead now or we

57
00:09:52,060 --> 00:09:57,240
can say the incarnations who are dead. They
have nothing to do. Just they describe them,

58
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:03,829
take the money. That’s they want. They only
want to have money, money, money and money.

59
00:10:03,829 --> 00:10:08,899
They are not interested in your welfare or
anything. They have no idea of Kundalini,

60
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,920
they cannot raise your Kundalini, they cannot
give you realization, they cannot look after

61
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,870
you – nothing of the kind. Only thing what
they want, whatever money you have they should

62
00:10:18,870 --> 00:10:25,870
have it. And the way they do it is a very
camouflage sort of a drama they play, that

63
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:33,420
they can deliver the goods. What are the goods
they are going to deliver to you? Except Self-Realization.

64
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:43,490
Even the people who talked of Self-Realization
never gave Self-Realization to anyone. I have

65
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:50,490
seen this Yogananda’s disciples. The early
ones, they had to cut their tongues because

66
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:58,639
according to him, in his own kriyayoga, you
had to put back your tongue here for a khechri

67
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:03,850
and that’s why they had to cut their tongue.
They cannot speak, they cannot do anything.

68
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:09,790
They are just like dogs, you see, wagging
their tails. Very good people, they are doctors,

69
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:16,600
architects, very good people. All these things
have happened to all these great seekers,

70
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:23,600
I should say, but they were stupid to accept
anyone like that. First of all, you must see

71
00:11:24,249 --> 00:11:31,249
what are other, are doing others, say other
disciples are doing. How are they, majority

72
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:39,069
of them? In Sahaja Yoga also we might get
somebody a very useless person and might get

73
00:11:39,069 --> 00:11:46,069
somebody a very low grade or a very low caliber
personality. We do get on the periphery, we

74
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:53,279
do get. But they should see other people who
are seriously involved in Sahaja Yoga. How

75
00:11:53,279 --> 00:12:00,050
they are behaving? What is their way of doing
it? And how their life is? What have they

76
00:12:00,050 --> 00:12:05,819
achieved? What powers have they achieved?
And what kind of a life they lead? That is

77
00:12:05,819 --> 00:12:09,689
how you should judge the person to whom they
have to do.

78
00:12:09,689 --> 00:12:15,800
I am sorry that this Canberra is so full of
Left Swadistana and if you allow these things

79
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:20,529
to continue I don’t know what will happen
to your government. It will all go to dogs

80
00:12:20,529 --> 00:12:27,319
if this stupid thing is allowed to work out
because all those booths will jump on all

81
00:12:27,319 --> 00:12:34,319
these civil servants and serious things can
happen. I am quite surprised how it is allowed

82
00:12:34,649 --> 00:12:41,649
in Australia where is the land of Shri Ganesha.
As it is I am here now, I am sure something

83
00:12:43,529 --> 00:12:50,529
will happen and they will give up that. But
as far as coming to Sahaja Yoga, I would say,

84
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,959
it’s a headache. You better give yourselves
a bandhan before touching them anywhere near

85
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:02,059
because they will give you lot of trouble.
I have had lots of trouble with them. So much

86
00:13:02,059 --> 00:13:08,649
so, we had to leave one of our ashrams. You
see, we had three persons in that ashram from

87
00:13:08,649 --> 00:13:15,600
TM and they used to scream so much and this
jumping about was so much that the neighbors

88
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,230
told us that, ”You better get out from here”
and because of them we had to get out. All

89
00:13:20,230 --> 00:13:22,759
kinds of funny things they do.

90
00:13:22,759 --> 00:13:28,930
First time I saw these TM people, were in
a hall, and they took the first chairs. First

91
00:13:28,930 --> 00:13:33,910
row they were sitting there. As soon as I
started speaking they all started jumping

92
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:39,279
like jack in the box. I was wondering, “What‘s
the matter? Is perfectly alright? Who are

93
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,809
these people?” I had never seen such a thing
before. I was quite surprised that who are

94
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:46,860
these people jumping like this one by one.

95
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:52,230
Then I asked them, they said, “We do TM
and we are doing siddha course.”

96
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:58,160
“Siddha course? Stupid people you are, that’s
what you are.” And out of these 6 or 7 people

97
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:04,689
who were jumping we could save about, I should
say, two or three.

98
00:14:04,689 --> 00:14:09,279
So, those people who have gone to that you
shouldn’t worry so much about them. But,

99
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,059
of course, if it is gone to the government
it is better to beat the government with shoes

100
00:14:14,059 --> 00:14:18,660
and give bandhan to the government so that
they don’t get entangled with it. But is

101
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:25,660
serious thing and I have to work it out myself
on those lines because I was quite shocked

102
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:32,879
that in Canberra they have such bad vibrations.
I came to Canberra much before with my husband

103
00:14:33,809 --> 00:14:37,559
and I told him that “The vibrations here
are very, very bad.”

104
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:40,019
So he said, ”All the capital cities are
like that.”

105
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:46,569
I said, “But it seems rather funny that
both the centers are catching so badly.”

106
00:14:46,569 --> 00:14:51,619
And I couldn’t walk that time also and today
also the same thing happened to Me.

107
00:14:51,619 --> 00:14:58,619
Now, we have many other people who are seeking
God. They live in the villages. These people

108
00:14:59,779 --> 00:15:05,899
have not gone to the villages because they
wanted only rich people, monied people. So,

109
00:15:05,899 --> 00:15:11,430
there are many people in the villages who
haven’t yet received their Self-Realization

110
00:15:11,430 --> 00:15:16,939
and they can receive their Self-Realization
without any difficulties. You can go there

111
00:15:16,939 --> 00:15:23,939
and talk to them and get them realized because
they are not people for whom these rakshashas

112
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:33,110
are waiting. We have to give them realization.
Once you give realization to people in the

113
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:39,329
villages, things will change. The atmosphere
will change and you find lots of people coming

114
00:15:39,329 --> 00:15:44,439
to Sahaja Yoga. So, I would say, I am very
happy that in Sydney itself we have so many

115
00:15:44,439 --> 00:15:50,149
centers and in other cities you have so many
centers. But now we have to reach the villages

116
00:15:50,149 --> 00:15:57,149
and see them. They are innocent, simple people
living in the villages in a very simple manner

117
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:04,569
and is better to give them proper attention
because they are the ones who will get realization.

118
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:14,740
Then the children, children should be attended
to. They can be very nicely brought to Sahaj

119
00:16:14,779 --> 00:16:20,769
and because there may be many of them who
are already born realized. So the children

120
00:16:20,769 --> 00:16:25,639
can be brought into Sahaja Yoga but not without
the permission of their parents because the

121
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:32,639
laws and regulations are such that we may
land up in the prison without asking the permission

122
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,779
of the father or mother. So, one has to be
very careful.

123
00:16:35,779 --> 00:16:42,779
The another are the adolescent boys and girls
who are studying in the colleges and who are

124
00:16:44,869 --> 00:16:51,569
not yet exposed so much to all these bad things.
They might be drug addicts little bit or may

125
00:16:51,569 --> 00:16:58,569
be other addiction they might be having but
they are not yet touched by these horrible

126
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:06,839
evil forces. So, you can just attend to them.
You can also advertise that you can look after

127
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:13,839
people who are addicted to all these drugs
and all that. You can relieve them. If you

128
00:17:13,860 --> 00:17:20,430
are allowed to do that you can advertise,
get those people and if you give them realization

129
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:27,430
they might be able to get over their addiction
completely. There is a doctor, Dr. Wells,

130
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:32,730
in London who has now become a very big doctor
in charge of a hospital of addiction. So,

131
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:38,520
I said, “What do you do to them? How do
you manage this addiction business?”

132
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:44,770
He said, “In their absence I beat them with
shoes, that’s all and they are all getting

133
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:46,040
rid of their addiction.”

134
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:52,830
So, you can attend to those boys who are now
grown up boys and are taking to drugs and

135
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,980
things like that. They are seekers. That’s
why they are going to these things. I think

136
00:17:57,980 --> 00:18:03,690
this kind of an attitude if you have that
you are not going to attend to people who

137
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:10,310
are already with some gurus and with something
and encounter them. But attend to people who

138
00:18:10,310 --> 00:18:17,310
by their innocence have fallen into some problems
or to the innocent people in the villages

139
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:22,690
or children who are innocent. I am sure you
can prosper faster.

140
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:29,110
So, Sahaja Yoga is growing very much faster
here and in a way in a city it is growing.

141
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:35,160
We can grow much faster, I think, the way
there are people, so many people, are in the

142
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:42,160
villages and in the countryside; in a very
simple way they live. As for Myself, to come

143
00:18:44,730 --> 00:18:51,040
to Australia is such an excitement and such
a joy because last year I could not come and

144
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:57,550
this year when they said it was a Sahastrar
Puja and had to perform here and be there,

145
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:04,550
I was very happy. Tomorrow we have to have
that Puja. I was also a person in a way you

146
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:16,590
can say, a seeker, because I was trying to
find out a method, the way, by which I could

147
00:19:17,330 --> 00:19:23,330
really give en-masse realization. I could
give realization to many people at the same

148
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:30,330
time and for that I was really working very,
very hard, understanding lots of people, human

149
00:19:32,090 --> 00:19:38,400
beings, and out of them I found bureaucrats
are the worse. As you have lots of bureaucrats

150
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:44,160
in this Canberra, may be, that they are not
so good because they have to compromise all

151
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:51,160
the time. They have to say, “Yes sir, yes
sir,” and despite their resistance, despite

152
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:59,020
their not liking, to say that, they are poor
things, pushed into a job where they have

153
00:20:06,150 --> 00:20:13,150
to work it out because after all job is important.
When all these things become important, the

154
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:21,560
person’s personality suffers a lot. That’s
what I found that the bureaucrats who are

155
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,130
seeking all the time power, go after the man
who can give them some more power, in the

156
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:32,760
sense the power not of the divine but over
the people that they can dominate more people

157
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:39,260
and they can manage more people. And that’s
why these people fall into these groups because

158
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:45,250
in the beginning they feel relaxed in a way
and they dominate many people as there are

159
00:20:45,250 --> 00:20:51,360
booths sitting with them who give them ideas.
But then they get tired of them and then they

160
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:58,360
fall sick. So, many people commit suicide
also, suicide. I was told that suicide is

161
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,920
maximum, suicide cases are maximum in Canberra.
The reason is this only that you don’t know

162
00:21:07,210 --> 00:21:13,110
what to do with yourself. You suffer from
some sort of a miserable disease. You don’t

163
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:20,110
know how to get out of it and then you commit
suicide. So, all these things are connected

164
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:29,550
with the attack of the evil forces and these
evil forces attack you in a very subtle manner.

165
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:38,560
So, one should be careful as to mature. One
has to mature in Sahaja Yoga so that nothing

166
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:46,180
can affect them, nothing can trouble them,
nothing can bother them. One has to mature.

167
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,820
The maturity should be such as like Mine.
If I catch it, I mean, I deliberately catch

168
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,700
it and then I try to solve the problem. But
if you cannot do that then you should not

169
00:21:56,700 --> 00:22:02,590
catch also because you will suffer little
bit by catching them.

170
00:22:02,590 --> 00:22:08,850
Now, for tomorrow’s puja I hope you will
all be ready and you will all enjoy tomorrow’s

171
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:13,620
puja. Had a very nice puja in Pune which I
had to perform on the thirteenth because it

172
00:22:13,620 --> 00:22:20,620
is the date called Akshaya Thrithya, means
undestructible third day of the moon. That’s

173
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:28,740
actually nobody knew, but it is the puja of
the Kundalini. That day everybody felt very,

174
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:35,740
very clear. Very clear. Puja was hardly for
about half an hour, the real puja of the Kundalini.

175
00:22:38,920 --> 00:22:45,700
But everybody felt extremely clear and beautiful.
So, that sort of puja we should do tomorrow

176
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:52,700
also, if possible, so that we’ll have the
feelings of Sahastrara completely opened out

177
00:22:55,810 --> 00:23:01,750
because even if Sahastrara is opened, the
rest of the chakras, if they are caught up

178
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:07,450
then you have problems. It’s better to clear
out all the chakras and then the Sahastrara.

179
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:12,560
So, tomorrow we’ll do the puja in that fashion
and I hope it will work out very well for

180
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:13,490
all of you.

181
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:20,490
I hope I have been rather late for all of
you and I am not taking too much of your time

182
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:31,680
here. Tomorrow I think it should be, you see,
actually you’ll be surprised that this is

183
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:42,660
the time I opened the Sahastrara in India.
This is exactly the time because just now

184
00:23:45,230 --> 00:23:52,230
is 6.30 there, 6.35 and about 6.30, I opened
Sahastrara. So, you can imagine this is the

185
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:59,760
time I opened the Sahastrara there and 

186
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:25,120
this is the time we are sitting on 

187
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:22,100
the other side of the world and celebrating
that day, that great day 

188
00:31:07,210 --> 00:31:14,210
of Sahastrara being opened out. It’s a very
great day in the history of spirituality,

189
00:31:49,990 --> 00:31:56,990
very great day for the whole world. They will
realize one day what 

190
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,700
it was. Such a big time that Sahastrara could

191
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:39,120
be opened for masses. Not only that but you
are empowered to do that great work.

192
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:44,730
May God bless you.
