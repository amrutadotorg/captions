00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:12.533
Now, we are starting a New Year,

00:37:12.678 --> 00:37:20.616
and I wish you all a very happy and
prosperous New Year.

00:37:28.018 --> 00:37:40.593
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very
deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:48.528 --> 00:37:58.999
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all
have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:59.215 --> 00:38:10.844
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am
sure you are doing meditation, introspection

00:38:12.208 --> 00:38:18.566
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals,
I should say.

00:38:23.308 --> 00:38:33.670
In this New Year, I’ll think there is
greater chance

00:38:35.435 --> 00:38:39.607
for you to do much better,

00:38:40.325 --> 00:38:48.114
because all those years of ordeals are
over.

00:38:53.200 --> 00:39:02.983
We are now entering into the New Era. I say
now the Satya Yuga is established.

00:39:08.209 --> 00:39:15.024
In the beginning you may not feel
the atmosphere

00:39:15.764 --> 00:39:21.165
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

00:39:21.366 --> 00:39:28.319
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all
clearing out

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:36.305
and all the people who are dangerous
for your spiritual life,

00:39:36.506 --> 00:39:46.953
for your national life, for your family
life, will have to take back their way;

00:39:47.154 --> 00:39:50.711
they cannot be successful here.

00:39:58.319 --> 00:40:05.680
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far
they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:40:05.881 --> 00:40:10.132
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:40:10.333 --> 00:40:16.852
There should be many more waiting for you
this year,

00:40:17.053 --> 00:40:23.852
and maybe this year, if you all decide to
work it out, I am sure

00:40:24.053 --> 00:40:32.218
you can get lots of people who will be
saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

00:40:32.419 --> 00:40:40.344
This is going to be your vow on the New
Year day,

00:40:40.547 --> 00:40:47.696
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga
in a new way,

00:40:47.897 --> 00:40:52.069
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

00:40:52.270 --> 00:41:00.173
For that, first thing is needed is your
Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

00:41:00.374 --> 00:41:07.493
This collectivity has to be extremely well
built-in, well made,

00:41:07.694 --> 00:41:13.225
well understood and absolutely loveable.

00:41:14.194 --> 00:41:20.805
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga,
because practically all your jealousies,

00:41:21.006 --> 00:41:30.537
all your baser ideas have been completely
washed out by your Kundalini.

00:41:30.738 --> 00:41:37.477
She has transformed you, you are different
people; you are very, very different.

00:41:37.678 --> 00:41:46.265
Not only that, but you have now understood
yourselves.

00:41:46.466 --> 00:41:52.305
You are knowing your Self. And all those
who know their self

00:41:52.506 --> 00:41:55.994
cannot fight with each other.

00:41:57.155 --> 00:42:05.155
Because this Self is the reflection of one
person,

00:42:05.356 --> 00:42:13.390
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can
you fight?

00:42:13.591 --> 00:42:21.155
When He is within your heart, how can you
fight with each other?

00:42:21.356 --> 00:42:25.133
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting
with yourself.

00:42:25.334 --> 00:42:29.727
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

00:42:29.928 --> 00:42:38.186
So all the fights and all the funny things
that you have been thinking about

00:42:38.686 --> 00:42:44.272
will of course disappear, no doubt. But
you’ll become very dynamic.

00:42:44.473 --> 00:42:48.710
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you
have to rise;

00:42:48.911 --> 00:42:54.780
just you have to expect your Self
to manifest.

00:42:54.981 --> 00:43:01.579
You can become very, very collective,
progressive

00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:06.209
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:06.410 --> 00:43:15.071
You have been given Realization; you have
been given the knowledge of Realization;

00:43:15.272 --> 00:43:23.016
whatever was possible has been done
for your health and prosperity,

00:43:23.217 --> 00:43:32.608
but now it’s your duty to repay to
the Divine by your creative methods.

00:43:32.809 --> 00:43:36.194
You have to be very creative.

00:43:36.395 --> 00:43:44.461
You'll find so many people in this world
are full of lots of problems,

00:43:44.662 --> 00:43:51.093
which you have got out of it. But you can
help them.

00:43:51.294 --> 00:43:56.092
You don’t need any help because you are
yourself full of power –

00:43:56.293 --> 00:44:03.220
power of Divinity within you. This Divine
power should be used.

00:44:03.421 --> 00:44:09.134
It’s not given just to be rusted. This
power has to be used.

00:44:09.334 --> 00:44:13.385
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming
powerful?

00:44:13.586 --> 00:44:18.417
Supposing we have electrical power here,
and it doesn’t even give light,

00:44:18.618 --> 00:44:22.237
so what’s the use of having electrical
power?

00:44:22.438 --> 00:44:28.330
So the power that you have is for
the emancipation of human beings.

00:44:30.787 --> 00:44:38.534
It is for you to raise the Kundalini
of people – you can do it.

00:44:38.735 --> 00:44:41.721
One person can do it for thousands!

00:44:41.922 --> 00:44:48.222
And I hope now you take up this
responsibility upon yourself.

00:44:48.423 --> 00:44:54.278
This would be the greatest blessing for
you, for Sahaja Yoga

00:44:54.479 --> 00:45:02.231
and for the whole world. Because in My
vision, we have to change the whole world.

00:45:02.432 --> 00:45:06.176
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can
achieve it or not.

00:45:06.377 --> 00:45:09.964
But if you people really join hands with Me,

00:45:10.165 --> 00:45:15.778
with full effort, it will work out.

00:45:15.979 --> 00:45:25.270
Firstly I hear many people don’t go
to meditation, into collective meditation.

00:45:25.471 --> 00:45:33.200
They do not join together. It’s surprising
after so many years of work I’ve done –

00:45:33.401 --> 00:45:38.958
thirty years I’ve been working, and there
are some, some people

00:45:39.159 --> 00:45:45.917
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t
understand your responsibility.

00:45:46.118 --> 00:45:50.395
You have to meditate collectively.

00:45:50.596 --> 00:45:55.518
Whenever there is collective meditation
you must join that.

00:45:55.719 --> 00:46:03.932
You can also start something in your areas,
a collective meditation.

00:46:04.133 --> 00:46:10.182
And it will work out. Many people who are
in Sahaja Yoga

00:46:10.383 --> 00:46:14.018
are now meditating, I can make them out.

00:46:14.219 --> 00:46:18.417
I know who are the ones who are meditating
and who are not.

00:46:18.618 --> 00:46:22.278
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then
you come out

00:46:22.479 --> 00:46:27.833
with other problems like my mother’s,
father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

00:46:28.034 --> 00:46:34.020
There’s no need to worry about that. Even
if you are a realized soul,

00:46:34.221 --> 00:46:41.237
and when you are connected with the Divine,
even your own wish will be fulfilled.

00:46:41.438 --> 00:46:49.520
But it does not. Why? Because you still do
not understand what you have become.

00:46:49.721 --> 00:46:56.065
You first try giving Realizations to others.
See what joy you feel.

00:46:56.266 --> 00:47:01.536
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get
in anything else.

00:47:01.737 --> 00:47:06.424
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may
have,

00:47:06.625 --> 00:47:11.004
you cannot get this joy of giving
Realization.

00:47:11.205 --> 00:47:16.676
And you will be so very happy; not because
you expect anything,

00:47:16.877 --> 00:47:23.481
you want anything, nothing of the kind –
but only thing is pure joy –

00:47:23.682 --> 00:47:31.253
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis.
This is what you are there.

00:47:31.454 --> 00:47:40.458
This is what the Divine wants you to do.
Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

00:47:40.659 --> 00:47:45.520
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure
my sister… ”

00:47:45.721 --> 00:47:50.051
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then
somebody says,

00:47:50.252 --> 00:47:56.801
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife
says that… so the husband says this...

00:47:57.002 --> 00:48:00.222
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

00:48:00.423 --> 00:48:04.168
You are now above everything, above all
these things.

00:48:04.369 --> 00:48:09.598
And you have become absolutely powerful,
believe Me.

00:48:09.799 --> 00:48:15.206
If you haven’t used your power, then how
will you know what powers you have got?

00:48:15.407 --> 00:48:20.083
It’s as simple as that. Those who have
used it

00:48:20.284 --> 00:48:25.200
go on telling Me what miracles they had,
what things have happened to them,

00:48:25.401 --> 00:48:31.268
how they were protected, whatever they
wanted – how they got it.

00:48:31.659 --> 00:48:38.364
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be
hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

00:48:38.565 --> 00:48:41.753
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows
you are a hypocritical.

00:48:41.954 --> 00:48:47.145
It is for your good, for your growth you
have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:47.346 --> 00:48:51.520
It’s not for somebody else that you are
doing it, but for yourself.

00:48:51.721 --> 00:48:58.997
When people are that powerful I am
amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

00:48:59.198 --> 00:49:04.050
But they must meditate, and they must join
collective meditation.

00:49:04.251 --> 00:49:08.729
Most of the people don’t join collective
meditation. I am surprised.

00:49:08.930 --> 00:49:14.118
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is
no sufficient space,

00:49:14.319 --> 00:49:19.166
so people have to come twice, either
Saturday or Sunday;

00:49:19.367 --> 00:49:22.568
some of them have to wait outside –
doesn’t matter.

00:49:23.586 --> 00:49:26.932
But going for the collective meditation,

00:49:27.133 --> 00:49:33.330
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing
there. Vibrations are flowing there.

00:49:33.531 --> 00:49:40.899
I am there. It’s not that you are just
going there just as a ritual.

00:49:41.133 --> 00:49:49.094
Problem is you people don’t realize that you
have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:49.295 --> 00:49:56.307
responsible for giving Realizations
to others and attend

00:49:56.508 --> 00:50:03.657
all the programs you have of meditation.

00:50:03.858 --> 00:50:08.198
With collective meditation you get
all right.

00:50:08.399 --> 00:50:14.772
All your problems are solved if you go to
the collective meditation regularly –

00:50:14.973 --> 00:50:21.409
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t
go; you will write letters to Me,

00:50:21.610 --> 00:50:26.743
you want to meet Me. This is not going
to help.

00:50:26.944 --> 00:50:31.987
You may come and trouble Me like that, or
do something like that, but doesn’t help.

00:50:32.188 --> 00:50:41.930
What helps that you help yourself. Next
year is going to be a great year for you.

00:50:42.985 --> 00:50:48.992
In the West now I was surprised how things
are spreading fast.

00:50:49.274 --> 00:50:58.618
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

00:50:58.819 --> 00:51:05.962
Once they get Realization, they understand
the value of Realization.

00:51:06.163 --> 00:51:11.744
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t
want anything.

00:51:11.945 --> 00:51:17.291
They’ve never desired for anything. Though
they have gone through horrible

00:51:17.492 --> 00:51:24.540
problems of communism, and now this
reaction to that.

00:51:24.741 --> 00:51:33.627
Despite that, all these five countries
which I call as ‘real’

00:51:33.828 --> 00:51:40.914
Divine countries, because the way they have
accepted it.

00:51:41.524 --> 00:51:45.266
They are poor according to the modern
standards,

00:51:45.467 --> 00:51:50.242
but from their heart they are very,
very rich.

00:51:50.516 --> 00:51:56.758
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga,
they are very, very rich.

00:51:56.959 --> 00:52:03.290
And their scientists are so well qualified.
In every type of thing now,

00:52:03.491 --> 00:52:10.744
there is one scientist who has come
to India and who has discovered a method

00:52:10.945 --> 00:52:16.088
by which you can see all the chakras, and
the Kundalini

00:52:16.289 --> 00:52:22.174
and the obstructions and everything –
something he can show you.

00:52:22.375 --> 00:52:30.190
While our scientists are busy opposing Me.
Little knowledge is very dangerous.

00:52:30.391 --> 00:52:34.118
They don’t want to see what I am doing and
how I am doing it.

00:52:34.319 --> 00:52:40.416
They just want to criticize Me – all
so-called intellectuals.

00:52:40.617 --> 00:52:42.790
Especially in Maharashtra,

00:52:42.991 --> 00:52:47.252
the intellectuals – I think they are
something has gone wrong with their heads.

00:52:47.453 --> 00:52:53.073
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just
beyond them.

00:52:53.274 --> 00:52:59.471
What has happened to them I don’t know,
but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:59.672 --> 00:53:05.073
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with
their rituals.

00:53:05.274 --> 00:53:09.079
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up,
take their baths, do this,

00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:14.198
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

00:53:14.399 --> 00:53:18.837
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes
to Me,

00:53:19.038 --> 00:53:22.399
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do
any rituals,

00:53:22.600 --> 00:53:25.634
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

00:53:25.835 --> 00:53:30.385
As if doing by that you mean you are
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:53:30.586 --> 00:53:34.916
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing
can happen to you.

00:53:35.117 --> 00:53:39.010
But you have been just under wrong
impression.

00:53:39.211 --> 00:53:44.441
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go
to wrong places

00:53:44.642 --> 00:53:51.785
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never
helped anyone.

00:53:51.986 --> 00:53:58.394
So first you have to empty yourself. If you
are already filled with these ideas,

00:53:58.595 --> 00:54:03.931
these age old ideas, and you are still
carrying on with them,

00:54:04.132 --> 00:54:06.316
how can the Divine be filled?

00:54:06.517 --> 00:54:12.785
If there’s a pot already full of water or
anything – you cannot fill it.

00:54:12.986 --> 00:54:20.736
So you have to empty it completely. Empty
yourself, empty your mind.

00:54:20.937 --> 00:54:29.324
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can
take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

00:54:29.525 --> 00:54:34.910
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst
thing,

00:54:35.111 --> 00:54:40.933
because reaction comes through your Agnya,
as I told you the other day,

00:54:41.134 --> 00:54:49.728
and it is due to your conditioning or due
to your ego.

00:54:49.929 --> 00:54:54.785
So some people react because of their
conditioning,

00:54:54.986 --> 00:55:04.113
and some people react because of their ego.
So why should you react to anything?

00:55:04.314 --> 00:55:09.019
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting.
You just watch.

00:55:09.220 --> 00:55:16.253
See how beautifully they have made
beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

00:55:16.454 --> 00:55:20.714
What is the need – some will find some
faults, somebody will say

00:55:20.915 --> 00:55:23.853
this should not have been there, how did
they manage this,

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:31.456
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy
of its creation is there.

00:55:31.657 --> 00:55:37.042
And you should be able to see it, feel it,
enjoy it.

00:55:37.243 --> 00:55:42.321
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise
you are not.

00:55:42.522 --> 00:55:48.416
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:55:48.617 --> 00:55:52.924
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

00:55:53.125 --> 00:55:59.212
I think there are so many various styles
of Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:59.540 --> 00:56:06.527
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little
plus, somebody’s like that.

00:56:06.728 --> 00:56:12.439
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

00:56:12.640 --> 00:56:18.324
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous
and happy.

00:56:18.525 --> 00:56:23.527
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting
angry with others,

00:56:23.728 --> 00:56:28.579
all these things are going on, and he
thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:36.370
In our Divine University we have no
degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

00:56:36.572 --> 00:56:39.495
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got
your Realization.

00:56:39.696 --> 00:56:45.462
If the Kundalini has burst opened here –
it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:45.663 --> 00:56:52.195
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real
Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:52.396 --> 00:56:58.993
It only depends when you are joyous and you
are anxious

00:56:59.194 --> 00:57:04.822
to give Realizations to others. You want
to share your Realization,

00:57:05.023 --> 00:57:11.493
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself.
If that is not your condition,

00:57:11.694 --> 00:57:15.679
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.905
You should find out how many people you
have given Realization.

00:57:20.106 --> 00:57:26.134
It’s very important. Because next year, as
I’ve said, is a very important,

00:57:26.335 --> 00:57:31.664
very, very important year.

00:57:31.865 --> 00:57:42.158
In that year I would like to see all of you
going round and giving Realization.

00:57:42.359 --> 00:57:49.355
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus
who are getting exposed one by one.

00:57:50.215 --> 00:57:58.267
If you see their attitude, anywhere you
meet them – once I was travelling

00:57:58.468 --> 00:58:02.702
by plane and there was a lady sitting next
to Me, she was so hot.

00:58:02.903 --> 00:58:07.079
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?”
So she told Me the name.

00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.859
She said “He’s very good, this guru is
the best” … this and that.

00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:16.423
Such heat coming from her body! I never
said anything,

00:58:16.624 --> 00:58:23.267
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly
talking about her guru

00:58:23.468 --> 00:58:31.275
who is such a bad man – and without knowing
Me, I was just a stranger to her.

00:58:31.476 --> 00:58:35.468
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

00:58:35.669 --> 00:58:41.702
You should talk to your neighbors, you
should talk in your circle.

00:58:44.147 --> 00:58:51.126
Like, we have in India so many customs when
we meet people:

00:58:51.327 --> 00:58:55.312
Like in India we do haldi kumkum
in Maharashtra.

00:58:55.513 --> 00:59:00.313
They will never talk to those women who
come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:00.514 --> 00:59:04.210
They won’t even have My photograph.

00:59:04.772 --> 00:59:07.593
If they want, they can do it. But they
are -

00:59:07.794 --> 00:59:12.469
I don’t know what are they frightened
about. It’s a very good chance.

00:59:12.653 --> 00:59:18.751
You have any dinner, you have any public
meeting, anything.

00:59:18.952 --> 00:59:23.054
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga.
It’s very surprising.

00:59:23.255 --> 00:59:25.194
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:59:25.395 --> 00:59:29.649
that, “We have got this through Sahaja
Yoga.”

00:59:29.850 --> 00:59:33.376
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

00:59:33.577 --> 00:59:40.790
One has to understand you all should find
out how much responsible you have been

00:59:40.991 --> 00:59:45.962
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course,
you are all protected,

00:59:46.163 --> 00:59:55.719
you are all blessed, everyone has got
whatever they wanted. Most of them.

00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:02.265
But how many of them are returning
this debt?

01:00:02.466 --> 01:00:07.969
How many are working to give Realization
to others?

01:00:08.170 --> 01:00:17.626
This is a debt on you. But if your
attention is haphazard,

01:00:17.827 --> 01:00:26.491
if your attention is not clear, is not
nirmal,

01:00:26.692 --> 01:00:36.946
then you are involved into all kinds
of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

01:00:37.147 --> 01:00:39.679
You become like an octopus,

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:44.743
you go on getting attached to this,
attached to that, attached to that.

01:00:44.944 --> 01:00:53.194
You have to be a free bird. All these
attachments that you have

01:00:54.514 --> 01:01:01.884
are going to take you nowhere. You should
be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

01:01:02.085 --> 01:01:07.632
and should be conscious that you have known
yourself.

01:01:07.833 --> 01:01:14.579
If you can just understand your value,
your level,

01:01:14.780 --> 01:01:19.944
I can tell you – we can change the whole
world!

01:01:20.145 --> 01:01:23.716
We have such a good heritage in this
country;

01:01:23.908 --> 01:01:27.624
we have such good culture in this country.

01:01:27.825 --> 01:01:33.803
I have seen the problems of America and
other places, we don’t have these problems.

01:01:34.004 --> 01:01:38.981
At least they’re not so prevalent.

01:01:39.182 --> 01:01:44.099
But only the thing that we have to do

01:01:44.754 --> 01:01:48.694
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:01:48.895 --> 01:01:54.475
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows
it’s a tree.

01:01:54.676 --> 01:02:00.686
It knows it has to produce roots, it has
not come up ‘like that’.

01:02:00.887 --> 01:02:07.499
It has not been brought up just like
a stick, no.

01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:14.975
It has to do something. In this world
everything has to do something.

01:02:15.176 --> 01:02:19.669
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such
a rare thing to happen

01:02:19.870 --> 01:02:25.178
that you have got your Realization. So
where should we waste our attention?

01:02:25.379 --> 01:02:32.444
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why?
We have to grow, we are a different people.

01:02:32.645 --> 01:02:38.505
We are a different race altogether in this
world. We are realized souls.

01:02:38.706 --> 01:02:45.045
There were hardly any number during
the time of Christ, practically nil.

01:02:45.246 --> 01:02:51.325
And even before that I was surprised that
in China and other places,

01:02:51.526 --> 01:02:59.309
in one age there used to be one guru – one
master. While you are so many masters,

01:02:59.510 --> 01:03:04.255
but you don’t want to use your power
as a master.

01:03:04.456 --> 01:03:09.280
Why not the women use it also? I find women
are more lethargic

01:03:09.481 --> 01:03:14.121
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should
show – I am a woman Myself,

01:03:14.322 --> 01:03:18.536
single-handed I’ve done all this work;
and why shouldn’t you do it?

01:03:18.737 --> 01:03:24.749
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform
people all over the world.

01:03:24.950 --> 01:03:31.389
But it’s very easy for you – if I can
do it, why can’t you do it?

01:03:31.590 --> 01:03:40.116
But put your complete attention to it that:
‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:44.397
not for ourselves, but for the betterment
of humanity.’

01:03:44.598 --> 01:03:49.474
We need it, we need it very much.

01:03:49.675 --> 01:03:55.967
Your compassion, your love, is all being
wasted

01:03:56.168 --> 01:04:02.036
if you just think about yourself,
your family – what’s the use?

01:04:02.518 --> 01:04:06.116
People do that even before Realization.

01:04:06.317 --> 01:04:12.833
So what is the use of completely getting
attached to your families,

01:04:13.034 --> 01:04:18.888
attached to all other things? You should
get attached to the whole world!

01:04:19.089 --> 01:04:24.669
You belong to the whole world now, you are
no more individualistic.

01:04:24.870 --> 01:04:31.210
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop
has become the ocean.

01:04:31.411 --> 01:04:38.686
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is
the lowest, if you have seen,

01:04:38.887 --> 01:04:44.786
lowest so much that the zero point starts
from the ocean.

01:04:44.987 --> 01:04:51.186
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point –
it lives,

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:55.036
but all the rivers flow into it.

01:04:55.237 --> 01:05:02.280
And the ocean does the work of throwing
clouds in the sky.

01:05:02.481 --> 01:05:10.528
And these then burst and become rain
falling to the same ocean.

01:05:10.729 --> 01:05:16.893
They come back to the same ocean. So those
who are humble

01:05:17.094 --> 01:05:20.723
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:20.924 --> 01:05:25.739
Those who are kind will attract much more
Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:31.090
So it is important to see that you change
your temperament.

01:05:31.291 --> 01:05:37.081
If you try to show off, nobody is going
to be impressed by you.

01:05:39.112 --> 01:05:46.176
If you think you are something very great,
nobody is going to look at you.

01:05:46.377 --> 01:05:56.121
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very
joyous person.

01:05:56.322 --> 01:06:00.753
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group
and telling them,

01:06:00.954 --> 01:06:07.667
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying
and this thing is happening,

01:06:07.868 --> 01:06:15.653
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will
say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

01:06:15.854 --> 01:06:19.895
You go and cry and weep and sit down
there!”

01:06:20.096 --> 01:06:27.942
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no
sickness can come, no trouble can come.

01:06:28.143 --> 01:06:33.401
It is a fact. Try to understand.

01:06:33.602 --> 01:06:40.403
With you only these people who are
supposed to be there, they will rise.

01:06:40.604 --> 01:06:46.714
But no use having identification with
people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

01:06:46.915 --> 01:06:50.276
They may be your relations, they may be
anything. No use,

01:06:50.477 --> 01:06:54.073
because you are at a different level, they
are at a different level.

01:06:54.274 --> 01:06:59.590
Either try to raise their level, or have
nothing to do with them,

01:06:59.791 --> 01:07:05.246
because they will pull you down. They will
not see your height,

01:07:05.447 --> 01:07:11.581
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear
to hear,

01:07:11.782 --> 01:07:18.246
and they have no feelings of any kind.
If they have seen how you are changed,

01:07:18.447 --> 01:07:25.980
how your life is changed, they would have
gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:26.181 --> 01:07:31.825
But if they are not, that’s not your job.
You shouldn’t bother about them.

01:07:32.026 --> 01:07:36.395
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good,
otherwise they are no your relations.

01:07:36.596 --> 01:07:41.244
In no way they are related to you. How will
you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

01:07:41.445 --> 01:07:45.425
How will you explain anything to them?
It’s going to be impossible

01:07:45.626 --> 01:07:48.463
to talk to these people.

01:07:50.494 --> 01:07:55.356
So what I have to tell you today is that
our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

01:07:55.557 --> 01:08:02.465
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and
it’s doing very well.

01:08:02.666 --> 01:08:07.339
But what we have to see – that you do
belong to that ocean,

01:08:07.540 --> 01:08:11.684
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:11.885 --> 01:08:17.963
But it is for you to increase the size
of this.

01:08:18.174 --> 01:08:23.942
You have to increase, you have to talk
about it, and you have to change people.

01:08:24.143 --> 01:08:33.246
This is your responsibility. You were not
given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

01:08:33.447 --> 01:08:39.637
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis,
better Sahaja Yogis;

01:08:39.838 --> 01:08:44.823
and you yourself meditate, not only
meditate

01:08:45.024 --> 01:08:50.903
but also attend all the collective programs
as far as possible.

01:08:51.104 --> 01:08:56.385
I am happy the way you have stayed on and
have come here.

01:08:56.586 --> 01:09:05.371
It has rained – still you are here and you
still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

01:09:05.572 --> 01:09:11.448
I again and again bless you from my heart,
and I want you to have

01:09:11.649 --> 01:09:16.762
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

01:09:16.963 --> 01:09:25.004
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is
the pure desire,

01:09:25.205 --> 01:09:31.356
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but
to create more Sahaja Yogis.

01:09:31.557 --> 01:09:37.455
That is actually your pure desire. You may
not have recognized it,

01:09:37.656 --> 01:09:43.465
but unless and until you fulfill that
desire,

01:09:43.666 --> 01:09:48.252
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi.
It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

01:09:48.453 --> 01:09:56.143
in every level, in everywhere, with every
one – that you can do it.

01:09:56.344 --> 01:10:01.653
And it will spread very well, and so many
people can be saved.

01:10:01.854 --> 01:10:08.012
So many people who are just lost
in the maya of stupidity

01:10:08.213 --> 01:10:11.112
will be back on the right path.

01:10:11.313 --> 01:10:15.887
How much good you are going to do for them
you just think.

01:10:16.088 --> 01:10:20.369
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja
Yogis,

01:10:20.572 --> 01:10:27.840
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja
Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:28.041 --> 01:10:31.731
The whole problem – whenever I see
newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

01:10:31.932 --> 01:10:35.887
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there
would have been no problem’.

01:10:36.088 --> 01:10:41.885
But I find that still people are roaming
about, and going round and round,

01:10:42.086 --> 01:10:47.690
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or
they’ve no understanding

01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:53.970
that ‘where is this world going?’ and
‘Who’s going to save this world?’

01:10:54.854 --> 01:11:00.979
I am not here to tell you what you should
do in your private life.

01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:05.297
But you yourself should know to keep
yourself cleansed

01:11:05.498 --> 01:11:09.016
and beautiful, what you have to do
to yourself.

01:11:09.217 --> 01:11:13.674
Some people are so superficial that it
doesn’t go into their heads.

01:11:13.875 --> 01:11:17.268
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their
heads – very, very superficial.

01:11:17.469 --> 01:11:22.580
So forget them. I don’t think they can
be saved. So forget them,

01:11:22.781 --> 01:11:27.153
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about
some nonsensical things always.

01:11:27.354 --> 01:11:32.338
So with such people you need not – but
there are still so many people,

01:11:32.539 --> 01:11:39.738
at least I think 80% people, who are
seeking and you should give them help.

01:11:39.939 --> 01:11:43.349
This is one thing, is the desire of your
Mother

01:11:43.550 --> 01:11:47.296
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga
upon yourself

01:11:47.497 --> 01:11:51.380
and go on telling about this to everyone
who comes.

01:11:51.581 --> 01:12:00.541
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I
do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.
