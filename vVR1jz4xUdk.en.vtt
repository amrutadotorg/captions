00:37:05.248 --> 00:37:12.261
Now, we are starting a New Year,

00:37:12.462 --> 00:37:20.124
and I wish you all a very happy and prosperous New Year.

00:37:27.684 --> 00:37:40.171
In this wish of Mine I also wish you a very deep growth in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:48.106 --> 00:37:58.577
Now you all are Sahaja Yogis and you all have to become masters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:58.793 --> 00:38:10.422
For becoming masters in Sahaja Yoga I am sure you are doing meditation, introspection

00:38:11.786 --> 00:38:18.144
and all kinds of Sahaja Yoga rituals, I should say.

00:38:22.886 --> 00:38:33.248
In this New Year, I’ll think there is greater chance

00:38:35.013 --> 00:38:39.185
for you to do much better,

00:38:39.903 --> 00:38:47.692
because all those years of ordeals are over.

00:38:52.778 --> 00:39:02.561
We are now entering into the New Era. I say now the Satya Yuga is established.

00:39:07.787 --> 00:39:14.602
In the beginning you may not feel the atmosphere

00:39:15.342 --> 00:39:20.743
of Kali Yuga being cleared out completely.

00:39:20.944 --> 00:39:27.897
Of course, gradually you’ll find that’s all clearing out

00:39:28.098 --> 00:39:35.883
and all the people who are dangerous for your spiritual life,

00:39:36.084 --> 00:39:46.531
for your national life, for your family life, will have to take back their way;

00:39:46.732 --> 00:39:50.289
they cannot be successful here.

00:39:57.897 --> 00:40:05.258
Now the Sahaja Yogis have to decide how far they will spread Sahaja Yoga all over.

00:40:05.459 --> 00:40:09.710
How many people can get into Sahaja Yoga?

00:40:09.911 --> 00:40:16.430
There should be many more waiting for you this year,

00:40:16.631 --> 00:40:23.430
and maybe this year, if you all decide to work it out, I am sure

00:40:23.631 --> 00:40:31.796
you can get lots of people who will be saved from the curses of Kali Yuga.

00:40:31.997 --> 00:40:39.922
This is going to be your vow on the New Year day,

00:40:40.125 --> 00:40:47.274
that now we are going to start Sahaja Yoga in a new way,

00:40:47.475 --> 00:40:51.647
in a bigger way, in a more dynamic way.

00:40:51.848 --> 00:40:59.751
For that, first thing is needed is your Sangha Shakti, that is your collectivity.

00:40:59.952 --> 00:41:07.071
This collectivity has to be extremely well built-in, well made,

00:41:07.272 --> 00:41:12.803
well understood and absolutely loveable.

00:41:13.772 --> 00:41:20.383
This is not difficult in Sahaja Yoga, because practically all your jealousies,

00:41:20.584 --> 00:41:30.115
all your baser ideas have been completely washed out by your Kundalini.

00:41:30.316 --> 00:41:37.055
She has transformed you, you are different people; you are very, very different.

00:41:37.256 --> 00:41:45.843
Not only that, but you have now understood yourselves.

00:41:46.044 --> 00:41:51.883
You are knowing your Self. And all those who know their self

00:41:52.084 --> 00:41:55.572
cannot fight with each other.

00:41:56.733 --> 00:42:04.733
Because this Self is the reflection of one person,

00:42:04.934 --> 00:42:12.968
of one Deity, of one God. And so how can you fight?

00:42:13.169 --> 00:42:20.733
When He is within your heart, how can you fight with each other?

00:42:20.934 --> 00:42:24.711
When He, otherwise you’ll be fighting with yourself.

00:42:24.912 --> 00:42:29.305
It would be very, very stupid to do that.

00:42:29.506 --> 00:42:37.764
So all the fights and all the funny things that you have been thinking about

00:42:38.264 --> 00:42:43.850
will of course disappear, no doubt. But you’ll become very dynamic.

00:42:44.051 --> 00:42:48.288
You’ll be amazed at your dynamism. Just you have to rise;

00:42:48.489 --> 00:42:54.358
just you have to expect your Self to manifest.

00:42:54.559 --> 00:43:01.157
You can become very, very collective, progressive

00:43:01.358 --> 00:43:05.787
and you can create many Sahaja Yogis.

00:43:05.988 --> 00:43:14.649
You have been given Realization; you have been given the knowledge of Realization;

00:43:14.850 --> 00:43:22.594
whatever was possible has been done for your health and prosperity,

00:43:22.795 --> 00:43:32.186
but now it’s your duty to repay to the Divine by your creative methods.

00:43:32.387 --> 00:43:35.772
You have to be very creative.

00:43:35.973 --> 00:43:44.039
You'll find so many people in this world are full of lots of problems,

00:43:44.240 --> 00:43:50.671
which you have got out of it. But you can help them.

00:43:50.872 --> 00:43:55.670
You don’t need any help because you are yourself full of power –

00:43:55.871 --> 00:44:02.798
power of Divinity within you. This Divine power should be used.

00:44:02.999 --> 00:44:08.712
It’s not given just to be rusted. This power has to be used.

00:44:08.912 --> 00:44:12.963
Otherwise what’s the use of becoming powerful?

00:44:13.164 --> 00:44:17.995
Supposing we have electrical power here, and it doesn’t even give light,

00:44:18.196 --> 00:44:21.815
so what’s the use of having electrical power?

00:44:22.016 --> 00:44:27.908
So the power that you have is for the emancipation of human beings.

00:44:30.365 --> 00:44:38.112
It is for you to raise the Kundalini of people – you can do it.

00:44:38.313 --> 00:44:41.299
One person can do it for thousands!

00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:47.800
And I hope now you take up this responsibility upon yourself.

00:44:48.001 --> 00:44:53.856
This would be the greatest blessing for you, for Sahaja Yoga

00:44:54.057 --> 00:45:01.809
and for the whole world. Because in My vision, we have to change the whole world.

00:45:02.010 --> 00:45:05.754
I don’t know in My lifetime if I can achieve it or not.

00:45:05.955 --> 00:45:09.542
But if you people really join hands with Me,

00:45:09.743 --> 00:45:15.356
with full effort, it will work out.

00:45:15.557 --> 00:45:24.848
Firstly I hear many people don’t go to meditation, into collective meditation.

00:45:25.049 --> 00:45:32.778
They do not join together. It’s surprising after so many years of work I’ve done –

00:45:32.979 --> 00:45:38.536
thirty years I’ve been working, and there are some, some people

00:45:38.737 --> 00:45:45.495
who take Sahaja Yoga for granted. You don’t understand your responsibility.

00:45:45.696 --> 00:45:49.973
You have to meditate collectively.

00:45:50.174 --> 00:45:55.096
Whenever there is collective meditation you must join that.

00:45:55.297 --> 00:46:03.510
You can also start something in your areas, a collective meditation.

00:46:03.711 --> 00:46:09.760
And it will work out. Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga

00:46:09.961 --> 00:46:13.596
are now meditating, I can make them out.

00:46:13.797 --> 00:46:17.995
I know who are the ones who are meditating and who are not.

00:46:18.196 --> 00:46:21.856
It’s not difficult to make it out. And then you come out

00:46:22.057 --> 00:46:27.411
with other problems like my mother’s, father’s, uncle’s – this thing.

00:46:27.612 --> 00:46:33.598
There’s no need to worry about that. Even if you are a realized soul,

00:46:33.799 --> 00:46:40.815
and when you are connected with the Divine, even your own wish will be fulfilled.

00:46:41.016 --> 00:46:49.098
But it does not. Why? Because you still do not understand what you have become.

00:46:49.299 --> 00:46:55.643
You first try giving Realizations to others. See what joy you feel.

00:46:55.844 --> 00:47:01.114
Tremendous joy. This joy you cannot get in anything else.

00:47:01.315 --> 00:47:06.002
Whatever you may buy, whatever you may have,

00:47:06.203 --> 00:47:10.582
you cannot get this joy of giving Realization.

00:47:10.783 --> 00:47:16.254
And you will be so very happy; not because you expect anything,

00:47:16.455 --> 00:47:23.059
you want anything, nothing of the kind – but only thing is pure joy –

00:47:23.260 --> 00:47:30.831
pure joy of creating great Sahaja Yogis. This is what you are there.

00:47:31.032 --> 00:47:40.036
This is what the Divine wants you to do. Not just to take advantage of Divine power:

00:47:40.237 --> 00:47:45.098
“Cure my father, cure my mother, cure my sister… ”

00:47:45.299 --> 00:47:49.629
or else, “I haven’t got properties…” Then somebody says,

00:47:49.830 --> 00:47:56.379
“My husband ill-treats me…” or some wife says that… so the husband says this...

00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:59.800
It’s going on and on and on. Forget it!

00:48:00.001 --> 00:48:03.746
You are now above everything, above all these things.

00:48:03.947 --> 00:48:09.176
And you have become absolutely powerful, believe Me.

00:48:09.377 --> 00:48:14.784
If you haven’t used your power, then how will you know what powers you have got?

00:48:14.985 --> 00:48:19.661
It’s as simple as that. Those who have used it

00:48:19.862 --> 00:48:24.778
go on telling Me what miracles they had, what things have happened to them,

00:48:24.979 --> 00:48:30.846
how they were protected, whatever they wanted – how they got it.

00:48:31.237 --> 00:48:37.942
But see, in Sahaja Yoga you cannot be hypocritical. If you have hypocrisy,

00:48:38.143 --> 00:48:41.331
Sahaja Yoga knows, the Divine knows you are a hypocritical.

00:48:41.532 --> 00:48:46.723
It is for your good, for your growth you have to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:48:46.924 --> 00:48:51.098
It’s not for somebody else that you are doing it, but for yourself.

00:48:51.299 --> 00:48:58.575
When people are that powerful I am amazed, how they easily they can get cured.

00:48:58.776 --> 00:49:03.628
But they must meditate, and they must join collective meditation.

00:49:03.829 --> 00:49:08.307
Most of the people don’t join collective meditation. I am surprised.

00:49:08.508 --> 00:49:13.696
I know, sometimes, say in Delhi, there is no sufficient space,

00:49:13.897 --> 00:49:18.744
so people have to come twice, either Saturday or Sunday;

00:49:18.945 --> 00:49:22.146
some of them have to wait outside – doesn’t matter.

00:49:23.164 --> 00:49:26.510
But going for the collective meditation,

00:49:26.711 --> 00:49:32.908
you’ll be amazed that Divinity is flowing there. Vibrations are flowing there.

00:49:33.109 --> 00:49:40.477
I am there. It’s not that you are just going there just as a ritual.

00:49:40.711 --> 00:49:48.672
Problem is you people don’t realize that you have to be responsible for Sahaja Yoga,

00:49:48.873 --> 00:49:55.885
responsible for giving Realizations to others and attend

00:49:56.086 --> 00:50:03.235
all the programs you have of meditation.

00:50:03.436 --> 00:50:07.776
With collective meditation you get all right.

00:50:07.977 --> 00:50:14.350
All your problems are solved if you go to the collective meditation regularly –

00:50:14.551 --> 00:50:20.987
I promise you! But the problem is you won’t go; you will write letters to Me,

00:50:21.188 --> 00:50:26.321
you want to meet Me. This is not going to help.

00:50:26.522 --> 00:50:31.565
You may come and trouble Me like that, or do something like that, but doesn’t help.

00:50:31.766 --> 00:50:41.508
What helps that you help yourself. Next year is going to be a great year for you.

00:50:42.563 --> 00:50:48.570
In the West now I was surprised how things are spreading fast.

00:50:48.852 --> 00:50:58.196
In Russia the people are so deep – so deep.

00:50:58.397 --> 00:51:05.540
Once they get Realization, they understand the value of Realization.

00:51:05.741 --> 00:51:11.322
They are so humble, and so deep, they don’t want anything.

00:51:11.523 --> 00:51:16.869
They’ve never desired for anything. Though they have gone through horrible

00:51:17.070 --> 00:51:24.118
problems of communism, and now this reaction to that.

00:51:24.319 --> 00:51:33.205
Despite that, all these five countries which I call as ‘real’

00:51:33.406 --> 00:51:40.492
Divine countries, because the way they have accepted it.

00:51:41.102 --> 00:51:44.844
They are poor according to the modern standards,

00:51:45.045 --> 00:51:49.820
but from their heart they are very, very rich.

00:51:50.094 --> 00:51:56.336
From their understanding of Sahaja Yoga, they are very, very rich.

00:51:56.537 --> 00:52:02.868
And their scientists are so well qualified. In every type of thing now,

00:52:03.069 --> 00:52:10.322
there is one scientist who has come to India and who has discovered a method

00:52:10.523 --> 00:52:15.666
by which you can see all the chakras, and the Kundalini

00:52:15.867 --> 00:52:21.752
and the obstructions and everything – something he can show you.

00:52:21.953 --> 00:52:29.768
While our scientists are busy opposing Me. Little knowledge is very dangerous.

00:52:29.969 --> 00:52:33.696
They don’t want to see what I am doing and how I am doing it.

00:52:33.897 --> 00:52:39.994
They just want to criticize Me – all so-called intellectuals.

00:52:40.195 --> 00:52:42.368
Especially in Maharashtra,

00:52:42.569 --> 00:52:46.830
the intellectuals – I think they are something has gone wrong with their heads.

00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:52.651
They cannot understand Sahaja Yoga. Just beyond them.

00:52:52.852 --> 00:52:59.049
What has happened to them I don’t know, but they just can’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:59.250 --> 00:53:04.651
And these Maharashtrians are so busy with their rituals.

00:53:04.852 --> 00:53:08.657
Four o’clock in the morning they’ll get up, take their baths, do this,

00:53:08.858 --> 00:53:13.776
then start doing their Pujas, this, that.

00:53:13.977 --> 00:53:18.415
Now somebody got sick, so his wife writes to Me,

00:53:18.616 --> 00:53:21.977
“We didn’t go to any temple, we didn’t do any rituals,

00:53:22.178 --> 00:53:25.212
still my husband has got sick.” Imagine.

00:53:25.413 --> 00:53:29.963
As if doing by that you mean you are a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:53:30.164 --> 00:53:34.494
If you are a real Sahaja Yogi, then nothing can happen to you.

00:53:34.695 --> 00:53:38.588
But you have been just under wrong impression.

00:53:38.789 --> 00:53:44.019
Whether you go to temple, or whether you go to wrong places

00:53:44.220 --> 00:53:51.363
and do all kinds of rituals – it has never helped anyone.

00:53:51.564 --> 00:53:57.972
So first you have to empty yourself. If you are already filled with these ideas,

00:53:58.173 --> 00:54:03.509
these age old ideas, and you are still carrying on with them,

00:54:03.710 --> 00:54:05.894
how can the Divine be filled?

00:54:06.095 --> 00:54:12.363
If there’s a pot already full of water or anything – you cannot fill it.

00:54:12.564 --> 00:54:20.314
So you have to empty it completely. Empty yourself, empty your mind.

00:54:20.515 --> 00:54:28.902
It’s possible through Sahaja Yoga if you can take your Kundalini beyond Agnya chakra.

00:54:29.103 --> 00:54:34.488
By not reacting! Reaction is the worst thing,

00:54:34.689 --> 00:54:40.511
because reaction comes through your Agnya, as I told you the other day,

00:54:40.712 --> 00:54:49.306
and it is due to your conditioning or due to your ego.

00:54:49.507 --> 00:54:54.363
So some people react because of their conditioning,

00:54:54.564 --> 00:55:03.691
and some people react because of their ego. So why should you react to anything?

00:55:03.892 --> 00:55:08.597
Why don’t you enjoy – by not reacting. You just watch.

00:55:08.798 --> 00:55:15.831
See how beautifully they have made beautiful flowers – just enjoy it.

00:55:16.032 --> 00:55:20.292
What is the need – some will find some faults, somebody will say

00:55:20.493 --> 00:55:23.431
this should not have been there, how did they manage this,

00:55:23.632 --> 00:55:31.034
all kinds of nonsensical things. The joy of its creation is there.

00:55:31.235 --> 00:55:36.620
And you should be able to see it, feel it, enjoy it.

00:55:36.821 --> 00:55:41.899
Then you are a Sahaja Yogi. Otherwise you are not.

00:55:42.100 --> 00:55:47.994
If you are a reacting type, you cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:55:48.195 --> 00:55:52.502
This is a degree – Sahaja Yoga is –

00:55:52.703 --> 00:55:58.790
I think there are so many various styles of Sahaja Yogis.

00:55:59.118 --> 00:56:06.105
Somebody is just minor, somebody a little plus, somebody’s like that.

00:56:06.306 --> 00:56:12.017
But the depth of the Sahaja Yogi is

00:56:12.218 --> 00:56:17.902
to be measured by the way he keeps joyous and happy.

00:56:18.103 --> 00:56:23.105
Goes on criticizing others, go on getting angry with others,

00:56:23.306 --> 00:56:28.157
all these things are going on, and he thinks he’s a Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:28.368 --> 00:56:35.948
In our Divine University we have no degrees, we don’t give you certificates,

00:56:36.150 --> 00:56:39.073
you are a Sahaja Yogi, if you have got your Realization.

00:56:39.274 --> 00:56:45.040
If the Kundalini has burst opened here – it’s all right, you are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:45.241 --> 00:56:51.773
But that Sahaja Yogi may not be a real Sahaja Yogi.

00:56:51.974 --> 00:56:58.571
It only depends when you are joyous and you are anxious

00:56:58.772 --> 00:57:04.400
to give Realizations to others. You want to share your Realization,

00:57:04.601 --> 00:57:11.071
you just don’t want to keep it to yourself. If that is not your condition,

00:57:11.272 --> 00:57:15.257
then you are still not a full Sahaja Yogi.

00:57:15.458 --> 00:57:19.483
You should find out how many people you have given Realization.

00:57:19.684 --> 00:57:25.712
It’s very important. Because next year, as I’ve said, is a very important,

00:57:25.913 --> 00:57:31.242
very, very important year.

00:57:31.443 --> 00:57:41.736
In that year I would like to see all of you going round and giving Realization.

00:57:41.937 --> 00:57:48.933
While I’ve seen all these other false gurus who are getting exposed one by one.

00:57:49.793 --> 00:57:57.845
If you see their attitude, anywhere you meet them – once I was travelling

00:57:58.046 --> 00:58:02.280
by plane and there was a lady sitting next to Me, she was so hot.

00:58:02.481 --> 00:58:06.657
So I asked her, “What guru do you follow?” So she told Me the name.

00:58:06.858 --> 00:58:11.437
She said “He’s very good, this guru is the best” … this and that.

00:58:11.638 --> 00:58:16.001
Such heat coming from her body! I never said anything,

00:58:16.202 --> 00:58:22.845
but I was amazed how this lady was proudly talking about her guru

00:58:23.046 --> 00:58:30.853
who is such a bad man – and without knowing Me, I was just a stranger to her.

00:58:31.054 --> 00:58:35.046
But Sahaja Yogis don’t talk about it.

00:58:35.247 --> 00:58:41.280
You should talk to your neighbors, you should talk in your circle.

00:58:43.725 --> 00:58:50.704
Like, we have in India so many customs when we meet people:

00:58:50.905 --> 00:58:54.890
Like in India we do haldi kumkum in Maharashtra.

00:58:55.091 --> 00:58:59.891
They will never talk to those women who come for haldi kumkum about Sahaja Yoga.

00:59:00.092 --> 00:59:03.788
They won’t even have My photograph.

00:59:04.350 --> 00:59:07.171
If they want, they can do it. But they are -

00:59:07.372 --> 00:59:12.047
I don’t know what are they frightened about. It’s a very good chance.

00:59:12.231 --> 00:59:18.329
You have any dinner, you have any public meeting, anything.

00:59:18.530 --> 00:59:22.632
They won’t talk about Sahaja Yoga. It’s very surprising.

00:59:22.833 --> 00:59:24.772
They don’t want to talk about Sahaja Yoga

00:59:24.973 --> 00:59:29.227
that, “We have got this through Sahaja Yoga.”

00:59:29.428 --> 00:59:32.954
So how will Sahaja Yoga spread?

00:59:33.155 --> 00:59:40.368
One has to understand you all should find out how much responsible you have been

00:59:40.569 --> 00:59:45.540
for getting into Sahaja Yoga. Of course, you are all protected,

00:59:45.741 --> 00:59:55.297
you are all blessed, everyone has got whatever they wanted. Most of them.

00:59:55.498 --> 01:00:01.843
But how many of them are returning this debt?

01:00:02.044 --> 01:00:07.547
How many are working to give Realization to others?

01:00:07.748 --> 01:00:17.204
This is a debt on you. But if your attention is haphazard,

01:00:17.405 --> 01:00:26.069
if your attention is not clear, is not nirmal,

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:36.524
then you are involved into all kinds of things like the tentacles of an octopus.

01:00:36.725 --> 01:00:39.257
You become like an octopus,

01:00:39.458 --> 01:00:44.321
you go on getting attached to this, attached to that, attached to that.

01:00:44.522 --> 01:00:52.772
You have to be a free bird. All these attachments that you have

01:00:54.092 --> 01:01:01.462
are going to take you nowhere. You should be only attached to Sahaja Yoga

01:01:01.663 --> 01:01:07.210
and should be conscious that you have known yourself.

01:01:07.411 --> 01:01:14.157
If you can just understand your value, your level,

01:01:14.358 --> 01:01:19.522
I can tell you – we can change the whole world!

01:01:19.723 --> 01:01:23.294
We have such a good heritage in this country;

01:01:23.486 --> 01:01:27.202
we have such good culture in this country.

01:01:27.403 --> 01:01:33.381
I have seen the problems of America and other places, we don’t have these problems.

01:01:33.582 --> 01:01:38.559
At least they’re not so prevalent.

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:43.677
But only the thing that we have to do

01:01:44.332 --> 01:01:48.272
is to know you are a Sahaja Yogi.

01:01:48.473 --> 01:01:54.053
Like a tree – when it grows, it knows it’s a tree.

01:01:54.254 --> 01:02:00.264
It knows it has to produce roots, it has not come up ‘like that’.

01:02:00.465 --> 01:02:07.077
It has not been brought up just like a stick, no.

01:02:07.278 --> 01:02:14.553
It has to do something. In this world everything has to do something.

01:02:14.754 --> 01:02:19.247
But then what about Sahaja Yogis? It’s such a rare thing to happen

01:02:19.448 --> 01:02:24.756
that you have got your Realization. So where should we waste our attention?

01:02:24.957 --> 01:02:32.022
Why should we neglect our meditation? Why? We have to grow, we are a different people.

01:02:32.223 --> 01:02:38.083
We are a different race altogether in this world. We are realized souls.

01:02:38.284 --> 01:02:44.623
There were hardly any number during the time of Christ, practically nil.

01:02:44.824 --> 01:02:50.903
And even before that I was surprised that in China and other places,

01:02:51.104 --> 01:02:58.887
in one age there used to be one guru – one master. While you are so many masters,

01:02:59.088 --> 01:03:03.833
but you don’t want to use your power as a master.

01:03:04.034 --> 01:03:08.858
Why not the women use it also? I find women are more lethargic

01:03:09.059 --> 01:03:13.699
than men are in Sahaja Yoga. They should show – I am a woman Myself,

01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:18.114
single-handed I’ve done all this work; and why shouldn’t you do it?

01:03:18.315 --> 01:03:24.327
Because it’s a tremendous task to transform people all over the world.

01:03:24.528 --> 01:03:30.967
But it’s very easy for you – if I can do it, why can’t you do it?

01:03:31.168 --> 01:03:39.694
But put your complete attention to it that: ‘We are going to work out Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:39.895 --> 01:03:43.975
not for ourselves, but for the betterment of humanity.’

01:03:44.176 --> 01:03:49.052
We need it, we need it very much.

01:03:49.253 --> 01:03:55.545
Your compassion, your love, is all being wasted

01:03:55.746 --> 01:04:01.614
if you just think about yourself, your family – what’s the use?

01:04:02.096 --> 01:04:05.694
People do that even before Realization.

01:04:05.895 --> 01:04:12.411
So what is the use of completely getting attached to your families,

01:04:12.612 --> 01:04:18.466
attached to all other things? You should get attached to the whole world!

01:04:18.667 --> 01:04:24.247
You belong to the whole world now, you are no more individualistic.

01:04:24.448 --> 01:04:30.788
No more! Now, as I said, it’s a drop has become the ocean.

01:04:30.989 --> 01:04:38.264
Identify yourself with the ocean. Ocean is the lowest, if you have seen,

01:04:38.465 --> 01:04:44.364
lowest so much that the zero point starts from the ocean.

01:04:44.565 --> 01:04:50.764
Ocean is so humble. It’s the lowest point – it lives,

01:04:50.965 --> 01:04:54.614
but all the rivers flow into it.

01:04:54.815 --> 01:05:01.858
And the ocean does the work of throwing clouds in the sky.

01:05:02.059 --> 01:05:10.106
And these then burst and become rain falling to the same ocean.

01:05:10.307 --> 01:05:16.471
They come back to the same ocean. So those who are humble

01:05:16.672 --> 01:05:20.301
will attract more Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:20.502 --> 01:05:25.317
Those who are kind will attract much more Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:25.518 --> 01:05:30.668
So it is important to see that you change your temperament.

01:05:30.869 --> 01:05:36.659
If you try to show off, nobody is going to be impressed by you.

01:05:38.690 --> 01:05:45.754
If you think you are something very great, nobody is going to look at you.

01:05:45.955 --> 01:05:55.699
Be very humble, kind, generous – also very joyous person.

01:05:55.900 --> 01:06:00.331
Now imagine a Sahaja Yogi going in a group and telling them,

01:06:00.532 --> 01:06:07.245
“See, my mother is sick, my father is dying and this thing is happening,

01:06:07.446 --> 01:06:15.231
but I am doing Sahaja Yoga.” So people will say, “Why do you do Sahaja Yoga then?

01:06:15.432 --> 01:06:19.473
You go and cry and weep and sit down there!”

01:06:19.674 --> 01:06:27.520
If he’s really doing the Sahaja Yoga, no sickness can come, no trouble can come.

01:06:27.721 --> 01:06:32.979
It is a fact. Try to understand.

01:06:33.180 --> 01:06:39.981
With you only these people who are supposed to be there, they will rise.

01:06:40.182 --> 01:06:46.292
But no use having identification with people who are not Sahaja Yogis.

01:06:46.493 --> 01:06:49.854
They may be your relations, they may be anything. No use,

01:06:50.055 --> 01:06:53.651
because you are at a different level, they are at a different level.

01:06:53.852 --> 01:06:59.168
Either try to raise their level, or have nothing to do with them,

01:06:59.369 --> 01:07:04.824
because they will pull you down. They will not see your height,

01:07:05.025 --> 01:07:11.159
they have no eyes to see, they have no ear to hear,

01:07:11.360 --> 01:07:17.824
and they have no feelings of any kind. If they have seen how you are changed,

01:07:18.025 --> 01:07:25.558
how your life is changed, they would have gone absolutely head-long into Sahaja Yoga.

01:07:25.759 --> 01:07:31.403
But if they are not, that’s not your job. You shouldn’t bother about them.

01:07:31.604 --> 01:07:35.973
If they come to Sahaja Yoga, well and good, otherwise they are no your relations.

01:07:36.174 --> 01:07:40.822
In no way they are related to you. How will you relate Sahaja Yoga to them?

01:07:41.023 --> 01:07:45.003
How will you explain anything to them? It’s going to be impossible

01:07:45.204 --> 01:07:48.041
to talk to these people.

01:07:50.072 --> 01:07:54.934
So what I have to tell you today is that our family which is Sahaja Yoga,

01:07:55.135 --> 01:08:02.043
is large, it’s spread in 86 countries, and it’s doing very well.

01:08:02.244 --> 01:08:06.917
But what we have to see – that you do belong to that ocean,

01:08:07.118 --> 01:08:11.262
to the great families of Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:11.463 --> 01:08:17.541
But it is for you to increase the size of this.

01:08:17.752 --> 01:08:23.520
You have to increase, you have to talk about it, and you have to change people.

01:08:23.721 --> 01:08:32.824
This is your responsibility. You were not given Sahaja Yoga just for nothing,

01:08:33.025 --> 01:08:39.215
you have to produce greater Sahaja Yogis, better Sahaja Yogis;

01:08:39.416 --> 01:08:44.401
and you yourself meditate, not only meditate

01:08:44.602 --> 01:08:50.481
but also attend all the collective programs as far as possible.

01:08:50.682 --> 01:08:55.963
I am happy the way you have stayed on and have come here.

01:08:56.164 --> 01:09:04.949
It has rained – still you are here and you still are enjoying the Divine bliss.

01:09:05.150 --> 01:09:11.026
I again and again bless you from my heart, and I want you to have

01:09:11.227 --> 01:09:16.340
that Shuddha Iccha which is the Kundalini,

01:09:16.541 --> 01:09:24.582
want you to have that Shuddha Iccha that is the pure desire,

01:09:24.783 --> 01:09:30.934
not only to become Sahaja Yogis but to create more Sahaja Yogis.

01:09:31.135 --> 01:09:37.033
That is actually your pure desire. You may not have recognized it,

01:09:37.234 --> 01:09:43.043
but unless and until you fulfill that desire,

01:09:43.244 --> 01:09:47.830
you can never be a good Sahaja Yogi. It’s to spread Sahaja Yoga

01:09:48.031 --> 01:09:55.721
in every venue, in everywhere, in every one – that you can do it.

01:09:55.922 --> 01:10:01.231
And it will spread very well, and so many people can be saved.

01:10:01.432 --> 01:10:07.590
So many people who are just lost in the maya of stupidity

01:10:07.791 --> 01:10:10.690
will be back on the right path.

01:10:10.891 --> 01:10:15.465
How much good you are going to do for them you just think.

01:10:15.666 --> 01:10:19.947
If Me alone has brought so many Sahaja Yogis,

01:10:20.150 --> 01:10:27.418
why can’t you also try and get more Sahaja Yogis? This world needs Sahaja Yoga.

01:10:27.619 --> 01:10:31.309
The whole problem – whenever I see newspaper, I think, ‘Oh God,

01:10:31.510 --> 01:10:35.465
if these people were Sahaja Yogis, there would have been no problem’.

01:10:35.666 --> 01:10:41.463
But I find that still people are roaming about, and going round and round,

01:10:41.664 --> 01:10:47.268
I don’t know, as if they have no brains or they’ve no understanding

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:53.548
that ‘where is this world going?’ and ‘Who’s going to save this world?’

01:10:54.332 --> 01:11:00.557
I am not here to tell you what you should do in your private life.

01:11:00.758 --> 01:11:04.875
But you yourself should know to keep yourself cleansed

01:11:05.076 --> 01:11:08.594
and beautiful, what you have to do to yourself.

01:11:08.795 --> 01:11:13.252
Some people are so superficial that it doesn’t go into their heads.

01:11:13.453 --> 01:11:16.846
Sahaja Yoga just doesn’t go into their heads – very, very superficial.

01:11:17.047 --> 01:11:22.158
So forget them. I don’t think they can be saved. So forget them,

01:11:22.359 --> 01:11:26.731
they cannot enjoy. They are worried about some nonsensical things always.

01:11:26.932 --> 01:11:31.916
So with such people you need not – but there are still so many people,

01:11:32.117 --> 01:11:39.316
at least I think 80% people, who are seeking and you should give them help.

01:11:39.517 --> 01:11:42.927
This is one thing, is the desire of your Mother

01:11:43.128 --> 01:11:46.874
that you should now take up Sahaja Yoga upon yourself

01:11:47.075 --> 01:11:50.958
and go on telling about this to everyone who comes.

01:11:51.159 --> 01:12:00.119
I mean I don’t want cheap popularity, but I do want Sahaja Yogis to be made everywhere.

01:12:00.753 --> 01:12:03.989
Now I am going to speak in Marathi.

01:12:04.190 --> 01:12:08.733
At our place, especially the women,

01:12:08.934 --> 01:12:12.305
they know all the festivals by heart.

01:12:12.736 --> 01:12:16.729
Everything is going on properly as per the festival,

01:12:16.930 --> 01:12:20.416
by getting up at 4 AM in the morning, have bath,

01:12:20.617 --> 01:12:23.624
filling up the old style copper water heater, then sitting down.

01:12:23.824 --> 01:12:26.202
Sitting for what? For Puja.

01:12:26.403 --> 01:12:30.671
And we, the people of Maharashtra are very ritualistic.

01:12:30.872 --> 01:12:33.464
In Delhi, it is better.

01:12:33.665 --> 01:12:36.171
There people are not so ritualistic.

01:12:36.372 --> 01:12:38.734
Hence lakhs of people have taken realization.

01:12:38.935 --> 01:12:42.012
But in Maharashtra it is not possible.

01:12:42.213 --> 01:12:47.392
They have to go to Pandharpur taking all sorts of trouble.

01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:52.941
And once you go to Pandhari then you cannot achieve Self Realization there.

01:12:53.626 --> 01:12:55.498
Actually one should get Realization.

01:12:55.699 --> 01:13:00.187
But, all those who go to Pandhari do not achieve Self Realization.

01:13:00.388 --> 01:13:03.027
On the contrary, they keep arguing against.

01:13:03.228 --> 01:13:08.651
Otherwise they proceed holding a big pot of basil on their head.

01:13:09.131 --> 01:13:11.724
Where are they going? To Alandi.

01:13:11.925 --> 01:13:15.004
What for? And who told you?

01:13:19.267 --> 01:13:22.234
Did Dnyaneshwara tell you?

01:13:22.727 --> 01:13:25.892
He did not have footwear on his feet,

01:13:26.093 --> 01:13:29.083
and these people take out his procession in a palanquin.

01:13:29.283 --> 01:13:31.385
They carry out the procession in a palanquin

01:13:31.584 --> 01:13:33.789
and eat food in every village.

01:13:33.990 --> 01:13:37.122
Means there is no self respect.

01:13:37.322 --> 01:13:40.377
In the name of Dnyaneshwar they go to every village

01:13:40.578 --> 01:13:43.148
and keep on consuming food.

01:13:43.673 --> 01:13:47.218
And the villagers think that they achieved punyas by this.

01:13:47.419 --> 01:13:49.771
But these people are beggars.

01:13:49.972 --> 01:13:51.669
They are beggars.

01:13:51.870 --> 01:13:54.576
They move around asking for alms on Dnyanadeva’s name.

01:13:54.777 --> 01:13:57.382
Why do you want to fill bellies of such people?

01:13:57.583 --> 01:14:02.059
What benefit are you going to get by feeding such beggars?

01:14:03.584 --> 01:14:07.865
In our Maharashtra, many such ill practices are continuing

01:14:08.066 --> 01:14:09.534
and there is no end to it.

01:14:09.735 --> 01:14:13.726
If you go on the road, you see them somewhere or the other.

01:14:13.927 --> 01:14:16.186
So all this should stop.

01:14:16.387 --> 01:14:20.165
You tell yourself and tell the others, "What nonsense is this?".

01:14:20.366 --> 01:14:24.777
Why do you do these things? In which scripture are they written?

01:14:25.230 --> 01:14:28.045
Did Dnyandeva write these things?

01:14:28.246 --> 01:14:31.415
Why do you do this? All these things should go away.

01:14:31.616 --> 01:14:33.681
Doing haldi kumkum function

01:14:33.882 --> 01:14:38.346
do you ever mention about Sahaja Yoga in that function?

01:14:38.547 --> 01:14:42.216
Once the ladies gather, they give oti offerings, do this, do that.

01:14:42.417 --> 01:14:44.932
Now if anyone gets prosperity, they give Oti offerings to Me.

01:14:45.133 --> 01:14:47.828
I said, „Do not give Me Oti”.

01:14:48.029 --> 01:14:50.510
They said they will visit the Devi temple and offer the Oti.

01:14:50.711 --> 01:14:52.345
„Not to Me. I do not want”.

01:14:52.546 --> 01:14:56.452
If you wish to do something, do Sahaja Yoga.

01:14:56.717 --> 01:15:00.024
Just offering Oti, what will happen due to this?

01:15:00.225 --> 01:15:02.663
I have no benefit from this neither you have.

01:15:02.869 --> 01:15:04.282
I am telling very clearly.

01:15:04.483 --> 01:15:07.488
If you wish to make the Oti offering, do it in the Devi temple.

01:15:07.689 --> 01:15:10.204
But now you should stop all this.

01:15:10.405 --> 01:15:12.508
Enough now!

01:15:13.167 --> 01:15:17.412
Now enter into yourself. There is so much wealth inside, aquire it.

01:15:17.613 --> 01:15:21.599
There have been so many great sadhus and saints here.

01:15:22.238 --> 01:15:24.793
What did they teach?

01:15:24.994 --> 01:15:27.035
Have they taught this to us?

01:15:27.236 --> 01:15:31.511
First of all stop all the rituals.

01:15:31.712 --> 01:15:35.773
If they do not do this, they will keep on making lamp wicks.

01:15:35.974 --> 01:15:39.091
Stop all the ritualism.

01:15:39.758 --> 01:15:44.522
And above all, they don't have special knowledge about these things.

01:15:46.013 --> 01:15:49.942
They just keep on doing whatever has been said by their forefathers.

01:15:50.143 --> 01:15:54.214
To do this women also drag the men in with them.

01:15:55.832 --> 01:15:58.411
Ladies have more wisdom

01:15:58.612 --> 01:16:01.101
and they nurture the society.

01:16:01.302 --> 01:16:04.013
But if she is possessed by this type of bhoot,

01:16:04.214 --> 01:16:07.941
then she believes whatever the Brahmin says about her issues - that’s it.

01:16:08.142 --> 01:16:10.548
But due to this the children also become useless.

01:16:10.749 --> 01:16:13.036
They waste their time by doing nothing.

01:16:13.237 --> 01:16:16.710
So don’t attend the haldi kumkum ceremony.

01:16:17.003 --> 01:16:21.999
Only if the lady who invites for haldi kumkum speaks about Sahaj Yoga too

01:16:22.200 --> 01:16:24.340
then only you should attend, otherwise don’t.

01:16:24.541 --> 01:16:26.152
You should be firm on this.

01:16:26.353 --> 01:16:29.023
Is it only that I want Sahaja Yoga or you also want it?

01:16:29.224 --> 01:16:31.689
And don’t others want it too?

01:16:31.852 --> 01:16:34.229
Why don’t you also tell them about Sahaja Yoga?

01:16:34.430 --> 01:16:36.820
You will not tell there,

01:16:37.589 --> 01:16:42.230
that we are Sahaja Yogis and what we all have achieved.

01:16:42.431 --> 01:16:44.493
Same thing with men also.

01:16:44.694 --> 01:16:47.572
They seem to be under the influence of ladies.

01:16:47.773 --> 01:16:51.326
In our Maharashtra there are two types of people.

01:16:51.527 --> 01:16:53.888
Either they are very ritualistic

01:16:54.064 --> 01:16:56.616
or they are "intelligent” -

01:16:56.817 --> 01:16:59.687
means stupid but so-called intelligent.

01:16:59.888 --> 01:17:03.491
And due to "intelligence" they do not understand what Sahaja Yoga is.

01:17:03.691 --> 01:17:06.751
Because they have such sharp intellect they do not understand,

01:17:06.952 --> 01:17:09.142
they feel that it is some other falsification.

01:17:09.343 --> 01:17:12.672
My dear fellow, just do it and understand it.

01:17:12.873 --> 01:17:18.190
That is why you will be surprised Maharashtra’s progress is very less.

01:17:18.391 --> 01:17:21.101
And I have made tremendous effort in Maharashtra.

01:17:21.302 --> 01:17:24.512
I have worked hard by visiting so many villages. I have toiled.

01:17:24.713 --> 01:17:26.902
Even after working so hard year after year,

01:17:27.103 --> 01:17:29.782
Maharashtra has not reached that state.

01:17:29.983 --> 01:17:33.238
What is this? What is the reason for this?

01:17:33.753 --> 01:17:38.202
I feel that ritualism should be discarded. Right away.

01:17:39.094 --> 01:17:42.794
Nothing doing. It is not at all needed.

01:17:42.995 --> 01:17:48.420
Secondly, the men should not use their intellect too much.

01:17:48.621 --> 01:17:51.373
But where is the intellect?

01:17:52.427 --> 01:17:56.060
What is the use of such intellect

01:17:56.261 --> 01:17:59.901
that takes you on the wrong path?

01:18:00.102 --> 01:18:06.355
The intellectuals in Maharashtra are worse than the ritualists.

01:18:07.055 --> 01:18:10.316
Means these people are confused and have lost their way.

01:18:10.531 --> 01:18:13.486
It is difficult for them to give up because everyone has ego.

01:18:13.687 --> 01:18:15.300
They think they are very special.

01:18:15.500 --> 01:18:18.997
They think there cannot be any incarnation in today's world.

01:18:19.198 --> 01:18:20.812
Because they are as such

01:18:21.013 --> 01:18:24.918
why would there be an incarnation between these donkey people?

01:18:25.119 --> 01:18:28.210
They have such ideas about themselves.

01:18:28.411 --> 01:18:30.942
So called intellectuals of here,

01:18:31.149 --> 01:18:35.735
have done foolish deeds which have no end.

01:18:35.936 --> 01:18:39.408
They don’t want to understand, they don't want to listen.

01:18:39.623 --> 01:18:42.970
Because of this type of mentality how would anything go inside them?

01:18:43.171 --> 01:18:46.173
Hence the wave of over intelligence that has come in Maharashtra

01:18:46.374 --> 01:18:48.129
is more dangerous.

01:18:48.330 --> 01:18:50.152
They write books after books.

01:18:50.352 --> 01:18:52.320
Whatever they write it is really a lot.

01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:55.422
And then people say, “I have read in the book”.

01:18:55.623 --> 01:18:57.871
Whatever is written in the books, is it truth?

01:18:58.072 --> 01:19:01.343
Who are these people to write? What experience do they have?

01:19:01.544 --> 01:19:03.557
You people should tell them straight away

01:19:03.758 --> 01:19:06.841
that you do not agree with these useless things.

01:19:07.042 --> 01:19:09.363
They keep on criticising everyone.

01:19:09.570 --> 01:19:13.038
They criticise Shri Krishna, criticise Shri Rama.

01:19:13.239 --> 01:19:17.514
If not that, they criticise all these sadhus and saints.

01:19:17.715 --> 01:19:19.997
And they say that all this is blind faith.

01:19:20.198 --> 01:19:23.320
You don’t have faith, then how will you have blind faith?

01:19:23.520 --> 01:19:27.932
The one who has faith in himself only will go deep in Sahaja Yoga.

01:19:29.242 --> 01:19:33.469
Why would a person without faith in himself join Sahaja Yoga?

01:19:33.670 --> 01:19:36.769
Hence, find out such people.

01:19:37.202 --> 01:19:40.701
Such absolutely good people exist in our country.

01:19:40.902 --> 01:19:44.179
You should help them.

01:19:44.380 --> 01:19:49.161
I think, in Maharashtra there is a need to do a lot of work.

01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:51.227
We are experts in fighting.

01:19:51.428 --> 01:19:55.375
That is why in politics we are always having fights, fights and fights.

01:19:55.576 --> 01:19:59.656
But in Sahaja Yoga, how many people are there

01:19:59.857 --> 01:20:06.618
who have dedicated themselves to fulfil their aims?

01:20:06.825 --> 01:20:08.851
How many people are there?

01:20:09.052 --> 01:20:12.074
If there is one leader, they will find faults in him.

01:20:12.274 --> 01:20:14.812
„He is like this, Mataji, he is like that”.

01:20:15.013 --> 01:20:18.185
Even if we keep this aside, apart leadership,

01:20:18.386 --> 01:20:21.509
still they will tell a lot of other things to Me, such as:

01:20:21.710 --> 01:20:23.291
"My grandmother is ill”.

01:20:23.492 --> 01:20:26.461
"Oh, dear, she may be old, she may be ill, it is OK.

01:20:26.662 --> 01:20:30.225
Why do you want to go to this side?”. "My grandmother” - means who?

01:20:30.426 --> 01:20:32.390
The entire world is your grandmother,

01:20:32.591 --> 01:20:35.467
the entire world your relation. You are Sahaja Yogi.

01:20:35.668 --> 01:20:39.628
"Your grandmother, your father, your mother" - how is it possible?

01:20:39.867 --> 01:20:42.776
Are you not on the top of the world?

01:20:42.977 --> 01:20:47.057
Your level has changed, right? You relatives have changed.

01:20:47.258 --> 01:20:51.078
In olden days, bramhin used to marry a bramhin only.

01:20:51.814 --> 01:20:53.828
Marriage into another caste was a taboo.

01:20:54.029 --> 01:20:57.563
Is it like that now? Everything has got mixed up.

01:20:57.810 --> 01:21:00.487
Then why should Sahaja Yogis think

01:21:00.688 --> 01:21:05.012
that, ”This is my mother and this is your mother”.

01:21:05.213 --> 01:21:07.866
"Mine” and "yours” are gone.

01:21:08.067 --> 01:21:10.136
Now the entire world is yours.

01:21:10.337 --> 01:21:12.993
Has Dnyaneshwar said anything like this ever?

01:21:13.194 --> 01:21:15.200
We have had so many sadhus and saints.

01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:17.225
Has Tukaram ever said anything like this?

01:21:17.425 --> 01:21:19.955
Have they ever differentiated like "mine" and "yours"?

01:21:20.155 --> 01:21:23.080
Just to keep on saying the verses written by these saints,

01:21:23.280 --> 01:21:27.881
the meaning does not go inside the brain because of they grind away.

01:21:28.082 --> 01:21:30.420
So leaving apart all these things,

01:21:30.621 --> 01:21:35.748
a person should be honest about oneself:

01:21:36.737 --> 01:21:38.730
„What am I doing to myself?

01:21:38.931 --> 01:21:40.737
What have I done for myself?

01:21:40.937 --> 01:21:42.511
What I want to do for myself?”.

01:21:42.711 --> 01:21:44.258
You must see that.

01:21:44.459 --> 01:21:49.299
And after that you will realize and will get enlightened.

01:21:49.530 --> 01:21:51.607
You are a Sahaj Yogi.

01:21:51.790 --> 01:21:54.919
Were there ever so many Sahaja Yogis in the world?

01:21:55.120 --> 01:21:57.825
Two-four were there and they (saints) were tortured by people.

01:21:58.025 --> 01:22:01.014
Still what beautiful poems they have written.

01:22:01.215 --> 01:22:05.184
You belong to such a place, whose name itself is "Maha-rashtra” (great land).

01:22:05.406 --> 01:22:09.903
How can you become small frogs after coming here?

01:22:11.412 --> 01:22:14.032
Now leave these relatives.

01:22:14.233 --> 01:22:18.915
And your relatives are only those who are realized (“Hechi soyare hoti”)

01:22:19.130 --> 01:22:21.183
as said by saint Dnyaneshwar.

01:22:21.384 --> 01:22:23.615
Only these are your relatives.

01:22:23.816 --> 01:22:28.436
None else is your relative, that is clearly mentioned.

01:22:28.637 --> 01:22:30.857
But one should realize that.

01:22:31.058 --> 01:22:35.528
People just keep on reading ”Pasaydaan” (song written by saint Dnyaneshwar), read it, learnt by heart.

01:22:35.729 --> 01:22:38.698
Just learn everything by heart, that’s it.

01:22:39.641 --> 01:22:43.323
They learn without retaining anything.

01:22:45.617 --> 01:22:48.627
So, the people from Maharashtra

01:22:48.825 --> 01:22:52.902
should observe themselves with a humouros attitude that,

01:22:53.103 --> 01:22:57.078
”What am I doing? What is my work?”.

01:22:57.279 --> 01:22:59.914
You should come to Delhi and see.

01:23:00.115 --> 01:23:03.022
There are two-three very good Maharshtrians who have arrived there.

01:23:03.223 --> 01:23:07.080
They say, "Mataji, you should invite people from Maharashtra only".

01:23:07.281 --> 01:23:09.507
They are very good people”. I said, „Is that right?

01:23:09.708 --> 01:23:12.891
Go there for a few days, then you will know”.

01:23:13.430 --> 01:23:16.026
In Sahaja Yoga to become deep you need an effort first.

01:23:16.227 --> 01:23:20.256
I don’t say you should go to Himalaya and stand on one foot. No.

01:23:20.457 --> 01:23:23.130
But, ”Where am I going? What am I doing?

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:26.310
What am I living for?" That needs to be seen.

01:23:26.511 --> 01:23:29.246
Then only shower of blessings.

01:23:29.787 --> 01:23:35.015
Even for blessings, Sahastrara should be opened, completely.

01:23:35.215 --> 01:23:38.982
You must value yourself, but you don't.

01:23:39.183 --> 01:23:44.168
"Why it happened like this, that I don’t value myself?"

01:23:44.635 --> 01:23:49.323
We must decide that, "I am able do this, I am able to do that".

01:23:49.524 --> 01:23:54.133
And we should have big dreams

01:23:54.334 --> 01:23:57.751
that, "I will go to this place, that village to spread Sahaja Yoga".

01:23:57.942 --> 01:23:59.814
We should see such dreams.

01:24:00.015 --> 01:24:02.915
We should imagine such big things.

01:24:03.728 --> 01:24:07.524
You see, we, Indians, have accomplished so much work in the past.

01:24:07.725 --> 01:24:10.043
There was a queen of Jhansi. She was a woman.

01:24:10.244 --> 01:24:14.089
She said, "No, we will defeat the British people".

01:24:14.290 --> 01:24:17.878
She went to the war field taking her small child with her.

01:24:18.079 --> 01:24:19.732
And she died in the battlefield,

01:24:19.933 --> 01:24:23.359
but British people said, "Though we won over Jhansi,

01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.118
the glory is of Lakshmi Bai (the queen of Jhansi)".

01:24:26.319 --> 01:24:29.549
Such type of women were born in Maharashtra.

01:24:29.771 --> 01:24:33.420
And now, nothing of this kind is seen.

01:24:33.621 --> 01:24:36.097
Only decking up.

01:24:38.071 --> 01:24:42.117
Why I am saying this? Because I had bad experiences.

01:24:42.318 --> 01:24:46.165
Now all have started saying, "We don’t want Maharashtrian wife".

01:24:46.366 --> 01:24:48.633
These women misbehaved there.

01:24:48.834 --> 01:24:55.256
If I speak in Marathi others won't understand, but you will.

01:24:56.213 --> 01:24:58.071
These women went there and misbehaved

01:24:58.272 --> 01:25:00.721
and now they don’t want wife from Maharashtra.

01:25:00.921 --> 01:25:02.482
They have no education, nothing,

01:25:02.683 --> 01:25:05.170
still we married them thinking that it is our responsibility.

01:25:05.371 --> 01:25:07.870
But they brought ill fame to us only.

01:25:08.071 --> 01:25:11.767
Told you this as I have not complained to you untill today.

01:25:11.968 --> 01:25:15.556
I always kept on praising you, but it will not work now.

01:25:15.756 --> 01:25:19.380
Now I should see something concrete in front of Me.

01:25:19.581 --> 01:25:22.637
Hence next time I am going to ask everyone

01:25:22.838 --> 01:25:25.988
how many people you have given Realization to.

01:25:26.537 --> 01:25:30.636
In a way you are better than Gujaratis. They are very rigid.

01:25:30.837 --> 01:25:33.041
Sahaja Yoga is not going in their head.

01:25:33.241 --> 01:25:37.127
But even if it enters into your head, it is a waste.

01:25:38.225 --> 01:25:43.073
So, today everyone should make a resolution in their minds

01:25:43.273 --> 01:25:45.278
that, "Mataji, next time when you come here

01:25:45.479 --> 01:25:47.995
we will show you what all can be done in Maharashtra.

01:25:48.196 --> 01:25:50.556
Where have the valiant Marathas (warriors of Maharashtra) gone?

01:25:50.757 --> 01:25:52.851
Don’t know what happened.

01:25:53.052 --> 01:25:55.364
With the help of these warriors so much was accomplished.

01:25:55.565 --> 01:26:00.687
And you people are so educated good people, everything proper

01:26:00.888 --> 01:26:03.634
and you are of no help to Me.

01:26:04.999 --> 01:26:07.498
Hence this number should increase.

01:26:07.699 --> 01:26:11.523
And not only this, you should also progress.

01:26:11.724 --> 01:26:14.929
And I should see that in Maharashtra,

01:26:15.130 --> 01:26:17.726
Sahaja Yoga should reach the peak.

01:26:17.927 --> 01:26:19.948
Reach the summit.

01:26:20.149 --> 01:26:23.162
There is nothing to be said beyond this.

01:26:23.363 --> 01:26:25.324
It should be like this.

01:26:25.525 --> 01:26:28.451
Just make me speechless.

01:26:28.652 --> 01:26:30.420
How happy I will be if this happens.

01:26:30.620 --> 01:26:32.427
I was born here.

01:26:32.628 --> 01:26:35.945
And I studied everything in Marathi language.

01:26:36.146 --> 01:26:40.176
Even today I know Marathi quite well.

01:26:40.377 --> 01:26:44.199
But I cannot understand the minds of the Marathi people.

01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:47.580
I cannot understand the minds of Marathi people.

01:26:47.781 --> 01:26:52.292
Because my father and mother were of a very high caliber,

01:26:52.493 --> 01:26:56.942
due to them, I did not know that such people exist in Maharashtra.

01:26:57.142 --> 01:27:02.157
Similarly you should prove, "Mataji we are special.

01:27:02.467 --> 01:27:05.748
You entrusted us with such great responsibility.

01:27:05.948 --> 01:27:10.849
And we will prove it you that Maharashtra is no less".

01:27:11.050 --> 01:27:15.333
You are all great warriors,

01:27:15.534 --> 01:27:17.497
and now is the time to show your bravery.

01:27:17.698 --> 01:27:19.481
Just being Marathi means what?

01:27:19.682 --> 01:27:22.942
Just to call oneself Maharashtrian is a waste.

01:27:23.143 --> 01:27:26.832
That is the opinion of people about you.

01:27:27.033 --> 01:27:28.474
It should not be like this.

01:27:28.675 --> 01:27:31.486
Hence understand Sahaja Yoga completely,

01:27:31.687 --> 01:27:37.828
practise it and make Maharashtra proud.

01:27:40.292 --> 01:27:46.621
I say that with infinite blessings to you.

01:27:46.822 --> 01:27:49.514
Please accept it.
