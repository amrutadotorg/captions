00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:36.858
I'm sure Phil must have

00:00:37.358 --> 00:00:38.432
explained to you

00:00:39.349 --> 00:00:41.349
the mechanism

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:43.849
of our evolution

00:00:48.464 --> 00:00:50.464
as you see before yourself

00:00:51.823 --> 00:00:53.823
that there are different centers

00:00:54.323 --> 00:00:56.323
at the different level of the body

00:00:58.255 --> 00:01:00.255
and all these centers denote

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.596
our different stages of our evolution

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:08.822
these centers cannot be seen

00:01:09.452 --> 00:01:11.452
there are subtle centers

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.660
placed in the medulla oblongata

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
means in the spinal cord

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:19.503
and also in the brain

00:01:22.477 --> 00:01:25.778
as I told you yesterday that

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460
God has created us

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.960
for the purpose

00:01:32.475 --> 00:01:34.475
and the whole thing has been done

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:38.402
very beautifully, with great compassion, care.

00:01:40.236 --> 00:01:42.236
is one very delicately

00:01:42.736 --> 00:01:46.045
and all these centers denote within us

00:01:46.441 --> 00:01:48.441
the kind of the growth

00:01:48.941 --> 00:01:51.331
that has been manifesting

00:01:51.571 --> 00:01:52.806
one after another.

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.306
But at the human stage

00:01:55.494 --> 00:01:56.720
we are still

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.758
in transition stage

00:01:59.946 --> 00:02:02.466
because we do not know the meaning of our life.

00:02:03.305 --> 00:02:05.305
The meaning of our life

00:02:05.805 --> 00:02:07.115
will only be known

00:02:07.615 --> 00:02:09.615
when we become connected

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.118
with that power which has

00:02:12.618 --> 00:02:13.644
created us,

00:02:14.378 --> 00:02:16.378
the power that has evolved us,

00:02:18.571 --> 00:02:20.571
the power that desired

00:02:21.071 --> 00:02:22.153
for our creation

00:02:22.653 --> 00:02:24.653
that activated

00:02:25.153 --> 00:02:28.127
for our creation and the one that evolved us.

00:02:28.627 --> 00:02:32.548
These three powers are indicated in those three lines.

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.051
The left side is the power of desire,

00:02:36.781 --> 00:02:39.610
which looks after the past, the sub-conscious 

00:02:39.682 --> 00:02:41.183
and the collective sub-conscious, 

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:44.865
and the another one which activates is on the right hand side 

00:02:45.365 --> 00:02:47.498
which looks after the action, 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.165
the activation, the creation 

00:02:50.665 --> 00:02:54.928
up to a stage when life started taking its form.

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.445
Then comes in the carbon atom.

00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:05.606
Carbon atom is a very important pivotal element that was created

00:03:06.642 --> 00:03:10.544
at a point where it had four valences which it couldn't

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:13.019
depart or put received.

00:03:13.948 --> 00:03:20.434
This came as a special catalyst, we can say,

00:03:20.934 --> 00:03:26.988
which started creating life. Now, the life was created, 

00:03:27.488 --> 00:03:32.766
but, after creating that life as a unicellular animal,

00:03:32.998 --> 00:03:35.213
we had to become human beings.

00:03:35.928 --> 00:03:42.967
The chairs do not grow, this hall will not grow,

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:46.839
nothing is going to grow which is dead.

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:50.885
But, whatever is living grows and evolves.

00:03:52.726 --> 00:03:55.324
We have become human beings at a stage

00:03:55.824 --> 00:03:58.923
where that center is near the neck.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.120
Where we have raised our neck up,

00:04:03.156 --> 00:04:08.409
where the animals put their head up.

00:04:09.177 --> 00:04:12.473
A new system started building up within themselves,

00:04:12.758 --> 00:04:15.138
by which a crossing took place

00:04:15.638 --> 00:04:20.327
and this crossing of the energies created these two pouches

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:22.666
called ego and superego.

00:04:24.561 --> 00:04:26.561
Because there was no outlet.

00:04:28.456 --> 00:04:30.944
The animals have both the feet and both the hands 

00:04:31.444 --> 00:04:37.231
on the ground which comes from the hind legs and goes

00:04:37.332 --> 00:04:39.121
through the forelegs. 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.378
But in the human beings, when he raised his head,

00:04:43.414 --> 00:04:48.328
then a new system developed within him by which he created ego.

00:04:48.828 --> 00:04:52.090
When he worked, when he took action 

00:04:53.186 --> 00:04:57.631
action through his mental and his physical capacities,

00:04:58.131 --> 00:05:00.608
he developed a system called ego.

00:05:01.644 --> 00:05:04.622
Actually ego is a complete myth.

00:05:05.122 --> 00:05:09.447
Because we really do not do anything. As I said, we only do dead work.

00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:12.215
We cannot do one living work. 

00:05:13.681 --> 00:05:15.681
We cannot do any living work. 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:22.143
And so the ego that is within us is just a myth that we are doing it.

00:05:23.931 --> 00:05:31.070
So this myth rises and the superego at the animal stage is pressed back

00:05:31.838 --> 00:05:35.029
and when both of them combine on top of your head, 

00:05:36.548 --> 00:05:38.935
till about the age of twelve years,

00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:41.757
the calcification takes place

00:05:42.257 --> 00:05:45.381
and you become yourself,

00:05:45.881 --> 00:05:50.768
you become completely independent. The "I"ness develops.

00:05:51.268 --> 00:05:54.342
That means you become like an egg.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:58.906
Now you are a separate entity, a free entity,

00:05:59.674 --> 00:06:04.266
which can work out the left and the right side,

00:06:04.927 --> 00:06:09.247
which is like a brake and the accelerator of a car

00:06:10.176 --> 00:06:15.765
and learn how to use them to develop balance within you

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:19.587
by making mistakes,

00:06:20.087 --> 00:06:24.161
by experimenting, you develop your wisdom in the center.

00:06:26.217 --> 00:06:30.750
Sometimes the human beings go to the extremes, as I told you yesterday,

00:06:31.143 --> 00:06:34.184
how they go on to the right side into the extremes

00:06:34.308 --> 00:06:37.849
and what diseases they develop and what problems they develop.

00:06:38.081 --> 00:06:42.396
In the same way, I told you a day earlier

00:06:42.896 --> 00:06:47.072
that when you go to the left, how you develop your problems

00:06:47.196 --> 00:06:48.699
of emotional side and

00:06:48.823 --> 00:06:52.363
even a disease like cancer comes to you from the left extremes.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.733
Now, in the center is the evolutionary process,

00:06:58.233 --> 00:07:01.828
is the power of evolution, is the power of your sustenance. 

00:07:02.864 --> 00:07:06.675
For example, carbon has four valences, that means,

00:07:07.121 --> 00:07:10.285
the carbon has got the sustenance of four.

00:07:12.394 --> 00:07:14.673
Human beings have ten sustenances

00:07:15.173 --> 00:07:19.007
which are expressed in the Bible as the Ten Commandments.

00:07:19.507 --> 00:07:22.058
These are for the sustenance of human beings.

00:07:22.773 --> 00:07:25.923
When Moses was on this earth, that time

00:07:26.423 --> 00:07:30.630
it was too early to talk of Self-Realization, about Spirit.

00:07:31.023 --> 00:07:33.503
As the tree was growing, the tree of life,

00:07:33.788 --> 00:07:37.410
he talked about the tree of life, tree of fire, 

00:07:37.481 --> 00:07:42.579
about Kundalini he did talk. But, he more talked about the sustenance,

00:07:42.918 --> 00:07:46.295
about the maintenance of the balance, of the being.

00:07:47.224 --> 00:07:49.386
He was more particular on that point,

00:07:49.618 --> 00:07:54.496
because that was the time where people had to learn to be in a balance.

00:07:56.927 --> 00:07:58.927
He didn't talk of baptism,

00:07:59.266 --> 00:08:01.746
for example, Jews don't believe in baptism.

00:08:02.943 --> 00:08:06.838
But he did say that somebody is going to come,

00:08:07.338 --> 00:08:12.426
Maseeha, and He is going to give you the Spirit.

00:08:12.497 --> 00:08:14.529
He is going to give you the Realization.

00:08:15.029 --> 00:08:18.068
But, Jews as you know, denied Christ, they didn't believe in Him

00:08:18.944 --> 00:08:22.906
and that's how Christ was crucified.

00:08:25.033 --> 00:08:29.695
Now Christ is a very, very important advent on this earth. 

00:08:30.195 --> 00:08:33.435
Apart from other advents, first of all, I'll tell you

00:08:33.669 --> 00:08:36.342
about Christ, how important He is 

00:08:36.761 --> 00:08:41.240
and how He plays a very important role in the human beings.

00:08:42.472 --> 00:08:45.053
People just talk of Christ - Christ, Christ.

00:08:45.146 --> 00:08:48.493
We should go to the church, say Christ, Jesus Christ is the one I see.

00:08:48.586 --> 00:08:51.308
So many posters saying Jesus Christ is within you,

00:08:51.564 --> 00:08:55.572
Jesus Christ is coming, Jesus Christ is here, but where?

00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:01.712
Where is He? Where does He reside within us? He resides

00:09:01.968 --> 00:09:05.292
in the center which is the sixth center called as Agnya.

00:09:06.036 --> 00:09:09.279
This center is placed between the pituitary

00:09:09.454 --> 00:09:12.283
and pineal body, is a very subtle center

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:14.510
and has got two sub-plexuses.

00:09:16.221 --> 00:09:18.221
He incarnates there

00:09:19.688 --> 00:09:22.250
as the embodiment of innocence.

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:27.079
That's why He is such a powerful deity who incarnates 

00:09:27.172 --> 00:09:29.746
and settles down in that area.

00:09:30.978 --> 00:09:36.016
His coming on this earth was very important because the ego and superego

00:09:36.191 --> 00:09:37.492
had crossed each other

00:09:37.585 --> 00:09:40.550
and there was no space for the Kundalini to pass through.

00:09:41.619 --> 00:09:45.037
That is the cross where He was crucified.

00:09:45.293 --> 00:09:48.327
And when He came on this earth,

00:09:50.291 --> 00:09:56.601
four thousand years before that, Shri Krishna described that the power

00:09:57.752 --> 00:10:03.857
which is divine cannot be destroyed. The Spirit cannot be destroyed,

00:10:04.357 --> 00:10:08.778
it cannot be burnt, it cannot be blown off.

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:14.412
And that's why Christ had to come on this earth to establish that truth.

00:10:14.912 --> 00:10:18.505
He was one who was "Aum", the one

00:10:18.842 --> 00:10:23.270
who was the Primordial sound and that's why He could walk on top

00:10:23.347 --> 00:10:27.295
of the water. Only the sound can travel on top of the water

00:10:27.388 --> 00:10:29.220
because it has no gravity to fall down.

00:10:30.615 --> 00:10:35.806
It was a special creation of Jesus Christ in the heavens, it's described

00:10:36.062 --> 00:10:41.041
in many books - Indian books, scriptures, He is described as Mahavishnu.

00:10:41.704 --> 00:10:47.388
Of course, the people who call themselves Christians got their Christianity

00:10:48.132 --> 00:10:54.192
from various sources and they interpreted it the way they wanted to.

00:10:54.692 --> 00:10:58.033
For example, St. Paul in the Bible 

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:01.567
is not a realized soul, nor he has got anything to do with Christ.

00:11:01.664 --> 00:11:04.990
Nothing. He never met Christ, he had nothing to do,

00:11:05.627 --> 00:11:09.985
he just came forward, he was killing Christians, he was a half Jew

00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:14.643
and a half Greek, and he had bribed people to get a Roman 

00:11:14.736 --> 00:11:17.753
visa or something like that.

00:11:17.928 --> 00:11:21.738
And he was there as a Roman soldier. And he was killing people,

00:11:21.913 --> 00:11:24.685
he was killing Christians. And suddenly

00:11:24.778 --> 00:11:28.197
he says that he saw a light and he, a self-appointed man

00:11:28.290 --> 00:11:31.551
and I don't know why he is in the Bible, he should not have been there.

00:11:31.726 --> 00:11:33.969
He is a very misguiding personality 

00:11:34.469 --> 00:11:39.831
and that misguidance is today acting against, against Christ.

00:11:40.087 --> 00:11:41.762
Actually, I have a feeling

00:11:41.855 --> 00:11:44.991
that always, when such a great man comes in on this earth,

00:11:45.491 --> 00:11:48.236
and His work starts, some negative forces

00:11:48.411 --> 00:11:52.020
become very subtle and come forward to help

00:11:52.276 --> 00:11:55.755
the cause and actually they are against God.

00:11:56.824 --> 00:12:00.234
This I will prove it you later on, why I am saying so.

00:12:00.734 --> 00:12:05.739
But, Jesus Christ Himself, He came on this earth

00:12:06.239 --> 00:12:12.681
because we had a problem - the problem was of ego.

00:12:13.181 --> 00:12:17.944
The problem was, whatever work we did, whatever 

00:12:19.013 --> 00:12:24.385
bad things we did created an institution of sin,

00:12:24.885 --> 00:12:32.815
we became sinners that made us a personality which was sinning.

00:12:33.315 --> 00:12:38.868
And He came on this earth to suck all the sins from us.

00:12:39.368 --> 00:12:42.878
It is all promised in the ancient scriptures

00:12:42.971 --> 00:12:48.575
that such and such personality will be coming and when He comes, He

00:12:49.075 --> 00:12:53.721
is awakened by the Kundalini and if He will be awakened

00:12:53.896 --> 00:12:58.877
in the Kundalini, then He will suck your sins. So, there will be no Karmas,

00:12:59.214 --> 00:13:03.615
there will be no sin, not at all. So He came on this earth

00:13:03.871 --> 00:13:09.450
for sucking our sins, to take our sins, He died for our sins, we all say this.

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:12.191
Then why do you have the idea of sin anymore?

00:13:12.284 --> 00:13:15.373
Why do you go and confess about your sins?

00:13:15.548 --> 00:13:18.915
Because if Christ is there and if He is awakened,

00:13:19.008 --> 00:13:21.358
He will definitely suck our sins.

00:13:21.858 --> 00:13:25.752
And the second idea people had that we have to suffer.

00:13:25.845 --> 00:13:28.721
This was the idea which came from the Jews,

00:13:28.896 --> 00:13:31.317
that we have to suffer, we must all suffer.

00:13:32.712 --> 00:13:36.106
This must have come from the time when Moses was there.

00:13:36.199 --> 00:13:39.945
Now thousand of years have passed that this Moses was there

00:13:40.120 --> 00:13:44.056
and that it was promised that somebody is going to come

00:13:44.312 --> 00:13:47.975
who will suffer for you, once and for all. And all your sufferings

00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:52.798
He will take. Such a great personality was that of Christ.

00:13:52.973 --> 00:13:57.411
He came on this earth, He went through all the sufferings and still

00:13:57.586 --> 00:14:01.194
even Christians go on saying, we have to suffer. Why?

00:14:01.450 --> 00:14:04.284
Has He not suffered sufficiently for you?

00:14:04.377 --> 00:14:08.615
Are you going to suffer little more than Him? Why have you to suffer?

00:14:08.708 --> 00:14:13.249
Only thing what has to happen in you is that Christ is to be awakened.

00:14:13.424 --> 00:14:16.471
If Christ is awakened within you, you will be amazed

00:14:16.971 --> 00:14:20.478
that all these so-called sufferings disappear just like that.

00:14:20.978 --> 00:14:25.639
There are no sufferings anymore left. We have seen patients

00:14:25.976 --> 00:14:28.401
of cancer who are suffering very much,

00:14:28.494 --> 00:14:33.719
who are told by doctors that you will die within two weeks time. Is a fact.

00:14:35.357 --> 00:14:40.518
Now, if their Kundalini is awakened, their cancer disappears,

00:14:40.774 --> 00:14:45.836
all their pain disappears, all their agony disappears and they feel very light

00:14:45.929 --> 00:14:50.783
and they feel that they have become collectively conscious,

00:14:51.039 --> 00:14:54.247
that they are saved. They all know that they are saved.

00:14:54.503 --> 00:14:58.648
Once it happens, then immediately, the lightness

00:14:58.741 --> 00:15:03.629
of the whole mind, the lightness of the body, the lightness

00:15:03.804 --> 00:15:08.770
of your being is felt and you feel so light as if you are floating

00:15:09.107 --> 00:15:13.313
in the joy of God. And this is what was promised

00:15:13.488 --> 00:15:14.968
and we should have expected.

00:15:15.114 --> 00:15:19.133
But what we did was to go back to the same old stuff,

00:15:19.245 --> 00:15:21.995
which was thousands of years back without understanding

00:15:22.107 --> 00:15:23.967
that if it was the growth,

00:15:24.162 --> 00:15:27.762
if it was the living process, the living process always

00:15:27.763 --> 00:15:31.533
transforms one from another stage to another stage.

00:15:31.590 --> 00:15:35.634
Like we can see a seed, seed becomes a root, the root

00:15:36.106 --> 00:15:39.562
then has the shoots, and the shoot has other parts

00:15:39.646 --> 00:15:43.600
one by one till it becomes a blossoming flower,

00:15:43.740 --> 00:15:48.091
flowering tree and then that tree bears fruits.

00:15:48.591 --> 00:15:52.373
And then these fruits also fall off. In the same way,

00:15:52.485 --> 00:15:55.441
if life has to grow through evolutionary process,

00:15:56.634 --> 00:15:59.310
there has to be stages by which we have to move,

00:15:59.367 --> 00:16:03.107
it is not that every time that somebody comes, he starts a new religion.

00:16:03.275 --> 00:16:08.010
How can it be? Christ has said, those who are not against Me are with Me.

00:16:08.732 --> 00:16:12.396
Now, who are those people who are with Him? He said it very clearly.

00:16:12.757 --> 00:16:16.678
Even Mohammed accepted Christ as a very great soul and

00:16:16.735 --> 00:16:20.614
He has said that you must wait for the day of resurrection.

00:16:21.003 --> 00:16:23.003
But who is talking of Day of Resurrection?

00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:28.089
Among Muslims, nobody talks of that, they only talk of the day of doom.

00:16:28.312 --> 00:16:32.956
I don't know why human beings are so anxious to go to that day of doom

00:16:33.068 --> 00:16:37.106
without going to the resurrection. We are here to be resurrected

00:16:37.274 --> 00:16:42.203
and redeemed and that is what is Sahaja Yoga. Sahaja Yoga

00:16:42.315 --> 00:16:46.575
not only counsels you, tells you all about it, it gives you

00:16:46.632 --> 00:16:51.294
redemption and a comfort, a comfort that is,

00:16:51.655 --> 00:16:57.401
from the sins and from the worries of life. This is what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:58.344 --> 00:17:00.909
Now there are other deities who are settled down

00:17:01.021 --> 00:17:05.307
in other centers, about which you can read in the book, it's given very clearly.

00:17:05.336 --> 00:17:09.781
But people get shocked about it, when I told them that these are deities

00:17:09.893 --> 00:17:13.503
are placed here, there and there. For example, if I talk to Indians,

00:17:13.615 --> 00:17:16.892
they think I am preaching about Christ, I am supporting Christ;

00:17:16.949 --> 00:17:20.331
I am making everybody Christians, that's how they started looking at Me.

00:17:20.554 --> 00:17:23.697
And when I tell you about Shri Krishna, you will say the same to Me,

00:17:23.754 --> 00:17:27.663
because human beings have a habit to form a club.

00:17:28.551 --> 00:17:30.579
Now if you are following Christ,

00:17:30.719 --> 00:17:32.357
then you cannot see anything beyond,

00:17:32.441 --> 00:17:34.193
you see, you just get closed like that.

00:17:34.333 --> 00:17:38.162
But you don't see even what has these Christian church done to you.

00:17:38.357 --> 00:17:40.556
I was born myself in a Christian Church

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.556
and I know they have done nothing whatsoever.

00:17:44.056 --> 00:17:48.033
Same about Hindus - what have their temples done for anyone?

00:17:48.284 --> 00:17:52.351
Go to these Muslims - what have they done for these Muslims? Nothing.

00:17:52.408 --> 00:17:56.633
Except for building big, big, huge mosques and churches

00:17:56.690 --> 00:18:01.163
and temples and half of the England, I am told that the church is owning.

00:18:01.275 --> 00:18:04.512
How are they going to recognize Christ? When Christ comes in,

00:18:04.541 --> 00:18:08.464
are you going to recognize Him? How can you? Which is the way?

00:18:09.075 --> 00:18:12.285
There are many who say, we pray to God, we say God,

00:18:12.397 --> 00:18:14.040
give us some job now,

00:18:14.817 --> 00:18:17.157
we use God for every third person.

00:18:18.433 --> 00:18:22.849
God is not in your pocket. You have to be connected with God.

00:18:23.017 --> 00:18:26.716
You have to be one with Him. Otherwise, you will be arrested.

00:18:26.800 --> 00:18:30.391
As without connection, you cannot approach anybody in authority,

00:18:30.614 --> 00:18:34.252
how can you approach the One who is the Authority of all the Authorities,

00:18:34.392 --> 00:18:37.575
without even having any connection or protocol?

00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:41.950
So all these people who are supposed to be in charge of Christ,

00:18:41.979 --> 00:18:45.178
in charge of Shri Krishna, in charge of Shri Rama,

00:18:45.235 --> 00:18:48.802
are all just I must say, are telling lies.

00:18:48.859 --> 00:18:49.507
Because they are not.

00:18:51.281 --> 00:18:52.922
They have nothing to do with them.

00:18:53.588 --> 00:18:57.135
None of them can really deliver the goods.

00:18:57.247 --> 00:18:59.696
On the contrary, if you go and tell them

00:18:59.780 --> 00:19:01.502
that this is the time of judgment,

00:19:01.781 --> 00:19:04.473
and this is the time where you must accept

00:19:04.890 --> 00:19:06.279
that you are to be redeemed,

00:19:06.363 --> 00:19:09.393
that's the main thing, you are to be redeemed, if you are not redeemed,

00:19:09.644 --> 00:19:13.345
then all those things are absolutely useless for human beings.

00:19:13.568 --> 00:19:16.169
The emancipation of human beings has to be brought in -

00:19:16.198 --> 00:19:19.773
if it cannot be done, then give up all these nonsensical ideas and

00:19:19.830 --> 00:19:24.418
dogmas and fighting things and come up and see for yourself what is reality.

00:19:24.918 --> 00:19:28.881
But they'll not do it, because they exist on our ignorance, they exist

00:19:28.993 --> 00:19:32.818
because we are ignorant about it. The force exists within you,

00:19:33.401 --> 00:19:37.992
the Spirit exists within you, you don't have to go to these places

00:19:38.076 --> 00:19:41.908
where there is no talk of Spirit at all, no talk of Self-Realization.

00:19:42.048 --> 00:19:46.523
In every religion, it is said that you have to get your Self-Realization,

00:19:46.663 --> 00:19:50.162
you are to be born again, you must be born again.

00:19:50.330 --> 00:19:53.957
In America, I met so many people, and they told Me, Mother I am twice born.

00:19:54.041 --> 00:19:57.336
I said, how? We belong to an organization that is twice born.

00:19:57.448 --> 00:20:00.202
I said, the whole organization is twice born or what?

00:20:00.536 --> 00:20:04.459
And they believe in such mythical things that they are twice born.

00:20:04.488 --> 00:20:08.242
I said, what is the sign of a twice born?

00:20:08.299 --> 00:20:10.237
How can you make out a twice born?

00:20:10.294 --> 00:20:13.749
Anybody can stand up and say, I am twice born. Are you going to believe that person?

00:20:14.914 --> 00:20:18.317
Some people are so simple that anybody says anything, they just believe them,

00:20:19.039 --> 00:20:21.324
but that's not so. A 'twice born'

00:20:21.436 --> 00:20:24.143
has to be collectively conscious person

00:20:24.366 --> 00:20:27.262
and a twice born has to give you the power

00:20:28.565 --> 00:20:33.862
of your Spirit and that when you become twice born,

00:20:33.974 --> 00:20:35.974
you should be able to do that to others.

00:20:36.474 --> 00:20:40.383
Like Blake has said, that Men of God will become Prophets

00:20:40.523 --> 00:20:44.105
and these Prophets will have powers to make others Prophets.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:46.880
He said it so clearly for you English people,

00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:50.718
but I don't think you people like him very much. Because

00:20:50.747 --> 00:20:54.279
very few people I have seen, who really appreciate Blake

00:20:54.308 --> 00:20:56.783
and some of them have said that he is mad. Naturally,

00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:59.796
among all the mad people, a sane person may look mad also.

00:21:00.074 --> 00:21:02.802
But he is the one who has so clearly said

00:21:03.163 --> 00:21:05.893
and in this country, this great man should be born

00:21:05.977 --> 00:21:08.709
and should talk about Jerusalem is remarkable.

00:21:09.625 --> 00:21:13.053
Because you cannot think, in England, where people just

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:17.013
believe in dominating other countries and using their

00:21:17.093 --> 00:21:22.349
power to dominate others, you could get Jerusalem established.

00:21:22.849 --> 00:21:28.232
But what he said was of these days, when those false ideas have dropped off,

00:21:28.344 --> 00:21:32.735
when people do not think of domination, they do not think of materialism,

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.920
they are fed up with all these things and they are seeking today.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:40.114
And who are these seekers? These seekers are the men of God.

00:21:40.254 --> 00:21:41.789
So recognize yourself.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:45.825
First of all, you must recognize yourselves before recognizing anybody else

00:21:45.937 --> 00:21:50.577
that you are seekers and that you are men of God.

00:21:52.019 --> 00:21:55.771
Unless and until you have found God, you are not going to be happy

00:21:55.883 --> 00:22:00.135
by all these nonsensical alternatives people are giving.

00:22:00.884 --> 00:22:04.590
The other day, I said that there are some people who are just jumping,

00:22:04.619 --> 00:22:10.082
dancing - is this the way you are going to become twice born?

00:22:10.277 --> 00:22:13.734
Is absurd. How can you be? How can you believe

00:22:13.818 --> 00:22:16.832
that such absurd thing that you can otherwise also do it,

00:22:16.916 --> 00:22:20.575
if want to jump, what is there, you just lift your leg, you can jump.

00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.282
What is so great? Is it jumping and screaming and shouting

00:22:25.422 --> 00:22:29.123
and talking nonsense, is it what you are going to achieve?

00:22:30.981 --> 00:22:34.842
On the contrary, you are going to achieve something

00:22:35.065 --> 00:22:39.305
that will make your awareness much more alert,

00:22:39.445 --> 00:22:43.049
the awareness that will be collectively conscious.

00:22:43.161 --> 00:22:46.559
In your awareness, you should be able to feel others.

00:22:46.699 --> 00:22:49.689
You should be able to feel yourself, your own being.

00:22:50.106 --> 00:22:53.725
And that is what is important.

00:22:54.114 --> 00:22:58.016
Now, these other methods impress people. 

00:22:58.045 --> 00:23:00.350
I don't why this circus impresses them.

00:23:00.745 --> 00:23:04.301
If they say ten people dancing on the streets, Oxford Street

00:23:04.441 --> 00:23:07.946
with a dhoti, they are singing "Hare Rama Hare Krishna",

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.695
people say, "Oh, ho, oh, what godly, divine people are".

00:23:10.835 --> 00:23:13.854
They are not to advertise it on the streets of Oxford street and

00:23:13.938 --> 00:23:17.446
other street and wear those funny dresses and funnily dancing,

00:23:17.530 --> 00:23:19.530
is that the way are you going to God?

00:23:21.194 --> 00:23:25.036
Use your brains. You are one of the brainiest people in the whole world.

00:23:25.093 --> 00:23:29.092
Use your brains and find out, is this the way are you going to do it?

00:23:30.479 --> 00:23:35.266
Something has to happen within yourself and that within

00:23:35.905 --> 00:23:42.199
is just now, the time is today, you have to get it.

00:23:42.699 --> 00:23:46.479
I am so very happy to see that so many people came today

00:23:46.571 --> 00:23:50.381
and that they are so anxious to get to their Realization.

00:23:50.473 --> 00:23:53.951
Now, after Realization, when this ascent takes place,

00:23:55.063 --> 00:23:59.726
when the Kundalini rises and you start feeling the cool breeze coming out here,

00:23:59.954 --> 00:24:02.765
people may say, what's there in a cool breeze,

00:24:02.859 --> 00:24:05.432
now this is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:24:05.592 --> 00:24:09.393
It is all over, all pervading. You can feel it all over, actually some people

00:24:09.417 --> 00:24:12.708
start looking at the window, is it coming from the window, if the window is open.

00:24:12.766 --> 00:24:15.397
it's that. That is clear cut to some people.

00:24:15.557 --> 00:24:21.173
Now, when you start feeling it, you must use it. You must establish it.

00:24:21.673 --> 00:24:25.290
If you start using it, then only you will know the value of it.

00:24:25.348 --> 00:24:28.296
If you have not used it, how will you know what is that?

00:24:28.388 --> 00:24:31.862
This is the Spirit manifesting

00:24:32.056 --> 00:24:36.546
and you have to find out whether it is true or not by using it.

00:24:36.706 --> 00:24:40.251
Supposing I give you hundred rupees which is Indian money,

00:24:40.547 --> 00:24:44.025
then you don't know what rupees are. You must use them in the market

00:24:44.117 --> 00:24:47.763
and then only you will know the value what it is. In the same way,

00:24:47.855 --> 00:24:52.937
when I say that the Realization only takes place

00:24:52.995 --> 00:24:57.272
by only one method and that is the method of Kundalini awakening within you,

00:24:57.432 --> 00:25:02.210
like a primule in a seed rises only by one method, there are not ten methods

00:25:02.302 --> 00:25:07.440
that a seed sprouts. The seed has got a primule which has to germinate

00:25:07.498 --> 00:25:10.249
and it creates that tree which you see.

00:25:10.307 --> 00:25:15.833
Whatever may be the type of trees or anything,

00:25:15.857 --> 00:25:20.176
its the only the way it germinates is through primule, in the same way,

00:25:20.676 --> 00:25:24.743
when your actualization has to take place, this Kundalini which is

00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:27.154
placed at the triangular bone has to rise.

00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:33.371
And when She rises and pierces through your fontanel bone area,

00:25:34.109 --> 00:25:38.557
you really get your real baptism. Not artificial.

00:25:38.615 --> 00:25:43.074
You cannot give an artificial baptism. Actually, Blake has said,

00:25:43.132 --> 00:25:45.502
the priest cursed me on my head.

00:25:45.594 --> 00:25:48.543
It's true, because he has no right to touch his head.

00:25:48.771 --> 00:25:50.423
He is not a realized soul.

00:25:50.549 --> 00:25:53.745
Priest is not a realized soul, they are self appointed. You cannot

00:25:53.871 --> 00:25:57.748
become a priest in a theological college or anything man made stuff,

00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:01.359
it's all artificial. Whatever is man made is artificial, isn't it?

00:26:02.165 --> 00:26:07.583
Whatever is God made is real and God made things are within you.

00:26:07.845 --> 00:26:11.463
But after Realization, when you are established,

00:26:11.657 --> 00:26:15.520
you yourself have supreme powers, you can do so many things

00:26:15.578 --> 00:26:20.549
after that, that you are amazed at your own powers. You are surprised at yourself,

00:26:20.641 --> 00:26:24.667
that you are so glorious, so beautiful, so wonderful

00:26:24.827 --> 00:26:28.440
and so blissful - you become like a magnet for others.

00:26:28.532 --> 00:26:32.028
People are surprised at you, all your priorities change,

00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:35.426
all your habits drop out, all kinds of nonsensical things

00:26:35.552 --> 00:26:39.613
that were so much bothering you just drop off. And with that,

00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:44.738
all these centers are enlightened. And every center has a blessing to give.

00:26:44.864 --> 00:26:48.244
For example, the Nabhi, that is in the center here, navel center,

00:26:48.302 --> 00:26:51.489
has a blessing that Krishna has said Yogakshemam Vahaamyaham -

00:26:51.887 --> 00:26:55.885
that when you get yoga, first yoga, He didn't say Kshema Yoga,

00:26:56.045 --> 00:26:59.449
then when you get the union, you get the well being.

00:26:59.541 --> 00:27:03.523
Now well being is your achievement.

00:27:04.227 --> 00:27:06.950
Not that you become very rich like Ford, that's extreme,

00:27:07.042 --> 00:27:10.715
that's nonsensical, it's a headache. But you get a satisfied person.

00:27:11.215 --> 00:27:13.688
You are looked after, God looks after you.

00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:18.840
We don't believe in God the way He is really. He is God Almighty.

00:27:19.748 --> 00:27:23.338
He is God with all the powers

00:27:23.430 --> 00:27:26.985
and His power is doing all these wonderful things that we see,

00:27:27.485 --> 00:27:30.157
which are living things. Every second,

00:27:30.657 --> 00:27:34.158
billions and billions of flowers are coming out

00:27:34.216 --> 00:27:37.549
and you cannot imagine to what extent it is powerful.

00:27:37.699 --> 00:27:41.807
And this power when you feel within your reach,

00:27:42.307 --> 00:27:48.668
you can maneuver it, use it. And be glorified by that.

00:27:49.168 --> 00:27:56.036
 Sahaja Yoga is here to establish all the religions of the world in one

00:27:57.619 --> 00:28:01.115
thread - to integrate all of them and integrate

00:28:01.178 --> 00:28:03.668
all the great incarnations of the world in one.

00:28:04.356 --> 00:28:07.742
Because they are within us, they are not separate,

00:28:08.242 --> 00:28:10.794
they are all together, they are one family,

00:28:11.127 --> 00:28:16.057
only we come at different levels of our evolution.

00:28:16.411 --> 00:28:20.237
And have misjudged them, misunderstood them and we are fighting.

00:28:21.508 --> 00:28:23.301
As I have said many a times,

00:28:23.572 --> 00:28:26.430
that from the trees, we remove the beautiful flowers,

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:29.667
which are nurtured and nourished

00:28:29.917 --> 00:28:34.667
and developed by one sap in the tree. And then we fight

00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:40.092
for these flowers which are dead, ugly that this is mine, this is mine.

00:28:41.155 --> 00:28:45.687
And that is what is very important to understand that

00:28:45.895 --> 00:28:51.649
God has created this world not to hate each other,

00:28:52.149 --> 00:28:56.178
He has created you not to hate each other,

00:28:57.011 --> 00:29:01.336
but to know how boundless is His love,

00:29:02.544 --> 00:29:06.630
how eternal is His compassion,

00:29:07.130 --> 00:29:12.967
how great He is and that with what care He has built you up.

00:29:13.155 --> 00:29:15.155
You'll be amazed when you get your Realization

00:29:15.342 --> 00:29:21.411
to see the inner side within you, how it works, how it shows, how it indicates,

00:29:22.057 --> 00:29:26.218
you can make it out, a person supposing when you ask the person,

00:29:26.364 --> 00:29:29.883
this finger is burning you find, you are a realized soul

00:29:30.008 --> 00:29:32.761
and you ask the person, "What about your father?"

00:29:32.865 --> 00:29:34.792
"I have nothing to do with my father now,

00:29:34.834 --> 00:29:37.281
you see, I am very angry with him, this, that.

00:29:37.344 --> 00:29:39.344
This finger is burning, this is the father's finger.

00:29:39.615 --> 00:29:41.973
You have to tell that "You have to forgive your father.

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:45.152
Unless and until you forgive your father, the Kundalini won't rise".

00:29:45.652 --> 00:29:47.652
She has recorded everything about you.

00:29:48.152 --> 00:29:51.316
You have no business to be angry with your father, just forgive.

00:29:51.816 --> 00:29:53.443
Then the Kundalini rises.

00:29:53.943 --> 00:29:57.713
Now, we say Lord's Prayer. Why? For what?

00:29:58.796 --> 00:30:01.525
What is Lord's Prayer? It is a mantra.

00:30:01.692 --> 00:30:03.692
It is a chanting at this center.

00:30:04.192 --> 00:30:07.313
Without saying Lord's Prayer, if your chakra is caught up,

00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.480
you cannot make the Kundalini rise.

00:30:09.709 --> 00:30:12.553
It's most surprising, how we are made,

00:30:12.761 --> 00:30:16.271
all of us together and how we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:30:16.542 --> 00:30:22.775
It's very surprising, how it acts on us and how it convinces us

00:30:22.983 --> 00:30:27.622
that what we are doing is the way we have to be.

00:30:28.018 --> 00:30:33.646
It's not like any other, so-called God's organization

00:30:33.688 --> 00:30:37.376
where you can pay some money, become members and you are finished there.

00:30:37.439 --> 00:30:41.633
Or you dote upon your guru. Your guru is great and this and that

00:30:41.675 --> 00:30:45.231
nonsense - this is not that. It is you who has to become.

00:30:45.294 --> 00:30:48.579
It is you who has to know. It is your own power.

00:30:48.987 --> 00:30:51.465
And that's what one to understand.

00:30:51.529 --> 00:30:54.096
Of course, you cannot pay for all these nonsensical things,

00:30:54.221 --> 00:30:58.648
I mean, I just don't understand that how you pay for these useless people.

00:30:59.294 --> 00:31:01.077
When you cannot pay for God,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.687
why should you pay these horrible people for anything?

00:31:04.062 --> 00:31:07.032
There is no need to pay, but you do, you do pay them.

00:31:07.532 --> 00:31:09.893
You think that you are purchasing your guru -

00:31:09.997 --> 00:31:12.101
any guru who is accepting such a thing,

00:31:12.247 --> 00:31:16.061
who is purchased, is not a guru but a parasite, he is a regular parasite,

00:31:16.561 --> 00:31:20.425
nothing but a parasite. There are many parasites out now.

00:31:20.529 --> 00:31:23.520
Because you are so simple. You are naive in a way

00:31:23.666 --> 00:31:28.160
that you don't understand a person who belongs to God only gives.

00:31:29.452 --> 00:31:32.637
He cannot take. He cannot take anything.

00:31:33.595 --> 00:31:36.950
Even if you give one thing, He will give you ten things

00:31:37.450 --> 00:31:40.594
as a reward of that, so He cannot take.

00:31:40.677 --> 00:31:43.610
And this is what is so simple to understand.

00:31:43.985 --> 00:31:47.263
Everything is extremely simple, but human beings have become rather

00:31:47.346 --> 00:31:51.531
complicated and those complications definitely create a problem

00:31:51.635 --> 00:31:54.619
for the Kundalini awakening, no doubt. But doesn't matter.

00:31:54.702 --> 00:31:58.285
Whatever may be the complications, we know all the tricks now.

00:31:58.535 --> 00:32:00.535
All the permutations and combinations

00:32:00.764 --> 00:32:03.077
and I am sure, we will be able to work it out.

00:32:03.577 --> 00:32:06.467
Thank you very much. I would like you to ask Me some questions

00:32:06.530 --> 00:32:11.512
before we go further with this. May God bless you all.
