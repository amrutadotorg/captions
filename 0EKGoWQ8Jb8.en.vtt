00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:27.649
[Music]

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:36.199
do you have a guru and at what stage did

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.059
you receive self-realization and I don't

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:40.360
have a guru lot I want you to have a loo

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.100
you better become your own girls

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.530
secondly I've been born like that I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.839
never got any realization or anything I

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.300
just got realization I should say human

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:52.339
realization when I understood what was

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.260
the problem with human beings I worked

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:56.899
on the old permutations and combinations

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.059
of human beings because I wanted to have

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:00.829
an our mass media by which I could give

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.320
realization to thousands of people

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:06.729
because any discovery which is made and

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:12.110
it's not brought to that level it is

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:15.710
absolutely detrimental to the growth for

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.800
example you see Jesus was crucified why

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.820
because he was alone only for his mother

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.440
nobody knew what he was at that time he

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.539
could not achieve this because you all

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:32.030
were not there at that time and also

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:33.890
other people you know how the Saints

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.039
have suffered and how every prophet has

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.280
suffered because they could not create a

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:43.459
mass understanding of it so at a certain

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.560
point it has to become a master in the

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:49.039
Tree of Life there are only three or

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.140
four flowers in the beginning but when

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.200
it grows when the Blossom time comes

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:59.330
then so many flowers are there and they

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:01.190
become the fruits so I I just saw that

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.349
this is the time I have to do this job

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.020
so you would call it my human

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:08.599
realization when I understood human

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.520
beings of course even now sometimes I

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:13.430
get shocked the way they behave I mean I

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:18.770
just don't understand but I think now I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:21.560
understand that for those people who

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.640
can't quite understand that answer don't

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:27.830
think about it mother has to be somebody

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.930
special but find out for yourself that's

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.590
the best way you don't worry about me

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:33.590
you are

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.390
to yourself I must be someone alright

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:46.099
even if I'm not doesn't matter if you

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:46.790
are going to get it why not have it need

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.250
to love you

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:57.370
okay let's first learn about Kundalini

00:02:51.250 --> 00:03:00.709
basic many years ago part of what I

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.790
understood was that we please don't

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.900
leave me you talked about raising it

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.290
spontaneously yeah and what I had

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:12.410
understood was that you must always have

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.840
a master to help you raise it that

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.630
somewhere it isn't safe I mean

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.170
psychologically or emotionally to raise

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.330
it yourself that you need the master you

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.849
should guide you yes so I wanted to ask

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.739
about the phrasing of it but she's

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.420
asking me if that she's read that you

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.730
have to have a master nor do you have to

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:33.709
have a master no doubt meaning the

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.500
person who is an enlightened soul a

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:38.600
person was a realized soul can only do I

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.730
wish you knew how to do it he would have

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:43.100
done it himself so you have to have a

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.500
master who is called as a sudden the one

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.250
who has achieved the truth and who is a

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.400
fast

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:52.549
now I'm not a master thank God I am NOT

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:55.519
a master at all I am a mother and mother

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.430
is always a master in a way so that's

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.090
what it is but as far as I am concerned

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:06.370
I am too stopped to be a master writing

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:08.980
because I cannot be hard

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:30.520
that's what so you have to have a master

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:33.190
but to get a master rather or why has

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:38.229
that been over time in history to say

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:41.380
Abraham in nurses see first we have to

00:04:38.229 --> 00:04:43.030
build up the Father root you see out of

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:48.370
fear because without fear

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:50.740
human beings won't listen imagine at the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:52.450
time of Moses the Ten Commandments that

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.610
he brought had to be changed the people

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.530
were so for it

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.419
he had to make them very very strict at

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:00.700
that time you can see from the books

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:02.289
that he seen so you have got the food

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.550
you get the fool ideas - how terrible

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:09.970
the people we're now then we had to talk

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:14.080
of Christ because he had to cross the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:16.300
argument he had to cross it because that

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:18.789
was the problem that time the ego was

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:21.729
too much she imagined at the time of

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.190
Romans how they were already - so he had

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:26.110
to do that joke now today we have

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:28.599
reached at a point fact doubt absolutely

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.180
fed up offer me who super-heroes

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.819
everything now the only the mother can

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:36.249
help

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:38.830
so it has to be at different various

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:42.120
levels of your awareness one had to work

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:45.699
out now is the time of mother to nourish

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:48.189
his mother to give you that love because

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:52.779
you won't be spoiled by anymore that you

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:56.580
understand the authority with which

00:05:52.779 --> 00:06:00.370
Moses stopped authority with which

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:08.979
Socrates stopped authority with which

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:20.770
loud say talked all these great are the

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:23.469
gurus from Adi not to Sai not they

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:27.849
didn't say if you do this way will be

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:38.349
good or that way would be good no this

00:06:27.849 --> 00:06:40.949
is what it is you better do it this is

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:40.949
what these

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:57.350
but in modern times those gurus may not

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:57.350
work out that's why a mother had to come

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:09.450
first to give you realization because

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.280
these gurus did not realize another

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:18.780
point that their disciples not

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:23.280
understand them at all whatever they are

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:29.970
doing they are doing out of all but or

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:36.240
doesn't have understanding in it or even

00:07:29.970 --> 00:07:38.400
the earlier ones may have had the

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:44.970
generation that came afterwards did not

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:48.330
have so they turned the gurus into a

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:54.270
facade and the whole building they owned

00:07:48.330 --> 00:07:58.230
as their own creating all kinds of

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:03.030
problems filling the universality and

00:07:58.230 --> 00:08:13.500
the collectivity because brahma tattwa

00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:19.400
is the power of the collectivity is in

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:24.660
everything in the atom in the molecule

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:29.010
in the human heart everywhere it is

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:31.850
reflected depending on the reflector and

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:31.850
it controls

00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:49.060
this understanding they had but the

00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:51.850
human understanding perhaps they did not

00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.130
have that if he today tell them

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:56.709
something they might listen to us but

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:58.540
tomorrow they will forget so it was

00:08:56.709 --> 00:09:03.580
necessary that you all should be given

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:09.610
realization otherwise also without

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:12.670
realization what's the use was this of

00:09:09.610 --> 00:09:17.110
talking to people about the colors those

00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:20.320
who don't have eyes so realization has

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:23.260
to be you so the first and foremost

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:26.589
thing we have to know that this Hodja

00:09:23.260 --> 00:09:31.270
yoga has worked out because param

00:09:26.589 --> 00:09:35.140
Chaitanya is transmitting compassion it

00:09:31.270 --> 00:09:38.950
never did before never had that kind of

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:43.600
an attitude which it is there because I

00:09:38.950 --> 00:09:45.610
am a mother and this compassion has

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.850
worked it this way that you all have got

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:50.770
your realization you have achieved a

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:56.890
state which we can call as a

00:09:50.770 --> 00:10:01.500
self-realized Souls but still because

00:09:56.890 --> 00:10:05.579
you got it so easily cheaply I think

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:11.010
still we don't realize what we have got

00:10:05.579 --> 00:10:17.200
still we do not practice meditation

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:20.470
introspection and dedication some are

00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:23.140
very much there many people tell me

00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:26.470
mother people had to do so much to go to

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:28.959
Himalayas do these do that and then they

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:30.910
got their realization how is it these

00:10:28.959 --> 00:10:34.660
people who are blessed even with some

00:10:30.910 --> 00:10:38.050
great Saints asked with that what right

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:40.600
there to get this realization why did

00:10:38.050 --> 00:10:44.170
you give this realization what have they

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:46.029
achieved I said only their desire their

00:10:44.170 --> 00:10:48.670
desire was very much there that they

00:10:46.029 --> 00:10:54.750
should get their realization and that's

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:54.750
how they got it but now to go

00:10:55.269 --> 00:11:03.980
into only desire is not sufficient you

00:11:00.410 --> 00:11:05.750
have to depend on yourself on the light

00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:14.420
of your spirit you should see what's

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:21.310
wrong I am supposed to be your guru but

00:11:14.420 --> 00:11:27.579
I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:27.579
is very different from mine

00:11:28.899 --> 00:11:40.089
normally a guru is a very very strict

00:11:32.750 --> 00:11:40.089
person and has no patience of anything

00:11:40.839 --> 00:11:52.959
so there are two three types of tests

00:11:46.699 --> 00:12:03.050
are all the time taken after disciple

00:11:52.959 --> 00:12:08.870
firstly how much they obey but as you

00:12:03.050 --> 00:12:14.440
all have got realization and you are

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:17.440
your own gurus I don't put that

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.440
conditionally

00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:30.080
I leave it to your freedom I tell you

00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:42.860
our Leslie in all the way possible what

00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:44.600
I think good for but I don't compel like

00:12:42.860 --> 00:12:49.820
these gurus used to do I mean they used

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:57.410
to beat they used to hang them on the

00:12:49.820 --> 00:12:58.850
well they were so very strict with their

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:05.209
disciples and I have had an experience

00:12:58.850 --> 00:13:10.910
of this they never used to smile no

00:13:05.209 --> 00:13:17.000
question of laughing and would never

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:22.010
show any kind of weakness of kindness

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:25.520
for the disciples see a guru has to be a

00:13:22.010 --> 00:13:27.709
very angry person wearing only single

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:34.370
dress either upwards or downwards I

00:13:27.709 --> 00:13:40.220
don't know however with a big thick rod

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:44.480
in the hand never spoiling laughing no

00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:48.380
question smiling and the Guru's have to

00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:58.459
be very long fist developing big big

00:13:48.380 --> 00:14:02.810
bears and no ladies allowed in such a

00:13:58.459 --> 00:14:06.050
situation where the women are not to be

00:14:02.810 --> 00:14:09.520
seen at all I mean I shouldn't see will

00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:09.520
see my face it's like that

00:14:13.570 --> 00:14:20.990
there is a big discussion in all the

00:14:18.589 --> 00:14:24.920
scriptures anat scriptures outside the

00:14:20.990 --> 00:14:31.430
critics whether a woman should be

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:34.480
allowed to do the spiritual practices or

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:34.480
not imaginable

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:42.070
not only among Christians will be

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:45.110
surprised even in Indian scriptures

00:14:42.070 --> 00:14:50.600
whether is women should be allowed or

00:14:45.110 --> 00:14:55.310
not to do spiritual practices now when

00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:59.690
your mother is a woman and she is yo

00:14:55.310 --> 00:15:07.579
guru what will you do this is another

00:14:59.690 --> 00:15:11.990
confusion because it is wrong the whole

00:15:07.579 --> 00:15:18.500
thing is falsehood based or no basis at

00:15:11.990 --> 00:15:26.769
all you may try anything to say that

00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:26.769
women are not meant for spiritual life

00:15:27.130 --> 00:15:39.980
try any argument it fails the whole

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:43.519
thing has to be brought up this way that

00:15:39.980 --> 00:15:50.449
everything faces reality all these false

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:51.829
ideas have to be given up like if you

00:15:50.449 --> 00:15:54.800
have a carpet upside down the whole

00:15:51.829 --> 00:15:57.380
design is upside down but if you put the

00:15:54.800 --> 00:16:02.899
carpet right everything falls in line

00:15:57.380 --> 00:16:05.480
and that's why you needed a mother to

00:16:02.899 --> 00:16:10.459
give you realization and a guru as a

00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:17.149
mother to teach me that for ascent of

00:16:10.459 --> 00:16:20.600
God nobody can be provided sahaja yoga

00:16:17.149 --> 00:16:22.250
is not a military thing it's just

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:30.630
playing

00:16:22.250 --> 00:16:34.500
simple mother slaw and of course every

00:16:30.630 --> 00:16:36.870
mother wants her child to be great to

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:41.930
have all her powers she wants her no

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:47.959
doubt how she does it

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:52.230
how she works it out is her own problem

00:16:47.959 --> 00:16:53.490
but how you take it and how you use it

00:16:52.230 --> 00:16:57.959
is your own problem

00:16:53.490 --> 00:17:00.240
I always bow to you people who have got

00:16:57.959 --> 00:17:02.240
realization because I think so many

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:06.890
saints we're never there on this earth

00:17:02.240 --> 00:17:11.040
but the saintliness has to be complete

00:17:06.890 --> 00:17:14.760
without that you cannot help even your

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:20.970
family leave alone your country and no

00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:25.770
question of the whole world so what is

00:17:20.970 --> 00:17:29.340
needed now is to raise your awakening to

00:17:25.770 --> 00:17:34.490
raise your spirituality to go into a

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:38.670
realm of complete support and surrender

00:17:34.490 --> 00:17:47.980
to the movement of the spontaneous

00:17:38.670 --> 00:17:55.060
movement of Salva may God bless you

00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:58.810
[Music]

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:58.810

00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:34.299
