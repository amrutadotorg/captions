00:00.380 --> 00:27.649
[Music]

00:30.310 --> 00:36.199
do you have a guru and at what stage did

00:33.530 --> 00:38.059
you receive self-realization and I don't

00:36.199 --> 00:40.360
have a guru lot I want you to have a loo

00:38.059 --> 00:43.100
you better become your own girls

00:40.360 --> 00:45.530
secondly I've been born like that I

00:43.100 --> 00:47.839
never got any realization or anything I

00:45.530 --> 00:50.300
just got realization I should say human

00:47.839 --> 00:52.339
realization when I understood what was

00:50.300 --> 00:54.260
the problem with human beings I worked

00:52.339 --> 00:56.899
on the old permutations and combinations

00:54.260 --> 00:59.059
of human beings because I wanted to have

00:56.899 --> 01:00.829
an our mass media by which I could give

00:59.059 --> 01:03.320
realization to thousands of people

01:00.829 --> 01:06.729
because any discovery which is made and

01:03.320 --> 01:12.110
it's not brought to that level it is

01:06.729 --> 01:15.710
absolutely detrimental to the growth for

01:12.110 --> 01:18.800
example you see Jesus was crucified why

01:15.710 --> 01:22.820
because he was alone only for his mother

01:18.800 --> 01:24.440
nobody knew what he was at that time he

01:22.820 --> 01:28.539
could not achieve this because you all

01:24.440 --> 01:32.030
were not there at that time and also

01:28.539 --> 01:33.890
other people you know how the Saints

01:32.030 --> 01:37.039
have suffered and how every prophet has

01:33.890 --> 01:40.280
suffered because they could not create a

01:37.039 --> 01:43.459
mass understanding of it so at a certain

01:40.280 --> 01:45.560
point it has to become a master in the

01:43.459 --> 01:49.039
Tree of Life there are only three or

01:45.560 --> 01:51.140
four flowers in the beginning but when

01:49.039 --> 01:54.200
it grows when the Blossom time comes

01:51.140 --> 01:59.330
then so many flowers are there and they

01:54.200 --> 02:01.190
become the fruits so I I just saw that

01:59.330 --> 02:03.349
this is the time I have to do this job

02:01.190 --> 02:06.020
so you would call it my human

02:03.349 --> 02:08.599
realization when I understood human

02:06.020 --> 02:10.520
beings of course even now sometimes I

02:08.599 --> 02:13.430
get shocked the way they behave I mean I

02:10.520 --> 02:18.770
just don't understand but I think now I

02:13.430 --> 02:21.560
understand that for those people who

02:18.770 --> 02:25.640
can't quite understand that answer don't

02:21.560 --> 02:27.830
think about it mother has to be somebody

02:25.640 --> 02:29.930
special but find out for yourself that's

02:27.830 --> 02:30.590
the best way you don't worry about me

02:29.930 --> 02:33.590
you are

02:30.590 --> 02:35.390
to yourself I must be someone alright

02:33.590 --> 02:46.099
even if I'm not doesn't matter if you

02:35.390 --> 02:46.790
are going to get it why not have it need

02:46.099 --> 02:51.250
to love you

02:46.790 --> 02:57.370
okay let's first learn about Kundalini

02:51.250 --> 03:00.709
basic many years ago part of what I

02:57.370 --> 03:03.790
understood was that we please don't

03:00.709 --> 03:05.900
leave me you talked about raising it

03:03.790 --> 03:09.290
spontaneously yeah and what I had

03:05.900 --> 03:12.410
understood was that you must always have

03:09.290 --> 03:14.840
a master to help you raise it that

03:12.410 --> 03:17.630
somewhere it isn't safe I mean

03:14.840 --> 03:21.170
psychologically or emotionally to raise

03:17.630 --> 03:23.330
it yourself that you need the master you

03:21.170 --> 03:25.849
should guide you yes so I wanted to ask

03:23.330 --> 03:27.739
about the phrasing of it but she's

03:25.849 --> 03:29.420
asking me if that she's read that you

03:27.739 --> 03:31.730
have to have a master nor do you have to

03:29.420 --> 03:33.709
have a master no doubt meaning the

03:31.730 --> 03:36.500
person who is an enlightened soul a

03:33.709 --> 03:38.600
person was a realized soul can only do I

03:36.500 --> 03:40.730
wish you knew how to do it he would have

03:38.600 --> 03:43.100
done it himself so you have to have a

03:40.730 --> 03:45.500
master who is called as a sudden the one

03:43.100 --> 03:46.250
who has achieved the truth and who is a

03:45.500 --> 03:49.400
fast

03:46.250 --> 03:52.549
now I'm not a master thank God I am NOT

03:49.400 --> 03:55.519
a master at all I am a mother and mother

03:52.549 --> 03:58.430
is always a master in a way so that's

03:55.519 --> 04:02.090
what it is but as far as I am concerned

03:58.430 --> 04:06.370
I am too stopped to be a master writing

04:02.090 --> 04:08.980
because I cannot be hard

04:06.370 --> 04:30.520
that's what so you have to have a master

04:08.980 --> 04:33.190
but to get a master rather or why has

04:30.520 --> 04:38.229
that been over time in history to say

04:33.190 --> 04:41.380
Abraham in nurses see first we have to

04:38.229 --> 04:43.030
build up the Father root you see out of

04:41.380 --> 04:48.370
fear because without fear

04:43.030 --> 04:50.740
human beings won't listen imagine at the

04:48.370 --> 04:52.450
time of Moses the Ten Commandments that

04:50.740 --> 04:53.610
he brought had to be changed the people

04:52.450 --> 04:56.530
were so for it

04:53.610 --> 04:58.419
he had to make them very very strict at

04:56.530 --> 05:00.700
that time you can see from the books

04:58.419 --> 05:02.289
that he seen so you have got the food

05:00.700 --> 05:06.550
you get the fool ideas - how terrible

05:02.289 --> 05:09.970
the people we're now then we had to talk

05:06.550 --> 05:14.080
of Christ because he had to cross the

05:09.970 --> 05:16.300
argument he had to cross it because that

05:14.080 --> 05:18.789
was the problem that time the ego was

05:16.300 --> 05:21.729
too much she imagined at the time of

05:18.789 --> 05:24.190
Romans how they were already - so he had

05:21.729 --> 05:26.110
to do that joke now today we have

05:24.190 --> 05:28.599
reached at a point fact doubt absolutely

05:26.110 --> 05:31.180
fed up offer me who super-heroes

05:28.599 --> 05:33.819
everything now the only the mother can

05:31.180 --> 05:36.249
help

05:33.819 --> 05:38.830
so it has to be at different various

05:36.249 --> 05:42.120
levels of your awareness one had to work

05:38.830 --> 05:45.699
out now is the time of mother to nourish

05:42.120 --> 05:48.189
his mother to give you that love because

05:45.699 --> 05:52.779
you won't be spoiled by anymore that you

05:48.189 --> 05:56.580
understand the authority with which

05:52.779 --> 06:00.370
Moses stopped authority with which

05:56.580 --> 06:08.979
Socrates stopped authority with which

06:00.370 --> 06:20.770
loud say talked all these great are the

06:08.979 --> 06:23.469
gurus from Adi not to Sai not they

06:20.770 --> 06:27.849
didn't say if you do this way will be

06:23.469 --> 06:38.349
good or that way would be good no this

06:27.849 --> 06:40.949
is what it is you better do it this is

06:38.349 --> 06:40.949
what these

06:44.190 --> 06:57.350
but in modern times those gurus may not

06:49.950 --> 06:57.350
work out that's why a mother had to come

07:00.020 --> 07:09.450
first to give you realization because

07:07.260 --> 07:13.280
these gurus did not realize another

07:09.450 --> 07:18.780
point that their disciples not

07:13.280 --> 07:23.280
understand them at all whatever they are

07:18.780 --> 07:29.970
doing they are doing out of all but or

07:23.280 --> 07:36.240
doesn't have understanding in it or even

07:29.970 --> 07:38.400
the earlier ones may have had the

07:36.240 --> 07:44.970
generation that came afterwards did not

07:38.400 --> 07:48.330
have so they turned the gurus into a

07:44.970 --> 07:54.270
facade and the whole building they owned

07:48.330 --> 07:58.230
as their own creating all kinds of

07:54.270 --> 08:03.030
problems filling the universality and

07:58.230 --> 08:13.500
the collectivity because brahma tattwa

08:03.030 --> 08:19.400
is the power of the collectivity is in

08:13.500 --> 08:24.660
everything in the atom in the molecule

08:19.400 --> 08:29.010
in the human heart everywhere it is

08:24.660 --> 08:31.850
reflected depending on the reflector and

08:29.010 --> 08:31.850
it controls

08:41.080 --> 08:49.060
this understanding they had but the

08:46.420 --> 08:51.850
human understanding perhaps they did not

08:49.060 --> 08:54.130
have that if he today tell them

08:51.850 --> 08:56.709
something they might listen to us but

08:54.130 --> 08:58.540
tomorrow they will forget so it was

08:56.709 --> 09:03.580
necessary that you all should be given

08:58.540 --> 09:09.610
realization otherwise also without

09:03.580 --> 09:12.670
realization what's the use was this of

09:09.610 --> 09:17.110
talking to people about the colors those

09:12.670 --> 09:20.320
who don't have eyes so realization has

09:17.110 --> 09:23.260
to be you so the first and foremost

09:20.320 --> 09:26.589
thing we have to know that this Hodja

09:23.260 --> 09:31.270
yoga has worked out because param

09:26.589 --> 09:35.140
Chaitanya is transmitting compassion it

09:31.270 --> 09:38.950
never did before never had that kind of

09:35.140 --> 09:43.600
an attitude which it is there because I

09:38.950 --> 09:45.610
am a mother and this compassion has

09:43.600 --> 09:48.850
worked it this way that you all have got

09:45.610 --> 09:50.770
your realization you have achieved a

09:48.850 --> 09:56.890
state which we can call as a

09:50.770 --> 10:01.500
self-realized Souls but still because

09:56.890 --> 10:05.579
you got it so easily cheaply I think

10:01.500 --> 10:11.010
still we don't realize what we have got

10:05.579 --> 10:17.200
still we do not practice meditation

10:11.010 --> 10:20.470
introspection and dedication some are

10:17.200 --> 10:23.140
very much there many people tell me

10:20.470 --> 10:26.470
mother people had to do so much to go to

10:23.140 --> 10:28.959
Himalayas do these do that and then they

10:26.470 --> 10:30.910
got their realization how is it these

10:28.959 --> 10:34.660
people who are blessed even with some

10:30.910 --> 10:38.050
great Saints asked with that what right

10:34.660 --> 10:40.600
there to get this realization why did

10:38.050 --> 10:44.170
you give this realization what have they

10:40.600 --> 10:46.029
achieved I said only their desire their

10:44.170 --> 10:48.670
desire was very much there that they

10:46.029 --> 10:54.750
should get their realization and that's

10:48.670 --> 10:54.750
how they got it but now to go

10:55.269 --> 11:03.980
into only desire is not sufficient you

11:00.410 --> 11:05.750
have to depend on yourself on the light

11:03.980 --> 11:14.420
of your spirit you should see what's

11:05.750 --> 11:21.310
wrong I am supposed to be your guru but

11:14.420 --> 11:27.579
I feel sometimes that the idea of a guru

11:21.310 --> 11:27.579
is very different from mine

11:28.899 --> 11:40.089
normally a guru is a very very strict

11:32.750 --> 11:40.089
person and has no patience of anything

11:40.839 --> 11:52.959
so there are two three types of tests

11:46.699 --> 12:03.050
are all the time taken after disciple

11:52.959 --> 12:08.870
firstly how much they obey but as you

12:03.050 --> 12:14.440
all have got realization and you are

12:08.870 --> 12:17.440
your own gurus I don't put that

12:14.440 --> 12:17.440
conditionally

12:18.860 --> 12:30.080
I leave it to your freedom I tell you

12:22.820 --> 12:42.860
our Leslie in all the way possible what

12:30.080 --> 12:44.600
I think good for but I don't compel like

12:42.860 --> 12:49.820
these gurus used to do I mean they used

12:44.600 --> 12:57.410
to beat they used to hang them on the

12:49.820 --> 12:58.850
well they were so very strict with their

12:57.410 --> 13:05.209
disciples and I have had an experience

12:58.850 --> 13:10.910
of this they never used to smile no

13:05.209 --> 13:17.000
question of laughing and would never

13:10.910 --> 13:22.010
show any kind of weakness of kindness

13:17.000 --> 13:25.520
for the disciples see a guru has to be a

13:22.010 --> 13:27.709
very angry person wearing only single

13:25.520 --> 13:34.370
dress either upwards or downwards I

13:27.709 --> 13:40.220
don't know however with a big thick rod

13:34.370 --> 13:44.480
in the hand never spoiling laughing no

13:40.220 --> 13:48.380
question smiling and the Guru's have to

13:44.480 --> 13:58.459
be very long fist developing big big

13:48.380 --> 14:02.810
bears and no ladies allowed in such a

13:58.459 --> 14:06.050
situation where the women are not to be

14:02.810 --> 14:09.520
seen at all I mean I shouldn't see will

14:06.050 --> 14:09.520
see my face it's like that

14:13.570 --> 14:20.990
there is a big discussion in all the

14:18.589 --> 14:24.920
scriptures anat scriptures outside the

14:20.990 --> 14:31.430
critics whether a woman should be

14:24.920 --> 14:34.480
allowed to do the spiritual practices or

14:31.430 --> 14:34.480
not imaginable

14:35.440 --> 14:42.070
not only among Christians will be

14:38.300 --> 14:45.110
surprised even in Indian scriptures

14:42.070 --> 14:50.600
whether is women should be allowed or

14:45.110 --> 14:55.310
not to do spiritual practices now when

14:50.600 --> 14:59.690
your mother is a woman and she is yo

14:55.310 --> 15:07.579
guru what will you do this is another

14:59.690 --> 15:11.990
confusion because it is wrong the whole

15:07.579 --> 15:18.500
thing is falsehood based or no basis at

15:11.990 --> 15:26.769
all you may try anything to say that

15:18.500 --> 15:26.769
women are not meant for spiritual life

15:27.130 --> 15:39.980
try any argument it fails the whole

15:34.970 --> 15:43.519
thing has to be brought up this way that

15:39.980 --> 15:50.449
everything faces reality all these false

15:43.519 --> 15:51.829
ideas have to be given up like if you

15:50.449 --> 15:54.800
have a carpet upside down the whole

15:51.829 --> 15:57.380
design is upside down but if you put the

15:54.800 --> 16:02.899
carpet right everything falls in line

15:57.380 --> 16:05.480
and that's why you needed a mother to

16:02.899 --> 16:10.459
give you realization and a guru as a

16:05.480 --> 16:17.149
mother to teach me that for ascent of

16:10.459 --> 16:20.600
God nobody can be provided sahaja yoga

16:17.149 --> 16:22.250
is not a military thing it's just

16:20.600 --> 16:30.630
playing

16:22.250 --> 16:34.500
simple mother slaw and of course every

16:30.630 --> 16:36.870
mother wants her child to be great to

16:34.500 --> 16:41.930
have all her powers she wants her no

16:36.870 --> 16:47.959
doubt how she does it

16:41.930 --> 16:52.230
how she works it out is her own problem

16:47.959 --> 16:53.490
but how you take it and how you use it

16:52.230 --> 16:57.959
is your own problem

16:53.490 --> 17:00.240
I always bow to you people who have got

16:57.959 --> 17:02.240
realization because I think so many

17:00.240 --> 17:06.890
saints we're never there on this earth

17:02.240 --> 17:11.040
but the saintliness has to be complete

17:06.890 --> 17:14.760
without that you cannot help even your

17:11.040 --> 17:20.970
family leave alone your country and no

17:14.760 --> 17:25.770
question of the whole world so what is

17:20.970 --> 17:29.340
needed now is to raise your awakening to
