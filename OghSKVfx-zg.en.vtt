00:08.000 --> 00:13.583
Today we are celebrating in Switzerland

00:14.125 --> 00:18.458
the coronation of Shri Rama on Dassera Day.

00:20.542 --> 00:23.500
Many things happened on Dassera Day.

00:23.667 --> 00:25.500
The most important was

00:25.667 --> 00:31.625
that Shri Rama was “coronated”

00:33.291 --> 00:36.625
as a king on this day.

00:40.125 --> 00:47.125
He also killed Ravana on this day.

00:48.625 --> 00:51.875
Many may say that “how can it be He killed Ravana

00:52.041 --> 00:55.583
and He was “coronated” on the same date?”

00:55.792 --> 01:02.542
In those days in India, we had supersonic aeroplanes

01:03.709 --> 01:08.792
and - is a fact, and the aeroplane’s name was Pushpak,

01:09.166 --> 01:11.208
meaning “the flower”.

01:11.417 --> 01:15.583
It was called as Pushpak and it has a tremendous speed.

01:16.000 --> 01:22.000
So after killing Ravana He came to Ayodhya with His wife

01:22.250 --> 01:26.917
and that was the day He was crowned.

01:28.417 --> 01:34.959
On the ninth day, He worshiped the Goddess to get strength,

01:35.417 --> 01:38.500
Shakti, for his weapons,

01:38.834 --> 01:42.999
and the tenth day He killed Ravana.

01:43.875 --> 01:47.333
So, you can imagine how much advanced people were there

01:47.542 --> 01:51.333
at the time of Shri Rama and His kingdom.

01:51.583 --> 01:56.291
The reason was the king was an incarnation;

01:56.542 --> 02:03.000
also He was a benevolent king as described by Socrates.

02:04.834 --> 02:09.375
Shri Rama’s story is very interesting throughout

02:09.625 --> 02:14.417
and we have now a beautiful series about Him

02:14.667 --> 02:21.667
done by our television in India, which is sold for a very good price,

02:21.875 --> 02:28.250
maybe we might be able to present you all with one, when you come there.

02:28.709 --> 02:35.792
But the story of Rama they say was written before He was born.

02:37.250 --> 02:44.208
Even before there was any inkling of it;

02:44.792 --> 02:51.041
The seer, Valmiki, wrote the whole story of Shri Rama.

02:51.834 --> 02:55.291
Shri Rama’s birth and all that

02:55.458 --> 03:02.458
are brought forth by the Agni, the fire,

03:03.625 --> 03:10.667
and He was born in the Dynasty of the Surya, is the sun.

03:12.166 --> 03:14.542
So with all that,

03:14.959 --> 03:20.250
born out of the blessings of the Agni, that is fire,

03:20.417 --> 03:27.458
and also was born in the dynasty of Surya,

03:28.166 --> 03:35.166
He was one of the mildest avataras you have ever had.

03:36.083 --> 03:40.917
He’s known to be a very

03:45.834 --> 03:47.166
I mean English language

03:47.417 --> 03:50.667
formal person, in the sense

03:50.834 --> 03:57.750
sankoch - that He would go to any extent

03:58.792 --> 04:05.875
to bear upon Himself the problems than to tell others to do something.

04:07.000 --> 04:10.417
We still had many people in India like that.

04:10.750 --> 04:14.667
Like we had one prime minister, Lal Bahadur Shastri,

04:15.041 --> 04:16.959
and

04:17.750 --> 04:21.250
if he was sitting in the room and there are people sitting

04:21.458 --> 04:26.125
and there’s electricity was on somehow,

04:26.375 --> 04:29.959
say by light or something, and he wants to put it off,

04:30.125 --> 04:32.917
he would not ask anyone to put it off.

04:33.083 --> 04:36.333
Slowly he’ll get up from his seat,

04:36.583 --> 04:40.083
walk up to the switch and just put it off

04:40.333 --> 04:43.000
so that he shouldn’t ask for anything.

04:43.208 --> 04:47.000
This is one of the greatest quality of Shri Rama

04:47.250 --> 04:52.291
that He would not make anyone do anything for Him

04:52.500 --> 04:57.999
or order anything or would use someone for that purpose.

04:58.291 --> 05:03.875
See, He was the blessing of fire

05:04.291 --> 05:06.667
and born in the Surya.

05:06.917 --> 05:11.500
But what we find, those people who are born,

05:11.750 --> 05:15.625
maybe in very lowly families,

05:15.834 --> 05:19.542
in the negative families, the left-sided as you can call it,

05:19.750 --> 05:21.999
with all kinds of problems,

05:22.166 --> 05:28.834
have a terrible Agnya and a terrible Suryada in them.

05:29.917 --> 05:35.542
The person who is born in the Surya has to be extremely humble.

05:35.750 --> 05:41.417
He is the one who shows that nothing can affect him,

05:41.667 --> 05:47.500
nothing can make him feel that he is something great.

05:48.125 --> 05:52.291
Now, when we see His life further,

05:53.083 --> 05:55.166
He was a very humble man.

05:55.375 --> 06:02.000
We've seen now people who try to despise others,

06:02.375 --> 06:05.333
“I don’t like you”, “I don’t like”,

06:05.542 --> 06:08.875
“It’s not good”, “It’s very difficult”,

06:09.041 --> 06:15.834
is a sign that such a person is extremely low in character,

06:16.750 --> 06:20.500
has no character at all but is low in character.

06:20.709 --> 06:24.500
Anybody who has any character is shown

06:24.709 --> 06:29.208
by the tolerance he has of other people.

06:29.999 --> 06:37.208
Intolerance is a sign of a person who is extremely egoistical

06:37.458 --> 06:42.542
and has,  is vain, there’s vanity.

06:43.041 --> 06:50.500
Shri Rama was so much loved by the people where He ruled in that state

06:50.999 --> 06:54.959
and He had the most beautiful wife

06:55.125 --> 07:00.750
of the most venerated father, Janaka,

07:00.959 --> 07:05.709
and who was the beloved son of His father.

07:05.917 --> 07:10.166
But He was such an humble man, such an humble man,

07:10.375 --> 07:14.333
that in all His character you see the beauty.

07:14.542 --> 07:19.625
Like, He was going by a little boat

07:19.834 --> 07:24.250
when He went for His exile.

07:24.458 --> 07:29.999
And the one who was taking Him was an ordinary boatman.

07:30.250 --> 07:35.208
And the boatman was feeling very much upset

07:35.417 --> 07:38.417
that he’s sitting before the king of Ayodhya

07:38.625 --> 07:41.041
and he doesn’t have proper clothes.

07:41.291 --> 07:47.125
So Shri Rama, who was Himself was wearing nothing but

07:48.125 --> 07:53.333
valkalas - are the clothes which are worn by the village people

07:53.542 --> 07:58.500
or worn by the people who live in the primitive areas,

07:58.709 --> 08:04.000
only kind of leaves that they have.

08:04.208 --> 08:07.709
He had to wear that because His mother, the stepmother,

08:07.917 --> 08:11.792
asked for that kind of boon from the father.

08:12.208 --> 08:16.333
And then Shri Rama just told him,

08:16.583 --> 08:20.834
“Why are you worried? I am wearing this. I am no more a king.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.917
I am sitting before you like this. You should be quite comforted.

08:25.083 --> 08:29.166
And I really don’t know how to steer the boat

08:29.417 --> 08:33.333
while you know how to steer the boat so why should you be worried?”

08:33.542 --> 08:38.041
Like that He kept even the people

08:38.250 --> 08:42.875
who we would call as low in society

08:43.041 --> 08:49.875
at a very high pedestal, which shows that He respected human beings.

08:50.083 --> 08:53.709
He Himself is called as maryada purushottama,

08:53.917 --> 08:57.083
means He was the one who had to knew

08:57.333 --> 09:00.959
how far to go with someone, maryada

09:01.125 --> 09:05.709
How to talk to someone, how to approach someone,

09:05.917 --> 09:10.083
while we find people who misbehave,

09:10.291 --> 09:13.083
even with their husbands, with their wives, with their children,

09:13.291 --> 09:19.792
with everyone and also outside they are about to jump on others.

09:20.208 --> 09:24.041
That’s absolutely against Rama.  It’s like Ravana.

09:24.250 --> 09:27.458
Even Ravana was not like this.

09:28.417 --> 09:30.999
He was also of not that nature

09:31.208 --> 09:34.792
because he had certain dharmas within him. He was a realized soul,

09:34.999 --> 09:40.625
but he had become a rakshasa because he became arrogant,

09:40.834 --> 09:43.667
but even his arrogance cannot be matched

09:43.875 --> 09:49.333
with many modern people and modern girls and men that I hear and see,

09:49.583 --> 09:53.375
that it is surprising they have really surpassed Ravana.

09:53.583 --> 09:57.166
Ravana only had ten heads but sometimes I feel

09:57.375 --> 10:01.166
that the modern men might have, or the women specially,

10:01.375 --> 10:06.041
might have hundred and eight heads!

10:07.583 --> 10:14.083
The arrogance, the amount of expression of hatred,

10:14.375 --> 10:19.709
is so ridiculous and makes a person look so useless,

10:19.917 --> 10:22.667
but I see such people very common

10:22.875 --> 10:27.709
and in Sahaja Yoga also they crawl somehow.

10:30.792 --> 10:37.083
Actually such people are absolutely despised by God Almighty.

10:38.166 --> 10:41.999
You go further with His life, see He went

10:42.166 --> 10:47.625
and into the village where a very old woman

10:47.834 --> 10:51.333
who was belonging to the primitive class of Bhils, (िभल –tribe living in the jungles of central India)

10:51.792 --> 10:57.999
had very few teeth, and she brought some

10:59.375 --> 11:02.875
some fruits, little fruits we call as ber,

11:03.041 --> 11:05.417
and she brought and gave it to Him,

11:05.625 --> 11:10.083
that “Shri Ram, you see, I have got these for you.

11:10.333 --> 11:14.250
I don’t have anything else. And these, I’ve tested all of them.”

11:14.458 --> 11:17.583
Actually in India, if you put in the mouth, it is uttishtha,

11:17.792 --> 11:19.875
nobody will touch it.

11:20.041 --> 11:24.792
But she says, “I have tasted all of them by piercing my teeth into it

11:24.999 --> 11:27.667
and I have seen that none of them are sour.”

11:27.917 --> 11:31.333
Shri Rama didn’t like sour fruits, she knew,

11:31.792 --> 11:35.041
so, “None of them are sour and you can have them.”

11:35.250 --> 11:39.166
I mean, in a way, if it is done to somebody in the west

11:39.375 --> 11:42.083
they will hit you hard.

11:43.291 --> 11:46.041
Immediately Shri Rama rushed forward

11:46.291 --> 11:51.834
and took the bers from her hand,

11:52.041 --> 11:55.542
kissed her hand, said, "All right, all right, I’m going to have them.”

11:55.750 --> 11:58.750
With such enthusiasm He ate them.

11:58.959 --> 12:04.999
So Lakshmana was little angry at that lady, “What’s this going on?”

12:05.166 --> 12:09.000
So Sitaji said, “Oh do you like them very much?”

12:09.208 --> 12:11.250
He said, “Yes, but I’m not going to give you anything.”

12:11.458 --> 12:15.917
She said, “No, I am your half body. You have to give me.”

12:16.083 --> 12:19.291
So He gave some to Sitaji. So Sitaji ate,

12:19.500 --> 12:24.166
“Yaah, what a thing! It’s like nectar of heaven I am eating.”

12:24.375 --> 12:27.500
So Lakshmana felt very jealous.

12:29.500 --> 12:33.166
He said, “Sister-in-law, can I not have a little of it?”

12:33.375 --> 12:36.959
She said, “No. I can’t give you. You ask your brother.

12:37.125 --> 12:39.166
I’m not going to give you. I have a very little share.

12:39.375 --> 12:41.500
Why don’t you ask your brother?”

12:41.709 --> 12:45.250
So he goes to his brother, he says, “Can I have some more?”

12:45.458 --> 12:52.875
So Shri Rama smiled and gave him that ber which was eaten,

12:53.041 --> 12:58.125
or touched, or was pierced, by the teeth of a primitive woman,

12:58.375 --> 13:04.959
who is actually an outcast according to the Brahminic laws of India.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.959
The sweetness of Shri Rama,

13:11.709 --> 13:16.999
the way He used to make people feel comfortable,

13:18.166 --> 13:23.667
like I would say, an example of a oyster

13:23.875 --> 13:30.875
who gets a little stone into the body of the shell,

13:32.208 --> 13:37.500
takes out a kind of a shiny liquid

13:37.709 --> 13:40.959
and covers it with that shiny liquid

13:41.125 --> 13:45.959
and makes it into a pearl to be comfortable.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.041
Now, He didn’t want His own comfort.

13:51.291 --> 13:54.375
Rama is a little bit different

13:54.583 --> 14:01.792
that He wanted to make everyone into a diamond, or a pearl,

14:02.000 --> 14:07.999
so that the other person would shine and would look nice,

14:08.208 --> 14:11.250
and that’s how He felt comforted.

14:12.291 --> 14:17.834
His qualities, if you have to imbibe, first of all

14:18.041 --> 14:23.875
we have to understand the innate situation of Shri Rama.

14:24.959 --> 14:31.375
Shri Rama is placed on the right-hand side of your heart,

14:33.208 --> 14:37.999
right hand side, right heart, He’s placed there.

14:38.542 --> 14:42.166
Now in a human being there is no right heart.

14:43.166 --> 14:44.959
If you tell somebody there's right heart, they’ll say, “What,

14:45.125 --> 14:47.875
there are two hearts, or three hearts?”

14:48.166 --> 14:53.417
In our Sahaja Yoga we have three hearts:

14:54.709 --> 14:58.709
one is the left, another is the right, and one is the center.

14:58.917 --> 15:03.667
Now the right heart is a very important thing.

15:04.333 --> 15:11.041
The right heart looks after the whole

15:11.625 --> 15:14.625
lungs, both the lungs,

15:15.208 --> 15:18.542
all the throat,

15:18.750 --> 15:24.750
the trachea, the nose, the inner part.

15:25.166 --> 15:28.125
The outer side is looked after, we can say,

15:28.333 --> 15:30.875
the features are given by Shri Krishna

15:31.041 --> 15:34.834
but the inner part of it is all done by Shri Rama.

15:35.041 --> 15:39.792
They are the same, but one acts as an inner part,

15:39.999 --> 15:43.542
another as the outer part.

15:43.750 --> 15:48.333
It gives you the ears, from the inner part, Shri Rama does.

15:48.959 --> 15:53.625
He gives you the eyes, in the inner part of the eyes.

15:53.959 --> 15:58.750
Now, it’s so important to have the inner side all right

15:58.959 --> 16:03.375
than the outer side. Is an example of Shri Rama,

16:03.583 --> 16:10.083
He never cared for the outer side or the outward looks of a person.

16:11.542 --> 16:14.709
Because He came before Shri Krishna,

16:14.917 --> 16:18.999
He tried to build up the inner side of a human being.

16:19.208 --> 16:22.083
So, we can say, though He is on the right heart,

16:22.291 --> 16:25.083
He acts through your Hamsa chakra

16:25.291 --> 16:30.083
and partly through your Vishuddhi Chakra in the inner side of it.

16:30.291 --> 16:34.583
Because Shri Krishna, in the inner side of it is Shri Rama,

16:34.999 --> 16:38.083
is Shri Vishnu.

16:38.667 --> 16:42.166
So, when somebody is,

16:43.041 --> 16:46.834
say, not good looking according to the western standard,

16:46.999 --> 16:51.625
according to Me the western standards are rather funny,

16:52.999 --> 16:56.291
because western standards don’t look like

16:56.500 --> 17:00.083
neither like Krishna or Shri Rama.

17:01.667 --> 17:08.667
The person like Shri Rama was a very healthy, tall person

17:08.875 --> 17:12.917
with his hands up to the knees,

17:13.083 --> 17:17.875
ajanubahu, means the one who has ajanubahu,

17:18.625 --> 17:23.166
and He was plump, both of them were plump.

17:23.417 --> 17:26.083
They had to be plump people, because they were

17:26.291 --> 17:30.583
though they were born of the Agni, He was born of the Agni,

17:30.792 --> 17:37.333
but the water is the main element of Shri Vishnu.

17:37.875 --> 17:39.875
So they were all plump people.

17:40.041 --> 17:43.834
They were not thin like sticks as today’s modern ideas are,

17:44.000 --> 17:47.999
to be thin like sticks and like TB-patients.

17:48.166 --> 17:53.041
But it doesn’t mean all plump people are good.

17:53.417 --> 17:56.458
We always logically think that plump people are,

17:56.667 --> 17:59.375
if  Mother says so, then plump people are good. Is not the point.

17:59.583 --> 18:02.166
The inner side of it I am saying.

18:02.375 --> 18:06.417
The inner side of it is just the opposite.

18:06.625 --> 18:11.250
Inner side of it is absolutely beautiful

18:11.458 --> 18:18.166
and absolutely full of love, affection and warmth.

18:18.625 --> 18:21.959
A person who doesn’t have these things

18:22.125 --> 18:27.125
is a sign of a person who is not a Sahaja Yogi, first of all.

18:27.709 --> 18:30.375
A person who is very loud,

18:30.917 --> 18:35.750
talks loudly, speaks loudly, laughs at wrong places

18:36.083 --> 18:39.999
must be half mad but cannot be a Sahaja Yogi.

18:41.417 --> 18:45.875
See this softness of Shri Rama goes to the extremes

18:46.041 --> 18:49.125
where I call the sankocha, the formality, 'the formal'

18:49.333 --> 18:53.959
but it is English language, “formal” is not the word, sankoch.

18:54.125 --> 18:56.667
He was once

18:59.959 --> 19:03.792
when He was fighting Ravana,

19:03.999 --> 19:10.834
He was taking out with His arrow his ten heads one after another.

19:10.999 --> 19:14.917
And if He took out one then took out the second,

19:15.083 --> 19:19.542
the first one would come back so because he had a kind of a blessing

19:19.750 --> 19:24.583
that nobody can kill him by hitting him on his head.

19:24.917 --> 19:27.375
So Lakshmana says, “You know for definite

19:27.667 --> 19:32.500
that this Ravana cannot be killed by hitting on his head,

19:32.709 --> 19:35.834
so why don’t You hit him in his heart?”

19:35.999 --> 19:38.667
So He said, “The reason is this,

19:38.917 --> 19:45.750
that just now in his heart is Mahalakshmi, the Sita.

19:45.959 --> 19:50.834
Sita is sitting in his heart. And how can I hit him on his heart?

19:51.000 --> 19:54.333
Because She’s there,  She might be hurt.”

19:54.917 --> 19:57.500
“So what’s the use of hitting on the head?” he said.

19:57.709 --> 20:00.792
He said, “Because, once I start hitting him on the head fast,

20:00.999 --> 20:02.333
his attention will go there.

20:02.542 --> 20:05.125
As soon as his attention will go into his head

20:05.333 --> 20:08.166
then I can hit him on his heart.”

20:08.959 --> 20:11.959
See the sankoch?

20:14.333 --> 20:18.333
See the sankoch, the way He talked.

20:20.250 --> 20:23.375
Now we have - Tina, what is wrong with you?

20:23.625 --> 20:28.166
Why are you all the time smiling like this. Can't you keep quiet?

20:28.959 --> 20:31.375
What is there to smile, about certain things,

20:31.583 --> 20:35.417
where you don't have to smile?  Keep quiet!

20:35.750 --> 20:40.709
Now, then what happened, that He was

20:44.667 --> 20:49.417
so kind once when a very ugly woman, Shurpanakha,

20:49.667 --> 20:54.750
came to entice Him. And she said, she came to entice,

20:54.959 --> 20:58.458
she said that, “Rama why don’t You marry me?”

20:58.667 --> 21:02.166
I mean, to a person like Rama who is maryada Purushottama

21:02.375 --> 21:05.291
to ask such a horrible questions.

21:05.750 --> 21:10.625
Somebody would have really beaten her up if not anything else.

21:10.999 --> 21:14.417
So, Shri Ram smiled. He said,

21:14.667 --> 21:16.333
“Madam, I’m sorry.

21:16.542 --> 21:23.125
I have a wife and I believe in one wife, 'ekapatnivrat'.

21:23.417 --> 21:25.417
So I’m sorry I can’t marry you.”

21:25.625 --> 21:28.917
But mischievously He says, “All right, My brother is there.

21:29.083 --> 21:33.625
His wife is left in Ayodhya. You can ask.”

21:35.625 --> 21:39.625
So he went to her and he asked,

21:42.458 --> 21:46.750
She went to him and asked, “Lakshmana why don’t you marry me? ”

21:46.959 --> 21:48.291
She had become very beautiful.

21:48.500 --> 21:51.333
She has transformed herself to a beautiful woman.

21:51.542 --> 21:54.291
She must have gone to some beauty or something,

21:54.500 --> 21:57.875
but she made herself like that, and she was there.

21:58.041 --> 22:02.917
And he looked at her so angry, he said, “You, the ugly,

22:03.083 --> 22:06.667
why do you want to ask such a question?”  He cut her nose.

22:06.917 --> 22:09.000
When he cut her nose, that was in Nasik

22:09.208 --> 22:11.500
and that’s why Nasika means the nose,

22:11.709 --> 22:13.500
and that’s why you have been to Nasik,

22:13.709 --> 22:15.999
that’s the place where he cut her nose.

22:16.166 --> 22:18.917
He was very angry.  But Shri Rama did not.

22:19.083 --> 22:21.250
He said in a way that’s very convincing that,

22:21.458 --> 22:27.208
“See I have a wife and I am a person who believes in My one wife.”

22:27.417 --> 22:31.625
Now the another character about Him was that He was consistent.

22:32.250 --> 22:36.000
He was never inconsistent like Shri Krishna.

22:36.583 --> 22:43.750
Shri Krishna was a diplomat and diplomacy is in being inconsistent.

22:47.709 --> 22:50.999
Shri Krishna’s style was different. But ….

22:51.166 --> 22:54.375
Why?  What is the matter with you?  Why, what is it?

22:54.667 --> 22:56.583
You come ad sit here. This side come along Tina.

22:56.792 --> 23:00.542
Come and sit on the other side. Why do you talk to her?

23:01.208 --> 23:04.208
Go and sit at the back. Go.

23:06.166 --> 23:11.166
She has already given me a very bad time in Puna, and now here she is.

23:13.250 --> 23:15.875
While I am talking, please don't talk to each other.

23:16.041 --> 23:17.709
This is the least you can do to me.

23:17.917 --> 23:21.333
Have you seen any Indians behave like this?

23:31.959 --> 23:34.917
It's very disturbing.

23:35.667 --> 23:39.875
I am concentrating on you why you are not concentrating on Me.

23:40.083 --> 23:42.875
It's alright, when there is a joke, something - you laugh.

23:43.041 --> 23:47.083
What's the need to talk to each other, I can`t understand.

23:51.959 --> 23:54.458
Alright. Sorry I had to say that.

23:54.667 --> 23:58.208
You see at the time, when I am discussing Shri Rama.

23:58.959 --> 24:02.125
Shri Rama would not have said that.

24:03.291 --> 24:07.500
But in Sahaja Yoga, you can’t carry on like Shri Rama.

24:07.750 --> 24:10.999
Sometimes you have to be like Parashurama also,

24:11.166 --> 24:14.333
otherwise things don’t work out.

24:15.583 --> 24:19.917
Now, when it went ahead with it

24:20.083 --> 24:23.041
in His character, which was so beautiful,

24:23.250 --> 24:26.583
that you find He was such a consistent person.

24:27.041 --> 24:33.250
Whatever He said, all the life He carried that. For example, He said,

24:33.458 --> 24:38.166
“I am the one who believes in one wife, aika patni vrat.”

24:39.333 --> 24:46.291
Now He had a very nice wife, no doubt, very beautiful wife,

24:46.500 --> 24:51.417
but She had gone to Ravana and He was left alone.

24:51.625 --> 24:54.834
When they wanted to start a kind of a yagya

24:55.000 --> 24:56.999
called as ‘Rajasurya yagya’

24:57.166 --> 25:04.083
which was meant to be  the conquering the whole world.

25:05.709 --> 25:07.083
Then they asked Him,

25:07.291 --> 25:10.041
“You have to marry, because you have to have your wife.”

25:10.291 --> 25:15.500
He said, “No, I can’t marry, because nobody could be like My wife

25:15.709 --> 25:20.583
and I can’t marry. I can forego this kind of a yagya,

25:20.834 --> 25:23.458
but I can’t marry again.”

25:23.667 --> 25:27.625
So, then they said, “All right, there’s only one thing you can do

25:27.834 --> 25:31.959
is to make a statue of Sita in gold

25:32.125 --> 25:39.125
and you have to use Her, that statue, as a wife representing.”

25:39.625 --> 25:43.917
He said, “That I will agree.” He took away all His ornaments,

25:44.083 --> 25:50.417
everything, and made that statue and He did this yagya.

25:50.667 --> 25:53.959
So whatever He said He followed thoroughly.

25:54.125 --> 25:57.375
In His dharma He was perfect.

25:57.583 --> 26:01.417
Another incident is that when

26:02.375 --> 26:06.250
Sita was lost.

26:06.667 --> 26:11.999
He never slept, He never slept on a bed,

26:12.291 --> 26:14.834
always on the Mother Earth.

26:15.250 --> 26:18.417
Never slept on a bed, always on the Mother Earth.

26:18.667 --> 26:20.709
The pain He had of His wife

26:20.917 --> 26:25.750
is very well described by all the poets of India.

26:26.083 --> 26:30.667
And when Sita left Him ultimately in a very mysterious way,

26:30.917 --> 26:33.709
She just disappeared in the Mother Earth

26:33.917 --> 26:35.834
because Mother Earth had given Her birth

26:36.000 --> 26:37.999
so She disappeared into Mother Earth.

26:38.166 --> 26:43.458
Then Shri Rama became absolutely lost

26:43.667 --> 26:46.917
and He jumped in the river Sharayu

26:47.208 --> 26:52.458
and disappeared in the water element from where He had come.

26:53.542 --> 26:57.291
Now this man had to give up His wife.

26:57.500 --> 27:00.000
In this contrast you can see

27:00.208 --> 27:04.667
the wave rising and falling of a personality.

27:05.250 --> 27:09.333
The society in which He lived, the state which He ruled,

27:09.583 --> 27:14.834
had an objection for a wife, who had lived with Ravana.

27:15.208 --> 27:17.500
And the public started talking about it.

27:17.709 --> 27:22.458
So, as a good king, He just, as a good king,

27:22.667 --> 27:29.667
He just decided that His wife should be left forever.

27:32.583 --> 27:39.083
And then He sent Her on a beautiful chariot

27:39.583 --> 27:44.041
with His prime minister

27:44.250 --> 27:47.500
and His brother, Lakshmana,

27:47.750 --> 27:51.083
who took Her down and left Her, told Her,

27:51.291 --> 27:55.834
"This is what has happened and that Shri Rama has asked us

27:55.999 --> 28:00.792
to take you down to the ashram of Valmiki."

28:02.500 --> 28:09.208
As a result of that She got very upset and She said,

28:09.542 --> 28:12.291
She was Adi Shakti, so She doesn’t have to bother.

28:12.500 --> 28:14.750
She said, “You just leave Me here.”

28:14.959 --> 28:17.917
Very self-respecting person.

28:18.083 --> 28:20.959
She didn’t say, “No, no, no, no, I’ll come to Him”

28:21.125 --> 28:25.667
or “I’ll sue Him. I’ll go in the courts, get all His money.

28:25.875 --> 28:30.959
How dare He throw me out.”  Nothing of the kind.

28:33.834 --> 28:38.083
That’s the grace of a woman. Graciously She said, “All right,

28:38.291 --> 28:40.500
now you have listened to your brother.

28:40.709 --> 28:43.709
I’m your sister-in-law, elder too. Now you obey Me.

28:43.917 --> 28:48.250
And I tell you, as your sister-in-law, that you can now go.

28:48.458 --> 28:53.917
Leave Me here alone and I don’t want you to go any further with Me

28:54.083 --> 28:59.417
to deport Me with somebody. ” And She was pregnant.

29:01.208 --> 29:04.542
Here if it happens, of course horrible things can happen,

29:04.750 --> 29:08.125
but in India if such a thing happens, the wife will kill herself

29:08.333 --> 29:11.333
or she won’t be able to bear it.

29:11.542 --> 29:14.625
I think both things are just the same, an escape.

29:14.875 --> 29:18.583
If there’s no aggression then there is recession.

29:18.792 --> 29:22.250
But She said, “No. I have to give birth to these two children.

29:22.458 --> 29:25.417
I can look after Myself, all right. Graciously He’s done it,

29:25.625 --> 29:30.083
I am nothing and please tell Him not to worry about Me.”

29:30.750 --> 29:33.166
And She told Shri Rama, Shri Lakshmana that,

29:33.375 --> 29:36.208
“All right, you look after Him, that’s all I want.”

29:36.417 --> 29:40.125
And She told the chief minister, the mantri,

29:40.333 --> 29:44.792
that “You must look after the kingdom.”

29:48.500 --> 29:52.291
See the dignity, see the balance,

29:52.542 --> 29:55.917
see the character, the personality of Shri Rama.

29:56.250 --> 30:00.959
He was called as maryada purushottama. And look at His wife.

30:01.166 --> 30:04.709
She was equal to Him in every way.

30:05.625 --> 30:09.208
When She was kept by Ravana,

30:09.417 --> 30:16.083
Ravana was so frightened of Her Shakti that he would not touch Her.

30:16.667 --> 30:20.291
He used to frighten Her, say “I’ll do this to the women of India.

30:20.500 --> 30:22.125
I’ll do this to the women of the world.

30:22.333 --> 30:24.542
I’ll do that kind of a horrible thing.

30:24.750 --> 30:27.667
I’ll take another birth. I’ll misbehave.”

30:27.875 --> 30:31.542
She said, “Do what you like. You cannot touch Me.”

30:31.750 --> 30:37.125
He could not touch Her hand, he was so frightened.

30:37.834 --> 30:43.875
And when Hanumana brought the ring of Shri Rama

30:44.041 --> 30:51.291
and presented to Her and said that, “This is the ring of Shri Rama.”

30:51.750 --> 30:54.041
She said, “Yes, I know. How is He?” He said, “All right.”

30:54.250 --> 30:58.291
All enquiries She had about Herself. So He said,

30:58.500 --> 31:01.834
“Mother, I can take You on my back.

31:02.000 --> 31:05.542
I can easily take You. You come on My back and I’ll take You.”

31:05.750 --> 31:10.875
She said, “No. I won’t go with You. It's my ..

31:11.041 --> 31:17.083
It’s Shri Rama who is a brave king,

31:17.333 --> 31:24.333
He should come Himself, fight this Ravana, kill him because he’s evil,

31:25.166 --> 31:29.250
and then I will go with Him with all the glory.”

31:29.999 --> 31:32.125
She was not frightened of anything.

31:32.375 --> 31:36.583
For Her, the important thing was that Ravana should be killed.

31:36.875 --> 31:42.417
He’s evil and he should be killed by Rama.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.875
Such a great courage for a woman.

31:46.041 --> 31:50.667
Both sides if you see you’ll be surprised that how

31:50.999 --> 31:56.542
a woman’s character is such a powerful thing.

31:57.083 --> 31:58.500
It’s not a reactionary thing,

31:58.709 --> 32:01.500
“My husband is like this, that’s why I’m like that.”

32:01.709 --> 32:04.458
or “My husband doesn’t do this for me, that’s why I’m like that.

32:04.667 --> 32:06.667
My husband is gone away so I’m finished.

32:06.875 --> 32:09.125
What am I to do without my husband? ” Nothing of the kind.

32:09.333 --> 32:11.999
She stands on Her feet.

32:12.166 --> 32:15.208
She said “No,” to Hanumana

32:15.417 --> 32:19.458
and She stands on Her feet

32:19.667 --> 32:23.917
and She says, “When Rama will come and kill this evil

32:24.458 --> 32:27.625
and remove this evil from this earth,

32:27.834 --> 32:32.000
then only He can take Me with Him. I won’t go with You.

32:32.250 --> 32:34.750
I won’t escape. I won’t run away.

32:34.959 --> 32:38.500
Nothing.  I am going to face it Myself here.”

32:38.709 --> 32:41.375
For a woman it is too much to say,

32:41.583 --> 32:46.500
to be imprisoned in a horrible person’s jail

32:46.750 --> 32:51.667
or in a place which is so dangerous for Her,

32:51.875 --> 32:55.709
to say that “I won’t go. Whatever you may try,

32:55.917 --> 32:58.834
whatever tricks you may try, whatever you may say.

32:59.000 --> 33:01.458
I won’t go.”

33:01.750 --> 33:03.917
Just imagine.

33:04.333 --> 33:07.125
And Ravana was such a horrid fellow.

33:07.417 --> 33:11.667
He did all kinds of things to Her

33:11.875 --> 33:17.834
but She kept absolutely calm and quiet,

33:19.333 --> 33:22.625
waiting for Her husband to come back.

33:23.041 --> 33:27.291
Can we think of such women in modern times?

33:30.000 --> 33:36.083
So satisfied with themselves, so much in balance,

33:36.417 --> 33:43.208
so much full of confidence and strength.

33:46.333 --> 33:49.458
This is the message of Sita’s life.

33:49.709 --> 33:52.500
The benevolence of Shri Rama was shown

33:52.709 --> 33:57.083
when He started ruling the people.

33:58.542 --> 34:04.041
He was the one who cared for the needs of the people.

34:05.792 --> 34:10.959
For Him, it was important that the people whom He ruled

34:11.125 --> 34:14.250
should be happy and joyous.

34:14.500 --> 34:17.959
He looked after them with great love.

34:18.125 --> 34:21.291
He had two sons

34:21.542 --> 34:26.999
whom He looked after for a short time

34:27.166 --> 34:32.375
because they were lost with the mother, Sita,

34:32.875 --> 34:37.667
and they are the ones who found Him out in a way

34:37.999 --> 34:43.125
that Valmiki taught them how to sing the Ramayana.

34:43.333 --> 34:48.125
And they went to Ayodhya and sang the Ramayana.

34:48.542 --> 34:51.667
Rama went with them.

34:51.875 --> 34:55.333
And one day in one of the yagyas,

34:55.583 --> 34:59.166
when they caught the horse of Shri Rama,

35:00.625 --> 35:05.041
Hanumana found it impossible to fight those two boys

35:05.291 --> 35:07.250
and He couldn’t understand.

35:07.458 --> 35:12.250
Here now, the character of great Hanumana One has to describe.

35:12.458 --> 35:16.417
He went and told Shri Rama, “I can’t understand, these two boys,

35:16.625 --> 35:21.291
I can’t face them. I don’t know who they are.”

35:21.834 --> 35:25.125
So, Shri Rama went there.

35:25.333 --> 35:28.291
And these boys were standing with their arrows.

35:28.542 --> 35:33.041
Then Shri Sita appeared before them and She said,

35:33.250 --> 35:36.875
“You cannot fight. He is your father.”

35:37.959 --> 35:41.709
This made Hanumana realize it. And He said, “All right,

35:41.917 --> 35:46.792
I can fight Shri Rama now. Why did He leave you like this?”

35:47.375 --> 35:53.750
See the sweetness of Shri Hanumana who was such a great devotee,

35:53.959 --> 35:56.709
such a great devotee of Shri Rama,

35:56.917 --> 36:01.000
could see that, “He has done injustice to My Mother”

36:01.291 --> 36:03.250
and He stood for that.

36:03.500 --> 36:07.625
Is very sweet of Shri Hanumana to do that.

36:08.375 --> 36:14.291
Hanumana is, as you know, is the angel Gabriel

36:14.500 --> 36:20.875
who is innocence, simplicity, and dynamism.

36:21.542 --> 36:25.709
His dynamism was such that as soon as He was born,

36:25.917 --> 36:28.000
He said, “Better eat this sun

36:28.208 --> 36:33.875
because the sun is scorching the people in India.”

36:34.250 --> 36:36.999
So He went and gulped down the sun.

36:37.166 --> 36:40.875
People had to say that, “You see, though too the sun is scorching

36:41.041 --> 36:45.875
but it’s of great help. Please release the sun. Why did you eat it off?”

36:46.083 --> 36:48.667
So then He released the sun.

36:48.875 --> 36:53.917
Hanumana’s whole life was spent in serving Shri Rama.

36:54.083 --> 37:00.999
And He was such a dedicated bhakta of Shri Ram.

37:01.166 --> 37:06.333
Now here the contrast is also that Hanumana had navadha,

37:06.583 --> 37:12.709
navadha siddhis, navadha siddhis, nine siddhis,

37:13.125 --> 37:16.125
anima, ganima, raguma, and all sorts of things,

37:16.333 --> 37:19.166
that He could become small, He could become big, he could ...

37:19.375 --> 37:21.333
so many things He had.

37:21.542 --> 37:26.792
Despite all these siddhis and the amount of power He had,

37:26.999 --> 37:29.917
that Shri Rama once asked Him that,

37:30.083 --> 37:35.625
“My brother, Lakshmana, is being hit

37:35.875 --> 37:38.834
and he’s very sick. I mean, he’s just dying.

37:39.000 --> 37:43.083
So you go and get a particular kind of a sanjeevani,

37:43.291 --> 37:48.041
a kind of a herb, which I want to rub on his head.”

37:48.792 --> 37:51.750
So He went there and He found and he couldn’t find it

37:51.959 --> 37:56.542
so He brought the whole of the mountain on His hand and gave it to Rama,

37:56.750 --> 37:59.999
"Now You select, I don’t know. I can’t find it.”

38:00.458 --> 38:02.834
That is the Hanumana Shakti.

38:02.999 --> 38:07.750
And with all that power, He was such a humble person

38:07.959 --> 38:11.125
and such a dedicated person.

38:11.750 --> 38:16.208
This is the sign of a powerful Sahaja Yogi.

38:17.000 --> 38:23.999
Anybody who is powerful has to be humble and non-violent.

38:24.375 --> 38:27.333
Mahatma Gandhi used to say that,

38:27.583 --> 38:31.000
“What is the non-violence of the weak?”

38:31.250 --> 38:34.750
A weak has to be non-violent, what’s so great?

38:35.750 --> 38:41.667
But that’s a policy or a kind of a protection that he has.

38:41.959 --> 38:45.792
So a weak person has to be non-violent

38:45.999 --> 38:51.750
because he cannot face, he cannot protest.

38:52.083 --> 38:59.999
But non-violence of the powerful is the sign of real non-violence.

39:02.208 --> 39:06.208
Those who are powerful, if they are non-violent,

39:06.458 --> 39:11.208
that means they are quite confident of their powers.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.917
Those people who are confident of their powers,

39:14.083 --> 39:16.291
why should they aggress others?

39:16.500 --> 39:19.834
They just stand, “All right, come along, what do you want?”

39:20.000 --> 39:23.041
Even saying that, people run away.

39:24.709 --> 39:28.458
So those who are violent, angry, hot tempered,

39:28.709 --> 39:33.250
jump at everyone, torture everyone, trouble everyone,

39:33.458 --> 39:37.458
are the people who are very weak charactered.

39:37.750 --> 39:40.333
Their character is weak.

39:40.583 --> 39:43.333
If their character was all right

39:43.542 --> 39:46.875
then they would not have done all these things.

39:47.875 --> 39:53.208
That’s the sign of a person who is either possessed

39:53.417 --> 39:57.125
and under the influence of the possession - he’s doing that;

39:57.333 --> 40:01.083
or he’s too weak and he’s possessed by his anger

40:01.291 --> 40:07.166
because he doesn’t have that much power to bear anything.

40:08.041 --> 40:10.375
The most powerful thing is the Mother Earth

40:10.583 --> 40:12.667
because she has a power to bear.

40:12.875 --> 40:17.208
The one who has the power to bear, is the powerful.

40:18.125 --> 40:20.750
The one who does not have any power to bear,

40:20.959 --> 40:23.458
“I can’t bear. I don’t like. I this...”

40:23.667 --> 40:28.083
Such a person is a useless thing for this earth and sometimes I feel,

40:28.291 --> 40:31.375
“Why God created them?”

40:31.917 --> 40:34.792
It’s a headache to have a person round you,

40:34.999 --> 40:37.583
“I can’t eat this. I don’t like this.”

40:37.792 --> 40:41.834
Then why are you here? Nobody likes you either.

40:43.458 --> 40:46.333
No one likes such a person and that’s why that person is always,

40:46.542 --> 40:50.583
“I don’t like this. I don’t like that. I …”

40:53.250 --> 40:59.000
So the power of a person lies in bearing things.

40:59.333 --> 41:05.792
How much you can bear, how much you can undergo without feeling it?

41:05.999 --> 41:09.458
Like, you are say, in the jungle, you are happy.

41:09.667 --> 41:12.041
If you are in a palace you are happy.

41:12.250 --> 41:15.999
If you are with the this color or that color,

41:16.166 --> 41:18.792
if you are with this race or that race,

41:18.999 --> 41:24.999
if you are with this kind of life or that kind of life,

41:25.333 --> 41:27.083
you can bear it.

41:27.291 --> 41:32.834
And that bearing power gives you the caliber,

41:33.333 --> 41:38.500
the caliber to have Sahaja Yoga.

41:38.709 --> 41:45.792
It’s not that this is shown, it’s not that is being suffered,

41:46.875 --> 41:53.542
don’t have to say, “I suffer being like this.” No, you don’t suffer.

41:53.750 --> 41:56.792
It’s just by the way.

41:58.625 --> 42:02.333
For a person who wants all the comforts,

42:02.542 --> 42:07.625
a person who wants to live with all the luxuries,

42:08.625 --> 42:14.458
but not with any kind of defects or any deficiencies,

42:14.750 --> 42:19.750
is a person is a beggar, I would say, in every sense of the word.

42:20.750 --> 42:27.250
I mean, best things to get rid of problems is

42:27.792 --> 42:29.959
not to have them. In the sense,

42:30.125 --> 42:33.917
now I don’t drive so I have no problem of driving.

42:34.083 --> 42:39.500
I don’t have - I never telephone, so I don’t have problems of telephones.

42:41.208 --> 42:45.125
I don’t go to the banks, so I don’t have problems of the banks.

42:45.333 --> 42:50.709
The best is: I don’t have any income so I have no problem of income tax!

42:53.458 --> 42:56.208
Whatever bothers you, you just don’t have it.

42:56.458 --> 43:00.625
Why do you want to have it? Have it and then bother about it?

43:00.834 --> 43:04.667
It seems very funny that you can get rid of anything

43:04.875 --> 43:07.709
that bothers you very easily in this world.

43:07.917 --> 43:11.709
So you need not have that kind of a thing on your head.

43:11.917 --> 43:16.625
But when the word ‘problem’, specially in the European community

43:16.834 --> 43:19.125
‘problem’ is a very common word,

43:19.333 --> 43:23.291
but in English language we never learnt this word ‘problem’.

43:23.500 --> 43:30.625
You see only the ‘problem’ was used when we were studying geometry,

43:31.250 --> 43:35.250
geometrical problem, but we never knew there’s a 'problem' in life.

43:35.458 --> 43:38.917
Later on when I came in contact with European community,

43:39.083 --> 43:43.417
they’ll say, “There’s no problem." "This is the problem.”

43:43.709 --> 43:49.291
At least in one day hundred times they say ‘problem’ word.

43:50.041 --> 43:53.667
So, for a problem the solution is

43:53.875 --> 43:57.709
not to have that thing which gives you 'problem'.

43:57.917 --> 44:00.125
You can give up anything.

44:00.333 --> 44:02.875
Anything that you want, you can give up if you know

44:03.041 --> 44:06.500
how to detach yourself from that.

44:06.834 --> 44:10.834
Many people come and tell Me, “Mother we have an ego.

44:11.083 --> 44:15.542
That’s the problem.”  I said, “Then give up.”

44:15.959 --> 44:19.834
I mean, is simple, why do you have it?

44:20.250 --> 44:23.834
As if, you see, they want to say that, we

44:23.999 --> 44:28.375
“We have trouble with this thing but still we are clinging on to it.

44:28.625 --> 44:32.709
Like we are afraid of a crocodile

44:32.917 --> 44:37.083
but we want to put our foot into the mouth of the crocodile.

44:37.291 --> 44:42.625
And we have a problem that our foot will be eaten up by the crocodile.”

44:42.834 --> 44:46.458
Now give up.  But they will search out a crocodile,

44:46.667 --> 44:51.291
open the mouth, and put the foot in it and then come to Me and say,

44:51.500 --> 44:56.583
“Mother we have a problem. My foot is in the mouth of the crocodile.”

44:58.125 --> 45:01.959
To get to problems you have to get to it.

45:03.667 --> 45:09.999
But without getting to it, how will you get a problem?

45:10.625 --> 45:17.250
Say, for example, people have very silly, stupid problems. Now.

45:17.625 --> 45:19.875
The first problem somebody may have,

45:20.041 --> 45:24.208
“Oh I have to get my clothes pressed.”

45:24.417 --> 45:29.709
What’s the need? No problem. Wear them as they are. Who looks at it?

45:29.917 --> 45:32.250
“You see there are all the people who have pressed clothes.”

45:32.458 --> 45:35.792
Doesn’t matter what is there. If it is not pressed, such a, such a ...

45:35.999 --> 45:39.875
It’s a problem for them. It’s silly things like that,

45:40.041 --> 45:41.542
you’ll see very silly things.

45:41.750 --> 45:46.083
But the greatest problem I think you have is your watch.

45:46.375 --> 45:49.333
In Switzerland, I shouldn’t say so.

45:53.917 --> 46:00.792
You see the problem is like this, that now you have to go the airport.

46:01.250 --> 46:05.250
As soon as you tell somebody we have to go to the airport,

46:05.458 --> 46:11.875
now, I have to go, you don’t have to, everybody gets sort of a jumping

46:12.041 --> 46:15.375
as if standing on a jumping board. You see all of them jumping like that.

46:15.625 --> 46:18.250
“What’s the matter?” “Mother you have to go to the airport.”

46:18.458 --> 46:23.667
“So, it’s all right. I have to go. What’s, what's wrong with you?”

46:23.875 --> 46:26.166
“Is a problem. ” I say, “What’s the problem?

46:26.375 --> 46:30.083
I have to go. You just know that you don’t have to go at all

46:30.291 --> 46:32.458
and don’t have to come to the airport.

46:32.667 --> 46:35.959
And the aeroplane, if it comes and doesn’t take Me,

46:36.125 --> 46:38.208
I’m not going to come back on your heads

46:38.417 --> 46:41.417
so I’ll stay in a hotel. Don’t you worry.”

46:41.792 --> 46:44.500
But why are you so excited about it?

46:44.709 --> 46:47.125
The way people are excited that I must catch the plane,

46:47.333 --> 46:51.375
sometimes I feel as if they want to get rid of Me.

46:53.375 --> 46:59.417
So, this is a problem for people who are very meticulous.

46:59.625 --> 47:04.041
Now, supposing I say, “I know that the plane won’t leave Me.”

47:04.291 --> 47:08.125
I know, because I know many things so I have no problems,

47:08.333 --> 47:13.291
but supposing even if you think the plane you may not get,

47:13.917 --> 47:17.542
so it may not get.  But if it gets you, all right.

47:17.750 --> 47:21.625
If it doesn’t get you, it’s all right. So where is the problem?

47:21.834 --> 47:26.999
Either it will take you or it will not take you. What is in between?

47:27.625 --> 47:30.750
Where is the problem, I still don’t understand.

47:31.250 --> 47:33.917
Either it will work out or it will not work out.

47:34.083 --> 47:37.709
Keep two possibilities. That’s the only two possibilities.

47:37.917 --> 47:42.417
What is the third possibility that gives you the problem? You tell Me.

47:42.667 --> 47:45.417
Say somebody owes Me money. All right,

47:45.709 --> 47:49.500
so either he will give Me or he may not give Me.

47:49.750 --> 47:55.041
What is the problem?  The problem is that you call it a problem

47:55.250 --> 48:00.583
and want to avoid to face the truth.

48:01.291 --> 48:03.999
If you face the truth, you will know one thing

48:04.166 --> 48:07.333
that see now this man has to give me money. All right,

48:07.542 --> 48:08.999
I’ll go and face it.

48:09.166 --> 48:12.125
I’ll tell him, “Sir, you have to give me the money.

48:12.333 --> 48:17.583
You have to pay me. This is your duty

48:17.792 --> 48:20.500
and if you don’t pay me, you are doing wrong.”

48:20.750 --> 48:24.000
You get at him and face him and tell him.

48:24.208 --> 48:27.500
But you won’t do that. You’ll sit at home, “Oh God, it’s a problem.

48:27.709 --> 48:29.999
I have to, you see, that man is not giving money.

48:30.166 --> 48:32.041
Oh God. That’s a problem.”

48:32.250 --> 48:37.250
Sitting here, hitting your head all the time, how will you get it?

48:39.041 --> 48:44.250
If you face it directly then you’ll be amazed,

48:44.458 --> 48:47.875
there’s no problem for anything.

48:49.625 --> 48:52.625
Say your car fails. So it fails,

48:52.834 --> 48:56.917
get down, enjoy your self nicely till somebody comes along, takes you.

48:57.083 --> 49:00.917
Or, if supposing you don’t get some lift, all right,

49:01.083 --> 49:04.792
stay there overnight. What is it? No tiger is going to eat you.

49:05.000 --> 49:09.250
And if the tiger has to eat you, it will eat.

49:13.125 --> 49:17.000
Where is the problem?  Still I can’t see.

49:19.417 --> 49:22.834
I can’t see the problem.  If tiger has to eat,

49:23.000 --> 49:26.166
that’s already destined that the tiger has to eat.

49:26.375 --> 49:30.875
In any case, nobody dies. You’ll be born again.

49:32.999 --> 49:36.625
If you look at it from that angle

49:36.834 --> 49:40.333
then you’ll be surprised, most of the problems do not exist.

49:40.542 --> 49:44.625
They are like bubbles created by our own thinking,

49:44.834 --> 49:49.750
the waves of our thinking, “This is the problem. That is the problem.”

49:49.959 --> 49:52.709
Like today, they said there is no hall on such and such date.

49:52.917 --> 49:55.250
All right. “Where are you having the hall? ” “There.”

49:55.458 --> 49:58.709
“If there’s no hall, let us have it in the open.”

50:00.999 --> 50:08.125
So to make the best of it is, is the way Shri Rama shows you.

50:08.625 --> 50:12.750
Now, what is the way He has helped us, let us see.

50:13.500 --> 50:18.500
Shri Rama by His character, by His balance, His peace

50:18.709 --> 50:23.166
and His mildness and His sweetness has shown us

50:23.375 --> 50:25.583
how a king should be a benevolent king

50:25.792 --> 50:28.999
and at the same time a very loving husband

50:29.166 --> 50:32.208
and a loving father and a person in dharma,

50:32.417 --> 50:37.999
but apart from that, He went down to Maharashtra.

50:38.625 --> 50:40.250
He arranged all these things

50:40.458 --> 50:45.458
so that He could walk down to Maharashtra bare feet to vibrate the land

50:45.667 --> 50:49.000
because Sahaja Yogis will be going one day to Maharashtra

50:49.208 --> 50:52.458
and the Maharashtra has to be a vibrated land.

50:52.750 --> 50:58.208
In Ayodhya, He never took out His shoes because He was the king there.

50:58.417 --> 51:01.458
But when He went, and Shri Sita, both of them,

51:01.667 --> 51:05.709
when they went to Maharashtra They took out their shoes to vibrate it.

51:05.917 --> 51:09.875
On His way, He saw a big stone

51:10.041 --> 51:14.959
which was nothing but a lady cursed to be a stone, Ahilya.

51:15.125 --> 51:19.750
And He made her, just by touch, she again came back to life.

51:20.125 --> 51:25.417
Like that, one after another He was just, by the way, as if was doing,

51:25.625 --> 51:29.583
but that was the purpose of His life to go there.

51:31.667 --> 51:37.709
And that has helped a very great achievement within ourselves,

51:37.959 --> 51:40.125
is the Shri Ram.

51:40.333 --> 51:43.208
Shri Rama stands for the pranavayu,

51:43.417 --> 51:48.959
is for the vital air that we take in.

51:49.125 --> 51:54.125
For the vital air, and that vital air when it gets heated up,

51:54.333 --> 51:58.834
we have to know that we are not any more with Shri Ram.

51:58.999 --> 52:03.083
It has to be the cool air to blow through your nose and your mouth.

52:03.291 --> 52:07.333
I don’t know about you people, it happens with Me all the time.

52:08.792 --> 52:12.083
When you are angry the nostrils go up, swell up,

52:12.291 --> 52:16.375
and the hot air, the hot words, and everything hot,

52:16.583 --> 52:20.041
the heated eyes, and everything goes up like that, curled up,

52:20.250 --> 52:23.333
and you become ferocious Ravana,

52:23.542 --> 52:29.875
because you have forgotten the beauty of the nature of Shri Rama.

52:31.542 --> 52:35.375
What has He done to our center heart is the greatest thing,

52:35.583 --> 52:40.542
that He has given you a fatherhood within us.

52:40.792 --> 52:44.208
Because Shri Rama represents the fatherhood.

52:44.458 --> 52:47.583
Now what sort of a father you are, you have to decide.

52:47.792 --> 52:50.583
Those people who are not good fathers

52:50.792 --> 52:52.875
develop problems of the right heart.

52:53.041 --> 52:57.875
Also those people who are not good husbands

52:58.041 --> 53:01.375
also develop the right heart.

53:02.583 --> 53:05.291
This right heart is so important,

53:05.542 --> 53:10.500
because  specially in the west where the climate is so funny,

53:10.709 --> 53:13.999
you have to keep inside your rooms and closed all the time

53:14.166 --> 53:16.625
that you get all dried up inside

53:16.834 --> 53:21.709
at that time if you don’t have that sweetness, that warmth,

53:21.917 --> 53:26.083
that kindness of Shri Rama, you get the trouble of asthma.

53:26.291 --> 53:30.166
So many people die of asthma in the west.

53:30.417 --> 53:33.166
On top of that, you fight with your wives, ill-treat them,

53:33.417 --> 53:37.959
you take away their money, you cheat them in their money

53:38.125 --> 53:42.291
and every way you torture them then it becomes even worse.

53:43.250 --> 53:46.500
So it has something to do with money, in the sense,

53:46.709 --> 53:53.333
because Sitaji was Shri Lakshmi and Sitaji was the one

53:53.625 --> 53:57.417
who, who was the power of Shri Rama.

53:57.625 --> 54:01.375
So the Shri Lakshmi also gets annoyed with you

54:01.583 --> 54:04.709
when you are a bad father or a bad husband.

54:04.917 --> 54:07.792
That’s why the Gruha Lakshmi is very important.

54:07.999 --> 54:11.917
But the woman has to be the Gruha Lakshmi. She should not be a shrew

54:12.083 --> 54:14.625
and then the husband is supposed to be kind to her.

54:14.834 --> 54:17.041
Then it's spoiling. That's very bad.

54:17.250 --> 54:19.208
The woman has to be a Gruha Lakshmi,

54:19.417 --> 54:22.625
a beautiful woman with a very sweet nature

54:22.834 --> 54:27.041
and talking to her husband in a very sankoch manner

54:27.250 --> 54:32.458
and also looking after the children, looking after the family

54:32.667 --> 54:36.041
and looking after the guests who come to their house.

54:36.250 --> 54:41.166
But if you encourage and run after such women who are no good,

54:41.375 --> 54:44.458
means collectively they should be good;

54:44.667 --> 54:47.000
if collectively they do not act well,

54:47.208 --> 54:49.041
collectively if they are aggressive,

54:49.250 --> 54:51.999
collectively if they are tormenting others,

54:52.166 --> 54:55.125
then such women should not be encouraged at all,

54:55.333 --> 54:59.999
but then, Tulsidas says, they should be beaten up.

55:00.750 --> 55:05.750
Is a thing looks very bad in modern times if somebody says like that,

55:05.959 --> 55:11.500
that women should be beaten up in case they have all such qualities

55:11.709 --> 55:15.083
which disqualify them from being Gruha Lakshmis.

55:15.375 --> 55:20.250
Of course there’s no need to beat, but I mean to say that what is it

55:20.458 --> 55:24.250
that you have to drive out all these baddhas from your women,

55:24.458 --> 55:31.291
very important, otherwise if you fall in this activity

55:31.500 --> 55:34.709
of keeping your wives on right lines,

55:34.917 --> 55:39.417
you might also get a right heart and asthma ultimately.

55:40.041 --> 55:43.875
Because your wife and you are part of the society.

55:44.041 --> 55:48.250
And the society has certain laws which are very important.

55:48.500 --> 55:52.458
There’s something like stri-dharma, there’s something like pati-dharma,

55:52.667 --> 55:55.291
there’s something like mata-dharma,

55:55.500 --> 55:57.999
pita-dharma, everything has a dharma.

55:58.166 --> 56:01.500
Those men who torture their wives have very bad heart.

56:01.709 --> 56:04.834
In the same way, those who play into the hands of their wives

56:05.000 --> 56:08.000
also have a very bad right heart.

56:09.208 --> 56:13.834
You have to be in the balance. You are the husband, and she is your wife,

56:14.000 --> 56:19.709
and both are responsible for keeping a very good family relationship.

56:19.917 --> 56:22.999
It’s not one-sided. It’s not the husband only or the wife

56:23.166 --> 56:26.999
but both of them to be in such a manner

56:27.166 --> 56:31.250
that they act according to their nature of woman and man,

56:31.458 --> 56:33.917
and respect each other, love each other,

56:34.083 --> 56:37.917
share everything with each other and exist in a way

56:38.083 --> 56:41.542
that people should see that there are two wheels of a chariot,

56:41.750 --> 56:44.917
one on the left, one on the right, there’s no imbalance.

56:45.083 --> 56:49.375
They are equal but not similar as I have told many a time.

56:49.667 --> 56:52.834
Now in the case of Shri Rama, He left His wife.

56:53.000 --> 56:56.834
When it came to Sita, She left Him too.

56:57.000 --> 57:00.000
But She left Him as a woman would leave

57:00.208 --> 57:03.583
and He left Her as a man would leave.

57:05.500 --> 57:08.083
She also left Him.

57:09.917 --> 57:14.583
But in a way that is suitable for a woman to do.

57:15.041 --> 57:19.917
And He did it in a way that is suitable to a king.

57:20.500 --> 57:25.041
In the same way, a woman when she acts, she has to act like a woman.

57:25.291 --> 57:28.083
The same thing she may do as the man does,

57:28.291 --> 57:33.166
but she has to be a woman or a man has to be a man.

57:33.583 --> 57:35.917
So that’s the maryada purushottama,

57:36.125 --> 57:39.500
is the one who is the highest among all the men,

57:39.709 --> 57:44.917
which is all the maryada, all the boundaries that he observes.

57:45.166 --> 57:49.208
The boundaries are such that you do not try to overpower others

57:49.417 --> 57:54.999
or you do not try to take their seats.

57:55.417 --> 57:58.834
For example, I’ve seen those who are aggressive

57:59.083 --> 58:04.667
also show up in our programs, they will be the first before Me.

58:04.875 --> 58:07.417
They will be, as soon as I open the gates,

58:07.625 --> 58:10.500
they’ll be somewhere there standing.

58:10.750 --> 58:14.125
They, they will be the first in everything.

58:14.375 --> 58:18.041
That’s not being maryada. You should be at the back.

58:18.250 --> 58:21.875
Should be…, there are leaders you have got, they can sit in front.

58:22.041 --> 58:24.291
Try to be on the back. “I want to be first..."

58:24.500 --> 58:28.208
Then I’ve said once “the first of the first.”

58:28.875 --> 58:31.041
You know the story of first of the first.

58:31.291 --> 58:34.750
So you become first of the first and that’s what happens to you

58:34.959 --> 58:37.583
when you try to show off.

58:37.792 --> 58:41.999
And I know all of them who are like that.

58:43.166 --> 58:46.999
To be in the background

58:47.709 --> 58:51.792
is the most respectable thing to do.

58:52.500 --> 58:56.500
To go forward first, to jump forward first,

58:56.750 --> 58:59.375
to stand near the door if Mother is coming, you see.

58:59.583 --> 59:03.125
As soon as I see the person, I said, “Oh back again.”

59:03.999 --> 59:07.000
There’s some who do Aartis just because to show off,

59:07.208 --> 59:10.291
some throw flowers to show off, they must be the first.

59:10.500 --> 59:13.583
And, somehow or another, they get also the position

59:13.792 --> 59:17.208
because of their assertions and askings.

59:17.458 --> 59:19.208
The leaders have to be careful

59:19.417 --> 59:23.083
and not to give such eyed duties to people

59:23.333 --> 59:28.625
who really upset Me very much because of their arrogance,

59:28.917 --> 59:34.166
because of their showing offs.

59:34.750 --> 59:38.375
I have to say one thing today that, under the circumstances,

59:38.667 --> 59:43.083
we have to decide that if the leaders don’t have wives

59:43.291 --> 59:47.999
who are humble, who are kind, who are compassionate

59:48.291 --> 59:52.917
and who are Gruha Lakshmis, who are very sweet with the Collective,

59:53.083 --> 59:59.583
we’ll have to cancel the husband as well as the wife from the leadership.

01:00:00.667 --> 01:00:04.583
We cannot have leaders who have wives who are horrid.

01:00:04.792 --> 01:00:11.709
We cannot, because the wife of a leader is like a mother.

01:00:12.667 --> 01:00:19.583
There are five types of mothers described, one of them is the one

01:00:19.792 --> 01:00:22.959
who is the wife of the guru or of the leader.

01:00:23.125 --> 01:00:25.875
And if the leader has a wife of that kind

01:00:26.208 --> 01:00:29.917
it’s better in all sense he should withdraw.

01:00:30.208 --> 01:00:32.667
Improve his wife. Do whatever is possible.

01:00:32.875 --> 01:00:35.959
Till she’s all right, he should not be the leader.

01:00:36.125 --> 01:00:39.125
Is a very important thing because I have seen

01:00:39.333 --> 01:00:42.583
such women bring down the men, not only that,

01:00:42.792 --> 01:00:45.125
but bring down the Sahaja Yoga,

01:00:45.333 --> 01:00:49.750
Sahaja Yogis and the whole organization of God.

01:00:50.417 --> 01:00:54.792
So one has to be careful  and the women have to understand

01:00:54.999 --> 01:00:58.041
that if they are the wives of the leaders

01:00:58.250 --> 01:01:01.917
they have to be extremely good, kind,

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:07.542
generous, sharing, looking after,

01:01:07.750 --> 01:01:13.083
absolutely motherly, and should not tolerate nonsense

01:01:13.291 --> 01:01:17.291
and should correct when people are doing wrong.

01:01:17.542 --> 01:01:20.583
They should not report anyone to their husbands,

01:01:20.792 --> 01:01:24.875
should not take over themselves the responsibility of doing things

01:01:25.041 --> 01:01:27.667
which they are not supposed to do.

01:01:27.959 --> 01:01:32.999
If they are not of that level, they are of no use to people

01:01:33.208 --> 01:01:40.250
and they have no business to be proud of being the wives of the leaders.

01:01:42.041 --> 01:01:48.125
From Shri Rama’s life we learn a lot and from Sitaji’s life also.

01:01:48.333 --> 01:01:55.041
Both of them have done so much for us, bring forth such a great life.

01:01:55.250 --> 01:01:58.917
All their lives they suffered and suffered and suffered.

01:01:59.083 --> 01:02:02.500
They lived in the villages. They lived in the forest.

01:02:02.750 --> 01:02:05.667
While they were the king and the queen they had never known

01:02:05.875 --> 01:02:10.500
what is discomfort. They traveled all the way bare feet.

01:02:10.709 --> 01:02:13.959
They went through all kinds of tortures of life.

01:02:14.125 --> 01:02:18.959
Sita was taken away by Ravana, who was a horrid man.

01:02:19.125 --> 01:02:21.542
She had to live with a rakshasa, can you imagine?

01:02:21.750 --> 01:02:26.291
She lived with a rakshasa and there She showed her greatness.

01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:33.750
The characters of different nature, like Sita and Shri Rama,

01:02:34.125 --> 01:02:40.792
they were showing the complementary attributes

01:02:40.999 --> 01:02:44.125
that there are, very complementary, and if that is so

01:02:44.333 --> 01:02:48.834
then the husband wife’s relations beautiful are in Sahaja Yoga.

01:02:48.999 --> 01:02:53.834
That’s the way it should be. I find some people are very nice.

01:02:53.999 --> 01:02:58.542
Some leaders are extremely nice, but wives can be very hard,

01:02:58.750 --> 01:03:03.999
can be very stiff,

01:03:04.417 --> 01:03:11.750
or could be very mischievous, could be troublesome, selfish.

01:03:13.458 --> 01:03:16.709
You cannot grow in Sahaja Yoga with these qualities.

01:03:16.999 --> 01:03:21.375
It's such a luck and chance that your husband is the leader,

01:03:21.583 --> 01:03:26.709
is the highest man in your nation in Sahaja Yoga

01:03:26.917 --> 01:03:32.500
and where you have to be up to his ability,

01:03:32.709 --> 01:03:38.125
capability and his name, otherwise you have no authority.

01:03:38.542 --> 01:03:42.375
That’s why I have to tell you that on this day of Dassera,

01:03:42.625 --> 01:03:49.375
let us decide that we are going to have Ramraj in Sahaja Yoga,

01:03:49.625 --> 01:03:54.291
where there is benevolence, there is love, compassion,

01:03:54.500 --> 01:03:59.959
security, peace, joy, discipline among ourselves.

01:04:00.125 --> 01:04:02.375
The whole disciplining is within ourselves.

01:04:02.583 --> 01:04:05.125
What I say about Shri Rama is that

01:04:05.333 --> 01:04:10.000
He Himself has put Himself into the discipline of maryada.

01:04:10.208 --> 01:04:13.500
In the same way, we ourselves should put ourselves

01:04:13.709 --> 01:04:17.166
into the discipline of maryada.

01:04:18.417 --> 01:04:21.709
Is a very great thing that it should happen in Switzerland

01:04:21.917 --> 01:04:26.125
because Switzerland needs it the most,

01:04:26.959 --> 01:04:29.999
the blessings of Shri Ram.

01:04:31.208 --> 01:04:34.999
The way it is going on in this country,

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:42.500
this very selfish, non-benevolent activities going on,

01:04:42.792 --> 01:04:49.291
ruining all the poorer nations by this kind of a selfish attitude,

01:04:49.500 --> 01:04:53.417
a very narrow attitude, very low level attitude

01:04:53.625 --> 01:04:59.667
towards the money of these poorer nations.

01:05:00.542 --> 01:05:04.875
Is important, very important for us today

01:05:05.041 --> 01:05:09.083
to pray for the emancipation of the hearts of those people

01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.959
who are just butchering.

01:05:12.125 --> 01:05:14.959
In these modern times, we don’t have wars

01:05:15.125 --> 01:05:18.125
but financially they are butchering people,

01:05:18.333 --> 01:05:23.291
they are killing them by depriving them of their own money

01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:26.542
and their own benevolence.

01:05:27.959 --> 01:05:30.500
So, if Ramrajya has to come,

01:05:30.709 --> 01:05:34.667
then Rama is to be born in the hearts of people

01:05:34.917 --> 01:05:37.959
who are at the helm of affairs. And that’s how

01:05:38.125 --> 01:05:42.667
we have to pray to Shri Ram  that, “Be kind and compassionate

01:05:42.875 --> 01:05:47.208
so that you could be born into the hearts of these people.”

01:05:48.999 --> 01:05:52.959
May God bless you all.

May I have some water please.
