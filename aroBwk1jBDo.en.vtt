WEBVTT

00:01.301 --> 00:04.492
in any place
where we want to start

00:04.706 --> 00:11.241
a work or do anything about it, because He
is innocence and innocence was created

00:11.442 --> 00:14.110
before everything else was created.

00:14.311 --> 00:23.268
Is the most powerful power, I should say,
innocence.

00:23.593 --> 00:27.977
And then we’ll do the Guru Puja which is
actually

00:28.178 --> 00:33.237
the Adi Guru, the Primordial Master, who
incarnated on this Earth many a times.

00:33.438 --> 00:41.347
And, as you know, as Dattatreya He was born,

00:41.563 --> 00:48.252
as Janaka, Nanaka and many others.

00:48.515 --> 00:51.777
That principle is within us and that is
very important

00:51.978 --> 00:59.273
that we should develop the principle
of Guru Nanak or Janak

00:59.474 --> 01:05.463
or anyone of these primordial masters.
Because if the Spirit is the master,

01:05.664 --> 01:14.208
we have to become the master of ourselves.
And the power of the masters are

01:14.409 --> 01:26.677
that they are essences of the innocence –
of the creator,

01:28.147 --> 01:34.059
of the sustainer and the destroyer.

01:35.828 --> 01:40.786
They are the innocence of all these. Out
of them – this great personality –

01:40.987 --> 01:47.959
innocence of these three personalities
was created this great incarnation.

01:48.160 --> 01:53.577
And their innocence is shown by their
detachment to things – they live everywhere

01:53.778 --> 01:58.573
just like other human beings – married,
living in the families,

01:58.774 --> 02:05.554
but absolutely detached. Unless and until
this principle is awakened in you,

02:05.755 --> 02:08.954
you cannot do Sahaja Yoga.

02:09.763 --> 02:17.338
First of all, this principle of Guru must
be awakened in you which gives you balance

02:17.836 --> 02:23.970
and then the ascent has to be brought in
through the Spirit, the Atma.

02:24.171 --> 02:27.958
That is done by the Shakti, by
the Kundalini Herself.

02:28.159 --> 02:33.080
She’s the Shakti, She’s the womb. She’s
the one Who nourishes, first of all.

02:33.281 --> 02:39.655
She nourishes that power within us,
nourishes us, nourishes all our chakras.

02:39.856 --> 02:48.183
By which She cures our mental, emotional,
physical, spiritual being.

02:48.384 --> 02:51.274
Because sometimes we bow to wrong type
of people,

02:51.475 --> 02:54.600
our spiritual being is also very much hurt.

02:54.801 --> 02:58.364
And after that, after She has achieved
that,

02:58.565 --> 03:07.956
then She ascends through your fontanel bone
and gives you the Self Realization.

03:08.157 --> 03:13.492
So it is She who is the giver of your
moksha.

03:14.004 --> 03:18.724
She is the one who is the giver of
the peace, of the joy,

03:18.925 --> 03:24.297
and this Mother of yours resides in you
and She gives you the Realization.

03:24.498 --> 03:29.027
So we worship Her as the power within you,
so that you are empowered,

03:29.228 --> 03:37.633
you become powerful. But this power makes
you the master.

03:37.834 --> 03:42.034
When She comes in the Void area, She makes
you the Master

03:42.235 --> 03:49.808
because She enlightens that Guru principle
within you and you become the Master,

03:50.009 --> 03:55.303
you become the master of yourself and by
that you become the Master of others also.

03:55.504 --> 04:00.120
The one who is not the Master of oneself
cannot be the Master of others.

04:00.321 --> 04:05.134
So it works out, first of all, on you and
then it radiates.

04:05.335 --> 04:10.640
And that radiation makes others also accept
you as the guru.

04:10.841 --> 04:20.572
The dynamism and that compassionate
attitude

04:20.773 --> 04:27.014
all develops through this Guru principle.

04:27.215 --> 04:32.656
But this is the blessing of the Kundalini,
the Womb, the Mother,

04:32.857 --> 04:35.937
the one who we call as Aquarius.

04:36.138 --> 04:42.616
This is residing within us and we have to
just accept

04:42.817 --> 04:48.826
Her manifestation and welcome Her with
open heart.

04:49.027 --> 04:55.593
And know that today is the day when we are
expecting human beings

04:55.794 --> 05:01.593
to rise to that level where they become
compassion, love, affection.

05:02.798 --> 05:08.493
This is the new awareness with which we are
going to be

05:08.694 --> 05:12.278
completely fulfilled and unless and until
that happens

05:12.479 --> 05:18.284
there’s no chance for the emancipation,
no doubt about it.

05:20.184 --> 05:25.405
We have worked out so many things in so
many places

05:25.606 --> 05:30.271
and every place, I find, has a different
problem.

05:30.779 --> 05:36.017
The most difficult, I find, is America,
it’s like Mathura

05:36.218 --> 05:39.310
where Shri Krishna had to go and establish
Himself,

05:39.511 --> 05:45.237
that was the Kingdom of Shri Krishna and
where Kamsa was ruling.

05:45.438 --> 05:50.981
So the people in Mathura were the most
difficult people because they were governed

05:51.182 --> 05:56.313
by devils and the devils have a capacity
to dominate good people.

05:56.520 --> 06:00.249
They’re all so dominated that even where
Shri Krishna lived,

06:00.450 --> 06:08.550
they tried to go and harm Him and kill Him
and all that.

06:08.751 --> 06:14.056
And all the dynamism of these people from
Mathura was killed by Kamsa

06:14.257 --> 06:19.784
who was to be killed by Shri Krishna.

06:19.985 --> 06:23.345
Surprisingly, the first day I came to New
York for the puja,

06:23.546 --> 06:29.730
the first day it was written “Parivartani
Ekadashi”.

06:29.931 --> 06:36.595
Now “Ekadesha” is the power with which
the people are going to be destroyed.

06:36.796 --> 06:41.747
Now that is “Parivartani” means the one
by which you are going to be transformed.

06:41.948 --> 06:46.327
So, how is it the power that is going
to destroy is going to transform you.

06:46.528 --> 06:52.929
Firstly, it will destroy all that is
oppressive, all that kills your dynamism,

06:53.130 --> 06:57.465
all that makes you slave, that is going
to be destroyed.

06:57.666 --> 07:00.860
Secondly, people will be frightened,
the halfbaked ones

07:01.061 --> 07:07.142
who are neither here nor there, that we’ll
be destroyed and that awe will change them.

07:07.343 --> 07:11.750
Thirdly, when you see that your kith and
kin are going to be destroyed,

07:11.951 --> 07:16.324
then you’ll have much more compassion,
much more tolerance for them

07:16.525 --> 07:20.835
and you’ll try to save them all. So that is
what it is,

07:21.036 --> 07:27.276
where Shri Krishna had to raise a complete
mountain on His fingertip,

07:27.477 --> 07:32.405
you see like this, to the right side,
“Govardhandhari” He was called.

07:32.606 --> 07:35.991
That is what is my job here, is to raise
the mountain again

07:36.192 --> 07:42.280
and raise it on my finger tip like that.
But this finger has to be strong

07:42.481 --> 07:50.089
and this finger is nothing but the Sahaja
Yogis of America and they have to help

07:50.290 --> 07:58.188
by their dynamic behaviour and by their
proper understanding, responsibility

07:58.389 --> 08:05.096
as the people belonging to this great
nation of Fatherhood.

08:05.297 --> 08:10.836
This is the finger of the Father and that
Fatherhood has to be dynamic,

08:11.037 --> 08:19.494
has to be overpowering and has to be very
responsible.

08:19.695 --> 08:23.200
And in that responsibility you learn so
many things –

08:23.401 --> 08:26.853
so that’s my job is, that’s my goal is.
She (tv host) asked me in the TV,

08:27.054 --> 08:30.294
“What is your goal, Mother?” I didn’t tell
her that I have to raise

08:30.495 --> 08:33.646
the mountain on my finger, you see, she
would never have understood that.

08:33.847 --> 08:36.516
But that is what one has to do here.

08:36.717 --> 08:42.484
To raise the mountain and I find it’s like
that – Mountainous.

08:42.685 --> 08:48.550
And base of the mountain seems to be Houston
which is the most difficult part of it,

08:48.751 --> 08:55.143
they just don’t move, they just don’t move,
its jada it's very, very ‘tamasic’,

08:55.344 --> 09:00.577
it’s so full of ignorance and so full
of heaviness.

09:00.778 --> 09:04.845
That is the most difficult part and that’s
why – for Houston specially –

09:05.046 --> 09:10.399
we should do a nice puja to the Kundalini
that She rises in Houston.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.289
May God bless you all.

09:17.921 --> 09:21.516
Can you give me the handkerchief.

09:38.317 --> 09:41.497
Yogi: Today it’s said it’s Anant
Chaturdashi. Shri Mataji: Uh?

09:41.698 --> 09:45.406
Yogi: Anant Chaturdashi.
Shri Mataji: Today? Ah-ah!

09:45.607 --> 09:49.493
That’s great! Yes, must be. I was wondering
Anant Chaturdashi.

09:49.694 --> 09:55.347
Anant Chaturdashi is the day when we

09:57.336 --> 10:03.712
‘visarjan’– dissolve Shri Ganesha
in the water.

10:03.987 --> 10:07.581
(Hindi : it’s that day we put the Ganesha
in to the water)

10:07.782 --> 10:13.578
Because He’s established for ten days and
after ten days, He’s born on the fourth,

10:13.779 --> 10:19.531
after ten days He’s dissolved in the water
so that everywhere His Power is spread

10:19.732 --> 10:23.912
through the water. That’s why no wonder
there was a puja.

10:24.113 --> 10:27.661
Ganesha settled down into the water.

10:27.862 --> 10:31.980
That is Ananta Chaturdashi. Ananta is the,
is Shri Ganesha.

10:32.181 --> 10:36.831
Ananta means which cannot be destroyed.
Innocence cannot be destroyed.

10:37.032 --> 10:41.753
And that is why is the Ganesh Chaturdashi
means the day

10:41.954 --> 10:47.062
when Ganesha is dissolved in the water,

10:47.634 --> 10:56.117
in the ocean or He is created, worshipped
for ten days and again given back.

10:58.293 --> 11:04.076
So it’s a very great day today, I should
say, like the resurrection of Christ

11:04.277 --> 11:10.439
that you are,

11:12.711 --> 11:16.850
you had Christ here, He lived with you,

11:17.051 --> 11:21.619
and then went back to His Father. Father is
the ocean

11:21.820 --> 11:26.996
and that’s what in India they do, establish
Him on the fourth day

11:27.197 --> 11:30.631
and on the tenth day they put Him back
to the ocean.

11:30.832 --> 11:34.360
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in
our school. Shri Mataji: Beg your pardon?

11:34.561 --> 11:36.669
Yogi: I said we used to do the same
thing in our school. Shri Mataji: Eh?

11:36.870 --> 11:38.906
Yogi: We used to do the same thing in our
school.

11:39.107 --> 11:43.062
Other yogi: He says that he did the same in
his school, they used to make the Ganesha.

11:43.263 --> 11:48.444
Shri Mataji: Really? What school?
Yogi: (School name).

11:48.650 --> 11:54.282
Yogi: So we used to have a statue and four
of the guys used to carry them on.

11:54.483 --> 11:57.212
Shri Mataji: But no one understands. They
just do it without understanding

11:57.413 --> 12:01.246
what they are doing about it. So it’s
a thing, even in India

12:01.447 --> 12:03.772
how many people know about Ganesha,
no one knows.

12:03.973 --> 12:07.038
Yogini: In Maharastra. Shri Mataji: In
Maharastra, they worship Him a lot

12:07.239 --> 12:10.912
but they don’t know much about it. They
don’t know how much He’s important,

12:11.113 --> 12:15.028
about what He represents, how did He came
on this earth, nothing they know.

12:15.229 --> 12:19.563
We have become very superficial that way.

12:23.408 --> 12:27.467
But at least it keeps your attention by
doing all these things, “there”.

12:27.668 --> 12:31.857
You see, this is the advantage of in India,
the children have to be little bit

12:32.058 --> 12:37.389
pinned down to a thing they, by festivals
and all that they try to then find out

12:37.590 --> 12:41.241
what is this, what is that. Their attention
is more there, not outside so much,

12:41.442 --> 12:43.758
you see, that’s the thing is.
