00:00.000 --> 00:08.920
Are
October 5, 1981

00:10.000 --> 00:18.400
Public Program, Houston, Texas, USA

01:25.055 --> 01:38.715
Yesterday I told you that God has created
us with a purpose and unless and until we

01:38.746 --> 01:45.646
find out our purpose, unless and until we
find out our absolute, we are going to seek

01:45.646 --> 01:49.316
and we are not going to be happy.

01:49.316 --> 01:52.826
He has done everything, very beautifully.

01:52.826 --> 01:56.776
Now we should understand what are we really,
inside.

01:56.776 --> 02:05.116
Moreover, as I explained to you yesterday,
that whatever I say is to be taken as a hypothesis,

02:05.116 --> 02:11.876
as a scientist who would keep his mind open
and see for himself, because everything is

02:11.876 --> 02:14.546
not known to you.

02:14.546 --> 02:20.936
And whatever I say, you have to keep your
mind open, you need not accept Me blindly

02:20.936 --> 02:25.156
because blind faith is of no use.

02:25.156 --> 02:33.596
But, if you get your enlightenment, you get
your Self-realization, you actualize it, you

02:33.596 --> 02:40.926
become, then you have to verify for yourself
whatever I say, is it true or not?

02:40.926 --> 02:49.916
For example, if I say that the Christ, our
Lord, is placed in this center of ours, at

02:49.916 --> 02:54.476
the Agnya Chakra, which I’ll explain to
you in details.

02:54.476 --> 03:04.658
You are not to believe Me that He’s placed
there, but you have to see for yourself when

03:04.924 --> 03:08.499
you get your realization, you will be able
to raise the Kundalini of other people.

03:08.499 --> 03:12.499
And when you start raising the Kundalini you
will find that it will stop at this point

03:12.499 --> 03:19.299
– because you will become your own gurus,
the Kundalini will move at your fingers, and

03:19.299 --> 03:25.689
then when you find the Kundalini has stopped
here you’ll be amazed that you will have

03:25.689 --> 03:32.099
to ask the seeker or the subject to say the
Lord’s Prayer.

03:32.099 --> 03:37.688
And that’s the only way you can get out
the Kundalini from that center.

03:39.907 --> 03:41.382
It’s a mantra.

03:41.407 --> 03:46.469
It’s a mantra, it’s a chanting, which
was given to us.

03:46.469 --> 03:52.079
He could have given the bija mantra, the seed
of that chanting is Ham-ksham.

03:52.079 --> 03:59.819
But, He didn’t give because He thought people
would be, specially Christians would be very

03:59.819 --> 04:04.139
rational people, so He thought better give
a complete explanation of the whole thing.

04:04.139 --> 04:07.319
But every word of it is a mantra.

04:07.319 --> 04:11.447
But it is to be awakened; if it is not awakened,
it’s dead.

04:11.472 --> 04:17.299
It is to be awakened, this is the basis of
Sahaj Yoga.

04:17.299 --> 04:18.489
“Saha” is “born.”

04:18.489 --> 04:20.305
With you, Saha-ja.

04:20.330 --> 04:24.149
“Ja” means “born” and “Saha” is
“with” – is born with you, spontaneous,

04:24.149 --> 04:27.664
it’s living process within you, is your
own right, you must have it.

04:27.969 --> 04:34.589
So this is a living process and the living
happening should take place.

04:34.589 --> 04:39.879
You should become your absolute; you should
become your own guru; you should get complete

04:39.904 --> 04:47.419
integration within yourself; and then you
will be able to discriminate because the all-pervading

04:47.419 --> 04:54.569
Power, about which I told you yesterday, is
surrounding, is everywhere, only you are to

04:54.569 --> 05:01.789
be awakened; once you are awakened you can
start feeling them, the existence of that,

05:01.789 --> 05:05.599
around you, on your fingers.

05:05.599 --> 05:13.989
Imagine on your fingers you start feeling
that Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

05:13.989 --> 05:21.099
That should happen to all of us and the time
has come, the blossom time has come and thousands

05:21.099 --> 05:23.009
must get their realization.

05:23.009 --> 05:29.109
With this today I would explain to you the
different centers we have within ourselves

05:29.109 --> 05:32.629
and the chakras that are within us.

05:32.629 --> 05:38.819
I was amazed, in New York they said that people
are taking lot of money for this chakra therapy,

05:38.819 --> 05:44.409
I mean I just can’t understand what they
do about it, but all those who came from this

05:44.409 --> 05:47.469
chakra therapies, had all their chakras ruined
completely.

05:47.469 --> 05:52.539
I mean, you pay to ruin your chakras, I just
couldn’t understand.

05:52.539 --> 05:57.309
Anybody coming from India is not a saint,
on the contrary, as I told you, there could

05:57.309 --> 05:59.883
be greatest thuggery in India.

06:00.684 --> 06:01.347
Yes.

06:01.372 --> 06:05.209
They are very intelligent, cunning people,
they can be very good.

06:05.209 --> 06:13.669
If they are good, they are very, very good
and if they are bad, they are horrid.

06:13.669 --> 06:22.229
So you have to be careful when you think of
an Indian that, as we cannot say that all

06:22.229 --> 06:30.322
Americans are Mr. Ford, in the same way Indians
also, you must know how to discriminate.

06:30.534 --> 06:36.192
First of all your discrimination power must
come, otherwise you won’t be able to make

06:36.217 --> 06:40.049
out who is the real, who is not the real.

06:40.049 --> 06:41.259
That must happen to you.

06:41.259 --> 06:48.089
Unless and until that happens the rest of
it is, is of no use, because as I said this

06:48.089 --> 06:52.909
room is dark and your eyes are closed, when
you come inside you see nothing but darkness

06:52.909 --> 06:56.629
and I start telling you, “this is this,
this is this and I tell you there’s one

06:56.629 --> 07:01.129
elephant you can’t see here and there’s
one tiger sitting here,” you just believe

07:01.129 --> 07:02.129
it.

07:02.129 --> 07:04.979
And there’s nothing like that here.

07:04.979 --> 07:11.544
And you people are definitely much more honest
that you can’t believe how people could

07:11.569 --> 07:13.717
be such fake.

07:13.824 --> 07:16.968
Oh, there can be fake people all over the
world.

07:17.179 --> 07:24.085
I am ashamed of it sometimes when I see that
in the great country of yoga, where such great

07:24.155 --> 07:34.749
incarnations came in, such great work of the
saints has been done, horrible people also

07:34.749 --> 07:40.642
are born in the same place because that’s
the place they want to harm, they want to

07:40.667 --> 07:41.667
attack.

07:43.059 --> 07:48.736
They are negative, not only negative but they
are very, very dangerous.

07:49.664 --> 07:54.439
I may tell about them tomorrow or day after,
but today I want to tell you about the good

07:54.464 --> 07:56.118
things that you are.

07:56.119 --> 08:00.225
The beauty that you are and how beautifully
you are made within yourself.

08:00.670 --> 08:06.929
So within us, as I told you, lies this residual
power called as Kundalini.

08:06.954 --> 08:16.471
This is the part of the all-pervading Power
which thinks, which understands, which coordinates,

08:16.496 --> 08:17.687
which loves.

08:17.800 --> 08:22.449
Is the integration of all these powers within
us, as this Kundalini.

08:22.449 --> 08:26.981
Now so many books have been written about
Kundalini.

08:27.006 --> 08:34.308
When I read them I was shocked that how could
people write books about Kundalini without

08:34.308 --> 08:41.546
understanding what it meant, without understanding
where it was.

08:41.571 --> 08:47.959
Such big books have been written on Kundalini,
which says, “The Kundalini is in the stomach,

08:47.984 --> 08:50.450
some say this Kundalini’s in the nose.

08:50.450 --> 08:54.458
I don’t know how could people write, I mean
it takes nothing for them to write something

08:54.483 --> 08:59.360
and to publish, and they are not afraid of
God that they are writing all these nonsensical

08:59.385 --> 09:01.595
things without understanding it.

09:01.884 --> 09:05.735
So this is the Kundalini that is placed in
the sacrum bone.

09:06.026 --> 09:11.636
Now this bone, even in English is called as
sacrum, this word comes from Greece as I told

09:11.661 --> 09:13.960
you that Greek people knew about Kundalini.

09:14.175 --> 09:16.000
Sacrum means sacred.

09:16.025 --> 09:18.266
This bone is a sacred bone.

09:18.291 --> 09:26.742
And why is it a sacred bone because the Kundalini,
the primordial desire within us to be one

09:27.062 --> 09:32.224
with the Divine, is still unmanifested and
sleeping, and is the safest place where it

09:32.249 --> 09:33.249
has to be.

09:33.249 --> 09:40.922
Now you are paying attention to Me, now if
I say you pay attention to yourself, you cannot.

09:40.930 --> 09:43.542
You may say, “I’m paying attention,”
but you cannot, you cannot take your attention

09:43.567 --> 09:44.542
inside.

09:44.616 --> 09:49.746
But if there is some happening within you,
then your attention is drawn inside, so it

09:49.746 --> 09:56.736
is built like this that at a human level this
happening will take place of sprouting.

09:56.736 --> 10:02.675
And when this sprouting takes place, then
your attention is pulled inside.

10:02.675 --> 10:09.830
This attention has gone out because of the
prismatic, as you say the prism here, prismatic

10:09.855 --> 10:12.925
action of the brain of a human being.

10:12.925 --> 10:18.424
I will not go into the details of it, but
there is a big science about that: why our

10:18.449 --> 10:20.828
attention is outside all the time.

10:22.129 --> 10:30.495
Now below the Kundalini, which is three-and-a-half
coils, is placed a very important center of

10:30.495 --> 10:33.428
innocence, is the center of innocence.

10:33.670 --> 10:39.945
The first thing that was emitted out of the
all-pervading Power was, it had the form,

10:39.945 --> 10:46.435
I should say the all-pervading Power was nothing
but just innocence, which is the most powerful

10:46.435 --> 10:50.315
thing in this world, is your innocence.

10:50.340 --> 10:57.357
And this innocence is placed below the Kundalini,
and is adorned by the deity called as Shri

10:57.382 --> 11:02.174
Ganesha, who has a trunk like an elephant.

11:02.435 --> 11:07.365
This is the bija; this is the seed of Christ.

11:07.365 --> 11:14.155
This forms the seed, and then He incarnated
on this earth, this is the subtle form, on

11:14.155 --> 11:23.135
this earth as Mahavishnu – is written down
in the Devi Purana – or we call Him as Christ.

11:23.135 --> 11:28.505
The name Christ and His name Jesus also has
a very big meaning and relates to something

11:28.505 --> 11:30.565
that happened before Him.

11:30.565 --> 11:38.515
Now this great incarnation of Christ came
on this earth, which was nothing but innocence,

11:38.515 --> 11:46.565
innocence itself took the form and it was
the all-pervading Power itself which took

11:46.565 --> 11:51.715
the form and came on this earth.

11:51.715 --> 11:55.935
That’s why this is a very important center,
is the beginning.

11:55.935 --> 12:03.655
Because it is innocence, is like a lotus and
it is placed at a point where the gate to

12:03.655 --> 12:05.575
hell are open within us.

12:05.575 --> 12:12.295
This center gives rise in the gross … Now
this is a subtle center called as Mooladhara

12:12.320 --> 12:12.891
Chakra.

12:12.916 --> 12:14.321
Chakra Mooladhara.

12:14.588 --> 12:18.368
Mooladhara means the support of the root.

12:18.393 --> 12:21.044
Now root is the Kundalini.

12:21.044 --> 12:23.505
It is the support of the root.

12:23.505 --> 12:29.455
Kundalini is the Mother, and this is your
innocence, this is your childhood and that’s

12:29.455 --> 12:30.455
the Mother.

12:30.455 --> 12:37.733
And the Mother is there to give you your realization,
waiting all the time, She is your own individual

12:37.758 --> 12:45.855
Mother, and She is just waiting, ages together,
to give you the experience of Self-realization,

12:45.855 --> 12:48.363
to give you your second birth.

12:48.473 --> 12:57.013
Now the last center looks after, in the gross,
the Pelvic Plexus, which you have heard of,

12:57.013 --> 13:05.782
which has also got four sub-plexuses, this
has also got four petals as we call it.

13:05.782 --> 13:07.983
There are four petals.

13:07.983 --> 13:15.983
So this center looks after the pelvic plexus
in the gross, which looks after the excretion.

13:15.983 --> 13:23.762
This center we must consider at length, a
little bit, which is very important to understand

13:23.762 --> 13:33.404
that this also looks after the sex and reproduction,
mainly the sex and other excretions.

13:33.725 --> 13:38.248
Now you can see here that it is placed below
the Kundalini.

13:38.483 --> 13:42.728
That means sex does not play any part in your
evolution.

13:42.728 --> 13:44.328
It does not.

13:44.328 --> 13:50.548
Those people who say that sex has something
to do with Kundalini, are really blasphemous

13:50.548 --> 13:58.097
and very ugly people because you cannot put
sex to your Mother.

13:58.097 --> 14:03.507
It’s something, even today is not accepted,
when people have become so much lenient about

14:03.507 --> 14:05.778
sex, is not accepted.

14:05.995 --> 14:11.852
And this is what it is when people talk of
sex and Kundalini together.

14:11.985 --> 14:18.588
As a Mother, I give them a little chance or
sort of a little grace because to say that

14:18.588 --> 14:24.838
they originated all this from deliberate action
will be too much.

14:24.838 --> 14:29.668
I would say that maybe they when they were
meditating, at the sex point they might have

14:29.668 --> 14:33.556
seen Ganesha’s trunk which they might have
thought to be the Kundalini.

14:33.658 --> 14:37.318
Possibly that’s how they went into a wrong
situation.

14:37.318 --> 14:39.507
But of course it’s a very wrong thing.

14:39.507 --> 14:47.887
We have had cases in New York and here also
where the private parts of people were touched

14:47.887 --> 14:54.068
by some of the people, and are having a very
bad time with that action.

14:54.068 --> 14:55.928
It’s your private.

14:55.928 --> 15:01.274
It has nothing to do with sex.

15:01.299 --> 15:06.688
Animals are more sex-conscious than you are;
are they going to get evolution before you

15:06.688 --> 15:07.688
get?

15:07.688 --> 15:13.488
Moreover, the whole thing that is worked out
in such a way that we have started having

15:13.488 --> 15:18.588
the sex through our mental activity, which
is a wrong thing.

15:18.588 --> 15:25.931
Christ has said, “Thou shalt not have adultery,
thy should not commit adultery.

15:25.962 --> 15:32.047
But I say, I say verily to you, ‘Thou shalt
not have adulterous eyes.’

15:32.258 --> 15:39.328
Because He knew this would happen one day
that the sex would move from there to the

15:39.328 --> 15:46.048
Swadisthana Chakra – the second chakra by
which we think – and then it will come into

15:46.048 --> 15:50.168
our thinking and our eyes will start roving
around.

15:50.168 --> 15:58.258
And then, actually the sex act minimizes,
and it becomes a big problem; I mean to be

15:58.283 --> 16:00.927
a sex point itself becomes an achievement
for people then.

16:01.090 --> 16:03.938
It’s such an absurd thing to do.

16:03.938 --> 16:08.778
And this is what is a very big confusion today
in the modern times.

16:08.778 --> 16:13.428
I mean, you cannot make compromises with Christ;
what He said is absolute.

16:13.428 --> 16:23.217
But unless and until you understand that sex
as a married life, as a private thing, is

16:23.217 --> 16:32.657
the one that has been sanctioned for our sustenance,
for our sustenance as human beings; that has

16:32.657 --> 16:39.597
to be looked after, is to be respected, is
sacred.

16:39.598 --> 16:44.188
And that’s why anything else that we try
to do, all kinds of perversions and these

16:44.188 --> 16:50.938
things – you won’t believe that all kinds
of perversions come to us because we are no

16:50.938 --> 16:51.978
more there.

16:51.978 --> 16:54.628
Mostly we get possessed.

16:54.628 --> 17:01.958
We had one boy who came to us in New York
and he told me, “Mother, I…

17:01.958 --> 17:07.418
I’m a man, I have moustaches and everything
but I want to be like a woman.

17:07.418 --> 17:10.578
I want to be dressed up like a woman,” and
he talked like a woman.

17:10.578 --> 17:14.148
He said, “I want to walk like a woman, I
don’t know what to do with myself.

17:14.148 --> 17:15.428
I am so confused.

17:15.428 --> 17:20.968
And I cannot have any relationship with any
woman because she gets confused with me also.

17:20.968 --> 17:24.738
And I don’t know what is happening to me,
why I want to be like this.”

17:24.738 --> 17:29.348
And I could see he was possessed by a woman.

17:29.348 --> 17:32.788
He was just possessed by a woman, simple thing
as that.

17:32.788 --> 17:36.508
Very simple, it is extremely simple.

17:36.508 --> 17:42.998
And when that possession was removed, he said,
“I am a man again.”

17:43.239 --> 17:45.335
Is so simple, in one day.

17:45.360 --> 17:52.308
He is a different man altogether today, absolutely
a different personality, and it can happen

17:52.308 --> 17:54.068
to a woman.

17:54.068 --> 18:00.448
We had somebody from Australia and she got
possessed by a man and she started talking

18:00.448 --> 18:04.340
like that and behavior, the whole thing, her
husband got frightened, and he couldn’t

18:04.365 --> 18:06.938
understand what’s gone wrong with this lady.

18:07.211 --> 18:13.508
And the whole attitude, the whole beauty of
a woman was lost into the style of a man,

18:13.508 --> 18:17.108
and it was so funny and odd to look at.

18:17.108 --> 18:21.678
Same thing: she came to Sahaj Yoga and the
spirit ran away.

18:21.678 --> 18:27.228
She is a beautiful woman now, extremely beautiful,
and they’re having a very good relationship.

18:27.228 --> 18:34.978
So when you try to do anything perverted with
the sex and do not respect it, you do not

18:34.978 --> 18:37.598
know what things are awaiting us around.

18:37.598 --> 18:44.468
So before I go to other chakras, I want to
tell you about our other unknown areas which

18:44.468 --> 18:48.758
are very important to us and then we’ll
go to the second chakra.

18:48.758 --> 18:55.028
As you see here on the left hand side this
blue line is there.

18:55.028 --> 19:05.317
This blue line is our power of desire by which
we desire, by which God has – supposing

19:05.317 --> 19:09.028
this is the primordial being because God has
made you in His own image – supposing it

19:09.028 --> 19:13.318
is the image of God, then it is His desire.

19:13.318 --> 19:21.268
This power of desire gives you existence,
and when this desire is over, when the Spirit,

19:21.268 --> 19:28.468
which is watching the drama of this body,
gets fed up, it disappears, then the death

19:28.468 --> 19:29.968
comes in.

19:29.968 --> 19:32.528
This power of desire is the left side.

19:32.528 --> 19:41.108
We call it in Sanskrit as Ida Nadi, also called
as the Moon Nadi and in the Hatha Yoga is

19:41.108 --> 19:42.238
the Tha Nadi.

19:42.238 --> 19:45.048
This is the channel, is a subtle channel.

19:45.048 --> 19:51.418
But this gives rise to the gross channel,
which is the left sympathetic nervous system.

19:51.418 --> 19:55.218
Now, doctors don’t believe that left and
right sympathetic nervous systems are two

19:55.218 --> 19:59.738
different, but you will find out yourself
that they are very different.

19:59.738 --> 20:08.643
This looks after our emotional side, and also
beyond this lies the area which is unknown

20:08.668 --> 20:11.608
to us, is the subconscious; it is unknown
to us.

20:11.608 --> 20:15.688
Whatever is unknown is not God, is not from
God’s area.

20:15.688 --> 20:22.438
It is an unknown area, and beyond that subconscious
area, lies the collective subconscious – all

20:22.438 --> 20:27.668
that has died from our creation.

20:27.668 --> 20:38.519
Recently I was seeing one of the series on
cancer, in London on the television, and they

20:38.519 --> 20:44.848
told that they have discovered some sort of
proteins, which they call as protein 58 and

20:44.848 --> 20:52.127
56 and all that, they have given names, which
they have also photographed – enter into

20:52.159 --> 21:00.714
our being from areas which are built within
us, from unknown areas – they do not know

21:00.739 --> 21:05.394
if they are known areas – which are built
within us since our creation.

21:05.419 --> 21:10.088
Now, I’ve told this about ten years back
in America before.

21:10.838 --> 21:15.705
And they trigger the happening of cancer,
they trigger it.

21:15.908 --> 21:21.536
So it is from the collective subconscious
this attack comes in.

21:21.732 --> 21:28.168
So if you move to the left side, you move
to the collective subconscious too much and

21:28.168 --> 21:30.978
then all kinds of things can happen to you.

21:30.978 --> 21:37.858
For example, first of all you start getting
shaking, you start hearing voices, you start

21:37.858 --> 21:43.148
feeling that you are losing your body; you
are going on top of some place and seeing

21:43.148 --> 21:44.148
things.

21:44.148 --> 21:46.358
Is all these spirits are doing.

21:46.358 --> 21:52.788
Now it has reached such a serious state, that
in Switzerland I found that many children

21:52.788 --> 21:57.538
were killed because of this action.

21:57.538 --> 22:04.148
The mother is, supposing, with some clairvoyant
lady or somebody who is doing this spiritual

22:04.148 --> 22:05.148
work.

22:05.148 --> 22:06.148
Is a very dangerous thing.

22:06.148 --> 22:08.908
One should never take to this kind of a thing.

22:08.908 --> 22:12.767
If you take to these things, then seven generations
suffer.

22:12.792 --> 22:17.478
Today only I had a girl who told Me that her
mother was a clairvoyant, and all her life

22:17.478 --> 22:22.862
she was miserable with her husband and this
girl has been always crying and weeping and

22:22.887 --> 22:24.978
she cannot conceive or something like that.

22:24.978 --> 22:29.478
Is a very serious thing, one should never
go into these unknown areas of the collective

22:29.478 --> 22:35.355
subconscious and worry about the dead and
control them and look after them and call

22:35.380 --> 22:35.857
them.

22:35.882 --> 22:38.881
You must give them their freedom.

22:39.198 --> 22:42.988
Is a very dangerous area into which you enter.

22:42.988 --> 22:47.847
I hope you don’t mind it, I have to tell
you the truth, I am your Mother, and I have

22:47.872 --> 22:51.668
to tell you the truth: that you should be
very careful about this kind of thing like

22:51.668 --> 22:57.188
psychics or the people who try to say that
“You can get possessed.”

22:57.188 --> 23:00.598
They will not say, they say, “It is, it
is–” They can even say, “This is Holy

23:00.598 --> 23:01.384
Ghost.”

23:01.409 --> 23:02.918
They can say anything.

23:02.918 --> 23:08.658
But in whatever way, when you find that you
are not in control of the situation, that

23:08.658 --> 23:11.478
means you are not there.

23:11.478 --> 23:17.208
Is very simple as that, supposing your car
is driving and suddenly it goes into a khadd

23:17.208 --> 23:18.418
[pit – ED.].

23:18.418 --> 23:23.478
Now, do you think that you have achieved a
greater progress by that?

23:23.478 --> 23:27.238
It’s just you have moved without your control.

23:27.238 --> 23:32.597
If you have no control upon yourself …If
somebody sitting down and he starts jumping

23:32.597 --> 23:39.788
– automatically, he cannot control his jumping
– then it is not himself, minimum of minimum.

23:39.788 --> 23:43.088
Whatever he is, even that control is lost.

23:43.088 --> 23:50.948
Anything, any such happening which is beyond
your control means that you are enslaved by

23:50.948 --> 23:52.712
one of these possessions.

23:52.737 --> 23:55.458
But they are never satisfied with what they
do to you.

23:55.458 --> 24:00.378
I mean like I’ll tell you one of the very
startling example of this left side.

24:00.378 --> 24:07.238
In London we have – I don’t know now if
they have but we had – a center called,

24:07.238 --> 24:09.968
“Late Dr. Laing’s International Curative
Center.”

24:09.968 --> 24:17.328
I didn’t know about it, but a lady came
to Me in India to tell Me about this.

24:17.328 --> 24:23.968
She said she had some problem with her stomach
and she wrote to this organization saying

24:23.968 --> 24:28.108
that “Please, help me to get cured.”

24:28.108 --> 24:32.268
And they wrote back saying that “At five
o’clock on such-and-such date, we’ll enter

24:32.399 --> 24:33.820
into your body.”

24:33.845 --> 24:37.798
I mean they were honest, I must say, as English
people are honest sometimes.

24:37.798 --> 24:42.198
So he was honest to say that “We’ll enter
into your body, some of the doctors are there

24:42.198 --> 24:45.508
who will enter into your body, and they’ll
cure you.”

24:45.508 --> 24:51.258
But afterwards, after five years the lady
was rattling, rattling just like a junkie

24:51.258 --> 24:52.258
car.

24:52.258 --> 24:56.271
And she came to Me and then she gave Me the
history of this, which I verified.

24:56.296 --> 25:03.068
The Dr. Laing, the Dr. Laing, the one, the
one who is the one who is supposed to be running,

25:03.068 --> 25:04.988
is late, he’s dead.

25:04.988 --> 25:14.378
He entered into a soldier in Vietnam, an American,
and told him that “You go and talk to my

25:14.378 --> 25:19.008
son and tell him that I have entered into
you and that you should start such and such

25:19.008 --> 25:20.008
organization.”

25:20.008 --> 25:25.868
Now this soldier has never done anything,
I mean he has never seen a scalpel also, he

25:25.868 --> 25:28.218
doesn’t know how to operate, no question.

25:28.218 --> 25:34.258
This soldier went to the son and told him,
and he told him certain secrets which convinced

25:34.258 --> 25:38.268
the boy and they started that organization.

25:38.268 --> 25:42.008
This organization went on like this.

25:42.008 --> 25:47.908
And this soldier, of all the persons, used
to do the operation, you see it’s called

25:47.908 --> 25:51.608
“psychic operation,” all sorts of things
and he had never seen anything and he used

25:51.608 --> 25:57.438
to be possessed by this man and he did it.

25:57.438 --> 26:00.438
But why didn’t he go to his son directly?

26:00.438 --> 26:04.628
Because he knew about the dangers.

26:04.628 --> 26:11.398
And the same son will end up – I am sure,
hundred percent, the same gentleman who is

26:11.398 --> 26:15.868
operating and the son – with some trouble,
which is of a very serious nature.

26:15.868 --> 26:20.905
Because never play with the fire which is
the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

26:21.218 --> 26:23.852
You have to be in the present and not in the
past.

26:23.960 --> 26:28.560
Now the people who think too much about their
past, “What was my previous life?”

26:28.585 --> 26:29.810
Why should you worry?

26:29.835 --> 26:33.988
Whatever it was is better today because you
can get realization today.

26:33.988 --> 26:39.418
You could not get realization even if you
were the King of Egypt, what does it matter?

26:39.418 --> 26:44.623
You couldn’t get your realization that day,
so why worry about the past?

26:44.709 --> 26:48.298
All the time worrying about the past or playing
with your emotions, you see.

26:48.298 --> 26:53.098
Like we had one gentleman, who used to always
cry and weep too much and his mother sent

26:53.098 --> 26:57.128
him to Me, and I asked him, “What did you
do all your life?”

26:57.128 --> 27:00.668
He said, “I was very fond of Lord Byron
and I just read him.”

27:00.668 --> 27:02.968
I said, “All right, that’s it.”

27:02.968 --> 27:08.598
This Lord Byron, he led such a horrible life
himself, an unholy person, and made everybody

27:08.598 --> 27:09.598
cry,

27:09.598 --> 27:12.108
“You suffer, you must suffer, you must weep.”

27:12.133 --> 27:13.657
Why should you suffer?

27:13.962 --> 27:23.023
The idea of a saint is that a person who is
absolutely in bones, walking like a TB patient,

27:23.023 --> 27:24.693
is a saint.

27:24.693 --> 27:26.923
I mean is something sadistic, I can’t see
Christ.

27:26.923 --> 27:31.873
I was so happy to see that you showed Him
as a resurrection, that is His message.

27:31.873 --> 27:34.013
Is resurrection is His message.

27:34.013 --> 27:39.465
Crucifixion is just a means but resurrection
is the thing.

27:39.536 --> 27:43.256
And the lanky-panky stuff, walking like a
saint, how can that be?

27:43.256 --> 27:51.646
Is it possible, a person who is bestowed with
God’s blessing has to be a healthy, cheerful

27:51.646 --> 27:54.056
and a very happy person, has to be that.

27:54.056 --> 28:00.226
Minimum of minimum should be that, and I was
happy to see even Mr. Paulsen here, who was

28:00.226 --> 28:04.306
very healthy and this thing I said, “Now,
this is a religious place because wherever

28:04.306 --> 28:09.327
I go I find such serious and absolutely sickly
people.”

28:10.247 --> 28:18.854
So the people who believe in sufferings, like…
the Jews they denied Christ.

28:18.879 --> 28:20.244
Why?

28:20.556 --> 28:22.636
Because He was a Jew.

28:22.636 --> 28:25.593
Is absolutely true about human nature.

28:26.007 --> 28:29.266
If I was an American, you would not have accepted
Me.

28:29.266 --> 28:36.036
In India the Indian Christians, in whose community
I was born, have not accepted Me at all.

28:36.036 --> 28:37.226
Can you imagine?

28:37.226 --> 28:43.046
I have got Muslim disciples, Hindus, I’ve
got Parsis and Sikhs, but hardly one or two

28:43.046 --> 28:45.096
and maybe My family people.

28:45.096 --> 28:47.116
They have not accepted Me.

28:47.116 --> 28:51.115
They didn’t accept Christ, and because they
didn’t accept they couldn’t accept that

28:51.140 --> 28:52.140
He suffered for us.

28:53.193 --> 28:54.533
Why should we suffer?

28:54.533 --> 28:59.973
Has He suffered less for you any way: has
He left some for you to suffer?

28:59.973 --> 29:04.113
So, you want to suffer, all right have Hitler
and suffer?

29:07.070 --> 29:08.410
That’s it!

29:08.410 --> 29:08.950
Have him!

29:08.975 --> 29:10.057
If you enjoy suffering, why not?

29:10.118 --> 29:12.518
And it started like that.

29:12.552 --> 29:17.522
Actually when Hitler came, for eleven years,
you will be amazed, eleven years, these people

29:17.522 --> 29:20.402
were supposed to be suffering you among themselves,
you see?

29:20.402 --> 29:26.672
In France if you go today people are sitting
outside and they are talking of their sufferings

29:26.672 --> 29:29.052
and money and other nonsensical things.

29:29.052 --> 29:34.362
They are waiting for the day, they said that
that in ‘82 in any case we are going to

29:34.362 --> 29:38.544
be finished, waiting for– they discussing
it very nicely.

29:38.569 --> 29:42.593
Les Miserables I call them, as they are.

29:42.691 --> 29:47.562
So why should you suffer, I just can’t understand,
when Christ has suffered for you?

29:47.562 --> 29:50.642
Only He’s to be awakened within us.

29:50.642 --> 29:56.792
If He’s awakened, He takes away all our
sufferings, all our conditionings, all our

29:56.792 --> 30:00.948
so-called karmas and everything, which I will
show you later on how it works out.

30:01.026 --> 30:03.976
So now we come to the left side then to the
right side.

30:03.976 --> 30:11.756
Right side is the action, the power of action,
is the Surya Nadi, is the channel of the sun.

30:12.084 --> 30:22.831
When you want to enact your desire, manifest
it, then you use this action power, Iccha

30:22.856 --> 30:24.614
Shakti is called in Sanskrit.

30:24.747 --> 30:30.662
Now this power works mainly through this second
center, or we call it the third center, actually

30:30.687 --> 30:33.096
it is the third because the second one is
that.

30:33.096 --> 30:42.687
This center is called as Swadisthana and this
center has got six, you can see six plexuses,

30:42.712 --> 30:44.756
it’s like the Star of David.

30:44.756 --> 30:53.365
Moses preached something, and Jews are doing
something else.

30:53.396 --> 30:58.376
Christ preached something, and Christians
are doing something else.

30:58.376 --> 31:02.766
Adi Shankaracharya taught something, and Hindus
are doing just the opposite.

31:03.367 --> 31:06.398
Mohammed taught something, and they did just
the opposite.

31:06.507 --> 31:10.883
It’s not only in religion, in every way
you see how we are perverted.

31:10.908 --> 31:21.660
Like this center is used for converting the
fat in your stomach for the use of your brain.

31:21.685 --> 31:25.036
Nor do we realize that our brain is made of
fat.

31:25.083 --> 31:28.324
Do we know all our nerves are made of fat.

31:28.349 --> 31:33.284
Now there’s a general principle in this
country that you should not use any butter,

31:33.309 --> 31:35.176
which is very wrong.

31:36.543 --> 31:41.982
When you don’t use any butter how are you
going to supply this brain with something,

31:42.007 --> 31:44.136
I mean where will you get, it’s completely
drained out.

31:44.136 --> 31:53.190
You use your brain so much, so much so, that
this poor center has to work only for your

31:53.215 --> 31:55.536
thinking which has no productivity.

31:55.576 --> 31:59.908
You just go on thinking, thinking, thinking,
thinking; two horns come out of your head

31:59.933 --> 32:04.987
of thinking; still you are thinking, and they
go on growing, you cannot stop your thinking.

32:05.012 --> 32:09.190
And what are you thinking, what have you got
out of your thinking?

32:09.330 --> 32:17.987
This right side is the one which is our five
elements also, five elements within us.

32:18.026 --> 32:27.384
So when we started discovering what is the
essence of the five elements, in India we

32:27.409 --> 32:32.747
started the Vedas thousands of years back,
and the effect of that is shown now, is the

32:32.772 --> 32:35.408
science, you discovered, the science.

32:35.433 --> 32:39.422
That you understood how to master these five
elements.

32:39.422 --> 32:41.062
But what did you do with it?

32:41.062 --> 32:44.062
You created bombs; horrible bombs you have
created.

32:44.320 --> 32:48.002
You have created these devils and now you
are frightened of them.

32:48.002 --> 32:49.241
Thank God.

32:49.241 --> 32:55.462
That’s something good that all such ventures
stop by themselves because you create a bomb,

32:55.462 --> 32:57.272
it becomes a devil on top of your head.

32:57.272 --> 33:02.082
Now you can’t start war because as soon
as you start means no more existence.

33:02.082 --> 33:06.272
So you are frightened and that is how – where
have we gone to?

33:06.272 --> 33:10.752
Science has led us to which sensible things,
we should think.

33:10.752 --> 33:17.242
For example science has given us all these
devices by which our life can be made very

33:17.242 --> 33:18.592
easy.

33:18.592 --> 33:23.662
We can have more time, we can have much more
time than our forefathers had, who had to

33:23.662 --> 33:29.651
do everything with their own hands and go
about it, but here, you see, everything is

33:29.651 --> 33:30.651
instant.

33:30.651 --> 33:31.911
I mean anything: You want to have food?

33:31.912 --> 33:35.100
All right you have instant, everything is
made instant.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.550
But for what is it instant, is to save time.

33:38.551 --> 33:43.622
Now we have watches also here to save time,
everybody’s saving time, saving time, everybody

33:43.622 --> 33:44.872
“busy” saving time.

33:44.872 --> 33:48.350
But what are you doing about the saved time?

33:48.350 --> 33:49.350
What do we do with it?

33:49.350 --> 33:54.041
For example there was a gentleman coming from
India, very busy man, “Very busy, there’s

33:54.042 --> 33:56.242
no time to talk to anyone.”

33:56.242 --> 33:59.880
And I said, “Wanna, why are you in such
a great hurry to go?”

33:59.905 --> 34:02.180
“Oh, you don’t know!

34:02.461 --> 34:03.883
I have very important –“

34:03.908 --> 34:04.608
“What?”

34:04.633 --> 34:07.796
“I have to attend a particular ball for
five hours there.”

34:07.821 --> 34:08.821
“Very good.

34:08.821 --> 34:10.541
Is that the way you are going to save?”

34:10.541 --> 34:15.842
“And then I have to attend a racecourse,
I have to do this, I have to do that.”

34:15.842 --> 34:19.375
This is no saving of time; this is the real
waste of time.

34:19.493 --> 34:24.662
Real waste of time is this way we do it, and
how are we going to save our time?

34:24.662 --> 34:32.122
Time is to be saved to be realized, to be
in meditation, to enjoy the beauties of God.

34:32.122 --> 34:37.582
That’s why these all things are given to
us, and that’s how we should look at them.

34:37.582 --> 34:39.632
But now we have become their slaves.

34:39.632 --> 34:46.702
When we achieve something, for example electricity,
it is so important to New York that one day

34:46.702 --> 34:49.418
it stopped, the whole thing stopped.

34:49.443 --> 34:51.812
So we become also slaves to these.

34:51.812 --> 34:56.172
Apart from that, now we have no time, we are
so busy.

34:56.172 --> 34:57.172
I don’t know.

34:57.172 --> 35:00.461
I thought that here people will have more
time than we have in India because, you see,

35:00.461 --> 35:06.501
if you have to travel we have very funny trains,
and we have not yet developed as you people

35:06.501 --> 35:07.501
are.

35:07.501 --> 35:10.251
Sometimes I have to go to villages in bullock
carts and this and this.

35:10.251 --> 35:12.261
But people have no time.

35:12.261 --> 35:17.231
This is the trouble in these countries, you
have no time at all and I don’t know what

35:17.231 --> 35:19.902
constructive work they are doing for themselves.

35:19.902 --> 35:22.572
So this is what is the right side where we
go wrong.

35:22.572 --> 35:27.551
But the worst thing we do is to think.

35:27.551 --> 35:34.051
We think all the time, and what do we think?

35:34.051 --> 35:37.072
Either we think of aggression or we think
of recession.

35:37.072 --> 35:41.342
For example we think that, “Oh, we are guilty.”

35:41.342 --> 35:47.281
You do something and then you sit down, “Oh,
I should not have done it, this is very wrong

35:47.281 --> 35:53.352
I should not have done it,” and you start
wondering about it, correcting about it.

35:53.352 --> 35:59.312
But actual correction is not there, actual
correction is not there, only by thinking

35:59.312 --> 36:01.092
you avoid the main issue.

36:01.092 --> 36:07.011
You have to be in the present but thinking
can only take you to the left or to the right,

36:07.011 --> 36:08.421
to the past or to the present.

36:08.421 --> 36:09.421
[future – ED?]

36:09.421 --> 36:14.732
You cannot be at the state where you become
just yourself, there’s no thought.

36:14.732 --> 36:19.902
There is no mental activity at all, you just
become.

36:19.902 --> 36:24.772
Because a thought rises like this and falls
off, another thought rises like that and falls

36:24.772 --> 36:28.761
off, in between them is a very little space
which is the present.

36:28.761 --> 36:34.622
So the past comes to the future and becomes,
again the future comes in and again becomes

36:34.622 --> 36:35.812
the past like that.

36:35.812 --> 36:40.668
But in between is the present and that present
is very small.

36:40.693 --> 36:47.162
Unless and until you know how to stay in that
present, you will be always tossing on these

36:47.162 --> 36:53.531
waves of past and future while past is finished
and future doesn’t exist.

36:53.531 --> 36:56.142
You plan out something, it – all plans goes
out.

36:56.142 --> 36:59.529
You plan anything but how can you plan also,
I can’t understand.

36:59.554 --> 37:05.761
Supposing you don’t know the way, and you
plan that, “I will go right and left.”

37:05.761 --> 37:09.408
Now supposing you are going to the right and
left is the sea, will you jump in the sea?

37:09.900 --> 37:16.801
Anything that you have to do new, you cannot
plan it out, you have to keep it just open,

37:16.801 --> 37:22.342
like a seed when it sprouts, it has got a
living cell at its tip.

37:22.342 --> 37:26.691
It goes and sees for itself how it has to
move.

37:26.691 --> 37:30.466
When there is hardness, it moves round the
hardness, when there is softness, it moves

37:30.491 --> 37:31.615
like that.

37:31.640 --> 37:37.741
So when we plan everything we really become
rigid, and like – I heard of a person who

37:37.741 --> 37:39.531
planned everything for his picnic.

37:39.531 --> 37:45.652
He had all champagne and everything put together
and when he reached the place he had no bottle

37:45.652 --> 37:47.362
opener and he had to break the bottles.

37:47.362 --> 37:49.092
That’s what it is.

37:49.092 --> 37:54.530
Sometimes the planning can be such a headache,
I mean, you waste one hour in planning and

37:54.555 --> 37:59.191
while it comes to reality you find it’s
all wrong, it doesn’t work out.

37:59.191 --> 38:04.892
So too much planning, like I have to go supposing
to Los Angeles, I have to book My ticket,

38:04.892 --> 38:06.271
this is today, I have to do it today.

38:06.271 --> 38:10.632
I don’t have to sit down and plan that on
such and such date I’ll go and book it.

38:10.632 --> 38:14.731
So in the present if you know how to live,
but this cannot be done by saying that “You

38:14.731 --> 38:15.731
live in present.”

38:15.731 --> 38:20.072
It cannot be done, I know because that’s
not some sort of a thing that can be taught.

38:20.072 --> 38:22.597
It has to happen to you, you have to become
that.

38:22.622 --> 38:28.261
Once you become that, then you become thoughtlessly
aware.

38:28.261 --> 38:30.462
You become a witness.

38:30.462 --> 38:34.237
You see the whole show as a drama, and you
don’t get involved into it.

38:34.370 --> 38:36.771
You just see the waves coming up and going
down.

38:36.771 --> 38:43.082
Like, I can say, you are standing in the water,
and there are waves around and you are frightened,

38:43.082 --> 38:46.692
but if you are put in the boat you start seeing
those things.

38:46.692 --> 38:50.001
If you know how to swim you can enjoy those
waves.

38:50.001 --> 38:56.062
In the same way when you become a master,
when you come in the boat in the state of

38:56.062 --> 38:59.572
thoughtless awareness then you start seeing
these things and the whole thing appears like

38:59.572 --> 39:00.572
a drama.

39:00.572 --> 39:05.342
Actually the whole thing is a drama but the
drama must end for you to see that it’s

39:05.342 --> 39:11.261
just a drama and you are unnecessarily worried
about it, and by worry, you know for definite

39:11.261 --> 39:12.531
nothing works out.

39:12.531 --> 39:15.952
But if I say, “Don’t worry,” you’ll
worry more, that’s not the way.

39:15.952 --> 39:18.261
That’s not the way.

39:18.261 --> 39:22.041
They all tried these tricks to say, “Don’t
do that and don’t do that,” it never worked.

39:22.041 --> 39:24.033
With human beings it doesn’t work out.

39:24.058 --> 39:27.261
It’s all right with animals, you can work
it out, but with human beings, if you tell

39:27.261 --> 39:29.312
them, “Don’t,” they’ll do it ten time.

39:29.312 --> 39:33.072
So best is to so make them that.

39:33.072 --> 39:37.322
Unless and until they are made the spirit
it’s impossible to convince a modern man

39:37.347 --> 39:38.760
to do something.

39:38.854 --> 39:44.781
So is best is first let them have their realization,
let them have their light, let them see for

39:44.781 --> 39:48.312
themselves what’s the problem, let them
feel it and correct it.

39:48.312 --> 39:52.592
It’s let them judge themselves, that is
the best way is to do it, and that’s the

39:52.592 --> 40:00.342
time has come for you to have it and see for
yourself and be able to discriminate between

40:00.342 --> 40:03.452
false and reality.

40:03.452 --> 40:12.671
Now this side beyond is the supraconscious
area, and beyond this is the collective supraconscious.

40:12.671 --> 40:22.301
Now if you take LSD, for example you take
LSD, you go onto supraconscious area.

40:23.479 --> 40:30.465
I was surprised when I went to Colombia, I
asked them, they had a condor as their emblem

40:30.490 --> 40:34.972
for navy, and I said, “How condor is your
emblem?” because condor has nothing to do

40:34.972 --> 40:36.171
with the navy.

40:36.171 --> 40:42.678
They said, “Our old Indians have told us
that a God called Shri Vishnu,” just see

40:42.703 --> 40:45.476
the name, “came on a condor.”

40:45.501 --> 40:48.082
And really condor is the conveyance of Vishnu.

40:48.082 --> 40:49.761
Can you imagine?

40:49.761 --> 40:51.911
I was amazed at this.

40:51.911 --> 40:56.171
How did these people in thousands of years
backs saw, but then I said, “What were they

40:56.171 --> 40:58.622
doing normally, what was their pastime?”

40:58.622 --> 41:08.461
And they showed Me a thing made out of a shell
of a fruit and with a little stirring rod

41:08.461 --> 41:09.971
in it.

41:09.971 --> 41:10.981
I said, “What is this?”

41:10.981 --> 41:12.742
They said, “They used to make some sort
of a amrose.”

41:12.742 --> 41:14.511
“Oh, I see, that’s it.”

41:14.511 --> 41:20.051
And even today Peru is exporting that amrose
to you which is nothing but LSD.

41:20.051 --> 41:25.942
If you take things like that, of that nature,
of LSD nature, you go to the right side.

41:25.942 --> 41:28.511
You move to your supraconscious area.

41:28.511 --> 41:30.582
Means you get disintegrated.

41:30.582 --> 41:35.281
In the morning I told you that when you are
integrated you don’t see any auras or anything

41:35.281 --> 41:36.281
around the person.

41:36.281 --> 41:40.092
When you are disintegrated, only then you
see because you become these five elements.

41:40.092 --> 41:43.632
When you are integrated you don’t see anything.

41:43.632 --> 41:49.541
And then you start seeing these things, like
an eye and a light, and all those things you

41:49.541 --> 41:56.011
start seeing, and if you go further, further
with it into supraconscious areas, you can

41:56.011 --> 42:01.541
become horribly possessed by the people who
have been ambitious.

42:01.541 --> 42:03.991
Even Hitler can possess you.

42:03.991 --> 42:05.461
Hitler did that.

42:05.461 --> 42:08.892
Hitler did all supraconscious activity in
Germany.

42:08.892 --> 42:12.382
How he possessed people was through supraconscious.

42:12.382 --> 42:17.382
Because in the supraconscious, collective
supraconscious, there are many ambitious people

42:17.382 --> 42:18.521
who have died.

42:18.521 --> 42:24.392
Like Gauguin was an ambitious man, but he
became mad, I don’t know how he became mad.

42:24.392 --> 42:28.911
Normally an ambitious man doesn’t become
mad he makes everyone mad, but he doesn’t

42:28.911 --> 42:29.911
become himself.

42:29.911 --> 42:34.671
But this fellow was possessed, and we saw
it in the television that a man who was possessed

42:34.671 --> 42:36.943
by this Gauguin was painting just like him.

42:36.943 --> 42:40.582
I know – you see Gauguin’s paintings,
that you must be knowing also that in one

42:40.582 --> 42:44.652
line he puts lots of color and he was doing
it very fast.

42:44.652 --> 42:46.961
And he said, “I’m possessed by Gauguin.”

42:46.961 --> 42:51.812
So these ambitious people, like some of the
ambitious people could be doctors, could be

42:51.812 --> 42:59.961
mathematicians, can be physicians or anything
like that, they can possess.

42:59.961 --> 43:06.912
I know of a lady, she is a unique mathematician
and she’s possessed, definitely possessed.

43:06.912 --> 43:10.853
And she can tell you anything you ask her,
any square root, anything she can tell you,

43:11.158 --> 43:14.943
and she’s earning lot of money out of it
but she’s always sick, she has a headache.

43:15.029 --> 43:18.175
She came to Me for curing, I said, “You
have to give up this nonsense.”

43:18.378 --> 43:21.008
She said, “Let me make sufficient money,
then I’ll give up.”

43:21.033 --> 43:25.905
I said, “By that time I may not be there.”

43:25.930 --> 43:30.372
So these things can happen to you with the
supraconscious activity and this awareness

43:30.372 --> 43:33.852
of supraconscious is also very dangerous.

43:33.852 --> 43:39.671
The trouble is if you suffer from the superego
there, from this side, with the conditionings,

43:39.671 --> 43:41.501
you suffer.

43:41.501 --> 43:46.501
I mean you get the pains all over the body,
you might feel sick, you will cry and weep,

43:46.501 --> 43:49.642
you’ll be unhappy, it troubles you.

43:49.642 --> 43:54.702
But when you are possessed by this ego business,
as it is ego is too much, and then if you

43:54.702 --> 44:01.232
get possessed by somebody egoistical, then
God save that person and God save all the

44:01.232 --> 44:05.792
relations, because such a person you cannot
even talk, he’s so aggressive, he’s so

44:05.792 --> 44:14.132
aggressive, he will aggress all the other
people ultimately he himself becomes absolutely

44:14.132 --> 44:16.066
stupid fool.

44:16.091 --> 44:21.961
Many people whom we think are very successful
in life, really are stupid; if you look at

44:21.986 --> 44:23.766
them they are really stupid people.

44:23.791 --> 44:30.267
Like we can say, this Kennedy’s… a man,
what was his name is, whom she married –

44:30.292 --> 44:31.267
Man: Onasis

44:31.292 --> 44:34.372
Shri Mataji: He was a stupid fool, I have
met him.

44:34.372 --> 44:37.862
I met him; he was a real fool I tell you.

44:37.862 --> 44:41.842
I don’t know how this woman married him
and she must be another stupid fool to marry

44:41.842 --> 44:42.842
him.

44:42.842 --> 44:43.842
Both must be foolish.

44:43.842 --> 44:47.991
Actually I met him very well, because My husband
is with the shipping, and I don’t know how

44:47.991 --> 44:52.214
could she marry this old man like her grandfather
and what was the thing?

44:52.239 --> 44:57.572
Maybe money part or whatever it was, I mean
it’s so stupid, the whole thing is so stupid.

44:57.572 --> 45:01.832
And this stupidity you can see, even it grows
with your age more and more, and you become

45:01.832 --> 45:04.062
more stupid.

45:04.062 --> 45:08.112
Like an eighty-year-old woman writing love
letters to an eighteen-year-old boy.

45:08.112 --> 45:09.112
It’s stupidity.

45:09.112 --> 45:13.922
Is absolute stupidity, I tell you, if you
see it from wisdom point of view.

45:13.922 --> 45:18.832
One can’t understand an old man, who is
like a great-grandfather, writing a love letter

45:18.832 --> 45:24.112
to a little girl of eighteen years or an old
woman, who could be a great-great-great-grandmother

45:24.112 --> 45:27.156
writing to a little boy like that, it’s
absurd.

45:28.384 --> 45:33.577
And they are so stupid and they talk like
this, “I believe in this.”

45:33.602 --> 45:37.944
Of course all the donkeys believe like that,
so there’s nothing new about it.

45:37.968 --> 45:41.823
But they are so starringly stupid that you
are amazed, you know.

45:41.849 --> 45:44.988
You start looking at them, “What’s the
matter with them?”

45:45.033 --> 45:50.112
This is the blessing of this mister ego, which
exists in the head sometimes goes up like

45:50.112 --> 45:57.863
a balloon, but you start seeing it, you start
seeing it when you get your realization.

45:57.863 --> 46:06.962
I had a disciple, one of My sons, who came
to Me and one day he said, “Mother, I’m

46:06.987 --> 46:08.311
really frightened with one idea.”

46:08.336 --> 46:09.322
I Said, “What is it?”

46:09.322 --> 46:11.096
“But You don’t tell me if it is true.”

46:11.121 --> 46:12.080
I said, “What is it?”

46:12.105 --> 46:15.146
He said, “Was I Napoleon in my last life?”

46:15.193 --> 46:17.233
I said, “What makes you think like that?”

46:17.233 --> 46:21.672
“Because I can see such a big ego on my
head, this could be only Napoleon and I know

46:21.672 --> 46:22.672
how to draw.

46:22.672 --> 46:27.132
These two things put together, could I have
been Napoleon, but if I was You don’t tell

46:27.132 --> 46:30.693
me otherwise I may commit suicide” – even
after realization.

46:30.693 --> 46:34.652
So it is ego becomes then a headache to us.

46:34.652 --> 46:38.473
It becomes a headache and we want to get rid
of it.

46:38.473 --> 46:44.592
We start seeing it, and it presses you, you
get a headache and you feel it in the Agnya,

46:44.592 --> 46:47.033
how it troubles you.

46:47.033 --> 46:50.803
Then it starts troubling you – not others
so much as it troubles you – because you

46:50.803 --> 46:53.652
don’t want to accept that you are egoistical,
you start seeing it.

46:53.652 --> 46:57.852
But you don’t say that you have a ego, you
will come and tell Me, “Mother I’ve got

46:57.852 --> 47:00.283
an Agnya catching,” and we have to clear
that Agnya.

47:00.283 --> 47:03.453
Nobody feels bad about it because you are
separated from yourself.

47:03.453 --> 47:09.092
You don’t feel that you are hurt or insulted
because you get separated, and you see for

47:09.092 --> 47:10.092
yourself.

47:10.092 --> 47:14.724
Like this sari has some sort of a black spot
on it, so I see it, I take it out, and then

47:14.724 --> 47:18.303
I want to wash it, I don’t want to keep
it black; I am not identified with it.

47:18.303 --> 47:23.703
So all these fixations also drop out when
you get realized, because you go in the center,

47:23.703 --> 47:25.473
not on the left or to the right.

47:25.473 --> 47:36.003
Now movement on the right, actually is the
blessing of this center, in the center, because

47:36.003 --> 47:43.382
the central line is this line of our evolution,
is the line of sustenance, is the line by

47:43.382 --> 47:45.753
which we have become human beings.

47:45.753 --> 47:53.553
First of all we get our sustenance, like we
can say the gold is untarnishable.

47:53.553 --> 47:55.539
That is the sustenance of gold.

47:55.564 --> 48:02.182
We can say carbon has four valences, in the
same way human beings have ten valences – they

48:02.182 --> 48:04.612
are in the stomach.

48:04.612 --> 48:10.402
These are the ten sustenance described as
the Ten Commandments in the Bible.

48:10.402 --> 48:14.092
They all can be explained very well in Sahaj
Yoga.

48:14.092 --> 48:21.892
This is the human sustenance which is around
in that part which we call as Void.

48:21.892 --> 48:28.763
It’s not the same Void, or is the gap, as
the Zen, but this is the Void, we mean the

48:28.763 --> 48:34.993
space where we exist in our evolutionary state.

48:34.993 --> 48:42.132
Now this center is the one that is presided
over – this one, the second one is presided

48:42.132 --> 48:47.672
over by the Creator, and this one is through
the Preserver, the one who preserves.

48:47.672 --> 48:53.453
Now there can be a problem with people who
believe that there is one God.

48:53.453 --> 48:54.912
I also believe the same thing.

48:54.912 --> 48:59.699
I mean, it is true: He – there’s only
one God, but He has different aspects.

48:59.724 --> 49:03.870
God doesn’t exist like, say, Rock of Gibraltar.

49:03.895 --> 49:08.165
Even Rock of Gibraltar, if you see, it has
got aspects.

49:08.165 --> 49:15.175
God has aspects like a gentleman, now say
for example if a gentleman is a minister here,

49:15.175 --> 49:18.944
he could be a husband, he could be a father,
he could be a brother, he could be anything.

49:18.969 --> 49:26.236
So God has different aspects and out of that
the first aspect, as I told you of the existence,

49:26.236 --> 49:34.266
the power of existence, that does not incarnate
on this earth, it does not incarnate, it just

49:34.266 --> 49:39.655
exist, it watches, it sees, and that is in
the heart, which is the Spirit – expression

49:39.655 --> 49:45.326
of that God Almighty who is watching the spectacle
of His Power.

49:45.350 --> 49:51.201
Now the other aspect of God is that He’s
a Creator, He creates all these galaxies and

49:51.201 --> 49:59.661
all these things now as I told you yesterday
about the Vishuddhi Chakra, we are this center

49:59.661 --> 50:08.000
which is America, that if this center is awakened
here, you don’t have to have any missiles

50:08.000 --> 50:09.901
or anything.

50:09.901 --> 50:16.790
As in the Saturn, you have got a girdle around,
you too have that girdle around America and

50:16.790 --> 50:19.901
nobody can touch you, but you are to be awakened
first of all.

50:19.901 --> 50:24.570
If you are awakened in that center, nobody
can touch you.

50:24.570 --> 50:32.610
Russia is going to know about it, they have
to know about it because they are getting

50:32.610 --> 50:36.550
into parapsychology and all these things and
they are going to get possessed about this.

50:36.550 --> 50:41.280
They have to know through their supraconscious
that you are the people who are awakened.

50:41.280 --> 50:46.610
Once you are awakened nobody can touch you,
because there’s a girdle round you, and

50:46.610 --> 50:52.280
there are sixteen sub-plexuses as there are
sixteen, you have seen there are sixteen substar

50:52.280 --> 50:54.011
– sub, what do you call them?

50:54.011 --> 50:55.011
Warren: Moons

50:55.011 --> 51:01.451
Shri Mataji: Moons, they call them moons,
sixteen moons around Saturn.

51:01.451 --> 51:04.251
And you are one guided by Saturn.

51:04.251 --> 51:06.651
Saturn makes this country.

51:06.651 --> 51:11.461
Saturn has made this country, and this is
the Vishuddhi Chakra which is a very important

51:11.461 --> 51:13.530
chakra about which I’ll tell later.

51:13.530 --> 51:17.480
So this center we come to of our evolution.

51:17.480 --> 51:24.220
Is presided by the Preserver, the aspect of
preservation, He’s the Father who looks

51:24.220 --> 51:29.370
after us; He’s the One who gives us our
wellbeing.

51:29.370 --> 51:32.801
He comes on this earth again and again in
different forms.

51:32.801 --> 51:42.230
According to Indian Puranas, the Ark of Noah
was saved by a fish, which was a dolphin,

51:42.230 --> 51:45.401
and this dolphin fish was this aspect which
incarnated.

51:45.401 --> 51:54.290
Then the second aspect came as the tortoise,
then the third as a quadiped.

51:54.290 --> 51:59.820
Like that they have described the evolution,
how these incarnations had to come to break

51:59.820 --> 52:06.561
the barriers of the evolutionary ignorance.

52:06.632 --> 52:09.725
These are the people who came for the break-through.

52:09.750 --> 52:17.300
Ultimately a short man was created called
as Vamana, then a very fiery, big man, he’s

52:17.300 --> 52:21.357
called as Passidon, [Poseidon – ED] in Greek
language.

52:21.382 --> 52:26.360
Greeks made their gods look like human beings;
I mean they never kept their purity.

52:26.360 --> 52:30.211
See, everybody was given with some quality
of a human being.

52:30.211 --> 52:33.941
I don’t know why they did it but that’s
how they spoiled the whole game.

52:33.941 --> 52:42.000
Now this god, the god, which we can say or
the incarnation that came on this earth was

52:42.000 --> 52:51.790
a fiery man, a man who fought the nature,
who fought all the different elements.

52:51.790 --> 53:01.941
And then after that came another aspect on
this earth, who was Shri Rama, is the ideal

53:01.941 --> 53:10.391
king, the king who is a benevolent king, the
One who gave us the political idea about how

53:10.391 --> 53:13.961
to govern – Shri Rama – this was eight
thousand years back.

53:13.961 --> 53:21.191
Then came the incarnation, after that the
incarnation came in the center here, before,

53:21.191 --> 53:26.300
before Rama, this incarnation was of the Goddess,
of the primordial Mother.

53:26.300 --> 53:33.661
She Herself incarnated on this earth before
Rama, because many forces which were negative

53:33.661 --> 53:39.661
were collected by the ignorance of human beings,
and the seekers were very much harmed.

53:39.661 --> 53:47.951
So She came on this earth to kill those horrible,
demonic forces and to destroy them and to

53:47.951 --> 53:54.651
save the seekers, Her children, to save them
from this drowning into the sea of illusion,

53:54.651 --> 53:56.421
and She came on this earth.

53:56.421 --> 54:02.730
As they say she came thousand times, but actually
She came many-a-times before Shri Rama came

54:02.730 --> 54:03.730
in.

54:03.730 --> 54:08.391
Then came Shri Rama who came on the right-hand
side of the heart.

54:08.391 --> 54:11.240
Now this is also a very important center within
us.

54:11.240 --> 54:14.330
Those people who have problems with the fatherhood.

54:14.330 --> 54:19.531
Like today there was a girl who was catching
on the right hand, this heart, this is the

54:19.531 --> 54:20.531
center.

54:20.531 --> 54:26.461
We asked her what about her father, and she
told Me, “My father is dead but he’s still

54:26.461 --> 54:27.730
guiding me.”

54:27.730 --> 54:31.241
I said, “That’s not good, you must give
relief to your father.

54:31.241 --> 54:34.750
He should be given freedom, and you will feel
better.”

54:34.750 --> 54:37.951
And people with this heart get asthma.

54:37.951 --> 54:43.260
This side, this problem, on this finger we
feel, get asthma, problems with their breathing…

54:43.260 --> 54:49.951
All these things can be cured if you just
tell them that, “You ask your father to

54:49.951 --> 54:53.481
leave you and to be born again and forget
about it.”

54:53.481 --> 54:55.620
It works wonders, we have seen.

54:55.620 --> 55:07.901
But recently a doctor in England has performed
some experiments with, what you call, anorexia

55:07.901 --> 55:11.431
– there’s a disease anorexia, where the
girls just don’t eat any food.

55:11.431 --> 55:16.090
He found out that these girls, when they were
told about their father, and that a rite can

55:16.090 --> 55:22.070
be, I mean the after death rites can be done
and all that, they felt all right and they

55:22.070 --> 55:23.491
got rid of it.

55:23.491 --> 55:27.901
Can you imagine this is experimented and found
out now; I mean this we have been doing for

55:27.901 --> 55:32.340
the last ten years, but recently it has been
found out that if a girl is suffering from

55:32.340 --> 55:38.480
this disease of anorexia, you can cure it;
if the father is dead, then only it happens.

55:38.480 --> 55:46.360
So fatherhood –a man who is not a good father,
a man who has a bad father, a girl who is

55:46.360 --> 55:54.271
too much attached to the father or a girl
who is not treated nicely also by her husband

55:54.271 --> 55:58.651
– also the husband is there – if he doesn’t
look after her well, she can suffer.

55:58.651 --> 56:03.120
Now the center part, this one – the one
he’s there [Warren is showing on the Virata

56:03.120 --> 56:07.681
Chakra chart] – center heart, it’s also
a very, very important center where the Goddess

56:07.681 --> 56:15.441
– the world, we say the Mother of the World,
Jagadamba She’s called – has incarnated.

56:15.441 --> 56:23.090
Is a very important thing for us, because
when you suffer, say, from any insecurities,

56:23.090 --> 56:31.161
then this center starts going into palpitations,
this center starts vibrating very much.

56:31.161 --> 56:37.020
Till the boy is of twelve years or a girl
is of twelve years, in the sternum bone the

56:37.020 --> 56:40.401
antibodies are created by this center.

56:40.401 --> 56:46.141
This center creates the antibodies and they
circulate in the whole body and remain there,

56:46.141 --> 56:52.480
and whenever there is an attack, either from
a entity or from any disease or anything,

56:52.480 --> 56:54.260
these antibodies fight it.

56:54.260 --> 56:58.641
And that is the center which is very important,
specially for women.

56:58.641 --> 57:04.250
If their motherhood is challenged or if they
are insecure, if their husbands are making

57:04.250 --> 57:10.491
them insecure by any of their behavior, then
they develop this trouble of this center,

57:10.491 --> 57:13.691
where they may get breast cancer.

57:13.691 --> 57:16.730
Breast cancer comes to women when they are
insecure.

57:16.730 --> 57:25.260
Only it can be cured when this center is awakened;
breast cancer can be very easily cured, if

57:25.260 --> 57:31.671
they could be secured through awakening of
this center of the Mother of the Universe.

57:31.671 --> 57:37.641
And then we have the center up there, which
is the Vishuddhi Chakra, which is a very important…

57:37.641 --> 57:50.270
for you, because it is adorned by the completion
of this evolution as called as Virat – it

57:50.270 --> 57:57.580
is Shri Krishna, who is the complete incarnation
of this primordial being.

57:57.580 --> 58:00.441
And He is placed there.

58:00.441 --> 58:09.935
It is He who is the witness, who is watching.

58:09.960 --> 58:14.401
When the Kundalini rises over this, you start
witnessing the whole thing.

58:14.401 --> 58:20.750
It has got sixteen sub plexuses and which
look after your face, your nose, eyes, ears

58:20.750 --> 58:22.760
and all these places.

58:22.760 --> 58:29.131
And when this center is out, then you have
all kinds of problems.

58:29.131 --> 58:36.300
Say the left side, left side Vishuddhi Chakra
catches when you feel guilty, when you are

58:36.300 --> 58:37.300
diffident.

58:37.300 --> 58:40.901
When you start thinking that, “It is very
wrong too, I should have not done this,”

58:40.901 --> 58:43.191
and all that, then the left Vishuddhi catches.

58:43.191 --> 58:48.441
Or also with smoking it catches; smoking spoils
this center very much.

58:48.441 --> 58:53.451
Imagine in America the percentage of smokers
is the maximum.

58:53.451 --> 58:59.370
Can you imagine, in this center only where
they are born, this is the maximum here?

58:59.370 --> 59:04.394
Like England is the heart of the universe,
where they are lethargic.

59:04.419 --> 59:09.881
Europe is the liver of the world where they
are drinking.

59:09.881 --> 59:14.830
America is the Vishuddhi of the world where
they are smoking.

59:14.830 --> 59:18.877
What a justice done to themselves and to God,
their Creator!

59:19.440 --> 59:21.816
So smoking is against this center.

59:21.995 --> 59:26.551
Thank God now it is established that it causes
cancer, but still people are smoking, they

59:26.576 --> 59:28.364
say, “What does it matter?”

59:28.389 --> 59:33.338
But this is a very, very important center
for us because this is the time when we raised

59:33.363 --> 59:35.259
our head, this center came up.

59:35.284 --> 59:40.394
Now see the ego and superego start developing
actually from here.

59:40.707 --> 59:45.156
So this gives rise to ego and superego.

59:45.156 --> 59:49.467
Somebody is a very arrogant person, catches
on the right; who is a very aggressive type

59:49.467 --> 59:51.467
he catches on the right Vishuddhi.

59:51.467 --> 01:00:04.136
In the center, a person who is against God,
who is anti-God, who is against collectivity,

01:00:04.136 --> 01:00:10.967
who is talking against God, who is openly
saying things against God, catches on this

01:00:10.967 --> 01:00:12.997
center.

01:00:12.997 --> 01:00:19.576
So this center, as it is, is very important
for you, because if you can awaken this center

01:00:19.576 --> 01:00:24.396
within you here, as I’ve told you, you become
as powerful as Shri Krishna.

01:00:24.396 --> 01:00:27.126
Shri Krishna has a Samhara Shakti.

01:00:27.126 --> 01:00:34.937
He has the power to kill; He has four special
things with Him, four weapons by which He

01:00:34.937 --> 01:00:41.586
kills, but one of them is this, in His hand,
is a discus and this discus is shown around

01:00:41.586 --> 01:00:44.318
the Saturn which you see.

01:00:44.343 --> 01:00:49.506
And with this discus at any distance He can
destroy.

01:00:49.506 --> 01:00:52.549
So His destructive powers are built in you.

01:00:52.574 --> 01:00:54.815
Nobody can destroy you.

01:00:56.479 --> 01:01:01.116
You have to just get to your Self and become
your Self.

01:01:01.116 --> 01:01:07.806
You’ll become so powerful a nation – but
powerful in loving, in being compassionate

01:01:07.806 --> 01:01:14.987
and affectionate, in the real sense of the
word, not the way we are now trying to help

01:01:14.987 --> 01:01:16.666
others; is not the way.

01:01:16.666 --> 01:01:21.707
It can be very disgraceful sometimes; the
way we try to help others can be very disgraceful.

01:01:21.707 --> 01:01:27.327
You will be amazed how, sometimes you people
have helped and have created problem for others.

01:01:27.327 --> 01:01:33.737
I’ll give a very simple example which is
really surprising and astonishing.

01:01:33.737 --> 01:01:40.197
Some years back we had a dearth of wheat,
and people sent horrible wheat to India, horrible,

01:01:40.197 --> 01:01:41.697
that even the animals would not eat.

01:01:41.697 --> 01:01:44.336
Just to help us, you see.

01:01:44.336 --> 01:01:47.497
We are not so badly off people; we are very
fussy about food.

01:01:47.497 --> 01:01:52.156
We may be poor but we don’t eat everything;
we are very fussy.

01:01:52.156 --> 01:01:55.806
So people threw away that wheat outside.

01:01:55.806 --> 01:02:01.727
That wheat grew into a grass, which was called
as “Congress Grass,” can you imagine,

01:02:01.727 --> 01:02:09.707
and that grass started moving from the roads
to the fields, from the fields to all the

01:02:09.707 --> 01:02:11.747
trees and started engulfing them.

01:02:11.747 --> 01:02:20.666
It was like a mad grass, it was like a malignant
grass, eating away everything that there was.

01:02:20.666 --> 01:02:23.960
Imagine, as it is we had dearth of thing and
this thing came, and we didn’t know what

01:02:23.985 --> 01:02:25.403
to do with it.

01:02:26.285 --> 01:02:31.249
So we tried some Sahaj Yoga tricks and it
has worked, and thank God that grass is now

01:02:31.274 --> 01:02:32.249
finished.

01:02:32.532 --> 01:02:39.228
But from that grass you had sent some other
seeds of acacia, and these also people threw

01:02:39.253 --> 01:02:40.253
away.

01:02:40.278 --> 01:02:46.886
Out of this came out such horrible trees of
acacia that it has got thorns which are poisonous.

01:02:46.886 --> 01:02:50.866
And in the villages they have grown so big
that children can’t play and if they touch

01:02:50.866 --> 01:02:53.450
that they get very seriously ill.

01:02:53.475 --> 01:02:56.896
It’s a very seri– which you have done
so innocently.

01:02:56.896 --> 01:03:03.543
There’s no grace about it, I think, the
way it was done, and that’s how we can create

01:03:03.568 --> 01:03:07.255
problem through our help to others because
what is there to help.

01:03:07.544 --> 01:03:09.691
Who is the other?

01:03:09.799 --> 01:03:14.149
If you are the collectivity, if you are Shri
Krishna, then what are you helping?

01:03:14.174 --> 01:03:17.229
You are helping yourself, this is your own
finger.

01:03:17.254 --> 01:03:21.454
If you help your own finger, you don’t help
it in a different way than you help other

01:03:21.454 --> 01:03:24.964
fingers.

01:03:24.964 --> 01:03:28.819
That means you become collective being, and
you are.

01:03:29.101 --> 01:03:34.083
People like Abraham Lincoln, as I said yesterday,
and great people in this country established

01:03:34.083 --> 01:03:36.431
these great ideals of liberty.

01:03:36.734 --> 01:03:48.189
And the liberty, they said that, even Roosevelt
once said that “Poverty anywhere is a threat

01:03:48.214 --> 01:03:49.888
to prosperity anywhere.”

01:03:49.913 --> 01:03:55.863
What at great thing to say, to feel that,
that oneness with others, that anywhere poverty

01:03:55.863 --> 01:03:59.363
is a threat to our prosperity!

01:03:59.363 --> 01:04:04.714
All this collectivity has been expressed by
your great men in this country, not only but

01:04:04.714 --> 01:04:13.194
the sense of responsibility because it is
on your shoulders, the responsibility.

01:04:13.194 --> 01:04:21.283
Responsibility of making others the Self,
realize, is your responsibility.

01:04:21.283 --> 01:04:26.066
You are the responsible nation, you are responsible
for the whole universe, whatever things you

01:04:26.091 --> 01:04:28.623
do here that goes outside.

01:04:28.623 --> 01:04:33.163
You took to rock ’n roll, people started
doing rock ’n roll, you did anything nonsensical

01:04:33.163 --> 01:04:34.763
that started going abroad.

01:04:34.763 --> 01:04:38.346
Anything nonsensical you do here spreads everywhere
because Americans are doing.

01:04:38.371 --> 01:04:40.901
Jeans, now everybody wears, even in India!

01:04:40.901 --> 01:04:49.220
Imagine in that hot country they are wearing
very strong, starched ones, and they get all

01:04:49.220 --> 01:04:53.668
kinds of problems with that, circulation problems
[INDISTINCT: I mean?], but…

01:04:53.693 --> 01:04:56.113
“Americans are doing,” everybody is becoming
American in India.

01:04:56.147 --> 01:05:01.003
That’s it, in every developing country you
have put your hand; you have interest in everyone,

01:05:01.003 --> 01:05:08.882
but should be done after realization when
you feel the pangs of others, you feel the

01:05:08.882 --> 01:05:16.802
heart, you feel the real pain of others within
yourself, and you do it, not because you want

01:05:16.802 --> 01:05:19.702
to do it for others, but do it because you
want to save yourself out of that pain.

01:05:19.702 --> 01:05:22.176
You do it for yourself.

01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:27.259
If somebody’s drowned and you try to save
a person who is drowned, then you don’t

01:05:27.284 --> 01:05:30.877
save him you actually are saving yourself
because something in you is getting drowned

01:05:30.902 --> 01:05:32.379
there.

01:05:32.395 --> 01:05:36.615
And that happens to you when you become that
collective being, when you become the Spirit,

01:05:36.615 --> 01:05:38.595
then it happens to you.

01:05:38.595 --> 01:05:44.496
Before that, whatever you do is disgraceful,
sometimes can be harmful, can be very ugly

01:05:44.521 --> 01:05:48.855
and sometimes it can be so grotesque that
people say, “All right, you keep your help

01:05:48.855 --> 01:05:50.355
to yourself, we don’t want to have any more
of this.”

01:05:50.355 --> 01:05:57.125
I mean you take away all the self-respect
of people.

01:05:57.125 --> 01:06:05.835
So one has to understand that you stand here
in this world, in this universe as a collective

01:06:05.835 --> 01:06:10.426
being, as the representative of that collective
being at this Vishuddhi Chakra and you have

01:06:10.426 --> 01:06:12.406
to give with your hands.

01:06:12.406 --> 01:06:15.006
For giving.

01:06:15.006 --> 01:06:20.736
This applies to your hands and you must give,
those hands which have never given are no

01:06:20.736 --> 01:06:26.416
good, they are very insensitive hands, you
must give, and that must come into you, and

01:06:26.416 --> 01:06:33.936
not giving for giving’s sake, but Nirvach,,
as they say, without any, any return about

01:06:33.936 --> 01:06:34.936
it.

01:06:34.936 --> 01:06:38.805
Nothing, is just giving, just flowing, just
like the Sun’s rays are coming to you, they

01:06:38.805 --> 01:06:41.765
don’t want anything in return, do they?

01:06:41.765 --> 01:06:42.765
Just flowing.

01:06:42.765 --> 01:06:52.216
When that should happen, if Sahaj Yoga takes
to it, I hope it takes to America that Americans

01:06:52.216 --> 01:06:55.145
accept Sahaj Yog, that it works out.

01:06:55.145 --> 01:06:57.726
You have already got all kinds of horrible
people here.

01:06:57.726 --> 01:07:04.166
I don’t know how you are going to work it
out, but God willing, with your determination,

01:07:04.166 --> 01:07:06.245
I am sure.

01:07:06.245 --> 01:07:12.666
This is the first Unity Church I’m visiting
and I hope that in other Unity Churches also,

01:07:12.666 --> 01:07:18.865
it will be made convenient for Me and we can
save other people also, and they can become

01:07:18.865 --> 01:07:30.785
realized souls and they can become the Vishuddhi
Chakras, the responsible people, men of God,

01:07:30.785 --> 01:07:35.285
those who have to become prophets, that they
are responsible that they have to make others

01:07:35.285 --> 01:07:44.906
also prophets and save so many seekers who
are gathered in this great country of yours

01:07:44.906 --> 01:07:51.436
because they know here it will happen, and
that they should be enabled to enter into

01:07:51.436 --> 01:07:54.876
the Kingdom of God because the time has come
for that.

01:07:54.876 --> 01:08:01.845
So we come up to Vishuddhi Chakra, and the
last center, chakra, here is the center of

01:08:01.845 --> 01:08:02.845
Christ.

01:08:02.845 --> 01:08:06.166
[ASIDE: Should I go?

01:08:06.166 --> 01:08:13.086
If I do it tomorrow, would be better.

01:08:13.086 --> 01:08:14.825
All right?]

01:08:14.825 --> 01:08:19.456
Tomorrow about Christ I’ll tell you because
I want to take one hour explaining Him very

01:08:19.456 --> 01:08:20.456
well.

01:08:20.456 --> 01:08:29.406
I was very much impressed by your whole idea
about Christ, the unity, the integration and

01:08:29.406 --> 01:08:34.696
your symbols are very correct, everything
is just there, somebody has to just trigger

01:08:34.696 --> 01:08:39.575
it, and it will work out.

01:08:39.575 --> 01:08:46.965
First you must get your realization, grow
into it, develop your discrimination, you

01:08:46.965 --> 01:08:51.485
become your own guru, and then everything
that you are doing in this Unity Church will

01:08:51.486 --> 01:08:58.715
have a great meaning, you can prove it, you
can prove it that there is God, there is Christ,

01:08:58.715 --> 01:09:00.445
there are all these incarnations.

01:09:00.446 --> 01:09:04.179
Christ Himself has said that “Those who
are not against Me are with Me.”

01:09:04.204 --> 01:09:07.200
These are the people.

01:09:08.300 --> 01:09:15.226
And I’m sure one day it will happen that
Unity Church will show its own worth, its

01:09:15.226 --> 01:09:21.463
own explanation of its existence, why it came
into existence.

01:09:21.488 --> 01:09:26.728
Thank you very much.

01:09:28.256 --> 01:09:33.486
May God bless you.

01:09:33.486 --> 01:09:44.946
If you have any questions you may ask, and
then we’ll have the session for realization.

01:09:44.946 --> 01:10:02.046
Seeker: Sometimes in meditation and in chanting,
a person will be rocking.

01:10:04.588 --> 01:10:09.123
Would you consider that a negative thing?

01:10:09.148 --> 01:10:13.768
Warren: Sometimes in meditation people will
rock or move.

01:10:13.793 --> 01:10:15.143
Is this a negative thing?

01:10:15.358 --> 01:10:18.508
Shri Mataji: Absolutely, absolutely.

01:10:18.508 --> 01:10:22.998
You should not rock, there should be no movement,
the eyes should be steady, there should be

01:10:22.998 --> 01:10:25.228
no movement in the eyelids, nothing.

01:10:25.228 --> 01:10:27.468
This rocking is absolutely wrong.

01:10:27.468 --> 01:10:31.891
All these things should not happen to you,
that’s not meditation.

01:10:31.954 --> 01:10:38.854
Meditation is where you are absolutely normal,
you are always in meditation after realization,

01:10:38.854 --> 01:10:40.994
you are in meditation.

01:10:40.994 --> 01:10:47.624
Question: I’ve studied with Paramahansa
Yogananda the SRF, Self-Realization Fellowship,

01:10:47.624 --> 01:10:56.384
and one of the things they teach is to focus
the eyes, with the eyes closed only on the

01:10:56.384 --> 01:10:57.384
[INAUDIBLE].

01:10:57.384 --> 01:11:01.214
Shri Mataji: I must say that I don’t want
to start any controversy.

01:11:01.214 --> 01:11:09.314
That’s one thing sure, but I’ll tell you
that proof of the pudding is in the eating.

01:11:09.314 --> 01:11:12.244
Let’s go this way.

01:11:12.244 --> 01:11:16.784
First of all logically we should see, we have
to get baptism through here, not through here.

01:11:16.784 --> 01:11:19.147
Do we get baptism through here?

01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:26.304
If the door is here what’s the use of breaking
this window?

01:11:26.304 --> 01:11:33.164
And focusing and effort is not going to give
you realization, is wrong.

01:11:33.164 --> 01:11:38.194
You see this pampers– human effort, you
see it pampers you that you can put in an

01:11:38.194 --> 01:11:39.194
effort.

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:40.194
You cannot.

01:11:40.194 --> 01:11:43.814
One must accept this position: we cannot put
in an effort for a living thing.

01:11:43.814 --> 01:11:49.474
For example, as I told you, for a seed if
you have to sprout it you have to put it in

01:11:49.474 --> 01:11:50.474
the Mother Earth.

01:11:50.474 --> 01:11:52.264
You cannot pull it out, isn’t it?

01:11:52.264 --> 01:11:56.164
Whatever you may try, you cannot pull it out
and sprout.

01:11:56.164 --> 01:11:58.744
You cannot put in any effort.

01:11:58.744 --> 01:12:06.094
Any effort is wrong, is against spontaneity
and living things.

01:12:06.094 --> 01:12:09.421
So no effort is needed as such.

01:12:09.446 --> 01:12:16.764
Lady: I’d like to ask Her about that center
where the immune bodies develop, at what age

01:12:16.764 --> 01:12:30.444
and what can we do in order to make that immunity
get bigger or…

01:12:30.444 --> 01:12:32.344
Warren: She says two questions.

01:12:32.344 --> 01:12:40.874
At what age does the immune bodies start developing
and secondly is there any way in which you

01:12:40.874 --> 01:12:43.424
can expand the capacity of the immune bodies?

01:12:43.424 --> 01:12:45.514
Shri Mataji: Of course, of course.

01:12:45.514 --> 01:12:47.984
Of course, that is what Sahaj Yoga is.

01:12:47.984 --> 01:12:53.044
When you become the truth, all untruth falls
off, is that is what Sahaj Yoga is; absolutely

01:12:53.044 --> 01:12:54.054
that is what it is.

01:12:54.054 --> 01:12:58.616
Tomorrow, I am going to tell you about Christ
and about cancer; about all these immune bodies

01:12:58.641 --> 01:13:00.105
how we fight them.

01:13:00.130 --> 01:13:03.614
That may be day after tomorrow, I don’t
know, but tomorrow, may not be, but day after

01:13:03.614 --> 01:13:05.584
tomorrow I’ll tell you how to grow into
it.

01:13:05.584 --> 01:13:06.584
Absolutely.

01:13:06.584 --> 01:13:10.744
You learn how to protect, you learn how to
fight.

01:13:10.744 --> 01:13:11.914
Absolutely.

01:13:11.914 --> 01:13:19.604
That is what happens after realization then
you must learn the divine technique, not before

01:13:19.604 --> 01:13:20.604
realization.

01:13:20.604 --> 01:13:23.124
After realization, not before.

01:13:23.124 --> 01:13:27.144
Before it is connected what’s the use of
playing with it?

01:13:27.144 --> 01:13:29.684
It has to be connected first.

01:13:29.684 --> 01:13:32.804
What is it?

01:13:40.387 --> 01:13:42.379
Warren: Any other questions?

01:13:42.708 --> 01:13:47.494
Man: What are the avenues available to keep
these channels open?

01:13:47.494 --> 01:13:51.534
Warren: What are the avenues available to
keep the channels open?

01:13:51.534 --> 01:13:53.624
Shri Mataji: To be your Spirit.

01:13:53.624 --> 01:14:01.824
And we will let you know later on how to work
it out, how to balance yourself, how the imbalances

01:14:01.824 --> 01:14:02.824
are there.

01:14:02.824 --> 01:14:05.044
This I’ll do it on Wednesday.

01:14:05.044 --> 01:14:11.404
I will tell you how to keep them clear, how
to keep your chakras clear, how to work it

01:14:11.404 --> 01:14:13.694
out, everything I’ll tell you.

01:14:13.694 --> 01:14:14.694
And also –

01:14:14.694 --> 01:14:19.284
[We don’t have a book about it, isn’t
it, but in any case –

01:14:19.284 --> 01:14:20.284
Warren: We’ve got the “Advent.”

01:14:20.284 --> 01:14:21.284
Shri Mataji: Oh yes.

01:14:21.284 --> 01:14:22.284
]

01:14:22.284 --> 01:14:27.044
We have a very big book on this Sahaj Yoga,
which of course we do not sell to everyone,

01:14:27.044 --> 01:14:30.214
but we’ll see about it.

01:14:30.214 --> 01:14:34.474
We’ll see about it because you people are
growing very fast.

01:14:34.474 --> 01:14:40.485
If you people really grow, then we’ll sell
it to you also, but normally we don’t sell

01:14:40.550 --> 01:14:41.790
it to everyone.

01:14:43.157 --> 01:14:45.645
Question: Do you feel Hatha Yoga is necessary?

01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:48.426
Shri Mataji: Not at all, nothing.

01:14:48.451 --> 01:14:51.822
On the contrary Hatha Yoga creates a problem,
I told you in the morning, to a lady who was

01:14:51.847 --> 01:14:52.887
doing Hatha Yoga.

01:14:52.914 --> 01:14:59.284
I told her how Hatha Yoga in the modern times
means nothing but physical acrobats.

01:14:59.284 --> 01:15:00.774
It is not that.

01:15:00.774 --> 01:15:06.524
Hatha Yoga was practiced about, I don’t
know how many years back, about eight thousand

01:15:06.524 --> 01:15:12.524
years back, when we had a different system
of life, where children from five to twenty-five

01:15:12.524 --> 01:15:18.224
lived with a guru who was a realized soul,
and led a very celibate life.

01:15:18.224 --> 01:15:25.774
To such an extent that, that university, any
university – say somebody’s university

01:15:25.774 --> 01:15:31.884
was Vishwamitra, then that realized soul was
Vishwamitra and that university people could

01:15:31.884 --> 01:15:34.044
not marry, even today they cannot marry.

01:15:34.044 --> 01:15:35.794
Even today they cannot marry each other.

01:15:35.794 --> 01:15:38.864
The celibacy of that kind was present in those
days.

01:15:38.864 --> 01:15:43.914
And in that time when you were completely
celibate, you were innocent, you were given

01:15:43.914 --> 01:15:45.784
these Ashtang Yogas.

01:15:45.784 --> 01:15:54.104
There are eightfold paths [DEL: of Sahaj]
of this Hatha Yoga, out of which eighth one

01:15:54.104 --> 01:16:00.484
is Yama-niyama where the discipline and things
are there to maintain a proper life that was

01:16:00.484 --> 01:16:02.104
given to them.

01:16:02.104 --> 01:16:08.744
And then after that when that was done, the
maintenance of the proper life and all that

01:16:08.744 --> 01:16:14.974
was taught, also they were told the exercises
when according to the movement of the Kundalini

01:16:14.974 --> 01:16:17.494
wherever was the problem.

01:16:17.494 --> 01:16:23.784
Supposing the problem is in your particular
center, then you have to do that movement,

01:16:23.784 --> 01:16:26.974
that particular exercise you have to do.

01:16:26.974 --> 01:16:30.544
But it’s, as I told you this morning, that
your car has not started, you are still at

01:16:30.544 --> 01:16:34.164
home and you are paying the toll for what?

01:16:34.164 --> 01:16:38.994
You must move, to find out where is the obstruction,
then you pay the toll.

01:16:38.994 --> 01:16:45.274
And nowadays it is so absurd that we take
[DEL: the Saha–] the Hatha Yoga in such

01:16:45.274 --> 01:16:50.524
a manner that we take the whole medicine box
without having any disease and get diseased.

01:16:50.524 --> 01:16:52.544
It’s a big science.

01:16:52.544 --> 01:16:57.954
Is a very big science one has to understand
that everything is correlated: How is your

01:16:57.954 --> 01:17:03.354
center, which center is catching, what center
requires what kind of treatment, how to clear

01:17:03.354 --> 01:17:05.706
it, and this technique you will learn in no
time.

01:17:05.731 --> 01:17:08.910
It’s very simple, once you get your realization.

01:17:08.949 --> 01:17:14.708
Question: Is there anything that we can start
doing now?

01:17:14.748 --> 01:17:18.101
Shri Mataji: Yes, just now I’m going to
give you realization.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:19.593
All right?

01:17:19.695 --> 01:17:22.935
That’s it, that’s just like a seeker,
just like a seeker.

01:17:22.935 --> 01:17:23.935
[Warren: On the sheet it tells them how to
meditate as well.

01:17:23.935 --> 01:17:26.188
Shri Mataji: Oh that I will tell later.]

01:17:26.213 --> 01:17:26.911
Ha.

01:17:26.936 --> 01:17:28.172
Now what about you?

01:17:28.197 --> 01:17:30.255
You have been raising your hand.

01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:33.184
Question: What kind of a… what kind of a
yoga did Lord Krishna practice?

01:17:33.184 --> 01:17:36.554
Shri Mataji: Sahaj Yoga.

01:17:36.554 --> 01:17:39.084
[Shri Mataji chuckles.]

01:17:39.084 --> 01:17:45.404
Question: According to Yogananda, he said
that Lord Krishna practiced Kriya Yoga.

01:17:45.404 --> 01:17:46.754
Shri Mataji: Not at all, Is wrong.

01:17:46.754 --> 01:17:48.548
He, it is just to apportion of himself to
[INDISTINCT: you.]

01:17:48.548 --> 01:17:52.564
You see, Shri Krishna, if I have time I can
tell them, He in His Gita, He has prescribed

01:17:52.589 --> 01:17:53.932
four things.

01:17:53.947 --> 01:18:01.137
But Krishna was an incarnation of diplomacy;
He was an incarnation of divine diplomacy

01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:10.017
we should say, because when he told Arjuna
that you find it within yourself, the first

01:18:10.017 --> 01:18:13.887
thing, – He was not a businessman, so He
told the best thing first.

01:18:13.887 --> 01:18:18.067
He said, “Find it within yourself the gyana,
the awareness.”

01:18:18.067 --> 01:18:22.687
In your awareness you should find it, you
should find your Spirit, should become that.

01:18:22.687 --> 01:18:25.597
This is the first thing He told.

01:18:25.597 --> 01:18:32.797
But he was, that time a mediocre, an intellectual
I should say, and he said that “You are

01:18:32.797 --> 01:18:38.587
telling me to fight the war and here You are
saying that you find yourself and you become

01:18:38.587 --> 01:18:41.907
yourself, and to be a witness!”

01:18:41.907 --> 01:18:46.177
What Shri Krishna meant was that you become
a witness, then the whole thing becomes a

01:18:46.177 --> 01:18:48.697
drama, but he didn’t understand.

01:18:48.697 --> 01:18:56.587
He, being a father, I give an analogy of a
father who is telling his son that, “The

01:18:56.587 --> 01:19:02.748
horse is behind the cart, so put the horse
in front so the cart will move.”

01:19:02.773 --> 01:19:07.503
But the son is saying that “Why not sitting
down here I move the cart?”

01:19:07.503 --> 01:19:09.993
So he says, “All right, go ahead.”

01:19:09.993 --> 01:19:14.533
He says, “All right, go ahead,” because
if you tell them straightforward they don’t

01:19:14.533 --> 01:19:17.533
listen to you so tell them in another way.

01:19:17.533 --> 01:19:24.073
So the diplomacy, as the essence that you
give absurd conditions, such absurd conditions

01:19:24.073 --> 01:19:28.463
that people discover later on and find that
it was absurd.

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:40.403
So the absurd condition He said that the first
thing you do is to do your karmas, do what

01:19:40.403 --> 01:19:44.393
you want to do and put it at the lotus feet
of the Lord – is an absurd condition.

01:19:44.393 --> 01:19:51.463
You cannot do it because your ego is intact,
you may believe, “I am serving the Lord.”

01:19:51.463 --> 01:19:55.523
You may believe it, “believe” is different
from reality, you are not.

01:19:55.523 --> 01:20:00.723
Because ego is there, and that’s why you
feel hurt, sometimes you take the credit.

01:20:00.723 --> 01:20:04.336
Unless and until you are realized, unless
and until you become a holy personality you’ll

01:20:04.361 --> 01:20:06.156
never say like that.

01:20:06.281 --> 01:20:11.286
After realization what do you say, “It’s
going, it’s coming, Mother it’s not working,

01:20:11.311 --> 01:20:12.609
it just doesn’t work.”

01:20:12.634 --> 01:20:15.051
“It,” you start talking in a third person.

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:19.023
You don’t say, “I’m giving you realization,”
you don’t say so.

01:20:19.048 --> 01:20:20.476
“It’s not working.

01:20:22.271 --> 01:20:23.562
It has worked.

01:20:23.704 --> 01:20:24.704
It has come up.”

01:20:24.729 --> 01:20:25.729
“What?”

01:20:25.754 --> 01:20:26.381
”Realization.”

01:20:26.406 --> 01:20:27.811
You don’t say “I.”

01:20:28.686 --> 01:20:32.836
So you become an akarmi, means like the sun
shines, it doesn’t say, “I shine.”

01:20:32.836 --> 01:20:37.836
There is no karma attached, this was the first
thing He said.

01:20:37.836 --> 01:20:41.646
But this absurdity people never saw, and they
– even today people say, “I am serving

01:20:41.646 --> 01:20:42.646
the Lord.”

01:20:42.646 --> 01:20:48.126
But you are not even connected, how are you
serving Him?

01:20:48.126 --> 01:20:50.306
That’s one thing.

01:20:50.306 --> 01:20:55.736
Because there is ego, you are identified with
ego; actually you are serving your ego.

01:20:55.736 --> 01:20:59.416
Unless and until you become realized, you
do not serve God.

01:20:59.416 --> 01:21:02.566
This is one point which was absurd, He told.

01:21:02.566 --> 01:21:04.936
Then second point – this is Karma Yoga.

01:21:04.936 --> 01:21:10.846
The second point He said was, that “You
should do Bhakti Yoga.”

01:21:10.846 --> 01:21:16.376
Bhakti Yoga is that you should worship Him,
worship God, pray to Him.

01:21:16.376 --> 01:21:22.196
But as usual because He was diplomacy He put
a very interesting word called Ananya.

01:21:22.196 --> 01:21:23.726
You should do Ananya Bhakti.

01:21:23.726 --> 01:21:26.926
Ananya means “when there is not the other.”

01:21:26.926 --> 01:21:36.396
When there is not the other, when you are
not the other, when you are one with God.

01:21:36.396 --> 01:21:39.336
That means all those people who are talking,
“Hare Rama, Hare Krishna, Hare Rama, Hare

01:21:39.336 --> 01:21:41.936
Krishna” on Oxford Street are not connected.

01:21:41.936 --> 01:21:47.756
They are spoiling their throat, will get throat
cancers.

01:21:47.756 --> 01:21:50.166
You are not yet connected, you should be ananya.

01:21:50.166 --> 01:21:54.956
Ananya means you should be realized; you should
be connected with God.

01:21:54.956 --> 01:22:01.906
Imagine, supposing your President Reagan,
I go to him and stand before his house and

01:22:01.906 --> 01:22:04.636
start calling, “Reagan, Reagan, Reagan,”
I’ll be arrested.

01:22:04.636 --> 01:22:08.846
I must have a proper protocol, I must have
proper permission, I should have a proper

01:22:08.846 --> 01:22:11.786
way of going there, isn’t it?

01:22:11.786 --> 01:22:15.596
Everybody starts calling God as if He’s
in his pocket.

01:22:15.596 --> 01:22:24.306
“God give me a job, give me money, give
me a car, give me this,” I mean, imagine.

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.936
You have to be connected with God.

01:22:25.936 --> 01:22:30.206
That’s what He said very clearly, “ananya,”
but these people, these are blind people they

01:22:30.206 --> 01:22:32.286
cannot see through.

01:22:32.286 --> 01:22:41.206
Then the third thing He said that, “It happens
within you that you get these happenings,”

01:22:41.206 --> 01:22:45.126
is the Kundalini Yoga.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:50.466
He said that when the Kundalini starts, the
jalandhara bhanda and all these bhandas take

01:22:50.466 --> 01:22:52.656
place when the Kundalini rises.

01:22:52.656 --> 01:22:58.776
These granthis go into a particular kind of
a formation like a car when you start all

01:22:58.776 --> 01:22:59.776
the engines starts moving.

01:22:59.776 --> 01:23:02.306
So He described all the engine, how it moves.

01:23:02.306 --> 01:23:07.236
That, this Mr. Yogananda picked up and he
said He preached Kriya Yoga.

01:23:07.236 --> 01:23:11.586
That means if you, say, have a car which has
stopped which has not yet started, you move

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:16.806
the wheel and you move all the machines, will
it work?

01:23:16.806 --> 01:23:21.556
You cannot do it.

01:23:21.556 --> 01:23:22.746
It happens automatically.

01:23:22.746 --> 01:23:25.476
It is spontaneous happening within us.

01:23:25.476 --> 01:23:30.216
When we eat our food how the food is digested?

01:23:30.216 --> 01:23:32.096
Automatically.

01:23:32.096 --> 01:23:38.886
In the same way when Kundalini rises, to support
its rise all these bhandas and all these kriyas

01:23:38.886 --> 01:23:44.856
take place and kechari, also your tongue is
pulled in, so people they cut their tongues,

01:23:44.856 --> 01:23:46.496
put it back.

01:23:46.496 --> 01:23:48.676
Is that the way?

01:23:48.676 --> 01:23:51.746
Is absolutely artificial, is stupid.

01:23:51.746 --> 01:23:56.526
To do like that, many people I have seen.

01:23:56.526 --> 01:24:00.156
I don’t know the early ones who came, of
Yogananda they had the tongues wagging like

01:24:00.156 --> 01:24:01.156
that?

01:24:01.156 --> 01:24:05.466
Imagine by doing all these things, “take
out your eyes, take out your nose.”

01:24:05.466 --> 01:24:09.166
This is not the way.

01:24:09.166 --> 01:24:17.196
And that, “You suffer, you shave your heads,
wear a kind of a cloth,” you cannot.

01:24:17.196 --> 01:24:22.996
It’s a thing that’s living within you
and acts in a living way.

01:24:22.996 --> 01:24:26.156
You cannot just maneuver it artificially,
you cannot.

01:24:26.156 --> 01:24:27.746
It has to start!.

01:24:27.746 --> 01:24:33.056
Like even this camera, you see, a television,
anything, this has to be put to the mains.

01:24:33.056 --> 01:24:36.806
You cannot start with your finger the camera
working, can you?

01:24:36.806 --> 01:24:41.557
The electricity has to be there, in the same
way energy of Kundalini has to be there to

01:24:41.582 --> 01:24:44.135
work it out.

01:24:44.160 --> 01:24:46.541
This is absurd.

01:24:50.656 --> 01:24:55.525
So the Kriya Yoga, which is described by Shri
Krishna, is the living process.

01:24:55.550 --> 01:24:58.550
He said, “Is the living tree.”

01:25:00.007 --> 01:25:01.356
I’m surprised.

01:25:01.356 --> 01:25:09.366
We can… human beings are very great, I must
say, the way they make a pai out of everyone.

01:25:09.366 --> 01:25:16.226
So all these great incarnations came on this
earth; they wrote it very clearly; they said

01:25:16.226 --> 01:25:24.766
everything very clearly; it was very simple;
there was nothing to be so much deluded – of

01:25:24.766 --> 01:25:26.546
course he used a word like ananya.

01:25:26.546 --> 01:25:30.756
You see in any dictionary what is the meaning
of word ananya is, mean is “when is there

01:25:30.756 --> 01:25:38.636
is not the other.”

01:25:38.636 --> 01:25:42.686
What have we made of Christ, what have we
made of Krishna, what have we made of Rama?

01:25:42.686 --> 01:25:45.196
When I see this I’m amazed.

01:25:45.196 --> 01:25:52.216
But you can’t make anything out of Me, because
you will get your realization.

01:25:52.216 --> 01:25:58.666
After that, if you try to do anything to Me,
you lose your vibrations, straightforward.

01:25:58.666 --> 01:26:00.596
I can tell you this much.

01:26:00.596 --> 01:26:05.206
There was a gentleman who got his realization
from Me, an Indian.

01:26:05.206 --> 01:26:11.246
Typically he went to New York, started his
thing and then in Los Angeles he started a

01:26:11.246 --> 01:26:18.416
Sahaj Yoga center, and he came back to see
Me in Bombay, and the Sahaj Yogis told that

01:26:18.416 --> 01:26:20.766
“He is just giving us a fit.

01:26:20.766 --> 01:26:22.486
Is horrible.

01:26:22.486 --> 01:26:25.926
His vibrations are horrible.”

01:26:25.926 --> 01:26:28.222
I said, “I know that, you don’t talk to
him.”

01:26:28.247 --> 01:26:30.826
So I called him, I said, “What do you do?”

01:26:30.826 --> 01:26:37.836
“Oh, I have started a big thing there in
Los Angeles and in New York and this and that.”

01:26:37.836 --> 01:26:40.596
“All right, can I have a brochure?”

01:26:40.596 --> 01:26:47.536
You won’t believe he had written, that for
ordinary vibrations seventy-five dollars and

01:26:47.536 --> 01:26:52.416
for extraordinary, special vibrations hundred
and seventy-five dollars.

01:26:52.416 --> 01:26:55.926
So I said, “Oh God, what’s this?”

01:26:55.926 --> 01:26:57.606
I said, “How do you do this way?”

01:26:57.606 --> 01:26:59.956
He says, “Yes Mother, that’s [DEL: what]
how we are to do.

01:26:59.956 --> 01:27:01.176
After all, I have to live.”

01:27:01.176 --> 01:27:05.026
I said, “You have to live, all right, you
do your work that you were doing.

01:27:05.026 --> 01:27:09.426
You were teaching something, you do that,
but you cannot sell these vibrations; I didn’t

01:27:09.426 --> 01:27:10.726
give you for selling.

01:27:10.726 --> 01:27:12.566
Did you buy from Me?”

01:27:12.566 --> 01:27:16.066
And he wouldn’t believe.

01:27:16.066 --> 01:27:20.586
And he was very angry and then he went away.

01:27:20.586 --> 01:27:24.916
He said, “There’s a guru who is in Calicut,
He’s a very wonderful man.”

01:27:24.916 --> 01:27:26.596
I said, “You go and see him.”

01:27:26.596 --> 01:27:30.146
He went and saw him, and this guru wouldn’t
allow him to enter into his house.

01:27:30.146 --> 01:27:31.196
He threw stones at him.

01:27:31.196 --> 01:27:33.086
He wouldn’t allow him to enter even the
gate.

01:27:33.086 --> 01:27:40.476
So he went back to the station, so he was
sitting down there, then somebody met him

01:27:40.476 --> 01:27:45.576
from the guru, he said that “Guru was saying
that, ‘he went and insulted Mother and how

01:27:45.576 --> 01:27:47.326
does he come to be here?

01:27:47.326 --> 01:27:49.956
I’ll not see his face.’”

01:27:49.956 --> 01:27:56.506
Then he sat there for three days, and he was
allowed to go, and then guru sent a very good

01:27:56.506 --> 01:28:00.666
poem about Me in Sanskrit language, which
he read it out to Me.

01:28:00.666 --> 01:28:03.876
But the fellow is just the same still.

01:28:03.876 --> 01:28:08.766
He’s not changed; he’s just the same.

01:28:08.766 --> 01:28:12.996
Now he has no vibrations, he’s not a Sahaj
yogi, he has nothing to do, but he has an

01:28:12.996 --> 01:28:14.976
ashram, he’s making money out of it.

01:28:14.976 --> 01:28:17.726
Of course we have withdrawn our photographs
and everything but he’s just the same, what

01:28:17.726 --> 01:28:19.286
am I to do?

01:28:19.286 --> 01:28:24.436
He is now making them stand on their heads
and do all kinds of things.

01:28:24.436 --> 01:28:26.536
And he has more people than you are here.

01:28:26.536 --> 01:28:30.736
That’s the best part of it.

01:28:30.736 --> 01:28:33.666
People are more attracted to these things
than to reality.

01:28:33.666 --> 01:28:36.866
Is very true.

01:28:36.866 --> 01:28:42.076
When I came last time to America there was
a lady.

01:28:42.076 --> 01:28:45.516
I told her that, “Your guru was believing
in all miracles, and you better not start

01:28:45.516 --> 01:28:46.516
it.”

01:28:46.516 --> 01:28:47.676
She said, “No, no, no, no.

01:28:47.676 --> 01:28:50.736
I want the ultimate, I want the parama, I’m
not going to go into it.”

01:28:50.736 --> 01:28:52.216
I said, “All right.

01:28:52.216 --> 01:28:53.216
Promise Me.”

01:28:53.216 --> 01:28:54.216
She said, “Yes.”

01:28:54.216 --> 01:28:58.236
But then she started getting some sort of
a rice falling from her hand and all that

01:28:58.236 --> 01:29:01.646
and then she started doing her things, you
see?

01:29:01.646 --> 01:29:06.336
She called people told them even the name
of the horses which are going to win, all

01:29:06.336 --> 01:29:07.546
sorts of things.

01:29:07.546 --> 01:29:15.116
And you won’t believe, when I went back
to America to My most embarrassed condition,

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:21.956
I found that she had three thousand disciples
falling at her feet.

01:29:21.956 --> 01:29:26.006
And she was absolutely possessed.

01:29:26.006 --> 01:29:27.776
She came to Me and I told her, “What are
you doing?”

01:29:27.776 --> 01:29:29.866
She said, “Mother, this is the powers You
have given me.”

01:29:29.866 --> 01:29:34.802
I said, “I have never given you these powers
to beat people and tell them about horses.

01:29:35.203 --> 01:29:36.483
Is absurd.”

01:29:36.568 --> 01:29:39.456
She said, “But this is happening to me.”

01:29:39.456 --> 01:29:42.896
I said, “All supraconscious, all nonsense.”

01:29:42.896 --> 01:29:44.846
She wouldn’t listen.

01:29:44.846 --> 01:29:48.546
I said, “All right, tell this gentleman
about his future.”

01:29:48.546 --> 01:29:50.066
She told him something.

01:29:50.066 --> 01:29:53.486
He said , “It’s all wrong, it’s not
true.”

01:29:53.486 --> 01:29:55.626
I said, “Tell this lady.”

01:29:55.626 --> 01:29:56.906
She couldn’t tell.

01:29:56.906 --> 01:30:01.186
So she said, “Mother, have you taken away
my powers?”

01:30:01.186 --> 01:30:03.516
I said, “If they were your powers, I would
have garlanded, I would have worshiped you,

01:30:03.516 --> 01:30:06.706
but they are not yours, they have gone, finished.”

01:30:06.706 --> 01:30:10.993
But she would not give up, you see popularity,
she was on with it.

01:30:11.649 --> 01:30:15.252
Now only thing is she’s in a lunatic asylum.

01:30:15.823 --> 01:30:26.276
So all these things they do, they know how
to make these things, they are so superficial.

01:30:26.276 --> 01:30:30.766
They don’t know what injuries they are doing
to themselves and to others.

01:30:37.323 --> 01:30:40.101
Now, who were asking some question?

01:30:40.126 --> 01:30:40.812
Man.

01:30:40.837 --> 01:30:45.087
I wanted to ask You about the meditations
from the Maharishi Mahayoga, what Your opinion

01:30:45.112 --> 01:30:46.040
was.

01:30:46.095 --> 01:30:52.025
Shri Mataji: Now again the controversy, again
the controversy, the less said the better.

01:30:52.025 --> 01:30:54.095
All right?

01:30:54.095 --> 01:30:55.186
Man: The what?

01:30:55.186 --> 01:30:58.565
Shri Mataji: The less said the better.

01:30:58.565 --> 01:31:04.333
For example, the mantras he gives you.

01:31:04.358 --> 01:31:10.052
You know what they mean, one of them, inga
? It means “the tail of the scorpion.”

01:31:10.077 --> 01:31:13.975
Now where is the scorpion and where is the
tail?

01:31:14.000 --> 01:31:20.290
When the Kundalini has started, then you should
know which center it is catching and what

01:31:20.315 --> 01:31:21.812
mantra to be said.

01:31:21.837 --> 01:31:25.797
It is not that you can just give a mantra
and charge three hundred pounds, and people

01:31:25.797 --> 01:31:27.964
do pay.

01:31:28.675 --> 01:31:32.645
And this flying squad that he has started,
the head of that flying squad here he is,

01:31:32.670 --> 01:31:34.560
is sitting down here, he will tell you.

01:31:34.560 --> 01:31:39.620
The head of that where he went and learnt
from him flying, so called, he suffered from

01:31:39.620 --> 01:31:42.860
epilepsy, his wife suffered from epilepsy,
his daughter suffered from epilepsy, and they

01:31:42.860 --> 01:31:50.670
came to Me and they wrote to him about Me,
in that miserable condition.

01:31:50.670 --> 01:31:54.910
He was the head; he was going to teach them
flying.

01:31:54.910 --> 01:31:59.500
I told him, “Why don’t you ask your guru
to go on this leaning tower of Pisa and make

01:31:59.500 --> 01:32:00.670
him fly?

01:32:00.670 --> 01:32:06.460
And you pay him some money for that, will
be good idea.”

01:32:06.460 --> 01:32:09.030
They paid three thousand pounds for flying.

01:32:09.030 --> 01:32:17.010
You are not going to become birds now, are
you?

01:32:17.010 --> 01:32:21.850
But it is very difficult, you know, to accept
really because you have paid so much money.

01:32:21.850 --> 01:32:26.051
This is like, “We have paid it, so better
have it.”

01:32:26.051 --> 01:32:27.051
You see whatever…

01:32:27.051 --> 01:32:32.570
Like you go to a restaurant and you pay for
it, and may be bad but you eat it.

01:32:32.570 --> 01:32:36.770
You see, after all, you have paid for it.

01:32:36.770 --> 01:32:38.590
That’s human nature, isn’t it?

01:32:38.590 --> 01:32:39.690
Oh, it’s terrible.

01:32:39.690 --> 01:32:44.250
It’s terrible, and difficult to give realization
to people from all these gurus, I can tell

01:32:44.250 --> 01:32:46.610
you, Yogananda… or this, what’s his name
is?

01:32:46.610 --> 01:32:48.670
This Bhandasura’s name, what is his name?

01:32:48.670 --> 01:32:49.670
Warren: Muktananda.

01:32:49.670 --> 01:32:50.670
Shri Mataji: Muktananda.

01:32:50.670 --> 01:32:54.390
I know them very well, I know them.

01:32:54.390 --> 01:33:01.100
I’ve known them for ages, and they know
Me too.

01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:03.820
Yes?

01:33:03.820 --> 01:33:15.140
Lady: Are there other sources where you can
reach your realization other than through

01:33:15.140 --> 01:33:16.140
You?

01:33:16.140 --> 01:33:17.140
[Warren repeats the question.]

01:33:17.140 --> 01:33:18.140
Shri Mataji: Through Me?

01:33:18.140 --> 01:33:22.020
It’s not a question of through Me or anything;
it’s through your Kundalini, is your Kundalini

01:33:22.020 --> 01:33:23.020
within you.

01:33:23.020 --> 01:33:25.100
Lady: Is there someone else that can guide
you or…?

01:33:25.100 --> 01:33:28.250
Shri Mataji: I don’t know, I haven’t seen
many.

01:33:28.250 --> 01:33:32.070
I wish somebody could, like – you see people
are very much hurt to see that I’m doing

01:33:32.070 --> 01:33:33.070
it.

01:33:33.070 --> 01:33:35.210
I said, “Baba, you do it.

01:33:35.210 --> 01:33:37.310
I’ll be very happy to retire, really.”

01:33:37.310 --> 01:33:38.840
They said, “Why You, Mother?”

01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:42.020
I said, “Really, I don’t know why I was
chosen for this.

01:33:42.020 --> 01:33:43.870
It’s a thankless job.

01:33:43.870 --> 01:33:48.560
You must have tremendous patience, I tell
you.

01:33:48.560 --> 01:33:53.430
The day I retire my husband will pay you for
that.

01:33:53.430 --> 01:33:55.850
I can assure you.”

01:33:55.850 --> 01:34:04.010
He’s telling Me that “You are trying to
put patches to the heavens which are falling.”

01:34:04.010 --> 01:34:07.080
He doesn’t believe that I can do it.

01:34:07.080 --> 01:34:11.640
Is a thankless job, absolutely a thankless
job.

01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:15.170
But what to do?

01:34:15.170 --> 01:34:22.240
Once I did feel little frustrated, and I said,
“Let it be now.

01:34:22.240 --> 01:34:26.250
Doesn’t matter, let the destruction come
in.”

01:34:26.250 --> 01:34:33.580
And then you know this clever man, he brought
a photograph of Mine, with My eyes so compassionate,

01:34:33.580 --> 01:34:35.040
such compassion flowing, I said, “Better
do it.

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:38.278
It’s You, what can You do?

01:34:38.303 --> 01:34:41.310
You can’t get out of it, that’s what You
are.”

01:34:41.310 --> 01:34:45.020
So I have to do it, My children, I have to
do it.

01:34:45.020 --> 01:34:47.760
If you could do it, I’ll be very happy.

01:34:47.760 --> 01:34:52.790
Any one, I’ll be extremely happy and retire.

01:34:52.790 --> 01:34:58.510
Warren softly: Other Sahaja Yogis can.

01:34:58.510 --> 01:35:01.910
Shri Mataji: Ha, Of course!

01:35:01.910 --> 01:35:04.580
Other Sahaj yogis can give you realization.

01:35:04.580 --> 01:35:09.910
For example Warren himself has given realization
to I don’t know how many thousand.

01:35:09.910 --> 01:35:16.280
But I know of a person who has given realization
to more than ten thousand people, in India.

01:35:16.280 --> 01:35:17.280
Yes!

01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:21.930
Yes, yes, you can give realization, you can
give it, all right?

01:35:21.930 --> 01:35:28.550
Man: Is the lotus position any special advantage
over sitting normally?

01:35:28.550 --> 01:35:31.770
Warren: Is the lotus position any special
advantage?

01:35:31.770 --> 01:35:35.120
Shri Mataji: Not in Sahaj Yoga, not in Sahaj
Yoga.

01:35:35.120 --> 01:35:43.020
You see now God has decided to give you in
any position you sit; He has to save His creation.

01:35:43.020 --> 01:35:47.890
Many people can’t even sit on the ground,
so they are not to be forced now.

01:35:47.890 --> 01:35:49.990
Whatever position you have, you are all right.

01:35:49.990 --> 01:35:52.260
You drink, all right.

01:35:52.260 --> 01:35:53.330
You take drugs, all right.

01:35:53.330 --> 01:35:55.870
You are a thief, all right.

01:35:55.870 --> 01:35:58.200
Any kind, come along.

01:35:58.200 --> 01:36:00.860
Once you get realization these things will
drop out.

01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:04.600
This is the trick.

01:36:04.600 --> 01:36:08.790
Better come along and have it.

01:36:08.868 --> 01:36:13.119
There’s no position required, nothing required,
only the desire to

01:36:13.243 --> 01:36:16.631
be the Spirit, that’s all.

01:36:16.656 --> 01:36:18.702
First one man: We’ll take it.

01:36:18.727 --> 01:36:20.114
[several people start to echo the request:
“We’ll take it.”]

01:36:20.123 --> 01:36:22.943
Warren: They want it.

01:36:22.943 --> 01:36:24.419
Shri Mataji: Now they want it, that’s all.

01:36:24.444 --> 01:36:25.402
Man: May we have it.

01:36:25.427 --> 01:36:26.810
Shri Mataji: So, that’s all, that’s the
best way.

01:36:26.920 --> 01:36:29.105
Now those who got

01:36:29.129 --> 01:36:32.329
it yesterday are here, some of them, and those
who have come for

01:36:32.371 --> 01:36:36.371
the first time are also here.

01:36:36.429 --> 01:36:39.729
Two ladies: what’s wrong with that?

01:36:39.754 --> 01:36:41.341
What was that again?

01:36:41.366 --> 01:36:43.620
Warren: They just want
You

01:36:45.247 --> 01:36:48.386
Shri Mataji: No, yesterday some people got
realization and

01:36:48.411 --> 01:36:49.284
some of

01:36:49.309 --> 01:36:51.849
you are new people.

01:36:53.048 --> 01:37:00.432
We’ll have to, later on, see them, those
who are new.

01:37:00.465 --> 01:37:02.740
would like to meet them.

01:37:02.841 --> 01:37:04.732
As yesterday I couldn’t meet them.

01:37:04.757 --> 01:37:09.757
So I would like to meet them and those who
are new, also we’ll if we can work it out…

01:37:09.700 --> 1194:39:14.191
All right?
