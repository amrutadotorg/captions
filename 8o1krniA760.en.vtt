00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.520
Please be seated.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.200
Madras is known for perfect rituals about puja

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.960
and that is how

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.960
in the growth of our awareness

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.080
even towards God and towards the rituals

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.400
we have moved from reality.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.960
As they say the tree of awareness grows downwards

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:49.960
so in the West

00:01:50.354 --> 00:01:51.960
it grew towards materialism,

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:54.200
grew towards

00:01:56.381 --> 00:01:58.311
something that was filthy

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:00.819
went down and down.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.440
But as Shri Krishna has said the roots are in your head

00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:10.455
But in the Hindu religion

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.639
it didn't go that bad.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:15.537
In other religions it did

00:02:15.844 --> 00:02:17.960
but not in Hindu religion that bad.

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.960
What happened in the Hindu religion that it went

00:02:24.112 --> 00:02:26.807
to the left or to the right.

00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:29.960
So when it went to the right

00:02:31.161 --> 00:02:32.465
it went towards

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:37.960
the elements of worshipping of elements.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.565
That's how they started Vedas.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:48.377
Vedas are like Stuties and Smrities are made

00:02:49.218 --> 00:02:50.960
to master the elements,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.960
to master the elements.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.480
How do you master the elements?

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.560
You can ask the breeze to blow in

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.720
now you need some breeze, all right have it.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.000
you can do the

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.520
Sun miracles of every kind.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.080
You can get the rain if you want

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.440
all these things could have been done

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.080
through the Vedas.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.840
But the first and forth thing fore

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:28.320
foremost thing in the Vedas, is that

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.560
it should be Vida, Vida is the word,

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.480
Vida is the main word.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.040
Now vida means bodha

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.040
Bodh means the experience

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.880
of the central nervous system.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.000
It doesn't mean that I give you a big lecture

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.280
or you read some books,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.480
you read Vedas by heart, no.

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.400
It was meaning that you first become the vidas.

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.480
vidvanaas, vid, vid means, the bodhas

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:06.480
That means the awareness must achieve it's fourth dimension

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.800
and should, you should become

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.760
a  person with that fourth dimension,

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.480
achieving the sensation

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:23.400
of the All-Pervading  power

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:27.200
on your central nervous system.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.240
This was what Vedas were.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.280
But when you have achieved it and then you read the Vedas

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.960
then you can have power on all the elements.

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:47.800
So then now, if you read stuties and smrities, it has a meaning.

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.240
But to achieve that state first of all, is important.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.360
That's why in sahaja yoga we don't deal with Vedas just now.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.280
We have to achieve that state,

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:05.680
when by reading those Vedas or by saying those mantras

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.960
we can achieve that state in which automatically,

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:19.160
spontaneously you can have power on all the elements.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.160
But not with desires, it just works out spontaneously,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:25.800
is a state, is a state of a personality.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.960
So, this is how it started.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:35.000
Now, even in the Vedas

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.720
they wanted to go to the essence of everything.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.560
It was not nirakara they talked of

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:46.160
but the essence of every chakras.

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.760
To say that they just talked of nirakara

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.440
is the way, you don't understand at all Veda.

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:59.520
They didn't talk of the formless

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.840
they talked of the all pervading Power, which is formless.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:10.760
They talked about that part which is the essence of chakras

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:15.040
but they didn't want to talk about the Deities.

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:18.400
Because when you talk about the Deities

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.640
then people get stuck with it.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.320
Like as I always say that when you talk about the flowers

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:28.960
people get stuck to it and they don't seek the

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:33.880
nectar, they don't seek the honey.

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:37.360
Now, the second part is, if you talk about the honey

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:41.640
also you just talk about the honey.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:44.400
It's talk and talk.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:50.680
So you have to become a madhukar, you have to become the bee,

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:52.760
to get to that honey.

00:06:52.960 --> 00:06:54.480
That's the main point.

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.560
Unless and until you become the bee you cannot get to the honey

00:07:00.760 --> 00:07:04.360
whether you talk about honey or about flowers.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.280
So Vedas also became another talk

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:12.840
and after that the horrible thing happened was the Arya Samaj.

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:14.280
That's the worst of all.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:17.040
I mean if you meet any Arya Samaji you feel like jumping in the sea,

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.120
I mean to get rid of him, it's horrible.

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.240
He talks, talks, talks,talks through his hat,

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.200
he doesn't know what he's talking and what he is meaning.

00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.960
So this Arya Samaj business came out of the same Veda

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.760
which is a one side, the right side.

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.760
So we got stuck on to the right side;

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:41.040
the awareness, the tree of awareness got stuck,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:44.920
the leaves caught on to the right side.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.754
Like in the West they have got it in the grounds ,

00:07:49.027 --> 00:07:50.960
absolutely into the filth.

00:07:51.447 --> 00:07:53.840
the dirt of Mooladhara, beyond Mooladhara.

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:57.326
But we too have lost ourselves

00:07:58.240 --> 00:07:59.323
on to the right side

00:08:00.523 --> 00:08:03.960
and doing all supra conscious nonsense at the time of

00:08:07.080 --> 00:08:07.960
Changdev

00:08:09.636 --> 00:08:13.690
that was when Shri Gyaneshwara was there.

00:08:14.887 --> 00:08:16.960
he was a supra conscious mind person

00:08:18.360 --> 00:08:21.960
and he tried to show some supra conscious miracles.

00:08:23.840 --> 00:08:27.752
to Shri Gyaneshwara.

00:08:28.797 --> 00:08:33.306
Gyaneshwara and his brothers and sisters were sitting on a wall

00:08:35.355 --> 00:08:37.413
and suddenly the whole wall lifted up

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.768
and took them from one place to another

00:08:41.026 --> 00:08:42.415
and this fellow was surprised

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:46.415
how on material things how they are working out.

00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.549
because they became first of all

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.280
realized souls of a very high level.

00:08:53.648 --> 00:08:55.804
Gyaneshwara was an incarnation

00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:00.960
and then they had also their mastery

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.360
over all the five elements.

00:09:03.329 --> 00:09:05.657
But that is first you go urdhwagami

00:09:06.204 --> 00:09:08.000
first you achieve your realization,

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.960
you achieve your state of your realization

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:15.400
and then you come down

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.457
in a way that you go to the right

00:09:18.723 --> 00:09:19.960
and you can go to the left.

00:09:20.338 --> 00:09:22.604
But first your doings must be built.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:24.440
This was the state.

00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:26.960
That's how in our Hindu religion

00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.960
we got stuck upon the right side

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:31.960
say mantras, stuties and you are not realized soul,

00:09:31.985 --> 00:09:33.120
you are not even vidas.

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:38.960
Without realization it's like a charpat panjari,

00:09:39.024 --> 00:09:41.960
as they call it, it's just talking,talking, talking, talking.

00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:44.920
so that is no use.

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:48.960
The second thing was, we got stuck on the left

00:09:49.656 --> 00:09:52.920
in the sense, where they talked of the Deities

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:56.400
we started worshipping Deities,

00:09:58.249 --> 00:09:59.960
who would worship the Deities.

00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.741
you have no right to worship,

00:10:01.766 --> 00:10:03.397
you have no passage to them,

00:10:03.616 --> 00:10:05.123
you have no connection with them.

00:10:05.287 --> 00:10:06.920
How are you worshipping them?

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.236
In the air somewhere, they're worshipping,

00:10:09.376 --> 00:10:12.175
like going to Vitthal mandir

00:10:12.948 --> 00:10:14.400
in Maharashtra.

00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.392
You see it was alright

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:20.374
for Tukarama to worship

00:10:21.642 --> 00:10:23.243
because they were all realized souls.

00:10:23.837 --> 00:10:25.960
But these stupid people nowadays,

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.960
from the villages, they take some Tabacco in the mouth

00:10:32.314 --> 00:10:34.345
and go on worshipping God

00:10:35.994 --> 00:10:37.960
in the sense that they go on saying alright

00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:40.480
Vitthal, Vitthal, Vitthal,  all like mad going

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.960
till they break their necks and

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:45.960
when they go there also these,the priests there

00:10:46.681 --> 00:10:49.360
break their heads actually, just like coconuts.

00:10:49.978 --> 00:10:52.892
And I have met many who have lost their heads completely.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.960
they said we got it through Vitthal.Imagine.

00:10:57.927 --> 00:11:00.224
Vitthala gave this, Imagine!

00:11:00.451 --> 00:11:01.841
This is the situation.

00:11:02.976 --> 00:11:06.280
So we have to realize that we also in our seeking,

00:11:07.591 --> 00:11:09.434
we got stuck on to the left hand side.

00:11:09.755 --> 00:11:11.960
But much worse in Madras I've seen a horrid scenes

00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:14.960
like I saw

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:17.960
ladies going round the temple

00:11:18.101 --> 00:11:19.960
somebody pouring water

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:23.286
was so shocked

00:11:23.621 --> 00:11:26.880
at the cruelty of this kind of a thing. I sat down

00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:29.718
was wondering, who told them this nonsense?

00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:31.456
God knows?

00:11:32.364 --> 00:11:34.960
Then the ritualism was taken over,

00:11:35.652 --> 00:11:37.769
which was not real rituals because

00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.960
you have not connected by the Brahmins

00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:42.429
all over India.

00:11:43.882 --> 00:11:46.920
Now the Brahmins are the ones, who have known the Brahma.

00:11:47.707 --> 00:11:50.261
You are Brahmins because you know the Brahma.

00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.960
But Brahmins were not

00:11:53.581 --> 00:11:55.347
to be considered as Brahmins

00:11:56.064 --> 00:11:58.175
because they are born in a Brahmin family.

00:12:00.108 --> 00:12:01.960
It was not according to your birth

00:12:02.047 --> 00:12:03.960
but according to your karmas,  is a fact

00:12:04.581 --> 00:12:06.000
I'll give you an example.

00:12:08.477 --> 00:12:11.456
Like, once there was a problem,

00:12:11.481 --> 00:12:14.563
Shankaracharya, so called,

00:12:15.264 --> 00:12:17.266
raised a Parliament question, you see,

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:18.960
that

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.960
it is written in the Gita that

00:12:27.218 --> 00:12:29.460
you get your birth

00:12:29.515 --> 00:12:31.397
prenatal natal or post-natal stuff.

00:12:31.826 --> 00:12:33.406
In the post-natal condition

00:12:33.440 --> 00:12:37.880
whatever you are born that is your caste.

00:12:38.312 --> 00:12:39.960
and so, the Brahmins

00:12:40.571 --> 00:12:42.830
are the only ones allowed in the temples

00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:45.597
and so as we are born Brahmins we are the ones

00:12:45.644 --> 00:12:46.960
allowed in the temples.

00:12:48.960 --> 00:12:51.839
So that time a person came to ask Me,

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:52.960
how to answer this.

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:55.538
I said,"very simple".

00:12:55.850 --> 00:12:57.240
You ask them who wrote Gita?

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.542
Vyasa. Who was Vyasa?

00:13:00.714 --> 00:13:04.960
Illegitimate child of a  fisher woman.

00:13:11.648 --> 00:13:13.648
Now, how can he say such a thing?

00:13:14.351 --> 00:13:15.922
Because he was a Brahmin.

00:13:16.244 --> 00:13:18.960
It's true, only the Brahmins must be allowed in the temple.

00:13:19.320 --> 00:13:21.464
But who are the Brahmins is the basic problem.

00:13:23.299 --> 00:13:26.843
If you are born as a Brahmin, you are not a Brahmin according to

00:13:27.125 --> 00:13:28.960
Hindu religion. Should not be.

00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:31.857
You have to know the Brahma.

00:13:32.044 --> 00:13:33.528
What about Valmiki?

00:13:33.724 --> 00:13:35.325
He was another fisherman,

00:13:36.511 --> 00:13:37.960
who became a daaku.

00:13:38.744 --> 00:13:40.126
He was a dacoit

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.630
and this dacoit was really a horrible man.

00:13:46.044 --> 00:13:48.892
But was corrected by Narada, as you know the whole story.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:51.127
So, he is the Valmiki.

00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:54.480
Now, how does Valmiki becomes a Brahmin?

00:13:58.315 --> 00:13:59.643
So, how is he

00:14:00.940 --> 00:14:04.960
the one who wrote Ramayana, who was a dacoit

00:14:07.456 --> 00:14:09.698
and born of such a low caste.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.960
But they will not allow Vaidas

00:14:17.306 --> 00:14:19.173
and Kabir Das to enter the temples,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.515
but these horrible, so called brahmins

00:14:21.859 --> 00:14:25.120
are sitting there eating the money,that is given to God.

00:14:26.111 --> 00:14:28.880
So it is necessary for Indian sahaja yogies

00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.960
to understand how we have failed

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.080
we must know our defects,

00:14:33.794 --> 00:14:37.747
why we have failed in our pursuit of God?

00:14:39.408 --> 00:14:41.218
Why there are so many temples?

00:14:41.321 --> 00:14:42.588
See, many people ask Me

00:14:42.745 --> 00:14:45.104
Mother, You say, it's a yoga bhumi,

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.920
it is this that then, why are you so poor?

00:14:49.847 --> 00:14:51.960
Why such a problem in your country?

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.081
The reason is  we're not yogis

00:14:57.237 --> 00:14:59.300
Yogakshema vahamamyam

00:14:59.401 --> 00:15:01.960
if you get the yoga, then He gives you kshema.

00:15:02.859 --> 00:15:04.960
First you get the yoga then the kshema,

00:15:05.289 --> 00:15:07.760
without the yoga, there is no kshema.

00:15:08.473 --> 00:15:10.880
And without the yoga, you are not the Brahmin.

00:15:11.379 --> 00:15:12.960
That's as  simple as that.

00:15:14.439 --> 00:15:16.681
Even to interpret Shri Krishna

00:15:17.486 --> 00:15:18.960
you have to be a realized soul.

00:15:20.265 --> 00:15:22.453
See what He says, three things He has said,

00:15:23.219 --> 00:15:24.579
Bhakti yoga He says,

00:15:24.892 --> 00:15:26.783
"Patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam"

00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:29.293
all these things, I

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:31.519
give to you.

00:15:33.911 --> 00:15:36.960
I take from you, I receive.

00:15:38.706 --> 00:15:40.175
When it comes to giving,

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:41.960
He says, the word ananya bhakti,

00:15:41.985 --> 00:15:44.486
ananya; means when there not the other.

00:15:45.107 --> 00:15:47.255
When this happens, He is the diplomat.

00:15:47.624 --> 00:15:49.898
I want to tell you frankly on your face.

00:15:51.078 --> 00:15:52.960
Ananya means when you are a yogi,

00:15:54.042 --> 00:15:55.628
when there is not the other.

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:00.960
Then He comes to second point.

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.561
Gyana He said the first thing.Gyana means bodh

00:16:05.912 --> 00:16:07.678
bodh marg that is sahaja yoga.

00:16:10.179 --> 00:16:11.960
Then about karma, right side

00:16:12.538 --> 00:16:13.920
what does He say?

00:16:14.093 --> 00:16:16.857
You do all your work and put it at My lotus feet.

00:16:17.360 --> 00:16:19.880
"Karmanye va dhi karastey phaleshu ma kadachin."

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:22.070
Impossible situation.

00:16:22.248 --> 00:16:23.640
See this is diplomacy

00:16:24.093 --> 00:16:26.960
Put absurd conditions, which look sensible,

00:16:27.086 --> 00:16:27.960
but are absurd,

00:16:28.149 --> 00:16:29.836
so you go on rubbing with that.

00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.930
There are many who tell Me,Mother,

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:34.474
we do, all our jobs and put at the Lotus Feet of God.

00:16:34.912 --> 00:16:36.960
I said, "Really, how do you know that?"

00:16:38.334 --> 00:16:41.357
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

00:16:41.584 --> 00:16:43.055
you feel you are doing it

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:43.960
but once you're realized soul

00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:45.720
you said, 'It's going, it's coming,

00:16:45.951 --> 00:16:47.240
it's happening, not happening,

00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:53.120
see the point.

00:16:54.418 --> 00:16:56.942
Now, because of this

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.960
what happens that

00:17:03.932 --> 00:17:05.635
people get into a bhrama,

00:17:05.697 --> 00:17:07.111
into an illusion

00:17:07.658 --> 00:17:09.080
that we are doing all God's work

00:17:09.693 --> 00:17:11.960
and putting at His feet, you are not.

00:17:12.646 --> 00:17:13.960
You are not a realized soul

00:17:14.801 --> 00:17:16.415
you have to become a third person

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:17.960
you have to say, I am giving it.

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:21.385
No, it's going, it's coming

00:17:22.232 --> 00:17:23.240
I goes away.

00:17:24.137 --> 00:17:26.559
Doesn't work out, it works out.

00:17:26.964 --> 00:17:28.502
You never say, 'Mother,

00:17:28.527 --> 00:17:29.960
I can't work out sahaja yoga.

00:17:29.985 --> 00:17:31.299
I've not heard anybody saying that.

00:17:31.324 --> 00:17:32.689
They say, Mother,  doesn't work out,

00:17:32.996 --> 00:17:34.584
it works out,  it's working.'

00:17:34.779 --> 00:17:37.475
We start just talking about it all the time,

00:17:37.615 --> 00:17:40.230
as soon as we become a realized soul.

00:17:42.964 --> 00:17:45.371
There was a lady, who came with Me to America

00:17:46.128 --> 00:17:49.333
and she said, Mother, please give realization to my son.

00:17:49.440 --> 00:17:51.685
He's come all the way from Honolulu, this that.

00:17:52.372 --> 00:17:53.537
I said, "You give him."

00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:55.122
I can't.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:56.740
I said then, "How can I?"

00:17:57.381 --> 00:17:59.412
Then you give him a certificate, he is a realized soul.

00:17:59.437 --> 00:18:02.119
How can I, it's false? I said that's what it is.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.077
It has to happen.

00:18:05.288 --> 00:18:06.960
You cannot give a false certificate

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.032
that you are a realized soul, it has to happen.

00:18:12.368 --> 00:18:14.540
And that is what sahaja yoga is

00:18:14.595 --> 00:18:16.080
absolutely a shuddh vidya (pure knowledge)

00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:17.960
and a shuddh thing

00:18:18.671 --> 00:18:21.840
that in that you have to get realization

00:18:21.865 --> 00:18:23.960
and establish yourself.

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:26.960
So by going to the left-side

00:18:27.215 --> 00:18:28.849
we got stuck up into the

00:18:29.193 --> 00:18:32.185
collective subconscious.This side the collective supra conscious

00:18:32.302 --> 00:18:35.240
that side the collective subconscious.

00:18:35.304 --> 00:18:37.960
The people who are now in the West have

00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:40.530
discovered all about the matter and all that

00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:44.531
has come out of this kind of a venture on the right hand side

00:18:45.374 --> 00:18:48.742
because God wanted them to know that know the matter

00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.674
that's all, for their convenience, for their comfort,

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.960
for giving them more time,

00:18:55.280 --> 00:18:56.400
so that they come to God.

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.741
But Science moved in a one linear way

00:19:00.803 --> 00:19:04.194
and has produced atom bombs and everything like rakshasas

00:19:04.374 --> 00:19:06.922
and now they are waiting for the rakshasas

00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.750
to drop down upon themselves.

00:19:09.044 --> 00:19:10.283
On the left-hand side

00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.056
now we, now, this is India

00:19:13.174 --> 00:19:14.713
left hand side is India.

00:19:16.241 --> 00:19:18.491
We got stuck, we are stucky people.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.920
You see, they lost their roots,

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:23.800
you can be fool them like anything in

00:19:23.825 --> 00:19:25.482
as far as religion is concerned.

00:19:26.372 --> 00:19:28.080
They have no roots at all also

00:19:29.288 --> 00:19:32.880
because they have gone down so much

00:19:33.378 --> 00:19:35.960
or there, their roots are lost, they have no roots.

00:19:36.087 --> 00:19:38.364
They're dangling, you can put them into left or right

00:19:38.637 --> 00:19:41.960
You know, witchcraft is so much common in America.

00:19:42.382 --> 00:19:44.175
You can put them into witchcraft,

00:19:44.208 --> 00:19:46.395
you can put it into any craft you want to

00:19:46.629 --> 00:19:47.870
you can manage them.

00:19:47.895 --> 00:19:50.468
or they can go to the right side, they can go to the left side

00:19:50.493 --> 00:19:51.960
you can create Hitlers out of them,

00:19:51.985 --> 00:19:53.771
you can created anything what you want

00:19:53.796 --> 00:19:55.960
because they have become just like bananas,

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.051
they have no roots.

00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:01.960
So one side, we got stuck with this

00:20:02.461 --> 00:20:05.792
too much argumentation, too much of discussion,

00:20:05.824 --> 00:20:09.443
too much of what you call Philosophy

00:20:09.693 --> 00:20:13.396
this that, the intellectuals, so called, vidvanas

00:20:13.774 --> 00:20:17.080
in the Hindu Philosophy, are stupid people.

00:20:18.433 --> 00:20:20.558
Because they have not got their realization

00:20:21.658 --> 00:20:25.353
and even to such an extent, now they are saying that

00:20:26.540 --> 00:20:29.540
Adishankaracharya did not write,

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.090
Adishankaracharya did not write the

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.629
Saundarya Lahiri.

00:20:37.549 --> 00:20:38.751
Intellectuals, you know,

00:20:39.462 --> 00:20:41.960
they are the great grandfathers of Adi Shankaracharya

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:43.960
so they're saying he did not write.

00:20:44.659 --> 00:20:48.320
Because, how can a Vivek Chudanami, the one he wrote, you see,

00:20:48.632 --> 00:20:51.492
after that whole thing such a treatise of

00:20:51.678 --> 00:20:54.063
all Philosophy, how could he write

00:20:54.188 --> 00:20:56.960
that you must serve the Mother,

00:20:57.584 --> 00:20:58.822
how can that be?

00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.960
In puja you should sit in right manner.

00:21:03.357 --> 00:21:06.200
Don't do this, you attention should be towards Me.

00:21:09.530 --> 00:21:13.960
Alright, so as a result of that what happened that we

00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:20.216
got lost into intellectual understanding of our

00:21:21.732 --> 00:21:24.960
Philosophy and for that

00:21:27.675 --> 00:21:29.960
As Kabir Das has put it

00:21:30.011 --> 00:21:31.960
"'Padhi, padhi pundit moorakh bhaiye."

00:21:31.985 --> 00:21:33.960
So they have become stupid fools right side.

00:21:35.013 --> 00:21:38.404
Left side people got stuck into these rituals

00:21:39.077 --> 00:21:41.069
so these Brahmins became very powerful

00:21:41.124 --> 00:21:44.628
so called Brahmins. So much so that in Nasik

00:21:45.019 --> 00:21:48.960
the Brahmins sent Me word saying that the

00:21:49.459 --> 00:21:51.186
because You have come from abroad

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.428
you have to come for your prayaschit to us.

00:21:53.453 --> 00:21:55.557
Even Gandhiji had to do the prayashchit.

00:21:55.682 --> 00:21:58.854
I said, "One day you will have to do prayashchit."

00:21:59.523 --> 00:22:00.960
Such arrogance

00:22:01.986 --> 00:22:04.175
and such horrid things they're doing.

00:22:05.511 --> 00:22:07.082
And Kashi Vishweshwara

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.831
they have got Romans, you see, Roman soldiers.

00:22:12.159 --> 00:22:14.570
Actually they came to Maharashtra

00:22:14.796 --> 00:22:16.585
on the Konkan side

00:22:17.148 --> 00:22:20.006
maybe in Goa or some place, Panaji maybe,

00:22:20.529 --> 00:22:23.960
and from there they went.

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:26.960
Adi Shankaracharya must have thought

00:22:27.592 --> 00:22:29.693
that in the beginning they were nice people

00:22:29.718 --> 00:22:31.960
He must have given realization one or two person

00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:34.314
So he appointed all of them,

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.785
these Konkanasthas, They are Konkanash
(One Cast of Brahmins in India)

00:22:38.307 --> 00:22:40.151
into all these places

00:22:40.690 --> 00:22:42.960
and within two, three generations, two generations,

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:45.744
I think, they came in their true colors as Romans.

00:22:47.280 --> 00:22:49.960
And they're just like cobras, you see, like cobras.

00:22:51.797 --> 00:22:56.461
And in Kashi Vishweshwara they started using women.

00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:01.723
They had a one big slippery board

00:23:02.445 --> 00:23:04.179
and the when women went there,

00:23:04.204 --> 00:23:06.280
they used to fall down with ornaments, on them

00:23:06.627 --> 00:23:08.322
Then they would take out all the ornaments,

00:23:08.347 --> 00:23:09.960
sell these women as prostitutes.

00:23:09.989 --> 00:23:11.160
That's why in Banaras

00:23:11.261 --> 00:23:13.160
you have the maximum number of prostitutes.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:19.370
These Brahmins the way they behaved

00:23:19.894 --> 00:23:24.430
in certain places like, Ranchordas's temple,

00:23:25.336 --> 00:23:30.077
all the Nath Dwara

00:23:31.819 --> 00:23:35.388
that was called as haveli, it was a very big case

00:23:36.427 --> 00:23:38.653
and the main man there, the haveli man,

00:23:38.724 --> 00:23:39.960
the one who, chief priest,

00:23:40.820 --> 00:23:42.508
was supposed to used

00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:44.631
the brides on the first night.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.080
I know of so many great women, who have been used by him.

00:23:50.429 --> 00:23:53.715
All this nonsense started growing in this country like that.

00:23:55.066 --> 00:23:57.512
So many things, I mean there is no end to it

00:23:58.685 --> 00:24:00.960
even in Vindhya, Vindhiya Vasini, they did it.

00:24:01.746 --> 00:24:03.754
Then out of these at the extreme end,

00:24:03.779 --> 00:24:05.320
started coming the tantrism

00:24:06.605 --> 00:24:09.230
and the tantrikas discovered a thing

00:24:09.617 --> 00:24:12.960
that if you can displease the Goddess in any place

00:24:13.437 --> 00:24:15.484
then that place becomes a vacuum

00:24:15.509 --> 00:24:16.883
because She's so much there.

00:24:16.938 --> 00:24:19.580
Once She goes away, the vacuum is created,

00:24:19.689 --> 00:24:22.816
then use that vacuum for getting all the bhoots there

00:24:23.191 --> 00:24:24.472
like Kamakhya Devi.

00:24:24.659 --> 00:24:27.272
There are twenty-eight places where the goddess's

00:24:27.304 --> 00:24:29.983
body fell down, when you know the Sati,

00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.960
Sati's body fell,

00:24:32.026 --> 00:24:34.811
She was carried from Daksha, the father

00:24:34.901 --> 00:24:38.215
by Shiva it fell down on twenty-eight places

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.978
and when it fell down on twenty-eight places

00:24:41.064 --> 00:24:44.403
There form a temple, came out of the mother Earth.

00:24:45.083 --> 00:24:46.920
One of them is Kamakhya Devi

00:24:47.059 --> 00:24:51.070
that is, I think, in Assam or Bihar some border there.

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:56.149
All these temples were used for doing negative things

00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.529
because they did vyabhichara all that

00:24:58.572 --> 00:25:00.052
in the presence of the goddess,

00:25:00.077 --> 00:25:01.960
as a result of the goddess, you see,

00:25:02.259 --> 00:25:04.724
the goddess got angry, She went away from there.

00:25:04.749 --> 00:25:06.895
Because, you know, supposing you put the filth here,

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.416
I won't sit here, will I?

00:25:10.022 --> 00:25:12.047
That's how and then they used that part

00:25:12.325 --> 00:25:14.192
for mesmerizing and this and that

00:25:14.340 --> 00:25:16.286
and that's how the tantrism started.

00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.060
As a result of this tantrism just after

00:25:21.294 --> 00:25:22.960
Adi Shankaracharya's death

00:25:23.601 --> 00:25:25.562
the tantrikas just came out

00:25:25.687 --> 00:25:27.960
just like snakes coming out of the grass.

00:25:28.144 --> 00:25:31.237
And they spread the tantrism right from Konark

00:25:31.663 --> 00:25:33.714
all through on that whole

00:25:34.277 --> 00:25:36.605
I should say the whole patta of it, the whole

00:25:36.960 --> 00:25:40.960
line from there up to Surat, up to down like that

00:25:42.118 --> 00:25:43.960
the whole of it, they covered.

00:25:44.053 --> 00:25:46.193
They could not cross into Maharashtra, thank God

00:25:46.218 --> 00:25:49.267
because Maharashtra is, you have to come up and then go

00:25:49.463 --> 00:25:51.564
into the plateau so they didn't come.

00:25:51.809 --> 00:25:55.167
But the whole thing they covered, above the river Narmada,

00:25:55.964 --> 00:25:57.261
above the river Tapi

00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.239
they covered all that area,  Madhya Pradesh,

00:26:00.308 --> 00:26:02.512
you see, all the Raja, Maharajas all of them

00:26:02.725 --> 00:26:03.521
were involved.

00:26:04.039 --> 00:26:06.960
And what they did was to play a trick with the Raja, Maharaja

00:26:07.055 --> 00:26:10.380
Just  because they had Jain, Jain people.

00:26:11.081 --> 00:26:17.614
as what you call ministers or mantris.

00:26:17.911 --> 00:26:19.419
And the mantris said

00:26:19.614 --> 00:26:21.364
that we want to build temples.

00:26:22.457 --> 00:26:25.554
So these Rajas, Maharajas were all under these tantrikas.

00:26:26.388 --> 00:26:28.247
So the Raja, Maharajas said, all right.

00:26:28.272 --> 00:26:30.982
if you can put these erotics outside, I am willing to do.

00:26:32.665 --> 00:26:35.055
So they said but why do you want to put the erotics.

00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:37.298
They were very clever people these mantricas.

00:26:37.323 --> 00:26:38.657
so they said, No.

00:26:38.805 --> 00:26:40.960
You can put these things outside

00:26:41.074 --> 00:26:42.902
because that is life.

00:26:43.663 --> 00:26:44.822
we must show the life

00:26:44.923 --> 00:26:49.007
and they put in very big, sort what you call the very big

00:26:50.866 --> 00:26:52.249
competition.

00:26:52.491 --> 00:26:54.429
They put a very big competition

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.081
and then that competition they tried to defeat

00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:04.960
say sort of one, one organization working here in

00:27:04.985 --> 00:27:06.516
in competition with the another

00:27:06.541 --> 00:27:07.960
then there should be a defeat

00:27:08.001 --> 00:27:09.368
and one is defeated,

00:27:09.393 --> 00:27:11.391
that was not given a chance to produce.

00:27:11.672 --> 00:27:13.960
So the artist also got involved into it.

00:27:14.207 --> 00:27:15.957
But still in the,

00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:18.543
I should say in the, Madhya Pradesh

00:27:18.703 --> 00:27:21.109
now these places, the artists were still dharmic

00:27:21.233 --> 00:27:24.931
because they made the all these erotic figures

00:27:25.216 --> 00:27:27.724
with lanky- panky bodies, you see,

00:27:27.867 --> 00:27:30.344
and very funny looking bodies

00:27:30.623 --> 00:27:31.697
like sick people.

00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:34.385
and the Gods and Goddesses are very thick

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.120
so you don't see them, I mean, normally

00:27:36.145 --> 00:27:37.960
you don't see them where are they hanging.

00:27:39.244 --> 00:27:41.319
And the same architecture

00:27:41.686 --> 00:27:44.812
because it was in the thing was brought

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:48.460
in your country, in your side also, in Madras.

00:27:48.765 --> 00:27:50.132
And in Madras temples

00:27:50.157 --> 00:27:52.730
what they did was to put all these erotic outside

00:27:53.089 --> 00:27:56.960
and they called this is fertility cult, fertility cult.

00:27:57.824 --> 00:28:00.920
And on your temples if you see these small, small figures

00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:02.274
they are all those.

00:28:03.454 --> 00:28:06.268
So how far this negativity has gone

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.774
to spoil say like if you go.

00:28:08.805 --> 00:28:11.089
to the temple of, say,

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:15.547
Tirupati, Tirupati where sakshat

00:28:15.974 --> 00:28:18.133
it is, it is there outside,

00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:20.831
of the temples these Brahmins have put all these things

00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960
on the door if you see.

00:28:23.248 --> 00:28:25.162
Imagine to be put erotics!

00:28:25.373 --> 00:28:27.725
Even in Jaggannath Puri

00:28:27.836 --> 00:28:29.735
all over they have put these

00:28:29.891 --> 00:28:31.609
and we don't understand.

00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.960
The Konark temple the whole thing was so horrible

00:28:36.099 --> 00:28:39.013
because the architect himself was a tantrik.

00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.768
There's no temple, nothing.

00:28:41.974 --> 00:28:44.691
What he has done he's made all these horrible things

00:28:44.716 --> 00:28:47.455
and put them in the shape of a temple, there's no temple.

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:49.158
And he said that on top of this

00:28:49.184 --> 00:28:51.659
I want to put one very big magnet

00:28:51.684 --> 00:28:53.761
so that all the ships will be attracted.

00:28:53.786 --> 00:28:55.300
So the king agreed to that

00:28:56.387 --> 00:28:57.640
and he gave lot of money

00:28:57.665 --> 00:28:59.960
and that is how the Konark temple was built.

00:29:01.189 --> 00:29:03.695
Now the Nepal temple was built

00:29:03.765 --> 00:29:05.648
when the artist would not accept this.

00:29:05.673 --> 00:29:07.732
They have seen, see this is made out of

00:29:07.892 --> 00:29:10.060
kashtha means out of wood

00:29:10.412 --> 00:29:13.186
and if the Vishnumaya

00:29:13.257 --> 00:29:16.452
falls upon it means the lightning

00:29:16.609 --> 00:29:17.960
then it will be all burnt

00:29:18.585 --> 00:29:21.039
so best thing is to keep Her attention out.

00:29:21.402 --> 00:29:22.935
Why not we make some erotics

00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:25.678
so that She doesn't come because She is a virgin.

00:29:25.913 --> 00:29:27.694
So, poor artist agreed to it

00:29:27.719 --> 00:29:29.126
and they made those.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:31.960
But when we Indians go to a temple,

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.446
we never see this, you see

00:29:33.471 --> 00:29:35.015
you must have escaped in your temples

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.438
you must not have seen this.

00:29:36.972 --> 00:29:39.224
But if you see the foreigners then you will know,

00:29:39.249 --> 00:29:41.666
where they are, because they have zoom lenses you see.

00:29:41.691 --> 00:29:45.207
They'll climb over. I've seen in, in Nepal

00:29:45.601 --> 00:29:48.206
you see they, once I when I went there

00:29:48.315 --> 00:29:51.172
so Gregoire, I said, "Gregoire where are the erotics sites.

00:29:51.197 --> 00:29:53.980
I don't see anything  where are the erotics?"

00:29:54.207 --> 00:29:56.697
So, they said, "Oh! You can't see the erotics?"

00:29:56.722 --> 00:29:59.274
I said, "No." He said, "See those Japanese."

00:29:59.477 --> 00:30:02.336
The Japanese has had put up, you see, big, big

00:30:02.484 --> 00:30:03.960
what you call

00:30:06.678 --> 00:30:09.550
Staircase, which is automatic, Yogi: Ladder

00:30:09.694 --> 00:30:11.566
Ladders but ladders

00:30:11.591 --> 00:30:14.245
of a very see the ...

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:15.507
alertness

00:30:15.624 --> 00:30:18.609
the ladders but not this like escalator

00:30:18.834 --> 00:30:21.392
see, they were like escalators, huge big things.

00:30:21.748 --> 00:30:23.657
They brought all these from Japan

00:30:23.829 --> 00:30:25.011
and put it up

00:30:25.168 --> 00:30:26.449
and took the photograph.

00:30:26.678 --> 00:30:28.055
You see, they were taking photographs.

00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.562
Then I saw all the machinery going on What's that?

00:30:30.703 --> 00:30:33.438
They said and zoom lenses, you see, big, big lenses.

00:30:33.951 --> 00:30:34.930
Nonsense.

00:30:35.225 --> 00:30:37.755
Big. I mean they brought all the machinery all the way.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.097
This is what happens.

00:30:43.355 --> 00:30:44.960
Then we had other religions

00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:47.960
which tried to, sort of, neutralize it like Jainism

00:30:48.592 --> 00:30:50.407
that went into another nonsense.

00:30:50.616 --> 00:30:52.376
Jainism is another nonsense

00:30:52.792 --> 00:30:55.905
because, you see, at the time of Shri Krishna, Neminath

00:30:55.944 --> 00:30:57.792
is the one, who opposed,

00:30:57.916 --> 00:30:58.971
Neminath opposed,

00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:04.192
Shri Krishna for one thing because He said

00:31:04.403 --> 00:31:05.960
He believes in hinsa.

00:31:06.254 --> 00:31:08.135
Because in Gita when they say the

00:31:08.255 --> 00:31:10.321
Krishna has taught ahinsa I'm surprised.

00:31:10.368 --> 00:31:12.388
He taught hinsa.

00:31:14.172 --> 00:31:16.805
You know Karna, when his foot was caught up

00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:22.952
in the wheel so  Karna

00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:26.960
Arjuna, you see, raised his gandiva on him

00:31:27.154 --> 00:31:30.408
so,Karna said, "See, you are a veera, I'm a veera."

00:31:30.565 --> 00:31:31.960
and how can you kill,

00:31:31.985 --> 00:31:34.151
a nishastra (without any arms) veera

00:31:34.826 --> 00:31:37.390
See! So then Krishna pointed His finger like this,

00:31:37.415 --> 00:31:38.194
and He said,

00:31:38.601 --> 00:31:41.960
"When, where was your veerta, where was your bravery

00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.511
when Draupadi's laaj (chastity) was taken?"

00:31:45.052 --> 00:31:46.511
He said, "You kill him, now."

00:31:47.045 --> 00:31:49.307
Where did He teach ahinsa I don't know?

00:31:49.405 --> 00:31:52.063
Stupidity to think that He teached ahinsa.

00:31:52.932 --> 00:31:55.866
He preached that who is so ever is dushta,

00:31:55.891 --> 00:31:58.335
who is wrong should be killed by God.

00:31:59.538 --> 00:32:02.407
and by the people who are following God.

00:32:02.453 --> 00:32:04.750
Like Arjuna, the very beginning of it is

00:32:04.821 --> 00:32:05.960
he went into Kaivalya.

00:32:06.608 --> 00:32:08.855
He said,"Oh! I don't want to kill anybody,

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:10.920
be there's my guru, there's my brother

00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.960
there's my sisters this, that."

00:32:13.366 --> 00:32:17.392
So Shri Krishna said, "What they are already killed,

00:32:17.822 --> 00:32:20.344
In the name of dharma you have to kill them."

00:32:22.189 --> 00:32:24.555
And here these stupid these Jains

00:32:24.891 --> 00:32:26.960
are looking after the mosquitoes

00:32:27.784 --> 00:32:29.701
and looking after the bugs.

00:32:30.252 --> 00:32:32.195
They put some bugs in a hut

00:32:32.234 --> 00:32:33.960
that's good for the brahmins of course

00:32:34.078 --> 00:32:35.931
and give some money to the brahmins

00:32:36.126 --> 00:32:38.360
and the bugs have to take all the blood,

00:32:39.013 --> 00:32:40.613
eat the blood of the brahmins,

00:32:40.753 --> 00:32:43.558
and then they give the money to the brahmin.

00:32:43.678 --> 00:32:45.703
But the worst is you know, now,

00:32:46.647 --> 00:32:48.632
in Bombay there's a problem because

00:32:48.995 --> 00:32:51.821
they take all their filth

00:32:52.243 --> 00:32:55.212
not in the bathroom or anything but they put it on some hill

00:32:55.610 --> 00:32:58.251
because the kitanoos (germs) must come out,

00:32:58.751 --> 00:33:00.706
the germs must come out.

00:33:02.846 --> 00:33:04.265
This is Shwetambaras only

00:33:05.164 --> 00:33:07.851
but the silliest are the Digambaras

00:33:08.537 --> 00:33:10.399
You see, they are the worst of it.

00:33:10.816 --> 00:33:13.625
I mean once what happened that

00:33:17.364 --> 00:33:19.323
Shri Mahavira was meditating.

00:33:19.769 --> 00:33:23.603
While coming out his cloth got cut,

00:33:23.838 --> 00:33:25.200
caught up in one kunja.

00:33:26.256 --> 00:33:28.989
When his cloth caught up in the kunja

00:33:29.114 --> 00:33:31.366
what he did was to

00:33:34.163 --> 00:33:36.323
cut it out, because he thought how to get out

00:33:36.394 --> 00:33:37.855
so he cut half of his cloth

00:33:38.097 --> 00:33:39.960
near a half cloth on his body.

00:33:40.755 --> 00:33:43.707
But then Shri Krishna went just to take his pareeksha (test)

00:33:43.732 --> 00:33:46.151
and He said, "Now, see, you are a avdhoota,

00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.840
why do you need a cloth upon yourself,

00:33:47.865 --> 00:33:50.087
I'm a nude person you give Me something?”

00:33:50.251 --> 00:33:51.632
So he gave Him that.

00:33:52.186 --> 00:33:54.858
Just for a minute because he was a king's son,

00:33:55.035 --> 00:33:57.048
he didn't have to do anything and he went back

00:33:57.305 --> 00:34:00.099
he hid himself and he went back and he wore his dress.

00:34:00.537 --> 00:34:03.960
Now, these people are horrible like this Mahabali and all that

00:34:04.278 --> 00:34:06.566
making all the details about it it's horrid,

00:34:06.668 --> 00:34:10.562
people they're insulting him all the time.

00:34:13.680 --> 00:34:15.960
But if you see like William Blake,

00:34:15.985 --> 00:34:18.237
he  has made pictures of human beings,

00:34:18.307 --> 00:34:19.960
not showing any parts other that

00:34:20.098 --> 00:34:21.858
but in a nude way,

00:34:22.357 --> 00:34:25.914
when he makes the God or makes anybody Mary or Christ,

00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:26.960
covers them.

00:34:28.147 --> 00:34:30.060
Same with Michaelangelo.

00:34:33.701 --> 00:34:35.070
But I don't understand

00:34:35.289 --> 00:34:36.578
these horrible Jains.

00:34:36.603 --> 00:34:38.960
They want to show Gods, as nude

00:34:40.345 --> 00:34:41.334
and fight for that.

00:34:41.912 --> 00:34:43.960
The worse is they're fighting, that's the good part

00:34:45.576 --> 00:34:46.850
so much fighting that.

00:34:48.261 --> 00:34:50.095
I want to tell you My own experience

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:52.156
but it was horrid one day I'll tell you that

00:34:52.906 --> 00:34:54.390
First time when I saw them

00:34:55.146 --> 00:34:56.297
they were terrible mess.

00:34:56.522 --> 00:34:57.930
Alright, so now

00:34:58.063 --> 00:34:59.766
it has reached such a stage

00:34:59.854 --> 00:35:01.831
that there is one Parshavnath's

00:35:02.355 --> 00:35:05.163
thing was found out somewhere, some old statue,

00:35:05.749 --> 00:35:07.960
so there was a fight going on in the,

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:12.684
is the place where Indra was given realization.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.561
This place, his chhidra (pierced) was made here

00:35:17.586 --> 00:35:19.323
that's why we call it chidendra

00:35:19.369 --> 00:35:20.960
see this chhidra was being here

00:35:21.332 --> 00:35:23.965
but actually he's Shuchendra, he was made Shuchi.

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.248
This is at the time

00:35:26.403 --> 00:35:27.809
of Prahlada

00:35:28.749 --> 00:35:30.372
that this Indra,

00:35:31.403 --> 00:35:33.428
when the mother was pregnant,

00:35:33.459 --> 00:35:35.490
she.. he wanted to help her.

00:35:35.853 --> 00:35:37.397
So he brought her

00:35:37.422 --> 00:35:39.265
to Shandilya muni's place.

00:35:39.428 --> 00:35:43.161
Now this Shandilya muni, Shandilya is My family, My gotra

00:35:43.440 --> 00:35:44.960
My father's, Shalivahanas,

00:35:44.997 --> 00:35:46.295
gotra is shandily

00:35:46.545 --> 00:35:49.263
and he brought that one in Shandilya's ashram.

00:35:49.727 --> 00:35:53.091
Now the land we have got in Neera is that ashram

00:35:54.212 --> 00:35:55.567
just imagine sahaja

00:35:55.592 --> 00:35:56.960
that is the land we have got.

00:35:57.396 --> 00:35:59.842
And then now it has come out in the newspapers

00:35:59.960 --> 00:36:02.960
for somebody went and did the research after I purchased the land

00:36:03.892 --> 00:36:06.696
that this, there was, a

00:36:08.999 --> 00:36:12.204
meeting between the Neera river and the river

00:36:28.499 --> 00:36:31.526
some King came all the way here and built that.

00:36:31.678 --> 00:36:33.375
So imagine, the Shalivahanaas knew

00:36:33.400 --> 00:36:34.999
the Neera is going to come in them,

00:36:35.024 --> 00:36:36.972
I'm called as Neera in My family,

00:36:37.293 --> 00:36:39.702
and on that Neera river, we have got this land.

00:36:40.343 --> 00:36:42.694
And this also with a very mysterious thing

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:43.960
because you see, one man

00:36:44.679 --> 00:36:46.695
had given this land to the government

00:36:47.615 --> 00:36:50.064
see and this land I wanted, I liked it.

00:36:50.322 --> 00:36:52.228
He said, 'The government won't release it,

00:36:52.253 --> 00:36:53.731
how can You have this land?'

00:36:53.756 --> 00:36:54.960
I said I want to have this land only

00:36:55.014 --> 00:36:58.134
people didn't understand why I wanted that land, I insisted

00:36:58.159 --> 00:37:00.273
Then they said, the government won't release.

00:37:00.298 --> 00:37:02.070
But suddenly he got a letter one day

00:37:02.095 --> 00:37:04.469
saying that government think they've taken a surplus land

00:37:04.494 --> 00:37:05.254
this land is yours.

00:37:06.402 --> 00:37:08.656
So he sold it to us and that's how we got it.

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.935
Now Prahlada was born there.

00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.851
He lived there till five years of age

00:37:12.944 --> 00:37:14.898
and used to go and play there.

00:37:15.381 --> 00:37:18.640
Then Shandilya muni told Indra

00:37:18.862 --> 00:37:20.545
that you leave this lady here

00:37:20.570 --> 00:37:23.175
because out of her will come out Prahlada.

00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:25.960
He brings forth the promised Narsimha avtara.

00:37:26.413 --> 00:37:28.667
So you just don't worry and you go South.

00:37:28.692 --> 00:37:31.719
and there he came and he got the Shuchindra here

00:37:32.429 --> 00:37:33.974
That's how he got realization.

00:37:34.334 --> 00:37:35.920
Now this Prahlada

00:37:37.118 --> 00:37:39.105
went there you know what happened then

00:37:39.144 --> 00:37:41.289
but here about

00:37:41.374 --> 00:37:43.764
Peshwai time they tried to build

00:37:43.886 --> 00:37:46.197
a temple of Narsimha

00:37:46.678 --> 00:37:48.935
and they spent lot of money to fill up the place

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:51.055
and they did it but they could not do much

00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:52.684
about the temple it was half done.

00:37:53.012 --> 00:37:55.280
Then one fellow about three hundred years back

00:37:55.366 --> 00:37:57.935
decided to collect some money to build the temple

00:37:57.960 --> 00:37:58.920
and  he built the temple.

00:37:58.945 --> 00:38:00.920
In his dream came Prahlada and he told him

00:38:01.029 --> 00:38:02.687
that I have already made

00:38:02.742 --> 00:38:04.280
the statue of Narsimha

00:38:04.561 --> 00:38:06.182
on the river Neera,

00:38:06.207 --> 00:38:08.239
you go and find it on the bank you'll find.

00:38:08.264 --> 00:38:10.000
He went there and he saw the statue

00:38:10.914 --> 00:38:13.448
made out of ordinary sand

00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:15.724
for so many years it's there.

00:38:15.927 --> 00:38:18.349
He picked it up brought it and it's back there

00:38:18.521 --> 00:38:21.790
and it is still there full of vibrations, see the vibrations.

00:38:23.299 --> 00:38:24.298
We have seen it.

00:38:24.498 --> 00:38:28.040
And in that temple there is on top of the gopuram

00:38:28.126 --> 00:38:30.231
you see a little dhara (stream)

00:38:30.256 --> 00:38:32.000
of water coming all the time.

00:38:33.859 --> 00:38:36.910
We have so many still, so many miracles in this country

00:38:38.222 --> 00:38:40.762
but we should go deep into it to find out.

00:38:40.834 --> 00:38:43.623
instead of that like stupid fools we are just

00:38:43.758 --> 00:38:46.747
running after these so called brahmins.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:52.583
So the depth and the greatness of

00:38:53.091 --> 00:38:57.289
what should you say, the Indian seers

00:38:57.351 --> 00:39:00.960
and the rishis and munis was lost like this by these

00:39:01.115 --> 00:39:03.657
so called mushroom people.

00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:06.313
Now it is for Sahaja Yogies

00:39:06.721 --> 00:39:09.880
who have to find out all these things, put them on record

00:39:09.953 --> 00:39:11.711
and have to boldly tell them

00:39:12.197 --> 00:39:14.195
that we have had enough of you now

00:39:14.280 --> 00:39:16.866
let us take over all the temples.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.840
Only the brahmins can enter

00:39:20.117 --> 00:39:21.923
you are the only brahmins I see

00:39:22.093 --> 00:39:23.477
Where are the brahmins?

00:39:23.662 --> 00:39:25.731
Like once in Puna

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:29.960
they had a program arranged for in a

00:39:30.421 --> 00:39:33.738
place called Rajwade karyalaya.

00:39:34.141 --> 00:39:35.863
This Rajwade is a brahmin

00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:39.935
and Rajwade was told later on that no no no

00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:41.960
this Mataji is not a brahmin how can you have it here?

00:39:43.319 --> 00:39:46.549
So these, the boys never told Me anything they said alright if

00:39:46.574 --> 00:39:49.415
you say so we won't have the program

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.415
but we'll have to announce in the newspaper that

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:54.335
because She's not a brahmin that's why you're not allowing Her.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:55.935
He said, "No, no that you can't do.

00:39:55.960 --> 00:39:58.643
He said, "Then what are you to say,what is the reason?"

00:39:58.749 --> 00:40:01.015
So they got a fright. They said,

00:40:01.070 --> 00:40:02.578
"Alright, let us have it."

00:40:02.679 --> 00:40:05.201
So when I was having it, I don't know why,I said,

00:40:05.226 --> 00:40:08.255
Those who think you are brahmins come here in front of Me."

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.960
Four five of them came, started shaking like this way.

00:40:10.985 --> 00:40:12.375
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:15.429
They said, "No, we accept You're Shakti, stop it, stop it."

00:40:15.483 --> 00:40:17.778
I said, "But I'm Shakti nobody is shaking."

00:40:17.803 --> 00:40:20.402
"No, there are people sitting here, they are also shaking."

00:40:20.544 --> 00:40:21.949
I said, "Call them."

00:40:22.226 --> 00:40:24.227
I said , "Go and ask, who are they?"

00:40:24.438 --> 00:40:26.840
They are certified mad from Thane

00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:29.187
were sent by the district man.

00:40:29.695 --> 00:40:33.608
These brahmins got a fright of their life.

00:40:33.633 --> 00:40:35.335
I said, "That's what you are,

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:38.722
you have to go to Thane now, that's the only place for you."

00:40:38.821 --> 00:40:41.962
And our Rajwade was sitting on top there,

00:40:42.071 --> 00:40:46.491
all sort of caught up

00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:48.440
by some sort of an arthritis.

00:40:49.100 --> 00:40:51.310
I said, "Rajwade, come down now."

00:40:51.343 --> 00:40:53.185
He 'I'm also a brahmin, he says from

00:40:53.210 --> 00:40:54.753
I said, "Alright, you come down."

00:40:54.778 --> 00:40:57.469
Say, "I can't, I can't even walk." I said, "Get up and walk."

00:40:57.616 --> 00:41:00.315
He's the one who just got up and walked.

00:41:00.521 --> 00:41:02.681
came down, then he was so good.

00:41:02.782 --> 00:41:04.955
He started going on a cycle.

00:41:05.123 --> 00:41:06.935
That time he was sixty five.

00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:10.811
Everyday he used to go and do work in all the villages, this that

00:41:10.836 --> 00:41:13.432
I told him, "Stop it now, you shouldn't over do it also,

00:41:13.457 --> 00:41:15.026
it's too much, he won't stop."

00:41:15.247 --> 00:41:17.935
And then he started catching from people this, that,

00:41:17.960 --> 00:41:19.895
he got sick, again I cured him again,

00:41:19.920 --> 00:41:21.681
I cured him, so many times it happened.

00:41:21.743 --> 00:41:23.960
But I think ultimately he lost one foot,

00:41:24.304 --> 00:41:26.336
one foot he's lost,  little bit.

00:41:26.696 --> 00:41:29.674
But that's what it is, so he never listened to Me.

00:41:29.959 --> 00:41:31.962
What I'm trying to tell you is this

00:41:31.987 --> 00:41:35.220
this is how our great Hindu

00:41:35.569 --> 00:41:38.898
or we can say, Hindu word I don't want to use because

00:41:38.997 --> 00:41:40.798
it has nothing to do with us.

00:41:40.918 --> 00:41:43.149
This word was given to us by Alexander

00:41:43.765 --> 00:41:45.852
because he crossed the river Sindhu

00:41:45.877 --> 00:41:47.593
he didn't, couldn't say Sindhu, you see,

00:41:47.618 --> 00:41:50.087
'sa' he could not say, so he called it Hindu.

00:41:50.745 --> 00:41:52.933
Sindhu Hindu, see

00:41:53.263 --> 00:41:55.942
And then he came down from there

00:41:55.967 --> 00:41:58.317
and that's how we become Indians, you see.

00:41:58.433 --> 00:42:01.099
So, they don't know how to pronounce many words, you see,

00:42:01.124 --> 00:42:04.911
so that's how they couldn't call Bombay, Mumbai.

00:42:04.936 --> 00:42:06.802
so they use to called it Bombay.

00:42:06.827 --> 00:42:10.142
See, but Mumbai is a very big word it means primordial Mother.

00:42:11.350 --> 00:42:12.869
She's the mother of Mumba

00:42:12.995 --> 00:42:16.413
and Mumba is the mother Amba, is Mumba.

00:42:16.694 --> 00:42:18.920
And She's the mother of, who is that?

00:42:19.239 --> 00:42:22.457
That's the Mahakali that's the Primordial Mother.

00:42:23.749 --> 00:42:26.274
They couldn't pronounce that word so they called it Bombay.

00:42:27.218 --> 00:42:29.149
That's how we've got Bombay and all those

00:42:29.174 --> 00:42:31.457
all words were ruined by them. All right!

00:42:31.764 --> 00:42:33.324
So this is the situation is.

00:42:33.475 --> 00:42:35.656
Now today's first thing we have to know

00:42:35.756 --> 00:42:38.173
that we are facing a very

00:42:38.741 --> 00:42:40.600
great crowds of mudhas,

00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.721
who're stuck up, stuck up there

00:42:43.933 --> 00:42:45.912
roots are dead

00:42:46.011 --> 00:42:49.662
and they 're stuck up like dead deep root somewhere.

00:42:50.358 --> 00:42:52.170
So to shake them is not easy,

00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.560
talk to them is not easy,

00:42:54.647 --> 00:42:56.935
to convince them is not at all easy because they think

00:42:56.960 --> 00:43:00.935
see they are all wise, Madrasies think they are the wisest.

00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.901
people as far as religion is concerned

00:43:03.065 --> 00:43:05.346
and I don't know where to look when they say that.

00:43:05.457 --> 00:43:06.957
See this is the trouble is.

00:43:07.098 --> 00:43:10.425
So with that understanding if you face

00:43:10.667 --> 00:43:15.170
because also, I think, Venugopalan told Me,

00:43:15.327 --> 00:43:18.219
"Mother, I'm sure it won't happen

00:43:18.250 --> 00:43:19.960
to the real Tamilians."

00:43:20.221 --> 00:43:22.355
I said, "Why?" He said, "They're no good,

00:43:22.467 --> 00:43:23.712
they can never get it,

00:43:23.737 --> 00:43:25.845
because I'm a Tamilian I know what it is."

00:43:25.881 --> 00:43:27.866
So I said, "Cannot happen to Tamilians?"

00:43:27.945 --> 00:43:30.055
He said, "No, because Murthy is not a Tamilian,

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:31.055
Jayakar is not a Tamilian.

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.356
They cannot be Tamilians.

00:43:32.381 --> 00:43:35.360
" I said, "Let's see the Tamilians also."

00:43:37.545 --> 00:43:40.606
He just could not think that Tamilians can take to it

00:43:40.842 --> 00:43:43.761
He said they are so dead into it, they cannot.

00:43:44.044 --> 00:43:47.097
We have so many now Tamilians also in

00:43:47.646 --> 00:43:52.037
Delhi but how many come to us, very few.

00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:04.960
So,

00:44:08.360 --> 00:44:10.200
Can you open the fan now?

00:44:14.240 --> 00:44:17.333
You start, who else will start.

00:44:20.506 --> 00:44:23.090
Can put that also. It's al   right, it won't go.

00:44:29.506 --> 00:44:31.879
Not so much you can put it little less

00:44:31.994 --> 00:44:33.414
you see, little movement.

00:44:34.157 --> 00:44:37.927
You didn't feel the hot, till the electricity had not come.

00:44:37.952 --> 00:44:39.554
Do you notice that?

00:44:41.048 --> 00:44:42.375
Didn't feel the hot at all.

00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:45.551
As soon as the electricity has come you have started feeling hot.

00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:52.024
I told him, "You don't worry I'll throw cold at them,

00:44:52.049 --> 00:44:53.211
they won't feel."

00:44:54.866 --> 00:44:55.935
None of you felt.

00:44:55.960 --> 00:44:58.749
As soon as the electricity has come you're feeling hot.

00:45:04.819 --> 00:45:06.126
What have you got?

00:45:06.258 --> 00:45:07.251
What is this?

00:45:09.604 --> 00:45:11.782
Kammer patta (Waist Belt ornament, worn around the waist).

00:45:11.960 --> 00:45:12.960
No that green coloured

00:45:13.200 --> 00:45:15.440
Yogi: That is. S M: Yes? Yogi: It's Tulsi.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.200
Yogi - Its a Tulsi (Herb basil)

00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:29.840
Yogi - Its a Tulsi (Herb)

00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.960
Yogi: Pachu (Precious Stones)  S M Anh?

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.360
Yogi: Madras people come into the front.

00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.400
Yogi: Madras people to come.

00:45:41.360 --> 00:45:42.960
Yogi:Dawana( Fragrant Herb)

00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.960
Yogi: Its a Dawana,   S M :Its a Dawana

00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:52.960
S M: That is not Dawana

00:45:57.440 --> 00:46:00.040
Dawana and Tulasi ( Herbs)

00:46:03.440 --> 00:46:04.320
It is Dawana

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:16.960
It is Dawana

00:46:17.160 --> 00:46:18.400
Where is Tulsi ? Tulsi is less

00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.320
Yogi: Some is not Tulsi. SM: Huh

00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:29.440
Smelling nice

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:35.960
Yogi: Which flowers are these? S M: Its Ok

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:38.960
All right!

00:46:43.824 --> 00:46:46.156
There's one thing we are missed on this,

00:46:47.971 --> 00:46:51.242
which I want to tell you about the Vedas now, as I told you

00:46:52.031 --> 00:46:54.440
In one lecture you can't cover the whole thing but in short

00:46:55.537 --> 00:46:57.573
that how they went into the

00:46:58.308 --> 00:47:01.295
abstraction of the chakras. Some might, might say

00:47:01.545 --> 00:47:03.514
that they didn't talk about the chakras,

00:47:03.764 --> 00:47:05.400
you see, because this is what they are

00:47:05.813 --> 00:47:08.368
it, it's not in the Vedas, it should not be anywhere else.

00:47:08.584 --> 00:47:11.493
I mean supposing in the beginning that was the situation

00:47:12.092 --> 00:47:13.739
then today this is the situation.

00:47:13.764 --> 00:47:17.375
Like, when a electricity started

00:47:17.400 --> 00:47:20.148
nobody knew much about, it they could hardly put

00:47:20.173 --> 00:47:23.628
a little flickering light, now today

00:47:23.698 --> 00:47:26.027
we have this, we have that, we don't refuse this

00:47:26.080 --> 00:47:27.960
because it was not there so it should not be there

00:47:28.095 --> 00:47:29.666
You see evolving and it is

00:47:29.826 --> 00:47:31.966
in aware, our awareness, it is coming.

00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.855
But they will always say, it's not written in that book.

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.159
Book and that not into that.

00:47:35.574 --> 00:47:38.960
First time somebody wrote about Kundalini was actually

00:47:38.985 --> 00:47:42.306
I should say in a real sense of the word wrote properly

00:47:42.467 --> 00:47:44.178
was Adi Shankaracharya himself

00:47:44.554 --> 00:47:47.616
and then our, what you call, Gyaneshwara

00:47:47.725 --> 00:47:48.960
because that was the time

00:47:49.065 --> 00:47:50.960
and before that of course

00:47:51.275 --> 00:47:54.486
Markandeya wrote it, thousands of years back but

00:47:54.551 --> 00:47:57.689
who considered Markandeya as something, no one listened to him.

00:47:58.080 --> 00:48:00.375
So if the Vedas become everything they will say

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.935
then what about your chakras, there's nothing in the Vedas.

00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:05.215
So it could be in some other books.

00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:08.223
Now Bhrigusamhita has written,

00:48:08.598 --> 00:48:11.660
Bhrigu has written a book called Nadi Granth, in that

00:48:11.685 --> 00:48:13.677
he has described complete sahaja yoga.

00:48:13.732 --> 00:48:15.960
He said that Kundalini will rise and this will happen.

00:48:16.213 --> 00:48:18.550
So the knowledge of the Kundalini we had since long

00:48:18.575 --> 00:48:20.831
but it was kept as a secret

00:48:22.052 --> 00:48:24.791
and was not discussed by the Sushumna people

00:48:26.443 --> 00:48:27.610
and they are the ones

00:48:27.635 --> 00:48:30.317
who formed this Machindernath, Gorakhnath all these people.

00:48:30.520 --> 00:48:33.552
Most of this work was done in Maharashtra.

00:48:33.702 --> 00:48:35.705
Most of it was done in Maharashtra

00:48:35.822 --> 00:48:38.783
and that's how we have the Sushumna path in the central path

00:48:39.006 --> 00:48:43.095
of ascent or realization was kept as a secret

00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:45.354
and we can say that there were two,

00:48:45.952 --> 00:48:48.180
two or one or two flowers

00:48:48.555 --> 00:48:49.960
one or two flowers

00:48:51.294 --> 00:48:53.073
on the tree of life

00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:55.960
but now we have many flowers.

00:48:56.360 --> 00:48:57.711
That's how we can tell.

00:48:57.915 --> 00:49:00.109
Then the essence how they discussed is that

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:01.840
see, what they say "bhu"

00:49:02.688 --> 00:49:05.905
Bhu is the essence

00:49:05.930 --> 00:49:09.863
of Mooladhara- made from the Prithvi tattwa.

00:49:10.821 --> 00:49:13.323
Bhurva is the antriksh.

00:49:13.791 --> 00:49:17.672
Bhurva is the essence by which it was made the Bhurva.

00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:21.656
was made the antriksha, means all the elements and all that,

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:23.366
is Brahmdeva's job.

00:49:23.741 --> 00:49:25.960
You call it Brahmdeva or Bhurva is the same,

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.087
is the shakti of Brahmdeva is Bhurva.

00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:32.960
So Bhu Bhurva Swaha.

00:49:33.702 --> 00:49:35.116
the stomach is Swaha

00:49:35.444 --> 00:49:40.386
The shakti of the stomach is Swaha.

00:49:41.089 --> 00:49:42.960
Swaha is what

00:49:44.210 --> 00:49:49.000
to take everything in, burn it, digest it, swaha

00:49:50.474 --> 00:49:54.702
Then 'Manaha' is the essence of the

00:49:54.835 --> 00:49:56.560
heart chakra is manaha

00:49:57.280 --> 00:49:59.323
is mana, is the emotions

00:49:59.694 --> 00:50:03.758
is the mana, is the Parmesh God's emotions.

00:50:03.960 --> 00:50:07.905
is in the heart is Jagdamba there.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.960
Mana Jana

00:50:10.892 --> 00:50:13.053
is Shri Krishna, is for the jana.

00:50:14.412 --> 00:50:17.654
Jana is when Shri Krishna came on this Earth,

00:50:18.396 --> 00:50:20.347
when He thought of the people.

00:50:20.488 --> 00:50:23.781
He mixed with the people, He talked to them, He tried to spread

00:50:23.806 --> 00:50:27.633
and He's the Virata, so He is a collective,

00:50:27.672 --> 00:50:28.960
He's the collective being -

00:50:29.686 --> 00:50:33.152
so Jana Tapa, Tapa is Shri Christ

00:50:33.418 --> 00:50:35.960
because He went into tapaswita.

00:50:36.293 --> 00:50:37.920
His life was a tapasya,

00:50:38.105 --> 00:50:39.336
He went into tapa

00:50:39.783 --> 00:50:41.359
and the last is Satya,

00:50:41.396 --> 00:50:43.610
at the Sahasrara you know the truth.

00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:50.211
So all these seven things

00:50:50.579 --> 00:50:52.960
essence of all the chakras they are describing over here,

00:50:53.577 --> 00:50:55.413
in the Vedas

00:50:56.740 --> 00:50:57.959
but these, they will argue,

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:01.840
they'll say the mantra of Gayatri, this, that, what is that ?

00:51:02.224 --> 00:51:04.421
Gayatri is the essence

00:51:07.960 --> 00:51:09.485
and that's the trouble with them is.

00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:11.618
By saying these mantras they go to the right side

00:51:11.643 --> 00:51:12.960
they are not there on the essence.

00:51:13.212 --> 00:51:14.589
the whole thing get's spoilt.

00:51:15.706 --> 00:51:17.448
Specially in Kashmir, I must say,

00:51:17.604 --> 00:51:19.704
they suffer from this Gayatri mantra.

00:51:22.790 --> 00:51:25.108
And the worst thing, that has happened to us

00:51:25.133 --> 00:51:27.960
now I don't know about other places but specially in Maharashtra

00:51:28.312 --> 00:51:31.689
we are two types of horrible Brahmins

00:51:32.048 --> 00:51:35.087
and there are other very good types of Brahmins also.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:36.840
But the bad ones I'm telling

00:51:37.342 --> 00:51:40.763
the ones who, who look after the temples

00:51:41.029 --> 00:51:42.776
and manage the temples

00:51:42.907 --> 00:51:45.624
and they think, Oh! we know what is God is,

00:51:46.019 --> 00:51:48.313
there's nothing like or we have made this God,

00:51:48.360 --> 00:51:51.960
God is all this is just a stone, we know how to manage.

00:51:52.118 --> 00:51:54.427
it's all Swayambhu and all this nonsense.

00:51:54.631 --> 00:51:57.220
So they, they are least afraid of God.

00:51:57.388 --> 00:51:59.935
They do all kinds of things, without being afraid of God

00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.754
because they think there is no God really, it's just a joke

00:52:03.078 --> 00:52:04.414
so one thing cancel.

00:52:05.314 --> 00:52:07.663
Second thing is that

00:52:07.688 --> 00:52:11.203
the people who are sort of educated out of them,

00:52:11.250 --> 00:52:13.960
they think it's dishonest to say, there is God

00:52:13.985 --> 00:52:15.973
because there is no God, better to say there is no God.

00:52:16.161 --> 00:52:18.935
Out of them have come out these Samajwadi's, you see,

00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.400
socialist like Kirloskar,

00:52:20.926 --> 00:52:22.375
Gorey all these people.

00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.763
They openly say there's no God

00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:29.960
openly.

00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.360
So that is how it is.

00:52:38.266 --> 00:52:40.410
Now,we have to understand that

00:52:40.528 --> 00:52:42.960
we are real Brahmins

00:52:43.559 --> 00:52:45.960
no doubt, assume your powers.

00:52:46.819 --> 00:52:50.512
know that you are real brahmins, you are the Brahmins.

00:52:50.931 --> 00:52:52.504
None of these are brahmin

00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.684
because you know the Brahm, this is the Brahm tattwa,

00:52:54.709 --> 00:52:56.610
you know how to handle it, you know the vibration.

00:52:56.656 --> 00:52:57.960
Chaitanya is the Brahm.

00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:06.960
Of course you are different than them

00:53:07.584 --> 00:53:10.671
so they are not allowed to enter into any temple, as you are.

00:53:10.866 --> 00:53:13.485
One day will come when that will happen you'll see that.

00:53:13.548 --> 00:53:16.519
we have to change the whole system upside down,

00:53:16.636 --> 00:53:17.960
otherwise things won't work out.

00:53:19.126 --> 00:53:20.916
The whole system has to be changed

00:53:22.671 --> 00:53:26.531
but still, because this a yoga bhumi

00:53:26.966 --> 00:53:29.945
still, you can find the truth in this Motherearth.

00:53:30.546 --> 00:53:32.550
Saints and saints have born.

00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:34.935
they have talked about all these things,

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:38.602
so there is no chance of abusing anything much,

00:53:38.923 --> 00:53:41.162
cannot go to Mooladhara of that action

00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:43.519
that we understand.

00:53:44.173 --> 00:53:46.972
At least that wisdom we have we, we won't go that side

00:53:47.259 --> 00:53:48.704
that's the worst of all.

00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:56.960
Mother: For washing My feet, you do this,
remove it  from underneath

00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:01.960
Now call Madras yogies to wash the feet,

00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.360
Keep water here and recite Ganesha Stotra.

00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.960
Now do this, the one who in going to recite Mantras,

00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:09.960
will not do that thing,

00:54:09.960 --> 00:54:11.960
You come here, you understand everything.

00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:15.960
You recite the Mantra, you recite the Mantra
and you can recite there

00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:17.960
You bring the water.

00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.320
You are catching badly,

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:27.200
You can get somebody else.

00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:29.960
Dani you come here.

00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:34.040
All are from Madras or else where?

00:54:50.160 --> 00:54:51.200
Yes, you come here.

00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.120
You just move there.

00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.080
feeling of a very strong catch,feeling hot vibrations? You see!

00:54:58.080 --> 00:54:59.160
It's very hot,

00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:01.960
Pick up

00:55:08.320 --> 00:55:09.960
God bless you! No

00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:11.160
Pour the water.

00:55:14.240 --> 00:55:15.400
Now recite.

00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:18.200
Now this is what it is washing My feet

00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.080
with the Ganesha stotram

00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:24.960
start this.

00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:35.080
Those who have not washed My feet raise their hands

00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:37.960
Yogis: Those who have not washed Mother's feet, those

00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:39.960
who have not washed previously

00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:18.960
Two persons

00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:21.960
You are still moving with  the ladle [Marathi]

00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.080

00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:42.960
