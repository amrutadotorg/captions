WEBVTT

00:02.720 --> 00:04.520
Please be seated.

01:17.240 --> 01:22.200
Madras is known for perfect rituals about puja

01:23.320 --> 01:26.960
and that is how

01:28.040 --> 01:31.960
in the growth of our awareness

01:33.880 --> 01:39.080
even towards God and towards the rituals

01:40.640 --> 01:43.400
we have moved from reality.

01:45.160 --> 01:47.960
As they say the tree of awareness grows downwards

01:49.111 --> 01:49.960
so in the West

01:50.354 --> 01:51.960
it grew towards materialism,

01:53.096 --> 01:54.200
grew towards

01:56.381 --> 01:58.311
something that was filthy

01:59.499 --> 02:00.819
went down and down.

02:02.240 --> 02:06.440
But as Shri Krishna has said the roots are in your head

02:08.822 --> 02:10.455
But in the Hindu religion

02:12.440 --> 02:13.639
it didn't go that bad.

02:13.732 --> 02:15.537
In other religions it did

02:15.844 --> 02:17.960
but not in Hindu religion that bad.

02:19.960 --> 02:22.960
What happened in the Hindu religion that it went

02:24.112 --> 02:26.807
to the left or to the right.

02:28.324 --> 02:29.960
So when it went to the right

02:31.161 --> 02:32.465
it went towards

02:33.145 --> 02:37.960
the elements of worshipping of elements.

02:42.080 --> 02:44.565
That's how they started Vedas.

02:44.955 --> 02:48.377
Vedas are like Stuties and Smrities are made

02:49.218 --> 02:50.960
to master the elements,

02:54.520 --> 02:55.960
to master the elements.

02:57.120 --> 02:58.480
How do you master the elements?

02:58.560 --> 03:00.560
You can ask the breeze to blow in

03:00.720 --> 03:02.720
now you need some breeze, all right have it.

03:03.720 --> 03:06.000
you can do the

03:06.880 --> 03:11.520
Sun miracles of every kind.

03:12.000 --> 03:14.080
You can get the rain if you want

03:14.280 --> 03:17.440
all these things could have been done

03:20.160 --> 03:22.080
through the Vedas.

03:22.320 --> 03:24.840
But the first and forth thing fore

03:25.320 --> 03:28.320
foremost thing in the Vedas, is that

03:28.560 --> 03:31.560
it should be Vida, Vida is the word,

03:31.720 --> 03:33.480
Vida is the main word.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.040
Now vida means bodha

03:36.600 --> 03:40.040
Bodh means the experience

03:40.440 --> 03:43.880
of the central nervous system.

03:44.720 --> 03:48.000
It doesn't mean that I give you a big lecture

03:48.600 --> 03:50.280
or you read some books,

03:50.480 --> 03:53.480
you read Vedas by heart, no.

03:53.840 --> 03:58.400
It was meaning that you first become the vidas.

03:58.840 --> 04:02.480
vidvanaas, vid, vid means, the bodhas

04:02.640 --> 04:06.480
That means the awareness must achieve it's fourth dimension

04:06.960 --> 04:10.800
and should, you should become

04:11.080 --> 04:14.760
a  person with that fourth dimension,

04:15.480 --> 04:19.480
achieving the sensation

04:19.680 --> 04:23.400
of the All-Pervading  power

04:23.920 --> 04:27.200
on your central nervous system.

04:27.560 --> 04:31.240
This was what Vedas were.

04:31.360 --> 04:35.280
But when you have achieved it and then you read the Vedas

04:35.480 --> 04:40.960
then you can have power on all the elements.

04:42.080 --> 04:47.800
So then now, if you read stuties and smrities, it has a meaning.

04:48.320 --> 04:53.240
But to achieve that state first of all, is important.

04:53.600 --> 04:57.360
That's why in sahaja yoga we don't deal with Vedas just now.

04:57.960 --> 05:00.280
We have to achieve that state,

05:00.440 --> 05:05.680
when by reading those Vedas or by saying those mantras

05:06.240 --> 05:11.960
we can achieve that state in which automatically,

05:12.200 --> 05:19.160
spontaneously you can have power on all the elements.

05:19.400 --> 05:22.160
But not with desires, it just works out spontaneously,

05:22.280 --> 05:25.800
is a state, is a state of a personality.

05:26.360 --> 05:30.960
So, this is how it started.

05:31.480 --> 05:35.000
Now, even in the Vedas

05:35.200 --> 05:39.720
they wanted to go to the essence of everything.

05:40.040 --> 05:42.560
It was not nirakara they talked of

05:42.760 --> 05:46.160
but the essence of every chakras.

05:46.360 --> 05:49.760
To say that they just talked of nirakara

05:49.960 --> 05:55.440
is the way, you don't understand at all Veda.

05:55.760 --> 05:59.520
They didn't talk of the formless

05:59.880 --> 06:05.840
they talked of the all pervading Power, which is formless.

06:06.320 --> 06:10.760
They talked about that part which is the essence of chakras

06:11.600 --> 06:15.040
but they didn't want to talk about the Deities.

06:15.440 --> 06:18.400
Because when you talk about the Deities

06:18.600 --> 06:20.640
then people get stuck with it.

06:20.800 --> 06:24.320
Like as I always say that when you talk about the flowers

06:24.760 --> 06:28.960
people get stuck to it and they don't seek the

06:29.760 --> 06:33.880
nectar, they don't seek the honey.

06:34.080 --> 06:37.360
Now, the second part is, if you talk about the honey

06:38.280 --> 06:41.640
also you just talk about the honey.

06:42.200 --> 06:44.400
It's talk and talk.

06:44.600 --> 06:50.680
So you have to become a madhukar, you have to become the bee,

06:51.120 --> 06:52.760
to get to that honey.

06:52.960 --> 06:54.480
That's the main point.

06:54.840 --> 07:00.560
Unless and until you become the bee you cannot get to the honey

07:00.760 --> 07:04.360
whether you talk about honey or about flowers.

07:04.560 --> 07:08.280
So Vedas also became another talk

07:08.760 --> 07:12.840
and after that the horrible thing happened was the Arya Samaj.

07:12.920 --> 07:14.280
That's the worst of all.

07:14.440 --> 07:17.040
I mean if you meet any Arya Samaji you feel like jumping in the sea,

07:17.160 --> 07:20.120
I mean to get rid of him, it's horrible.

07:20.360 --> 07:22.240
He talks, talks, talks,talks through his hat,

07:22.400 --> 07:27.200
he doesn't know what he's talking and what he is meaning.

07:27.880 --> 07:32.960
So this Arya Samaj business came out of the same Veda

07:33.240 --> 07:35.760
which is a one side, the right side.

07:35.960 --> 07:38.760
So we got stuck on to the right side;

07:38.960 --> 07:41.040
the awareness, the tree of awareness got stuck,

07:41.240 --> 07:44.920
the leaves caught on to the right side.

07:45.360 --> 07:48.754
Like in the West they have got it in the grounds ,

07:49.027 --> 07:50.960
absolutely into the filth.

07:51.447 --> 07:53.840
the dirt of Mooladhara, beyond Mooladhara.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.326
But we too have lost ourselves

07:58.240 --> 07:59.323
on to the right side

08:00.523 --> 08:03.960
and doing all supra conscious nonsense at the time of

08:07.080 --> 08:07.960
Changdev

08:09.636 --> 08:13.690
that was when Shri Gyaneshwara was there.

08:14.887 --> 08:16.960
he was a supra conscious mind person

08:18.360 --> 08:21.960
and he tried to show some supra conscious miracles.

08:23.840 --> 08:27.752
to Shri Gyaneshwara.

08:28.797 --> 08:33.306
Gyaneshwara and his brothers and sisters were sitting on a wall

08:35.355 --> 08:37.413
and suddenly the whole wall lifted up

08:37.440 --> 08:39.768
and took them from one place to another

08:41.026 --> 08:42.415
and this fellow was surprised

08:42.440 --> 08:46.415
how on material things how they are working out.

08:46.440 --> 08:49.549
because they became first of all

08:50.370 --> 08:52.280
realized souls of a very high level.

08:53.648 --> 08:55.804
Gyaneshwara was an incarnation

08:56.960 --> 09:00.960
and then they had also their mastery

09:00.960 --> 09:02.360
over all the five elements.

09:03.329 --> 09:05.657
But that is first you go urdhwagami

09:06.204 --> 09:08.000
first you achieve your realization,

09:08.470 --> 09:11.960
you achieve your state of your realization

09:13.120 --> 09:15.400
and then you come down

09:16.200 --> 09:18.457
in a way that you go to the right

09:18.723 --> 09:19.960
and you can go to the left.

09:20.338 --> 09:22.604
But first your doings must be built.

09:23.320 --> 09:24.440
This was the state.

09:24.960 --> 09:26.960
That's how in our Hindu religion

09:27.360 --> 09:28.960
we got stuck upon the right side

09:29.320 --> 09:31.960
say mantras, stuties and you are not realized soul,

09:31.985 --> 09:33.120
you are not even vidas.

09:36.160 --> 09:38.960
Without realization it's like a charpat panjari,

09:39.024 --> 09:41.960
as they call it, it's just talking,talking, talking, talking.

09:43.440 --> 09:44.920
so that is no use.

09:45.960 --> 09:48.960
The second thing was, we got stuck on the left

09:49.656 --> 09:52.920
in the sense, where they talked of the Deities

09:53.200 --> 09:56.400
we started worshipping Deities,

09:58.249 --> 09:59.960
who would worship the Deities.

10:00.280 --> 10:01.741
you have no right to worship,

10:01.766 --> 10:03.397
you have no passage to them,

10:03.616 --> 10:05.123
you have no connection with them.

10:05.287 --> 10:06.920
How are you worshipping them?

10:07.360 --> 10:09.236
In the air somewhere, they're worshipping,

10:09.376 --> 10:12.175
like going to Vitthal mandir

10:12.948 --> 10:14.400
in Maharashtra.

10:15.280 --> 10:16.392
You see it was alright

10:17.960 --> 10:20.374
for Tukarama to worship

10:21.642 --> 10:23.243
because they were all realized souls.

10:23.837 --> 10:25.960
But these stupid people nowadays,

10:27.440 --> 10:30.960
from the villages, they take some Tabacco in the mouth

10:32.314 --> 10:34.345
and go on worshipping God

10:35.994 --> 10:37.960
in the sense that they go on saying alright

10:37.960 --> 10:40.480
Vitthal, Vitthal, Vitthal,  all like mad going

10:41.280 --> 10:42.960
till they break their necks and

10:43.200 --> 10:45.960
when they go there also these,the priests there

10:46.681 --> 10:49.360
break their heads actually, just like coconuts.

10:49.978 --> 10:52.892
And I have met many who have lost their heads completely.

10:52.960 --> 10:54.960
they said we got it through Vitthal.Imagine.

10:57.927 --> 11:00.224
Vitthala gave this, Imagine!

11:00.451 --> 11:01.841
This is the situation.

11:02.976 --> 11:06.280
So we have to realize that we also in our seeking,

11:07.591 --> 11:09.434
we got stuck on to the left hand side.

11:09.755 --> 11:11.960
But much worse in Madras I've seen a horrid scenes

11:12.960 --> 11:14.960
like I saw

11:15.679 --> 11:17.960
ladies going round the temple

11:18.101 --> 11:19.960
somebody pouring water

11:21.200 --> 11:23.286
was so shocked

11:23.621 --> 11:26.880
at the cruelty of this kind of a thing. I sat down

11:27.400 --> 11:29.718
was wondering, who told them this nonsense?

11:30.400 --> 11:31.456
God knows?

11:32.364 --> 11:34.960
Then the ritualism was taken over,

11:35.652 --> 11:37.769
which was not real rituals because

11:37.960 --> 11:39.960
you have not connected by the Brahmins

11:41.280 --> 11:42.429
all over India.

11:43.882 --> 11:46.920
Now the Brahmins are the ones, who have known the Brahma.

11:47.707 --> 11:50.261
You are Brahmins because you know the Brahma.

11:51.040 --> 11:52.960
But Brahmins were not

11:53.581 --> 11:55.347
to be considered as Brahmins

11:56.064 --> 11:58.175
because they are born in a Brahmin family.

12:00.108 --> 12:01.960
It was not according to your birth

12:02.047 --> 12:03.960
but according to your karmas,  is a fact

12:04.581 --> 12:06.000
I'll give you an example.

12:08.477 --> 12:11.456
Like, once there was a problem,

12:11.481 --> 12:14.563
Shankaracharya, so called,

12:15.264 --> 12:17.266
raised a Parliament question, you see,

12:18.080 --> 12:18.960
that

12:24.960 --> 12:26.960
it is written in the Gita that

12:27.218 --> 12:29.460
you get your birth

12:29.515 --> 12:31.397
prenatal natal or post-natal stuff.

12:31.826 --> 12:33.406
In the post-natal condition

12:33.440 --> 12:37.880
whatever you are born that is your caste.

12:38.312 --> 12:39.960
and so, the Brahmins

12:40.571 --> 12:42.830
are the only ones allowed in the temples

12:42.960 --> 12:45.597
and so as we are born Brahmins we are the ones

12:45.644 --> 12:46.960
allowed in the temples.

12:48.960 --> 12:51.839
So that time a person came to ask Me,

12:51.960 --> 12:52.960
how to answer this.

12:54.440 --> 12:55.538
I said,"very simple".

12:55.850 --> 12:57.240
You ask them who wrote Gita?

12:58.400 --> 13:00.542
Vyasa. Who was Vyasa?

13:00.714 --> 13:04.960
Illegitimate child of a  fisher woman.

13:11.648 --> 13:13.648
Now, how can he say such a thing?

13:14.351 --> 13:15.922
Because he was a Brahmin.

13:16.244 --> 13:18.960
It's true, only the Brahmins must be allowed in the temple.

13:19.320 --> 13:21.464
But who are the Brahmins is the basic problem.

13:23.299 --> 13:26.843
If you are born as a Brahmin, you are not a Brahmin according to

13:27.125 --> 13:28.960
Hindu religion. Should not be.

13:30.380 --> 13:31.857
You have to know the Brahma.

13:32.044 --> 13:33.528
What about Valmiki?

13:33.724 --> 13:35.325
He was another fisherman,

13:36.511 --> 13:37.960
who became a daaku.

13:38.744 --> 13:40.126
He was a dacoit

13:40.440 --> 13:45.630
and this dacoit was really a horrible man.

13:46.044 --> 13:48.892
But was corrected by Narada, as you know the whole story.

13:49.720 --> 13:51.127
So, he is the Valmiki.

13:51.830 --> 13:54.480
Now, how does Valmiki becomes a Brahmin?

13:58.315 --> 13:59.643
So, how is he

14:00.940 --> 14:04.960
the one who wrote Ramayana, who was a dacoit

14:07.456 --> 14:09.698
and born of such a low caste.

14:15.120 --> 14:16.960
But they will not allow Vaidas

14:17.306 --> 14:19.173
and Kabir Das to enter the temples,

14:19.360 --> 14:21.515
but these horrible, so called brahmins

14:21.859 --> 14:25.120
are sitting there eating the money,that is given to God.

14:26.111 --> 14:28.880
So it is necessary for Indian sahaja yogies

14:29.160 --> 14:31.960
to understand how we have failed

14:32.000 --> 14:33.080
we must know our defects,

14:33.794 --> 14:37.747
why we have failed in our pursuit of God?

14:39.408 --> 14:41.218
Why there are so many temples?

14:41.321 --> 14:42.588
See, many people ask Me

14:42.745 --> 14:45.104
Mother, You say, it's a yoga bhumi,

14:45.400 --> 14:47.920
it is this that then, why are you so poor?

14:49.847 --> 14:51.960
Why such a problem in your country?

14:52.960 --> 14:57.081
The reason is  we're not yogis

14:57.237 --> 14:59.300
Yogakshema vahamamyam

14:59.401 --> 15:01.960
if you get the yoga, then He gives you kshema.

15:02.859 --> 15:04.960
First you get the yoga then the kshema,

15:05.289 --> 15:07.760
without the yoga, there is no kshema.

15:08.473 --> 15:10.880
And without the yoga, you are not the Brahmin.

15:11.379 --> 15:12.960
That's as  simple as that.

15:14.439 --> 15:16.681
Even to interpret Shri Krishna

15:17.486 --> 15:18.960
you have to be a realized soul.

15:20.265 --> 15:22.453
See what He says, three things He has said,

15:23.219 --> 15:24.579
Bhakti yoga He says,

15:24.892 --> 15:26.783
"Patram, pushpam, phalam, toyam"

15:27.440 --> 15:29.293
all these things, I

15:30.400 --> 15:31.519
give to you.

15:33.911 --> 15:36.960
I take from you, I receive.

15:38.706 --> 15:40.175
When it comes to giving,

15:40.200 --> 15:41.960
He says, the word ananya bhakti,

15:41.985 --> 15:44.486
ananya; means when there not the other.

15:45.107 --> 15:47.255
When this happens, He is the diplomat.

15:47.624 --> 15:49.898
I want to tell you frankly on your face.

15:51.078 --> 15:52.960
Ananya means when you are a yogi,

15:54.042 --> 15:55.628
when there is not the other.

15:58.480 --> 16:00.960
Then He comes to second point.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.561
Gyana He said the first thing.Gyana means bodh

16:05.912 --> 16:07.678
bodh marg that is sahaja yoga.

16:10.179 --> 16:11.960
Then about karma, right side

16:12.538 --> 16:13.920
what does He say?

16:14.093 --> 16:16.857
You do all your work and put it at My lotus feet.

16:17.360 --> 16:19.880
"Karmanye va dhi karastey phaleshu ma kadachin."

16:20.500 --> 16:22.070
Impossible situation.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.640
See this is diplomacy

16:24.093 --> 16:26.960
Put absurd conditions, which look sensible,

16:27.086 --> 16:27.960
but are absurd,

16:28.149 --> 16:29.836
so you go on rubbing with that.

16:30.440 --> 16:31.930
There are many who tell Me,Mother,

16:31.960 --> 16:34.474
we do, all our jobs and put at the Lotus Feet of God.

16:34.912 --> 16:36.960
I said, "Really, how do you know that?"

16:38.334 --> 16:41.357
Because unless and until you are a realized soul

16:41.584 --> 16:43.055
you feel you are doing it

16:43.080 --> 16:43.960
but once you're realized soul

16:43.985 --> 16:45.720
you said, 'It's going, it's coming,

16:45.951 --> 16:47.240
it's happening, not happening,

16:52.200 --> 16:53.120
see the point.

16:54.418 --> 16:56.942
Now, because of this

16:58.320 --> 17:01.960
what happens that

17:03.932 --> 17:05.635
people get into a bhrama,

17:05.697 --> 17:07.111
into an illusion

17:07.658 --> 17:09.080
that we are doing all God's work

17:09.693 --> 17:11.960
and putting at His feet, you are not.

17:12.646 --> 17:13.960
You are not a realized soul

17:14.801 --> 17:16.415
you have to become a third person

17:16.440 --> 17:17.960
you have to say, I am giving it.

17:18.960 --> 17:21.385
No, it's going, it's coming

17:22.232 --> 17:23.240
I goes away.

17:24.137 --> 17:26.559
Doesn't work out, it works out.

17:26.964 --> 17:28.502
You never say, 'Mother,

17:28.527 --> 17:29.960
I can't work out sahaja yoga.

17:29.985 --> 17:31.299
I've not heard anybody saying that.

17:31.324 --> 17:32.689
They say, Mother,  doesn't work out,

17:32.996 --> 17:34.584
it works out,  it's working.'

17:34.779 --> 17:37.475
We start just talking about it all the time,

17:37.615 --> 17:40.230
as soon as we become a realized soul.

17:42.964 --> 17:45.371
There was a lady, who came with Me to America

17:46.128 --> 17:49.333
and she said, Mother, please give realization to my son.

17:49.440 --> 17:51.685
He's come all the way from Honolulu, this that.

17:52.372 --> 17:53.537
I said, "You give him."

17:54.080 --> 17:55.122
I can't.

17:55.400 --> 17:56.740
I said then, "How can I?"

17:57.381 --> 17:59.412
Then you give him a certificate, he is a realized soul.

17:59.437 --> 18:02.119
How can I, it's false? I said that's what it is.

18:03.960 --> 18:05.077
It has to happen.

18:05.288 --> 18:06.960
You cannot give a false certificate

18:07.790 --> 18:10.032
that you are a realized soul, it has to happen.

18:12.368 --> 18:14.540
And that is what sahaja yoga is

18:14.595 --> 18:16.080
absolutely a shuddh vidya (pure knowledge)

18:16.960 --> 18:17.960
and a shuddh thing

18:18.671 --> 18:21.840
that in that you have to get realization

18:21.865 --> 18:23.960
and establish yourself.

18:25.350 --> 18:26.960
So by going to the left-side

18:27.215 --> 18:28.849
we got stuck up into the

18:29.193 --> 18:32.185
collective subconscious.This side the collective supra conscious

18:32.302 --> 18:35.240
that side the collective subconscious.

18:35.304 --> 18:37.960
The people who are now in the West have

18:38.400 --> 18:40.530
discovered all about the matter and all that

18:41.080 --> 18:44.531
has come out of this kind of a venture on the right hand side

18:45.374 --> 18:48.742
because God wanted them to know that know the matter

18:48.960 --> 18:52.674
that's all, for their convenience, for their comfort,

18:53.240 --> 18:54.960
for giving them more time,

18:55.280 --> 18:56.400
so that they come to God.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.741
But Science moved in a one linear way

19:00.803 --> 19:04.194
and has produced atom bombs and everything like rakshasas

19:04.374 --> 19:06.922
and now they are waiting for the rakshasas

19:06.960 --> 19:08.750
to drop down upon themselves.

19:09.044 --> 19:10.283
On the left-hand side

19:10.760 --> 19:13.056
now we, now, this is India

19:13.174 --> 19:14.713
left hand side is India.

19:16.241 --> 19:18.491
We got stuck, we are stucky people.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.920
You see, they lost their roots,

19:22.200 --> 19:23.800
you can be fool them like anything in

19:23.825 --> 19:25.482
as far as religion is concerned.

19:26.372 --> 19:28.080
They have no roots at all also

19:29.288 --> 19:32.880
because they have gone down so much

19:33.378 --> 19:35.960
or there, their roots are lost, they have no roots.

19:36.087 --> 19:38.364
They're dangling, you can put them into left or right

19:38.637 --> 19:41.960
You know, witchcraft is so much common in America.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.175
You can put them into witchcraft,

19:44.208 --> 19:46.395
you can put it into any craft you want to

19:46.629 --> 19:47.870
you can manage them.

19:47.895 --> 19:50.468
or they can go to the right side, they can go to the left side

19:50.493 --> 19:51.960
you can create Hitlers out of them,

19:51.985 --> 19:53.771
you can created anything what you want

19:53.796 --> 19:55.960
because they have become just like bananas,

19:56.080 --> 19:57.051
they have no roots.

20:00.160 --> 20:01.960
So one side, we got stuck with this

20:02.461 --> 20:05.792
too much argumentation, too much of discussion,

20:05.824 --> 20:09.443
too much of what you call Philosophy

20:09.693 --> 20:13.396
this that, the intellectuals, so called, vidvanas

20:13.774 --> 20:17.080
in the Hindu Philosophy, are stupid people.

20:18.433 --> 20:20.558
Because they have not got their realization

20:21.658 --> 20:25.353
and even to such an extent, now they are saying that

20:26.540 --> 20:29.540
Adishankaracharya did not write,

20:29.680 --> 20:34.090
Adishankaracharya did not write the

20:35.120 --> 20:36.629
Saundarya Lahiri.

20:37.549 --> 20:38.751
Intellectuals, you know,

20:39.462 --> 20:41.960
they are the great grandfathers of Adi Shankaracharya

20:42.160 --> 20:43.960
so they're saying he did not write.

20:44.659 --> 20:48.320
Because, how can a Vivek Chudanami, the one he wrote, you see,

20:48.632 --> 20:51.492
after that whole thing such a treatise of

20:51.678 --> 20:54.063
all Philosophy, how could he write

20:54.188 --> 20:56.960
that you must serve the Mother,

20:57.584 --> 20:58.822
how can that be?

21:01.160 --> 21:02.960
In puja you should sit in right manner.

21:03.357 --> 21:06.200
Don't do this, you attention should be towards Me.

21:09.530 --> 21:13.960
Alright, so as a result of that what happened that we

21:15.280 --> 21:20.216
got lost into intellectual understanding of our

21:21.732 --> 21:24.960
Philosophy and for that

21:27.675 --> 21:29.960
As Kabir Das has put it

21:30.011 --> 21:31.960
"'Padhi, padhi pundit moorakh bhaiye."

21:31.985 --> 21:33.960
So they have become stupid fools right side.

21:35.013 --> 21:38.404
Left side people got stuck into these rituals

21:39.077 --> 21:41.069
so these Brahmins became very powerful

21:41.124 --> 21:44.628
so called Brahmins. So much so that in Nasik

21:45.019 --> 21:48.960
the Brahmins sent Me word saying that the

21:49.459 --> 21:51.186
because You have come from abroad

21:51.280 --> 21:53.428
you have to come for your prayaschit to us.

21:53.453 --> 21:55.557
Even Gandhiji had to do the prayashchit.

21:55.682 --> 21:58.854
I said, "One day you will have to do prayashchit."

21:59.523 --> 22:00.960
Such arrogance

22:01.986 --> 22:04.175
and such horrid things they're doing.

22:05.511 --> 22:07.082
And Kashi Vishweshwara

22:07.960 --> 22:10.831
they have got Romans, you see, Roman soldiers.

22:12.159 --> 22:14.570
Actually they came to Maharashtra

22:14.796 --> 22:16.585
on the Konkan side

22:17.148 --> 22:20.006
maybe in Goa or some place, Panaji maybe,

22:20.529 --> 22:23.960
and from there they went.

22:25.400 --> 22:26.960
Adi Shankaracharya must have thought

22:27.592 --> 22:29.693
that in the beginning they were nice people

22:29.718 --> 22:31.960
He must have given realization one or two person

22:32.960 --> 22:34.314
So he appointed all of them,

22:34.360 --> 22:36.785
these Konkanasthas, They are Konkanash
(One Cast of Brahmins in India)

22:38.307 --> 22:40.151
into all these places

22:40.690 --> 22:42.960
and within two, three generations, two generations,

22:43.240 --> 22:45.744
I think, they came in their true colors as Romans.

22:47.280 --> 22:49.960
And they're just like cobras, you see, like cobras.

22:51.797 --> 22:56.461
And in Kashi Vishweshwara they started using women.

22:58.200 --> 23:01.723
They had a one big slippery board

23:02.445 --> 23:04.179
and the when women went there,

23:04.204 --> 23:06.280
they used to fall down with ornaments, on them

23:06.627 --> 23:08.322
Then they would take out all the ornaments,

23:08.347 --> 23:09.960
sell these women as prostitutes.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.160
That's why in Banaras

23:11.261 --> 23:13.160
you have the maximum number of prostitutes.

23:16.960 --> 23:19.370
These Brahmins the way they behaved

23:19.894 --> 23:24.430
in certain places like, Ranchordas's temple,

23:25.336 --> 23:30.077
all the Nath Dwara

23:31.819 --> 23:35.388
that was called as haveli, it was a very big case

23:36.427 --> 23:38.653
and the main man there, the haveli man,

23:38.724 --> 23:39.960
the one who, chief priest,

23:40.820 --> 23:42.508
was supposed to used

23:42.960 --> 23:44.631
the brides on the first night.

23:45.100 --> 23:48.080
I know of so many great women, who have been used by him.

23:50.429 --> 23:53.715
All this nonsense started growing in this country like that.

23:55.066 --> 23:57.512
So many things, I mean there is no end to it

23:58.685 --> 24:00.960
even in Vindhya, Vindhiya Vasini, they did it.

24:01.746 --> 24:03.754
Then out of these at the extreme end,

24:03.779 --> 24:05.320
started coming the tantrism

24:06.605 --> 24:09.230
and the tantrikas discovered a thing

24:09.617 --> 24:12.960
that if you can displease the Goddess in any place

24:13.437 --> 24:15.484
then that place becomes a vacuum

24:15.509 --> 24:16.883
because She's so much there.

24:16.938 --> 24:19.580
Once She goes away, the vacuum is created,

24:19.689 --> 24:22.816
then use that vacuum for getting all the bhoots there

24:23.191 --> 24:24.472
like Kamakhya Devi.

24:24.659 --> 24:27.272
There are twenty-eight places where the goddess's

24:27.304 --> 24:29.983
body fell down, when you know the Sati,

24:30.160 --> 24:31.960
Sati's body fell,

24:32.026 --> 24:34.811
She was carried from Daksha, the father

24:34.901 --> 24:38.215
by Shiva it fell down on twenty-eight places

24:38.400 --> 24:40.978
and when it fell down on twenty-eight places

24:41.064 --> 24:44.403
There form a temple, came out of the mother Earth.

24:45.083 --> 24:46.920
One of them is Kamakhya Devi

24:47.059 --> 24:51.070
that is, I think, in Assam or Bihar some border there.

24:51.960 --> 24:56.149
All these temples were used for doing negative things

24:56.500 --> 24:58.529
because they did vyabhichara all that

24:58.572 --> 25:00.052
in the presence of the goddess,

25:00.077 --> 25:01.960
as a result of the goddess, you see,

25:02.259 --> 25:04.724
the goddess got angry, She went away from there.

25:04.749 --> 25:06.895
Because, you know, supposing you put the filth here,

25:06.920 --> 25:08.416
I won't sit here, will I?

25:10.022 --> 25:12.047
That's how and then they used that part

25:12.325 --> 25:14.192
for mesmerizing and this and that

25:14.340 --> 25:16.286
and that's how the tantrism started.

25:16.880 --> 25:20.060
As a result of this tantrism just after

25:21.294 --> 25:22.960
Adi Shankaracharya's death

25:23.601 --> 25:25.562
the tantrikas just came out

25:25.687 --> 25:27.960
just like snakes coming out of the grass.

25:28.144 --> 25:31.237
And they spread the tantrism right from Konark

25:31.663 --> 25:33.714
all through on that whole

25:34.277 --> 25:36.605
I should say the whole patta of it, the whole

25:36.960 --> 25:40.960
line from there up to Surat, up to down like that

25:42.118 --> 25:43.960
the whole of it, they covered.

25:44.053 --> 25:46.193
They could not cross into Maharashtra, thank God

25:46.218 --> 25:49.267
because Maharashtra is, you have to come up and then go

25:49.463 --> 25:51.564
into the plateau so they didn't come.

25:51.809 --> 25:55.167
But the whole thing they covered, above the river Narmada,

25:55.964 --> 25:57.261
above the river Tapi

25:57.960 --> 26:00.239
they covered all that area,  Madhya Pradesh,

26:00.308 --> 26:02.512
you see, all the Raja, Maharajas all of them

26:02.725 --> 26:03.521
were involved.

26:04.039 --> 26:06.960
And what they did was to play a trick with the Raja, Maharaja

26:07.055 --> 26:10.380
Just  because they had Jain, Jain people.

26:11.081 --> 26:17.614
as what you call ministers or mantris.

26:17.911 --> 26:19.419
And the mantris said

26:19.614 --> 26:21.364
that we want to build temples.

26:22.457 --> 26:25.554
So these Rajas, Maharajas were all under these tantrikas.

26:26.388 --> 26:28.247
So the Raja, Maharajas said, all right.

26:28.272 --> 26:30.982
if you can put these erotics outside, I am willing to do.

26:32.665 --> 26:35.055
So they said but why do you want to put the erotics.

26:35.080 --> 26:37.298
They were very clever people these mantricas.

26:37.323 --> 26:38.657
so they said, No.

26:38.805 --> 26:40.960
You can put these things outside

26:41.074 --> 26:42.902
because that is life.

26:43.663 --> 26:44.822
we must show the life

26:44.923 --> 26:49.007
and they put in very big, sort what you call the very big

26:50.866 --> 26:52.249
competition.

26:52.491 --> 26:54.429
They put a very big competition

26:54.960 --> 26:59.081
and then that competition they tried to defeat

27:02.280 --> 27:04.960
say sort of one, one organization working here in

27:04.985 --> 27:06.516
in competition with the another

27:06.541 --> 27:07.960
then there should be a defeat

27:08.001 --> 27:09.368
and one is defeated,

27:09.393 --> 27:11.391
that was not given a chance to produce.

27:11.672 --> 27:13.960
So the artist also got involved into it.

27:14.207 --> 27:15.957
But still in the,

27:16.440 --> 27:18.543
I should say in the, Madhya Pradesh

27:18.703 --> 27:21.109
now these places, the artists were still dharmic

27:21.233 --> 27:24.931
because they made the all these erotic figures

27:25.216 --> 27:27.724
with lanky- panky bodies, you see,

27:27.867 --> 27:30.344
and very funny looking bodies

27:30.623 --> 27:31.697
like sick people.

27:32.040 --> 27:34.385
and the Gods and Goddesses are very thick

27:34.410 --> 27:36.120
so you don't see them, I mean, normally

27:36.145 --> 27:37.960
you don't see them where are they hanging.

27:39.244 --> 27:41.319
And the same architecture

27:41.686 --> 27:44.812
because it was in the thing was brought

27:44.960 --> 27:48.460
in your country, in your side also, in Madras.

27:48.765 --> 27:50.132
And in Madras temples

27:50.157 --> 27:52.730
what they did was to put all these erotic outside

27:53.089 --> 27:56.960
and they called this is fertility cult, fertility cult.

27:57.824 --> 28:00.920
And on your temples if you see these small, small figures

28:01.080 --> 28:02.274
they are all those.

28:03.454 --> 28:06.268
So how far this negativity has gone

28:06.320 --> 28:08.774
to spoil say like if you go.

28:08.805 --> 28:11.089
to the temple of, say,

28:12.310 --> 28:15.547
Tirupati, Tirupati where sakshat

28:15.974 --> 28:18.133
it is, it is there outside,

28:18.320 --> 28:20.831
of the temples these Brahmins have put all these things

28:20.960 --> 28:22.960
on the door if you see.

28:23.248 --> 28:25.162
Imagine to be put erotics!

28:25.373 --> 28:27.725
Even in Jaggannath Puri

28:27.836 --> 28:29.735
all over they have put these

28:29.891 --> 28:31.609
and we don't understand.

28:32.510 --> 28:35.960
The Konark temple the whole thing was so horrible

28:36.099 --> 28:39.013
because the architect himself was a tantrik.

28:40.360 --> 28:41.768
There's no temple, nothing.

28:41.974 --> 28:44.691
What he has done he's made all these horrible things

28:44.716 --> 28:47.455
and put them in the shape of a temple, there's no temple.

28:47.480 --> 28:49.158
And he said that on top of this

28:49.184 --> 28:51.659
I want to put one very big magnet

28:51.684 --> 28:53.761
so that all the ships will be attracted.

28:53.786 --> 28:55.300
So the king agreed to that

28:56.387 --> 28:57.640
and he gave lot of money

28:57.665 --> 28:59.960
and that is how the Konark temple was built.

29:01.189 --> 29:03.695
Now the Nepal temple was built

29:03.765 --> 29:05.648
when the artist would not accept this.

29:05.673 --> 29:07.732
They have seen, see this is made out of

29:07.892 --> 29:10.060
kashtha means out of wood

29:10.412 --> 29:13.186
and if the Vishnumaya

29:13.257 --> 29:16.452
falls upon it means the lightning

29:16.609 --> 29:17.960
then it will be all burnt

29:18.585 --> 29:21.039
so best thing is to keep Her attention out.

29:21.402 --> 29:22.935
Why not we make some erotics

29:22.960 --> 29:25.678
so that She doesn't come because She is a virgin.

29:25.913 --> 29:27.694
So, poor artist agreed to it

29:27.719 --> 29:29.126
and they made those.

29:30.110 --> 29:31.960
But when we Indians go to a temple,

29:31.960 --> 29:33.446
we never see this, you see

29:33.471 --> 29:35.015
you must have escaped in your temples

29:35.040 --> 29:36.438
you must not have seen this.

29:36.972 --> 29:39.224
But if you see the foreigners then you will know,

29:39.249 --> 29:41.666
where they are, because they have zoom lenses you see.

29:41.691 --> 29:45.207
They'll climb over. I've seen in, in Nepal

29:45.601 --> 29:48.206
you see they, once I when I went there

29:48.315 --> 29:51.172
so Gregoire, I said, "Gregoire where are the erotics sites.

29:51.197 --> 29:53.980
I don't see anything  where are the erotics?"

29:54.207 --> 29:56.697
So, they said, "Oh! You can't see the erotics?"

29:56.722 --> 29:59.274
I said, "No." He said, "See those Japanese."

29:59.477 --> 30:02.336
The Japanese has had put up, you see, big, big

30:02.484 --> 30:03.960
what you call

30:06.678 --> 30:09.550
Staircase, which is automatic, Yogi: Ladder

30:09.694 --> 30:11.566
Ladders but ladders

30:11.591 --> 30:14.245
of a very see the ...

30:14.400 --> 30:15.507
alertness

30:15.624 --> 30:18.609
the ladders but not this like escalator

30:18.834 --> 30:21.392
see, they were like escalators, huge big things.

30:21.748 --> 30:23.657
They brought all these from Japan

30:23.829 --> 30:25.011
and put it up

30:25.168 --> 30:26.449
and took the photograph.

30:26.678 --> 30:28.055
You see, they were taking photographs.

30:28.080 --> 30:30.562
Then I saw all the machinery going on What's that?

30:30.703 --> 30:33.438
They said and zoom lenses, you see, big, big lenses.

30:33.951 --> 30:34.930
Nonsense.

30:35.225 --> 30:37.755
Big. I mean they brought all the machinery all the way.

30:42.160 --> 30:43.097
This is what happens.

30:43.355 --> 30:44.960
Then we had other religions

30:45.160 --> 30:47.960
which tried to, sort of, neutralize it like Jainism

30:48.592 --> 30:50.407
that went into another nonsense.

30:50.616 --> 30:52.376
Jainism is another nonsense

30:52.792 --> 30:55.905
because, you see, at the time of Shri Krishna, Neminath

30:55.944 --> 30:57.792
is the one, who opposed,

30:57.916 --> 30:58.971
Neminath opposed,

31:01.780 --> 31:04.192
Shri Krishna for one thing because He said

31:04.403 --> 31:05.960
He believes in hinsa.

31:06.254 --> 31:08.135
Because in Gita when they say the

31:08.255 --> 31:10.321
Krishna has taught ahinsa I'm surprised.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.388
He taught hinsa.

31:14.172 --> 31:16.805
You know Karna, when his foot was caught up

31:18.200 --> 31:22.952
in the wheel so  Karna

31:24.200 --> 31:26.960
Arjuna, you see, raised his gandiva on him

31:27.154 --> 31:30.408
so,Karna said, "See, you are a veera, I'm a veera."

31:30.565 --> 31:31.960
and how can you kill,

31:31.985 --> 31:34.151
a nishastra (without any arms) veera

31:34.826 --> 31:37.390
See! So then Krishna pointed His finger like this,

31:37.415 --> 31:38.194
and He said,

31:38.601 --> 31:41.960
"When, where was your veerta, where was your bravery

31:42.040 --> 31:44.511
when Draupadi's laaj (chastity) was taken?"

31:45.052 --> 31:46.511
He said, "You kill him, now."

31:47.045 --> 31:49.307
Where did He teach ahinsa I don't know?

31:49.405 --> 31:52.063
Stupidity to think that He teached ahinsa.

31:52.932 --> 31:55.866
He preached that who is so ever is dushta,

31:55.891 --> 31:58.335
who is wrong should be killed by God.

31:59.538 --> 32:02.407
and by the people who are following God.

32:02.453 --> 32:04.750
Like Arjuna, the very beginning of it is

32:04.821 --> 32:05.960
he went into Kaivalya.

32:06.608 --> 32:08.855
He said,"Oh! I don't want to kill anybody,

32:08.880 --> 32:10.920
be there's my guru, there's my brother

32:10.960 --> 32:12.960
there's my sisters this, that."

32:13.366 --> 32:17.392
So Shri Krishna said, "What they are already killed,

32:17.822 --> 32:20.344
In the name of dharma you have to kill them."

32:22.189 --> 32:24.555
And here these stupid these Jains

32:24.891 --> 32:26.960
are looking after the mosquitoes

32:27.784 --> 32:29.701
and looking after the bugs.

32:30.252 --> 32:32.195
They put some bugs in a hut

32:32.234 --> 32:33.960
that's good for the brahmins of course

32:34.078 --> 32:35.931
and give some money to the brahmins

32:36.126 --> 32:38.360
and the bugs have to take all the blood,

32:39.013 --> 32:40.613
eat the blood of the brahmins,

32:40.753 --> 32:43.558
and then they give the money to the brahmin.

32:43.678 --> 32:45.703
But the worst is you know, now,

32:46.647 --> 32:48.632
in Bombay there's a problem because

32:48.995 --> 32:51.821
they take all their filth

32:52.243 --> 32:55.212
not in the bathroom or anything but they put it on some hill

32:55.610 --> 32:58.251
because the kitanoos (germs) must come out,

32:58.751 --> 33:00.706
the germs must come out.

33:02.846 --> 33:04.265
This is Shwetambaras only

33:05.164 --> 33:07.851
but the silliest are the Digambaras

33:08.537 --> 33:10.399
You see, they are the worst of it.

33:10.816 --> 33:13.625
I mean once what happened that

33:17.364 --> 33:19.323
Shri Mahavira was meditating.

33:19.769 --> 33:23.603
While coming out his cloth got cut,

33:23.838 --> 33:25.200
caught up in one kunja.

33:26.256 --> 33:28.989
When his cloth caught up in the kunja

33:29.114 --> 33:31.366
what he did was to

33:34.163 --> 33:36.323
cut it out, because he thought how to get out

33:36.394 --> 33:37.855
so he cut half of his cloth

33:38.097 --> 33:39.960
near a half cloth on his body.

33:40.755 --> 33:43.707
But then Shri Krishna went just to take his pareeksha (test)

33:43.732 --> 33:46.151
and He said, "Now, see, you are a avdhoota,

33:46.320 --> 33:47.840
why do you need a cloth upon yourself,

33:47.865 --> 33:50.087
I'm a nude person you give Me something?”

33:50.251 --> 33:51.632
So he gave Him that.

33:52.186 --> 33:54.858
Just for a minute because he was a king's son,

33:55.035 --> 33:57.048
he didn't have to do anything and he went back

33:57.305 --> 34:00.099
he hid himself and he went back and he wore his dress.

34:00.537 --> 34:03.960
Now, these people are horrible like this Mahabali and all that

34:04.278 --> 34:06.566
making all the details about it it's horrid,

34:06.668 --> 34:10.562
people they're insulting him all the time.

34:13.680 --> 34:15.960
But if you see like William Blake,

34:15.985 --> 34:18.237
he  has made pictures of human beings,

34:18.307 --> 34:19.960
not showing any parts other that

34:20.098 --> 34:21.858
but in a nude way,

34:22.357 --> 34:25.914
when he makes the God or makes anybody Mary or Christ,

34:25.960 --> 34:26.960
covers them.

34:28.147 --> 34:30.060
Same with Michaelangelo.

34:33.701 --> 34:35.070
But I don't understand

34:35.289 --> 34:36.578
these horrible Jains.

34:36.603 --> 34:38.960
They want to show Gods, as nude

34:40.345 --> 34:41.334
and fight for that.

34:41.912 --> 34:43.960
The worse is they're fighting, that's the good part

34:45.576 --> 34:46.850
so much fighting that.

34:48.261 --> 34:50.095
I want to tell you My own experience

34:50.120 --> 34:52.156
but it was horrid one day I'll tell you that

34:52.906 --> 34:54.390
First time when I saw them

34:55.146 --> 34:56.297
they were terrible mess.

34:56.522 --> 34:57.930
Alright, so now

34:58.063 --> 34:59.766
it has reached such a stage

34:59.854 --> 35:01.831
that there is one Parshavnath's

35:02.355 --> 35:05.163
thing was found out somewhere, some old statue,

35:05.749 --> 35:07.960
so there was a fight going on in the,

35:10.040 --> 35:12.684
is the place where Indra was given realization.

35:13.960 --> 35:17.561
This place, his chhidra (pierced) was made here

35:17.586 --> 35:19.323
that's why we call it chidendra

35:19.369 --> 35:20.960
see this chhidra was being here

35:21.332 --> 35:23.965
but actually he's Shuchendra, he was made Shuchi.

35:23.990 --> 35:25.248
This is at the time

35:26.403 --> 35:27.809
of Prahlada

35:28.749 --> 35:30.372
that this Indra,

35:31.403 --> 35:33.428
when the mother was pregnant,

35:33.459 --> 35:35.490
she.. he wanted to help her.

35:35.853 --> 35:37.397
So he brought her

35:37.422 --> 35:39.265
to Shandilya muni's place.

35:39.428 --> 35:43.161
Now this Shandilya muni, Shandilya is My family, My gotra

35:43.440 --> 35:44.960
My father's, Shalivahanas,

35:44.997 --> 35:46.295
gotra is shandily

35:46.545 --> 35:49.263
and he brought that one in Shandilya's ashram.

35:49.727 --> 35:53.091
Now the land we have got in Neera is that ashram

35:54.212 --> 35:55.567
just imagine sahaja

35:55.592 --> 35:56.960
that is the land we have got.

35:57.396 --> 35:59.842
And then now it has come out in the newspapers

35:59.960 --> 36:02.960
for somebody went and did the research after I purchased the land

36:03.892 --> 36:06.696
that this, there was, a

36:08.999 --> 36:12.204
meeting between the Neera river and the river

36:28.499 --> 36:31.526
some King came all the way here and built that.

36:31.678 --> 36:33.375
So imagine, the Shalivahanaas knew

36:33.400 --> 36:34.999
the Neera is going to come in them,

36:35.024 --> 36:36.972
I'm called as Neera in My family,

36:37.293 --> 36:39.702
and on that Neera river, we have got this land.

36:40.343 --> 36:42.694
And this also with a very mysterious thing

36:42.719 --> 36:43.960
because you see, one man

36:44.679 --> 36:46.695
had given this land to the government

36:47.615 --> 36:50.064
see and this land I wanted, I liked it.

36:50.322 --> 36:52.228
He said, 'The government won't release it,

36:52.253 --> 36:53.731
how can You have this land?'

36:53.756 --> 36:54.960
I said I want to have this land only

36:55.014 --> 36:58.134
people didn't understand why I wanted that land, I insisted

36:58.159 --> 37:00.273
Then they said, the government won't release.

37:00.298 --> 37:02.070
But suddenly he got a letter one day

37:02.095 --> 37:04.469
saying that government think they've taken a surplus land

37:04.494 --> 37:05.254
this land is yours.

37:06.402 --> 37:08.656
So he sold it to us and that's how we got it.

37:08.960 --> 37:10.935
Now Prahlada was born there.

37:10.960 --> 37:12.851
He lived there till five years of age

37:12.944 --> 37:14.898
and used to go and play there.

37:15.381 --> 37:18.640
Then Shandilya muni told Indra

37:18.862 --> 37:20.545
that you leave this lady here

37:20.570 --> 37:23.175
because out of her will come out Prahlada.

37:23.200 --> 37:25.960
He brings forth the promised Narsimha avtara.

37:26.413 --> 37:28.667
So you just don't worry and you go South.

37:28.692 --> 37:31.719
and there he came and he got the Shuchindra here

37:32.429 --> 37:33.974
That's how he got realization.

37:34.334 --> 37:35.920
Now this Prahlada

37:37.118 --> 37:39.105
went there you know what happened then

37:39.144 --> 37:41.289
but here about

37:41.374 --> 37:43.764
Peshwai time they tried to build

37:43.886 --> 37:46.197
a temple of Narsimha

37:46.678 --> 37:48.935
and they spent lot of money to fill up the place

37:48.960 --> 37:51.055
and they did it but they could not do much

37:51.080 --> 37:52.684
about the temple it was half done.

37:53.012 --> 37:55.280
Then one fellow about three hundred years back

37:55.366 --> 37:57.935
decided to collect some money to build the temple

37:57.960 --> 37:58.920
and  he built the temple.

37:58.945 --> 38:00.920
In his dream came Prahlada and he told him

38:01.029 --> 38:02.687
that I have already made

38:02.742 --> 38:04.280
the statue of Narsimha

38:04.561 --> 38:06.182
on the river Neera,

38:06.207 --> 38:08.239
you go and find it on the bank you'll find.

38:08.264 --> 38:10.000
He went there and he saw the statue

38:10.914 --> 38:13.448
made out of ordinary sand

38:13.908 --> 38:15.724
for so many years it's there.

38:15.927 --> 38:18.349
He picked it up brought it and it's back there

38:18.521 --> 38:21.790
and it is still there full of vibrations, see the vibrations.

38:23.299 --> 38:24.298
We have seen it.

38:24.498 --> 38:28.040
And in that temple there is on top of the gopuram

38:28.126 --> 38:30.231
you see a little dhara (stream)

38:30.256 --> 38:32.000
of water coming all the time.

38:33.859 --> 38:36.910
We have so many still, so many miracles in this country

38:38.222 --> 38:40.762
but we should go deep into it to find out.

38:40.834 --> 38:43.623
instead of that like stupid fools we are just

38:43.758 --> 38:46.747
running after these so called brahmins.

38:49.130 --> 38:52.583
So the depth and the greatness of

38:53.091 --> 38:57.289
what should you say, the Indian seers

38:57.351 --> 39:00.960
and the rishis and munis was lost like this by these

39:01.115 --> 39:03.657
so called mushroom people.

39:04.220 --> 39:06.313
Now it is for Sahaja Yogies

39:06.721 --> 39:09.880
who have to find out all these things, put them on record

39:09.953 --> 39:11.711
and have to boldly tell them

39:12.197 --> 39:14.195
that we have had enough of you now

39:14.280 --> 39:16.866
let us take over all the temples.

39:18.160 --> 39:19.840
Only the brahmins can enter

39:20.117 --> 39:21.923
you are the only brahmins I see

39:22.093 --> 39:23.477
Where are the brahmins?

39:23.662 --> 39:25.731
Like once in Puna

39:26.360 --> 39:29.960
they had a program arranged for in a

39:30.421 --> 39:33.738
place called Rajwade karyalaya.

39:34.141 --> 39:35.863
This Rajwade is a brahmin

39:36.041 --> 39:39.935
and Rajwade was told later on that no no no

39:39.960 --> 39:41.960
this Mataji is not a brahmin how can you have it here?

39:43.319 --> 39:46.549
So these, the boys never told Me anything they said alright if

39:46.574 --> 39:49.415
you say so we won't have the program

39:49.440 --> 39:51.415
but we'll have to announce in the newspaper that

39:51.440 --> 39:54.335
because She's not a brahmin that's why you're not allowing Her.

39:54.360 --> 39:55.935
He said, "No, no that you can't do.

39:55.960 --> 39:58.643
He said, "Then what are you to say,what is the reason?"

39:58.749 --> 40:01.015
So they got a fright. They said,

40:01.070 --> 40:02.578
"Alright, let us have it."

40:02.679 --> 40:05.201
So when I was having it, I don't know why,I said,

40:05.226 --> 40:08.255
Those who think you are brahmins come here in front of Me."

40:08.280 --> 40:10.960
Four five of them came, started shaking like this way.

40:10.985 --> 40:12.375
I said, "What's the matter?"

40:12.400 --> 40:15.429
They said, "No, we accept You're Shakti, stop it, stop it."

40:15.483 --> 40:17.778
I said, "But I'm Shakti nobody is shaking."

40:17.803 --> 40:20.402
"No, there are people sitting here, they are also shaking."

40:20.544 --> 40:21.949
I said, "Call them."

40:22.226 --> 40:24.227
I said , "Go and ask, who are they?"

40:24.438 --> 40:26.840
They are certified mad from Thane

40:26.960 --> 40:29.187
were sent by the district man.

40:29.695 --> 40:33.608
These brahmins got a fright of their life.

40:33.633 --> 40:35.335
I said, "That's what you are,

40:35.360 --> 40:38.722
you have to go to Thane now, that's the only place for you."

40:38.821 --> 40:41.962
And our Rajwade was sitting on top there,

40:42.071 --> 40:46.491
all sort of caught up

40:46.780 --> 40:48.440
by some sort of an arthritis.

40:49.100 --> 40:51.310
I said, "Rajwade, come down now."

40:51.343 --> 40:53.185
He 'I'm also a brahmin, he says from

40:53.210 --> 40:54.753
I said, "Alright, you come down."

40:54.778 --> 40:57.469
Say, "I can't, I can't even walk." I said, "Get up and walk."

40:57.616 --> 41:00.315
He's the one who just got up and walked.

41:00.521 --> 41:02.681
came down, then he was so good.

41:02.782 --> 41:04.955
He started going on a cycle.

41:05.123 --> 41:06.935
That time he was sixty five.

41:06.960 --> 41:10.811
Everyday he used to go and do work in all the villages, this that

41:10.836 --> 41:13.432
I told him, "Stop it now, you shouldn't over do it also,

41:13.457 --> 41:15.026
it's too much, he won't stop."

41:15.247 --> 41:17.935
And then he started catching from people this, that,

41:17.960 --> 41:19.895
he got sick, again I cured him again,

41:19.920 --> 41:21.681
I cured him, so many times it happened.

41:21.743 --> 41:23.960
But I think ultimately he lost one foot,

41:24.304 --> 41:26.336
one foot he's lost,  little bit.

41:26.696 --> 41:29.674
But that's what it is, so he never listened to Me.

41:29.959 --> 41:31.962
What I'm trying to tell you is this

41:31.987 --> 41:35.220
this is how our great Hindu

41:35.569 --> 41:38.898
or we can say, Hindu word I don't want to use because

41:38.997 --> 41:40.798
it has nothing to do with us.

41:40.918 --> 41:43.149
This word was given to us by Alexander

41:43.765 --> 41:45.852
because he crossed the river Sindhu

41:45.877 --> 41:47.593
he didn't, couldn't say Sindhu, you see,

41:47.618 --> 41:50.087
'sa' he could not say, so he called it Hindu.

41:50.745 --> 41:52.933
Sindhu Hindu, see

41:53.263 --> 41:55.942
And then he came down from there

41:55.967 --> 41:58.317
and that's how we become Indians, you see.

41:58.433 --> 42:01.099
So, they don't know how to pronounce many words, you see,

42:01.124 --> 42:04.911
so that's how they couldn't call Bombay, Mumbai.

42:04.936 --> 42:06.802
so they use to called it Bombay.

42:06.827 --> 42:10.142
See, but Mumbai is a very big word it means primordial Mother.

42:11.350 --> 42:12.869
She's the mother of Mumba

42:12.995 --> 42:16.413
and Mumba is the mother Amba, is Mumba.

42:16.694 --> 42:18.920
And She's the mother of, who is that?

42:19.239 --> 42:22.457
That's the Mahakali that's the Primordial Mother.

42:23.749 --> 42:26.274
They couldn't pronounce that word so they called it Bombay.

42:27.218 --> 42:29.149
That's how we've got Bombay and all those

42:29.174 --> 42:31.457
all words were ruined by them. All right!

42:31.764 --> 42:33.324
So this is the situation is.

42:33.475 --> 42:35.656
Now today's first thing we have to know

42:35.756 --> 42:38.173
that we are facing a very

42:38.741 --> 42:40.600
great crowds of mudhas,

42:41.360 --> 42:43.721
who're stuck up, stuck up there

42:43.933 --> 42:45.912
roots are dead

42:46.011 --> 42:49.662
and they 're stuck up like dead deep root somewhere.

42:50.358 --> 42:52.170
So to shake them is not easy,

42:53.000 --> 42:54.560
talk to them is not easy,

42:54.647 --> 42:56.935
to convince them is not at all easy because they think

42:56.960 --> 43:00.935
see they are all wise, Madrasies think they are the wisest.

43:00.960 --> 43:02.901
people as far as religion is concerned

43:03.065 --> 43:05.346
and I don't know where to look when they say that.

43:05.457 --> 43:06.957
See this is the trouble is.

43:07.098 --> 43:10.425
So with that understanding if you face

43:10.667 --> 43:15.170
because also, I think, Venugopalan told Me,

43:15.327 --> 43:18.219
"Mother, I'm sure it won't happen

43:18.250 --> 43:19.960
to the real Tamilians."

43:20.221 --> 43:22.355
I said, "Why?" He said, "They're no good,

43:22.467 --> 43:23.712
they can never get it,

43:23.737 --> 43:25.845
because I'm a Tamilian I know what it is."

43:25.881 --> 43:27.866
So I said, "Cannot happen to Tamilians?"

43:27.945 --> 43:30.055
He said, "No, because Murthy is not a Tamilian,

43:30.080 --> 43:31.055
Jayakar is not a Tamilian.

43:31.080 --> 43:32.356
They cannot be Tamilians.

43:32.381 --> 43:35.360
" I said, "Let's see the Tamilians also."

43:37.545 --> 43:40.606
He just could not think that Tamilians can take to it

43:40.842 --> 43:43.761
He said they are so dead into it, they cannot.

43:44.044 --> 43:47.097
We have so many now Tamilians also in

43:47.646 --> 43:52.037
Delhi but how many come to us, very few.

44:03.960 --> 44:04.960
So,

44:08.360 --> 44:10.200
Can you open the fan now?

44:14.240 --> 44:17.333
You start, who else will start.

44:20.506 --> 44:23.090
Can put that also. It's al   right, it won't go.

44:29.506 --> 44:31.879
Not so much you can put it little less

44:31.994 --> 44:33.414
you see, little movement.

44:34.157 --> 44:37.927
You didn't feel the hot, till the electricity had not come.

44:37.952 --> 44:39.554
Do you notice that?

44:41.048 --> 44:42.375
Didn't feel the hot at all.

44:42.400 --> 44:45.551
As soon as the electricity has come you have started feeling hot.

44:48.960 --> 44:52.024
I told him, "You don't worry I'll throw cold at them,

44:52.049 --> 44:53.211
they won't feel."

44:54.866 --> 44:55.935
None of you felt.

44:55.960 --> 44:58.749
As soon as the electricity has come you're feeling hot.

45:04.819 --> 45:06.126
What have you got?

45:06.258 --> 45:07.251
What is this?

45:09.604 --> 45:11.782
Kammer patta (Waist Belt ornament, worn around the waist).

45:11.960 --> 45:12.960
No that green coloured

45:13.200 --> 45:15.440
Yogi: That is. S M: Yes? Yogi: It's Tulsi.

45:16.000 --> 45:17.200
Yogi - Its a Tulsi (Herb basil)

45:28.120 --> 45:29.840
Yogi - Its a Tulsi (Herb)

45:30.960 --> 45:32.960
Yogi: Pachu (Precious Stones)  S M Anh?

45:34.960 --> 45:36.360
Yogi: Madras people come into the front.

45:37.960 --> 45:39.400
Yogi: Madras people to come.

45:41.360 --> 45:42.960
Yogi:Dawana( Fragrant Herb)

45:43.280 --> 45:44.960
Yogi: Its a Dawana,   S M :Its a Dawana

45:51.960 --> 45:52.960
S M: That is not Dawana

45:57.440 --> 46:00.040
Dawana and Tulasi ( Herbs)

46:03.440 --> 46:04.320
It is Dawana

46:16.200 --> 46:16.960
It is Dawana

46:17.160 --> 46:18.400
Where is Tulsi ? Tulsi is less

46:26.960 --> 46:28.320
Yogi: Some is not Tulsi. SM: Huh

46:28.960 --> 46:29.440
Smelling nice

46:34.240 --> 46:35.960
Yogi: Which flowers are these? S M: Its Ok

46:38.040 --> 46:38.960
All right!

46:43.824 --> 46:46.156
There's one thing we are missed on this,

46:47.971 --> 46:51.242
which I want to tell you about the Vedas now, as I told you

46:52.031 --> 46:54.440
In one lecture you can't cover the whole thing but in short

46:55.537 --> 46:57.573
that how they went into the

46:58.308 --> 47:01.295
abstraction of the chakras. Some might, might say

47:01.545 --> 47:03.514
that they didn't talk about the chakras,

47:03.764 --> 47:05.400
you see, because this is what they are

47:05.813 --> 47:08.368
it, it's not in the Vedas, it should not be anywhere else.

47:08.584 --> 47:11.493
I mean supposing in the beginning that was the situation

47:12.092 --> 47:13.739
then today this is the situation.

47:13.764 --> 47:17.375
Like, when a electricity started

47:17.400 --> 47:20.148
nobody knew much about, it they could hardly put

47:20.173 --> 47:23.628
a little flickering light, now today

47:23.698 --> 47:26.027
we have this, we have that, we don't refuse this

47:26.080 --> 47:27.960
because it was not there so it should not be there

47:28.095 --> 47:29.666
You see evolving and it is

47:29.826 --> 47:31.966
in aware, our awareness, it is coming.

47:32.040 --> 47:33.855
But they will always say, it's not written in that book.

47:33.880 --> 47:35.159
Book and that not into that.

47:35.574 --> 47:38.960
First time somebody wrote about Kundalini was actually

47:38.985 --> 47:42.306
I should say in a real sense of the word wrote properly

47:42.467 --> 47:44.178
was Adi Shankaracharya himself

47:44.554 --> 47:47.616
and then our, what you call, Gyaneshwara

47:47.725 --> 47:48.960
because that was the time

47:49.065 --> 47:50.960
and before that of course

47:51.275 --> 47:54.486
Markandeya wrote it, thousands of years back but

47:54.551 --> 47:57.689
who considered Markandeya as something, no one listened to him.

47:58.080 --> 48:00.375
So if the Vedas become everything they will say

48:00.400 --> 48:02.935
then what about your chakras, there's nothing in the Vedas.

48:02.960 --> 48:05.215
So it could be in some other books.

48:06.160 --> 48:08.223
Now Bhrigusamhita has written,

48:08.598 --> 48:11.660
Bhrigu has written a book called Nadi Granth, in that

48:11.685 --> 48:13.677
he has described complete sahaja yoga.

48:13.732 --> 48:15.960
He said that Kundalini will rise and this will happen.

48:16.213 --> 48:18.550
So the knowledge of the Kundalini we had since long

48:18.575 --> 48:20.831
but it was kept as a secret

48:22.052 --> 48:24.791
and was not discussed by the Sushumna people

48:26.443 --> 48:27.610
and they are the ones

48:27.635 --> 48:30.317
who formed this Machindernath, Gorakhnath all these people.

48:30.520 --> 48:33.552
Most of this work was done in Maharashtra.

48:33.702 --> 48:35.705
Most of it was done in Maharashtra

48:35.822 --> 48:38.783
and that's how we have the Sushumna path in the central path

48:39.006 --> 48:43.095
of ascent or realization was kept as a secret

48:43.120 --> 48:45.354
and we can say that there were two,

48:45.952 --> 48:48.180
two or one or two flowers

48:48.555 --> 48:49.960
one or two flowers

48:51.294 --> 48:53.073
on the tree of life

48:54.200 --> 48:55.960
but now we have many flowers.

48:56.360 --> 48:57.711
That's how we can tell.

48:57.915 --> 49:00.109
Then the essence how they discussed is that

49:00.440 --> 49:01.840
see, what they say "bhu"

49:02.688 --> 49:05.905
Bhu is the essence

49:05.930 --> 49:09.863
of Mooladhara- made from the Prithvi tattwa.

49:10.821 --> 49:13.323
Bhurva is the antriksh.

49:13.791 --> 49:17.672
Bhurva is the essence by which it was made the Bhurva.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.656
was made the antriksha, means all the elements and all that,

49:21.960 --> 49:23.366
is Brahmdeva's job.

49:23.741 --> 49:25.960
You call it Brahmdeva or Bhurva is the same,

49:26.340 --> 49:29.087
is the shakti of Brahmdeva is Bhurva.

49:29.440 --> 49:32.960
So Bhu Bhurva Swaha.

49:33.702 --> 49:35.116
the stomach is Swaha

49:35.444 --> 49:40.386
The shakti of the stomach is Swaha.

49:41.089 --> 49:42.960
Swaha is what

49:44.210 --> 49:49.000
to take everything in, burn it, digest it, swaha

49:50.474 --> 49:54.702
Then 'Manaha' is the essence of the

49:54.835 --> 49:56.560
heart chakra is manaha

49:57.280 --> 49:59.323
is mana, is the emotions

49:59.694 --> 50:03.758
is the mana, is the Parmesh God's emotions.

50:03.960 --> 50:07.905
is in the heart is Jagdamba there.

50:08.360 --> 50:09.960
Mana Jana

50:10.892 --> 50:13.053
is Shri Krishna, is for the jana.

50:14.412 --> 50:17.654
Jana is when Shri Krishna came on this Earth,

50:18.396 --> 50:20.347
when He thought of the people.

50:20.488 --> 50:23.781
He mixed with the people, He talked to them, He tried to spread

50:23.806 --> 50:27.633
and He's the Virata, so He is a collective,

50:27.672 --> 50:28.960
He's the collective being -

50:29.686 --> 50:33.152
so Jana Tapa, Tapa is Shri Christ

50:33.418 --> 50:35.960
because He went into tapaswita.

50:36.293 --> 50:37.920
His life was a tapasya,

50:38.105 --> 50:39.336
He went into tapa

50:39.783 --> 50:41.359
and the last is Satya,

50:41.396 --> 50:43.610
at the Sahasrara you know the truth.

50:48.680 --> 50:50.211
So all these seven things

50:50.579 --> 50:52.960
essence of all the chakras they are describing over here,

50:53.577 --> 50:55.413
in the Vedas

50:56.740 --> 50:57.959
but these, they will argue,

50:58.155 --> 51:01.840
they'll say the mantra of Gayatri, this, that, what is that ?

51:02.224 --> 51:04.421
Gayatri is the essence

51:07.960 --> 51:09.485
and that's the trouble with them is.

51:09.540 --> 51:11.618
By saying these mantras they go to the right side

51:11.643 --> 51:12.960
they are not there on the essence.

51:13.212 --> 51:14.589
the whole thing get's spoilt.

51:15.706 --> 51:17.448
Specially in Kashmir, I must say,

51:17.604 --> 51:19.704
they suffer from this Gayatri mantra.

51:22.790 --> 51:25.108
And the worst thing, that has happened to us

51:25.133 --> 51:27.960
now I don't know about other places but specially in Maharashtra

51:28.312 --> 51:31.689
we are two types of horrible Brahmins

51:32.048 --> 51:35.087
and there are other very good types of Brahmins also.

51:35.360 --> 51:36.840
But the bad ones I'm telling

51:37.342 --> 51:40.763
the ones who, who look after the temples

51:41.029 --> 51:42.776
and manage the temples

51:42.907 --> 51:45.624
and they think, Oh! we know what is God is,

51:46.019 --> 51:48.313
there's nothing like or we have made this God,

51:48.360 --> 51:51.960
God is all this is just a stone, we know how to manage.

51:52.118 --> 51:54.427
it's all Swayambhu and all this nonsense.

51:54.631 --> 51:57.220
So they, they are least afraid of God.

51:57.388 --> 51:59.935
They do all kinds of things, without being afraid of God

51:59.960 --> 52:02.754
because they think there is no God really, it's just a joke

52:03.078 --> 52:04.414
so one thing cancel.

52:05.314 --> 52:07.663
Second thing is that

52:07.688 --> 52:11.203
the people who are sort of educated out of them,

52:11.250 --> 52:13.960
they think it's dishonest to say, there is God

52:13.985 --> 52:15.973
because there is no God, better to say there is no God.

52:16.161 --> 52:18.935
Out of them have come out these Samajwadi's, you see,

52:18.960 --> 52:20.400
socialist like Kirloskar,

52:20.926 --> 52:22.375
Gorey all these people.

52:22.960 --> 52:24.763
They openly say there's no God

52:29.040 --> 52:29.960
openly.

52:32.320 --> 52:33.360
So that is how it is.

52:38.266 --> 52:40.410
Now,we have to understand that

52:40.528 --> 52:42.960
we are real Brahmins

52:43.559 --> 52:45.960
no doubt, assume your powers.

52:46.819 --> 52:50.512
know that you are real brahmins, you are the Brahmins.

52:50.931 --> 52:52.504
None of these are brahmin

52:52.960 --> 52:54.684
because you know the Brahm, this is the Brahm tattwa,

52:54.709 --> 52:56.610
you know how to handle it, you know the vibration.

52:56.656 --> 52:57.960
Chaitanya is the Brahm.

53:05.320 --> 53:06.960
Of course you are different than them

53:07.584 --> 53:10.671
so they are not allowed to enter into any temple, as you are.

53:10.866 --> 53:13.485
One day will come when that will happen you'll see that.

53:13.548 --> 53:16.519
we have to change the whole system upside down,

53:16.636 --> 53:17.960
otherwise things won't work out.

53:19.126 --> 53:20.916
The whole system has to be changed

53:22.671 --> 53:26.531
but still, because this a yoga bhumi

53:26.966 --> 53:29.945
still, you can find the truth in this Motherearth.

53:30.546 --> 53:32.550
Saints and saints have born.

53:32.960 --> 53:34.935
they have talked about all these things,

53:34.960 --> 53:38.602
so there is no chance of abusing anything much,

53:38.923 --> 53:41.162
cannot go to Mooladhara of that action

53:42.360 --> 53:43.519
that we understand.

53:44.173 --> 53:46.972
At least that wisdom we have we, we won't go that side

53:47.259 --> 53:48.704
that's the worst of all.

53:53.960 --> 53:56.960
Mother: For washing My feet, you do this,
remove it  from underneath

53:59.960 --> 54:01.960
Now call Madras yogies to wash the feet,

54:03.240 --> 54:05.360
Keep water here and recite Ganesha Stotra.

54:05.960 --> 54:07.960
Now do this, the one who in going to recite Mantras,

54:08.880 --> 54:09.960
will not do that thing,

54:09.960 --> 54:11.960
You come here, you understand everything.

54:12.320 --> 54:15.960
You recite the Mantra, you recite the Mantra
and you can recite there

54:16.120 --> 54:17.960
You bring the water.

54:22.960 --> 54:24.320
You are catching badly,

54:26.160 --> 54:27.200
You can get somebody else.

54:28.400 --> 54:29.960
Dani you come here.

54:31.960 --> 54:34.040
All are from Madras or else where?

54:50.160 --> 54:51.200
Yes, you come here.

54:52.240 --> 54:54.120
You just move there.

54:54.960 --> 54:57.080
feeling of a very strong catch,feeling hot vibrations? You see!

54:58.080 --> 54:59.160
It's very hot,

55:01.160 --> 55:01.960
Pick up

55:08.320 --> 55:09.960
God bless you! No

55:10.240 --> 55:11.160
Pour the water.

55:14.240 --> 55:15.400
Now recite.

55:15.960 --> 55:18.200
Now this is what it is washing My feet

55:18.960 --> 55:20.080
with the Ganesha stotram

55:22.240 --> 55:24.960
start this.

55:32.400 --> 55:35.080
Those who have not washed My feet raise their hands

55:36.040 --> 55:37.960
Yogis: Those who have not washed Mother's feet, those

55:38.080 --> 55:39.960
who have not washed previously

56:17.960 --> 56:18.960
Two persons

56:20.400 --> 56:21.960
You are still moving with  the ladle [Marathi]

56:37.080 --> 56:38.080
What you have

56:42.240 --> 56:42.960
Alright!

56:43.320 --> 56:44.280
Like that

56:46.960 --> 56:47.360
on the right
