Kazu Radio Interview. Santa Cruz, California (USA), 1 October 1983.

00:00:07.734 --> 00:00:08.898
Beautiful!

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:13.720
Bolo Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki! Jai!

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.360
Who is the gentleman who met Me in Kamini Kadam's house?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.086
Are right there.

00:00:28.286 --> 00:00:31.562
Hello, how do you do? Very nice to meet you. Both of you were there?

00:00:31.763 --> 00:00:33.501
- Yes.
- All right. May God bless you.

00:00:33.702 --> 00:00:35.505
- How are you sleeping?
- Fine, thank You.

00:00:35.706 --> 00:00:39.229
May God bless you. Nice to meet you again.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.520
Mother, a lady from Kazu Radio

00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:48.480
actually who is coming as a seeker

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.119
but has also arranged that, if an interview is possible.

00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:55.046
- All right.
- Barbara! This is Barbara.

00:00:55.247 --> 00:00:59.840
Yes. So today we should have questioning only will be good idea.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.280
All right?

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.759
- Thank you, Mother.
- May God bless you.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.519
Before we begin, I would like to introduce myself

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.848
to those of you in the room.

00:01:19.048 --> 00:01:22.787
My name is Barbara Schuler and I do a radio program

00:01:22.988 --> 00:01:27.014
on a station from Monterrey called Discovery

00:01:27.215 --> 00:01:31.640
which is usually on Wednesdays from 1 to 2:30,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.400
and is going to be now on Thursdays to 11:30 to 1 o’clock.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.080
And it’s my privilege to be here

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.640
to do a taped interview for my listeners.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.550
So for the listeners I would like to say

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:50.800
that we are at Kennolyn Campgrounds in Santa Cruz

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
and this is an interview with Her Holiness Mataji.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.840
Mother, today there are many, many things said about Sahaja Yoga,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.680
about Your philosophy

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.791
and very little was said about who You are as a person.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.840
And I thought it would be good to start out with some,

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.440
few questions about who You are, who were You as a child,

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.480
what people influenced You,

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.040
what brought You to the place You are today

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.400
as a Luminous Being sitting before me and before us?

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.880
I am a very ancient being – that problem is like this, you see?

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.880
And to… what can I tell you about Myself?

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.120
I just don’t know what part will interest you,

00:02:35.917 --> 00:02:40.400
but only thing I can say

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.359
that I was born with this understanding and awareness

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.480
that I have to find out a method

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.360
by which I could give en mass Realization to people.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.419
I was a Realized soul, of course.

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.249
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

00:03:01.471 --> 00:03:06.911
But the problem was that how to make many people get it,

00:03:07.112 --> 00:03:09.439
because if one person gets it

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.680
or one person has it,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.040
if one person is an incarnation,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.520
people don’t understand it.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.799
Not only that but they may even try to destroy such a person.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.840
That’s what happened to all the saints who came on this earth.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.840
Christ was crucified,

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.028
Mohammed Sahib was given poison.

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:29.999
Because they were ignorant.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.840
They did not know what it was, what was He saying.

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.900
So it was important first of all

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:41.119
to find out a method how to give them

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.280
en mass Realization.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.220
And from that angle I just thought

00:03:48.421 --> 00:03:50.863
that this is why I am on this earth

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:53.359
and I have to do this job,

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.280
for which I wanted to study about human beings.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.840
I took My birth in a Christian family

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:04.640
and that too a family which was Protestant family,

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.800
because I felt that

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:12.120
Protestants are fanatics but very sophisticated.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.320
And they rationalize everything to such an extent

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:20.640
that nobody can see beyond it.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:23.840
So I better take My birth in them.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:26.959
And My father and mother had already taken birth

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.920
whom I had chosen as My parents.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.520
They were great people, realized souls

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.960
and specially My father

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.160
was a person who knew why I was on this earth.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.280
Even My mother knew about it.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.359
So a special rapport was between them and Me

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.929
and they could understand

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:53.592
why I was busy meditating

00:04:53.793 --> 00:04:58.240
or finding out about how to give Realization to others.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.480
Then I would say My father who was a very learned man,

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.960
who knew about fourteen languages,

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.640
who translated Quran-e-Sharif into Hindi,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.760
who was a member of the Constituent Assembly,

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:11.478
He made our Constitution.

00:05:11.679 --> 00:05:16.360
Also he was the only Christian to be elected in those days.

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.720
And then My mother was a honors in Mathematics,

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:25.000
all very well-educated and nice people.

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.360
They dedicated their life

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:30.360
to the cause of freedom of India.

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.320
And I also felt that, that was very important,

00:05:33.521 --> 00:05:36.160
because if we are not free

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.880
we cannot do anything on religious basis.

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.160
There’s one thing is to be free from this level.

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.280
And that’s how I also helped them a lot

00:05:47.481 --> 00:05:49.518
and our whole family suffered a lot.

00:05:49.719 --> 00:05:52.575
And I went through terrible times, terrible times,

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:54.279
since very young age.

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:56.334
I was with Mahatma Gandhi also

00:05:56.535 --> 00:05:58.747
because he liked Me very much as a child.

00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:00.173
So I stayed on with him

00:06:00.374 --> 00:06:03.359
then I used to come back to study, again go back to him.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:05.040
He used to call Me “Nepali”

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.680
because My face is a Nepali face.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.520
And he used to talk to Me

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:11.760
as if he is talking to his grandmother sometimes.

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:14.560
He was very sweet and he was a very sweet man

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.000
– extremely sweet person to children -

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:21.600
very strict with himself and strict with others elderly people.

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:26.400
But with children he was very, very sweet and kind

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:31.400
and would try to learn from children lot of things.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.680
It was surprising how he understood

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:37.160
that there’s lot of wisdom with the children sometimes

00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:42.006
than with the older people who are mixed up.

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:47.119
Now we got our independence

00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:50.510
and we had a very bad setback

00:06:50.711 --> 00:06:55.200
because of the partition we had in our country.

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.080
And I was studying in Lahore Medical College there

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:01.960
because I wanted to know about medicine

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.063
what these people call such and such thing,

00:07:05.264 --> 00:07:07.800
because I knew all this but, I knew about the body,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.280
I knew about everything, the

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.120
what you call the complete nervous system

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:16.200
but I did not know what was the vocabulary attached to it,

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.319
so I studied there for two years.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.960
Now after that, this war broke out,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.280
so I had to discontinue with My studies

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.760
and My parents wanted Me to get married.

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.917
And then I found that My marriage was important,

00:07:30.118 --> 00:07:31.321
I agreed to marry

00:07:31.522 --> 00:07:35.225
and I married this gentleman, Mr. C.P. Srivastava.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:38.435
Then during all that time,

00:07:38.636 --> 00:07:43.383
My only pastime or the full-time work

00:07:43.583 --> 00:07:45.406
was to find out about human beings,

00:07:45.607 --> 00:07:47.280
what’s the problem they have,

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.880
how they avoid reality,

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.760
how they shun it, how they run away from it,

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:55.680
what are their problems,

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:01.039
how are they seeking, what do they have to offer,

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:03.680
what will they accept, how to handle them.

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:05.440
It was quite a intricate question.

00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:09.760
Every person provided a new sample of problems

00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:11.690
and I had to fight it out.

00:08:11.891 --> 00:08:16.071
In a way that it was a system which I knew how to do it,

00:08:16.272 --> 00:08:19.476
because to enter into somebody subtly,

00:08:19.677 --> 00:08:22.000
to understand the problems of the Kundalini –

00:08:22.201 --> 00:08:26.967
you can go into the journey and find out about a person.

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.384
And then I found out

00:08:28.585 --> 00:08:31.880
the permutations and combinations of their problems.

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:35.480
So like, it is like, you can say, that, like periodic tables.

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.880
You had to divide them into three, then into seven,

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.160
then into their permutations and combinations.

00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.760
So you can imagine - three into seven, raised to power eternity.

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.181
It was like that.

00:08:46.382 --> 00:08:49.880
But doesn’t matter! It worked out and

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:55.990
in the year 1970,

00:08:56.191 --> 00:08:58.399
on the 5th of May,

00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:02.120
I was little bit hesitant at that time.

00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:04.748
I thought I should wait but certain circumstances

00:09:04.949 --> 00:09:09.839
made Me to open the last center.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.035
And when I opened the last center,

00:09:13.568 --> 00:09:17.168
it started working with others, it went on en mass scale.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:20.760
But still I gave Realization only to

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.920
one lady who came to My house.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:26.080
I tried if it works out with her.

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:28.850
And she, I gave her Realization,

00:09:29.051 --> 00:09:32.252
by touching her centers one by one

00:09:32.453 --> 00:09:33.599
- six centers -

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.480
and then bringing out the Kundalini on top of the head.

00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:40.200
What does it mean to open the last center?
SM: The Sahasrara?

00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:44.320
Last center is the center which is the limbic area;

00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.240
where is the seat of all the seven centers.

00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:50.120
It’s all integration there.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.200
So far, everybody who has come

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.000
- like Christ has come on this center,

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.880
what you call the Agnya Chakra,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.519
or Krishna has come on this center which is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.439
Like that they have been appearing on every center of ours

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.720
giving us a new dimension to our awareness.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:11.520
And that’s how our awareness has improved to this extent

00:10:11.719 --> 00:10:15.879
and now the time is for you to get your Absolute,

00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:19.279
to get your Spirit,

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.320
that your Spirit must shine into your attention,

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:29.080
that you should have your Self-Realization,

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.560
that you should have your second birth.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:35.800
That’s the time! And that is only possible if baptism,

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.120
the real baptism works out – real, not artificial,

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.120
somebody coming and putting the hand on your head and saying,

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.600
“Now you are baptized”.  That’s not the way.

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.789
But it is a real thing that happens that you start feeling

00:10:47.990 --> 00:10:51.200
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of you.

00:10:52.376 --> 00:10:57.320
So then I started giving first of all Realization

00:10:57.520 --> 00:11:00.880
without confronting any kind of a position or anything.

00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:04.720
I started with one lady, then I went ahead with it.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.640
Then the first twelve people got Realization.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.120
Then I was very happy

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:12.000
because en mass Realization has started.

00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.040
Then gradually it started working out.

00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:17.400
I went to Indian villages.

00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.280
I thought they are better, simple people,

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.600
first work on the simpler people. And they got Realization.

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.680
Now we have thousands of people in the villages

00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:27.600
who have got Realization.

00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.640
They have dropped out all their bad habits.

00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:31.680
They have become very creative.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.800
They are doing very well. They are very happy people.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:36.284
And they are experts.

00:11:36.484 --> 00:11:39.512
So many of them are experts I can say in India now,

00:11:39.713 --> 00:11:41.319
whom we call as Sahaja Yogi,

00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.960
may be in thousands.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:44.713
Some are working in the villages,

00:11:44.913 --> 00:11:46.759
some are working in some cities.

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.640
So we have lots of people now in India, who can do this job.

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:53.359
This all happened since 1970?

00:11:53.559 --> 00:11:55.679
- I started it.
- [So You started]...

00:11:55.880 --> 00:11:59.560
I have a question that’s important to me

00:11:59.799 --> 00:12:04.711
and to many people who are searching for something as they think,

00:12:04.912 --> 00:12:07.200
perhaps what you call Self Realization

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.760
or Sahaja Yoga or something.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.265
We, some of us don’t know exactly what it is.

00:12:13.466 --> 00:12:16.119
And we find that there are many teachers.

00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:19.040
How do we recognize those teachers

00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.480
that You might call fraudulent from the real ones?

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:25.920
It’s so difficult because they all seem to be able to

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:28.920
inspire us in certain ways and give us experiences.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:33.121
How do we know who is teaching something that’s true

00:12:33.322 --> 00:12:35.680
and who is being deceptive?

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.440
SM: First and foremost thing is:

00:12:37.640 --> 00:12:42.040
anybody who lives on your earnings is not a guru.

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:47.240
A guru will never live on the earnings of his disciples.

00:12:47.568 --> 00:12:50.088
But here there are people who have big palaces,

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:53.840
bought aircrafts and cars and this.

00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:55.902
I mean, this is something one should understand.

00:12:56.103 --> 00:13:00.760
It’s so, so open to you to understand.

00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:05.873
I mean, I cannot understand more obvious thing that this one is

00:13:06.074 --> 00:13:07.600
that it’s a parasitic living.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:10.400
And you cannot have a parasites as your gurus.

00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:13.080
They can be parasites but not your gurus.

00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:16.040
That’s one of the things. And if you can…

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:19.680
I mean, you can retain some people, you know?

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.520
If you want because you are rich people, you can retain some.

00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:25.520
That’s a different point. But you cannot have them as gurus.

00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:28.839
Guru has to be a higher personality, you see?

00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:33.520
Now you have seen Christ was such a great incarnation.

00:13:33.796 --> 00:13:35.720
He didn’t take any money from anyone.

00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.261
He was a carpenter’s son and He used to do carpentry Himself

00:13:39.462 --> 00:13:41.160
and He lived like a modest man.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.465
He never lived with big cars and big houses. It’s not necessary

00:13:45.666 --> 00:13:49.346
because such a person is Himself, He is a very big king, you see,

00:13:49.547 --> 00:13:51.600
like a big emperor.

00:13:51.840 --> 00:13:54.477
He doesn’t need anything, an emperor doesn’t need anything

00:13:54.678 --> 00:13:57.421
because nothing can give him comfort

00:13:57.622 --> 00:14:00.240
except that He Himself is in complete comfort.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:02.680
So such a person doesn’t want anything.

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:07.080
So you must see that such a person has no needs of comfort at all.

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:10.920
He can sleep on the grounds, he can sleep anywhere.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.000
Now, in this life,

00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:16.440
I should say I come from a quite a wealthy family

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:19.893
or married to another wealthy man, you can say that way,

00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:22.960
according to your own relative ideas.

00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:26.322
But to Me,

00:14:26.523 --> 00:14:28.640
I can sleep anywhere. I have no problem.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:30.120
I have no problem of food,

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:32.960
no problem of sleeping anywhere, no comfort.

00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.640
And I find it is beyond My self-respect

00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:39.520
to live on the earnings of others. It’s not proper.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:40.898
But you are My children;

00:14:41.099 --> 00:14:44.383
supposing now you bring a flower to Me or something, it’s all right.

00:14:44.584 --> 00:14:48.063
But I can’t have a palace out of your money and all those things.

00:14:48.264 --> 00:14:49.840
It’s absurd, absolutely absurd!

00:14:50.041 --> 00:14:53.840
So this is one thing one should know that it pampers our ego,

00:14:54.040 --> 00:14:56.120
that we can purchase our guru,

00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:58.440
we can purchase our Self-Realization.

00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:01.720
You see, this is a very subtle pampering.

00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.760
And that’s how people accept, you see?

00:15:03.960 --> 00:15:07.240
They don’t want to accept a person who says,

00:15:07.480 --> 00:15:10.040
“You cannot offer anything.”  It’s too much for them.

00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.858
Or maybe that, secondly, could be that people think

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:18.839
that if you pay something then you get attached to it,

00:15:19.039 --> 00:15:20.734
you go through it whatever it is.

00:15:20.935 --> 00:15:23.139
Say you have paid for a ticket

00:15:23.340 --> 00:15:26.186
and you find that the whole play is horrid, you can’t bear it,

00:15:26.387 --> 00:15:28.774
but you have to go through it because you have paid for it.

00:15:28.975 --> 00:15:30.359
That’s a human nature, you see?

00:15:30.560 --> 00:15:32.720
That’s a human nature. I have seen that they do it.

00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:34.720
And that’s what it works out.

00:15:34.920 --> 00:15:37.040
But this is very gross level, I’m telling you.

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:41.014
But another should be that in these modern times it is promised

00:15:41.215 --> 00:15:43.680
that you will become prophets.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:46.440
You have to become prophets.

00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:50.040
So you must see have you become prophets out of these?

00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:53.880
Is... easiest is to see the disciples of this man,

00:15:54.080 --> 00:15:56.080
any XYZ who says he is a guru.

00:15:56.320 --> 00:15:59.520
Now what is happening to the disciple? Is he a free person?

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.520
Has he got any knowledge?

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.560
Has he got any mastery?

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.748
What has he achieved by being with that person?

00:16:05.949 --> 00:16:07.849
Now, you have seen here there are Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:08.050 --> 00:16:09.129
One better than the other!

00:16:09.330 --> 00:16:11.920
You talk to them, they are knowledge.

00:16:13.106 --> 00:16:15.885
Some of them have met Me only for, say, eight day or so.

00:16:16.086 --> 00:16:17.519
They have become knowledge.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.480
So what have they achieved you should say.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:23.485
What is their style of life, their pattern of life, how they behave?

00:16:23.686 --> 00:16:26.030
And there cannot be any privacy about it,

00:16:26.231 --> 00:16:27.480
you see, like mafia -

00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:29.960
you don’t tell that and you don’t say that

00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:31.360
and you shouldn’t do that.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:33.520
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.480
the truth is exposed gradually,

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.461
but it is not like this that if you give some money, nobody knows.

00:16:40.662 --> 00:16:43.180
Everybody knows everything in Sahaja Yoga, you see?

00:16:43.381 --> 00:16:47.186
Now supposing we have to build an ashram, say for example.

00:16:47.387 --> 00:16:49.681
All right, you build your ashram, you collect your money,

00:16:49.882 --> 00:16:52.514
do what you like and know about it. I have nothing to do with it.

00:16:52.715 --> 00:16:55.040
Also among yourself you should know how you got the money,

00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:57.920
how you spent it, what is the expense and all that.

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.703
Because ashram you can pay for

00:17:00.904 --> 00:17:03.320
but not for your Realization.

00:17:03.838 --> 00:17:06.959
And this is one thing is very important,

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:09.600
that what you get out of it is important,

00:17:09.800 --> 00:17:12.440
that you should become a prophet.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.200
Have you become a prophet?

00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.680
Then, thirdly, you must know that if
you are going from one to another,

00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:20.320
what we call guru shopping business

00:17:20.560 --> 00:17:21.960
that means you have not found it.

00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:23.960
Otherwise, you would just settle down.

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:27.360
But some people are so weak that they do settle down with one

00:17:27.560 --> 00:17:29.400
and are finished with them.

00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:31.320
You must always see the people

00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:34.279
who go to these gurus, what have they got.

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:37.880
Have they got their transformation?

00:17:39.023 --> 00:17:41.880
Because this is the age of transformation.

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:46.280
Mataji, what about teachers or gurus who produce miracles?

00:17:46.480 --> 00:17:48.642
You go to a guru

00:17:48.843 --> 00:17:51.919
who materialize something out of the air and say, “This is divine”.

00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:53.506
That’s a very serious question.

00:17:53.707 --> 00:17:55.199
This is all jugglery. It’s all jugglery.

00:17:55.400 --> 00:17:57.800
And also, you see, now supposing somebody says,

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.600
“I produce a diamond”.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:01.240
Now these people come from India.

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:05.320
Why don’t they solve the financial problem of India?

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.039
Secondly, you see, at every point they can be challenged.

00:18:13.240 --> 00:18:15.040
You should say that, "Then, all right"...

00:18:15.240 --> 00:18:17.809
One gentleman came to Me; he said that, “He gave me a diamond.”

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:19.813
I said, “Why you? How many diamonds you have?”

00:18:20.014 --> 00:18:22.057
He has said, “Hundreds.” Then I said, “Why did he give you?

00:18:22.258 --> 00:18:24.720
He should give to your driver who hasn’t got a diamond”.

00:18:24.920 --> 00:18:28.160
You see, that is what it is. So it is all jugglery.

00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:31.120
You should see those who materialize,

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:33.240
what have they given you?

00:18:33.440 --> 00:18:35.720
They have to give you something eternal.

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.360
If they talk about God,

00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.120
God is not going to give you diamond.

00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.160
Which God has given diamonds to people?

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.600
Have you heard of anyone giving diamonds? No!

00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:49.600
So you should ask for something which is the highest,

00:18:49.800 --> 00:18:51.840
which is the supreme most.

00:18:52.080 --> 00:18:55.600
Now the fourth thing, which is very important,

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:59.040
that whatever experiences you get -

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.640
for example, some people start just like jumping,

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:05.000
some start shouting, some start behaving like animals.

00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:07.440
And they say, “Oh, that’s what is coming out.

00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:08.800
You are taking out, you see.”

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:12.200
They feel very bad, they get horrible diseases,

00:19:12.400 --> 00:19:14.840
they get into troubles and they get into pains

00:19:15.040 --> 00:19:17.040
and all sorts of things and contortions.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:19.560
They say, “Now, your subconscious is coming out”.

00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:22.920
Nothing has to be brought out. That’s one thing you must know.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:26.000
The subconscious, as I told you, is on the left hand side

00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:28.680
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:33.400
What you have to do is to ascend in the center and come up.

00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.439
Above your head is the super-consciousness

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:38.400
and when you become that,

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:41.240
then you develop collective consciousness.

00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:45.200
So those who want you to become like frogs again,

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.283
you must know that you are not going to become frogs anymore.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.280
That’s not anyway evolution.

00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:55.120
The evolution has to go higher,

00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:58.200
not becoming frogs or earthworms, you see?

00:19:58.400 --> 00:20:01.760
And if you start crawling, it is simple mesmerism.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.040
Anybody mesmerizes can do these tricks, you see?

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:06.600
It’s simple mesmerism.

00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:09.992
And then to believe that now you are surrendered and all that

00:20:10.193 --> 00:20:11.720
is all nonsense, you see?

00:20:11.920 --> 00:20:15.240
It has no meaning to Realization.

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.880
In Realization, you just become the master.

00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:20.040
You become the master of it.

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:23.280
There are many people in this country who came

00:20:23.680 --> 00:20:26.360
and lured you by their talks also,

00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:31.640
talking big about Brahma, Atmatattva, this, that and everything.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:33.125
That is not the way you can,

00:20:33.325 --> 00:20:36.345
that is what is just the pendulum moving

00:20:36.546 --> 00:20:39.209
from Christian sermon to Hindu sermon

00:20:39.410 --> 00:20:41.879
and from Hindu sermon to Islamic sermon,

00:20:42.079 --> 00:20:44.158
from there to the Rabbi sermon.

00:20:44.359 --> 00:20:47.120
You see, it goes on like that, you see? That’s not the way.

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:49.440
You have to rise higher within yourself.

00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.920
And that’s why those who lecture about these things

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.960
are really sometimes can be very, very dangerous.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.520
And so many have died of cancer, this, that.

00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:01.400
I don’t know what to say that people who go to these people

00:21:01.600 --> 00:21:04.520
get into very bad troubles and suffer so much.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.040
And then on top of that when all this happens,

00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.440
they say, “You must suffer.”

00:21:10.640 --> 00:21:12.480
That’s a very good excuse, “You must suffer”.

00:21:12.681 --> 00:21:14.320
You must pay to suffer.

00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:17.160
Pay money to suffer.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.640
And then people go on suffering.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:23.200
Now one thing I have to tell you that Christ has suffered for us.

00:21:23.400 --> 00:21:25.000
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:28.600
Those who deny His sufferings, will have to go for suffering.

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:31.360
All right, have it! But He suffered for us.

00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.040
There is no need for us to suffer anymore.

00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:36.200
When He is awakened within us,

00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.560
He takes away all that is our ego means our karmas,

00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:43.280
our superego, that is our conditioning, completely removed,

00:21:43.480 --> 00:21:45.680
and you become one with the Divine.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:48.120
There is no need for anybody to suffer

00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:51.040
and this idea of suffering is all nonsensical.

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.040
You should not suffer at all.

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:56.400
Good!

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:59.320
I’m glad it’s over.

00:22:03.112 --> 00:22:05.712
- Mataji, You are called “Mother”.
- Yes.

00:22:05.960 --> 00:22:08.000
It seems that in Hindu tradition

00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:12.908
there is a special context or meaning of the word “Mother”.

00:22:13.108 --> 00:22:14.446
What is this meaning?

00:22:14.647 --> 00:22:18.831
You see, in the Indian philosophy,

00:22:19.032 --> 00:22:21.517
even in the Christian philosophy it is so,

00:22:21.718 --> 00:22:24.080
but it has been little bit changed -

00:22:24.280 --> 00:22:26.880
if you read the books of Essenes, you will find

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:28.800
that they have described the “Mother”,

00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.680
you see, the Holy Ghost is the Mother.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:33.122
When they say about the Holy Ghost, She is the Mother.

00:22:33.323 --> 00:22:35.663
But how can you have… You must reason it out.

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.160
How can you have a Father and a Son without a Mother?

00:22:38.360 --> 00:22:40.720
It’s a, you see, simple thing like that.

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.320
You see, so it’s the Mother only. Holy Ghost is very important.

00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:45.994
So Holy Ghost is the Mother.

00:22:46.194 --> 00:22:48.691
You see, it's an absurd thing, I mean, to have such a thing.

00:22:48.892 --> 00:22:51.160
Even homosexuals cannot have children.

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.480
It’s funny thing, isn’t it? Absolutely absurd!

00:22:53.680 --> 00:22:56.160
But Christians accepted this, I don’t know why.

00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:58.160
Why didn’t they go into, find out

00:22:58.360 --> 00:23:00.040
what is this Holy Ghost business is?

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.720
They said, “It’s a mystery”. How can you say it’s a mystery?

00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.080
When you cannot explain then better not say anything about it.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:08.280
So Holy Ghost is something hanging in the air.

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:10.160
No one knows; it’s a mystery

00:23:10.361 --> 00:23:13.040
and the rest of it is the Father and the Son. It’s absurd!

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:18.038
Now the principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture,

00:23:18.239 --> 00:23:19.520
has to be there.

00:23:19.720 --> 00:23:22.120
Now the Mother’s character is that

00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:25.920
She is the One Who is the Womb,

00:23:26.440 --> 00:23:28.840
She is the One Who is the Mother Earth

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.400
and She is the One Who nourishes you.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:33.720
She nourishes us, you know that.

00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:38.200
And this feminine thing in every human being

00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:40.680
resides as this Kundalini as you have seen.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:44.160
And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness

00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.640
which becomes compassion, which is flowing,

00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:55.559
which becomes soothing, nourishing energy of love.

00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:58.200
And that’s what today people are saying feminist -

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.440
all this thing and all that. That’s again a pendulum

00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:02.720
- a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man -

00:24:02.920 --> 00:24:05.160
all these problems you have had because of this.

00:24:05.361 --> 00:24:09.039
But when you move spirally upward,

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:12.040
then where do you move you become

00:24:12.280 --> 00:24:17.480
a personality full of compassion, of love,

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:21.320
of universal understanding,

00:24:21.760 --> 00:24:23.680
through collective consciousness.

00:24:23.880 --> 00:24:26.040
And then you rise up to a position

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.879
where you become universally conscious.

00:24:29.080 --> 00:24:31.133
So that is what should happen to you.

00:24:31.334 --> 00:24:34.201
And if that happens, then we should say

00:24:34.402 --> 00:24:37.840
that your motherly qualities within you have risen.

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.400
And that’s what we have so far neglected.

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:43.920
You do not become a woman but you become motherly.

00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:48.840
First the Father, then the Son and now the Mother! All right?

00:24:49.040 --> 00:24:52.120
What is the role of woman in this world,

00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.560
the role of the feminine principle?

00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:57.496
I would say, I don’t say that women

00:24:57.697 --> 00:25:00.320
as women who are born as women only have the role,

00:25:00.520 --> 00:25:02.586
even the men have, everyone has,

00:25:02.787 --> 00:25:04.959
because everyone has Kundalini within them.

00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:07.760
But the women must know that if they are women,

00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:10.160
they have a greater responsibility.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:13.120
Not that they should sit at home and only look after children

00:25:13.320 --> 00:25:16.960
and brood and then nag the husbands when they come home.

00:25:19.383 --> 00:25:20.806
That’s not their role.

00:25:21.007 --> 00:25:25.240
The role is such that they have to be forbearing.

00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.760
Any person who is the mother

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:30.280
has to be like the Mother Earth.

00:25:30.480 --> 00:25:33.240
How much She is forbearing! How much She suffers!

00:25:33.480 --> 00:25:36.920
We dig Her out, we torture Her life

00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.400
still She is giving all the time;

00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:42.560
She is soothing, forgiving, bearing it out, you see.

00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.840
Then we are doing so many sinful things,

00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:47.800
I mean, She should explode real with anger, the way it is.

00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.120
But She does not, She is very careful,

00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:51.960
She slowly, slowly informs that,

00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:55.479
“Now get out of this place, it’s rumbling”.

00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:58.760
She is so kind, you see? That all should come to us.

00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.080
So it’s not that it is only the women

00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:03.280
who should settle down with these qualities,

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.000
but the time has come that men have to have these qualities.

00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.320
Otherwise, there will be always an imbalance.

00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:10.558
So now the men have to become

00:26:10.759 --> 00:26:14.240
extremely kind, affectionate, compassionate.

00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:16.440
Give up that competitive spirit,

00:26:16.640 --> 00:26:19.160
that fighting spirit like Napoleon had.

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:21.160
All those ideas are outdated.

00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:24.800
Now whom do you respect? People like Mahatma Gandhi

00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:27.080
or Abraham Lincoln.

00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:31.360
Everyone...an American should think of Abraham Lincoln.

00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:33.840
Yes, indeed.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.440
Mother, what are we doing here?

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:38.400
What is the purpose of life on earth?

00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:42.240
What are human beings walking around on this planet for?

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.284
You are specially made by God.

00:26:44.484 --> 00:26:47.783
You are specially chosen by God to be human beings

00:26:47.984 --> 00:26:50.520
and you are here with a very great purpose.

00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.456
The first purpose of God

00:26:52.657 --> 00:26:57.209
is that you should become the vehicle of God’s powers,

00:26:57.409 --> 00:26:58.588
completely.

00:26:58.789 --> 00:27:00.880
So that He flows through you,

00:27:01.080 --> 00:27:05.040
He flows into this atmosphere,

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:08.000
into this universe, to make it a divine place.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:11.040
If you, when you get Realization, what happens?

00:27:11.240 --> 00:27:14.320
These – all your abnormalities drop out

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:16.680
and you become very normal person

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:20.280
and these vibrations of cool breeze start flowing.

00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:22.640
With this now you can give it to Mother Earth,

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.240
you can give it to the plants, you can give it to the trees.

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.960
The whole thing becomes a “Garden of Allah”,

00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.880
where you reside in complete joy and happiness.

00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:34.624
The second purpose is,

00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:36.895
that God has prepared you now,

00:27:37.095 --> 00:27:38.959
to settle into His Kingdom.

00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:42.640
That’s your throne. That’s your right to be there.

00:27:42.880 --> 00:27:44.520
It could have been short circuited

00:27:44.720 --> 00:27:47.760
at a time when Adam and Eve were called

00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:52.000
and told not to go into this so-called “book of knowledge”

00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:54.000
or the “fruit of knowledge”.

00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.406
But they didn’t listen.

00:27:55.607 --> 00:27:58.068
You see, f you give freedom to someone then, “What’s wrong?”

00:27:58.269 --> 00:28:01.640
So they started doing things which were brought to them

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:04.320
by a satanic force and they accepted it.

00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.880
So that was the original sin we have committed.

00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.960
So they had to take incarnations, do all those things

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.120
and now brought it to this level

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:16.274
where human beings have to be brought again back

00:28:16.475 --> 00:28:19.247
to the position where they were to go.

00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:23.760
Mother, what is the true nature of death?

00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:26.640
Is it possible that you can choose not to die?

00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.959
What’s the purpose of death?

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.679
You see, death is just like changing your clothes.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.720
So sometimes when you use too much of your clothes, get tired,

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:39.029
you want to change it. Like that death is.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:41.504
Nobody dies, there’s nothing that dies

00:28:41.705 --> 00:28:44.273
except that the part that is the Mother Earth

00:28:44.474 --> 00:28:48.429
and the part that is the water falls off

00:28:48.629 --> 00:28:50.359
and you remain as you are.

00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:52.920
But if you are a realized soul, then you have a choice.

00:28:53.120 --> 00:28:56.079
If you want to be born again, you would like to reborn.

00:28:56.279 --> 00:28:58.839
If you don’t want to be born, you will not be born.

00:28:59.040 --> 00:29:02.600
But after Realization, it becomes your choice.

00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.440
If you want to die, you can die.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.348
If you don’t want to die, you need not die.

00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:10.840
But you want, because you think that,

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:16.600
“Let us die and come back as new people

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:18.800
again to help Mother.”

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000
Many of us have heard discussions or read in books

00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.560
about the evolution of matter, the evolution of the substance.

00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:31.360
What are Your views on evolving matter

00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:34.400
and how does this relate to our own physical matter

00:29:34.640 --> 00:29:36.480
in our bodies or cells?

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.520
So the matter did go into evolution, you know that,

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.080
and when the carbon was established,

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:44.200
actually our first chakra was established.

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:46.800
That’s carbon which is tetravalent and

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:50.120
carbon is the one which started producing amino acids.

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:55.280
You see, when amino acid started manifesting itself this...

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:59.639
then the other processes took place by which the evolution

00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:04.880
of, say from amoeba to human stage took place.

00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:08.640
That also we understand very well after getting Realization,

00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:11.960
how we became from amoeba to human stage;

00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:17.963
and after human stage we have to achieve our Self Realization,

00:30:18.164 --> 00:30:21.697
means the Spirit which is in our heart,

00:30:21.898 --> 00:30:24.000
has to manifest in our attention,

00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.800
or we have to feel it on central nervous system.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.000
But what is the relationship between matter and this?

00:30:30.200 --> 00:30:32.320
We should see that point. It’s important.

00:30:32.520 --> 00:30:35.800
Now through the matter all our centers are made.

00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:38.420
For example, the two centers that are down below

00:30:38.621 --> 00:30:41.960
are made of the Mother Earth principle.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.840
And then another one and another one like that.

00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.400
All these elements have contributed to make the centers.

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:52.600
And these centers are just like mirrors made

00:30:52.800 --> 00:30:56.440
and the reflection of the Divine falls on them.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:31:00.680
Then at a human level the matter improves so much,

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:03.139
goes into such evolutionary processes,

00:31:03.340 --> 00:31:07.600
that the reflection at the heart level improves so much

00:31:07.800 --> 00:31:09.398
that the Spirit shines there,

00:31:09.599 --> 00:31:14.360
and the Kundalini is properly set for your evolution,

00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.440
which is the epitome of evolution.

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:19.280
Like this instrument that is made one by one,

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.560
first collecting this part, that part, that part,

00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:22.836
then put together.

00:31:23.037 --> 00:31:26.040
Now the time has come for you to be put to the mains.

00:31:26.240 --> 00:31:29.120
Now this has nothing to do with the electricity, if you see.

00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:32.560
It exists without electricity but it can carry the electricity.

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.680
In the same way, we become the lamp,

00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.920
and when we become the lamp the light can be brought in

00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:39.800
and we become enlightened.

00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:44.320
So there is a big relationship between the lamp and the light.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.480
But light cannot exist without the lamp,

00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.879
so lamp has to be there.

00:31:50.080 --> 00:31:52.280
Mother, can I ask you a question about sex?

00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:54.480
Yes, please.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.104
It was stated today that sex has nothing to do with evolution

00:32:00.305 --> 00:32:02.279
the way it’s been described in Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:03.880
What does this mean?

00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.320
You see the thing is that we think that by doing sex

00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:09.560
or by going into sex we can evolve.

00:32:09.760 --> 00:32:11.320
It’s absolutely falsehood.

00:32:11.520 --> 00:32:15.764
You have not become a human being from amoeba to this stage

00:32:15.965 --> 00:32:17.033
by doing sex.

00:32:17.234 --> 00:32:19.640
Because animals all do sex, everybody does sex.

00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:21.920
If they do it or not, makes no difference!

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:24.973
The thing is the evolution takes place

00:32:25.174 --> 00:32:26.471
only through your seeking.

00:32:26.672 --> 00:32:30.920
When you start seeking something, then only you evolve.

00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:33.058
And the seeking first was for food,

00:32:33.259 --> 00:32:35.078
if you see in the animals was for food, you see.

00:32:35.279 --> 00:32:36.520
Sex was spontaneous.

00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:38.960
They don’t think about it; they don’t read about it;

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.560
they don’t have any education about it – nothing.

00:32:41.761 --> 00:32:44.801
Sex comes all spontaneously, just like your breathing, you see.

00:32:45.002 --> 00:32:47.870
You don’t have to have as you have in your schools now teaching sex.

00:32:48.071 --> 00:32:50.080
What is there to teach I don’t understand, I mean.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:51.757
It is such a spontaneous thing.

00:32:51.958 --> 00:32:53.325
On the contrary, the more you talk about it,

00:32:53.526 --> 00:32:54.800
the worse it becomes, you see.

00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:57.680
And the more it becomes a brain thing,

00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:00.000
you cannot do sex with your brain, you see.

00:33:00.240 --> 00:33:01.920
So it’s all a nonsensical thing.

00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.880
All these things have added to your problems

00:33:05.080 --> 00:33:07.560
of impotency and all sorts of things in this country.

00:33:07.761 --> 00:33:09.144
Too much thinking about sex,

00:33:09.345 --> 00:33:11.344
at the time of sex you are nowhere, you are lost.

00:33:11.545 --> 00:33:13.960
So what’s the use of such a life, you see?

00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:16.440
So the people who think about sex too much

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:20.559
are really very unnatural people, they are very unnatural.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.000
To be natural is to keep it spontaneous,

00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:24.760
to live very spontaneously.

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.985
Of course, as an Indian lady, it is too much to speak on details

00:33:28.186 --> 00:33:30.240
but I would say that…

00:33:33.479 --> 00:33:37.439
And we are not supposed to even say the word “sex” in Indian life,

00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:39.240
you see, it’s like that, you see?

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:42.080
But I think we are very potent people.

00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:44.980
The amount of children we are producing, you can never produce

00:33:45.181 --> 00:33:46.600
even if you want to.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:34:00.039
So now the thing is that

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.324
as a Mother I give all sort of grace to these people,

00:34:04.525 --> 00:34:06.400
grace marks I should say,

00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.800
when they said that the sex can take you to Kundalini,

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.880
because you know, in the beginning

00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:14.280
they must have tried something like that

00:34:14.480 --> 00:34:17.486
and they must have seen

00:34:17.687 --> 00:34:22.498
the expression of the deity

00:34:22.698 --> 00:34:24.999
which has got a trunk, you see,

00:34:25.200 --> 00:34:26.942
which is settled on this center.

00:34:27.143 --> 00:34:28.345
We call it as Ganapati

00:34:28.546 --> 00:34:32.759
who actually incarnated as Christ on this earth, later on.

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:36.520
But He is the Ganapati. And there you see just a trunk

00:34:36.721 --> 00:34:38.331
and they must have misunderstood

00:34:38.531 --> 00:34:39.977
that this trunk is the Kundalini,

00:34:40.178 --> 00:34:42.080
because it has a shape like that.

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.004
And that’s why they might have said it,

00:34:44.205 --> 00:34:46.279
but it’s the most dangerous thing.

00:34:46.480 --> 00:34:47.678
If you go through sex,

00:34:47.879 --> 00:34:52.160
then you are open yourself absolutely to hell.

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.840
If you go towards sex and try to come to God,

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:58.120
it’s absolutely wrong, you see?

00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.560
Christ has gone to such a limit because Christ was born here

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.400
and He looks after our all optic lobes

00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:06.560
and all this part of the eyes.

00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:08.320
And what He said,

00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:11.480
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:13.320
Just see it!

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:17.360
What does that mean? That means you have innocent eyes.

00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:20.680
He was innocence. He was the embodiment of innocence.

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.760
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.360
No lust and no greed in your eyes.

00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:28.400
Now is only possible if Christ is awakened within you.

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:30.200
Once He is awakened within you,

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.280
then you will have your innocence

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:35.600
and you will also lose the lust from your eyes.

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:38.520
Eyes will be absolutely looking

00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:40.640
but not getting involved.

00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:42.880
That sort of a thing will happen to you.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:46.600
So the sex which is a normal thing to do

00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.000
has to be sanctified by collective people,

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:51.851
should be done in a proper way

00:35:52.051 --> 00:35:53.599
so that you get good children.

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.800
The marriage should be sanctified collectively

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:59.240
and should be done in a proper way

00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.890
and should be looked after.

00:36:01.091 --> 00:36:04.119
Because now, of course people are on a different line,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.960
but when I had come ten years back, when I told them,

00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:09.440
that you have to have sanity about sex,

00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.120
they were very angry and they said, “You are Victorian”.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.320
They called Me “Queen Victoria”.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.811
But now I think they have learnt a lesson

00:36:19.012 --> 00:36:21.596
because I had told them, I had told them

00:36:21.797 --> 00:36:25.040
that, “You will get a disease which you will not be able to work on.

00:36:25.320 --> 00:36:28.800
Don’t do all this nonsense of perversion. It’s very nonsensical.”

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.720
But even now they are trying to evade the issue.

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.320
Don’t try to evade the issue.

00:36:32.520 --> 00:36:34.240
You can be cured of that disease

00:36:34.480 --> 00:36:37.960
if you can awaken your innocence within yourself.

00:36:38.440 --> 00:36:41.879
Through the grace of Christ only you can do it.

00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.720
Mother, we have learned, heard that when,

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:49.680
when we learn love then we shall have will.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:53.480
What is the relationship between love and will?

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:58.120
SM: When we’ll have love, then we’ll have will.

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.120
Good! Love is when you become the Spirit,

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:04.560
because Spirit is nothing but God’s love.

00:37:04.800 --> 00:37:07.480
This All Pervading Power is Spirit.

00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.280
So when you know that love, which is not attachment,

00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:13.869
it’s not attachment, you see.

00:37:14.070 --> 00:37:17.719
Like a sap rises in the tree,

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.920
it goes even to the trunk,

00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:24.360
and then to the branches, to the leaves,

00:37:24.560 --> 00:37:26.520
to the flowers, to everyone.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.600
It doesn’t settle down into one flower.

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:32.560
If it does, then the flower dies and the tree also dies.

00:37:32.760 --> 00:37:36.280
So it is not attached, but it is nourishing.

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.520
It does what it has to do. That kind of a love,

00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:44.080
which is absolutely without any conditions, unconditional,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:47.280
without any lust, without any greed - that kind of a love -

00:37:47.481 --> 00:37:48.493
when you will know,

00:37:48.694 --> 00:37:52.640
that is only possible when you will become the Spirit.

00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.040
Then you will know the Will of God,

00:37:55.240 --> 00:37:57.320
the Will of God – what is to be done.

00:37:57.520 --> 00:37:59.839
Because you don’t know. Now you have to...

00:38:00.039 --> 00:38:02.559
Then when you get your Realization what happens?

00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:05.880
This cool breeze is like a computer working.

00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:09.680
You ask the computer, “Now, should I do this work?”

00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:12.120
If it is yes, you will have cool vibrations.

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:16.080
If not, no vibrations. So you will know His Will.

00:38:16.320 --> 00:38:19.040
"Thy Will be done", you see? How do you know His Will?

00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:21.640
Then you just know. You become the knowledge.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:24.760
When you become the knowledge, when you become the love,

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.433
then you become the knowledge also.

00:38:26.634 --> 00:38:27.995
Even in everyday life,

00:38:28.196 --> 00:38:31.720
if you love somebody, you know a lot about that person.

00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.565
B: Mother, this afternoon You said something very interesting

00:38:35.766 --> 00:38:38.360
in response to a question by a woman.

00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.760
And response You gave was that

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:45.601
“Service and sacrifice are a myth, or is a myth.”

00:38:46.080 --> 00:38:48.000
Can you describe what You meant by that?

00:38:48.200 --> 00:38:51.360
You see, when I said that, when you become a saint,

00:38:51.560 --> 00:38:53.680
in the sense when you become a realized soul,

00:38:53.880 --> 00:38:56.080
you find that you are collectively conscious.

00:38:56.280 --> 00:39:00.040
Then what happens, that if somebody has got a problem

00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.160
you feel it on your fingertips.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.560
Now you rub your fingertips and the person feels all right.

00:39:05.840 --> 00:39:08.680
Now you have done no service, you have done no sacrifice.

00:39:08.880 --> 00:39:10.680
It’s your finger that is in trouble.

00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.360
Now if you rub your finger, who is the other?

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:16.040
You see this comes out of ignorance and those…

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.538
In India actually, they knew it so well

00:39:18.738 --> 00:39:22.031
that those people who talked of sacrifice and service

00:39:22.232 --> 00:39:25.480
were called as Shudras, means untouchables.

00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.680
That means they had no knowledge about it.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:30.280
Those people who talked that, “We’ll serve you;

00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:33.137
we’ll do this dirty work of yours, that dirty work of yours” -

00:39:33.338 --> 00:39:34.532
they were called as Shudras.

00:39:34.732 --> 00:39:36.803
They are not the people who should be touched

00:39:37.004 --> 00:39:38.560
because they have no awareness

00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:43.307
that the All Pervading Power of God is there

00:39:43.508 --> 00:39:44.800
which does everything.

00:39:45.001 --> 00:39:47.080
What you have to do is to just become one with It.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:49.920
And once you are one with the whole Primordial Being,

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:53.040
say, on your body if there is a pain somewhere,

00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:55.880
you just rub it. All right, you rub it and it’s all right.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:57.440
There’s no obligation on it.

00:39:57.640 --> 00:39:59.200
In anyway you have not served anyone,

00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.640
you have not obliged anyone.

00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:05.360
So the concept that you are one with the Whole itself

00:40:05.560 --> 00:40:07.280
is the noble’s concept.

00:40:07.480 --> 00:40:09.440
And those people who do not have that concept

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:10.937
cannot understand. They think,

00:40:11.138 --> 00:40:13.840
“We are serving others; we are looking after others.”

00:40:14.040 --> 00:40:17.131
“Who is the other?” I asked them. “Who is the other?”

00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.800
That is why this is the concept

00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:22.640
with which Indians have always lived.

00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:24.360
And that’s something good they have.

00:40:24.560 --> 00:40:26.235
But they also picked up, you see,

00:40:26.436 --> 00:40:27.920
when your missionaries went there

00:40:28.121 --> 00:40:30.363
they also started their missions, this, that,

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:32.519
serving and serving and all that.

00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:35.640
Now to the poor people, now how do we serve?

00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:38.127
We serve in this way in Sahaja Yoga

00:40:38.328 --> 00:40:40.147
that once they get their Realization

00:40:40.348 --> 00:40:41.959
they don’t remain so poor at all.

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:43.488
You see, because first of all

00:40:43.689 --> 00:40:46.040
the poor people have bad habits of drinking;

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.600
all those things drop out.

00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:51.240
So all that money doesn’t go into nonsensical thing.

00:40:51.840 --> 00:40:54.200
Secondly, they get those vibrations.

00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.480
Now whatever work they are in, they become dynamic.

00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:00.200
They have no health problem.

00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.640
They don’t have to go to the doctors.

00:41:02.840 --> 00:41:04.240
They become healthy people.

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:06.280
Mentally they are so alert

00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:08.200
that they do better than any other.

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:11.520
We have seen people who came to Me and said that,

00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:14.040
“Our children are very bad at school.

00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.320
Must do something about them.”

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:17.400
When they got their Realization, now they stood first.

00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:19.480
They got all the scholarships, everything.

00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.771
They are doing so well.

00:41:20.972 --> 00:41:24.480
So, such people become also materially better off.

00:41:24.680 --> 00:41:27.280
They don’t become extraordinarily rich

00:41:27.480 --> 00:41:31.120
but they become materially well-off, satisfied people.

00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:34.080
You see, also dissatisfaction is another poverty,

00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:35.480
because you are dissatisfied.

00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:37.440
I think those are the greatest poor people

00:41:37.640 --> 00:41:39.172
because they are never satisfied.

00:41:39.372 --> 00:41:45.200
But the people who are realized souls, are satisfied souls.

00:41:45.400 --> 00:41:48.200
They know how to live well and they are helped.

00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:51.400
Like Krishna has said it, “Yoga kshema Vahamyaham”.

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.760
He said, “I’ll give you Kshema after Yoga.”

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:58.840
First He said “Yog.” And “Kshema” means your well-being.

00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:02.640
So well-being acts after Yoga, not before.

00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.708
Mother, in the West there is a great,

00:42:07.909 --> 00:42:11.040
especially I would say in this part of the West from the West Coast,

00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:15.680
there is a great interest in subjects such as Kabbalah,

00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.520
tarot, astrology, spiritual alchemy.

00:42:20.743 --> 00:42:24.434
How does Sahaja Yoga relate to this? What are Your views about this?

00:42:24.635 --> 00:42:26.640
I can’t understand. That means they are not seekers

00:42:26.840 --> 00:42:28.160
those who have such interest, you see,

00:42:28.361 --> 00:42:30.880
because these things relate to a material life.

00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:32.720
Mataji, how do they relate to a material life?

00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:35.840
SM: You see, because Kabbalah will tell you when will you get married,

00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:38.360
or how much money you’ll have, what race you’ll win,

00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.600
all those things, you see?

00:42:39.800 --> 00:42:41.440
God has no interest in these things, you see.

00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:44.760
All these things are, spiritual alchemy,

00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.067
how will you change this into gold...

00:42:48.268 --> 00:42:49.503
And what does it matter?

00:42:49.704 --> 00:42:52.679
Gold and all those things what are so important, isn’t it?

00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:57.880
The most important thing is to be your Spirit.

00:42:58.160 --> 00:43:00.770
And those who are seeking the Spirit are real seekers.

00:43:00.971 --> 00:43:03.600
All others are seeking money

00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.320
in some other form, you see,

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:07.349
and then when they go to these people actually

00:43:07.550 --> 00:43:08.640
these are nothing but spirits -

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:10.320
and they get possessed by spirits

00:43:10.520 --> 00:43:12.400
and they have horrible time, you see.

00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:14.360
One should never indulge into these things.

00:43:14.560 --> 00:43:17.759
Christ has warned the most of all and we are doing it.

00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:20.120
So often it’s very wrong to ask

00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:21.880
for anything material like that.

00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:24.240
Why should we have easy money like that?

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.800
It’s not good I think,

00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:27.800
through some spirit helping you or something.

00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:29.480
I don’t know if it really helps.

00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:32.240
It may little bit help but give you later trouble.

00:43:32.440 --> 00:43:36.680
Like one lady had a problem with her husband, you see?

00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:40.640
She said that, “He is a bad man; he’s a flirt and all that.”

00:43:40.841 --> 00:43:43.080
She went to such a woman and he became

00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.280
as far as she is concerned, he gave up flirting

00:43:45.480 --> 00:43:46.640
but he started racing.

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:50.107
And he got lost in racing. Then she went there and she said that,

00:43:50.308 --> 00:43:53.473
“Now he should be all right from this, He should get out.”

00:43:53.674 --> 00:43:54.967
So he started drinking.

00:43:55.168 --> 00:43:57.970
And after some time he started doing all the three things, you see.

00:43:58.171 --> 00:43:59.952
So it was too much.

00:44:00.153 --> 00:44:02.810
So this kind of a nonsense you should not indulge into

00:44:03.011 --> 00:44:04.080
if you are seekers.

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:06.400
But there are category of people who are seekers.

00:44:06.640 --> 00:44:09.650
That’s what I feel. And those who are seekers are getting into it

00:44:09.851 --> 00:44:12.920
should get out of it and get to your Spirit.

00:44:13.229 --> 00:44:15.373
What’s the role of the artist

00:44:15.587 --> 00:44:18.503
- in this work, this Sahaja Yoga?
- Who?

00:44:18.703 --> 00:44:21.920
An artist, artistic work like music…

00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:24.113
Oh, great, great! Tremendous it is!

00:44:24.314 --> 00:44:27.007
You see, those people who have been realized souls

00:44:27.208 --> 00:44:29.320
have created eternal art.

00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.200
Like we can say, Michelangelo was a realized soul.

00:44:33.400 --> 00:44:35.400
So his work is eternal art.

00:44:35.601 --> 00:44:38.200
They produce art which creates vibrations.

00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.040
You can feel vibrations from him.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:43.359
In the whole church if you go you feel horrid,

00:44:43.559 --> 00:44:46.199
but when you go to Sistine Chapel and see his work

00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.520
and the whole thing fills you up with vibrations.

00:44:48.720 --> 00:44:51.080
They are creators of vibrations. Imagine!

00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:52.840
The musicians like Mozart...

00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:56.120
Mozart creates vibrations but Wagner…

00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:03.360
You see, so they are the people who are realized souls.

00:45:03.560 --> 00:45:07.240
You have some tennis players who are realized souls also

00:45:07.440 --> 00:45:08.640
- perhaps you don't know.
- Tennis players?

00:45:08.840 --> 00:45:11.520
SM: Yes! McEnroe is a realized soul

00:45:11.721 --> 00:45:13.560
and Borg is also.

00:45:13.800 --> 00:45:17.560
And My grandchild told Me, “You know, why Borg has retired?

00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:20.240
Because another Sahaja Yogi has come now,

00:45:20.440 --> 00:45:22.399
the younger one, so give chance to him

00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:25.439
and that’s why he is very honorably retired”.

00:45:25.640 --> 00:45:28.040
Is because when McEnroe speaks, you must have seen,

00:45:28.240 --> 00:45:30.240
he tells himself “John, now behave yourself.”

00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.600
They are in the third person.

00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:34.640
And that’s why people don’t understand him

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.360
and he doesn’t like to be insulted.

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:39.200
And that’s very true. And anybody who is a saint

00:45:39.400 --> 00:45:40.880
doesn’t like him to be insulted.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:44.623
So like that you have so many people
who are realized souls, we can say.

00:45:44.824 --> 00:45:48.269
Even the Princess of Wales [Diana] is a realized soul

00:45:48.470 --> 00:45:50.120
and the new child is a realized soul.

00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:53.800
So there are so many people like that, who are realized souls.

00:45:54.760 --> 00:45:58.242
The listeners who will be tuning into this program on the radio,

00:45:58.443 --> 00:46:01.440
won’t have had the experience of being in Your presence.

00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:03.760
Some of them may have who were in this room.

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.760
What can you say to them about how to become a realized soul,

00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.400
how to achieve this cool breeze that comes from…

00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.402
At the beginning of My lecture,

00:46:13.603 --> 00:46:16.400
if you tell them that they should put their hands towards the radio,

00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:18.560
just on the radio,

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:20.360
they might feel the cool breeze.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.600
If they don’t feel it, then tell them to put the right hand first

00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:25.141
till they feel the cool breeze,

00:46:25.342 --> 00:46:27.439
and left hand up as if ventilating out.

00:46:27.640 --> 00:46:30.640
And then the left hand towards the radio

00:46:30.840 --> 00:46:32.040
and the right hand up.

00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:35.400
It might work out because it has worked in Hong Kong.

00:46:36.480 --> 00:46:38.053
I tell You it would be interesting.

00:46:38.254 --> 00:46:41.348
I interviewed Danny and Doug before You came

00:46:41.549 --> 00:46:44.080
so that listeners would have a chance to come here.

00:46:44.280 --> 00:46:45.633
And one of them called me

00:46:45.834 --> 00:46:48.128
and said that he went into a meditation in the afternoon

00:46:48.329 --> 00:46:51.160
and felt the cool breeze just by hearing them talk.

00:46:51.400 --> 00:46:53.497
SM: See, if Sahaja Yogis can do it

00:46:53.698 --> 00:46:56.760
then when I’m talking it should happen.

00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:04.120
We are about at the end of the interview

00:47:04.320 --> 00:47:06.840
and what I want to do now, Mother, is give You a chance

00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.200
to say what’s in Your heart to say.

00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:11.840
What is there that You wish to share

00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:14.360
has not been said this evening?

00:47:14.560 --> 00:47:18.240
SM: I have to say that America is a great country in the universe.

00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:21.960
It has the place of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:47:22.160 --> 00:47:27.164
which is the center of responsibility and discretion.

00:47:27.365 --> 00:47:30.439
And they have been so responsible so far.

00:47:30.640 --> 00:47:33.680
They have given such noble ideas of democracy

00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.594
and of freedom and all those things

00:47:36.795 --> 00:47:41.800
which are really all belonging to God’s ideas.

00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:44.160
And when they talk of all these things,

00:47:44.360 --> 00:47:47.876
we must know that there is something much more

00:47:48.077 --> 00:47:49.880
that they can give to the whole world.

00:47:50.080 --> 00:47:53.201
So many saints are born in this country because they realized

00:47:53.402 --> 00:47:55.519
that this is the country where they’ll be able

00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.360
to prosper better into their spirituality.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:01.800
So it is a very great responsibility of Americans

00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.800
to understand that we have had great leaders,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:06.680
we have had great noble ideals,

00:48:06.880 --> 00:48:08.880
we have had got great saints living here,

00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:11.680
so many are anxious to come down here.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.320
Only thing what we have to do

00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:16.160
is to establish within ourselves our Spirit,

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.123
and to be ready and prepared for this great, tremendous work

00:48:20.324 --> 00:48:21.760
that is going to come now.

00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:24.159
And this is what the world has to do.

00:48:24.360 --> 00:48:28.480
If emancipation of the humanity has to take place,

00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:32.880
it has to take place only from inside out and not outside in.

00:48:33.080 --> 00:48:34.608
Another thing I would like to tell

00:48:34.809 --> 00:48:38.120
that the danger is not from outside for America,

00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:41.520
not from anywhere else. It is from within themselves.

00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.520
So be careful. We have to be careful about ourselves

00:48:45.721 --> 00:48:47.060
the way we are destroying.

00:48:47.260 --> 00:48:48.757
When we say, “What’s wrong?”

00:48:48.958 --> 00:48:51.519
we go head long into our destructions.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.720
Human beings should not take freedom as abandonment,

00:48:54.920 --> 00:48:59.400
but freedom to enjoy completely and fully.

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.040
The freedom that takes you to a destruction is not freedom.

00:49:03.240 --> 00:49:05.520
And the right idea of freedom must be taken

00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:08.320
and people should know that freedom,

00:49:08.520 --> 00:49:12.280
ultimate freedom, is when you become your own master,

00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:15.879
when there are no habits,

00:49:16.080 --> 00:49:18.120
when you cannot be dominated by anything,

00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:21.560
you are above everything. That’s the freedom you have to achieve.

00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:22.830
And that is why

00:49:23.031 --> 00:49:25.760
people talked long time back in this country about freedom.

00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:28.360
They helped all the countries to get their freedom,

00:49:28.560 --> 00:49:30.085
and now it is their job

00:49:30.286 --> 00:49:34.160
to get them their own freedom within themselves

00:49:34.361 --> 00:49:36.040
so that others will also follow.

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.759
May God bless you all.

00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:39.840
Thank you, Mother.

00:49:40.074 --> 00:49:42.018
May God bless you.

00:49:49.876 --> 00:49:52.615
Good? All right.

00:50:13.375 --> 00:50:16.445
Now, that was really nice of her to give so much time.

00:50:16.646 --> 00:50:17.800
You see, it's important,

00:50:18.040 --> 00:50:21.320
because your medias are also for Sahaja Yoga only created.

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:23.120
Everything is for Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:25.094
They have to act for Sahaja Yoga only,

00:50:25.294 --> 00:50:27.251
because this has to spread everywhere.

00:50:27.452 --> 00:50:29.616
Christ could not have met the whole world, you see?

00:50:29.817 --> 00:50:31.880
But I can.

00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:45.400
So after all that, I want to announce something very good

00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:50.880
and excellent for you, a great news, that

00:50:51.840 --> 00:50:57.200
doctor Warren Reeves is going to be engaged to Ursula today.

00:50:57.800 --> 00:51:00.920
I hope you like it.

00:51:23.960 --> 00:51:26.680
What joy, eh? Creates joy!

00:51:27.240 --> 00:51:29.424
Such a great thing! It's a collective.

00:51:29.625 --> 00:51:32.320
Marriage has to be collective, then it is sustained.

00:51:32.520 --> 00:51:34.840
It has to be collective. Indians know this trick.

00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:37.400
You see, they have a collective marriage.

00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:39.360
Everything has to be in the marriage;

00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.873
even the reeves of the village, even the barber,

00:51:43.074 --> 00:51:45.682
even the washerman, everybody is to be there,

00:51:45.883 --> 00:51:47.640
has to work out something for the marriage.

00:51:47.840 --> 00:51:50.000
So the whole community is there to marry

00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.482
and that's how the marriage you see is there

00:51:52.683 --> 00:51:55.120
because everybody looks after you, you see?

00:51:55.320 --> 00:51:57.280
If there are many forces on one point

00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:59.280
then the point remains where it is.

00:51:59.480 --> 00:52:01.371
Doesn't shift, you see?

00:52:01.572 --> 00:52:03.840
So there is no shifting in marriage.

00:52:04.630 --> 00:52:07.734
Equal and opposite forces always acting on one point,

00:52:07.935 --> 00:52:09.745
you better be there.

00:52:10.560 --> 00:52:13.880
SY: Mataji, do we have to call him doctor Sellmayer?

00:52:15.544 --> 00:52:16.526
SM: What?

00:52:16.727 --> 00:52:18.920
SY: Do we have to call him doctor Sellmayer after this?

00:52:19.120 --> 00:52:21.394
SM: Doctor...?
SY: Doctor Sellmayer?

00:52:21.595 --> 00:52:24.880
SM: To Warren? Yes, yes, during the [unclear], [that's very bad].

00:52:25.081 --> 00:52:27.688
SY: Yes, we should definetely.

00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:33.412
It's a very good thing, great news for all of you, isn't it?

00:52:33.613 --> 00:52:36.083
SY: Yes. Yes, pretty good.

00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:39.520
SM: Now...

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:43.080
Should we have the question thing going on?

00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:46.040
Because Sahaja Yoga you have understood quite a lot I think.

00:52:46.240 --> 00:52:52.080
Have you? Because now in this Vishuddhi chakra of yours

00:52:52.280 --> 00:52:55.400
My Vishuddhi is working too much.

00:52:57.560 --> 00:53:01.560
It's a continuous everyday, continuously.

00:53:01.760 --> 00:53:03.120
And I am coming from Europe

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:07.367
where I had a very intensive programmes for 21 days

00:53:07.568 --> 00:53:10.800
and I stayed in London only for two days and third day I was here.

00:53:11.022 --> 00:53:14.062
Since that day My throat is really...

00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:17.000
First time I felt it.

00:53:17.320 --> 00:53:19.720
Now, if you have any questions you better ask,

00:53:19.920 --> 00:53:21.840
will be good idea.

00:53:23.178 --> 00:53:24.429
SY: Mother.
SM: Yes.

00:53:24.629 --> 00:53:25.858
SY: What is the difference

00:53:26.059 --> 00:53:28.978
between a self realized being and an enlightened being?

00:53:29.179 --> 00:53:30.158
SM: And?

00:53:30.358 --> 00:53:33.479
SY: Between a self realized being and an enlightened being?

00:53:33.680 --> 00:53:37.256
SM: Same, the same.

00:53:37.840 --> 00:53:40.405
SY: The same - an enlightened being and self realized being.

00:53:40.606 --> 00:53:44.000
SM: Oh, yes I heard it. So I think now

00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.052
his attention should not be so much on Me, isn't it?

00:53:59.560 --> 00:54:03.119
He should pay more attention to something else now.

00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:05.446
Dr. Warren: Then I'm not getting married, Mother.

00:54:05.647 --> 00:54:08.400
SM: Listen that! Very bad!

00:54:12.428 --> 00:54:15.840
Now, Self Realization and enlightenment is the same thing

00:54:16.040 --> 00:54:19.687
like you enlighten first a candle.

00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:22.199
So first you are very careful

00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.280
that it takes up the flame.

00:54:24.480 --> 00:54:26.360
Then you look after it very carefully,

00:54:26.560 --> 00:54:29.880
could keep your hand watching that it doesn't go out, you see.

00:54:30.081 --> 00:54:32.520
In the beginning, very important to see that

00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:34.960
it keeps its flame burning.

00:54:35.200 --> 00:54:36.880
And you do everything to keep it,

00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.605
because once it is out again it will be difficult to enlighten,

00:54:39.806 --> 00:54:40.840
so you do that.

00:54:41.040 --> 00:54:42.599
And that is what is

00:54:42.799 --> 00:54:45.079
what we call the awakening first time takes place

00:54:45.280 --> 00:54:46.760
and you have to establish it.

00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:49.760
Then you establish and once it is established

00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.880
then you go on enlarging your light

00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:55.800
and you see that you become the light.

00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.159
Spirit is the flame that is burning.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:01.760
All right?

00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.968
I think I left My watch somewhere in it...

00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:07.680
SY: Mother?
SM: Yes.

00:55:07.880 --> 00:55:09.909
SY: Could You say something more about the,

00:55:10.110 --> 00:55:13.280
something about negative forces? You mentioned that the other day.

00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:16.040
SM: Something about?
SY: About negative forces.

00:55:16.241 --> 00:55:17.866
SM: Negative? All right.

00:55:18.067 --> 00:55:20.400
SM: About all these spirits and...
