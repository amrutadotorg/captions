Kazu Radio Interview. Santa Cruz, California (USA), 1 October 1983.

00:07.734 --> 00:08.898
Beautiful!

00:09.099 --> 00:13.720
Bolo Shri Adi Shakti Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi ki! Jai!

00:20.080 --> 00:24.360
Who is the gentleman who met Me in Kamini Kadam's house?

00:27.120 --> 00:28.086
Are right there.

00:28.286 --> 00:31.562
Hello, how do you do? Very nice to meet you. Both of you were there?

00:31.763 --> 00:33.501
- Yes.
- All right. May God bless you.

00:33.702 --> 00:35.505
- How are you sleeping?
- Fine, thank You.

00:35.706 --> 00:39.229
May God bless you. Nice to meet you again.

00:41.680 --> 00:45.520
Mother, a lady from Kazu Radio

00:45.721 --> 00:48.480
actually who is coming as a seeker

00:48.719 --> 00:52.119
but has also arranged that, if an interview is possible.

00:52.327 --> 00:55.046
- All right.
- Barbara! This is Barbara.

00:55.247 --> 00:59.840
Yes. So today we should have questioning only will be good idea.

01:00.080 --> 01:02.280
All right?

01:09.800 --> 01:12.759
- Thank you, Mother.
- May God bless you.

01:12.960 --> 01:16.519
Before we begin, I would like to introduce myself

01:16.720 --> 01:18.848
to those of you in the room.

01:19.048 --> 01:22.787
My name is Barbara Schuler and I do a radio program

01:22.988 --> 01:27.014
on a station from Monterrey called Discovery

01:27.215 --> 01:31.640
which is usually on Wednesdays from 1 to 2:30,

01:31.840 --> 01:36.400
and is going to be now on Thursdays to 11:30 to 1 o’clock.

01:36.640 --> 01:39.080
And it’s my privilege to be here

01:39.280 --> 01:42.640
to do a taped interview for my listeners.

01:45.440 --> 01:47.550
So for the listeners I would like to say

01:47.751 --> 01:50.800
that we are at Kennolyn Campgrounds in Santa Cruz

01:51.000 --> 01:54.720
and this is an interview with Her Holiness Mataji.

01:55.200 --> 01:59.840
Mother, today there are many, many things said about Sahaja Yoga,

02:00.080 --> 02:01.680
about Your philosophy

02:01.880 --> 02:05.791
and very little was said about who You are as a person.

02:06.440 --> 02:08.840
And I thought it would be good to start out with some,

02:09.040 --> 02:12.440
few questions about who You are, who were You as a child,

02:12.640 --> 02:14.480
what people influenced You,

02:14.680 --> 02:17.040
what brought You to the place You are today

02:17.240 --> 02:21.400
as a Luminous Being sitting before me and before us?

02:21.880 --> 02:25.880
I am a very ancient being – that problem is like this, you see?

02:28.640 --> 02:31.880
And to… what can I tell you about Myself?

02:32.080 --> 02:35.120
I just don’t know what part will interest you,

02:35.917 --> 02:40.400
but only thing I can say

02:40.840 --> 02:46.359
that I was born with this understanding and awareness

02:46.560 --> 02:50.480
that I have to find out a method

02:51.120 --> 02:55.360
by which I could give en mass Realization to people.

02:55.960 --> 02:57.419
I was a Realized soul, of course.

02:57.620 --> 03:01.249
I knew all about it from My very childhood.

03:01.471 --> 03:06.911
But the problem was that how to make many people get it,

03:07.112 --> 03:09.439
because if one person gets it

03:09.640 --> 03:11.680
or one person has it,

03:11.880 --> 03:14.040
if one person is an incarnation,

03:14.240 --> 03:16.520
people don’t understand it.

03:16.720 --> 03:20.799
Not only that but they may even try to destroy such a person.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.840
That’s what happened to all the saints who came on this earth.

03:24.040 --> 03:25.840
Christ was crucified,

03:26.040 --> 03:28.028
Mohammed Sahib was given poison.

03:28.229 --> 03:29.999
Because they were ignorant.

03:30.200 --> 03:33.840
They did not know what it was, what was He saying.

03:34.560 --> 03:36.900
So it was important first of all

03:37.101 --> 03:41.119
to find out a method how to give them

03:41.320 --> 03:44.280
en mass Realization.

03:44.760 --> 03:48.220
And from that angle I just thought

03:48.421 --> 03:50.863
that this is why I am on this earth

03:51.070 --> 03:53.359
and I have to do this job,

03:53.560 --> 03:57.280
for which I wanted to study about human beings.

03:57.680 --> 04:00.840
I took My birth in a Christian family

04:01.080 --> 04:04.640
and that too a family which was Protestant family,

04:04.840 --> 04:07.800
because I felt that

04:08.800 --> 04:12.120
Protestants are fanatics but very sophisticated.

04:15.680 --> 04:18.320
And they rationalize everything to such an extent

04:18.520 --> 04:20.640
that nobody can see beyond it.

04:20.840 --> 04:23.840
So I better take My birth in them.

04:24.079 --> 04:26.959
And My father and mother had already taken birth

04:27.160 --> 04:29.920
whom I had chosen as My parents.

04:30.200 --> 04:33.520
They were great people, realized souls

04:33.720 --> 04:35.960
and specially My father

04:36.160 --> 04:39.160
was a person who knew why I was on this earth.

04:39.400 --> 04:42.280
Even My mother knew about it.

04:43.360 --> 04:47.359
So a special rapport was between them and Me

04:47.560 --> 04:49.929
and they could understand

04:50.130 --> 04:53.592
why I was busy meditating

04:53.793 --> 04:58.240
or finding out about how to give Realization to others.

04:58.520 --> 05:01.480
Then I would say My father who was a very learned man,

05:01.760 --> 05:03.960
who knew about fourteen languages,

05:04.160 --> 05:06.640
who translated Quran-e-Sharif into Hindi,

05:06.880 --> 05:09.760
who was a member of the Constituent Assembly,

05:09.960 --> 05:11.478
He made our Constitution.

05:11.679 --> 05:16.360
Also he was the only Christian to be elected in those days.

05:16.680 --> 05:20.720
And then My mother was a honors in Mathematics,

05:20.920 --> 05:25.000
all very well-educated and nice people.

05:25.280 --> 05:27.360
They dedicated their life

05:27.560 --> 05:30.360
to the cause of freedom of India.

05:30.600 --> 05:33.320
And I also felt that, that was very important,

05:33.521 --> 05:36.160
because if we are not free

05:36.400 --> 05:38.880
we cannot do anything on religious basis.

05:39.080 --> 05:42.160
There’s one thing is to be free from this level.

05:42.400 --> 05:47.280
And that’s how I also helped them a lot

05:47.481 --> 05:49.518
and our whole family suffered a lot.

05:49.719 --> 05:52.575
And I went through terrible times, terrible times,

05:52.776 --> 05:54.279
since very young age.

05:54.480 --> 05:56.334
I was with Mahatma Gandhi also

05:56.535 --> 05:58.747
because he liked Me very much as a child.

05:58.948 --> 06:00.173
So I stayed on with him

06:00.374 --> 06:03.359
then I used to come back to study, again go back to him.

06:03.560 --> 06:05.040
He used to call Me “Nepali”

06:05.240 --> 06:07.680
because My face is a Nepali face.

06:08.160 --> 06:09.520
And he used to talk to Me

06:09.720 --> 06:11.760
as if he is talking to his grandmother sometimes.

06:11.960 --> 06:14.560
He was very sweet and he was a very sweet man

06:14.760 --> 06:17.000
– extremely sweet person to children -

06:17.240 --> 06:21.600
very strict with himself and strict with others elderly people.

06:21.800 --> 06:26.400
But with children he was very, very sweet and kind

06:27.520 --> 06:31.400
and would try to learn from children lot of things.

06:31.600 --> 06:33.680
It was surprising how he understood

06:33.880 --> 06:37.160
that there’s lot of wisdom with the children sometimes

06:37.360 --> 06:42.006
than with the older people who are mixed up.

06:44.160 --> 06:47.119
Now we got our independence

06:47.320 --> 06:50.510
and we had a very bad setback

06:50.711 --> 06:55.200
because of the partition we had in our country.

06:55.960 --> 06:59.080
And I was studying in Lahore Medical College there

06:59.280 --> 07:01.960
because I wanted to know about medicine

07:02.160 --> 07:05.063
what these people call such and such thing,

07:05.264 --> 07:07.800
because I knew all this but, I knew about the body,

07:08.000 --> 07:10.280
I knew about everything, the

07:10.560 --> 07:13.120
what you call the complete nervous system

07:13.320 --> 07:16.200
but I did not know what was the vocabulary attached to it,

07:16.400 --> 07:18.319
so I studied there for two years.

07:18.520 --> 07:20.960
Now after that, this war broke out,

07:21.160 --> 07:23.280
so I had to discontinue with My studies

07:23.480 --> 07:25.760
and My parents wanted Me to get married.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.917
And then I found that My marriage was important,

07:30.118 --> 07:31.321
I agreed to marry

07:31.522 --> 07:35.225
and I married this gentleman, Mr. C.P. Srivastava.

07:35.520 --> 07:38.435
Then during all that time,

07:38.636 --> 07:43.383
My only pastime or the full-time work

07:43.583 --> 07:45.406
was to find out about human beings,

07:45.607 --> 07:47.280
what’s the problem they have,

07:47.480 --> 07:50.880
how they avoid reality,

07:51.160 --> 07:53.760
how they shun it, how they run away from it,

07:53.960 --> 07:55.680
what are their problems,

07:55.880 --> 08:01.039
how are they seeking, what do they have to offer,

08:01.240 --> 08:03.680
what will they accept, how to handle them.

08:03.880 --> 08:05.440
It was quite a intricate question.

08:05.640 --> 08:09.760
Every person provided a new sample of problems

08:09.960 --> 08:11.690
and I had to fight it out.

08:11.891 --> 08:16.071
In a way that it was a system which I knew how to do it,

08:16.272 --> 08:19.476
because to enter into somebody subtly,

08:19.677 --> 08:22.000
to understand the problems of the Kundalini –

08:22.201 --> 08:26.967
you can go into the journey and find out about a person.

08:27.280 --> 08:28.384
And then I found out

08:28.585 --> 08:31.880
the permutations and combinations of their problems.

08:32.080 --> 08:35.480
So like, it is like, you can say, that, like periodic tables.

08:35.680 --> 08:38.880
You had to divide them into three, then into seven,

08:39.080 --> 08:41.160
then into their permutations and combinations.

08:41.400 --> 08:44.760
So you can imagine - three into seven, raised to power eternity.

08:45.000 --> 08:46.181
It was like that.

08:46.382 --> 08:49.880
But doesn’t matter! It worked out and

08:51.240 --> 08:55.990
in the year 1970,

08:56.191 --> 08:58.399
on the 5th of May,

08:58.600 --> 09:02.120
I was little bit hesitant at that time.

09:02.320 --> 09:04.748
I thought I should wait but certain circumstances

09:04.949 --> 09:09.839
made Me to open the last center.

09:10.080 --> 09:13.035
And when I opened the last center,

09:13.568 --> 09:17.168
it started working with others, it went on en mass scale.

09:17.400 --> 09:20.760
But still I gave Realization only to

09:21.000 --> 09:22.920
one lady who came to My house.

09:23.160 --> 09:26.080
I tried if it works out with her.

09:26.280 --> 09:28.850
And she, I gave her Realization,

09:29.051 --> 09:32.252
by touching her centers one by one

09:32.453 --> 09:33.599
- six centers -

09:33.800 --> 09:36.480
and then bringing out the Kundalini on top of the head.

09:36.680 --> 09:40.200
What does it mean to open the last center?
SM: The Sahasrara?

09:40.400 --> 09:44.320
Last center is the center which is the limbic area;

09:45.560 --> 09:48.240
where is the seat of all the seven centers.

09:48.480 --> 09:50.120
It’s all integration there.

09:50.320 --> 09:52.200
So far, everybody who has come

09:52.400 --> 09:54.000
- like Christ has come on this center,

09:54.200 --> 09:55.880
what you call the Agnya Chakra,

09:56.080 --> 09:59.519
or Krishna has come on this center which is the Vishuddhi Chakra.

09:59.720 --> 10:04.439
Like that they have been appearing on every center of ours

10:04.640 --> 10:07.720
giving us a new dimension to our awareness.

10:07.960 --> 10:11.520
And that’s how our awareness has improved to this extent

10:11.719 --> 10:15.879
and now the time is for you to get your Absolute,

10:16.080 --> 10:19.279
to get your Spirit,

10:19.480 --> 10:23.320
that your Spirit must shine into your attention,

10:23.560 --> 10:29.080
that you should have your Self-Realization,

10:29.280 --> 10:31.560
that you should have your second birth.

10:31.800 --> 10:35.800
That’s the time! And that is only possible if baptism,

10:36.000 --> 10:39.120
the real baptism works out – real, not artificial,

10:39.320 --> 10:42.120
somebody coming and putting the hand on your head and saying,

10:42.320 --> 10:44.600
“Now you are baptized”.  That’s not the way.

10:44.800 --> 10:47.789
But it is a real thing that happens that you start feeling

10:47.990 --> 10:51.200
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming out of you.

10:52.376 --> 10:57.320
So then I started giving first of all Realization

10:57.520 --> 11:00.880
without confronting any kind of a position or anything.

11:01.080 --> 11:04.720
I started with one lady, then I went ahead with it.

11:04.920 --> 11:07.640
Then the first twelve people got Realization.

11:07.840 --> 11:09.120
Then I was very happy

11:09.320 --> 11:12.000
because en mass Realization has started.

11:12.280 --> 11:15.040
Then gradually it started working out.

11:15.240 --> 11:17.400
I went to Indian villages.

11:17.600 --> 11:19.280
I thought they are better, simple people,

11:19.480 --> 11:22.600
first work on the simpler people. And they got Realization.

11:22.800 --> 11:25.680
Now we have thousands of people in the villages

11:25.920 --> 11:27.600
who have got Realization.

11:27.800 --> 11:29.640
They have dropped out all their bad habits.

11:29.840 --> 11:31.680
They have become very creative.

11:31.880 --> 11:34.800
They are doing very well. They are very happy people.

11:35.000 --> 11:36.284
And they are experts.

11:36.484 --> 11:39.512
So many of them are experts I can say in India now,

11:39.713 --> 11:41.319
whom we call as Sahaja Yogi,

11:41.520 --> 11:42.960
may be in thousands.

11:43.160 --> 11:44.713
Some are working in the villages,

11:44.913 --> 11:46.759
some are working in some cities.

11:46.960 --> 11:50.640
So we have lots of people now in India, who can do this job.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.359
This all happened since 1970?

11:53.559 --> 11:55.679
- I started it.
- [So You started]...

11:55.880 --> 11:59.560
I have a question that’s important to me

11:59.799 --> 12:04.711
and to many people who are searching for something as they think,

12:04.912 --> 12:07.200
perhaps what you call Self Realization

12:07.400 --> 12:10.760
or Sahaja Yoga or something.

12:10.960 --> 12:13.265
We, some of us don’t know exactly what it is.

12:13.466 --> 12:16.119
And we find that there are many teachers.

12:16.320 --> 12:19.040
How do we recognize those teachers

12:19.240 --> 12:22.480
that You might call fraudulent from the real ones?

12:22.680 --> 12:25.920
It’s so difficult because they all seem to be able to

12:26.120 --> 12:28.920
inspire us in certain ways and give us experiences.

12:29.160 --> 12:33.121
How do we know who is teaching something that’s true

12:33.322 --> 12:35.680
and who is being deceptive?

12:35.880 --> 12:37.440
SM: First and foremost thing is:

12:37.640 --> 12:42.040
anybody who lives on your earnings is not a guru.

12:42.800 --> 12:47.240
A guru will never live on the earnings of his disciples.

12:47.568 --> 12:50.088
But here there are people who have big palaces,

12:50.320 --> 12:53.840
bought aircrafts and cars and this.

12:54.040 --> 12:55.902
I mean, this is something one should understand.

12:56.103 --> 13:00.760
It’s so, so open to you to understand.

13:00.960 --> 13:05.873
I mean, I cannot understand more obvious thing that this one is

13:06.074 --> 13:07.600
that it’s a parasitic living.

13:07.800 --> 13:10.400
And you cannot have a parasites as your gurus.

13:10.600 --> 13:13.080
They can be parasites but not your gurus.

13:13.280 --> 13:16.040
That’s one of the things. And if you can…

13:17.160 --> 13:19.680
I mean, you can retain some people, you know?

13:19.880 --> 13:22.520
If you want because you are rich people, you can retain some.

13:22.720 --> 13:25.520
That’s a different point. But you cannot have them as gurus.

13:25.720 --> 13:28.839
Guru has to be a higher personality, you see?

13:29.040 --> 13:33.520
Now you have seen Christ was such a great incarnation.

13:33.796 --> 13:35.720
He didn’t take any money from anyone.

13:35.920 --> 13:39.261
He was a carpenter’s son and He used to do carpentry Himself

13:39.462 --> 13:41.160
and He lived like a modest man.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.465
He never lived with big cars and big houses. It’s not necessary

13:45.666 --> 13:49.346
because such a person is Himself, He is a very big king, you see,

13:49.547 --> 13:51.600
like a big emperor.

13:51.840 --> 13:54.477
He doesn’t need anything, an emperor doesn’t need anything

13:54.678 --> 13:57.421
because nothing can give him comfort

13:57.622 --> 14:00.240
except that He Himself is in complete comfort.

14:00.480 --> 14:02.680
So such a person doesn’t want anything.

14:02.880 --> 14:07.080
So you must see that such a person has no needs of comfort at all.

14:07.320 --> 14:10.920
He can sleep on the grounds, he can sleep anywhere.

14:11.120 --> 14:13.000
Now, in this life,

14:13.200 --> 14:16.440
I should say I come from a quite a wealthy family

14:16.640 --> 14:19.893
or married to another wealthy man, you can say that way,

14:20.094 --> 14:22.960
according to your own relative ideas.

14:23.160 --> 14:26.322
But to Me,

14:26.523 --> 14:28.640
I can sleep anywhere. I have no problem.

14:28.840 --> 14:30.120
I have no problem of food,

14:30.320 --> 14:32.960
no problem of sleeping anywhere, no comfort.

14:33.160 --> 14:36.640
And I find it is beyond My self-respect

14:36.840 --> 14:39.520
to live on the earnings of others. It’s not proper.

14:39.720 --> 14:40.898
But you are My children;

14:41.099 --> 14:44.383
supposing now you bring a flower to Me or something, it’s all right.

14:44.584 --> 14:48.063
But I can’t have a palace out of your money and all those things.

14:48.264 --> 14:49.840
It’s absurd, absolutely absurd!

14:50.041 --> 14:53.840
So this is one thing one should know that it pampers our ego,

14:54.040 --> 14:56.120
that we can purchase our guru,

14:56.320 --> 14:58.440
we can purchase our Self-Realization.

14:58.640 --> 15:01.720
You see, this is a very subtle pampering.

15:01.960 --> 15:03.760
And that’s how people accept, you see?

15:03.960 --> 15:07.240
They don’t want to accept a person who says,

15:07.480 --> 15:10.040
“You cannot offer anything.”  It’s too much for them.

15:10.280 --> 15:14.858
Or maybe that, secondly, could be that people think

15:15.059 --> 15:18.839
that if you pay something then you get attached to it,

15:19.039 --> 15:20.734
you go through it whatever it is.

15:20.935 --> 15:23.139
Say you have paid for a ticket

15:23.340 --> 15:26.186
and you find that the whole play is horrid, you can’t bear it,

15:26.387 --> 15:28.774
but you have to go through it because you have paid for it.

15:28.975 --> 15:30.359
That’s a human nature, you see?

15:30.560 --> 15:32.720
That’s a human nature. I have seen that they do it.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.720
And that’s what it works out.

15:34.920 --> 15:37.040
But this is very gross level, I’m telling you.

15:37.240 --> 15:41.014
But another should be that in these modern times it is promised

15:41.215 --> 15:43.680
that you will become prophets.

15:44.600 --> 15:46.440
You have to become prophets.

15:46.640 --> 15:50.040
So you must see have you become prophets out of these?

15:50.240 --> 15:53.880
Is... easiest is to see the disciples of this man,

15:54.080 --> 15:56.080
any XYZ who says he is a guru.

15:56.320 --> 15:59.520
Now what is happening to the disciple? Is he a free person?

15:59.760 --> 16:01.520
Has he got any knowledge?

16:01.720 --> 16:03.560
Has he got any mastery?

16:03.800 --> 16:05.748
What has he achieved by being with that person?

16:05.949 --> 16:07.849
Now, you have seen here there are Sahaja Yogis.

16:08.050 --> 16:09.129
One better than the other!

16:09.330 --> 16:11.920
You talk to them, they are knowledge.

16:13.106 --> 16:15.885
Some of them have met Me only for, say, eight day or so.

16:16.086 --> 16:17.519
They have become knowledge.

16:17.720 --> 16:19.480
So what have they achieved you should say.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.485
What is their style of life, their pattern of life, how they behave?

16:23.686 --> 16:26.030
And there cannot be any privacy about it,

16:26.231 --> 16:27.480
you see, like mafia -

16:27.680 --> 16:29.960
you don’t tell that and you don’t say that

16:30.160 --> 16:31.360
and you shouldn’t do that.

16:31.560 --> 16:33.520
Of course, in Sahaja Yoga

16:33.920 --> 16:36.480
the truth is exposed gradually,

16:36.680 --> 16:40.461
but it is not like this that if you give some money, nobody knows.

16:40.662 --> 16:43.180
Everybody knows everything in Sahaja Yoga, you see?

16:43.381 --> 16:47.186
Now supposing we have to build an ashram, say for example.

16:47.387 --> 16:49.681
All right, you build your ashram, you collect your money,

16:49.882 --> 16:52.514
do what you like and know about it. I have nothing to do with it.

16:52.715 --> 16:55.040
Also among yourself you should know how you got the money,

16:55.240 --> 16:57.920
how you spent it, what is the expense and all that.

16:58.120 --> 17:00.703
Because ashram you can pay for

17:00.904 --> 17:03.320
but not for your Realization.

17:03.838 --> 17:06.959
And this is one thing is very important,

17:07.160 --> 17:09.600
that what you get out of it is important,

17:09.800 --> 17:12.440
that you should become a prophet.

17:13.000 --> 17:15.200
Have you become a prophet?

17:15.440 --> 17:18.680
Then, thirdly, you must know that if
you are going from one to another,

17:18.880 --> 17:20.320
what we call guru shopping business

17:20.560 --> 17:21.960
that means you have not found it.

17:22.160 --> 17:23.960
Otherwise, you would just settle down.

17:24.160 --> 17:27.360
But some people are so weak that they do settle down with one

17:27.560 --> 17:29.400
and are finished with them.

17:29.680 --> 17:31.320
You must always see the people

17:31.520 --> 17:34.279
who go to these gurus, what have they got.

17:34.480 --> 17:37.880
Have they got their transformation?

17:39.023 --> 17:41.880
Because this is the age of transformation.

17:42.080 --> 17:46.280
Mataji, what about teachers or gurus who produce miracles?

17:46.480 --> 17:48.642
You go to a guru

17:48.843 --> 17:51.919
who materialize something out of the air and say, “This is divine”.

17:52.120 --> 17:53.506
That’s a very serious question.

17:53.707 --> 17:55.199
This is all jugglery. It’s all jugglery.

17:55.400 --> 17:57.800
And also, you see, now supposing somebody says,

17:58.000 --> 17:59.600
“I produce a diamond”.

17:59.800 --> 18:01.240
Now these people come from India.

18:01.440 --> 18:05.320
Why don’t they solve the financial problem of India?

18:10.080 --> 18:13.039
Secondly, you see, at every point they can be challenged.

18:13.240 --> 18:15.040
You should say that, "Then, all right"...

18:15.240 --> 18:17.809
One gentleman came to Me; he said that, “He gave me a diamond.”

18:18.010 --> 18:19.813
I said, “Why you? How many diamonds you have?”

18:20.014 --> 18:22.057
He has said, “Hundreds.” Then I said, “Why did he give you?

18:22.258 --> 18:24.720
He should give to your driver who hasn’t got a diamond”.

18:24.920 --> 18:28.160
You see, that is what it is. So it is all jugglery.

18:28.360 --> 18:31.120
You should see those who materialize,

18:31.400 --> 18:33.240
what have they given you?

18:33.440 --> 18:35.720
They have to give you something eternal.

18:36.000 --> 18:37.360
If they talk about God,

18:37.560 --> 18:39.120
God is not going to give you diamond.

18:39.320 --> 18:41.160
Which God has given diamonds to people?

18:41.360 --> 18:44.600
Have you heard of anyone giving diamonds? No!

18:45.800 --> 18:49.600
So you should ask for something which is the highest,

18:49.800 --> 18:51.840
which is the supreme most.

18:52.080 --> 18:55.600
Now the fourth thing, which is very important,

18:56.240 --> 18:59.040
that whatever experiences you get -

18:59.240 --> 19:01.640
for example, some people start just like jumping,

19:01.880 --> 19:05.000
some start shouting, some start behaving like animals.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.440
And they say, “Oh, that’s what is coming out.

19:07.640 --> 19:08.800
You are taking out, you see.”

19:09.000 --> 19:12.200
They feel very bad, they get horrible diseases,

19:12.400 --> 19:14.840
they get into troubles and they get into pains

19:15.040 --> 19:17.040
and all sorts of things and contortions.

19:17.240 --> 19:19.560
They say, “Now, your subconscious is coming out”.

19:19.760 --> 19:22.920
Nothing has to be brought out. That’s one thing you must know.

19:23.120 --> 19:26.000
The subconscious, as I told you, is on the left hand side

19:26.200 --> 19:28.680
and the supraconscious on the right hand side.

19:28.880 --> 19:33.400
What you have to do is to ascend in the center and come up.

19:33.600 --> 19:36.439
Above your head is the super-consciousness

19:36.640 --> 19:38.400
and when you become that,

19:38.600 --> 19:41.240
then you develop collective consciousness.

19:41.440 --> 19:45.200
So those who want you to become like frogs again,

19:45.440 --> 19:49.283
you must know that you are not going to become frogs anymore.

19:49.640 --> 19:52.280
That’s not anyway evolution.

19:52.480 --> 19:55.120
The evolution has to go higher,

19:55.320 --> 19:58.200
not becoming frogs or earthworms, you see?

19:58.400 --> 20:01.760
And if you start crawling, it is simple mesmerism.

20:01.960 --> 20:05.040
Anybody mesmerizes can do these tricks, you see?

20:05.240 --> 20:06.600
It’s simple mesmerism.

20:06.800 --> 20:09.992
And then to believe that now you are surrendered and all that

20:10.193 --> 20:11.720
is all nonsense, you see?

20:11.920 --> 20:15.240
It has no meaning to Realization.

20:15.480 --> 20:17.880
In Realization, you just become the master.

20:18.080 --> 20:20.040
You become the master of it.

20:20.240 --> 20:23.280
There are many people in this country who came

20:23.680 --> 20:26.360
and lured you by their talks also,

20:26.560 --> 20:31.640
talking big about Brahma, Atmatattva, this, that and everything.

20:31.840 --> 20:33.125
That is not the way you can,

20:33.325 --> 20:36.345
that is what is just the pendulum moving

20:36.546 --> 20:39.209
from Christian sermon to Hindu sermon

20:39.410 --> 20:41.879
and from Hindu sermon to Islamic sermon,

20:42.079 --> 20:44.158
from there to the Rabbi sermon.

20:44.359 --> 20:47.120
You see, it goes on like that, you see? That’s not the way.

20:47.320 --> 20:49.440
You have to rise higher within yourself.

20:49.640 --> 20:51.920
And that’s why those who lecture about these things

20:52.120 --> 20:54.960
are really sometimes can be very, very dangerous.

20:55.160 --> 20:58.520
And so many have died of cancer, this, that.

20:58.720 --> 21:01.400
I don’t know what to say that people who go to these people

21:01.600 --> 21:04.520
get into very bad troubles and suffer so much.

21:04.720 --> 21:07.040
And then on top of that when all this happens,

21:07.240 --> 21:09.440
they say, “You must suffer.”

21:10.640 --> 21:12.480
That’s a very good excuse, “You must suffer”.

21:12.681 --> 21:14.320
You must pay to suffer.

21:14.760 --> 21:17.160
Pay money to suffer.

21:18.000 --> 21:19.640
And then people go on suffering.

21:19.840 --> 21:23.200
Now one thing I have to tell you that Christ has suffered for us.

21:23.400 --> 21:25.000
We don’t have to suffer anymore.

21:25.200 --> 21:28.600
Those who deny His sufferings, will have to go for suffering.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.360
All right, have it! But He suffered for us.

21:31.560 --> 21:34.040
There is no need for us to suffer anymore.

21:34.280 --> 21:36.200
When He is awakened within us,

21:36.400 --> 21:39.560
He takes away all that is our ego means our karmas,

21:39.760 --> 21:43.280
our superego, that is our conditioning, completely removed,

21:43.480 --> 21:45.680
and you become one with the Divine.

21:45.880 --> 21:48.120
There is no need for anybody to suffer

21:48.320 --> 21:51.040
and this idea of suffering is all nonsensical.

21:51.240 --> 21:54.040
You should not suffer at all.

21:54.520 --> 21:56.400
Good!

21:57.480 --> 21:59.320
I’m glad it’s over.

22:03.112 --> 22:05.712
- Mataji, You are called “Mother”.
- Yes.

22:05.960 --> 22:08.000
It seems that in Hindu tradition

22:08.200 --> 22:12.908
there is a special context or meaning of the word “Mother”.

22:13.108 --> 22:14.446
What is this meaning?

22:14.647 --> 22:18.831
You see, in the Indian philosophy,

22:19.032 --> 22:21.517
even in the Christian philosophy it is so,

22:21.718 --> 22:24.080
but it has been little bit changed -

22:24.280 --> 22:26.880
if you read the books of Essenes, you will find

22:27.080 --> 22:28.800
that they have described the “Mother”,

22:29.000 --> 22:30.680
you see, the Holy Ghost is the Mother.

22:30.880 --> 22:33.122
When they say about the Holy Ghost, She is the Mother.

22:33.323 --> 22:35.663
But how can you have… You must reason it out.

22:35.880 --> 22:38.160
How can you have a Father and a Son without a Mother?

22:38.360 --> 22:40.720
It’s a, you see, simple thing like that.

22:40.920 --> 22:44.320
You see, so it’s the Mother only. Holy Ghost is very important.

22:44.520 --> 22:45.994
So Holy Ghost is the Mother.

22:46.194 --> 22:48.691
You see, it's an absurd thing, I mean, to have such a thing.

22:48.892 --> 22:51.160
Even homosexuals cannot have children.

22:51.360 --> 22:53.480
It’s funny thing, isn’t it? Absolutely absurd!

22:53.680 --> 22:56.160
But Christians accepted this, I don’t know why.

22:56.360 --> 22:58.160
Why didn’t they go into, find out

22:58.360 --> 23:00.040
what is this Holy Ghost business is?

23:00.240 --> 23:02.720
They said, “It’s a mystery”. How can you say it’s a mystery?

23:02.960 --> 23:06.080
When you cannot explain then better not say anything about it.

23:06.280 --> 23:08.280
So Holy Ghost is something hanging in the air.

23:08.480 --> 23:10.160
No one knows; it’s a mystery

23:10.361 --> 23:13.040
and the rest of it is the Father and the Son. It’s absurd!

23:13.240 --> 23:18.038
Now the principle of Mother is in every, every Scripture,

23:18.239 --> 23:19.520
has to be there.

23:19.720 --> 23:22.120
Now the Mother’s character is that

23:22.320 --> 23:25.920
She is the One Who is the Womb,

23:26.440 --> 23:28.840
She is the One Who is the Mother Earth

23:29.080 --> 23:31.400
and She is the One Who nourishes you.

23:31.600 --> 23:33.720
She nourishes us, you know that.

23:33.920 --> 23:38.200
And this feminine thing in every human being

23:38.400 --> 23:40.680
resides as this Kundalini as you have seen.

23:40.880 --> 23:44.160
And when She rises, She gives you this new awareness

23:44.400 --> 23:47.640
which becomes compassion, which is flowing,

23:47.840 --> 23:55.559
which becomes soothing, nourishing energy of love.

23:55.760 --> 23:58.200
And that’s what today people are saying feminist -

23:58.400 --> 24:00.440
all this thing and all that. That’s again a pendulum

24:00.640 --> 24:02.720
- a man becoming a woman, woman becoming man -

24:02.920 --> 24:05.160
all these problems you have had because of this.

24:05.361 --> 24:09.039
But when you move spirally upward,

24:09.240 --> 24:12.040
then where do you move you become

24:12.280 --> 24:17.480
a personality full of compassion, of love,

24:17.760 --> 24:21.320
of universal understanding,

24:21.760 --> 24:23.680
through collective consciousness.

24:23.880 --> 24:26.040
And then you rise up to a position

24:26.240 --> 24:28.879
where you become universally conscious.

24:29.080 --> 24:31.133
So that is what should happen to you.

24:31.334 --> 24:34.201
And if that happens, then we should say

24:34.402 --> 24:37.840
that your motherly qualities within you have risen.

24:38.120 --> 24:40.400
And that’s what we have so far neglected.

24:40.640 --> 24:43.920
You do not become a woman but you become motherly.

24:44.240 --> 24:48.840
First the Father, then the Son and now the Mother! All right?

24:49.040 --> 24:52.120
What is the role of woman in this world,

24:52.320 --> 24:54.560
the role of the feminine principle?

24:55.360 --> 24:57.496
I would say, I don’t say that women

24:57.697 --> 25:00.320
as women who are born as women only have the role,

25:00.520 --> 25:02.586
even the men have, everyone has,

25:02.787 --> 25:04.959
because everyone has Kundalini within them.

25:05.160 --> 25:07.760
But the women must know that if they are women,

25:07.960 --> 25:10.160
they have a greater responsibility.

25:10.400 --> 25:13.120
Not that they should sit at home and only look after children

25:13.320 --> 25:16.960
and brood and then nag the husbands when they come home.

25:19.383 --> 25:20.806
That’s not their role.

25:21.007 --> 25:25.240
The role is such that they have to be forbearing.

25:25.480 --> 25:27.760
Any person who is the mother

25:27.960 --> 25:30.280
has to be like the Mother Earth.

25:30.480 --> 25:33.240
How much She is forbearing! How much She suffers!

25:33.480 --> 25:36.920
We dig Her out, we torture Her life

25:37.120 --> 25:39.400
still She is giving all the time;

25:39.600 --> 25:42.560
She is soothing, forgiving, bearing it out, you see.

25:42.880 --> 25:44.840
Then we are doing so many sinful things,

25:45.040 --> 25:47.800
I mean, She should explode real with anger, the way it is.

25:48.000 --> 25:50.120
But She does not, She is very careful,

25:50.320 --> 25:51.960
She slowly, slowly informs that,

25:52.200 --> 25:55.479
“Now get out of this place, it’s rumbling”.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.760
She is so kind, you see? That all should come to us.

25:58.960 --> 26:01.080
So it’s not that it is only the women

26:01.280 --> 26:03.280
who should settle down with these qualities,

26:03.480 --> 26:06.000
but the time has come that men have to have these qualities.

26:06.200 --> 26:08.320
Otherwise, there will be always an imbalance.

26:08.520 --> 26:10.558
So now the men have to become

26:10.759 --> 26:14.240
extremely kind, affectionate, compassionate.

26:14.440 --> 26:16.440
Give up that competitive spirit,

26:16.640 --> 26:19.160
that fighting spirit like Napoleon had.

26:19.400 --> 26:21.160
All those ideas are outdated.

26:21.360 --> 26:24.800
Now whom do you respect? People like Mahatma Gandhi

26:25.120 --> 26:27.080
or Abraham Lincoln.

26:27.440 --> 26:31.360
Everyone...an American should think of Abraham Lincoln.

26:31.560 --> 26:33.840
Yes, indeed.

26:34.440 --> 26:36.440
Mother, what are we doing here?

26:36.640 --> 26:38.400
What is the purpose of life on earth?

26:38.640 --> 26:42.240
What are human beings walking around on this planet for?

26:42.680 --> 26:44.284
You are specially made by God.

26:44.484 --> 26:47.783
You are specially chosen by God to be human beings

26:47.984 --> 26:50.520
and you are here with a very great purpose.

26:50.720 --> 26:52.456
The first purpose of God

26:52.657 --> 26:57.209
is that you should become the vehicle of God’s powers,

26:57.409 --> 26:58.588
completely.

26:58.789 --> 27:00.880
So that He flows through you,

27:01.080 --> 27:05.040
He flows into this atmosphere,

27:05.240 --> 27:08.000
into this universe, to make it a divine place.

27:08.200 --> 27:11.040
If you, when you get Realization, what happens?

27:11.240 --> 27:14.320
These – all your abnormalities drop out

27:14.520 --> 27:16.680
and you become very normal person

27:16.880 --> 27:20.280
and these vibrations of cool breeze start flowing.

27:20.480 --> 27:22.640
With this now you can give it to Mother Earth,

27:22.840 --> 27:25.240
you can give it to the plants, you can give it to the trees.

27:25.440 --> 27:29.960
The whole thing becomes a “Garden of Allah”,

27:30.160 --> 27:32.880
where you reside in complete joy and happiness.

27:33.080 --> 27:34.624
The second purpose is,

27:34.825 --> 27:36.895
that God has prepared you now,

27:37.095 --> 27:38.959
to settle into His Kingdom.

27:39.160 --> 27:42.640
That’s your throne. That’s your right to be there.

27:42.880 --> 27:44.520
It could have been short circuited

27:44.720 --> 27:47.760
at a time when Adam and Eve were called

27:47.960 --> 27:52.000
and told not to go into this so-called “book of knowledge”

27:52.200 --> 27:54.000
or the “fruit of knowledge”.

27:54.200 --> 27:55.406
But they didn’t listen.

27:55.607 --> 27:58.068
You see, f you give freedom to someone then, “What’s wrong?”

27:58.269 --> 28:01.640
So they started doing things which were brought to them

28:01.880 --> 28:04.320
by a satanic force and they accepted it.

28:04.560 --> 28:06.880
So that was the original sin we have committed.

28:07.080 --> 28:09.960
So they had to take incarnations, do all those things

28:10.160 --> 28:12.120
and now brought it to this level

28:12.320 --> 28:16.274
where human beings have to be brought again back

28:16.475 --> 28:19.247
to the position where they were to go.

28:20.840 --> 28:23.760
Mother, what is the true nature of death?

28:23.960 --> 28:26.640
Is it possible that you can choose not to die?

28:26.840 --> 28:28.959
What’s the purpose of death?

28:29.160 --> 28:32.679
You see, death is just like changing your clothes.

28:32.880 --> 28:36.720
So sometimes when you use too much of your clothes, get tired,

28:36.920 --> 28:39.029
you want to change it. Like that death is.

28:39.230 --> 28:41.504
Nobody dies, there’s nothing that dies

28:41.705 --> 28:44.273
except that the part that is the Mother Earth

28:44.474 --> 28:48.429
and the part that is the water falls off

28:48.629 --> 28:50.359
and you remain as you are.

28:50.560 --> 28:52.920
But if you are a realized soul, then you have a choice.

28:53.120 --> 28:56.079
If you want to be born again, you would like to reborn.

28:56.279 --> 28:58.839
If you don’t want to be born, you will not be born.

28:59.040 --> 29:02.600
But after Realization, it becomes your choice.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.440
If you want to die, you can die.

29:04.640 --> 29:07.348
If you don’t want to die, you need not die.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.840
But you want, because you think that,

29:12.320 --> 29:16.600
“Let us die and come back as new people

29:16.800 --> 29:18.800
again to help Mother.”

29:20.000 --> 29:23.000
Many of us have heard discussions or read in books

29:23.200 --> 29:27.560
about the evolution of matter, the evolution of the substance.

29:28.360 --> 29:31.360
What are Your views on evolving matter

29:31.560 --> 29:34.400
and how does this relate to our own physical matter

29:34.640 --> 29:36.480
in our bodies or cells?

29:36.680 --> 29:39.520
So the matter did go into evolution, you know that,

29:39.720 --> 29:42.080
and when the carbon was established,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.200
actually our first chakra was established.

29:44.400 --> 29:46.800
That’s carbon which is tetravalent and

29:47.000 --> 29:50.120
carbon is the one which started producing amino acids.

29:50.320 --> 29:55.280
You see, when amino acid started manifesting itself this...

29:55.480 --> 29:59.639
then the other processes took place by which the evolution

29:59.840 --> 30:04.880
of, say from amoeba to human stage took place.

30:05.080 --> 30:08.640
That also we understand very well after getting Realization,

30:08.880 --> 30:11.960
how we became from amoeba to human stage;

30:12.160 --> 30:17.963
and after human stage we have to achieve our Self Realization,

30:18.164 --> 30:21.697
means the Spirit which is in our heart,

30:21.898 --> 30:24.000
has to manifest in our attention,

30:24.200 --> 30:26.800
or we have to feel it on central nervous system.

30:27.000 --> 30:30.000
But what is the relationship between matter and this?

30:30.200 --> 30:32.320
We should see that point. It’s important.

30:32.520 --> 30:35.800
Now through the matter all our centers are made.

30:36.000 --> 30:38.420
For example, the two centers that are down below

30:38.621 --> 30:41.960
are made of the Mother Earth principle.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.840
And then another one and another one like that.

30:45.080 --> 30:49.400
All these elements have contributed to make the centers.

30:49.640 --> 30:52.600
And these centers are just like mirrors made

30:52.800 --> 30:56.440
and the reflection of the Divine falls on them.

30:56.640 --> 31:00.680
Then at a human level the matter improves so much,

31:00.880 --> 31:03.139
goes into such evolutionary processes,

31:03.340 --> 31:07.600
that the reflection at the heart level improves so much

31:07.800 --> 31:09.398
that the Spirit shines there,

31:09.599 --> 31:14.360
and the Kundalini is properly set for your evolution,

31:14.600 --> 31:16.440
which is the epitome of evolution.

31:16.640 --> 31:19.280
Like this instrument that is made one by one,

31:19.480 --> 31:21.560
first collecting this part, that part, that part,

31:21.760 --> 31:22.836
then put together.

31:23.037 --> 31:26.040
Now the time has come for you to be put to the mains.

31:26.240 --> 31:29.120
Now this has nothing to do with the electricity, if you see.

31:29.360 --> 31:32.560
It exists without electricity but it can carry the electricity.

31:32.760 --> 31:34.680
In the same way, we become the lamp,

31:34.880 --> 31:37.920
and when we become the lamp the light can be brought in

31:38.120 --> 31:39.800
and we become enlightened.

31:40.000 --> 31:44.320
So there is a big relationship between the lamp and the light.

31:44.520 --> 31:47.480
But light cannot exist without the lamp,

31:47.680 --> 31:49.879
so lamp has to be there.

31:50.080 --> 31:52.280
Mother, can I ask you a question about sex?

31:52.480 --> 31:54.480
Yes, please.

31:56.600 --> 32:00.104
It was stated today that sex has nothing to do with evolution

32:00.305 --> 32:02.279
the way it’s been described in Sahaja Yoga.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.880
What does this mean?

32:04.080 --> 32:07.320
You see the thing is that we think that by doing sex

32:07.520 --> 32:09.560
or by going into sex we can evolve.

32:09.760 --> 32:11.320
It’s absolutely falsehood.

32:11.520 --> 32:15.764
You have not become a human being from amoeba to this stage

32:15.965 --> 32:17.033
by doing sex.

32:17.234 --> 32:19.640
Because animals all do sex, everybody does sex.

32:19.840 --> 32:21.920
If they do it or not, makes no difference!

32:22.120 --> 32:24.973
The thing is the evolution takes place

32:25.174 --> 32:26.471
only through your seeking.

32:26.672 --> 32:30.920
When you start seeking something, then only you evolve.

32:31.120 --> 32:33.058
And the seeking first was for food,

32:33.259 --> 32:35.078
if you see in the animals was for food, you see.

32:35.279 --> 32:36.520
Sex was spontaneous.

32:36.720 --> 32:38.960
They don’t think about it; they don’t read about it;

32:39.160 --> 32:41.560
they don’t have any education about it – nothing.

32:41.761 --> 32:44.801
Sex comes all spontaneously, just like your breathing, you see.

32:45.002 --> 32:47.870
You don’t have to have as you have in your schools now teaching sex.

32:48.071 --> 32:50.080
What is there to teach I don’t understand, I mean.

32:50.280 --> 32:51.757
It is such a spontaneous thing.

32:51.958 --> 32:53.325
On the contrary, the more you talk about it,

32:53.526 --> 32:54.800
the worse it becomes, you see.

32:55.000 --> 32:57.680
And the more it becomes a brain thing,

32:57.880 --> 33:00.000
you cannot do sex with your brain, you see.

33:00.240 --> 33:01.920
So it’s all a nonsensical thing.

33:02.120 --> 33:04.880
All these things have added to your problems

33:05.080 --> 33:07.560
of impotency and all sorts of things in this country.

33:07.761 --> 33:09.144
Too much thinking about sex,

33:09.345 --> 33:11.344
at the time of sex you are nowhere, you are lost.

33:11.545 --> 33:13.960
So what’s the use of such a life, you see?

33:14.160 --> 33:16.440
So the people who think about sex too much

33:16.640 --> 33:20.559
are really very unnatural people, they are very unnatural.

33:20.760 --> 33:23.000
To be natural is to keep it spontaneous,

33:23.200 --> 33:24.760
to live very spontaneously.

33:24.960 --> 33:27.985
Of course, as an Indian lady, it is too much to speak on details

33:28.186 --> 33:30.240
but I would say that…

33:33.479 --> 33:37.439
And we are not supposed to even say the word “sex” in Indian life,

33:37.640 --> 33:39.240
you see, it’s like that, you see?

33:39.480 --> 33:42.080
But I think we are very potent people.

33:42.280 --> 33:44.980
The amount of children we are producing, you can never produce

33:45.181 --> 33:46.600
even if you want to.

33:56.680 --> 34:00.039
So now the thing is that

34:00.240 --> 34:04.324
as a Mother I give all sort of grace to these people,

34:04.525 --> 34:06.400
grace marks I should say,

34:06.600 --> 34:09.800
when they said that the sex can take you to Kundalini,

34:10.040 --> 34:11.880
because you know, in the beginning

34:12.080 --> 34:14.280
they must have tried something like that

34:14.480 --> 34:17.486
and they must have seen

34:17.687 --> 34:22.498
the expression of the deity

34:22.698 --> 34:24.999
which has got a trunk, you see,

34:25.200 --> 34:26.942
which is settled on this center.

34:27.143 --> 34:28.345
We call it as Ganapati

34:28.546 --> 34:32.759
who actually incarnated as Christ on this earth, later on.

34:32.960 --> 34:36.520
But He is the Ganapati. And there you see just a trunk

34:36.721 --> 34:38.331
and they must have misunderstood

34:38.531 --> 34:39.977
that this trunk is the Kundalini,

34:40.178 --> 34:42.080
because it has a shape like that.

34:42.280 --> 34:44.004
And that’s why they might have said it,

34:44.205 --> 34:46.279
but it’s the most dangerous thing.

34:46.480 --> 34:47.678
If you go through sex,

34:47.879 --> 34:52.160
then you are open yourself absolutely to hell.

34:52.360 --> 34:55.840
If you go towards sex and try to come to God,

34:56.080 --> 34:58.120
it’s absolutely wrong, you see?

34:58.320 --> 35:01.560
Christ has gone to such a limit because Christ was born here

35:01.760 --> 35:04.400
and He looks after our all optic lobes

35:04.600 --> 35:06.560
and all this part of the eyes.

35:06.760 --> 35:08.320
And what He said,

35:08.520 --> 35:11.480
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

35:11.680 --> 35:13.320
Just see it!

35:14.160 --> 35:17.360
What does that mean? That means you have innocent eyes.

35:17.560 --> 35:20.680
He was innocence. He was the embodiment of innocence.

35:20.880 --> 35:22.760
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”

35:22.960 --> 35:25.360
No lust and no greed in your eyes.

35:25.560 --> 35:28.400
Now is only possible if Christ is awakened within you.

35:28.600 --> 35:30.200
Once He is awakened within you,

35:30.400 --> 35:32.280
then you will have your innocence

35:32.480 --> 35:35.600
and you will also lose the lust from your eyes.

35:35.800 --> 35:38.520
Eyes will be absolutely looking

35:38.720 --> 35:40.640
but not getting involved.

35:40.840 --> 35:42.880
That sort of a thing will happen to you.

35:43.080 --> 35:46.600
So the sex which is a normal thing to do

35:46.800 --> 35:50.000
has to be sanctified by collective people,

35:50.200 --> 35:51.851
should be done in a proper way

35:52.051 --> 35:53.599
so that you get good children.

35:53.800 --> 35:56.800
The marriage should be sanctified collectively

35:57.000 --> 35:59.240
and should be done in a proper way

35:59.440 --> 36:00.890
and should be looked after.

36:01.091 --> 36:04.119
Because now, of course people are on a different line,

36:04.320 --> 36:06.960
but when I had come ten years back, when I told them,

36:07.160 --> 36:09.440
that you have to have sanity about sex,

36:09.640 --> 36:12.120
they were very angry and they said, “You are Victorian”.

36:12.320 --> 36:15.320
They called Me “Queen Victoria”.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.811
But now I think they have learnt a lesson

36:19.012 --> 36:21.596
because I had told them, I had told them

36:21.797 --> 36:25.040
that, “You will get a disease which you will not be able to work on.

36:25.320 --> 36:28.800
Don’t do all this nonsense of perversion. It’s very nonsensical.”

36:29.000 --> 36:30.720
But even now they are trying to evade the issue.

36:30.960 --> 36:32.320
Don’t try to evade the issue.

36:32.520 --> 36:34.240
You can be cured of that disease

36:34.480 --> 36:37.960
if you can awaken your innocence within yourself.

36:38.440 --> 36:41.879
Through the grace of Christ only you can do it.

36:42.080 --> 36:45.720
Mother, we have learned, heard that when,

36:45.920 --> 36:49.680
when we learn love then we shall have will.

36:49.880 --> 36:53.480
What is the relationship between love and will?

36:54.200 --> 36:58.120
SM: When we’ll have love, then we’ll have will.

36:58.480 --> 37:02.120
Good! Love is when you become the Spirit,

37:02.320 --> 37:04.560
because Spirit is nothing but God’s love.

37:04.800 --> 37:07.480
This All Pervading Power is Spirit.

37:07.680 --> 37:12.280
So when you know that love, which is not attachment,

37:12.560 --> 37:13.869
it’s not attachment, you see.

37:14.070 --> 37:17.719
Like a sap rises in the tree,

37:17.920 --> 37:21.920
it goes even to the trunk,

37:22.120 --> 37:24.360
and then to the branches, to the leaves,

37:24.560 --> 37:26.520
to the flowers, to everyone.

37:26.720 --> 37:28.600
It doesn’t settle down into one flower.

37:28.800 --> 37:32.560
If it does, then the flower dies and the tree also dies.

37:32.760 --> 37:36.280
So it is not attached, but it is nourishing.

37:36.480 --> 37:39.520
It does what it has to do. That kind of a love,

37:39.720 --> 37:44.080
which is absolutely without any conditions, unconditional,

37:44.280 --> 37:47.280
without any lust, without any greed - that kind of a love -

37:47.481 --> 37:48.493
when you will know,

37:48.694 --> 37:52.640
that is only possible when you will become the Spirit.

37:52.840 --> 37:55.040
Then you will know the Will of God,

37:55.240 --> 37:57.320
the Will of God – what is to be done.

37:57.520 --> 37:59.839
Because you don’t know. Now you have to...

38:00.039 --> 38:02.559
Then when you get your Realization what happens?

38:02.760 --> 38:05.880
This cool breeze is like a computer working.

38:06.080 --> 38:09.680
You ask the computer, “Now, should I do this work?”

38:09.880 --> 38:12.120
If it is yes, you will have cool vibrations.

38:12.320 --> 38:16.080
If not, no vibrations. So you will know His Will.

38:16.320 --> 38:19.040
"Thy Will be done", you see? How do you know His Will?

38:19.240 --> 38:21.640
Then you just know. You become the knowledge.

38:21.840 --> 38:24.760
When you become the knowledge, when you become the love,

38:24.960 --> 38:26.433
then you become the knowledge also.

38:26.634 --> 38:27.995
Even in everyday life,

38:28.196 --> 38:31.720
if you love somebody, you know a lot about that person.

38:33.000 --> 38:35.565
B: Mother, this afternoon You said something very interesting

38:35.766 --> 38:38.360
in response to a question by a woman.

38:38.560 --> 38:40.760
And response You gave was that

38:40.960 --> 38:45.601
“Service and sacrifice are a myth, or is a myth.”

38:46.080 --> 38:48.000
Can you describe what You meant by that?

38:48.200 --> 38:51.360
You see, when I said that, when you become a saint,

38:51.560 --> 38:53.680
in the sense when you become a realized soul,

38:53.880 --> 38:56.080
you find that you are collectively conscious.

38:56.280 --> 39:00.040
Then what happens, that if somebody has got a problem

39:00.240 --> 39:02.160
you feel it on your fingertips.

39:02.360 --> 39:05.560
Now you rub your fingertips and the person feels all right.

39:05.840 --> 39:08.680
Now you have done no service, you have done no sacrifice.

39:08.880 --> 39:10.680
It’s your finger that is in trouble.

39:10.880 --> 39:13.360
Now if you rub your finger, who is the other?

39:13.560 --> 39:16.040
You see this comes out of ignorance and those…

39:16.280 --> 39:18.538
In India actually, they knew it so well

39:18.738 --> 39:22.031
that those people who talked of sacrifice and service

39:22.232 --> 39:25.480
were called as Shudras, means untouchables.

39:25.720 --> 39:27.680
That means they had no knowledge about it.

39:27.880 --> 39:30.280
Those people who talked that, “We’ll serve you;

39:30.480 --> 39:33.137
we’ll do this dirty work of yours, that dirty work of yours” -

39:33.338 --> 39:34.532
they were called as Shudras.

39:34.732 --> 39:36.803
They are not the people who should be touched

39:37.004 --> 39:38.560
because they have no awareness

39:38.800 --> 39:43.307
that the All Pervading Power of God is there

39:43.508 --> 39:44.800
which does everything.

39:45.001 --> 39:47.080
What you have to do is to just become one with It.

39:47.280 --> 39:49.920
And once you are one with the whole Primordial Being,

39:50.160 --> 39:53.040
say, on your body if there is a pain somewhere,

39:53.240 --> 39:55.880
you just rub it. All right, you rub it and it’s all right.

39:56.080 --> 39:57.440
There’s no obligation on it.

39:57.640 --> 39:59.200
In anyway you have not served anyone,

39:59.400 --> 40:00.640
you have not obliged anyone.

40:00.840 --> 40:05.360
So the concept that you are one with the Whole itself

40:05.560 --> 40:07.280
is the noble’s concept.

40:07.480 --> 40:09.440
And those people who do not have that concept

40:09.640 --> 40:10.937
cannot understand. They think,

40:11.138 --> 40:13.840
“We are serving others; we are looking after others.”

40:14.040 --> 40:17.131
“Who is the other?” I asked them. “Who is the other?”

40:18.720 --> 40:20.800
That is why this is the concept

40:21.000 --> 40:22.640
with which Indians have always lived.

40:22.840 --> 40:24.360
And that’s something good they have.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.235
But they also picked up, you see,

40:26.436 --> 40:27.920
when your missionaries went there

40:28.121 --> 40:30.363
they also started their missions, this, that,

40:30.570 --> 40:32.519
serving and serving and all that.

40:32.720 --> 40:35.640
Now to the poor people, now how do we serve?

40:36.240 --> 40:38.127
We serve in this way in Sahaja Yoga

40:38.328 --> 40:40.147
that once they get their Realization

40:40.348 --> 40:41.959
they don’t remain so poor at all.

40:42.160 --> 40:43.488
You see, because first of all

40:43.689 --> 40:46.040
the poor people have bad habits of drinking;

40:46.240 --> 40:47.600
all those things drop out.

40:47.800 --> 40:51.240
So all that money doesn’t go into nonsensical thing.

40:51.840 --> 40:54.200
Secondly, they get those vibrations.

40:54.400 --> 40:58.480
Now whatever work they are in, they become dynamic.

40:58.800 --> 41:00.200
They have no health problem.

41:00.400 --> 41:02.640
They don’t have to go to the doctors.

41:02.840 --> 41:04.240
They become healthy people.

41:04.480 --> 41:06.280
Mentally they are so alert

41:06.480 --> 41:08.200
that they do better than any other.

41:08.400 --> 41:11.520
We have seen people who came to Me and said that,

41:11.720 --> 41:14.040
“Our children are very bad at school.

41:14.240 --> 41:15.320
Must do something about them.”

41:15.520 --> 41:17.400
When they got their Realization, now they stood first.

41:17.600 --> 41:19.480
They got all the scholarships, everything.

41:19.680 --> 41:20.771
They are doing so well.

41:20.972 --> 41:24.480
So, such people become also materially better off.

41:24.680 --> 41:27.280
They don’t become extraordinarily rich

41:27.480 --> 41:31.120
but they become materially well-off, satisfied people.

41:31.320 --> 41:34.080
You see, also dissatisfaction is another poverty,

41:34.320 --> 41:35.480
because you are dissatisfied.

41:35.720 --> 41:37.440
I think those are the greatest poor people

41:37.640 --> 41:39.172
because they are never satisfied.

41:39.372 --> 41:45.200
But the people who are realized souls, are satisfied souls.

41:45.400 --> 41:48.200
They know how to live well and they are helped.

41:48.400 --> 41:51.400
Like Krishna has said it, “Yoga kshema Vahamyaham”.

41:51.640 --> 41:54.760
He said, “I’ll give you Kshema after Yoga.”

41:54.960 --> 41:58.840
First He said “Yog.” And “Kshema” means your well-being.

41:59.040 --> 42:02.640
So well-being acts after Yoga, not before.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.708
Mother, in the West there is a great,

42:07.909 --> 42:11.040
especially I would say in this part of the West from the West Coast,

42:11.240 --> 42:15.680
there is a great interest in subjects such as Kabbalah,

42:15.880 --> 42:20.520
tarot, astrology, spiritual alchemy.

42:20.743 --> 42:24.434
How does Sahaja Yoga relate to this? What are Your views about this?

42:24.635 --> 42:26.640
I can’t understand. That means they are not seekers

42:26.840 --> 42:28.160
those who have such interest, you see,

42:28.361 --> 42:30.880
because these things relate to a material life.

42:31.080 --> 42:32.720
Mataji, how do they relate to a material life?

42:32.920 --> 42:35.840
SM: You see, because Kabbalah will tell you when will you get married,

42:36.040 --> 42:38.360
or how much money you’ll have, what race you’ll win,

42:38.560 --> 42:39.600
all those things, you see?

42:39.800 --> 42:41.440
God has no interest in these things, you see.

42:41.640 --> 42:44.760
All these things are, spiritual alchemy,

42:44.960 --> 42:48.067
how will you change this into gold...

42:48.268 --> 42:49.503
And what does it matter?

42:49.704 --> 42:52.679
Gold and all those things what are so important, isn’t it?

42:52.880 --> 42:57.880
The most important thing is to be your Spirit.

42:58.160 --> 43:00.770
And those who are seeking the Spirit are real seekers.

43:00.971 --> 43:03.600
All others are seeking money

43:03.800 --> 43:05.320
in some other form, you see,

43:05.520 --> 43:07.349
and then when they go to these people actually

43:07.550 --> 43:08.640
these are nothing but spirits -

43:08.840 --> 43:10.320
and they get possessed by spirits

43:10.520 --> 43:12.400
and they have horrible time, you see.

43:12.640 --> 43:14.360
One should never indulge into these things.

43:14.560 --> 43:17.759
Christ has warned the most of all and we are doing it.

43:17.960 --> 43:20.120
So often it’s very wrong to ask

43:20.320 --> 43:21.880
for anything material like that.

43:22.080 --> 43:24.240
Why should we have easy money like that?

43:24.440 --> 43:25.800
It’s not good I think,

43:26.000 --> 43:27.800
through some spirit helping you or something.

43:28.000 --> 43:29.480
I don’t know if it really helps.

43:29.680 --> 43:32.240
It may little bit help but give you later trouble.

43:32.440 --> 43:36.680
Like one lady had a problem with her husband, you see?

43:36.880 --> 43:40.640
She said that, “He is a bad man; he’s a flirt and all that.”

43:40.841 --> 43:43.080
She went to such a woman and he became

43:43.280 --> 43:45.280
as far as she is concerned, he gave up flirting

43:45.480 --> 43:46.640
but he started racing.

43:46.840 --> 43:50.107
And he got lost in racing. Then she went there and she said that,

43:50.308 --> 43:53.473
“Now he should be all right from this, He should get out.”

43:53.674 --> 43:54.967
So he started drinking.

43:55.168 --> 43:57.970
And after some time he started doing all the three things, you see.

43:58.171 --> 43:59.952
So it was too much.

44:00.153 --> 44:02.810
So this kind of a nonsense you should not indulge into

44:03.011 --> 44:04.080
if you are seekers.

44:04.280 --> 44:06.400
But there are category of people who are seekers.

44:06.640 --> 44:09.650
That’s what I feel. And those who are seekers are getting into it

44:09.851 --> 44:12.920
should get out of it and get to your Spirit.

44:13.229 --> 44:15.373
What’s the role of the artist

44:15.587 --> 44:18.503
- in this work, this Sahaja Yoga?
- Who?

44:18.703 --> 44:21.920
An artist, artistic work like music…

44:22.120 --> 44:24.113
Oh, great, great! Tremendous it is!

44:24.314 --> 44:27.007
You see, those people who have been realized souls

44:27.208 --> 44:29.320
have created eternal art.

44:29.600 --> 44:33.200
Like we can say, Michelangelo was a realized soul.

44:33.400 --> 44:35.400
So his work is eternal art.

44:35.601 --> 44:38.200
They produce art which creates vibrations.

44:38.400 --> 44:40.040
You can feel vibrations from him.

44:40.240 --> 44:43.359
In the whole church if you go you feel horrid,

44:43.559 --> 44:46.199
but when you go to Sistine Chapel and see his work

44:46.400 --> 44:48.520
and the whole thing fills you up with vibrations.

44:48.720 --> 44:51.080
They are creators of vibrations. Imagine!

44:51.280 --> 44:52.840
The musicians like Mozart...

44:53.040 --> 44:56.120
Mozart creates vibrations but Wagner…

44:59.720 --> 45:03.360
You see, so they are the people who are realized souls.

45:03.560 --> 45:07.240
You have some tennis players who are realized souls also

45:07.440 --> 45:08.640
- perhaps you don't know.
- Tennis players?

45:08.840 --> 45:11.520
SM: Yes! McEnroe is a realized soul

45:11.721 --> 45:13.560
and Borg is also.

45:13.800 --> 45:17.560
And My grandchild told Me, “You know, why Borg has retired?

45:17.760 --> 45:20.240
Because another Sahaja Yogi has come now,

45:20.440 --> 45:22.399
the younger one, so give chance to him

45:22.599 --> 45:25.439
and that’s why he is very honorably retired”.

45:25.640 --> 45:28.040
Is because when McEnroe speaks, you must have seen,

45:28.240 --> 45:30.240
he tells himself “John, now behave yourself.”

45:30.440 --> 45:32.600
They are in the third person.

45:32.800 --> 45:34.640
And that’s why people don’t understand him

45:34.880 --> 45:36.360
and he doesn’t like to be insulted.

45:36.560 --> 45:39.200
And that’s very true. And anybody who is a saint

45:39.400 --> 45:40.880
doesn’t like him to be insulted.

45:41.080 --> 45:44.623
So like that you have so many people
who are realized souls, we can say.

45:44.824 --> 45:48.269
Even the Princess of Wales [Diana] is a realized soul

45:48.470 --> 45:50.120
and the new child is a realized soul.

45:50.320 --> 45:53.800
So there are so many people like that, who are realized souls.

45:54.760 --> 45:58.242
The listeners who will be tuning into this program on the radio,

45:58.443 --> 46:01.440
won’t have had the experience of being in Your presence.

46:01.640 --> 46:03.760
Some of them may have who were in this room.

46:03.960 --> 46:07.760
What can you say to them about how to become a realized soul,

46:07.960 --> 46:11.400
how to achieve this cool breeze that comes from…

46:11.640 --> 46:13.402
At the beginning of My lecture,

46:13.603 --> 46:16.400
if you tell them that they should put their hands towards the radio,

46:16.600 --> 46:18.560
just on the radio,

46:18.800 --> 46:20.360
they might feel the cool breeze.

46:20.560 --> 46:23.600
If they don’t feel it, then tell them to put the right hand first

46:23.800 --> 46:25.141
till they feel the cool breeze,

46:25.342 --> 46:27.439
and left hand up as if ventilating out.

46:27.640 --> 46:30.640
And then the left hand towards the radio

46:30.840 --> 46:32.040
and the right hand up.

46:32.240 --> 46:35.400
It might work out because it has worked in Hong Kong.

46:36.480 --> 46:38.053
I tell You it would be interesting.

46:38.254 --> 46:41.348
I interviewed Danny and Doug before You came

46:41.549 --> 46:44.080
so that listeners would have a chance to come here.

46:44.280 --> 46:45.633
And one of them called me

46:45.834 --> 46:48.128
and said that he went into a meditation in the afternoon

46:48.329 --> 46:51.160
and felt the cool breeze just by hearing them talk.

46:51.400 --> 46:53.497
SM: See, if Sahaja Yogis can do it

46:53.698 --> 46:56.760
then when I’m talking it should happen.

47:01.440 --> 47:04.120
We are about at the end of the interview

47:04.320 --> 47:06.840
and what I want to do now, Mother, is give You a chance

47:07.040 --> 47:09.200
to say what’s in Your heart to say.

47:09.400 --> 47:11.840
What is there that You wish to share

47:12.080 --> 47:14.360
has not been said this evening?

47:14.560 --> 47:18.240
SM: I have to say that America is a great country in the universe.

47:18.440 --> 47:21.960
It has the place of the Vishuddhi Chakra,

47:22.160 --> 47:27.164
which is the center of responsibility and discretion.

47:27.365 --> 47:30.439
And they have been so responsible so far.

47:30.640 --> 47:33.680
They have given such noble ideas of democracy

47:33.880 --> 47:36.594
and of freedom and all those things

47:36.795 --> 47:41.800
which are really all belonging to God’s ideas.

47:42.000 --> 47:44.160
And when they talk of all these things,

47:44.360 --> 47:47.876
we must know that there is something much more

47:48.077 --> 47:49.880
that they can give to the whole world.

47:50.080 --> 47:53.201
So many saints are born in this country because they realized

47:53.402 --> 47:55.519
that this is the country where they’ll be able

47:55.720 --> 47:58.360
to prosper better into their spirituality.

47:58.560 --> 48:01.800
So it is a very great responsibility of Americans

48:02.000 --> 48:04.800
to understand that we have had great leaders,

48:05.000 --> 48:06.680
we have had great noble ideals,

48:06.880 --> 48:08.880
we have had got great saints living here,

48:09.080 --> 48:11.680
so many are anxious to come down here.

48:11.880 --> 48:13.320
Only thing what we have to do

48:13.520 --> 48:16.160
is to establish within ourselves our Spirit,

48:16.360 --> 48:20.123
and to be ready and prepared for this great, tremendous work

48:20.324 --> 48:21.760
that is going to come now.

48:21.960 --> 48:24.159
And this is what the world has to do.

48:24.360 --> 48:28.480
If emancipation of the humanity has to take place,

48:28.680 --> 48:32.880
it has to take place only from inside out and not outside in.

48:33.080 --> 48:34.608
Another thing I would like to tell

48:34.809 --> 48:38.120
that the danger is not from outside for America,

48:38.320 --> 48:41.520
not from anywhere else. It is from within themselves.

48:41.760 --> 48:45.520
So be careful. We have to be careful about ourselves

48:45.721 --> 48:47.060
the way we are destroying.

48:47.260 --> 48:48.757
When we say, “What’s wrong?”

48:48.958 --> 48:51.519
we go head long into our destructions.

48:51.720 --> 48:54.720
Human beings should not take freedom as abandonment,

48:54.920 --> 48:59.400
but freedom to enjoy completely and fully.

48:59.600 --> 49:03.040
The freedom that takes you to a destruction is not freedom.

49:03.240 --> 49:05.520
And the right idea of freedom must be taken

49:05.760 --> 49:08.320
and people should know that freedom,

49:08.520 --> 49:12.280
ultimate freedom, is when you become your own master,

49:12.480 --> 49:15.879
when there are no habits,

49:16.080 --> 49:18.120
when you cannot be dominated by anything,

49:18.320 --> 49:21.560
you are above everything. That’s the freedom you have to achieve.

49:21.800 --> 49:22.830
And that is why

49:23.031 --> 49:25.760
people talked long time back in this country about freedom.

49:26.000 --> 49:28.360
They helped all the countries to get their freedom,

49:28.560 --> 49:30.085
and now it is their job

49:30.286 --> 49:34.160
to get them their own freedom within themselves

49:34.361 --> 49:36.040
so that others will also follow.

49:36.240 --> 49:37.759
May God bless you all.

49:37.960 --> 49:39.840
Thank you, Mother.

49:40.074 --> 49:42.018
May God bless you.

49:49.876 --> 49:52.615
Good? All right.

50:13.375 --> 50:16.445
Now, that was really nice of her to give so much time.

50:16.646 --> 50:17.800
You see, it's important,

50:18.040 --> 50:21.320
because your medias are also for Sahaja Yoga only created.

50:21.560 --> 50:23.120
Everything is for Sahaja Yoga.

50:23.320 --> 50:25.094
They have to act for Sahaja Yoga only,

50:25.294 --> 50:27.251
because this has to spread everywhere.

50:27.452 --> 50:29.616
Christ could not have met the whole world, you see?

50:29.817 --> 50:31.880
But I can.

50:42.080 --> 50:45.400
So after all that, I want to announce something very good

50:45.600 --> 50:50.880
and excellent for you, a great news, that

50:51.840 --> 50:57.200
doctor Warren Reeves is going to be engaged to Ursula today.

50:57.800 --> 51:00.920
I hope you like it.

51:23.960 --> 51:26.680
What joy, eh? Creates joy!

51:27.240 --> 51:29.424
Such a great thing! It's a collective.

51:29.625 --> 51:32.320
Marriage has to be collective, then it is sustained.

51:32.520 --> 51:34.840
It has to be collective. Indians know this trick.

51:35.080 --> 51:37.400
You see, they have a collective marriage.

51:37.600 --> 51:39.360
Everything has to be in the marriage;

51:39.560 --> 51:42.873
even the reeves of the village, even the barber,

51:43.074 --> 51:45.682
even the washerman, everybody is to be there,

51:45.883 --> 51:47.640
has to work out something for the marriage.

51:47.840 --> 51:50.000
So the whole community is there to marry

51:50.200 --> 51:52.482
and that's how the marriage you see is there

51:52.683 --> 51:55.120
because everybody looks after you, you see?

51:55.320 --> 51:57.280
If there are many forces on one point

51:57.480 --> 51:59.280
then the point remains where it is.

51:59.480 --> 52:01.371
Doesn't shift, you see?

52:01.572 --> 52:03.840
So there is no shifting in marriage.

52:04.630 --> 52:07.734
Equal and opposite forces always acting on one point,

52:07.935 --> 52:09.745
you better be there.

52:10.560 --> 52:13.880
SY: Mataji, do we have to call him doctor Sellmayer?

52:15.544 --> 52:16.526
SM: What?

52:16.727 --> 52:18.920
SY: Do we have to call him doctor Sellmayer after this?

52:19.120 --> 52:21.394
SM: Doctor...?
SY: Doctor Sellmayer?

52:21.595 --> 52:24.880
SM: To Warren? Yes, yes, during the [unclear], [that's very bad].

52:25.081 --> 52:27.688
SY: Yes, we should definetely.

52:30.400 --> 52:33.412
It's a very good thing, great news for all of you, isn't it?

52:33.613 --> 52:36.083
SY: Yes. Yes, pretty good.

52:38.160 --> 52:39.520
SM: Now...

52:39.720 --> 52:43.080
Should we have the question thing going on?

52:43.280 --> 52:46.040
Because Sahaja Yoga you have understood quite a lot I think.

52:46.240 --> 52:52.080
Have you? Because now in this Vishuddhi chakra of yours

52:52.280 --> 52:55.400
My Vishuddhi is working too much.

52:57.560 --> 53:01.560
It's a continuous everyday, continuously.

53:01.760 --> 53:03.120
And I am coming from Europe

53:03.320 --> 53:07.367
where I had a very intensive programmes for 21 days

53:07.568 --> 53:10.800
and I stayed in London only for two days and third day I was here.

53:11.022 --> 53:14.062
Since that day My throat is really...

53:15.200 --> 53:17.000
First time I felt it.

53:17.320 --> 53:19.720
Now, if you have any questions you better ask,

53:19.920 --> 53:21.840
will be good idea.

53:23.178 --> 53:24.429
SY: Mother.
SM: Yes.

53:24.629 --> 53:25.858
SY: What is the difference

53:26.059 --> 53:28.978
between a self realized being and an enlightened being?

53:29.179 --> 53:30.158
SM: And?

53:30.358 --> 53:33.479
SY: Between a self realized being and an enlightened being?

53:33.680 --> 53:37.256
SM: Same, the same.

53:37.840 --> 53:40.405
SY: The same - an enlightened being and self realized being.

53:40.606 --> 53:44.000
SM: Oh, yes I heard it. So I think now

53:44.240 --> 53:48.052
his attention should not be so much on Me, isn't it?

53:59.560 --> 54:03.119
He should pay more attention to something else now.

54:03.320 --> 54:05.446
Dr. Warren: Then I'm not getting married, Mother.

54:05.647 --> 54:08.400
SM: Listen that! Very bad!

54:12.428 --> 54:15.840
Now, Self Realization and enlightenment is the same thing

54:16.040 --> 54:19.687
like you enlighten first a candle.

54:20.160 --> 54:22.199
So first you are very careful

54:22.400 --> 54:24.280
that it takes up the flame.

54:24.480 --> 54:26.360
Then you look after it very carefully,

54:26.560 --> 54:29.880
could keep your hand watching that it doesn't go out, you see.

54:30.081 --> 54:32.520
In the beginning, very important to see that

54:32.720 --> 54:34.960
it keeps its flame burning.

54:35.200 --> 54:36.880
And you do everything to keep it,

54:37.080 --> 54:39.605
because once it is out again it will be difficult to enlighten,

54:39.806 --> 54:40.840
so you do that.

54:41.040 --> 54:42.599
And that is what is

54:42.799 --> 54:45.079
what we call the awakening first time takes place

54:45.280 --> 54:46.760
and you have to establish it.

54:46.960 --> 54:49.760
Then you establish and once it is established

54:50.000 --> 54:52.880
then you go on enlarging your light

54:53.120 --> 54:55.800
and you see that you become the light.

54:56.720 --> 55:00.159
Spirit is the flame that is burning.

55:00.360 --> 55:01.760
All right?

55:01.960 --> 55:04.968
I think I left My watch somewhere in it...

55:06.560 --> 55:07.680
SY: Mother?
SM: Yes.

55:07.880 --> 55:09.909
SY: Could You say something more about the,

55:10.110 --> 55:13.280
something about negative forces? You mentioned that the other day.

55:13.480 --> 55:16.040
SM: Something about?
SY: About negative forces.

55:16.241 --> 55:17.866
SM: Negative? All right.

55:18.067 --> 55:20.400
SM: About all these spirits and...
