00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:15.645
But as Kundalini rises, on every center&nbsp;
you start getting the light of that center.

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:20.645
At the first center you get back your innocence,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:30.196
your eyes become innocent, your behavior becomes&nbsp;
innocent, you are not filled with lust and greed,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:30.392 --> 00:00:38.220
you don’t look at things with lust and greed, but&nbsp;
you look at things with innocence, which is a very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:45.600
big thing that people have lost and that you get&nbsp;
back and such a person develops many qualities.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.480
One of them is that such a person is full of&nbsp;
fragrance, such a person has a tremendous gravity,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.840
tremendous gravity, and such a&nbsp;
person has tremendous dynamism, and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.500
attraction is a bad word so I don’t&nbsp;
want to use it, but magnetical.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:18.485
His magnets is awakened within him, this&nbsp;
is the center of your magnet of the earth.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:26.400
Such a person develops a tremendous&nbsp;
sense of roots and sense of direction,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.460
you place him anywhere he will know where to go.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.220
Like birds, you place birds anywhere they&nbsp;
know which side is north, south, east, west.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.633
In the same way you also develop your lost&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.802
innocence and your magnet within you&nbsp;
by which you have proper direction;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:55.203
but the highest of all you develop the proper&nbsp;
direction to wisdom which is the wise thing to do.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:02.460
You just don't do stupid things, you just&nbsp;
don't do, even if you ever try to do it,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.179
you will not do it, because you know&nbsp;
it is so stupid, just you don’t do it.

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:14.100
I mean it is so simple to&nbsp;
be wise than to be stupid,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.987
because if you have to be stupid you&nbsp;
have to go out of the way to be stupid&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.987 --> 00:02:26.100
and idiotic; but if you want to be normal&nbsp;
and wise is the easiest thing to do.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:36.180
But what people do is to do things that would make&nbsp;
them more and more stupid, nonsensical, because&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:45.226
also some people told Me they do it, the reason&nbsp;
being they think they have a nuisance value.

00:02:45.226 --> 00:02:49.680
Like in London now we have one funny&nbsp;
stuff going on, they call it what?

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:50.400
"Punk rock."

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.380
You see, it’s a funny stuff.

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.800
Now poor things they don’t know what they&nbsp;
are doing it, and I think the only value&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:09.480
of that punk rock system is this: that&nbsp;
they try to sort of make a nuisance out&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:15.180
of them so that people feel attracted towards&nbsp;
them or sort of a significance out of them.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:21.903
But when you become a realized soul you realize&nbsp;
your significance, because you understand&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:21.903 --> 00:03:31.200
you are part and parcel of the whole and that your&nbsp;
significance is to give Realization to others, the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:38.100
highest of highest, that’s what you have to do now&nbsp;
you are a saint, and that’s how the whole attitude&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:48.065
of cheapiness, of outward shallowness finishes&nbsp;
and you become a serene, dignified personality.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.060
This is not possible through any sermon,&nbsp;
any lecture, it’s only possible when the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:02.431
Kundalini rises you become like a very&nbsp;
dignified child, very dignified child.

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:12.000
I’ve seen one beautiful painting done&nbsp;
of Mother Mary being taught first time.

00:04:12.074 --> 00:04:16.634
You see Her as a child, She is&nbsp;
a very dignified personality,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.856
as a child, She is about ten years of age.

00:04:18.856 --> 00:04:25.038
I’ve seen My own grandchildren who are&nbsp;
not very old but extremely dignified.

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.380
They walk like kings, behave like kings.

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:33.720
In every behavior you find there’s such a&nbsp;
dignity, they’ll never do something shallow,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.220
they never ask for anything, they never&nbsp;
weep for anything, they never cry for&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:43.500
anything, they are so dignified and they&nbsp;
understand it so well what is dignity is.

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:50.100
I don’t have to tell them, because they are born&nbsp;
realized, in the same way you become that, nobody&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:56.466
has to tell you that "do this, or do that," but&nbsp;
you understand that you must have self-respect.

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.980
This happens to you automatically,&nbsp;
this is actualization, nobody has to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.020
tell you that "you be dignified," you just become.

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.452
I’ve seen people who were absolutely absurd,&nbsp;
even from this punk rock we got some people&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.740
and they were so changed that&nbsp;
people could not recognize them,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.500
but one thing bad has happened with this&nbsp;
punk rock that they put some sort of dye&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:26.160
in their head and since then their eyes became&nbsp;
very weak, because these dyes I think made the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:33.480
optic globe covered with some sort of a color and&nbsp;
you can’t see properly, and the eyes became very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:39.600
weak and it took some time for us to remove&nbsp;
the effect of those dyes from their head.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:46.080
We go headlong, "what’s wrong?" There is nothing&nbsp;
wrong in this world if it is a stupid fool,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.260
but for a wise man there are very many things&nbsp;
which are absolutely wrong, and there are very&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:59.674
many things which are absolutely correct, so&nbsp;
you develop your wisdom by this first center.
