00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:19.090
[Music]

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.629
this understanding of what you have

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.860
achieved in sahaja yoga should

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:50.580
immediately make you realize what you

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:53.980
are and when it all has happened to us

00:00:50.580 --> 00:01:01.120
automatically you should be very sincere

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:04.720
about it you must feel that something

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:10.450
really we have achieved or something so

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:15.250
great so we have to be sincere mentally

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:18.600
also we should feel that so this is

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.710
first thing you do is to mentally feel

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:30.869
to maintain you feel that it's so

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:38.740
important but the second part is

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:43.030
different where you see something you

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:47.109
know something and you start opening

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:51.509
your heart about it in the second part

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:54.579
you have to open your heart

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:59.950
so the sincerity comes from an open

00:01:54.579 --> 00:02:03.100
heart if your heart is not open you

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:07.469
cannot be sincere now what does it mean

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.469
that your heart is not open let us see

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.900
we are born again you have got your

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:24.769
realization also it is your birthday in

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:28.609
a way but in the growth of your

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:33.620
knowledge and understanding you have not

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:36.799
kept pace with your heart but what is

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:43.879
the reason for that what is it that

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:47.840
keeps your heart like you can discover

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:54.159
very easily that your heart moves the

00:02:47.840 --> 00:03:01.159
body moves your brain everything because

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:04.849
if your heart stops everything stops but

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:07.010
if your brain stops hardcore stuff so

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:12.200
heart is the most important thing and it

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:19.609
governs the whole being within you now

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:29.629
this special instrument which is very

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:30.909
delicate which circulates also is like a

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.840
stone

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.840
how will it pulsate

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:46.090
so when we say enlarge your heart it

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.090
means that the stone enos of your heart

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:55.230
has to be melted away how does it become

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.230
stony we have to go to the roots of that

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:05.500
it becomes like a stone because the

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:08.470
heart controls the brain as there are

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.870
seven auras on your brain in the same

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:16.390
way there are seven auras on your heart

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:25.090
and all those are us and the ones which

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:28.210
control them on us of the wave now on

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:32.470
the brain as you know there are two

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:36.160
institutions of ego and conditionings we

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:39.960
start pressing the brain too much as a

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:39.960
result of all these auras get dressed

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:47.410
so the auras which are surrounding the

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:58.870
heart also the treasure so this

00:04:47.410 --> 00:05:04.210
conditioning makes the brain pervert but

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:12.310
it doesn't make it a stone only what

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:14.460
makes it a stone is that if he is born

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:18.580
with some sort of a mental derangement

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:20.650
that he cannot think otherwise the brain

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.780
goes on thinking whether with

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:29.550
conditionings or with it it goes on

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:29.550
thinking such a brain

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:39.760
should not affect the heart because

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:43.000
heart affects a brain but the auras

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:50.330
which are manifested from the heart

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:53.090
start becoming dull or disappear so the

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:57.350
auras around the heart are very

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:03.010
sensitive and they feel no use throwing

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:05.900
light on the brain they start becoming

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:10.910
smaller and smaller and that's how the

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:13.970
heart becomes small because they have no

00:06:10.910 --> 00:06:16.940
purpose in life them so they start

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:19.790
becoming smaller and smaller as a result

00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:22.220
the heart becomes small we call somebody

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:25.010
is really small hearted fellow is a

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:29.270
chicken hearted you know we always say

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:34.130
such a man is a stone hearted person all

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:36.980
these happens because of the

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:46.220
conditionings and the ego of the human

00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:50.090
mind and the result is felt but the

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:55.400
heart becoming a stone because heart is

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:59.870
a sensitive thing brain is not that that

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.080
is how we do not know how to be kind to

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:06.880
others how to be nice how to be helpful

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:18.410
how to be gentle and how to be

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:21.260
reassuring protecting others all this we

00:07:18.410 --> 00:07:23.540
have inherited already we have already

00:07:21.260 --> 00:07:25.970
got a stone art when we come to sahaja

00:07:23.540 --> 00:07:29.570
yoga and we have a brain either full of

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:32.870
ego or super-ego so now with your

00:07:29.570 --> 00:07:36.530
Kundalini rising you can clear out your

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:40.150
head first of all so the sincerity will

00:07:36.530 --> 00:07:41.710
come when the Kundalini will move and

00:07:40.150 --> 00:07:44.270
touch

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:48.589
Ramananda which is the seat of your

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:50.990
heart and will expand then the heart

00:07:48.589 --> 00:07:55.369
just comes back like a king returns back

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:58.129
and start dominating the brain so the

00:07:55.369 --> 00:07:59.389
relationship between the truth has to be

00:07:58.129 --> 00:08:01.520
fully understood

00:07:59.389 --> 00:08:04.189
at first the domination of the heart

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:08.779
although we can say the king hood of

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:11.449
heart is cherished is put down not to

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:17.770
zero and then this brain becomes the

00:08:11.449 --> 00:08:25.189
king and he starts ruling us I think I

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:33.169
feel means the brain the even if you

00:08:25.189 --> 00:08:36.800
could give up I think I want everything

00:08:33.169 --> 00:08:41.509
with your eyes you should say I want

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:43.729
another point this body wants you

00:08:41.509 --> 00:08:46.880
separate yourself gradually you start

00:08:43.729 --> 00:08:49.399
separating yourself from all such

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:51.860
situations by never saying I want you

00:08:49.399 --> 00:08:57.139
say this body this heart

00:08:51.860 --> 00:09:00.139
they said you start separating and once

00:08:57.139 --> 00:09:04.519
you are separated all these barriers of

00:09:00.139 --> 00:09:08.149
ego and super-ego will disappear but as

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:11.329
it is also it's very easy to get rid of

00:09:08.149 --> 00:09:14.209
these two it's very easy to get rid of

00:09:11.329 --> 00:09:19.490
these two only by raising your kundalini

00:09:14.209 --> 00:09:22.009
and breaking here Ramanathan this is the

00:09:19.490 --> 00:09:24.560
greatest achievement that you know that

00:09:22.009 --> 00:09:27.410
you can break your brahmarandra

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.269
make your kundalini get connected with

00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:31.250
the all-pervading power that's why I

00:09:29.269 --> 00:09:33.560
always say you must meditate and you

00:09:31.250 --> 00:09:36.319
must be in thoughtless awareness then it

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.939
works out don't pay attention to outside

00:09:36.319 --> 00:09:40.910
things so much tasting you should

00:09:37.939 --> 00:09:43.040
decorate yourself within yours with

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:46.699
sincerity it nice thoughts about

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:51.250
yourself that you are capable absolutely

00:09:46.699 --> 00:09:54.840
capable people and you can use your

00:09:51.250 --> 00:09:56.820
imagination you are

00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:01.560
intelligence rationality whatever you

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:04.770
think you have to find the way to find

00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:07.430
the way again I say to keep your heart

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.430
large
