00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.060
Dassera Celebration
October 21, 2007

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.060
Sydney, Australia

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.060
Today is otherwise a great day, isn’t it?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.060
– Dassera.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.110
So today is Dassera, is a very big day in
India.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.800
They say on this day Ravana was killed.

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:20.410
He was the worst enemy of human beings, and
he was killed.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:37.280
For whatever it is then, as a memory of that
great man, Shri Ram, they celebrate today

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280
Dassera.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:52.000
And on this day they say those who are dushtas,
means bad people or we can say negative, they

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.580
are killed.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.940
Can you imagine?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:13.490
So this day is regarded as very important
in India, and they make a big statue of Ravana.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:31.790
You all know who was Ravana, whom Shri Rama
killed.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:50.170
He was a horrible fellow and he took away
the wife of Shri Ram, Sita, by force.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.639
But She was such a chaste woman that he couldn’t
touch Her.

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:00.469
He tried; he couldn’t touch Her.

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.359
He couldn’t achieve any power over Her.

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:11.840
On the contrary, She was very powerful.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:29.230
So at that time Shri Rama’s mother-in-law,
I should say, who was the wife of Dasaratha,

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:47.140
she said, she used to – she’s like a big
sadhuni – and she said that from today two

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:50.629
marriages are not allowed, only one.

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:55.880
So among Hindus there is only one marriage.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:10.159
They don’t have two marriages; and regarded
as very sinful to have another woman, according

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.390
to Indian culture.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:23.549
There are some people who do it, but is wrong,
is not Indian.

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:31.430
The father-in-law passed the law because he
has, he suffered.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:44.950
He had two wives, and one of them tried to
send Shri Ram to the jungle.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:56.299
She was so cruel because she wanted her son
to become the king, and as it was the mistake

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:12.730
of the father that he had promised that he
will give her a boon because she had saved

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:33.990
him in war; and so now she asked him to send
Shri Ram to the vanavas, to the jungle.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:47.729
By second one she asked to give the kingdom
to her son, who was Lakshmana.

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:51.720
But when Lakshmana came, he didn’t want.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:58.720
He said, “I don’t want to take Shri Rama’s
seat, because it is His right.”

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:09.919
So he went to Shri Ram in the jungle, requested
Him, “You must come.

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:17.479
You must come to Ayodhya, to the capital city,
and You should be crowned.”

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:21.680
Shri Ram said, “I can’t do it.

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:27.889
I have to fulfil My father’s wish.”

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:39.820
But at that moment the father said that in
India nobody will have second marriage.

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.900
Because of two wives the whole family suffered.

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:52.060
So he said, “Only we can have one wife,
and no two wives.”

00:05:52.060 --> 00:06:03.460
Very surprising that even today in India they
believe that you should have only one wife.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:12.531
But what you find in another countries that
people may not have another wife, but they

00:06:12.531 --> 00:06:19.490
have affairs and they do not respect their
wives.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:31.520
This is very sad and this makes the country
suffering, because if the women are treated

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:41.259
like that, the women suffer and if the mother
suffers, the children suffer.

00:06:41.259 --> 00:06:47.490
So he made a law that nobody will marry twice.

00:06:47.490 --> 00:07:03.300
Only Mohammed Sahib said, “All right, we
can have four marriages,” because there

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:19.440
was so much killing and so few men were left
– many women and very few men.

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:28.099
So He said that “All right, you can have
four wives each – solve the problem.”

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:31.780
It does not, it does not solve the problem.

00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:37.479
Even the Muslims now have this problem.

00:07:37.479 --> 00:07:48.310
They marry four times, no doubt, but if you
see their family life they are very sad.

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:53.720
We Indians should not learn anything from
them.

00:07:53.720 --> 00:08:01.800
On the contrary we have to tell the whole
world that “Don’t run after women, look

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:15.150
after yourself,” which is – in the West
people have no sense.

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:25.099
They have one wife, of course, they don’t
have two wives, but they carry on with another

00:08:25.099 --> 00:08:26.530
woman.

00:08:26.530 --> 00:08:40.169
In Sahaja Yoga it’s banned to do these things,
and if they do it like that I tell them that

00:08:40.169 --> 00:08:44.460
“you divorce.”

00:08:44.460 --> 00:08:47.760
And then I arrange their marriages.

00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:56.700
But very sad because why should they, under
the influence of Western life, try to have

00:08:56.700 --> 00:09:03.290
another wife and make the whole thing so polluted?

00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:09.370
Their children suffer, mainly.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:23.420
If the morality of the place is not good the
new generation, the children, they suffer.

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:24.490
And what do we have?

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:31.780
A sick country.

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:46.300
English were once upon a time very proud and
very sensible, but now they have become very

00:09:46.300 --> 00:09:50.870
unhappy because they don’t believe in one
wife.

00:09:50.870 --> 00:09:58.860
They’ll have one wife at home and another
wife somewhere else, and this is a very sad

00:09:58.860 --> 00:09:59.860
thing.

00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:05.110
In Sahaja Yoga we do not tolerate this.

00:10:05.110 --> 00:10:11.670
You have to have one wife and you have to
live with one wife.

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:18.610
Some women are obstinate – all right, I
say, “You can leave Sahaj Yog.”

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:25.630
And some men are also very troublesome so
I tell them, “You leave Sahaja Yoga.”

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:35.040
If you want to have the advantage of being
a Sahaja Yogi, then you cannot marry another

00:10:35.040 --> 00:10:38.689
woman or another man.

00:10:38.689 --> 00:10:43.760
You have to lead a happy life with each other.

00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:50.700
If you can’t do it, then you get out of
Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:50.700 --> 00:10:59.579
But there are some people who had horrible
times with their wives or husbands, so a word

00:10:59.579 --> 00:11:08.830
I have said that “All right, those who are
flirting and are not having a proper personality,

00:11:08.830 --> 00:11:15.300
they can’t be in Sahaja Yoga.”

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:18.830
We have to make very pure society.

00:11:18.830 --> 00:11:30.320
Our duty is to show that we can live happily
without fighting, and the Sahaja Yogis are

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.970
known to be very sensible husbands.

00:11:33.970 --> 00:11:39.370
I am very happy to see you all here.

00:11:39.370 --> 00:11:55.260
I know some of them, I’ve married them,
and they are very happy.

00:11:55.260 --> 00:12:06.050
So I have to tell all of you, men and women,
that we have to lead a dedicated life.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:14.570
If the husband is flirting let him go to hell,
or if the wife is flirting let her go to hell.

00:12:14.570 --> 00:12:22.290
We are Sahaja Yogis and we have to keep our
characters good.

00:12:22.290 --> 00:12:31.040
If you have a good character you enjoy life
of your own.

00:12:31.040 --> 00:12:37.160
If you have a frivolous life you can never
enjoy.

00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.209
You go on running after this one and that
one.

00:12:41.209 --> 00:12:51.310
Such people can never be happy, and they do
all kinds of nonsense and waste their lives;

00:12:51.310 --> 00:13:00.589
but by the time they die their condition is
so bad, very bad.

00:13:00.589 --> 00:13:03.480
Such people suffer a lot.

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:12.780
I have seen them suffering, suffering so badly.

00:13:12.780 --> 00:13:25.980
So we are husband and wife to enjoy each other
and to lead a happy life, not to become miserable.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:36.220
All of you now married in Sahaja Yoga, maybe
some of you haven’t tasted a good married

00:13:36.220 --> 00:13:39.160
life, but what to do?

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:50.660
That’s not the mistake with Sahaj Yog; is
the mistake with you yourself, and mistake

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:53.930
with your wife.

00:13:53.930 --> 00:14:04.600
So everybody must stand upon the right and
lead a right life, instead of wasting energy

00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:09.250
over quarrelling and fighting.

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:21.399
Try to find out, why do you quarrel and why
do you fight, on what points there are differences?

00:14:21.399 --> 00:14:29.560
There has to be difference, doesn’t matter
– after all, you are two persons – there

00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:32.410
has to be differences.

00:14:32.410 --> 00:14:37.010
But difference should not create problem.

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:41.449
On the contrary you must enjoy the difference.

00:14:41.449 --> 00:14:49.111
As long as [until] you are a dedicated wife
and you have a dedicated husband, you can

00:14:49.111 --> 00:14:50.730
never enjoy life.

00:14:50.730 --> 00:14:56.470
All the time you will be worried and upset.

00:14:56.470 --> 00:15:08.690
So all of you, I thank you very much that
on such a great auspicious day all have come,

00:15:08.690 --> 00:15:14.089
and all look very happy.

00:15:14.089 --> 00:15:53.790
Thank you very much.
