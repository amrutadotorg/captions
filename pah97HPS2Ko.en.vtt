00:03.060 --> 00:04.060
Dassera Celebration
October 21, 2007

00:04.060 --> 00:05.060
Sydney, Australia

00:05.060 --> 00:06.060
Today is otherwise a great day, isn’t it?

00:06.060 --> 00:07.060
– Dassera.

00:07.060 --> 00:10.110
So today is Dassera, is a very big day in
India.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.800
They say on this day Ravana was killed.

00:12.800 --> 00:20.410
He was the worst enemy of human beings, and
he was killed.

00:20.410 --> 00:37.280
For whatever it is then, as a memory of that
great man, Shri Ram, they celebrate today

00:37.280 --> 00:38.280
Dassera.

00:38.280 --> 00:52.000
And on this day they say those who are dushtas,
means bad people or we can say negative, they

00:52.000 --> 00:53.580
are killed.

00:53.580 --> 00:55.940
Can you imagine?

00:55.940 --> 01:13.490
So this day is regarded as very important
in India, and they make a big statue of Ravana.

01:13.490 --> 01:31.790
You all know who was Ravana, whom Shri Rama
killed.

01:31.790 --> 01:50.170
He was a horrible fellow and he took away
the wife of Shri Ram, Sita, by force.

01:50.170 --> 01:56.639
But She was such a chaste woman that he couldn’t
touch Her.

01:56.639 --> 02:00.469
He tried; he couldn’t touch Her.

02:00.469 --> 02:06.359
He couldn’t achieve any power over Her.

02:06.359 --> 02:11.840
On the contrary, She was very powerful.

02:11.840 --> 02:29.230
So at that time Shri Rama’s mother-in-law,
I should say, who was the wife of Dasaratha,

02:29.230 --> 02:47.140
she said, she used to – she’s like a big
sadhuni – and she said that from today two

02:47.140 --> 02:50.629
marriages are not allowed, only one.

02:50.629 --> 02:55.880
So among Hindus there is only one marriage.

02:55.880 --> 03:10.159
They don’t have two marriages; and regarded
as very sinful to have another woman, according

03:10.159 --> 03:12.390
to Indian culture.

03:12.390 --> 03:23.549
There are some people who do it, but is wrong,
is not Indian.

03:23.549 --> 03:31.430
The father-in-law passed the law because he
has, he suffered.

03:31.430 --> 03:44.950
He had two wives, and one of them tried to
send Shri Ram to the jungle.

03:44.950 --> 03:56.299
She was so cruel because she wanted her son
to become the king, and as it was the mistake

03:56.299 --> 04:12.730
of the father that he had promised that he
will give her a boon because she had saved

04:12.730 --> 04:33.990
him in war; and so now she asked him to send
Shri Ram to the vanavas, to the jungle.

04:33.990 --> 04:47.729
By second one she asked to give the kingdom
to her son, who was Lakshmana.

04:47.729 --> 04:51.720
But when Lakshmana came, he didn’t want.

04:51.720 --> 04:58.720
He said, “I don’t want to take Shri Rama’s
seat, because it is His right.”

04:58.720 --> 05:09.919
So he went to Shri Ram in the jungle, requested
Him, “You must come.

05:09.919 --> 05:17.479
You must come to Ayodhya, to the capital city,
and You should be crowned.”

05:17.479 --> 05:21.680
Shri Ram said, “I can’t do it.

05:21.680 --> 05:27.889
I have to fulfil My father’s wish.”

05:27.889 --> 05:39.820
But at that moment the father said that in
India nobody will have second marriage.

05:39.820 --> 05:44.900
Because of two wives the whole family suffered.

05:44.900 --> 05:52.060
So he said, “Only we can have one wife,
and no two wives.”

05:52.060 --> 06:03.460
Very surprising that even today in India they
believe that you should have only one wife.

06:03.460 --> 06:12.531
But what you find in another countries that
people may not have another wife, but they

06:12.531 --> 06:19.490
have affairs and they do not respect their
wives.

06:19.490 --> 06:31.520
This is very sad and this makes the country
suffering, because if the women are treated

06:31.520 --> 06:41.259
like that, the women suffer and if the mother
suffers, the children suffer.

06:41.259 --> 06:47.490
So he made a law that nobody will marry twice.

06:47.490 --> 07:03.300
Only Mohammed Sahib said, “All right, we
can have four marriages,” because there

07:03.300 --> 07:19.440
was so much killing and so few men were left
– many women and very few men.

07:19.440 --> 07:28.099
So He said that “All right, you can have
four wives each – solve the problem.”

07:28.099 --> 07:31.780
It does not, it does not solve the problem.

07:31.780 --> 07:37.479
Even the Muslims now have this problem.

07:37.479 --> 07:48.310
They marry four times, no doubt, but if you
see their family life they are very sad.

07:48.310 --> 07:53.720
We Indians should not learn anything from
them.

07:53.720 --> 08:01.800
On the contrary we have to tell the whole
world that “Don’t run after women, look

08:01.800 --> 08:15.150
after yourself,” which is – in the West
people have no sense.

08:15.150 --> 08:25.099
They have one wife, of course, they don’t
have two wives, but they carry on with another

08:25.099 --> 08:26.530
woman.

08:26.530 --> 08:40.169
In Sahaja Yoga it’s banned to do these things,
and if they do it like that I tell them that

08:40.169 --> 08:44.460
“you divorce.”

08:44.460 --> 08:47.760
And then I arrange their marriages.

08:47.760 --> 08:56.700
But very sad because why should they, under
the influence of Western life, try to have

08:56.700 --> 09:03.290
another wife and make the whole thing so polluted?

09:03.290 --> 09:09.370
Their children suffer, mainly.

09:09.370 --> 09:23.420
If the morality of the place is not good the
new generation, the children, they suffer.

09:23.420 --> 09:24.490
And what do we have?

09:24.490 --> 09:31.780
A sick country.

09:31.780 --> 09:46.300
English were once upon a time very proud and
very sensible, but now they have become very

09:46.300 --> 09:50.870
unhappy because they don’t believe in one
wife.

09:50.870 --> 09:58.860
They’ll have one wife at home and another
wife somewhere else, and this is a very sad

09:58.860 --> 09:59.860
thing.

09:59.860 --> 10:05.110
In Sahaja Yoga we do not tolerate this.

10:05.110 --> 10:11.670
You have to have one wife and you have to
live with one wife.

10:11.670 --> 10:18.610
Some women are obstinate – all right, I
say, “You can leave Sahaj Yog.”

10:18.610 --> 10:25.630
And some men are also very troublesome so
I tell them, “You leave Sahaja Yoga.”

10:25.630 --> 10:35.040
If you want to have the advantage of being
a Sahaja Yogi, then you cannot marry another

10:35.040 --> 10:38.689
woman or another man.

10:38.689 --> 10:43.760
You have to lead a happy life with each other.

10:43.760 --> 10:50.700
If you can’t do it, then you get out of
Sahaja Yoga.

10:50.700 --> 10:59.579
But there are some people who had horrible
times with their wives or husbands, so a word

10:59.579 --> 11:08.830
I have said that “All right, those who are
flirting and are not having a proper personality,

11:08.830 --> 11:15.300
they can’t be in Sahaja Yoga.”

11:15.300 --> 11:18.830
We have to make very pure society.

11:18.830 --> 11:30.320
Our duty is to show that we can live happily
without fighting, and the Sahaja Yogis are

11:30.320 --> 11:33.970
known to be very sensible husbands.

11:33.970 --> 11:39.370
I am very happy to see you all here.

11:39.370 --> 11:55.260
I know some of them, I’ve married them,
and they are very happy.

11:55.260 --> 12:06.050
So I have to tell all of you, men and women,
that we have to lead a dedicated life.

12:06.050 --> 12:14.570
If the husband is flirting let him go to hell,
or if the wife is flirting let her go to hell.

12:14.570 --> 12:22.290
We are Sahaja Yogis and we have to keep our
characters good.

12:22.290 --> 12:31.040
If you have a good character you enjoy life
of your own.

12:31.040 --> 12:37.160
If you have a frivolous life you can never
enjoy.

12:37.160 --> 12:41.209
You go on running after this one and that
one.

12:41.209 --> 12:51.310
Such people can never be happy, and they do
all kinds of nonsense and waste their lives;

12:51.310 --> 13:00.589
but by the time they die their condition is
so bad, very bad.

13:00.589 --> 13:03.480
Such people suffer a lot.

13:03.480 --> 13:12.780
I have seen them suffering, suffering so badly.

13:12.780 --> 13:25.980
So we are husband and wife to enjoy each other
and to lead a happy life, not to become miserable.

13:25.980 --> 13:36.220
All of you now married in Sahaja Yoga, maybe
some of you haven’t tasted a good married

13:36.220 --> 13:39.160
life, but what to do?

13:39.160 --> 13:50.660
That’s not the mistake with Sahaj Yog; is
the mistake with you yourself, and mistake

13:50.660 --> 13:53.930
with your wife.

13:53.930 --> 14:04.600
So everybody must stand upon the right and
lead a right life, instead of wasting energy

14:04.600 --> 14:09.250
over quarrelling and fighting.

14:09.250 --> 14:21.399
Try to find out, why do you quarrel and why
do you fight, on what points there are differences?

14:21.399 --> 14:29.560
There has to be difference, doesn’t matter
– after all, you are two persons – there

14:29.560 --> 14:32.410
has to be differences.

14:32.410 --> 14:37.010
But difference should not create problem.

14:37.010 --> 14:41.449
On the contrary you must enjoy the difference.

14:41.449 --> 14:49.111
As long as [until] you are a dedicated wife
and you have a dedicated husband, you can

14:49.111 --> 14:50.730
never enjoy life.

14:50.730 --> 14:56.470
All the time you will be worried and upset.

14:56.470 --> 15:08.690
So all of you, I thank you very much that
on such a great auspicious day all have come,

15:08.690 --> 15:14.089
and all look very happy.

15:14.089 --> 15:53.790
Thank you very much.
