00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:08.667
Adi Shakti Puja

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:38.709
2004, Cabella Ligure, Ä°talya

00:11:02.333 --> 00:11:07.875
Today's meeting is very special.

00:11:08.875 --> 00:11:12.041
It's a very, very special day also,

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:19.542
extremely special and very blissful.

00:11:21.375 --> 00:11:29.542
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

00:11:30.834 --> 00:11:42.542
about the born Order

00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:49.125
born Power,

00:11:51.166 --> 00:11:57.750
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

00:11:58.959 --> 00:12:03.041
And this one is responsible

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:09.959
for creating this great universe.

00:12:11.834 --> 00:12:19.083
Why this has started and how it works out is...

00:12:19.291 --> 00:12:21.667
already you know;

00:12:21.875 --> 00:12:24.291
I need not talk about that.

00:12:25.458 --> 00:12:29.792
But today we have to talk about this Power,

00:12:31.667 --> 00:12:35.667
which is hidden in your hearts,

00:12:36.667 --> 00:12:41.667
by which you can do whatever you like to create

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:47.667
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

00:12:47.959 --> 00:12:51.291
everything that is not known so far.

00:12:53.417 --> 00:12:58.375
That is quite possible;

00:13:00.667 --> 00:13:05.458
that is quite possible and is being done,

00:13:05.667 --> 00:13:09.542
but what is difficult is

00:13:09.709 --> 00:13:16.417
how to make people more adaptable, more

00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:26.250
in tune with each other, absolutely.

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:32.250
It seems to be a difficult thing.

00:13:33.250 --> 00:13:35.959
They're all right among themselves,

00:13:36.208 --> 00:13:40.083
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

00:13:40.417 --> 00:13:47.166
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

00:13:47.375 --> 00:13:53.709
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

00:13:53.917 --> 00:13:56.625
and it should not be done.

00:13:56.917 --> 00:13:59.375
That's not supposed to be;

00:13:59.667 --> 00:14:02.458
they're not supposed to be like that,

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:07.458
but it has to work out.

00:14:08.041 --> 00:14:09.959
Now the problem is,

00:14:13.291 --> 00:14:18.291
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

00:14:19.583 --> 00:14:20.959
but they do not become

00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:25.583
so one with each other as they should have.

00:14:26.333 --> 00:14:30.125
Now, how to solve this problem?

00:14:30.291 --> 00:14:32.083
Many people have asked Me,

00:14:32.375 --> 00:14:37.166
"Mother, how to make that problem";

00:14:37.375 --> 00:14:38.834
I just smiled.

00:14:39.834 --> 00:14:43.792
Because, if you see the original idea

00:14:44.083 --> 00:14:53.375
why we started this x ray

00:14:53.667 --> 00:14:56.500
why we started this new kind of a

00:15:01.792 --> 00:15:08.083
understanding, new kind of penetration -

00:15:08.375 --> 00:15:15.875
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

00:15:16.166 --> 00:15:17.417
in every person.

00:15:18.041 --> 00:15:24.417
Now you should be very much thankful that

00:15:24.625 --> 00:15:29.208
you are all one, one inside,

00:15:29.417 --> 00:15:31.375
there's nothing second.

00:15:31.667 --> 00:15:37.333
There's only one and that one when it speaks

00:15:37.542 --> 00:15:43.250
and when it wants to administer something,

00:15:43.750 --> 00:15:48.667
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

00:15:48.875 --> 00:15:53.792
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

00:15:54.291 --> 00:15:59.750
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

00:16:00.959 --> 00:16:08.500
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:11.875
roving into some sort of a problem,

00:16:12.166 --> 00:16:16.375
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:18.542 --> 00:16:23.083
Now the main problem that we have is that

00:16:23.375 --> 00:16:25.875
we don't realize that we have no problem.

00:16:28.083 --> 00:16:30.625
We are without any problems.

00:16:31.125 --> 00:16:32.667
We think that there are problems and

00:16:32.959 --> 00:16:34.583
we should deal with problems,

00:16:34.792 --> 00:16:37.959
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:40.291
I don't see any problem anywhere.

00:16:41.333 --> 00:16:43.458
Those who think they have problems,

00:16:43.792 --> 00:16:45.875
I've asked them to write it down,

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:47.959
and I'll try to answer them

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:51.375
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

00:16:51.542 --> 00:16:55.166
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

00:16:55.959 --> 00:17:01.458
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.792
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

00:17:07.083 --> 00:17:12.083
in their hearts of their oneness.

00:17:12.291 --> 00:17:19.375
All this comes from within, not from without,

00:17:20.250 --> 00:17:24.417
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

00:17:25.083 --> 00:17:30.417
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

00:17:30.917 --> 00:17:33.166
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:41.333
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

00:17:41.834 --> 00:17:44.959
any other coding something,

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:48.166
no need; it's all there.

00:17:48.375 --> 00:17:51.625
Just you have to be that, to become that.

00:17:51.834 --> 00:17:54.792
This is rather difficult to understand for people

00:17:55.083 --> 00:18:00.166
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

00:18:00.458 --> 00:18:02.083
to become the same.

00:18:02.375 --> 00:18:04.709
But you are, you are; because

00:18:04.917 --> 00:18:09.041
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

00:18:09.375 --> 00:18:13.959
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

00:18:14.166 --> 00:18:21.792
One in the sense that your everything,

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.583
impulse, every feeling,

00:18:27.583 --> 00:18:34.583
every understanding is the same.

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:40.834
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

00:18:41.041 --> 00:18:45.667
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

00:18:45.959 --> 00:18:50.166
that it is different, but actually it is not.

00:18:50.458 --> 00:18:54.375
It is only one, one relationship,

00:18:54.542 --> 00:18:59.709
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

00:18:59.875 --> 00:19:04.959
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

00:19:05.166 --> 00:19:07.959
that whatever one may try,

00:19:09.291 --> 00:19:12.291
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:18.250
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

00:19:19.250 --> 00:19:21.125
you are looked after (by) Her.

00:19:21.709 --> 00:19:25.083
Everything seems to be one to Me

00:19:25.291 --> 00:19:27.875
while you people think there is a different

00:19:28.166 --> 00:19:32.250
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

00:19:34.542 --> 00:19:37.000
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

00:19:37.333 --> 00:19:44.500
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

00:19:48.458 --> 00:19:52.500
Myself, I am one with you

00:19:52.709 --> 00:19:57.500
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

00:19:57.709 --> 00:20:03.166
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

00:20:03.166 --> 00:20:07.917
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:14.542
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:16.625
depends on your temperament.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:20.792
If that temperament changes a little bit,

00:20:20.959 --> 00:20:24.500
you will see the oneness among all of you

00:20:24.875 --> 00:20:28.834
and the differences will be lost in no time.

00:20:29.834 --> 00:20:32.500
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:36.375
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

00:20:36.667 --> 00:20:42.750
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

00:20:43.083 --> 00:20:46.500
Why? Because I never understood him.

00:20:46.583 --> 00:20:52.625
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

00:20:52.625 --> 00:20:56.500
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

00:20:56.792 --> 00:21:00.542
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

00:21:00.750 --> 00:21:04.625
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

00:21:04.792 --> 00:21:09.500
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

00:21:09.834 --> 00:21:16.959
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

00:21:18.291 --> 00:21:20.709
So, the truth started long time back,

00:21:20.834 --> 00:21:28.667
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

00:21:28.792 --> 00:21:36.750
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

00:21:36.959 --> 00:21:39.834
and then the truth went away.

00:21:40.041 --> 00:21:43.291
Like, I would say, that the snake...

00:21:43.583 --> 00:21:49.500
snake was born out of ignorance

00:21:50.208 --> 00:21:53.041
that the other snakes started supporting.

00:21:53.667 --> 00:21:57.834
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:04.834
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

00:22:04.834 --> 00:22:09.166
and believing in it and started fighting,

00:22:09.375 --> 00:22:12.667
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:19.041
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

00:22:19.125 --> 00:22:22.500
How much one should follow their nonsense?

00:22:22.542 --> 00:22:28.000
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.834
It's very difficult.

00:22:30.166 --> 00:22:34.250
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

00:22:34.583 --> 00:22:41.917
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

00:22:42.041 --> 00:22:43.583
Why?

00:22:43.709 --> 00:22:47.333
- Because we are standing in untruth.

00:22:47.542 --> 00:22:50.417
Our own understanding is untruth

00:22:50.583 --> 00:22:54.291
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

00:22:54.667 --> 00:23:00.417
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:05.041
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

00:23:05.041 --> 00:23:07.792
Should not, but it happens.

00:23:08.083 --> 00:23:10.291
So that means there is something wrong

00:23:10.583 --> 00:23:13.792
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

00:23:13.959 --> 00:23:16.208
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:20.709
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

00:23:20.875 --> 00:23:23.875
We cannot face ourselves.

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:27.083
We face others, not ourselves.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.166
We never see ourselves.

00:23:30.333 --> 00:23:37.291
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

00:23:37.375 --> 00:23:42.333
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

00:23:42.667 --> 00:23:45.709
And that's how the Mother came here

00:23:45.917 --> 00:23:52.208
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

00:23:52.208 --> 00:23:58.166
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

00:23:58.333 --> 00:24:01.458
And you'll be amazed at yourself

00:24:01.750 --> 00:24:04.959
how much you have already a knowledge

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:08.375
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

00:24:08.375 --> 00:24:13.125
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

00:24:13.333 --> 00:24:17.625
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

00:24:17.625 --> 00:24:25.583
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

00:24:25.792 --> 00:24:27.667
but they are not.

00:24:27.792 --> 00:24:31.333
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

00:24:31.333 --> 00:24:35.417
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

00:24:35.583 --> 00:24:37.500
and they don't have to become anything.

00:24:37.625 --> 00:24:39.750
Then there's no problem.

00:24:40.041 --> 00:24:43.125
But when you have accepted that there is

00:24:44.333 --> 00:24:48.333
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

00:24:48.625 --> 00:24:49.917
and you are different,

00:24:50.125 --> 00:24:52.834
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

00:24:52.834 --> 00:25:00.083
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

00:25:00.291 --> 00:25:04.709
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

00:25:04.750 --> 00:25:09.125
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

00:25:09.417 --> 00:25:11.417
all the same, very much.

00:25:11.500 --> 00:25:15.542
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

00:25:15.959 --> 00:25:20.333
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

00:25:20.625 --> 00:25:23.125
will be solved without any difficulty.

00:25:23.834 --> 00:25:26.500
Today's Puja is a special one

00:25:26.709 --> 00:25:30.125
because you are doing the Puja of something

00:25:30.417 --> 00:25:32.333
that never went into any transformation,

00:25:33.333 --> 00:25:39.250
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

00:25:39.542 --> 00:25:44.417
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

00:25:44.709 --> 00:25:48.875
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

00:25:49.041 --> 00:25:51.166
Why anyone has to say?

00:25:51.166 --> 00:25:54.917
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

00:25:55.125 --> 00:25:57.333
That's the point we come to

00:25:57.375 --> 00:26:00.333
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

00:26:00.625 --> 00:26:04.041
and not to get it lost in the words

00:26:04.250 --> 00:26:10.917
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

00:26:11.083 --> 00:26:14.458
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

00:26:14.458 --> 00:26:19.000
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:25.041
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

00:26:25.375 --> 00:26:26.959
there's no danger;

00:26:27.583 --> 00:26:31.417
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

00:26:31.542 --> 00:26:35.291
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:40.959
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

00:26:41.083 --> 00:26:46.041
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

00:26:46.250 --> 00:26:50.625
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:54.166
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

00:26:54.667 --> 00:26:57.709
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

00:26:57.917 --> 00:27:02.500
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

00:27:02.917 --> 00:27:06.166
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

00:27:06.291 --> 00:27:09.542
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:16.709
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

00:27:16.875 --> 00:27:21.875
being English,  being English, European and all that.

00:27:22.208 --> 00:27:24.083
But we are not.

00:27:24.291 --> 00:27:28.667
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

00:27:28.834 --> 00:27:34.458
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
