00:00.709 --> 00:08.667
Adi Shakti Puja

00:30.750 --> 00:38.709
2004, Cabella Ligure, İtalya

11:02.333 --> 11:07.875
Today's meeting is very special.

11:08.875 --> 11:12.041
It's a very, very special day also,

11:12.208 --> 11:19.542
extremely special and very blissful.

11:21.375 --> 11:29.542
The reason is, it talks and sings and says

11:30.834 --> 11:42.542
about the born Order

11:42.750 --> 11:49.125
born Power,

11:51.166 --> 11:57.750
the Original, the Adi, the Primordial.

11:58.959 --> 12:03.041
And this one is responsible

12:03.250 --> 12:09.959
for creating this great universe.

12:11.834 --> 12:19.083
Why this has started and how it works out is...

12:19.291 --> 12:21.667
already you know;

12:21.875 --> 12:24.291
I need not talk about that.

12:25.458 --> 12:29.792
But today we have to talk about this Power,

12:31.667 --> 12:35.667
which is hidden in your hearts,

12:36.667 --> 12:41.667
by which you can do whatever you like to create

12:41.959 --> 12:47.667
a new world, a new family,  a new standards,

12:47.959 --> 12:51.291
everything that is not known so far.

12:53.417 --> 12:58.375
That is quite possible;

13:00.667 --> 13:05.458
that is quite possible and is being done,

13:05.667 --> 13:09.542
but what is difficult is

13:09.709 --> 13:16.417
how to make people more adaptable, more

13:21.208 --> 13:26.250
in tune with each other, absolutely.

13:26.583 --> 13:32.250
It seems to be a difficult thing.

13:33.250 --> 13:35.959
They're all right among themselves,

13:36.208 --> 13:40.083
if they are own friends, their own styles and things.

13:40.417 --> 13:47.166
But to make them absolutely one, one with each other

13:47.375 --> 13:53.709
in one tune, in one line is very, very difficult

13:53.917 --> 13:56.625
and it should not be done.

13:56.917 --> 13:59.375
That's not supposed to be;

13:59.667 --> 14:02.458
they're not supposed to be like that,

14:02.667 --> 14:07.458
but it has to work out.

14:08.041 --> 14:09.959
Now the problem is,

14:13.291 --> 14:18.291
we have beautiful people, beautiful souls,

14:19.583 --> 14:20.959
but they do not become

14:21.291 --> 14:25.583
so one with each other as they should have.

14:26.333 --> 14:30.125
Now, how to solve this problem?

14:30.291 --> 14:32.083
Many people have asked Me,

14:32.375 --> 14:37.166
"Mother, how to make that problem";

14:37.375 --> 14:38.834
I just smiled.

14:39.834 --> 14:43.792
Because, if you see the original idea

14:44.083 --> 14:53.375
why we started this x ray

14:53.667 --> 14:56.500
why we started this new kind of a

15:01.792 --> 15:08.083
understanding, new kind of penetration -

15:08.375 --> 15:15.875
because we wanted to find out the oneness, the newness

15:16.166 --> 15:17.417
in every person.

15:18.041 --> 15:24.417
Now you should be very much thankful that

15:24.625 --> 15:29.208
you are all one, one inside,

15:29.417 --> 15:31.375
there's nothing second.

15:31.667 --> 15:37.333
There's only one and that one when it speaks

15:37.542 --> 15:43.250
and when it wants to administer something,

15:43.750 --> 15:48.667
then you'll be amazed that it's all done the same way.

15:48.875 --> 15:53.792
It's the same thing and it works out the same way.

15:54.291 --> 15:59.750
There is no change, there's no difference between the two.

16:00.959 --> 16:08.500
Despite that, despite that, our minds are roving,

16:08.792 --> 16:11.875
roving into some sort of a problem,

16:12.166 --> 16:16.375
which has no significance in Sahaja Yoga.

16:18.542 --> 16:23.083
Now the main problem that we have is that

16:23.375 --> 16:25.875
we don't realize that we have no problem.

16:28.083 --> 16:30.625
We are without any problems.

16:31.125 --> 16:32.667
We think that there are problems and

16:32.959 --> 16:34.583
we should deal with problems,

16:34.792 --> 16:37.959
but there are none; none of those problems are there.

16:38.250 --> 16:40.291
I don't see any problem anywhere.

16:41.333 --> 16:43.458
Those who think they have problems,

16:43.792 --> 16:45.875
I've asked them to write it down,

16:46.083 --> 16:47.959
and I'll try to answer them

16:48.250 --> 16:51.375
and tell them what sort of a problem it is.

16:51.542 --> 16:55.166
But before I could do anything, I would like to say

16:55.959 --> 17:01.458
that still our Sahaja Yogis are not come to that level

17:01.750 --> 17:05.792
to understand the oneness, the uniqueness

17:07.083 --> 17:12.083
in their hearts of their oneness.

17:12.291 --> 17:19.375
All this comes from within, not from without,

17:20.250 --> 17:24.417
so all efforts made outside is of no use.

17:25.083 --> 17:30.417
We have to be effortless and become what we are.

17:30.917 --> 17:33.166
There you'll find  there is no... nothing.

17:33.333 --> 17:41.333
There is no need to have another... another meeting or

17:41.834 --> 17:44.959
any other coding something,

17:45.250 --> 17:48.166
no need; it's all there.

17:48.375 --> 17:51.625
Just you have to be that, to become that.

17:51.834 --> 17:54.792
This is rather difficult to understand for people

17:55.083 --> 18:00.166
who have different noses, different faces, different everything,

18:00.458 --> 18:02.083
to become the same.

18:02.375 --> 18:04.709
But you are, you are; because

18:04.917 --> 18:09.041
you don't know that you are that's why you are looking different.

18:09.375 --> 18:13.959
So, I have to tell you one thing:  that you are all One.

18:14.166 --> 18:21.792
One in the sense that your everything,

18:22.000 --> 18:26.583
impulse, every feeling,

18:27.583 --> 18:34.583
every understanding is the same.

18:36.375 --> 18:40.834
Only thing is that it arises at a wrong time,

18:41.041 --> 18:45.667
at different times and it gives you a wrong impression

18:45.959 --> 18:50.166
that it is different, but actually it is not.

18:50.458 --> 18:54.375
It is only one, one relationship,

18:54.542 --> 18:59.709
and the relationship is with the Adi Shakti

18:59.875 --> 19:04.959
- that you are a part and parcel of Adi Shakti;

19:05.166 --> 19:07.959
that whatever one may try,

19:09.291 --> 19:12.291
one cannot get separated from Adi Shakti.

19:12.500 --> 19:18.250
You are born out of Her and you are guided by Her,

19:19.250 --> 19:21.125
you are looked after (by) Her.

19:21.709 --> 19:25.083
Everything seems to be one to Me

19:25.291 --> 19:27.875
while you people think there is a different

19:28.166 --> 19:32.250
line of a course, line of action, which is wrong.

19:34.542 --> 19:37.000
Whatever I may say, it has to be proved,

19:37.333 --> 19:44.500
otherwise why should you accept such a ghastly statement?

19:48.458 --> 19:52.500
Myself, I am one with you

19:52.709 --> 19:57.500
and I am always... will remain the same with all of you.

19:57.709 --> 20:03.166
For Me there is no difference. I don't see anything like that.

20:03.166 --> 20:07.917
It's outside; it's only your clothes and your style.

20:08.250 --> 20:14.542
Inside, maybe, what temperament you have,

20:14.750 --> 20:16.625
depends on your temperament.

20:17.750 --> 20:20.792
If that temperament changes a little bit,

20:20.959 --> 20:24.500
you will see the oneness among all of you

20:24.875 --> 20:28.834
and the differences will be lost in no time.

20:29.834 --> 20:32.500
Today I saw a very dangerous man.

20:32.500 --> 20:36.375
I thought he can kill Me if he wants.

20:36.667 --> 20:42.750
He can do whatever he likes. But no, it didn't happen.

20:43.083 --> 20:46.500
Why? Because I never understood him.

20:46.583 --> 20:52.625
He was not like that.  He just wanted to show his respect.

20:52.625 --> 20:56.500
He didn't want to kill Me or didn't want to do anything wrong.

20:56.792 --> 21:00.542
It's very surprising how you understand each other.

21:00.750 --> 21:04.625
Unless and until you have proper understanding of each other,

21:04.792 --> 21:09.500
you cannot achieve anything that is sober [Not clear],

21:09.834 --> 21:16.959
that is essential, that is right, that is the truth.

21:18.291 --> 21:20.709
So, the truth started long time back,

21:20.834 --> 21:28.667
much before anybody could think of having a truth here.

21:28.792 --> 21:36.750
It's all went off with so many things which were not truthful

21:36.959 --> 21:39.834
and then the truth went away.

21:40.041 --> 21:43.291
Like, I would say, that the snake...

21:43.583 --> 21:49.500
snake was born out of ignorance

21:50.208 --> 21:53.041
that the other snakes started supporting.

21:53.667 --> 21:57.834
Snakes after snakes,  they started growing up

21:58.000 --> 22:04.834
and filling the whole universe with dishonesty and with wrong ideas

22:04.834 --> 22:09.166
and believing in it and started fighting,

22:09.375 --> 22:12.667
killing each other. But they were all snakes.

22:12.750 --> 22:19.041
So how much one should believe in their nonsense?

22:19.125 --> 22:22.500
How much one should follow their nonsense?

22:22.542 --> 22:28.000
How much anybody should accept their nonsense?

22:28.000 --> 22:29.834
It's very difficult.

22:30.166 --> 22:34.250
But it is acceptable much more than the truth.

22:34.583 --> 22:41.917
The truth is not so very easily accepted as the untruth is.

22:42.041 --> 22:43.583
Why?

22:43.709 --> 22:47.333
- Because we are standing in untruth.

22:47.542 --> 22:50.417
Our own understanding is untruth

22:50.583 --> 22:54.291
and we'll have to change our understanding to truth,

22:54.667 --> 23:00.417
which is not difficult because we are truth. We are the truth.

23:00.500 --> 23:05.041
To become the truth, which we are, why should it be difficult?

23:05.041 --> 23:07.792
Should not, but it happens.

23:08.083 --> 23:10.291
So that means there is something wrong

23:10.583 --> 23:13.792
somewhere within us, which we should find out.

23:13.959 --> 23:16.208
And the thing that isnwrong with us,

23:16.500 --> 23:20.709
within, is that we cannot face ourselves.

23:20.875 --> 23:23.875
We cannot face ourselves.

23:24.125 --> 23:27.083
We face others, not ourselves.

23:27.250 --> 23:30.166
We never see ourselves.

23:30.333 --> 23:37.291
We have no idea as to what our own situation is.

23:37.375 --> 23:42.333
And for that is only you needed a Mother - to show you.

23:42.667 --> 23:45.709
And that's how the Mother came here

23:45.917 --> 23:52.208
on this earth to tell you what's the problem with you, within.

23:52.208 --> 23:58.166
This one is to be accepted. This principle has to be practised.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.458
And you'll be amazed at yourself

24:01.750 --> 24:04.959
how much you have already a knowledge

24:05.250 --> 24:08.375
about yourself and about all the surroundings.

24:08.375 --> 24:13.125
There's nothing so special, nothing so extraordinary,

24:13.333 --> 24:17.625
but only thing is you have to be acceptable to yourself.

24:17.625 --> 24:25.583
I think people are becoming Sahaja Yogis,

24:25.792 --> 24:27.667
but they are not.

24:27.792 --> 24:31.333
They are not Sahaja Yogis but they are trying to become.

24:31.333 --> 24:35.417
On the contrary, they should know that they are Sahaja Yogis

24:35.583 --> 24:37.500
and they don't have to become anything.

24:37.625 --> 24:39.750
Then there's no problem.

24:40.041 --> 24:43.125
But when you have accepted that there is

24:44.333 --> 24:48.333
Sahaja Yoga different, and Sahaja Yogis are different

24:48.625 --> 24:49.917
and you are different,

24:50.125 --> 24:52.834
then how can you become Sahaja Yogis?

24:52.834 --> 25:00.083
The thing is the ignorance, is the ignorance that we have,

25:00.291 --> 25:04.709
that we are behaving like strangers towards each other.

25:04.750 --> 25:09.125
Complete ignorance. We have to know that we are all,

25:09.417 --> 25:11.417
all the same, very much.

25:11.500 --> 25:15.542
There's no need to have any ignorance of any kind.

25:15.959 --> 25:20.333
And when that happens, the problems of the whole world

25:20.625 --> 25:23.125
will be solved without any difficulty.

25:23.834 --> 25:26.500
Today's Puja is a special one

25:26.709 --> 25:30.125
because you are doing the Puja of something

25:30.417 --> 25:32.333
that never went into any transformation,

25:33.333 --> 25:39.250
which was not changed at all; it was just the same,

25:39.542 --> 25:44.417
remained the same, born with the same and is still with the same.

25:44.709 --> 25:48.875
In such a Puja, what do I have to say?

25:49.041 --> 25:51.166
Why anyone has to say?

25:51.166 --> 25:54.917
Nothing. Just be one with yourself.

25:55.125 --> 25:57.333
That's the point we come to

25:57.375 --> 26:00.333
- that we have to be one with ourselves,

26:00.625 --> 26:04.041
and not to get it lost in the words

26:04.250 --> 26:10.917
or in the atmosphere or in the other... our movements of brain.

26:11.083 --> 26:14.458
Because, this is the time when the brain starts moving;

26:14.458 --> 26:19.000
and when it starts moving, it loses its control over himself.

26:19.000 --> 26:25.041
Like a snake - unless and until it is in its own place,

26:25.375 --> 26:26.959
there's no danger;

26:27.583 --> 26:31.417
but as he starts moving, there's a danger to him.

26:31.542 --> 26:35.291
In the same way, we have to know that our mind is

26:35.500 --> 26:40.959
very very difficult and should not go into wrong direction.

26:41.083 --> 26:46.041
For that, we have to do the Primordial Mother's Puja

26:46.250 --> 26:50.625
because we should try to be on the line of Primordial Mother.

26:50.792 --> 26:54.166
We have to keep ourselves Primordial.

26:54.667 --> 26:57.709
We have to work out our Primordial Self,

26:57.917 --> 27:02.500
and not to change ourselves for any rhyme or reason.

27:02.917 --> 27:06.166
This will be the best thing, if we can achieve it.

27:06.291 --> 27:09.542
I'm sure we can, not such a problem.

27:09.834 --> 27:16.709
Only thing is that we are so conscious of being Indians,

27:16.875 --> 27:21.875
being English,  being English, European and all that.

27:22.208 --> 27:24.083
But we are not.

27:24.291 --> 27:28.667
We are just ourselves and that's what we have to achieve

27:28.834 --> 27:34.458
- that Oneness with ourselves.
May God bless you all!
