Actually, I was like a mother to them
from My very childhood.

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:14.624
When My father, mother went to jail,
I was, first time I was about, I think,

00:00:14.624 --> 00:00:20.228
five and a half years of age, so I had all
the keys of the house in My little frock

00:00:20.228 --> 00:00:25.326
thing and I used to carry all the duties
like a grandmother. I never felt lost,

00:00:25.326 --> 00:00:31.191
I mean, My life is on the whole, is very collective
by temperament, I'm extremely collective.

00:00:31.351 --> 00:00:36.701
I can live anywhere, I can sleep anywhere,
I can live in the jungles, I can - I have

00:00:36.701 --> 00:00:42.505
no problems of that, I'm extremely 
collective. I'm not exclusive by temperament

00:00:42.505 --> 00:00:48.137
from very childhood. I was very friendly
with all the people in that area, where we

00:00:48.137 --> 00:00:52.195
were living and My mother was known as
Nirmala's mother, father was known as

00:00:52.195 --> 00:00:56.383
Nirmala's father, so they said, "We have
lost our identity because of Her."

00:00:56.383 --> 00:01:01.198
So, I was a very friendly person. I never
felt lonely and when I'm with Myself,

00:01:01.198 --> 00:01:06.862
I'm never lonely at all. I enjoy Myself
very much. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]
