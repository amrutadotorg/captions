00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.000
May God bless you.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.600
Let us all meditate now.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.920
There is no need for tying up your kundalinis,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.720
there is no need to give yourself bandhan.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.280
There's no need at all to do anything,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.160
if you just come up to that stage just now.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.840
There's no need to raise your hands and tying up your kundalini,

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.160
not necessary.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.960
Nothing is to be done.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.640
Your kundalinis are already tied up.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.360
Assume,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.880
assume that situation,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.120
that's all. That's what you are,

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:52.320
the viras, and not the stupid.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.240
May God bless you all. May God bless you.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.040
Respect yourself, respect.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:10.760
May God bless you all.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.760
There's nothing,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.360
nothing more important to Me

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.960
than to see you rise to that level

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.960
of understanding

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.800
of your own values and worth, and discretion.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.360
You have to become sweet, nice people

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:36.280
but very, very powerful,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.000
that you can control yourself, your tongues and your things;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.480
your control, complete control of yourself.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.240
May God bless you again.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.640
Please meditate.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.280
Close your eyes, close your eyes.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.360
Just close your eyes, put your both the hands towards Me.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.720
Put your attention onto Sahasrara,

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.960
just your attention onto Sahasrara.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.440
You are in My Sahasrara, all of you, just now.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.840
Put your attention to your Sahasrara.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.360
There's no thought, nothing.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.640
Just put your attention to it,

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.560
and just rise up to that point.

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:40.840
There's no drama about it,

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.040
there's nothing artificial

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.800
it's actualization.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.960
All weaknesses are to be left behind.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.400
Let's be strong people of strong values.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.960
With dignity and sobriety....

00:07:28.400 --> 00:07:31.720
Silence, absolute inner silence,

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:33.760
and one need not talk too much.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:41.840
Too much to jabber, to talk frivolously is not your way.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.960
Feel it in your heart,

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:54.800
your own dignity,

00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.320
your own glory,

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:14.520
the serenity of behavior.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:31.360
You are all saints, but saints of very high quality,

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:39.400
of very high quality, not ordinary type.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:32.560
Put your attention to your Sahasrara.

00:11:37.560 --> 00:11:42.960
Any thought coming, say, "Not this, not this, not this."

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.600
May God bless you.
