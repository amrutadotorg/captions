00:01.130 --> 00:03.330
Shri Krishna Puja
Cabella Ligure, Italy

00:03.330 --> 00:04.430
August 16, 1992

00:04.430 --> 00:10.430
Today we have decided to have the puja of
Shri Krishna.

00:10.430 --> 00:23.349
We have many a times done this puja and have
understood the essence of Shri Krishna’s

00:23.349 --> 00:27.329
advent, which was six thousand years back.

00:27.329 --> 00:46.330
And now, what His manifestation was, what
He wanted to be accomplished has to be done

00:46.330 --> 00:50.640
in this Kali Yuga.

00:50.640 --> 01:02.320
As it is, this Kali Yuga is going into a new
realm of Satya Yuga, but in between there

01:02.320 --> 01:15.009
is Krita Yuga where this Brahmachaitanya,
or we can say the all-pervading Power of God’s

01:15.009 --> 01:18.130
love, is going to act.

01:18.130 --> 01:29.200
At this time, what is going to happen with
Shri Krishna’s powers – this is what we

01:29.200 --> 01:31.630
have to see.

01:31.630 --> 01:37.649
Shri Krishna, as I told you, was the incarnation
also of diplomacy.

01:37.649 --> 01:46.709
So He plays around quite a lot, and ultimately
He brings forth the untruth and the falsehood;

01:46.709 --> 01:48.759
but in doing that He judges people.

01:48.759 --> 01:57.109
So it’s very important that Shri Krishna’s
powers of His diplomacy were to be manifesting

01:57.109 --> 02:02.639
at this time, when it is the Last Judgment.

02:02.639 --> 02:16.490
So now whatever we have done wrong before,
whatever karmas which have been done in ignorance

02:16.490 --> 02:24.220
maybe, or maybe deliberately, all of them
will be paid back.

02:24.220 --> 02:32.440
Those punyas which you have done in previous
lives, this life, will be also rewarded.

02:32.440 --> 02:41.100
This is all done through Shri Krishna’s
principles of collectivity, where He collectively

02:41.100 --> 02:44.370
sees the situation.

02:44.370 --> 02:56.580
For example, as I told you last time also
that Columbus luckily went to America; luckily,

02:56.580 --> 03:01.400
so we were saved, otherwise we would not have
been here.

03:01.400 --> 03:10.840
And then these Spanish people, bullfighters,
they went and started fighting the poor, unarmed

03:10.840 --> 03:17.210
people who were just very simple owners of
that land.

03:17.210 --> 03:23.100
But they went and occupied those lands, and
killed every one of them.

03:23.100 --> 03:28.510
So in America you can’t find anyone, no
doubt, but even in South America you have

03:28.510 --> 03:35.920
to go to Colombia or to Bolivia, to great
heights, to see some aboriginals there; otherwise

03:35.920 --> 03:39.470
most of them are finished.

03:39.470 --> 03:44.590
So now in Krita Yuga all these diseases have
started cropping up.

03:44.590 --> 03:52.660
But the best part is the drug addiction.

03:52.660 --> 04:02.230
These drugs are made, for your information,
in Bolivia and in Colombia.

04:02.230 --> 04:10.390
You drove them down there, so now you have
the drugs and very nicely you are very welcoming

04:10.390 --> 04:12.120
them.

04:12.120 --> 04:23.540
People went in Nicaragua to help them and
brought back all these horrible drugs to Washington;

04:23.540 --> 04:29.260
and in every elite society they are just discussing
which is the best drug, where is the sale

04:29.260 --> 04:33.160
on and where should they buy the drugs.

04:33.160 --> 04:39.520
So the all of America is now worried how much
drug they can import, and kill themselves

04:39.520 --> 04:42.090
and destroy themselves.

04:42.090 --> 04:48.250
So this destruction has started from inside.

04:48.250 --> 04:55.100
Then in addition to that, when I went there
first I told them not to indulge into these

04:55.100 --> 05:11.070
Freudian practices but keep to morality, otherwise
you’ll have problems.

05:11.070 --> 05:23.320
So they had first AIDS, secondly now yuppie’s
disease, and all kinds of secret diseases

05:23.320 --> 05:25.900
they have.

05:25.900 --> 05:31.139
Among ten people there would be at least one
person who is suffering from that, and among

05:31.139 --> 05:36.400
twenty people there’ll be at least one person
who must be suffering from schizophrenia.

05:36.400 --> 05:45.480
Because they made every person, every other
country nervous, so now they are getting schizophrenia.

05:45.480 --> 05:50.730
Like this we can see even in England.

05:50.730 --> 06:02.740
Now in England they came to India as traders,
ordinary traders, and plundered us completely,

06:02.740 --> 06:08.900
no doubt, ruled us for three hundred years
– as I say, it’s gracious hospitality

06:08.900 --> 06:16.600
they had – and then they left us in three
pieces.

06:16.600 --> 06:21.340
And now in their own country there are problems,
all kinds.

06:21.340 --> 06:29.510
First of all nobody wants to call themselves
as English; they all call themselves Welsh

06:29.510 --> 06:34.210
or Scots, or specially the Irish.

06:34.210 --> 06:38.870
And there is always a bomb scare in London,
every time, and for our first program also

06:38.870 --> 06:41.639
there was a bomb scare.

06:41.639 --> 06:47.810
So you can imagine these English who tried
to divide us are automatically divided among

06:47.810 --> 06:50.260
themselves, and now fighting each other.

06:50.260 --> 06:56.690
But there are other problems also like AIDS
and immoral life, everything like that.

06:56.690 --> 06:59.020
Same with the French.

06:59.020 --> 07:06.320
French tried to sell their wine all over,
and bring their horrible bathroom culture

07:06.320 --> 07:07.520
everywhere.

07:07.520 --> 07:10.130
Now they are suffering from it.

07:10.130 --> 07:15.919
For example, most of the time they’re drunk
and they have lost all moorings, I mean, they

07:15.919 --> 07:18.310
have no sense left in their heads.

07:18.310 --> 07:24.270
Like a housewife could be a prostitute – allowed
by law.

07:24.270 --> 07:27.120
All such things are happening.

07:27.120 --> 07:32.990
Now they are paying, and the worst that they
are paying, all these countries who think

07:32.990 --> 07:36.530
no end of themselves, are recession.

07:36.530 --> 07:42.630
This is also Shri Krishna’s power, because
He’s Kubera.

07:42.630 --> 07:46.280
He’s the one who is the power of wealth.

07:46.280 --> 07:52.510
He gave lot of wealth to all these countries,
and now they don’t know what to do with

07:52.510 --> 07:53.510
themselves.

07:53.510 --> 07:59.199
We can see in these fifty years how many things
have happened, but specially these twenty

07:59.199 --> 08:01.580
years have been really remarkable.

08:01.580 --> 08:11.860
All over the world you can find out there
has been some sort of a complete change, or

08:11.860 --> 08:13.130
an exposure.

08:13.130 --> 08:24.570
Even in Italy you see every day this Vatican
is here exposed, or some mafia connections

08:24.570 --> 08:30.902
are there, or this what you call, people from
the government are exposed.

08:30.902 --> 08:38.770
I am doing nothing, I’m just sitting here,
but it is working out that way.

08:38.770 --> 08:42.870
Since I have been here I don’t know how
many people have gone to jail, God knows.

08:42.870 --> 08:46.770
(I don’t know if she’s not brought My
throat pastilles.

08:46.770 --> 08:55.000
I had a bath early in the morning, so a little
bit … This is, Shri Krishna is trying to

08:55.000 --> 08:59.380
fill Me up!)

08:59.380 --> 09:16.890
We Indians are also suffering,because our
past deeds – like we had a caste system.

09:16.890 --> 09:21.270
So now the caste system has become the greatest
headache for us in India, that’s the greatest

09:21.270 --> 09:23.370
cancer for us.

09:23.370 --> 09:33.420
Like that, everywhere these twenty years or
twenty-one years have been … ( … I don’t

09:33.420 --> 09:38.210
know, because morning.

09:38.210 --> 09:54.900
Also reaction on Me … ) So like that in
every country, you’ll see gradually, every

09:54.900 --> 10:02.050
country will have to face for what it has
done.

10:02.050 --> 10:12.980
Also Shri Krishna’s own style was that He
can never believed in caste system.

10:12.980 --> 10:22.660
He Himself was born in a caste which is a,
what you call is a milkman’s caste, and

10:22.660 --> 10:29.850
then He became a king, of course; but to begin
with, and He lived like an ordinary person.

10:29.850 --> 10:36.440
He used to take the cows outside, look after
them and bring them home.

10:36.440 --> 10:46.050
Now if you see His life you’ll find He is
absolutely very human, the way He used to

10:46.050 --> 10:48.580
tease His mother, tease other ladies.

10:48.580 --> 10:55.070
All this is extremely human and childlike,
and extremely sweet.

10:55.070 --> 10:59.089
But behind that also there was a great significance.

10:59.089 --> 11:07.290
For example, Shri Radha – as you know, She
was Mahalakshmi – and as Mahalakshmi She

11:07.290 --> 11:14.200
used to put Her feet, take bath in the river
Yamuna, and the ladies would take water from

11:14.200 --> 11:18.270
the same river, carry on their head the pitchers.

11:18.270 --> 11:25.410
Now Shri Krishna wanted to raise their kundalini,
so He used to hit them from the back so that

11:25.410 --> 11:32.170
the water falls on their back, and that vibrated
water would raise their kundalini.

11:32.170 --> 11:36.360
This was His childish trick, but it had a
meaning.

11:36.360 --> 11:42.029
Another one, when we see Him in ras – “ra”
means energy.

11:42.029 --> 11:47.839
Radha: “ra” is “energy,” “dha”
means “the one who sustains it” – so

11:47.839 --> 11:51.720
it is Radhaji who had the energy.

11:51.720 --> 11:59.220
“Sa” means “with,” so when they played
ras, was nothing but to play with the energy.

11:59.220 --> 12:04.700
And that’s how He wanted to have a collective
awakening of people, of gopa and gopis, and

12:04.700 --> 12:06.120
He did it.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.430
But then He had to leave and fight this Kamsa.

12:09.430 --> 12:17.060
In His own lifetime, as a child or grown-up,
He punished all kinds of devils and women

12:17.060 --> 12:21.500
devils who were like Putna, and all that.

12:21.500 --> 12:26.740
He did it, and in this Kali Yuga also He’s
active.

12:26.740 --> 12:33.670
We have seen how gradually He has finished
so many false gurus, one by one; somebody

12:33.670 --> 12:38.769
who called himself Shri Krishna, somebody
who called himself as God, something else,

12:38.769 --> 12:39.769
something else.

12:39.769 --> 12:44.709
He finished them all, exposed them nicely,
and now we have very few people in the arena

12:44.709 --> 12:48.630
left for us to fight.

12:48.630 --> 12:52.310
They themselves are trembling and they are
quite frightened of us, because we are standing

12:52.310 --> 12:56.870
on truth.

12:56.870 --> 13:05.450
So now, when we have to think about Shri Krishna
who is residing in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

13:05.450 --> 13:12.370
Many people have this problem of left Vishuddhi.

13:12.370 --> 13:20.680
That is because we are more sort of very social
people.

13:20.680 --> 13:27.050
Now in the Western society, the social system
is so rigid that anybody can collapse with

13:27.050 --> 13:33.670
that, or used to be; now better because of
the, maybe the revolt, anti-culture.

13:33.670 --> 13:40.399
But otherwise if you could put one spoon from
here to there, then you are finished.

13:40.399 --> 13:46.580
If you start your food with, say, not with
the fish knife but with an ordinary knife,

13:46.580 --> 13:48.990
then you’re finished, you are no good.

13:48.990 --> 13:57.010
And these French have made even much worse
by using a big science out of alcohol.

13:57.010 --> 14:04.350
For this alcohol this is the glass, for that
alcohol that is the glass, and all that.

14:04.350 --> 14:08.320
So the whole collective was made so rigid.

14:08.320 --> 14:10.800
It’s much more rigid than in India.

14:10.800 --> 14:16.550
I used to think Indian collective is quite
rigid because of certain conditionings we

14:16.550 --> 14:28.060
have, but after coming to the West I was surprised
that it is such a conditioning in the heads

14:28.060 --> 14:34.769
of the people, that some of the conditionings
you cannot remove – say from Catholic Church,

14:34.769 --> 14:37.470
you might say, or from wherever it is.

14:37.470 --> 14:45.971
But when it comes from somebody like Freud
who was absolutely a devil, they just give

14:45.971 --> 14:49.760
up all these conditionings and take to that.

14:49.760 --> 14:56.750
I cannot understand any country where there
is Catholic Church so predominant, they are

14:56.750 --> 14:57.940
following Freud.

14:57.940 --> 15:07.630
So this collective rigidity, which was then
because maybe Shri Rama was a very formal

15:07.630 --> 15:14.839
person, because of Him maybe the collective
rigidity might have been in India.

15:14.839 --> 15:21.140
But in the West it is all mental, it’s absolutely
mental.

15:21.140 --> 15:26.890
If you make this kind of hair then you are
all right, if you put oil then you are absolutely

15:26.890 --> 15:34.510
lunatic: all kinds of funny ideas were given,
and people started doing like this.

15:34.510 --> 15:35.940
If you don’t put oil at all you’ll become
bald.

15:35.940 --> 15:40.160
If you become bald, then they will have a
business of their wigs.

15:40.160 --> 15:46.050
So the whole thing was money-oriented, and
everything was made so fixed that you had

15:46.050 --> 15:49.100
to do it so that they could sell their things.

15:49.100 --> 15:54.260
England was, as you know, is tailcoat: you
have to wear a tailcoat if you have to see

15:54.260 --> 15:55.260
the Queen.

15:55.260 --> 16:00.850
I don’t know why you have to wear a tailcoat
to see the Queen, but it’s compulsory, and

16:00.850 --> 16:03.760
if you don’t wear then you are not allowed.

16:03.760 --> 16:08.601
So they have to borrow these tailcoats and
all that from one shop, which can be tight,

16:08.601 --> 16:15.380
which can be loose, and everybody looks like
Charlie Chaplin to Me!

16:15.380 --> 16:18.810
They can’t walk straight.

16:18.810 --> 16:31.550
So this kind of stupid rigidity that came
into the West has really made them very nervous.

16:31.550 --> 16:33.010
People are so nervous here.

16:33.010 --> 16:42.089
If you tell some lady that “I am going to
come and have food with you,” she will collapse.

16:42.089 --> 16:48.639
God knows what she thinks, I mean, it is caring
for the public opinion, or her own conditioning.

16:48.639 --> 16:55.110
But in an Indian, a housewife, if you tell
her you are going to come, she’ll be the

16:55.110 --> 16:56.540
happiest person.

16:56.540 --> 17:01.170
She’ll be very happy that you are coming
to her house for dinner.

17:01.170 --> 17:05.670
But here even if you say, “I would like
to come and see you in the evening,” they’ll

17:05.670 --> 17:07.800
say, “All right, come in the pub.”

17:07.800 --> 17:15.250
Because they’re so nervous, they’re not
sure of themself; and this has come, I think,

17:15.250 --> 17:18.790
perhaps from these norms that there have been
created in the West.

17:18.790 --> 17:27.750
In India also we had lots of these ritualism
that came up very serious.

17:27.750 --> 17:36.320
Like we had people, Jainis who’d pick up
their hair with their hands.

17:36.320 --> 17:47.840
They are not supposed to use any knives or
any scissors or any barbers, so they were

17:47.840 --> 17:49.910
supposed to pick up their hair on their own.

17:49.910 --> 17:55.320
So from their beard, from their this thing,
they would pick up all the time.

17:55.320 --> 18:02.700
That went to such a horrible conditioning
that they would say that if you, even if you

18:02.700 --> 18:07.669
breathe then you can, you might consume some
animals.

18:07.669 --> 18:12.730
So they would put some sort of a cloth before
their mouth, and all kinds of nonsense they

18:12.730 --> 18:14.140
did.

18:14.140 --> 18:18.840
At that time Shri Krishna came in.

18:18.840 --> 18:25.770
His own cousin was a tirthankara, you’ll
be surprised, Neminath.

18:25.770 --> 18:34.700
He became a tirthankara, and that made Shri
Krishna think about it, that this kind of

18:34.700 --> 18:36.970
stupid ritualism that we have.

18:36.970 --> 18:42.560
Like in the morning women will get up, in
their sleep they will go, put some water for

18:42.560 --> 18:46.730
tulsi, do this thing, that thing, throw water
here and there.

18:46.730 --> 18:52.790
And also the untouchables and touchables;
and you can’t take water from this, you

18:52.790 --> 19:00.460
can’t eat this, you can’t move like that
– all kinds of restrictions, timing, everything.

19:00.460 --> 19:04.460
This time is not good, that time is not good,
this you should not do, that you should not

19:04.460 --> 19:15.720
do, to such an extent that the whole movement
of our country was round these rituals.

19:15.720 --> 19:19.780
I had nephews who used to come to Bombay for
their work.

19:19.780 --> 19:22.940
Every time they went to Lucknow, they would
come with shaven heads.

19:22.940 --> 19:24.770
I said, “What’s the matter?”

19:24.770 --> 19:28.400
He said, “There are many people in our family
who are old, and when they die we have to

19:28.400 --> 19:29.400
shave our heads.”

19:29.400 --> 19:34.460
So every time they went there somebody died,
so they came with shaven heads.

19:34.460 --> 19:40.780
Like that such horrible rituals existed, and
even now in the South India there is a lot

19:40.780 --> 19:45.640
of rituals are there, terrible rituals, and
they cannot get out of it, they’re frightened.

19:45.640 --> 19:53.120
If they get out of it then they might be sinners,
or they will go to hell.

19:53.120 --> 20:01.330
So the Indian conditioning was, as far as
these rigidities were concerned for religion,

20:01.330 --> 20:09.510
to be on the right side in such a way that
we should not be caught up without doing this.

20:09.510 --> 20:14.470
So early in the morning they’ll get up and
do the rituals, just without even thinking

20:14.470 --> 20:19.070
about what they’re doing.

20:19.070 --> 20:25.420
But in the West the lifestyle is nothing but
rigidity, the whole lifestyle is; there’s

20:25.420 --> 20:27.040
no freedom anywhere.

20:27.040 --> 20:32.860
And all that then was rewarded by these hippies
and other people, and all of them, and they

20:32.860 --> 20:37.040
fought it, and that thing went to another
extremes.

20:37.040 --> 20:42.080
So from one extreme to another extreme they
went.

20:42.080 --> 20:48.440
Now, how Shri Krishna’s advent changed it.

20:48.440 --> 20:59.470
When Shri Krishna came on this Earth, He said
this is all a leela, it is just a play.

20:59.470 --> 21:04.460
Because you are involved into it, you cannot
see the play.

21:04.460 --> 21:12.299
But if you ascend – if you are in the water
you are afraid of the water, but if you get

21:12.299 --> 21:19.540
into the boat you can see the water, and if
you know how to swim you can even save the

21:19.540 --> 21:22.210
people who are in the water.

21:22.210 --> 21:31.100
So He says that if you develop a witness state,
sakshi swarupata, if you develop that state

21:31.100 --> 21:34.600
then you see the whole thing as a drama.

21:34.600 --> 21:36.630
Nothing affects you.

21:36.630 --> 21:43.320
Nothing matters, you don’t worry about anything,
you see the problem above; you are, and you

21:43.320 --> 21:47.240
see the problem, and because you are out of
it, you can solve the problem.

21:47.240 --> 21:56.590
This was His great advent, I would say, that
has taught the first step towards the ascent,

21:56.590 --> 21:59.809
is that you have to become a sakshi.

21:59.809 --> 22:02.309
You have to become the witness.

22:02.309 --> 22:07.350
Now let’s see in Sahaja Yoga.

22:07.350 --> 22:14.000
In Sahaja Yoga there are different types of
people come from different areas, from different

22:14.000 --> 22:18.809
cultures, because the door is open to everyone.

22:18.809 --> 22:28.080
Now if an Indian comes in, he will be all
the time watchful about others, and will say

22:28.080 --> 22:33.070
that “Mother, this man is not doing this,
this man is not doing that.

22:33.070 --> 22:35.260
He should have done footsoaking.”

22:35.260 --> 22:42.539
He’ll find faults with others, all the time
saying that this man is not doing like this,

22:42.539 --> 22:44.280
and you know.

22:44.280 --> 22:48.940
But in the West they start finding faults
with themselves.

22:48.940 --> 22:55.390
And I receive letters, ten to twelve pages
sometimes, confessing what wrong they have

22:55.390 --> 22:56.390
done.

22:56.390 --> 23:01.470
Who is interested to know, what wrongs you
have done?

23:01.470 --> 23:11.380
I mean, if a lotus is born, nobody wants to
know how many filthy things are inside the

23:11.380 --> 23:12.380
pond.

23:12.380 --> 23:15.590
You are now a lotus.

23:15.590 --> 23:22.720
But it’s so common that they think we must
confess, we must tell Mother what wrong we

23:22.720 --> 23:23.720
have done.

23:23.720 --> 23:27.110
Every moment you are changing, so what is
there to confess?

23:27.110 --> 23:35.260
And the life is so formal, as I told you,
that people suffer from guilt for anything.

23:35.260 --> 23:43.159
Apart from the influence of this Catholic
Church has conditioned you so much that even

23:43.159 --> 23:48.090
if you are not a Catholic, you’re a Protestant,
still you have guilt, and as a guilt you develop

23:48.090 --> 23:50.630
this left Vishuddhi.

23:50.630 --> 23:58.150
So then this left Vishuddhi is Vishnumaya
– means what?

23:58.150 --> 24:05.620
Once you have this left Vishuddhi you develop
all the problems of the Vishnumaya, and one

24:05.620 --> 24:08.880
of them is the heart.

24:08.880 --> 24:17.500
Because Vishnumaya is an active thing, She
is like electricity; and if you have Vishnumaya

24:17.500 --> 24:20.860
problem, then you become lethargic.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.500
“Oh, I’m so guilty.”

24:23.500 --> 24:24.500
You become depressed.

24:24.500 --> 24:28.470
That Vishnumaya Principle disappears from
you.

24:28.470 --> 24:37.520
She’s the one who’s quick, fast, and She
gives the light, and announces to the whole

24:37.520 --> 24:40.450
world what Shri Krishna is.

24:40.450 --> 24:47.050
While what happens with such people, Sahaja
yogis who come in, who feel guilty, they say,

24:47.050 --> 24:52.980
“Mother, You know, we thought that if we
do this then our ego will come up.

24:52.980 --> 25:00.370
If we do any work outside and work in some
fields or in some villages, then our ego will

25:00.370 --> 25:01.370
come up.

25:01.370 --> 25:04.490
So we don’t want to do it.”

25:04.490 --> 25:05.870
This is absurd.

25:05.870 --> 25:11.580
It’s like you give light to some light,
and the light says that “I don’t want

25:11.580 --> 25:19.179
to give the light, because maybe this light
might develop an ego.”

25:19.179 --> 25:20.179
It is absurd.

25:20.179 --> 25:25.980
But such absurd things Sahaja yogis tell Me.

25:25.980 --> 25:32.559
For them one has to understand, to get out
of this left Vishuddhi is to become absolutely

25:32.559 --> 25:39.440
dynamic in Sahaja Yoga, go all out into Sahaja
Yoga.

25:39.440 --> 25:42.669
Otherwise they can’t get rid of their left
Vishuddhis.

25:42.669 --> 25:53.300
Left Vishuddhi is a thing that’s a very
depressive action on the whole being, and

25:53.300 --> 26:00.620
a person who has left Vishuddhi is always
a very slow person to do anything for Sahaja

26:00.620 --> 26:01.620
Yoga.

26:01.620 --> 26:04.190
You have not been given light to hide it.

26:04.190 --> 26:10.520
Christ has said that you don’t put light
under the table.

26:10.520 --> 26:17.390
So you have been given light to work it out,
to be dynamic, to think what to do, how to

26:17.390 --> 26:19.510
arrange, how to organize.

26:19.510 --> 26:24.940
But if you are guilty, then you will all the
time say, “Oh Mother, it’s very difficult,

26:24.940 --> 26:31.120
You know, this . . .” Always you’ll find
the other side of the whole joke, just to

26:31.120 --> 26:32.120
avoid.

26:32.120 --> 26:35.470
Now for a Sahaja yogi is to witness himself,
first of all.

26:35.470 --> 26:36.820
That is the introspection.

26:36.820 --> 26:41.990
He should see for himself, “Where was I,
and I have come here.”

26:41.990 --> 26:46.940
Don’t indulge too much in the past, but
see the distance you have crossed in such

26:46.940 --> 26:49.350
a short time.

26:49.350 --> 26:54.200
Now you have come into the Kingdom of God,
you have all the powers.

26:54.200 --> 26:56.700
I don’t tell lies – it’s a fact.

26:56.700 --> 27:03.679
I’ll give you an example, if Wolfgang allows
Me to say that.

27:03.679 --> 27:14.919
Wolfgang was with Me when we were traveling
from Prague to Vienna and the plane, you see,

27:14.919 --> 27:18.429
he told Me that the plane is at ten-thirty,
but it was at nine-thirty; it was a mistake.

27:18.429 --> 27:22.900
It’s all right, there can be mistake, of
course, that also is Shri Krishna’s style.

27:22.900 --> 27:26.799
You can always do mistakes, doesn’t matter.

27:26.799 --> 27:33.600
So we reached – I mean, why all these things
happen, see, to create an event, a ghatna.

27:33.600 --> 27:39.390
So he was very upset about it that he told
Me a wrong time, and I reached there about

27:39.390 --> 27:40.440
fifteen minutes late.

27:40.440 --> 27:45.250
And there was a ground hostess, horrible,
she started shouting at Me, saying all kinds,

27:45.250 --> 27:48.580
“It’s not fair, You don’t know,” this,
that and everything.

27:48.580 --> 27:54.900
I just didn’t bother about it because I
knew that it was out of mistake we’ve done

27:54.900 --> 27:55.900
it.

27:55.900 --> 27:58.730
And they could have taken away their plane
instead of shouting, but they kept the plane

27:58.730 --> 28:06.700
and shouted at Me, because she wanted to shout,
you see.

28:06.700 --> 28:17.020
Then the plane was filled in with people and
it would not leave, so I asked the engineers.

28:17.020 --> 28:19.039
They said, “It has been like this for the
half-an-hour.

28:19.039 --> 28:20.850
We are trying to correct it.

28:20.850 --> 28:22.110
It’s like this.”

28:22.110 --> 28:23.800
So it’s all right.

28:23.800 --> 28:31.480
He said that “We’ll have to wait till
we put it right.”

28:31.480 --> 28:37.960
But because she shouted at Me, Wolfgang was
full of tears, you see; just look at this

28:37.960 --> 28:40.659
German having so many tears in his eyes!

28:40.659 --> 28:44.610
Then Alga was telling him that “It’s all
right, doesn’t matter.

28:44.610 --> 28:46.429
It’s not your mistake.”

28:46.429 --> 28:51.980
He was feeling so sad that Mother has been
insulted like this by this lady, because of

28:51.980 --> 28:54.309
my mistake – I mean, it’s love.

28:54.309 --> 28:56.970
Now the power of his love was so great.

28:56.970 --> 29:02.029
At the same moment there were so many, to
about fifty people, Sahaja yogis standing

29:02.029 --> 29:03.770
on the balcony watching us.

29:03.770 --> 29:11.980
We also felt and they also felt, but they
felt a tremendous cool breeze like a big blow

29:11.980 --> 29:17.669
came to them and blew upon them vibrations,
and they just got enamored.

29:17.669 --> 29:22.100
And suddenly when they opened their eyes what
they find, the whole sky was filled with clouds.

29:22.100 --> 29:24.380
There was not a single cloud.

29:24.380 --> 29:29.419
In one second, in one second from where the
clouds came, God knows.

29:29.419 --> 29:31.799
It was all completely filled with them.

29:31.799 --> 29:36.049
Then they asked us to get out because they
could not do anything.

29:36.049 --> 29:39.220
So when we came back it started raining.

29:39.220 --> 29:42.140
When we came in, he got after that lady.

29:42.140 --> 29:44.400
He said, “Now, whom are we to shout?

29:44.400 --> 29:47.090
We can’t catch our planes now.”

29:47.090 --> 29:52.510
And then they announced that all the flights
are cancelled.

29:52.510 --> 29:58.970
So see the power of his love for his Mother
that the whole sky couldn’t bear it, you

29:58.970 --> 30:02.179
see, the, his eyes became the sky.

30:02.179 --> 30:07.730
And in a second they said, “Mother, we have
never seen such a miracle, that there is not

30:07.730 --> 30:12.780
one single thing and the whole thing was filled
with this.”

30:12.780 --> 30:16.140
So you must know your powers.

30:16.140 --> 30:20.159
That is what is – first of all witness yourself,
is the introspection.

30:20.159 --> 30:25.330
See for yourself how many powers you have
got.

30:25.330 --> 30:31.070
Now with your left Vishuddhi you will always
conclude, “Oh, how can I have any powers?

30:31.070 --> 30:35.440
After all, I have done this, I have done that.”

30:35.440 --> 30:41.730
Even if you give somebody hundred pounds and
you tell him that now you go to the market,

30:41.730 --> 30:47.850
buy something, he’ll say, “Oh, what’s
the use of this hundred pounds?” this, that.

30:47.850 --> 30:49.299
Use it!

30:49.299 --> 30:50.900
As simple as that.

30:50.900 --> 30:56.020
But then Sahaja yogis start saying that “No,
no, no, no.

30:56.020 --> 30:57.700
Mother says, but how can I have?

30:57.700 --> 31:00.590
How can I have these powers, after all?

31:00.590 --> 31:01.870
It’s not possible.

31:01.870 --> 31:03.159
I’m no good.”

31:03.159 --> 31:08.080
Because that left Vishuddhi’s all the time
telling that you are good for nothing.

31:08.080 --> 31:18.010
It’s like a leaking hole in your brain that
takes away all the sense, and you accept it.

31:18.010 --> 31:24.190
So first thing is to introspect yourself,
and see for yourself how many powers you have

31:24.190 --> 31:25.190
got.

31:25.190 --> 31:30.480
Like in the beginning no Sahaja yogi would
give realization, in India.

31:30.480 --> 31:33.230
Nobody would even touch anyone.

31:33.230 --> 31:39.200
It so happened that My car failed and I was
late two hours, luckily, and there was a big

31:39.200 --> 31:42.559
meeting and they didn’t know what to do,
so they started giving realization to people.

31:42.559 --> 31:49.570
And then they realized they can give realization;
otherwise they would not touch anyone.

31:49.570 --> 31:52.779
Now you know that what you can do.

31:52.779 --> 31:56.559
You also know that whatever you say happens.

31:56.559 --> 31:57.559
Whatever you want you can get it.

31:57.559 --> 31:58.559
Try, try, try!

31:58.559 --> 32:03.870
But if you don’t do it, then you’ll be
all the time half-baked.

32:03.870 --> 32:09.659
Take the experience of your powers, see how
dynamic you are.

32:09.659 --> 32:15.150
Don’t have formalities about it, just use
it fully, and you will be amazed that you

32:15.150 --> 32:17.909
have so many powers.

32:17.909 --> 32:20.800
Somebody told Me that “Mother, You have
given a siddhi to Guido.”

32:20.800 --> 32:23.929
I have given siddhi to all of you.

32:23.929 --> 32:28.140
I never discriminate; but it’s only he is
very brave, he’s used it left and right.

32:28.140 --> 32:30.539
He uses left and right.

32:30.539 --> 32:33.299
If you do not use your siddhis, what can I
do?

32:33.299 --> 32:39.200
I’ve given you all the siddhis, no doubt
about it, so try.

32:39.200 --> 32:43.159
Like in the beginning Baba Mama told Me that
“How can I write a poem?

32:43.159 --> 32:47.990
I feel like writing but I am rather frightened,
because I could not even write an essay.”

32:47.990 --> 32:54.440
I used to write essay for all My brothers,
you see, when they were studying.

32:54.440 --> 32:57.919
I was very good at languages.

32:57.919 --> 32:59.919
But that’s what he said, and now look at
him!

32:59.919 --> 33:02.649
I told him, “You go ahead and write whatever
you write.”

33:02.649 --> 33:05.180
He said, “I may write something wrong.”

33:05.180 --> 33:06.440
“It doesn’t matter.

33:06.440 --> 33:07.440
Write it.”

33:07.440 --> 33:12.360
In the same way, somebody wants to paint something,
one should not think how they will criticize

33:12.360 --> 33:16.900
or anything – just paint.

33:16.900 --> 33:18.120
If you want to sing, just sing.

33:18.120 --> 33:23.000
If you want to do anything, any manifestation,
just do it boldly.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.560
Go in a big way.

33:24.560 --> 33:28.309
You’ll be amazed at yourself how you have
achieved it and how you are doing it.

33:28.309 --> 33:31.730
It has worked with so many artists, you know
that.

33:31.730 --> 33:37.340
That day Debu told you about himself, and
in so many they can tell you that this has

33:37.340 --> 33:38.600
happened to them.

33:38.600 --> 33:41.659
So now the first thing is to know that you
have powers.

33:41.659 --> 33:43.150
Now believe in them.

33:43.150 --> 33:44.200
Have faith in yourself.

33:44.200 --> 33:49.279
If you have left Vishuddhi, this Vishnumaya
won’t work out.

33:49.279 --> 33:51.600
But be like Vishnumaya.

33:51.600 --> 33:53.540
Just give up this guilt.

33:53.540 --> 33:56.029
“No, I am a Sahaja yogi.

33:56.029 --> 33:58.480
I’m not an ordinary person.”

33:58.480 --> 34:03.120
People sometimes talk to Me and I say, “Do
you know what you are?”

34:03.120 --> 34:04.120
“What, Mother?”

34:04.120 --> 34:06.330
“You are a Sahaja yogi.”

34:06.330 --> 34:09.389
“Oh, I forgot.”

34:09.389 --> 34:14.489
“Now go and do it.”

34:14.489 --> 34:22.279
And the another style of this left Vishuddhi
is this, which one must understand, that it

34:22.279 --> 34:24.019
tries to give an explanation.

34:24.019 --> 34:28.460
As I told you many a time, you tell somebody
that telephone to someone.

34:28.460 --> 34:31.649
First they will say, “He may not be there,
Mother.”

34:31.649 --> 34:32.899
“Baba, you telephone!

34:32.899 --> 34:38.690
First find out if he may be there or may not
be there.”

34:38.690 --> 34:40.829
But they would not.

34:40.829 --> 34:44.139
They would just avoid, and that is another
thing.

34:44.139 --> 34:46.899
Vishnumaya never avoids, you have seen that.

34:46.899 --> 34:52.450
Once She has to shine She shines, wherever
She is, whatever She is.

34:52.450 --> 34:55.280
So in the same way we have to be like that.

34:55.280 --> 35:01.739
We have to know that we are special people,
we are chosen, we are angelic and that we

35:01.739 --> 35:06.430
have entered into the Kingdom of God, and
it will all work out.

35:06.430 --> 35:09.400
Sahaja Yoga is not meant for useless people.

35:09.400 --> 35:14.859
As I told you, in Marathi, Tukaram has said,
“Yeddya gabalyache kam nave.”

35:14.859 --> 35:17.839
It’s not meant for lunatics and lousy people.

35:17.839 --> 35:22.259
It’s meant for somebody who has tyala pahijet
jatiche.

35:22.259 --> 35:24.579
You need people of character.

35:24.579 --> 35:31.500
I know that there cannot be many like that,
but there is no place in God’s realm for

35:31.500 --> 35:34.940
many people, for all these useless people.

35:34.940 --> 35:38.219
It’s only for something special.

35:38.219 --> 35:42.690
These seats are reserved and you have got
your realization now, somehow.

35:42.690 --> 35:48.740
So now try to understand that this Vishnumaya
Principle has to be expressed and has to be

35:48.740 --> 35:52.459
shown, and you introspect yourself: have I
done that or not?

35:52.459 --> 35:57.000
Don’t be afraid that they say that “But
our ego will come up.”

35:57.000 --> 35:58.000
Doesn’t matter.

35:58.000 --> 36:00.760
You will also see your ego.

36:00.760 --> 36:07.390
This is the second part of Shri Krishna’s
play, that in this Krita Yuga you see your

36:07.390 --> 36:08.390
ego.

36:08.390 --> 36:15.089
There was a lady who was rather not very kind
to some Maharashtrian ladies.

36:15.089 --> 36:17.910
So I told her, “You have got right side.”

36:17.910 --> 36:18.910
She wouldn’t believe.

36:18.910 --> 36:24.549
She came to see Me in Rome, and she fell down
on right side, completely.

36:24.549 --> 36:30.009
Then she realized that her right side was
not all right.

36:30.009 --> 36:36.039
So to know that, whether you have a right
or a left, there’s a very good method, is

36:36.039 --> 36:37.039
of meditation.

36:37.039 --> 36:45.049
Now the third situation is that you must accept
whatever is wrong with you.

36:45.049 --> 36:50.460
If you do not accept, then you have not been
kind to yourself.

36:50.460 --> 36:56.859
That is the central part of it, that you must
accept, “Yes, this is something wrong with

36:56.859 --> 36:57.859
me.

36:57.859 --> 37:03.569
I have gone in this part I’m wrong, of my
Vishuddhi, or that part I’m wrong.

37:03.569 --> 37:06.069
So now I have to improve.”

37:06.069 --> 37:11.430
Now, right Vishuddhi people will always try
to correct Me.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.430
I’ve seen it.

37:12.430 --> 37:14.609
It’s very simple for them.

37:14.609 --> 37:16.799
If I say anything, “No.”

37:16.799 --> 37:17.799
First words.

37:17.799 --> 37:19.609
Different types “no’s” there are.

37:19.609 --> 37:20.619
Sometimes, “No!”

37:20.619 --> 37:31.150
Sometimes it is “No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no, no!”

37:31.150 --> 37:41.059
They will contradict Me or try to put their
own idea, and then they discover that it was

37:41.059 --> 37:43.459
wrong; they should not have said it.

37:43.459 --> 37:48.950
Say for example, if I say, “I saw these
things lying here.”

37:48.950 --> 37:50.279
They said, “No.”

37:50.279 --> 37:57.150
I said, “I saw with My own eyes and once
I see something, you know, it’s registers,

37:57.150 --> 37:58.170
it’s there.”

37:58.170 --> 37:59.170
“No.”

37:59.170 --> 38:01.349
I say, “All right, just try to find out.”

38:01.349 --> 38:02.349
“It’s there.

38:02.349 --> 38:05.359
How is it we didn’t see?”

38:05.359 --> 38:10.849
I said, “Because your ‘no’ was written
on your eyes, I think, you couldn’t see

38:10.849 --> 38:11.849
anything.”

38:11.849 --> 38:16.940
And then they’ll pull their ears – that’s
the best.

38:16.940 --> 38:22.890
But if you see that “This is a habit I have
of saying no to things.”

38:22.890 --> 38:27.079
So first of all, I also test you.

38:27.079 --> 38:31.819
Supposing I say it is just now nine o’clock
in the night, you just say yes; let’s see

38:31.819 --> 38:33.050
what happens.

38:33.050 --> 38:34.900
Try to see.

38:34.900 --> 38:45.000
You see, I test you many a times like this
and then I see that some people – if I say

38:45.000 --> 38:49.799
so, all right, if it’s so, if Mother has
said, it is so.

38:49.799 --> 38:53.959
And then it starts building up their faith
very well.

38:53.959 --> 39:06.380
I can see they’re, clearly how they are
coming into the realm of real faith, and there

39:06.380 --> 39:08.660
when I say something absurd they’ll just
smile.

39:08.660 --> 39:14.579
They know it is Mother is just testing us,
you see, so they just smile.

39:14.579 --> 39:18.480
They wouldn’t do anything, but they’ll
just smile.

39:18.480 --> 39:23.950
And then if it is so and if they don’t know,
they’ll say, “Yes, it must be.

39:23.950 --> 39:27.410
Mother must have done this or said so.”

39:27.410 --> 39:30.079
So your testing time is there.

39:30.079 --> 39:31.589
You have to test yourself.

39:31.589 --> 39:36.789
As Mohammed Sahib has said, that your hands
will speak and they’ll give witness against

39:36.789 --> 39:39.979
you – so on your hands you will know.

39:39.979 --> 39:44.809
Now these hands are the blessings of Shri
Krishna.

39:44.809 --> 39:51.959
They come out from the same Vishuddhi, and
as you know the pelvic nerves serves it on

39:51.959 --> 39:52.959
all that.

39:52.959 --> 40:00.209
And there are two chakras of one Lalita, another
Shri Chakras, all on these both sides; they

40:00.209 --> 40:02.960
also play into the hands of Shri Krishna.

40:02.960 --> 40:07.819
With these hands we can feel the vibrations.

40:07.819 --> 40:13.089
Now if your right Vishuddhi’s too strong
you may not feel, if your left Vishuddhi’s

40:13.089 --> 40:19.720
too strong you may not feel, but that doesn’t
mean that you haven’t got realization.

40:19.720 --> 40:20.720
You have got.

40:20.720 --> 40:23.029
You just work out your hands.

40:23.029 --> 40:29.300
Now for working your hands, you have to see
that you don’t use them for useless things.

40:29.300 --> 40:34.359
That’s very important, because you have
special hands.

40:34.359 --> 40:41.140
These hands are the ones with which you spread
the collectivity.

40:41.140 --> 40:52.319
Now for example, Italy example this: here
the people when they talk, they’ll go on

40:52.319 --> 40:56.690
… They don’t know anything what they are
saying, they only know their own, all their

40:56.690 --> 40:59.119
gestures, and they only can depict.

40:59.119 --> 41:05.420
For a person who doesn’t know them, on they’ll
go on like this, like this, all the time.

41:05.420 --> 41:06.760
So this should be reduced.

41:06.760 --> 41:11.400
There’s no need to use your hands so much
all the time, like this, like that.

41:11.400 --> 41:16.859
Little bit, but while using the hands also
it should be decent, it should be regulated,

41:16.859 --> 41:26.119
it should be
very indicative and useful.

41:26.119 --> 41:30.109
Just showing off your hands is not good.

41:30.109 --> 41:35.349
It is some sort of a theory came out, I was
told, that you must put your gestures into

41:35.349 --> 41:37.789
your hands and speak.

41:37.789 --> 41:40.710
Is all right for people like Hitler, but not
for us.

41:40.710 --> 41:42.859
For us we should be decent.

41:42.859 --> 41:46.589
We should, whenever we have to say – now
for example, you want to point out something

41:46.589 --> 41:48.190
to someone, shouldn’t say “do this.”

41:48.190 --> 41:51.839
This is Shri Krishna’s finger, you can’t
use it like that.

41:51.839 --> 41:57.660
Let them do, means supporting everything.

41:57.660 --> 42:00.579
This looks better.

42:00.579 --> 42:02.630
These hands are to be used for collectivity.

42:02.630 --> 42:06.759
See, we say “namaste” when we meet others.

42:06.759 --> 42:09.630
To thousands of people we can say “namaste.”

42:09.630 --> 42:14.049
But I don’t like the shaking hands business
because it’s no good.

42:14.049 --> 42:16.170
Shaking hands doesn’t create any collectivity.

42:16.170 --> 42:20.519
On the contrary, you might get all kinds of
pins and needles and all kinds of problems

42:20.519 --> 42:22.239
from others.

42:22.239 --> 42:30.700
But when you talk to people also, with these
hands only you can feel them; with these hands

42:30.700 --> 42:38.539
only you can care for your children; with
these hands only you can suggest your softness,

42:38.539 --> 42:45.619
your sweetness, and also with the mouth – which
is of course is a part of the Vishuddhi, that’s

42:45.619 --> 42:48.430
different – but specially hands.

42:48.430 --> 42:58.210
Your gestures and everything should show very
heartfelt emotions, and then only these gestures

42:58.210 --> 43:00.630
have some meaning.

43:00.630 --> 43:04.690
Now in Sahaja Yoga as you know, you hold each
other’s hands and the vibration starts flowing

43:04.690 --> 43:06.440
among yourselves.

43:06.440 --> 43:15.240
And you can also hear the tabla on your throbbings,
so that shows that they are the communication.

43:15.240 --> 43:21.430
So these hands, which are really the beginning
of the collectivity – most important, I

43:21.430 --> 43:29.999
would say the most important things are the
hands, which act for your collectivity.

43:29.999 --> 43:38.200
As far as you are concerned there are many
other angels and other ganas who are standing

43:38.200 --> 43:39.249
behind you.

43:39.249 --> 43:46.180
They also, they extend their help to you whenever
you want to communicate something, they also

43:46.180 --> 43:48.230
do your jobs very well.

43:48.230 --> 43:58.089
So whatever is expressed in your hand or through
your hand, they immediately pick up.

43:58.089 --> 44:08.650
As you know that Vishuddhi has sixteen petals,
and all ear, nose, throat, eyes, all are guided

44:08.650 --> 44:10.249
by this.

44:10.249 --> 44:17.319
Also the sub-plexus of this Vishuddhi is this
one, is the Hamsa Chakra.

44:17.319 --> 44:23.910
So we have these eyes to see, eyes to communicate.

44:23.910 --> 44:31.309
The pure eyes communicate pure love, purity.

44:31.309 --> 44:39.619
With the pure eyes you can cleanse people,
with the pure eyes you can help others, you

44:39.619 --> 44:41.869
can bring peace.

44:41.869 --> 44:46.589
The purification of the eyes takes place through
your Vishuddhi and Agnya.

44:46.589 --> 44:51.309
Here both things have to work out.

44:51.309 --> 44:55.219
The nose is very important.

44:55.219 --> 45:05.019
Nose has to be pure, in the sense that you
should be able to discard whatever is smelling

45:05.019 --> 45:09.740
badly, and you should be able to accept whatever
is fragrant.

45:09.740 --> 45:17.989
It’s very important, because nose is the
speciality of Shri Krishna, I would say, in

45:17.989 --> 45:25.680
the sense that He’s the Kubera, and the
Kubera has given the nose to the Goddess.

45:25.680 --> 45:36.130
Some people have a bad habit of moving their
nose just to show disapproval or something

45:36.130 --> 45:37.719
like this, they go on doing like that.

45:37.719 --> 45:45.380
This is very wrong, because then you are insulting
yourself, you’re insulting your Kubera power.

45:45.380 --> 45:48.579
So you have to keep your nose in a dignified
manner.

45:48.579 --> 45:51.380
It should be a dignified nose.

45:51.380 --> 45:57.800
It should not be used for doing something
which is undignified, or which expresses contempt.

45:57.800 --> 46:01.569
Then your teeth are very important.

46:01.569 --> 46:09.849
You have thirty-two teeth, see: sixteen of
Krishna’s powers divided into, you can say,

46:09.849 --> 46:10.849
thirty-two.

46:10.849 --> 46:17.390
These are your teeth on both the sides.

46:17.390 --> 46:22.209
The right side is on top and the left down
below.

46:22.209 --> 46:25.349
That is one thing we neglect very much in
the West, I must say.

46:25.349 --> 46:26.430
In India it is not.

46:26.430 --> 46:31.289
It is very much we neglect, and that’s what
we have to look after.

46:31.289 --> 46:41.630
The reason for neglect is that, I would say,
is laziness, must be the laziness, but at

46:41.630 --> 46:45.770
least twice or thrice you must brush your
teeth.

46:45.770 --> 46:53.250
Is important, that I need not say, but more
important is to change the brush.

46:53.250 --> 47:03.249
Also you have to use butter, or salt and oil
to rub your gums.

47:03.249 --> 47:11.549
If you rub your gums properly, you will never
have problems with your teeth and your gums.

47:11.549 --> 47:17.339
Moreover, every time in the evening you must
again brush your teeth.

47:17.339 --> 47:21.720
I’ve seen many people who come to Me in
the evening in the program, such a horrible

47:21.720 --> 47:23.530
smell from their mouth comes out.

47:23.530 --> 47:28.469
It is not that it’s a disease but it is,
only thing is that they have not cleansed

47:28.469 --> 47:30.069
their teeth.

47:30.069 --> 47:34.549
Also there are people who will not even brush
their teeth, and start eating breakfast.

47:34.549 --> 47:39.319
I don’t know, it was another theory started,
I think, that you can eat your food without

47:39.319 --> 47:40.329
brushing.

47:40.329 --> 47:45.339
Teeth are very important, and one must look
after them.

47:45.339 --> 47:55.499
On the teeth it depends all the qualities
of your Vishuddhi.

47:55.499 --> 48:04.579
So one has to look after the teeth in a proper
way, and should never clench and never show

48:04.579 --> 48:06.950
temper with the teeth.

48:06.950 --> 48:07.950
It’s a very bad habit.

48:07.950 --> 48:11.079
Also here is a gesture I have seen that if
they don’t like something, they just go

48:11.079 --> 48:12.119
on like this.

48:12.119 --> 48:14.670
It’s a very wrong thing.

48:14.670 --> 48:23.430
One should avoid that kind of a gesture, and
it’s very dangerous for your teeth.

48:23.430 --> 48:32.460
So today’s lecture is more sort of medical,
I must say.

48:32.460 --> 48:48.119
A person who is spiritually endowed has an
expression which can never be aggressive.

48:48.119 --> 48:56.269
He may not be good-looking, may not be very,
a sort of a attractive personality, but the

48:56.269 --> 49:02.650
expression on the face is absolutely saintly.

49:02.650 --> 49:07.730
That is also the blessings of Shri Krishna.

49:07.730 --> 49:20.680
I have seen people after one year of realization,
and I was surprised how their faces were changed,

49:20.680 --> 49:24.799
that I could not recognize them who they were.

49:24.799 --> 49:32.670
The whole thing becomes absolutely mild, soft,
peaceful and very joyous.

49:32.670 --> 49:39.299
All the qualities of Shri Krishna can be expressed
on your face.

49:39.299 --> 49:42.089
You can be sometimes mischievous to look at.

49:42.089 --> 49:52.630
So many expressions there are which come on
the face, and give you a very sweet feeling.

49:52.630 --> 49:58.299
But some people have a habit of looking in
the mirror all the time, which is very wrong,

49:58.299 --> 50:01.489
because it gives you a kind of a funny ego.

50:01.489 --> 50:06.609
Is better to look at Shri Krishna’s photograph
than to look at your own faces, so that your

50:06.609 --> 50:10.660
face will become like that of Shri Krishna;
instead of you start looking in the mirror

50:10.660 --> 50:11.910
all the time.

50:11.910 --> 50:17.480
What will become of you, God knows, because
maybe if you go to your past, God knows what

50:17.480 --> 50:18.599
you’ll become.

50:18.599 --> 50:22.799
So also I’m thankful to psychiatrists that
they don’t like narcissism.

50:22.799 --> 50:27.949
But it’s very dangerous to all the time
watch your face in the mirror, very dangerous.

50:27.949 --> 50:32.890
It creates a very funny personality, that
you start telling yourself, “Oh, I’m Napoleon.”

50:32.890 --> 50:38.339
So you become Napoleon, and start behaving
like Napoleon.

50:38.339 --> 50:43.440
Next day you find one Napoleon walks out of
the bathroom!

50:43.440 --> 50:51.950
So one has to be careful not to pay so much
attention and importance to your own self,

50:51.950 --> 50:55.440
but to your Self which is within, which is
your spirit.

50:55.440 --> 51:02.150
And if you look after that side, then all
these things will happen in such a beautiful

51:02.150 --> 51:03.210
manner.

51:03.210 --> 51:06.719
Also the hair are looked after by Shri Krishna.

51:06.719 --> 51:13.289
Now you see, you know that He’s very fond
of anything that is like butter, so you have

51:13.289 --> 51:16.680
to put either butter or oil or something in
your hair.

51:16.680 --> 51:19.390
If you don’t put it you’ll become bald.

51:19.390 --> 51:23.930
What can – I mean it is after all a karma
phala.

51:23.930 --> 51:25.819
If you don’t put oil, you’ll become bald.

51:25.819 --> 51:31.549
So you have to put oil, and oil was put always
before in the West.

51:31.549 --> 51:36.029
I see all these old films and all that, they’re
all oiled people.

51:36.029 --> 51:41.349
But now of course, if you don’t want to
put oil in the daytime you can wash it off,

51:41.349 --> 51:46.760
but at least once a week you must oil your
head.

51:46.760 --> 51:51.799
Shri Krishna’s star is Saturn, Shani.

51:51.799 --> 52:01.450
They say that if He gets after somebody, then
nobody can be saved.

52:01.450 --> 52:05.349
If Shri Krishna gets after someone, then nobody
can be saved.

52:05.349 --> 52:10.960
In the same way, if Saturn gets after someone
then that person is finished, so we say it’s

52:10.960 --> 52:15.059
for sometimes, it is seven years He’s after
you, or sometimes two-and-a-half years after

52:15.059 --> 52:16.059
you.

52:16.059 --> 52:28.079
So this Saturn of Shri Krishna is a, it’s
a quality within us that, supposing if somebody

52:28.079 --> 52:33.130
troubles us or does something, we don’t
have to do anything.

52:33.130 --> 52:42.140
Now this Shri Krishna policy, this, we can
say, the Shri Krishna’s nature will work

52:42.140 --> 52:44.319
it out.

52:44.319 --> 52:53.829
It will inform this all-pervading Power, and
through that this man or this woman, or this

52:53.829 --> 52:58.039
party or this organization which is trying
to trouble us will be hounded, while we’ll

52:58.039 --> 52:59.519
be just sitting doing nothing.

52:59.519 --> 53:05.019
They’ll be just hounded till they jump in
the sea.

53:05.019 --> 53:06.569
Automatically it will happen.

53:06.569 --> 53:13.269
But you have to know that you have the powers
of Shri Krishna by which, if He gets after

53:13.269 --> 53:16.239
someone, then nobody can save them.

53:16.239 --> 53:20.819
He’s the last one who plays around, but
He doesn’t forgive.

53:20.819 --> 53:23.069
He doesn’t believe in forgiveness.

53:23.069 --> 53:26.229
He says, “Now, you had enough of it.”

53:26.229 --> 53:32.869
He gives a big, big long rope to hang yourself,
but He never forgives.

53:32.869 --> 53:35.829
One thing for definite, He never forgives.

53:35.829 --> 53:40.309
As you must have seen in Mahabharata His own
judgment of things, you see, He doesn’t

53:40.309 --> 53:41.309
forgive.

53:41.309 --> 53:42.309
He says, “You have to pay.

53:42.309 --> 53:45.359
You have to pay for it.”

53:45.359 --> 53:51.130
Except when, when you transcend.

53:51.130 --> 54:04.569
If you become a Sahaja yogi, if you have transcended
Vishuddhi, then He cannot do anything like

54:04.569 --> 54:05.710
that to you.

54:05.710 --> 54:12.930
But if you have not, if there’s no ascent
you cannot be saved, you cannot be saved from

54:12.930 --> 54:13.930
Him.

54:13.930 --> 54:18.900
They say once Mohammed Gajani came to loot
our country – I mean, it’s a story about

54:18.900 --> 54:22.009
the village folk.

54:22.009 --> 54:27.980
And there he’s looted Somnath, a big temple
of ours, which had lots of gold, jewelry,

54:27.980 --> 54:29.770
everything in it.

54:29.770 --> 54:34.952
So these brahmins were, you see, taking money
from all these people and looting them, and

54:34.952 --> 54:42.920
putting them in the temple and using them,
and the rest of the people were very poor.

54:42.920 --> 54:50.740
So it was sort of a reaction in them, and
the story they tell like this: so this Mohammed

54:50.740 --> 54:55.720
Gajani looted Somnath, is the temple of Mahadeva.

54:55.720 --> 55:01.439
Now Mahadeva never needs any ornaments or
anything, but they had put this there.

55:01.439 --> 55:10.160
So Hanumana saw that Mahadeva got out of the
temple and was running, so Hanumana ran after

55:10.160 --> 55:11.160
Him.

55:11.160 --> 55:15.440
Then at one point Mahadeva sat down, and Hanumana
came.

55:15.440 --> 55:18.410
He said, “You are the God of Gods.

55:18.410 --> 55:19.819
Why are You running?

55:19.819 --> 55:21.589
What are You afraid of?”

55:21.589 --> 55:23.910
He said, “You don’t know this Mohammed
Gajani?”

55:23.910 --> 55:25.589
He said, “No I don’t know.”

55:25.589 --> 55:27.269
“All right, hide behind a tree.”

55:27.269 --> 55:28.670
They hid behind a tree.

55:28.670 --> 55:33.229
So this Mohammed Gajani came and sat down
– this is the folklore I’m telling, folk

55:33.229 --> 55:37.219
people tell – sat down under that tree.

55:37.219 --> 55:42.859
And turning to Shri Krishna, he said, “This
horrible thing, if He gets after someone,

55:42.859 --> 55:45.109
who can be saved?

55:45.109 --> 55:49.299
Under my nose these brahmins were making money
and all that, putting it in Somnath temple,

55:49.299 --> 55:51.369
which was not to be done.

55:51.369 --> 55:57.240
I couldn’t do anything, so He came, and
with this fellow after me I cannot be saved

55:57.240 --> 56:00.679
either, so I am running away from the temple.”

56:00.679 --> 56:07.430
So this is the story given by the villagers,
but which shows that if Shri Krishna is after

56:07.430 --> 56:12.119
somebody, then nobody can save that person,
he has to run away; because He has so many

56:12.119 --> 56:16.839
tricks and so many styles that you can’t
get out of it.

56:16.839 --> 56:21.679
He’ll use His brains in so many manners,
and that He’ll put that person right who

56:21.679 --> 56:24.109
is trying to trouble you.

56:24.109 --> 56:31.460
So you must have complete faith in the powers
of Shri Krishna which is within yourself,

56:31.460 --> 56:33.349
which is being aware now.

56:33.349 --> 56:39.319
And also if you have ascended fully out of
this, then He will not trouble; but if you

56:39.319 --> 56:44.170
have left Vishuddhi He will trouble you, definitely.

56:44.170 --> 56:47.059
If you have left Vishuddhi Shri Krishna will
definitely trouble you, and be careful.

56:47.059 --> 56:49.869
So get rid of your left Vishuddhis now.

56:49.869 --> 56:51.089
That’s very important.

56:51.089 --> 56:57.230
Because then Shri Krishna will take your test
and will make you so miserable that you will

56:57.230 --> 56:58.329
not know why.

56:58.329 --> 57:03.099
“Mother, You see, I did this, I did this
puja, I did this till, let’s see now, this

57:03.099 --> 57:05.309
is the situation in my family.

57:05.309 --> 57:06.690
This is what happened.”

57:06.690 --> 57:09.979
“All right, are you a Catholic?”

57:09.979 --> 57:10.979
“Yes.”

57:10.979 --> 57:12.239
“Feel guilty?”

57:12.239 --> 57:13.239
“Yes.”

57:13.239 --> 57:15.259
“So have it.”

57:15.259 --> 57:16.259
What can I do?

57:16.259 --> 57:18.450
Shri Krishna cannot be controlled by anyone.

57:18.450 --> 57:25.119
He does whatever He thinks proper and He is
meant to really punish much more than the

57:25.119 --> 57:28.109
Mother, I can tell you.

57:28.109 --> 57:33.779
They say that She’s Adi Rudra, Adi Saumya:
She’s the one who’s very hard and also

57:33.779 --> 57:38.059
very, very soft, but up to a point.

57:38.059 --> 57:39.479
He is not.

57:39.479 --> 57:40.679
Nothing can convince Him.

57:40.679 --> 57:47.589
Once you get into His control, that He’ll
see to it that you are put right, left, right,

57:47.589 --> 57:50.309
any way He’ll make you all right.

57:50.309 --> 57:55.859
So one thing is there, that you should be
sure that you should have your Vishuddhis

57:55.859 --> 58:02.969
all right, first of all, and also get Shri
Krishna manifesting on others.

58:02.969 --> 58:04.630
You don’t have to do anything.

58:04.630 --> 58:06.742
He’ll look after you, everything, and work
it out.

58:06.742 --> 58:11.150
But left Vishuddhi is a disease of the West.

58:11.150 --> 58:16.040
I also feel so much from you all that I sometimes
feel like running away to India, because in

58:16.040 --> 58:18.069
India nobody feels guilty.

58:18.069 --> 58:20.180
They don’t believe in feeling guilty.

58:20.180 --> 58:21.230
“What is there?

58:21.230 --> 58:22.690
We have not murdered anyone.

58:22.690 --> 58:24.420
Why should we feel guilty?”

58:24.420 --> 58:27.410
Here it is a disease with everyone, “I feel
guilty.”

58:27.410 --> 58:34.829
I don’t know who has introduced this idea,
maybe this Catholic Church, but carried too

58:34.829 --> 58:35.829
far.

58:35.829 --> 58:42.219
So then we come to the Virata's point, is
here.

58:42.219 --> 58:48.499
Before that we have to cross the Hamsa; without
that you cannot reach the Virat point.

58:48.499 --> 58:55.920
So Hamsa is as you know very well, is the
discretion, divine discretion, which must

58:55.920 --> 58:59.249
be within you.

58:59.249 --> 59:03.839
Once you develop that, then you don’t commit
mistakes.

59:03.839 --> 59:09.509
You never commit mistakes – mistakes in
the sense you don’t do things which are

59:09.509 --> 59:12.079
again pushed back on you, or for which you
have to pay.

59:12.079 --> 59:15.170
It’s just a very straightforward life.

59:15.170 --> 59:16.539
“It’s so?

59:16.539 --> 59:17.900
It’s so.”

59:17.900 --> 59:23.720
With this discretion, absolutely you have
a complete understanding as to what has to

59:23.720 --> 59:26.460
be done and what not to be done.

59:26.460 --> 59:29.699
And if that is established, a discretion is
established.

59:29.699 --> 59:34.679
In many Sahaja yogis, I must say, discretion
has come even with their left Vishuddhi.

59:34.679 --> 59:38.900
Even if they have left Vishuddhi they have
this discretion, they know what is right and

59:38.900 --> 59:39.900
what is wrong.

59:39.900 --> 59:46.640
With that divine discretion, the first thing
that happens is that people get impressed

59:46.640 --> 59:47.640
by you.

59:47.640 --> 59:50.160
It’s real collectivity, it impresses the
collectivity.

59:50.160 --> 59:55.269
A person who has divine discretion, people
immediately see the wisdom of that person

59:55.269 --> 59:58.161
and think, “See now, this man, how could
he be?

59:58.161 --> 01:00:00.119
He’s so young, how could he be?

01:00:00.119 --> 01:00:03.199
He’s such a child, how could he be?”

01:00:03.199 --> 01:00:12.449
So this divine discretion which is the, here,
Hamsa Chakra’s speciality, when it starts

01:00:12.449 --> 01:00:20.679
manifesting then automatically you impress,
automatically you impress the collectivity.

01:00:20.679 --> 01:00:25.109
This is a very important point one has to
know.

01:00:25.109 --> 01:00:30.450
While introspecting yourself, you just see
if you have developed this quality of divine

01:00:30.450 --> 01:00:31.529
discretion or not.

01:00:31.529 --> 01:00:35.910
For example, there are many I have seen when
they come to the program, they come and tell

01:00:35.910 --> 01:00:39.160
Me, “Mother, some Sahaja yogi told me that
‘You have a bhoot.’

01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:41.509
Have I got a bhoot in me?”

01:00:41.509 --> 01:00:43.190
I said, “Not at all.

01:00:43.190 --> 01:00:45.890
How can there be any bhoot in you?”

01:00:45.890 --> 01:00:52.009
He may be having, but the divine discretion
is not to tell him just now, but to remove

01:00:52.009 --> 01:00:53.009
it.

01:00:53.009 --> 01:01:03.440
So divine discretion gives you a complete
understanding what is the way to handle another

01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:11.509
personality, what is the way to handle a collective,
how to talk to others, how to impress on them

01:01:11.509 --> 01:01:13.130
the right things.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:21.059
It’s a very, very expansive manifestation
in so many directions.

01:01:21.059 --> 01:01:24.519
If you have no divine discretion, you’ll
start speaking what you should not speak,

01:01:24.519 --> 01:01:29.430
you’ll start saying at a time when you should
not say.

01:01:29.430 --> 01:01:33.530
I mean, you’ll have no sense at all of any
direction.

01:01:33.530 --> 01:01:40.509
So to have divine discretion is very important,
for which as you know, Hamsa Chakra physically

01:01:40.509 --> 01:01:46.250
as well mentally and also spiritually must
be kept all right.

01:01:46.250 --> 01:01:52.450
In My Hamsas – we had one puja where I talked
about it.

01:01:52.450 --> 01:01:56.940
The last is the Virat: that is the state you
have to reach.

01:01:56.940 --> 01:02:02.219
Is the Virat is here in front, as you know.

01:02:02.219 --> 01:02:11.689
And I was surprised when I went to Nepal,
which is a temple of Shiva there: despite

01:02:11.689 --> 01:02:17.199
they were worshipping Shiva they were putting
all the kumkum here.

01:02:17.199 --> 01:02:22.029
So I thought that they don’t know why they
are putting, because even if you worship Shiva

01:02:22.029 --> 01:02:25.069
you must also worship here, the Virata.

01:02:25.069 --> 01:02:33.119
They don’t put it here – here; because
they’re absolutely hundred percent only

01:02:33.119 --> 01:02:37.689
Shiva worshippers, so why should they put
it here?

01:02:37.689 --> 01:02:47.849
Because somebody who knows, who was gnostic,
has told them that this is the place of Virat.

01:02:47.849 --> 01:03:05.339
Once you get into Virata, then all your ideas
of separating or differentiating goes away.

01:03:05.339 --> 01:03:14.589
You do not have any more ideas of races left,
of nationality, of your city, of your village

01:03:14.589 --> 01:03:15.869
or anything.

01:03:15.869 --> 01:03:22.589
At that stage you don’t belong to any place.

01:03:22.589 --> 01:03:24.839
You belong to every place, and you don’t
belong to every place.

01:03:24.839 --> 01:03:30.249
Such a situation comes in when you don’t
hanker after any particular food, you don’t

01:03:30.249 --> 01:03:40.179
like any particular type of people, you can
adjust yourself into any circumstances, into

01:03:40.179 --> 01:03:44.819
any families, into any kind of people.

01:03:44.819 --> 01:03:46.439
You can live with drunkards.

01:03:46.439 --> 01:03:54.179
I mean I have lived with drunkards – “lived”
means I have shaken hands at least with so

01:03:54.179 --> 01:03:55.549
many of them.

01:03:55.549 --> 01:03:58.759
You can be with any kind of person.

01:03:58.759 --> 01:04:04.309
Nothing bothers you because you are in the
Virata state; because everything is absorbed

01:04:04.309 --> 01:04:07.579
by the Virat, and you do not feel anything.

01:04:07.579 --> 01:04:10.880
Whatever sort of person may be, you do not
feel it.

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:16.650
The Virat has to suffer, not you, and that
is what is the best state where I want all

01:04:16.650 --> 01:04:22.539
of you to reach, and to become absolutely
free.

01:04:22.539 --> 01:04:28.660
Nothing can impress you, nothing can influence
you, nothing can dissuade you, but you stand

01:04:28.660 --> 01:04:34.179
on your self-esteem and understanding about
yourself, that you’re a Sahaja yogi and

01:04:34.179 --> 01:04:44.209
that you are connected with this power, and
you are a citizen of Kingdom of God.

01:04:44.209 --> 01:04:55.329
At the Virata state there's no doubt left
about it, no doubt, because you become part

01:04:55.329 --> 01:05:00.249
and parcel of the whole, absolutely, and you
can affect anywhere.

01:05:00.249 --> 01:05:02.509
If this finger is hurt, then this finger can
feel it.

01:05:02.509 --> 01:05:11.410
In the same way such a person is felt everywhere,
and not only that, but that person can be

01:05:11.410 --> 01:05:13.329
effective everywhere.

01:05:13.329 --> 01:05:20.489
For that state of reaching to Virat, one should
try to slowly, gradually, “Ya neti neti

01:05:20.489 --> 01:05:22.759
vachanaih nirgama avochu” say.

01:05:22.759 --> 01:05:25.069
You have to go on saying, “This is not my
sister.

01:05:25.069 --> 01:05:26.489
This is not my brother.

01:05:26.489 --> 01:05:28.429
They are all my brothers.

01:05:28.429 --> 01:05:29.999
They’re all my sisters.

01:05:29.999 --> 01:05:34.160
I love them the same as my sisters and my
brothers.

01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:35.749
This is not my family.

01:05:35.749 --> 01:05:38.719
The whole Sahaja Yoga is my family.”

01:05:38.719 --> 01:05:42.459
The whole attention should move like that.

01:05:42.459 --> 01:05:47.009
“This is not only mine, it is everybody’s.

01:05:47.009 --> 01:05:49.569
It belongs to everyone.

01:05:49.569 --> 01:05:51.759
Everybody has a right.”

01:05:51.759 --> 01:05:56.809
That sort of a thing, when it starts growing
from individual, what we call is the “vestiti

01:05:56.809 --> 01:06:04.089
tu sumestiti” in Sanskrit, they say “vestiti
tu sumestiti,” from individual to collective.

01:06:04.089 --> 01:06:10.349
And such a personality then is the most effective
one for any kind of collective work.

01:06:10.349 --> 01:06:14.519
I think for today it’s quite sufficient
for you to know about Vishuddhi Chakra.

01:06:14.519 --> 01:06:20.559
I mean, I have talked about it thousands and
thousands of times, and now this is one of

01:06:20.559 --> 01:06:25.650
the sides which I wanted to say, because I
find that still there are people who do not

01:06:25.650 --> 01:06:29.109
understand that they have to rise above Vishuddhi.

01:06:29.109 --> 01:06:35.740
Otherwise, if they do not ascend over Vishuddhi
they can never be proper Sahaja yogis, they’ll

01:06:35.740 --> 01:06:37.549
be always half-baked.

01:06:37.549 --> 01:06:45.059
So we must try to rise above the Vishuddhi,
the discretion part.

01:06:45.059 --> 01:06:51.509
Then at that point we can never doubt Sahaja
Yoga, can never doubt, and that’s how the

01:06:51.509 --> 01:06:52.509
doubtless awareness can come to us.

01:06:52.509 --> 01:06:53.509
May God bless you.

01:06:53.509 --> 01:06:54.509
All right.

01:06:54.509 --> 01:06:55.509
Shri Krishna Puja is very small that way,
not such a long thing.

01:06:55.509 --> 01:06:56.749
at Agnya
above Agnya
