00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:07.030
An introduction in English begins at 7mins 48secs.

00:07:45.068 --> 00:07:55.182
Very shortly, I have just
introduced three points of

00:07:55.186 --> 00:07:59.302
check list the plane is
undergoing, before taking off

00:07:59.304 --> 00:08:01.804
to be sure that it can fly and before Puja,

00:08:01.823 --> 00:08:05.260
there are a few things we have to remember.

00:08:05.263 --> 00:08:07.763
One is that you are not sitting here

00:08:07.763 --> 00:08:11.563
as U.N.observers with
our analytical faculties

00:08:11.573 --> 00:08:13.663
this allow us to try to find
out what is going on and

00:08:13.673 --> 00:08:16.173
whether we like it or not.

00:08:16.183 --> 00:08:21.443
Because the mental activity
is going to prevent us

00:08:21.443 --> 00:08:24.493
to feel the reality of
the event. The same way

00:08:24.483 --> 00:08:26.823
that shoes prevent us to feel the ground

00:08:26.833 --> 00:08:29.333
with our own skin and the same way that

00:08:29.353 --> 00:08:32.493
shoes are left before the door of the temple,

00:08:32.493 --> 00:08:36.913
in the same way, the mental has to be kept

00:08:36.913 --> 00:08:39.403
at the door of the Puja,

00:08:39.403 --> 00:08:43.013
so that we can maintain relationship with

00:08:43.013 --> 00:08:47.303
what really is going on in truth and in reality here.

00:08:47.299 --> 00:08:49.799
This is first part of the check list.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:52.719
Second part of the check list is that, what is really

00:08:52.711 --> 00:08:59.169
going on here is that, it is a ceremony for us,

00:08:59.172 --> 00:09:03.309
not for Shri Mataji.  It is for us. We are benefitting

00:09:03.315 --> 00:09:05.815
from the Puja, not Shri Mataji.

00:09:05.815 --> 00:09:09.435
Why? Becasue Shri Mataji is on the tenth floor.

00:09:09.423 --> 00:09:11.165
We are on the first floor.

00:09:11.166 --> 00:09:14.055
When Shri Mataji is
Mahamaya, when She talks

00:09:14.064 --> 00:09:16.564
in a Public Programme,
when She speaks to us

00:09:16.569 --> 00:09:18.314
as a normal human being,

00:09:18.314 --> 00:09:19.934
She climbed down from the tenth floor

00:09:19.934 --> 00:09:22.434
and She looked very human, one of us

00:09:22.434 --> 00:09:24.934
and this is not so. She is not one of us, in that

00:09:24.934 --> 00:09:27.824
sense. Although She is
much more human than

00:09:27.824 --> 00:09:29.174
all of us put together.

00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:31.690
In truth She is not a Human Being. All right?

00:09:31.690 --> 00:09:35.964
Now,

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:40.190
What happened is... in a
Puja we address ourselves

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:42.961
to Shri Mataji in the
dimension where She is on

00:09:42.970 --> 00:09:45.231
the tenth floor.

00:09:45.231 --> 00:09:48.501
We address ourselves
to Her for what She is

00:09:48.497 --> 00:09:53.271
which is...The Infinite One

00:09:53.271 --> 00:09:58.606
and through this, the frequency of Shri Mataji's

00:09:58.626 --> 00:10:01.320
Chakras, which are addressed
in the proper protocol

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:09.391
start revolving... start
revolving at a much more

00:10:09.392 --> 00:10:11.511
subtle and higher frequency.

00:10:11.517 --> 00:10:15.167
In such a way, we can
absorb within three of four

00:10:15.162 --> 00:10:19.122
hours of Puja, what we cannot achieve

00:10:19.129 --> 00:10:22.122
within one or two years, perhaps, of meditation

00:10:22.135 --> 00:10:26.042
at home. This is the
perception we have to have

00:10:26.045 --> 00:10:29.616
before Puja, that we are here to benefit.

00:10:29.646 --> 00:10:31.652
It is for us.

00:10:31.652 --> 00:10:33.912
Because we enter in a relationship with Her

00:10:33.912 --> 00:10:38.582
in Her Truth, which is that She is the Goddess.

00:10:38.583 --> 00:10:41.083
Even if we don't know
it, even if we doubt it,

00:10:41.083 --> 00:10:46.213
even if we have questions
about it, this is our problem.

00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:49.923
The grass is green outside,
whether you like it or not

00:10:49.923 --> 00:10:52.125
and whether you are doubting or not.

00:10:52.125 --> 00:10:54.593
If you see the grass red, it's your problem.

00:10:54.575 --> 00:10:57.943
In the same way Shri Mataji is Adi Shakti.

00:10:57.973 --> 00:11:01.503
She is The Holy Spirit. She is the Primoridal Being

00:11:01.487 --> 00:11:07.313
and those who have not realised it
and there are many of us who have not,

00:11:07.323 --> 00:11:11.893
because it is a sacred privilege
to enter into that mystery.

00:11:11.883 --> 00:11:18.153
Next, with a desire to progress on the discovery
of the true nature of who Shri Mataji is.

00:11:18.151 --> 00:11:22.205
OK?  Puja is just for this.

00:11:22.205 --> 00:11:27.751
That was the second point that we are here
to benefit and what was the third point?

00:11:27.740 --> 00:11:32.190
Now let's see if anyone has listened to me here.

00:11:36.143 --> 00:11:38.643
I shouldn't forget it!  I'm sorry!

00:11:41.446 --> 00:11:45.962
OK. The third point is humility.

00:11:45.975 --> 00:11:48.475
You see,

00:11:50.646 --> 00:11:55.972
I remember one line, which was
written in this book and this is that

00:11:55.976 --> 00:12:02.746
humility is the security
of those who come near God,

00:12:02.742 --> 00:12:06.076
because God is something just... it's too much

00:12:06.095 --> 00:12:08.456
I mean, just way out

00:12:08.456 --> 00:12:12.666
There is no way, we can start
grasping what that Being

00:12:12.684 --> 00:12:17.456
is; even if it sitting before us in this little chair.

00:12:17.456 --> 00:12:21.292
So, we come with all kind of stuff within us,

00:12:21.300 --> 00:12:24.622
which is perhaps nice, and
perhaps also not so nice.

00:12:24.626 --> 00:12:34.928
The only way, we can come nearer to this
fantastic reality is to be humble;

00:12:34.958 --> 00:12:42.093
or else happens... what
has happened to many of us.

00:12:42.115 --> 00:12:45.303
is that we have to learn it the hard way.

00:12:45.333 --> 00:12:59.653
We are whirled around in various
paths of tests and tensions for us to discover

00:12:59.651 --> 00:13:06.913
that our ego is the one
who keeps us out of reality.

00:13:06.912 --> 00:13:14.430
Now we all have desires here. Right?  One is the desire to improve his health. OK

00:13:14.437 --> 00:13:17.057
Another one is the desire to get a job.

00:13:17.049 --> 00:13:24.047
The third one is the desire that
his wife should be all right.

00:13:24.047 --> 00:13:26.732
The third one, the fourth
one, the fifth one! OK?

00:13:26.732 --> 00:13:29.392
Everybody has a problem here alright.

00:13:29.392 --> 00:13:37.342
Now please put this shopping
bag of demands on the side

00:13:37.353 --> 00:13:43.278
and have only one desire, is
to be one with The Supreme,

00:13:43.298 --> 00:13:46.098
to be one with the reality

00:13:46.128 --> 00:13:50.108
to be one with God, because
that is what your Kundalini is,

00:13:50.107 --> 00:13:53.604
the desire to be one with God.

00:13:53.607 --> 00:14:01.466
And by asking for this, ask for the supreme.
The other things will be given 'en passant.'

00:14:01.466 --> 00:14:08.204
Don't ask for small stuff, because
you are facing a big giver

00:14:08.224 --> 00:14:11.978
and don't come in front of someone, who
has one billion dollars in the pocket

00:14:11.978 --> 00:14:13.947
asking for 5 dollars.

00:14:13.995 --> 00:14:18.808
Don't! It's stupid. It's not as
a Swiss that I'm speaking to you.

00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:22.400
It's a Sahaja Yogi; although
there is some element

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:26.124
of Swiss consciousness
in this , I suppose.

00:14:27.729 --> 00:14:34.431
Be clever! You are in front of the biggest
giver of the world and don't ask for peanuts.

00:14:39.504 --> 00:14:41.534
It is true.  She is that

00:14:41.551 --> 00:14:45.948
If you would know, you would be
floating one metre above ground.

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:49.328
I see some of you sitting
there, you just don't know it.

00:14:49.342 --> 00:14:53.658
So ask, "Mother may I know Who You are?"

00:14:56.329 --> 00:15:05.789
You would shoot through your top like...
Have the courage to ask for reality.

00:15:05.789 --> 00:15:08.849
Have that courage! You
are big enough for this.

00:15:08.919 --> 00:15:13.419
In all dimensions of that word.

00:15:17.768 --> 00:15:22.808
We are no small people, even if we look
completely screwed up, we are big people.

00:15:22.802 --> 00:15:25.302
or else She would not
have picked us up,

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.820
The fourth point of the check list

00:19:10.855 --> 00:19:13.355
Fourth is confidence.

00:19:15.185 --> 00:19:19.718
Everybody has difficulties and
everybody has to overcome them.

00:19:19.718 --> 00:19:28.453
Each test is a blessing and each blessing is a test.

00:19:28.454 --> 00:19:34.162
So even if we are not so good in Sahaja
Yoga, even if we don't meditate so well,

00:19:34.187 --> 00:19:40.582
even if we think that our attention is useless, even
if we have within our brains things which are dirty,

00:19:40.574 --> 00:19:43.074
It does not matter,

00:19:44.261 --> 00:19:52.038
because we will overcome. We will
be stronger than negativity.

00:19:52.050 --> 00:19:58.190
We participate in this cosmic
fight against the assuric vidya,

00:19:58.193 --> 00:20:06.297
against the black knowledge of the
evil which is completely active now,

00:20:06.306 --> 00:20:08.116
because the powers
which are given to us

00:20:08.147 --> 00:20:12.806
are greater than the powers
of evil. It is a fact.

00:20:16.206 --> 00:20:18.706
Jai Shri Mataji.

00:20:21.503 --> 00:20:24.599
Now, we are going to do with.....

00:20:41.078 --> 00:20:49.817
Music plays until Shri Mataji arrives at 22mins 14 secs.

00:24:49.095 --> 00:25:01.824
Today we have gathered here in this beautiful
place, to work out something very deep.

00:25:15.652 --> 00:25:23.471
There are certain things of which we
are not aware, which are in the history,

00:25:29.418 --> 00:25:34.908
and some things in the atmosphere,

00:25:36.002 --> 00:25:39.278
they affect us very much,

00:25:40.614 --> 00:25:47.402
because we are the product of five elements,

00:25:53.150 --> 00:26:01.749
out of which the Mother Earth
is the left side within us.

00:26:07.251 --> 00:26:15.527
The Mother Earth changes its atmosphere

00:26:15.537 --> 00:26:22.242
its hills and dales, rivers,
fashions them in such a way

00:26:22.243 --> 00:26:28.554
that it gives a variety
to her temperaments.

00:26:40.576 --> 00:26:45.582
Now God has created only one world,
He’s not created many worlds,

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.110
He’s created only one
world, this world,

00:26:48.110 --> 00:26:55.240
where alone here only
human beings are created.

00:27:03.399 --> 00:27:07.633
So, this is the most
important planet, you can say,

00:27:07.643 --> 00:27:13.023
which has been in the
attention of the Divine.

00:27:21.568 --> 00:27:28.698
So, the whole cosmos works out
for the benefit of this planet,

00:27:35.993 --> 00:27:46.003
and the working of that cosmos has created this earth, and then human beings, and then the Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:56.027 --> 00:28:05.108
So, the Sahaja Yogis are the
epitome of the creative powers.

00:28:11.429 --> 00:28:15.126
They are the epitome of God’s desire,

00:28:18.034 --> 00:28:20.534
that’s what He desired.

00:28:21.943 --> 00:28:27.067
That’s why He created this cosmos,
this universe and this earth.

00:28:34.075 --> 00:28:37.447
So now His desire is fulfilled

00:28:40.990 --> 00:28:46.756
when He sees His Being
reflected through the Sahaja Yogis

00:28:52.447 --> 00:29:00.799
But there is still a few things we
have to clear out within ourselves.

00:29:10.953 --> 00:29:15.736
His desire represents the
Mahakali power within us.

00:29:20.628 --> 00:29:27.338
Now we have to see how His desire
has worked in creating ourselves.

00:29:32.023 --> 00:29:36.448
First is the desire which is absolutely passionate.

00:29:40.549 --> 00:29:49.065
There’s nothing desired, nothing else is
desired, but the creation of Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:00.164 --> 00:30:08.443
So, the first desire of any Sahaja
Yogi is to create more Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:14.936 --> 00:30:21.154
No other desire should be
dominant or exist, in a way;

00:30:27.172 --> 00:30:32.992
but to fulfill that desire, we
have to fulfill some conditions.

00:30:37.668 --> 00:30:43.401
So, one of the conditions, the
most important, is the sincerity,

00:30:48.439 --> 00:30:55.689
as God doesn’t need that qualification, He
cannot be insincere even if He wants to be.

00:31:03.243 --> 00:31:11.904
He does not have your type of intellect
which can play devious roles with Him,

00:31:20.379 --> 00:31:28.261
but the human beings have got this devious
intellect, which plays very much around.

00:31:39.002 --> 00:31:45.481
But as Sahaja Yogis you can see that
intellect very carefully and clearly.

00:31:50.218 --> 00:31:57.252
God is egoless because He does
everything, so He’s egoless,

00:32:03.673 --> 00:32:10.887
or we can say He is the Ego only,
if that means doing something.

00:32:15.965 --> 00:32:17.975
But human beings have ego

00:32:17.983 --> 00:32:21.773
because they don’t do anything
and think they’re doing something.

00:32:35.055 --> 00:32:37.555
You know this very well.

00:32:42.224 --> 00:32:45.192
So, when you start assuming
that you do something,

00:32:45.174 --> 00:32:47.942
you get identified with
such myths very easily,

00:32:47.962 --> 00:32:52.552
only human beings can be
identified with Myths, not God.

00:33:02.849 --> 00:33:07.061
But after Realisation you
can see your ego clearly.

00:33:11.872 --> 00:33:14.372
It acts in various ways.

00:33:18.362 --> 00:33:21.502
If we appoint somebody as a leader,

00:33:21.513 --> 00:33:24.692
the leader may start thinking
that he’s really the leader,

00:33:34.549 --> 00:33:38.729
and then it becomes really a problem for him

00:33:38.729 --> 00:33:45.279
because he starts losing
everything that is leadership.

00:33:56.505 --> 00:34:00.496
But the worst is, their wives start
thinking they are the leaders,

00:34:07.818 --> 00:34:12.669
and sometimes the children
also think that way;

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.977
and I won’t be surprised even if
their dogs and pets behave that way.

00:34:38.744 --> 00:34:42.513
It can be any stupid thing.

00:34:47.502 --> 00:34:55.955
So, with this kind of an ego a Sahaja Yogi
can see, you see, himself, how he behaves.

00:35:03.183 --> 00:35:09.823
I watch them and it provides a lot of humour for Me

00:35:09.803 --> 00:35:11.033
I watch them with their ego.

00:35:11.033 --> 00:35:12.313
"Them" being the leaders?

00:35:12.353 --> 00:35:13.943
No, no, no!  All!  All of them.

00:35:13.933 --> 00:35:15.033
I was worried.

00:35:29.483 --> 00:35:33.793
They push forward everywhere,
they’ll sit in the forward line,

00:35:33.826 --> 00:35:37.072
they’ll push forward, they’ll be there first to

00:35:37.092 --> 00:35:41.202
come in the front line,
sort of thing is there.

00:35:54.381 --> 00:35:57.389
But if you are a sincere person,

00:35:57.389 --> 00:36:03.899
if you have the sincerity, then you’ll enjoy
that sincerity wherever you are standing,

00:36:03.911 --> 00:36:06.411
wherever you are sitting.

00:36:16.156 --> 00:36:20.493
So, the ego can try to deceive
you very much all the time,

00:36:20.504 --> 00:36:23.116
so you have to be
careful about this ego

00:36:23.116 --> 00:36:26.716
because he can sit on your
head and can monitor you.

00:36:40.406 --> 00:36:48.121
I have seen people going down very rapidly
with this idea that they’re something special.

00:36:58.679 --> 00:37:02.549
So, sincerity, though it is
the quality of the left side,

00:37:02.549 --> 00:37:06.049
can be dominated by the
right side, this way.

00:37:18.073 --> 00:37:23.763
The second thing about your desire,
that it should be a pure desire

00:37:30.281 --> 00:37:36.113
and the pure desire is very simple for
you because I’m sitting before you.

00:37:44.295 --> 00:37:48.495
The pure desire of a
seeker is to see God,

00:37:48.489 --> 00:37:57.136
to be in the company of God,
to be in association with God.

00:38:15.388 --> 00:38:22.053
As they call it, Salokya, Samipya and
Sanidya; there are three words describing it.

00:38:27.891 --> 00:38:32.521
But without asking, without thinking of it,

00:38:32.539 --> 00:38:36.951
you have been given the fourth
dimension called as the Tadatmya,

00:38:36.950 --> 00:38:40.886
means becoming one with My body, My being;

00:38:53.075 --> 00:38:56.250
so that you become protected,

00:38:56.260 --> 00:38:58.070
absolutely cleansed

00:38:58.070 --> 00:39:00.570
and nourished in My being.

00:39:07.857 --> 00:39:12.299
But when you are not aware of it,

00:39:12.309 --> 00:39:14.119
then what happens,

00:39:14.149 --> 00:39:18.437
that I have to suffer in My body to cleanse you.

00:39:28.772 --> 00:39:34.580
So, all other desires can
create problems within you.

00:39:43.364 --> 00:39:51.314
Now as I was telling you that this France
is a creation of the Mother Earth,

00:39:51.333 --> 00:39:53.833
with her special features.

00:40:00.306 --> 00:40:05.435
We have to examine what effects
it can have on a French mind.

00:40:13.129 --> 00:40:20.869
It’s a historical build-up also
which affects this country.

00:40:26.894 --> 00:40:29.586
It’s a very affluent country,

00:40:29.561 --> 00:40:35.474
you have got very rich soil and you produce beautiful agricultural products.

00:40:40.694 --> 00:40:52.316
So, when you are satisfied on the material
level then you start moving left or right,

00:41:01.531 --> 00:41:05.280
because you are very
naïve about one thing,

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:12.010
that we have to rise higher,
higher into our ascent.

00:41:22.959 --> 00:41:29.706
Also, that we are not aware that
that is the goal for our evolution.

00:41:36.721 --> 00:41:43.345
So, we all have to ascend, that’s
all, nothing else is important.

00:41:51.044 --> 00:41:57.298
So as soon as you find that
materially you are all right,

00:41:57.302 --> 00:42:03.588
then if you do not have the
idea that you have to ascend,

00:42:03.586 --> 00:42:07.268
you can really move on to
the left and the right.

00:42:21.004 --> 00:42:29.986
France being a very, very affluent country
among most of the European and the English,

00:42:30.002 --> 00:42:37.426
they got into this movement much
earlier than any other country.

00:42:49.035 --> 00:42:56.914
So, the, if you can find the aggressiveness
of the French, based on these lines,

00:42:56.934 --> 00:42:59.434
because they go to the right side.

00:43:06.862 --> 00:43:14.802
Like the French are never bothered to see or to find out what is the culture of other people.

00:43:25.093 --> 00:43:28.783
They’re very self-opinionated
and thought no end of themselves

00:43:28.788 --> 00:43:32.123
and they thought they knew
all what was culture is.

00:43:40.107 --> 00:43:47.182
As a result, they became completely
ignorant of all other cultures

00:43:47.168 --> 00:43:50.061
which were much more
evolved than theirs

00:44:01.676 --> 00:44:11.359
The concept of beauty came up to
a certain level of understanding

00:44:11.365 --> 00:44:15.874
and then again it deviated
into wrong direction.

00:44:27.902 --> 00:44:32.378
Also, I would say, the way the
Christianity was preached in those days,

00:44:32.374 --> 00:44:35.828
no respect for women was there.

00:44:45.738 --> 00:44:49.552
So, the women did not understand
that they are the left side

00:44:49.552 --> 00:44:52.682
and they have to look
after their chastity.

00:45:07.350 --> 00:45:15.356
In the beginning whenever I read about
French, like Emile Zola or other people

00:45:15.356 --> 00:45:22.596
Maupassant, all that, what I found
that women were not at all respected,

00:45:22.602 --> 00:45:25.102
nor they were respectable,

00:45:38.426 --> 00:45:44.356
or if you read, say, for example, Nana,
is a one, he has written, Emile Zola;

00:45:44.354 --> 00:45:49.336
if you read her, you will be surprised that they have given the four sides of a woman in one woman,

00:45:49.323 --> 00:45:51.823
he has described four sides.

00:45:58.570 --> 00:46:04.264
And one part which is really a woman
is never respected in the society

00:46:04.274 --> 00:46:09.368
when she is compassionate and good,
that part she’s not respected:

00:46:09.377 --> 00:46:11.258
on the contrary she’s kicked out.

00:46:11.258 --> 00:46:18.497
So, in other parts, she behaves a cunning
woman, or she behaves like a prostitute,

00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.885
or she behaves like an aggressive woman,
because the part that is respectable,

00:46:23.889 --> 00:46:28.005
and that is the one which was for
her ascent and was her innate,

00:46:28.005 --> 00:46:31.319
was not at all understood or respected.

00:46:59.853 --> 00:47:07.483
So, the instrument of the left side which are the women of this country were first harmed

00:47:16.376 --> 00:47:22.943
and these became the main
source of troubles in France.

00:47:31.448 --> 00:47:35.011
On the other side, they
became extremely aggressive;

00:47:37.781 --> 00:47:44.133
the men became aggressive and because women were not respected, they also became aggressive.

00:47:48.638 --> 00:47:53.653
The other women who could not
do that became extreme left,

00:47:53.658 --> 00:47:57.988
started crying, weeping and melancholy;

00:47:59.242 --> 00:48:03.720
melancholy character they
developed, melancholy.

00:48:20.165 --> 00:48:26.265
Then they started, you see, writing
about all this melancholy nonsense,

00:48:26.273 --> 00:48:33.275
which doesn’t exist and indulging into
it, like wine or some sort of a thing.

00:48:37.235 --> 00:48:42.502
The movement on the left-hand side, naturally, because men also got attracted towards it,

00:48:42.481 --> 00:48:46.328
made them take to
left-sided food as well.

00:48:52.817 --> 00:49:00.184
Now, for example, they developed the
cheese which was all full of fungus,

00:49:00.224 --> 00:49:03.070
which was dead matter.

00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:16.520
Fungus kills all that is right side;

00:49:20.242 --> 00:49:22.742
anything living can be
killed with fungus.

00:49:26.432 --> 00:49:30.132
Not only as far as the food is
concerned but temperamentally

00:49:30.122 --> 00:49:33.502
gradually they started
becoming like funguses.

00:49:44.777 --> 00:49:52.546
So, the fungus itself has a quality, is
to, that it thrives on the dead matter.

00:49:59.666 --> 00:50:06.579
So they went down to all places where they
could find the dead matter, like Egypt.

00:50:17.015 --> 00:50:20.668
They were not very much interested
in India, even to rule India,

00:50:26.082 --> 00:50:32.849
but they were very much interested
in Egyptian dead things

00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:39.011
and other places wherever they could
find this dead stuff available to them.

00:50:51.399 --> 00:50:57.270
Also, I would say Christianity,
which started decaying very much,

00:50:57.302 --> 00:50:59.802
became a big hold in France.

00:51:14.438 --> 00:51:17.192
Religion also became like a fungus;

00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:35.380
like building, say, big churches
and around them to bury the dead.

00:51:44.518 --> 00:51:51.183
Now, I went to see Chartres; you have a
beautiful, a very, very beautiful church

00:51:51.217 --> 00:51:58.743
and very good work done by the artist, but there are lying all dead bodies all around, it’s horrible.

00:52:11.363 --> 00:52:18.248
Actually, dead people should be burnt,
only the realised soul can be buried.

00:52:37.684 --> 00:52:47.099
The sense of respect was lacking very much,
even in the history, you can see clearly.

00:52:52.855 --> 00:52:55.355
What was important
throughout was the money.

00:52:59.775 --> 00:53:08.522
As I see the French revolution took place when I must say the queen was not a bad woman at all.

00:53:22.203 --> 00:53:26.248
She was actually a great protégée.

00:53:26.254 --> 00:53:31.218
She was a protector of all the artists of France

00:53:31.204 --> 00:53:37.923
and she’s the one who gave such a
great momentum to the art of France.

00:53:46.923 --> 00:53:55.720
If she created something like a furniture piece or any building, today even you show it with pride.

00:54:00.512 --> 00:54:06.858
After all she was not going to take it with
her; it was for France she made everything.

00:54:10.611 --> 00:54:13.764
But the French wanted more
money to be distributed.

00:54:13.764 --> 00:54:17.881
For what? For drinking more wine,

00:54:27.499 --> 00:54:30.551
not to create anything
of eternal interest.

00:54:39.711 --> 00:54:44.466
That’s why I say those who drink have no
right to strike, or to ask for more money

00:54:44.445 --> 00:54:48.247
because they have more money,
that’s why they drink.

00:55:02.192 --> 00:55:09.040
So, I don’t believe in capitalism, but I do believe that those who can create something new,

00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:17.031
who can create something – not new in the sense of nonsense, but a thing of eternal values

00:55:17.053 --> 00:55:20.731
must be given money to create that.

00:55:36.057 --> 00:55:38.557
There are many capitalists
who do wrong things,

00:55:38.557 --> 00:55:43.992
like buying instruments of
war and things like that.

00:55:53.832 --> 00:55:56.953
Now we have England, we have America,

00:55:56.953 --> 00:56:01.551
they’re doing this and creating
concrete jungle for the progeny.

00:56:03.686 --> 00:56:06.556
Great Britain and England
and America is doing this.

00:56:06.561 --> 00:56:11.623
is to buy more weapons and otherwise
creating concrete jungles.

00:56:22.981 --> 00:56:30.265
And in Russia they say that they are giving equal distribution, but people drink like fish.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:49.405
So, with this French revolution also,

00:56:49.403 --> 00:56:56.575
the drinking became a part and
parcel of the lives of the French,

00:56:56.575 --> 00:56:59.075
because they got easy money.

00:57:17.058 --> 00:57:23.998
So, the more money was acquired for
doing all kinds of unrighteous things,

00:57:24.020 --> 00:57:29.044
unholy things and, we can
say, inauspicious things.

00:57:37.354 --> 00:57:41.600
But there were poor people, perhaps
they did not drink so much,

00:57:41.617 --> 00:57:45.610
who created great architecture
here in this country.

00:57:54.907 --> 00:58:00.553
Despite that, great artists were born
in this country who had no money.

00:58:00.562 --> 00:58:06.124
They died, becoming mad
or becoming paupers.

00:58:22.234 --> 00:58:29.284
Now we have Napoleon, another person
who tried to conquer other places;

00:58:29.314 --> 00:58:33.321
he’s another ego trip that
he did in the history.

00:58:39.871 --> 00:58:42.591
But still he was not
a very ignoble person

00:58:42.591 --> 00:58:47.650
as we find so many of them are
these days, who are the rulers.

00:58:54.908 --> 00:59:00.440
The only thing I feel about him that
he didn’t have a great character

00:59:00.438 --> 00:59:04.040
to leave any great
impress on people,

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:08.878
how to enhance their
life in their quality.

00:59:29.315 --> 00:59:35.947
So, the people who could have really
impressed your minds towards the ascent

00:59:35.974 --> 00:59:40.157
were all paupers or became
mad or were wasted.

01:00:03.612 --> 01:00:16.271
Ultimately, I think the whole aggressiveness disappeared
with understanding that it is no use aggressing,

01:00:16.247 --> 01:00:20.771
but the left movement still
remained very prevalent.

01:00:37.635 --> 01:00:44.951
So, for the rest of the world, French
are very weird, queer, strange people.

01:00:51.620 --> 01:00:56.518
They developed their own insular
methods of dealing with things.

01:01:03.298 --> 01:01:10.924
This is, I would say, is a curse because that kind of a curse when it works out, then you cannot improve

01:01:10.924 --> 01:01:16.257
as you have nothing else to
see and relate and to advance.

01:01:28.792 --> 01:01:37.160
Because the ego when it is worked with the left problems, you can be very queer, strange and weird.

01:01:44.256 --> 01:01:49.502
I could see that the
first day I came to Paris,

01:01:53.826 --> 01:01:59.216
and they told Me very clearly
that, “Mother, don’t smile at all,

01:02:06.922 --> 01:02:09.422
and You have to keep very serious.”

01:02:10.874 --> 01:02:15.991
And I cannot be serious for more than
two minutes, I think, two minutes.

01:02:21.528 --> 01:02:24.630
So, I said, “But why?”

01:02:24.647 --> 01:02:28.463
The reason, they said was that, “They
will think that You are an ignoramus,

01:02:28.453 --> 01:02:30.313
You don’t know what’s
happening in this world:

01:02:30.341 --> 01:02:34.083
serious things are happening
and You are laughing.

01:02:41.129 --> 01:02:44.374
So, they will think that
You are not at all matured.”

01:02:49.754 --> 01:02:56.517
But as soon as I started My lecture, I
looked at those people who were so serious

01:03:05.228 --> 01:03:08.756
and I couldn’t control My laughter!

01:03:16.981 --> 01:03:19.481
I hope it is changing.

01:03:23.498 --> 01:03:26.668
And then I said,

01:03:26.677 --> 01:03:32.248
“Sorry, I’m addressing all the les
Misérables which I have heard about."

01:03:40.462 --> 01:03:46.860
I am so happy to see today, that
veil of gloom, has passed over.

01:03:58.362 --> 01:04:02.222
As if lot of dirty mud
had gathered over here

01:04:02.207 --> 01:04:06.077
and the lotuses were
about to bloom out,

01:04:16.252 --> 01:04:19.523
whatever may be the atmosphere,
whatever may be the history,

01:04:19.539 --> 01:04:24.458
whatever may be that has been
created by human beings,

01:04:24.447 --> 01:04:33.812
inside resides beautiful lotus
petals, everything intact.

01:04:46.542 --> 01:04:51.097
With a little push they are
all out now in the atmosphere

01:04:51.123 --> 01:04:56.747
spreading their fragrance in this
dirty pool what we call as France.

01:05:12.037 --> 01:05:20.987
And they’re such strong people, very strong Sahaja Yogis in France which really makes Me very happy and proud.

01:05:32.709 --> 01:05:36.632
In the beginning I used to come
every third week to Paris

01:05:36.638 --> 01:05:42.532
and have a meeting and when they asked,
“Mother, why are You so much visiting Paris?”

01:05:42.551 --> 01:05:45.051
I said, “That is the gate of the hell.”

01:05:54.332 --> 01:06:01.082
You must have heard the story I’ve told
you about the advertising department.

01:06:07.326 --> 01:06:11.096
Ok I had better tell them.

01:06:11.090 --> 01:06:16.480
You see, two men who had done lot
of good as Sahaja Yogis maybe,

01:06:16.460 --> 01:06:20.310
when they died, they were
asked to go to Heaven.

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:31.772
So they went to Heaven and there they
found everybody was meditating,

01:06:31.772 --> 01:06:36.791
so they said, “What is new about this,
we were meditating in the world?”

01:06:44.319 --> 01:06:50.039
So they said, “Why not we..."
They asked the permission of God,

01:06:50.039 --> 01:06:52.931
that, "Can we see also
Hell, if we have a chance?

01:06:52.930 --> 01:06:55.600
Because we... then we
can decide you see,

01:06:55.611 --> 01:06:58.478
whether we want to be here or there."

01:07:08.348 --> 01:07:10.848
You see that is what the ego
is, you must have choice.

01:07:16.817 --> 01:07:19.777
So they went to Hell,

01:07:22.290 --> 01:07:28.457
and when they entered the first big hall, they found all kind of music was going on,

01:07:28.497 --> 01:07:34.767
funny type of music and you know like Halloween you have all kinds of dirty things

01:07:34.797 --> 01:07:37.297
and women were dancing nude,

01:07:37.297 --> 01:07:38.987
and the men were singing nude

01:07:39.007 --> 01:07:42.377
and they were doing all funny, funny
things there, which we call funny.

01:08:02.617 --> 01:08:08.385
So, they said, “This seems to
be better place for a change,”

01:08:14.531 --> 01:08:18.371
because drinking was free,
everything was free there;

01:08:20.585 --> 01:08:23.085
drugs,

01:08:26.293 --> 01:08:28.793
all nice, nice things there!

01:08:34.624 --> 01:08:37.774
So, they said, “It's
very nice place.”

01:08:37.798 --> 01:08:40.888
So, the people who were in charge
said, “What are you doing here?”

01:08:48.638 --> 01:08:52.882
So they said, “We’ve come to visit
the Hell, where is the Hell?”

01:09:00.161 --> 01:09:03.741
So, they said, “You can see from this
hole”, and they took them to a hole

01:09:03.762 --> 01:09:06.262
from where they could
see the picture of Hell.

01:09:12.233 --> 01:09:15.829
And there they found people
hanging on top of fire,

01:09:15.832 --> 01:09:23.227
or they were put in the boiling oil
and they were put in the dirty mud;

01:09:23.229 --> 01:09:26.172
all kinds of things, you see,
and they were horrified.

01:09:37.751 --> 01:09:40.161
And some were whipped very
badly, and I don’t know,

01:09:40.161 --> 01:09:43.201
all kinds of punishments
that are possible.

01:09:46.469 --> 01:09:47.999
So, they got a fright and they said,

01:09:48.028 --> 01:09:51.068
“Now if that is Hell, what
is this in this hall?”

01:09:55.973 --> 01:10:00.591
They said, “This is the
Advertising Department of Hell.”

01:10:24.744 --> 01:10:29.628
And the ideas were coming from
French and English specialists,

01:10:29.646 --> 01:10:33.592
and other specialists from
other European countries also.

01:10:42.065 --> 01:10:44.922
And nowadays the Swiss must be
doing all the banking there.

01:10:53.396 --> 01:10:58.909
So that is the advertising
department about which,

01:10:58.909 --> 01:11:02.879
you see, one should be quite knowledgeable,

01:11:02.878 --> 01:11:05.879
to know what is the advertising
department of Hell is.

01:11:14.673 --> 01:11:19.213
So, the righteousness and the holiness

01:11:19.247 --> 01:11:27.537
can only be maintained if you are very
careful about this advertising departments,

01:11:27.536 --> 01:11:30.782
especially in France and other countries.

01:11:43.847 --> 01:11:50.744
The left side works in this way
that we want to destroy ourselves,

01:11:54.342 --> 01:11:59.974
because left side stands for
desire as well as for destruction.

01:12:03.616 --> 01:12:09.963
It can destroy all if there
is no desire of God anymore.

01:12:13.895 --> 01:12:20.625
So, when you start getting to
the other side of your desires,

01:12:20.609 --> 01:12:23.945
you have a desire to destroy yourself.

01:12:32.249 --> 01:12:45.092
Yesterday only I read in a newspaper
an English lady who left millions of pounds,
killed herself by malnutrition.

01:12:55.308 --> 01:13:03.575
So, this idea of destroying yourself is now justifying so many things that we do in this world,

01:13:03.572 --> 01:13:06.212
which should not be done for our health,

01:13:06.214 --> 01:13:10.212
for our physical, mental and
emotional and spiritual health.

01:13:23.979 --> 01:13:30.455
And this tendency is to be seen by
Sahaja Yogis within themselves also.

01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.060
When the Sahaja Yogis start slipping out

01:13:40.070 --> 01:13:43.230
and you tell them, "You are slipping
out, now don't go that way."

01:13:43.247 --> 01:13:47.687
so they say, “No, leave me alone,
it’s all right, I can manage myself,”

01:13:47.697 --> 01:13:50.197
means, “I can destroy myself.”

01:14:03.038 --> 01:14:16.378
And this anti-life behaviour starts to such an extent, that they denied all that was spiritual, all that was healthy.

01:14:27.599 --> 01:14:32.299
Also on the left-hand side you had
some horrible writers and authors,

01:14:32.319 --> 01:14:33.779
who came on this earth

01:14:33.786 --> 01:14:38.400
to give you very, very,
very, very anti-life ideas;

01:14:49.072 --> 01:14:53.701
like a person like Sade, you see,
who started sadism and all that,

01:14:53.721 --> 01:14:56.231
this kind of people only
could prosper in France

01:14:56.261 --> 01:14:58.902
in India such a person
would have been thrown out.

01:15:05.001 --> 01:15:10.226
Some mad fellow might have written “Kama
Sutra” but I’ve never known that book,

01:15:10.227 --> 01:15:12.918
I’ve never read that book, I
don’t know anything about it

01:15:12.943 --> 01:15:16.478
and I don’t know if you ask anyone they’ll
say, “What is that book? We don’t know.”

01:15:31.693 --> 01:15:35.951
But if you say “Gita”, if you say “Ramayana”
you’ll find many or most of them.

01:15:42.778 --> 01:15:46.572
Even the Christians in India
won’t read such a book.

01:15:53.838 --> 01:15:58.092
Now, but these books were
very much appreciated.

01:15:58.083 --> 01:16:04.862
You find, it’s hard to find, anyone in Europe who’s educated and who has not read these books.

01:16:04.876 --> 01:16:07.376
It's like a Bible for them.

01:16:16.731 --> 01:16:22.377
I mean, all these things have made
them immune to sin, the filth of sin.

01:16:34.545 --> 01:16:37.255
To add to problems,
you had so many wars,

01:16:37.255 --> 01:16:41.485
but last war, France was occupied
by these horrible Germans.

01:16:49.434 --> 01:16:51.934
So, they were in complete fear,

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:59.692
again another left-sided movement.

01:17:04.758 --> 01:17:11.896
All these things have added to the
perpetuation of left sided problems.

01:17:18.099 --> 01:17:21.746
Now how to get rid of them is our problem.

01:17:25.096 --> 01:17:32.556
When I came here, Patrick told Me how they found people possessed by all kinds of variety of bhoots,

01:17:45.724 --> 01:17:50.846
and I’m not surprised because I was
expecting it sometimes to happen.

01:17:55.970 --> 01:18:01.070
There are still many Sahaja Yogis,
especially Yoginis, who are possessed.

01:18:08.441 --> 01:18:13.350
I know of one mad one who came to My
house, broke all the house and everything

01:18:13.369 --> 01:18:19.240
and did lot of things,
French, you know, a man.

01:18:36.703 --> 01:18:42.222
So, to get out of it, first of all
we must know the dangers of it.

01:18:45.041 --> 01:18:52.112
If the women go on like this, don’t obey
their leaders and go on with it, saying
that,  “This is my right”

01:18:52.083 --> 01:18:57.717
Don’t meditate and do all kinds of
things, they’ll become schizophrenic.

01:19:17.631 --> 01:19:22.211
The schizophrenia, according to
Me, according to Sahaja Yoga,

01:19:22.212 --> 01:19:30.252
is a disease in which you are permanently
possessed by many of these dead spirits,

01:19:42.657 --> 01:19:47.417
and in India they would be
sent to lunatic asylums.

01:19:50.925 --> 01:19:58.559
But I’m told that they have now cancelled
all lunatic asylums everywhere and the
lunatics are moving on the streets.

01:20:07.590 --> 01:20:10.090
It’s a very serious situation.

01:20:12.829 --> 01:20:17.224
The government doesn’t
realise what they’re doing.

01:20:23.859 --> 01:20:32.497
Once I travelled by bus in Paris and I saw one after another, people, one lady, then one gentleman

01:20:32.507 --> 01:20:38.099
then one other gentleman, they walked in, and they were talking to themselves loudly.

01:20:49.597 --> 01:20:53.428
They’re all possessed people
and they’ll possess you.

01:21:01.335 --> 01:21:06.781
They will possess you, they will possess your children, they can possess your pets, anyone.

01:21:12.170 --> 01:21:16.573
Such abnormal people should
be kept away from the public.

01:21:21.189 --> 01:21:27.639
But Marie told Me that, “You see, these French are very sympathetic towards them.”

01:21:33.068 --> 01:21:42.067
Their bhoots are also, I must tell you, the left sided people, they try to do things to incur your sympathies.

01:21:51.959 --> 01:21:58.454
In the right-sided people, as they are
aggressive to attract your attention,

01:21:58.468 --> 01:22:04.084
the left-sided people are aggressive to
themselves to attract your attention.

01:22:19.486 --> 01:22:29.476
So those people who think, “We can wear some scanty clothes in winter time, or we can torture our lives, stand on our heads,”

01:22:29.445 --> 01:22:38.532
all such people are  absolutely now passing
the limits of advertising department.

01:22:50.452 --> 01:22:57.910
So, the first things Sahaja Yogis have to remember that you have come on this earth to enjoy.

01:23:08.510 --> 01:23:09.030
Enjoy.

01:23:09.040 --> 01:23:09.870
In French!

01:23:09.870 --> 01:23:11.230
No, no French!

01:23:13.267 --> 01:23:15.767
Difficult Shri Mataji.

01:23:30.105 --> 01:23:37.235
Imagine, they said there is no word in French for enjoyment as I heard today, but for fun.

01:23:37.255 --> 01:23:38.215
Fun!

01:23:38.203 --> 01:23:40.263
Fun, they've found one, Shri Mataji.

01:23:40.278 --> 01:23:43.233
Found, Thank God!

01:23:43.248 --> 01:23:48.382
So, this is fun, you have
to enjoy the fun of life,

01:23:53.066 --> 01:23:57.292
and you are not here
to suffer any more.

01:23:57.302 --> 01:23:59.592
you’re not to suffer anymore.

01:24:02.803 --> 01:24:06.352
And to be serious – for what?

01:24:15.082 --> 01:24:23.870
And to be tense is out of, out of absolutely we can say, is out of subject, is useless to be tense.

01:24:23.879 --> 01:24:28.360
How can you be tense in the
atmosphere which is so relaxed?

01:24:33.924 --> 01:24:41.874
If these things are expressing themselves, then you should know you haven’t come to your proper point in Sahaja Yoga.

01:24:48.675 --> 01:24:55.015
If you still worry and go on worrying, you’ll go to the left and you’ll get out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:24:55.015 --> 01:24:57.515
This is the second serious point.

01:25:07.580 --> 01:25:14.340
So, the first point is that you’ll
become schizophrenic, mad, lunatics.

01:25:17.730 --> 01:25:18.768
That’s the first thing,

01:25:18.768 --> 01:25:21.268
I’m not a businessman so I’m
telling you the worst first.

01:25:38.818 --> 01:25:45.201
The second thing as just now I’ve told you will be that you’ll go out of Sahaja Yoga.

01:25:57.591 --> 01:26:03.695
As a result of that, you might
get any disease like cancer

01:26:08.307 --> 01:26:14.167
or any disease that comes from
the left side, there are so many.

01:26:19.415 --> 01:26:26.545
So, this is very important to see that you
try to keep to the central path of ascent,

01:26:35.288 --> 01:26:44.758
through curative methods, through meditative methods, through vibratory methods you must try to keep in the centre and don’t go to the right.

01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.710
Because with this destructive power,

01:26:58.692 --> 01:27:02.330
with this destructive power,
if you go to the right side,

01:27:02.330 --> 01:27:04.110
you will become extremely inauspicious

01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:06.620
and you’ll start destroying people,

01:27:12.839 --> 01:27:17.992
especially for the wives of leaders, I would like to tell them that they must become very humble,

01:27:18.004 --> 01:27:24.022
otherwise they will have this thing, a power by which they’ll destroy themselves and others.

01:27:34.989 --> 01:27:38.467
This is like this the power,
say, which is of a fire

01:27:38.444 --> 01:27:43.597
or of the light, if it is not
used for which it is made,

01:27:43.593 --> 01:27:50.046
supposing you put your hand
in the fire, it will burn,

01:28:01.886 --> 01:28:09.010
So, we must understand the power of
women is compassion, is nourishment,

01:28:15.053 --> 01:28:21.435
and they should not try to become like men, because then they’ll burn off people and burn off themselves.

01:28:31.532 --> 01:28:41.212
So, as I’ve told you before that it’s the women who can be very, very helpful in improving the left side.

01:28:47.376 --> 01:28:53.790
By dominating men, you make them left-sided which is not their style. They should not be left sided.

01:29:06.170 --> 01:29:11.019
But if they are truly men, they
will walk in the central path;

01:29:17.724 --> 01:29:22.724
and if women are truly women,
they’ll walk in the central path.

01:29:25.884 --> 01:29:28.484
So to walk in the central path

01:29:28.484 --> 01:29:30.984
one has to get rid of all these
things, of this type are within us.

01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:48.790
The third thing that really,
I would say, warn you people,

01:29:48.770 --> 01:29:52.320
that you get attached to your things

01:29:52.324 --> 01:29:56.156
to your possessions,

01:30:04.595 --> 01:30:06.536
to your children,

01:30:07.901 --> 01:30:11.121
to your surroundings:

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:17.291
like many French would say, “Oh,
I hate to go out of France.”

01:30:22.192 --> 01:30:26.053
When they go to some other
country they always criticise.

01:30:30.603 --> 01:30:35.163
I don’t know who are the best critics,
but all of them criticise each other;

01:30:37.629 --> 01:30:41.673
they never try to see the good points of others;

01:30:43.864 --> 01:30:49.517
and in doing so, what you do is to
perpetuate a kind of an inferiority on others

01:30:49.511 --> 01:30:56.981
using your powers of left side by
which you make others look small.

01:31:00.783 --> 01:31:04.523
Like pitying someone for nothing at all;

01:31:04.523 --> 01:31:08.013
like if supposing you start
pitying Me, what will it look like?

01:31:12.153 --> 01:31:14.533
It’s absurd as that!

01:31:14.553 --> 01:31:17.053
Yes Shri Mataji. I don’t even
know how to translate that.

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:19.571
I know, but that’s what it is.

01:31:44.929 --> 01:31:47.429
So there should be no pity,
there should be compassion,

01:31:50.197 --> 01:31:55.627
and that will take you out of this
nonsensical idea of pitying yourself,

01:31:55.627 --> 01:32:01.387
pitying others and feeling all
the time sorry for nothing at all;

01:32:06.345 --> 01:32:11.155
because if you ask for such
pity then you’ll be pitied too.

01:32:11.168 --> 01:32:13.668
I mean, you’ll be in a
pitiable condition yourself.

01:32:23.760 --> 01:32:28.469
But if you have compassion, then
you don’t put down that person,

01:32:28.469 --> 01:32:31.999
you don’t sort of make him feel inferior

01:32:32.029 --> 01:32:35.769
but you encourage him
and he feels powerful.

01:32:43.410 --> 01:32:45.180
Like a finger is hurt within you,

01:32:45.180 --> 01:32:49.830
you just try to soothe it and
be compassionate towards it.

01:32:49.822 --> 01:32:52.402
You don’t try to put him
down that “You’re no good,

01:32:52.403 --> 01:32:54.903
because he's part and
parcel of your being.

01:33:09.976 --> 01:33:14.423
So, the compassion stands in
between condemnation and pity.

01:33:22.509 --> 01:33:27.331
In compassion you have to
condemn whatever is wrong.

01:33:31.941 --> 01:33:36.553
You have to condemn the bhoots. You
have to condemn that’s ugliness’s.

01:33:38.471 --> 01:33:40.971
You have to condemn
all that is wrong.

01:33:43.454 --> 01:33:47.974
So, by that, you see,
you make that person see

01:33:47.964 --> 01:33:51.224
that you do not have appreciation

01:33:51.232 --> 01:33:56.767
of what he is at all and it is just
compassion and no pity about it;

01:34:07.902 --> 01:34:13.389
because the left-sided people want to be pitied and if you pity them, they get even worse.

01:34:24.237 --> 01:34:33.047
So, to say, “Poor person, poor man”, or
a “Poor old lady - something” is wrong.

01:34:41.370 --> 01:34:47.980
So when the people who are possessed
they start condemning their bhoots,

01:34:47.980 --> 01:34:49.935
they come up.

01:35:00.465 --> 01:35:05.924
When they hate their bhoots, they
can get rid of them in no time.

01:35:18.050 --> 01:35:22.577
But sometimes going worse than
that, they get identified.

01:35:29.051 --> 01:35:32.011
Of course to judge it, best
is to see through vibrations

01:35:32.001 --> 01:35:35.001
but you can also see it logically,

01:35:35.001 --> 01:35:40.391
how we behave towards our
possessions, towards others.

01:35:50.655 --> 01:35:54.915
Lot of work has been done in India
on a very subtle level, I would say,

01:35:54.935 --> 01:35:57.795
how to get out of the left side.

01:36:02.937 --> 01:36:07.467
I would say Mahavira was the one
who really has worked very hard

01:36:07.467 --> 01:36:13.807
to give the whole idea of the hell up
to heaven, what the left side is.

01:36:16.202 --> 01:36:19.992
Another, I would say, his own
incarnation, was William Blake,

01:36:19.992 --> 01:36:22.492
who has also given full idea about it.

01:36:25.337 --> 01:36:27.837
I would say Dante did the same.

01:36:30.612 --> 01:36:33.286
So, this is what they have shown you,

01:36:33.286 --> 01:36:36.826
how the hell is and
how the heavens are.

01:36:40.651 --> 01:36:45.252
Now for Sahaja Yogis, it is important
to see their left-sided problems

01:36:45.244 --> 01:36:47.744
if they are lingering in them.

01:36:51.324 --> 01:36:54.702
Possession means you’re
possessed by something,

01:36:54.683 --> 01:37:00.302
some ideas which are not
rational, which are illogical.

01:37:06.005 --> 01:37:10.333
And in the modern times, I’ve seen how
they avoid the topic if you ask them,

01:37:10.345 --> 01:37:13.143
they say, “I don’t know.”

01:37:18.871 --> 01:37:21.371
“I don’t know why I feel like
that,” then give up that feeling,

01:37:21.371 --> 01:37:23.871
it’s wrong; if you don’t
know, it’s no good.

01:37:29.683 --> 01:37:34.373
In the beginning you asked French, any French, “How are you?” they would say, like this.

01:37:34.386 --> 01:37:39.393
And I would look at their
hands, what does that mean?

01:37:48.226 --> 01:37:50.726
No, like this.

01:37:52.947 --> 01:37:57.435
So, I used to wonder, what’s
wrong with the hand!

01:38:08.458 --> 01:38:13.019
And they were very boastful about
it that’s the best part of it;

01:38:13.003 --> 01:38:15.968
because to say something as certain, cocksure,

01:38:15.976 --> 01:38:18.328
was regarded as ego for them perhaps,

01:38:18.324 --> 01:38:21.965
but Sahaja Yogis have to be cocksure.

01:38:29.014 --> 01:38:34.226
Now, English, if I ask them, “How are
you?” they would say, “Confused.”

01:38:40.872 --> 01:38:45.592
So, I mean, I didn’t know why,
and boastingly, “I’m confused,”

01:38:45.592 --> 01:38:48.092
as something great, you
know that “I’m confused.”

01:38:52.499 --> 01:38:57.230
So, the explanation was given, was
that, that we are aware of our state,

01:38:57.245 --> 01:39:00.290
we are not saying something
with a cocksure way.

01:39:09.683 --> 01:39:13.286
A Sahaja Yogi, if he is confused,
he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

01:39:19.423 --> 01:39:25.290
At this stage you have to be
absolutely sure of yourself,

01:39:28.587 --> 01:39:35.270
sure about Me, sure about Sahaja Yoga and sure about all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

01:39:40.132 --> 01:39:42.632
Otherwise you’re not Sahaja Yogis.

01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:56.993
That means your connection with God
is like a loose plug, like that.

01:40:04.827 --> 01:40:09.757
So, we have to understand that
in the centre when we are,

01:40:09.736 --> 01:40:14.027
we are sure of what we
are, absolutely sure.

01:40:18.195 --> 01:40:20.695
We raise our heads
in pride and glory.

01:40:26.376 --> 01:40:30.516
We don’t have the vanity of the
right and the pity of the left.

01:40:35.842 --> 01:40:41.105
That’s what is we are going
to achieve in France now.

01:40:44.959 --> 01:40:49.085
No more going to the sub-conscious
or to the collective sub-conscious.

01:40:53.131 --> 01:40:55.909
Now don’t think of your
forefathers what they did,

01:40:58.122 --> 01:41:02.515
nor think of the future, what
your progeny’s going to do.

01:41:07.608 --> 01:41:11.150
Think for yourself what you’re
going to do for both of them.

01:41:15.421 --> 01:41:22.327
Many cursed families can be completely
redeemed by one good Sahaja Yogi;

01:41:29.815 --> 01:41:35.183
and thousands of years of progeny
can be blessed by one Sahaja Yogi.

01:41:47.376 --> 01:41:52.001
That’s a fact, you can
feel the vibrations now.

01:41:54.492 --> 01:41:57.062
So, one should have that personality

01:41:57.062 --> 01:42:02.432
of a very tranquil, peaceful, understanding,

01:42:09.364 --> 01:42:15.155
but this understanding should not be
mental but a sap on your central path,

01:42:21.993 --> 01:42:29.235
the vital energy that nourishes all the
chakras, your being and the atmosphere.

01:42:34.849 --> 01:42:38.689
I’m sure all the French
Sahaja Yogis now

01:42:38.689 --> 01:42:42.459
will take to the new ways
of the central path.

01:42:51.658 --> 01:42:56.332
They should wear
dresses which are fresh,

01:42:56.346 --> 01:43:04.406
have fresh looks on their faces, should
create a fresh atmosphere around.

01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:13.577
Give up all worn-out things that,
they’re very fond of worn-out things,

01:43:13.577 --> 01:43:17.717
and also worn-out houses they
like, they say it is antique.

01:43:21.749 --> 01:43:25.396
Worn out clothes
and worn out houses!

01:43:36.749 --> 01:43:41.879
No, no give up that idea of antiques also

01:43:41.861 --> 01:43:45.419
because, you see antiques
are not all right

01:43:45.402 --> 01:43:47.902
as long as they are
preserved properly,

01:43:47.902 --> 01:43:54.237
but if you make them look like antiques,
you see, it's no respect given to them.

01:44:08.539 --> 01:44:14.149
I went to Poland and I was surprised
that all their old monuments

01:44:14.149 --> 01:44:16.649
were resurrected after the war

01:44:16.637 --> 01:44:21.544
and everything is painted and
brought back to absolute fresh look.

01:44:28.284 --> 01:44:34.752
They haven’t kept anything broken
or muddy or in any way worn-out.

01:44:49.434 --> 01:44:53.558
So, the idea of this antiques to
be preserved as they are

01:44:53.563 --> 01:44:57.584
is also, I think, very bhootish and left-sided.

01:45:04.985 --> 01:45:08.955
So, your antiques whatever you may
possess also must be cleaned out

01:45:08.942 --> 01:45:10.645
and properly done up

01:45:10.650 --> 01:45:14.098
and should be brought to a fresh look.

01:45:29.501 --> 01:45:32.939
Now this necklace I’m wearing
is very antique, very old,

01:45:32.937 --> 01:45:35.437
but doesn’t look old, does it?

01:45:40.845 --> 01:45:44.276
Because it is looked after and it would look funny

01:45:44.276 --> 01:45:51.607
to wear, for a Goddess, to wear a
antique thing which looks so worn out.

01:46:08.209 --> 01:46:14.528
So, one criteria could be that whatever
we wear or do, will Mother like it?

01:46:22.477 --> 01:46:24.069
This is the one question you can ask

01:46:24.072 --> 01:46:30.172
if you don’t want to ask the vibrations,
“Will She like it? We have to please Her.”

01:46:35.243 --> 01:46:38.223
And I tell you: very small,
small things please Me.

01:46:41.329 --> 01:46:46.772
You don’t have to do too many things,
just a few things which pleases Me,

01:46:46.772 --> 01:46:49.272
which are very simple and easy and innate

01:46:58.817 --> 01:47:01.317
Like you have to be innocent.

01:47:02.508 --> 01:47:06.452
It’s very easy if you are a child-like person,

01:47:06.452 --> 01:47:09.592
you just don’t allow any
cunning to come into your head,

01:47:09.577 --> 01:47:12.689
any absurd ideas, just be innocent;

01:47:12.693 --> 01:47:16.263
you don’t have to do
anything to be innocent.

01:47:23.366 --> 01:47:25.866
You have to do something
to be non-innocent.

01:47:30.988 --> 01:47:33.218
So, this is what one has to understand

01:47:33.238 --> 01:47:37.778
that the basis of our
left side is innocence.

01:47:42.747 --> 01:47:45.247
So, anything that is not
innocent, we should not do.

01:47:49.376 --> 01:47:51.474
It's so simple.

01:47:52.823 --> 01:47:57.033
should be all right with all of us

01:47:57.033 --> 01:48:04.133
if we just believe that we have this quality
of innocence within us absolutely intact,

01:48:11.003 --> 01:48:15.304
and you have to just awaken
it and enjoy it, that's all.

01:48:21.613 --> 01:48:23.804
So may God bless you all,

01:48:23.804 --> 01:48:27.744
may God give you
strength to be innocent.

01:48:36.084 --> 01:48:40.029
You must pray that
you should be innocent

01:48:46.318 --> 01:48:49.908
and the innocence will
suck in all your problems,

01:48:49.908 --> 01:48:52.408
suck in your the problems of the left side,

01:48:58.443 --> 01:49:04.291
and the symbol of innocence is Shri Ganesh,
who just knows His Mother, nobody else

01:49:11.795 --> 01:49:15.369
and His innocence is the
source of all the wisdom.

01:49:17.982 --> 01:49:23.935
So, you have to pray for becoming
absolutely innocent people.

01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:29.570
May God bless you.

01:49:34.226 --> 01:49:40.696
Shri Mataji, if I may draw Your
attention on this decoration.

01:49:40.702 --> 01:49:46.188
On this crest is the lily who is
the symbol of ancient France,

01:49:46.188 --> 01:49:51.128
who represents the flower of
purity in the French tradition

01:49:51.161 --> 01:49:54.368
and represents the kundalini which
goes through the Agnya Chakra

01:49:54.368 --> 01:49:58.769
with both ego and superego being
pushed and diminished on the side.

01:49:58.779 --> 01:50:02.429
And we pray, Shri Mataji, that that
should be the result of our innocence

01:50:02.448 --> 01:50:06.669
that we should all be beautiful
French lilies for You, Shri Mataji

01:50:06.688 --> 01:50:07.568
Thank you.

01:50:07.579 --> 01:50:10.079
Jai Shri Mataji!

01:50:31.401 --> 01:50:38.184
Now for the Puja, ask for
Patrick, his wife and ...

01:50:41.436 --> 01:50:43.936
You must get some people for Puja.

01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:52.042
Quite at length I spoke.

01:51:49.923 --> 01:51:53.913
All right, now we should get the
children to wash My Feet. It's the best

01:51:53.903 --> 01:51:56.403
Have you got warm water?

01:52:08.969 --> 01:52:11.469
Ah, come along.That's very few.

01:52:16.199 --> 01:52:18.699
Four say, at a time.

01:52:24.075 --> 01:52:27.925
No, start it from younger
to the eldest. Younger!

01:52:38.489 --> 01:52:40.989
Four of them, youngest.

01:53:06.051 --> 01:53:08.551
Who got you this nice dress?

01:53:14.952 --> 01:53:16.553
Her mummy bought it.

01:53:17.675 --> 01:53:20.423
Oh, that's great.

01:53:20.453 --> 01:53:22.676
Now can you move this side?

01:53:22.676 --> 01:53:25.496
Now what you have to do is
to pour water from there.

01:53:25.495 --> 01:53:27.995
Will you guide the
children how to wash it.

01:53:27.995 --> 01:53:30.495
Can you bring the hot water here?

01:53:34.960 --> 01:53:37.460
Nice lecture on that. It was good.

01:53:37.460 --> 01:53:42.280
The left side will be clearing
out. It's quite clear now.

01:53:47.970 --> 01:53:53.250
Now, who will say the mantra of the Ganesha?

01:53:54.553 --> 01:53:57.845
You can't say it in English?
Warren you can say it in English.

01:53:57.869 --> 01:54:00.369
Have you got it written out?

01:54:13.825 --> 01:54:16.325
What's he saying?

03:23:56.369 --> 03:23:58.869
May God bless you all.

03:24:04.923 --> 03:24:07.423
May God bless you.

03:25:11.872 --> 03:25:14.372
Shri Mataji would like...

03:25:21.844 --> 03:25:29.315
Shri Mataji will let this bird
fly free when She will leave the room.

03:26:14.172 --> 03:26:19.932
Shri Mataji we tried to find some present
for You and then we had this story.

03:26:19.932 --> 03:26:27.920
When we have been looking (unclear)....
imagine we get no "made in France."

03:26:27.925 --> 03:26:35.210
and we've been so pleased with the
music that the Swiss Sahaja yogis

03:26:35.230 --> 03:26:41.969
could play for you. This Music
Box is coming from Switzerland.

03:27:49.983 --> 03:27:52.483
What an idea!

03:27:59.440 --> 03:28:01.940
You can all hear it?

03:28:07.138 --> 03:28:09.638
Beautiful!

03:28:12.404 --> 03:28:14.904
Very nice! Very fine one!

03:28:19.604 --> 03:28:21.818
It is made in Switzerland?

03:28:21.818 --> 03:28:23.148
Yes Mother.

03:28:26.237 --> 03:28:28.737
They make something nice also.

03:28:34.435 --> 03:28:36.935
Thank you very much..

03:28:51.331 --> 03:28:57.971
For the second present Mother, we still
catch because it was not made in France.

03:28:57.974 --> 03:29:01.551
Swiss give us the desire

03:29:01.561 --> 03:29:05.594
to sing and to play music for you

03:29:05.599 --> 03:29:12.826
and in Italy, they give us the
desire to be sweet with our Mother

03:29:12.839 --> 03:29:19.819
and this present for Your new
house, is made in Italy.

03:29:51.258 --> 03:29:53.758
Beautiful!

03:29:56.460 --> 03:29:58.960
Very beautiful.

03:30:01.921 --> 03:30:04.421
Very beautiful!

03:30:05.629 --> 03:30:07.689
Thank you very much.

03:30:07.692 --> 03:30:11.799
It's very thoughtful,

03:30:11.814 --> 03:30:18.324
because I've seen that you have appreciated.

03:30:18.338 --> 03:30:22.304
I was actually appreciating this
kind of work on the cotton

03:30:22.304 --> 03:30:28.024
and they should remember
and... really remarkable!

03:30:33.621 --> 03:30:36.121
Here is a present for all the yogis.

03:30:36.674 --> 03:30:40.661
Instead of the usual picture it's a song booklet.

03:31:09.956 --> 03:31:14.327
The booklet that Mother is
reading now, is a song booklet,

03:31:14.327 --> 03:31:19.328
that will be offered to you
from the French Sahaja Yogis,

03:31:19.359 --> 03:31:22.468
to thank you for  your coming here today.

03:31:31.092 --> 03:31:36.028
Shri Mataji, this is the
booklet, that we have prepared

03:31:36.032 --> 03:31:38.532
for the newcomers in Sahaja Yoga

03:31:39.483 --> 03:31:40.333
Oh, very good

03:31:40.368 --> 03:31:42.993
to give them at the Public
Programmes and the follow ups.

03:31:49.120 --> 03:31:51.620
I must tell you a little story.

03:31:51.627 --> 03:32:01.217
We got Mother, the two cards that have been made in the same time and we had a little problem with printing, but just look at the result.

03:32:01.217 --> 03:32:07.164
The result is that there is this red line coming out of the feet of Shri Ganesh

03:32:07.170 --> 03:32:09.490
and they are coming out of Your Feet.

03:32:09.490 --> 03:32:11.990
Which red line?

03:32:14.392 --> 03:32:18.340
Ah that's good!

03:32:18.375 --> 03:32:21.550
The vibrations are coming.

03:32:21.548 --> 03:32:24.048
So beautiful!

03:32:52.460 --> 03:32:56.910
this cushion has been made by
all the Paris Sahaja Yoginis,

03:32:56.923 --> 03:33:02.043
Everyone of them, just made a
little piece of it for You, Mother.

03:33:12.853 --> 03:33:17.693
Shri Mataji for the Public Programme
we've made this Press Booklet

03:33:17.726 --> 03:33:20.516
and we hope, with Your help, that

03:33:20.496 --> 03:33:26.986
journalists will come and have
their normal job they have to do.

03:33:53.822 --> 03:33:56.322
Very nice!

03:34:22.342 --> 03:34:30.042
Mother, we have some ... vineyard plant.

03:34:32.214 --> 03:34:36.887
So that no wine can grow in France
any more, only grape juice.

03:34:36.887 --> 03:34:42.629
Only grape juice in France,
in Italy and in Spain!

03:35:16.844 --> 03:35:20.816
Here is a present from
Alsace Sahaja Yogis, Mother.

03:35:46.446 --> 03:35:53.345
Shri Mataji I saw so many Sahaja Yogi children have a little present for you.

03:35:53.346 --> 03:35:57.116
The children have a lot of presents
for you, a lot of drawings.

03:35:57.116 --> 03:36:02.046
You can say they are presents,
the children are the best presents.

03:36:02.914 --> 03:36:05.414
Look at them.

03:36:55.812 --> 03:37:00.340
On the cloth is written in
Marathi, Jai Shri Mataji.

03:37:43.851 --> 03:37:49.581
All of them have done a good
job. Very beautiful integrated job!

03:37:49.573 --> 03:37:55.369
Mother, everyone expects You  in Colmar for this seminar and You were there on vibrations.

03:37:55.369 --> 03:38:03.045
and we get this little souvenir
from Colmar Seminar for you.

03:38:15.078 --> 03:38:17.578
Made in France.

03:38:17.578 --> 03:38:20.078
Yes, hand made in Alsace.

03:38:20.963 --> 03:38:23.463
From that place only.

03:38:24.369 --> 03:38:26.869
Thank you very much.

03:38:39.589 --> 03:38:41.479
It is from where?

03:38:41.477 --> 03:38:44.529
Present from Montpellier, Mother.

03:38:44.539 --> 03:38:47.889
Thank you. They're all
doing such a good job.

03:38:49.164 --> 03:38:51.664
Please open for Me.

03:38:57.441 --> 03:39:01.114
I'm sorry I won't be able to
come, but may be later on.

03:39:01.114 --> 03:39:04.324
I might try but just now I don't think.

03:39:07.707 --> 03:39:10.207
Everyday I'm booked now.

03:39:15.230 --> 03:39:17.730
Oh what a beauty!

03:39:22.068 --> 03:39:24.568
It's a shawl! What a beauty!

03:39:25.195 --> 03:39:27.098
A shawl.

03:39:42.296 --> 03:39:44.796
It is lovely!

03:39:50.831 --> 03:39:53.331
Just look! The  symbol of kundalini.

03:40:03.136 --> 03:40:05.486
Very nice, delicate and beautifully done.

03:40:05.486 --> 03:40:07.986
Kundalini is that beautiful.

03:40:33.168 --> 03:40:35.668
Still on? How many things?

03:40:35.662 --> 03:40:40.278
I'll have to take one box again.

03:40:46.143 --> 03:40:48.273
I can see.  It's beautiful!

03:40:48.293 --> 03:40:50.793
Done with hands?

03:40:50.803 --> 03:40:54.273
Thank you very much. Who's
brought this? From whom?

03:40:59.321 --> 03:41:01.171
Very beautiful.

03:41:01.161 --> 03:41:03.151
Thank you very much,
I'll always use it.

03:41:03.151 --> 03:41:08.390
See this is made hearts here. All hearts,
hearts, hearts, of all the Sahaja Yogis!

03:41:08.401 --> 03:41:12.422
I can always use it in my travelling also. It's beautiful!

03:41:43.188 --> 03:41:45.688
Very beautiful, very beautiful!

03:41:46.790 --> 03:41:49.290
Oh thank you.  From whom?

03:41:49.290 --> 03:41:51.790
From the children, in the
name of all the children.

03:41:58.116 --> 03:41:59.439
All the children.

03:41:59.449 --> 03:42:04.799
There are two of those Mother.
The first one was under the music box.

03:42:04.799 --> 03:42:06.279
This is the second one.

03:42:06.282 --> 03:42:08.782
From the children is the sweet one.

03:42:08.782 --> 03:42:11.282
Thank you.

03:42:16.092 --> 03:42:17.572
This one, from whom?

03:42:24.814 --> 03:42:25.782
Sweets!

03:42:27.861 --> 03:42:30.361
It's very good for the throat,

03:42:34.331 --> 03:42:35.371
Thank you very much.

03:42:36.480 --> 03:42:38.256
From whom?

03:42:38.280 --> 03:42:39.196
From Nantes.

03:42:49.185 --> 03:42:51.052
Shri Mataji , Nicola!

03:42:51.883 --> 03:42:54.383
A little present for you Mother.

03:42:59.195 --> 03:43:00.515
Everybody giving me things.

03:43:00.535 --> 03:43:02.065
Now this is too much.

03:43:02.041 --> 03:43:04.541
It's too much to give. This is too much.

03:43:04.552 --> 03:43:07.475
She is hiding behind her baby, Shri Mataji.

03:43:09.685 --> 03:43:12.185
This is too much.

03:43:27.950 --> 03:43:32.290
Now just see, I'm not supposed to take anything. I'm 'Asang.'

03:43:32.295 --> 03:43:35.099
The One Who dosen't take anything from anyone.

03:43:35.120 --> 03:43:37.199
It already belongs to You Shri Mataji

03:43:37.199 --> 03:43:41.469
so You don't think in that way.

03:44:05.862 --> 03:44:07.426
How beautiful!

03:44:15.707 --> 03:44:18.207
Thank you very much.

03:44:20.574 --> 03:44:23.074
Let the children bring their paintings.

03:45:07.488 --> 03:45:09.988
Such talent I think!

03:45:41.588 --> 03:45:44.088
See the joy!

03:46:17.922 --> 03:46:20.652
Is it a future ashram for France?

03:46:20.652 --> 03:46:22.972
I think so!

03:46:23.002 --> 03:46:25.502
They are expressive.

03:46:50.620 --> 03:46:53.820
This must be kept for
exhibitions when we have.

03:46:53.810 --> 03:46:57.910
You see children's paintings be kept
for the exhibitions when we have.

03:46:57.933 --> 03:47:00.433
It would be nice, but I hope they
have written the names or not.

03:47:01.726 --> 03:47:04.376
Have you written the names?

03:47:05.650 --> 03:47:08.150
No, no you'd better
write and your age also.

03:47:28.792 --> 03:47:31.292
So thank you very much.

03:47:34.150 --> 03:47:41.420
Six months ago, two people from Australia
went to a country called Sierra Leone.

03:47:41.410 --> 03:47:43.370
As this is a French Puja,

03:47:43.366 --> 03:47:45.610
this is an appropriate
time to present Mother

03:47:45.610 --> 03:47:48.936
for the symbol of what
has been started there

03:47:48.950 --> 03:47:54.970
already there are 21 Sahaja Yogis, African
Sahaja Yogis, established in Sierra Leone.

03:48:47.640 --> 03:48:50.140
I say that it is appropriate that
this should be announced in France

03:48:50.140 --> 03:48:52.937
which has a special
relationship with Africa.

03:48:52.927 --> 03:48:57.840
Probably for the left
swadisthan Shri Mataji.

03:49:01.477 --> 03:49:05.254
But we are starting from the
roots so we will be all right.

03:49:47.662 --> 03:49:50.162
Ah! There's another one.

03:49:50.165 --> 03:49:52.665
Oh, beautiful this one is! Very beautiful.

03:50:10.404 --> 03:50:12.904
Oh beautiful! such a nice thing.
