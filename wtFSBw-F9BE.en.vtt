00:00:00.478 --> 00:00:04.617
One has to realize that

00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:10.136
modern times are the times of confusion.

00:00:10.834 --> 00:00:13.104
You don't know what you want.

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.364
You don't know what you want to ask.

00:00:18.034 --> 00:00:23.961
You don't know whatever you are doing is right or wrong.

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:29.382
Confusion is necessary.

00:00:29.582 --> 00:00:32.983
Without confusion, we are not desperate.

00:00:33.183 --> 00:00:38.195
Without desperation we do not seek.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:46.230
But confusion is only visible

00:00:46.438 --> 00:00:52.489
when a person reaches a certain area of awareness

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:56.935
or we can say a degree of awareness.

00:00:57.135 --> 00:01:02.019
Say, at a stage when Moses came on this earth

00:01:02.446 --> 00:01:05.547
when the desperation was different,

00:01:05.747 --> 00:01:11.827
that they wanted to get out of slavery.

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:19.333
It was a different style of understanding they had.

00:01:20.494 --> 00:01:25.624
How to organize a society on a particular pattern

00:01:25.824 --> 00:01:34.984
so you achieve the maximum amount of efficiency out of that society.

00:01:35.721 --> 00:01:38.489
And it was an emergency.

00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:50.536
It was a very touch and go position for the Jews at that time.

00:01:51.621 --> 00:01:56.672
It has happened in many countries, in many generations,

00:01:56.918 --> 00:02:03.312
that they reached a state where they felt extremely desperate.

00:02:03.512 --> 00:02:10.686
The slavery of man was very apparent at that time.

00:02:10.886 --> 00:02:14.132
But before that, people didn't feel bad about the slavery.

00:02:14.332 --> 00:02:17.781
They had accepted it. They had taken it for granted.

00:02:17.981 --> 00:02:21.571
And then a time came when they felt, "This is slavery,

00:02:21.771 --> 00:02:25.126
and we are not going to have any more of it."

00:02:27.317 --> 00:02:32.237
And a leader came. That leader worked it out for them.

00:02:32.581 --> 00:02:37.701
Today in these modern times we have a very subtle type of slavery

00:02:37.948 --> 00:02:40.847
which is every day eating us,

00:02:41.047 --> 00:02:43.280
which is so self-destroying

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.720
that we are not even aware of it, and we get destroyed.

00:02:48.755 --> 00:02:54.115
This destruction is working in so many ways

00:02:56.432 --> 00:03:03.571
that, if we do not really awaken ourselves to the truth,

00:03:04.575 --> 00:03:11.135
there is a possibility that nothing will be left out of this creation.

00:03:11.624 --> 00:03:14.852
There are people who give big lectures.

00:03:15.052 --> 00:03:18.649
I have met many big people from United Nations

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.213
and from all these big, big agencies.

00:03:22.456 --> 00:03:26.895
They talk about the coming destruction, the future shock,

00:03:27.107 --> 00:03:29.600
and this going to happen. They book big books. They discuss.

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.440
They sit on the street, they'll discuss.

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.628
They are in a pub, they are discussing.

00:03:33.828 --> 00:03:36.210
They are in a party, they are discussing.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.694
But they do not realize what it means.

00:03:39.894 --> 00:03:45.134
This destruction is a kind of a destruction

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:49.002
that has never taken before.

00:03:50.407 --> 00:03:53.807
Because this destruction is going to come from within

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:56.442
and not from without.

00:03:57.397 --> 00:04:02.593
We have reached a certain depth in our awareness.

00:04:02.821 --> 00:04:09.074
And if we do not touch the source of our sustenance,

00:04:09.768 --> 00:04:13.448
this destruction is going to work out.

00:04:13.648 --> 00:04:16.285
Now for many people it is, "Oh forget it, forget it.

00:04:16.485 --> 00:04:18.151
We'll see about it."

00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:21.090
Some people are of this opinion, "All right. Forget it. What?

00:04:21.254 --> 00:04:23.312
Destruction? All right. Doesn't matter

00:04:23.456 --> 00:04:25.805
We'll see tomorrow."

00:04:25.935 --> 00:04:29.655
And some of them I've seen are sitting down waiting,

00:04:29.881 --> 00:04:33.806
"Oh God, thank God there's destruction, so this all is finished. Ha!

00:04:34.006 --> 00:04:35.786
We don't have to bother our heads.

00:04:35.986 --> 00:04:38.543
Thank God, there is destruction promised."

00:04:41.444 --> 00:04:46.745
Whatever attitude one may take, one has to realize

00:04:46.984 --> 00:04:50.304
that these are very serious things.

00:04:50.927 --> 00:04:55.838
The creation has reached its maximum growth now.

00:04:56.038 --> 00:05:01.558
The growth is expressed as human beings.

00:05:01.769 --> 00:05:06.329
These human beings are the actors on the stage.

00:05:06.956 --> 00:05:13.197
Whole nature is working out this new happening.

00:05:14.586 --> 00:05:18.520
Now only one thing has to happen to you is

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:24.012
that you have to get connected with the Divine.

00:05:24.212 --> 00:05:27.772
You have to get connected with the whole.

00:05:28.501 --> 00:05:36.301
You have to know your own meaning, and you have to know your purpose.

00:05:36.623 --> 00:05:45.423
If this can happen to you, then you are in the other world.

00:05:46.126 --> 00:05:48.221
You are made for this.

00:05:48.421 --> 00:05:50.593
You are made a human being with a purpose.

00:05:50.793 --> 00:05:51.790
We must think.

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:55.590
All the scientists must ask once at least this question, "Why?

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.287
Why are we made human beings?

00:06:00.487 --> 00:06:05.407
From animal stage, why have we come to this stage? What is the reason?"

00:06:07.728 --> 00:06:12.160
This question is working in the unconscious of every seeker today.

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.536
That's how we have so many seekers all over the world.

00:06:16.736 --> 00:06:21.696
And these seekers are just trying to find out why are we here.

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:30.593
Some of them find an answer sometimes in some material well-being.

00:06:30.793 --> 00:06:34.593
Say our strikes nowadays - railways.

00:06:34.894 --> 00:06:40.974
Well it's very narrow view of the whole thing - very narrow view.

00:06:41.334 --> 00:06:44.278
"You want to have more pay? All right, have it."

00:06:44.478 --> 00:06:46.238
Then what?

00:06:46.707 --> 00:06:48.572
Those who talk of communism...

00:06:48.772 --> 00:06:51.169
I've been to Moscow, I am again going back.

00:06:51.371 --> 00:06:55.950
I mean if you ask them they say, "Oh we haven't got joy as yet."

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.814
I am not against communism or against democracy.

00:06:59.041 --> 00:07:02.169
Both things are just jokes to Me.

00:07:02.369 --> 00:07:06.369
You are neither communistic nor democratic.

00:07:06.876 --> 00:07:12.142
Only after realization you can become both simultaneously.

00:07:12.342 --> 00:07:15.379
Because you have no powers to be capitalistic or democratic,

00:07:15.579 --> 00:07:17.087
you have no power to vote.

00:07:17.287 --> 00:07:19.625
You don't know anything about yourself. What are you voting for?

00:07:19.825 --> 00:07:21.523
You can't see.

00:07:21.723 --> 00:07:28.803
Unless and until there is light, unless and until we can see,

00:07:29.207 --> 00:07:31.847
how are we going to vote for?

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.339
For example we vote a person - for what?

00:07:35.539 --> 00:07:38.597
"Oh! He's a very nice man," all right.

00:07:39.005 --> 00:07:41.540
What is nice about him?

00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:44.180
How do you know he's a nice man?

00:07:44.774 --> 00:07:47.652
How do you know he will not be a bad man?

00:07:47.852 --> 00:07:52.861
Can you say that today the one who looks like a nice, a very nice person,

00:07:53.061 --> 00:07:59.034
will not emit scorpions or snakes all around him?

00:07:59.459 --> 00:08:03.378
A person who apparently looks a beautiful personality

00:08:03.578 --> 00:08:06.345
may turn out to be a horrid person.

00:08:06.545 --> 00:08:09.588
There is no absolute way of judging anyone.

00:08:09.788 --> 00:08:12.919
So how are we to vote any?

00:08:14.726 --> 00:08:19.711
If you think that you know how to judge,

00:08:19.911 --> 00:08:24.231
then, I think, you have to still learned.

00:08:24.641 --> 00:08:27.944
Because still you make lots of mistakes, you will not admit that

00:08:28.144 --> 00:08:30.292
"I don't know." That's the point.

00:08:30.492 --> 00:08:33.243
Once you reach that state of saying, "I don't know.

00:08:33.443 --> 00:08:36.540
I say this is a nice man, but I can't say.

00:08:36.741 --> 00:08:38.613
I'm not sure about this person."

00:08:38.813 --> 00:08:43.037
That's the point where you reach, when you are unsure about it.

00:08:43.237 --> 00:08:49.917
that you want to know surely if something is really truthful and honest.

00:08:50.718 --> 00:08:55.056
Our sense of honesty and everything is so superficial -

00:08:55.256 --> 00:08:56.990
is so superficial.

00:08:57.190 --> 00:08:59.608
For us, honesty means if you give me five pounds,

00:08:59.808 --> 00:09:01.844
I'll return five pounds to you.

00:09:02.044 --> 00:09:04.482
Is done. Finished. It's honest.

00:09:05.032 --> 00:09:07.912
Everything is so superficial.

00:09:08.115 --> 00:09:12.060
That's why we can never be satisfied.

00:09:12.298 --> 00:09:17.298
Even if you get ten percent more pay or twenty percent more pay,

00:09:17.579 --> 00:09:21.207
you are not going to be happy. Take it from Me.

00:09:21.407 --> 00:09:25.589
Material things do not give us happiness. Never.

00:09:25.789 --> 00:09:29.850
But I do not say that we do not need material things.

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.650
We need material things.

00:09:33.551 --> 00:09:41.733
But matter is something like a cup which has the nectar in it.

00:09:42.178 --> 00:09:48.077
If you are thirsty, you cannot take it from an empty cup, anything.

00:09:48.277 --> 00:09:52.461
It may be a cup of gold, what does it matter, difference to you?

00:09:52.661 --> 00:09:56.498
You must have something to quench your thirst.

00:09:56.698 --> 00:10:01.158
And that thirst, unless and until it is quenched,

00:10:02.551 --> 00:10:04.616
you are not going to be happy.

00:10:04.821 --> 00:10:06.791
And what is that thirst?

00:10:07.041 --> 00:10:11.317
Is this that still you have not known yourself.

00:10:11.517 --> 00:10:16.876
It's a very unconscious thirst.

00:10:17.076 --> 00:10:19.675
It comes - you don't know what you are seeking.

00:10:19.875 --> 00:10:21.903
You don't know why you are unhappy,

00:10:22.103 --> 00:10:24.568
you don't know what you want.

00:10:24.768 --> 00:10:28.428
That is the unconscious which is working it out.

00:10:28.628 --> 00:10:33.216
But the time has come that you should know what you are,

00:10:33.416 --> 00:10:36.680
and what is your glory, what is your greatness,

00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:38.470
what are your powers.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.717
They're all built within yourself.

00:10:41.917 --> 00:10:47.621
All these days when you grew up in your evolutionary process,

00:10:47.821 --> 00:10:52.136
all these things were built within you as shown here.

00:10:52.336 --> 00:10:54.776
They are all there.

00:10:55.009 --> 00:10:59.089
Actually I am just a catalyst you can say.

00:10:59.534 --> 00:11:03.183
Just a candle which is enlightened.

00:11:03.383 --> 00:11:06.983
And this candle, when touches another candle which is ready,

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:08.859
that gets enlightened.

00:11:09.059 --> 00:11:12.008
I mean you may give it a big scientific name,

00:11:12.208 --> 00:11:14.031
and charged personality, this, that.

00:11:14.231 --> 00:11:15.423
I don't understand.

00:11:15.623 --> 00:11:17.397
It's very simple for Me.

00:11:17.597 --> 00:11:19.591
We are all ready for it.

00:11:19.791 --> 00:11:23.618
I just touch you and you get enlightened, and you get the light,

00:11:23.818 --> 00:11:27.556
and when you touch someone, that person also gets enlightened.

00:11:28.245 --> 00:11:31.477
Now you may say,"Mother how can that be so simple?"

00:11:31.677 --> 00:11:34.436
I mean so many people say that,"Mother You are too simple.

00:11:34.636 --> 00:11:35.779
How can that be?"

00:11:35.979 --> 00:11:37.934
I just don't understand. What should I have?

00:11:38.134 --> 00:11:41.113
Two horns or something to make it complicate?

00:11:41.313 --> 00:11:44.533
Everything that is living is the simplest thing.

00:11:44.733 --> 00:11:47.170
That's the sign of living.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:49.707
Have you seen the flower?

00:11:49.907 --> 00:11:54.048
How simple it is to grow a flower.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.260
It just works.

00:11:56.534 --> 00:12:02.299
You just get some seeds, sow them, and you get the plants.

00:12:02.499 --> 00:12:06.900
How simple it is. Do we ever think how it works out?

00:12:07.131 --> 00:12:10.011
It looks very complicated if you start thinking about it.

00:12:10.259 --> 00:12:12.853
You will go mad if you start analyzing it.

00:12:13.053 --> 00:12:14.367
But it's so simple.

00:12:14.581 --> 00:12:19.341
In the same way, this happening is also a very, very simple thing.

00:12:19.565 --> 00:12:21.897
It is called "sahaja".

00:12:22.097 --> 00:12:24.200
Sahaja has two meanings. Sahaja means "simple",

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:27.520
also it means "the thing that is born with you."

00:12:27.756 --> 00:12:31.584
Sahaja is a simple thing because it is born with you.

00:12:31.784 --> 00:12:35.279
I mean your nose is born with you. All right, it's a simple thing.

00:12:35.479 --> 00:12:37.477
You don't have to do anything, press it

00:12:37.677 --> 00:12:40.241
or anyway do anything to it to breathe.

00:12:40.441 --> 00:12:41.549
It's there.

00:12:41.749 --> 00:12:47.063
In the same way this built in process is within you.

00:12:47.286 --> 00:12:48.582
It's just there.

00:12:48.782 --> 00:12:51.108
To Me it is absolutely simple,

00:12:51.308 --> 00:12:56.057
and to you also it will be simple as soon as you get it.

00:12:57.055 --> 00:13:01.385
So this argument about it being so simple

00:13:02.238 --> 00:13:05.012
I just can't understand, Myself.

00:13:05.212 --> 00:13:06.823
Why should there be an argument?

00:13:07.052 --> 00:13:09.126
Supposing you can eat this way

00:13:09.326 --> 00:13:12.318
why should ask that, "How can it be so simple to eat this way?"

00:13:12.518 --> 00:13:17.597
It's so simple because it is so vital. It is so important.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:21.887
All vital things are simple and easily available,

00:13:22.087 --> 00:13:26.160
Like your own breathing.For that if you have to do something special,

00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:29.109
then this breathing is not possible.

00:13:29.309 --> 00:13:31.705
How many people are going to survive?

00:13:31.905 --> 00:13:35.465
Now this simple thing, this simple method,

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:40.288
is the method of the all-pervading Divine Power,

00:13:40.488 --> 00:13:42.762
the Holy Ghost.

00:13:42.962 --> 00:13:46.545
This all-pervading Divine Power

00:13:46.745 --> 00:13:52.152
is the Shakti, the Primordial Power that works it out.

00:13:52.671 --> 00:13:56.451
Do we realize how this Shakti works otherwise

00:13:56.651 --> 00:14:01.916
are we ever watching a flower becoming a fruit?

00:14:02.116 --> 00:14:04.634
Who does that? Not one flower.

00:14:04.834 --> 00:14:08.848
But you must have seen millions and millions and billions and billions

00:14:09.048 --> 00:14:12.121
of these flowers are turning into fruits.

00:14:12.321 --> 00:14:15.211
And who does that? We never think.

00:14:15.475 --> 00:14:17.231
We take it for granted.

00:14:17.431 --> 00:14:21.093
All living things are done by this Divine Power.

00:14:21.293 --> 00:14:24.427
Human beings cannot do anything that is living.

00:14:24.627 --> 00:14:27.049
What they can do is everything that is dead

00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:31.035
or deadening. Like strikes is a deadening thing.

00:14:31.510 --> 00:14:35.150
What we can do is to make something a table, a chair,

00:14:35.350 --> 00:14:36.836
if the tree is dead.

00:14:37.036 --> 00:14:38.882
We are doing nothing but dead work.

00:14:39.082 --> 00:14:47.922
And this deadening thing dominates us because we form habits.

00:14:48.515 --> 00:14:54.305
We form habits. With these habits this matter sits on our head.

00:14:54.505 --> 00:14:57.756
And the spirit which is the vibrant thing,

00:14:57.967 --> 00:15:05.647
which is the source, which is the controlling thing, becomes dormant.

00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:14.712
This dormant force if somehow becomes enlightened,

00:15:14.912 --> 00:15:20.296
and our attention becomes enlightened, our attention becomes enlightened,

00:15:20.692 --> 00:15:24.374
we become a different person. We become a Yogi.

00:15:24.574 --> 00:15:27.320
We become a person who is united with God.

00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:30.328
For that you don't have to wear funny dresses.

00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:33.353
It makes no difference what sort of dress you wear.

00:15:33.558 --> 00:15:37.228
It makes no difference how you comb your hair

00:15:37.439 --> 00:15:39.046
or what sort of food you eat.

00:15:39.246 --> 00:15:41.306
It is something so within.

00:15:41.506 --> 00:15:45.746
It has nothing to do with these outward things.

00:15:45.957 --> 00:15:52.457
All our ideas about even charities, and about being kind to others,

00:15:52.669 --> 00:15:57.035
and all these things are very superficial.

00:15:57.638 --> 00:16:04.796
When you become light, when you become compassion, when you become love,

00:16:05.126 --> 00:16:07.241
then you don't have to tell yourself at all.

00:16:07.441 --> 00:16:08.750
You don't have to argue with it.

00:16:08.950 --> 00:16:12.989
You just become. It just flows. The compassion flows, it acts.

00:16:14.028 --> 00:16:16.960
You don't have to argue it out. You don't have to tell yourself,

00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:19.116
"I should be compassionate, I should be kind."

00:16:19.316 --> 00:16:21.876
You just become.

00:16:22.892 --> 00:16:26.540
I went to Italy and there were three, four people

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:29.301
who got interested in Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:29.550 --> 00:16:32.019
But they said, "We don't want to join Sahaja Yoga."

00:16:32.256 --> 00:16:33.201
I said, "Why?"

00:16:33.401 --> 00:16:35.041
"Because these people don't smoke."

00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:38.438
I said, "I never told them not to smoke, never. Ask them, did I?"

00:16:38.638 --> 00:16:40.673
I never said, "Don't smoke."

00:16:40.873 --> 00:16:48.512
You just ask them, "Do you smoke, or you have given up smoking,

00:16:48.737 --> 00:16:52.019
or your Mother has forced you not to smoke?"

00:16:52.219 --> 00:16:53.610
They said, "Nothing of the kind.

00:16:53.866 --> 00:16:57.066
We used to smoke packets of cigarettes.

00:16:57.321 --> 00:17:00.080
We used to drink, we were drug addicts.

00:17:00.398 --> 00:17:03.910
But something happened to us. We just gave up, we don't know how.

00:17:04.110 --> 00:17:05.270
So subtle.

00:17:06.279 --> 00:17:10.369
Mother never told us. We just became like that.

00:17:12.485 --> 00:17:14.590
What is there to tell? I mean, once you have found it,

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.030
once you have seen the light,

00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:17.505
you are not bothered.

00:17:17.705 --> 00:17:20.066
Supposing you see a rope here.

00:17:20.266 --> 00:17:22.881
You might be frightened, you might think it's a snake.

00:17:23.081 --> 00:17:25.166
Because there's no light, you can't see.

00:17:25.366 --> 00:17:27.040
You might be running helter-skelter,

00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:29.194
the whole house might be upside down.

00:17:29.394 --> 00:17:32.423
But once a light is there you say, Oh! It's a rope. All right.

00:17:32.623 --> 00:17:37.324
So all the fears drop out, because you have seen it.

00:17:40.037 --> 00:17:46.717
All the pressures drop out. All the hang-ups, they drop out.

00:17:47.766 --> 00:17:50.622
Whatever is abnormal drops out.

00:17:50.822 --> 00:17:54.209
And you become an absolutely a normal person,

00:17:54.409 --> 00:17:57.729
absolutely a normal person.

00:17:57.930 --> 00:18:02.039
That's what it is that you have to become.

00:18:02.239 --> 00:18:05.788
But it is much, much more than that.

00:18:06.225 --> 00:18:09.108
This is not only that you get your physical fitness.

00:18:09.308 --> 00:18:10.665
Many people have been cured.

00:18:10.865 --> 00:18:12.904
They must have told you that cancer is cured.

00:18:13.104 --> 00:18:15.008
Yes, true, cancer is cured.

00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:17.578
Many diseases are cured.

00:18:18.433 --> 00:18:20.520
Mental cases are cured.

00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.795
If you have been to horrible gurus, you get cured.

00:18:24.006 --> 00:18:27.743
All these things happen. But that's not the end of it.

00:18:27.943 --> 00:18:30.518
This is just the redeeming part of it.

00:18:30.718 --> 00:18:33.775
The redeeming part is that you are redeemed

00:18:33.975 --> 00:18:38.154
of all these physical, mental, emotional problems.

00:18:38.354 --> 00:18:43.263
But another part of it is

00:18:43.467 --> 00:18:48.042
that you yourself get the power.

00:18:48.242 --> 00:18:50.024
You become the prophets.

00:18:50.224 --> 00:18:52.382
"The men of God will become prophets."

00:18:52.582 --> 00:18:56.603
That's what your great poet William Blake has said.

00:18:56.803 --> 00:19:01.669
"The men of God will become prophets, and they will have power

00:19:01.869 --> 00:19:05.324
to make others prophet." This is the sign.

00:19:05.524 --> 00:19:07.572
He has given you the sign.

00:19:07.772 --> 00:19:10.561
You become prophets.

00:19:10.761 --> 00:19:14.318
That means you get the power to do all this yourself.

00:19:14.518 --> 00:19:16.613
Every individual can do it.

00:19:16.813 --> 00:19:19.665
Even small children can do it.

00:19:19.865 --> 00:19:22.530
Even a little Olympia can do it.

00:19:25.277 --> 00:19:31.688
When you become the prophet you also know everything about it:

00:19:31.967 --> 00:19:37.407
What you are doing, how you have to do it,

00:19:38.102 --> 00:19:40.480
how to raise the Kundalini,

00:19:40.680 --> 00:19:45.544
how to cross all the different centers which are sick,

00:19:45.744 --> 00:19:47.589
how to keep it there.

00:19:47.789 --> 00:19:51.308
You become absolutely the master.

00:19:51.508 --> 00:19:53.571
Now the prophets were... We can say...

00:19:53.771 --> 00:19:56.040
Like William Blake was a prophet. All right.

00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:59.040
He was a seer. He saw this future.

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.080
He's mentioned everything that was going to happen to Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:04.358
No doubt.

00:20:04.558 --> 00:20:06.605
I don't know how many are aware of it.

00:20:06.805 --> 00:20:10.830
Most or them thought he was a lunatic. They couldn't believe him.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:15.070
When he talked of all these things, that Jerusalem

00:20:16.398 --> 00:20:23.208
is going to be established in England's pasture land.

00:20:23.574 --> 00:20:27.526
Nobody could believe. They said, "Must be mad."

00:20:28.452 --> 00:20:35.776
But the time has come. Jerusalem is to be established.

00:20:35.976 --> 00:20:39.240
There's a special thing about England.

00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:46.040
And he saw that hundred years back, clearly the whole picture.

00:20:48.124 --> 00:20:51.016
But nobody understood him. He was a prophet.

00:20:51.216 --> 00:20:54.736
Nobody understood him what he said.

00:20:57.163 --> 00:21:01.037
Those who understood also had an academic sort of an interest in him.

00:21:01.237 --> 00:21:03.685
And some people did feel there may be

00:21:03.885 --> 00:21:07.645
some sort of a truth in what he has said and described.

00:21:09.805 --> 00:21:14.325
So you are more than a prophet in a way

00:21:14.525 --> 00:21:17.245
that you are not interested in seeing the future,

00:21:17.480 --> 00:21:20.364
but you come in the present.

00:21:20.564 --> 00:21:24.880
What they described, the future for them, which they did not enjoy,

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:27.421
is your present.

00:21:27.621 --> 00:21:31.861
And that you become the master yourself.

00:21:33.075 --> 00:21:36.515
All these great prophets had a big, big problem.

00:21:36.715 --> 00:21:39.284
I had a discussion with an ambassador recently

00:21:39.509 --> 00:21:42.371
who is a very learned man from India.

00:21:42.571 --> 00:21:45.900
And he was telling Me that the biggest problem was

00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:52.484
that with rationality, with explanations, how far can we go?

00:21:52.684 --> 00:21:55.413
Supposing you say there is a all-pervading power.

00:21:55.613 --> 00:21:58.129
They say, "How, how, how are we to believe it?

00:21:58.329 --> 00:22:00.854
It's all cock and bull story.

00:22:01.054 --> 00:22:02.946
Prove it to us."

00:22:03.146 --> 00:22:05.346
By argument of course you cannot prove it,

00:22:05.546 --> 00:22:08.819
but for experiencing also you cannot prove it.

00:22:09.046 --> 00:22:10.320
So they used to give up.

00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:13.415
Like Adi Shankaracharya at the point he reached.

00:22:13.644 --> 00:22:17.122
He wrote about the Viveka Chudamani and all these treatises,

00:22:17.322 --> 00:22:20.369
and then he gave up. And he started describing the Mother.

00:22:20.569 --> 00:22:22.828
He said, "I give up. That's all."

00:22:23.028 --> 00:22:25.755
And they said that he went soft in his head.

00:22:25.955 --> 00:22:28.240
Because he couldn't go ahead with his philosophy

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.059
and started praising the Mother.

00:22:30.259 --> 00:22:32.341
Said, "What's wrong?"

00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:36.501
The same thing happens with Bible, with Koran, with everything

00:22:36.748 --> 00:22:41.664
that people think either you follow them with faith, with blind faith.

00:22:41.864 --> 00:22:46.862
"Do not question anything." "Just accept whatever they are saying."

00:22:47.062 --> 00:22:49.942
Become fanatics, kill each other, die.

00:22:50.994 --> 00:22:53.202
Then it's all right.

00:22:53.402 --> 00:22:56.822
Or else you just give up. You become communists.

00:22:57.022 --> 00:22:58.757
"No God."

00:23:00.366 --> 00:23:02.484
If you have to have your brains alive

00:23:02.684 --> 00:23:04.135
then you better give up all these religions.

00:23:04.335 --> 00:23:05.440
We should say, "All nonsense."

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.450
Christianity is hopeless because these churches.

00:23:08.905 --> 00:23:11.360
Islam is useless because of fanaticism.

00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:14.051
That is useless because of this and that is...

00:23:14.251 --> 00:23:18.145
Hinduism is another nonsense.

00:23:18.345 --> 00:23:21.717
Because at this level, it looks like that.

00:23:21.917 --> 00:23:24.783
At this point it appears like that.

00:23:24.983 --> 00:23:27.732
It has no meaning, it's nonsensical.

00:23:27.932 --> 00:23:30.885
This blind faith people can't accept.

00:23:31.085 --> 00:23:32.820
The scientists say, "What is this blind faith?

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:36.290
We went to moon. It's all just the same. What's there?

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:38.180
We went to moon. We never saw God.

00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:40.129
What are you talking about God?

00:23:40.329 --> 00:23:42.829
How are we to believe there is God?

00:23:43.501 --> 00:23:48.101
But we have to now prove the existence of God.

00:23:49.744 --> 00:23:54.560
We have to prove the existence of this All-Pervading Power.

00:23:54.765 --> 00:23:59.393
We have to prove the existence of that spirit within you.

00:23:59.593 --> 00:24:03.332
It is to be proved. It is to be actualized.

00:24:03.590 --> 00:24:05.528
So arguments will stop.

00:24:05.728 --> 00:24:09.863
With arguments one cannot achieve it.

00:24:10.078 --> 00:24:14.117
With blind faith one cannot achieve it.

00:24:14.912 --> 00:24:17.440
Rationality cannot take it there.

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:21.393
Or this emotional adherence will not take you there.

00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:24.242
It's actualization,

00:24:24.808 --> 00:24:29.941
is the happening that really makes you that.

00:24:33.323 --> 00:24:36.222
The reality that is

00:24:36.422 --> 00:24:41.932
actually expressing within your central nervous system.

00:24:42.132 --> 00:24:45.481
That is the one is going to convince.

00:24:45.691 --> 00:24:47.120
But it is not for conviction.

00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:51.242
For example if you are not convinced, the Divine is not interested.

00:24:51.442 --> 00:24:54.603
Like these people were saying, "Mother, by putting up posters

00:24:54.803 --> 00:24:56.925
that these people know about You, that You are there."

00:24:57.125 --> 00:24:59.701
I said, "That's all. That's all."

00:25:00.173 --> 00:25:03.001
We have told them, we have passed the message.

00:25:03.213 --> 00:25:08.973
Now, if they come, well and good. That's our job, is to inform.

00:25:09.549 --> 00:25:13.669
If they come, if they get realization, well and good"

00:25:13.909 --> 00:25:17.718
If they establish themselves, even better" We'll work hard for that.

00:25:17.918 --> 00:25:21.540
But we cannot force it. We cannot force it.

00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:25.936
We cannot have any artificial ways of impressing you.

00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:30.000
Like we cannot carry a circus about.

00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:34.518
You have to have a sensitivity of your own to understand the importance.

00:25:34.718 --> 00:25:38.922
And your own pure intelligence must tell you that this is the thing.

00:25:39.122 --> 00:25:42.812
Otherwise we cannot fall at your feet and say, "Oh, please..."

00:25:43.012 --> 00:25:44.834
We cannot implore.

00:25:45.034 --> 00:25:48.788
Neither can we cross your freedom that is given to you.

00:25:48.988 --> 00:25:56.534
It's in your own freedom, and in it's own glory that you have to ascend.

00:25:56.734 --> 00:25:59.996
Because you are epitome,

00:26:00.352 --> 00:26:04.996
you are the epitome of this creation.

00:26:05.671 --> 00:26:07.979
Nobody can force you to.

00:26:08.179 --> 00:26:10.133
If you want to go to hell. All right.

00:26:10.333 --> 00:26:13.354
Take two running jumps and you can go down.

00:26:13.554 --> 00:26:18.435
If you want to go to heaven, that's also possible.

00:26:20.369 --> 00:26:23.570
So the time we are here"

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:27.690
We do not realize how precarious they are, how vital,

00:26:27.890 --> 00:26:33.810
and the most important times for which we have been waiting.

00:26:34.868 --> 00:26:38.881
The most important moment

00:26:39.145 --> 00:26:46.286
in the life of creation is today.

00:26:46.805 --> 00:26:50.876
When people are seeking

00:26:51.905 --> 00:26:57.933
and Sahaja Yoga is manifested on a mass scale.

00:26:59.252 --> 00:27:05.892
This is such a fortunate thing that you are seekers of ages,

00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.920
gathered here,

00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:15.388
and that Sahaja Yoga has come to you as a blessing of the Divine.

00:27:15.588 --> 00:27:19.298
Because Divine Itself is anxious to manifest (within you).

00:27:19.832 --> 00:27:25.933
But people who come to Me are of different levels.

00:27:26.133 --> 00:27:30.321
Some are mediocres, some are absolutely base.

00:27:30.521 --> 00:27:32.404
Those who are absolutely base will say:

00:27:32.604 --> 00:27:35.480
"Mother, what about my job? I have applied for it."

00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:38.778
You maybe something little better."

00:27:38.978 --> 00:27:42.480
Or some people can say, "Mother, I am not so well, this, that."

00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:46.282
All right, that also can be done.

00:27:48.588 --> 00:27:54.840
But those who are of a very high quality,

00:27:55.040 --> 00:27:56.800
- whatever may be their problems,

00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.920
whatever they have done so called sins -,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.532
is all forgiven completely within.

00:28:04.490 --> 00:28:05.720
Not to feel guilty at all.

00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:07.933
In Sahaja Yoga the first mantra one has to say,

00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:11.134
"Mother I am not guilty", three times, at least.

00:28:11.334 --> 00:28:16.011
So one has to understand that you are ready for it.

00:28:16.211 --> 00:28:19.497
You are glorified for it, and you have to get it.

00:28:19.697 --> 00:28:21.857
You don't have to say,

00:28:22.057 --> 00:28:28.875
"What have I done? I have had so many mistakes on my account."

00:28:29.075 --> 00:28:31.635
Nothing of the kind.

00:28:31.985 --> 00:28:33.798
I am here like a banker.

00:28:33.998 --> 00:28:38.265
I have to cash your checks, and you will get it, no doubt.

00:28:38.465 --> 00:28:42.465
You don't know how much money you have in the bank, do you?

00:28:43.475 --> 00:28:47.360
I know it. So you don't judge yourself. You leave it to Me to judge.

00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.814
It's My judgment.

00:28:51.637 --> 00:28:54.292
And then when it happens,

00:28:54.492 --> 00:28:56.507
if you have pure intelligence you will understand

00:28:56.707 --> 00:28:58.880
this is what it is.

00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.289
And you have to settle down with it.

00:29:01.489 --> 00:29:04.466
Of course you can't pay for it. I mean it's all absurd ideas:

00:29:04.666 --> 00:29:07.630
"We can pay for it. How long we have to say it?

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:09.131
There should be an organization."

00:29:09.331 --> 00:29:11.214
We have no organization. You know it very well.

00:29:11.414 --> 00:29:15.045
We cannot organize God. We cannot organize these things.

00:29:16.174 --> 00:29:20.935
We don't even have membership, nothing of the kind.

00:29:21.135 --> 00:29:23.053
Of course we keep your list.

00:29:23.253 --> 00:29:26.600
Because if we have any programs, we inform you.

00:29:26.800 --> 00:29:28.516
That's a different thing.

00:29:28.716 --> 00:29:31.308
Moreover in Sahaja Yoga

00:29:31.508 --> 00:29:36.793
everybody is not exposed to the complete thing, is not exposed.

00:29:36.993 --> 00:29:41.052
First they are given realization.

00:29:41.252 --> 00:29:44.734
Then they are weighed how far they are.

00:29:45.019 --> 00:29:50.269
Then gradually when they grow up, they receive higher truths.

00:29:50.469 --> 00:29:52.532
Because sometimes they can be shocked.

00:29:52.732 --> 00:29:56.672
It's not easy to bear the truth. Sometimes it's very difficult.

00:29:56.872 --> 00:30:00.973
Like I told them once

00:30:01.550 --> 00:30:06.006
that there is no difference

00:30:06.206 --> 00:30:11.472
between what Christ has taught and what Krishna has said.

00:30:11.672 --> 00:30:18.520
On the contrary, Krishna said that you cannot be destroyed.

00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:22.040
The Spirit cannot be destroyed by anything.

00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:24.660
And that was proved by Christ.

00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:29.643
And all the Hindus were about to kill Me. They couldn't bear it.

00:30:29.956 --> 00:30:32.275
But if I say something about Krishna,

00:30:32.475 --> 00:30:36.589
all the Christians will be there to criticize Me.

00:30:36.789 --> 00:30:39.511
So, it's a big problem.

00:30:39.711 --> 00:30:44.160
You see if you talk to them about Krishna, the Christians don't like it.

00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:49.131
If you talk about Christ, the Hindus don't like it.

00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:55.280
If you talk about Sikhism, the Islam, Muslims do not like it.

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.417
And if you talk about Mohammed Saab, the Sikhs don't like it.

00:31:00.617 --> 00:31:03.066
I am not here to please anyone.

00:31:03.266 --> 00:31:05.578
I am here to tell you the truth about them.

00:31:05.778 --> 00:31:07.376
That they are all one.

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:11.120
And like fools and stupid people we are fighting each other.

00:31:12.036 --> 00:31:17.877
There is no difference between them. They are all one. Absolutely one.

00:31:18.077 --> 00:31:22.408
Such a concord and such an understanding exists between them

00:31:22.608 --> 00:31:24.420
that you cannot separate them.

00:31:24.620 --> 00:31:28.000
They are so one with each other as the moonlight is with moon

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:30.102
or sunlight is with sun.

00:31:30.302 --> 00:31:36.788
It's only our ignorance makes that kind of allegation against them.

00:31:36.988 --> 00:31:40.283
And this you will realize in Sahaja Yoga itself.

00:31:40.483 --> 00:31:45.161
It will be proved by the ascendance of your awareness.

00:31:45.476 --> 00:31:47.539
Through your Kundalini it will be proved

00:31:47.739 --> 00:31:50.832
that whatever I am saying will be proved scientifically.

00:31:51.122 --> 00:31:54.703
Because the Kundalini, when She rises and It stops,

00:31:54.903 --> 00:31:59.040
you have to get over your mythical ideas.

00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.435
Otherwise It won't rise.

00:32:00.635 --> 00:32:05.513
You, yourself, will learn gradually that what I am saying is the truth.

00:32:05.713 --> 00:32:09.389
Whatever I am saying about Mohammed Saab is the truth.

00:32:09.589 --> 00:32:11.877
And you will learn it.

00:32:12.385 --> 00:32:16.284
We have had enough of fights. We have had enough of nonsense.

00:32:16.484 --> 00:32:19.244
See now what's happening is these

00:32:19.858 --> 00:32:23.607
Israelis are killing the PLO's and all this.

00:32:23.807 --> 00:32:28.635
Do you think by killing them they are going to achieve God?

00:32:32.524 --> 00:32:37.844
These false ideas all have to go.

00:32:39.289 --> 00:32:43.928
We have to become universal beings - become. You become that.

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:47.720
Whether somebody's a Muslim, or a Hindu, or Christian, or anything.

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:49.380
When you become a universal being,

00:32:49.580 --> 00:32:52.616
you can feel the person where he is on your fingers.

00:32:52.816 --> 00:32:56.550
Christ has said, "Your hands will speak.

00:32:57.429 --> 00:33:00.167
Your hands will speak."

00:33:02.012 --> 00:33:05.400
We don't have to challenge any scriptures.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:11.032
We have to see the inner light in all what is described.

00:33:11.348 --> 00:33:16.840
Which is making us separated, is actually the uniting factor.

00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.225
The diversity has such a beautiful unity within us.

00:33:20.425 --> 00:33:23.520
But that only can be seen by the raising of the Kundalini.

00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:25.066
There's no way out.

00:33:25.266 --> 00:33:28.759
Because when the Kundalini rises, the integration takes place.

00:33:28.990 --> 00:33:33.510
And you start seeing it as an actual experience.

00:33:36.852 --> 00:33:41.280
I hope you have understood what I have said.

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:45.919
But arguments are not going to give you Realization. It has to happen.

00:33:46.748 --> 00:33:50.200
It doesn't matter, you may be the crown prince,

00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:54.175
or you may be the king, or you may be anything.

00:33:55.084 --> 00:33:56.881
Makes no difference.

00:33:57.081 --> 00:34:00.012
It's your individual happening that has to take place.

00:34:00.212 --> 00:34:03.029
This is your individual Mother within you.

00:34:03.229 --> 00:34:06.123
This is the Ruh I'm talking about.

00:34:07.283 --> 00:34:11.042
Just by ritualism you cannot achieve God.

00:34:11.242 --> 00:34:13.766
You have to be connected with God.

00:34:13.966 --> 00:34:17.961
For all the people of the world who understand and who think

00:34:18.161 --> 00:34:20.226
it is important

00:34:20.426 --> 00:34:26.840
to know that there must be a truth which we can actualize.

00:34:27.040 --> 00:34:31.315
It is been promised in all the religions and scriptures.

00:34:32.214 --> 00:34:33.889
And it has to happen.

00:34:34.089 --> 00:34:37.169
May God bless you all.

00:34:38.031 --> 00:34:40.561
I would like to have some questions from you.

00:34:40.761 --> 00:34:44.217
If possible, I'll try to answer them.

00:34:44.417 --> 00:34:48.857
Please ask Me some questions, would be a good idea.

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:51.397
Again, I say I'm sorry for coming late

00:34:51.597 --> 00:34:57.101
but you understand the way we're jammed. The traffic...

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.215
Yes, please.

00:35:04.415 --> 00:35:08.699
(inaudible) difference there Your Yoga with Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga?

00:35:08.899 --> 00:35:12.659
Oh! I'll tell you about that.

00:35:20.886 --> 00:35:26.886
It's a very good question. It's about Hatha Yoga and Raja Yoga.

00:35:27.292 --> 00:35:32.212
Now the modern Hatha Yoga is something I just don't understand.

00:35:32.526 --> 00:35:36.850
But Patanjali Shastra, the one who has written "Ha" "Tha".

00:35:37.086 --> 00:35:40.280
That is "Ha" and "Tha" is nothing but you have these two Nadis

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:43.318
which these must have described to you.

00:35:43.756 --> 00:35:49.952
And there are Ashtangas. Means there are eight aspects of Hatha Yoga

00:35:50.152 --> 00:35:53.227
according to Patanjali who has written it.

00:35:53.427 --> 00:35:56.913
The most important, and the primordial, and the first one

00:35:57.113 --> 00:36:00.063
is "Ishwara Prahnidhana",

00:36:00.263 --> 00:36:03.801
means the establishment of God within you.

00:36:04.001 --> 00:36:08.530
Now in these acrobatic things that we do. We have no idea of God.

00:36:08.792 --> 00:36:11.784
We never talk of it. Forget, forget about God,

00:36:12.011 --> 00:36:14.358
Only you have to thin down. That's all.

00:36:15.059 --> 00:36:17.893
Because they all want to be actors and actresses, you see.

00:36:18.093 --> 00:36:20.660
They don't want to be yogis.

00:36:20.860 --> 00:36:24.163
It's a different style of things.

00:36:25.226 --> 00:36:29.826
It was "Ishwhara Prahnidhana" - first you must get your Realization.

00:36:30.117 --> 00:36:35.143
Out of these eight one is Yama Niyama.

00:36:35.427 --> 00:36:38.892
In the Niyama there is only one for physical exercises

00:36:39.092 --> 00:36:42.558
that too depending on where the Kundalini is.

00:36:42.758 --> 00:36:44.716
We also use Hatha Yoga in a way.

00:36:44.916 --> 00:36:48.099
Supposing Kundalini is stopping at a point at a certain center.

00:36:48.299 --> 00:36:52.514
due to physical problem, we do a little Asanas

00:36:52.714 --> 00:36:57.364
which are necessary - or some exercise - to do it.

00:36:58.626 --> 00:37:01.080
But that's a very different thing.

00:37:01.280 --> 00:37:03.743
Our modern Hatha Yoga is like this:

00:37:03.943 --> 00:37:08.723
that supposing I have to come from London to Birmingham, all right.

00:37:09.305 --> 00:37:14.739
I don't start My car, nothing. But I turn it to the left and the right,

00:37:14.939 --> 00:37:17.522
standing there, static, you see.

00:37:17.722 --> 00:37:20.491
And I think I have reached Birmingham.

00:37:20.691 --> 00:37:24.246
Only I have the map, I'll go right, left...

00:37:24.858 --> 00:37:27.218
Or even worse than that - I would give an analogy:

00:37:27.436 --> 00:37:30.184
 It is like taking all the medicines together

00:37:30.384 --> 00:37:33.572
without knowing what disease you have got.

00:37:33.772 --> 00:37:37.332
It's very indiscriminate.

00:37:38.112 --> 00:37:40.471
None of these teachers have Realization

00:37:40.671 --> 00:37:43.814
How will they understand the importance of Hatha Yoga? I don't understand.

00:37:44.031 --> 00:37:48.051
In India a Guru is the person who is a realized soul.

00:37:48.251 --> 00:37:51.141
He could be a Muslim, he could be a Hindu, he could be anyone.

00:37:51.402 --> 00:37:54.577
But he has to be a realized soul to begin with.

00:37:54.777 --> 00:37:57.417
Brahmin is a realized soul.

00:37:57.681 --> 00:38:01.873
Nowadays, these days the Brahmins can be kept as cooks.

00:38:03.982 --> 00:38:09.052
So the whole concept is so superficial today's Hatha Yoga.

00:38:09.315 --> 00:38:11.970
Then Raja Yoga is...

00:38:12.170 --> 00:38:17.650
Now - so you understand Hatha Yoga is a thing...

00:38:18.337 --> 00:38:21.249
The beginning of Hatha Yoga starts with Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:21.449 --> 00:38:22.810
when it is established.

00:38:23.079 --> 00:38:25.298
But Hatha Yoga is a subsidiary thing.

00:38:25.498 --> 00:38:27.730
Wherever we need, we can use it.

00:38:27.930 --> 00:38:32.358
Wherever we need the part of it, we use it.

00:38:32.558 --> 00:38:34.867
The second part is the Raja Yoga.

00:38:35.067 --> 00:38:37.991
Raja Yoga is another misconception people have got.

00:38:38.191 --> 00:38:40.400
That when the Kundalini rises you see.

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.114
You must see this is a tremendous happening that takes place.

00:38:43.314 --> 00:38:46.530
Is the Kundalini rising from that upwards.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:50.079
It's not towards the gravity. It's moving upwards.

00:38:50.279 --> 00:38:53.853
So to happen this, there must be some happenings taking place.

00:38:54.068 --> 00:38:57.101
For example when it rises, from here you see,

00:38:57.356 --> 00:38:59.340
when it crosses the second center,

00:38:59.540 --> 00:39:04.445
it goes into a kind of a augmentation there.

00:39:04.645 --> 00:39:06.944
So the Kundalini doesn't fall off.

00:39:07.144 --> 00:39:08.956
That is called as Bhandas.

00:39:09.156 --> 00:39:13.160
These Bhandas, you see the augmentation we can say, the closing of it.

00:39:13.360 --> 00:39:16.958
Then it goes higher, it starts closing these.

00:39:17.358 --> 00:39:22.087
It comes through the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:39:22.404 --> 00:39:26.699
There all energy has to be brought into play.

00:39:26.899 --> 00:39:30.116
So there's a cachery happens that the tongue little bit put here.

00:39:30.316 --> 00:39:32.520
But you won't feel anything. It's so fast.

00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.980
It's so quick you won't feel it.

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:38.184
I mean I cannot give another analogy like that,

00:39:38.393 --> 00:39:41.840
that even if you say "Concorde", I mean you do feel something about it.

00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:45.280
But supposing if you have a plane that you just board in

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:47.250
and you are there.

00:39:47.450 --> 00:39:50.921
In a split of a second the Kundalini She can just shoot off.

00:39:51.121 --> 00:39:53.339
So you don't feel any of these things.

00:39:53.547 --> 00:39:58.430
Like the whole earth is so big, but you don't see that it's round.

00:39:58.630 --> 00:40:02.427
The circumference in relation to thing that you see is so small

00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:04.433
that you don't see it's round.

00:40:04.633 --> 00:40:10.153
In the same way Sahaja Yoga is such a quick method

00:40:10.760 --> 00:40:12.160
of Kundalini rising.

00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:13.840
I mean there's no other method.

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.782
But today's Sahaja Yoga I should say - is so fast -

00:40:16.982 --> 00:40:19.606
that you don't feel anything, but happens.

00:40:19.806 --> 00:40:22.072
Your eyes also get dilated.

00:40:22.272 --> 00:40:25.353
But I have seen these mad people called Raja Yogis.

00:40:25.553 --> 00:40:28.483
They even put atropine in their eyes to dilate their pupil.

00:40:28.683 --> 00:40:30.760
Because is said your eyes must be dilated.

00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:33.320
They cut out their tongue, push it back.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:35.960
You see there was one in America

00:40:36.160 --> 00:40:38.171
used to cut out the tongue of the people,

00:40:38.371 --> 00:40:39.560
used to wag their tongues.

00:40:39.760 --> 00:40:42.840
Even there are now today people affected by this great guru

00:40:43.051 --> 00:40:45.051
whose tongues are still wagging like this.

00:40:45.267 --> 00:40:47.399
And they used to put back their tongues.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:49.559
Do you mean to say by doing all these tricks

00:40:49.759 --> 00:40:52.639
you are going to raise the Kundalini?

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:54.516
Some hold their thing.

00:40:54.716 --> 00:40:57.144
There's nothing to be done.

00:40:57.344 --> 00:40:58.760
 It is spontaneous.

00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:02.078
It is effortless.

00:41:02.278 --> 00:41:05.830
It is in the loving care of God.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:09.946
Why do you want to break your necks for nothing at all?

00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.806
What is the need?

00:41:13.006 --> 00:41:16.006
I first used to think "like children", you see.

00:41:16.224 --> 00:41:18.884
When they want to impress their mother for something,

00:41:19.084 --> 00:41:21.032
they do these tantrums, you see.

00:41:21.338 --> 00:41:23.298
Just to attract the attention to mother.

00:41:23.524 --> 00:41:25.884
But now I think they are very serious about it.

00:41:26.135 --> 00:41:29.896
It's most surprising. Your going to that extent, you see.

00:41:30.187 --> 00:41:32.947
It spoils your chakras.

00:41:33.236 --> 00:41:35.931
It spoils your

00:41:38.542 --> 00:41:42.530
position in Sahaja Yoga

00:41:43.194 --> 00:41:47.071
as a good Sahaja Yogi and a bad Sahaja Yogi.

00:41:47.271 --> 00:41:49.419
A Sahaja Yogi who gets it quick,

00:41:49.619 --> 00:41:54.290
stationed himself there, and master it, is a person who goes very fast.

00:41:54.490 --> 00:41:59.549
And a person who has ruined his chakras requires attention.

00:41:59.763 --> 00:42:03.328
One has to take a lot of trouble to improve them,

00:42:03.528 --> 00:42:06.172
to care for them.

00:42:08.494 --> 00:42:14.353
So all these ideas can be only clarified when you get your Realization.

00:42:16.917 --> 00:42:19.523
All right? May God bless you.

00:42:19.723 --> 00:42:23.074
Can Bhagavad Gita and the eight astangas help?

00:42:23.274 --> 00:42:25.954
What is it? Bhagvad Gita hai?

00:42:26.194 --> 00:42:28.874
Can Patanjali help?

00:42:29.130 --> 00:42:32.680
Eight...? No. Because unless and until you are realized.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.960
I am saying, supposing now it is like this:

00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.921
before starting your car, if you move it right and left,

00:42:39.473 --> 00:42:40.960
and then start the car.

00:42:41.160 --> 00:42:44.122
Will it help to come to Birmingham? It is wasteful.

00:42:44.322 --> 00:42:48.021
First of all it might have already broken your wheels.

00:42:51.061 --> 00:42:56.198
Oh. But nothing to worry. I mean, I must say nothing to worry about.

00:42:56.602 --> 00:42:58.642
All right?

00:42:59.138 --> 00:43:01.938
May God bless you. May God bless you.

00:43:02.579 --> 00:43:06.019
See, I don't blame anyone, or don't feel bad.

00:43:06.259 --> 00:43:08.059
Because after all you are seekers, you know.

00:43:08.286 --> 00:43:10.885
You are seekers. How are you to know?

00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:13.244
You are all seekers. How are you to know?

00:43:13.444 --> 00:43:14.595
These people write so many books.

00:43:14.795 --> 00:43:17.560
Is easy to write any book, isn't it, these days, what is there?

00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:19.320
If you have money you can write anything.

00:43:19.520 --> 00:43:23.000
You can publish anything. Whatever you want to write.

00:43:23.244 --> 00:43:26.004
What does it take to write?

00:43:26.499 --> 00:43:29.699
Only I am the person who has not written anything so far.

00:43:30.436 --> 00:43:33.167
There are people writing about Me or about Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:33.367 --> 00:43:34.320
is different from.

00:43:34.520 --> 00:43:36.742
I have not written anything so far.

00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.000
Christ has not written anything.

00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:42.960
Shri Krishna never wrote anything. Rama never wrote anything.

00:43:43.657 --> 00:43:45.978
But I'll have to write, I think.

00:43:46.178 --> 00:43:47.734
I wrote something and people said,

00:43:47.934 --> 00:43:49.480
"It goes over our head, Mother.

00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:51.905
Because as soon as we read it we become thoughtless."

00:43:52.105 --> 00:43:54.025
Now what to do?

00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.220
All right. What's the next question please? Very good question.

00:44:04.529 --> 00:44:09.689
What's the next question? Five minutes more.

00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:17.520
Yes?

00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:21.966
Could we ask a question to God when we get connected within?

00:44:22.486 --> 00:44:23.189
Could we?

00:44:23.389 --> 00:44:26.000
Can you ask a questions of God when you get connected?

00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.301
Yes.

00:44:27.501 --> 00:44:29.880
Can we ask questions to God when we are connected...?

00:44:30.080 --> 00:44:31.000
Yes. Of course! Of course!

00:44:31.200 --> 00:44:37.195
Now I see. Because you are connected. So you put your hands towards God

00:44:37.395 --> 00:44:40.629
and say, "Is there God?"

00:44:40.884 --> 00:44:44.684
If you ask such a question, tremendous vibrations will flow.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:49.012
You... Not only that.

00:44:49.259 --> 00:44:52.987
But you want to ask, say, about your own father.

00:44:53.187 --> 00:44:54.207
How is he?

00:44:54.407 --> 00:44:56.880
Supposing he is not here.

00:44:57.660 --> 00:45:00.278
You'll get a burning somewhere here.

00:45:00.567 --> 00:45:02.127
These are his centers.

00:45:02.327 --> 00:45:04.596
Immediately, you will know which center is catching.

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:06.320
And if you know the decoding,

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.126
immediately you will know what the problem he has got.

00:45:09.835 --> 00:45:12.070
You will know about everyone like that,

00:45:12.306 --> 00:45:15.486
not only about God, about yourself, and about others.

00:45:15.686 --> 00:45:19.276
That is what it is - the becoming of the collective consciousness.

00:45:19.476 --> 00:45:22.986
That you become a universal being.

00:45:23.186 --> 00:45:27.226
And will we be able to see the God as I'm able to see you?

00:45:28.477 --> 00:45:31.619
It's not seeing the God. It's not the point today.

00:45:31.819 --> 00:45:34.882
Because seeing is in any case is not being.

00:45:35.082 --> 00:45:36.180
You see My difference?

00:45:36.380 --> 00:45:38.916
Now you are. What's your name please?

00:45:39.135 --> 00:45:39.760
Bippin.

00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:43.859
Bippin. Now you are Mr. Bippin. Can you see yourself, Mr. Bippin?

00:45:44.059 --> 00:45:46.600
Now when you have become Mr. Bippin, you can't see.

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:50.161
When you become part and parcel of God you can't see anything.

00:45:50.825 --> 00:45:53.265
But you can act.

00:45:54.653 --> 00:45:57.853
Seeing is being separated.

00:45:59.424 --> 00:46:01.663
So you're really saying become one with the God?

00:46:01.863 --> 00:46:04.146
Yes, that's the point.

00:46:04.346 --> 00:46:07.426
You become one with the God, with the Primordial Being.

00:46:07.626 --> 00:46:13.040
You become, we become His power, or you become His instruments.

00:46:13.240 --> 00:46:15.026
You see. One should not go into dogmas.

00:46:15.226 --> 00:46:18.290
Because you see on that there might be a quarrel already existing

00:46:18.545 --> 00:46:21.581
whether you become His instrument, or He becomes your instrument,

00:46:21.781 --> 00:46:22.848
and all that you see.

00:46:23.048 --> 00:46:25.281
So I don't want to fall into that trap.

00:46:25.481 --> 00:46:28.868
But what I would say that you start feeling the power.

00:46:29.075 --> 00:46:31.849
Let's put it down, you become the Spirit.

00:46:32.049 --> 00:46:36.972
That's why, you know, Buddha never talked of God.

00:46:37.172 --> 00:46:39.043
He said, "Better not talk of God.

00:46:39.243 --> 00:46:41.348
Because then other questions will start.

00:46:41.548 --> 00:46:43.462
Better tell them you become your Spirit, finished.

00:46:43.662 --> 00:46:46.662
First let them become Spirit then we'll talk further."

00:46:49.043 --> 00:46:53.283
Any other question please?

00:46:53.628 --> 00:46:58.708
And do you see spirits, you see spirits?

00:46:58.971 --> 00:47:00.840
What is it? Spirits?

00:47:01.111 --> 00:47:02.995
Why do you want to see?

00:47:03.195 --> 00:47:04.035
(...)

00:47:04.235 --> 00:47:06.800
They exist, no doubt, but we have nothing to do with them.

00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:08.480
They are past. They are finished. They are gone.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.040
What are we to bother about them?

00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:12.555
Of course I mean they are there. What to do?

00:47:12.755 --> 00:47:15.195
They are very troublesome people.

00:47:16.361 --> 00:47:19.216
We have had lots of problems from them.

00:47:19.416 --> 00:47:24.388
All these gurus are using them. It's all done. It's there.

00:47:24.588 --> 00:47:26.367
Are there what do you call...

00:47:26.567 --> 00:47:28.088
Good spirits?

00:47:28.288 --> 00:47:28.768
Yes.

00:47:28.986 --> 00:47:30.806
No! No! We should have nothing to do with them.

00:47:31.038 --> 00:47:35.514
Because now you are a person who lives in the present.

00:47:35.714 --> 00:47:38.128
Good or bad we have nothing to do with them.

00:47:38.328 --> 00:47:39.923
How do you know who's good, who's bad?

00:47:40.123 --> 00:47:43.044
Once you allow a good man to come in, a bad man may walk in.

00:47:43.244 --> 00:47:44.692
How will you know?

00:47:44.893 --> 00:47:47.346
So better have none of them coming to you.

00:47:47.546 --> 00:47:50.216
Better be alone about those.

00:47:50.445 --> 00:47:52.478
Gradually you'll know about all of them.

00:47:52.699 --> 00:47:56.325
And you'll be amazed how you know

00:47:56.525 --> 00:48:00.285
to keep away from these people.

00:48:00.656 --> 00:48:02.336
What is Kundalini?

00:48:02.700 --> 00:48:05.560
They didn't tell you what with?  You didn't tell?

00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:08.640
We mentioned, we explained it but you explained it different.

00:48:08.880 --> 00:48:10.040
What see?

00:48:10.240 --> 00:48:11.840
...some sort of energy ...?

00:48:12.040 --> 00:48:13.829
Yes it is. It is energy.

00:48:14.029 --> 00:48:18.779
It is the energy of our desire

00:48:18.994 --> 00:48:20.909
which is not yet manifested.

00:48:21.109 --> 00:48:25.589
And which is that desire which is not yet manifested within us?

00:48:25.874 --> 00:48:30.434
It is the desire to become the Divine.

00:48:31.314 --> 00:48:34.040
Once this energy is manifested -

00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:36.360
that's why it is called as residual -

00:48:36.593 --> 00:48:40.974
then this desire is manifested.

00:48:41.512 --> 00:48:46.758
... create...

00:48:50.471 --> 00:48:52.939
You have to create and imagine this energy?

00:48:53.139 --> 00:48:56.840
No, no, no, no! It exists. It's there.

00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.240
Nothing is imaginary. Nothing is to be done by you.

00:49:00.440 --> 00:49:04.480
It's all there just like a primule in a seed.

00:49:04.681 --> 00:49:06.787
It exists there. You don't have to...

00:49:06.987 --> 00:49:09.538
There's nothing you know, imaginary things, nothing.

00:49:09.738 --> 00:49:12.574
It's really there. You can see the pulsation.

00:49:13.754 --> 00:49:15.920
You can see it pulsating. You can see it rising.

00:49:16.120 --> 00:49:18.440
You can feel the pulsation on top of your head.

00:49:18.680 --> 00:49:20.344
You can see the breaking of this.

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:22.919
You can see the cool breeze coming out of your head,

00:49:23.119 --> 00:49:25.971
the real baptism taking place.

00:49:26.171 --> 00:49:29.564
It's all there. It's all there.

00:49:30.611 --> 00:49:33.630
It's no imagination needed at all.

00:49:33.830 --> 00:49:37.341
It's not thinking. By thinking, you don't do it.

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:42.364
If you think say about a seed, that I imagine now this seed will sprout.

00:49:42.564 --> 00:49:45.274
Will it sprout? No, it has to sprout.

00:49:45.474 --> 00:49:47.977
In the same way it has to happen.

00:49:48.177 --> 00:49:50.692
It's a living process.

00:49:53.194 --> 00:49:57.265
When we realize we have the desire to self realization,

00:49:57.546 --> 00:49:59.162
...

00:49:59.362 --> 00:50:03.430
If we have a quiet place in church will it gradually come to us?

00:50:04.537 --> 00:50:05.454
What is?

00:50:05.654 --> 00:50:09.204
If we have the desire, we don't recognize it,

00:50:09.404 --> 00:50:11.866
will it gradually come to us anyway?

00:50:12.106 --> 00:50:15.406
Yes. Good. But that desire

00:50:15.606 --> 00:50:18.475
is only manifested by Kundalini awakening.

00:50:18.675 --> 00:50:22.626
That desire is there of course. In the Unconscious it is there.

00:50:22.826 --> 00:50:26.160
Gradually it becomes a very conscious desire.

00:50:26.360 --> 00:50:29.003
Then you seek it, you run for it.

00:50:29.256 --> 00:50:31.878
But it is only manifested when the Kundalini rises

00:50:32.078 --> 00:50:34.746
and breaks your fontanel bone area.

00:50:34.946 --> 00:50:36.586
That's it.

00:50:39.176 --> 00:50:43.465
But how does one actually stimulate the Kundalini?

00:50:43.665 --> 00:50:45.446
What stimulates?

00:50:45.646 --> 00:50:48.046
How does one stimulate this energy?

00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:53.680
It just gets stimulated.

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.644
It is there. I think something special about Me.

00:50:58.605 --> 00:51:02.737
And then you become the same special being. You can do it, too.

00:51:02.937 --> 00:51:05.281
It's question as I told you - a light

00:51:05.481 --> 00:51:07.547
enlightens another light all right.

00:51:07.747 --> 00:51:09.362
In the same way.

00:51:15.334 --> 00:51:18.917
...

00:51:35.040 --> 00:51:40.840
You spoke of... He says you spoke of Hatha Yoga is being physical yoga,

00:51:41.040 --> 00:51:42.800
Raja Yoga is being mental yoga.

00:51:43.360 --> 00:51:46.680
Could You talk about the process of this yoga?

00:51:46.985 --> 00:51:49.360
Ah. No, no. I am not saying that is physical.

00:51:49.560 --> 00:51:52.160
We are using it for a physical purpose.

00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:55.680
It is not physical, nor it is mental, this Raja Yoga is.

00:51:55.920 --> 00:51:59.678
All these things are the part and parcel in this Sahaja Yoga

00:51:59.886 --> 00:52:01.941
which is a spontaneous happening.

00:52:02.141 --> 00:52:04.141
In this, this Kundalini

00:52:04.352 --> 00:52:08.328
which is the residual force within us, the desire force within us,

00:52:08.528 --> 00:52:10.756
unwinds itself

00:52:10.956 --> 00:52:14.567
and few threads of this start rising.

00:52:15.044 --> 00:52:18.149
As pulsation you can see it also, the rising.

00:52:18.349 --> 00:52:23.157
She moves up, gradually enlightening these centers.

00:52:23.357 --> 00:52:28.466
And opens up the last center, the seventh center here

00:52:29.749 --> 00:52:33.540
by which the Spirit

00:52:33.740 --> 00:52:38.748
which is actually seated in your heart gets enlightened.

00:52:38.948 --> 00:52:42.841
Because the seat of the Spirit is on top of your head.

00:52:43.041 --> 00:52:44.892
All right?

00:52:54.644 --> 00:52:56.488
No questions?

00:52:57.762 --> 00:53:01.831
All right. So now I think we should have it.

00:53:02.265 --> 00:53:04.050
What do you say?

00:53:04.412 --> 00:53:06.915
Better have it. All right.

00:53:07.115 --> 00:53:09.492
Just put your hands like this...
