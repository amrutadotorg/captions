00:06:21.206 --> 00:06:26.664
This was least expected that we'll have a Puja here or

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:31.236
we'll have any program of this kind.

00:06:31.518 --> 00:06:37.104
But I think something was left out of the whole

00:06:39.057 --> 00:06:43.616
program of such a fast one as you know

00:06:44.013 --> 00:06:48.742
I had to do, going from London to Frankfurt

00:06:48.774 --> 00:06:52.251
to America to Bogota, to be back, then Andorra

00:06:52.276 --> 00:06:56.603
and all these places still, I thought, now
it is finished.

00:06:56.628 --> 00:07:00.184
And I came here in London I learned that

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.097
there was one Puja was not done it is left Vishuddhi,

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.838
and that coincides with this Raksha Bandhan

00:07:11.863 --> 00:07:16.029
because it is the sister relationship and brother relationship.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:27.156
So in the history, if you go, Shri Krishna was born

00:07:27.204 --> 00:07:29.863
the day his sister was born,

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:40.394
and this Vishnumaya was transferred from, transformed

00:07:40.689 --> 00:07:44.815
I should say, into a lightning later on,

00:07:45.101 --> 00:07:48.976
but She was the one who announced

00:07:49.524 --> 00:07:55.456
the existence of Shri Krishna at that time -

00:07:55.481 --> 00:07:59.770
that He is born and He is living, He is in the present.

00:08:00.463 --> 00:08:04.582
This is the job of the left Vishuddhi, of the lightning,

00:08:04.885 --> 00:08:10.292
and you have seen that whenever
I am going to any place, or

00:08:10.317 --> 00:08:14.060
I will be giving a program or something, just before that,

00:08:14.139 --> 00:08:18.731
the lightning, the thunder, all this appears in the sky, you see,

00:08:18.906 --> 00:08:22.055
to show that announcement.

00:08:22.323 --> 00:08:26.826
So it is one of the things that is used for
announcement.

00:08:27.129 --> 00:08:33.185
To make it more practical and understanding is

00:08:33.225 --> 00:08:38.760
that we use electricity now for our televisions,

00:08:39.014 --> 00:08:43.426
for our announcements, for telling people about messages

00:08:44.037 --> 00:08:45.943
of something of great importance.

00:08:45.968 --> 00:08:49.142
I don't know if they do it, might not be.

00:08:49.708 --> 00:08:54.416
In the same way we should use our left Vishuddhi
for the announcement

00:08:54.607 --> 00:08:57.042
of the coming of Adi Shakti.

00:08:57.265 --> 00:09:01.734
But on the contrary, people start using it as a pocket

00:09:02.193 --> 00:09:06.232
kept for our extra ego to be filled.

00:09:07.681 --> 00:09:12.951
When we feel guilty, firstly we feel guilty when

00:09:13.047 --> 00:09:17.327
our sense of relationships are not all right.

00:09:18.707 --> 00:09:25.819
For example, we do not understand a sister

00:09:27.488 --> 00:09:32.599
and a brother, the relationship, which is very pure,

00:09:32.964 --> 00:09:38.242
and is above all kinds of contamination.

00:09:41.518 --> 00:09:45.177
But as you know in the West,

00:09:45.209 --> 00:09:51.180
because maybe of drinking and doing all kinds of things

00:09:51.205 --> 00:09:55.257
which are against awareness, people have lost the value system,

00:09:55.337 --> 00:09:57.803
and in that they have also lost

00:09:57.828 --> 00:10:01.886
the system to understand what is a sister
and what is a brother.

00:10:04.353 --> 00:10:08.994
So Vishnumaya is so important - extremely important -

00:10:09.216 --> 00:10:19.404
because of Her, announcement of an incarnation takes place.

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.898
It's, you can say, in the cosmos that is the
television that announces.

00:10:26.715 --> 00:10:28.602
It works it out.

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:34.227
But in our own being Vishnumaya it resides in the left Vishuddhi,

00:10:35.083 --> 00:10:41.057
and I find that Vishnumaya is the thing that suffers
the most, especially in the West,

00:10:41.082 --> 00:10:44.408
because it's a fashion to feel guilty about everything.

00:10:47.405 --> 00:10:52.897
Normally, say when Vishnumaya Herself announced

00:10:53.049 --> 00:10:58.408
that Shri Krishna is born and He is existing on this Earth,

00:10:58.781 --> 00:11:03.270
if you see from a practical point of view might think
it's a wrong thing She has done,

00:11:03.580 --> 00:11:08.461
because to tell Kamsa that He exists and He resides,

00:11:09.487 --> 00:11:12.828
is still existing, is giving Him a danger

00:11:13.867 --> 00:11:17.109
and one would have
felt guilty later on - "Oh, why did I do it?"

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:20.810
If I had not told, he would not have known."

00:11:20.913 --> 00:11:25.306
But that's the right thing to be done, that's
the job they have to do.

00:11:27.413 --> 00:11:31.242
So we have to see for ourselves that

00:11:31.282 --> 00:11:35.313
what makes us guilty for small, small things

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:39.925
is actually is our own ego reacting against us and

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:44.234
wants us to reconcile with what mistakes we have committed.

00:11:44.832 --> 00:11:48.371
Like some people feel guilty because

00:11:48.451 --> 00:11:53.139
they have said something they should not have said,

00:11:53.171 --> 00:12:01.776
or maybe because they have done something
which they should not have done normally.

00:12:02.843 --> 00:12:09.166
May not be on a Sahaja Yoga basis, maybe something
else also, very frivolous.

00:12:09.385 --> 00:12:13.383
Like somebody spills - say - coffee.

00:12:13.408 --> 00:12:14.933
They feel guilty.

00:12:15.490 --> 00:12:18.958
Or somebody puts the knife on the other side,

00:12:19.045 --> 00:12:21.760
on the left hand side, then they'll feel guilty.

00:12:21.785 --> 00:12:24.850
I mean such stupid things like that which are

00:12:24.875 --> 00:12:28.630
regarded as norms in the society and people start thinking

00:12:28.655 --> 00:12:35.025
that these norms are very, very important -
as if they are something like a dharma

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:39.015
and you must maintain those
norms.

00:12:39.350 --> 00:12:45.147
But these norms are man-made, most of them
are man-made.

00:12:45.211 --> 00:12:48.599
You see some of them are so stupid and so horrifying

00:12:48.654 --> 00:12:52.596
that I think, in England I feel,
there are some, which must be really

00:12:52.621 --> 00:12:56.455
completely squashed and finished - like shaking hands.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:13:00.736
It's a very bad thing, I think, is to do,
is to shake hands with everyone,

00:13:00.761 --> 00:13:03.862
because God knows what kinds of hands people are having,

00:13:03.887 --> 00:13:06.274
what kinds of vibrations they have.

00:13:06.299 --> 00:13:11.153
Now, when My husband has his reception
sometimes I have to shake hands

00:13:11.178 --> 00:13:19.577
with seven hundred people coming in,
and then seven hundred drunkards going out.

00:13:23.109 --> 00:13:27.768
So, this shaking of hands, I think is a very,
very bad habit.

00:13:27.793 --> 00:13:30.484
It's all right for Sahaja Yogis to shake hands,

00:13:30.532 --> 00:13:34.281
but for others to shake anybody's hand, is better to do Namaste,

00:13:34.306 --> 00:13:37.928
though it might be some a very simple Indian method,

00:13:37.953 --> 00:13:40.567
but I think is the best way is to say, "Namaste",

00:13:40.575 --> 00:13:46.649
because shaking hands can cause
lots of problems to human beings,

00:13:46.838 --> 00:13:50.782
and now with all these diseases coming up and all that,

00:13:50.807 --> 00:13:53.848
I think one has to be very careful about shaking hands.

00:13:54.038 --> 00:13:57.989
Worse than that is in France I find is like

00:13:58.005 --> 00:14:00.679
when you meet someone you must kiss, you see

00:14:00.704 --> 00:14:03.249
- is the worst habit I tell you, horrible.

00:14:03.357 --> 00:14:07.126
But they do kiss you all the time if you go there,

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:11.334
I had very bad shocks to begin with, you see

00:14:11.359 --> 00:14:13.837
anybody would just get you, kiss you here,

00:14:13.862 --> 00:14:16.506
kiss you there, you start looking at the person.

00:14:16.634 --> 00:14:22.024
Now with the fear of AIDS and all that perhaps
they might stop all that nonsense.

00:14:22.322 --> 00:14:24.435
But there is no need to do all,

00:14:24.451 --> 00:14:26.304
this is not a very good way of wishing anyone,

00:14:26.329 --> 00:14:29.138
doesn't show any respect, in both the cases.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:32.016
When you shake hands also there's no respect

00:14:32.041 --> 00:14:34.952
and even when you kiss somebody there is no respect.

00:14:34.977 --> 00:14:37.484
But if you say "Namaste" means "I bow to you",

00:14:37.508 --> 00:14:42.487
Namaste is "I bow to you", is respect,

00:14:42.542 --> 00:14:46.539
and this is one thing we have to do is to respect each other.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:49.940
But when we are not then we feel guilty,

00:14:50.036 --> 00:14:53.813
and like that, you see these all like "Thank you".

00:14:53.924 --> 00:14:55.941
If you have not said, "thank you" to somebody

00:14:55.966 --> 00:14:58.254
then we think we have done a big mistake.

00:14:58.279 --> 00:15:01.048
I mean the amount of thank-you's we do, you know.

00:15:01.073 --> 00:15:03.822
We get so much used to it,

00:15:04.504 --> 00:15:09.695
that even if you see a statue you say
"Thank you very much for your darshan."

00:15:09.933 --> 00:15:12.878
It goes on like that, you see, it's a bit too much.

00:15:12.903 --> 00:15:16.317
Too much "Thank you" becomes a lip service - or "sorry".

00:15:16.411 --> 00:15:21.351
Nowadays, in our times we used to say, "I
beg your pardon" on the phone, but now people

00:15:21.399 --> 00:15:24.978
say, "Sorry, sorry, sorry" I mean sorry for
what?!

00:15:24.978 --> 00:15:29.147
Just can't, that "sorry" goes into left Vishuddhi.

00:15:29.172 --> 00:15:34.089
If you don't hear it's none of your faults,
maybe the fault of the telephone, maybe the

00:15:34.089 --> 00:15:36.689
fault of the other person.

00:15:36.689 --> 00:15:41.219
So, without understanding what is there to
be sorry, just go on saying "Sorry, sorry,

00:15:41.219 --> 00:15:47.209
sorry", feeling sorry for something, is absolutely
boring and such a person can become extremely

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:53.788
boring, since morning till evening he is saying
"I'm sorry for this, I'm sorry for that, I'm

00:15:53.788 --> 00:15:58.629
sorry for this", and all the time feeling
sorry for everything, you feel sorry for that

00:15:58.629 --> 00:15:59.749
person.

00:15:59.749 --> 00:16:08.491
So one has to be in a joyful mood, and doesn't
matter if somebody doesn't say "Sorry", doesn't

00:16:08.516 --> 00:16:09.516
matter.

00:16:09.541 --> 00:16:14.529
But some people can take a very big objection
if you don't say "Thank you" to them.

00:16:14.529 --> 00:16:19.559
Very funny thing is that I have experienced
in England once.

00:16:19.559 --> 00:16:25.309
I was going out - John was there, John was
driving the car, and My daughter was coming

00:16:25.309 --> 00:16:31.429
out of the house so he left the door open
and he just, as soon as she sat down, hardly

00:16:31.429 --> 00:16:35.649
took about five, six seconds, he closed the
door, went round.

00:16:35.649 --> 00:16:40.909
But he didn't say "Thank you" to the fellow
who was standing behind, you see they are

00:16:40.909 --> 00:16:43.038
supposed to be all very rich, cultured, educated
people.

00:16:43.038 --> 00:16:47.399
So this fellow got out of his car, caught
hold of this belt, and he wouldn't allow the

00:16:47.399 --> 00:16:50.348
car to move and the car was moving.

00:16:50.348 --> 00:16:52.339
I couldn't understand what was happening.

00:16:52.339 --> 00:16:54.609
So I asked John, "Stop the car, stop the car."

00:16:54.609 --> 00:16:55.609
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:16:55.609 --> 00:16:56.799
"She didn't say 'Thank you' to me."

00:16:56.799 --> 00:17:00.109
This fellow would have been killed or something
would have happened to him, doesn't matter,

00:17:00.109 --> 00:17:01.329
you should say "Thank you".

00:17:01.329 --> 00:17:07.929
These are the funny norms that we have, so
many of them and sometimes we miss the point,

00:17:07.929 --> 00:17:11.976
sometimes we miss the point because the whole
thing becomes so mechanical.

00:17:12.159 --> 00:17:14.329
It is not mechanical if you say "Thank you".

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:21.613
It's a way of just, even expression or smile
or just a gesture can say that you are thankful

00:17:21.638 --> 00:17:24.728
to people for what they have done.

00:17:24.904 --> 00:17:29.289
But it is a norm, which is created since long,
you know.

00:17:29.314 --> 00:17:34.054
They have dropped out so many things, like
they have dropped out their tailcoats, everything,

00:17:34.054 --> 00:17:37.874
and I think too much thanking and too much
feeling sorry should be dropped out.

00:17:37.874 --> 00:17:41.405
Either you go to the left or to the right.

00:17:41.405 --> 00:17:46.254
So the best thing now is if somebody does
something for you, all right just a smile,

00:17:46.254 --> 00:17:52.654
sometimes say "Thank you" all right, but not
all the time, did you say Thank you?

00:17:52.654 --> 00:17:55.424
Like one child told me "I don't want to go
to their house", I said, "Why?"

00:17:55.424 --> 00:17:59.904
"Because I have to say 'thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you' all the time."

00:17:59.904 --> 00:18:06.724
So children also somehow or another find it's
very artificial, becomes a lip service, and

00:18:06.724 --> 00:18:11.914
this lip service can go anywhere and people
start feeling very sorry for things like - I

00:18:11.914 --> 00:18:14.254
didn't send a Christmas card, so they feel
sorry.

00:18:14.254 --> 00:18:16.014
Christmas card is not important.

00:18:16.014 --> 00:18:19.414
We must see why we have to send a Christmas
card.

00:18:19.414 --> 00:18:20.724
Is to wish this person.

00:18:20.724 --> 00:18:23.463
Do you have that in your heart?

00:18:23.463 --> 00:18:26.614
Did you feel that from your heart?

00:18:26.614 --> 00:18:32.424
Once you start feeling from your heart then
you will never catch your left Vishuddhi.

00:18:32.424 --> 00:18:36.804
It's a very superficial way of avoiding the
mistakes you have committed.

00:18:36.804 --> 00:18:42.164
Now supposing I have not done something which
I should have done, sometimes it happens,

00:18:42.164 --> 00:18:47.523
then I feel it in My heart you know, just
feel it.

00:18:47.523 --> 00:18:48.523
Should have done it.

00:18:48.523 --> 00:18:51.143
If I have not done it then it gets corrected.

00:18:51.143 --> 00:18:54.964
Not only that but for a Sahaja Yogi it works.

00:18:54.964 --> 00:18:59.484
So to feel it in your heart otherwise whatever
is superficial you shouldn't worry.

00:18:59.484 --> 00:19:05.764
You shouldn't worry, you are all Yogis, you
must know you are all saints now, so you don't

00:19:05.764 --> 00:19:07.644
have to worry about small, small things.

00:19:07.644 --> 00:19:12.773
Even if you slap someone is all right, if
it is necessary you can slap people.

00:19:12.773 --> 00:19:18.407
There were yogis used to throw stones at others
just to save themselves from their boredom,

00:19:18.432 --> 00:19:20.288
from their aggression.

00:19:20.313 --> 00:19:24.947
So it's all right, you are all saints, so
saints can do that way.

00:19:24.972 --> 00:19:29.800
I read a very nice story about a king who
was a monk, you see and he had to be a king.

00:19:29.861 --> 00:19:33.491
He didn't want to become a king because he
said, "I am a saintly person.

00:19:33.491 --> 00:19:35.163
I don't want."

00:19:35.188 --> 00:19:40.597
He was a saint, but he was made, he was forced,
to become because there was no one, everybody

00:19:40.622 --> 00:19:43.942
was very happy, and he gave all permission
to do whatever they like.

00:19:43.942 --> 00:19:49.072
But the grandees of that place you see, all
the people who were holding the courts, and

00:19:49.072 --> 00:19:54.212
all that, became very powerful because he
was a very mild person and very kindly person,

00:19:54.212 --> 00:19:59.422
and they just exploited all the villagers,
and they exploited all the poor people, and

00:19:59.422 --> 00:20:04.732
all the farmers, and everybody took away all
their things and they looted them, tortured

00:20:04.732 --> 00:20:11.304
them, and troubled their women, and did all
kinds of monstrous things to his subjects.

00:20:11.636 --> 00:20:13.889
But then he was told about it.

00:20:14.429 --> 00:20:21.110
Then he thought that now I am sitting as a
king here and though I am a saint and as a

00:20:21.135 --> 00:20:23.277
saint I have a duty to perform.

00:20:23.302 --> 00:20:31.807
So he made a very nice plot you see, got very
good people, handful of people who were very,

00:20:31.807 --> 00:20:40.007
very close to him, and on whom he can depend,
and he called all these grandees for a court

00:20:40.007 --> 00:20:47.977
and tell them not to bring any weapons on
them and then cut everybody's neck there - everybody's.

00:20:47.977 --> 00:20:56.417
He was a saint, though he cut everybody's
neck, because these people were horrid.

00:20:56.417 --> 00:20:59.811
To punish them was his job, and he did it
without feeling guilty, without catching on

00:20:59.837 --> 00:21:01.767
the left Vishuddhi.

00:21:01.792 --> 00:21:08.215
So whatever has to be done has to be done,
there's nothing to be sorry about it.

00:21:08.286 --> 00:21:16.038
You don't have to be sorry at all, but, whatever
you feel then if it is not expressed, that

00:21:16.038 --> 00:21:21.611
feeling properly, then you have to feel it
in your heart so that it acts and works - this

00:21:21.636 --> 00:21:24.198
is, of course, for left Vishuddhi.

00:21:24.223 --> 00:21:28.672
But one thing we have to ask ourselves, "How
do we get rid of our left Vishuddhi?"

00:21:28.697 --> 00:21:34.237
And when you start asking this question, "Why
have I got left Vishuddhi?"

00:21:34.237 --> 00:21:37.128
It is the surplus of your ego as I have told
you.

00:21:37.153 --> 00:21:44.723
So try to watch what you have done, try to
see what you have said, why did you do it?

00:21:44.748 --> 00:21:50.946
And then face it, and next time don't do it,
so you won't have the guilt because guilt

00:21:50.946 --> 00:21:57.017
is nothing but a stored up mistakes and, like
going to a priest and saying, "I'm sorry I

00:21:57.017 --> 00:21:59.696
did this, I did that" and again doing the
same thing.

00:21:59.696 --> 00:22:21.917
It amounts to the same because then you don't
correct yourself.

00:22:40.792 --> 00:22:47.303
So this
amounts to one thing, to understand what mistakes

00:22:47.335 --> 00:22:54.794
you have committed, what your ego wants to
feel bad about it, and then do not store it

00:22:54.794 --> 00:22:57.475
up, face it up and never do it again.

00:22:57.475 --> 00:23:01.985
Just we determine "I'll not do it again,"
that's all.

00:23:02.010 --> 00:23:04.399
You have to just say, "I will not do it again"
- whatever it is.

00:23:05.256 --> 00:23:08.416
Face up to it and say that I will not do it
again.

00:23:08.416 --> 00:23:12.568
That's the best way you can manage your left
Vishuddhi.

00:23:12.593 --> 00:23:14.763
Another thing is the announcement.

00:23:14.763 --> 00:23:19.162
If you use your left Vishuddhi for announcement
there cannot be any guilt.

00:23:19.162 --> 00:23:23.973
Without feeling any guilt, without feeling
nervous, without feeling funny about it, you

00:23:23.973 --> 00:23:25.763
have to go on telling about it.

00:23:25.763 --> 00:23:26.763
It works!

00:23:26.763 --> 00:23:27.763
It works very well.

00:23:27.763 --> 00:23:32.764
We need not be now anymore afraid, now I've
been in this country fourteen years, working

00:23:32.789 --> 00:23:36.687
in the West for fourteen years, you can talk
about it very freely.

00:23:36.862 --> 00:23:40.202
Today only they gave Me an example of that.

00:23:40.202 --> 00:23:48.341
That the musicians were coming, and while
coming, one of them happened to go earlier

00:23:48.341 --> 00:23:51.341
and they asked him, "Why are you going to
London?"

00:23:51.341 --> 00:23:54.691
He said, "We are going to sing devotional
songs to Shri Mataji."

00:23:54.716 --> 00:23:55.976
"Who is Shri Mataji?"

00:23:56.001 --> 00:23:57.248
He showed My photograph.

00:23:57.273 --> 00:23:58.273
Finished.

00:23:58.470 --> 00:24:04.443
He never asked them for anything, didn't ask
for their passport, didn't check them or anything.

00:24:04.468 --> 00:24:11.892
Another thing was when they came and the customs
people were there and they asked, "Where are

00:24:11.892 --> 00:24:13.982
you singing, where are you fixed?"

00:24:13.982 --> 00:24:16.262
They said, "We are not fixed anywhere.

00:24:16.262 --> 00:24:23.712
We are just going to sing our musical songs,
our musical devotion for Mother, and we are

00:24:23.712 --> 00:24:27.444
going to sing songs to Her, to Mataji Nirmala
Devi.

00:24:27.469 --> 00:24:29.782
The fellow was an Englishman.

00:24:29.782 --> 00:24:33.931
In Hindi he said, "Thik He.

00:24:33.931 --> 00:24:35.136
Thik He."

00:24:35.438 --> 00:24:38.698
So these things announcement helps a lot.

00:24:39.191 --> 00:24:48.262
For example, wearing a badge, or wearing a,
what you call, a necklace like that, or a

00:24:48.262 --> 00:24:51.961
ring, itself is an announcement that you have
found out the Truth.

00:24:51.986 --> 00:24:58.172
And then, not only that, but also if you want
you should sometimes start wearing a saree,

00:24:58.172 --> 00:25:04.332
doesn't matter, sometimes kurta pyjama, doesn't
matter, on the streets, if you walk about,

00:25:04.332 --> 00:25:05.332
people will know.

00:25:05.332 --> 00:25:08.722
Now some say that if you wear these things
then Mother has said, "No."

00:25:08.722 --> 00:25:10.542
I never said so, that you cannot wear.

00:25:10.542 --> 00:25:11.542
If you like you can wear.

00:25:11.542 --> 00:25:12.542
But there's a freedom to you.

00:25:12.542 --> 00:25:15.752
If you want you can wear it, or if you don't
want, need not wear.

00:25:15.752 --> 00:25:20.592
But the trouble is, sometimes like these Hari
Rama, Hari Krishna women, then they used to

00:25:20.592 --> 00:25:22.402
wear these dresses and go about.

00:25:22.402 --> 00:25:26.442
But they were dirty, filthy, unwashed women.

00:25:26.442 --> 00:25:30.206
In a proper, traditional way, if you wear
sarees, people will appreciate, definitely.

00:25:30.231 --> 00:25:31.231
Why not?

00:25:31.325 --> 00:25:33.561
They would like to see you in sarees.

00:25:33.561 --> 00:25:34.872
If you want you can wear it.

00:25:34.872 --> 00:25:37.032
Will be a good idea for you to go about.

00:25:37.032 --> 00:25:39.301
There's no harm in wearing sarees.

00:25:39.301 --> 00:25:45.972
I think it's very decent dress, and makes
a woman look like a woman much more than pants,

00:25:45.972 --> 00:25:47.912
and those jeans and things like that.

00:25:47.912 --> 00:25:49.212
So it doesn't matter.

00:25:49.212 --> 00:25:51.492
But then don't feel guilty with it.

00:25:51.492 --> 00:25:56.092
If you want to wear it, wear it with daring
and with courage.

00:25:56.092 --> 00:25:58.992
Be a brave person.

00:25:58.992 --> 00:26:03.872
So only the brave people can get rid of their
left Vishuddhi.

00:26:03.872 --> 00:26:06.082
Because you are brave you are doing it.

00:26:06.082 --> 00:26:07.592
That's the culture that has to come.

00:26:07.592 --> 00:26:11.332
We like the sarees, we'll wear, we like the
kurta pyjamas.

00:26:11.332 --> 00:26:14.212
Now in this heat, to wear a three-piece suit.

00:26:14.212 --> 00:26:15.311
Is it good?

00:26:15.311 --> 00:26:21.152
But you'll wear three-piece suit with a tie,
perspiring, in India especially, I don't understand

00:26:21.152 --> 00:26:24.552
how the English can manage with the dress
of England.

00:26:24.552 --> 00:26:27.832
Wearing three-piece suits and with the ties.

00:26:27.832 --> 00:26:30.612
All right, some people can, but not all.

00:26:30.612 --> 00:26:35.421
Those who feel very cold can manage, but not
everybody, cannot do it.

00:26:35.421 --> 00:26:39.692
So why should you wear these dresses which
are not suitable for you?

00:26:39.692 --> 00:26:45.082
But that doesn't mean, in India I've seen
people wearing some sort of a, so-called short

00:26:45.082 --> 00:26:50.792
and a so-called short on top, and moving about,
that's stupid because it is indecent.

00:26:50.792 --> 00:26:53.321
So we cannot wear indecent dresses.

00:26:53.464 --> 00:26:57.362
We have to wear decent dresses but which are
comfortable and decent.

00:26:57.362 --> 00:27:04.612
There is nothing like, we are English, we
are Indian, we are this - we are all universal

00:27:04.612 --> 00:27:05.612
beings.

00:27:05.612 --> 00:27:10.551
And once we accept this, suddenly you jump
into the state of collective consciousness,

00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:12.342
into the state of Virata.

00:27:12.342 --> 00:27:16.882
Once Virata opens out left Vishuddi's finished.

00:27:16.882 --> 00:27:21.662
If you are a part and parcel of the Virata,
how can you make mistakes?

00:27:21.662 --> 00:27:23.552
How can you be guilty?

00:27:23.552 --> 00:27:26.362
Because it is the Virata who takes over.

00:27:26.362 --> 00:27:27.912
He's the One.

00:27:27.912 --> 00:27:31.026
Supposing now in your hand something goes
wrong.

00:27:31.098 --> 00:27:33.387
You don't blame your hand for it.

00:27:33.412 --> 00:27:35.873
What you blame is the body.

00:27:35.937 --> 00:27:38.412
The body has the problem and the body has
to look after.

00:27:38.412 --> 00:27:40.212
The body takes over.

00:27:40.212 --> 00:27:43.622
It comes, repairs, looks after, circulates.

00:27:43.622 --> 00:27:48.068
Whatever it is, pains or whatever it is, the
suggestion comes from the whole body.

00:27:48.093 --> 00:27:52.349
It's not that the only finger starts feeling
guilty - the whole body.

00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:58.770
In the same way, once you jump into that state
of Virata, into the state where you feel I

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.679
am a part and parcel of the whole, Vishuddhi
should drop out.

00:28:02.679 --> 00:28:04.990
Left Vishuddi should completely drop out.

00:28:04.990 --> 00:28:06.530
It has no place.

00:28:06.530 --> 00:28:08.070
It has no place.

00:28:08.070 --> 00:28:13.500
How can you alone feel guilty when you are
part and parcel of the whole?

00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.820
What's the logic?

00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:17.430
You cannot feel guilty.

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:24.570
If you are part and parcel of the whole then
the whole takes over, and this is where you

00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.390
can cut down your left Vishuddhi very well.

00:28:27.390 --> 00:28:32.340
So now we have to come to point where you
have to see what is our destiny.

00:28:32.340 --> 00:28:34.080
Sahaja Yogis have their destinies.

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:36.150
Have you fulfilled your destiny?

00:28:36.150 --> 00:28:40.150
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fashion.

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:46.660
You have not come to Sahaja Yoga out of some
sort of a fan of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:47.660
No!

00:28:47.660 --> 00:28:55.215
You have come here to be saints, all right,
and then what is your destiny?

00:28:57.913 --> 00:29:05.130
Destiny is to become part and parcel of the
whole.

00:29:05.130 --> 00:29:09.620
Have you become part and parcel of the whole?

00:29:09.645 --> 00:29:12.579
The collectivity part of it.

00:29:12.889 --> 00:29:18.076
You still are involved, supposing, into your
own problems - "I should have said this to

00:29:18.101 --> 00:29:22.729
my wife, to my children, to my house," then
you are not part and parcel of the whole.

00:29:23.348 --> 00:29:27.209
But if you just think of other people who
are Sahaja Yogis - how nice they are, they

00:29:27.209 --> 00:29:35.333
are all my brothers and sisters, we belong
to one family, we have to be together, it's

00:29:35.358 --> 00:29:45.466
all one - then what happens, the whole petty
ideas of feeling guilty and all that, disappears

00:29:45.491 --> 00:29:46.514
into thin air.

00:29:46.539 --> 00:29:53.011
It's like one drop of something getting into
the ocean.

00:29:53.011 --> 00:29:55.651
God knows where it has gone.

00:29:55.651 --> 00:29:59.969
It has become such a small speck of a stuff
that you don't even see, don't even feel it,

00:29:59.994 --> 00:30:01.810
what it is.

00:30:04.385 --> 00:30:12.239
So what one has to understand is that we have
to fulfil our destiny and what is our destiny?

00:30:12.476 --> 00:30:21.668
Our destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole and that's how Vishnumaya asserts

00:30:21.765 --> 00:30:23.821
Herself, shines and announces.

00:30:23.821 --> 00:30:27.359
When you have become part and parcel of the
whole, what is there to feel shy to tell about

00:30:27.384 --> 00:30:28.129
it?

00:30:28.154 --> 00:30:29.676
We are saints.

00:30:29.701 --> 00:30:30.781
Of course we are.

00:30:30.806 --> 00:30:31.966
"Are you saints??"

00:30:31.991 --> 00:30:33.151
"Yes, we are."

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:38.894
You have to talk about Sahaja Yoga, you have
to talk about Me, in a very open manner, not

00:30:38.928 --> 00:30:40.443
to feel shy about it.

00:30:40.557 --> 00:30:45.200
We have had a sort of processions and all
that in India.

00:30:45.225 --> 00:30:49.281
But here we dare not have any procession.

00:30:49.281 --> 00:30:54.346
In England, out of question, you see, I don't
know, people feel very shy about it, to have

00:30:54.371 --> 00:30:55.632
a procession.

00:30:55.657 --> 00:30:58.948
But supposing you have a procession then what
happens?

00:30:59.075 --> 00:31:03.689
Then you are just on the television as soon
as you have a procession.

00:31:03.714 --> 00:31:09.401
To bring yourself on the procession you have
to announce and make it a collective effort

00:31:09.401 --> 00:31:11.344
to announce, then you are.

00:31:11.369 --> 00:31:17.531
But I would say we have to wait for one or
two years more, at the most one year more,

00:31:17.531 --> 00:31:22.182
and then we have to go ahead with demonstrations,
with telling people, announcing it, talking

00:31:22.207 --> 00:31:23.207
about it.

00:31:23.293 --> 00:31:28.781
This is what is Vishnumaya and if you start
thinking tonight that what you are going to

00:31:28.781 --> 00:31:32.713
do about it your left Vishuddhi will be cleared
out.

00:31:32.738 --> 00:31:39.731
So much so that I have become deaf on My left
ear, the way you people are sometimes feel

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:41.311
guilty about everything.

00:31:41.311 --> 00:31:45.551
Now don't feel guilty that we have not fulfilled
our destiny.

00:31:45.551 --> 00:31:47.911
That's the trouble.

00:31:47.911 --> 00:31:50.481
Think of it positively.

00:31:50.481 --> 00:31:55.171
You see when you feel guilty you don't think
about it positively - "What I should have

00:31:55.171 --> 00:32:00.631
done, what I should have looked after, how
I should have gone about it, how I should

00:32:00.631 --> 00:32:02.961
have gone further."

00:32:02.986 --> 00:32:09.171
So these things are very important to understand
that if you have to fulfil your destiny, first

00:32:09.171 --> 00:32:14.551
and foremost thing is you must think about
it and understand about it, that what is your

00:32:14.551 --> 00:32:15.551
destiny?

00:32:16.209 --> 00:32:18.899
What have you to become?

00:32:19.042 --> 00:32:23.791
Because now you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
got powers, even if you are caught up, whatever

00:32:23.791 --> 00:32:28.330
may be wrong, you can give realization to
others, you can do lots of marvels, you can

00:32:28.330 --> 00:32:34.142
show lots of credible things that are never
done, people can see for yourself that they

00:32:34.142 --> 00:32:41.281
are, themselves that they are, they see that
yourself is something magical box that it

00:32:41.281 --> 00:32:43.525
can create so many things - it's true.

00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:47.690
But, that is not your destiny.

00:32:47.690 --> 00:32:51.820
The destiny is to become part and parcel of
the whole.

00:32:51.820 --> 00:32:56.371
That's your destiny and to be effective much
more as a part and parcel of the whole, for

00:32:56.371 --> 00:33:00.031
that, first thing you should start is an announcement.

00:33:00.031 --> 00:33:05.301
I was sorry to hear that when they wanted
to have a program and all that to be done,

00:33:05.301 --> 00:33:09.810
only a few people were there putting the posters.

00:33:09.810 --> 00:33:19.251
There should be some method in England, specially
England is a place where people are very sort

00:33:19.251 --> 00:33:23.401
of ... because it's an island, you see, they
also have their islands of their own.

00:33:23.401 --> 00:33:25.710
Everybody has an island, I find, here.

00:33:25.710 --> 00:33:31.391
And they live in an island of their own - "my
family, my house, my, my, my books, my this,

00:33:31.391 --> 00:33:34.940
my, my, my, my that, my that."

00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.731
So they live in an island.

00:33:36.731 --> 00:33:42.101
Now if you tell them that we are having this
program - "Oh, I have no time, and I'm sorry,

00:33:42.101 --> 00:33:45.271
I'm very busy" - or something like that.

00:33:45.271 --> 00:33:46.491
Then they feel guilty.

00:33:46.491 --> 00:33:50.291
"Oh I should have gone, you know, after all,
this and this."

00:33:50.291 --> 00:34:02.671
Now you have joined a movement, a kind of
a Divine upsurge, which has to work out emancipation

00:34:02.671 --> 00:34:04.381
of the whole of humanity.

00:34:04.381 --> 00:34:12.060
Now you cannot have such a mediocre effort
and because of that you suffer every way.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:20.505
All those countries where people have taken
a very great step forward have achieved every

00:34:20.530 --> 00:34:21.530
way.

00:34:21.683 --> 00:34:24.651
They have got money, they have got everything
with them.

00:34:24.651 --> 00:34:32.320
But still if you are worried about this and
worried about that then what happens that

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:38.440
your progress is stopped, in a way, deterred.

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.141
So I would request you not to worry about
anything.

00:34:42.141 --> 00:34:46.106
Just think, "I have to become part and parcel
of the whole."

00:34:46.137 --> 00:34:52.041
That's why last time I requested all the women
to give up this idea of possessing the husband,

00:34:52.041 --> 00:34:54.491
possessing the children, possessing this,
possessing that.

00:34:54.491 --> 00:34:57.058
They don't have to possess anyone.

00:34:57.083 --> 00:35:02.081
What they have to do is to see that they do
not get possessed with such funny ideas, and

00:35:02.081 --> 00:35:05.861
do not try to destroy the collectivity.

00:35:05.861 --> 00:35:14.177
So the collectivity has to be brought in,
in such a way, that people do feel the oneness

00:35:14.202 --> 00:35:20.460
within themselves, and feel that they are
all together, living together, as part and

00:35:20.516 --> 00:35:22.433
parcel of the whole.

00:35:22.458 --> 00:35:28.162
For example, now this finger does some mistake,
I mean this finger gets hurt or something,

00:35:28.187 --> 00:35:32.981
this finger doesn't go and say, "I'm sorry",
does it?

00:35:32.981 --> 00:35:40.231
Or say by mistake, you see, this hand hits
this one, it won't say, "I'm sorry I hit you."

00:35:40.231 --> 00:35:44.341
Because who is the other to say the sorry?

00:35:44.341 --> 00:35:47.959
Who is the other for whom to feel guilty?

00:35:47.984 --> 00:35:49.921
We are all one.

00:35:50.349 --> 00:35:52.244
So what is there to say sorry?

00:35:52.269 --> 00:35:55.229
There is no foreigner within us.

00:35:55.254 --> 00:36:01.943
We are all together and this is how one has
to realize that there is nothing to feel sorry

00:36:01.968 --> 00:36:02.968
or anything.

00:36:02.993 --> 00:36:09.413
I never send any cards to anyone, to be very
frank, cards or flowers, to be very frank,

00:36:09.413 --> 00:36:15.003
because I have no guru and I have no Mataji
to send flowers to.

00:36:15.003 --> 00:36:18.863
If I had somebody I would have sent but I
have no one, to whom should I send?

00:36:18.863 --> 00:36:22.283
Now they are all Mine, so why should I send
it to them?

00:36:22.283 --> 00:36:24.702
They are part and parcel of My being.

00:36:24.702 --> 00:36:27.443
So why should I send this to them?

00:36:27.443 --> 00:36:29.893
But I can nourish them.

00:36:29.893 --> 00:36:35.092
I give them presents because they are part
and parcel of My being.

00:36:35.092 --> 00:36:40.383
So I just give them presents because, you
see, like the heart will nourish some parts

00:36:40.383 --> 00:36:45.283
of the body, the head will nourish some parts
of the body or will do some function of nourishment.

00:36:45.283 --> 00:36:49.623
In the same way one can do it, is to give
presents to each other.

00:36:49.623 --> 00:36:50.623
Think about it.

00:36:50.623 --> 00:36:54.702
Small, small, things I have told you to think
about how to do it.

00:36:54.702 --> 00:36:56.003
It is sometimes so.

00:36:56.003 --> 00:37:05.783
Like once I was singing one song in Marathi
and it was left there, for some time, I didn't

00:37:05.783 --> 00:37:11.483
know how they picked it up from somewhere,
and one day I was just sitting like this and

00:37:11.483 --> 00:37:13.393
they started the song.

00:37:13.393 --> 00:37:19.043
Tears started rolling My eyes, I said, "Look
at that, how thoughtful of them to know about

00:37:19.043 --> 00:37:21.413
that I like this song."

00:37:21.413 --> 00:37:27.243
But when you are not part and parcel of the
whole you can make a tremendous mistakes in

00:37:27.243 --> 00:37:29.812
also pleasing other people.

00:37:29.837 --> 00:37:31.847
The example of that is like this.

00:37:31.847 --> 00:37:35.757
I've been to Sahasrara Puja.

00:37:35.757 --> 00:37:40.933
At the Sahasrara Puja there was a lady in
charge of Me and she was little, I must say,

00:37:40.933 --> 00:37:46.297
I don't know what is to say, but for two and
a half days she gave Me nothing to eat but

00:37:46.329 --> 00:37:47.456
mozzarella cheese.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:51.537
Morning, mozzarella cheese, daytime mozzarella,
evening mozzarella.

00:37:51.537 --> 00:37:56.866
I said, "Must be they are turning short of
money that's why there's no food in the place."

00:37:56.866 --> 00:38:00.169
So I never said anything, I was just eating
nicely, I am not bothered.

00:38:00.194 --> 00:38:03.537
Then somebody came and told Me, "Oh what a
choice we have here."

00:38:03.537 --> 00:38:04.537
"Eh, you have a choice?"

00:38:04.537 --> 00:38:06.427
"Yes, lots of things what's eating."

00:38:06.427 --> 00:38:09.436
I said, "Oh God, I've been eating only mozzarella."

00:38:09.475 --> 00:38:13.437
So they said that, "No these, they told me
that you like mozzarella."

00:38:13.437 --> 00:38:24.437
I said, "All right I like mozzarella - doesn't
mean that I don't eat anything else."

00:38:24.437 --> 00:38:28.016
So this kind of understanding shows what?

00:38:28.016 --> 00:38:33.467
Shows that you have not understood Me at all.

00:38:33.467 --> 00:38:36.317
You have not seen Me.

00:38:36.317 --> 00:38:41.847
Partially you know that once I liked, I said
all right I like mozzarella, so only mozzarella,

00:38:41.847 --> 00:38:43.565
mozzarella, mozzarella.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:49.787
But what I would say that, you see, that,
to understand Me you must know that, to study

00:38:49.787 --> 00:38:54.937
Me, to understand Me, what Mother is, what
She likes, what She doesn't, if you really

00:38:54.937 --> 00:39:01.277
want, I mean I like practically everything,
I eat every, I have no choice of food or anything,

00:39:01.277 --> 00:39:02.277
no choice of anything.

00:39:02.277 --> 00:39:08.217
I like English music, Western music, I like
even some pop music, I like every sort of

00:39:08.217 --> 00:39:12.136
thing, I mean, whichever is good, which has
good vibrations, I like everything.

00:39:12.136 --> 00:39:14.496
I don't make fuss about things.

00:39:14.496 --> 00:39:21.577
But to say that Mother likes this, you see,
and they just stick onto that point, shows

00:39:21.577 --> 00:39:23.126
that they are not collective.

00:39:23.126 --> 00:39:25.297
Collective is to understand Me fully.

00:39:25.297 --> 00:39:31.886
Supposing there is a problem here so all the
blood cells know there is a problem here.

00:39:31.886 --> 00:39:33.157
They all know about it.

00:39:33.157 --> 00:39:35.147
They know about the whole body.

00:39:35.147 --> 00:39:37.516
They just don't know about that particular
cell.

00:39:37.516 --> 00:39:43.667
In the same way, if you know just particularly
about Me this aspect, that aspect, that aspect,

00:39:43.667 --> 00:39:46.386
then I will be starving Myself, I think.

00:39:46.386 --> 00:39:53.047
So to try to understand in all aspects and
for that I think the best way is to know the

00:39:53.047 --> 00:39:55.016
thousand names of the Goddess.

00:39:55.016 --> 00:40:01.207
She's very kind, She's "Shant Mudra" She's
absolutely tranquility, peace.

00:40:01.207 --> 00:40:06.277
On the other side, She's "Roudra" She's the
one who can kill people.

00:40:06.277 --> 00:40:09.053
She can finish people.

00:40:09.078 --> 00:40:12.127
She's absolutely wrathful.

00:40:12.152 --> 00:40:13.407
It's true, I accept, it is so.

00:40:13.407 --> 00:40:16.307
But it is so, so it is so.

00:40:16.307 --> 00:40:20.277
But you must understand My in full ways.

00:40:20.277 --> 00:40:25.677
If you just understand in My one side, for
example, if you just understand Me to be a

00:40:25.677 --> 00:40:32.327
very mild, compassionate, forgiving Mother,
then your are sadly mistaken.

00:40:32.327 --> 00:40:37.126
Because you might have to pay for something
that is very wrong you are doing to Sahaja

00:40:37.126 --> 00:40:44.347
Yoga, you are doing to your brothers and sisters,
maybe doing to yourself, or maybe to Me.

00:40:44.347 --> 00:40:46.777
So the other side will definitely punish you.

00:40:46.777 --> 00:40:55.787
So you must know there are many facets to
Sahaja Yoga and all these facets are to be

00:40:55.787 --> 00:40:57.438
understood properly.

00:40:57.604 --> 00:41:01.776
Many people in the Sahaja Yoga also feel guilty.

00:41:01.776 --> 00:41:05.767
Like now supposing while sitting before Me
they'll start giving bandhan, all right.

00:41:05.767 --> 00:41:10.696
I'll say, "Don't give bandhan when I'm sitting
there," then they'll feel guilty.

00:41:10.696 --> 00:41:15.226
Try to understand the essence of everything.

00:41:15.226 --> 00:41:18.566
You have to go deeper into a subtler understanding.

00:41:18.566 --> 00:41:21.756
Then you will not have this problem of Vishnumaya.

00:41:21.756 --> 00:41:33.213
The subtler understanding should be that we
have to see with our discretion, divine discretion,

00:41:33.253 --> 00:41:35.563
whatever is right and whatever is wrong.

00:41:35.563 --> 00:41:38.104
We don't have to judge it mentally.

00:41:38.104 --> 00:41:41.803
That's why I've seen people they sit down
for meditation for three hours.

00:41:41.803 --> 00:41:42.803
What is the need?

00:41:42.803 --> 00:41:44.423
Ten minutes is sufficient.

00:41:44.423 --> 00:41:49.123
But the thing is when they don't understand
the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga they behave

00:41:49.123 --> 00:41:55.063
in such a funny, gross, maddening manner that
even there have been people who have been

00:41:55.063 --> 00:42:00.764
reporting and saying that Sahaja Yoga is a
thing that makes people mad, they start behaving

00:42:00.764 --> 00:42:05.933
in a funny manner, they do funny actions and
all that.

00:42:05.933 --> 00:42:10.754
So all the subtleties of Sahaja Yoga is to
be understood.

00:42:10.754 --> 00:42:15.004
This is how you will become the part and parcel
of the whole.

00:42:15.004 --> 00:42:16.454
The subtleties of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:16.454 --> 00:42:22.083
There are many who do not know even what are
the chakras on the feet are.

00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:29.413
They do not know what is the way one has to
behave in Sahaja Yoga so that we express our

00:42:29.413 --> 00:42:32.343
maximum love.

00:42:32.343 --> 00:42:35.913
So many there are ways of handling things.

00:42:35.913 --> 00:42:43.244
If you really accept that you have to be a
subtler being you'll be surprised, you will

00:42:43.244 --> 00:42:49.873
be endowed with such capacities that you can
handle any number of people, anytime, any

00:42:49.873 --> 00:42:53.123
nationality, you will know everything about
it.

00:42:53.123 --> 00:42:55.903
Because subtlety means you go to the essence
of everything.

00:42:55.903 --> 00:43:02.474
If you go to the essence of everything then
you start seeing what is built on the essence.

00:43:02.474 --> 00:43:09.534
It is very easy to deal with a person if you
see the essence of everything.

00:43:09.534 --> 00:43:16.204
So for Sahaja Yoga it is important to know
that left Vishuddhi is just avoiding the subject.

00:43:16.204 --> 00:43:18.464
You are not facing it.

00:43:18.464 --> 00:43:21.814
Secondly, you cannot go to the subtler thing.

00:43:21.814 --> 00:43:27.704
Another thing, which catches left Vishuddhi
is of course smoking, as you know drugs, and

00:43:27.704 --> 00:43:32.224
also tobacco, is very bad for left Vishuddhi.

00:43:32.224 --> 00:43:40.554
But the worst of all in the left Vishuddhi,
is the mantras given by wrong gurus.

00:43:40.554 --> 00:43:43.393
Because that is the essence.

00:43:43.393 --> 00:43:48.474
Mantras are the essence of what one says.

00:43:48.474 --> 00:43:53.524
So what happens to you, that if your left
Vishuddhi is not all right, even if you say

00:43:53.524 --> 00:43:55.994
mantras, they are not effective.

00:43:55.994 --> 00:44:05.433
Whatever mantras you say with your left Vishuddhi
are still half-baked, are not fully vibrated,

00:44:05.433 --> 00:44:07.774
because of left Vishuddhi problem.

00:44:07.774 --> 00:44:13.774
But if you say Mantras without the left Vishuddhi
problem then the mantras become absolutely

00:44:13.774 --> 00:44:22.652
complete, or most effective, or as you say,
that Purnatwa is the completion.

00:44:22.677 --> 00:44:23.884
It has the full effect.

00:44:51.351 --> 00:45:01.902
So this is one thing is to see that you make
everyone understand that we are all collectively

00:45:01.927 --> 00:45:08.937
bound, and then you won't feel like hurting
anyone, or troubling anyone, or saying anything

00:45:08.937 --> 00:45:09.937
bad.

00:45:09.937 --> 00:45:12.846
But if you are not collectively conscious
then you will do it.

00:45:12.846 --> 00:45:13.866
You will do it.

00:45:13.866 --> 00:45:16.397
You will hurt others.

00:45:16.397 --> 00:45:17.397
You will torture others.

00:45:17.397 --> 00:45:18.397
You will take advantage of them.

00:45:18.397 --> 00:45:21.266
You might exploit them, you might do anything.

00:45:21.266 --> 00:45:26.137
But if you know you are part and parcel of
the whole, if you know, in the sense, if you

00:45:26.137 --> 00:45:31.437
know on your central nervous system when it
becomes part and parcel of your being that

00:45:31.437 --> 00:45:38.116
you know, it is a sort of an awareness within
you which makes you feel that you are part

00:45:38.116 --> 00:45:44.177
and parcel of the whole, you cannot commit
mistakes, and then you do not feel guilty.

00:45:44.177 --> 00:45:54.466
So today is the day of a very big relationship
between brother and sister where a sister

00:45:54.466 --> 00:45:57.427
never feels guilty and brother never feels
guilty.

00:45:57.427 --> 00:46:02.457
Sisters and brothers should never feel guilty
about themselves and they should always openly

00:46:02.457 --> 00:46:06.887
tell whatever they think wrong or whatever
they think is right.

00:46:06.887 --> 00:46:11.856
There is no harm, a sister can always go and
correct the brother, and a brother can always

00:46:11.856 --> 00:46:13.743
come and correct the sister.

00:46:13.768 --> 00:46:19.748
This is the relationship in which nobody should
feel hurt and bad, because this is the purest

00:46:19.748 --> 00:46:22.349
relationship that you could think of.

00:46:22.349 --> 00:46:28.208
As mother, if she tells something, the difference
of age is so much that you may not understand.

00:46:28.208 --> 00:46:33.628
Maybe if the father says something the children
may not understand, the difference of age

00:46:33.628 --> 00:46:39.538
is too much and also the norms that we have
created of saying that there's a generation

00:46:39.538 --> 00:46:42.978
gap and all this nonsense that is also in
the head.

00:46:42.978 --> 00:46:48.968
But supposing a brother and sister, if they,
between themselves, understand Sahaja Yoga,

00:46:48.968 --> 00:46:55.278
they have every right to say whatever is wrong
between them and work it out - not to put

00:46:55.278 --> 00:46:56.918
it as a guilt.

00:46:56.918 --> 00:46:59.959
But now with Rakhi sister is even better.

00:46:59.959 --> 00:47:05.788
Now with Rakhi sister we have established
a beautiful atmosphere that somebody who is

00:47:05.788 --> 00:47:10.859
a brother, you cannot have any funny relationships
with that person.

00:47:10.859 --> 00:47:17.339
It kills all your flirtations, all your funny,
funny relationships that one develops, all

00:47:17.339 --> 00:47:28.139
kinds of marriage breaking problems, and people
going astray, once you have understood the

00:47:28.139 --> 00:47:35.258
principle that we have to first settle ourselves
on very holy relationship with each other.

00:47:35.258 --> 00:47:40.668
This is the way, in Sahaja Yoga, we establish
that holy relationship.

00:47:40.668 --> 00:47:49.468
And moreover, one has to see that this holy
relationship gives you joy, happiness, and

00:47:49.468 --> 00:47:50.468
pleasure.

00:47:50.468 --> 00:47:55.929
It is not just a holy relationship of some
force or some sort of a thing.

00:47:55.929 --> 00:47:59.988
Even if you cannot give anything to your sister,
or the brother cannot do anything for the

00:47:59.988 --> 00:48:01.138
sister, doesn't matter.

00:48:01.138 --> 00:48:07.708
The relationship is in the heart, and is felt
very much and when you feel it, that relationship,

00:48:07.708 --> 00:48:12.609
that sweetness of purity, of holiness, flows.

00:48:12.609 --> 00:48:16.978
I know of some people who have sacrificed
such a lot for the brothers and so much for

00:48:16.978 --> 00:48:18.709
the sisters.

00:48:18.709 --> 00:48:24.958
So one has to understand this relationship
is to be kept very clean, beautiful, and absolutely

00:48:24.958 --> 00:48:28.125
open - there should be no formality in it.

00:48:28.150 --> 00:48:32.056
That a brother should go and say, "I'm sorry,"
and the sister should go and say, "I'm sorry."

00:48:32.081 --> 00:48:37.198
You have to be open and tell - you should
never feel bad about your brother or sister.

00:48:37.198 --> 00:48:39.762
But it can be the other way around.

00:48:39.787 --> 00:48:45.337
I have seen people, like there was a bhootish
woman, who turned out to be very bhootish,

00:48:45.337 --> 00:48:49.107
and then somebody said, "But she's my Rakhi
sister."

00:48:49.107 --> 00:48:50.247
So what?

00:48:50.247 --> 00:48:53.148
As soon as she becomes bhootish there's no
Rakhi.

00:48:53.148 --> 00:48:56.363
Impurity, any impurity walking in, no Rakhi
anymore.

00:48:56.388 --> 00:48:57.443
Finished.

00:48:57.468 --> 00:48:59.038
That's broken long time back.

00:48:59.063 --> 00:49:02.278
You have to have pure relationships of pure
personalities.

00:49:02.303 --> 00:49:07.668
You cannot have impure personalities, "and
then I must help, I have a weakness for the"

00:49:07.668 --> 00:49:12.658
- it has created lots of problems for Me in
America this Rakhi sister business, you see,

00:49:12.658 --> 00:49:19.077
she's the Rakhi sister of that, and this Rakhi
sister just started creating a kind of a problem

00:49:19.077 --> 00:49:28.778
of a, we can say, intrigue, and she started
telephoning to her Rakhi brothers, and all

00:49:28.778 --> 00:49:32.009
Rakhi brothers joined in that intrigue.

00:49:32.469 --> 00:49:35.987
It should not, in any way, cover your discretion.

00:49:35.987 --> 00:49:39.507
That's why the discretion stands in between.

00:49:39.507 --> 00:49:43.557
To understand when Rakhi sister is telling
you something - is it going against Sahaja

00:49:43.557 --> 00:49:44.844
Yoga or for Sahaja Yoga?

00:49:44.869 --> 00:49:47.457
That discretion is in between.

00:49:47.457 --> 00:49:54.577
Before you go to this point you have a discretion
here to see for yourself that this Rakhi relationship

00:49:54.577 --> 00:50:00.807
has to be nourishing, supporting, helping
Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:00.807 --> 00:50:05.457
Other than that it doesn't exist.

00:50:05.457 --> 00:50:10.117
We are brothers and sisters in Sahaja Yoga.

00:50:10.142 --> 00:50:19.045
Anything that breaks it, there's no relationship
at all, anyway.

00:50:19.378 --> 00:50:26.557
If you understand this simple thing I think
we have done a good job today.

00:50:26.582 --> 00:50:29.023
May God Bless you!

00:50:31.882 --> 00:50:34.962
Now for a puja, we should have a very simple puja.

00:50:34.994 --> 00:50:38.152
Actually, I was saying there’s no need to give Me a saree

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:42.065
because I am not anybody’s sister or a brother.

00:50:47.804 --> 00:50:50.380
But Rakhi day, My brother is here.

00:50:50.420 --> 00:50:57.694
It’s nice that we can have it in a way My physical brother is here.

00:50:58.163 --> 00:51:04.580
It’s very good we are having a rakhi program today in his presence.

00:51:04.787 --> 00:51:12.867
And, all of you should also understand
that it’s a very subtle, pure,

00:51:12.954 --> 00:51:19.514
beautiful relationship that exists between a brother and a sister.

00:51:19.644 --> 00:51:22.834
Talk after puja 03:38

03:38:01.327 --> 03:38:06.607
Tomorrow of course you all can rest and enjoy yourself.

03:38:06.768 --> 03:38:09.659
But day after tomorrow is the programme

03:38:10.324 --> 03:38:12.724
for these musicians who have come.

03:38:12.814 --> 03:38:15.943
But I was thinking we should also combine

03:38:16.078 --> 03:38:19.175
some of you with them when they are singing

03:38:19.231 --> 03:38:21.694
so you also could bring your

03:38:21.790 --> 03:38:26.445
as we call them, to play with them.

03:38:27.366 --> 03:38:31.931
Plus we could have some nice English music also,

03:38:32.067 --> 03:38:34.816
a few English nice music things, you see.

03:38:34.983 --> 03:38:38.416
This is American, this she has [sung]:

03:38:38.686 --> 03:38:40.864
The Whole World In Your Hands is American.

03:38:40.889 --> 03:38:44.684
So why not something English which is faster, one or two?

03:38:44.780 --> 03:38:47.695
So, also you should play something English.

03:38:47.775 --> 03:38:52.611
Also bring your maridas  (bells) it’s better
that you should bring them.

03:38:53.104 --> 03:38:56.045
And I hope you will all be there

03:38:56.411 --> 03:38:59.930
and you’ll be there to sing these.

03:38:59.986 --> 03:39:02.051
If you sing these Hindi songs

03:39:02.086 --> 03:39:05.522
and Marathi songs they’ll be all surprised.

03:39:05.665 --> 03:39:10.161
You see, nobody has picked up these things
so fast as you people have.

03:39:10.312 --> 03:39:13.245
It shows that, once you have your Self-realisation,

03:39:13.349 --> 03:39:18.343
you can pick up any music, you can pick up any kind of a

03:39:18.784 --> 03:39:21.156
rhythm very easily.

03:39:21.553 --> 03:39:29.291
And we can show them that we are all united,
we are one religion,

03:39:29.370 --> 03:39:33.566
what we call as the ‘pure religion’ which is within us.

03:39:33.860 --> 03:39:39.629
We do not believe in separating people

03:39:40.003 --> 03:39:43.469
who say that, “This religion is good,”
or “That religion is good.”

03:39:43.603 --> 03:39:48.337
All religions are good if they are taken in their proper essences.

03:39:48.418 --> 03:39:55.479
So we don’t have to part up ourselves
along religion of all the things.

03:39:55.861 --> 03:40:00.413
So our religion is Pure Religion which is innate,
which is within us,

03:40:00.590 --> 03:40:08.000
which we know about and which we know
how to cleanse and how to use it.

03:40:08.103 --> 03:40:12.347
This is a very great thing of Sahaj Yoga

03:40:12.569 --> 03:40:17.051
that we are all united together in our Spirits,

03:40:17.432 --> 03:40:21.732
not in the outward show or outward things.

03:40:21.757 --> 03:40:25.155
And this is what you have to show them that we are all united:

03:40:25.235 --> 03:40:27.634
whatever country you may come from,

03:40:27.745 --> 03:40:31.105
whatever background you may come from,

03:40:31.225 --> 03:40:33.395
we are all one within ourselves.

03:40:33.427 --> 03:40:36.705
And this is what the world needs today this oneness.

03:40:38.581 --> 03:40:41.594
Also this warmongering and all that comes from

03:40:41.667 --> 03:40:47.932
too much of greed and too much of ambitions
which  we do not have;

03:40:48.076 --> 03:40:51.287
we have crossed all that, we are satisfied people.

03:40:51.454 --> 03:40:57.181
So we don’t fight each other for small things
or for countries or for nations

03:40:57.206 --> 03:41:00.079
because the whole world is made by one God,

03:41:00.278 --> 03:41:02.266
and He rules the whole world.

03:41:02.291 --> 03:41:05.951
It’s stupidity to feel, “This is my country, this is your country,”

03:41:05.976 --> 03:41:08.478
and then fight and do all kind of things.

03:41:09.090 --> 03:41:13.482
So we don’t believe in all this mess
and these human made differences.

03:41:13.522 --> 03:41:19.832
We believe in the oneness of our

03:41:20.521 --> 03:41:24.401
belief and in our understanding

03:41:24.427 --> 03:41:28.088
on our central nervous system, that we know the truth,

03:41:28.143 --> 03:41:31.016
this is the truth and we believe in that truth.

03:41:31.186 --> 03:41:35.584
So tomorrow we have to show with our patience and our love

03:41:35.609 --> 03:41:40.425
and affection to these English people.
I hope something will go into their heads also,

03:41:40.450 --> 03:41:45.501
as it has happened in Switzerland.
We have to break their ices.

03:41:46.038 --> 03:41:50.270
Tomorrow it should be arranged in such a way
that they should feel that there’s no quarrel,

03:41:50.278 --> 03:41:52.385
there’s no argument, there’s no struggle,

03:41:52.386 --> 03:41:56.078
nothing; we are so smoothly, all of us are, together,

03:41:56.103 --> 03:41:58.477
to help each other to work it out

03:41:58.509 --> 03:42:00.670
and to be kind  to each other.

03:42:00.822 --> 03:42:06.246
I will be happy if you can provide some kind of a refreshment also,

03:42:07.448 --> 03:42:11.124
so that they will feel that there is something.

03:42:11.236 --> 03:42:15.477
And very loving and good mannered you must talk to all of them.

03:42:15.645 --> 03:42:18.783
We could also have some dancing there, doesn’t matter.

03:42:18.887 --> 03:42:21.376
We can have some dancing and something.

03:42:21.432 --> 03:42:24.196
And now for dancing you must little bit practice.

03:42:24.291 --> 03:42:27.389
Should be in some rhythms, you see.

03:42:34.799 --> 03:42:40.081
But should be nice and beautifully done and should be proper.

03:42:40.106 --> 03:42:43.986
And dancing is an expression of the body of your joy

03:42:44.034 --> 03:42:46.197
and should be in proper rhythm.

03:42:46.221 --> 03:42:49.046
I was surprised, this time when I came,

03:42:49.086 --> 03:42:54.449
I saw, I think it was in two, three films,

03:42:54.513 --> 03:42:58.117
documentaries, they were showing dancing as a theme:

03:42:58.136 --> 03:43:01.188
how dancing has evolved, how dancing is important,

03:43:01.215 --> 03:43:02.842
how it has to by rhythmic.

03:43:02.875 --> 03:43:05.034
They were also showing about African dancing,

03:43:05.059 --> 03:43:09.833
how it is so artistic and beautifully done.

03:43:09.992 --> 03:43:13.042
So I mean, this has started already,

03:43:13.075 --> 03:43:15.578
to feel that dancing in proper rhythm

03:43:15.587 --> 03:43:20.312
and proper ecstasy is an expression of the inner joy.

03:43:20.354 --> 03:43:23.314
But should not be frantic and should not be funny

03:43:23.347 --> 03:43:26.762
and I don’t think we should shout much in between shown

03:43:26.859 --> 03:43:31.434
but we can say something nice, that would be better:

03:43:31.499 --> 03:43:33.929
in a way that it should not look [like] vulgar dancing,

03:43:33.954 --> 03:43:35.501
that’s what I want to say.

03:43:35.532 --> 03:43:39.020
You, yourselves have to judge it; now you are all great saints

03:43:39.045 --> 03:43:40.985
and walis and prophets so

03:43:41.017 --> 03:43:44.847
I have to keep my words,

03:43:44.879 --> 03:43:48.301
discreetly for you to judge yourself and to say things

03:43:48.341 --> 03:43:51.335
and to do things which are sensible.

03:43:51.407 --> 03:43:54.506
So we’ll have somebody as a compere

03:43:54.538 --> 03:43:57.445
and somebody who has to say things properly,

03:43:57.470 --> 03:44:02.068
to explain things beforehand so that nobody gets

03:44:02.078 --> 03:44:06.033
sort of worried or upset or bored — that’s the main thing.

03:44:06.074 --> 03:44:10.514
And you should not have many songs with the slow tone.

03:44:10.539 --> 03:44:16.085
I think even in English music
they should start with very fast numbers.

03:44:17.288 --> 03:44:20.795
‘Ai giri nandini’ or they can start with ‘Jogawa’ or something

03:44:20.812 --> 03:44:23.411
and then end up also with fast tones.

03:44:23.442 --> 03:44:27.251
But should be slow because they don’t understand any language.
