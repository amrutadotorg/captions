00:00:01.465 --> 00:00:03.895
We cannot meditate

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.390
we only can be in meditation

00:00:08.895 --> 00:00:12.110
When we say we are going to meditate

00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:14.110
it has no meaning

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.410
We have to be in meditation

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.255
Either you are inside the house or outside the house

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:31.101
You cannot be inside the house and then say that: “Now I’m outside the house.”

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:36.135
Or when you are outside the house you cannot say: “I’m inside the house.”

00:00:36.625 --> 00:00:38.040
In the same way

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:43.631
you are moving in three dimensions of your life

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.575
– of emotional and physical and mental being

00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:52.041
You are not inside yourself.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:01.985
But when you are inside that you are in thoughtless awareness.

00:01:02.365 --> 00:01:04.435
Then, not only that you are there

00:01:04.635 --> 00:01:06.540
but you are everywhere

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.551
because that is the place

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.201
that is the point where you are really in universal…

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.900
From there you are in contact with the Principle

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.991
with the Shakti, with the Power that permeates into every particle

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.225
that is matter , into every thought that is emotion

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:36.881
into every planning and thinking of the whole world.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:47.360
You permeate into all the elements that have created this beautiful Earth

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.931
You permeate into earth

00:01:52.325 --> 00:01:56.131
you permeate into Akasha [sky, ether]

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.341
into teja [light]

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.351
into sound

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:07.961
But your movement is very slow.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.395
Then you say: “I’m meditating,”

00:02:13.105 --> 00:02:23.315
that means you are moving in permeation with the Universal Being

00:02:24.085 --> 00:02:27.091
But you are not moving yourself

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.495
you are just unloading yourself to be free

00:02:31.695 --> 00:02:37.821
from the weight of things that do not allow you to move

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:48.911
When you are in meditation you must allow yourself to be in thoughtless awareness

00:02:49.515 --> 00:02:55.571
There, the Unconscious Itself, the Achetana itself will take charge of you

00:02:56.525 --> 00:03:00.991
You will start moving with the force of Achetana.

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:04.030
The Unconscious is going to work it out.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.545
It is going to take you there, where It wants you to go

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.611
You keep to thoughtless awareness all the time.

00:03:14.075 --> 00:03:18.240
Try to keep to thoughtless awareness as much as you can.

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.495
When you are in thoughtless awareness

00:03:20.695 --> 00:03:24.495
you must know that you are in the Kingdom of God

00:03:24.845 --> 00:03:32.460
and His people , His arrangements, His consciousness

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.631
is going to look after you.

00:03:36.795 --> 00:03:40.135
Even when you are giving vibrations to other people

00:03:40.395 --> 00:03:44.750
I have noticed that you are not in thoughtless awareness.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:48.455
If you give vibrations in thoughtless awareness

00:03:48.655 --> 00:03:51.321
you will not catch anything

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.970
because all these entities that enter into you

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.560
all these material problems that come into you

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:06.731
come when you are in those three dimensions.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.995
Through Sahaja Yoga

00:04:10.195 --> 00:04:14.961
you have opened your gates of your own being.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.950
You have entered into your own kingdom

00:04:18.335 --> 00:04:21.340
but you do not keep there.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:23.365
You come out of it

00:04:23.565 --> 00:04:26.980
and again you go back and settle down – doesn’t matter

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.181
You should not feel so disappointed about it, so frustrated.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:33.860
You know people have worked for thousands of years

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:38.510
and they could not separate themselves from themselves

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.971
Only you people, the Sahaja Yogis

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:47.380
whom are made after the pattern of Shri Ganesh himself

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.501
are so powerful

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.905
that they can give awakening and realisation to other people.

00:04:57.565 --> 00:05:00.910
Even if you are caught up, you have seen you have powers.

00:05:01.215 --> 00:05:04.080
Even if you feel that the vibrations are not coming

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:06.005
you know you have powers.

00:05:06.205 --> 00:05:08.130
You can give realisations to others.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.530
In your presence people get realisation

00:05:12.135 --> 00:05:16.571
But you have to be that power completely.

00:05:17.805 --> 00:05:20.135
Supposing there’s something wrong with your car

00:05:20.615 --> 00:05:22.585
: But as long as it is moving

00:05:22.875 --> 00:05:23.725
it’s alright.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:25.300
You have to repair it.

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:30.685
You have to repair all the time all our moods

00:05:30.885 --> 00:05:34.825
which we have caused ourselves by our foolishness

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.525
by our lust, by our greed

00:05:38.835 --> 00:05:45.025
by so many false identifications we carried with ourselves.

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:50.420
We must have a complete attention towards our weaknesses

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.915
and not towards our achievements.

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:56.405
If we know what are our weaknesses it’s better

00:05:56.605 --> 00:06:01.481
that we can really swim across better.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:06.685
Supposing, on a ship there is a hole

00:06:07.275 --> 00:06:10.725
and the water is coming in through that hole

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:15.650
the attention of all the crew, of all the staff

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:22.510
and the captain itself will be on that hole from where the water is coming in, and nowhere else.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.170
In the same way, you must be on the watch-out.

00:06:27.670 --> 00:06:32.740
There are so many pitfalls for a Sahaja Yogi – I have seen it.

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:38.095
Of course, even the past is over

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:40.791
even the past can be overcome.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:49.735
In the present also they have many shadows of the past working.

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:54.260
For example, when you are sitting in a group

00:06:54.575 --> 00:06:58.550
you are involved with each other.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.630
Those who are involved with each other

00:07:01.830 --> 00:07:05.035
by any relationship whatsoever

00:07:05.605 --> 00:07:10.655
must know that this kind of involvement

00:07:10.855 --> 00:07:18.285
is not going to help them to attain their individual ascent.

00:07:18.565 --> 00:07:25.275
Everybody is ascending individually though you are collectively contacted with each other

00:07:25.475 --> 00:07:27.205
and in communication;

00:07:27.405 --> 00:07:30.235
but the ascendance is individual

00:07:30.435 --> 00:07:32.271
absolutely individual.

00:07:32.745 --> 00:07:37.505
So whether he is your son, brother, sister, wife, friend

00:07:37.805 --> 00:07:44.235
you must remember that you are not responsible for their ascendance.

00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:47.790
You cannot help them for their ascendance.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.865
Only Mother’s Grace and their own desire

00:07:54.220 --> 00:07:56.850
their own effort, to give up all that

00:07:57.050 --> 00:08:01.615
is three dimensional will help them.

00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:04.525
So whenever a thought comes like that

00:08:04.725 --> 00:08:14.165
you must know that you have not attained the thoughtless awareness in its full extent

00:08:14.585 --> 00:08:16.555
and that’s how you have problems

00:08:16.755 --> 00:08:19.220
which are three-dimensional.

00:08:19.645 --> 00:08:22.080
Sometimes, a Sahaja Yogi will find

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.755
an emotion will come into his mind.

00:08:25.050 --> 00:08:28.665
It will be an emotion of dejection or frustration

00:08:28.865 --> 00:08:34.740
and he will be disgusted with himself or with others.

00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:37.210
Both things are just the same

00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:41.681
I have seen some Sahaja Yogis get very disgusted with others.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:45.355
There should be no disgust that is lasting.

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:46.680
Of course, for a short time

00:08:46.880 --> 00:08:49.945
you might feel a disgust. It’s alright. It’s a passing phase

00:08:50.455 --> 00:08:53.621
Or you might feel disgusted with yourself –

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:56.000
may be a passing phase.

00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.845
But if you go on hankering on to it

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:02.325
or if you go on clinging to it

00:09:02.595 --> 00:09:06.395
that means you are conditioning yourself

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.160
that means you are not in thoughtless awareness

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:13.745
that means that you are in your past

00:09:13.945 --> 00:09:19.051
you are making your past a solid mass on your head.

00:09:19.775 --> 00:09:22.670
In the present everything is fleeting.

00:09:22.995 --> 00:09:29.505
Everything is fleeting that is not eternal

00:09:29.925 --> 00:09:32.410
In the present the eternal stays

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:35.125
the rest all drops out

00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.081
It’s like a moving river which doesn’t stop anywhere

00:09:39.350 --> 00:09:42.351
But the moving river is eternal.

00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:44.930
The rest of the things are all changing.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.795
If you are on the Eternal Principle

00:09:48.305 --> 00:09:52.640
all that is not eternal changes

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.640
and drops out

00:09:54.845 --> 00:10:00.060
dissolves and becomes nonexistent.

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.580
We have to understand our own dignity

00:10:04.885 --> 00:10:08.891
our own essence.

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:16.060
The first and foremost is that all the Sahaja Yogis are the chosen ones

00:10:16.715 --> 00:10:20.781
They are the people whom God has chosen

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.791
In this city of Delhi there are thousands and thousands of people.

00:10:26.205 --> 00:10:32.555
All over the world there are so many people that we are suffering from overpopulation

00:10:33.135 --> 00:10:37.735
but in Sahaja Yoga there are very, very few people.

00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:43.000
And when you are chosen

00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:49.010
the first, you must also realise that you are the foundations.

00:10:49.365 --> 00:10:52.010
You are the stones that are to be laid down

00:10:52.210 --> 00:10:55.205
and have to be strong

00:10:56.015 --> 00:11:01.541
have to be forbearing

00:11:02.350 --> 00:11:07.795
and that’s why it is necessary that all of you who are now few

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:11.620
who are the first lamps

00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.205
that are going to enlighten other lamps in the world

00:11:17.155 --> 00:11:23.780
you have to enjoy the strength of eternity

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:27.605
the strength of Divine Love

00:11:27.805 --> 00:11:31.950
the strength of this Universal Being that you are.

00:11:32.305 --> 00:11:34.510
This is what meditation is.

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:36.830
So when Sahaja Yogis ask me:

00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:38.580
“What should we do for meditation?”

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:41.890
You be in thoughtless awareness that’s all

00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:43.735
Don’t do anything.

00:11:43.935 --> 00:11:51.325
At that time, not [only] that you are moving towards the goal

00:11:52.565 --> 00:11:55.675
or that the Unconscious is taking charge of you

00:11:55.925 --> 00:11:58.890
not only that, but also that you are emitting

00:11:59.090 --> 00:12:00.980
for the first time

00:12:02.145 --> 00:12:06.010
the Divine into the nature

00:12:06.900 --> 00:12:09.665
into your surroundings

00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:11.800
into other people

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.605
who are universally connected to you

00:12:18.380 --> 00:12:23.761
Only thing is that we are used to one thing

00:12:24.345 --> 00:12:26.745
that is we must do something about it

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:31.255
and so that’s why we start doing something

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:37.791
Meditation is the most Sahaja method.

00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:44.595
Then we have prayers and we have also puja.

00:12:45.075 --> 00:12:47.525
Prayers are also

00:12:47.725 --> 00:12:50.755
if said in your heart

00:12:51.135 --> 00:12:55.065
with the feeling of complete surrendering

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.735
and asking for the Eternal

00:13:00.080 --> 00:13:02.450
it will be granted.

00:13:03.135 --> 00:13:14.070
Just ask for that and the rest will take [you] step-by-step.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:17.695
All the Sahaja Yogis have a problem.

00:13:17.935 --> 00:13:20.195
And they have problems because of their past

00:13:20.395 --> 00:13:24.231
because of their future aspirations.

00:13:24.885 --> 00:13:27.975
Now when you have problems

00:13:28.175 --> 00:13:32.261
in Sahaja Yoga you have learnt how to overcome them.

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:38.075
There are so many methods other than meditation

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:40.230
you know them very well that

00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:45.200
you must know what is the chakra where the Kundalini is.

00:13:45.800 --> 00:13:48.165
Now, if the Kundalini has been stopped

00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:52.315
by a certain chakra which is not working

00:13:52.590 --> 00:13:55.451
you shouldn’t get frustrated about it.

00:13:55.975 --> 00:14:02.755
Supposing your instrument or your car has stopped on the way

00:14:03.330 --> 00:14:06.035
what’s the use of getting frustrated with it?

00:14:06.235 --> 00:14:09.145
You have to learn the mechanism

00:14:09.450 --> 00:14:11.650
You have to be a good technician

00:14:11.850 --> 00:14:15.040
and then you can manage it very well

00:14:15.560 --> 00:14:21.151
So all the techniques of Sahaja Yoga must be learned and mastered

00:14:21.530 --> 00:14:23.660
This you can only do by giving it to others

00:14:23.860 --> 00:14:28.290
and learning from correcting them and correcting yourself.

00:14:29.135 --> 00:14:30.415
There is nothing to be frustrated.

00:14:30.615 --> 00:14:31.695
That’s the worst thing.

00:14:31.895 --> 00:14:33.175
If you get frustrated

00:14:33.375 --> 00:14:35.590
and unhappy with yourself

00:14:35.875 --> 00:14:38.195
then there is going to be a problem.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.335
You have to laugh at yourself

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.390
and laugh at your mechanism that is out of gear

00:14:46.980 --> 00:14:51.581
When you start identifying yourself even with the instrument

00:14:51.865 --> 00:14:56.115
then you are not there

00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.361
You are not the chakras

00:14:58.585 --> 00:15:03.425
you are not the different channels

00:15:03.625 --> 00:15:06.861
You are the awareness

00:15:07.190 --> 00:15:10.991
you are the power, you are the Kundalini

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:21.611
So you don’t have to worry about all these things being not in their proper conditions

00:15:22.225 --> 00:15:25.700
If they are not, you can solve it.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:27.790
Just now the lights went off

00:15:28.305 --> 00:15:32.270
If the lights have went off because of the electricity failure

00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:34.011
it’s a serious thing.

00:15:34.265 --> 00:15:38.045
But if the lights have gone out because there is a fused bulb

00:15:38.245 --> 00:15:41.830
oh, you can replace it, you can do all that.

00:15:42.315 --> 00:15:45.955
So there is no need to worry if your chakras are spoilt.

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.360
Worrying itself, or frustrating yourself

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.660
itself is a wrong attitude towards Sahaja Yoga

00:15:53.270 --> 00:15:56.225
‘Sahaja’, in other terminology also means

00:15:56.425 --> 00:15:59.075
is ‘a simple thing’.

00:15:59.275 --> 00:16:02.560
‘Sahaja’means to be Sahaja means in

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.580
I can say how Tulsidas (Kabir) has said:

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.740
“Jaise rakha hu taise hi rahu” [You keep me as you like].

00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.680
That kind of an attitude takes your attention inside

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:20.861
because outside it is let alone , to the dogs;

00:16:21.125 --> 00:16:22.791
let alone

00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:26.301
We are not bothered about the outside part.

00:16:26.630 --> 00:16:31.035
“As you keep me, I will be, in that manner”.

00:16:31.605 --> 00:16:36.970
And you will be surprised everything clicks out very well.

00:16:37.725 --> 00:16:40.660
Even, sometimes, you might feel:

00:16:40.930 --> 00:16:42.440
“I should reach a certain place”,

00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:45.360
“I must have this bhajan done”,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:46.950
“I must get these things done”

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:49.120
and it’s not done sometimes.

00:16:50.035 --> 00:16:56.600
Sometimes by mistake something as you want is not done.

00:16:57.090 --> 00:17:01.545
You must accept it as the will of God.

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:08.585
That is what He desires. It’s alright.

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:10.685
That is the desire of God

00:17:10.885 --> 00:17:13.620
and now you are one with His desire.

00:17:14.095 --> 00:17:18.830
You are here to communicate the desire of God to the whole world

00:17:19.080 --> 00:17:20.490
and, at this stage

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:24.000
if you start having your own desires

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:27.095
and ideas about yourself

00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:33.990
then, when will you become the desire of God?

00:17:38.085 --> 00:17:41.805
This ‘I-ness’ has to go away.

00:17:42.655 --> 00:17:45.405
That is what meditation is.

00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:51.525
Where you are no more ‘I’ but it is ‘You’.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:55.155
Kabirdasji has written a beautiful poem about it

00:17:55.500 --> 00:18:01.425
that, when the goat is living and [kicking?],

00:18:01.625 --> 00:18:04.710
she says: “Mai, mai”, that is “I, I”.

00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:09.745
But then she dies

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:15.955
and her intestines are drawn out into wires

00:18:16.675 --> 00:18:21.090
and some saint fixes them on the “tutari”,

00:18:21.290 --> 00:18:23.110
that instrument that they have

00:18:23.325 --> 00:18:25.110
ektari [one string] as they call it.

00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:28.630
And he goes on pulling it with his fingers

00:18:28.985 --> 00:18:33.080
then it says: “Tuhi, Tuhi, Tuhi,”

00:18:34.015 --> 00:18:37.415
that is: “You are, You are, You are”.

00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.665
That is how we have to die

00:18:41.990 --> 00:18:44.710
and we have to be resurrected.

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:47.835
You have been already

00:18:48.325 --> 00:18:51.635
but Sahaja yoga as I have told you

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:55.365
is a kheer [Indian milk sweet],

00:18:55.565 --> 00:18:56.175
or what you call

00:18:56.375 --> 00:19:01.200
the sweet dish cooked in a raw pot:

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.725
“Kachche ghade ki kheer hai [kheer cooked in clay pot].

00:19:03.925 --> 00:19:10.945
So the soil of the raw pot also is mixed up.

00:19:11.495 --> 00:19:17.540
But your attention can be with the kheer, with the milk

00:19:18.365 --> 00:19:25.465
and can drop out all that is the mud of the raw pot.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.320
That discrimination is spontaneous.

00:19:29.525 --> 00:19:31.280
It is there.

00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:35.330
You have got it: self-actualisation.

00:19:35.530 --> 00:19:36.780
You can feel yourself.

00:19:36.980 --> 00:19:38.520
You know you are not that.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:43.880
You have started talking about your chakras in the same manner.

00:19:44.595 --> 00:19:47.315
But the only thing

00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:50.645
the only problem, or the only defect

00:19:51.025 --> 00:19:53.475
that is with the Sahaja yogi is

00:19:53.775 --> 00:19:57.820
that, still, though he is there

00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.395
his attention is involved with outside.

00:20:04.375 --> 00:20:07.960
That’s the only defect.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:10.550
If the attention is removed…

00:20:10.835 --> 00:20:13.125
how to remove? That’s the point.

00:20:13.515 --> 00:20:14.690
That is the first thing.

00:20:14.890 --> 00:20:15.990
Once you say, “how to remove?”

00:20:16.190 --> 00:20:20.705
means you have created the three-dimensional involvement.

00:20:21.245 --> 00:20:27.500
You are not to remove. It is [already] there!

00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:33.750
If your attention is outside

00:20:35.695 --> 00:20:38.035
then I would have said: “No, your attention has to go inside

00:20:38.235 --> 00:20:39.635
It has not got yet.”

00:20:39.835 --> 00:20:41.525
But it is there. You are sitting there.

00:20:41.725 --> 00:20:43.010
I am sitting here.

00:20:43.390 --> 00:20:46.300
But my attention is outside.

00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:51.180
I have to just feel myself where I am, that’s all.

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:53.960
Some have felt it

00:20:54.165 --> 00:20:55.960
some have achieved it.

00:20:56.175 --> 00:20:57.655
You know among yourselves

00:20:57.855 --> 00:21:02.420
there are some who have gone very high up.

00:21:03.445 --> 00:21:07.325
The other method we employ is of puja.

00:21:07.810 --> 00:21:11.205
I’ve found that works very well with human beings – puja –

00:21:11.695 --> 00:21:19.015
because it satisfies lots of demands of the past habits

00:21:20.255 --> 00:21:24.525
that you feel that you are doing something about it.

00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:33.940
Then you start giving whatever you think God has given you – the blessings.

00:21:34.365 --> 00:21:36.470
And the Rishi and Muni have found out

00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:38.980
they’re very clever people

00:21:39.425 --> 00:21:43.250
they have found out how to please the Deities

00:21:43.450 --> 00:21:45.151
how to please the Mother.

00:21:45.555 --> 00:21:46.535
So they have told you

00:21:46.735 --> 00:21:50.815
as they have told you even in this lifetime of mine

00:21:51.015 --> 00:21:52.600
how to please Her.

00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:54.665
They say She is Stutipriya

00:21:54.865 --> 00:21:56.600
that means ‘She likes praises’.

00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:57.780
It’s not that.

00:21:57.980 --> 00:22:03.390
But when you praise someone from the heart

00:22:03.590 --> 00:22:06.955
that means you are accepting it

00:22:07.510 --> 00:22:14.885
and that is the time the chakras start creating a force by which you are thrown

00:22:15.095 --> 00:22:22.200
you are triggered, into that realm of God.

00:22:23.085 --> 00:22:29.425
So these puja methods and prayer methods and the mantra methods

00:22:29.810 --> 00:22:35.120
have been devised and found out by great thinkers of Sahaja Yoga

00:22:35.495 --> 00:22:38.385
the great masters of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:38.625 --> 00:22:42.765
And it is the effort

00:22:42.965 --> 00:22:45.870
or you can say the effortless effort

00:22:46.175 --> 00:22:54.810
of the Sahaja yogis that makes my body vibrate

00:22:55.260 --> 00:23:00.100
extracts the essence from my body, I should say.

00:23:00.350 --> 00:23:06.130
They make, it makes, the Infinite release Itself through this finite being.

00:23:07.055 --> 00:23:10.710
And it works, it clicks, I have seen it, it works out very well.

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.280
But you know that, after puja

00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:15.340
I get little tired

00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:19.925
because, if you cannot receive it, that Force

00:23:20.330 --> 00:23:21.815
I want to sleep

00:23:22.015 --> 00:23:35.050
and get rid of that additional vibrations into “sushupti” [deep sleep] by entering into the Infinite State.

00:23:35.565 --> 00:23:38.545
If you could receive whatever I am emitting

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.865
in balance, with your puja

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.065
then only it helps better.

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:52.130
That means, when you are doing puja also, receive it.

00:23:52.650 --> 00:23:55.495
Be in thoughtless awareness when you are doing puja

00:23:55.790 --> 00:24:00.135
completely concentrated in receiving.

00:24:00.335 --> 00:24:03.120
But while [doing] puja people are talking.

00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:07.095
I’ve seen that they’re moving about. I mean, I don’t know how to explain it!

00:24:07.515 --> 00:24:10.515
That’s the time something is oozing out, the nectar

00:24:10.855 --> 00:24:14.380
and you just receive it at that time with full devotion.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.935
It is oozing out.

00:24:16.135 --> 00:24:19.285
If you feel my vibrations of my chakras at that time

00:24:19.485 --> 00:24:20.985
you will realise

00:24:21.265 --> 00:24:24.175
that even the minute, small little

00:24:24.450 --> 00:24:28.785
wheels in my body are moving at different spaces

00:24:29.295 --> 00:24:32.375
at different speed

00:24:32.655 --> 00:24:35.965
at different dimension.

00:24:36.335 --> 00:24:40.515
And I really don’t know how to explain! But, you see, it creates a melody.

00:24:41.405 --> 00:24:46.910
You have to receive it and it is a melody individually

00:24:47.605 --> 00:24:50.445
suitable for every individual.

00:24:51.030 --> 00:24:53.765
And when you receive it

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.160
it triggers in you that state of infinity.

00:25:00.065 --> 00:25:02.520
So at the time of puja

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:09.800
you must know that all your attention should be in reception.

00:25:11.135 --> 00:25:15.970
Today is a very great day with the New Year.

00:25:16.465 --> 00:25:19.390
Within two years from today

00:25:20.135 --> 00:25:23.855
Satya Yuga is going to start.

00:25:25.435 --> 00:25:29.315
It’s a great day for many things

00:25:29.545 --> 00:25:33.485
that nine days are celebrated after this

00:25:33.685 --> 00:25:36.920
for the advent of Mother.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.080
It is the date

00:25:43.610 --> 00:25:48.410
or I should say, the calendar was started by my forefathers

00:25:49.350 --> 00:25:52.585
and they perceived

00:25:52.965 --> 00:25:58.255
that this is the day when the Mother started creating.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.565
And this is the day She created Ganesha to begin with.

00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:04.615
In the Utpatti stage [first stage, Genesis],

00:26:04.815 --> 00:26:10.175
She started her work this day.

00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:20.020
And that’s why they put this date as the first date

00:26:20.645 --> 00:26:27.545
because the time started from this date long time back.

00:26:28.810 --> 00:26:31.405
And that’s why this date is very important

00:26:31.785 --> 00:26:37.540
and if you cross this date then you are beyond time.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:43.905
You have to step on to this date and go beyond.

00:26:44.435 --> 00:26:47.090
You have to step on your dharma

00:26:47.375 --> 00:26:52.110
on to your religion, and go beyond : ‘dharmateet’.

00:26:52.860 --> 00:26:58.265
You have to be those three gunas

00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.680
and to go beyond : ‘gunateet’.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.710
You are all those three.

00:27:06.465 --> 00:27:10.920
But the steps on which you are standing have to be all right

00:27:11.450 --> 00:27:14.695
or those which are crossed or, have to be all right too.

00:27:15.085 --> 00:27:16.640
So when you are beyond

00:27:16.840 --> 00:27:22.430
you have to repair those steps, which you have crossed somehow

00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:29.865
which can be done through meditation, puja, prayers.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.150
But the most important

00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.115
the greatest advancement is done

00:27:36.315 --> 00:27:43.100
by giving the universal through your universal being.

00:27:44.585 --> 00:27:48.385
You all must dedicate your life to Sahaja Yoga

00:27:48.935 --> 00:27:50.280
and give more and more.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:52.420
Among us there are some people

00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.500
who have given a lot

00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:00.300
and by that they have achieved a lot too.

00:28:01.215 --> 00:28:04.460
You have to give, talk about it, spread it

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:08.345
and bring more people to get this.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:13.450
Otherwise they will be left out of evolutionary processes.

00:28:13.975 --> 00:28:16.565
There’s no time for you to doubt and think;

00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:20.535
don’t waste your time in all these useless activities.

00:28:20.915 --> 00:28:25.210
If you have still doubts, it’s better to give up.

00:28:25.890 --> 00:28:33.635
It’s high time that you get into the process.

00:28:35.945 --> 00:28:51.240
So today I wish you happy New Year for a journey in the spiritual life of this world.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:55.170
You have to think of all the Sahaja Yogis

00:28:55.745 --> 00:29:02.105
who are far away from us

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:10.940
and our thoughts should carry our love for them

00:29:11.315 --> 00:29:19.525
and they should be blessed as you all are blessed here.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.280
I hope these important days that I am here

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:26.545
you will fully dedicate yourself

00:29:27.045 --> 00:29:32.205
for your emancipation on those four lines

00:29:32.490 --> 00:29:34.200
that I have told you.

00:29:34.740 --> 00:29:38.285
And whatever program comes in, take it sahaj.

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.660
You should not insist on times and timings.

00:29:42.860 --> 00:29:45.700
Whatever comes sahaaj, accept it.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.670
May God bless you.
