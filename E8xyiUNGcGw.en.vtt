00:00:04.392 --> 00:00:14.475
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna.

00:00:38.599 --> 00:00:45.766
As you know Shri Krishna is the incarnation of Vishnu.

00:00:49.392 --> 00:00:59.267
And Vishnu is the one who is the preserver of this universe.

00:01:00.225 --> 00:01:04.559
When this whole world was created

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.891
it was necessary

00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:19.392
to create a preserver also

00:01:19.766 --> 00:01:22.766
because this world would have been destroyed

00:01:23.267 --> 00:01:28.683
and completely if it is left alone without a preserver,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.517
then the way human beings are,

00:01:36.267 --> 00:01:38.933
they could have done anything to this world.

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:41.766
But so, Vishnu is the preserver.

00:01:43.142 --> 00:01:47.683
He's the preserver and He's the only one really incarnates.

00:01:47.933 --> 00:01:49.475
Of course,

00:01:50.267 --> 00:01:53.017
sometimes Brahmadeva also incarnated,

00:01:53.475 --> 00:01:55.392
but He only takes forms.

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:59.599
In our evolutionary process He has taken different forms.

00:02:01.142 --> 00:02:04.850
He came on this earth in different ways.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.725
But still He had, as you say,

00:02:10.142 --> 00:02:11.517
twelve

00:02:17.683 --> 00:02:26.600
up to twelve was Shri Rama and up through ten He was there.

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:39.392
So He created also an atmosphere of the many great prophets

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:46.058
around Himself so that they could preserve the dharma

00:02:47.017 --> 00:02:49.058
of this universe.

00:02:50.017 --> 00:02:56.600
So the basis of preservation was dharma,

00:02:57.683 --> 00:02:59.850
which has got, as you know,

00:03:01.183 --> 00:03:10.599
the most important basic foundation for spiritual life.

00:03:12.683 --> 00:03:17.058
In this dharma whatever was to be established

00:03:17.309 --> 00:03:19.392
was to be established balance.

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:23.725
Was a habit with people to go to extremes in anything.

00:03:27.183 --> 00:03:30.267
So He created a balance within us.

00:03:30.933 --> 00:03:36.142
The first principal of dharma was to create balance.

00:03:36.434 --> 00:03:39.017
If a person doesn't have a balance

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:44.058
then he cannot achieve his ascent.

00:03:44.683 --> 00:03:45.683
As simple as that.

00:03:46.517 --> 00:03:50.434
If you don't have a balance in your airplane it cannot ascend.

00:03:50.808 --> 00:03:54.933
If you don't have a balance, say on a ship, it won't move.

00:03:57.434 --> 00:03:59.267
In the same way,

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:03.475
first the human beings had to achieve the balance.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:08.267
But they are born with different capacities,

00:04:08.517 --> 00:04:10.850
with different capabilities.

00:04:12.183 --> 00:04:16.683
As said that, "Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu Jhati rupena samstita",

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:19.434
means the aptitudes are different.

00:04:20.017 --> 00:04:22.058
They are born with different aptitudes,

00:04:22.309 --> 00:04:24.142
with different faces, with different colors,

00:04:25.808 --> 00:04:28.309
because variety was to be created.

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.267
If everybody looked the same, you see they would be looking

00:04:32.599 --> 00:04:35.142
like some robots or something.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.850
So everybody was created in a different way,

00:04:40.183 --> 00:04:41.599
according to the country,

00:04:42.183 --> 00:04:44.058
according to the parents.

00:04:45.392 --> 00:04:52.517
All this was organized by the principal of Shri Vishnu,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.309
that He created this world in different varieties.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.517
He gave variety, and Shri Krishna is the master of it.

00:05:08.933 --> 00:05:12.475
At the time when Shri Krishna came,

00:05:13.142 --> 00:05:15.808
people were extremely serious type

00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:18.683
and had become very ritualistic.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:26.392
The reason was that Rama came and He talked of maryadas,

00:05:27.392 --> 00:05:29.850
and these maryadas made people extremely,

00:05:30.183 --> 00:05:32.309
extremely austere type.

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.392
In that austerity people lost the sense of joy,

00:05:40.725 --> 00:05:43.808
sense of beauty, sense of variety.

00:05:45.309 --> 00:05:47.683
So the Shri Krishna's incarnation

00:05:48.058 --> 00:05:50.434
came as we call it the Sampurna,

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.267
it's complete because He has 16 petals.

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:59.933
As the moon has 16 kalas He too had 16 petals

00:06:00.267 --> 00:06:06.850
so He's Sampurna and He is what we call is the Purnima,

00:06:06.850 --> 00:06:08.641
is the full moon.

00:06:12.309 --> 00:06:18.725
With this completeness of His incarnation,

00:06:18.975 --> 00:06:25.975
of Vishnu's incarnation from Vishnu to many other incarnations

00:06:27.309 --> 00:06:30.933
He came as the complete incarnation;

00:06:31.933 --> 00:06:37.267
the total of Shri Vishnu was manifested.

00:06:38.559 --> 00:06:45.517
So whatever was lacking in Rama's incarnation,

00:06:46.683 --> 00:06:48.392
He brought it forth.

00:06:49.058 --> 00:06:51.975
As you know that on the center - on the right heart

00:06:51.975 --> 00:06:53.975
you have twelve petals.

00:06:56.434 --> 00:07:00.309
With this He showed so many things

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:03.434
which people miss completely,

00:07:03.933 --> 00:07:09.058
because, unfortunately, Gita was written down.

00:07:10.641 --> 00:07:12.559
When Gita was written down,

00:07:15.058 --> 00:07:19.267
people started following the book word by word, not understanding.

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:26.309
And in the Gita His message was never for peace.

00:07:26.683 --> 00:07:28.267
He didn't say you should be peaceful.

00:07:28.517 --> 00:07:30.392
It was something like Jihad.

00:07:30.933 --> 00:07:35.933
That He said that to Arjuna, "You have to fight.

00:07:37.517 --> 00:07:40.434
At this time you have to fight for dharma,

00:07:40.808 --> 00:07:43.933
for the truth and you have to fight."

00:07:44.725 --> 00:07:46.683
Then He said, "I can't kill my uncles

00:07:46.975 --> 00:07:50.641
and I can't kill my grandfather and I can't kill my relations."

00:07:51.517 --> 00:07:56.058
He said, "Who, who are you killing, they're already dead."

00:07:57.267 --> 00:07:59.183
Because they have no dharma.

00:07:59.641 --> 00:08:02.559
If you have no dharma then you are already dead.

00:08:03.309 --> 00:08:05.392
So what is there to kill or not to kill

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.434
and that is what today we see in modern times,

00:08:10.434 --> 00:08:15.309
especially America which is the country of Vishuddhi.

00:08:15.975 --> 00:08:19.309
They have no dharma so they're already dead

00:08:19.975 --> 00:08:22.309
under dope or whatever you may call it,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.517
under fear of all kinds of diseases.

00:08:26.392 --> 00:08:30.183
They are already dead and whom are you going to kill?

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:38.975
And this message was in Kurukshetra He gave to Arjuna.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:46.392
But then he said, "You have asked me to kill these people

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:51.975
because I have Dharma in me. I am killing them, alright,

00:08:52.267 --> 00:08:55.725
but what beyond this?"

00:08:56.183 --> 00:08:57.683
What is beyond that?

00:08:58.725 --> 00:09:01.100
So He describes Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:05.975
Beyond this was Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:06.392 --> 00:09:09.058
Was, first He describes in the second chapter

00:09:09.559 --> 00:09:12.058
who is the Stitha Pragya,

00:09:12.850 --> 00:09:16.600
is the man who is balanced.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:23.683
Then he says that such a man is never angry.

00:09:25.058 --> 00:09:26.683
He doesn't get angry.

00:09:26.933 --> 00:09:30.058
Inside he is absolutely at peace.

00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:35.559
So what He described later on is really the modern times,

00:09:36.683 --> 00:09:39.392
or we can say our Sahaja Yoga

00:09:39.808 --> 00:09:44.517
in which He said how a person should become.

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:50.434
He didn't write, or He didn't say how to become that,

00:09:51.225 --> 00:09:55.891
but the description is just like Christ I think where He says that

00:09:56.641 --> 00:10:00.100
if you somebody slaps you on one face you put the

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:03.183
other side of the face.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:07.475
All this is actually description of Sahaja Yogis

00:10:09.017 --> 00:10:10.766
of the future.

00:10:10.766 --> 00:10:15.891
Not at that time when Khauravas were fighting the Pandavas.

00:10:15.891 --> 00:10:17.600
It was not at that time.

00:10:23.392 --> 00:10:25.766
During that fight He told him

00:10:26.058 --> 00:10:33.267
that if you become a Stitha Pragya then you can transcend

00:10:33.808 --> 00:10:35.600
all these problems,

00:10:36.933 --> 00:10:40.142
all these understandings that you have,

00:10:40.599 --> 00:10:43.933
and you become absolutely peaceful with yourself.

00:10:46.267 --> 00:10:50.392
So on one side He said you have to fight.

00:10:51.017 --> 00:10:54.808
Now in modern times we do not have to fight Kauravas,

00:10:55.058 --> 00:10:56.725
there are no Kauravas

00:10:57.683 --> 00:11:00.933
The five Pandavas have to fight the Khauravas.

00:11:02.267 --> 00:11:06.017
So now what are these five Pandavas?

00:11:06.725 --> 00:11:08.975
They are our senses

00:11:09.309 --> 00:11:13.600
or we can call they are the cosmos,

00:11:15.517 --> 00:11:19.641
divided into various elements.

00:11:20.142 --> 00:11:23.725
One side. They have to fight,

00:11:24.309 --> 00:11:27.600
they have to fight the Kauravas

00:11:27.891 --> 00:11:29.725
which are within us.

00:11:30.267 --> 00:11:33.599
Now there are hundred Kauravas, not one.

00:11:34.808 --> 00:11:38.183
It is, if you extend it

00:11:38.517 --> 00:11:42.683
then we can say the nature has to fight

00:11:43.309 --> 00:11:46.683
something that is against the nature.

00:11:47.725 --> 00:11:50.309
Now people will say anger is natural,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.309
getting annoyed is natural,

00:11:54.559 --> 00:11:56.225
to be aggressive is natural.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.641
It is not.

00:12:00.599 --> 00:12:05.725
Anger and all these things may have been natural,

00:12:06.975 --> 00:12:16.183
but now we must know that we have the natural capacity to ascend.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.183
Is natural to go higher.

00:12:20.641 --> 00:12:24.434
It is natural to be Stitha pragya.

00:12:24.891 --> 00:12:27.600
It is natural to be Sahaja Yogi.

00:12:29.017 --> 00:12:31.100
This is also built in us, in us.

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:33.309
For example a seed is a seed.

00:12:34.225 --> 00:12:36.183
When it is seed we call it seed.

00:12:36.183 --> 00:12:38.350
Alright, naturally is to be seed,

00:12:38.725 --> 00:12:41.975
but then it sprouts and becomes the tree.

00:12:42.641 --> 00:12:45.725
So it is also natural in a seed

00:12:46.766 --> 00:12:50.975
that all that future,

00:12:51.475 --> 00:12:53.225
all the thousands of trees

00:12:53.517 --> 00:12:56.725
it is going to be is also in that seed.

00:12:56.975 --> 00:12:59.350
And now as you know they're experimenting that

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.766
in one seed you can get thousand

00:13:02.309 --> 00:13:07.975
minimum of thousands of little, little sprouts in one seed

00:13:07.975 --> 00:13:12.350
and which can be made all of them into trees or plants.

00:13:13.225 --> 00:13:15.183
This is a new thing that has come up.

00:13:16.225 --> 00:13:20.475
So when He said that

00:13:20.475 --> 00:13:22.850
you have to become a Stitha pragya

00:13:23.183 --> 00:13:27.766
what He was trying to say that you should achieve your balance.

00:13:28.309 --> 00:13:29.975
Now this He told,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.183
there was a war on.

00:13:33.891 --> 00:13:36.225
When they were warring,

00:13:36.766 --> 00:13:38.766
alright, you have to do it.

00:13:39.100 --> 00:13:41.559
If you have to war with people,

00:13:41.766 --> 00:13:43.559
if you have to kill them it's all right.

00:13:45.350 --> 00:13:47.183
But afterwards,

00:13:48.850 --> 00:13:50.434
once that is over

00:13:50.725 --> 00:13:54.641
then what you have to do is to build up your spiritual sense.

00:13:59.475 --> 00:14:02.225
Now the building up of the spiritual sense

00:14:03.225 --> 00:14:07.350
is our work and that's what we have to do.

00:14:11.058 --> 00:14:12.891
Not only dharma.

00:14:12.891 --> 00:14:17.183
Many Sahaja Yogis think that they are going in dharma

00:14:17.475 --> 00:14:18.975
so they are alright.

00:14:19.517 --> 00:14:21.183
They are working in dharma,

00:14:21.559 --> 00:14:23.309
they are living in a dharmic life.

00:14:23.309 --> 00:14:27.517
They are. I'm very surprised and happy that they are doing it.

00:14:28.517 --> 00:14:30.600
But that's not the end of it.

00:14:30.891 --> 00:14:32.600
That's the balance part

00:14:33.183 --> 00:14:35.225
where you are balancing yourself.

00:14:36.058 --> 00:14:39.058
Now, what you have to do is to go ahead

00:14:39.434 --> 00:14:42.891
and build up your spiritual self and spread it.

00:14:43.725 --> 00:14:45.766
This is the work of Shri Krishna also

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:50.725
because He's the one who communicates all over.

00:14:50.975 --> 00:14:53.766
As you know America is communicating everywhere

00:14:54.183 --> 00:14:55.641
in a wrong way - but it is.

00:14:56.891 --> 00:14:58.100
It has got computers,

00:14:58.100 --> 00:14:59.350
it has got this,

00:14:59.641 --> 00:15:01.725
all communication things it has done

00:15:01.725 --> 00:15:05.725
because it is innately built in them to communicate.

00:15:08.058 --> 00:15:11.517
But because they don't believe in Shri Krishna,

00:15:11.766 --> 00:15:13.309
neither in dharma,

00:15:14.225 --> 00:15:16.517
so the basis itself is wrong,

00:15:17.309 --> 00:15:21.517
and with this wrong basis they have started spreading.

00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:24.225
With this very, very wrong basis

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.725
they have started spreading ah,

00:15:29.058 --> 00:15:33.100
all kinds of filth and dirt and I don't know what to call it,

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:36.309
which is against human beings,

00:15:36.766 --> 00:15:38.600
which is against our ascent,

00:15:38.975 --> 00:15:40.766
which is against God.

00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:43.017
And they are doing all this.

00:15:44.058 --> 00:15:45.309
Why?

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:49.600
Why are they doing which they are not supposed to do?

00:15:55.559 --> 00:15:57.142
I think is the intellect.

00:15:58.641 --> 00:16:01.641
Their intellect which is also,

00:16:02.183 --> 00:16:08.434
I should say is the brain, which is the seat of Virat.

00:16:08.725 --> 00:16:11.017
Can you imagine? Is the seat of Virat.

00:16:11.725 --> 00:16:15.225
And with their intellect, what do they do?

00:16:16.641 --> 00:16:18.434
They say it is natural.

00:16:18.975 --> 00:16:21.142
It is natural to be adharmic.

00:16:22.309 --> 00:16:27.475
It is natural to be aggressive.

00:16:28.183 --> 00:16:30.641
It is natural to be money oriented.

00:16:31.641 --> 00:16:34.891
Everything that they have is all natural

00:16:35.725 --> 00:16:37.599
because according to them

00:16:38.475 --> 00:16:44.559
with their intellect they have somehow or other managed

00:16:44.975 --> 00:16:48.725
to convince through your rationality

00:16:49.766 --> 00:16:51.891
that this is the correct thing to do.

00:16:52.559 --> 00:16:54.641
Without this you cannot exist.

00:16:55.475 --> 00:16:58.891
I mean this is supposed to be their culture now.

00:16:59.225 --> 00:17:01.599
Now if that is the culture all over,

00:17:01.850 --> 00:17:03.225
it's not only in America all over,

00:17:03.225 --> 00:17:05.183
this sort of a nonsensical culture

00:17:05.475 --> 00:17:08.434
is accepted because of the intellect.

00:17:09.183 --> 00:17:10.725
They are much more intelligent.

00:17:10.975 --> 00:17:14.100
You see a person who always thinks of money, this, that,

00:17:14.434 --> 00:17:15.766
naturally becomes very intelligent

00:17:15.766 --> 00:17:17.975
in the sense he becomes sharp.

00:17:18.975 --> 00:17:20.309
He becomes smart.

00:17:20.641 --> 00:17:23.434
He becomes smart, smart in a way,

00:17:23.641 --> 00:17:26.100
something as if he knows everything.

00:17:26.475 --> 00:17:28.475
He starts thinking he knows everything,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.475
whatever he's doing he is right,

00:17:30.766 --> 00:17:32.975
whatever the way he is behaving he is right.

00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:37.891
So, these Pandavas which he has got within himself,

00:17:38.475 --> 00:17:40.725
these elements that he has got,

00:17:41.434 --> 00:17:43.559
he uses them for a purpose

00:17:46.225 --> 00:17:48.309
which is destructive,

00:17:48.559 --> 00:17:51.350
absolutely destructive - anti God.

00:17:51.975 --> 00:17:53.559
And he is not aware

00:17:53.891 --> 00:17:56.766
because his intelligence always justifies.

00:17:57.225 --> 00:17:59.975
Whatever he's doing is justified.

00:18:00.225 --> 00:18:08.225
And He has given also so much of brains to these intellectuals

00:18:08.766 --> 00:18:13.309
that they also try to go against what is dharma.

00:18:15.683 --> 00:18:18.017
For example, even Shri Krishna's life

00:18:19.599 --> 00:18:21.559
they try to depict by saying

00:18:22.766 --> 00:18:25.683
that Shri Krishna Himself had five wives

00:18:26.142 --> 00:18:28.434
and He had sixteen wives later on.

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:30.766
Actually these were His power.

00:18:33.891 --> 00:18:36.599
But without understanding what Shri Krishna was,

00:18:36.599 --> 00:18:39.350
because intellect is such a gross nonsense

00:18:39.891 --> 00:18:43.766
that it doesn't take you to the right thinking;

00:18:44.100 --> 00:18:46.017
always to the wrong thinking,

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:49.309
it moves you because you want to justify

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:52.559
everything and this justification

00:18:53.475 --> 00:18:56.142
makes you live with yourself.

00:18:56.641 --> 00:18:58.100
Otherwise, normally,

00:18:58.475 --> 00:19:00.142
you can't live with yourself.

00:19:01.599 --> 00:19:04.267
It is very difficult to live

00:19:04.683 --> 00:19:06.350
with a life which is adharmic,

00:19:06.599 --> 00:19:07.641
which is aggressive,

00:19:07.933 --> 00:19:10.058
which is, what you can call,

00:19:10.475 --> 00:19:12.392
a war mongering type.

00:19:13.058 --> 00:19:14.350
But they live.

00:19:14.641 --> 00:19:18.850
So, all that is expected of a human being,

00:19:19.350 --> 00:19:20.766
just the opposite of that,

00:19:20.766 --> 00:19:22.559
juxtaposition of that,

00:19:22.850 --> 00:19:26.559
is being done in all these western cultures.

00:19:28.058 --> 00:19:31.933
You can see it clearly how they justify.

00:19:32.891 --> 00:19:35.392
Immorality they can justify.

00:19:35.891 --> 00:19:37.641
One Mr. Freud came in.

00:19:38.225 --> 00:19:40.017
He replaced even Christ.

00:19:41.559 --> 00:19:44.766
Of course, I mean, he had to because Christ was even more

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.641
strict than Mohammed sahib

00:19:46.891 --> 00:19:49.808
who said anybody does anything with one eye,

00:19:50.683 --> 00:19:53.267
with the eyes, he should take out one eye,

00:19:54.392 --> 00:19:59.267
and anybody who's hand is spoiling him should,

00:19:59.599 --> 00:20:00.891
he should cut his hand.

00:20:01.142 --> 00:20:03.808
I mean most of the Europeans and Americans

00:20:03.808 --> 00:20:06.225
would have been without one hand I think,

00:20:07.392 --> 00:20:08.766
according to Christ.

00:20:08.766 --> 00:20:11.100
Thank God they didn't follow Him to that point.

00:20:12.017 --> 00:20:15.683
And, also Mohammed sahib thought

00:20:15.683 --> 00:20:18.142
that Christ has done so much for the men,

00:20:18.142 --> 00:20:20.225
why not we do something for the women also,

00:20:20.225 --> 00:20:21.766
so He made something for women.

00:20:22.225 --> 00:20:26.142
Both of them are too much for human beings.

00:20:26.392 --> 00:20:27.683
They didn't realize it.

00:20:28.017 --> 00:20:30.225
Who's going to take out one eye for that?

00:20:31.350 --> 00:20:32.891
They have intellect.

00:20:33.350 --> 00:20:35.808
Now, if they are looking at many women,

00:20:36.475 --> 00:20:39.142
there's a justification - is natural.

00:20:40.933 --> 00:20:43.350
Have you seen any animal behaving like that

00:20:43.350 --> 00:20:45.392
if the animals are natural beings?

00:20:45.808 --> 00:20:47.599
We are worse than animals.

00:20:50.017 --> 00:20:54.559
And what a mess we have created with this kind of understanding

00:20:54.808 --> 00:20:57.267
through these intellectuals

00:20:57.267 --> 00:21:02.808
who are trying to tell us something, and we accept.

00:21:04.017 --> 00:21:06.225
So this is one of the problems

00:21:06.559 --> 00:21:10.559
is if there's an intelligent man, he dominates.

00:21:12.683 --> 00:21:15.891
Now, for example, some fashion starts.

00:21:18.766 --> 00:21:20.267
We all take it.

00:21:20.267 --> 00:21:21.766
It's a fashion.

00:21:21.766 --> 00:21:24.559
But why are you taking it? It's a fashion.

00:21:26.017 --> 00:21:29.225
So, the intellect of an entrepreneur

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:32.017
can really befool you completely.

00:21:33.475 --> 00:21:35.766
But not with people who are wise.

00:21:36.475 --> 00:21:39.267
They will say, "Get lost, we have had all this."

00:21:43.100 --> 00:21:45.599
This is about morality part.

00:21:46.933 --> 00:21:52.142
That is the worst practiced in the West,

00:21:53.017 --> 00:21:55.017
and worse than animals I should say.

00:21:55.392 --> 00:21:57.559
And that's how they are suffering today.

00:21:58.475 --> 00:22:00.392
They are suffering with so many diseases,

00:22:00.392 --> 00:22:02.392
so many troubles, this, that.

00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:07.891
Second thing which we always justify is violence.

00:22:08.309 --> 00:22:11.309
Now there is no war going on in Kurukshetra.

00:22:12.559 --> 00:22:14.475
But you see violence everywhere.

00:22:14.475 --> 00:22:16.309
In America it's terrible.

00:22:16.850 --> 00:22:19.850
When my daughter went she took out all her ornaments,

00:22:19.850 --> 00:22:21.309
put it with Me.

00:22:21.559 --> 00:22:23.641
She said, "Mummy, I can't carry this."

00:22:24.100 --> 00:22:25.850
Nothing was given to the girl.

00:22:26.183 --> 00:22:28.100
All artificial things were given

00:22:28.766 --> 00:22:31.017
because you can be killed for it.

00:22:32.766 --> 00:22:35.725
I'm not saying it's only in America. It's everywhere.

00:22:35.975 --> 00:22:38.350
Because everybody's guru is America.

00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:40.766
It starts from America,

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:44.766
the gurudom and people just follow blindly.

00:22:45.766 --> 00:22:48.309
So the violence is now entering into our films,

00:22:48.599 --> 00:22:52.350
Indian films also, but now they have taken some objection.

00:22:53.599 --> 00:22:56.017
Maybe it is too much for us.

00:22:56.559 --> 00:22:59.017
But this kind of thing that

00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:02.641
you can kill anybody,

00:23:04.017 --> 00:23:05.599
so if you go on like this,

00:23:05.599 --> 00:23:09.641
you see if that is the criteria of greatness

00:23:09.641 --> 00:23:12.267
then Rwanda people should be placed highest

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:14.017
in the evolutionary process.

00:23:15.599 --> 00:23:20.599
Killing somebody is not allowed. Thou shalt not kill.

00:23:23.267 --> 00:23:24.683
Muslims are killing.

00:23:25.350 --> 00:23:27.267
Everbody's killing everyone.

00:23:27.559 --> 00:23:30.017
The other day they killed a very nice man in India

00:23:30.267 --> 00:23:31.766
for nothing at all.

00:23:32.975 --> 00:23:35.725
This idea of aggressiveness

00:23:35.725 --> 00:23:38.434
ultimately takes you to the killing part.

00:23:38.725 --> 00:23:42.392
You can't even create one ant.

00:23:43.933 --> 00:23:46.392
How can you kill human beings like that?

00:23:47.725 --> 00:23:50.434
Of course, this killing business

00:23:50.808 --> 00:23:54.100
is taken to the highest limit,

00:23:54.434 --> 00:23:57.808
like Hitler believed that he was top of the world.

00:23:57.808 --> 00:23:59.641
This is same,

00:24:00.850 --> 00:24:03.683
that you just forget what you are

00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:06.725
and you start assuming through your ego

00:24:06.725 --> 00:24:08.933
that you are something very great.

00:24:11.058 --> 00:24:13.267
Also, in Sahaja Yoga I find recently

00:24:13.517 --> 00:24:15.725
there are some people who are saying they're gods,

00:24:15.975 --> 00:24:18.183
they're deities, everything.

00:24:21.434 --> 00:24:23.600
So this ego business

00:24:23.933 --> 00:24:27.600
is actually taking energy of your intelligence,

00:24:28.058 --> 00:24:30.434
and the greatest enemy of a human being is,

00:24:30.850 --> 00:24:32.808
is his intelligence, I think,

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:34.725
because it's so limited,

00:24:34.975 --> 00:24:36.808
it is so conditioned,

00:24:37.183 --> 00:24:39.100
and it is so arrogant,

00:24:39.434 --> 00:24:41.600
and it is so blind.

00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.392
Wisdom is a different thing.

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:48.725
Wisdom you don't get in colleges,

00:24:48.725 --> 00:24:50.808
schools, universities, nowhere.

00:24:51.434 --> 00:24:53.725
Where do you get it, the wisdom?

00:24:54.392 --> 00:24:56.683
You get it through your Spirit,

00:24:56.975 --> 00:24:59.600
which gives you a complete idea

00:24:59.850 --> 00:25:03.267
as to what is right and what is wrong.

00:25:03.933 --> 00:25:09.100
Whatever is wrong will be accepted by intellect, always.

00:25:09.517 --> 00:25:14.100
Intellect is not wisdom one must understand.

00:25:14.517 --> 00:25:18.392
They're two things - wisdom and intellect.

00:25:19.058 --> 00:25:23.434
Now Krishna was known to be the diplomat.

00:25:23.850 --> 00:25:26.309
He had Divine diplomacy.

00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.183
That means what?

00:25:28.517 --> 00:25:30.183
He was very intelligent,

00:25:30.559 --> 00:25:32.850
no doubt. Without that you can't do.

00:25:33.142 --> 00:25:37.350
I've met some people who are very highly placed

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:39.017
who don't have much intelligence even,

00:25:39.017 --> 00:25:46.267
but I have now seen that this intellect is a dangerous thing.

00:25:47.891 --> 00:25:49.225
So Shri Krishna,

00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:53.808
He used His intellect.

00:25:54.933 --> 00:25:56.599
He is all powerful.

00:25:56.975 --> 00:25:58.350
Nothing can dominate Him.

00:25:58.599 --> 00:26:00.599
Even his intellect cannot dominate Him.

00:26:00.975 --> 00:26:02.599
He used His intellect.

00:26:02.599 --> 00:26:04.891
Difference between the two you should see.

00:26:05.267 --> 00:26:07.975
You should be able to use your intellect

00:26:08.225 --> 00:26:10.475
and not to be dominated by your intellect.

00:26:11.766 --> 00:26:16.475
So He used His intellect by which He solved many problems.

00:26:16.975 --> 00:26:21.599
His whole diplomacy was to use His intellect

00:26:22.559 --> 00:26:25.766
and use it for the purpose of Divine.

00:26:26.142 --> 00:26:28.975
All the time the Divine in Him

00:26:30.017 --> 00:26:32.808
was helping Him to use His intellect.

00:26:33.267 --> 00:26:37.350
So the difference is that we are slaves of our intellect

00:26:38.975 --> 00:26:41.599
and He is the master of His intellect;

00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:44.267
not only, everything.

00:26:45.850 --> 00:26:47.434
His conditioning He is master,

00:26:47.725 --> 00:26:49.142
His emotions He is master,

00:26:50.599 --> 00:26:52.975
His body He's the master.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:55.225
He's master of everything.

00:26:55.850 --> 00:26:59.434
And when you master it you see your intellect very clearly,

00:26:59.434 --> 00:27:02.142
oh, this is what it is suggesting.

00:27:03.599 --> 00:27:04.850
This is not.

00:27:05.100 --> 00:27:08.891
This intellect can give you very so-called positive ideas

00:27:09.142 --> 00:27:11.975
that you are the lord of the whole world.

00:27:12.225 --> 00:27:13.641
It's supposed to be positive.

00:27:13.975 --> 00:27:16.599
Or the same intellect can give you ideas

00:27:17.641 --> 00:27:19.683
that you are nothing.

00:27:21.017 --> 00:27:24.850
This intellect plays on top of you.

00:27:25.683 --> 00:27:29.517
Now you are not to be guided by your intellect,

00:27:29.517 --> 00:27:31.392
but by your wisdom,

00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:33.517
as you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:27:34.267 --> 00:27:37.267
So, you have a very good instrument of feeling it-

00:27:37.267 --> 00:27:39.392
through your vibrations you can make out

00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:41.808
what is good and what is bad.

00:27:43.599 --> 00:27:45.933
And you can see sometimes,

00:27:45.933 --> 00:27:47.267
as being human beings,

00:27:47.267 --> 00:27:51.475
there are some intellectual effects also coming in.

00:27:52.225 --> 00:27:54.517
But with Sahaja Yoga you can judge,

00:27:55.766 --> 00:27:57.600
what is this intellect telling you.

00:27:57.933 --> 00:28:01.475
Because the intellect that you have has come out of what

00:28:01.683 --> 00:28:05.142
is the main thing; should go to the subtle point

00:28:05.392 --> 00:28:08.058
how this intellect has come to us.

00:28:09.891 --> 00:28:15.017
This intellect has come to us because our brain became,

00:28:15.517 --> 00:28:17.599
active very soon.

00:28:18.017 --> 00:28:20.517
I've seen some children extremely intelligent,

00:28:21.267 --> 00:28:22.891
but they have no wisdom.

00:28:26.225 --> 00:28:29.017
If your - only the brain develops too much,

00:28:29.017 --> 00:28:31.392
could be a mother is a very,

00:28:32.683 --> 00:28:34.392
intelligent woman and,

00:28:34.933 --> 00:28:36.683
father must be very intelligent,

00:28:37.058 --> 00:28:38.517
inheritance would be great,

00:28:38.808 --> 00:28:40.183
so they get it.

00:28:40.683 --> 00:28:42.600
Or maybe the circumstances,

00:28:43.017 --> 00:28:45.142
like if you are born in a particular country

00:28:45.142 --> 00:28:47.183
you suddenly become very intelligent.

00:28:48.058 --> 00:28:51.058
I've seen Americans, they read all the time.

00:28:51.058 --> 00:28:52.600
All the time you see them reading.

00:28:52.891 --> 00:28:54.267
Even English they read.

00:28:54.933 --> 00:28:57.683
But what is the outcome of all that reading I don't know.

00:28:59.599 --> 00:29:01.392
Every book they will read.

00:29:01.891 --> 00:29:04.434
If you ask them what is a computer, they know the computers,

00:29:04.434 --> 00:29:06.434
this thing, that thing, that thing, all the. . .

00:29:06.434 --> 00:29:10.434
I don't know how to even put off my television.

00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.100
If you ask them about television they will know they'll . . .

00:29:15.350 --> 00:29:18.891
anything you want to know about mechanical things they will know.

00:29:19.183 --> 00:29:21.058
Anything about politics they will know,

00:29:21.517 --> 00:29:23.641
who's father was that and they will tell you that,

00:29:23.641 --> 00:29:26.183
"No, no, no, no this is like this, this like that."

00:29:26.517 --> 00:29:33.225
All this is avidya; is not knowledge. It is non-knowledge.

00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.725
So they think they're very intelligent

00:29:36.725 --> 00:29:40.434
because they know everything, about everything.

00:29:41.350 --> 00:29:43.100
Now, with this intellect,

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:46.975
as this consciousness comes in they start creating

00:29:47.225 --> 00:29:49.766
very intellectual ideas.

00:29:50.350 --> 00:29:52.309
Especially in America I have seen

00:29:52.559 --> 00:29:54.975
they have got for children

00:29:56.350 --> 00:30:00.725
all kinds of funny things just to extract money.

00:30:00.975 --> 00:30:04.267
For example, there is a golliwog or something

00:30:04.267 --> 00:30:05.559
which has a birthday.

00:30:05.559 --> 00:30:07.267
Can you imagine?

00:30:08.183 --> 00:30:11.183
A birthday is there and sometimes,

00:30:11.183 --> 00:30:17.517
you see even the, people have big parties for that.

00:30:18.599 --> 00:30:22.267
Then they started, let us have birthday of the dogs,

00:30:23.267 --> 00:30:26.142
so they are having birthdays of the dogs.

00:30:27.267 --> 00:30:29.392
Anybody who puts ideas into them.

00:30:29.808 --> 00:30:31.850
Then there are organizations

00:30:32.267 --> 00:30:34.600
where they say, "All right, when you are going to die,

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:37.517
you tell us what suit you want to wear,

00:30:37.517 --> 00:30:41.058
what tie you want to wear, what shoes, what clothes,

00:30:41.058 --> 00:30:42.933
then what, in of,

00:30:42.933 --> 00:30:46.142
what kind of a coffin you want to go - plastic,

00:30:46.142 --> 00:30:48.517
or wood, or this and that." I mean . . .

00:30:49.600 --> 00:30:51.517
So it is to be prescribed

00:30:51.975 --> 00:30:54.183
to such an extent that some people say,

00:30:54.183 --> 00:30:57.058
"Put us in the ice, you see, so we'll be there."

00:30:59.058 --> 00:31:01.434
The worst thing, I think,

00:31:01.933 --> 00:31:03.600
especially in Europe, is

00:31:04.058 --> 00:31:10.434
that they have nicely advertised and marketed

00:31:11.058 --> 00:31:13.600
the thing of going for a holiday.

00:31:15.434 --> 00:31:20.850
So, in Italy supposing a person doesn't go to holiday,

00:31:21.142 --> 00:31:23.434
he'll say, "There's a crisis in my life."

00:31:23.434 --> 00:31:25.600
"What?" "I couldn't go to holiday."

00:31:26.309 --> 00:31:28.183
Then they said you must go there,

00:31:28.434 --> 00:31:29.683
tan your faces,

00:31:30.183 --> 00:31:33.683
stay there in hotels so, so many hotels have come up.

00:31:34.058 --> 00:31:35.933
Everybody has to go out.

00:31:36.267 --> 00:31:37.183
Especially I was surprised

00:31:37.183 --> 00:31:39.808
the whole of Milan is closed for one month.

00:31:40.058 --> 00:31:42.142
Nobody you can find there.

00:31:42.517 --> 00:31:47.599
See, I think if they all go and live in jungles

00:31:47.599 --> 00:31:48.975
would be a better idea.

00:31:49.309 --> 00:31:50.725
They will learn much more

00:31:50.975 --> 00:31:53.142
than to waste their time on the seashore.

00:31:53.392 --> 00:31:55.183
They're spoiling all the seashores.

00:31:55.808 --> 00:31:59.058
They have no respect for the sea which is their Father.

00:31:59.599 --> 00:32:03.142
They have no respect for each other.

00:32:04.142 --> 00:32:07.517
The women try to slim down and to look very nice

00:32:07.517 --> 00:32:09.850
so that they could become nude there.

00:32:10.142 --> 00:32:12.975
The whole industry is so bad.

00:32:13.350 --> 00:32:15.975
I mean if, somebody says would you like to come to the seashore,

00:32:15.975 --> 00:32:17.559
I would not go.

00:32:18.891 --> 00:32:23.475
I would hate to go to a place to see so many stupid ladies

00:32:23.850 --> 00:32:26.641
in the sun busy trying to tan themselves.

00:32:27.058 --> 00:32:31.600
Now this stupid idea how could you accept if you are intelligent?

00:32:37.975 --> 00:32:40.766
There are so many ideas prevalent today,

00:32:41.058 --> 00:32:43.559
mostly coming from America, I must say,

00:32:44.766 --> 00:32:48.725
that you people follow. As I said

00:32:48.975 --> 00:32:51.766
that America is the guru of all the Eastern,

00:32:51.766 --> 00:32:57.559
of all our European and English and all these people.

00:33:00.475 --> 00:33:03.309
Now, then another thing happens.

00:33:03.766 --> 00:33:07.225
You see the atmosphere in which you live.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.975
Especially in England I have noticed.

00:33:10.975 --> 00:33:12.766
They may be nothing, you know.

00:33:13.017 --> 00:33:16.641
There was a garbage cleaner who came to our house

00:33:17.434 --> 00:33:19.850
and we had that time with us a president

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:23.600
of the Hague high court, imagine, the world high court.

00:33:24.225 --> 00:33:27.183
So, I told him, "You have to clear out all these things."

00:33:27.183 --> 00:33:31.600
"It's too much!" As usual, you see they are very,

00:33:32.392 --> 00:33:35.766
I don't know what to say, but, stupidly proud about themselves.

00:33:36.392 --> 00:33:39.517
"You don't understand." I said, "How much do you want?"

00:33:39.517 --> 00:33:40.683
I gave him ten pounds.

00:33:40.683 --> 00:33:42.808
In those days ten pounds was a big thing.

00:33:43.142 --> 00:33:45.142
He said, "You don't understand the laws,

00:33:45.392 --> 00:33:47.600
you see you are all Indians, niggers, this that."

00:33:48.267 --> 00:33:50.808
Then this gentleman who was in our house

00:33:50.808 --> 00:33:52.599
he came out and he asked him,

00:33:52.599 --> 00:33:54.350
"Why are you shouting here?"

00:33:54.350 --> 00:33:56.808
"You nigger, you don't understand any laws."

00:33:57.058 --> 00:34:01.600
He is the chairman of the world high court

00:34:01.891 --> 00:34:04.517
and this stupid Englishman talking like that.

00:34:04.808 --> 00:34:06.808
The English are really, in a way,

00:34:06.808 --> 00:34:08.933
they are really dumb people

00:34:09.475 --> 00:34:11.766
because their intelligence never told,

00:34:12.017 --> 00:34:14.058
tells them that you are nothing.

00:34:14.392 --> 00:34:15.766
What are you proud of?

00:34:17.891 --> 00:34:19.599
Such dumb people they are.

00:34:20.267 --> 00:34:22.183
I don't know it might have come frozen

00:34:22.475 --> 00:34:24.183
with the cold or anything,

00:34:24.517 --> 00:34:26.350
but they think they are very intelligent.

00:34:26.933 --> 00:34:28.683
Their scholarship was all right,

00:34:28.683 --> 00:34:32.017
but I was amazed that in the beginning of the scholarship

00:34:32.017 --> 00:34:33.891
that they had, they said

00:34:34.142 --> 00:34:36.267
that the black people are like beasts.

00:34:38.475 --> 00:34:40.600
There are so many books written about it,

00:34:41.142 --> 00:34:43.392
and they accepted that black people are like beasts

00:34:43.392 --> 00:34:45.350
while these people were living,

00:34:45.683 --> 00:34:47.017
like I don't know what,

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.683
at the time when Black were much more advanced.

00:34:53.933 --> 00:34:57.725
So, this kind of an idea when they have I see here also.

00:34:58.309 --> 00:35:02.142
I can see this that English have,

00:35:02.392 --> 00:35:04.309
they think no end of themselves.

00:35:06.058 --> 00:35:09.392
But they don't understand they don't know anything.

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:11.808
They have no wisdom.

00:35:11.808 --> 00:35:13.683
They lived in India for 300 years.

00:35:13.933 --> 00:35:16.142
They never learned anything from India.

00:35:16.683 --> 00:35:18.600
Can you imagine their wisdom part?

00:35:22.142 --> 00:35:23.599
Their scholarship,

00:35:23.850 --> 00:35:25.017
some of them,

00:35:25.392 --> 00:35:27.017
but still ambiguous.

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.850
Say Bernard Shaw I think was very ambiguous.

00:35:30.142 --> 00:35:32.850
I place him as a very great writer, but ambiguous.

00:35:34.058 --> 00:35:37.600
And then comes the French, God save.

00:35:39.808 --> 00:35:43.058
Now how have they denied Shri Krishna

00:35:43.058 --> 00:35:48.142
you can see very clearly in French people.

00:35:48.933 --> 00:35:53.517
French wanted to become the highest in diplomacy.

00:35:53.808 --> 00:35:56.933
They lack diplomacy completely. Useless people.

00:35:57.808 --> 00:36:00.808
They made our telephone in India the way they have spoiled it.

00:36:01.142 --> 00:36:05.725
So, they started a cult of drinking.

00:36:05.725 --> 00:36:09.309
Now can you imagine Shri Krishna drinking all these things?

00:36:09.599 --> 00:36:12.599
They have a dictionary on drinking on, everything.

00:36:12.599 --> 00:36:14.392
There's books after books written.

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:18.599
I mean you imagine how could any evolved people

00:36:18.808 --> 00:36:21.808
accept this kind of a nonsensical culture

00:36:21.808 --> 00:36:24.058
that you must know what to drink,

00:36:24.058 --> 00:36:25.975
what to buy, what to put in,

00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:29.850
what sort of a tumblers to be put?

00:36:30.517 --> 00:36:33.142
They are all tumblers, nothing but tumblers I think.

00:36:33.683 --> 00:36:36.058
How could they accept such a thing

00:36:37.058 --> 00:36:40.808
which is so stupid, is a social acceptance?

00:36:42.142 --> 00:36:45.392
Prostitution is another social acceptance.

00:36:46.142 --> 00:36:49.933
Morality-wise they have really denied completely

00:36:50.183 --> 00:36:53.183
the principal of Shri Krishna.

00:36:56.808 --> 00:37:00.599
The way they have been ruining their people

00:37:01.683 --> 00:37:05.517
and to beat up everything is racialism.

00:37:08.517 --> 00:37:14.267
Can you think that for the skin you separate people?

00:37:15.599 --> 00:37:17.725
On the contrary I would say the Black,

00:37:18.017 --> 00:37:20.058
especially in India; they're much more evolved

00:37:20.599 --> 00:37:22.599
than all the white skins put together,

00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:25.267
because they have wisdom.

00:37:27.183 --> 00:37:28.808
They are wiser people.

00:37:29.766 --> 00:37:31.309
But these white skins,

00:37:31.766 --> 00:37:34.309
they are going to - I mean,

00:37:34.309 --> 00:37:36.183
how did they get America also?

00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:40.350
They dominated so much, they conquered it,

00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.891
they settled down there.

00:37:41.891 --> 00:37:45.434
You saw yesterday, from Sierra Nevada you saw

00:37:45.434 --> 00:37:48.475
how people believed in wisdom and how they lived.

00:37:48.891 --> 00:37:50.350
They took away all their lands.

00:37:50.350 --> 00:37:55.225
Everybody, you see, is now nicely the owner of America.

00:37:55.891 --> 00:37:58.641
How? You are squatters.

00:37:58.641 --> 00:38:00.058
You came from another country,

00:38:00.309 --> 00:38:01.975
killed thousands and thousands of people

00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:04.600
without feeling guilty about it.

00:38:04.850 --> 00:38:07.225
That means they are not even human beings.

00:38:10.891 --> 00:38:12.975
And nicely settled as Americans.

00:38:17.225 --> 00:38:20.225
I don't know how this word 'America' has come,

00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:24.559
but if it means "amar" they are not.

00:38:24.891 --> 00:38:27.891
It means "a mericas" they are not.

00:38:28.766 --> 00:38:31.350
Both ways I don't know how this word has come

00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:35.017
and some sort of a, uh, meaning they attach to it,

00:38:35.434 --> 00:38:41.434
but their intellect grew much more.

00:38:41.725 --> 00:38:45.434
Why? Again, because of money orientation.

00:38:47.683 --> 00:38:49.600
I don't understand economics

00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:52.267
and the way they have made this economics from their,

00:38:53.142 --> 00:38:55.142
yarns which came out of their heads

00:38:55.434 --> 00:38:57.683
has landed all the countries into recession,

00:38:57.933 --> 00:39:01.517
all kinds of fraud and also mafia.

00:39:01.975 --> 00:39:05.517
That is the outcome of this so-called economics they have.

00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:08.933
Sahaj economics is very different.

00:39:09.517 --> 00:39:14.850
We are not bound by all these nonsensical ideas

00:39:15.183 --> 00:39:18.600
that are prevalent as economics.

00:39:18.933 --> 00:39:21.434
Is nothing but exploitation.

00:39:21.725 --> 00:39:23.434
Is marketing.

00:39:23.434 --> 00:39:25.058
Is how to impress people,

00:39:25.309 --> 00:39:26.434
how to sell things,

00:39:26.434 --> 00:39:28.933
how to do this, how to do that.

00:39:29.267 --> 00:39:32.267
All this is nothing but, I would say,

00:39:32.267 --> 00:39:34.683
financial aggressiveness.

00:39:38.683 --> 00:39:40.725
What about Shri Krishna?

00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:47.599
He was the king and He lived like a king.

00:39:47.933 --> 00:39:51.725
But also, He lived in a very humble abode

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:55.058
in Gokul.

00:39:56.933 --> 00:39:59.017
He was not attached.

00:40:01.392 --> 00:40:06.142
So the first thing is that the way they're attached to money,

00:40:07.309 --> 00:40:12.267
any justification for getting money is all right.

00:40:12.683 --> 00:40:15.683
Once we went to a hotel in India.

00:40:16.766 --> 00:40:19.017
So we had some American friends

00:40:19.599 --> 00:40:22.766
and as usual, I mean, you can't eat like Americans can,

00:40:22.766 --> 00:40:25.142
you know. Is, Indians can't compete.

00:40:25.850 --> 00:40:27.434
Can eat a lot.

00:40:27.683 --> 00:40:29.850
So they were eating, eating, eating and,

00:40:30.100 --> 00:40:32.434
but we couldn't cope with them, really, to be very frank,

00:40:32.434 --> 00:40:34.225
I mean, we're no good.

00:40:34.559 --> 00:40:39.350
After some time they said, "Have you finished?" I said, "Yes."

00:40:39.641 --> 00:40:41.475
"All right..." they called the waiter,

00:40:41.475 --> 00:40:43.766
"Pack this out." I said, "What?

00:40:44.100 --> 00:40:46.975
Want to pack this for what?" "We paid for it."

00:40:47.350 --> 00:40:51.309
"So you paid for it, but I mean...In India nobody will eat a food

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:53.309
which somebody else has eaten."

00:40:53.559 --> 00:40:54.975
"No, you pack it."

00:40:55.225 --> 00:40:57.142
And they had no shame about it;

00:40:57.434 --> 00:40:59.599
so shameless. I said.

00:40:59.599 --> 00:41:01.350
"We don't do this in India."

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:03.475
Said, "Why not?" I said,. "These are bad manners."

00:41:03.475 --> 00:41:05.017
"But we've paid for it.

00:41:05.309 --> 00:41:07.891
Once you've paid for it then there is no bad manners."

00:41:09.850 --> 00:41:12.017
I said, "Ah, we don't want this to pack."

00:41:12.017 --> 00:41:14.017
"We'll have it. We'll have it in the night.

00:41:14.017 --> 00:41:15.766
We'll have it in the evening."

00:41:15.766 --> 00:41:19.100
I was surprised that such miserly people

00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:21.142
are saying that they are very rich

00:41:21.142 --> 00:41:24.475
and they think no end of themselves; extremely miserly.

00:41:24.975 --> 00:41:28.599
Americans are superficially nice, I must tell you.

00:41:29.017 --> 00:41:32.475
On my experience is they are not like English

00:41:32.683 --> 00:41:34.641
that they look down upon everyone.

00:41:34.641 --> 00:41:36.267
No you don't feel that way with them.

00:41:36.599 --> 00:41:40.100
But they are very superficial.

00:41:40.434 --> 00:41:43.475
You give them ten presents; they won't even give you one.

00:41:45.975 --> 00:41:49.309
They have no sense at all; no shame about it.

00:41:49.766 --> 00:41:54.559
Why? Because the whole thing is, 'we paid for it'.

00:41:55.850 --> 00:41:59.475
I mean you go to any place,

00:41:59.475 --> 00:42:03.142
any restaurant there or anything, you'll be amazed.

00:42:04.017 --> 00:42:05.975
They pack things for you

00:42:06.225 --> 00:42:08.309
if something is left over in America.

00:42:08.309 --> 00:42:09.475
They do.

00:42:11.559 --> 00:42:15.017
To that extent they can go in their miserliness

00:42:15.017 --> 00:42:17.475
without any shame about it.

00:42:17.850 --> 00:42:20.267
And miserliness is out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:42:20.975 --> 00:42:22.641
You cannot be miserly.

00:42:23.350 --> 00:42:25.017
You have to be generous.

00:42:25.350 --> 00:42:27.309
You have to be giving.

00:42:27.559 --> 00:42:29.225
You have to feel for others.

00:42:30.142 --> 00:42:33.142
Is this the only way we can express ourselves.

00:42:33.850 --> 00:42:35.225
All this generosity

00:42:35.850 --> 00:42:40.142
is not to create a big sort of a hero out of you.

00:42:42.309 --> 00:42:46.641
But the worst and the worst and the worst is the Hollywood.

00:42:49.599 --> 00:42:53.641
Is the film industry.

00:42:53.891 --> 00:42:57.017
Under the name of industry you can do anything.

00:43:00.100 --> 00:43:05.142
Now this Hollywood is creating such horrible films,

00:43:06.599 --> 00:43:11.641
but the worst is that they get awards for these worst films.

00:43:12.017 --> 00:43:15.725
There's one film they showed, I've not seen, I can't see it.

00:43:16.350 --> 00:43:19.434
They told Me that a man is a cannibal

00:43:19.683 --> 00:43:22.309
and he is eating the flesh of human beings

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:26.017
and they have shown but they enjoy.

00:43:27.891 --> 00:43:30.309
Very, very famous. Apart from that,

00:43:30.850 --> 00:43:33.766
not only famous, but they got awards for the best film,

00:43:34.017 --> 00:43:36.434
the best actor, the best...

00:43:37.766 --> 00:43:39.975
You must get a director from there

00:43:40.225 --> 00:43:42.975
and make him eat the flesh of human beings.

00:43:43.975 --> 00:43:46.434
It's the only way, I think this horrible thing...

00:43:46.725 --> 00:43:48.641
Then they are producing other pictures.

00:43:48.641 --> 00:43:50.891
I've seen another one for a short time

00:43:51.434 --> 00:43:55.017
where they shows all dead bodies hanging you see.

00:43:55.017 --> 00:43:56.475
Horrible!

00:43:59.017 --> 00:44:02.891
Why these people like to see such horrible things?

00:44:04.434 --> 00:44:05.766
What is their character?

00:44:06.683 --> 00:44:08.309
Where have they gone?

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:13.225
Why do they enjoy things which no human being

00:44:13.225 --> 00:44:16.599
who is a human being will enjoy?

00:44:19.225 --> 00:44:21.766
And then it goes further.

00:44:22.017 --> 00:44:24.142
Their halloween business - I saw a film,

00:44:24.434 --> 00:44:27.434
I said, "My God." This is a hell in which

00:44:28.434 --> 00:44:32.100
they thought it was like the wrath of Shri Krishna.

00:44:33.725 --> 00:44:35.641
So it was Krishna consciousness I think

00:44:35.641 --> 00:44:37.350
that was working there.

00:44:38.641 --> 00:44:42.309
There are thousand and one things which can shock you in America,

00:44:42.766 --> 00:44:47.350
and also in England, also in Europe.

00:44:49.975 --> 00:44:52.641
I thought Austria was something better,

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:56.600
but in Austria when you walk on the road

00:44:56.975 --> 00:44:58.850
in the night after the program

00:44:59.350 --> 00:45:02.725
you must take darshan of many horrible women there on the way.

00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.559
I mean this is no where...

00:45:04.559 --> 00:45:07.183
you know they're, we're forced into it.

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.641
And they can't do anything about it

00:45:11.891 --> 00:45:13.725
as if it's a matter of right, you see,

00:45:13.725 --> 00:45:17.017
what you call that of human right

00:45:17.434 --> 00:45:19.183
to see such women,

00:45:19.434 --> 00:45:22.017
and human right for these women to be on the street.

00:45:22.599 --> 00:45:25.599
All horrible things are happening around,

00:45:25.975 --> 00:45:29.183
so Sahaja Yogis have to equip themselves much more

00:45:29.599 --> 00:45:32.183
with a Shri Krishna's principle.

00:45:32.475 --> 00:45:34.891
The first principle is communication.

00:45:36.766 --> 00:45:40.100
First principle is how you communicate with others.

00:45:40.434 --> 00:45:43.100
Start it at home with your children,

00:45:43.350 --> 00:45:45.350
with your wife, with your husband,

00:45:45.641 --> 00:45:47.641
how you communicate.

00:45:48.475 --> 00:45:49.725
Are you gentle?

00:45:49.975 --> 00:45:51.434
Are you kind?

00:45:51.850 --> 00:45:56.434
Are you dominating, aggressive?

00:45:56.766 --> 00:45:58.891
Just try to find out.

00:46:01.475 --> 00:46:04.475
It can go to any limit this aggressiveness,

00:46:04.850 --> 00:46:06.725
either of the women or of the men.

00:46:06.725 --> 00:46:10.225
Here more women I must say, I'm sorry to say.

00:46:10.766 --> 00:46:13.725
But in my experience I've seen the women are very dominating.

00:46:14.309 --> 00:46:16.475
In India men are extremely dominating,

00:46:16.725 --> 00:46:19.641
but here I find the women are.

00:46:24.559 --> 00:46:27.434
Now the basics

00:46:29.434 --> 00:46:33.725
as human beings should have good manners.

00:46:36.766 --> 00:46:38.475
I don't find good manners,

00:46:38.475 --> 00:46:41.850
except that they wear good dresses, maybe the...

00:46:42.183 --> 00:46:46.100
they might be wearing those special type of dresses and all that.

00:46:46.350 --> 00:46:48.850
All manners are in dresses,

00:46:50.183 --> 00:46:54.309
but when there are people together

00:46:54.600 --> 00:46:57.183
they talk nothing but scandal.

00:46:59.475 --> 00:47:03.434
I mean, unbearably, horrible scandals they discuss.

00:47:05.641 --> 00:47:09.100
This is something one has to understand

00:47:09.350 --> 00:47:14.058
that Shri Krishna never talked of scandals.

00:47:16.100 --> 00:47:19.017
How can this, the country of Shri Krishna

00:47:19.475 --> 00:47:21.725
and all other these European countries

00:47:22.017 --> 00:47:28.350
are just very equipped with all the scandals of the world?

00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.183
I just can't understand what is the interest

00:47:33.559 --> 00:47:35.309
people have in the scandals.

00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:39.017
So to top it all is your media

00:47:39.017 --> 00:47:42.475
which is absolutely anti Shri Krishna

00:47:44.891 --> 00:47:47.100
because they have to make money.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.225
It's such a hand in glove business

00:47:49.600 --> 00:47:53.100
that the people like to hear all this nonsense,

00:47:53.850 --> 00:47:56.350
so they have scandals in the newspaper.

00:47:56.891 --> 00:47:58.766
At least about thirty years back

00:47:59.058 --> 00:48:01.600
you could never hear such a thing

00:48:03.891 --> 00:48:07.559
and all such books were completely banned.

00:48:09.225 --> 00:48:13.475
And now, suddenly, the whole thing has flowered so well

00:48:13.891 --> 00:48:18.100
that any magazine, anything you take,

00:48:18.559 --> 00:48:20.600
and you can't understand

00:48:20.891 --> 00:48:22.225
what are they preaching.

00:48:22.559 --> 00:48:27.975
They are preaching the cult of destruction completely.

00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:33.100
And people take it, and like it, and work it out.

00:48:33.100 --> 00:48:36.600
They are using the women for their own purpose

00:48:36.600 --> 00:48:39.309
and stupidly women accept it.

00:48:40.933 --> 00:48:42.683
Of course they dominate,

00:48:42.683 --> 00:48:45.559
on one side feel very happy that they are dominating.

00:48:46.350 --> 00:48:50.808
There was a lady who was boasting in one magazine

00:48:51.058 --> 00:48:53.641
that she has had four hundred men in her life.

00:48:53.641 --> 00:48:55.600
Can you imagine?

00:48:56.475 --> 00:48:59.599
Now there is no place for hell for such a woman even.

00:49:00.933 --> 00:49:03.392
Where will you put such a woman there?

00:49:04.142 --> 00:49:06.766
Now I don't know; that's another problem.

00:49:15.517 --> 00:49:18.267
So this movement,

00:49:19.142 --> 00:49:23.600
which is absolutely against the principle of dharma

00:49:24.225 --> 00:49:26.683
and of communication.

00:49:27.309 --> 00:49:30.600
Now how you must communicate

00:49:31.267 --> 00:49:33.434
decently,

00:49:33.850 --> 00:49:35.434
with very tender

00:49:37.434 --> 00:49:41.725
and very beautiful mannerism

00:49:42.058 --> 00:49:45.933
you have to talk to another person,

00:49:46.392 --> 00:49:48.683
talk to other Sahaja Yogis,

00:49:49.142 --> 00:49:50.850
talk to anyone,

00:49:51.600 --> 00:49:54.517
is in a very sweet manner you should talk.

00:49:54.517 --> 00:49:57.766
I do not mean the French style, you see,

00:49:57.766 --> 00:50:01.891
bending your body and all artificial stuff. Not that.

00:50:01.891 --> 00:50:06.975
I'm saying that if you are naturally talking to somebody,

00:50:08.225 --> 00:50:10.975
you should talk with decent language,

00:50:12.350 --> 00:50:16.100
with decency, with humility

00:50:17.517 --> 00:50:19.641
and need not go on jabbering all the time

00:50:19.641 --> 00:50:22.225
and talking too much. There's no need.

00:50:22.975 --> 00:50:24.850
But, on the contrary,

00:50:25.183 --> 00:50:27.559
this was the style was Shri Krishna.

00:50:27.766 --> 00:50:30.725
In short, His power was madhurya;

00:50:31.183 --> 00:50:34.100
is the sweetness, like the honey.

00:50:35.891 --> 00:50:39.559
When you are worshiping Shri Krishna

00:50:39.766 --> 00:50:42.434
you have to know that you must talk

00:50:42.766 --> 00:50:47.475
in a manner that will please another person.

00:51:04.641 --> 00:51:08.309
So, while talking to anyone

00:51:08.309 --> 00:51:10.725
you can talk very sweetly,

00:51:11.183 --> 00:51:16.225
very nicely and in a way which will please that person,

00:51:16.225 --> 00:51:17.725
not to provoke,

00:51:17.725 --> 00:51:20.309
not to say things which are hard.

00:51:20.766 --> 00:51:22.766
But some people have a habit

00:51:23.183 --> 00:51:27.850
of saying all the time something which is very provoking,

00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:31.183
which is not at all good.

00:51:32.434 --> 00:51:35.183
But some people are,

00:51:37.058 --> 00:51:40.766
when it comes to their business are very sweet,

00:51:41.725 --> 00:51:45.309
but when it comes to something else they are very harsh.

00:51:45.641 --> 00:51:48.350
We have a Jain community in India.

00:51:48.725 --> 00:51:50.350
I've seen many Jains.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:52.975
When they are for their business

00:51:53.225 --> 00:51:55.225
they're the sweetest you could know,

00:51:55.933 --> 00:52:01.559
but when it comes to something else

00:52:01.850 --> 00:52:04.725
like donating some money or something,

00:52:05.225 --> 00:52:07.559
they're extremely hard.

00:52:08.058 --> 00:52:10.725
They will only donate for stupid things,

00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.766
but not for something sensible.

00:52:14.517 --> 00:52:17.309
They'll work for something extremely stupid,

00:52:17.850 --> 00:52:20.434
but never for anything sensible.

00:52:20.434 --> 00:52:24.058
We have another community called as Sindhis.

00:52:24.058 --> 00:52:26.766
I think they are under the influence of the West.

00:52:27.142 --> 00:52:29.517
Same with the Western people.

00:52:30.142 --> 00:52:33.599
If you show that you have some business with them,

00:52:34.599 --> 00:52:36.766
suddenly you know, they change.

00:52:37.142 --> 00:52:39.475
Suddenly they change. You can't understand

00:52:39.683 --> 00:52:41.641
what has happened to this man.

00:52:42.350 --> 00:52:46.683
Or, if they find out you are something in life, they change.

00:52:47.017 --> 00:52:50.100
Shri Krishna was just the other way round.

00:52:50.599 --> 00:52:57.350
In His lifetime, He was always a guest of Vidhura

00:52:57.683 --> 00:53:05.058
who was the son of a Dhasi, is the servant.

00:53:05.058 --> 00:53:09.267
Maidservant's son was Vidhura, but he was a realized soul.

00:53:09.683 --> 00:53:12.808
So He used to go to his house,

00:53:13.225 --> 00:53:16.766
stay in his house, a very humble abode, Vidhura's,

00:53:17.142 --> 00:53:20.808
and eat food there, very simple food.

00:53:21.225 --> 00:53:25.100
But He would not go to the palace of Duryodhana.

00:53:26.808 --> 00:53:28.766
The other way round.

00:53:29.225 --> 00:53:31.891
I mean, somebody thinks that you have a palace,

00:53:32.225 --> 00:53:35.350
they'll be extremely kind to you, very nice, you know.

00:53:36.017 --> 00:53:39.142
But they say he lives in a hut, then he's nothing.

00:53:41.350 --> 00:53:44.142
It's such a money orientation in subtle way.

00:53:45.350 --> 00:53:48.517
Shri Krishna never, never cared for money

00:53:49.017 --> 00:53:51.350
and never bothered about it.

00:53:52.225 --> 00:53:54.683
You can see His case

00:53:55.350 --> 00:54:00.350
in which He has shown complete detachment

00:54:00.683 --> 00:54:04.808
about His throne, or His kingdom,

00:54:05.350 --> 00:54:08.267
or money part of it.

00:54:08.933 --> 00:54:13.100
Once you are attached you have all the pangs of money.

00:54:13.641 --> 00:54:15.891
Naturally, if you are catching hold of a snake

00:54:16.142 --> 00:54:20.142
you'll always be having the pangs of the snake, don't you?

00:54:20.392 --> 00:54:22.683
But supposing you are detached.

00:54:23.517 --> 00:54:26.475
Then the same money you can use.

00:54:27.933 --> 00:54:30.599
Once you become slave of that money,

00:54:30.891 --> 00:54:33.392
that money sits on your head.

00:54:34.808 --> 00:54:38.599
Now, you know very well that to have money

00:54:38.808 --> 00:54:41.017
also is dangerous these days.

00:54:42.599 --> 00:54:45.017
The whole reaction is building up

00:54:45.350 --> 00:54:47.559
and this is where the whole

00:54:47.766 --> 00:54:50.766
all the elements are reacting against you.

00:54:52.017 --> 00:54:56.017
You have seen the wisdom of these people from Sierra Nevada,

00:54:56.392 --> 00:54:58.392
and what they said is true

00:54:59.017 --> 00:55:07.683
that when we try to acquire more money,

00:55:08.600 --> 00:55:11.017
go on acquiring, go on acquiring

00:55:12.017 --> 00:55:15.933
and getting a idea in our head,

00:55:17.517 --> 00:55:20.599
then there are looters who come round.

00:55:20.808 --> 00:55:22.725
I think the worst are those

00:55:23.017 --> 00:55:27.017
who have got names as entrepreneurs.

00:55:27.392 --> 00:55:29.599
For example, they'll say, "Now,

00:55:29.808 --> 00:55:33.517
if you have a designer's watch",

00:55:37.683 --> 00:55:41.017
then everybody ran for designer's watches.

00:55:43.017 --> 00:55:48.142
The other day I went to Italy, no, to Istanbul

00:55:48.475 --> 00:55:51.808
and I found out that the T-shirts are made there

00:55:52.142 --> 00:55:55.183
and sold in France as if they are French. They are not.

00:55:55.517 --> 00:56:02.267
They are A to Z, they are made in there, which is Istanbul

00:56:02.808 --> 00:56:05.517
and the name is on that Lacoste,

00:56:05.725 --> 00:56:07.600
this that and all that.

00:56:07.933 --> 00:56:10.683
And people pay any amount, but not in Turkey.

00:56:10.933 --> 00:56:15.808
Whatever surplus is left we can get it for seven pounds.

00:56:17.142 --> 00:56:21.142
Now the stupidity is that they can befool you.

00:56:23.267 --> 00:56:26.267
Pierre Cardin, then there's another one,

00:56:26.725 --> 00:56:30.517
I don't know, Armani - that's in Italy only,

00:56:30.725 --> 00:56:33.058
but in America there are many.

00:56:33.309 --> 00:56:36.058
Even, I mean, they come to you,

00:56:36.309 --> 00:56:37.434
to your house.

00:56:37.434 --> 00:56:39.183
England is much worse.

00:56:39.517 --> 00:56:40.850
They're so unmannerly,

00:56:41.142 --> 00:56:42.975
they'll come to your house for dinner

00:56:43.392 --> 00:56:46.975
and they'll turn the plate to see where it is made.

00:56:48.017 --> 00:56:49.975
Really. Openly.

00:56:50.434 --> 00:56:54.267
And they'll discuss from where the cutlery has come.

00:56:57.683 --> 00:57:01.183
So, though they think they're very rich,

00:57:01.183 --> 00:57:05.058
stupidly they are being exploited by this kind of a nonsense

00:57:05.850 --> 00:57:09.142
that you have this watch, you have this thing.

00:57:09.517 --> 00:57:13.058
Now, in England we have something called Saville Row,

00:57:13.850 --> 00:57:16.434
so that they put it outside, you know,

00:57:16.434 --> 00:57:19.142
outside the coat - Saville Row.

00:57:19.142 --> 00:57:21.183
Can you imagine?

00:57:21.434 --> 00:57:23.058
Branded.

00:57:23.517 --> 00:57:27.933
See, everything is made into a big ado.

00:57:28.392 --> 00:57:30.599
So on one side they are very intelligent

00:57:30.808 --> 00:57:32.975
to understand this is the business,

00:57:32.975 --> 00:57:36.600
this is the fashion all that.

00:57:36.933 --> 00:57:39.683
The other side they don't know they are fools,

00:57:40.183 --> 00:57:42.392
being befooled all the time by saying

00:57:42.600 --> 00:57:45.600
this is the special thing, that is the special thing

00:57:45.975 --> 00:57:49.725
and that it has a name and it has, what you call,

00:57:50.142 --> 00:57:54.267
the - a great organization behind it.

00:57:56.850 --> 00:58:00.058
Sahaja Yogis should understand this is all befooling

00:58:00.517 --> 00:58:03.850
and stupid thing and they wear,

00:58:04.142 --> 00:58:06.599
all of them will wear like that just to show off.

00:58:07.933 --> 00:58:09.183
What is it?

00:58:09.183 --> 00:58:12.933
Why should this impress anyone?

00:58:13.517 --> 00:58:15.309
Think of it.

00:58:15.683 --> 00:58:19.434
Now, intelligently think why should it impress you,

00:58:19.975 --> 00:58:22.517
these befooling things that are going on?

00:58:22.725 --> 00:58:23.725
Nothing special.

00:58:23.725 --> 00:58:26.058
They are just the same.

00:58:26.392 --> 00:58:30.808
They told Me in Istanbul that they make ordinary ones

00:58:31.058 --> 00:58:33.392
and then they put on top of this mark

00:58:33.683 --> 00:58:37.058
and the ordinary ones are for, say,

00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:41.183
six dollars, so with this thing is for seven dollars.

00:58:43.517 --> 00:58:45.599
There's nothing special,

00:58:46.725 --> 00:58:50.725
but this special trickery, I think,

00:58:50.725 --> 00:58:55.183
is coming from England and America especially

00:58:55.850 --> 00:59:00.309
maybe also from France, but France are, you know,

00:59:00.309 --> 00:59:01.808
queer people.

00:59:02.267 --> 00:59:05.392
Now they have something. I showed them today -

00:59:05.808 --> 00:59:09.058
So stupidly made thing,

00:59:09.392 --> 00:59:12.517
which cost five hundred pounds,

00:59:12.975 --> 00:59:16.850
but people accept because they have no wisdom.

00:59:17.434 --> 00:59:21.933
Now see the difference between the intelligence and wisdom.

00:59:23.683 --> 00:59:26.309
Why to show off, first of all

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.142
and to show off something which has no meaning?

00:59:29.434 --> 00:59:36.142
It cost only one dollar in Turkey to put that thing on

00:59:36.142 --> 00:59:39.183
and stupidly people are showing it.

00:59:43.392 --> 00:59:48.725
Is it that we have intelligence,

00:59:49.808 --> 00:59:52.058
but which has no divine power?

00:59:52.392 --> 00:59:55.933
Anybody can befool you to do what you like.

00:59:56.309 --> 00:59:58.309
Now six inches of skirt started.

00:59:58.309 --> 01:00:00.142
All right, everywhere six inches.

01:00:00.392 --> 01:00:03.267
You couldn't get one with the seven inches even.

01:00:03.933 --> 01:00:05.600
That's not in the fashion.

01:00:05.850 --> 01:00:08.808
That's not in - means 'in' in madhouse?

01:00:11.808 --> 01:00:16.309
Now just look at Shri Krishna's style - so wise,

01:00:17.183 --> 01:00:18.933
witnessing everything,

01:00:19.267 --> 01:00:21.309
how He plays around

01:00:23.017 --> 01:00:25.058
and how He wins over.

01:00:25.933 --> 01:00:28.183
Now, supposing He was attached.

01:00:28.183 --> 01:00:30.933
He could not have done it.

01:00:32.683 --> 01:00:36.517
So to get over this, first of all, you detach yourself from this

01:00:36.808 --> 01:00:39.599
anti-Shri Krishna culture.

01:00:39.599 --> 01:00:41.725
It's very important.

01:00:43.017 --> 01:00:45.434
This is the fashion. That is the fashion.

01:00:45.850 --> 01:00:50.933
And all these fashions are extremely, extremely destructive.

01:00:51.183 --> 01:00:53.933
Now, not to put oil in the hair

01:00:55.142 --> 01:00:57.808
and end up with bald heads. All right.

01:00:58.142 --> 01:01:00.142
Then there are specialists, you see,

01:01:00.142 --> 01:01:04.183
again designers who make wigs, designer's wig.

01:01:04.434 --> 01:01:07.725
So you carry a wig on your head and write it down, 'designer's.'

01:01:12.808 --> 01:01:14.933
My idea is to see

01:01:15.392 --> 01:01:20.850
how stupid human beings can become with their intellect.

01:01:22.850 --> 01:01:27.599
Today I don't want to describe the qualities of Shri Krishna

01:01:27.599 --> 01:01:29.725
because you know them.

01:01:30.808 --> 01:01:33.725
But how you people have gone away,

01:01:34.183 --> 01:01:39.683
in the West, from Shri Krishna's styles,

01:01:39.933 --> 01:01:41.725
His methods.

01:01:42.309 --> 01:01:45.309
Whatever He did was to destroy the evil,

01:01:46.017 --> 01:01:48.475
to destroy the negativity

01:01:48.808 --> 01:01:51.517
and to bring forth the joy,

01:01:52.142 --> 01:01:56.599
which is Ras, He started. "Ras" - Ra is energy with that.

01:01:57.183 --> 01:01:59.725
The Ras is the energy,

01:02:00.058 --> 01:02:03.599
which you have

01:02:04.183 --> 01:02:07.309
and that's how you play the Ras,

01:02:07.599 --> 01:02:09.517
with that energy and enjoy.

01:02:09.725 --> 01:02:11.183
He brought it Holi.

01:02:11.183 --> 01:02:13.142
Of course now "Holi" can be anything,

01:02:13.392 --> 01:02:19.017
but very sensible Holy he brought just to express your joy

01:02:19.267 --> 01:02:21.683
in mirthful, playful ways,

01:02:22.058 --> 01:02:25.725
because that was lacking in Shri Rama's life.

01:02:25.725 --> 01:02:29.517
So He said just allow yourself to enjoy,

01:02:29.517 --> 01:02:33.850
but this was only for Sahaja Yogis.

01:02:34.599 --> 01:02:36.183
Not for others.

01:02:36.183 --> 01:02:40.434
Others, you know that they go to the pubs

01:02:40.434 --> 01:02:43.267
and what happens. We have a certificate here that

01:02:43.267 --> 01:02:47.183
we are very peaceful, very good people, this and that.

01:02:47.475 --> 01:02:50.017
This is what Shri Krishna said

01:02:50.475 --> 01:02:52.017
and has done,

01:02:52.475 --> 01:02:55.309
that we have to enjoy everything,

01:02:55.641 --> 01:02:58.017
but in a dharmic way.

01:02:58.891 --> 01:03:00.891
We should not be adharmic.

01:03:01.766 --> 01:03:04.225
The Dharma should give you Joy.

01:03:04.475 --> 01:03:07.017
Otherwise, if you are dharmic, you know what happens,

01:03:07.309 --> 01:03:09.641
that you become absolutely austere,

01:03:12.017 --> 01:03:14.142
person, joyless person

01:03:14.850 --> 01:03:19.142
and sometimes cynical

01:03:19.683 --> 01:03:22.350
because you think others are adharmic and this and that.

01:03:22.891 --> 01:03:26.475
But Shri Krishna's ways were that you should be mirthful,

01:03:26.475 --> 01:03:28.142
you should be joyful

01:03:28.142 --> 01:03:31.475
and this joy will communicate with others.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:38.559
Without this joyous nature you cannot be communicator.

01:03:39.225 --> 01:03:41.350
But, as you know, when I went to French,

01:03:41.641 --> 01:03:43.434
they told Me, "Mother, you look so joyous,

01:03:43.641 --> 01:03:45.475
you should tell you are miserable."

01:03:45.683 --> 01:03:47.267
I said, "But I am not."

01:03:47.267 --> 01:03:49.599
"If you don't tell, then they won't believe you."

01:03:49.808 --> 01:03:51.683
I said, "Why?" "Because they are all miserable

01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.100
and they think they are very unhappy people."

01:03:55.891 --> 01:03:59.225
So I started my lecture with "Les Miserables"

01:03:59.683 --> 01:04:04.225
and I told them that at every fourth lamppost

01:04:04.641 --> 01:04:08.975
you find a prostitute and every tenth one a pub.

01:04:10.142 --> 01:04:14.975
And I see so many people sitting on the pavement,

01:04:15.225 --> 01:04:17.434
so I asked them, "Why are they sitting here?"

01:04:17.434 --> 01:04:19.641
Said, "They are waiting the whole world to be destroyed."

01:04:19.641 --> 01:04:23.559
I said, "Really?" After drinking, these ideas come in,

01:04:23.766 --> 01:04:25.392
that let the whole world be destroyed

01:04:25.392 --> 01:04:28.475
because maybe they don't have any more money to go to pubs.

01:04:28.475 --> 01:04:30.225
I don't know why.

01:04:31.641 --> 01:04:34.100
Now, think their level,

01:04:34.599 --> 01:04:36.766
just think of their level.

01:04:37.559 --> 01:04:39.100
Where are they

01:04:41.559 --> 01:04:43.100
compared to you all?

01:04:44.017 --> 01:04:48.559
So He's the one, as Virata,

01:04:48.766 --> 01:04:51.017
puts light into your brain.

01:04:53.225 --> 01:04:56.475
In that light you see what is stupid;

01:04:56.808 --> 01:04:58.559
what is unwise.

01:04:58.933 --> 01:05:01.641
This is the blessing of Shri Krishna.

01:05:03.267 --> 01:05:08.350
And He gives you the nirananda

01:05:08.641 --> 01:05:12.559
because if you don't have the light you cannot enjoy

01:05:14.017 --> 01:05:18.392
the joy of your mind

01:05:18.683 --> 01:05:20.933
or the joy of your brain.

01:05:21.267 --> 01:05:22.559
You cannot.

01:05:23.475 --> 01:05:26.808
And it is through His light

01:05:27.392 --> 01:05:29.017
that we see

01:05:31.017 --> 01:05:36.017
ourselves as something full of joy

01:05:36.017 --> 01:05:38.599
and we don't know what to do with it

01:05:40.766 --> 01:05:42.350
and how to do it;

01:05:42.350 --> 01:05:44.392
how to express our joy;

01:05:44.766 --> 01:05:47.225
how to express our feelings.

01:05:47.225 --> 01:05:49.766
Because it's too much.

01:05:49.766 --> 01:05:53.392
This another fashion to say, "It's too much."

01:05:54.475 --> 01:05:57.142
Anything you tell them," Mother,it is too much."

01:05:57.142 --> 01:06:00.183
Because the brain is full of nonsense,

01:06:00.434 --> 01:06:02.850
so you tell them anything, nothing can go in their heads.

01:06:02.850 --> 01:06:04.725
"It's too much."

01:06:06.392 --> 01:06:09.058
So the wise person,

01:06:09.725 --> 01:06:11.808
as Shri Krishna is,

01:06:12.309 --> 01:06:14.142
wisest of wise,

01:06:14.599 --> 01:06:16.725
He's the source of wisdom,

01:06:17.392 --> 01:06:19.850
has to be Stitha Pragya.

01:06:20.933 --> 01:06:23.599
Means he has to be in balance,

01:06:23.933 --> 01:06:26.183
he has to be in dharma

01:06:29.725 --> 01:06:33.392
and, above that,

01:06:33.725 --> 01:06:36.600
he has to be in Joy.

01:06:37.600 --> 01:06:41.850
Now, you are not only in joy, but you know the truth.

01:06:41.850 --> 01:06:44.017
You know the absolute truth.

01:06:46.267 --> 01:06:48.434
And this absolute truth

01:06:48.683 --> 01:06:53.267
is the one that makes you understand

01:06:54.309 --> 01:06:58.142
what is right, what is wrong and you develop your wisdom,

01:06:58.683 --> 01:07:00.933
not your intellect so much.

01:07:01.683 --> 01:07:04.434
You then see your intellect misbehaving sometimes,

01:07:04.683 --> 01:07:06.017
telling you negative ideas,

01:07:06.017 --> 01:07:08.309
sometimes too much of aggressive ideas.

01:07:08.309 --> 01:07:11.392
You can become a witness, "sakshi",

01:07:11.641 --> 01:07:12.975
and that's why Shri Krishna has said,

01:07:12.975 --> 01:07:15.850
"I am the sakshi of the whole world,

01:07:15.850 --> 01:07:18.183
the witness of the whole world."

01:07:18.808 --> 01:07:21.309
See, you can go on talking about Him,

01:07:21.850 --> 01:07:25.641
but what we have to see, where are we going wrong

01:07:26.100 --> 01:07:29.434
and how can Shri Krishna save us?

01:07:29.933 --> 01:07:33.517
Not by singing, "Hari Rama, Hari Krishna", like that.

01:07:36.309 --> 01:07:40.850
By becoming, day by day, wiser person.

01:07:43.309 --> 01:07:49.559
Wisdom gives you definite ideas as to how you have to be.

01:07:50.392 --> 01:07:53.058
If there is still this thing going on.

01:07:53.058 --> 01:07:56.350
See, in the Western way they show like this.

01:07:56.599 --> 01:07:57.683
Ask them, "How are you?"

01:07:57.683 --> 01:07:59.891
"I'm like this." Means what?

01:08:00.683 --> 01:08:02.017
"Like this."

01:08:02.017 --> 01:08:04.017
If that is still there,

01:08:04.017 --> 01:08:06.475
then Shri Krishna is not awakened,

01:08:07.766 --> 01:08:11.559
but if it is that you know what it is,

01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.683
you'll have the same smile as Shri Krishna had.

01:08:16.225 --> 01:08:19.808
I know. I know that.

01:08:21.808 --> 01:08:25.392
Now we have to understand that our Vishuddhi

01:08:25.641 --> 01:08:27.559
has to be all right.

01:08:27.766 --> 01:08:30.559
I get Vishuddhi because I know what it is.

01:08:30.559 --> 01:08:31.891
This is America, should be all right,

01:08:31.891 --> 01:08:35.142
otherwise My Vishuddhi will never be all right. I think so.

01:08:36.559 --> 01:08:38.267
But for Vishuddhi,

01:08:38.641 --> 01:08:40.933
there are so many things we have in Sahaja Yoga

01:08:41.225 --> 01:08:43.142
which very few people do.

01:08:43.475 --> 01:08:45.933
At least if you Sahaja Yogis keep your Vishuddhi all right,

01:08:46.225 --> 01:08:48.267
I'll be much better off.

01:08:48.683 --> 01:08:51.475
But you never try to keep your Vishuddhi all right.

01:08:51.475 --> 01:08:53.766
Continue with it. Continue with it.

01:08:54.017 --> 01:08:55.475
Even the president of America

01:08:55.683 --> 01:08:58.766
has the worst Vishuddhi I've ever seen,

01:08:59.017 --> 01:09:01.599
so you can imagine what good is he going to do.

01:09:02.891 --> 01:09:06.100
What wisdom will he have?

01:09:07.891 --> 01:09:10.683
Now you are a new race,

01:09:11.017 --> 01:09:14.766
blessed by the Divine,

01:09:14.766 --> 01:09:18.225
and you have Shri Krishna within yourself awakened.

01:09:18.808 --> 01:09:23.683
In His own glory, in His own light,

01:09:24.599 --> 01:09:27.350
you should know what is to be done.

01:09:28.766 --> 01:09:30.933
One must communicate.

01:09:31.392 --> 01:09:32.683
That you have to do,

01:09:32.933 --> 01:09:36.267
but what I've seen that people don't even meditate.

01:09:36.559 --> 01:09:37.808
Even if they meditate,

01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.392
they don't want to communicate.

01:09:39.683 --> 01:09:41.475
And sometimes when they communicate,

01:09:41.766 --> 01:09:44.017
they think they have become Gods.

01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.641
It's very difficult.

01:09:47.017 --> 01:09:50.017
Human beings is very

01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.392
difficult commodity to handle.

01:09:55.475 --> 01:09:58.808
You have to communicate with complete humility

01:10:00.058 --> 01:10:02.350
the way Shri Krishna did.

01:10:02.641 --> 01:10:03.933
In His ras,

01:10:04.267 --> 01:10:07.225
He spread the energy of Radha

01:10:07.808 --> 01:10:11.225
into all these people by holding hands.

01:10:11.891 --> 01:10:15.350
So His childhood where He killed so many people

01:10:15.599 --> 01:10:17.891
and did all that is over.

01:10:18.225 --> 01:10:20.808
Then even His adulthood,

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.891
where He had to kill His own uncle, is also over.

01:10:25.475 --> 01:10:27.766
So He becomes the king.

01:10:28.100 --> 01:10:33.017
When He becomes the king then what does He do?

01:10:33.267 --> 01:10:35.142
Is to communicate.

01:10:35.599 --> 01:10:37.100
Most of His,

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:41.142
expressions of His qualities

01:10:41.142 --> 01:10:44.766
are seen after He became the king.

01:10:45.017 --> 01:10:47.683
Before that He was busy killing,

01:10:47.933 --> 01:10:50.475
one after another, all these horrible people.

01:10:50.808 --> 01:10:53.225
After that He built,

01:10:54.017 --> 01:10:55.142
built up people.

01:10:55.142 --> 01:10:57.891
He built Dwarika and

01:10:59.350 --> 01:11:02.267
He tried to communicate

01:11:03.808 --> 01:11:05.142
with people.

01:11:05.392 --> 01:11:08.142
Now your duty is to build up yourself

01:11:08.142 --> 01:11:10.267
and to communicate with others

01:11:10.933 --> 01:11:14.766
with all the sweetness, madhurya of Shri Krishna,

01:11:15.017 --> 01:11:17.392
all the beauty of Shri Krishna,

01:11:18.225 --> 01:11:20.267
with full understanding

01:11:20.517 --> 01:11:23.475
as to what stupid things are going round and around.

01:11:24.641 --> 01:11:27.017
Once you understand that,

01:11:27.891 --> 01:11:30.225
you'll not take it because you will become wise

01:11:30.517 --> 01:11:33.392
enough not to take to all these nonsensical things

01:11:33.683 --> 01:11:35.100
that are going on.

01:11:35.100 --> 01:11:36.350
And it is so much,

01:11:36.350 --> 01:11:38.808
I mean, I, in this lecture, I cannot tell you,

01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:41.350
but now if you become the witness of the whole thing

01:11:41.599 --> 01:11:43.350
you'll see what is happening.

01:11:43.599 --> 01:11:48.225
Now we have to stop them from going to Hell.

01:11:49.017 --> 01:11:55.766
And we have to really develop a very, very good personality

01:11:55.766 --> 01:11:58.142
of a Sahaja Yogi. All of you.

01:11:58.559 --> 01:12:01.225
Now, there are many marriages that take place,

01:12:01.559 --> 01:12:03.475
then suddenly they decide to divorce.

01:12:03.475 --> 01:12:05.392
Divorce is allowed in Sahaja Yoga,

01:12:05.683 --> 01:12:08.225
but this American style of nonsense

01:12:08.475 --> 01:12:10.350
I don't want to have.

01:12:11.683 --> 01:12:13.808
Women are can be very dominating.

01:12:13.808 --> 01:12:16.225
One fellow ran away to Russia.

01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:19.142
They have no idea of a marriage.

01:12:19.517 --> 01:12:21.641
They don't know how to work it out.

01:12:21.933 --> 01:12:24.392
All the sweetness of the marriage is finished.

01:12:24.392 --> 01:12:25.683
If the husband is dominating,

01:12:25.683 --> 01:12:27.142
the wife is dominating,

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.933
this happens, then you divorce.

01:12:28.933 --> 01:12:31.641
What is the achievement?

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:35.641
So we have to work out

01:12:36.142 --> 01:12:38.766
everything within us because we are conditioned,

01:12:38.766 --> 01:12:40.517
we are in an atmosphere.

01:12:40.933 --> 01:12:42.766
I would request all of you

01:12:43.891 --> 01:12:46.100
to try to understand these subtleties

01:12:46.100 --> 01:12:49.933
of Shri Krishna's personality.

01:12:49.933 --> 01:12:52.017
Try to become like that

01:12:52.267 --> 01:12:53.766
extremely peaceful,

01:12:54.933 --> 01:12:58.933
extremely kind, tender, helpful.

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.683
And in humility,

01:13:01.933 --> 01:13:04.100
He had no consciousness of money.

01:13:04.683 --> 01:13:06.350
Nothing.

01:13:06.683 --> 01:13:09.891
And also, as you know, He was a dark person

01:13:12.641 --> 01:13:14.559
for some reason,

01:13:15.599 --> 01:13:18.641
but the way He led his life

01:13:19.017 --> 01:13:20.891
should be an example for us.

01:13:22.641 --> 01:13:27.475
I'm sure, now, when you go back to your countries

01:13:27.808 --> 01:13:29.350
you'll see all this nonsense.

01:13:29.599 --> 01:13:30.891
Please note it down.

01:13:31.142 --> 01:13:33.683
Write it down what these nonsensical people are doing

01:13:33.683 --> 01:13:35.808
and send it over to Me.

01:13:36.683 --> 01:13:38.392
That's what it is.

01:13:38.392 --> 01:13:41.683
So today is the puja of Shri Krishna.

01:13:42.100 --> 01:13:45.475
I need not tell you how many qualities He has, as I told you,

01:13:45.933 --> 01:13:49.100
but the greatest quality He has that

01:13:49.350 --> 01:13:53.933
He is the doctor of doctors.

01:13:57.766 --> 01:14:01.142
Now, in His name you will know how many qualities He has

01:14:02.350 --> 01:14:03.808
and you will understand.

01:14:03.808 --> 01:14:05.267
Try to understand that

01:14:05.267 --> 01:14:07.808
we have to have these qualities within us also.

01:14:08.142 --> 01:14:10.350
Whatever qualities are described or said,

01:14:10.599 --> 01:14:12.933
try to see how many we have.

01:14:13.808 --> 01:14:16.475
That's the way the introspection will start.

01:14:16.475 --> 01:14:18.683
Once you start introspecting yourself

01:14:18.933 --> 01:14:20.683
and understanding yourself,

01:14:20.683 --> 01:14:24.100
the wisdom will grow - not by seeing faults in others,

01:14:24.350 --> 01:14:27.599
putting blames on others, but on yourself.

01:14:27.808 --> 01:14:30.766
That is how the things will work out.

01:14:31.017 --> 01:14:33.100
Though Krishna didn't have to do that because

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:35.475
He was Sampurna, He was complete.

01:14:35.475 --> 01:14:37.183
But we have to do all this

01:14:37.183 --> 01:14:39.975
to see that we also become complete.

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.559
Thank you very much.

01:14:42.559 --> 01:14:44.641
May God bless you all.

01:14:52.517 --> 01:14:54.350
May God bless you.

01:14:57.725 --> 01:15:01.891
There's another point I wanted to mention about Sahaja Yogis,

01:15:02.559 --> 01:15:07.350
that we introduce classical Indian music for you people,

01:15:08.641 --> 01:15:11.975
because I think it helps for vibrations.

01:15:12.975 --> 01:15:15.350
But as the nature is of western people,

01:15:15.350 --> 01:15:20.183
anything they take up they must go to the utilmate end

01:15:20.517 --> 01:15:23.058
'til they are completely lost.

01:15:23.850 --> 01:15:30.183
So what I find now all of them are buying tapes.

01:15:31.599 --> 01:15:35.017
Some tapes ...

01:15:49.559 --> 01:15:54.267
Now some of them are buying tapes, I was surprised,

01:15:54.267 --> 01:15:57.766
of very unknown people, just mad.

01:15:59.850 --> 01:16:02.434
Once I was traveling with a lady in America,

01:16:02.683 --> 01:16:04.683
was a disciple of Muktanand.

01:16:05.142 --> 01:16:09.017
She said, "I have a very nice tape," and she played the,

01:16:09.017 --> 01:16:10.599
the, lecture of Muktanand.

01:16:10.599 --> 01:16:14.766
Rajneesh's people will play the lecture of Rajneesh.

01:16:15.225 --> 01:16:18.350
But here now they've all gone to one side,

01:16:18.641 --> 01:16:19.975
so this one, that one,

01:16:20.475 --> 01:16:23.683
all kinds of music they have got.

01:16:24.475 --> 01:16:26.225
Tomorrow, we start

01:16:27.267 --> 01:16:30.599
telling you that you must understand Indian dancing,

01:16:31.017 --> 01:16:34.434
so all my videos will be replaced by Indian dancing

01:16:34.434 --> 01:16:36.142
from A to Z.

01:16:37.641 --> 01:16:40.017
You are Sahaja Yogis.

01:16:40.434 --> 01:16:43.559
It's all right, I am also fond of music,

01:16:43.850 --> 01:16:45.350
but it's not the way.

01:16:45.599 --> 01:16:48.100
What is the main thing of your life?

01:16:48.975 --> 01:16:52.683
And I was surprised how people are lost in the music.

01:16:54.599 --> 01:16:57.559
I mean there should be some occasion.

01:16:58.559 --> 01:17:02.599
They're all already in another world with the music.

01:17:03.434 --> 01:17:04.766
Don't do these things.

01:17:05.017 --> 01:17:07.559
You go to extremes of everything.

01:17:07.850 --> 01:17:10.267
That's not proper, even pujas, anything,

01:17:10.267 --> 01:17:11.975
you go to extremes.

01:17:11.975 --> 01:17:14.599
To go to extremes, you won't be in the center.

01:17:14.975 --> 01:17:19.475
You will not be in the place of Shri Krishna,

01:17:19.766 --> 01:17:21.850
where you have to be.

01:17:22.142 --> 01:17:24.309
On the contrary, you will be

01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.975
just in another imaginary world.

01:17:29.891 --> 01:17:35.559
So, as a matter of habit we create a world like that;

01:17:35.766 --> 01:17:37.100
somebody has music world;

01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:38.850
somebody has dancing world;

01:17:39.100 --> 01:17:40.683
another one has,

01:17:43.475 --> 01:17:47.017
world, I've seen with Sahaja Yogis who think

01:17:47.434 --> 01:17:49.225
no end of themselves.

01:17:49.475 --> 01:17:51.891
"We have a special relationship with Shri Mataji."

01:17:51.891 --> 01:17:53.559
Is a very common thing.

01:17:53.766 --> 01:17:56.559
But I cannot have any special relationship.

01:17:57.683 --> 01:17:58.766
Sorry,

01:18:01.766 --> 01:18:05.434
nobody has any special relationship with Me.

01:18:05.891 --> 01:18:08.766
This I would like to tell you very clearly,

01:18:09.350 --> 01:18:11.309
and you should not claim that,

01:18:11.683 --> 01:18:14.017
and then become, some people say, "we are deities."

01:18:14.017 --> 01:18:17.559
I mean this is something to be - horrible.

01:18:18.641 --> 01:18:22.641
I'll speak for two minutes in Marathi if you don't mind...

01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:25.766
Now I want to talk to the Maharashtrian girls.

01:18:26.683 --> 01:18:28.517
You have been married here,

01:18:28.517 --> 01:18:30.600
and have got rich husbands.

01:18:32.017 --> 01:18:33.058
But as soon as you came here

01:18:33.599 --> 01:18:36.559
you've started sending money to your parents.

01:18:36.850 --> 01:18:38.808
Does this happen in India?

01:18:38.808 --> 01:18:41.183
Can you send money to your parents from your in laws' house.

01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:44.475
Secondly is ornaments.

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.392
You've started making a lot of ornaments.

01:18:46.808 --> 01:18:48.475
I asked a Sahaja yogi husband

01:18:49.017 --> 01:18:50.808
why don't you buy a shirt for yourself.

01:18:50.808 --> 01:18:51.850
He said, "what should I do,

01:18:52.183 --> 01:18:53.891
my wife is spending all the money on ornaments."

01:18:54.350 --> 01:18:59.766
This greed for ornaments does not behove a Sahaja Yogi.

01:19:04.517 --> 01:19:06.683
This is a very serious matter.

01:19:07.058 --> 01:19:09.891
Recently I learnt that all the Indian ladies

01:19:09.891 --> 01:19:13.850
have made ornaments after marriage.

01:19:16.058 --> 01:19:18.142
Thus there is no money left with the husband.

01:19:18.434 --> 01:19:20.475
Those husbands who used to support Sahaja yoga before

01:19:20.808 --> 01:19:21.975
are unable to do so after the marriage.

01:19:22.267 --> 01:19:24.933
They have no money left with them.

01:19:25.267 --> 01:19:26.142
What has happened to you.

01:19:26.142 --> 01:19:28.725
you've come here from the land of saints.

01:19:29.517 --> 01:19:36.225
Shivaji Maharaj had a great respect for Shri Saint Tukaram

01:19:36.517 --> 01:19:39.475
and he took some ornaments for his wife.

01:19:41.559 --> 01:19:43.766
His wife must be somebody like you,

01:19:44.017 --> 01:19:46.891
as she immediately accepted the ornaments.

01:19:46.891 --> 01:19:50.850
Why should one be so much fond of ornaments?

01:19:50.850 --> 01:19:52.017
Even being a Goddess I am not fond of ornaments,

01:19:52.475 --> 01:19:54.683
then why should you be so fond of them?

01:19:56.559 --> 01:19:59.933
Since they compulsorily offer me that's why I accept.

01:20:00.392 --> 01:20:07.225
So he gave and she accepted the ornaments,

01:20:07.850 --> 01:20:08.850
Saint Tukaram came and said,

01:20:09.891 --> 01:20:12.725
"What is the need to have the ornaments for saints like us?"

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:17.350
So he returned back all the ornaments.

01:20:17.683 --> 01:20:21.142
Know that you've come here from land of saints

01:20:21.683 --> 01:20:25.267
and this attitude of yours is a sign of poorness.

01:20:25.267 --> 01:20:27.100
You've been sending money to your parents

01:20:27.475 --> 01:20:32.766
and I cannot explain to you how far this has gone.

01:20:40.183 --> 01:20:43.891
You've not come here to misbehave like this.

01:20:43.891 --> 01:20:46.058
You've come here to help Sahaja Yoga

01:20:46.350 --> 01:20:51.933
and not for making ornaments.

01:20:51.933 --> 01:20:54.142
If you do them once in a while it's all right

01:20:56.434 --> 01:20:59.850
but if you put all the attention on ornaments

01:21:00.891 --> 01:21:03.183
you might lose your husband and he might leave Sahaja Yoga.

01:21:03.517 --> 01:21:06.475
This would be good deed (meant not good), you will achieve!!

01:21:08.142 --> 01:21:09.100
Without My permission henceforth,

01:21:09.392 --> 01:21:11.559
nobody should make any ornaments.

01:21:24.100 --> 01:21:26.933
We'll have the Pooja now.
