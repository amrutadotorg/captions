02:10.526 --> 02:14.176
Why the children are crying?

02:48.292 --> 02:56.579
Today we are celebrating Sahastrara day.

02:57.099 --> 03:06.756
Perhaps we have not realised what a day it must have been.

03:08.624 --> 03:16.963
Without opening the Sahastrara, God Itself was a myth,

03:17.545 --> 03:25.675
religion itself was a myth, and all talk about Divinity was a myth.

03:26.686 --> 03:31.792
People believed in it but it was just a belief.

03:32.328 --> 03:39.039
And the science, as it was put forward,

03:39.471 --> 03:56.558
was about to obliterate all the value system,
all the proof of God Almighty.

03:57.796 --> 04:04.436
If you see in the history, one after another,

04:04.661 --> 04:09.828
when science established itself,

04:10.268 --> 04:17.641
the people who are so-called in charge of
the helm of affairs in religion,

04:17.880 --> 04:24.273
in different religions tried to cope with the findings of science.

04:24.511 --> 04:32.509
They tried to show that:
“All right, if it is said this much – is in the Bible,

04:32.663 --> 04:39.690
and if it is wrong we should correct it.”
Especially Augustine did that.

04:40.167 --> 04:48.760
And it started looking as if it’s all a stupidity this,

04:50.061 --> 04:54.321
these scriptures were just mythical.

04:54.457 --> 05:03.309
At least the Koran itself, though, had lots of things which were

05:03.812 --> 05:10.134
describing the biology of today.

05:11.919 --> 05:19.502
They could not believe that human beings
were specially created by God.

05:19.619 --> 05:23.974
They thought it was a matter of chance that one after another

05:24.067 --> 05:30.435
the animals acquired a situation by which they became human beings.

05:34.628 --> 05:40.703
Thus all the time Divinity was challenged

05:40.980 --> 05:45.688
and there was no way of giving a proof of whatever

05:45.821 --> 05:53.664
is said in the Bible or in the Koran or in the Gita

05:53.982 --> 06:00.862
or in the Upanishadas or in the Torah.

06:00.968 --> 06:06.775
Any one of these things could not be proved

06:07.027 --> 06:10.444
because it was still just a faith.

06:10.630 --> 06:13.781
Very, very few people got their Realisation

06:13.888 --> 06:16.600
and when they talked,  people did not believe them

06:16.625 --> 06:20.569
and thought that they are just trying to say something

06:20.594 --> 06:26.919
which they are using to propound their own theories.

06:27.064 --> 06:33.901
So the whole thing became a kind of dead science.

06:34.047 --> 06:39.364
There was no science of religion.

06:39.389 --> 06:44.147
People started thinking that:
what’s the use of following these ten commandments

06:44.386 --> 06:52.310
or these strict rules of life,
because by following that you gain nothing.

06:52.376 --> 06:55.061
You lose all the fun of the life.

06:55.109 --> 06:59.604
And why think of gaining some punyas also.

06:59.629 --> 07:08.380
And that is how all the time there was
a big derailment of human value system.

07:08.829 --> 07:16.573
Also these organised religions, this monolithic organised religions

07:16.666 --> 07:24.553
started taking to [a] course of gaining power, or gaining money,

07:24.553 --> 07:29.410
because they thought that’s the only way
you can control people and can go on.

07:29.497 --> 07:36.927
They were least bothered as to deliver the goods,
whatever have been described in the Bible.

07:37.034 --> 07:44.309
Bible of course was tampered [with] very much
and has been lot of changes in that.

07:44.422 --> 07:51.057
And a person like Paul, and Peter, who joined together,

07:51.217 --> 07:54.616
tried to spoil most of the Truth.

07:55.068 --> 07:57.911
Though Koran was not so much touched

07:58.017 --> 08:01.522
but still is dealt with more the right side,

08:01.612 --> 08:05.721
with the reproductive system and all those things.

08:05.826 --> 08:09.503
And so many things are still ambiguous.

08:10.374 --> 08:16.163
Now simultaneously two things have happened,
I don’t know if you are aware of it or not.

08:16.244 --> 08:20.790
First thing that has happened is that now we have

08:20.856 --> 08:24.713
a new science of microbiology

08:24.969 --> 08:33.385
in which we have discovered that every cell has got a DNA tape.

08:33.795 --> 08:38.415
Every cell has got a program in it.

08:38.444 --> 08:44.206
As we have in a computer a chip, every cell has got

08:44.471 --> 08:51.034
a tape in it, in a way, that it is programmed.

08:51.312 --> 08:54.921
And according to that program a development takes place.

08:54.946 --> 08:57.818
Now imagine the intricacy of the whole thing!

08:57.988 --> 09:01.773
So many computers are already programmed

09:01.906 --> 09:06.482
and all these cells have these in them.

09:06.615 --> 09:14.119
So a very mysterious sort of a thing
has come up

09:14.144 --> 09:17.531
before the scientists and they cannot explain it.

09:17.631 --> 09:22.811
They cannot explain many things but one of them is this.

09:22.926 --> 09:26.277
Now what Sahaja Yoga has done is that

09:26.346 --> 09:30.862
it has proved that it is the Will of God,

09:31.004 --> 09:34.777
it is the desire of God, the Will of God,

09:34.857 --> 09:40.373
which is doing all the work.

09:40.894 --> 09:42.690
And it has been proved.

09:42.805 --> 09:48.445
All these Chaitanya, Adi Shakti, is nothing but the Will of God.

09:48.728 --> 09:51.981
And Will of God is the One

09:52.140 --> 09:55.709
is working out everything very harmoniously.

09:55.805 --> 09:59.034
I don’t know if some of you must have read my book,

09:59.059 --> 10:03.990
first book, where I have described how this Earth was created.

10:04.167 --> 10:08.205
There was a bang, but it was very harmonious,

10:08.276 --> 10:14.917
and how it developed is through the Will of God.

10:16.085 --> 10:23.545
So everything was done in a way that God’s will was working it out.

10:24.613 --> 10:29.217
Now the Will of God you are feeling it, on your finger tips.

10:29.474 --> 10:35.140
After Realisation, now, you have discovered the the absolute science,

10:35.297 --> 10:40.879
which is the Will of God, which is an absolute science.

10:41.029 --> 10:45.162
You people know that we have cured people through Sahaja Yoga.

10:45.187 --> 10:49.183
You also know giving bandhan, and all that, things work out.

10:49.236 --> 10:51.952
So many things work out automatically

10:51.977 --> 10:55.538
after Realisation that people don’t want to believe.

10:55.644 --> 10:57.895
In the beginning people would not believe

10:57.930 --> 11:02.115
when the scientists told them something, but now it is, you can see,

11:02.140 --> 11:05.505
the science is always in the flux, all the time changing.

11:05.708 --> 11:07.799
One theory is again challenged.

11:07.824 --> 11:09.771
Another theory’s again challenged.

11:09.833 --> 11:16.841
But Sahaja Yoga has exposed you to that Great Truth of science

11:16.947 --> 11:21.997
which cannot be challenged, which is all there.

11:22.164 --> 11:27.852
So anybody who comes out with any new proposal

11:28.038 --> 11:34.091
about defaming God, or saying that there is no God,

11:34.116 --> 11:37.269
we can prove, not [only] that there is God,

11:37.296 --> 11:39.746
but that everything, the creation of this Earth,

11:39.771 --> 11:43.247
the creation of human beings and everything was done

11:43.324 --> 11:48.958
harmoniously by the Will of God.

11:49.338 --> 11:52.545
If Will of God has done everything,

11:52.570 --> 11:55.234
the human beings should not take any credit

11:55.295 --> 11:58.326
for discovering some things which were created by God.

11:58.351 --> 12:00.968
Supposing this carpet is made by somebody

12:01.021 --> 12:04.257
and we start discovering all the colours, what is so great?

12:04.292 --> 12:07.535
It is all there. You cannot create.

12:07.862 --> 12:12.256
So it is not the creation part of it [which is] so much important

12:12.390 --> 12:19.454
but the fashioning of this world, whole thing
was done by the Will of God.

12:20.141 --> 12:26.367
Now if the Will of God is so important,  it has to be proved.

12:27.416 --> 12:32.130
And now through Sahaja Yoga, after the breaking of the Sahastrara,

12:32.382 --> 12:38.244
you have now, for the first time, felt the Will of God,

12:38.966 --> 12:40.981
which is such an important thing,

12:41.006 --> 12:44.742
but for us it is come to us so Sahaj that we don’t understand.

12:44.767 --> 12:48.311
We just give the bandhan and the things work out and

12:48.367 --> 12:53.701
we feel that the things have worked out,

12:53.726 --> 12:58.186
so it is bandhan which has worked out, and

13:02.196 --> 13:05.727
we have managed everything. It’s not so.

13:05.878 --> 13:07.983
It’s much more than that.

13:08.074 --> 13:15.751
We have now become part
and parcel of that Big Computer of that Will of God.

13:15.776 --> 13:25.172
We have become the medium,
or we can say the channels, of that Will of God.

13:25.259 --> 13:32.834
We are connected with that Will of God
which created all this Universe.

13:32.834 --> 13:37.261
So everything we can manage

13:37.373 --> 13:42.634
because we have got the Absolute Science in our hand.

13:42.919 --> 13:50.453
The Absolute Science which will work out
the betterment of the whole world.

13:50.747 --> 13:56.068
We can prove it to the scientist that there is a Will of God

13:56.093 --> 13:59.042
which has done all this creation.

13:59.130 --> 14:03.703
Even evolutionary process is the Will of God.

14:04.045 --> 14:08.774
Without His Will nothing could have happened.

14:08.774 --> 14:17.146
So many people used to say that – not even a blade of grass
moves without the Will of God.

14:17.305 --> 14:19.574
Which is a very true thing.

14:20.121 --> 14:28.722
And you have seen now that –
the Will of God we have got as our own power.

14:29.365 --> 14:34.366
We can use it. So how important it is to be a sahaja yogi.

14:34.391 --> 14:39.242
Perhaps we don’t realise how important it is to be a sahaja yogi.

14:39.267 --> 14:44.351
Sahaja Yoga is not only for saying “Mother, I am full of joy,

14:44.431 --> 14:48.099
I am enjoying myself. I got purified.

14:48.124 --> 14:51.372
Everything is fine“. But for what?

14:51.492 --> 14:54.019
Why did you get all these blessings?

14:54.044 --> 15:00.244
Why you have been cleansed?
So that this knowledge of the Will of God should be apparent in you.

15:00.269 --> 15:03.774
Not only that – should be a part and parcel of you.

15:03.990 --> 15:08.117
So we have to raise our level, we have to come up.

15:08.173 --> 15:13.284
For mediocre and ordinary people
it is really useless to give them Sahaja Yoga

15:13.309 --> 15:15.447
because they are good for nothing.

15:15.601 --> 15:18.589
They are not going to help us in any way

15:18.645 --> 15:22.700
because what is needed is now, today that,

15:22.725 --> 15:28.379
we should have people who can really manifest
and reflect the Will of God.

15:28.475 --> 15:32.376
And for that, you can understand, we have to have very strong people

15:32.401 --> 15:37.542
because this Will has created the whole Universe, the Cosmos,

15:37.567 --> 15:44.121
this Mother Earth. Everything is created by this Will of God.

15:44.216 --> 15:51.265
So now we are exposed to a new dimension

15:51.360 --> 15:56.010
and that dimension is that we are the ones

15:56.072 --> 16:00.722
who are channels of that Will of God.

16:01.093 --> 16:09.218
So then what is our duty and what should we do about it?

16:09.678 --> 16:14.399
As a result of Sahastrara being opened out,

16:14.490 --> 16:18.121
one thing: the illusions have vanished.

16:20.478 --> 16:23.039
What you call [in] Sanskrit is bhranti.

16:23.439 --> 16:25.232
Illusions have vanished.

16:25.287 --> 16:36.099
You should have no illusion as to the existence of God Almighty,

16:36.980 --> 16:47.233
the power of his Will and the truth about Sahaja Yoga.

16:48.630 --> 16:53.476
You should have no doubts at all,
minimum of minimum should be like that.

16:53.734 --> 16:59.370
But while using this Power you should be aware

16:59.592 --> 17:10.134
that this Power is given to you
because you are capable of handling it.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.250
This is the Highest Power you could think of.

17:14.425 --> 17:21.499
Take any governor, take any minister,
anyone, they can be removed tomorrow.

17:21.721 --> 17:24.065
They can become corrupt.

17:24.105 --> 17:32.192
They can become absolutely devoid of
any knowledge of their own powers.

17:32.344 --> 17:36.673
There are many people who just get elected
without knowing what they have to do.

17:36.832 --> 17:39.753
So this is not just a conversion of people,

17:39.928 --> 17:43.023
it’s not only even transformation,

17:43.293 --> 17:47.794
but it is a new fashioning of a new human being

17:47.959 --> 17:57.077
which has come forward and which is capable
of carrying the Will of God further.

18:09.701 --> 18:14.418
So as a result of your Realisation, what you have got?

18:16.412 --> 18:21.803
The first thing that has happened is that your illusions have gone.

18:22.684 --> 18:27.975
You should have no illusions about God Almighty, His Will

18:28.038 --> 18:37.471
and that He is omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.

18:38.775 --> 18:43.780
All His omnipotence has done this work,

18:43.910 --> 18:47.628
and as a collective consciousness  you should also know that

18:47.645 --> 18:54.081
you are also omnipotent, omnipresent and omniscient.

18:54.666 --> 18:59.492
Omniscient is the thing, that He sees everything, knows everything.

18:59.913 --> 19:04.295
Part of it, that Power, is also within you.

19:04.732 --> 19:11.466
So to prove His omnipresence you have to all the time be aware

19:11.633 --> 19:15.879
that you are sahaja yogis. When I find, even now,

19:16.719 --> 19:20.088
sahaja yogis struggling about their wives, their children,

19:20.113 --> 19:22.562
their house, their jobs,

19:22.626 --> 19:25.584
I start wondering what is their level now?

19:25.609 --> 19:33.848
Where are they?
When are they going to take up the role of what they have got?

19:34.083 --> 19:39.021
So the Omnipotent God who is everywhere,

19:39.259 --> 19:45.002
who has done all this, the Will of God that has worked it out,

19:45.280 --> 19:49.477
has to work through you people and you have to be

19:49.502 --> 19:56.814
very strong, very sensible, very wise, also very effective people.

19:57.877 --> 20:01.998
The more effective you become the more energy you will get.

20:02.133 --> 20:06.897
But still I feel that the sahaja yogis are more,

20:07.001 --> 20:10.433
not taking the responsibility of understanding

20:10.521 --> 20:14.222
that they have to represent this God Almighty

20:14.294 --> 20:20.374
who is omnipresent, omniscient,

20:21.081 --> 20:24.859
who knows everything, who sees everything

20:24.884 --> 20:29.567
and who is potent, means Almighty.

20:32.060 --> 20:37.952
If you understand that this is what has happened
after opening the Sahastrara,

20:37.977 --> 20:44.863
that you have now got the power
which has these three qualities in it.

20:44.888 --> 20:52.007
Say now this big thing has to be supported by a strong pillars,

20:52.164 --> 20:55.831
but supposing if they are not strong, it will fall down.

20:55.966 --> 20:59.747
In the same way such a Great Power which has come to you.

20:59.772 --> 21:02.428
For that we don’t need very successful people,

21:02.476 --> 21:05.276
we don’t need people who have a big name

21:05.301 --> 21:07.108
or those who have lots of money,

21:07.156 --> 21:09.413
what we need [is] people of character,

21:09.508 --> 21:13.700
people of understanding,  of wisdom and of strength,

21:13.725 --> 21:17.790
that “Whatever may come I will stand by it,

21:17.815 --> 21:24.511
I will take to it, I’ll cope with it,
I’ll change myself and improve myself“.

21:37.178 --> 21:44.596
So now illusion has been dispelled.
I hope you all have got rid of your illusions.

21:45.036 --> 21:49.159
Also you should have no illusions about yourself.

21:49.662 --> 21:53.034
If you have any illusions you should leave Sahaja Yoga.

21:53.209 --> 21:59.412
But know that you are chosen for this purpose by God’s Will,

21:59.437 --> 22:03.889
that’s why you are here
and you have to take it up, the responsibility

22:04.112 --> 22:08.690
of understanding of this science which is absolute.

22:08.944 --> 22:15.124
And working it out yourself, for yourself as well as for others.

22:15.769 --> 22:19.372
You have felt My love,

22:19.626 --> 22:24.851
but your love must also be felt, because God is love.

22:25.240 --> 22:27.760
So your love must be felt by others.

22:27.880 --> 22:34.657
Other must feel that you are compassionate,
loving, understanding.

22:34.815 --> 22:39.637
That’s all the time this Will of God is flowing through you.

22:39.923 --> 22:43.168
And you have to work it out in such a manner

22:43.200 --> 22:46.135
that people should know that you are a saint,

22:46.160 --> 22:50.029
that this power is flowing through you.

22:52.213 --> 22:54.846
Then the second thing that has happened to you

22:54.894 --> 22:58.513
is that, not the illusion about God and about yourself,

22:58.870 --> 23:03.679
second thing that has happened –
that you have understood the integration,

23:03.795 --> 23:09.749
that in the world there is complete integration which is existing.

23:13.018 --> 23:20.335
Normally if you see the children,
they have their own natural, innate understanding.

23:20.747 --> 23:24.025
They know. If you see, normally, a good child

23:24.097 --> 23:27.017
would always like to share his things,

23:27.304 --> 23:29.760
would like to love another child,

23:29.848 --> 23:33.776
if there’s another little child is there,
would like to protect that child –

23:33.871 --> 23:40.774
naturally! It won’t think whether it has
black hair or red hair or blue hair.

23:42.104 --> 23:47.915
Naturally, innately a child feels that way.

23:48.518 --> 23:54.320
Also if you take another child, supposing, who is a little baby,

23:54.932 --> 24:02.824
they know that one should be careful about the privacy of the body.

24:03.260 --> 24:07.202
Children don’t want to be made nude before others.

24:07.273 --> 24:11.272
No child likes it. Innately they know.

24:11.661 --> 24:14.684
So all these innate qualities are within you.

24:14.959 --> 24:17.025
Children don’t like to steal anything.

24:17.073 --> 24:20.723
They don’t know what is stealing is.
They have no idea of stealing.

24:22.784 --> 24:29.431
I’ve also seen also children that,
if they go to a place which is very beautiful,

24:29.939 --> 24:35.415
in somebody’s house,
they will always try to keep the beauty of that place.

24:35.518 --> 24:39.515
But if it is already shabby they don’t mind.

24:41.576 --> 24:44.768
So innately all these qualities are there.

24:44.848 --> 24:49.109
I think the countries which are supposed to be
underdeveloped have so many of these

24:49.252 --> 24:54.496
qualities within them, which are innately built within us.

24:54.647 --> 24:57.083
Innocence is innately built.

24:57.131 --> 25:00.258
So the Will of God built up,

25:00.460 --> 25:05.414
first and foremost thing, was innocence, the auspiciousness.

25:05.549 --> 25:09.234
The first thing He did was to create Shri Ganesha,

25:09.619 --> 25:13.742
or I would say, She, because the Will of God is Adi Shakti.

25:14.417 --> 25:20.627
And all this was created first of all to make
the whole world very beautiful.

25:22.357 --> 25:25.645
All these innate qualities were also placed within you.

25:25.792 --> 25:28.458
All those Deities were placed within you.

25:28.570 --> 25:34.113
[They] were specially made, human beings,

25:34.367 --> 25:37.832
that they should become saintly people,

25:37.888 --> 25:41.999
that they should have their saintly, innate sense.

25:42.086 --> 25:45.060
But it happened in the countries which developed,

25:45.219 --> 25:51.893
that our brain was bombarded
by all kinds of television, all kind of things,

25:52.083 --> 26:00.349
and we became very, we can say, we became very vulnerable.

26:00.976 --> 26:06.289
We started getting into the ideas of others.

26:06.479 --> 26:09.604
Anybody who is dominating could dominate us.

26:09.683 --> 26:12.897
It’s not only Hitler who dominated people.

26:13.215 --> 26:19.314
We also see today how much we are dominated,
if you really detach yourself from this world.

26:19.760 --> 26:27.174
For example fashions.
Certain things that come up, people cannot give up at any cost.

26:27.652 --> 26:33.658
They cannot take to something that is sensible
because it’s a fashion.

26:34.158 --> 26:39.314
For example nowadays there’s a fashion,
say to have such a small skirt.

26:39.513 --> 26:42.163
You can’t get a long skirt anywhere.

26:42.338 --> 26:45.909
Everybody has to wear that kind of a skirt

26:46.135 --> 26:50.611
otherwise you are not ‘in’,  you are not in the madhouse!

26:51.540 --> 26:57.389
Now this kind of thing is bombarded on us morning till evening

26:57.461 --> 27:02.348
so, first of all, we become slaves of these entrepreneurs.

27:03.318 --> 27:07.314
Whatever they give us now, I was told that in Belgium
you cannot get anything fresh.

27:07.426 --> 27:12.565
You have to take everything from the supermarket,
which is all tinned.

27:13.073 --> 27:18.603
Gradually what is happening to us –
we are getting absolutely artificial.

27:18.838 --> 27:22.515
The food is artificial, the dress is artificial,

27:22.555 --> 27:25.301
our whole attitude becomes artificial

27:25.429 --> 27:28.950
because we are so much bombarded by advertisement,

27:29.006 --> 27:32.546
by all kinds of outside influences

27:32.644 --> 27:34.397
that we just get lost

27:34.508 --> 27:37.559
and we forget what is our innate sense

27:37.593 --> 27:42.024
which is being dominated by all these modern things.

27:42.444 --> 27:46.364
So adding up to the science also

27:46.451 --> 27:53.004
there is  a big progress in another direction,  that we can call,

27:53.306 --> 27:56.816
the money became very important.

27:57.036 --> 27:59.214
Once money becomes important,

27:59.310 --> 28:03.405
then all your entrepreneurs become important,

28:03.475 --> 28:06.668
because they know how to make money and befool you all the time.

28:06.716 --> 28:09.142
Today you have this thing, tomorrow you have that thing.

28:09.167 --> 28:11.658
Today you change this and have this thing.

28:12.679 --> 28:16.968
But those people who are innately built, they do not change!

28:18.017 --> 28:22.390
They have their dresses of the same type, they do not change.

28:22.747 --> 28:26.782
On the contrary they find it very difficult to get out of

28:26.885 --> 28:31.134
their traditional achievements and they don’t want to change themselves.

28:31.404 --> 28:34.669
So for sahaja yogis it is important to see and watch

28:34.757 --> 28:40.544
if they are getting this slavery from
the entrepreneurs in modern times.

28:41.000 --> 28:48.287
Then, the thoughts.
So many books we read, which gives you thoughts,

28:48.533 --> 28:56.327
which are some mad rambling,
I would say, of some madman, like Freud.

28:56.811 --> 28:59.967
How could Freud influence the West?

29:00.166 --> 29:07.107
Because you have lost your innate sense and you accepted.

29:08.900 --> 29:15.684
You accepted that and that’s how Freud became your,
sort of a, Jesus Christ.

29:16.173 --> 29:18.717
He became the most important thing.

29:18.773 --> 29:26.377
Sex became the most important thing. I mean it’s so simple.

29:26.476 --> 29:29.388
With little common sense you can understand

29:29.518 --> 29:36.832
that, at every moment, we are put into this kind of a

29:43.708 --> 29:49.432
of a domination by these few

29:49.616 --> 29:53.909
domineering people who have certain ideas,
and they put forward.

29:54.235 --> 29:59.268
Anybody puts any idea. For example,
Sade (the Marquis de Sade) or Sartre or anyone.

29:59.665 --> 30:03.454
That idea starts becoming “Oh he said it“.
Who is he?

30:03.526 --> 30:07.854
What is his life?
Just see for yourself what sort of a man he is.

30:07.912 --> 30:12.100
With little common sense.
But with your will that you have now,

30:12.355 --> 30:16.497
Will of God, which has fashioned the whole world,
which has fashioned you.

30:16.522 --> 30:21.634
Every cell within you has been fashioned by God Almighty

30:21.753 --> 30:26.803
and what you are doing is to play
into the hands of these entrepreneurs.

30:27.191 --> 30:34.121
They have realised that these vulnerable people are very good for

30:34.526 --> 30:44.614
having as their disciples,  I should say,
to make money, to befool them.

30:45.131 --> 30:50.777
Now on this side, you have such a Great Power,

30:51.880 --> 30:54.835
you are chosen for a, such a great thing,

30:54.946 --> 31:00.928
and on the other side you have this kind of slavery.

31:03.919 --> 31:08.534
So try to understand that your innate qualities were lost.

31:08.646 --> 31:13.576
But luckily, by the Kundalini awakening
and by the breaking of the Sahastrara,

31:13.703 --> 31:17.804
all these innate qualities which looked like lost:

31:17.851 --> 31:21.389
like your innocence, like your creativity,

31:21.612 --> 31:28.911
like your religion within, like your compassion

31:29.727 --> 31:39.623
and love for the humanity ,
like your power of judgment, wisdom.

31:39.925 --> 31:44.476
All these great qualities which we thought were lost were nothing

31:44.602 --> 31:48.095
but they were in a dormant state.

31:48.233 --> 31:51.174
They all got awakened one by one.

31:51.223 --> 31:54.064
I don’t have to tell you “Don’t drink this!

31:54.223 --> 31:57.079
Don’t eat this! Don’t do that!”.

31:57.151 --> 32:01.417
You yourself realise that this is wrong.

32:01.940 --> 32:05.127
You yourself know what is good for you.

32:05.223 --> 32:08.627
And still if you want to do wrong you can go ahead.

32:09.167 --> 32:13.349
But already there is a light within you to see for yourself

32:13.421 --> 32:15.413
what is good and what is bad.

32:15.438 --> 32:19.911
It has come because of this Sahastrara being opened out

32:19.945 --> 32:22.950
to this – a new dimension of new knowledge.

32:23.022 --> 32:26.484
And this is not new, it is all innately built within you.

32:26.509 --> 32:32.406
Now all those innate qualities are manifesting
and you are enjoying them.

32:34.627 --> 32:39.042
So now you have to get out of your petty ideas and petty things.

32:39.766 --> 32:42.408
People are reporting to Me something very funny –

32:42.433 --> 32:44.698
I can’t believe sahaja yogis can do like that –

32:44.723 --> 32:47.782
that they run away with the plates that I have bought,

32:47.830 --> 32:51.483
or they run away with the cups, they throw things here and there,

32:51.554 --> 32:53.891
all over the places they are throwing things.

32:53.963 --> 32:56.478
How can you behave like this?

32:57.542 --> 33:01.020
I mean this is so stupid and so insipid.

33:01.132 --> 33:05.340
If you do not have a proper discipline of life yourself,

33:05.475 --> 33:09.074
you cannot carry the Will of God, you cannot.

33:09.146 --> 33:13.808
But I’m not going to tell you “Do this or do that!”

33:13.935 --> 33:16.809
I respect your freedom

33:17.841 --> 33:23.896
and I just want that your own Kundalini should awaken
that wisdom in you,

33:24.063 --> 33:27.172
that greatness in you, that glory in you

33:27.259 --> 33:31.659
and you start understanding what is our innate quality.

33:32.778 --> 33:34.897
So it will purify you.

33:35.008 --> 33:37.460
Once you are purified completely, like

33:37.526 --> 33:40.284
you see, if you have some gold which is not pure

33:40.316 --> 33:45.251
you put it in the fire,  the gold is separated.

33:45.276 --> 33:50.140
In the same way, the fire of Kundalini cleanses you completely,

33:50.236 --> 33:52.618
makes you absolutely clean,

33:52.663 --> 34:00.283
and you start seeing your own glory,
your own nature, your own greatness.

34:00.466 --> 34:06.297
So the integration part comes to you easily.
You start integrating.

34:06.861 --> 34:14.795
First of all, we used to have sahaja yogis, say from,

34:14.849 --> 34:19.338
some from England, some from Spain, some from here.

34:19.350 --> 34:23.235
They would always have different groups,
they would never sit together.

34:23.448 --> 34:25.949
You could make out this is English sitting here,

34:26.044 --> 34:30.895
they are sitting here, they are sitting here,
and they would form a group.

34:31.149 --> 34:38.061
But now it’s not so. Now I find they all are becoming integrated.

34:38.331 --> 34:46.287
The integration of human beings is
the most important thing for Sahaja Yoga.

34:47.573 --> 34:52.900
That comes by understanding, not by your intelligence,

34:53.027 --> 34:59.184
but by innate understanding that –
all human beings are made by God,

34:59.287 --> 35:04.953
by His will, and we have no right to despise anyone.

35:05.869 --> 35:11.920
The second integration that has come within you is that all religions,

35:12.317 --> 35:19.516
all religions, are born on the same tree of spiritual life.

35:21.310 --> 35:27.352
That all religions are to be worshipped, all incarnations,

35:27.448 --> 35:34.664
all prophets, all scriptures are to be worshipped.

35:34.823 --> 35:40.798
There are defects, there are problems with
those scriptures which can be corrected.

35:41.520 --> 35:46.840
So gradually you start entering into the subtler side of Divinity,

35:46.919 --> 35:51.257
to understand that all these people have worked hard

35:51.395 --> 35:54.452
to create, today, the atmosphere for Sahaja Yoga,

35:54.540 --> 35:59.740
and no religion is to be despised,
and no religion is to be attacked,

35:59.867 --> 36:06.680
which is a very, very, absolutely a unreal thing

36:06.847 --> 36:12.902
and you are working out a very unreal theory

36:12.974 --> 36:16.966
which doesn’t exist in the Divine plan.

36:17.084 --> 36:20.922
So this is how we finish all fundamentalism.

36:21.312 --> 36:24.248
Fundamentalists are the ones who believed that

36:24.335 --> 36:27.358
this is written in this book, this is written in this book,

36:27.444 --> 36:31.910
and that we, because we read this book, we are something better.

36:32.014 --> 36:35.284
Anybody can read any book, what is so great?

36:35.680 --> 36:39.759
Same, I would say, in Sahaja Yoga people
should not become fundamentalist.

36:39.823 --> 36:41.346
Be very careful!

36:41.489 --> 36:44.237
Because that’s what you are – born like that, I mean,

36:44.365 --> 36:46.880
I don’t know, it’s not your innate quality  but

36:46.959 --> 36:50.876
the way you are made that way,
you have fashioned yourself that way,

36:51.083 --> 36:55.525
that you start also making Sahaja Yoga sometimes a fundamental.

36:55.573 --> 36:57.517
“Mother said so.”

36:57.620 --> 37:00.199
Do not use Me anywhere!

37:00.295 --> 37:04.422
“Mother said so!” Is a way you want to dominate others.

37:05.726 --> 37:11.043
You yourself say because now you have a right,
you have an individuality in Sahaja Yoga.

37:11.225 --> 37:14.221
You can say what you have to say yourself,

37:14.404 --> 37:17.450
but don’t say that “Mother has said it!”

37:17.569 --> 37:21.213
Because anybody can start it, like that: “Christ said it!”.

37:21.309 --> 37:27.043
A clergyman or, a say, pope can stand up on his

37:27.297 --> 37:32.446
own platform  and say that Christ has said it.

37:33.679 --> 37:37.484
They can just arbitrarily use all these things.

37:37.625 --> 37:41.821
So nobody has business to use Me arbitrarily.

37:41.925 --> 37:44.503
Whatever you have to say you say yourself.

37:44.551 --> 37:48.218
But don’t ever quote Me as that: “Mother has said it,”

37:48.321 --> 37:52.641
or, “In this book such and such is written,
so this is the line, that is important.

37:52.741 --> 37:57.170
” You are not bound by any line, by whatever I say.

37:57.234 --> 38:02.578
It is you who has to stand up and see for yourself
what you have to say,

38:02.785 --> 38:06.127
because you have to use now your will

38:06.985 --> 38:15.624
and for that you have to develop yourself to have Pure Will,
the Pure Desire of God Almighty.

38:16.505 --> 38:20.624
The integration not only outward, but inward.

38:20.704 --> 38:26.897
Like first of all, whatever we did, our mind used to say one thing,

38:27.000 --> 38:31.832
our heart used to say another thing,
our brain used to say another thing.

38:32.277 --> 38:38.229
Now what has happened that all these 3 things have become one.

38:38.501 --> 38:45.237
So, whatever your brain says is absolutely acceptable to your heart,

38:45.555 --> 38:48.340
absolutely acceptable to your attention.

38:49.063 --> 38:52.352
So you yourself, you have become now integrated.

38:52.712 --> 38:56.011
Many people write “Mother I want to do it, but I can’t do it,”

38:56.138 --> 39:00.283
“Mother it was my desire to do it, but I can’t do it.” Not now.

39:00.442 --> 39:07.274
Now you are completely integrated
and you can easily do the whole thing very well.

39:07.893 --> 39:16.046
If you want to examine yourself,
you should try to find out “Am I integrated or not?

39:16.228 --> 39:19.688
Whatever I’m doing, am I doing with my full heart or not,

39:19.782 --> 39:21.997
with my full attention or not?”

39:22.092 --> 39:27.330
I’ve seen that you do with full heart and full intelligence

39:27.426 --> 39:30.044
but full attention is not there.

39:30.576 --> 39:35.553
Still the attention, which is the first thing
that was enlightened, is not fully used.

39:35.823 --> 39:43.809
So the whole attention should be absolutely there,

39:44.031 --> 39:48.594
that, “I have to do this thing with full attention.”

39:49.079 --> 39:53.772
Otherwise, the integration is not complete, integration is partial.

39:54.161 --> 39:59.497
So these three things have to be completely integrated.

40:07.237 --> 40:11.916
So the integration of all the chakras comes in.

40:12.004 --> 40:15.392
Like whatever you do, has to be auspicious.

40:16.234 --> 40:20.297
Whatever you do has to be with full attention.

40:21.317 --> 40:25.568
Whatever you do has to be absolutely religious.

40:26.838 --> 40:32.183
So like that, all these centres are being absolutely,

40:32.223 --> 40:37.604
one integrated power that you have.

40:37.835 --> 40:40.096
So the whole life should be integrated.

40:40.151 --> 40:43.019
Now, say somebody’s husband is not that level

40:43.067 --> 40:47.455
or somebody’s wife is not of that level,  you shouldn’t bother.

40:47.606 --> 40:53.301
You should just bother about yourself.
Don’t expect anything from anybody else.

40:53.491 --> 40:58.337
It is your duty which is important.
You have to fulfill your duty

40:58.464 --> 41:01.415
and you have to work it out yourself.

41:01.495 --> 41:07.322
Unless and until you understand that it is your individual being

41:07.806 --> 41:12.605
which has achieved it,
and it’s the individual being which has to realise it,

41:12.732 --> 41:18.422
is the individual being that has to become one,
integrated with the rest of them.

41:18.691 --> 41:22.180
If you start putting things, like many a times I’ve seen

41:22.236 --> 41:25.179
[that] if I say something people start thinking

41:25.227 --> 41:29.327
that I am saying for somebody else, they never take it for themselves.

41:30.882 --> 41:36.387
So,not we have to see what is my gain: “I’ve got financial gain" say

41:36.458 --> 41:42.088
“I’ve got physical gains,
I’ve got mental gains, I’ve got joy, happiness”

41:42.113 --> 41:45.439
that’s not the only thing.

41:47.534 --> 41:50.375
That should not be the only criteria.

41:50.518 --> 41:55.782
But what you should have is the understanding

41:56.378 --> 42:03.134
of your own personality which is being specially fashioned

42:03.308 --> 42:10.516
[through] many, many lives for you
to come in this life to get your Realisation,

42:10.841 --> 42:16.609
to do the further work of Will of God.

42:19.546 --> 42:25.028
Every moment when you see a miracle taking place, you do realise

42:25.108 --> 42:27.452
that it’s all done by Paramchaitanya.

42:27.508 --> 42:31.651
But what is Paramchaitanya – is the will of Adi Shakti.

42:31.976 --> 42:35.222
And what is Adi Shakti – is the Will of God.

42:36.615 --> 42:44.143
So, is all, whatever is done, is all ‘fixed entities’,
we can call them,

42:44.336 --> 42:52.061
or these vibrations are like, we can say, DNA tapes.

42:52.475 --> 42:57.109
They all know how they have to fashion you.

42:57.746 --> 43:00.634
See, today it’s very sunny.

43:00.674 --> 43:04.031
Everybody is surprised how can they have.

43:04.062 --> 43:06.678
So many things happen like this.

43:06.734 --> 43:09.908
The other day, we had havan, it was absolutely sunny.

43:10.127 --> 43:12.769
So the whole Cosmos is working for you.

43:12.857 --> 43:16.323
You are on the stage now and you have to see to it,

43:16.411 --> 43:19.815
but if you don’t have faith in yourself,

43:20.156 --> 43:27.095
if you are not confident as to what you are, how can you help?

43:28.581 --> 43:35.754
How can you work out yourself
and work out all the problems of the world,

43:35.858 --> 43:38.386
which are created only by human beings?

43:38.474 --> 43:45.829
So we have to absolutely overthrow all these dominations on us.

43:46.146 --> 43:50.461
First from science. We can prove everything that Sahaja Yoga,

43:50.523 --> 43:54.101
whatever it has said about science, has been proved.

43:54.284 --> 43:59.408
So, we can throw science which is just always,

43:59.469 --> 44:02.425
all the time, in the flux, it’s changing all the time.

44:02.504 --> 44:05.191
Then the so-called religions that we have.

44:05.279 --> 44:10.162
So-called religions because people who have been Catholics,

44:10.187 --> 44:14.882
who have been Protestants, who have been Hindus
or Muslims, or this and that,

44:15.088 --> 44:18.326
they all have got that thing on their heads.

44:18.533 --> 44:20.866
And this has to be thrown away.

44:21.120 --> 44:24.132
We have to become a new personality.

44:24.339 --> 44:29.831
After Realisation, as I said,
you become like a lotuses is from the mud.

44:31.259 --> 44:33.900
So now you have become lotuses and the lotuses

44:33.925 --> 44:37.154
have to throw away all this dead mud,

44:37.205 --> 44:40.149
otherwise fragrance won’t be there.

44:40.429 --> 44:42.214
That, one has to achieve:

44:42.325 --> 44:48.527
is to throw away all these shackles
which are, which are killing you,

44:54.996 --> 45:01.492
which are of no use, but a burden.

45:02.254 --> 45:05.087
And beautiful lotuses as you are

45:05.242 --> 45:10.895
you have to understand that
the whole fashioning has been done so carefully,

45:10.958 --> 45:17.071
with such sweetness, with such delicacy.

45:18.946 --> 45:22.808
So first of all we must have respect for ourselves,

45:23.277 --> 45:27.215
we must have affection and love for others

45:28.104 --> 45:33.604
and we must have respect, means we must have discipline.

45:34.589 --> 45:36.612
We have to have the discipline

45:37.416 --> 45:41.611
because if you respect yourself you’ll definitely discipline yourself

45:41.731 --> 45:43.683
and you’ll make it available.

45:45.162 --> 45:51.606
Now as you can realise, that from My life itself,

45:51.765 --> 45:57.515
that I work very hard, travel a lot,
much more than any one of you can do.

45:57.689 --> 46:05.828
Because I have the will that – I have to bring this world

46:06.510 --> 46:11.532
to that state of enjoyment, to that state of happiness,

46:11.811 --> 46:15.932
to that state of Divinity, where they realise

46:16.106 --> 46:21.883
what is their glory, what is the glory of their Father.

46:22.596 --> 46:26.556
So I work very hard and I never even think

46:26.660 --> 46:28.935
that something will go wrong with Me,

46:28.991 --> 46:31.459
or “This will happen”,  “What will happen?”

46:31.575 --> 46:34.462
I never have bothered you about My family life,

46:34.541 --> 46:37.195
about My children, about anyone.

46:37.231 --> 46:40.996
Whatever problems I had, I am dealing with them Myself.

46:41.203 --> 46:44.464
But here I get such big, big letters from sahaja yogis,

46:44.691 --> 46:49.579
writing about their daughter, their son, this thing, that thing.

46:49.762 --> 46:54.670
Another thing is attachment to family is
the biggest burden on your heads

46:54.761 --> 46:58.686
and all the time you are worried about your children,

46:58.711 --> 47:01.406
you are worried about this, you are worried about that.

47:01.549 --> 47:03.484
That’s not your responsibility.

47:05.037 --> 47:06.592
Please try to understand.

47:06.799 --> 47:10.219
That’s the responsibility of God Almighty.

47:10.724 --> 47:13.650
You can’t do better than Him can you?

47:14.226 --> 47:18.173
But when you try to take the responsibility
He says “All right, look after!”

47:18.198 --> 47:20.347
and the problems start.

47:22.459 --> 47:27.146
‘Detachment’ is the word one should understand in a proper sense.

47:27.757 --> 47:30.405
When I ask people why do you throw things here and there, say

47:30.429 --> 47:32.730
“We are detached!”- wonderful way!

47:33.983 --> 47:37.251
And what about your children? You cling on to them.

47:37.746 --> 47:40.683
What about your own things? You cling on to them.

47:40.717 --> 47:43.776
For a small little thing, they’ll bother My head.

47:44.189 --> 47:48.723
And, when it belongs to Me or to Sahaja Yoga,

47:48.818 --> 47:51.973
then they’ll have a very nice time with it –

47:52.078 --> 47:54.293
and throw it away,  wherever they feel like.

47:54.318 --> 47:56.940
I mean this kind of irresponsibility!

47:57.687 --> 48:00.173
How can you call them divine?

48:00.575 --> 48:02.821
How can they be saintly people?

48:03.051 --> 48:08.478
Saintly people not only are responsible for themselves,
but for everyone.

48:09.963 --> 48:16.332
Very slowly, smoothly, sweetly, with great affection,

48:16.621 --> 48:18.933
I have brought you to this level.

48:19.323 --> 48:22.703
I didn’t ask you to go to Himalayas or stand on your heads

48:22.802 --> 48:26.646
or to donate all your properties to Me.
Nothing of the kind.

48:28.365 --> 48:32.391
We have managed it in a very, very beautiful manner.

48:32.812 --> 48:35.512
Now further, when you have to go further,

48:36.474 --> 48:40.257
then you have to understand that your duties

48:40.305 --> 48:43.394
are to be fulfilled by you and by nobody else.

48:43.856 --> 48:48.845
But these duties are done by you,

48:48.902 --> 48:55.121
are towards your family, towards your house,
towards this, towards that.

48:56.367 --> 48:59.287
No duties towards Sahaja Yoga.

49:02.898 --> 49:07.899
So when you were, before Sahaja Yoga,
you were not attached to anyone,

49:08.073 --> 49:11.524
in the sense – you were only attached to yourself, self-centered.

49:11.549 --> 49:14.270
Now you have widened yourself a little more,

49:14.295 --> 49:17.433
that now you are attached to your wife, to your children.

49:17.672 --> 49:20.259
But that’s just the same.

49:20.406 --> 49:26.303
That is also selfish, because they are your children, you think.

49:26.441 --> 49:31.351
They are not your children, they are the children of God.

49:31.872 --> 49:35.826
I hope all of you are intelligent enough to understand

49:36.224 --> 49:40.691
your responsibility and work it out.

49:41.980 --> 49:45.511
This is a very important thing that has happened to you

49:45.743 --> 49:47.798
that Sahastrara has opened.

49:47.904 --> 49:51.474
Now you can prove the existence of God,

49:51.514 --> 49:55.228
His Will, everything, to the whole world.

49:55.587 --> 49:58.515
Nobody can challenge Sahaja Yoga.

49:58.574 --> 50:02.430
Those scientist who will challenge can be told.

50:02.707 --> 50:07.444
Anybody, whether you’re a scientist, economist, politician, anything,

50:07.863 --> 50:13.016
everything can be explained in the light of Sahaja Yoga

50:13.128 --> 50:17.416
and can be proved that there’s only one politics –that is of God,

50:17.527 --> 50:20.105
one economics – that is of God,

50:20.153 --> 50:26.241
and there is only one religion –
that is of God,  is Vishwa Nirmala Dharma.

50:26.988 --> 50:28.757
It can be proved,

50:29.117 --> 50:34.076
there’s nothing to be afraid of or to worry about.

50:34.381 --> 50:37.341
This all can be proved to the scientist and

50:37.365 --> 50:42.840
to the other intellectuals and to some few people

50:43.015 --> 50:44.387
if they want to listen to us.

50:44.412 --> 50:46.920
If they don’t want to listen to us, forget it.

50:46.999 --> 50:49.652
Because we are so powerful, why should you worry about them?

50:49.720 --> 50:51.703
But, if they are willing to listen to us,

50:51.746 --> 50:57.295
then is better that we tell them
“Now we have discovered this Great Power”,

50:57.581 --> 50:59.972
and if it works out,

51:00.068 --> 51:02.710
if this Great Power works out

51:02.877 --> 51:07.591
then only we can really fashion the whole world in a new way.

51:07.669 --> 51:11.295
I have great hopes from you people,

51:11.592 --> 51:14.417
but the seriousness with which you should take Sahaja Yoga,

51:14.457 --> 51:18.432
for example even meditation, people don’t do.

51:19.719 --> 51:23.524
Simple thing like meditation,
you people don’t do,  I can’t understand.

51:23.612 --> 51:26.000
How will you grow without meditation?

51:26.516 --> 51:32.161
Unless and until you become thoughtlessly aware you cannot grow.

51:32.409 --> 51:37.427
So you have to, you have to at least meditate morning, evening.

51:37.566 --> 51:41.561
There are many people who are not even collective by temperament.

51:41.620 --> 51:45.669
If they are staying in an ashram
they just think that ashram life is no good.

51:45.694 --> 51:48.550
Such people should really get out of Sahaja Yoga,

51:49.358 --> 51:52.539
because they have not yet understood what this Sahaja Yoga is.

51:52.809 --> 51:55.190
Without collectivity how will you grow?

51:55.839 --> 51:57.918
How will you assemble your power? You see?

51:58.024 --> 52:02.485
You know very well that in a sangha, in a group,

52:02.660 --> 52:07.191
in combining together only, you can be strong.

52:07.457 --> 52:11.101
Is a fact that if you have one stick you can break it,

52:11.157 --> 52:14.823
but if you put many sticks together you cannot break it.

52:14.945 --> 52:19.766
But there are still people
I know who are still not so much in collectivity.

52:19.967 --> 52:24.682
Shows how poor they are in their understanding of their own Self,

52:24.854 --> 52:26.611
and they are telling Me that “Mother,

52:26.643 --> 52:30.849
we don’t want to stay in the Ashram  now anywhere more.”

52:30.915 --> 52:33.478
So they should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

52:34.584 --> 52:37.003
Without the collectivity, you cannot grow.

52:37.019 --> 52:40.368
Without the discipline of Sahaja Yoga, you cannot grow.

52:40.722 --> 52:45.808
It’s better to have ten people of good quality
than to have thousand useless people.

52:46.422 --> 52:48.572
That’s what is the Will of God.

52:48.763 --> 52:52.738
So now, as you are today here,  so many people,

52:52.770 --> 52:56.310
I am really enamoured  to see so many people are there.

52:56.548 --> 53:01.295
And we have done so much of our growth

53:01.320 --> 53:06.022
and grown out of all those
nonsensical things that we were following.

53:06.546 --> 53:11.161
But today we have to take a vow

53:11.535 --> 53:17.851
that –  “I’ll now fashion my life according to the Will of God.

53:17.877 --> 53:21.016
Absolutely. And dedicate myself to that.”

53:21.041 --> 53:25.065
No family, no other considerations.

53:25.098 --> 53:28.105
Just forget it! Nothing so important.

53:28.410 --> 53:31.532
Everything can be looked after by Will of God.

53:31.779 --> 53:35.215
So if you just try to follow the Will of God,

53:35.248 --> 53:37.595
your children will be looked after,

53:37.619 --> 53:42.103
everything will be looked after,
you don’t have to worry for anything.

53:42.559 --> 53:44.003
And that works.

53:44.090 --> 53:47.479
Just try to understand that you have problems

53:47.504 --> 53:50.466
because you don’t want to give those problems to God,

53:50.491 --> 53:53.303
you want to keep it to themselves, that’s why you have problems.

53:53.360 --> 53:55.430
If you decide that “No,

53:55.872 --> 54:01.413
I just want to give these problems to the God’s will,” Finished!

54:02.543 --> 54:07.182
Also there are some who want to say that “We are not so capable

54:07.262 --> 54:12.571
Mother, we can’t do it.”
Saying like this also is stupid.

54:14.167 --> 54:18.084
You test yourself, you see for yourself.

54:18.934 --> 54:22.997
So first of all, one has to understand why do we say such a thing?

54:23.577 --> 54:26.736
Maybe that we are very money-oriented,

54:26.948 --> 54:31.063
that we want to have money to ourselves, or something like that.

54:31.274 --> 54:35.472
Or some people are there who talk of business also in Sahaja Yoga.

54:35.746 --> 54:39.153
There must be something like a money orientation,

54:39.319 --> 54:41.753
or some sort of a material attachment

54:41.801 --> 54:45.808
that they say that ‘We are not capable,
we cannot change.”

54:46.249 --> 54:49.989
The second could be this mamatwa as they call it.

54:50.037 --> 54:54.986
The attachment to your family, children, this, that.

54:55.415 --> 54:58.073
Or, ‘This is mine, this is mine,this is mine.”

54:58.356 --> 55:00.789
This could be the second reason

55:00.932 --> 55:04.833
that you think that you are not bold enough

55:04.858 --> 55:09.367
or you are not strong enough to do Sahaja Yoga.

55:09.551 --> 55:15.596
Thirdly could be that you are still playing with your old habits

55:16.088 --> 55:21.048
and that you are enjoying your life without virtues.

55:21.974 --> 55:24.139
There can be some reason like that.

55:24.195 --> 55:28.051
So just try to locate, “Why am I behaving like this?

55:28.156 --> 55:33.180
Why am I not getting into the same

55:33.276 --> 55:40.025
beautiful path of my ascent as everybody has got it.”

55:40.668 --> 55:45.283
If we introspect, you’ll find out that
"There’s something wrong with me

55:45.730 --> 55:48.671
that I think I am not capable of doing.”

55:48.767 --> 55:51.925
You are capable of doing everything!

55:52.378 --> 55:55.795
You just try this and enjoy it.

55:57.090 --> 56:05.090
So, most important thing now [that]
remains is that you should become a

56:05.963 --> 56:11.045
proper, strong, compassionate vehicle of God’s Will.

56:11.585 --> 56:15.458
So. Then, what is most important of course,

56:15.489 --> 56:19.704
I agree, that you do My puja,
because that helps you a lot, no doubt.

56:19.729 --> 56:22.637
But other things are not important.

56:25.003 --> 56:29.288
So many other things you people tell Me is not of importance.

56:30.374 --> 56:35.603
Main thing is that you should all ascend higher and higher

56:36.155 --> 56:42.066
and compete with each other in getting into higher situation.

56:42.645 --> 56:48.424
As it is, I think in such a short time
we have achieved a lot, no doubt,

56:48.503 --> 56:52.326
but still we have to speed up and work it out.

56:52.536 --> 56:57.870
I am sure that this new science,
or we can say, the, which is the

56:58.476 --> 57:02.257
absolute science will one day outshadow

57:02.392 --> 57:05.984
the other science, and tell people that: this is what it is.

57:06.009 --> 57:08.882
It is in your hands, you work it out.

57:09.714 --> 57:13.846
So today is the day we are celebrate by which

57:13.902 --> 57:18.639
we have opened absolutely a new dimension,

57:20.445 --> 57:28.134
absolutely a venue of great Divinity,

57:28.285 --> 57:31.775
of the proofs of Divine.

57:31.855 --> 57:41.250
And this is something so great that we can really finish

57:41.275 --> 57:46.602
all the illusions they have about themselves, about their ego.

57:46.729 --> 57:48.572
We can manage them.

57:48.652 --> 57:51.771
That power you all have.

57:53.062 --> 57:58.030
May God Bless You.
