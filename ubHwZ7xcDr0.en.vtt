00:00:29.731 --> 00:00:41.086
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.
Speaking before the doctors,

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:49.309
I think of My college days while I was also
studying Medicine but luckily or unluckily,

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:58.751
our college stopped completely, in Lahore
and I had to give up My studies.

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:09.851
Not that I had no faith in this Western education
of Medicine, but it was a good chance by

00:01:09.851 --> 00:01:18.621
connecting this to that and understanding what
is missing in the Western Medical education.

00:01:23.949 --> 00:01:38.279
The missing point is this, that human beings
are considered, in the Medical Science, as

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:46.393
something very individual and not connected
with the Whole. We are all connected

00:01:46.393 --> 00:01:54.176
with the Whole but how to convince people
that you are all connected with the Whole

00:01:57.244 --> 00:02:09.034
and that you are not singled out. As we are
connected with the Whole, all our problems

00:02:09.034 --> 00:02:16.579
are connected with the Whole. We cannot
just consider somebody as the patient of

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:23.830
one thing and another, patient of another
thing. Could be, that one person who has

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:32.854
one trouble, could be having so many other
troubles, so many other connections which

00:02:32.854 --> 00:02:43.738
we do not locate in the Western Medical
Science. For example, you see a person

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:56.300
medically very sick, maybe, but you don't
know what is his mental condition, what is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:05.771
he doing mentally? Is he alright mentally or
only he is physically something wrong with him?

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:18.755
Now, actually we know about so many things
like say, medically we have names for that.

00:03:19.683 --> 00:03:29.973
We say that, this is a Psychosomatic problem
or this is a Somatic problem but what is

00:03:29.973 --> 00:03:37.378
the relationship between the two that we
don't know. You'll be amazed, most of our

00:03:37.378 --> 00:03:45.876
diseases come from Psychosomatic, like
Cancer - which are incurable mostly - Cancer

00:03:47.782 --> 00:03:58.932
and we can say, AIDS; All such which are
supposed to be absolutely incurable and difficult,

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:06.059
all of them come with our connection, with
our connection, which we are not sure of,

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:12.168
with the left side as we - you've seen here
in the picture, left side. I don't know -

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:23.030
we know only the right side Medical Science
and that too in such details - it is not necessary.

00:04:25.584 --> 00:04:34.204
You must also know the left side of a human
and about left side we are absolutely not aware.

00:04:36.954 --> 00:04:45.964
For example, a person who is a mad
- he's in the lunatic asylum

00:04:49.354 --> 00:04:52.194
- he doesn't get's heart trouble, why?

00:04:59.075 --> 00:05:15.105
How has he got mad, what is his connection
with ourselves? For example, you take a patient,

00:05:15.384 --> 00:05:24.964
who is suffering, say from cancer. We know
a lot about cancer, no doubt. How virus

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:33.135
has started and all that, that we know
but how cancer is caused, no one knows and

00:05:33.135 --> 00:05:41.068
to what type of people cancer comes in, 
you don't know. Now these are two, as you

00:05:41.068 --> 00:05:48.745
see, they are two channels within us. 
One looks after the right side and one

00:05:48.745 --> 00:05:58.901
looks after the left side. Now if you have
a problem in the left side, then problems

00:05:59.946 --> 00:06:09.726
Psychosomatic can come in. Supposing, your
hand is broken or is there some sort of a

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:18.175
physical problem, then it's alright but when
it is the complicated Psychosomatic trouble,

00:06:18.528 --> 00:06:25.968
then doctors cannot cure it, I'm sorry to say,
because you don't know the other side of it.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:35.980
What is affecting the patient to get this 
cancer, you don't know. You'll be happy to know,

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:46.666
in Sahaja yoga cancer is curable. Curable,
if it is at a very early stage, is very easy

00:06:46.666 --> 00:07:00.266
but otherwise also, specially Blood Cancer
is absolutely curable. You be amazed that

00:07:00.266 --> 00:07:11.658
it is such a combination of these two sides
of our life that we get into these diseases,

00:07:11.658 --> 00:07:17.108
which are incurable. There's a big list
of these incurable diseases which I don't

00:07:17.108 --> 00:07:24.113
want to tell you, which you know very well.
So in all of them, there is a complication

00:07:24.113 --> 00:07:30.863
of the left side. Of course you know about
right side very much - Gray's anatomy and

00:07:30.863 --> 00:07:38.767
after that all you know but you don't know
how you get affected by the left side.

00:07:40.045 --> 00:07:46.565
So in this lecture, I would like to tell
you something about the left side, which

00:07:46.565 --> 00:07:55.556
you have never heard of, maybe, and you 
don't believe into. The left side belongs

00:07:55.556 --> 00:08:07.462
to our past. To our past in the sense, that
those people who are futuristic, do not get

00:08:07.462 --> 00:08:13.240
affected by the left side but those people
who live in the left side, are worried

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:21.164
about their left side, are sorry for themselves
- whatever it is - they are ones who get affected.

00:08:25.165 --> 00:08:32.315
Left sided person, if I tell you you'll be
shocked to hear, is actually possessed,

00:08:33.635 --> 00:08:41.205
possessed by some dead spirit, which must
be a knowledge to you. You may not be

00:08:41.205 --> 00:08:53.586
believing in it but it is true. It can happen
to anyone, who gets sad or gets into the left

00:08:53.586 --> 00:09:01.688
sided temperament. Also there are so many
other things, like these false gurus.

00:09:02.362 --> 00:09:09.282
What they do, they mesmerize. They mesmerize
you with these dead spirits, which they have

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:19.332
to control. This side of, I should say not
Medicine, non Medicine but whatever it is,

00:09:19.332 --> 00:09:27.649
should be known to the doctors otherwise
you cannot do any curing. You can, maybe

00:09:27.649 --> 00:09:34.420
diagnosis you might do but you cannot cure
people who are suffering from Psychosomatic

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:43.541
troubles. Today's medical problem is that
they cannot cure Psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:45.577 --> 00:09:51.897
For that, you don't have to spend so many
years as we do for MBBS. It's a very, very

00:09:51.897 --> 00:10:00.304
short course, if you can do that but for
that firstly, you should be connected to

00:10:00.304 --> 00:10:07.561
the Divine force. That's very important.
That's not difficult at all but after that

00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:17.630
you have to maintain your spiritual abilities.
One of the spiritual ability is innocence.

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:30.599
The first chakra that you see, is innocence.
If you are a innocent person, they can,

00:10:31.007 --> 00:10:38.717
you can easily cure all such people who
are suffering from such incurable diseases.

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:50.540
I would say that, one should first of all try
to get Self-realization, that's important.

00:10:50.675 --> 00:10:57.035
When the Kundalini rises, She pierces through
your fontanel bone area and you are connected

00:10:57.035 --> 00:11:04.432
with the Divine force, which is all over. You need
not believe Me but you get your Self-realization.

00:11:05.247 --> 00:11:12.217
If you have your Self-realization, then
you'll be capable to understand what

00:11:12.217 --> 00:11:22.880
sort of combination your patient has.
Is he only physically suffering or he has

00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:32.523
this combination of left side. The other
day I was surprised, a child came to Me.

00:11:33.532 --> 00:11:44.542
He was suffering from Meningitis. He got
cured and the parents didn't understand

00:11:44.542 --> 00:11:52.378
how did he get cured. Then when the boy got
cured, I asked him, "Who is your friend?"

00:11:53.828 --> 00:12:02.838
He said, "This particular boy who has a
particular guru." Alright, "And I go in his

00:12:02.838 --> 00:12:07.924
house and go on watching that guru
all the time." Can you imagine?

00:12:09.510 --> 00:12:20.070
There are many doctors also who get involved
in these bad gurus. You must know, unless and

00:12:20.070 --> 00:12:28.135
until you are realized, you will not know
who is truthful and who is correct.

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:39.442
An innocent boy is suffering from meningitis
and overnight he got cured. You'll be amazed

00:12:39.442 --> 00:12:51.776
at the great experience of Sahaja yoga
and it is too great a surprise, that's why

00:12:51.776 --> 00:12:58.961
people don't accept it but we have many
cases by which we can show, that people

00:12:58.961 --> 00:13:08.805
who were supposed to be incurable, are
cured. So many people, specially with

00:13:08.805 --> 00:13:16.975
serious diseases like cancer. I mean, in
the Medical Science for cancer, they'll go

00:13:16.975 --> 00:13:24.346
on like this, like that, till they shave
you off completely but not in Sahaja yoga.

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:31.450
Immediately you will know that this man is
possessed. Now this line to Medical Science,

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:38.781
is absolutely not there but in our country
we always believed in that. We have certain

00:13:38.781 --> 00:13:47.336
rules or regulations about people who are
dead, how to behave, how to go to shamshan

00:13:47.336 --> 00:13:59.553
and all that. There is a particular type 
of understanding of all these dead bodies.

00:14:00.404 --> 00:14:08.644
How they behave, where do they go and is,
I think, a very big part of your knowledge,

00:14:08.644 --> 00:14:17.297
very big part. So many diseases incurable,
you cannot cure, which are mostly coming

00:14:17.297 --> 00:14:24.102
from the left side. Medical Science can cure
the right side, I know that, that they can do it

00:14:24.274 --> 00:14:31.724
but cancer they'll go postponing from one
to another. They'll operate, then it will

00:14:31.724 --> 00:14:40.818
spread, then this and that. Operation is
not the way to cure, it's not. If you are

00:14:41.742 --> 00:14:47.722
expert in Sahaja yoga, you don't have to
operate. Overnight you can cure, overnight

00:14:47.722 --> 00:14:54.388
you can cure cancer patient, believe Me. You're
quite capable of doing that, specially Indians

00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:03.060
because Indians have a special capacity,
I should say, what special blessing of this

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:10.624
country. We don't know this country, how
great it is but we are only dealing with

00:15:10.624 --> 00:15:16.213
the Western education. Now where have they
reached, these Western people in their

00:15:16.213 --> 00:15:25.192
experiments, I just don't understand. Their
children are taking to drugs, their families

00:15:25.192 --> 00:15:33.936
are disturbed, everything is so upset. Not
that I decry this education, not at all

00:15:34.638 --> 00:15:42.988
but it is not complete and you should have
the other side of it. Otherwise don't have

00:15:42.988 --> 00:15:54.284
a Cancer Hospital - only have physical
things by which you'll work it out but if

00:15:54.284 --> 00:16:04.018
you want to have patients of all types,
then you must know the other side. There's

00:16:04.018 --> 00:16:11.150
nothing to be frightened, nothing to be
upset but it's a knowledge which you should have

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:17.733
as doctors because I think, the Medical
Science is still not complete. That as,

00:16:18.641 --> 00:16:25.221
Dr. Agarwal himself has said it but what
is lacking in it, the knowledge of the

00:16:25.221 --> 00:16:33.432
left side that we have. Now, if I should
say that, I didn't read it in any book,

00:16:34.452 --> 00:16:41.742
I didn't get it from any book but only when
I was working with Sahaja yoga with people,

00:16:41.742 --> 00:16:48.243
I discovered that compared to India, 
Western people are much more affected by

00:16:48.243 --> 00:16:58.728
the left side, much more and they cannot
understand how they are sick, what has

00:16:58.728 --> 00:17:09.487
happened to them. Even if you take a very
limited area of treatment of a human welfare,

00:17:09.797 --> 00:17:18.608
then, is a very important part, is the
left side. Supposing a lady, who is all

00:17:18.608 --> 00:17:31.509
the time crying and weeping and unhappy,
she can get cancer. Now there're two types

00:17:32.181 --> 00:17:38.021
one also right sided diseases - one 
is of course the left side. In the right

00:17:38.021 --> 00:17:46.690
sided people, who are extremely, I should
say, aggressive, extremely over powering,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:52.195
controlling type, you know - of course
they have a very bad liver, I must say,

00:17:52.554 --> 00:17:54.944
they have a very bad liver

00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:03.670
and when they get like that, they cross
all the limits and when they cross all the

00:18:03.670 --> 00:18:10.198
limits, they get such diseases, which
you cannot find out, you cannot cure.

00:18:12.198 --> 00:18:19.668
One of them is the disease of the liver. I
think, doctors can't cure liver, they may

00:18:19.668 --> 00:18:30.067
try but can't cure liver as Sahaja yoga can
cure. And such a person who's temperament

00:18:30.067 --> 00:18:38.265
is so hot-tempered and is so aggressive
and this and that, he suffers from that

00:18:38.698 --> 00:18:49.188
horrible liver and develops all kinds of
complications with it. There are so many

00:18:49.188 --> 00:18:55.586
other diseases also on the right side, so
many other, but mainly, I think, is the

00:18:55.833 --> 00:19:04.133
disease of the liver. Liver is 'live with'
and if your liver is out, there is no

00:19:04.133 --> 00:19:12.039
solution in the Allopathy, maybe little
bit here, a little bit there. But at the

00:19:12.039 --> 00:19:24.794
climax of it, with the liver one can
faint, one can even die. In the West,

00:19:24.794 --> 00:19:35.270
liver problem is very common and there is
no solution for them for that. They're all

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:45.086
living with it and doctors just admit them
in the hospital. These are not incurable,

00:19:45.086 --> 00:19:51.760
they are absolutely curable. Because we
haven't got that knowledge and that's why,

00:19:52.614 --> 00:20:01.714
we call them incurable. No, they are not.
I do not want to blame other diseases but

00:20:01.999 --> 00:20:08.719
there are so many of them, which cannot be
even diagnosed and which cannot be cured

00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:17.510
by the Medical Science, which we must accept
first of all, that that is the situation. We

00:20:17.510 --> 00:20:25.274
may go on trying, doing anything but we
cannot cure. So many types of medicines

00:20:25.274 --> 00:20:31.668
will come out, we cannot cure because what
I'm trying to tell you, that's only half

00:20:31.668 --> 00:20:41.976
part of your being is discussed. In that
also, so many things are not there. Take

00:20:41.976 --> 00:20:50.334
it for example, asthma. Asthma cannot be
cured by doctors - is a fact but Sahaja yoga

00:20:50.334 --> 00:20:58.856
can absolutely cure asthma. Allergies also
can be cured by asthma because if you have

00:20:58.856 --> 00:21:06.096
the roots of all the troubles, if you know
about the roots - not pharmaceutical and

00:21:06.096 --> 00:21:13.494
all that but real roots, then you can
handle the situation and you can cure. We

00:21:13.494 --> 00:21:19.750
haven't got any yet a college or anything,
so far, if Sahaja Yog. I wish we could

00:21:19.970 --> 00:21:31.400
but hospital we have. We have a hospital 
in Belapur, they call it New Bombay, where

00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:37.368
they are treating people. Only they have
to pay for their stay and it's hardly,

00:21:37.368 --> 00:21:48.694
I think, Rs. 300 per day for poor people
but you don't need any medicine, you don't

00:21:48.694 --> 00:21:53.849
have to pay for anything. For our country
which is so poor, don't you think it's

00:21:53.849 --> 00:22:03.458
very important otherwise you go for X-ray,
then you go for another test, then for

00:22:03.458 --> 00:22:14.221
another test and nothing comes out of it.
One should only know how to deal with it.

00:22:16.322 --> 00:22:25.552
Now supposing, if somebody's leg is broken,
fix it, cut his leg, put another leg - no need.

00:22:27.088 --> 00:22:35.468
I assure you there is no need. Now we have
some doctors in Sahaja yoga, very good,

00:22:36.239 --> 00:22:43.019
some of them are in America, some of them
are in Italy and some of them are in Russia.

00:22:43.616 --> 00:22:49.346
Russian doctors are very good. I don't 
know how they think that there is something

00:22:49.346 --> 00:22:57.374
beyond this education and they are trying
to learn it. If you can make any facility,

00:22:57.374 --> 00:23:03.936
I'll be very happy but in any case, I'm
thinking of starting a Sahaja Yoga hospital

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:16.300
in your country, specially in Delhi, in
Greater Noida and if some of your doctors

00:23:16.542 --> 00:23:25.312
can join us, they can help us a lot. In 
Greater Noida I'm thinking of starting a

00:23:25.651 --> 00:23:34.441
college or we call it a school, where we'll
get the students as well as doctors who can

00:23:34.441 --> 00:23:43.799
cure people and it will be, there will be
no charges for treatment. Of course,

00:23:43.994 --> 00:23:47.774
where they stay, if they come and stay
there, then they might have to pay for

00:23:47.774 --> 00:23:54.015
their food - that's all, otherwise this is
an arrangement I'm having and anybody,

00:23:54.015 --> 00:24:02.725
who wants to join as a doctor also, we'd
like to accept their services. How much

00:24:02.725 --> 00:24:09.626
will be the pay, I don't know but not much, I must
say, we'll pay about Rs.6000 to Rs.7000 per month

00:24:09.626 --> 00:24:15.762
to a doctor but he has to be a Sahaja yogi
and he should know the method of Sahaja yoga.

00:24:16.383 --> 00:24:26.543
I think, it is one of the very generous
feeling that in our country so many die

00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:34.550
because they cannot get into the hospital,
they cannot get treated. If you can give

00:24:34.550 --> 00:24:45.763
some time to this project of Mine, I'm sure,
I'll be able to organize a good hospital for

00:24:45.763 --> 00:24:52.438
those people. In that we'll have Somatic
patients as well as Psychosomatic patients

00:24:52.938 --> 00:24:59.978
all kinds of patients we'll have and you
will learn so much because it's a very

00:24:59.978 --> 00:25:08.692
subtle and deep knowledge. Is cannot learn
it on the book, you have to have experiment

00:25:08.692 --> 00:25:16.345
with the patient. You'll be amazed how you'll
be curing people. It's not a book knowledge,

00:25:16.345 --> 00:25:24.876
it's a very, very practical knowledge and
those, who have that charitable temperament,

00:25:25.553 --> 00:25:33.063
can do very well and learn a lot. One
thing I must tell you, Sahaja yoga has one

00:25:33.063 --> 00:25:40.818
bad point also, that you cannot make money
out of Sahaj yog, you are not. If you try

00:25:40.818 --> 00:25:47.984
making money out of it, you fail. Somehow
or other, this money business is little

00:25:47.984 --> 00:25:56.984
higher for Sahaja yogis - they cannot
manage it but you can [UNCLEAR]. Now we had

00:25:56.984 --> 00:26:06.448
a very nice retired doctor in this Belapur
hospital and he did very well. Now he's

00:26:06.448 --> 00:26:12.465
no more. He worked very hard but his
daughter-in-law is now looking after there.

00:26:14.028 --> 00:26:21.308
If you want, if you're retired people, if
you're not in need of money, much money,

00:26:21.308 --> 00:26:32.713
then it's a very good thing. Also we
provide a say residence, food, everything.

00:26:32.713 --> 00:26:39.560
It can be managed, it is not so difficult 
but it's not a very money-oriented thing.

00:26:40.191 --> 00:26:48.054
I must say, since I was studying in
Medical, now, Medical line has become very

00:26:48.054 --> 00:26:53.194
money-oriented, I'm surprised. I'm
sorry to say but they have become very

00:26:53.194 --> 00:26:58.721
money-oriented and some of your doctors
have gone to America and have be-fooled

00:26:58.721 --> 00:27:04.686
people so much and have made so much money
that you feel ashamed to be an Indian.

00:27:04.686 --> 00:27:09.803
It's like that, you can't make much money
but as retired people

00:27:09.803 --> 00:27:14.669
you can join us and help us and some
of you can come to learn Sahaja yoga.

00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:21.678
Hardly within, say a month's time, you'll
be experts. You can diagnose a thing

00:27:21.678 --> 00:27:27.833
without any delay, you don't have to go
to any laboratory or anything. Immediately

00:27:27.833 --> 00:27:34.069
you'll know what's the trouble is and all
sorts of incurable diseases you can try.

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:43.943
I'm amazed Myself as to how it is working
it will work. Now all these awards and all that

00:27:43.943 --> 00:27:50.360
they have given Me because I've cured people
and done that but I don't have a hospital there.

00:27:50.537 --> 00:27:56.987
First hospital I want to have in Delhi and
here I want to work it out. Let us think

00:27:56.987 --> 00:28:07.041
of working it out ourselves. It's a charitable
hospital and it's very sensible. I've already

00:28:07.041 --> 00:28:13.196
got money to build that but only thing
I need some doctors who can help Me.

00:28:14.103 --> 00:28:19.463
It's a very stunning thing Sahaja yoga, if you
will come, you'll be amazed how it works.

00:28:19.616 --> 00:28:25.496
I know, we have never been that, we have
never been connected to the Divine, we

00:28:25.496 --> 00:28:30.789
have never used the forces of the Divine
and once you start using those forces,

00:28:30.789 --> 00:28:37.582
you'll be amazed at yourself. It is said
that, you should find out who you are

00:28:39.792 --> 00:28:46.232
and that not possible unless and until you
have your Self-realization. Today in our

00:28:46.232 --> 00:28:53.736
country we need Self-realized people. All
kinds of problems can be solved. Every

00:28:53.736 --> 00:29:02.295
type of, I should say, quarreling going on
because you become a collective person,

00:29:03.932 --> 00:29:11.592
you become a personality of very collective
nature. No more fighting, no more is needed -

00:29:11.592 --> 00:29:19.543
I have many Muslim countries who have got
realization. Turkey, there's Benin, there's

00:29:19.543 --> 00:29:26.566
another one called as Ivory Coast - there
are seven countries that side. They are all

00:29:26.566 --> 00:29:33.786
Muslims converted, [UNCLEAR] transformed
into Sahaja yoga. It's all the integration

00:29:33.786 --> 00:29:46.456
of all the religions take place, understanding
of the human abilities, human personality and

00:29:46.456 --> 00:29:53.666
respect. I mean, it's a very different
atmosphere into which you do, it's a very

00:29:53.666 --> 00:30:00.856
different level of awareness as he was
saying, where you become so peaceful,

00:30:00.856 --> 00:30:09.130
silent, yet so sweet. So I don't know in
this short lecture, how much can I tell

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:17.623
you about Sahaja yoga but it is a very miraculous
thing and please try to get your Self-realization.

00:30:17.878 --> 00:30:21.858
He has asked Me, I think I'll try,
if I can do that.

00:30:26.355 --> 00:30:30.255
There's one small thing, you have 
[to] take out your shoes.

00:30:33.282 --> 00:30:37.482
In England, first time I asked them to,
"Take out your shoes," they walked off.

00:30:38.478 --> 00:30:45.818
English can't live without their shoes,
I think. Please take out your shoes.

00:30:49.191 --> 00:30:54.471
Those who don't want to have, can leave.
There's no force on anyone.

00:30:58.543 --> 00:31:09.603
First of all, have faith in yourself that
you can get Self-realization.

00:31:10.289 --> 00:31:15.279
Please put both the feet on the ground.

00:31:30.561 --> 00:31:35.111
Can you put both the hands towards
Me, like this?

00:31:44.101 --> 00:31:47.481
And now, please close your eyes, please.

00:31:55.880 --> 00:32:01.940
You know a lot about Kundalini but now
you will find out what She is.

00:32:43.599 --> 00:32:51.719
Please put right hand on top of your
fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone

00:32:51.719 --> 00:33:02.210
in your childhood. Please. Not touching
the head, away from the head.

00:33:05.798 --> 00:33:23.078
Now, please put your left hand
on top of your head.

00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.340
Again the right hand.

00:34:03.453 --> 00:34:11.573
Now see, if there's a cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area? Could be hot also.

00:34:15.653 --> 00:34:26.613
Just see if there is cool breeze. It could
be hot, as I told you - doesn't matter.

00:34:41.906 --> 00:34:47.896
Now try with the left hand - right hand
towards Me. If there's a cool breeze

00:34:47.896 --> 00:34:51.708
coming out of - please put down your head.

00:35:09.532 --> 00:35:20.266
Annh. There are some left-sided people,
I must tell you, there are some

00:35:21.810 --> 00:35:27.050
but you'll find out very soon.
Now, please open your eyes.

00:35:28.238 --> 00:35:30.958
Again put the hands towards Me, please.

00:35:56.216 --> 00:36:08.266
There is. Now in your hands you'll feel
the cool breeze or maybe the hot.

00:36:30.977 --> 00:36:36.997
Both the hands. [HINDI - All the doctors
have become realized]

00:36:37.925 --> 00:36:44.615
You are saints or what! So many have
got realization. May God bless you all!

00:36:46.973 --> 00:36:55.433
May God bless you! We have some books,
I hope, of Sahaja yoga.

00:36:56.444 --> 00:37:03.844
You all can take and see for yourself
and master this art. It's very good and

00:37:03.844 --> 00:37:14.208
very simple and very much necessary 
in modern times. I told you, for diagnosis

00:37:14.208 --> 00:37:19.503
you don't have do anything. You'll just,
you'll know on your finger-tips what chakras

00:37:19.503 --> 00:37:26.210
are catching. Also you'll know how to cure
them. Very simple, it is, very simple.

00:37:29.712 --> 00:37:32.472
May God bless you!
