00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.916
You are welcome!

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:21.673
Shri Mata ji: Talks to someone in Marathi.

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.420
Marathi

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.140
Marathi

00:01:20.536 --> 00:01:23.870
We are sorry, we can’t have it in Hall.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.160
We can have it in the open, you see .

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:31.120
All this thing, factually,
happens like this.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.179
Did you get relief here?

00:01:33.213 --> 00:01:34.410
How are you?

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.413
Now, How are you, now?

00:01:37.447 --> 00:01:39.913
Hann! Not bad!

00:01:39.946 --> 00:01:41.570
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.050
Shri Mata ji: Not better!

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.865
Have you been to some other Guru, I think;
Have you been?

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.270
Have you been to some other people also?

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.356
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:50.665
Shri Mata ji: Where have you been?

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.664
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.340
But did you go to see some body else also.

00:01:55.373 --> 00:01:57.745
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.636
Yes! To whom did you see?

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.220
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:02:01.253 --> 00:02:03.903
Then, that's
why we can't work you out.

00:02:03.937 --> 00:02:04.937
Yogi: Haan!

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.919
That’s the reason,
we can't work it out on you.

00:02:09.953 --> 00:02:12.712
You see! If you have
been to all these people,

00:02:12.736 --> 00:02:15.803
they spoil your Kundilini
and this does not rise.

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.769
What can we do about it?

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.820
That’s the reason you are not
better, every body is better.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.889
But, if you go to such
people, who spoil your

00:02:24.913 --> 00:02:28.553
Kundilini then we can
not save, it's very difficult.

00:02:28.586 --> 00:02:32.656
[Talks to someone in Marathi].

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.469
Just you go with him, he will tell
how, what to do, one minute outside.

00:02:46.923 --> 00:02:50.218
‘Beta’, what is there to weep
in it, what are we doing here?

00:02:50.242 --> 00:02:52.640
You remove your cloth
and sit comfortably;

00:02:52.665 --> 00:02:55.993
Keep sitting absolutely comfortably.
Nothing, you are not doing anything.

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:59.573
What is there to weep in it?
We have sent out the Doctor Sahib.

00:02:59.601 --> 00:03:04.284
Yes! Sir! Yes, Ok, take this out only, your cloth, take out
your coat. That’s all! Nmastey! How are you, alright!

00:03:08.397 --> 00:03:09.397
Haan!

00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:24.423
‘Arey’, I will vibrate
and ask this child to go

00:03:24.433 --> 00:03:27.523
And tomorrow we will
work it out on him. Alright!

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:33.148
[Hindi- Marathi- English Mix talk]
In day time only take him out of this room;

00:03:33.181 --> 00:03:34.314
Yogi: Where are lemons!

00:03:34.356 --> 00:03:38.305
Some talk in Marathi.

00:03:38.356 --> 00:03:43.305
[Talk in marathi]

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:49.630
Ok, take this, they are giving you, go, ( says something
in Marathi); You go there; he will tell you.

00:03:49.667 --> 00:03:53.590
Can you see him, this child otherwise
he will be disturbing like this.

00:03:53.623 --> 00:04:00.073
Giving so many, [ talks in Marathi]

00:04:00.107 --> 00:04:01.787
Let him go. Good returns
for the bad..... (Unclear).

00:04:01.973 --> 00:04:08.773
Hann! Give here, ‘Bete’, take these and go.

00:04:08.823 --> 00:04:12.006
They are telling you every thing, understand it;
So, come tomorrow morning.

00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:15.123
But tomorrow morning we are going to Delhi.
He will attend you. You, please

00:04:15.156 --> 00:04:21.123
see him. Give him vibrations. Alright! He is Doctor.
Just show him, how to do it. Haan!

00:04:21.206 --> 00:04:24.922
Take him that side, we will take
other Doctor, where has he gone?

00:04:24.933 --> 00:04:26.122
Yogi: [Inaudible]

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:27.139
ठीक है!

00:04:35.706 --> 00:04:42.023
They are after him tirelessly.

00:04:42.056 --> 00:04:46.523
What to say, ‘Baba’, how people waste energy.

00:04:51.256 --> 00:04:57.789
Shri Krishna has said in our Gita,
“Yoga Kshemam Vahamyaham”.

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:04.550
This means, “Yoga first.” He could say “Kshem”
first but he said “Yoga” first and then

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:14.210
“Kshem”. “Kshem” means your wellbeing, your

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:23.100
But first “Yoga” should take place. Until Yoga
happens, you have no business

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:31.570
with the divine. First, you should experience
Yoga i.e. union with Almighty,

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:37.210
Atma [Spirit] should awaken within you.
When the Spirit is awakened within you,

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:41.530
then you enter into the domain of Almighty in reality.
Otherwise, just like a crammer parrot,

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:46.090
everything remains superficial. Until you
know your inner Self,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:51.150
until you have recognition of Self,
you do not enter the domain of

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.990
Almighty. That’s why you are not authorised
to get what Almighty has said.

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:01.670
Many people put blame on Almighty that we
are so much devoted to God, doing so much worshipping,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.290
we stand upside down on our head so long, we do this, do that,

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:12.581
we offer food [bhog], morning till evening keep
chanting, but still why don’t we find Almighty?

00:06:12.606 --> 00:06:17.570
Reality is that in order to talk to Almighty,
you must establish a connection with Him.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:24.070
Until one attains Yoga, Kshem is not possible.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.150
‘Kshem’ means ‘your protection from all sides’,
Lakshmi Tatva [element] gets awakened within us.

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:34.350
Krishna just said “Vahamyaham – I will do”,
But He did not explain, “How.”

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:40.400
So let me explain to you how it works out.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:48.223
When Yoga takes place, Kundalini rises up from
triangular bone and pierces through Brahma Randhra

00:06:48.256 --> 00:06:56.495
When the power of Kundalini pierces through
Brahma Randhra, it gets Light/flame [Jyoti]

00:06:56.520 --> 00:07:02.360
in it, because it receives Light/flame (Jyoti) of our
Spirit and due to this light, Lakshmi Tatva in Nabhi chakra

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:07.820
is awakened. As soon as Lakshmi Tatva is awakened,

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:17.090
you will see that from all sides you will get prosperity.
If someone becomes very rich, whom we call

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:23.210
wealthy, it’s not necessary that he would be prosperous
too. Generally the rich people are seen unhappy.

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:28.510
More money they have, more stupid
they would be, and accordingly in their homes

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:34.910
all sort of dirty things like wine, cunningness,
lies etc. is seen with them.

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:38.950
All the time afraid, fears that the government will
come and catch them, may confiscate, that our

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:44.510
money may be lost, this happens,
that happens. So, those who are wealthy,

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:50.150
they too are not Lakshmipatis. Because
Lakshmi Tatva is not awakened within them,

00:07:50.150 --> 00:07:55.506
they have just earned money. For them money is
just like mud, it does not give any happiness.
सिर्फ पैसा कमा लिया, पैसा उनके लिए मिट्टी
जैसा है, पैसे से उनको कोई सुख नहीं है।

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:58.747
Lakshmi Tatva must be understood.
Last time, I had explained how

00:07:58.771 --> 00:08:02.446
Lakshmi has been formed, She has two lotuses
in her hands, which are of pink colour.

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:08.800
With one hand, she donates and
with another gives shelter.

00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:13.830
Pink colour represents “Love”. If a human
does not have love in his heart,

00:08:13.830 --> 00:08:19.310
he cannot be Lakshmipati. His house should be
like a lotus flower. Lotus

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:24.370
even gives shelter to an insect called “Bhanwra”,
because thats very dry, it’s sharp spikes would pinch

00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.110
if you keep it on hand, comforts it and
let’s it rest on its glory.

00:08:29.110 --> 00:08:33.770
Make it sleep, gives peace. Lakshmipati is
the one whose heart is

00:08:33.770 --> 00:08:39.630
Quite great. One who is very delightful to his
guests and to anyone is

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:43.670
Lakshmipati. But you see, most of the rich
people are the greatest

00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:46.790
beggars. If you visit their house, they would die of fear that my

00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:51.110
two paisa would be spent. The person,
who is always worried that

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:54.350
today 4 cents on this, 2 cents on that is getting
spent, save this, where to save,

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:58.330
from where to recover, such a person
cannot be Lakshmipati.

00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:01.806
A miserly person cannot be Lakshmipati.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:04.890
One who is miser is a miser,
he is not Lakshmipati.

00:09:04.923 --> 00:09:09.073
A miser is poor, very poor.
He has no royalty in his behaviour.

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:13.273
One who has no royalty in his attitude,
should not be called Lakshmipati.

00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:18.000
जो आदमी बादशाही होता है, वो चाहे गरीबी में रहे चाहे अमीरी में रहे, वो बादशाह ही होता है।
One who is royal always lives in a royal manner
either in poverty or affluence.

00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:21.430
He lives like a king. One who is worried about
petty things, after every penny,

00:09:21.430 --> 00:09:25.350
About two-two coins,

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:30.710
cannot be a Lakshmipati. Since Lakshmi
Tatva is not awakened,

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:34.490
he gets a strong catch of Nabhi Chakra.
Materialism creeps in such a person,

00:09:34.556 --> 00:09:39.030
he becomes very materialistic. He picks on
every small thing like this is mine, this is my

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:43.010
son, blah blah. If all such things get in someone,

00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.790
he is not a Lakshmipati.

00:09:45.823 --> 00:09:49.206
“Should I steal this person’s thing, steal
that person’s thing,

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:54.873
take this or take that, everything should be for
myself,” One, who thinks like this is also not a Lakshmipati.

00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:58.700
One who is for others, “If I have a posh house,
how many people will be accommodated,

00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.320
if I have some nice things, how many people
will feel comfort. How would I

00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:07.560
welcome others, how would
I be able to help others, how would I

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:11.940
keep others in my heart?” There is no question
of helping others. One thinks that

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:17.000
these are my own [kins], “Whatever I am
trying to do is, to help myself.”

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.906
Then Lakshmi Tatva is awakened in real.

00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:22.620
His face, his lifestyle has to be like a lotus,

00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:31.890
such a person should be fragrant and
unlike one who stinks with pride. One should be very humble.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:38.960
One should be very humble. You must have seen
Lotus that it is bent little bit

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:44.000
downwards. Lotus never stands straight;

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:47.423
it’s stem is always bent down a
little bit.

00:10:47.433 --> 00:10:51.023
Likewise, the lotuses
held by Lakshmiji in her hands,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.873
both Lotuses have similar tenderness.

00:10:54.899 --> 00:11:02.523
While interacting with others, he talks with very
cool attitude, with joy, full of compassion, not artificial

00:11:02.580 --> 00:11:07.220
Those lotuses are not that of plastic,
but real. Such a person in

00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:13.860
reality should be like a lotus. At one hand one

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:17.140
donations should keep on flowing and
flowing always.

00:11:17.173 --> 00:11:19.123
I have seen my father like that.

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:22.940
He was very generous person.

00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:27.240
Always giving. If he accumulates
something in ample, he would donate.

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.760
He would not get enjoyment, until he
donates something. If someone tells him

00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:33.180
that, “Why don’t you watch out
what people are taking away?”

00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:36.060
On this he answers that, “What should
I keep watch on? Who has to give out is

00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:42.643
giving away, I am just standing in between and giving?
What to see, I feel embarrassed when people say that I am donating.”

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.810
Such a wealthy peson, who does not
accumulate anything for himself

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:51.551
but keeps distributing things to others,
keeps giving to others, in giving

00:11:51.575 --> 00:11:55.720
he gets pleasure not in receiving,
such a person is Lakshmipati.

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:59.658
Only such a person gets it and keeps giving.
One who keeps thinking of himself,

00:11:59.682 --> 00:12:03.620
“How I will be benefitted, how my children
will be benefitted, how will I get better?”

00:12:03.620 --> 00:12:09.480
such a person is not Lakshmipati, has
no grace, he is like a beggar.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.600
And with other hand he gives shelter.
Whoever comes to his house, takes care with love, care him like his own son.

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:21.900
cares him absolutely like his own son.
In his house, there are servants,

00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.920
animals and people in his shelter,
but they all always know that he is their

00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.340
protector. If we have any trouble, he will
help us. Even in night he will get up to help us.

00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.840
He does it silently and does not tell,
doesn’t let them realize that I

00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.320
have done so much for them, did that;
He does it absolutely secretly. God is

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:47.580
Also exactly same. He is like a woman, having
motherhood as that of Lakshmi.

00:12:47.580 --> 00:12:52.020
and she stands on a lotus. Just think about it,
in order to stand on a Lotus how much simplicity

00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:57.180
one has to have, absolutely light
without putting any load on it. That person

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.860
must be such that he can stand on a Lotus
and he does not put

00:13:00.860 --> 00:13:05.600
pressure on anyone. He must be very humble.
Those who show off about their possessions that,

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:10.780
“We have this, that, blah blah”
cannot be Laxmipati. Mothehood

00:13:10.780 --> 00:13:16.860
Must be in him. Must have a Mother’s heart,
then we can call him Laxmipati. All these

00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:22.120
are characteristics of a Laxmipati.
And when this element is awakened in you,

00:13:22.145 --> 00:13:25.890
the first thing that comes to you is the satisfaction.

00:13:25.923 --> 00:13:30.856
There is no limit of anything otherwise, you know,
as they say in Economics that “No needs are satiable in general.”

00:13:30.890 --> 00:13:36.390
Today you have this thing, so tomorrow you need
that thing, then something else and so on.

00:13:36.433 --> 00:13:40.023
आदमी पागल जैसे दौड़ता राहत है, उसकी कोई हद ही नहीं है। आज
Man keeps running like a mad, there is no end to that. Today

00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.006
I get this so now I need that, something else.

00:13:44.057 --> 00:13:46.775
But one achieves contentment

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:50.660
Until he achieves contentment, cannot

00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:55.860
enjoy anything. Because contentment is
thing of present,

00:13:55.860 --> 00:14:01.160
hope is thing of future and
disappointment is

00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:06.880
thing of past. When you stand in contentment,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:10.300
you are fully enjoying your possessions. Otherwise,
whatever one may have,

00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:14.900
he keeps on saying, “Oh that other person has
so much. I want that thing, then why

00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:19.280
did you get this thing?” When he gets that
he again wants something else. Such a person

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:23.480
can never enjoy his life and neither
can he ascend. Day and

00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:29.580
night his eye will be only on such things.
Things which are in vain, things which are not important,

00:14:29.580 --> 00:14:35.880
things which are meaningless in life, things
which have nothing to do with joy in life,

00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:40.680
he keeping chasing only such things in life.
But first Yoga must happen

00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:44.656
then Kshem [wellbeing] follows.

00:14:44.690 --> 00:14:47.423
Here many Sahaja Yogis have accompanied me,
who have been with me in Sahaja Yoga

00:14:47.450 --> 00:14:52.750
who have been with me in Sahaja Yoga and
they have achieved it and

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:58.270
progressed in it. They progressed
financially too, all of them A to Z.

00:14:58.270 --> 00:15:01.990
Some of them who were penniless earlier,
gained hundreds of thousands

00:15:02.015 --> 00:15:07.646
of rupees [Lacs]. We have such people too here,
who, now as we will see here

00:15:07.713 --> 00:15:12.063
For instance, these English people, they wanted
to visit India and have been thinking,”How to go”.

00:15:12.097 --> 00:15:16.506
They have money of course. They also
achieved financial wellbeing, earned lot of money

00:15:16.540 --> 00:15:19.536
and enjoyed a comfortable life.
But when they were about to travel, a firm offered

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:24.856
to sponsor their travel since
they had done something for them.

00:15:24.890 --> 00:15:32.139
Almighty helps even in such small ways and you save so
much of money that you don’t understand what to do with that money.

00:15:32.167 --> 00:15:38.579
Earlier they used to take drugs,
drink and all sorts of things.

00:15:38.633 --> 00:15:42.933
Lot of money used to get lost in
such things. Now I notice

00:15:42.983 --> 00:15:48.633
that they have good homes, got all good things
in their homes, they listen good music, have all good hobbies,

00:15:48.666 --> 00:15:52.273
started living a good life,
their children became very good.

00:15:52.307 --> 00:15:55.973
I asked them, “How all this happened?” They answered
that, “Earlier we used to waste all of money

00:15:56.000 --> 00:16:00.139
and had no sense about our whereabouts itself.
We were always out of our senses

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:01.273
and had no idea about our lifestyle

00:16:01.290 --> 00:16:07.006
and actions.” That’s the reason all Gurus
prohibited wine and other

00:16:07.072 --> 00:16:13.523
such things. This wine is such harmful thing that
the moment bottle enters the house from one side,

00:16:13.557 --> 00:16:19.506
Shri Laxmi immediately steps out from other.
It’s so simple. No sooner she notices bottle coming in

00:16:19.530 --> 00:16:22.662
the house, she leaves immediately from other side.
Such person never gets blessings of Lakshmi ji.

00:16:22.686 --> 00:16:27.612
Those, in whose homes drinks are prevalent,
will never have blessings of Lakshmi ji.

00:16:27.636 --> 00:16:31.762
Of course, they may have lot of money, their sons would
waste money, wife would run away, children would run away

00:16:31.802 --> 00:16:39.108
something or other show will happen.
Tell me about one single home,

00:16:39.136 --> 00:16:47.040
where they drink, and have happiness. They cannot be
happy, as wine is always against the happiness.

00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:51.806
That’s why Gurus said “No” to wine.
Specifically, why did everyone prohibited?

00:16:51.830 --> 00:16:58.906
We must think about it. After all they were not insane.
Thousands time they told not to drink,

00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.473
“Drinking is bad! Don’t drink, don’t drink, ”

00:17:02.506 --> 00:17:08.529
Wine is a thing, God never created for drinking.

00:17:08.563 --> 00:17:11.913
It was created for polishing, doing polish.

00:17:11.933 --> 00:17:14.563
But people will start drinking and offering,
what to say about people’s mind?

00:17:14.580 --> 00:17:19.229
What can one do, if they start drinking anything?
Man’s mind is so stupid

00:17:19.253 --> 00:17:22.353
that anything they like, start drinking it.

00:17:22.433 --> 00:17:28.173
Who told them to drink? When you drink
this polish on the name of wine,

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:33.140
all your lever, intestines

00:17:33.164 --> 00:17:37.164
get polished too. Even your arteries
get stiffened with polish.

00:17:37.188 --> 00:17:45.173
Arteries become so stiff that their
tissues are no longer flexible,

00:17:45.197 --> 00:17:48.756
means they cannot grow bigger or
smaller, they just freeze.

00:17:48.767 --> 00:17:54.206
Arteries size just gets fixed,
so even blood cannot flow.

00:17:54.233 --> 00:17:59.806
Blood gets stuck in them unless there is pressure on it.

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:07.806
If there is no flexibility in arteries and it becomes
like a stiff pipe, what would happen?

00:18:07.856 --> 00:18:13.090
Such coatings of polish keep on accumulating beyond
limits and man himself becomes like a polish.

00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:18.123
Such person is very artificial. Such drunker will
show off superficially lot of goodness in him,

00:18:18.133 --> 00:18:23.790
He looks gentleman, he is generous,
this, that. All superficial.

00:18:23.800 --> 00:18:28.906
One who can keep his wife and children starved,
one who can show high-handedness with wife and children,

00:18:28.933 --> 00:18:33.966
whatever fake gentle behaviour may such
a person exhibit, his love [voice not clear].

00:18:33.990 --> 00:18:39.550
That’s why liqueur has been prohibited. It has been
prohibited so much, why did they do so?

00:18:39.574 --> 00:18:44.423
Muslims have been prohibited from drinking,
but none drinks more than Muslims.

00:18:44.466 --> 00:18:48.423
Why did they prohibit, must think.
Person like Muhammd Sahib, why did

00:18:48.457 --> 00:18:52.123
he prohibit; Shri Nanak prohibited it. In London,
no one drinks more than Sikhs.

00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:57.376
They have even defeated English people
there in this. Isn’t it true?

00:18:57.390 --> 00:19:03.006
In which religion, drinking has been appreciated? None of
the religions would have said so. But in every religion, people

00:19:03.033 --> 00:19:09.173
drink so much. And our [Adi] Gurus are being insulted.
Our whole Nabhi Chakra and surrounding it,

00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:14.570
our ten Dharmas which are formed by (Adi) Gurus,
these ten Dharmas are in our Nabhi.

00:19:14.570 --> 00:19:19.570
That’s why our Gurus have prohibited that
in order to establish our Dharmas.

00:19:19.570 --> 00:19:24.870
First thing is that you should not be addicted to
liqueur or any such thing and become

00:19:24.870 --> 00:19:26.110
its slave.

00:19:26.110 --> 00:19:31.073
If you want to be slave,
why do you talk about liberation?

00:19:31.130 --> 00:19:34.606
People think, this slavery is the freedom.

00:19:34.650 --> 00:19:38.130
If someone tells them that, “Son, don’t
drink liqueur”, they think that

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:44.430
they are being restricted, pointed and their freedom is
being snatched. Human beings are so mad.

00:19:44.430 --> 00:19:50.170
If refrained to do something, ‘Bete’ it’s done so that
you don’t become slave of these things.

00:19:50.170 --> 00:19:54.690
Whenever elderly people suggest something,
then one must ponder over it, instead of cramming it morning

00:19:54.690 --> 00:20:00.190
till evening. We must think and ponder over it that,
“Why [such person] has told so?”

00:20:00.190 --> 00:20:04.530
There must be some good reason behind it. Why so
Learned, respected people had to say such a thing?

00:20:04.530 --> 00:20:09.010
Why they told no to this thing in particular?
Must thing about it,

00:20:09.010 --> 00:20:15.530
ponder over it. Any person if thinks over it a little,

00:20:15.530 --> 00:20:20.190
can understand that such filthy things we have adopted,

00:20:20.190 --> 00:20:24.670
due to which, Laxmi principle (Tatva) has vanished [from our society]. Laxmi principle, from India,

00:20:24.670 --> 00:20:28.623
has vanished completely.

00:20:28.656 --> 00:20:32.640
Here Laxmi principle is not existing at all and awakening

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:40.640
it is also very difficult. Because Laxmi principle is
the main step of divine seeking.

00:20:40.673 --> 00:20:45.830
Nabhi is the abode of Shri Vishnu and
the abode of Shri Vishnu is,

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:53.090
Vishnu, whom we know, Shri Laxmi is power of
Shri Vishnu. It’s where from journey of seeking begins.
विष्णु का जिसे हम लक्ष्मी उनकी जो
शक्ती मानते हैं, इसी में हमारी खोज शुरू होती

00:20:53.090 --> 00:20:59.130
When we are at amoeba stage, we seek food.
When we evolve to bigger animals,

00:20:59.130 --> 00:21:05.170
then we seek more food, water,
companionship. After that

00:21:05.170 --> 00:21:10.670
we became humans, so now we seek power,
authority and money. Many people

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:14.990
are all the time after the food.
Morning till evening

00:21:14.990 --> 00:21:20.270
what to eat, what not to eat, do this, do that, remain
engrossed in all these things, spoiling [themselves].

00:21:20.270 --> 00:21:24.010
Those who have sickness of overeating,
how they too Laxmipati, they are

00:21:24.010 --> 00:21:27.603
beggars. They are never contented;

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:32.536
Once one of our daughter in law in relation visited us and
started saying, “In our paternal place we had all this, that.”

00:21:32.570 --> 00:21:36.286
So I said, “A little of that should reflect in you as
you don’t have even little contentment.

00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:38.286
You want to eat this thing, that thing,

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:43.919
want to roam around all over. Did your father
nurture any satisfaction at all in you or not?

00:21:43.953 --> 00:21:47.370
If your father was really such a Laxmipati, there
would be at least some contentment in you.”

00:21:47.407 --> 00:21:50.490
If you get something fine, else forget about it.

00:21:50.523 --> 00:21:54.565
When a man reaches such a stage.
When he loses his authority,

00:21:54.590 --> 00:21:58.173
he learns that he did not find happiness in power, money,

00:21:58.223 --> 00:22:06.206
anything that he had been seeking. Then seeking
for the joy begins and that too from Nabhi Chakra.

00:22:06.273 --> 00:22:11.290
Just due to this seeking, we evolved from amoeba
stage to Humans. And due to same seeking

00:22:11.290 --> 00:22:17.370
though which we seek divine, we evolve from human
stage to Super Human [Ati Manav]. We know Self,

00:22:17.450 --> 00:22:23.270
we know Spirit. That’s the reason, Laxmi principle is
very important. And Lakshmi ‘Tatva’

00:22:23.270 --> 00:22:29.910
is situated surrounded by the Dharma.
There are ten Dharmas in human beings.

00:22:29.910 --> 00:22:32.970
Now since you have become modern,
so go and trash all Dharmas.

00:22:32.970 --> 00:22:35.545
Now, you have become modern, great!

00:22:35.570 --> 00:22:41.370
But these ten Dharmas are anyways inside you;
It’s poven these are very much there. If man

00:22:41.370 --> 00:22:46.770
does not have these ten Dharmas [virtues], he would
become devil. Just as gold has it’s own dharma

00:22:47.150 --> 00:22:52.190
that it does not get deteriorated,
similarly these ten dharmas in you

00:22:52.190 --> 00:22:55.910
let you maintain the human principles. If
you disregard these ten Dharmas,

00:22:55.910 --> 00:23:01.110
There are sub-Dharmas too but basically you have
to maintain these ten Dharmas [virtues]. If

00:23:01.110 --> 00:23:06.750
you disregard these ten Dharmas, you will
never be uplifted, you cannot be

00:23:06.750 --> 00:23:10.210
realized. First unless you establish
your Dharmas, you cannot

00:23:10.210 --> 00:23:11.283
become dharmateet [go beyond Dharmas],

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.510
cannot rise above Dharma.

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:15.430
First these Dharmas have to be established.

00:23:15.430 --> 00:23:18.140
That’s why all these Adi Gurus have worked so hard,

00:23:18.170 --> 00:23:19.390
they worked too hard.

00:23:19.390 --> 00:23:22.690
And we are destroying their hard work.

00:23:22.730 --> 00:23:24.250
We are completely destroying them.

00:23:24.250 --> 00:23:27.550
Our first primary duty is to
establish in these ten Dharmas.

00:23:27.550 --> 00:23:31.130
But nowadays these gurus have
nothing to do with your Dharmas.

00:23:31.130 --> 00:23:35.610
“Okay so you drink? No problem.
get us a bottle too.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.470
Okay you keep many women? Okay, no problem
you keep tens of women. Just, one,

00:23:40.470 --> 00:23:44.573
send to us too” or “Send your
wife and children to us.

00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:48.550
Whatever money you have in your pocket, give
it to us. We have no concern with you. You do

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:53.050
business as you wish to do. Whatever money
you have in your purse, just deposit here. Then you

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:54.230
do as you wish to.”

00:23:54.230 --> 00:23:59.650
Just today she was narrating one incidence, who has
accompanied me here. She has a cousin sister,

00:23:59.650 --> 00:24:05.530
who happens to be a princess too.
And her husband is a drunker, very bad man.

00:24:05.570 --> 00:24:11.150
He was disciple of a guru. She went and told his Guru
that husband beats and tortures her, has a keep,

00:24:11.150 --> 00:24:16.350
“Please tell him something. He keeps women,
though he is a prince but what to do about him? So spoiled,

00:24:16.350 --> 00:24:21.430
he is getting.” So he started saying, “Leave it,
what’s to you?” He kept on sucking money

00:24:21.430 --> 00:24:26.473
from him, as Guru only had business
only with his money.

00:24:26.490 --> 00:24:28.645
Is this a kind of guru? Those
who suck money from you,

00:24:28.670 --> 00:24:32.270
how can they be your gurus? Those who
survive on your money, they are

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:34.853
actually parasites, worse than your servants.

00:24:34.867 --> 00:24:37.000
At least your servants do some work for you.

00:24:37.037 --> 00:24:42.726
But such evil people who live on your money
should be put in ‘Rakshas’s yoni’.

00:24:42.760 --> 00:24:46.393
And I say,”Those who visit such
devils are great fools”.

00:24:46.417 --> 00:24:49.093
Why don't they see that you can buy God?

00:24:49.126 --> 00:24:53.393
You can buy a guru, if someone is a guru,
will he ever sell himself?

00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.593
He has its own pride, you can't buy him,

00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.590
Whoever wants, you can win him
over only with your love,

00:25:00.710 --> 00:25:05.130
Your devotion, Your affection, your ‘Bhakti’ and
with nothing else you can entice him.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:10.090
He has his own honour, his own prestige.

00:25:10.123 --> 00:25:15.190
He has his own Royalship; how does he care,
you may be wealthy- be at your home.

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:19.365
What’s to him, he can even eat on a
leafy-plate, can even sleep on ground.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:24.756
If he wishes so, can live in a palace too. He lives the
way he wants to. He has no business with you

00:25:24.790 --> 00:25:29.190
except your love, obeisance and
your seeking. If you are true seeker,

00:25:29.270 --> 00:25:34.990
he will put you on his head. You must look
for a Guru, who talks about

00:25:34.990 --> 00:25:39.230
God, who identifies you with your Spirit.
Guru is only one who identifies you with God. You

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:43.990
make such one a Guru. Making whomsoever
a Guru, these are not even agurus,

00:25:44.050 --> 00:25:51.090
they are devils [rakshasa], devils… They
give you rings. One who shows

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:54.723
you rings, while talking about God,
he puts you attention on rings.

00:25:54.796 --> 00:25:59.440
You don’t see it.

00:25:59.473 --> 00:26:05.215
Now there is one who is teaching ‘Ananda’ nude dancing,
teaching immorality. Which religion it is all scripted?

00:26:05.256 --> 00:26:11.581
Another thing we must know about modern gurus,
that they have crafted their own ideas.

00:26:11.606 --> 00:26:20.540
that do not match with earlier Gurus; Their way of
living, their teachings, their behaviour,

00:26:20.567 --> 00:26:23.956
their sayings; nothing is in match with them.

00:26:23.990 --> 00:26:28.310
Every religion holds a history,
which you can say,

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:33.830
that in all religions, see same thing,
absolutely same is being preached. You read

00:26:33.830 --> 00:26:38.330
your Shankracharya, you would know Sahaja Yoga;
Study Kabir you would know Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:38.330 --> 00:26:41.790
Read Nanak you will know, read
Mohammad you will know, Christ

00:26:41.790 --> 00:26:47.930
you read will understand. Right from Confucius and
Socrates you see everyone, Sahaja Yoga only

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:51.840
has been taught.

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:55.660
And all these who make you stand
upside down on head, this that,

00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.490
Make you dance to their tune to destroy you,
how can you recognise them as Gurus?

00:27:01.520 --> 00:27:05.260
Guru has only one identification. One who connects
you with God [Maalik] is the Guru and

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.123
rest are not Gurus.

00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:10.879
If you are standing on Truth, you have to
see only this thing. But man

00:27:10.879 --> 00:27:15.340
has become so superficial that he looks at the circus
instead, how much fuss

00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:20.160
man is carrying, roaming with how
many pots on his head, what hair style

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.473
he is moving with, as if horns on his head!

00:27:25.530 --> 00:27:29.830
Guru has only one identification.
Other than God, any other thing,

00:27:29.830 --> 00:27:32.356
he does not know. He is engrossed in that only.

00:27:32.390 --> 00:27:35.373
Recognise only such a person a Guru
who is on a higher plane than you.

00:27:35.430 --> 00:27:40.570
But ones you purchase in market, whom
you pay, who make fool out

00:27:40.570 --> 00:27:46.473
of you, hypnotise you. You are
attached with them,

00:27:46.556 --> 00:27:50.290
completely associated with them.

00:27:50.339 --> 00:27:53.240
What to say about such people?

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:58.630
And in this Kali Yuga, in this extreme
Kali Yuga, there are many such

00:27:58.630 --> 00:28:00.623
weird cartoons, I tell you,

00:28:00.650 --> 00:28:03.340
Whom to describe, about whom to say?

00:28:03.373 --> 00:28:09.613
Such gurus have never been, nor will they be, I think,
the way the cartoons are nowadays, one over the other.

00:28:09.650 --> 00:28:11.730
But it is so sticky, that thing,

00:28:12.190 --> 00:28:17.170
Recently in Dehradun, a lady had come.
Her Kundalini was completely

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:19.156
so frozen like this.

00:28:19.210 --> 00:28:21.523
So, I asked her which guru she was visiting?

00:28:21.570 --> 00:28:23.410
She told about some guru she used to visit.

00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:25.940
I asked her that, “Did you read about
that guru from newspapers or not?

00:28:25.970 --> 00:28:29.410
He had done something wrong with an
eighteen year old girl, that girl and

00:28:29.410 --> 00:28:33.273
25 more girls published this news in
Blitz and other news papers.

00:28:33.310 --> 00:28:34.670
It was published ten years ago.”

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:39.023
She started saying, “Yes I read
about this but all that is lie.”

00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:42.840
I asked her, “If that’s lie then
what did you get from him?”

00:28:42.870 --> 00:28:44.156
On this she felt very bad

00:28:44.190 --> 00:28:47.930
and started saying, “Mataji I am a married
woman, I am a good person, this and that.” Then

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:52.196
I told her, “Then why do you even
visit such person’s doorstep?”

00:28:52.246 --> 00:28:59.896
It’s not that the lady is a mischievous or a bad
woman, but she is under hypnosis.

00:28:59.946 --> 00:29:02.423
She is hypnotised.

00:29:02.457 --> 00:29:05.856
They have no freedom. Guru will
sit on the seventh floor. You go there

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:09.970
and offer seva. So big boxes are
kept there,you put donations.

00:29:09.970 --> 00:29:16.656
In them. ‘Seva’ means ‘you give donations’.

00:29:16.722 --> 00:29:18.923
And people go there with their pockets full

00:29:18.950 --> 00:29:25.589
to donate. You go and see anywhere,
so big trunks are kept.

00:29:25.623 --> 00:29:30.670
Even when people touch my feet, someone
offers one rupee, sometimes five

00:29:30.670 --> 00:29:36.850
rupees. I feel like laughing. I mean they got so
conditioned, you visit Shri Hanumana temple,

00:29:36.850 --> 00:29:43.390
there also offer one rupee and a quarter. And for this
reason, everywhere, I mean in Mosques, Temples

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.623
everywhere they have messed up.

00:29:46.657 --> 00:29:52.073
They have not spared any holy place.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:56.430
For this very reason, our young
sons, those young people

00:29:56.430 --> 00:29:59.610
wonder, “This is God or some drama?”
They have some wisdom;

00:29:59.610 --> 00:30:04.356
their minds are still intact. They
are developing disbelief.

00:30:04.406 --> 00:30:10.110
You will be surprised, it has spread in all religions.
A gentleman came from Algeria. He was a young

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:16.990
very brilliant engineer. He was also in
this protest, “These Muslims and

00:30:16.990 --> 00:30:20.710
They are so much in fanaticism and
they do [‘Busta’ like this- UNCLEAR]

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.910
these Mulla’s clergies eat up all money and
make living out of public’s money and

00:30:24.910 --> 00:30:30.190
they think of themselves as very great people.
Everyone bows before them. Then we

00:30:30.190 --> 00:30:34.850
saw Pope also, he is another cartoon.”
saw Pope also, he is another cartoon.” So, he
came to me with all these disbeliefs.

00:30:34.850 --> 00:30:38.390
He said all this is falsehood, it’s absolutely
meaningless. All false.

00:30:38.390 --> 00:30:43.190
When he came to me, I said
it’s not like that, “If Truth exists

00:30:43.190 --> 00:30:48.550
then only falsehood will also manifest. When
Truth exists, on its very basis people make false

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:53.250
things.” Right? Truth exists,
Absolute exists. Then I told him,

00:30:53.250 --> 00:30:57.816
“Good now check out Sahaja Yoga.
This Sahaja Yoga stands right in

00:30:57.850 --> 00:31:01.500
between fanaticism and disbeliefs where

00:31:01.550 --> 00:31:06.970
God himself is with you. You get to
realization, experience it.

00:31:06.970 --> 00:31:11.670
You must fix up yourself then. Unless you
establish in Sahaja Yoga, you cannot fully

00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:18.370
experience it.Those who established themselves,
found it. Those who did seek, found it.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:22.230
If you do not seek, the Truth is not going to
come to your feet,

00:31:22.230 --> 00:31:25.806
‘Bhaiya’ seek me

00:31:25.823 --> 00:31:30.689
It has its own prestige. One
must seek it, in seeking

00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:36.740
Truth one is rewarded with bliss,
truth and bliss both are one. When

00:31:36.773 --> 00:31:39.723
both are same, like moon has its moonlight,

00:31:39.733 --> 00:31:44.756
or sun has its sunlight. Similarly,

00:31:44.767 --> 00:31:49.123
you find the Truth and Joy simultaneously. When

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:53.760
You get to the Truth, you get immersed
in Joy; Get engrossed

00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:57.940
in Joy. But this is not about lecturing
that I keep giving lectures

00:31:57.940 --> 00:32:03.100
morning till evening. Lectures give me throat
soars. Now, it’s about finding it,

00:32:03.100 --> 00:32:08.840
achieve something, get to know your Spirit.
I have seen many such brave hearts

00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:12.783
who say, “We did not feel anything,
Mataji.” As if they are very great.

00:32:12.807 --> 00:32:15.483
It must happen. If nothing happens, it means

00:32:15.520 --> 00:32:20.340
there is something wrong with you. There is some
ailment, you must be sick, may be mentally

00:32:20.340 --> 00:32:25.820
you aren’t alright, might be you bowed
before some false guru. If you have

00:32:25.820 --> 00:32:30.400
bowed your forehead, that has been made by
God in all dignity, before a false person

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:37.590
Then every thing gets finished. You should not
believe me too, blindly.

00:32:37.656 --> 00:32:42.170
That’s wrong. We want you to find it and
if you unbelieve even after that, then

00:32:42.170 --> 00:32:46.430
Then there is no greater full than you and
if you don’t settle even after that

00:32:46.454 --> 00:32:49.372
then what can be said for you?

00:32:49.406 --> 00:32:56.460
Once you find it, you must establish in it and after
settling you see that whatever all powers, you have

00:32:56.485 --> 00:33:02.725
flow through your hands like this, that you can share this
bliss with others too. Can give it to others too.

00:33:02.750 --> 00:33:06.890
And how it happens, how it
works out, you will slowly

00:33:06.890 --> 00:33:11.410
As you progress in it, you understand
yourself. Many amongst these

00:33:11.410 --> 00:33:15.590
People, there are many who came to me six
months ago, only six months ago. Now

00:33:15.590 --> 00:33:20.170
this Dr. Benerjee came six months
ago, who is a prominent

00:33:20.170 --> 00:33:25.050
doctor in London and runs his practice in
Germany too. Since he got it, he is

00:33:25.050 --> 00:33:30.610
after this thing. Since then, he has cured cancers
and lot many other diseases. Now he says that

00:33:30.610 --> 00:33:35.430
after finding it, everything else looks irrelevant to us.
Because when you get to the basic principle

00:33:35.430 --> 00:33:39.290
and start working on it , get
hold of it, then other things are

00:33:39.290 --> 00:33:45.190
no more difficult to work upon. Like this, you
all have right to get it. That’s why it’s called Sahaja.

00:33:45.190 --> 00:33:49.990
‘Sah’ means ‘with[in] you’, ‘ja’ means ‘born’.
You also have right to get it and all other

00:33:49.990 --> 00:33:57.139
Person too have rights on it and you must
achieve it. Like one candle can light up another,

00:33:57.206 --> 00:34:02.690
in same way one realized soul can give realization
to others but he too must be a

00:34:02.690 --> 00:34:08.270
realized soul. If one candle is not light up,
what can it do to another? When

00:34:08.270 --> 00:34:13.410
second candle is enlightened, it lights up
third one too. That’s how this happening

00:34:13.410 --> 00:34:18.150
takes place and man gets the
light within. Now getting light

00:34:18.150 --> 00:34:22.510
Does not mean, you see the light. This is
also very weird thing that people

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:27.930
want to see the light. When it’s about seeing
something, you are not there. For example,

00:34:27.930 --> 00:34:31.750
understand if you are outside,
you can see a building but when

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:38.270
you have entered the building, what will you see?
Nothing at all! Then only you are there.

00:34:38.270 --> 00:34:43.203
You don’t see; Wherever one sees something,
must think that you are still outside.

00:34:43.236 --> 00:34:47.450
Those who see the light, it’s like
getting short circuited, like

00:34:47.450 --> 00:34:51.870
The light of spark, so, whoever see the light, tell me, Agnya

00:34:51.870 --> 00:34:57.350
chakra has problem. It needs to be fixed.
Your all chakras, your Kundilini

00:34:57.350 --> 00:35:02.330
cures by itself. She is your mother,
everyone’s individual mother. One that

00:35:02.330 --> 00:35:08.110
you call as “Surati”. She is same “Surati”
and she ascents by itself, and

00:35:08.110 --> 00:35:11.810
cures you and takes you up
there. If you have any faults,

00:35:11.950 --> 00:35:14.470
It can be understood too,
She informs about that defect

00:35:14.470 --> 00:35:17.810
too that cure it. If you have done any
mistake, that also can be corrected.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:22.941
But one must be in receptive mood that,
“Let we receive it and indulge in it.”

00:35:22.973 --> 00:35:27.328
Now one thing that was raised yesterday,
is striking in mind today again that

00:35:27.352 --> 00:35:33.423
it is said that Kundalini Awakening is very difficult, very tough.

00:35:33.506 --> 00:35:37.510
How is it felt? People often dance, few dance
like monkey and some do something.

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.630
Nothing. I have raised Kundalini of
thousands and they got realization.

00:35:41.630 --> 00:35:46.430
It never happens like that. God has
given this thing for your benevolence;

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:49.806
she is your mother meant for rebirth.
She will never cause any pain to you.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:52.598
Instead, she gives you so much comfort.

00:35:52.623 --> 00:35:57.231
Ailments like cancer are cured by Kundalini
awakening. All your diseases can be cured.

00:35:57.256 --> 00:36:02.361
Such a great loving energy which bestows all blessings,

00:36:02.385 --> 00:36:07.490
is sitting inside you. Having
such disbeliefs that

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:12.010
we will become monkey or a frog! This
thing which evolves you into a super human,

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:17.070
would it really turn you into a frog? You must
understand this thing! This is difficult

00:36:17.070 --> 00:36:21.230
for those who are fools, know nothing
about it, who is not authorized

00:36:21.230 --> 00:36:24.310
for it. For one, who is authorized and
knows everything about it’s functioning,

00:36:24.310 --> 00:36:28.650
it’s very simple task to do. Quite
possible that we have authority on it

00:36:28.650 --> 00:36:33.310
and we know all its functions and details, that’s
why it rises so easily. Any way, with your own eyes

00:36:33.310 --> 00:36:37.930
you can see its rising. You can see
its awakening and its ascent too.

00:36:37.930 --> 00:36:41.530
And we have filmed this as well.
But those who are very doubtful,

00:36:41.530 --> 00:36:45.882
Sahaja Yoga develops with bit difficulty
in such people. One must achieve it.

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:49.406
और इसको लेना चाहिए।

00:36:49.439 --> 00:36:52.290
Nowadays such a time has come,
the age we are living in.

00:36:52.290 --> 00:36:58.750
In this Kali Yuga that we are living in. Actually,
I would say that from spiritual perspective

00:36:58.750 --> 00:37:05.150
we are miser. No sensitivity!
We don’t have sensitivity at all.

00:37:05.167 --> 00:37:07.150
If spirituality, had we

00:37:07.190 --> 00:37:11.990
had we understood and if we knew
the identification of Spirit, then we

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:17.030
would have never run behind false gurus. But our ability to recognize Truth has

00:37:17.030 --> 00:37:22.030
become very lowered, very subdued.
We cannot recognize where the truth is?

00:37:22.030 --> 00:37:26.290
Reason behind that is that we have
become so artificial, so artificial.

00:37:26.290 --> 00:37:30.430
If you become artificial, your ability to
recognize truth will be lowered.

00:37:30.430 --> 00:37:34.330
But as I see in villages even nowadays
people recognize it immediately.

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:38.570
They immediately know who is real and
who is fake. They have this acumen

00:37:38.570 --> 00:37:42.290
to know, they can sense that
this person is fake and this

00:37:42.290 --> 00:37:46.470
Person is real.

00:38:01.970 --> 00:38:06.150
But our Sahaja Yoga works out in villages only.
Actually, I visit cities just like that but

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:11.250
real work is done in villages. Those
villagers who are simple and connected

00:38:11.250 --> 00:38:15.230
with God, they get it very easily.
They don’t take even a second.

00:38:15.230 --> 00:38:19.270
They don’t take even a second!
But in city people

00:38:19.270 --> 00:38:23.710
due to the environment and their life style,

00:38:23.710 --> 00:38:28.850
people change themselves, they go
down in their ‘Dharmas’ so much.

00:38:28.850 --> 00:38:32.310
Now, “What’s wrong in that, all people
drink, must drink for business.”

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:38.010
As if business is the God. “One must
drink, without that,

00:38:38.010 --> 00:38:41.940
how business would run.”

00:38:41.990 --> 00:38:44.740
Or otherwise, you say,” In God and [Dharma],

00:38:44.790 --> 00:38:48.390
you have no faith at all”. And if you believe even a little bit, then whatever is non virtuous

00:38:48.390 --> 00:38:52.970
That’s not to be done. There is no need for
any one drink. This too is a misconception.

00:38:52.970 --> 00:38:56.470
That for business one has to drink. One who wants to deceive himself,
no one can save such a person.

00:38:56.470 --> 00:39:01.690
no one can save such a person. You know my husband. He has been in government

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:05.330
job. He ran a big shipping corporation and
after that he has reached very high

00:39:05.330 --> 00:39:09.045
positions. Always, ever I have been telling him only one thing drinking is

00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.146
beyond me and whole life he even
did not touch it, not even a drop.

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.013
And by grace of almighty, he has been very successful.

00:39:15.033 --> 00:39:17.246
Everyone honours him, respects him.

00:39:17.263 --> 00:39:20.863
Till date, has there been even a single statue
of a drunker for this was a great drunker?

00:39:20.896 --> 00:39:26.779
Tell me, any one person, in any country. In England people
drink so much. I never saw any such person’s statue there

00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:30.296
being worshipped for how much he used to drink.

00:39:30.346 --> 00:39:35.373
Has any drunker got any recognition
in this whole world anywhere?

00:39:35.410 --> 00:39:37.423
Then how can your business prosper with its help?

00:39:37.450 --> 00:39:39.990
If your reputation gets lost, how your business will grow?

00:39:40.090 --> 00:39:45.770
Business is rewarded for your repute, business is
not done for cheating. If a man stands once

00:39:45.770 --> 00:39:53.430
anywhere, people recognize him and say such a
man is there. Why are you mixing yourself in these issues of

00:39:53.430 --> 00:39:56.640
society, these illusions?

00:39:56.670 --> 00:40:02.770
You take care of your own personality.
God resides within you. In these Times

00:40:02.770 --> 00:40:07.890
It’s foolish to talk on these lines and
saying itself is foolish. But you don’t

00:40:07.890 --> 00:40:12.423
know how much have you broken yourself within,
how much pushed yourself into slavery.

00:40:12.456 --> 00:40:18.740
After getting away with such things, what is that I can grant you?

00:40:18.770 --> 00:40:24.950
You only tell me. Not at the least,
you must take a vow that, whatever we are

00:40:24.950 --> 00:40:27.356
we have self-respect.

00:40:27.373 --> 00:40:32.286
God Almighty has evolved us from
amoeba to human. One tiny amoeba,

00:40:32.310 --> 00:40:37.990
developing it into human being, how difficult it is?
After letting you pass through thousands of yonis,

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:42.689
God Almighty has created such beautiful humans.

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:50.414
Then he granted you the freedom to make
the choice of goodness or perversion.

00:40:50.439 --> 00:40:54.350
You can embrace anything you like. Do you
want to embrace perversion? Go get pervert.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:41:01.350
If You want to embrace goodness, be good. Now
one must think that the God who created us,

00:41:01.350 --> 00:41:06.150
with so much effort, must have built-in within us some arrangement to

00:41:06.150 --> 00:41:11.870
know him, understand him. Know self and understand the purpose of self

00:41:11.870 --> 00:41:16.890
and why we are born in this world, what is our fulfilment?

00:41:16.915 --> 00:41:21.456
Humans never tried to know why we are born in this world?

00:41:21.490 --> 00:41:28.123
Why don’t scientists think that why
amoeba was evolved into human?

00:41:28.172 --> 00:41:33.098
What’s so greatness within us for which
God created us with so much effort

00:41:33.123 --> 00:41:38.090
and granted us complete freedom. Only at this point,
even God surrenders before you since

00:41:38.090 --> 00:41:42.490
you are free. God cannot take
away your freedom. If you have to be settled in

00:41:42.490 --> 00:41:46.870
the Kingdom of God, to be adorned like a king,
then how can you be in bondage?

00:41:46.870 --> 00:41:51.856
Should hypnosis be used on you?

00:41:51.939 --> 00:41:54.939
You are completely free. If you like,

00:41:54.980 --> 00:42:00.763
embrace God in your life or
if you wish, go for Satan.

00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:05.546
God has opened both options for you completely.
And everyone has worked so hard.

00:42:05.613 --> 00:42:12.600
Let me tell you all Gurus have faced so many troubles for you.

00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:17.200
All incarnations, Gurus have put in so much of efforts.

00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:23.750
How much we tortured them, how much we cheated them. They tolerated all those pains in order to establish you, people.

00:42:23.780 --> 00:42:29.440
But this Kali Yuga came like a
typhoon that we forgot everything. And

00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:35.556
We have forgotten all our spiritual insensibility,

00:42:35.597 --> 00:42:43.023
So surprising, that we can not recognize anyone
by his face whether he is a real one or fake.

00:42:43.056 --> 00:42:50.806
If a person is Godly, it becomes evident from his face.

00:42:50.856 --> 00:42:56.230
We lost this ability to recognize [truth], that

00:42:56.230 --> 00:43:00.089
sensitivity within us completely vanished.

00:43:00.173 --> 00:43:05.330
When Rama came in this world, all knew that he is an incarnation. When Krishna came,

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:10.889
all recognized him as an incarnation. But now
such Time has come that none recognizes anyone.

00:43:10.956 --> 00:43:13.910
In Christ Time also the same thing
happened. But few people

00:43:13.910 --> 00:43:18.070
Did recognise; But today time has come that people
recognize bhoots and rakshasas

00:43:18.070 --> 00:43:22.906
as an incarnation.

00:43:22.939 --> 00:43:26.873
One must pull out from these illusions and
one must ask for only one thing that,

00:43:26.890 --> 00:43:31.189
“O Lord, please be awakened within us. So that we can know ourselves.”

00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:36.356
Without recognition of Spirit, we cannot know God, can’t know, can’t know.

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:40.840
Everything else is futile. All this is a circus.

00:43:40.864 --> 00:43:46.690
All these, as we call them are external

00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:52.523
displays. No point in satisfying ourselves with these external shows.

00:43:52.556 --> 00:43:56.880
You are deceiving yourself only. Who
can deceive God? He very well,

00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:03.500
knows you. You are causing losses to yourself only.
You must achieve it since it’s your own

00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:09.580
energy, your own property. The source is right
within you. Everything is filled inside you only,

00:44:09.580 --> 00:44:13.306
you must get it and then must
establish yourself in this.

00:44:13.373 --> 00:44:18.980
When I come in Sahaja Yoga, many people come, but all here say, “ Mother!

00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.680
They don’t make progress”.
Now, where I have seen such

00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:26.320
hopeless people but they have reached great heights.
And those, we thought great about some people,

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:32.100
they are sticking where they were. They come back
with same issues, same headaches, same problems,

00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.980
same troubles. This is happening, that’s happening;
Still their level has risen only this much.

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:42.430
In Sahaja yoga, until you give out,
you cannot progress.

00:44:42.430 --> 00:44:48.523
You will have to give out. As you keep giving to
others, you would keep progressing further.

00:44:48.556 --> 00:44:53.080
If we build a big boat, say a
ship and we don’t put it

00:44:53.105 --> 00:44:57.847
in waters, it carries no meaning of this?

00:44:57.871 --> 00:45:01.225
Just like that, if a man finds God

00:45:01.250 --> 00:45:06.410
and sits at home, what’s the advantage of lighting such a ‘Deep’

00:45:06.410 --> 00:45:11.890
That light it and you place it under a table? The candle is light up so that others

00:45:11.890 --> 00:45:15.990
may get the light.

00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.665
With this you can see inside you as well others too

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:23.890
You can see; You can see your own
Chakras and other’s Chakras too

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:28.110
You can see your own joy and see other’s grief too.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.430
And you can know how to give it out to others,

00:45:32.430 --> 00:45:40.406
where is it getting obstructed, how should we make it.

00:45:40.439 --> 00:45:46.370
For today’s this is enough. Now let’s
meditate and see how many get

00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:51.010
their realization. You all sit comfortably. Those
who can’t sit down, please get the chairs

00:45:51.010 --> 00:45:55.690
for them. Because those who can’t sit down,
should not push themselves.

00:45:55.714 --> 00:46:01.110
Rajesh you sit on the chair. Those who are tall,
find it difficult to sit down on floor. Can you sit? Hann!
