WEBVTT

00:01.461 --> 00:04.461
The question was asked Me,

00:04.670 --> 00:09.045
“What Puja we are going to have today?”

00:10.295 --> 00:13.295
And I kept it a secret.

00:18.711 --> 00:23.337
Today we should worship

00:23.545 --> 00:26.170
the Paramachaitanya,

00:26.379 --> 00:30.254
the All-Pervading Power of God’s Love.

00:42.212 --> 00:44.628
We are aware

00:45.878 --> 00:49.419
that Paramachaitanya

00:51.045 --> 00:53.586
does everything.

00:55.003 --> 00:57.711
At least mentally we know

00:57.920 --> 01:00.920
that everything is worked out

01:01.545 --> 01:04.461
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

01:04.670 --> 01:08.753
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

01:09.628 --> 01:12.628
But still,

01:14.129 --> 01:19.087
it is not so much in our heart,

01:26.295 --> 01:30.045
so much in our attention.

01:33.420 --> 01:36.878
We can consider Paramachaitanya

01:37.087 --> 01:39.795
like a ocean,

01:41.379 --> 01:46.420
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

01:47.545 --> 01:51.087
Everything, all the working,

01:52.545 --> 01:57.461
everything, is within its own limits.

01:57.670 --> 02:02.461
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

02:02.670 --> 02:06.087
Now, if you see the sun,

02:06.837 --> 02:10.170
then from the sun

02:10.379 --> 02:14.670
the rays have to come out, to work it.

02:17.045 --> 02:21.045
If you see somebody,

02:23.087 --> 02:26.711
say, a person

02:27.711 --> 02:30.670
who has an authority,

02:32.920 --> 02:36.920
he has to assert that power -

02:37.753 --> 02:40.045
outside.

02:40.295 --> 02:43.379
So within himself

02:43.628 --> 02:46.420
he doesn’t work it out.

02:56.670 --> 02:59.461
Say, for example, if there’s a seed

03:00.503 --> 03:02.670
and inside the seed only

03:03.045 --> 03:07.670
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

03:08.545 --> 03:11.295
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

03:11.461 --> 03:15.003
everything is inside that seed.

03:16.212 --> 03:19.379
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

03:21.962 --> 03:28.419
So we are all enveloped in it.

03:30.295 --> 03:34.254
And only the waves that we see,

03:34.420 --> 03:37.337
and we are on the waves,

03:37.503 --> 03:41.254
so we see it as

03:41.420 --> 03:45.586
dislocated, separated.

03:46.129 --> 03:50.670
Like we feel “this is Germany”

03:52.711 --> 03:56.837
or “this is England, this is India.”

03:57.087 --> 04:01.920
These are just folds of the sari

04:02.586 --> 04:04.628
of Paramachaitanya

04:04.837 --> 04:07.461
which look separated,

04:08.129 --> 04:11.003
but they are not separated.

04:12.087 --> 04:15.420
They are continuous.

04:18.420 --> 04:22.045
So the connection is absolutely complete.

04:22.503 --> 04:25.795
If I pull a thread from here,

04:26.003 --> 04:30.129
the thread will throughout be pulled.

04:33.212 --> 04:37.129
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

04:40.170 --> 04:43.920
is working within itself.

04:46.170 --> 04:50.003
And there is nothing without.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.711
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

05:00.837 --> 05:04.295
it pays special attention to you.

05:04.545 --> 05:08.670
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

05:09.212 --> 05:11.337
one with you.

05:11.503 --> 05:13.878
Whatever you desire,

05:14.087 --> 05:17.254
whatever you want,

05:17.420 --> 05:20.962
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

05:21.170 --> 05:24.045
if you are one with it.

05:25.295 --> 05:28.170
Like in a, say,

05:29.878 --> 05:33.419
turbulent ocean

05:35.628 --> 05:39.795
some drops of water may fly into the air

05:40.212 --> 05:44.337
and start thinking that “we are above.”

05:45.503 --> 05:49.795
We’re away from the world, away from the ocean.

05:50.003 --> 05:53.795
But again they have to fall into the sea.

05:56.795 --> 06:01.170
So this formless energy,

06:02.170 --> 06:07.295
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

06:07.586 --> 06:09.586
all the organizations,

06:09.795 --> 06:12.337
all the computers,

06:14.045 --> 06:16.379
all the televisions,

06:17.045 --> 06:21.087
all that you can think of communication

06:21.295 --> 06:24.711
and of governing, of administration,

06:24.920 --> 06:27.670
and above all,

06:30.087 --> 06:33.420
it is the Love,

06:34.337 --> 06:37.379
it is the Love of God

06:38.711 --> 06:42.295
and Love of your Mother.

06:47.711 --> 06:54.129
So to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

06:56.670 --> 06:59.628
you have to know

06:59.837 --> 07:03.837
that you have to become the reality.

07:09.003 --> 07:13.962
For example, if you take a photograph of Mine, sitting here,

07:17.254 --> 07:22.711
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations, all right,

07:24.795 --> 07:27.795
though it’s a photograph.

07:32.254 --> 07:37.419
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

07:41.087 --> 07:46.628
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

07:48.753 --> 07:53.628
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

07:54.129 --> 07:57.254
It’s like any other painting if you see,

07:57.420 --> 08:00.337
supposing you see a painting

08:00.503 --> 08:03.878
where it is raining.

08:04.503 --> 08:07.503
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

08:07.711 --> 08:10.003
It does not

08:16.045 --> 08:20.087
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

08:20.379 --> 08:23.003
It is static.

08:23.753 --> 08:27.003
So in ignorance,

08:28.087 --> 08:30.461
in ignorance,

08:30.711 --> 08:34.878
we just have the

08:36.419 --> 08:41.337
picture which is static about reality.

08:42.878 --> 08:45.795
And that is the reason why

08:46.003 --> 08:49.254
we think we can work it out

08:49.837 --> 08:52.545
ourselves, everything.

08:53.878 --> 08:58.962
Now if somebody says that, “I see this picture,

09:00.419 --> 09:06.419
all right. And I’ll make the rain as a real thing.”

09:06.628 --> 09:10.129
You cannot. Try anything,

09:11.003 --> 09:12.753
put whatever color you like.

09:12.962 --> 09:15.837
It may appear, it will appear

09:16.420 --> 09:17.795
with effort.

09:18.003 --> 09:23.212
But it will not have the capacity,

09:26.129 --> 09:29.461
nor the nature of reality.

09:32.170 --> 09:35.503
So human beings always deal

09:36.545 --> 09:42.545
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

09:44.795 --> 09:47.087
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

09:47.295 --> 09:49.920
We can feel them.

09:53.003 --> 09:55.628
We can create plastic flowers.

09:55.837 --> 10:00.337
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

10:00.503 --> 10:05.087
But we can’t produce one flower

10:06.045 --> 10:08.753
on our own.

10:14.962 --> 10:18.461
We’ll have to go to reality

10:19.295 --> 10:22.628
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

10:24.670 --> 10:29.545
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

10:34.586 --> 10:38.295
So all of you Sahaja Yogis

10:40.753 --> 10:43.295
have to know

10:43.878 --> 10:48.254
that in reality you do not do anything

10:48.670 --> 10:52.045
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

10:52.419 --> 10:57.170
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

10:57.379 --> 11:02.420
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

11:03.962 --> 11:08.628
And even if he knows, this is not

11:08.837 --> 11:11.545
the truth in his heart.

11:11.753 --> 11:14.670
It’s not a part and parcel of his being.

11:14.878 --> 11:19.419
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

11:20.129 --> 11:23.129
reality is Paramachaitanya

11:23.337 --> 11:27.379
and it is reality that works out everything.

11:29.503 --> 11:32.670
And then this reality is

11:32.878 --> 11:35.962
the Divine Love.

11:37.586 --> 11:40.920
We always separate love from action.

11:41.837 --> 11:45.170
To us love means

11:47.586 --> 11:52.920
some sort of a mad behavior towards a person.

11:55.170 --> 11:59.419
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

12:00.254 --> 12:04.670
It works without any understanding.

12:06.503 --> 12:09.295
When we love somebody,

12:09.461 --> 12:13.419
we don’t know, what do we do?

12:14.419 --> 12:17.170
We think we love you.

12:17.379 --> 12:20.586
Tomorrow we start saying, “I hate you.”

12:21.129 --> 12:24.129
So how can it be love?

12:27.962 --> 12:31.962
We love our own children, love our own family,

12:32.170 --> 12:35.670
love our own friends,

12:35.920 --> 12:38.878
which is so unreal.

12:40.087 --> 12:42.670
If it was real,

12:43.920 --> 12:46.628
it would never have failed.

12:48.419 --> 12:50.962
That you cannot definitely say

12:51.170 --> 12:53.753
that, all right, today you’ll work for your son

12:53.962 --> 12:56.670
and be very selfish about your son.

12:56.878 --> 12:59.129
But you can’t say tomorrow how he will treat you

12:59.337 --> 13:02.003
or you’ll treat him.

13:05.962 --> 13:09.003
But Paramachaitanya knows.

13:10.003 --> 13:14.212
It knows how to express its love.

13:15.628 --> 13:17.878
Not only that,

13:18.087 --> 13:22.586
but it’s an eternal feeling of love,

13:25.087 --> 13:28.878
which may change its hue, color,

13:32.503 --> 13:34.254
but

13:35.461 --> 13:39.837
the concern of that love will be the same.

13:40.045 --> 13:43.837
The essence of love is concern.

13:44.878 --> 13:48.461
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

13:48.670 --> 13:52.295
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

13:52.461 --> 13:55.003
Concern.

13:55.379 --> 13:58.628
Or if we say as “Hita”,

13:59.170 --> 14:01.337
is the benevolence.

14:01.503 --> 14:04.129
So the concern for the benevolence

14:04.337 --> 14:06.461
will be all the time there,

14:06.670 --> 14:11.129
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

14:11.337 --> 14:13.837
might appear to be affectionate,

14:14.045 --> 14:16.087
might appear to be over-indulgent.

14:16.295 --> 14:19.962
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

14:20.920 --> 14:24.379
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

14:25.087 --> 14:28.003
it’s for your benevolence.

14:29.003 --> 14:32.295
It works for your benevolence.

14:32.878 --> 14:35.295
Not only your benevolence,

14:35.461 --> 14:39.170
but the collective benevolence.

14:41.254 --> 14:44.878
And it knows very well what is to be done

14:45.087 --> 14:47.962
how it is to be worked out.

14:50.087 --> 14:53.254
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

14:53.420 --> 14:56.878
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

14:57.087 --> 15:00.337
also is within itself.

15:03.254 --> 15:06.419
It’s such a storage

15:07.878 --> 15:12.962
of wisdom, knowledge and love.

15:15.003 --> 15:18.129
So it does not deviate.

15:18.419 --> 15:22.878
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

15:24.795 --> 15:28.212
for your benevolence

15:28.419 --> 15:31.670
is all the time there.

15:31.962 --> 15:36.586
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

15:36.962 --> 15:40.254
Some people might get a job.

15:40.420 --> 15:43.795
Some people will not get a job.

15:44.003 --> 15:45.920
With some people it will work out this way.

15:46.129 --> 15:49.045
With some people it will not work out that way.

15:49.254 --> 15:51.503
Then one may say that, “How is it, this Paramachaitanya

15:51.711 --> 15:53.503
is behaving like this?”

15:53.711 --> 15:55.628
Is all for your correction.

15:55.837 --> 15:58.545
Is a big churning.

15:58.878 --> 16:01.129
Whatever works out for your correction

16:01.337 --> 16:03.379
and is for your benevolence.

16:03.545 --> 16:05.628
If you understand this point,

16:05.837 --> 16:09.337
then you’ll never be disappointed in your life.

16:16.254 --> 16:19.628
And it has no concern

16:19.837 --> 16:22.170
of its own benevolence,

16:22.379 --> 16:26.337
because it is complete benevolence itself.

16:29.129 --> 16:33.420
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

16:34.379 --> 16:39.878
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

16:40.087 --> 16:44.129
A man, say, who has everything,

16:44.337 --> 16:46.129
worldly things,

16:46.337 --> 16:49.003
still may be concerned about getting more,

16:49.212 --> 16:51.503
the greed, there would be.

16:51.711 --> 16:55.420
But as it is the complete, Purna,

16:56.545 --> 16:58.920
it has no greed.

17:00.795 --> 17:04.045
It’s fully satisfied with itself.

17:04.670 --> 17:07.878
And because it is so powerful,

17:08.503 --> 17:10.837
so knowledgeable,

17:11.045 --> 17:14.212
that it has no doubts,

17:14.920 --> 17:17.379
no doubts of any kind.

17:18.461 --> 17:20.920
And because

17:21.670 --> 17:25.212
there’s nobody which can harm it,

17:25.503 --> 17:28.503
it has no fear.

17:32.795 --> 17:36.503
And you all have now felt

17:36.795 --> 17:40.878
that Paramachaitanya,

17:42.419 --> 17:47.295
should give you a complete fearless life,

17:47.461 --> 17:50.420
a peaceful life,

17:50.962 --> 17:53.170
and a joyous life.

17:53.420 --> 17:58.586
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

18:00.628 --> 18:02.837
no more, now he’s found his mother.

18:03.045 --> 18:07.045
In the same way you have found Paramachaitanya

18:07.254 --> 18:10.045
and the connection with it.

18:10.379 --> 18:14.420
So you don’t have to worry for anything,

18:15.212 --> 18:17.003
don’t have to think about anything,

18:17.212 --> 18:19.670
you don’t have to plan about anything,

18:20.045 --> 18:22.295
only thing is you have to jump into it,

18:22.461 --> 18:25.545
just jump into it

18:26.962 --> 18:32.170
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

18:35.295 --> 18:40.503
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

18:43.419 --> 18:46.295
Now we are in Germany,

18:46.461 --> 18:49.586
and you know in Germany

18:49.795 --> 18:53.045
there have been people who have

18:54.419 --> 18:58.419
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

18:59.795 --> 19:02.003
But

19:02.212 --> 19:05.962
even that happening that took place,

19:06.586 --> 19:10.628
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

19:10.837 --> 19:14.087
of course they are born again, no problem,

19:14.545 --> 19:17.586
and such problems came up

19:19.420 --> 19:22.503
that they were

19:23.962 --> 19:26.254
thinking that

19:26.753 --> 19:29.379
the whole world will be finished.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.586
They were so much worried,

19:32.795 --> 19:35.962
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

19:37.420 --> 19:39.379
But did not.

19:39.545 --> 19:43.753
But this war has taught us a lesson.

19:46.545 --> 19:49.753
It has made us more collective.

19:50.337 --> 19:53.379
It has made us understand each other.

19:54.337 --> 19:57.628
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

19:57.837 --> 20:01.170
that “we are this country”, “we are that country”,

20:01.545 --> 20:03.420
racialism,

20:03.628 --> 20:06.337
then this so-called nationalism,

20:06.503 --> 20:08.586
so-called patriotism -

20:08.795 --> 20:13.254
all these separating forces,

20:14.795 --> 20:17.129
divisive things.

20:18.045 --> 20:22.795
Saw clearly we are all human beings

20:24.295 --> 20:27.878
and we should be treated as human beings.

20:28.545 --> 20:32.254
If you see the history, after every war

20:32.420 --> 20:38.670
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

20:39.003 --> 20:42.419
knowledge of oneness of the world.

20:43.586 --> 20:45.962
It is something

20:47.586 --> 20:51.379
like, you have in a spacecraft

20:51.545 --> 20:55.419
that a container is built in,

20:57.212 --> 21:00.586
one into another,

21:02.295 --> 21:06.170
and the whole thing

21:07.419 --> 21:12.711
comes into a speed, some velocity,

21:13.795 --> 21:17.837
and then the lower container bursts,

21:18.545 --> 21:20.837
or explodes.

21:21.045 --> 21:25.045
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed

21:25.920 --> 21:28.379
to the rest of it.

21:28.878 --> 21:33.920
And so the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

21:34.419 --> 21:38.419
And that’s how one can go into the space.

21:40.003 --> 21:42.837
In the same manner,

21:43.045 --> 21:46.545
all these horrible things that have happened

21:47.254 --> 21:50.170
are explosions

21:51.003 --> 21:54.003
which brings you

21:56.087 --> 21:59.003
towards knowledge

21:59.254 --> 22:01.212
that there’s something wrong with us,

22:01.419 --> 22:05.129
we are living with something unreal.

22:06.670 --> 22:11.461
Now the problems, today’s problems as they are,

22:17.586 --> 22:20.628
like ecology problem,

22:23.920 --> 22:25.419
AIDS,

22:26.503 --> 22:28.337
drugs,

22:30.045 --> 22:35.212
all these modern problems and poverty,

22:36.295 --> 22:39.586
if you see it like a witness, you will see

22:39.795 --> 22:42.503
these are quite shocking.

22:43.628 --> 22:46.045
These are very shocking things.

22:46.254 --> 22:50.753
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

22:51.420 --> 22:54.461
should really shock our mind.

22:55.212 --> 22:58.420
Why we have these problems?

23:00.920 --> 23:05.129
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

23:05.337 --> 23:08.878
that we can solve by making more money.

23:09.920 --> 23:14.170
We can protect ourselves from ecology if we have more money.

23:15.045 --> 23:19.212
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

23:19.420 --> 23:21.420
because we will have more money.

23:21.628 --> 23:24.212
And then we can protect ourselves

23:24.419 --> 23:26.753
so that everybody will have to have a mask,

23:26.962 --> 23:29.503
moving about all over the place.

23:29.878 --> 23:34.295
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

23:34.461 --> 23:38.295
Doesn’t matter if there is ecological problem, doesn’t matter.

23:39.254 --> 23:41.003
So you move about

23:41.212 --> 23:43.795
like a person who is entering

23:44.003 --> 23:47.962
into the area which is all full of fumes.

23:51.129 --> 23:54.003
All these stupid ideas come up because

23:54.212 --> 23:55.962
they do not see

23:56.170 --> 23:59.420
that, what is human dignity is,

24:00.545 --> 24:04.586
that human beings are above

24:04.795 --> 24:08.753
everything else - above machinery,

24:08.962 --> 24:12.920
above all material things of the world.

24:13.795 --> 24:17.795
They will not talk, that we'll balance the machinery. No.

24:18.628 --> 24:21.461
What they will talk, that we'll make a man

24:21.670 --> 24:24.337
a greater slave of the machinery

24:24.503 --> 24:26.419
because he must have money.

24:26.586 --> 24:30.254
He must have more money, and with this more money,

24:30.420 --> 24:34.545
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

24:34.878 --> 24:37.337
It is absurd.

24:38.628 --> 24:42.379
But if you understand the human dignity,

24:42.711 --> 24:45.753
then you have to understand that

24:45.962 --> 24:48.962
as a human being,

24:51.670 --> 24:56.045
we have to take a very positive,

24:56.254 --> 25:00.670
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

25:05.545 --> 25:07.920
Like, now most of the

25:09.129 --> 25:10.670
French

25:12.337 --> 25:13.670
shores,

25:14.419 --> 25:17.920
the beaches, are polluted.

25:18.419 --> 25:20.420
Naturally.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.586
Because they started a funny thing

25:22.795 --> 25:25.545
called “holiday making on the seashore.”

25:26.503 --> 25:28.295
So this is the result.

25:28.461 --> 25:30.419
Now, do what you please.

25:30.586 --> 25:33.878
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

25:34.087 --> 25:36.419
So instead of - now human brain is such,

25:36.628 --> 25:39.962
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

25:40.170 --> 25:43.420
oh, they will say, “We will start some new method

25:43.628 --> 25:46.045
of cleansing this.”

25:46.254 --> 25:48.795
They will never condemn

25:49.003 --> 25:50.962
what has gone wrong with them

25:51.170 --> 25:54.461
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a

25:54.670 --> 25:58.254
funny life that they have on the seashores.

25:58.795 --> 26:00.670
Now, AIDS.

26:00.878 --> 26:03.920
You’ll be amazed that in America

26:04.461 --> 26:07.670
why, even they said that

26:07.962 --> 26:11.503
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

26:11.837 --> 26:15.129
seven hundred thousand people

26:15.670 --> 26:19.212
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS

26:19.419 --> 26:23.254
because they are achieving such a great goal

26:24.920 --> 26:28.628
of leading a life which is nonsensical,

26:28.962 --> 26:32.129
as if like a big revolution.

26:33.212 --> 26:37.003
And thinking that they are very, very

26:37.212 --> 26:40.586
great revolutionaries, great people,

26:40.878 --> 26:44.295
that they are supporting this AIDS

26:47.254 --> 26:51.628
disease and glorifying it.

26:52.920 --> 26:55.295
Can you believe

26:55.586 --> 26:59.795
that this kind of

27:00.003 --> 27:03.920
assertion will be accepted?

27:05.337 --> 27:08.170
People will laugh at you.

27:09.087 --> 27:12.045
But everything is so money-oriented.

27:12.254 --> 27:14.087
They like to advertise it.

27:14.295 --> 27:16.628
They want to talk about money help.

27:16.837 --> 27:19.878
They want to say that this is happening because

27:21.711 --> 27:23.420
if they had more money,

27:23.628 --> 27:27.003
they would have taken more drugs.

27:27.670 --> 27:30.419
Because they have no money, that’s why they are thieving.

27:30.586 --> 27:34.087
So we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

27:35.503 --> 27:38.212
or they can take to this kind of life.

27:38.419 --> 27:40.962
On the whole, if you see,

27:41.170 --> 27:43.212
people have lived

27:43.419 --> 27:46.170
with something which is so unreal

27:46.379 --> 27:49.379
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

27:49.545 --> 27:53.170
And when it comes to facing it,

27:53.379 --> 27:55.753
that we’ve done a mistake,

27:55.962 --> 27:58.920
we should not have done this mistake;

27:59.795 --> 28:01.837
then they retreat

28:02.045 --> 28:05.129
and take another glorious

28:05.337 --> 28:08.503
image, artificial and unreal,

28:08.711 --> 28:12.170
saying  “Oh, we are great, we are martyrs.”

28:17.212 --> 28:22.003
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga

28:22.212 --> 28:27.087
where everything that is ignoble, everything that is to be detested,

28:27.295 --> 28:31.461
everything from which we should have protection will become

28:31.670 --> 28:36.212
the goal of people to achieve.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.795
I hope you have understood

28:40.003 --> 28:44.379
that the All-Pervading Power around us

28:44.545 --> 28:47.254
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

28:47.420 --> 28:49.795
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

28:50.003 --> 28:53.419
and is the one who has given you blessings,

28:53.586 --> 28:54.878
is Paramachaitanya.

28:57.045 --> 28:59.795
Through which it has worked out.

29:00.003 --> 29:04.545
So today’s prayer should be that we be more and more aware

29:04.753 --> 29:08.795
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya

29:09.003 --> 29:11.461
and that we can feel that,

29:11.670 --> 29:15.753
we can use that power, we can work it out.

29:15.962 --> 29:18.711
If it is felt today that way,

29:18.920 --> 29:22.337
I think lot of work has been done already

29:22.503 --> 29:24.337
and may God bless you for that.

30:38.670 --> 30:40.003
Now.

30:42.628 --> 30:46.379
So when you are doing this Puja, please remember

30:46.545 --> 30:49.878
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya

30:50.087 --> 30:54.254
and so you have to just think

30:54.420 --> 30:58.212
that you’re dealing with reality itself.

31:02.586 --> 31:06.003
With that understanding, you have to do this Puja.

31:13.212 --> 31:15.503
May God bless you.
