00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:23.337
Today, we should worship

00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:26.170
the Paramachaitanya,

00:00:26.345 --> 00:00:30.270
the All-pervading Power of God's Love.

00:00:42.212 --> 00:00:44.628
We are aware

00:00:45.878 --> 00:00:53.586
that Paramachaitanya does everything.

00:00:55.003 --> 00:00:57.711
At least, mentally we know

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.920
that everything is worked out

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:04.461
by the grace of Paramachaitanya,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.753
which is the power of the Adi Shakti.

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:19.087
But still,
it is not so much in our heart,

00:01:26.295 --> 00:01:30.045
so much in our attention.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.878
We can consider Paramachaitanya

00:01:37.087 --> 00:01:39.795
like a ocean,

00:01:41.379 --> 00:01:46.420
like a ocean which contains everything within itself.

00:01:47.545 --> 00:01:51.087
Everything, all the working,

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:57.461
everything, is within its own limits.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.461
So it cannot be compared with anything. You cannot compare it.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.087
Now, if you see the sun,

00:02:06.837 --> 00:02:10.170
then from the sun

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.670
the rays have to come out, to work it.

00:02:17.045 --> 00:02:21.045
If you see somebody,

00:02:23.087 --> 00:02:30.671
say, a person who has an authority,

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.020
he has to assert that power outside.

00:02:40.295 --> 00:02:46.379
So, within himself, he doesn't work it out.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.461
Say, for example, if there's a seed

00:03:00.503 --> 00:03:02.670
and inside the seed only

00:03:03.045 --> 00:03:07.670
the tree grows, and the fruits come out, and

00:03:08.545 --> 00:03:11.295
then they are sold, and people eat it, and

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:15.003
everything is inside that seed.

00:03:16.212 --> 00:03:19.379
Then that is Paramachaitanya.

00:03:21.962 --> 00:03:28.419
So, we are all enveloped in it.

00:03:30.295 --> 00:03:34.254
And only the waves that we see,

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.337
and we are on the waves,

00:03:37.503 --> 00:03:45.454
so we see it as dislocated, separated.

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:50.670
Like we feel “this is Germany”

00:03:52.711 --> 00:03:56.837
or “this is England, this is India.”

00:03:57.087 --> 00:04:04.628
These are just folds of the sari of Paramachaitanya

00:04:04.837 --> 00:04:11.003
which look separated,
but they are not separated.

00:04:12.087 --> 00:04:15.420
They are continuous.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.045
So, the connection is absolutely complete.

00:04:22.503 --> 00:04:25.795
If I pull a thread from here,

00:04:26.003 --> 00:04:30.129
the thread will throughout be pulled.

00:04:33.212 --> 00:04:37.129
In the same manner, this Paramachaitanya

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.920
is working within itself.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.003
And there is nothing without.

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:56.711
So, when you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:05:00.837 --> 00:05:04.295
it pays special attention to you.

00:05:04.545 --> 00:05:08.670
Or, I should say, it becomes absolutely

00:05:09.212 --> 00:05:11.337
one with you.

00:05:11.503 --> 00:05:20.962
Whatever you desire, whatever you want,
00:05:17,420 --&gt;
also will be coming from the same Paramachaitanya,

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.045
if you are one with it.

00:05:25.295 --> 00:05:33.419
Like in a, say, turbulent ocean

00:05:35.628 --> 00:05:39.795
some drops of water may fly into the air

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:44.337
and start thinking that, "We are above".

00:05:45.503 --> 00:05:49.795
We're away from the world, away from the ocean.

00:05:50.003 --> 00:05:53.795
But again they have to fall into the sea.

00:05:56.795 --> 00:06:01.170
So, this formless energy,

00:06:02.170 --> 00:06:07.295
which has all the intelligence, all the coordination,

00:06:07.586 --> 00:06:09.586
all the organizations,

00:06:09.795 --> 00:06:12.337
all the computers,

00:06:14.045 --> 00:06:16.379
all the televisions,

00:06:17.045 --> 00:06:21.087
all that you can think of communication

00:06:21.295 --> 00:06:24.711
and of governing, of administration,

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.670
and above all,

00:06:30.087 --> 00:06:33.420
it is the Love,

00:06:34.337 --> 00:06:37.379
it is the Love of God

00:06:38.711 --> 00:06:42.295
and love of your Mother.

00:06:47.711 --> 00:06:54.129
So, to be one with this Paramachaitanya,

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.628
you have to know

00:06:59.837 --> 00:07:03.837
that you have to become the reality.

00:07:09.003 --> 00:07:13.962
For example, if you take a photograph of mine, sitting here,

00:07:17.254 --> 00:07:22.711
Maybe My photograph might give you living vibrations- all right -

00:07:24.795 --> 00:07:27.795
though it's a photograph.

00:07:32.254 --> 00:07:37.419
But, if you take a photograph of somebody else

00:07:41.087 --> 00:07:46.628
it will not work out Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:48.753 --> 00:07:53.628
The reason is, that somebody else has not become the reality.

00:07:54.129 --> 00:07:57.254
It's like any other painting if you see,

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:00.337
supposing you see a painting

00:08:00.503 --> 00:08:03.878
where it is raining.

00:08:04.503 --> 00:08:07.503
This rain does not nourish the flowers.

00:08:07.711 --> 00:08:10.003
It does not

00:08:16.045 --> 00:08:20.087
wet the cloth of the people who are there.

00:08:20.379 --> 00:08:23.003
It is static.

00:08:23.753 --> 00:08:35.878
So, in ignorance,in ignorance, we just have the picture

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:41.337
which is static about reality.

00:08:42.878 --> 00:08:45.795
And that is the reason why

00:08:46.003 --> 00:08:52.545
we think we can work it out ourselves, everything.

00:08:53.878 --> 00:08:58.962
Now if somebody says that, "I see this picture,

00:09:00.419 --> 00:09:06.419
all right. And I'll make the rain as a real thing".

00:09:06.628 --> 00:09:12.753
You cannot. Try anything,
put whatever colour you like.

00:09:12.962 --> 00:09:17.795
It may appear, it will appear with effort.

00:09:18.003 --> 00:09:23.212
But it will not have the capacity,

00:09:26.129 --> 00:09:29.461
nor the nature of reality.

00:09:32.170 --> 00:09:35.503
So, human beings always deal

00:09:36.545 --> 00:09:42.545
with unreal things, thinking they are doing something great.

00:09:44.795 --> 00:09:47.087
We can get flowers which are real, of course.

00:09:47.295 --> 00:09:49.920
We can feel them.

00:09:53.003 --> 00:09:55.628
We can create plastic flowers.

00:09:55.837 --> 00:10:00.337
We can create paintings, exactly the same as they are.

00:10:00.503 --> 00:10:08.753
But we can't produce one flower on our own.

00:10:14.962 --> 00:10:18.461
We'll have to go to reality

00:10:19.295 --> 00:10:22.628
is that the Mother Earth is going to produce it,

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:29.545
or the Sun is going to help the Mother Earth.

00:10:34.586 --> 00:10:38.295
So, all of you Sahaja Yogis

00:10:40.753 --> 00:10:48.254
have to know, that in reality, you do not do anything

00:10:48.670 --> 00:10:52.045
and everything is done by Paramachaitanya.

00:10:52.419 --> 00:10:57.170
This is the difference between a non-Sahaja Yogi and a Sahaja Yogi.

00:10:57.379 --> 00:11:02.420
A non-Sahaja Yogi does not know.

00:11:03.962 --> 00:11:08.628
And even if he knows, this is not

00:11:08.837 --> 00:11:11.545
the truth in his heart.

00:11:11.753 --> 00:11:14.670
It's not a part and parcel of his being.

00:11:14.878 --> 00:11:19.419
But a Sahaja Yogi knows that

00:11:20.129 --> 00:11:23.129
reality is Paramachaitanya

00:11:23.337 --> 00:11:27.379
and it is reality that works out everything.

00:11:29.503 --> 00:11:32.670
And then this reality is

00:11:32.878 --> 00:11:35.962
the Divine Love.

00:11:37.586 --> 00:11:40.920
We always separate love from action.

00:11:41.837 --> 00:11:52.920
To us, love means
some sort of a mad behaviour towards a person.

00:11:55.170 --> 00:11:59.419
It has no technical know-how, how to love.

00:12:00.254 --> 00:12:04.670
It works without any understanding.

00:12:06.503 --> 00:12:09.295
When we love somebody,

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:13.419
we don't know, what do we do?

00:12:14.419 --> 00:12:17.170
We think we love you.

00:12:17.379 --> 00:12:20.586
Tomorrow we start saying, "I hate you".

00:12:21.129 --> 00:12:24.129
So, how can it be love?

00:12:27.962 --> 00:12:31.962
We love our own children, love our own family,

00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:35.670
love our own friends,

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:38.878
which is so unreal.

00:12:40.087 --> 00:12:42.670
If it was real,

00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.628
it would never have failed.

00:12:48.419 --> 00:12:50.962
That you cannot definitely say

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:53.753
that, all right, today you'll work for your son

00:12:53.962 --> 00:12:56.670
and be very selfish about your son.

00:12:56.878 --> 00:12:59.129
But you can't say tomorrow how he will treat you

00:12:59.337 --> 00:13:02.003
or you'll treat him.

00:13:05.962 --> 00:13:09.003
But Paramachaitanya knows,
it knows how to express its love.

00:13:15.628 --> 00:13:17.878
Not only that,

00:13:18.087 --> 00:13:22.586
but it's an eternal feeling of love,

00:13:25.087 --> 00:13:28.878
which may change its hue, colour,

00:13:32.503 --> 00:13:39.837
but the concern of that love will be the same.

00:13:40.045 --> 00:13:43.837
The essence of love is concern.

00:13:44.878 --> 00:13:48.461
Even if, supposing, somebody does wrong,

00:13:48.670 --> 00:13:52.295
the concern of the Divine would be to correct that person.

00:13:52.461 --> 00:13:55.003
Concern.

00:13:55.379 --> 00:14:01.337
Or if we say as "hita, is the benevolence.

00:14:01.503 --> 00:14:04.129
So the concern for the benevolence

00:14:04.337 --> 00:14:06.461
will be all the time there,

00:14:06.670 --> 00:14:11.129
whether it may appear to be, sometimes, cruel,

00:14:11.337 --> 00:14:13.837
might appear to be affectionate,

00:14:14.045 --> 00:14:16.087
might appear to be over-indulgent.

00:14:16.295 --> 00:14:19.962
Whatever it may take a form, like a wave.

00:14:20.920 --> 00:14:24.379
Whichever way it may look, but actually,

00:14:25.087 --> 00:14:28.003
it's for your benevolence.

00:14:29.003 --> 00:14:32.295
It works for your benevolence.

00:14:32.878 --> 00:14:35.295
Not only your benevolence,

00:14:35.461 --> 00:14:39.170
but the collective benevolence.

00:14:41.254 --> 00:14:44.878
And it knows very well what is to be done

00:14:45.087 --> 00:14:47.962
how it is to be worked out.

00:14:50.087 --> 00:14:53.254
It does not have to go and learn from anywhere

00:14:53.420 --> 00:14:56.878
because the complete knowledge of all this know-how

00:14:57.087 --> 00:15:00.337
also is within itself.

00:15:03.254 --> 00:15:12.962
It's such a storage of wisdom, knowledge and love.

00:15:15.003 --> 00:15:18.129
So, it does not deviate.

00:15:18.419 --> 00:15:22.878
Once you become a Sahaja Yogi, the concern

00:15:24.795 --> 00:15:28.212
for your benevolence

00:15:28.419 --> 00:15:31.670
is all the time there.

00:15:31.962 --> 00:15:36.586
Whether you are punished or not is a different point.

00:15:36.962 --> 00:15:40.254
Some people might get a job.

00:15:40.420 --> 00:15:43.795
Some people will not get a job.

00:15:44.003 --> 00:15:45.920
With some people it will work out this way.

00:15:46.129 --> 00:15:49.045
With some people it will not work out that way.

00:15:49.254 --> 00:15:51.503
Then one may say that, "How is it, this Paramachaitanya

00:15:51.711 --> 00:15:53.503
is behaving like this?"

00:15:53.711 --> 00:15:55.628
It' s all for your correction.

00:15:55.837 --> 00:16:03.739
It's a big churning whatever works out for your correction
and is for your benevolence.

00:16:03.545 --> 00:16:05.628
If you understand this point,

00:16:05.837 --> 00:16:09.337
then you'll never be disappointed in your life.

00:16:16.254 --> 00:16:19.628
And it has no concern

00:16:19.837 --> 00:16:22.170
of its own benevolence,

00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:26.337
because it is complete benevolence itself.

00:16:29.129 --> 00:16:33.420
It never thinks how it is going to be benevolent

00:16:34.379 --> 00:16:39.878
or helpful, because it has no botheration about it.

00:16:40.087 --> 00:16:44.129
A man, say, who has everything,

00:16:44.337 --> 00:16:46.129
worldly things,

00:16:46.337 --> 00:16:49.003
still may be concerned about getting more,

00:16:49.212 --> 00:16:51.503
the greed, there would be.

00:16:51.711 --> 00:16:55.420
But as it is the complete, Purna,

00:16:56.545 --> 00:16:58.920
it has no greed.

00:17:00.795 --> 00:17:04.045
It's fully satisfied with itself.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:07.878
And because it is so powerful,

00:17:08.503 --> 00:17:10.837
so knowledgeable,

00:17:11.045 --> 00:17:17.379
that it has no doubts, no doubts of any kind.

00:17:18.461 --> 00:17:25.212
And because there's nobody which can harm it,

00:17:25.503 --> 00:17:28.503
it has no fear.

00:17:32.795 --> 00:17:36.503
And you all have now felt

00:17:36.795 --> 00:17:40.878
that Paramachaitanya,

00:17:42.419 --> 00:17:47.295
should give you a complete fearless life,

00:17:47.461 --> 00:17:50.420
a peaceful life,

00:17:50.962 --> 00:17:53.170
and a joyous life.

00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:58.586
Like a child who finds his mother, then he stops crying,

00:18:00.628 --> 00:18:02.837
no more, now he's found his mother.

00:18:03.045 --> 00:18:07.045
In the same way, you have found Paramachaitanya

00:18:07.254 --> 00:18:10.045
and the connection with it.

00:18:10.379 --> 00:18:14.420
So, you don't have to worry for anything,

00:18:15.212 --> 00:18:17.003
don't have to think about anything,

00:18:17.212 --> 00:18:19.670
you don't have to plan about anything.

00:18:20.045 --> 00:18:22.295
Only thing is, you have to jump into it,

00:18:22.461 --> 00:18:25.545
just jump into it,

00:18:26.962 --> 00:18:32.170
and know that you have become part and parcel of the reality.

00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:40.503
This if you have understood, I think, we have done a big job.

00:18:43.419 --> 00:18:46.295
Now we are in Germany,

00:18:46.461 --> 00:18:49.586
and you know in Germany

00:18:49.795 --> 00:18:53.045
there have been people who have

00:18:54.419 --> 00:18:58.419
tried to shatter the hopes of human beings.

00:18:59.795 --> 00:19:02.003
But

00:19:02.212 --> 00:19:05.962
even that happening that took place,

00:19:06.586 --> 00:19:10.628
all those horrible things happened, that so many people died,

00:19:10.837 --> 00:19:14.087
of course they are born again, no problem,

00:19:14.545 --> 00:19:17.586
and such problems came up

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:29.379
that they were thinking that
the whole world will be finished.

00:19:30.545 --> 00:19:32.586
They were so much worried,

00:19:32.795 --> 00:19:35.962
they thought that the whole world will be finished.

00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.379
But did not.

00:19:39.545 --> 00:19:43.753
But this war has taught us a lesson.

00:19:46.545 --> 00:19:49.753
It has made us more collective.

00:19:50.337 --> 00:19:53.379
It has made us understand each other.

00:19:54.337 --> 00:19:57.628
Otherwise, how do you come out of the ignorance

00:19:57.837 --> 00:20:01.170
that, "Wwe are this country”, we are that country".

00:20:01.545 --> 00:20:03.420
Racialism.

00:20:03.628 --> 00:20:08.586
Then this so-called nationalism, so-called patriotism,

00:20:08.795 --> 00:20:17.129
all these separating forces, divisive things.

00:20:18.045 --> 00:20:22.795
So, clearly, we are all human beings,

00:20:24.295 --> 00:20:27.878
and we should be treated as human beings.

00:20:28.545 --> 00:20:32.254
If you see the history, after every war

00:20:32.420 --> 00:20:38.670
there has been a speedy movement towards knowledge,

00:20:39.003 --> 00:20:42.419
knowledge of oneness of the world.

00:20:43.586 --> 00:20:51.379
It is something
like, you have in a spacecraft,

00:20:51.545 --> 00:21:00.586
that a container is built in,
one into another,

00:21:02.295 --> 00:21:12.711
and the whole thing
comes into a speed, some velocity.

00:21:13.795 --> 00:21:20.837
And then the lower container bursts or explodes.

00:21:21.045 --> 00:21:28.045
When it explodes, it gives a higher speed
to the rest of it.

00:21:28.878 --> 00:21:33.920
And so, the acceleration of the velocity takes place.

00:21:34.419 --> 00:21:38.419
And that's how one can go into the space.

00:21:40.003 --> 00:21:42.837
In the same manner,

00:21:43.045 --> 00:21:46.545
all these horrible things that have happened

00:21:47.254 --> 00:21:59.003
are explosions
which brings you towards knowledge

00:21:59.254 --> 00:22:01.212
that there's something wrong with us,

00:22:01.419 --> 00:22:05.129
we are living with something unreal.

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:11.461
Now the problems, today's problems as they are,

00:22:17.586 --> 00:22:35.212
like ecology problem, AIDS, drugs,
all these modern problems and poverty,

00:22:36.295 --> 00:22:42.503
if you see it like a witness, you will see
these are quite shocking.

00:22:43.628 --> 00:22:46.045
These are very shocking things.

00:22:46.254 --> 00:22:50.753
And all these shocking things should really shock our mind,

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:54.461
should really shock our mind.

00:22:55.212 --> 00:22:58.420
Why we have these problems?

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:05.129
And these problems, some of the stupid leaders think

00:23:05.337 --> 00:23:08.878
that we can solve by making more money.

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.170
We can protect ourselves
from ecology if we have more money.

00:23:15.045 --> 00:23:19.212
And that we can pollute the atmosphere

00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:21.420
because we will have more money.

00:23:21.628 --> 00:23:24.212
And then we can protect ourselves.

00:23:24.419 --> 00:23:29.503
So that everybody will have to have a mask,
moving about all over the place.

00:23:29.878 --> 00:23:34.295
But we should make more money to protect ourselves.

00:23:34.461 --> 00:23:38.295
Doesn't matter if there is ecological problem, doesn't matter.

00:23:39.254 --> 00:23:47.962
So, you move about like a person who is entering
into the area which is all full of fumes.

00:23:51.129 --> 00:23:54.003
All these stupid ideas come up because

00:23:54.212 --> 00:23:59.420
they do not see that, what is human dignity is,

00:24:00.545 --> 00:24:08.753
that human beings are above everything else
- above machinery,

00:24:08.962 --> 00:24:12.920
above all material things of the world.

00:24:13.795 --> 00:24:17.795
They will not talk that, "We'll balance the machinery". No.

00:24:18.628 --> 00:24:24.337
What they will talk that, "We'll make a man
a greater slave of the machinery

00:24:24.503 --> 00:24:26.419
because he must have money".

00:24:26.586 --> 00:24:30.254
He must have more money, and with this more money,

00:24:30.420 --> 00:24:34.545
we can protect ourselves against this ecological problem.

00:24:34.878 --> 00:24:37.337
It is absurd.

00:24:38.628 --> 00:24:42.379
But if you understand the human dignity,

00:24:42.711 --> 00:24:48.953
then you have to understand that
as a human being,

00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:56.045
we have to take a very positive,

00:24:56.254 --> 00:25:00.670
wise step to stop all the nonsense we have been doing.

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:17.920
Like, now most of the French shores
the beaches, are polluted.

00:25:18.419 --> 00:25:20.420
Naturally.

00:25:21.087 --> 00:25:25.545
Because they started a funny thing
called "holiday making" on the seashore.

00:25:26.503 --> 00:25:28.295
So, this is the result.

00:25:28.461 --> 00:25:30.419
Now, do what you please!

00:25:30.586 --> 00:25:33.878
You cannot do all that. It has stopped.

00:25:34.087 --> 00:25:36.419
So, instead of - now human brain is such -

00:25:36.628 --> 00:25:39.962
instead of understanding that we have done something wrong,

00:25:40.170 --> 00:25:46.020
"Oh", they will say, "We will start some new method
of cleansing this".

00:25:46.254 --> 00:25:50.995
They will never condemn
what has gone wrong with them,

00:25:51.170 --> 00:25:58.251
that they have become so addicted to this kind of a
funny life that they have on the seashores.

00:25:58.795 --> 00:26:00.670
Now, AIDS.

00:26:00.878 --> 00:26:03.920
You'll be amazed that in America

00:26:04.461 --> 00:26:11.503
why, even they said that,
there were in Los Angeles, itself,

00:26:11.837 --> 00:26:19.212
700 000 people
who glorified themselves as martyrs of AIDS,

00:26:19.419 --> 00:26:23.254
because they are achieving such a great goal

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:32.128
of leading a life which is nonsensical,
as if like a big revolution.

00:26:33.212 --> 00:26:40.503
And thinking that they are very, very
great revolutionaries, great people,

00:26:40.878 --> 00:26:51.625
that they are supporting this AIDS
disease and glorifying it.

00:26:52.920 --> 00:27:03.920
Can you believe that this kind of
assertion will be accepted?

00:27:05.337 --> 00:27:08.170
People will laugh at you.

00:27:09.087 --> 00:27:12.045
But everything is so money-oriented.

00:27:12.254 --> 00:27:14.087
They like to advertise it.

00:27:14.295 --> 00:27:16.628
They want to talk about money help.

00:27:16.837 --> 00:27:19.878
They want to say that, "This is happening because

00:27:21.711 --> 00:27:23.420
if they had more money,

00:27:23.628 --> 00:27:27.003
they would have taken more drugs.

00:27:27.670 --> 00:27:30.419
Because they have no money, that's why they are thieving".

00:27:30.586 --> 00:27:34.087
So, we must give them money so that they can take drugs,

00:27:35.503 --> 00:27:38.212
or they can take to this kind of life.

00:27:38.419 --> 00:27:43.212
On the whole, if you see, people have lived

00:27:43.419 --> 00:27:49.379
with something which is so unreal
all their lives, absolutely unreal.

00:27:49.545 --> 00:27:55.770
And when it comes to facing it,
that we've done a mistake,

00:27:55.962 --> 00:28:01.837
we should not have done this mistake,
then they retreat,

00:28:02.045 --> 00:28:08.509
and take another glorious
image, artificial and unreal,

00:28:08.711 --> 00:28:12.170
saying, "Oh, we are great, we are martyrs".

00:28:17.212 --> 00:28:22.003
And this is what is, what we call is Kali Yuga,

00:28:22.212 --> 00:28:27.087
where everything that is ignoble,
everything that is to be detested,

00:28:27.295 --> 00:28:36.261
everything from which we should have protection,
will become the goal of people to achieve.

00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:42.795
I hope you have understood that
that the All-pervading Power around us

00:28:44.545 --> 00:28:47.254
is the one that is doing Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:49.795
is the one that has brought you to Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:50.003 --> 00:28:54.819
and is the one who has given you blessings,
is Paramachaitanya,

00:28:57.045 --> 00:28:59.795
through which it has worked out.

00:29:00.003 --> 00:29:04.545
So, today's prayer should be that we be more and more aware

00:29:04.753 --> 00:29:08.795
that we are part and parcel of that Paramachaitanya,

00:29:09.003 --> 00:29:11.461
and that we can feel that,

00:29:11.670 --> 00:29:15.753
we can use that power, we can work it out.

00:29:15.962 --> 00:29:18.711
If it is felt today that way,

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:22.337
I think lot of work has been done already

00:29:22.503 --> 00:29:24.337
and may God bless you for that.

00:30:38.670 --> 00:30:46.379
Now.
So when you are doing this puja, please remember

00:30:46.545 --> 00:30:49.878
that you are worshipping Me as Paramachaitanya.

00:30:50.087 --> 00:30:54.254
And so you have to just think

00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:58.212
that you're dealing with reality itself.

00:31:02.586 --> 00:31:06.003
With that understanding, you have to do this puja.

00:31:13.212 --> 00:31:15.503
May God bless you.
