WEBVTT

00:00.665 --> 00:06.213
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:19.270 --> 00:28.013
Actually we are all seeking the truth.
So many of us,

00:28.214 --> 00:37.441
but so far, so many couldn't find and they
are lost.

00:37.642 --> 00:44.032
But what is the truth? What is the truth
about yourself?

00:44.233 --> 00:54.453
The truth is that you are not this body,
you are not these emotions

00:54.654 --> 01:02.038
but what are you? You are the spirit.

01:02.239 --> 01:11.603
All the great saints and incarnations have
said that you are the spirit

01:11.804 --> 01:19.364
and what we are trying to find out is our
selfhood.

01:19.565 --> 01:26.216
We are after that research about ourselves.

01:26.417 --> 01:33.153
We've done lots of mistakes also
by misguided people

01:33.354 --> 01:44.512
but I must say that there is a built-in
arrangement within us, every one of you,

01:44.713 --> 01:55.369
which will take you to that selfhood,
which will give you that self-realization.

01:55.570 --> 02:04.608
It's very surprising that they have not
talked about Kundalini so far.

02:04.824 --> 02:14.933
There is a power within all of you which
is the Kundalini,

02:15.134 --> 02:21.029
which is three and a half coiled energy

02:21.230 --> 02:35.812
in your, I should say, behind your
triangular bone, or it is inside it

02:36.013 --> 02:42.455
and is waiting for that moment when it can
be awakened

02:42.656 --> 02:47.982
and it can pass through the different
centers

02:48.160 --> 02:54.401
piercing through your fontanel bone area.

02:54.602 --> 03:00.455
And that's how you get your
self-realization,

03:00.656 --> 03:07.393
that you feel cool breeze coming out
of your fontanel bone area.

03:07.594 --> 03:12.708
It's an actualization. It is not My lecture

03:12.909 --> 03:19.085
or reading or anything. It's actualization
which has to take place.

03:19.286 --> 03:25.823
If you don't get it, doesn't matter. Next
time you can get it,

03:26.024 --> 03:31.927
but most of them do get it in a collective
way. It's very surprising

03:32.128 --> 03:38.616
that it took so much, so many years
for people

03:39.040 --> 03:46.308
to come to this state where they are asking
for the real thing.

03:46.509 --> 03:52.055
This is your own. This power is your own.

03:52.256 --> 03:56.727
And it is just waiting there to be
awakened.

03:56.928 --> 04:06.482
Any amount of lecturing, any amount
of reading, nothing can help you.

04:06.683 --> 04:16.257
What is needed is just a quiet mind and
it works.

04:16.458 --> 04:21.963
It works under every circumstances.
It's very surprising,

04:22.164 --> 04:30.320
this was the time perhaps, was meant to be
this way.

04:31.165 --> 04:36.419
I've been to this country many a times
before also.

04:36.620 --> 04:40.572
First time when I came, I was so surprised

04:40.773 --> 04:47.251
how people were running after falsehood.
So I gave it up.

04:47.452 --> 04:54.055
After nine years I came, thinking that
what's the matter with these people?

04:54.256 --> 04:58.644
Why can't they understand what they have
to achieve? What they have to get?

04:58.845 --> 05:07.036
Whatever is written and said by all
the saints, by all the incarnations.

05:07.237 --> 05:16.852
I couldn't understand why they were
satisfied with all kinds of nonsense.

05:17.053 --> 05:25.363
And somehow they came to America and
prospered here with all their untruth.

05:25.564 --> 05:33.529
It's very sad that we have lost so many
beautiful seekers in their pursuit.

05:33.730 --> 05:40.028
Now I have to tell you one thing, simple
thing, that you must know

05:40.229 --> 05:45.657
that you have every right to know yourself,

05:45.858 --> 05:50.427
to become self-realized, every one of you.

05:50.628 --> 05:58.545
Nobody can force it and nobody can deny it.

05:58.746 --> 06:06.563
It is your fundamental right by which you
can get your self-realization.

06:06.764 --> 06:10.435
If you are a human being that's sufficient,

06:10.636 --> 06:16.779
whether you belong to America, or to India
or to any other place,

06:16.980 --> 06:23.320
everyone has this right, to get your
self-realization.

06:23.521 --> 06:30.867
As a result of self-realization what
happens, that's the point.

06:31.068 --> 06:39.217
Firstly, you start feeling the Divine
vibrations on your fingertips.

06:39.418 --> 06:47.584
Divine vibrations like cool breeze and it
starts flowing through your hands.

06:47.785 --> 06:54.013
You'll be amazed when it first happens, you
start doubting.

06:54.214 --> 06:58.975
I know people who went and closed their
doors and windows,

06:59.176 --> 07:04.603
wanted to test and find out if they had
those cool breeze.

07:04.804 --> 07:17.719
You have it. It's a sign of yourself
emitting these pure vibrations.

07:17.920 --> 07:22.554
As a result of that so many other things
can happen.

07:22.755 --> 07:30.749
But the most important thing is that you
become a very peaceful person.

07:31.868 --> 07:35.872
You become a very balanced person

07:36.073 --> 07:43.492
and you become that witness about which
all the religions have talked.

07:43.693 --> 07:51.555
You get to the state of that witness. And
once you become the witness,

07:52.063 --> 08:01.873
you see the whole picture, the whole world
in a very different manner.

08:02.074 --> 08:10.209
You become the witness. It's a state
in which, watch everything.

08:10.409 --> 08:20.115
You do not react but you watch and your
presence itself will help people.

08:20.316 --> 08:26.918
I know America nowadays is in a very

08:28.880 --> 08:35.053
difficult state and people are quite
frightened type.

08:35.254 --> 08:39.730
If they were realized souls they would
never have been.

08:39.931 --> 08:45.759
The power of realization is so great, not
that it enlightens you

08:45.960 --> 08:51.883
but it enlightens others, it enlightens
the atmosphere.

08:52.084 --> 08:58.940
So it’s very important that you get your
last breakthrough of your evolution

08:59.141 --> 09:05.488
and get to that state which we call as
self-realization.

09:05.689 --> 09:13.023
It is a entry into the Divine powers

09:13.224 --> 09:20.720
and this spiritual realm of life which is
very, very surprisingly,

09:20.921 --> 09:28.458
very much surprisingly is very difficult
to understand otherwise.

09:28.659 --> 09:35.171
But once you become a realized soul
automatically you know what it is.

09:35.372 --> 09:42.583
You become so sensitive, at the same time
you are so well protected.

09:42.784 --> 09:46.745
You can solve many problems.

09:46.946 --> 09:53.441
You can do so many things which you could
never have been able to do.

09:53.642 --> 09:59.726
The reason is, now you have become
empowered by the Divine force.

09:59.927 --> 10:04.921
This is what you all are seeking, nothing
else.

10:05.122 --> 10:11.465
This is what you want, nothing else. And
this is what you should get it.

10:11.666 --> 10:20.728
No use going into blind place and trying

10:20.929 --> 10:27.016
to find out something which you do not
know.

10:27.240 --> 10:32.959
With this, your health will improve,

10:33.824 --> 10:41.708
your wealth will improve, your temperament
will improve

10:41.909 --> 10:48.461
and you'll become such a compassionate,
such a beautiful person

10:48.662 --> 10:55.777
that people will be amazed how you have
achieved this state.

10:55.978 --> 11:01.634
You become so collective. So very
collective.

11:01.835 --> 11:08.534
I am surprised how this collective
temperament has come into

11:08.735 --> 11:14.072
all the Sahaja yogis, how they work it out.

11:14.273 --> 11:21.923
It's very beautiful and surprisingly you
may belong to any, any country,

11:22.124 --> 11:29.530
far away from each other, where the people
don't know each other

11:29.731 --> 11:33.593
and such love and such understanding.

11:33.794 --> 11:39.920
This is beyond Me sometimes, you see, how
beautifully

11:40.121 --> 11:46.206
they blend together, mix together and learn
from each other.

11:46.407 --> 11:55.619
Such love, such compassion and such power
is then your own, your own.

11:55.820 --> 12:02.895
You don't have to pay for it. You don't
have to do anything of the kind;

12:03.096 --> 12:08.042
just you have to get your Kundalini
awakened.

12:08.243 --> 12:14.153
which is very, very easy to do and it works
out.

12:14.354 --> 12:20.727
The time has come, I think, for en-mass
awakening, the time has come

12:20.928 --> 12:24.934
and that's why, well we have to work it
out.

12:25.135 --> 12:30.314
It's not something miraculous, I think.

12:30.515 --> 12:37.187
If you see our evolution: from what stage
to what stage to what stage.

12:37.388 --> 12:43.357
Now at a human stage what do we have
to achieve?

12:43.558 --> 12:50.815
Why are we human beings? What is the part
we have to play?

12:51.016 --> 12:54.726
Because you are a spiritual personality.

12:54.927 --> 12:58.732
You have to become that spiritual
personality.

12:58.933 --> 13:06.632
It's not by reading books or doing all
kinds of rituals that you will achieve it.

13:06.832 --> 13:13.011
It’s just within yourself where
the Kundalini rises,

13:13.212 --> 13:18.118
passes through these various centers and
gets you connected

13:18.319 --> 13:24.376
to the Divine power which is all pervading,
which is everywhere.

13:24.577 --> 13:31.389
Then you can learn what is this, how it
works, how it helps you,

13:31.610 --> 13:36.494
how it educates you, and how it gives you
knowledge.

13:36.695 --> 13:42.307
It's really remarkable and it works
in every country.

13:42.515 --> 13:48.860
It's very surprising that people told me
that in America it will never work.

13:49.061 --> 13:56.875
I said, "Why?" "Because they are only after
gurus

13:57.091 --> 14:02.781
and would take money and make big things".
I said, "All right.

14:02.982 --> 14:08.379
After all they are human beings. And as
human beings

14:08.702 --> 14:17.352
all their ideas will change. And they will
seek their peace and joy".

14:17.723 --> 14:22.968
I must say that today in America it has
worked out wonders.

14:23.175 --> 14:29.330
In all the cities here, we have people who
are following Sahaja Yoga.

14:29.531 --> 14:38.304
Everyone who has come to Me is just
the same

14:38.505 --> 14:47.294
as any other Sahaja yogi who is from any
other country. Can you believe it?

14:47.524 --> 14:49.921
There's no difference at all

14:50.122 --> 14:55.685
in their expression, in their love,
in their compassion.

14:55.909 --> 15:02.310
All of them are so good and so beautiful.

15:02.511 --> 15:08.658
It is hard to believe that they've
forgotten all the differences.

15:08.859 --> 15:11.872
And how have they mixed up together

15:12.057 --> 15:18.532
and are in such a loving state and
enjoyable state.

15:18.733 --> 15:26.653
It's a very different area into which you
have to enter and you enter into it,

15:26.854 --> 15:32.828
without doing anything whatsoever, only
your Kundalini rises

15:33.029 --> 15:38.138
and gives your self-realization. It is
effortless.

15:38.339 --> 15:44.326
Don't have to make any efforts, not
standing on your head or anything.

15:44.527 --> 15:49.044
Just wherever you are sitting, you get your
self-realization.

15:49.245 --> 15:55.227
And once you get it, you grow into it.
You grow into it so well.

15:55.428 --> 16:03.043
You become so empowered. You are amazed
sometimes.

16:03.244 --> 16:09.767
You see people who were never poets;
they've suddenly become poets.

16:10.003 --> 16:16.646
There are people who never could do
anything on the stage, were so frightened,

16:16.847 --> 16:19.508
have become great speakers.

16:19.709 --> 16:25.677
There are musicians who said, "Mother,
we didn't know how to sing".

16:25.878 --> 16:30.681
So all kinds of creativity comes into it.

16:30.882 --> 16:35.755
How it comes and how suddenly it has
started they don't know.

16:35.956 --> 16:41.260
You become extremely creative and you start
appreciating

16:41.461 --> 16:47.788
in a very subtle way the creativity
of others.

16:48.947 --> 16:54.708
Then, this stupid thing called greed,

16:54.909 --> 17:01.387
which has captured your country now, also,
is like this:

17:01.588 --> 17:08.958
that when people get some money, the taste
of that money makes them greedy.

17:09.131 --> 17:15.612
As simple as that. Now what happens with
Sahaja Yoga,

17:15.813 --> 17:23.864
you don't have any greed. The greed
finishes. You are a satisfied soul.

17:24.065 --> 17:34.079
Why will you ask for so many cars, so many
aeroplanes? Not needed.

17:34.280 --> 17:39.556
Because you become a wise person, become,
becoming is the point.

17:39.757 --> 17:47.717
You become so wise that you don't hanker
after things.

17:47.918 --> 17:53.556
You are extremely satisfied. But as
a result of that

17:53.757 --> 18:01.060
you are completely, fully blessed

18:01.261 --> 18:09.024
with a very beautiful life and everything
that you want is there.

18:09.225 --> 18:13.299
This is the blessings of the Divine

18:13.500 --> 18:19.154
and so many miracles. So many miracles
that you are amazed

18:19.355 --> 18:24.216
how are you blessed. What have you done
to deserve this?

18:24.417 --> 18:31.556
You are now the spirit. These are
the blessings of the spirit.

18:31.757 --> 18:35.964
People get completely cured, no doubt,

18:36.165 --> 18:42.992
but also they become very compassionate,
extremely compassionate.

18:43.193 --> 18:47.014
And they don't understand from where did
they get this compassion,

18:47.215 --> 18:51.574
very compassionate people.

18:51.923 --> 18:59.475
Thirdly, they become thoughtlessly aware.

18:59.676 --> 19:04.041
That means complete silence within.

19:04.242 --> 19:13.058
You see something and you become silent.
You don't react, just you see.

19:13.259 --> 19:17.396
So enjoyable to see something clearly.

19:17.597 --> 19:25.121
But when you see something, your vibrations
act.

19:25.322 --> 19:31.333
It's a very powerful personality that when
you see something

19:31.534 --> 19:36.098
your vibrations act and they work it out.

19:36.299 --> 19:40.906
They can solve all kinds of problems.

19:41.107 --> 19:47.595
These vibrations can tell you what's wrong
with the other person,

19:47.796 --> 19:55.112
what's wrong with certain countries. And
also you should know how to correct it.

19:55.313 --> 20:05.228
If you can find out how you can correct
this, problem is solved.

20:05.429 --> 20:09.301
And it's so gentle and so sweet

20:09.502 --> 20:15.069
that you don't have to fight with this,
it just works.

20:15.270 --> 20:20.998
You're all capable of becoming that
powerful person,

20:21.199 --> 20:26.054
of that compassion, of that love and
understanding

20:26.255 --> 20:34.243
and you just develop this thoughtless
awareness, which is a very important state,

20:34.444 --> 20:40.631
which you don't feel bored, you don't get
upset,

20:40.832 --> 20:45.327
you're absolutely silently watching
everything

20:45.544 --> 20:49.483
and you become such a congenial personality

20:49.684 --> 20:56.811
that those who come in contact with you
also become very, very congenial.

20:57.012 --> 21:03.044
You can give realizations to others. You
yourself can do it.

21:03.245 --> 21:10.346
It's not only that you get your realization
but you can give realization.

21:10.547 --> 21:18.892
It's very surprising that you become so
powerful. You can change the atmosphere.

21:19.093 --> 21:25.112
You can work out so many things just with
turning of your mind

21:25.313 --> 21:35.750
and all the bad things like, we should say,
all the things that are very destructive,

21:35.951 --> 21:40.808
you just don't like it, just give up like
that.

21:41.009 --> 21:46.977
And also you protect yourself. You are
completely protected

21:47.178 --> 21:49.668
from all the evil doers.

21:49.869 --> 21:55.683
So is important that you become that
powerful personality

21:55.884 --> 22:00.996
which I call as the spiritual person.
People have been talking about it,

22:01.197 --> 22:05.822
saying all kinds of things. They read all
kinds of stories.

22:06.023 --> 22:10.144
Now the time has come for
the actualization.

22:10.345 --> 22:17.998
And this is so important, so very important
for you, that you get it.

22:18.199 --> 22:22.715
The time has come. It's your right, it's
your fundamental right, I say,

22:22.916 --> 22:27.160
to get to that state where you become

22:27.361 --> 22:32.783
absolutely a personality which is
spiritual,

22:32.984 --> 22:43.373
which is empowered and which knows how to,
how to use this power, how to work it out.

22:43.574 --> 22:53.665
It's very surprising how the more advanced
we are, the less chances there are,

22:53.866 --> 22:58.231
because we are lost, lost in the forest
of advancement.

22:58.432 --> 23:05.185
But despite all that, people find it so
difficult

23:05.386 --> 23:10.679
to exist in such busy atmosphere,

23:10.880 --> 23:16.050
they come to Sahaj and they get completely
peaceful.

23:16.251 --> 23:22.716
Whatever it is, whatever kind of life it
is, they are absolutely peaceful.

23:22.917 --> 23:29.814
And you give peace to others. I have spoken
for thousands of times

23:30.015 --> 23:37.104
all over the world and I think it works.
It does work.

23:37.305 --> 23:41.292
They wanted Me to allow you to ask some
questions.

23:41.493 --> 23:45.264
I don't mind you asking Me questions

23:45.465 --> 23:55.065
but the problem is, this questioning also
can be quite stupid sometimes.

23:57.345 --> 24:03.096
If you want to waste sometime on certain
amount of stupidity, you can ask Me,

24:03.297 --> 24:06.903
I don't mind.

24:09.680 --> 24:15.071
So, if somebody wants to ask Me questions?

24:26.731 --> 24:37.159
So have you got some people who want to ask
questions? No. All right.

24:37.360 --> 24:43.961
So now, we'll have the session for
self-realization.

24:44.162 --> 24:47.686
It's very simple.

24:52.452 --> 24:59.781
What you have to do is to put both your
hands like this towards Me.

25:25.983 --> 25:28.475
All right.

25:32.615 --> 25:35.173
Now,

25:38.655 --> 25:43.210
please close your eyes. Please all of you
close your eyes.

25:43.411 --> 25:49.229
There's no mesmerism. So please close your
eyes.

26:24.480 --> 26:30.111
First put your left hand towards Me

26:30.312 --> 26:37.236
and right hand on top of your head
on the fontanel bone area,

26:37.437 --> 26:40.670
left hand towards Me.

26:43.045 --> 26:45.778
Now,

26:47.035 --> 26:50.529
put the right hand towards Me

26:52.776 --> 27:02.886
and put the left hand on top of your head
not touching the head, above.

27:09.498 --> 27:16.097
Not both the hands, one on top of your
head, only one.

27:17.910 --> 27:21.480
Keep your eyes shut.

27:29.304 --> 27:31.692
Now,

27:32.921 --> 27:38.349
all those who are feeling cool breeze
in your hand

27:38.550 --> 27:43.833
try to see that it comes on top of your
hand, not below.

27:44.034 --> 27:46.948
If it is coming below just push it up.

27:47.149 --> 27:51.512
You can open your eyes and see.

28:01.054 --> 28:06.679
First, put both your hands towards Me
again,

28:08.074 --> 28:12.955
see, if you are feeling a cool breeze
in your hands

28:13.156 --> 28:18.824
or you are feeling a cool breeze coming
out of your head.

28:19.025 --> 28:26.693
Could be hot, could be hot. If it is hot,
try to forgive people.

28:27.009 --> 28:31.162
Could be hot but doesn't matter.

28:52.998 --> 29:01.825
All those who have felt cool or hot breeze
coming into their hands

29:02.026 --> 29:06.009
or out of their fontanel bone area,

29:06.210 --> 29:11.184
please raise your hands, both your hands.

29:12.315 --> 29:15.339
Don't be afraid.

29:32.297 --> 29:38.560
Most of you, most of you have felt it.

29:39.472 --> 29:42.947
May God bless you.

29:46.179 --> 29:52.934
How many of you have not felt, please
raise your hands.

30:00.635 --> 30:03.983
Hardly any.

30:12.166 --> 30:20.725
Very surprising. Very happy to see that
most of you have felt the cool breeze.

30:20.926 --> 30:24.594
May God bless you.

30:25.406 --> 30:28.428
Thank you very much.
