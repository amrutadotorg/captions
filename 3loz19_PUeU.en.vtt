00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:07.129
Now what about the brain?

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:12.949
And of course the brain is important because
if you can show that meditation leads to different

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.020
activation of the brain then you have proof
that it's not just thinking but that it's

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:17.759
something else.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.899
Then you prove that you actually in fact entering
an altered state of consciousness and that's

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:25.040
crucially important.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.390
So there have been several brain imaging studies.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.390
This is a study done by Simon Guruchayki for
Washington University and what he showed is

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.180
when people meditate there is activity, a
very slow wave of activity coming from the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:47.110
limbic system called Theta activity.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:54.040
This activity is there when you are in deep
focussed attention, and has been associated

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.579
with creativity.

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:59.870
And this activity is focussed on our frontal
and grital areas which are areas

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.020
of deep attention.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.000
The next study was a study using MRI which
is a better resulted study, and which I was

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.740
involved in and this was done by Doctor Sergio
Hernandez, and that's him.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:16.159
So he used this MRI scanner to input people.

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:22.650
In the scanner they had to meditate for I
think about twenty minutes and in the initial

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.180
stages of meditation, the meditators activated
the same region we've seen before.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.380
So the right frontal lobe and the temporal
lobe.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:36.580
So this is an especially key area for deep
attention and also for inhibition, because

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:38.530
when you start to meditate you inhibit your
thoughts.

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.770
So you activate this area of inhibition.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.500
But what is interesting is it was in both
sides of the hemispheres, but as they went

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.740
deeper into meditation, the activation became
progressively more reduced.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:56.939
Then as they go into a deep state of meditation,
there is hardly any activity left in the brain.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:01.210
They just have a little bit of activity here
on the right at the frontal lobe, which is

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.530
this area of deep attention.

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.100
So in other words in meditation, you achieve
a state of deep attention-of concentrated,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.400
relaxed activity - which is mediating a deep
concentration.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.250
What they also measured then was the effect.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.060
As people stop having thoughts, they feel
joy, they feel bliss.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.660
As they feel more and more bliss, again they
get this theta activity, which comes from

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.150
the limbic system.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.230
It focuses over the left frontal lobe, which
is a key area for positive emotions.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:42.239
So, essentially, what the studies are showing
are that in fact, when you meditate, you activate

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.700
areas of attention and of positive emotions.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.989
This is of course the objective correlate
of this Sanskrit denomination of meditation.

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.000
Which is Sat Chit Ananda.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.379
Which means Being Pure Attention and Pure
Joy.

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:03.660
Just to show you here, the limbic system-the
limbic system consists of seven nuclei, which

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.230
is also interesting as we have seven chakras.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.940
And this is the limbic system deep in the
brain, so this is what we activate when we're

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.450
in meditation and it gives you joy and happiness.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:24.000
Another very important thing Doctor Simon
Guruchayki found is that when people

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.480
meditate, there is less mental clutter.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.650
And the slide is a bit bad I apologise for
that.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.890
But essentially, this is showing chaotic compexity.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.440
In the brain you have all this complex, chaotic
firing, but if you have less chaotic firing

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.659
it means you have less mental clutter.

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.700
And this chaotic firing, as I said before
the mental clutter is increased in people

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:47.440
with schizophrenia, depression, Autism, ADHD.

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:50.520
And these are normal people during rest and
these are the meditators.

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:55.440
So the meditators have significantly less
mental clutter and that is very important,

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.560
because it means they have better mental balance.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.580
This is not Sahaja Yoga meditation, but some
people found that people who practice Zen

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:13.239
Buddhism have not just-what I showed you before
was the activation of the brain-this is the

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.129
structure of the brain, so these are long
term effects on the structure of the brain.

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:23.749
So, long term Buddhist meditators have a thicker
cortex in the same region we've seen before,

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:28.969
which are activated which are these attention
areas, especially this area here, right frontal

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:30.099
region.

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:35.770
And furthermore what's very important, they
have, normally, the thickness of this cortex

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:37.599
reduces progressively with age.

00:04:37.599 --> 00:04:42.200
So these are the normals-but in the meditators,
this process is delayed.

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:49.059
So this suggests that meditation is anti-aging,
and actually leads to a delay of the normal

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:51.319
aging process of those attention regions.

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:55.330
And of course, if you think about it, meditation
is attention training.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:02.330
Where you sit for half an hour and you actually
concentrate and try to inhibit your thoughts.

00:05:03.569 --> 00:05:08.199
So what happens at the chemical level in the
brain.

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:09.719
And I think this is becoming very exciting.

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:16.110
We have in the brain, so-called 'opioid receptors'
and they're called 'opioid receptors' because

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:23.500
opium binds to them, morphine binds to them,
and these opioids, you can also release from

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.460
within.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:30.369
And Beta endorphines, they attach to these
opioids receptors and Beta endorphins are

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:36.249
released when you're in love or when you do
sports, but are also released through meditation.

00:05:36.249 --> 00:05:45.200
And this is very interesting because this
could explain why people feel the joy and

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:46.259
the happiness.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:50.610
Apart from the activation of the limbic system
that we've shown before, but it's also because

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:53.349
you release happy chemicals in the brain.

00:05:53.349 --> 00:06:00.349
What is interesting as well is those opioids
of course, those Beta endorphines, they enhance

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:04.610
the immune system and they have shown to slow
down cancer cells.

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:10.520
So this could explain why some people can
be cured with meditation from severe diseases

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.189
like cancer, because if you have a continuous
release of Beta endorphines, which strengthen

00:06:15.189 --> 00:06:20.550
your immune system, and slow down cancer cells,
then this can easily explain it.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:26.550
And therefore this is not a miracle cure,
but actually, can be explained.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:34.700
Other studies have shown that meditation releases
dopamine, this is also release through cocaine

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:36.089
or amphetamines.

00:06:36.089 --> 00:06:41.830
So this is another drug which is important-another
substance which is important for feeling pleasure.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:46.770
So this explains where people who meditate
actually get addicted to meditation.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.679
Because you get this constant high in your
brain without paying all the side effects

00:06:51.679 --> 00:06:54.339
of drugs.

00:06:54.339 --> 00:07:00.080
And other meditations have show that there
is an increase in serotonin-this is a drug

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.949
which is typically lower in depression, so
this could explain why many meditators are

00:07:04.949 --> 00:07:06.629
less likely to be depressed.

00:07:06.629 --> 00:07:11.849
Melatonin, which is important for sleep and
also strengthens the immune system, so again

00:07:11.849 --> 00:07:17.889
this could again explain why people, when
they meditate, they find they can sleep far

00:07:17.889 --> 00:07:22.199
easier, and again, we can enhance the immune
system.

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:26.800
And GABA which is important for cognitive
functions like attention and there is a decrease

00:07:26.809 --> 00:07:29.729
in stressfulness.

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:40.770
So the last study I want to talk about on
the brain section is actually a study which

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:45.409
was the very first to prove that meditators
are more detached.

00:07:45.409 --> 00:07:50.009
And I like this study a lot because it is
the only one that tried to prove this point.

00:07:50.009 --> 00:07:54.249
And this was done again by Doctor Simon Guruchaykin
from Washington University.

00:07:54.249 --> 00:07:59.489
What it did, he showed meditators and non-meditators
a really horrible movie which is called 'Funny

00:07:59.489 --> 00:08:02.029
Games' by Michael Harniker.

00:08:02.029 --> 00:08:07.900
If you've seen that movie, it's-I've
not been able to watch it, but actually it's

00:08:07.939 --> 00:08:13.610
supposed to shock you, and to show the violence
in our society.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:19.279
So it's a movie of two psychopathic teenagers
which go into a house and they kill everybody.

00:08:19.279 --> 00:08:24.529
They start with the dog, then the woman, then
the kids, then the father.

00:08:24.529 --> 00:08:30.909
So this movie is really quite terrible, and
they showed this movie to these poor people,

00:08:30.909 --> 00:08:37.419
and as you can see, the blue are the controls,
and the red are the meditators, and-at the

00:08:37.419 --> 00:08:43.379
subjective psychological level, these are
all negative emotions, so the controls have

00:08:43.379 --> 00:08:44.850
far more negative emotions.

00:08:44.850 --> 00:08:50.730
So they felt more disgust, more anxiety, more
sadness, more unhappiness, after watching

00:08:50.730 --> 00:08:51.600
the movie.

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.660
And the red ones are the meditators, so they
had much less negative emotions than the non-meditators.

00:08:57.660 --> 00:09:02.769
Then they measured on the skin-when you're
stressed, you have more sweat on the skin-so

00:09:02.769 --> 00:09:05.320
you can measure the level of stress in the
body.

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:12.480
And at the skin level, the meditators had
siginificantly less skin response than the

00:09:12.490 --> 00:09:18.959
controls, so at the body level the meditators
also were less affected by this negative movie.

00:09:18.959 --> 00:09:25.699
Lastly he measured the brain, and this is
the gamma activity-Gamma activity is released

00:09:25.699 --> 00:09:28.500
when you have very intense emotions.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:33.529
So during the rest, the meditators and the
controls didn't differ, but after the movie,

00:09:33.529 --> 00:09:38.660
the controls have this high Gamma activity,
this really high Gamma activity, so they were

00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.610
really stressed out at the brain level by
the movie, while the meditators kept their

00:09:43.610 --> 00:09:45.870
cool as well at the brain level.

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:50.269
So in other words, the meditators kept their
cool at the psychological level, they were

00:09:50.269 --> 00:09:55.170
less affected at the body level, and less
affected at the brain level.

00:09:55.170 --> 00:10:00.290
And this, I think is absolutely crucial, because
this is sort of proof that mediation makes

00:10:00.290 --> 00:10:07.269
you more detached and more able to cope with
stress and negative events.

00:10:07.269 --> 00:10:14.269
And as I said before, this is important because
it improves your emotional resilience.

00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:21.120
So in conclusion, the state of mental silence
is associated with relaxed brain activity

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:27.810
of deep attention and positive emotions, it
increases happy chemicals which stabilise

00:10:27.810 --> 00:10:32.420
your mood and your affect, and it makes people
more detached-at the psychological, at the

00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:37.189
brain and at the body level.

00:10:37.189 --> 00:10:40.050
Now what about the effect on your health?
