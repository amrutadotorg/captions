00:00:01.786 --> 00:00:06.906
Today is a great day for all of us,

00:00:06.906 --> 00:00:09.786
because it is the sixteenth Sahasrara Day.

00:00:20.106 --> 00:00:24.506
That in sixteen beats

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:30.226
or sixteen movements

00:00:30.466 --> 00:00:35.186
you reach a higher position in the coil.

00:00:53.026 --> 00:00:55.306
That it is complete,

00:00:57.626 --> 00:01:03.866
that Shri Krishna is called as a complete incarnation

00:01:07.986 --> 00:01:12.266
because He has sixteen petals.

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:31.586
This completeness is called as "purna."

00:01:36.666 --> 00:01:41.946
So, now we move into another dimension.

00:01:47.146 --> 00:01:57.226
The first one was where you got your Self-realization.

00:02:05.026 --> 00:02:08.626
In the evolutionary process,

00:02:08.786 --> 00:02:15.786
if you see, the animals are not conscious

00:02:15.946 --> 00:02:20.026
of many things which human beings are conscious of.

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:38.186
Like the matter cannot be used by animals

00:02:39.466 --> 00:02:42.266
for their own purpose.

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:54.906
Also they are not conscious of themselves at all.

00:02:58.386 --> 00:03:01.706
If you show a mirror to animals

00:03:01.906 --> 00:03:06.306
they do not react to it as if they are in the mirror,

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:19.386
except for, I think, chimpanzees.

00:03:23.626 --> 00:03:26.506
That means that we are rather close to them!

00:03:36.466 --> 00:03:40.146
So, when we have become human beings,

00:03:40.346 --> 00:03:44.986
we became aware in our consciousness

00:03:45.186 --> 00:03:50.626
of many things which were unconscious to the animals.

00:04:04.666 --> 00:04:10.026
So, in their brain they did not understand

00:04:10.226 --> 00:04:15.826
that they could put matter into their own use.

00:04:26.306 --> 00:04:30.986
As human beings you were all unaware

00:04:31.186 --> 00:04:36.626
of the chakras that existed within you.

00:04:46.466 --> 00:04:50.186
So your consciousness still was working

00:04:50.386 --> 00:04:53.946
halfway through unconscious

00:04:54.146 --> 00:05:01.906
working of the chakras and the conscious working of the mind.

00:05:19.746 --> 00:05:23.586
You also never felt your autonomous nervous system

00:05:23.746 --> 00:05:29.346
or your inner organs, how they're working.

00:05:39.186 --> 00:05:42.106
You did not even feel how

00:05:42.306 --> 00:05:47.466
you are getting affected by other influences.

00:05:57.106 --> 00:06:02.826
As a result of that,

00:06:03.026 --> 00:06:08.306
with the freedom that human beings achieved

00:06:08.506 --> 00:06:10.826
or were granted,

00:06:10.986 --> 00:06:15.026
they gathered all kinds of things

00:06:15.226 --> 00:06:18.706
into their brains, into their Sahasrara,

00:06:18.906 --> 00:06:22.866
without being aware of it.

00:06:42.186 --> 00:06:47.066
They used their Sahasrara, their brain

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:54.866
for all kinds of purposes which were fruitless.

00:07:04.186 --> 00:07:07.826
They were not aware, again,

00:07:07.986 --> 00:07:10.666
of the warning that Shri Krishna had given

00:07:10.866 --> 00:07:17.506
that if you use human awareness except for your ascent,

00:07:17.706 --> 00:07:21.906
you will go downward.

00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:46.346
They were told. Not that they were not told.

00:07:46.586 --> 00:07:49.386
They knew about it.

00:07:56.146 --> 00:07:59.306
Whether it was East or West, everybody knew

00:07:59.506 --> 00:08:03.266
that you have to be born again.

00:08:13.226 --> 00:08:17.786
And it so happened that in the West

00:08:17.946 --> 00:08:23.266
people thought that by using their brainpower

00:08:23.506 --> 00:08:28.026
they can now master the matter;

00:08:34.986 --> 00:08:39.626
that they can use matter for their own purpose.

00:08:41.906 --> 00:08:47.346
If they had done it after their Self-realization,

00:08:47.546 --> 00:08:52.386
it would have been a very different situation,

00:09:01.706 --> 00:09:04.026
because after Self-realization

00:09:04.226 --> 00:09:08.786
you all have become aware of vibrations,

00:09:08.986 --> 00:09:13.506
which is chaitanya, and also of your chakras.

00:09:23.826 --> 00:09:25.946
With this new awareness,

00:09:26.146 --> 00:09:30.746
you would have avoided all that was wrong.

00:09:39.946 --> 00:09:42.466
But it is like a greedy person,

00:09:42.626 --> 00:09:47.626
who gets a wee bit of money and he spends it off.

00:10:03.066 --> 00:10:10.346
Now this problem has complicated your brains.

00:10:14.386 --> 00:10:21.586
You have certain concepts, which are very much away from reality.

00:10:29.546 --> 00:10:32.866
The way we have started using machines,

00:10:33.066 --> 00:10:36.986
we have become machines ourselves.

00:10:44.386 --> 00:10:49.266
So we have no feelings and we cannot relate

00:10:49.466 --> 00:10:53.706
to others in a natural way.

00:11:03.666 --> 00:11:06.706
In human awareness you had achieved

00:11:06.906 --> 00:11:13.466
how to relate yourself to others and to the nature.

00:11:24.506 --> 00:11:27.266
But this ego-oriented approach

00:11:27.466 --> 00:11:35.386
took you away from natural, real life.

00:11:43.666 --> 00:11:47.386
And we became artificial.

00:11:50.786 --> 00:11:58.226
The whole thing comes from a concept of being artificial.

00:12:08.986 --> 00:12:16.106
Like they say that it's fashionable to be arrogant, to be snobbish.

00:12:23.666 --> 00:12:27.626
This is just the opposite of your ascent

00:12:27.786 --> 00:12:30.586
and evolutionary process

00:12:34.626 --> 00:12:41.226
because you have lost the power to relate to others,

00:12:41.386 --> 00:12:45.306
which you had gained as human beings.

00:12:55.186 --> 00:12:57.986
All the organizations which you have formed

00:12:58.186 --> 00:13:05.487
also on collective understanding are also artificial.

00:13:14.546 --> 00:13:19.586
Then a movement started that we have to be natural.

00:13:27.452 --> 00:13:33.332
That is another copying of the artificial.

00:13:38.052 --> 00:13:42.812
Natural does not mean a primitive personality.

00:13:45.292 --> 00:13:48.892
Natural is to evolve.

00:13:52.452 --> 00:13:57.292
The whole purpose of creation is to evolve.

00:13:59.452 --> 00:14:03.452
So the another concept also that you accepted very easily

00:14:03.652 --> 00:14:05.772
because you have got brains

00:14:05.932 --> 00:14:10.492
and you accept everything that comes your way.

00:14:20.132 --> 00:14:25.492
And you became so artificial that you needed all the time

00:14:25.692 --> 00:14:29.492
some sensations to feel yourself.

00:14:45.883 --> 00:14:48.243
Now in every walk of life [missing part, 20 seconds]

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.740
But that also you made so artificial

00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:03.940
that you have now your sex in your brain.

00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:18.540
By that not only you have silenced Ganesha in the Mooladhara,

00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:22.700
but also Mahaganesha in your brain.

00:15:33.300 --> 00:15:36.540
In another aspect, say art.

00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:41.980
Now the concept is so stupid

00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:51.020
that it says that art should be according to what is laid down.

00:15:55.740 --> 00:15:57.100
Whatever is laid down about art,

00:15:57.300 --> 00:16:00.500
that art should be such, such, such.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:14.940
Like you will call somebody as baroque, condemn it,

00:16:15.140 --> 00:16:20.380
then rococo, this, that. Condemn everyone.

00:16:26.980 --> 00:16:29.940
And ultimately you reach a conclusion

00:16:30.140 --> 00:16:34.260
that the most insipid thing is art.

00:16:42.820 --> 00:16:46.260
As if, like the sugarcane, when you have taken out all the juice,

00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:50.580
whatever remains will become art one day.

00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:06.140
So the brain, which does not nourish the heart

00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:12.700
is absolutely an artificial brain, just like a robot.

00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:24.260
So people have become just like robots.

00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:31.500
Now this can be handled by anyone

00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:35.100
who has a mastermind.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.860
Because you don't have your own heart

00:17:42.100 --> 00:17:45.980
and the brain is controlled by somebody

00:17:46.220 --> 00:17:50.900
who has a greater brain of concepts.

00:18:00.500 --> 00:18:06.100
All these concepts are destructive.

00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:34.260
Say Hitler got the concept that he is an Aryan

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:38.620
and he is of the superior race.

00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:48.940
And to establish that, he did not mind

00:18:49.140 --> 00:18:51.300
destroying the whole world.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:06.460
Same is the case in the religion field.

00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:19.540
There also, every religion was put

00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:25.860
or poured into the cups of concepts.

00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:41.380
Now the worst concept that human beings have achieved,

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.780
is that money is everything.

00:19:55.020 --> 00:19:59.460
First they tried for political domination,

00:19:59.660 --> 00:20:05.380
thinking that political domination is everything.

00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:16.740
And now they feel that money is everything

00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:22.980
and all other sublime things are imaginary.

00:20:41.900 --> 00:20:48.620
So, when I started My life,

00:20:48.820 --> 00:20:54.460
I saw the complicated Sahasraras.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.340
And the more I tried to solve the complications

00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:15.780
within My own awareness,

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:22.620
the more it became more difficult.

00:21:36.180 --> 00:21:43.740
Because if you see My age, in fifty years

00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:51.300
you can see how much complicated human beings have become.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:08.300
And after opening the Sahasrara, when I come to the West,

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.660
within these sixteen years

00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:16.700
I found that they are now incorrigible.

00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.420
Now the stage for you is laid down

00:22:44.620 --> 00:22:47.820
to ascend higher.

00:22:55.100 --> 00:23:01.460
This is the background which I have described to you.

00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:09.980
And you can see how, when you have a program,

00:23:10.220 --> 00:23:14.220
there will be 500 people for the program

00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.940
and within two weeks all will disappear.

00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:31.860
Because when the ascent takes place,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:36.340
the Kundalini pushes out the ego

00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:41.860
and brings the person close to reality.

00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:56.500
But again that ego, which is being built up so fast

00:23:56.660 --> 00:24:00.220
in its speed, overpowers the speed

00:24:00.420 --> 00:24:04.620
of the Kundalini and covers the head.

00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:31.620
Then it suggests that, "how can you have godly life?"

00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.940
You will miss all the alcohol, all the madness,

00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:41.300
all the fun of life.

00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:51.740
That they feel, they will lose all the freedom to become mad.

00:24:57.180 --> 00:25:01.300
When you see from this position

00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:06.420
the way people react, it is amazing.

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:22.020
You have to do something extremely stupid

00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:25.380
to sell it in the market.

00:25:32.860 --> 00:25:39.100
The other day I heard that somebody has become rich

00:25:39.300 --> 00:25:48.100
selling the empty tins as lamps.

00:25:57.780 --> 00:26:00.780
All kinds of stupid things,

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:06.660
which are nowhere near natural beauty

00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:13.180
or natural joy, are accepted as sophisticated.

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:30.140
The other side of it is that the asuri vidya,

00:26:30.300 --> 00:26:37.340
the black vidya has taken over.

00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:57.700
As Shri Krishna again had warned that,

00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:01.980
in the fifteenth chapter, that if asuri vidya takes over,

00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.220
then the suddha vidya cannot compete

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:09.420
with the speed of asuri vidya.

00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:30.100
Like in America there has been a big

00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.300
argument amongst Sahaja Yogis

00:27:32.523 --> 00:27:38.043
if My photograph should be in the drawing room or not.

00:27:50.716 --> 00:27:54.366
But if you ask them to paint their nails black,

00:27:54.396 --> 00:27:59.396
their faces black and black clothes like witches, they will do it.

00:28:10.516 --> 00:28:14.156
That even at the stage when we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:28:14.356 --> 00:28:20.236
we are shy of our godly life.

00:28:28.396 --> 00:28:31.916
When they became hippies or when they became punks

00:28:32.116 --> 00:28:35.556
or they became anything like that stupid,

00:28:35.796 --> 00:28:37.036
they gave all their life,

00:28:37.236 --> 00:28:40.556
all their time, all their money to it.

00:28:46.316 --> 00:28:49.156
They changed their dresses, they changed their lifestyles,

00:28:49.356 --> 00:28:55.076
they changed their family life, everything they changed, went all out.

00:29:00.796 --> 00:29:04.436
I mean, and even when Sahaja Yogis are convinced about

00:29:04.636 --> 00:29:10.716
the godliness of Sahaja Yoga, still they are shy.

00:29:21.296 --> 00:29:24.238
Now you know your Mother doesn't take any money from you,

00:29:24.327 --> 00:29:27.447
on the contrary She spends, you all have gained out of it.

00:29:27.472 --> 00:29:32.632
But when it comes to giving, everybody feels shy.

00:29:51.992 --> 00:30:00.072
From that background you are coming to the light of God's grace.

00:30:09.472 --> 00:30:11.432
But you don't want to dash at it,

00:30:11.592 --> 00:30:15.992
you want to take your time, gradually,

00:30:16.232 --> 00:30:22.672
so gradually that maybe you may lose your chance.

00:30:32.032 --> 00:30:35.872
So in the awareness of Sahaja Yogis

00:30:36.072 --> 00:30:39.392
where you know all about your chakras,

00:30:39.592 --> 00:30:45.272
you know about vibrations, you know how you relate to others,

00:30:45.472 --> 00:30:53.232
still all this knowledge is for personal advantages.

00:31:04.512 --> 00:31:09.552
So, the shadow of the past still lingers on,

00:31:09.752 --> 00:31:15.312
even when you have this new awareness.

00:31:24.512 --> 00:31:26.832
Animals can swim automatically,

00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:28.792
they don't have to learn.

00:31:28.992 --> 00:31:32.872
But human beings have to learn to swim.

00:31:37.712 --> 00:31:41.792
So they had forgotten the techniques which were known to the animals

00:31:42.032 --> 00:31:46.912
and have taken to the techniques of human beings.

00:31:53.232 --> 00:31:55.912
But in Sahaja Yoga you have got

00:31:56.152 --> 00:31:59.952
your realization in one lifetime.

00:32:05.472 --> 00:32:09.312
And in this lifetime you have to grow.

00:32:12.792 --> 00:32:17.832
And in this lifetime you have to achieve the highest.

00:32:21.792 --> 00:32:25.152
So the time is so very short!

00:32:26.032 --> 00:32:29.552
And the background is so dark.

00:32:30.552 --> 00:32:33.832
You are surrounded by people who are pouring out

00:32:33.992 --> 00:32:38.592
morning till evening destructive concepts.

00:32:42.792 --> 00:32:47.392
Now, you are the people who have to shoot out

00:32:47.552 --> 00:32:50.952
much faster than all of them.

00:32:56.672 --> 00:33:00.952
But a kind of a lethargy, though you understand

00:33:01.192 --> 00:33:05.992
that your awareness is very different from them,

00:33:06.232 --> 00:33:10.832
a kind of a lethargy, which does not accept it

00:33:11.032 --> 00:33:14.952
the way it should accept Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:32.392 --> 00:33:36.752
Every one of you must think every day:

00:33:36.952 --> 00:33:41.752
What have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:33:50.396 --> 00:33:53.516
But you are all still very busy with your jobs,

00:33:53.716 --> 00:33:57.356
of making money, of have relations with people

00:33:57.556 --> 00:34:01.156
who do not matter at all in Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:15.036 --> 00:34:19.556
We have to make an all out effort

00:34:19.756 --> 00:34:23.556
to rise to that point, that whatever we know,

00:34:23.796 --> 00:34:26.596
we believe in, we act on that

00:34:26.796 --> 00:34:30.156
and become one with it.

00:34:45.596 --> 00:34:48.956
You can do that with concepts, but not with reality,

00:34:49.156 --> 00:34:56.516
this is the problem, I mean ... I'll explain this point.

00:35:03.316 --> 00:35:09.156
Like supposing a fanatic believes

00:35:09.356 --> 00:35:13.676
that he can do such and such thing

00:35:13.876 --> 00:35:18.076
in his own religion, he will do it.

00:35:38.677 --> 00:35:40.957
When the concept is not reality,

00:35:41.157 --> 00:35:44.157
it has given no benefit to anyone,

00:35:44.397 --> 00:35:50.037
has shown no performance of any substance

00:35:50.237 --> 00:35:52.957
still people do it.

00:36:09.237 --> 00:36:14.317
I see in My own country when they were fighting for freedom,

00:36:15.317 --> 00:36:18.277
My father himself gave up all his property,

00:36:18.477 --> 00:36:24.637
gave up his practice, with eleven children in the family.

00:36:24.837 --> 00:36:29.557
And we were living in palaces, started living in huts,

00:36:29.757 --> 00:36:33.797
for days together, for years together.

00:36:54.637 --> 00:36:58.437
But for the gross freedom we'll do anything,

00:36:58.637 --> 00:37:00.757
but for the subtler freedom

00:37:00.957 --> 00:37:05.717
the Sahaja Yogis have to do everything that is possible.

00:37:06.558 --> 00:37:10.706
So, the first thing is to realize, to be aware,

00:37:10.826 --> 00:37:16.346
to be in your conscious mind all the time that you are yogis.

00:37:28.675 --> 00:37:33.115
You are the ones who are very much higher

00:37:33.315 --> 00:37:36.875
than the rest of the humanity.

00:37:43.275 --> 00:37:50.515
That the salvation of the whole of the humanity depends on you.

00:37:55.235 --> 00:38:00.835
The purpose of creation will be served by you.

00:38:07.475 --> 00:38:09.835
So, first of all you have to be conscious

00:38:10.035 --> 00:38:14.395
in your consciousness that you are so important,

00:38:14.595 --> 00:38:18.755
and that's why you were given realization.

00:38:27.115 --> 00:38:29.835
How can you be living with your conditionings

00:38:30.035 --> 00:38:33.275
and with your ego?

00:38:40.195 --> 00:38:42.035
The conditionings are like this:

00:38:42.195 --> 00:38:45.035
Supposing you are coming from a Christian religion,

00:38:45.235 --> 00:38:47.235
then you must bring that

00:38:47.435 --> 00:38:50.315
little bit of that religion into Sahaja Yoga.

00:38:50.515 --> 00:38:52.395
Or if you are from a Hindu religion,

00:38:52.595 --> 00:38:55.515
you want to bring some out of that.

00:39:06.675 --> 00:39:10.555
We have all the essences of these in Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:10.755 --> 00:39:16.115
the pure essences; but we can't have the gross nonsense.

00:39:27.315 --> 00:39:34.635
All these things are like dirt over

00:39:34.835 --> 00:39:39.355
our Sahasrara which must be shaken off.

00:39:53.915 --> 00:39:56.235
Though now you are aware,

00:39:56.435 --> 00:40:01.315
you are aware and conscious of your chakras,

00:40:01.515 --> 00:40:05.075
you do not keep them clean.

00:40:14.835 --> 00:40:17.155
Ordinary human beings if they have clothes,

00:40:17.355 --> 00:40:21.075
they have houses, they try to keep it clean.

00:40:26.235 --> 00:40:28.315
But you do not feel ashamed

00:40:28.515 --> 00:40:31.675
of them also when they are bad,

00:40:31.875 --> 00:40:34.475
because after some time

00:40:34.675 --> 00:40:38.075
you also lose the awareness of them.

00:40:49.075 --> 00:40:52.475
That means you have become subtler,

00:40:52.675 --> 00:40:59.235
but in your consciousness you are not yet subtle.

00:41:14.355 --> 00:41:19.155
There are so many things you know more

00:41:19.355 --> 00:41:24.395
than the people who are not realized,

00:41:24.595 --> 00:41:28.515
as absolute reality.

00:41:38.315 --> 00:41:43.635
For example: We don't even use vibrations.

00:41:47.555 --> 00:41:51.315
Whenever it is needed, we don't use it.

00:41:53.315 --> 00:41:57.315
Or sometimes mechanically, just like a machine,

00:41:57.515 --> 00:42:00.715
we start giving bandhans.

00:42:06.675 --> 00:42:13.595
So you are still unconscious about your chakras.

00:42:18.595 --> 00:42:21.555
Slightly conscious when you put your mind to it,

00:42:21.715 --> 00:42:24.235
otherwise, in your central nervous system

00:42:24.395 --> 00:42:27.995
you are not yet so conscious.

00:42:41.835 --> 00:42:46.155
This is the reason, why you do not know

00:42:46.315 --> 00:42:54.035
why you had to do a thing at a particular time.

00:43:09.355 --> 00:43:14.315
Unless and until you rise to this Nirvikalpa state,

00:43:14.515 --> 00:43:17.835
you cannot go further.

00:43:28.835 --> 00:43:32.755
For example, I know everything what I do.

00:43:36.875 --> 00:43:42.435
I can handle any power whenever I want to.

00:43:46.915 --> 00:43:50.555
I can absorb any negativity I want to,

00:43:50.755 --> 00:43:55.595
I need not absorb any negativity I don't want to.

00:44:02.795 --> 00:44:05.555
You may be thousands of miles away from Me,

00:44:05.755 --> 00:44:09.075
I know about everyone of you.

00:44:16.075 --> 00:44:19.435
I may not know your worldly names,

00:44:19.635 --> 00:44:24.835
but I know you as a part and parcel in My Being.

00:44:34.275 --> 00:44:40.355
I also can behave like a human being,

00:44:42.915 --> 00:44:47.235
absolutely like you, aging like you,

00:44:50.075 --> 00:44:53.275
even using spectacles,

00:44:55.075 --> 00:45:02.275
doing all the things that will make Me a complete human being.

00:45:07.715 --> 00:45:12.675
I have accepted this role consciously,

00:45:13.675 --> 00:45:16.075
not unconsciously.

00:45:16.315 --> 00:45:19.675
To Me, nothing is unconscious.

00:45:20.595 --> 00:45:27.115
So if you have to be conscious of what you are doing,

00:45:27.275 --> 00:45:30.155
you have to be alert about it.

00:45:43.475 --> 00:45:48.075
The first thing that you have achieved is the peace,

00:45:48.235 --> 00:45:50.195
the peace.

00:45:53.195 --> 00:45:56.595
But even now I find that peace

00:45:56.795 --> 00:46:01.275
which would become joy becomes the quarrel.

00:46:11.715 --> 00:46:16.675
Truth is one, you cannot argue about truth.

00:46:21.075 --> 00:46:23.715
It is a homogeneous thing.

00:46:24.315 --> 00:46:28.075
It doesn't quarrel with each other.

00:46:34.555 --> 00:46:37.795
We are unconscious about our fingers,

00:46:38.035 --> 00:46:40.090
but when we have to hold something,

00:46:40.115 --> 00:46:44.475
all of them come together and work it out.

00:46:54.675 --> 00:46:59.275
So the part of the brain, which is working this out,

00:46:59.475 --> 00:47:04.515
the unconscious part of it, is to be made conscious.

00:47:04.715 --> 00:47:08.515
That is what evolution is.

00:47:29.355 --> 00:47:40.378
So now adherence to any concept is against evolution.

00:47:52.555 --> 00:47:56.075
You must learn to face the reality,

00:47:56.275 --> 00:48:03.235
to accept the reality and act a real way.

00:48:16.154 --> 00:48:19.234
Now you may say, "Mother, this is a miracle."

00:48:19.474 --> 00:48:22.714
Something happens, "this is a miracle."

00:48:26.554 --> 00:48:29.394
Maybe for the human beings,

00:48:29.594 --> 00:48:32.794
maybe for Sahaja Yogis also,

00:48:38.594 --> 00:48:40.714
but not for Me

00:48:40.914 --> 00:48:43.714
'cause I know what it is.

00:48:44.594 --> 00:48:52.114
So to rise above this half-baked consciousness,

00:48:52.314 --> 00:48:59.794
one has to see how you are working it out.

00:49:18.114 --> 00:49:22.554
The whole system of relating to

00:49:22.754 --> 00:49:26.314
each other must change completely.

00:49:39.274 --> 00:49:44.034
That is very important, at least for western people.

00:49:45.594 --> 00:49:48.714
Because at least in India people know

00:49:48.874 --> 00:49:51.674
that human efforts lead you nowhere,

00:49:51.874 --> 00:49:54.794
you have to take to your ascent -

00:49:54.994 --> 00:49:57.874
I mean the real Indians.

00:50:13.074 --> 00:50:16.154
Some of them do take advantage of Sahaja Yoga

00:50:16.354 --> 00:50:20.674
and then disappear, some of them do.

00:50:28.754 --> 00:50:32.874
But mostly they know that you have to be

00:50:33.074 --> 00:50:38.394
conscious of what you have got.

00:50:52.394 --> 00:50:57.754
So, we can say that we have got self-knowledge,

00:50:57.954 --> 00:51:01.394
but we haven't got self-consciousness.

00:51:17.834 --> 00:51:20.394
Now, for example, you take somebody's name,

00:51:20.602 --> 00:51:23.642
say of some great saint.

00:51:23.802 --> 00:51:27.402
You feel the vibrations are flowing.

00:51:27.602 --> 00:51:32.602
Also you know why - because he is a saint.

00:51:40.402 --> 00:51:42.882
But why not you the Sahaja Yogis?

00:51:43.082 --> 00:51:47.402
If your names are taken, why not the vibrations flow?

00:51:59.682 --> 00:52:03.882
And in this you have greater advantages

00:52:04.082 --> 00:52:07.002
because the Adi Shakti, Herself, is before you.

00:52:07.242 --> 00:52:11.922
They didn't have anybody to tell them all these things.

00:52:18.442 --> 00:52:24.482
But the disadvantage of that is this: that you take it for granted.

00:52:42.562 --> 00:52:46.522
Sometimes French is small, sometimes so big.

00:52:50.602 --> 00:52:56.842
Now, in expression, when we say something,

00:52:57.002 --> 00:52:59.882
when we express; are we natural,

00:53:00.082 --> 00:53:03.402
are we it doing from our heart?

00:53:12.762 --> 00:53:17.762
The consciousness that "I'm doing it from my heart,"

00:53:17.962 --> 00:53:21.362
is what I want you to achieve.

00:53:33.082 --> 00:53:36.842
Like there are people who work very hard in Sahaja Yoga,

00:53:37.042 --> 00:53:40.642
others will just take it for granted.

00:53:46.642 --> 00:53:49.882
They do not want to help.

00:53:51.082 --> 00:53:54.562
They want everything to be ready-made.

00:53:56.282 --> 00:53:58.642
That shows that they are not conscious

00:53:58.842 --> 00:54:03.002
of their own powers of enjoyment.

00:54:11.162 --> 00:54:13.602
If they do it from their heart,

00:54:13.802 --> 00:54:21.242
then they will never feel what effort they have put in,

00:54:21.482 --> 00:54:25.802
they will only feel what they have been blessed with

00:54:26.002 --> 00:54:28.962
or what they have achieved.

00:54:48.282 --> 00:54:53.122
The sense of fulfillment and satisfaction will overcome

00:54:53.282 --> 00:54:57.722
all your problems, specially your left Vishuddhis.

00:55:08.402 --> 00:55:10.802
Now the second stage would be

00:55:11.002 --> 00:55:16.802
where you will be conscious of whatever you are doing,

00:55:27.922 --> 00:55:31.682
where there will be no mistakes.

00:55:31.707 --> 00:55:33.762
Whatever you will do

00:55:33.962 --> 00:55:38.482
may appear to be a mistake, will turn out to be all right.

00:55:45.954 --> 00:55:48.714
Nobody is so far like that, so I would like to tell you.

00:55:48.907 --> 00:55:52.827
Because some people do feel whatever I say of praising,

00:55:53.027 --> 00:55:56.187
they think I'm saying it to them.

00:56:08.227 --> 00:56:12.307
Now for example, today I had My watch,

00:56:12.507 --> 00:56:16.667
I wanted to set My watch, so I pulled this screw up,

00:56:16.827 --> 00:56:19.507
say, simple thing.

00:56:25.267 --> 00:56:28.387
Now this I did, I would say, in a way unconsciously,

00:56:28.587 --> 00:56:31.947
but quite consciously.

00:56:36.227 --> 00:56:40.547
Because watch stopped and I knew the time,

00:56:40.787 --> 00:56:43.707
what time I have to be there for puja.

00:56:51.187 --> 00:56:56.347
So consciously I put Myself against Myself.

00:57:07.387 --> 00:57:13.987
If the watch had not stopped, I would have come earlier.

00:57:17.027 --> 00:57:21.147
But that was not the time I had to come.

00:57:25.227 --> 00:57:31.027
So I had to pull the screw to keep it stopped.

00:57:39.227 --> 00:57:42.667
So whatever mischief you play,

00:57:42.867 --> 00:57:46.947
you know and you can play it against yourself also.

00:57:54.107 --> 00:57:56.827
And then you can make a drama.

00:57:57.427 --> 00:58:02.387
"Oh, I made a mistake!" and things like that, for nothing at all.

00:58:08.667 --> 00:58:12.987
But such a stage is far off. I must tell you.

00:58:15.867 --> 00:58:20.107
Just now the stage at which we are,

00:58:20.307 --> 00:58:22.867
we are still making lots of mistakes

00:58:23.067 --> 00:58:27.587
because we are not Self-conscious.

00:58:39.947 --> 00:58:41.907
In a gross way we understand

00:58:42.107 --> 00:58:43.947
this word self-consciousness like this:

00:58:44.147 --> 00:58:46.187
When a person has to go for an interview

00:58:46.387 --> 00:58:48.267
then, he selects his suit properly,

00:58:48.467 --> 00:58:50.587
he'll comb his hair properly before going,

00:58:50.827 --> 00:58:55.467
he'll clear his throat. Self-conscious.

00:59:05.347 --> 00:59:08.227
But when it is the question of your ascent,

00:59:08.427 --> 00:59:11.987
are we alert? Or we are taking it for granted

00:59:12.187 --> 00:59:15.347
that Mother is just now going to give us a nice bath,

00:59:15.547 --> 00:59:19.107
put us in the cradle and take us there.

00:59:19.636 --> 00:59:23.276
This is being childish!

00:59:29.796 --> 00:59:34.116
You have to mature in your ascent.

00:59:40.676 --> 00:59:44.476
Now you may say, "What should we do?"

00:59:45.596 --> 00:59:50.396
Face yourself every day!

00:59:53.956 --> 00:59:58.516
In reality, see how much time you spend about

00:59:58.716 --> 01:00:04.556
mundane worries and how much about your ascent.

01:00:25.516 --> 01:00:29.476
Have you left everything, all your worries

01:00:29.676 --> 01:00:33.156
to God Almighty?

01:00:37.876 --> 01:00:43.916
Have you completely jumped out of your background?

01:00:48.156 --> 01:00:55.916
Have you come out all the way, leaving everything that was nonsensical?

01:01:06.556 --> 01:01:10.476
And how do I relate to others?

01:01:10.676 --> 01:01:16.716
How do I talk to others who are Sahaja Yogis?

01:01:21.916 --> 01:01:27.996
I am surprised sometimes, if the one Sahaja Yogi is attacked

01:01:28.196 --> 01:01:31.476
by a non-Sahaja Yogi that

01:01:31.676 --> 01:01:38.436
a Sahaja Yogi group should support a non-Sahaja Yogi.

01:01:55.116 --> 01:01:58.316
Or a Sahaja Yogi who has to come up

01:01:58.476 --> 01:02:02.036
pays more attention to the negative people

01:02:02.276 --> 01:02:05.596
than to the positive.

01:02:19.516 --> 01:02:22.396
He relates better to the people who are negative

01:02:22.596 --> 01:02:25.276
than to the people who are positive.

01:02:28.476 --> 01:02:31.956
He is more friendly and open with the negative persons

01:02:32.156 --> 01:02:34.876
than with the positive.

01:02:41.100 --> 01:02:45.260
You have to cling on to the positive.

01:02:47.940 --> 01:02:54.540
But it's always the other way round because also is a very subtle ego in there.

01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:04.300
All these subtle understandings

01:03:04.540 --> 01:03:07.580
I have told you many a times.

01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:20.460
But with your complicated brain, which is like a machine,

01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:23.620
like a spoiled computer,

01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.380
you can reach some conclusions

01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:31.540
out of what I have said which are just contrary.

01:03:47.460 --> 01:03:50.820
Like, supposing I say, "You forget the past."

01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.260
A simple thing.

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:59.940
That means you forget everything that is good of the past?

01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:04.780
That is as if you should not understand

01:04:04.980 --> 01:04:08.020
why you're behaving like this?

01:04:13.820 --> 01:04:19.020
Forget the past means don't allow the past to overpower you.

01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:30.700
A brain, which is simple, which is straightforward,

01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:34.780
which has got love in it,

01:04:34.980 --> 01:04:40.340
can understand what I am saying straightforward.

01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:55.540
This complicated brain is to be put right,

01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:03.380
and the best way is to stop thinking.

01:05:04.740 --> 01:05:08.340
Just stop thinking.

01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:13.860
That's what you have to do.

01:05:17.340 --> 01:05:24.740
Now when you stop thinking you feel that nothing can be done.

01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:36.740
But by thinking only you don't do anything.

01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:43.100
Now for example, I have to give you a speech now,

01:05:45.180 --> 01:05:48.780
but I start thinking about it, what will you hear?

01:05:48.940 --> 01:05:52.780
Can you hear My thinking?

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:03.460
You have to, say, enlighten these lights, all right?

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:06.100
Then you just start thinking about it,

01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:09.180
"I have to enlighten."

01:06:13.100 --> 01:06:17.060
Will it get enlightened?

01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:25.660
This is to be understood, that by thinking you do not do it.

01:06:32.740 --> 01:06:36.580
Thinking is lazy man's garb,

01:06:42.980 --> 01:06:46.820
and is used to avoid work.

01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:53.100
Once I asked a lady I had in the house

01:06:53.300 --> 01:06:59.060
that "We are going out. Will you be cooking something for us?"

01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.220
When we came back she had not cooked anything.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:12.940
I used to cook every day but she had not cooked anything.

01:07:13.820 --> 01:07:20.020
I said, "Why? Why didn't you cook something for us?"

01:07:21.260 --> 01:07:25.740
She said, "I thought You may eat outside."

01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:31.260
She was a western lady.

01:07:33.140 --> 01:07:38.460
So my husband said, "All right, we are going to eat outside. You stay at home."

01:07:39.740 --> 01:07:41.700
I said, "It doesn't look nice." He said,

01:07:41.900 --> 01:07:47.020
"No, let her know what she thought is meant for herself."

01:07:56.580 --> 01:08:01.060
So this is the escape which, you have learnt before,

01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:04.260
the cleverness.

01:08:14.940 --> 01:08:20.100
So you do not argue about it.

01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:23.980
Do not argue about Sahaja Yoga.

01:08:26.660 --> 01:08:30.780
You do not argue with your leaders.

01:08:32.220 --> 01:08:36.700
You may be his wife, but don't argue.

01:08:38.460 --> 01:08:41.580
We are having a very bad time from some of the wives

01:08:41.740 --> 01:08:46.540
of the leaders because they try to influence the husbands.

01:08:46.740 --> 01:08:49.340
As far as Sahaja Yoga is concerned,

01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:53.340
they have nothing to do with that.

01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.860
Supposing you are working in an office

01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.780
and the husband is some great official

01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:13.980
and you are a clerk, will you correct the husband?

01:09:25.420 --> 01:09:31.860
In this case the women have to nourish the organization,

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:37.940
nourish the husband with love

01:09:45.460 --> 01:09:49.700
from their heart and not from their brains.

01:09:57.300 --> 01:10:03.780
I think it's so great to have been born as a woman Myself,

01:10:03.980 --> 01:10:10.460
because I can enjoy the heart, the emotions.

01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:26.780
The emotions of My love,

01:10:28.660 --> 01:10:33.020
the working and the play of My love.

01:10:38.260 --> 01:10:40.580
It's so great

01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:46.460
that no incarnation can enjoy that as I can.

01:10:52.660 --> 01:10:55.100
So the women should not feel degraded

01:10:55.260 --> 01:10:58.540
if they have to look after the heart,

01:11:10.100 --> 01:11:13.900
but they are in a higher, in a way,

01:11:14.060 --> 01:11:17.620
in a higher aspect.

01:11:20.620 --> 01:11:25.860
You can do without thinking but you cannot do without the heart.

01:11:28.180 --> 01:11:33.860
So the ladies should not argue

01:11:35.980 --> 01:11:40.260
with their husbands if they are leaders,

01:11:42.940 --> 01:11:47.940
and also one should not argue otherwise, also.

01:11:53.140 --> 01:11:56.780
Because I have seen if the women are very argumentative,

01:11:56.980 --> 01:11:59.140
the men become deaf.

01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:04.620
They just don't listen what women are talking.

01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:17.340
If they are very aggressive, then the men

01:12:17.540 --> 01:12:22.340
become absolutely shut up.

01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.180
So in relationship with each other,

01:12:33.380 --> 01:12:35.700
you must behave in a natural way

01:12:35.900 --> 01:12:40.820
that you are a man and you are a woman.

01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:51.420
You should become more a woman and more a man

01:12:55.220 --> 01:12:59.060
and then you will see the fun.

01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:02.900
Imagine in this world if there were only men or only women,

01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:05.620
what would have happened?

01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:21.780
So we have to know that in our awareness

01:13:21.980 --> 01:13:27.140
we have to be conscious how far we have achieved

01:13:27.340 --> 01:13:36.540
the consciousness for our relationship with each other,

01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:51.580
that is the collective consciousness of Virat, of the brain,

01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:58.660
that is of Sahasrara.

01:13:59.820 --> 01:14:07.020
So in principle Sahasrara is Vishnu Tattwa,

01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:20.660
but the Deity is Mataji Nirmala Devi.

01:14:25.460 --> 01:14:33.140
So you can see how the beautiful integration has taken place.

01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:40.820
All the powers of Shri Vishnu have to act

01:14:41.020 --> 01:14:47.100
according to the Deity, surrender at the Lotus Feet of the Deity.

01:14:53.460 --> 01:14:58.060
So the consciousness of Shri Vishnu is

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.860
absolutely in the hands of the Deity.

01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:17.180
I do not want to talk about this tremendous Deity,

01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:24.940
it's too much, because it may fill you up with awe.

01:15:36.980 --> 01:15:48.980
So, whatever is working out, allow it to work out.

01:15:56.180 --> 01:16:01.300
They say, "Surrender your Sahasrara to this Deity."

01:16:06.940 --> 01:16:10.620
And it's so, so simple for you,

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:15.220
because you have the Deity,

01:16:15.460 --> 01:16:19.900
you have your own Sahasrara, and it's only you,

01:16:20.060 --> 01:16:24.260
the people who are Sahaja Yogis today in modern times,

01:16:24.460 --> 01:16:27.300
have seen that Deity.

01:16:45.180 --> 01:16:48.420
They say that you have to ask for three things

01:16:48.660 --> 01:16:52.140
called salokya, samipya, sanidhya from God;

01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:57.620
meaning to see God, salokya;

01:16:57.820 --> 01:17:00.780
samipya, the closeness with God

01:17:00.980 --> 01:17:06.180
and sanidhya is the companionship of God.

01:17:16.060 --> 01:17:21.180
But you have got tadatmya, is oneness with Me

01:17:27.780 --> 01:17:30.940
which is not in the concept of any one

01:17:31.140 --> 01:17:36.020
of the yogis and the saints and the seers who have been before.

01:17:43.340 --> 01:17:48.940
And this tadatmya you have when you are outside My body,

01:17:55.980 --> 01:17:59.380
while they have this tadatmya when they are inside My body,

01:17:59.620 --> 01:18:02.180
they are no more.

01:18:19.140 --> 01:18:26.940
Now, So you should understand the time limit.

01:18:31.660 --> 01:18:35.860
You must understand your greatness

01:18:39.020 --> 01:18:44.060
and you must understand how you people

01:18:44.260 --> 01:18:52.700
are chosen for the highest work in this creation.

01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:05.780
So now there's no time for lethargy.

01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:13.740
Now you have to rise and awake.

01:19:19.620 --> 01:19:23.180
Today is the day when I hope

01:19:23.380 --> 01:19:27.615
you have to jump into Nirvikalpa.

01:19:37.885 --> 01:19:40.051
But only by effort you will stay there,

01:19:40.085 --> 01:19:43.645
otherwise you'll again slip down.

01:19:53.085 --> 01:19:55.605
So go through this lecture again and again,

01:19:55.805 --> 01:19:58.485
and do not think about it.

01:20:09.925 --> 01:20:15.565
Don't think that it is for somebody else, it is for you.

01:20:17.325 --> 01:20:19.485
For all of you,

01:20:19.685 --> 01:20:22.085
each of you,

01:20:22.525 --> 01:20:25.245
and you must know yourself

01:20:25.445 --> 01:20:29.805
how far you are going every day.

01:20:39.525 --> 01:20:44.485
Today is a special day of Sahasrara.

01:20:46.845 --> 01:20:51.525
Actually, if you see, it is according

01:20:51.725 --> 01:20:55.485
to the sun calendar,

01:20:55.685 --> 01:20:59.885
Sahasrara would have been tomorrow.

01:21:04.605 --> 01:21:08.845
It's a Monday, which is the Sahasrara

01:21:10.485 --> 01:21:17.325
and just imagine that we are having it one day earlier.

01:21:20.885 --> 01:21:27.645
So one has to know that the calendar of God

01:21:27.845 --> 01:21:32.138
has nothing to do with the human calendar.

01:21:41.185 --> 01:21:43.385
and some think I should have come

01:21:43.585 --> 01:21:47.705
at least two thousand years back,

01:21:51.665 --> 01:21:54.345
in this form.

01:21:55.065 --> 01:22:01.345
So the calendar is all right, timing is all right,

01:22:01.545 --> 01:22:05.225
everything is all right.

01:22:10.105 --> 01:22:15.385
You are not robots, you are not machines,

01:22:17.385 --> 01:22:24.105
you are evolved through evolutionary process.

01:22:26.225 --> 01:22:30.305
And through evolutionary process only

01:22:30.505 --> 01:22:34.905
you have to achieve the higher personality.

01:22:43.025 --> 01:22:48.505
So whatever we may do or whatever may be all right,

01:22:48.705 --> 01:22:54.625
it's you who have to show the results.

01:23:06.425 --> 01:23:14.185
We may take your Sahasrara

01:23:14.385 --> 01:23:20.065
to a great enlightenment but again it will collapse.

01:23:29.025 --> 01:23:36.065
So you have to know that whatever heights

01:23:36.265 --> 01:23:41.265
you are brought to, it is you who have to maintain it

01:23:41.465 --> 01:23:45.625
with full will power and action.

01:24:03.625 --> 01:24:07.625
May God bless you!

01:24:09.185 --> 01:24:13.505
This lecture is a concern of your Mother.

01:24:13.705 --> 01:24:19.025
Do not take it as anything ill.

01:24:32.425 --> 01:24:35.305
I could not have said this even two years back

01:24:35.505 --> 01:24:39.425
or one year back, because you are at the stage

01:24:39.625 --> 01:24:43.105
where I can say these things to you.

01:24:50.305 --> 01:24:53.225
You can understand it, but

01:24:53.425 --> 01:24:56.585
it has to become your consciousness.

01:25:04.705 --> 01:25:08.465
The stage has reached to understand,

01:25:08.665 --> 01:25:11.745
but it should become your consciousness.

01:25:11.945 --> 01:25:16.865
By today's happening should become, if you keep it there.

01:25:26.665 --> 01:25:30.545
So, again, may God bless you!
