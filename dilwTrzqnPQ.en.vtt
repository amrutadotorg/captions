01:41.641 --> 01:44.742
It’s cool, not hot at all.

01:44.943 --> 01:47.640
You’ve got the sari with you?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

01:47.841 --> 01:50.585
Shri Mataji: One sari.
Yogi: … whichever one You would like.

01:50.786 --> 01:55.840
Shri Mataji: One. And another one
belongs to Magdu.

01:56.041 --> 01:58.546
Ask Magdu about the other sari.

01:58.747 --> 02:01.809
Check if he has a sari or not, otherwise
we’ll take their one.

02:02.010 --> 02:04.473
You might be having their sari maybe.
Yogi: Yes, we’ve got one extra.

02:04.674 --> 02:07.676
Shri Mataji: Alright…

03:08.411 --> 03:12.644
I’m sorry today for being late, but
actually I was ready and

03:12.845 --> 03:15.559
all this police case, this, that,

03:15.760 --> 03:21.848
I tell you, unnecessary waste of time
and it had to be this time.

03:53.402 --> 03:57.126
In India we believe that,

03:58.733 --> 04:05.245
that God Himself takes incarnations

04:06.223 --> 04:15.204
with His Vishnu principle whenever
there is

04:17.835 --> 04:26.650
the decline of righteousness
and tries to elevate.

04:30.190 --> 04:37.948
Every incarnation has done lot of work –

04:39.370 --> 04:46.807
[Marathi: “Who is speaking? One should
not speak so loudly.”]

04:56.464 --> 05:01.347
- and have done also work within ourselves.

05:01.961 --> 05:09.877
Now this is the knowledge we had in India,
long time back,

05:10.444 --> 05:16.597
but when they talked about incarnations
people started worshipping them

05:16.798 --> 05:27.074
as some statues or some sort of an images
which were sold in the market

05:27.275 --> 05:34.878
and were made by people who had
no right to do that.

05:35.403 --> 05:41.595
But it is described in the Puranas that
we have got

05:41.796 --> 05:52.205
some of the places where many –

05:57.684 --> 06:01.605
[Marathi: “Who is it? Inform the police.

06:06.085 --> 06:12.399
What is going on? What are the drivers
doing?”.]

06:17.273 --> 06:25.993
They have said that in many places in India
and all over the world

06:26.194 --> 06:37.006
the Mother Earth has created beautiful
deities

06:37.207 --> 06:44.725
to tell the - tell the people or
to sort of tally

06:44.926 --> 06:50.480
with whatever described in those
olden books.

06:50.681 --> 06:56.270
And all these are called as 'Swayambhu',
they are created by themselves.

06:58.114 --> 07:02.208
Unless and until you are a realized soul
you cannot make it out

07:02.409 --> 07:06.408
whether these are real or not.

07:06.609 --> 07:17.961
You have to have vibrations to see that
they emit vibrations quite strongly.

07:18.162 --> 07:23.183
A stone starts emitting vibration, but it
has a form, it has a coefficience,

07:23.384 --> 07:26.364
so how this has been created?

07:27.324 --> 07:33.402
There have been quite lot of miracles
in this country

07:33.926 --> 07:44.672
of these incarnations like Ramadasa who
was the guru of Shivaji Maharaj.

07:44.873 --> 07:51.875
It is said that he, in his own time

07:52.076 --> 08:01.908
the Mother Earth emitted out manifesting
they say five hundred Hanumana.

08:02.109 --> 08:05.912
I don’t know the number is correct or not,
whatever it is.

08:06.113 --> 08:13.676
But the one – they found a statue
in the waters of Angapur.

08:13.877 --> 08:18.243
It was Ramadasa who found it and was
kept there

08:18.444 --> 08:23.636
and there was a statue of another goddess,
Anglaidevi –

08:24.376 --> 08:27.108
must be meaning England I think

08:27.309 --> 08:31.883
goddess coming from England must be
Anglaidevi. Whatever it is.

08:32.084 --> 08:40.245
So they wanted to remove those statues
from there

08:40.662 --> 08:44.662
and they said that the statues would
not move,

08:44.862 --> 08:49.804
so they had to ask for forgiveness and
with great difficulty they could remove

08:50.005 --> 08:53.193
those statues to one place called Chaphal,
where they are kept.

08:53.394 --> 08:57.921
Now why they took it to Chaphal, because
there was one Hanumana created

08:58.122 --> 09:02.393
and this Hanumana, they wanted to change
the face, the architects,

09:02.594 --> 09:06.802
so they went on deep down trying
to find out what is the –

09:07.003 --> 09:11.410
how far does this stone go. So it went on
and on and on and on

09:11.611 --> 09:15.790
for, I don’t know, thousands of feet
they went down

09:15.991 --> 09:20.270
and they saw it was still standing on
one rock straight forward,

09:20.471 --> 09:23.457
so they gave up and they kept as it is.

09:23.658 --> 09:29.012
All such miracles have been here to show
that these are swayambhus.

09:29.213 --> 09:33.338
But then people started making statues
and started worshipping,

09:33.515 --> 09:36.251
then making more statues and worshipping.

09:36.452 --> 09:43.782
As a result, there were incarnations,
other incarnations,

09:43.983 --> 09:48.724
as we think that Dattatreya, the primordial
master,

09:48.925 --> 09:52.428
took incarnations on this Earth and most
of them,

09:52.629 --> 09:59.849
then tried later on to say that we should
not talk of the flower

10:00.050 --> 10:06.493
but we should talk about the honey and
we have to get to the honey.

10:06.694 --> 10:11.539
So they started talking about the Ruh,
about the all-pervading power,

10:11.740 --> 10:17.431
about Brahmachaitanya, all of them
practically talked like that.

10:17.643 --> 10:20.853
Not in the beginning I would say, but later
on when they found that the people

10:21.054 --> 10:25.289
were just busy worshipping any stone,
get from there, put some –

10:25.490 --> 10:29.644
I mean they became just stone worshippers.

10:29.845 --> 10:34.491
So another kind of religion just came in,
which just said that we should believe

10:34.692 --> 10:42.189
in God Almighty and we should just worship
Him as an abstract god.

10:44.758 --> 10:53.372
So, this abstraction also turned out to be
futile because when you talk about flower

10:53.573 --> 10:58.156
you worship the flower and when you talk
about the abstract, you just talk.

10:58.357 --> 11:02.673
It’s a talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
You cannot get to the honey.

11:02.874 --> 11:06.218
So even if you talk of the honey what’s
the use of talking about it?

11:06.419 --> 11:11.859
You have to have it. For that, we have
to become the bee

11:12.060 --> 11:16.429
and that is why it is important that you
have to have your Self Realization.

11:16.630 --> 11:22.287
And in every religion whatsoever, even in
Islam it is said you have to become a wali.

11:22.488 --> 11:26.010
In Christianity it is said you have to be
born again.

11:26.211 --> 11:31.001
In Buddhism it is said you have to become
Buddha, means you should be knowledgeable.

11:31.202 --> 11:35.746
In Mahavira’s things He has said you must
get your Self Realization.

11:35.974 --> 11:38.923
Lao Tse has said it.

11:40.339 --> 11:44.063
Just you should start from Socrates onward.

11:44.279 --> 11:46.783
Of course, we should forget about Plato
and these people

11:46.984 --> 11:51.477
because I don’t think they had much
sense of spirituality.

11:51.678 --> 11:57.172
But most of these people have talked
about Self Realization.

11:57.563 --> 12:01.750
And there’s no religion in which they have
not talked about Self Realization.

12:01.951 --> 12:08.122
Even in the Judaism or where they believe

12:08.323 --> 12:17.271
in the coming of the Saviour
for their salvation,

12:17.472 --> 12:19.439
even they have talked about it.

12:19.640 --> 12:26.448
So it is all described in Koran. There’s
a complete sura describing

12:26.649 --> 12:32.869
about the sent one, means the Avatara,
means the incarnation.

12:33.499 --> 12:36.280
And also said that “you won’t believe,
you won’t accept”

12:36.481 --> 12:40.789
and all those things. So now, once
you are realized souls,

12:40.990 --> 12:45.619
then only you start seeing that all
this talk is futile.

12:45.820 --> 12:50.327
You have to become a realized person.
If you get your realization,

12:50.528 --> 12:55.498
then only you can get over the superficial
illusions

12:55.731 --> 12:59.311
and you can go deep into it.

13:01.695 --> 13:07.710
All these illusions are there in all
the countries,

13:07.911 --> 13:12.105
in all the religions and that’s why
there is a problem

13:12.306 --> 13:20.109
and we have seen people suffering
from the pangs of fundamentalism.

13:20.310 --> 13:24.476
As I have given another lecture
about para-modernism,

13:24.677 --> 13:29.122
in that I have talked about Russia,
that Russia has now withdrawn.

13:29.323 --> 13:35.644
On one side has withdrawn, the rest of the
people, now whom are they going to fight?

13:35.845 --> 13:39.647
If there’s another side is not going
to fight, this side is left out

13:39.848 --> 13:43.741
and they don’t know what to do with
their armaments and everything.

13:43.942 --> 13:47.502
So this was the great work of Gorbachev,
I think,

13:47.703 --> 13:49.925
and he’s a realized soul, so he could
see the point,

13:50.126 --> 13:53.789
and the way he has managed is tremendous.

13:54.403 --> 13:59.497
And now the main problem is fundamentalism
and that comes out of ignorance –

13:59.698 --> 14:04.694
ignorance and also selfishness because
people want to say that

14:04.895 --> 14:09.110
“This is my religion, this is my prophet,
this is my guru,

14:09.311 --> 14:14.770
this is my reli… master” and all
those things.

14:14.971 --> 14:18.574
But actually they don’t belong to any
party, to anyone -

14:18.759 --> 14:21.823
they belong to the whole world.
One can understand

14:22.024 --> 14:26.307
if you establish something for your
protection from other parties,

14:26.508 --> 14:33.965
but to start yourself in a way to establish
a falsehood

14:34.166 --> 14:38.996
surprisingly – very surprising, I don’t
understand human beings.

14:39.197 --> 14:42.100
For such falsehood, they are very
happy to join

14:42.301 --> 14:46.222
and so many will join. Without even
thinking, knowing,

14:46.423 --> 14:49.318
they’ll all club together for a nonsense
like that.

14:49.519 --> 14:52.450
For a nonsense human beings always
club together,

14:52.651 --> 14:56.659
but for a sensible thing they don’t want
to understand.

14:56.860 --> 15:00.849
So now we are coming to the point of puja

15:01.050 --> 15:06.483
because there are so many new Sahaja Yogis
who might not have known what is a puja is.

15:06.684 --> 15:14.714
Now, as it is now, you all believe that
I’m Adi Shakti and you have proof of it.

15:14.915 --> 15:19.390
Puja is one of the way you can have
the proof of it much more.

15:19.591 --> 15:25.709
Because when you are doing the puja
My deities, which are within My chakras,

15:25.910 --> 15:31.450
they get excited and they feel happy
and they want to emit more vibrations.

15:31.651 --> 15:35.500
I mean they start emitting more vibrations…

15:38.371 --> 15:40.988
(“Left Swadhistana”) -

15:43.467 --> 15:49.070
when they start emitting more vibrations,
then you are surprised

15:49.271 --> 15:52.053
that how after puja you get so drenched

15:52.254 --> 15:55.757
and you just feel elevated and
at a much higher level.

15:55.958 --> 16:01.293
Of course, it is true that during the puja
time you feel very much elevated.

16:01.494 --> 16:05.523
For some time you can keep it up. Some
people definitely retain it,

16:05.724 --> 16:08.591
but some people go up and down
like a yo-yo.

16:08.792 --> 16:12.180
They don’t have that capacity to retain it.

16:12.381 --> 16:15.949
That is why one has to meditate
in thoughtless awareness

16:16.150 --> 16:21.405
to keep up that status, that higher status.

16:21.606 --> 16:31.383
But the puja of, only of the Goddess is
allowed, puja of the God is allowed,

16:31.584 --> 16:35.814
but we must know who is the God
or who is the Goddess.

16:36.015 --> 16:39.471
So doing the puja of every person blindly,
anybody

16:39.672 --> 16:42.636
who comes forward, says this and that,
should not be accepted.

16:42.837 --> 16:45.733
You’ll be surprised for the first
four years

16:45.941 --> 16:49.527
I didn’t even allow them to have
any puja whatsoever.

16:49.728 --> 16:52.005
Even they said, “You are our guru,
so you should allow us to have

16:52.206 --> 16:55.835
guru puja.” I said, “Nothing doing.
I will not.”

16:56.036 --> 17:01.217
Then first, after four years,
on the Navaratri day

17:01.433 --> 17:03.975
they wanted to have one puja.
I said, “All right.

17:04.176 --> 17:09.251
You can have it, but very few people.”
And then they found that that puja

17:09.452 --> 17:16.122
gave them so much of vibrations,
so much of elated spirituality

17:16.323 --> 17:19.960
and they touched so many dimensions
suddenly

17:20.161 --> 17:25.130
that then they started requesting Me,
“Mother, you must give me a puja.”

17:25.331 --> 17:29.843
Even in India where we have this system
of puja, people have no idea

17:30.044 --> 17:32.580
how to really do it. It was very
embarrassing,

17:32.781 --> 17:36.032
but I had to tell them each and everything,
“Do like this, do like that,

17:36.233 --> 17:39.276
you must have like this”, it would work
it out this way.

17:39.477 --> 17:42.119
First time I went to Delhi, you’ll be
surprised.

17:42.320 --> 17:46.614
It was... If somebody can get hold of that
photograph I was just shrunk.

17:46.815 --> 17:50.716
I was just shrunk. The whole body
had shrunk. I’d become so thin

17:50.917 --> 17:54.877
and I was so shocked because they were
using all plastics

17:55.078 --> 17:58.322
and things [from/for] used in the thing,
all kinds of things (were there?).

17:58.523 --> 18:00.799
“Oh God,” I said, “Now what to do?”

18:01.000 --> 18:05.904
So I never used to also allow them to give
Me any money or anything before;

18:06.105 --> 18:09.578
then I said, “All right, start with one p”.
They started with one p.

18:09.779 --> 18:13.290
Gradually, they increased; because
I thought that

18:13.491 --> 18:17.793
“They don’t know that you have to use
silver.” And then, out of that money,

18:17.994 --> 18:20.541
I said, “All right, I’ll buy silver.
I’ll put my name on that,

18:20.742 --> 18:24.415
so it’s My property, so whatever you have
given Me is mine,

18:24.616 --> 18:27.235
so-called, and is with you.”

18:27.436 --> 18:35.000
That is how we started this proper
understanding of the thing,

18:35.201 --> 18:41.008
that we have to have a particular type
of metal, particular type of styles.

18:41.209 --> 18:44.736
Now these metals have an effect on us,
very much effect on us

18:44.916 --> 18:48.408
and in what metal you do the puja
also has an effect.

18:48.609 --> 18:53.714
It’s all a science of spirituality, which
one must understand is very important

18:53.887 --> 18:57.947
and should be done in a proper way
if you have to have the best results.

18:58.148 --> 19:02.332
It’s like a science. And so the pujas
started

19:02.533 --> 19:08.674
and I think now people have got quite
a good sense of it.

19:08.875 --> 19:13.462
Now, it is – in Maharashtra specially
they are experts

19:13.663 --> 19:16.151
and it’s very difficult to argue with them,

19:16.352 --> 19:20.427
so they said that “Mother, You are supposed
to - we are supposed to give You a sari.”

19:20.628 --> 19:23.659
But they’re such experts, they said,
“No, we have to give You a sari.”

19:23.860 --> 19:27.486
Then I said, “All right, give Me ordinary
sari, I will not take expensive.”

19:27.687 --> 19:33.720
Then they argued with Me, this thing,
that thing. It went on, on and on and on.

19:34.188 --> 19:38.710
And then it started onto, they said,
“We cannot give you falsery.”

19:38.911 --> 19:43.387
I said, “All right, give Me anything.”
Then it has become so expensive now.

19:43.588 --> 19:46.744
See, so I’ve been requesting that now,
for future,

19:46.945 --> 19:49.691
try to understand that now I’m old

19:49.892 --> 19:55.513
and to an old Goddess you can give
something simple. There’s…

19:58.229 --> 20:01.723
But nobody is willing to accept. “Now we
are growing so much, this, that”.

20:01.924 --> 20:05.727
All right, let us see how we reconcile
each other.

20:05.928 --> 20:11.875
So this is how it is, that it makes no
difference, but it does in a way

20:12.076 --> 20:17.169
what importance you give to everything
that you want to do.

20:17.370 --> 20:23.279
It’s very important, is the complete
attention, dedication

20:23.480 --> 20:27.410
and the complete importance that you give
to anything that you do;

20:27.611 --> 20:34.261
is very important. If you do not give it
the highest priority, it doesn’t work.

20:34.525 --> 20:38.201
If it is just by the way it doesn’t work.

20:38.402 --> 20:42.315
So it is important to understand that if
you have to gain anything

20:42.516 --> 20:46.256
in this puja you have to give it
the highest priority.

20:46.457 --> 20:49.935
And then just before puja, if your mind
is telling you or doubting,

20:50.136 --> 20:54.528
just tell him to stop because that mind
can act against you.

20:54.729 --> 21:02.383
So for the puja, you should be all prepared
in a way, in a receptive way and receive it.

21:02.584 --> 21:07.746
You all understand quite a bit English. Whatever
I have said now, you already know that,

21:07.947 --> 21:17.630
whenever you perform a puja, it pleases very
much the deities who are residing in Me.

21:17.831 --> 21:20.516
And they start emitting vibrations
with full force,

21:20.717 --> 21:22.200
sometimes more than necessary -

21:22.401 --> 21:24.963
whether you absorb or even when you are
not able to absorb those vibrations.

21:25.164 --> 21:28.531
When you all are not able to absorb
the vibrations it causes lot of pain to Me.

21:28.732 --> 21:34.800
That is why you all should sit in puja
with an open mind and heart.

21:35.001 --> 21:43.151
The more conviction you have, the more
you will able take advantage from it.

21:43.352 --> 21:46.853
You should have pure desire. You have to
sit with pure desire and you have to ask:

21:47.054 --> 21:53.643
“Mother, please colour my inner self
in such manner

21:55.127 --> 21:58.052
that those colour can never fade away.

21:58.253 --> 22:02.623
Colour me in a manner that it never goes
away. Fill me up with such colour.”

22:02.824 --> 22:07.269
Desire in your heart in this manner
before sitting (for puja).

22:07.470 --> 22:13.145
Now it’s quite late. Unnecessarily they
have appointed policemen.

22:13.346 --> 22:16.418
I had to spend time also entertaining them.

22:16.619 --> 22:19.073
And then this has happened, at the moment
there is a nice cool breeze,

22:19.274 --> 22:22.163
so it’s better the puja has started now.

22:26.409 --> 22:29.799
Now we are going to start the puja.

22:30.711 --> 22:39.204
As I have already told you, sit in puja
tranquilly, with an open mind.

22:39.405 --> 22:45.743
We are not able to call any children today
for washing My feet as they are too many.

22:45.944 --> 22:57.519
Someone will wash My feet while you may
sing a bhajan of Ganesha.

22:57.720 --> 23:00.496
You can sing the song of Ganesha Atharva
Sheersha.

23:06.564 --> 23:11.995
Everybody must know it by heart; alright,
in any case you can sing it.
