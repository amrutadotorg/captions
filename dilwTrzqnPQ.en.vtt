00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:44.742
It’s cool, not hot at all.

00:01:44.943 --> 00:01:47.640
You’ve got the sari with you?
Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:50.585
Shri Mataji: One sari.
Yogi: … whichever one You would like.

00:01:50.786 --> 00:01:55.840
Shri Mataji: One. And another one
belongs to Magdu.

00:01:56.041 --> 00:01:58.546
Ask Magdu about the other sari.

00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:01.809
Check if he has a sari or not, otherwise
we’ll take their one.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.473
You might be having their sari maybe.
Yogi: Yes, we’ve got one extra.

00:02:04.674 --> 00:02:07.676
Shri Mataji: Alright…

00:03:08.411 --> 00:03:12.644
I’m sorry today for being late, but
actually I was ready and

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:15.559
all this police case, this, that,

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.848
I tell you, unnecessary waste of time
and it had to be this time.

00:03:53.402 --> 00:03:57.126
In India we believe that,

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:05.245
that God Himself takes incarnations

00:04:06.223 --> 00:04:15.204
with His Vishnu principle whenever
there is

00:04:17.835 --> 00:04:26.650
the decline of righteousness
and tries to elevate.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:37.948
Every incarnation has done lot of work –

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:46.807
[Marathi: “Who is speaking? One should
not speak so loudly.”]

00:04:56.464 --> 00:05:01.347
- and have done also work within ourselves.

00:05:01.961 --> 00:05:09.877
Now this is the knowledge we had in India,
long time back,

00:05:10.444 --> 00:05:16.597
but when they talked about incarnations
people started worshipping them

00:05:16.798 --> 00:05:27.074
as some statues or some sort of an images
which were sold in the market

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:34.878
and were made by people who had
no right to do that.

00:05:35.403 --> 00:05:41.595
But it is described in the Puranas that
we have got

00:05:41.796 --> 00:05:52.205
some of the places where many –

00:05:57.684 --> 00:06:01.605
[Marathi: “Who is it? Inform the police.

00:06:06.085 --> 00:06:12.399
What is going on? What are the drivers
doing?”.]

00:06:17.273 --> 00:06:25.993
They have said that in many places in India
and all over the world

00:06:26.194 --> 00:06:37.006
the Mother Earth has created beautiful
deities

00:06:37.207 --> 00:06:44.725
to tell the - tell the people or
to sort of tally

00:06:44.926 --> 00:06:50.480
with whatever described in those
olden books.

00:06:50.681 --> 00:06:56.270
And all these are called as 'Swayambhu',
they are created by themselves.

00:06:58.114 --> 00:07:02.208
Unless and until you are a realized soul
you cannot make it out

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:06.408
whether these are real or not.

00:07:06.609 --> 00:07:17.961
You have to have vibrations to see that
they emit vibrations quite strongly.

00:07:18.162 --> 00:07:23.183
A stone starts emitting vibration, but it
has a form, it has a coefficience,

00:07:23.384 --> 00:07:26.364
so how this has been created?

00:07:27.324 --> 00:07:33.402
There have been quite lot of miracles
in this country

00:07:33.926 --> 00:07:44.672
of these incarnations like Ramadasa who
was the guru of Shivaji Maharaj.

00:07:44.873 --> 00:07:51.875
It is said that he, in his own time

00:07:52.076 --> 00:08:01.908
the Mother Earth emitted out manifesting
they say five hundred Hanumana.

00:08:02.109 --> 00:08:05.912
I don’t know the number is correct or not,
whatever it is.

00:08:06.113 --> 00:08:13.676
But the one – they found a statue
in the waters of Angapur.

00:08:13.877 --> 00:08:18.243
It was Ramadasa who found it and was
kept there

00:08:18.444 --> 00:08:23.636
and there was a statue of another goddess,
Anglaidevi –

00:08:24.376 --> 00:08:27.108
must be meaning England I think

00:08:27.309 --> 00:08:31.883
goddess coming from England must be
Anglaidevi. Whatever it is.

00:08:32.084 --> 00:08:40.245
So they wanted to remove those statues
from there

00:08:40.662 --> 00:08:44.662
and they said that the statues would
not move,

00:08:44.862 --> 00:08:49.804
so they had to ask for forgiveness and
with great difficulty they could remove

00:08:50.005 --> 00:08:53.193
those statues to one place called Chaphal,
where they are kept.

00:08:53.394 --> 00:08:57.921
Now why they took it to Chaphal, because
there was one Hanumana created

00:08:58.122 --> 00:09:02.393
and this Hanumana, they wanted to change
the face, the architects,

00:09:02.594 --> 00:09:06.802
so they went on deep down trying
to find out what is the –

00:09:07.003 --> 00:09:11.410
how far does this stone go. So it went on
and on and on and on

00:09:11.611 --> 00:09:15.790
for, I don’t know, thousands of feet
they went down

00:09:15.991 --> 00:09:20.270
and they saw it was still standing on
one rock straight forward,

00:09:20.471 --> 00:09:23.457
so they gave up and they kept as it is.

00:09:23.658 --> 00:09:29.012
All such miracles have been here to show
that these are swayambhus.

00:09:29.213 --> 00:09:33.338
But then people started making statues
and started worshipping,

00:09:33.515 --> 00:09:36.251
then making more statues and worshipping.

00:09:36.452 --> 00:09:43.782
As a result, there were incarnations,
other incarnations,

00:09:43.983 --> 00:09:48.724
as we think that Dattatreya, the primordial
master,

00:09:48.925 --> 00:09:52.428
took incarnations on this Earth and most
of them,

00:09:52.629 --> 00:09:59.849
then tried later on to say that we should
not talk of the flower

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:06.493
but we should talk about the honey and
we have to get to the honey.

00:10:06.694 --> 00:10:11.539
So they started talking about the Ruh,
about the all-pervading power,

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:17.431
about Brahmachaitanya, all of them
practically talked like that.

00:10:17.643 --> 00:10:20.853
Not in the beginning I would say, but later
on when they found that the people

00:10:21.054 --> 00:10:25.289
were just busy worshipping any stone,
get from there, put some –

00:10:25.490 --> 00:10:29.644
I mean they became just stone worshippers.

00:10:29.845 --> 00:10:34.491
So another kind of religion just came in,
which just said that we should believe

00:10:34.692 --> 00:10:42.189
in God Almighty and we should just worship
Him as an abstract god.

00:10:44.758 --> 00:10:53.372
So, this abstraction also turned out to be
futile because when you talk about flower

00:10:53.573 --> 00:10:58.156
you worship the flower and when you talk
about the abstract, you just talk.

00:10:58.357 --> 00:11:02.673
It’s a talk, talk, talk, talk, talk.
You cannot get to the honey.

00:11:02.874 --> 00:11:06.218
So even if you talk of the honey what’s
the use of talking about it?

00:11:06.419 --> 00:11:11.859
You have to have it. For that, we have
to become the bee

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:16.429
and that is why it is important that you
have to have your Self Realization.

00:11:16.630 --> 00:11:22.287
And in every religion whatsoever, even in
Islam it is said you have to become a wali.

00:11:22.488 --> 00:11:26.010
In Christianity it is said you have to be
born again.

00:11:26.211 --> 00:11:31.001
In Buddhism it is said you have to become
Buddha, means you should be knowledgeable.

00:11:31.202 --> 00:11:35.746
In Mahavira’s things He has said you must
get your Self Realization.

00:11:35.974 --> 00:11:38.923
Lao Tse has said it.

00:11:40.339 --> 00:11:44.063
Just you should start from Socrates onward.

00:11:44.279 --> 00:11:46.783
Of course, we should forget about Plato
and these people

00:11:46.984 --> 00:11:51.477
because I don’t think they had much
sense of spirituality.

00:11:51.678 --> 00:11:57.172
But most of these people have talked
about Self Realization.

00:11:57.563 --> 00:12:01.750
And there’s no religion in which they have
not talked about Self Realization.

00:12:01.951 --> 00:12:08.122
Even in the Judaism or where they believe

00:12:08.323 --> 00:12:17.271
in the coming of the Saviour
for their salvation,

00:12:17.472 --> 00:12:19.439
even they have talked about it.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:26.448
So it is all described in Koran. There’s
a complete sura describing

00:12:26.649 --> 00:12:32.869
about the sent one, means the Avatara,
means the incarnation.

00:12:33.499 --> 00:12:36.280
And also said that “you won’t believe,
you won’t accept”

00:12:36.481 --> 00:12:40.789
and all those things. So now, once
you are realized souls,

00:12:40.990 --> 00:12:45.619
then only you start seeing that all
this talk is futile.

00:12:45.820 --> 00:12:50.327
You have to become a realized person.
If you get your realization,

00:12:50.528 --> 00:12:55.498
then only you can get over the superficial
illusions

00:12:55.731 --> 00:12:59.311
and you can go deep into it.

00:13:01.695 --> 00:13:07.710
All these illusions are there in all
the countries,

00:13:07.911 --> 00:13:12.105
in all the religions and that’s why
there is a problem

00:13:12.306 --> 00:13:20.109
and we have seen people suffering
from the pangs of fundamentalism.

00:13:20.310 --> 00:13:24.476
As I have given another lecture
about para-modernism,

00:13:24.677 --> 00:13:29.122
in that I have talked about Russia,
that Russia has now withdrawn.

00:13:29.323 --> 00:13:35.644
On one side has withdrawn, the rest of the
people, now whom are they going to fight?

00:13:35.845 --> 00:13:39.647
If there’s another side is not going
to fight, this side is left out

00:13:39.848 --> 00:13:43.741
and they don’t know what to do with
their armaments and everything.

00:13:43.942 --> 00:13:47.502
So this was the great work of Gorbachev,
I think,

00:13:47.703 --> 00:13:49.925
and he’s a realized soul, so he could
see the point,

00:13:50.126 --> 00:13:53.789
and the way he has managed is tremendous.

00:13:54.403 --> 00:13:59.497
And now the main problem is fundamentalism
and that comes out of ignorance –

00:13:59.698 --> 00:14:04.694
ignorance and also selfishness because
people want to say that

00:14:04.895 --> 00:14:09.110
“This is my religion, this is my prophet,
this is my guru,

00:14:09.311 --> 00:14:14.770
this is my reli… master” and all
those things.

00:14:14.971 --> 00:14:18.574
But actually they don’t belong to any
party, to anyone -

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:21.823
they belong to the whole world.
One can understand

00:14:22.024 --> 00:14:26.307
if you establish something for your
protection from other parties,

00:14:26.508 --> 00:14:33.965
but to start yourself in a way to establish
a falsehood

00:14:34.166 --> 00:14:38.996
surprisingly – very surprising, I don’t
understand human beings.

00:14:39.197 --> 00:14:42.100
For such falsehood, they are very
happy to join

00:14:42.301 --> 00:14:46.222
and so many will join. Without even
thinking, knowing,

00:14:46.423 --> 00:14:49.318
they’ll all club together for a nonsense
like that.

00:14:49.519 --> 00:14:52.450
For a nonsense human beings always
club together,

00:14:52.651 --> 00:14:56.659
but for a sensible thing they don’t want
to understand.

00:14:56.860 --> 00:15:00.849
So now we are coming to the point of puja

00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:06.483
because there are so many new Sahaja Yogis
who might not have known what is a puja is.

00:15:06.684 --> 00:15:14.714
Now, as it is now, you all believe that
I’m Adi Shakti and you have proof of it.

00:15:14.915 --> 00:15:19.390
Puja is one of the way you can have
the proof of it much more.

00:15:19.591 --> 00:15:25.709
Because when you are doing the puja
My deities, which are within My chakras,

00:15:25.910 --> 00:15:31.450
they get excited and they feel happy
and they want to emit more vibrations.

00:15:31.651 --> 00:15:35.500
I mean they start emitting more vibrations…

00:15:38.371 --> 00:15:40.988
(“Left Swadhistana”) -

00:15:43.467 --> 00:15:49.070
when they start emitting more vibrations,
then you are surprised

00:15:49.271 --> 00:15:52.053
that how after puja you get so drenched

00:15:52.254 --> 00:15:55.757
and you just feel elevated and
at a much higher level.

00:15:55.958 --> 00:16:01.293
Of course, it is true that during the puja
time you feel very much elevated.

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:05.523
For some time you can keep it up. Some
people definitely retain it,

00:16:05.724 --> 00:16:08.591
but some people go up and down
like a yo-yo.

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:12.180
They don’t have that capacity to retain it.

00:16:12.381 --> 00:16:15.949
That is why one has to meditate
in thoughtless awareness

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:21.405
to keep up that status, that higher status.

00:16:21.606 --> 00:16:31.383
But the puja of, only of the Goddess is
allowed, puja of the God is allowed,

00:16:31.584 --> 00:16:35.814
but we must know who is the God
or who is the Goddess.

00:16:36.015 --> 00:16:39.471
So doing the puja of every person blindly,
anybody

00:16:39.672 --> 00:16:42.636
who comes forward, says this and that,
should not be accepted.

00:16:42.837 --> 00:16:45.733
You’ll be surprised for the first
four years

00:16:45.941 --> 00:16:49.527
I didn’t even allow them to have
any puja whatsoever.

00:16:49.728 --> 00:16:52.005
Even they said, “You are our guru,
so you should allow us to have

00:16:52.206 --> 00:16:55.835
guru puja.” I said, “Nothing doing.
I will not.”

00:16:56.036 --> 00:17:01.217
Then first, after four years,
on the Navaratri day

00:17:01.433 --> 00:17:03.975
they wanted to have one puja.
I said, “All right.

00:17:04.176 --> 00:17:09.251
You can have it, but very few people.”
And then they found that that puja

00:17:09.452 --> 00:17:16.122
gave them so much of vibrations,
so much of elated spirituality

00:17:16.323 --> 00:17:19.960
and they touched so many dimensions
suddenly

00:17:20.161 --> 00:17:25.130
that then they started requesting Me,
“Mother, you must give me a puja.”

00:17:25.331 --> 00:17:29.843
Even in India where we have this system
of puja, people have no idea

00:17:30.044 --> 00:17:32.580
how to really do it. It was very
embarrassing,

00:17:32.781 --> 00:17:36.032
but I had to tell them each and everything,
“Do like this, do like that,

00:17:36.233 --> 00:17:39.276
you must have like this”, it would work
it out this way.

00:17:39.477 --> 00:17:42.119
First time I went to Delhi, you’ll be
surprised.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:46.614
It was... If somebody can get hold of that
photograph I was just shrunk.

00:17:46.815 --> 00:17:50.716
I was just shrunk. The whole body
had shrunk. I’d become so thin

00:17:50.917 --> 00:17:54.877
and I was so shocked because they were
using all plastics

00:17:55.078 --> 00:17:58.322
and things [from/for] used in the thing,
all kinds of things (were there?).

00:17:58.523 --> 00:18:00.799
“Oh God,” I said, “Now what to do?”

00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.904
So I never used to also allow them to give
Me any money or anything before;

00:18:06.105 --> 00:18:09.578
then I said, “All right, start with one p”.
They started with one p.

00:18:09.779 --> 00:18:13.290
Gradually, they increased; because
I thought that

00:18:13.491 --> 00:18:17.793
“They don’t know that you have to use
silver.” And then, out of that money,

00:18:17.994 --> 00:18:20.541
I said, “All right, I’ll buy silver.
I’ll put my name on that,

00:18:20.742 --> 00:18:24.415
so it’s My property, so whatever you have
given Me is mine,

00:18:24.616 --> 00:18:27.235
so-called, and is with you.”

00:18:27.436 --> 00:18:35.000
That is how we started this proper
understanding of the thing,

00:18:35.201 --> 00:18:41.008
that we have to have a particular type
of metal, particular type of styles.

00:18:41.209 --> 00:18:44.736
Now these metals have an effect on us,
very much effect on us

00:18:44.916 --> 00:18:48.408
and in what metal you do the puja
also has an effect.

00:18:48.609 --> 00:18:53.714
It’s all a science of spirituality, which
one must understand is very important

00:18:53.887 --> 00:18:57.947
and should be done in a proper way
if you have to have the best results.

00:18:58.148 --> 00:19:02.332
It’s like a science. And so the pujas
started

00:19:02.533 --> 00:19:08.674
and I think now people have got quite
a good sense of it.

00:19:08.875 --> 00:19:13.462
Now, it is – in Maharashtra specially
they are experts

00:19:13.663 --> 00:19:16.151
and it’s very difficult to argue with them,

00:19:16.352 --> 00:19:20.427
so they said that “Mother, You are supposed
to - we are supposed to give You a sari.”

00:19:20.628 --> 00:19:23.659
But they’re such experts, they said,
“No, we have to give You a sari.”

00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.486
Then I said, “All right, give Me ordinary
sari, I will not take expensive.”

00:19:27.687 --> 00:19:33.720
Then they argued with Me, this thing,
that thing. It went on, on and on and on.

00:19:34.188 --> 00:19:38.710
And then it started onto, they said,
“We cannot give you falsery.”

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:43.387
I said, “All right, give Me anything.”
Then it has become so expensive now.

00:19:43.588 --> 00:19:46.744
See, so I’ve been requesting that now,
for future,

00:19:46.945 --> 00:19:49.691
try to understand that now I’m old

00:19:49.892 --> 00:19:55.513
and to an old Goddess you can give
something simple. There’s…

00:19:58.229 --> 00:20:01.723
But nobody is willing to accept. “Now we
are growing so much, this, that”.

00:20:01.924 --> 00:20:05.727
All right, let us see how we reconcile
each other.

00:20:05.928 --> 00:20:11.875
So this is how it is, that it makes no
difference, but it does in a way

00:20:12.076 --> 00:20:17.169
what importance you give to everything
that you want to do.

00:20:17.370 --> 00:20:23.279
It’s very important, is the complete
attention, dedication

00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:27.410
and the complete importance that you give
to anything that you do;

00:20:27.611 --> 00:20:34.261
is very important. If you do not give it
the highest priority, it doesn’t work.

00:20:34.525 --> 00:20:38.201
If it is just by the way it doesn’t work.

00:20:38.402 --> 00:20:42.315
So it is important to understand that if
you have to gain anything

00:20:42.516 --> 00:20:46.256
in this puja you have to give it
the highest priority.

00:20:46.457 --> 00:20:49.935
And then just before puja, if your mind
is telling you or doubting,

00:20:50.136 --> 00:20:54.528
just tell him to stop because that mind
can act against you.

00:20:54.729 --> 00:21:02.383
So for the puja, you should be all prepared
in a way, in a receptive way and receive it.

00:21:02.584 --> 00:21:07.746
You all understand quite a bit English. Whatever
I have said now, you already know that,

00:21:07.947 --> 00:21:17.630
whenever you perform a puja, it pleases very
much the deities who are residing in Me.

00:21:17.831 --> 00:21:20.516
And they start emitting vibrations
with full force,

00:21:20.717 --> 00:21:22.200
sometimes more than necessary -

00:21:22.401 --> 00:21:24.963
whether you absorb or even when you are
not able to absorb those vibrations.

00:21:25.164 --> 00:21:28.531
When you all are not able to absorb
the vibrations it causes lot of pain to Me.

00:21:28.732 --> 00:21:34.800
That is why you all should sit in puja
with an open mind and heart.

00:21:35.001 --> 00:21:43.151
The more conviction you have, the more
you will able take advantage from it.

00:21:43.352 --> 00:21:46.853
You should have pure desire. You have to
sit with pure desire and you have to ask:

00:21:47.054 --> 00:21:53.643
“Mother, please colour my inner self
in such manner

00:21:55.127 --> 00:21:58.052
that those colour can never fade away.

00:21:58.253 --> 00:22:02.623
Colour me in a manner that it never goes
away. Fill me up with such colour.”

00:22:02.824 --> 00:22:07.269
Desire in your heart in this manner
before sitting (for puja).

00:22:07.470 --> 00:22:13.145
Now it’s quite late. Unnecessarily they
have appointed policemen.

00:22:13.346 --> 00:22:16.418
I had to spend time also entertaining them.

00:22:16.619 --> 00:22:19.073
And then this has happened, at the moment
there is a nice cool breeze,

00:22:19.274 --> 00:22:22.163
so it’s better the puja has started now.

00:22:26.409 --> 00:22:29.799
Now we are going to start the puja.

00:22:30.711 --> 00:22:39.204
As I have already told you, sit in puja
tranquilly, with an open mind.

00:22:39.405 --> 00:22:45.743
We are not able to call any children today
for washing My feet as they are too many.

00:22:45.944 --> 00:22:57.519
Someone will wash My feet while you may
sing a bhajan of Ganesha.

00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:00.496
You can sing the song of Ganesha Atharva
Sheersha.

00:23:06.564 --> 00:23:11.995
Everybody must know it by heart; alright,
in any case you can sing it.
