00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:16.643
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

00:00:17.493 --> 00:00:21.251
Spirit that resides in your heart.

00:00:21.618 --> 00:00:27.745
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:32.402
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

00:00:32.802 --> 00:00:42.837
Spirit is the one which is the diamond which shines

00:00:42.917 --> 00:00:47.890
on this beautiful ring of your body, mind and your emotions.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.977
That’s the most important thing.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.082
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

00:00:59.702 --> 00:01:03.825
That state should be achieved by all of you.

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:08.683
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:16.097
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:21.685
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

00:01:21.765 --> 00:01:25.535
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:30.097
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:33.240
I mean, I have to control myself;

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.914
the love just shoots off from the being

00:01:36.994 --> 00:01:40.369
and just I want to give it

00:01:41.858 --> 00:01:46.027
but I wonder whether you’ll be able to bear it,

00:01:49.022 --> 00:01:51.370
so I have to control it a little bit

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.317
that flood may not be borne.

00:01:54.497 --> 00:01:59.692
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

00:02:00.072 --> 00:02:02.095
And the more you enrich it,

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:07.185
the more you make it strong, the more it will shine.

00:02:07.571 --> 00:02:12.780
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.717
that Spirit is love,

00:02:16.797 --> 00:02:21.452
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

00:02:21.532 --> 00:02:24.766
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:29.529
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:37.141
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

00:02:37.414 --> 00:02:41.348
the inside starts shining by itself.

00:02:42.828 --> 00:02:46.985
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

00:02:47.725 --> 00:02:53.700
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving 
to the Spirit, you can’t imagine.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.195
Try them! You will enjoy yourself.

00:02:58.295 --> 00:03:01.232
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

00:03:01.313 --> 00:03:03.560
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.327
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

00:03:06.407 --> 00:03:09.259
because I can enjoy myself there better!

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:13.245
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself so much

00:03:13.325 --> 00:03:16.602
when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

00:03:16.682 --> 00:03:21.623
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

00:03:22.745 --> 00:03:25.887
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:03:25.967 --> 00:03:30.288
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

00:03:30.368 --> 00:03:34.040
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.377
Sometimes you come down, you start criticizing others.

00:03:39.458 --> 00:03:42.331
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees somebody

00:03:42.411 --> 00:03:44.456
filthy, dirty, something like that.

00:03:44.536 --> 00:03:46.563
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

00:03:46.644 --> 00:03:49.075
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

00:03:49.156 --> 00:03:52.521
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

00:03:52.601 --> 00:03:55.609
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

00:03:56.368 --> 00:03:58.995
But instead of that if you start criticizing that person,

00:03:59.076 --> 00:04:02.582
you also become filthy in your language, 
filthy in your mind and everything,

00:04:02.663 --> 00:04:06.144
so why [do it]? Leave it! Let that person improve by himself,

00:04:06.224 --> 00:04:11.151
to see that he has to be clean, he has 
to be neat, he has to be sensible.

00:04:12.111 --> 00:04:15.768
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

00:04:15.848 --> 00:04:17.934
Where is your attention?

00:04:19.646 --> 00:04:23.483
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will 
ask the children when they are standing,

00:04:23.564 --> 00:04:27.368
“Where is your attention?”  “Where is my attention?” alright.

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.216
Then again he’s standing there, “Where is your attention?”

00:04:30.296 --> 00:04:33.394
Again he’ll be on the watch [out], “Where is my attention gone?”

00:04:33.474 --> 00:04:36.017
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

00:04:36.097 --> 00:04:40.003
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

00:04:43.848 --> 00:04:47.189
I hope this time we are going to achieve a lot because

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:50.142
I have a feeling that this time, in all the pujas,

00:04:50.223 --> 00:04:53.799
I am really working very, very hard — very hard.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:58.016
And if you people little bit, little bit decide

00:04:59.364 --> 00:05:04.642
that we are not here for enjoyment, for 
buying clothes or saris or anything,

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:07.546
but we are here for our ascent.

00:05:08.059 --> 00:05:13.509
If that is decided in your hearts, I’m sure it will work out.

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.432
Please try to control your attention.

00:05:16.565 --> 00:05:19.243
Control it. Chitta niroda. Control it.

00:05:19.323 --> 00:05:23.563
Where is it going? See, “Where is my attention going?

00:05:23.854 --> 00:05:25.843
Ask, “Where is the attention going?”

00:05:25.923 --> 00:05:29.115
Ask yourself, “Am I there or am I out?”

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:34.111
Otherwise you’ll have very funny awareness,

00:05:34.191 --> 00:05:36.183
very funny awareness.

00:05:39.783 --> 00:05:43.790
But the most thing is, that in your heart, in your mind,

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.352
don’t allow funny ideas to come in.

00:05:46.432 --> 00:05:48.435
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

00:05:48.515 --> 00:05:53.259
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is not good, 
that man is not good.’

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:57.338
Just don’t listen to these things, just listen to yourself,

00:05:57.418 --> 00:06:02.472
that ‘Where am I?’ ‘What am I doing?’ 
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

00:06:02.552 --> 00:06:05.926
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’ ‘Am I helping others?’

00:06:06.006 --> 00:06:09.665
‘Where is my attention?’ The attention has to be:

00:06:09.745 --> 00:06:12.724
‘What am I doing with what Mother has given to me?’

00:06:15.678 --> 00:06:18.233
Now at Vishuddhi as you know we are collective

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.677
and we have connections with others.

00:06:20.757 --> 00:06:23.816
So He said all this is a ‘leela’ [play]

00:06:23.896 --> 00:06:30.743
and in a very playful, mirthful way you should be with others

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:35.702
and great friendly with others and create relationships.

00:06:35.782 --> 00:06:39.099
So this is the Vishuddhi chakra.

00:06:39.179 --> 00:06:45.733
But the other point I tried to say that the relation with others,

00:06:45.813 --> 00:06:50.050
anything if it does not have depth, it is superficial,

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:54.959
if it is for ego or for some conditioning 
or some calculations of the mind.

00:06:55.039 --> 00:06:59.696
If at a mental level if you are friendly with anyone

00:06:59.776 --> 00:07:03.168
or for emotional level if you are friendly with anyone,

00:07:03.248 --> 00:07:05.487
without any depth in yourself,

00:07:05.567 --> 00:07:11.275
it can be very temporary and will have no effect whatsoever.

00:07:11.356 --> 00:07:14.296
So you have to have depth and to get to the depth,

00:07:14.376 --> 00:07:17.175
you must look after your Agnya chakra.

00:07:17.255 --> 00:07:20.770
And the Agnya chakra is nothing but your attention.

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:29.300
If your attention is all the time roaming 
about paying attention to 1001 thing,

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:33.920
then you cannot develop that concentrated penetration

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:40.500
of your attention into things and whatever you do is very superficial.

00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:42.435
It’s not joy giving.

00:07:42.515 --> 00:07:48.965
So the combination should be that you should look after your Vishuddhi

00:07:49.045 --> 00:07:53.452
– of today for example you can have a very 
playful, mirthful time together.

00:07:53.532 --> 00:07:55.691
Enjoy with each other;

00:07:55.945 --> 00:08:01.437
but you have to know that it has to come from your heart

00:08:01.517 --> 00:08:04.202
or from your Spirit.

00:08:04.282 --> 00:08:06.155
So how to touch that?

00:08:06.235 --> 00:08:10.975
That depth can only be possible if your attention is on the Spirit

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:13.662
and not on frivolous things.

00:08:14.254 --> 00:08:18.560
Because of that you’ll become thoughtlessly 
aware when you’ll be enjoying.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.373
And that whatever you’ll do it will be very genuine,

00:08:23.453 --> 00:08:27.843
it will not have artificiality.

00:08:27.923 --> 00:08:31.911
That is why the second part is after ‘leela’;

00:08:31.997 --> 00:08:34.246
what you call is the ‘jana’ part

00:08:34.326 --> 00:08:37.573
where it is the collectivity.

00:08:37.916 --> 00:08:43.333
Higher chakra is Agnya where it is ‘tapah’ – means penance.

00:08:43.453 --> 00:08:45.059
You have to go through the penance.

00:08:45.139 --> 00:08:48.101
And now in Sahaja Yoga penance is not food,

00:08:48.181 --> 00:08:50.775
is not other useless things

00:08:50.855 --> 00:08:54.477
but what is the most important is to control your attention.

00:08:54.557 --> 00:08:56.216
Where does it go?

00:08:56.296 --> 00:08:58.933
Does it go to your worries, to your troubles,

00:08:59.014 --> 00:09:01.697
to your past, to this, to others?

00:09:01.777 --> 00:09:05.263
Or does it go to your Spirit?

00:09:06.123 --> 00:09:10.530
This is important to see that your attention is on your Spirit.

00:09:11.689 --> 00:09:15.449
If your attention is on you Spirit, then you get that depth,

00:09:15.575 --> 00:09:18.647
that genuiness in your relationship with others.
