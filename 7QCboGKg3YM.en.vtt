00:11.723 --> 00:16.643
And, last of all, the most important, is your Spirit,

00:17.493 --> 00:21.251
Spirit that resides in your heart.

00:21.618 --> 00:27.745
All this beauty is only perceived when there is light in your Spirit

00:27.825 --> 00:32.402
otherwise you cannot see all this beauty, you cannot enjoy it.

00:32.802 --> 00:42.837
Spirit is the one which is the diamond which shines

00:42.917 --> 00:47.890
on this beautiful ring of your body, mind and your emotions.

00:48.560 --> 00:50.977
That’s the most important thing.

00:51.120 --> 00:59.082
That is to be achieved, to be absolutely absorbed into your being.

00:59.702 --> 01:03.825
That state should be achieved by all of you.

01:03.905 --> 01:08.683
But the growth, if the outside is not alright,

01:08.763 --> 01:16.097
then the inside cannot be carried by that weak outside.

01:16.939 --> 01:21.685
It’s such a strong thing spiritual life is a very strong thing;

01:21.765 --> 01:25.535
it’s so dynamic, it’s so powerful.

01:26.202 --> 01:30.097
Sometimes, you know, it floods me completely.

01:30.345 --> 01:33.240
I mean, I have to control myself;

01:33.320 --> 01:36.914
the love just shoots off from the being

01:36.994 --> 01:40.369
and just I want to give it

01:41.858 --> 01:46.027
but I wonder whether you’ll be able to bear it,

01:49.022 --> 01:51.370
so I have to control it a little bit

01:51.450 --> 01:54.317
that flood may not be borne.

01:54.497 --> 01:59.692
So you have to enrich your outside to bear that inside beauty.

02:00.072 --> 02:02.095
And the more you enrich it,

02:02.175 --> 02:07.185
the more you make it strong, the more it will shine.

02:07.571 --> 02:12.780
It’s so simultaneous because one must understand

02:12.860 --> 02:16.717
that Spirit is love,

02:16.797 --> 02:21.452
is all intelligence, is all awareness,

02:21.532 --> 02:24.766
and it knows your problem. It slowly shines.

02:24.846 --> 02:29.529
It sees how far you can bear, how far you can go.

02:30.209 --> 02:37.141
Then after realisation, when you start looking after your outside,

02:37.414 --> 02:41.348
the inside starts shining by itself.

02:42.828 --> 02:46.985
But attention should be towards your Spirit.

02:47.725 --> 02:53.700
All these outside qualities are so joy-giving
to the Spirit, you can’t imagine.

02:53.780 --> 02:58.195
Try them! You will enjoy yourself.

02:58.295 --> 03:01.232
We have not been able to enjoy ourselves much.

03:01.313 --> 03:03.560
If we could we would not [even] shun the jails,

03:03.640 --> 03:06.327
I mean I would be happy in a jail I tell you,

03:06.407 --> 03:09.259
because I can enjoy myself there better!

03:09.339 --> 03:13.245
But the one thing is there, you cannot enjoy yourself so much

03:13.325 --> 03:16.602
when you cannot share it with others also isn’t it?

03:16.682 --> 03:21.623
It becomes like that. Without sharing you cannot enjoy yourself.

03:22.745 --> 03:25.887
And that’s what should happen to all the Sahaja Yogis.

03:25.967 --> 03:30.288
At that level you should come. We should be at that level.

03:30.368 --> 03:34.040
Try to keep your level that high, is important.

03:34.120 --> 03:39.377
Sometimes you come down, you start criticizing others.

03:39.458 --> 03:42.331
Others are also not right, for example, somebody sees somebody

03:42.411 --> 03:44.456
filthy, dirty, something like that.

03:44.536 --> 03:46.563
The person who’s filthy, dirty, of course

03:46.644 --> 03:49.075
there’s something wrong with that person, no doubt,

03:49.156 --> 03:52.521
but that person should be pitied. At least he should be clean.

03:52.601 --> 03:55.609
I mean, that’s the minimum of minimum.

03:56.368 --> 03:58.995
But instead of that if you start criticizing that person,

03:59.076 --> 04:02.582
you also become filthy in your language,
filthy in your mind and everything,

04:02.663 --> 04:06.144
so why [do it]? Leave it! Let that person improve by himself,

04:06.224 --> 04:11.151
to see that he has to be clean, he has
to be neat, he has to be sensible.

04:12.111 --> 04:15.768
This is to be seen by that person himself and not by you.

04:15.848 --> 04:17.934
Where is your attention?

04:19.646 --> 04:23.483
It’s a habit in India, all the parents will
ask the children when they are standing,

04:23.564 --> 04:27.368
“Where is your attention?”  “Where is my attention?” alright.

04:27.449 --> 04:30.216
Then again he’s standing there, “Where is your attention?”

04:30.296 --> 04:33.394
Again he’ll be on the watch [out], “Where is my attention gone?”

04:33.474 --> 04:36.017
We have to look after our attention, that’s all.

04:36.097 --> 04:40.003
“Where is my attention? Is it on the Spirit?”

04:43.848 --> 04:47.189
I hope this time we are going to achieve a lot because

04:47.270 --> 04:50.142
I have a feeling that this time, in all the pujas,

04:50.223 --> 04:53.799
I am really working very, very hard — very hard.

04:53.879 --> 04:58.016
And if you people little bit, little bit decide

04:59.364 --> 05:04.642
that we are not here for enjoyment, for
buying clothes or saris or anything,

05:04.722 --> 05:07.546
but we are here for our ascent.

05:08.059 --> 05:13.509
If that is decided in your hearts, I’m sure it will work out.

05:13.589 --> 05:16.432
Please try to control your attention.

05:16.565 --> 05:19.243
Control it. Chitta niroda. Control it.

05:19.323 --> 05:23.563
Where is it going? See, “Where is my attention going?

05:23.854 --> 05:25.843
Ask, “Where is the attention going?”

05:25.923 --> 05:29.115
Ask yourself, “Am I there or am I out?”

05:29.195 --> 05:34.111
Otherwise you’ll have very funny awareness,

05:34.191 --> 05:36.183
very funny awareness.

05:39.783 --> 05:43.790
But the most thing is, that in your heart, in your mind,

05:43.870 --> 05:46.352
don’t allow funny ideas to come in.

05:46.432 --> 05:48.435
First of all watch what’s in your mind.

05:48.515 --> 05:53.259
It will give you ideas like, ‘This man is not good,
that man is not good.’

05:53.339 --> 05:57.338
Just don’t listen to these things, just listen to yourself,

05:57.418 --> 06:02.472
that ‘Where am I?’ ‘What am I doing?’
‘What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?’

06:02.552 --> 06:05.926
‘My vibrations – are they all right?’ ‘Am I helping others?’

06:06.006 --> 06:09.665
‘Where is my attention?’ The attention has to be:

06:09.745 --> 06:12.724
‘What am I doing with what Mother has given to me?’

06:15.678 --> 06:18.233
Now at Vishuddhi as you know we are collective

06:18.340 --> 06:20.677
and we have connections with others.

06:20.757 --> 06:23.816
So He said all this is a ‘leela’ [play]

06:23.896 --> 06:30.743
and in a very playful, mirthful way you should be with others

06:30.823 --> 06:35.702
and great friendly with others and create relationships.

06:35.782 --> 06:39.099
So this is the Vishuddhi chakra.

06:39.179 --> 06:45.733
But the other point I tried to say that the relation with others,

06:45.813 --> 06:50.050
anything if it does not have depth, it is superficial,

06:50.130 --> 06:54.959
if it is for ego or for some conditioning
or some calculations of the mind.

06:55.039 --> 06:59.696
If at a mental level if you are friendly with anyone

06:59.776 --> 07:03.168
or for emotional level if you are friendly with anyone,

07:03.248 --> 07:05.487
without any depth in yourself,

07:05.567 --> 07:11.275
it can be very temporary and will have no effect whatsoever.

07:11.356 --> 07:14.296
So you have to have depth and to get to the depth,

07:14.376 --> 07:17.175
you must look after your Agnya chakra.

07:17.255 --> 07:20.770
And the Agnya chakra is nothing but your attention.

07:20.850 --> 07:29.300
If your attention is all the time roaming
about paying attention to 1001 thing,

07:29.380 --> 07:33.920
then you cannot develop that concentrated penetration

07:34.000 --> 07:40.500
of your attention into things and whatever you do is very superficial.

07:40.580 --> 07:42.435
It’s not joy giving.

07:42.515 --> 07:48.965
So the combination should be that you should look after your Vishuddhi

07:49.045 --> 07:53.452
– of today for example you can have a very
playful, mirthful time together.

07:53.532 --> 07:55.691
Enjoy with each other;

07:55.945 --> 08:01.437
but you have to know that it has to come from your heart

08:01.517 --> 08:04.202
or from your Spirit.

08:04.282 --> 08:06.155
So how to touch that?

08:06.235 --> 08:10.975
That depth can only be possible if your attention is on the Spirit

08:11.055 --> 08:13.662
and not on frivolous things.

08:14.254 --> 08:18.560
Because of that you’ll become thoughtlessly
aware when you’ll be enjoying.

08:18.640 --> 08:23.373
And that whatever you’ll do it will be very genuine,

08:23.453 --> 08:27.843
it will not have artificiality.

08:27.923 --> 08:31.911
That is why the second part is after ‘leela’;

08:31.997 --> 08:34.246
what you call is the ‘jana’ part

08:34.326 --> 08:37.573
where it is the collectivity.

08:37.916 --> 08:43.333
Higher chakra is Agnya where it is ‘tapah’ – means penance.

08:43.453 --> 08:45.059
You have to go through the penance.

08:45.139 --> 08:48.101
And now in Sahaja Yoga penance is not food,

08:48.181 --> 08:50.775
is not other useless things

08:50.855 --> 08:54.477
but what is the most important is to control your attention.

08:54.557 --> 08:56.216
Where does it go?

08:56.296 --> 08:58.933
Does it go to your worries, to your troubles,

08:59.014 --> 09:01.697
to your past, to this, to others?

09:01.777 --> 09:05.263
Or does it go to your Spirit?

09:06.123 --> 09:10.530
This is important to see that your attention is on your Spirit.

09:11.689 --> 09:15.449
If your attention is on you Spirit, then you get that depth,

09:15.575 --> 09:18.647
that genuiness in your relationship with others.
