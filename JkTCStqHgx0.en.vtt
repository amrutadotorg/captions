WEBVTT

00:00.420 --> 00:04.060
- It's that where the cities work.
- You can go for your work.

00:06.400 --> 00:10.000
Staying in the city is not so good for sahaja yogis.

00:11.140 --> 00:17.700
You see, vibration-wise and also not good for your lungs, you see.

00:18.560 --> 00:21.540
It's better to be little away if you want to meditate and

00:21.900 --> 00:29.180
First and foremost thing is that you have to ascend; For that you should be in a place which will help you to ascend

00:30.540 --> 00:36.260
otherwise if you live in the city, the city have baba, the city all nonsense - can't even meditate properly

00:36.860 --> 00:43.960
and it's so polluted, it spoils your lungs completely. So it would be nice, it would be little away from the city.

00:46.280 --> 00:49.360
Try to find some house of that kind

00:51.320 --> 00:57.940
and first you have to give a mortgage for that house which you can do all of you put together

00:58.600 --> 01:05.240
and then you have to pay the rent of the house as the mortgage, part of the mortgage, so you own it also.

01:07.280 --> 01:12.760
I think, we desire for some time [UNCLEAR], I'll let You know, Mother.

01:14.580 --> 01:22.520
- [UNCLEAR]
- He's saying, "I have desired for some time to earn something rather than pay rent."

01:23.640 --> 01:30.840
You see if you can, whatever is possible, you see, if you can own something, nothing like it but can you -

01:31.220 --> 01:39.360
you see, this is the way I said that you first pay the first installment - I'd like to know what is it?

01:40.560 --> 01:47.800
How much do you have to pay for the first installment? They said, " It is 10%." If you take a big house,

01:48.160 --> 01:52.760
then 10% would be quite a lot then can somebody pay so much?

01:53.980 --> 01:58.720
- No, so then renting is the best.
- Long journeys

02:00.240 --> 02:06.820
I mean, in sahaja terms 20 years is not, is an awful long time but

02:07.620 --> 02:11.880
in terms of a lease it's not very long. You can ask for 20 years lease and

02:17.240 --> 02:22.320
It can be more; In London you can get it for 99 years lease, you see

02:22.800 --> 02:29.360
and so you can shift to a place like that and there's also some short leases also - that's very cheap.

02:31.160 --> 02:36.260
So you have to go through all that because you can't afford to pay the basic [DEPOSIT].

02:36.680 --> 02:41.200
Like in Melbourne, somebody has offered 30 thousand

02:43.140 --> 02:46.440
but with 30 thousand, three hundred thousand

02:46.720 --> 02:51.500
pounds worth of thing - is it big enough, yeah - if you are outside?

02:51.760 --> 02:57.380
Yes Shrimataji, real estate is not as expensive in Brisbane or around Brisbane.

02:57.660 --> 03:04.160
- but you check this side
- It's much cheaper here; Real estate is much cheaper here.
- I see.

03:04.980 --> 03:08.980
So how much, do you think, a big house will cost here?

03:11.120 --> 03:15.680
- Hardly 70 thousand.
- Very big house?
- Big house

03:16.040 --> 03:21.180
- Two hundred, say two hundred thousand
- Two hundred thousand

03:21.380 --> 03:27.260
so 10% would be 20 thousand, so you'll have to put in about 10 thousand pounds, alright?

03:27.820 --> 03:33.500
I can organize that 10 thousand - I'll see. Then, is it alright?

03:34.720 --> 03:39.117
- Then you can pay the mortgage?
- I'm not sure we would, Shri Mataji.

03:39.237 --> 03:44.517
Because if you have a lease for say 15, 20 years then you can pay.

03:45.746 --> 03:50.906
Shri Mataji, I live in a house in [UNCLEAR]

03:52.586 --> 03:59.146
and so we could get some money by selling that house although that's a wise thing to do

03:59.346 --> 04:05.946
- just sold my house [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

04:06.766 --> 04:11.206
He has a house of his own which he could sell to get the money

04:11.646 --> 04:18.326
- I just could, I can't hear because of [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, better [UNCLEAR] it down

04:19.046 --> 04:25.726
- So?
- He says that he has a house that he earns, because he could sell to raise money but he doesn't know whether that's a good idea.

04:26.146 --> 04:32.126
Why not, if you can sell that, you can have another bigger house

04:32.426 --> 04:36.806
and in the rent you can have mortgage as well as they can pay back your money.

04:37.366 --> 04:42.966
I think what Mother is saying if you did that, you would be in your house and you would rent it to the collective.

04:44.826 --> 04:49.386
- So in fact you could [UNCLEAR]
- No, no, no that he cannot do because

04:49.566 --> 04:53.826
you see, the amount that he'll have to pay - how much would you fetch from your house?

04:55.046 --> 04:58.226
- Mother, I get eighty thousand
- About?

04:58.546 --> 05:01.546
- Eighty thousand
- That doesn't solve the problem

05:01.806 --> 05:07.246
- It's a big, big deposit eighty thousand.
- Yes it is big deposit

05:07.506 --> 05:12.246
but that doesn't solve the problem; They have to get the mortgage as well.

05:12.646 --> 05:17.626
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Alright. Then you can compensate it. With the rent

05:18.126 --> 05:24.746
- he can take his own money and the money can go to mortgage as well.
- Hmm. Oh, yes, yes.

05:26.466 --> 05:34.106
I'll show the house and if that's suitable option was taken would the house be mine

05:34.306 --> 05:40.206
Yes, to be, to be this thing, the house should be in your name and mortgage has to be taken - alright?

05:40.486 --> 05:44.986
and that mortgage can be completed by the rent of these people that they are giving

05:45.486 --> 05:50.106
plus you can also, they can pay you the money that you have paid for.

05:51.406 --> 05:56.246
Alright, so that that house then becomes the house of these people.

05:56.866 --> 06:03.186
Naturally, once they've paid you back then that house becomes the collective property.

06:05.146 --> 06:10.386
Mother, You, You said in the other cities that You want people to live together.

06:11.006 --> 06:16.186
- Yes.
- He's thinking of having a lot of people in one place for

06:16.806 --> 06:23.246
- a lot of smaller [UNCLEAR] spread around.
- No, no, no. You should have

06:23.926 --> 06:29.166
- one big house in which all of you should live - like Burwood.
- Yes, Mother.

06:30.206 --> 06:34.826
That's My - the children and everyone and you could even have a school.

06:38.386 --> 06:45.746
As many as can live in that. They should sell all - all of them should sell their houses and adjust it.

06:48.726 --> 06:55.446
There're some very nice properties, not very far from here, where you can buy an acre or so of land

06:56.106 --> 06:59.086
and still be very close to the city.

07:00.026 --> 07:05.866
It's much better this kind of thing, if you can do it. Nothing like it if that works out, nothing like it.

07:10.766 --> 07:17.966
Yes, in Brisbane you can do that - it is still small. In Sydney if you want to go out - it takes all day to get there.

07:18.526 --> 07:25.006
- [UNCLEAR]
- In Brisbane it's possible to do that - you want to have a land outside

07:25.286 --> 07:32.246
- because it's still very close but in Sydney it takes you half a day to get there so it's not good.
- That's correct.

07:32.486 --> 07:36.466
- So you'll buy the land you mean to say - is he saying so?
- He could

07:36.986 --> 07:41.986
- No it's - then mortgage you can't get na? If you have a house
- You have to build the house on it

07:42.606 --> 07:48.006
- They give mortgage for building the house?
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, particularly if you own the land

07:49.306 --> 07:56.286
- Is it so? Then you can work it out.
- You have options.

07:58.346 --> 08:06.326
A large house, no house and build the house you want [UNCLEAR] you are in Perth, fine, possibly.

08:06.526 --> 08:09.346
- Renovating
- Renovating

08:09.546 --> 08:12.566
- He now working her out
- Yes, Mother.

08:17.666 --> 08:22.626
First you must find out a big property which is already there - it'll be better.

08:22.846 --> 08:27.766
- [UNCLEAR - I ASKED?] already there.
- Yes, that is the best.

08:28.006 --> 08:33.266
Then renovate it or alter it to suit. Possibly add on to it.

08:34.146 --> 08:41.546
For the time being, I think, that's a better idea is to get the house and put the deposit there

08:42.006 --> 08:49.966
and start it in the big house a big property. Also they know each [UNCLEAR] and then charge the rent from the people

08:50.366 --> 08:54.966
which will repay your money as well as the mortgage.

08:57.466 --> 09:03.646
- Better now? You put it here also
- Yes, Mother.
- To that side

09:08.406 --> 09:15.326
- [UNCLEAR] lunch and then rest, alright. Could I have some lunch?
- Yes

09:15.566 --> 09:22.226
I think, you just sit down and first of all, find out. If you have the newspaper, I might be able to see something.

09:23.146 --> 09:27.866
[LAUGHTER] Let's have the newspaper.

09:28.726 --> 09:34.886
Everyday you have to find out - it's very easy. How we got Shudy Camp? How we did it? I mean, it's all remarkable!

09:35.186 --> 09:38.426
In sahaja yoga every thing works out, if you have desire.

09:39.446 --> 09:46.846
They have to have pure desire and do not go on diverting your mind. Just put your attention to it. You want to have an ashram - it will work.

10:00.286 --> 10:03.206
- [UNCLEAR] Little table
- Hmm

10:04.806 --> 10:09.126
- Where would You like to have Your lunch Mother?
- Inside.
- Inside

10:09.686 --> 10:15.266
- [YOGIS CONVERSING]
- I'll see to

10:15.586 --> 10:20.146
- [UNCLEAR] for tonight.
- It's beautiful!

10:22.706 --> 10:29.726
- There were three [UNCLEAR] in three different packets
- Friday, yesterday and today, Mother

10:31.246 --> 10:35.406
- Yeah.
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

10:47.426 --> 10:50.606
[UNCLEAR] color again.

11:39.426 --> 11:42.666
Even London it's selling here

11:55.446 --> 11:58.566
Where do you have this?

12:09.286 --> 12:15.086
- This is for the whole of the Australia?
- [UNCLEAR]

12:22.966 --> 12:28.946
- They have also the same mantras, save dollars
- Plus payment

12:33.326 --> 12:39.006
[UNCLEAR] They have got royal [UNCLEAR] things and all these for sale.

12:42.626 --> 12:47.786
[UNCLEAR]

13:04.186 --> 13:12.146
- This is for Victoria?
- No, for Queensland, Shri Mataji.
- This is all Victoria.

13:13.206 --> 13:18.906
No, no this is all, this is the  Golf course, New South Wales, this is all Central and North Queensland

13:23.286 --> 13:27.726
These all places are all too far away have to be houses

13:29.326 --> 13:37.406
- It is not
- Saturday is the best paper, much better [UNCLEAR]

13:40.706 --> 13:46.226
Quite cheap this one is - see; Five bedrooms, stately home, plus five what

13:47.126 --> 13:52.486
- 106
- 106
- Just imagine!

14:00.166 --> 14:07.146
- Which one?
- [UNCLEAR]

14:07.786 --> 14:13.206
- About 60 kilometers away. It's too far
- Hot?
- [UNCLEAR]

14:14.246 --> 14:20.306
I don't think this paper is very good, Shri Mataji. They don't put very much in here Sunday paper; It's all in a Saturday

14:20.566 --> 14:24.946
- [UNCLEAR] No, you see, this was
- Sixty miles away it's too far

14:25.186 --> 14:28.286
- Oh, I see.
- that's why it's cheap

14:40.406 --> 14:44.286
This is the Saturday paper [UNCLEAR]

16:24.326 --> 16:30.166
- Excuse me Shri Mataji. Would you like some [UNCLEAR - FRUIT?]?
- Now, just see this one.

16:34.706 --> 16:38.726
There are for renovation also some - it's quite big.

16:40.026 --> 16:44.366
- This one is [UNCLEAR]
- Very far away?
- That's very far

16:44.666 --> 16:52.246
- Very far away?
- No, it's about ten kilometers from here, Mother.
- It's not much ten kilometers

16:53.826 --> 16:58.026
- There's another one, quite big.
- Yeah, it's bigger - expensive.

16:58.426 --> 17:02.486
- This will be
- They've not given.
- half a million dollars.
- But here it's uh..

17:07.606 --> 17:11.726
- This one is nice
- Yes
- and this is some for renovation also.

17:13.446 --> 17:20.266
- This whole thing Mother is the old Queensland [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm

17:20.626 --> 17:26.126
-  and underneath you can do [UNCLEAR] as well - add two floors.
- This is for renovation but is it alright?

17:28.226 --> 17:33.186
- This is
- Area. Annh?
- in a city, very close to the city
- So?

17:36.886 --> 17:42.446
- Price is not there.
- This is for auction, means go auctions.
- Let us see this.
- Hmm

17:42.726 --> 17:49.026
If you are on the lookout, you might get this. Quite nice; I think, it's quite big also but it hasn't got too many bedrooms and

17:51.646 --> 17:56.746
This fairly small block of land is over 20, 21.6 purchase.

17:57.366 --> 18:02.686
- Means quite small?
- Uh.. It's about three quarters of the size of this block.
- Uhh!

18:03.486 --> 18:07.506
- Very small!
- Yes, Mother.

18:09.366 --> 18:16.586
- This is extra large, they said, 'This is extra large house.'
- Hmm. This one looks nice, Mother.
- Hmm.
- Three [UNCLEAR]

18:19.686 --> 18:24.926
- This also is auctioned?
- Yes. This big block of land 56 purchase.

18:25.626 --> 18:28.906
[UNCLEAR]

18:29.146 --> 18:34.086
- This is nice, I think, this looks alright.Why not see this one?
- Yes, Mother.

18:36.086 --> 18:39.526
This looks alright to Me.

18:42.426 --> 18:49.206
- It's quite spread out
- Yes, Mother.
- Good, then you can do something more than, if the land is too much

18:54.886 --> 19:02.366
and they say, 'Extra large'. This one is

19:05.626 --> 19:10.846
- It's far away?
- Uh.., somewhere outside, yes.

19:11.366 --> 19:17.186
- It's about 15 kilometers from the city, that's 20 kilometers from here.
- Uh huh.

19:18.646 --> 19:26.706
- This [UNCLEAR] is only 10 kilometers you said.
- Yes, but the other thing also is some of the children have started in some schools

19:27.266 --> 19:33.586
- and we better have them going to the same schools, perhaps,  rather than have them change
- To what schools they are going to?

19:33.806 --> 19:41.326
Uh.. this boy Chris is going to High school this year and [UNCLEAR] State School

19:42.726 --> 19:46.746
and so we were thinking of standing [UNCLEAR] in the city.

19:47.406 --> 19:54.886
No, but they can come to the school - no problem. See, what I'm trying to say is that, after some time we'll send them to India, isn't it, in any case.

19:55.426 --> 20:02.286
It's a question of... [LAUGHTER]

20:11.126 --> 20:18.486
- This one, Mother [UNCLEAR] 10 acres.
- But acres what to do - you can't do anything, na.

20:19.346 --> 20:26.966
- Unnh?
- Nice and quiet in there [UNCLEAR]
- No, no but, you see, you cannot, if you have such a lot of acres, what do you do there?

20:28.706 --> 20:36.446
- Look at that, is it helpful?
- Umm. It could be used for farming or growing vegetables.

20:36.986 --> 20:43.466
- [UNCLEAR]
- There's a dam on it. Probably something about one acre will be there or half acre

20:43.726 --> 20:50.146
- Has too much, you see, is a waste; You can't build anything - if you can, then it's alright.

21:06.266 --> 21:09.326
[UNCLEAR - DO NOT?] have too much space.

21:25.586 --> 21:28.726
This one is [UNCLEAR - VERY BIG?]

21:31.946 --> 21:36.786
-  Here this, this is in a city again -
-  Unnh, very big
- houses will be very close together.

21:37.886 --> 21:43.406
- Not very big blocks are there
- About six, six acres is alright?

21:44.106 --> 21:49.106
- Each [UNCLEAR -FRONT?] is for [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm. It's located 800 kilometers away

21:49.566 --> 21:56.386
- Too much! So you have to find out something about, between six and ten.

21:56.766 --> 22:04.306
You see something like that? Something. You can. I mean, if you are on the lookout you can easily find out - no problem.[UNCLEAR]

22:06.586 --> 22:11.446
- Hamilton - very far away?
- Ah.. no Mother, it is just across the river.

22:11.666 --> 22:16.886
- That's where
- You know, I listened you out. I think, I can get you on a 845 plane out of Auckland

22:17.086 --> 22:22.626
- Oh, that's very good!
- which will get You in early in the, You know, mid-morning.
- Yes, that's alright! That's very good.

22:23.966 --> 22:30.746
- This is where all the very rich people live.[UNCLEAR]
- Is it? But you can live there - why not? [UNCLEAR - YOU ARE NO LESS?]

22:31.006 --> 22:38.766
- It's on the way to the airport, Mother; It's very nice.
- It's a very big block of land
- Let's see, let's see
- Half acre.

22:41.866 --> 22:49.586
- See it's very good is the area is, square meter is not much. Two thousand - two thousand is not much
- Less than half an acre.

22:50.306 --> 22:57.326
- Oh, I see - is the area
- Yes.
- What is it? How much you have here?

23:00.246 --> 23:05.066
- Four bedrooms.
- Won't work out
- Yes Mother.

23:07.866 --> 23:13.926
- Need not go to a place which has got few this things but this is very far away, you said.

23:14.286 --> 23:17.326
- Yes Mother - 800 kilometers
- Hmm.

23:20.086 --> 23:26.026
You have to find out, I mean, I don't know where - which is the closer and which is not but, you see, there're so many

23:26.226 --> 23:32.526
every Saturday. Just go through them and see for yourself whatever you like. These are all for

23:32.906 --> 23:38.906
- uh.. this is all for auctions, I think.
- Yes.
- Why do they auction it?

23:40.166 --> 23:44.926
- The more expensive ones will be auctioned.
- Oh!
- So the agents make more money.

24:04.626 --> 24:11.046
This, this kind of thing you should see always because you can renovate them and they are better houses always.

24:16.506 --> 24:23.146
- And I don't know which place is - what is this one is?
- This is [UNCLEAR], this is across the river

24:24.426 --> 24:30.546
- but that is 5 kilometers from here
- Hmm
- It's again a very expensive area

24:30.746 --> 24:37.346
Unnh. It will be, it is [ UNCLEAR] in the, it will be. You should try to make it a

24:38.446 --> 24:46.306
little out; Also good for children. You see, the atmosphere in the city is not so good for their lungs and things - it's also difficult

24:53.586 --> 24:56.606
Where is Cashmere Place?

25:02.346 --> 25:07.586
- I don't know that one, Mother.
- It is not so expensive.

25:08.786 --> 25:13.506
- The houses don't seem to be very expensive here, I don't see
- This is the cheapest place in Australia

25:13.726 --> 25:17.386
- Which one?
- Brisbane is cheapest place in Australia.
- Then you should, you should have, then why not?

25:25.566 --> 25:28.706
Very cheap!

25:42.966 --> 25:47.986
Here they have not written how much [UNCLEAR]

25:50.086 --> 25:53.346
- Three bedroom
- Three bedroom
- [UNCLEAR]

25:57.986 --> 26:00.926
You can find out.

26:03.966 --> 26:09.086
Children should be out. I don't like them to stay in the cities - it's not good.

26:09.326 --> 26:12.366
They get all the bad things of the city only

26:13.326 --> 26:19.826
- Here lots of nice places are near the
- [UNCLEAR]
- near the ocean.
- [UNCLEAR - YEAH?]

27:15.346 --> 27:19.626
It's quite good; I don't know how many bedrooms [UNCLEAR]

27:20.586 --> 27:25.926
- Three bedrooms [UNCLEAR]
- Three bedrooms and study

27:29.746 --> 27:37.706
- You will find out - it's not difficult. If it's for renovation, it will be cheaper and we all can renovate it, you see.
- Yes, Mother.

27:46.326 --> 27:52.546
It's simple. You should sit down nicely with about five, six newspapers

27:52.766 --> 27:56.546
and give it to everyone. Let them sit down and find out for themselves

27:56.746 --> 28:02.246
[UNCLEAR] and if it is for renovation, nothing like it because then you can renovate it the way you like

28:03.066 --> 28:06.706
- and lots of things you can do with it
- and get together to do the work

28:06.926 --> 28:12.106
- Yes, that's a very good idea.
- Yeah
- When you live there, [UNCLEAR] renovating it also

28:14.826 --> 28:20.446
Better now? Little ice has cured you - just imagine.

28:21.286 --> 28:27.126
Doctors will not tell you what is - virus, this, that all kinds of stories.

28:27.786 --> 28:33.766
Then I take your leave now, I leave it to you people. Sit down properly and just find out

28:34.146 --> 28:38.526
because making it will be difficult. You are getting them so cheap just now, maybe,

28:38.826 --> 28:43.776
that the prices are low - why not buy one? Then we'll see about it later.

28:47.126 --> 28:50.186
Alright, may God bless you!

28:52.486 --> 28:58.466
- This chair is a rocking chair.
- You want [UNCLEAR]
