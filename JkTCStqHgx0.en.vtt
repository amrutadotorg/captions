00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.060
- It's that where the cities work.
- You can go for your work.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.000
Staying in the city is not so good for sahaja yogis.

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:17.700
You see, vibration-wise and also not good for your lungs, you see.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.540
It's better to be little away if you want to meditate and

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:29.180
First and foremost thing is that you have to ascend; For that you should be in a place which will help you to ascend

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.260
otherwise if you live in the city, the city have baba, the city all nonsense - can't even meditate properly

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:43.960
and it's so polluted, it spoils your lungs completely. So it would be nice, it would be little away from the city.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.360
Try to find some house of that kind

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.940
and first you have to give a mortgage for that house which you can do all of you put together

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.240
and then you have to pay the rent of the house as the mortgage, part of the mortgage, so you own it also.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.760
I think, we desire for some time [UNCLEAR], I'll let You know, Mother.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.520
- [UNCLEAR]
- He's saying, "I have desired for some time to earn something rather than pay rent."

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.840
You see if you can, whatever is possible, you see, if you can own something, nothing like it but can you -

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.360
you see, this is the way I said that you first pay the first installment - I'd like to know what is it?

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.800
How much do you have to pay for the first installment? They said, " It is 10%." If you take a big house,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.760
then 10% would be quite a lot then can somebody pay so much?

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:58.720
- No, so then renting is the best.
- Long journeys

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.820
I mean, in sahaja terms 20 years is not, is an awful long time but

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.880
in terms of a lease it's not very long. You can ask for 20 years lease and

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.320
It can be more; In London you can get it for 99 years lease, you see

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.360
and so you can shift to a place like that and there's also some short leases also - that's very cheap.

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.260
So you have to go through all that because you can't afford to pay the basic [DEPOSIT].

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.200
Like in Melbourne, somebody has offered 30 thousand

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.440
but with 30 thousand, three hundred thousand

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.500
pounds worth of thing - is it big enough, yeah - if you are outside?

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:57.380
Yes Shrimataji, real estate is not as expensive in Brisbane or around Brisbane.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:04.160
- but you check this side
- It's much cheaper here; Real estate is much cheaper here.
- I see.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.980
So how much, do you think, a big house will cost here?

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.680
- Hardly 70 thousand.
- Very big house?
- Big house

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.180
- Two hundred, say two hundred thousand
- Two hundred thousand

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:27.260
so 10% would be 20 thousand, so you'll have to put in about 10 thousand pounds, alright?

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.500
I can organize that 10 thousand - I'll see. Then, is it alright?

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.117
- Then you can pay the mortgage?
- I'm not sure we would, Shri Mataji.

00:03:39.237 --> 00:03:44.517
Because if you have a lease for say 15, 20 years then you can pay.

00:03:45.746 --> 00:03:50.906
Shri Mataji, I live in a house in [UNCLEAR]

00:03:52.586 --> 00:03:59.146
and so we could get some money by selling that house although that's a wise thing to do

00:03:59.346 --> 00:04:05.946
- just sold my house [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:11.206
He has a house of his own which he could sell to get the money

00:04:11.646 --> 00:04:18.326
- I just could, I can't hear because of [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yes, better [UNCLEAR] it down

00:04:19.046 --> 00:04:25.726
- So?
- He says that he has a house that he earns, because he could sell to raise money but he doesn't know whether that's a good idea.

00:04:26.146 --> 00:04:32.126
Why not, if you can sell that, you can have another bigger house

00:04:32.426 --> 00:04:36.806
and in the rent you can have mortgage as well as they can pay back your money.

00:04:37.366 --> 00:04:42.966
I think what Mother is saying if you did that, you would be in your house and you would rent it to the collective.

00:04:44.826 --> 00:04:49.386
- So in fact you could [UNCLEAR]
- No, no, no that he cannot do because

00:04:49.566 --> 00:04:53.826
you see, the amount that he'll have to pay - how much would you fetch from your house?

00:04:55.046 --> 00:04:58.226
- Mother, I get eighty thousand
- About?

00:04:58.546 --> 00:05:01.546
- Eighty thousand
- That doesn't solve the problem

00:05:01.806 --> 00:05:07.246
- It's a big, big deposit eighty thousand.
- Yes it is big deposit

00:05:07.506 --> 00:05:12.246
but that doesn't solve the problem; They have to get the mortgage as well.

00:05:12.646 --> 00:05:17.626
- Oh, yes, yes.
- Alright. Then you can compensate it. With the rent

00:05:18.126 --> 00:05:24.746
- he can take his own money and the money can go to mortgage as well.
- Hmm. Oh, yes, yes.

00:05:26.466 --> 00:05:34.106
I'll show the house and if that's suitable option was taken would the house be mine

00:05:34.306 --> 00:05:40.206
Yes, to be, to be this thing, the house should be in your name and mortgage has to be taken - alright?

00:05:40.486 --> 00:05:44.986
and that mortgage can be completed by the rent of these people that they are giving

00:05:45.486 --> 00:05:50.106
plus you can also, they can pay you the money that you have paid for.

00:05:51.406 --> 00:05:56.246
Alright, so that that house then becomes the house of these people.

00:05:56.866 --> 00:06:03.186
Naturally, once they've paid you back then that house becomes the collective property.

00:06:05.146 --> 00:06:10.386
Mother, You, You said in the other cities that You want people to live together.

00:06:11.006 --> 00:06:16.186
- Yes.
- He's thinking of having a lot of people in one place for

00:06:16.806 --> 00:06:23.246
- a lot of smaller [UNCLEAR] spread around.
- No, no, no. You should have

00:06:23.926 --> 00:06:29.166
- one big house in which all of you should live - like Burwood.
- Yes, Mother.

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:34.826
That's My - the children and everyone and you could even have a school.

00:06:38.386 --> 00:06:45.746
As many as can live in that. They should sell all - all of them should sell their houses and adjust it.

00:06:48.726 --> 00:06:55.446
There're some very nice properties, not very far from here, where you can buy an acre or so of land

00:06:56.106 --> 00:06:59.086
and still be very close to the city.

00:07:00.026 --> 00:07:05.866
It's much better this kind of thing, if you can do it. Nothing like it if that works out, nothing like it.

00:07:10.766 --> 00:07:17.966
Yes, in Brisbane you can do that - it is still small. In Sydney if you want to go out - it takes all day to get there.

00:07:18.526 --> 00:07:25.006
- [UNCLEAR]
- In Brisbane it's possible to do that - you want to have a land outside

00:07:25.286 --> 00:07:32.246
- because it's still very close but in Sydney it takes you half a day to get there so it's not good.
- That's correct.

00:07:32.486 --> 00:07:36.466
- So you'll buy the land you mean to say - is he saying so?
- He could

00:07:36.986 --> 00:07:41.986
- No it's - then mortgage you can't get na? If you have a house
- You have to build the house on it

00:07:42.606 --> 00:07:48.006
- They give mortgage for building the house?
- Oh, yes.
- Yes, particularly if you own the land

00:07:49.306 --> 00:07:56.286
- Is it so? Then you can work it out.
- You have options.

00:07:58.346 --> 00:08:06.326
A large house, no house and build the house you want [UNCLEAR] you are in Perth, fine, possibly.

00:08:06.526 --> 00:08:09.346
- Renovating
- Renovating

00:08:09.546 --> 00:08:12.566
- He now working her out
- Yes, Mother.

00:08:17.666 --> 00:08:22.626
First you must find out a big property which is already there - it'll be better.

00:08:22.846 --> 00:08:27.766
- [UNCLEAR - I ASKED?] already there.
- Yes, that is the best.

00:08:28.006 --> 00:08:33.266
Then renovate it or alter it to suit. Possibly add on to it.

00:08:34.146 --> 00:08:41.546
For the time being, I think, that's a better idea is to get the house and put the deposit there

00:08:42.006 --> 00:08:49.966
and start it in the big house a big property. Also they know each [UNCLEAR] and then charge the rent from the people

00:08:50.366 --> 00:08:54.966
which will repay your money as well as the mortgage.

00:08:57.466 --> 00:09:03.646
- Better now? You put it here also
- Yes, Mother.
- To that side

00:09:08.406 --> 00:09:15.326
- [UNCLEAR] lunch and then rest, alright. Could I have some lunch?
- Yes

00:09:15.566 --> 00:09:22.226
I think, you just sit down and first of all, find out. If you have the newspaper, I might be able to see something.

00:09:23.146 --> 00:09:27.866
[LAUGHTER] Let's have the newspaper.

00:09:28.726 --> 00:09:34.886
Everyday you have to find out - it's very easy. How we got Shudy Camp? How we did it? I mean, it's all remarkable!

00:09:35.186 --> 00:09:38.426
In sahaja yoga every thing works out, if you have desire.

00:09:39.446 --> 00:09:46.846
They have to have pure desire and do not go on diverting your mind. Just put your attention to it. You want to have an ashram - it will work.

00:10:00.286 --> 00:10:03.206
- [UNCLEAR] Little table
- Hmm

00:10:04.806 --> 00:10:09.126
- Where would You like to have Your lunch Mother?
- Inside.
- Inside

00:10:09.686 --> 00:10:15.266
- [YOGIS CONVERSING]
- I'll see to

00:10:15.586 --> 00:10:20.146
- [UNCLEAR] for tonight.
- It's beautiful!

00:10:22.706 --> 00:10:29.726
- There were three [UNCLEAR] in three different packets
- Friday, yesterday and today, Mother

00:10:31.246 --> 00:10:35.406
- Yeah.
- [UNCLEAR]
- [UNCLEAR]

00:10:47.426 --> 00:10:50.606
[UNCLEAR] color again.

00:11:39.426 --> 00:11:42.666
Even London it's selling here

00:11:55.446 --> 00:11:58.566
Where do you have this?

00:12:09.286 --> 00:12:15.086
- This is for the whole of the Australia?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:12:22.966 --> 00:12:28.946
- They have also the same mantras, save dollars
- Plus payment

00:12:33.326 --> 00:12:39.006
[UNCLEAR] They have got royal [UNCLEAR] things and all these for sale.

00:12:42.626 --> 00:12:47.786
[UNCLEAR]

00:13:04.186 --> 00:13:12.146
- This is for Victoria?
- No, for Queensland, Shri Mataji.
- This is all Victoria.

00:13:13.206 --> 00:13:18.906
No, no this is all, this is the  Golf course, New South Wales, this is all Central and North Queensland

00:13:23.286 --> 00:13:27.726
These all places are all too far away have to be houses

00:13:29.326 --> 00:13:37.406
- It is not
- Saturday is the best paper, much better [UNCLEAR]

00:13:40.706 --> 00:13:46.226
Quite cheap this one is - see; Five bedrooms, stately home, plus five what

00:13:47.126 --> 00:13:52.486
- 106
- 106
- Just imagine!

00:14:00.166 --> 00:14:07.146
- Which one?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:14:07.786 --> 00:14:13.206
- About 60 kilometers away. It's too far
- Hot?
- [UNCLEAR]

00:14:14.246 --> 00:14:20.306
I don't think this paper is very good, Shri Mataji. They don't put very much in here Sunday paper; It's all in a Saturday

00:14:20.566 --> 00:14:24.946
- [UNCLEAR] No, you see, this was
- Sixty miles away it's too far

00:14:25.186 --> 00:14:28.286
- Oh, I see.
- that's why it's cheap

00:14:40.406 --> 00:14:44.286
This is the Saturday paper [UNCLEAR]

00:16:24.326 --> 00:16:30.166
- Excuse me Shri Mataji. Would you like some [UNCLEAR - FRUIT?]?
- Now, just see this one.

00:16:34.706 --> 00:16:38.726
There are for renovation also some - it's quite big.

00:16:40.026 --> 00:16:44.366
- This one is [UNCLEAR]
- Very far away?
- That's very far

00:16:44.666 --> 00:16:52.246
- Very far away?
- No, it's about ten kilometers from here, Mother.
- It's not much ten kilometers

00:16:53.826 --> 00:16:58.026
- There's another one, quite big.
- Yeah, it's bigger - expensive.

00:16:58.426 --> 00:17:02.486
- This will be
- They've not given.
- half a million dollars.
- But here it's uh..

00:17:07.606 --> 00:17:11.726
- This one is nice
- Yes
- and this is some for renovation also.

00:17:13.446 --> 00:17:20.266
- This whole thing Mother is the old Queensland [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm

00:17:20.626 --> 00:17:26.126
-  and underneath you can do [UNCLEAR] as well - add two floors.
- This is for renovation but is it alright?

00:17:28.226 --> 00:17:33.186
- This is
- Area. Annh?
- in a city, very close to the city
- So?

00:17:36.886 --> 00:17:42.446
- Price is not there.
- This is for auction, means go auctions.
- Let us see this.
- Hmm

00:17:42.726 --> 00:17:49.026
If you are on the lookout, you might get this. Quite nice; I think, it's quite big also but it hasn't got too many bedrooms and

00:17:51.646 --> 00:17:56.746
This fairly small block of land is over 20, 21.6 purchase.

00:17:57.366 --> 00:18:02.686
- Means quite small?
- Uh.. It's about three quarters of the size of this block.
- Uhh!

00:18:03.486 --> 00:18:07.506
- Very small!
- Yes, Mother.

00:18:09.366 --> 00:18:16.586
- This is extra large, they said, 'This is extra large house.'
- Hmm. This one looks nice, Mother.
- Hmm.
- Three [UNCLEAR]

00:18:19.686 --> 00:18:24.926
- This also is auctioned?
- Yes. This big block of land 56 purchase.

00:18:25.626 --> 00:18:28.906
[UNCLEAR]

00:18:29.146 --> 00:18:34.086
- This is nice, I think, this looks alright.Why not see this one?
- Yes, Mother.

00:18:36.086 --> 00:18:39.526
This looks alright to Me.

00:18:42.426 --> 00:18:49.206
- It's quite spread out
- Yes, Mother.
- Good, then you can do something more than, if the land is too much

00:18:54.886 --> 00:19:02.366
and they say, 'Extra large'. This one is

00:19:05.626 --> 00:19:10.846
- It's far away?
- Uh.., somewhere outside, yes.

00:19:11.366 --> 00:19:17.186
- It's about 15 kilometers from the city, that's 20 kilometers from here.
- Uh huh.

00:19:18.646 --> 00:19:26.706
- This [UNCLEAR] is only 10 kilometers you said.
- Yes, but the other thing also is some of the children have started in some schools

00:19:27.266 --> 00:19:33.586
- and we better have them going to the same schools, perhaps,  rather than have them change
- To what schools they are going to?

00:19:33.806 --> 00:19:41.326
Uh.. this boy Chris is going to High school this year and [UNCLEAR] State School

00:19:42.726 --> 00:19:46.746
and so we were thinking of standing [UNCLEAR] in the city.

00:19:47.406 --> 00:19:54.886
No, but they can come to the school - no problem. See, what I'm trying to say is that, after some time we'll send them to India, isn't it, in any case.

00:19:55.426 --> 00:20:02.286
It's a question of... [LAUGHTER]

00:20:11.126 --> 00:20:18.486
- This one, Mother [UNCLEAR] 10 acres.
- But acres what to do - you can't do anything, na.

00:20:19.346 --> 00:20:26.966
- Unnh?
- Nice and quiet in there [UNCLEAR]
- No, no but, you see, you cannot, if you have such a lot of acres, what do you do there?

00:20:28.706 --> 00:20:36.446
- Look at that, is it helpful?
- Umm. It could be used for farming or growing vegetables.

00:20:36.986 --> 00:20:43.466
- [UNCLEAR]
- There's a dam on it. Probably something about one acre will be there or half acre

00:20:43.726 --> 00:20:50.146
- Has too much, you see, is a waste; You can't build anything - if you can, then it's alright.

00:21:06.266 --> 00:21:09.326
[UNCLEAR - DO NOT?] have too much space.

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:28.726
This one is [UNCLEAR - VERY BIG?]

00:21:31.946 --> 00:21:36.786
-  Here this, this is in a city again -
-  Unnh, very big
- houses will be very close together.

00:21:37.886 --> 00:21:43.406
- Not very big blocks are there
- About six, six acres is alright?

00:21:44.106 --> 00:21:49.106
- Each [UNCLEAR -FRONT?] is for [UNCLEAR]
- Hmm. It's located 800 kilometers away

00:21:49.566 --> 00:21:56.386
- Too much! So you have to find out something about, between six and ten.

00:21:56.766 --> 00:22:04.306
You see something like that? Something. You can. I mean, if you are on the lookout you can easily find out - no problem.[UNCLEAR]

00:22:06.586 --> 00:22:11.446
- Hamilton - very far away?
- Ah.. no Mother, it is just across the river.

00:22:11.666 --> 00:22:16.886
- That's where
- You know, I listened you out. I think, I can get you on a 845 plane out of Auckland

00:22:17.086 --> 00:22:22.626
- Oh, that's very good!
- which will get You in early in the, You know, mid-morning.
- Yes, that's alright! That's very good.

00:22:23.966 --> 00:22:30.746
- This is where all the very rich people live.[UNCLEAR]
- Is it? But you can live there - why not? [UNCLEAR - YOU ARE NO LESS?]

00:22:31.006 --> 00:22:38.766
- It's on the way to the airport, Mother; It's very nice.
- It's a very big block of land
- Let's see, let's see
- Half acre.

00:22:41.866 --> 00:22:49.586
- See it's very good is the area is, square meter is not much. Two thousand - two thousand is not much
- Less than half an acre.

00:22:50.306 --> 00:22:57.326
- Oh, I see - is the area
- Yes.
- What is it? How much you have here?

00:23:00.246 --> 00:23:05.066
- Four bedrooms.
- Won't work out
- Yes Mother.

00:23:07.866 --> 00:23:13.926
- Need not go to a place which has got few this things but this is very far away, you said.

00:23:14.286 --> 00:23:17.326
- Yes Mother - 800 kilometers
- Hmm.

00:23:20.086 --> 00:23:26.026
You have to find out, I mean, I don't know where - which is the closer and which is not but, you see, there're so many

00:23:26.226 --> 00:23:32.526
every Saturday. Just go through them and see for yourself whatever you like. These are all for

00:23:32.906 --> 00:23:38.906
- uh.. this is all for auctions, I think.
- Yes.
- Why do they auction it?

00:23:40.166 --> 00:23:44.926
- The more expensive ones will be auctioned.
- Oh!
- So the agents make more money.

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:11.046
This, this kind of thing you should see always because you can renovate them and they are better houses always.

00:24:16.506 --> 00:24:23.146
- And I don't know which place is - what is this one is?
- This is [UNCLEAR], this is across the river

00:24:24.426 --> 00:24:30.546
- but that is 5 kilometers from here
- Hmm
- It's again a very expensive area

00:24:30.746 --> 00:24:37.346
Unnh. It will be, it is [ UNCLEAR] in the, it will be. You should try to make it a

00:24:38.446 --> 00:24:46.306
little out; Also good for children. You see, the atmosphere in the city is not so good for their lungs and things - it's also difficult

00:24:53.586 --> 00:24:56.606
Where is Cashmere Place?

00:25:02.346 --> 00:25:07.586
- I don't know that one, Mother.
- It is not so expensive.

00:25:08.786 --> 00:25:13.506
- The houses don't seem to be very expensive here, I don't see
- This is the cheapest place in Australia

00:25:13.726 --> 00:25:17.386
- Which one?
- Brisbane is cheapest place in Australia.
- Then you should, you should have, then why not?

00:25:25.566 --> 00:25:28.706
Very cheap!

00:25:42.966 --> 00:25:47.986
Here they have not written how much [UNCLEAR]

00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:53.346
- Three bedroom
- Three bedroom
- [UNCLEAR]

00:25:57.986 --> 00:26:00.926
You can find out.

00:26:03.966 --> 00:26:09.086
Children should be out. I don't like them to stay in the cities - it's not good.

00:26:09.326 --> 00:26:12.366
They get all the bad things of the city only

00:26:13.326 --> 00:26:19.826
- Here lots of nice places are near the
- [UNCLEAR]
- near the ocean.
- [UNCLEAR - YEAH?]

00:27:15.346 --> 00:27:19.626
It's quite good; I don't know how many bedrooms [UNCLEAR]

00:27:20.586 --> 00:27:25.926
- Three bedrooms [UNCLEAR]
- Three bedrooms and study

00:27:29.746 --> 00:27:37.706
- You will find out - it's not difficult. If it's for renovation, it will be cheaper and we all can renovate it, you see.
- Yes, Mother.

00:27:46.326 --> 00:27:52.546
It's simple. You should sit down nicely with about five, six newspapers

00:27:52.766 --> 00:27:56.546
and give it to everyone. Let them sit down and find out for themselves

00:27:56.746 --> 00:28:02.246
[UNCLEAR] and if it is for renovation, nothing like it because then you can renovate it the way you like

00:28:03.066 --> 00:28:06.706
- and lots of things you can do with it
- and get together to do the work

00:28:06.926 --> 00:28:12.106
- Yes, that's a very good idea.
- Yeah
- When you live there, [UNCLEAR] renovating it also

00:28:14.826 --> 00:28:20.446
Better now? Little ice has cured you - just imagine.

00:28:21.286 --> 00:28:27.126
Doctors will not tell you what is - virus, this, that all kinds of stories.

00:28:27.786 --> 00:28:33.766
Then I take your leave now, I leave it to you people. Sit down properly and just find out

00:28:34.146 --> 00:28:38.526
because making it will be difficult. You are getting them so cheap just now, maybe,

00:28:38.826 --> 00:28:43.776
that the prices are low - why not buy one? Then we'll see about it later.

00:28:47.126 --> 00:28:50.186
Alright, may God bless you!

00:28:52.486 --> 00:28:58.466
- This chair is a rocking chair.
- You want [UNCLEAR]
