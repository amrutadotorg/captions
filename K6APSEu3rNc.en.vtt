WEBVTT

00:00:32.094 --> 00:00:39.324
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:00:42.675 --> 00:00:51.175
I've said this many times that Truth
is what it is. You can't change it,

00:00:51.184 --> 00:01:01.614
you cannot define it, and you cannot
describe it also.

00:01:05.523 --> 00:01:19.523
Especially in Maharashtra, there have
been many saints and sages, very
high-class people in Maharashtra.

00:01:19.545 --> 00:01:27.345
There is no doubt in this. And no other
country has had so many saints and sages.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:41.309
But what My experience of Maharashtra is,
that is not so good.

00:01:43.825 --> 00:01:53.515
Have worked very hard in Maharashtra because
this is a land specially created by God.

00:01:53.613 --> 00:02:05.373
Here resides the kingdom of the Ashtavinayaka,
and the three goddesses Mahakali, Mahalakshmi,
and Mahasaraswati are established here.

00:02:05.373 --> 00:02:13.869
Despite all this, Maharashtra's identity
seemed somewhat strange to Me.

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:19.209
Am unable to understand it's wisdom.

00:02:20.772 --> 00:02:35.802
Like Delhi, Ghaziabad, or say Haryana,
Faridabad, Lucknow, Banaras

00:02:35.911 --> 00:02:42.831
I don't understand how the people
there settled in so easily and
why they did so, so quickly.

00:02:42.831 --> 00:02:49.280
No arguments, no questions asked,
just came into Sahaj and settled
in very well.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:55.002
I had no hope at all in a place like
Lucknow, where people live to eat,
drink, and be merry.

00:02:55.021 --> 00:03:01.431
My in-laws live in Lucknow, and I'm
surprised that in the first time
more people than this

00:03:01.478 --> 00:03:04.898
gathered in Lucknow and Muslims
came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:08.182 --> 00:03:11.702
Why doesn't the same happen in Maharashtra?

00:03:12.446 --> 00:03:21.766
It's epithet could be that we have
adopted many gurus here.

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:25.519
Have kept volumes of books, volumes.

00:03:25.744 --> 00:03:30.764
I met a boy on the airplane, he said to Me,
"Mother, please give me my awakening."

00:03:32.145 --> 00:03:36.615
So his Kundalini was just not rising.
I asked, "What happened?"

00:03:36.735 --> 00:03:42.865
"Mother, I get up early in the morning,
take a bath at four o'clock, and read
repeatedly."

00:03:42.931 --> 00:03:48.741
Meaning, I read it again and again. "What?"
"The book, a baba gave me the book."

00:03:49.485 --> 00:03:59.328
"What did this Babaji do?" Said, "He
found the idol of Shri Ram and Sita."

00:03:59.584 --> 00:04:05.634
"Where?" "Where he had said, there."
I said, "He must have buried it
and taken it out."

00:04:05.826 --> 00:04:09.766
"Why don't you think like this? You're
spending your life for that."

00:04:09.766 --> 00:04:12.059
Started saying, "Not only me,
my parents too."

00:04:14.593 --> 00:04:21.223
Then another one came, he said that,
"No, I have a Guru, he is the real
Guru, this, that."

00:04:21.855 --> 00:04:27.965
There have been so many great gurus
here, who should be called real gurus,
who are the real stuff (UNCLEAR).

00:04:28.202 --> 00:04:32.852
They are on one side, and these
people who have come are the
money-grubbing people.

00:04:33.477 --> 00:04:36.617
I think some people went into politics.

00:04:37.858 --> 00:04:43.108
And the remaining few of them,
they are befooling people.

00:04:43.108 --> 00:04:50.833
And people are getting badly misled in it.
For example, Shri Gyaneshwar ji.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:56.121
Such a great soul, O my, just don't ask
anything, as if He is some incarnation,

00:04:56.714 --> 00:05:02.504
was born in this land of Maharashtra,
and the condition we brought him to,

00:05:03.475 --> 00:05:07.005
the same irony we are doing to our
religion here today.

00:05:07.028 --> 00:05:12.638
I want to say this clearly today because
My experience has been something else.

00:05:12.902 --> 00:05:18.532
How we mocked at him; He did not have
slippers to wear on his feet.

00:05:19.134 --> 00:05:21.604
And a palanquin is taken out in his name.

00:05:21.604 --> 00:05:28.770
Just tell, a palanquin is taken out for
the man whose feet were covered with
boils due to walking in the heat.

00:05:29.282 --> 00:05:36.872
And the village in which that palanquin
went, the village, means food and drink
for everyone. Just eating and drinking.

00:05:37.024 --> 00:05:43.934
Food and drink are being distributed in
the name of the man who was deprived of
food and water, whose sister was starving.

00:05:43.934 --> 00:05:47.440
And it's very great(fantastic) - the
competition in it.

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.150
That if they did such a huge guest
feast, I will do such an elaborate feast.

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.026
I have been to each and every
village here.

00:05:55.026 --> 00:06:00.734
But I was very surprised. Secondly,
another sect(Varkari) emerged.

00:06:01.082 --> 00:06:05.172
What is that? Madness? Where did He write

00:06:05.172 --> 00:06:11.042
that you people wear jute clothes,
clothes of wood, and in Marathi,
taal kutak,

00:06:11.542 --> 00:06:18.082
you go there on foot for a month,
pounding the rhythm like that.

00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:26.528
And there are those who call themselves
priests, their name itself is Badve,

00:06:26.528 --> 00:06:32.585
meaning badauna, which means 'hitting
hard' in Marathi. They grab someone's
head and break it with a bang.

00:06:32.981 --> 00:06:37.551
Then the man goes mad, and it is
said that he has attained the
Turiya state.

00:06:37.762 --> 00:06:42.712
And this man that is, he just
belongs to God. Just see.

00:06:43.813 --> 00:06:47.263
When I saw a such a few, then I
just couldn't understand.

00:06:47.263 --> 00:06:51.201
I said, "If these people commit such
sinful acts, where will they go?"

00:06:51.434 --> 00:06:54.634
Later on the government took it
over, so what?

00:06:55.519 --> 00:07:04.799
And the third strange thing I saw that
on the head was a whole basil plant
with its soil,

00:07:04.799 --> 00:07:11.575
and its pot, carrying it on their heads,
women walk miles to reach Alandi.0.

00:07:14.071 --> 00:07:18.181
Who told this? Which religion is it in?

00:07:19.809 --> 00:07:27.139
We are bringing a huge stigma to the
great character of Shri Gyandev Ji.

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.656
We commit such stupid things that
there is no limit to them.

00:07:33.374 --> 00:07:39.184
So many great people have been here,
is that why we have become so foolish?

00:07:39.307 --> 00:07:45.027
I am saying this today because My
heart breaks when I see that in
this manner

00:07:45.027 --> 00:07:50.825
we are doing so much filth in the
name of such great, noble souls.

00:07:55.383 --> 00:08:00.533
Another is this Varkari sect that
has emerged. Now thousands of people
are walking long distances,

00:08:00.533 --> 00:08:03.610
but the most amazing thing is that
tobacco is in the mouth.

00:08:04.118 --> 00:08:09.915
With tobacco in their mouths, then
they're going - Where? So, Pandharpur.

00:08:09.915 --> 00:08:12.893
And there are tobacco shops along the way.

00:08:16.162 --> 00:08:22.722
Tobacco is against the Vishuddhi Chakra,
it is against Shri Krishna.

00:08:23.809 --> 00:08:28.189
And now you must be knowing, medically
too, by God's grace,

00:08:28.401 --> 00:08:33.581
it has been confirmed that tobacco
consumption definitely causes cancer.

00:08:35.947 --> 00:08:43.947
Then they say, "We are liberated."
Is this spirituality, is this what
God is all about?

00:08:48.142 --> 00:08:53.732
In the same way, not aware how many
people - there was a gentleman here,
I felt very bad

00:08:53.732 --> 00:09:01.335
that how is he destroying so many
people. Then I went to meet him, so
food was being cooked downstairs.

00:09:01.821 --> 00:09:06.441
The poor Brahmins there were cooking
food. They said,

00:09:06.441 --> 00:09:10.974
"Two have died of pneumonia, and I'm
about to die too." I said, "Why?"

00:09:11.754 --> 00:09:16.564
There's a word in Marathi 'oliteene',
meaning cooking with wet clothes on.

00:09:16.656 --> 00:09:20.586
Then they said, "We cook in wet clothes.
And they're on the fifth floor."

00:09:20.586 --> 00:09:25.690
"There's no lift here, nothing,
we walk up, in Girgaon, and
give them food."

00:09:28.544 --> 00:09:32.274
Does all this behove a monk?

00:09:33.819 --> 00:09:39.119
They call themselves gurus, and look
at their lifestyles, look at their ways,

00:09:39.119 --> 00:09:46.707
then it is understood that these people
are greedy for money, greedy for women
and are of a very low kind.

00:09:49.405 --> 00:09:52.405
And Maharashtrian people are crazy
about them.

00:09:52.405 --> 00:09:57.751
Those living in Maharashtra and along
with them, our people who had come
from UP who have also got spoilt.

00:09:57.751 --> 00:10:04.731
Would have been better had they
stayed there only. Then on one
side is this stupidity.

00:10:09.252 --> 00:10:13.842
If you go to Siddhi Vinayak, you will
see lines after lines, only lines.

00:10:13.842 --> 00:10:17.468
O, what do you want? What do you
ask Vinayak for?

00:10:17.928 --> 00:10:23.898
Going to ask for a job. Is it
Vinayak's work to give you jobs?

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:32.280
What does He give? Should know
what does He give.

00:10:33.064 --> 00:10:38.734
Gives wisdom. No one goes there
to get wisdom.

00:10:40.688 --> 00:10:47.558
Those who approach God for money,
they can never attain Him.

00:10:47.982 --> 00:10:56.342
Peace and comfort of the Spirit, the
bliss of the Spirit, to experience it

00:10:56.342 --> 00:11:01.980
those who will go, are the real
devotees, they are the true seekers.

00:11:03.961 --> 00:11:11.311
And those people who do such useless things,
cannot be called devotion in any way.

00:11:11.311 --> 00:11:17.550
One end is this, and the others here are
those who consider themselves intellectuals.

00:11:19.071 --> 00:11:22.181
Those who consider themselves very intelligent.

00:11:24.231 --> 00:11:33.881
In it are these government servants,
educated poets, writers, etc., etc.,
etc., etc., and many others.

00:11:35.909 --> 00:11:41.629
And besides that, there are people here
who are dedicated to eradicating superstition.

00:11:41.629 --> 00:11:47.696
Those who themselves do not know what
faith is, what will they say,
what will they speak?

00:11:49.882 --> 00:11:56.342
So they're going around in the pursuit
of their intellect. Oh, it's all nonsense,
it's all wrong, it's this, it's that.

00:11:56.877 --> 00:12:05.407
On one side they see these stupidities,
on the other side they follow those
stupidities.

00:12:06.054 --> 00:12:12.674
In the centre of it lies the Truth. It
is to be found in the centre of it.

00:12:13.871 --> 00:12:25.231
If someone reads Gnyaneshwar, I don't
know what glasses they put on or
they don't understand.

00:12:26.637 --> 00:12:36.667
Namdev has said that even a single line
of Gyaneshwar, you should experience.

00:12:37.452 --> 00:12:47.252
It's a matter of experience. Without
experience, that which is devoid of
experience, is not the Truth.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.640
Today I will tell you about Gyaneshwar.

00:12:53.817 --> 00:13:01.677
He must have said this, I think, for
all the over-intelligent people of
that time.

00:13:01.866 --> 00:13:09.236
Must have explained something. The kind
of similes, the kind of examples He
used to give.

00:13:09.554 --> 00:13:17.294
Those examples are so amazing that
what should I tell. As an example,
He said,

00:13:17.870 --> 00:13:25.500
that there is a very beautiful picture,
and in this picture, it is raining and
flowers have bloomed

00:13:25.790 --> 00:13:31.559
and alongside it the river flows,

00:13:31.599 --> 00:13:40.379
there are birds and mountains, a very
beautiful picture has been created
and we are looking at that picture.

00:13:40.379 --> 00:13:44.789
Just looking at the picture. And
that becomes an external thing.

00:13:45.029 --> 00:13:48.380
It is just a picture, we are
looking at it from the outside.

00:13:48.571 --> 00:13:57.321
But if we want to experience the
joy of that picture, then we have
to enter into that picture.

00:13:58.246 --> 00:14:02.616
Because the joy that we are getting
from this intellect, that is not
the complete joy.

00:14:02.616 --> 00:14:09.753
Have to enter into it. You have to
subtly penetrate into it and
experience it.

00:14:09.753 --> 00:14:14.712
Only then will the showers fall upon
us, only then will we be overwhelmed
with joy.

00:14:14.736 --> 00:14:21.516
Has said so many beautiful things.
Such beautiful things have been said,
but no one understands.

00:14:21.516 --> 00:14:26.393
Just keep chanting it since morning.
They say, "I have memorized the
Gyaneshwari." Is it done?

00:14:26.663 --> 00:14:33.453
O! Someone should understand its
meaning, understand the meaning of
what is said.

00:14:34.263 --> 00:14:42.143
What he has described is, that a
person who has attained such a high
state, what would he be like.

00:14:42.143 --> 00:14:45.789
That too is also very beautiful,
is extremely beautiful.

00:14:45.789 --> 00:14:57.710
In it He's said, 'The moon does not
seek its own moonlight' - see how
poetic it is.

00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:04.760
The moon does not look for its
moonlight, the sun does not
look for its rays.

00:15:04.954 --> 00:15:10.304
Shines as long as it has to, and then
it absorbs its rays within itself.

00:15:10.724 --> 00:15:15.844
It doesn't have to see whether
it has done any work or not.

00:15:15.844 --> 00:15:21.514
The power that is within it is in action;
It watches it passively.

00:15:21.698 --> 00:15:28.128
It doesn't realize it within
itself that he did it.

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.090
It doesn't feel that I did this work.

00:15:35.776 --> 00:15:44.256
If you read Him, you will understand
that it is important to experience it.

00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:52.020
Spirituality is not something that
is to be read, it is a thing to
be absorbed within.

00:15:52.279 --> 00:15:58.799
It's something to experience inside.
I've been saying the same thing
since the beginning.

00:15:58.799 --> 00:16:04.858
But today I feel that we have
also set off Gyandevji.

00:16:04.858 --> 00:16:10.639
I just went to a conference, there
were major controversies there.

00:16:10.673 --> 00:16:16.853
Someone said that, "Our religion is good,
someone said our religion is good,
someone says our religion is good."

00:16:16.853 --> 00:16:20.196
No one was listening to what they
were saying, they kept on muttering
one after the other.

00:16:20.196 --> 00:16:25.986
Anyway, I wasn't there at the time - luck.
I came right in the end and spoke.

00:16:27.227 --> 00:16:34.977
So I said that, "If there is no
religion within, then the external
religion has no meaning."

00:16:35.122 --> 00:16:42.173
You only tell Me, if someone is a
Hindu, a Muslim, a Christian,
a Sikh, or else he's a Jain,

00:16:42.173 --> 00:16:48.063
otherwise, someone else, is a Buddhist
or something else – is there any
restriction on him of his religion?

00:16:50.813 --> 00:17:00.493
If supposing a Jain becomes a politician,
then will he not take money because
he's a Jain?

00:17:05.826 --> 00:17:13.576
If a Hindu boasts of being a Hindu
and if he gets money, then won't
he sell his country?

00:17:17.583 --> 00:17:26.303
Where is the religion? Religion is
within, within us, something
that resides within.

00:17:26.411 --> 00:17:33.651
Dharma means that in every moment
of your life, even in subtle ways,

00:17:33.651 --> 00:17:43.144
you cannot commit unrighteousness, just
cannot. You must attain that righteousness,
not the external righteousness.

00:17:43.172 --> 00:17:48.512
Then I said that so many external
religions have been created,
just to create conflict.

00:17:48.573 --> 00:17:55.903
Don't know, thousands of Muslims are
dying, thousands of Hindus are dying,
Christians are dying.

00:17:55.903 --> 00:18:05.439
Everyone is dying in the name
of God. Could this even be a
thing? Think about it.

00:18:05.439 --> 00:18:12.343
You are very intelligent people of
Bombay, just think that, can you
fight for religion?

00:18:13.514 --> 00:18:19.264
And even those who (lead to) protect religion,
are they really very religious?

00:18:28.873 --> 00:18:42.353
So I said this that, 'Sir,' I said
this in Rome, I said that,
'Religion is only one.'

00:18:42.807 --> 00:18:52.517
The religion of the world should be
pure and settled within; There should
not be any blackness in it.

00:18:53.186 --> 00:19:02.086
That world religion should be established.
So the Catholic Church members there,
they became very nervous.

00:19:02.086 --> 00:19:06.983
They said that, "We don't want
this world religion. We want
separate-separate religions."

00:19:06.983 --> 00:19:13.928
Catholics should be separate, Protestants
should be separate, and similarly,
every religion should be separate.

00:19:16.282 --> 00:19:23.322
I said, "What for? To fight amongst yourselves?
Why do you want separate-separate religions?"

00:19:23.322 --> 00:19:25.927
"Otherwise, with what excuse would you fight?"

00:19:25.927 --> 00:19:31.561
If there is one religion in the
whole world, then how will you fight?

00:19:32.573 --> 00:19:37.193
And that too a religion that has
been awakened within you.

00:19:38.092 --> 00:19:43.982
Without the awakening of that
religion, nothing can be alright.

00:19:43.982 --> 00:19:52.429
If you say, "We want peace," then perform
a yagya for peace, do this, do that,
nothing is going to happen with it.

00:19:52.429 --> 00:19:59.592
This world cannot be set right without
complete transformation of man.

00:20:01.638 --> 00:20:08.498
And this time of today, is special.
I call it 'blossom time.'

00:20:08.653 --> 00:20:16.973
This is the time which is called
'The Last Judgment', which is called
'Qiyama' in the Quran.

00:20:17.010 --> 00:20:22.830
And we also consider this a time
of great transition.

00:20:22.830 --> 00:20:30.298
Many speeches have been made on this,
since times immemorial. Not only this,
there have been on future too.

00:20:30.621 --> 00:20:34.971
This is a special time, and this work
is possible only in this Kaliyuga.

00:20:34.971 --> 00:20:45.820
Where thousands of people, who were
searching for the Truth in the mounts
and caves, will find it.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:57.049
This is the time, meaning a special time,
you are special people, and you are the
only ones who deserve it.

00:20:57.049 --> 00:20:59.929
And you should receive this.

00:20:59.929 --> 00:21:05.683
But now if someone is a very big officer,
so his head is spoilt, why would he do
such things?

00:21:05.795 --> 00:21:16.335
If there's someone else, they're a big
name in music, should say they're famous,
why would they bother their heads?

00:21:16.335 --> 00:21:21.112
There're third ones, they're making
a lot of money, so why would they
bother their heads?

00:21:22.083 --> 00:21:32.773
And then when with all those things
trouble comes upon you, misfortune
comes upon you, then you tend to
look to that side.

00:21:32.895 --> 00:21:37.825
For example, someone was telling Me that,
there is a complete recession these days.

00:21:37.825 --> 00:21:45.165
There's no money at all. So, you've
built such a big economy, then why has
this condition come, why did it happen?

00:21:45.165 --> 00:21:52.206
What's the matter? There's no religion
in it. And that too the religion
that's within us.

00:21:54.944 --> 00:22:04.844
As soon as that Dharma awakens, the
first thing that happens to a person
is that he becomes immersed in peace.

00:22:05.685 --> 00:22:15.535
His life becomes as blissful as the
waves of joy in an ocean of peace.

00:22:16.632 --> 00:22:22.332
And for that, there is no need to go
to Pandharpur, no need to go to Dwarka,

00:22:22.332 --> 00:22:25.835
there is no need to go anywhere,
it is within ourselves only.

00:22:34.510 --> 00:22:39.660
Yes. Now there's a lot of work
going on abroad.

00:22:40.460 --> 00:22:47.000
In Russia, four times as many people
as you, attend each program — just
believe this thing.

00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.671
There's always a program at the stadium.
Now, why do those Russians come, sir?

00:22:55.170 --> 00:23:00.330
They ask that, "Mother, why are You so
kind to the Russians?" I don't have any
special kindness.

00:23:01.391 --> 00:23:10.806
But why do they come? Because of the
disasters, the hardships, the
calamities of communism,

00:23:10.806 --> 00:23:14.661
they have borne a lot. They've got
upset with it.

00:23:17.030 --> 00:23:26.000
And on the other hand, they don't
have any kind of impressions that
you are Hindu or a Muslim,

00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.809
that you're a Christian, that you're
this, that you're like this, that
you're like that, nothing.

00:23:30.133 --> 00:23:35.183
As we say absolutely clean slates,
such perfectly clean people.

00:23:36.209 --> 00:23:41.633
They came like this in Sahaja Yoga
and just settled down. In Maharashtra
this is definitely the case,

00:23:41.633 --> 00:23:52.122
in Maharashtra, you will get your
realization, that happens in a moment,
because the land is so great.

00:23:52.122 --> 00:23:56.762
Your past virtues are very great, that
is why you were born in this land.

00:23:56.762 --> 00:24:02.214
A man is born in the land of Maharashtra
after countless virtuous deeds.

00:24:02.214 --> 00:24:10.844
I wonder how many virtues he has earned
and because of which he was born here.

00:24:11.761 --> 00:24:20.621
Now the state of that virtue is such
that man has forgotten everything and
keeps doing God knows what.

00:24:23.065 --> 00:24:37.125
Such is not the case there. Russian people are
straight forward, simple, supressed, downtrodden,
and they don't understand money that much.

00:24:44.105 --> 00:24:52.975
Their government said to them - are you
able to hear there? What are they saying?

00:24:53.353 --> 00:24:57.363
[MARATHI]

00:24:57.503 --> 00:25:02.846
[MARATHI]

00:25:03.435 --> 00:25:13.055
[MARATHI]

00:25:21.427 --> 00:25:29.167
But there is a dharma towards the nation also.
That is religion, it should be understood.

00:25:31.289 --> 00:25:45.409
Those who have entered politics, should
remember that we have to earn name — not money.

00:25:45.409 --> 00:25:51.185
If you want to earn money, go into business.
You're there to make a name for yourself.

00:25:51.185 --> 00:25:56.649
Even today, if you mention the name of
Shastriji, Lal Bahadur Shastriji,
people bow down in respect.

00:25:57.084 --> 00:26:01.354
Did he earn money – name, he earned
a name.

00:26:01.864 --> 00:26:08.644
The same is true of government jobs;
that those who are government servants,
they too earn a name.

00:26:09.195 --> 00:26:15.045
Recently we were coming by plane, and
there were a couple of very important
government officials sitting there.

00:26:15.122 --> 00:26:19.202
As soon as they saw us, they turned
their faces away. The reason was that they -

00:26:21.292 --> 00:26:27.422
What is it? (UNCLEAR) What do they do?
What should I call them?

00:26:27.422 --> 00:26:33.808
Yes, hawala, hawala. They were
caught in hawala.

00:26:36.675 --> 00:26:41.302
And those poor guys were so ashamed —
- what can I say to them now, they
were caught in the hawala.

00:26:41.992 --> 00:26:49.992
I agree that the life of a government
employee is also very sad. We were,
we were ourselves.

00:26:50.092 --> 00:26:57.242
Life was very difficult. Never mind.
You are doing the work of the country.

00:26:57.252 --> 00:27:05.452
What a big thing it is! And not only
that, you are improving the country,
helping the country.

00:27:05.554 --> 00:27:09.294
What more can you do than this?

00:27:09.524 --> 00:27:16.763
And what other greater title can you
get, that you are a patriot?

00:27:17.563 --> 00:27:25.163
Whoever has attained the title of
patriotism, it's as if that he has
already gone half to Heaven.

00:27:25.764 --> 00:27:32.324
And it is useless to talk about
religion and spirituality with
someone who has no patriotism.

00:27:32.324 --> 00:27:35.474
Nothing can happen without patriotism.

00:27:41.701 --> 00:27:53.241
Now, the Kundalini that is within us -
is within all of you. This is nothing new.

00:27:53.423 --> 00:28:03.463
Thousands of years ago, in this very Maharashtra,
Markandeya Swami said, "There is a power called
Kundalini, which must be awakened."

00:28:04.424 --> 00:28:10.404
It is true that the Kundalini Shakti
is within us; it should be awakened.

00:28:10.404 --> 00:28:18.759
Just as a seed sprouts, so too the
Kundalini within man germinates.

00:28:18.798 --> 00:28:26.738
And it gives you oneness with this
All-pervading Power, the Power of
Love of God.

00:28:28.212 --> 00:28:33.072
It happens. You don't have to do
anything about it.

00:28:33.968 --> 00:28:43.158
Kundalini is your own Mother. Your
own, separate, individual Mother.

00:28:43.845 --> 00:28:50.295
She is eager to give you your birth
again, She knows everything about you.

00:28:50.295 --> 00:28:55.584
And with great love She wants
that you attain this second birth.

00:28:55.584 --> 00:29:02.366
Now it is written in all religions
that you must have a second birth.
Which religion is it that does not
have this written?

00:29:02.429 --> 00:29:08.229
But if you only walk around with
the words written on your forehead
that, "I have known the Brahm",

00:29:08.595 --> 00:29:16.435
Meaning what? Or if you said,
"I'm twice-born," so what?"

00:29:16.635 --> 00:29:23.215
If you go around putting up such
advertisements, what solution
will you get from them?

00:29:25.593 --> 00:29:32.253
So when this Kundalini awakens, then
it passes through these six chakras.

00:29:33.787 --> 00:29:45.577
And these six chakras are the source
of your physical, mental, intellectual
and spiritual power.

00:29:47.146 --> 00:29:57.616
And when they are nourished, due to
that within you your physical,
mental, intellectual,

00:29:57.691 --> 00:30:03.211
whatever problems there are, and
spiritual ones, they all get resolved.

00:30:04.463 --> 00:30:09.273
Now, earlier no one believed that
diseases could be cured through
Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:09.273 --> 00:30:13.392
Now that some of the doctors have
been cured, so they have come to
their senses.

00:30:13.800 --> 00:30:20.020
Now we've opened a hospital. People
are coming there too, and work is
being done.

00:30:20.020 --> 00:30:25.610
Because doctors charge so much these
days, so people say, "Let's go in this,"

00:30:25.610 --> 00:30:34.188
"It doesn't cost much money, it's cheap,
so let's do it." But this is something else.

00:30:35.170 --> 00:30:43.440
How much money would you pay to buy it?
How much wealth do you have?

00:30:45.088 --> 00:30:54.688
Can you purchase your mother?
People here even sell God,
there are such crazy people.

00:30:54.927 --> 00:30:57.308
But this is your mother.

00:30:57.308 --> 00:31:02.560
At least in our country India, no
one talks about selling mothers.

00:31:03.086 --> 00:31:11.026
Those who take money in the name of Kundalini
awakening are selling their own mother.

00:31:15.834 --> 00:31:27.264
What money would you give it? It's
so built up from within, internally

00:31:27.264 --> 00:31:32.504
that it wants that her son may
somehow get his rebirth,

00:31:32.504 --> 00:31:40.271
all his wanderings end. And surprisingly,
when this union occurs,

00:31:40.486 --> 00:31:46.266
oneness with this All-pervading power
of the Divine occurs,

00:31:46.503 --> 00:31:54.183
so surprisingly, all of a sudden, all
the bad qualities that we have,
they all fall down.

00:31:54.283 --> 00:31:59.293
They don't exist at all. It's as if
a lotus flower has bloomed

00:31:59.996 --> 00:32:04.596
and it has made the entire lake fragrant.

00:32:04.596 --> 00:32:14.291
One better than the other, such lotus
flowers bloom, although you have changed
the name of Bombay to Mumbai,

00:32:14.694 --> 00:32:19.194
but how many disciples of Mumba Aai(Mother)
are there here, that is for Me to see.

00:32:20.293 --> 00:32:27.873
What will changing the name do? Changing
the name will not make Mumba-aai.

00:32:29.048 --> 00:32:35.068
This very Mumba-aai is the Kundalini,
and until it is awakened within you,

00:32:35.068 --> 00:32:38.203
You are absolutely useless people
living in Mumbai.

00:32:38.972 --> 00:32:45.372
Not only that, that awakening is done.
As soon as awakening is done, it will
bring complete peace within.

00:32:46.496 --> 00:32:51.776
Then man becomes a witness and watches
the entire drama of the world.

00:32:53.834 --> 00:32:59.634
An impressive personality comes into him.

00:32:59.634 --> 00:33:04.262
I am surprised when people were awakened,
after that they said,

00:33:04.262 --> 00:33:09.966
"Mother, we have been very, and due to
Kundalini, we have benefited greatly."

00:33:09.966 --> 00:33:13.832
"Our boys have become good at studies,
such and such has happened, various
things have happened."

00:33:13.832 --> 00:33:20.884
Well, has to be, because you have
entered the kingdom of God.

00:33:21.184 --> 00:33:26.765
And all the powers of God are
affecting you inside.

00:33:26.765 --> 00:33:34.048
Not only this, but they protect you
completely.

00:33:34.138 --> 00:33:41.228
This All-pervading power protects
you completely.

00:33:41.642 --> 00:33:45.742
And now people have even started saying,
those who have got their realization, that,

00:33:45.742 --> 00:33:49.322
"Mother, now we don't have worry about
anything anymore."

00:33:50.252 --> 00:33:54.481
"Such arrangements are made for us
that am not able to understand."

00:33:56.285 --> 00:34:07.135
And these things should happen greatest in
Maharashtra, because Maharashtra is the
place of all faith(reverence).

00:34:07.626 --> 00:34:20.236
I took birth here because it is a place
of reverence. It was Maharashtra then;
it isn't now, but it was.

00:34:22.576 --> 00:34:31.996
Even after doing all this, I still see
that you're realized, have found peace,
found resolution,

00:34:32.221 --> 00:34:42.938
health has improved, cancer has been cured,
this has happened, that has happened, but
then to, are unable to go deep into Sahaja.

00:34:43.325 --> 00:34:47.915
Unless you go deep into Sahaja,
there'll be no enjoyment.

00:34:50.249 --> 00:34:57.019
In Marathi it is said 'semi-circle',
you will become like that.

00:34:57.019 --> 00:35:03.776
There'll be no enjoyment in it.
And without it, what is left?

00:35:03.873 --> 00:35:11.793
We do everything to have fun. We go to
the cinema because we enjoy it.

00:35:12.497 --> 00:35:17.637
Anything we see, anywhere we go,
roam about, we do for enjoyment

00:35:17.637 --> 00:35:22.515
And what to say of this fun! It's like
immersing yourself in an ocean of bliss.

00:35:22.663 --> 00:35:35.853
But you have to immerse yourself completely
in it. And when this happens, there is
no complaint left.

00:35:36.107 --> 00:35:43.417
Otherwise this that, "My father is not
well, my mother is not well, I don't
have a job, I can't get married."

00:35:43.417 --> 00:35:49.352
I receive such letters, filled up to
here, especially from Maharashtra.

00:35:54.134 --> 00:36:03.194
O people, now you have come to the
kingdom of God, come and sit comfortably,
see what glory you have.

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:10.366
How you've been kept with such magnificence!
Instead, you're half here, half there, half
here, half there, wobbling here and there.

00:36:10.965 --> 00:36:19.875
Don't delve into the depths, and don't
come to the collective, and as soon as
you do, start quarreling, talking,

00:36:19.875 --> 00:36:26.871
talking about money, this, that's why till
date, no Sahaja Yogi, or non-Sahaja Yogi,

00:36:26.871 --> 00:36:34.859
has given Me a single penny. You'll
be surprised. Not a single penny.

00:36:34.859 --> 00:36:39.432
Anyone who has ever given Me a penny
should come and stand – to Me.

00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:47.306
And certainly for the work of Sahaja Yoga;
now, for example, this hall etc has been
taken, its show, this has been taken.

00:36:47.306 --> 00:36:52.288
Money might have been collected for this
—I don't take a look at it, don't see,
don't know.

00:36:57.590 --> 00:37:09.630
But wrong(messy) murmuring will start,
topics will be raised. Is Sahaja Yoga
going to work like this?

00:37:10.618 --> 00:37:17.938
Yes! "A little bit," they said,
"Mother, speak in Marathi." So I'll
speak a little bit of Marathi.

00:37:22.582 --> 00:37:27.742
[TALK IN MARATHI TILL 1:02:22]

01:02:23.014 --> 01:02:29.324
There are three things that need
to be understood.

01:02:31.340 --> 01:02:36.600
First thing I told you earlier, that
no one can be forced.

01:02:36.918 --> 01:02:43.328
If you don't want it, then you go
away, but I can't force you.

01:02:43.766 --> 01:02:50.216
You only tell Me, when you want to
germinate a seed, can you use force
on the seed - no.

01:02:50.766 --> 01:02:59.791
When you put the seed into the womb
of the mother, by itself the seed
sprouts spontaneously.

01:02:59.791 --> 01:03:09.081
Because the power is in the seed,
and mother too has the power.
Power is in you, and it is in Me too.

01:03:09.476 --> 01:03:15.446
With this in mind, understand this
that force cannot be used.

01:03:15.545 --> 01:03:25.065
The second thing is that you people
have come from many places, you have
come after meeting many people,

01:03:25.663 --> 01:03:31.240
belong to different religions, maybe
you might be thinking,

01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.615
"O, we are very sinful people, how
can we get realization? It is a
very difficult thing."

01:03:35.615 --> 01:03:39.597
Many people tell Me, "This is very difficult,
Mother. This is very difficult."

01:03:41.538 --> 01:03:49.458
I say it's not difficult at all, but that
certainly is difficult to tell you,
with folded hands,

01:03:49.588 --> 01:03:52.978
that you should not treat yourself as guilty.

01:03:53.411 --> 01:03:59.471
Don't think. Someone might have said,
"You're a sinner, this, that," —
all that is nonsense.

01:03:59.512 --> 01:04:03.232
Children can never be sinners in
front of their Mother.

01:04:03.705 --> 01:04:13.885
At this moment, all of you should forget
whatever was your past, whatever mistakes
you have made, forgetting everything,

01:04:13.885 --> 01:04:18.041
forgive yourself first – first of all.

01:04:19.427 --> 01:04:25.127
As we say in English that, please say,
"I'm not guilty at all."

01:04:26.554 --> 01:04:30.884
Had you been guilty, wouldn't you
be in jail now - how would you have
come here?

01:04:32.879 --> 01:04:36.419
Therefore, we will not take the
blame for anything upon us.

01:04:36.419 --> 01:04:40.605
Would have been better if we had
done this, or that – all these are
wrong things.

01:04:41.991 --> 01:04:50.491
There is no fault in you in my eyes.
Therefore, forgive yourself - first thing.

01:04:52.105 --> 01:04:58.765
Now, secondly, you forgive everyone
altogether.

01:04:59.048 --> 01:05:06.398
This means that you should not even think
about the person you have to forgive.

01:05:06.819 --> 01:05:16.859
Because anyways headache was there, and
the person who was bothering you is happy,
and you are feeling troubled.

01:05:17.171 --> 01:05:26.711
But you please, wholeheartedly, all together,
without thinking of them individually,

01:05:26.711 --> 01:05:33.482
say altogether, "I have forgiven everyone."
Now people will say this too is very difficult.

01:05:34.161 --> 01:05:41.551
It's the easiest because whether you
forgive someone or not, you don't
do anything.

01:05:42.817 --> 01:05:53.807
But if you forgive, then you don't
play into the wrong hands.

01:05:56.021 --> 01:06:08.361
You should forgive everyone completely.
And the third thing is this,

01:06:09.007 --> 01:06:19.007
that is, know this, have faith, that
all of you are going to have
self-realization today.

01:06:21.416 --> 01:06:28.746
Don't have any doubts about yourself
- have complete faith in this.

01:06:33.877 --> 01:06:43.027
If those sitting on chairs take off their
shoes, and the rest of the people take off
their shoes too, that would be good.

01:06:44.747 --> 01:06:51.687
The first time I told the people in
England, "Take off your shoes," half
of them got up and walked away.

01:06:56.105 --> 01:07:06.085
Indians understand this, know quite a
lot, that they should take off their
shoes in any sacred activity.

01:07:06.526 --> 01:07:10.966
Everyone should take off their shoes,
that's all, nothing else.

01:07:26.125 --> 01:07:32.088
And sit comfortably, very composed,

01:07:33.318 --> 01:07:40.268
no one has to stand on their heads,
and go to the Himalayas, and don't
have to do anything else.

01:07:40.695 --> 01:07:46.175
Your own Kundalini is within you and
you will achieve(get) it.

01:07:57.479 --> 01:08:04.509
[MARATHI]

01:08:04.509 --> 01:08:11.213
[MARATHI]

01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:22.810
Okay, whosoever wants to go, go away.

01:08:24.891 --> 01:08:30.061
Now only put both your hands towards Me.
[MARATHI]

01:08:34.605 --> 01:08:44.395
Slightly raised. [MARATHI]
Normally

01:08:48.981 --> 01:08:57.591
One amazing thing is that the people
of Maharashtra [MARATHI]

01:08:57.733 --> 01:09:05.203
[MARATHI]

01:09:06.245 --> 01:09:20.685
Now put your right hand towards Me.
Right hand towards Me.

01:09:20.685 --> 01:09:22.136
[MARATHI]

01:09:22.136 --> 01:09:37.870
And with your head bent, place your
left hand on the palate, which was
a soft bone in childhood.

01:09:38.926 --> 01:09:50.536
[MARATHI]

01:09:50.774 --> 01:09:56.494
Slightly raised, above – shouldn't
touch it, the head.

01:10:04.418 --> 01:10:10.298
Bend your head, bend your head
[MARATHI]

01:10:10.573 --> 01:10:18.833
Please bend your heads, please bend your
heads. Now please take your left hand

01:10:19.895 --> 01:10:22.775
[MARATHI]

01:10:23.295 --> 01:10:35.381
Place your left hand towards Me. Bend
your head again and see. People aren't
doing it properly. Yes!

01:10:36.024 --> 01:10:43.724
Now see whether there is any cool or
warm air coming from your fontanel
bone area.

01:10:44.749 --> 01:10:55.139
[MARATHI]

01:10:55.139 --> 01:10:58.110
See for yourself and certify yourself.

01:10:59.575 --> 01:11:09.525
Yes, now put your right hand towards Me
and bend your neck, see on your
fontanel bone area

01:11:11.829 --> 01:11:19.489
whether a cool or warm breeze is coming
from your head? Bend your head. Yes!

01:11:19.489 --> 01:11:28.370
[MARATHI]

01:11:30.530 --> 01:11:38.270
Hmm! Now again, the left hand again.

01:11:40.224 --> 01:11:53.254
Bend your head and use your right
hand to examine your palate. Is
cool air coming or warm air?

01:11:53.254 --> 01:11:58.128
And now, warm air is coming because
you have not forgiven yourself

01:11:58.128 --> 01:12:04.388
and not forgiven others. That's
why warm air is coming.

01:12:05.961 --> 01:12:11.331
[MARATHI]

01:12:11.331 --> 01:12:17.068
[MARATHI]

01:12:17.430 --> 01:12:27.350
[MARATHI]

01:12:27.350 --> 01:12:34.856
[MARATHI]

01:12:37.298 --> 01:12:46.848
[MARATHI]

01:12:46.848 --> 01:12:56.458
[MARATHI]

01:12:56.458 --> 01:13:04.962
[MARATHI]

01:13:04.976 --> 01:13:11.616
Raise both your hands and bend your
neck backwards to look at the sky

01:13:11.963 --> 01:13:19.143
and ask any one of the three questions
three times.

01:13:20.572 --> 01:13:24.942
You may call Me Mother or Shri Mataji.

01:13:25.122 --> 01:13:29.739
[MARATHI]

01:13:29.739 --> 01:13:40.586
Now the first question, "Shri Mataji,
is this Paramchaitanya?"

01:13:43.563 --> 01:13:50.103
[MARATHI]

01:13:52.570 --> 01:14:03.730
The second question, "Shri Mataji,
is this the Power of Love of God?"

01:14:05.690 --> 01:14:12.120
[MARATHI]

01:14:12.431 --> 01:14:21.411
The third question, third question,
“Is this the Rooh?”

01:14:25.393 --> 01:14:36.013
[MARATHI]

01:14:36.013 --> 01:14:42.566
"Mother, is this what is called the Rooh?"
Ask any of these questions, with your
heart, three times.

01:14:42.624 --> 01:14:50.434
And now bring your hands down. Put
them down. Now both hands towards Me.

01:14:55.748 --> 01:15:06.788
Both hands towards Me. Look at Me and
become thoughtless. Look at Me and
become thoughtless.

01:15:10.989 --> 01:15:17.889
There's no question of mesmerism in this,
because I've closed My eyes.

01:15:19.231 --> 01:15:24.321
People mesmerize with their eyes.
They do strange things.

01:15:24.875 --> 01:15:36.305
Yes, now look. Yes! Become thoughtless.

01:15:36.305 --> 01:15:43.214
Some people might be feeling a cool breeze
coming from under their hands. So they
should lift it up and bring it on top.

01:15:43.214 --> 01:15:50.016
Like this, like this, like this, like this.

01:15:50.375 --> 01:15:58.605
[MARATHI]

01:15:58.605 --> 01:16:02.347
[MARATHI]

01:16:10.894 --> 01:16:17.424
[MARATHI]

01:16:17.424 --> 01:16:23.755
[MARATHI]

01:16:33.054 --> 01:16:47.534
[MARATHI]

01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:54.050
[MARATHI]

01:16:54.050 --> 01:17:00.430
Experience must come
[MARATHI]

01:17:00.430 --> 01:17:09.366
Those, those - [MARATHI]

01:17:09.366 --> 01:17:16.769
Wow! Infinite blessings, infinite
blessings to all!

01:17:17.709 --> 01:17:25.899
Wow! Wow! Wow! Wow! How many people,
look how many people you are!

01:17:25.899 --> 01:17:32.631
If you settle down in Sahaja, you will
set the whole of Maharashtra right.

01:17:34.392 --> 01:17:42.342
Today you have to promise only this
to Mother, "We will settle down, Mother.
From seeds we will grow into trees."

01:17:42.407 --> 01:17:47.487
Just give Me this promise and I don't
want anything else from you.

01:17:47.487 --> 01:17:52.548
So live happily. A Mother wants to share
all Her Powers with Her children.

01:17:52.548 --> 01:18:02.560
Give everything, somehow, after convincing,
to everyone. Eternal blessings to all!

01:18:05.964 --> 01:18:13.564
Now please sit quietly for a while. I
have spoken about Gyandevji's 'Pasaydaan".

01:18:15.819 --> 01:18:20.709
So, someone has come and she will recite.
Its meaning is very beautiful.

01:18:20.827 --> 01:18:33.207
The meaning is that those who are the
speaking oceans, meaning the speaking
group(collective) –

01:18:33.207 --> 01:18:44.071
now all these have come - they walk,
and whoever

01:18:45.115 --> 01:18:58.505
came speaking - that whatever is,
(UNCLEAR) and all these forests,
the forests of 'Kalptaru' -

01:18:58.505 --> 01:19:03.295
All these people, the forests of 'Kalptaru',
have come - they go - it's all like this -

01:19:03.295 --> 01:19:06.699
But the first is, "Give us Pasaydan."
This is Pasaydan(Gift of Divine Grace).

01:19:06.769 --> 01:19:14.899
This is what they have asked for.
"I have seen this through your words,
now please give us your Gift of
Divine Grace(Pasaydaan)."

01:19:14.899 --> 01:19:20.966
Give this, this is the Payasadan.
Okay, now, sit quietly. Now one ...

01:19:26.159 --> 01:19:35.309
[Recitation of Pasaydaan in Marathi]
[Till 1:23:58]

01:24:06.745 --> 01:24:10.875
Sahaja Yogi: It is important that
we try hard and grow in it.

01:24:10.875 --> 01:24:16.223
And may the thoughtlessness that we
have achieved today become fully
established within us.

01:24:16.223 --> 01:24:20.045
For this, it is very important
to meditate collectively

01:24:20.045 --> 01:24:23.206
and for this, it is very important
to come to the centers.

01:24:23.206 --> 01:24:33.948
So, after this the follow-up programs that
are are going to be held on Sunday and
Monday, December 22nd and 23rd,

01:24:33.948 --> 01:24:40.793
at 6 p.m. in the evening, these follow-up
programs will be conducted at six locations
in Bombay.

01:24:40.793 --> 01:24:46.425
Where you please come, please do come.
Those friends and other groups of yours
who couldn't come today,

01:24:46.425 --> 01:24:50.541
bring them along too and share this
experience with them.

01:24:50.541 --> 01:24:54.843
So this pamphlet is being distributed here.

01:24:54.843 --> 01:25:02.358
Before leaving this place, please
take this pamphlet surely with you.

01:25:02.358 --> 01:25:06.698
And these follow-up programs that are,
you must attend them. Jai Shri Mataji!

01:25:06.845 --> 01:25:12.545
Shri Mataji: ....is and sing very well
in Marathi, Hindi and Sanskrit.

01:25:12.885 --> 01:25:16.885
They are our guests, sit down for a while,
what special is there to do?

01:25:17.503 --> 01:25:22.473
It would be nice if you sat down. Sit
for a while. They should also be respected.

01:25:22.925 --> 01:25:25.265
They have come to your land.

01:25:34.628 --> 01:25:41.918
Saaton Janam, then Jogwa – The first song was
composed by these people only, in Hindi.

01:25:42.094 --> 01:25:48.084
And even set the tune, everything
was done by them entirely.

01:25:48.503 --> 01:25:53.983
In that no help from any Indian, nothing.
Made it themselves, the first one.

01:25:54.555 --> 01:26:03.305
And the second song that is, is Namdev's
'Jogwa'. The second one is Namdev's 'Jogwa'.

01:26:03.954 --> 01:26:12.054
So they sing in such a way that if you
listen to them, you won't think they're
not Maharashtrians - very clearly.

01:26:21.437 --> 01:26:30.437
'Saat Janam' bhajan [Till 1:32:40]
