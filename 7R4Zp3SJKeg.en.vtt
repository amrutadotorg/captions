00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:33.999
First we are going to have the “Namaz”.

00:00:34.291 --> 00:00:36.667
We have to learn how to do “Namaz”

00:00:36.917 --> 00:00:39.125
today, because it's a Guru's Day.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:43.250
Now where is...? - Come along!

00:00:43.875 --> 00:00:48.875
All of you who are here should learn how to do “Namaz”.

00:00:49.709 --> 00:00:54.041
Now stand here. Facing Me. Come along!

00:00:54.875 --> 00:01:00.208
G:"I would like that everybody sit down, so that everybody can see."

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.000
No, you have to stand up, because you have to do accordingly.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.999
YOGI: "I was thinking you all stand up and stand in rows.

00:01:12.333 --> 00:01:16.083
You have to leave a space in front of you,

00:01:16.291 --> 00:01:18.917
there has to be a certain space so that you bow down."

00:01:23.375 --> 00:01:25.166
May I have some water to drink.

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:28.291
GREGOIRE: "We should all stand in a circle,

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.542
leaving space between each circle around Shri Mataji,

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:33.208
so that we can bow.

00:01:33.417 --> 00:01:36.458
So everybody stands in three or four circles,

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:42.041
with one meter at least between the two circles."

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.583
Where are you going to have lunch?

00:01:49.625 --> 00:01:51.792
Yogi: We are going to bring it here Mother.

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:55.208
Shri Mataji:All right, that's all right.

00:02:03.625 --> 00:02:07.709
Are you all listening now?

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.250
Shri Mataji: Just move it backwards.

00:02:11.458 --> 00:02:14.333
Y: Mother I will put this over here which will shade you a little.

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:17.458
Shri Mataji: Sorry.

00:02:17.792 --> 00:02:20.375
Yogi:I think I did it a little too far.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.667
Shri Mataji: Its because its coming up, all right,doesen't matter.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:26.792
Yogi:But I'm afraid

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:28.417
Shri Mataji: All right.

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:41.792
Alright, let's - ah?

00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:45.250
Now let's do.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.875
YOGI: "There are supposed to be five different “Namaz” per day,

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.583
and there is one at dawn,

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:56.166
one somewhere when the sun is at the highest point."

00:02:56.375 --> 00:02:57.959
SHRI MATAJI: So that's one you do.  YOGI: "And

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:01.250
there is one about four o'clock and one at dusk

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:03.125
and then there is also one later on

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:05.959
perhaps two or three hours after dusk.

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:09.542
and each one has a certain number, what we call "rak'aht",

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:13.834
is how many times you bow down to the ground, how many times

00:03:14.041 --> 00:03:16.792
and also it has a certain variation

00:03:16.999 --> 00:03:20.542
as to whether you should talk, say the Koran loudly

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:23.083
or whether you should say it within your heart.

00:03:23.291 --> 00:03:25.208
Now we are not going into those details,

00:03:25.417 --> 00:03:27.041
what matters is the essence.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:29.125
So we gonna give, we gonna say four "rak'aht"

00:03:29.333 --> 00:03:32.542
which means we gonna bow down four times and ..."

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.333
SHRI MATAJI: What do you do for the twelve o'clock one?

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:37.917
YOGI: "For the twelve o'clock one we do four."

00:03:38.083 --> 00:03:40.583
SHRI MATAJI: That's alright then. YOGI: "Four and ...

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:44.041
but it develops variations as to whether we should say,

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.625
talk loudly when we say the Koran.

00:03:46.834 --> 00:03:48.792
But I say we say it all loudly,

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:51.583
because I'll be the only one saying it in Arabic.

00:03:51.792 --> 00:03:55.542
And perhaps we can have in future times" - SHRI MATAJI: Translation.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:58.208
YOGI: " we can have it in English

00:03:58.417 --> 00:04:01.250
especially the third account is for the exordium,

00:04:01.458 --> 00:04:07.291
which is the most basic verses of the Koran.

00:04:09.417 --> 00:04:14.417
Basically the exordium is just to say that, Oh God,

00:04:14.667 --> 00:04:18.667
You who are the King of judgment day

00:04:20.417 --> 00:04:21.834
just take me to the right path

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.125
and don't let me fail from the right path, and so on.

00:04:25.333 --> 00:04:29.333
It's something like that, it's one of the most basic prayers."

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.375
SHRI MATAJI:You see towards Mecca when you do it.

00:04:31.583 --> 00:04:33.999
YOGI: "Anyway you will hear me now

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:37.750
we are going to start by calling the prayer."

00:04:39.375 --> 00:04:42.625
GREGOIRE: Should I repeat Mother, because they can't hear?

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.250
SHRI MATAJI: No. GREGOIRE: Should I shout? SHRI MATAJI: No.

00:04:48.333 --> 00:04:53.917
GREGOIRE: We are now going to exert the calling to prayer,

00:04:54.166 --> 00:04:57.375
the call of the prayer is told by Shri Mohammed

00:04:57.625 --> 00:05:03.375
and our brother Djamel has said there are many variations.

00:05:03.875 --> 00:05:09.125
You do it at dawn, at dusk, at noon

00:05:09.792 --> 00:05:12.250
either loudly either...

00:18:22.667 --> 00:18:25.709
May God bless you.

00:20:39.792 --> 00:20:43.333
Now from every center one person can come.

00:20:43.542 --> 00:20:45.709
From every country I should say.

00:20:45.917 --> 00:20:51.250
From every European country one person can come.

00:20:56.083 --> 00:20:59.583
One from Algeria. It's alright it.

00:21:00.250 --> 00:21:04.208
One from France, immediately, immediately. Do it fast!

00:21:14.291 --> 00:21:16.917
Also give them...Yogasie

00:21:24.917 --> 00:21:28.792
Let Yogasie be there from India.

00:21:35.709 --> 00:21:38.500
From all over I hope everybody has come,

00:21:38.750 --> 00:21:41.999
from so many countries, just imagine.

00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:43.917
Start now.

00:22:02.792 --> 00:22:08.542
Keep it here! Alright, alright. Start it!

00:22:14.125 --> 00:22:17.667
First light the lamp.

00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:22.000
First light the lamp, then start.

00:22:22.208 --> 00:22:25.792
Where is the camphor?

00:22:28.083 --> 00:22:31.625
Start it.

00:22:31.917 --> 00:22:33.667
When you start saying...

00:22:33.875 --> 00:22:37.250
Are they very long?

00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:42.542
I am saying this because full moon night will finish.

00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:48.125
Start soon. Must start now! Getting late.

00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:52.750
Purnima should not finish, before that must start.

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:56.166
Ha. Start.

00:23:04.041 --> 00:23:08.208
Modi you stand and say so that everyone can hear.

00:23:19.250 --> 00:23:23.583
Otherwise sit down and say whole thing. I must hear everything.

00:23:23.834 --> 00:23:27.583
I must hear first of all.

00:23:28.917 --> 00:23:31.999
Mala, you look after this and give it to ...

00:23:32.333 --> 00:23:35.083
When it finishes  you have to give it to everyone.

00:23:49.959 --> 00:23:54.208
First smaller, smaller wood, smaller.There are smaller ones.

00:24:02.333 --> 00:24:06.166
Soak it in the ghee and then put it

00:24:07.291 --> 00:24:10.166
Soak it in the ghee.

01:38:27.917 --> 01:38:33.750
Now put badhas (negativities) in fire and complete the havan.

01:50:49.208 --> 01:50:52.999
Do Purna Ahuti now. (Complete the offering now.)

01:50:53.250 --> 01:50:56.333
Leave all things whatever remaining to Modi.

01:50:56.583 --> 01:50:59.792
Say it (Purna Ahuti Mantra) and put in the fire.

01:51:10.709 --> 01:51:13.333
Put it in the fire.

01:51:32.208 --> 01:51:35.333
Take that rice to put in the fire.

01:51:35.875 --> 01:51:38.542
Take rice and this.

01:52:12.083 --> 01:52:15.959
Put inside otherwise it (coconut) will break and all will get hurt.

01:52:16.750 --> 01:52:19.417
You stand up and [saying] everybody can't.

01:52:19.667 --> 01:52:22.625
GREGOIRE: I would like on your behalf to thank

01:52:22.834 --> 01:52:26.583
Sir Chandrika Prasad Shrivastava

01:52:26.917 --> 01:52:30.750
who has come and joined us here.

01:52:31.792 --> 01:52:37.625
For the Sahaja Yogis who are

01:52:37.917 --> 01:52:44.917
newer than others maybe very briefly we should say

01:52:45.333 --> 01:52:49.250
a few words about what we have learned from

01:52:49.500 --> 01:52:52.125
Mister Shrivastava.

01:52:52.375 --> 01:52:54.625
We live in a world

01:52:54.834 --> 01:53:00.208
where the rich and the mighty are rotten

01:53:00.542 --> 01:53:06.083
and in Mister Shrivastava we found someone

01:53:06.375 --> 01:53:10.667
who had wealth, power

01:53:10.875 --> 01:53:15.625
but much more dignity and dharma.

01:53:16.417 --> 01:53:22.959
He represents for all of us an image of fatherhood

01:53:23.166 --> 01:53:27.999
as we would like all the people in charge of this society to be

01:53:28.250 --> 01:53:30.917
and we are especially thankful

01:53:31.125 --> 01:53:33.959
not for of course what we has does for IMCO (Maritime agency of UN)

01:53:34.125 --> 01:53:40.667
but all what He has been doing for our Guru

01:53:41.041 --> 01:53:45.291
at the time when Sahaja Yoga was really faltering

01:53:45.500 --> 01:53:52.458
on the shoulders of seven rather dubious people around London.

01:53:52.667 --> 01:53:55.792
I can say so, I was one of them at the time.

01:53:56.709 --> 01:54:01.542
Sahaja Yoga was supported with an extreme generosity

01:54:01.834 --> 01:54:07.291
and extreme disponibility by Mister Shrivastava and I should say

01:54:07.500 --> 01:54:10.959
that this support has never failed and is still going on

01:54:11.125 --> 01:54:14.458
and for all this...

01:54:14.999 --> 01:54:17.500
I mean good speech is supposed to be short

01:54:17.709 --> 01:54:21.083
so I'll stop here because the topic is very inspiring.

01:54:21.291 --> 01:54:25.709
It's always a very great joy for me personally

01:54:25.959 --> 01:54:28.709
to be able to express the feelings that we feel,

01:54:28.917 --> 01:54:32.250
that we have for him and on your behalf

01:54:32.458 --> 01:54:38.125
I would like to offer him this very small present.

01:54:39.083 --> 01:54:41.667
Thank You, Sir.

01:55:06.999 --> 01:55:10.999
SIR C.P.: Do you allow me to say something? SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

01:55:19.917 --> 01:55:25.458
SIR C.P.: My dear members of this wonderful Sahaja Yoga family,

01:55:28.166 --> 01:55:34.625
My feelings are so full that I may not be able to say much.

01:55:35.000 --> 01:55:38.999
As Gregoire himself said, speeches should be short.

01:55:39.250 --> 01:55:42.542
But instead of thanking me I think

01:55:42.875 --> 01:55:46.291
I owe to you all a deep and sincere

01:55:46.542 --> 01:55:49.458
and profound debt of gratitude

01:55:49.667 --> 01:55:52.667
and I say this in all sincerity,

01:55:52.999 --> 01:55:56.709
because to me you represent

01:55:57.083 --> 01:56:01.834
that part of the world which is pure, which is good.

01:56:02.500 --> 01:56:04.583
In the world that we live in,

01:56:04.792 --> 01:56:08.792
there are many forces which are acting against goodness,

01:56:08.999 --> 01:56:12.667
against purity, against peace, against cooperation.

01:56:12.959 --> 01:56:14.999
Against mankind.

01:56:15.166 --> 01:56:17.208
In fact if you see all round

01:56:17.417 --> 01:56:23.792
there are forces of destruction almost threatening us every moment.

01:56:24.125 --> 01:56:28.542
At this time it is extremely important

01:56:28.750 --> 01:56:32.834
that there should be someone and some people

01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:36.834
who spread the message of spiritual evolution,

01:56:37.125 --> 01:56:40.333
who give to mankind hope for future.

01:56:40.750 --> 01:56:43.000
While if there is no force like that

01:56:43.333 --> 01:56:47.125
mankind itself may be at peril.

01:56:48.083 --> 01:56:51.375
It is difficult always to talk of one's own Wife,

01:56:51.667 --> 01:56:54.542
but I have to because

01:56:55.375 --> 01:56:58.834
She has been the embodiment

01:56:59.083 --> 01:57:03.500
and the soul of that Divinity,

01:57:03.875 --> 01:57:08.792
that force of goodness, which is spreading.

01:57:09.500 --> 01:57:12.291
She has given Herself totally to this,

01:57:12.500 --> 01:57:15.999
because there cannot be any compromises

01:57:16.500 --> 01:57:19.750
where Divine work is concerned.

01:57:19.999 --> 01:57:22.083
One has to be totally in it,

01:57:22.291 --> 01:57:25.417
one has to belong to it totally.

01:57:43.625 --> 01:57:46.625
I have to thank you also because

01:57:46.999 --> 01:57:50.125
you give Her such love and such affection

01:57:50.625 --> 01:57:53.792
and you fill Her with such joy.
