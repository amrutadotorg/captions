00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:05.580
We're working very hard there, all of them are working very hard and for Your coming here, Mother.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:10.720
- Very sweet of you.
- with a lot of love.
- Very sweet of you, really.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:19.420
Because there's so many seekers in Greece, I was sure about it. You have to tap the real people.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.820
And all these false gurus did not come here many. I don't think they came - did they?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.080
Most of them they were not allowed to come in.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:36.140
- Like Rajneesh was not allowed?
- Was not allowed. Harash [UNCLEAR] was not allowed, some other fellow was not allowed to come in

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.260
and because Greek people don't have too much money, so

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.560
- this was good not prosperous.
- They were not attracted.
- They were not attracted.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.400
That's very good.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:05.000
- Alright?
- [UNCLEAR]
- Thank you.
- Can I have in front of You?

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.100
So now, what's the program, you tell Me?

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.540
Today Mother, rest for You; You'll be resting and tomorrow uh...

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:23.940
You will be, by Your Grace, a pooja at the new center. After tomorrow, we say, Press day

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.580
and Wednesday, the Public Program.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.520
- But when is the Pooja?
- Tomorrow. Tomorrow?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.160
- What time?
- Anytime Mother, You will say - afternoon, night?

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.040
Whatever suits, I mean, you people.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.680
Normally, whatever time I give is never suits - is for you to decide. [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.240
Is a fact, I mean.  Even if I give you some time;This time, they said, "Easter Puja will be 10 o'clock." I said, "Alright."

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.880
[UNCLEAR] 10 o'clock, 11 o' clock, 12 o'clock - no body called Me. I said, " Now what is it? Am I going to go on My own?"

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.680
They were preparing,  you know, decorating, this, that.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:14.880
So, I said, "Whenever is the right time then only you'll finish - whatever it is.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:21.200
Howsoever I may try, not going to work out." I was just ready in time.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:30.320
So, when you are ready, you call Me, I'll be there. Let's keep it like that - open - because I don't want to hurry you up also.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:36.000
You'll be very busy garlanding everything, hurrying up

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:42.420
- The first time You came Shri Mataji
- Annh?
- The first time You came, Shri Mataji for the Athena Puja
- Haan

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.120
we had set in the morning. When it was in the afternoon, then there was a rest, [UNCLEAR] slept

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.700
- [UNCLEAR]
- Yeah

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.800
- Then we arrived in the program late - one hour late. Just after the Puja we went to the program
- Just what's out, you take it easy

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.620
You see, we have to take very easy, all these things. There was no way any hard and fast rule about it.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:15.140
[ASIDE -  Can I have some water?] We cannot make any hard and fast rule about it - it's that the point.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.980
Just whenever it is auspicious, just works out.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.840
One day in Lonavala, we had arranged a program at 11 0'clock or something.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:36.320
I didn't say anything, you see, then after 11 0'clock, I

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:41.180
was sitting still there. They said, "Mother, the Puja is...," I said, "Alright, I'm coming, coming."

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.880
Then 12 0'clock I went for a bath, so they said, "Now, why Mother is taking so much time."

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:54.940
Then about, I came out about 1 0'clock and I said, "Say 1:30 we'll have Puja," - they couldn't understand it.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.980
I said, "Alright, bring the Indian calendar. See when is the...,"

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:08.740
So the, what you call the night when there is no, when there's no moon, you see - we call that

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.620
- when there's no moon
- In English?
- I mean, in, in -

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.240
- I don't know.
- I don't know what you call that.
- Dark night.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:21.620
- Dark night
- Dark night

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:32.080
In Sanskrit, we call it Amavasya. I said, "See, how far is Amavasya?" They said, "Mother, it is 1:30." I said, "See.

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:40.740
How could you start your Puja at,  before 1:30?" So they were all...

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:48.620
But we don't have to see any calendar - it just works out alright.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:00.460
But in nowadays we don't observe anything like that but at least the day when it is dark night

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:04.980
one should not have a Puja - that's one thing for sure.

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.820
But I don't know if you have got English, Indian calendar in English.

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:16.400
- I'm not sure; We don't have.
- I should get some for all of you - I'll give you as a present.

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.460
- Indian calendar goes with the moon or the Sun?
- In India they still believe in all this very much, you see.

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.480
- Does it go with the moon or with the Sun, Mother?
- Annh?
- Does it go with the moon or with the Sun?
- Moon

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.640
- Not with the Sun - like Muslims have
- Yeah.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:51.080
So, like Eid, you see, comes on the Navratri day. First Navratri day there is Eid

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.580
and another Navratri is Navroz of the, you see, Persian.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:06.240
Since all ancient times, I think, everywhere there was moon only

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:12.240
but in modern times their main it is Sun with 365 days fixed.

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:19.700
Only one day is fixed - is the 14th of January

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.120
when they change, the Sun changes it's axis

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:31.320
to this side; That's the only thing. We call it as Sankranti.

00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:46.940
I mean, I'm sure, in these also they must be knowing all about [UNCLEAR]; Horoscope has come from Greece only.

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.560
- from these people. It must have come from India
- India
- but later on it was developed.

00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:59.040
But the Western horoscope is made out according to the Sun -

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:07.860
like a circle and a thing in the middle but Indian is made like a square.  I don't know - how is a Greek horoscope?

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.700
- Mother, don't know.
- Anybody knows about Greek horoscope?
- [GREEK]

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:23.220
- [GREEK]
- It's round, it's round
- It's round - then it's with the Sun.

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:28.660
But Indian is square - they have a square.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.920
Mine starts from the zero, in the center - it goes all over.

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:45.200
You're the center of the

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:57.280
- We have a lot of new people, Mother, here
- I know
- They see You for the first time and
- Tell Me their names.

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:07.400
Alright, this is [UNCLEAR] ex-colleague of mine at, we used to work together

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.580

00:15:34.260 --> 00:15:38.980
- Is that the Zeus?
- This is Zeus temple.
- Which one is that?
- This one in the corner.

00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.800
- After St. George
- Zeus
- Zeus.

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.620
- He's Parshurama
- Yes, Mother - the temple of Shri Parshurama

00:15:52.020 --> 00:16:00.020
- He was, his vow was broken by Rama, you know. Know the story of -
- No Mother.
- You know the story

00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:04.600
- I thought, he was the same Incarnation at different time
- Annh?
- I thought he was different time

00:16:04.780 --> 00:16:09.380
- No, no, he came before
- Before
- He came to announce Shri Rama's this thing

00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:13.120
I was reading, before Sahaja yoga, Mother, a beautiful book by

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:17.920
who Adiguru Dattatreya was giving instructions to Parshurama

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:24.120
Of course. Not only that but he, since he played a very big role in India also

00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:30.560
he was, he had a, a

00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:38.100
thunderbolt as his ayudha

00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:46.420
and also he had a bow and a that

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:53.940
- What do you call that - bow and a
- Arrows, arrows
- bow and arrows, yeah and

00:16:54.620 --> 00:17:01.520
he kept it with this father of Sita - Janaka

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:10.340
because Janaka was the Adi Dattatreya; He taught him so he kept with him that "You keep it with you."

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:16.620
And he said, "Except for the, for the Incarnation of Vishnu

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:22.580
no one can lift this - it is so heavy, no one can lift even."

00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:29.740
So he, Sita came and She just lifted it just like that like a play.

00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:33.200
So, then he realized that She must be something great.

00:17:33.900 --> 00:17:40.240
Then he said that, "Her husband, whosoever will be the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu."

00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:48.380
Then it so happened that some marriage was announced and as we have in India, you know,

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.460
swayamvara, that the girl, the girl has to go and choose her husband

00:17:54.060 --> 00:18:01.100
and for a princess, all the kings and kings of very great nations were sitting there

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:08.920
different, different kings and one of them was Ravana also, so no body could lift it even.

00:18:09.260 --> 00:18:16.520
Ravana lifted it but it fell on him and he just fell down, so Sita laughed at it, you see [UNCLEAR]

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:23.180
Then Shri Rama came and He just picked it up, like this and He put the arrow, you see,

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:31.480
so Sita garlanded Him; She knew, of course, who He was but when he did that, you see, it broke also

00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:40.440
- uh.. his
- He broke
- He broke it, Shri Rama broke it [UNCLEAR] broken, we can say. He didn't deliberately do.

00:18:41.760 --> 00:18:46.100
So, this Zeus came. He was a very hot-tempered fellow, this Parshurama

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:52.960
- Yes, Mother.
- Really known to be very right-sided, you see - Greek after all [LAUGHTER]

00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.020
So, he got very angry, "How dare you break my

00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.080
uh.. this thing, bow and, who are You and this is," started shouting at Him.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:08.980
So, Lakshman got very angry. He said, "I'll show you who He is just now. Come and fight with me,"

00:19:09.180 --> 00:19:14.820
and so Rama said, "Keep quiet.It's alright, it's alright, it's just," and

00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:23.180
then he realized that Shri Rama is the advent which he had to, he had to profess, you see, before that.

00:19:23.820 --> 00:19:26.980
As like, before Christ came John, the Baptist, you see,

00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:34.280
so then Parshurama then said that, "This is the Incarnation of Shri Vishnu.

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.500
That's the only one who was going to lift my bow."

00:19:39.620 --> 00:19:44.820
So, that's how first of all, Shri Rama was told but Shri Rama had forgotten

00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:52.880
because He had to become absolutely a human-being, so he had forgotten about His own Incarnation within Him.

00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:59.280
The first time He was told that He is the Incarnation, so that's how it worked out

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:07.500
- but you all have God's like this Poseidon and all that but we have Varuna,
- Yes, Shri Mataji

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:15.300
- Indra; Indra also, you have, I think, the King of all the Gods - who is He?
- Zeus is the King of all Gods

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.600
- No, Indra
- Indra [UNCLEAR]
- Annh?

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:27.260
- Indra, [UNCLEAR], Varuna were earlier Gods in Greece
- Indra, Varuna

00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:32.760
Indra and Varuna but I understand Varuna was to worship as

00:20:33.180 --> 00:20:38.080
God of the [UNCLEAR] Mataji

00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:43.600
- Varuna was the same as this Lord of the Sea
- Poseidon Lord of the Sea
- Poseidon was Varuna

00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:51.320
The mythology, Mother, says that the goddess of Sea now, was, came out of the head of Zeus

00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.480
- Of?
- the head of Zeus and She was [UNCLEAR -PROSTRATING?] Her arrow,

00:20:58.220 --> 00:21:04.240
say Kundalini, [UNCLEAR] palas - palo means vibrate.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:11.620
She used to vibrate. Palas - Palo is a word which means to vibrate; So She has now Palas because she was vibrating

00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:18.620
the, what we call it, sphere. Sphere - the ball which goes like that - sphere

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:27.360
- and they say that it came on top of the head of Zeus - which is probably the Kundalini, Mother.
- Yes, of course, it is that only.

00:21:28.500 --> 00:21:34.280
But lots of things were changed also, I don't know why, but they made all the gods

00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:41.140
look like ordinary people and gave them all the weaknesses, everything attached to them.

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:47.320
But there are two things - one is the devas - these are devas - Poseidon and all these are devas

00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:54.680
and Devatas are the ones which are on your centers, so they're absolutely Pure, pure Gods

00:21:55.180 --> 00:22:02.040
because they're all fixed identities and they're absolutely pure; They cannot behave like human-beings.

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:09.160
See there are Divine, all of them but they're fixed, you know. They know

00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:16.720
what to do, what they have to do, how to, sort of, manifest

00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:22.800
the Divine laws - everything they know and they are fixed like that and they know how it is to be done, like,

00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:29.160
as if the whole instrument is made and everybody is made to sit on their own seats

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:34.580
and they're working out their own offices, like that, so it's a

00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:41.660
two, two types of devas were there. One, the ones which were on the right side

00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.620
and this, this place was described in the Devi Mahatma as Manipur e dweep.

00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:55.580
See, this is the Manipur, means Nabhi chakra, the Nabhi and I told you when I went to Delphi

00:22:56.480 --> 00:23:03.320
which is the Nabhi. You see, they also say now, that it is the, the navel of the Universe - they say so.

00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:10.460
If you go there, they tell you like this and there I saw Shri Ganesha sitting, very nicely, so it's all

00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:18.740
just works out. Even Athena has a Child God. You see, in the temple if you go, there's a Child God sitting there.

00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.980
and they say, "This is because of Athena. She didn't want anybody to

00:23:24.260 --> 00:23:31.020
enter into Her home - temple;" It's very surprising.

00:23:33.940 --> 00:23:38.660
It is, even the steps are three and a half

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:43.820
steps are like three - one, two, three

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:51.040
and then the second one is half of that and they, they said that, "They are little bit bending like that."

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:57.380
so if you put them through the whole of the world, they will form a circle.

00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:04.660
Haan. What they say is that the comfort from stairs

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:11.900
compensates that the straight line seems to be cut convex, seems from far away

00:24:12.120 --> 00:24:19.060
- but the truth comes around
- Yes, this is three and a half coils of the Kundalini

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:25.620
and the Athenician also has in Her hand, you know, the Kundalini is there. I mean, it's

00:24:25.900 --> 00:24:30.680
all was there and I went and saw the Curator at that time when I first came here.

00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.580
I saw the Curator at the museum and I asked him about Athena.

00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:43.580
They said, "You see, we used to worship Her as a senior Goddess but then, some people went to India and they

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:49.400
found out that they were, there was not only one Athena but three

00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:57.120
they form, She went into three forms; In India they told us, so we believe now there are three forms,"

00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:02.780
but they don't know into details. See, it's a more sort of move on

00:25:03.500 --> 00:25:07.860
understanding - from books you won't get the knowledge. But they did say

00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:13.420
that now we will learnt India that there are three forms of Athena.

00:25:14.240 --> 00:25:19.620
Maha Kali, Maha Laxmi, Maha Saraswati, you see, but they didn't know all that, you see, the details and all that.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:25.140
Actually, even in the Indian Scriptures it's not so well connected. We don't know how to connect

00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:30.240
this into that but only in sahaja yoga you understand their connections.

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:41.000
[Greek]

00:25:41.160 --> 00:25:45.160
Yeah. Now, can I go ahead, Mother, for few more names?

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:53.580
Anna, you're there - this is Anna - Michael's mother and they are sitting.

00:25:54.520 --> 00:26:00.900
And Ellinscope is here? No [GREEK]

00:26:01.620 --> 00:26:06.920
- Elizabeth is there - come along
- Hello!
- from Austria

00:26:07.820 --> 00:26:12.780
[CONVERSATION IN GREEK] and this is Christos

00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:16.840
over there sitting - Christos, a new sahaja yogi

00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:22.900
- What name you say?
- Christos - from Christ
- Yes

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:28.240
- is the husband of Gregora
- [UNCLEAR]

00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:35.580
- My name?
- No
- Christos. Now Christos is say, Christ. Is from Christ - Christos

00:26:36.500 --> 00:26:40.140

00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:43.940
- Chrisakis
- Chrisakis
- Chrisakis

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:49.960
- [UNCLEAR] difficult Chrisakis, isn't it?
- [UNCLEAR]
- For Indians very difficult - Chrisakis

00:26:52.520 --> 00:27:00.160
Most difficult for us is this French. [UNCLEAR]

00:27:02.080 --> 00:27:06.800
French is very difficult and also Americans, you know. The way they speak fiirst.

00:27:07.060 --> 00:27:12.460
One day you can't understand them. They go on [UNCLEAR] [LAUGHTER]

00:27:12.680 --> 00:27:19.920
Then you have to concentrate to learn; A day takes, I take a day to learn their language

00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:23.740
but now the sahaja yogis are much better.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:30.640
Once you know little bit of Sanskrit, your tongue, I think, gets right [UNCLEAR]

00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:38.280
- [UNCLEAR] You rest now, Mother.
- Alright. Thank you very much all of you. Thank you!

[GREEK] Shri Mataji

00:28:27.060 --> 00:28:32.840
- So, where did he catch the false gurus in India?
- I don't know about where he got

00:28:33.660 --> 00:28:38.140
with [UNCLEAR] also, [UNCLEAR] and taking names of the gods

00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:43.740
and he's been to Hare Krishna also [UNCLEAR]
