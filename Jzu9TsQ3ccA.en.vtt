00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.503
Today is a day of Guru Purnima.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:31.249
It is a full moon day, that's why is call as Purnima.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:37.932
The guru has to be like a full moon

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:42.752
means completely grown

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:45.815
completely matured.

00:00:46.905 --> 00:00:49.662
There are sixteen

00:00:51.375 --> 00:00:58.845
kalas or the phases of the Moon and when the complete

00:01:01.205 --> 00:01:07.777
purnima comes in the full moon day all the sixteen kalas are completed.

00:01:08.097 --> 00:01:11.247
You also know that in the Vishuddhi Chakra

00:01:11.597 --> 00:01:14.187
there are sixteen sub plexuses.

00:01:15.537 --> 00:01:17.537
When

00:01:17.667 --> 00:01:18.807
Krishna

00:01:18.807 --> 00:01:25.267
Is described at Virata. He is called as Sampurna - the complete incarnation of Vishnu's aspect,

00:01:25.577 --> 00:01:27.577
because he has got the sexteen

00:01:28.227 --> 00:01:30.227
phases completely done.

00:01:32.157 --> 00:01:39.547
so today's number is 16 + 1= 7

00:01:45.477 --> 00:01:49.097
Now we have to understand the importance of Guru.

00:01:49.437 --> 00:01:52.827
Why should we have a Guru when we have God?

00:01:54.787 --> 00:02:01.275
We have got Shakti then why should we have a Guru? What is the need to have a Guru?

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:11.687
Guru means the weight.

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:17.937
We get our weight

00:02:19.107 --> 00:02:26.706
from the magnetic forces of the Gravity of the Mother Earth.

00:02:28.397 --> 00:02:34.357
So Guru means Gravity - a Gravity in a person.

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:44.146
Why do we need a Guru?

00:02:46.106 --> 00:02:48.106
because to know God

00:02:51.366 --> 00:02:57.704
Is easy, especially in Sahaja Yoga, to be one with Him.

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:08.254
As soon as you get your self-realization in Sahaja Yoga - the modern Sahaja Yoga - immediately you become

00:03:09.376 --> 00:03:13.331
entitled to give realizations to other.

00:03:14.471 --> 00:03:20.911
It was said that guru is the person who makes you meet the divine.

00:03:23.521 --> 00:03:32.101
But it is not true because any self-realised person in the Sahaja Yoga

00:03:32.501 --> 00:03:38.021
can raise the Kundalini and can give self-realization to others immediately after

00:03:38.471 --> 00:03:42.490
they have touched the Sahasrara - opened the Sahasrara.

00:03:43.311 --> 00:03:46.370
But normally a realized soul cannot do it.

00:03:46.791 --> 00:03:54.640
Any born realized soul cannot do it on its own. It has to have authority of Me, and I am today.

00:03:56.491 --> 00:04:03.922
That's why it was said that Guru is a person who makes you meet God. He raises the Kundalini and

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:06.021
makes you one with God.

00:04:07.971 --> 00:04:09.971
Because in those days

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:13.472
when the Gurus were self-realized

00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:25.131
when the Gurus were self-realised

00:04:27.521 --> 00:04:31.161
they had the authority and power

00:04:31.451 --> 00:04:36.251
of raising the Kundalini only after they have reached a very great

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:41.475
state of evolution: complete purification, complete detachment...

00:04:44.161 --> 00:04:54.475
So it was not possible for people to give realization when they just touched

00:04:54.511 --> 00:04:56.511
realised thinking.

00:04:59.051 --> 00:05:04.775
Most of the gurus in the olden days started by first cleansing the people.

00:05:05.681 --> 00:05:11.891
First cleanse them one by one, raise the Kundalini, brought it to every Chakras,

00:05:13.811 --> 00:05:23.715
and then gave them realization. It was a different technique altogether. You can say it was a bullock cart technique.

00:05:26.171 --> 00:05:33.221
That's why one Mantra was given for a particular Chakra where was the problem where the Kundalini was stopping.

00:05:33.269 --> 00:05:39.504
For about, some people used to get it even for ten years they would work out on one chakra.

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:45.154
I have known people who have been working on Agnya for ten years, twenty years.

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:50.618
But you know in Sahaja Yoga we clear it out just like that.

00:05:51.049 --> 00:05:55.018
That has something to do with your particular ?? and ??.

00:06:00.769 --> 00:06:05.677
So the first conception that a person who makes you meet God is the

00:06:05.747 --> 00:06:09.789
guru has to be a little bit advanced.

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:16.366
Because for you now it’s the child’s play to raise the Kundalini and

00:06:16.549 --> 00:06:18.706
make them one with the Divine.

00:06:19.609 --> 00:06:23.859
But still you don’t become guru in the Sahaja Yoga terminology.

00:06:24.799 --> 00:06:31.089
Even if you have vikalpas, you have doubts, about Sahaja Yoga still you can do it if you raise your hand.

00:06:32.489 --> 00:06:39.819
Even when your chitta, attention, is not clear cut still you can do it. You can still do it.

00:06:41.779 --> 00:06:44.739
How? How it has worked out that way,

00:06:46.999 --> 00:06:48.999
so beautifully?

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:06.189
It has worked out, I would say, at this stage only. Maybe later on I will tell you. But its pure

00:07:11.959 --> 00:07:18.430
Divine, which is not contaminated by whatever state you may be in, its flowing:

00:07:19.459 --> 00:07:21.459
absolutely pure Divine.

00:07:22.999 --> 00:07:27.699
With others it was different, they had to cleanse it, clear it out.

00:07:30.109 --> 00:07:32.711
As an instrument you are perfect,

00:07:34.609 --> 00:07:36.609
but as a guru you are not.

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.571
Whatever may be your defects

00:07:46.069 --> 00:07:52.331
or whatever you maybe lacking, you raise your hand and the Kundalini will rise,

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:54.941
On your fingers it is going to move.

00:07:55.631 --> 00:07:57.631
You get tremendous power.

00:07:59.381 --> 00:08:01.381
You can ask anyone,

00:08:02.231 --> 00:08:05.676
they’ll tell you they are surprised. They are jealous of you.

00:08:05.661 --> 00:08:11.251
They can’t understand that how, by raising your fingers, that you are perfect instruments.

00:08:11.641 --> 00:08:15.901
Because you are created by somebody really perfect.

00:08:17.361 --> 00:08:20.298
But you are not perfect gurus:

00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:29.681
that one has to understand. And that is why you need a guru to tell you all that, what is the perfection.

00:08:38.261 --> 00:08:42.141
Now as I have told you, that guru means gravity.

00:08:46.201 --> 00:08:48.201
You cannot say

00:08:48.721 --> 00:08:50.721
where is the axis of

00:08:52.171 --> 00:08:57.861
Mother Earth is? You cannot see it. I mean you cannot see it, you cannot feel it.

00:08:58.691 --> 00:09:03.193
But they say there is an axis on which the Mother Earth rotates.

00:09:03.211 --> 00:09:05.591
There is an energy

00:09:05.651 --> 00:09:09.011
It's an energy on which this Mother Earth rotates.

00:09:11.831 --> 00:09:13.831
In the same way you have an axis,

00:09:16.311 --> 00:09:18.311
which is your Sushumna,

00:09:22.691 --> 00:09:25.801
which gives you the gravity.

00:09:32.681 --> 00:09:34.681
The first

00:09:36.961 --> 00:09:38.961
important thing

00:09:39.001 --> 00:09:41.001
for a guru is

00:09:42.281 --> 00:09:46.011
that your gravity point is one.

00:09:54.481 --> 00:09:56.481
Everything centres on gravity.

00:10:02.971 --> 00:10:04.381
Unless and until

00:10:04.381 --> 00:10:06.821
Your attention is completely

00:10:07.861 --> 00:10:10.616
fixed on to that gravity point within you

00:10:10.981 --> 00:10:14.141
— which is called as dhrugva,is a fixed point —

00:10:18.341 --> 00:10:24.516
ou cannot become a guru.

00:10:34.501 --> 00:10:37.661
So the gravity in you comes to you

00:10:39.691 --> 00:10:44.591
by clearing your attention, by looking at your attention where does it go?

00:10:45.361 --> 00:10:48.171
How do you reach your gravity point?

00:10:49.561 --> 00:10:51.561
or anything

00:10:56.191 --> 00:11:01.581
that has a gravity point? How do we discover it? We go on balancing it,

00:11:03.931 --> 00:11:10.328
and when the balance is complete, that time we say this is the gravity point.

00:11:12.531 --> 00:11:18.074
In the same way your attention should hold your gravity point in complete balance.

00:11:18.291 --> 00:11:23.891
So the first thing is that you should be a balanced person.

00:11:27.391 --> 00:11:29.391
But a balanced person

00:11:32.011 --> 00:11:34.955
is not a fixed person,

00:11:36.821 --> 00:11:39.785
he is not rigid.

00:11:40.071 --> 00:11:44.191
But an imbalanced person is a person who runs here, there,

00:11:45.111 --> 00:11:53.257
there, even after coming to Sahaja Yoga: running after this, running after that, running after that. Such a person

00:11:53.561 --> 00:11:55.561
cannot achieve much.

00:11:55.607 --> 00:11:59.947
Fix your gravity points, the balancing point, with Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:06.787 --> 00:12:08.787
That is much [more] important

00:12:09.817 --> 00:12:14.107
than knowing anything else. First of all fix your gravity point

00:12:14.887 --> 00:12:17.547
then you will be amazed that,

00:12:18.667 --> 00:12:23.007
whatever you see apart from Sahaj Yoga,

00:12:25.137 --> 00:12:34.869
in the light of Sahaja Yoga, you will realise that, how it relates to Sahaja Yog

00:12:35.157 --> 00:12:37.507
as it relates to you gravity point.

00:12:38.757 --> 00:12:43.457
Say it is against it, still you will see where it is against.

00:12:44.487 --> 00:12:49.244
If it is for it, you will see where it is for. For example you will read books:

00:12:49.284 --> 00:12:53.913
immediately you will know what is the truth, what is not the truth.

00:12:54.023 --> 00:12:56.654
But if you do not have that point fixed or

00:12:58.144 --> 00:13:00.064
attained,

00:13:00.064 --> 00:13:07.856
then you will be slipping down this side or that side. Anything else can attract you, you can slip down from Truth.

00:13:10.714 --> 00:13:14.926
So that point has to be fixed first of all within yourselves:

00:13:15.574 --> 00:13:17.574
dhruvapada as they call it;

00:13:18.724 --> 00:13:20.724
the position of the fixed point

00:13:22.654 --> 00:13:28.032
from which we understand that everything radiates from it,

00:13:28.144 --> 00:13:35.174
everything is controlled from here. The light within us by which we see what is darkness and what is

00:13:35.192 --> 00:13:38.214
reality

00:13:45.004 --> 00:13:47.004
But do all this,

00:13:51.414 --> 00:13:57.599
even if you glorify and say all the names and chant everything, it has no meaning

00:13:59.154 --> 00:14:04.183
unless and until you develop discipline about it.

00:14:05.154 --> 00:14:10.934
Discipline is the sthai bhav or you can say the

00:14:13.914 --> 00:14:17.575
emotion of permanence

00:14:20.094 --> 00:14:26.236
for a guru state, guru seva, or for becoming a guru.

00:14:26.334 --> 00:14:31.196
You must discipline your body, discipline your mind, discipline yourself.

00:14:32.964 --> 00:14:38.877
Sahaja Yoga is such a simple thing to have: I mean you are just connected with me.

00:14:39.117 --> 00:14:50.068
But you are not a guru. So how do you discipline yourself? Some people have awkward way in their bodies,

00:14:52.798 --> 00:14:57.668
then they should get to it, that they have a proper way in their body.

00:14:57.738 --> 00:15:00.238
Mould your body.

00:15:03.398 --> 00:15:08.860
It is not to torture your body but to master your body.

00:15:10.278 --> 00:15:18.001
For example, I would not say that you go and sit in the cold ice water. Its wrong,

00:15:18.778 --> 00:15:23.368
to freeze yourself and make your bones horrible.

00:15:23.384 --> 00:15:28.358
But you must do all that is required to give you a supple body

00:15:28.468 --> 00:15:34.034
and a body that can live under any circumstances.

00:15:37.854 --> 00:15:40.124
A little bit of course you have to exert also,

00:15:41.124 --> 00:15:43.714
that you should be able to sit on the ground properly,

00:15:44.814 --> 00:15:47.444
that you should be able to sleep on the ground properly.

00:15:50.474 --> 00:15:55.264
There should be no problem about these things. You have to discipline.

00:15:55.524 --> 00:16:01.774
Sahaja Yoga is a real blessing, but can be sometimes a blessing in disguise.

00:16:03.024 --> 00:16:05.024
If you take it for granted

00:16:05.664 --> 00:16:09.233
you will drift out, you wont go very further.

00:16:10.974 --> 00:16:15.754
So the body should be such that it should be able to take lot of load upon itself,

00:16:16.014 --> 00:16:18.886
should be able to do a lot of work.

00:16:23.924 --> 00:16:28.286
This is for you to decide about your own body.

00:16:29.704 --> 00:16:32.504
Now you see your gurus body how it is:

00:16:33.724 --> 00:16:38.424
I take lot of work out of my body. I can work for hours together.

00:16:40.414 --> 00:16:42.804
I can keep awake for hours together.

00:16:44.344 --> 00:16:46.344
I’ll never

00:16:48.994 --> 00:16:51.219
even once

00:16:51.244 --> 00:16:53.244
ay that my body is no good.

00:16:55.154 --> 00:16:58.743
It’s such a nice friend I have.

00:16:58.814 --> 00:17:05.789
But there is a very great tapasya state, penance we have to have,

00:17:05.804 --> 00:17:07.804
tremendous penance.

00:17:08.264 --> 00:17:11.018
Because this is a human body

00:17:11.054 --> 00:17:19.596
which had to work out lots of things. You know at the time of Rama, He had to walk bare feet all the way.

00:17:20.804 --> 00:17:24.344
He was a King and He had to live in a hut.

00:17:28.924 --> 00:17:32.634
So do not be dominated by luxuries and comforts.

00:17:34.408 --> 00:17:37.328
I do not mean to say that you unnecessarily

00:17:37.358 --> 00:17:43.698
torture your body, that’s not the point at all. Because I must bring the balancing point, always.

00:17:44.768 --> 00:17:49.968
But do not pamper your body that it becomes a hurdle for your penance.

00:17:52.508 --> 00:17:54.508
Keep your body clean,

00:17:56.698 --> 00:17:59.379
respect your body,

00:18:00.558 --> 00:18:06.248
and it will be very happy when it will know that you have used it for the Divine purpose.

00:18:12.542 --> 00:18:17.302
There’s an Indian word for which we call it: a ‘bhaitak’ here.

00:18:17.831 --> 00:18:23.881
I don’t know, there is no English equal to that. But bhaitak means the power to sit:

00:18:24.071 --> 00:18:26.693
that’s the gravity within you.

00:18:26.993 --> 00:18:29.713
How long can you sit in one posture,

00:18:30.893 --> 00:18:36.723
what is your bhaitak. Like any studies or anything they’ll ask, “What is your bhaitak?”

00:18:38.963 --> 00:18:43.893
“Have you got the bhaitak?” Is the power to be seated on one point:

00:18:45.653 --> 00:18:47.653
how long you can sit

00:18:48.083 --> 00:18:50.083
continuously.

00:18:52.703 --> 00:19:00.363
That is how you judge your gravity. Unless and until you have a bhaitak you cannot be a guru.

00:19:03.203 --> 00:19:08.843
So the body is to be brought round properly. It has to be disciplined.

00:19:11.833 --> 00:19:18.416
It’s no question of becoming thin or fat, but the body should be such that you should be able to

00:19:20.173 --> 00:19:23.733
use it for your purpose as a guru.

00:19:26.993 --> 00:19:31.116
Sometimes, you will find you can’t sleep on the ground:

00:19:32.133 --> 00:19:36.583
then you [should] sleep on the ground for three, four days, then the body will be very happy.

00:19:36.753 --> 00:19:38.753
It will pain [for] one or two days.

00:19:39.673 --> 00:19:41.973
But do not insult your body.

00:19:42.993 --> 00:19:45.792
This is the other side of the discipline:

00:19:46.233 --> 00:19:50.083
we don’t take our bath, we don’t keep ourselves all right.

00:19:50.173 --> 00:19:53.443
Then you are insulting your body. Look after it.

00:19:53.883 --> 00:19:55.883
You may have to

00:19:55.893 --> 00:19:57.893
look after its softness,

00:19:58.503 --> 00:20:02.089
the gentleness of the body. Treat it with respect.

00:20:04.413 --> 00:20:09.053
By becoming barbaric you are insulting your body.

00:20:14.563 --> 00:20:16.563
So the body

00:20:17.053 --> 00:20:21.763
is very important, this is made of five elements,

00:20:21.793 --> 00:20:26.973
and all these five elements within us, as gurus,

00:20:27.003 --> 00:20:29.313
has to be sparkling.

00:20:30.913 --> 00:20:37.256
I can go on like this but now you think about it: in future, what have you to do with your body.

00:20:38.366 --> 00:20:41.466
How you are going to use the five elements

00:20:42.326 --> 00:20:49.916
within your body, to cleanse them, make then beautiful so that your light sparkles.

00:20:54.206 --> 00:20:59.606
The gravity comes to you in your body this way:

00:21:01.086 --> 00:21:03.086
that

00:21:03.096 --> 00:21:08.206
you start generating your power or your principle of gurutva,

00:21:09.816 --> 00:21:14.846
principle of your mastery, through this point of your gravity.

00:21:19.306 --> 00:21:23.906
The second point is your attention should have that gravity.

00:21:25.516 --> 00:21:28.293
Your attention is very important.

00:21:29.146 --> 00:21:31.843
A person who is easily disturbed

00:21:33.316 --> 00:21:36.503
is not a deep person.

00:21:39.276 --> 00:21:43.868
Or easily taken to something, like say emotions.

00:21:46.096 --> 00:21:53.790
Or easily to some other, say, intellectual pursuit.

00:21:55.556 --> 00:21:58.880
As gurus there will be temptations for you.

00:22:04.776 --> 00:22:11.808
People will be challenging your state. A person comes out with a very big intellectual ‘truth’ or something,

00:22:12.576 --> 00:22:18.536
then immediately you feel challenged about it and you will say, “All right let me handle the situation.”

00:22:18.666 --> 00:22:22.266
Handle it at the Sahaja Yoga point, on your gravity.

00:22:22.326 --> 00:22:25.937
Just sit down on your gravity and see for yourself.

00:22:26.107 --> 00:22:29.737
Immediately you will know how to handle the situation.

00:22:29.777 --> 00:22:33.827
You need not talk to that person, you’ll handle the situation all right:

00:22:33.877 --> 00:22:37.638
not on [the] intellectual level but on your gravity.

00:22:39.037 --> 00:22:45.327
If the attention has the gravity, it pulls down the ego and the superego of other people.

00:22:52.997 --> 00:22:56.652
Then you will not be frustrated or frantic.

00:23:00.317 --> 00:23:02.317
Also, if you can

00:23:03.237 --> 00:23:08.357
start from the outside it may work out with human beings;

00:23:08.757 --> 00:23:12.766
Like study your behaviour how you behave towards others.

00:23:12.937 --> 00:23:15.947
Or study your attention how it behaves towards

00:23:16.497 --> 00:23:18.497
outside:

00:23:20.747 --> 00:23:23.913
what attracts your attention,

00:23:26.057 --> 00:23:32.477
what attracts your attention. Study your attention.

00:23:34.317 --> 00:23:40.904
By that study you will be able to fix your attention

00:23:43.977 --> 00:23:46.127
in its maryada, in its boundaries.

00:23:46.977 --> 00:23:49.587
Once you put the boundaries to

00:23:49.647 --> 00:23:53.047
the attention then the depth starts developing.

00:23:53.167 --> 00:23:59.543
The person who has no boundaries can never have depth, he will be spreading just like that, always;

00:23:59.583 --> 00:24:01.293
no depth at all.

00:24:01.293 --> 00:24:05.523
So you have to put boundaries by understanding your attention,

00:24:06.033 --> 00:24:10.163
that, “No not more than that.” “All right not more than that.”

00:24:11.763 --> 00:24:16.525
Like some people in Sahaja Yoga I have seen, they get interested in a patient,

00:24:17.613 --> 00:24:20.463
then for them that patient becomes important.

00:24:20.523 --> 00:24:26.873
Or get interested in some person that he must get Realisation: “my mother,” “my father,” “my, my” .

00:24:28.893 --> 00:24:33.023
And all the time they are talking about it: “my jobs,”

00:24:34.573 --> 00:24:37.323
“my clothes,” some sort of a ‘my’.

00:24:42.073 --> 00:24:48.555
And they don’t know how to draw the line. You must know where to draw the line, is maryadas.

00:24:51.403 --> 00:24:56.553
Otherwise the whole thing will fritter away. You will become a frivolous person.

00:24:56.573 --> 00:24:59.073
There won’t be any gravity in you.

00:25:03.903 --> 00:25:09.229
So you must know how far to go with a person when you are dealing as a guru,

00:25:11.073 --> 00:25:13.073
then you are a master.

00:25:13.683 --> 00:25:21.049
But if you do not know where to draw the line, you may be crossing the line and getting into his clutches.

00:25:26.673 --> 00:25:34.930
So the best way to handle the situation is to get into thoughtless awareness,

00:25:36.663 --> 00:25:43.492
again and again and again and again, and you establish that clearly.

00:25:45.073 --> 00:25:49.493
Now, some of them complain to me that it’s not an easy thing to do.

00:25:49.543 --> 00:25:55.083
It’s the easiest thing to do, if you give up all other

00:25:55.113 --> 00:25:57.463
useless things that you are doing.

00:26:04.503 --> 00:26:09.973
And then gravity will give you the wisdom to do the right thing at the right time.

00:26:12.043 --> 00:26:15.721
Ashram is a place where one has to learn to be a guru.

00:26:15.851 --> 00:26:19.611
But I find it is not always a good experiment for people.

00:26:20.923 --> 00:26:26.213
Once they have an ashram they take it for granted. They think, “This is the place for us to nicely come and live and

00:26:26.233 --> 00:26:29.626
and some people will work, some will be enjoying.

00:26:29.696 --> 00:26:33.436
Some will pay some will not pay.

00:26:34.136 --> 00:26:36.636
It’s most surprising.

00:26:41.716 --> 00:26:47.696
You must immediately find out the person who really has the spiritual authority

00:26:49.156 --> 00:26:51.156
and try to follow that person.

00:26:53.536 --> 00:26:59.220
And instead of that we try to meet up with people who are of lower spiritual authority.

00:27:01.086 --> 00:27:09.658
And [if] he sleeps till nine o’clock, everybody sleeps! In an ashram nobody should sleep after six o’clock: is an absolute thing.

00:27:10.446 --> 00:27:12.446
Absurd!

00:27:13.506 --> 00:27:18.251
You must sleep early and get up early. Otherwise you can stay outside.

00:27:23.706 --> 00:27:29.189
You all must get up at six o’clock. Do you know what time your Mother gets up?

00:27:33.476 --> 00:27:39.226
And what I find: nobody is up here.

00:27:39.266 --> 00:27:47.086
In India they all get up very early. But I find nobody is up here and my attention is all wasted.

00:27:54.376 --> 00:27:56.376
And you don’t realise

00:27:57.646 --> 00:28:02.206
how important all these things are. This is the training time for you.

00:28:02.236 --> 00:28:06.446
For this you are born, you have been seeking this for ages now.

00:28:06.506 --> 00:28:09.906
You have got it now, you must discipline yourself.

00:28:10.156 --> 00:28:17.722
But I have seen in ashramas where people pay a big amount, they get up at six o’clock, 4 o’clock, 3 o’clock.

00:28:21.976 --> 00:28:28.521
Because in Sahaja Yoga everything has to come from you. This is the style it is.

00:28:29.806 --> 00:28:34.466
At the most I can ask people who are not all right, to go out for a while,

00:28:34.496 --> 00:28:37.926
and then the join ashram. That helps some people.

00:28:38.566 --> 00:28:43.802
But not more than that; because I am also a Mother though I am a Guru.

00:28:44.296 --> 00:28:50.512
It is you who should mature yourself. You’ll mature much faster than [if] I force things on you.

00:28:50.686 --> 00:28:54.285
Finding faults with others but not with yourself.

00:28:57.396 --> 00:28:59.396
You must have

00:28:59.556 --> 00:29:09.113
a discipline, a time in the morning to get up, do little a puja or something. At least spend half an hour, all of you together.

00:29:09.266 --> 00:29:12.876
You should be ready by 6 or 6.30, sit down,

00:29:15.146 --> 00:29:23.426
do meditation. I have to lay down rules for you now, because you do not want to lay it down.

00:29:24.846 --> 00:29:31.117
I am also amazed that many people do not know even my aarti, after so many years, by heart.

00:29:34.246 --> 00:29:38.559
That is what Sahaja Yoga is, because it’s a Mahamaya.

00:29:44.559 --> 00:29:47.359
So you have to learn it yourself.

00:29:48.119 --> 00:29:50.119
You have to do it yourself.

00:29:50.249 --> 00:29:54.651
It’s easy to talk about Sahaja Yoga, very simple: stand up and talk.

00:29:54.721 --> 00:29:58.351
Because you have heard from your Mother, your talk.

00:29:58.829 --> 00:30:02.551
But it will have no impression on another person!

00:30:03.569 --> 00:30:05.569
It will fritter away.

00:30:07.349 --> 00:30:12.071
Because it must come from your centre of gravity.

00:30:20.725 --> 00:30:24.285
This is the greatest thing you can do to yourself:

00:30:25.245 --> 00:30:27.245
is to discipline yourself fully.

00:30:28.915 --> 00:30:34.895
And compete in disciplining yourself; and make your body all right, your attention correct

00:30:40.605 --> 00:30:47.975
Attention is corrected by many ways. As I said: watch your attention, where does it go.

00:30:50.985 --> 00:30:52.985
Now

00:30:53.475 --> 00:30:56.135
what else are we going to talk but Sahaja Yoga?

00:30:56.775 --> 00:31:01.825
Is there anything more beautiful or more interesting,

00:31:02.805 --> 00:31:05.450
more manifesting than Sahaja Yoga is?

00:31:05.805 --> 00:31:07.805
And what is the job of a guru?

00:31:09.165 --> 00:31:16.392
Is nothing but to expose the Parabrahma Itself, the whole working of the Divine; that is the job of a guru.

00:31:19.125 --> 00:31:22.062
To expose the complete working of the

00:31:22.215 --> 00:31:23.595
Parabrahma

00:31:23.595 --> 00:31:28.961
is the job of a guru in the modern times, not only raising the Kundalini.

00:31:29.085 --> 00:31:36.545
But after raising the Kundalini you should be able to tell all about the Divine powers and everything.

00:31:36.825 --> 00:31:41.836
For that you have to learn, you have to read, you have to understand.

00:31:43.265 --> 00:31:48.769
Do you understand now the difference between the old gurus and modern gurus?

00:31:49.995 --> 00:31:57.245
Because they were brought with such tremendous discipline and hardly one or two used to be great gurus.

00:31:59.265 --> 00:32:01.265
They went through such

00:32:02.455 --> 00:32:08.416
studies and such interrogations and examination and tests

00:32:08.605 --> 00:32:12.826
that by the time they were 75 or so they became gurus.

00:32:13.105 --> 00:32:19.155
But we have to do it quick and the best way is to do it yourself.

00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:30.709
Perhaps the tradition of the Western countries do not give you much

00:32:31.585 --> 00:32:36.619
impetus for disciplining. That’s called cutting out yourself perhaps.

00:32:41.248 --> 00:32:43.248
But a disciplined person

00:32:45.408 --> 00:32:48.738
is the only one who can be a Sahaj Yogi.

00:32:51.548 --> 00:32:53.548
Spontaneity

00:32:54.908 --> 00:32:59.128
works best in a disciplined person.

00:33:00.398 --> 00:33:03.723
A disciplined person is the one who knows the technique,

00:33:03.788 --> 00:33:10.579
and the energy is the spontaneity. But a person who is frittered away what will spontaneity do with it?

00:33:11.759 --> 00:33:13.798
It cannot work it out;

00:33:14.378 --> 00:33:16.378
the instrument is so horrible.

00:33:18.158 --> 00:33:24.002
So you discipline yourselves so that others would be disciplined by your behaviour.

00:33:27.418 --> 00:33:34.218
Once you have disciplined yourself, when you become a guru, you have certain privileges as a master.

00:33:38.168 --> 00:33:39.318
And

00:33:39.318 --> 00:33:44.398
it was used as a weapon by many masters before, you need do that.

00:33:44.398 --> 00:33:48.018
I am just telling you as a side issue — is the temper.

00:33:49.218 --> 00:33:53.269
All the gurus had tremendous temper.

00:33:54.609 --> 00:33:57.069
It was expected of the guru.

00:33:59.059 --> 00:34:02.459
Like I would tell you about Allauddin Khan Sahib

00:34:03.409 --> 00:34:08.920
who was a great musician, was the master of Ravi Shankar and all these people.

00:34:09.009 --> 00:34:12.280
And my father was the political advisor to this

00:34:13.589 --> 00:34:18.379
Maharaja of Maihar. And we went down there, I was there also.

00:34:18.959 --> 00:34:24.889
That time Ravi Shankar was an artist was playing a little bit here and there.

00:34:26.029 --> 00:34:28.693
I mean he was quite a good artist still.

00:34:28.779 --> 00:34:36.219
So his guru had a great respect for my father. He used to treat my father very great reverence.

00:34:36.839 --> 00:34:38.839
So he was playing something,

00:34:39.409 --> 00:34:42.729
he was very good at Mridangam.

00:34:42.869 --> 00:34:48.489
So he played the Mridangam for my father. 

00:34:48.664 --> 00:34:55.589
So in that day the tune or the lehara is there, the tune one has to play, the simple tune;

00:34:55.769 --> 00:35:00.119
 just to play the mridangam, to be played on that (as an accompaniment).

00:35:01.199 --> 00:35:03.649
So my father asked Ravi Shankar to play [missing text see transcript]

00:35:08.549 --> 00:35:13.609
When his guru went away he came and told my father:

00:35:13.709 --> 00:35:19.127
"See this one here [unclear]

00:35:19.751 --> 00:35:24.311
he said, he has broken my sitar on my head this morning. 

00:35:24.461 --> 00:35:31.501
Because I played one rag, one note "swara" one note in a wrong [unclear].

00:35:34.611 --> 00:35:41.477
This is the guru [unclear] you know, you can not take liberties with your guru, at all.

00:35:41.926 --> 00:35:46.826
And at the slightest [mistake] they will take up this and hit you, you see.

00:35:46.926 --> 00:35:48.926
So people used to be very careful.

00:35:49.756 --> 00:35:51.756
If they were sitting near the stone.

00:35:52.206 --> 00:35:54.446
The people would stay away from them

00:35:54.766 --> 00:35:58.280
They would throw stones. They’ll keep a chimta, big chimta like this.

00:35:58.316 --> 00:36:01.666
Anybody coming near them they would hit them.

00:36:01.746 --> 00:36:05.896
At the slightest thing they gave a chimta to a disciple.

00:36:06.566 --> 00:36:12.318
It was a long thing, you know, made out of iron and a chimta is a double pronged thing. 

00:36:12.348 --> 00:36:15.476
And they would hit the person, “Tham!” like this.

00:36:15.517 --> 00:36:20.897
It was the situation before I came in here as your guru.

00:36:20.947 --> 00:36:27.257
 It is difficult to be a guru and a Mother, I cannot do both things together!

00:36:27.397 --> 00:36:30.297
But that was the situation, even those great artist today

00:36:30.277 --> 00:36:34.157
who are playing great things like you’ll hear now Vilayat Khan Sahib:

00:36:34.187 --> 00:36:38.497
 you go and ask him about his guru, how much time he was beaten up,

00:36:38.607 --> 00:36:40.607
absolutely beaten up

00:36:40.897 --> 00:36:48.225
any swara they did wrong was: absolute chastity, absolute discipline.

00:36:49.647 --> 00:36:56.368
If the guru said, “Five o’clock tomorrow,” even if guru comes or not, five o’clock you have to be there.

00:36:56.877 --> 00:36:58.877
For any art

00:36:59.157 --> 00:37:01.157
in the Indian style was like that,

00:37:01.277 --> 00:37:03.237
complete discipline

00:37:03.847 --> 00:37:07.157
Without discipline not even education was imparted:

00:37:09.387 --> 00:37:11.387
terrible taskmasters.

00:37:11.847 --> 00:37:16.267
And that’s what they used which you need not here in Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:19.057 --> 00:37:22.357
There is no need to use temper in Sahaja Yoga

00:37:25.417 --> 00:37:31.797
because I have not given you, imparted, any knowledge to you with temper.

00:37:33.267 --> 00:37:38.155
Perhaps there could be hardly anyone who has seen me in a temper.

00:37:39.317 --> 00:37:46.627
So that is not the way we Sahaja Yogis are going to impart knowledge to others.

00:37:48.087 --> 00:37:50.735
We have to be very mild and sweet,

00:37:51.167 --> 00:37:53.875
because in the pattern of your own Guru,

00:37:53.897 --> 00:37:55.397
because She’s sweet,

00:37:55.397 --> 00:37:56.897
She’s very mild

00:37:56.897 --> 00:37:58.827
and She’s very persuasive

00:37:58.827 --> 00:38:02.130
and kind. In the same way you have to be,

00:38:02.177 --> 00:38:05.217
because that pattern you haven’t learned.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:09.427
That’s why don’t take to that kind of a pattern where people 

00:38:09.417 --> 00:38:12.717
are in a big temper and they come out with a big temper.

00:38:12.874 --> 00:38:16.475
It doesn’t behove a Sahaj Yogi to be like that.

00:38:16.525 --> 00:38:22.685
I mean, they had such tremendous powers also that they could just make somebody into ashes;

00:38:23.335 --> 00:38:27.755
with such a temper they lived. And they had one guru

00:38:29.465 --> 00:38:31.465
somewhere like

00:38:34.535 --> 00:38:35.885
a Rock of Gibraltar,

00:38:36.065 --> 00:38:40.395
that you face him and you hit your head. At least one or twice

00:38:40.395 --> 00:38:44.872
you must have a big hitting from him, otherwise he’s not your guru.

00:38:44.972 --> 00:38:49.002
That was the system.Now we have a great artist sitting here. 

00:38:49.092 --> 00:38:53.572
You must be also remembering his guru, who must have really

00:38:53.625 --> 00:38:55.295
beaten him nicely

00:38:55.322 --> 00:38:57.712
before he imparted knowledge.

00:38:58.502 --> 00:39:01.252
They said, “Without you hit and

00:39:02.652 --> 00:39:07.363
chisel, you cannot make a good

00:39:07.422 --> 00:39:12.522
disciple.” And this time we are going to

00:39:12.612 --> 00:39:15.132
challenge that

00:39:15.212 --> 00:39:20.002
and to prove that our Mother was extremely kind and still

00:39:20.032 --> 00:39:21.892
we are chiseled out beautifully,

00:39:21.892 --> 00:39:29.730
by your own chisel. That’s why I request you to do it yourself because I cannot do it as a Mother.

00:39:32.812 --> 00:39:34.812
And that’s why it is

00:39:34.842 --> 00:39:36.292
your responsibility

00:39:36.292 --> 00:39:37.552
to do it that way.

00:39:37.552 --> 00:39:42.057
Today is the day where we all have to decide that

00:39:42.102 --> 00:39:44.907
we are going to be gurus now.

00:39:45.037 --> 00:39:48.442
I am going to retire as a guru.

00:39:48.442 --> 00:39:50.442
It’s all right to be a Mother to you people.

00:39:50.902 --> 00:39:52.072
now

00:39:52.072 --> 00:39:55.584
you have to be gurus of other people,

00:39:55.912 --> 00:39:59.744
and for that you must know what you should achieve.

00:40:01.192 --> 00:40:05.916
You have all the powers within you, you can manifest them also.

00:40:06.292 --> 00:40:12.372
But you cannot have a following unless and until you become a guru.

00:40:12.502 --> 00:40:15.102
This is the only difference [there] is

00:40:16.862 --> 00:40:21.122
If you want to have a following then you must chisel out yourself 

00:40:21.114 --> 00:40:25.372
in that fashion that, as soon as people see you, they should say,

00:40:25.405 --> 00:40:28.192
“Here is [somebody] with that gravity.”

00:40:30.985 --> 00:40:34.955
I think that should be sufficient for today’s Guru puja.

00:40:36.775 --> 00:40:41.355
Only thing, the last, most important thing is,

00:40:41.545 --> 00:40:47.185
that you cannot make a drama out of it. It has to be a reality.

00:40:47.875 --> 00:40:52.203
By standing like a big, imposing person, you do not become that. 

00:40:52.233 --> 00:40:56.053
On the contrary people will think you are mad.

00:40:58.705 --> 00:41:06.405
It should be from within that you should develop that dignity within yourself, that poise, that balance,

00:41:07.675 --> 00:41:10.629
that understanding, within yourself.

00:41:14.762 --> 00:41:16.762
A kindly poise,

00:41:19.552 --> 00:41:24.292
a beautiful personality,

00:41:24.402 --> 00:41:26.849
benevolent.

00:41:28.312 --> 00:41:31.652
But standing above everyone else by it’s gravity,

00:41:31.672 --> 00:41:33.782
depth, gentlemanliness,

00:41:35.112 --> 00:41:37.112
generosity,

00:41:40.292 --> 00:41:49.571
proper bearing, neatness, cleanliness

00:41:50.161 --> 00:42:03.287
above all, love: a heart like an ocean, most forgiving.

00:42:05.101 --> 00:42:16.352
I am sure next year we’ll have some gurus here who have already got some disciples around them.

00:42:16.892 --> 00:42:18.892
May God bless you.
