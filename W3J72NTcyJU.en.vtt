00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:07.533
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.137
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

00:00:28.306 --> 00:00:39.994
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:52.995
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

00:00:53.196 --> 00:01:03.899
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.875
of the Mother and Christ.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.520
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

00:01:28.721 --> 00:01:35.086
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

00:01:41.698 --> 00:01:45.678
And when they could not explain it,

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:53.638
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

00:02:03.603 --> 00:02:06.802
Even before Christ, they used to have

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:11.386
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

00:02:11.587 --> 00:02:18.577
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

00:02:33.195 --> 00:02:40.338
to worship what they call Yahovah.

00:02:45.432 --> 00:02:52.326
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

00:02:59.175 --> 00:03:05.150
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

00:03:07.174 --> 00:03:11.903
She incarnated before also.

00:03:13.763 --> 00:03:18.521
She incarnated as Sita,

00:03:20.032 --> 00:03:26.020
and then She incarnated as Radha,

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:31.647
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

00:03:33.097 --> 00:03:36.935
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

00:03:37.136 --> 00:03:42.261
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

00:03:50.595 --> 00:03:56.204
He was the son of Radha.

00:03:56.718 --> 00:04:02.488
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

00:04:04.798 --> 00:04:14.264
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

00:04:17.196 --> 00:04:21.747
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

00:04:21.948 --> 00:04:31.003
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:04:40.523 --> 00:04:44.651
All the description about Jesus Christ

00:04:44.852 --> 00:04:52.367
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

00:05:01.365 --> 00:05:08.881
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

00:05:09.082 --> 00:05:11.494
with immaculate conception,

00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:17.788
which She had done before also, as Radha.

00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:44.349
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

00:05:50.441 --> 00:05:57.406
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

00:06:06.504 --> 00:06:10.573
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

00:06:10.774 --> 00:06:16.686
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

00:06:25.131 --> 00:06:29.810
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

00:06:33.544 --> 00:06:45.639
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

00:06:52.124 --> 00:07:01.144
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

00:07:01.345 --> 00:07:06.169
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:12.587
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:34.937
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

00:07:41.954 --> 00:07:50.842
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

00:07:56.921 --> 00:08:04.316
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

00:08:07.897 --> 00:08:13.746
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

00:08:15.437 --> 00:08:20.046
because He is just vibrations.

00:08:22.861 --> 00:08:30.685
So when you do puja to Me,

00:08:30.886 --> 00:08:37.210
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

00:08:48.246 --> 00:08:51.802
If they had done puja to Christ -

00:08:52.003 --> 00:08:59.716
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

00:09:06.336 --> 00:09:14.128
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

00:09:14.329 --> 00:09:23.552
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

00:09:33.111 --> 00:09:39.273
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

00:09:45.757 --> 00:09:54.503
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:07.922
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

00:10:12.183 --> 00:10:17.636
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

00:10:17.837 --> 00:10:23.088
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

00:10:27.365 --> 00:10:30.867
which is the swayambhu,

00:10:31.719 --> 00:10:35.523
is created by the Mother Earth.

00:10:36.547 --> 00:10:42.983
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

00:10:48.667 --> 00:10:55.879
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

00:11:04.175 --> 00:11:12.744
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.367
So I went to see that place

00:11:23.568 --> 00:11:31.144
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

00:11:31.345 --> 00:11:35.841
about say, five inches, at the most.

00:11:42.624 --> 00:11:46.804
And the face was just like Mine,

00:11:48.502 --> 00:11:51.912
exactly like Mine.

00:11:52.113 --> 00:11:59.142
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

00:11:59.343 --> 00:12:07.931
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

00:12:19.898 --> 00:12:22.472
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

00:12:22.673 --> 00:12:28.452
and they started following under a rock,

00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:39.963
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

00:12:44.146 --> 00:12:45.992
And in that light they walked,

00:12:46.193 --> 00:12:49.378
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

00:12:49.579 --> 00:12:55.552
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

00:13:08.063 --> 00:13:14.461
So they worship that statue in that place.

00:13:18.103 --> 00:13:24.106
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

00:13:28.247 --> 00:13:32.065
as I give you vibrations,

00:13:32.266 --> 00:13:35.658
but not so much

00:13:36.071 --> 00:13:39.226
as I give you.

00:13:39.901 --> 00:13:43.444
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

00:13:43.645 --> 00:13:47.584
who might be giving you vibrations.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:55.218
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

00:13:55.419 --> 00:13:58.975
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

00:13:59.176 --> 00:14:03.623
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

00:14:13.937 --> 00:14:17.132
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

00:14:17.333 --> 00:14:22.010
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

00:14:30.021 --> 00:14:37.121
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

00:14:43.458 --> 00:14:48.188
and there are many sweet water wells there.

00:14:50.653 --> 00:14:53.923
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

00:14:54.124 --> 00:14:57.698
many people took photograph.

00:15:01.537 --> 00:15:07.764
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

00:15:09.917 --> 00:15:15.125
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

00:15:15.326 --> 00:15:25.118
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

00:15:25.340 --> 00:15:30.922
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

00:15:44.354 --> 00:15:49.371
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

00:15:49.572 --> 00:15:54.536
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

00:16:03.970 --> 00:16:07.423
Same is the puja.

00:16:07.764 --> 00:16:15.121
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

00:16:18.329 --> 00:16:26.531
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:39.917
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

00:16:47.975 --> 00:16:50.509
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

00:16:50.710 --> 00:16:59.618
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

00:17:07.059 --> 00:17:15.454
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

00:17:19.354 --> 00:17:23.113
what powers He gives you.

00:17:23.712 --> 00:17:25.929
When you praise those qualities,

00:17:26.130 --> 00:17:33.006
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

00:17:43.716 --> 00:17:47.473
This is how the Divine works,

00:17:49.256 --> 00:17:54.338
as if you get charged with those qualities.

00:17:58.345 --> 00:18:04.649
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

00:18:08.513 --> 00:18:16.153
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

00:18:21.123 --> 00:18:24.947
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

00:18:25.148 --> 00:18:30.246
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

00:18:35.295 --> 00:18:37.960
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.519
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:46.090
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

00:18:59.761 --> 00:19:07.113
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

00:19:17.698 --> 00:19:21.404
It could not happen earlier,

00:19:23.312 --> 00:19:31.146
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

00:19:37.251 --> 00:19:43.103
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

00:19:43.304 --> 00:19:46.265
that I look like you, I behave like you,

00:19:46.466 --> 00:19:48.352
I have made Myself exactly like you -

00:19:48.553 --> 00:19:52.669
very difficult to make, but I have.

00:20:14.019 --> 00:20:18.029
And this body has to bear lots of things

00:20:18.230 --> 00:20:27.967
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

00:20:38.744 --> 00:20:42.093
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

00:20:42.294 --> 00:20:46.072
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

00:20:46.273 --> 00:20:50.309
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

00:20:50.510 --> 00:20:55.837
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

00:20:56.038 --> 00:20:59.477
and moving very fast.

00:21:12.192 --> 00:21:16.326
Now I have to bear it.

00:21:16.527 --> 00:21:21.636
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

00:21:28.422 --> 00:21:34.261
Because He is very direct,

00:21:36.589 --> 00:21:43.158
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.511
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

00:21:55.712 --> 00:22:03.766
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

00:22:17.983 --> 00:22:22.281
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

00:22:22.490 --> 00:22:26.988
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

00:22:27.204 --> 00:22:31.639
so I take time to take them out.

00:22:47.307 --> 00:22:49.735
So all these things are very symbolic,

00:22:49.936 --> 00:22:54.948
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

00:23:00.526 --> 00:23:05.959
And that symbol actually acts.

00:23:09.488 --> 00:23:12.235
For example if you give somebody a flower,

00:23:12.436 --> 00:23:17.242
that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

00:23:17.443 --> 00:23:21.896
and gratitude comes in.

00:23:30.277 --> 00:23:35.715
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

00:23:35.916 --> 00:23:44.208
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

00:23:56.613 --> 00:24:01.093
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

00:24:01.294 --> 00:24:04.306
and of their blessings on you.

00:24:04.507 --> 00:24:09.313
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

00:24:18.107 --> 00:24:22.144
That is how the Divine acts.

00:24:25.371 --> 00:24:34.204
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

00:24:39.085 --> 00:24:41.552
Now we are doing puja at this time,

00:24:41.753 --> 00:24:45.832
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

00:24:46.033 --> 00:24:53.376
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:11.878
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

00:25:12.079 --> 00:25:14.773
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

00:25:14.974 --> 00:25:20.046
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

00:25:20.247 --> 00:25:23.256
Now they are getting the same blessings,

00:25:23.457 --> 00:25:25.203
though you are doing the puja

00:25:25.404 --> 00:25:30.183
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

00:25:48.056 --> 00:25:56.044
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

00:25:56.245 --> 00:25:59.628
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

00:25:59.829 --> 00:26:04.152
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

00:26:04.353 --> 00:26:09.297
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

00:26:28.146 --> 00:26:31.589
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:37.382
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

00:26:46.345 --> 00:26:49.584
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

00:26:49.785 --> 00:26:55.298
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

00:27:06.774 --> 00:27:14.246
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

00:27:20.204 --> 00:27:24.535
So you should be very relaxed about it.

00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:30.589
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

00:27:32.622 --> 00:27:35.665
May God bless you all.
