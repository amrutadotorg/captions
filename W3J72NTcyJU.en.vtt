00:02.020 --> 00:07.533
Today I will tell you the importance
of puja.

00:10.730 --> 00:14.137
[To the Spanish translator: “You could
take this” (microphone).]

00:28.306 --> 00:39.994
Even among the early Christians,
they used to do the puja

00:40.195 --> 00:52.995
of the adoration to the statues, maybe,

00:53.196 --> 01:03.899
or maybe the photographs, or, we can say,
the stained glass copies

01:04.100 --> 01:07.875
of the Mother and Christ.

01:23.290 --> 01:28.520
But later on, people started becoming
more rational

01:28.721 --> 01:35.086
and they did not understand what is
the importance of puja.

01:41.698 --> 01:45.678
And when they could not explain it,

01:45.879 --> 01:53.638
they gave up doing pujas in that regular
manner.

02:03.603 --> 02:06.802
Even before Christ, they used to have

02:07.003 --> 02:11.386
a particular type of a tabernacle, which
was measured

02:11.587 --> 02:18.577
and was specially made and a puja place
was created to worship –

02:33.195 --> 02:40.338
to worship what they call Yahovah.

02:45.432 --> 02:52.326
Now this Yahovah in our Sahaja Yoga
is Sadashiva,

02:59.175 --> 03:05.150
and Mother Mary is Mahalakshmi.

03:07.174 --> 03:11.903
She incarnated before also.

03:13.763 --> 03:18.521
She incarnated as Sita,

03:20.032 --> 03:26.020
and then She incarnated as Radha,

03:26.339 --> 03:31.647
and then She incarnated as Mother Mary.

03:33.097 --> 03:36.935
Now it is clearly written about the birth
of Christ

03:37.136 --> 03:42.261
in a book called Devi Mahatmyam.

03:50.595 --> 03:56.204
He was the son of Radha.

03:56.718 --> 04:02.488
Radha is the Mahalakshmi,

04:04.798 --> 04:14.264
so He was born in another state, as an egg,

04:17.196 --> 04:21.747
and half of the egg remained
as Shri Ganesha

04:21.948 --> 04:31.003
and half of it became Mahavishnu,
which is our Lord Jesus Christ.

04:40.523 --> 04:44.651
All the description about Jesus Christ

04:44.852 --> 04:52.367
is given in that Mahavishnu’s description,
exactly the same.

05:01.365 --> 05:08.881
Now this Mahalakshmi came on this earth
and She brought forth Her child

05:09.082 --> 05:11.494
with immaculate conception,

05:11.703 --> 05:17.788
which She had done before also, as Radha.

05:33.611 --> 05:44.349
So, the Christ is the son of the great
being of the Virat.

05:50.441 --> 05:57.406
Actually Vishnu, Mahavishnu, Vishnu
becomes the Virata.

06:06.504 --> 06:10.573
Now this Vishnu Tattwa becomes Virata

06:10.774 --> 06:16.686
and also He becomes Rama and Krishna

06:25.131 --> 06:29.810
and then the Virat, means the Akbar.

06:33.544 --> 06:45.639
So Christ is the Omkara itself,
is the vibrations itself.

06:52.124 --> 07:01.144
All other incarnations had to take
the principle

07:01.345 --> 07:06.169
or the essence of the Mother Earth
to create their body,

07:06.370 --> 07:12.587
except for Christ’s body, which is
absolutely Omkara.

07:27.444 --> 07:34.937
And the earth element of that being
is Shri Ganesha.

07:41.954 --> 07:50.842
So we can say that Christ is the power
of Shri Ganesha which incarnated.

07:56.921 --> 08:04.316
So He – that’s the reason He could walk
on the water.

08:07.897 --> 08:13.746
So He is the purest form of Divinity,

08:15.437 --> 08:20.046
because He is just vibrations.

08:22.861 --> 08:30.685
So when you do puja to Me,

08:30.886 --> 08:37.210
because I’m in person, there is nothing
unreal.

08:48.246 --> 08:51.802
If they had done puja to Christ -

08:52.003 --> 08:59.716
they must, they have done puja to Christ
also when He lived and to His Mother.

09:06.336 --> 09:14.128
It is said that in the Ten Commandments
whatever is created by the heavens

09:14.329 --> 09:23.552
and by the earth should not be re-created
and re-produced and worshipped.

09:33.111 --> 09:39.273
So the incarnations are created
by the heavens.

09:45.757 --> 09:54.503
Only in modern times it is possible to take
a photograph of the incarnation.

10:02.960 --> 10:07.922
But in the former days there was
no possibility.

10:12.183 --> 10:17.636
Now whatever is created by the Mother Earth

10:17.837 --> 10:23.088
is what has come out of the Mother Earth,

10:27.365 --> 10:30.867
which is the swayambhu,

10:31.719 --> 10:35.523
is created by the Mother Earth.

10:36.547 --> 10:42.983
Now we have everywhere, we find
the swayambhu things.

10:48.667 --> 10:55.879
Another thing is, some realised souls also
have made beautiful statues.

11:04.175 --> 11:12.744
I went to Portugal and they had a festival
of the Lady of the Rocks.

11:17.840 --> 11:23.367
So I went to see that place

11:23.568 --> 11:31.144
and there was a very small little statue
of this dimension, height of the Mary,

11:31.345 --> 11:35.841
about say, five inches, at the most.

11:42.624 --> 11:46.804
And the face was just like Mine,

11:48.502 --> 11:51.912
exactly like Mine.

11:52.113 --> 11:59.142
And they said that this was found suddenly
by two children

11:59.343 --> 12:07.931
who were following a rabbit which hid
inside a niche.

12:19.898 --> 12:22.472
So these children saw some light
inside the niche

12:22.673 --> 12:28.452
and they started following under a rock,

12:33.260 --> 12:39.963
and they reached the source of the light,
was this statue. They brought it out.

12:44.146 --> 12:45.992
And in that light they walked,

12:46.193 --> 12:49.378
and when the people outside, were lots
of people were gathered,

12:49.579 --> 12:55.552
they were amazed to see that they brought
out the statue from somewhere inside.

13:08.063 --> 13:14.461
So they worship that statue in that place.

13:18.103 --> 13:24.106
Now, these statues give you vibrations,

13:28.247 --> 13:32.065
as I give you vibrations,

13:32.266 --> 13:35.658
but not so much

13:36.071 --> 13:39.226
as I give you.

13:39.901 --> 13:43.444
And all the other statues also, there
may be many,

13:43.645 --> 13:47.584
who might be giving you vibrations.

13:51.050 --> 13:55.218
Also in India, as you know, you went
some of you to Ganapatipule,

13:55.419 --> 13:58.975
where it is the Ganesha which has come -
Mahaganesha, that is Christ -

13:59.176 --> 14:03.623
has come out of the Mother Earth,
Mahaganesha.

14:13.937 --> 14:17.132
So the lower portion of the body
you see there,

14:17.333 --> 14:22.010
and the head is the whole of the mountain.

14:30.021 --> 14:37.121
And there the water of the sea is
also sweet,

14:43.458 --> 14:48.188
and there are many sweet water wells there.

14:50.653 --> 14:53.923
If you remember, a photograph of Mine
was taken there,

14:54.124 --> 14:57.698
many people took photograph.

15:01.537 --> 15:07.764
And in some photographs, in My heart
there’s a light coming out.

15:09.917 --> 15:15.125
And some told Me that some photographs
which did not have the light,

15:15.326 --> 15:25.118
but when they re-took, I mean the negatives
were again taken as a photograph,

15:25.340 --> 15:30.922
and again they took a photograph with that,
then the light came in there.

15:44.354 --> 15:49.371
So, one must know that in the realm
of Divine

15:49.572 --> 15:54.536
there are all kinds of miraculous things.

16:03.970 --> 16:07.423
Same is the puja.

16:07.764 --> 16:15.121
Now when we do the puja, first of all
you will praise Shri Ganesha.

16:18.329 --> 16:26.531
By that, in you, Shri Ganesha will be
awakened and established.

16:33.180 --> 16:39.917
By worshipping Me as Shri Ganesha,
your innocence will be established.

16:47.975 --> 16:50.509
And you will see, the vibration-wise also,

16:50.710 --> 16:59.618
your vibrations will increase and you will
feel very stable within yourself.

17:07.059 --> 17:15.454
Now when you will take Shri Ganesha’s
names you will know what qualities He has,

17:19.354 --> 17:23.113
what powers He gives you.

17:23.712 --> 17:25.929
When you praise those qualities,

17:26.130 --> 17:33.006
those powers of those qualities will
start emitting through you.

17:43.716 --> 17:47.473
This is how the Divine works,

17:49.256 --> 17:54.338
as if you get charged with those qualities.

17:58.345 --> 18:04.649
Then you praise the Goddess, the Adi
Shakti.

18:08.513 --> 18:16.153
Now the Adi Shakti has all the seven
chakras within Her awakened,

18:21.123 --> 18:24.947
and She has to work with all these seven
chakras.

18:25.148 --> 18:30.246
For the first time such an incarnation
has come.

18:35.295 --> 18:37.960
It’s like you make first one room, then
second room,

18:38.160 --> 18:41.519
then third room, seven rooms, and then
the whole house is done,

18:41.720 --> 18:46.090
you get the keys and you open, the house
is yours.

18:59.761 --> 19:07.113
That is how I could achieve Self-
realisation en masse.

19:17.698 --> 19:21.404
It could not happen earlier,

19:23.312 --> 19:31.146
but now possible, because of this
combination of all the seven chakras.

19:37.251 --> 19:43.103
So now when you are praising the Adi
Shakti, I’m also a Mahamaya,

19:43.304 --> 19:46.265
that I look like you, I behave like you,

19:46.466 --> 19:48.352
I have made Myself exactly like you -

19:48.553 --> 19:52.669
very difficult to make, but I have.

20:14.019 --> 20:18.029
And this body has to bear lots of things

20:18.230 --> 20:27.967
to make you understand Sahaja Yoga
and your own powers.

20:38.744 --> 20:42.093
For example, you are - if you are rude
to Me,

20:42.294 --> 20:46.072
if you are not respectful, Christ gets
very angry

20:46.273 --> 20:50.309
because He has said that anything against
Holy Ghost, He won’t tolerate.

20:50.510 --> 20:55.837
So the My chakra, the Agnya starts,
you see, throwing anger,

20:56.038 --> 20:59.477
and moving very fast.

21:12.192 --> 21:16.326
Now I have to bear it.

21:16.527 --> 21:21.636
I cannot tell you the way Christ wants
Me to tell you.

21:28.422 --> 21:34.261
Because He is very direct,

21:36.589 --> 21:43.158
and I have to little bit be careful so that
you don’t get upset.

21:50.320 --> 21:55.511
Moreover, while doing the puja, supposing
you are a doubting type,

21:55.712 --> 22:03.766
or you are opposing it, then you don’t
absorb the vibrations and I have problems,

22:17.983 --> 22:22.281
because the vibrations are flowing and
you are not receiving it.

22:22.490 --> 22:26.988
So I don’t know how to contain within
Myself if you don’t suck in the vibrations,

22:27.204 --> 22:31.639
so I take time to take them out.

22:47.307 --> 22:49.735
So all these things are very symbolic,

22:49.936 --> 22:54.948
whatever we are doing is very symbolic.

23:00.526 --> 23:05.959
And that symbol actually acts.

23:09.488 --> 23:12.235
For example if you give somebody a flower,

23:12.436 --> 23:17.242
that fellow feels, that person feels
extremely joyous and happy,

23:17.443 --> 23:21.896
and gratitude comes in.

23:30.277 --> 23:35.715
So when you offer Me say, flowers
or anything like water or anything,

23:35.916 --> 23:44.208
then the elements are happy and the deities
are happy in the chakras.

23:56.613 --> 24:01.093
And then they emit their vibrations
of their quality

24:01.294 --> 24:04.306
and of their blessings on you.

24:04.507 --> 24:09.313
They give you their quality and their
blessings.

24:18.107 --> 24:22.144
That is how the Divine acts.

24:25.371 --> 24:34.204
And gradually after puja you will feel it,
that the whole thing is working out.

24:39.085 --> 24:41.552
Now we are doing puja at this time,

24:41.753 --> 24:45.832
and all over the world people know
that there’s a puja going on here,

24:46.033 --> 24:53.376
so they are also sitting in meditation and
they also get the blessings.

25:08.030 --> 25:11.878
They are also waiting for this moment
when the puja starts.

25:12.079 --> 25:14.773
So we give them a time like eleven
o’clock or so,

25:14.974 --> 25:20.046
up to eleven o’clock we should sit down
and they start at eleven o’clock.

25:20.247 --> 25:23.256
Now they are getting the same blessings,

25:23.457 --> 25:25.203
though you are doing the puja

25:25.404 --> 25:30.183
but they also get the blessings in their
meditation.

25:48.056 --> 25:56.044
If you are not yet so clever and if you
don’t know all the few things

25:56.245 --> 25:59.628
which are important in the puja, does
not matter.

25:59.829 --> 26:04.152
Because if you are ignorant about it,
innocent about it,

26:04.353 --> 26:09.297
God knows, He forgives, He doesn’t mind.

26:28.146 --> 26:31.589
You should not mind if you commit any
mistakes or anything:

26:31.790 --> 26:37.382
just with a humble heart, do the way
you like.

26:46.345 --> 26:49.584
Gradually, you will learn.
But if you know

26:49.785 --> 26:55.298
and then you deliberately make mistakes,
then it’s not good.

27:06.774 --> 27:14.246
As we forgive our children, God also
forgives innocent children.

27:20.204 --> 27:24.535
So you should be very relaxed about it.

27:25.948 --> 27:30.589
And just do it for the joy of your heart.

27:32.622 --> 27:35.665
May God bless you all.
