1
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:24,900
So, thank you very much for the greetings
on this day. It was a Easter Monday when I

2
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:07,519
got married that day, and also My baptism
took place on Easter Monday. But you know

3
00:01:08,510 --> 00:01:14,820
our Easter Monday always changes according
to the Monday it comes.

4
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:21,820
So it was quite a big venture for Me to marry.
Actually, I did not need it at all. But as

5
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:36,730
you know in India, they won't spare any girl
from marriage, and they have been after My

6
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:43,730
life since I was about eighteen years of age.
So somehow I managed. But I was in the medical

7
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:50,820
college Lahore, and suddenly the disturbances
broke out there, of a very serious nature.

8
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,790
And I came back, and there was no possibility
of My going back. Then the whole thing -- planned,

9
00:01:58,790 --> 00:02:05,790
I think Divine planned it for My marriage,
because I had to accept them. And as My husband

10
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,840
was there, there were many proposals also,
which they chose this one, and I was married.

11
00:02:14,799 --> 00:02:20,390
In a way arranged, because I had never talked
to him about it, he had not talked to Me,

12
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:27,390
but he had seen Me once before.
So, for Me it was all right because everybody's

13
00:02:30,719 --> 00:02:37,719
so much worried in My family about My marriage
all the time. But all throughout I feel that

14
00:02:41,150 --> 00:02:46,489
I looked after My husband's relations, family,
though he had none. He had only one sister

15
00:02:46,489 --> 00:02:53,489
whose grandson is Vinay. And all the rest
of the family, all those relations of his,

16
00:02:54,739 --> 00:03:00,849
I really looked after them. And he was counting,
he said, "You have looked after thirty-five

17
00:03:00,849 --> 00:03:07,849
nephews," only nephews and how many nieces
and how many ... Because it was nature, you

18
00:03:09,669 --> 00:03:16,209
see, of compassion, which all they were this
time, worried about all these people.

19
00:03:16,209 --> 00:03:23,209
My mother's family was always well off. They
didn't need any help anywhere. These people

20
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:30,819
were big landlords, once upon a time, all
My husband's relationship, and suddenly this

21
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:38,069
was removed, all landlordship was removed
from them, suddenly. And they became absolutely

22
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:44,329
lost, their children became lost, you see,
because they were used to such luxuries, this,

23
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:51,329
that, and they had silver, gold, everything.
And as soon as they lost their lands, they

24
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:02,669
lost, only fifty acres were allowed for every
family. So they had to sell out all their

25
00:04:02,669 --> 00:04:09,669
silvers and everything, and they had to be
really adjusted now to a much poorer strata.

26
00:04:11,279 --> 00:04:18,279
The whole situation came as a very big shock
to all of us, and it was My husband only who

27
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,900
was well placed in life because he had never
bothered about his lands and things. So he

28
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:31,970
was well placed, he was in the government.
So I took the responsibility of all these

29
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:38,970
people and tried to help them in their education,
in their finding jobs and things like that.

30
00:04:41,669 --> 00:04:47,150
It's all worked, and they are all very well
off now. So very happy to see them. They all

31
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:54,150
came for the wedding of My granddaughter,
and also of My daughters, and showed their

32
00:04:55,639 --> 00:05:01,879
gratitude. Out of them very few have come
to Sahaja Yoga. Actually, the relations are

33
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:08,169
always like that. They are so close that I
tell them there's a black point, you know,

34
00:05:08,169 --> 00:05:12,960
where everything dissolves into zero. So they
are so close that they cannot see what is

35
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,360
Sahaja Yoga. They have tremendous regard for
Me. They have tremendous respect for Me. They'll

36
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,840
do anything, specially My husband has spent
lot of money in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga,

37
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:29,720
quite a lot. And doesn't ask for it; or never
mentioned it also. And we have spent so much

38
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,720
of his money because we had a joint account;
he never questioned Me, nothing of the kind.

39
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:49,870
Very sweet of him. [Suddenly it comes up,
I don't know why. I've been talking too much.]

40
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:05,270
So the situation is better now. They have
faith in Sahaja Yoga. They try to meditate

41
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:12,789
also. But they are not seekers, in a way,
because they are so close to Me. As you people

42
00:06:12,789 --> 00:06:19,789
have an advantage, great advantage you have
-- that firstly you are seekers from ages,

43
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:29,599
and you understand how important it is to
get your Self-realization, because you feel

44
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,939
lost without it. You think that if you don't
get your Self-realization, you should commit

45
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:40,729
suicide, and there are many letters I have
got saying that "We were mad. We were seeking,

46
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:46,530
going to this person, going to that person."
Such big, big letters I got from them how

47
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:50,919
they were cheated, how they were tortured,
and how they were ... spent money and how

48
00:06:50,919 --> 00:06:57,919
they were completely lynched by these gurus.
Some of them had to sell their houses, and

49
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:06,400
children were removed from schools, and everybody
became extremely poor. So this was in London

50
00:07:07,689 --> 00:07:14,080
much worse. Later on I found that every country
has this problem, they became drug addicts

51
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:21,080
and all that.
Despite all that now we have so many people

52
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:27,740
who are Sahaja yogis all over the world, not
only in Australia. But Australia has quite

53
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:34,740
a lot of Sahaja yogis, I must say. And quantity
is very, very large and good, and people are

54
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:43,030
nice, but we have had, as I told you, a very
bumpy start. Because of that, certain conditionings

55
00:07:43,979 --> 00:07:50,979
are built up in people. But now we have to
see that our quality has to improve. Quality

56
00:07:53,280 --> 00:08:00,280
has to improve, and the test of quality, I
think, is that they are very anxious to do

57
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:10,199
whatever is possible for Sahaja Yoga. Whenever
it's possible, whatever is possible, they

58
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:17,199
are anxious to do it. And also, they run a
very good family, children, household. This

59
00:08:22,099 --> 00:08:29,099
is the sign that you have really developed
in Sahaja Yoga. But if that is not so, then

60
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:35,740
you will never enjoy the progress Sahaja Yoga
is making.

61
00:08:35,740 --> 00:08:40,909
I have seen people, one person can give realization
to one thousand. But there's one person who

62
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:45,040
has been in Sahaja Yoga, say, about twenty
years, has not given realization to even one

63
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:52,040
person. So we have two types, two extremes,
I should -- two extremes, from one to another.

64
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,760
Now some people believe that they are very
old Sahaja yogis. This is another mistake

65
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,090
we commit. They believe, "We are the senior."
There's nothing like seniority, juniority

66
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:08,850
in Sahaja Yoga. I find sometimes very new
people are such great Sahaja yogis. Very new.

67
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:15,850
They just go down, absolutely, into the essence
of themselves and of Sahaja Yoga. Maybe their

68
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:26,120
previous lives must have been so great, possibly,
or maybe this life they have achieved something

69
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:33,920
great maybe from the parents or from somebody.
But some of them are really very, very deep.

70
00:09:40,060 --> 00:09:46,890
One of the things I have seen in, mostly in
Sahaja Yoga, that they are more concerned

71
00:09:46,890 --> 00:09:53,890
about themselves, about their families, about
their children, at the most. But look at Me,

72
00:09:55,810 --> 00:10:01,200
I'm not ... I never bother about My health.
If anybody asks Me, "How are You?" I said,

73
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:07,970
"I am first class." I never bother about Myself
for anything, for My comfort, or for anything,

74
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:14,970
food, anything. I have no sense at all to
divert My attention inward. But if somebody

75
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:23,000
else, say, is in trouble or has something,
I just, just feel I must help that person.

76
00:10:25,630 --> 00:10:31,820
I must do something about him, I'm very concerned.
Sometimes also, My family people said that

77
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:37,070
"Even if You have one thousand concerns that
You have for others, You'll be better off."

78
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:44,070
But that's why nothing, nothing can harm Me
because I am always worried about your progress,

79
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:54,700
about your problems, about your quarrels and
fights, and this and that. It's such a tremendous

80
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:06,630
concern it is, such a full-throated, you can
say -- absolutely all My attention just goes

81
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:15,760
focused on these problems.
As soon as I see person, I know what the problem

82
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:22,760
the person has, why is he not progressing,
what is the problem he has with others. Everything

83
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:31,620
I know in no time. But even if I know, I need
not bother; but I really get very much bothered

84
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:41,620
about them, as if -- they are, as it is you
know, part and parcel of My body -- but the

85
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:48,620
amount I worry about them, sometimes. People
have always remarked about Me sometimes that

86
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:57,720
"Mother, You need not worry so much about
them. Why are You worried? Let them go to

87
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:04,720
hell. Let them." If you have once called Me
"Mother," then I really forgive. I've forgiven

88
00:12:04,990 --> 00:12:10,630
all the people who have troubled Me and have
insulted Me, and given trouble in Sahaja Yoga.

89
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:17,630
I've forgiven all of them. I have no time
to worry about not forgiving.

90
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:26,080
I should be an example for you, for you to
understand that the more attention we pay

91
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:34,660
to others, not finding their faults or criticizing
them, but doing things for others; small,

92
00:12:35,050 --> 00:12:42,050
small nice things if you start doing for others,
immediately, you will be surprised, your attention

93
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:49,380
will sharpen. It will have a very great effect.
Sahaja Yoga will spread through you and you

94
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:57,400
will, yourself, will be very different person.
You won't criticize other Sahaja yogis, you

95
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:02,490
won't criticize this, that. I mean fundamental
things, if there's something wrong, you have

96
00:13:02,490 --> 00:13:09,490
to tell Me. That's different. But that seldom
people tell Me. So first we must extend our

97
00:13:12,450 --> 00:13:19,450
attention outside, towards others, not towards
ourselves. Then the same about our children,

98
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:25,050
our house, our this, that. Just extend your
attention outside.

99
00:13:25,050 --> 00:13:32,050
Now see, I am a housewife. The last twenty-four
years I have been traveling. And in a way

100
00:13:35,450 --> 00:13:42,430
you can say I am neglecting My family. But
if you ask My family people, they'll say -- today

101
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:49,430
they telephoned to Me to thank Me that I have
completely built up this family. I don't know

102
00:13:50,060 --> 00:13:57,060
when did I give time to them, but they feel
that way, very much. And everybody thanked

103
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:04,650
Me, every one of them said, "This family has
been built up only by You, without You nothing

104
00:14:04,650 --> 00:14:11,650
could have been possible." Because of My attention
outside is so easy to work out anything that

105
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:19,850
is needed to be done. Whatever needed to be
done is done.

106
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:26,850
I'll give an example. You may call it a miracle.
My grandson wanted to go to a university,

107
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:35,820
good university in America. But they said,
"You have to appear for SAT, and after that

108
00:14:36,020 --> 00:14:41,720
only we'll admit," and he would lose one year
for that. I didn't want him to go to America

109
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:48,460
before doing SAT, because I thought that,
see for six, seven days he goes there, he

110
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:55,460
won't be able to do much. And we left it at
that. All right, he was preparing for SAT.

111
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:02,890
I had told one Sahaja yogi there, Paul, that
"You see if you can help us." But nobody would

112
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,080
talk to him in the university, when he went
there, they wouldn't even say if they have

113
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:13,080
received the form of My grandson.
The other day they rang up to say that he's

114
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:20,810
got admission already. How? God knows. The
information has come that he's got admission.

115
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:29,080
Nobody in America can be admitted without
SAT exams. Without any condition he got admission,

116
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:37,580
and they told Me.
I said, "Maybe Paul must have done something."

117
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:42,770
So I telephoned to Paul. He said, "Mother
I did not go to that university. I didn't

118
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:49,350
ask anybody, they wouldn't talk to me. They
said you better not ring here, get lost."

119
00:15:49,350 --> 00:15:56,350
And somehow, they don't know how, they admitted
him. And he was a last minute person who sent

120
00:15:59,790 --> 00:16:03,620
the form to this.
But only thing, one thing had happened, he

121
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:10,360
told Me that "If I don't get admission in
a good university, I will not go to America.

122
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:17,360
It's too much waste of money." Very wise boy.
I said, "All right." That's the only time

123
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:24,690
I gave bandhan. And see now, he's got his
admission. His elder sister also got admission

124
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:32,700
in John Hopkins Institute without any condition.
Though when she went there, she found the

125
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:36,590
atmosphere was no good for her, she ran away.
But on the whole, that unconditional, they

126
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:40,160
are saying, Gregoire told Me, "Mother, not
possible. How can she get it?"

127
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,160
I said, "There's a letter." Without putting
any pressure, without doing anything, it happens.

128
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:56,540
It's a miracle. I must say it's a miracle.
But something works, and that is this all-pervading

129
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:06,260
power.
With one idea if you go about, it will not

130
00:17:09,689 --> 00:17:15,650
help you. If you want ... Someone said, "Mother,
we wanted to get this house, we couldn't get

131
00:17:15,650 --> 00:17:22,280
it." Because you had only one idea, to get
the house. But if you had the whole idea that

132
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:29,280
if we get the house, then we'll do these things,
we can work it out better, this, that, then

133
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:36,870
you get it. So, you should project yourself
towards other things which are more important

134
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:48,090
than yourself. Then suddenly you will start
growing. It's like some trees grow higher,

135
00:17:49,310 --> 00:17:56,310
some do not. Why? Because they aspire the
sun's light and they want to be more nearer

136
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:06,240
to sun. But that's not possible, you cannot
be nearer the sun by just growing few feet.

137
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:13,240
But they aspire. So they are taller than others.
In the same group, you'll find, some trees

138
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:20,610
grow taller, some don't.
So, one aspect is that you have to meditate,

139
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:34,540
no doubt. So, one thing is to develop quality
you have to meditate. That I said. But you

140
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:49,800
must know what is your problem. You are right-sided
or left-sided. It's very important to know

141
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:56,100
whether you are right-sided or left-sided.
Now some people have problems which are left-sided.

142
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:03,100
All right, they start doing water treatment.
There was doctor in Delhi, Dr. Nigam, you

143
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:23,350
must be knowing him. He had, I had cured his
paralysis. I was surprised that his left hand

144
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:30,450
was still not working out properly.
So I asked him, "What sort of a meditation

145
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:36,420
you do?"
He said, "With the light and with the water."

146
00:19:36,420 --> 00:19:41,510
I said, "What? You are doing both?"
"Yes."

147
00:19:41,510 --> 00:19:48,510
I said, "What, what's wrong with you is right
side [Shri Mataji corrects] -- left side.

148
00:19:48,670 --> 00:19:54,850
So you should just do candle treatment. Just
drop it." I said it to him. Just when I said

149
00:19:54,850 --> 00:20:01,540
it to him, his hand started opening out. I
said it only; becomes like a mantra I think.

150
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:06,770
Started opening, he has opened his hand.
So about treatment also you must understand

151
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:13,270
what treatment you must take. Now some people
are left-sided. They should take left side

152
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:19,730
treatment only. There should be no confusion.
So I said, "Who told you this?"

153
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:24,420
He said, "Everybody said the same thing."
I said, "What did they say?"

154
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:31,410
"That you can take this."
In Sahaja Yoga there are certain rules and

155
00:20:31,410 --> 00:20:36,150
regulations of the Divine. So now if you are
suffering from the left, you just take treatment

156
00:20:36,150 --> 00:20:43,150
for left. No water treatment, at all. Now
you are suffering from the right, then don't

157
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:49,559
take the candle treatment at all, at all.
These are two sides which are to be corrected,

158
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:54,780
then you are in the center.
When you feel you are in center, you can use

159
00:20:54,780 --> 00:21:01,780
both the things. But that is normally very
few, I've seen. Normally you find very few

160
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:09,910
people who have this central point. If they
have, they should do this treatment. But there

161
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:15,340
is no need to do treatment once you are in
the center. But you have to meditate. So you

162
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:20,950
can sit before the photograph. But to take
out all your conditionings and things, or

163
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:27,950
may be the day's problem, you can sit before
the photograph with a candle as well as water.

164
00:21:28,490 --> 00:21:35,490
But the ones who are not, should not. And
one should not feel also bad if the leaders

165
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:44,410
tell them, "You are left-sided or right-sided."
The problem is that in Sahaja Yoga there are

166
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:52,360
leaders. It's a myth. It's a myth. It's not
something so seriously to be taken. But these

167
00:21:53,710 --> 00:22:00,710
leaders are there because I cannot communicate
with all of you. So, they are there. When

168
00:22:01,940 --> 00:22:08,940
it came to talk about the leaders, nobody
told Me anything. Very surprising. Never they

169
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:17,420
told Me the leaders are doing like this. I
had to discover it every time I came here.

170
00:22:18,180 --> 00:22:23,570
You should have written to Me earlier that
our leader is like this or it's happening

171
00:22:23,570 --> 00:22:30,570
here. There's no harm in writing that. But
they did not, none of them. Till I came here,

172
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:35,710
I discovered the kind of people they were.
Actually, they dis ... I discovered them only

173
00:22:35,710 --> 00:22:41,760
in Europe. I did not know that they were doing
all these things.

174
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:48,760
Then they were developing also some funds
and raising some sort of a money, nobody told

175
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:57,160
Me. Even when they came to India they collected
money. But nobody told Me that they were collecting

176
00:22:57,580 --> 00:23:03,180
money for this or that. I mean, at least you
should have told Me. Somebody should have

177
00:23:03,180 --> 00:23:10,180
told Me. That's how they became sort of absolutely
fascists. They thought, "We are the lords,

178
00:23:11,290 --> 00:23:17,120
we can do whatever we like." But for other
nonsensical things they'll write such letters,

179
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:20,360
but never about something which is very, very
good, essential and needed. And anybody who

180
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:20,820
writes Me like that, I'm very much thankful
to that person. Not just to criticize but

181
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,880
to give exact trouble, or exact problem that
is facing. I'll be very happy if you people

182
00:23:21,880 --> 00:23:23,240
write to Me truthfully, not what is troubling
you, but what is troubling everyone. So I

183
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:30,240
can solve the problem much better, isn't it?
Now the another thing we had to tell about,

184
00:23:31,690 --> 00:23:38,690
that what should be the relationships of husband
and wife. Now I've already had many occasions

185
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:49,100
to talk to them. Now you are married by Me.
It was not such an arranged ma ... arranged

186
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:56,120
marriage, you were given time to find out
till the end. And even if you did not like

187
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,679
the person, you could have told Me and we
would have finished the marriage. But even

188
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,679
when it is registered, you've stayed with
the lady for so many years, or with the man

189
00:24:08,750 --> 00:24:14,130
for so many years, you have had children and
after that suddenly you come up that "Mother

190
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:21,130
we cannot cope." But this is going too far
with yourself and with the whole society of

191
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:28,800
Sahaja Yoga. If you don't like somebody, if
there's a problem you should find out in the

192
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:35,800
beginning. I'll be the last person to force
you to marry anyone. Even if you are married,

193
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:43,059
and just after say three, four months you
let Me know, the marriage can be broken. And

194
00:24:43,059 --> 00:24:50,059
I have told Yogi now not to register them
for about three months and see for yourself.

195
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:57,040
Now you must understand that marriage is not
an institution well-practiced in the West.

196
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:03,900
Till they are married, they are happy. As
soon as they are married there's something

197
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:09,790
goes wrong in their heads. Maybe the reason
is there's a legal bondage in the marriage.

198
00:25:09,790 --> 00:25:14,530
If you are married to somebody, you see, your
money will be shared or anything, that kind

199
00:25:14,530 --> 00:25:21,530
of a fear is there. For the same reason I
have asked so many times that you don't get

200
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:29,880
married to somebody till you are normal. But
many people who are sick, have diseases, have

201
00:25:33,160 --> 00:25:40,160
problems, have some sort of funny ideas, just
they marry, as the Americans say, for the

202
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:50,420
heck of it. And then it's such a troublesome
thing for Me. Firstly I get concerned, secondly

203
00:25:55,460 --> 00:26:02,460
it's a very bad example for other Sahaja yogis,
and brings a bad name for all of us.

204
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:12,040
It's not difficult to enjoy your marriage
because mostly we really examine and find

205
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:19,040
out properly what's the matter with what,
and who is capable of carrying on with whom.

206
00:26:21,970 --> 00:26:28,970
We, we try our level best, but there are sometimes
four hundred, five hundred applications of

207
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:38,540
various types. Sometimes you do miss, do miss
certain points. But you people can understand

208
00:26:42,910 --> 00:26:49,910
that, sometimes, and you should try to help
Me by understanding that what is it after

209
00:26:55,960 --> 00:27:02,960
all? What is so important?
There was a Sahaja yogi, very good Sahaja

210
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:10,070
yogi from England. He had a wife who was really
beautiful wife, very well educated, this,

211
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:15,820
that, very smart. He came to Me, he said,
"Mother I want absolutely to divorce this

212
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:19,380
woman."
I said, "Why? She is so good looking."

213
00:27:19,380 --> 00:27:26,380
He said, "No I don't want. I want to divorce."
He was after Me. Then I talked to her. She

214
00:27:26,890 --> 00:27:30,670
said, "I also want to divorce."
"All right, divorce. Divorce is allowed in

215
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:37,670
Sahaja Yoga." So they divorced each other.
Then, we were showing him different photographs

216
00:27:38,670 --> 00:27:44,650
and things that "Now tell Me, which one would
you like to marry?" So he chose a girl who

217
00:27:44,650 --> 00:27:51,650
is not well educated, who is not by any means
good looking. She is very dark with very thick

218
00:27:54,470 --> 00:28:01,470
lips and all that. But I love her very much.
I like her very much. She is very lovable

219
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:08,790
person, extremely sweet. So, he chose her.
I was surprised.

220
00:28:08,790 --> 00:28:13,059
I said, "What?"
"Yes Mother. See her vibrations."

221
00:28:13,059 --> 00:28:20,059
Still I said, "You see her first."
So when we went to Ganapatipule, "Yes," he

222
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:25,980
said. "This is the one I want to marry." I
was surprised, you see, with all that how

223
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:32,600
could he say that "I want to marry this girl"?
I said, "Be sure."

224
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:39,600
"Yes, yes, I'm very sure, I want to marry."
What he told Me that "She's tranquility personified.

225
00:28:41,049 --> 00:28:48,049
I feel so tranquil." She is full of vibrations,
like bag of vibrations. I know that. But I

226
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,390
didn't know how this fellow has felt it. He
has just fallen in love with her, I tell you.

227
00:28:55,390 --> 00:29:01,890
And he says, "She is the most beautiful person
I have met." He doesn't see anything else

228
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:08,890
that is outside. Later on My own sister said,
"What have You done? What a match!"

229
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:16,850
So I looked at that girl, and then I started
seeing these points that she's not good looking,

230
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:24,200
she's not this, but what he said -- she's
tranquility. She is just tranquility. He went

231
00:29:24,450 --> 00:29:31,170
to her village all the way, and he met all
his family and everybody was surprised, such

232
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:38,170
a handsome looking Englishman of all the things.
And she said [Shri Mataji corrects] he said,

233
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:46,320
"Mother, she has neutralized all my nonsensical
points. She's so beautiful." And he's really

234
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:54,580
in love with her.
So that is a sign of a very deep Sahaja yogi

235
00:29:54,670 --> 00:30:01,670
that they don't go after superficial things.
She cooks South Indian food, he loves it.

236
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:09,900
Whatever she does he loves. He cares for her
very much. And she is neither left-sided,

237
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,520
nor right-sided, she is in the center. So
both of them match each other because spiritually

238
00:30:19,950 --> 00:30:26,950
they are on the same level, very deep, and
that is what we have to be. If we are not

239
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:36,980
spiritually matched, then the problem comes
in. We have to have proper matching of vibrations.

240
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:44,120
Of course, we see to it when we marry, I mean
can you imagine, ninety-nine percent marriages

241
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:51,120
have been successful. And some of the marriages
were mischievously done I know, there were

242
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:58,140
some mischiefs. But still they have worked
out. Still they are happy people. But some

243
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:11,500
people are bent upon making their marriage
a problem. Some of them, extremely egoistical,

244
00:31:11,620 --> 00:31:18,620
think no end of themselves, and start making
everybody miserable. What makes them so much

245
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:28,580
full of ego, I don't know. And they just spoil
their marriages. They become unhappy themselves,

246
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:37,950
and they make others also unhappy. Now My
husband has never been a Sahaja yogi, never.

247
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:47,880
Even now, I wouldn't say he is a Sahaja yogi.
Even now. I don't know. But I knew how to

248
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:55,740
handle him and how to work it out. And I've
managed very well, and he also knows. Always

249
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:04,919
he says, "You are very moral person; You are
a very noble person." All those things he

250
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:15,230
says to Me. And all, you see, his saying is
like this that "You are, but You cannot make

251
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:20,840
others."
I said, "I can, why not?"

252
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:27,840
First he could not believe that I could transform
people. And now he knows I have transformed.

253
00:32:28,419 --> 00:32:35,419
He said, "They have become angels." And so
that you are now angels.

254
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:43,330
I am not very happy with the crèche you have
here, not at all. It's a mess. And I don't

255
00:32:45,179 --> 00:32:52,179
know but it's a -- the children coming out
of this school are racist. Very racial ideas

256
00:32:53,090 --> 00:33:00,090
they have, that's the report Yogi gave Me.
Not about Rome. It is so. So I would say we

257
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:09,190
should teach, change the teachers, is the
best way. And the children are very aggressive

258
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:16,190
when they come, very harsh. I would say, put
some Indian teachers there instead of some

259
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:21,690
Western teachers. Maybe they are racist or
maybe something wrong there. This is the report

260
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:28,320
I have got about your children, Australian
children create more problems, and it's very

261
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:35,320
difficult, and they are racist. But there
are hardly any Indian children there, you

262
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:42,450
see. But if there's one even, they aggress.
There are, I think, only three children who

263
00:33:43,470 --> 00:33:50,470
I think are Indians only, or one may be a
Negro, I don't know. But all these children

264
00:33:51,730 --> 00:33:58,260
just jump on them when they go from here.
Takes time to change their ideas.

265
00:33:58,260 --> 00:34:03,120
If you are racist you cannot be in Sahaja
Yoga, you understand that. We don't believe

266
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:07,880
in race and religion and all these things
which are separating human beings from one

267
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:14,880
to another. That is our ideal, that we cannot
have this kind of a nonsense in our society.

268
00:34:18,869 --> 00:34:25,730
And be careful. Watch your children, how they
react to black people. Specially for Australian

269
00:34:25,730 --> 00:34:32,659
children it is being pointed out. So I think
there's something wrong with some people here.

270
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:39,659
They should just try to find out if we are
by any chance trying to teach them that white

271
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:47,989
skin is better than the black.
As I told you in the lecture, I hope you have

272
00:34:48,549 --> 00:34:55,549
listened to what I said about the genes. That
it is now found out that two protective genes

273
00:34:56,789 --> 00:35:03,789
that Asians have the white skin don't have
at all. One of them is the right side, another

274
00:35:05,930 --> 00:35:12,930
the left side. So a white skin will take to
a violence much more easily than an Asian.

275
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:22,839
Asian actually means now Indians and Chinese.
Culturally they are the same. Now that means,

276
00:35:25,479 --> 00:35:31,690
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, your genes have
been transformed, and you have protective

277
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:38,690
genes within you. And one of them is, as I
told you, is the right-sided, hate people

278
00:35:40,999 --> 00:35:46,900
and kill people, be violent, this racialism,
which is now coming back again because they

279
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:53,900
 will take to it easily because there's no
protection against it. Now you can see in

280
00:35:53,910 --> 00:36:00,910
My own family, we had eleven children. Some
were fair, very fair; some were dark. We never

281
00:36:02,069 --> 00:36:08,920
knew what is racialism is because the skin
is so, I mean, is skin deep as they say.

282
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:15,920
So, you see, the ...you are now confronted,
you must understand that, with these two horrible

283
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:22,049
genes, by which, one that will take you to
violence, take you to temper, will take you

284
00:36:22,049 --> 00:36:29,049
to this kind of racialism and hatred and fundamentalism
and the another one is indulgences, laziness

285
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:38,819
or serious things like sex and this and that,
and all these habits you develop of drugs.

286
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:48,920
So you have to be very careful now. By just
announcing that, Germans announced that "We

287
00:36:50,779 --> 00:36:56,319
are a white race," you see, "we are higher
than anyone." How are they higher? Just imagine.

288
00:36:56,319 --> 00:37:03,319
They killed little, little children, small
little children into a gas chamber and saw

289
00:37:03,799 --> 00:37:09,329
them being burnt. Can you imagine anybody
who is a evolved soul, or who is a higher

290
00:37:09,329 --> 00:37:16,329
race, will do such a nasty thing like that?
But this is ... they have sort of self-proportioned

291
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:28,900
values and virtues, which they don't have.
They were so horrible that they took the fat

292
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:41,430
from the dead bodies in Poland, Warsaw, and
they had bath with it. Like a soap, they used.

293
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:54,599
So grotesque. Whole thing is so horrifying.
And they think they are very, very great races.

294
00:37:55,269 --> 00:38:00,619
Even Max Muller wrote like that, you see.
He said it's the Germans who came to India

295
00:38:00,619 --> 00:38:07,619
and wrote Vedas. Their forefathers cannot
write Vedas.

296
00:38:09,019 --> 00:38:14,900
So now try to understand that what we are
facing basically. What I feel, in the arrogance

297
00:38:14,900 --> 00:38:21,900
of this white skin, these people crossed over
their limitations, their maryadas -- the forefathers.

298
00:38:24,650 --> 00:38:31,650
Like the way the Spanish went to America.
You can't find one aboriginal person there,

299
00:38:33,349 --> 00:38:40,349
not one. I wanted to see in Chile, in Argentina,
in Brazil, not even one. Where are they lost?

300
00:38:41,170 --> 00:38:48,170
They all went to the hills and some of them
are preserved in Bolivia and all that. And

301
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:57,190
the revenge has started. From Bolivia all
these horrible drugs are coming. And the whole

302
00:38:59,630 --> 00:39:06,630
of America is just crushed with that. There's
no wisdom, just to think you have fair skin.

303
00:39:11,329 --> 00:39:18,150
All right, go ahead. Where are you going?
You see these. What about the Americans? Where

304
00:39:18,150 --> 00:39:25,150
are they going? Now they are concerned, little
bit. But sixty-five percent people may get

305
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:33,430
schizophrenia in that country. Now how can
you be satisfied with yourself when you see

306
00:39:34,049 --> 00:39:39,479
all these things happening, because you have
just a white skin?

307
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:46,479
So first thing you must try to understand
that even if there's a trace of racialism

308
00:39:49,759 --> 00:39:56,759
in you, better throw it away. On the contrary,
I think this country has really, real justice

309
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:06,970
for racists. Justice-wise you must say Australians
know to be really a multicultural society,

310
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:13,970
and they understand the value of it: what
you have gained through multicultural societies.

311
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:25,359
There's so many things to be learned, that
they are very clean, outside, not in personal

312
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:30,739
life. They'll keep the house very clean, the
carpets very clean, everything very clean,

313
00:40:30,739 --> 00:40:36,170
but as far as themselves are concerned, they
are not so clean. Of course, now with Sahaja

314
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:41,460
Yoga you are changed, I am not saying.
But I know of English people, they would not

315
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:48,460
take bath for months, months, they used to
smell like hell. And when My husband was there

316
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:55,400
we used to shake hands, and the hands would
smell for days together. We used to put scent,

317
00:40:55,400 --> 00:41:01,719
attar, this, that, but still. Using paper,
paper, it's all right because it is very cold,

318
00:41:01,719 --> 00:41:08,719
but it's not that cold. We have lived in England
for so many years. We always use water and

319
00:41:10,529 --> 00:41:17,529
running water. In the same tub, three, four
people take bath, to save pounds. The only

320
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:24,700
mantra they know is "save pounds". Same here,
people are extremely money-oriented when they

321
00:41:26,109 --> 00:41:33,109
have so much money compared to others. So,
for Sahaja yogis, is important that you should

322
00:41:38,180 --> 00:41:45,180
be frugal and you should not be miserly. You
need not. But you should be clean inside.

323
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:52,670
That's very important, not outside so much
because see all these diseases are coming,

324
00:41:52,670 --> 00:41:56,589
these things are coming, one has to be very
careful.

325
00:41:56,589 --> 00:42:02,059
Secondly, you are so protective of yourself,
I mean you are always thinking about yourself.

326
00:42:02,059 --> 00:42:08,749
Extremely protective. So you do not develop
any immunity to anything. If you have to travel

327
00:42:08,749 --> 00:42:13,269
like Me, you would get sick within one month's
time. Firstly you can't eat anything, you

328
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:19,869
get hepatitis. If you smell something you
get hay fever. You do that, I mean all these

329
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:26,430
things are coming because of over-protectiveness.
You must make your children to play in sand;

330
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:33,430
you must make them go about. No -- so protective
of your children! So when they grow they cannot

331
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:41,380
stand anything which is absolutely not completely,
we can say, covered. But Indians don't get

332
00:42:47,249 --> 00:42:54,249
it. We are full of parasites, full of mosquitoes,
full of this. Australian children, when they

333
00:42:54,259 --> 00:43:01,259
got bitten by mosquitoes, they got malaria.
But the whole city was there, nobody got malaria.

334
00:43:01,900 --> 00:43:07,880
Not one person. Now they were surprised, how
is it these boys and girls have got malaria?

335
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:14,880
So in childhood, we should not make our children
sort of all the time extremely delicate. You

336
00:43:16,829 --> 00:43:23,829
look all right. I mean, might have good muscles
to look at. But you are very, very vulnerable

337
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,249
to any disease. You can see from your children.
I'm not saying about Australians. All the

338
00:43:33,249 --> 00:43:40,249
people from the West, whether they are Americans
or they are Europeans or they are this. But

339
00:43:41,339 --> 00:43:48,339
I've seen Russia, people are very, very good.
They don't catch much. They don't suffer from

340
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:55,940
all this.
So this over-protectiveness, and also there

341
00:43:55,940 --> 00:44:01,160
are books and books. Today they'll write a
book about children, "You must give them feed

342
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:07,269
at the right time." Then they will write next
time, "No, no you should not do that way.

343
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:13,960
You should allow them to eat whatever they
like." Then thirdly they'll say that "You

344
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:17,170
should not give this to your children, that
you should not give, that should not happen."

345
00:44:17,170 --> 00:44:24,170
With all this knowledge, people are not aware
that they are making their children like the

346
00:44:28,019 --> 00:44:34,920
dolls in the hands of these writers. Whatever
they say, whatever they do, there's no sense

347
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:41,549
in it. We know what is needed for the children
in Sahaja Yoga. Actually these are people

348
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:45,200
just selling their books, you know, whatever
knowledge they have, they have a flair to

349
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:52,200
write, they write it and you accept it and
you get into problems. And this is a very,

350
00:44:52,499 --> 00:44:59,489
very common thing. They protect the children
too much which they need not. But whenever

351
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:06,489
it is necessary one should.
My main thing is that before the children

352
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:14,420
how we should behave. There are differences
in husband and wife, not that there are none.

353
00:45:15,339 --> 00:45:22,289
But they should not be exposed. Children should
not be exposed to your differences, to your

354
00:45:22,289 --> 00:45:28,289
fights, to your angers and fits. They get
it; they are so, I am again saying, they are

355
00:45:28,289 --> 00:45:35,289
so protected. So much protection is given
to them. These protected children take these

356
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:42,940
things very quickly. If mother says to the
father something, father says to the mother,

357
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:50,710
they'll repeat it later on. You will be surprised,
same thing. When the father does something,

358
00:45:50,710 --> 00:45:57,710
they'll say same thing. So you are spoiling
their whole attitude towards life. Must understand,

359
00:46:00,160 --> 00:46:07,160
children are much faster than you are in picking
up things because they have to learn, they

360
00:46:11,779 --> 00:46:17,150
are growing up.
So your relationship between you and your

361
00:46:17,150 --> 00:46:24,150
wife should be of respect, should be of love
and understanding and caring. But there should

362
00:46:29,519 --> 00:46:36,519
not be something of ... some sort of a scene
that is not good for them. I mean, that doesn't

363
00:46:42,469 --> 00:46:49,229
mean that you behave in a funny manner before
the children. That is for the bedroom, all

364
00:46:49,229 --> 00:46:55,259
right? Thank God, you have bedrooms separate.
We don't even have that. In India, very few

365
00:46:55,259 --> 00:47:02,259
people have bedrooms closed. In the day time,
if they close bedrooms, people think, "Are

366
00:47:02,749 --> 00:47:09,749
they mad or sick?" So this is the attitude
that one has to take that before others, before

367
00:47:10,969 --> 00:47:17,969
other people, before the children and everything,
we have to behave. Now if you want to find

368
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:26,380
faults with each other, you can find it in
the bedroom. That's not a very good game I

369
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:32,269
think, why should you find? It's always better
to close the chapter at the end of the day

370
00:47:32,269 --> 00:47:38,969
and sleep well. All this I am telling you
that you should not miss the point of joy

371
00:47:38,969 --> 00:47:45,690
and happiness. This is how you will really
enjoy your children, your husband, your wife,

372
00:47:45,690 --> 00:47:51,690
everything. In this, as I have always said
that the wife has to be very wise. She's the

373
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:56,940
one who has to be very wise. But not to such
an extent that she allows her husband to do

374
00:47:56,940 --> 00:47:57,690
what he likes. She has to keep a control,
in a way, that he doesn't disturb the society

375
00:47:57,690 --> 00:47:58,180
of Sahaja Yoga.
About other things, like we have about, they

376
00:47:58,180 --> 00:48:02,160
said, I didn't know that you are paying some
money for the school and all those people

377
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:02,529
who are not even having children in the school
are paying. I didn't know this. School has

378
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:08,799
money, no doubt. There's no problem on that
because they are not spending much. But now

379
00:48:08,799 --> 00:48:15,799
you change the pattern. I'll talk to your
leader, and see. And also you can have a proper

380
00:48:16,630 --> 00:48:23,630
house on rent, separately and get all the
children there to study, and nobody should

381
00:48:24,660 --> 00:48:31,660
act arbitrarily. And it should be done properly.
I'll talk to your leader and tell him. And

382
00:48:32,420 --> 00:48:39,420
the children should be seen, even by the leaders,
to see that they don't become racist or they

383
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:47,930
do not become violent. And I think Indian
teachers would be a better idea, because you

384
00:48:48,999 --> 00:48:55,700
see they, they are mild people and it would
be better. And I have also discovered you

385
00:48:55,700 --> 00:49:00,680
have two girls who can work, Indian girls.
It's better that they should look after the

386
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:07,680
children.
And lastly I have to say, I really enjoyed

387
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:18,140
My stay in Sydney. Really. I don't know why
this was called as Sydney, what was the reason

388
00:49:27,559 --> 00:49:34,549
-- and also in the West they don't have meaning
for every name. But it's a very beautiful

389
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:41,549
place where so many Sahaja yogis are there.
And I really feel very happy in your company.

390
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:49,160
I love you and you all love Me. Whatever I
want is your happiness and joy. And please

391
00:49:54,789 --> 00:50:01,789
remember that we are here to enjoy, all of
us. So don't do anything that makes you unhappy,

392
00:50:03,989 --> 00:50:10,369
like having big, big plans, this, that. Not
necessary. There's no need, and if you want

393
00:50:10,369 --> 00:50:16,839
to have you please let Me know. I'll tell
you exactly whether you should do it or not.

394
00:50:16,839 --> 00:50:23,839
Because I don't want you to land up as bankrupts,
or this and that, like madcap people everywhere.

395
00:50:24,390 --> 00:50:31,089
So this is, you have to be careful, you just
inform Me. You let Me know. You can write

396
00:50:31,089 --> 00:50:35,200
to Me that you have such plans and all that,
I'll tell you.

397
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,509
Now this idea of this artist business is,
now that doesn't go into My head, I must say.

398
00:50:40,509 --> 00:50:44,180
They have told Me that they want to get all
the artists together of the world and this

399
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:51,180
and that. It's a very one-sided attitude to
form, you see. Just a few artists are there,

400
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:58,880
then they invite them, and they invite here
and a conference start. That sort of a thing

401
00:50:59,140 --> 00:51:03,329
should not be. If there are artists, all right,
there are artists abroad, everywhere they

402
00:51:03,329 --> 00:51:10,079
are. And wherever you can meet them, you can
meet them. But you cannot separate a body

403
00:51:10,079 --> 00:51:13,529
like that, artists are separately, musicians
separately, then you'll have politicians,

404
00:51:13,529 --> 00:51:20,529
then economists, you see.
So that's not Sahaj standard. That's not Sahaj

405
00:51:23,499 --> 00:51:29,269
Yoga, that's the way people live, you see,
they have separately some sort of a thing,

406
00:51:29,269 --> 00:51:36,269
or if not, they can have a organization of,
say broomstick women, something like that.

407
00:51:42,450 --> 00:51:47,329
So we are Sahaja yogis, and we are Sahaja
yogis and Sahaja yogis. If you are artists,

408
00:51:47,329 --> 00:51:53,200
is by the way. If you are musicians, is by
the way. We are Sahaja yogis and Sahaja yogis.

409
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:59,259
This is one has to remember. Like this the
groups will start. And this clubbing system

410
00:51:59,259 --> 00:52:04,430
has been there in the human nature, has been
there through out. We have been clubbing with

411
00:52:04,430 --> 00:52:10,979
anything. You know, if there's somebody like
the French, they put their spoon the other

412
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:17,979
way round, you see, spoon and fork like that.
So I said, "Why?"

413
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:24,299
"Because we're French."
I couldn't understand this explanation, "these

414
00:52:24,299 --> 00:52:30,160
are French". And then the English put it this
way. Now if you just put it the other way

415
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:37,160
round, I mean, you are a gone case, then you
are no good. So we have to know that this

416
00:52:38,539 --> 00:52:44,489
kind of clubbing was in the human nature because
it comes from the animal instinct. You see

417
00:52:44,489 --> 00:52:51,219
animals also club together. You are from Brisbane?
All right, we sit together. You are from here,

418
00:52:51,219 --> 00:52:58,219
we sit together. It's a animal instinct. Because
of some sort of a fear maybe, that they club

419
00:52:58,660 --> 00:53:03,549
together. This clubbing, clubbing has come
to human race also. For everything you have

420
00:53:03,549 --> 00:53:09,039
a club, you know that.
For you it is not necessary because you have

421
00:53:09,039 --> 00:53:16,039
come out of that state of animal instinct
to higher instincts. Yes, you are an artist.

422
00:53:17,180 --> 00:53:22,219
All right, you are an artist. So another is
an artist, all right. But don't club together

423
00:53:22,219 --> 00:53:28,859
as artists, as musicians, as this, as that.
As long as you have to say sing together,

424
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:34,329
you can practice, again finished. It's very
important point. Try to understand. Clubbing

425
00:53:34,329 --> 00:53:41,329
is not at all a human quality. Clubbing is
a quality of animals. So when we are all Sahaja

426
00:53:43,609 --> 00:53:49,749
yogis, why should we club together? What is
the need to club? And this clubbing has brought

427
00:53:49,749 --> 00:53:55,559
so much problem to us. This politicians, then
this religions, and all this nothing but clubbing

428
00:53:55,559 --> 00:54:02,559
-- that separates. So anytime you find there's
a clubbing system working anywhere, just run

429
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:11,089
away from there. You belong to a very big
community. Now say in My hand, these fingers

430
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:18,229
start clubbing, what will I do with them?
I'll have to make a club out of it. But still

431
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:27,700
going on. I mean when they come to Ganapatipule
there had clubs going on there also. I've

432
00:54:28,079 --> 00:54:35,079
been informed about them. Australian club,
and north Australian then south Australians,

433
00:54:36,239 --> 00:54:43,239
then east, west and southeast, southwest,
so all that has to be given up. One has to

434
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:50,219
understand that we are all Sahaja yogis, all
over the world, wherever we may live, whatever

435
00:54:50,219 --> 00:54:57,219
we may eat, whatever we may wear. We are inside
all Sahaja yogis, and all connected to all-pervading

436
00:54:58,900 --> 00:55:05,900
power. If you become great artistes because
you have got Sahaja Yoga, all right, enjoy

437
00:55:06,369 --> 00:55:11,140
that. If you became great musicians, all right,
enjoy that. If you become an orator, enjoy

438
00:55:11,140 --> 00:55:18,140
that. But you don't club yourself with another
person on those grounds. That is something

439
00:55:19,069 --> 00:55:26,069
not at all Sahaj. In Sahaj you are one with
every one, and with all of them.

440
00:55:26,949 --> 00:55:33,469
See now, My life if it is anything, you should
understand that I am extremely a sahaj person,

441
00:55:33,469 --> 00:55:39,849
extremely sahaj. So wherever I go, I can't
understand. I go to Russia, all these Russians,

442
00:55:39,849 --> 00:55:46,849
they had never known about Me, they have never
heard about Me, they came to listen to Me.

443
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:52,900
Anywhere I go. I mean later on the follow
up may not be that good, but wherever I go

444
00:55:52,900 --> 00:55:59,900
there are in thousands of people. After all
what is so great about Me? See this is it.

445
00:56:02,380 --> 00:56:08,920
What you have to learn -- I am so sahaj and
also when I tell you about, you don't feel

446
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:15,619
bad. Because you know, you know I am telling
you out of compassion and love, and that is

447
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:22,170
important. You understand that because first
thing is compassion and love. And when there

448
00:56:22,170 --> 00:56:27,140
is compassion and love, you cannot think of
clubbing at all, never. You can never club

449
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:33,680
with anyone. You will love each and every
person, and be kind and enjoy your compassion,

450
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:36,640
the virtue of your compassion, virtue of your
love.

451
00:56:36,640 --> 00:56:43,640
And that is, that shows on your faces, you
shine compared to those born again, who were

452
00:56:44,029 --> 00:56:51,029
never born again. They were looking so hazard
and horrible, very harsh faces, with such

453
00:56:55,849 --> 00:57:02,079
a young girl, she had all the wrinkles you
could count on her face, going round and round

454
00:57:02,079 --> 00:57:04,719
and round.
So I told her, "You are not born again, I

455
00:57:04,719 --> 00:57:06,259
am sorry."
She said, "Are You?"

456
00:57:06,259 --> 00:57:11,749
I said, "I am. Look at your face in the mirror.
You will know, you are not born again."

457
00:57:11,749 --> 00:57:18,749
So the greatest advantage of Sahaja Yoga is
that you can enjoy everything. That is the

458
00:57:18,989 --> 00:57:25,989
greatest advantage, whether it is art, architecture,
music, or a lecture, or studies, education,

459
00:57:27,989 --> 00:57:34,989
family life, everything you should be able
to enjoy fully. Then you are a real Sahaja

460
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:42,209
yogi and that you have achieved that state.
Sometimes there are problems, here and there,

461
00:57:42,209 --> 00:57:49,049
something happens, doesn't matter. Have faith,
and you will be surprised at the miracles

462
00:57:49,049 --> 00:57:56,049
that you get. One after another, so many miracles,
but listen to Me and also try to follow what

463
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:04,799
I say.
First of all, no temper. Temper if you have,

464
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:10,059
you must know that it's a serious thing in
the West because there's no controlling power

465
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:17,059
over temper, and schizophrenia is the only
ultimate result of temper. So temper should

466
00:58:19,289 --> 00:58:26,289
not be justified. All ego, temper should be
brought down. One should not try in any way

467
00:58:29,229 --> 00:58:34,709
to get angry with others because of jealousy,
because of complexes, because of anything.

468
00:58:34,709 --> 00:58:41,709
If it is so, please introspect, "Why do I
get into tempers?" Shri Krishna has placed

469
00:58:46,969 --> 00:58:51,789
temper as the worst disease of all, He said
from there it rises everything. But I don't

470
00:58:51,789 --> 00:58:57,130
agree with Him because, you see, it must be,
He was, for Him it's a leela, the whole world

471
00:58:57,130 --> 00:59:04,130
is a leela, but not for everyone. Temper can
come from Mooladhara, can come from Swadishtana,

472
00:59:04,769 --> 00:59:11,769
can come from anywhere. So one cannot say
that the source of temper is going to be the

473
00:59:13,519 --> 00:59:20,519
source of all the problems, can be from anything.
One can really get destroyed by anything,

474
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:26,009
but temper is one thing that is the worst
of all.

475
00:59:26,009 --> 00:59:33,009
So, if you find anybody who is hot tempered,
if you find yourself to be hot tempered, then

476
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:40,920
please see to it that you overcome it. I used
to tell before, I don't know now, there must

477
00:59:42,579 --> 00:59:47,289
be My tapes that if you are very angry, then
stand before the mirror and say all kinds

478
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:54,289
of things. Or else you take a pillow and hit
it hard when you are in temper. Close the

479
00:59:55,039 --> 01:00:01,479
door, hit the pillow and then go out. You
may have to spend for another pillow, doesn't

480
01:00:01,479 --> 01:00:08,479
matter. So you develop a very, I should say,
a pleasing personality. That's very important.

481
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:18,130
You must have a very pleasing personality.
But that is not acceptable in certain countries

482
01:00:25,279 --> 01:00:31,459
because it's said that you should not show
your, any pleasing personality, because others

483
01:00:31,459 --> 01:00:38,459
will think you are weak. The strength is your
joy. Strength is your virtue, strength is

484
01:00:40,989 --> 01:00:47,829
your pleasing personality. That is your strength.
And this artificially, some people say that

485
01:00:47,829 --> 01:00:52,630
if you become very pleasing and this and that,
then others will think you are weak. If they

486
01:00:52,630 --> 01:00:59,630
think, let them think like that. That is their
stupidity. So you should be happy, joyous,

487
01:01:00,219 --> 01:01:05,930
pleasing.
I must say in Sahaja Yoga some people have

488
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:12,930
come up so well that I really feel very proud
of them, very proud. And also, I never expected

489
01:01:14,299 --> 01:01:21,299
this to work out so well in My lifetime, I
never expected because I started it very late,

490
01:01:23,190 --> 01:01:30,190
deliberately. So it is very heartening to
see so many Sahaja yogis coming up, and listening

491
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:37,880
to Me so nicely without taking any objection
to what I say, and then imbibing it in their

492
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:45,279
lives so that they can enjoy themselves very
well.

493
01:01:45,279 --> 01:01:52,279
This time I had to meet people separately
and in one room and all, but next time I think

494
01:01:55,259 --> 01:02:00,329
I'll discuss certain problems openly. If you
people are doing something stupid which, let

495
01:02:00,329 --> 01:02:07,329
us, all of us know. So that there'll be some
fear of people who are doing wrong things.

496
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:14,569
For example, I don't know is he here, Peter
Patten, is he here? He's not here? Peter Patten

497
01:02:17,739 --> 01:02:24,739
from Adelaide. He has been very funny, and
he has to get out of Sahaja Yoga I think,

498
01:02:29,349 --> 01:02:36,349
for some time.
Then there's one Mark, is he here? Where is

499
01:02:37,569 --> 01:02:44,569
he? Just call him. So you see, he doesn't
realize what's wrong with him. And he is trying

500
01:02:48,910 --> 01:02:55,619
to force himself on to others. Is not a very
good idea. You all take a bandhan, I think

501
01:02:55,619 --> 01:03:02,619
you see, it's all right. Where is he? So we
will have a open talk about it, so you will

502
01:03:13,589 --> 01:03:20,589
realize what's wrong with the person. Extremely
right-sided is, the whole thing is burning.

503
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:35,890
Where is he? What's the matter with you? Why
do you want to meet Me?

504
01:03:48,759 --> 01:03:55,759
[Mark: I was just going to get some directions
from You, Shri Mataji.]

505
01:04:03,499 --> 01:04:05,479
What direction?
[Mark: Just about what I should be doing,

506
01:04:05,479 --> 01:04:09,319
as far as more involvement in ....]
I mean, just think of it, if I have to talk

507
01:04:09,319 --> 01:04:11,650
to each person like that, what will be My
situation?

508
01:04:11,650 --> 01:04:17,150
[Mark: Yes Shri Mataji.]
So why should you force your way like that?

509
01:04:17,150 --> 01:04:24,150
You could have written a letter to Me, I would
have known whatever you wanted. You see, now

510
01:04:24,509 --> 01:04:30,999
try to understand what's your problem is.
Your problem is right side. All right? Sit

511
01:04:30,999 --> 01:04:37,999
down and remove it. That's your problem. You
can find it out very easily, what your problem

512
01:04:38,239 --> 01:04:43,009
is, and which you can solve. You can also
talk to the leaders but you have to be humble

513
01:04:43,009 --> 01:04:49,390
about it. You should not be aggressive. "I
must meet Mataji, I must meet Mataji." You

514
01:04:49,390 --> 01:04:56,390
see, supposing you all want to meet Me individually,
what will happen? And you will be amazed only

515
01:04:58,599 --> 01:05:03,589
in Sydney I meet people like this. Only I
have been meeting and meeting and meeting.

516
01:05:03,589 --> 01:05:10,589
For that, now I would say that you should
tell your leaders first. Let them scan you

517
01:05:10,979 --> 01:05:16,719
out, let them write what are their problems
are. Then if I want to see, I'll see. I should

518
01:05:16,719 --> 01:05:23,719
have that much freedom. You can't force things
on Me, can you? I have not taken a contract

519
01:05:27,930 --> 01:05:34,569
with you or anything. So all of you who want
to see Me, should not talk to Vinay, because

520
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:41,219
he's now fed up. He's so tired, he doesn't
know. Everybody is pressurizing him. So now

521
01:05:41,219 --> 01:05:46,469
please tell your leader. Leader has to give
Me your problems. Then I'll see, if I want

522
01:05:46,469 --> 01:05:53,469
to see or if I don't want to see. We have
to stop this. There's nothing special, nothing

523
01:05:57,650 --> 01:06:04,650
great that you cannot tell the leader. The
leader can solve your problem. Because I have

524
01:06:05,759 --> 01:06:12,759
to go from countries to counties, you know
that. Even in Australia, I travel from cities

525
01:06:16,569 --> 01:06:23,569
to city, which I do not do in anywhere. Even
in India, only two places I go to or only

526
01:06:25,609 --> 01:06:32,609
the capital. But I feel concerned about you.
You have gone through bumpy areas.

527
01:06:34,359 --> 01:06:38,559
But try to understand that there's no contract
with Me. If you have come to Sahaja Yoga,

528
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:45,559
doesn't mean that you have right to do what
you like. No. I must cure, I must touch person,

529
01:06:47,499 --> 01:06:54,049
I must see. This is too much. What have you
done for Sahaja Yoga. Ask this question, "What

530
01:06:54,049 --> 01:07:01,049
have I done for Sahaja Yoga? How many people
I have given realization?" I've been just

531
01:07:03,140 --> 01:07:09,910
fighting with others, having family problems,
this, that or "Have I done anything which

532
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:16,839
is constructive to help Mother?" As you know,
My age is now seventy-one, I don't know how

533
01:07:16,839 --> 01:07:19,900
far My husband will allow Me to travel now,
also. Whatever it is.

534
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:25,869
You have to take over. You have to take the
responsibility. You have all the powers, you

535
01:07:25,869 --> 01:07:32,869
have all the knowledge. You are quite all
right now for Sahaja Yoga spreading. So go

536
01:07:34,660 --> 01:07:41,660
ahead. You are wise enough to understand that
now we should spare our Mother. So nobody

537
01:07:45,339 --> 01:07:51,579
should be aggressive like that. All right?
If I have to see somebody, I will see. But

538
01:07:51,579 --> 01:07:56,809
first of all you must tell your leaders and
give them the full reason why you want to

539
01:07:56,809 --> 01:08:02,309
see Me, and if I think it proper, I'll see.
This much freedom you should give Me that

540
01:08:02,309 --> 01:08:09,309
if I want, I'll see you. There is some sort
of a protocol is there for people that they

541
01:08:17,109 --> 01:08:24,109
should understand that you cannot just ask
to see Me just like that.

542
01:08:28,790 --> 01:08:35,790
As you love Me, you can feel for Me also and
understand that what is important is you should

543
01:08:37,059 --> 01:08:44,059
go deep down into yourself and I am there.
I am there, absolutely. I am everywhere. You

544
01:08:46,559 --> 01:08:53,559
need not see My face or see Me. I am there.
Just know this fact that I am there with you

545
01:08:53,609 --> 01:09:00,609
all the time whether you write to Me, whether
you inform Me or not. There are people who

546
01:09:00,989 --> 01:09:07,839
have developed such, such tremendous faith
that Mother is everywhere, that just by praying

547
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:14,839
they have saved the lives of people. Just
from praying. There are many like that. And

548
01:09:16,259 --> 01:09:22,429
really, it is worth seeing these people, how
simple they are. I won't even see them normally,

549
01:09:22,429 --> 01:09:29,429
anywhere. But they are there. And they told
Me how they have achieved so many things so

550
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:37,400
easily. It is very remarkable.
There was one fellow whose mother was sick

551
01:09:38,480 --> 01:09:45,480
in Rohtak and he was in, I think, Bombay and
he received a message that she is sick and

552
01:09:47,239 --> 01:09:52,250
she will die very soon. So he rushed to the
place and they told him that within three

553
01:09:52,250 --> 01:09:58,179
days she will be finished. His mother is not
a realized soul nor she's a Sahaja yogini,

554
01:09:58,179 --> 01:10:05,030
she has never even seen Me. He said, "Mother
I couldn't help it. I just went on my knees

555
01:10:05,030 --> 01:10:12,030
and I just prayed, 'oh Mother, please can
You save my mother?'" Within three days the

556
01:10:12,559 --> 01:10:18,340
lady got all right. They said it's a galloping
cancer. He flew her to Bombay and took her

557
01:10:18,340 --> 01:10:25,190
to the Tata hospital to find out if there
is any cancer. They said, "There's no trace

558
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:32,190
of cancer." He said, "This is the last time
I have asked You for anything." I just, I

559
01:10:34,559 --> 01:10:41,559
just -- it has happened with many.
So it is your faith. Faith is not blind in

560
01:10:43,280 --> 01:10:49,230
Sahaja Yoga, you know for definite what is
Sahaja Yoga is. You have seen miraculous photographs.

561
01:10:49,230 --> 01:10:53,980
You have seen all the miracles happening.
So now your faith should be completely, entirely

562
01:10:53,980 --> 01:11:00,980
in it. And it will work out. I promise you
if your faith is deep enough to reach Me,

563
01:11:02,679 --> 01:11:03,980
you don't have to see My face, even not to
have My photograph, nothing. Wherever you

564
01:11:03,980 --> 01:11:04,270
are, you'll find Me. That's why I always say,
"Develop your faith, develop your faith."

565
01:11:04,270 --> 01:11:04,429
May God bless you!
May God bless you!

566
01:11:04,429 --> 01:11:05,880
So thank you again and again for all these
flowers and for all the nice time I had here.

567
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:05,889
it.

568
01:11:05,889 --> 01:11:05,900
especially when Shri Mataji is reprimanding
some yogis (mark), the transcribing team has

569
01:11:05,900 --> 01:11:05,909
nevertheless included this content not knowing
whether it should really be excluded.So, thank

570
01:11:05,909 --> 01:11:05,920
you very much for the greetings on this day.
It was a Easter Monday when I got married

571
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:05,929
always changes according to the Monday it
comes.

572
01:11:05,929 --> 01:11:05,940
So it was quite a big venture for Me to marry.
Actually, I did not need it at all. But as

573
01:11:05,940 --> 01:11:06,050
you know in India, they won't spare any girl
from marriage, and they have been after My

574
01:11:06,050 --> 01:11:06,110
life since I was about eighteen years of age.
So somehow I managed. But I was in the medical

575
01:11:06,110 --> 01:11:06,159
college Lahore, and suddenly the disturbances
broke out of a very serious nature. And I

576
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:06,219
came back, and there was no possibility of
My going back. Then the whole thing planned,

577
01:11:06,219 --> 01:11:06,280
I think Divine planned it for My marriage,
because I had to accept them. And as My husband

578
01:11:06,280 --> 01:11:06,329
was there, there were many proposals also,
which they chose this one, and I was married.

579
01:11:06,329 --> 01:11:06,400
In a way arranged, because I had never talked
to him about it, he had not talked to Me,

580
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:06,449
but he had seen Me once before.
So for Me it was all right because everybody

581
01:11:06,449 --> 01:11:06,510
so much worried in My family about My marriage
all the time. Throughout I feel that I looked

582
01:11:06,510 --> 01:11:06,570
after My husband's relations, family, though
he had none. He had only one sister whose

583
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:06,619
grandson is Vinay. And all the rest of the
family, all those relations of his, I really

584
01:11:06,619 --> 01:11:06,670
looked after them. And he was counting, he
said, "You have looked after thirty-five nephews,"

585
01:11:06,670 --> 01:11:06,909
only nephews and how many nieces and how many?
Because it was nature, you see, of compassion,

586
01:11:06,909 --> 01:11:06,909
was well placed in life because he had never
bothered about his lands and things. So he

587
01:11:07,690 --> 01:11:08,559
came for the wedding of My granddaughter,
and also of My daughters, and showed their

588
01:11:08,559 --> 01:11:09,329
gratitude. Out of them very few have come
to Sahaja Yoga. Actually, the relations are

589
01:11:09,329 --> 01:11:10,000
always like that. They are so close that I
tell them there's a black point, you know,

590
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:10,050
where everything dissolves into zero. So they
are so close that they cannot see what is

591
01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:10,090
Sahaja Yoga. They have tremendous regard for
Me. They have tremendous respect for Me. They

592
01:11:10,090 --> 01:11:10,139
will do anything, especially My husband has
spent lot of money in the beginning of Sahaja

593
01:11:10,139 --> 01:11:10,190
Yoga, quite a lot. He doesn't ask for it;
he never mentioned it also. And we has spent

594
01:11:10,190 --> 01:11:10,239
so much of his money. We had a joint account;
he never questioned Me, nothing of the kind.

595
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:10,280
Very sweet of him.
So the situation is better now. They have

596
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:10,329
faith in Sahaja Yoga. They try to meditate
also. But they are not seekers, in a way,

597
01:11:10,329 --> 01:11:10,380
because they are so close to Me. As you people
have an advantage, great advantage you have

598
01:11:10,380 --> 01:11:10,420
that firstly you are seekers from ages, and
you understand how important it is to get

599
01:11:10,420 --> 01:11:10,469
your Self-realization, because you feel lost
without it. You think that if you don't get

600
01:11:10,469 --> 01:11:10,510
your Self-realization, you should commit suicide,
and there are many letters I have got saying

601
01:11:10,510 --> 01:11:10,559
that "We were mad. We were seeking, going
to this person, going to that person." Such

602
01:11:10,559 --> 01:11:10,860
big, big letters I got from them how they
were cheated, how they were tortured, and

603
01:11:10,860 --> 01:11:11,010
how they had spent money and how they were
completely lynched by these gurus. Some of

604
01:11:11,010 --> 01:11:11,150
them had to sell their houses, and children
were, they moved from schools, and everybody

605
01:11:11,150 --> 01:11:11,300
became extremely poor. So this was in London
much worse. Later on I found that every country

606
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:11,400
has this problem, they became drug addicts
and all that.

607
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:11,630
Despite all that now we have so many people
who are Sahaja Yogis all over the world, not

608
01:11:11,630 --> 01:11:11,929
only in Australia. But Australia has quite
a lot of Sahaja Yogis, I must say. And quantity

609
01:11:11,929 --> 01:11:12,040
is very, very large and good, and people are
nice, but we have had, as I told you, a very

610
01:11:12,040 --> 01:11:12,139
bumpy start. Because of that, certain conditionings
are built up in people. But now we have to

611
01:11:12,139 --> 01:11:12,300
see that our quality has to improve. Quality
has to improve, and the test of quality, I

612
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:12,300
the artists together of the world and this
and that. It's a very one-sided attitude to
