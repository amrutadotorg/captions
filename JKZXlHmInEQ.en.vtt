WEBVTT

00:05.240 --> 00:11.080
Today we are going to celebrate the Puja of Lakshmi

00:12.840 --> 00:16.720
And I've already told you that

00:16.920 --> 00:21.000
Lakshmi came out of the sea.

00:22.720 --> 00:26.240
And Greece is the Nabhi of the universe.

00:26.840 --> 00:30.480
And whatever Lakshmi they have got, wealth,

00:30.720 --> 00:35.240
they have got it out of the sea faring activities there.

00:36.160 --> 00:40.480
So it is very apt that we should worship Lakshmi in Greece

00:41.080 --> 00:47.080
and understand what is the significance of Lakshmi is.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.320
Can you hear me there, all of you?

00:54.480 --> 00:57.240
Now I've described many a time,

00:57.480 --> 01:01.840
but, again I will describe it to you.

01:02.160 --> 01:07.160
Lakshmi is the one who is a Mother by nature.

01:07.480 --> 01:12.720
So a person who has Lakshmi, a person who has got wealth

01:12.920 --> 01:18.080
must have a motherly

01:18.320 --> 01:23.000
benevolent temperament; that's one thing.

01:23.920 --> 01:29.920
Then another thing is that She stands on the lotus in the water.

01:30.400 --> 01:35.000
So a person who has got Lakshmi must have a balance.

01:35.240 --> 01:38.480
If he moves this side or that side, left or right side

01:38.720 --> 01:42.080
he immediately goes inside the bhavasagar.

01:43.720 --> 01:48.640
Secondly, Her one hand is giving

01:49.160 --> 01:53.840
and another hand there is protection like this.

01:55.320 --> 02:00.160
So, at least a person who has got Lakshmi money

02:00.400 --> 02:03.320
should be generous, he should be giving

02:03.560 --> 02:06.920
and right hand should protect all the people

02:07.160 --> 02:11.080
who are working under him or who are related to him,

02:11.320 --> 02:14.480
his relations or other things

02:14.640 --> 02:18.560
or any other organizations or anything that he is connected with

02:18.840 --> 02:24.480
he should try to patronize and protect it from all kinds of dangers.

02:26.320 --> 02:29.560
The second part is that

02:30.080 --> 02:34.720
one hand of the Lakshmi has got a book in Her hand,

02:35.080 --> 02:38.840
and another has,

02:40.320 --> 02:43.480
no, second part is the

02:43.720 --> 02:47.640
two hands of the Lakshmi which are on top of head

02:48.160 --> 02:51.160
have got two lotuses in Her hand.

02:51.640 --> 02:55.160
That shows a person who is rich

02:55.320 --> 02:58.080
should have a heart like a lotus.

02:58.320 --> 03:04.320
A lotus heart is like this that even a very

03:05.400 --> 03:09.720
thorny type of an insect comes to the lotus in the night to sleep,

03:10.240 --> 03:15.000
the lotus opens its own petals and allows that

03:15.160 --> 03:18.560
thorny type of an insect to sleep

03:19.080 --> 03:26.000
in the very cozy way on the corona of the lotus

03:26.760 --> 03:30.920
so that he sleeps well there, comfort him.

03:31.400 --> 03:37.320
In the same way, a person who is very rich should have a capacity

03:38.320 --> 03:40.920
to

03:45.400 --> 03:48.000
allow guests to come in his house

03:48.240 --> 03:51.920
and to see to the comfort of the guests;

03:52.840 --> 03:55.720
whatever may be the status of that guest,

03:55.920 --> 03:59.000
whatever may be the situation of that guest,

03:59.320 --> 04:03.000
but that is immaterial.

04:03.240 --> 04:05.920
What is important is that he's your guest

04:06.160 --> 04:08.640
and you have to look after that guest

04:08.840 --> 04:13.920
and whatever he asked for you must provide him.

04:14.720 --> 04:18.840
Of course in the modern times it's all vanished into thin air.

04:19.160 --> 04:23.920
But we have so many examples in India

04:24.920 --> 04:30.840
where once a guest came like that

04:32.000 --> 04:36.640
and asked that he would like to eat the flesh

04:37.480 --> 04:41.840
of the child of the king.

04:43.720 --> 04:47.840
So the king said all right you can have the flesh,

04:48.080 --> 04:51.920
and he cooked the flesh

04:52.160 --> 04:57.320
and gave it to the guest. And guest was nobody else but

04:57.640 --> 05:01.480
it was Shri Krishna. You can say Shri Vishnu.

05:01.720 --> 05:06.720
And after five minutes he called the name of the boy

05:07.000 --> 05:09.720
and the boy came running to the parents.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.560
There are so many stories.

05:12.840 --> 05:18.840
Another one is Harishchandra who had a guest who came

05:19.080 --> 05:24.560
as Vamana. It's again Shri Vishnu to take his test.

05:25.480 --> 05:30.760
And he asked

05:31.760 --> 05:34.840
for all his kingdom.

05:35.160 --> 05:37.840
So Harishchandra gave him all his kingdom

05:38.000 --> 05:42.400
and went into the forest with his wife and suffered a lot.

05:42.920 --> 05:46.000
But in that sufferings he got his moksha

05:46.240 --> 05:48.920
and he got again complete reward

05:49.160 --> 05:53.080
of his kingdom and everything. He is very much purified.

05:53.320 --> 05:57.720
And also there is a king

05:58.240 --> 06:04.080
of this coming to a king

06:04.920 --> 06:07.480
Shri Vishnu as Vamana.

06:07.760 --> 06:11.560
and he asked

06:11.840 --> 06:16.000
that you have to give me land

06:16.640 --> 06:21.000
which is measured by my three steps.

06:21.560 --> 06:26.000
Bali was the king. He said: "All right, whatever you say".

06:26.240 --> 06:30.720
So with one foot he touched the sky;

06:31.000 --> 06:34.160
with another foot he touched the Mother Earth.

06:34.400 --> 06:39.320
The third foot he put on Bali's head and put him in the pathala,

06:39.720 --> 06:45.000
in the lower world.

06:46.000 --> 06:49.240
And that's how Vamana Avathara came.

06:49.640 --> 06:53.720
And like that we have various such examples in India.

06:54.000 --> 06:57.640
that when the guests are there how we are to treat them

06:57.840 --> 07:02.000
and how we have to be absolutely subservient

07:02.240 --> 07:07.080
and absolutely looking after.

07:07.920 --> 07:11.480
And it should be an honor for us to see our Sahaj Culture.

07:11.920 --> 07:14.240
This is our Sahaj Culture is.

07:14.400 --> 07:17.560
But what I find, that in the modern times,

07:17.840 --> 07:21.160
people just don't like this because people have become very selfish.

07:21.480 --> 07:24.920
But it is always reciprocal.

07:25.160 --> 07:29.560
If you have guests in your house and you look after them

07:30.480 --> 07:36.080
then it is always rewarded back, always

07:36.320 --> 07:38.640
in so many ways.

07:39.400 --> 07:44.160
In My own lifetime I have seen that

07:47.160 --> 07:50.840
even slightest help you give to someone

07:51.000 --> 07:54.480
how it comes back to you in a very big way.

07:54.720 --> 07:58.840
For example, there were..

08:02.400 --> 08:05.640
Lenin can't you sit properly? Is it Lenin?

08:08.320 --> 08:11.400
Whose child?

08:12.000 --> 08:15.080
Are you not Sahaja Yogis?

08:17.720 --> 08:20.720
Whose child is this one?

08:22.840 --> 08:26.160
She's a new Sahaja Yogini?

08:29.400 --> 08:32.640
Now if the children misbehave,  we'll ask them to go out of Puja,

08:32.840 --> 08:33.840
all right?

08:34.080 --> 08:38.320
Children must behave themselves and sit quietly, all of you.

08:40.640 --> 08:46.560
So once I was sitting outside my house and

08:47.240 --> 08:52.400
I was knitting something in Delhi

08:53.320 --> 08:55.840
and three people came

08:56.000 --> 08:59.640
and they said that, "We have no place to go to, we are refugees,

09:00.000 --> 09:03.240
and you have such a big house, you can give us a room,

09:03.400 --> 09:04.760
we would be very thankful".

09:05.000 --> 09:08.160
And I had house which had a room which was just outside,

09:08.320 --> 09:13.080
it was in no way connected to the house.

09:15.840 --> 09:19.240
So I said: "All right, doesn't matter. You can stay with us.

09:19.400 --> 09:21.560
The vibrations you are giving - nice people

09:21.720 --> 09:23.480
you are not telling lies.

09:23.640 --> 09:25.920
In the evening My brother came and My husband came

09:26.160 --> 09:28.720
and both of them said, now what sort of people these are,

09:28.920 --> 09:33.080
God knows, and what will they  do to us, this and that, very angry.

09:33.320 --> 09:35.560
I said, now I've given them the house, all right.

09:35.720 --> 09:38.400
It is my responsibility.

09:38.760 --> 09:40.480
One month they were very much worried.

09:40.640 --> 09:43.400
They cannot come inside the house. They are outside.

09:43.640 --> 09:47.000
"What is the harm, they are refugees, let them stay."

09:47.160 --> 09:50.240
They stayed on.

09:51.080 --> 09:53.320
Actually they were very talented people.

09:53.560 --> 09:57.720
And then there was one Muslim man. And there were riots.

09:57.920 --> 10:01.320
After this whole trouble there was a riot,

10:01.480 --> 10:04.560
really of a very bad nature.

10:04.760 --> 10:09.480
And all these Sikh people came to my house,

10:09.640 --> 10:12.840
and they said we have heard there's Muslims stay here.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.480
I told them there is none.

10:14.640 --> 10:17.720
They said: "How can you say that?"

10:17.920 --> 10:22.320
I said: "You see I am wearing such big bindhi; I am myself a Hindu.

10:22.560 --> 10:24.400
Why will I keep a Muslim in my house?

10:24.560 --> 10:26.760
You get away from here. If you have to

10:27.000 --> 10:29.160
misbehave then I'll call the police."

10:29.400 --> 10:32.400
So this man was saved you see

10:32.640 --> 10:36.400
and after that what happened that I just lost them;

10:36.560 --> 10:39.240
they went away, they got some jobs.

10:39.480 --> 10:44.840
Then the lady who came, became a very great actress.

10:46.080 --> 10:48.720
And the man, the Muslim gentleman

10:48.920 --> 10:55.160
who was a poet [Shahid Udyami?]

10:56.640 --> 11:00.560
He was a great poet and

11:01.720 --> 11:06.560
after many years, see, we wanted to make a film

11:07.000 --> 11:11.560
and they wanted this lady to become mother in that film.

11:11.760 --> 11:13.720
I said I will not ask her.

11:13.920 --> 11:16.000
She doesn't know Me that I am here,

11:16.240 --> 11:19.840
and otherwise she will have to agree

11:20.080 --> 11:23.560
because she'll feel obliged to Me.

11:23.840 --> 11:25.840
I just don't want to say anything.

11:26.080 --> 11:31.320
If you want you can approach her and don't tell her my name.

11:31.560 --> 11:32.920
So, when they went to her she said

11:33.160 --> 11:36.240
"No, no I can't do it", and this and that, you know.

11:36.480 --> 11:39.160
So, they said all right you come to the opening ceremony

11:39.400 --> 11:42.160
then we'll see you if like it or not.

11:42.400 --> 11:45.000
She was saying: "I need a sari, you have to give me a sari",

11:45.240 --> 11:48.080
this, that and all those things she was demanding

11:48.320 --> 11:50.480
and so much money.

11:50.840 --> 11:53.920
So she came for the opening of that film.

11:54.160 --> 11:55.320
She saw me sitting,

11:55.480 --> 11:58.400
she just came to me hugged me and started crying.

11:58.560 --> 12:00.400
"How are you here? What are you doing here?

12:00.640 --> 12:03.400
After such a long time I am meeting you here.", this and that.

12:03.560 --> 12:06.640
They told that, "She's the one who wants to make this film.”

12:06.840 --> 12:08.400
"Oh My God!", she said, " You didn't tell me.

12:08.640 --> 12:10.400
What a sin I've committed.

12:10.560 --> 12:12.640
I would give my life for this lady.”, and all,

12:12.840 --> 12:17.240
and they were so surprised, and that's how the film was made.

12:17.400 --> 12:20.080
So small things you do good to somebody you see

12:20.320 --> 12:22.080
it comes out in many ways.

12:22.320 --> 12:26.640
Even if you are kind to people who are supposed to be

12:26.840 --> 12:29.480
not so good people say I think it works

12:29.720 --> 12:35.320
Like Me I was... one boy was very badly hurt: here,

12:35.560 --> 12:38.560
bandage here, bandage here and bandage there,

12:38.760 --> 12:42.080
standing there and he told Me that, “I have no work,

12:42.320 --> 12:44.560
can I come and work with You?”  I said: “all right, come along”.

12:44.720 --> 12:47.240
So I put him in the car and brought him home.

12:47.480 --> 12:51.160
So as usual My brother and My husband got very angry with Me.

12:51.320 --> 12:53.560
"Who is this one you brought in? Who is he?

12:53.760 --> 12:55.400
After all...", this and that.

12:55.560 --> 12:57.640
I said: "It's all right, I'll treat him, I will put him right,

12:57.840 --> 12:59.080
then it's all right.

12:59.320 --> 13:01.560
I was treating him, they said: "You must go to the police,

13:01.760 --> 13:03.160
you must send him to the police.

13:03.320 --> 13:08.400
Might be, he might have run away from police.", whatever.

13:08.840 --> 13:10.320
It happened about 8 days that he got cured.

13:10.560 --> 13:14.320
I said: "Let him get cured and then leave". He was much better;

13:14.560 --> 13:16.920
and that day at night he ran away from the house.

13:17.160 --> 13:19.400
Because they were forcing him to go.

13:19.640 --> 13:23.400
And he took away all My husband's money, his coats, and suits

13:23.560 --> 13:26.560
and My brother's everything that he had

13:26.760 --> 13:31.000
and My ornaments were lying there he didn't touch anything.

13:31.240 --> 13:34.080
In the morning these two got up,

13:34.320 --> 13:36.920
this your nephew has run away?  I said "Yes, but what?"

13:37.160 --> 13:41.560
"He's run away with all our things; our shoes, our coats and pants

13:41.760 --> 13:44.240
and your things he has not touched." Even My ornaments,

13:44.480 --> 13:48.080
gold ornaments were lying on the table, he didn't touch anything.

13:48.320 --> 13:51.000
I said: "This is the thing you must learn.

13:51.240 --> 13:55.480
Why were you after his life? After all he was doing well,

13:55.760 --> 13:56.920
you were after his life."

13:57.080 --> 14:00.720
So he has to prove that he has, you go to the police.

14:00.920 --> 14:03.080
But, this is the way you are going to do it.

14:03.320 --> 14:05.640
So many things like this happen in life.

14:05.840 --> 14:10.000
It's so interesting to see how and

14:10.760 --> 14:13.000
you suddenly come across somebody and

14:13.240 --> 14:14.480
they tell you, "Oh you don't remember?

14:14.720 --> 14:18.560
I have been this and I have been that, You have helped me so much."

14:18.840 --> 14:20.920
So always if you are generous,

14:21.080 --> 14:25.560
you are always fed back by someone.

14:25.720 --> 14:29.560
Like if you open one door breeze won't come.

14:29.840 --> 14:33.320
If you open the second door the breeze starts coming in.

14:33.480 --> 14:37.840
So this is one of the qualities of the person who is a Lakshmipathi,

14:38.000 --> 14:42.080
the one who has money to give and to protect.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.080
Now most of the people who are rich people

14:44.240 --> 14:48.720
are extremely harsh with their servants,

14:48.920 --> 14:51.840
the people who depend on them, very aggressive and

14:52.080 --> 14:53.480
start trying to torture.

14:53.720 --> 14:55.920
But in the long run it doesn't pay.

14:56.160 --> 14:59.400
I have seen it. See if you try to be very careful,

14:59.560 --> 15:02.160
like in My house, my servants will never leave me.

15:02.320 --> 15:05.160
I mean, I don't know, everybody used to say:

15:05.400 --> 15:06.920
"Our servant has run away",

15:07.160 --> 15:11.000
somebody would say, doesn't want to stay and

15:11.400 --> 15:13.560
we have had three servants, five servants.

15:13.760 --> 15:15.840
If I had one servant he would last me

15:16.080 --> 15:19.400
till I actually died like that.

15:19.640 --> 15:22.240
I used to wonder what is the problem with these people.

15:22.480 --> 15:25.000
Actually, in the beginning they would come,

15:25.160 --> 15:28.480
they would be very hungry, I would leave everything open to them.

15:28.720 --> 15:30.400
Eat as much as you like.

15:30.640 --> 15:34.000
They used to eat everything and they would feel very much satisfied.

15:34.240 --> 15:36.480
Then Oh! It's too much.

15:36.640 --> 15:39.400
And whatever you may leave in the fridge, anybody would not eat it.

15:39.640 --> 15:42.840
So everything used to be open in my house. Never closed.

15:43.000 --> 15:44.480
They wanted to eat rice they can eat.

15:44.720 --> 15:46.920
Whatever they wanted to do they can do.

15:47.160 --> 15:49.720
And then they became part and parcel of the household and

15:49.920 --> 15:52.160
they started looking after everything very well.

15:52.400 --> 15:56.160
They would never steal anything, never eat anything like that,

15:56.320 --> 15:58.840
and no problems. While others lock everything,

15:59.000 --> 16:00.920
even the salt they would lock.

16:01.160 --> 16:04.840
And count everything and very strict with the servant

16:05.080 --> 16:08.560
and their servants would run away after 3 days or 4 days.

16:08.720 --> 16:12.640
And they would have servants problems. I never had, anywhere.

16:12.840 --> 16:18.560
So this is it that one has to understand that

16:20.400 --> 16:21.640
how you,

16:21.840 --> 16:24.080
those people who are your near and dear,

16:24.240 --> 16:28.000
how you treat them, your neighbors, your friends,

16:28.240 --> 16:31.160
those people who are dependent on you. Now somebody dependent on you

16:31.320 --> 16:33.480
then people try to show down that person.

16:33.640 --> 16:35.840
All the time show in a way

16:36.000 --> 16:38.480
that the person feels very much humiliated.

16:38.640 --> 16:42.560
Then when he gets out of that house, he takes a revenge.

16:42.720 --> 16:44.320
And he ill-treats them.

16:44.560 --> 16:48.480
So this protection has to be there.

16:48.640 --> 16:51.640
Now She's standing on a lotus, means

16:51.840 --> 16:55.000
on something that is very beautifully made but very delicate.

16:55.160 --> 16:58.920
So She handles people very delicately.

16:59.080 --> 17:00.760
And on a balance She is.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.320
Now when people have money, they go into imbalances very easily.

17:04.480 --> 17:06.000
You give somebody some money,

17:06.240 --> 17:09.000
immediately he will go to a pub, get drunk,

17:09.240 --> 17:11.160
will have five, six women around him

17:11.400 --> 17:12.160
or if she's a woman,

17:12.320 --> 17:15.000
she'll run after men and do all kinds of things.

17:15.240 --> 17:19.840
So money is very

17:21.640 --> 17:23.560
very, I should say, a very dangerous thing,

17:23.720 --> 17:27.320
because, it gives you imbalance. It gives you terrible imbalance.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.320
If you have money, too much money,

17:29.480 --> 17:31.320
then you work through to such imbalances

17:31.480 --> 17:33.320
that you cannot get over it.

17:33.480 --> 17:35.560
And one has to be very careful.

17:35.760 --> 17:37.320
You must have seen people who have money,

17:37.560 --> 17:38.920
how their children get spoiled,

17:39.080 --> 17:41.480
how husband get spoiled, wife get spoiled.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.240
All kinds of things are there.

17:43.400 --> 17:45.920
So money has a very big spoiling effect.

17:46.160 --> 17:48.920
And so she stands on the lotus

17:49.080 --> 17:53.920
and anybody who goes into imbalances, falls into the bhavasagar.

17:54.160 --> 17:58.560
Because the Lakshmi is as you know the consort of Vishnu.

17:58.760 --> 18:01.400
And She's

18:01.640 --> 18:05.160
resides with the, on the sea.

18:05.480 --> 18:08.640
So now the word ‘Marine'.

18:08.840 --> 18:13.240
'Marine' has come also from the same, because we call Her 'Maria'.

18:13.400 --> 18:15.480
Maria is Mahalakshmi.

18:15.640 --> 18:17.640
She, the word comes from the marine,

18:17.840 --> 18:20.720
because She was born out of the sea,

18:21.000 --> 18:23.000
and that's why we call Her Maria.

18:23.240 --> 18:27.720
Now this she's born, this Mahalakshmi is a higher principle.

18:27.920 --> 18:31.160
When a person gets into balance and

18:31.320 --> 18:33.720
behaves like a Lakshmipathi and has all

18:33.920 --> 18:38.640
the affluence, he is dharmic and sensible,

18:38.840 --> 18:42.840
then what happens that he develops another

18:43.000 --> 18:47.480
principle within himself starts manifesting, is the Mahalakshmi.

18:47.640 --> 18:55.000
The Mahalakshmi is the thing that you start seeking the spirit.

18:55.240 --> 18:58.000
This Mahalakshmi principle is very important

18:58.160 --> 19:02.000
and it's also the parasympathetic nervous system

19:02.160 --> 19:04.320
is looked after by Mahalaksmi principle

19:04.560 --> 19:08.640
and the whole of Sushumna is nothing but Mahalakshmi.

19:08.840 --> 19:11.480
So when this principle is awakened within us

19:11.640 --> 19:14.000
then you start seeking. They are satisfied people

19:14.160 --> 19:18.840
who do not go hankering after others' things

19:19.000 --> 19:24.240
do not become greedy, and we do not try to acquire the things

19:24.400 --> 19:26.760
that belong to others and

19:27.000 --> 19:30.000
all other kinds of illegal things we do for money

19:30.240 --> 19:33.240
or these people now, this I saw the boat

19:33.480 --> 19:37.000
searching out those who are smuggling drugs

19:37.240 --> 19:39.160
so that it's all mad things

19:39.400 --> 19:44.000
because this is no use; what will they do with so much money?

19:44.240 --> 19:46.840
But, the greed goes on and on and on there's no end to it

19:47.080 --> 19:50.760
That's why people do all kinds of bad things to get money.

19:51.000 --> 19:54.240
But  money never gives you joy, if it had given joy

19:54.480 --> 19:56.840
then people would have been happy, but they're not.

19:57.080 --> 20:01.000
So the Mahalakshmi principle rises where you try to find beyond.

20:01.160 --> 20:06.640
Of course the Mahalakshmi principle you do get

20:06.840 --> 20:10.560
all kinds of comforts and all kinds of blessings.

20:10.720 --> 20:15.560
But you get blessings also anyway but you do not hanker after it.

20:15.760 --> 20:19.240
And you do not deprive people of their things

20:19.400 --> 20:22.160
or sort of they do not tax them with money.

20:22.320 --> 20:24.920
You are not bothered and the money runs after you.

20:25.160 --> 20:27.240
When you are in the Mahalakshmi condition

20:27.480 --> 20:30.240
then said that Lakshmi comes and fills the water in your house,

20:30.480 --> 20:32.920
like that. So then there's no problem.

20:33.160 --> 20:36.000
The Mahalakshmi principle is the one which gives you

20:36.240 --> 20:41.240
all kinds of things which you get all as of fame

20:41.480 --> 20:45.760
then also the

20:46.480 --> 20:50.560
victory also success,

20:50.720 --> 20:54.160
also satisfaction, dignity

20:54.400 --> 21:00.240
and Aiswarya is a wealth which is dignified.

21:00.400 --> 21:05.080
All this you can have if your Mahalakshmi principle is awakened.

21:05.320 --> 21:08.080
And then through Mahalakshmi principle only

21:08.320 --> 21:11.560
you get your realization.

21:11.720 --> 21:14.920
So now in India, for example, there are three temples of

21:15.080 --> 21:17.560
Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswathi.

21:17.760 --> 21:20.320
The Mahalakshmi temple is in Kolapur,

21:20.560 --> 21:24.760
which is a swayambu means just come out of the mother earth.

21:25.000 --> 21:27.000
And is there, the principle is there.

21:27.240 --> 21:29.080
And this Mahalakshmi temple

21:29.240 --> 21:33.480
there people go and sing the song of this Namadeva's,

21:33.720 --> 21:38.480
which you sing ‘Jogwa' yoga pray, because only

21:38.720 --> 21:43.400
in the Mahalakshmi channel, which is the Sushumna,

21:43.640 --> 21:46.000
‘Ambe' is the Kundalini has to rise.

21:46.240 --> 21:50.000
That's why they sing the song that you be

21:50.160 --> 21:55.560
this... in the Mahalakshmi channel

21:55.720 --> 21:59.480
let the Kundalini rise, that is Ude Ude Ambe,

21:59.720 --> 22:01.400
means “Oh Kundalini you rise”.

22:01.640 --> 22:03.840
But they sing it in Mahalakshmi temple.

22:04.000 --> 22:08.160
Not in the temple of any other, Mahakali or any other

22:08.320 --> 22:10.400
but in the temple of Mahalakshmi

22:10.640 --> 22:13.400
and people didn't understand why in the temple of Mahalakshmi

22:13.640 --> 22:15.000
these people go and sing.

22:15.240 --> 22:17.720
Because only in the Mahalakshmi temple is,

22:17.920 --> 22:19.560
in the Mahalakshmi channel,

22:19.760 --> 22:24.480
this Kundalini has to rise and get awakened.

22:24.840 --> 22:29.000
Now this Mahalakshmi principle first was manifested

22:29.240 --> 22:32.720
at the time of Shri Rama as Sita.

22:33.560 --> 22:39.560
Then it was manifested later on Mahalakshmi principle as

22:43.760 --> 22:47.000
Radha, Ra dha. Ra means energy, dha means the one

22:47.160 --> 22:48.760
who sustains the energy.

22:49.000 --> 22:51.160
So it manifested as Radha.

22:51.320 --> 22:56.720
And then it manifested as 'Maria', Christ's Mother.

22:56.920 --> 23:00.400
She's Radha herself, but She created her own child.

23:00.560 --> 23:03.160
As Radha created, she, you see

23:03.400 --> 23:05.480
it's all described in the 'Devi Mahatmyam'

23:05.640 --> 23:09.000
that Radha, how she created the form

23:09.160 --> 23:13.920
and she also created her own child which is

23:14.160 --> 23:15.920
our Lord Jesus Christ.

23:16.080 --> 23:18.560
So this is how Mahalakshmi principle

23:18.760 --> 23:23.240
manifested best in the life of Maria.

23:23.640 --> 23:28.920
And then this Maria kept quiet.

23:29.160 --> 23:30.920
She never said She was anything.

23:31.080 --> 23:33.320
But Christ did say about Her,

23:33.480 --> 23:37.000
and on the cross He said, "Behold the Mother".

23:37.160 --> 23:41.000
Means the Mahalakshmi. Mahalakshmi...

23:41.160 --> 23:44.320
should see to Mahalakshmi. The Mahalakshmi.

23:44.560 --> 23:47.840
It has many meanings. It also means, "Behold the Adi Shakti".

23:48.000 --> 23:53.640
It also means, "Behold the Mahalakshmi",

23:53.840 --> 23:56.320
means the channel.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.000
It also means that your principle of Mahalakshmi.

24:00.160 --> 24:01.720
So that's what He said.

24:02.000 --> 24:04.320
Because on the cross He was very much in pain,

24:04.560 --> 24:06.000
but He said, "Behold The Mother".

24:06.240 --> 24:09.560
And that is the significance that these

24:09.760 --> 24:14.400
people have to look after their Mahalakshmi principle

24:14.560 --> 24:20.160
and also they have to look after the

24:20.400 --> 24:24.560
ascent and the Adi Shakti.

24:24.720 --> 24:30.320
But this Mahalakshmi principle is there within us now awakened

24:30.480 --> 24:33.400
because they are all Sahaja Yogis and Kundalini has come up.

24:33.640 --> 24:37.400
But still we sometimes lose our balance.

24:37.560 --> 24:39.640
We go to the left or to the right

24:39.840 --> 24:42.240
There are some people in Sahaja Yoga,

24:42.400 --> 24:44.560
came to Sahaja Yoga and were making money and all that

24:44.760 --> 24:46.240
and they fell off.

24:46.400 --> 24:47.840
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga

24:48.000 --> 24:51.000
we continue with all our nonsensical things.

24:51.160 --> 24:53.400
So if you have to ascend you must know that

24:53.560 --> 24:57.840
our Mahalakshmi principle has to be absolutely pure.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.920
And that purity we must achieve

25:00.080 --> 25:02.920
and we should put all our attention to our Sahasrara.

25:03.080 --> 25:04.720
Because in the Sahasrara they say

25:05.000 --> 25:07.640
Mahalakshmi becomes the Viratangana.

25:07.920 --> 25:10.000
Is the power of the Virata.

25:10.240 --> 25:15.240
Virata means that, you can say the

25:15.920 --> 25:18.720
Macrocosm. Macrocosm.

25:19.240 --> 25:22.840
So in the brain She becomes the Viratangana.

25:23.080 --> 25:26.840
And there She is to look after the brain.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.720
So this Mahalakshmi principle that enters into the brain

25:30.920 --> 25:33.920
and gives you new dimensions to your awareness.

25:34.160 --> 25:38.000
And also lot of knowledge, lot of knowledge that you know

25:38.160 --> 25:41.840
and you become really very dynamic.

25:42.080 --> 25:46.400
So the first thing that happens to you with Mahalakshmi principle

25:46.640 --> 25:48.760
that you become very intelligent

25:49.000 --> 25:52.640
and you start absorbing, absorbing many things

25:52.840 --> 25:54.080
which you would normally not do.

25:54.320 --> 25:58.760
For example, to sing Hindi song and Marathi song is not easy.

25:59.000 --> 26:01.640
But you have seen how Sahaja Yogis sing it so easily.

26:01.840 --> 26:04.920
Only Sahaja Yogis can sing nobody else can sing.

26:05.160 --> 26:08.640
So that shows that it gives you a new dimension.

26:08.840 --> 26:11.160
Also you know about so many musicians

26:11.400 --> 26:14.560
who have played before me and suddenly have become

26:14.720 --> 26:16.920
very great musicians and have become

26:17.080 --> 26:18.760
very well-known people in India.

26:19.000 --> 26:21.720
So all the musicians in India respect Me very much

26:21.920 --> 26:24.720
and they always want that I should listen to them.

26:24.920 --> 26:30.720
Also it happens in every area of our adventures.

26:30.920 --> 26:33.320
Like even it helps in your business.

26:33.480 --> 26:35.840
We have some business people who came to Sahaja Yoga,

26:36.000 --> 26:37.640
now they have become tycoons.

26:37.840 --> 26:43.080
So the Mahalakshmi principle acts not only on our financial side,

26:43.320 --> 26:48.640
material side, also on our creative side.

26:48.840 --> 26:51.160
Become very creative in our art,

26:51.400 --> 26:56.240
in our expressions of our literature and all those things.

26:56.480 --> 26:59.840
So this principle is the main principle we have to stick on to

27:00.080 --> 27:03.760
is the Mahalakshmi principle and I'm very happy that in this day

27:04.000 --> 27:07.240
we are celebrating this Lakshmi puja,

27:07.400 --> 27:10.920
which ultimately has to become the Mahalakshmi puja.

27:11.160 --> 27:14.920
But problem is that still the people will... are still

27:15.080 --> 27:16.400
lost into these things

27:16.560 --> 27:19.240
which are very dangerous and are harmful.

27:19.480 --> 27:23.240
First of them is alcohol; alcohol is against Lakshmi.

27:23.480 --> 27:25.640
If alcohol comes from one side they say,

27:25.840 --> 27:28.160
the bottle comes from one door,

27:28.400 --> 27:31.760
the Lakshmi runs away from another much faster than.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.000
So you have seen that people who drink

27:34.160 --> 27:36.240
how their families are ruined and

27:36.400 --> 27:39.400
absolutely they don't have any money left.

27:39.640 --> 27:44.840
Another is this what you call is gambling.

27:45.080 --> 27:46.840
Gambling is absolutely against,

27:47.080 --> 27:50.640
because it's a disrespect of the, it is a disrespect

27:50.920 --> 27:53.480
of the Lakshmi Tattwa.

27:53.640 --> 27:57.560
Because Lakshmi should not be achieved by

27:57.720 --> 28:01.640
dwindling or by cheating

28:01.840 --> 28:07.080
or also by some sort of a trick or a play.

28:07.320 --> 28:09.160
That should not be done and when it is done,

28:09.320 --> 28:12.080
it is not respected, so she goes away.

28:12.240 --> 28:15.640
That's why a person who goes to races you'll find

28:15.840 --> 28:17.160
he can never be rich.

28:17.400 --> 28:19.840
Today he'll be rich, tomorrow he'll be a beggar.

28:20.080 --> 28:24.480
So all these things are in Sahaja Yoga even people who play these

28:24.640 --> 28:28.400
what you call share markets and stock markets and all that.

28:28.560 --> 28:32.760
Is against the Lakshmi principle. It doesn't work out.

28:33.000 --> 28:36.320
So the Lakshmi principle if it works out well,

28:36.480 --> 28:40.080
you can get out of the problem of money.

28:40.320 --> 28:42.480
But for that it is important

28:42.720 --> 28:46.760
that you have to meditate and cleanse your Nabhis.

28:47.000 --> 28:50.080
And the Nabhis are on the right side, I tell you,

28:50.320 --> 28:52.560
is of course is the Raja Lakshmi

28:52.760 --> 28:58.080
which is the dignity is the queen, I should say.

28:58.240 --> 29:02.320
But on the left hand side is the wife, the Gruha Lakshmi.

29:02.560 --> 29:08.000
And when the Gruha Lakshmi, the wives, are not sensible,

29:08.240 --> 29:11.720
if they don't understand their responsibility,

29:11.920 --> 29:16.320
said in Sanskrit "[SANSKRIT WORDS]":

29:16.640 --> 29:19.760
where the women are respectable and respected

29:20.080 --> 29:23.920
there only the Gods will reside.

29:24.160 --> 29:27.240
So what happens is that

29:27.480 --> 29:31.480
that when the house wives lose their dignity,

29:31.720 --> 29:33.760
lose their purpose,

29:34.000 --> 29:36.840
lose their aim in life,

29:37.080 --> 29:41.920
also become very wayward and stupid

29:42.160 --> 29:44.320
when they try to compete with men.

29:44.560 --> 29:49.480
Then the society starts getting disoriented.

29:49.720 --> 29:54.920
Gradually you find there is a great decline

29:55.080 --> 29:57.840
and a decadence of the society as such.

29:58.080 --> 30:00.920
Today we find in the west we can call it a decadent society,

30:01.160 --> 30:03.320
very decadent and for that I think

30:03.480 --> 30:05.720
the women of the west are responsible.

30:05.920 --> 30:08.320
If women had kept their feet on the grounds,

30:08.560 --> 30:10.640
it would never have become so decadent.

30:10.840 --> 30:14.240
But it has happened now, it's the responsibility

30:14.480 --> 30:17.480
of all the Sahaja Yoginis to be good housewives,

30:17.720 --> 30:21.480
to live with dharmic [UNAUDIBLE], to be kind to others,

30:21.720 --> 30:24.720
look after other Sahaja Yogis, I've already told them today,

30:24.920 --> 30:28.320
how they treat others and they are there to preserve.

30:28.560 --> 30:30.000
They are not there to dominate

30:30.240 --> 30:34.640
but to preserve the society of Sahaja Yogis.

30:36.560 --> 30:41.080
Now in this place we have here maybe

30:41.760 --> 30:44.480
the 'purvajas' the 'forefathers',

30:44.720 --> 30:48.160
the [Stamatis] might have been doing some very dharmic things

30:48.400 --> 30:51.560
or might have been very religious people

30:51.760 --> 30:54.160
or might have been very God-fearing,

30:54.400 --> 30:57.320
that I could come here and we could do this Puja here.

30:57.560 --> 31:00.160
So it is according to their punyas,

31:00.320 --> 31:05.400
their good things which has brought this Puja here,

31:05.640 --> 31:09.000
and I'm sure they all will be blessed here

31:09.160 --> 31:11.240
and their souls will be happy;

31:11.480 --> 31:16.080
and that they will take their birth again to get their realization.

31:16.320 --> 31:19.320
So it's a very good thing to come here and

31:19.560 --> 31:22.320
achieve this puja here.

31:22.480 --> 31:26.240
I'm very much thankful to you all for coming down here

31:26.400 --> 31:30.720
because it's little far away from Athens, but

31:30.920 --> 31:33.840
such a peaceful and a beautiful place for a puja

31:34.080 --> 31:37.160
and as you see today is the first moon day,

31:37.320 --> 31:41.160
is a very auspicious day today and it's the

31:41.560 --> 31:44.720
Lakshmi which came out on the first night

31:44.920 --> 31:47.160
of the ‘Manthana' they say so.

31:47.400 --> 31:51.000
So she was brought out of the sea,

31:51.160 --> 31:53.320
Lakshmi was brought out of the sea.

31:53.560 --> 31:56.920
And one of the fourteen things that came out of the sea,

31:57.160 --> 31:59.320
one of them was the Lakshmi.

31:59.480 --> 32:03.000
And Greeks understood this and they

32:04.920 --> 32:08.640
worked very hard to have fleet of ships

32:08.840 --> 32:12.760
and they made their money only out of shipping activities,

32:13.000 --> 32:15.640
and so that shows that they had the idea

32:15.840 --> 32:19.080
about Lakshmi Tattwa very well.

32:21.640 --> 32:23.160
Athena was here and

32:23.320 --> 32:25.720
once I went and saw the museum man here

32:25.920 --> 32:30.320
and he told me that we are used to believe in Athena, in one Goddess.

32:30.560 --> 32:33.160
But when some Indians came and told us

32:33.400 --> 32:35.840
this one Goddess takes three forms.

32:36.080 --> 32:37.720
These are the three forms

32:37.920 --> 32:40.000
of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswathi.

32:40.240 --> 32:44.240
These are the three powers [...],

32:44.560 --> 32:46.640
Also, they must have heard about Kundalini,

32:46.840 --> 32:50.920
the way they put snake form.

32:51.240 --> 32:54.920
So it is important for us to start

32:55.080 --> 32:58.160
new traditions and

32:58.320 --> 33:01.160
new behavior and a

33:01.320 --> 33:04.480
and a new type of a society, a new race

33:04.720 --> 33:07.160
that people will see and know that

33:07.320 --> 33:10.000
these are the people who are really

33:10.160 --> 33:12.720
working on their Mahalakshmi principle.

33:12.920 --> 33:16.480
May God bless you all.

33:56.760 --> 33:59.640
Children have to come up to wash My Feet.

33:59.840 --> 34:01.760
All the children, all right.

34:02.000 --> 34:05.000
Come!

01:32:53.640 --> 01:32:58.160
This is just the beginning of it, still not there.

01:32:59.400 --> 01:33:04.080
Be careful; there's a light behind you.

01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:27.320
My photograph is there, but photograph is missing.

01:35:30.160 --> 01:35:33.240
Vibrations here

01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:51.240
This is how what happens to people. This little light

01:35:51.480 --> 01:35:53.920
passes on to them.

01:35:54.080 --> 01:35:57.920
They are all Sahaja Yogis sitting.

01:36:28.920 --> 01:36:33.640
The lines are tying up everything.

01:36:40.720 --> 01:36:45.320
Mother says that the lines are tying everyone.

01:37:06.920 --> 01:37:09.240
They form Omkara.

01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:13.560
Omkar looking like heart later on.

01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.400
Here the Omkara has taken the form of a heart.

01:37:34.640 --> 01:37:36.640
This is Ganesha.

01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:42.080
Here the light takes the form of Mother's name.

01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.760
You are all become one with Me.

01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:13.560
Mother says we all have become one with the Mother.

01:38:28.920 --> 01:38:34.840
All other lights don't show also.

01:38:39.840 --> 01:38:41.160
See how many lights from Mother and

01:38:41.320 --> 01:38:44.320
other lights don't show on the photo.

01:38:44.480 --> 01:38:47.720
Omkara.............. [UNAUDIBLE]

01:39:41.560 --> 01:39:45.400
I hope you have seen My last Sahasrara's

01:39:45.560 --> 01:39:51.400
where the whole [UNAUDIBLE].

01:40:00.400 --> 01:40:04.400
All of you should see them I think. I should carry them with Me.

01:40:04.560 --> 01:40:09.320
I know.. deities, once there are so many photographs.

01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:39.840
Temple of Athena and Surya; too much of Surya heat.

01:41:51.720 --> 01:41:55.400
Zeus.

01:41:55.840 --> 01:41:57.720
So it is very good today because

01:41:57.920 --> 01:42:00.480
after all Lakshmi is a......

01:42:00.720 --> 01:42:03.720
Zeus is the Parashurama Avatar

01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:07.080
and the Mahalakshmi.

01:42:43.480 --> 01:42:46.760
These are the vases from Italy.

01:44:03.920 --> 01:44:06.720
Hello! What is this?

01:44:06.920 --> 01:44:08.640
Such a funny present it is.

01:44:08.920 --> 01:44:10.640
Quite interesting. There is a door

01:44:10.840 --> 01:44:14.080
It has a center Nabhi and full of honey like you.

01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.920
which You have been giving all the time.

01:44:19.480 --> 01:44:22.160
What is this inside... is honey?

01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:27.400
Oh a bottle of honey. There is Nabhi there.

01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:41.000
It is beautiful. It is not funny. Very interesting.

01:45:11.560 --> 01:45:16.240
The Finnish Yoginis baked some bread for you themselves.

01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:20.560
But because the puja was delayed, so it got dried little bit [UNAUDIBLE]

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:21.720
Can I have?

01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:23.840
It is just a symbolic gift for You, Mother.

01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:26.480
I can have.

01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:42.920
Very good.

01:46:11.240 --> 01:46:13.080
Thank you very much. It's beautiful.

01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:18.560
What is this for water? Sharbath [SYRUPY COOL DRINK]

01:47:52.560 --> 01:47:55.320
This is coral.

01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:52.560
That she didn't know how to paint and suddenly she asked Me.

01:48:56.720 --> 01:49:00.160
She didn't know how to paint she just asked My [UNAUDIBLE]

01:49:00.320 --> 01:49:04.000
Spontaneously she painted this.

01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.720
She didn't know how to paint and what to paint,

01:49:08.920 --> 01:49:13.400
and suddenly she has the

01:49:37.000 --> 01:49:43.080
Dolphins symbolize Shri Vishnu.

01:49:50.000 --> 01:49:53.160
Shri Mataji!

01:49:53.400 --> 01:49:55.560
The dolphin symbolize friendship

01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:58.240
and this is from Greek, from Knossos.

01:49:58.400 --> 01:50:01.160
Not only.... evolution

01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:06.400
Dolphin was the first fish which came out of Mother Earth.

01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:11.840
See Vishnu took the form of dolphin also.

01:50:23.240 --> 01:50:24.560
No let her also hold,

01:50:24.760 --> 01:50:27.560
come along, all the children have to hold it.

01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:31.240
Every child has to hold it, all right.

01:50:31.560 --> 01:50:34.240
It's beautiful.

01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:39.160
This is from children?

01:50:39.720 --> 01:50:42.400
Thank you very much.

01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:55.320
Who is Shailaja?

01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:02.840
What is your name?

01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:08.080
Janaki.

01:51:08.400 --> 01:51:11.080
Janaki come!

01:51:11.400 --> 01:51:13.160
Shri Mataji is calling.

01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:15.640
Who is Radhika?

01:51:16.480 --> 01:51:19.000
Beautiful Radhika!

01:51:19.240 --> 01:51:21.480
You have done so well!

01:51:21.720 --> 01:51:23.920
Isn't it?

01:51:24.160 --> 01:51:27.320
Who is Radhika 5 years?

01:51:35.160 --> 01:51:38.000
Who is Kamala?

01:51:38.160 --> 01:51:42.480
Where is Kamala?

01:51:53.720 --> 01:51:55.760
She's not here?

01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:57.840
She's sleeping.

01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:00.320
Who is Ganesha?

01:52:03.560 --> 01:52:08.920
From Spain. What was the fight going on?

01:52:13.840 --> 01:52:17.080
Where is Niranand?

01:52:20.080 --> 01:52:25.400
That’s Radhika? Ah! Beautifully you have done it.

01:52:25.720 --> 01:52:28.720
Where is little Shakti?

01:52:29.000 --> 01:52:31.640
She is sleeping

01:52:31.840 --> 01:52:34.720
Where is Jain?

01:52:34.920 --> 01:52:38.080
They're all sleeping?

01:52:40.760 --> 01:52:44.080
Who is Vidya?

01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:51.240
What's your name?

01:53:45.000 --> 01:53:50.320
Thank you very much for the nice puja.
