00:00:00,056 --> 00:00:14,818
2000-0425 Public Program, Istanbul, Turkey
 Levent Kirca and Oya Basar Theatre

2
00:01:48,652 --> 00:01:53,263
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

3
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:05,337
These are the days of greatest turmoil.

4
00:02:10,535 --> 00:02:17,721
We can see around us all kinds of calamities coming.

5
00:02:25,397 --> 00:02:28,944
Also, what we find is

6
00:02:29,003 --> 00:02:33,600
 human beings are not happy
 with themselves and with others.

7
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:46,862
That means, there is something basically wrong with us

8
00:02:46,921 --> 00:02:50,468
that we cannot live in peace all of us together.

9
00:02:59,205 --> 00:03:01,530
We have no joy,

10
00:03:01,634 --> 00:03:04,149
we cannot enjoy our life.

11
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,111
We are unnecessarily so miserable.

12
00:03:18,377 --> 00:03:23,289
Whether rich or poor, whatever may be the condition.

13
00:03:23,308 --> 00:03:26,125
 People are not very happy.

14
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,082
What is the reason?

15
00:03:38,931 --> 00:03:44,018
Have we been created for miseries and troubles?

16
00:03:50,136 --> 00:03:53,583
To suffer from all kinds of diseases

17
00:03:53,618 --> 00:03:57,133
and all kinds of infections.

18
00:04:07,115 --> 00:04:15,129
The nature also, the mother earth,
everything is not unison with us.

19
00:04:24,693 --> 00:04:28,780
The reason is we are not ourselves.

20
00:04:33,049 --> 00:04:39,368
It is very important as said by everyone
 that you should know yourself.

21
00:04:45,837 --> 00:04:48,742
But how are we to know.

22
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:54,478
Now the time has come.

23
00:04:58,248 --> 00:05:02,041
In the Quran, it has described two stages,

24
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:06,089
one is the Qiyam (to stand up)
 and another is Qiyamat (Doomsday).

25
00:05:12,458 --> 00:05:18,499
We can be saved and can enjoy the Qiyamat.

26
00:05:25,903 --> 00:05:28,038
Or we can be destroyed

27
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:33,773
and suffer the Qiyamat.

28
00:05:37,113 --> 00:05:40,295
So, this is the time of judgement.

29
00:05:43,447 --> 00:05:46,780
It is described in all the scriptures.

30
00:05:51,379 --> 00:05:53,926
Whatever you may believe,

31
00:05:53,992 --> 00:05:57,602
whatever you may think, makes no difference.

32
00:06:04,731 --> 00:06:08,842
Whatever place you live, whatever country you belong to

33
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:11,877
 has nothing to do with you.

34
00:06:23,194 --> 00:06:27,201
Now, how the judgement is going to take place.

35
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:32,955
Within us lies,

36
00:06:32,980 --> 00:06:37,412
a power that our creator has put in

37
00:06:37,437 --> 00:06:41,359
the triangular bone called as sacrum.

38
00:06:54,446 --> 00:06:58,822
This is the power which  is going to give us the

39
00:06:58,837 --> 00:07:03,332
 higher state of existence when we know ourselves.

40
00:07:12,936 --> 00:07:21,118
Otherwise, we are lost in
 the  mess of this worldly illusions.

41
00:07:28,643 --> 00:07:34,095
This is the power which in Sanskrit
we call as Kundalini.

42
00:07:38,752 --> 00:07:44,594
Because it moves like a snake, some people
 also call it a serpent power.

43
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:56,334
But this power is your individual mother.

44
00:08:00,427 --> 00:08:03,776
She has no other child but yourself.

45
00:08:07,205 --> 00:08:09,530
She knows everything about you.

46
00:08:13,102 --> 00:08:17,498
She knows what are your aspirations,

47
00:08:21,790 --> 00:08:24,266
she knows what are your mistakes,

48
00:08:26,983 --> 00:08:32,578
also she knows what is the physical
mental problems you have.

49
00:08:38,688 --> 00:08:43,481
When you were born, your mother took
all the trouble upon herself.

50
00:08:52,348 --> 00:08:56,554
But, she did  trouble you.

51
00:09:03,137 --> 00:09:09,138
So, when this mother of yours
gives you your second birth,

52
00:09:09,187 --> 00:09:12,848
she takes all your troubles upon herself.

53
00:09:23,834 --> 00:09:29,760
I have come here to tell you that
you have this power, all of you.

54
00:09:35,676 --> 00:09:37,608
If it is awakened

55
00:09:37,634 --> 00:09:40,823
and crosses through the six subtle centres,

56
00:09:40,848 --> 00:09:45,129
passes through our sixth centre here

57
00:09:45,154 --> 00:09:50,809
it gets connected to the all-pervading power of divine love.

58
00:10:04,722 --> 00:10:10,055
Einstein has said that he was tired,
 Einstein was tired

59
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:15,252
 trying to find out about the theory of relativity.

60
00:10:29,914 --> 00:10:31,938
And he got very tired,

61
00:10:31,962 --> 00:10:35,662
he went into his garden and started playing…

62
00:10:35,758 --> 00:10:38,847
started playing with the soap bubbles.

63
00:10:49,197 --> 00:10:52,347
While playing with the soap bubbles, he says,

64
00:10:52,382 --> 00:10:55,622
I do not know from somewhere unknown

65
00:10:55,647 --> 00:10:59,459
the theory of relativity dawned upon me.

66
00:11:09,092 --> 00:11:13,220
He called it torsion area, in his own language.

67
00:11:18,098 --> 00:11:21,328
Even you  the disciple for it

68
00:11:21,392 --> 00:11:25,093
who discarded his master

69
00:11:25,125 --> 00:11:30,029
and said that there is something beyond us,

70
00:11:30,054 --> 00:11:33,078
where we have to go beyond our mind.

71
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:50,332
Because  this mind,
because this mind,

72
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,517
reacts to everything.

73
00:11:57,831 --> 00:12:00,561
It is all the time reacting.

74
00:12:04,057 --> 00:12:07,320
And that is how we are upset.

75
00:12:10,731 --> 00:12:13,866
These thoughts come to us

76
00:12:13,885 --> 00:12:18,440
all the time either from the future or from the past.

77
00:12:25,991 --> 00:12:30,039
But we cannot be in the present.

78
00:12:33,395 --> 00:12:36,077
One thought rises like this then falls on

79
00:12:36,102 --> 00:12:40,231
another thought rises like this and falls down.

80
00:12:46,715 --> 00:12:49,349
But when this Kundalini rises,

81
00:12:49,366 --> 00:12:53,325
these thoughts elongate and
there is a space in-between

82
00:12:53,366 --> 00:12:57,628
 and that is the place where there is our present.

83
00:13:11,532 --> 00:13:14,555
So, we come in the present

84
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:20,722
and reality is in the present.

85
00:13:25,652 --> 00:13:28,945
So you know the reality

86
00:13:29,049 --> 00:13:32,604
and you have the knowledge about yourself.

87
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,176
How?

88
00:13:40,224 --> 00:13:45,663
 Because when you get connected with this
 all-pervading power, this divine power,

89
00:13:45,688 --> 00:13:52,608
your hands start emitting kind of
very nice cool vibrations.

90
00:14:11,339 --> 00:14:13,481
This is the Ruh.

91
00:14:15,346 --> 00:14:22,496
This is the divine cool breeze, of divine love.

92
00:14:28,590 --> 00:14:31,827
And in your hand on your fingertips,

93
00:14:31,852 --> 00:14:34,242
you can feel your centres.

94
00:14:41,264 --> 00:14:44,296
That means your hands start speaking,

95
00:14:48,654 --> 00:14:51,810
that’s what Mohammed Sahab has said.

96
00:14:51,835 --> 00:14:57,520
That at the time of Qiyama, your hands will speak.

97
00:15:07,784 --> 00:15:10,649
So this is the time of Qiyama,

98
00:15:10,652 --> 00:15:16,082
where thousands and thousands of people have felt it.

99
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:28,656
If your hands don’t speak about your centres,

100
00:15:28,681 --> 00:15:33,317
then I would not say you really are a Muselmann.

101
00:15:44,292 --> 00:15:47,347
This is said by Mohammed Sahab.

102
00:15:50,416 --> 00:15:57,893
So as a result what we should expect is
 that our hands should speak,

103
00:16:05,653 --> 00:16:12,586
so that we get the knowledge
about ourselves about our centres.

104
00:16:19,181 --> 00:16:22,033
We know about ourselves very well.

105
00:16:22,065 --> 00:16:32,947
Also, we know that this body of
 ours is an instrument of God’s wish.

106
00:16:44,767 --> 00:16:49,779
Because now we are connected with the divine power.

107
00:16:49,832 --> 00:16:55,810
And we have all the knowledge
 which is absolutely true.

108
00:17:06,076 --> 00:17:09,681
So, this is the path of absolute knowledge.

109
00:17:13,953 --> 00:17:20,430
Supposing there is a man
who talks big and boasts,

110
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:24,292
how are we to know that
he is not a hypocrite?

111
00:17:35,634 --> 00:17:39,803
As soon as you put your hands towards that person,

112
00:17:39,829 --> 00:17:43,370
immediately you will know if it is hot

113
00:17:43,402 --> 00:17:47,903
or sometimes even you  get some little little bit prickles

114
00:17:47,928 --> 00:17:50,597
then you know he is not a good man.

115
00:18:05,473 --> 00:18:10,009
Not only that but supposing
you are suffering from some disease

116
00:18:10,042 --> 00:18:17,659
and you will not know it till you go through
the whole procedure of medical investigation.

117
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:34,104
And also that they will not be very sure
as to what is wrong with you.

118
00:18:41,271 --> 00:18:44,961
But on your fingertips, you will know about yourself,

119
00:18:44,972 --> 00:18:46,870
what’s wrong with you.

120
00:18:57,008 --> 00:19:00,423
You will be all in charge,

121
00:19:04,349 --> 00:19:07,340
incomplete knowledge about yourself.

122
00:19:11,097 --> 00:19:16,109
And if you know how to correct your centres,

123
00:19:16,134 --> 00:19:19,302
you can correct the centres of others.

124
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:32,976
Imagine what powers you have.

125
00:19:36,433 --> 00:19:40,577
For example, if this instrument is not connected,

126
00:19:40,639 --> 00:19:44,424
you won’t hear me and it is useless.

127
00:19:53,343 --> 00:19:57,074
But, if you are connected to the divine

128
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,714
the energy starts flowing through you.

129
00:20:09,469 --> 00:20:14,239
But best is this power rises,
she passes through six centres,

130
00:20:14,264 --> 00:20:16,926
she enlightens them.

131
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:28,064
She integrates them.

132
00:20:32,927 --> 00:20:35,831
Not only that, but

133
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:41,060
it informs you

134
00:20:41,275 --> 00:20:45,204
what’s wrong with you and you can correct it.

135
00:20:55,708 --> 00:20:59,556
All your reactions stop.

136
00:21:03,262 --> 00:21:08,861
But you watch everything without thinking.

137
00:21:13,581 --> 00:21:17,430
Like you become a witness.

138
00:21:20,515 --> 00:21:22,482
In that witness state,

139
00:21:22,499 --> 00:21:25,238
you know the truth about everything.

140
00:21:30,787 --> 00:21:32,985
This is so simple.

141
00:21:35,363 --> 00:21:39,690
All this can happen without paying for it

142
00:21:43,434 --> 00:21:46,809
because kundalini doesn’t understand money

143
00:21:49,665 --> 00:21:52,466
nor God takes any money.

144
00:21:54,628 --> 00:21:59,782
It is different if you have to book
the hall, we pay for it,

145
00:22:05,680 --> 00:22:08,354
but not for kundalini awakening.

146
00:22:13,935 --> 00:22:17,287
And you get your experience.

147
00:22:17,312 --> 00:22:18,845
It’s not just talking.

148
00:22:18,877 --> 00:22:22,275
It is the experience on your fingertips

149
00:22:22,307 --> 00:22:25,595
and out of your fontanelle bone area.

150
00:22:39,468 --> 00:22:44,010
There’s no question of blind faith.

151
00:22:52,763 --> 00:22:58,947
It is just the complete understanding

152
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:01,691
within yourself, of your being.

153
00:23:10,385 --> 00:23:13,022
This is what is Qiyama,

154
00:23:13,046 --> 00:23:17,596
 it is where you evolve into a superhuman being.

155
00:23:26,067 --> 00:23:30,892
This country was especially blessed by the Sufis.

156
00:23:36,006 --> 00:23:39,514
They had the experience of the divine

157
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:42,589
but they could not explain how get what it.

158
00:23:52,366 --> 00:23:55,016
But Mohammed Sahab has described it,

159
00:23:55,090 --> 00:24:02,144
that he was riding on a white horse, 
which means the kundalini.

160
00:24:09,005 --> 00:24:14,241
And then he met Moses on the third heaven,

161
00:24:14,305 --> 00:24:18,373
which is true because we too know that all these

162
00:24:18,389 --> 00:24:21,679
prophets are on the third heaven.

163
00:24:32,321 --> 00:24:37,336
Whatever I am saying you can
verify after your realization.

164
00:24:44,665 --> 00:24:48,752
But as a result of kundalini awakening,

165
00:24:48,777 --> 00:24:52,971
all our enemies of anger,

166
00:24:53,051 --> 00:24:56,546
sexual misbehaviour,

167
00:24:57,788 --> 00:25:02,474
that all kinds of bribes, jealousies,

168
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:04,270
all drop out.

169
00:25:19,428 --> 00:25:21,649
All the greed also drops out.

170
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,267
Jealousies drop out

171
00:25:29,785 --> 00:25:32,181
because you are enlightened.

172
00:25:35,299 --> 00:25:39,711
In the darkness, you cannot see who is your enemy.

173
00:25:44,407 --> 00:25:47,375
But when you are enlightened,

174
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:51,683
you know everything and you don’t do anything

175
00:25:51,708 --> 00:25:53,681
that is destructive.

176
00:26:04,218 --> 00:26:07,765
You drop all your destructive habits.

177
00:26:11,993 --> 00:26:17,087
And what comes in your heart is the joy,

178
00:26:17,161 --> 00:26:23,646
is the joy which cannot be described.

179
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,985
For example, we have unhappiness
 and happiness.

180
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,122
Two sides of a coin.

181
00:26:47,678 --> 00:26:53,091
But after realization, you are in complete joy.

182
00:27:00,547 --> 00:27:04,276
And you become absolutely peaceful.

183
00:27:07,757 --> 00:27:10,979
Now what we need is peace.

184
00:27:13,899 --> 00:27:17,382
They are having so many peace conferences

185
00:27:17,415 --> 00:27:19,964
and spending so much money

186
00:27:19,997 --> 00:27:22,919
but they themselves are quarrelling.

187
00:27:31,710 --> 00:27:35,384
So what is the use of having those conferences?

188
00:27:39,619 --> 00:27:43,286
But you have to become peaceful within yourself

189
00:27:47,786 --> 00:27:51,182
because you become very collective.

190
00:27:55,141 --> 00:27:58,095
You develop the collective consciousness.

191
00:28:01,426 --> 00:28:03,473
Who is the other?

192
00:28:05,346 --> 00:28:09,734
You are the part and parcel of one god almighty.

193
00:28:15,125 --> 00:28:19,402
This house and can felt  for this hand,

194
00:28:19,479 --> 00:28:24,541
in the same way, we all feel
 the same within ourselves.

195
00:28:32,925 --> 00:28:37,927
You’ll be surprised sometimes 
we have a conference of people

196
00:28:37,967 --> 00:28:42,485
who come from sometimes eighty countries.

197
00:28:42,510 --> 00:28:46,840
Black, white, yellow, every colour.

198
00:28:46,884 --> 00:28:50,702
And there is no quarrel, no fighting.

199
00:29:08,217 --> 00:29:10,930
Thousands and thousands of them.

200
00:29:11,156 --> 00:29:13,981
They enjoy each other’s contrary

201
00:29:14,013 --> 00:29:16,108
and help each other.

202
00:29:24,116 --> 00:29:25,933
You may be in Turkey

203
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:29,059
but you will find friends in all the countries,

204
00:29:29,084 --> 00:29:32,066
 your brother are there and sister are there.

205
00:29:40,481 --> 00:29:42,616
You are no more alone.

206
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:49,972
You can have them in every field of life,

207
00:29:50,053 --> 00:29:52,697
as your own brother.

208
00:29:58,582 --> 00:30:02,946
It is something we are not aware of ourselves

209
00:30:02,971 --> 00:30:07,808
that we don’t know how great our powers of love.

210
00:30:14,922 --> 00:30:20,106
That a drop which falls in the ocean 
becomes the ocean.

211
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,160
You also become the ocean,

212
00:30:23,176 --> 00:30:25,604
 all your limitations drop out.

213
00:30:37,201 --> 00:30:40,811
This is what is going to happen to you tonight.

214
00:30:44,721 --> 00:30:48,657
I don’t know if I should ask you to ask me questions.

215
00:30:48,701 --> 00:30:51,608
But if you think it is important then ask,

216
00:30:51,624 --> 00:30:54,158
but ask something important questions

217
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:58,909
because you shouldn’t disturb the people around.

218
00:31:28,405 --> 00:31:32,857
Another thing is, it will take hardly ten minutes

219
00:31:32,882 --> 00:31:37,963
or fifteen minutes for you all to get your self- realization.

220
00:31:45,569 --> 00:31:49,735
If anyone doesn’t want it,
they should leave the hall.

221
00:31:55,122 --> 00:31:59,892
The only condition is that

222
00:31:59,917 --> 00:32:04,480
you should forgive everyone.

223
00:32:09,585 --> 00:32:11,869
Also, forgive yourself.

224
00:32:15,334 --> 00:32:19,866
Just you have to say I forgive
 everyone in your heart.

225
00:32:25,281 --> 00:32:30,560
Don’t also think whom you have to forgive 
but in general,

226
00:32:30,585 --> 00:32:34,511
you should  say I forgive everyone.

227
00:32:42,687 --> 00:32:46,115
Also, you have to forgive yourself.

228
00:32:49,628 --> 00:32:55,090
You might have done something wrong, doesn’t matter.

229
00:32:59,562 --> 00:33:02,133
That was in the past.

230
00:33:04,280 --> 00:33:06,399
We are in the present.

231
00:33:09,464 --> 00:33:12,545
Another thing is, that

232
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:17,541
whether you forgive or 
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.

233
00:33:23,367 --> 00:33:28,051
But if you don't forgive 
then you play to wrong hands.

234
00:33:32,726 --> 00:33:37,535
So, now we will have the session for self-realization.

235
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:47,419
For that, can I request all the cameraman

236
00:33:47,452 --> 00:33:52,509
not to take any photograph and to keep quiet?

237
00:34:03,137 --> 00:34:04,604
Just for ten minutes.

238
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:09,512
But when they will raise their hand

239
00:34:09,529 --> 00:34:13,675
saying they have got self-realization, 
then we can take.

240
00:34:23,696 --> 00:34:26,703
So, please wait only for about ten minutes.

241
00:34:32,837 --> 00:34:36,402
Now, as I told you,

242
00:34:36,438 --> 00:34:39,255
you have to forgive yourself

243
00:34:39,272 --> 00:34:41,369
and you have to forgive others.

244
00:34:41,417 --> 00:34:43,107
This is very important.

245
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:58,916
What you can do now is, just to put
 both your hands towards to me like this.

246
00:35:06,928 --> 00:35:08,784
Just like this, simple like this.

247
00:35:09,969 --> 00:35:13,717
Do it like you do for Namaz. Please do like this.

248
00:35:20,576 --> 00:35:22,083
Alright.

249
00:35:33,356 --> 00:35:38,874
Please again forgive yourself 
and forgive everyone else.

250
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:55,641
Now, you can bend your head

251
00:35:58,846 --> 00:36:04,141
and put your left hand top of your

252
00:36:04,198 --> 00:36:09,473
fontanel bone area which was 
the soft on your childhood,

253
00:36:09,481 --> 00:36:12,928
on top and above.

254
00:36:21,717 --> 00:36:25,153
Now see, if there is a cool or hot breeze

255
00:36:25,178 --> 00:36:29,029
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

256
00:36:29,046 --> 00:36:30,380
please move your hand.

257
00:36:43,006 --> 00:36:45,086
Have faith in yourself,

258
00:36:47,031 --> 00:36:49,182
forgive yourself.

259
00:36:52,891 --> 00:36:57,621
Alright, now please put your left hand towards me

260
00:36:57,656 --> 00:37:02,507
and with the right hand
 please see, bend your head,

261
00:37:02,532 --> 00:37:08,656
please see if there is a cool breeze
 coming out your fontanel bone area.

262
00:37:18,622 --> 00:37:22,621
If it is hot, then

263
00:37:22,679 --> 00:37:26,792
you have not forgiven either yourself or others.

264
00:37:26,827 --> 00:37:28,667
So Please do that now.

265
00:37:42,198 --> 00:37:43,920
Alright,

266
00:37:45,908 --> 00:37:48,132
now again, once more,

267
00:37:48,155 --> 00:37:50,951
put your right hand towards me like this open

268
00:37:50,976 --> 00:37:53,031
and see with your left hand.

269
00:37:53,042 --> 00:37:56,226
Bend your head and see for yourself

270
00:37:56,235 --> 00:38:02,081
is there a cool or hot breeze coming out
 of your fontanel bone area.

271
00:38:15,042 --> 00:38:20,205
Now, please put your both the hands towards me

272
00:38:23,347 --> 00:38:28,552
and please don`t think,
 can you do that, don`t think

273
00:38:58,581 --> 00:39:05,854
Now please see, if you are getting cool
or hot breeze on yourfingertips.

274
00:39:05,916 --> 00:39:07,979
It can be gentle

275
00:39:15,993 --> 00:39:20,873
or you are getting it on your palms

276
00:39:24,322 --> 00:39:27,782
 or out of your fontanel bone area.

277
00:39:32,335 --> 00:39:39,509
Anywhere if you are getting cool or 
hot breeze please raise your hands,

278
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:57,767
You all become sufis now. Congratulations.

279
00:39:58,994 --> 00:40:01,224
May God bless you.

280
00:40:06,486 --> 00:40:09,605
Turkey is a very Divine place

281
00:40:12,946 --> 00:40:16,636
and such a short time you got your realization.

282
00:40:20,414 --> 00:40:23,548
Don't doubt it please.

283
00:40:27,048 --> 00:40:29,115
Alright, take down your hands.

284
00:40:40,115 --> 00:40:47,238
I saw more ladies in the airport [UNCLEAR] you see.

285
00:40:47,328 --> 00:40:54,341
but I want men also to become realized souls, 
very important.

286
00:41:03,558 --> 00:41:10,005
Now you will know what is 
pure love, pure compassion

287
00:41:17,019 --> 00:41:23,281
because this is the power of
 Divine compassion, Divine Love.

288
00:41:29,814 --> 00:41:31,965
May God bless you all.

289
00:41:35,757 --> 00:41:40,758
They will sing one song which we shold clap

290
00:41:40,806 --> 00:41:46,654
and you will see that these vibrations
 of cool breeze will increase.

291
00:42:02,014 --> 00:42:05,989
For five minutes, you just feel again.
