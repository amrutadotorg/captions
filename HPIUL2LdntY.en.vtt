00:41:04.572 --> 00:41:09.282
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:41:09.282 --> 00:41:23.852
At the very outset, I have to tell you that
truth is what it is.

00:41:23.852 --> 00:41:30.692
You cannot change it; you cannot transform
it; you cannot conceptualize it.

00:41:30.692 --> 00:41:41.232
It is what it is; it was what it was and it
will be what it will be.

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:56.812
Whatever, I want to tell you today, I have
to request you, to keep your mind open, like

00:41:56.812 --> 00:41:57.932
scientist.

00:41:57.932 --> 00:42:00.902
You need not believe into what I say.

00:42:00.902 --> 00:42:05.342
We have had enough of problems with blind
faith.

00:42:05.342 --> 00:42:17.162
But keep your minds open in case this proves;
then you have to believe, believe in it.

00:42:17.162 --> 00:42:20.502
If you are honest people, you have to believe
in it.

00:42:20.502 --> 00:42:30.362
Because it is for the benevolence of your
individual self, for the benevolence of your

00:42:30.362 --> 00:42:36.521
city, your country and world at large.

00:42:36.521 --> 00:42:43.752
Most of the problems of this world come from
human beings; humbly we must admit.

00:42:43.752 --> 00:42:50.732
There something wrong somewhere that we create
problems.

00:42:50.732 --> 00:42:57.792
And these problems come to human beings when
there is a problem with these centres here

00:42:57.792 --> 00:43:01.872
as explained to you.

00:43:01.872 --> 00:43:03.822
Now these centres do exist.

00:43:03.822 --> 00:43:06.572
These are energy centres within you.

00:43:06.572 --> 00:43:12.832
And when they are, (Mother speaks aside, Thank
you, (Lawrence?)

00:43:12.832 --> 00:43:25.512
thank you, its cold, I don’t like, I like,
just ordinary (glass of water)) these centres,

00:43:25.512 --> 00:43:37.602
when they go into jeopardy, we have this problem
of human beings behaving in funny manners.

00:43:37.602 --> 00:43:52.112
When this power, which is within us, which
is in three and a half coils; that’s why

00:43:52.112 --> 00:43:54.922
it is called as kundalini; “kundalini”
means a coil.

00:43:54.922 --> 00:43:57.302
It’s a mathematical thing.

00:43:57.302 --> 00:44:10.822
It rises like a primule in a seed and rises
upward against the gravity, and pierces through

00:44:10.822 --> 00:44:21.712
your fontanel bone area, which was the soft
bone in your childhood.

00:44:21.712 --> 00:44:31.231
(Mother speaks aside, Thank you very much,
(referring to glass of water) thank you)

00:44:31.231 --> 00:44:42.451
Now the truth is that you are not this body,
you are not this mind, you are not this ego,

00:44:42.451 --> 00:44:46.802
you are not these conditionings.

00:44:46.802 --> 00:44:53.792
What we say, “This is my house, this is
my car, this is my wife, this is my husband,

00:44:53.792 --> 00:45:02.162
my children” but who is this ‘my’ which
owns it?

00:45:02.162 --> 00:45:12.682
So that ‘my’ which owns it is the ‘I’
the “self”; is the ‘pure spirit’ within

00:45:12.682 --> 00:45:14.132
you.

00:45:14.132 --> 00:45:27.492
The second truth is, that there is all-pervading
power of Divine Love, of love, which does

00:45:27.492 --> 00:45:29.982
all the living work.

00:45:29.982 --> 00:45:34.322
Now you see beautiful flowers all over since
I’ve come to Australia.

00:45:34.322 --> 00:45:39.212
I’ve been seeing all kinds of flowers, beautiful
flowers.

00:45:39.212 --> 00:45:41.512
Who does this miracle?

00:45:41.512 --> 00:45:44.852
They’re different, of a different shape,
different colour.

00:45:44.852 --> 00:45:45.852
“Who” does that?

00:45:45.852 --> 00:45:52.042
Who runs our heart, we never ask this question
to ourselves.

00:45:52.042 --> 00:45:54.662
We take all living work for granted.

00:45:54.662 --> 00:46:04.482
We never bother to find out who does that.

00:46:04.482 --> 00:46:10.442
The third question that should come to us
really, which cannot be answered by anyone:

00:46:10.442 --> 00:46:13.731
“Why are we on this Earth?

00:46:13.731 --> 00:46:19.682
What is our purpose of coming to this Earth,
to be born as human beings, to be evolved

00:46:19.682 --> 00:46:22.412
as human beings, what is the purpose?”

00:46:22.412 --> 00:46:27.542
Is it just to insure our self and die?

00:46:27.542 --> 00:46:29.702
Is that?

00:46:29.702 --> 00:46:31.692
What is the purpose of life?

00:46:31.692 --> 00:46:33.422
What is our identity?

00:46:33.422 --> 00:46:42.352
And when we start asking these questions,
we find that nobody has been able to answer

00:46:42.352 --> 00:46:53.812
this question.

00:46:53.812 --> 00:46:57.572
Science cannot answer this question.

00:46:57.572 --> 00:47:01.852
Science has its own limitations.

00:47:01.852 --> 00:47:08.802
So this all-pervading power, which does all
the living work, we have never felt it.

00:47:08.802 --> 00:47:13.862
We have read it in Scriptures that there is
all-pervading power of God’s love, there’s

00:47:13.862 --> 00:47:15.572
the ‘Ruh’, is there.

00:47:15.572 --> 00:47:21.582
They call it Paramchaitanya or also they say
it is the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:47:21.582 --> 00:47:24.142
But where is that?

00:47:24.142 --> 00:47:27.332
Nobody has felt it, nobody has known about
it.

00:47:27.332 --> 00:47:36.872
Another problem is this that our civilizations
grew too big in the West, even in Australia,

00:47:36.872 --> 00:47:37.872
everywhere.

00:47:37.872 --> 00:47:44.902
Like a big tree but what about the roots?

00:47:44.902 --> 00:47:49.992
If you do not find the roots, the result is
as you have now recession; this problem, that

00:47:49.992 --> 00:47:52.722
problem.

00:47:52.722 --> 00:47:55.862
So where are the roots?

00:47:55.862 --> 00:48:02.692
If the knowledge of Science comes from West,
this knowledge comes to you, say from India,

00:48:02.692 --> 00:48:07.041
or from East, what’s the harm.

00:48:07.041 --> 00:48:12.452
Because it is important that we should know
our roots.

00:48:12.452 --> 00:48:18.002
And these are the roots, this is the knowledge
of the roots that is within us.

00:48:18.002 --> 00:48:23.882
When there is problem outwardly, we should
know there must be some problem inside us

00:48:23.882 --> 00:48:29.112
and we don’t know anything about ourselves;
nothing.

00:48:29.112 --> 00:48:31.522
What we know; about outside.

00:48:31.522 --> 00:48:42.412
But we don’t know what’s wrong with us;
where do we go wrong?

00:48:42.412 --> 00:48:51.182
So it is very important to understand that
if there is a way of going through the last

00:48:51.182 --> 00:48:56.822
breakthrough of our evolution, if there’s
a way that we can find out our identity, if

00:48:56.822 --> 00:49:02.812
there’s a way we can know our inner self
fully, why not do it?

00:49:02.812 --> 00:49:05.512
For which you don’t have to pay.

00:49:05.512 --> 00:49:09.122
You can’t pay; it’s an evolutionary process.

00:49:09.122 --> 00:49:10.972
It’s a living process!

00:49:10.972 --> 00:49:17.412
For example, how much do we pay for these
flowers to Mother Earth?

00:49:17.412 --> 00:49:19.942
Who’s done the job?

00:49:19.942 --> 00:49:34.201
It’s built-in in a seed, to germinate and
built-in in the Mother Land that it will germinate.

00:49:34.201 --> 00:49:35.322
We don’t pay for that.

00:49:35.322 --> 00:49:36.562
It’s already built-in there.

00:49:36.562 --> 00:49:41.012
In the same way if it is built-in within you,
you can’t pay for it.

00:49:41.012 --> 00:49:47.172
One thing, if you realize that you can’t
pay for your evolutionary process, for anything

00:49:47.172 --> 00:49:56.312
that is Divinity, for anything that is pure;
half of the problems will be solved of this

00:49:56.312 --> 00:50:01.182
guru shopping that you have been doing all
these days.

00:50:01.182 --> 00:50:08.862
Because if you are not going to pay for it,
and these people are asking for money, that

00:50:08.862 --> 00:50:10.492
means something wrong with them!

00:50:10.492 --> 00:50:12.502
You cannot market it!

00:50:12.502 --> 00:50:24.552
Thus, we reach a point where we realize that
something spontaneous living process has to

00:50:24.552 --> 00:50:25.902
take place.

00:50:25.902 --> 00:50:35.302
And that has become very, very easy in modern
times.

00:50:35.302 --> 00:50:41.052
Because it is described already, prophesized
in the Bible, it is the Last Judgment and

00:50:41.052 --> 00:50:45.332
otherwise in the Koran it is “Qiyamah”,
means the Resurrection.

00:50:45.332 --> 00:50:50.762
Even in Indian scriptures they have described
about these special times when people who

00:50:50.762 --> 00:50:58.692
will get so much disillusioned in the illusion,
they will be born and they will be disillusioned

00:50:58.692 --> 00:51:01.982
that they take to reality, and this thing
will happen.

00:51:01.982 --> 00:51:10.591
It’s already predicted and this is the time,
such a fortunate time when we are all born.

00:51:10.591 --> 00:51:13.542
And it has to work out.

00:51:13.542 --> 00:51:15.232
It is your own power.

00:51:15.232 --> 00:51:24.202
It’s your own Mother, it’s your individual
Mother, and She knows everything about you.

00:51:24.202 --> 00:51:26.062
It’s all tape-recorded.

00:51:26.062 --> 00:51:29.172
And She is anxious to give you this Second
Birth.

00:51:29.172 --> 00:51:31.392
She is anxious.

00:51:31.392 --> 00:51:33.172
And She does it very beautifully.

00:51:33.172 --> 00:51:39.742
I’ve read some books which says that Kundalini
Awakening is very dangerous and all that.

00:51:39.742 --> 00:51:40.742
I can’t understand!

00:51:40.742 --> 00:51:43.091
It has never happened before like that.

00:51:43.091 --> 00:51:49.651
I’ve been working like this for the last,
I think, I don’t know how many years now;

00:51:49.651 --> 00:51:56.132
at least twenty-five years and I’ve never
seen anybody being harmed.

00:51:56.132 --> 00:51:59.962
On the contrary, everybody’s helped; physically,
mentally, emotionally.

00:51:59.962 --> 00:52:13.712
Now there are three doctors who have got M.D.
in Delhi University for Sahaja Yoga, in various

00:52:13.712 --> 00:52:14.712
subjects.

00:52:14.712 --> 00:52:19.841
Now there’s a fourth doctor who is trying
on blood cancer and all that.

00:52:19.841 --> 00:52:24.482
For medical science, if you ask them who does
all these things they will say “autonomous

00:52:24.482 --> 00:52:25.902
nervous system”.

00:52:25.902 --> 00:52:31.252
But who is this “auto”, who is this “auto”
that does this work?

00:52:31.252 --> 00:52:35.342
They can’t answer; they’re honest; they
can’t answer.

00:52:35.342 --> 00:52:44.112
So this autonomous nervous system, which is
parasympathetic and sympathetic, the parasympathetic

00:52:44.112 --> 00:52:50.782
nervous system will take over and we can control
our parasympathetic through this.

00:52:50.782 --> 00:52:59.222
Of course, I don’t know how far the doctors
here are sensitive to a subject like that

00:52:59.222 --> 00:53:01.572
but in Russia I was surprised.

00:53:01.572 --> 00:53:06.862
There are two hundred doctors who are practicing
Sahaja Yoga in Russia.

00:53:06.862 --> 00:53:12.482
Russian people are not so materialistic because
they have never known materialism much.

00:53:12.482 --> 00:53:15.182
About 30% of them are funny type.

00:53:15.182 --> 00:53:21.582
They’ll ask for Marlboro cigarettes but
70% are so sensitive to Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:21.582 --> 00:53:27.742
I was amazed the way they took to me and threw
away all absurd gurus from them.

00:53:27.742 --> 00:53:29.672
Not one person could prosper.

00:53:29.672 --> 00:53:36.692
And no religion is allowed to be practiced
there where they have now started taking to

00:53:36.692 --> 00:53:37.692
Sahaja Yoga.

00:53:37.692 --> 00:53:44.912
It’s very amazing how these people who don’t
know even English, who don’t know about

00:53:44.912 --> 00:53:51.022
God; they were not supposed to know about
any religion, they’re so clean, like a clean

00:53:51.022 --> 00:53:56.582
slate and they have taken to Sahaja in such
a big manner; I’m surprised.

00:53:56.582 --> 00:54:04.012
In thousands and thousands of people, so sensitive,
so open-minded and scientifically so equipped.

00:54:04.012 --> 00:54:10.712
There were 300 scientists, I think maybe more,
who invited me.

00:54:10.712 --> 00:54:15.552
Started telling them about I…I thought,
better start from science.

00:54:15.552 --> 00:54:18.572
So they said, “Mother, no, don’t tell
us science; we know everything about science.

00:54:18.572 --> 00:54:21.312
No we don’t, You tell us the science of
God.”

00:54:21.312 --> 00:54:30.722
Such eager, intelligent, educated people.

00:54:30.722 --> 00:54:37.432
Now, this democracy of ours ‘so-called’,
today also in the newspaper.

00:54:37.432 --> 00:54:41.722
I read the same thing: “so-called democracy”.

00:54:41.722 --> 00:54:47.172
Because it looks sometimes like a demonocracy
you see, like you go to America; you can’t

00:54:47.172 --> 00:54:50.342
even wear your wedding ring.

00:54:50.342 --> 00:54:54.212
They might take away your wedding ring also
and kill you for that.

00:54:54.212 --> 00:54:58.352
That’s supposed to be democracy!

00:54:58.352 --> 00:55:00.832
You have to be extremely careful.

00:55:00.832 --> 00:55:02.312
I was surprised in Perth.

00:55:02.312 --> 00:55:06.972
We were going in the night for about thirty-five
kilometres.

00:55:06.972 --> 00:55:09.612
No gangsterism on the way, I was surprised.

00:55:09.612 --> 00:55:12.892
How this country is still saved.

00:55:12.892 --> 00:55:19.322
But it happens that this kind of democracy
without being in connection with that all-pervading

00:55:19.322 --> 00:55:22.872
power can take you to anything.

00:55:22.872 --> 00:55:25.031
Same with religions.

00:55:25.031 --> 00:55:30.132
You take any religion, whether you are Hindu,
Christian, Muslim, anything.

00:55:30.132 --> 00:55:32.122
One can commit any sin.

00:55:32.122 --> 00:55:38.012
What’s the use of denouncing others; everybody
does the same I thing; no difference.

00:55:38.012 --> 00:55:49.902
All are only convinced they are something
excellent but they are not, in no way!

00:55:49.902 --> 00:55:56.692
And so many things like this, when we start
seeing, we get disillusioned and we start

00:55:56.692 --> 00:56:03.192
thinking, “Where is the truth, where is
the reality, what are we doing?”

00:56:03.192 --> 00:56:09.211
At this time, I see; I call them ‘the seekers
of truth’.

00:56:09.211 --> 00:56:20.692
These are special category of people, as described
by so many poets.

00:56:20.692 --> 00:56:32.512
And when it works out, they are the ones who
jump into themselves.

00:56:32.512 --> 00:56:38.171
Jump into this beautiful era, of what we call
the New Age.

00:56:38.171 --> 00:56:39.442
It’s a happening.

00:56:39.442 --> 00:56:44.242
It’s not just branding yourself New Age;
somebody calls themselves by some other name,

00:56:44.242 --> 00:56:45.862
it’s not that.

00:56:45.862 --> 00:56:49.091
It’s another Christian, Hindu, Muslim branding.

00:56:49.091 --> 00:56:55.792
But something that has to happen and that
happening is awakening of the kundalini.

00:56:55.792 --> 00:57:03.512
William Blake has said that men of God will
be born in those days, men of God.

00:57:03.512 --> 00:57:07.612
And they will become divine and they will
have powers to make others divine, exactly

00:57:07.612 --> 00:57:15.112
that is Sahaja Yoga.

00:57:15.112 --> 00:57:26.382
Moreover it’s such an internal happening
that, all outside things are not needed.

00:57:26.382 --> 00:57:31.931
For example, some people go to Himalayas,
stand on their heads.

00:57:31.931 --> 00:57:36.822
Or they starve themselves, fast, do all kinds
of things.

00:57:36.822 --> 00:57:37.822
And they find nothing.

00:57:37.822 --> 00:57:40.301
They can’t understand how it happens.

00:57:40.301 --> 00:57:47.462
They go on telling me; Mother we did this,
we did that and we never found anything within

00:57:47.462 --> 00:57:49.342
ourselves.

00:57:49.342 --> 00:57:57.692
So first you are to be connected to that all
pervading power, this is the power that’s

00:57:57.692 --> 00:58:04.482
extremely dynamic no doubt, but it’s the
power of compassion.

00:58:04.482 --> 00:58:06.342
So you also become very dynamic.

00:58:06.342 --> 00:58:08.542
I know poor people becoming very rich suddenly.

00:58:08.542 --> 00:58:13.411
I have seen people who are sick becoming all
right.

00:58:13.411 --> 00:58:21.442
We have a very nice place in Perth, where
a boy who was already married, had children,

00:58:21.442 --> 00:58:22.621
two children.

00:58:22.621 --> 00:58:29.442
He was in an accident and whole his brain
as if came out; a terrible condition.

00:58:29.442 --> 00:58:32.921
And doctors gave it up that he will die.

00:58:32.921 --> 00:58:37.281
Not that he was saved, but he is absolutely
normal now.

00:58:37.281 --> 00:58:44.791
I was in tears to see him so beautifully cured.

00:58:44.791 --> 00:58:57.171
So this all-pervading power, which is the
Ocean of Bliss, Ocean of Knowledge, Ocean

00:58:57.171 --> 00:59:05.391
of Compassion, is the Ocean of Forgiveness.

00:59:05.391 --> 00:59:09.051
This power starts flowing through you.

00:59:09.051 --> 00:59:13.142
You become a vehicle of that power.

00:59:13.142 --> 00:59:22.832
And once you learn how to make others the
same way, how to raise their kundalini, you

00:59:22.832 --> 00:59:26.431
can create thousands of people who are self-realized.

00:59:26.431 --> 00:59:34.741
Surprisingly, in Australia many children are
born who are realized souls, very surprising.

00:59:34.741 --> 00:59:42.382
Maybe because in other European countries
children are killed by the parents.

00:59:42.382 --> 00:59:46.761
So maybe they are taking to you people who
are kind to children and your government is

00:59:46.761 --> 00:59:49.332
also very kind to them.

00:59:49.332 --> 00:59:59.332
And these children are not understood by parents
sometimes because they’re very different.

00:59:59.332 --> 01:00:02.281
And they are very moral.

01:00:02.281 --> 01:00:10.142
So all the problems that we have created out
of our ideas of sort of modernism or any kind

01:00:10.142 --> 01:00:11.661
of thing.

01:00:11.661 --> 01:00:19.862
And that we see that our children are going
to dogs is all stopped through this awakening.

01:00:19.862 --> 01:00:28.801
It’s like this, that if I tell some children
don’t take to drugs, they’ll never listen

01:00:28.801 --> 01:00:30.602
to me.

01:00:30.602 --> 01:00:36.832
If, supposing I’m carrying a snake in my
hand and there’s darkness all over, I can’t

01:00:36.832 --> 01:00:40.371
see anything and somebody says, “you have
a snake in your hand”, I’ll never give

01:00:40.371 --> 01:00:43.222
up if I’m very obstinate, I will never give
up.

01:00:43.222 --> 01:00:45.262
I’ll say, “No, it’s just a rope.”

01:00:45.262 --> 01:00:51.881
But when there’s little light I will myself
give it up.

01:00:51.881 --> 01:00:57.622
In the same way it happens; it works this
way that you yourself become powerful.

01:00:57.622 --> 01:01:06.521
Throw away all that is destructive, all that
is to be given up.

01:01:06.521 --> 01:01:10.892
I don’t have to say “Don’t do this;
the Ten Commandments we don’t talk about

01:01:10.892 --> 01:01:15.881
in Sahaja Yoga, but only in you, the religion
is born.

01:01:15.881 --> 01:01:21.861
The innate religion, which keeps you religious,
righteous, compassionate and dynamic.

01:01:21.861 --> 01:01:27.193
You don’t have to change your dress, you
don’t have to change your lifestyle, you

01:01:27.193 --> 01:01:32.342
don’t have to give up your wives and children,
but you get it just where you are.

01:01:32.342 --> 01:01:36.371
It’s so simple, made so simple.

01:01:36.371 --> 01:01:41.521
I would say, if you are hungry, you can have
it.

01:01:41.521 --> 01:01:47.551
Like, if I’ve done the cooking, and if you
are hungry and you will say otherwise “mother

01:01:47.551 --> 01:01:48.731
just lets have the food.”

01:01:48.731 --> 01:01:52.942
But if you are not, then you will go on discussing,
arguing, this, that.

01:01:52.942 --> 01:01:57.051
These are all mental feats.

01:01:57.051 --> 01:02:02.021
I mean if you want to ask me a question, you
can ask me any number and I am quite an expert

01:02:02.021 --> 01:02:09.362
now 25 years I have been facing all of you
and I can answer you, but its all a mental

01:02:09.362 --> 01:02:10.362
feat.

01:02:10.362 --> 01:02:11.742
It doesn’t give you realization.

01:02:11.742 --> 01:02:17.181
You are here for your realization, by which
you are helped so much that physically, mentally,

01:02:17.181 --> 01:02:23.311
emotionally, and spiritually you become all
right.

01:02:23.311 --> 01:02:29.731
Firstly, you become peaceful, absolutely peaceful.

01:02:29.731 --> 01:02:32.092
The peace within you, you achieve.

01:02:32.092 --> 01:02:33.502
How?

01:02:33.502 --> 01:02:35.801
You live with your thoughts.

01:02:35.801 --> 01:02:43.281
The thoughts rise, fall, rise, fall and in
between these thoughts, there’s a little

01:02:43.281 --> 01:02:44.291
space.

01:02:44.291 --> 01:02:48.361
Mostly, you are thinking about the future
or the past.

01:02:48.361 --> 01:02:52.771
You cannot be in the present.

01:02:52.771 --> 01:02:54.811
In the present, there is no thought.

01:02:54.811 --> 01:02:57.342
You are with reality.

01:02:57.342 --> 01:03:02.012
So when the kundalini rises, these thoughts
elongate and the space in between, of the

01:03:02.012 --> 01:03:05.212
present is established.

01:03:05.212 --> 01:03:13.531
When that space is established, you become
peaceful, absolutely peaceful within yourself.

01:03:13.531 --> 01:03:25.722
I have met many people, elite people, I should
say, very elite, who have got Peace Prizes.

01:03:25.722 --> 01:03:32.261
They’re so hot-tempered people, I tell you,
that you have to touch them with a barge pole.

01:03:32.261 --> 01:03:34.181
I mean you cannot go near them.

01:03:34.181 --> 01:03:38.942
It is horribly hot-tempered people, and they
have got peace awards I don’t know how.

01:03:38.942 --> 01:03:39.942
No peace within.

01:03:39.942 --> 01:03:43.102
At the slightest thing, they just shoot off.

01:03:43.102 --> 01:03:45.142
No patience, nothing.

01:03:45.142 --> 01:03:53.931
And then I realize that it’s so outside;
the whole thing is.

01:03:53.931 --> 01:03:59.551
They don’t understand if you don’t have
peace within, how can have a Peace Award?

01:03:59.551 --> 01:04:01.551
Well you can.

01:04:01.551 --> 01:04:04.421
That is our life.

01:04:04.421 --> 01:04:10.762
Now this peace is established within you and
you become, it’s a new dimension of existence,

01:04:10.762 --> 01:04:12.272
where you become “thoughtlessly aware”.

01:04:12.272 --> 01:04:15.732
You are absolutely aware, but no thoughts.

01:04:15.732 --> 01:04:17.382
Just in peace.

01:04:17.382 --> 01:04:28.442
But you are aware; you are not fainted down
or you are not in some sort of a trance.

01:04:28.442 --> 01:04:37.952
You are absolutely aware and very much more
aware because, you are in Reality.

01:04:37.952 --> 01:04:42.761
Then the second dimension you achieve is that
you start feeling on your fingertips this

01:04:42.761 --> 01:04:46.222
cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

01:04:46.222 --> 01:04:48.271
Sometimes you feel it hot, also.

01:04:48.271 --> 01:04:55.761
On these fingertips are your sympathetic centres.

01:04:55.761 --> 01:05:01.061
And these Sympathetic Centres are from left
and right.

01:05:01.061 --> 01:05:05.281
They join together to make the Parasympathetic.

01:05:05.281 --> 01:05:12.742
So we have the left side and the right side
within us, and these left and right side,

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:15.442
indicates on our right and left side.

01:05:15.442 --> 01:05:22.351
On the left side we get our emotional and
the right side our mental.

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:27.222
I mean English Language, “mental” means
something different, but I mean whatever we

01:05:27.222 --> 01:05:29.251
do with our brain.

01:05:29.251 --> 01:05:36.131
And also you receive your physical problems
on the right hand side.

01:05:36.131 --> 01:05:40.031
These problems are indicative on your fingertips.

01:05:40.031 --> 01:05:49.241
Said it by Hazrat Mohammed that at the time
of Qiyamah your hands will speak and will

01:05:49.241 --> 01:05:53.692
give witness against you; means they will
tell you what’s wrong with you.

01:05:53.692 --> 01:05:59.041
But not only that; they also tell you what’s
wrong with others.

01:05:59.041 --> 01:06:05.901
Now somehow if you know how to correct these
centres, you’re all right, and correct the

01:06:05.901 --> 01:06:10.431
centres of others you can also make them all
right.

01:06:10.431 --> 01:06:14.732
It’s so simple, it’s all within you, all
the mechanism is within you.

01:06:14.732 --> 01:06:16.442
It’s all there.

01:06:16.442 --> 01:06:20.641
Only thing you have to understand the importance
of it.

01:06:20.641 --> 01:06:22.921
Without that you can never be happy.

01:06:22.921 --> 01:06:27.031
This power, which is there, is the power of
pure desire.

01:06:27.031 --> 01:06:31.712
All other desires are not pure.

01:06:31.712 --> 01:06:34.842
Today we want to have say; some flowers.

01:06:34.842 --> 01:06:38.232
Tomorrow we want to have a house; the day
after tomorrow we want to have helicopter.

01:06:38.232 --> 01:06:41.622
I don’t know; we go on and on.

01:06:41.622 --> 01:06:46.582
So every desire, which is fulfilled, is never
satisfied!

01:06:46.582 --> 01:06:47.822
Once we get it, it’s finished.

01:06:47.822 --> 01:06:53.781
Then again of course, it’s a law of economics
also, that in general, wants are not satiable.

01:06:53.781 --> 01:06:55.251
It’s a fact.

01:06:55.251 --> 01:06:59.051
But this desire, whether you know it or not,
is within you.

01:06:59.051 --> 01:07:05.082
Whether you are aware of it or not, is the
desire to be one with this all-pervading power.

01:07:05.082 --> 01:07:10.822
And all the powers that you have within you
start manifesting.

01:07:10.822 --> 01:07:16.732
You have no idea at all what powers you have.

01:07:16.732 --> 01:07:22.261
I always say about a television taken to a
very remote village in India where they have

01:07:22.261 --> 01:07:24.531
never seen electricity.

01:07:24.531 --> 01:07:29.322
And if you tell them that in this box you
can see some films, they’ll say, “What,

01:07:29.322 --> 01:07:31.242
this is just a box!

01:07:31.242 --> 01:07:32.811
What are you telling us stories?”

01:07:32.811 --> 01:07:37.761
We also feel we are just a box, nothing more
than a box.

01:07:37.761 --> 01:07:40.891
But do you know what powers you have within
yourself?

01:07:40.891 --> 01:07:44.092
What you can do for this world?

01:07:44.092 --> 01:07:49.051
What can you do for yourself, to your family,
to your children?

01:07:49.051 --> 01:07:58.611
How you can really be a great force of reforms
and transformation without troubling anybody?

01:07:58.611 --> 01:08:03.621
Because, after this you know the absolute
truth.

01:08:03.621 --> 01:08:06.371
You know them on your fingertips.

01:08:06.371 --> 01:08:12.261
If a man from India comes from the jail, he’ll
directly come either to Australia or he will

01:08:12.261 --> 01:08:20.852
go to America, wear a dress of a what you
call this saddhu baba dress in saffron colour,

01:08:20.852 --> 01:08:24.671
and go and sit in any place and become a big
guru.

01:08:24.671 --> 01:08:27.431
Earn a lot of money.

01:08:27.431 --> 01:08:36.592
How will you know if this fellow has been
to jail, or is he a real person or not?

01:08:36.592 --> 01:08:42.871
So on your fingertips you can find out the
absolute truth.

01:08:42.871 --> 01:08:53.122
A new dimension in you, that on your fingertips
you know not only your centres, but the centres

01:08:53.122 --> 01:08:54.181
of others.

01:08:54.181 --> 01:08:58.092
Everybody feels the same way, knows the same
way.

01:08:58.092 --> 01:09:03.012
Then where is the quarrel, where is the argument,
where is the war?

01:09:03.012 --> 01:09:09.992
Now we have in India sometimes, people coming
from sixty nations because Sahaja Yoga is

01:09:09.992 --> 01:09:11.522
now practised in sixty nations.

01:09:11.522 --> 01:09:15.872
I’ve never seen them quarrelling, fighting,
of course they pull each other’s leg and

01:09:15.872 --> 01:09:22.702
have a little humor about it, but never have
I seen fighting, never!

01:09:22.702 --> 01:09:25.582
No question, no question of argument.

01:09:25.582 --> 01:09:31.031
Because, you do not know the absolute truth,
so somebody says that Christianity is good,

01:09:31.031 --> 01:09:37.061
somebody says this Islam is good, somebody
says that is good or democracy is good, or

01:09:37.061 --> 01:09:38.222
communism is good.

01:09:38.222 --> 01:09:39.222
How?

01:09:39.222 --> 01:09:43.621
How do you know that?

01:09:43.621 --> 01:09:48.511
Because you have got yarn in your heads, and
that’s how you’re formed your own ideas

01:09:48.511 --> 01:09:51.222
and you’re all fighting with each other.

01:09:51.222 --> 01:09:54.031
It’s all mental, which is all limited.

01:09:54.031 --> 01:10:00.411
But, with this, you know the Absolute and
is tangible.

01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:02.051
You can diagnose people.

01:10:02.051 --> 01:10:12.121
One fellow went to Huston and he said “Mother,
I was half dead with diagnosis only.

01:10:12.121 --> 01:10:14.931
But I said, “You don’t have to do anything
in Sahaja Yoga like that.

01:10:14.931 --> 01:10:17.962
You can diagnose about yourself, you can diagnose
about others.

01:10:17.962 --> 01:10:22.131
There’s no need to go through all that.

01:10:22.131 --> 01:10:27.421
This is what it is that you have to have your
own powers manifesting.

01:10:27.421 --> 01:10:31.171
And you must have the full knowledge about
it.

01:10:31.171 --> 01:10:34.781
It should not be half way.

01:10:34.781 --> 01:10:42.752
Your attention becomes extremely innocent
and powerful.

01:10:42.752 --> 01:10:48.721
The attention, when it is diverted everywhere;
you see you get confused and people get schizophrenia,

01:10:48.721 --> 01:10:49.721
this, that; all that.

01:10:49.721 --> 01:10:58.791
But here the attention is very innocent and
such a person, even if he radiates or even

01:10:58.791 --> 01:11:06.822
if he looks at or glances at somebody; he
can give peace; he can give redemption; he

01:11:06.822 --> 01:11:13.221
can do so many things, he can do, because
his attention has become enlightened.

01:11:13.221 --> 01:11:17.151
Sitting down here you can know about anybody
you want to know.

01:11:17.151 --> 01:11:22.661
You can know about the people who are dead,
or the people who are very far away.

01:11:22.661 --> 01:11:30.301
You can find out sitting down.

01:11:30.301 --> 01:11:33.632
This is what we can call as “collective
consciousness”.

01:11:33.632 --> 01:11:39.901
A new dimension of consciousness comes to
you about which Jung has written, collective

01:11:39.901 --> 01:11:41.381
consciousness.

01:11:41.381 --> 01:11:44.521
So you develop this collective consciousness
within yourself.

01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:48.732
For that you don’t need any education, you
don’t need anything.

01:11:48.732 --> 01:11:49.732
Even villagers can do it.

01:11:49.732 --> 01:11:53.741
Even small little children can do it, because
they know this power.

01:11:53.741 --> 01:11:59.391
As all of us have the power to see something,
as you all can see me sitting down here, in

01:11:59.391 --> 01:12:09.921
the same way you can know about others; know
about yourself; without doing any acrobats.

01:12:09.921 --> 01:12:15.751
So simple as that, all these powers are your.

01:12:15.751 --> 01:12:22.212
But above all, you jump in the Sea Of Joy.

01:12:22.212 --> 01:12:29.401
The whole problem is taken over by this all-pervading
power of God.

01:12:29.401 --> 01:12:31.732
We say we leave it to God, all right, leave
it to God.

01:12:31.732 --> 01:12:33.271
But you are not connected.

01:12:33.271 --> 01:12:36.822
When we pray also we are not connected.

01:12:36.822 --> 01:12:42.311
You know a telephone, which is not connected,
you go on moving it, it will get spoiled but

01:12:42.311 --> 01:12:43.952
you are not connected.

01:12:43.952 --> 01:12:51.041
After realization, even to, just a problem
comes to you and it gets solved, because you

01:12:51.041 --> 01:12:55.761
get out of your problem and you can see it
clearly and the Divine helps you.

01:12:55.761 --> 01:13:03.281
There have been so many blissful miracles
of Sahaja Yogis that now we have given up.

01:13:03.281 --> 01:13:07.713
We wanted to print them, but in one month
they became so much high and we didn’t know

01:13:07.713 --> 01:13:08.901
what to do.

01:13:08.901 --> 01:13:17.282
So, all over we have to not believe in God,
but you have to feel the bliss of God; how

01:13:17.282 --> 01:13:19.671
He looks after you.

01:13:19.671 --> 01:13:25.871
It’s not just a talk or a sermon, but it’s
a happening and the happening has to take

01:13:25.871 --> 01:13:30.842
place; otherwise our attention, which is outside,
will not be taken inside.

01:13:30.842 --> 01:13:37.091
It’s a question of understanding our own
value, respecting ourselves.

01:13:37.091 --> 01:13:39.341
And it works.

01:13:39.341 --> 01:13:42.151
As you all are here I know you are all seekers.

01:13:42.151 --> 01:13:44.452
Otherwise you would not be here.

01:13:44.452 --> 01:13:48.151
And it is your right to get this realization.

01:13:48.151 --> 01:13:52.942
Sahaja means “born”: ‘sah’ is with
you; ‘jah’ is “born”.

01:13:52.942 --> 01:13:54.861
“With you” is “born”.

01:13:54.861 --> 01:13:59.871
This right to get to this yoga, means the
union with the Divine.

01:13:59.871 --> 01:14:05.362
And is your right and you should assert and
all those who will ask for it have to have

01:14:05.362 --> 01:14:06.362
it.

01:14:06.362 --> 01:14:07.552
It is their right.

01:14:07.552 --> 01:14:10.972
The whole thing has built in our evolutionary
process.

01:14:10.972 --> 01:14:18.151
And now, the last bit has to happen and it
will work out.

01:14:18.151 --> 01:14:22.572
I have to tell you one thing more; that it
is not an individual happening.

01:14:22.572 --> 01:14:24.902
It’s a collective happening.

01:14:24.902 --> 01:14:28.412
It works better when there are many people.

01:14:28.412 --> 01:14:33.962
Also when you have to know about it, learn
about it, take advantage of it, you have to

01:14:33.962 --> 01:14:35.121
come to the collective.

01:14:35.121 --> 01:14:40.562
It’s not like other organizations where
they have an introductory lecture and after

01:14:40.562 --> 01:14:42.202
that they start marketing it.

01:14:42.202 --> 01:14:44.111
You cannot market it.

01:14:44.111 --> 01:14:47.442
For definite, you cannot market it.

01:14:47.442 --> 01:14:49.092
It is divine love.

01:14:49.092 --> 01:14:52.962
And love you can never market.

01:14:52.962 --> 01:14:57.732
In the same way this is Divine Love; how can
you market it?

01:14:57.732 --> 01:15:03.892
So, if you have respect for yourself, if you
really love yourself, and you care for yourself,

01:15:03.892 --> 01:15:11.532
you are not self-centered because after all,
you are a human being; epitome of evolution.

01:15:11.532 --> 01:15:19.032
So, only thing you have to give some time
and come to the collective and progress in

01:15:19.032 --> 01:15:20.032
Sahaja Yoga.

01:15:20.032 --> 01:15:21.402
It’s not difficult at all.

01:15:21.402 --> 01:15:27.572
Nothing is to be done as I told you; it’s
not to stand on your head or anything.

01:15:27.572 --> 01:15:29.522
Just wherever you are, you’ll get it.

01:15:29.522 --> 01:15:31.782
It’s so simple.

01:15:31.782 --> 01:15:34.782
Because the time has come.

01:15:34.782 --> 01:15:37.642
And you are not obliged to me buying for anything.

01:15:37.642 --> 01:15:44.892
It’s just happening, happening all over
and happens to everyone.

01:15:44.892 --> 01:15:48.582
So I would request you to pay attention to
it.

01:15:48.582 --> 01:15:53.372
And once you get your realization, you should
really come to the collective because it would

01:15:53.372 --> 01:16:01.092
be like what Christ has described as sprouted,
seeds which were thrown somewhere and were

01:16:01.092 --> 01:16:05.552
lost, so you have to grow, and that growth
is important.

01:16:05.552 --> 01:16:11.142
Once it happens, if you have any concern for
your country, for yourself and for the world,

01:16:11.142 --> 01:16:14.722
you should try to keep to it and understand.

01:16:14.722 --> 01:16:17.182
It’s as simple as that.

01:16:17.182 --> 01:16:22.912
So the last thing as I told you, jump in the
ocean of joy.

01:16:22.912 --> 01:16:29.642
That is, when your ego is pampered you feel
happy and when the ego is punctured, you feel

01:16:29.642 --> 01:16:30.782
unhappy.

01:16:30.782 --> 01:16:32.842
It is joy, has no duality.

01:16:32.842 --> 01:16:36.272
It’s just a witness state in which you witness
everything like a drama.

01:16:36.272 --> 01:16:43.792
And you lose your age very much.

01:16:43.792 --> 01:16:47.502
You feel very dynamic; at the same time very
compassionate.

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:52.372
As you know I’m seventy-one years of age
and I’m traveling practically every third

01:16:52.372 --> 01:16:53.372
day.

01:16:53.372 --> 01:16:54.372
And it’s all right.

01:16:54.372 --> 01:16:55.852
People said “Mother, don’t you feel you
are traveling too much?”

01:16:55.852 --> 01:16:58.232
I said, “I’m not traveling, I’m just
sitting everywhere.

01:16:58.232 --> 01:17:01.202
Where am I traveling?”

01:17:01.202 --> 01:17:03.702
In the same way, it happens to you.

01:17:03.702 --> 01:17:10.422
And the ageing and all that never comes into
your mind.

01:17:10.422 --> 01:17:14.972
You just live; live in the present.

01:17:14.972 --> 01:17:20.472
And you just enjoy life; enjoy the company
of all other realized souls.

01:17:20.472 --> 01:17:21.792
All over the world you have relations.

01:17:21.792 --> 01:17:27.392
Wherever you go they’ll be all there to
help you, to look after you.

01:17:27.392 --> 01:17:32.282
Something happens to one person, all over
the world they will try to help, the doctors

01:17:32.282 --> 01:17:40.272
will run to that place, people will pray,
and I mean they will see to it that the person

01:17:40.272 --> 01:17:41.272
is saved.

01:17:41.272 --> 01:17:48.142
It’s such a big family, such a beautiful
family into which I would request you to join.

01:17:48.142 --> 01:17:57.582
May God bless you!

01:17:57.582 --> 01:18:07.292
Now, I cannot force self realization, cannot
be done, because I respect your freedom.

01:18:07.292 --> 01:18:14.882
You are given freedom at a human level because
you have to ascent with your own, with your

01:18:14.882 --> 01:18:19.762
own desire, I cannot force on you anything.

01:18:19.762 --> 01:18:28.272
As you have to accept it that you want to
have it.

01:18:28.272 --> 01:18:33.312
I would request people who don’t want to
have it, they should leave the hall and leave

01:18:33.312 --> 01:18:38.952
others, but those who want to have it are
very welcome, and they can have it.

01:18:38.952 --> 01:18:44.722
Even the knowledge they can have it without
any difficulties.

01:18:44.722 --> 01:18:53.082
So all those who want to go away should leave
the hall, please, I will be very thankful,

01:18:53.082 --> 01:18:56.512
because it cannot work on people who do not
want it.

01:18:56.512 --> 01:19:01.462
On the contrary it doesn’t help others also
to have such people among you who don’t

01:19:01.462 --> 01:19:11.092
want to have it.

01:19:11.092 --> 01:19:20.942
It will take hardly ten minutes and I would
request you not to disturb others when we

01:19:20.942 --> 01:19:23.552
are in the process of it.

01:19:23.552 --> 01:19:30.352
Actually it happens spontaneously without
anything but as there are little problems

01:19:30.352 --> 01:19:36.262
on the centers, you have to nourish your centers
yourself as I’ll tell you, its very simple

01:19:36.262 --> 01:21:53.692
and will show you how we do it.
