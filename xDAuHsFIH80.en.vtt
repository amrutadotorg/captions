00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.680
Hello, hello

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:52.420
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I want to welcome you here on behalf of sahaja yoga, in Victoria

00:18:53.100 --> 00:19:00.600
and in particular to draw to your attention to the fact that we have now in our midst

00:19:00.800 --> 00:19:08.480
a very great personality, whose affect on hundreds and thousands of people round the world has been

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:12.720
quite dynamic and in many respects, unbelievable.

00:19:13.960 --> 00:19:20.520
Now the Russians have flooded into sahaja yoga,

00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:26.860
the Europeans in 64 countries is operative,

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:31.540
it's a very, very big undertaking in India

00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:37.400
and it's on these occasions that one realizes the immense importance of

00:19:37.900 --> 00:19:41.460
uh.. the individual life and the collective life

00:19:41.760 --> 00:19:46.860
and how these are now coming together in a very, very positive way.

00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:54.820
When our friend Steven here was talking to you about the nature of the inner

00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.940
quality of dynamic, which we call the Kundalini and the chakra system

00:20:01.340 --> 00:20:06.380
that we're looking at something which has been embedded in human-beings

00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:13.000
and has been awakened through the great historical periods by dynamic and

00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:21.020
uh.. highly spiritual avatars. Each of these chakras represents a stage in human development

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:29.100
and they're all there in every human-being. Not only that the power of the Kundalini

00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:37.040
is so uh..as we are aware, spread throughout the whole of the human race and it's importance is so great

00:20:37.300 --> 00:20:43.040
that when one sits awake and all those distinctions of race, of class,

00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:51.300
of wealth, of poverty, of importance in society, are illuminated

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:55.760
and the human-being can, for the first time,

00:20:56.040 --> 00:21:03.520
uh.. actually move into the consciouness of what the real self is, not the self which sits on the surface,

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.280
the self which belongs to the ego

00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:12.240
and the emotions, but the real self which is hidden deeply in the unconscious

00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:17.100
and these two things are dynamic of that Kundalini awakening

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:23.700
and the entry into consciousness of the operations of the real self

00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:29.060
which, in fact, is linked with all other human-beings and all life,

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:35.920
is one of the great opportunities offered in this great critical time at the end of the twentieth century.

00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:42.100
Now this history, if you like, of the

00:21:43.900 --> 00:21:49.320
human-being in our civilization has been one from this operation

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:54.640
as it were of the left side to the dynamic of the right side.

00:21:54.800 --> 00:22:01.400
The left side with it's emotion is particular quality of civilization is taken quite a number of centuries.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:07.340
If you look at human-beings in our Western world today, they're functioning with this ego,

00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:15.480
the personal consciousness and the dynamic of the right side or if we use the Sanskrit term, the Rajoguna,

00:22:15.860 --> 00:22:22.520
dynamic and externally oriented. And when one takes one's attention away

00:22:22.840 --> 00:22:28.440
as it were with [UNCLEAR - ROSETTE] from that externality, one has the chance

00:22:28.680 --> 00:22:32.320
in meditation to reach the real center.

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:38.800
If you look at the history of civilization, you'll find that it's either the left or the right side,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:43.500
through great periods of time, that's been dominated in the way people act and behave.

00:22:43.780 --> 00:22:49.140
In our centuries, the acuteness of the ego is so great

00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:55.620
that the ego now feels itself totally cut off from life, from other human-beings

00:22:55.900 --> 00:23:02.640
and from the whole web of existence. And the ecological problems which exist in our external world

00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:08.860
and in nature are brought by the industrial society and expression of the fragmentation

00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:13.340
which is going on within the human-being uh.. internally.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:19.620
Now sahaja yoga offers that wonderful opportunity of bringing

00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:24.800
consciousness back into the center. We have never really tried

00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:30.500
as a civilization, to operate in the dynamic reascending mode

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:38.200
which is this pathway here. And the purpose of the Kundalini is to pass through and awaken and cleanse

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:43.760
each of the chakras within this system and ultimately to provide

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:49.980
the total experience of what the self really is and that self is collective.

00:23:50.220 --> 00:23:55.700
It's not something which we can call uh the individual 'I' anymore, it's something which is

00:23:55.860 --> 00:24:02.800
deeply embedded in the whole totality of existence. Now, Shri Mataji is a remarkable figure,

00:24:03.020 --> 00:24:09.600
who in hundreds and thousands of instances has brought this realization

00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:15.220
to people all over the world. It is no longer an individual thing

00:24:15.440 --> 00:24:22.700
for a few people with a guru. It is now something to be experienced within the consciousness

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:29.520
of modern man in vast numbers. In fact, the very

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:37.280
uh.. existence of large numbers of people enhances the experience of this collective realization principle.

00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:43.240
So, I have the greatest pleasure in introducing this figure

00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:51.200
of world importance in, in the field of yoga - Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi. [CLAPPING]

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.660
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:19.200
At the very outset we have to know, that truth is what it is.

00:25:21.080 --> 00:25:26.260
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it

00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:34.020
and unfortunately, at the level of human awareness, we cannot know it.

00:25:36.060 --> 00:25:40.400
The reason is, as they have explained to you already,

00:25:40.660 --> 00:25:48.060
that these two things called conditionings and the ego, are covering our brain.

00:25:49.260 --> 00:25:56.060
Apart from that, we are not connected to the All-Pervading

00:25:56.300 --> 00:26:00.760
power, which is the love of God.

00:26:02.180 --> 00:26:07.260
In these modern times to talk of God, is something out of trade

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:12.920
and also there are many people who have talked about God,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:18.900
established religions, established all kinds of huge, big organizations

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:23.260
and people have discovered that there's no truth in it.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:31.640
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:26:37.240 --> 00:26:44.460
At the very outset we have to know, that truth is what it is.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:51.620
We cannot change it, we cannot transform it

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:59.000
and unfortunately, at the level of human awareness, we cannot know it.

00:27:01.140 --> 00:27:05.320
The reason is, as they have explained to you already,

00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:10.180
these two things called conditionings and the ego

00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:15.720
are covering our brain. Apart from that

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:22.940
we are not connected to the All-Pervading power, which is

00:27:24.260 --> 00:27:32.280
the love God. In these modern times, to talk of God is something out of trade.

00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:37.920
and also there are many people who have talked about God

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:44.140
established religions, established all kinds of huge, big organizations

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:48.120
and people have discovered that there's no truth in it.

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:56.320
It's not based on truth though the Incarnations, prophets

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:04.460
all of them have been expressing nothing but truth, manifesting nothing but truth.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:11.260
But somehow or other, all these organizations have deviated and what is the reason for that?

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.760
The reason for that is simple thing which was important,

00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:24.560
is that one has to go beyond this human awareness

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:31.500
through their Self-realization, through their second birth or as Walihood, as they call it in Islam.

00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:38.160
This was not at all attempted, nor the attention paid

00:28:38.400 --> 00:28:41.480
to such an important thing, that we have to

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.640
get our Self-realization, that we have to be connected to this All-Pervading power of God.

00:28:49.740 --> 00:28:56.540
That's why they deviated into, I think, two three things, firstly it deviated into many orientation.

00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.700
It became the thing where people must make money.

00:29:01.260 --> 00:29:09.000
And such horrible things they have done, it's surprising how could they do it, when they were professing truth.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:18.540
The second was that they wanted to have power - they did for power so they mixed up politics, this that - such a mixture of things.

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:26.460
But they are not spirit oriented - they didn't work out that you have to be the spirit.

00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.680
Now this mechanism exists within you, I say so, but you shouldn't take it for granted,

00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:41.000
you shouldn't believe Me blindly but you must experience yourself, if it is so.

00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:49.260
Like a hypothesis you can accept what I am saying but supposing I prove it, then you have to accept it as honest people.

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:56.140
Because it is for your benevolence, is the benevolence of this Australia, benevolence of the whole world.

00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:02.380
This is what we have been waiting for all these days, this is being promised to us in all the scriptures.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:09.620
But instead of seeking that, people have deviated into businesses or into political organizations

00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:19.220
which is a very unjust, unfair treatment to Divinity.

00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:28.680
This Divinity resides within you all, as shown here, is within you.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.600
This power is within you, is your own power.

00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:39.520
Maybe, I just trigger it like one enlightened light can enlighten another light

00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.340
but is within you, residing just like a primule in a seed.

00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:52.580
And whatever powers you get afterwards, when you are connected to the mains, are also within you.

00:30:55.260 --> 00:30:59.900
You are not to feel obliged to Me nor am I in any way obligated to you.

00:31:00.500 --> 00:31:04.340
It's just that it is your own,

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:09.640
this is your own property and that the key has to be found.

00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:17.200
Of course you can't pay for it - one must understand you can't pay for a higher awareness.

00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:22.780
What can you pay? It's something so natural - it's a living process

00:31:23.060 --> 00:31:28.080
and what do we pay to this Mother Earth for sprouting a seed - She doesn't understand even.

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:35.340
So you can't pay for it - first of all understand that it is not something material that you can buy

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:39.040
but it's your own energy which has to manifest it.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:47.160
Tomorrow, of course, I'm going to tell you about what is the nature of the spirit

00:31:48.140 --> 00:31:55.600
but today I've just to tell you one thing that this Kundalini is within you

00:31:56.840 --> 00:32:03.940
and when She rises, she definitely solves your physical, mental, emotional problems,

00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:11.440
also your material problems but above all your spiritual urge.

00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.400
They say that, in this

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:21.700
Kaliyuga, ghor Kaliyuga - these modern times - this

00:32:22.580 --> 00:32:28.160
work will be done - is already been predicted

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:35.660
that people who were seeking the truth in the hills and dales

00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.720
will find it within themselves, as ordinary householders.

00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:46.860
And that's what I find, is so easy. The time is such

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:51.880
that it is working out in such great numbers.

00:32:53.300 --> 00:32:59.660
Surprisingly, in a place, which we call the country called Russia

00:33:00.060 --> 00:33:08.080
where they had never heard about God, they were not supposed to think about God, they were not supposed to even utter the word God

00:33:09.220 --> 00:33:15.820
where thousands and thousands have got realization and such seeking.

00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:23.440
I was wondering, what is the thing that they have that they should in thousands should come to these

00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:29.640
lectures of Mine and I had to arrange them in stadiums - never in a hall like this.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:36.160
And the way they got their realization is very surprising - how they got it.

00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:42.340
Because they said, "Mother, we have nothing to do with spirituality,

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:48.580
we never heard there is something higher than this human awareness and how do we get this."

00:33:51.640 --> 00:33:59.660
I said, 'There must be something special about you.' And the special about them, I think, that they were kept out of materialism.

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:04.560
They have everything provided for, whatever is necessary.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:11.320
Moreover, they are very introspective by nature, extremely introspective. If you read their

00:34:11.720 --> 00:34:17.520
writers like Tolstoy or anyone, even the hero will introspect himself.

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:24.600
This introspection has brought forth such personalities that they are finding,

00:34:24.880 --> 00:34:29.700
one thing in common, that they haven't found out the Absolute Truth.

00:34:31.120 --> 00:34:35.880
Whatever they know is on the relative terminology - even the Science.

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:41.560
Science, they think, is all the time changing, is nothing of a permanent nature.

00:34:41.840 --> 00:34:48.840
And when I address there, the Scientists, they said, "Mother, tell us everything else but not Science - we had enough of it."

00:34:49.460 --> 00:34:55.780
So this is what it is, that we have to see also what all these enterprises we have entered into.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:35:04.580
Like Science, what has happened to us. Today we have created a big devil there, atom bomb and here a Hydrogen bomb sitting on our head.

00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:11.180
We have created those devils and they are frightening us. We have created these ecological problems.

00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.260
We have created this political problems, economical problems ourselves.

00:35:16.320 --> 00:35:21.660
That means, something wrong with human-beings, that means, they haven't found the Absolute.

00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:26.860
So, this human-being has to be transformed.

00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:32.340
This transformation once takes place, you become the Spirit.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:39.980
It's question of becoming, it's not just giving a sermon or a lecture or anything like that - it's, it should happen to you.

00:35:40.760 --> 00:35:47.400
From this human awareness you have to become a higher personality, which is a spiritual awareness.

00:35:48.640 --> 00:35:56.380
This can happen very easily. Sahaja means also very easy, simple - also it means born with you.

00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:03.500
So you all have a birthright, you're born with this birthright, to get your Self-realization.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:12.340
For that, you do not have to pay, do not have to exert, it's, it's absolutely effortless

00:36:13.320 --> 00:36:18.400
and also you do not have to think about it because it is beyond thinking.

00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:26.660
So many things people are talking about, so many theories -

00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:30.720
they talk of Capitalism, Communism, this ism, that isms,

00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:35.840
goes on like a yarn out of the brain comes out and everybody gets engulfed.

00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.680
Once it is written down, it becomes a Bible - people start following it but of no avail.

00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:51.220
Only compartments have been created - you are this, you're that, you're a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, this, that and all that - into compartments.

00:36:51.920 --> 00:36:59.220
Human-beings are divided by all this thinking - you are a Communist, you are a Capitalist, you're this, you're that - you're not.

00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:07.580
You are a human-being to begin with and you're the pure Spirit. And if the Spirit

00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:15.420
is the reflection of one God, then how can we be separated, how can we put into some compartments.

00:37:16.180 --> 00:37:20.800
We are part and parcel of one God Almighty.

00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.340
The microcosm has to become the macrocosm, that's all. This happening has to take place

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:32.380
where the drop of your personality has to become one with the whole.

00:37:33.040 --> 00:37:39.580
Also the concept of individuality is so wrong. This concept of individuality that we have

00:37:40.260 --> 00:37:48.280
is against the Spirit of the whole, absolutely against the Spirit of the whole but individuality,

00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:56.800
I mean, the way nature is individual in the sense every leaf is different from another leaf, every flower is different from another flower, to look at,

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:06.220
but in it's nature it is just the same - it comes from the same source.

00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:12.180
In the same way, we have to become the Spirit though we may dress up separately,

00:38:12.340 --> 00:38:19.820
differently - I mean, in sahaja yoga nobody is wearing funny dresses, you see, like regimentation or some sort of a uh..

00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:26.740
orange dress or nothing of the kind. It's not the dress that matters, it's something very much inside and innate.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:32.800
So the innate religion has to be awakened. Unless and until that innate religion is awakened -

00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:39.400
you may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim, anything - you can commit any kind of sin,

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:46.320
any kind of murder, any theft, anything that is all absolutely against the collective.

00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:54.380
Nothing stops you. That means whatever you're professing, is just outside, is just mental nothing has gone inside.

00:38:55.580 --> 00:39:02.420
Even if you are educated in that. You have seen the priest, you have seen the mullahs, you have seen all these people - they are so well educated -

00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.020
they do the same thing. What's wrong there?

00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:11.580
When they know this is right, why don't they do what is right?

00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:16.420
The reason is, they haven't got the power of the Spirit.

00:39:16.660 --> 00:39:22.780
In the light of the Spirit only, you become what you profess.

00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:32.120
You walk what you talk. We don't have to tell anyone that you do this and do that because they have the light.

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:39.020
In their own light they see the same thing, understand the same thing, they know what is right and what is wrong

00:39:39.320 --> 00:39:42.620
and what is good for you, what is for your benevolence.

00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:49.700
Of course, by the raising of this Kundalini, as I told you, many diseases can be cured physically.

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:57.120
We have three doctors in Delhi, those who have got M.D. after doing their M.B.B.S.

00:39:57.900 --> 00:40:04.620
in the subject of sahaja yoga. They have cured people of some incurable diseases.

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:11.980
And now, there are seven doctors in England, also we have doctors here, two or three, who are collecting datas to show how

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:18.320
sahaja yoga can cure you without wasting your time into something

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:24.340
that we call as the medicines and all artificial things.

00:40:25.800 --> 00:40:33.100
So many things can be done with your own power. You don't have to depend on anybody else

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:41.100
but the cleansing part of your being takes place when you become collective,

00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:46.580
when you are together. Like supposing, a nail of Mine is broken, it won't grow.

00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.800
It will be just left at the same point where it was thrown away.

00:40:53.100 --> 00:41:00.380
In the same way, if you are collective, the whole body of Spirituality will cleanse you completely,

00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:07.740
will manifest all your powers, will give you what you're worth.

00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:12.760
You have to know your glory, you have to know your beauty.

00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:19.880
And no use condemning yourself that, "I'm a sinner, I've done this wrong, that wrong." After all you're human-beings

00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:24.580
and as human-beings we're supposed to commit mistakes - we're not Gods.

00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.140
So those people who tell you that, "You're a sinner, this thing, that thing," should see their own sins.

00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:37.240
So please have no diffidence about yourself, no diffidence at all.

00:41:37.540 --> 00:41:42.980
I assure you all of you can get realization, if you can just get over your diffidence.

00:41:43.980 --> 00:41:51.360
It's one thing we have to accept that we're human-beings and we are

00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:59.180
the epitome of evolution. We have evolved up to this state and a little more is needed which is

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:07.340
very easy and should happen to you - is already built-in within you, is already there. For example, see this instrument is

00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:13.540
made but if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning. In the same way you're to be put to the mains

00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:19.840
and this All-Pervading power about which I'm saying, we start feeling it for the first time.

00:42:20.900 --> 00:42:24.960
We see these beautiful flowers all around, we take them for granted.

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:32.180
How have they come out of this Mother Earth which looks so gross and out of one seed?

00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.220
How these different flowers have come with different personalities?

00:42:37.620 --> 00:42:42.120
We take them for granted. All the living work we take it for granted,

00:42:42.320 --> 00:42:48.040
even ourselves. Look at our eye, what a camera it is! Look at our brain,

00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:58.480
what a computer it is! We take it for granted. Why? Because we have no answer - we cannot say how.

00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.900
But in sahaja yoga we'll know how it works out. I hope, you all will take your realization

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:11.260
and tomorrow again I'll tell you all about the Spirit, what the Spirit is.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:16.260
You don't have to take Me for granted, again I'm saying that - blind faith is not needed

00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:22.940
but as Scientist you must keep an open mind to test for yourself and see for yourself.

00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:32.380
It will hardly take ten minutes, maybe, five minutes also for you to get your realization. There is no

00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:41.460
necessity for you to have any kind of a reading done or any kind of a uh.. penance done.

00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:50.520
As long as a human-being, you're a human-being and that you desire, very strongly,

00:43:50.760 --> 00:43:54.600
your Self-realization, nothing more is needed.

00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:58.920
This Kundalini is the power of your pure desire.

00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:03.440
All other desires are not pure because they're never satiable.

00:44:04.460 --> 00:44:11.980
So, this pure desire should be in your heart that, "I should get my Self-realization and let my, all my powers manifest."

00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:17.820
I think, we can have some little time for questioning

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:24.840
but please don't ask Me unnecessary questions to waste time for everyone because

00:44:27.740 --> 00:44:32.300
it's easy to answer because I'm now quite an expert

00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:39.120
I've been working on this for twenty one years and I know all the Western minds how they work and the Eastern minds how they work

00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:46.720
and I can answer all your questions still, I would request you that it's not important.

00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.100
Even if I answer you, even if you are satisfied mentally

00:44:53.220 --> 00:44:56.980
still, it's no guarantee that your Kundalini will rise.

00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:05.040
Main thing is that your Kundalini must rise and you must get your Self-realization, which is the actualization of baptism.

00:45:05.460 --> 00:45:13.440
Is actualization, it is not just putting My hand on your head and say that now you have got your realization or you have got your baptism.

00:45:14.580 --> 00:45:21.800
This is what it is, so I would request you, if you have any questions, do ask Me, please. Thank you very much.

00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:35.340
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What did he say?
  -

00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:41.680
- When You raise the Kundalini, don't you automatically raise the impurities and the chakras as well?
 - Yeah.

00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:48.420
You see, the Kundalini is to be understood in a very proper way.

00:45:48.720 --> 00:45:55.300
These are the chakras, say on the Left Sympathetic and the Right Sympathetic, when they meet they make the Parasympathetic Nervous System

00:45:55.400 --> 00:46:02.400
and these are the centers. Now, when you start using too much of right or left side, then what happens that they become constricted.

00:46:02.900 --> 00:46:08.820
Now, when the Kundalini rises, She doesn't rise the whole of Her own body -

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:16.120
it's like many strings put together like a rope - so some strings rise and they try to expand

00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:23.760
this space by nourishing those centers but completely they're not nourished,

00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:30.440
not nourished fully. Some people do have very beautiful uh.. balanced life,

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:38.800
they do get it but not mostly, they don't. So what happens, when the Kundalini rises, She passes through the, nourishes there

00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:45.040
and pierces through your fontanel bone area but it's a very small thread, I should say, in the beginning

00:46:45.520 --> 00:46:50.800
which passes through the very, very subtle uh.. channel, we call as Brahma nadi.

00:46:51.020 --> 00:46:55.440
When it pierces through, then it opens this,

00:46:55.920 --> 00:47:03.100
I should say, the, as the ego and conditioning part of it, these two open out and this thousand petalled

00:47:04.740 --> 00:47:10.140
chakra, we call as the Sahastrara, the thousand petalled lotus also opens out.

00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:17.260
When it opens out it gets connected, of course, but the connection is not established fully.

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:24.300
Even if you connect this, it may not be if it is little faulty, may not be established. So it has to be established.

00:47:24.560 --> 00:47:31.540
That hardly, it takes a  month at the most, for some people it doesn't even take one day, even one minute.

00:47:31.920 --> 00:47:40.060
So depends on. So we have to pay respect to ourselves and understand that if there's any problem, doesn't matter, we should correct it.

00:47:40.640 --> 00:47:45.440
Then also you must know, what it is. You must have the full knowledge as to

00:47:46.100 --> 00:47:52.400
what is this Kundalini, what you have achieved, what are your powers, how can you work it out

00:47:52.680 --> 00:47:58.320
everything you must know because once you're enlightened, you should be able to give light to others.

00:47:58.880 --> 00:48:06.220
After this happening, you can give realization to others - you get that power - you can cure people, you can put them right.

00:48:06.520 --> 00:48:14.360
Even a person who is spiritually so awakened, even if he enters any place, peace comes in,

00:48:15.160 --> 00:48:18.520
balance, equilibrium even in the nature comes in.

00:48:19.160 --> 00:48:23.640
So, such a personality if you create within yourself,

00:48:24.140 --> 00:48:30.220
you have to do it and that if it is required little time, you should give that time to yourself.

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:36.540
And then, when in a full way you become a really a Divine personality.

00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:45.380
That's what we have to achieve but you don't have to give up your families, you don't have to give up your anything - it's something that happens within yourself.

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:51.320
And that should happen to all of us. It makes no difference what age you are, it makes no difference

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:57.160
what race you are, nothing of the kind. As long as you are a human-being, it works out.

00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:09.460
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:17.760
The question is, what is actually the meaning of the term realization and what actually is happening.

00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:21.620
We have told them.

00:49:21.960 --> 00:49:29.020
Actually happening is the awakening of the Kundalini and you are getting connected to the mains, means the All Pervading power,

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.260
which is all the time flowing through you.

00:49:32.460 --> 00:49:39.680
Now, what is Self-realization, that I'm going to tell you tomorrow, as I said, but in short is that you know about your own centers.

00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:45.060
You become aware of yourself firstly.

00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:49.800
Many things happen but one of them is, on a physical level you know.

00:49:50.060 --> 00:49:54.860
Now people get cancer they don't know if they're getting cancer, they become mad they don't know they're becoming mad.

00:49:55.560 --> 00:50:03.580
But you become knowledgeable, you can feel it, on your finger-tips you can feel it - your centers and the centers of others

00:50:04.200 --> 00:50:09.600
so that you become collectively conscious. Your conscious, consciousness

00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:17.300
is so much enlarged that you can feel the centers of other people. Sitting down here you can feel the centers of others.

00:50:17.520 --> 00:50:21.120
Then you don't talk about a person as an Australian, Indian or anything

00:50:21.360 --> 00:50:26.840
but you will say that this center is not all right, that center is not all right, this center is very good.

00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:31.120
This is the language you start talking about.

00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:38.760
And what happens is, such a lot, that in one lecture I don't think I can cover it.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:46.420
But tomorrow, I'm sure, I'll be able to tell you elaborately what all the good things happen to a person who is a Self-realized.

00:50:49.440 --> 00:50:55.140
First you get your Self-realization, is better. For example, you see here beautiful lights are here

00:50:55.880 --> 00:51:00.620
and when you come, you have to just switch on one switch

00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:05.840
because it's all built-in there, it's there existing.

00:51:06.300 --> 00:51:10.860
What's the use of telling about all the history of these lights and the history of electricity

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:18.100
and all how it came here to Melbourne and how it was brought here. Better have your lights first and then we'll talk about it

00:51:19.460 --> 00:51:22.640
otherwise it will be boring.

00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.220
Any more questions?

00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:42.440
I'm saying that [UNCLEAR]

00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:50.540
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:57.660
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:57.920 --> 00:52:05.760
[UNCLEAR]

00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:13.260
[UNCLEAR]

00:52:13.520 --> 00:52:21.500
- I didn't follow him.
 - The questioner is a little uncertain about the nature of the term

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:27.440
desiring the Spirit. In order to achieve the Spirit, you have to desire it

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:33.820
and that you have to have a purity of Spirit in order to achieve the Spirit.

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:39.900
You see, why I said you have to desire because God has given you freedom.

00:52:40.680 --> 00:52:45.360
I cannot be disrespectful to that freedom.

00:52:46.200 --> 00:52:50.820
If you don't desire, I cannot force on you, cannot be done.

00:52:56.180 --> 00:52:59.080
You have to ask for it.

00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:08.620
It cannot be forced, it cannot be... we cannot mesmerize people, we cannot do something like that,

00:53:09.220 --> 00:53:12.720
you cannot force people, you cannot dominate -

00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:19.020
it is your will which has to come. Only through your sweet will it will work out.

00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:32.860
And do you know that many have written about this - like William Blake has written

00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:41.560
that, "Men of God," - it's a special category of people  who are seekers of truth, it's a special category. He's described them

00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:47.080
as, "Men of God will know God and they'll have powers to make others Godly."

00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:53.220
So many have said about this in India also but I must say William Blake was a great seer

00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:57.520
that he could see this so clearly what was going to happen in the future.

00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:09.920
[INAUDIBLE]

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:14.360
- Why not have faith in Western medicine?
 - Annh?

00:54:14.600 --> 00:54:19.980
- Why not have faith in Western medicine?
 - You should, why not. I did also western medicine, you must have.

00:54:20.360 --> 00:54:26.980
But I'm saying, your faith in Western medicine is all right but they have no control over Parasympathetic Nervous System.

00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:31.920
There're many things which cannot be answered by medical sciences

00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:36.300
but if we can manage it with something else, why not do it.

00:54:48.020 --> 00:54:55.420
- So quiet [UNCLEAR] They're in thoughtless awareness
 - Looks like questions are finished.
  - [SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS] All right.

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:09.360
Agnya chakra which is shown there. Then what happens

00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:15.520
that these two conditioning and ego, these two institutions are sucked in like that.

00:55:18.100 --> 00:55:22.040
With that you achieve a state which we call as

00:55:23.260 --> 00:55:28.200
thoughtless awareness, called as 'nirvichar samadhi' in Sanskrit language.

00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:33.420
Thoughtless awareness, means you are absolutely aware but there is no thought.

00:55:33.700 --> 00:55:40.140
Otherwise we are always bombarded with thinking. Thoughts are coming whether you like it or not - you can't stop it.

00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:47.600
Now, thoughts come either from the future or from the past.

00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:55.960
In the present if I say, "Stop your thought," you cannot. And you cannot be in the present unless and until you stop your thoughts.

00:55:57.300 --> 00:56:02.340
So, the first state that comes to you, that you become thoughtlessly aware

00:56:02.660 --> 00:56:08.420
means you have a command over your thoughts. If you want you'll think otherwise you'll not think.

00:56:09.740 --> 00:56:14.240
And you grow spiritually only when you are in the present.

00:56:14.620 --> 00:56:19.520
If I say, "Pay attention to yourself," you can't. Say, "How to pay attention inside?"

00:56:21.840 --> 00:56:29.540
But supposing Kundalini rises, then the attention, which we can say, like a sari like this and it pushes up

00:56:30.320 --> 00:56:35.680
the attention. Attention, here, when it reaches

00:56:37.040 --> 00:56:44.940
then the Grace starts falling or you can say the light starts falling on the attention and your attention becomes enlightened.

00:56:47.200 --> 00:56:52.760
but you are in thoughtless awareness state.

00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:58.860
Afterwards, when you have established your connections properly

00:56:59.420 --> 00:57:04.800
then you are in the second state, that we call as doubtless awareness.

00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:11.940
And this doubtless awareness state in which you start manifesting all your powers -

00:57:12.300 --> 00:57:15.740
and this is what we have to achieve,

00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:24.620
which is very easy, works out in a very simple way; of course, you don't have to pay at all for that.

00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:33.220
And it works wonderfully because you get the proof of it.

00:57:36.240 --> 00:57:43.760
You get these powers working and you understand that these powers are working.

00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:52.820
You have to certify yourself - nobody is going to give you the certificate. It is you who's going to decide it.

00:57:55.500 --> 00:58:02.920
Is it all right now, should we have the session for Self-realization?

00:58:06.680 --> 00:58:14.560
- Second [UNCLEAR]
 - [INAUDIBLE]

00:58:14.800 --> 00:58:19.860
[INAUDIBLE]

00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:27.440
Can you achieve a balance of the chakras through mantras and meditation or singing?

00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:33.940
Of course, but it's a science; One has to know what to do exactly.

00:58:34.200 --> 00:58:38.700
It's not just say any mantras. You see, these, there are people giving mantras

00:58:39.260 --> 00:58:43.640
for 300 pounds or 6000 pounds - I mean, nonsense it is.

00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:52.300
And mantras are related to your chakras, which you yourself will know.

00:58:53.020 --> 00:58:57.780
But mostly it is not needed. If it is needed, you have to, may also have to do

00:58:58.140 --> 00:59:02.440
some sort of a asana, as Hatha yoga is but very rarely.

00:59:03.900 --> 00:59:10.900
So mantras do not play much role, unless and until, you have that problem then you have to use the mantras

00:59:11.260 --> 00:59:16.620
but which is the chakra for which you need, you have to find out first of all.

00:59:16.900 --> 00:59:24.240
That's only possible when the Kundalini rises, then you know where there is obstructed, then you have to use a particular mantra - that helps.

00:59:24.620 --> 00:59:32.680
On the whole, all this knowledge is very easily available - it's not difficult - but first of all you must enter into the Kingdom of God

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:41.220
then you're looked after. Unless and until that has happened, is impossible - it will be just talk, talk and talk.

00:59:41.840 --> 00:59:46.700
And you have had many talks, it should not be another talk to you

00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:52.420
but it should happen - is the becoming.

00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:05.440
All these things which we have known, part here, part there, something false, something true.-

01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:09.900
in the light you see everything so clearly.

01:00:12.440 --> 01:00:18.360
In the darkness of ignorance, you believe this is true, this is true, that should be such

01:00:18.600 --> 01:00:25.500
but what you need, is the enlightened mind. Once you're enlightened, you are a different person altogether.

01:00:33.940 --> 01:00:40.420
So now, please don't get worried

01:00:40.840 --> 01:00:46.360
about yourself. You are all going to get your Self-realization.

01:00:47.400 --> 01:00:51.580
Don't doubt yourself. That's the first condition is, relax.

01:00:52.500 --> 01:00:57.880
Don't doubt yourself. You're all going to get your realization.

01:00:59.140 --> 01:01:03.540
I have no doubts about it but if you doubt yourself, I can't help it.

01:01:05.300 --> 01:01:11.360
Must have full confidence in yourself - that is the first condition.

01:01:13.900 --> 01:01:17.960
The second condition is that,

01:01:18.920 --> 01:01:23.620
you're not to feel guilty about anything, whatsoever.

01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:37.460
It's a fashion these days also to feel guilty for nothing at all - specially in English language, we go on saying sorry, sorry, morning till evening.

01:01:38.020 --> 01:01:45.720
Even on the telephone you see now in Our times We used to say 'beg your pardon' but nowadays people say sorry for that also. I don't know

01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:49.340
for anything they go on saying sorry. What is there to be sorry about?

01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:55.540
So, in short, you have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

01:01:57.020 --> 01:02:02.860
Don't have any diffidence. Whatever has been a mistake is all right, has to be corrected

01:02:03.120 --> 01:02:10.360
and can be done very easily, if you have self-confidence. So please, don't feel guilty.

01:02:12.440 --> 01:02:18.680
Don't start confessing in your mind, what wrong you have done to yourself or anything - please, please, don't.

01:02:20.120 --> 01:02:27.620
And third condition is also very simple, if you understand, that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:34.820
Now, this people sometimes say is very difficult but logically understand.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:40.260
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - what do you do - nothing.

01:02:41.120 --> 01:02:44.260
But when you don't forgive, then you play into wrong hands.

01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:50.420
Those who wanted to trouble you, are happy while you are the one who is feeling extremely

01:02:50.660 --> 01:02:54.980
unhappy, all the time torturing yourself for the sake of others.

01:02:59.060 --> 01:03:04.780
So just forgive everyone - take it out of your mind. Now since I've come to Australia,

01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.320
I find, when I meet them, that they say, "Mother, difficult to forgive, difficult to forgive."

01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:17.580
I mean, there's nothing difficult - it's your own mental nonsense - throw it away.

01:03:18.140 --> 01:03:25.900
You'll feel so much lighter just now. Just say, "I forgive everyone." All those nonsensical people you need not even think of.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:32.640
In general, you should say, "I've forgiven everyone," and you'll be very much better off.

01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:37.580
These are the only three conditions, which are very easy - everybody can do it.

01:03:41.400 --> 01:03:48.400
Now, I have to request you, that you have to take out your shoes, if possible, because this Mother Earth really helps us a lot.

01:03:55.060 --> 01:04:00.300
Now those who are sitting on the ground, it's all right but those who are not sitting on the ground, have to know

01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:04.660
that you have to put your -

01:04:11.700 --> 01:04:16.180
you can come in front, if you like, can come in front -

01:04:17.980 --> 01:04:25.140
uh.. put your left foot away from the right because the left side represents

01:04:26.840 --> 01:04:34.400
our power of desire. Now, medical science doesn't make difference between the left lobe and the right lobe of the brain but we do.

01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:44.300
So we have to put the left foot away from the right foot and

01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:53.440
we have to use our left hand to express our pure desire to get Self-realization -

01:04:53.960 --> 01:04:56.920
is to put your left hand like this,

01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:05.520
just like this as he's showing, left hand and the right hand is

01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:10.640
the power of action. So, we'll use our right hand

01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:14.320
to give nourishment to our centers.

01:05:18.600 --> 01:05:25.000
This is to be done only today not all the time. Once you're realized, you don't have to do all this.

01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:32.640
This is just for your realization and also for you to know how you can raise your own Kundalini just now.

01:05:34.200 --> 01:05:41.460
So now, the left hand is towards Me suggesting that you are desirous of having Self-realization

01:05:43.160 --> 01:05:47.380
and the right hand is to be used for your action.

01:05:50.020 --> 01:05:58.020
I've already told you that I respect your freedom and those who do not want to have Self-realization

01:05:58.800 --> 01:06:02.480
should not watch others and sit here.

01:06:03.140 --> 01:06:08.720
They should go and that would be very civil of them, to do. But those who want

01:06:12.620 --> 01:06:18.160
can have it very easily. But

01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:24.600
whatever we get so easily without paying anything, sometimes we do not have respect for that.

01:06:25.760 --> 01:06:31.660
But you don't know, this is the most precious thing to become a Spirit

01:06:32.180 --> 01:06:39.500
and we should really respect the Self-realization and try to expand our awareness.

01:06:41.660 --> 01:06:46.380
So please, put left hand towards Me and now the right hand on your heart.

01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:50.880
In the heart resides the Spirit.

01:06:58.320 --> 01:07:04.700
If you become the Spirit, you become your own guide, your own master, your own guru.

01:07:05.980 --> 01:07:10.580
So, take your right hand in the upper portion of the abdomen

01:07:12.520 --> 01:07:20.180
which is the center of - on the left hand side. We're working only on the left hand side - which is the center of your mastery.

01:07:22.120 --> 01:07:28.600
Then you take your hand in the lower portion of the abdomen on the left hand side. This is the center

01:07:30.780 --> 01:07:38.240
of pure knowledge - knowledge of the Divine laws and how to work them out.

01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:44.660
When you get your Self-realization, you'll find,

01:07:44.880 --> 01:07:49.340
first time you'll feel this All-Pervading power on your finger-tips,

01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:54.900
Also you'll find a cool breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area,

01:07:55.620 --> 01:07:59.060
maybe warm in the beginning but later on cools down.

01:08:00.220 --> 01:08:07.120
So, this power that you get, you should know how to use it

01:08:07.660 --> 01:08:13.860
for your benevolence and for the benevolence of others. This is the pure knowledge.

01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:19.260
Now, please take your hand in the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side

01:08:22.360 --> 01:08:26.340
and now again on your heart.

01:08:34.040 --> 01:08:41.180
Now you have to put your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder and turn your hand to your right.

01:08:43.500 --> 01:08:50.720
This center is caught up when you feel guilty and it's a very dangerous thing because

01:08:51.160 --> 01:08:58.660
when this, this center is out of gear, you get a horrible disease called Angina,

01:08:59.120 --> 01:09:06.940
you get spondylitis, also you get very lethargic organs. So please don't feel guilty.

01:09:07.820 --> 01:09:13.300
Now, raise your hand to your forehead across, put your thumb on one side

01:09:13.980 --> 01:09:18.780
and the fingers on the other and press it hard. Now, put it down your head.

01:09:19.720 --> 01:09:23.480
This is the center for forgiving others.

01:09:25.640 --> 01:09:32.680
Now, take this right hand - I'm just showing you now  and then we'll do it and I'll explain to you -

01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:40.980
on the back side of your head. Now, push back your head as far as possible. This is the center,

01:09:42.700 --> 01:09:48.600
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, only for your satisfaction

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:52.520
you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading power.

01:09:54.040 --> 01:10:01.420
Now, stretch your hand fully - the palm is to stretch fully -

01:10:01.660 --> 01:10:08.960
and put the center of your palm on the fontanel bone area, which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:10:09.520 --> 01:10:16.920
Now, put down your head as far as possible, now press it hard, your scalp, by pushing out

01:10:17.260 --> 01:10:25.900
your fingers outward. Now, this is very important - push them out and now press it and move your scalp seven times -

01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:33.120
you will know the reason for all this, why seven times you have to move it.

01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:40.260
Press your scalp and put down your head -

01:10:40.740 --> 01:10:46.340
clockwise, move it clockwise, seven times. That's all you have to do, that's all.

01:10:58.140 --> 01:11:04.660
Now, we have to close the eyes. You can take away your spectacles,

01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:08.720
please see that your both the feet are away from each other.

01:11:09.820 --> 01:11:17.020
If there's anything tight on your neck too much or on your waist, you can loosen it little bit and you have to be comfortable,

01:11:17.400 --> 01:11:24.280
not to slouch nor to stretch too much but in a comfortable state, way, you have to sit down.

01:11:26.660 --> 01:11:33.620
Now, please put the left hand towards Me, right hand on your heart and close your eyes.

01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:38.400
Here, you have to ask Me a question in your heart -

01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:44.660
you may call Me Mother or you may call Me Shri Mataji, whatever you feel like.

01:11:45.260 --> 01:11:52.040
Ask a question in your heart, three times - a very fundamental question about yourself

01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:55.520
"Mother, am I the Spirit?"

01:11:55.740 --> 01:12:01.560
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question three times in your heart.

01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:30.740
If you are the Spirit, you are your master. So please, put your right hand

01:12:30.980 --> 01:12:37.040
on the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side and press it with your fingers - not very hard.

01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:45.580
Here you ask another fundamental question in your heart, three times, "Mother, am I my own master?"

01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:50.160
With full confidence ask this question.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:05.140
Again, I cannot cross over your freedom - I respect it

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.880
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you - you have to ask for it.

01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:18.540
So, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

01:13:19.500 --> 01:13:22.840
on the left hand side. Here

01:13:24.620 --> 01:13:29.400
please say six times because this center has got six petals.

01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:39.380
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge. Mother, please give me pure knowledge," ask this six times.

01:13:49.400 --> 01:13:55.780
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, the Kundalini starts moving upward.

01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.340
So now,

01:14:02.460 --> 01:14:07.620
with full confidence you have to open your higher centers.

01:14:09.100 --> 01:14:13.880
Please, raise your right hand on the left hand side

01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:18.300
of your abdomen in the upper portion and press it hard.

01:14:20.700 --> 01:14:26.960
Here, you have to say with full confidence, ten times,

01:14:28.160 --> 01:14:33.480
"Mother, I am my own master." Say it with full confidence,

01:14:34.520 --> 01:14:42.320
complete self-confidence. "Mother, I am my own master." You have to say it ten times.

01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:54.060
We have to know that we are not this body, this mind,

01:14:54.560 --> 01:15:01.060
this intellect, emotions, conditionings, ego

01:15:01.720 --> 01:15:05.480
but we are pure Spirit.

01:15:07.600 --> 01:15:14.100
This is the fundamental truth about yourself. So now, please raise your right hand

01:15:14.860 --> 01:15:20.660
on your heart and with full confidence say, twelve times,

01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:26.720
please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

01:15:27.160 --> 01:15:31.660
Please say it twelve times, "Mother, I am the,

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:36.080
I am the pure Spirit," twelve times, please.

01:15:47.160 --> 01:15:54.340
Another thing we have to know that this All-Pervading power of God's love,

01:15:54.880 --> 01:16:00.900
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and bliss

01:16:01.240 --> 01:16:08.560
but above all, it is the ocean of forgiveness and whatever mistakes we might have committed

01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:14.840
can be easily dissolved by the power of this ocean of forgiveness.

01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:21.960
So, please forgive yourself and now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder,

01:16:23.280 --> 01:16:27.800
push it as far back as possible and turn your head to your right.

01:16:29.740 --> 01:16:32.880
Here, you have to say sixteen times,

01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.080
with full confidence, "Mother, I am not guilty at all."

01:16:44.780 --> 01:16:47.780
Please say it sixteen times.

01:16:49.480 --> 01:16:54.060
You don't judge yourself, let your Kundalini judge.

01:16:55.340 --> 01:17:02.300
"Mother, I am not guilty at all," please say it sixteen times.

01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:07.500
This center has the maximum number of petals - sixteen petals.

01:17:07.820 --> 01:17:14.500
This center looks after your ear, nose, throat, face, everything, your tongue, your eyes.

01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:29.100
I have already told you whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything

01:17:29.400 --> 01:17:33.560
but if you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands

01:17:35.720 --> 01:17:43.180
so, in general, you have to forgive everyone not remembering anyone of the people who have troubled you.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:47.180
Now, raise your right hand

01:17:47.900 --> 01:17:53.080
on your forehead, across, put your thumb on one side

01:17:55.020 --> 01:17:59.560
and fingers on the other. Now press it hard.

01:18:00.460 --> 01:18:03.800
Please bend your head as far as possible.

01:18:06.180 --> 01:18:10.920
Here, without thinking of anybody else

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:17.940
just, in general, you have to say, "Mother, I forgive everyone."

01:18:19.700 --> 01:18:27.260
or, "Mother, I forgive everyone in general." Say it from your heart, not how many times but from your heart.

01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:47.400
Now, please take your hand on the back side of your head and push it back as far as possible.

01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:56.860
Here, without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes, you have to say

01:18:59.600 --> 01:19:05.560
with full confidence, "Oh Divine power, please forgive me

01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:11.960
if I have done anything wrong against you knowingly or unknowingly.

01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:19.400
"Oh Divine power, please forgive me if I have done anything wrong against you

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:27.360
knowingly or unknowingly." This you're going to say for your satisfaction from your heart - not how many times.

01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:42.560
Now the last center which is very important. Please stretch your hand

01:19:48.240 --> 01:19:55.680
and put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was the soft bone in your childhood.

01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:06.300
Please put down your head as far as possible, push back your fingers.

01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:22.600
Please push back your fingers, put a good pressure on your scalp. Here again, I respect your freedom -

01:20:23.620 --> 01:20:29.720
I cannot force Self-realization on you so you have to say seven times,

01:20:30.080 --> 01:20:36.040
"Mother, please give me Self-realization, my second birth,"

01:20:37.220 --> 01:20:43.400
and you just move your scalp, very slowly, seven times,  saying that.

01:20:48.720 --> 01:20:52.940

Now, please take down your hands. Put both the hands towards Me, like this.

Open your eyes, you can wear your spectacles also. Put both the hands towards Me, like this.

breeze like waves coming from your head.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:07.760
Bend your head and see for yourself. Don't put your hand on top of your head, away from it.

01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:14.720
Some people get it far away, some get it nearer. Just see, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming inside.

Again with the right hand, please try again with the right hand.

01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:08.500
See yourself, if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming.

01:23:21.100 --> 01:23:28.940
and ask a question, three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

01:23:31.460 --> 01:23:36.920
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the All-Pervading power of God's love?"

01:23:37.980 --> 01:23:45.380
Or you can ask, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya?" Ask anyone of these questions. These are the names of only one

01:23:45.800 --> 01:23:53.620
thing which is the All-Pervading power of Divine love which does all the living work.

01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:57.360
Just ask anyone of these questions, three times

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:08.120
Push back your head towards the sky. Please, put down your hands now.

01:24:10.340 --> 01:24:13.440
Just put the hands like this.

01:24:17.360 --> 01:24:23.660
You can become thoughtless, you can watch Me without thinking. Just put [UNCLEAR]

01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.300
Now, those who have felt - please put down your hands

01:24:31.760 --> 01:24:35.200
Put your hands like this. Now,

01:24:37.180 --> 01:24:44.540
those who have felt cool or warm or hot breeze like waves

01:24:44.780 --> 01:24:48.960
on the fingers, on the hands

01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:54.460
or out of the fontanel bone area please raise both your hands.

01:25:00.680 --> 01:25:05.560
So, that's it! May God bless you!

01:25:05.820 --> 01:25:10.260
Everyone seems to have got it except for very few people who haven't.

01:25:11.500 --> 01:25:17.700
Very few didn't get it - doesn't matter, you'll get it tomorrow, it's all right.

01:25:18.320 --> 01:25:24.640
You shouldn't doubt, that's the main point is the doubting and you should forgive, most of you.

01:25:25.480 --> 01:25:30.860
Except for 3-4 people, I think, most of you have got it so, May god bless you!.

01:25:32.580 --> 01:25:37.440
I hope to see you tomorrow again and tomorrow

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:41.740
I'll meet all of you, individually, all of you.

01:25:42.220 --> 01:25:49.240
Now, you have to inform your friends and everyone, that they should come and we should have more people

01:25:51.220 --> 01:25:56.700
because I'm here only for tomorrow and then I'll come back after two years,

01:25:56.900 --> 01:26:03.400
one year. I shouldn't say two years, will  be too much. All right, so I would request you

01:26:03.640 --> 01:26:10.080
that you should inform your friends, you should inform your relations

01:26:10.420 --> 01:26:13.720
because this is the only thing you can give it to them.

01:26:14.980 --> 01:26:18.560
Now, you have reached a state where you are thoughtless,

01:26:18.860 --> 01:26:25.920
so don't argue with people who haven't got it. Those who haven't got it will also get it tomorrow and those who have got it,

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:31.240
should know that you have to maintain it - like keeping the peace in your heart

01:26:31.640 --> 01:26:35.040
and not arguing about it and quarreling with others

01:26:35.280 --> 01:26:40.420
because those who won't get it will start saying something - doesn't matter, makes no difference.

01:26:40.740 --> 01:26:46.720
You have got it, so keep your experience with yourself and we have to share it with others, so many

01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:49.960
in Melbourne. May God bless you!

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:53.120
Tomorrow
