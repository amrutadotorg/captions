Shri KRISHNA PUJA
Primordial Taboos and Sahaj Dharma

3
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,810
August 23, 1997 – CABELLA, Italy

4
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:31,840
Lecture starts here:

5
00:04:52,449 --> 00:04:59,449
Today we are here to celebrate Krishna Puja.
I went to America and they wanted Me to have

6
00:05:16,749 --> 00:05:23,749
a Mahakali Puja. But I said, “No, let Me
talk about Krishna only.” Because we have

7
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:33,990
to first realize what is the strength of this
Puja, how are we going to establish Shri Krishna

8
00:05:39,749 --> 00:05:42,449
within ourselves.

9
00:05:42,449 --> 00:05:49,449
He Himself has said that “Whenever there
is a downfall of dharma.” Dharma doesn’t

10
00:05:50,129 --> 00:05:57,129
mean what we understand as Hinduism, Christianity
or Islamic nonsense - it is not. Dharma means

11
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:09,340
our primordial taboos that are built-in, in
the human beings. About these, I think aboriginals

12
00:06:15,129 --> 00:06:22,129
knew better than we. But then what we did,
we dominated them and also they had to change

13
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:31,090
their style of life. The primordial taboos
are only understood if people are trying to

14
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:43,120
understand oneself or else whatever has come
to them through tradition.

15
00:06:43,889 --> 00:06:50,889
Now, sahaj dharma is little bit different
in the sense that it’s much higher than

16
00:06:54,539 --> 00:07:01,539
the sahaj ideas that we talk of, but it’s
much higher than even what Shri Krishna said

17
00:07:04,729 --> 00:07:11,729
or Shri Rama said. First, Shri Rama thought,
best is to give them disciplines. People should

18
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:20,879
be serious about life, have full idea about
their own being, they should respect themselves.

19
00:07:24,279 --> 00:07:31,279
All these things were written down long time
back. Also, people, basically when they were

20
00:07:34,460 --> 00:07:41,460
good people, they understood that whatever
is bad for us, we should not do. These are

21
00:07:42,569 --> 00:07:44,219
primordial taboos.

22
00:07:44,219 --> 00:07:51,219
Now, these primordial taboos are built in
within us. Now, supposing I say, “Don’t

23
00:07:53,529 --> 00:08:00,529
drink.” You will go and drink. If I say,
“Don’t tell lies,” you will tell lies.

24
00:08:01,999 --> 00:08:08,430
It’s the human nature, you see, is to go
against primordial taboo, because they think

25
00:08:08,430 --> 00:08:15,430
now they have freedom, freedom to do what
they like. You are free people. Actually they

26
00:08:16,249 --> 00:08:23,249
are not. They are under the spell of all the
kinds of allurement, you can call it, or temptations

27
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:34,960
which are against human life. And it’s very
natural to be a person of dharma. Small children

28
00:08:40,450 --> 00:08:42,330
mostly have it.

29
00:08:42,330 --> 00:08:48,530
For example, I’ve seen children, they feel
very shy to take out their clothes - even

30
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:55,250
small, small boys, I’ve seen. They won’t
take out their clothes in the presence of

31
00:08:55,250 --> 00:09:02,250
others; they feel shy. So, all these are described
like, Ya Devi, Sarva Butheshu, Lajja Rupena

32
00:09:04,790 --> 00:09:11,790
Samsthita. So, you should be shy; you should
be humble and respect your body, it’s very

33
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:22,480
important in these modern times. Exposure
of body is regarded as a great achievement

34
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:29,480
of women. They are trying to become aboriginals,
you see. That time they never had these ideas

35
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:33,970
and they were not so confused, you see. So,
even if their women were scantily dressed,

36
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:40,970
it didn’t mean that it was some sort of
a sex or some sort of an attraction for men,

37
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:51,300
or men behaving in funny manners to show that
they have a special attraction for women.

38
00:09:54,040 --> 00:10:01,040
I mean, why should you? It is absolutely absurd
that men should be attracted to women and

39
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,760
women should be attracted to men - and on
the road, on the street, you go, you see,

40
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:17,760
just that going on! This adharma is the worst
I think, for it’s a curse. Because after

41
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:24,060
coming to Sahaja Yoga also people start doing
this nonsense, you know. They should all go

42
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:29,990
to lunatic asylum, I think, they are no good
for Sahaja Yoga. But dharma gets established

43
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:33,140
as soon as you have the light of the spirit.

44
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:40,140
At the time of Shri Rama, He had to put down
A, B, C, D, E, F. At the time of Moses, also

45
00:10:47,870 --> 00:10:54,870
He had to put down Ten Commandments. But Krishna
thought the other way round - to establish

46
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:05,330
a dharma of pure love - pure love. So, because
He wanted that Shri Rama’s taboos were forced

47
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:18,240
on people, just like Islamic, just like Christians
- never works. So, He thought better to ask

48
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:27,050
them in their freedom, they must develop pure
love. Radha, who was with Him as His power,

49
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:37,200
is called as Alladhadayini. She’s the one
who gives joy - pure joy!

50
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:44,550
So, all these limited type of attractions
end up in trouble. Now, drinking is against

51
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:54,480
you, you know that. Today they are talking
about tobacco, tomorrow they’ll talk of

52
00:11:54,480 --> 00:12:00,860
drinking when they will find so many people
suffering from horrible livers and dying.

53
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:07,860
Then they will taboo it. But it’s a natural
taboo for your body. If you do something all

54
00:12:10,090 --> 00:12:17,090
the time which is not good for you, for your
good life, you are becoming adharma.

55
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:28,540
This is to be understood very clearly that
the sahaja dharma is that you are just free

56
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:43,620
- complete freedom from lust, greed and all
nonsense. You’re above it. You’re above.

57
00:12:43,990 --> 00:12:50,990
This sahaj dharma is above the dharma established
by Shri Krishna or by Shri Rama, because you

58
00:12:54,180 --> 00:13:01,180
have reached that stage. Is in complete freedom
you have to be dharmic. Whatever is not good

59
00:13:03,260 --> 00:13:10,260
for you, you should not do. I don’t have
to tell you that you don’t do this or you

60
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:18,640
don’t do that. Whatever I say may not be
acceptable, but immediately your vibrations

61
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:20,090
will tell you.

62
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:27,090
This is sahaj dharma. In the sahaj dharma
you get rid of all kinds of, as they say:

63
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:35,710
kaama, krodha, mada, matsa, lobha, moha. Means:
lust, anger, attractions, then greed. Greed

64
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:54,270
- that’s very important, greed. Greed. And
attractions. Now, if you understand how people

65
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:10,420
are greedy, greedy for what? This America
is dying of consumerism, you see. Now, see

66
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:22,020
the trick of the trade. In America, you can
borrow any amount of money from the bank,

67
00:14:22,690 --> 00:14:29,690
no problem. Now, even if you don’t borrow,
they’ll send you a letter, “Why don’t

68
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:37,550
you take twenty thousand checks we are sending
you, why not have it? Ah, very rich you’ll

69
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:44,550
become, you see – it’s very nice to take
the loan.” I was told some people used to

70
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:53,160
come to Ganapatipule after taking loans. I
said, “Stop that nonsense!” So they take

71
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,160
the loan and then they come to Ganapatipule.
All the time their mind is: ‘How will I

72
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:08,090
pay this loan, how will I manage?’ All the
time the attention is distracted, even when

73
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:13,980
you want to do something good to yourself
of coming to Ganapatipule.

74
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:20,980
So, such a mind is not free. The free mind
is that which has attention completely enlightened

75
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:32,860
by the spirit. But problem is we are still
rising out of this human bondage to a higher

76
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:45,040
life of realization. And when we are going
to that level, we have to realize that we

77
00:15:50,090 --> 00:15:57,090
have to give up all these shackles, all these
horrible things within us. Like a bird, when

78
00:16:01,290 --> 00:16:08,290
it is born out of the egg, shakes out all
the parts of the egg. Your brothers, your

79
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:16,360
sisters, your father, your mother, your husband.
Everybody - they try to put you down. Now,

80
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,060
if they are drinking, they’ll say, “Come
along, you better have something to drink,

81
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:31,060
you are not social, you are useless, you are
not up to date. What is this nonsense?”

82
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:38,550
That’s how a fashion starts and this collective
action of fashion didn’t come from Shri

83
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,760
Krishna and not in Sahaj.

84
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:50,020
In Sahaj, you are absolutely free from all
these nonsenses. If you want, you can wear

85
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:57,020
a good dress, if you don’t want you need
not. You are free. You are free from money

86
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:08,230
bondage. This is very important. Money bondage
is another thing. I know some Sahaja Yogis

87
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:14,870
who came to Sahaja Yoga trying to make money
out of Sahaja Yoga. You came to Sahaja Yoga

88
00:17:14,870 --> 00:17:20,549
for what? To get out of that money bondage.
In the sahaj dharma, to you money is nothing

89
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:25,999
but the dust of your feet. Nothing so important.

90
00:17:25,999 --> 00:17:32,999
Then, we have such a collective sense of accepting
nonsense. That has to be dropped out, specially

91
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,480
in America, I was surprised. Also in England.
A fellow came as a hippie. His hair were looking

92
00:17:54,850 --> 00:18:01,850
like some monkey. Monkey is better I must
say. I don’t know like what, all put together

93
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:10,419
like a, you can say - there is nothing to
compare, I tell you.

94
00:18:10,419 --> 00:18:13,749
So I asked him, “Why are you having such
hair?”

95
00:18:13,749 --> 00:18:19,899
He said, “Because I want to be primitive.
Now, we have to get to the primitiveness.”

96
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:24,830
I said, “But your brain is modern, what’s
the use of growing your hair like that? You

97
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:31,259
think you can become primitive? You cannot!”

98
00:18:31,259 --> 00:18:38,259
Then afterwards I learned that he died. Another
one like that came and he didn’t die, but

99
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:48,200
went to lunatic asylum. Like that I met many,
but why do you do it? Because that’s the

100
00:18:49,570 --> 00:18:50,340
fashion.

101
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:57,340
Now Italy, you know, is prospering because
of all kinds of designers. Now there is a

102
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:06,249
joke about the n HYPERLINK "http://www.nouveauriche.com/"
ouveau riche people, in Russia especially.

103
00:19:06,249 --> 00:19:13,249
Russians are not like that, normally. They
don’t accept something because it’s a

104
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:21,240
fashion.
So, one fellow said that “My God you lost

105
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:29,909
your hand in that accident!”
“Doesn’t matter, but I lost my very expensive

106
00:19:29,909 --> 00:19:32,370
watch from Switzerland.”
“Really? What?”

107
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:39,370
“It was a Rolex.”
Doesn’t matter if the hand is gone. The

108
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:46,620
Rolex is gone - Rolex is the fashion.

109
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:50,690
So these are n HYPERLINK "http://www.nouveauriche.com/"
ouveau riche people who have money.

110
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:54,120
(Dog is on the stage)

111
00:19:54,120 --> 00:20:01,120
Come along. Come along. Sit down. Sit down.
Now, go down.

112
00:20:05,139 --> 00:20:12,139
They (the dogs) don’t form any fashions,
I have not seen dogs taken to any fashions.

113
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:21,159
Monkeys taking, I mean, supposing, you see
the Italian designers make something special

114
00:20:21,809 --> 00:20:28,809
for them, they won’t think much of it. Maybe
their masters might buy, but not these animals.

115
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:37,740
Now, we don’t have to become animals of
course, but we don’t also have to become

116
00:20:37,820 --> 00:20:39,149
slaves of fashions.

117
00:20:39,149 --> 00:20:46,149
So there are some shops which are very expensive.
Why? Because they are designers. So you move

118
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:52,320
about telling everybody, “See, I am wearing
this thing from a designer shop, this is from

119
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:59,320
designer shop.” That means, what about you?
You have no sense of designs; you have no

120
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:06,700
sense of understanding what you need and what
you don’t need. And nowadays most of them

121
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:13,909
are in jail also, sorry to say, but they have
money and they have made money by befooling

122
00:21:13,909 --> 00:21:14,740
you.

123
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:21,740
Specially in America I was surprised that
they were selling most of the things which

124
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:27,999
were coming from Italy - designs, Italian
designs, written that Italian design so they

125
00:21:27,999 --> 00:21:34,999
were buying it, Italian design. I was surprised
that such artistic things they create that

126
00:21:38,690 --> 00:21:45,690
are available everywhere, such beautiful things.
But what they believe in is some sort of a

127
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:55,659
group madness, everybody wearing the same
kind of design is from this or that. This

128
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:02,889
is not sahaj dharma. You are not slaves of
anything. You are free people. You have not

129
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:09,889
to accept any design or anything. Ah, it is
there, is there! Let the stupid follow that.

130
00:22:10,389 --> 00:22:12,279
We are Sahaja Yogis.

131
00:22:12,279 --> 00:22:19,019
Now, this also prevails among people who are
supposed to be sadhus, they all dress up the

132
00:22:19,019 --> 00:22:26,019
same way. How can you make out who is who?
In Sahaja Yoga, we don’t want you to dress

133
00:22:27,149 --> 00:22:33,480
up the same way, look the same way, cut your
hair the same way. No. You have to be individuals,

134
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:40,480
because you are free, but that doesn’t mean
- freedom is always supported by wisdom - that

135
00:22:42,100 --> 00:22:49,100
doesn’t mean that you do what you like.
All kinds of funny things happen when a person

136
00:22:50,850 --> 00:22:57,850
doesn’t know what is the light of the spirit.
In the light of the spirit, you don’t get

137
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:06,230
involved into this kind of collective madness
that is going on. We are so collective in

138
00:23:06,789 --> 00:23:12,379
mad things. I wish they could be collective
more in wise things.

139
00:23:12,379 --> 00:23:19,379
Wisdom is very important, and a joy-giving
quality of Radhaji - alladhadayini shakti

140
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:26,899
- has to come within us. Means, when we meet
another person in the collectivity, another

141
00:23:29,470 --> 00:23:36,470
person should feel happy with you. So He taught
the dharma of love. Love is not there if you

142
00:23:40,929 --> 00:23:47,929
discard because he is black or because he
is brown, because he is white. It’s very

143
00:23:49,779 --> 00:23:56,779
superficial - what is black, white and yellow?
I don’t understand. Here they go to the

144
00:23:58,059 --> 00:24:05,059
sea shores to make themselves black and there
they say, “we don’t want to have any blacks,”

145
00:24:06,149 --> 00:24:13,149
specially for Americans. I think this kind
of separation I found there, among the blacks

146
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:19,429
and the whites, I really wept.

147
00:24:19,429 --> 00:24:24,919
I went to Harlem. Sahaja yogis said, “Mother
will you go to Harlem?”

148
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:30,379
I said, “Why not, I’m black. If you call
Me black, I’m black. If you call Me white,

149
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:35,499
I’m white. If you call Me yellow, I’m
yellow, so I’m going.”

150
00:24:35,499 --> 00:24:39,700
And there I had a lecture, you know, so many
people were there, really I cannot forget.

151
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:46,700
It is one of the most famous place that there
is built in that hall and the same hall is

152
00:24:49,549 --> 00:24:56,549
built in Australia where I had addressed many
people. I thought, just look at this! They

153
00:24:59,179 --> 00:25:05,100
said, “Mother, the Australians copied from
us.” Now, these people, so sweet, so beautiful,

154
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:12,100
I tell you. I could see their heart, I could
feel it and the fellow was trying to compare,

155
00:25:12,629 --> 00:25:16,899
after My lecture he just came, he hugged Me,
kissed Me. I mean, he would have even minced

156
00:25:16,899 --> 00:25:23,639
Me, little boy about twenty-two years of age
- such love he felt. And he said, “Mother,

157
00:25:23,639 --> 00:25:30,639
next time You come, You are going to come
to Harlem.” But I am told that hall is closed.

158
00:25:31,259 --> 00:25:38,259
So the Americans system somehow or another
goes against democracy, not only against democracy

159
00:25:41,989 --> 00:25:48,989
but against what Abraham Lincoln wanted. They
had such a great man there and there is a

160
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:00,580
little street I saw in his name. Of course
in Washington they say they have some nice,

161
00:26:01,749 --> 00:26:08,749
beautiful statues. But otherwise his principles
are finished; his ideals are finished because

162
00:26:13,649 --> 00:26:20,649
somehow or other, some people came and wrote
against - England especially - against the

163
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:30,100
black people. What business they have to write
against something that is created by God?

164
00:26:33,429 --> 00:26:40,429
If there are the same colors everywhere, they
all will look like military people. They have

165
00:26:40,629 --> 00:26:46,850
to have different colors; they have to have
different hues. See, look at the trees; look

166
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:53,850
at the flowers. Look at the different hues
the sky has, just to make us happy – alladha.

167
00:26:56,669 --> 00:27:03,669
What gives you happiness is variety. Variety
is a sign of beauty. If there is no variety,

168
00:27:05,509 --> 00:27:12,509
it’s so boring I tell you, so very boring.
But they are very proud of it and they think

169
00:27:13,110 --> 00:27:19,110
no end of themselves. They think they are
very great people; they have a sense of superiority,

170
00:27:19,110 --> 00:27:26,110
because they have a certain type of nose or
maybe certain type of lips or maybe certain

171
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,360
types of hair. Such stupid things they are
and you join hands with them? How can you

172
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:40,210
join hands with them? You want your freedom?
Then be a free person. In the freedom you

173
00:27:40,210 --> 00:27:45,049
have to have variety, very important.

174
00:27:45,049 --> 00:27:52,049
I would say that now the Sahaja Yogis who
are going back to America should have a new

175
00:27:52,119 --> 00:27:59,119
style of drive; go to the black people. I
was very happy to see the South American seminar

176
00:28:01,029 --> 00:28:08,029
that they had taken specially to aboriginal
people. They went and met them. I have met

177
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:15,840
them also and I was so surprised that they
immediately said, “Mother, You are spiritual,

178
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:19,720
we know, but can You solve our problem?”

179
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:20,989
I said, “What’s your problem?”

180
00:28:20,989 --> 00:28:27,230
“Very simple, we have a land – all right,
then - very little land, five, six acres of

181
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:34,230
land that belongs to us where the sage grows.”
Sage is a kind of a, according to them, is

182
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:43,559
a holy plant. All right. “Now, we always
meet, all of us, there for different festivals

183
00:28:44,059 --> 00:28:49,710
because we regard that land as a holy land.”
They know so many things, you know. This is

184
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:56,690
a holy land; there were vibrations for that.
So they always used to meet, so natural.

185
00:28:56,690 --> 00:29:00,690
“So, what has happened now, what is your
problem?

186
00:29:00,690 --> 00:29:06,049
“The government has sold this land, this
American government, to an Indian.”

187
00:29:06,049 --> 00:29:08,320
I said, “To an Indian?”

188
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,970
“Yes, so can you request this Indian to
return it to us, we’ll pay him the money.”

189
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:17,289
I said, “What’s the name of the Indian?”
They told me the name, I said, “My God!

190
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:24,289
He is a Sindhi, Sindhi! He won’t leave you
even one single pai, is he going to give you

191
00:29:24,929 --> 00:29:31,519
this? I’m sorry, I may be divine or I may
be anything, I can’t help you.”

192
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:37,169
But I was surprised nobody raised a voice
against it. They should have raised voice.

193
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,929
They should have told the government, “Please
return their land. Why do you want to have

194
00:29:41,929 --> 00:29:48,179
it? Why want to grab it?” As it is all the
Americans are immigrants. They don’t belong

195
00:29:48,179 --> 00:29:55,179
to that place, that they were not owners of
that place, that ground - they are immigrants.

196
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:02,029
So they have no right to keep somebody’s
land like that and then to think they are

197
00:30:02,029 --> 00:30:07,009
superior. It’s very nice, somebody enters
your house and thinks he is very superior

198
00:30:07,009 --> 00:30:11,029
and drives out all the people of the family.

199
00:30:11,029 --> 00:30:17,299
That is what has happened in America and just
opposite is sahaj dharma. With sahaj dharma,

200
00:30:17,299 --> 00:30:24,299
you take people into your heart, you love
them. Your love flows all the time; your compassion

201
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:34,460
flows all the time. To Me it’s a problem,
this body is more compassionate than Myself.

202
00:30:34,460 --> 00:30:40,090
I don’t even think of compassion and this
body just grasps everything. It wants to solve

203
00:30:40,090 --> 00:30:46,960
the problem of others, but I don’t think
you can have that kind of a body, you shouldn’t

204
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:52,239
have. But, at least you should have a heart
which is open.

205
00:30:52,239 --> 00:30:59,239
You see on the street somebody who is a dark
fellow. I like about the black Americans that

206
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:06,279
once I got down in one airport, so one gentleman,
black gentleman, “Hello darling, how are

207
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:13,999
You? How are You here? Very happy to see You!”

208
00:31:13,999 --> 00:31:17,409
“I’m happy to see you. How are you?”

209
00:31:17,409 --> 00:31:24,409
Then once I was traveling in - what was the
airport? Ursula was with Me. So he looked

210
00:31:26,789 --> 00:31:33,789
at Me, one fellow, very tall, hefty, fat,
you know. He said, “Ah! Are You back again?”

211
00:31:35,779 --> 00:31:40,989
I said, “I’m back. You know Me?”

212
00:31:40,989 --> 00:31:47,989
“Of course, of course, I know you.” He
had never met Me, I had never known him. But

213
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:55,830
I felt happy, I felt very happy. That’s
the best way to meet people.

214
00:31:55,830 --> 00:32:01,840
Supposing you are walking on the street, you
see some black gentleman going. It’s a terrible

215
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:06,649
life there, I tell you; it’s a terrible
life for them. I’ve known, I’ve read books

216
00:32:06,649 --> 00:32:12,929
on them, I’ve cried and wept and I felt
very sorry. So, as a Sahaja yogi, you should

217
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:18,989
just jump at them and you should say, “Hello,
how are you?” Shake hands with them. They

218
00:32:18,989 --> 00:32:25,989
won’t cut your throat, I can tell you this.
In criminality, I don’t know who is more

219
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:32,779
criminal in America, whether they are the
blacks or the whites, competing. But, if you

220
00:32:32,779 --> 00:32:38,929
are kind and if you are loving, you can remove
that part of criminality which is within them

221
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:43,119
because hatred can be only washed away by
pure love.

222
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:50,119
But people think they are very cunning, very
superior - in cunningness, of course. Otherwise,

223
00:32:55,309 --> 00:33:00,499
what is their superiority? Only this complexion,
this white complexion is the worst of all.

224
00:33:00,499 --> 00:33:07,249
I was very fair, very fair, till I got married,
or for some time, and then I started becoming

225
00:33:07,249 --> 00:33:13,619
darker and darker. Because white complexion
gets all kinds of, see, the light you put

226
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:20,269
on Me, I absorb, I get a black spot. So it’s
not a very great thing to be white, I don’t

227
00:33:20,269 --> 00:33:27,269
think so. It looks very funny and pale and
joyless. But no use going to the sea, making

228
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:34,820
your body, I think brown - brown, not so black,
brown and then suffering from cancer of the

229
00:33:38,649 --> 00:33:44,229
skin. This kind of stupidity is also very
much fashionable.

230
00:33:44,229 --> 00:33:51,229
Now, in collectivity, how much do we get impressed
by these we should be on the watch. I saw

231
00:33:54,570 --> 00:33:56,850
My granddaughter was wearing a sleeveless
dress.

232
00:33:56,850 --> 00:34:00,070
I told her, “Better you shouldn’t wear
a sleeveless dress.”

233
00:34:00,070 --> 00:34:03,019
She says, “It’s very hot, I feel very
hot.”

234
00:34:03,019 --> 00:34:08,710
She’s young. I said, “But see, these are
two very important chakras. If you expose

235
00:34:08,710 --> 00:34:15,710
them, then you’ll have problem.” She doesn’t
like to wear dresses which are above the knee,

236
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:20,770
but she says people wear even above the knee.

237
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:26,859
I said, “Knees, they are very important
chakras, we should keep them clothed, otherwise

238
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:32,169
if they are affected, we’ll have knee trouble.”

239
00:34:32,169 --> 00:34:37,710
Immediately she changed, immediately. “Mother,
I’ll wear blouse from inside and something

240
00:34:37,710 --> 00:34:44,710
from outside.” Immediately. Because she
knew this is a natural primordial taboo that

241
00:34:45,990 --> 00:34:52,990
we should not expose ours - these two chakras
and these chakras. But, nowadays, the more

242
00:34:57,609 --> 00:35:04,609
you have long legs, I don’t know, they have
shorter clothes. And I don’t understand

243
00:35:06,319 --> 00:35:13,319
what is in the legs, the whole beauty is in
the legs or what?

244
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:21,410
So, I’ve met one lady who traveled with
Me. She was wearing a burqa because she was

245
00:35:21,470 --> 00:35:28,470
a Muslim. And by the time we landed in London,
she took out the burqa and the dress was much

246
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:35,559
above the knees. I said, “What kind of Muslim
woman is she? She’s worse than even Christians

247
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:43,670
because they wouldn’t wear such a thing,
you know, to come out of the aeroplane, you

248
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:51,410
have to come down on the staircase.” No
lajja, no shame, nothing, shamelessness!

249
00:35:53,869 --> 00:36:00,869
So, sahaj dharma is that you have shame, you
have sense of shame. What you talk to others,

250
00:36:02,569 --> 00:36:09,569
what you say to others, how you behave towards
them, in the sahaj dharma is alladhadayini.

251
00:36:09,770 --> 00:36:16,770
If something is not alladhadayini, keep quiet.
Don’t say. What is the need? What is there

252
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:26,480
to be sarcastic? Showing off your brains in
your sarcasm. It’s not a sign of good breeding

253
00:36:31,819 --> 00:36:38,819
that you talk sarcastically to others in a
sharp way. But if you talk sweetly, what’s

254
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:47,430
the harm? This sweetness comes from Radhaji.
Now, of course they have misused Her and made

255
00:36:49,369 --> 00:36:56,369
Her into a sort of a Romeo-Juliet business.
It was not that. She was a very pure woman

256
00:36:57,380 --> 00:37:04,380
and She was Mahalakshmi. So, to be a Mahalaksmi,
after coming to Sahaja Yoga, you should know

257
00:37:07,970 --> 00:37:14,970
that you should dress up in a way that’s
perfectly all right. Once I remember, I was

258
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:23,010
in a big party and one gentleman came and
he sat down, “Aaaaaah!”

259
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:26,150
I said, “What happened?”

260
00:37:26,150 --> 00:37:33,150
“What a relief, Mother, Mrs. Shrivastava,
to see You. See these women, I’m fed up.

261
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:40,480
But You came, I felt such a relief.”

262
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:43,819
I said, “What is so relieving?”

263
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:46,410
“You are so serene.”

264
00:37:46,410 --> 00:37:53,410
So, women are serene in sahaj dharma. They
are not stupid, frivolous, laughing at anything.

265
00:37:56,740 --> 00:38:03,740
That’s not the way for a woman. Anything
happens, they must laugh. I mean, there is

266
00:38:06,829 --> 00:38:10,109
something laughable, all right, but some things
are not even laughable, they'll laugh. That’s

267
00:38:10,109 --> 00:38:17,109
not the way. That can be ridiculous also,
can ridicule others. But laugh of appreciation,

268
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:26,160
laugh of enjoyment, is so pure and creates
such beautiful atmosphere. I think the whole

269
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:36,760
ecological problem is in our brains – [Hindi
words]. It is not outside. It is inside us,

270
00:38:41,430 --> 00:38:42,920
which is reflected outside.

271
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:49,500
In Ganesha Puja I’m going to tell you how
we are so closely related to Mother Earth

272
00:38:49,500 --> 00:38:56,500
and how the Mother Earth and the atmosphere
reacts to our behavior, to how we live. In

273
00:38:58,609 --> 00:39:05,609
the sahaj dharma, you give up lust and greed
very easily, that I know. I mean if they can’t

274
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:11,480
even give up that, then they should not call
themselves Sahaja yogis. The first thing you

275
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:18,480
give up is lust and greed. I find it among
young people now, that those who come to Sahaja

276
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:26,890
Yoga become really very free people. They
don’t run after women. Women don’t run

277
00:39:31,180 --> 00:39:38,010
after men. They are together, they sit together,
talk together, laugh together, but it is purity

278
00:39:38,010 --> 00:39:45,010
that is here. In the Koran it’s described
that “When Kiyama will come, beautiful women

279
00:39:48,450 --> 00:39:54,579
and beautiful men will be there, but they’ll
have no lust and greed, they’ll be pure.”

280
00:39:54,579 --> 00:40:01,579
Is today, you can see that that lust and greed
is finished in most of it, most of you. Automatically

281
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:12,770
it is finished and now you can see for yourself
that you’re free of this bondage.

282
00:40:13,910 --> 00:40:20,910
Then our marriages are coming tomorrow. In
the sahaj dharma, first thing is very important

283
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:40,130
is forgiveness. If somebody cannot forgive,
then he cannot be a Sahaja yogi. Forgiveness.

284
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:51,470
How this forgiveness comes in is by forgetting
the past. Otherwise you’ll go on saying,

285
00:40:52,819 --> 00:40:58,730
“This person tortured me, that person tortured
me, he was very mean to me, he was that to

286
00:40:58,730 --> 00:41:05,730
me, he did this to me.” Shows that you are
not of that caliber to understand Sahaja Yoga

287
00:41:06,510 --> 00:41:12,160
- because you cannot forgive. What is there
to remember? The present is the best. Now

288
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:18,450
if you are sitting here with Me, enjoying
the alladhadayini shakti, that time if you

289
00:41:18,450 --> 00:41:25,450
are thinking about the past, shows what? That
you are not of the caliber. To be the caliber

290
00:41:27,609 --> 00:41:34,609
of Sahaja Yoga, you should be free of your
past. Finished. There's no need to confess.

291
00:41:35,569 --> 00:41:42,569
I know after Sahaja Yoga many people wrote
letters to Me of confessions and I just said,

292
00:41:42,630 --> 00:41:47,960
“Baba, just burn these letters. I don’t
remember. I don’t want to read anything

293
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:48,510
about anything.”

294
00:41:48,510 --> 00:41:54,990
So, there should be forgiveness. If there
is forgiveness, you’ll be surprised, you’ll

295
00:41:54,990 --> 00:42:01,339
feel very relieved and your married life will
be very happy. But if you try to remember

296
00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:07,859
something – all right, some marriages are
really, really very difficult, all right,

297
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:14,859
so you get out. In Sahaja Yoga we have allowed
complete divorce, but must be with some reason,

298
00:42:14,869 --> 00:42:18,420
not because you think something is superior.

299
00:42:18,420 --> 00:42:24,390
Now we have banned many countries from where
we don’t want to have girls or from where

300
00:42:24,390 --> 00:42:29,660
we don’t want to have boys. What is the
reason? With experience we have learned, they

301
00:42:29,660 --> 00:42:36,660
are not marriage substance. Now, then better
not marry, and if you marry then live like

302
00:42:42,740 --> 00:42:49,740
an ideal Sahaja Yogi. Also, if you are a Sahaja
Yogini, then you can carry on very much better

303
00:42:51,799 --> 00:42:54,740
by forgiving all the time.

304
00:42:54,740 --> 00:43:01,740
Every time, when people tell Me, “My Mother,
You see You must help me.”

305
00:43:01,950 --> 00:43:02,400
“Why?”

306
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:05,119
“Because, You know my husband doesn’t
give me any money.”

307
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:09,619
I said, “Give him up. I don’t mind. He
must give you money. Why doesn’t he give

308
00:43:09,619 --> 00:43:10,520
you money?”

309
00:43:10,520 --> 00:43:15,670
If you talk to the husband, he’ll say, “Mother,
she’s very extravagant.”

310
00:43:15,670 --> 00:43:21,670
I said, “You better give up Sahaja Yoga
both of you and do what you like.”

311
00:43:21,670 --> 00:43:28,670
In sahaj dharma, the husband-wife’s relation
should be really romantic, should be really

312
00:43:29,619 --> 00:43:36,069
beautiful. It is not, you know, we talk of
love and all that here, very rarely people

313
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:42,059
fall in love and carry on with it. It’s
a blessing if you really get that kind of

314
00:43:42,059 --> 00:43:49,059
a feeling. But mostly it is a curse. So to
fall in love is very good but that doesn’t

315
00:43:53,230 --> 00:44:00,230
mean you forget that you are a Sahaja Yogi.
In that, Sahaja Yoga helps a lot, I think,

316
00:44:00,809 --> 00:44:07,809
in your married life. Same dharma is for your
children, that you bring up your children

317
00:44:08,660 --> 00:44:15,660
not troubling them too much, but into a free
land. Let them use their wisdom. Sometimes

318
00:44:16,369 --> 00:44:21,970
I know children go astray and try to follow
wrong things. Then you must correct them,

319
00:44:21,970 --> 00:44:28,200
you must tell them, it’s your duty. They
were not born out of the trees but they were

320
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:33,990
born here, from the parents. So it’s the
duty of the parents to tell them that this

321
00:44:33,990 --> 00:44:40,210
is wrong and this should not be done. It’s
a very wrong thing, you should correct them

322
00:44:40,210 --> 00:44:44,869
and that correction should be in a Sahaj way.

323
00:44:44,869 --> 00:44:51,869
I’ll tell you an example. I had a problem
once with somebody coming to Me and saying,

324
00:44:57,569 --> 00:45:04,390
“Mother, I can’t do without smoking, I
have to smoke.”

325
00:45:04,390 --> 00:45:11,339
I said, “Better smoke then, but you can’t
be a Sahaja Yogi, because smoking Sahaja Yogi

326
00:45:11,339 --> 00:45:16,730
is a funny caricature, you know, I can’t
think of a Sahaja Yogi smoking. How will I

327
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:18,839
look if I start smoking like that?”

328
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:20,200
“Ah, horrible.”

329
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:27,200
I said, “Then if you are My son, you cannot
smoke, it looks bad.” He gave up smoking,

330
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:31,440
can you imagine?

331
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:37,609
So, dealing with children, always make yourself
an example, yourself part and parcel of that

332
00:45:37,609 --> 00:45:44,609
event. So the children don’t feel, you know.
This is something that I have talked many

333
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:57,230
a times. Children is one thing, I tell you,
they can give up everything but not your love.

334
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:05,339
If they know you love them they will not accept
anything that will make you not love - not

335
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:17,150
love them. This is for definite, because children
are the best people who know about love.

336
00:46:20,740 --> 00:46:25,690
Of course, I don’t know, I feel that in
English language, I didn’t see many books

337
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:32,119
about children written beautiful, beautiful
things. There was one book that was published

338
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:38,380
when I was in London: The children talking
about the politicians, and they published

339
00:46:38,380 --> 00:46:44,650
I think, 5000 books and that very same day
it was finished. So, talk to children, talk

340
00:46:44,650 --> 00:46:50,750
to them. You’ll be amazed, they are full
of honey. They have such nice, nice things

341
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:57,750
with them and when they talk like that, then
you are amazed how they say things, how they

342
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:06,099
talk of Sahaj, how they are expressing their
spiritual strength.

343
00:47:06,799 --> 00:47:13,799
Now, we have many very good children and also
they are absolutely Sahaj. One boy came and

344
00:47:21,770 --> 00:47:24,220
he just prostrated himself before Me.

345
00:47:24,220 --> 00:47:27,400
So, I said, “Why you did it?”

346
00:47:27,400 --> 00:47:30,910
“No, I was getting cool vibrations, Mother
from You, so I did it.”

347
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:33,549
“Is it, you like it?”

348
00:47:33,549 --> 00:47:36,799
“Of course!”

349
00:47:36,799 --> 00:47:39,410
“More than chocolate?”

350
00:47:39,410 --> 00:47:40,809
“Of course!”

351
00:47:40,809 --> 00:47:45,210
I was surprised. “What? You eat them or
what?”

352
00:47:45,210 --> 00:47:52,210
“No need to eat, no, no, you feel so happy
inside and I feel, Mother, You are putting

353
00:47:53,359 --> 00:47:56,980
Your hand on my heart and trying to console
me.”

354
00:47:56,980 --> 00:47:59,869
Surprised. “And where is your heart?”

355
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:06,869
He said, “Here, here is my heart, I feel
it here.” Just imagine, what love and what

356
00:48:08,059 --> 00:48:13,260
understanding of Sahaja Yoga! For these little
children who are below even five years.

357
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:20,260
Now, you are all grown up children of Mine
and I want you to know all the beauties that

358
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:28,210
are within you, that you have to enjoy. First
of all, learn to laugh at yourself. That’s

359
00:48:28,210 --> 00:48:35,210
the best way to enjoy yourself, you know.
And not to spend much time on the mirror,

360
00:48:37,849 --> 00:48:43,039
in the mirror, that’s another way. You spend
too much on the mirror, then something wrong

361
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:47,720
with you. I think, personally, that it’s
a kind of a possession maybe. So, what you

362
00:48:47,720 --> 00:48:54,720
should see inside, “Are we sahaj dharmis?
Mother has established sahaj dharma, much

363
00:48:58,650 --> 00:49:04,430
more than what Krishna wanted to establish.
He wanted to establish the dharma of love

364
00:49:04,430 --> 00:49:11,430
which of course we have, but apart from that
we have so many other beautiful facets and

365
00:49:12,819 --> 00:49:19,819
such beautiful things within our personality
that we have forgotten to enjoy.”

366
00:49:20,029 --> 00:49:27,029
So, the attention should be on your own qualities,
on your own personality, and then you’ll

367
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:38,130
be amazed how your personality is giving you
joy, giving you alladha, giving you so much

368
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:45,910
of patience with others.

369
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:52,910
To Me the whole thing looks like sometimes
a joke, because nothing so serious. It’s

370
00:49:54,960 --> 00:50:01,960
not a Rama’s type that you have to be serious.
I don’t have to kill anybody. I don’t

371
00:50:02,809 --> 00:50:09,809
use any weapons in this lifetime. Without
weapons if things are solved, what can you

372
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:10,519
do?

373
00:50:10,519 --> 00:50:16,230
But you must try to see the beauty as Sahaja
Yogis. You should be sensitive to see how

374
00:50:16,230 --> 00:50:23,230
you have been helped, how you have been guided,
how you have been blessed. This is sahaj dharma.

375
00:50:25,789 --> 00:50:31,680
If you cannot know that, then you live on
a very low level. I mean, it’s not fault

376
00:50:31,680 --> 00:50:38,680
of Sahaja Yoga, but it’s your style, you
are not sensitive. Supposing somebody is not

377
00:50:40,849 --> 00:50:47,849
- does not burn his hand. So what will you
do? He has no sense, he has no sensitivity,

378
00:50:51,109 --> 00:50:58,109
he cannot feel. He can drink, he can smoke,
he can do everything and still he's existing,

379
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:04,069
all right. Must be a rakshasa, I think or
I don’t know what to say.

380
00:51:04,069 --> 00:51:11,069
So, we have to take example from other good
Sahaja Yogis and not from the bad ones and

381
00:51:13,849 --> 00:51:20,849
how do we proceed in enjoyment - which is
a ocean, just a ocean. For example, now, I

382
00:51:23,329 --> 00:51:29,880
came, everybody was trying to fan. But also
in the West another problem is they like to

383
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:35,750
live in hermetically-sealed rooms, hermetically-sealed
cars, they are very afraid of draft, I don’t

384
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:41,279
know, as if they’ll be blown away or what
will happen to them. They don’t want draft.

385
00:51:41,279 --> 00:51:48,279
I mean draft is not coming from some iceberg.
So, they don’t believe in the fresh air

386
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:55,640
at all and that’s one other reason that
people are very suffocating sometimes, you

387
00:51:56,760 --> 00:52:01,789
know, they just suffocate. They are used to
a suffocating life.

388
00:52:01,789 --> 00:52:08,789
Once I was in India, I was very hot, so somebody
was driving Me, but the person who was there

389
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:14,289
was from Western country. He said, “Don’t
open - don’t open the window.”

390
00:52:14,289 --> 00:52:15,569
I said, “Why?”

391
00:52:15,569 --> 00:52:16,849
“There’s a draft.”

392
00:52:16,849 --> 00:52:23,760
I said, “In this country, in India people
live in the open - what is a draft? What draft

393
00:52:23,760 --> 00:52:28,740
you are talking about?” You can’t open
the door, you can’t open the window, you

394
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:34,720
can’t open anything, if you open anything,
they’ll be all dead, you see – as if.

395
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:37,029
So open yourself!

396
00:52:37,029 --> 00:52:44,029
As it is about the nature, also it is in their
private lives. They don’t want to open.

397
00:52:49,390 --> 00:52:54,950
If somebody comes to their house, “Oh my
God, now we’ll have to share the wines,

398
00:52:54,950 --> 00:53:01,950
we’ll have to share the foods” They cannot
share. They cannot share. That is most uncollective.

399
00:53:10,869 --> 00:53:17,400
But in India, I must say, people have a good
sharing capacity because they are still primitive,

400
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:24,400
they are still primordial, yet not gone out
of the way to satisfy their own ego. But I

401
00:53:30,670 --> 00:53:37,670
think somehow or other in India, people like
to share. If you want to please any Indian,

402
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:50,089
you tell them, tomorrow I’ll come and have
food with you. His wife will jump. She’ll

403
00:53:50,089 --> 00:53:57,089
say, “Now what do you like, tell me, what
food do you like?” She will jump. But otherwise,

404
00:54:00,109 --> 00:54:05,670
what happens, as soon as you say he’s coming
for food, the wife will say, “No, no, I

405
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:12,670
am going to my mother.” Immediately she’ll
have a program. I just don’t understand.

406
00:54:19,029 --> 00:54:25,480
They’ll have beautiful houses, very clean,
very beautiful, everything, but if somebody

407
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:32,480
comes to their house, they get a shock as
if electricity has entered. So, for whom is

408
00:54:34,769 --> 00:54:36,640
all this?

409
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:43,640
To show off, they will borrow money from the
banks. Even Indians in America they do. They

410
00:54:44,269 --> 00:54:51,269
want to have three Mercedes, four houses - for
what? Borrowing money with borrowing money

411
00:54:53,490 --> 00:55:00,490
they live. Sahaja Yogis have not to borrow
any money. There’s no need, you can do away

412
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:09,450
with things. Why to have so many cars? Nowadays,
people don’t even walk at all. We used to

413
00:55:11,799 --> 00:55:18,799
go to our school, My father had a car in India
- nothing doing. We had to walk. We used to

414
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:26,230
climb one mountain. It was about five miles,
the school - every morning. Then in the night,

415
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:33,230
in the evening, the car used to come, and
I would walk with My bare feet, because so

416
00:55:35,130 --> 00:55:42,130
much vibrations and on the chappals, I thought
were cutting my vibrations, so I used to have

417
00:55:42,519 --> 00:55:49,140
chappals in My hand and walk. One day we had
a new driver, My father sent him. He said,

418
00:55:49,140 --> 00:55:54,589
“How will I know who is the daughter.”
He said, “Any girl with the chappals in

419
00:55:54,589 --> 00:55:58,890
Her hand is the one whom you have to bring.”

420
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:05,890
So, it is to enjoy your nobility, to enjoy
your generosity. It’s very important. And

421
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:15,130
not to side with anyone. You are not identified
with anyone.

422
00:56:15,130 --> 00:56:21,490
It’s much better now, I think, because since
you have taken to sahaj dharma, I’ve seen

423
00:56:21,490 --> 00:56:25,829
English will tell you what’s wrong with
English. Swiss will tell you what’s wrong

424
00:56:25,829 --> 00:56:30,480
with Swiss. Indians will tell you what’s
wrong with Indians. Actually, I learned from

425
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:35,039
them. I don’t know these things are there.
Russians will tell you what’s wrong with

426
00:56:35,039 --> 00:56:42,039
Russians. They immediately start seeing, “What’s
wrong with us? Where do we lack in this?”

427
00:56:45,109 --> 00:56:52,109
Because the collectivity of being in one country,
say as an Indian, we see now, what’s happening

428
00:56:55,299 --> 00:57:02,069
in India, all corrupt, horrible, this, that.
So, I said, “All right, if you don’t like

429
00:57:02,069 --> 00:57:06,759
India, why don’t you go somewhere else?”
No, no, no, that - we will stay here, but

430
00:57:06,759 --> 00:57:13,009
this is a very corrupt government they are,
it’s very bad, this, that. Anywhere you

431
00:57:13,009 --> 00:57:20,009
go, you will find immediately they see - because
you don’t know they are now chosen to change

432
00:57:23,029 --> 00:57:24,849
their country.

433
00:57:24,849 --> 00:57:31,849
I’ve taken up many questions now, of India
and I’m going to start working on that level.

434
00:57:34,440 --> 00:57:41,440
We've already started, in a way, for the destitute
women, then for other type of poverty and

435
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:49,180
all that. Just by saying, remove poverty,
poverty cannot be lost. You have to have feeling

436
00:57:49,180 --> 00:57:56,180
for the poor, then only - but you get with
more that feeling because you are an Indian.

437
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:03,349
You are an Indian, so what? Your own brothers,
sisters starving. You get that very deep feeling

438
00:58:05,019 --> 00:58:09,410
within you if you are a sahaj dharmi.

439
00:58:09,410 --> 00:58:15,390
So, this is the new dharma we have established
now in this world. A new race, with a new

440
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:22,390
dharma, which is much above - even Shri Krishna’s
vision is coming true. He describes in the

441
00:58:24,579 --> 00:58:30,849
beginning. I think, He was not a good salesman,
because He describes the best first. You see

442
00:58:30,849 --> 00:58:37,849
the salesman first will start from two rupees,
then go onward to two thousand. But He first

443
00:58:38,589 --> 00:58:45,319
told us that you have to become Sthita Pragya,
means Sahaja Yogi - and then Shri Krishna

444
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:52,049
was asked a question by Arjuna, “What is
a Sthita Pragya?” Then He describes a Sahaja

445
00:58:52,049 --> 00:58:59,049
Yogi, that He describes before, first chapter,
second chapter is that, now. Then the questions

446
00:59:00,220 --> 00:59:03,819
start. You know, Arjuna was a great questioner,
I think.

447
00:59:03,819 --> 00:59:09,069
So, he starts asking questions, “Then what
about this and what about that and what about

448
00:59:09,069 --> 00:59:09,339
that?”

449
00:59:09,339 --> 00:59:16,339
So He goes on explaining to him that “You
see, this is all just a maya, this is all

450
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:24,220
an illusion you have. Get out of this illusion.
If once you get out of this illusion,” because

451
00:59:24,819 --> 00:59:31,339
Arjuna said, “They are my relations, they
are my teachers. How can I kill them?”

452
00:59:31,339 --> 00:59:36,569
So, Krishna says, “Nobody is killed.”
He said, “Nobody is killed, but they are

453
00:59:36,569 --> 00:59:42,940
being killed because they are not following
the satya dharma, so it’s all right. What

454
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:47,099
is your brother, what is your sister? They
are not following the satya dharma, so you

455
00:59:47,099 --> 00:59:53,329
have nothing to do with them. If you can correct
them and help them, it’s all right, otherwise

456
00:59:53,329 --> 00:59:54,089
forget them.”

457
00:59:54,089 --> 01:00:01,089
First, deal with people who are straight.
Like we should say that we must deal with

458
01:00:01,259 --> 01:00:08,259
people who are simple, innocent and then you
can take to difficult people when you are

459
01:00:08,529 --> 01:00:12,680
that good. Otherwise you’ll come here saying,
“Mother, I have caught this, I have caught

460
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:19,680
that.” So, in sahaj dharma, you being the
spirit, you also know about others, very well

461
01:00:20,500 --> 01:00:25,789
and you can make it out, who is who, what
chakras they are catching.

462
01:00:25,789 --> 01:00:32,789
But the trouble in America, I found that Sahaja
Yogis used to, just could go and tell somebody,

463
01:00:34,410 --> 01:00:40,549
“You are catching on this chakra.” Now,
he has come for the first time and you tell

464
01:00:40,549 --> 01:00:42,079
him, “You, you are very egoistical.”

465
01:00:42,079 --> 01:00:44,240
He says, “How do you know?”

466
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,869
“Your Agnya is catching.” Maybe, his own
Agnya might be catching.

467
01:00:47,869 --> 01:00:54,869
Is this the way to receive a new person? Is
this the way to talk to a new person? See,

468
01:00:55,140 --> 01:01:00,950
on the contrary, you should say, “Come,
sit down, very nice, you are very great,”

469
01:01:00,950 --> 01:01:07,390
see? Because they are still ignorant, so they
like some sort of buttering, as you call it,

470
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:14,390
you see, we call it chaplusi. Then, gradually,
because you are doing this just to make him

471
01:01:16,069 --> 01:01:21,569
a Sahaja Yogi, because you love him. Basically
that is the reason. But as soon as somebody

472
01:01:21,569 --> 01:01:26,789
comes in, if you tell him, “This is wrong
with you, that’s wrong with you.” This

473
01:01:26,789 --> 01:01:33,789
is not a pope’s business where you go on
telling people what’s wrong with them, go

474
01:01:33,970 --> 01:01:40,970
and confess to all these silly people. It’s
not that. What we have to show that you have

475
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:48,690
fallen in love with that person; you are nice
to that person because you like that person.

476
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:54,990
Then gradually you pull him up. But as soon
as he comes you give him one shock, so finished.

477
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:57,839
How can you have good relations?

478
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,829
Americans have to learn this. I don’t know
why Americans think they are very superior

479
01:02:01,829 --> 01:02:08,829
people. I tell you for wisdom, I would not
say they are so good. It’s completely lacking

480
01:02:09,609 --> 01:02:16,609
– wisdom in them. And they misunderstand
people very fast. Start judging others, is

481
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:25,480
not the way you can have sahaj dharma. Sahaj
dharma is: you are your own. You are in your

482
01:02:25,980 --> 01:02:32,190
own, you are in your own realm and in your
happiness and joy. Where is the time to criticize

483
01:02:32,190 --> 01:02:33,279
others?

484
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:40,279
So the best thing is to show your maximum
love to everyone. In that love you should

485
01:02:40,910 --> 01:02:47,910
not show your pity, but love which is, again,
alladhadayini. This is the message of Shri

486
01:02:49,029 --> 01:02:53,569
Krishna, but I don’t know how many understood
it. Now, what you find those who are following

487
01:02:53,569 --> 01:03:00,569
Shri Krishna like Hare Rama people, they are
really beggars on the street. He is Kubera,

488
01:03:02,190 --> 01:03:08,599
and his disciples are all beggars, can you
imagine? Does it add to His glory as a Kubera?

489
01:03:08,599 --> 01:03:15,599
So, Sahaja Yogis are not like that. Should
be generous, should not bother too much about

490
01:03:18,470 --> 01:03:25,470
yourself. Should not all the time think about
yourself, but think of the collectivity, how

491
01:03:26,950 --> 01:03:33,950
you behave. Collectivity is not to bring - force
people to come to Sahaja Yoga. Once they come

492
01:03:38,420 --> 01:03:43,700
to Sahaja Yoga they will know the joy of life
and you don’t have to tell them anything.

493
01:03:43,700 --> 01:03:50,700
Nothing has to be told, just silently it will
work and they will feel your love.

494
01:03:51,380 --> 01:03:58,380
You see, love is something so great. It not
only helps others but it also helps you. It’s

495
01:04:01,230 --> 01:04:07,430
so joyous to give realizations to others.
But if you start telling, “Your this chakra

496
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:11,319
is catching”, why you are giving realization?
If you don’t know how to give realization,

497
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:18,319
better not do it. So, to criticize is not
the way we can enjoy love. Ah, of course you

498
01:04:22,369 --> 01:04:29,049
can pull legs of each other sometimes, just
for fun’s sake, but not to harm, not to

499
01:04:29,049 --> 01:04:36,049
torture, not to make that person fall. You
are all sahaj dharmis, you have accepted sahaj

500
01:04:38,249 --> 01:04:45,249
dharma and in sahaj dharma we have to have
pure love of the heart, not hypocrisy - and

501
01:04:52,619 --> 01:04:53,720
sensible life.

502
01:04:53,720 --> 01:05:00,720
Now, this pope is against abortion. I’m
not. If a woman is suffering, let her have

503
01:05:02,059 --> 01:05:09,059
abortion. The one who is living is more important
than who are not living. If somebody wants

504
01:05:09,660 --> 01:05:16,660
to have abortion, that child can be born again.
According to us, nobody dies permanently.

505
01:05:18,089 --> 01:05:22,890
Whatever it may be.

506
01:05:22,890 --> 01:05:29,890
So, this is one way they use it for propagation
of human beings. Like they say the Muslim

507
01:05:33,499 --> 01:05:38,740
women are like a factory. They go on producing
more children, more children, more children.

508
01:05:38,740 --> 01:05:45,740
So there are more voters. So the pope knows
that. That’s why he says, abortion, no.

509
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:53,890
Christians should not abort, because then
there will be less Christians to compete with

510
01:05:55,369 --> 01:05:57,589
the Muslims.

511
01:05:57,589 --> 01:06:02,769
But in Sahaja Yoga, we don’t have such funny,
radical, nonsensical things. We have divorce,

512
01:06:02,769 --> 01:06:09,769
and we have also abortion, which is important
to understand that these are all taboos which

513
01:06:14,769 --> 01:06:21,769
are there. But not for people who have to
get out of the troubles - you have to have

514
01:06:24,999 --> 01:06:31,999
it. And that’s how it works. But to be very
frank, we don’t have to do abortions, it

515
01:06:32,849 --> 01:06:39,849
is achieved by Paramchaitanya. Paramchaitanya
does for Me. I don’t have to. I don’t

516
01:06:42,309 --> 01:06:49,069
have to do anything. It’s Paramchaitanya.
It’s nice, because it knows what is to be

517
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:55,460
done, how to achieve it. And sometimes you
are in trouble, then know that you are not

518
01:06:55,460 --> 01:07:00,609
leaving things into the hands of the Paramchaitanya.
If you leave into the hands of Paramchaitanya

519
01:07:00,609 --> 01:07:06,450
things will work out very well.

520
01:07:06,450 --> 01:07:12,710
So, to understand Sahaja Yoga, first and foremost
thing is, how much you are enjoying yourself.

521
01:07:12,710 --> 01:07:19,710
How much enjoyment you are giving to others?
For that you have music, you have this, that.

522
01:07:21,039 --> 01:07:28,039
I was saying that today I won’t speak much,
but, somehow, with Shri Krishna 
you can’t keep quiet. He played murli, basuri,

523
01:07:37,049 --> 01:07:44,049
flute. Look at Him. I talked to Him, but He
just played murli. He didn’t talk so much,

524
01:07:46,910 --> 01:07:53,559
except for the Gita, you won’t find Him
talking. And those who read also Gita are

525
01:07:53,559 --> 01:07:58,940
horrible people, I tell you, I have met - those
who read Gita. They don’t understand what

526
01:07:58,940 --> 01:08:03,680
is Shri Krishna’s dharma is. If they don’t
understand Shri Krishna, how will they understand

527
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:10,680
Sahaja Yoga? So, for all of you is to practice
on love, on forgiveness, on appreciating others,

528
01:08:20,859 --> 01:08:24,359
on giving joy to others.

529
01:08:24,359 --> 01:08:30,529
Some of the Sahaja Yogis have been very kind
to Me also. Once I went to the shop to buy

530
01:08:30,529 --> 01:08:37,529
a sari for Myself and the sari was very expensive
for My purpose. So, I didn’t buy. Said,

531
01:08:39,730 --> 01:08:46,730
“Let it be. This color suits Me, all right,
but doesn’t matter.” I didn’t have so

532
01:08:46,969 --> 01:08:53,969
much money to buy. So, that Sahaja Yogi bought
that sari and on My birthday gave Me - and

533
01:08:54,290 --> 01:08:56,210
really, I could not see it, because My eyes
were filled with tears. Just a small thing

534
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:56,460
like that. Normally I don’t expect you to
do anything for Me, no. But small, small things

535
01:08:56,210 --> 01:08:57,650
make you so happy. But even if you do this
to somebody, may not understand, may not realize,

536
01:08:57,650 --> 01:09:03,690
may not feel it. But if you are a Sahaja Yogi,
you will.

537
01:09:03,690 --> 01:09:03,940
So thank you very much for all this that I
have said to you, try to enjoy yourself and

538
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
make others enjoy you.

539
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
May God bless you!

540
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
Lecture after some music:

541
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
You can see I’ve become black today because
of Shri Krishna. It’s very interesting how

542
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
everything in this world moves according to
the desire of the Paramchaitanya. It’s very

543
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
surprising. I wanted them to make a film about
fundamentalism. It’s done very well. And

544
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
we might be able to show it in India – maybe,
because they have already asked Me to make

545
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:04,060
some episodes of My life, which they would
like to show, one after another. Somehow in

546
01:09:03,810 --> 01:09:05,440
India in the television we have many Sahaja
Yogis, I didn’t know. Even the director,

547
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:05,690
deputy director, they were all Sahaja Yogis.
And once they came to see Me in Delhi in our

548
01:09:05,440 --> 01:09:05,730
ashram and said to Me - somebody said, “Mother,
You don’t like media, but what about television?”

549
01:09:05,730 --> 01:09:06,119
I said, “Don’t talk to Me about television.
They are horrible people there, ruining our

550
01:09:06,119 --> 01:09:07,049
lives,” and I gave a very big lecture, you
know, for about five minutes. So, two persons

551
01:09:07,049 --> 01:09:08,710
came before Me, holding their ears, they said,
“Mother, we’re sorry, but we belong to

552
01:09:08,710 --> 01:09:08,960
the television.”

553
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:09,000
“I see, I’m sorry, if I’ve said something.”

554
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:09,279
Then they said, “I’m the director and
he’s the deputy director of the All-India

555
01:09:09,279 --> 01:09:09,529
Institute of Television.” Can you imagine?

556
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:09,670
“Oh, My God,” I said, “I never knew
you were here and I’m sorry for what I’ve

557
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:09,670
said.”

558
01:09:09,420 --> 01:09:11,069
So they wanted to have My – I think I had
three interviews with them. They said, “Mother,

559
01:09:11,069 --> 01:09:12,150
we’ll not ask You a question.” All right.
“But then You come and sit wherever You

560
01:09:12,150 --> 01:09:12,600
want to sit and we’ll organize everything
and we want to show to the people what is

561
01:09:12,600 --> 01:09:12,850
reality.”

562
01:09:12,609 --> 01:09:12,859
I was so surprised, you know, they did it,
no doubt. But last time when they wanted to

563
01:09:12,790 --> 01:09:14,029
do it I was not in Delhi and I couldn’t
do it. So I said, “Next time I’ll try

564
01:09:14,029 --> 01:09:14,279
to do something.”

565
01:09:14,109 --> 01:09:15,319
They said, “Why not You give some episodes
to us?” I think the films I’ve seen which

566
01:09:15,319 --> 01:09:16,600
these – the Americans, the great, have made
– all of them I would like to give them.

567
01:09:16,600 --> 01:09:17,790
But the second part of Christians also must
be shown, to give a balance. And also of the

568
01:09:17,790 --> 01:09:21,810
stupid Hindu – you call them – false gurus.
So like that we can have a combination of

569
01:09:21,810 --> 01:09:22,060
three films. In that you can show about Hare
Ramas, how they are begging, and how other

570
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,270
people are beggars - like Jehovah’s’ Witness.
But apart from that, Christianity works out

571
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,270
everything secretly, you see. So you have
to expose some things also there. Because

572
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:22,739
it is, on top it’s very nice, very good
to talk to and all that, but inside they are

573
01:09:22,739 --> 01:09:23,400
doing all kinds of things, and making people
take to, what you can say, something very

574
01:09:23,400 --> 01:09:24,060
sinister. Something very wrong. Now they – unless
and until you expose all these three it won’t

575
01:09:24,060 --> 01:09:24,589
have a balance, I think, and then we can talk
about Sahaja Yoga as well.

576
01:09:24,589 --> 01:09:26,100
I’m very happy the way the film was made,
I’m very, very happy. That the Muslims are,

577
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:26,350
poor things, from childhood are taught to
hate everyone. At least in Christianity they

578
01:09:26,219 --> 01:09:26,469
talk of love. Talk, talk – again I say.
Because they have had so many wars and so

579
01:09:26,359 --> 01:09:26,609
many nonsensical things. Now we can put forward
in these films, say for Christians we can

580
01:09:26,489 --> 01:09:26,739
put forward Gnostics. We can put forward in
the Muslim thing how the real person was Ali,

581
01:09:26,630 --> 01:09:26,880
how He was murdered, His wife, his children
were murdered and what’s going on now. It’s

582
01:09:26,770 --> 01:09:30,690
quite a bold theme which you have to put in.
And by doing all these things nobody gets

583
01:09:30,690 --> 01:09:30,940
anything – peace or joy, which is promised
by religion. So, these religions have no meaning.

584
01:09:30,750 --> 01:09:31,000
The religion within is very different, which
is to be awakened. And once it is awakened

585
01:09:30,810 --> 01:09:31,060
we all become one. We have to come to that
point. So, I think this film as it is - is

586
01:09:30,889 --> 01:09:31,139
all right, it could be little bit shortened
here and there, plus you must have another

587
01:09:30,949 --> 01:09:31,199
film and another film. Then these three films,
if they are ready, I’m sure, will be able

588
01:09:31,020 --> 01:09:31,270
to show the nonsense that is going on.

589
01:09:31,049 --> 01:09:31,299
The Muslims are against Christians more, also
against Jews. But Christians they are against,

590
01:09:31,109 --> 01:09:31,359
because they think this Christian religion
gives complete freedom to do what you like,

591
01:09:31,159 --> 01:09:31,409
their women go nude, they wear very scanty
dresses, and the women are like prostitutes

592
01:09:31,219 --> 01:09:31,469
and men are, I don’t know, they run after
women and men run after. So that’s the only

593
01:09:31,290 --> 01:09:31,540
job they’ve got. They haven’t got anything
higher, anything great. So they are against

594
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:31,589
– they think that they must put some taboos.

595
01:09:31,469 --> 01:09:33,040
But I like the way you showed about these
people from Colombia – aboriginal. I’m

596
01:09:33,040 --> 01:09:33,290
going to talk about them in Ganesha Puja.
They are worth lots of things more than you

597
01:09:33,049 --> 01:09:33,299
know. So we have to see to this, that what
is wrong in all these things? In Sahaja Yoga

598
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:33,310
we attend to our primordial taboos. They’re
primordial. These taboos are primordial. And

599
01:09:33,060 --> 01:09:33,310
if you cross them and if you leave your maryadas,
then – whether you are a Muslim or a Hindu,

600
01:09:33,069 --> 01:09:33,319
you cannot be saved, you cannot get your realization.
So in Sahaja Yoga the built-in dharma within

601
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:33,330
us is awakened and we take to primordial taboos
which are meant for a human being. If a human

602
01:09:33,089 --> 01:09:33,339
being does not observe these taboos, then
what happens: whatever is happening in America

603
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:33,350
or Iran or any other country. So what are
the primordial taboos and all that I am going

604
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:33,359
to discuss in Ganesha Puja. And once that
is awakened within us I don’t tell you,

605
01:09:33,109 --> 01:09:33,359
“Don’t do this and don’t do that,”
there’s no need, because it’s all awakened

606
01:09:33,119 --> 01:09:33,369
within you and you just don’t do it. So
that is has to be brought in this way.

607
01:09:33,130 --> 01:09:33,380
But the filming was very good, acting was
excellent, I must say, but we can write another

608
01:09:33,139 --> 01:09:33,389
story without Me, if you possible. Of course
this will be all right for Indians, they will

609
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:33,400
understand. But if you show this to any Muslim
country, they’ll be shocked. For that I

610
01:09:33,150 --> 01:09:33,400
would say that this gentleman who was this
Rouhani – Ayatollah Rouhani – he sent

611
01:09:33,159 --> 01:09:33,409
a very nice letter, say that “In the Koran
it is written that to follow a religion you

612
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:33,420
read about it. The main thing is you have
to know yourself. If you do not know yourself,

613
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:33,429
you can never know God.” It’s written,
clearly. So he said, “This great work is

614
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,440
done by Shri Mataji, is the work of Islam
that She is doing.” It’s a big, sort of,

615
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:33,440
what you can call a big certificate because
he is head of all the Shias of Europe.

616
01:09:33,199 --> 01:09:33,449
So that is how, if we want to make people
happy we cannot discipline them, we cannot

617
01:09:33,210 --> 01:09:33,460
tell them, “Don’t do this, don’t do
that.” Only thing you better awaken them.

618
01:09:33,219 --> 01:09:33,469
As soon as there is light within you, you
see for yourself what’s wrong. Of course,

619
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:33,480
some people do get it much faster, I must
say, much deeper. But some have ego, some

620
01:09:33,230 --> 01:09:33,480
have conditionings. So still they go back
to it and again come back to it, you see it’s

621
01:09:33,239 --> 01:09:33,489
like that. But mostly Sahaja Yogis, once they
get to Sahaja Yoga, they go deep into it – mostly.

622
01:09:33,250 --> 01:09:33,500
And I must say that we are now sending lots
of Russians to America, they will solve the

623
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:33,509
problem.

624
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:33,509
May God bless you!

625
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:33,509
[Hindi ?]

626
01:09:33,259 --> 01:09:33,509
It’s not so easy, let it be. Another very
great miracle I must say, I was to go to Russia,

627
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:33,520
but felt sick and I had to take rest, couldn’t
go to Russia. And the Russians had prepared

628
01:09:33,279 --> 01:09:33,529
for the marriages, you see. So then they thought
we could have marriages in Cabella. I said,

629
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:33,540
”That’s absurd, because we can have an
English marriage, but not possible to have

630
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:33,549
an Indian marriage in Cabella. Will be very
difficult. But a thing happened, you see,

631
01:09:33,299 --> 01:09:33,549
to convince Me. I said, “The biggest problem
will be about saris for the brides.” Because

632
01:09:33,310 --> 01:09:33,560
nobody can select. I have to go and select,
and how will it happen? And suddenly somebody

633
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:33,569
told Me, “Mother, we have some very nice
saris.”

634
01:09:33,319 --> 01:09:33,569
“Very nice saris? Bring them along.” I
was amazed - there were seventy-two saris,

635
01:09:33,330 --> 01:09:33,580
very beautiful with very good zuri work, just
for the bride, in red color. Can you imagine?

636
01:09:33,339 --> 01:09:33,589
I said, “This is Shri Krishna, Who has sent
the saris, as He had supplied it at the time

637
01:09:33,350 --> 01:09:33,600
when Draupadi asked for saris, you see. After
that I decided, “All right, what may come,

638
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:33,609
we must have the weddings.” So there might
be some, some maybe, I don’t know what will

639
01:09:33,359 --> 01:09:33,609
be, some handicaps, doesn’t matter, but
it’s a very big venture, I think, to marry

640
01:09:33,369 --> 01:09:33,619
you people here with American arrangements
and in Indian style in Italy.

641
01:09:33,380 --> 01:09:33,630
So all of you have to be very happy about
it and join in every way, and actually it

642
01:09:33,389 --> 01:09:33,639
has worked out so well that I am Myself surprised.
So, this Paramchaitanya is working, but this

643
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:33,650
time specially, supplying sari is the job
of Shri Krishna, you know, and He’s done

644
01:09:33,400 --> 01:09:33,650
His job very well. So I wish you all great
luck for enjoying these marriages. Now the

645
01:09:33,409 --> 01:09:33,659
time is little too much, but because of short
time we have something to do now is to announce

646
01:09:33,420 --> 01:09:33,670
the marriage we have thought was the best
for the people. Imagine, they said at the

647
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:33,679
most seventy or eighty marriages, now they
are one hundred. Hundred and eight!

648
01:09:33,429 --> 01:09:33,679
Now so, people who are remarrying, we have
arranged something else for them, but who

649
01:09:33,440 --> 01:09:33,690
are marrying for the first time. So if you
don’t mind I’ll ask somebody to read the

650
01:09:33,449 --> 01:09:33,699
names of the couples now, because we have
no time, you see. It’s such a fast running

651
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:33,710
train, you know.

652
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:33,710
So Yogi, the great, is going to do that.
