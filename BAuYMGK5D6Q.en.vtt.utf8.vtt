00:22.079 --> 00:30.460
but how do we become the Guru that is

00:28.029 --> 00:33.940
very important for sahaja Yogi's to

00:30.460 --> 00:37.000
understand many have felt that they are

00:33.940 --> 00:40.360
gurus they have tried to behave in a

00:37.000 --> 00:46.269
funny manner and have lost their boo

00:40.360 --> 00:49.390
position first and foremost thing for

00:46.269 --> 00:54.899
sahaja Yogi's it is important that they

00:49.390 --> 01:03.219
must have introspection they was foster

00:54.899 --> 01:06.520
if a person runs about changing because

01:03.219 --> 01:10.200
a fashion has come because people have

01:06.520 --> 01:18.869
suppressed them or have asked them just

01:10.200 --> 01:24.659
to please people of cheap values if a

01:18.869 --> 01:29.290
person changes then he cannot be a guru

01:24.659 --> 01:34.860
he has to station its himself properly

01:29.290 --> 01:39.070
on the values of sahaja yoga without

01:34.860 --> 01:42.390
introspection you will not know you will

01:39.070 --> 01:47.710
never remember what you have done wrong

01:42.390 --> 01:52.750
nor will you think of what you have to

01:47.710 --> 01:57.700
do right but that is only possible if

01:52.750 --> 02:06.780
you go on improving yourself when you

01:57.700 --> 02:11.380
are climbing on it into the new part of

02:06.780 --> 02:17.620
righteousness of goodness of compassion

02:11.380 --> 02:22.260
and love you should see yourself watch

02:17.620 --> 02:24.630
yourself what are you doing

02:22.260 --> 02:30.520
where are you going

02:24.630 --> 02:35.200
how far you are stupid you should not

02:30.520 --> 02:44.740
cheat your hair this is the first step

02:35.200 --> 02:52.260
is of introspection now what helps for

02:44.740 --> 02:52.260
this introspection is your sense of love

02:52.770 --> 03:05.830
can you love a person who is distressful

03:00.450 --> 03:11.920
one who is aggressive one who is

03:05.830 --> 03:18.459
hot-tempered one who cheats you can you

03:11.920 --> 03:21.850
love such a person you can then how can

03:18.459 --> 03:25.750
you love yourself when you have these

03:21.850 --> 03:30.570
qualities when you do this to yourself

03:25.750 --> 03:35.590
so the first thing is the pure love for

03:30.570 --> 03:41.790
yourself if you love yourself you don't

03:35.590 --> 03:46.450
want anything because you enjoy yourself

03:41.790 --> 03:49.930
to enjoy yourself is the greatest

03:46.450 --> 03:54.480
enjoyment so this is the beginning of

03:49.930 --> 03:59.200
your self-realization when you realize

03:54.480 --> 04:03.220
how important is yourself you don't have

03:59.200 --> 04:07.000
wrong ideas about it you don't justify

04:03.220 --> 04:14.280
all the wrong thing you do because you

04:07.000 --> 04:19.919
understand that is a blemish on yourself

04:14.280 --> 04:24.040
fix yourself in the most honest manner

04:19.919 --> 04:29.470
and you'll be amazed to see how nice it

04:24.040 --> 04:34.890
is just to see the pure self shining

04:29.470 --> 04:37.260
within you when that cell starts shining

04:34.890 --> 04:43.040
you start seeing many

04:37.260 --> 04:49.710
things which you have not seen so and

04:43.040 --> 04:55.740
one of them you see is that love is not

04:49.710 --> 05:02.940
only for yourself but for everyone it's

04:55.740 --> 05:06.950
a pure love for everyone else it's not

05:02.940 --> 05:12.240
only for yourself it's very surprising

05:06.950 --> 05:20.330
when you really love yourself then your

05:12.240 --> 05:20.330
love is for yourself and you start

05:21.290 --> 05:32.580
spreading that love in such a manner

05:25.020 --> 05:37.550
that you dutifully love others you don't

05:32.580 --> 05:45.260
love for money you don't love for some

05:37.550 --> 05:52.140
advantage for some power or for some

05:45.260 --> 05:54.530
gain but you love for love because pure

05:52.140 --> 05:58.740
love is so joy-giving

05:54.530 --> 06:08.630
so from now we go to other point which

05:58.740 --> 06:11.400
is purity and the purity is a subject

06:08.630 --> 06:15.870
which has been talked about by many

06:11.400 --> 06:23.010
people that you should be pure you

06:15.870 --> 06:27.900
should behave absolutely open and people

06:23.010 --> 06:32.460
should know everything about you I don't

06:27.900 --> 06:37.650
think that is purity purity is that

06:32.460 --> 06:42.890
which purifies others if you are a pure

06:37.650 --> 06:46.030
person then others should be purified

06:42.890 --> 06:48.580
purity is very pardon

06:46.030 --> 06:52.120
it may not act on one or two questions

06:48.580 --> 06:57.390
don't matter there could be some very

06:52.120 --> 07:02.920
very nasty horrible fellows Bernard but

06:57.390 --> 07:08.100
it would have an effect or very many

07:02.920 --> 07:17.310
sensitive persons who want to become

07:08.100 --> 07:21.430
sahaja Yogi's you have to just test it

07:17.310 --> 07:25.810
how people likes you and how they are

07:21.430 --> 07:31.030
impressed by the paramchaitanya is all

07:25.810 --> 07:37.240
pervading power of divine love flows

07:31.030 --> 07:42.880
through you because of you if you are

07:37.240 --> 07:48.790
impure then it will stop at different

07:42.880 --> 07:53.800
chakras it won't work so purity of

07:48.790 --> 07:58.110
temperament purity of love what does

07:53.800 --> 08:06.730
that mean that you love somebody because

07:58.110 --> 08:09.840
that person has got spirituality you

08:06.730 --> 08:17.680
love that person because there is purity

08:09.840 --> 08:26.010
so the character of a yogi is to worship

08:17.680 --> 08:26.010
the purity of your own and the purity of

08:27.690 --> 08:34.630
it is true that we have to face

08:30.520 --> 08:40.060
ourselves every day it's true we have to

08:34.630 --> 08:41.860
correct ourself every day it's true but

08:40.060 --> 08:45.760
we have to separate ourselves from

08:41.860 --> 08:49.990
ourselves to see how far we have done

08:45.760 --> 08:56.240
how far we have gone what are we doing

08:49.990 --> 08:59.560
what have we done so you

08:56.240 --> 09:05.480
call yourselves as gurus if you want I

08:59.560 --> 09:10.730
did not say that you are a guru but you

09:05.480 --> 09:15.649
have to first of all makes yourself your

09:10.730 --> 09:25.880
device must look after yourself first

09:15.649 --> 09:31.420
you have to see for yourself have I got

09:25.880 --> 09:35.660
the qualities am I the one who can

09:31.420 --> 09:38.570
really do all this all this

09:35.660 --> 09:44.740
introspection within you should be with

09:38.570 --> 09:44.740
a very clean heart and understanding

09:45.700 --> 09:54.860
because you are not incarnations which

09:49.670 --> 09:57.770
are born accessible but you are human

09:54.860 --> 10:02.870
beings and you are rising to the level

09:57.770 --> 10:07.550
of those incarnations so you have to

10:02.870 --> 10:11.899
cleanse you have to watch yourself see

10:07.550 --> 10:16.160
for yourself and then understand if you

10:11.899 --> 10:21.980
are a sahaja yogi have you got the

10:16.160 --> 10:25.490
beauty of purity and try to balance

10:21.980 --> 10:28.850
yourself try to watch yourself and guide

10:25.490 --> 10:36.709
yourself and tell yourself become your

10:28.850 --> 10:41.440
own gurus judge yourself how far you are

10:36.709 --> 10:44.390
in the center how far you are growing

10:41.440 --> 10:47.149
how much growth have you achieved

10:44.390 --> 10:51.760
are you still attached to small things

10:47.149 --> 10:55.190
here and there this is to be realized

10:51.760 --> 11:00.250
not to be put in the mind but to be

10:55.190 --> 11:06.020
realized in the heart in the realm of

11:00.250 --> 11:07.750
your heart you have to realize it you

11:06.020 --> 11:15.150

11:07.750 --> 11:15.150
