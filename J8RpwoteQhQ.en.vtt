02:09:36.472 --> 02:09:46.857
It has been such a great treat for us,
not only entertainment,

02:09:48.447 --> 02:09:57.106
but the way for our future – how to move
and what to do.

02:09:57.307 --> 02:10:06.388
It’s very surprising that this Swiss bank
business

02:10:06.589 --> 02:10:13.123
has been attracting My attention
all the time.

02:10:13.744 --> 02:10:20.084
I don’t know much, how they can digest
everything so well.

02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:29.871
In these modern times, when people are
talking of democracy,

02:10:30.072 --> 02:10:33.502
talking of very big ideal things and
all that,

02:10:33.703 --> 02:10:43.090
at the same time how can such a illegal
system exist openly?

02:10:44.070 --> 02:10:48.410
And for that I have a plan.

02:10:48.611 --> 02:10:55.413
As Arneau has said I have to expose, I have
a plan to do something about it.

02:10:55.614 --> 02:11:01.563
As far as the materialism is concerned,
it’s working out.

02:11:01.764 --> 02:11:08.570
All these countries who were supposed to
be very advanced, developed are suffering;

02:11:08.771 --> 02:11:13.527
first from recession – and a terrible
recession.

02:11:13.728 --> 02:11:17.527
That recession is going to give them
a lesson

02:11:17.750 --> 02:11:25.916
about overproduction of nonsensical goods.

02:11:26.203 --> 02:11:34.013
Materialism comes because people have
gone mad with their greed.

02:11:34.655 --> 02:11:43.552
I was searching a house in England – went
round to see houses, and I was surprised

02:11:43.753 --> 02:11:49.144
that all kinds of plastic things and mixed
things and all that,

02:11:49.345 --> 02:11:53.288
were piled up in mountains in every house,
mountains!

02:11:53.489 --> 02:12:01.443
And you pass through a door you will find
two legs of a pant falling on you.

02:12:01.644 --> 02:12:05.258
But not only in England, same in Paris:

02:12:05.459 --> 02:12:10.470
I’ve seen people accumulating so much
of nonsense

02:12:10.671 --> 02:12:15.047
that they don’t know where to put it and
what to do.

02:12:15.730 --> 02:12:19.876
This madness is on and on and on.

02:12:20.077 --> 02:12:26.557
Now, I have found out a solution for Sahaja
Yogis, what they should do.

02:12:26.758 --> 02:12:31.413
They should try to encourage handicrafts.

02:12:32.276 --> 02:12:36.951
Every country I went to, I bought
handicrafts,

02:12:37.152 --> 02:12:44.974
whether it was Czechoslovakia or England
or anywhere.

02:12:45.175 --> 02:12:51.547
I cannot understand – how can you go
and buy this rubbish of plastic,

02:12:51.748 --> 02:12:54.248
of these useless things?

02:12:54.424 --> 02:12:57.850
And these handicrafts, when I bought,
I was surprised –

02:12:58.051 --> 02:13:05.115
I must tell you about Czechoslovakia that
there were small, small, very small shops

02:13:05.316 --> 02:13:09.525
and they all came, one by one, “Mother,
buy something from us also,

02:13:09.725 --> 02:13:14.666
Mother buy something from us”. You know,
I was surprised, such beautiful things.

02:13:14.867 --> 02:13:22.334
They said, “We cannot sell them.” But all
nonsensical things people are buying.

02:13:22.535 --> 02:13:25.143
So for Sahaja Yogis, they must take a vow

02:13:25.344 --> 02:13:29.060
that “we’ll only take things which are
handmade”.

02:13:29.261 --> 02:13:37.234
You need not have many things, you can
have few, but something handmade.

02:13:37.435 --> 02:13:43.822
Now, supposing you get a dress, there
should be some handmade embroidery

02:13:44.023 --> 02:13:50.235
or something put it on that, so some labor
is put in into that.

02:13:52.310 --> 02:14:00.801
It is very difficult to see how people
go in for things

02:14:00.980 --> 02:14:08.943
which are very cheap and extremely
troublesome.

02:14:09.144 --> 02:14:12.384
I must tell you one thing, I can’t wear
nylon,

02:14:12.585 --> 02:14:16.705
I can’t wear anything artificial, really,
I can’t.

02:14:16.906 --> 02:14:22.219
For a while, if I even wear socks also,
My whole body starts paining.

02:14:22.420 --> 02:14:25.156
So, it is against you.

02:14:25.357 --> 02:14:34.531
Handmade things are few, I agree, but use
as far as possible handmade things.

02:14:34.732 --> 02:14:40.325
From the Mother Earth they make very nice,
say, terracotta.

02:14:40.526 --> 02:14:44.186
So, I’m a socialist by temperament,
I think.

02:14:44.387 --> 02:14:54.923
So, I felt a great urge that I should
really export nothing but terracotta.

02:14:55.440 --> 02:14:59.218
And terracotta is such a beautiful thing.

02:14:59.419 --> 02:15:04.159
It’s so soothing, it’s so good – it smells
so well.

02:15:04.360 --> 02:15:08.510
But people think, “No, we should buy
something that is made

02:15:08.711 --> 02:15:16.563
from America in some machinery thing.”
They go on buying like that.

02:15:17.757 --> 02:15:23.394
In America also I was surprised that
beautiful things are selling

02:15:23.595 --> 02:15:28.305
in shops which they call them as outlets,
very good,

02:15:28.583 --> 02:15:38.051
mostly of silk, or of cotton, and leather –
pure leather.

02:15:38.252 --> 02:15:41.723
But people will go to big, big markets
and buy all nonsense

02:15:41.924 --> 02:15:47.086
at a very high price and not from there –
means they have no wisdom.

02:15:47.265 --> 02:15:53.089
And this is what happens, that the wisdom,
if it is lacking in your sense,

02:15:53.289 --> 02:15:58.885
then this wisdom corrodes the society.

02:15:59.086 --> 02:16:04.218
Because wisdom itself shows

02:16:04.419 --> 02:16:10.483
how dangerous it is to go on buying all
these nonsensical things.

02:16:11.048 --> 02:16:16.017
Also now you are seeing that people
are taking now more

02:16:16.218 --> 02:16:20.194
to Ayurveda and to homeopathy.

02:16:20.395 --> 02:16:26.308
They don’t want to use these horrible
medicines produced by your great country.

02:16:26.509 --> 02:16:35.542
You know what they do, Swiss? They send
very big offers

02:16:35.743 --> 02:16:39.593
to doctors from India to come to work
for them.

02:16:39.794 --> 02:16:44.358
And supposing they have produced one “A”
sample as you’ve shown,

02:16:44.559 --> 02:16:48.499
then the same one they change a little bit
(and) say “It’s better”.

02:16:48.700 --> 02:16:54.288
And you know these medicines, most of them
are very dangerous and troublesome.

02:16:54.489 --> 02:16:58.512
By mistake, My family gave Me these
antibiotics.

02:16:58.713 --> 02:17:04.463
Since then My legs are very weak and
troublesome – I’ve improved, no doubt.

02:17:04.664 --> 02:17:08.293
So, you see, why we are now taking
to this -

02:17:08.494 --> 02:17:13.881
because pollution is there another thing,
which is created by this machinery.

02:17:14.082 --> 02:17:18.779
Gandhiji was saying: “There is no need
to use so much machinery.”

02:17:18.980 --> 02:17:25.080
Now, motor cars – we can walk, we can
use trains,

02:17:25.281 --> 02:17:31.368
but people want to go anywhere by motor
car, even if it is about, say,

02:17:31.569 --> 02:17:37.105
ten meters, they don’t want to walk.
That’s how our health has gone down.

02:17:37.306 --> 02:17:43.064
I must tell you when I was studying in the
school, My school was about five miles.

02:17:43.228 --> 02:17:50.809
And we had a car, and we had also horses,
and what we call is a buggy in our house.

02:17:51.010 --> 02:17:56.243
But it was compulsory for us to walk
five miles in the morning.

02:17:56.444 --> 02:17:59.029
Evening time the car used to come,

02:17:59.230 --> 02:18:05.614
but morning time we all had to walk
five miles to go to our school.

02:18:05.815 --> 02:18:11.672
And in between there was a small, little
mountain which we had to climb.

02:18:11.873 --> 02:18:18.965
That is how we learnt about nature. If you
don’t walk, from the car what do you know?

02:18:19.166 --> 02:18:23.196
At the most you can see some lamppost.

02:18:23.397 --> 02:18:29.178
What do you see from the car? Nothing,
you cannot see the nature.

02:18:29.378 --> 02:18:36.242
And this walking system is very much out
of date now for people. People don’t walk.

02:18:37.257 --> 02:18:44.062
I’m not saying that today we are very
changed, and we are very advanced people.

02:18:44.245 --> 02:18:49.324
In a way we have gone down because
we cannot walk.

02:18:49.525 --> 02:18:53.594
God has given these legs to walk, but
we cannot walk.

02:18:53.795 --> 02:19:00.107
We avoid walking. Now, because of that
so many cars.

02:19:01.001 --> 02:19:06.645
I know that in some families they have
five cars because 5 family members.

02:19:06.846 --> 02:19:11.312
Especially in Spain, I was surprised,
so many cars, so many cars

02:19:11.513 --> 02:19:16.314
and every car has only one person in it
sitting.

02:19:17.159 --> 02:19:21.792
Now, problem has started with the pollution
and all these things,

02:19:21.993 --> 02:19:28.439
because we have lost the habits
of depending upon ourselves.

02:19:29.180 --> 02:19:37.740
Now see what has happened in, say,

02:19:37.941 --> 02:19:44.237
this Kuala Lumpur and all these places
suffering from what you call, the smoke.

02:19:44.447 --> 02:19:49.229
Now I have not done it, if you think that
way. And they are praying to Allah,

02:19:49.430 --> 02:19:52.483
“Give us water”. Why should God give
them water

02:19:52.684 --> 02:19:57.541
when they are doing all kinds of
nonsensical things?

02:19:58.263 --> 02:20:03.024
Now, there is smoke going on, why? Because
they have cut the trees.

02:20:03.225 --> 02:20:11.499
So, why do they want to cut the trees?
Because they want to make money, that’s all.

02:20:11.700 --> 02:20:17.504
Their wood is coming to India, because in
India also they have cut the trees.

02:20:17.705 --> 02:20:21.910
If you go on like this – mad, you will have
pollution, means what?

02:20:22.111 --> 02:20:27.781
Is that, destructive forces will act
and stop it.

02:20:29.578 --> 02:20:33.550
For that you don’t have to pray to
the Goddess, it will work out.

02:20:33.727 --> 02:20:36.462
And it’s all working out everywhere.

02:20:36.663 --> 02:20:41.971
So, whatever you have to have, try to have
something which is handmade.

02:20:42.172 --> 02:20:49.239
Even your clothes - need not be many,
try to have it which are handmade -

02:20:50.672 --> 02:20:53.981
is one of the things Sahaja Yogis can do.

02:20:54.182 --> 02:20:59.870
There need not be to send money to this
Swiss Bank also.

02:21:00.031 --> 02:21:02.622
This Swiss Bank will be very badly exposed
now,

02:21:02.799 --> 02:21:06.577
I’m angry with them for one more thing,
that they had promised that they’ll give

02:21:06.778 --> 02:21:11.304
the money to the Jews and now they are
going like this, they don’t want to give.

02:21:11.505 --> 02:21:16.205
When they will die are they going
to take it with them?

02:21:19.553 --> 02:21:24.418
All these sins will be punished and that is
why I’m very happy

02:21:24.619 --> 02:21:27.469
this he has brought in, because I’ve been
talking about it –

02:21:27.670 --> 02:21:33.484
even in that conference I went to in China,
I talked openly about this Swiss Bank.

02:21:33.685 --> 02:21:40.093
I have talked to many magistrates and
to many, what you call them,

02:21:40.294 --> 02:21:44.813
the head of the law ministry and all that,
and I’ve told them,

02:21:45.014 --> 02:21:51.873
“Why not we have a conference and say
that this banking is nonsense”.

02:21:52.074 --> 02:22:02.196
Now, all types of bad people are taking
advantage of this system

02:22:02.397 --> 02:22:07.908
and are trying to make money, look very
nice or so, I don’t know.

02:22:08.109 --> 02:22:10.455
So many have lost their money there,

02:22:10.632 --> 02:22:13.187
I don’t know what was the need to put
all this money there.

02:22:13.388 --> 02:22:17.608
That when they die, their children do not
get anything.

02:22:17.809 --> 02:22:26.653
But the problem is this greed, is some sort
of a inner defect in a human being.

02:22:27.550 --> 02:22:38.562
He becomes greedy, greedy because he has
deviated from dharma.

02:22:40.322 --> 02:22:45.990
He thinks he can get pleasure out
of things, he cannot.

02:22:46.331 --> 02:22:51.613
And he goes on accumulating and buying
and this and that.

02:22:51.814 --> 02:22:58.876
I would say your Mother also does that.
I buy, but I buy things which are handmade.

02:22:59.082 --> 02:23:05.096
So that tomorrow, if I have to give it
presents, or if I have to sell off things,

02:23:05.297 --> 02:23:10.382
even the ornaments you have given Me,
I didn’t know what to do, I’m selling them.

02:23:10.583 --> 02:23:19.968
What will I do with the ornaments – I have
to buy so many ashrams, this, that.

02:23:20.169 --> 02:23:23.119
My family ornaments also I’m selling,

02:23:23.320 --> 02:23:27.713
because I spent money on My family things
also.

02:23:27.914 --> 02:23:34.925
Just think of it, what is all this for,
what pleasure does it give us?

02:23:35.108 --> 02:23:39.010
I can understand, if you want to give
somebody a present,

02:23:39.211 --> 02:23:45.844
or somebody you want to give some
happiness, joy – you should do it,

02:23:46.045 --> 02:23:53.163
but just for yourself go on, go on, how
much can you digest it? You cannot.

02:23:53.364 --> 02:23:56.991
Joy is much more in giving to others.

02:23:57.192 --> 02:24:05.480
It’s not, it’s not a thing that gives you
any understanding of the fundamentals,

02:24:05.681 --> 02:24:11.396
and the fundamentals is that you are
dharma.

02:24:11.597 --> 02:24:19.364
Within you is that, that is your valency,
and this materialism absolutely against it,

02:24:19.565 --> 02:24:32.012
because it creates all kinds of people:
mafias, this Swiss bank, cheats -

02:24:32.213 --> 02:24:37.035
we have communities after communities
who are known to be cheats,

02:24:37.236 --> 02:24:41.444
who are very materialistic, they have
no spiritual sense.

02:24:41.645 --> 02:24:46.228
So for Sahaja Yogis, I would say -
of course you have said all the mantras

02:24:46.429 --> 02:24:50.334
so I’m supposed to do all that.
But what you have to do

02:24:50.535 --> 02:24:55.890
is not to buy any more anything which is
not handmade. Try it.

02:24:56.091 --> 02:24:58.491
At least, there should be some embroidery,

02:24:58.692 --> 02:25:03.096
at least, there should be some work
done on it.

02:25:03.302 --> 02:25:07.694
I’m surprised that these things are
not very good for us,

02:25:07.895 --> 02:25:10.655
they are injurious to our health.

02:25:10.856 --> 02:25:15.995
So Sahaja Yogis must learn that they
have to walk.

02:25:16.196 --> 02:25:21.003
They must walk and they must see
the nature, what is in the nature.

02:25:21.204 --> 02:25:26.749
Many of you don’t know what - say, I ask
the name of this flower,

02:25:26.950 --> 02:25:30.133
how many of you know?

02:25:34.721 --> 02:25:43.036
It’s a very sweet name, “Kiss Me Quick”,
apart from its botanical name.

02:25:43.237 --> 02:25:47.326
But it is, you see, what I’m saying,
everything you should know -

02:25:47.527 --> 02:25:54.406
you should know about small, small things,
from where do this embroidery comes?

02:25:54.607 --> 02:25:57.690
From where does this sari comes?

02:25:57.891 --> 02:26:03.672
Our Indian men are the worst, I would say,
they don’t know anything whatsoever.

02:26:03.873 --> 02:26:07.939
But even western men also have the same
problem.

02:26:08.140 --> 02:26:12.198
You must take interest in things in which
you have not taken interest.

02:26:12.394 --> 02:26:16.675
For example, Indians don’t know how
to cook, they don’t know!

02:26:16.876 --> 02:26:20.122
Once My husband told Me that he knows
how to cook.

02:26:20.323 --> 02:26:24.497
I said, “What? He said, “I’ll make
chapatis, rotis.”

02:26:24.698 --> 02:26:30.893
And what he made was nothing –
Australia, America, this, that.

02:26:32.557 --> 02:26:38.642
But he said, “I give up because I was doing
shipping, but shipping means shipping.”

02:26:40.535 --> 02:26:47.829
But minute things you can see, what we
call is a subtle vision, subtle eyesight.

02:26:48.030 --> 02:26:53.952
If you walk, look at the nature, love
the trees, love the animals.

02:26:54.153 --> 02:26:57.878
You’ll be amazed, there are so many
things to be known

02:26:58.079 --> 02:27:01.809
than reading newspaper, what is there
to read in the newspaper?

02:27:02.010 --> 02:27:07.265
For hours together you go on reading
newspaper, next day you forget it.

02:27:07.466 --> 02:27:14.733
You’ll be amazed that they say that
for Goddess it is said that

02:27:14.934 --> 02:27:21.644
“Kataksha Kataksha Nirikshana” – every
glance, She knows everything.

02:27:21.845 --> 02:27:28.712
Any glance She puts on any man, woman
or anything, She knows where it is.

02:27:28.913 --> 02:27:31.984
And if you are My children you should
also try that,

02:27:32.145 --> 02:27:35.996
because I always used to run out
into jungles, in the forest,

02:27:36.197 --> 02:27:42.714
I used to go to all such places and really
enjoy the beautiful Mother,

02:27:42.915 --> 02:27:47.942
this Mother Earth who has created such
a beautiful thing.

02:27:48.143 --> 02:27:53.286
Have you noticed just now that the colors
of the background

02:27:53.487 --> 02:28:00.320
which were made by the Russians and
the colors of this facing thing

02:28:00.521 --> 02:28:06.802
are just the same, they have used the same
colors. It’s true collectivity.

02:28:07.003 --> 02:28:12.310
Now, you notice in the nature it’s so
matching, you know.

02:28:12.511 --> 02:28:15.189
Nothing gross, nothing loud – it’s
so beautiful,

02:28:15.390 --> 02:28:19.452
this is red but it has green to match it.

02:28:19.653 --> 02:28:23.151
This Mother Earth knows everything,
She understands everything,

02:28:23.352 --> 02:28:28.382
She does everything, but what do we do
for Mother Earth? –

02:28:28.583 --> 02:28:32.970
Is to run after artificial things,
machinery, this thing –

02:28:33.171 --> 02:28:36.957
and now a new thing has come, is computer.

02:28:38.401 --> 02:28:40.668
It’s all right if you want to write letters
to someone,

02:28:40.869 --> 02:28:43.882
but otherwise it’s quite maddening,
you know.

02:28:44.083 --> 02:28:48.001
And this computer will make our brain
absolutely zero.

02:28:48.202 --> 02:28:52.312
We’ll be paralyzed, we won’t be able
to think 2 + 2.

02:28:52.513 --> 02:28:57.673
So, anything that you want to use also,
should have its maryadas,

02:28:57.874 --> 02:29:01.492
don’t go beyond it. If you take
to swimming,

02:29:01.693 --> 02:29:04.969
you’ll go on swimming till you get sick.

02:29:05.183 --> 02:29:10.533
If you are horse-riding, you’ll go on
horse-riding till you fall down.

02:29:10.734 --> 02:29:17.396
You see, this is also a kind of a life
which has no maryadas –

02:29:17.597 --> 02:29:24.530
like greed has no maryadas, that’s how
also this kind of nonsense,

02:29:24.731 --> 02:29:28.134
“I am only fond of this, I am only
fond of this.”

02:29:28.335 --> 02:29:31.751
You are a human being, you should never
say like that.

02:29:31.952 --> 02:29:36.020
On the contrary you should say, “I must
learn this, I must know this,

02:29:36.221 --> 02:29:40.402
what is this all about?”. It is very
important,

02:29:40.603 --> 02:29:45.721
otherwise your personality will be a dwarf
personality –

02:29:45.922 --> 02:29:51.145
and ultimately people end up in money.
I don’t understand.

02:29:51.346 --> 02:29:55.391
I can’t even count 200 notes, can’t even.

02:29:55.592 --> 02:29:59.350
I don’t know about money, I should say.
But I’m good at mathematics -

02:29:59.551 --> 02:30:03.364
but I don’t know, whatever money you are
giving goes direct to them

02:30:03.565 --> 02:30:06.343
and they do it what they like. Now,
if somebody says,

02:30:06.544 --> 02:30:09.419
“How much You got for this?”
“I don’t know”.

02:30:09.620 --> 02:30:15.764
“How much for royalties?” “I don’t know”,
because I’m not interested.

02:30:15.965 --> 02:30:20.445
I’m not interested. What is there to be
so much interested in money?

02:30:20.646 --> 02:30:26.563
But I get money, all right, no problem,
never a problem.

02:30:26.764 --> 02:30:29.581
I sold one of My ornaments

02:30:29.782 --> 02:30:34.477
and I got at least 100 times more
than what I have spent.

02:30:34.677 --> 02:30:38.986
Maybe you might say it’s vibrations,
whatever you may say.

02:30:39.187 --> 02:30:49.931
So to get after money means you get
very much in the clutches of money.

02:30:50.558 --> 02:30:56.041
So what is the solution, to get rid
of this greed?

02:30:56.255 --> 02:31:01.697
Is to try and give it to others and see
the joy.

02:31:02.985 --> 02:31:11.120
Give something to others, share and see
the joy you feel by giving something.

02:31:13.427 --> 02:31:16.641
I must tell you, Gregoire is not her
but I am missing him

02:31:16.842 --> 02:31:22.146
because once I went to a sari shop
and wanted to buy one sari

02:31:22.347 --> 02:31:24.826
but I thought “It’s rather expensive,

02:31:25.027 --> 02:31:30.650
why should I buy such an expensive sari”,
came away.

02:31:30.851 --> 02:31:36.828
And you’ll be amazed, he gave Me the same
sari on My birthday

02:31:37.029 --> 02:31:41.540
and I was so filled with joy, because
he bought it next day,

02:31:41.741 --> 02:31:47.992
went and bought it from that shop, kept it
with him and on My birthday he gave Me.

02:31:50.393 --> 02:31:54.065
These small, small things can give you
great joy

02:31:54.266 --> 02:32:00.146
in giving people, other people,
not yourself.

02:32:00.347 --> 02:32:04.929
I don’t know if I have bought anything
much for Myself in My lifetime, never.

02:32:05.130 --> 02:32:07.411
Even if I go out shopping, even if
I am thirsty,

02:32:07.612 --> 02:32:11.729
I won’t even buy one Coca-Cola for Myself.

02:32:11.930 --> 02:32:16.072
People know that I don’t buy anything
for Myself,

02:32:16.273 --> 02:32:19.547
practically nothing, but you all give Me
so much, what to do.

02:32:19.748 --> 02:32:26.931
Now, I have decided that after these
75 years of age,

02:32:27.132 --> 02:32:30.861
I shouldn’t take anything from you
whatsoever.

02:32:31.062 --> 02:32:33.765
But to please you maybe, they are asking
that,

02:32:33.966 --> 02:32:38.637
“Only take a national, international”,
all right. But no more,

02:32:38.838 --> 02:32:43.567
every country shouldn’t bring. What
after all this national, international –

02:32:43.768 --> 02:32:49.120
you are all international people, what is
the need to bring any present for Me?

02:32:49.321 --> 02:32:53.482
I don’t even have time to see them.

02:32:54.389 --> 02:33:01.038
I’m so very busy with other things, because
there are so many problems in this world.

02:33:01.260 --> 02:33:04.965
So, I would suggest that, to get over
all these things

02:33:05.166 --> 02:33:09.147
we should see ourselves, what we are
doing about it.

02:33:09.356 --> 02:33:13.733
I’m sure none of you have money
in the Swiss Bank, thank God.

02:33:13.934 --> 02:33:20.035
But never earn more than what you can –
you have, there’s no need.

02:33:20.236 --> 02:33:24.909
Whatever comes your way is all right.
Of course if you are doing some work

02:33:25.110 --> 02:33:32.308
of creativity, of creating some designs,
creating something is all right.

02:33:33.199 --> 02:33:36.956
But don’t buy things, go on buying things
for yourself

02:33:37.157 --> 02:33:45.100
or putting then money here, hiding, hiding
there, there’s no need.

02:33:45.490 --> 02:33:51.003
You see, you’ll feel so satisfied and
so happy being honest,

02:33:51.204 --> 02:33:58.868
being absolutely beyond any problem.

02:33:59.171 --> 02:34:04.754
Now this mafia business is there, I agree
with you. Now this mafia can be controlled

02:34:04.955 --> 02:34:10.761
only by the government because they give
such a big tax.

02:34:10.962 --> 02:34:14.669
Now I mean, for example, an artisan
in this poor country -

02:34:14.870 --> 02:34:19.591
I will say poor because most of the people
are suffering from tax –

02:34:19.792 --> 02:34:26.047
you see, he has to pay 265 types of taxes.

02:34:27.165 --> 02:34:31.992
Italians are known for their art, they make
beautiful things,

02:34:32.193 --> 02:34:36.395
but they cannot because they have to pay
so much taxation.

02:34:36.596 --> 02:34:39.734
Only the designers they make the money.

02:34:39.934 --> 02:34:44.798
Designers make the money befooling
everybody.

02:34:46.349 --> 02:34:54.221
They befool people so much. Once My husband
went to Cairo and bought one scarf for Me.

02:34:55.469 --> 02:34:58.075
So, he said, “This is designer’s.”

02:34:58.276 --> 02:35:03.369
I said, “This looks Indian to me, this is
an Indian thing.”

02:35:03.570 --> 02:35:08.800
And surprisingly in the corner it was
written “Made in India”.

02:35:09.880 --> 02:35:16.896
He paid £25 for that, in India you can
get it for £2.

02:35:18.343 --> 02:35:22.354
So, this is another thing is to run a race
of eliteness.

02:35:22.555 --> 02:35:26.546
You see this one was bought by
My son-in-law.

02:35:26.747 --> 02:35:31.737
I said: “What is so special?”
He said, “It’s very great, you know.”

02:35:31.945 --> 02:35:35.707
I didn’t know what was so special about
those spectacles.

02:35:35.908 --> 02:35:42.132
So, I went to one shop in America

02:35:42.333 --> 02:35:45.317
and they all started saying, “Madam,
Madam, Madam …”.

02:35:45.518 --> 02:35:50.095
I said, “What is so Madam about Me?.
Why are they calling Me ‘Madam’?”

02:35:50.296 --> 02:35:56.832
“Oh, You don’t know?” - they said - “This
is Cartier.” I said, “Who is this Cartier?”

02:35:57.033 --> 02:36:01.546
So I’m going to put Kartikeya against him!

02:36:03.708 --> 02:36:11.703
All such stupid ideas, you see, and then
they bought Me a…

02:36:11.904 --> 02:36:20.412
[Aside: “What you call that? The watch was…
what was that watch? Ah, Patek Philippe!] -

02:36:20.613 --> 02:36:25.270
Patek Philippe, that watch they brought
for Me

02:36:25.471 --> 02:36:30.100
and it would not run in time. I said,
“What is this?

02:36:30.735 --> 02:36:35.155
Never keeps the time, it’s always
out of time.

02:36:35.741 --> 02:36:38.887
My vibrations must be trying some tricks”.

02:36:39.088 --> 02:36:42.853
So I gave it to one of them, I said, “Baba,
show this to the Patek Phillips.”

02:36:43.139 --> 02:36:47.134
Ah, that day Mathias was here. “This
will hit their ego, Mother, very much”.

02:36:47.335 --> 02:36:51.280
I said, “Why?” “Because they think
they are the best.”

02:36:51.947 --> 02:36:56.109
I said, “Whatever it is, tell them you
change it, it doesn’t keep to time.”

02:36:56.310 --> 02:36:59.830
Then I asked My daughter to have it,
I said, “Baba, I can’t make …

02:37:00.031 --> 02:37:04.396
I don’t know why, maybe I will have
something simple, it’s better.”

02:37:04.597 --> 02:37:10.760
That too again turned out to be a,
what you call? ‘Designers’.

02:37:10.961 --> 02:37:15.631
They are now all - most of these designers
are in jail.

02:37:15.832 --> 02:37:20.904
And some of them met Me when I was
coming from Russia.

02:37:21.105 --> 02:37:25.592
They are absolutely useless people,
you know.

02:37:25.793 --> 02:37:28.513
They take out some idea and sell it
for a high price

02:37:28.722 --> 02:37:37.376
and if you are a fool you go and buy that.
Did you notice that this is Cartier?

02:37:39.809 --> 02:37:45.607
For Sahaja Yogis are simple people. Now
this is the thing is that there are,

02:37:45.831 --> 02:37:49.065
these are also mafias, I tell you, these
are also mafias.

02:37:49.266 --> 02:37:53.211
And these mafias are exploiting you,
I’ve written it in My book also,

02:37:53.412 --> 02:37:57.825
if you read it, how these entrepreneurs
are trying to befool you.

02:37:58.026 --> 02:38:04.864
You wear simple dress, simple from
handmade – will be much better

02:38:05.065 --> 02:38:11.294
than to wear something that makes you
look like something out of the blue.

02:38:12.060 --> 02:38:17.465
And there is no need because it is just
satisfying your ego.

02:38:17.666 --> 02:38:27.220
Some people have a habit – as soon as –
say, I have, supposing some dinner set,

02:38:27.421 --> 02:38:31.986
may not be good or… - they’ll come and see
the back of the dinner plate.

02:38:32.187 --> 02:38:36.900
“Ah, from where did You get it?” –
“I don’t know.” “You don’t know?”

02:38:37.101 --> 02:38:41.072
“No, no, this was, I think, I think somebody
gave Me, I don’t know, I don’t know.”

02:38:41.286 --> 02:38:44.029
“No, no, You better find out, because
very nice.”

02:38:44.197 --> 02:38:47.318
Next day they’ll go round the whole place
to find out

02:38:47.519 --> 02:38:51.299
if they can get the same dinner set.

02:38:51.500 --> 02:38:55.922
And Sahaja Yoga is just the opposite.
I tell you, you depend on Sahaja Yoga.

02:38:56.123 --> 02:39:05.684
Once My husband liked one tea set. So
you know London has huge, big stores.

02:39:05.885 --> 02:39:09.736
Some of them are really horrid.
I went there –

02:39:09.937 --> 02:39:13.972
baarpre baap - we walked and walked
and walked through so many.

02:39:14.173 --> 02:39:17.958
They said, “All right, we promise after
6 months.” Another said, “7 months”,

02:39:18.159 --> 02:39:25.554
another said, “8 months, you give us
the order.” So I gave up the idea.

02:39:25.842 --> 02:39:28.543
Then C.P. said, “What has happened
to their factories?”

02:39:28.773 --> 02:39:31.576
I said, “They don’t have anything, they
are exporting.”

02:39:31.777 --> 02:39:38.740
Then I went to Australia, you’ll be amazed
- and there for a special price,

02:39:38.941 --> 02:39:44.862
just for propagating, they had put
these tea sets there.

02:39:45.584 --> 02:39:51.130
Imagine, in Australia, and I got it
for the half price.

02:39:51.747 --> 02:39:57.851
So, if you don’t have greed you get
what you want just there.

02:40:00.178 --> 02:40:03.539
Just there you get it.

02:40:04.493 --> 02:40:09.973
But if you have greed, then God makes
you dance. All right?

02:40:10.183 --> 02:40:14.655
That is what is so simple as that -
whatever you want you can get it,

02:40:14.856 --> 02:40:18.372
if you don’t have greed about it.

02:40:18.579 --> 02:40:24.361
That’s such an enslaving thing within us,
that we have greed.

02:40:24.562 --> 02:40:31.067
I mean I can give you 1,001 examples
of that, 1,001.

02:40:31.268 --> 02:40:37.225
That if you don’t ask for anything, if you
don’t desire for anything,

02:40:37.426 --> 02:40:43.519
you get what you need, whatever you need
you get.

02:40:44.178 --> 02:40:51.433
But if you go on desiring, then go mad
after it. Go there, get this and get lost.

02:40:51.805 --> 02:40:55.274
And then the thing also gets lost.

02:40:55.475 --> 02:41:02.722
That’s why it is said, better try
to develop a detachment.

02:41:03.060 --> 02:41:08.085
It’s all right, if it is there well and
good, if it is not there, doesn’t matter.

02:41:09.338 --> 02:41:13.049
Then you’ll be surprised your attention
will be so subtle.

02:41:13.250 --> 02:41:19.222
Now none of you I think have seen these
beautiful flowers, what are there.

02:41:19.423 --> 02:41:25.022
The beautiful embroidery that is there.
The way they have done this.

02:41:25.223 --> 02:41:30.322
Now can you tell Me how many there are,
hands in this work –

02:41:32.803 --> 02:41:42.169
14, 28. This side 14, this side 14.

02:41:48.231 --> 02:41:53.894
I mean, inclusive of all these other
things.

02:41:55.359 --> 02:42:01.211
So you don’t notice anything and your
attention becomes…

02:42:01.412 --> 02:42:06.032
“Mahamaya” - they say has been - “it has
been the Mahamaya”. This is no explanation.

02:42:06.233 --> 02:42:13.035
Your attention if it is clear, is simple,
you can see the thing clearly.

02:42:14.677 --> 02:42:20.002
And with that attention only, that
attention yourself

02:42:20.886 --> 02:42:23.475
takes you to the right place where you
have to go,

02:42:23.676 --> 02:42:27.574
you get the right thing what you want
to buy.

02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:35.375
Can you tell Me you see these carpets
are from where?

02:42:41.555 --> 02:42:44.901
They are mostly from Russia.

02:42:46.613 --> 02:42:55.354
I went to Russia and I saw this carpet
factory. They have no sense of export also.

02:42:55.555 --> 02:43:00.599
So I told them that, “How much will
a carpet cost?” - Doctor knows -

02:43:00.800 --> 02:43:06.223
They said, “Only $20.” I said, “Baba,
$20 for a carpet?”

02:43:06.424 --> 02:43:10.307
So, I told Doctor, “Now what to do,
we have to buy many”.

02:43:10.508 --> 02:43:15.656
I said, “How much for export?” “$200.”

02:43:16.234 --> 02:43:20.362
I said, “In India the other way round.
If you have to export something,

02:43:20.563 --> 02:43:25.878
then the price is less.” I said,
“All right,

02:43:26.079 --> 02:43:30.013
so I guess we must think of the solution
because I need it.”

02:43:30.214 --> 02:43:34.451
So I asked about 20 Sahaja Yogis to go
and buy each one.

02:43:34.659 --> 02:43:39.894
To Russians they give for $20.
I said, “All right, you bring these.”

02:43:41.070 --> 02:43:47.222
So, you should go in for solutions and not
for problems.

02:43:47.423 --> 02:43:52.456
Greed is a problem, greed is a problem.

02:43:52.657 --> 02:43:55.553
How to get rid of the greed is the point.

02:43:55.754 --> 02:43:59.403
And to get rid of the greed is that
if I buy something –

02:43:59.604 --> 02:44:04.913
for whom should I buy this one, for whom
should I buy?

02:44:05.114 --> 02:44:10.724
Ah, this will be all right for another
friend of mine, like that.

02:44:10.925 --> 02:44:17.730
If you train your mind on these lines,
not for yourself, but for others,

02:44:17.931 --> 02:44:23.935
then you’ll be amazed this greed will run
away and you’ll have joy.

02:44:24.729 --> 02:44:29.322
As you want to give Me things, I understand
that, I also want to give you.

02:44:29.523 --> 02:44:35.336
In the same way, think of all others,
they are all brothers and sisters.

02:44:36.228 --> 02:44:40.588
From other countries, make friends
with other countries.

02:44:40.789 --> 02:44:44.759
If giving is there, then this greed goes
away (indistinct)

02:44:44.960 --> 02:44:50.613
and you get what you want. It’s a very
simple mantra.

02:44:52.350 --> 02:45:02.189
It’s surprising, so far, with all
the miracles,

02:45:02.390 --> 02:45:07.275
we don’t understand that whatever
we need also be provided for.

02:45:07.476 --> 02:45:14.574
But you must need it, not for stupid
collection of things.

02:45:15.905 --> 02:45:21.232
This was a very, very good thing, acted
very well, I enjoyed it thoroughly,

02:45:21.433 --> 02:45:27.463
this Swiss Bank laundering. I know
My country suffers from it.

02:45:28.105 --> 02:45:33.155
Now, the another drama, which was done
by the English,

02:45:33.356 --> 02:45:39.361
shows – it’s a – “Pilgrim’s Progress” is
an old, quite an old drama,

02:45:39.562 --> 02:45:44.698
which I have read long time back. But this
is the real pilgrims they have shown,

02:45:44.899 --> 02:45:49.587
how a seeker goes into wrong ways, methods,

02:45:49.788 --> 02:45:54.225
and throughout they have very nicely
brought in how even a Sahaja Yogi,

02:45:54.426 --> 02:46:00.206
while rising, falls into different pits.
So it’s a very good thing for you to know

02:46:00.407 --> 02:46:05.820
that if you are Sahaja Yogis, you should be
very careful, and you should see that

02:46:06.021 --> 02:46:13.058
you don’t fall into these pits and
ultimately the ego and superego.

02:46:13.848 --> 02:46:21.549
In the west the problem is more of ego,
not of superego. And for ego,

02:46:26.367 --> 02:46:33.922
to accept that you have ego is the only
way; and then it will drop out.

02:46:34.123 --> 02:46:38.457
If you know there is ego, ego will
drop out.

02:46:39.402 --> 02:46:44.541
The simple thing is to know that you have
ego. Ego of something.

02:46:44.742 --> 02:46:47.990
People have ego of any nonsense, you know.

02:46:48.191 --> 02:46:51.370
There was one lady very proud
and egoistical.

02:46:51.571 --> 02:46:57.675
So I asked about her, “What is the matter
with her?”

02:46:57.876 --> 02:47:00.996
“Because she knows how to make dolls” –
Why?

02:47:01.197 --> 02:47:04.829
That should give you ego or what?
I didn’t understand that part.

02:47:05.030 --> 02:47:08.776
But this is what it is, even for small
things people have ego,

02:47:08.977 --> 02:47:17.025
and all this designing and all that
is based on your stupid ego

02:47:17.226 --> 02:47:21.633
which makes you buy all these things
to show off your ego.

02:47:21.834 --> 02:47:29.295
So try to be humble – humble and try
to understand

02:47:29.496 --> 02:47:34.452
that all these worldly things we are not
going to take them with us.

02:47:34.653 --> 02:47:37.339
They are going to lie down here. I am not
saying you renounce.

02:47:37.553 --> 02:47:41.485
I’m not saying you take sanyasa, but you
should know that

02:47:41.686 --> 02:47:45.493
the value of these things is nothing
compared to you.

02:47:45.694 --> 02:47:48.159
When ego comes, this idiocity comes in.

02:47:48.360 --> 02:47:54.844
You think by wearing something great
you are very much influencing others.

02:47:55.045 --> 02:48:02.178
You may, but those who are influenced
are another set of fools, I must say.

02:48:02.379 --> 02:48:09.381
Once I was wearing a ring and I went
to shopping in one of the places

02:48:09.582 --> 02:48:13.007
and they were so respectful to Me.
I said, “Suddenly the shopkeepers,

02:48:13.208 --> 02:48:17.998
they never respect Me because I’m
an Indian – what has happened?”

02:48:18.160 --> 02:48:22.248
So I had gone to a shop where the lady
was known to Me.

02:48:22.449 --> 02:48:28.277
She said, “May I ask You, is this real?”
I said, “What do you mean, real?”

02:48:28.478 --> 02:48:33.933
“Is it a real emerald?” “Yes, yes, very old
from My family.”

02:48:34.158 --> 02:48:37.862
“Ah, so Your family very rich?”

02:48:38.063 --> 02:48:44.197
“No, no, it was from My forefathers,
I’m just wearing that.”

02:48:44.398 --> 02:48:49.453
“Oh my God, if it is real, what will be
the price?” I said, “How will I know,

02:48:49.654 --> 02:48:53.943
it was bought long time back, I don’t know
the price.” “No, can you get me one?”

02:48:54.144 --> 02:48:58.388
I said, “Why do you want to have it,
you can have this one if you like.”

02:48:58.589 --> 02:49:06.047
Like that, you know, a small thing makes
them so…, that you are so great. It’s not.

02:49:06.248 --> 02:49:10.018
What is the greatest thing in us is
our Spirit,

02:49:10.219 --> 02:49:14.932
is the Spirit that we have and we should
know that we should be proud of it,

02:49:15.133 --> 02:49:17.876
that we have got the Spirit within us.

02:49:18.077 --> 02:49:23.607
And if you become proud, then you will not
do nonsensical things.

02:49:23.808 --> 02:49:27.298
You are people who are all realized souls.

02:49:27.499 --> 02:49:32.368
And already, you have crossed over this
pilgrims stage, you are much above that.

02:49:32.569 --> 02:49:36.940
Now the greatest thing is to know that
we are spiritual people

02:49:37.141 --> 02:49:44.757
and as spiritual people – you even
dominate Me, in a way.

02:49:44.958 --> 02:49:48.864
If you all desire for something, I can’t
get over it.

02:49:49.064 --> 02:49:56.055
I have to accept. I have to keep you
pleased.

02:49:56.256 --> 02:50:00.919
Many things I’m doing just because
you want it;

02:50:01.120 --> 02:50:06.203
doesn’t matter, it doesn’t matter to Me
because nothing comes over My head.

02:50:06.404 --> 02:50:09.608
So it’s all right, whatever children want,
let them do.

02:50:09.809 --> 02:50:16.846
But the one point is this ego has to be
really under control.

02:50:17.852 --> 02:50:21.457
There’s one little more point I want
to tell you,

02:50:21.658 --> 02:50:23.698
because tomorrow I may not be able to say,

02:50:23.899 --> 02:50:28.389
in Navaratri, you see, I am bound by other
things, is this –

02:50:28.590 --> 02:50:34.737
I wanted to talk to people who are married
in Sahaja Yoga, especially to the ladies.

02:50:34.938 --> 02:50:41.947
I think some of them are extremely
dominating and stupid.

02:50:42.280 --> 02:50:48.459
What is marriage? Marriage is honeymoon
as they call it.

02:50:48.660 --> 02:50:53.655
Honey is the essence and moon is the peace.

02:50:53.856 --> 02:50:59.988
Now if the women are quarrelsome,
fighting, sarcastic,

02:51:00.189 --> 02:51:04.618
it is absolutely a hell for man.

02:51:05.944 --> 02:51:11.865
Instead of that, if woman knows
the essence, the honey,

02:51:12.066 --> 02:51:18.055
she should know how to please the husband,
to bring peace in the family.

02:51:18.256 --> 02:51:23.127
Now some of the husbands are drunkards
or anything – not in Sahaja Yoga.

02:51:23.272 --> 02:51:26.613
What pleases the husband?

02:51:28.125 --> 02:51:31.512
You see, in a way, it’s a trick.

02:51:31.713 --> 02:51:37.407
It’s a trick of a realized soul, how
to please others.

02:51:37.608 --> 02:51:42.471
What do we do to our husbands?
Do we try to please?

02:51:42.672 --> 02:51:46.332
First of all find out what he likes.

02:51:48.060 --> 02:51:51.027
My husband, I would say - he’s gone away,
thank God -

02:51:51.228 --> 02:51:54.093
he used to say, “You shouldn’t wear
any flower in your head.”

02:51:54.294 --> 02:51:58.836
But in Maharashtra all the married women
are supposed to wear flowers.

02:51:59.037 --> 02:52:04.532
Since that day I have never worn any flower
in My head.

02:52:04.733 --> 02:52:10.404
It’s all right, doesn’t matter, he didn’t
know what I was,

02:52:10.605 --> 02:52:13.960
so he said, “Don’t wear any flowers,
I don’t like.” Then he said,

02:52:14.161 --> 02:52:17.589
“You must wear bangles” because he comes
from a very traditional family.

02:52:17.790 --> 02:52:24.672
All My life I have worn bangles. It pleases
him, what’s the matter?

02:52:24.873 --> 02:52:28.362
Little, little things you do just to please
him,

02:52:28.539 --> 02:52:32.650
then he also starts thinking, “See, what
should I do for My wife?”.

02:52:32.851 --> 02:52:37.425
But first it must start from woman,
not from man,

02:52:37.626 --> 02:52:41.058
because women are responsible
for the society.

02:52:41.259 --> 02:52:47.537
In the western culture they had not told
what is their job is.

02:52:47.738 --> 02:52:52.353
Man’s job is economics, politics,
money earning.

02:52:52.554 --> 02:52:58.029
They have made a mess out of it, I agree
with you. It’s quite a big mess.

02:52:58.230 --> 02:53:02.649
But your job is to make the society.

02:53:02.850 --> 02:53:07.409
And to make the society, first you must
know how to keep children pleased,

02:53:07.610 --> 02:53:11.993
how to keep your husband pleased, how
to help and be close to them (Unclear).

02:53:12.194 --> 02:53:17.626
On the contrary, if you try all the time
to dominate,

02:53:17.827 --> 02:53:20.430
that’s not your job to dominate at all.

02:53:20.631 --> 02:53:29.490
Your job is to make neutralize his
domination by simple, simple things.

02:53:30.347 --> 02:53:36.043
I’ll give you an example. Thank God
he is not here!

02:53:37.753 --> 02:53:44.152
He knows, he knows I’m very, I am very
clever in certain things.

02:53:44.353 --> 02:53:49.940
In his office he had a gentleman. I never
used to interfere with his office.

02:53:50.141 --> 02:53:53.116
But there was one gentleman, good one,

02:53:53.317 --> 02:53:57.287
who gave up his organization and joined
another one

02:53:57.488 --> 02:54:01.338
because it was a private one, he was
getting more money, so he joined that.

02:54:01.539 --> 02:54:08.434
But there he found it was horrible, so he
wanted to come back to Shipping Corporation.

02:54:09.208 --> 02:54:12.171
But My husband is very particular about
rules and regulations.

02:54:12.372 --> 02:54:15.196
He said, “No, no, no, now I won’t have you,
I don’t want to see your face, get out”,

02:54:15.397 --> 02:54:22.224
this thing, that (thing). So he came to Me.
Normally, I never interfere.

02:54:22.425 --> 02:54:26.622
He came to Me and he said, “If You tell
him he might listen.”

02:54:26.823 --> 02:54:32.196
I said, “No, if I tell him he will never
listen. But I know how to do it.”

02:54:32.397 --> 02:54:36.903
So I told him that this gentleman came
to see Me.

02:54:37.104 --> 02:54:41.702
“Ha, so he’s come to the right person, now
are you going to trouble me about it?”

02:54:41.903 --> 02:54:46.656
I said, “No, no, no, not Me, but just think
why he came to Me.”

02:54:46.857 --> 02:54:50.782
He said, “Why?” “Because he thinks I’m more
generous than you are.”

02:54:50.983 --> 02:54:54.848
Immediately this competition.

02:55:00.283 --> 02:55:03.384
And that fellow got the job, he was
a great friend of his,

02:55:03.585 --> 02:55:06.550
even in London he was helping him a lot.

02:55:06.751 --> 02:55:12.702
So, when we think that we have to control
our husband,

02:55:12.903 --> 02:55:17.404
it’s better to do it in a very simple way.

02:55:19.211 --> 02:55:23.107
Only on fundamentals you can put down
your foot.

02:55:23.308 --> 02:55:26.788
Otherwise for small, small things,

02:55:26.989 --> 02:55:31.572
if you go on dominating your husband
I tell you, you will miss the point.

02:55:31.773 --> 02:55:38.205
You have married for stupidity or
for honeymoon?

02:55:39.650 --> 02:55:44.427
And in the West, especially in Italy, we
have had very bad experiences of women.

02:55:44.628 --> 02:55:49.369
English also, I must say. English girls
also have given Me lot of trouble.

02:55:49.570 --> 02:55:55.110
I mean, they are banned now, because
I can’t help it.

02:55:55.311 --> 02:56:00.946
One girl from Sri Lanka she was married
to somebody in…

02:56:01.147 --> 02:56:03.518
[Aside, maybe to a child: “Sit down,
sit down”] -

02:56:03.719 --> 02:56:08.294
she was married to somebody in USA.

02:56:08.495 --> 02:56:15.849
Imagine from that horrible Sri Lanka where
there’s everyday at least 30 murders,

02:56:16.050 --> 02:56:19.527
she got such a good chance to go to USA.

02:56:19.728 --> 02:56:26.793
Of course, USA’s also not a very great
place - but she started behaving

02:56:26.994 --> 02:56:33.325
as if she is a childish person and talking
to him in such a manner.

02:56:33.526 --> 02:56:38.965
He told Me “Mother, she is a sadist.
Whenever I telephone to her she talks to me

02:56:39.166 --> 02:56:44.551
in such a sarcastic manner and this
and that, that I’m surprised.”

02:56:44.752 --> 02:56:48.463
I said, “A lady from Sri Lanka? I can’t
believe it!”

02:56:48.664 --> 02:56:53.738
Then he told Me what she talked to him and
how she talked to him. I was amazed.

02:56:53.939 --> 02:56:57.505
I mean, no man would be happy to hear
all these things.

02:56:57.689 --> 02:57:04.223
But she thought she was very friendly, and
she was joking or something like that.

02:57:04.424 --> 02:57:08.363
This doesn’t work out in marriage.

02:57:09.296 --> 02:57:18.929
Man doesn’t want a wife to be on the horse
and beating with a whip.

02:57:19.130 --> 02:57:22.058
Why has he married?

02:57:22.259 --> 02:57:29.244
For the happiness, for the joy, for
the sweetness of a woman.

02:57:32.843 --> 02:57:35.235
It’s a very important thing I wanted
to talk

02:57:35.436 --> 02:57:40.404
because so many of women are thinking
that they are something great.

02:57:40.605 --> 02:57:43.855
Some of them have some money, some of them
have some jobs,

02:57:44.056 --> 02:57:48.967
but first job is to keep the society
very happy

02:57:49.168 --> 02:57:53.459
and to keep your husband happy –
is the first job.

02:57:53.941 --> 02:57:59.485
If a woman cannot keep the husband happy,
she is no good for us.

02:57:59.652 --> 02:58:04.723
She is no good Sahaja Yogini. This is
a place, like a man

02:58:04.924 --> 02:58:08.068
who is working in the office, he has
to keep his boss pleased.

02:58:08.269 --> 02:58:12.202
If he doesn’t please his boss, he is
useless, he’s thrown out of.

02:58:12.403 --> 02:58:18.789
In the same way a woman has to think about
the husband, in a very kindly manner,

02:58:18.990 --> 02:58:24.413
because this is her job, this is why
she is marrying.

02:58:24.614 --> 02:58:28.909
Otherwise she should not marry, she can do
what she likes.

02:58:30.070 --> 02:58:35.418
It’s a difficult thing to convince anyone

02:58:35.595 --> 02:58:39.578
because, you see, men are right-sided,
they are hot-tempered.

02:58:39.779 --> 02:58:47.112
But I have told you just now how to capture
their anger.

02:58:49.251 --> 02:58:53.241
I’ve seen also in the films, you see
all romantic scenes going on –

02:58:53.442 --> 02:58:56.114
it never happens, there’s nobody is
like that,

02:58:56.315 --> 02:58:59.132
you see, it’s all absurd things you see,

02:58:59.333 --> 02:59:04.669
so you expect them to be Clark Gable
or somebody, it’s not so.

02:59:06.848 --> 02:59:12.837
You have to love, you have to take
your husband into your heart first.

02:59:13.038 --> 02:59:17.898
This is your duty, otherwise what else
are you doing?

02:59:22.109 --> 02:59:25.247
I was shocked, a girl from Sri Lanka -
and this boy has said,

02:59:25.448 --> 02:59:29.195
“Mother, you can kill me, but I will not
have that girl here,

02:59:29.396 --> 02:59:33.692
because she is not joy-giving.”
It’s a fact.

02:59:33.893 --> 02:59:39.126
So if your wife is like that supposing -
now I am telling men.

02:59:40.764 --> 02:59:44.157
The trick of the trade is, if your wife
is like that,

02:59:44.358 --> 02:59:47.839
try to understand why she does it.

02:59:48.040 --> 02:59:52.844
What is her problem, why is she
dominating you?

02:59:53.045 --> 02:59:58.632
Or you think she is dominating you. Most
of the times, most of the men who talk,

02:59:58.833 --> 03:00:03.745
“Oh, wives are like this, wives”… they are
very dominating.

03:00:03.946 --> 03:00:09.426
Why is she dominating you, what’s wrong
with you, that she is dominating?

03:00:09.627 --> 03:00:15.606
If you introspect, you’ll find that you
give very little time to her.

03:00:15.807 --> 03:00:20.059
Now, the other part is, there was one lady,
she wanted to have a divorce.

03:00:20.260 --> 03:00:24.218
I said, “Why?” “Because he goes to work
all the time

03:00:24.419 --> 03:00:28.873
and he is not there and this and that.”

03:00:29.189 --> 03:00:32.530
But I said, “If you divorce, then you will
never be with him.

03:00:32.731 --> 03:00:38.136
So why do you want to have a divorce?
At least, at least he gives you some time,

03:00:38.337 --> 03:00:42.365
but if you divorce, then he’ll never be
with you, so why do you ask for divorce?”

03:00:42.566 --> 03:00:45.356
I can’t understand the logic.

03:00:45.557 --> 03:00:50.054
I mean women should not be brainless,
isn’t it - to say such a thing.

03:00:50.255 --> 03:00:55.766
If you want to divorce your husband
for this – it’s absurd.

03:00:56.432 --> 03:01:05.036
Now, for men it is important that they
should give some time,

03:01:05.237 --> 03:01:11.386
pay some attention and get some things
that they like.

03:01:12.993 --> 03:01:15.579
Now, I’ll give you again My own example.

03:01:15.780 --> 03:01:20.595
My husband never brought any flowers
for Me, you all bring flowers for Me,

03:01:20.796 --> 03:01:26.144
but he never brought any flowers for Me,
whether it was birthday or anything.

03:01:26.345 --> 03:01:30.889
Then I realized that this man has no sense
of flowers.

03:01:31.090 --> 03:01:36.354
He doesn’t know what is a rose or what is
any other flower.

03:01:36.555 --> 03:01:40.718
And he might bring something which is
horrible, you know.

03:01:40.919 --> 03:01:44.174
Maybe (a) cactus he might bring.

03:01:44.825 --> 03:01:50.828
It’s better he doesn’t bring anything,
because that would be insulting, isn’t it?

03:01:51.029 --> 03:01:54.659
And then one day he admitted, “I don’t know
anything about flowers,

03:01:54.860 --> 03:01:59.929
now will you tell me – except for roses,
I don’t know anything.”

03:02:00.114 --> 03:02:03.898
And you’ll be amazed, even roses, he misses
out (for that? Indistinct).

03:02:04.099 --> 03:02:06.706
So, with such an ignorance of things,

03:02:06.907 --> 03:02:11.822
if your husband doesn’t do, it shows
consideration.

03:02:13.342 --> 03:02:20.679
But men should try to know what a woman
likes, what she wants.

03:02:20.880 --> 03:02:25.460
Moreover, men have their own style
of thinking.

03:02:25.668 --> 03:02:33.896
Now, to give My own example again,
better (it) is.

03:02:34.159 --> 03:02:37.008
He buys always very expensive things.

03:02:37.209 --> 03:02:41.444
So, I’ve told him, “Don’t buy anything
for Me.” So, “You don’t like?”

03:02:41.645 --> 03:02:46.696
“No, no, I like it, but too much of these
too expensive things, why should you buy?”

03:02:46.897 --> 03:02:52.279
So, he is very fond of buying these kind
of sweaters from that Scotch House,

03:02:52.480 --> 03:02:57.422
very expensive they are, £250 each,
you know.

03:02:57.623 --> 03:03:02.727
I don’t know how many I have, how many
in black, how many, you see.

03:03:02.928 --> 03:03:08.691
I told him, “I’ll get it from Switzerland,
they are much cheaper there” and all that.

03:03:08.892 --> 03:03:13.042
Then another is he wants to buy a cashmere
coat for Me, always.

03:03:13.219 --> 03:03:16.861
I must be having at least 10 of them
hanging,

03:03:17.062 --> 03:03:20.784
but he likes to give that only – all right.

03:03:20.985 --> 03:03:25.640
So, I’m passing out them to My daughters,
granddaughters and all that.

03:03:25.841 --> 03:03:29.794
Then what to do now? You see, men –
he doesn’t mean anything bad,

03:03:29.995 --> 03:03:35.615
but because he doesn’t know, doesn’t know.

03:03:35.816 --> 03:03:40.648
First thing he did was to, when in India,
before going to the Puja,

03:03:40.849 --> 03:03:47.516
he went to buy a sari for Me. The one
of My nephews went with him.

03:03:47.717 --> 03:03:54.254
So he says, “Give me the most expensive
sari that you have.”

03:03:54.455 --> 03:03:57.388
So these people thought there’s somebody
has come now.

03:03:57.589 --> 03:04:02.258
The shopkeepers could understand this
gentleman doesn’t know anything of it.

03:04:02.459 --> 03:04:06.033
So they brought out a sari, said,
“This is the most expensive,

03:04:06.234 --> 03:04:10.143
the price is 45,000 rupees” – in those
days this was.

03:04:10.344 --> 03:04:13.395
“All right, all right, you give me. I have
a card, will you take the card?”

03:04:13.596 --> 03:04:16.967
“Yes, yes, we’ll take the card.” He bought
the sari for Me.

03:04:17.168 --> 03:04:22.949
It is so heavy, it is so heavy that it was
something…

03:04:23.150 --> 03:04:28.321
[Hindi aside]

03:04:28.531 --> 03:04:31.761
That… what do you call that, arm.. – you
wear… Some yogis: Armor.

03:04:31.975 --> 03:04:35.897
Shri Mataji: Eh? Some yogis: Armor.
Shri Mataji: Very heavy, you know.

03:04:36.098 --> 03:04:39.989
I said, “Now what?”
He said, “You must wear for the Puja."

03:04:40.190 --> 03:04:44.511
I was walking like a giant, you know.

03:04:50.740 --> 03:04:55.063
There’s a description of your Mother is
“Ati saumya Ati raudra” –

03:04:55.264 --> 03:04:59.299
She is extremely soft and extremely
terrible.

03:04:59.500 --> 03:05:02.576
But, I don’t know with that sari,
how I sat!

03:05:02.777 --> 03:05:07.008
I sat in one place glued down into that.

03:05:07.209 --> 03:05:12.468
Now to get up I didn’t know how to get up
with that weight on My body. You see?

03:05:12.669 --> 03:05:18.180
And then I brought it and put it properly
in a box and this and that.

03:05:18.381 --> 03:05:21.768
So he said, “When are you wearing that
next?” “Now,” I said, “Please,

03:05:21.969 --> 03:05:25.902
I’ve kept it nicely for one wedding,
I’ll wear sometime.”

03:05:26.103 --> 03:05:31.998
I promised him and kept it there, because
he doesn’t understand about saris.

03:05:32.752 --> 03:05:35.276
I know he doesn’t understand about saris.

03:05:35.441 --> 03:05:40.322
So if he doesn’t understand, whatever
he buys, I say “All right”.

03:05:40.523 --> 03:05:43.206
And he spends so much money on those
things, you know,

03:05:43.407 --> 03:05:49.735
45,000 rupees for such a sari...
[Hindi words]

03:05:49.959 --> 03:05:56.488
So he doesn’t understand what is real,
what is unreal, nothing – doesn’t matter.

03:05:56.689 --> 03:06:01.562
You have to just see his heart, how he
is giving you,

03:06:01.763 --> 03:06:05.002
with what love he is giving you. He doesn’t
understand.

03:06:05.203 --> 03:06:08.300
So what can you do, poor man, you know.

03:06:08.500 --> 03:06:13.992
I always buy suit lengths for him or suits
for him, I always – Myself.

03:06:14.193 --> 03:06:17.138
Once he said, “All right, I’m going to buy
this time.” I said, “Better buy.”

03:06:17.339 --> 03:06:20.826
He bought such a horrible one and he went
to the office

03:06:21.027 --> 03:06:25.983
and everybody said, “Sir, this is not
your taste.”

03:06:28.979 --> 03:06:31.171
So he threw it away, he said, “I will never
buy now,

03:06:31.372 --> 03:06:34.116
can you, better go and buy for myself.”

03:06:34.317 --> 03:06:39.432
See, it’s - but the trouble is if women
take interest and know

03:06:39.633 --> 03:06:42.332
what sort of color he will like and this
and that.

03:06:42.533 --> 03:06:48.484
And also public opinion is very important
for men, for example what the public says.

03:06:48.685 --> 03:06:53.370
Like once I painted My drawing room
with a very nice color,

03:06:53.571 --> 03:06:59.208
pink and black film mixed – very nice.
Because it’s a sign of warmth.

03:06:59.394 --> 03:07:01.006
He said, “What is this color you have
put it?

03:07:01.207 --> 03:07:04.296
You should have done this and that”,
he started shouting.

03:07:04.497 --> 03:07:08.267
I said, “All right, tomorrow we are having
a party, after that I’ll change it.”

03:07:08.468 --> 03:07:12.674
Next day the people came in, they said,
“Oh, what a color, what a color,

03:07:12.875 --> 03:07:17.452
how have you made this color, how did…?”
He started looking at Me.

03:07:17.653 --> 03:07:22.583
I said, “Should I remove it?”
“No, no, no, no, no, it’s very nice.”

03:07:24.737 --> 03:07:29.012
Men care for public opinion very much
and you should see

03:07:29.197 --> 03:07:35.145
that you create a good public opinion
in his presence,

03:07:35.346 --> 03:07:39.281
so that he’ll appreciate you. All these
are tricks, you see?

03:07:39.482 --> 03:07:45.469
I tell you, men are very simple, but you
have to understand them.

03:07:45.670 --> 03:07:48.055
Sometimes they get angry, doesn’t matter.

03:07:48.256 --> 03:07:52.936
Actually, if they are angry with somebody
else, they will come and put it on you.

03:07:53.111 --> 03:07:57.301
It’s better, because if they do anything
to others, they’ll beat them.

03:07:57.501 --> 03:08:00.406
You are not going to beat (them).

03:08:01.484 --> 03:08:06.723
If you understand few things about men,
it can work out.

03:08:06.924 --> 03:08:09.851
Of course, some are very miserable
husbands, I know,

03:08:10.052 --> 03:08:13.825
and some miserable wives – for them we have
divorce allowed

03:08:14.026 --> 03:08:17.835
in our Sahaja Yoga, we have divorce
for them.

03:08:18.036 --> 03:08:21.694
So that is the thing I wanted to tell you,

03:08:21.895 --> 03:08:26.618
that you should make a very good housewife,
a very good Gruha Lakshmi.

03:08:26.819 --> 03:08:33.836
Now, why I am telling you this, that I am
suffering from Gruha Lakshmi’s chakra,

03:08:34.037 --> 03:08:38.511
and all the doctors have told Me it is
because in the collective

03:08:38.719 --> 03:08:46.961
Gruha Lakshmis are not all right, because
they are not good housewives.

03:08:47.162 --> 03:08:52.542
Like I’ll tell you now we have Swiss women.
They are very good, agreed about that,

03:08:52.743 --> 03:08:59.165
but very fond of cleanliness. Swiss are
mad after cleanliness, women, women.

03:08:59.372 --> 03:09:02.855
You can’t talk to them even for five
minutes. If you are sitting there

03:09:03.056 --> 03:09:05.622
they are picking up this, picking up that,
picking up that, picking all the…,

03:09:05.823 --> 03:09:10.896
cleaning, cleaning, cleaning. It’s very
difficult, Swiss women.

03:09:11.097 --> 03:09:13.640
Now, I was… - Eritrea,

03:09:13.841 --> 03:09:19.045
Alga told Me that the women of Eritrea
are known to be Swiss women.

03:09:19.246 --> 03:09:25.856
So, doesn’t matter if the house is little
untidy, if there’s something fallen off.

03:09:26.057 --> 03:09:28.878
In India no woman will do that.

03:09:29.079 --> 03:09:33.438
Now, the guests are sitting and she’s
with the Hoover.

03:09:39.088 --> 03:09:45.066
Like another thing is, like anything
breaks, say,

03:09:45.267 --> 03:09:48.499
supposing the thermometer breaks –
in India they’ll say, “Very good,

03:09:48.700 --> 03:09:52.889
now there will be no temperature,
thermometer’s broken.”

03:09:53.090 --> 03:09:55.988
But I’ve seen in the West, it’s very
surprising,

03:09:56.189 --> 03:10:02.474
supposing some coffee spills, I’m a guest,
immediately they’ll bring the Hoover,

03:10:02.675 --> 03:10:06.066
bring something to clean it –
in the presence of the person.

03:10:06.267 --> 03:10:09.087
Now, if a glass breaks, finished.

03:10:09.288 --> 03:10:13.148
It’s not important. This is a very subtle
type of materialism, I think,

03:10:13.349 --> 03:10:17.159
that the person is sitting there, who is
a guest,

03:10:17.360 --> 03:10:24.505
and why are you trying to do all these
things in her presence or in his presence?

03:10:24.706 --> 03:10:28.759
But this Western women never understand.

03:10:28.960 --> 03:10:34.974
Another thing is, now, you go to an Indian
house. Their color scheme is different.

03:10:35.174 --> 03:10:40.625
If you go to south Indians theirs is
different. Everybody has their own taste.

03:10:40.826 --> 03:10:44.337
As soon as they will enter –
Western women –

03:10:44.538 --> 03:10:48.649
“What a color scheme! What a thing you
have bought! Oh my God, this is horrible.”

03:10:48.850 --> 03:10:53.504
Immediately they will criticize
on the face.

03:10:53.705 --> 03:10:58.905
So another point is that you must always
consider the feelings of others.

03:10:59.106 --> 03:11:07.486
Woman is there to give proper understanding
of feelings of others, what they think.

03:11:07.687 --> 03:11:15.120
Or they go to an Indian house which
will be smelling of their food, “Huh”.

03:11:15.321 --> 03:11:18.534
They’ll eat the same food, they’ll enjoy
the food,

03:11:18.735 --> 03:11:24.542
but they’ll try to show, to show that it is
something lower.

03:11:24.743 --> 03:11:27.396
This is very Western, I must say.

03:11:27.597 --> 03:11:34.436
If somebody is wearing a dress, immediately
they’ll pass a remark.

03:11:34.714 --> 03:11:40.333
Very Western idea. You will not find
good Indians doing that,

03:11:40.534 --> 03:11:44.305
I don’t know about the modern Indians
what sort of things they are.

03:11:44.506 --> 03:11:48.585
But immediately they’ll say things which
will hurt.

03:11:48.786 --> 03:11:52.318
This is not the way a woman should look.

03:11:52.519 --> 03:11:57.229
On the contrary, always praise -
what’s the harm?

03:11:57.430 --> 03:12:03.656
By praising something you are not losing
your business.

03:12:03.857 --> 03:12:11.370
By saying, “What a nice thing, what a nice
sari, what nice clothes” – what’s the harm?

03:12:11.571 --> 03:12:16.200
You’ll enjoy your sweetness, you know?
Really enjoy your sweetness.

03:12:16.401 --> 03:12:20.521
It’s not telling lies, not to be that
honest also necessary.

03:12:20.722 --> 03:12:23.766
Because you don’t like something you must
say, “I don’t like it.”

03:12:23.967 --> 03:12:34.170
This word has to go from Sahaja Yoga.
“I like this and I don’t like that."

03:12:34.371 --> 03:12:41.976
If I, say, saying that, how many will
remain in Sahaja Yoga?

03:12:46.379 --> 03:12:51.582
So it’s very important to drop this
“I like it, I don’t like it.”

03:12:51.767 --> 03:12:54.194
Who are you to like or not like?

03:12:54.395 --> 03:12:59.332
What about your Spirit? What about
your heart?

03:12:59.533 --> 03:13:05.723
So again the same thing comes to,
that women have to have a heart,

03:13:05.932 --> 03:13:13.727
very large heart, beautiful heart.
And your Guru is a Mother,

03:13:13.928 --> 03:13:18.513
so you have to be wonderful mothers
and wonderful wives

03:13:18.714 --> 03:13:23.223
and should have very, very large hearts.

03:13:26.823 --> 03:13:35.434
So that all this selfishness, even this
bank will collapse if you do that.

03:13:35.635 --> 03:13:38.839
It is existing because we have small
hearts.

03:13:39.040 --> 03:13:44.854
If you have large hearts this will
collapse – isn’t it?

03:13:47.371 --> 03:13:52.552
I have said it, especially because I’ve had
many complaints about the women

03:13:52.753 --> 03:13:59.766
who are married here, some Indian women
also. That’s why I’m telling you.

03:13:59.967 --> 03:14:04.823
Best reports are about Russian women
I must say,

03:14:05.024 --> 03:14:08.130
very, very good reports about them.

03:14:08.331 --> 03:14:13.234
They are very satisfied souls, they want
very little, they are not greedy.

03:14:13.435 --> 03:14:16.594
It’s surprising, communism has done
so much good to them.

03:14:16.795 --> 03:14:22.766
It’s not communism, but the extremities
of communism has thrown them

03:14:22.967 --> 03:14:30.565
into that area where they don’t have any
sense of possession, they don’t have.

03:14:30.766 --> 03:14:33.617
Their government said, “All right, you can
have your flats and look after them.”

03:14:33.818 --> 03:14:37.383
Said, “We don’t want to have, you have it.”

03:14:37.951 --> 03:14:40.666
Government servants were told that
“you can have your cars”.

03:14:40.867 --> 03:14:44.553
Said, “No, no, we don’t want, you’d
better have.”

03:14:44.754 --> 03:14:49.545
Because just to own the car is such
a headache – they know.

03:14:49.746 --> 03:14:53.493
Let the government have the headache.
They are not, you know,

03:14:53.694 --> 03:14:57.963
sort of people who are even conscious
of possessiveness.

03:14:58.164 --> 03:15:01.394
Of course, now, they had some funny people.

03:15:01.595 --> 03:15:05.995
I’m forgetting his name, who was finance
minister you had,

03:15:06.227 --> 03:15:12.508
and he was in Geneva, where he learned
all the tricks of the trade

03:15:12.678 --> 03:15:15.822
and he brought forth lots of reforms,
so-called.

03:15:16.023 --> 03:15:21.528
So now Leningrad and Moscow have become
very expensive places –

03:15:21.729 --> 03:15:24.249
thanks to Swiss influence.

03:15:24.450 --> 03:15:29.424
So this has happened there also, but still
the people are very good,

03:15:29.631 --> 03:15:35.108
and the ladies who come from there, even
Romanian girls are very much respected,

03:15:35.309 --> 03:15:39.891
now everybody wants Romanian or Russians,

03:15:45.129 --> 03:15:49.144
or from Kiev. But this time they didn’t
come,

03:15:49.345 --> 03:15:54.670
we are sorry they are not here, I’m missing
them all.

03:15:54.871 --> 03:16:01.772
Lastly, I have to tell you that there’s
a very good book, Arun Apte has written.

03:16:03.088 --> 03:16:06.250
This is the book. You all should buy it.

03:16:06.451 --> 03:16:09.865
I don’t know, what is the price you have
put it?

03:16:10.066 --> 03:16:13.384
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi about
the book and its price]

03:16:35.804 --> 03:16:39.070
Alright. So, those who want to have
this book should apply.

03:16:39.271 --> 03:16:42.851
There are only five, are here,
very good book.

03:16:43.052 --> 03:16:47.901
So, you will understand about Indian music.

03:16:48.102 --> 03:16:54.300
It is said that this music has come
from Omkara.

03:16:54.734 --> 03:17:01.615
And it is very sort of – sensible music.

03:17:01.816 --> 03:17:08.067
Now, I think all those musicians who sang
before Me,

03:17:08.268 --> 03:17:13.004
who were singing western song, was alright.

03:17:13.205 --> 03:17:18.339
But what is missing in that: melody.
It’s not melodious.

03:17:18.540 --> 03:17:21.782
You see, is like little bit you sing,
then you sing this,

03:17:21.983 --> 03:17:25.580
then you shout, then you bring it down,
then do like this.

03:17:25.781 --> 03:17:29.849
And they think that they have to sing
through their heart.

03:17:30.050 --> 03:17:33.497
They have to express the feeling
of their heart.

03:17:33.698 --> 03:17:37.938
Now, supposing somebody is dejected,
so he sings the song of dejection.

03:17:38.139 --> 03:17:42.248
Then another one who is talking about love,
he starts to sing a song.

03:17:42.425 --> 03:17:47.946
He may not be, but artificially they want
to produce that effect.

03:17:48.147 --> 03:17:56.009
There is no need; to sing in parts,
like one word, then one word,

03:17:56.210 --> 03:17:59.846
there’s no melody in it, there’s no flow
in it.

03:18:00.047 --> 03:18:06.446
And, while, Russian songs, though they
were folk songs, were very melodious.

03:18:06.647 --> 03:18:10.816
But don’t worry, Americans are invading
that part also.

03:18:11.017 --> 03:18:13.575
They are having all this horrible music
there.

03:18:13.776 --> 03:18:19.196
Now, the music means, it should please you.
It should give you more entertainment;

03:18:19.397 --> 03:18:23.582
not to make you unhappy, not to make
you sad.

03:18:23.763 --> 03:18:30.905
If you have all these feelings within you,
then you should try to say like this:

03:18:31.073 --> 03:18:35.412
“Yes, there is problem, but I’ll get
over it.”

03:18:35.613 --> 03:18:39.512
Because you are Sahaja Yogis, you have
to show the victory;

03:18:39.713 --> 03:18:42.343
the victorious nature of yours,
in your music.

03:18:42.544 --> 03:18:47.501
I’m not talking about others; they go on
crying, weeping and singing.

03:18:47.701 --> 03:18:52.482
But there is no melody first of all, it is
just part, part, part, part.

03:18:52.707 --> 03:18:56.142
Even the orchestra, which I was surprised:
it all goes like this

03:18:56.343 --> 03:19:00.837
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”, then it goes
“ke, ke, ke, ke, ke”.

03:19:01.038 --> 03:19:10.714
But Indian orchestra, you will see,
is melodious. It flows like a river.

03:19:10.915 --> 03:19:17.359
So, this difference is very bad. So, I would
request all the musicians who are singing,

03:19:17.560 --> 03:19:28.388
the singing doesn’t mean that you use words
which nobody can understand.

03:19:28.589 --> 03:19:33.135
Words must be clear-cut and the melody
must be there.

03:19:33.336 --> 03:19:39.322
Now, in Indian ragas, there is melody
but words are not important.

03:19:39.522 --> 03:19:41.463
So, you enjoy the tune and everything,

03:19:41.664 --> 03:19:45.573
whether you know the language or not,
doesn’t matter.

03:19:45.774 --> 03:19:49.947
So, when you can combine melody
with western music,

03:19:50.148 --> 03:19:53.592
you will see how different it will be.

03:19:55.729 --> 03:19:59.313
And this book will teach you. This is
a very good book,

03:19:59.514 --> 03:20:02.158
which you should have, and which you should
understand

03:20:02.359 --> 03:20:11.594
that how the music can cure you,
music can give you joy,

03:20:11.795 --> 03:20:18.092
what is the basic, the essence of music.
And then you can flower it out.

03:20:18.293 --> 03:20:23.530
I am sure, if Indian musicians take
to western music,

03:20:23.691 --> 03:20:29.734
will be much better than to western music
as it is.

03:20:31.183 --> 03:20:34.812
I can’t understand, these people are
so famous

03:20:35.013 --> 03:20:38.995
and people think they are very well-earning
and all that.

03:20:39.196 --> 03:20:44.590
In America, anybody can earn like that,
but to make it a proper music,

03:20:44.791 --> 03:20:47.539
I think you must have the basis
of Indian music.

03:20:47.740 --> 03:20:51.432
Then you can expand it as you like.

03:20:51.633 --> 03:20:57.757
Now, please try to buy this book,
to understand Indian music.

03:20:57.958 --> 03:21:02.222
There’s no price yet given, but it won’t be
much more than normal,

03:21:02.423 --> 03:21:08.701
so next time, I think for Diwali Puja, they
might bring more. Eh? Ganapatipule.

03:21:08.989 --> 03:21:15.553
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi to know
when the book will be available]

03:21:16.085 --> 03:21:18.424
Accha.

03:21:18.625 --> 03:21:23.392
I will try to get more of these, but this
you must really read,

03:21:23.593 --> 03:21:29.966
because you will know what is the essence
of music, alright?

03:21:30.167 --> 03:21:39.888
And, lastly, today is the 4th day
of Navaratri

03:21:40.315 --> 03:21:48.451
and they have given Me - some of them
are names which are really horrid,

03:21:52.489 --> 03:21:57.392
but they must be people who have suffered
so much

03:21:57.593 --> 03:22:04.682
and they asked Mother to kill those
horrible rakshasas.

03:22:04.883 --> 03:22:13.132
Now in a way, it all will kill in its
natural course, I know that.

03:22:13.333 --> 03:22:20.069
If you people take to sense, because you
are the ones who can do it.

03:22:20.270 --> 03:22:28.590
If you do not try to acquire things which
you don’t want, unnecessary things.

03:22:28.791 --> 03:22:36.857
If you try to reduce all these things
and take to something natural

03:22:37.058 --> 03:22:41.965
and love the Mother Earth, I am sure
it will work out.

03:22:42.140 --> 03:22:46.256
The Mother Earth herself will work it out.

03:22:46.457 --> 03:22:53.081
You know this earthquake. Now nobody
is going in the church.

03:22:53.282 --> 03:22:58.638
But I didn’t do anything. It’s the Mother
Earth.

03:22:59.011 --> 03:23:05.810
Now nobody goes in the church. What -
I didn’t do anything, I would not.

03:23:06.011 --> 03:23:13.587
I was sorry for the art-pieces gone, but
see now how the nature is working out.

03:23:13.788 --> 03:23:20.293
Now Islamic people, these Islamic people
from Indonesia onward,

03:23:20.494 --> 03:23:26.283
all these people are suffering from
the smoke – I didn’t do that.

03:23:26.484 --> 03:23:29.790
Because when you try to do something wrong

03:23:29.991 --> 03:23:34.087
it comes back to you. Action has
a reaction.

03:23:36.769 --> 03:23:41.056
So, your faces should be Sahaj. You should
be Sahaj.

03:23:41.257 --> 03:23:47.141
You shouldn’t look like strained people.
I can’t understand.

03:23:47.342 --> 03:23:53.206
You are Sahaj and be in that Sahaj mood.
I’m sorry I’ve taken so much time,

03:23:53.407 --> 03:23:57.063
but tomorrow I won’t be able to speak
all these things to you.

03:23:57.264 --> 03:24:02.125
And you should try to think about it,
that “Our Mother loves me,

03:24:02.326 --> 03:24:06.510
She wants us to have a good family, She
wants us to look after our children.”

03:24:06.711 --> 03:24:11.649
So, I have advised all the men, as well
as the women.

03:24:11.850 --> 03:24:15.290
It’s better to be hen-pecked, there’s
no harm.

03:24:15.491 --> 03:24:18.978
But hen-pecked doesn’t mean they are
hen-pecked.

03:24:19.179 --> 03:24:24.744
See, they are – just to please your wife,
what’s the harm?

03:24:26.518 --> 03:24:32.592
But that doesn’t mean if she dominates you.
That’s not the thing.

03:24:32.793 --> 03:24:37.137
Like, “Come to my father’s house, I must
go to my mother’s house”.

03:24:37.337 --> 03:24:41.044
All these kind of things you should not
permit.

03:24:41.245 --> 03:24:46.328
But women should also understand,
her family is more important

03:24:46.529 --> 03:24:51.112
than father, mother, even Mataji.

03:24:52.413 --> 03:24:57.342
Because I’ll be only happy to see a happy
family.

03:24:58.282 --> 03:25:00.555
So, thank you very much.
