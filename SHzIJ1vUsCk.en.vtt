00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.260
This was a song composed by Gurudev Rabindranath Tagore

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.220
so many years back, when he had a vision

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.580
of our Ganapatipule seminars.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.420
where he describes that people from all the world will come,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.900
from different countries will come.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:37.440
Also, the Hindus, the Muslims, Christians, Sikhs and all kinds of communities

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.780
will get their awakening on the bank of the sea.

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.700
‘Sagar’, sagar is the sea.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.580
So beautifully every detail he has described.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.100
He was a seer and he could see the future

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.760
where many people, who are seekers, to become ‘mahamanav’ they come.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.720
And it’s very surprising how these seers

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.660
have seen the future.

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.480
Like, as you know, C. S. Lewis is there

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.800
and also, we have got William Blake, so many others.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.220
And I feel today, in Bengal, when I have come here in Calcutta,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.120
that his dreams are fulfilled.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.860
His Spirit would be so happy to know-

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.660
So, as you know that we get all kinds of people, all races,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.120
all religions together in Ganapatipule

00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:46.235
and where you all enjoy the bliss of

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.400
God, where you feel that there’s an awakening.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.235
Also, He says that

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.020
the great Mother has now risen, and She is awakened

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.195
and She is going to awaken you.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.340
So, clearly, he has seen the whole thing.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.700
It’s remarkable how these seers can see things and reveal,

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.880
to our amazement.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.280
I am very happy that we have such nice company

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.040
of Baba Zaheer and his other brothers,

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.480
who are qawwals and his sons also, who are qawwals.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.760
So, this is such a great thing to understand

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.560
that these people have felt the same awakening within them as you have,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.460
and that

00:02:39.055 --> 00:02:41.965
they have really become Sahaja Yogis now

00:02:41.965 --> 00:02:43.760
and they sing from their heart.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.215
Some of these poems, I think, they made later on, after going from Bombay.

00:02:48.215 --> 00:02:51.255
Because I see that they are all new songs.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.360
And, they are singing what you would like to say.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.500
they are singing what you would like to express.

00:03:00.005 --> 00:03:03.195
And that’s why you feel so joyous and happy

00:03:03.195 --> 00:03:06.545
that, "you are saying what we wanted to say all these days".

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.920
It’s remarkable how in the collectivity the thought

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.960
Tongue works in a very different manner

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.215
that we all want to say the same thing.

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.320
For everyone, that is the truth.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.800
And you all feel so joyous about it

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:29.800
and so happy about it.

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:36.260
It is something, a kind of a rapport between one Realized soul and another Realized soul.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:41.120
Only a Realized soul can understand the bliss

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:44.180
and the joy of this expression.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.160
Of course, so many things have been said about Me,

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.280
that’s quite embarrassing. I don’t know what I do.

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.300
I, really, I don’t think I do anything. It's all working out.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.480
It's all grace of the, this All-pervading Power

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.300
which is working out everything so well.

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.860
Today is the concluding day for us

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.240
and to have such a nice program of qawwali here was really remarkable.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.800
I am sorry that half of the people have left

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.200
because they didn’t know there was a program.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:23.780
Today we had to make some arrangements, in that it was lost.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.520
Doesn't matter.

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.360
Those who are lucky have listened to them and have enjoyed them thoroughly.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.400
I bless those qawwals from my heart,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:45.180
and I always think there will be more people

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.640
who will appreciate their music and understand

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.200
and so many Muslims-

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.720
as yesterday, Ilal said, "Mother, when will the Muslims know about You?"

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.720
So, these are the people who can spread the news all over

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:02.200
and can tell that now the time has come of ‘Qiyama’

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.600
where you will have to get your Self-realization.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:08.880
They're very important, I'm so concerned about the Muslims now

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:13.760
Because they are in quite darkness, and the way they are killing people

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.085
because they are Muslims and they are killed in so many places

00:05:18.085 --> 00:05:19.940
while they also kill.

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:22.980
It's a very violent, nonsensical thing,

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.280
which was never preached by Mohammed Sahib.

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:29.220
He was the one who was for love and love and love.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.580
He is the one who had to fight because they were so aggressive on Him.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:36.080
But otherwise,

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.660
if you read Koran, you'll be surprised

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.460
how much He has praised the love of God.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.200
And that’s what is so misleading these days

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.920
that we don’t understand.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:51.840
I am happy at least the Sahaja Yogis understand Koran and understand Mohammed Sahib

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.680
and are in devotion to Mohammed Sahib as they are to any other Guru.

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.280
It’s very creditable for you people to accept.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.660
Because you have seen on your vibrations that Mohammed Sahib was an Incarnation

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.680
of a Master

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:11.760
so you cannot deny it.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.895
And these conditionings have gone into complete negligence now,

00:06:16.895 --> 00:06:19.735
and most of the Sahaja Yogis have such a respect

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.260
for Mohammed Sahib and for Koran.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.580
I wish all the luck to these people

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.075
that they propagate this idea

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.380
and try to bring peace on this earth

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:38.460
by telling people that what Mohammed Sahib has said and what are we doing.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.800
In the same way, for all of us,

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.240
to whatever religion we may belong,

00:06:43.245 --> 00:06:45.645
we have so many conditionings and wrong ideas.

00:06:45.645 --> 00:06:47.705
So, we should try to correct them

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.660
and see for ourselves that

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.260
all of them came to spread spirituality.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:58.060
As I always said, they were like flowers on a tree

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.820
same tree of spirituality they came.

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:04.780
And whatever they had to do at that time, ‘samayachar’, they did it.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.755
But we have plucked the flowers

00:07:07.755 --> 00:07:10.105
and now fighting with the dead flowers.

00:07:11.445 --> 00:07:14.575
So, as Sahaja Yogis, when you are awakened in knowledge,

00:07:14.580 --> 00:07:16.940
and you know what knowledge is,

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:24.040
then you have to really understand that we are all on the same path of spirituality.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:27.360
There’s no difference at all.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.540
May God bless you all for enjoying this qawwali

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:34.820
and for coming all the way to Calcutta.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.060
It has been really a tremendous task, I must say.

00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:50.660
All my thanks are to these great organizers

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.020
who have organized such a big thing in this place.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.040
And we had, yesterday, the whole thing filled up, you see.

00:07:59.460 --> 00:08:04.080
And the way it was conducted and worked out was so remarkable.

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:07.380
All the leaders who came here

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:10.640
were amazed at their organizing capacity.

00:08:10.945 --> 00:08:14.095
And they told Me, “Mother, we have to learn a lot from them.

00:08:14.220 --> 00:08:16.700
We can, of course, not surpass them.

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:21.160
But whatever they have done is such an eye-opener

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.240
that we have to now dedicate ourselves fully

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:28.840
to proper understanding of Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:33.980
its spreading and all the organizing should be our first priority.

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:37.755
Unless and until people take interest in that,

00:08:37.755 --> 00:08:40.985
we cannot achieve what these people have achieved.”

00:08:41.285 --> 00:08:43.875
The collectivity of the

00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.980
Bengali people and Marwaris and all types of people

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:51.920
who are here,

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.780
from every part of our country, is so remarkable.

00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.600
There’s no quarrelling, no discussion, no argument,

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:04.820
it's done so beautifully.

00:09:04.820 --> 00:09:08.020
Unbelievable how they have worked it out!

00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.795
So, we have to remember that we are one

00:09:11.795 --> 00:09:14.455
part and parcel of one being.

00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.800
And once we really realize that,

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.900
we’ll enjoy each other’s company very much.

00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:25.000
All Sahaja Yogis enjoy each other's company.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.680
And also, all of you from the whole world, who have come here

00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.780
have seen how marvelously they have organized everything.

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:38.900
I am thankful to you for coming here to celebrate My birthday

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:40.960
And

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.340
I don't know what to say now,

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:51.440
because every birthday you discover such nice things and such nice people.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.780
This birthday was really remarkable for its all organization

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.800
and the way it was worked out so smoothly.

00:10:01.800 --> 00:10:04.540
I wish we all learn from this.

00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:11.420
We are all thankful to the organization of Calcutta,

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.120
for organizing this so well. Give them a hand.

00:10:20.780 --> 00:10:25.160
I know it's so overwhelming that we cannot even stop clapping.

00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:33.080
Also, we have to again and again thank these qawwals,

00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:44.880
And now the way they feel confident about life,

00:10:45.485 --> 00:10:48.145
as you people all feel confident.

00:10:48.380 --> 00:10:54.500
In the kingdom of God, there's nothing to worry [cut] last, but to enjoy the present.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.660
And that's what they are doing and you were doing too.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:02.140
I enjoyed, I enjoyed the rapport that existed between you.

00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:04.380
Thank you very much. May God bless you.
