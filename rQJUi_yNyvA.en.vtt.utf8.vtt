WEBVTT

00:02.029 --> 00:22.710
[Music]

00:23.949 --> 00:29.300
collectivity doesn't mean that we all

00:26.810 --> 00:32.589
should be stuck together with some glue

00:29.300 --> 00:39.500
or something or we all become like

00:32.589 --> 00:44.539
Gibraltar no it doesn't mean it means

00:39.500 --> 00:47.660
wherever you are you are connected that

00:44.539 --> 00:49.190
is collected but if you are not

00:47.660 --> 00:53.379
connected and you are just glued

00:49.190 --> 00:57.710
together it's very inconvenient to live

00:53.379 --> 00:59.359
under such circumstances I think people

00:57.710 --> 01:04.489
don't even understand the meaning of

00:59.359 --> 01:09.950
collectivity where there's not the other

01:04.489 --> 01:17.020
anon now there's not the other there's

01:09.950 --> 01:20.810
no other personality these personalities

01:17.020 --> 01:26.560
are separated from you because of left

01:20.810 --> 01:26.560
and right or could be both

01:28.810 --> 01:38.110
but you are yourself fully when you are

01:33.369 --> 01:43.350
absolutely detached and your Kundalini

01:38.110 --> 01:43.350
is dancing you are alone and never alone

01:48.750 --> 01:59.700
this oneness with the whole gives you

01:56.120 --> 02:06.420
all the security that you want all the

01:59.700 --> 02:10.789
joy you want and that's why Kundalini

02:06.420 --> 02:10.789
awakening means collectivity

02:11.510 --> 02:19.190
unless and until you want pure

02:15.480 --> 02:22.790
collectivity in your being

02:19.190 --> 02:30.230
Kundalini won't rise

02:22.790 --> 02:39.240
[Music]

02:30.230 --> 02:44.850
so now let us see how do we miss out on

02:39.240 --> 02:50.850
collecting it's a very practical

02:44.850 --> 02:53.070
down-to-earth understanding first we

02:50.850 --> 02:58.530
must know without collectivity we cannot

02:53.070 --> 03:03.090
exist as the body has to be in

02:58.530 --> 03:05.700
connection with a brain in the same way

03:03.090 --> 03:13.350
without collectivity sahaja yoga cannot

03:05.700 --> 03:16.160
exist once you understand that then you

03:13.350 --> 03:19.019
have to work it out that collectivity is

03:16.160 --> 03:24.900
absolutely established within and

03:19.019 --> 03:27.959
without I do not know what thing comes

03:24.900 --> 03:31.620
first in the human mind about another

03:27.959 --> 03:38.239
person but the first thing is that these

03:31.620 --> 03:43.320
are your real relations and nobody else

03:38.239 --> 03:48.570
are your relations these children are

03:43.320 --> 03:50.489
your children and these men are your

03:48.570 --> 03:53.760
brothers and these ladies are your

03:50.489 --> 04:00.570
sisters and we are one big family

03:53.760 --> 04:06.060
together we are part and parcel of one

04:00.570 --> 04:08.900
body as this hand cannot hit another

04:06.060 --> 04:11.370
hand thank God it doesn't think

04:08.900 --> 04:14.450
otherwise as human beings they might

04:11.370 --> 04:17.669
start thinking against another hand but

04:14.450 --> 04:21.269
they don't because they are connected to

04:17.669 --> 04:28.740
one brain activity

04:21.269 --> 04:33.580
[Music]

04:28.740 --> 04:38.020
so you can see that when we ascend in

04:33.580 --> 04:44.380
the collective consciousness and we have

04:38.020 --> 04:46.419
collective living collective meeting at

04:44.380 --> 04:52.870
the wish of the chakra Shri Krishna

04:46.419 --> 05:02.200
established this all he manifested this

04:52.870 --> 05:09.250
pure relationship of a sister in a

05:02.200 --> 05:12.430
collective life that we have in the

05:09.250 --> 05:16.450
ashram where we live where we move about

05:12.430 --> 05:22.630
at sahaja Yogi's if we do not have this

05:16.450 --> 05:25.740
basic principle within us there will be

05:22.630 --> 05:30.130
a can of chaos complete loss

05:25.740 --> 05:34.300
once this purity of relationship is

05:30.130 --> 05:38.669
established that apart from my wife all

05:34.300 --> 05:38.669
the rest are my sisters or mothers

05:43.440 --> 05:46.580
it cannot be

05:50.969 --> 06:04.139
a proper society and the chaos of the

05:58.729 --> 06:10.949
social system of America is because they

06:04.139 --> 06:12.659
have no sense of pure relationships once

06:10.949 --> 06:16.469
you call somebody a sister she's a

06:12.659 --> 06:21.659
sister and once you call somebody a

06:16.469 --> 06:23.189
brother she's a brother it's not only

06:21.659 --> 06:27.029
that you should be born of the same

06:23.189 --> 06:32.099
parents it's not necessary but this is a

06:27.029 --> 06:36.029
very important principle to have a very

06:32.099 --> 06:38.299
pure society where every caddy can live

06:36.029 --> 06:38.299
peacefully

06:38.910 --> 06:51.329
[Music]

06:46.549 --> 06:54.779
think of the tree which is say in a

06:51.329 --> 06:59.149
turmoil or during earthquake it won't

06:54.779 --> 07:02.939
grow when the earthquake stops

06:59.149 --> 07:06.059
everything becomes quiet everything is

07:02.939 --> 07:08.249
peaceful then only the tree can grow in

07:06.059 --> 07:10.769
the same way our growth can only take

07:08.249 --> 07:16.409
place if we are peaceful within

07:10.769 --> 07:19.649
ourselves so for a Kundalini growing

07:16.409 --> 07:20.249
wider and wider and rising higher and

07:19.649 --> 07:23.009
higher

07:20.249 --> 07:27.869
first thing is we must have peace within

07:23.009 --> 07:31.679
ourselves but this peace is possible if

07:27.869 --> 07:34.199
you can make ready peace with others if

07:31.679 --> 07:37.559
you cannot make peace with others who

07:34.199 --> 07:40.709
are in sahaja yoga who are in the

07:37.559 --> 07:44.159
collective if you are in a turmoil this

07:40.709 --> 07:47.149
Kundalini can never rise that is why

07:44.159 --> 07:50.069
collectivity is so important

07:47.149 --> 07:54.479
without collectivity usually cannot

07:50.069 --> 07:57.389
offer and without connectivity you

07:54.479 --> 08:01.739
cannot have the growth of your

07:57.389 --> 08:04.319
spirituality if the growth of the

08:01.739 --> 08:08.399
spirituality as they say the Tree of

08:04.319 --> 08:11.879
Life is upside down and the roots are in

08:08.399 --> 08:17.969
the brain and this Kundalini has to go

08:11.879 --> 08:20.909
and water that brain as we bottle the

08:17.969 --> 08:25.549
roots then it starts flowing downward

08:20.909 --> 08:25.549
and that's how we start expanding

08:25.830 --> 08:34.930
[Music]

08:32.849 --> 08:37.089
now mother has said we have to have

08:34.930 --> 08:39.130
compassion when away do you have our

08:37.089 --> 08:42.159
compassion on the walls where do we use

08:39.130 --> 08:45.670
our compassion where do we use our

08:42.159 --> 08:47.410
compassion so Sergio guys to be

08:45.670 --> 08:50.770
practiced doesn't mean that you sit down

08:47.410 --> 08:53.279
with my photograph all the time doesn't

08:50.770 --> 09:01.540
mean that it means you practice

08:53.279 --> 09:03.760
compassion you practice that then you

09:01.540 --> 09:06.850
have to practice love now how do you

09:03.760 --> 09:09.880
practice love with others if you love

09:06.850 --> 09:15.880
someone what do you do you try to please

09:09.880 --> 09:18.279
that was small things can make people

09:15.880 --> 09:20.650
very happy I know you all try to please

09:18.279 --> 09:22.420
me very much and give me presents you'll

09:20.650 --> 09:25.089
find out things which are good for me

09:22.420 --> 09:27.550
you go out of the way bye sweet flowers

09:25.089 --> 09:31.930
for me beautiful things you do to please

09:27.550 --> 09:36.250
me I am over priest I am sorry but I am

09:31.930 --> 09:38.709
more pleased much more pleased if you

09:36.250 --> 09:41.950
understand collectivity and try to

09:38.709 --> 09:45.459
please each other so now the practice

09:41.950 --> 09:50.320
love where you practice I ask you a

09:45.459 --> 09:55.089
question where do I practice love what

09:50.320 --> 09:57.790
do I love believe love our house we love

09:55.089 --> 10:01.270
our photographs of decorations

09:57.790 --> 10:07.390
everything but do I practice this love

10:01.270 --> 10:10.020
on my wife or my husband or another

10:07.390 --> 10:10.020
sahaja Yogi's

10:10.400 --> 10:20.520
[Music]

10:17.390 --> 10:28.680
in our search culture we have to

10:20.520 --> 10:33.450
practice compassion and love and thirdly

10:28.680 --> 10:35.940
we have to practice patience I know some

10:33.450 --> 10:38.510
children are maybe little more

10:35.940 --> 10:41.490
mischievous some are less mischievous

10:38.510 --> 10:43.410
maybe some people are very talkative

10:41.490 --> 10:44.510
sometimes really they gave me also a

10:43.410 --> 10:46.590
headache

10:44.510 --> 10:50.550
they go on talking talking talking

10:46.590 --> 10:54.530
talking so much sometimes I think it's

10:50.550 --> 10:54.530
good because it's a rest for my mouth

10:55.130 --> 10:59.880
one way of looking at it another way of

10:58.500 --> 11:01.590
looking of it is just switch off your

10:59.880 --> 11:06.150
mind let him talk take it out whatever

11:01.590 --> 11:10.910
you want once he is finished with it in

11:06.150 --> 11:13.500
fact out then he won't bother you much

11:10.910 --> 11:17.160
and also it feels satisfied that

11:13.500 --> 11:19.620
somebody has listened to his practice so

11:17.160 --> 11:24.570
patience is needed and patience is

11:19.620 --> 11:27.720
needed in such a way that others should

11:24.570 --> 11:29.610
see your patience yesterday for example

11:27.720 --> 11:31.680
I was sitting for about I think three

11:29.610 --> 11:37.650
hours shaking hands with all sorts of

11:31.680 --> 11:40.860
people and all types of problems and the

11:37.650 --> 11:45.290
person who came last he said looking at

11:40.860 --> 11:45.290
your patience I develop my own patience

11:45.350 --> 11:56.760
and love gives you patience this love

11:53.120 --> 12:01.020
nourishes you I am Telling You it

11:56.760 --> 12:02.880
substituted down-to-earth method here I

12:01.020 --> 12:06.140
have not mentioned that you trust God

12:02.880 --> 12:08.370
I'm just saying trust yourself

12:06.140 --> 12:11.540
absolutely down to earth because we are

12:08.370 --> 12:11.540
talking about your brain

12:11.840 --> 12:23.749
[Music]

12:18.850 --> 12:27.589
so today's understanding should be that

12:23.749 --> 12:29.079
we all should become collective from

12:27.589 --> 12:33.670
itself

12:29.079 --> 12:38.689
we should not grudge or grumble about

12:33.670 --> 12:42.079
and enjoy the collectivity but the

12:38.689 --> 12:45.230
second sight of collectivity is this

12:42.079 --> 12:47.360
that do not try to exploit the

12:45.230 --> 12:50.209
collectivity otherwise we'll be in

12:47.360 --> 12:53.449
trouble like I've seen some people don't

12:50.209 --> 12:58.579
know how to use their bathrooms when you

12:53.449 --> 13:04.429
are collective you have to be respecting

12:58.579 --> 13:07.189
the collectivity of others by your

13:04.429 --> 13:12.619
presence another person should not by

13:07.189 --> 13:21.110
any chance suffer or should not feel in

13:12.619 --> 13:26.209
any way insulted or inconvenient

13:21.110 --> 13:27.970
inconvenienced so when you are in the

13:26.209 --> 13:31.749
collective it should be such that

13:27.970 --> 13:38.179
another person should enjoy your company

13:31.749 --> 13:47.629
enjoy your being there that's something

13:38.179 --> 13:49.790
where there is no problem but if you are

13:47.629 --> 13:52.370
demanding and if you are asking for

13:49.790 --> 13:55.429
things and you think no end of yourself

13:52.370 --> 14:01.399
you cannot collect you by any chance but

13:55.429 --> 14:06.769
you will suffer for them automatically

14:01.399 --> 14:12.999
you'll suffer if this is realized and

14:06.769 --> 14:12.999
understood properly your are guess all

14:13.510 --> 14:30.259
[Music]

14:20.589 --> 14:37.790
like anger people always boast I'm very

14:30.259 --> 14:42.110
angry with you boast but just make that

14:37.790 --> 14:44.619
anger into forgiveness and you see the

14:42.110 --> 14:49.399
person you serve you getting into

14:44.619 --> 14:51.489
problems he will get into problems anger

14:49.399 --> 14:55.029
will upset you

14:51.489 --> 14:57.100
but forgiveness will upset him

14:55.029 --> 15:00.439
automatically

14:57.100 --> 15:04.309
it's the biggest weapon you have God is

15:00.439 --> 15:10.730
to forgive and this is shown in buddha's

15:04.309 --> 15:13.299
character throughout now we have been

15:10.730 --> 15:18.499
saying that we have to forgive everyone

15:13.299 --> 15:21.829
but we don't practice that small small

15:18.499 --> 15:23.720
things like mad people we remember only

15:21.829 --> 15:26.329
only I ever had heard that snake has

15:23.720 --> 15:28.939
this capacity to remember if somebody

15:26.329 --> 15:31.119
has hurt him but here I find human

15:28.939 --> 15:34.100
beings have no less combatants

15:31.119 --> 15:35.869
whatever has happened 13 years back 15

15:34.100 --> 15:38.540
years back they all remember each and

15:35.869 --> 15:40.699
everything whatever has hurt them but

15:38.540 --> 15:43.670
how they have hurt others they don't

15:40.699 --> 15:46.970
remember how they have been nasty to

15:43.670 --> 15:52.069
others they are no no because this is a

15:46.970 --> 15:53.600
human mind which has got the ego it can

15:52.069 --> 15:57.949
go on hurting others it doesn't feel

15:53.600 --> 16:00.049
anything and the super-ego which goes on

15:57.949 --> 16:03.069
receiving all the hurts and always pray

16:00.049 --> 16:03.069
complaining about

16:03.430 --> 16:14.559
[Music]

16:10.799 --> 16:17.529
don't criticize the collectivity till I

16:14.559 --> 16:22.949
myself find it out and I'll put it right

16:17.529 --> 16:25.689
keep to the collectivity wisely and

16:22.949 --> 16:32.230
arresting and try to keep the

16:25.689 --> 16:34.779
collectivity together try to help to

16:32.230 --> 16:35.410
keep the people collective to enjoy

16:34.779 --> 16:39.639
together

16:35.410 --> 16:42.129
don't criticize each other only

16:39.639 --> 16:44.439
criticize yourself if you lie if you are

16:42.129 --> 16:47.199
in the habit of criticism better

16:44.439 --> 16:50.829
criticize yourself is better because

16:47.199 --> 16:53.019
these are habits also people especially

16:50.829 --> 16:55.660
I have seen people in the West they

16:53.019 --> 16:58.389
react to everything if they see this

16:55.660 --> 17:00.249
cover-up I don't like it but this is not

16:58.389 --> 17:01.929
yours you are not paid for you what have

17:00.249 --> 17:04.740
you got to do with it now I don't like

17:01.929 --> 17:07.089
it it's not yours

17:04.740 --> 17:10.419
what's the question it's lying here and

17:07.089 --> 17:14.730
why should you be so upset what I don't

17:10.419 --> 17:24.519
like that person I don't like that dress

17:14.730 --> 17:25.299
who are you I don't like this is not

17:24.519 --> 17:32.950
allowed inside

17:25.299 --> 17:35.769
I don't like there is the way of saying

17:32.950 --> 17:39.029
things but there is no need to say

17:35.769 --> 17:39.029
anything whatsoever

17:44.030 --> 17:52.150
so all of these kind of bumptious nests

17:46.340 --> 17:52.150
and showing off is against collectivity

17:52.880 --> 18:02.860
[Music]

18:00.039 --> 18:04.760
so try to appreciate everything

18:02.860 --> 18:10.490
children are producing pictures

18:04.760 --> 18:13.400
paintings enemy they make sometimes my

18:10.490 --> 18:14.659
face is very funny when they draw not

18:13.400 --> 18:17.480
the children even grown-ups

18:14.659 --> 18:20.690
then what I appreciate is very good

18:17.480 --> 18:24.950
wonderful very nice to encourage that

18:20.690 --> 18:26.809
person so criticism should go out of our

18:24.950 --> 18:31.549
mind but appreciation should be

18:26.809 --> 18:36.380
practiced appreciation of others

18:31.549 --> 18:38.780
children appreciation of other people is

18:36.380 --> 18:42.250
very important but that doesn't mean

18:38.780 --> 18:44.419
that you appreciate all others and

18:42.250 --> 18:47.289
torture your wife or tortured your

18:44.419 --> 18:51.140
husband that also is an environment

18:47.289 --> 18:54.830
first responsibility is your family but

18:51.140 --> 18:57.260
you should appreciate others and this

18:54.830 --> 19:00.559
comes when you have no jealousies about

18:57.260 --> 19:01.280
anyone this jealousy I don't know from

19:00.559 --> 19:03.830
where it comes

19:01.280 --> 19:08.419
I don't know this quality of jealousy

19:03.830 --> 19:10.640
why there is jealousy so also if you

19:08.419 --> 19:13.640
have jealousy you have to use it for the

19:10.640 --> 19:15.919
right purpose and what is the right

19:13.640 --> 19:18.140
purpose is that you should be jealous of

19:15.919 --> 19:21.260
a person who is spiritually higher than

19:18.140 --> 19:24.409
you and you practice it that you become

19:21.260 --> 19:27.200
better if jealousy is for competition

19:24.409 --> 19:32.020
then you compete with a person who is

19:27.200 --> 19:38.630
more compassionate more loving more

19:32.020 --> 19:40.760
sacrificing more patient so this

19:38.630 --> 19:43.820
competition becomes a very healthy

19:40.760 --> 19:46.570
competition and the collectivity becomes

19:43.820 --> 19:46.570
very nourished

19:47.070 --> 19:58.049
[Music]

19:54.210 --> 20:01.419
the worst enemy of collectivities

19:58.049 --> 20:04.480
aggressiveness some people are basically

20:01.419 --> 20:07.359
addressing their style of talking is

20:04.480 --> 20:09.970
extremely aggressive the way they say

20:07.359 --> 20:13.470
things is ex aggressive maybe because

20:09.970 --> 20:16.090
anything maybe they are better educated

20:13.470 --> 20:20.080
maybe they come from a very aggressive

20:16.090 --> 20:24.249
family maybe they are are having a kind

20:20.080 --> 20:26.669
of air superiority complex or an inside

20:24.249 --> 20:31.509
or too complex or a sense of insecurity

20:26.669 --> 20:34.590
or maybe they are possessed they try to

20:31.509 --> 20:41.759
dominate and show their very strong

20:34.590 --> 20:44.950
feelings towards people of superiority

20:41.759 --> 20:49.179
they may be inferior it's not necessary

20:44.950 --> 20:52.830
but they took and this is something is

20:49.179 --> 20:58.679
to be curved so what you have to

20:52.830 --> 20:58.679
practice here is humility try to be able

20:58.889 --> 21:06.519
humility is that in no way you try to

21:04.239 --> 21:09.970
address others and if others are

21:06.519 --> 21:12.669
aggressive you accept it as a childish

21:09.970 --> 21:16.720
thing as a stupid thing as a foolish

21:12.669 --> 21:20.799
thing has no meaning because you are so

21:16.720 --> 21:23.169
powerful you can bear it that is

21:20.799 --> 21:30.070
humility which you have to practice and

21:23.169 --> 21:33.340
all these qualities if you have you will

21:30.070 --> 21:36.059
really be surprised that you would lose

21:33.340 --> 21:36.059
your selfishness

21:36.550 --> 21:47.150
[Music]

21:43.750 --> 21:50.630
only way to grow is to be collective

21:47.150 --> 21:54.200
there's no other way out if people think

21:50.630 --> 21:56.720
that by staying away from ashrams alone

21:54.200 --> 22:01.540
living somewhere they will achieve much

21:56.720 --> 22:01.540
that's not the way sahaja Yoga is meant

22:01.990 --> 22:10.040
formerly people used to go to Himalayas

22:04.580 --> 22:13.670
and most of them were separate it and

22:10.040 --> 22:17.660
only one or two persons were chosen for

22:13.670 --> 22:21.400
spiritual growth here it is not question

22:17.660 --> 22:26.660
of spiritual growth is the question of

22:21.400 --> 22:29.870
your collectivity growing in you that is

22:26.660 --> 22:34.070
how you become a person who is

22:29.870 --> 22:36.920
collective who enjoys collective who

22:34.070 --> 22:42.590
works on collective and lives with

22:36.920 --> 22:52.660
collective such a person develops new

22:42.590 --> 22:55.970
kind of powers and these powers are such

22:52.660 --> 23:02.960
that they are very subtle but they

22:55.970 --> 23:06.830
penetrate into any molecule atom or

23:02.960 --> 23:10.250
human beings anywhere and their

23:06.830 --> 23:13.750
penetration is only possible if you have

23:10.250 --> 23:16.700
a temperament which is collective

23:13.750 --> 23:23.990
without being fully collective you

23:16.700 --> 23:28.059
cannot achieve that height which is very

23:23.990 --> 23:28.059
necessary today for sahaja yoga

23:29.040 --> 23:37.210
[Music]

23:46.380 --> 23:52.990
integration is not there that's why you

23:49.240 --> 23:54.580
have to attend collective you know you

23:52.990 --> 23:57.130
have to become more collective the body

23:54.580 --> 23:58.990
has to be collective the thing is if you

23:57.130 --> 24:01.030
don't if you are not a collective person

23:58.990 --> 24:02.620
then sometimes you'll kill them on the

24:01.030 --> 24:04.870
leg sometimes on the heart sometimes in

24:02.620 --> 24:06.700
the head that's not a good thing you

24:04.870 --> 24:09.070
should try to become more collective

24:06.700 --> 24:13.600
should meet more people take more

24:09.070 --> 24:17.620
interest you see the body of yours won't

24:13.600 --> 24:23.020
work out efficiently unless and until

24:17.620 --> 24:27.250
you use it because individually you see

24:23.020 --> 24:31.510
if they individually if you work up it

24:27.250 --> 24:34.090
will not develop collectively because

24:31.510 --> 24:37.120
where are you using it you are

24:34.090 --> 24:39.160
correcting yourself to give it to others

24:37.120 --> 24:42.730
and if you don't give it if you do not

24:39.160 --> 24:45.660
work it out in a collective way there's

24:42.730 --> 24:45.660
no circulation

24:46.350 --> 24:56.630
[Music]

24:53.650 --> 25:01.190
meditating together is the best way to

24:56.630 --> 25:02.750
feed the connectivity you can meditate

25:01.190 --> 25:05.060
at home of course you are suppressing

25:02.750 --> 25:07.130
for your depth but also you must

25:05.060 --> 25:11.710
meditate together and when you meditate

25:07.130 --> 25:14.930
together then the strength that you have

25:11.710 --> 25:17.440
strengthens others and the strength of

25:14.930 --> 25:20.390
the whole collectivity improves so much

25:17.440 --> 25:24.080
we are meditating together is a very big

25:20.390 --> 25:26.660
thing everyone has to understand that

25:24.080 --> 25:28.640
whenever you get time you find out in

25:26.660 --> 25:31.580
the morning times for example we'll go

25:28.640 --> 25:33.740
to the ashram and meditate say Sunday

25:31.580 --> 25:35.960
morning will just want me to take in the

25:33.740 --> 25:38.870
ashram just for meditation you have to

25:35.960 --> 25:42.860
come meditate and go away because I

25:38.870 --> 25:45.610
reside in this ashram I'm here so leave

25:42.860 --> 25:48.770
your homes come here and meditate

25:45.610 --> 25:52.460
meditation will help you a lot wherever

25:48.770 --> 25:54.920
you are together and with it but when

25:52.460 --> 25:59.510
you are away from each other I am NOT

25:54.920 --> 26:01.760
with you only in difficulties when you

25:59.510 --> 26:04.760
are pushed into some places where I am

26:01.760 --> 26:09.110
not that where you think I'm not there I

26:04.760 --> 26:11.900
am there but if you deliberately are

26:09.110 --> 26:14.150
keeping out of collectivity and not with

26:11.900 --> 26:17.150
you so try to grow your collectivity

26:14.150 --> 26:21.110
otherwise you cannot go deep into your

26:17.150 --> 26:24.830
own depths you cannot become a great

26:21.110 --> 26:27.770
sahaja yogi you cannot really be called

26:24.830 --> 26:32.110
as such those who have a sense of

26:27.770 --> 26:32.110
collectivity can only become that

26:32.430 --> 26:43.920
[Music]

26:39.800 --> 26:50.179
sangham sharanam gachami Sangha means

26:43.920 --> 26:54.780
collectivity I surrender myself to the

26:50.179 --> 26:57.120
collected so here in complete awareness

26:54.780 --> 26:58.590
I mean you cannot be mesmerized

26:57.120 --> 27:02.460
if you are mesmerized then you can do

26:58.590 --> 27:05.850
whatever way you like but in complete

27:02.460 --> 27:12.950
awareness and full understanding we have

27:05.850 --> 27:15.570
to become collective but once you are

27:12.950 --> 27:20.250
without ego means you have surrendered

27:15.570 --> 27:22.730
yourself no one can cheat you can you

27:20.250 --> 27:22.730
understand that

27:24.110 --> 27:34.850
no one can cheat you because there is

27:30.990 --> 27:38.580
some higher force which is looking after

27:34.850 --> 27:43.590
this is the way we should understand

27:38.580 --> 27:47.760
Buddha this is we should know our Buddha

27:43.590 --> 27:50.610
qualities this is how our ego can be

27:47.760 --> 27:54.630
dissolved when you say mother is

27:50.610 --> 27:59.630
surrender to you that just means that

27:54.630 --> 28:06.480
you give this horrible ego a complete

27:59.630 --> 28:15.260
holiday it means that that is how this

28:06.480 --> 28:18.350
ego disappears I think all your just now

28:15.260 --> 28:22.830
raga eyes are open out most of you

28:18.350 --> 28:28.650
somehow and then you would laugh at

28:22.830 --> 28:31.820
everything you make fun of yourself just

28:28.650 --> 28:31.820
enjoy everything

28:31.950 --> 28:42.710
[Music]

28:38.859 --> 28:46.609
last but not the least one must

28:42.710 --> 28:49.580
understand that as all the seven chakras

28:46.609 --> 28:55.099
I am working on are in a collective way

28:49.580 --> 28:58.219
held by me my Murata the quality of

28:55.099 --> 29:02.960
Virata gana is that that she creates

28:58.219 --> 29:10.369
this universal awareness within us the

29:02.960 --> 29:13.700
collectivity and if you do not realize

29:10.369 --> 29:19.450
that in modern times we are in a

29:13.700 --> 29:19.450
spiritual part in a collective way only

29:22.659 --> 29:30.159
this is what it is because we have

29:25.789 --> 29:35.210
reached to the state of Salaam and here

29:30.159 --> 29:40.219
we have to have a collective working

29:35.210 --> 29:43.009
only there's no other way out this is

29:40.219 --> 29:48.169
the most important point we must know if

29:43.009 --> 29:50.659
he cannot be collective because of

29:48.169 --> 29:52.849
anything jealousy maybe inferiority

29:50.659 --> 29:55.159
complex maybe any anything which is

29:52.849 --> 29:58.789
coming from behind like a worm crawling

29:55.159 --> 30:00.320
up then know that something wrong with

29:58.789 --> 30:05.719
you nothing wrong with the collectivity

30:00.320 --> 30:10.159
I hope you can understand my vision and

30:05.719 --> 30:14.299
in stand by me come up to that I depend

30:10.159 --> 30:15.950
on you entirely for my vision we have to

30:14.299 --> 30:20.599
change this whole world into a beautiful

30:15.950 --> 30:22.940
place for that not my sacrifice is

30:20.599 --> 30:26.119
needed they are already blessed you

30:22.940 --> 30:33.070
don't have to do much only thing is keep

30:26.119 --> 30:33.070
your attention on the source of power

30:40.630 --> 30:46.870
thank you but the essays we promise we

30:44.179 --> 30:46.870
all say that

30:58.170 --> 31:01.190
thank you very much
