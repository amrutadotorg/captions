00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:13.083
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:27.076
As you know, that you all have been seeking before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:31.253 --> 00:00:46.480
You went to different places, read lots of books, and also some of you were lost.

00:00:47.353 --> 00:00:54.321
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know what you were seeking.

00:00:56.575 --> 00:01:02.700
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:07.778
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

00:01:07.858 --> 00:01:10.844
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

00:01:10.924 --> 00:01:17.655
This is one point which is absolutely there in every religion, “Know thyself” –

00:01:17.735 --> 00:01:23.693
because without knowing yourself you will not know God.

00:01:23.773 --> 00:01:26.288
You will not know spirituality.

00:01:26.368 --> 00:01:30.796
So the first step was to know yourself,

00:01:30.876 --> 00:01:36.969
and that one people did all kinds of tricks with you, they taught you in a different ways

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:43.955
and tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

00:01:44.035 --> 00:01:46.950
All those things have happened, is finished.

00:01:47.885 --> 00:01:55.113
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get your Self-realization.

00:01:56.352 --> 00:02:08.324
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization is to know God, or the Goddess;

00:02:09.728 --> 00:02:14.987
that is the purpose of Self-realization.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:23.231
But after getting Self-realization, what should happen to you?

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:32.499
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical things like drugs and all those things;

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:38.291
you have lost interest in reading also useless books; you have lost interest

00:02:38.371 --> 00:02:43.784
in other habits like drinking and all that.

00:02:43.864 --> 00:02:47.864
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

00:02:47.944 --> 00:02:51.321
That would happen in anyway.

00:02:52.352 --> 00:02:58.841
What has to happen by knowing God, is that why does God wants you to know Him?

00:02:58.921 --> 00:03:04.222
Because He wants to see His reflection in you.

00:03:04.302 --> 00:03:08.584
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why He has created you,

00:03:08.664 --> 00:03:11.882
and He wants to see His reflection in you.

00:03:11.962 --> 00:03:14.258
Same with the Goddess.

00:03:14.338 --> 00:03:22.922
She has given you Self-realization because She wants to see Her reflection in you.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:31.938
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,

00:03:32.018 --> 00:03:49.698
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving, compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:59.572
So this is the point one has to reach, where you understand you have to have wisdom.

00:04:00.245 --> 00:04:07.821
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are not a self-realized person.

00:04:07.901 --> 00:04:17.855
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He wants you to become one part and parcel of the Virata

00:04:20.222 --> 00:04:28.981
or the Viratangana, also wants the same thing, that you should become part and parcel of the Virata.

00:04:29.061 --> 00:04:34.118
Not because you are realized souls now, so you go about thinking

00:04:34.198 --> 00:04:40.683
you are perfectly alright, you don’t have to do anything about it.

00:04:40.763 --> 00:04:46.544
What do you do beyond this is the point,

00:04:46.624 --> 00:04:57.377
that after Self-realization you have to see the reflection that should be within you

00:04:57.457 --> 00:05:03.783
from the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

00:05:03.863 --> 00:05:14.412
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult situation, as you know,

00:05:14.492 --> 00:05:22.782
and He was carried from there to Gokul, where He was brought up by Yeshoda.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:31.605
Now there He started His playfulness.

00:05:31.685 --> 00:05:38.751
So you have to be playful in life, you have to create fun and joy.

00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:46.847
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old sage somewhere in the Himalayas,

00:05:46.927 --> 00:05:54.493
but you mix up with children, you talk to them, you play with them, have fun.

00:05:54.573 --> 00:06:01.864
At the same time He was destroying negative forces which acted upon Him.

00:06:01.944 --> 00:06:07.405
In His playfulness only He has done it, as a child only He has done it.

00:06:07.485 --> 00:06:12.487
How matured He was as a child you can see, that He killed the Putana,

00:06:12.567 --> 00:06:18.899
and there are two horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:23.830
At the same time He was playing with the gopis

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:30.007
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them.

00:06:31.432 --> 00:06:39.232
Why? Because He wanted them to be playful;

00:06:39.312 --> 00:06:43.552
and all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

00:06:43.632 --> 00:06:52.891
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted the complete mountain on His fingertips.

00:06:52.971 --> 00:06:59.142
That time these people should have understood, it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

00:06:59.222 --> 00:07:06.864
But He was just standing there with the one finger at the mountain

00:07:06.944 --> 00:07:10.945
in a very simple, unassuming manner;

00:07:11.025 --> 00:07:18.443
He was doing all that to protect all the boys who were playing with Him.

00:07:18.523 --> 00:07:28.330
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who was a big snake in the water.

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:36.203
In the water this horrible fellow was creating venom, and by which many people were killed.

00:07:36.283 --> 00:07:49.874
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

00:07:49.954 --> 00:07:59.573
in a way all the people by killing or hitting, or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

00:07:59.653 --> 00:08:04.685
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked Him

00:08:04.765 --> 00:08:10.263
that “Please forgive him,” and He forgave.

00:08:10.343 --> 00:08:18.673
All these things show a child of six, seven years doing all these great things

00:08:18.753 --> 00:08:26.675
without feeling what He was doing, we can say that without even thinking about it.

00:08:26.755 --> 00:08:33.158
But He achieved it, because He was aware that He was Shri Krishna.

00:08:33.238 --> 00:08:39.347
So first thing, you have to be aware that you are self-realized people.

00:08:39.427 --> 00:08:45.876
You are not ordinary people to behave in an ordinary way,

00:08:45.956 --> 00:08:56.474
you are special people made specially to reflect the qualities of God Almighty.

00:08:56.554 --> 00:09:01.216
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

00:09:01.296 --> 00:09:09.760
But the situation is such today that you are all the time protected.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:12.044
You are all the time protected.

00:09:12.124 --> 00:09:17.313
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,

00:09:17.393 --> 00:09:24.342
and you can be looked after because you are Sahaja yogis.

00:09:27.802 --> 00:09:32.325
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja yogi

00:09:32.405 --> 00:09:38.652
towards taking decisions, one should understand.

00:09:40.305 --> 00:09:45.719
It should be a spontaneous decision.

00:09:45.799 --> 00:09:54.099
You don’t have to tally it with this, go there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

00:09:54.179 --> 00:09:58.777
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

00:09:58.857 --> 00:10:05.044
So in the same way you should have a very spontaneous decision for anything.

00:10:05.124 --> 00:10:07.182
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

00:10:07.886 --> 00:10:08.886
All right.

00:10:09.292 --> 00:10:14.471
You go in the shop and immediately you should know which is the one.

00:10:14.551 --> 00:10:23.919
In every walk of life you should have a very spontaneous decision, instant decision.

00:10:23.999 --> 00:10:28.181
But what I find, the style is very different.

00:10:28.261 --> 00:10:36.088
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make a list of it, then make all the measurements,

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:41.548
then go home and say that “We’ll decide it tomorrow.”

00:10:42.223 --> 00:10:45.979
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

00:10:46.059 --> 00:10:53.444
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely spontaneously, at that moment.

00:10:54.719 --> 00:11:00.752
You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned,

00:11:00.832 --> 00:11:05.898
so the first impulse should be that you have to save.

00:11:05.978 --> 00:11:11.165
And how do you save? You jump in the water

00:11:11.245 --> 00:11:16.653
because you are protected, nothing can happen to you,

00:11:16.733 --> 00:11:21.158
so just jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

00:11:21.238 --> 00:11:26.873
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude, this should be your temperament,

00:11:26.953 --> 00:11:31.458
that you take a very spontaneous decision.

00:11:33.405 --> 00:11:40.115
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,

00:11:40.195 --> 00:11:46.496
and having a big conference for decisions and all that – not needed.

00:11:46.576 --> 00:11:55.529
In day-to-day life also you have to be like that.

00:11:55.609 --> 00:12:03.551
Also in every political life, economic life or any other life you have to lead, you have

00:12:03.631 --> 00:12:09.032
to be very spontaneous.

00:12:09.599 --> 00:12:13.939
How do you become spontaneous?

00:12:14.019 --> 00:12:17.004
What quality you have got?

00:12:17.084 --> 00:12:24.146
What is the weapon you have got, to know what decision to take?

00:12:24.226 --> 00:12:25.898
Do you know?

00:12:25.978 --> 00:12:32.072
You have got vibrations, you have the feel of the vibrations,

00:12:32.152 --> 00:12:35.769
and you know what vibrations are.

00:12:35.849 --> 00:12:41.288
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey and communicate to you.

00:12:41.368 --> 00:12:43.728
They speak to you.

00:12:43.808 --> 00:12:53.759
So through your vibrations you should know in a second what should you do.

00:12:53.839 --> 00:13:00.697
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother, when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

00:13:00.777 --> 00:13:02.244
It’s a fact.

00:13:02.324 --> 00:13:05.557
But how many of you feel that way?

00:13:05.637 --> 00:13:10.709
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

00:13:10.789 --> 00:13:15.298
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

00:13:15.378 --> 00:13:24.110
You should know looking at anyone, sitting next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

00:13:24.190 --> 00:13:30.542
you should know what sort of vibrations that person has.

00:13:30.622 --> 00:13:33.656
This kind of sensitivity if you develop,

00:13:33.736 --> 00:13:39.806
then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision.

00:13:39.886 --> 00:13:42.329
You know I am very good at it.

00:13:42.409 --> 00:13:49.998
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really five minutes.

00:13:50.078 --> 00:13:55.608
When I came here they said, “You can’t go up, because You have big car.”

00:13:55.688 --> 00:13:59.399
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along, I’ll take You in my car.”

00:13:59.479 --> 00:14:04.201
So I went with him on the car, on that car, and I saw it.

00:14:04.281 --> 00:14:06.778
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

00:14:06.858 --> 00:14:17.108
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right, and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

00:14:17.188 --> 00:14:24.338
And everybody who was with Me, they said, “Ah, what a place, Mother! You can’t buy that.”

00:14:24.635 --> 00:14:27.528
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

00:14:27.609 --> 00:14:28.683
“When?”

00:14:28.764 --> 00:14:30.702
“Today. Now!”

00:14:30.938 --> 00:14:33.170
He was amazed.

00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:36.500
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:39.221
He said, “Very easy. In this Italy

00:14:39.301 --> 00:14:45.393
You have to buy like this, that You pay one-third of the price, all right?

00:14:45.473 --> 00:14:47.764
And then You can occupy.

00:14:47.844 --> 00:14:54.497
If You find something wrong with the place You can give up, but then You’ll not get Your money.

00:14:54.578 --> 00:14:58.558
But if the other fellow who is selling You says no, then he has to pay double.”

00:14:58.638 --> 00:15:00.801
I said, “Very good bargain.

00:15:00.881 --> 00:15:05.327
I am buying. I have told you I am buying. I’ll buy.”

00:15:05.407 --> 00:15:09.575
And everybody was surprised what Mother was doing.

00:15:09.655 --> 00:15:13.768
So what decided was the vibrations.

00:15:13.848 --> 00:15:17.762
Vibrations of the place just decided. I said, “Buy it.”

00:15:17.842 --> 00:15:23.759
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles; I said no.

00:15:23.839 --> 00:15:30.256
Outside only I could say no, and they were surprised I didn’t even go inside.

00:15:30.336 --> 00:15:32.239
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

00:15:32.319 --> 00:15:36.895
They said, “Nunnery.” I said, “See?”

00:15:36.975 --> 00:15:43.051
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous decision.

00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:55.053
Then you will be amazed how in such a short time you can really achieve such great things.

00:15:57.796 --> 00:16:02.097
But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way;

00:16:02.177 --> 00:16:06.157
first you should have that sensitivity of vibrations.

00:16:06.237 --> 00:16:09.049
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:13.275
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja Yoga.

00:16:13.355 --> 00:16:16.728
So the maturity has to be brought in.

00:16:16.808 --> 00:16:23.722
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right, I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

00:16:23.802 --> 00:16:28.902
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

00:16:30.095 --> 00:16:33.267
So now, how do you know?

00:16:33.347 --> 00:16:37.133
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,

00:16:37.213 --> 00:16:44.380
you find that you have got nothing, it’s all nonsense – possible.

00:16:44.817 --> 00:16:49.857
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,

00:16:49.937 --> 00:16:56.783
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if they are wrong,

00:16:56.863 --> 00:17:02.263
if there are some mistakes or that will make you suffer,

00:17:02.343 --> 00:17:06.544
whether economically, politically, in every way,

00:17:06.624 --> 00:17:14.574
then your whole value system will be judged very well

00:17:14.654 --> 00:17:26.582
how far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far you have achieved your Self-realization,

00:17:26.662 --> 00:17:29.383
and where are you.

00:17:32.852 --> 00:17:36.510
This is what is the way to test yourself.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:43.646
You should not be afraid of failures, and not get enamored by success,

00:17:43.726 --> 00:17:46.738
because you are self-realized souls.

00:17:46.818 --> 00:17:53.352
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately you will know what is it.

00:17:54.198 --> 00:17:57.160
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that

00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:02.636
you could have the same as I have, but you should try it.

00:18:03.145 --> 00:18:08.943
Now, I have seen some people will praise some man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

00:18:09.023 --> 00:18:10.951
You must meet him.

00:18:11.031 --> 00:18:20.676
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such a help, and this will happen and that will happen.”

00:18:20.756 --> 00:18:24.883
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

00:18:24.963 --> 00:18:29.204
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet him.”

00:18:29.284 --> 00:18:34.011
They can’t understand. “Such a great man, he’ll be a minister tomorrow.”

00:18:34.091 --> 00:18:36.163
“I don’t want to meet him.”

00:18:38.722 --> 00:18:40.822
And you find immediately,

00:18:40.902 --> 00:18:50.144
just next day, a big report about him in the newspaper that he’s a very bad man.

00:18:50.224 --> 00:18:54.577
So you must tally your experience

00:18:54.657 --> 00:19:01.035
and your understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

00:19:01.115 --> 00:19:06.195
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous decisions.

00:19:06.275 --> 00:19:12.768
Don’t think about it how it should work out, what should we do.

00:19:12.848 --> 00:19:26.213
It has a very far-fetched influence on your mind also that you see,

00:19:26.293 --> 00:19:30.503
that you know what is right and what is wrong.

00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:35.754
I don’t know how many of you have seen the house I have built.

00:19:35.834 --> 00:19:42.613
The another side of Shri Krishna was that He was extremely creative.

00:19:42.693 --> 00:19:47.478
In His childhood He did all these things, these pranks,

00:19:47.558 --> 00:19:56.435
and when He became a grown-up person He became the king of Dwarika, of that area.

00:19:56.930 --> 00:20:02.444
And He used to dress up like a king only – after all, He was a king.

00:20:02.524 --> 00:20:12.518
When He was a child He used to wear a small little piece of a feather from the peacock,

00:20:12.598 --> 00:20:16.894
but when He became the king He was wearing all the things,

00:20:16.974 --> 00:20:23.164
and He used to sit on the throne and talk to people in that manner.

00:20:23.752 --> 00:20:29.337
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely creative.

00:20:29.417 --> 00:20:39.438
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

00:20:39.518 --> 00:20:43.559
out of gold – can you believe it?

00:20:43.639 --> 00:20:45.956
Shri Krishna did it.

00:20:46.036 --> 00:20:49.127
And it was all then covered with water.

00:20:49.207 --> 00:20:54.410
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained by Western people I think,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:21:02.980
said that it’s not possible, there’s nothing in the water and He never built His palace there;

00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:10.238
it’s all a story just, just like a myth.

00:21:10.318 --> 00:21:14.528
But some people believed in it, and they dug up.

00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:19.402
They went down and they found there was a very big palace.

00:21:19.482 --> 00:21:24.640
There was gold little bit left, but not all of it was there.

00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:30.775
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace He had made.

00:21:30.855 --> 00:21:36.346
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

00:21:36.426 --> 00:21:44.327
Like this, all these incarnations who came were extremely creative.

00:21:44.407 --> 00:21:49.127
If you are not creative, what’s the use of Self-realization?

00:21:49.644 --> 00:21:55.463
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you can do very easily

00:21:55.543 --> 00:21:59.516
is to make others Sahaja yogis.

00:21:59.986 --> 00:22:09.818
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing, is to make others Sahaja yogis

00:22:09.898 --> 00:22:20.938
and give them the blessings of the Divine, which they have been seeking for ages.

00:22:21.018 --> 00:22:28.359
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace, what a blessing you give.

00:22:28.439 --> 00:22:35.891
So now when you have got your Self-realization – you got it very easily, I must say; they

00:22:35.971 --> 00:22:45.975
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true,

00:22:46.055 --> 00:22:53.670
but whatever you get so easily and instantly, you don’t understand the value of that.

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:59.146
They always say for India that they got their freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that easily,

00:22:59.226 --> 00:23:01.314
that’s why they do not value it.

00:23:01.394 --> 00:23:11.772
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly and without any special effort,

00:23:11.852 --> 00:23:15.804
then you don’t value it, you don’t understand.

00:23:15.884 --> 00:23:18.260
You think it’s a matter of right.

00:23:18.340 --> 00:23:23.653
But do you know how much people have suffered for getting Self-realization?

00:23:23.733 --> 00:23:32.798
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on one leg, sometimes on their heads for months together,

00:23:32.878 --> 00:23:35.711
and they didn’t get realization.

00:23:35.791 --> 00:23:47.052
I have heard of some people who lived in a room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

00:23:47.132 --> 00:23:49.201
And why they lived like that?

00:23:49.281 --> 00:23:55.806
Because they thought by keeping away from other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

00:23:55.886 --> 00:24:01.684
they might get realization. They never got it.

00:24:01.764 --> 00:24:05.772
So one must understand, though you have got it very easily,

00:24:05.852 --> 00:24:12.780
it’s something so precious, so great.

00:24:14.927 --> 00:24:19.784
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

00:24:21.988 --> 00:24:28.316
You read about the people who are self-realized.

00:24:28.396 --> 00:24:34.194
Perhaps they did not even know how they got it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

00:24:34.274 --> 00:24:39.390
but they got it, through their guru maybe, maybe their efforts.

00:24:39.470 --> 00:24:46.529
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He gets His realization.

00:24:46.609 --> 00:24:51.760
Think of Him, how He got His realization.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:25:00.752
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately dies of hunger and poverty.

00:25:00.832 --> 00:25:03.983
But nothing happened to you.

00:25:04.063 --> 00:25:11.176
You have got it without any difficulties, in a very sweet manner, all of you.

00:25:11.256 --> 00:25:15.374
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t have to do anything about it.

00:25:15.454 --> 00:25:23.001
But that doesn’t mean you should not value it.

00:25:23.081 --> 00:25:32.135
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth spontaneously sprouts

00:25:32.215 --> 00:25:45.193
and gives life to the primule which grows, can grow into a shrub and then into a tree.

00:25:45.273 --> 00:25:54.971
But you have to put water in, and you have to have the care of a gardener or someone.

00:25:55.051 --> 00:26:00.458
In your case, you are the one who has to do all that.

00:26:00.538 --> 00:26:10.628
First of all you have to put the nourishment of compassion and love.

00:26:11.481 --> 00:26:15.658
Have you got that compassion and love?

00:26:16.114 --> 00:26:19.636
Do you love people?

00:26:19.716 --> 00:26:23.817
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked – “I don’t like children.”

00:26:23.897 --> 00:26:29.849
I said, “You don’t like children?” “No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:35.591
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

00:26:35.671 --> 00:26:41.416
How can you say such a thing, you don’t like your own children, anything?

00:26:41.496 --> 00:26:44.805
First of all, for all of you I would say

00:26:44.885 --> 00:26:49.539
that you should never say “I like” and “I don’t like.”

00:26:49.619 --> 00:26:52.346
These are anti-mantras.

00:26:52.426 --> 00:26:57.096
“I like this” – it’s very common. Who are you?

00:26:57.176 --> 00:27:02.597
“I don’t like this carpet. I don’t like that silver thing.”

00:27:02.677 --> 00:27:06.765
Who are you? Can you make one like that?

00:27:08.568 --> 00:27:12.054
To take a decision of that kind is also shows

00:27:12.134 --> 00:27:16.035
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s not.

00:27:16.115 --> 00:27:19.362
It has come from your conditioning,

00:27:19.442 --> 00:27:24.252
that you think you have a right to say “I don’t like, I don’t want.”

00:27:24.332 --> 00:27:27.070
But who are you?

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:35.173
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these words, because it might hurt somebody.

00:27:35.253 --> 00:27:41.047
You’ll never say something that will hurt others, you’ll never do anything

00:27:41.127 --> 00:27:45.553
that will be dangerous for others;

00:27:45.633 --> 00:27:48.600
but always you’ll say something

00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:56.296
that would be extremely loving and compassionate, and peace-giving.

00:27:56.376 --> 00:28:01.608
You will emit joy for others.

00:28:01.688 --> 00:28:09.140
There is the power of spirit, that it gives joy to others.

00:28:09.220 --> 00:28:14.901
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then you are not self-realized.

00:28:14.981 --> 00:28:21.279
You should be able to give joy and love and compassion,

00:28:21.359 --> 00:28:27.549
and it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:41.090
There’s a story about a saint in India, in Maharashtra.

00:28:41.170 --> 00:28:48.694
So they all used to take water in a container called as kanwar,

00:28:48.774 --> 00:28:55.683
and would take it all the way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

00:28:55.763 --> 00:29:03.104
That was regarded as a great, you can say, surrendering to Shri Krishna.

00:29:03.184 --> 00:29:10.091
So that saint also carried water in that container, this kanwar.

00:29:11.016 --> 00:29:17.815
All the way he carried it from his village in Maharashtra,

00:29:17.895 --> 00:29:23.495
and when he reached the temple, at the foot of that temple

00:29:23.575 --> 00:29:33.589
he saw a donkey very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

00:29:33.669 --> 00:29:39.912
So he gave that water to that donkey.

00:29:39.992 --> 00:29:46.140
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this water for miles together, for days together

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:54.072
to be put on the deity here, and now you have given it to this donkey.”

00:29:54.152 --> 00:30:02.069
He said, “You don’t know, God has come all the way down here to take the water.”

00:30:02.149 --> 00:30:06.092
See the attitude that he took.

00:30:07.547 --> 00:30:16.818
So for a self-realized person the compassion should be like that, of very generous nature.

00:30:16.898 --> 00:30:26.564
If you are not generous, if you are miserly, always worried about your money and saving of it,

00:30:26.644 --> 00:30:32.883
then firstly you are not a matured Sahaja yogi – you are not.

00:30:32.963 --> 00:30:39.384
Apart from that, this kind of money will never give you any happiness.

00:30:39.464 --> 00:30:42.717
Miserliness is against spirit.

00:30:42.797 --> 00:30:48.997
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

00:30:49.077 --> 00:30:59.163
It never strives to save something, or cheat people or steal something

00:30:59.243 --> 00:31:02.687
– is out of question;

00:31:02.767 --> 00:31:09.007
because there is no greed left in it, there is no greed at all.

00:31:09.087 --> 00:31:16.737
And that is why such a person who is a realized soul cannot be greedy,

00:31:17.366 --> 00:31:20.292
has to be extremely generous.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:26.453
I have seen many people like that who have been extremely generous,

00:31:26.533 --> 00:31:34.561
and who have been very understanding about the problems of others.

00:31:34.641 --> 00:31:40.091
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems, he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

00:31:40.171 --> 00:31:47.880
He is there to solve the problems of others, and not to solve his own problems

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:51.401
and go about talking about it, “This is the problem I have.”

00:31:51.481 --> 00:31:54.521
Now this is a new word that has developed in modern times.

00:31:54.602 --> 00:31:57.658
They never used to use the word “problem” before, I tell you;

00:31:57.738 --> 00:32:01.753
only for geometry we used this word “problem.”

00:32:01.833 --> 00:32:04.923
But now it has started with a … “There’s no problem.”

00:32:07.219 --> 00:32:11.399
They are all in a problem, actually they are problems, I think.

00:32:11.479 --> 00:32:18.374
So what you have to do is to understand that you should not give your problems to others.

00:32:18.454 --> 00:32:25.374
You should not ask for anything, “Please do this for me, please do that for me.”

00:32:26.707 --> 00:32:35.369
It’s very surprising that people try to sort of take advantage of others.

00:32:38.020 --> 00:32:43.147
Now some people like to visit some countries, so they will ask you, “Please call me.

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:45.910
I would love to come to your country,”

00:32:45.990 --> 00:32:51.160
and a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right, come along.”

00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.474
Now, who is failing here is the person who asked.

00:32:55.554 --> 00:33:02.929
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever, because you are complete.

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:12.230
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete. What can anybody give you?

00:33:12.310 --> 00:33:16.650
All desires just disappear when you are in complete shape.

00:33:16.730 --> 00:33:20.661
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars had come out.

00:33:20.741 --> 00:33:25.561
I said, “As soon as the moon will come, they’ll all disappear.”

00:33:26.313 --> 00:33:31.962
In the same way, when you are complete,

00:33:33.989 --> 00:33:38.985
you do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

00:33:39.065 --> 00:33:44.529
On the contrary, you want to find out what you can do for others.

00:33:44.609 --> 00:33:48.078
You become the others, in a way that whatever

00:33:48.158 --> 00:33:51.478
is the problem of others you take upon yourhead.

00:33:53.204 --> 00:33:55.272
You jump into it.

00:33:57.437 --> 00:34:03.848
It’s a very, very interesting growth that should come in you.

00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:13.400
It should happen to all of you, because you have got your Self-realization.

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:21.010
You develop a kind of a personality which only lives for others, not for oneself.

00:34:21.811 --> 00:34:26.537
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere, you can sleep anywhere.

00:34:26.617 --> 00:34:31.267
You can have food, you need not have food, whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

00:34:31.807 --> 00:34:35.007
because you are so satisfied.

00:34:36.614 --> 00:34:44.624
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for others, give them food, do whatever you like

00:34:46.104 --> 00:34:49.024
possible, you try to do.

00:34:51.376 --> 00:34:57.425
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

00:34:57.505 --> 00:35:02.190
But there are people who have only their own problems.

00:35:02.270 --> 00:35:03.933
They are not Sahaja yogis.

00:35:04.013 --> 00:35:08.615
How can the spirit have problems?

00:35:11.803 --> 00:35:14.572
How can that happen?

00:35:16.084 --> 00:35:24.304
So just understand that you are now the spirit, and beyond everything.

00:35:25.467 --> 00:35:31.265
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

00:35:31.727 --> 00:35:36.045
Of course you start giving realization to people.

00:35:36.125 --> 00:35:38.847
You create art.

00:35:38.927 --> 00:35:44.713
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature and he was – well,

00:35:44.793 --> 00:35:46.830
he didn’t know any language.

00:35:46.910 --> 00:35:51.309
He was very good for mathematics, because My mother was a mathematician,

00:35:51.389 --> 00:35:53.580
but language he did not know.

00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:57.031
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

00:35:57.111 --> 00:36:03.246
But after realization he wrote such beautiful poems. Unbelievable!

00:36:03.326 --> 00:36:08.787
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that, because he didn’t know any language well.

00:36:08.867 --> 00:36:12.363
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

00:36:12.443 --> 00:36:21.883
So, amazingly, from where he started writing Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

00:36:22.497 --> 00:36:27.215
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do you get this Urdu poetry?”

00:36:27.295 --> 00:36:31.014
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

00:36:31.499 --> 00:36:35.687
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells me.”

00:36:35.767 --> 00:36:43.855
So the creativity within you is just flowers,

00:36:43.935 --> 00:36:49.877
and you are amazed at yourself, how this creativity has come in.

00:36:49.957 --> 00:36:57.962
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician becoming suddenly a poet

00:36:58.042 --> 00:37:02.837
– I mean, it’s impossible situation.

00:37:02.917 --> 00:37:06.104
And you have these capacities.

00:37:06.184 --> 00:37:10.967
You have all these capacities that you can become very creative,

00:37:11.047 --> 00:37:16.271
and you have to be creative in every way.

00:37:16.351 --> 00:37:23.018
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the time working out something

00:37:23.098 --> 00:37:26.247
which comes out very well.

00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:32.523
And also I don’t have that interest as normally people have,

00:37:32.603 --> 00:37:38.777
that it should be praised by everyone or it should be, sort of,

00:37:38.857 --> 00:37:42.316
very much in the newspapers and everything.

00:37:42.396 --> 00:37:44.962
No, no interest.

00:37:45.042 --> 00:37:52.255
You create for creation, for the sake of creation you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

00:37:52.335 --> 00:38:01.226
And you become very adaptable, or you become so congenial

00:38:01.306 --> 00:38:09.328
with all the things people say, talk – all right, let them do it.

00:38:09.408 --> 00:38:20.856
They will be offensive, or they could be also praising you … you don’t know that they are praising you.

00:38:20.936 --> 00:38:23.920
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki Jai!”

00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:30.290
– I also say, and then I forget they are talking about Me.

00:38:31.707 --> 00:38:40.315
Somehow you are above all that, and you are there, and you just don’t understand

00:38:40.395 --> 00:38:47.296
why human beings behave like that, why their behavior is so funny.

00:38:47.376 --> 00:38:54.574
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they have a great desire to be leaders,

00:38:54.654 --> 00:39:04.045
or they have a great desire to be a great organizer of Sahaja Yoga,

00:39:04.125 --> 00:39:06.868
to be very well-known in Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:06.948 --> 00:39:17.084
They want to have an international fame as a great Sahaja yogi.

00:39:17.164 --> 00:39:23.604
But they do not think that “What creativity I have shown?

00:39:23.684 --> 00:39:26.361
What have I created?”

00:39:26.441 --> 00:39:30.605
Just all these things are so common in human beings

00:39:30.685 --> 00:39:42.408
that they always want others to praise them, to have a very big sort of a exposure – of what?

00:39:44.487 --> 00:39:48.780
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:56.291
What is there to expose, what is there to show off, what is there to come forward?

00:39:56.371 --> 00:40:03.142
Even if you are at the back there is light, you know there is light.

00:40:03.222 --> 00:40:11.354
So you have to get out of your darkness, because you are the light and you spread light;

00:40:11.434 --> 00:40:19.339
instead of if you are in the darkness, what light can you spread?

00:40:19.419 --> 00:40:25.114
So your spirit cannot have problems.

00:40:25.194 --> 00:40:28.317
It has no fear.

00:40:28.397 --> 00:40:36.812
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom, and that wisdom is the one sign

00:40:36.892 --> 00:40:41.949
of you being a very higher personality.

00:40:42.029 --> 00:40:51.134
As I told you, this is evolution, and when you are transformed you are evolved.

00:40:51.214 --> 00:41:00.257
Of a very different nature you become, and you are to stand out.

00:41:00.337 --> 00:41:07.594
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

00:41:07.674 --> 00:41:11.830
What was Christ? He was a son of a carpenter.

00:41:11.910 --> 00:41:15.346
He never got education.

00:41:16.637 --> 00:41:19.487
But what did He do?

00:41:21.034 --> 00:41:24.194
He was the Spirit.

00:41:25.196 --> 00:41:37.646
He reflected God within Him, and that’s why He got Himself crucified also.

00:41:39.809 --> 00:41:42.902
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get crucified,

00:41:42.982 --> 00:41:46.857
there are all not such testing things for you,

00:41:46.937 --> 00:41:52.320
but your value system is to be checked.

00:41:52.400 --> 00:42:00.603
You must find out how are you working out, through introspection.

00:42:01.849 --> 00:42:09.451
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr. Sahaja yogi, how are you?

00:42:11.157 --> 00:42:14.223
Are you indulging into all these things

00:42:14.303 --> 00:42:19.625
that these people who are not self-realized are doing?”

00:42:19.705 --> 00:42:25.360
Just try to find out, because the growth of Sahaja Yoga

00:42:25.440 --> 00:42:34.701
is shown in your behavior, in your styles, on your face.

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:42.389
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,

00:42:42.469 --> 00:42:48.707
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how will you get wrinkles?

00:42:48.787 --> 00:42:54.620
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

00:42:54.700 --> 00:43:00.684
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

00:43:02.504 --> 00:43:11.540
Once in a church there was in Switzerland, one lady came to hit Me with a Bible,

00:43:11.620 --> 00:43:13.601
and I started laughing. I said,

00:43:13.681 --> 00:43:17.654
“What a thing, and I have to be hit by a Bible!” you see.

00:43:17.734 --> 00:43:23.023
And she got such a fright that I was laughing, and I was saying,

00:43:23.103 --> 00:43:27.593
“Look at this stupidity of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

00:43:28.263 --> 00:43:34.343
I mean, I can understand stone or anything else, but Bible will never hit Me.

00:43:36.977 --> 00:43:43.920
All these things have happened in your presence, and you know about it.

00:43:52.264 --> 00:43:55.937
There are negative forces. They try to harm you.

00:43:56.017 --> 00:44:01.467
They will harm you bodily, they will harm you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

00:44:01.547 --> 00:44:09.358
But when you are above this, then no one harms you.

00:44:09.438 --> 00:44:14.887
At least you never feel the harm, you are not bothered about the harm.

00:44:14.967 --> 00:44:18.318
But what have you created?

00:44:18.398 --> 00:44:25.042
Today I had some ladies and some men, and all for divorce.

00:44:25.122 --> 00:44:31.970
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they want to have divorces, can you imagine?

00:44:32.050 --> 00:44:34.810
I was shocked.

00:44:34.890 --> 00:44:38.881
And they had funny ideas that “my husband is like my brother.”

00:44:38.961 --> 00:44:41.400
I said, “Really?”

00:44:41.480 --> 00:44:45.150
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their heads

00:44:45.230 --> 00:44:48.977
means there’s no light of the spirit in them.

00:44:49.057 --> 00:44:57.539
If you have light of the spirit, then your understanding is very different.

00:44:57.619 --> 00:45:02.141
You don’t worry about yourself, you only worry about others,

00:45:02.221 --> 00:45:07.129
and you try to find out solutions for them.

00:45:07.209 --> 00:45:10.319
You try to help them.

00:45:11.787 --> 00:45:17.407
It is very easy for you.

00:45:17.487 --> 00:45:20.924
What is so easy for the light to burn?

00:45:21.004 --> 00:45:24.811
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

00:45:24.891 --> 00:45:27.861
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

00:45:27.941 --> 00:45:33.386
But for human beings, I can’t understand, even after realization,

00:45:33.466 --> 00:45:36.289
after growing for years together

00:45:36.369 --> 00:45:45.506
they are still so stupid that they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

00:45:45.586 --> 00:45:53.600
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill it.

00:45:54.727 --> 00:45:57.574
It cannot blow off.

00:45:57.654 --> 00:46:02.919
This light will go off, but the light of the spirit won’t go off.

00:46:02.999 --> 00:46:12.409
But what is the oil that keeps it there is your compassion, is love, care of others.

00:46:12.489 --> 00:46:17.451
I know there are people who are very, say, dominating, may be troublesome, what else

00:46:17.531 --> 00:46:19.442
– but care for them.

00:46:19.522 --> 00:46:23.020
Know that they are not like you, they are not complete,

00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.431
they have problems; so you care for them.

00:46:26.511 --> 00:46:30.637
But instead of that, you start thinking that “Why should I care for him?

00:46:30.717 --> 00:46:36.054
How does he care for me?” or something. Then you are finished.

00:46:37.036 --> 00:46:43.362
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

00:46:43.442 --> 00:46:48.362
A spiritual person’s reactions are very, very different.

00:46:49.110 --> 00:46:52.329
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:57.035
that He had a friend who was very poor,

00:46:57.115 --> 00:47:01.356
and he wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

00:47:01.436 --> 00:47:09.047
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice crispies, as you call them,

00:47:09.127 --> 00:47:13.625
“And that’s, take for your friend. You must take something for your friend.”

00:47:13.705 --> 00:47:19.015
He was a little shy, you know. And when he went to Shri Krishna,

00:47:19.095 --> 00:47:22.513
Shri Krishna was in His palace,

00:47:22.593 --> 00:47:26.170
and the people at the door said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:33.068
He said, “All right. You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

00:47:33.768 --> 00:47:40.032
He was sitting on the throne discussing something, and He said, “Sudama has come!”

00:47:40.112 --> 00:47:52.059
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged him, hugged him again and again;

00:47:52.139 --> 00:47:57.340
and He said, “Why are you standing here?”

00:47:57.420 --> 00:48:06.181
He took him and put him on the throne that He was supposed to,

00:48:06.261 --> 00:48:11.465
and He told His wives, “Please come and wash his feet.”

00:48:11.545 --> 00:48:14.647
And then they brought for him clothes and all that.

00:48:14.727 --> 00:48:21.730
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed.

00:48:21.810 --> 00:48:24.798
See the love of Shri Krishna.

00:48:24.878 --> 00:48:30.584
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

00:48:30.664 --> 00:48:37.138
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine by which it would be all right.

00:48:37.218 --> 00:48:43.270
He tried to do whatever was possible to him to cure those cracks.

00:48:43.350 --> 00:48:47.675
And He asked him to sleep on His bed,

00:48:47.755 --> 00:48:54.451
and asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t feel hot.

00:48:54.531 --> 00:49:02.481
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows so beautifully.

00:49:04.455 --> 00:49:07.164
Are we that compassionate?

00:49:09.745 --> 00:49:16.394
There was no need for Him to do that; it was no drama, nothing – but His heart!

00:49:18.185 --> 00:49:20.333
He took a spontaneous decision.

00:49:20.413 --> 00:49:24.873
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed there.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:30.688
He just felt so happy that “My old friend has come.”

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:49.867
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son,

00:49:49.947 --> 00:49:54.353
he asked Him that “Why don’t You come and stay in my palace?”

00:49:55.159 --> 00:50:04.082
He said, “All right, I can come, but you see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

00:50:04.162 --> 00:50:09.689
Vidur was a son of a maid.

00:50:10.835 --> 00:50:14.599
He went and had His food with Vidur.

00:50:14.679 --> 00:50:23.096
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know what food he must have given Him,

00:50:23.176 --> 00:50:27.256
while Duryodhan would have given Him such sumptuous food.

00:50:27.336 --> 00:50:35.015
So for such people, taste and the level of food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the love,

00:50:35.095 --> 00:50:43.395
the respect of Vidur, who was a realized soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

00:50:43.475 --> 00:50:49.894
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is a governor,

00:50:49.974 --> 00:50:56.859
I can’t understand; the spirit is above everything else

00:50:56.939 --> 00:51:02.535
and does not respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something wrong with him.

00:51:02.615 --> 00:51:07.702
He should understand that this spiritual person is higher than all these people

00:51:07.782 --> 00:51:17.037
who have these, all kinds of these big names behind them.

00:51:17.117 --> 00:51:22.177
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:

00:51:22.257 --> 00:51:29.808
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

00:51:29.888 --> 00:51:34.841
had that love which was above everything else,

00:51:34.921 --> 00:51:44.210
without expecting anything, not doing it just to expect something from them.

00:51:44.290 --> 00:51:54.877
It is a kind of a personality which really reflects God’s love.

00:51:54.957 --> 00:51:58.948
That reflection should come from you.

00:51:59.028 --> 00:52:06.724
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean that you are something higher than others,

00:52:07.234 --> 00:52:11.577
but you are different. You are above them.

00:52:11.657 --> 00:52:15.431
You have no superiority, that’s why you are different.

00:52:15.511 --> 00:52:19.053
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

00:52:19.133 --> 00:52:25.855
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s why you are humble.

00:52:26.617 --> 00:52:32.174
There are so many things I can tell you from the life of Shri Krishna,

00:52:32.254 --> 00:52:38.969
showing He was, they call Him Yogeshwara.

00:52:39.049 --> 00:52:48.506
He was a Lord of Yoga. It is because He was Virat.

00:52:48.586 --> 00:53:01.716
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna, to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

00:53:02.299 --> 00:53:06.594
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

00:53:06.674 --> 00:53:15.369
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy He was living in Gokul,

00:53:15.449 --> 00:53:19.894
and He never showed off His powers.

00:53:21.523 --> 00:53:30.084
His powers were within Himself, which were expressing spontaneously.

00:53:31.337 --> 00:53:38.277
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete discretion.

00:53:38.357 --> 00:53:47.138
If it does not have then this is not divine power, this is some satanic power:

00:53:47.218 --> 00:53:55.695
because somebody is nice to you if you are nice to that person, nothing doing.

00:53:56.210 --> 00:54:05.507
Mostly we had in India people who were called as avadhutas.

00:54:05.587 --> 00:54:14.397
They were the realized souls who had gone away from the society, from the multitudes,

00:54:14.810 --> 00:54:24.805
and gone and lived in some small little place or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

00:54:24.885 --> 00:54:31.971
because they thought nobody is going to understand them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

00:54:32.051 --> 00:54:38.774
They were singled out, one person here and one person there.

00:54:38.854 --> 00:54:41.134
What could they do?

00:54:41.214 --> 00:54:45.938
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja yogis together.

00:54:46.018 --> 00:54:50.567
You have so many friends and you have so many others with you.

00:54:50.647 --> 00:54:56.771
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves from the society.

00:54:56.851 --> 00:55:03.212
They would not meet people, because if they tried anything they would be crucified.

00:55:03.292 --> 00:55:08.950
But not you people, because you have a society.

00:55:09.030 --> 00:55:17.873
You have a beautiful enlightened society of very good friends,

00:55:17.953 --> 00:55:24.466
of very good spiritual people.

00:55:24.546 --> 00:55:32.391
With all this if you cannot create, then what should I say?

00:55:32.471 --> 00:55:43.418
You have to create something: may be art, may be music, may be poetry,

00:55:43.498 --> 00:55:50.654
may be literature, may be writing – whatever it is, you have to create.

00:55:50.734 --> 00:55:54.883
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

00:55:55.596 --> 00:55:59.271
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

00:55:59.351 --> 00:56:07.147
That’s the main thing you have to have, is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

00:56:07.227 --> 00:56:13.816
And there I can go to places, can have programs, do everything.

00:56:13.896 --> 00:56:21.431
But you have to show with your own example that this is something great,

00:56:21.511 --> 00:56:29.154
how they have achieved this state; we should achieve also that state.

00:56:29.234 --> 00:56:41.191
So you will be the ones who will really inspire them, who will really make them follow you

00:56:41.271 --> 00:56:45.614
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

00:56:45.694 --> 00:56:54.725
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become complete – and you have to become.

00:56:54.805 --> 00:57:04.200
Nothing is more important than becoming a Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,
