00:02.510 --> 00:13.083
Today we are here to worship Shri Krishna within us.

00:18.185 --> 00:27.076
As you know, that you all have been seeking
before coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:31.253 --> 00:46.480
You went to different places, read lots of
books, and also some of you were lost.

00:47.353 --> 00:54.321
And in that seeking, perhaps you did not know
what you were seeking.

00:56.575 --> 01:02.700
What you were seeking was to know yourself.

01:03.203 --> 01:07.675
In all religions it is said “Know thyself.”

01:07.858 --> 01:10.686
It’s a common thing all of them have said.

01:10.924 --> 01:17.654
This is one point which is absolutely there
in every religion, “Know thyself” –

01:17.821 --> 01:23.580
because without knowing yourself you will not know God.

01:23.773 --> 01:26.226
You will not know spirituality.

01:26.368 --> 01:30.583
So the first step was to know yourself,

01:30.876 --> 01:36.942
and that one people did all kinds of tricks with you,
they taught you in a different ways

01:37.149 --> 01:43.984
and tried to actually loot you and cheat you.

01:44.135 --> 01:47.050
All those things have happened, is finished.

01:47.333 --> 01:55.213
So then you come to Sahaja Yoga and you get
your Self-realization.

01:55.836 --> 02:08.424
Well, what is the purpose of Self-realization
is to know God, or the Goddess;

02:08.782 --> 02:14.041
that is the purpose of Self-realization.

02:15.215 --> 02:22.499
But after getting Self-realization, what should
happen to you?

02:23.412 --> 02:31.096
Many of you have lost interest in nonsensical
things like drugs and all those things;

02:31.323 --> 02:38.970
you have lost interest in reading also useless
books; you have lost interest

02:38.995 --> 02:42.562
in other habits like drinking and all that.

02:42.877 --> 02:46.992
But that’s not enough, that’s not enough.

02:46.992 --> 02:51.274
That would happen in anyway.

02:51.502 --> 02:57.989
What has to happen by knowing God, is that
why does God wants you to know Him?

02:58.071 --> 03:03.221
Because He wants to see His reflection in you.

03:03.452 --> 03:09.653
He wants to see His reflection, that’s why
He has created you, and He wants to see His

03:09.653 --> 03:10.933
reflection in you.

03:10.933 --> 03:12.722
Same with the Goddess.

03:12.722 --> 03:23.922
She has given you Self-realization because
She wants to see Her reflection in you.

03:23.922 --> 03:41.772
So you have to prepare yourself for that reflection,
which is so much purer, beautiful, loving,

03:41.772 --> 03:50.912
compassionate and above all, full of wisdom.

03:50.912 --> 03:58.722
So this is the point one has to reach, where
you understand you have to have wisdom.

03:58.722 --> 04:06.632
If you are lacking in wisdom then you are
not a self-realized person.

04:07.793 --> 04:17.103
At the level of Shri Krishna, you see, He
wants you to become one part and parcel of

04:17.103 --> 04:24.543
the Virata – or the Viratangana, also wants
the same thing, that you should become part

04:24.543 --> 04:29.293
and parcel of the Virata.

04:29.293 --> 04:35.463
Not because you are realized souls now, so
you go about thinking you are perfectly all

04:35.463 --> 04:39.913
right, you don’t have to do anything about
it.

04:39.913 --> 04:50.733
What do you do beyond this is the point, that
after Self-realization you have to see the

04:50.733 --> 05:03.874
reflection that should be within you from
the lives of these people like Shri Krishna.

05:03.874 --> 05:15.683
Shri Krishna was first born in a very difficult
situation, as you know, and He was carried

05:15.683 --> 05:22.013
from there to Gokul, where He was brought
up by Yeshoda.

05:22.013 --> 05:30.663
Now there He started His playfulness.

05:30.663 --> 05:38.243
So you have to be playful in life, you have
to create fun and joy.

05:38.243 --> 05:47.323
He didn’t say that you sit down like a old
sage somewhere in the Himalayas, but you mix

05:47.323 --> 05:54.713
up with children, you talk to them, you play
with them, have fun.

05:54.713 --> 06:02.003
At the same time He was destroying negative
forces which acted upon Him.

06:02.003 --> 06:07.463
In His playfulness only He has done it, as
a child only He has done it.

06:07.463 --> 06:14.553
How matured He was as a child you can see,
that He killed the Putana, and there are two

06:14.553 --> 06:18.454
horrible rakshasas also, He killed them.

06:19.026 --> 06:23.876
At the same time He was playing with the gopis

06:23.940 --> 06:30.037
and teasing them, troubling them, making fun of them.

06:31.363 --> 06:32.560
Why?

06:32.585 --> 06:43.555
Because He wanted them to be playful; and
all kinds of celebrations He arranged.

06:43.613 --> 06:53.103
He had once a big rain came, and He lifted
the complete mountain on His fingertips.

06:53.103 --> 06:59.273
That time these people should have understood,
it’s not possible, it’s a miracle.

06:59.273 --> 07:09.413
But He was just standing there with the one
finger at the mountain in a very simple, unassuming

07:09.413 --> 07:17.673
manner; He was doing all that to protect all
the boys who were playing with Him.

07:17.673 --> 07:27.423
Then He went and killed Kaaliya, the one who
was a big snake in the water.

07:27.423 --> 07:35.433
In the water this horrible fellow was creating
venom, and by which many people were killed.

07:35.433 --> 07:49.023
It took Him no time and He jumped inside that
horrible water of Yamuna, from where He rescued

07:49.023 --> 07:58.803
in a way all the people by killing or hitting,
or you can say that by winning over this Kaaliya.

07:58.803 --> 08:03.890
But the wives of the big serpent, they asked Him

08:03.915 --> 08:09.279
that “Please forgive him,” and He forgave.

08:09.493 --> 08:17.903
All these things show a child of six, seven
years doing all these great things without

08:17.903 --> 08:24.783
feeling what He was doing, we can say that
without even thinking about it.

08:24.783 --> 08:31.623
But He achieved it, because He was aware that
He was Shri Krishna.

08:31.623 --> 08:37.653
So first thing, you have to be aware that
you are self-realized people.

08:37.653 --> 08:47.392
You are not ordinary people to behave in an
ordinary way, you are special people made

08:47.392 --> 08:54.373
specially to reflect the qualities of God
Almighty.

08:54.373 --> 09:00.322
It’s not expected that you go and kill Kaaliya.

09:00.322 --> 09:08.023
But the situation is such today that you are
all the time protected.

09:08.023 --> 09:11.132
You are all the time protected.

09:11.132 --> 09:16.163
No one can harm you, no one can kill you,

09:16.543 --> 09:23.492
and you can be looked after
because you are Sahaja yogis.

09:26.952 --> 09:31.301
Now what should be the attitude of a Sahaja yogi

09:31.475 --> 09:35.848
towards taking decisions, one should understand.

09:36.173 --> 09:44.782
It should be a spontaneous decision.

09:44.782 --> 09:50.493
You don’t have to tally it with this, go
there and find out – immediately, spontaneous,

09:50.493 --> 09:57.863
like Shri Krishna who jumped inside the river.

09:57.863 --> 10:04.133
So in the same way you should have a very
spontaneous decision for anything.

10:04.133 --> 10:06.332
Now you want to buy, say, a carpet.

10:06.332 --> 10:07.332
All right.

10:07.332 --> 10:13.592
You go in the shop and immediately you should
know which is the one.

10:13.592 --> 10:20.832
In every walk of life you should have a very
spontaneous decision, instant decision.

10:20.832 --> 10:26.293
But what I find, the style is very different.

10:26.293 --> 10:34.332
They’ll go from shop to shop, then make
a list of it, then make all the measurements,

10:34.332 --> 10:39.712
then go home and say that “We’ll decide
it tomorrow.”

10:39.712 --> 10:44.613
That’s not the way a Sahaja yogi behaves.

10:44.613 --> 10:51.998
Sahaja yogi has to decide everything absolutely
spontaneously, at that moment.

10:53.673 --> 10:59.689
You should be like this: now somebody is getting drowned,

10:59.786 --> 11:04.557
so the first impulse should be that you have to save.

11:05.113 --> 11:08.633
And how do you save?

11:10.186 --> 11:15.572
You jump in the water – because you are
protected, nothing can happen to you,

11:15.687 --> 11:19.916
so just jump in the water and you’ll save the person.

11:20.273 --> 11:26.332
Minimum of minimum this should be your attitude,
this should be your temperament, that you

11:26.332 --> 11:30.493
take a very spontaneous decision.

11:30.493 --> 11:41.522
All this thinking and all kinds of decision-making,
and having a big conference for decisions

11:41.522 --> 11:45.702
and all that – not needed.

11:45.702 --> 11:54.832
In day-to-day life also you have to be like
that.

11:54.832 --> 12:03.152
Also in every political life, economic life
or any other life you have to lead, you have

12:03.152 --> 12:08.553
to be very spontaneous.

12:08.553 --> 12:12.973
How do you become spontaneous?

12:12.973 --> 12:13.973
What quality you have got?

12:13.973 --> 12:21.822
What is the weapon you have got, to know what
decision to take?

12:21.822 --> 12:24.932
Do you know?

12:24.932 --> 12:30.892
You have got vibrations, you have the feel of the vibrations,

12:31.106 --> 12:34.803
and you know what vibrations are.

12:34.803 --> 12:40.322
You know what vibrations tell you, and convey
and communicate to you.

12:40.322 --> 12:42.762
They speak to you.

12:42.762 --> 12:51.892
So through your vibrations you should know
in a second what should you do.

12:51.892 --> 12:57.733
For example now, somebody told Me that “Mother,
when I came to Cabella I felt tremendous vibrations.”

12:57.733 --> 12:59.723
It’s a fact.

12:59.723 --> 13:04.803
But how many of you feel that way?

13:04.803 --> 13:09.743
Because your sensitivity is not yet developed.

13:09.743 --> 13:14.332
You have to be sensitive about your vibrations.

13:14.332 --> 13:21.882
You should know looking at anyone, sitting
next to anyone, even shaking hands with anyone,

13:21.882 --> 13:29.683
you should know what sort of vibrations that
person has.

13:29.683 --> 13:32.603
This kind of sensitivity if you develop,

13:32.690 --> 13:36.793
then you will definitely take a very spontaneous decision.

13:36.793 --> 13:41.282
You know I am very good at it.

13:41.282 --> 13:49.032
I bought this Cabella in five minutes, really
five minutes.

13:49.032 --> 13:54.642
When I came here they said, “You can’t
go up, because You have big car.”

13:54.642 --> 13:58.433
So the Mayor said, “All right, come along,
I’ll take You in my car.”

13:58.433 --> 14:03.363
So I went with him on the car, on that car,
and I saw it.

14:03.363 --> 14:05.812
It was all dilapidated, no doubt.

14:05.812 --> 14:16.142
It was all absolutely in a shambles, all right,
and looked like a ghostly place, no doubt.

14:16.142 --> 14:21.303
And everybody who was with Me, they said,
“Ah, what a place, Mother!

14:21.303 --> 14:23.883
You can’t buy that.”

14:23.883 --> 14:26.742
So I told the Mayor, “I am buying it.”

14:26.742 --> 14:27.793
“When?”

14:27.793 --> 14:28.842
“Today.

14:28.842 --> 14:29.892
Now!”

14:29.892 --> 14:30.892
He was amazed.

14:30.892 --> 14:34.522
I said, “You tell Me, how do I buy?”

14:34.522 --> 14:36.322
He said, “Very easy.

14:36.322 --> 14:44.242
In this Italy You have to buy like this, that
You pay one-third of the price, all right?

14:44.242 --> 14:46.532
And then You can occupy.

14:46.532 --> 14:52.383
If You find something wrong with the place
You can give up, but then You’ll not get

14:52.383 --> 14:53.383
Your money.

14:53.383 --> 14:57.592
But if the other fellow who is selling You
says no, then he has to pay double.”

14:57.592 --> 14:59.742
I said, “Very good bargain.

14:59.742 --> 15:00.742
I am buying.

15:00.742 --> 15:02.082
I have told you I am buying.

15:02.082 --> 15:04.163
I’ll buy.”

15:04.163 --> 15:08.442
And everybody was surprised what Mother was
doing.

15:08.442 --> 15:13.063
So what decided was the vibrations.

15:13.063 --> 15:15.353
Vibrations of the place just decided.

15:15.353 --> 15:16.642
I said, “Buy it.”

15:16.642 --> 15:22.712
That way they took Me to seven, I think, castles;
I said no.

15:22.712 --> 15:28.263
Outside only I could say no, and they were
surprised I didn’t even go inside.

15:28.263 --> 15:31.192
I said, “Ask them what was here.”

15:31.192 --> 15:33.462
They said, “Nunnery.”

15:33.462 --> 15:35.733
I said, “See?”

15:35.733 --> 15:40.002
Now you should develop that kind of a spontaneous
decision.

15:40.002 --> 15:52.483
Then you will be amazed how in such a short
time you can really achieve such great things.

15:55.673 --> 16:00.168
But that doesn’t mean that you all should do that way;

16:00.193 --> 16:04.353
first you should have that sensitivity of vibrations.

16:04.353 --> 16:07.146
If you have that sensitivity of vibrations,

16:07.178 --> 16:12.669
then I would say you are now matured in Sahaja Yoga.

16:13.009 --> 16:16.258
So the maturity has to be brought in.

16:16.695 --> 16:22.756
You cannot just say, “Now it’s all right,
I have got Self-realization, I can do this.”

16:22.756 --> 16:27.856
First you tally your sense of sensitivity.

16:27.856 --> 16:32.995
So now, how do you know?

16:32.995 --> 16:41.765
For example, you take a spontaneous decision,
you find that you have got nothing, it’s

16:41.765 --> 16:44.725
all nonsense – possible.

16:44.725 --> 16:52.445
But you can see for yourself that your decisions,
if they are spontaneous: if they fail, if

16:52.445 --> 17:03.796
they are wrong, if there are some mistakes
or that will make you suffer, whether economically,

17:03.796 --> 17:13.406
politically, in every way, then your whole
value system will be judged very well how

17:13.406 --> 17:25.616
far you have gone into Sahaja Yoga, how far
you have achieved your Self-realization, and

17:25.616 --> 17:31.806
where are you.

17:31.806 --> 17:34.526
This is what is the way to test yourself.

17:34.526 --> 17:43.376
You should not be afraid of failures, and
not get enamored by success, because you are

17:43.376 --> 17:44.906
self-realized souls.

17:44.906 --> 17:52.306
Of course, if you are sensitive, immediately
you will know what is it.

17:53.202 --> 17:56.163
Now of course, I wouldn’t say that

17:56.194 --> 18:00.056
you could have the same as I have, but you should try it.

18:00.056 --> 18:07.896
Now, I have seen some people will praise some
man, “Oh Mother, he’s so good.

18:07.896 --> 18:09.546
You must meet him.

18:09.546 --> 18:17.146
He’s such a nice person and he’s of such
a help, and this will happen and that will

18:17.146 --> 18:18.146
happen.”

18:18.146 --> 18:22.426
I said, “All right, you show Me a photograph.”

18:22.426 --> 18:28.813
I said, “I am sorry, I don’t want to meet
him.”

18:29.103 --> 18:31.923
They can’t understand.

18:31.923 --> 18:35.623
“Such a great man, he’ll be a minister
tomorrow.”

18:35.623 --> 18:39.039
“I don’t want to meet him.”

18:39.129 --> 18:45.439
And you find immediately, just next day, a
big report about him in the newspaper that

18:45.439 --> 18:50.469
he’s a very bad man.

18:50.469 --> 19:00.409
So you must tally your experience and your
understanding of what you have decided spontaneously.

19:00.409 --> 19:05.649
But still I would say, keep to spontaneous
decisions.

19:05.649 --> 19:13.209
Don’t think about it how it should work
out, what should we do.

19:13.209 --> 19:27.229
It has a very far-fetched influence on your
mind also that you see, that you know what

19:27.229 --> 19:29.939
is right and what is wrong.

19:29.939 --> 19:33.579
I don’t know how many of you have seen the
house I have built.

19:33.579 --> 19:42.259
The another side of Shri Krishna was that
He was extremely creative.

19:42.259 --> 19:49.769
In His childhood He did all these things,
these pranks, and when He became a grown-up

19:49.769 --> 19:55.389
person He became the king of Dwarika, of that
area.

19:55.389 --> 20:00.689
And He used to dress up like a king only – after
all, He was a king.

20:00.689 --> 20:11.169
When He was a child He used to wear a small
little piece of a feather from the peacock,

20:11.169 --> 20:17.409
but when He became the king He was wearing
all the things, and He used to sit on the

20:17.409 --> 20:21.329
throne and talk to people in that manner.

20:21.329 --> 20:29.049
All that greatness was there, and He was extremely
creative.

20:29.049 --> 20:39.069
He built a beautiful, very, very beautiful
castle or you can say, palace in Dwarika,

20:39.069 --> 20:43.109
out of gold – can you believe it?

20:43.109 --> 20:45.729
Shri Krishna did it.

20:45.729 --> 20:48.819
And it was all then covered with water.

20:48.819 --> 20:55.119
Now the intellectuals in India, all trained
by Western people I think, said that it’s

20:55.119 --> 21:02.389
not possible, there’s nothing in the water
and He never built His palace there; it’s

21:02.389 --> 21:09.969
all a story just, just like a myth.

21:09.969 --> 21:14.179
But some people believed in it, and they dug
up.

21:14.179 --> 21:19.019
They went down and they found there was a
very big palace.

21:19.019 --> 21:23.159
There was gold little bit left, but not all
of it was there.

21:23.159 --> 21:30.599
And they were amazed, such a huge, big palace
He had made.

21:30.599 --> 21:36.089
Under the water it had gone, but it was there.

21:36.089 --> 21:43.989
Like this, all these incarnations who came
were extremely creative.

21:43.989 --> 21:48.709
If you are not creative, what’s the use
of Self-realization?

21:48.709 --> 21:54.829
Now, what is the greatest creative thing you
can do very easily is

21:55.054 --> 21:59.027
to make others Sahaja yogis.

21:59.699 --> 22:11.889
That is the easiest and most joy-giving thing,
is to make others Sahaja yogis and give them

22:11.889 --> 22:20.579
the blessings of the Divine, which they have
been seeking for ages.

22:20.579 --> 22:27.919
By giving them, you don’t know what a solace,
what a blessing you give.

22:27.919 --> 22:35.490
So now when you have got your Self-realization
– you got it very easily, I must say; they

22:35.490 --> 22:45.759
all say that it is a instant nirvana, Sahaja
Yoga is instant nirvana, it’s true – but

22:45.759 --> 22:53.219
whatever you get so easily and instantly,
you don’t understand the value of that.

22:53.219 --> 22:58.929
They always say for India that they got their
freedom so easily; they didn’t get it that

22:58.929 --> 23:00.429
easily, that’s why they do not value it.

23:00.429 --> 23:13.239
But it is true, if you get anything free firstly
and without any special effort, then you don’t

23:13.239 --> 23:15.299
value it, you don’t understand.

23:15.299 --> 23:16.819
You think it’s a matter of right.

23:16.819 --> 23:21.369
But do you know how much people have suffered
for getting Self-realization?

23:21.369 --> 23:29.329
They used to go on the Himalayas, stand on
one leg, sometimes on their heads for months

23:29.329 --> 23:34.819
together, and they didn’t get realization.

23:34.819 --> 23:44.409
I have heard of some people who lived in a
room for twenty-eight years to get Self-realization.

23:44.409 --> 23:48.739
And why they lived like that?

23:48.739 --> 23:55.449
Because they thought by keeping away from
other people, other bad atmosphere, everything,

23:55.449 --> 23:57.169
they might get realization.

23:57.169 --> 24:01.489
They never got it.

24:01.489 --> 24:05.496
So one must understand, though you have got
it very easily,

24:05.521 --> 24:12.449
it’s something so precious, so great.

24:12.579 --> 24:17.949
It’s not very easy to get Self-realization.

24:17.949 --> 24:28.079
You read about the people who are self-realized.

24:28.079 --> 24:32.959
Perhaps they did not even know how they got
it, they did not know even about the kundalini,

24:32.959 --> 24:39.419
but they got it, through their guru maybe,
maybe their efforts.

24:39.419 --> 24:47.799
Buddha, how much He had to suffer till He
gets His realization – think of Him, how

24:47.799 --> 24:50.399
He got His realization.

24:50.399 --> 25:00.469
I mean, you shudder to see of His life: ultimately
dies of hunger and poverty.

25:00.469 --> 25:03.619
But nothing happened to you.

25:03.619 --> 25:11.019
You have got it without any difficulties,
in a very sweet manner, all of you.

25:11.019 --> 25:15.099
Nothing – you don’t have to pay, you don’t
have to do anything about it.

25:15.099 --> 25:22.729
But that doesn’t mean you should not value
it.

25:22.729 --> 25:35.259
Like a seed which is put in the Mother Earth
spontaneously sprouts and gives life to the

25:35.259 --> 25:44.779
primule which grows, can grow into a shrub
and then into a tree.

25:44.779 --> 25:54.089
But you have to put water in, and you have
to have the care of a gardener or someone.

25:54.089 --> 26:01.069
In your case, you are the one who has to do
all that.

26:01.069 --> 26:11.159
First of all you have to put the nourishment
of compassion and love.

26:11.159 --> 26:14.279
Have you got that compassion and love?

26:14.279 --> 26:18.399
Do you love people?

26:18.399 --> 26:22.499
Like somebody told Me today – I was shocked
– “I don’t like children.”

26:22.499 --> 26:24.419
I said, “You don’t like children?”

26:24.419 --> 26:26.569
“No, I like others’ children, not mine.”

26:26.569 --> 26:35.199
Just imagine, how can you be doing that?

26:35.199 --> 26:40.289
How can you say such a thing, you don’t
like your own children, anything?

26:40.289 --> 26:48.149
First of all, for all of you I would say that
you should never say “I like” and “I

26:48.149 --> 26:49.289
don’t like.”

26:49.289 --> 26:50.989
These are anti-mantras.

26:50.989 --> 26:54.399
“I like this” – it’s very common.

26:54.399 --> 26:56.099
Who are you?

26:56.099 --> 26:58.379
“I don’t like this carpet.

26:58.379 --> 27:00.349
I don’t like that silver thing.”

27:00.349 --> 27:03.459
Who are you?

27:03.459 --> 27:06.449
Can you make one like that?

27:08.060 --> 27:11.545
To take a decision of that kind is also shows

27:11.583 --> 27:15.734
they think it’s very spontaneous – it’s not.

27:15.759 --> 27:20.501
It has come from your conditioning, that you
think you have a right to say “I don’t

27:20.641 --> 27:22.709
like, I don’t want.”

27:22.709 --> 27:26.709
But who are you?

27:26.709 --> 27:33.739
If you are the spirit you’ll never use these
words, because it might hurt somebody.

27:33.739 --> 27:42.449
You’ll never say something that will hurt
others, you’ll never do anything that will

27:42.449 --> 27:50.619
be dangerous for others; but always you’ll
say something that would be extremely loving

27:50.619 --> 27:52.819
and compassionate, and peace-giving.

27:52.819 --> 28:00.419
You will emit joy for others.

28:00.419 --> 28:08.839
There is the power of spirit, that it gives
joy to others.

28:08.839 --> 28:14.519
If you are a glum person, grumpy person, then
you are not self-realized.

28:14.519 --> 28:20.653
You should be able to give joy and love and compassion,

28:20.764 --> 28:26.954
and it should happen absolutely spontaneously.

28:29.359 --> 28:40.769
There’s a story about a saint in India,
in Maharashtra.

28:40.769 --> 28:50.099
So they all used to take water in a container
called as kanwar, and would take it all the

28:50.099 --> 28:55.429
way to Gujarat, to a temple of Shri Krishna.

28:55.429 --> 29:02.769
That was regarded as a great, you can say,
surrendering to Shri Krishna.

29:02.769 --> 29:08.379
So that saint also carried water in that container,
this kanwar.

29:08.379 --> 29:19.459
All the way he carried it from his village
in Maharashtra, and when he reached the temple,

29:19.459 --> 29:33.309
at the foot of that temple he saw a donkey
very thirsty, dying out of thirst.

29:33.309 --> 29:40.079
So he gave that water to that donkey.

29:40.079 --> 29:44.269
Everybody said, “Imagine, you brought this
water for miles together, for days together

29:44.269 --> 29:52.539
to be put on the deity here, and now you have
given it to this donkey.”

29:52.539 --> 30:01.679
He said, “You don’t know, God has come
all the way down here to take the water.”

30:01.679 --> 30:07.159
See the attitude that he took.

30:07.159 --> 30:16.429
So for a self-realized person the compassion
should be like that, of very generous nature.

30:16.429 --> 30:23.729
If you are not generous, if you are miserly,
always worried about your money and saving

30:23.729 --> 30:32.509
of it, then firstly you are not a matured
Sahaja yogi – you are not.

30:32.509 --> 30:38.929
Apart from that, this kind of money will never
give you any happiness.

30:38.929 --> 30:42.569
Miserliness is against spirit.

30:42.569 --> 30:48.569
Spirit is extremely generous, extremely generous.

30:48.569 --> 31:02.719
It never strives to save something, or cheat
people or steal something – is out of question;

31:02.719 --> 31:08.759
because there is no greed left in it, there
is no greed at all.

31:08.759 --> 31:16.409
And that is why such a person who is a realized
soul cannot be greedy,

31:16.638 --> 31:19.564
has to be extremely generous.

31:19.589 --> 31:28.669
I have seen many people like that who have
been extremely generous, and who have been

31:28.669 --> 31:33.329
very understanding about the problems of others.

31:33.329 --> 31:39.519
While a Sahaja yogi will have his own problems,
he is not a Sahaja yogi at all.

31:39.519 --> 31:48.189
He is there to solve the problems of others,
and not to solve his own problems and go about

31:48.189 --> 31:50.469
talking about it, “This is the problem I
have.”

31:50.469 --> 31:53.959
Now this is a new word that has developed
in modern times.

31:53.959 --> 31:59.529
They never used to use the word “problem”
before, I tell you; only for geometry we used

31:59.529 --> 32:01.229
this word “problem.”

32:01.229 --> 32:04.319
But now it has started with a … “There’s
no problem.”

32:04.319 --> 32:11.309
They are all in a problem, actually they are
problems, I think.

32:11.309 --> 32:18.139
So what you have to do is to understand that
you should not give your problems to others.

32:18.139 --> 32:25.059
You should not ask for anything, “Please
do this for me, please do that for me.”

32:25.059 --> 32:37.579
It’s very surprising that people try to
sort of take advantage of others.

32:37.579 --> 32:42.679
Now some people like to visit some countries,
so they will ask you, “Please call me.

32:42.679 --> 32:45.440
I would love to come to your country,”

32:45.512 --> 32:49.134
and a generous Sahaja yogi will say, “All right, come along.”

32:50.512 --> 32:55.099
Now, who is failing here is the person who
asked.

32:55.099 --> 33:03.089
You shouldn’t ask for anything whatsoever,
because you are complete.

33:03.089 --> 33:05.618
Not that only you are satisfied, but are complete.

33:05.618 --> 33:12.029
What can anybody give you?

33:12.029 --> 33:16.368
All desires just disappear when you are in
complete shape.

33:16.368 --> 33:19.959
Like today I was coming, I saw lots of stars
had come out.

33:19.959 --> 33:24.779
I said, “As soon as the moon will come,
they’ll all disappear.”

33:24.779 --> 33:38.499
In the same way, when you are complete, you
do not expect anybody to do anything for you.

33:38.499 --> 33:44.189
On the contrary, you want to find out what
you can do for others.

33:44.189 --> 33:47.657
You become the others, in a way that whatever

33:47.683 --> 33:51.003
is the problem of others you take upon yourhead.

33:52.829 --> 33:56.009
You jump into it.

33:56.009 --> 34:04.179
It’s a very, very interesting growth that
should come in you.

34:04.179 --> 34:13.059
It should happen to all of you, because you
have got your Self-realization.

34:13.059 --> 34:20.589
You develop a kind of a personality which
only lives for others, not for oneself.

34:20.589 --> 34:25.489
You will be amazed: you can live anywhere,
you can sleep anywhere.

34:25.489 --> 34:29.649
You can have food, you need not have food,
whatever type of food you get it’s all right,

34:29.649 --> 34:36.259
because you are so satisfied.

34:36.259 --> 34:44.269
On the contrary, you’d like to cook for
others, give them food, do whatever you like

34:44.269 --> 34:47.189
possible, you try to do.

34:47.189 --> 34:55.589
As long as you can work it out, you do it.

34:55.589 --> 35:01.439
But there are people who have only their own
problems.

35:01.439 --> 35:03.519
They are not Sahaja yogis.

35:03.519 --> 35:11.449
How can the spirit have problems?

35:11.449 --> 35:15.649
How can that happen?

35:15.649 --> 35:24.999
So just understand that you are now the spirit,
and beyond everything.

35:24.999 --> 35:31.339
So your creativity also goes to other dimensions.

35:31.339 --> 35:35.999
Of course you start giving realization to
people.

35:35.999 --> 35:38.519
You create art.

35:38.519 --> 35:44.304
You know Baba Mama, he was very bad at literature and he was – well,

35:44.359 --> 35:46.395
he didn’t know any language.

35:46.435 --> 35:51.295
He was very good for mathematics, because
My mother was a mathematician, but language

35:51.589 --> 35:53.079
he did not know.

35:53.079 --> 35:55.730
I used to write his essays, he was so bad!

35:55.730 --> 36:01.339
But after realization he wrote such beautiful
poems.

36:01.339 --> 36:03.119
Unbelievable!

36:03.119 --> 36:08.339
Nobody can believe this Baba could do that,
because he didn’t know any language well.

36:08.339 --> 36:12.849
I used to write his essays, as I told you.

36:12.849 --> 36:22.289
So, amazingly, from where he started writing
Urdu poetry, Marathi poetry, Hindi poetry?

36:22.289 --> 36:27.699
And one of My brothers asked him, “How do
you get this Urdu poetry?”

36:27.699 --> 36:31.418
He said, “Shri Mataji has, She tells me.”

36:31.418 --> 36:35.339
Everything he used to say, “Mataji tells
me.”

36:35.339 --> 36:45.721
So the creativity within you is just flowers,
and you are amazed at yourself

36:45.746 --> 36:48.529
how this creativity has come in.

36:48.529 --> 37:00.079
Now imagine, for a person who is a mathematician
becoming suddenly a poet – I mean, it’s

37:00.079 --> 37:02.629
impossible situation.

37:02.629 --> 37:04.349
And you have these capacities.

37:04.349 --> 37:10.531
You have all these capacities that you can
become very creative,

37:10.556 --> 37:15.779
and you have to be creative in every way.

37:15.779 --> 37:22.294
I am very creative, I must say, I am all the
time working out something

37:22.563 --> 37:25.610
which comes out very well.

37:26.159 --> 37:33.769
And also I don’t have that interest as normally
people have, that it should be praised by

37:33.769 --> 37:41.989
everyone or it should be, sort of, very much
in the newspapers and everything.

37:41.989 --> 37:44.639
No, no interest.

37:44.639 --> 37:51.989
You create for creation, for the sake of creation
you create, and you just enjoy that creation.

37:51.989 --> 38:03.649
And you become very adaptable, or you become
so congenial with all the things people say,

38:03.649 --> 38:08.989
talk – all right, let them do it.

38:08.989 --> 38:16.711
They will be offensive, or they could be also
praising you … you don’t know that they

38:17.522 --> 38:19.352
are praising you.

38:20.289 --> 38:23.539
Even sometimes when you “Shri Mataji ki
Jai!”

38:23.539 --> 38:32.659
– I also say, and then I forget they are
talking about Me.

38:32.659 --> 38:40.219
Somehow you are above all that, and you are
there, and you just don’t understand why

38:40.219 --> 38:47.119
human beings behave like that, why their behavior
is so funny.

38:47.119 --> 38:54.099
Even when they come to Sahaja Yoga I see they
have a great desire to be leaders, or they

38:54.099 --> 39:03.656
have a great desire to be a great organizer
of Sahaja Yoga,

39:03.681 --> 39:06.423
to be very well-known in Sahaja Yoga.

39:06.471 --> 39:16.321
They want to have an international fame as
a great Sahaja yogi.

39:16.829 --> 39:22.299
But they do not think that “What creativity
I have shown?

39:22.299 --> 39:26.199
What have I created?”

39:26.199 --> 39:32.359
Just all these things are so common in human
beings that they always want others to praise

39:32.359 --> 39:44.139
them, to have a very big sort of a exposure
– of what?

39:44.139 --> 39:47.519
If you are a spirit, everybody knows.

39:47.519 --> 39:54.949
What is there to expose, what is there to
show off, what is there to come forward?

39:54.949 --> 40:03.214
Even if you are at the back there is light,
you know there is light.

40:03.214 --> 40:11.339
So you have to get out of your darkness, because
you are the light and you spread light; instead

40:11.339 --> 40:19.078
of if you are in the darkness, what light
can you spread?

40:19.078 --> 40:23.359
So your spirit cannot have problems.

40:23.359 --> 40:27.999
It has no fear.

40:27.999 --> 40:37.879
But above all it has wisdom, tremendous wisdom,
and that wisdom is the one sign of you being

40:37.879 --> 40:40.469
a very higher personality.

40:40.469 --> 40:49.379
As I told you, this is evolution, and when
you are transformed you are evolved.

40:49.379 --> 40:58.139
Of a very different nature you become, and
you are to stand out.

40:58.139 --> 41:06.259
If Sahaja yogis are like other people, then
what’s the use of taking to Sahaja Yoga?

41:06.259 --> 41:07.699
What was Christ?

41:07.699 --> 41:10.659
He was a son of a carpenter.

41:10.659 --> 41:16.349
He never got education.

41:16.349 --> 41:19.199
But what did He do?

41:19.199 --> 41:24.789
He was the Spirit.

41:24.789 --> 41:37.239
He reflected God within Him, and that’s
why He got Himself crucified also.

41:37.239 --> 41:44.839
Now in Sahaja Yoga you don’t have to get
crucified, there are all not such testing

41:44.839 --> 41:51.939
things for you, but your value system is to
be checked.

41:51.939 --> 41:58.859
You must find out how are you working out,
through introspection.

41:58.859 --> 42:10.109
You should ask yourself, “So well now, Mr.
Sahaja yogi, how are you?

42:10.109 --> 42:14.831
Are you indulging into all these things that
these people

42:14.856 --> 42:18.902
who are not self-realized are doing?”

42:19.260 --> 42:28.020
Just try to find out, because the growth of
Sahaja Yoga is shown in your behavior, in

42:28.139 --> 42:35.099
your styles, on your face.

42:35.099 --> 42:45.929
There is no wrinkles on a person like this,
he has no worry; you don’t worry, then how

42:45.929 --> 42:48.389
will you get wrinkles?

42:48.389 --> 42:53.099
Such a person doesn’t get upset with anything.

42:53.099 --> 42:59.589
I mean, on the contrary he laughs at things.

42:59.589 --> 43:11.260
Once in a church there was in Switzerland,
one lady came to hit Me with a Bible, and

43:11.260 --> 43:12.279
I started laughing.

43:12.279 --> 43:17.289
I said, “What a thing, and I have to be
hit by a Bible!” you see.

43:17.289 --> 43:24.029
And she got such a fright that I was laughing,
and I was saying, “Look at this stupidity

43:24.029 --> 43:26.509
of this lady, coming to hit Me with a Bible!”

43:26.509 --> 43:32.589
I mean, I can understand stone or anything
else, but Bible will never hit Me.

43:32.589 --> 43:48.829
All these things have happened in your presence,
and you know about it.

43:48.829 --> 43:53.859
There are negative forces.

43:53.859 --> 43:55.379
They try to harm you.

43:55.379 --> 44:00.719
They will harm you bodily, they will harm
you mentally, they might harm you emotionally.

44:00.719 --> 44:08.959
But when you are above this, then no one harms
you.

44:08.959 --> 44:14.639
At least you never feel the harm, you are
not bothered about the harm.

44:14.639 --> 44:17.989
But what have you created?

44:17.989 --> 44:24.959
Today I had some ladies and some men, and
all for divorce.

44:24.959 --> 44:31.629
After getting married in Sahaja Yoga, they
want to have divorces, can you imagine?

44:31.629 --> 44:34.539
I was shocked.

44:34.539 --> 44:38.529
And they had funny ideas that “my husband
is like my brother.”

44:38.529 --> 44:41.139
I said, “Really?”

44:41.139 --> 44:46.779
All kinds of stupid ideas coming into their
heads means there’s no light of the spirit

44:46.779 --> 44:48.039
in them.

44:48.039 --> 44:56.739
If you have light of the spirit, then your
understanding is very different.

44:56.739 --> 45:03.119
You don’t worry about yourself, you only
worry about others, and you try to find out

45:03.119 --> 45:06.799
solutions for them.

45:06.799 --> 45:09.909
You try to help them.

45:09.909 --> 45:17.059
It is very easy for you.

45:17.059 --> 45:20.069
What is so easy for the light to burn?

45:20.069 --> 45:24.539
Once it is enlightened, it is burning.

45:24.539 --> 45:26.799
It’s difficult for it to go out of light.

45:26.799 --> 45:33.789
But for human beings, I can’t understand,
even after realization, after growing for

45:33.789 --> 45:41.509
years together they are still so stupid that
they don’t realize the value of their Self-realization.

45:41.509 --> 45:54.359
It is something, the spirit, you cannot kill
it.

45:54.359 --> 45:55.899
It cannot blow off.

45:55.899 --> 46:02.059
This light will go off, but the light of the
spirit won’t go off.

46:02.059 --> 46:11.619
But what is the oil that keeps it there is
your compassion, is love, care of others.

46:11.619 --> 46:17.059
I know there are people who are very, say,
dominating, may be troublesome, what else

46:17.059 --> 46:18.969
– but care for them.

46:18.969 --> 46:24.869
Know that they are not like you, they are
not complete, they have problems; so you care

46:24.869 --> 46:26.029
for them.

46:26.029 --> 46:30.259
But instead of that, you start thinking that
“Why should I care for him?

46:30.259 --> 46:31.359
How does he care for me?” or something.

46:31.359 --> 46:34.219
Then you are finished.

46:34.219 --> 46:43.569
So this kind of a reflection, or I would say
the reaction, is not that of a spirit.

46:43.569 --> 46:48.489
A spiritual person’s reactions are very,
very different.

46:48.489 --> 46:57.178
In the life of Shri Krishna you can see that
He had a friend who was very poor, and he

46:57.178 --> 47:00.769
wanted to meet Shri Krishna.

47:00.769 --> 47:07.789
And the wife of the friend gave him some rice
crispies, as you call them, “And that’s,

47:07.789 --> 47:09.879
take for your friend.

47:09.879 --> 47:11.589
You must take something for your friend.”

47:11.589 --> 47:15.319
He was a little shy, you know.

47:15.319 --> 47:23.149
And when he went to Shri Krishna, Shri Krishna
was in His palace, and the people at the door

47:23.149 --> 47:25.019
said, “No, you can’t meet Him.”

47:25.019 --> 47:26.699
He said, “All right.

47:26.699 --> 47:31.379
You just go and tell Him that Sudama has come.”

47:31.379 --> 47:38.609
He was sitting on the throne discussing something,
and He said, “Sudama has come!”

47:38.609 --> 47:52.658
He rushed out and went to the door and hugged
him, hugged him again and again; and He said,

47:52.658 --> 47:56.689
“Why are you standing here?”

47:56.689 --> 48:07.419
He took him and put him on the throne that
He was supposed to, and He told His wives,

48:07.419 --> 48:10.908
“Please come and wash his feet.”

48:10.908 --> 48:14.009
And then they brought for him clothes and
all that.

48:14.009 --> 48:24.079
He had a bath; He made him sleep on His bed
– see the love of Shri Krishna.

48:24.079 --> 48:28.829
He had very dirty feet, all were cracked.

48:28.829 --> 48:36.869
He tried to put on that some sort of a medicine
by which it would be all right.

48:36.869 --> 48:42.769
He tried to do whatever was possible to him
to cure those cracks.

48:42.769 --> 48:51.479
And He asked him to sleep on His bed, and
asked the ladies to fan him so that he doesn’t

48:51.479 --> 48:53.819
feel hot.

48:53.819 --> 49:01.769
See the compassion of Shri Krishna, it shows
so beautifully.

49:01.769 --> 49:05.329
Are we that compassionate?

49:05.329 --> 49:14.559
There was no need for Him to do that; it was
no drama, nothing – but His heart!

49:14.559 --> 49:19.049
He took a spontaneous decision.

49:19.049 --> 49:23.509
When He heard Sudama is there, He just rushed
there.

49:23.509 --> 49:33.249
He just felt so happy that “My old friend
has come.”

49:33.249 --> 49:49.329
Then, when He went to Hastinapur, there the
Duryodhan, the Kauravas’ eldest son, he

49:49.329 --> 49:52.599
asked Him that “Why don’t You come and
stay in my palace?”

49:52.599 --> 50:02.168
He said, “All right, I can come, but you
see, I will go and have food with Vidur.”

50:02.168 --> 50:06.839
Vidur was a son of a maid.

50:06.839 --> 50:13.769
He went and had His food with Vidur.

50:13.769 --> 50:22.839
Now Vidur being a poor man, I don’t know
what food he must have given Him, while Duryodhan

50:22.839 --> 50:26.579
would have given Him such sumptuous food.

50:26.579 --> 50:30.489
So for such people, taste and the level of
food and all doesn’t matter; it’s the

50:30.489 --> 50:41.559
love, the respect of Vidur, who was a realized
soul – respecting other Sahaja yogis.

50:41.559 --> 50:53.699
If a Sahaja yogi respects somebody who is
a governor – I can’t understand; the spirit

50:53.699 --> 50:59.519
is above everything else – and does not
respect a Sahaja yogi, there’s something

50:59.519 --> 51:01.829
wrong with him.

51:01.829 --> 51:08.099
He should understand that this spiritual person
is higher than all these people who have these,

51:08.099 --> 51:16.529
all kinds of these big names behind them.

51:16.529 --> 51:29.219
And that love is shown in everybody’s life:
all the saints, all the incarnations, everyone

51:29.219 --> 51:39.418
had that love which was above everything else,
without expecting anything, not doing it just

51:39.418 --> 51:43.609
to expect something from them.

51:43.609 --> 51:54.339
It is a kind of a personality which really
reflects God’s love.

51:54.339 --> 51:56.739
That reflection should come from you.

51:56.739 --> 52:04.889
You are Sahaja yogis: that doesn’t mean
that you are something higher than others,

52:04.889 --> 52:07.918
but you are different.

52:07.918 --> 52:10.949
You are above them.

52:10.949 --> 52:14.049
You have no superiority, that’s why you
are different.

52:14.049 --> 52:18.919
You are so humble, that’s why you are different.

52:18.919 --> 52:24.719
You are so joyous, you are so peaceful, that’s
why you are humble.

52:24.719 --> 52:34.579
There are so many things I can tell you from
the life of Shri Krishna, showing He was,

52:34.579 --> 52:38.289
they call Him Yogeshwara.

52:38.289 --> 52:41.219
He was a Lord of Yoga.

52:41.219 --> 52:47.139
It is because He was Virat.

52:47.139 --> 53:00.269
But He showed it, His form, only to Arjuna,
to nobody else, because nobody was like Arjuna.

53:00.269 --> 53:05.939
Arjuna also got a fright when he saw that.

53:05.939 --> 53:16.379
So He lived like Shri Krishna, like a cowboy
He was living in Gokul, and He never showed

53:16.379 --> 53:18.059
off His powers.

53:18.059 --> 53:26.959
His powers were within Himself, which were
expressing spontaneously.

53:26.959 --> 53:37.709
This power has wisdom and discretion, complete
discretion.

53:37.709 --> 53:46.750
If it does not have then this is not divine
power, this is some satanic power: because

53:46.750 --> 53:55.709
somebody is nice to you if you are nice to
that person, nothing doing.

53:55.709 --> 54:04.359
Mostly we had in India people who were called
as avadhutas.

54:04.359 --> 54:12.459
They were the realized souls who had gone
away from the society, from the multitudes,

54:12.459 --> 54:22.819
and gone and lived in some small little place
or some cave or somewhere, hidden from others;

54:22.819 --> 54:31.729
because they thought nobody is going to understand
them, so what’s the use of talking to them.

54:31.729 --> 54:38.279
They were singled out, one person here and
one person there.

54:38.279 --> 54:39.379
What could they do?

54:39.379 --> 54:45.309
They were not like you, so many of Sahaja
yogis together.

54:45.309 --> 54:49.719
You have so many friends and you have so many
others with you.

54:49.719 --> 54:55.859
They were lonely people, and they hid themselves
from the society.

54:55.859 --> 55:02.219
They would not meet people, because if they
tried anything they would be crucified.

55:02.219 --> 55:08.329
But not you people, because you have a society.

55:08.329 --> 55:21.158
You have a beautiful enlightened society of
very good friends, of very good spiritual

55:21.158 --> 55:22.319
people.

55:22.319 --> 55:31.759
With all this if you cannot create, then what
should I say?

55:31.759 --> 55:44.589
You have to create something: may be art,
may be music, may be poetry, may be literature,

55:44.589 --> 55:50.019
may be writing – whatever it is, you have
to create.

55:50.019 --> 55:54.168
And above all, you have to create Sahaja yogis.

55:54.168 --> 55:58.499
That’s the main creation you have to achieve.

55:58.499 --> 56:06.659
That’s the main thing you have to have,
is creating Sahaja yogis all over.

56:06.659 --> 56:13.589
And there I can go to places, can have programs,
do everything.

56:13.589 --> 56:22.039
But you have to show with your own example
that this is something great, how they have

56:22.039 --> 56:28.499
achieved this state; we should achieve also
that state.

56:28.499 --> 56:40.658
So you will be the ones who will really inspire
them, who will really make them follow you

56:40.658 --> 56:45.309
and take to a life of a Sahaja yogi.

56:45.309 --> 56:54.339
Actually you are Mahayogis, if you become
complete – and you have to become.

56:54.339 --> 57:00.959
Nothing is more important than becoming a
Mahayogi, by which your spirit gives joy,

57:03.859 --> 57:09.499
peace and blessings to everyone.

57:09.489 --> 57:15.789
May God bless you.
