1
00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:07,030
An introduction in English begins at 7mins 48secs.

2
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:55,182
Very shortly, I have just
introduced three points of

3
00:07:55,186 --> 00:07:59,302
check list the plane is
undergoing, before taking off

4
00:07:59,304 --> 00:08:01,804
to be sure that it can fly and before Puja,

5
00:08:01,823 --> 00:08:05,260
there are a few things we have to remember.

6
00:08:05,263 --> 00:08:07,763
One is that you are not sitting here

7
00:08:07,763 --> 00:08:11,563
as U.N.observers with
our analytical faculties

8
00:08:11,573 --> 00:08:13,663
this allow us to try to find
out what is going on and

9
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:16,173
whether we like it or not.

10
00:08:16,183 --> 00:08:21,443
Because the mental activity
is going to prevent us

11
00:08:21,443 --> 00:08:24,493
to feel the reality of
the event. The same way

12
00:08:24,483 --> 00:08:26,823
that shoes prevent us to feel the ground

13
00:08:26,833 --> 00:08:29,333
with our own skin and the same way that

14
00:08:29,353 --> 00:08:32,493
shoes are left before the door of the temple,

15
00:08:32,493 --> 00:08:36,913
in the same way, the mental has to be kept

16
00:08:36,913 --> 00:08:39,403
at the door of the Puja,

17
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:43,013
so that we can maintain relationship with

18
00:08:43,013 --> 00:08:47,303
what really is going on in truth and in reality here.

19
00:08:47,299 --> 00:08:49,799
This is first part of the check list.

20
00:08:49,799 --> 00:08:52,719
Second part of the check list is that, what is really

21
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:59,169
going on here is that, it is a ceremony for us,

22
00:08:59,172 --> 00:09:03,309
not for Shri Mataji.  It is for us. We are benefitting

23
00:09:03,315 --> 00:09:05,815
from the Puja, not Shri Mataji.

24
00:09:05,815 --> 00:09:09,435
Why? Becasue Shri Mataji is on the tenth floor.

25
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:11,165
We are on the first floor.

26
00:09:11,166 --> 00:09:14,055
When Shri Mataji is
Mahamaya, when She talks

27
00:09:14,064 --> 00:09:16,564
in a Public Programme,
when She speaks to us

28
00:09:16,569 --> 00:09:18,314
as a normal human being,

29
00:09:18,314 --> 00:09:19,934
She climbed down from the tenth floor

30
00:09:19,934 --> 00:09:22,434
and She looked very human, one of us

31
00:09:22,434 --> 00:09:24,934
and this is not so. She is not one of us, in that

32
00:09:24,934 --> 00:09:27,824
sense. Although She is
much more human than

33
00:09:27,824 --> 00:09:29,174
all of us put together.

34
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:31,690
In truth She is not a Human Being. All right?

35
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:35,964
Now,

36
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:40,190
What happened is... in a
Puja we address ourselves

37
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:42,961
to Shri Mataji in the
dimension where She is on

38
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:45,231
the tenth floor.

39
00:09:45,231 --> 00:09:48,501
We address ourselves
to Her for what She is

40
00:09:48,497 --> 00:09:53,271
which is...The Infinite One

41
00:09:53,271 --> 00:09:58,606
and through this, the frequency of Shri Mataji's

42
00:09:58,626 --> 00:10:01,320
Chakras, which are addressed
in the proper protocol

43
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:09,391
start revolving... start
revolving at a much more

44
00:10:09,392 --> 00:10:11,511
subtle and higher frequency.

45
00:10:11,517 --> 00:10:15,167
In such a way, we can
absorb within three of four

46
00:10:15,162 --> 00:10:19,122
hours of Puja, what we cannot achieve

47
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:22,122
within one or two years, perhaps, of meditation

48
00:10:22,135 --> 00:10:26,042
at home. This is the
perception we have to have

49
00:10:26,045 --> 00:10:29,616
before Puja, that we are here to benefit.

50
00:10:29,646 --> 00:10:31,652
It is for us.

51
00:10:31,652 --> 00:10:33,912
Because we enter in a relationship with Her

52
00:10:33,912 --> 00:10:38,582
in Her Truth, which is that She is the Goddess.

53
00:10:38,583 --> 00:10:41,083
Even if we don't know
it, even if we doubt it,

54
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:46,213
even if we have questions
about it, this is our problem.

55
00:10:46,235 --> 00:10:49,923
The grass is green outside,
whether you like it or not

56
00:10:49,923 --> 00:10:52,125
and whether you are doubting or not.

57
00:10:52,125 --> 00:10:54,593
If you see the grass red, it's your problem.

58
00:10:54,575 --> 00:10:57,943
In the same way Shri Mataji is Adi Shakti.

59
00:10:57,973 --> 00:11:01,503
She is The Holy Spirit. She is the Primoridal Being

60
00:11:01,487 --> 00:11:07,313
and those who have not realised it
and there are many of us who have not,

61
00:11:07,323 --> 00:11:11,893
because it is a sacred privilege
to enter into that mystery.

62
00:11:11,883 --> 00:11:18,153
Next, with a desire to progress on the discovery
of the true nature of who Shri Mataji is.

63
00:11:18,151 --> 00:11:22,205
OK?  Puja is just for this.

64
00:11:22,205 --> 00:11:27,751
That was the second point that we are here
to benefit and what was the third point?

65
00:11:27,740 --> 00:11:32,190
Now let's see if anyone has listened to me here.

66
00:11:36,143 --> 00:11:38,643
I shouldn't forget it!  I'm sorry!

67
00:11:41,446 --> 00:11:45,962
OK. The third point is humility.

68
00:11:45,975 --> 00:11:48,475
You see,

69
00:11:50,646 --> 00:11:55,972
I remember one line, which was
written in this book and this is that

70
00:11:55,976 --> 00:12:02,746
humility is the security
of those who come near God,

71
00:12:02,742 --> 00:12:06,076
because God is something just... it's too much

72
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:08,456
I mean, just way out

73
00:12:08,456 --> 00:12:12,666
There is no way, we can start
grasping what that Being

74
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:17,456
is; even if it sitting before us in this little chair.

75
00:12:17,456 --> 00:12:21,292
So, we come with all kind of stuff within us,

76
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:24,622
which is perhaps nice, and
perhaps also not so nice.

77
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:34,928
The only way, we can come nearer to this
fantastic reality is to be humble;

78
00:12:34,958 --> 00:12:42,093
or else happens... what
has happened to many of us.

79
00:12:42,115 --> 00:12:45,303
is that we have to learn it the hard way.

80
00:12:45,333 --> 00:12:59,653
We are whirled around in various
paths of tests and tensions for us to discover

81
00:12:59,651 --> 00:13:06,913
that our ego is the one
who keeps us out of reality.

82
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:14,430
Now we all have desires here. Right?  One is the desire to improve his health. OK

83
00:13:14,437 --> 00:13:17,057
Another one is the desire to get a job.

84
00:13:17,049 --> 00:13:24,047
The third one is the desire that
his wife should be all right.

85
00:13:24,047 --> 00:13:26,732
The third one, the fourth
one, the fifth one! OK?

86
00:13:26,732 --> 00:13:29,392
Everybody has a problem here alright.

87
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:37,342
Now please put this shopping
bag of demands on the side

88
00:13:37,353 --> 00:13:43,278
and have only one desire, is
to be one with The Supreme,

89
00:13:43,298 --> 00:13:46,098
to be one with the reality

90
00:13:46,128 --> 00:13:50,108
to be one with God, because
that is what your Kundalini is,

91
00:13:50,107 --> 00:13:53,604
the desire to be one with God.

92
00:13:53,607 --> 00:14:01,466
And by asking for this, ask for the supreme.
The other things will be given 'en passant.'

93
00:14:01,466 --> 00:14:08,204
Don't ask for small stuff, because
you are facing a big giver

94
00:14:08,224 --> 00:14:11,978
and don't come in front of someone, who
has one billion dollars in the pocket

95
00:14:11,978 --> 00:14:13,947
asking for 5 dollars.

96
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:18,808
Don't! It's stupid. It's not as
a Swiss that I'm speaking to you.

97
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:22,400
It's a Sahaja Yogi; although
there is some element

98
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:26,124
of Swiss consciousness
in this , I suppose.

99
00:14:27,729 --> 00:14:34,431
Be clever! You are in front of the biggest
giver of the world and don't ask for peanuts.

100
00:14:39,504 --> 00:14:41,534
It is true.  She is that

101
00:14:41,551 --> 00:14:45,948
If you would know, you would be
floating one metre above ground.

102
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:49,328
I see some of you sitting
there, you just don't know it.

103
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:53,658
So ask, "Mother may I know Who You are?"

104
00:14:56,329 --> 00:15:05,789
You would shoot through your top like...
Have the courage to ask for reality.

105
00:15:05,789 --> 00:15:08,849
Have that courage! You
are big enough for this.

106
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:13,419
In all dimensions of that word.

107
00:15:17,768 --> 00:15:22,808
We are no small people, even if we look
completely screwed up, we are big people.

108
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:25,302
or else She would not
have picked us up,

109
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,820
The fourth point of the check list

110
00:19:10,855 --> 00:19:13,355
Fourth is confidence.

111
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:19,718
Everybody has difficulties and
everybody has to overcome them.

112
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:28,453
 Each test is a blessing and each blessing is a test.

113
00:19:28,454 --> 00:19:34,162
So even if we are not so good in Sahaja
Yoga, even if we don't meditate so well,

114
00:19:34,187 --> 00:19:40,582
even if we think that our attention is useless, even
if we have within our brains things which are dirty,

115
00:19:40,574 --> 00:19:43,074
It does not matter,

116
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:52,038
because we will overcome. We will
be stronger than negativity.

117
00:19:52,050 --> 00:19:58,190
We participate in this cosmic
fight against the assuric vidya,

118
00:19:58,193 --> 00:20:06,297
against the black knowledge of the
evil which is completely active now,

119
00:20:06,306 --> 00:20:08,116
because the powers
which are given to us

120
00:20:08,147 --> 00:20:12,806
are greater than the powers
of evil. It is a fact.

121
00:20:16,206 --> 00:20:18,706
Jai Shri Mataji.

122
00:20:21,503 --> 00:20:24,599
Now, we are going to do with.....

123
00:20:41,078 --> 00:20:49,817
Music plays until Shri Mataji arrives at 22mins 14 secs.

124
00:24:49,095 --> 00:25:01,824
Today we have gathered here in this beautiful
place, to work out something very deep.

125
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:23,471
There are certain things of which we
are not aware, which are in the history,

126
00:25:29,418 --> 00:25:34,908
and some things in the atmosphere,

127
00:25:36,002 --> 00:25:39,278
they affect us very much,

128
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:47,402
because we are the product of five elements,

129
00:25:53,150 --> 00:26:01,749
out of which the Mother Earth
is the left side within us.

130
00:26:07,251 --> 00:26:15,527
The Mother Earth changes its atmosphere

131
00:26:15,537 --> 00:26:22,242
its hills and dales, rivers,
fashions them in such a way

132
00:26:22,243 --> 00:26:28,554
 that it gives a variety
to her temperaments.

133
00:26:40,576 --> 00:26:45,582
Now God has created only one world,
He’s not created many worlds,

134
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,110
He’s created only one
world, this world,

135
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:55,240
 where alone here only
human beings are created.

136
00:27:03,399 --> 00:27:07,633
So, this is the most
important planet, you can say,

137
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:13,023
which has been in the
attention of the Divine.

138
00:27:21,568 --> 00:27:28,698
So, the whole cosmos works out
for the benefit of this planet,

139
00:27:35,993 --> 00:27:46,003
and the working of that cosmos has created this earth, and then human beings, and then the Sahaja Yogis.

140
00:27:56,027 --> 00:28:05,108
So, the Sahaja Yogis are the
epitome of the creative powers.

141
00:28:11,429 --> 00:28:15,126
They are the epitome of God’s desire,

142
00:28:18,034 --> 00:28:20,534
that’s what He desired.

143
00:28:21,943 --> 00:28:27,067
That’s why He created this cosmos,
this universe and this earth.

144
00:28:34,075 --> 00:28:37,447
So now His desire is fulfilled

145
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:46,756
when He sees His Being
reflected through the Sahaja Yogis

146
00:28:52,447 --> 00:29:00,799
But there is still a few things we
have to clear out within ourselves.

147
00:29:10,953 --> 00:29:15,736
His desire represents the
Mahakali power within us.

148
00:29:20,628 --> 00:29:27,338
Now we have to see how His desire
has worked in creating ourselves.

149
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:36,448
First is the desire which is absolutely passionate.

150
00:29:40,549 --> 00:29:49,065
There’s nothing desired, nothing else is
desired, but the creation of Sahaja Yogis.

151
00:30:00,164 --> 00:30:08,443
So, the first desire of any Sahaja
Yogi is to create more Sahaja Yogis.

152
00:30:14,936 --> 00:30:21,154
No other desire should be
dominant or exist, in a way;

153
00:30:27,172 --> 00:30:32,992
but to fulfill that desire, we
have to fulfill some conditions.

154
00:30:37,668 --> 00:30:43,401
So, one of the conditions, the
most important, is the sincerity,

155
00:30:48,439 --> 00:30:55,689
as God doesn’t need that qualification, He
cannot be insincere even if He wants to be.

156
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:11,904
He does not have your type of intellect
which can play devious roles with Him,

157
00:31:20,379 --> 00:31:28,261
but the human beings have got this devious
intellect, which plays very much around.

158
00:31:39,002 --> 00:31:45,481
But as Sahaja Yogis you can see that
intellect very carefully and clearly.

159
00:31:50,218 --> 00:31:57,252
God is egoless because He does
everything, so He’s egoless,

160
00:32:03,673 --> 00:32:10,887
or we can say He is the Ego only,
if that means doing something.

161
00:32:15,965 --> 00:32:17,975
But human beings have ego

162
00:32:17,983 --> 00:32:21,773
 because they don’t do anything
and think they’re doing something.

163
00:32:35,055 --> 00:32:37,555
You know this very well.

164
00:32:42,224 --> 00:32:45,192
So, when you start assuming
that you do something,

165
00:32:45,174 --> 00:32:47,942
 you get identified with
such myths very easily,

166
00:32:47,962 --> 00:32:52,552
only human beings can be
identified with Myths, not God.

167
00:33:02,849 --> 00:33:07,061
But after Realisation you
can see your ego clearly.

168
00:33:11,872 --> 00:33:14,372
It acts in various ways.

169
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:21,502
If we appoint somebody as a leader,

170
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:24,692
the leader may start thinking
that he’s really the leader,

171
00:33:34,549 --> 00:33:38,729
and then it becomes really a problem for him

172
00:33:38,729 --> 00:33:45,279
because he starts losing
everything that is leadership.

173
00:33:56,505 --> 00:34:00,496
But the worst is, their wives start
thinking they are the leaders,

174
00:34:07,818 --> 00:34:12,669
and sometimes the children
also think that way;

175
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:28,977
 and I won’t be surprised even if
their dogs and pets behave that way.

176
00:34:38,744 --> 00:34:42,513
It can be any stupid thing.

177
00:34:47,502 --> 00:34:55,955
So, with this kind of an ego a Sahaja Yogi
can see, you see, himself, how he behaves.

178
00:35:03,183 --> 00:35:09,823
I watch them and it provides a lot of humour for Me

179
00:35:09,803 --> 00:35:11,033
I watch them with their ego.

180
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,313
"Them" being the leaders?

181
00:35:12,353 --> 00:35:13,943
No, no, no!  All!  All of them.

182
00:35:13,933 --> 00:35:15,033
I was worried.

183
00:35:29,483 --> 00:35:33,793
They push forward everywhere,
they’ll sit in the forward line,

184
00:35:33,826 --> 00:35:37,072
they’ll push forward, they’ll be there first to

185
00:35:37,092 --> 00:35:41,202
come in the front line,
sort of thing is there.

186
00:35:54,381 --> 00:35:57,389
But if you are a sincere person,

187
00:35:57,389 --> 00:36:03,899
if you have the sincerity, then you’ll enjoy
that sincerity wherever you are standing,

188
00:36:03,911 --> 00:36:06,411
wherever you are sitting.

189
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:20,493
So, the ego can try to deceive
you very much all the time,

190
00:36:20,504 --> 00:36:23,116
so you have to be
careful about this ego

191
00:36:23,116 --> 00:36:26,716
 because he can sit on your
head and can monitor you.

192
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:48,121
 I have seen people going down very rapidly
with this idea that they’re something special.

193
00:36:58,679 --> 00:37:02,549
So, sincerity, though it is
the quality of the left side,

194
00:37:02,549 --> 00:37:06,049
can be dominated by the
right side, this way.

195
00:37:18,073 --> 00:37:23,763
The second thing about your desire,
that it should be a pure desire

196
00:37:30,281 --> 00:37:36,113
and the pure desire is very simple for
you because I’m sitting before you.

197
00:37:44,295 --> 00:37:48,495
The pure desire of a
seeker is to see God,

198
00:37:48,489 --> 00:37:57,136
to be in the company of God,
to be in association with God.

199
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:22,053
As they call it, Salokya, Samipya and
Sanidya; there are three words describing it.

200
00:38:27,891 --> 00:38:32,521
But without asking, without thinking of it,

201
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:36,951
you have been given the fourth
dimension called as the Tadatmya,

202
00:38:36,950 --> 00:38:40,886
means becoming one with My body, My being;

203
00:38:53,075 --> 00:38:56,250
so that you become protected,

204
00:38:56,260 --> 00:38:58,070
absolutely cleansed

205
00:38:58,070 --> 00:39:00,570
 and nourished in My being.

206
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:12,299
But when you are not aware of it,

207
00:39:12,309 --> 00:39:14,119
then what happens,

208
00:39:14,149 --> 00:39:18,437
that I have to suffer in My body to cleanse you.

209
00:39:28,772 --> 00:39:34,580
So, all other desires can
create problems within you.

210
00:39:43,364 --> 00:39:51,314
Now as I was telling you that this France
is a creation of the Mother Earth,

211
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:53,833
with her special features.

212
00:40:00,306 --> 00:40:05,435
We have to examine what effects
it can have on a French mind.

213
00:40:13,129 --> 00:40:20,869
It’s a historical build-up also
which affects this country.

214
00:40:26,894 --> 00:40:29,586
It’s a very affluent country,

215
00:40:29,561 --> 00:40:35,474
 you have got very rich soil and you produce beautiful agricultural products.

216
00:40:40,694 --> 00:40:52,316
So, when you are satisfied on the material
level then you start moving left or right,

217
00:41:01,531 --> 00:41:05,280
because you are very
naïve about one thing,

218
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:12,010
that we have to rise higher,
higher into our ascent.

219
00:41:22,959 --> 00:41:29,706
Also, that we are not aware that
that is the goal for our evolution.

220
00:41:36,721 --> 00:41:43,345
So, we all have to ascend, that’s
all, nothing else is important.

221
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:57,298
So as soon as you find that
materially you are all right,

222
00:41:57,302 --> 00:42:03,588
then if you do not have the
idea that you have to ascend,

223
00:42:03,586 --> 00:42:07,268
you can really move on to
the left and the right.

224
00:42:21,004 --> 00:42:29,986
France being a very, very affluent country
among most of the European and the English,

225
00:42:30,002 --> 00:42:37,426
they got into this movement much
earlier than any other country.

226
00:42:49,035 --> 00:42:56,914
So, the, if you can find the aggressiveness
of the French, based on these lines,

227
00:42:56,934 --> 00:42:59,434
because they go to the right side.

228
00:43:06,862 --> 00:43:14,802
Like the French are never bothered to see or to find out what is the culture of other people.

229
00:43:25,093 --> 00:43:28,783
They’re very self-opinionated
and thought no end of themselves

230
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:32,123
and they thought they knew
all what was culture is.

231
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:47,182
As a result, they became completely
ignorant of all other cultures

232
00:43:47,168 --> 00:43:50,061
which were much more
evolved than theirs

233
00:44:01,676 --> 00:44:11,359
The concept of beauty came up to
a certain level of understanding

234
00:44:11,365 --> 00:44:15,874
and then again it deviated
into wrong direction.

235
00:44:27,902 --> 00:44:32,378
Also, I would say, the way the
Christianity was preached in those days,

236
00:44:32,374 --> 00:44:35,828
no respect for women was there.

237
00:44:45,738 --> 00:44:49,552
So, the women did not understand
that they are the left side

238
00:44:49,552 --> 00:44:52,682
and they have to look
after their chastity.

239
00:45:07,350 --> 00:45:15,356
In the beginning whenever I read about
French, like Emile Zola or other people

240
00:45:15,356 --> 00:45:22,596
Maupassant, all that, what I found
that women were not at all respected,

241
00:45:22,602 --> 00:45:25,102
nor they were respectable,

242
00:45:38,426 --> 00:45:44,356
or if you read, say, for example, Nana,
is a one, he has written, Emile Zola;

243
00:45:44,354 --> 00:45:49,336
if you read her, you will be surprised that they have given the four sides of a woman in one woman,

244
00:45:49,323 --> 00:45:51,823
he has described four sides.

245
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:04,264
And one part which is really a woman
is never respected in the society

246
00:46:04,274 --> 00:46:09,368
when she is compassionate and good,
that part she’s not respected:

247
00:46:09,377 --> 00:46:11,258
on the contrary she’s kicked out.

248
00:46:11,258 --> 00:46:18,497
So, in other parts, she behaves a cunning
woman, or she behaves like a prostitute,

249
00:46:18,520 --> 00:46:23,885
or she behaves like an aggressive woman,
because the part that is respectable,

250
00:46:23,889 --> 00:46:28,005
and that is the one which was for
her ascent and was her innate,

251
00:46:28,005 --> 00:46:31,319
was not at all understood or respected.

252
00:46:59,853 --> 00:47:07,483
So, the instrument of the left side which are the women of this country were first harmed

253
00:47:16,376 --> 00:47:22,943
and these became the main
source of troubles in France.

254
00:47:31,448 --> 00:47:35,011
On the other side, they
became extremely aggressive;

255
00:47:37,781 --> 00:47:44,133
the men became aggressive and because women were not respected, they also became aggressive.

256
00:47:48,638 --> 00:47:53,653
The other women who could not
do that became extreme left,

257
00:47:53,658 --> 00:47:57,988
started crying, weeping and melancholy;

258
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:03,720
melancholy character they
developed, melancholy.

259
00:48:20,165 --> 00:48:26,265
Then they started, you see, writing
about all this melancholy nonsense,

260
00:48:26,273 --> 00:48:33,275
which doesn’t exist and indulging into
it, like wine or some sort of a thing.

261
00:48:37,235 --> 00:48:42,502
The movement on the left-hand side, naturally, because men also got attracted towards it,

262
00:48:42,481 --> 00:48:46,328
made them take to
left-sided food as well.

263
00:48:52,817 --> 00:49:00,184
Now, for example, they developed the
cheese which was all full of fungus,

264
00:49:00,224 --> 00:49:03,070
which was dead matter.

265
00:49:14,020 --> 00:49:16,520
Fungus kills all that is right side;

266
00:49:20,242 --> 00:49:22,742
anything living can be
killed with fungus.

267
00:49:26,432 --> 00:49:30,132
Not only as far as the food is
concerned but temperamentally

268
00:49:30,122 --> 00:49:33,502
gradually they started
becoming like funguses.

269
00:49:44,777 --> 00:49:52,546
So, the fungus itself has a quality, is
to, that it thrives on the dead matter.

270
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:06,579
So they went down to all places where they
could find the dead matter, like Egypt.

271
00:50:17,015 --> 00:50:20,668
They were not very much interested
in India, even to rule India,

272
00:50:26,082 --> 00:50:32,849
but they were very much interested
in Egyptian dead things

273
00:50:32,860 --> 00:50:39,011
and other places wherever they could
find this dead stuff available to them.

274
00:50:51,399 --> 00:50:57,270
Also, I would say Christianity,
which started decaying very much,

275
00:50:57,302 --> 00:50:59,802
became a big hold in France.

276
00:51:14,438 --> 00:51:17,192
Religion also became like a fungus;

277
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:35,380
like building, say, big churches
and around them to bury the dead.

278
00:51:44,518 --> 00:51:51,183
Now, I went to see Chartres; you have a
beautiful, a very, very beautiful church

279
00:51:51,217 --> 00:51:58,743
and very good work done by the artist, but there are lying all dead bodies all around, it’s horrible.

280
00:52:11,363 --> 00:52:18,248
Actually, dead people should be burnt,
only the realised soul can be buried.

281
00:52:37,684 --> 00:52:47,099
The sense of respect was lacking very much,
even in the history, you can see clearly.

282
00:52:52,855 --> 00:52:55,355
What was important
throughout was the money.

283
00:52:59,775 --> 00:53:08,522
As I see the French revolution took place when I must say the queen was not a bad woman at all.

284
00:53:22,203 --> 00:53:26,248
She was actually a great protégée.

285
00:53:26,254 --> 00:53:31,218
She was a protector of all the artists of France

286
00:53:31,204 --> 00:53:37,923
and she’s the one who gave such a
great momentum to the art of France.

287
00:53:46,923 --> 00:53:55,720
If she created something like a furniture piece or any building, today even you show it with pride.

288
00:54:00,512 --> 00:54:06,858
After all she was not going to take it with
her; it was for France she made everything.

289
00:54:10,611 --> 00:54:13,764
But the French wanted more
money to be distributed.

290
00:54:13,764 --> 00:54:17,881
For what? For drinking more wine,

291
00:54:27,499 --> 00:54:30,551
 not to create anything
of eternal interest.

292
00:54:39,711 --> 00:54:44,466
That’s why I say those who drink have no
right to strike, or to ask for more money

293
00:54:44,445 --> 00:54:48,247
because they have more money,
that’s why they drink.

294
00:55:02,192 --> 00:55:09,040
So, I don’t believe in capitalism, but I do believe that those who can create something new,

295
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:17,031
who can create something – not new in the sense of nonsense, but a thing of eternal values

296
00:55:17,053 --> 00:55:20,731
must be given money to create that.

297
00:55:36,057 --> 00:55:38,557
There are many capitalists
who do wrong things,

298
00:55:38,557 --> 00:55:43,992
like buying instruments of
war and things like that.

299
00:55:53,832 --> 00:55:56,953
Now we have England, we have America,

300
00:55:56,953 --> 00:56:01,551
they’re doing this and creating
concrete jungle for the progeny.

301
00:56:03,686 --> 00:56:06,556
Great Britain and England
and America is doing this.

302
00:56:06,561 --> 00:56:11,623
is to buy more weapons and otherwise
creating concrete jungles.

303
00:56:22,981 --> 00:56:30,265
And in Russia they say that they are giving equal distribution, but people drink like fish.

304
00:56:47,090 --> 00:56:49,405
So, with this French revolution also,

305
00:56:49,403 --> 00:56:56,575
the drinking became a part and
parcel of the lives of the French,

306
00:56:56,575 --> 00:56:59,075
because they got easy money.

307
00:57:17,058 --> 00:57:23,998
So, the more money was acquired for
doing all kinds of unrighteous things,

308
00:57:24,020 --> 00:57:29,044
unholy things and, we can
say, inauspicious things.

309
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:41,600
But there were poor people, perhaps
they did not drink so much,

310
00:57:41,617 --> 00:57:45,610
who created great architecture
here in this country.

311
00:57:54,907 --> 00:58:00,553
Despite that, great artists were born
in this country who had no money.

312
00:58:00,562 --> 00:58:06,124
They died, becoming mad
or becoming paupers.

313
00:58:22,234 --> 00:58:29,284
Now we have Napoleon, another person
who tried to conquer other places;

314
00:58:29,314 --> 00:58:33,321
he’s another ego trip that
he did in the history.

315
00:58:39,871 --> 00:58:42,591
But still he was not
a very ignoble person

316
00:58:42,591 --> 00:58:47,650
as we find so many of them are
these days, who are the rulers.

317
00:58:54,908 --> 00:59:00,440
The only thing I feel about him that
he didn’t have a great character

318
00:59:00,438 --> 00:59:04,040
to leave any great
impress on people,

319
00:59:04,040 --> 00:59:08,878
how to enhance their
life in their quality.

320
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:35,947
So, the people who could have really
impressed your minds towards the ascent

321
00:59:35,974 --> 00:59:40,157
were all paupers or became
mad or were wasted.

322
01:00:03,612 --> 01:00:16,271
Ultimately, I think the whole aggressiveness disappeared
with understanding that it is no use aggressing,

323
01:00:16,247 --> 01:00:20,771
but the left movement still
remained very prevalent.

324
01:00:37,635 --> 01:00:44,951
So, for the rest of the world, French
are very weird, queer, strange people.

325
01:00:51,620 --> 01:00:56,518
They developed their own insular
methods of dealing with things.

326
01:01:03,298 --> 01:01:10,924
This is, I would say, is a curse because that kind of a curse when it works out, then you cannot improve

327
01:01:10,924 --> 01:01:16,257
as you have nothing else to
see and relate and to advance.

328
01:01:28,792 --> 01:01:37,160
Because the ego when it is worked with the left problems, you can be very queer, strange and weird.

329
01:01:44,256 --> 01:01:49,502
I could see that the
first day I came to Paris,

330
01:01:53,826 --> 01:01:59,216
and they told Me very clearly
that, “Mother, don’t smile at all,

331
01:02:06,922 --> 01:02:09,422
and You have to keep very serious.”

332
01:02:10,874 --> 01:02:15,991
And I cannot be serious for more than
two minutes, I think, two minutes.

333
01:02:21,528 --> 01:02:24,630
So, I said, “But why?”

334
01:02:24,647 --> 01:02:28,463
 The reason, they said was that, “They
will think that You are an ignoramus,

335
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:30,313
You don’t know what’s
happening in this world:

336
01:02:30,341 --> 01:02:34,083
serious things are happening
and You are laughing.

337
01:02:41,129 --> 01:02:44,374
So, they will think that
You are not at all matured.”

338
01:02:49,754 --> 01:02:56,517
But as soon as I started My lecture, I
looked at those people who were so serious

339
01:03:05,228 --> 01:03:08,756
and I couldn’t control My laughter!

340
01:03:16,981 --> 01:03:19,481
I hope it is changing.

341
01:03:23,498 --> 01:03:26,668
And then I said,

342
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:32,248
“Sorry, I’m addressing all the les
Misérables which I have heard about."

343
01:03:40,462 --> 01:03:46,860
I am so happy to see today, that
veil of gloom, has passed over.

344
01:03:58,362 --> 01:04:02,222
As if lot of dirty mud
had gathered over here

345
01:04:02,207 --> 01:04:06,077
and the lotuses were
about to bloom out,

346
01:04:16,252 --> 01:04:19,523
whatever may be the atmosphere,
whatever may be the history,

347
01:04:19,539 --> 01:04:24,458
whatever may be that has been
created by human beings,

348
01:04:24,447 --> 01:04:33,812
inside resides beautiful lotus
petals, everything intact.

349
01:04:46,542 --> 01:04:51,097
With a little push they are
all out now in the atmosphere

350
01:04:51,123 --> 01:04:56,747
spreading their fragrance in this
dirty pool what we call as France.

351
01:05:12,037 --> 01:05:20,987
And they’re such strong people, very strong Sahaja Yogis in France which really makes Me very happy and proud.

352
01:05:32,709 --> 01:05:36,632
In the beginning I used to come
every third week to Paris

353
01:05:36,638 --> 01:05:42,532
and have a meeting and when they asked,
“Mother, why are You so much visiting Paris?”

354
01:05:42,551 --> 01:05:45,051
I said, “That is the gate of the hell.”

355
01:05:54,332 --> 01:06:01,082
You must have heard the story I’ve told
you about the advertising department.

356
01:06:07,326 --> 01:06:11,096
Ok I had better tell them.

357
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:16,480
You see, two men who had done lot
of good as Sahaja Yogis maybe,

358
01:06:16,460 --> 01:06:20,310
when they died, they were
asked to go to Heaven.

359
01:06:27,862 --> 01:06:31,772
So they went to Heaven and there they
found everybody was meditating,

360
01:06:31,772 --> 01:06:36,791
so they said, “What is new about this,
we were meditating in the world?”

361
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:50,039
So they said, “Why not we..."
They asked the permission of God,

362
01:06:50,039 --> 01:06:52,931
that, "Can we see also
Hell, if we have a chance?

363
01:06:52,930 --> 01:06:55,600
Because we... then we
can decide you see,

364
01:06:55,611 --> 01:06:58,478
whether we want to be here or there."

365
01:07:08,348 --> 01:07:10,848
You see that is what the ego
is, you must have choice.

366
01:07:16,817 --> 01:07:19,777
So they went to Hell,

367
01:07:22,290 --> 01:07:28,457
and when they entered the first big hall, they found all kind of music was going on,

368
01:07:28,497 --> 01:07:34,767
funny type of music and you know like Halloween you have all kinds of dirty things

369
01:07:34,797 --> 01:07:37,297
and women were dancing nude,

370
01:07:37,297 --> 01:07:38,987
and the men were singing nude

371
01:07:39,007 --> 01:07:42,377
and they were doing all funny, funny
things there, which we call funny.

372
01:08:02,617 --> 01:08:08,385
So, they said, “This seems to
be better place for a change,”

373
01:08:14,531 --> 01:08:18,371
because drinking was free,
everything was free there;

374
01:08:20,585 --> 01:08:23,085
drugs,

375
01:08:26,293 --> 01:08:28,793
all nice, nice things there!

376
01:08:34,624 --> 01:08:37,774
So, they said, “It's
very nice place.”

377
01:08:37,798 --> 01:08:40,888
So, the people who were in charge
said, “What are you doing here?”

378
01:08:48,638 --> 01:08:52,882
So they said, “We’ve come to visit
the Hell, where is the Hell?”

379
01:09:00,161 --> 01:09:03,741
So, they said, “You can see from this
hole”, and they took them to a hole

380
01:09:03,762 --> 01:09:06,262
from where they could
see the picture of Hell.

381
01:09:12,233 --> 01:09:15,829
And there they found people
hanging on top of fire,

382
01:09:15,832 --> 01:09:23,227
or they were put in the boiling oil
and they were put in the dirty mud;

383
01:09:23,229 --> 01:09:26,172
all kinds of things, you see,
and they were horrified.

384
01:09:37,751 --> 01:09:40,161
And some were whipped very
badly, and I don’t know,

385
01:09:40,161 --> 01:09:43,201
all kinds of punishments
that are possible.

386
01:09:46,469 --> 01:09:47,999
So, they got a fright and they said,

387
01:09:48,028 --> 01:09:51,068
“Now if that is Hell, what
is this in this hall?”

388
01:09:55,973 --> 01:10:00,591
They said, “This is the
Advertising Department of Hell.”

389
01:10:24,744 --> 01:10:29,628
And the ideas were coming from
French and English specialists,

390
01:10:29,646 --> 01:10:33,592
and other specialists from
other European countries also.

391
01:10:42,065 --> 01:10:44,922
And nowadays the Swiss must be
doing all the banking there.

392
01:10:53,396 --> 01:10:58,909
So that is the advertising
department about which,

393
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:02,879
you see, one should be quite knowledgeable,

394
01:11:02,878 --> 01:11:05,879
to know what is the advertising
department of Hell is.

395
01:11:14,673 --> 01:11:19,213
So, the righteousness and the holiness

396
01:11:19,247 --> 01:11:27,537
can only be maintained if you are very
careful about this advertising departments,

397
01:11:27,536 --> 01:11:30,782
especially in France and other countries.

398
01:11:43,847 --> 01:11:50,744
The left side works in this way
that we want to destroy ourselves,

399
01:11:54,342 --> 01:11:59,974
 because left side stands for
desire as well as for destruction.

400
01:12:03,616 --> 01:12:09,963
 It can destroy all if there
is no desire of God anymore.

401
01:12:13,895 --> 01:12:20,625
So, when you start getting to
the other side of your desires,

402
01:12:20,609 --> 01:12:23,945
you have a desire to destroy yourself.

403
01:12:32,249 --> 01:12:45,092
Yesterday only I read in a newspaper
an English lady who left millions of pounds,
killed herself by malnutrition.

404
01:12:55,308 --> 01:13:03,575
So, this idea of destroying yourself is now justifying so many things that we do in this world,

405
01:13:03,572 --> 01:13:06,212
which should not be done for our health,

406
01:13:06,214 --> 01:13:10,212
for our physical, mental and
emotional and spiritual health.

407
01:13:23,979 --> 01:13:30,455
And this tendency is to be seen by
Sahaja Yogis within themselves also.

408
01:13:36,960 --> 01:13:40,060
When the Sahaja Yogis start slipping out

409
01:13:40,070 --> 01:13:43,230
and you tell them, "You are slipping
out, now don't go that way."

410
01:13:43,247 --> 01:13:47,687
so they say, “No, leave me alone,
it’s all right, I can manage myself,”

411
01:13:47,697 --> 01:13:50,197
means, “I can destroy myself.”

412
01:14:03,038 --> 01:14:16,378
And this anti-life behaviour starts to such an extent, that they denied all that was spiritual, all that was healthy.

413
01:14:27,599 --> 01:14:32,299
Also on the left-hand side you had
some horrible writers and authors,

414
01:14:32,319 --> 01:14:33,779
who came on this earth

415
01:14:33,786 --> 01:14:38,400
to give you very, very,
very, very anti-life ideas;

416
01:14:49,072 --> 01:14:53,701
like a person like Sade, you see,
who started sadism and all that,

417
01:14:53,721 --> 01:14:56,231
this kind of people only
could prosper in France

418
01:14:56,261 --> 01:14:58,902
in India such a person
would have been thrown out.

419
01:15:05,001 --> 01:15:10,226
Some mad fellow might have written “Kama
Sutra” but I’ve never known that book,

420
01:15:10,227 --> 01:15:12,918
I’ve never read that book, I
don’t know anything about it

421
01:15:12,943 --> 01:15:16,478
and I don’t know if you ask anyone they’ll
say, “What is that book? We don’t know.”

422
01:15:31,693 --> 01:15:35,951
But if you say “Gita”, if you say “Ramayana”
you’ll find many or most of them.

423
01:15:42,778 --> 01:15:46,572
Even the Christians in India
won’t read such a book.

424
01:15:53,838 --> 01:15:58,092
Now, but these books were
very much appreciated.

425
01:15:58,083 --> 01:16:04,862
You find, it’s hard to find, anyone in Europe who’s educated and who has not read these books.

426
01:16:04,876 --> 01:16:07,376
It's like a Bible for them.

427
01:16:16,731 --> 01:16:22,377
 I mean, all these things have made
them immune to sin, the filth of sin.

428
01:16:34,545 --> 01:16:37,255
To add to problems,
you had so many wars,

429
01:16:37,255 --> 01:16:41,485
but last war, France was occupied
by these horrible Germans.

430
01:16:49,434 --> 01:16:51,934
So, they were in complete fear,

431
01:16:56,178 --> 01:16:59,692
again another left-sided movement.

432
01:17:04,758 --> 01:17:11,896
All these things have added to the
perpetuation of left sided problems.

433
01:17:18,099 --> 01:17:21,746
Now how to get rid of them is our problem.

434
01:17:25,096 --> 01:17:32,556
When I came here, Patrick told Me how they found people possessed by all kinds of variety of bhoots,

435
01:17:45,724 --> 01:17:50,846
and I’m not surprised because I was
expecting it sometimes to happen.

436
01:17:55,970 --> 01:18:01,070
There are still many Sahaja Yogis,
especially Yoginis, who are possessed.

437
01:18:08,441 --> 01:18:13,350
I know of one mad one who came to My
house, broke all the house and everything

438
01:18:13,369 --> 01:18:19,240
and did lot of things,
French, you know, a man.

439
01:18:36,703 --> 01:18:42,222
So, to get out of it, first of all
we must know the dangers of it.

440
01:18:45,041 --> 01:18:52,112
If the women go on like this, don’t obey
their leaders and go on with it, saying
that,  “This is my right”

441
01:18:52,083 --> 01:18:57,717
Don’t meditate and do all kinds of
things, they’ll become schizophrenic.

442
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:22,211
The schizophrenia, according to
Me, according to Sahaja Yoga,

443
01:19:22,212 --> 01:19:30,252
is a disease in which you are permanently
possessed by many of these dead spirits,

444
01:19:42,657 --> 01:19:47,417
and in India they would be
sent to lunatic asylums.

445
01:19:50,925 --> 01:19:58,559
But I’m told that they have now cancelled
all lunatic asylums everywhere and the
lunatics are moving on the streets.

446
01:20:07,590 --> 01:20:10,090
It’s a very serious situation.

447
01:20:12,829 --> 01:20:17,224
The government doesn’t
realise what they’re doing.

448
01:20:23,859 --> 01:20:32,497
Once I travelled by bus in Paris and I saw one after another, people, one lady, then one gentleman

449
01:20:32,507 --> 01:20:38,099
then one other gentleman, they walked in, and they were talking to themselves loudly.

450
01:20:49,597 --> 01:20:53,428
They’re all possessed people
and they’ll possess you.

451
01:21:01,335 --> 01:21:06,781
They will possess you, they will possess your children, they can possess your pets, anyone.

452
01:21:12,170 --> 01:21:16,573
Such abnormal people should
be kept away from the public.

453
01:21:21,189 --> 01:21:27,639
But Marie told Me that, “You see, these French are very sympathetic towards them.”

454
01:21:33,068 --> 01:21:42,067
Their bhoots are also, I must tell you, the left sided people, they try to do things to incur your sympathies.

455
01:21:51,959 --> 01:21:58,454
In the right-sided people, as they are
aggressive to attract your attention,

456
01:21:58,468 --> 01:22:04,084
the left-sided people are aggressive to
themselves to attract your attention.

457
01:22:19,486 --> 01:22:29,476
So those people who think, “We can wear some scanty clothes in winter time, or we can torture our lives, stand on our heads,”

458
01:22:29,445 --> 01:22:38,532
all such people are  absolutely now passing
the limits of advertising department.

459
01:22:50,452 --> 01:22:57,910
So, the first things Sahaja Yogis have to remember that you have come on this earth to enjoy.

460
01:23:08,510 --> 01:23:09,030
Enjoy.

461
01:23:09,040 --> 01:23:09,870
In French!

462
01:23:09,870 --> 01:23:11,230
No, no French!

463
01:23:13,267 --> 01:23:15,767
Difficult Shri Mataji.

464
01:23:30,105 --> 01:23:37,235
Imagine, they said there is no word in French for enjoyment as I heard today, but for fun.

465
01:23:37,255 --> 01:23:38,215
Fun!

466
01:23:38,203 --> 01:23:40,263
Fun, they've found one, Shri Mataji.

467
01:23:40,278 --> 01:23:43,233
Found, Thank God!

468
01:23:43,248 --> 01:23:48,382
So, this is fun, you have
to enjoy the fun of life,

469
01:23:53,066 --> 01:23:57,292
and you are not here
to suffer any more.

470
01:23:57,302 --> 01:23:59,592
you’re not to suffer anymore.

471
01:24:02,803 --> 01:24:06,352
And to be serious – for what?

472
01:24:15,082 --> 01:24:23,870
And to be tense is out of, out of absolutely we can say, is out of subject, is useless to be tense.

473
01:24:23,879 --> 01:24:28,360
How can you be tense in the
atmosphere which is so relaxed?

474
01:24:33,924 --> 01:24:41,874
If these things are expressing themselves, then you should know you haven’t come to your proper point in Sahaja Yoga.

475
01:24:48,675 --> 01:24:55,015
 If you still worry and go on worrying, you’ll go to the left and you’ll get out of Sahaja Yoga.

476
01:24:55,015 --> 01:24:57,515
This is the second serious point.

477
01:25:07,580 --> 01:25:14,340
So, the first point is that you’ll
become schizophrenic, mad, lunatics.

478
01:25:17,730 --> 01:25:18,768
That’s the first thing,

479
01:25:18,768 --> 01:25:21,268
I’m not a businessman so I’m
telling you the worst first.

480
01:25:38,818 --> 01:25:45,201
The second thing as just now I’ve told you will be that you’ll go out of Sahaja Yoga.

481
01:25:57,591 --> 01:26:03,695
As a result of that, you might
get any disease like cancer

482
01:26:08,307 --> 01:26:14,167
or any disease that comes from
the left side, there are so many.

483
01:26:19,415 --> 01:26:26,545
So, this is very important to see that you
try to keep to the central path of ascent,

484
01:26:35,288 --> 01:26:44,758
through curative methods, through meditative methods, through vibratory methods you must try to keep in the centre and don’t go to the right.

485
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,710
Because with this destructive power,

486
01:26:58,692 --> 01:27:02,330
with this destructive power,
if you go to the right side,

487
01:27:02,330 --> 01:27:04,110
you will become extremely inauspicious

488
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:06,620
and you’ll start destroying people,

489
01:27:12,839 --> 01:27:17,992
especially for the wives of leaders, I would like to tell them that they must become very humble,

490
01:27:18,004 --> 01:27:24,022
otherwise they will have this thing, a power by which they’ll destroy themselves and others.

491
01:27:34,989 --> 01:27:38,467
This is like this the power,
say, which is of a fire

492
01:27:38,444 --> 01:27:43,597
or of the light, if it is not
used for which it is made,

493
01:27:43,593 --> 01:27:50,046
supposing you put your hand
in the fire, it will burn,

494
01:28:01,886 --> 01:28:09,010
So, we must understand the power of
women is compassion, is nourishment,

495
01:28:15,053 --> 01:28:21,435
and they should not try to become like men, because then they’ll burn off people and burn off themselves.

496
01:28:31,532 --> 01:28:41,212
So, as I’ve told you before that it’s the women who can be very, very helpful in improving the left side.

497
01:28:47,376 --> 01:28:53,790
By dominating men, you make them left-sided which is not their style. They should not be left sided.

498
01:29:06,170 --> 01:29:11,019
But if they are truly men, they
will walk in the central path;

499
01:29:17,724 --> 01:29:22,724
and if women are truly women,
they’ll walk in the central path.

500
01:29:25,884 --> 01:29:28,484
So to walk in the central path

501
01:29:28,484 --> 01:29:30,984
one has to get rid of all these
things, of this type are within us.

502
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:48,790
The third thing that really,
I would say, warn you people,

503
01:29:48,770 --> 01:29:52,320
that you get attached to your things

504
01:29:52,324 --> 01:29:56,156
to your possessions,

505
01:30:04,595 --> 01:30:06,536
to your children,

506
01:30:07,901 --> 01:30:11,121
to your surroundings:

507
01:30:12,673 --> 01:30:17,291
like many French would say, “Oh,
I hate to go out of France.”

508
01:30:22,192 --> 01:30:26,053
When they go to some other
country they always criticise.

509
01:30:30,603 --> 01:30:35,163
I don’t know who are the best critics,
but all of them criticise each other;

510
01:30:37,629 --> 01:30:41,673
they never try to see the good points of others;

511
01:30:43,864 --> 01:30:49,517
and in doing so, what you do is to
perpetuate a kind of an inferiority on others

512
01:30:49,511 --> 01:30:56,981
using your powers of left side by
which you make others look small.

513
01:31:00,783 --> 01:31:04,523
Like pitying someone for nothing at all;

514
01:31:04,523 --> 01:31:08,013
like if supposing you start
pitying Me, what will it look like?

515
01:31:12,153 --> 01:31:14,533
 It’s absurd as that!

516
01:31:14,553 --> 01:31:17,053
Yes Shri Mataji. I don’t even
know how to translate that.

517
01:31:17,071 --> 01:31:19,571
I know, but that’s what it is.

518
01:31:44,929 --> 01:31:47,429
So there should be no pity,
there should be compassion,

519
01:31:50,197 --> 01:31:55,627
and that will take you out of this
nonsensical idea of pitying yourself,

520
01:31:55,627 --> 01:32:01,387
pitying others and feeling all
the time sorry for nothing at all;

521
01:32:06,345 --> 01:32:11,155
because if you ask for such
pity then you’ll be pitied too.

522
01:32:11,168 --> 01:32:13,668
I mean, you’ll be in a
pitiable condition yourself.

523
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:28,469
But if you have compassion, then
you don’t put down that person,

524
01:32:28,469 --> 01:32:31,999
you don’t sort of make him feel inferior

525
01:32:32,029 --> 01:32:35,769
but you encourage him
and he feels powerful.

526
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:45,180
Like a finger is hurt within you,

527
01:32:45,180 --> 01:32:49,830
you just try to soothe it and
be compassionate towards it.

528
01:32:49,822 --> 01:32:52,402
You don’t try to put him
down that “You’re no good,

529
01:32:52,403 --> 01:32:54,903
because he's part and
parcel of your being.

530
01:33:09,976 --> 01:33:14,423
So, the compassion stands in
between condemnation and pity.

531
01:33:22,509 --> 01:33:27,331
In compassion you have to
condemn whatever is wrong.

532
01:33:31,941 --> 01:33:36,553
You have to condemn the bhoots. You
have to condemn that’s ugliness’s.

533
01:33:38,471 --> 01:33:40,971
You have to condemn
all that is wrong.

534
01:33:43,454 --> 01:33:47,974
So, by that, you see,
you make that person see

535
01:33:47,964 --> 01:33:51,224
that you do not have appreciation

536
01:33:51,232 --> 01:33:56,767
of what he is at all and it is just
compassion and no pity about it;

537
01:34:07,902 --> 01:34:13,389
because the left-sided people want to be pitied and if you pity them, they get even worse.

538
01:34:24,237 --> 01:34:33,047
So, to say, “Poor person, poor man”, or
a “Poor old lady - something” is wrong.

539
01:34:41,370 --> 01:34:47,980
So when the people who are possessed
they start condemning their bhoots,

540
01:34:47,980 --> 01:34:49,935
 they come up.

541
01:35:00,465 --> 01:35:05,924
When they hate their bhoots, they
can get rid of them in no time.

542
01:35:18,050 --> 01:35:22,577
But sometimes going worse than
that, they get identified.

543
01:35:29,051 --> 01:35:32,011
Of course to judge it, best
is to see through vibrations

544
01:35:32,001 --> 01:35:35,001
but you can also see it logically,

545
01:35:35,001 --> 01:35:40,391
how we behave towards our
possessions, towards others.

546
01:35:50,655 --> 01:35:54,915
Lot of work has been done in India
on a very subtle level, I would say,

547
01:35:54,935 --> 01:35:57,795
how to get out of the left side.

548
01:36:02,937 --> 01:36:07,467
I would say Mahavira was the one
who really has worked very hard

549
01:36:07,467 --> 01:36:13,807
to give the whole idea of the hell up
to heaven, what the left side is.

550
01:36:16,202 --> 01:36:19,992
Another, I would say, his own
incarnation, was William Blake,

551
01:36:19,992 --> 01:36:22,492
who has also given full idea about it.

552
01:36:25,337 --> 01:36:27,837
I would say Dante did the same.

553
01:36:30,612 --> 01:36:33,286
So, this is what they have shown you,

554
01:36:33,286 --> 01:36:36,826
how the hell is and
how the heavens are.

555
01:36:40,651 --> 01:36:45,252
Now for Sahaja Yogis, it is important
to see their left-sided problems

556
01:36:45,244 --> 01:36:47,744
 if they are lingering in them.

557
01:36:51,324 --> 01:36:54,702
Possession means you’re
possessed by something,

558
01:36:54,683 --> 01:37:00,302
some ideas which are not
rational, which are illogical.

559
01:37:06,005 --> 01:37:10,333
And in the modern times, I’ve seen how
they avoid the topic if you ask them,

560
01:37:10,345 --> 01:37:13,143
they say, “I don’t know.”

561
01:37:18,871 --> 01:37:21,371
 “I don’t know why I feel like
that,” then give up that feeling,

562
01:37:21,371 --> 01:37:23,871
it’s wrong; if you don’t
know, it’s no good.

563
01:37:29,683 --> 01:37:34,373
In the beginning you asked French, any French, “How are you?” they would say, like this.

564
01:37:34,386 --> 01:37:39,393
And I would look at their
hands, what does that mean?

565
01:37:48,226 --> 01:37:50,726
No, like this.

566
01:37:52,947 --> 01:37:57,435
So, I used to wonder, what’s
wrong with the hand!

567
01:38:08,458 --> 01:38:13,019
And they were very boastful about
it that’s the best part of it;

568
01:38:13,003 --> 01:38:15,968
because to say something as certain, cocksure,

569
01:38:15,976 --> 01:38:18,328
was regarded as ego for them perhaps,

570
01:38:18,324 --> 01:38:21,965
but Sahaja Yogis have to be cocksure.

571
01:38:29,014 --> 01:38:34,226
Now, English, if I ask them, “How are
you?” they would say, “Confused.”

572
01:38:40,872 --> 01:38:45,592
So, I mean, I didn’t know why,
and boastingly, “I’m confused,”

573
01:38:45,592 --> 01:38:48,092
as something great, you
know that “I’m confused.”

574
01:38:52,499 --> 01:38:57,230
So, the explanation was given, was
that, that we are aware of our state,

575
01:38:57,245 --> 01:39:00,290
we are not saying something
with a cocksure way.

576
01:39:09,683 --> 01:39:13,286
A Sahaja Yogi, if he is confused,
he is not a Sahaja Yogi.

577
01:39:19,423 --> 01:39:25,290
At this stage you have to be
absolutely sure of yourself,

578
01:39:28,587 --> 01:39:35,270
sure about Me, sure about Sahaja Yoga and sure about all the Sahaja Yogis of the world.

579
01:39:40,132 --> 01:39:42,632
Otherwise you’re not Sahaja Yogis.

580
01:39:46,080 --> 01:39:56,993
That means your connection with God
is like a loose plug, like that.

581
01:40:04,827 --> 01:40:09,757
So, we have to understand that
in the centre when we are,

582
01:40:09,736 --> 01:40:14,027
 we are sure of what we
are, absolutely sure.

583
01:40:18,195 --> 01:40:20,695
We raise our heads
in pride and glory.

584
01:40:26,376 --> 01:40:30,516
We don’t have the vanity of the
right and the pity of the left.

585
01:40:35,842 --> 01:40:41,105
That’s what is we are going
to achieve in France now.

586
01:40:44,959 --> 01:40:49,085
No more going to the sub-conscious
or to the collective sub-conscious.

587
01:40:53,131 --> 01:40:55,909
Now don’t think of your
forefathers what they did,

588
01:40:58,122 --> 01:41:02,515
nor think of the future, what
your progeny’s going to do.

589
01:41:07,608 --> 01:41:11,150
Think for yourself what you’re
going to do for both of them.

590
01:41:15,421 --> 01:41:22,327
Many cursed families can be completely
redeemed by one good Sahaja Yogi;

591
01:41:29,815 --> 01:41:35,183
and thousands of years of progeny
can be blessed by one Sahaja Yogi.

592
01:41:47,376 --> 01:41:52,001
That’s a fact, you can
feel the vibrations now.

593
01:41:54,492 --> 01:41:57,062
So, one should have that personality

594
01:41:57,062 --> 01:42:02,432
of a very tranquil, peaceful, understanding,

595
01:42:09,364 --> 01:42:15,155
but this understanding should not be
mental but a sap on your central path,

596
01:42:21,993 --> 01:42:29,235
the vital energy that nourishes all the
chakras, your being and the atmosphere.

597
01:42:34,849 --> 01:42:38,689
I’m sure all the French
Sahaja Yogis now

598
01:42:38,689 --> 01:42:42,459
will take to the new ways
of the central path.

599
01:42:51,658 --> 01:42:56,332
They should wear
dresses which are fresh,

600
01:42:56,346 --> 01:43:04,406
have fresh looks on their faces, should
create a fresh atmosphere around.

601
01:43:09,640 --> 01:43:13,577
 Give up all worn-out things that,
they’re very fond of worn-out things,

602
01:43:13,577 --> 01:43:17,717
 and also worn-out houses they
like, they say it is antique.

603
01:43:21,749 --> 01:43:25,396
Worn out clothes
and worn out houses!

604
01:43:36,749 --> 01:43:41,879
No, no give up that idea of antiques also

605
01:43:41,861 --> 01:43:45,419
because, you see antiques
are not all right

606
01:43:45,402 --> 01:43:47,902
as long as they are
preserved properly,

607
01:43:47,902 --> 01:43:54,237
but if you make them look like antiques,
you see, it's no respect given to them.

608
01:44:08,539 --> 01:44:14,149
I went to Poland and I was surprised
that all their old monuments

609
01:44:14,149 --> 01:44:16,649
were resurrected after the war

610
01:44:16,637 --> 01:44:21,544
and everything is painted and
brought back to absolute fresh look.

611
01:44:28,284 --> 01:44:34,752
They haven’t kept anything broken
or muddy or in any way worn-out.

612
01:44:49,434 --> 01:44:53,558
So, the idea of this antiques to
be preserved as they are

613
01:44:53,563 --> 01:44:57,584
is also, I think, very bhootish and left-sided.

614
01:45:04,985 --> 01:45:08,955
So, your antiques whatever you may
possess also must be cleaned out

615
01:45:08,942 --> 01:45:10,645
and properly done up

616
01:45:10,650 --> 01:45:14,098
and should be brought to a fresh look.

617
01:45:29,501 --> 01:45:32,939
Now this necklace I’m wearing
is very antique, very old,

618
01:45:32,937 --> 01:45:35,437
but doesn’t look old, does it?

619
01:45:40,845 --> 01:45:44,276
Because it is looked after and it would look funny

620
01:45:44,276 --> 01:45:51,607
to wear, for a Goddess, to wear a
antique thing which looks so worn out.

621
01:46:08,209 --> 01:46:14,528
So, one criteria could be that whatever
we wear or do, will Mother like it?

622
01:46:22,477 --> 01:46:24,069
This is the one question you can ask

623
01:46:24,072 --> 01:46:30,172
if you don’t want to ask the vibrations,
“Will She like it? We have to please Her.”

624
01:46:35,243 --> 01:46:38,223
And I tell you: very small,
small things please Me.

625
01:46:41,329 --> 01:46:46,772
You don’t have to do too many things,
just a few things which pleases Me,

626
01:46:46,772 --> 01:46:49,272
which are very simple and easy and innate

627
01:46:58,817 --> 01:47:01,317
Like you have to be innocent.

628
01:47:02,508 --> 01:47:06,452
It’s very easy if you are a child-like person,

629
01:47:06,452 --> 01:47:09,592
you just don’t allow any
cunning to come into your head,

630
01:47:09,577 --> 01:47:12,689
any absurd ideas, just be innocent;

631
01:47:12,693 --> 01:47:16,263
you don’t have to do
anything to be innocent.

632
01:47:23,366 --> 01:47:25,866
You have to do something
to be non-innocent.

633
01:47:30,988 --> 01:47:33,218
So, this is what one has to understand

634
01:47:33,238 --> 01:47:37,778
that the basis of our
left side is innocence.

635
01:47:42,747 --> 01:47:45,247
So, anything that is not
innocent, we should not do.

636
01:47:49,376 --> 01:47:51,474
It's so simple.

637
01:47:52,823 --> 01:47:57,033
should be all right with all of us

638
01:47:57,033 --> 01:48:04,133
if we just believe that we have this quality
of innocence within us absolutely intact,

639
01:48:11,003 --> 01:48:15,304
and you have to just awaken
it and enjoy it, that's all.

640
01:48:21,613 --> 01:48:23,804
So may God bless you all,

641
01:48:23,804 --> 01:48:27,744
may God give you
strength to be innocent.

642
01:48:36,084 --> 01:48:40,029
You must pray that
you should be innocent

643
01:48:46,318 --> 01:48:49,908
and the innocence will
suck in all your problems,

644
01:48:49,908 --> 01:48:52,408
suck in your the problems of the left side,

645
01:48:58,443 --> 01:49:04,291
and the symbol of innocence is Shri Ganesh,
who just knows His Mother, nobody else

646
01:49:11,795 --> 01:49:15,369
and His innocence is the
source of all the wisdom.

647
01:49:17,982 --> 01:49:23,935
So, you have to pray for becoming
absolutely innocent people.

648
01:49:27,070 --> 01:49:29,570
May God bless you.

649
01:49:34,226 --> 01:49:40,696
Shri Mataji, if I may draw Your
attention on this decoration.

650
01:49:40,702 --> 01:49:46,188
On this crest is the lily who is
the symbol of ancient France,

651
01:49:46,188 --> 01:49:51,128
who represents the flower of
purity in the French tradition

652
01:49:51,161 --> 01:49:54,368
and represents the kundalini which
goes through the Agnya Chakra

653
01:49:54,368 --> 01:49:58,769
with both ego and superego being
pushed and diminished on the side.

654
01:49:58,779 --> 01:50:02,429
And we pray, Shri Mataji, that that
should be the result of our innocence

655
01:50:02,448 --> 01:50:06,669
that we should all be beautiful
French lilies for You, Shri Mataji

656
01:50:06,688 --> 01:50:07,568
Thank you.

657
01:50:07,579 --> 01:50:10,079
Jai Shri Mataji!

658
01:50:31,401 --> 01:50:38,184
Now for the Puja, ask for
Patrick, his wife and ...

659
01:50:41,436 --> 01:50:43,936
You must get some people for Puja.

660
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:52,042
Quite at length I spoke.

661
01:51:49,923 --> 01:51:53,913
All right, now we should get the
children to wash My Feet. It's the best

662
01:51:53,903 --> 01:51:56,403
Have you got warm water?

663
01:52:08,969 --> 01:52:11,469
Ah, come along.That's very few.

664
01:52:16,199 --> 01:52:18,699
Four say, at a time.

665
01:52:24,075 --> 01:52:27,925
No, start it from younger
to the eldest. Younger!

666
01:52:38,489 --> 01:52:40,989
Four of them, youngest.

667
01:53:06,051 --> 01:53:08,551
Who got you this nice dress?

668
01:53:14,952 --> 01:53:16,553
Her mummy bought it.

669
01:53:17,675 --> 01:53:20,423
Oh, that's great.

670
01:53:20,453 --> 01:53:22,676
Now can you move this side?

671
01:53:22,676 --> 01:53:25,496
Now what you have to do is
to pour water from there.

672
01:53:25,495 --> 01:53:27,995
Will you guide the
children how to wash it.

673
01:53:27,995 --> 01:53:30,495
Can you bring the hot water here?

674
01:53:34,960 --> 01:53:37,460
Nice lecture on that. It was good.

675
01:53:37,460 --> 01:53:42,280
The left side will be clearing
out. It's quite clear now.

676
01:53:47,970 --> 01:53:53,250
Now, who will say the mantra of the Ganesha?

677
01:53:54,553 --> 01:53:57,845
You can't say it in English?
Warren you can say it in English.

678
01:53:57,869 --> 01:54:00,369
Have you got it written out?

679
01:54:13,825 --> 01:54:16,325
What's he saying?

680
03:23:56,369 --> 03:23:58,869
May God bless you all.

681
03:24:04,923 --> 03:24:07,423
May God bless you.

682
03:25:11,872 --> 03:25:14,372
Shri Mataji would like...

683
03:25:21,844 --> 03:25:29,315
Shri Mataji will let this bird
fly free when She will leave the room.

684
03:26:14,172 --> 03:26:19,932
Shri Mataji we tried to find some present
for You and then we had this story.

685
03:26:19,932 --> 03:26:27,920
When we have been looking (unclear)....
imagine we get no "made in France."

686
03:26:27,925 --> 03:26:35,210
and we've been so pleased with the
music that the Swiss Sahaja yogis

687
03:26:35,230 --> 03:26:41,969
could play for you. This Music
Box is coming from Switzerland.

688
03:27:49,983 --> 03:27:52,483
What an idea!

689
03:27:59,440 --> 03:28:01,940
You can all hear it?

690
03:28:07,138 --> 03:28:09,638
Beautiful!

691
03:28:12,404 --> 03:28:14,904
Very nice! Very fine one!

692
03:28:19,604 --> 03:28:21,818
It is made in Switzerland?

693
03:28:21,818 --> 03:28:23,148
Yes Mother.

694
03:28:26,237 --> 03:28:28,737
They make something nice also.

695
03:28:34,435 --> 03:28:36,935
Thank you very much..

696
03:28:51,331 --> 03:28:57,971
For the second present Mother, we still
catch because it was not made in France.

697
03:28:57,974 --> 03:29:01,551
Swiss give us the desire

698
03:29:01,561 --> 03:29:05,594
to sing and to play music for you

699
03:29:05,599 --> 03:29:12,826
and in Italy, they give us the
desire to be sweet with our Mother

700
03:29:12,839 --> 03:29:19,819
and this present for Your new
house, is made in Italy.

701
03:29:51,258 --> 03:29:53,758
Beautiful!

702
03:29:56,460 --> 03:29:58,960
Very beautiful.

703
03:30:01,921 --> 03:30:04,421
Very beautiful!

704
03:30:05,629 --> 03:30:07,689
Thank you very much.

705
03:30:07,692 --> 03:30:11,799
It's very thoughtful,

706
03:30:11,814 --> 03:30:18,324
because I've seen that you have appreciated.

707
03:30:18,338 --> 03:30:22,304
I was actually appreciating this
kind of work on the cotton

708
03:30:22,304 --> 03:30:28,024
and they should remember
and... really remarkable!

709
03:30:33,621 --> 03:30:36,121
Here is a present for all the yogis.

710
03:30:36,674 --> 03:30:40,661
Instead of the usual picture it's a song booklet.

711
03:31:09,956 --> 03:31:14,327
The booklet that Mother is
reading now, is a song booklet,

712
03:31:14,327 --> 03:31:19,328
that will be offered to you
from the French Sahaja Yogis,

713
03:31:19,359 --> 03:31:22,468
to thank you for  your coming here today.

714
03:31:31,092 --> 03:31:36,028
Shri Mataji, this is the
booklet, that we have prepared

715
03:31:36,032 --> 03:31:38,532
 for the newcomers in Sahaja Yoga

716
03:31:39,483 --> 03:31:40,333
Oh, very good

717
03:31:40,368 --> 03:31:42,993
to give them at the Public
Programmes and the follow ups.

718
03:31:49,120 --> 03:31:51,620
I must tell you a little story.

719
03:31:51,627 --> 03:32:01,217
We got Mother, the two cards that have been made in the same time and we had a little problem with printing, but just look at the result.

720
03:32:01,217 --> 03:32:07,164
The result is that there is this red line coming out of the feet of Shri Ganesh

721
03:32:07,170 --> 03:32:09,490
and they are coming out of Your Feet.

722
03:32:09,490 --> 03:32:11,990
Which red line?

723
03:32:14,392 --> 03:32:18,340
Ah that's good!

724
03:32:18,375 --> 03:32:21,550
The vibrations are coming.

725
03:32:21,548 --> 03:32:24,048
So beautiful!

726
03:32:52,460 --> 03:32:56,910
this cushion has been made by
all the Paris Sahaja Yoginis,

727
03:32:56,923 --> 03:33:02,043
Everyone of them, just made a
little piece of it for You, Mother.

728
03:33:12,853 --> 03:33:17,693
Shri Mataji for the Public Programme
we've made this Press Booklet

729
03:33:17,726 --> 03:33:20,516
 and we hope, with Your help, that

730
03:33:20,496 --> 03:33:26,986
journalists will come and have
their normal job they have to do.

731
03:33:53,822 --> 03:33:56,322
Very nice!

732
03:34:22,342 --> 03:34:30,042
Mother, we have some ... vineyard plant.

733
03:34:32,214 --> 03:34:36,887
So that no wine can grow in France
any more, only grape juice.

734
03:34:36,887 --> 03:34:42,629
Only grape juice in France,
in Italy and in Spain!

735
03:35:16,844 --> 03:35:20,816
Here is a present from
Alsace Sahaja Yogis, Mother.

736
03:35:46,446 --> 03:35:53,345
Shri Mataji I saw so many Sahaja Yogi children have a little present for you.

737
03:35:53,346 --> 03:35:57,116
The children have a lot of presents
for you, a lot of drawings.

738
03:35:57,116 --> 03:36:02,046
You can say they are presents,
the children are the best presents.

739
03:36:02,914 --> 03:36:05,414
Look at them.

740
03:36:55,812 --> 03:37:00,340
On the cloth is written in
Marathi, Jai Shri Mataji.

741
03:37:43,851 --> 03:37:49,581
All of them have done a good
job. Very beautiful integrated job!

742
03:37:49,573 --> 03:37:55,369
Mother, everyone expects You  in Colmar for this seminar and You were there on vibrations.

743
03:37:55,369 --> 03:38:03,045
and we get this little souvenir
from Colmar Seminar for you.

744
03:38:15,078 --> 03:38:17,578
 Made in France.

745
03:38:17,578 --> 03:38:20,078
Yes, hand made in Alsace.

746
03:38:20,963 --> 03:38:23,463
From that place only.

747
03:38:24,369 --> 03:38:26,869
Thank you very much.

748
03:38:39,589 --> 03:38:41,479
It is from where?

749
03:38:41,477 --> 03:38:44,529
Present from Montpellier, Mother.

750
03:38:44,539 --> 03:38:47,889
Thank you. They're all
doing such a good job.

751
03:38:49,164 --> 03:38:51,664
Please open for Me.

752
03:38:57,441 --> 03:39:01,114
I'm sorry I won't be able to
come, but may be later on.

753
03:39:01,114 --> 03:39:04,324
I might try but just now I don't think.

754
03:39:07,707 --> 03:39:10,207
Everyday I'm booked now.

755
03:39:15,230 --> 03:39:17,730
Oh what a beauty!

756
03:39:22,068 --> 03:39:24,568
It's a shawl! What a beauty!

757
03:39:25,195 --> 03:39:27,098
A shawl.

758
03:39:42,296 --> 03:39:44,796
It is lovely!

759
03:39:50,831 --> 03:39:53,331
Just look! The  symbol of kundalini.

760
03:40:03,136 --> 03:40:05,486
Very nice, delicate and beautifully done.

761
03:40:05,486 --> 03:40:07,986
Kundalini is that beautiful.

762
03:40:33,168 --> 03:40:35,668
Still on? How many things?

763
03:40:35,662 --> 03:40:40,278
I'll have to take one box again.

764
03:40:46,143 --> 03:40:48,273
I can see.  It's beautiful!

765
03:40:48,293 --> 03:40:50,793
Done with hands?

766
03:40:50,803 --> 03:40:54,273
Thank you very much. Who's
brought this? From whom?

767
03:40:59,321 --> 03:41:01,171
Very beautiful.

768
03:41:01,161 --> 03:41:03,151
Thank you very much,
I'll always use it.

769
03:41:03,151 --> 03:41:08,390
See this is made hearts here. All hearts,
hearts, hearts, of all the Sahaja Yogis!

770
03:41:08,401 --> 03:41:12,422
I can always use it in my travelling also. It's beautiful!

771
03:41:43,188 --> 03:41:45,688
Very beautiful, very beautiful!

772
03:41:46,790 --> 03:41:49,290
Oh thank you.  From whom?

773
03:41:49,290 --> 03:41:51,790
From the children, in the
name of all the children.

774
03:41:58,116 --> 03:41:59,439
All the children.

775
03:41:59,449 --> 03:42:04,799
There are two of those Mother.
The first one was under the music box.

776
03:42:04,799 --> 03:42:06,279
This is the second one.

777
03:42:06,282 --> 03:42:08,782
From the children is the sweet one.

778
03:42:08,782 --> 03:42:11,282
Thank you.

779
03:42:16,092 --> 03:42:17,572
This one, from whom?

780
03:42:24,814 --> 03:42:25,782
Sweets!

781
03:42:27,861 --> 03:42:30,361
It's very good for the throat,

782
03:42:34,331 --> 03:42:35,371
Thank you very much.

783
03:42:36,480 --> 03:42:38,256
From whom?

784
03:42:38,280 --> 03:42:39,196
From Nantes.

785
03:42:49,185 --> 03:42:51,052
Shri Mataji , Nicola!

786
03:42:51,883 --> 03:42:54,383
A little present for you Mother.

787
03:42:59,195 --> 03:43:00,515
Everybody giving me things.

788
03:43:00,535 --> 03:43:02,065
Now this is too much.

789
03:43:02,041 --> 03:43:04,541
It's too much to give. This is too much.

790
03:43:04,552 --> 03:43:07,475
She is hiding behind her baby, Shri Mataji.

791
03:43:09,685 --> 03:43:12,185
This is too much.

792
03:43:27,950 --> 03:43:32,290
Now just see, I'm not supposed to take anything. I'm 'Asang.'

793
03:43:32,295 --> 03:43:35,099
The One Who dosen't take anything from anyone.

794
03:43:35,120 --> 03:43:37,199
It already belongs to You Shri Mataji

795
03:43:37,199 --> 03:43:41,469
so You don't think in that way.

796
03:44:05,862 --> 03:44:07,426
How beautiful!

797
03:44:15,707 --> 03:44:18,207
Thank you very much.

798
03:44:20,574 --> 03:44:23,074
Let the children bring their paintings.

799
03:45:07,488 --> 03:45:09,988
Such talent I think!

800
03:45:41,588 --> 03:45:44,088
See the joy!

801
03:46:17,922 --> 03:46:20,652
Is it a future ashram for France?

802
03:46:20,652 --> 03:46:22,972
I think so!

803
03:46:23,002 --> 03:46:25,502
They are expressive.

804
03:46:50,620 --> 03:46:53,820
This must be kept for
exhibitions when we have.

805
03:46:53,810 --> 03:46:57,910
You see children's paintings be kept
for the exhibitions when we have.

806
03:46:57,933 --> 03:47:00,433
It would be nice, but I hope they
have written the names or not.

807
03:47:01,726 --> 03:47:04,376
Have you written the names?

808
03:47:05,650 --> 03:47:08,150
No, no you'd better
write and your age also.

809
03:47:28,792 --> 03:47:31,292
So thank you very much.

810
03:47:34,150 --> 03:47:41,420
Six months ago, two people from Australia
went to a country called Sierra Leone.

811
03:47:41,410 --> 03:47:43,370
As this is a French Puja,

812
03:47:43,366 --> 03:47:45,610
this is an appropriate
time to present Mother

813
03:47:45,610 --> 03:47:48,936
for the symbol of what
has been started there

814
03:47:48,950 --> 03:47:54,970
already there are 21 Sahaja Yogis, African
Sahaja Yogis, established in Sierra Leone.

815
03:48:47,640 --> 03:48:50,140
I say that it is appropriate that
this should be announced in France

816
03:48:50,140 --> 03:48:52,937
which has a special
relationship with Africa.

817
03:48:52,927 --> 03:48:57,840
 Probably for the left
swadisthan Shri Mataji.

818
03:49:01,477 --> 03:49:05,254
But we are starting from the
roots so we will be all right.

819
03:49:47,662 --> 03:49:50,162
Ah! There's another one.

820
03:49:50,165 --> 03:49:52,665
Oh, beautiful this one is! Very beautiful.

821
03:50:10,404 --> 03:50:12,904
Oh beautiful! such a nice thing.
