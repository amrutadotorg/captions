00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.480
Now, let’s understand the significance, all right?

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.060
Now, he said a word ‘Swaha’.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:31.080
‘Swaha’ is the capacity of the Nabhi Chakra.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.600
That is – it burns everything.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:42.340
The capacity! You can say ‘the essence’.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.400
It burns up everything. Whatever you put into the fire, it burns up.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:53.360
That’s one. Second it purifies.

00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:01.100
Say, if you have got mixed up gold

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:05.840
and you put it in the fire, it cleanses.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.500
It burns something, it does not burn something – discrimination.

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:17.000
It has got discrimination.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.840
It has got brilliance.

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:28.020
Fire also has another great capacity,

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:31.660
that it goes against the gravity.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.920
And when it goes against the gravity,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:45.380
it suggests that there can be another energy that can go against the gravity and that is the Kundalini.

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:51.080
Many people confused with Kundalini the Prana Shakti.

00:05:51.440 --> 00:06:00.920
They thought, because Prana Shakti is the child of fire.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:08.060
They could only relate it to Kundalini.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.360
They thought that Kundalini and Prana Shakti are the same,

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:18.460
because Kundalini also goes against the gravity.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:25.940
Then it has capacity to give you brilliance.

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:33.840
A person who do this fire can use it to polishing things into brilliant,

00:06:34.180 --> 00:06:36.980
to its brilliance.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:42.900
It has capacity to join by melting.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:48.400
Like human beings are like steel, worse than that sometimes.

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.540
Alright? They could be.

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:56.820
Then it is this fire in a subtle way,

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.520
Swaha,

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:05.000
melts their heart and joins them.

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:14.080
So the significance of fire is expressed here, and that’s why fire is worshipped.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:19.480
Fire has been worshipped since very, very long time

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:26.540
by many gurus, prophets – they worshipped fire.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.800
And the essence of it was that we should have the quality of fire.

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:39.640
Now, when the saints like you invoke the fire,

00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:42.920
you invoke the essence of fire.

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:45.780
Essence of fire is ‘Swaha’.

00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:52.080
And this essence of fire gives you all the subtle qualities of the fire.

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:57.020
First of all, it burns away your negativity.

00:07:57.420 --> 00:08:03.480
You have seen that on the photograph when you have a candle

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:09.780
and if there are negative forces it flickers, it dances.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000
Because of you and My photograph

00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.660
the fire of the candle has been enlightened.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:26.400
Sort of it has reached this ‘Swaha’ stage. Where it is Swaha it assumes it’s Swaha stage.

00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.200
And when it assumes its ‘Swaha’ stage then it burns.

00:08:31.200 --> 00:08:37.280
Normally, no fire can burn, you know that, but you have seen it, it happened.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:47.600
Then the fire in the stomach, that is within us, when it is enlightened,

00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:52.900
then it enlightens our attention.

00:08:53.860 --> 00:09:01.980
We get a capacity to rise against gravity that is [Maha Shakti ? ].

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:12.720
Then we understand the discrimination that the fire does that it burns certain things and it not burns certain things.

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.740
When we have that capacity we also discriminate, we know.

00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:27.360
It also has got [tages], it has got light, it gives you a face which is brilliant, which is shining,

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:36.200
and also gives your eyes a capacity to see right things at right places.

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.520
Eyes become brilliant

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:44.780
and when in the eyes this fire is enlightened,

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:46.780
there is a glint in your eyes.

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:54.440
Sahaja Yogis have a glint in their eyes, always shining, like a joking, like, you can say, a flame.

00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:09.700
And you can go on adding to it and it can go on working.

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:15.700
The food is digested by this fire within us.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:25.860
But when an enlightened person digests his food, then whatever is produced out of that fire becomes Shuddha, means it becomes pure.

00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:30.680
When you vibrate the food and eat it, it goes in the stomach

00:10:30.680 --> 00:10:37.880
and makes the fire of the stomach that ‘Swaha Shakti’, that Swaha power.

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:45.800
And then this power makes the food act like a medicine in your stomach.

00:10:47.320 --> 00:10:49.560
That’s why we put vibrations in what we eat,

00:10:49.660 --> 00:10:56.660
because once it goes in the stomach, it will excite that Swaha power within us.

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:04.980
Like this, all the powers of the fire, which are good powers,

00:11:04.980 --> 00:11:08.520
whatever are auspicious are good powers,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:10.520
the good side of it,

00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:16.800
they get enlightened, awakened and they [...].That’s why Havana is there..

00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.820
So this is the Nabhi chakra

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:23.900
and we are putting everything to the universal Nabhi.

00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:34.300
So that It uses its discretion, burns off all this which is bad,

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:38.340
then it clears the atmosphere

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:43.640
by throwing it’s flames around,

00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:49.080
by charging the atmosphere with its capacities

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:54.840
– or say the atmosphere ether

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:57.020
– is Akasha.

00:11:57.020 --> 00:12:01.880
It also has got its subtle being.

00:12:01.880 --> 00:12:08.000
It excites the Akasha, the Akasha also gets cleared out. The atmosphere is cleared out.

00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:12.720
All the Bhoots and Badhas and Pisachhas run away, all negativity runs away.

00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.140
All lethargy, inertia go out.

00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:23.940
It excites also the [GwanasPati ] that is there,

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000
the vegetation,

00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:32.380
plants, animals.

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.600
Every sort of thing that exists, whatever has created [Buddha].

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:42.540
Whatever has created has been enlightened by this fire.

00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:48.300
But of course it depends on your capacity also to excite the fire.

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.640
How much you can excite that fire is very much important.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.480
Supposing you are an impure personality

00:12:55.640 --> 00:13:00.260
and you are not yet there, your link with the divine is poor,

00:13:00.260 --> 00:13:04.260
you are a doubting Tomas, for example, or some of them are suspicious,

00:13:04.260 --> 00:13:06.480
all nonsensical cases.

00:13:06.480 --> 00:13:08.180
They can’t do this.

00:13:08.180 --> 00:13:17.860
Only a person, who is a realized soul and who has given realization to many people, works it out better.

00:13:17.860 --> 00:13:22.940
So, all those who are sitting here must remember that the responsibility is very great in that [place].

00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:27.700
Just now, put all you nonsensical doubts on one side and, please, work it out.

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:34.000
Otherwise if you cannot do it, you better give up, because it’s like a dog in the manger, as I told you.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:37.760
You can’t do it, you don’t want others to do it. It’s no proper.

00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:41.800
At least let others do it, because we want atmosphere to clear out.

00:13:41.800 --> 00:13:47.320
We want everybody to be helped, we want Sahaja Yoga to be established, we want the emancipation of human beings,

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.440
we want peace to descend, we want blessings of God to come.

00:13:52.440 --> 00:14:01.660
Those who don’t want to do it or think that they are doubtful, they should not do it. Absolutely frankly they should not do it.

00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:10.020
Because they don’t realize just now. They will doing when they realize. It’s a very open offer to all of you

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:15.040
not to feel insulted or bad, but to do it with your heart. If you cannot do it, you should not do it,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:19.020
because this is a very great tusk we have taken over, it’s a tremendous tusk.

00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:25.180
Is not just having some people around you and having a big show, it’s a very deep tusk

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:31.640
and those who are capable of doing it, should only do it otherwise they spoil the game.

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:35.040
First of all, we always worship Shri Ganesha,

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.340
who came as our Lord Jesus Christ on this earth.

00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:45.200
Because He is the Vignanashaka, He is the one who takes out all the perils

00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:50.420
that can come to this deep work.

00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:06.940
Nobody has authority to do Havana unless and until they are the Brahmins, means the ones who [..] you can’t do it.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:10.260
One develop lots of problems.

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.180
All right! So now this is the beginning.

00:16:02.180 --> 00:16:08.000
Do it very carefully. You have to put it round because you are realized souls, you have your own powers.

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:16.760
When you put it round, what you do, you give a Bandhan yourself, and whatever is there within you, goes into it and you put it.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:24.980
So the fire discriminately does everything. It solves all the problems at one time.

00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:31.400
It burns off whatever is bad, it gives you whatever is good.

00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:37.980
It will establish the gold in you, it will give you the lustre, everything works out simultaneously.

00:16:37.980 --> 00:16:42.760
But you have to awaken the subtleness, for that you have to be sublte yourself.

00:16:42.900 --> 00:16:48.100
If you are gross and if you are mundane, and if you are on that level,

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:53.760
then rather difficult. You can understand that. You have to have the level.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.580
Alright. Let's do it.

00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:22.720
Now, you have to say ‘Agni Devta’, because ‘Agni Devta’ is the one, which is ‘Swaha’ and you have to say about other Devata.

00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.780
See, Agni as I told you is the seeking, all right? Is the water.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:05.060
Now, today you are going to do Devi’s names, means that is the desire.

00:19:05.060 --> 00:19:08.400
The most powerful thing is Devi’s names.

00:19:08.400 --> 00:19:14.840
What you are doing, is to now trying to purify your desires – the basics, absolutely,

00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:20.360
where you have to return after all. So, that’s what you have trying to do.

00:19:20.360 --> 00:19:25.500
But supposing you want to have more [ascent], then you should do Brahmadeva Saraswati.

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.380
Now if you want to have more evolution – Vishnu.

00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:41.840
We are quite evolved, but I find a gap between the others, so let us create more desires, all right?

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:48.380
Because if we only evolve, only we few will left in the air, the rest will be all not belonging.

00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:51.660
Take the Vedas, look where they are (people laughing).

00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:56.620
We have to work it out, they are all blind people.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:59.120
They don’t understand. We have to go slow

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:06.640
and to make it slow and to make them come up, this is the Puja we are doing to desire.

00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:09.180
Mahakali Puja to desire,

00:20:09.180 --> 00:20:12.940
is the Devis Puja, the primordial Mother, Adi Shaktis Pujas is there,

00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:17.060
that, so the Desire is created.

00:21:14.180 --> 00:21:18.020
See, it doesn’t burn. It’s a living thing. It doesn’t burn it.

00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:51.420
What you have in your hand, all the fragrant things from various sources, are meant to be put there fragrance of the Mother Earth,

00:21:51.420 --> 00:22:05.180
and put fragrance for this fire. So, it burns away all that is nonsensical and keeps the fragrance and makes the whole atmosphere fragrant.

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:09.060
Fragrance is the essence of Mother Earth.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:16.860
The ‘Bhoo’ – that is called as the ‘Bhoo’ – but is the fragrance, causal.

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.320
First of all when it is better, ....

00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:30.700
So, first we are going to say a few names of Shiva.

00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:48.940
For Shiva you need not do it. [...] But Now just now we will do it. The names you can do.

00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:54.500
This is the gold we have to do. You have to burn ourselves, because Shiva is Sadashiva.

00:22:54.500 --> 00:22:57.300
What is there to burn anything?

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.540
This is the spirit.[....]

00:23:23.240 --> 00:23:32.380
A yogi recites the names in a row (without ‘swaha’).

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:20.520
Virata-Atma, see! The Virata. It resides in the heart. See the relationship.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:49.600
Chit Agni. This is Chit Agni. Agni ok? Attention.

00:54:20.780 --> 00:54:27.220
I thought of the...this is digestion - is the Swaha, is to digest.

00:54:27.220 --> 00:54:31.980
That’s what you get with the word digest, is better Swaha – that digest,

00:54:31.980 --> 00:54:37.660
whatever is good for the body, it turns out to do the best.

00:54:37.660 --> 00:54:41.440
All right? Whatever is not needed, it burns.

00:54:41.440 --> 00:54:45.960
You can say Swaha is actually digestion, digestive power.

00:54:45.960 --> 00:54:49.760
Swaha is a digestive power of fire, is Swaha.

00:54:49.760 --> 00:54:51.500
Void. It is all void.

00:54:54.620 --> 00:54:59.440
Intestines, liver, everything...Liver also sorts all your poisons.

00:55:03.620 --> 00:55:07.900
Kidneys also [ ] out whichever is wrong.

00:55:07.900 --> 00:55:09.500
So, that’s what it is.

00:55:09.500 --> 00:55:12.440
Retention of the good and the expulsion of the bad.

00:55:23.660 --> 00:55:28.180
All this people worship fire for the same reason.

00:55:32.840 --> 00:55:43.440
These are all Viveka – attention, to the Angi again. The Agni, the fire of your Chitta. You see, when it gets enlightened it becomes Chitta.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:49.020
That’s why when – I cannot explain why, how I do these things, because Mine is Chita Shakti.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.740
First you have to become ‘Chitti’ and then Chitti Shakti.

00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:54.860
So, this is a little gap in between.

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:11.440
Means the Agni, means in the Chitta whatever you put into an enlightened persons Chitta, he knows how to sort out.

00:56:12.760 --> 00:56:14.520
Chit Agni.

00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:24.620
without the baddhas?

00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:29.000
10 names of Guru is good...

00:57:50.060 --> 00:57:58.180
That is the Guru Shakti also, because only if you have the Guru Shakti you can discriminate. You know who to burn out.

00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.280
Now, for example Rajneesh was burned by fire.

00:58:15.280 --> 00:58:17.740
Fire means that settle.

00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:25.500
Ahankara can be burned by fire. So many things can be.

00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:45.880
And you appear like - even these flames you see – actually your Chakras appear like this, only like flames, but they’re very silent,
