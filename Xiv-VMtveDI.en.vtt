WEBVTT

04:05.440 --> 04:10.480
Now, let’s understand the significance, all right?

04:21.180 --> 04:25.060
Now, he said a word ‘Swaha’.

04:25.280 --> 04:31.080
‘Swaha’ is the capacity of the Nabhi Chakra.

04:31.400 --> 04:34.600
That is – it burns everything.

04:35.960 --> 04:42.340
The capacity! You can say ‘the essence’.

04:42.780 --> 04:48.400
It burns up everything. Whatever you put into the fire, it burns up.

04:48.740 --> 04:53.360
That’s one. Second it purifies.

04:53.540 --> 05:01.100
Say, if you have got mixed up gold

05:01.540 --> 05:05.840
and you put it in the fire, it cleanses.

05:06.660 --> 05:13.500
It burns something, it does not burn something – discrimination.

05:14.100 --> 05:17.000
It has got discrimination.

05:17.460 --> 05:20.840
It has got brilliance.

05:22.800 --> 05:28.020
Fire also has another great capacity,

05:28.280 --> 05:31.660
that it goes against the gravity.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.920
And when it goes against the gravity,

05:38.300 --> 05:45.380
it suggests that there can be another energy that can go against the gravity and that is the Kundalini.

05:45.380 --> 05:51.080
Many people confused with Kundalini the Prana Shakti.

05:51.440 --> 06:00.920
They thought, because Prana Shakti is the child of fire.

06:02.080 --> 06:08.060
They could only relate it to Kundalini.

06:08.060 --> 06:12.360
They thought that Kundalini and Prana Shakti are the same,

06:12.500 --> 06:18.460
because Kundalini also goes against the gravity.

06:19.000 --> 06:25.940
Then it has capacity to give you brilliance.

06:26.880 --> 06:33.840
A person who do this fire can use it to polishing things into brilliant,

06:34.180 --> 06:36.980
to its brilliance.

06:37.720 --> 06:42.900
It has capacity to join by melting.

06:43.260 --> 06:48.400
Like human beings are like steel, worse than that sometimes.

06:48.400 --> 06:51.540
Alright? They could be.

06:51.740 --> 06:56.820
Then it is this fire in a subtle way,

06:57.600 --> 06:59.520
Swaha,

06:59.520 --> 07:05.000
melts their heart and joins them.

07:06.840 --> 07:14.080
So the significance of fire is expressed here, and that’s why fire is worshipped.

07:14.260 --> 07:19.480
Fire has been worshipped since very, very long time

07:19.660 --> 07:26.540
by many gurus, prophets – they worshipped fire.

07:27.760 --> 07:34.800
And the essence of it was that we should have the quality of fire.

07:34.900 --> 07:39.640
Now, when the saints like you invoke the fire,

07:39.780 --> 07:42.920
you invoke the essence of fire.

07:43.020 --> 07:45.780
Essence of fire is ‘Swaha’.

07:45.800 --> 07:52.080
And this essence of fire gives you all the subtle qualities of the fire.

07:52.340 --> 07:57.020
First of all, it burns away your negativity.

07:57.420 --> 08:03.480
You have seen that on the photograph when you have a candle

08:03.780 --> 08:09.780
and if there are negative forces it flickers, it dances.

08:10.000 --> 08:15.000
Because of you and My photograph

08:15.500 --> 08:18.660
the fire of the candle has been enlightened.

08:19.180 --> 08:26.400
Sort of it has reached this ‘Swaha’ stage. Where it is Swaha it assumes it’s Swaha stage.

08:26.840 --> 08:31.200
And when it assumes its ‘Swaha’ stage then it burns.

08:31.200 --> 08:37.280
Normally, no fire can burn, you know that, but you have seen it, it happened.

08:37.880 --> 08:47.600
Then the fire in the stomach, that is within us, when it is enlightened,

08:47.980 --> 08:52.900
then it enlightens our attention.

08:53.860 --> 09:01.980
We get a capacity to rise against gravity that is [Maha Shakti ? ].

09:04.800 --> 09:12.720
Then we understand the discrimination that the fire does that it burns certain things and it not burns certain things.

09:12.840 --> 09:18.740
When we have that capacity we also discriminate, we know.

09:18.840 --> 09:27.360
It also has got [tages], it has got light, it gives you a face which is brilliant, which is shining,

09:28.040 --> 09:36.200
and also gives your eyes a capacity to see right things at right places.

09:36.580 --> 09:38.520
Eyes become brilliant

09:38.820 --> 09:44.780
and when in the eyes this fire is enlightened,

09:44.820 --> 09:46.780
there is a glint in your eyes.

09:46.780 --> 09:54.440
Sahaja Yogis have a glint in their eyes, always shining, like a joking, like, you can say, a flame.

09:59.300 --> 10:09.700
And you can go on adding to it and it can go on working.

10:10.080 --> 10:15.700
The food is digested by this fire within us.

10:15.840 --> 10:25.860
But when an enlightened person digests his food, then whatever is produced out of that fire becomes Shuddha, means it becomes pure.

10:25.940 --> 10:30.680
When you vibrate the food and eat it, it goes in the stomach

10:30.680 --> 10:37.880
and makes the fire of the stomach that ‘Swaha Shakti’, that Swaha power.

10:38.180 --> 10:45.800
And then this power makes the food act like a medicine in your stomach.

10:47.320 --> 10:49.560
That’s why we put vibrations in what we eat,

10:49.660 --> 10:56.660
because once it goes in the stomach, it will excite that Swaha power within us.

10:58.040 --> 11:04.980
Like this, all the powers of the fire, which are good powers,

11:04.980 --> 11:08.520
whatever are auspicious are good powers,

11:08.520 --> 11:10.520
the good side of it,

11:10.520 --> 11:16.800
they get enlightened, awakened and they [...].That’s why Havana is there..

11:16.960 --> 11:19.820
So this is the Nabhi chakra

11:19.820 --> 11:23.900
and we are putting everything to the universal Nabhi.

11:24.040 --> 11:34.300
So that It uses its discretion, burns off all this which is bad,

11:34.840 --> 11:38.340
then it clears the atmosphere

11:38.540 --> 11:43.640
by throwing it’s flames around,

11:43.680 --> 11:49.080
by charging the atmosphere with its capacities

11:49.240 --> 11:54.840
– or say the atmosphere ether

11:54.840 --> 11:57.020
– is Akasha.

11:57.020 --> 12:01.880
It also has got its subtle being.

12:01.880 --> 12:08.000
It excites the Akasha, the Akasha also gets cleared out. The atmosphere is cleared out.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.720
All the Bhoots and Badhas and Pisachhas run away, all negativity runs away.

12:12.780 --> 12:16.140
All lethargy, inertia go out.

12:16.140 --> 12:23.940
It excites also the [GwanasPati ] that is there,

12:25.000 --> 12:29.000
the vegetation,

12:30.140 --> 12:32.380
plants, animals.

12:32.480 --> 12:36.600
Every sort of thing that exists, whatever has created [Buddha].

12:36.600 --> 12:42.540
Whatever has created has been enlightened by this fire.

12:42.980 --> 12:48.300
But of course it depends on your capacity also to excite the fire.

12:48.300 --> 12:51.640
How much you can excite that fire is very much important.

12:51.640 --> 12:55.480
Supposing you are an impure personality

12:55.640 --> 13:00.260
and you are not yet there, your link with the divine is poor,

13:00.260 --> 13:04.260
you are a doubting Tomas, for example, or some of them are suspicious,

13:04.260 --> 13:06.480
all nonsensical cases.

13:06.480 --> 13:08.180
They can’t do this.

13:08.180 --> 13:17.860
Only a person, who is a realized soul and who has given realization to many people, works it out better.

13:17.860 --> 13:22.940
So, all those who are sitting here must remember that the responsibility is very great in that [place].

13:22.940 --> 13:27.700
Just now, put all you nonsensical doubts on one side and, please, work it out.

13:27.700 --> 13:34.000
Otherwise if you cannot do it, you better give up, because it’s like a dog in the manger, as I told you.

13:34.000 --> 13:37.760
You can’t do it, you don’t want others to do it. It’s no proper.

13:37.760 --> 13:41.800
At least let others do it, because we want atmosphere to clear out.

13:41.800 --> 13:47.320
We want everybody to be helped, we want Sahaja Yoga to be established, we want the emancipation of human beings,

13:47.340 --> 13:52.440
we want peace to descend, we want blessings of God to come.

13:52.440 --> 14:01.660
Those who don’t want to do it or think that they are doubtful, they should not do it. Absolutely frankly they should not do it.

14:01.760 --> 14:10.020
Because they don’t realize just now. They will doing when they realize. It’s a very open offer to all of you

14:10.020 --> 14:15.040
not to feel insulted or bad, but to do it with your heart. If you cannot do it, you should not do it,

14:15.040 --> 14:19.020
because this is a very great tusk we have taken over, it’s a tremendous tusk.

14:19.020 --> 14:25.180
Is not just having some people around you and having […], it’s a very deep tusk

14:25.180 --> 14:31.640
and those who are capable of doing it, should only do it otherwise they spoil the game.

14:31.860 --> 14:35.040
First of all, we always worship Shri Ganesha,

14:35.400 --> 14:39.340
who came as our Lord Jesus Christ on this earth.

14:39.400 --> 14:45.200
Because He is the Vignanashaka, He is the one who takes out all the perils

14:45.280 --> 14:50.420
that can come to this deep work.

14:56.520 --> 15:06.940
Nobody has authority to do Havana unless and until they are the Brahmins, means the ones who [..] you can’t do it.

15:07.080 --> 15:10.260
One develop lots of problems.

15:58.720 --> 16:02.180
All right! So now this is the beginning.

16:02.180 --> 16:08.000
Do it very carefully. You have to put it round because you are realized souls, you have your own powers.

16:08.000 --> 16:16.760
When you put it round, what you do, you give a Bandhan yourself, and whatever is there within you, goes into it and you put it.

16:16.760 --> 16:24.980
So the fire discriminately does everything. It solves all the problems at one time.

16:25.800 --> 16:31.400
It burns off whatever is bad, it gives you whatever is good.

16:31.400 --> 16:37.980
It will establish the gold in you, it will give you the lustre, everything works out simultaneously.

16:37.980 --> 16:42.760
But you have to awaken the subtleness, for that you have to be sublte yourself.

16:42.900 --> 16:48.100
If you are gross and if you are mundane, and if you are on that level,

16:48.100 --> 16:53.760
then rather difficult. You can understand that. You have to have the level.

16:55.020 --> 16:57.580
Alright. Let's do it.

17:14.340 --> 17:22.720
Now, you have to say ‘Agni Devta’, because ‘Agni Devta’ is the one, which is ‘Swaha’ and you have to say about other Devata.

18:53.440 --> 19:00.780
See, Agni as I told you is the seeking, all right? Is the water.

19:00.780 --> 19:05.060
Now, today you are going to do Devi’s names, means that is the desire.

19:05.060 --> 19:08.400
The most powerful thing is Devi’s names.

19:08.400 --> 19:14.840
What you are doing, is to now trying to purify your desires – the basics, absolutely,

19:14.840 --> 19:20.360
where you have to return after all. So, that’s what you have trying to do.

19:20.360 --> 19:25.500
But supposing you want to have more [ascent], then you should do Brahmadeva Saraswati.

19:25.500 --> 19:31.380
Now if you want to have more evolution – Vishnu.

19:32.660 --> 19:41.840
We are quite evolved, but I find a gap between the others, so let us create more desires, all right?

19:41.840 --> 19:48.380
Because if we only evolve, only we few will left in the air, the rest will be all not belonging.

19:48.380 --> 19:51.660
Take the Vedas, look where they are (people laughing).

19:51.660 --> 19:56.620
We have to work it out, they are all blind people.

19:56.620 --> 19:59.120
They don’t understand. We have to go slow

19:59.200 --> 20:06.640
and to make it slow and to make them come up, this is the Puja we are doing to desire.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.180
Mahakali Puja to desire,

20:09.180 --> 20:12.940
is the Devis Puja, the primordial Mother, Adi Shaktis Pujas is there,

20:12.940 --> 20:17.060
that, so the Desire is created.

21:14.180 --> 21:18.020
See, it doesn’t burn. It’s a living thing. It doesn’t burn it.

21:36.060 --> 21:51.420
What you have in your hand, all the fragrant things from various sources, are meant to be put there fragrance of the Mother Earth,

21:51.420 --> 22:05.180
and put fragrance for this fire. So, it burns away all that is nonsensical and keeps the fragrance and makes the whole atmosphere fragrant.

22:05.180 --> 22:09.060
Fragrance is the essence of Mother Earth.

22:09.060 --> 22:16.860
The ‘Bhoo’ – that is called as the ‘Bhoo’ – but is the fragrance, causal.

22:22.940 --> 22:26.320
First of all when it is better, ....

22:26.320 --> 22:30.700
So, first we are going to say a few names of Shiva.

22:43.700 --> 22:48.940
For Shiva you need not do it. [...] But Now just now we will do it. The names you can do.

22:48.940 --> 22:54.500
This is the gold we have to do. You have to burn ourselves, because Shiva is Sadashiva.

22:54.500 --> 22:57.300
What is there to burn anything?

23:17.160 --> 23:20.540
This is the spirit.[....]

23:23.240 --> 23:32.380
A yogi recites the names in a row (without ‘swaha’).

24:09.960 --> 24:20.520
Virata-Atma, see! The Virata. It resides in the heart. See the relationship.

28:44.220 --> 28:49.600
Chit Agni. This is Chit Agni. Agni ok? Attention.

54:20.780 --> 54:27.220
I thought of the...this is digestion - is the Swaha, is to digest.

54:27.220 --> 54:31.980
That’s what you get with the word digest, is better Swaha – that digest,

54:31.980 --> 54:37.660
whatever is good for the body, it turns out to do the best.

54:37.660 --> 54:41.440
All right? Whatever is not needed, it burns.

54:41.440 --> 54:45.960
You can say Swaha is actually digestion, digestive power.

54:45.960 --> 54:49.760
Swaha is a digestive power of fire, is Swaha.

54:49.760 --> 54:51.500
Void. It is all void.

54:54.620 --> 54:59.440
Intestines, liver, everything...Liver also sorts all your poisons.

55:03.620 --> 55:07.900
Kidneys also [ ] out whichever is wrong.

55:07.900 --> 55:09.500
So, that’s what it is.

55:09.500 --> 55:12.440
Retention of the good and the expulsion of the bad.

55:23.660 --> 55:28.180
All this people worship fire for the same reason.

55:32.840 --> 55:43.440
These are all Viveka – attention, to the Angi again. The Agni, the fire of your Chitta. You see, when it gets enlightened it becomes Chitta.

55:43.440 --> 55:49.020
That’s why when – I cannot explain why, how I do these things, because Mine is Chita Shakti.

55:49.020 --> 55:51.740
First you have to become ‘Chitti’ and then Chitti Shakti.

55:51.740 --> 55:54.860
So, this is a little gap in between.

56:03.360 --> 56:11.440
Means the Agni, means in the Chitta whatever you put into an enlightened persons Chitta, he knows how to sort out.

56:12.760 --> 56:14.520
Chit Agni.

56:22.500 --> 56:24.620
without the baddhas?

56:26.320 --> 56:29.000
10 names of Guru is good...

57:50.060 --> 57:58.180
That is the Guru Shakti also, because only if you have the Guru Shakti you can discriminate. You know who to burn out.

58:11.740 --> 58:15.280
Now, for example Rajneesh was burned by fire.

58:15.280 --> 58:17.740
Fire means that settle.

58:21.420 --> 58:25.500
Ahankara can be burned by fire. So many things can be.

58:38.240 --> 58:45.880
And you appear like - even these flames you see – actually your Chakras appear like this, only like flames, but they’re very silent,

58:45.880 --> 58:50.080
they are beautifully burning of different colors.

58:56.220 --> 59:01.780
Now, you have to take out all the Badhas, you see. That better do it now.

59:02.660 --> 59:05.600
Start it with Bristol.

59:05.600 --> 59:53.300
All the Badhas of Bristol, of London, of the English Centres, of our Ashrams, of lethargy, of false gurus, of insincerity, argumentativeness, selfishness, uncollectivity, miserliness...

59:55.220 --> 59:57.140
All the badhas of families.

59:57.460 --> 01:00:00.800
Very true. Very true.

01:00:01.900 --> 01:00:05.440
All the badhas of attachments.

01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.920
All the badhas of children.

01:00:14.260 --> 01:00:19.220
All the badhas that prevent us from surrendering.

01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:23.000
All the badhas that give us heat.

01:00:24.820 --> 01:00:27.020
Ignorance.

01:00:28.420 --> 01:00:30.100
Delusion.

01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:33.120
Illusion.

01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.860
All the badhas of psychologists.

01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:46.480
All the badhas of drinking.

01:00:49.180 --> 01:00:51.860
All the badhas of analysing.

01:00:54.600 --> 01:00:56.500
Anger.

01:00:58.040 --> 01:00:59.780
Sympathizing.

01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:04.840
And also borrowing and lending

01:01:07.140 --> 01:01:10.040
– in Sahaja Yoga it is not allowed.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.340
Ego. Oh – baba!

01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:18.020
Do it trice.

01:01:25.900 --> 01:01:27.940
Physical ailments.

01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:30.980
Mental ailments.

01:01:34.420 --> 01:01:37.460
Drinking.

01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:43.680
Y: Eating too much.

01:01:44.840 --> 01:01:48.060
M: Eating too much is very important.

01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:53.960
M: Bhuts and Badhas. Eating too much is not bhut.

01:01:59.800 --> 01:02:02.760
Y: All the badhas of all the doctors.
