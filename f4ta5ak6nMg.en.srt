1
00:00:07,978 --> 00:00:17,392
So this, this centre that is what we call the
Swadishthana centre is the centre that gives you

2
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:27,660
your future energy to think of your future,
your planning; which gives you energy to

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:35,212
bring forth the manifestation of the physical
labor, of physical exercise or physical work.

4
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:42,730
This poor centre has to work for one work:
to convert the fat for the use of the brain.

5
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:50,700
Now, if one centre which has to do many
other things starts doing only one work,

6
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:52,766
all other things are neglected.

7
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,526
As a result of that you develop problems, because
it has to cater to your liver, to your pancreas,

8
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:14,000
to your kidneys, to your spleen, and once
it goes into action for one channelized

9
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:21,180
work it gets programmed for it, and then
it cannot take care of these things.

10
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:32,118
That’s how you develop a bad liver, you develop
a diabetes, kidney trouble, blood pressures.

11
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,863
Also you develop a very serious
disease called blood cancer.

12
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,075
Now, Sahaja Yoga can cure all these troubles.

13
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,560
It’s only physical, but it can cure even physical
troubles, because if this centre is brought to its

14
00:01:52,560 --> 00:02:01,800
normal behaviour, if it is made to behave
in a very normal way, you can easily cure

15
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:10,620
all such diseases which come out of your over
activity, over-thinking, over-imaginativeness.

16
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:14,337
It’s a very dangerous thing to
always think about the future.

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,340
For example, now we are here sitting down,
we should be comfortably sitting down and

18
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,200
talking to each other.

19
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,600
Instead of that we are now, we are thinking
‘What am I going to do tomorrow?’ or ‘What

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:31,680
am I going to do when I go home?’, ‘How I’m
going to cook?’, ‘What am I going to eat?’,

21
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:35,604
or ‘How I am going to take my train?’,

22
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:44,040
all these futuristic behaviours lead
you to a very funny personality.

23
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:47,100
You become so futuristic that you forget the past.

24
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:51,835
I met a gentleman who forgot even his own name.

25
00:02:52,049 --> 00:02:57,780
He forgot the name of his father, he
forgot the name of his mother and also,

26
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,947
to the dismay of his wife, her name.

27
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:03,420
And she started crying.

28
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,560
She said, “Now what to do?

29
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,240
He’s forgotten everything."

30
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,820
Now he is in a futuristic area.

31
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:11,275
He just knows the future.

32
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:18,960
Then he was to be pushed back again into the
centre; then gradually he started remembering.

33
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:26,543
Then he told Me that he’s chairman of one of
the councils of a big district place in India,

34
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,800
and he said, he was – he said, “No, I am."

35
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:29,760
I said, “That’s good.

36
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:30,480
That’s better.

37
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,320
Now you are in that state where you say “I am."

38
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:37,320
So this is what happens, and
this is what’s going to happen

39
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:41,420
to our societies here, which is very futuristic.

40
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,880
So to cut it down one can try anything,
you may try anything; for example you may

41
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:52,486
show pictures of the past and things like that,
but that is not going to bring back the horse.

42
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:54,612
it’s running very fast.

43
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,812
The only thing that can work it out
is the awakening of the Kundalini.

44
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:08,160
When the Kundalini awakens itself, She
makes the centre enlightened and the

45
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:17,060
centre itself resumes its normal shape, its
normal behaviour and its normal condition.

46
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:20,929
Apart from that it has got a dynamic

47
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:31,986
power or manifestation that this one, this
centre which looks after our attention

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,640
becomes enlightened, and our attention
becomes enlightened, and the attention

49
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:45,900
which is enlightened becomes dynamic in the sense
now, sitting down here you can pay attention to

50
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:50,520
anyone – just pay attention, you don’t have to
do anything, just pay attention to that person,

51
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,278
and you can find out on your fingertips
what’s the matter with the person.

52
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:00,660
Thousands of miles he may be. When Nixon
was having trouble, suddenly I don’t know,

53
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:05,420
I said, "Find out about Nixon, how is he?"
And they said, "Ma, he is in a terrible mess."

54
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:08,340
Christ has said, ‘Your hands will speak’.

55
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,660
That’s the time has come.

56
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:13,575
These hands which looks so simple;

57
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:21,863
but they are so intricate, and so intricately
built that the nerve endings are so microscopic

58
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:29,100
that we cannot understand how much
they can tell us, how far they can go.

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,300
When the awakening takes place you
start feeling the vibrations around you,

60
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:42,049
the all-pervading Power which you have
never felt before, through these fingertips.

61
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:47,580
These fingertips which we neglect,
we misuse them, we use them for wrong

62
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:53,580
things, these fingertips themselves get
enlightened, and you start feeling them.

63
00:05:53,580 --> 00:06:00,300
That’s what I said, that you have to
get your awareness which is enlightened.

64
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,297
It’s the awareness which has to manifest.

65
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:07,080
And that’s how you start
feeling them on your fingers:

66
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:11,460
It’s wrong here, there’s wrong there,
you can see where is the problem.

67
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:15,780
Now all these are related to your centres.

68
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:19,740
These are five, six and seven; seven
on the left and seven on the right.

69
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,960
So, this is about your emotional side.

70
00:06:21,960 --> 00:06:29,898
And this is about your right, about your physical
and your rational, or you could say mental side.
