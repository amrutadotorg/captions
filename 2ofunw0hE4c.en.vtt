00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:12.317
I mean fifty percent of people are
understanding what Gavin has said.

00:00:12.334 --> 00:00:15.671
They don't have problem about it.

00:00:15.667 --> 00:00:24.134
But those who have come
for the first time, today

00:00:24.139 --> 00:00:29.514
shouldn't think they have been
here for the first time.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.574
Perhaps we do not
know how many lives

00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:38.667
we have been seeking.

00:00:38.692 --> 00:00:43.515
If we were not seeking before,

00:00:43.532 --> 00:00:46.618
we would not have been

00:00:46.632 --> 00:00:50.378
seeking in this life,

00:00:50.412 --> 00:00:52.912
so desperately.

00:00:55.472 --> 00:00:59.224
And many a times in India,

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.098
I told people,

00:01:02.093 --> 00:01:04.593
that so many saints,
who were in India

00:01:04.593 --> 00:01:11.373
once upon a time seeking in
the valleys and in the mountains,

00:01:11.393 --> 00:01:13.343
even in the Himalayas

00:01:13.343 --> 00:01:22.266
are now born in the West
and they are seeking.

00:01:22.291 --> 00:01:25.900
It's a fact

00:01:25.911 --> 00:01:29.261
but only problem is

00:01:29.279 --> 00:01:33.409
that when we are seeking in the dark,

00:01:33.419 --> 00:01:36.929
when there is no one to guide us,

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:42.791
on the contrary there are
many more to misguide us,

00:01:42.809 --> 00:01:54.060
those who have an interest in
our faults, in our disturbance,

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:57.887
or we can say in our destruction.

00:01:57.897 --> 00:02:07.359
All such people now
come to misguide

00:02:07.376 --> 00:02:10.828
and to take advantage of us.

00:02:10.836 --> 00:02:18.116
At such a point and
under such circumstances

00:02:18.128 --> 00:02:22.836
the saints, the real seekers,

00:02:22.848 --> 00:02:25.348
the people who are genuine

00:02:25.348 --> 00:02:29.381
are attacked first.

00:02:29.398 --> 00:02:32.226
Because the satanic

00:02:32.258 --> 00:02:34.758
is all the time,

00:02:34.758 --> 00:02:37.258
on one side it is destroyed

00:02:37.258 --> 00:02:40.359
and on the other side it is trying

00:02:40.388 --> 00:02:43.381
to find out who are the seekers.

00:02:43.388 --> 00:02:47.844
It is not today

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:52.168
but since the time of Rama, you
can say,  even earlier

00:02:52.198 --> 00:02:59.445
even much earlier, you can say, 8000 years
was Rama's time, even much earlier

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:02.835
everywhere a seeker was tortured.

00:03:05.405 --> 00:03:09.592
But now, in these modern times,

00:03:09.605 --> 00:03:12.553
they have become very subtle.

00:03:12.575 --> 00:03:19.980
They've learnt methods
of subtle invasion.

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:23.893
And before we realise where we are

00:03:23.893 --> 00:03:25.354
they attack.

00:03:25.354 --> 00:03:27.854
They find us.

00:03:28.933 --> 00:03:35.882
At the time of Rama, the saints, as
there are angels guiding the saints.

00:03:35.898 --> 00:03:38.822
the Satanic forces
also gathered together

00:03:38.858 --> 00:03:44.922
and tried to exploit the situation.

00:03:49.912 --> 00:03:56.837
Thus, in these modern times
what we call as Kali Yuga,

00:03:56.864 --> 00:04:00.097
we are faced today

00:04:02.854 --> 00:04:07.269
with an atmosphere of
complete confusion,

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.129
even a true seeker doesn't know

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:11.629
who is a real person;

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:15.619
to whom to go, whom to
approach, or where to get it.

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:19.509
What should we do?  We are frantic.

00:04:19.529 --> 00:04:22.669
And in that franticness,

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.189
a tremendous amount of
damage has been done

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:28.309
to your own being, inside.

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.562
But, Gavin said about my compassion

00:04:36.882 --> 00:04:39.842
I would say

00:04:39.862 --> 00:04:43.342
it is a feeling

00:04:43.372 --> 00:04:46.962
of complete anguish

00:04:46.992 --> 00:04:51.062
when you see the real seekers,

00:04:51.112 --> 00:04:53.872
genuine people

00:04:53.882 --> 00:04:57.444
the people who are
simple hearted, innocent

00:04:57.444 --> 00:04:59.944
they are my own,

00:04:59.944 --> 00:05:02.444
dragged into problems.

00:05:04.664 --> 00:05:09.021
The whole compassion gets into anguish.

00:05:09.021 --> 00:05:13.811
The mood of the compassion,
becomes an anguish.

00:05:13.821 --> 00:05:15.991
So instead of getting
angry with you

00:05:15.991 --> 00:05:20.991
or getting in anyway
upset with you,

00:05:21.001 --> 00:05:25.957
I try to find out how I
can really soothe you;

00:05:25.957 --> 00:05:31.085
how I can really cure that
part which is destroyed

00:05:31.085 --> 00:05:33.997
in these genuine people.

00:05:37.515 --> 00:05:41.353
But you have to be genuine
to face the reality.

00:05:41.376 --> 00:05:44.890
If you are not genuine,
you cannot face it.

00:05:44.896 --> 00:05:51.676
You cannot face it neither
you can accept it,

00:05:51.688 --> 00:05:54.898
because it's too much for you.

00:05:56.198 --> 00:05:58.408
But if you are genuine,

00:05:58.425 --> 00:06:02.188
the genuineness gives
you the strength

00:06:02.206 --> 00:06:04.507
to bear the reality.

00:06:04.507 --> 00:06:07.696
But reality is not a heavy stuff.

00:06:09.087 --> 00:06:13.976
It's the lightest stuff. It
makes you very light.

00:06:13.992 --> 00:06:16.972
At the edge it's just like

00:06:16.986 --> 00:06:20.396
beautiful showers.

00:06:20.406 --> 00:06:23.752
In Sanskrit there is a word Tushaar.
I don't know what you call that

00:06:23.752 --> 00:06:26.476
in English language. It's a
beautiful word, which means

00:06:26.482 --> 00:06:28.692
that when you are, say,

00:06:28.724 --> 00:06:30.832
standing there near the sea,

00:06:30.854 --> 00:06:35.744
the waves come and throw all
that little, little droplets on you.

00:06:35.752 --> 00:06:37.884
That's called as Tushaar

00:06:37.884 --> 00:06:45.071
and that is  how it is ocean of
love just breaks near your heart

00:06:45.096 --> 00:06:49.651
and throws the small,
little drops of its love

00:06:49.671 --> 00:06:53.851
on  your being and the whole
thing is beautifully worked out.

00:06:53.860 --> 00:07:02.160
It has to be that way for people who
are so much injured and all so wounded.

00:07:04.021 --> 00:07:08.489
The whole awareness has come.

00:07:08.511 --> 00:07:10.030
Everywhere!

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:16.820
But, whatever we have been so far
thinking to the truth, is not true.

00:07:16.850 --> 00:07:19.135
There is something of the beyond,

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:22.251
even through the scientific approach,

00:07:22.252 --> 00:07:27.432
even through the
psychological probing,

00:07:27.444 --> 00:07:32.349
we have been able to see through that
there is something beyond.

00:07:32.342 --> 00:07:35.392
Now what is that beyond case?

00:07:35.422 --> 00:07:37.252
Where do we have to go?

00:07:37.264 --> 00:07:39.292
What are we seeking?

00:07:39.292 --> 00:07:42.382
Really what happens to us?

00:07:42.402 --> 00:07:44.471
It's not known to us,

00:07:44.471 --> 00:07:46.971
because it is an unknown quality.

00:07:46.971 --> 00:07:49.981
And whatever is known to us

00:07:49.991 --> 00:07:52.491
has been known to
us, mostly by people

00:07:52.511 --> 00:07:56.466
who are not themselves been there;

00:07:56.497 --> 00:08:00.980
has been committed by someone
or somebody has told them.

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:06.140
Incarnations and the great prophets

00:08:06.150 --> 00:08:09.170
who came on this Earth

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.889
to talk about the Kingdom of Heaven,

00:08:12.889 --> 00:08:14.889
you know what was their life.

00:08:14.889 --> 00:08:17.899
Nobody understood them at all.

00:08:17.929 --> 00:08:20.569
Leave alone, nobody

00:08:20.599 --> 00:08:23.099
became even a little part of them.

00:08:23.099 --> 00:08:26.896
Nobody got realisation,

00:08:26.909 --> 00:08:29.213
and this was the biggest problem

00:08:29.213 --> 00:08:31.586
and this was to be solved.

00:08:31.603 --> 00:08:36.566
Unless and until you are realised,
everything becomes a mockery.

00:08:36.566 --> 00:08:41.078
Yesterday I was very happy to visit

00:08:41.102 --> 00:08:44.724
Tunbridge Wells. It was a very nice programme.

00:08:44.724 --> 00:08:48.394
What surprised me the most
the way people accepted it

00:08:48.414 --> 00:08:55.064
and it was very interesting the way
people came forward and received it.

00:08:55.084 --> 00:08:57.024
Now I found there...

00:08:58.024 --> 00:09:00.174
some people were
doing acupuncture,

00:09:00.174 --> 00:09:03.464
some were doing healing some
were doing... In all goodness!

00:09:03.464 --> 00:09:05.744
They did not mean, they
did not understand,

00:09:05.744 --> 00:09:08.244
because they are doing it out of love,

00:09:08.244 --> 00:09:13.914
out of compassion, out
of feeling for others.

00:09:13.954 --> 00:09:16.935
just a simple feeling like that;

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:23.473
but they did not know, that
most of them were not realised.

00:09:23.513 --> 00:09:27.563
So there was a gentleman, who
was very nice person, no doubt.

00:09:27.595 --> 00:09:29.453
He was very nice person himself,

00:09:29.453 --> 00:09:32.267
but he was not a realised soul

00:09:32.273 --> 00:09:34.643
and he was doing acupuncture.

00:09:34.643 --> 00:09:38.775
Now this acupuncture
comes to us from Tao.

00:09:38.775 --> 00:09:41.995
I don't know if you have
heard about Tao. Lao Tse!

00:09:42.035 --> 00:09:44.395
Lao Tse was a great saint.

00:09:44.395 --> 00:09:49.107
He was an incarnation of
the Primordial Master,

00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.187
of the principle of
Primordial Master,

00:09:52.217 --> 00:09:55.010
which has incarnated many a
times on this Earth.

00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:59.459
Even Moses was the
same, you can say.

00:09:59.460 --> 00:10:01.769
Muhammad Saab was the same.

00:10:01.799 --> 00:10:04.859
There was one Raja Janaka
in India, he was the same.

00:10:04.889 --> 00:10:06.919
Nanaka, he was the same.

00:10:06.919 --> 00:10:10.212
So we had many incarnations
of that principle

00:10:10.212 --> 00:10:14.519
and he, Lao Tse, was
also one of them,

00:10:14.546 --> 00:10:17.816
but Lao Tse was there, high
up in the air, you can say

00:10:17.816 --> 00:10:21.336
or something very much different
from the normal people here.

00:10:21.336 --> 00:10:24.676
So for the normal people
to understand Lao Tse

00:10:24.686 --> 00:10:26.786
was an impossibility.

00:10:26.806 --> 00:10:30.216
Now, whatever Lao Tse
did, long time ago,

00:10:30.216 --> 00:10:32.256
because we are not authorised.

00:10:32.256 --> 00:10:34.046
You have to be authorised to do.

00:10:34.046 --> 00:10:37.796
For example, now there is this mic,

00:10:37.836 --> 00:10:41.336
which is working,
which is connected.

00:10:41.356 --> 00:10:44.346
Or in our Sahaja Yoga we
can say which is realised.

00:10:44.346 --> 00:10:47.320
Means it has realised its utility.

00:10:47.336 --> 00:10:49.540
It has become what it  has to be.

00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:51.440
It is not yet been complete.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:55.100
So when I speak in this
mic, you all hear.

00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:58.436
But supposing it is not

00:10:58.460 --> 00:11:00.960
then what is the
use of talking on this.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.206
It's not going to say anything,

00:11:03.206 --> 00:11:06.256
it does not do
anything, it's not activated.

00:11:06.256 --> 00:11:08.495
It is not working.

00:11:08.495 --> 00:11:10.995
That's why when you
are not realised,

00:11:10.995 --> 00:11:13.295
when there is no realisation in you,

00:11:13.295 --> 00:11:17.605
means when you have not found the
fulfilment of your instrument.

00:11:17.605 --> 00:11:23.025
Then you have not become,
fully the one that you have to be.

00:11:23.065 --> 00:11:25.565
When the self knowledge
has not come to you,

00:11:25.565 --> 00:11:32.895
then whatever you do becomes a outside
thing, you can call it a mockery sort of thing.

00:11:32.895 --> 00:11:36.095
but the person who is
doing it does not know.

00:11:36.125 --> 00:11:39.145
For example, somebody
who comes to telephone

00:11:39.145 --> 00:11:41.975
and he says that
telephone is out of order.

00:11:42.005 --> 00:11:43.995
He says ,"Alright, then
I will not telephone."

00:11:43.995 --> 00:11:48.396
But supposing he doesn't understand  what
does that mean? "Telephone out of order!"

00:11:48.396 --> 00:11:52.255
And he is a villager, for example,
he's never seen a telephone.

00:11:52.255 --> 00:11:55.816
So he will still use telephone.

00:11:55.845 --> 00:11:57.296
You must telephone.

00:11:57.296 --> 00:11:59.796
In India

00:11:59.796 --> 00:12:02.296
there was a village, so

00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:05.848
our washerman said
that "I must work."

00:12:05.868 --> 00:12:07.682
I said, "Alright for whom
do you want to work?"

00:12:07.709 --> 00:12:10.209
He said, "I will go to
Jawahar Lal Nehru."

00:12:10.209 --> 00:12:13.312
I said, "But he is not
contesting elections from here."

00:12:13.325 --> 00:12:17.662
I said, "In India, they said he's
not standing for the election."

00:12:17.667 --> 00:12:21.570
He said, "Doesn't matter I
can work for him sitting down."

00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:28.590
It is something like that.
You see the activation

00:12:28.620 --> 00:12:35.310
of your being is expressed through
yourself only when you are connected;

00:12:35.328 --> 00:12:40.501
that your Self Realisation is
one of the most important things.

00:12:40.501 --> 00:12:44.361
But, say for example, when
I am making this instrument,

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:46.331
when we are preparing it,

00:12:46.331 --> 00:12:50.180
then what should the instrument do
is to keep quiet and watch.

00:12:50.180 --> 00:12:54.720
so the way is very (unclear)
... but, before it was down

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:57.220
it starts running up and
down, here and there.

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:01.492
Did all kinds of things like
that, it gets spoilt.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:07.640
In the same way, in your seeking, if
there has been a problem out of ignorance

00:13:07.680 --> 00:13:12.940
out of the cunning of  the others, how do you
think I would be upset with you?

00:13:12.940 --> 00:13:18.069
Because I understand this is a problem
and that makes me much, more concerned,

00:13:18.069 --> 00:13:21.230
much more involved

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:25.503
and much more, absolutely
dedicated to you,

00:13:25.503 --> 00:13:28.603
that you have to get it!

00:13:28.613 --> 00:13:31.378
It's your birthright and you must have it

00:13:31.378 --> 00:13:34.323
and that is how you get it

00:13:36.193 --> 00:13:41.520
Now Self Realisation, this process
was not done before at all,

00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.613
in this way en
masse, it was not done.

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.130
Some may say, "Why not
this? Why was it difficult,

00:13:47.130 --> 00:13:50.494
only one person among
the millions used to get it?"

00:13:50.542 --> 00:13:53.144
(Break in Recording)

00:13:55.264 --> 00:13:59.224
...... minds of seekers I have
seen in the West

00:13:59.244 --> 00:14:01.084
and it is not surprising.

00:14:01.084 --> 00:14:05.888
I cannot understand why should such
a person come into your mind at all.

00:14:05.901 --> 00:14:09.158
This is a thing where I really fail

00:14:09.158 --> 00:14:13.178
and that I do not know
how to answer you.

00:14:13.188 --> 00:14:15.688
I mean supposing I
say there's a diamond here

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:19.271
Will you question
me?  You reject it.

00:14:19.271 --> 00:14:22.671
To see at least, is it a
diamond, then how will it be free?

00:14:22.671 --> 00:14:25.551
You may jump in, at least to see

00:14:25.561 --> 00:14:26.971
what it is like.

00:14:26.971 --> 00:14:29.611
But what happens to
people when they see things

00:14:29.647 --> 00:14:32.147
that it is just so simple, it acts,

00:14:32.147 --> 00:14:34.647
it takes no time,  it's just like this

00:14:34.647 --> 00:14:37.570
"How can it be?" " We have
heard about kundalini,

00:14:37.570 --> 00:14:40.360
many [unclear]. You have to go

00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:43.460
in for rigorous imprisonment
for years together

00:14:43.460 --> 00:14:45.960
and the guru has to kill you,
I don't know what they do,

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.460
take out your kundalini
and put through like a...

00:14:49.735 --> 00:14:52.740
like a training to a [unclear] sort of a thing

00:14:52.740 --> 00:14:56.740
and this happens and that happens
and people cut their throats,

00:14:56.740 --> 00:14:59.240
cut their noses,
stand on their heads

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:03.675
and go round like mad until you are
actually famished and you never get it,

00:15:03.675 --> 00:15:07.260
and after that I don't know
if they get it or not."

00:15:07.271 --> 00:15:10.420
And when you read the books of
kundalini, you get really frightened

00:15:10.420 --> 00:15:13.270
and when I say kundalini happens the
people are frightened there and then.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:16.530
And actually I told
them to change the name.

00:15:16.530 --> 00:15:19.410
Don't call kundalini because
kundalini means serpent power

00:15:19.410 --> 00:15:21.910
and the serpent power is the one
who is (unclear).

00:15:25.070 --> 00:15:29.034
All these wrong ideas about
kundalini have corrupted you,

00:15:29.034 --> 00:15:33.714
because of the people
who wanted (unclear).

00:15:33.744 --> 00:15:35.631
It would be something, like this,

00:15:35.634 --> 00:15:37.864
some people, very
ingenious people in India.

00:15:37.864 --> 00:15:40.864
We too have some geniuses,
great geniuses, you see.

00:15:40.881 --> 00:15:43.031
They used a very
ingenious method.

00:15:43.031 --> 00:15:46.281
They wanted to
smuggle some whiskey;

00:15:46.311 --> 00:15:49.101
Scotch whiskey, from the airport,

00:15:49.141 --> 00:15:52.371
because it was very difficult
in those days of prohibition

00:15:52.371 --> 00:15:53.591
and they could not do it.

00:15:53.591 --> 00:15:58.034
So they thought best thing is
to have some books of Gita.

00:15:58.067 --> 00:16:00.567
Boxes made like Gita books.

00:16:00.567 --> 00:16:03.564
So the Gita being a scripture in India

00:16:03.564 --> 00:16:07.922
and made a hollow thing inside
and put the whisky bottle nicely.

00:16:07.941 --> 00:16:10.912
And all these big, big, big,
big Gita books were coming

00:16:10.912 --> 00:16:13.412
in a big truck you see

00:16:13.412 --> 00:16:15.912
and nobody would object.

00:16:15.912 --> 00:16:16.962
"This is very nice."

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:19.476
Very nice whisky coming in
and we are having it.

00:16:19.476 --> 00:16:21.976
Doesn't matter, what is
there if we are little bit

00:16:21.976 --> 00:16:24.152
maligning Gita, doesn't matter.

00:16:24.152 --> 00:16:26.502
We will put so much
money to your temple

00:16:26.502 --> 00:16:28.155
and finished off for good.

00:16:28.155 --> 00:16:30.885
So there now, so this is what it is,

00:16:30.925 --> 00:16:35.358
that, you see when,

00:16:35.385 --> 00:16:39.498
when we want to sell something
that is destroying,

00:16:39.498 --> 00:16:43.709
something that is junk, that
tastes horrid, how do we do it?

00:16:43.740 --> 00:16:47.138
we have to make it look most beautiful

00:16:47.169 --> 00:16:51.639
or [unclear] in the holiest of holy.

00:16:51.639 --> 00:16:53.399
They walk like this, you see.

00:16:53.419 --> 00:16:54.679
Who are these people?

00:16:54.669 --> 00:16:58.339
They are the people who are
planning how to rob the bank.

00:16:58.369 --> 00:17:01.409
You should find some three
people or four people,

00:17:01.409 --> 00:17:05.459
seriously walking like this, you see, with
their umbrella and a complete English dress

00:17:05.469 --> 00:17:07.079
Instead, in the back

00:17:07.074 --> 00:17:09.524
must be somebody
who is trying to see

00:17:09.539 --> 00:17:12.535
how they plan how to loot you.

00:17:12.535 --> 00:17:15.035
They plan all this, such a beautiful manner

00:17:15.035 --> 00:17:17.535
the whole thing, the whole  plan that

00:17:17.535 --> 00:17:21.235
is very attractive. They
must make it attractive.

00:17:21.255 --> 00:17:23.936
They have to make it and there
are so many ways and methods.

00:17:23.965 --> 00:17:27.853
Actually some how or other
they have become (unclear)

00:17:27.863 --> 00:17:30.626
practice of this kind of cunning

00:17:30.626 --> 00:17:34.825
all their lives, so many lives they
have become so good at making money

00:17:34.825 --> 00:17:36.805
and they loot you.

00:17:36.805 --> 00:17:41.595
While you people who
are simple are just (unclear)

00:17:41.625 --> 00:17:46.535
They say, "Mother, how can it be,
kundalini is rising just like this?"

00:17:46.541 --> 00:17:49.921
On the contrary, if you
are wise, you think it over.

00:17:49.944 --> 00:17:53.105
How can it be difficult?

00:17:53.102 --> 00:17:57.021
Because it is a living process.

00:17:57.035 --> 00:18:00.771
It is a living happening as
part of your evolution.

00:18:00.771 --> 00:18:05.151
What did you do to become
a human being from a monkey?

00:18:08.207 --> 00:18:14.439
And now what are you going to do to
become that trans... human state?

00:18:15.509 --> 00:18:19.005
What exercise can you do about it?

00:18:19.005 --> 00:18:22.049
It has to be a simple step,

00:18:22.075 --> 00:18:25.085
like your own brain,

00:18:25.105 --> 00:18:27.145
like your own face,

00:18:27.145 --> 00:18:28.755
like your own eyes.

00:18:28.755 --> 00:18:32.935
You've got your eyes. Why don't you
marvel at the miracle of your eyes?

00:18:32.935 --> 00:18:37.454
If you see there is a
complete camera inside them.

00:18:37.475 --> 00:18:39.646
It's such a miracle! We
take it for granted,

00:18:39.646 --> 00:18:42.926
the eyes are like this. Oh, oh
what beautiful eyes are these.

00:18:42.969 --> 00:18:44.839
We take it for granted.

00:18:44.839 --> 00:18:46.679
Let us think of the miracle.

00:18:46.709 --> 00:18:49.209
These eyes from
where have they come?

00:18:50.679 --> 00:18:54.600
There's a wonderful book written in [unclear]

00:18:54.633 --> 00:18:58.853
in which it says that it
is impossible to believe,

00:18:58.863 --> 00:19:02.123
that law of chance has
worked out human beings,

00:19:02.123 --> 00:19:06.501
that through law of chance we
have evolved to be human beings

00:19:06.501 --> 00:19:09.873
is an impossibility because
by the law of chance

00:19:09.906 --> 00:19:14.001
we could be at the most there could be one
amoeba produced from there.

00:19:15.021 --> 00:19:18.373
It's such a complicated
human mechanism

00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.743
that has come on this earth.
It's impossible to work out.

00:19:24.163 --> 00:19:30.477
But all the kundalini knowledge, all
the kundalini science

00:19:30.489 --> 00:19:32.187
so far

00:19:32.193 --> 00:19:34.823
and I'm really...  I'm amazed!

00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:37.360
I mean that's your
Mother.  And a Mother

00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:42.169
that is a loving Mother, it is
the compassion of God within you,

00:19:42.179 --> 00:19:45.243
which has made you for these
days to get Realisation.

00:19:45.282 --> 00:19:47.563
But people are doing
something I must say.

00:19:47.563 --> 00:19:50.373
When I say that you do
not do anything about it.

00:19:50.373 --> 00:19:52.873
It works out. You people don't like it.

00:19:52.873 --> 00:19:56.293
They want to go through
all kinds of problems

00:19:56.293 --> 00:19:59.403
and they want to do all
kinds of wrong things.

00:19:59.406 --> 00:20:02.632
They want to be hit all
the time. Keep hitting!

00:20:02.632 --> 00:20:04.966
Why?

00:20:04.966 --> 00:20:07.466
God never does like that.

00:20:07.466 --> 00:20:09.966
It is done in the simplest way,

00:20:09.966 --> 00:20:11.693
in the easiest way,

00:20:11.693 --> 00:20:15.336
in the most comfortable way,

00:20:15.348 --> 00:20:18.606
so that you don't
even feel the pinch.

00:20:20.138 --> 00:20:22.098
But according to Kundalini Shastras,

00:20:22.098 --> 00:20:25.638
so-called, that these tantrikas
have horribly spoilt, you see.

00:20:25.638 --> 00:20:27.988
You have to burn yourself

00:20:27.988 --> 00:20:32.060
and you must see
the kundalini rising

00:20:32.078 --> 00:20:34.578
burning you and there's
a heat in the body.

00:20:34.578 --> 00:20:38.930
Actually, it is the cool breeze that you feel.

00:20:38.945 --> 00:20:42.760
It is written in the scriptures,
you get a wind, from the Holy Spirit.

00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:46.676
You should get it, the
wind of the Holy Spirit.

00:20:46.701 --> 00:20:50.316
And Kundalini, if She is a
part of that Holy Spirit,

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:53.916
how can it be refuted?

00:20:53.936 --> 00:20:59.467
When you try to do something,
for which you are not authorised,

00:20:59.477 --> 00:21:00.807
then She punishes you.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:03.847
It is not She who punishes,
but there is a deity

00:21:03.847 --> 00:21:05.027
who is sitting down there.

00:21:05.027 --> 00:21:08.047
At the first centre down below
you see, in the red centre,

00:21:08.047 --> 00:21:15.340
She is there. In the pink centre, She is there
and the red centre that is where there is a deity

00:21:15.363 --> 00:21:23.070
and it is the same deity, who incarnated
on this Earth as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:21:23.081 --> 00:21:29.121
This deity is the embodiment
of innocence [unclear]

00:21:29.121 --> 00:21:31.131
It can

00:21:31.131 --> 00:21:34.292
to persuade you, to [unclear] you,

00:21:34.315 --> 00:21:36.345
to tell you that "Oh God is great!"

00:21:36.345 --> 00:21:39.315
These people are false they are
trying all kinds of nonsense,

00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:42.605
because a saint can't exciten sex.

00:21:42.590 --> 00:21:45.090
(unclear)

00:21:45.122 --> 00:21:50.032
I mean this is something that
is beyond me to understand

00:21:50.049 --> 00:21:58.604
how by doing sex have you become
human beings from the monkeys.

00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:02.854
Can you connect it in anyway?

00:22:02.864 --> 00:22:07.654
Thank God, we can see our brain is here,
our heart is here and sex is down there.

00:22:08.464 --> 00:22:13.087
What is the connection in our awareness

00:22:13.097 --> 00:22:16.797
if these have anything
to do with sex?

00:22:16.827 --> 00:22:20.371
Do you find a man who is very sexy,

00:22:20.392 --> 00:22:23.478
in anyway, much more
aware than others are?

00:22:25.452 --> 00:22:28.308
I mean this is it;

00:22:28.332 --> 00:22:31.602
that those who are supposed to
be the people who are awakening

00:22:31.602 --> 00:22:34.102
and writing all kinds
of horrible things,

00:22:34.102 --> 00:22:39.162
do you find that spiritually
they are very divine people?

00:22:40.977 --> 00:22:42.542
No, I mean I would like to know.

00:22:42.559 --> 00:22:48.299
When they confuse kundalini with sex,

00:22:48.319 --> 00:22:50.836
Is it in any way

00:22:50.837 --> 00:22:52.576
sublimated?

00:22:52.607 --> 00:22:54.527
When I ask about Christ,

00:22:54.528 --> 00:22:59.068
because at least you know Christ, I
know, you say there may not be [unclear]

00:22:59.088 --> 00:23:00.449
but Christ,

00:23:00.449 --> 00:23:03.509
who was a celibate person!

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:08.169
Sex has its own path,
marriage has its own path

00:23:08.192 --> 00:23:12.340
everything is granted, is there and more,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:16.390
but it has nothing to do
with your spiritual life.

00:23:16.414 --> 00:23:18.580
That's the fact.

00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:23.660
If you have sanctified
sex, it supports.

00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:29.190
But how do you confuse these two things
is really beyond my small brain.

00:23:29.190 --> 00:23:35.111
I cannot understand, but from the way the
people are you must judge their spirituality.

00:23:35.831 --> 00:23:42.250
I mean you have known that people who
have been drinking aren't they stupid?

00:23:42.277 --> 00:23:45.010
In a way, that's true.

00:23:45.010 --> 00:23:48.150
They are not divine by any chance.

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:56.669
Then how do you connect, such
advanced spiritual people,

00:23:56.667 --> 00:23:58.140
with God?

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.310
In which way do you
find them divine?

00:24:00.310 --> 00:24:01.770
It's a simple common sense.

00:24:01.794 --> 00:24:05.150
Apart from anything, what ever is
the fact you'll find out yourself.

00:24:05.150 --> 00:24:07.370
So the Kundalini is much higher

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:12.130
in the pink triangle, where this
Ganesha is sitting down below

00:24:12.150 --> 00:24:15.400
to protect the chastity
of his Mother.

00:24:17.610 --> 00:24:23.071
So the sex and Kundalini
has nothing to do

00:24:23.091 --> 00:24:26.526
even saying this is being wrong.

00:24:26.526 --> 00:24:29.726
I mean, it would be something
like doing sex with your mind

00:24:29.766 --> 00:24:31.956
as Freud believed into it.

00:24:31.974 --> 00:24:34.286
He might be doing it, is it not? He was...

00:24:34.336 --> 00:24:37.146
He had horns, I think, in his head
I don't understand it at all

00:24:37.156 --> 00:24:40.896
but you people have suddenly
accepted just like that?

00:24:40.896 --> 00:24:43.846
For what? Have you heard any one person,

00:24:43.862 --> 00:24:47.246
any single mad man has
cured himself or not,

00:24:47.275 --> 00:24:49.775
apart from his idle stance.

00:24:49.775 --> 00:24:52.016
He had a very unhappy life

00:24:52.016 --> 00:24:55.955
and if you read his own
personal life, it's a scam.

00:24:55.959 --> 00:24:58.459
I mean, when you see their own lives

00:24:58.459 --> 00:25:02.959
they have been through I mean are we
going to be like Mr Freud ourselves

00:25:02.957 --> 00:25:04.999
This is verified and qualified.

00:25:04.999 --> 00:25:06.519
You must see his own life.

00:25:06.528 --> 00:25:09.119
You must find out what
sort of a person he is.

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:10.369
What does he do?

00:25:10.388 --> 00:25:12.348
How has he lived in this world?

00:25:12.348 --> 00:25:13.948
How has he spent his life?

00:25:13.948 --> 00:25:15.088
What has he achieved?

00:25:15.088 --> 00:25:19.608
And then finally because somebody
says something, must we come in?

00:25:19.629 --> 00:25:24.998
After all, if somebody is saying that I have
achieved some spiritual life, alright,

00:25:24.998 --> 00:25:27.498
then let see how he behaves.

00:25:27.498 --> 00:25:30.408
That is common sense.
What does he give?

00:25:30.408 --> 00:25:33.308
You should see his own life or
we should see his own feats;

00:25:33.308 --> 00:25:35.808
how he acts.

00:25:36.898 --> 00:25:40.229
If you put this test on
all these gurus put together,

00:25:40.229 --> 00:25:42.473
all these fake and
false and horrid people

00:25:42.489 --> 00:25:48.889
put together (unclear)
one worse than the other

00:25:48.910 --> 00:25:50.173
They must have keeps,

00:25:50.173 --> 00:25:52.833
I mean in no scripture, it is described

00:25:52.833 --> 00:25:55.333
that a divine man should have keeps.

00:25:58.893 --> 00:26:04.137
There are all kinds of funny
relationships with their disciples.

00:26:04.137 --> 00:26:10.249
Like an eighty year old guru will be
carrying on with an eighteen year old.

00:26:11.829 --> 00:26:14.699
Just now today I asked
Janie a very simple question

00:26:14.719 --> 00:26:18.299
I said that on the roadside,
but not in India (unclear) but here,

00:26:18.326 --> 00:26:21.729
that the people, the young people are
hugging each other and loving each other.

00:26:21.729 --> 00:26:24.009
And what are they doing under
these circumstances?

00:26:24.009 --> 00:26:28.419
Supposing a sixty year old man is
carrying on with a sixteen year old girl.

00:26:28.439 --> 00:26:30.619
Do they do it on the roads? She
said, "No, that they don't do".

00:26:30.619 --> 00:26:34.059
Why? Because you know with
your commonsense that

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:39.039
everybody is going to laugh at your
silliness and your stupidity of it.

00:26:39.076 --> 00:26:44.690
But these old Johnnies who are
pampering, I don't understand (unclear)

00:26:45.820 --> 00:26:49.620
and the ones who have
written about kundalini also.

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:51.740
Have they told you
anything about themselves

00:26:51.740 --> 00:26:55.886
or have they given anything
good to anyone whatsoever?

00:26:57.836 --> 00:27:00.860
I mean these are the common
sense questions if you ask

00:27:00.896 --> 00:27:04.036
then you will know
how true they are.

00:27:04.066 --> 00:27:08.116
The reality cannot convince you,

00:27:08.126 --> 00:27:10.416
because mentally it
cannot convince you,

00:27:10.416 --> 00:27:15.081
but it can only make you understand
that this is not reality.

00:27:15.081 --> 00:27:18.966
This is not reality.
It is something else.

00:27:18.985 --> 00:27:22.577
But when you face the
reality, you start seeing it

00:27:22.577 --> 00:27:26.122
and it is so tremendously different.

00:27:26.147 --> 00:27:30.395
But if I tell you that sitting down
here, I am feeling all your kundalinis.

00:27:30.395 --> 00:27:32.895
It's a fact. They are not
telling you the truth.

00:27:32.895 --> 00:27:35.927
Not only me, but all those who are
realised can feel your kundalini

00:27:35.927 --> 00:27:37.117
and say there is the Kundalini.

00:27:37.117 --> 00:27:40.965
And you'll also feel
when you get your realisation.

00:27:42.853 --> 00:27:46.217
But this force, this dynamic
force is not active only in this room.

00:27:46.252 --> 00:27:48.752
It is active all over, it has sprouted

00:27:49.352 --> 00:27:52.872
as yesterday the gentleman
said, like [unclear]

00:27:52.882 --> 00:27:54.367
It is there.

00:27:54.407 --> 00:27:57.525
It flows, and acts, and works
and how it looks after you,

00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:59.335
that you have to see for yourself,

00:27:59.354 --> 00:28:01.854
because you are not
in that yet.

00:28:01.854 --> 00:28:04.227
You have not yet

00:28:04.227 --> 00:28:06.594
touched the shores of reality.

00:28:06.594 --> 00:28:10.627
That's why you think that these
governments and these economic,

00:28:10.627 --> 00:28:13.287
and these what you call
political institutions, and

00:28:13.287 --> 00:28:16.931
and even spiritual
institutions have sucked into it.

00:28:16.917 --> 00:28:19.981
They are doing nothing,
it's all mockery going on

00:28:20.019 --> 00:28:23.621
the only One who is the Lord
and the King is God.

00:28:23.665 --> 00:28:27.505
And the One who really
reigns over the whole world

00:28:27.505 --> 00:28:29.675
and the universe is He.

00:28:29.675 --> 00:28:32.875
The One who has all the
powers, the telecommunications

00:28:32.875 --> 00:28:36.290
and all kinds of
communications. It is He.

00:28:36.318 --> 00:28:39.410
All are just, you see, like puppets.

00:28:39.408 --> 00:28:43.804
He's the One who is using His strings.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:46.839
As the prologue, you must
have seen the prologue

00:28:46.839 --> 00:28:49.339
In the ancient times, even
in England they used to have

00:28:49.339 --> 00:28:51.839
a person like a puppet, you see.

00:28:51.839 --> 00:28:55.613
He used to give the prologue
and he used to continue

00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.373
and tell all about how the
movements are going to be.

00:28:59.387 --> 00:29:02.607
In the same way if the prologue
is done by somebody else,

00:29:02.627 --> 00:29:08.384
while the puppets are gripped and you
think it is the puppets who are the thing.

00:29:08.417 --> 00:29:11.074
But "God,"he said "Yes,
yes we believe in God."

00:29:11.074 --> 00:29:14.134
"We have a picture of Christ.
"Oh we do believe in God."

00:29:14.184 --> 00:29:19.528
No doubt, and also you see "We
believe in God." "Yes, yes, we do believe."

00:29:19.523 --> 00:29:25.789
What! Why! Have you found
it ? Have you got it?

00:29:25.795 --> 00:29:27.709
(Inaudible)

00:29:27.709 --> 00:29:33.154
You are now at the point
that you should get it.

00:29:33.166 --> 00:29:35.920
You will get it, so many
of you have got it,

00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:39.116
but you have to little
bit settle down with it.

00:29:39.116 --> 00:29:42.885
Because I have told you that
there has been lots

00:29:42.905 --> 00:29:46.005
lots of damage has been done to you

00:29:46.025 --> 00:29:54.915
by people who have ideas,
saying, "This is the reality."

00:29:54.931 --> 00:29:57.391
They didn't introduce
you to the reality.

00:29:57.418 --> 00:30:01.278
Nothing's happened within you, but they
gave you ideas, "This is reality."

00:30:01.305 --> 00:30:03.578
Then somebody gives
you ideas; like...

00:30:03.595 --> 00:30:05.715
when I was coming to England
supposing somebody says

00:30:05.715 --> 00:30:07.865
"Oh England is great!" and

00:30:07.865 --> 00:30:10.765
"in England this happens and in
England that thing happens."

00:30:10.765 --> 00:30:16.045
But I come here, I find things have not happened
and I am sure that, "This is not reality."

00:30:16.061 --> 00:30:18.611
Or if somebody says, "England...."

00:30:18.627 --> 00:30:21.951
Some body describes England
like, say, South Africa

00:30:21.965 --> 00:30:25.457
When I come here I find,
"Oh, so this is not real."

00:30:25.512 --> 00:30:30.367
Because these ideas have come
to you from all these horrible,

00:30:30.373 --> 00:30:35.582
superficial, cunning,
useless, materialistic people.

00:30:35.599 --> 00:30:38.099
You have accepted their reality,

00:30:38.099 --> 00:30:44.216
but reality is very different
and very beautiful to be faced.

00:30:44.232 --> 00:30:49.402
Each one of you should face
it and have it and enjoy it.

00:30:49.402 --> 00:30:52.913
It is for all of you to get it.

00:30:52.947 --> 00:30:57.453
Nobody can certify for
you. You have to certify yourself.

00:30:57.483 --> 00:31:03.743
Now here! You have some chakras as
I told you about [unclear]

00:31:03.759 --> 00:31:06.823
Innocence is the first one.

00:31:06.853 --> 00:31:11.410
Second chakra, which you see
is on top, is the yellow one.

00:31:11.410 --> 00:31:14.433
In between the pink,

00:31:14.430 --> 00:31:16.930
triangular bone

00:31:16.930 --> 00:31:20.813
in the spinal cord, at
the end of the spinal cord

00:31:20.836 --> 00:31:25.120
is coiled the kundalini.
Here sits the kundalini.

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.140
Now why is it called
as the serpent power?

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:31.270
I mean, it is something horrid,

00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:37.601
because any power, even
electricity moves upwards.

00:31:37.625 --> 00:31:43.636
And they thought that these
three coils moves like this.

00:31:43.651 --> 00:31:46.474
it's better to call it as
the serpent's power.

00:31:46.481 --> 00:31:49.911
But it is not the power of a serpent.

00:31:49.944 --> 00:31:52.924
You see when the adjective
is used before the noun

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:58.067
then it is not true that the
adjective becomes the noun.

00:31:58.089 --> 00:32:03.452
So once you say it is the power of a
serpent, everything goes wrong.

00:32:03.472 --> 00:32:08.792
Now so that if this is like the power of a
serpent, then he bites you. You might get..

00:32:08.811 --> 00:32:11.311
you see all kinds of
creatures then you can get

00:32:11.311 --> 00:32:15.171
all kinds of dancing poses and you
can even take out your clothes, you see,

00:32:15.191 --> 00:32:17.251
and everything can happen.

00:32:17.251 --> 00:32:20.091
Every sort of thing can happen
to you as soon as you

00:32:20.113 --> 00:32:23.423
change an adjective for the noun
and the noun for the adjective.

00:32:23.463 --> 00:32:25.963
Only in religion, they do like this

00:32:25.963 --> 00:32:27.713
[unclear]

00:32:27.713 --> 00:32:29.513
but not anywhere else.

00:32:29.512 --> 00:32:31.843
You will not find this mistake
committed anywhere else

00:32:31.843 --> 00:32:34.343
They are very particular.
But in this one when they say

00:32:34.343 --> 00:32:37.283
serpent power that means
it is like a serpent,

00:32:37.328 --> 00:32:41.078
but at it's minimum it has
something to do with the serpent.

00:32:41.118 --> 00:32:43.548
It is [unclear]. It is horrid.

00:32:43.548 --> 00:32:49.081
It is extremely heating up. It is
not [unclear]. It may finish you.

00:32:49.088 --> 00:32:54.402
You'll be surprised that
Kundalini can never harm you.

00:32:57.460 --> 00:33:01.502
You know we think that electricity can
be used for good purpose or bad purpose,

00:33:01.508 --> 00:33:06.688
atomic energy can be used for good
purpose or bad, but not Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:06.719 --> 00:33:09.758
Try!  You cannot.

00:33:09.758 --> 00:33:13.508
If you want to kill someone
through Sahaja Yoga you cannot.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:17.938
You can cure people, but if you
want somebody to be sick, you cannot.

00:33:17.938 --> 00:33:20.438
You can try.

00:33:20.438 --> 00:33:22.938
All of the Sahaja Yogis can try

00:33:22.938 --> 00:33:28.436
but you could not, but be
careful because this is divine,

00:33:28.486 --> 00:33:29.916
pure.

00:33:29.916 --> 00:33:34.368
It will be something like saying that

00:33:34.378 --> 00:33:41.928
nothing so pure in this world, but I can say if
the water, see you can say water for washing

00:33:41.958 --> 00:33:45.156
and people can say no,
the water wasn't washed

00:33:45.178 --> 00:33:50.609
but we can use the same
water, for spoiling something

00:33:50.609 --> 00:33:52.749
(unclear)

00:33:52.761 --> 00:33:56.514
we can say that you
can remove the thing.

00:33:56.531 --> 00:33:59.031
That is not the quality of

00:33:59.031 --> 00:34:01.984
divine vibrations. It is not.

00:34:02.001 --> 00:34:04.474
Why do you think you can use
for both the purposes?

00:34:04.492 --> 00:34:09.312
That's why I said there is nothing
so pure...  I'm speaking only for me,

00:34:09.334 --> 00:34:12.992
as the divine vibrations
which is never soiled

00:34:13.032 --> 00:34:19.924
and it never, never can
be used for any bad purpose.

00:34:19.943 --> 00:34:26.074
As soon as you start thinking about something
bad, vibrations will stop immediately.

00:34:26.084 --> 00:34:32.386
As soon as you think of harming someone
your vibrations will stop, finished.

00:34:32.403 --> 00:34:40.056
As soon as your mind goes on to some sort of a
destructive plan, vibrations stop. That's all.

00:34:40.056 --> 00:34:43.301
You get convinced and so many things happen

00:34:43.331 --> 00:34:46.761
that you cannot do, any if you try to
do, you lose your vibrations altogether.

00:34:46.761 --> 00:34:50.441
It's a very [unclear].

00:34:51.511 --> 00:34:54.363
So you cannot use it for any bad purpose

00:34:54.373 --> 00:34:58.503
that is absolutely sure and certain.

00:34:58.501 --> 00:35:01.506
Now see how beautiful you are made.

00:35:01.511 --> 00:35:05.111
Now I've told you the red one,
then the yellow and the green

00:35:05.111 --> 00:35:06.321
and then you have got the blue

00:35:06.321 --> 00:35:10.461
this one just like snow and here is
the white (unclear) this thing,

00:35:10.497 --> 00:35:14.151
and then on top (unclear).
These seven chakras are there

00:35:14.174 --> 00:35:16.401
and all these seven
chakras, one by one.

00:35:16.423 --> 00:35:20.143
If you see in the chart, you have got the
full idea about the seven chakras,

00:35:20.143 --> 00:35:24.043
the deities that are sitting
on them and and how they help

00:35:24.079 --> 00:35:26.963
and what is the sympathetic system
what is the parasympathetic,

00:35:26.963 --> 00:35:29.463
what is the left side, what
is the right side of the man

00:35:29.463 --> 00:35:31.963
and what is the lower side.

00:35:31.963 --> 00:35:35.906
The lower side of the man is the hell part.

00:35:35.906 --> 00:35:38.936
The left side of the man
is the subconscious.

00:35:38.966 --> 00:35:43.050
The right side of the man is the supra-conscious;
by which you plan for the future:

00:35:43.073 --> 00:35:45.100
the ambitious part.

00:35:45.106 --> 00:35:48.576
And here is the superconsciousness
above the mind.

00:35:48.616 --> 00:35:52.856
So the attention has to go up,
up, up,  and break this.

00:35:52.856 --> 00:35:54.986
That is the baptism as you call it,

00:35:54.986 --> 00:36:00.086
Break this part and become one with that
subtle being which is universally the same...
