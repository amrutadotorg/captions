WEBVTT

00:00:03.093 --> 00:00:05.673
Today is a special day, as you know

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:10.100
we are worshipping the Goddess,

00:00:11.113 --> 00:00:16.520
who came on this earth nine times before,

00:00:18.213 --> 00:00:21.933
to kill all the demons and all the negativity

00:00:22.426 --> 00:00:27.926
and relieve all the bhaktas to worship.

00:00:31.626 --> 00:00:37.260
All her work has already been described.

00:00:38.593 --> 00:00:42.780
Despite that they find,

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.220
new type of devils,

00:00:48.526 --> 00:00:51.380
new type of negative people,

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.379
have come back.

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:00.820
Perhaps it had to be.

00:01:14.318 --> 00:01:19.180
This had to be maybe, after all it is Kali Yuga

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.140
and the drama of Kali Yuga would not be

00:01:23.906 --> 00:01:27.660
performed unless and until they are there.

00:01:31.285 --> 00:01:35.220
So, to complete this drama, they came.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.300
But this time

00:01:40.446 --> 00:01:46.380
is going to be a very different type of

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.479
war.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.580
It's going to be the war of the peaceful people

00:01:58.613 --> 00:02:01.420
and the peaceful people

00:02:02.419 --> 00:02:07.380
are the most successful people

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:12.153
in every walk of life, even in a war.

00:02:14.007 --> 00:02:16.906
It did not work out before.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.100
They say that when Genghis Khan came,

00:02:23.753 --> 00:02:28.820
he went to a very big monastery of Buddhist,

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:34.380
near Gaya, and killed all of them,

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:38.380
there were about 30,000 of Buddhists there,

00:02:38.813 --> 00:02:42.100
and they didn't say a
word and they were all killed.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.420
So people started disbelieving in Buddhism.

00:02:50.206 --> 00:02:54.660
They said, ''What kind of a Buddhism
is here, why didn't Buddha save them?''.

00:02:56.473 --> 00:03:00.687
That's human style of thinking.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:06.140
''Buddha should have saved these
30,000 people who were peaceful,

00:03:07.413 --> 00:03:09.706
who were resisting,

00:03:11.766 --> 00:03:14.940
in a manner that was no resistance,

00:03:15.813 --> 00:03:20.500
and so they were all killed by this
horrible fellow called Genghis Khan''.

00:03:21.893 --> 00:03:24.980
But you will be surprised, in this Kali Yuga,

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.060
this Genghis Khan has been praised by many
authors, and there are books written about him.

00:03:32.933 --> 00:03:37.340
He was not a Muslim, but some sort of a crackpot.

00:03:38.346 --> 00:03:43.060
He finished off many mosques,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:50.540
he destroyed many beautiful buildings

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:56.780
and also he came to India and ruled
there for a short time.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.466
All that's a history.

00:04:01.666 --> 00:04:03.980
In the same way,

00:04:05.986 --> 00:04:10.500
there have been wars

00:04:15.693 --> 00:04:20.700
between Christians and Non-Christians,

00:04:22.313 --> 00:04:25.460
between Muslim and Non-Muslims.

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:32.740
All kinds of wars we have heard of where

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.740
only the faithful got lost

00:04:38.546 --> 00:04:43.100
the real people got lost, the one who worshipped

00:04:43.546 --> 00:04:48.540
God with full faith, got lost.

00:04:51.233 --> 00:04:54.580
So many people became atheists

00:04:55.286 --> 00:05:00.580
and they said, ''There is nothing
like God, nothing like his Divine power,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.546
it never existed, we were stupid,
we were foolish, to follow all this''.

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.340
And those who were in charge of religion

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:14.246
took full advantage of that and said

00:05:14.447 --> 00:05:18.980
that these people were sinful people,

00:05:19.826 --> 00:05:24.420
these people were not Godly people

00:05:25.006 --> 00:05:30.580
and that's how they were
killed by us and we were victorious.

00:05:33.166 --> 00:05:38.460
The idea of victory they had,
that they have been successful

00:05:38.953 --> 00:05:42.893
and so many people
have been butchered by us.

00:05:47.273 --> 00:05:49.940
So we come to Kali Yuga,

00:05:52.233 --> 00:05:54.646
and in Kali Yuga

00:05:55.426 --> 00:05:59.400
the same thing has started, in a subtler way,

00:05:59.633 --> 00:06:04.260
in a different way,
it has started that there's a big

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.045
war going on between the people

00:06:08.246 --> 00:06:12.920
who are anti-God

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:19.180
and who are using God for their own purpose.

00:06:19.993 --> 00:06:24.780
Very dishonest, very corrupt, very cruel people

00:06:25.353 --> 00:06:30.620
and they are using the flag of God,

00:06:31.433 --> 00:06:36.420
that banner which they have no right to use.

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.620
Then there are Sahaja Yogis,

00:06:42.926 --> 00:06:47.913
who have got their Realization
and they have to fight them.

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.780
Now the difference

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.460
in the previous wars
and this war is very different.

00:07:01.713 --> 00:07:07.460
In those wars, you see all those
who were supposed to be victorious

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:16.353
- this was, after all, the nine battles

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:20.026
of the Divine Mother

00:07:22.106 --> 00:07:27.220
- the negativity that came
up and which became successful,

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:32.900
started feeling very confident that
we have achieved what we wanted.

00:07:37.293 --> 00:07:39.620
But in Kali Yuga,

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:45.020
in the light of Kali Yuga,

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:50.580
all those historical victories

00:07:52.606 --> 00:07:56.060
are regarded as shameful things,

00:07:56.673 --> 00:08:01.620
as something very aggressive and non-sensical.

00:08:04.886 --> 00:08:08.300
This is now being described everywhere.

00:08:09.220 --> 00:08:13.460
Like the white skinned people went to,

00:08:14.986 --> 00:08:18.940
America and killed all the rest of them there.

00:08:20.713 --> 00:08:25.580
Now, that is coming into light.

00:08:27.173 --> 00:08:30.300
All these people

00:08:30.986 --> 00:08:34.860
who thought themselves to be victorious

00:08:35.173 --> 00:08:38.900
- their children, their grandchildren,
their progeny - are ashamed of them,

00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:43.620
ashamed to call that
they were their forefathers,

00:08:45.066 --> 00:08:47.413
up till the last war.

00:08:50.453 --> 00:08:53.300
This awareness, which has come,

00:08:55.406 --> 00:09:00.260
is the real victory of modern times,

00:09:01.039 --> 00:09:03.426
of this Kali Yuga.

00:09:04.113 --> 00:09:07.620
That everything that was accepted

00:09:08.226 --> 00:09:12.060
as a part of the game, as the

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:16.780
lifestyle, you can call it,

00:09:17.219 --> 00:09:22.380
is now being challenged
in modern times everywhere.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.845
Whatever is aggression,

00:09:25.046 --> 00:09:29.860
whatever is oppression,

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.113
whatever is cruel,

00:09:33.466 --> 00:09:38.660
is now punished also.

00:09:41.526 --> 00:09:46.140
You see so many war criminals might have escaped

00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:50.293
but so many went into trials,

00:09:50.494 --> 00:09:55.413
it never happened before,
nobody took Genghis Khan to a trial.

00:09:56.613 --> 00:09:58.900
Now in a very subtle way,

00:09:59.533 --> 00:10:03.860
all these aggressive people are getting now afraid

00:10:04.386 --> 00:10:08.940
that they will be questioned

00:10:10.013 --> 00:10:13.860
and they maybe tortured.

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:21.226
It started, I don't know where,
but definitely at the beginning of the Kali Yuga.

00:10:21.500 --> 00:10:27.140
If you remember, in this country
there was a great aggressive man called Mussolini,

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:31.020
and ultimately he was hanged.

00:10:32.726 --> 00:10:35.540
In Germany there was a very powerful man

00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.560
called Hitler and Himler and all this.

00:10:38.933 --> 00:10:41.220
God knows what happened to them,

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:44.706
even the Germans don't want to take his name,

00:10:45.026 --> 00:10:47.193
they are all ashamed of him.

00:10:48.326 --> 00:10:51.866
Then we had somebody, say in England,

00:10:52.093 --> 00:10:57.140
Warren Hastings, who came to India, he was put to
jail.

00:10:57.626 --> 00:10:59.860
This was never done before.

00:11:02.053 --> 00:11:04.900
If Napoleon aggressed people,

00:11:05.613 --> 00:11:08.113
he thought he was very victorious,

00:11:08.599 --> 00:11:11.740
but he could not continue with it,

00:11:12.393 --> 00:11:14.740
he had to face it.

00:11:15.851 --> 00:11:18.185
You see anybody,

00:11:18.386 --> 00:11:22.700
who has been aggressive,

00:11:22.986 --> 00:11:26.300
who has been dominating,

00:11:26.613 --> 00:11:32.380
who has been very cruel, demonic,

00:11:33.306 --> 00:11:37.620
has been taken to task, mostly in his lifetime.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:45.780
Now, if not in his lifetime,

00:11:46.466 --> 00:11:50.660
afterwards, he was maligned,

00:11:50.861 --> 00:11:54.513
and he doesn't have a
name like “a hero” or anything,

00:11:54.713 --> 00:11:57.926
people don't want to erect their statues.

00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:03.340
So the awareness has come
in the mind of the people.

00:12:03.786 --> 00:12:06.040
Like a person like Stalin,

00:12:06.240 --> 00:12:09.113
who ruled Russia once upon a time,

00:12:09.314 --> 00:12:13.592
today you can't see even one statue of Stalin,

00:12:13.793 --> 00:12:16.180
these are modern times.

00:12:17.946 --> 00:12:21.227
See the power of modern times!

00:12:21.766 --> 00:12:24.440
And that is frightening to those people

00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:28.420
who think they can get along
with whatever they are doing.

00:12:29.913 --> 00:12:35.980
It is going to be very soon understood by them,

00:12:36.393 --> 00:12:39.620
that they have to stop all this nonsense,

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.300
otherwise they will suffer.

00:12:44.066 --> 00:12:47.660
It's not those whom they are dominating

00:12:47.946 --> 00:12:51.333
but those who are dominating, who will suffer.

00:12:51.586 --> 00:12:55.007
They will suffer physically,
they will suffer mentally,

00:12:55.207 --> 00:12:58.220
they will suffer emotionally, and also

00:12:58.420 --> 00:13:02.573
their fame will be in the mud.

00:13:04.306 --> 00:13:08.340
So today's victory of the

00:13:09.313 --> 00:13:13.300
power of the Divine Mother,

00:13:13.946 --> 00:13:18.740
is doing one very great work - is to expose,

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:24.540
and this exposure will be

00:13:25.219 --> 00:13:29.820
condemning publicly those
people who are doing wrong.

00:13:32.580 --> 00:13:35.300
If you see from that point of view

00:13:35.580 --> 00:13:40.853
you will understand how we are victorious now.

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:46.586
Many of you felt very sad that I
didn't get the award [Peace Nobel Price].

00:13:46.787 --> 00:13:49.380
This award makes no difference to Me

00:13:49.733 --> 00:13:52.300
and to you also, I must tell you.

00:13:52.513 --> 00:13:56.820
Because you have come without I having any award,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:14:00.940
and many will come without
having any award as such.

00:14:01.506 --> 00:14:05.480
But, this time, for the first time,

00:14:05.693 --> 00:14:10.780
if you notice, the people
who got the award are condemned.

00:14:11.613 --> 00:14:14.660
Even now they are writing against it,

00:14:14.926 --> 00:14:17.540
even now they are criticized.

00:14:18.193 --> 00:14:23.273
So those who have been, they
thought they were very smart,

00:14:23.473 --> 00:14:27.780
but the smartness is out now and
I don't know how long will it go on.

00:14:27.980 --> 00:14:32.820
Because even today, if you open a
newspaper, you will find something about it,

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:36.427
that how stupidly they have done it,

00:14:36.627 --> 00:14:40.140
they can't understand what
was the reason they have done it.

00:14:40.340 --> 00:14:43.580
Not only the people who selected are criticized,

00:14:43.780 --> 00:14:48.286
but very much more the people who are selected.

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.740
Now, as being Sahaja Yogis,

00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:58.180
we have to know what is the difference between

00:14:58.453 --> 00:15:03.333
the consciousness at that
time and awareness at this time.

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:14.133
That time it was necessary to kill those demons -
finish them, but they are back again on the stage.

00:15:19.493 --> 00:15:23.780
Now, at this time, when it is Kali Yuga,

00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:26.900
they are exposed,

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:34.420
they are condemned, they are put in the jail

00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:38.220
and they are now punished publicly.

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:42.807
So the collective awareness

00:15:43.953 --> 00:15:47.873
has got such a great victory, I think,

00:15:48.073 --> 00:15:52.980
over these people whom so
many came, killed and died

00:15:53.180 --> 00:15:55.580
without getting any punishment out of it,

00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:58.860
without getting any defamation out of it.

00:16:01.386 --> 00:16:04.140
Now let us see
what is consciousness

00:16:04.486 --> 00:16:06.706
and what is awareness.

00:16:19.773 --> 00:16:24.540
It is a subtle subject, which I think you all
can understand.

00:16:27.219 --> 00:16:29.700
Consciousness is that,

00:16:30.380 --> 00:16:34.020
when you are made conscious,
you become conscious about it.

00:16:34.526 --> 00:16:37.500
Like I have my hand here, alright,

00:16:38.566 --> 00:16:43.460
but normally I am not conscious of it,
that I have a hand.

00:16:46.866 --> 00:16:51.180
If a man is sleeping,
he's not conscious that he is sleeping.

00:16:52.166 --> 00:16:56.860
When you tell Me,
“You have a hand”. I become conscious,

00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.580
or something pricks Me, then I become conscious.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.260
Otherwise, I am unconscious about it.

00:17:08.133 --> 00:17:12.500
I'm absolutely unconscious about my eyes,

00:17:13.079 --> 00:17:15.260
I'm seeing everything.

00:17:15.793 --> 00:17:19.780
But supposing I become blind,

00:17:20.546 --> 00:17:25.180
I can't see, then I become conscious

00:17:26.020 --> 00:17:31.780
of my eyes that I've got, my eyes
through which now I cannot see.

00:17:33.333 --> 00:17:37.940
So once you say there is this hand,

00:17:38.346 --> 00:17:40.420
the consciousness is there.

00:17:41.206 --> 00:17:44.860
This we can say, is the knowledge about the hand,

00:17:45.060 --> 00:17:47.620
that you get knowledge about the hand.

00:17:49.633 --> 00:17:54.860
But once you are not conscious of the hand,

00:17:55.060 --> 00:17:57.380
that knowledge has disappeared.

00:18:00.306 --> 00:18:04.940
So, to say there is
ignorance or there is knowledge,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:08.380
both things are just the same.

00:18:09.833 --> 00:18:14.260
You are not conscious of your hand,

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.180
so you are quite ignorant about it.

00:18:18.220 --> 00:18:23.333
Now supposing somebody says,
“Your hands are very beautiful”.

00:18:25.300 --> 00:18:27.387
Somebody remarks like that,

00:18:27.587 --> 00:18:31.660
then I become conscious of
my hand, which is beautiful.

00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:33.953
Otherwise, I never knew they were beautiful.

00:18:38.378 --> 00:18:42.900
So, normally all human beings live at that level

00:18:44.026 --> 00:18:46.500
that somebody has to tell you.

00:18:46.893 --> 00:18:51.020
Now, somebody said
“you are wearing a very nice sari”, all right.

00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:54.700
Then I look at it, “yes,
it's very nice, I never knew”.

00:18:59.299 --> 00:19:03.860
So, somebody has to tell
you, then you become conscious,

00:19:05.219 --> 00:19:07.300
otherwise you are not.

00:19:10.506 --> 00:19:14.713
So, we all human beings,
at that level, are like that.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:19.460
Now, what is awareness?

00:19:21.353 --> 00:19:23.580
That's a different thing.

00:19:24.653 --> 00:19:28.707
That means, if I see

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:31.660
somebody is attacking me,

00:19:32.026 --> 00:19:34.460
I put my hand - like this,

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.780
that means I am aware that I have a hand

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.100
I'm not conscious but I am aware
that I have a hand, I have to use it.

00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:48.500
Like here in Italy you go on
using your hands all the time, like this.

00:19:50.313 --> 00:19:54.673
That means you know, you are
aware, that you have got hands,

00:19:54.873 --> 00:20:00.633
that you have to use them for expressing
something more, sort of emphatically.

00:20:03.593 --> 00:20:06.420
So we are sort of

00:20:06.699 --> 00:20:10.660
also aware of our body,

00:20:11.113 --> 00:20:13.580
we are aware of others,

00:20:15.706 --> 00:20:18.220
we know about others,

00:20:18.666 --> 00:20:22.033
we know what sort of a person another one is

00:20:22.293 --> 00:20:25.900
up till you are Self-realized.

00:20:30.073 --> 00:20:33.020
After Self-realization, what happens?

00:20:33.360 --> 00:20:35.540
It is very interesting.

00:20:37.379 --> 00:20:43.220
After Self-realization you
go beyond both these things.

00:20:44.120 --> 00:20:46.860
Consciousness and awareness.

00:20:49.366 --> 00:20:54.460
Because you go beyond thought.

00:20:56.773 --> 00:21:01.813
You have gone beyond thought, means what? - anger,

00:21:03.773 --> 00:21:08.487
all kinds of ideas, all kinds of aggression,

00:21:08.687 --> 00:21:13.500
everything is maneuvered

00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.346
or worked through your mind.

00:21:18.833 --> 00:21:23.700
So if your mind is lost, what will you do?

00:21:26.246 --> 00:21:28.460
There's no mind anymore.

00:21:30.333 --> 00:21:32.860
You exist with reality.

00:21:34.966 --> 00:21:38.860
So there is no mind to communicate

00:21:39.999 --> 00:21:44.180
we call it thoughtlessly aware - means what?

00:21:45.146 --> 00:21:50.860
We have conquered all our enemies
by giving up one enemy, that was our mind.

00:21:52.553 --> 00:21:55.020
There's no mind to suggest,

00:21:55.906 --> 00:21:58.220
there's no mind to tell you.

00:21:59.539 --> 00:22:03.153
So once there is no mind, you are lost.

00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.700
Now, it is being said that you ask
a question to yourself, “Who am I?”

00:22:12.826 --> 00:22:18.140
As soon as you ask this question, you
become thoughtless, so you get lost,

00:22:19.400 --> 00:22:21.860
you cannot answer this question.

00:22:23.933 --> 00:22:28.460
Otherwise, you might say, “I
am a woman, I am this, I am that,

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:34.980
I am a bishop or I am a
pope, I am this, I am that”.

00:22:37.633 --> 00:22:40.465
But once you are a Realized soul,

00:22:40.666 --> 00:22:44.700
who will tell you who you are? Because
the one which tells you is the mind,

00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:48.220
which doesn't exist, no thought.

00:22:50.466 --> 00:22:54.820
Means you get just dissolved into your Self.

00:22:58.426 --> 00:23:01.426
This is what is reality.

00:23:03.399 --> 00:23:05.660
But you are aware also.

00:23:06.006 --> 00:23:08.260
Now, that's another point.

00:23:13.506 --> 00:23:17.660
If you ask yourself a question, you are not there,

00:23:19.733 --> 00:23:21.953
but you are aware.

00:23:22.393 --> 00:23:27.580
If your Nabhi is catching, immediately you
know my nabhi is catching, I have got liver.

00:23:29.059 --> 00:23:31.060
You don't have to ask questions.

00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.140
Or somebody is standing near you, “Left
Swadishthana, oh my God, it is this one”.

00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.540
If somebody is very angry and hot tempered,

00:23:43.740 --> 00:23:46.192
immediately you’ll feel
such heat from that person,

00:23:46.393 --> 00:23:49.113
‘Oh baba, I´ll run away from this man”.

00:23:50.726 --> 00:23:53.300
So, this is a new

00:23:57.426 --> 00:24:00.932
realm you have entered into – reality,

00:24:01.133 --> 00:24:03.980
which you were never aware of before.

00:24:06.226 --> 00:24:11.540
Now, supposing there's a
very bad man standing near you.

00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:17.460
He might be a thief, he
might be a murderer, anything.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.807
You will not be even conscious of it,

00:24:21.007 --> 00:24:23.940
leave alone aware, normally.

00:24:24.679 --> 00:24:27.540
But once you are a Realized soul,

00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:35.919
you become aware of the whole

00:24:36.693 --> 00:24:38.940
that is reality.

00:24:39.140 --> 00:24:43.580
What are the problems in the collective,

00:24:45.993 --> 00:24:48.420
you become aware of the collective.

00:24:49.926 --> 00:24:52.980
You become aware of the
problems of the whole world.

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:56.200
Now this awareness is very different.

00:24:57.633 --> 00:25:01.780
The first awareness, as I told you, is like this.

00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:06.420
That if somebody tells you that you are
this and this,

00:25:07.666 --> 00:25:10.380
you become aware of it.

00:25:12.946 --> 00:25:15.519
In this nobody has to tell you,

00:25:17.819 --> 00:25:20.420
it's just there.

00:25:24.846 --> 00:25:28.513
You are there, you know what it is.

00:25:31.086 --> 00:25:34.220
And this is what we have achieved,

00:25:35.813 --> 00:25:38.740
in these modern times.

00:25:39.813 --> 00:25:43.300
Which is the blessing of the modern times also,

00:25:43.846 --> 00:25:48.306
that we know now who we are.

00:25:49.786 --> 00:25:54.980
You always say, we are the pure
Spirit, yesterday also I heard it.

00:25:55.466 --> 00:25:57.340
Are you sure?

00:25:57.686 --> 00:26:00.300
What makes you believe that?

00:26:02.773 --> 00:26:05.500
That you are the pure Spirit.

00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.700
I mean you haven't seen your Spirit, have you?

00:26:11.813 --> 00:26:14.900
You haven't seen your Self, what you are.

00:26:15.699 --> 00:26:18.700
Then, how do you say that you are the pure Spirit?

00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:22.420
It's just you're saying something,

00:26:23.206 --> 00:26:25.400
because I say so.

00:26:28.026 --> 00:26:30.780
But you are the pure spirit, because

00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:36.700
whatever is the description
of the pure Spirit is given

00:26:37.086 --> 00:26:39.819
- that it is aware

00:26:42.286 --> 00:26:47.420
of the Divine Power.

00:26:49.299 --> 00:26:52.580
It is aware of the Divine Power

00:26:53.346 --> 00:26:57.820
and that is how you are the pure Spirit.

00:26:58.273 --> 00:27:01.479
Because only through pure Spirit,

00:27:01.846 --> 00:27:04.647
as your personality,

00:27:04.847 --> 00:27:08.112
you can be aware of

00:27:08.313 --> 00:27:11.900
this All-pervading power.

00:27:13.633 --> 00:27:20.060
This is written in all the shastras,
in all the scriptures, everywhere.

00:27:21.540 --> 00:27:24.300
And what do you know about yourself?

00:27:26.246 --> 00:27:28.420
That you are the Spirit.

00:27:28.999 --> 00:27:33.700
Because you know about your own chakras.

00:27:34.006 --> 00:27:37.220
You know about your own nadis.

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:43.660
Now, what has happened is that
you are separated from yourself

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:46.860
and you can see yourself.

00:27:49.013 --> 00:27:52.460
You see yourself very clearly

00:27:55.519 --> 00:28:00.420
and you start seeing yourself as the present

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:04.420
and the past and the future.

00:28:05.813 --> 00:28:08.313
In the past, what I was,

00:28:08.513 --> 00:28:12.020
you see you are shocked, 
oh, my goodness, I was like this.

00:28:12.480 --> 00:28:14.486
You see it,

00:28:14.986 --> 00:28:19.180
through this present state, in the present
state you see.

00:28:20.906 --> 00:28:23.940
Then you start forgetting it,

00:28:24.140 --> 00:28:26.987
forget the past, forget the past.

00:28:31.013 --> 00:28:33.506
Then still you have the future,

00:28:34.732 --> 00:28:40.120
then you start thinking about the future.

00:28:41.513 --> 00:28:47.180
First future they think about their own
children, their wives - Sahaja Yogis also.

00:28:48.206 --> 00:28:54.260
“What will happen to my children,
what will happen to my wife?”

00:28:56.033 --> 00:28:59.900
Then they think, “What 
will happen to Sahaja Yoga?”

00:29:01.946 --> 00:29:05.407
Then they think, “What will happen to Mataji?”

00:29:07.053 --> 00:29:10.300
Also, they think, “What
will happen to this world?”

00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:16.900
Because your awareness

00:29:17.286 --> 00:29:19.940
has expanded.

00:29:22.433 --> 00:29:26.100
You are not in the limited sphere now, anymore.

00:29:28.546 --> 00:29:31.700
You can think of your children,
you can think of your wife,

00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.540
also you can think of the whole world

00:29:36.033 --> 00:29:38.700
and all the problems of the world you think.

00:29:43.333 --> 00:29:46.180
So you have reached that state, all right

00:29:47.273 --> 00:29:49.473
– up to that state we are.

00:29:51.453 --> 00:29:53.820
Now what is the thing

00:29:56.613 --> 00:29:59.340
that covers up all this,

00:30:00.446 --> 00:30:06.180
or gives you solutions, say for your
children, for your family, your wife,

00:30:06.380 --> 00:30:09.740
everyone – what is the solution?

00:30:11.026 --> 00:30:15.220
Your Mother believes in giving
the solutions, not only the problems.

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:24.160
Because, these days, there are not
problems that existed in the Navaratri,

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:29.113
they no more exist

00:30:29.533 --> 00:30:32.620
– that you can take a

00:30:33.973 --> 00:30:38.780
sword in your hand and go 
and kill somebody – no, it doesn't,

00:30:39.847 --> 00:30:42.793
it is not possible, cut what?

00:30:44.606 --> 00:30:49.060
So, today’s problems as they are, as we see,

00:30:51.487 --> 00:30:53.660
within us,

00:30:54.340 --> 00:30:57.420
we see the problems, we are aware of it

00:30:57.746 --> 00:30:59.940
and we want to do something about it.

00:31:01.426 --> 00:31:04.780
Whether we are in the past, present or future,

00:31:04.980 --> 00:31:07.420
we see the problem.

00:31:11.679 --> 00:31:14.940
So now, what is the solution?

00:31:16.459 --> 00:31:20.660
We have no weapons, nothing,

00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.420
to fight.

00:31:26.306 --> 00:31:32.220
We don't know also, so many do not
even know how to hold a sword in the hand.

00:31:32.933 --> 00:31:35.940
And so many don't even want to hold it

00:31:37.413 --> 00:31:40.340
because they are so much in compassion,

00:31:40.639 --> 00:31:44.300
in the ocean of compassion
enjoying themselves nicely.

00:31:45.326 --> 00:31:48.820
They are enjoying their own
compassion and the compassion of others,

00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:51.340
compassion of their Mother.

00:31:52.246 --> 00:31:55.220
But then how to solve the problem?

00:32:01.026 --> 00:32:05.180
The problem can be solved if you become

00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.920
very powerful yourself within.

00:32:12.599 --> 00:32:14.700
Where is your attention?

00:32:18.986 --> 00:32:21.660
You have to move inward.

00:32:22.353 --> 00:32:24.380
Where is your attention?

00:32:26.293 --> 00:32:29.300
You have to become very powerful.

00:32:31.293 --> 00:32:35.660
I have done my job, I have given you Realization,

00:32:36.986 --> 00:32:39.340
you have grown so much.

00:32:39.846 --> 00:32:43.460
I have explained to you, I have
told you everything this time.

00:32:44.253 --> 00:32:46.940
I have given you lots of love,

00:32:48.313 --> 00:32:52.540
ocean of love I should say,
as you call it, whatever it is.

00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.860
But now you have to nourish yourself,

00:32:59.593 --> 00:33:03.026
you have to become powerful within yourself.

00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.620
So what is the way you can become powerful?

00:33:15.986 --> 00:33:18.567
First, you must believe

00:33:18.767 --> 00:33:21.460
that you have transcended

00:33:21.660 --> 00:33:27.653
your human personality and you 
have now become a super human being.

00:33:35.033 --> 00:33:37.900
First of all, this must come in you.

00:33:39.946 --> 00:33:43.060
This is what we call as faith.

00:33:43.673 --> 00:33:45.980
This faith is not false faith,

00:33:46.181 --> 00:33:50.540
it is not blind faith that
you believe into something,

00:33:52.220 --> 00:33:54.380
but it is a fact.

00:33:56.706 --> 00:33:59.060
I have, a hundred times, I have told you,

00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:04.660
that you have to have first
of all faith in your ascent,

00:34:04.860 --> 00:34:08.460
in your position as Sahaja Yogis.

00:34:11.693 --> 00:34:14.780
For this, meditation is very important,

00:34:16.613 --> 00:34:18.613
very important.

00:34:19.046 --> 00:34:23.980
Without meditation you
cannot have full faith in yourself.

00:34:25.633 --> 00:34:31.506
Because you can't know yourself,
by saying “who am I”? You cannot.

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:39.180
You try now asking the
question - who am I? You'll be lost.

00:34:47.707 --> 00:34:50.460
So what should be the faith then because

00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.746
when you ask this question
“who am I”?, you are lost.

00:35:01.426 --> 00:35:07.580
So, you reach a stage where I
have to tell you that faith is not mental,

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.300
it is not emotional,

00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:12.780
it is not physical,

00:35:12.980 --> 00:35:15.540
but it is a state

00:35:16.439 --> 00:35:18.700
of your own being

00:35:20.146 --> 00:35:24.060
which we can call as a spiritual state.

00:35:29.692 --> 00:35:32.580
In the spiritual state,

00:35:35.666 --> 00:35:41.060
nothing can disturb you,

00:35:43.487 --> 00:35:46.340
nothing can overpower you,

00:35:47.507 --> 00:35:50.660
nothing can dominate you,

00:35:52.980 --> 00:35:56.540
because that state if you have,

00:35:56.813 --> 00:36:02.460
that means you are part and parcel of reality,

00:36:04.426 --> 00:36:08.780
then you are an honoured member

00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.980
of the God's kingdom.

00:36:14.447 --> 00:36:16.780
Then you are

00:36:18.706 --> 00:36:23.860
the most revered personality.

00:36:24.906 --> 00:36:28.020
Then you are like a deity,

00:36:29.446 --> 00:36:32.300
then you are like a Gana.

00:36:34.286 --> 00:36:38.700
In that state, when you 
are, it's a state, again I say it,

00:36:39.740 --> 00:36:42.140
beyond the human state,

00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.246
you are extremely powerful.

00:36:56.613 --> 00:36:59.340
There is a story about Nizamuddin,

00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:03.700
the great Auliya, great Sufi in India.

00:37:03.953 --> 00:37:06.500
There was a horrible king,

00:37:06.953 --> 00:37:09.780
I think what- shah, he called himself.

00:37:10.793 --> 00:37:13.940
And he would not go and bow to him

00:37:14.866 --> 00:37:19.940
and he was very angry. He said, “I
can only bow to God and to nobody [else]".

00:37:21.646 --> 00:37:25.380
This Shah said, “If you don't
come and bow to me tomorrow,

00:37:25.899 --> 00:37:29.100
I will cut your throat”.

00:37:29.833 --> 00:37:33.660
And that night the throat of this king was cut.

00:37:35.493 --> 00:37:39.020
It is a story, but it is a real story.

00:37:41.633 --> 00:37:45.060
Somebody came and cut his throat, it was not

00:37:46.173 --> 00:37:49.453
Nizamuddin Sahab. He would not do that.

00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.180
So that state, if you reach,

00:37:58.606 --> 00:38:00.780
what we call,

00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:06.820
is a state of 'shraddha', [a] state of

00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:14.620
'shraddha' which is enlightened,

00:38:15.520 --> 00:38:18.180
enlightened faith.

00:38:20.746 --> 00:38:26.707
It is a new type of mechanism.

00:38:30.813 --> 00:38:32.820
That is,

00:38:33.786 --> 00:38:37.020
you become part and parcel of the whole;

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:43.060
that means the moon, the stars - see.

00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:48.700
I tell you, I never told the sun
that it should be there for the Pujas

00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:50.933
I never told last time, this time

00:38:51.133 --> 00:38:55.620
- I never tell him, there's 
no need to tell, it is all done.

00:38:58.546 --> 00:39:02.679
I don't tell all these vibrations

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:08.660
to make a cross or to show all
these miraculous photographs.

00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.780
I don't tell them, there's no need to tell.

00:39:15.393 --> 00:39:19.453
They just do it by themselves,
I am sometimes surprised

00:39:19.653 --> 00:39:22.620
how the ingenious methods they have of their own,

00:39:22.820 --> 00:39:25.540
how they manage things, I am myself surprised.

00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:31.400
I didn't tell them that these
two persons who were selected

00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:36.386
by this award that they should be
so condemned by every newspaper.

00:39:36.906 --> 00:39:39.820
It all works automatically,

00:39:43.686 --> 00:39:45.900
it just works.

00:39:46.813 --> 00:39:51.380
Only thing, if I have anything, is just complete,

00:39:51.580 --> 00:39:55.140
complete faith that I am at that state.

00:39:56.393 --> 00:40:00.820
And that's why there is complete
patience, 'saburi' [Marathi word].

00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.020
Complete patience.

00:40:09.313 --> 00:40:12.900
And that is what we have to learn.

00:40:14.326 --> 00:40:17.060
It will all happen in any case,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:20.260
because you are all at that state.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:24.620
Only meditation is important, very important.

00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:27.300
For me not, but for you all.

00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:33.780
If you all can meditate now, just

00:40:36.766 --> 00:40:39.900
for 10 minutes also every day,

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:42.686
it will help you a lot.

00:40:43.946 --> 00:40:47.213
Now why do we have all these statues?

00:40:48.233 --> 00:40:50.300
The Mother,

00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:55.740
Hanumana, and Ganesha, Christ.

00:40:56.720 --> 00:41:01.233
Because to begin with, human
beings cannot understand

00:41:01.433 --> 00:41:04.780
anything which does not have a form.

00:41:06.646 --> 00:41:11.100
They cannot go deeper
unless and until there is a form.

00:41:12.553 --> 00:41:18.060
But they went to another limit of using
any stone, anything as God and all.

00:41:21.433 --> 00:41:23.700
But now you have discretion,

00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:26.500
you know what is to be worshipped,

00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:31.100
what is to be treated as

00:41:31.480 --> 00:41:34.780
a higher personality, that you know.

00:41:36.020 --> 00:41:38.033
But before that,

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:41.373
they would worship all kinds of people like

00:41:41.573 --> 00:41:44.860
now people worship the
Pope, you know that, very well.

00:41:46.240 --> 00:41:48.279
But now what to do,

00:41:48.480 --> 00:41:51.240
they are not only blind,

00:41:51.873 --> 00:41:57.180
they are not only unaware, but
they are also not conscious of it.

00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.073
They are all at such a level
that you cannot tell them.

00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:07.100
So you are a new type of people, I should say,

00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:10.540
who have tried to fight it out,

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.773
to struggle it out, to know

00:42:14.453 --> 00:42:16.940
about the absolute truth.

00:42:18.613 --> 00:42:21.900
Unless and until you know the absolute truth,

00:42:24.346 --> 00:42:26.580
you are nowhere,

00:42:26.780 --> 00:42:31.980
you have no discretion, you have no
understanding, you have no wisdom.

00:42:34.033 --> 00:42:36.900
But once you know the absolute truth,

00:42:37.100 --> 00:42:41.620
then you should not by any chance

00:42:43.186 --> 00:42:46.220
be half way this and half way that.

00:42:46.906 --> 00:42:49.500
That's a very dangerous

00:42:52.366 --> 00:42:56.740
state of affairs. Say a seed is sprouted,

00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.420
it is neither a seed nor a tree.

00:43:04.266 --> 00:43:07.860
If it doesn't grow, it is useless.

00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.060
That happens to your awareness, I'm again talking

00:43:12.260 --> 00:43:15.740
of your consciousness, awareness

00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:24.000
- and then you are neither here nor there.

00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:27.340
There are many people

00:43:27.540 --> 00:43:29.700
who come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:35.260
perhaps maybe to find some peace.

00:43:36.740 --> 00:43:38.880
But I get letters,

00:43:39.153 --> 00:43:43.500
"My father is sick, my mother
is sick, my sister is sick".

00:43:43.919 --> 00:43:48.620
And then otherwise, "My husband is
fighting with me, I'm seeking a divorce"

00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:53.580
or thirdly, "I've lost all my
money, I must have some money".

00:43:54.399 --> 00:43:59.740
Fourthly, "I am a great
artist, but my art is not selling".

00:44:00.246 --> 00:44:05.460
All these stupid problems they bring.

00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.820
"My children are no good, they are troublesome,

00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:16.093
then my wife is fighting with me, my mother
is fighting with me, brother is fighting with me".

00:44:16.293 --> 00:44:19.293
Now I said, what sort of Sahaja Yogis these are?

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:29.900
The state of being one with the reality,

00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.940
means that the whole of reality is at your feet,

00:44:40.713 --> 00:44:42.940
the whole of it works for you.

00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:49.260
Now once you even get a glimpse of that state,

00:44:49.486 --> 00:44:54.060
I tell you, you become so much

00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.300
peaceful within yourself.

00:45:02.147 --> 00:45:05.100
If you say, "I am the king, I am the king".

00:45:06.013 --> 00:45:09.300
If you say, "I am the beggar, I am the beggar".

00:45:09.806 --> 00:45:12.940
What difference does it make to that state?

00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:18.420
It's is like the purest of pure gold,

00:45:18.919 --> 00:45:21.380
which cannot be tarnished.

00:45:25.712 --> 00:45:29.420
Such a state of mind we have to develop,

00:45:31.086 --> 00:45:34.500
it's more a challenge to us.

00:45:35.713 --> 00:45:38.020
We are Sahaja Yogis - all right.

00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:41.740
We have got Realization - all right.

00:45:42.773 --> 00:45:45.420
We can sing very well - all right.

00:45:46.213 --> 00:45:49.060
We have achieved good positions - all right.

00:45:50.613 --> 00:45:53.260
We are nicely married - all right.

00:45:54.160 --> 00:45:57.020
We have got nice children, we have got everything,

00:45:57.220 --> 00:46:00.453
we have got jobs, this, that - now.

00:46:01.506 --> 00:46:04.580
Suddenly one negative
force comes in to trouble you,

00:46:04.780 --> 00:46:06.780
"So what?

00:46:10.426 --> 00:46:12.426
So what?"

00:46:15.626 --> 00:46:18.740
Otherwise, how will you know what you are?

00:46:21.686 --> 00:46:25.420
If there is no darkness, how
will you know you are the light?

00:46:28.299 --> 00:46:30.560
It's a challenge

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:35.300
to your own state,

00:46:35.793 --> 00:46:38.593
at what state you are.

00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:44.140
The word ‘state’ is not so
explanatory. In Sanskrit, it is ‘svarupa’.

00:46:44.813 --> 00:46:46.820
‘Sva – rupa’ .

00:46:50.146 --> 00:46:53.693
‘Sva’ is your Self and ‘rupa’

00:46:54.113 --> 00:46:56.900
is form or state.

00:46:58.840 --> 00:47:04.500
That state is possible for all of you

00:47:06.999 --> 00:47:11.980
by saying, “Not this,
not this, not this, not this”.

00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:17.907
As it is, your mind

00:47:18.107 --> 00:47:21.767
has reached that state that there is no mind,

00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:24.313
you can do that.

00:47:25.433 --> 00:47:31.226
But you have to develop a kind of a personality

00:47:32.106 --> 00:47:34.980
that realizes what you are.

00:47:39.127 --> 00:47:41.860
But in that realization,

00:47:44.973 --> 00:47:47.580
you are just aware of it,

00:47:48.206 --> 00:47:50.279
not conscious of it.

00:47:50.493 --> 00:47:52.820
I'll, for example, I’ll tell you.

00:47:54.406 --> 00:47:58.300
I'm aware I am Adi Shakti, I am aware I know,

00:47:58.613 --> 00:48:04.260
but when you say, “Shri
Mataji”, I also say, “Jai Shri Mataji”.

00:48:04.460 --> 00:48:08.060
Forgetting that I am the
one you are talking about.

00:48:11.660 --> 00:48:16.420
This is actually, should be the state,

00:48:18.133 --> 00:48:21.880
that you are aware, yes,
you are aware in the sense,

00:48:22.759 --> 00:48:26.740
I don't know how to say, but
I'm aware I am that. If you ask me,

00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:30.060
“Mother, are you Adi Shakti?” I say, “Yes, I am“.

00:48:32.206 --> 00:48:35.180
Because I know that, that I am.

00:48:35.666 --> 00:48:40.700
But when you say, “Jai Shri
Mataji”, I forget that I am Adi Shakti

00:48:40.900 --> 00:48:44.220
and I also say, “Jai Shri Mataji” with you.

00:48:47.920 --> 00:48:51.133
I forget, I have to tell 
you, “No, no, you can’t say it”.

00:48:55.000 --> 00:49:00.420
It is very interesting. Now, you
make me sit here like a queen

00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:05.620
and give me presents, this
thing, that thing. I mean, all right,

00:49:06.380 --> 00:49:08.380
that's your idea.

00:49:11.360 --> 00:49:14.846
But to me, you see, I am

00:49:15.286 --> 00:49:18.340
complete in myself - I think so.

00:49:21.947 --> 00:49:26.780
This is in Hindi: "Me kahenge ki
hum apne hi andar samma gaye".

00:49:28.206 --> 00:49:32.700
"I am got lost into myself".

00:49:33.820 --> 00:49:37.392
All right, you do this, all right, 
you should do that, all right.

00:49:37.593 --> 00:49:40.379
If you don't do it, it's all right.

00:49:42.587 --> 00:49:45.860
To me, it makes no difference, 
it may make a difference to you,

00:49:46.525 --> 00:49:48.612
but to me it does not.

00:49:48.813 --> 00:49:54.085
Like, I've been saying, "That don't give me any
presents, don't give me any presents", all these days.

00:49:54.373 --> 00:49:58.260
So, the only argument is that,
"The whole year we give you once,

00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.060
so why should your Mother
object, because that gives us joy".

00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.180
All right, if you think it gives you joy, do it.

00:50:05.380 --> 00:50:08.140
But to me, it doesn't matter.

00:50:12.913 --> 00:50:16.020
Because, I don't think I am there.

00:50:19.033 --> 00:50:22.580
I'm just seeing you sitting here,

00:50:22.780 --> 00:50:27.340
"All right, they are all 
Realized souls, all right".

00:50:30.319 --> 00:50:32.580
But I am one of you.

00:50:34.313 --> 00:50:37.040
I don't think I am very special.

00:50:37.979 --> 00:50:40.300
But if you ask me,

00:50:40.693 --> 00:50:46.140
then I will say, "All right I am Adi Shakti".
But I don't think Adi Shakti is very special also.

00:50:49.706 --> 00:50:51.900
Because I have no mind.

00:50:52.340 --> 00:50:54.820
But otherwise, I don't 
think it's something special.

00:50:55.020 --> 00:50:58.080
Because somebody is somebody, so what?

00:50:59.246 --> 00:51:03.900
Now supposing, sun is sun, so what? He is the sun.

00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.620
If somebody is Adi Shakti, so Adi Shakti, so what?

00:51:11.666 --> 00:51:17.180
But for you it is creditable,
because you were not born Realized.

00:51:18.206 --> 00:51:20.580
You got your Realization,

00:51:22.100 --> 00:51:24.220
so you are special,

00:51:25.013 --> 00:51:28.220
you are great, you have achieved something.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:32.420
I have achieved nothing, I have
been like this and I will be like this.

00:51:36.306 --> 00:51:42.140
Whether I fight the devils, or I sit before
you, makes no difference, I will be like this.

00:51:42.746 --> 00:51:45.860
But for me, you are great

00:51:46.226 --> 00:51:48.653
because you have achieved this.

00:51:48.854 --> 00:51:52.500
Today, to see you on this Navaratri day,

00:51:52.700 --> 00:51:55.900
so many people sitting to worship me.

00:51:59.440 --> 00:52:01.820
So many people are here,

00:52:02.587 --> 00:52:05.020
so many Sahaja Yogis,

00:52:05.373 --> 00:52:07.460
it's so remarkable!

00:52:08.199 --> 00:52:12.300
It is not my achievement,
I tell you. It's your seeking.

00:52:12.600 --> 00:52:16.220
Because I have been on
this earth many a times before

00:52:18.226 --> 00:52:20.380
that you know.

00:52:20.653 --> 00:52:22.860
But we never had like this,

00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:26.900
so many came and got crucified, died, this, that

00:52:27.206 --> 00:52:29.840
- but I never had people of this kind.

00:52:32.512 --> 00:52:35.620
So again we come to the same point,

00:52:36.713 --> 00:52:40.180
that we should

00:52:41.433 --> 00:52:44.680
be aware of ourselves

00:52:45.686 --> 00:52:48.780
complete 'shraddha' in yourself.

00:52:49.386 --> 00:52:52.660
If you have some 'shraddha' in yourself,

00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.860
you will have 'shraddha' about Me also.

00:52:56.633 --> 00:52:59.100
Because we are not different.

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:05.260
If you believe this is water,

00:53:05.759 --> 00:53:09.860
then everywhere there is water
then I believe that that is water, isn't it?

00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.260
Because I know this is water,

00:53:14.453 --> 00:53:18.260
so wherever in the world 
there is water, I know it is water.

00:53:20.206 --> 00:53:23.106
So if you know you are a Sahaja Yogi,

00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:28.380
anywhere there is a Sahaja Yogi, you will
know there is a Sahaja Yogi, that's a Sahaja Yogi.

00:53:30.480 --> 00:53:33.900
But as far as you are concerned you forget

00:53:36.526 --> 00:53:40.680
how great you are and how far you can go.

00:53:41.180 --> 00:53:44.180
I am very proud of you, you don't know,

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:49.700
but because I am a humble person,

00:53:50.613 --> 00:53:53.060
I don't know how to show off.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:59.260
So I have such nice children, so many of them,

00:53:59.693 --> 00:54:02.000
so lovable,

00:54:03.986 --> 00:54:09.860
those bhaktas for whom she
killed so many demons and all that.

00:54:11.453 --> 00:54:13.493
They are not like you,

00:54:14.679 --> 00:54:20.340
you are much better, much
higher, of a much greater quality.

00:54:20.633 --> 00:54:24.780
But you must know that you are.

00:54:25.086 --> 00:54:30.860
And don't behave like those people who

00:54:31.233 --> 00:54:35.740
were of a very rudimentary nature.

00:54:36.380 --> 00:54:40.180
You have grown up, you have prospered

00:54:40.946 --> 00:54:44.046
and now the fruits, we can see.

00:54:46.993 --> 00:54:49.980
I don't know what to do for you really,

00:54:50.607 --> 00:54:53.940
but have faith in yourself,

00:54:56.525 --> 00:55:00.780
then you will see how much
faith you will have in reality.

00:55:00.980 --> 00:55:06.540
That there is reality with you
at every step, every moment.

00:55:10.812 --> 00:55:13.260
No fear,

00:55:16.193 --> 00:55:19.060
no sense of achievement, nothing!

00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:22.826
Done now, finished!

00:55:24.013 --> 00:55:28.385
When there were five Sahaja Yogis, I was
happy. When there are so many, I am happy.

00:55:28.586 --> 00:55:33.540
But when I see so many, I feel

00:55:35.259 --> 00:55:37.980
there are so many powerful

00:55:38.180 --> 00:55:42.560
personalities who are one with reality.

00:55:44.793 --> 00:55:48.700
This collective oneness,

00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:51.900
was never so.

00:55:52.833 --> 00:55:58.820
And so, I will say that on this day,

00:55:59.306 --> 00:56:03.660
what we have to do is to kill
the devils within ourselves.

00:56:05.906 --> 00:56:07.980
That's all.

00:56:09.113 --> 00:56:13.780
If you want to really worship
me, that's what you have to think,

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:18.380
what are the devils within you, that's all!

00:56:18.926 --> 00:56:23.926
So, you don't have to worry otherwise for
outside devils, they cannot do anything to you.

00:56:27.566 --> 00:56:29.760
May God bless you.
