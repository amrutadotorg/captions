00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:07.961
They have asked me to talk about Indian
culture today

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:15.155
because Bombay is the place where Indian
culture is disappearing,

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:18.035
that’s what they say.

00:00:18.236 --> 00:00:25.383
But I don’t think so, because the roots
are so deep

00:00:25.584 --> 00:00:32.892
that we cannot give up that culture
so fast.

00:00:33.467 --> 00:00:43.713
Now as it is for the people who are coming
from other countries,

00:00:43.914 --> 00:00:52.036
they have to realize that this country had
no religion as such,

00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:59.559
because there was not one book, they
didn’t follow one person.

00:01:01.738 --> 00:01:09.591
They didn’t have any organizations as we
have for other religions,

00:01:09.792 --> 00:01:14.633
we never had a hierarchy, priesthood,
all that appointed.

00:01:14.834 --> 00:01:18.072
It was all done very spontaneously.

00:01:18.273 --> 00:01:25.141
The whole thing worked out very
spontaneously.

00:01:25.342 --> 00:01:28.941
But behind all that was, as I told you
before,

00:01:29.142 --> 00:01:35.415
the attitude of Indians or our style was,

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:42.847
not to challenge or to question what these
great saints have talked about.

00:01:43.048 --> 00:01:47.159
Because we accepted their status as saints,

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:54.930
as higher personalities in awareness,
in ascent they were higher than us.

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:57.916
So we didn’t want to challenge them,

00:01:58.117 --> 00:02:01.380
and whatever they said we accepted.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.581
As a result that became sort of, you can
call it,

00:02:04.782 --> 00:02:10.845
a way of conduct or way of life.

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:14.402
But as a religion we had nothing,

00:02:14.603 --> 00:02:23.507
except that later on the caste system
developed.

00:02:23.708 --> 00:02:31.410
Before that there was no caste system
because non-Brahmins wrote

00:02:31.611 --> 00:02:38.367
about Shri Rama or wrote about
Shri Krishna.

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:44.185
It’s very surprising how we accepted
all that,

00:02:44.386 --> 00:02:49.755
never challenged whether it was written
by a Brahmin or not.

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:54.262
Brahmin was that who knew about Brahma
principle,

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.384
the principle of all-pervading Divine Love.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.284
Everybody was not a Brahmin.

00:03:01.485 --> 00:03:06.934
But later on they made it like this,
whosoever is born

00:03:07.143 --> 00:03:10.510
in a Brahmin family was a Brahmin,

00:03:10.711 --> 00:03:16.404
whosoever was born in another caste
belonged to that.

00:03:16.621 --> 00:03:23.762
But because of the father’s heritance,
you can say inherited,

00:03:23.963 --> 00:03:30.435
they also the profession that they wer
following.

00:03:30.636 --> 00:03:35.297
So according to the professions,
the religions, or we can say the castes

00:03:35.498 --> 00:03:38.788
were established; no religion, but caste.

00:03:38.996 --> 00:03:43.203
And that is how we had different, different
caste systems in India

00:03:43.411 --> 00:03:48.673
according to the professions. It is very
interesting.

00:03:48.874 --> 00:03:55.715
Recently, I discovered there is a caste
called Ghadani,

00:03:55.916 --> 00:03:59.163
among Marathas, which you may not be
knowing.

00:03:59.364 --> 00:04:05.256
They only believe in the art.

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:12.064
They do music, or they have paintings,
they make statues,

00:04:12.265 --> 00:04:18.866
they make temples; that’s a caste,
that’s a profession.

00:04:19.067 --> 00:04:23.005
And they marry among themselves because
it is easier

00:04:23.206 --> 00:04:30.784
to marry in the same profession and to have
the same ideas

00:04:30.985 --> 00:04:37.682
and styles about life and the profession
especially.

00:04:37.883 --> 00:04:41.805
Now later on, apart from being
a profession,

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:46.428
it started becoming a very consolidated
nonsense.

00:04:46.629 --> 00:04:53.189
And then they used, I mean I think, it is
the British who used it very much

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.120
to separate us from one to another.

00:04:57.321 --> 00:05:04.398
Now the schedule caste and all that was
not also like a rigid thing.

00:05:04.607 --> 00:05:08.385
We have got saints like Chokha Mela and
all that,

00:05:08.586 --> 00:05:14.226
who were also greatly respected and
regarded.

00:05:14.427 --> 00:05:21.675
Also Ekanath, Namdev, they all tried to be
one

00:05:21.876 --> 00:05:27.330
with all the castes, and especially
the schedule caste.

00:05:27.531 --> 00:05:34.844
So this saintliness was regarded as
a another caste you can say,

00:05:35.045 --> 00:05:39.588
which did not believe in any caste
whatsoever.

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.163
They had no caste, they were a caste-less
people

00:05:43.364 --> 00:05:48.604
without any religion, without any caste.

00:05:48.805 --> 00:05:54.388
So the ultimate aim of every caste was
to get to Self Realization.

00:05:54.589 --> 00:06:01.370
So they enter into the clan, you can call
it, into the system of saints.

00:06:01.586 --> 00:06:09.014
And all the saints, whether Muslims, or
Hindus or Jains or anything,

00:06:09.230 --> 00:06:16.615
they all were put together as saints,
as you can say they were Sufis.

00:06:16.816 --> 00:06:23.086
Sufis from the Muslim heritage they came.

00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:28.667
Then we had also among Jains, Tirthankaras
and all that.

00:06:28.868 --> 00:06:37.960
The main point was that they were the people
who believed in the ethical life, ethics;

00:06:38.161 --> 00:06:49.310
believed in the higher life, spiritual life
and lived like that.

00:06:49.511 --> 00:06:53.309
Now as you are all Sahaja Yogis, you have
lost your religion,

00:06:53.510 --> 00:06:58.310
lost your caste, you have lost everything.
You are Sahaja Yogis.

00:06:58.511 --> 00:07:09.265
Yogis, means you are the people who are
believing into the ethical side of life.

00:07:09.473 --> 00:07:18.611
In this country all this was used and was
exploited also,

00:07:18.812 --> 00:07:28.194
for politics, for all kinds of segregation
of people.

00:07:28.395 --> 00:07:37.004
And that has really gone into such rigid
ideas about every one, every caste,

00:07:37.213 --> 00:07:45.759
that first thing they used to ask, not now,
before, ‘What is your caste?’

00:07:46.038 --> 00:07:49.636
Now that’s over, they don’t ask, at least
thank God,

00:07:49.837 --> 00:07:54.542
that much sense is there, that they don’t
ask for the caste,

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:58.656
but they used to ask religion and caste
formerly

00:07:58.857 --> 00:08:05.171
when we were entering into any examination
or any kind of competition.

00:08:05.372 --> 00:08:12.299
Now gradually it’s vanishing, but the
politicians wants to use caste

00:08:12.539 --> 00:08:23.159
as a method of working out the opposition
and the majority part of it.

00:08:23.367 --> 00:08:27.976
This democracy I don’t think is very
helpful to us

00:08:28.177 --> 00:08:34.221
because in democracy anybody can start
an organization,

00:08:34.422 --> 00:08:38.689
can say that, “We belong to this caste
and that caste.”

00:08:38.890 --> 00:08:43.948
And when the constitution was made also
in this country, it’s very surprising,

00:08:44.164 --> 00:08:47.863
Ambedkar was one of them who wanted

00:08:48.064 --> 00:08:53.766
that there should be a privilege for
the schedule caste for forty years.

00:08:53.967 --> 00:08:56.864
My father was there. He said, ‘No,

00:08:57.065 --> 00:09:03.090
you can have only two types, ones who
have and those who don’t have.’

00:09:03.291 --> 00:09:08.232
And that kind of thing if you have: those
who have and don’t have,

00:09:08.433 --> 00:09:11.599
it would make such a difference.

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:16.747
Then in other countries they have
the same type,

00:09:16.948 --> 00:09:24.523
so that the needs of the people who
haven’t got the minimum necessities

00:09:24.724 --> 00:09:29.527
for a good life will be helped instead
of creating a caste.

00:09:29.728 --> 00:09:37.618
Now there’s one fellow called Mandal who
created a great problem in our country.

00:09:37.842 --> 00:09:44.138
He as a student had a car of his own, used
to live very lavishly,

00:09:44.339 --> 00:09:51.058
and he was fighting for some people who
were supposed to be downtrodden.

00:09:51.259 --> 00:09:56.588
And so many bad things have been done
because of his report that he gave.

00:09:56.789 --> 00:10:05.558
Now if he had made that kind of a proper,
sensible, ethical division in this country,

00:10:05.759 --> 00:10:09.037
things would have been much better.

00:10:09.238 --> 00:10:16.339
But now because of this problem of creating
artificial caste,

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:19.636
this country is suffering a lot.

00:10:19.837 --> 00:10:26.955
And the caste of the gurus, the caste,
we can say, of the Sufis,

00:10:27.156 --> 00:10:32.451
or the caste of the saints is very much
polluted,

00:10:32.652 --> 00:10:41.201
and we had many people in our country who
started becoming gurus and this and that.

00:10:41.402 --> 00:10:47.971
But the main thing is the ethics, which was
the culture of this country,

00:10:48.172 --> 00:10:51.867
was the ethics - Aadhyatama.

00:10:52.068 --> 00:10:59.098
Without that they thought human beings
were worse than animals.

00:10:59.299 --> 00:11:06.837
Ethics was very important to every caste,
to every person.

00:11:07.043 --> 00:11:11.857
Even when I was young we had the same
thing.

00:11:12.058 --> 00:11:19.611
But now it has become such a mixture
and such a problem,

00:11:19.812 --> 00:11:24.856
that unless and until Sahaja Yoga really
spreads in a real way,

00:11:25.064 --> 00:11:32.150
I don’t think we can improve the condition
of this country.

00:11:32.365 --> 00:11:39.550
Now the essence of it is that once your
attention is only

00:11:39.798 --> 00:11:43.623
towards ethics and Aadhyatama (MEANS
spirituality -ed),

00:11:43.824 --> 00:11:53.104
then you start discovering all the inner
deeper meanings of your life.

00:11:53.305 --> 00:11:56.826
You work it out in a different way.

00:11:57.027 --> 00:12:00.364
In a very different way you work it out.

00:12:00.565 --> 00:12:08.432
If it is material gain, then one can become
like America.

00:12:08.688 --> 00:12:18.126
If it is some sort of a very low level
hankerings,

00:12:18.327 --> 00:12:22.932
then also you cannot be an Indian.

00:12:23.133 --> 00:12:35.468
The principles of Indian life were embedded
in spirituality, in morality.

00:12:35.669 --> 00:12:42.608
An immoral person was regarded as a very
low level person.

00:12:42.809 --> 00:12:47.734
Such a person could not get married, he had
no place in the society,

00:12:47.935 --> 00:12:54.202
he had no place even in the homes, their
own homes.

00:12:54.821 --> 00:13:06.093
That such a restriction on people, just
to see that the society is kept clean,

00:13:06.294 --> 00:13:10.882
and such a person was thrown out
of the society.

00:13:11.342 --> 00:13:16.826
Anybody who even drank wine or anything,

00:13:17.027 --> 00:13:22.785
was regarded as a person who is not
dharmic, he is adharmic.

00:13:22.986 --> 00:13:24.908
Can you believe it?

00:13:25.116 --> 00:13:29.691
Drinking was regarded as adharmic.
I think very few people

00:13:29.892 --> 00:13:35.251
must have seen drunkards, only
on the streets.

00:13:35.452 --> 00:13:41.919
When I went to Russia they asked Me,
“What do you say to ‘cheers’?”

00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:45.960
The Russians say ‘cheerio’, they don’t
say ‘cheers’.

00:13:46.176 --> 00:13:48.738
I said, “What? Cheers for what?”

00:13:48.939 --> 00:13:54.386
“For drinking. When you are on the table,
what do you say?”

00:13:54.587 --> 00:13:59.520
I said, “We never drink on the dinner
table,

00:13:59.721 --> 00:14:04.260
that’s not done in India. At least, I don’t
know if somebody does it.

00:14:04.461 --> 00:14:09.345
But it is a very, very western style
of life

00:14:09.546 --> 00:14:13.647
that openly you sit down at the dinner
table before your children

00:14:13.848 --> 00:14:20.386
and start drinking, and say ‘cheers’.
Immagine.

00:14:20.587 --> 00:14:26.738
Cheers for what? For becoming unconscious?

00:14:26.939 --> 00:14:33.009
For becoming stupid? For getting into
troubles?

00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:38.864
But it became like a practice there.

00:14:39.065 --> 00:14:46.021
Whether somebody dies in the family, they
will drink. Can you imagine?

00:14:46.395 --> 00:14:51.558
If somebody is born in the family they
will drink.

00:14:51.759 --> 00:14:55.856
So this culture, the whole culture was
so bad,

00:14:56.078 --> 00:15:02.899
even among the worst in this country
they wouldn’t do that.

00:15:04.288 --> 00:15:09.825
Secretly some people used to drink, and
they would go on the street.

00:15:10.026 --> 00:15:12.530
Then the Islamic influence came.

00:15:12.731 --> 00:15:18.483
And surprisingly when it is prohibited,
absolutely prohibited,

00:15:18.684 --> 00:15:23.500
in the Islam, to drink, they all started
drinking

00:15:23.701 --> 00:15:28.280
as a reaction, but only those Nawabs
and all that.

00:15:28.481 --> 00:15:32.404
And because of them, because they were
in authority,

00:15:32.605 --> 00:15:34.728
others also took to drinking.

00:15:34.929 --> 00:15:41.421
But still, it is not yet a custom to drink,
to celebrate something.

00:15:41.622 --> 00:15:47.800
I mean supposing, even in the church
they give drinks

00:15:48.001 --> 00:15:53.267
and they make also some sort
of a Benedictine,

00:15:53.468 --> 00:15:58.668
in the church organization. Imagine!

00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:04.845
This is such a perversion of religion.

00:16:05.505 --> 00:16:07.837
In India also, in the temples and all that

00:16:08.038 --> 00:16:11.990
they started all kinds of nonsensical
things, no doubt.

00:16:12.191 --> 00:16:17.871
But Indian philosophy is such that it gives
you complete freedom

00:16:18.072 --> 00:16:22.837
and you can do what you like. But not
in the name of religion,

00:16:23.038 --> 00:16:29.365
you can’t do it, not in the name of God,
not in the temple.

00:16:29.566 --> 00:16:34.097
And if they do it, people will throw them
away,

00:16:34.298 --> 00:16:41.007
they bring a court case, do this do that
and, I mean, just remove it completely.

00:16:41.208 --> 00:16:45.374
So it is kept pure.

00:16:45.574 --> 00:16:51.638
We had a horrible incidence of horrible
things people were doing, adharmic,

00:16:51.839 --> 00:16:56.914
but all that had to be cancelled
completely. Why?

00:16:57.122 --> 00:17:03.300
Because the people wouldn’t have it, people
wouldn’t like it.

00:17:03.501 --> 00:17:08.489
I was told that at Ganapatipule they are
secretly offering

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.577
some sort of a beer to people.

00:17:11.778 --> 00:17:16.088
But if the government comes to know
about it, it will be banned.

00:17:16.289 --> 00:17:20.501
I mean, whatever is pure must be kept pure.

00:17:20.702 --> 00:17:23.018
Christ, also, He took one hunter in his
hand

00:17:23.242 --> 00:17:28.539
and started hitting people who were selling
things in the temple.

00:17:29.087 --> 00:17:37.957
So the purity of that church or the purity
of that religious place have to be kept.

00:17:38.158 --> 00:17:42.733
So the first thing I think was purity.

00:17:44.337 --> 00:17:52.446
Here now I have seen, the other day,
there was a boy, was for marriage.

00:17:53.076 --> 00:17:58.903
And it’s very surprising, they were all
very well off,

00:17:59.104 --> 00:18:02.716
very rich, everything was there.

00:18:02.917 --> 00:18:08.316
But they found out that he had
a girlfriend before.

00:18:08.517 --> 00:18:13.107
And the brother of the girlfriend tried
to stab him. Finished.

00:18:13.308 --> 00:18:17.794
Now for him to get married is an
impossibility in this country.

00:18:17.995 --> 00:18:21.768
He might get somebody from abroad, I don’t
know what they will do.

00:18:21.969 --> 00:18:29.107
But if he had a girlfriend like that,
openly, he is finished.

00:18:29.308 --> 00:18:32.914
So the restrictions came from the society,

00:18:33.115 --> 00:18:37.619
a society which was built up on ethics.

00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:43.502
And all these ethical values arepenetrating

00:18:43.718 --> 00:18:48.586
up to the lowest level, up to everywhere.

00:18:50.438 --> 00:18:54.085
But unfortunately, unfortunately

00:18:54.301 --> 00:18:58.179
now the other cultures are coming and
people think

00:18:58.379 --> 00:19:04.506
it's, it's - we are rather rigid, very
rigid people.

00:19:04.715 --> 00:19:09.748
We should really relax a little bit and
take to other things.

00:19:19.447 --> 00:19:22.835
But I have to tell you

00:19:24.106 --> 00:19:35.267
that if you go out of the line of ethics,
in any direction,

00:19:35.468 --> 00:19:40.451
the only saving is Sahaja Yoga to come back
to normalcy,

00:19:40.652 --> 00:19:42.659
there is no other way out.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:48.827
And once you come to Sahaja Yoga you cannot
deviate from the path of dharma.

00:19:49.028 --> 00:19:53.334
If you try to do that you go out of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:19:53.535 --> 00:19:57.274
It is as simple as that.

00:19:57.475 --> 00:20:00.948
It is not that, ‘All right, doesn’t matter.

00:20:01.149 --> 00:20:06.586
Mother should forgive.’ and these things.
I forgive, all right, I forgive,

00:20:06.787 --> 00:20:11.815
because you have got some still human
weaknesses left in you, I forgive.

00:20:12.024 --> 00:20:15.445
But in Sahaja Yoga you cannot come.

00:20:15.646 --> 00:20:20.101
Sahaja Yoga has to maintain its purity.

00:20:20.302 --> 00:20:25.552
If you allow all such people to enter
into Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:25.753 --> 00:20:31.177
then there will be no purity of Sahaja Yoga

00:20:31.378 --> 00:20:34.728
and then everybody will start doing this
or that

00:20:34.929 --> 00:20:40.020
just to say that, ‘After all, you see, we
are also Sahaja Yogis,

00:20:40.221 --> 00:20:46.613
they are also Sahaja Yogis, if they have
done it, why not we?’

00:20:46.814 --> 00:20:50.857
What is very surprising to Me is
the western people

00:20:51.058 --> 00:20:56.893
who have taken to Sahaja Yoga are
scrupulously following Sahaja Yoga.

00:20:57.094 --> 00:21:03.580
Scrupulously. I am not such a strict Guru,
as you know.

00:21:03.781 --> 00:21:09.912
But they understand one thing, that “this
is for our betterment,

00:21:10.113 --> 00:21:14.017
this is for our growth,

00:21:14.218 --> 00:21:25.268
this is a very, very important part of our
lives, that is ethics.

00:21:25.469 --> 00:21:28.161
That has to be there.”

00:21:28.362 --> 00:21:32.850
And once they understand it, I tell you,
I am surprised

00:21:33.051 --> 00:21:39.770
how these western people who have seen
their parents drinking,

00:21:39.971 --> 00:21:44.045
and also other people doing all kinds
of things,

00:21:44.246 --> 00:21:49.835
even their friends and all that, just
give up, completely.

00:21:50.036 --> 00:21:52.505
I am very proud of them.

00:21:52.706 --> 00:21:58.569
For us Indians, it is natural, because we
are brought up that way.

00:21:58.769 --> 00:22:03.921
All the time we have seen people being
corrected and,

00:22:04.122 --> 00:22:07.831
I mean of course drinking and all that
was of course not out of question.

00:22:08.032 --> 00:22:11.170
But even if somebody looks at a girl,
you know,

00:22:11.371 --> 00:22:16.821
the father would say, ‘I will pierce
through your eyes!’

00:22:17.022 --> 00:22:21.563
I mean. And that’s why the eyes remain
steady,

00:22:21.764 --> 00:22:28.101
and I don’t know how but we don’t do
all that. Normally.

00:22:28.302 --> 00:22:32.723
I mean if somebody has been abroad
and all that

00:22:32.924 --> 00:22:36.856
and thinks that they are very free people
and why not we can do,

00:22:37.057 --> 00:22:42.738
that’s a very different thing. But normally
we don’t, we don’t believe in that.

00:22:42.939 --> 00:22:48.809
Of course in India we do have some elite
societies, so called;

00:22:49.326 --> 00:22:53.227
they are the people who believe in all
kinds of elite behavior.

00:22:53.428 --> 00:22:56.367
I don’t know what is that supposed to be.

00:22:56.568 --> 00:23:03.483
Maybe some of them have started some
nonsense, especially in Bombay.

00:23:03.684 --> 00:23:07.867
Now it is spreading out also to Poona.

00:23:08.068 --> 00:23:12.406
And in Poona there are girls who are
behaving funnily.

00:23:12.607 --> 00:23:16.403
I mean I can’t believe it. They drink,
they smoke,

00:23:16.604 --> 00:23:20.787
they have become call-girls. Can you
imagine?

00:23:23.387 --> 00:23:27.078
All this has happened

00:23:27.279 --> 00:23:33.182
because I don’t know what is their idea
about life.

00:23:33.382 --> 00:23:37.910
Or maybe it’s an actress or something they
follow,

00:23:38.111 --> 00:23:42.098
but what is the life of that actress?

00:23:43.107 --> 00:23:48.756
Unethical behavior, when you compromise
with your value system,

00:23:48.965 --> 00:23:52.943
ultimately, where do you end?

00:23:56.094 --> 00:24:01.256
It’s showing results. We have AIDS, we have
so many diseases

00:24:01.457 --> 00:24:09.676
coming from this kind of irrelevant,
unethical life.

00:24:12.534 --> 00:24:19.357
It is happening everywhere to suggest that
we should take to very normal life,

00:24:19.558 --> 00:24:29.392
to very good family life of obedience and
understanding.

00:24:29.948 --> 00:24:39.328
But because you are very free in the West
it is difficult for you to accept,

00:24:39.529 --> 00:24:46.512
but once they come to Sahaja Yoga I am
really surprised, I am really surprised,

00:24:46.713 --> 00:24:53.596
how they have accepted Sahaja Yoga
so beautifully.

00:24:53.797 --> 00:24:58.410
They had the freedom, complete freedom
to do what they liked.

00:24:58.619 --> 00:25:01.418
In India we don’t have such freedom
for children.

00:25:01.626 --> 00:25:04.875
They can go wherever they like, they
can do whatever they like,

00:25:05.076 --> 00:25:08.302
the teacher cannot correct them.

00:25:08.779 --> 00:25:12.296
Because of that freedom that they had,

00:25:12.497 --> 00:25:17.086
there’s one thing good that has happened.
So many are lost, all right,

00:25:17.287 --> 00:25:21.972
but those who are saved are rare people.

00:25:22.173 --> 00:25:27.112
Because of that growth of freedom within
them I think

00:25:27.313 --> 00:25:34.294
they learn our Indian music in five months,
four months. No Indians can do it

00:25:34.595 --> 00:25:37.917
because they are restricted all the time,
they are controlled all the time,

00:25:38.118 --> 00:25:43.072
they are kept on the path of religion.

00:25:43.273 --> 00:25:50.286
So ultimately the freedom that some of you
had and enjoyed

00:25:50.495 --> 00:25:54.696
has given you a special personality

00:25:54.897 --> 00:25:59.869
that you pick up very difficult things
without any difficulty.

00:26:00.307 --> 00:26:06.070
Now whether you should have that freedom
or not is your own lookout.

00:26:06.271 --> 00:26:12.957
But too much restrictions on children,
I think, is not a good thing.

00:26:14.021 --> 00:26:19.423
Now in music, I know, Ravi Shankar when
he was young,

00:26:19.624 --> 00:26:24.000
his guru had broken a tanpura on his head

00:26:24.201 --> 00:26:31.673
because he put a wrong note, swara. Can you
imagine?

00:26:31.874 --> 00:26:36.751
They used to beat them, tie them upside
down,

00:26:36.952 --> 00:26:42.344
put them in the well, I mean all kinds
of things they did

00:26:42.545 --> 00:26:48.139
and the disciples listened to all that
discipline. Can you imagine?

00:26:48.340 --> 00:26:57.612
But I think that curbed their capacity
to absorb something difficult.

00:26:57.813 --> 00:27:03.248
This is one of the reasons why I see this
has happened,

00:27:03.449 --> 00:27:07.689
that people have picked up this difficult
music

00:27:07.890 --> 00:27:12.457
in four months, three months, it’s
a miracle we think.

00:27:12.658 --> 00:27:16.383
Why not this happens with Indians?

00:27:17.691 --> 00:27:24.069
You put them to anything, they pick it up
so fast.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:28.188
With Sahaja Yoga, born with Sahaja Yoga,
those who are,

00:27:28.389 --> 00:27:31.055
should be given full freedom I think.

00:27:31.256 --> 00:27:35.058
Such children should be given full freedom

00:27:35.259 --> 00:27:37.470
for they will not do anything wrong.

00:27:37.671 --> 00:27:43.679
And you will see they will pick up things
very fast.

00:27:44.585 --> 00:27:49.153
Not that westerners are more intelligent
or alert,

00:27:49.354 --> 00:27:58.927
but the way they are given freedom, their
growth, their personality.

00:27:59.143 --> 00:28:02.223
Sometimes they are like a vagabond,
I think.

00:28:02.432 --> 00:28:09.715
Sometimes just like a tomboy, sometimes
to me they look like very vulgar.

00:28:09.916 --> 00:28:22.364
But once with that wealth of freedom they
come to reality, they shine.

00:28:22.565 --> 00:28:28.650
So I would request also Indians, not
to suppress the children too much.

00:28:28.851 --> 00:28:33.170
We enjoy the children very much in India,
no doubt,

00:28:33.371 --> 00:28:37.388
but we suppress also them, very much.

00:28:37.596 --> 00:28:40.457
‘Why are you standing? Why don’t you sit
down? Why...’

00:28:40.658 --> 00:28:42.810
And children don’t mind because it is
accepted,

00:28:43.024 --> 00:28:46.258
this pattern is accepted in India.

00:28:46.490 --> 00:28:52.891
So too much restriction on children also
curbs their personality,

00:28:53.092 --> 00:28:56.690
this is what I have discovered.

00:28:57.134 --> 00:29:01.636
But the western people go through such hell
first of all,

00:29:01.853 --> 00:29:05.880
develop such problems to begin with

00:29:06.081 --> 00:29:10.313
and ultimately what happens is this,

00:29:11.735 --> 00:29:17.035
that they can be discarded as bad, bad,
bad people.

00:29:17.244 --> 00:29:22.957
But if they come as good, good, good, they
are marvelous.

00:29:23.602 --> 00:29:28.946
All the freedom they have enjoyed before
is showing results,

00:29:29.147 --> 00:29:34.350
otherwise how can this miracle happen
to western people.

00:29:34.955 --> 00:29:41.126
There is no justification. Now the problem
is to give freedom or not.

00:29:45.166 --> 00:29:55.563
We have a proper sense now, after
Realization,

00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:03.310
that a child is a born realized.

00:30:03.511 --> 00:30:08.042
In the beginning he won’t understand,
he won’t understand.

00:30:08.243 --> 00:30:13.353
But gradually such a child will show
results,

00:30:13.553 --> 00:30:19.837
maximum capacity to absorb and to express.

00:30:21.298 --> 00:30:26.439
So today I am telling you about this
freedom,

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:30.538
which is the freedom of the Spirit.

00:30:30.739 --> 00:30:36.170
We should have understanding of such
children

00:30:36.371 --> 00:30:43.251
who have that spirituality in them.

00:30:44.023 --> 00:30:46.176
They have dharma in them.

00:30:46.385 --> 00:30:53.331
And we should not try to constrict them
or to trouble them.

00:30:53.532 --> 00:30:57.113
Let them do what they like.

00:30:57.314 --> 00:31:01.567
They’ll never do anything wrong because
they are born realized.

00:31:01.768 --> 00:31:06.528
So I am talking about the future Indians.

00:31:06.729 --> 00:31:09.984
Some of them I have seen, eight year old
children,

00:31:10.185 --> 00:31:15.458
six year old children, they are geniuses,
I tell you.

00:31:15.659 --> 00:31:22.598
They sing as if we feel that these old
musicians are reborn or what.

00:31:23.054 --> 00:31:30.999
It is very surprising how they show their
talent.

00:31:31.208 --> 00:31:36.225
There was a programme I saw on the
television of children below eight years

00:31:36.426 --> 00:31:42.650
and a three year old girl singing just like
Hirabai Barodekar.

00:31:42.851 --> 00:31:46.055
I was amazed. They are born realized

00:31:46.256 --> 00:31:52.551
but also they have the talents from their
past lives.

00:31:52.802 --> 00:31:56.686
They have got it from the past life.

00:31:57.481 --> 00:32:04.087
So we should not try to control and check
our children too much,

00:32:04.288 --> 00:32:09.501
that’s a part of our Sahaj culture.

00:32:09.701 --> 00:32:12.663
It doesn’t fit into Indian culture, I must
say,

00:32:12.879 --> 00:32:16.126
but it should fit into Sahaj culture,

00:32:16.327 --> 00:32:24.549
to understand the value of our children
who are realized souls.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:29.775
I enjoy their company, they speak so
sweetly of all the things,

00:32:29.976 --> 00:32:36.218
of all the persons, and they describe about
everyone so sweetly.

00:32:36.419 --> 00:32:39.104
Just allow them the freedom to talk

00:32:39.305 --> 00:32:43.359
and they’ll tell you all kinds of things.

00:32:45.402 --> 00:32:51.865
Now I have praised you a lot I think.

00:32:52.066 --> 00:32:59.085
The outsiders we can call them, not
Indians, non-Indians.

00:32:59.285 --> 00:33:06.779
And it is a fact, the way they have taken
to Sahaja Yoga is remarkable.

00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:12.799
But the way they are taking to this Indian
music and to Indian art

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:21.627
I can’t believe it, really I can’t believe
it. I can’t understand it.

00:33:23.303 --> 00:33:27.136
So you have freedom,

00:33:27.346 --> 00:33:32.968
but now use this freedom for expression

00:33:33.183 --> 00:33:37.456
of whatever you have achieved in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:33:39.069 --> 00:33:42.757
Because you are already grown up with
your freedom

00:33:42.958 --> 00:33:49.326
and if you do not utilize that personality
full of freedom

00:33:49.527 --> 00:33:56.771
in expressing Sahaja Yoga in your own
languages,

00:33:56.978 --> 00:33:59.822
you won’t help your people.

00:34:00.023 --> 00:34:05.208
You have to help them because your
percentage is very low,

00:34:05.409 --> 00:34:07.997
your quality is high.

00:34:08.198 --> 00:34:11.644
But in your own country your percentage
is low.

00:34:11.845 --> 00:34:18.206
So you have to go all out to get them
into Sahaja Yoga

00:34:18.407 --> 00:34:26.310
So you have to go all out to get them
into Sahaja Yoga

00:34:26.739 --> 00:34:30.432
You are duty bound, I think.
