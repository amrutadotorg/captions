00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:08.290
I bow to all seekers of truth.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:17.689
These are the special times when so many seekers
are born all over the world.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:27.670
We are not aware as to the nature of this
time, when we get so much worried, anxious

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:38.350
and upset with so many things happening around
us and we do not find any answer to it.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:47.370
Sometimes if you read some of the books which
give all the datas about what is expected

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:56.430
of human beings many people have now, I think,
accepted the ultimate doom and they think

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:02.970
that after all the doom has to come so why
worry.

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.720
Even Mohammad Sahib has talked about the doomsday
but much more than that he has talked about

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.720
the days of resurrection.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.780
They all have talked about the future, the
day of judgement, the day of resurrection.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.370
When is this going to happen and how it is
going to happen?

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.910
We have to first of all know that why are
we seekers and what are we seeking?

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:40.789
When I said that you are the seekers of truth
we have to find out first of all what is the

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.640
truth, and for that finding out we have to
just use some logic, we have to come to some

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.360
logical conclusion.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:58.720
Now the first thing one must know that we
have become human beings from amoeba stage.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.100
We have come to this stage with a purpose,
it is not purposeless.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.520
But why have we become a human being?

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.349
There must be some purpose and if this purpose
has to be served it will be served not by

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:22.089
some sort of an outward happening but something
inward has to happen to our awareness.

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:28.860
Like animals do not have any awareness of
cleanliness, of beauty, but human beings have.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.469
In the same way when we become a higher personality
we have to have something happening, happening

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.430
again I say, to our awareness.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:45.579
And for this I would say Jung has done lot
of work, Jung who opposed Freud very much

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:55.299
and he said that if man has to evolve little
higher than what he is he will achieve his

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:02.680
own goal and according to him also the goal
of man is to become collectively conscious.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:10.719
So even the scientists, the psychologists
have prepared the stage for our ascent.

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:17.069
Even Darwin who did not believe in God but
he did say that, " If man has come so far

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:24.238
he has to go still further somewhere at his
destination."

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:31.299
Even he would not accept a situation or a
proposition in which one has to say that there

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.549
is no purpose of nature in creating human
beings.

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.510
The second conclusion we have to come to very
logically, understandingly, is that the process

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.279
of evolution has been done by the living force
of life.

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:50.819
It's not done by something which is dead.

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:55.988
Like supposing we read the book it's all dead
work or if we stand on our heads or do any

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.709
such things we don't create anything.

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:06.269
Living thing can be understood from, living
process can be understood from a living thing.

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.900
Like if you have got a seed and it looks like
a dead thing but you put it in the mother

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.220
earth then it starts sprouting by itself,
spontaneously.

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.389
How it happens, why it happens we can't explain,
but it does.

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:27.090
You see for yourself that it happens and that
kind of a living force has worked out your

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.489
evolution without your knowledge but now in
your knowledge it has to happen.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.050
That's the only difference between the evolutionary
process so far and further, and because it

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:45.620
has to be in your knowledge you are given
complete freedom to choose either the ascent

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:46.930
or the descent.

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:53.120
And when you come to this right conclusion
that it has to be done through some living

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:01.039
process then you must understand another point
that you cannot pay for it, not a single pi.

00:05:01.039 --> 00:05:05.349
Because this is something very difficult for
human beings to understand that you can get

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.599
something without paying but you are getting
something.

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:11.770
You get the sun's rays without paying for
it.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.169
Everything, this pay business and all, this
economic activity has been started by human

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.170
beings alone.

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.490
It's not done by God and perhaps God never
understands money at all but is all done by

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:28.469
human beings and also they want to bring in
God into the same pattern and say that you

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:29.490
can sell God.

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:33.330
You cannot organise God and you cannot sell
God.

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:39.169
So another conclusion we have to reach that
we cannot purchase God or His Divine Power,

00:05:39.169 --> 00:05:43.460
this has to be brought to us spontaneously.

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:52.659
Means that we cannot sort of work it out ourselves,
it's some sort of a grace or we can say a

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:58.629
force that has to work it and when that grace
works it out we can become a higher personality

00:05:58.629 --> 00:06:04.990
as we have become higher personality so far.

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:11.449
Now this grace about which people have talked
that there is an all-pervading power everywhere

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:16.680
and this all-pervading power is doing every
living work.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:24.240
Like again I say when the living process where
we see a flower becoming a fruit, thousands

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:27.870
and thousands flowers we see are becoming
fruits.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:28.870
How do they become?

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:31.740
They become spontaneously, but how?

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.840
A flower just becomes a fruit, we take it
for granted.

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:44.109
Now the thing is, this all-pervading power
is everywhere, is everywhere, and that pervading

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:47.069
power does this living job everywhere.

00:06:47.069 --> 00:06:56.240
Not only that it makes a flower into a fruit
but also it decides which flower has to become

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.560
what fruit.

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:07.349
It decides, it co-ordinates, it arranges,
it organises and it loves.

00:07:07.349 --> 00:07:09.639
So this power we have to feel.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:15.340
We never feel it, we see only nothing but
the breeze blowing but we don't see any power

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.638
being existing in this atmosphere.

00:07:17.639 --> 00:07:25.659
The reason is this power is subtler for our
feelings, we cannot feel it, is the frequency

00:07:25.659 --> 00:07:28.599
of this power we cannot feel.

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:34.569
"So how are we to feel this power?" is the
first question should come logically into

00:07:34.569 --> 00:07:36.120
our head.

00:07:36.120 --> 00:07:41.050
There must be something more must happen to
us we have to become subtler personality to

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:43.900
feel that power.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:51.120
Now this becoming is the knowledge of the
roots, is not the knowledge of the tree.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:55.330
Whatever we have achieved through our mental
projections or all discoveries and everything

00:07:55.330 --> 00:08:01.919
we have done about nature, is we have put
them in the books and all that is nothing

00:08:01.919 --> 00:08:03.859
but the knowledge of the tree.

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:12.729
But this tree is sustained by the roots and
these roots are sustaining this great tree

00:08:12.729 --> 00:08:18.340
which is growing, but if this tree doesn't
look after its roots a day will come that

00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:20.008
it is going to be destroyed.

00:08:20.009 --> 00:08:24.939
And that's why people are frightened that
this creation is going to be destroyed now,

00:08:24.939 --> 00:08:28.099
it's just on the verge of destruction.

00:08:28.099 --> 00:08:37.860
Even the human beings who are the epitome
of great evolution have done nothing in totality

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:45.029
if you see the science has advanced more towards
destruction than towards construction.

00:08:45.029 --> 00:08:49.320
It has constructed few things, all right,
but in a whole way supposing you construct

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:55.470
the whole house very beautifully, make everything
beautifully and decorate it nicely and then

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.170
you put a big bomb underneath it.

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:59.920
That's what we have done out of science.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.089
We have created all these nice things and
then we have got this hydrogen bomb, this

00:09:05.089 --> 00:09:09.820
bomb, that bomb, planted on all the sites
that if a button is pressed the whole thing

00:09:09.820 --> 00:09:13.579
can collapse whatever we have created with
such difficulty.

00:09:13.579 --> 00:09:20.199
So look at the stupidity of our endeavour,
our enterprise, the way we have worked it

00:09:20.199 --> 00:09:27.680
out that in totality we are just facing our
own destruction through our own mental projection.

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:33.760
So the other thing that has to happen to us
in our realization is that we find out a method

00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:38.480
by which we understand the constructive side
of life.

00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:46.279
Anything done without the Spirit in it, without
God's grace in it, leads you to destruction.

00:09:46.279 --> 00:09:52.439
Even the elements can get upset with such
a society and can start destroying such societies

00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:59.050
but if the elements do not take over it is
only the same societies which are trying to

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:04.849
elevate a society to higher level themselves
turn back upon themselves and start destroying

00:10:04.850 --> 00:10:07.040
it.

00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.230
Because there are no moorings for us, there
are no roots, because this kite which is flying

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.149
has lost its attachments.

00:10:15.149 --> 00:10:18.250
The attachment has to be to the Spirit.

00:10:18.250 --> 00:10:24.070
Shri Krishna has said that "Yogakshema (spelling
? sounds like -- na me hum u hum) that you

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:28.779
get your 'yoga', means 'union with the Divine'.

00:10:28.779 --> 00:10:34.790
Once you get union with the Divine then I
look after, "I look after yogashema" means,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:38.959
"I look after your well-being", is said by
Shri Krishna.

00:10:38.959 --> 00:10:42.880
But he doesn't say that first I will look
after yogakshema and then you get your yoga

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.310
it's the other way round, you have to take
to your yoga.

00:10:47.310 --> 00:10:51.260
Now the right conclusion about yoga we should
find out what is yoga.

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.209
Now many people think that doing hatha yoga,
which is just a little bit of standing on

00:10:57.209 --> 00:10:59.349
your head business, is yoga.

00:10:59.350 --> 00:11:00.350
It is not.

00:11:00.350 --> 00:11:03.160
It is very commonly said, "I am doing my yoga".

00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.510
I mean you can't 'do' yoga you have to be
'in' yoga.

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:13.899
'Yoga' means 'union with the Divine' and this
happens to you, it just happens to you by

00:11:13.899 --> 00:11:19.370
which you become connected with your Spirit,
what Christ has said is the rebirth, we are

00:11:19.370 --> 00:11:20.880
to be born again.

00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:26.380
But human beings are so much deceptive to
themselves, they deceive themselves so much

00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:30.420
that I have known people that when I went
to America I told them that you have to be

00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.060
born again and all that.

00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:37.138
After that some of them started an organisation
called as Born Again and they just self-certified

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:38.920
themselves that, "We are born again."

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.120
But I mean how can you certify yourself as
born again when you haven't got the qualities,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.220
the capacities and the powers of a twice-born
personality?

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:57.509
Now we have to understand also that if it
is going to be a new birth, a transformation

00:11:57.509 --> 00:11:59.139
must take place within us.

00:11:59.139 --> 00:12:01.620
We must have a transformation.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:07.100
But you'll find that all efforts people have
put it in of conditioning, giving puritanical

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:13.970
ideas and doing all sorts of things it has
not been able to give people transformation.

00:12:13.970 --> 00:12:17.339
It has not led to any transformation.

00:12:17.339 --> 00:12:23.360
On the contrary, their addictions to all kinds
of habits, addiction to all kinds of thoughts

00:12:23.360 --> 00:12:28.430
and also enslavement to all sorts of conditioning
has not at all vanished.

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:33.530
In some way or other if they are communists,
they become capitalists, if they are capitalists

00:12:33.530 --> 00:12:34.530
they become communist.

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:40.540
You see from one to another you are going
into some sort of an ism, ism, ism, ism.

00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:46.890
But in Sahaja Yoga there is nothing like this
because you are only human beings, only human

00:12:46.890 --> 00:12:48.360
beings in the eyes of God.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:54.240
He has created variety he has created one
variety of say, Australians, then in Australia

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:59.220
also he has created so many varieties as you
have so many flowers we have so many human

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:00.220
beings.

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:07.860
But inside every flower flows this vital force
of God's love and that vital force is to be

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:14.670
understood through going into the roots not
from outside through your mental projection.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:17.899
Actually through your mental projection how
far can you go?

00:13:17.899 --> 00:13:25.610
Because it's a limited brain that you are
using to understand a problem but you have

00:13:25.610 --> 00:13:27.610
to go to the unlimited.

00:13:27.610 --> 00:13:34.050
If it is so, something has to trigger it,
your ascent, into that space where it is unlimited

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.949
and that's why we have to know that through
only logical conclusion we can come up to

00:13:38.950 --> 00:13:45.209
the door but afterwards you have to enter
through this door through that triggering

00:13:45.209 --> 00:13:48.500
otherwise you cannot enter into it.

00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:54.270
Now whatever he has told you all about these
chakras you need not believe as Dr Warren

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:55.270
has told you.

00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:59.490
There's no need to believe into it because
even if you have blind faith it's not going

00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:00.769
to help us.

00:14:00.769 --> 00:14:09.079
But as a scientist you must keep your mind
open and you must accept this as a hypothesis

00:14:09.079 --> 00:14:10.420
placed before you.

00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:16.389
Now this hypothesis if it is proved right
you have to accept it as a law, the Divine

00:14:16.389 --> 00:14:17.430
law.

00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:24.269
Now this hypothesis is that you have got all
these seven centers within you and you have

00:14:24.269 --> 00:14:30.360
got the power called as the Kundalini placed
in the triangular bone.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:36.470
Now one may say that this is a Sanskrit word
and Sanskrit is not for only Indians it is

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:37.769
for all of us.

00:14:37.769 --> 00:14:41.520
As English language is for all of us, in the
same way Sanskrit is also for all of us.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:48.110
But only thing I would say, that as the west
was more busy, and you though you are on the

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:53.680
east but still I call it the west, busy with
the advancement outside, there were people

00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:57.709
who were busy with the advancement down.

00:14:57.709 --> 00:15:04.859
And these people are the seers who have seen
that there is a power which is settled down

00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:08.110
in the triangular bone called as sacrum.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.560
Now this is a Greek word.

00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:13.250
It is very interesting to know that sacrum
means sacred.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:17.940
And I asked the Greeks when I went to Greece
I asked them, "Why do you call it sacrum?"

00:15:17.940 --> 00:15:24.210
They said that, "Most of these words have
come to us because we have had a very long

00:15:24.210 --> 00:15:27.620
rapport with the Indo-Aryan groups."

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.700
"So when was that?"

00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:34.769
They said, "It was much before Alexander went
to India."

00:15:34.769 --> 00:15:39.290
So we knew about India long time back and
the Indians told us that this is a sacred

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:40.290
bone.

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:44.660
Even doctors know that when the whole body
burns this bone does not burn.

00:15:44.660 --> 00:15:52.689
It takes lot of temperature, very high temperature
to burn this bone and when you put it in the

00:15:52.689 --> 00:15:58.029
cremation this thing and all that, that has
to brought to a very high temperature so that

00:15:58.029 --> 00:16:05.330
this bone should burn but with other temperatures,
lower temperatures, the whole body may burn

00:16:05.330 --> 00:16:08.660
but this bone will remain still unburned.

00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:12.829
So the reason is there is this power which
is protecting it.

00:16:12.829 --> 00:16:18.750
Now this power is called as Kundalini because
it has got three and a half coils within it.

00:16:18.750 --> 00:16:23.009
You might have read some of you, being seekers,
you must have read books about Kundalini and

00:16:23.009 --> 00:16:27.589
everywhere I go people tell me that, "Mother
we have heard that this is a very dangerous

00:16:27.589 --> 00:16:33.250
thing to have the Kundalini awakened and it's
very, very wrong to touch it."

00:16:33.250 --> 00:16:36.730
Now this is something absurd.

00:16:36.730 --> 00:16:40.339
First of all this is the only way you are
going to get your realisation.

00:16:40.339 --> 00:16:45.560
Is the primule, is the germ within you, the
germinating power within you which is going

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.660
to give you the ascent and how can that be
a thing that will be dangerous for you.

00:16:51.660 --> 00:16:53.120
There must be something wrong.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:56.870
For example, I don't understand about this
instrument or about electricity.

00:16:56.870 --> 00:17:02.009
I'll put my both the fingers in the plug and
I get a shock and I say, "Oh, it's the most

00:17:02.009 --> 00:17:06.349
dangerous thing that you can have," that means
I don't know how to handle it.

00:17:06.349 --> 00:17:11.780
But Kundalini when She is said to be troubling
people it is never the Kundalini but this

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:18.339
first centre of innocence which gets into
annoyance and when it gets into annoyance

00:17:18.339 --> 00:17:25.139
it sends lot of heat in the body and that
heat is felt in the body by so many people.

00:17:25.140 --> 00:17:33.970
When people who have no authority from God
Almighty, we can say, those who are not holy

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:39.040
people, those who are making money in the
name of God, those who are people with very

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:45.320
bad characters who have no possibility of
even taking the name of God such people when

00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:50.899
they try these tricks it happens to you that
you feel that tremendous heat in the body.

00:17:50.900 --> 00:17:55.160
One must know that heat is not a sign of spirituality.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:18:01.340
Everywhere, whether is in Sanskrit or any
language, they have said that it's a cooling,

00:18:01.340 --> 00:18:02.550
it cools you down.

00:18:02.550 --> 00:18:07.250
Even a person you say, "He's cool minded",
means he's not violent.

00:18:07.250 --> 00:18:14.950
Now in science if you try to cool down the
helium gas they, you'll find that when it

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:18.930
is not cooled down, it is heated up, all molecules
fight each other.

00:18:18.930 --> 00:18:22.050
They become so violent that they hit each
other.

00:18:22.050 --> 00:18:27.080
They form certain groups hit each other, and
then these groups also again hit each other.

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:33.510
But when helium gas is cooled down they all
become collective and they start behaving

00:18:33.510 --> 00:18:36.180
in a manner that is very collective.

00:18:36.180 --> 00:18:43.160
So the idea is people who say that with Kundalini
you get tremendous heat, you start jumping,

00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:48.450
and people told me that they start jumping
like a frog.

00:18:48.450 --> 00:18:52.880
One gentleman sitting before me had put both
his legs on the ground he was sitting.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:57.870
So they said, "You can't put these feet towards
Mother".

00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:00.310
So I asked him, I called him, "What's the
problem?"

00:19:00.310 --> 00:19:02.570
You see, Indians understand how to respect
a saint.

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:03.679
So I said, "What's the problem?

00:19:03.680 --> 00:19:05.690
Why are you putting your legs towards me?"

00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:10.430
He said, "Mother, if I sit with folded feet
I start jumping like a frog".

00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.820
So I said, "Are you going to become a frog
now?

00:19:12.820 --> 00:19:13.820
Just think about it!

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.379
You are not going to become a frog or a bird.

00:19:16.380 --> 00:19:19.200
You are going to become a higher personality.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:22.060
Who has told you that you are becoming a frog?"

00:19:22.060 --> 00:19:27.580
He said, "My Kundalini is awakened by a guru
and he has given me this book and in that

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:31.929
book it was written", (actually I saw it with
my own eyes, what a misleading thing!), "that

00:19:31.930 --> 00:19:38.070
he is a person who gets his Kundalini awakened
starts jumping like a frog."

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:46.189
Now all these absurd things must be understood
that all abnormalities are dropped out after

00:19:46.190 --> 00:19:51.670
you become the Spirit because that's the most
beautiful thing you have.

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:58.670
Spirit is the reflection of God Almighty and
when the Kundalini rises and pierces through

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:06.840
your fontanelle bone area where you actually
get your baptism that time you become a beautiful

00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:16.120
person, a decent person, a sweet person, a
nice person and you forget all your violence.

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:21.229
Not only that but you feel the love for others
and not violence.

00:20:21.230 --> 00:20:28.380
Your ego drops out, your superego drops out,
means your conditioning drops out.

00:20:28.380 --> 00:20:34.150
If these transformations don't take place
what's the serve of becoming the Spirit?

00:20:34.150 --> 00:20:37.010
So the ideas people have that you start jumping.

00:20:37.010 --> 00:20:41.080
I know of so many people now who have been
to fake gurus.

00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:45.790
And this point I must bring to you because
everywhere I went the newspaper people ask

00:20:45.790 --> 00:20:47.670
me about the fake gurus.

00:20:47.670 --> 00:20:56.830
The other day a American lady asked me in
an interview of radio at Perth that, "How

00:20:56.830 --> 00:21:02.899
do you explain that the people who are seekers,
the young people, they go to India and they

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:10.020
end up penniless and sometimes they get epilepsy
or they take to drugs?

00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:16.530
Or they become jobless, useless, they live
like cabbages and they have nothing to contribute

00:21:16.530 --> 00:21:19.050
to the society or to themselves.

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:21.290
How do we explain that?"

00:21:21.290 --> 00:21:24.050
She says I've got the datas to show you.

00:21:24.050 --> 00:21:25.800
I said, "I agreed".

00:21:25.800 --> 00:21:33.030
I do feel ashamed that these gurus who are
not only fake but they are criminals they

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.500
go into another country to make money.

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.500
I agree.

00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:37.500
I accept.

00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:42.850
But also I would blame the people who go to
them.

00:21:42.850 --> 00:21:45.520
They are naïve, simple people.

00:21:45.520 --> 00:21:51.120
They are the ones who are earnestly seeking
but you must come to some logical conclusion

00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:52.629
about everything.

00:21:52.630 --> 00:21:57.800
That is important, because you are here to
get to your Spirit and not to get to a guru.

00:21:57.800 --> 00:22:03.620
That's one thing one must know that we have
to be the Spirit and not be attached or be

00:22:03.620 --> 00:22:07.280
sort of enslaved by any guru whatsoever.

00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.899
The guru resides within you in your heart
and your Spirit is your heart.

00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:14.200
Only thing somebody has to trigger it just
to become that.

00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:19.800
But the amount of enslavement and all these
things people undergo for nothing at all.

00:22:19.800 --> 00:22:21.360
You cannot pay for it.

00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:26.600
Anybody who takes money from you is a parasite,
you must know, whether he may be calling himself

00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:27.959
anything, by any name.

00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:29.620
Don't listen to such a person.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:33.270
Now I've been telling all the people for the
last fourteen years.

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:38.010
I was the one fourteen years back, in a very
big hall, at least five, six times bigger

00:22:38.010 --> 00:22:43.850
than this, called as Jehangi Hall in Bombay,
I spoke so loudly about all of them.

00:22:43.850 --> 00:22:47.840
I told their names I told them what they were,
how devilish they are.

00:22:47.840 --> 00:22:48.959
Keep out from them.

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:50.640
But nobody would listen to me.

00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.130
Even when I went to America, in the beginning,
nobody would listen to me.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:55.740
I told them that, "Be careful.

00:22:55.740 --> 00:22:59.110
These fake gurus are out, they are going to
loot you.

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:00.610
Be careful about them.!"

00:23:00.610 --> 00:23:05.350
But nobody would listen to me on this point
because they were so enamoured.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.280
On the contrary, they were teaching me some
wisdom.

00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:11.990
"Mother, you must take some money otherwise
Americans won't understand.

00:23:11.990 --> 00:23:15.300
If, unless and until they pay for it they
are not going to understand".

00:23:15.300 --> 00:23:17.270
I said, "How do you underestimate them?"

00:23:17.270 --> 00:23:18.389
They said, "It's true".

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:23.310
And I tell you I ended up with some disciples
there or some people who got realisation,

00:23:23.310 --> 00:23:25.940
but I was so frustrated.

00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:31.810
I asked one great saint of India to go down
to New York about two years back, and he ran

00:23:31.810 --> 00:23:32.810
away.

00:23:32.810 --> 00:23:33.810
He ran away.

00:23:33.810 --> 00:23:35.909
He said, "I can't manage these Americans.

00:23:35.910 --> 00:23:40.570
Their whole thinking is just the other way
round, about God, about everything".

00:23:40.570 --> 00:23:45.510
Now there were people who were teaching that
you can approach God through sex.

00:23:45.510 --> 00:23:51.050
I mean absurd things, it's obtuse, absolutely
it is opposite of what God is.

00:23:51.050 --> 00:23:56.149
Not that in Sahaja Yoga we disregard sex,
sex is a part of life.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.880
But sex does not play any part in the ascent
you can see because the first centre here

00:24:00.880 --> 00:24:05.990
Mooladhara is for your excretion and for your
sex.

00:24:05.990 --> 00:24:12.380
So we do not in any way condemn it, but it
has its own sanctity and its own channelising.

00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:19.920
If you become sort of perverted about it you
develop diseases, there are problems and anything

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.610
that is divine cannot give you a disease.

00:24:22.610 --> 00:24:27.919
So another conclusion they should have reached,
I think, that if you are sick, your head is

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:33.230
going, reeling, if you are feeling unhappy,
sickly and you don't know what to do then

00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:35.160
why should you stick onto that guru?

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.790
Because just you have paid for it?

00:24:36.790 --> 00:24:40.909
It's like if you go to a drama and it's boring,
you don't like it but you said, "Now we've

00:24:40.910 --> 00:24:42.400
paid for it so go through it".

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:46.630
That's all right because drama doesn't make
you mad, you see, but this kind of thing which

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.870
is so dangerous even if you have paid, finish
with it.

00:24:49.870 --> 00:24:53.489
Now we started that we have had enough of
this man.

00:24:53.490 --> 00:24:55.940
Now they are buying Rolls Royces, they are
buying aeroplanes.

00:24:55.940 --> 00:24:57.990
Look at where is their attention.

00:24:57.990 --> 00:25:02.920
They're more bothered about gathering money
to themselves and having other people's money

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:07.510
as they call them opium and live on that and
thrive on that and why don't you use your

00:25:07.510 --> 00:25:10.510
brains to understand that how can you pay
for your realisation?

00:25:10.510 --> 00:25:15.540
It's one of your mistakes, I think, not to
understand that anyone who is interested in

00:25:15.540 --> 00:25:20.480
your purse is not interested in your Spirit.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:26.030
Then apart from that there are so many other
mistakes people have committed in pursuit

00:25:26.030 --> 00:25:27.200
of God.

00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:34.040
One has to know that when you get your Spirit
you get your own powers.

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:38.780
I may say I'm as these people have said that,
"She's the greatest saint".

00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.860
All right.

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:44.159
If they have said it I say, "All right, because
all the saints in India say so about Me, so

00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:45.730
all right, I agree".

00:25:45.730 --> 00:25:46.960
But I need not say that.

00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:50.640
Even if I say, "I'm the greatest", why should
you believe in it?

00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:52.110
What have you got?

00:25:52.110 --> 00:25:54.580
What powers have you got out of it?

00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:56.860
What have you achieved out of it is the point.

00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:01.419
Is should be absolutely clear cut to you that
unless and until you get your realisation

00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:05.770
you should not (sounds like pujout) and you
should not accept Sahaja Yoga is the ultimate.

00:26:05.770 --> 00:26:10.760
You must try to get your realisation, you
must get the mastery over it.

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:14.860
Unless and until you have done it what's the
use of all Sahaja Yoga done to you.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:18.639
After all it is to transform you into a new
life.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.100
Transform you, what is your own, is all your
own property, I would say.

00:26:24.100 --> 00:26:25.439
Everything is like a trust.

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:28.020
I sometimes say I'm like a banker.

00:26:28.020 --> 00:26:34.040
Now you put your money in the bank and I'm
just a banker who has to give your money.

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:40.510
I'm little a very gracious banker so I may
give double, four times, five times, ten times,

00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:41.990
that's a different point.

00:26:41.990 --> 00:26:49.610
But you are seekers so you are 'men of God'
as described by another very great saint of

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:50.929
England, William Blake.

00:26:50.930 --> 00:26:58.270
He says he has described all these things
to us very clearly that at this time men of

00:26:58.270 --> 00:27:05.990
God will be born and they will become prophets
and they will have powers to make others prophet.

00:27:05.990 --> 00:27:10.100
He has said so clear, everything is so clear-cut,
you can't imagine.

00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:14.980
If you read him you will be amazed that he
has even mentioned where the ashram for Sahaja

00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:19.990
Yoga will be, where I will be staying, into
all details he has mentioned and you must

00:27:19.990 --> 00:27:24.410
have heard the story of Jerusalem that England
will become chaste.

00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:29.670
I mean if you are (inaudible) what they have
been doing about hundred years back in India

00:27:29.670 --> 00:27:36.350
nobody could have believed the stories that
he said, but he could see that the same land

00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:44.469
which is so aggressive today will become the
land of peace, harmony and of spiritualism.

00:27:44.470 --> 00:27:49.380
Australia especially I have tremendous respect
for Australia as a land because it plays a

00:27:49.380 --> 00:27:52.700
very important role in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:52.700 --> 00:27:58.590
This first centre is the Mooladhara, is Australia.

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:03.740
Australia is the Mooladhara of the whole universe
and I find every Australian when I meet them

00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:07.870
there's a kind of an innocence in him which
is still showing now.

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:11.989
Of course, innocence can never be destroyed,
it can be covered but it can never be destroyed.

00:28:11.990 --> 00:28:17.760
I have seen that in Australians there is a
kind of an innocence which shows very sweetly

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:21.120
and that's where it works out very fast.

00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:27.489
Now Dr Warren he first came to me, and his
friend, and in the beginning they were very

00:28:27.490 --> 00:28:30.880
volatile people, extremely angry, hot tempered
and all that, you see.

00:28:30.880 --> 00:28:35.470
And they came to me when I was on my way to
Pune so I said, "All right, you come along

00:28:35.470 --> 00:28:36.690
with me, I haven't got time".

00:28:36.690 --> 00:28:41.690
I think they came to My house and they touched
their realisation but still they were so volatile

00:28:41.690 --> 00:28:42.850
and so angry.

00:28:42.850 --> 00:28:45.179
So I said, "All right, you come along with
Me to Pune".

00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:47.580
And you see in Sahaja Yoga we don't take any
money.

00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:51.149
Naturally, you see, we haven't got very good
arrangements for you.

00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:54.820
If you want you can stay in a hotel, if you
want, but as far as we are concerned whatever

00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:01.200
Sahaja Yogis had arranged in those days, so
we arranged for them to stay in a (what was

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:07.700
that?) a, some place, all right, and there
there was a doctor from England and these

00:29:07.700 --> 00:29:12.170
two persons and there was only one mattress
for three of them, you see.

00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.120
There was troubling, pushing each other.

00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:20.020
In the morning, you see, they got up and they
got into the rickshaw, saying, all their luggage

00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:21.020
there.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.020
I said, "Why?"

00:29:22.020 --> 00:29:23.379
"We slept on the cement", you see.

00:29:23.380 --> 00:29:24.760
I said, "How?"

00:29:24.760 --> 00:29:27.450
"We slept on the cement", thrice+.

00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:28.450
They went on.

00:29:28.450 --> 00:29:29.450
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:29:29.450 --> 00:29:31.020
I said, "How did you sleep on the cement?

00:29:31.020 --> 00:29:32.470
They didn't give you any mattress?"

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:33.470
"No, nothing.

00:29:33.470 --> 00:29:37.720
That fellow from England he was snatching
our mattress all the time and we could not

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.880
sleep and we slept on the cement."

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:45.790
And in that I felt the sweetness of it, how
sweetly they were telling Me their problems.

00:29:45.790 --> 00:29:50.290
It's such a simple problem to sleep on the
cement but sleeping on the cement helps a

00:29:50.290 --> 00:29:54.409
lot, (they did not know at that time), which
helps quite a lot that the Mother Earth sucks

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:55.510
your problems.

00:29:55.510 --> 00:29:58.950
So it was all arranged perhaps that they should
be on the cement.

00:29:58.950 --> 00:30:04.880
But the way they were angry so sweetly and
everybody enjoyed that anger so much in Pune

00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:10.390
and then they got their realisation and I
knew that something good has to happen.

00:30:10.390 --> 00:30:14.080
Once an Australian gets their realisation
it will work out very fast.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:17.879
That's what exactly what happened in their
case and should happen everywhere.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:23.060
I'm very happy on my tour last time in Sydney
we did very well.

00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:29.350
And then we had also this time some program
at Perth for the first time.

00:30:29.350 --> 00:30:35.010
Many people, about three hundred people, got
realisation and it was wonderful and the whole

00:30:35.010 --> 00:30:41.170
thing worked out in such a beautiful way that
I am so much encouraged to be here to be with

00:30:41.170 --> 00:30:45.440
all of you and to do this job, because this
is the job I am here for.

00:30:45.440 --> 00:30:49.190
For this you don't have to do anything.

00:30:49.190 --> 00:30:53.280
First I have to work and then you have to
work for others.

00:30:53.280 --> 00:30:58.691
There are so many who are lost, so many who
are seekers all over the world it's not in

00:30:58.691 --> 00:31:00.710
Australia only, everywhere.

00:31:00.710 --> 00:31:06.140
They have taken to drugs out of seeking, they
have taken to these gurus also out of their

00:31:06.140 --> 00:31:10.010
seeking, all these problems have come to these
seekers.

00:31:10.010 --> 00:31:16.640
Even too, I've seen people who were quite
of my age group they told me they have been

00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:20.800
to some guru in America and who wanted to
cut their tongues.

00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:23.899
All sorts of things they have been trying.

00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.810
You don't have to do anything like that.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:31.419
You have to be quite intact but only thing
that light within you which is the Spirit

00:31:31.420 --> 00:31:33.760
has to shine into your attention.

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.210
Tomorrow I'll tell you what is self realisation.

00:31:36.210 --> 00:31:40.640
Tomorrow I'll tell you exactly what is self
realisation and also I'll tell you about the

00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:41.640
chakras.

00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:45.430
In any case they have given you the books
which are of course just the beginning of

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:51.190
the whole thing is, you can see and read it
and understand what are these chakras and

00:31:51.190 --> 00:31:52.410
what do they do.

00:31:52.410 --> 00:31:58.600
There's nothing to be afraid of, nothing to
be worried, it's your own, it has to happen

00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:03.310
spontaneously, it happens absolutely without
any trouble or torture to you.

00:32:03.310 --> 00:32:10.159
It may happen to all of you, it may happen
to some of you and whatever it is we have

00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:17.910
come here for this purpose only and I'll work
out till my last breath to see that you get

00:32:17.910 --> 00:32:18.930
what you deserve.

00:32:18.930 --> 00:32:20.280
May God bless you.
