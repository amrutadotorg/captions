Hello Anne, how are you?

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:12.416
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

00:00:17.117 --> 00:00:20.162
What a beautiful place we are all in.

00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:26.858
It’s a real blessing of Sahaja Yoga for all of you to relax,

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:34.629
relax well. Because in relaxation only you realize that,

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.112
we are now realized souls.

00:00:38.312 --> 00:00:44.641
That we have entered into the kingdom of heaven.

00:00:44.841 --> 00:00:49.753
That we can see the beauty what God has created around us.

00:00:49.953 --> 00:00:52.558
That we have become sensitive to His grace

00:00:52.758 --> 00:00:56.891
and to His kindness and to His love.

00:01:05.506 --> 00:01:09.680
It’s a seminar that you have arranged and I’m very happy.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.063
I always wanted you to arrange seminars

00:01:12.263 --> 00:01:16.212
and that you all should meet together and live together,

00:01:16.412 --> 00:01:20.249
and understand each other.

00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:24.398
The seminars on the gross level

00:01:24.598 --> 00:01:28.919
they work out many things no doubt.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.740
But on subtler levels, seminars of the Sahaja yogis,

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:38.345
means a lot.

00:01:38.545 --> 00:01:45.438
It means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:49.254
in various places in a country.

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:53.316
And these strongholds

00:01:53.516 --> 00:02:00.500
or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this,

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.338
can form a mechanism by which

00:02:05.538 --> 00:02:13.111
beams of strong vibrations could flow

00:02:13.311 --> 00:02:16.065
or could be thrown all over the places.

00:02:16.265 --> 00:02:25.227
It’s a very great task to build up these mechanisms,

00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:34.204
these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country.

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:39.237
Please, take her out for a while.

00:02:44.877 --> 00:02:49.349
For example, Mother Earth has done Her job.

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:54.779
Wherever it was possible for Her, She has created

00:02:54.979 --> 00:03:01.389
living deities

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:05.643
to show that God exists.

00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:09.455
That you can now test their vibrations and see for yourself

00:03:09.655 --> 00:03:11.769
how She has worked very hard.

00:03:11.969 --> 00:03:18.566
She has created all this beautiful universe.

00:03:19.785 --> 00:03:23.155
She has created you also.

00:03:23.355 --> 00:03:28.214
She has created the kundalini within you.

00:03:29.292 --> 00:03:34.222
She represents the beautiful nature we can say.

00:03:36.018 --> 00:03:41.247
In Her company, in Her bounties when you are drenched

00:03:41.447 --> 00:03:45.603
and you all meet each other,

00:03:45.803 --> 00:03:47.761
you see for yourself

00:03:47.961 --> 00:03:52.414
that how She blesses all of you just the same.

00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:57.266
There is no difference

00:03:57.466 --> 00:04:00.362
between you and any other person for Her.

00:04:00.562 --> 00:04:03.721
But those who are sensitive, are subtler people,

00:04:03.921 --> 00:04:09.117
enjoy Her much more than you people do.

00:04:12.296 --> 00:04:15.283
Now the problem that exists in every country

00:04:15.483 --> 00:04:18.471
has its own style I have seen.

00:04:18.671 --> 00:04:23.862
And as in this country also we have a style of problems

00:04:24.062 --> 00:04:27.914
which comes. Gradually it’s changing its form.

00:04:28.114 --> 00:04:32.899
In the beginning I found that people were overaggressive,

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:40.322
sceptical and also could be rude also sometimes.

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:43.720
It’s all right. Makes no difference to Me.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:47.433
Now gradually they started changing over.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:55.090
Now they are becoming aware of what they have got,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.052
what role they are playing, how important it is to be an Englishman.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:04.019
And when I say English I mean all the English people,

00:05:04.219 --> 00:05:07.006
not Wales or anything different,

00:05:07.207 --> 00:05:13.375
and how they have to become

00:05:13.575 --> 00:05:17.061
part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

00:05:17.261 --> 00:05:19.344
I wondered how many of you really realize

00:05:19.544 --> 00:05:23.473
how important it is to be an Englishman.

00:05:24.348 --> 00:05:29.110
That everything that happens in this country circulates.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.807
For example if this royal wedding had taken place

00:05:32.007 --> 00:05:37.269
in any other royal family it would not have circulated so much.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:39.353
Everything circulates from this country.

00:05:39.553 --> 00:05:41.889
Maybe you may not think much of yourself.

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:44.701
You may think that what is so great

00:05:44.901 --> 00:05:48.168
after all this England is like any other country.

00:05:48.369 --> 00:05:53.913
But you see why people accept so many things from you?

00:05:54.113 --> 00:05:56.133
Like even a monarchy,

00:05:56.333 --> 00:06:01.016
I mean most of the countries have thrown away their monarchies.

00:06:01.216 --> 00:06:06.612
And in this country it exists and it has a respectable position.

00:06:06.812 --> 00:06:11.368
And the symbol of a monarchy

00:06:11.568 --> 00:06:16.880
is still lingering here in a very proud way.

00:06:17.701 --> 00:06:19.752
Then the marriage itself,

00:06:19.952 --> 00:06:22.022
the marriages of royal families are always detested

00:06:22.222 --> 00:06:26.073
and protested and nobody is interested.

00:06:26.274 --> 00:06:29.479
And such a auspicious thing should take place here

00:06:29.679 --> 00:06:33.284
and that everybody should see it.

00:06:33.484 --> 00:06:37.135
So many countries should watch it and appreciate it

00:06:37.335 --> 00:06:40.667
and enjoy it of all the things.

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:44.492
It’s something surprising.

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:49.026
It transcends all rationality,

00:06:49.226 --> 00:06:53.465
all understanding of even logic

00:06:53.666 --> 00:06:55.511
we can say that what is the logic behind it?

00:06:55.711 --> 00:06:57.530
But if you are enjoying it you just enjoy.

00:06:57.730 --> 00:07:02.574
You don’t want to think about it why you are enjoying.

00:07:03.505 --> 00:07:06.870
So, one has to understand that you are part and parcel

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:12.180
of the heart of the universe.

00:07:13.729 --> 00:07:17.390
One thing is essential

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:22.743
that you have to be very flexible people.

00:07:22.943 --> 00:07:26.871
You have to have

00:07:27.072 --> 00:07:33.033
the flexibility of the heart cells we can say.

00:07:35.472 --> 00:07:40.440
Now heart has to pump.

00:07:40.640 --> 00:07:46.265
It has to be strong.

00:07:47.278 --> 00:07:50.488
And surprisingly lion is your emblem.

00:07:50.688 --> 00:07:54.441
So you have to have a lion’s heart.

00:07:54.641 --> 00:07:56.743
And lion’s heart means he is not afraid.

00:07:56.943 --> 00:08:01.662
He is the king. He knows he’s the king and he lives like a king.

00:08:03.802 --> 00:08:08.876
Like a lion and Leo as in astrology

00:08:09.076 --> 00:08:14.392
or if you say is a man who is extremely generous,

00:08:14.592 --> 00:08:16.807
lion hearted, not afraid of anyone.

00:08:17.007 --> 00:08:21.187
There should be no fear.

00:08:23.047 --> 00:08:25.082
But English language if you read anyone

00:08:25.282 --> 00:08:27.144
or if you listen to anyone,

00:08:27.344 --> 00:08:30.169
every third sentence he’ll come with the word,

00:08:30.369 --> 00:08:32.802
“I’m afraid.

00:08:33.002 --> 00:08:36.177
I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”…

00:08:36.377 --> 00:08:40.911
This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis.

00:08:41.111 --> 00:08:44.798
What is there to be afraid of?

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.512
Some people say that this is said because we do not want

00:08:47.712 --> 00:08:51.071
to hurt other people. There are so many other ways

00:08:51.272 --> 00:08:53.332
of saying things without hurting others.

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:56.894
But what is there to be afraid of?

00:08:57.094 --> 00:09:01.183
A man who is weak cannot love.

00:09:01.383 --> 00:09:05.832
Only a strong person can love.

00:09:06.032 --> 00:09:08.043
If you talk of love first of all see

00:09:08.243 --> 00:09:11.045
whether you are strong enough to love or not.

00:09:11.245 --> 00:09:14.115
Loving is not a easy thing, even carnal love,

00:09:14.315 --> 00:09:17.635
even loving your beloved of in the ordinary sense.

00:09:17.835 --> 00:09:20.252
It’s not a easy thing.

00:09:20.452 --> 00:09:25.299
You have to have a very strong moral concept,

00:09:25.499 --> 00:09:30.604
otherwise every third minute people start changing their loves.

00:09:30.973 --> 00:09:33.353
That kind of a love has no meaning.

00:09:33.553 --> 00:09:42.483
You have to have a very firm ideas.

00:09:42.683 --> 00:09:47.183
Not only ideas in your brain but built within you.

00:09:49.891 --> 00:09:54.045
Very few people can really have a love as Romeo had,

00:09:54.245 --> 00:09:56.232
I can tell you this.

00:09:56.432 --> 00:09:59.643
It’s easy to think that you are a Romeo, it’s different.

00:09:59.843 --> 00:10:02.854
You can think you are you are the King of England,

00:10:03.054 --> 00:10:06.651
it’s all right. But you don’t become that way.

00:10:06.851 --> 00:10:10.690
So to be Romeo itself

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.026
you have to have a tremendous character.

00:10:15.226 --> 00:10:22.048
A tremendous sense of sacrifice and love

00:10:22.248 --> 00:10:26.634
and understanding of what you want.

00:10:26.834 --> 00:10:33.343
You want to love, that’s all nothing beyond or before.

00:10:35.948 --> 00:10:37.869
I mean a man when he falls in love

00:10:38.070 --> 00:10:40.326
he falls in love forever and ever and ever.

00:10:40.526 --> 00:10:45.736
If he falls in love many a times it cannot be love.

00:10:45.936 --> 00:10:48.009
So that experience also

00:10:48.209 --> 00:10:54.732
is sort of is a forbidden fruit for most of them.

00:10:59.847 --> 00:11:07.686
So to love God is even more difficult,

00:11:07.886 --> 00:11:11.415
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

00:11:11.615 --> 00:11:16.118
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

00:11:16.318 --> 00:11:20.143
It is very difficult.

00:11:20.343 --> 00:11:24.820
But today that is not the case.

00:11:27.914 --> 00:11:32.983
But still you have to have

00:11:33.183 --> 00:11:37.092
no fear in your mind, trust,

00:11:37.292 --> 00:11:40.947
you trust yourself and trust others.

00:11:41.147 --> 00:11:45.358
First of all try to trust yourself.

00:11:46.610 --> 00:11:48.754
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

00:11:48.954 --> 00:11:53.339
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right so what?”

00:11:53.539 --> 00:11:56.698
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

00:11:56.898 --> 00:12:01.406
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

00:12:01.606 --> 00:12:05.203
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

00:12:05.403 --> 00:12:10.762
I can improve. I can do better.”

00:12:10.962 --> 00:12:17.340
Some people think that if you trust yourself

00:12:17.540 --> 00:12:20.504
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

00:12:20.704 --> 00:12:24.842
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

00:12:25.042 --> 00:12:32.046
This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that,

00:12:32.246 --> 00:12:36.564
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

00:12:36.764 --> 00:12:39.736
I have been faltering but I can correct.

00:12:39.936 --> 00:12:41.759
I have that strength within me.

00:12:41.959 --> 00:12:43.728
I can rise above all these things.

00:12:43.928 --> 00:12:51.477
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

00:12:55.861 --> 00:12:59.514
Trust yourself. Trust that you are realized souls.

00:12:59.714 --> 00:13:01.714
Trust that God loves you.

00:13:01.915 --> 00:13:06.759
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

00:13:06.959 --> 00:13:10.709
Love yourself.

00:13:13.178 --> 00:13:16.125
You are unique no doubt.

00:13:16.325 --> 00:13:20.719
As it is human beings, every individual is an unique person.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:25.010
But after realization

00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:29.468
you are definitely unique person.

00:13:33.122 --> 00:13:37.380
It never means ego trip. One has to use

00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.255
discretion about understanding. It never means ego trip.

00:13:42.455 --> 00:13:47.931
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

00:13:52.597 --> 00:13:56.683
Yes you are not perfect.

00:13:58.714 --> 00:14:03.168
You are unique but you are not perfect. You have to perfect yourself.

00:14:03.832 --> 00:14:08.517
These words can be very confusing. When I say you are unique

00:14:08.717 --> 00:14:10.428
immediately, you think you are perfect.

00:14:10.628 --> 00:14:14.784
These are two words, unique and perfect.

00:14:15.084 --> 00:14:17.931
Somebody can be unique

00:14:18.131 --> 00:14:21.042
but he can have imperfections.

00:14:21.242 --> 00:14:23.901
So you have to perfect yourself.

00:14:24.101 --> 00:14:26.878
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

00:14:27.078 --> 00:14:30.648
through your kundalini awakening, clearing your charkas.

00:14:30.848 --> 00:14:36.028
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

00:14:37.061 --> 00:14:43.009
You have to perfect. I have so many ways I tell you;

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:47.468
directly, sometimes indirectly, through friends,

00:14:47.668 --> 00:14:52.972
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

00:14:54.732 --> 00:14:57.258
You should think that I am within you.

00:14:57.458 --> 00:15:02.290
I am that part within you which is discretion.

00:15:02.490 --> 00:15:05.219
When you do not understand your own discretion,

00:15:05.419 --> 00:15:12.339
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

00:15:12.539 --> 00:15:17.549
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

00:15:17.749 --> 00:15:19.971
or, some of them accept it.

00:15:20.171 --> 00:15:24.105
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

00:15:24.305 --> 00:15:26.824
you are definitely unique,

00:15:27.024 --> 00:15:31.026
one specially blessed.

00:15:31.226 --> 00:15:33.567
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

00:15:33.767 --> 00:15:38.181
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

00:15:39.064 --> 00:15:46.207
So you have to discriminate between ego

00:15:46.407 --> 00:15:51.264
or ego trips as they call it

00:15:51.464 --> 00:15:55.230
and ascent.

00:15:55.958 --> 00:16:02.981
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

00:16:03.590 --> 00:16:07.679
It would be something like throwing you in the air

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:09.938
and again you come back with a bump and break

00:16:10.138 --> 00:16:13.219
one of your necks or something like that.

00:16:13.419 --> 00:16:15.042
That’s what ego trip is.

00:16:15.242 --> 00:16:20.384
But ascent is where you really rise above.

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:23.306
Not only that you rise

00:16:23.506 --> 00:16:27.137
but with you,

00:16:27.337 --> 00:16:29.379
you make others rise.

00:16:29.579 --> 00:16:35.704
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

00:16:36.883 --> 00:16:39.558
The higher you ascend the better it is.

00:16:39.758 --> 00:16:42.795
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

00:16:42.995 --> 00:16:46.629
never so.

00:16:49.544 --> 00:16:54.286
There’s a story of a teacher and a student.

00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.028
The teacher was very kind to the student

00:17:00.228 --> 00:17:03.701
and he would come and show him his creations.

00:17:03.901 --> 00:17:07.424
He was very kind to him.

00:17:08.490 --> 00:17:10.391
And every time he would say that,

00:17:10.591 --> 00:17:12.352
“I have done this good

00:17:12.552 --> 00:17:15.015
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

00:17:15.215 --> 00:17:18.550
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

00:17:18.850 --> 00:17:21.502
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

00:17:21.702 --> 00:17:25.709
you better correct this part, then do this.”

00:17:27.187 --> 00:17:32.790
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

00:17:32.990 --> 00:17:38.205
He said, “You are no more student now.”

00:17:41.111 --> 00:17:45.546
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

00:17:45.746 --> 00:17:52.814
There was another

00:17:53.014 --> 00:17:58.669
student who was coming every day and correcting himself.

00:18:01.256 --> 00:18:04.295
And he told to his teacher that,

00:18:04.495 --> 00:18:08.487
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

00:18:08.687 --> 00:18:12.585
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

00:18:15.202 --> 00:18:19.084
The third one was a student who came

00:18:19.284 --> 00:18:25.572
and he was always trying to see what was the mistake

00:18:25.772 --> 00:18:28.822
and how he has to correct and how he worked very hard,

00:18:29.022 --> 00:18:32.991
very assiduous, very hard working.

00:18:34.467 --> 00:18:42.379
And he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

00:18:42.579 --> 00:18:45.184
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

00:18:45.384 --> 00:18:49.860
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

00:18:55.898 --> 00:18:59.401
That is what one has to understand.

00:18:59.601 --> 00:19:01.956
You ascend.

00:19:02.156 --> 00:19:04.526
You will become humbler.

00:19:04.726 --> 00:19:06.721
It is just the other way around people understand.

00:19:06.921 --> 00:19:10.605
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved some special powers.

00:19:10.805 --> 00:19:14.714
I don’t know. Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

00:19:14.914 --> 00:19:17.151
I am very good in spirituality.

00:19:17.351 --> 00:19:20.822
I am very high up and all that, this self-certificate starts.

00:19:21.023 --> 00:19:24.856
And then it can reach such a point

00:19:25.056 --> 00:19:29.923
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

00:19:31.565 --> 00:19:35.342
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

00:19:35.542 --> 00:19:37.875
Actually the people who ascend

00:19:38.075 --> 00:19:43.856
there are certain qualities that show on them.

00:19:44.699 --> 00:19:48.296
The first thing is your collectivity.

00:19:48.496 --> 00:19:52.418
How collective you are.

00:19:53.342 --> 00:19:55.908
With how many people you can carry on.

00:19:56.108 --> 00:20:00.006
At how many things you can laugh.

00:20:01.092 --> 00:20:05.187
That is one of the biggest qualities.

00:20:05.751 --> 00:20:08.066
The second quality is that

00:20:08.266 --> 00:20:12.537
how much you accept another’s domination

00:20:12.737 --> 00:20:16.450
who, cuts down your collectivity.

00:20:16.651 --> 00:20:20.382
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

00:20:20.582 --> 00:20:26.274
If you allow others to cut your personality,

00:20:26.474 --> 00:20:31.689
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

00:20:31.889 --> 00:20:34.382
you are the employee.

00:20:34.582 --> 00:20:38.469
And the boss is not realized soul and you are an realized soul.

00:20:38.669 --> 00:20:42.403
Or maybe both are realized souls. Take it like that.

00:20:42.603 --> 00:20:50.229
And one of them is ascending.

00:20:50.429 --> 00:20:53.018
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

00:20:53.218 --> 00:20:58.015
there are congenial relationship, but to a point.

00:20:58.579 --> 00:21:00.931
He will never compromise with his boss

00:21:01.131 --> 00:21:03.790
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

00:21:03.990 --> 00:21:07.609
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

00:21:07.809 --> 00:21:16.518
On that point he’ll never have any domination because

00:21:16.718 --> 00:21:19.908
how much you feel responsible about yourself

00:21:20.108 --> 00:21:24.642
is the second point.

00:21:24.842 --> 00:21:29.167
How much you are responsible to be there,

00:21:29.367 --> 00:21:31.817
to be a cell in the heart.

00:21:32.017 --> 00:21:36.713
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

00:21:39.968 --> 00:21:46.371
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

00:21:46.571 --> 00:21:53.826
and extremely obedient to the Self, to the Spirit.

00:21:56.271 --> 00:21:59.845
It has to activate, work harder when there is need,

00:22:00.045 --> 00:22:03.744
there emergency.

00:22:03.944 --> 00:22:08.803
That it enjoys the most.

00:22:11.162 --> 00:22:18.603
And no impurity should be allowed, the third point now.

00:22:18.803 --> 00:22:26.688
As I told you first is collectivity, secondly your responsibility

00:22:26.888 --> 00:22:29.393
and third point is purity.

00:22:29.593 --> 00:22:33.833
Purity of your own heart first of all,

00:22:34.033 --> 00:22:39.857
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

00:22:40.057 --> 00:22:45.285
As I am saying this you will be realizing that all Englishmen

00:22:45.485 --> 00:22:50.754
believe in the contrary,

00:22:50.954 --> 00:22:55.872
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

00:22:56.072 --> 00:23:00.590
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

00:23:00.790 --> 00:23:03.403
Trust others.

00:23:03.603 --> 00:23:08.840
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.321
Trust others.

00:23:14.401 --> 00:23:16.623
Why do you doubt? If you do not doubt yourself,

00:23:16.823 --> 00:23:19.586
you’ll not doubt others.

00:23:19.987 --> 00:23:22.101
What are they going to take away from you?

00:23:22.301 --> 00:23:25.621
What have you got?

00:23:25.965 --> 00:23:29.118
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

00:23:29.318 --> 00:23:35.410
It’s all quite intact. It’s all nicely glued down.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.098
So nothing is going to disappear.

00:23:40.298 --> 00:23:49.519
What are they going to hurt to a person who is a realized soul?

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:52.774
If your heart is clean,

00:23:52.974 --> 00:23:56.780
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

00:23:56.980 --> 00:24:00.875
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

00:24:01.075 --> 00:24:04.190
such a powerful thing that even a glance

00:24:04.390 --> 00:24:09.608
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:16.229
Purity of heart, actually when the heart becomes impure

00:24:16.429 --> 00:24:20.856
the impurity flows down to other places.

00:24:23.942 --> 00:24:26.392
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

00:24:26.592 --> 00:24:29.869
Many people believe that it’s the body

00:24:30.069 --> 00:24:32.995
that becomes impure. I think it is the heart,

00:24:33.195 --> 00:24:35.441
which becomes really impure,

00:24:35.641 --> 00:24:37.683
and then it starts trickling down to the body

00:24:37.883 --> 00:24:42.571
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

00:24:46.332 --> 00:24:52.011
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart. Open heart.

00:24:53.386 --> 00:24:57.279
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

00:24:57.479 --> 00:25:01.386
What is there not to trust anyone?

00:25:02.839 --> 00:25:07.300
What is there to be angry with anyone?

00:25:08.987 --> 00:25:13.022
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

00:25:13.222 --> 00:25:17.480
be nice to everyone. On the way you find somebody’s difficulty,

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:21.849
give him a hand. If somebody cannot sit properly e.

00:25:22.049 --> 00:25:25.872
or has a problem you try to remove the problem.

00:25:26.072 --> 00:25:30.541
If the person cannot stand, give the place.

00:25:33.048 --> 00:25:35.345
Try to give from your clean heart.

00:25:35.545 --> 00:25:40.100
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

00:25:43.629 --> 00:25:47.938
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

00:25:48.138 --> 00:25:50.344
which Felicity wanted me to discuss,

00:25:50.544 --> 00:25:52.064
is how to clean the heart.

00:25:52.264 --> 00:25:57.439
There is no broom available for that in the supermarket.

00:26:00.886 --> 00:26:05.792
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

00:26:14.358 --> 00:26:18.510
But there is a way.

00:26:18.710 --> 00:26:22.276
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

00:26:22.476 --> 00:26:26.281
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:29.770
I trust you.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:32.714
People laugh at Me sometimes. Some of these saints

00:26:32.914 --> 00:26:34.926
who are supposed to be very great people,

00:26:35.126 --> 00:26:36.973
they can’t understand how I trust you.

00:26:37.173 --> 00:26:41.030
They’d say that oh these are all lost races?

00:26:41.230 --> 00:26:45.546
These are horrible people how do you trust them.

00:26:45.746 --> 00:26:49.212
They are not sanyasis, they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

00:26:49.412 --> 00:26:52.276
They are ordinary people.

00:26:52.476 --> 00:26:56.026
For them I mean your value is nothing.

00:26:56.226 --> 00:26:58.035
They’ll if you go to them

00:26:58.235 --> 00:27:02.352
they will make you stand on your head for three months.

00:27:02.552 --> 00:27:05.299
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

00:27:05.499 --> 00:27:08.940
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

00:27:09.140 --> 00:27:11.972
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

00:27:12.172 --> 00:27:15.222
The day you came to me I trusted you.

00:27:15.422 --> 00:27:18.776
And I worked on you from the very first day,

00:27:18.976 --> 00:27:23.712
knowing what you are but I trust your Spirit

00:27:23.912 --> 00:27:27.948
that it would shine, in the same way, trust.

00:27:28.148 --> 00:27:32.776
We laugh at others. I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

00:27:32.976 --> 00:27:37.656
make fun of them when they come to Me.

00:27:38.470 --> 00:27:39.840
Trust them.

00:27:40.040 --> 00:27:44.376
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

00:27:46.313 --> 00:27:50.597
So you have to believe

00:27:50.797 --> 00:27:58.850
in yourself and enjoy the way

00:27:59.050 --> 00:28:03.504
gently you are sweeping

00:28:03.704 --> 00:28:06.795
into the current of your Mother’s love.

00:28:06.995 --> 00:28:10.736
Just enjoy that.

00:28:12.455 --> 00:28:17.231
Like a flower that falls into the current

00:28:17.431 --> 00:28:23.796
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

00:28:23.996 --> 00:28:27.640
In the same way,

00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:31.226
you should enjoy.

00:28:33.773 --> 00:28:39.492
When that enjoyment comes into you, you will start trusting.

00:28:40.398 --> 00:28:44.296
And trust your Mother.

00:28:46.524 --> 00:28:50.192
I try many things to correct you.

00:28:50.392 --> 00:28:54.177
But trust in one thing, that whatever I try for you

00:28:54.377 --> 00:28:58.116
or do anything,

00:28:58.316 --> 00:29:03.992
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

00:29:04.192 --> 00:29:07.692
That’s My job.

00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:14.039
May sometimes you might feel I am publicly saying things for you.

00:29:14.239 --> 00:29:16.642
May be your images are being ruined by that

00:29:16.842 --> 00:29:21.992
or whatever you may think. That’s not the way,

00:29:24.303 --> 00:29:30.608
is for your hitha, is for the well-being of your Spirit.

00:29:34.791 --> 00:29:39.885
And that is the most difficult job.

00:29:43.869 --> 00:29:47.725
With all this,

00:29:47.925 --> 00:29:51.489
trust in your heart.

00:29:52.989 --> 00:29:55.937
First trust yourself,

00:29:56.137 --> 00:29:58.422
trust others,

00:29:58.622 --> 00:30:01.215
other Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:01.415 --> 00:30:03.965
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Who is your neighbour?

00:30:04.165 --> 00:30:07.097
He is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:30:07.297 --> 00:30:10.297
Stand by him.

00:30:15.809 --> 00:30:18.220
And trust your Mother.

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:23.493
As I have trusted you, you have to trust Me,

00:30:25.798 --> 00:30:28.798
and it will work out.

00:30:30.118 --> 00:30:34.778
Open your heart to this trust.

00:30:39.780 --> 00:30:43.299
You should not worry whether it would be

00:30:43.499 --> 00:30:45.832
protocolish all right or not,

00:30:46.032 --> 00:30:52.107
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

00:30:52.307 --> 00:30:55.380
because heart knows. Whatever your heart will do

00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.096
in its genuine form will be respectable,

00:30:59.296 --> 00:31:04.494
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

00:31:04.694 --> 00:31:08.744
That will look after you. By outer forms,

00:31:08.944 --> 00:31:13.339
whatever you try is not going to work out.

00:31:13.539 --> 00:31:18.317
It is that trust in your loving heart

00:31:18.517 --> 00:31:20.754
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

00:31:20.954 --> 00:31:23.733
You see today she brought some flowers.

00:31:23.933 --> 00:31:27.336
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

00:31:27.536 --> 00:31:29.793
She went to the station

00:31:29.993 --> 00:31:33.183
and there she was taking some flowers out.

00:31:33.383 --> 00:31:36.715
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

00:31:36.915 --> 00:31:39.742
and they said, “Oh go ahead. They are only weeds you can have them.”

00:31:39.942 --> 00:31:41.500
And they are so fragrant.

00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:44.773
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

00:31:44.973 --> 00:31:46.884
They are just weeds.

00:31:47.084 --> 00:31:50.105
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

00:31:50.305 --> 00:31:55.977
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

00:31:57.352 --> 00:32:01.920
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

00:32:02.120 --> 00:32:06.057
and all the breeding that is required.

00:32:06.862 --> 00:32:12.835
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

00:32:14.592 --> 00:32:17.772
is most enjoyable.

00:32:18.305 --> 00:32:23.241
Today I wanted to tell you something good about Greece

00:32:23.441 --> 00:32:26.510
before we start off with the Puja for about ten minutes.

00:32:26.710 --> 00:32:28.531
Very interesting things have happened.

00:32:28.731 --> 00:32:35.647
When I went to Greece, I knew that I had to go to Greece.

00:32:35.897 --> 00:32:40.733
And they told me that they believed in the beginning in one Mother,

00:32:40.933 --> 00:32:43.750
in one Primordial Mother.

00:32:43.950 --> 00:32:48.054
But after sometime there were some Indo-Aryan people,

00:32:48.254 --> 00:32:50.281
Indo-Aryan who came down to them.

00:32:50.481 --> 00:32:52.499
And they said, “Yes there is one Mother

00:32:52.699 --> 00:32:54.548
but She has many aspects

00:32:54.748 --> 00:32:58.728
and these aspects are expressed as different Gods.”

00:32:58.928 --> 00:33:02.339
And then they told about all the Gods, which you know of.

00:33:02.539 --> 00:33:05.519
But they, they later on

00:33:05.719 --> 00:33:10.456
made them absolutely human type of Gods and they spoilt it.

00:33:10.656 --> 00:33:13.574
But still there are certain things so amazing it was.

00:33:13.774 --> 00:33:17.971
Like Athena is the name of the Goddess, the Primordial Mother.

00:33:18.171 --> 00:33:23.465
But Athena Atha, Atha in Sanskrit means the primordial.

00:33:26.879 --> 00:33:30.432
And they got the word from Athena. And to the water they call

00:33:30.632 --> 00:33:34.192
Neeru, Nero. And in Sanskrit it is Nira.

00:33:34.392 --> 00:33:38.038
My name is at home is I am called as Nira,

00:33:38.238 --> 00:33:41.387
means from water.

00:33:46.236 --> 00:33:49.302
It’s very surprising how many words there are,

00:33:49.502 --> 00:33:52.746
like I said – told them about the centers. They said, “Kendro,”

00:33:52.946 --> 00:33:56.115
in Sanskrit it is Kendra.

00:33:56.315 --> 00:34:01.180
But the best was in Delphi when I went,

00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:05.680
we were surprised at something they said,

00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:11.449
“That it is the navel of the universe”.

00:34:12.535 --> 00:34:18.625
I said, “Europe is the liver and Greece is the navel.”

00:34:18.825 --> 00:34:22.669
They showed a point that is the navel it was vibrating.

00:34:22.869 --> 00:34:26.507
And not only that but they showed the most remarkable thing

00:34:26.707 --> 00:34:30.163
was that this is the mound,

00:34:30.363 --> 00:34:36.803
which is actually the expression of the navel is the mound

00:34:37.003 --> 00:34:39.349
which is actually has come out the Mother Earth

00:34:39.549 --> 00:34:41.489
is the one this one.

00:34:41.689 --> 00:34:44.405
And this is actually Athena according to them.

00:34:44.605 --> 00:34:48.266
This is that has come out of the Mother Earth.

00:34:48.466 --> 00:34:51.298
I saw the vibrations were tremendous.

00:34:51.498 --> 00:34:54.462
And next to that there were lot of vibrations coming

00:34:54.662 --> 00:34:57.980
so I turned round and what I find? Is a Ganesha,

00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:05.092
absolute Ganesha there sitting down with a beautiful trunk,

00:35:05.292 --> 00:35:10.103
the face and the ears and the eyes, and the stomach!

00:35:10.303 --> 00:35:12.104
Can you believe it?

00:35:12.304 --> 00:35:16.268
Sitting next to Her and absolutely the vibrations coming.

00:35:16.468 --> 00:35:19.778
I mean I didn’t have a photograph I mean camera or anything

00:35:19.978 --> 00:35:21.559
otherwise I would have taken a photograph

00:35:21.759 --> 00:35:23.858
but now if you go and you can see.

00:35:24.058 --> 00:35:27.787
Another thing is they showed the egg, just imagine,

00:35:27.987 --> 00:35:32.599
and the eternal egg from where the other eggs come out you see!

00:35:32.799 --> 00:35:36.037
And the eggs are shown divided the same way into spindles

00:35:36.237 --> 00:35:40.176
as they do which doctors know they have seen under microscope.

00:35:40.376 --> 00:35:44.754
But how did they see, those Greeks? God only knows.

00:35:44.954 --> 00:35:47.940
But there’s another side to it.

00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.538
First they use to get Amruta. t.

00:35:51.738 --> 00:35:55.819
Is the one that was meant for the Gods

00:35:56.019 --> 00:35:59.007
by which they were given eternal life

00:35:59.207 --> 00:36:03.952
in the sense they were appointed as permanent features you see.

00:36:04.152 --> 00:36:08.176
But then the same thing they wanted everybody to have

00:36:08.376 --> 00:36:11.723
so they started using some that was called as ambrosia.

00:36:11.923 --> 00:36:14.059
They converted into something else

00:36:14.259 --> 00:36:16.478
and they started calling it Ambrosia

00:36:16.678 --> 00:36:19.814
and some sort of a LSD business.

00:36:20.014 --> 00:36:22.425
So also, they went into trance

00:36:22.625 --> 00:36:26.667
so the rest of it is all supra-conscious.

00:36:26.867 --> 00:36:30.031
And that supra-conscious also side by side exists.

00:36:30.231 --> 00:36:33.234
Now discretion has to be used

00:36:33.434 --> 00:36:37.431
how around reality always supra-conscious

00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:42.880
or collective subconscious works out, one way or the other.

00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.106
And you have to go to the point where the reality exists.

00:36:46.306 --> 00:36:49.606
But what happens you get lost into the supra-conscious

00:36:49.806 --> 00:36:53.633
or you get lost into the superego or we can say the,

00:36:53.833 --> 00:36:56.977
the collective subconscious area.

00:36:57.177 --> 00:36:59.341
So you see both things are to be found out,

00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:01.571
Like an Indian temple, you go,

00:37:01.771 --> 00:37:04.773
you’ll find all surrounded by collective subconscious.

00:37:04.973 --> 00:37:07.244
Too much ritualism, ritualistic,

00:37:07.444 --> 00:37:09.681
ritualism takes them to the left side.

00:37:09.881 --> 00:37:17.895
With that they go to the problem of getting all these women

00:37:18.095 --> 00:37:22.387
who get spirits, they go on, “hoohoohoo” before the deities,

00:37:22.587 --> 00:37:28.025
and then they tell the name of the horse and all those things.

00:37:28.236 --> 00:37:32.294
In Mahalakshmi’ s temple, which is a real temple,

00:37:32.294 --> 00:37:35.059
where all the three deities have come out in Bombay

00:37:35.059 --> 00:37:38.192
where I used to live very close to that place,

00:37:38.392 --> 00:37:42.880
just imagine, and this is very common.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:47.724
So to understand how human beings reacted to that

00:37:47.825 --> 00:37:50.452
is very well shown in Delphi.

00:37:50.652 --> 00:37:53.621
It’s a beautiful thing is so done.

00:37:53.721 --> 00:37:57.077
But I was amazed at the Temple of Athena when we went there.

00:37:57.077 --> 00:38:00.405
It’s so much so near to the thing that

00:38:00.405 --> 00:38:05.061
the Mooladhara is shown there where the Kundalini exists.

00:38:05.161 --> 00:38:08.444
Now She is the one who has snakes around Her, see?

00:38:08.444 --> 00:38:11.764
And She has little, little snakes as Her children. Can you imagine?

00:38:11.903 --> 00:38:15.200
And She is one, and She has a daughter,

00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:21.595
which is the Kundalini in you and a God who is a child God.

00:38:22.093 --> 00:38:25.103
And when She stands She has a Kundalini in her hand,

00:38:25.103 --> 00:38:28.878
the snake coming out of Her hand. With all the charkas, she is made.

00:38:29.078 --> 00:38:31.291
It’s so beautifully shown.

00:38:31.291 --> 00:38:34.516
The best was Her Sanctum Sanctorum

00:38:34.516 --> 00:38:37.608
where nobody is allowed to go inside where She resides,

00:38:37.708 --> 00:38:40.005
is the Adi Kundalini.

00:38:40.037 --> 00:38:48.275
But they say that She came out of the head of Zeus,

00:38:49.144 --> 00:38:53.636
the Primordial Kundalini. And Her place nobody can go inside,

00:38:53.636 --> 00:38:57.895
nobody can reach except for Her son, the child son.

00:38:58.096 --> 00:39:01.239
But Her,

00:39:01.239 --> 00:39:04.676
Her steps are very large

00:39:04.676 --> 00:39:08.604
also are roundish. She curved. Can you imagine?

00:39:08.604 --> 00:39:12.638
They’re curved as if part of the Kundalas they are.

00:39:12.638 --> 00:39:20.328
And they are 3 ½ in height,

00:39:20.328 --> 00:39:24.364
you can see that, in height and in width also.

00:39:24.364 --> 00:39:27.253
Like every place is made of big,

00:39:27.454 --> 00:39:30.587
I mean the three are made of big stones and the last one

00:39:30.587 --> 00:39:34.950
is made of the small, three and a half, and they go in a curve.

00:39:34.950 --> 00:39:40.315
And that is Sanctum Sanctorum nobody can go inside.

00:39:41.793 --> 00:39:45.753
Now what an expression it was. This was the early Expression

00:39:45.753 --> 00:39:49.348
and Athens is after Her name Athena.

00:39:49.348 --> 00:39:53.477
If you see the face also you will find your Mother very much there.

00:39:53.477 --> 00:39:56.294
I’ve got the photographs and all that which I will show you later on.

00:39:56.294 --> 00:39:59.509
But what I’m saying the Mother Earth has done Her job.

00:39:59.509 --> 00:40:06.310
People have done their job. Christ or we can say Mohammed

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:11.969
or Buddha, Kabira, anyone of them;

00:40:11.969 --> 00:40:15.981
they have done their jobs, alright. They have worked for you.

00:40:15.981 --> 00:40:19.505
They have created places within you. They have done their job.

00:40:19.505 --> 00:40:25.222
Now it is you who are on the stage, not Me.

00:40:26.642 --> 00:40:31.531
Sahastrara has to work it out.

00:40:31.531 --> 00:40:36.690
And Sahastrara always surrounds the heart.

00:40:37.293 --> 00:40:43.428
You are enlightened by your Spirit, which resides in your heart.

00:40:43.629 --> 00:40:50.795
And the whole Sahastrara’s mandalas are around the heart.

00:40:54.260 --> 00:41:02.633
So as you are now the temple of that Spirit,

00:41:02.633 --> 00:41:05.351
you are the heart.

00:41:05.351 --> 00:41:09.216
You have to be very, very assiduous.

00:41:09.216 --> 00:41:15.304
This is the fourth point, which is again against all Englishmen.

00:41:16.446 --> 00:41:19.589
They are holidaying permanently.

00:41:19.589 --> 00:41:22.835
The whole attention is in holidays.

00:41:22.835 --> 00:41:27.668
At the slightest pretext, they are on a holiday.

00:41:28.359 --> 00:41:33.708
The word holiday comes from the word holy day,

00:41:35.581 --> 00:41:38.993
is to do something holy on that day.

00:41:38.993 --> 00:41:45.790
God took his leave from the whole world for one day

00:41:45.790 --> 00:41:48.544
to cleanse Himself and to be in a holy condition.

00:41:48.745 --> 00:41:51.036
Because you see when you clear other people,

00:41:51.036 --> 00:41:54.282
when you create something,

00:41:54.282 --> 00:41:58.749
then you want to have some time to yourself and to enjoy yourself.

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:01.328
That’s why He got this holiday.

00:42:01.328 --> 00:42:07.944
Here it is permanent holiday not holy day, holly means hollow.

00:42:07.944 --> 00:42:10.444
It’s hollow day.

00:42:10.444 --> 00:42:13.817
And this madness of holiday

00:42:13.817 --> 00:42:18.935
is of course I am working out on my level to cut it down.

00:42:21.348 --> 00:42:26.214
This is the time one has to really get into Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:26.214 --> 00:42:33.286
to work hard, is the time to give up all your lethargies.

00:42:36.547 --> 00:42:41.039
You have to get out of your sleep.

00:42:41.039 --> 00:42:44.063
I have seen people – I’ve told, she asked Me that,

00:42:44.063 --> 00:42:46.466
“Mother we would like to have your puja”. I said, “I know

00:42:46.466 --> 00:42:50.919
why you want to have puja is good because puja means flooding.”

00:42:50.919 --> 00:42:55.863
The floods come in, ah everybody feels fine.

00:42:55.863 --> 00:42:59.879
Some feel fine for a month, some for a week,

00:42:59.879 --> 00:43:02.633
some for a day, some for an hour.

00:43:02.633 --> 00:43:06.641
Again, as it is.

00:43:12.355 --> 00:43:17.584
Because with flooding

00:43:17.584 --> 00:43:20.870
you feel the water has come inside.

00:43:20.870 --> 00:43:24.798
But it should be needed; there should be some depth.

00:43:24.798 --> 00:43:31.060
That is not done. Every Sahaja Yogi must do it every day,

00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:34.748
is a part of his life.

00:43:34.748 --> 00:43:39.502
Cleansing is a part of his life. Is just like brushing his teeth.

00:43:39.502 --> 00:43:44.193
Even if he does not brush his teeth does not matter.

00:43:44.414 --> 00:43:49.485
I do not brush My teeth every night. You might have noticed it.

00:43:49.485 --> 00:43:54.683
I need not brush. My teeth are still solid and I was asking My husband,

00:43:54.884 --> 00:43:58.358
“When do the human beings lose their teeth?”

00:43:58.358 --> 00:44:02.930
He said, “You have already passed that age.”

00:44:02.930 --> 00:44:06.359
I said, “That means I will never lose My teeth?”

00:44:06.359 --> 00:44:09.822
He said, “May not.” But I never brush My teeth in the night

00:44:09.822 --> 00:44:14.631
before sleeping as you people religiously do.

00:44:16.417 --> 00:44:19.905
The most important thing is cleansing yourself every night.

00:44:19.905 --> 00:44:24.858
Whether you cleanse it with water or rub it yourself with salt

00:44:24.858 --> 00:44:33.777
or with butter or you do the tratrika, with the flame,

00:44:33.777 --> 00:44:35.991
do what you like

00:44:35.991 --> 00:44:39.587
but you have to pay attention to your cleansing every night.

00:44:39.587 --> 00:44:43.773
And morning time you have to surrender

00:44:43.773 --> 00:44:45.972
before doing anything else.

00:44:45.972 --> 00:44:51.171
You have to get up early? All right get up early.

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:58.155
Do what you like but you have to work hard.

00:44:58.718 --> 00:45:05.244
And you have to think every day what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

00:45:10.244 --> 00:45:13.631
It’s not the same cycle we are going to start you see.

00:45:13.631 --> 00:45:17.877
Once you have denied materialism you became hippies,

00:45:17.877 --> 00:45:20.834
now after coming out of that we are not going to start

00:45:20.834 --> 00:45:24.925
the same cycle of materialism.

00:45:28.058 --> 00:45:32.574
This is a new way where we have to go,

00:45:32.574 --> 00:45:36.137
where we understand our detachments from things.

00:45:36.137 --> 00:45:39.387
It’s all right.

00:45:39.387 --> 00:45:41.832
We are not going to run away from matter

00:45:41.832 --> 00:45:45.070
but we are going to master it. If we get it well and good

00:45:45.271 --> 00:45:47.578
if we don’t get it well and good, it’s just the same,

00:45:47.578 --> 00:45:51.316
makes no difference.

00:45:54.946 --> 00:45:58.375
And hard work is needed now, real hard work I tell you

00:45:58.375 --> 00:46:00.343
because now I’m going to America.

00:46:00.343 --> 00:46:03.113
When I am there, there is so much of lethargy;

00:46:03.113 --> 00:46:08.058
when I don’t allow you to sleep after 6 o’clock even if you try.

00:46:08.058 --> 00:46:11.042
I’ve done that if you notice,

00:46:11.042 --> 00:46:15.964
rather difficult for people to sleep after six.

00:46:15.964 --> 00:46:20.852
But, still,

00:46:20.852 --> 00:46:23.829
when I go away you have to really work very hard

00:46:23.829 --> 00:46:26.423
and keep yourself clean every day

00:46:26.423 --> 00:46:29.439
and write it down on a piece of paper.

00:46:29.439 --> 00:46:34.106
By the time I come back again I find all my horses.

00:46:35.098 --> 00:46:38.576
That’s not going to be this time.

00:46:38.576 --> 00:46:41.306
Today you have to promise Me that,

00:46:41.306 --> 00:46:44.108
that all of you are going to work very hard,

00:46:44.108 --> 00:46:47.716
cleanse yourself completely. Go all out.

00:46:47.716 --> 00:46:52.422
After all, this country is not so big to travel.

00:46:53.367 --> 00:46:57.913
It makes a big impressive. You have seen Australian Times.

00:46:57.913 --> 00:47:03.254
I had only one Sahaja Yogi with me thank God, that was Mr. Regis.

00:47:03.254 --> 00:47:07.930
I was only controlling him. Only one horse I had to control

00:47:07.930 --> 00:47:11.017
and he was all right. He behaved very well,

00:47:11.017 --> 00:47:13.120
otherwise he could have gone off you know.

00:47:13.120 --> 00:47:16.509
Anything is possible under the sun.

00:47:16.509 --> 00:47:20.491
But he behaved very well. He was quite under control

00:47:20.491 --> 00:47:23.311
and they were impressed by his presence there

00:47:23.311 --> 00:47:27.450
and they called him serene. Imagine Regis very serene.

00:47:27.450 --> 00:47:29.878
And he was very sweet I must say

00:47:29.878 --> 00:47:32.926
and he explained to them very well because he is well educated,

00:47:32.926 --> 00:47:35.402
he is a doctor.

00:47:35.402 --> 00:47:38.938
Today I played a trick on him though, I’m sorry for that.

00:47:38.938 --> 00:47:42.576
It was too much, whatever it is,

00:47:42.576 --> 00:47:47.263
but he, it worked out and he’s done it well.

00:47:47.263 --> 00:47:51.120
In the same way it is you people I have seen it

00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:53.217
and said it again and again,

00:47:53.217 --> 00:47:57.677
that you are the people who are going to

00:47:57.677 --> 00:48:00.487
bring Sahaja Yoga on this earth.

00:48:00.487 --> 00:48:06.366
You are the people who are going to do it. I am nothing.

00:48:10.652 --> 00:48:17.046
You see now when there is waterfall,

00:48:17.046 --> 00:48:21.863
what energy do you see? Nothing, it’s just a waterfall.

00:48:22.681 --> 00:48:26.177
But when you put it to turbines

00:48:26.177 --> 00:48:29.970
and take out that electricity from the turbines

00:48:29.970 --> 00:48:35.700
and then you see them here then you say, "yes there is electricity".

00:48:39.018 --> 00:48:44.300
Whatever is potential has no meaning.

00:48:44.300 --> 00:48:50.927
Whatever is kinetic, whatever is showing has a meaning.

00:48:50.927 --> 00:48:54.866
And so it is for you

00:48:54.866 --> 00:48:59.490
to be the showpieces of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

00:48:59.490 --> 00:49:02.053
Because some will say

00:49:02.053 --> 00:49:04.701
that, “Oh you may be, so what,

00:49:04.701 --> 00:49:07.264
you are a different clan altogether.”

00:49:07.264 --> 00:49:12.352
Some may say that,

00:49:12.352 --> 00:49:14.684
“Oh we can’t believe you.”

00:49:14.684 --> 00:49:18.001
But they will believe you much more they will believe Me.

00:49:18.001 --> 00:49:22.811
They will not believe Me at all. They’ll say I’m fantastic.

00:49:22.811 --> 00:49:26.442
I, I cannot be understood, you see?

00:49:26.442 --> 00:49:29.529
So they won’t believe Me, they will believe you.

00:49:29.529 --> 00:49:33.116
They will not trust Me, but they will trust you.

00:49:33.116 --> 00:49:35.917
They would not trust Christ but they will trust you

00:49:35.917 --> 00:49:40.077
because you are one of them.

00:49:42.006 --> 00:49:45.875
That is why it is important that you should improve

00:49:45.875 --> 00:49:52.836
in all sincerity, in all truthfulness to yourself.

00:49:53.598 --> 00:49:58.717
Become a perfect mechanism of God.

00:49:58.717 --> 00:50:01.344
No reservations, should be no reservation.

00:50:01.344 --> 00:50:05.589
You see thinking, “All right, if I do this much

00:50:05.589 --> 00:50:08.827
then it’s all right, then I come back.”

00:50:08.827 --> 00:50:10.907
This is not all out effort.

00:50:10.907 --> 00:50:14.907
It seems to be very common you see, ‘cutting corners’ as they say.

00:50:14.907 --> 00:50:18.918
“Oh this much, all right, should I do this much

00:50:18.918 --> 00:50:21.180
or should I do this much?”

00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:24.148
I’ve seen very much discretion is used for all these things.

00:50:24.148 --> 00:50:29.640
It’s typical you see, “How many people so how many sandwiches?

00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.064
They will eat at the most two or three

00:50:32.064 --> 00:50:35.775
what’s the use of making more? So but everybody will not eat three

00:50:35.775 --> 00:50:40.314
so make it say two is all right, somebody will eat one.”

00:50:40.314 --> 00:50:43.314
These calculations, see?

00:50:44.111 --> 00:50:47.913
Who will eat one? The one who is calculating should not eat at all,

00:50:47.913 --> 00:50:51.409
then that’s the best way.

00:50:51.409 --> 00:50:54.648
But it’s all this calculations starts in the mind, you see,

00:50:54.648 --> 00:50:58.282
and these calculations ruin you.

00:51:00.941 --> 00:51:04.982
It’s a very tricky path. I know it’s very tricky.

00:51:04.982 --> 00:51:12.308
But you have beacons before you. Really I tell you, ‘lit’.

00:51:12.509 --> 00:51:14.752
Nobody had that.

00:51:14.752 --> 00:51:18.593
And you have got the torches in your hand.

00:51:18.593 --> 00:51:23.413
And you have a balancing way automatically in built.

00:51:23.413 --> 00:51:28.714
Just trust in all those things, and if you walk straight forward,

00:51:28.714 --> 00:51:32.954
straight forward, forget all that is past,

00:51:32.954 --> 00:51:37.843
all that is nonsensical. Forget it, you are a different person.

00:51:37.843 --> 00:51:41.430
I’m sure you’ll rise very fast.

00:51:42.430 --> 00:51:47.530
And you will be really a living, organized being.

00:51:47.530 --> 00:51:53.040
All of you put together. Living, organized.

00:51:53.040 --> 00:51:57.167
These two are not complimentary ever.

00:51:57.167 --> 00:52:00.763
Because living is always disorganized,

00:52:00.834 --> 00:52:03.104
according to human concept like

00:52:03.104 --> 00:52:05.312
they will say that this flower comes out this way t

00:52:05.312 --> 00:52:08.548
hat should come out that way. That human being’s thinking

00:52:08.548 --> 00:52:12.595
but God thinks that this is the wayit is organized.

00:52:12.595 --> 00:52:19.055
So, living organized means organized in the will of God.

00:52:20.534 --> 00:52:27.431
That’s how Sahaja Yogi are going to form that nucleus,

00:52:27.431 --> 00:52:33.931
that great nucleus, that powerful nucleus,

00:52:33.931 --> 00:52:40.074
that tremendous source

00:52:40.074 --> 00:52:45.383
which is going to overthrow all that is nonsensical.

00:52:46.859 --> 00:52:50.970
It is tremendous, believe Me.

00:52:52.183 --> 00:52:56.492
May God bless you
