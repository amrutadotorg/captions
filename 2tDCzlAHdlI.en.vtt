00:01.595 --> 00:05.341
Hello Anne, how are you?

00:06.611 --> 00:12.416
Seminar in Mill Farm – Sherborne, Dorset (UK), 2 August 1981.

00:17.117 --> 00:20.162
What a beautiful place we are all in.

00:20.362 --> 00:26.858
It’s a real blessing of Sahaja Yoga for all of you to relax,

00:27.058 --> 00:34.629
relax well. Because in relaxation only you realize that,

00:34.829 --> 00:38.112
we are now realized souls.

00:38.312 --> 00:44.641
That we have entered into the kingdom of heaven.

00:44.841 --> 00:49.753
That we can see the beauty what God has created around us.

00:49.953 --> 00:52.558
That we have become sensitive to His grace

00:52.758 --> 00:56.891
and to His kindness and to His love.

01:05.506 --> 01:09.680
It’s a seminar that you have arranged and I’m very happy.

01:09.880 --> 01:12.063
I always wanted you to arrange seminars

01:12.263 --> 01:16.212
and that you all should meet together and live together,

01:16.412 --> 01:20.249
and understand each other.

01:20.449 --> 01:24.398
The seminars on the gross level

01:24.598 --> 01:28.919
they work out many things no doubt.

01:29.119 --> 01:35.740
But on subtler levels, seminars of the Sahaja yogis,

01:35.940 --> 01:38.345
means a lot.

01:38.545 --> 01:45.438
It means that a strong nucleus is being consolidated

01:45.638 --> 01:49.254
in various places in a country.

01:49.454 --> 01:53.316
And these strongholds

01:53.516 --> 02:00.500
or we can say the strong nucleus which is created like this,

02:00.700 --> 02:05.338
can form a mechanism by which

02:05.538 --> 02:13.111
beams of strong vibrations could flow

02:13.311 --> 02:16.065
or could be thrown all over the places.

02:16.265 --> 02:25.227
It’s a very great task to build up these mechanisms,

02:25.427 --> 02:34.204
these divine mechanisms in different parts of your country.

02:35.659 --> 02:39.237
Please, take her out for a while.

02:44.877 --> 02:49.349
For example, Mother Earth has done Her job.

02:49.549 --> 02:54.779
Wherever it was possible for Her, She has created

02:54.979 --> 03:01.389
living deities

03:01.589 --> 03:05.643
to show that God exists.

03:05.843 --> 03:09.455
That you can now test their vibrations and see for yourself

03:09.655 --> 03:11.769
how She has worked very hard.

03:11.969 --> 03:18.566
She has created all this beautiful universe.

03:19.785 --> 03:23.155
She has created you also.

03:23.355 --> 03:28.214
She has created the kundalini within you.

03:29.292 --> 03:34.222
She represents the beautiful nature we can say.

03:36.018 --> 03:41.247
In Her company, in Her bounties when you are drenched

03:41.447 --> 03:45.603
and you all meet each other,

03:45.803 --> 03:47.761
you see for yourself

03:47.961 --> 03:52.414
that how She blesses all of you just the same.

03:53.195 --> 03:57.266
There is no difference

03:57.466 --> 04:00.362
between you and any other person for Her.

04:00.562 --> 04:03.721
But those who are sensitive, are subtler people,

04:03.921 --> 04:09.117
enjoy Her much more than you people do.

04:12.296 --> 04:15.283
Now the problem that exists in every country

04:15.483 --> 04:18.471
has its own style I have seen.

04:18.671 --> 04:23.862
And as in this country also we have a style of problems

04:24.062 --> 04:27.914
which comes. Gradually it’s changing its form.

04:28.114 --> 04:32.899
In the beginning I found that people were overaggressive,

04:33.099 --> 04:40.322
sceptical and also could be rude also sometimes.

04:40.522 --> 04:43.720
It’s all right. Makes no difference to Me.

04:43.920 --> 04:47.433
Now gradually they started changing over.

04:47.633 --> 04:55.090
Now they are becoming aware of what they have got,

04:55.290 --> 04:59.052
what role they are playing, how important it is to be an Englishman.

05:01.130 --> 05:04.019
And when I say English I mean all the English people,

05:04.219 --> 05:07.006
not Wales or anything different,

05:07.207 --> 05:13.375
and how they have to become

05:13.575 --> 05:17.061
part and parcel of the heart of the universe.

05:17.261 --> 05:19.344
I wondered how many of you really realize

05:19.544 --> 05:23.473
how important it is to be an Englishman.

05:24.348 --> 05:29.110
That everything that happens in this country circulates.

05:29.310 --> 05:31.807
For example if this royal wedding had taken place

05:32.007 --> 05:37.269
in any other royal family it would not have circulated so much.

05:37.469 --> 05:39.353
Everything circulates from this country.

05:39.553 --> 05:41.889
Maybe you may not think much of yourself.

05:42.089 --> 05:44.701
You may think that what is so great

05:44.901 --> 05:48.168
after all this England is like any other country.

05:48.369 --> 05:53.913
But you see why people accept so many things from you?

05:54.113 --> 05:56.133
Like even a monarchy,

05:56.333 --> 06:01.016
I mean most of the countries have thrown away their monarchies.

06:01.216 --> 06:06.612
And in this country it exists and it has a respectable position.

06:06.812 --> 06:11.368
And the symbol of a monarchy

06:11.568 --> 06:16.880
is still lingering here in a very proud way.

06:17.701 --> 06:19.752
Then the marriage itself,

06:19.952 --> 06:22.022
the marriages of royal families are always detested

06:22.222 --> 06:26.073
and protested and nobody is interested.

06:26.274 --> 06:29.479
And such a auspicious thing should take place here

06:29.679 --> 06:33.284
and that everybody should see it.

06:33.484 --> 06:37.135
So many countries should watch it and appreciate it

06:37.335 --> 06:40.667
and enjoy it of all the things.

06:40.867 --> 06:44.492
It’s something surprising.

06:45.079 --> 06:49.026
It transcends all rationality,

06:49.226 --> 06:53.465
all understanding of even logic

06:53.666 --> 06:55.511
we can say that what is the logic behind it?

06:55.711 --> 06:57.530
But if you are enjoying it you just enjoy.

06:57.730 --> 07:02.574
You don’t want to think about it why you are enjoying.

07:03.505 --> 07:06.870
So, one has to understand that you are part and parcel

07:07.070 --> 07:12.180
of the heart of the universe.

07:13.729 --> 07:17.390
One thing is essential

07:17.590 --> 07:22.743
that you have to be very flexible people.

07:22.943 --> 07:26.871
You have to have

07:27.072 --> 07:33.033
the flexibility of the heart cells we can say.

07:35.472 --> 07:40.440
Now heart has to pump.

07:40.640 --> 07:46.265
It has to be strong.

07:47.278 --> 07:50.488
And surprisingly lion is your emblem.

07:50.688 --> 07:54.441
So you have to have a lion’s heart.

07:54.641 --> 07:56.743
And lion’s heart means he is not afraid.

07:56.943 --> 08:01.662
He is the king. He knows he’s the king and he lives like a king.

08:03.802 --> 08:08.876
Like a lion and Leo as in astrology

08:09.076 --> 08:14.392
or if you say is a man who is extremely generous,

08:14.592 --> 08:16.807
lion hearted, not afraid of anyone.

08:17.007 --> 08:21.187
There should be no fear.

08:23.047 --> 08:25.082
But English language if you read anyone

08:25.282 --> 08:27.144
or if you listen to anyone,

08:27.344 --> 08:30.169
every third sentence he’ll come with the word,

08:30.369 --> 08:32.802
“I’m afraid.

08:33.002 --> 08:36.177
I’m afraid to say, I’m afraid this is so”…

08:36.377 --> 08:40.911
This word must be dropped out from the vocabulary of Sahaja yogis.

08:41.111 --> 08:44.798
What is there to be afraid of?

08:45.550 --> 08:47.512
Some people say that this is said because we do not want

08:47.712 --> 08:51.071
to hurt other people. There are so many other ways

08:51.272 --> 08:53.332
of saying things without hurting others.

08:53.532 --> 08:56.894
But what is there to be afraid of?

08:57.094 --> 09:01.183
A man who is weak cannot love.

09:01.383 --> 09:05.832
Only a strong person can love.

09:06.032 --> 09:08.043
If you talk of love first of all see

09:08.243 --> 09:11.045
whether you are strong enough to love or not.

09:11.245 --> 09:14.115
Loving is not a easy thing, even carnal love,

09:14.315 --> 09:17.635
even loving your beloved of in the ordinary sense.

09:17.835 --> 09:20.252
It’s not a easy thing.

09:20.452 --> 09:25.299
You have to have a very strong moral concept,

09:25.499 --> 09:30.604
otherwise every third minute people start changing their loves.

09:30.973 --> 09:33.353
That kind of a love has no meaning.

09:33.553 --> 09:42.483
You have to have a very firm ideas.

09:42.683 --> 09:47.183
Not only ideas in your brain but built within you.

09:49.891 --> 09:54.045
Very few people can really have a love as Romeo had,

09:54.245 --> 09:56.232
I can tell you this.

09:56.432 --> 09:59.643
It’s easy to think that you are a Romeo, it’s different.

09:59.843 --> 10:02.854
You can think you are you are the King of England,

10:03.054 --> 10:06.651
it’s all right. But you don’t become that way.

10:06.851 --> 10:10.690
So to be Romeo itself

10:10.890 --> 10:15.026
you have to have a tremendous character.

10:15.226 --> 10:22.048
A tremendous sense of sacrifice and love

10:22.248 --> 10:26.634
and understanding of what you want.

10:26.834 --> 10:33.343
You want to love, that’s all nothing beyond or before.

10:35.948 --> 10:37.869
I mean a man when he falls in love

10:38.070 --> 10:40.326
he falls in love forever and ever and ever.

10:40.526 --> 10:45.736
If he falls in love many a times it cannot be love.

10:45.936 --> 10:48.009
So that experience also

10:48.209 --> 10:54.732
is sort of is a forbidden fruit for most of them.

10:59.847 --> 11:07.686
So to love God is even more difficult,

11:07.886 --> 11:11.415
without seeing Him, without knowing Him,

11:11.615 --> 11:16.118
without knowing His bounties, without getting realization.

11:16.318 --> 11:20.143
It is very difficult.

11:20.343 --> 11:24.820
But today that is not the case.

11:27.914 --> 11:32.983
But still you have to have

11:33.183 --> 11:37.092
no fear in your mind, trust,

11:37.292 --> 11:40.947
you trust yourself and trust others.

11:41.147 --> 11:45.358
First of all try to trust yourself.

11:46.610 --> 11:48.754
If you have made mistakes, you have to say,

11:48.954 --> 11:53.339
“Yes, I have made mistakes, all right so what?”

11:53.539 --> 11:56.698
Trust yourself that you can correct yourself also.

11:56.898 --> 12:01.406
Trusting doesn’t mean blind ego trip. It does not mean that.

12:01.606 --> 12:05.203
Trust means that “Yes I can correct myself.

12:05.403 --> 12:10.762
I can improve. I can do better.”

12:10.962 --> 12:17.340
Some people think that if you trust yourself

12:17.540 --> 12:20.504
then you should never confess anything that you have done wrong.

12:20.704 --> 12:24.842
That you should never say that it was wrong and I can correct.

12:25.042 --> 12:32.046
This is a wrong idea. You have to trust yourself by saying that,

12:32.246 --> 12:36.564
“Yes I have done mistakes. I have been doing wrong.

12:36.764 --> 12:39.736
I have been faltering but I can correct.

12:39.936 --> 12:41.759
I have that strength within me.

12:41.959 --> 12:43.728
I can rise above all these things.

12:43.928 --> 12:51.477
I have that thing within me which I can use to my advantage.”

12:55.861 --> 12:59.514
Trust yourself. Trust that you are realized souls.

12:59.714 --> 13:01.714
Trust that God loves you.

13:01.915 --> 13:06.759
That He has chosen you to be His instrument.

13:06.959 --> 13:10.709
Love yourself.

13:13.178 --> 13:16.125
You are unique no doubt.

13:16.325 --> 13:20.719
As it is human beings, every individual is an unique person.

13:20.919 --> 13:25.010
But after realization

13:25.210 --> 13:29.468
you are definitely unique person.

13:33.122 --> 13:37.380
It never means ego trip. One has to use

13:37.580 --> 13:42.255
discretion about understanding. It never means ego trip.

13:42.455 --> 13:47.931
If you cannot correct yourself, you are not master of yourself.

13:52.597 --> 13:56.683
Yes you are not perfect.

13:58.714 --> 14:03.168
You are unique but you are not perfect. You have to perfect yourself.

14:03.832 --> 14:08.517
These words can be very confusing. When I say you are unique

14:08.717 --> 14:10.428
immediately, you think you are perfect.

14:10.628 --> 14:14.784
These are two words, unique and perfect.

14:15.084 --> 14:17.931
Somebody can be unique

14:18.131 --> 14:21.042
but he can have imperfections.

14:21.242 --> 14:23.901
So you have to perfect yourself.

14:24.101 --> 14:26.878
And trust in yourself that you can perfect yourself,

14:27.078 --> 14:30.648
through your kundalini awakening, clearing your charkas.

14:30.848 --> 14:36.028
By understanding yourself, you can perfect yourself.

14:37.061 --> 14:43.009
You have to perfect. I have so many ways I tell you;

14:43.209 --> 14:47.468
directly, sometimes indirectly, through friends,

14:47.668 --> 14:52.972
somehow point out that this is the problem with you.

14:54.732 --> 14:57.258
You should think that I am within you.

14:57.458 --> 15:02.290
I am that part within you which is discretion.

15:02.490 --> 15:05.219
When you do not understand your own discretion,

15:05.419 --> 15:12.339
I try to give you the direction by this way or that way.

15:12.539 --> 15:17.549
But people feel hurt. People feel bad

15:17.749 --> 15:19.971
or, some of them accept it.

15:20.171 --> 15:24.105
If you are seekers and if you are ascending,

15:24.305 --> 15:26.824
you are definitely unique,

15:27.024 --> 15:31.026
one specially blessed.

15:31.226 --> 15:33.567
And you have to pay special attention to yourself.

15:33.767 --> 15:38.181
You can’t afford to play with yourself.

15:39.064 --> 15:46.207
So you have to discriminate between ego

15:46.407 --> 15:51.264
or ego trips as they call it

15:51.464 --> 15:55.230
and ascent.

15:55.958 --> 16:02.981
Ego trips bring you back with the worst hurting.

16:03.590 --> 16:07.679
It would be something like throwing you in the air

16:07.879 --> 16:09.938
and again you come back with a bump and break

16:10.138 --> 16:13.219
one of your necks or something like that.

16:13.419 --> 16:15.042
That’s what ego trip is.

16:15.242 --> 16:20.384
But ascent is where you really rise above.

16:20.584 --> 16:23.306
Not only that you rise

16:23.506 --> 16:27.137
but with you,

16:27.337 --> 16:29.379
you make others rise.

16:29.579 --> 16:35.704
In your ascent, you develop tremendous powers.

16:36.883 --> 16:39.558
The higher you ascend the better it is.

16:39.758 --> 16:42.795
But not by understanding that I am perfect you can ascend,

16:42.995 --> 16:46.629
never so.

16:49.544 --> 16:54.286
There’s a story of a teacher and a student.

16:57.500 --> 17:00.028
The teacher was very kind to the student

17:00.228 --> 17:03.701
and he would come and show him his creations.

17:03.901 --> 17:07.424
He was very kind to him.

17:08.490 --> 17:10.391
And every time he would say that,

17:10.591 --> 17:12.352
“I have done this good

17:12.552 --> 17:15.015
and this is the thing that I have not been able to do

17:15.215 --> 17:18.550
so will you please tell me how to correct it?”

17:18.850 --> 17:21.502
And the teacher would say, “Yes, good,

17:21.702 --> 17:25.709
you better correct this part, then do this.”

17:27.187 --> 17:32.790
And one day the student came and said, “Now this is perfect”.

17:32.990 --> 17:38.205
He said, “You are no more student now.”

17:41.111 --> 17:45.546
So he said, “No more. You are not to come to me anymore.”

17:45.746 --> 17:52.814
There was another

17:53.014 --> 17:58.669
student who was coming every day and correcting himself.

18:01.256 --> 18:04.295
And he told to his teacher that,

18:04.495 --> 18:08.487
“Today I think I can teach others but not yet perfect”.

18:08.687 --> 18:12.585
He said, “All right you go and teach.”

18:15.202 --> 18:19.084
The third one was a student who came

18:19.284 --> 18:25.572
and he was always trying to see what was the mistake

18:25.772 --> 18:28.822
and how he has to correct and how he worked very hard,

18:29.022 --> 18:32.991
very assiduous, very hard working.

18:34.467 --> 18:42.379
And he came to his teacher one day and he said, “Sir,

18:42.579 --> 18:45.184
I will not trouble you anymore now”.

18:45.384 --> 18:49.860
He said, “True. Now you take my seat.”

18:55.898 --> 18:59.401
That is what one has to understand.

18:59.601 --> 19:01.956
You ascend.

19:02.156 --> 19:04.526
You will become humbler.

19:04.726 --> 19:06.721
It is just the other way around people understand.

19:06.921 --> 19:10.605
You see when they ascend they think we have achieved some special powers.

19:10.805 --> 19:14.714
I don’t know. Suddenly self-certification starts you see.

19:14.914 --> 19:17.151
I am very good in spirituality.

19:17.351 --> 19:20.822
I am very high up and all that, this self-certificate starts.

19:21.023 --> 19:24.856
And then it can reach such a point

19:25.056 --> 19:29.923
that suddenly you found you are on the earth again.

19:31.565 --> 19:35.342
This kind of thing is not the way it works out.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.875
Actually the people who ascend

19:38.075 --> 19:43.856
there are certain qualities that show on them.

19:44.699 --> 19:48.296
The first thing is your collectivity.

19:48.496 --> 19:52.418
How collective you are.

19:53.342 --> 19:55.908
With how many people you can carry on.

19:56.108 --> 20:00.006
At how many things you can laugh.

20:01.092 --> 20:05.187
That is one of the biggest qualities.

20:05.751 --> 20:08.066
The second quality is that

20:08.266 --> 20:12.537
how much you accept another’s domination

20:12.737 --> 20:16.450
who, cuts down your collectivity.

20:16.651 --> 20:20.382
You must have your personality separate from everyone.

20:20.582 --> 20:26.274
If you allow others to cut your personality,

20:26.474 --> 20:31.689
say for example, there is a boss and you are the,

20:31.889 --> 20:34.382
you are the employee.

20:34.582 --> 20:38.469
And the boss is not realized soul and you are an realized soul.

20:38.669 --> 20:42.403
Or maybe both are realized souls. Take it like that.

20:42.603 --> 20:50.229
And one of them is ascending.

20:50.429 --> 20:53.018
Then he becomes humbler, he becomes better,

20:53.218 --> 20:58.015
there are congenial relationship, but to a point.

20:58.579 --> 21:00.931
He will never compromise with his boss

21:01.131 --> 21:03.790
when it comes to his ascent, to his collectivity,

21:03.990 --> 21:07.609
to his giving, to his doing things for others.

21:07.809 --> 21:16.518
On that point he’ll never have any domination because

21:16.718 --> 21:19.908
how much you feel responsible about yourself

21:20.108 --> 21:24.642
is the second point.

21:24.842 --> 21:29.167
How much you are responsible to be there,

21:29.367 --> 21:31.817
to be a cell in the heart.

21:32.017 --> 21:36.713
Any cell that fails, fails the heart.

21:39.968 --> 21:46.371
Every cell in the heart has to be extremely sensitive

21:46.571 --> 21:53.826
and extremely obedient to the Self, to the Spirit.

21:56.271 --> 21:59.845
It has to activate, work harder when there is need,

22:00.045 --> 22:03.744
there emergency.

22:03.944 --> 22:08.803
That it enjoys the most.

22:11.162 --> 22:18.603
And no impurity should be allowed, the third point now.

22:18.803 --> 22:26.688
As I told you first is collectivity, secondly your responsibility

22:26.888 --> 22:29.393
and third point is purity.

22:29.593 --> 22:33.833
Purity of your own heart first of all,

22:34.033 --> 22:39.857
of your own heart, about sincerity, cunningness.

22:40.057 --> 22:45.285
As I am saying this you will be realizing that all Englishmen

22:45.485 --> 22:50.754
believe in the contrary,

22:50.954 --> 22:55.872
nowadays, not olden times, but nowadays.

22:56.072 --> 23:00.590
Clean heart, transparent, open heart.

23:00.790 --> 23:03.403
Trust others.

23:03.603 --> 23:08.840
Talk to everyone with an open heart.

23:09.040 --> 23:12.321
Trust others.

23:14.401 --> 23:16.623
Why do you doubt? If you do not doubt yourself,

23:16.823 --> 23:19.586
you’ll not doubt others.

23:19.987 --> 23:22.101
What are they going to take away from you?

23:22.301 --> 23:25.621
What have you got?

23:25.965 --> 23:29.118
Nobody can take away your nose, eyes, nothing.

23:29.318 --> 23:35.410
It’s all quite intact. It’s all nicely glued down.

23:35.610 --> 23:40.098
So nothing is going to disappear.

23:40.298 --> 23:49.519
What are they going to hurt to a person who is a realized soul?

23:50.950 --> 23:52.774
If your heart is clean,

23:52.974 --> 23:56.780
you can see the other person clearly through and through.

23:56.980 --> 24:00.875
Innocence is such a powerful thing,

24:01.075 --> 24:04.190
such a powerful thing that even a glance

24:04.390 --> 24:09.608
is sufficient to kill a Satan.

24:11.460 --> 24:16.229
Purity of heart, actually when the heart becomes impure

24:16.429 --> 24:20.856
the impurity flows down to other places.

24:23.942 --> 24:26.392
It is not the other way round, is from the heart.

24:26.592 --> 24:29.869
Many people believe that it’s the body

24:30.069 --> 24:32.995
that becomes impure. I think it is the heart,

24:33.195 --> 24:35.441
which becomes really impure,

24:35.641 --> 24:37.683
and then it starts trickling down to the body

24:37.883 --> 24:42.571
and then it is residual there. It settles down there.

24:46.332 --> 24:52.011
So have a clean open heart like a child’s heart. Open heart.

24:53.386 --> 24:57.279
What is there to be afraid of anyone?

24:57.479 --> 25:01.386
What is there not to trust anyone?

25:02.839 --> 25:07.300
What is there to be angry with anyone?

25:08.987 --> 25:13.022
Talk to everyone, shake hands with everyone,

25:13.222 --> 25:17.480
be nice to everyone. On the way you find somebody’s difficulty,

25:17.680 --> 25:21.849
give him a hand. If somebody cannot sit properly e.

25:22.049 --> 25:25.872
or has a problem you try to remove the problem.

25:26.072 --> 25:30.541
If the person cannot stand, give the place.

25:33.048 --> 25:35.345
Try to give from your clean heart.

25:35.545 --> 25:40.100
If your heart is not clean, it can never give.

25:43.629 --> 25:47.938
Now how do you clean the heart is the subject

25:48.138 --> 25:50.344
which Felicity wanted me to discuss,

25:50.544 --> 25:52.064
is how to clean the heart.

25:52.264 --> 25:57.439
There is no broom available for that in the supermarket.

26:00.886 --> 26:05.792
There are no Fairy liquids or anything to wash it down.

26:14.358 --> 26:18.510
But there is a way.

26:18.710 --> 26:22.276
Allow your heart to be drenched in your Mother’s love.

26:22.476 --> 26:26.281
Just allow. See how much She loves you.

26:27.220 --> 26:29.770
I trust you.

26:29.970 --> 26:32.714
People laugh at Me sometimes. Some of these saints

26:32.914 --> 26:34.926
who are supposed to be very great people,

26:35.126 --> 26:36.973
they can’t understand how I trust you.

26:37.173 --> 26:41.030
They’d say that oh these are all lost races?

26:41.230 --> 26:45.546
These are horrible people how do you trust them.

26:45.746 --> 26:49.212
They are not sanyasis, they are not sadhus, they are nothing.

26:49.412 --> 26:52.276
They are ordinary people.

26:52.476 --> 26:56.026
For them I mean your value is nothing.

26:56.226 --> 26:58.035
They’ll if you go to them

26:58.235 --> 27:02.352
they will make you stand on your head for three months.

27:02.552 --> 27:05.299
For three years, they may hang you on a well.

27:05.499 --> 27:08.940
I don’t know what they will do to test you.

27:09.140 --> 27:11.972
But I trusted you the day I saw you.

27:12.172 --> 27:15.222
The day you came to me I trusted you.

27:15.422 --> 27:18.776
And I worked on you from the very first day,

27:18.976 --> 27:23.712
knowing what you are but I trust your Spirit

27:23.912 --> 27:27.948
that it would shine, in the same way, trust.

27:28.148 --> 27:32.776
We laugh at others. I have seen Sahaja Yogis laugh at others;

27:32.976 --> 27:37.656
make fun of them when they come to Me.

27:38.470 --> 27:39.840
Trust them.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.376
When you will trust them, you will respect them also.

27:46.313 --> 27:50.597
So you have to believe

27:50.797 --> 27:58.850
in yourself and enjoy the way

27:59.050 --> 28:03.504
gently you are sweeping

28:03.704 --> 28:06.795
into the current of your Mother’s love.

28:06.995 --> 28:10.736
Just enjoy that.

28:12.455 --> 28:17.231
Like a flower that falls into the current

28:17.431 --> 28:23.796
and flows and enjoys all the beauties of that current.

28:23.996 --> 28:27.640
In the same way,

28:27.840 --> 28:31.226
you should enjoy.

28:33.773 --> 28:39.492
When that enjoyment comes into you, you will start trusting.

28:40.398 --> 28:44.296
And trust your Mother.

28:46.524 --> 28:50.192
I try many things to correct you.

28:50.392 --> 28:54.177
But trust in one thing, that whatever I try for you

28:54.377 --> 28:58.116
or do anything,

28:58.316 --> 29:03.992
anything I may do for you it is just to clean you.

29:04.192 --> 29:07.692
That’s My job.

29:09.620 --> 29:14.039
May sometimes you might feel I am publicly saying things for you.

29:14.239 --> 29:16.642
May be your images are being ruined by that

29:16.842 --> 29:21.992
or whatever you may think. That’s not the way,

29:24.303 --> 29:30.608
is for your hitha, is for the well-being of your Spirit.

29:34.791 --> 29:39.885
And that is the most difficult job.

29:43.869 --> 29:47.725
With all this,

29:47.925 --> 29:51.489
trust in your heart.

29:52.989 --> 29:55.937
First trust yourself,

29:56.137 --> 29:58.422
trust others,

29:58.622 --> 30:01.215
other Sahaja Yogis.

30:01.415 --> 30:03.965
Love thy neighbour as thyself. Who is your neighbour?

30:04.165 --> 30:07.097
He is a Sahaja Yogi.

30:07.297 --> 30:10.297
Stand by him.

30:15.809 --> 30:18.220
And trust your Mother.

30:18.420 --> 30:23.493
As I have trusted you, you have to trust Me,

30:25.798 --> 30:28.798
and it will work out.

30:30.118 --> 30:34.778
Open your heart to this trust.

30:39.780 --> 30:43.299
You should not worry whether it would be

30:43.499 --> 30:45.832
protocolish all right or not,

30:46.032 --> 30:52.107
whether it would be absolutely respectable or not,

30:52.307 --> 30:55.380
because heart knows. Whatever your heart will do

30:55.580 --> 30:59.096
in its genuine form will be respectable,

30:59.296 --> 31:04.494
because there resides your Spirit, which manifests.

31:04.694 --> 31:08.744
That will look after you. By outer forms,

31:08.944 --> 31:13.339
whatever you try is not going to work out.

31:13.539 --> 31:18.317
It is that trust in your loving heart

31:18.517 --> 31:20.754
that is going to work. It doesn’t matter.

31:20.954 --> 31:23.733
You see today she brought some flowers.

31:23.933 --> 31:27.336
There were some supposed to be weeds according to her.

31:27.536 --> 31:29.793
She went to the station

31:29.993 --> 31:33.183
and there she was taking some flowers out.

31:33.383 --> 31:36.715
And the station master and his wife were very sweet

31:36.915 --> 31:39.742
and they said, “Oh go ahead. They are only weeds you can have them.”

31:39.942 --> 31:41.500
And they are so fragrant.

31:41.700 --> 31:44.773
One of the most fragrant flowers I have ever seen.

31:44.973 --> 31:46.884
They are just weeds.

31:47.084 --> 31:50.105
They do not conform to any formal flowers,

31:50.305 --> 31:55.977
but just few flowers attached to other flowers were most fragrant.

31:57.352 --> 32:01.920
Love gives all the sophistication and the fragrance

32:02.120 --> 32:06.057
and all the breeding that is required.

32:06.862 --> 32:12.835
Not talking of love but really loving is the way,

32:14.592 --> 32:17.772
is most enjoyable.

32:18.305 --> 32:23.241
Today I wanted to tell you something good about Greece

32:23.441 --> 32:26.510
before we start off with the Puja for about ten minutes.

32:26.710 --> 32:28.531
Very interesting things have happened.

32:28.731 --> 32:35.647
When I went to Greece, I knew that I had to go to Greece.

32:35.897 --> 32:40.733
And they told me that they believed in the beginning in one Mother,

32:40.933 --> 32:43.750
in one Primordial Mother.

32:43.950 --> 32:48.054
But after sometime there were some Indo-Aryan people,

32:48.254 --> 32:50.281
Indo-Aryan who came down to them.

32:50.481 --> 32:52.499
And they said, “Yes there is one Mother

32:52.699 --> 32:54.548
but She has many aspects

32:54.748 --> 32:58.728
and these aspects are expressed as different Gods.”

32:58.928 --> 33:02.339
And then they told about all the Gods, which you know of.

33:02.539 --> 33:05.519
But they, they later on

33:05.719 --> 33:10.456
made them absolutely human type of Gods and they spoilt it.

33:10.656 --> 33:13.574
But still there are certain things so amazing it was.

33:13.774 --> 33:17.971
Like Athena is the name of the Goddess, the Primordial Mother.

33:18.171 --> 33:23.465
But Athena Atha, Atha in Sanskrit means the primordial.

33:26.879 --> 33:30.432
And they got the word from Athena. And to the water they call

33:30.632 --> 33:34.192
Neeru, Nero. And in Sanskrit it is Nira.

33:34.392 --> 33:38.038
My name is at home is I am called as Nira,

33:38.238 --> 33:41.387
means from water.

33:46.236 --> 33:49.302
It’s very surprising how many words there are,

33:49.502 --> 33:52.746
like I said – told them about the centers. They said, “Kendro,”

33:52.946 --> 33:56.115
in Sanskrit it is Kendra.

33:56.315 --> 34:01.180
But the best was in Delphi when I went,

34:01.380 --> 34:05.680
we were surprised at something they said,

34:05.880 --> 34:11.449
“That it is the navel of the universe”.

34:12.535 --> 34:18.625
I said, “Europe is the liver and Greece is the navel.”

34:18.825 --> 34:22.669
They showed a point that is the navel it was vibrating.

34:22.869 --> 34:26.507
And not only that but they showed the most remarkable thing

34:26.707 --> 34:30.163
was that this is the mound,

34:30.363 --> 34:36.803
which is actually the expression of the navel is the mound

34:37.003 --> 34:39.349
which is actually has come out the Mother Earth

34:39.549 --> 34:41.489
is the one this one.

34:41.689 --> 34:44.405
And this is actually Athena according to them.

34:44.605 --> 34:48.266
This is that has come out of the Mother Earth.

34:48.466 --> 34:51.298
I saw the vibrations were tremendous.

34:51.498 --> 34:54.462
And next to that there were lot of vibrations coming

34:54.662 --> 34:57.980
so I turned round and what I find? Is a Ganesha,

34:58.180 --> 35:05.092
absolute Ganesha there sitting down with a beautiful trunk,

35:05.292 --> 35:10.103
the face and the ears and the eyes, and the stomach!

35:10.303 --> 35:12.104
Can you believe it?

35:12.304 --> 35:16.268
Sitting next to Her and absolutely the vibrations coming.

35:16.468 --> 35:19.778
I mean I didn’t have a photograph I mean camera or anything

35:19.978 --> 35:21.559
otherwise I would have taken a photograph

35:21.759 --> 35:23.858
but now if you go and you can see.

35:24.058 --> 35:27.787
Another thing is they showed the egg, just imagine,

35:27.987 --> 35:32.599
and the eternal egg from where the other eggs come out you see!

35:32.799 --> 35:36.037
And the eggs are shown divided the same way into spindles

35:36.237 --> 35:40.176
as they do which doctors know they have seen under microscope.

35:40.376 --> 35:44.754
But how did they see, those Greeks? God only knows.

35:44.954 --> 35:47.940
But there’s another side to it.

35:48.140 --> 35:51.538
First they use to get Amruta. t.

35:51.738 --> 35:55.819
Is the one that was meant for the Gods

35:56.019 --> 35:59.007
by which they were given eternal life

35:59.207 --> 36:03.952
in the sense they were appointed as permanent features you see.

36:04.152 --> 36:08.176
But then the same thing they wanted everybody to have

36:08.376 --> 36:11.723
so they started using some that was called as ambrosia.

36:11.923 --> 36:14.059
They converted into something else

36:14.259 --> 36:16.478
and they started calling it Ambrosia

36:16.678 --> 36:19.814
and some sort of a LSD business.

36:20.014 --> 36:22.425
So also, they went into trance

36:22.625 --> 36:26.667
so the rest of it is all supra-conscious.

36:26.867 --> 36:30.031
And that supra-conscious also side by side exists.

36:30.231 --> 36:33.234
Now discretion has to be used

36:33.434 --> 36:37.431
how around reality always supra-conscious

36:37.631 --> 36:42.880
or collective subconscious works out, one way or the other.

36:43.080 --> 36:46.106
And you have to go to the point where the reality exists.

36:46.306 --> 36:49.606
But what happens you get lost into the supra-conscious

36:49.806 --> 36:53.633
or you get lost into the superego or we can say the,

36:53.833 --> 36:56.977
the collective subconscious area.

36:57.177 --> 36:59.341
So you see both things are to be found out,

36:59.542 --> 37:01.571
Like an Indian temple, you go,

37:01.771 --> 37:04.773
you’ll find all surrounded by collective subconscious.

37:04.973 --> 37:07.244
Too much ritualism, ritualistic,

37:07.444 --> 37:09.681
ritualism takes them to the left side.

37:09.881 --> 37:17.895
With that they go to the problem of getting all these women

37:18.095 --> 37:22.387
who get spirits, they go on, “hoohoohoo” before the deities,

37:22.587 --> 37:28.025
and then they tell the name of the horse and all those things.

37:28.236 --> 37:32.294
In Mahalakshmi’ s temple, which is a real temple,

37:32.294 --> 37:35.059
where all the three deities have come out in Bombay

37:35.059 --> 37:38.192
where I used to live very close to that place,

37:38.392 --> 37:42.880
just imagine, and this is very common.

37:42.880 --> 37:47.724
So to understand how human beings reacted to that

37:47.825 --> 37:50.452
is very well shown in Delphi.

37:50.652 --> 37:53.621
It’s a beautiful thing is so done.

37:53.721 --> 37:57.077
But I was amazed at the Temple of Athena when we went there.

37:57.077 --> 38:00.405
It’s so much so near to the thing that

38:00.405 --> 38:05.061
the Mooladhara is shown there where the Kundalini exists.

38:05.161 --> 38:08.444
Now She is the one who has snakes around Her, see?

38:08.444 --> 38:11.764
And She has little, little snakes as Her children. Can you imagine?

38:11.903 --> 38:15.200
And She is one, and She has a daughter,

38:15.200 --> 38:21.595
which is the Kundalini in you and a God who is a child God.

38:22.093 --> 38:25.103
And when She stands She has a Kundalini in her hand,

38:25.103 --> 38:28.878
the snake coming out of Her hand. With all the charkas, she is made.

38:29.078 --> 38:31.291
It’s so beautifully shown.

38:31.291 --> 38:34.516
The best was Her Sanctum Sanctorum

38:34.516 --> 38:37.608
where nobody is allowed to go inside where She resides,

38:37.708 --> 38:40.005
is the Adi Kundalini.

38:40.037 --> 38:48.275
But they say that She came out of the head of Zeus,

38:49.144 --> 38:53.636
the Primordial Kundalini. And Her place nobody can go inside,

38:53.636 --> 38:57.895
nobody can reach except for Her son, the child son.

38:58.096 --> 39:01.239
But Her,

39:01.239 --> 39:04.676
Her steps are very large

39:04.676 --> 39:08.604
also are roundish. She curved. Can you imagine?

39:08.604 --> 39:12.638
They’re curved as if part of the Kundalas they are.

39:12.638 --> 39:20.328
And they are 3 ½ in height,

39:20.328 --> 39:24.364
you can see that, in height and in width also.

39:24.364 --> 39:27.253
Like every place is made of big,

39:27.454 --> 39:30.587
I mean the three are made of big stones and the last one

39:30.587 --> 39:34.950
is made of the small, three and a half, and they go in a curve.

39:34.950 --> 39:40.315
And that is Sanctum Sanctorum nobody can go inside.

39:41.793 --> 39:45.753
Now what an expression it was. This was the early Expression

39:45.753 --> 39:49.348
and Athens is after Her name Athena.

39:49.348 --> 39:53.477
If you see the face also you will find your Mother very much there.

39:53.477 --> 39:56.294
I’ve got the photographs and all that which I will show you later on.

39:56.294 --> 39:59.509
But what I’m saying the Mother Earth has done Her job.

39:59.509 --> 40:06.310
People have done their job. Christ or we can say Mohammed

40:06.310 --> 40:11.969
or Buddha, Kabira, anyone of them;

40:11.969 --> 40:15.981
they have done their jobs, alright. They have worked for you.

40:15.981 --> 40:19.505
They have created places within you. They have done their job.

40:19.505 --> 40:25.222
Now it is you who are on the stage, not Me.

40:26.642 --> 40:31.531
Sahastrara has to work it out.

40:31.531 --> 40:36.690
And Sahastrara always surrounds the heart.

40:37.293 --> 40:43.428
You are enlightened by your Spirit, which resides in your heart.

40:43.629 --> 40:50.795
And the whole Sahastrara’s mandalas are around the heart.

40:54.260 --> 41:02.633
So as you are now the temple of that Spirit,

41:02.633 --> 41:05.351
you are the heart.

41:05.351 --> 41:09.216
You have to be very, very assiduous.

41:09.216 --> 41:15.304
This is the fourth point, which is again against all Englishmen.

41:16.446 --> 41:19.589
They are holidaying permanently.

41:19.589 --> 41:22.835
The whole attention is in holidays.

41:22.835 --> 41:27.668
At the slightest pretext, they are on a holiday.

41:28.359 --> 41:33.708
The word holiday comes from the word holy day,

41:35.581 --> 41:38.993
is to do something holy on that day.

41:38.993 --> 41:45.790
God took his leave from the whole world for one day

41:45.790 --> 41:48.544
to cleanse Himself and to be in a holy condition.

41:48.745 --> 41:51.036
Because you see when you clear other people,

41:51.036 --> 41:54.282
when you create something,

41:54.282 --> 41:58.749
then you want to have some time to yourself and to enjoy yourself.

41:58.749 --> 42:01.328
That’s why He got this holiday.

42:01.328 --> 42:07.944
Here it is permanent holiday not holy day, holly means hollow.

42:07.944 --> 42:10.444
It’s hollow day.

42:10.444 --> 42:13.817
And this madness of holiday

42:13.817 --> 42:18.935
is of course I am working out on my level to cut it down.

42:21.348 --> 42:26.214
This is the time one has to really get into Sahaja Yoga,

42:26.214 --> 42:33.286
to work hard, is the time to give up all your lethargies.

42:36.547 --> 42:41.039
You have to get out of your sleep.

42:41.039 --> 42:44.063
I have seen people – I’ve told, she asked Me that,

42:44.063 --> 42:46.466
“Mother we would like to have your puja”. I said, “I know

42:46.466 --> 42:50.919
why you want to have puja is good because puja means flooding.”

42:50.919 --> 42:55.863
The floods come in, ah everybody feels fine.

42:55.863 --> 42:59.879
Some feel fine for a month, some for a week,

42:59.879 --> 43:02.633
some for a day, some for an hour.

43:02.633 --> 43:06.641
Again, as it is.

43:12.355 --> 43:17.584
Because with flooding

43:17.584 --> 43:20.870
you feel the water has come inside.

43:20.870 --> 43:24.798
But it should be needed; there should be some depth.

43:24.798 --> 43:31.060
That is not done. Every Sahaja Yogi must do it every day,

43:31.060 --> 43:34.748
is a part of his life.

43:34.748 --> 43:39.502
Cleansing is a part of his life. Is just like brushing his teeth.

43:39.502 --> 43:44.193
Even if he does not brush his teeth does not matter.

43:44.414 --> 43:49.485
I do not brush My teeth every night. You might have noticed it.

43:49.485 --> 43:54.683
I need not brush. My teeth are still solid and I was asking My husband,

43:54.884 --> 43:58.358
“When do the human beings lose their teeth?”

43:58.358 --> 44:02.930
He said, “You have already passed that age.”

44:02.930 --> 44:06.359
I said, “That means I will never lose My teeth?”

44:06.359 --> 44:09.822
He said, “May not.” But I never brush My teeth in the night

44:09.822 --> 44:14.631
before sleeping as you people religiously do.

44:16.417 --> 44:19.905
The most important thing is cleansing yourself every night.

44:19.905 --> 44:24.858
Whether you cleanse it with water or rub it yourself with salt

44:24.858 --> 44:33.777
or with butter or you do the tratrika, with the flame,

44:33.777 --> 44:35.991
do what you like

44:35.991 --> 44:39.587
but you have to pay attention to your cleansing every night.

44:39.587 --> 44:43.773
And morning time you have to surrender

44:43.773 --> 44:45.972
before doing anything else.

44:45.972 --> 44:51.171
You have to get up early? All right get up early.

44:53.829 --> 44:58.155
Do what you like but you have to work hard.

44:58.718 --> 45:05.244
And you have to think every day what have I done for Sahaja Yoga today?

45:10.244 --> 45:13.631
It’s not the same cycle we are going to start you see.

45:13.631 --> 45:17.877
Once you have denied materialism you became hippies,

45:17.877 --> 45:20.834
now after coming out of that we are not going to start

45:20.834 --> 45:24.925
the same cycle of materialism.

45:28.058 --> 45:32.574
This is a new way where we have to go,

45:32.574 --> 45:36.137
where we understand our detachments from things.

45:36.137 --> 45:39.387
It’s all right.

45:39.387 --> 45:41.832
We are not going to run away from matter

45:41.832 --> 45:45.070
but we are going to master it. If we get it well and good

45:45.271 --> 45:47.578
if we don’t get it well and good, it’s just the same,

45:47.578 --> 45:51.316
makes no difference.

45:54.946 --> 45:58.375
And hard work is needed now, real hard work I tell you

45:58.375 --> 46:00.343
because now I’m going to America.

46:00.343 --> 46:03.113
When I am there, there is so much of lethargy;

46:03.113 --> 46:08.058
when I don’t allow you to sleep after 6 o’clock even if you try.

46:08.058 --> 46:11.042
I’ve done that if you notice,

46:11.042 --> 46:15.964
rather difficult for people to sleep after six.

46:15.964 --> 46:20.852
But, still,

46:20.852 --> 46:23.829
when I go away you have to really work very hard

46:23.829 --> 46:26.423
and keep yourself clean every day

46:26.423 --> 46:29.439
and write it down on a piece of paper.

46:29.439 --> 46:34.106
By the time I come back again I find all my horses.

46:35.098 --> 46:38.576
That’s not going to be this time.

46:38.576 --> 46:41.306
Today you have to promise Me that,

46:41.306 --> 46:44.108
that all of you are going to work very hard,

46:44.108 --> 46:47.716
cleanse yourself completely. Go all out.

46:47.716 --> 46:52.422
After all, this country is not so big to travel.

46:53.367 --> 46:57.913
It makes a big impressive. You have seen Australian Times.

46:57.913 --> 47:03.254
I had only one Sahaja Yogi with me thank God, that was Mr. Regis.

47:03.254 --> 47:07.930
I was only controlling him. Only one horse I had to control

47:07.930 --> 47:11.017
and he was all right. He behaved very well,

47:11.017 --> 47:13.120
otherwise he could have gone off you know.

47:13.120 --> 47:16.509
Anything is possible under the sun.

47:16.509 --> 47:20.491
But he behaved very well. He was quite under control

47:20.491 --> 47:23.311
and they were impressed by his presence there

47:23.311 --> 47:27.450
and they called him serene. Imagine Regis very serene.

47:27.450 --> 47:29.878
And he was very sweet I must say

47:29.878 --> 47:32.926
and he explained to them very well because he is well educated,

47:32.926 --> 47:35.402
he is a doctor.

47:35.402 --> 47:38.938
Today I played a trick on him though, I’m sorry for that.

47:38.938 --> 47:42.576
It was too much, whatever it is,

47:42.576 --> 47:47.263
but he, it worked out and he’s done it well.

47:47.263 --> 47:51.120
In the same way it is you people I have seen it

47:51.120 --> 47:53.217
and said it again and again,

47:53.217 --> 47:57.677
that you are the people who are going to

47:57.677 --> 48:00.487
bring Sahaja Yoga on this earth.

48:00.487 --> 48:06.366
You are the people who are going to do it. I am nothing.

48:10.652 --> 48:17.046
You see now when there is waterfall,

48:17.046 --> 48:21.863
what energy do you see? Nothing, it’s just a waterfall.

48:22.681 --> 48:26.177
But when you put it to turbines

48:26.177 --> 48:29.970
and take out that electricity from the turbines

48:29.970 --> 48:35.700
and then you see them here then you say, "yes there is electricity".

48:39.018 --> 48:44.300
Whatever is potential has no meaning.

48:44.300 --> 48:50.927
Whatever is kinetic, whatever is showing has a meaning.

48:50.927 --> 48:54.866
And so it is for you

48:54.866 --> 48:59.490
to be the showpieces of Sahaja Yoga, not Me.

48:59.490 --> 49:02.053
Because some will say

49:02.053 --> 49:04.701
that, “Oh you may be, so what,

49:04.701 --> 49:07.264
you are a different clan altogether.”

49:07.264 --> 49:12.352
Some may say that,

49:12.352 --> 49:14.684
“Oh we can’t believe you.”

49:14.684 --> 49:18.001
But they will believe you much more they will believe Me.

49:18.001 --> 49:22.811
They will not believe Me at all. They’ll say I’m fantastic.

49:22.811 --> 49:26.442
I, I cannot be understood, you see?

49:26.442 --> 49:29.529
So they won’t believe Me, they will believe you.

49:29.529 --> 49:33.116
They will not trust Me, but they will trust you.

49:33.116 --> 49:35.917
They would not trust Christ but they will trust you

49:35.917 --> 49:40.077
because you are one of them.

49:42.006 --> 49:45.875
That is why it is important that you should improve

49:45.875 --> 49:52.836
in all sincerity, in all truthfulness to yourself.

49:53.598 --> 49:58.717
Become a perfect mechanism of God.

49:58.717 --> 50:01.344
No reservations, should be no reservation.

50:01.344 --> 50:05.589
You see thinking, “All right, if I do this much

50:05.589 --> 50:08.827
then it’s all right, then I come back.”

50:08.827 --> 50:10.907
This is not all out effort.

50:10.907 --> 50:14.907
It seems to be very common you see, ‘cutting corners’ as they say.

50:14.907 --> 50:18.918
“Oh this much, all right, should I do this much

50:18.918 --> 50:21.180
or should I do this much?”

50:21.180 --> 50:24.148
I’ve seen very much discretion is used for all these things.

50:24.148 --> 50:29.640
It’s typical you see, “How many people so how many sandwiches?

50:29.640 --> 50:32.064
They will eat at the most two or three

50:32.064 --> 50:35.775
what’s the use of making more? So but everybody will not eat three

50:35.775 --> 50:40.314
so make it say two is all right, somebody will eat one.”

50:40.314 --> 50:43.314
These calculations, see?

50:44.111 --> 50:47.913
Who will eat one? The one who is calculating should not eat at all,

50:47.913 --> 50:51.409
then that’s the best way.

50:51.409 --> 50:54.648
But it’s all this calculations starts in the mind, you see,

50:54.648 --> 50:58.282
and these calculations ruin you.

51:00.941 --> 51:04.982
It’s a very tricky path. I know it’s very tricky.

51:04.982 --> 51:12.308
But you have beacons before you. Really I tell you, ‘lit’.

51:12.509 --> 51:14.752
Nobody had that.

51:14.752 --> 51:18.593
And you have got the torches in your hand.

51:18.593 --> 51:23.413
And you have a balancing way automatically in built.

51:23.413 --> 51:28.714
Just trust in all those things, and if you walk straight forward,

51:28.714 --> 51:32.954
straight forward, forget all that is past,

51:32.954 --> 51:37.843
all that is nonsensical. Forget it, you are a different person.

51:37.843 --> 51:41.430
I’m sure you’ll rise very fast.

51:42.430 --> 51:47.530
And you will be really a living, organized being.

51:47.530 --> 51:53.040
All of you put together. Living, organized.

51:53.040 --> 51:57.167
These two are not complimentary ever.

51:57.167 --> 52:00.763
Because living is always disorganized,

52:00.834 --> 52:03.104
according to human concept like

52:03.104 --> 52:05.312
they will say that this flower comes out this way t

52:05.312 --> 52:08.548
hat should come out that way. That human being’s thinking

52:08.548 --> 52:12.595
but God thinks that this is the wayit is organized.

52:12.595 --> 52:19.055
So, living organized means organized in the will of God.

52:20.534 --> 52:27.431
That’s how Sahaja Yogi are going to form that nucleus,

52:27.431 --> 52:33.931
that great nucleus, that powerful nucleus,

52:33.931 --> 52:40.074
that tremendous source

52:40.074 --> 52:45.383
which is going to overthrow all that is nonsensical.

52:46.859 --> 52:50.970
It is tremendous, believe Me.

52:52.183 --> 52:56.492
May God bless you
