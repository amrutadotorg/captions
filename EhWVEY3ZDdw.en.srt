1
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,760
Wish you a very very happy Diwali!

2
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,720
To see all of you here

3
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,920
is itself such a joy for Me

4
00:00:48,760 --> 00:00:55,440
that you all have taken to Sahaja Yoga

5
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,600
in such a beautiful way.

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,600
It’s your own,

7
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,880
Self is your own,

8
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,160
Spirit is your own.

9
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:17,000
But ‘to take to Self’ is difficult.

10
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:23,800
It’s only your desires, I think,

11
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:27,200
which is being fulfilled.

12
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,080
And that’s how you have got

13
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:35,080
your Self-Realization.

14
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:39,760
It cannot be forced, as you have known very well.

15
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:45,880
It has to work out only with ‘your’ desire,

16
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:55,280
only with ‘your’ surrendering.

17
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:16,480
No use talking about it,

18
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:25,960
no use convincing about it,

19
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,280
what works out is your desire

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,080
simple as that.

21
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:41,240
The power of desire within you works it out.

22
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:47,320
There are many who are not here,

23
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:53,520
who have got their Realization all over the world.

24
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,840
I remember all of them

25
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:05,000
and all of you should remember them.

26
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,920
Today is a nice day,

27
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,280
when we can think

28
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:18,560
of all those who are enlightened

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,800
in this world.

30
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:25,240
That’s the real Diwali:

31
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:29,960
the enlightenment of human beings.

32
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,240
Is not candle, is not some lamp,

33
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,680
is human beings.

34
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,560
If they are enlightened,

35
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:48,040
then there’s no problem anymore left.

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:52,880
The problems come with the people who are not enlightened.

37
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,960
Because they are in the darkness,

38
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,400
they are groping in the darkness

39
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:02,800
and some of them are don’t know also that

40
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:11,200
they are completely ignorant of realities.

41
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:18,880
Once you come to Sahaja Yog

42
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:23,960
and enlighten your Self,

43
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,840
you ‘see’ in that light,

44
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:35,600
in that light, what’s is good and what is bad

45
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:38,200
to begin with.

46
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,160
And then you grow into it beautifully,

47
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:47,240
just like these flowers,

48
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,040
who are all the time happy,

49
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,760
all the time giving you joy.

50
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:02,960
In the same way, when you are enlightened,

51
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,600
with that light you don’t seek anything.

52
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,280
You got everything, within you.

53
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,440
Keep the lights on.

54
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,640
But the another thing you can do is:

55
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,800
with your light you can enlighten other people

56
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,440
like we have done here,

57
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,080
we had enlightened one candle,

58
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,440
with that we have enlightened all of them.

59
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
So you all can do it, because

60
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:46,040
you have got that light within you.

61
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:51,040
With that light, you can enlighten others

62
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:57,360
and they can feel their joy of their Spirit.

63
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,200
Is something to be seen now,

64
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:08,880
like so many lights you have put.

65
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,800
In the same way, ‘you’ are the lights

66
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:18,960
for the whole world.

67
00:06:19,160 --> 00:06:24,480
Is not sufficient that you have got the light,

68
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:30,280
but also you have to give light to others,

69
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,400
you have to enlighten others, just like these candles.

70
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,000
Once you start doing that,

71
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,080
you will realize what you have got.

72
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:45,080
And then you will respect your Self.

73
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:51,720
And you will behave in a manner that behooves a saint,

74
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,960
could be a sage

75
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:59,440
without proclaiming anything.

76
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:06,760
Inside your being you just develop that beautiful,

77
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:14,800
extremely beautiful temperament that is joy giving.

78
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:23,080
You don’t want to give any false ideas about yourself.

79
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:27,360
Because, whatever is the truth, is with you.

80
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:36,320
There’s no need to tell something untruth about yourself.

81
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:42,240
People will realize that you are realized souls,

82
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:50,880
they will just feel your subtle nature,

83
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:52,440
your reality.

84
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:57,920
Whether you come from India,

85
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:07,240
or you come from England, or from America,

86
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:16,440
you all have that ocean of love and knowledge within you.

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:21,520
Be sure that is all there,

88
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,880
only you first enjoy your own ocean of love.

89
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,600
First you enjoy that

90
00:08:31,760 --> 00:08:35,600
and then you can enjoy in others also.

91
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,080
I don’t have to tell you

92
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,560
that “You love each other” or anything

93
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,960
you just love, you just understand,

94
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:52,240
you just spread your light among yourself.

95
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,120
Sometimes you get frustrated

96
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:59,240
with other people

97
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:02,120
in your country, may be in your city,

98
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,520
may be in your village

99
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,120
that the people who are not yet enlightened.

100
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:14,000
But best thing is to work it out,

101
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,440
you have to work it out.

102
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:21,160
You know, I had first one lady,

103
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,600
very old lady one, who got her Realization from Me.

104
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,720
And then, you all are here.

105
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,040
In the same way you all can also

106
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:38,120
do the job of Realization.

107
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:41,760
For that you don’t need any calculations,

108
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:45,560
you don’t need any thanksgiving

109
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,600
it’s just there and it works out.

110
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,280
What do you do for a light? - just see.

111
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,880
You just put near the candle and you get the light.

112
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:01,480
In the same way it is,

113
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,320
your enlightenment is such

114
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,880
that it will give

115
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:13,080
light to thousands and thousands of people all over the world.

116
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:16,720
As you know, there are many countries

117
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,880
whom we have to still approach.

118
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:22,960
But, we will do that.

119
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,800
Just locate and find out

120
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:28,080
where do you have to go

121
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:32,000
and where you have to work.

122
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:37,520
Firstly, you are capable of giving Realization,

123
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,280
you are.

124
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:41,240
Have confidence,

125
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:44,560
that you can give Realization to people.

126
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,600
For which you don’t need any help,

127
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:54,840
single person can do it, thousands can do it.

128
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:59,640
Is very important for the Diwali of the whole world

129
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:05,040
that we should give Realization to people.

130
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,400
Very important.

131
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:14,720
Now, in Sahaj Yoga, many people are such

132
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:18,480
who are little frustrated with themselves,

133
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,560
specially with their past.

134
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,840
Forget the past!

135
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,720
Past is not important, what is important is present.

136
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,280
At this present moment, what have you to do?

137
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,560
You don’t have to worry about the past,

138
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,680
that “I’ve done this, I’ve done that”

139
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,680
what’s done is finished.

140
00:11:40,840 --> 00:11:45,120
Now you look out for the future.

141
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,280
What can you do for the future.

142
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,960
And some or other, with the light

143
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:55,320
you see your path,

144
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:58,800
you get rid of all the darkness

145
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:02,520
and you know how far to go,

146
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:05,200
how to reach people

147
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,040
and how to spread Sahaj Yog.

148
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,480
It’s something you have already within you,

149
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:16,840
but you have to first of all

150
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,880
establish your connection with it.

151
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:22,240
If you have established your connection

152
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:25,600
with that ocean that you have,

153
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:28,880
you can definitely work it out,

154
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:32,760
work it out in such a beautiful manner

155
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,680
and you’ll be amazed how you’ll be successful.

156
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:43,360
The success that you get out of all this ignorance,

157
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:45,920
you are amazed at it.

158
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,600
But you have the light.

159
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:52,960
With the light you do remove all the darkness.

160
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:54,720
Doesn’t have to think about it,

161
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,800
just removes, because you have the light.

162
00:12:57,960 --> 00:13:01,200
But if you don’t have the light,

163
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,080
then, no use talking about it.

164
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:09,440
No use doing it, because,

165
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:14,280
it doesn’t give any success.

166
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:17,440
On the contrary, it’s a failure,

167
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,800
failure of the worst type.

168
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:24,160
And can be very dangerous for people.

169
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:33,240
We have had very funny experiences also in the Sahaja Yoga.

170
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:38,920
But, I think they all are learning one by one:

171
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,200
that this should not have been done,

172
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:43,560
that was wrong.

173
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:48,920
Now, what blinds you we should find out.

174
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:53,680
In this country, it’s such a money oriented country America is,

175
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:56,640
which has spread all over the world.

176
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:04,360
And being money oriented, you do get enamored,

177
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,000
you do feel that you must make money out of Sahaj Yoga.

178
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,280
There are some who do not think like that,

179
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,720
but they are still running after making money.

180
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:21,640
There is no need at all for you to make money

181
00:14:21,800 --> 00:14:28,600
or to find for yourself a kind of a security in money.

182
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:33,560
Your security is inbuilt within you.

183
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:42,480
So, all these outside things which are absolutely unnecessary

184
00:14:42,640 --> 00:14:46,120
should not blind you.

185
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,000
Now, if you have the light, you can see it clearly.

186
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:53,800
And this help of the Divine,

187
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:57,240
you see that very clearly in your life

188
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,480
and you are surprised

189
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:03,400
how the Divine has helped you at different points.

190
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:07,800
I get letters from people who say:

191
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:10,040
“Mother, thank You very much,

192
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:15,280
I got rid of my problem, I got rid of my enemies”,

193
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:18,520
all kinds of things.

194
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:21,040
While I have done nothing.

195
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:26,200
It’s your light which has removed the darkness.

196
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,680
If you are ignorant,

197
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,160
then only the light can remove the darkness

198
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:34,840
of your ignorance also.

199
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:41,400
Actually, we don’t know how much

200
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:45,120
there is the power of the light.

201
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:47,640
As you can see here,

202
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,640
every light is giving such a lot of,

203
00:15:54,800 --> 00:16:00,680
not only energy, but also complete picture.

204
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:04,800
So thus you can make out,

205
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:10,560
for example you can make out if somebody is a realized soul or not.

206
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,000
Is not necessary

207
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:16,000
that you have to go near that person

208
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:20,840
or take any special care or anything.

209
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:27,040
You will just know that this person is a realized soul or not.

210
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:30,760
I’ve had many such experiences,

211
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:37,720
where I found that people don’t know who is a realized soul,

212
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,280
it’s very surprising.

213
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:45,120
If you know who is a realized soul,

214
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:49,360
then half of your problem is over.

215
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:52,840
Now, the second one is the problem

216
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,720
of how to convince that fellow

217
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,520
what he is capable of doing.

218
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,480
I find that problem also with Sahaja Yogis.

219
00:17:05,080 --> 00:17:11,160
They are capable of very great work

220
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:13,800
all over the world,

221
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:18,160
they can find out so many things,

222
00:17:18,320 --> 00:17:25,360
which normally, normal people cannot find out.

223
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,360
But, Sahaja Yogis can immediately find out

224
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:35,680
what sort of a person they are facing.

225
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,360
This is the difference.

226
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:40,000
That means you know the truth.

227
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,720
Truth about everyone,

228
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:46,880
truth about the whole situation.

229
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,960
Truth about who is just boasting,

230
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,520
or just making up a story,

231
00:17:57,680 --> 00:17:59,760
or some sort of a hypocrisy.

232
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:04,160
It’s not difficult, because now you have the sight.

233
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,280
You can see with your light

234
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:12,320
what’s wrong or what’s good with others.

235
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,600
Such a blessing it is for you,

236
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:19,920
that you cannot be cheated.

237
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:28,400
Because also, you are looked after by the Divine,

238
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:32,040
guided all the time by the Divine.

239
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:34,560
Have faith in the Divine,

240
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:36,880
have faith in the Divine!

241
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,560
That’s very important.

242
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:43,040
As you have faith in a candle,

243
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,720
have faith that the Divine will give you the light,

244
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:51,520
will guide your path,

245
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:55,320
will take you to right place

246
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,600
to do the right things!

247
00:18:57,760 --> 00:19:00,920
I mean so many of these experiences are with you.

248
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:05,760
I need not tell you how much people have written to Me,

249
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,560
how they found things working out.

250
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:16,320
Despite all that, we are collective,

251
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:20,400
we are nice to each other,

252
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:23,840
we don’t tell lies,

253
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:28,640
we don’t try to destroy anyone.

254
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:33,480
That means we are much above all human failings.

255
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:37,280
And this is only because of the light.

256
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:40,960
You can see where you are faltering.

257
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,080
It’s just you see for yourself.

258
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,600
For that, I think,

259
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,520
meditation is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

260
00:19:53,680 --> 00:19:57,080
Everyday you should do meditation.

261
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:00,600
Those who do not do meditation

262
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:04,640
are capable of falling down.

263
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:12,320
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

264
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:16,880
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

265
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:19,400
are sadly mistaken.

266
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:25,880
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

267
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,800
The problem is everything comes so handy,

268
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,120
so simple,

269
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,920
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

270
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:40,560
Many people.

271
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:45,160
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

272
00:20:45,320 --> 00:20:48,480
who don’t meditate.

273
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:55,200
And their style is different,

274
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,280
their nature is different.

275
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,960
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

276
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:09,320
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

277
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:13,440
that all your problems get solved

278
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:16,720
in that meditative mood.

279
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,520
If you are not meditating,

280
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:24,720
you are not following meditation,

281
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,880
then maybe your light will go down,

282
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:31,560
it won’t give sufficient light.

283
00:21:35,320 --> 00:21:38,520
Is important, very important,

284
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,560
to find out about yourself, about others

285
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,720
in the meditation.

286
00:21:47,880 --> 00:21:52,080
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

287
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:54,560
Don’t do anything

288
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,400
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

289
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,320
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

290
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:07,360
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

291
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,800
you’ve done your job.

292
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,400
Because that’s the point where

293
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:17,080
you are with the truth, with the reality,

294
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:18,640
with the joy,

295
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:23,000
with everything that is so fundamental.

296
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:27,200
When you meditate, try not to,

297
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:34,120
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

298
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:38,520
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

299
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:43,720
silencing your thoughts and the going

300
00:22:43,880 --> 00:22:48,120
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

301
00:22:48,280 --> 00:22:52,280
But supposing you don’t do that.

302
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,400
If you don’t meditate,

303
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,080
I can make out immediately

304
00:22:57,240 --> 00:23:00,160
those who are meditating and those who are not

305
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,880
It’s not difficult for Me.

306
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:07,680
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

307
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:13,880
they are confused, they can’t understand.

308
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:17,960
And that’s why meditation

309
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:22,360
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

310
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:26,240
Just like a light burns,

311
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:29,560
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

312
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:33,600
or by, because of the candles,

313
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,160
in the same way meditation

314
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:46,240
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

315
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,560
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

316
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,600
Not only that,

317
00:23:52,760 --> 00:23:57,120
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

318
00:23:57,280 --> 00:24:03,360
it takes out all the discouraging things.

319
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,560
And when you are meditating like that,

320
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,600
thoughtless awareness,

321
00:24:10,760 --> 00:24:15,200
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

322
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:19,520
from within and without.

323
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:22,640
It’s a terrible power that works,

324
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:25,320
this thoughtless awareness.

325
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,800
So those who do not meditate

326
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,560
cannot go very much far

327
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:36,240
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

328
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,560
One should try to meditate

329
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:44,280
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

330
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,280
So, what happens to you?

331
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:51,640
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

332
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:54,320
what happens to you?

333
00:24:54,480 --> 00:25:02,320
Is that you get the confidence,

334
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:07,680
complete confidence of Divinity,

335
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:13,120
you know you have that.

336
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:17,440
I’ve seen children coming from our school in Dharamsala:

337
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:23,640
extremely confident and extremely humble.

338
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,320
And I asked them: “What do you do?”

339
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,920
They said: “Mother, we meditate.

340
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:38,720
We meditate in the school in the evening

341
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,800
and that meditation helps.”

342
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:45,240
Imagine these small children can say that,

343
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,840
so why not you also understand

344
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:52,720
that meditation will give you security,

345
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:56,840
it will give you real enlightenment

346
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:01,800
and a complete connection with the Divine.

347
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:06,320
Without the connection of the Divine,

348
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:10,080
what’s the use of doing Sahaj Yoga?

349
00:26:18,920 --> 00:26:25,880
I know the people who are meditating,

350
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:29,840
who have gone down into their being

351
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,080
and who are very developed.

352
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,400
Also I know people who are little superficial.

353
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:41,360
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

354
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:46,480
Is a very important point which you should reach.

355
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:52,400
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

356
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:56,520
then you really become reflective about it,

357
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:01,720
just works out that way.

358
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:07,160
I don’t know how far you can remain in that condition.

359
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:11,440
But even for a second you can achieve it,

360
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:15,080
you’ll start achieving it more and more.

361
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,440
I’ve talked so much about meditation before,

362
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:24,040
but today when I see all these candles burning,

363
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:27,520
I think they are all meditative,

364
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:30,360
they are all in meditation

365
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,720
and that’s how they are burning.

366
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:39,480
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who meditate, I know,

367
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:42,000
and those who don’t, I know.

368
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,000
And if they have problems,

369
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:47,280
I know why the problems are there.

370
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:50,560
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

371
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,680
is only possible when you meditate

372
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:58,200
and become thoughtlessly aware.

373
00:27:58,360 --> 00:28:04,480
That’s the point where Divine works.

374
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,760
It helps you.

375
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:12,200
It comes to your help in such a way

376
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:17,360
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

377
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:21,800
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

378
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,760
all of you should achieve.

379
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:27,120
Very important.

380
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:32,240
After that you can achieve something else,

381
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:36,320
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

382
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:43,320
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

383
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:46,960
because then there are no thoughts coming

384
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:52,440
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

385
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:57,440
Just in the present you are there.

386
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:01,960
Is something you all have, is not that

387
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:04,280
Me, I’m saying that to you,

388
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,520
but all of you have this.

389
00:29:06,680 --> 00:29:08,480
But ‘steady yourself’!

390
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,160
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

391
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:15,800
How long, that’s not the point.

392
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,520
The point is once you touched it,

393
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,040
you’ll go on touching it.

394
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:28,000
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

395
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:33,560
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

396
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:38,480
Now this is the one point which is very important.

397
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:41,120
If you have to grow,

398
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:44,760
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

399
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:47,280
through thoughtless awareness.

400
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,280
You don’t have to pray,

401
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,880
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

402
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,920
it just works because it is within you.

403
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,240
All these thoughts are bombarding

404
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,320
from both the sides in your mind.

405
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
These thoughts that are coming to you

406
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:05,960
have no meaning with you,

407
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:09,040
they do not substantiate.

408
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:12,360
Yourself you are an ocean

409
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:18,960
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

410
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:24,080
It is always described in all the great books,

411
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,800
but not so clearly as I am telling you.

412
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:32,320
I don’t say that some of you do not get thoughtless awareness,

413
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,600
so they are good for nothing, no.

414
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,080
But, please try, you can all get into that state

415
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,120
of thoughtless awareness.

416
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:45,440
Even for a second if you get it,

417
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,480
it’s a very good idea.

418
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:53,320
Then you go on increasing that second.

419
00:30:54,600 --> 00:31:01,000
I think is a reflecting mind.

420
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,560
When you look at something,

421
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:09,920
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

422
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:15,680
And then this mind reflects

423
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:21,560
to the depth of what you see.

424
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,720
That’s how you all will become really

425
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,960
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

426
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:36,800
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

427
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,120
is not established by many, which is not good.

428
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:45,000
Today on this day of Diwali, I would say that:

429
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,520
“You enlighten your Self with thoughtless awareness!”

430
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:54,040
It is not difficult, is within you.

431
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:58,080
Because thoughts are coming from this side and that side.

432
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,760
And they are not the waves of your brain, no,

433
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:05,520
just your own reactions.

434
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:12,680
But, in case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

435
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:16,360
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

436
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,880
Which is a very important point

437
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:23,360
and all these nonsensical thoughts,

438
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,760
which are of no use to you, will disappear.

439
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:34,480
They won’t be there and then your growth is possible

440
00:32:34,640 --> 00:32:37,920
and you’ll grow very well.

441
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:41,240
Many people are here, who will say:

442
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:43,640
“Mother, we don’t get that state.”

443
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,960
Try,

444
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,960
try that!

445
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:51,360
I don’t believe you cannot get it.

446
00:32:51,520 --> 00:32:55,200
All of you can get that thought

447
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:58,720
that “I can get it”, and you will get it.

448
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:06,640
In that you don’t have to discard anything,

449
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:13,680
you don’t have to see anything, just go into meditation

450
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,800
and you’ll be amazed how it will work.

451
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:21,560
Of course you are very much there, most of you,

452
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,200
but still, I would say,

453
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:31,320
increase that thoughtless awareness, that area!

454
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:37,560
Today is very important because of this day of Diwali.

455
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:43,240
Diwali is supposed to be enlightenment day.

456
00:33:43,400 --> 00:33:48,360
But enlightenment within is:

457
00:33:48,520 --> 00:33:52,920
how much you are in thoughtless awareness?

458
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,440
And the everything works out,

459
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,480
because you are the ocean of it,

460
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:02,040
you have it within yourself.

461
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,800
Only you have to tap it.

462
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,560
If you don’t tap it,

463
00:34:07,720 --> 00:34:10,680
then it doesn’t work out.

464
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,280
You have to just tap it

465
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:18,960
and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,

466
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:24,520
source of such happiness,

467
00:34:24,680 --> 00:34:29,280
I should say, source of real enlightenment.

468
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,960
So, today’s message is that:

469
00:34:33,160 --> 00:34:38,720
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

470
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,320
No thought is important,

471
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:45,640
because it’s your own creation.

472
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:50,160
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

473
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:54,560
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

474
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:57,240
minimum of minimum.

475
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:00,920
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

476
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:03,920
and you’ll be amazed how

477
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:09,120
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

478
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,920
Thank you very much!
