00:00:04.734 --> 00:00:11.734
Today, we are going to worship the Goddess.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.400
That’s the, first the left side programming is with Her,

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:25.400
but later on, at Sahasrara, She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:31.367
And, on the left side, whatever She does
is already written, as you must have seen,

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:34.367
because She’s the memory

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:43.234
and that She’s the wisdom and,

00:00:47.534 --> 00:01:01.634
that She protects you, is shown when
She uses Her power over the Ganas.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:12.601
There are Ganas that are, as we know, responsible

00:01:12.701 --> 00:01:17.300
for all kinds of corrections in you.

00:01:20.767 --> 00:01:32.467
These are the Ganas which act through the left side.

00:01:32.567 --> 00:01:39.734
As we know very well that cancer is
caused by the problems of the Left side.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:52.534
And, on the left side are these Ganas, which
are completely in unison with the Devi’s powers.

00:01:52.701 --> 00:01:54.367
She doesn’t have to

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.367
tell them, She doesn’t have to guide
them, they are already built up like that.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:06.033
And these Ganas are the ones which, I should say, target,

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:12.234
they target the diseases and cure you.

00:02:16.434 --> 00:02:24.734
We have cured many cancer patients and
many left-sided people through the Ganas.

00:02:26.767 --> 00:02:31.033
But Ganas won’t listen to anybody else.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:38.000
And Ganapati is their leader, I
should say, their controlling power.

00:02:40.434 --> 00:02:49.434
So, if your Ganapati is alright then problems are less,

00:02:49.534 --> 00:02:57.667
but if the Ganapati is not alright,
then all kinds of problems can come up

00:02:57.767 --> 00:03:02.300
and they can torture you.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.300
This is one of the things I am so particular about,

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.033
that we must get our Ganeshas corrected.

00:03:11.133 --> 00:03:16.067
The other day I received a big envelope with letters saying that,

00:03:16.167 --> 00:03:19.767
“Mother, difficult to control Ganas,”

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:24.434
but [it’s] difficult to control Ganapati Himself!

00:03:24.534 --> 00:03:30.000
So, what should we do? We’ll get into traumas!

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.801
A simple thing is, at such a point when you are in a trauma,

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:45.567
and when you cannot overcome this defect of the Ganapati,

00:03:45.667 --> 00:03:50.167
then what you should do is to meditate.

00:03:50.267 --> 00:03:56.501
Meditation is the only way you can overcome Ganas.

00:03:56.601 --> 00:04:02.567
The first of all is the upbringing of the children

00:04:02.667 --> 00:04:08.200
and then the atmosphere as it exists.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:15.267
With these two important factors,

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:18.434
you can do well with the Ganas.

00:04:18.534 --> 00:04:24.133
But the problem is that human beings get lost,

00:04:24.234 --> 00:04:29.167
and they don’t look after their Ganapati.

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:35.300
So, as you worship the Goddess,
you are also worshipping Shri Ganesha

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:39.434
who is the power behind Her.

00:04:41.467 --> 00:04:50.534
But the greatest power that is
belonging to the Mother is your protection,

00:04:50.634 --> 00:04:54.400
protection from all kinds of things.

00:04:54.501 --> 00:04:59.534
All the left hand side protections are there.

00:04:59.634 --> 00:05:03.434
They are described, as you must have learned,

00:05:03.534 --> 00:05:08.234
in the Devi Mahatmyam, what a protections She gives you.

00:05:08.334 --> 00:05:12.434
So tremendous in Her protecting power,

00:05:12.534 --> 00:05:19.300
and this protecting power gives you understanding:

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:25.000
how kind She is and how,

00:05:30.767 --> 00:05:39.133
I should say, how very, very
protective of you, extremely protective.

00:05:39.234 --> 00:05:46.133
She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected,

00:05:46.234 --> 00:05:54.434
on the left side, and through Her Ganas She looks after you.

00:05:54.534 --> 00:06:00.767
But on the right side also, those who are on the right side,

00:06:01.033 --> 00:06:07.701
the Goddess puts Her powers to put you right,

00:06:07.801 --> 00:06:12.033
to bring you back to normal conditions,

00:06:12.133 --> 00:06:19.601
to humble you down and make you understand that

00:06:19.701 --> 00:06:27.667
you are a child of the Mother
and you have to behave like a child.

00:06:29.701 --> 00:06:33.300
But, if you go to extremes,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:35.033
then you develop all

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:40.000
kinds of complications of the right
side also, as you develop on the left side.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:44.467
And the right side problems these days are very, very common,

00:06:44.567 --> 00:06:49.267
which I have seen people cannot get over.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:56.234
So many diseases like Alzheimer
and other diseases come up, later on.

00:06:56.334 --> 00:07:00.400
First it starts with the liver.

00:07:00.501 --> 00:07:09.601
The liver is the main point, as
we fall into the trap of the liver.

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:17.701
If you are thinking too much, if you
are futuristic, if you are aggressive,

00:07:17.801 --> 00:07:21.167
then the liver goes out

00:07:21.267 --> 00:07:25.200
because you use liver’s power to do all that.

00:07:25.300 --> 00:07:30.601
And when your liver power is over,
you are finished with liver power,

00:07:30.701 --> 00:07:34.000
you can develop so many diseases,

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:39.767
so many troubles that you
cannot overcome it, it’s very difficult.

00:07:40.033 --> 00:07:46.167
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, so many
people’s liver has been cured; so many people.

00:07:46.267 --> 00:07:53.467
And it has been doing wonderful
work as far as the liver is concerned,

00:07:53.567 --> 00:08:00.300
but one should humble down and try to keep the liver alright.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:05.100
So the protection is also built-in your body

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:15.467
by Ganas on the left hand side and
by reactions on the right hand side.

00:08:15.567 --> 00:08:20.501
But the greatest thing is the blessings of the Mother:

00:08:20.601 --> 00:08:25.400
the way She looks after you, the way She loves you

00:08:25.501 --> 00:08:30.400
and the way She cares for you – which
you should never take it for granted!

00:08:30.501 --> 00:08:37.200
You must meditate, you must meditate, it’s very important.

00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:42.734
No question! Without meditation
you can[not] keep yourself alright.

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:45.701
it’s no question.

00:08:45.801 --> 00:08:51.801
Meditation is the most important thing which must be followed

00:08:52.067 --> 00:08:56.300
because that’s how you come close to Her vibrations,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:09:02.501
come to Her – I should say to Her nature.

00:09:02.601 --> 00:09:08.167
Even animals are so sensitive to
Mother, very sensitive to vibrations.

00:09:08.267 --> 00:09:12.801
Animals are, but human beings have their own understanding,

00:09:13.067 --> 00:09:20.400
have their own freedom, have their so-called intelligence

00:09:20.501 --> 00:09:28.334
and they fall a trap to it; they follow
things which they should not have.

00:09:28.434 --> 00:09:33.167
So what is necessary very much, in the country like America,

00:09:33.267 --> 00:09:37.367
is the devotion and bhakti.

00:09:37.467 --> 00:09:40.033
These two things are not there.

00:09:40.133 --> 00:09:43.801
Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down into it

00:09:44.067 --> 00:09:47.701
because they know what is bhakti, what is devotion.

00:09:47.801 --> 00:09:51.367
All this ego and all that melts away.

00:09:51.467 --> 00:09:54.467
But this bhakti is to be enjoyed.

00:09:54.567 --> 00:10:00.133
I don’t know how to create bhakti within you – that I can’t say.

00:10:00.234 --> 00:10:04.400
But I have seen people with bhakti,

00:10:04.501 --> 00:10:09.467
they have achieved great heights,
though it’s a left side movement.

00:10:09.567 --> 00:10:13.567
With the left side movement they have achieved great heights.

00:10:13.667 --> 00:10:20.133
I don’t know how the bhakti (devotion) and
shraddha (faith) has helped them so much.

00:10:20.234 --> 00:10:25.400
In this, I must say, Indians are the best

00:10:25.501 --> 00:10:32.033
because they have this power of bhakti and of shraddha.

00:10:32.133 --> 00:10:36.200
It’s not madness, it’s not madness as they have here:

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:42.133
I have seen people who get into some
sort of a cult or something, they go mad.

00:10:42.234 --> 00:10:48.601
It’s not madness, bhakti is love,
and love which is understanding,

00:10:48.701 --> 00:10:53.701
which understands what is bhakti and shraddha.

00:10:53.801 --> 00:10:58.200
Unless and until you develop that bhakti and shraddha within you,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:05.100
you cannot rise, you cannot rise above your problems,

00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.100
you cannot rise above your personality because

00:11:14.634 --> 00:11:23.200
bhakti is something you cannot impose
on anyone, you cannot force on anybody.

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:31.267
You can make somebody mad and
say that he can do bhakti, [but] he cannot.

00:11:31.367 --> 00:11:39.133
You have to have all your qualities absolutely intact:

00:11:39.234 --> 00:11:44.667
you should be intelligent, you should be
understanding – everything should be there,

00:11:44.767 --> 00:11:50.400
but at that time the joy of bhakti is within you.

00:11:50.501 --> 00:11:55.033
And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing,

00:11:55.133 --> 00:12:00.667
the Goddess Herself enters into your being, I should say.

00:12:00.767 --> 00:12:05.367
I have seen people, bhaktas, many great saints in India

00:12:05.467 --> 00:12:11.000
who achieved a lot of height. They’ve gone too far into it.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:17.767
And if you read about them and, if you understand them,

00:12:18.033 --> 00:12:23.801
you are amazed how, without any help, without any guidance,

00:12:24.067 --> 00:12:29.334
how could they go that deep and worship Devi.

00:12:29.434 --> 00:12:34.133
Worshipping is not just out of sheer reading

00:12:34.234 --> 00:12:37.567
or some sort of a chanting or anything,

00:12:37.667 --> 00:12:45.734
but it’s the deep attention of your heart;

00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:48.334
I think it’s Spirit.

00:12:48.434 --> 00:12:52.400
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you develop the bhakti

00:12:52.501 --> 00:12:55.434
and drop out all nonsensical ideas,

00:12:55.534 --> 00:12:59.601
all different things that have crawled into your head,

00:12:59.701 --> 00:13:02.567
but you just develop the bhakti.

00:13:02.667 --> 00:13:07.367
Now all these qualities described,
of the Devi [that] are left sided, are in

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.033
the brain:

00:13:09.133 --> 00:13:13.501
memory, ‘smruti rupena sansthita’.

00:13:13.601 --> 00:13:17.667
Other things also – whatever are described – are in the brain.

00:13:17.767 --> 00:13:24.467
And then the bhakti reaches the stage
[where] it just neutralises everything.

00:13:24.567 --> 00:13:31.000
All the problems of the brain are
neutralised and you become a wise person.

00:13:31.100 --> 00:13:37.033
So the greatest boon of the Devi is to give you wisdom.

00:13:37.133 --> 00:13:44.267
You can call it awareness, you can call it
anything but it’s a kind of a wisdom by which

00:13:44.367 --> 00:13:50.100
you become absolutely a Divine personality.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.667
That wisdom you must reach through your bhakti.

00:13:53.767 --> 00:13:57.434
But, you see, we have people of all kinds:

00:13:57.534 --> 00:14:03.567
some are very much in the
shraddha, in the bhakti, in the devotion

00:14:03.667 --> 00:14:08.133
but they are wrongly placed and they don’t understand

00:14:08.234 --> 00:14:12.634
to whom we should worship and where we should go.

00:14:12.734 --> 00:14:17.100
Now Sahaja Yoga is a actualisation,

00:14:17.200 --> 00:14:21.601
Sahaja Yoga is a Sakshat, is actualisation,

00:14:21.701 --> 00:14:27.467
in which you know whom to worship and whom to surrender,

00:14:27.567 --> 00:14:30.334
it’s not blind, in any way.

00:14:30.434 --> 00:14:34.667
Whatever is blind bhakti can take you to any kind of nonsense

00:14:34.767 --> 00:14:39.033
and that’s how many cults have come
up, many [of] these things have come up,

00:14:39.133 --> 00:14:48.267
but that’s not a thing that sees, that knows, that understands.

00:14:48.367 --> 00:14:51.601
It should be understood by your intelligence,

00:14:51.701 --> 00:14:58.067
by all your qualities – what is your bhakti is like.

00:14:58.167 --> 00:15:04.234
Now we have, through Kundalini awakening,
reached a very great height I must say

00:15:04.334 --> 00:15:10.501
of understanding of bhakti, the power of bhakti .

00:15:10.601 --> 00:15:18.801
The greatest power of bhakti is
that it protects you, it protects you.

00:15:19.067 --> 00:15:27.567
Those people who are suffering from
any kind of trouble, any kind of problems,

00:15:27.667 --> 00:15:34.000
just get out of it because this bhakti of yours

00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:41.667
gives you the right type of understanding,
the understanding of your Self;

00:15:41.767 --> 00:15:47.467
also the understanding of surroundings,
understanding of the whole Universe,

00:15:47.501 --> 00:15:49.434
I should say,

00:15:49.534 --> 00:15:52.634
why people behave like this, why they are like this,

00:15:52.734 --> 00:15:57.300
all this can be solved through your bhakti.

00:15:57.400 --> 00:16:02.667
It should not be blind, it should not
be blind, but it should be wise bhakti,

00:16:02.701 --> 00:16:04.534
wise with wisdom.

00:16:04.634 --> 00:16:07.234
Only possible through Sahaja Yoga, I think,

00:16:07.334 --> 00:16:11.734
otherwise, whatever bhakti people
do like mad, that cannot be bhakti.

00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:16.234
You don’t become mad, you become a wise man,

00:16:16.334 --> 00:16:23.267
wise man as we had so many in the past.

00:16:23.367 --> 00:16:28.767
And the way they have talked about everything is surprising.

00:16:29.033 --> 00:16:34.567
How they have said things about human awareness,

00:16:34.667 --> 00:16:38.501
about your ascent is remarkable

00:16:38.601 --> 00:16:43.467
and sometimes I feel that they
have really prepared a field for me,

00:16:43.567 --> 00:16:48.634
a proper area for me, to talk to people.

00:16:48.734 --> 00:16:54.434
Especially in India, I don’t know why, traditionally

00:16:54.534 --> 00:17:00.534
we are very, traditionally we are very much devoted people.

00:17:00.634 --> 00:17:03.801
In the same way all over it should happen.

00:17:04.067 --> 00:17:08.701
Because, in India of course there are mad people also,

00:17:08.801 --> 00:17:12.334
there are cults, there are all kinds of things, no doubt,

00:17:12.434 --> 00:17:18.000
but actually there we have saints who have guided us very well.

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:22.300
Despite that you find in India people are going astray,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:26.767
doing wrong things and wrong type of worshipping.

00:17:27.033 --> 00:17:29.534
This is true, no doubt,

00:17:29.634 --> 00:17:41.434
but it is I should say just a funny type
of a madness, where there is no wisdom.

00:17:41.534 --> 00:17:48.234
What is [the difference] between a mad and a
sane person is, that a mad person has no wisdom.

00:17:48.334 --> 00:17:50.801
And those who have also so-called wisdom,

00:17:51.067 --> 00:17:55.567
or so they say, that “we are very wise,” are sadly mistaken.

00:17:55.667 --> 00:18:00.200
Because the way they behave, the way they commit mistakes,

00:18:00.300 --> 00:18:07.601
the way their whole attention is, I
should say the whole working is,

00:18:07.701 --> 00:18:12.567
is sometimes surprising but [it’s] because they have no wisdom.

00:18:12.701 --> 00:18:19.234
First of all is, to test yourself you must see, “Am I wise?

00:18:19.334 --> 00:18:24.801
Am I wise? Do I do wise things or I’m not doing?”

00:18:25.067 --> 00:18:29.200
So many complaints come to me, about Sahaja Yogis also.

00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:32.701
I am surprised, why: why are they doing like that?

00:18:32.801 --> 00:18:37.434
I would say, still, they have not reached the state of bhakti.

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:43.601
Bhakti and shraddha, these two things
are missing in the Western life, I must say.

00:18:43.701 --> 00:18:48.100
We should come back, we should develop, we should grow.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:52.167
But, even in the Eastern life now it’s missing.

00:18:52.267 --> 00:18:55.367
For them the ideal is now the Western life.

00:18:55.467 --> 00:19:05.501
Once you take to Western life, that part is
over because the whole thing is judged with ideas:

00:19:05.601 --> 00:19:13.634
what is beneficial, what is helpful in life.

00:19:13.734 --> 00:19:21.434
But bhakti and shraddha, according
to them, is of no use, that doesn’t help.

00:19:21.534 --> 00:19:24.567
Most of the people nowadays think like that

00:19:24.667 --> 00:19:31.167
but you are very few who have understood
what is bhakti and what is shraddha.

00:19:31.267 --> 00:19:35.801
So, I would say, the Goddess gives you bhakti and shraddha.

00:19:36.067 --> 00:19:38.067
By what?

00:19:38.167 --> 00:19:42.167
She gives you through your meditation;

00:19:42.267 --> 00:19:46.801
that you see so many miracles
happening in your life and you are amazed.

00:19:47.067 --> 00:19:51.467
“How this has happened? We never expected this to happen.

00:19:51.567 --> 00:19:55.200
How it has happened, how it has worked out?”

00:19:55.300 --> 00:20:01.167
Also She corrects you. All the time, if you are aware,

00:20:01.267 --> 00:20:06.400
She corrects you and tells you, “Don’t go
this way! You are going on the ego side.”

00:20:06.501 --> 00:20:09.501
Or She’ll tell you, “You are going on the left side.”

00:20:09.601 --> 00:20:12.300
She’s the one who corrects, throughout.

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:17.667
We get into diseases and we are trapped into all kinds of things;

00:20:17.767 --> 00:20:23.200
it is because we don’t have bhakti.

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.133
In the bhakti, you have to depend on the wisdom of the Mother,

00:20:28.234 --> 00:20:32.701
wisdom of the Shakti, that She looks after you,

00:20:32.801 --> 00:20:37.133
She finds you out the way and She will help you.

00:20:37.234 --> 00:20:40.133
If you start becoming on your own

00:20:40.234 --> 00:20:44.467
and thinking that, “I am alright, I
can do this, I can do that,” you will find

00:20:44.567 --> 00:20:48.200
inevitably that you are wrong,

00:20:48.300 --> 00:20:54.300
that you had a very wrong idea
about yourself and about the Divine.

00:20:54.400 --> 00:21:01.467
So, what is the most important point is
surrendering. The word ‘Islam’ means surrender.

00:21:01.567 --> 00:21:08.467
But Mohammed Sahib has described what you
should have before surrender is your Realisation.

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:15.234
But, you have seen, even after
Realisation people take time to settle down.

00:21:15.334 --> 00:21:16.467
But once you

00:21:16.501 --> 00:21:20.167
are settled down you understand that
you are under a protection of the Goddess,

00:21:20.267 --> 00:21:26.067
that you see every day how it works and how it helps you.

00:21:26.167 --> 00:21:32.534
Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga,
so-called, have great respect for me

00:21:32.634 --> 00:21:36.667
but are not fully there; then they suffer

00:21:36.767 --> 00:21:39.300
and they have problems and then they ask me,

00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:42.667
“Mother, how is it I have got this problem?” I don’t tell them,

00:21:42.767 --> 00:21:47.133
because you can’t tell anything to human
beings, you see, they are very aggressive.

00:21:47.234 --> 00:21:56.801
But, the fact is because you are not one with the Divine.

00:21:57.067 --> 00:22:02.200
And with the Divine if you are one, you’ll
have nothing but compassion and love,

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:03.801
nothing else.

00:22:04.067 --> 00:22:07.467
And everything you will do so smoothly, so nicely.

00:22:07.567 --> 00:22:09.067
People may not

00:22:09.133 --> 00:22:13.434
understand, like they crucified Christ,
they did all kind of things -agreed.

00:22:13.534 --> 00:22:18.767
But now, you should ask for the protection of the Goddess

00:22:19.033 --> 00:22:23.634
because that is the greatest quality
of the Goddess, that She protects you

00:22:23.734 --> 00:22:31.701
from all problems, from all
troubles, from all kinds of nonsensical

00:22:31.801 --> 00:22:35.567
I should say things that can happen to you.

00:22:35.667 --> 00:22:38.734
And there are so many things that happen.

00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:44.534
I tell you, I was told that one of the
leaders of Sahaja Yogi was killed.

00:22:44.634 --> 00:22:53.567
I said, “Not possible!” And the
fellow was in Rome, he was not killed.

00:22:53.667 --> 00:22:58.367
So, it’s not possible that a young
man should be killed like that.

00:22:58.467 --> 00:23:00.767
Of course, if somebody is old you have to die,

00:23:01.033 --> 00:23:04.267
but that he was killed, was not a right thing.

00:23:04.367 --> 00:23:09.033
So it is the protection, not only physical, mental, emotional,

00:23:09.133 --> 00:23:11.534
but spiritual protection comes to you.

00:23:11.634 --> 00:23:17.133
Spiritual protection in that what you
do is that you don’t do wrong things.

00:23:17.234 --> 00:23:22.434
You don’t kill anybody, you don’t torture
anybody, you are not rude to anybody.

00:23:22.534 --> 00:23:29.567
That is the situation into which you all
can enter because you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:23:29.667 --> 00:23:33.501
You can achieve it. You have a power to do it

00:23:33.601 --> 00:23:40.133
because you have so much shraddha and so much understanding

00:23:40.234 --> 00:23:47.534
that you have reached a certain
state of protection, of growth of wisdom.

00:23:47.634 --> 00:23:52.133
Now first test your wisdom, you must test your wisdom,

00:23:52.234 --> 00:23:57.634
“If I am doing this, is this wise,
is it good, why I am doing it?”

00:23:57.734 --> 00:24:02.434
First test your wisdom, then you’ll
find out that many things you do

00:24:02.534 --> 00:24:06.000
which are wrong, which should not have been done.

00:24:06.100 --> 00:24:13.167
But first your wisdom must develop and you
must see that your wisdom works and helps you.

00:24:13.267 --> 00:24:17.133
I have seen now, yesterday’s drama, you must have seen that girl

00:24:17.234 --> 00:24:23.100
she is very sensitive and she could
see through her wisdom what was good.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:27.534
If you cannot find out what is good and what is bad

00:24:27.634 --> 00:24:31.067
that means the wisdom is lacking.

00:24:31.167 --> 00:24:37.367
If you cannot find out what should
you do then the wisdom is lacking.

00:24:37.467 --> 00:24:45.367
But, if you have the wisdom, then you
will immediately know that this is wrong.

00:24:45.467 --> 00:24:50.267
Apart from that, you’ll be saved from all kinds of problems.

00:24:50.367 --> 00:24:55.667
It’s a fact, I have seen with so many
people like that, who have been saved,

00:24:55.767 --> 00:25:02.434
not only from death, but from all
kinds of catastrophes, all kinds.

00:25:02.534 --> 00:25:08.667
And I was amazed how these Sahaja Yogis are helped by the Divine.

00:25:08.767 --> 00:25:14.334
Divine is a power, everywhere it exists.

00:25:14.434 --> 00:25:19.701
But it will only help the people
who are Sahaj Yogis, who are divine,

00:25:19.801 --> 00:25:23.701
not the people who are not, it will never help you,

00:25:23.801 --> 00:25:29.801
on the contrary it might punish in a way that is never expected.

00:25:30.067 --> 00:25:36.267
So, one has to be careful to test
oneself, what I call ‘introspection’:

00:25:36.367 --> 00:25:40.367
Have you been wise in dealing with certain problems?

00:25:40.467 --> 00:25:42.434
What has been your style?

00:25:42.534 --> 00:25:46.667
Is it money oriented or it is domination oriented.

00:25:46.767 --> 00:25:52.033
What sort of a power it was that you were working under?

00:25:52.133 --> 00:25:54.801
You have to introspect to find out.

00:25:55.067 --> 00:25:58.434
And you will be amazed, very much amazed,

00:25:58.534 --> 00:26:03.234
that even in the name of God you can do wrong things.

00:26:03.334 --> 00:26:06.767
Lots of wrong things have been
done in the name of God and that’s why

00:26:07.033 --> 00:26:11.200
today we have such a big chaos of so called ‘religions’,

00:26:11.300 --> 00:26:15.000
when nothing wrong was religion, was with the religion as such,

00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:18.601
and those religious people who talked about it – nothing wrong –

00:26:18.701 --> 00:26:23.100
but the way people absorbed it and
the way people used it was wrong.

00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.067
Because [what] they lacked is wisdom.

00:26:26.167 --> 00:26:31.267
And the wisdom is the thing which really is not just assumption

00:26:31.367 --> 00:26:33.367
that, “I am very wise and all that,”

00:26:33.501 --> 00:26:40.367
but it asserts, it works out and it
shows what is good and what is bad.

00:26:40.467 --> 00:26:48.667
Wisdom is the sign of a person who is
really a realised soul of a very high level.

00:26:48.767 --> 00:26:53.267
If you don’t have wisdom whatever you may do,

00:26:53.367 --> 00:26:59.033
you might feel satisfied about it, but
the wisdom part is very, very important.

00:26:59.133 --> 00:27:03.501
That is the most governing part within us and as you know,

00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:09.467
Ganesha is the giver of wisdom.

00:27:09.567 --> 00:27:14.200
That’s why Ganesha must be worshipped.

00:27:26.167 --> 00:27:29.767
With a proper upbringing

00:27:33.133 --> 00:27:40.467
Shri Ganesha is established, who
is nothing but the giver of wisdom.

00:27:44.133 --> 00:27:50.234
And this wisdom is innate. You don’t have to judge it,

00:27:50.334 --> 00:27:56.367
it’s innate within us, grown up,
just like any other qualities in us.

00:27:56.467 --> 00:28:02.801
It takes time with some people, it takes time, no doubt.

00:28:03.801 --> 00:28:16.300
But once it comes in, such a person
becomes quiet, simple and absolutely truthful.

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:20.667
He knows about everything.

00:28:20.767 --> 00:28:27.200
And this is the thing one should develop is, “How far am I wise?”

00:28:27.300 --> 00:28:31.367
You see, in this world people are
protesting for this, protesting for that,

00:28:31.467 --> 00:28:36.067
fighting for this, doing all kinds of things.

00:28:36.167 --> 00:28:42.167
But if you have wisdom, then you
don’t have to do anything of the kind!

00:28:42.267 --> 00:28:49.267
What happens is that automatically
people understand that he’s a wise man.

00:28:49.367 --> 00:28:54.033
From ancient times everywhere a wise man has been praised.

00:28:54.133 --> 00:29:00.400
He’s not worried about his financial
side, or emotional side, nothing!

00:29:00.501 --> 00:29:05.767
What he is worried is, “Have I been a wise person?”

00:29:06.033 --> 00:29:10.334
That is the first sign of the blessings of God.

00:29:10.434 --> 00:29:16.133
The one who has blessings of Divine is a wise person,

00:29:16.234 --> 00:29:21.133
he’s very wise and his wisdom is shown by his silence.

00:29:21.234 --> 00:29:25.467
And the Whole Power, the Divine Power,

00:29:25.567 --> 00:29:31.667
uses that person as a media and works tremendously.

00:29:31.767 --> 00:29:36.634
That man himself is surprised how it has helped him.

00:29:36.734 --> 00:29:39.801
A woman can have that, a man can have it,

00:29:40.067 --> 00:29:45.701
anybody can have that wisdom, that profoundness, that temperament

00:29:45.801 --> 00:29:54.133
which is so beautiful and so empowering.

00:29:54.234 --> 00:29:56.434
Such

00:29:56.467 --> 00:30:03.300
a person doesn’t curse anyone, doesn’t
bother to curse anyone, but it works.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:08.334
He never gets angry with anyone, but it works.

00:30:10.634 --> 00:30:17.434
He doesn’t lose temper, no, but some temper works

00:30:17.534 --> 00:30:23.100
and harms you which you never expected.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:30.267
It is within us, within our power as human beings, to be wise.

00:30:30.367 --> 00:30:36.367
I have seen animals have such a
sensitivity to vibrations, extremely sensitive.

00:30:36.467 --> 00:30:40.601
How? Because their wisdom is intact.

00:30:40.701 --> 00:30:44.100
It works in them, they are not conscious of it.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:52.200
The difference is, human beings are conscious
of their wisdom, that’s the only difference.

00:30:52.300 --> 00:30:56.534
Animals have wisdom, but automatic, we should say, natural.

00:30:56.634 --> 00:31:05.467
But we have inculcated this, or we have
developed this wisdom within us, through what?

00:31:05.567 --> 00:31:13.434
Through our meditation, through our
understanding of bhakti and shraddha.

00:31:13.534 --> 00:31:21.467
So it’s very important to understand
the value of bhakti within us.

00:31:21.567 --> 00:31:28.334
You cannot superficially touch it.
Those who are superficial will never get it.

00:31:28.434 --> 00:31:39.300
Wisdom only comes through understanding what is wisdom is.

00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:42.334
You might find somebody extremely wise,

00:31:42.434 --> 00:31:46.634
he may be your servant, may be your driver, may be anyone.

00:31:46.734 --> 00:31:51.634
And you are amazed how such a person can be so wise.

00:31:51.734 --> 00:31:57.067
Because, maybe from his last life, he has got it within him,

00:31:57.167 --> 00:32:01.167
or he has gone into it and he found it.

00:32:02.734 --> 00:32:08.367
It’s not the estate of one person,
it’s not the property of one person

00:32:08.467 --> 00:32:11.734
but it can belong to many of them.

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:17.000
So the Sahaj Yogi is the one who has to have that wisdom,

00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.067
“Why I am doing this? What is the need to do it?”

00:32:20.167 --> 00:32:24.334
They don’t have to ask any questions,
they just don’t do wrong things.

00:32:24.434 --> 00:32:27.167
They just don’t do wrong things.

00:32:27.267 --> 00:32:29.634
They are always on the right path.

00:32:29.734 --> 00:32:36.367
That is the sign of a Sahaj Yogi, I believe,
and which is the blessing of the Goddess.

00:32:36.467 --> 00:32:40.267
If there is the Power of the Goddess working in you,

00:32:40.367 --> 00:32:43.601
you will have the wisdom to work it out.

00:32:43.701 --> 00:32:48.567
Now you have seen many people
coming to America, doing all kinds of things.

00:32:48.667 --> 00:32:51.767
They all have disappeared. There’s no support to them.

00:32:52.033 --> 00:32:54.234
Where are they? They are finished.

00:32:54.334 --> 00:32:59.400
Because they were money oriented, or power
oriented, I don’t know what they were oriented!

00:32:59.501 --> 00:33:01.400
And they have lost it.

00:33:01.501 --> 00:33:07.534
But for a person who is standing in his wisdom,

00:33:07.634 --> 00:33:12.167
is the sage as they call him, is the saint as they call it.

00:33:12.267 --> 00:33:17.667
But, this can be every Sahaja Yogi could be a saint,

00:33:17.767 --> 00:33:22.033
could be a sage, every Sahaja Yogi could be that.

00:33:22.133 --> 00:33:27.300
But if you lose your wisdom then you are no good.

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:33.534
So, I have to tell you one thing:
it’s your wisdom which will save you.

00:33:33.634 --> 00:33:40.000
Your wisdom will unconsciously help you.

00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:46.501
There was one gentleman, Sahaj Yogi,
once he was going somewhere in the car

00:33:46.601 --> 00:33:52.267
and suddenly decided to go on to another road, suddenly.

00:33:52.367 --> 00:33:56.234
And what happened, that on that
road there was a very big accident

00:33:56.334 --> 00:33:59.367
and he would have been in that accident.

00:33:59.467 --> 00:34:03.133
Like that there are many incidents people have told me, that,

00:34:03.234 --> 00:34:05.567
“Mother, how we were saved,

00:34:05.667 --> 00:34:15.534
how we were brought to the brink of
death and then how we are just alive.”

00:34:15.634 --> 00:34:21.701
It is because the Divine needs
you, Divine doesn’t want you to die,

00:34:21.801 --> 00:34:24.601
or to finish off, it needs you very much.

00:34:24.701 --> 00:34:29.634
It has to do its work and you are the instrument of that Divine.

00:34:29.734 --> 00:34:38.000
If you have wisdom you are the best
instrument for the Divine to work it out.

00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:43.000
The devi’s powers first of all existed in Her body only

00:34:43.100 --> 00:34:51.267
and She killed so many rakshasas
and evil people – She did, kill it, actually.

00:34:51.367 --> 00:34:57.067
But now, there’s no need because you
all are there and you are the instruments.

00:34:57.167 --> 00:35:03.133
And it will all work out in such a way that
all those people who are trying to destroy

00:35:03.234 --> 00:35:08.801
the goodness, trying to destroy wise people,

00:35:09.067 --> 00:35:14.167
they will be killed, they’ll be finished, they’ll be destroyed.

00:35:14.267 --> 00:35:19.200
This is not to be done through
any outside instrument or anything.

00:35:19.300 --> 00:35:24.501
It’s your wisdom, is the biggest
instrument that will work it out.

00:35:24.601 --> 00:35:29.767
Do you know, when I came to America
first, I saw such a horrible thing here:

00:35:30.033 --> 00:35:33.634
that people were running after some horrible ‘gurus’

00:35:33.734 --> 00:35:36.667
and I never came [again], after nine years I came.

00:35:36.767 --> 00:35:39.267
Because I said, “These people are mad!

00:35:39.367 --> 00:35:43.133
How do they follow these horrible
people? And why do they believe into it?

00:35:43.234 --> 00:35:47.400
They have no wisdom to understand what is the Truth is like.”

00:35:47.501 --> 00:35:52.300
And it works out, now, today, you
can see there are so many people here.

00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.234
So, that is what is the wisdom part.

00:35:55.334 --> 00:36:00.100
And if this wisdom comes to
Americans they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:03.367
Not only come, but they will grow into it.

00:36:03.467 --> 00:36:06.200
But the wisdom will be to see,

00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:11.367
“What are we going to do, what
are we going to get, what is our aim?”

00:36:11.467 --> 00:36:16.267
All these things must be brought
to them, which is not done normally.

00:36:16.367 --> 00:36:20.067
We must talk to them, and we must tell them that,

00:36:20.167 --> 00:36:23.334
“What is within you is the Spirit.

00:36:23.434 --> 00:36:27.067
You should become the Spirit, every one of them has said so.

00:36:27.167 --> 00:36:31.300
So why not do that? And why not become the Spirit?”

00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:35.434
So, then they will themselves feel,

00:36:35.534 --> 00:36:40.267
“Yes, that’s true. It is said that you should become the Spirit.”

00:36:40.367 --> 00:36:45.000
They’ll go to Church, they’ll go
to temples, they’ll go here, there,

00:36:45.100 --> 00:36:48.000
not understanding why they are doing it?

00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:52.000
They need some sort of a protection, that’s why they go,

00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:56.400
but this protection comes from your spiritual status,

00:36:56.501 --> 00:37:00.801
where do you stand as far as the Spirit is concerned.

00:37:01.067 --> 00:37:03.667
Those who have enjoyed the Spirit,

00:37:03.767 --> 00:37:08.801
I have seen do not deviate from
the right path. But those who haven’t,

00:37:09.067 --> 00:37:14.267
they may call themselves Sahaj Yogis,
anything, but they can be very wrong.

00:37:14.367 --> 00:37:22.000
So, first of all, find out about
yourself. If you are a real Sahaj Yogi,

00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:28.033
if you really want to be an instrument of This Power,

00:37:28.133 --> 00:37:35.234
then, what you have to do is to become
full of bhakti and shraddha for that.

00:37:35.334 --> 00:37:40.234
And this bhakti and shraddha is very joy giving, I know that.

00:37:40.334 --> 00:37:46.367
It never makes you tired, it never troubles you, nothing!

00:37:46.467 --> 00:37:50.567
But it’s very nourishing and beautiful.

00:37:50.667 --> 00:37:57.167
But it should be at the right place with
the right aims and right understanding.

00:37:57.267 --> 00:38:01.300
For all that what you need again is wisdom.

00:38:01.400 --> 00:38:09.367
And you should try to find out – are you
wise enough? Are you wise, or are you not?

00:38:09.467 --> 00:38:15.634
It’s very difficult for every human being
to find out whether you are right or wrong

00:38:15.734 --> 00:38:21.467
because, you see the effects of this wisdom all around.

00:38:21.567 --> 00:38:30.300
So, the bhakti and shraddha to the Goddess
gives you, definitely gives you, wisdom.

00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:37.467
We have had some people in
India who did lots of bhakti, so called,

00:38:37.567 --> 00:38:40.100
and showed lots of shraddha,

00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.634
but they were not, they were not.

00:38:43.734 --> 00:38:49.133
Just they were talking about it,
or doing all kinds of things about it

00:38:49.234 --> 00:38:50.400
but they were not.

00:38:50.501 --> 00:38:52.033
So

00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:56.501
wisdom is something a very innate
quality, very innate, it’s not superficial.

00:38:56.601 --> 00:39:01.400
You cannot just say that this person is wise or not.

00:39:01.501 --> 00:39:06.601
It shows, that’s just like a power, it’s a power of understanding

00:39:06.701 --> 00:39:10.767
and is supported by the Power of the Goddess.

00:39:11.033 --> 00:39:16.567
So She is the giver of wisdom. This
is the biggest quality of the Goddess,

00:39:16.667 --> 00:39:19.067
that She is the giver of wisdom.

00:39:19.167 --> 00:39:23.434
And wisdom comes as a part of the evolutionary process.

00:39:23.534 --> 00:39:27.801
Now She has brought about all
the evolution so far, and to go further

00:39:28.067 --> 00:39:32.234
She is going to make you a very wise person.

00:39:32.334 --> 00:39:36.133
Even an ordinary sage in a village,

00:39:36.234 --> 00:39:41.300
in a far-fetched places is respected if he is a real sage.

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:45.601
But, [if] he is a stupid fellow, what can you do?

00:39:45.701 --> 00:39:50.400
He may befool you, may do all
kind of tricks and things like that.

00:39:50.501 --> 00:39:57.267
And then, does he get anything good for you? No, nothing.

00:39:57.367 --> 00:40:03.601
So first thing is: anybody who is
supposed to be your guru or supposed to be

00:40:03.701 --> 00:40:09.434
the person who is guiding you, must
have bhakti, bhakti of the Goddess.

00:40:09.534 --> 00:40:11.434
It’s very important to understand.

00:40:11.534 --> 00:40:17.667
Modern things have such, come to such a
limit, that they have no respect for the Goddess, no,

00:40:17.767 --> 00:40:20.100
they don’t even talk about the Goddess

00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:25.200
and they just talk about something
which cannot be explained and understood.

00:40:25.300 --> 00:40:28.200
If they talk about Christ they won’t talk about Him,

00:40:28.300 --> 00:40:33.467
that He is the one who said at the cross, “Behold the Mother”.

00:40:33.567 --> 00:40:37.133
What was the need to say that?

00:40:37.234 --> 00:40:40.434
Because He didn’t want His Mother to get into trouble,

00:40:40.534 --> 00:40:43.267
but He said, “Behold The Mother,”

00:40:43.367 --> 00:40:47.634
that means, “Look out for the Mother who is going to come.”

00:40:47.734 --> 00:40:50.501
They all have indicated and they have said so.

00:40:50.601 --> 00:40:54.534
But still we are busy with our own ego

00:40:54.634 --> 00:41:00.400
and our own understanding and
we run after things which are not real.

00:41:00.501 --> 00:41:07.367
First of all you must follow only
thing that is real, not unreal things.

00:41:07.467 --> 00:41:10.133
For that also, again, you need wisdom.

00:41:10.234 --> 00:41:13.467
I think for that you need wisdom very much more.

00:41:13.567 --> 00:41:16.501
And that is something, whether you have the wisdom first,

00:41:16.601 --> 00:41:22.234
or you have the blessings of the Mother, is between the two.

00:41:22.334 --> 00:41:30.400
So I have to tell you one thing that: before
you people start spreading Sahaja Yoga,

00:41:30.501 --> 00:41:35.534
please judge yourself. Just see if you are wise enough.

00:41:35.634 --> 00:41:40.133
Also see for yourself if you have the blessings of the Mother.

00:41:40.234 --> 00:41:47.701
Only the wise are, I should say, the people who know

00:41:47.801 --> 00:41:52.434
whether they have the Mother’s blessings or not.

00:41:52.534 --> 00:41:56.567
For that we have so many ways of understanding.

00:41:56.667 --> 00:41:59.367
First and foremost thing is meditation

00:41:59.467 --> 00:42:09.033
and feeling your vibrations on the
photograph and facing yourself clearly.

00:42:09.133 --> 00:42:14.501
If you are a realised soul, are you
really a good realised soul or not?

00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:20.000
Are you deep or not? Are your vibrations working out or not?

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:28.300
If you can see that then you will
realise that greater than all ambitions,

00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:38.400
the greatest is to become a devoted, wise personality.

00:42:38.501 --> 00:42:44.601
That is the one that will give you
the joy, joy for all kinds of things.

00:42:44.701 --> 00:42:50.634
Otherwise it is just a human being like others going about.

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:56.334
Now the time has come for this to
work out. It’s a special time, I should say.

00:42:56.434 --> 00:42:59.567
Although, quite a lot of struggle for me, no doubt,

00:42:59.667 --> 00:43:04.167
but doesn’t matter, I know, because
I have landed myself in the area

00:43:04.267 --> 00:43:07.734
where things are not so simple, it doesn’t matter.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.467
But, on the whole, what I feel is you can support me very much,

00:43:13.567 --> 00:43:18.501
you can support my work very much, if you have that wisdom.

00:43:18.601 --> 00:43:21.400
And the wisdom is to judge yourself:

00:43:21.501 --> 00:43:24.734
how many people you love? How you love?

00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.434
How you talk to them? What do you
want out of them? All this should come.

00:43:30.534 --> 00:43:35.200
Judge yourself – introspection.
Through introspection you can see it.

00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:40.467
So, for a Sahaja Yogi is important is introspection.

00:43:40.567 --> 00:43:44.434
Second one is meditation.

00:43:44.534 --> 00:43:48.367
And third one is to take vibrations.

00:43:48.467 --> 00:43:49.734
It’s very important.

00:43:49.767 --> 00:43:54.033
What I find, some of them say, “Mother,
we don’t do this, we don’t do that,”

00:43:54.133 --> 00:43:56.167
“But why? Why not do it?”

00:43:56.267 --> 00:43:59.133
“We do Sahaja Yoga!” Sahaja Yoga, which part?

00:43:59.234 --> 00:44:03.801
If you are not doing these basic
things, how are you a Sahaja Yogi?

00:44:04.067 --> 00:44:09.734
And then lots of complications
come out of them, they also suffer.

00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:16.167
I think one has to have again the wisdom
to understand what is Sahaja Yoga is.

00:44:16.267 --> 00:44:18.634
No one understands that sometimes, and

00:44:18.734 --> 00:44:21.701
they go on forming a group of people

00:44:21.801 --> 00:44:26.601
who are not at all understanding what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:26.701 --> 00:44:30.334
It’s a very, very deep personality.

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:34.701
Sahaja Yoga is not just by saying, “I am a Sahaja Yogi,”

00:44:34.801 --> 00:44:41.133
but it’s a very deep personality. And that deep personality

00:44:41.234 --> 00:44:46.501
has to be felt by others as the wise, very wise thing.

00:44:46.601 --> 00:44:52.400
Not that how much you talk or
shout or give lectures is important;

00:44:52.501 --> 00:44:54.767
is

00:44:54.801 --> 00:45:02.033
with peace, the tranquillity, the
capacity to love within you are important.

00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:09.334
And that’s how people can judge whether
you are really blessed by your Mother or not.

00:45:09.434 --> 00:45:14.100
So, this is one of the things very
important when I’ve come to America

00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:17.367
just to protect America from problems,

00:45:17.467 --> 00:45:21.200
because suddenly this has grown into problems.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:27.100
And it was inevitable because they were blind here

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:30.400
not to understand what’s going wrong with them

00:45:30.501 --> 00:45:34.434
and that blindness has brought them to this point

00:45:34.534 --> 00:45:38.267
that they start seeing their ego specially,

00:45:38.367 --> 00:45:42.534
which has ruined them – money orientation.

00:45:42.634 --> 00:45:46.567
All this has shown how stupid they have been to believe

00:45:46.667 --> 00:45:51.634
that they are very rich people and
they can do anything they want to

00:45:51.734 --> 00:45:58.133
with their money and with overpowering
of other countries and other people.

00:45:58.234 --> 00:46:01.200
First overpower yourself.

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:06.701
You have to know yourself first of all.
What’s the use of overpowering others?

00:46:06.801 --> 00:46:10.100
Those who do not know how to overpower themselves

00:46:10.200 --> 00:46:17.400
are always miserable, always in trouble because it reacts.

00:46:17.501 --> 00:46:21.367
If you try to overpower others, it reacts.

00:46:21.467 --> 00:46:25.267
For that you have to be absolutely introspecting,

00:46:25.367 --> 00:46:29.601
again and again I have been saying this that, “Introspect.”

00:46:29.701 --> 00:46:35.467
Of course, I must say, so many good Sahaj Yogis have come out now

00:46:35.567 --> 00:46:40.467
and they have worked it out, and
they are very good, simple, wise people.

00:46:40.567 --> 00:46:46.601
It’s such a great hope for me, I never
expected I will work it out that good.

00:46:46.701 --> 00:46:53.200
But it has worked out and always, always,
you must know you have That Power within you

00:46:53.300 --> 00:47:00.267
and that you must use that power
and not fall a prey into nonsensical ideas.

00:47:00.367 --> 00:47:02.200
Thank you very much.
