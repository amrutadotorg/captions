WEBVTT

00:04.930 --> 00:10.260
Today, we are going to worship the Goddess.

00:10.260 --> 00:22.520
That’s the, first the left side programming
is with Her, but later on, at Sahastrara,

00:22.520 --> 00:25.360
She’s the Adi Shakti.

00:25.360 --> 00:31.720
And, on the left side, whatever She does is
already written, as you must have seen, because

00:31.720 --> 00:53.790
She’s the memory and She’s the wisdom
and, that She protects you, is shown when

00:53.790 --> 01:01.079
She uses Her power over the Ganas.

01:01.079 --> 01:17.080
There are Ganas that are, as we know, responsible
for all kinds of corrections in you.

01:17.080 --> 01:31.060
These are the Ganas which act through the
left side.

01:31.060 --> 01:39.659
As we know very well that cancer is caused
by the problems of the Left side.

01:39.659 --> 01:51.829
And, on the left side are these Ganas, which
are completely in unison with the Devi’s

01:51.829 --> 01:53.049
powers.

01:53.049 --> 01:58.030
She doesn’t have to tell them, She doesn’t
have to guide them, they are already built

01:58.030 --> 01:59.810
up like that.

01:59.810 --> 02:10.019
And these Ganas are the ones which, I should
say, target, they target the diseases and

02:10.019 --> 02:16.640
cure you.

02:16.640 --> 02:23.760
We have cured many cancer patients and many
left-sided people through the Ganas.

02:23.760 --> 02:31.590
But Ganas won’t listen to anybody else.

02:31.590 --> 02:38.329
And Ganapati is their leader, their controlling
power.

02:38.329 --> 02:52.489
So, if your Ganapati is alright then problems
are less, but if the Ganapati is not alright,

02:52.489 --> 03:02.670
then all kinds of problems can come up and
they can torture you.

03:02.670 --> 03:10.569
This is one of the things I am so particular
about, that we must get our Ganeshas corrected.

03:10.569 --> 03:17.290
The other day I received a big envelope with
letters saying that, “Mother, difficult

03:17.290 --> 03:25.049
to control Ganas,” but [it’s] difficult
to control Ganapati Himself!

03:25.049 --> 03:29.230
So, what should we do when we get into traumas?

03:29.230 --> 03:41.799
A simple thing is, at such a point when you
are in a trauma, and when you cannot overcome

03:41.799 --> 03:49.620
this defect of the Ganapati, then what you
should do is to meditate.

03:49.620 --> 03:56.930
Meditation is the only way you can overcome
Ganas.

03:56.930 --> 04:07.829
The first of all is the upbringing of the
children and then the atmosphere as it exists.

04:07.829 --> 04:20.729
With these two important factors, you can
do well with the Ganas but the problem is

04:20.729 --> 04:28.099
that human beings get lost and they don’t
look after their Ganapati.

04:28.099 --> 04:36.780
So, as you worship the Goddess, you are also
worshipping Shri Ganesha who is the power

04:36.780 --> 04:39.370
behind Her.

04:39.370 --> 04:51.341
But the greatest power that is belonging to
the Mother is your protection, protection

04:51.341 --> 04:54.000
from all kinds of things.

04:54.000 --> 04:58.500
All the left hand side protections are there.

04:58.500 --> 05:06.110
They are described, as you must have learned,
in the Devi Mahatmyam, what a protections

05:06.110 --> 05:08.340
She gives you.

05:08.340 --> 05:19.360
So tremendous is Her protecting power, and
this protecting power gives you understanding:

05:19.360 --> 05:38.379
how kind She is and how very, very protective
of you, extremely protective.

05:38.379 --> 05:49.949
She’ll guide you all the time that you should
be protected, on the left side, and through

05:49.949 --> 05:53.430
Her Ganas She looks after you.

05:53.430 --> 06:05.599
But on the right side also, those who are
on the right side, the Goddess puts Her powers

06:05.599 --> 06:15.259
to put you right, to bring you back to normal
conditions, to humble you down and make you

06:15.259 --> 06:28.180
understand that you are a child of the Mother
and you have to behave like a child.

06:28.180 --> 06:36.240
But, if you go to extremes, then you develop
all kinds of complications of the right side

06:36.240 --> 06:38.550
also, as you develop on the left side.

06:38.550 --> 06:46.240
And the right side problems these days are
very, very common, which I have seen people

06:46.240 --> 06:49.720
cannot get over.

06:49.720 --> 06:56.699
So many diseases like Alzheimer and other
diseases come up, later on.

06:56.699 --> 07:00.729
First it starts with the liver.

07:00.729 --> 07:10.529
The liver is the main point, as we fall into
the trap of the liver.

07:10.529 --> 07:20.789
If you are thinking too much, if you are futuristic,
if you are aggressive, then the liver goes

07:20.789 --> 07:25.539
out because you use liver’s power to do
all that.

07:25.539 --> 07:32.129
And when your liver power is over, you are
finished with liver power, you can develop

07:32.129 --> 07:40.229
so many diseases, so many troubles that you
cannot overcome it, it’s very difficult.

07:40.229 --> 07:46.699
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, so many people’s
liver has been cured; so many people.

07:46.699 --> 07:54.599
And it has been doing wonderful work as far
as the liver is concerned, but one should

07:54.599 --> 08:00.710
humble down and try to keep the liver alright.

08:00.710 --> 08:11.919
So the protection is also built-in your body
by Ganas on the left hand side and by reactions

08:11.919 --> 08:21.330
on the right hand side, but the greatest thing
is the blessings of the Mother: the way She

08:21.330 --> 08:28.229
looks after you, the way She loves you and
the way She cares for you – which you should

08:28.229 --> 08:30.789
never take it for granted!

08:30.789 --> 08:40.699
You must meditate, you must meditate, is very
important, no question [that] without meditation

08:40.699 --> 08:46.700
you cannot keep yourself alright – it’s
no question.

08:46.700 --> 08:54.650
Meditation is the most important thing which
must be followed because that’s how you

08:54.650 --> 09:02.740
come close to Her vibrations, come to Her
nature.

09:02.740 --> 09:10.380
Even animals are so sensitive to Mother, very
sensitive to vibrations; animals are, but

09:10.380 --> 09:18.459
human beings have their own understanding,
have their own freedom, have their so-called

09:18.459 --> 09:27.860
intelligence and they fall a trap to it; they
follow things which they should not do.

09:27.860 --> 09:37.810
So what is necessary very much, in the country
like America, is the devotion and bhakti.

09:37.810 --> 09:40.370
These two things are not there.

09:40.370 --> 09:45.970
Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down
into it because they know what is bhakti,

09:45.970 --> 09:48.160
what is devotion.

09:48.160 --> 09:50.590
All this ego and all that melts away.

09:50.590 --> 09:53.760
But this bhakti is to be enjoyed.

09:53.760 --> 10:00.420
I don’t know how to create bhakti within
you – that I can’t say.

10:00.420 --> 10:07.130
But I have seen people with bhakti, they have
achieved great heights, though it’s a left

10:07.130 --> 10:08.480
side movement.

10:08.480 --> 10:12.860
With the left side movement they have achieved
great heights.

10:12.860 --> 10:20.399
I don’t know how the bhakti (devotion) and
shraddha (faith) has helped them so much.

10:20.399 --> 10:30.670
In this, I must say, Indians are the best
because they have this power of bhakti and

10:30.670 --> 10:31.670
of shraddha.

10:31.670 --> 10:37.560
It’s not madness, it’s not madness as
they have here: I have seen people who get

10:37.560 --> 10:41.940
into some sort of a cult or something, they
go mad.

10:41.940 --> 10:51.149
It’s not madness, bhakti is love, and love
which is understanding, which understands

10:51.149 --> 10:53.980
what is bhakti and shraddha.

10:53.980 --> 11:00.660
Unless and until you develop that bhakti and
shraddha within you, you cannot rise, you

11:00.660 --> 11:15.600
cannot rise above your problems, you cannot
rise above your personality because bhakti

11:15.600 --> 11:22.589
is something you cannot impose on anyone,
you cannot force on anybody.

11:22.589 --> 11:31.630
You can make somebody mad and say that he
can do bhakti, but he cannot.

11:31.630 --> 11:42.350
You have to have all your qualities absolutely
intact: you should be intelligent, you should

11:42.350 --> 11:48.980
be understanding – everything should be
there, but at that time the joy of bhakti

11:48.980 --> 11:50.780
is within you.

11:50.780 --> 11:58.480
And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing,
the Goddess Herself enters into your being,

11:58.480 --> 12:00.250
I should say.

12:00.250 --> 12:07.510
I have seen people, bhaktas, many great saints
in India who achieved a lot of height.

12:07.510 --> 12:11.360
They’ve gone too far into it.

12:11.360 --> 12:21.500
And if you read about them and, if you understand
them, you are amazed how, without any help,

12:21.500 --> 12:30.040
without any guidance, how could they go that
deep and worship Devi?

12:30.040 --> 12:36.800
Worshipping is not just out of sheer reading
or some sort of a chanting or anything, but

12:36.800 --> 12:46.350
it’s the deep attention of your heart; I
think it’s Spirit.

12:46.350 --> 12:54.779
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you
develop the bhakti and drop out all nonsensical

12:54.779 --> 13:02.910
ideas, all different things that have crawled
into your head, but you just develop the bhakti.

13:02.910 --> 13:10.509
Now all these qualities described, of the
Devi [that] are left sided, are in the brain:

13:10.509 --> 13:13.980
memory, ‘smruti rupena sansthita’.

13:13.980 --> 13:18.209
Other things also – whatever are described
– are in the brain.

13:18.209 --> 13:24.910
And then the bhakti reaches the state [where]
it just neutralises everything.

13:24.910 --> 13:31.250
All the problems of the brain are neutralised
and you become a wise person.

13:31.250 --> 13:36.370
So the greatest boon of the Devi is to give
you wisdom.

13:36.370 --> 13:43.639
You can call it awareness, you can call it
anything but it’s a kind of a wisdom by

13:43.639 --> 13:50.490
which you become absolutely a Divine personality.

13:50.490 --> 13:53.920
That wisdom you must reach through your bhakti.

13:53.920 --> 14:01.120
But, you see, we have people of all kinds:
some are very much in the shraddha, in the

14:01.120 --> 14:09.560
bhakti, in the devotion but they are wrongly
placed and they don’t understand to whom

14:09.560 --> 14:12.110
we should worship and where we should go.

14:12.110 --> 14:23.279
Now Sahaja Yoga is a actualisation, Sahaja
Yoga is a Sakshat, is actualisation, in which

14:23.279 --> 14:30.310
you know whom to worship and whom to surrender,
it’s not blind, in any way.

14:30.310 --> 14:36.029
Whatever is blind bhakti can take you to any
kind of nonsense and that’s how many cults

14:36.029 --> 14:44.450
have come up, many [of] these things have
come up, but that’s not a thing that sees,

14:44.450 --> 14:47.540
that knows, that understands.

14:47.540 --> 14:57.079
It should be understood by your intelligence,
by all your qualities – what is your bhakti

14:57.079 --> 14:58.079
is like.

14:58.079 --> 15:06.040
Now we have, through Kundalini awakening,
reached a very great height of understanding

15:06.040 --> 15:10.829
of bhakti, the power of bhakti.

15:10.829 --> 15:19.300
The greatest power of bhakti is that it protects
you, it protects you.

15:19.300 --> 15:29.150
Those people who are suffering from any kind
of trouble, any kind of problems, just get

15:29.150 --> 15:40.019
out of it because this bhakti of yours gives
you the right type of understanding, the understanding

15:40.019 --> 15:50.230
of your Self; also the understanding of surroundings,
understanding of the whole Universe, why people

15:50.230 --> 15:56.459
behave like this, why they are like this – all
this can be solved through your bhakti.

15:56.459 --> 16:04.139
It should not be blind, it should not be blind,
but it should be wise bhakti, wise with wisdom.

16:04.139 --> 16:09.470
Only possible through Sahaja Yoga, I think,
otherwise, whatever bhakti people do like

16:09.470 --> 16:11.750
mad, that cannot be bhakti.

16:11.750 --> 16:23.750
You don’t become mad, you become a wise
man, wise man as we had so many in the past.

16:23.750 --> 16:28.590
And the way they have talked about everything
is surprising.

16:28.590 --> 16:37.860
How they have said things about human awareness,
about your ascent is remarkable and sometimes

16:37.860 --> 16:46.910
I feel that they have really prepared a field
for me, a proper area for me, to talk to people.

16:46.910 --> 16:58.180
Especially in India, I don’t know why, traditionally
we are very, traditionally we are very much

16:58.180 --> 17:00.910
devoted people.

17:00.910 --> 17:04.140
In the same way all over it should happen.

17:04.140 --> 17:10.430
Because, in India of course there are mad
people also, there are cults, there are all

17:10.430 --> 17:18.250
kinds of things, no doubt, but actually there
we have saints who have guided us very well.

17:18.250 --> 17:24.050
Despite that you find in India people are
going astray, doing wrong things and wrong

17:24.050 --> 17:27.050
type of worshipping.

17:27.050 --> 17:41.840
This is true, no doubt, but it is just a funny
type of a madness, where there is no wisdom.

17:41.840 --> 17:47.040
What is [the difference] between a mad and
a sane person is, that a mad person has no

17:47.040 --> 17:48.700
wisdom.

17:48.700 --> 17:54.540
And those who have also so-called wisdom,
or so they say, that “we are very wise,”

17:54.540 --> 17:55.810
are sadly mistaken.

17:55.810 --> 18:03.590
Because the way they behave, the way they
commit mistakes, the way their whole attention

18:03.590 --> 18:13.080
is, the whole working is, is sometimes surprising
but [it’s] because they have no wisdom.

18:13.080 --> 18:17.450
First of all is, to test yourself you must
see, “Am I wise?

18:17.450 --> 18:19.330
Am I wise?

18:19.330 --> 18:25.310
Do I do wise things or I’m not doing?”

18:25.310 --> 18:28.960
So many complaints come to me, about Sahaja
Yogis also.

18:28.960 --> 18:32.790
I am surprised, why: why are they doing like
that?

18:32.790 --> 18:37.250
I would say, still, they have not reached
the state of bhakti.

18:37.250 --> 18:43.970
Bhakti and shraddha, these two things are
missing in the Western life, I must say.

18:43.970 --> 18:48.090
We should come back, we should develop, we
should grow.

18:48.090 --> 18:51.640
But, even in the Eastern life now it’s missing.

18:51.640 --> 18:55.820
For them the ideal is now the Western life.

18:55.820 --> 19:03.810
Once you take to Western life, that part is
over because the whole thing is judged with

19:03.810 --> 19:14.050
ideas: what is beneficial, what is helpful
in life.

19:14.050 --> 19:21.910
But bhakti and shraddha, according to them,
is of no use, that doesn’t help.

19:21.910 --> 19:27.540
Most of the people nowadays think like that
but you are very few who have understood what

19:27.540 --> 19:30.660
is bhakti and what is shraddha.

19:30.660 --> 19:36.170
So, I would say, the Goddess gives you bhakti
and shraddha.

19:36.170 --> 19:38.410
By what?

19:38.410 --> 19:45.590
She gives you through your meditation; that
you see so many miracles happening in your

19:45.590 --> 19:46.590
life and you are amazed.

19:46.590 --> 19:49.150
“How this has happened?

19:49.150 --> 19:51.240
We never expected this to happen.

19:51.240 --> 19:55.720
How it has happened, how it has worked out?”

19:55.720 --> 19:57.640
Also She corrects you.

19:57.640 --> 20:04.330
All the time, if you are aware, She corrects
you and tells you, “Don’t go this way!

20:04.330 --> 20:06.150
You are going on the ego side."

20:06.150 --> 20:09.630
Or She’ll tell you, “You are going on
the left side."

20:09.630 --> 20:12.540
She’s the one who corrects, throughout.

20:12.540 --> 20:19.610
We get into diseases and we are trapped into
all kinds of things; it is because we don’t

20:19.610 --> 20:20.610
have bhakti.

20:20.610 --> 20:30.521
In the bhakti, you have to depend on the wisdom
of the Mother, wisdom of the Shakti, that

20:30.521 --> 20:37.490
She looks after you, She finds you out the
way and She will help you.

20:37.490 --> 20:45.570
If you start becoming on your own and thinking
that, “I am alright, I can do this, I can

20:45.570 --> 20:50.370
do that,” you will find inevitably that
you are wrong, that you had a very wrong idea

20:50.370 --> 20:53.960
about yourself and about the Divine.

20:53.960 --> 20:58.950
So, what is the most important point is surrendering.

20:58.950 --> 21:01.070
The word ‘Islam’ means surrender.

21:01.070 --> 21:07.920
But Mohammed Sahib has described what you
should have before surrender is your Realisation.

21:07.920 --> 21:13.800
But, you have seen, even after Realisation
people take time to settle down.

21:13.800 --> 21:20.330
But once you are settled down you understand
that you are under a protection of the Goddess,

21:20.330 --> 21:26.240
that you see every day how it works and how
it helps you.

21:26.240 --> 21:34.310
Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga, so-called,
have great respect for me but are not fully

21:34.310 --> 21:40.630
there; then they suffer and they have problems
and then they ask me, “Mother, how is it

21:40.630 --> 21:42.060
I have got this problem?”

21:42.060 --> 21:47.080
I don’t tell them, because you cant tell
anything to human beings, you see, they are

21:47.080 --> 21:48.080
very aggressive.

21:48.080 --> 21:57.290
But, the fact is because you are not one with
the Divine.

21:57.290 --> 22:03.740
And with the Divine if you are one, you’ll
have nothing but compassion and love, nothing

22:03.740 --> 22:04.740
else.

22:04.740 --> 22:07.910
And everything you will do so smoothly, so
nicely.

22:07.910 --> 22:13.750
People may not understand, like they crucified
Christ, they did all kind of things -agreed.

22:13.750 --> 22:20.420
But now, you should ask for the protection
of the Goddess because that is the greatest

22:20.420 --> 22:27.200
quality of the Goddess, that She protects
you from all problems, from all troubles,

22:27.200 --> 22:35.010
from all kinds of nonsensical things that
can happen.

22:35.010 --> 22:37.500
And there are so many things that happen.

22:37.500 --> 22:44.780
I tell you, I was told that one of the leaders
of Sahaja Yogi was killed.

22:44.780 --> 22:47.010
I said, “Not possible!”

22:47.010 --> 22:52.840
And the fellow was in Rome, he was not killed.

22:52.840 --> 22:59.140
So, it’s not possible that a young man should
be killed like that.

22:59.140 --> 23:03.410
Of course, if somebody is old you have to
die, but that he was killed, was not a right

23:03.410 --> 23:04.410
thing.

23:04.410 --> 23:10.450
So it is the protection, not only physical,
mental, emotional, but spiritual protection

23:10.450 --> 23:12.260
comes to you.

23:12.260 --> 23:16.320
Spiritual protection in that what you do is
that you don’t do wrong things.

23:16.320 --> 23:22.900
You don’t kill anybody, you don’t torture
anybody, you are not rude to anybody, that

23:22.900 --> 23:29.160
is the situation into which you all can enter
because you are Sahaja Yogis.

23:29.160 --> 23:31.210
You can achieve it.

23:31.210 --> 23:40.430
You have a power to do it because you have
so much shraddha and so much understanding

23:40.430 --> 23:47.910
that you have reached the certain state of
protection, of growth of wisdom.

23:47.910 --> 23:54.580
Now first test your wisdom, you must test
your wisdom, “If I am doing this, is this

23:54.580 --> 23:58.230
wise, is it good, why I am doing it?”

23:58.230 --> 24:03.780
First test your wisdom, then you’ll find
out that many things you do which are wrong,

24:03.780 --> 24:06.220
which should not have been done.

24:06.220 --> 24:12.260
But first your wisdom must develop and you
must see that your wisdom works and helps

24:12.260 --> 24:13.260
you.

24:13.260 --> 24:17.210
I have seen now, yesterday’s drama (evening
programme play), you must have seen that girl

24:17.210 --> 24:22.270
she is very sensitive and she could see through
her wisdom what was good.

24:22.270 --> 24:31.360
If you cannot find out what is good and what
is bad that means the wisdom is lacking.

24:31.360 --> 24:37.330
If you cannot find out what should you do
then the wisdom is lacking.

24:37.330 --> 24:45.500
But, if you have the wisdom, then you will
immediately know that this is wrong.

24:45.500 --> 24:51.610
Apart from that, you’ll be saved from all
kinds of problems; it’s a fact, I have seen

24:51.610 --> 24:58.650
with so many people like that, who have been
saved, not only from death, but from all kinds

24:58.650 --> 25:02.980
of catastrophes, all kinds.

25:02.980 --> 25:09.520
And I was amazed how these Sahaja Yogis are
helped by the Divine.

25:09.520 --> 25:14.250
Divine is a power, everywhere it exists.

25:14.250 --> 25:21.680
But it will only help the people who are Sahaj
Yogis, who are divine – not the people who

25:21.680 --> 25:29.490
are not, it will never help you, on the contrary
it might punish in a way that is never expected.

25:29.490 --> 25:36.610
So, one has to be careful to test oneself,
what I call ‘introspection’: Have you

25:36.610 --> 25:40.730
been wise in dealing with certain problems?

25:40.730 --> 25:42.760
What has been your style?

25:42.760 --> 25:46.580
Is it money oriented or it is domination oriented.

25:46.580 --> 25:52.230
But what sort of a power it was that you were
working under?

25:52.230 --> 25:55.250
You have to introspect to find out.

25:55.250 --> 26:02.930
And you will be amazed, very much amazed,
that even in the name of God you can do wrong

26:02.930 --> 26:03.930
things.

26:03.930 --> 26:07.820
Lots of wrong things have been done in the
name of God and that’s why today we have

26:07.820 --> 26:14.590
such a big chaos of so called ‘religions’,
when nothing was religion with religion as

26:14.590 --> 26:19.270
such, and those religious people who talked
about it – nothing wrong – but the way

26:19.270 --> 26:23.630
people absorbed it and the way people used
it was wrong.

26:23.630 --> 26:26.290
Because [what] they lacked is wisdom.

26:26.290 --> 26:32.630
And the wisdom is the thing which really is
not just assumption that, “I am very wise

26:32.630 --> 26:40.440
and all that,” but it asserts, it works
out and it shows what is good and what is

26:40.440 --> 26:41.440
bad.

26:41.440 --> 26:49.040
Wisdom is the sign of a person who is really
a realised soul of a very high level.

26:49.040 --> 26:56.020
If you don’t have wisdom whatever you may
do, you might feel satisfied about it, but

26:56.020 --> 26:59.220
the wisdom part is very, very important.

26:59.220 --> 27:09.940
That is the most governing part within us
and as you know, Ganesha is the giver of wisdom.

27:09.940 --> 27:24.040
That’s why Ganesha must be worshipped.

27:24.040 --> 27:37.940
With the proper upbringing Shri Ganesha is
established, who is nothing but the giver

27:37.940 --> 27:44.390
of wisdom.

27:44.390 --> 27:52.390
And this wisdom is innate, you don’t have
to judge it, it’s innate within us, grown

27:52.390 --> 27:55.970
up, just like any other qualities in us.

27:55.970 --> 28:06.640
It takes time with some people, it takes time,
no doubt, but once it comes in, such a person

28:06.640 --> 28:14.880
becomes quiet, simple and absolutely truthful.

28:14.880 --> 28:18.450
He knows about it.

28:18.450 --> 28:27.590
And this is the thing one should develop is,
“How far am I wise?”

28:27.590 --> 28:32.370
You see in this world people are protesting
for this, protesting for that, fighting for

28:32.370 --> 28:34.680
this, doing all kinds of things.

28:34.680 --> 28:42.490
But if you have wisdom, then you don’t have
to do anything of the kind!

28:42.490 --> 28:49.600
What happens is that automatically people
understand that he’s a wise man.

28:49.600 --> 28:54.010
From ancient times everywhere a wise man has
been praised.

28:54.010 --> 29:00.770
He’s not worried about his financial side,
or emotional side, nothing!

29:00.770 --> 29:06.160
What he is worried is, “Have I been a wise
person?”

29:06.160 --> 29:10.670
That is the first sign of the blessings of
God.

29:10.670 --> 29:18.850
The one who has blessings of Divine is a wise
person, he’s very wise and his wisdom is

29:18.850 --> 29:21.490
shown by his silence.

29:21.490 --> 29:32.020
And the Whole Power, the Divine Power, uses
that person as a media and works tremendously.

29:32.020 --> 29:36.110
That man himself is surprised how it has helped
him.

29:36.110 --> 29:44.049
A woman can have that, a man can have it,
anybody can have that wisdom, that profoundness,

29:44.049 --> 29:54.530
that temperament which is so beautiful and
so empowering.

29:54.530 --> 30:02.290
Such a person doesn’t curse anyone, doesn’t
bother to curse anyone, but it works.

30:02.290 --> 30:08.150
He never gets angry with anyone, but it works.

30:08.150 --> 30:22.540
He doesn’t lose temper, no, but some temper
works and harms you which you never expected.

30:22.540 --> 30:29.970
It is within us, within our power as human
beings, to be wise.

30:29.970 --> 30:37.130
I have seen animals have such a sensitivity
to vibrations, extremely sensitive.

30:37.130 --> 30:38.290
How?

30:38.290 --> 30:39.670
Because their wisdom is intact.

30:39.670 --> 30:44.100
It works in them, they are not conscious of
it.

30:44.100 --> 30:51.750
The difference is, human beings are conscious
of their wisdom, that’s the only difference.

30:51.750 --> 30:56.930
Animals have wisdom, but automatic, we should
say, natural.

30:56.930 --> 31:05.810
But we have inculcated this, or we have developed
this wisdom within us, through what?

31:05.810 --> 31:13.780
Through our meditation, through our understanding
of bhakti and shraddha.

31:13.780 --> 31:21.850
So it’s very important to understand the
value of bhakti within us.

31:21.850 --> 31:24.700
You cannot superficially touch it.

31:24.700 --> 31:28.940
Those who are superficial will never get it.

31:28.940 --> 31:39.050
Wisdom only comes through understanding what
is wisdom is.

31:39.050 --> 31:45.320
You might find somebody extremely wise, he
may be your servant, may be your driver, may

31:45.320 --> 31:51.390
be anyone, and you are amazed how such a person
can be so wise.

31:51.390 --> 31:59.490
Because, maybe from his last life, he has
got it within him, or he has gone into it

31:59.490 --> 32:03.010
and he found it.

32:03.010 --> 32:10.060
Is not the estate of one person, is not the
property of one person but it can belong to

32:10.060 --> 32:12.170
many of them.

32:12.170 --> 32:19.110
So the Sahaj Yogi is the one who has to have
that wisdom, “Why I am doing this?

32:19.110 --> 32:20.250
What is the need to do it?”

32:20.250 --> 32:23.950
They don’t have to ask any questions, they
just don’t do wrong things.

32:23.950 --> 32:26.750
They just don’t do wrong things.

32:26.750 --> 32:30.030
They are always on the right path.

32:30.030 --> 32:35.790
That is the sign of a Sahaj Yogi, I believe,
and which is the blessing of the Goddess.If

32:35.790 --> 32:42.700
there is the Power of the Goddess working
in you, you will have the wisdom to work it

32:42.700 --> 32:43.700
out.

32:43.700 --> 32:48.300
Now you have seen many people coming to America,
doing all kinds of things.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.330
They all have disappeared.

32:50.330 --> 32:52.490
There’s no support to them, where are they?

32:52.490 --> 32:53.650
They are finished.

32:53.650 --> 32:59.750
Because they were money oriented, or power
oriented, I don’t know what they were oriented!

32:59.750 --> 33:01.780
And they have lost it.

33:01.780 --> 33:09.530
But for a person who is standing in his wisdom,
is the sage as they call him, is the saint

33:09.530 --> 33:11.990
as they call it.

33:11.990 --> 33:20.180
But, this can be every Sahaja Yogi could be
a saint, could be a sage, every Sahaja Yogi

33:20.180 --> 33:21.420
could be that.

33:21.420 --> 33:26.340
But if you lose your wisdom then you are no
good.

33:26.340 --> 33:33.780
So, I have to tell you one thing: it’s your
wisdom which will save you.

33:33.780 --> 33:39.010
Your wisdom will unconsciously help you.

33:39.010 --> 33:47.190
There was one gentleman, Sahaj Yogi, once
he was going somewhere in the car and suddenly

33:47.190 --> 33:52.020
decided to go on to another road, suddenly.

33:52.020 --> 33:56.930
And what happened, that on that road there
was a very big accident and he would have

33:56.930 --> 34:00.100
been in that accident.

34:00.100 --> 34:05.910
Like that there are many incidents people
have told me, that, “Mother, how we were

34:05.910 --> 34:15.929
saved, how we were brought to the brink of
death and then how we are just alive."

34:15.929 --> 34:23.169
It is because the Divine needs you, Divine
doesn’t want you to die, or to finish off,

34:23.169 --> 34:24.879
it needs you very much.

34:24.879 --> 34:30.279
It has to do its work and you are the instrument
of that Divine.

34:30.279 --> 34:38.250
If you have wisdom you are the best instrument
for the Divine to work it out.

34:38.250 --> 34:46.269
The Devi’s powers first of all existed in
Her body only and She killed so many rakshasas

34:46.269 --> 34:50.859
and evil people – She did, kill it, actually.

34:50.859 --> 34:56.200
But now, there’s no need because you all
are there and you are the instruments.

34:56.200 --> 35:01.970
And it will all work out in such a way that
all those people who are trying to destroy

35:01.970 --> 35:13.140
the goodness, trying to destroy wise people,
they will be killed, they’ll be finished,

35:13.140 --> 35:14.470
they’ll be destroyed.

35:14.470 --> 35:19.140
This is not to be done through any outside
instrument or anything.

35:19.140 --> 35:24.329
It’s your wisdom, is the biggest instrument
that will work it out.

35:24.329 --> 35:30.539
Do you know, when I came to America first,
I saw such a horrible thing here: that people

35:30.539 --> 35:36.710
were running after some horrible ‘gurus’
and I never came [again], after nine years

35:36.710 --> 35:39.200
I came because I said, “These people are
mad!

35:39.200 --> 35:41.759
How do they follow these horrible people?

35:41.759 --> 35:43.269
And why do they believe into it?

35:43.269 --> 35:46.519
They have no wisdom to understand what is
the Truth is like."

35:46.519 --> 35:51.789
And it works out, now, today, you can see
there are so many people here.

35:51.789 --> 35:55.579
So, that is what is the wisdom part.

35:55.579 --> 36:00.380
And if this wisdom comes to Americans they’ll
come to Sahaja Yoga.

36:00.380 --> 36:01.539
Not only come, but they will grow into it.

36:01.539 --> 36:09.869
But the wisdom will be, to see, “What are
we going to do, what are we going to get,

36:09.869 --> 36:11.720
what is our aim?”

36:11.720 --> 36:16.099
All these things must be brought to them,
which is not done normally.

36:16.099 --> 36:23.609
We must talk to them, and we must tell them
that, “What is within you is the Spirit.

36:23.609 --> 36:27.359
You should become the Spirit, everyone of
them has said so.

36:27.359 --> 36:29.369
So why not do that?

36:29.369 --> 36:31.550
And why not become the Spirit?”

36:31.550 --> 36:37.030
So, then they will themselves feel, “Yes,
that’s true.

36:37.030 --> 36:42.609
It’s said that you should become the Spirit."

36:42.609 --> 36:45.910
They’ll go to Church, they’ll go to temples,
they’ll go here, there, not understanding

36:45.910 --> 36:48.230
why they are doing it?

36:48.230 --> 36:54.410
They need some sort of a protection, that’s
why they go, but this protection comes from

36:54.410 --> 37:01.400
your spiritual status, where do you stand
as far as the Spirit is concerned.

37:01.400 --> 37:07.210
Those who have enjoyed the Spirit, I have
seen do not deviate from the right path.

37:07.210 --> 37:13.440
But those who haven’t, they may call themselves
Sahaj Yogis, anything, but they can be very

37:13.440 --> 37:14.440
wrong.

37:14.440 --> 37:18.000
So, first of all, find out about yourself.

37:18.000 --> 37:28.869
If you are a real Sahaj Yogi, if you really
want to be a instrument of This Power, then,

37:28.869 --> 37:35.609
what you have to do is to become full of bhakti
and shraddha for that.

37:35.609 --> 37:40.520
And this bhakti and shraddha is very joy giving,
I know that.

37:40.520 --> 37:46.349
It never makes you tired, it never troubles
you, nothing!

37:46.349 --> 37:50.900
But it’s very nourishing and beautiful.

37:50.900 --> 37:57.589
But it should be at the right place with the
right aims and right understanding.

37:57.589 --> 38:01.700
For all that what you need again is wisdom.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.770
And you should try to find out – are you
wise enough?

38:03.770 --> 38:08.799
Are you wise, or are you not?

38:08.799 --> 38:15.900
It’s very difficult for every human being
to find out whether you are right or wrong

38:15.900 --> 38:21.740
because, you see the effects of this wisdom
all around.

38:21.740 --> 38:30.559
So, the bhakti and shraddha to the Goddess
gives you, definitely gives you, wisdom.

38:30.559 --> 38:39.220
We have had some people in India who did lots
of bhakti, so called, and showed lots of shraddha,

38:39.220 --> 38:43.420
but they were not, they were not.

38:43.420 --> 38:50.319
Just they were talking about it, or doing
all kinds of things about it but they were

38:50.319 --> 38:51.319
not.

38:51.319 --> 38:56.890
So wisdom is something a very innate quality,
very innate, its not superficial.

38:56.890 --> 39:01.369
You cannot just say that this person, is he
wise or not.

39:01.369 --> 39:09.839
It shows, just like a power, it’s a power
of understanding and is supported by the Power

39:09.839 --> 39:11.319
of the Goddess.

39:11.319 --> 39:13.010
So She is the giver of wisdom.

39:13.010 --> 39:19.220
This is the biggest quality of the Goddess,
that She is the giver of wisdom.

39:19.220 --> 39:23.230
And wisdom comes as a part of the evolutionary
process.

39:23.230 --> 39:29.529
Now She has brought about all the evolution
so far, and to go further She is going to

39:29.529 --> 39:32.799
make you a very wise person.

39:32.799 --> 39:40.849
Even an ordinary sage in a village, in a far-fetched
places is respected if he is a real sage.

39:40.849 --> 39:46.730
But, [if] he is a stupid fellow, what can
you do?

39:46.730 --> 39:50.769
He may befool you, may do all kind of tricks
and things like that.

39:50.769 --> 39:56.259
And then, does he get anything good for you?

39:56.259 --> 39:57.549
No, nothing.

39:57.549 --> 40:04.400
So first thing is: anybody who is supposed
to be your guru or supposed to be the person

40:04.400 --> 40:09.150
who is guiding you, must have bhakti, bhakti
of the Goddess.

40:09.150 --> 40:11.460
It’s very important to understand.

40:11.460 --> 40:17.200
Modern things have such, come to such a limit,
that they have no respect for the Goddess,

40:17.200 --> 40:23.009
no, they don’t even talk about the Goddess
and they just talk about something which cannot

40:23.009 --> 40:24.599
be explained and understood.

40:24.599 --> 40:30.880
If they talk about Christ they won’t talk
about Him, that He is the one who said at

40:30.880 --> 40:33.839
the cross, “Behold the Mother”.

40:33.839 --> 40:37.579
What was the need to say that?

40:37.579 --> 40:43.539
Because He didn’t want His Mother to get
into trouble, but He said, “Behold The Mother,”

40:43.539 --> 40:47.930
that means, “Look out for the Mother who
is going to come."

40:47.930 --> 40:54.740
They all have indicated and they have said
so but still we are busy with our own ego

40:54.740 --> 41:00.900
and our own understanding and we run after
things which are not real.

41:00.900 --> 41:06.279
First of all you must follow only thing that
is real, not unreal things.

41:06.279 --> 41:10.320
For that also, again, you need wisdom.

41:10.320 --> 41:13.920
I think for that you need wisdom very much
more.

41:13.920 --> 41:17.750
And that is something, whether you have the
wisdom first, or you have the blessings of

41:17.750 --> 41:22.559
the Mother, is between the two.

41:22.559 --> 41:31.330
So I have to tell you one thing that: before
you people start spreading Sahaja Yoga, please

41:31.330 --> 41:32.510
judge yourself.

41:32.510 --> 41:36.059
Just see if you are wise.

41:36.059 --> 41:39.829
Also see for yourself if you have the blessings
of the Mother.

41:39.829 --> 41:52.799
Only the wise are the people who know whether
they have the Mother’s blessings or not.

41:52.799 --> 41:56.970
For that we have so many ways of understanding.

41:56.970 --> 42:05.799
First and foremost thing is meditation and
feeling your vibrations on the photograph

42:05.799 --> 42:09.380
and facing yourself clearly.

42:09.380 --> 42:14.970
If you are a realised soul, are you really
a good realised soul or not?

42:14.970 --> 42:17.019
Are you deep or not?

42:17.019 --> 42:19.890
Are your vibrations working out or not?

42:19.890 --> 42:29.200
If you can see that then you will realise
that greater than all ambitions, the greatest

42:29.200 --> 42:37.299
is to become a devoted, wise personality.

42:37.299 --> 42:45.019
That is the one that will give you the joy,
joy for all kinds of things.

42:45.019 --> 42:50.550
Otherwise it is just a human being like others
going about.

42:50.550 --> 42:54.140
Now the time has come for this to work out.

42:54.140 --> 42:56.319
It’s a special time, I should say.

42:56.319 --> 43:01.059
Although, quite a lot of struggle for me,
no doubt, but doesn’t matter, I know, because

43:01.059 --> 43:08.480
I have landed myself in the area where things
are not so simple, it doesn’t matter.

43:08.480 --> 43:15.349
But, on the whole, what I feel is you can
support me very much, you can support my work

43:15.349 --> 43:18.290
very much, if you have that wisdom.

43:18.290 --> 43:23.020
And the wisdom is to judge yourself: how many
people you love?

43:23.020 --> 43:24.630
How you love?

43:24.630 --> 43:26.990
How you talk to them?

43:26.990 --> 43:28.859
What do you want out of them?

43:28.859 --> 43:30.640
All this should come.

43:30.640 --> 43:33.019
Judge yourself – introspection.

43:33.019 --> 43:35.000
Through introspection you can see it.

43:35.000 --> 43:40.849
So, for a Sahaja Yogi is important is introspection.

43:40.849 --> 43:44.740
Second one is meditation.

43:44.740 --> 43:48.009
And third one is to take vibrations.

43:48.009 --> 43:49.710
It’s very important.

43:49.710 --> 43:53.660
What I find, some of them say, “Mother,
we don’t do this, we don’t do that,”

43:53.660 --> 43:54.660
“But why?

43:54.660 --> 43:56.079
Why not do it?”

43:56.079 --> 43:57.690
“We do Sahaja Yoga!”

43:57.690 --> 43:59.309
Sahaja Yoga, which part?

43:59.309 --> 44:04.279
If you are not doing these basic things, how
are you a Sahaja Yogi?

44:04.279 --> 44:09.380
And then lots of complications come out of
them, they also suffer.

44:09.380 --> 44:16.500
I think one has to have again the wisdom to
understand what is Sahaja Yoga is.

44:16.500 --> 44:22.799
No one understands that sometimes, and they
go on forming a group of people who are not

44:22.799 --> 44:25.799
at all understanding what is Sahaja Yoga.

44:25.799 --> 44:29.730
It’s a very, very deep personality.

44:29.730 --> 44:38.430
Sahaja Yoga is not just by saying, “I am
a Sahaja Yogi,” but it’s a very deep personality,

44:38.430 --> 44:46.900
and that deep personality has to be felt by
others as the wise, very wise thing.

44:46.900 --> 44:53.630
Not that how much you talk or shout or give
lectures is important; is with peace, the

44:53.630 --> 45:03.230
tranquillity, the capacity to love within
you are important and that’s how people

45:03.230 --> 45:09.740
can judge whether you are really blessed by
your Mother or not.

45:09.740 --> 45:15.279
So, this is one of the things very important
when I’ve come to America just to protect

45:15.279 --> 45:21.470
America from problems, because suddenly this
has grown into problems.

45:21.470 --> 45:29.349
And it was inevitable because they were blind
here not to understand what’s going wrong

45:29.349 --> 45:36.099
with them and that blindness has brought them
to this point that they start seeing their

45:36.099 --> 45:42.970
ego specially, which has ruined them – money
orientation.

45:42.970 --> 45:48.780
All this has shown how stupid they have been
to believe that they are very rich people

45:48.780 --> 45:56.410
and they can do anything they want to with
their money and with overpowering of other

45:56.410 --> 45:59.240
countries and other people.

45:59.240 --> 46:01.369
First overpower yourself.

46:01.369 --> 46:04.369
You have to know yourself first of all.

46:04.369 --> 46:07.160
What’s the use of overpowering others?

46:07.160 --> 46:15.410
Those who do not know how to overpower themselves
are always miserable, always in trouble because

46:15.410 --> 46:16.410
it reacts.

46:16.410 --> 46:21.269
If you try to overpower others, it reacts.

46:21.269 --> 46:29.240
For that you have to be absolutely introspecting,
again and again I have been saying this that,

46:29.240 --> 46:30.240
“Introspect."

46:30.240 --> 46:36.359
Of course, I must say, so many good Sahaj
Yogis have come out now and they have worked

46:36.359 --> 46:40.140
it out, and they are very good, simple, wise
people.

46:40.140 --> 46:47.779
It’s such a great hope for me, I never expected
I will work it out that good, but it has worked

46:47.779 --> 46:54.789
out and always, always, you must know you
have That Power within you and then must use

46:54.789 --> 47:00.000
that power and not fall a prey into nonsensical
ideas.

47:00.000 --> 47:01.980
Thank you very much
