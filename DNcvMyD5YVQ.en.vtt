1
00:04.734 --> 00:11.734
Today, we are going to worship the Goddess.

2
00:12.000 --> 00:19.400
That’s the, first the left side programming is with Her,

3
00:19.501 --> 00:25.400
but later on, at Sahasrara, She’s the Adi Shakti.

4
00:25.501 --> 00:31.367
And, on the left side, whatever She does
is already written, as you must have seen,

5
00:31.467 --> 00:34.367
because She’s the memory

6
00:37.100 --> 00:43.234
and that She’s the wisdom and,

7
00:47.534 --> 01:01.634
that She protects you, is shown when
She uses Her power over the Ganas.

8
01:03.100 --> 01:12.601
There are Ganas that are, as we know, responsible

9
01:12.701 --> 01:17.300
for all kinds of corrections in you.

10
01:20.767 --> 01:32.467
These are the Ganas which act through the left side.

11
01:32.567 --> 01:39.734
As we know very well that cancer is
caused by the problems of the Left side.

12
01:40.000 --> 01:52.534
And, on the left side are these Ganas, which
are completely in unison with the Devi’s powers.

13
01:52.701 --> 01:54.367
She doesn’t have to

14
01:54.400 --> 01:59.367
tell them, She doesn’t have to guide
them, they are already built up like that.

15
01:59.467 --> 02:06.033
And these Ganas are the ones which, I should say, target,

16
02:06.133 --> 02:12.234
they target the diseases and cure you.

17
02:16.434 --> 02:24.734
We have cured many cancer patients and
many left-sided people through the Ganas.

18
02:26.767 --> 02:31.033
But Ganas won’t listen to anybody else.

19
02:31.133 --> 02:38.000
And Ganapati is their leader, I should say, their controlling power.

20
02:40.434 --> 02:49.434
So, if your Ganapati is alright then problems are less,

21
02:49.534 --> 02:57.667
but if the Ganapati is not alright,
then all kinds of problems can come up

22
02:57.767 --> 03:02.300
and they can torture you.

23
03:02.400 --> 03:06.300
This is one of the things I am so particular about,

24
03:06.400 --> 03:11.033
that we must get our Ganeshas corrected.

25
03:11.133 --> 03:16.067
The other day I received a big envelope with letters saying that,

26
03:16.167 --> 03:19.767
“Mother, difficult to control Ganas,”

27
03:20.033 --> 03:24.434
but [it’s] difficult to control Ganapati Himself!

28
03:24.534 --> 03:30.000
So, what should we do? We’ll get into traumas!

29
03:30.100 --> 03:37.801
A simple thing is, at such a point when you are in a trauma,

30
03:38.067 --> 03:45.567
and when you cannot overcome this defect of the Ganapati,

31
03:45.667 --> 03:50.167
then what you should do is to meditate.

32
03:50.267 --> 03:56.501
Meditation is the only way you can overcome Ganas.

33
03:56.601 --> 04:02.567
The first of all is the upbringing of the children

34
04:02.667 --> 04:08.200
and then the atmosphere as it exists.

35
04:08.300 --> 04:15.267
With these two important factors,

36
04:15.367 --> 04:18.434
you can do well with the Ganas.

37
04:18.534 --> 04:24.133
But the problem is that human beings get lost,

38
04:24.234 --> 04:29.167
and they don’t look after their Ganapati.

39
04:29.267 --> 04:35.300
So, as you worship the Goddess, you are also worshipping Shri Ganesha

40
04:35.400 --> 04:39.434
who is the power behind Her.

41
04:41.467 --> 04:50.534
But the greatest power that is
belonging to the Mother is your protection,

42
04:50.634 --> 04:54.400
protection from all kinds of things.

43
04:54.501 --> 04:59.534
All the left hand side protections are there.

44
04:59.634 --> 05:03.434
They are described, as you must have learned,

45
05:03.534 --> 05:08.234
in the Devi Mahatmyam, what a protections She gives you.

46
05:08.334 --> 05:12.434
So tremendous in Her protecting power,

47
05:12.534 --> 05:19.300
and this protecting power gives you understanding:

48
05:19.400 --> 05:25.000
how kind She is and how,

49
05:30.767 --> 05:39.133
I should say, how very, very protective of you, extremely protective.

50
05:39.234 --> 05:46.133
She’ll guide you all the time that you should be protected,

51
05:46.234 --> 05:54.434
on the left side, and through Her Ganas She looks after you.

52
05:54.534 --> 06:00.767
But on the right side also, those who are on the right side,

53
06:01.033 --> 06:07.701
the Goddess puts Her powers to put you right,

54
06:07.801 --> 06:12.033
to bring you back to normal conditions,

55
06:12.133 --> 06:19.601
to humble you down and make you understand that

56
06:19.701 --> 06:27.667
you are a child of the Mother and you have to behave like a child.

57
06:29.701 --> 06:33.300
But, if you go to extremes,

58
06:33.400 --> 06:35.033
then you develop all

59
06:35.100 --> 06:40.000
kinds of complications of the right
side also, as you develop on the left side.

60
06:40.100 --> 06:44.467
And the right side problems these days are very, very common,

61
06:44.567 --> 06:49.267
which I have seen people cannot get over.

62
06:49.367 --> 06:56.234
So many diseases like Alzheimer and other diseases come up, later on.

63
06:56.334 --> 07:00.400
First it starts with the liver.

64
07:00.501 --> 07:09.601
The liver is the main point, as we fall into the trap of the liver.

65
07:11.167 --> 07:17.701
If you are thinking too much, if you
are futuristic, if you are aggressive,

66
07:17.801 --> 07:21.167
then the liver goes out

67
07:21.267 --> 07:25.200
because you use liver’s power to do all that.

68
07:25.300 --> 07:30.601
And when your liver power is over, you are finished with liver power,

69
07:30.701 --> 07:34.000
you can develop so many diseases,

70
07:34.100 --> 07:39.767
so many troubles that you cannot overcome it, it’s very difficult.

71
07:40.033 --> 07:46.167
Of course, with Sahaja Yoga, so many
people’s liver has been cured; so many people.

72
07:46.267 --> 07:53.467
And it has been doing wonderful work as far as the liver is concerned,

73
07:53.567 --> 08:00.300
but one should humble down and try to keep the liver alright.

74
08:00.400 --> 08:05.100
So the protection is also built-in your body

75
08:05.200 --> 08:15.467
by Ganas on the left hand side and
by reactions on the right hand side.

76
08:15.567 --> 08:20.501
But the greatest thing is the blessings of the Mother:

77
08:20.601 --> 08:25.400
the way She looks after you, the way She loves you

78
08:25.501 --> 08:30.400
and the way She cares for you – which
you should never take it for granted!

79
08:30.501 --> 08:37.200
You must meditate, you must meditate, it’s very important.

80
08:37.300 --> 08:42.734
No question! Without meditation you can[not] keep yourself alright.

81
08:43.000 --> 08:45.701
it’s no question.

82
08:45.801 --> 08:51.801
Meditation is the most important thing which must be followed

83
08:52.067 --> 08:56.300
because that’s how you come close to Her vibrations,

84
08:56.400 --> 09:02.501
come to Her – I should say to Her nature.

85
09:02.601 --> 09:08.167
Even animals are so sensitive to Mother, very sensitive to vibrations.

86
09:08.267 --> 09:12.801
Animals are, but human beings have their own understanding,

87
09:13.067 --> 09:20.400
have their own freedom, have their so-called intelligence

88
09:20.501 --> 09:28.334
and they fall a trap to it; they follow
things which they should not have.

89
09:28.434 --> 09:33.167
So what is necessary very much, in the country like America,

90
09:33.267 --> 09:37.367
is the devotion and bhakti.

91
09:37.467 --> 09:40.033
These two things are not there.

92
09:40.133 --> 09:43.801
Indians take to Sahaja Yoga and go deep down into it

93
09:44.067 --> 09:47.701
because they know what is bhakti, what is devotion.

94
09:47.801 --> 09:51.367
All this ego and all that melts away.

95
09:51.467 --> 09:54.467
But this bhakti is to be enjoyed.

96
09:54.567 --> 10:00.133
I don’t know how to create bhakti within you – that I can’t say.

97
10:00.234 --> 10:04.400
But I have seen people with bhakti,

98
10:04.501 --> 10:09.467
they have achieved great heights, though it’s a left side movement.

99
10:09.567 --> 10:13.567
With the left side movement they have achieved great heights.

100
10:13.667 --> 10:20.133
I don’t know how the bhakti (devotion) and
shraddha (faith) has helped them so much.

101
10:20.234 --> 10:25.400
In this, I must say, Indians are the best

102
10:25.501 --> 10:32.033
because they have this power of bhakti and of shraddha.

103
10:32.133 --> 10:36.200
It’s not madness, it’s not madness as they have here:

104
10:36.300 --> 10:42.133
I have seen people who get into some
sort of a cult or something, they go mad.

105
10:42.234 --> 10:48.601
It’s not madness, bhakti is love, and love which is understanding,

106
10:48.701 --> 10:53.701
which understands what is bhakti and shraddha.

107
10:53.801 --> 10:58.200
Unless and until you develop that bhakti and shraddha within you,

108
10:58.300 --> 11:05.100
you cannot rise, you cannot rise above your problems,

109
11:05.200 --> 11:12.100
you cannot rise above your personality because

110
11:14.634 --> 11:23.200
bhakti is something you cannot impose
on anyone, you cannot force on anybody.

111
11:23.300 --> 11:31.267
You can make somebody mad and
say that he can do bhakti, [but] he cannot.

112
11:31.367 --> 11:39.133
You have to have all your qualities absolutely intact:

113
11:39.234 --> 11:44.667
you should be intelligent, you should be
understanding – everything should be there,

114
11:44.767 --> 11:50.400
but at that time the joy of bhakti is within you.

115
11:50.501 --> 11:55.033
And this joy of bhakti when it starts flowing,

116
11:55.133 --> 12:00.667
the Goddess Herself enters into your being, I should say.

117
12:00.767 --> 12:05.367
I have seen people, bhaktas, many great saints in India

118
12:05.467 --> 12:11.000
who achieved a lot of height. They’ve gone too far into it.

119
12:11.100 --> 12:17.767
And if you read about them and, if you understand them,

120
12:18.033 --> 12:23.801
you are amazed how, without any help, without any guidance,

121
12:24.067 --> 12:29.334
how could they go that deep and worship Devi.

122
12:29.434 --> 12:34.133
Worshipping is not just out of sheer reading

123
12:34.234 --> 12:37.567
or some sort of a chanting or anything,

124
12:37.667 --> 12:45.734
but it’s the deep attention of your heart;

125
12:46.000 --> 12:48.334
I think it’s Spirit.

126
12:48.434 --> 12:52.400
If the Spirit is awakened within you, you develop the bhakti

127
12:52.501 --> 12:55.434
and drop out all nonsensical ideas,

128
12:55.534 --> 12:59.601
all different things that have crawled into your head,

129
12:59.701 --> 13:02.567
but you just develop the bhakti.

130
13:02.667 --> 13:07.367
Now all these qualities described,
of the Devi [that] are left sided, are in

131
13:07.400 --> 13:09.033
the brain:

132
13:09.133 --> 13:13.501
memory, ‘smruti rupena sansthita’.

133
13:13.601 --> 13:17.667
Other things also – whatever are described – are in the brain.

134
13:17.767 --> 13:24.467
And then the bhakti reaches the stage
[where] it just neutralises everything.

135
13:24.567 --> 13:31.000
All the problems of the brain are
neutralised and you become a wise person.

136
13:31.100 --> 13:37.033
So the greatest boon of the Devi is to give you wisdom.

137
13:37.133 --> 13:44.267
You can call it awareness, you can call it
anything but it’s a kind of a wisdom by which

138
13:44.367 --> 13:50.100
you become absolutely a Divine personality.

139
13:50.200 --> 13:53.667
That wisdom you must reach through your bhakti.

140
13:53.767 --> 13:57.434
But, you see, we have people of all kinds:

141
13:57.534 --> 14:03.567
some are very much in the shraddha, in the bhakti, in the devotion

142
14:03.667 --> 14:08.133
but they are wrongly placed and they don’t understand

143
14:08.234 --> 14:12.634
to whom we should worship and where we should go.

144
14:12.734 --> 14:17.100
Now Sahaja Yoga is a actualisation,

145
14:17.200 --> 14:21.601
Sahaja Yoga is a Sakshat, is actualisation,

146
14:21.701 --> 14:27.467
in which you know whom to worship and whom to surrender,

147
14:27.567 --> 14:30.334
it’s not blind, in any way.

148
14:30.434 --> 14:34.667
Whatever is blind bhakti can take you to any kind of nonsense

149
14:34.767 --> 14:39.033
and that’s how many cults have come
up, many [of] these things have come up,

150
14:39.133 --> 14:48.267
but that’s not a thing that sees, that knows, that understands.

151
14:48.367 --> 14:51.601
It should be understood by your intelligence,

152
14:51.701 --> 14:58.067
by all your qualities – what is your bhakti is like.

153
14:58.167 --> 15:04.234
Now we have, through Kundalini awakening,
reached a very great height I must say

154
15:04.334 --> 15:10.501
of understanding of bhakti, the power of bhakti .

155
15:10.601 --> 15:18.801
The greatest power of bhakti is that it protects you, it protects you.

156
15:19.067 --> 15:27.567
Those people who are suffering from
any kind of trouble, any kind of problems,

157
15:27.667 --> 15:34.000
just get out of it because this bhakti of yours

158
15:34.100 --> 15:41.667
gives you the right type of understanding,
the understanding of your Self;

159
15:41.767 --> 15:47.467
also the understanding of surroundings,
understanding of the whole Universe,

160
15:47.501 --> 15:49.434
I should say,

161
15:49.534 --> 15:52.634
why people behave like this, why they are like this,

162
15:52.734 --> 15:57.300
all this can be solved through your bhakti.

163
15:57.400 --> 16:02.667
It should not be blind, it should not
be blind, but it should be wise bhakti,

164
16:02.701 --> 16:04.534
wise with wisdom.

165
16:04.634 --> 16:07.234
Only possible through Sahaja Yoga, I think,

166
16:07.334 --> 16:11.734
otherwise, whatever bhakti people do like mad, that cannot be bhakti.

167
16:12.000 --> 16:16.234
You don’t become mad, you become a wise man,

168
16:16.334 --> 16:23.267
wise man as we had so many in the past.

169
16:23.367 --> 16:28.767
And the way they have talked about everything is surprising.

170
16:29.033 --> 16:34.567
How they have said things about human awareness,

171
16:34.667 --> 16:38.501
about your ascent is remarkable

172
16:38.601 --> 16:43.467
and sometimes I feel that they have really prepared a field for me,

173
16:43.567 --> 16:48.634
a proper area for me, to talk to people.

174
16:48.734 --> 16:54.434
Especially in India, I don’t know why, traditionally

175
16:54.534 --> 17:00.534
we are very, traditionally we are very much devoted people.

176
17:00.634 --> 17:03.801
In the same way all over it should happen.

177
17:04.067 --> 17:08.701
Because, in India of course there are mad people also,

178
17:08.801 --> 17:12.334
there are cults, there are all kinds of things, no doubt,

179
17:12.434 --> 17:18.000
but actually there we have saints who have guided us very well.

180
17:18.100 --> 17:22.300
Despite that you find in India people are going astray,

181
17:22.400 --> 17:26.767
doing wrong things and wrong type of worshipping.

182
17:27.033 --> 17:29.534
This is true, no doubt,

183
17:29.634 --> 17:41.434
but it is I should say just a funny type
of a madness, where there is no wisdom.

184
17:41.534 --> 17:48.234
What is [the difference] between a mad and a
sane person is, that a mad person has no wisdom.

185
17:48.334 --> 17:50.801
And those who have also so-called wisdom,

186
17:51.067 --> 17:55.567
or so they say, that “we are very wise,” are sadly mistaken.

187
17:55.667 --> 18:00.200
Because the way they behave, the way they commit mistakes,

188
18:00.300 --> 18:07.601
the way their whole attention is, I should say the whole working is,

189
18:07.701 --> 18:12.567
is sometimes surprising but [it’s] because they have no wisdom.

190
18:12.701 --> 18:19.234
First of all is, to test yourself you must see, “Am I wise?

191
18:19.334 --> 18:24.801
Am I wise? Do I do wise things or I’m not doing?”

192
18:25.067 --> 18:29.200
So many complaints come to me, about Sahaja Yogis also.

193
18:29.300 --> 18:32.701
I am surprised, why: why are they doing like that?

194
18:32.801 --> 18:37.434
I would say, still, they have not reached the state of bhakti.

195
18:37.534 --> 18:43.601
Bhakti and shraddha, these two things
are missing in the Western life, I must say.

196
18:43.701 --> 18:48.100
We should come back, we should develop, we should grow.

197
18:48.200 --> 18:52.167
But, even in the Eastern life now it’s missing.

198
18:52.267 --> 18:55.367
For them the ideal is now the Western life.

199
18:55.467 --> 19:05.501
Once you take to Western life, that part is
over because the whole thing is judged with ideas:

200
19:05.601 --> 19:13.634
what is beneficial, what is helpful in life.

201
19:13.734 --> 19:21.434
But bhakti and shraddha, according
to them, is of no use, that doesn’t help.

202
19:21.534 --> 19:24.567
Most of the people nowadays think like that

203
19:24.667 --> 19:31.167
but you are very few who have understood
what is bhakti and what is shraddha.

204
19:31.267 --> 19:35.801
So, I would say, the Goddess gives you bhakti and shraddha.

205
19:36.067 --> 19:38.067
By what?

206
19:38.167 --> 19:42.167
She gives you through your meditation;

207
19:42.267 --> 19:46.801
that you see so many miracles
happening in your life and you are amazed.

208
19:47.067 --> 19:51.467
“How this has happened? We never expected this to happen.

209
19:51.567 --> 19:55.200
How it has happened, how it has worked out?”

210
19:55.300 --> 20:01.167
Also She corrects you. All the time, if you are aware,

211
20:01.267 --> 20:06.400
She corrects you and tells you, “Don’t go
this way! You are going on the ego side.”

212
20:06.501 --> 20:09.501
Or She’ll tell you, “You are going on the left side.”

213
20:09.601 --> 20:12.300
She’s the one who corrects, throughout.

214
20:12.400 --> 20:17.667
We get into diseases and we are trapped into all kinds of things;

215
20:17.767 --> 20:23.200
it is because we don’t have bhakti.

216
20:23.300 --> 20:28.133
In the bhakti, you have to depend on the wisdom of the Mother,

217
20:28.234 --> 20:32.701
wisdom of the Shakti, that She looks after you,

218
20:32.801 --> 20:37.133
She finds you out the way and She will help you.

219
20:37.234 --> 20:40.133
If you start becoming on your own

220
20:40.234 --> 20:44.467
and thinking that, “I am alright, I
can do this, I can do that,” you will find

221
20:44.567 --> 20:48.200
inevitably that you are wrong,

222
20:48.300 --> 20:54.300
that you had a very wrong idea about yourself and about the Divine.

223
20:54.400 --> 21:01.467
So, what is the most important point is
surrendering. The word ‘Islam’ means surrender.

224
21:01.567 --> 21:08.467
But Mohammed Sahib has described what you
should have before surrender is your Realisation.

225
21:08.567 --> 21:15.234
But, you have seen, even after
Realisation people take time to settle down.

226
21:15.334 --> 21:16.467
But once you

227
21:16.501 --> 21:20.167
are settled down you understand that
you are under a protection of the Goddess,

228
21:20.267 --> 21:26.067
that you see every day how it works and how it helps you.

229
21:26.167 --> 21:32.534
Many people who are in Sahaja Yoga,
so-called, have great respect for me

230
21:32.634 --> 21:36.667
but are not fully there; then they suffer

231
21:36.767 --> 21:39.300
and they have problems and then they ask me,

232
21:39.400 --> 21:42.667
“Mother, how is it I have got this problem?” I don’t tell them,

233
21:42.767 --> 21:47.133
because you can’t tell anything to human
beings, you see, they are very aggressive.

234
21:47.234 --> 21:56.801
But, the fact is because you are not one with the Divine.

235
21:57.067 --> 22:02.200
And with the Divine if you are one, you’ll
have nothing but compassion and love,

236
22:02.300 --> 22:03.801
nothing else.

237
22:04.067 --> 22:07.467
And everything you will do so smoothly, so nicely.

238
22:07.567 --> 22:09.067
People may not

239
22:09.133 --> 22:13.434
understand, like they crucified Christ,
they did all kind of things -agreed.

240
22:13.534 --> 22:18.767
But now, you should ask for the protection of the Goddess

241
22:19.033 --> 22:23.634
because that is the greatest quality
of the Goddess, that She protects you

242
22:23.734 --> 22:31.701
from all problems, from all troubles, from all kinds of nonsensical

243
22:31.801 --> 22:35.567
I should say things that can happen to you.

244
22:35.667 --> 22:38.734
And there are so many things that happen.

245
22:39.000 --> 22:44.534
I tell you, I was told that one of the
leaders of Sahaja Yogi was killed.

246
22:44.634 --> 22:53.567
I said, “Not possible!” And the fellow was in Rome, he was not killed.

247
22:53.667 --> 22:58.367
So, it’s not possible that a young man should be killed like that.

248
22:58.467 --> 23:00.767
Of course, if somebody is old you have to die,

249
23:01.033 --> 23:04.267
but that he was killed, was not a right thing.

250
23:04.367 --> 23:09.033
So it is the protection, not only physical, mental, emotional,

251
23:09.133 --> 23:11.534
but spiritual protection comes to you.

252
23:11.634 --> 23:17.133
Spiritual protection in that what you
do is that you don’t do wrong things.

253
23:17.234 --> 23:22.434
You don’t kill anybody, you don’t torture
anybody, you are not rude to anybody.

254
23:22.534 --> 23:29.567
That is the situation into which you all
can enter because you are Sahaja Yogis.

255
23:29.667 --> 23:33.501
You can achieve it. You have a power to do it

256
23:33.601 --> 23:40.133
because you have so much shraddha and so much understanding

257
23:40.234 --> 23:47.534
that you have reached a certain
state of protection, of growth of wisdom.

258
23:47.634 --> 23:52.133
Now first test your wisdom, you must test your wisdom,

259
23:52.234 --> 23:57.634
“If I am doing this, is this wise, is it good, why I am doing it?”

260
23:57.734 --> 24:02.434
First test your wisdom, then you’ll find out that many things you do

261
24:02.534 --> 24:06.000
which are wrong, which should not have been done.

262
24:06.100 --> 24:13.167
But first your wisdom must develop and you
must see that your wisdom works and helps you.

263
24:13.267 --> 24:17.133
I have seen now, yesterday’s drama, you must have seen that girl

264
24:17.234 --> 24:23.100
she is very sensitive and she could
see through her wisdom what was good.

265
24:23.200 --> 24:27.534
If you cannot find out what is good and what is bad

266
24:27.634 --> 24:31.067
that means the wisdom is lacking.

267
24:31.167 --> 24:37.367
If you cannot find out what should you do then the wisdom is lacking.

268
24:37.467 --> 24:45.367
But, if you have the wisdom, then you
will immediately know that this is wrong.

269
24:45.467 --> 24:50.267
Apart from that, you’ll be saved from all kinds of problems.

270
24:50.367 --> 24:55.667
It’s a fact, I have seen with so many
people like that, who have been saved,

271
24:55.767 --> 25:02.434
not only from death, but from all kinds of catastrophes, all kinds.

272
25:02.534 --> 25:08.667
And I was amazed how these Sahaja Yogis are helped by the Divine.

273
25:08.767 --> 25:14.334
Divine is a power, everywhere it exists.

274
25:14.434 --> 25:19.701
But it will only help the people who are Sahaj Yogis, who are divine,

275
25:19.801 --> 25:23.701
not the people who are not, it will never help you,

276
25:23.801 --> 25:29.801
on the contrary it might punish in a way that is never expected.

277
25:30.067 --> 25:36.267
So, one has to be careful to test
oneself, what I call ‘introspection’:

278
25:36.367 --> 25:40.367
Have you been wise in dealing with certain problems?

279
25:40.467 --> 25:42.434
What has been your style?

280
25:42.534 --> 25:46.667
Is it money oriented or it is domination oriented.

281
25:46.767 --> 25:52.033
What sort of a power it was that you were working under?

282
25:52.133 --> 25:54.801
You have to introspect to find out.

283
25:55.067 --> 25:58.434
And you will be amazed, very much amazed,

284
25:58.534 --> 26:03.234
that even in the name of God you can do wrong things.

285
26:03.334 --> 26:06.767
Lots of wrong things have been done in the name of God and that’s why

286
26:07.033 --> 26:11.200
today we have such a big chaos of so called ‘religions’,

287
26:11.300 --> 26:15.000
when nothing wrong was religion, was with the religion as such,

288
26:15.100 --> 26:18.601
and those religious people who talked about it – nothing wrong –

289
26:18.701 --> 26:23.100
but the way people absorbed it and the way people used it was wrong.

290
26:23.200 --> 26:26.067
Because [what] they lacked is wisdom.

291
26:26.167 --> 26:31.267
And the wisdom is the thing which really is not just assumption

292
26:31.367 --> 26:33.367
that, “I am very wise and all that,”

293
26:33.501 --> 26:40.367
but it asserts, it works out and it
shows what is good and what is bad.

294
26:40.467 --> 26:48.667
Wisdom is the sign of a person who is
really a realised soul of a very high level.

295
26:48.767 --> 26:53.267
If you don’t have wisdom whatever you may do,

296
26:53.367 --> 26:59.033
you might feel satisfied about it, but
the wisdom part is very, very important.

297
26:59.133 --> 27:03.501
That is the most governing part within us and as you know,

298
27:03.601 --> 27:09.467
Ganesha is the giver of wisdom.

299
27:09.567 --> 27:14.200
That’s why Ganesha must be worshipped.

300
27:26.167 --> 27:29.767
With a proper upbringing

301
27:33.133 --> 27:40.467
Shri Ganesha is established, who is nothing but the giver of wisdom.

302
27:44.133 --> 27:50.234
And this wisdom is innate. You don’t have to judge it,

303
27:50.334 --> 27:56.367
it’s innate within us, grown up, just like any other qualities in us.

304
27:56.467 --> 28:02.801
It takes time with some people, it takes time, no doubt.

305
28:03.801 --> 28:16.300
But once it comes in, such a person
becomes quiet, simple and absolutely truthful.

306
28:16.400 --> 28:20.667
He knows about everything.

307
28:20.767 --> 28:27.200
And this is the thing one should develop is, “How far am I wise?”

308
28:27.300 --> 28:31.367
You see, in this world people are
protesting for this, protesting for that,

309
28:31.467 --> 28:36.067
fighting for this, doing all kinds of things.

310
28:36.167 --> 28:42.167
But if you have wisdom, then you
don’t have to do anything of the kind!

311
28:42.267 --> 28:49.267
What happens is that automatically
people understand that he’s a wise man.

312
28:49.367 --> 28:54.033
From ancient times everywhere a wise man has been praised.

313
28:54.133 --> 29:00.400
He’s not worried about his financial side, or emotional side, nothing!

314
29:00.501 --> 29:05.767
What he is worried is, “Have I been a wise person?”

315
29:06.033 --> 29:10.334
That is the first sign of the blessings of God.

316
29:10.434 --> 29:16.133
The one who has blessings of Divine is a wise person,

317
29:16.234 --> 29:21.133
he’s very wise and his wisdom is shown by his silence.

318
29:21.234 --> 29:25.467
And the Whole Power, the Divine Power,

319
29:25.567 --> 29:31.667
uses that person as a media and works tremendously.

320
29:31.767 --> 29:36.634
That man himself is surprised how it has helped him.

321
29:36.734 --> 29:39.801
A woman can have that, a man can have it,

322
29:40.067 --> 29:45.701
anybody can have that wisdom, that profoundness, that temperament

323
29:45.801 --> 29:54.133
which is so beautiful and so empowering.

324
29:54.234 --> 29:56.434
Such

325
29:56.467 --> 30:03.300
a person doesn’t curse anyone, doesn’t
bother to curse anyone, but it works.

326
30:03.400 --> 30:08.334
He never gets angry with anyone, but it works.

327
30:10.634 --> 30:17.434
He doesn’t lose temper, no, but some temper works

328
30:17.534 --> 30:23.100
and harms you which you never expected.

329
30:23.200 --> 30:30.267
It is within us, within our power as human beings, to be wise.

330
30:30.367 --> 30:36.367
I have seen animals have such a
sensitivity to vibrations, extremely sensitive.

331
30:36.467 --> 30:40.601
How? Because their wisdom is intact.

332
30:40.701 --> 30:44.100
It works in them, they are not conscious of it.

333
30:44.200 --> 30:52.200
The difference is, human beings are conscious
of their wisdom, that’s the only difference.

334
30:52.300 --> 30:56.534
Animals have wisdom, but automatic, we should say, natural.

335
30:56.634 --> 31:05.467
But we have inculcated this, or we have
developed this wisdom within us, through what?

336
31:05.567 --> 31:13.434
Through our meditation, through our
understanding of bhakti and shraddha.

337
31:13.534 --> 31:21.467
So it’s very important to understand the value of bhakti within us.

338
31:21.567 --> 31:28.334
You cannot superficially touch it.
Those who are superficial will never get it.

339
31:28.434 --> 31:39.300
Wisdom only comes through understanding what is wisdom is.

340
31:39.400 --> 31:42.334
You might find somebody extremely wise,

341
31:42.434 --> 31:46.634
he may be your servant, may be your driver, may be anyone.

342
31:46.734 --> 31:51.634
And you are amazed how such a person can be so wise.

343
31:51.734 --> 31:57.067
Because, maybe from his last life, he has got it within him,

344
31:57.167 --> 32:01.167
or he has gone into it and he found it.

345
32:02.734 --> 32:08.367
It’s not the estate of one person, it’s not the property of one person

346
32:08.467 --> 32:11.734
but it can belong to many of them.

347
32:12.000 --> 32:17.000
So the Sahaj Yogi is the one who has to have that wisdom,

348
32:17.100 --> 32:20.067
“Why I am doing this? What is the need to do it?”

349
32:20.167 --> 32:24.334
They don’t have to ask any questions, they just don’t do wrong things.

350
32:24.434 --> 32:27.167
They just don’t do wrong things.

351
32:27.267 --> 32:29.634
They are always on the right path.

352
32:29.734 --> 32:36.367
That is the sign of a Sahaj Yogi, I believe,
and which is the blessing of the Goddess.

353
32:36.467 --> 32:40.267
If there is the Power of the Goddess working in you,

354
32:40.367 --> 32:43.601
you will have the wisdom to work it out.

355
32:43.701 --> 32:48.567
Now you have seen many people
coming to America, doing all kinds of things.

356
32:48.667 --> 32:51.767
They all have disappeared. There’s no support to them.

357
32:52.033 --> 32:54.234
Where are they? They are finished.

358
32:54.334 --> 32:59.400
Because they were money oriented, or power
oriented, I don’t know what they were oriented!

359
32:59.501 --> 33:01.400
And they have lost it.

360
33:01.501 --> 33:07.534
But for a person who is standing in his wisdom,

361
33:07.634 --> 33:12.167
is the sage as they call him, is the saint as they call it.

362
33:12.267 --> 33:17.667
But, this can be every Sahaja Yogi could be a saint,

363
33:17.767 --> 33:22.033
could be a sage, every Sahaja Yogi could be that.

364
33:22.133 --> 33:27.300
But if you lose your wisdom then you are no good.

365
33:27.400 --> 33:33.534
So, I have to tell you one thing:
it’s your wisdom which will save you.

366
33:33.634 --> 33:40.000
Your wisdom will unconsciously help you.

367
33:40.100 --> 33:46.501
There was one gentleman, Sahaj Yogi,
once he was going somewhere in the car

368
33:46.601 --> 33:52.267
and suddenly decided to go on to another road, suddenly.

369
33:52.367 --> 33:56.234
And what happened, that on that road there was a very big accident

370
33:56.334 --> 33:59.367
and he would have been in that accident.

371
33:59.467 --> 34:03.133
Like that there are many incidents people have told me, that,

372
34:03.234 --> 34:05.567
“Mother, how we were saved,

373
34:05.667 --> 34:15.534
how we were brought to the brink of
death and then how we are just alive.”

374
34:15.634 --> 34:21.701
It is because the Divine needs you, Divine doesn’t want you to die,

375
34:21.801 --> 34:24.601
or to finish off, it needs you very much.

376
34:24.701 --> 34:29.634
It has to do its work and you are the instrument of that Divine.

377
34:29.734 --> 34:38.000
If you have wisdom you are the best
instrument for the Divine to work it out.

378
34:38.100 --> 34:43.000
The devi’s powers first of all existed in Her body only

379
34:43.100 --> 34:51.267
and She killed so many rakshasas
and evil people – She did, kill it, actually.

380
34:51.367 --> 34:57.067
But now, there’s no need because you
all are there and you are the instruments.

381
34:57.167 --> 35:03.133
And it will all work out in such a way that
all those people who are trying to destroy

382
35:03.234 --> 35:08.801
the goodness, trying to destroy wise people,

383
35:09.067 --> 35:14.167
they will be killed, they’ll be finished, they’ll be destroyed.

384
35:14.267 --> 35:19.200
This is not to be done through any outside instrument or anything.

385
35:19.300 --> 35:24.501
It’s your wisdom, is the biggest instrument that will work it out.

386
35:24.601 --> 35:29.767
Do you know, when I came to America
first, I saw such a horrible thing here:

387
35:30.033 --> 35:33.634
that people were running after some horrible ‘gurus’

388
35:33.734 --> 35:36.667
and I never came [again], after nine years I came.

389
35:36.767 --> 35:39.267
Because I said, “These people are mad!

390
35:39.367 --> 35:43.133
How do they follow these horrible
people? And why do they believe into it?

391
35:43.234 --> 35:47.400
They have no wisdom to understand what is the Truth is like.”

392
35:47.501 --> 35:52.300
And it works out, now, today, you
can see there are so many people here.

393
35:52.400 --> 35:55.234
So, that is what is the wisdom part.

394
35:55.334 --> 36:00.100
And if this wisdom comes to Americans they’ll come to Sahaja Yoga.

395
36:00.200 --> 36:03.367
Not only come, but they will grow into it.

396
36:03.467 --> 36:06.200
But the wisdom will be to see,

397
36:06.300 --> 36:11.367
“What are we going to do, what are we going to get, what is our aim?”

398
36:11.467 --> 36:16.267
All these things must be brought to them, which is not done normally.

399
36:16.367 --> 36:20.067
We must talk to them, and we must tell them that,

400
36:20.167 --> 36:23.334
“What is within you is the Spirit.

401
36:23.434 --> 36:27.067
You should become the Spirit, every one of them has said so.

402
36:27.167 --> 36:31.300
So why not do that? And why not become the Spirit?”

403
36:31.400 --> 36:35.434
So, then they will themselves feel,

404
36:35.534 --> 36:40.267
“Yes, that’s true. It is said that you should become the Spirit.”

405
36:40.367 --> 36:45.000
They’ll go to Church, they’ll go to temples, they’ll go here, there,

406
36:45.100 --> 36:48.000
not understanding why they are doing it?

407
36:48.100 --> 36:52.000
They need some sort of a protection, that’s why they go,

408
36:52.100 --> 36:56.400
but this protection comes from your spiritual status,

409
36:56.501 --> 37:00.801
where do you stand as far as the Spirit is concerned.

410
37:01.067 --> 37:03.667
Those who have enjoyed the Spirit,

411
37:03.767 --> 37:08.801
I have seen do not deviate from the right path. But those who haven’t,

412
37:09.067 --> 37:14.267
they may call themselves Sahaj Yogis,
anything, but they can be very wrong.

413
37:14.367 --> 37:22.000
So, first of all, find out about
yourself. If you are a real Sahaj Yogi,

414
37:22.100 --> 37:28.033
if you really want to be an instrument of This Power,

415
37:28.133 --> 37:35.234
then, what you have to do is to become
full of bhakti and shraddha for that.

416
37:35.334 --> 37:40.234
And this bhakti and shraddha is very joy giving, I know that.

417
37:40.334 --> 37:46.367
It never makes you tired, it never troubles you, nothing!

418
37:46.467 --> 37:50.567
But it’s very nourishing and beautiful.

419
37:50.667 --> 37:57.167
But it should be at the right place with
the right aims and right understanding.

420
37:57.267 --> 38:01.300
For all that what you need again is wisdom.

421
38:01.400 --> 38:09.367
And you should try to find out – are you
wise enough? Are you wise, or are you not?

422
38:09.467 --> 38:15.634
It’s very difficult for every human being
to find out whether you are right or wrong

423
38:15.734 --> 38:21.467
because, you see the effects of this wisdom all around.

424
38:21.567 --> 38:30.300
So, the bhakti and shraddha to the Goddess
gives you, definitely gives you, wisdom.

425
38:30.400 --> 38:37.467
We have had some people in India who did lots of bhakti, so called,

426
38:37.567 --> 38:40.100
and showed lots of shraddha,

427
38:40.200 --> 38:43.634
but they were not, they were not.

428
38:43.734 --> 38:49.133
Just they were talking about it, or doing all kinds of things about it

429
38:49.234 --> 38:50.400
but they were not.

430
38:50.501 --> 38:52.033
So

431
38:52.100 --> 38:56.501
wisdom is something a very innate
quality, very innate, it’s not superficial.

432
38:56.601 --> 39:01.400
You cannot just say that this person is wise or not.

433
39:01.501 --> 39:06.601
It shows, that’s just like a power, it’s a power of understanding

434
39:06.701 --> 39:10.767
and is supported by the Power of the Goddess.

435
39:11.033 --> 39:16.567
So She is the giver of wisdom. This
is the biggest quality of the Goddess,

436
39:16.667 --> 39:19.067
that She is the giver of wisdom.

437
39:19.167 --> 39:23.434
And wisdom comes as a part of the evolutionary process.

438
39:23.534 --> 39:27.801
Now She has brought about all the evolution so far, and to go further

439
39:28.067 --> 39:32.234
She is going to make you a very wise person.

440
39:32.334 --> 39:36.133
Even an ordinary sage in a village,

441
39:36.234 --> 39:41.300
in a far-fetched places is respected if he is a real sage.

442
39:41.400 --> 39:45.601
But, [if] he is a stupid fellow, what can you do?

443
39:45.701 --> 39:50.400
He may befool you, may do all kind of tricks and things like that.

444
39:50.501 --> 39:57.267
And then, does he get anything good for you? No, nothing.

445
39:57.367 --> 40:03.601
So first thing is: anybody who is
supposed to be your guru or supposed to be

446
40:03.701 --> 40:09.434
the person who is guiding you, must
have bhakti, bhakti of the Goddess.

447
40:09.534 --> 40:11.434
It’s very important to understand.

448
40:11.534 --> 40:17.667
Modern things have such, come to such a
limit, that they have no respect for the Goddess, no,

449
40:17.767 --> 40:20.100
they don’t even talk about the Goddess

450
40:20.200 --> 40:25.200
and they just talk about something
which cannot be explained and understood.

451
40:25.300 --> 40:28.200
If they talk about Christ they won’t talk about Him,

452
40:28.300 --> 40:33.467
that He is the one who said at the cross, “Behold the Mother”.

453
40:33.567 --> 40:37.133
What was the need to say that?

454
40:37.234 --> 40:40.434
Because He didn’t want His Mother to get into trouble,

455
40:40.534 --> 40:43.267
but He said, “Behold The Mother,”

456
40:43.367 --> 40:47.634
that means, “Look out for the Mother who is going to come.”

457
40:47.734 --> 40:50.501
They all have indicated and they have said so.

458
40:50.601 --> 40:54.534
But still we are busy with our own ego

459
40:54.634 --> 41:00.400
and our own understanding and we run after things which are not real.

460
41:00.501 --> 41:07.367
First of all you must follow only
thing that is real, not unreal things.

461
41:07.467 --> 41:10.133
For that also, again, you need wisdom.

462
41:10.234 --> 41:13.467
I think for that you need wisdom very much more.

463
41:13.567 --> 41:16.501
And that is something, whether you have the wisdom first,

464
41:16.601 --> 41:22.234
or you have the blessings of the Mother, is between the two.

465
41:22.334 --> 41:30.400
So I have to tell you one thing that: before
you people start spreading Sahaja Yoga,

466
41:30.501 --> 41:35.534
please judge yourself. Just see if you are wise enough.

467
41:35.634 --> 41:40.133
Also see for yourself if you have the blessings of the Mother.

468
41:40.234 --> 41:47.701
Only the wise are, I should say, the people who know

469
41:47.801 --> 41:52.434
whether they have the Mother’s blessings or not.

470
41:52.534 --> 41:56.567
For that we have so many ways of understanding.

471
41:56.667 --> 41:59.367
First and foremost thing is meditation

472
41:59.467 --> 42:09.033
and feeling your vibrations on the
photograph and facing yourself clearly.

473
42:09.133 --> 42:14.501
If you are a realised soul, are you
really a good realised soul or not?

474
42:14.601 --> 42:20.000
Are you deep or not? Are your vibrations working out or not?

475
42:20.100 --> 42:28.300
If you can see that then you will
realise that greater than all ambitions,

476
42:28.400 --> 42:38.400
the greatest is to become a devoted, wise personality.

477
42:38.501 --> 42:44.601
That is the one that will give you
the joy, joy for all kinds of things.

478
42:44.701 --> 42:50.634
Otherwise it is just a human being like others going about.

479
42:50.734 --> 42:56.334
Now the time has come for this to
work out. It’s a special time, I should say.

480
42:56.434 --> 42:59.567
Although, quite a lot of struggle for me, no doubt,

481
42:59.667 --> 43:04.167
but doesn’t matter, I know, because I have landed myself in the area

482
43:04.267 --> 43:07.734
where things are not so simple, it doesn’t matter.

483
43:08.000 --> 43:13.467
But, on the whole, what I feel is you can support me very much,

484
43:13.567 --> 43:18.501
you can support my work very much, if you have that wisdom.

485
43:18.601 --> 43:21.400
And the wisdom is to judge yourself:

486
43:21.501 --> 43:24.734
how many people you love? How you love?

487
43:25.000 --> 43:30.434
How you talk to them? What do you
want out of them? All this should come.

488
43:30.534 --> 43:35.200
Judge yourself – introspection. Through introspection you can see it.

489
43:35.300 --> 43:40.467
So, for a Sahaja Yogi is important is introspection.

490
43:40.567 --> 43:44.434
Second one is meditation.

491
43:44.534 --> 43:48.367
And third one is to take vibrations.

492
43:48.467 --> 43:49.734
It’s very important.

493
43:49.767 --> 43:54.033
What I find, some of them say, “Mother,
we don’t do this, we don’t do that,”

494
43:54.133 --> 43:56.167
“But why? Why not do it?”

495
43:56.267 --> 43:59.133
“We do Sahaja Yoga!” Sahaja Yoga, which part?

496
43:59.234 --> 44:03.801
If you are not doing these basic things, how are you a Sahaja Yogi?

497
44:04.067 --> 44:09.734
And then lots of complications come out of them, they also suffer.

498
44:10.000 --> 44:16.167
I think one has to have again the wisdom
to understand what is Sahaja Yoga is.

499
44:16.267 --> 44:18.634
No one understands that sometimes, and

500
44:18.734 --> 44:21.701
they go on forming a group of people

501
44:21.801 --> 44:26.601
who are not at all understanding what is Sahaja Yoga.

502
44:26.701 --> 44:30.334
It’s a very, very deep personality.

503
44:30.434 --> 44:34.701
Sahaja Yoga is not just by saying, “I am a Sahaja Yogi,”

504
44:34.801 --> 44:41.133
but it’s a very deep personality. And that deep personality

505
44:41.234 --> 44:46.501
has to be felt by others as the wise, very wise thing.

506
44:46.601 --> 44:52.400
Not that how much you talk or shout or give lectures is important;

507
44:52.501 --> 44:54.767
is

508
44:54.801 --> 45:02.033
with peace, the tranquillity, the
capacity to love within you are important.

509
45:02.133 --> 45:09.334
And that’s how people can judge whether
you are really blessed by your Mother or not.

510
45:09.434 --> 45:14.100
So, this is one of the things very important when I’ve come to America

511
45:14.200 --> 45:17.367
just to protect America from problems,

512
45:17.467 --> 45:21.200
because suddenly this has grown into problems.

513
45:21.300 --> 45:27.100
And it was inevitable because they were blind here

514
45:27.200 --> 45:30.400
not to understand what’s going wrong with them

515
45:30.501 --> 45:34.434
and that blindness has brought them to this point

516
45:34.534 --> 45:38.267
that they start seeing their ego specially,

517
45:38.367 --> 45:42.534
which has ruined them – money orientation.

518
45:42.634 --> 45:46.567
All this has shown how stupid they have been to believe

519
45:46.667 --> 45:51.634
that they are very rich people and they can do anything they want to

520
45:51.734 --> 45:58.133
with their money and with overpowering
of other countries and other people.

521
45:58.234 --> 46:01.200
First overpower yourself.

522
46:01.300 --> 46:06.701
You have to know yourself first of all.
What’s the use of overpowering others?

523
46:06.801 --> 46:10.100
Those who do not know how to overpower themselves

524
46:10.200 --> 46:17.400
are always miserable, always in trouble because it reacts.

525
46:17.501 --> 46:21.367
If you try to overpower others, it reacts.

526
46:21.467 --> 46:25.267
For that you have to be absolutely introspecting,

527
46:25.367 --> 46:29.601
again and again I have been saying this that, “Introspect.”

528
46:29.701 --> 46:35.467
Of course, I must say, so many good Sahaj Yogis have come out now

529
46:35.567 --> 46:40.467
and they have worked it out, and
they are very good, simple, wise people.

530
46:40.567 --> 46:46.601
It’s such a great hope for me, I never
expected I will work it out that good.

531
46:46.701 --> 46:53.200
But it has worked out and always, always,
you must know you have That Power within you

532
46:53.300 --> 47:00.267
and that you must use that power
and not fall a prey into nonsensical ideas.

533
47:00.367 --> 47:02.200
Thank you very much.
