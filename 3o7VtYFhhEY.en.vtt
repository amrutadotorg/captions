00:01.563 --> 00:05.813
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:13.063 --> 00:16.188
Some of you have found the truth,

00:17.208 --> 00:22.813
some of you have not found it fully,

00:23.562 --> 00:27.562
and some of you have not found it at all.

00:29.483 --> 00:37.563
But if you look around in today's situation,

00:39.430 --> 00:43.306
you'll have to agree there's a big turmoil going on.

00:45.709 --> 00:48.556
Countries after countries are taking

00:49.306 --> 00:52.430
to all kinds of wrong things.

00:52.931 --> 00:55.806
Lot of cold war is on,

00:57.181 --> 00:59.556
people are killing each other,

01:00.681 --> 01:06.181
destroying beautiful places,

01:09.556 --> 01:13.931
cutting each other's throat for nothing at all.

01:15.430 --> 01:20.806
They are all human beings created by God.

01:21.430 --> 01:24.430
God Almighty has created them

01:24.931 --> 01:28.931
and has brought them to this level of human awareness.

01:31.056 --> 01:32.931
At this juncture

01:34.056 --> 01:38.556
one can't see where are we going in a collective way.

01:43.430 --> 01:48.431
This is, where have we to reach --or

01:49.681 --> 01:52.430
is it our destiny?

01:54.430 --> 01:58.430
Is this the destiny of human beings,

02:00.431 --> 02:02.806
to be destroyed by each other

02:04.681 --> 02:08.056
for land or for anything else?

02:09.306 --> 02:12.806
Think of the whole world as one,

02:14.056 --> 02:17.931
and think what's happening all over:

02:18.306 --> 02:21.056
every day we read newspaper,

02:21.430 --> 02:25.681
every day there is some sort of a horrible news

02:25.931 --> 02:30.181
about horrible things people are doing to each other,

02:30.556 --> 02:32.681
for no rhyme and reason.

02:37.431 --> 02:41.681
We have to think, what is the destiny?

02:43.056 --> 02:45.430
Where are we going?

02:46.681 --> 02:52.806
Are we going to hell or to Heaven?

02:54.931 --> 02:59.431
What is our situation around? Can we help it?

03:03.056 --> 03:05.556
What's wrong with human beings is

03:06.931 --> 03:15.430
they are still in the complete control of ignorance

03:15.806 --> 03:18.430
I would call it ignorance.

03:19.681 --> 03:22.431
And in that ignorance, in that darkness,

03:24.056 --> 03:27.306
they are doing these horrible things.

03:28.431 --> 03:34.306
Nobody wants to understand that what we are doing

03:35.681 --> 03:39.181
is nothing but complete destruction.

03:40.556 --> 03:43.056
Is that our destiny,

03:43.431 --> 03:46.931
that we are going to get destroyed completely?

03:47.931 --> 03:50.806
What good are we doing?

03:52.806 --> 03:57.056
Under the name of some sort of nationality

03:57.430 --> 04:00.306
or maybe some religion

04:00.556 --> 04:04.806
-- all kinds of things which are good --

04:05.430 --> 04:08.430
but we are doing all wrong things.

04:08.681 --> 04:10.556
Fighting.

04:11.056 --> 04:14.306
Fighting is not the only thing.

04:15.430 --> 04:17.056
We hate.

04:19.306 --> 04:23.681
Anybody who can excite our hatred

04:26.181 --> 04:31.181
is very much adorable, very much liked,

04:31.556 --> 04:35.056
and under his guidance we form groups.

04:36.931 --> 04:43.306
All this is coming because this is the Last Judgment.

04:43.681 --> 04:47.681
I have told you this is the Last Judgment.

04:49.181 --> 04:53.430
And this Last Judgment will really decide

04:54.556 --> 04:58.556
who are to be saved and who are to be doomed completely.

04:59.931 --> 05:03.430
It's a very, very serious thing.

05:04.556 --> 05:12.430
All of those who are aware should think about it.

05:13.430 --> 05:15.056
Little patchwork here

05:15.430 --> 05:18.430
and a little patchwork is not going to help.

05:19.430 --> 05:21.430
Whatever you may try,

05:21.806 --> 05:26.430
unless and until you transform human beings,

05:26.681 --> 05:28.806
they cannot be saved.

05:30.681 --> 05:38.306
This transformation is not an impossible thing

05:38.806 --> 05:40.931
-- it's not difficult.

05:41.430 --> 05:44.430
This is the time for transformation,

05:44.806 --> 05:47.430
this is a chance for transformation.

05:47.806 --> 05:53.681
And within us is placed the power,

05:54.806 --> 05:58.056
as Tao has described,

05:58.430 --> 06:01.681
is the mystical feminine Power within us.

06:02.181 --> 06:04.556
All of them have described it,

06:05.931 --> 06:09.056
I'm not the first person to say that;

06:10.681 --> 06:15.430
but nobody has been able perhaps so far

06:17.056 --> 06:21.430
to understand it or to accept it,

06:21.806 --> 06:24.430
that it should happen to you.

06:27.931 --> 06:33.430
You are born not only to be human beings,

06:34.430 --> 06:37.306
but you have to be superhuman.

06:38.430 --> 06:40.431
You have to enjoy yourself.

06:40.931 --> 06:44.556
Your life should be enjoyable, it should be blissful.

06:45.056 --> 06:47.056
It should not be a curse:

06:47.430 --> 06:51.056
morning till evening worried about this, worried about that.

06:53.430 --> 06:56.056
That is why you are created.

06:56.430 --> 07:00.430
God had no intention of creating people

07:00.931 --> 07:04.931
who will be all the time worried how to quarrel,

07:05.306 --> 07:07.306
how to fight, how to save;

07:08.556 --> 07:13.431
but people who will live in complete harmony,

07:14.181 --> 07:16.681
peace and joy.

07:18.806 --> 07:20.806
That's why we are created.

07:21.306 --> 07:24.430
That is our destiny -- that is,

07:24.806 --> 07:27.681
not just I am telling you, but it's a fact.

07:28.306 --> 07:36.431
So we have to be, we have to be transformed.

07:38.056 --> 07:40.556
This transformation is not difficult.

07:41.181 --> 07:48.306
But what I find, people get satisfied with anything

07:49.556 --> 07:52.430
Hindus will go to the temple;

07:52.556 --> 07:55.181
they'll think, "Oh, we have done a great thing."

07:55.681 --> 07:57.931
Christians go to the church;

07:58.430 --> 08:00.431
they'll think they have done very good.

08:01.181 --> 08:04.806
Muslims will go and pray and think that they are great.

08:05.430 --> 08:07.430
What have they achieved?

08:07.931 --> 08:10.306
Face yourself, please.

08:10.556 --> 08:14.430
Face your limitations.

08:14.806 --> 08:16.931
Face your tribulations.

08:17.306 --> 08:20.431
Face your problems and see for yourself:

08:20.931 --> 08:23.806
have you been able to solve your problems?

08:27.181 --> 08:33.430
Have you been able to save yourself from calamities?

08:34.931 --> 08:40.431
Maybe big calamities may come to destroy people who are,

08:41.181 --> 08:44.430
who are doing harm, maybe.

08:45.806 --> 08:48.306
That may be the wish of God.

08:48.681 --> 08:51.431
But what is your wish?

08:52.306 --> 08:54.430
Why don't you think that

08:54.806 --> 09:01.181
"I have to be a person who is a store,

09:01.556 --> 09:06.556
who is a source of joy and love"?

09:08.056 --> 09:12.681
I am not only talking, but I want you all

09:13.181 --> 09:15.306
to get your Self-realization.

09:15.931 --> 09:17.430
What is Self-realization

09:17.931 --> 09:21.430
-- is to know your Self. You don't know your Self.

09:22.431 --> 09:24.306
You don't know.

09:24.931 --> 09:27.431
You are living in this world without knowing your Self

09:27.931 --> 09:29.431
-- can you imagine?

09:29.931 --> 09:31.681
You don't know what you are.

09:32.306 --> 09:35.306
You don't know that you are the spirit,

09:36.556 --> 09:42.056
and that you are the source of knowledge,

09:42.430 --> 09:44.306
of pure knowledge.

09:44.681 --> 09:47.306
I find people sitting in a meeting,

09:47.806 --> 09:51.181
listening to some babaji

09:51.681 --> 09:55.681
who is telling them some story, very happy.

09:56.430 --> 10:02.306
This is not going to give you the reality and the truth.

10:03.430 --> 10:05.931
If you want to have reality and truth,

10:06.430 --> 10:08.556
then please try to understand

10:09.056 --> 10:11.431
that something has to happen

10:12.056 --> 10:15.431
to you, some transformation has to take place.

10:16.181 --> 10:18.430
You are not yet subtle enough,

10:18.931 --> 10:20.806
you haven't got those subtleties,

10:21.306 --> 10:23.430
till you reach that point --

10:23.806 --> 10:27.431
for which you don't have to leave your family,

10:28.181 --> 10:30.681
you don't have to leave your children,

10:31.806 --> 10:38.681
you don't have to leave your household and go to the jungles.

10:40.056 --> 10:42.430
There's no need to do all that.

10:43.056 --> 10:46.556
It's nice to say that "All right, you all take sanyasa

10:47.181 --> 10:50.056
and give all that belongs to you to me."

10:52.181 --> 10:54.806
It's such a stupid idea.

10:55.430 --> 10:59.430
These are emergencies today.

11:00.556 --> 11:05.306
We are living in a very emergent conditions

11:05.681 --> 11:07.181
-- try to understand.

11:07.556 --> 11:09.681
And I want to warn you

11:10.181 --> 11:12.556
that if you don't go deep into yourself

11:13.056 --> 11:15.806
and find out what you are,

11:17.431 --> 11:20.931
and take to your transformation,

11:21.430 --> 11:23.431
anything is possible.

11:24.931 --> 11:27.806
All kinds of diseases are coming up,

11:28.430 --> 11:32.681
all kinds of new problems of children coming up,

11:33.430 --> 11:36.931
all kinds of national problems are there,

11:37.431 --> 11:40.430
all kinds of international problems are there,

11:40.931 --> 11:43.806
that people can't help it.

11:45.056 --> 11:52.306
So we have to get out of this and become a solid,

11:52.556 --> 11:55.681
a personality of truth.

11:56.306 --> 11:58.306
We don't know what is the truth is.

11:59.931 --> 12:05.430
We are worse than animals whose eyes are open,

12:07.430 --> 12:09.556
while our eyes are closed.

12:10.931 --> 12:14.431
Is not to condemn yourself in any way,

12:15.556 --> 12:18.181
but to make you alert and aware

12:18.681 --> 12:21.931
that human beings have to change.

12:22.431 --> 12:26.431
Otherwise it's just, you come to My lecture,

12:26.931 --> 12:30.556
tomorrow you come to another lecture -- that's all.

12:31.056 --> 12:34.431
It's a everyday sort of a nice entertainment.

12:36.306 --> 12:41.181
But when I see the destiny,

12:41.681 --> 12:44.556
I don't know how many will be ruined,

12:45.306 --> 12:47.681
how many will be finished.

12:48.306 --> 12:50.181
What will happen to them?

12:50.556 --> 12:52.806
What diseases they will get,

12:53.430 --> 12:55.931
what problems they will get?

12:56.430 --> 12:58.556
What will happen to their children,

12:59.556 --> 13:01.931
what will happen to their country,

13:02.430 --> 13:05.056
and what will happen to the whole world?

13:06.430 --> 13:09.306
Just widen your vision.

13:10.430 --> 13:15.181
My vision is that all the people of the world

13:15.681 --> 13:18.056
should get transformation.

13:19.430 --> 13:23.306
We have enemies within ourselves,

13:25.931 --> 13:27.806
and when they talk of jihad,

13:28.306 --> 13:31.931
they talk that you fight your enemies within yourself.

13:32.431 --> 13:34.431
What are these enemies?

13:35.806 --> 13:39.431
These days, the worst is greed.

13:40.806 --> 13:43.181
There is greed.

13:43.556 --> 13:48.931
With that greed people can do anything they want to

13:49.431 --> 13:53.431
All kinds of things are happening out of greed.

13:54.056 --> 13:59.056
They'll have money, they'll have all kinds of facilities,

13:59.431 --> 14:04.306
but still this greed is such a satanic will of,

14:04.556 --> 14:07.556
that you don't even see what you have.

14:08.181 --> 14:12.431
And you want to have more and more, deceive people,

14:13.056 --> 14:15.931
deceive your government,

14:16.430 --> 14:19.806
deceive everyone and manage it.

14:25.430 --> 14:32.056
Then, another worse thing we have is anger.

14:33.430 --> 14:37.306
Anger doesn't allow you to see things as they are.

14:40.056 --> 14:44.056
We develop anger for small things:

14:45.430 --> 14:49.431
like you have come to this country --

14:50.931 --> 14:58.430
I've seen people who are angry because of different color.

15:01.430 --> 15:03.431
I can't understand.

15:04.181 --> 15:06.556
God has made different colors;

15:06.931 --> 15:11.181
other we all would have looked same, like military,

15:12.056 --> 15:14.431
and life would have been miserable.

15:14.806 --> 15:17.681
So the color has been created by nature.

15:18.306 --> 15:23.556
So the whites or blacks -- what is the difference?

15:25.056 --> 15:27.430
I just don't understand.

15:27.931 --> 15:33.681
Because such a myth is going on.

15:34.931 --> 15:37.806
With this myth we are fighting.

15:38.430 --> 15:41.556
The whites are fighting with the blacks,

15:41.931 --> 15:44.556
and the blacks are fighting with the whites.

15:46.056 --> 15:53.931
And then they go also for burning their skin in the sun,

15:56.056 --> 15:58.430
getting skin cancers.

15:59.056 --> 16:01.056
I just don't understand.

16:01.431 --> 16:04.431
There's no logic, there's no balance

16:04.931 --> 16:08.430
in us to see that what we are doing.

16:09.806 --> 16:14.431
Why are we wasting this precious time,

16:15.181 --> 16:17.681
when we have to get transformation?

16:18.806 --> 16:21.931
This anger can be with anything;

16:24.430 --> 16:27.430
anything one can develop anger.

16:27.931 --> 16:33.181
Is like a human failing, which is very common.

16:34.430 --> 16:37.806
For the smallest thing people can get angry.

16:38.430 --> 16:41.931
And they like it, because with that they can oppress others;

16:42.430 --> 16:44.430
they could be aggressive.

16:44.806 --> 16:48.681
So they want to have this anger within them,

16:49.430 --> 16:53.556
and with that anger they try to dominate others.

16:55.556 --> 16:57.681
This is the biggest problem:

16:58.306 --> 17:02.430
why do we want to dominate others,

17:02.931 --> 17:05.430
why do we want to oppress others,

17:06.056 --> 17:09.181
and why do we want to take control of others?

17:09.556 --> 17:11.556
We can't control ourselves;

17:11.931 --> 17:15.181
why are we wanting to control others?

17:16.181 --> 17:17.556
What is the need?

17:20.681 --> 17:23.931
Then, there are attachments:

17:25.056 --> 17:29.806
attachments to their houses,

17:30.181 --> 17:35.181
to their lands, to their children, to everything.

17:35.681 --> 17:41.931
But tomorrow you won't be here.

17:44.181 --> 17:46.431
You'll go with open hands.

17:47.056 --> 17:50.306
You can't carry anything with you.

17:51.556 --> 17:56.806
So such attachment to things:

17:58.056 --> 18:01.056
they're very particular about their cars,

18:01.430 --> 18:04.181
about their house, maintain it.

18:04.430 --> 18:09.430
But what about yourself? Are you all right?

18:10.556 --> 18:16.556
Inside, are you absolutely calm, peaceful and joyful?

18:18.056 --> 18:20.431
Why are you wasting your energy

18:28.430 --> 18:31.681
in getting angry with others?

18:37.056 --> 18:46.806
That's the sign of life that will be also destroyed.

18:50.430 --> 18:59.431
If you look at another person he has, say, weaknesses,

19:01.181 --> 19:04.931
apart from money, for women -- is very common --

19:05.431 --> 19:08.430
or women having for men.

19:09.556 --> 19:13.181
To get attractive, for what?

19:14.431 --> 19:16.806
Everybody has to get old.

19:18.056 --> 19:23.806
What have you achieved by running after women,

19:24.306 --> 19:28.430
running after other sex?

19:29.556 --> 19:34.430
You have no sense of dignity, no sense of honor.

19:34.931 --> 19:37.806
If you are -- as long as you wear very good clothes

19:38.181 --> 19:40.430
you are regarded wonderful person.

19:41.806 --> 19:43.430
This is not the way.

19:43.931 --> 19:47.430
We have to introspect and see for ourselves:

19:47.931 --> 19:49.931
why are we doing this,

19:50.430 --> 19:53.430
wasting our energy into nonsensical thing?

19:58.056 --> 20:03.306
So many people I meet are really half-mad and far gone;

20:03.556 --> 20:05.931
some of them are full-mad.

20:07.431 --> 20:09.431
And what they tell Me, that

20:09.931 --> 20:12.306
they wanted to marry a particular woman

20:12.431 --> 20:14.431
and a particular man or anything,

20:14.931 --> 20:18.556
and that's how they got it. I mean, how fragile!

20:21.431 --> 20:23.431
That's not being very great.

20:24.181 --> 20:29.931
You have to be very, very strong within yourself.

20:30.430 --> 20:35.056
Feel your Self. Your Self is the spirit,

20:35.430 --> 20:38.806
is the reflection of God Almighty within you.

20:39.430 --> 20:41.931
You can be very strong,

20:42.430 --> 20:44.181
you can be very healthy

20:44.430 --> 20:46.431
and you can be absolutely balanced,

20:46.931 --> 20:48.681
if you become the spirit.

20:50.181 --> 20:54.181
You have heard so much about spirit and spiritual life

20:57.430 --> 21:00.430
-- but have you reached that point?

21:01.681 --> 21:05.181
Even when you read, say, Zen system,

21:05.431 --> 21:10.181
Tao system, Bible, Koran, anything,

21:12.181 --> 21:16.431
do you know how to reach that point of the spirit?

21:17.056 --> 21:19.431
Not yet. Not yet.

21:20.181 --> 21:22.430
You have to know that;

21:22.806 --> 21:25.306
because you are very great,

21:25.681 --> 21:28.431
you are very precious,

21:29.056 --> 21:32.430
and you are so beautiful within.

21:33.431 --> 21:35.806
But you are not aware of it.

21:36.931 --> 21:39.056
You have to become that.

21:40.181 --> 21:43.431
That becoming is very important,

21:44.056 --> 21:49.431
and for that already God Almighty has organized within you

21:50.806 --> 21:54.556
which is called as kundalini,

21:56.431 --> 21:58.431
which can be awakened,

21:59.181 --> 22:03.806
and its awakening can give you Self-realization,

22:04.431 --> 22:08.931
can give you self-knowledge which we call "Atma sakshatkar."

22:09.430 --> 22:13.556
That's what is very, very important in your life to have it.

22:14.056 --> 22:15.431
And when it is free --

22:16.056 --> 22:18.806
you can't pay for it, how much can you pay?

22:21.430 --> 22:24.430
-- when it is absolutely free,

22:24.806 --> 22:28.431
why don't you take your Self-realization,

22:29.181 --> 22:32.056
and why don't you grow?

22:32.556 --> 22:35.681
Instead of fighting in the name of religion.

22:38.681 --> 22:42.181
Every religion has said "You know thy Self."

22:45.430 --> 22:47.681
Mohammed Sahib has said very clearly,

22:47.917 --> 22:51.681
"At the time of resurrection your hands will speak."

22:53.306 --> 22:55.430
Are they speaking?

22:56.681 --> 22:58.931
Hindus know about it,

22:59.430 --> 23:02.431
that we have to get our Self-realization.

23:03.181 --> 23:07.430
No use just listening to these babajis and giving them money.

23:11.556 --> 23:17.306
All this kind of rituals

23:18.431 --> 23:21.431
that we have been doing, our forefathers have been doing:

23:21.730 --> 23:24.056
what have we achieved? Nothing.

23:26.784 --> 23:30.181
So now, it's important for us to know

23:30.556 --> 23:36.430
that we have to have our evolution,

23:38.056 --> 23:41.430
reaching to the point of Self-realization.

23:42.960 --> 23:46.430
If we were perfect there would have been no problem

23:47.931 --> 23:50.681
If we were self-realized people

23:51.181 --> 23:53.681
there would have been no problem.

23:55.181 --> 23:57.430
All kinds of selfishness,

23:58.056 --> 24:03.556
all kinds of limits we have put upon ourselves,

24:04.306 --> 24:07.056
all kinds of conditioning and ego

24:07.556 --> 24:13.430
which has been working our life and have been ruining us,

24:13.681 --> 24:16.931
we have to get over it.

24:17.014 --> 24:19.769
And once you get over it, you get united.

24:20.019 --> 24:22.894
Nobody has to tell you that you get united.

24:23.269 --> 24:27.018
You lose all misidentifications.

24:29.767 --> 24:31.767
The time is running short.

24:32.517 --> 24:34.517
I've been now here for the last,

24:34.892 --> 24:36.892
I don't know, twenty years or so.

24:37.517 --> 24:39.766
I worked very hard,

24:40.267 --> 24:44.142
but what I find that people don't realize

24:44.517 --> 24:46.517
what they are supposed to do.

24:50.767 --> 24:55.767
They like people who will just say something very simple

24:56.517 --> 24:59.517
-- all right, it's a little entertainment.

25:00.767 --> 25:06.517
So the whole humanity has to understand

25:07.892 --> 25:13.767
that destiny of destruction is to be avoided.

25:14.517 --> 25:17.767
Complete destruction is to be avoided.

25:19.267 --> 25:24.017
And very simple is that you enter into the Kingdom of God

25:24.766 --> 25:27.766
-- which is very easy: you don't have to pay anything,

25:28.267 --> 25:30.642
don't have to work out anything.

25:32.017 --> 25:34.142
You take your Self-realization,

25:34.766 --> 25:40.142
and then at home you spend about ten minutes meditating.

25:42.642 --> 25:48.517
Only your mind is all the time justifying your misbehavior.

25:48.892 --> 25:52.766
I call it "misbehavior" because it's against you.

25:53.142 --> 25:57.766
It's against God's wish,

25:58.766 --> 26:01.767
it's against humanity

26:02.267 --> 26:05.892
and it will destroy all the human beings.

26:07.767 --> 26:12.267
All these misidentifications have to be dropped,

26:12.766 --> 26:16.142
and you have to know that we are all one.

26:17.392 --> 26:21.766
We are all one, we are all global,

26:23.142 --> 26:27.017
we are not separated by color,

26:27.517 --> 26:31.766
race or religion, nation -- no.

26:33.142 --> 26:34.766
We are all one,

26:34.892 --> 26:40.369
and that oneness should not be established by slogans

26:41.240 --> 26:42.741
or by shouting,

26:42.766 --> 26:46.267
but should be that oneness is to be felt within.

26:49.142 --> 26:51.767
It's not artificial.

26:52.267 --> 26:55.766
It has to be real, very real oneness,

26:56.142 --> 26:58.766
and that comes to you once you realize

26:59.017 --> 27:02.017
that you are part and parcel of the whole.

27:04.392 --> 27:10.392
Religions have brought you up to this point of awareness

27:10.767 --> 27:14.892
-- not for fighting, not for killing.

27:18.017 --> 27:20.142
Why, why?

27:20.766 --> 27:23.892
Human beings have diverted themselves.

27:24.392 --> 27:29.267
Because of complete ignorance of righteousness.

27:30.392 --> 27:39.017
Because of complete greed of oneself:

27:40.517 --> 27:46.392
oneself, just yourself, or your family at the most,

27:46.767 --> 27:49.142
or your relation.

27:51.392 --> 27:53.684
Why do you want to delimit yourself?

27:53.850 --> 27:55.766
You are the spirit.

27:56.184 --> 28:02.766
Spirit is the ocean, ocean of knowledge,

28:04.017 --> 28:06.642
is the ocean of love,

28:07.766 --> 28:10.642
is the ocean of all blessings.

28:11.892 --> 28:14.767
So we have to decide.

28:15.392 --> 28:18.017
Today I have to request you,

28:18.642 --> 28:21.392
that there's not so much time left.

28:21.892 --> 28:26.767
We have to decide that we have to become the spirit

28:27.392 --> 28:30.142
That's all the religions have taught.

28:30.642 --> 28:37.142
But how to do it was not so much explained,

28:38.766 --> 28:40.642
and it didn't work out.

28:41.017 --> 28:44.892
Some of them did get it but they were outcasted.

28:45.517 --> 28:47.517
Nobody listened to them.

28:47.892 --> 28:51.017
Even people killed them and tortured them, crucified them.

28:52.517 --> 28:59.517
But now, please, all of you try to understand

28:59.892 --> 29:02.267
the value of your life.

29:03.517 --> 29:05.767
Why are you a human being?

29:06.142 --> 29:08.017
Why are you created?

29:08.642 --> 29:10.642
What is the purpose behind it?

29:10.892 --> 29:15.517
Are we going to be driven by nonsensical ideas?

29:17.367 --> 29:26.742
Are we going to be finished by all sorts of dividing factors?

29:26.767 --> 29:31.517
No, no, we are all going to get your Self-realization,

29:32.767 --> 29:36.142
and we are going to understand the value of our life.

29:38.142 --> 29:42.267
The problem is, you'll get your realization

29:42.642 --> 29:46.517
in the sense the power within you will rise.

29:46.892 --> 29:48.766
It's very well organized;

29:49.142 --> 29:52.267
actually, God is a great creator.

29:52.766 --> 29:58.517
How He has balanced and how it works out is remarkable.

29:59.017 --> 30:01.766
Every individual He has done it.

30:02.267 --> 30:07.267
With that happening, is not sufficient.

30:08.766 --> 30:11.766
You enter into, say, a palace

30:12.267 --> 30:15.767
and then you go round and see for yourself

30:16.267 --> 30:18.642
how beautiful you are,

30:19.142 --> 30:22.392
what beautiful things God has made for you.

30:23.892 --> 30:26.392
Then grow into it.

30:26.766 --> 30:29.517
Once you have grown into it,

30:30.017 --> 30:35.392
then you will realize what a great thing you are:

30:36.642 --> 30:44.766
the greatest gem, the greatest person, so loving.

30:46.017 --> 30:47.766
There have been some

30:48.267 --> 30:51.392
-- they have become just statues.

30:51.767 --> 30:57.267
Nobody tries to understand what were they doing,

30:57.766 --> 30:59.392
how they were there.

31:02.551 --> 31:10.425
So, tonight we can have the experience,

31:11.142 --> 31:14.766
the experience of the spirit.

31:15.142 --> 31:18.892
Is a very unusual, rare thing.

31:19.392 --> 31:21.267
It never used to happen like that.

31:21.766 --> 31:25.267
But it is now, so why not take advantage of it?

31:27.517 --> 31:31.642
Please, be ready for that,

31:32.017 --> 31:36.142
accept it, take it, and become.

31:36.766 --> 31:38.767
Becoming is the point.

31:39.267 --> 31:41.767
What you become is the point.

31:42.267 --> 31:48.517
And what you make out of this whole human civilization

31:49.017 --> 31:52.642
is your problem, not Mine.

31:53.892 --> 31:56.267
I can help you.

31:56.766 --> 31:58.766
I can work it out.

31:59.017 --> 32:06.142
So I would request you all to now be ready for Self-realization.

32:08.767 --> 32:10.766
It's much better,

32:11.267 --> 32:14.767
but those who do not want to have cannot be forced.

32:16.766 --> 32:19.642
So it's better such people leave,

32:20.017 --> 32:23.142
leave the hall if they don't want to have.

32:26.767 --> 32:28.766
May God bless you all.

32:55.766 --> 32:58.392
Firstly, you don't have to do anything

33:01.267 --> 33:04.766
-- meaning also, don't think what I have said.

33:07.267 --> 33:12.142
Try to keep your thoughts very peaceful,

33:13.517 --> 33:17.642
and I'm sure all of you can get your Self-realization.

33:19.267 --> 33:21.766
But how many will grow?

33:22.267 --> 33:26.767
Because you have to come to the follow-up,

33:28.267 --> 33:32.392
then you have to practice it in the centers

33:32.892 --> 33:35.517
-- and it works out.

33:36.017 --> 33:39.892
Little bit time you have to give to yourself,

33:40.766 --> 33:44.142
and to this global problem.

33:45.766 --> 33:48.142
You have to dedicate yourself to that.

33:48.766 --> 33:52.766
Is very important: you have to dedicate yourself.

33:53.392 --> 33:56.642
That doesn't mean that you have to become sanyasi

33:56.892 --> 34:00.017
or you have to be busy with this for twenty-four hours -- nothing.

34:00.642 --> 34:06.142
But this dedication will make you so much

34:08.142 --> 34:09.892
one with yourself,

34:10.517 --> 34:12.766
with the whole universe,

34:13.267 --> 34:16.892
that I don't have to tell you that you dedicate

34:17.392 --> 34:20.392
-- you'll dedicate by yourself.

34:23.766 --> 34:26.766
So please don't stay here

34:27.017 --> 34:29.392
if you don't want to have Self-realization.

34:29.892 --> 34:31.767
Nothing will happen to you.

34:32.392 --> 34:37.642
Please leave the hall in case you don't want Self-realization.

34:51.017 --> 34:56.767
What you have to do is not to do anything;

34:58.517 --> 35:01.142
to put just your hands towards Me.

35:03.142 --> 35:06.142
Of course, if you are wearing shoes better take them out,

35:06.766 --> 35:09.642
because Mother Earth is very important.

35:11.142 --> 35:13.767
Please put both the hands towards Me.

35:27.767 --> 35:29.767
You don't have to pray,

35:30.267 --> 35:31.766
you don't have to say anything; just

35:32.267 --> 35:34.766
put your hands towards Me, just like this.

35:48.767 --> 35:51.766
Now please close your eyes.

35:52.392 --> 35:57.517
It is important. Please close your eyes.

36:07.392 --> 36:12.267
This power, kundalini, is placed in the triangular bone,

36:14.766 --> 36:18.766
known as sacrum, means "sacred",

36:19.267 --> 36:28.267
and it rises through six centers of the parasympathetic,

36:28.767 --> 36:32.267
and ultimately pierces through

36:36.392 --> 36:39.267
the fontanel bone area

36:39.642 --> 36:42.017
which was a soft bone in your head,

36:42.766 --> 36:45.017
on top of your head.

36:50.017 --> 36:53.267
When you were a child, it was a soft bone.

36:53.767 --> 36:56.766
It pierces through that,

36:58.517 --> 37:01.392
and enters into the subtle energy

37:03.392 --> 37:10.892
of all-pervading Power of divine love.

37:13.766 --> 37:16.517
They call it by different name.

37:17.017 --> 37:22.142
They call it "Paramachaitanya" -- some call it "chaitanya."

37:23.766 --> 37:27.142
Some call it as "ruh."

37:27.766 --> 37:33.766
You may call it by any name -- is the love, love of God.

37:35.517 --> 37:37.767
Once you get connected with you,

37:39.142 --> 37:43.142
when you start feeling on your fingers

37:45.392 --> 37:47.267
some sort of a breeze.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.766
First some people will get hot, doesn't matter;

37:52.267 --> 37:54.392
but then it cools down

37:54.766 --> 37:58.517
and you get the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost, as they call it.

38:01.142 --> 38:03.267
And it starts flowing.

38:05.142 --> 38:08.767
You can now raise your left hand

38:09.267 --> 38:12.892
on top of your fontanel bone area.

38:13.517 --> 38:16.766
Keep your eyes shut, and see for yourself

38:17.017 --> 38:21.517
if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

38:31.642 --> 38:33.392
You can move your hand.

38:36.642 --> 38:38.892
Now see with your right hand

38:39.766 --> 38:42.392
if there's a cool or a hot breeze

38:42.766 --> 38:45.892
coming out of your fontanel bone area,

38:46.392 --> 38:49.267
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

38:49.766 --> 38:51.267
See for yourself.

38:51.642 --> 38:53.892
Bend your head; better is to bend.

38:54.517 --> 38:56.517
Please bend your head.

38:58.267 --> 39:01.517
Again put your right hand towards Me

39:03.017 --> 39:08.767
and see for yourself with the left hand,

39:09.392 --> 39:15.267
see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

39:15.766 --> 39:18.767
If it is hot it's all right, doesn't matter.

39:19.267 --> 39:22.642
It is coming because of the heat within you.

39:39.142 --> 39:44.142
Now all those who have felt cool or a hot breeze

39:44.766 --> 39:47.267
in their hands or on their fingers,

39:47.766 --> 39:50.392
or out of the fontanel bone area

39:50.766 --> 39:52.766
-- this is the real baptism --

39:52.892 --> 39:55.766
please raise both your hands.

40:04.766 --> 40:06.142
Just imagine:

40:06.766 --> 40:10.642
you are the soldiers who are going to save the world

40:11.642 --> 40:13.766
from its destruction.

40:14.267 --> 40:16.392
Try to understand your importance.

40:17.892 --> 40:20.392
You can put down your hand.

40:20.767 --> 40:24.766
Everyone practically has felt it.

40:25.267 --> 40:27.267
That means you are already matured

40:27.766 --> 40:29.642
to get your spiritual life.

40:29.892 --> 40:32.642
You are just on the brink of it.

40:33.142 --> 40:35.267
That's how you got it.

40:35.766 --> 40:40.767
It's last jump to reality.

40:41.267 --> 40:45.766
Now, you should know what is this, what are you,

40:46.766 --> 40:48.767
what is your spirit

40:49.767 --> 40:53.642
and what you can do; what are your powers are,

40:53.892 --> 40:56.017
what are spiritual powers.

40:56.517 --> 40:58.267
For this I would request you

40:58.766 --> 41:01.142
to first to come to the follow-up program,

41:01.642 --> 41:06.392
and after that you can join any one of the centers

41:06.766 --> 41:09.892
which are closer to you and work it out.

41:10.517 --> 41:12.767
We have to work for the whole world.

41:14.267 --> 41:16.767
You should know there are eighty-five countries

41:17.267 --> 41:19.766
which are following Sahaja Yoga.

41:20.267 --> 41:25.517
And surprisingly, black country like Benin,

41:25.767 --> 41:28.766
we have twenty thousand Sahaja yogis.

41:29.142 --> 41:31.892
Only three years back I started there.

41:32.392 --> 41:36.766
And in England it's more than sixteen years

41:37.267 --> 41:41.767
I've been working here, and after that also:

41:42.267 --> 41:44.892
all the time, every year.

41:45.517 --> 41:47.017
But somehow

41:52.642 --> 41:57.392
their growth is very much there,

41:58.766 --> 42:06.517
but not subtle growth, not within ourselves.

42:10.767 --> 42:16.517
The growth is within, and you'll enjoy,

42:17.017 --> 42:19.766
very much enjoy the reality.

42:20.142 --> 42:23.892
The reality is beautiful, absolutely beautiful.

42:25.517 --> 42:27.392
May God bless you.

42:32.017 --> 42:33.767
They want to sing one song

42:34.517 --> 42:38.017
which was written in the twelfth century

42:38.517 --> 42:41.766
by a saint in India and is sung in all the villages,

42:42.017 --> 42:44.642
but nobody knows the meaning of that.

42:45.767 --> 42:49.767
The meaning is that "Oh Mother,

42:50.392 --> 42:52.892
give me the union, 'Jogwa'

42:53.642 --> 42:54.892
-- give me the union.

42:56.267 --> 43:00.767
I will give up my bad habits. I'll give up my temper. I'll give ..."

43:01.392 --> 43:02.766
You don't have to do it.

43:03.017 --> 43:05.766
Now you'll give up automatically.

43:07.267 --> 43:10.142
The light that you'll have, itself,

43:10.517 --> 43:14.267
automatically you will give up, automatically.

43:14.766 --> 43:16.517
You don't have to do anything.

43:16.767 --> 43:19.517
But you have to meditate.

43:19.850 --> 43:23.766
About ten minutes, it's not much.
