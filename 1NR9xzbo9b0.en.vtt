WEBVTT

00:34.000 --> 00:45.880
You see, here we are in the seminar and we
are all Sahaja Yogis and we are having a good

00:45.880 --> 00:51.440
time, we are cracking jokes, we’re discussing
things, etc., etc.

00:51.440 --> 00:57.490
But, this is all very well, I mean, one can
enjoy oneself, in fact one should enjoy oneself

00:57.490 --> 01:02.170
because the whole creation has been created
in such a way that we should enjoy ourselves.

01:02.170 --> 01:08.810
From the dawn of the creation, the Shri Adi
Shakti of the Universe has played out a drama

01:08.810 --> 01:14.680
using Her Deities, using all the powers that
She created, to create a Universe so beautiful

01:14.680 --> 01:20.330
that it should be possible for us to live
in it in complete joy and complete enjoyment

01:20.330 --> 01:21.330
of our existence.

01:21.330 --> 01:24.840
If one gives you an example…

01:24.840 --> 01:28.890
Yesterday we sat and we listened to ragas.

01:28.890 --> 01:33.241
These ragas themselves were inspired by the
Shri Adi Shakti in realized souls those who

01:33.241 --> 01:35.350
gave them to the world.

01:35.350 --> 01:38.409
The whole thing has been created by Her in
different aspects.

01:38.409 --> 01:46.710
So that we should enjoy ourselves and so that
we should not be miserable.

01:46.710 --> 01:48.380
And why does She want us to be happy?

01:48.380 --> 01:53.650
Because it is when you are happy and relaxed
than the power of God can work on you, to

01:53.650 --> 01:59.549
raise you to a great height for which you
are destined.

01:59.549 --> 02:06.780
You see, this whole drama that has taken place
is not a drama without purpose.

02:06.780 --> 02:11.620
Within it lies something that is profoundly
important and that something which is profoundly

02:11.620 --> 02:16.900
important is the awareness of God the Absolute
the Almighty.

02:16.900 --> 02:21.909
And this is the whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga.

02:21.909 --> 02:27.469
All the different techniques we use are a
bridge to this.

02:27.469 --> 02:32.310
You see, you have to understand what is Shri
Mataji on this Earth.

02:32.310 --> 02:33.529
She is the Adi Shakti.

02:33.529 --> 02:37.269
Now, how many people know what is the Adi
Shakti?

02:37.269 --> 02:41.079
The Adi Shakti is the power of God Almighty
Himself.

02:41.079 --> 02:46.930
It is the highest manifest thing in the Universe.

02:46.930 --> 02:52.299
When this thing takes Avatara in the Universe
for the first time, there must be a profound

02:52.299 --> 02:55.000
significance behind this.

02:55.000 --> 03:02.760
And this profound significance must be the
awareness of the Lord the Almighty.

03:02.760 --> 03:08.329
In your body are placed the various chakras
of the tantra.

03:08.329 --> 03:09.669
The instrument.

03:09.669 --> 03:11.689
Tantra means instrument.

03:11.689 --> 03:14.290
What are this chakras for?

03:14.290 --> 03:19.230
And people spend a lot of time cleaning them,
taking them out, putting them in salt water,

03:19.230 --> 03:20.829
putting them back again.

03:20.829 --> 03:23.329
But for what purpose?

03:23.329 --> 03:25.010
You see, you have to think for what purpose.

03:25.010 --> 03:28.819
Try to think why you are here instead of doing
things routinely.

03:28.819 --> 03:35.219
The chakras raise the awareness of the human
individual from step to step, higher and higher

03:35.219 --> 03:38.079
until it can reach the throne of the Almighty
Himself.

03:38.079 --> 03:40.189
That is their purpose.

03:40.189 --> 03:45.199
So, those who do not use it for that are like
a man who has a Rolls Royce who takes it apart,

03:45.199 --> 03:50.730
puts it in oil, puts it together again, starts
the engine and goes nowhere.

03:50.730 --> 03:57.280
You see, the whole tantras have been given
to you to raise your attention to the Absolutely

03:57.280 --> 03:58.730
the Almighty.

03:58.730 --> 04:02.129
The whole of Sahaja Yoga has been given to
you to raise your attention to the Absolute

04:02.129 --> 04:03.620
the Almighty.

04:03.620 --> 04:05.719
Your friends are given to you for this purpose.

04:05.719 --> 04:10.419
And the Shri Adi Shakti Herself has appeared
before you to give you this.

04:10.419 --> 04:17.199
Now, there is no doubt that Shri Adi Shakti
is Mahamaya.

04:17.199 --> 04:18.510
What does Mahamaya mean?

04:18.510 --> 04:21.440
And why is She Mahamaya?

04:21.440 --> 04:23.360
You see, you should question these basic fundamentals.

04:23.360 --> 04:28.590
After all, God is the Prime Architect of the
Universe.

04:28.590 --> 04:30.910
There is nothing that He does that is purposeless.

04:30.910 --> 04:33.550
You have to understand this.

04:33.550 --> 04:40.030
If we have purpose in what we do in our limitations
how much greater is His purpose?

04:40.030 --> 04:49.160
You see, if a long time ago, more than 1,400
years ago, Shri Adi Shankaracharya told human

04:49.160 --> 04:55.570
beings, “You are the Absolute, there is
no difference between you and God the Almighty,

04:55.570 --> 04:56.570
Adwaita."

04:56.570 --> 05:03.270
Now, if you are the Absolute, the Atma unless
you are diluted, there can be no creation,

05:03.270 --> 05:04.270
isn’t it?

05:04.270 --> 05:09.950
Because if you are always aware that you’re
the Atma Tattwa, how can you be involved in

05:09.950 --> 05:10.950
creation?

05:10.950 --> 05:14.750
You’ll always be lost in meditation on your
own existence.

05:14.750 --> 05:17.500
You have to understand this basic fact.

05:17.500 --> 05:23.070
So, the Mahamaya was necessary for the creation.

05:23.070 --> 05:26.820
She was necessary for the evolution of the
creation.

05:26.820 --> 05:31.090
Because by playing out dramas for you she
evolves you.

05:31.090 --> 05:34.730
And it’s only when you reach a certain level
that She can liberate you from herself.

05:34.730 --> 05:39.730
So, that you see beyond the Maya, the Absolute.

05:39.730 --> 05:45.680
Now, there is a saying in one of the Puranas
that, “The Devi can only be worshiped by

05:45.680 --> 05:48.540
those who are both, intelligent and brave."

05:48.540 --> 05:51.940
And She cannot be worshiped by the stupid
and the cowardly.

05:51.940 --> 05:56.970
This is very important, you see, we have been
given brains.

05:56.970 --> 06:00.500
We haven’t been given brains to sort out
trivialities of life.

06:00.500 --> 06:04.900
We have been given brains to chart our course
to the Almighty the Absolute.

06:04.900 --> 06:08.730
She is not going to spoon-feed you.

06:08.730 --> 06:13.140
Beyond a certain point you have to find the
course for yourself.

06:13.140 --> 06:17.820
The reason for this is that unless you do
so you are not worthy to be presented before

06:17.820 --> 06:18.820
the Almighty.

06:18.820 --> 06:23.070
Only those who are using their courage and
their intelligence, the strength of their

06:23.070 --> 06:28.700
desire can find the course, are worthy really
to come before Him.

06:28.700 --> 06:36.500
This is all part of the evolution of mankind.

06:36.500 --> 06:40.910
To understand and appreciate the Almighty
you have to have an awareness that is capable

06:40.910 --> 06:44.390
of receiving it.

06:44.390 --> 06:49.260
About two years ago Shri Mataji came to Riyadh
and I’ve written a Sanskrit poem which I

06:49.260 --> 06:50.430
presented to Her.

06:50.430 --> 06:54.340
And She began to complete it for me because
it was incomplete.

06:54.340 --> 06:59.580
And one of the verses was, “…how can I
pour all this into such small cups?

06:59.580 --> 07:00.580
..."

07:00.580 --> 07:04.600
You see, because the awareness, the brain
is not yet developed to the point it can take

07:04.600 --> 07:08.940
the radiation, the full weight of radiation
of the Almighty into it.

07:08.940 --> 07:11.710
So, how are you going to develop the brain?

07:11.710 --> 07:15.330
After all, the brain is the Agnya chakra.

07:15.330 --> 07:23.420
You develop the brain by focusing it on the
nature of the Almighty the Absolute.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.500
Contemplating it every day of one’s existence.

07:26.500 --> 07:30.900
In this way the attention goes up to it.

07:30.900 --> 07:32.490
And the nerves in the brain get refined.

07:32.490 --> 07:37.980
The petals of the Sahastrara get refined to
the point that they can receive the grace

07:37.980 --> 07:42.350
of the Absolute and His awareness.

07:42.350 --> 07:44.310
The Shri Adi Shakti is His Shakti.

07:44.310 --> 07:47.530
She is the power by which all things are done.

07:47.530 --> 07:50.639
She is the one who refine your brain for you.

07:50.639 --> 07:53.940
But you yourself have to put your attention
there.

07:53.940 --> 08:01.210
It is very easy in Sahaja Yoga because one
is left alone a lot to put one’s attention

08:01.210 --> 08:04.540
on trivialities.

08:04.540 --> 08:08.650
A chakra may catch.

08:08.650 --> 08:10.100
But what does it matter?

08:10.100 --> 08:14.600
The catch may release within five or ten minutes.

08:14.600 --> 08:18.330
So, why bother about it?

08:18.330 --> 08:21.230
That we know that the catches move from chakra
to chakra.

08:21.230 --> 08:27.720
That the movement of the kundalini moves from
chakra to chakra.

08:27.720 --> 08:54.220
So, what is the purpose of concentrating on
things that are trivial?

08:54.220 --> 08:59.149
In the past, you see, many great seekers came
on this Earth to seek God.

08:59.149 --> 09:00.300
After what are you seeking?

09:00.300 --> 09:01.550
What does seeking mean?

09:01.550 --> 09:03.110
It means to seek God.

09:03.110 --> 09:07.120
They had no Shri Adi Shakti to help them.

09:07.120 --> 09:09.600
You have it here in front of you.

09:09.600 --> 09:14.579
So, you should take advantage of it.

09:14.579 --> 09:22.990
And try and become fixed at that point which
is the Absolute.

09:22.990 --> 09:29.830
And you may all be here in a collective but
the relationship between you and the Absolute

09:29.830 --> 09:33.430
has to be individual between you and Him alone.

09:33.430 --> 09:36.829
And when you see Him, you don’t see anyone
else.

09:36.829 --> 09:37.959
You see.

09:37.959 --> 09:43.670
It is very good to be in the collective, it
is very good to be with each other to enjoy

09:43.670 --> 09:53.339
each other’s company but your relationship
with each other should be such that it fosters

09:53.339 --> 09:56.740
that ascent to the Divine the Absolute.

09:56.740 --> 09:58.519
We have to be very clear.

09:58.519 --> 10:02.480
The whole purpose of Sahaja Yoga is this ascent.

10:02.480 --> 10:08.060
The great Goddess Herself the Shri Adi Shakti
has a devotion to our Lord which is indescribable

10:08.060 --> 10:10.860
in human terms.

10:10.860 --> 10:15.559
The whole play between the Almighty and the
Shakti is something which is one of the profoundest

10:15.559 --> 10:21.029
mysteries of mankind and of the Creation.

10:21.029 --> 10:26.339
And the deepest desire of the Shri Adi Shakti
is the ascent of Her creation and Her children

10:26.339 --> 10:30.509
to the throne of the Almighty as an offering
to Her Lord.

10:30.509 --> 10:36.519
Just as we, when we present an offering to
Shri Mataji if there are flowers, we take

10:36.519 --> 10:39.850
out the worst flowers, we present only the
best, the most perfect.

10:39.850 --> 10:45.300
So, when the Shri Adi Shakti offers to Her
Lord Her Creation it is something at a level

10:45.300 --> 10:47.360
far removed from this.

10:47.360 --> 10:52.570
And only the most perfect that can be presented
before Him.

10:52.570 --> 10:53.570
You see.

10:53.570 --> 10:55.880
You have to understand this.

10:55.880 --> 10:57.821
As human beings we have no importance.

10:57.821 --> 11:05.879
Except, in so far as we play a part in this
play between the Lord and His Shakti.

11:05.879 --> 11:12.690
The entire creation can be discarded, if it
does not serve this purpose.

11:12.690 --> 11:18.209
Cause there are only two things which are
real in the Universe and that is the Lord

11:18.209 --> 11:19.209
and His Shakti.

11:19.209 --> 11:24.410
All else is superfluous to this and of no
importance.

11:24.410 --> 11:28.880
At the end of creation only those two things
will remain.

11:28.880 --> 11:35.639
So, you must not take lightly what is happening.

11:35.639 --> 11:39.029
You are the essential parts and pieces of
this drama.

11:39.029 --> 11:46.170
This very profound drama which is the basis
and the internal root of the Universe.

11:46.170 --> 11:51.180
Have you ever considered why the Mooladhara
chakra has four petals?

11:51.180 --> 11:53.569
What does it mean?

11:53.569 --> 11:54.760
Why four?

11:54.760 --> 12:00.850
It is four because if you combine the Lord
and the Shakti in the Sushumna where Their

12:00.850 --> 12:03.560
feet rest you will find four feet resting.

12:03.560 --> 12:09.230
It is the… that is why it is the ultimate
purity because it represents the combined

12:09.230 --> 12:15.059
feet of the Lord and his Shakti and that is
given as a throne to the son, Ganesha, the

12:15.059 --> 12:18.629
Lord, the Omkara to sit on.

12:18.629 --> 12:23.380
These things are very important, very profound.

12:23.380 --> 12:30.759
To be the seat of the play of the Lord and
Shakti one needs extreme purity, extreme wisdom

12:30.759 --> 12:33.850
and extreme awareness of what is happening.

12:33.850 --> 12:38.290
The whole purpose of this creation is that
and that alone.

12:38.290 --> 12:41.980
The creation was not made for you to iron
saris.

12:41.980 --> 12:44.029
To worry about your dhobi [laundryman].

12:44.029 --> 12:48.329
These are totally irrelevant.

12:48.329 --> 12:57.999
They won’t even last a century, leave alone
eternity.

12:57.999 --> 12:59.470
Nor is organization there.

12:59.470 --> 13:02.809
You can organize till you’re blue in the
face but unless the desire of the Absolute

13:02.809 --> 13:06.600
works you will not get another Sahaja Yogi.

13:06.600 --> 13:07.600
You have seen this.

13:07.600 --> 13:08.600
Many of you have.

13:08.600 --> 13:13.519
We had many wonderful experiences in the early
days when we turned up at empty halls in spite

13:13.519 --> 13:14.790
of massive publicity.

13:14.790 --> 13:18.329
You see, you do not do anything.

13:18.329 --> 13:21.879
Lord Krishna when He came He said, “You
do not do anything.

13:21.879 --> 13:23.399
I do it all."

13:23.399 --> 13:26.470
So, the human being who deludes himself into
thinking he is doing.

13:26.470 --> 13:27.470
He is not doing.

13:27.470 --> 13:28.620
He said, “Act!

13:28.620 --> 13:30.620
You have to act.

13:30.620 --> 13:34.309
But leave the results of your actions to Me."

13:34.309 --> 13:41.269
So, act without expectation is what He is
saying.

13:41.269 --> 13:45.130
Now, how are you going to awaken?

13:45.130 --> 13:48.670
What you are going to do?

13:48.670 --> 13:52.939
You see, when one acts, everyone knows what
the left side is what the right side is.

13:52.939 --> 13:57.040
One acts by the right using the power of desire
of the left.

13:57.040 --> 13:59.640
This is something that is well known to everybody.

13:59.640 --> 14:02.850
Through which chakra does one act?

14:02.850 --> 14:04.190
Which is the chakra of activity?

14:04.190 --> 14:07.130
Who will answer it?

14:07.130 --> 14:08.130
Of creation?

14:08.130 --> 14:13.560
You must all know this, it’s basic stuff.

14:13.560 --> 14:14.560
The Swadhisthana.

14:14.560 --> 14:15.560
Ok.

14:15.560 --> 14:17.759
The Swadhisthana is on the right, is it not?

14:17.759 --> 14:19.129
And the Shuddha Ichha is on the left.

14:19.129 --> 14:23.139
So, what is the bridge between the desire
of God the Almighty and action?

14:23.139 --> 14:24.689
It is the left Swadhisthana chakra.

14:24.689 --> 14:25.689
Correct?

14:25.689 --> 14:29.579
And that is why all boots go and sit there.

14:29.579 --> 14:31.930
To disconnect your action from your desire.

14:31.930 --> 14:33.989
Very simple, you see.

14:33.989 --> 14:42.429
Wherever the boots hit hard you must know
that is an important chakra.

14:42.429 --> 14:49.980
Now, you see, although we are human beings,
we are by the grace of God enlightened souls.

14:49.980 --> 14:55.980
This means that the entire tantra of the Universe
is present in miniature within us.

14:55.980 --> 15:00.000
This Shri Mataji has done and She said, “I’ve
placed you there.

15:00.000 --> 15:02.129
Now, what you do with yourself is your affair."

15:02.129 --> 15:10.050
Now, as the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe
… Does everyone know what the Shuddha Ichha

15:10.050 --> 15:11.050
is?

15:11.050 --> 15:13.739
The Shuddha Ichha is the pure desire of the
Universe.

15:13.739 --> 15:15.390
Now, what is the pure desire of the Universe?

15:15.390 --> 15:19.629
The pure desire of the Universe is God, the
desire of God Almighty Himself.

15:19.629 --> 15:25.079
As this flows through the Ida nadi of the
Universe and is carried by the Goddess Shri

15:25.079 --> 15:30.399
Mahakali to be placed, deposited within the
kundalini.

15:30.399 --> 15:37.110
So, this flows within your left side or can
flow within your left side if you desire it.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.529
To inform your activities.

15:38.529 --> 15:44.459
Now, you see, unless you are connected your
activities are without meaning.

15:44.459 --> 15:48.679
It is like ants scurrying around not knowing
what they are doing.

15:48.679 --> 15:52.490
So, first, one has to establish within oneself
the pure desire.

15:52.490 --> 15:55.589
Let it flow within your Ida nadi.

15:55.589 --> 15:57.199
How would you do that?

15:57.199 --> 15:58.660
It’s very simple.

15:58.660 --> 16:02.870
You pray to Shri Mataji and you say, “You
are the Shuddha Ichha of the Universe and

16:02.870 --> 16:06.809
I worship You as such."

16:06.809 --> 16:11.360
If you just do that, pray to Her, pray to
Her, is this, She will flow with such force

16:11.360 --> 16:16.829
within your Ida nadis that She will break
anything that is in your left Swadhisthana

16:16.829 --> 16:18.939
and flow into the right.

16:18.939 --> 16:21.809
To inform your activity.

16:21.809 --> 16:27.629
You cannot catch on the right side if your
left side is strong.

16:27.629 --> 16:28.629
You see.

16:28.629 --> 16:31.420
So, that is the first stage.

16:31.420 --> 16:35.639
If you do that the Shuddha Ichha, you don’t
need to do more than this, the Shuddha Ichha

16:35.639 --> 16:40.680
will flow through all your chakras, it will
eventually break open the barriers that are

16:40.680 --> 16:49.069
in your brain and infuse with enlightenment
and nectar every nerve fiber and cell within

16:49.069 --> 16:50.069
your brain.

16:50.069 --> 16:56.509
As it does that your whole consciousness and
awareness will be altered.

16:56.509 --> 17:02.610
As it is altered your awareness will be filled
with the awareness of the Absolute.

17:02.610 --> 17:07.809
As it is filled with the awareness of the
Absolute you will see Shri Mataji clearly

17:07.809 --> 17:11.530
for what She is which is the Shakti of God
Almighty Himself.

17:11.530 --> 17:15.600
We will not say, “Shri Mataji did this,
Shri Mataji did that,” you know, all the

17:15.600 --> 17:16.940
Maya and the play.

17:16.940 --> 17:19.660
Some people fill tragic one minute, happy
next…

17:19.660 --> 17:21.200
This is all nonsense.

17:21.200 --> 17:27.209
If you are based in yourself you will remain
absolutely stable in the sight of your parents,

17:27.209 --> 17:28.970
in the sight of the Almighty.

17:28.970 --> 17:32.060
You do not shift from day to day.

17:32.060 --> 17:33.070
You don’t doubt yourself.

17:33.070 --> 17:37.390
You cannot become Nirvikalpa until you know
this.

17:37.390 --> 17:41.990
Because part of the Nirvikalpa is not just
doubting God or Shri Mataji.

17:41.990 --> 17:43.510
It’s very easy not to do that.

17:43.510 --> 17:47.000
It’s not doubting yourself as an extension
of Them.

17:47.000 --> 17:51.690
Because as Shri Mataji said, She has made
every single one of us into a part of Her

17:51.690 --> 17:52.690
body.

17:52.690 --> 17:57.560
So, to doubt oneself is in a sense to doubt
Her.

17:57.560 --> 18:04.330
Now, people try to avoid recognizing what
has been done to them by getting Realization

18:04.330 --> 18:06.840
in Sahaja Yoga.

18:06.840 --> 18:09.410
You don’t want to see that they have been
made a part of the body of God Almighty Himself

18:09.410 --> 18:11.010
in a sense of His Shakti.

18:11.010 --> 18:16.520
Because this means that you can’t behave
in the same old ways you used to behave.

18:16.520 --> 18:23.270
You can’t be attached to the same old things
which you used to be attached to.

18:23.270 --> 18:54.800
You have to change, you see.

18:54.800 --> 18:55.800
Ready?

18:55.800 --> 18:56.800
Ok.

18:56.800 --> 19:01.650
And this is something that people don’t
understand.

19:01.650 --> 19:05.160
And this is an avoidance of Sahaja Yoga, this
is running away from it.

19:05.160 --> 19:09.310
The essence of Sahaja Yoga is the fact that
people have been …, human being has been

19:09.310 --> 19:14.930
taken, they have been given realization, they
have been made part of the body of the Divine

19:14.930 --> 19:19.480
and they have been given the opportunity to
raise their awareness to the highest level

19:19.480 --> 19:20.650
to attain God realization.

19:20.650 --> 19:22.260
That is it.

19:22.260 --> 19:23.870
It’s very simple.

19:23.870 --> 19:30.800
Everything else is a waste of time.

19:30.800 --> 19:34.650
And one has to recognize that although we
may be Sahaja Yogis we do not run the Universe;

19:34.650 --> 19:36.750
the Universe is run by us.

19:36.750 --> 19:41.310
I mean, run for us by the Almighty.

19:41.310 --> 19:45.510
And run by us for the Almighty.

19:45.510 --> 19:49.570
We cannot decide this has to happen, this
has to happen, we have to have twenty people

19:49.570 --> 19:50.570
next week.

19:50.570 --> 19:51.830
Cannot happen.

19:51.830 --> 20:00.030
God decides how many people He wants, He decides
where and when, you just have to be instruments.

20:00.030 --> 20:05.160
Not one of us can change the Universe even
so much.

20:05.160 --> 20:11.000
Unless we do it in the… on the crest of
a wave which precedes from the Almighty and

20:11.000 --> 20:13.140
work as instruments.

20:13.140 --> 20:19.890
The old days of siddhic Yogis who ride on
clouds and transform mountains and hurl thunderbolts

20:19.890 --> 20:21.430
are over, you see.

20:21.430 --> 20:23.700
That was meant for people who are right sided.

20:23.700 --> 20:25.960
Who wanted to do things themselves.

20:25.960 --> 20:27.550
That is not us.

20:27.550 --> 20:30.060
We are parts of the body of the Goddess.

20:30.060 --> 20:33.150
And each one of us has to be like e nerve
cell.

20:33.150 --> 20:36.000
When the brain tells us what to do, we have
to do it.

20:36.000 --> 20:40.700
As such we are all collective.

20:40.700 --> 20:41.770
That is the true collectivity.

20:41.770 --> 20:46.020
And if we… each of us recognize that we
are a nerve cell in the brain of the Goddess,

20:46.020 --> 20:51.990
permeating Her whole being then the whole
boundaries between nationalities, and this

20:51.990 --> 20:54.470
and that which keeps Sahaja Yogis apart dissolves.

20:54.470 --> 21:00.490
We all realize we are one, we are the same,
that each one of us is individual and each

21:00.490 --> 21:03.750
one of us has an individual relationship to
the Almighty.

21:03.750 --> 21:08.430
And all sorts of misidentifications fall away.

21:08.430 --> 21:15.510
Now one speaks a common language, no doubt
about it, it is real.

21:15.510 --> 21:16.980
And this is the common language of vibrations.

21:16.980 --> 21:22.720
If you are there you do not know how but you
communicate with people who have a different

21:22.720 --> 21:23.720
language.

21:23.720 --> 21:26.270
It’s so simple really.

21:26.270 --> 21:32.050
So, I wish really in this lecture to make
you aware of what is been given in Sahaja

21:32.050 --> 21:33.050
Yoga.

21:33.050 --> 21:38.900
What has been done by the Great Goddess in
Her absolute nature and for what purpose.

21:38.900 --> 21:45.510
So that you do not waste neither time nor
energy on other things.

21:45.510 --> 21:47.920
There is nothing greater than this.

21:47.920 --> 21:55.080
And since the Goddess Herself is All Powerful,
beyond time, beyond everything.

21:55.080 --> 22:03.180
So, your awareness has to be of a nature that
can comprehend that and be one with that awareness.

22:03.180 --> 22:06.780
You can become one with Her in awareness,
no doubt.

22:06.780 --> 22:09.520
And see things as She sees things.

22:09.520 --> 22:12.930
But for this your brain has to develop, you
see.

22:12.930 --> 22:16.050
So, this is what one has to do.

22:16.050 --> 22:19.640
And really the rest of it is not important.

22:19.640 --> 22:22.910
At that level, it doesn’t matter how time
passes.

22:22.910 --> 22:26.310
At that level, it doesn’t matter whether
there are miracles or not because the whole

22:26.310 --> 22:29.470
concept of a miracle is non-existent.

22:29.470 --> 22:31.830
Everything follows the desire of the Absolute.

22:31.830 --> 22:36.300
Who makes the rules that arbitrates between
a miracle and a non-miracle?

22:36.300 --> 22:37.670
Humans beings.

22:37.670 --> 22:39.710
It’s not God.

22:39.710 --> 22:42.190
For God there is no such things as a miracle.

22:42.190 --> 22:44.410
Everything is possible to Him.

22:44.410 --> 22:54.530
So, what I’m saying is hitch your awareness
higher, hook it at the higher level, keep

22:54.530 --> 22:55.530
it there.

22:55.530 --> 22:59.260
So that you see really what is happening.

22:59.260 --> 23:04.890
And do not, in spite of everything that has
been given, continue to move in the same circles,

23:04.890 --> 23:09.130
low circles that one inhabited before one’s
realization.

23:09.130 --> 23:10.652
This is very important.

23:10.652 --> 23:16.560
This is so important that I don’t know how
to say it.

23:16.560 --> 23:23.640
Work to increase the structure and capacity
of one’s brain, so that you can comprehend

23:23.640 --> 23:27.460
that which is Absolute.

23:27.460 --> 23:35.310
I do not know if there is anything more to
say to this.

23:35.310 --> 23:41.540
I remember once a long time back when I first
met Shri Mataji, Gregoire was there, lots

23:41.540 --> 23:43.720
of other chappies were there jumping around
with me.

23:43.720 --> 23:48.770
I remember one, early one morning after we
slept with Her in a flat in London, I was

23:48.770 --> 23:52.970
talking to Her and She says… you see…
we were talking about Maya.

23:52.970 --> 23:55.110
And I said, “Mother, I wish I could go beyond
Maya."

23:55.110 --> 24:00.120
And She said to me, this was some seven or
eight years ago, and She said to me, “One

24:00.120 --> 24:02.400
day you will, you will catch me."

24:02.400 --> 24:07.560
She said, “You will catch me."

24:07.560 --> 24:13.970
And what I’m trying to say, is that this
is what we should all aim for.

24:13.970 --> 24:15.930
Try to go beyond that.

24:15.930 --> 24:21.200
And you can only go beyond that when you can
touch the feet of the Absolute.

24:21.200 --> 24:26.060
The Absolute is like a mountain peak which
raises above the clouds.

24:26.060 --> 24:30.410
You cannot rise above the clouds until you
rest on that mountain peak.

24:30.410 --> 24:36.010
So, you cannot rise above Maya, it is impossible
until your awareness touches the feet of the

24:36.010 --> 24:37.760
Absolute.

24:37.760 --> 24:44.670
Because above Maya there is nothing but the
Absolute, The Atma Tattwa.

24:44.670 --> 24:54.910
You know, the Atma Tattwa rests in the Heart
of God the Almighty and ascends to dance in

24:54.910 --> 24:57.640
the Sahastrara as Sadashiva.

24:57.640 --> 25:00.220
So, the heart is a very important organ.

25:00.220 --> 25:05.180
Rajabhai said that when Shri Mataji gave him
realization, She said, “You young men have

25:05.180 --> 25:09.760
such hard hearts."

25:09.760 --> 25:10.910
And She was true in the sense.

25:10.910 --> 25:12.330
Most people do have hard hearts.

25:12.330 --> 25:14.730
Not necessary their fault.

25:14.730 --> 25:19.500
It may be the result of their experiences
in this world.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.960
But one’s heart should be like a lotus.

25:20.960 --> 25:23.230
I don’t know how many of you have touched
a lotus.

25:23.230 --> 25:27.120
But the petals are so soft, like silk.

25:27.120 --> 25:33.040
The heart of a man should be as soft as that.

25:33.040 --> 25:38.650
You see, we have got our realization regardless
of everything we have done.

25:38.650 --> 25:44.550
By the grace of God, the Almighty, by His
compassion, profound compassion, profound

25:44.550 --> 25:48.210
love for mankind, for the children of His
Shakti.

25:48.210 --> 25:52.460
He has granted – He says forget everything,
forget it, forget it.

25:52.460 --> 25:54.700
Forgive, you see, I forgive them.

25:54.700 --> 25:55.830
I forgive them.

25:55.830 --> 25:59.680
We have to be the same in our hearts to the
rest of the mankind.

25:59.680 --> 26:04.510
When the disciples of Christ, Peter I think,
once came to Christ and asked them: “How

26:04.510 --> 26:06.690
often should I forgive my brothers, seven
times?”

26:06.690 --> 26:08.560
And He said, “No, seventy times seven."

26:08.560 --> 26:15.780
And what He meant was infinitely.

26:15.780 --> 26:19.580
You see, one cannot be a good Sahaja Yogi,
this is my belief, unless one is kind, and

26:19.580 --> 26:23.720
one is gentle.

26:23.720 --> 26:25.990
Kindness and gentle doesn’t mean weakness.

26:25.990 --> 26:32.240
It means being soft, trying to further the
other person from one’s heart, caring for

26:32.240 --> 26:35.360
what Shri Mataji once called in Her lecture,
caring for his hita [benevolence].

26:35.360 --> 26:40.910
Try to see what is… how to do that which
is best for him, how to manipulate him in

26:40.910 --> 26:44.990
such a way that he raises.

26:44.990 --> 26:52.220
It means, going beyond oneself, you see, when
someone is harsh with you, is he harsh with

26:52.220 --> 26:53.220
you?

26:53.220 --> 26:55.820
If you are Atma how he can be harsh with you?

26:55.820 --> 26:59.770
If you are the Atma you can bear it all.

26:59.770 --> 27:02.880
And in spite of that try and resolve.

27:02.880 --> 27:13.410
The only thing we cannot really be expected
to tolerate is any insult to the Goddess Herself.

27:13.410 --> 27:16.330
There we have to be strong and firm.

27:16.330 --> 27:21.240
But it doesn’t mean that we take justice
in our own hands.

27:21.240 --> 27:25.650
Justice is …, belongs to the Almighty, not
to us.

27:25.650 --> 27:28.000
Christ also said, “Judge not that ye be
not judged."

27:28.000 --> 27:31.630
Made it very clear, that we have no right
to judge.

27:31.630 --> 27:35.360
We are not going to be sitting there, at the
end writing out who should go to hell and

27:35.360 --> 27:36.780
who should go to heaven.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.580
It is going to be done by someone else.

27:39.580 --> 27:41.650
So, we cannot judge.

27:41.650 --> 27:49.020
We have to leave it to God to judge and for
us to execute.

27:49.020 --> 27:55.110
We cannot abrogate to ourselves any of the
qualities of the Almighty, such as justice,

27:55.110 --> 27:57.570
judgment, decisiveness, planning.

27:57.570 --> 28:00.010
These belong to Him.

28:00.010 --> 28:03.470
We merely execute these.

28:03.470 --> 28:11.950
But when we are kind to a fellow man, to any
living thing that moves, within the context

28:11.950 --> 28:18.130
of its dharma on this world, we make the Lord
happy.

28:18.130 --> 28:21.970
By this I don’t mean that one goes around
like jains, not trying to kill insects because

28:21.970 --> 28:25.060
it is in the dharma of the insects to be crushed
beneath the feet of man.

28:25.060 --> 28:29.400
We’ve been both created this way that it
has… it is an inevitable outcome of living

28:29.400 --> 28:30.430
a normal life.

28:30.430 --> 28:33.400
One doesn’t go crazy, you see.

28:33.400 --> 28:34.400
We have to eat.

28:34.400 --> 28:39.750
Chicken, I mean it doesn’t mean you don’t
slaughter a chicken to be kind to it.

28:39.750 --> 28:42.240
We have to live within the boundaries.

28:42.240 --> 28:47.090
But there is no place for unnecessary cruelty
in this world.

28:47.090 --> 28:50.510
The Lord is not cruel.

28:50.510 --> 28:55.330
And if we are to partake of his essence and
of his nature we have to be like Him.

28:55.330 --> 29:06.120
So, the message I’m trying to give you is
that in spite of all the splendor that surrounds

29:06.120 --> 29:11.190
the Goddess and there must be because She
is, after all, the Shri Adi Shakti, do not

29:11.190 --> 29:16.201
forget that the deepest desire in our heart,
the Shuddha Ichha, is to raise you to the

29:16.201 --> 29:22.970
feet of Her Lord as offerings worthy of Him.

29:22.970 --> 29:32.510
And in all Her drama She tries constantly
in Her movement to bring you to that point.

29:32.510 --> 29:35.850
And I tell you that there is nothing else
in the Universe worth bothering about except

29:35.850 --> 29:37.500
this fact.

29:37.500 --> 29:45.320
If you love your Mother try to be worthy to
be offered by Her to Her Consort.

29:45.320 --> 29:55.200
And if you love your Father try to be worthy
to be offered to Him.

29:55.200 --> 30:01.010
And if you love Them both this will work out
inevitably because Their love will work through

30:01.010 --> 30:10.000
your heart, and the two will mingle, and you
cannot help but ascent.

30:10.000 --> 30:12.780
Live by your hearts not by your brains.

30:12.780 --> 30:17.780
That is not by your egos and superegos and
question the inner desires of your heart.

30:17.780 --> 30:18.780
Do not question them.

30:18.780 --> 30:19.820
You cannot question them.

30:19.820 --> 30:22.740
They are beyond logic.

30:22.740 --> 30:23.740
Live by your heart.

30:23.740 --> 30:31.100
If you express your heart you will lead to
such a sense of satisfaction with life that

30:31.100 --> 30:33.520
you cannot be angry with anyone.

30:33.520 --> 30:38.670
You will be so happy all the time that it’ll
be effortless for your Parents to lift you

30:38.670 --> 30:43.230
to that level which was your destiny at the
moment of your creation.

30:43.230 --> 30:45.440
That is all I have to say.

30:45.620 --> 30:50.700
Jai Shri Mataji.
