WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:07.120
It’s so very joyous to see you all here
assembled together. I’ve to thank you very

00:11.099 --> 00:18.099
much for getting such a nice place as this
Shudy Camp; I’ve given it a new name, Shoody

00:19.270 --> 00:26.270
Camp meaning cleansing camp
which is such an ancient building. It has
gone through various stages of history and

00:38.219 --> 00:45.219
has kept the mark of all these times and now
you have to build up the future on this land,

00:53.960 --> 00:58.449
on this spot, in this building.

00:58.449 --> 01:05.449
Also I’m thankful to you for buying such
a nice comfortable car for Me. I thought I

01:08.790 --> 01:12.910
was supposed to buy but everybody said, “No,
we are supposed to buy it for You, Mother.”

01:12.910 --> 01:19.910
This is the first house that is in My name,
first house I own and this is the first car

01:24.150 --> 01:31.150
I have owned in My name. I’m so proud that
My children have bought it for Me. They have,

01:49.230 --> 01:56.230
with their love and affection have bought
this huge big place as well as the car for

02:03.720 --> 02:10.720
My dwelling as well as for My comfort.

02:11.659 --> 02:18.659
When we come on this earth, when the incarnations
descend they don’t need a building at all;

02:30.280 --> 02:37.280
they have a dwelling that’s  face
the sky and the clouds are the curtains and

02:44.379 --> 02:51.379
grass is their bed and all the directions
are the worms. But when they reside in the

02:55.790 --> 03:02.790
heart of their children, in the heart of their
bhaktas, the heart of their devotees, then

03:06.420 --> 03:13.420
these beautiful hearts create something so
artistic

03:40.409 --> 03:47.409
and then re-creates according to his own
expression of love.

03:59.549 --> 04:06.549
This is what you have done by buying this
house and by buying this car, amen. I don’t

04:14.510 --> 04:21.510
need any conveyance, you know that. But in
the modern times the conveyance has changed.

04:33.860 --> 04:40.860
It started with a little mouse, changing into
a car, maybe an aeroplane. But actually what

05:03.159 --> 05:10.159
is My conveyance is? My conveyance is your
heart, only through your heart I can be carried.

05:24.919 --> 05:31.919
There’s no other way out. Your sincerity,
your devotion, your love, that can only carry

05:42.449 --> 05:49.449
your Mother and this is a symbol of that.

05:58.460 --> 06:05.300
Matter has only one facility that you can
express your heart through these material

06:05.300 --> 06:12.300
things. Your nobility, your graciousness,
your generosity is expressed through matter.

06:24.930 --> 06:31.930
I do that Myself and now you have done it
this time; I’m thankful to you. As you know

06:41.770 --> 06:48.770
very well that I cannot be contained into
anything, neither in this house, neither in

06:53.319 --> 07:00.319
England nor in India, nor in the whole universe.
I’m rather too large, but of course in your

07:03.659 --> 07:10.659
heart, I can. And that is how your heart should
be. For Me, a comfortable place like a lotus

07:25.560 --> 07:32.560
to relax, to realize My own love. When all
these things happen, so much adoration
is poured on your Mother you just get boundless;

08:02.680 --> 08:09.680
you spread out, you reach such spots in the
whole of humanity, everywhere I can feel the

08:33.490 --> 08:40.490
worship, the enjoyment of millions of millions
who died before, who are there and who will

08:48.170 --> 08:55.170
be there. All this expands you into a very
subtle sensibility of feeling every suffering

09:21.130 --> 09:28.130
soul, every tortured person, every unhappy
being, every seeker, every Sahaja Yogi all

09:40.220 --> 09:47.220
over the world. In you I see their reflection.

09:48.260 --> 09:55.260
In the same way you all have to expand, expand
yourself, that’s very important for England.

09:57.970 --> 10:04.970
As I said, England is the heart and the spirit
resides in the heart but spirit moves out

10:09.339 --> 10:16.339
of the heart sometimes, it does. And is reflected
through the soul and recently I told in Italy

10:24.649 --> 10:31.649
that Italy is the soul. That’s why you have
to go by a special plane to Italy to reflect.

10:34.940 --> 10:41.940
But now Italians have come here. The soul
had to come to the spirit.

10:45.290 --> 10:52.290
So let us not be materialistic, for a change.
Let us not be mundane but work out your spiritual

11:07.339 --> 11:14.339
hankering through its fulfillment. You have
seen, so many in India, Ajanta, which was

11:20.560 --> 11:27.560
built in eleven centuries, which is built
in a range of half-circular mountains. The

11:39.350 --> 11:46.350
stones were hewed from top to bottom and the
height of some of these is more than eighty

11:49.649 --> 11:56.649
feet, the caves and in eleven centuries how
they worked it out, that first they made a

11:57.779 --> 12:04.779
general plan of it. Then they made the division
of it, like that it went on till it came to

12:05.310 --> 12:12.310
the detailed working. Generations after generations,
in the praise of Lord Buddha whom they had

12:14.470 --> 12:21.470
not seen, they had never known, only in dedication
to Him.

12:22.509 --> 12:29.509
They worked in that jungle, in that forest,
day in and day out, for eleven centuries to

12:33.870 --> 12:40.870
build that Ajanta where even their names are
not there; no one knows who were responsible,

12:42.470 --> 12:49.470
who did it. Without leaving any traces, just
for their emancipation, of expression of their

12:52.040 --> 12:59.040
adoration for Lord Buddha because He talked
of self-realization; only talked, didn’t

13:01.420 --> 13:08.420
give. For eleven generations or may be more
because in one century there are at least

13:09.620 --> 13:16.370
two generations; maybe twenty-one generations
worked, one after another to build that huge

13:16.370 --> 13:23.370
thing of seven miles. And the whole thing
is so smooth, like this, like the tent that

13:29.139 --> 13:36.139
the roof is extremely smooth, as if a tent
has been put up, and even there is this kind

13:39.579 --> 13:46.579
of a looseness, that you can see in this tent
and when the wind blows, how the cloth goes

13:56.690 --> 14:03.690
into folds with all the beautiful paintings
on them, is shown. What was it that made it?

14:14.250 --> 14:21.250
Who was the one who guided them? They had
never seen Buddha.

14:29.310 --> 14:36.310
We have got realization, we’re much higher
people than all of them. We have much more

14:40.089 --> 14:47.089
capacities. Now in Delhi they have discovered
that Sahaja Yogis have a greater resistance

14:47.130 --> 14:54.130
for digestion, skin resistance and when they’re
in thoughtless awareness there are no electrical

14:56.040 --> 15:03.040
charges in the brain. So their brains are
preserved and are going to be very dynamic

15:05.199 --> 15:12.199
for a long time. It’s going to be published
on the eighth of this month.

15:24.800 --> 15:31.800
So one has to know that we are born in a very
dynamic time, historical times. Never before

15:38.040 --> 15:45.040
in history we had so many Sahaja Yogis. This
is the time of the greatest revolution, greatest

15:46.310 --> 15:53.310
evolution
and this is the time you’re going to achieve
something that was never achieved before.

16:00.879 --> 16:07.879
Are we capable of calling ourselves Sahaja
Yogis?

16:10.649 --> 16:17.649
August is a very great month, specially for
Me. Today is also a very great day, I should

16:24.110 --> 16:31.110
say. In the month of August, we got our independence,
as you know, ninth of August, in India. But

16:34.600 --> 16:41.600
before that, in 1942, on the third of August,
Mahatma Gandhi declared the movement of “Quit

16:46.970 --> 16:53.970
India,” of the British from India. And today
on the same day you have welcomed Me in the

17:00.509 --> 17:07.509
heart of the heart, Shoody Camp. Eighth of
August, as you know, is the day when Rabindranath

17:43.799 --> 17:50.799
Tagore was born and in our college we celebrated
eighth of August and I remember it very clearly.

17:55.600 --> 18:02.600
And the ninth
of August we all went on a strike.

18:12.360 --> 18:19.360
In science college I remember I was a young
girl of nineteen years and My professsor and

18:21.640 --> 18:28.640
My principal still remember all those things
that happened. I was standing alone and behind

18:29.210 --> 18:35.159
Me were all the students who were doing the
strike. When the military came in and they

18:35.159 --> 18:40.580
tried to threaten and do all kinds of things
to Me. I said, “No, we’ll not enter into

18:40.580 --> 18:46.179
the college, today is the strike day.” When
My principal came and he was very happy and

18:46.179 --> 18:52.110
they removed him for that. He has written
a very nice letter to Me when he met Me the

18:52.110 --> 18:59.110
other day, when he saw Me as Mataji Nirmala
Devi. It was a letter worth really remembering.

19:00.890 --> 19:07.890
So this is the month of a very big change
and revolution in India. But with that one

19:12.080 --> 19:19.080
has to remember that “Quit India” movement
started all right and all kinds of sacrifices

19:20.070 --> 19:27.070
were done, people sacrificed so much that
you cannot imagine how much people have to

19:28.490 --> 19:35.490
sacrifice. As today in South Africa, people
are sacrificing so much for their freedom,

19:35.720 --> 19:42.720
much worse than in India, much worse. People
sacrificed and sacrificed. As a result of

19:46.500 --> 19:53.500
those sacrifices, we got our independence
and we have to thank the Labour government

19:53.890 --> 20:00.890
for that. If Mr. Attlee was not chosen by
the Divine we would never have got our independence.

20:04.650 --> 20:11.650
We got our independence and graciously English
left us, that was something really great of

20:11.720 --> 20:18.720
them, in those days to do it. But that independence
was just a political independence, political

20:21.350 --> 20:28.350
freedom but today you have the ultimate, ultimate
freedom. You got the freedom of your spirit

20:33.179 --> 20:40.179
which is not attached to anything, which is
not anything but the spirit, which is absolute,

20:40.659 --> 20:47.659
which is neither English nor Indian nor Australian,
which is not this house, which is not anything

20:49.860 --> 20:56.860
but the spirit itself, the complete freedom
you’ve got. In that freedom you have to

20:57.279 --> 21:04.279
rise. Still we have considerations of brothers,
sisters, children, wife; no, you are the spirit.

21:09.029 --> 21:14.480
You have to sacrifice. For Me, nothing is
like sacrificing because I don’t know what

21:14.480 --> 21:21.480
am I sacrificing. In the same way what we
call sacrifice at that stage should be Sahaj

21:26.480 --> 21:33.480
now for us, Sahaj. That time it was a sacrifice
but today it should be Sahaj. We’ve gained

21:37.340 --> 21:44.340
so much in Sahaja Yoga. In that freedom fight,
they gained nothing. But what are we sacrificing?

21:47.520 --> 21:54.520
Just our ego and this is what English have
to come up to. “What have I sacrificed for

22:00.659 --> 22:07.549
Sahaja Yoga? What have I done for Sahaja Yoga?
How much I have exploited it?” We must think

22:07.549 --> 22:12.260
it over; it’s very important.

22:12.260 --> 22:19.260
You left an empire; India was the gem. On
that earning you are still having your doles

22:23.730 --> 22:30.730
today. Such a rich country you left, richest
of all in the whole world was India. You don’t

22:33.330 --> 22:40.330
know how rich India was and is today even
if you see to it. And you left that country,

22:42.770 --> 22:49.770
you are a small country. You don’t have
any riches as such, nothing, but in your greatness

22:51.870 --> 22:58.870
you left it. Nobody will leave like that.
Your forefathers did it. It’s a great sacrifice

23:01.520 --> 23:08.520
I think, from the worldly point of view.

23:11.580 --> 23:18.390
So we have to now understand that, we must
have confidence in ourselves in such a way

23:18.390 --> 23:25.390
that whatever we sacrifice, what do we sacrifice?
In this maya you sacrifice something and how

23:26.230 --> 23:33.029
much you get out of it. Just the maya is testing
you.

23:33.029 --> 23:40.029
So for today you have sacrificed a lot, given
lot of money to have this house, and I know

23:47.940 --> 23:53.899
that. You’ll be amazed I’m not worried
about My own money, how much it is spent here

23:53.899 --> 24:00.899
and there. But for your money I’m very hard
on all of them and the leaders might be thinking

24:02.770 --> 24:09.770
I’m so miserly but this is public money,
not only public, this is the blood of My children.

24:11.480 --> 24:18.480
So again on this great occasion, this joyous
occasion, in the month of August we’re having

24:24.710 --> 24:31.710
this beautiful place now and with this one
we’ll have many in future. I hope we’ll

24:37.679 --> 24:44.679
occupy the whole place quite a lot. Already
the neighbors must have run away

24:55.679 --> 25:02.679
and we’re going to manage somehow or other
to purchase all these places here. You have

25:08.010 --> 25:15.010
to desire it. Behind every desire there has
to be the action and in that action you have

25:16.080 --> 25:23.080
to sacrifice. But if you say it laboriously,
“I’m sacrificing, sacrificing,” it’s

25:24.820 --> 25:31.320
not a divine thing to do, should be done in
such a joyous way.

25:31.320 --> 25:38.320
I hope now, today you will all promise Me
that every morning you’re going to meditate,

25:43.399 --> 25:49.840
every morning, everyone, no excuses, you’re
not going to excuse yourself. Unless and until

25:49.840 --> 25:56.840
you meditate I cannot do what I want to do
in Shoody Camp. No laziness, no excuses, no

25:59.100 --> 26:06.100
telling lies, not deceiving yourself; all
of you are going to meditate, that is one

26:06.570 --> 26:13.570
promise. And the rest I’ll look after, the
rest I will look after. You’ll just decide

26:21.340 --> 26:28.340
to meditate everyday, everyday. That’s one
more thing you have to give Me is the promise

26:33.220 --> 26:40.220
that you will all meditate everyday in the
morning time and evening time if you do foot-soaking

26:40.909 --> 26:47.909
is good for you, not for Me. Everything’s
so spontaneous, so beautiful, how it has worked

26:58.279 --> 26:58.760
out.

26:58.760 --> 27:04.480
Now to end it up I’ll give you a very good
example of manifestation of another miracle

27:04.480 --> 27:11.480
that has taken place, how it works out. You
know we have bought a plot of land of forty-two

27:12.409 --> 27:19.409
acres in Vaitarna for the education of children.
And the Bombay people went there and planted

27:20.610 --> 27:27.610
some three hundred trees and also they had
a paddy farming started there. Before the

27:34.220 --> 27:39.350
school starts they thought something should
be done about it. But the villagers around

27:39.350 --> 27:45.360
would bring their cattle, their cows, and
their goats and all of them to graze in that

27:45.360 --> 27:51.010
ground. So they got very much worried and
the Sahaja Yogis in Vaitarna also said that,

27:51.010 --> 27:56.220
“You shouldn’t this, this is Mother’s
land.” Again they had a meeting of the villagers,

27:56.220 --> 28:03.220
they told, “This is Mother’s land, you
better not come here.” They wouldn’t listen

28:03.799 --> 28:05.110
to them.

28:05.110 --> 28:12.110
And one day suddenly in the daytime a very
big tiger appeared, very big tiger, of a very

28:13.710 --> 28:20.710
large size. And he started roaring and jumping
all over, running all over the place whatever

28:21.460 --> 28:27.010
we had purchased and all that. And everyday
he did it for five days and they got such

28:27.010 --> 28:34.010
a fright that they took away their lock, stock
and barrel, as you say, and everything. Their

28:36.760 --> 28:43.760
cattle and their everything they took away,
tied it together and all of them. They’ve

28:45.130 --> 28:52.130
also removed their huts, I’m told, they’re
so frightened. And this tiger is nobody else

28:53.529 --> 29:00.529
but is Bhairavanathji. He does that and you
know that He’s St. George who’s working

29:02.480 --> 29:09.480
so very hard. Nobody has seen a tiger there
the last thirty years and that area is not

29:09.690 --> 29:16.690
known at all for tigers and such a big tiger,
they said.

29:30.830 --> 29:34.570
So thank you very much, may God bless you.

29:34.570 --> 29:41.169
Now if you want to give Me flowers you can
do that and also I would request you to have

29:41.169 --> 29:48.169
your food, it’s very late already. And do
you want to have some music or something after

29:48.179 --> 29:55.179
that? You can have, what’s the harm? You
could have your food here if you like. It’s

29:58.049 --> 30:01.169
quite a warm place isn’t it? Is there a
heater here? No? You all should freeze in

30:01.169 --> 30:01.730
this place.

30:01.730 --> 30:01.980
There are so many sayings in English language,
if you just pay attention to it. One of them

30:01.730 --> 30:02.279
is: oranges and lemons, sold for a penny;
that’s for our, you see, treatment, with

30:02.279 --> 30:04.210
the lemons we have. And there’s another
one: London Bridge is falling down, suggesting

30:04.210 --> 30:08.950
that what we believe into, all these bridges
is not important. The bridge with God has

30:08.950 --> 30:15.460
to be built and expressing that material things
should fall down. And then: Humpty Dumpty

30:15.460 --> 30:15.710
sat on a wall. There are so many things that
explain that people knew what it was going

30:15.700 --> 30:15.950
to be.

30:15.730 --> 30:15.980
It’s so surprising that there’s a poet
called Lewis. He has written, I don’t know

30:15.929 --> 30:16.200
if you have read it or not, have you brought
that? I wish you had. About the procession

30:16.200 --> 30:17.269
he saw in India of you people, you haven’t
got it? How many of you have read that? That’s

30:17.269 --> 30:17.990
very exclusive! Surprising, nobody has that.
All right, tomorrow. Remember all that you

30:17.990 --> 30:18.669
have to get from there. Mr. Djamel has to
bring many things, I think.

30:18.669 --> 30:18.919
Also there’s a Commonwealth meeting going
on, better give bandhan, specially to our

30:18.740 --> 30:18.990
Indian Prime Minister who is a realized soul
and they were telling Me that all the terrorists

30:18.820 --> 30:19.070
have joined together to kill him. And our
High Commissioner also, his wife told Me that

30:18.909 --> 30:19.159
all the terrorists have arrived.

30:18.929 --> 30:19.179
Do you know in London, who rules? St. George.
How dare anybody touch that. St. George rules

30:19.019 --> 30:19.269
there, so we don’t need a tiger. It’s
all right, He’s already there, settled down.

30:19.100 --> 30:19.350
Thank you very much, all these and I went
to…, beautiful, all right. These are all

30:19.179 --> 30:19.429
wild flowers, you’ll be amazed the country
has such an abundance of these wonderful flowers

30:19.250 --> 30:19.500
and so unique. See this one is Ganesha’s
flower here, see this one is the wild flower,
