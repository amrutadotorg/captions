00:08.740 --> 00:14.770
So the principle of ascent

00:14.931 --> 00:16.599
is to be in the center,

00:16.760 --> 00:18.610
to be in the balance,

00:18.771 --> 00:21.091
to be in the maryadas of the center.

00:21.252 --> 00:25.404
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

00:26.464 --> 00:30.068
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

00:30.229 --> 00:32.399
to the maryadas?

00:35.454 --> 00:38.344
Then we get caught up.

00:38.693 --> 00:42.844
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

00:43.005 --> 00:45.464
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

00:46.241 --> 00:48.211
Say we have the maryadas,

00:48.372 --> 00:53.404
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

00:55.434 --> 01:00.421
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

01:00.582 --> 01:03.592
on all the sides of the void,

01:04.601 --> 01:08.731
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

01:11.545 --> 01:14.595
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

01:15.395 --> 01:19.511
and to keep to the boundaries

01:19.672 --> 01:21.811
is difficult when you have two problems:

01:21.972 --> 01:25.494
one is the ego, another is the superego.

01:27.039 --> 01:31.069
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

01:31.474 --> 01:35.414
Ego is the problem, and it has very, very subtle implications now,

01:35.574 --> 01:39.564
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

01:41.127 --> 01:44.127
One is a gross,

01:44.288 --> 01:46.784
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

01:46.945 --> 01:50.955
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

01:52.201 --> 01:57.151
That one is the one,

01:59.001 --> 02:02.991
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

02:05.363 --> 02:10.413
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

02:14.722 --> 02:19.959
then he behaves in this manner only

02:20.120 --> 02:26.112
that he doesn’t know how to hide his ego in sophistication.

02:26.292 --> 02:29.166
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

02:29.327 --> 02:33.347
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

02:34.594 --> 02:36.444
Like in English language we’ll say,

02:36.605 --> 02:40.455
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

02:44.527 --> 02:48.487
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

02:50.454 --> 02:52.293
It’s such a devious thing,

02:52.454 --> 02:54.304
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

02:54.464 --> 02:58.384
that means you have put a chocolate on top of that, isn’t it?

02:58.544 --> 03:01.334
Such a camouflage, must understand.

03:01.494 --> 03:03.314
See we must face as we are,

03:03.474 --> 03:06.394
we cannot be facing something else.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.468
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

03:09.629 --> 03:13.569
that we avoid facing ourselves.

03:15.575 --> 03:19.742
Today though the day is of celebration

03:19.903 --> 03:22.044
so in all humor we should understand

03:22.205 --> 03:25.344
what this stupid thing called ego is.

03:25.504 --> 03:27.607
In all humor, not in seriousness,

03:27.768 --> 03:30.618
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

03:33.715 --> 03:38.344
Now as I was explaining in the morning

03:38.504 --> 03:42.303
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

03:42.464 --> 03:46.036
I mean even before going to the hall,

03:46.197 --> 03:50.575
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

03:50.736 --> 03:53.731
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

03:53.892 --> 03:55.669
I mean all the time it has been there

03:55.830 --> 03:57.978
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

03:58.139 --> 04:00.122
It has never vanished.

04:00.283 --> 04:02.314
So this chakra is all the time working,

04:02.474 --> 04:06.534
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

04:08.270 --> 04:09.464
So what happens really,

04:09.624 --> 04:11.384
we should see the physical side of it,

04:11.544 --> 04:14.004
it’s very important to understand.

04:14.165 --> 04:17.444
You see from childhood if we are taught

04:17.605 --> 04:21.176
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

04:21.337 --> 04:24.437
you have to achieve something, some success or this and that,

04:24.598 --> 04:28.683
then the idea of strength is given to you,

04:28.844 --> 04:32.957
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

04:33.118 --> 04:36.055
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

04:36.216 --> 04:38.769
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

04:38.930 --> 04:42.441
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

04:42.602 --> 04:49.323
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

04:49.484 --> 04:54.894
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

04:55.055 --> 04:58.740
You can never be successful if you do like that.

04:58.900 --> 05:00.919
So unless and until you are possessed

05:01.079 --> 05:04.720
you can never be obedient.

05:04.910 --> 05:06.610
This is what it is.

05:06.770 --> 05:08.590
Somebody has to possess you,

05:08.750 --> 05:11.730
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

05:11.890 --> 05:14.103
then you can be obedient;

05:14.263 --> 05:16.432
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

05:16.593 --> 05:20.671
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

05:20.832 --> 05:23.572
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

05:23.733 --> 05:27.554
everybody wants to have their own way,

05:27.828 --> 05:32.339
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

05:32.499 --> 05:34.910
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

05:35.070 --> 05:37.770
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

05:37.931 --> 05:41.937
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

05:42.098 --> 05:44.783
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

05:44.944 --> 05:48.189
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

05:48.349 --> 05:51.219
they become disobedient.

05:51.511 --> 05:54.964
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

05:55.124 --> 05:57.999
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

05:58.160 --> 06:01.788
obedience is weakness.

06:02.984 --> 06:10.019
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

06:10.179 --> 06:15.620
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

06:15.781 --> 06:18.028
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

06:18.189 --> 06:20.009
and all those things it does burst,

06:20.195 --> 06:23.582
but it is flexible also.

06:23.742 --> 06:29.793
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

06:29.953 --> 06:35.763
superego, then the superego

06:36.160 --> 06:40.150
can go up to a point, it is also there.

06:45.433 --> 06:49.129
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

06:49.289 --> 06:51.674
drugs just to push it back

06:51.835 --> 06:57.914
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

06:58.078 --> 07:02.226
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

07:02.387 --> 07:04.898
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

07:05.059 --> 07:10.073
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

07:10.347 --> 07:14.347
Otherwise ego is too much.

07:14.563 --> 07:19.031
So when somebody says something to you,

07:19.421 --> 07:21.511
instead of facing up to it

07:21.672 --> 07:25.532
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

07:25.692 --> 07:30.542
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

07:31.116 --> 07:35.472
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

07:35.632 --> 07:37.613
Because there’s another place

07:37.773 --> 07:42.552
where this ego can go is when you come round,

07:42.712 --> 07:46.492
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

07:46.652 --> 07:49.195
so when it is suppressed from the other side

07:49.356 --> 07:52.077
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

07:52.238 --> 07:56.898
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

07:57.726 --> 08:01.183
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

08:01.343 --> 08:05.263
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

08:09.283 --> 08:12.408
and that’s how you sulk and think.

08:12.569 --> 08:15.172
Think so you get more ego,

08:15.333 --> 08:21.069
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

08:24.463 --> 08:26.786
Now, the practical way

08:26.947 --> 08:33.648
the central path is established by being in reality.

08:34.898 --> 08:37.551
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

08:37.711 --> 08:40.824
Supposing something has gone wrong,

08:40.984 --> 08:43.744
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

08:43.904 --> 08:45.654
because I’ve done the mistake.

08:45.814 --> 08:47.673
All right, why did I do the mistake?

08:47.834 --> 08:49.952
Because of this, so next time no.”
