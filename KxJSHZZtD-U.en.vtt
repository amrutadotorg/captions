00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.770
So the principle of ascent

00:00:14.931 --> 00:00:16.599
is to be in the center,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.610
to be in the balance,

00:00:18.771 --> 00:00:21.091
to be in the maryadas of the center.

00:00:21.252 --> 00:00:25.404
To be in the boundaries of the center is the principle.

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:30.068
So what happens when we do not keep to the boundaries,

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:32.399
to the maryadas?

00:00:35.454 --> 00:00:38.344
Then we get caught up.

00:00:38.693 --> 00:00:42.844
If we keep to maryadas we can never be caught up.

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:45.464
Many people say, “Why have the maryadas?”

00:00:46.241 --> 00:00:48.211
Say we have the maryadas,

00:00:48.372 --> 00:00:53.404
the boundaries of this beautiful ashram here

00:00:55.434 --> 00:01:00.421
and somebody is attacking you from all the sides,

00:01:00.582 --> 00:01:03.592
on all the sides of the void,

00:01:04.601 --> 00:01:08.731
so if you go out of the void you get caught up.

00:01:11.545 --> 00:01:14.595
That’s why you have to keep to the boundaries,

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:19.511
and to keep to the boundaries

00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:21.811
 is difficult when you have two problems:

00:01:21.972 --> 00:01:25.494
one is the ego, another is the superego.

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.069
Now as in the West superego is not such a problem.

00:01:31.474 --> 00:01:35.414
Ego is the problem, and it has very, very subtle implications now,

00:01:35.574 --> 00:01:39.564
I can see the complicated styles of egos we have.

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:44.127
One is a gross,

00:01:44.288 --> 00:01:46.784
like Khomeini style, which is dry,

00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:50.955
is obvious, evident, everybody can condemn.

00:01:52.201 --> 00:01:57.151
That one is the one,

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.991
either one corrects or gets completely destroyed.

00:02:05.363 --> 00:02:10.413
But ego, if it is of a stupid person,

00:02:14.722 --> 00:02:19.959
then he behaves in this manner only

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:26.112
that he doesn’t know how to hide his ego in sophistication.

00:02:26.292 --> 00:02:29.166
But the Western ego is extremely sophisticated;

00:02:29.327 --> 00:02:33.347
the language, everything, is very sophisticated.

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:36.444
Like in English language we’ll say,

00:02:36.605 --> 00:02:40.455
“I’m afraid I have to slap you.”

00:02:44.527 --> 00:02:48.487
“I’m sorry I have to kill you.”

00:02:50.454 --> 00:02:52.293
It’s such a devious thing,

00:02:52.454 --> 00:02:54.304
you see, once you’ve said “I’m sorry”

00:02:54.464 --> 00:02:58.384
that means you have put a chocolate on top of that, isn’t it?

00:02:58.544 --> 00:03:01.334
Such a camouflage, must understand.

00:03:01.494 --> 00:03:03.314
See we must face as we are,

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:06.394
we cannot be facing something else.

00:03:06.554 --> 00:03:09.468
But this is exactly what happens with sophistication,

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.569
that we avoid facing ourselves.

00:03:15.575 --> 00:03:19.742
Today though the day is of celebration

00:03:19.903 --> 00:03:22.044
so in all humor we should understand

00:03:22.205 --> 00:03:25.344
what this stupid thing called ego is.

00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:27.607
In all humor, not in seriousness,

00:03:27.768 --> 00:03:30.618
for I don’t want you again to feel guilty.

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:38.344
Now as I was explaining in the morning

00:03:38.504 --> 00:03:42.303
how ego becomes the Left Vishuddhi.

00:03:42.464 --> 00:03:46.036
I mean even before going to the hall,

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:50.575
My attention on the hall, I get a big lump here

00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:53.731
- just, just painful horrible, excruciating.

00:03:53.892 --> 00:03:55.669
I mean all the time it has been there

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.978
since I’ve been in the West. Can you imagine?

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:00.122
It has never vanished.

00:04:00.283 --> 00:04:02.314
So this chakra is all the time working,

00:04:02.474 --> 00:04:06.534
poor thing is so much now tired, Vishnumaya’s chakra.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:09.464
So what happens really,

00:04:09.624 --> 00:04:11.384
we should see the physical side of it,

00:04:11.544 --> 00:04:14.004
it’s very important to understand.

00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:17.444
You see from childhood if we are taught

00:04:17.605 --> 00:04:21.176
in a society like this, where you are an extrovert,

00:04:21.337 --> 00:04:24.437
you have to achieve something, some success or this and that,

00:04:24.598 --> 00:04:28.683
then the idea of strength is given to you,

00:04:28.844 --> 00:04:32.957
that it is weakness to tolerate something.

00:04:33.118 --> 00:04:36.055
Imagine in Christian nations that’s the best part of it,

00:04:36.216 --> 00:04:38.769
“I’m sorry I will kill you,” sort of a thing.

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:42.441
In Christian nation, you see, they have this thing, theory

00:04:42.602 --> 00:04:49.323
that it is weakness that if you tolerate anything.

00:04:49.484 --> 00:04:54.894
It is a weakness if you get dominated by someone.

00:04:55.055 --> 00:04:58.740
You can never be successful if you do like that.

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:00.919
So unless and until you are possessed

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:04.720
you can never be obedient.

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:06.610
This is what it is.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.590
Somebody has to possess you,

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.730
absolutely possess you like Hitler,

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.103
then you can be obedient;

00:05:14.263 --> 00:05:16.432
otherwise everybody has a big ego,

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:20.671
as I had told you the story of the garbage cleaner.

00:05:20.832 --> 00:05:23.572
So everybody has a very, very big ego,

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:27.554
everybody wants to have their own way,

00:05:27.828 --> 00:05:32.339
and from childhood you spoil your children too much,

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:34.910
you spoil them, completely spoil them.

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:37.770
All the time you‘ll hug them, you’ll hold them,

00:05:37.931 --> 00:05:41.937
you’ll do too much, children get spoiled.

00:05:42.098 --> 00:05:44.783
Think no end of themselves and then on top of that,

00:05:44.944 --> 00:05:48.189
if you tell them that you should not tolerate anything,

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:51.219
they become disobedient.

00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:54.964
So you do not know how to obey others in any way.

00:05:55.124 --> 00:05:57.999
Ego does not know how to obey, because that is weakness,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.788
obedience is weakness.

00:06:02.984 --> 00:06:10.019
So now this poor thing ego has a limited, limited thing.

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:15.620
That is, this ego has a balloon, which is limited.

00:06:15.781 --> 00:06:18.028
But it bursts when you get your paralysis

00:06:18.189 --> 00:06:20.009
and all those things it does burst,

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:23.582
but it is flexible also.

00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:29.793
So when the ego starts getting too much on top of the

00:06:29.953 --> 00:06:35.763
superego, then the superego

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.150
can go up to a point, it is also there.

00:06:45.433 --> 00:06:49.129
So to get rid of the ego people take drinks,

00:06:49.289 --> 00:06:51.674
drugs just to push it back

00:06:51.835 --> 00:06:57.914
so, increase the superego so the ego comes down.

00:06:58.078 --> 00:07:02.226
So you are playing between, then you have a hangover,

00:07:02.387 --> 00:07:04.898
then it goes on like this, you see, works out.

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:10.073
This is the modern solution they find for ego, all right.

00:07:10.347 --> 00:07:14.347
Otherwise ego is too much.

00:07:14.563 --> 00:07:19.031
So when somebody says something to you,

00:07:19.421 --> 00:07:21.511
instead of facing up to it

00:07:21.672 --> 00:07:25.532
- supposing you find you have not been able to, say,

00:07:25.692 --> 00:07:30.542
find a glass for Me, a simple thing like, take it like that.

00:07:31.116 --> 00:07:35.472
You sulk. Why? Why should you sulk for that?

00:07:35.632 --> 00:07:37.613
Because there’s another place

00:07:37.773 --> 00:07:42.552
where this ego can go is when you come round,

00:07:42.712 --> 00:07:46.492
you see here it crosses at Vishuddhi,

00:07:46.652 --> 00:07:49.195
so when it is suppressed from the other side

00:07:49.356 --> 00:07:52.077
it goes into that Vishuddhi part.

00:07:52.238 --> 00:07:56.898
So then you get the Left Vishuddhi,

00:07:57.726 --> 00:08:01.183
it is nothing but pure ego. Believe Me, it’s pure ego,

00:08:01.343 --> 00:08:05.263
because it has no other way to get in, it goes there

00:08:09.283 --> 00:08:12.408
and that’s how you sulk and think.

00:08:12.569 --> 00:08:15.172
Think so you get more ego,

00:08:15.333 --> 00:08:21.069
you fill up your left side and you sulk, you never face.

00:08:24.463 --> 00:08:26.786
Now, the practical way

00:08:26.947 --> 00:08:33.648
the central path is established by being in reality.

00:08:34.898 --> 00:08:37.551
Now as a matter of habit you must develop.

00:08:37.711 --> 00:08:40.824
Supposing something has gone wrong,

00:08:40.984 --> 00:08:43.744
tell yourself, “Yes it has gone wrong,

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:45.654
because I’ve done the mistake.

00:08:45.814 --> 00:08:47.673
All right, why did I do the mistake?

00:08:47.834 --> 00:08:49.952
Because of this, so next time no.”
