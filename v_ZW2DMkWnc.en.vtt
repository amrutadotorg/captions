00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:05.840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.440
May God give you wisdom and understanding

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.840
about the truth and about Himself.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.400
Doctor Warren just now brought out a point

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.600
that if somebody is doing this work

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.360
in a split of a second, even

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.240
on the television when it was only one minute, if it works out,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.600
then there has to be somebody special.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.040
All this kind of talk

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.120
is not necessary in India,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.360
because Indians are well educated in spiritual matters.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.360
They know what is the Shakti is, what is Kundalini is.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.280
They know the chakras.

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.320
They are very well equipped.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.720
They have got the names of the Shakti in which it is said so.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.560
So to them it is not to be told and requested.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.520
But in the West, though such great saints have been born,

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.400
such seekers are born,

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.160
they have forgotten the knowledge that they had,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.320
perhaps, of the power of God.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.240
And that's why I find the sensitivity of people

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.000
is not towards understanding the reality,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.480
but more they take to artificial things.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.720
Perhaps the more we are in contact with machine,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.080
we become more akin

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.640
or close to machine.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.840
We try to understand everything in a machine-like manner,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.560
but not in that sensitive way, that people had once upon a time.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.200
Even at the time of Christ,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:13.160
except for few Jews who didn't like Him

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.560
because they wanted to have their own money-making propositions,

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.640
they crucified Him.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.480
Even the judge who judged Him,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.800
his wife could understand that He was a saint.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.080
And the people around Him,

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.120
who were simple people,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.440
all of them knew that He was something saintly.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.440
Even at the time of Shri Krishna and Shri Rama, it has happened.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:50.160
I agree that many saints have been crucified, have been tortured,

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:54.680
but not by the general public, by general people.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.640
It has been done by people who were in power,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.480
or who were prophesying some sort of a religion,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.080
who thought that their religion is in danger

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.920
because they were making money out of that religion.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.280
These are the people who did all these atrocities

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.560
and they brought forth this kind of calamity

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.120
or this kind of torture to the great saints who lived.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.280
But today is just the other way round.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:22.320
The public is not sensitive enough.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.520
That's a very hard thing to feel that the public itself

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:33.080
is not understanding what is the truth and how to come to the truth.

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.200
Yesterday in short I told you,

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.600
first of all we have to be honest people

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.320
if you want to find the truth.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.280
Is a simple proposition that we have to be honest about it,

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.000
that we should know that we cannot purchase the truth.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.240
Secondly, the truth is what it is.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:56.200
Whatever are your own conceptions about truth is not the truth.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.760
Is your own idea, your mental projection.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:03.400
Truth is what it is. It will be for ever and ever.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.040
And truth cannot compromise for you.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.240
You have to compromise for the truth.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.520
It is the other way round thing,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:14.400
that you have to compromise for the truth.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.840
You have to understand that so far those concepts you had,

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:21.320
relatively if they are not near the truth,

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.040
then you have to give them out.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:24.760
It's a very strange thing

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.760
that you great people who are seekers,

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.400
are born in various countries,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:33.720
in so many countries, I find.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.440
And then at this juncture,

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:41.920
when it is not because there is so much sickness and all that.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.040
But is a special time also.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.160
Is a time of resurrection.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.840
Is the time of your last judgment.

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.440
At this great times,

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:57.280
that people should lose their sensitivity to reality.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:02.520
It is amazing how people take to artificial things.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.160
So many things people have done just because

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.800
they could not see through.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.640
That's why I requested you yesterday,

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.680
you must come to some logical conclusion.

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.240
You must use your brains and understand

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.480
that reality, if it lies within you

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.960
and if it is a living process of your evolution,

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.600
then it has to be done

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.680
in a way that is not done by human beings,

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.560
because no living work is done by human beings. It cannot be done.

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.640
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit,

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.080
leave alone a human being into a spirit.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:47.840
So, it has to be done by the same process

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.160
which has made us human beings,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.760
and the same process that is living force of God's love,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:59.960
of living God's love, should do the job.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.680
So it has to be spontaneous.

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.120
You cannot achieve it through your efforts.

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:08.280
Actually, those who tell you like that,

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:10.200
that "You have to achieve it through your efforts,"

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:11.360
or, "You have got your karmas.

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.920
You have got to suffer," and all that,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:14.800
are just giving excuses.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.440
They don't know how to achieve it.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.120
They are just giving excuses.

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.120
You must understand that if you have got that power within you,

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.640
it has to manifest spontaneously.

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:30.040
For example, some people may not get realization.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:34.440
May be little bit, very little bit percentage, I hope,

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:35.560
may not get it.

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:37.640
But that is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.600
There must be something wrong within you,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.480
physically, mentally, emotionally.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:44.240
There must be something wrong.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.800
So we have to correct it

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.400
and we have to see that you get your realization

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:55.640
in a proper way and that it is achieved

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:00.760
through your own understanding, in your own glory.

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:04.360
That you should know that you have got your realization.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:06.000
This is the only difference

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:10.240
between the evolutionary process so far from animal to this stage,

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.520
that human beings will be aware of their realization.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.440
They will know all about it

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.440
because now they have become masters,

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:23.560
that they are not doing things automatically.

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:26.960
They will know that this power is flowing through them

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.520
and they will also know how to handle it,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.080
which can be decode through Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:37.600
And you have to learn the technique of operating God's laws,

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:42.280
which are tremendous and wonderful.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:46.120
You believe it or not: God exists.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:50.040
His loving power is all-pervading.

00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:51.720
We have never felt it before.

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:54.400
I agree there, you have never felt that

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.040
His all-pervading power is everywhere.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:07:59.080
You have felt the ether,

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:03.320
through which we receive the television and other communications,

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.160
but you have not felt that subtle power,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.600
which is all-pervading, not only but that,

00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:12.520
but is the subtle of all these gross that you see.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:15.160
But the time has come,

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.680
very precious time, that you have to get it.

00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:21.120
So all your other identifications,

00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:23.280
I am sorry, you have to drop them.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.920
You have to just become yourself.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:26.680
Whatever you have gathered in life time,

00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.280
all kinds of concepts, and precepts and all that, forget it.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:33.840
Just think that you are a human being

00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:35.800
and you have to get your realization.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:37.640
That's the most important thing.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.680
All the rest of things are of no use.

00:08:40.920 --> 00:08:43.560
So I would request you first of all,

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:48.000
in all honesty, try to be the spirit.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:49.720
And if you become the spirit,

00:08:49.960 --> 00:08:55.800
try to understand the path of progress in your spiritual ascent.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:09:01.040
Now to come to the point of this

00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.440
subtle instrument already created within us,

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:09.040
to come to this point we have to understand,

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:14.080
as I told you yesterday that this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:15.960
Whatever you have so far,

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:18.400
is the knowledge of the tree.

00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:22.320
But you don't have any knowledge of the roots.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:24.040
Many people have told me,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.160
"Mother, what Christianity has failed.

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.360
That religion has failed. This religion has failed.

00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:31.840
How can it be? If there is God, how can it be?"

00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:33.360
I mean, there are communists also in this world

00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:35.720
who deny God completely.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.400
But is not that the religions have failed;

00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.480
not the prophets have failed;

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:44.400
not the incarnations have failed.

00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:46.400
It's the people who represented them,

00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.160
wanted to make something of their own,

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.160
of their own concept, of their ideas,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.560
and the whole thing has become such a market place,

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:57.240
that I just don't understand.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.840
How can you sell God?

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:00.960
How can you sell His ideas?

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:04.840
There is no business about God.

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:09.840
Now this one is the great instrument that you have within yourself.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.240
Yesterday I told you that you need not accept Me

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:18.360
as a sort of a conditioning on your mind.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:22.640
But as a scientist, keep an open mind.

00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:25.720
And this is the hypothesis I put before you,

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.680
and when it works out,

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.840
you have to see if it is all right or not.

00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:35.640
Now some of you who might be doubting about it,

00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.480
or thinking that, "Oh, it's all another story," or things like that.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:41.160
They can go ahead with it

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.240
because Divine is not interested in such people.

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:46.520
Divine is only interested in people

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:50.240
who are honestly seeking the truth.

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.600
So this center that you see the first of all,

00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:57.400
is a very important center.

00:10:57.640 --> 00:10:59.720
I don't know what he has told you about it,

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:02.400
but is called as the Mooladhara.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:06.120
It's the center of Mooladhara,

00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:08.800
center of Mooladhara.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:12.600
Mooladhara itself is that triangular bone,

00:11:12.840 --> 00:11:16.200
which is a very small triangle. You cannot see it clearly.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:19.080
We should have expanded it to show you,

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.640
which contains in itself

00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.160
the power of Kundalini.

00:11:26.400 --> 00:11:30.840
Is the power of that energy, which I told you yesterday,

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.160
is the pure desire to become one with God.

00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:39.480
All other desires are not satiable.

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:43.400
That's why this is the only desire that has to manifest.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.400
Otherwise, you are not going to be satisfied with your life.

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:53.520
Now, this pure desire exists in that triangular bone,

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:59.360
and you could see it also when you raise the Kundalini,

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.960
is pulsating there just like a heart.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:07.000
But not on every person. Not on every seeker.

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:11.160
Only those who have a problem with the other two centers,

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:16.840
you can see with your naked eye, the pulsation of the Kundalini.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:20.160
When there is such a pulsation of the Kundalini,

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.840
we have to know that these two centers

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.760
are in problem in human beings.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:28.240
And these two centers are,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.000
the higher one is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:37.120
which means the center, the subtler center of the navel.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.280
And this center manifests outside,

00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:45.240
what we call the solar plexus.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:48.160
In the medical terminology is called as solar plexus.

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.960
But that's the gross thing.

00:12:50.160 --> 00:12:51.480
This is the subtle center

00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:55.000
which is in the medulla oblongata in the spinal cord.

00:12:55.240 --> 00:12:58.600
Now this is a very, very important center within us again,

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:03.000
which was created since long, when we were seeking.

00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.080
First, as animals we were seeking food.

00:13:06.360 --> 00:13:08.640
Then also we were seeking our evolution.

00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.960
Because animals also sought

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:15.320
their ascent

00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:18.280
from a one-unicellular animal

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:20.720
to a multi-cellular animal,

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:24.000
like all the quadrupeds are or the mammals are.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:28.600
How they arrived it, is no one can say.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:31.160
because the power that worked for it,

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.480
lies in the central path of this central Nadi

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:39.840
called as Sushumna Nadi.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.560
So first we were seeking the food.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:50.360
Then we were seeking the shelter, as you go by in the history.

00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.000
Then as we evolved more and more,

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:58.400
we started seeking our joy in, say, economics,

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:03.440
in possessions, then in politics, in power.

00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:06.040
Then we evolved much more

00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:08.480
and we thought there is no joy in all these things.

00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.760
We have had enough of it.

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:11.840
Specially the affluence helped you a lot.

00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.800
Because affluent people get fed-up of materialism,

00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:17.320
and the plastic mountains that they have created.

00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:20.840
And they just want to have something simple in life.

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:26.600
At this stage then they start thinking of their spirit.

00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:29.800
They think, "How is it that we are not yet satisfied?

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.120
How is it we are so restless? What are we seeking?"

00:14:33.400 --> 00:14:35.440
Some of them know what they are seeking.

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:37.800
Some of them don't know what they are seeking,

00:14:38.040 --> 00:14:39.800
but even if they know what they are seeking,

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:43.760
they don't know how it will happen, and what should we expect.

00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.520
That's a very important thing

00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:49.440
where I find Indian people are better equipped.

00:14:49.640 --> 00:14:51.640
But you have another great equipment,

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:55.400
that your desire to seek is very strong,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:59.680
is extremely strong, and you go like a bull at it.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.040
I have seen people who got realization,

00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:06.520
and they were running so fast towards it

00:15:06.720 --> 00:15:08.640
that even after getting realization

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:11.040
they would not accept that they have sought it.

00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:13.760
They would not stop, you see. Like a bull is running very fast,

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.160
you see, even if you offer him something to eat

00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:17.800
he won't be able to stop at that point.

00:15:18.040 --> 00:15:20.720
He goes little ahead then he looks back, "Yes, that's it."

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.000
So he comes back.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.200
It has happened with so many people

00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:27.720
who have done a kind of a guru-shopping,

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:30.720
I would call it, it's a habit.

00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:33.800
They take a bag in the hand with little money,

00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:36.400
go round in the shop, "Now which guru is available?"

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:40.400
So they go to one guru, "All right, no good, hopeless."

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.600
Then he goes to another guru, third one.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:49.400
And Sahaja Yoga is a temple somewhere away from that market.

00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:53.640
So that habit is also formed in human beings of seeking

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:59.400
that even being introduced to Sahaja Yoga

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.840
and even after becoming the spirit

00:16:02.120 --> 00:16:03.840
feeling the all-pervading power,

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:08.320
still they don't want to stop, because the inertia is too much.

00:16:08.520 --> 00:16:10.440
And it's still they are going on.

00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.600
But after some time, they reverse back.

00:16:12.800 --> 00:16:16.240
I've seen many things like that happening in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.120
in every place I went to.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.360
Specially in England is very common

00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:23.280
that in first shot they just can't believe it,

00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.000
"How can it be? It's not so simple."

00:16:25.200 --> 00:16:27.320
Because then their ego is finished.

00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:30.200
They have found it, "How can it be? We can't do it by ourselves."

00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:33.280
So they forget about Sahaja Yoga for a while.

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.480
Then the Kundalini comes and tickles them all over.

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.640
Again She comes and clears them all over.

00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:40.800
Then they start thinking, "What's happening to me?"

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:44.800
And then they come back to Me and say,  "Mother,

00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.720
I must say there was something that had happened.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:49.520
But I, just I was too fast. I was too speedy

00:16:49.760 --> 00:16:51.640
and I just didn't get the glimpse of it."

00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:53.640
All right, settle down now.

00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.840
So that's one thing is always common and it's all right.

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.320
It's excusable; this doesn't matter.

00:16:59.560 --> 00:17:01.560
You take your own time. I am not in a hurry.

00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.480
But Divine is. Divine is in a very great hurry,

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:08.160
and the work has to be done in a very great speed now.

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.400
It is very important that we have to move

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.000
in a very tremendous speed.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.040
So this seeking within us

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:24.080
is surrounded by this ocean of illusion, within ourselves.

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:30.040
This ocean of illusion comes to us because of our ignorance.

00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:34.040
We see things which do not exist.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:37.800
For example, there is a gentleman who comes to us.

00:17:38.040 --> 00:17:40.080
He is very sweet to talk to.

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:44.280
And after sometime we find that we are missing our purse.

00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:48.280
It's gone. He was very nice, very well-dressed.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:49.600
Then how is it he's vanished?

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.000
Most of the bank robbers are very well-dressed people.

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:58.040
And the way they do it, it's surprising, how they befool.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:01.440
Very intelligent people also, by their dress,

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.000
by their methods, and the way they perfect themselves.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:11.080
So what happens that you cannot make out reality,

00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:15.440
and this illusion is in everything we have,

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:19.280
and in that illusion, all the time we are lost.

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:23.120
We feel that, "This is the house I have made.

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.080
What a nice thing I have done. Such a great thing!"

00:18:26.320 --> 00:18:27.560
But if you look at it,

00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:31.120
after all, this is all dead from to the dead.

00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:34.480
You make a chair; then you think, "Oh, I've made a big chair."

00:18:34.720 --> 00:18:36.600
Now this chair is all right,

00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.800
but tomorrow you won't be able to seat on the ground,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:40.680
if you are sitting on the chair.

00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:44.360
So like many illusions we have about things,

00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:48.840
material things also. Say now, if I have, say, a beautiful carpet,

00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.960
like this one. It's not mine, thank God.

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:54.280
But supposing it, I possessed it,

00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:57.680
then I have to go to insurance company.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:59.360
I have to look after it.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:02.640
I should bother now, "Have you given it back to me or not?"

00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.320
But if it is somebody else's, I am enjoying it

00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:08.720
very well and without worrying about it.

00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:11.320
But the idea of possessions also come in.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:16.200
Then there is an idea of relationships also.

00:19:16.440 --> 00:19:18.560
All these are such great illusions.

00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.960
They just open out, absolutely open out,

00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:26.480
as soon as you find the light of spirit in your attention.

00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:30.280
Like in this room when you enter in, you find it's dark.

00:19:30.600 --> 00:19:33.000
You catch hold of a chair. You will say, "The chair is the room."

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:36.320
Somebody will say, "This pillar is the room."

00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.680
Somebody will say something else.

00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.160
But supposing you just push a button, the light comes in.

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:45.280
Then you understand what is this room,

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.520
what is the relationship with each other.

00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:51.360
The whole integrated knowledge

00:19:51.560 --> 00:19:53.840
about this room comes to you, when there is light.

00:19:54.080 --> 00:19:57.840
And this is what one should understand out of enlightenment.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.240
But the illusion is, people think,

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:03.440
that when they are deluded, they are rising.

00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:05.960
The other day somebody asked Me a very funny question

00:20:06.160 --> 00:20:10.840
that, "Is schizophrenia, is it a step to enlightenment?"

00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:12.560
Now can you imagine?

00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.280
But then I heard that there is a very big book written

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:17.200
about this by some gentleman

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:21.080
who says that, "You have to become mad to become

00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.040
a self or a spirit."

00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:25.600
Can you imagine such a stupid thing?

00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.560
It has not happened in any evolution of ours

00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.480
and why should it happen now that we are human beings,

00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.840
so beautifully created,

00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.120
that we have to become mad to become something higher?

00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.720
I have not heard of any mad person

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.760
who becomes higher by becoming mad, so far.

00:20:42.080 --> 00:20:44.280
But this kind of a theory is going on.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.960
So you can imagine, how there are delusions

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:49.800
and how there are illusions

00:20:50.040 --> 00:20:53.360
and there are sources of these negative forces

00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:56.720
which are giving you all the time

00:20:56.960 --> 00:21:00.600
the waves and waves of this illusion that you live in this illusion.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.800
So is doubly crowded, is doubly blackened,

00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:07.360
and that's how if people cannot find the truth,

00:21:07.560 --> 00:21:09.600
I am not surprised about it.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:13.760
Now this place is called as Bhavasagara

00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:18.040
- is the ocean of illusion in which we live.

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:20.080
And we are seekers.

00:21:20.320 --> 00:21:25.560
So this one is bestowed upon by ten valencies that are within us,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.160
because we must keep our valencies all right.

00:21:28.360 --> 00:21:31.680
Even if you are in the, say, ocean,

00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:33.640
our ship should be seaworthy.

00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:36.920
Then any kind of illusion is not going to deter us

00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:38.680
if we are seaworthy.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:42.240
But seaworthy means, we must know if there is a fog,

00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:45.120
how to move in right direction.

00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:48.320
We should know how to overcome all the hazards

00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:51.280
of all kinds of storms and all knowledge

00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.160
should be built-in within us.

00:21:53.400 --> 00:21:55.000
And that built-in knowledge

00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.960
is, this Dharma as they call it, is a religion within you

00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:04.240
not without, but within you, which are ten valencies.

00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:09.840
As the carbon has four valencies, it has ten valencies.

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:15.480
So we have within us already a built-in system

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.720
which gives us this guideline.

00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.920
But the illusion is such that in that illusion

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:24.920
we develop another problem,

00:22:25.120 --> 00:22:28.160
and that is we never listen to right people.

00:22:28.400 --> 00:22:33.040
The right people are the ten Primordial Masters

00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.520
who came on this earth.

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.480
They have had many other masters also,

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.240
not that they were not right.

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:42.600
But major ten Primordial Masters came on this earth

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.640
and they gave us complete knowledge

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:47.800
as to how to balance ourselves

00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:50.560
and keep to ourselves as human beings.

00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.960
But then the question can be asked, "Why this balance? For what?

00:22:54.240 --> 00:22:56.360
Why should we have this balance?"

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.840
First of all, to keep a good health.

00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.360
Secondly, to have a very good nature.

00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.600
Thirdly, to live like a human being with others

00:23:08.840 --> 00:23:13.720
and not like donkeys or like lions.

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.840
It is a balancing thing which gives you a proper balance

00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:23.320
to have a proper society, a proper [UNCLEAR ] life

00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:25.720
in which you lead a normal life.

00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:28.200
And you are not on your own,

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:31.600
by which you are in relation with the whole.

00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:36.920
Now you see the relationship is from there to the whole.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:41.480
But last of all, this balance is important

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:44.560
that you should achieve your ascent.

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.840
Any aeroplane which has got only one wheel will not fly.

00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.720
Though it has to fly in the air but it has to have two wheels;

00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:53.480
it has to have a balance.

00:23:53.680 --> 00:23:56.000
An imbalanced thing cannot fly up.

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.920
That's why we have to have the balance.

00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:02.360
And that is why these Prophets have taught us the methods

00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:05.240
of how to balance, balance ourselves,

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.480
keep ourselves in balance and don't go to extremes.

00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.560
But whatever they might try,

00:24:10.840 --> 00:24:12.160
whatever they may say,

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:15.720
we just go in the opposite direction

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.280
of what they have told us.

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:21.600
And we really go into an extreme condition of fanaticism

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:24.120
or some sort of a torture to ourselves,

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:28.240
or some sort of a great harm to our being.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:30.240
That's human nature.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:32.680
That I cannot explain. Why so?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.040
Why they are anxious to ruin themselves,

00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:36.920
this is beyond Me to understand,

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.320
because God has tried His level best to make you happy.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.320
He has tried to give you everything,

00:24:42.520 --> 00:24:44.520
but if you are bent upon ruining yourself,

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:45.840
what can you do?

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:47.400
You see the sun is shining,

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.680
and is giving the sunshine to everyone,

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.200
but if some leaves want to get inside the mud,

00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:55.680
what can the sun do?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:59.080
I mean, it is like, "Come, bull, and hit me,"

00:24:59.280 --> 00:25:02.080
sort of a process people take to.

00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:03.640
I don't know why they take it.

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.760
This you may be able to explain better, but to My simple mind,

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.440
I just don't understand.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:12.800
So these things happen to us by which we try to ruin ourselves.

00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:16.600
Now the first of all, as they said about the curing part of it,

00:25:16.800 --> 00:25:18.280
which I must talk to you about,

00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.120
because it is not such an important thing in Sahaja Yoga,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:25.800
there is no,

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.320
no accent on curing.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:32.200
I mean, we don't say that, "We cure this and cure that." I mean,

00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:37.080
it's not a hospital going on here, nothing of the kind.

00:25:37.320 --> 00:25:40.360
It's just that if you get your realization,

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:43.400
as a bi-product you get well. That's it is.

00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:46.400
But you see suddenly people ask you questions,

00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:50.200
"Can you cure this? Can you?" I don't say, "I cure it."

00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.640
You are going to cure yourself through your own ascent.

00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:55.680
It can work out through Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:58.200
And then it becomes a headline for everyone,

00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:00.560
"She can cure this disease, She can…"

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:03.240
It was surprising that even in the television

00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:06.440
they had put Me as a healer and I was amazed to look at Myself.

00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:07.840
What is this they have put it?

00:26:08.120 --> 00:26:11.200
So they make out of you whatever they like.

00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:16.320
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not the healing that is important,

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:18.520
it is becoming is important.

00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.320
That you become the spirit is important.

00:26:21.560 --> 00:26:23.120
You have to become the spirit.

00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:26.160
Now, for example, I'll tell you one small thing here,

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:29.280
how imbalance causes so many troubles to us.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:32.000
There is another center here down below, if you see,

00:26:32.240 --> 00:26:35.400
is called as the center of Swadisthana,

00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:40.000
which gives aortic plexus

00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.840
as the gross manifestation of itself.

00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:47.800
Now when this center goes into imbalance,

00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:51.160
it goes round and round this ocean.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:54.960
Also it can retract. It can go further.

00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:56.480
What happens?

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.400
Now this is a center for our future

00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:02.000
and for our creativity when it comes to the right.

00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.960
And when it moves to the left because it has got a step,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.440
like a lotus it moves.

00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:07.960
And if it comes to the left,

00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:12.360
it acts for something what we call

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:15.960
unauthorized, anti-god activity.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:18.800
So another one is also unauthorized,

00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.840
because when we say that, "I am doing that,"

00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:26.360
then it is ego, is created in you

00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:30.760
and which passes into that pouch there in the head like a balloon

00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:36.440
and you form a big institution of ego in your head.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.080
On the other side is this one,

00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.760
where it comes to the left or any conditioning that takes place,

00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.680
that people say, "Don't do that, and don't do that,"

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.840
and all kinds of conditionings through any kind of teachings,

00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:54.840
that creates another institution is called as superego.

00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:59.920
Now when we go to the extremes of anything,

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:03.040
how problems are caused, example of that

00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:05.840
I will try to give of one center,

00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:09.480
because there is no time for Me to cover all the centers.

00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:12.400
Take this Swadisthana Chakra.

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.560
It has a very important work to do,

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:20.160
is to transform the fat cells of the stomach

00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:23.560
for the use of the cells of the brain.

00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:26.560
Brain also is made of fat cells,

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:29.120
and when a person thinks,

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:33.840
this special Swadisthana Chakra

00:28:34.120 --> 00:28:39.000
converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:41.680
Now, when you think too much for the future,

00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:44.440
you think, think, think. I mean, people are mad with thinking.

00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:45.760
Some of them did tell Me,

00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.440
"Mother, you cut my throat, do what You like, but stop my thinking."

00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:52.600
It has become another inertia sort of thing.

00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:53.720
They just go on thinking.

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:56.680
They just can't stop thinking, whatever they may try.

00:28:56.920 --> 00:29:00.200
So when this process starts of thinking,

00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:03.360
then what happens that this Swadisthana, poor thing,

00:29:03.560 --> 00:29:07.480
goes into a great speedy

00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:10.360
process of transforming the fat cells.

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.080
Now it has some other work to be done.

00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:15.480
Now this is going to the extreme, to think about everything.

00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:18.840
Sitting down they will think that now they have become

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:21.040
the Prime Minister of Australia,

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:23.200
so what should they do to correct.

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:24.960
I mean, there's nothing like an election.

00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:27.400
Nothing has happened, but they are already thinking

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.120
for the Prime Minister.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.520
If they are driving on the street,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:33.400
they are thinking for all the Police Department.

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:36.240
If they are building one house,

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.120
they'll try to find faults with another house

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.560
so that he should not have done,

00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:42.560
while the house they are going to make might collapse.

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.920
But all the time the idea is to see

00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:49.760
and think about everything else that doesn't concern them.

00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:52.240
So this heavy load on your head

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:57.400
makes it a big ego there.

00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:59.960
Apart from that, ego which is a horrid thing,

00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.040
which can make you absolutely stupid,

00:30:02.280 --> 00:30:04.360
but apart from that,

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.960
it makes this poor Swadisthana Chakra work so hard

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:12.120
that you neglect other important things in your body,

00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:17.440
the organs like your liver.

00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.480
Such people have very bad livers,

00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:22.400
those who think all the time, plan all the time.

00:30:22.680 --> 00:30:25.520
They will plan. Even the ladies will plan all the cooking.

00:30:25.720 --> 00:30:27.800
Imagine, ladies planning all the cooking.

00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:31.080
It's absurd! Because you go to the market,

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:34.320
you have planned for the fish and there is no fish in the market,

00:30:34.560 --> 00:30:36.400
and you are upset because you can't cook fish.

00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:37.680
But why did you plan?

00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:39.800
Whatever you get, you bring it home and cook it.

00:30:40.040 --> 00:30:41.160
That's the best way.

00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.400
So this planning business also goes on too far.

00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:47.160
When we go to the extremes it so happens,

00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:53.160
that we make this work too hard and we get a liver trouble.

00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.400
Then we get also the pancreas out of gear,

00:30:57.600 --> 00:31:00.160
because pancreas has to work,

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.120
has to be worked though this Swadisthana Chakra.

00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:06.160
When it is out of gear, the disease you get is diabetes.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.600
The simple thing as diabetes.

00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:12.320
Now in India if you go and see the villagers in India,

00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:14.640
they take at least five spoons of sugar;

00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.680
otherwise, they don't think it's a tea.

00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.600
For tea, they must have five spoons of sugar,

00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:22.640
and they never, never suffer from diabetes.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:27.440
But in the cities, where the people even just touch the sugar,

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:29.280
they get it back in their urine.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.680
So something wrong with the city people.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:33.400
And what is wrong with them is,

00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.480
that they are using this Swadisthana Chakra

00:31:35.680 --> 00:31:39.680
all the time for thinking and thinking and thinking.

00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:42.520
Now another disease that one gets out of it,

00:31:42.760 --> 00:31:47.840
is the disease of the spleen, which is a very serious thing.

00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.640
Spleen produces red blood corpuscles

00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:57.000
according to the necessity of the person.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:03.000
Now, any emergency arises, it starts producing more RBCs.

00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:06.760
Our life is such that we are always in emergencies. Everyone is.

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:10.760
Whether he is a shop keeper or he is a minister,

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.240
everybody seems to be very busy.

00:32:13.440 --> 00:32:16.320
Now, in the morning first of all to read newspapers,

00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:17.640
is another curse.

00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:20.280
Because you read newspapers, you hear, "This is burnt.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:22.200
That is finished. So many died.

00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.000
Somebody in the aeroplane finished off,"

00:32:24.200 --> 00:32:25.920
maybe our relations are there

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.400
- so you get a real pain there in the stomach.

00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:35.320
That's done by this poor spleen. It goes into a big process,

00:32:35.560 --> 00:32:41.040
into a very big mechanical production

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:43.840
of RBC starts.

00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:48.680
Now when that happens to you then you don't know

00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.440
that you better keep the spleen now at least

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:55.240
little rested for other things.

00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.960
But just then you will ask for a breakfast.

00:32:58.200 --> 00:32:59.360
You will get into the car,

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.560
with a breakfast in your hand eating that.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.440
And there is a jam in the way,

00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.240
and then you are screaming at, because you are late.

00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.400
All sorts of things happen to us like that

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:13.600
and we go on creating emergencies for ourselves. For what?

00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.400
What are we going to gain out of it?

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:19.640
With this hurry and scurry what have we achieved?

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:22.400
So this spleen goes out of order.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.200
It does not understand the crazy person.

00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:27.160
It becomes crazy itself.

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:29.760
And it starts producing red blood corpuscles,

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:30.720
this thing, that thing.

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.240
Now you become vulnerable

00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:36.200
to a horrible disease called as leukemia.

00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:38.480
Of course, it is triggered by something else,

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:41.560
about which I may be able to tell you, today or tomorrow.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.080
But you are just vulnerable for a disease

00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:47.600
called leukemia where just doctors will say

00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.400
you may die within one month or two months.

00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.360
That's all they can say about leukemia.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.600
Now such a person doesn't realize that,

00:33:55.800 --> 00:34:00.200
"I have brought this disease upon myself by being like this."

00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.360
We are human beings.

00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:07.320
We cannot rattle like tins.

00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.520
We have to live like human beings.

00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:12.720
The way we rattle ourselves morning till evening

00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.600
is so dangerous for our being

00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:18.120
that we must have a balance in our lives.

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:22.040
We must learn how to rest. And rest is also another problem.

00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:23.640
Then they will go to the sea,

00:34:23.840 --> 00:34:25.920
burn themselves up, completely extreme.

00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.120
I don't know why this fashion has started from where.

00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.680
Must be somebody must have put this into the ideas.

00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:32.000
You see, this is a very recent one.

00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:34.800
About twenty years back nobody bothered about sun-bathing.

00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:36.400
Nobody knew about it.

00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:39.080
When, you see, I just don't understand also

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:42.640
the psychology of the West when they don't like black people

00:34:42.840 --> 00:34:43.920
- they are immigration problem -

00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.840
why do they want to become black themselves?

00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.280
They tan themselves. There are tanning companies,

00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:54.960
this, that, all kinds of things have started

00:34:55.160 --> 00:34:57.920
and that's how they, you know, you get the disease

00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:01.520
called cancer of the skin, which is a very serious disease.

00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:04.440
And this beauty fashion is also for whom?

00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:07.520
I mean, I just don't understand that in India people think that

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.320
you are very good-looking people because you are fair,

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:12.080
and here you think Indians are better

00:35:12.240 --> 00:35:13.840
because they have got darker skins.

00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.240
So whatever we have, we are not satisfied with it.

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:17.640
But it's not so important that

00:35:17.840 --> 00:35:20.960
we should kill ourselves with this sun-tanning to that extreme.

00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.520
So that sort of an extreme

00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:25.920
you do it with this Swadisthana Chakra,

00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.640
and you have problems of this kind.

00:35:29.920 --> 00:35:33.640
But also your tension can rise if you use too much of

00:35:33.920 --> 00:35:35.200
this Swadisthana Chakra because

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.680
your kidneys also become poor things.

00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:40.840
They don't know how to adjust to your madness.

00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:42.160
They way you lead your life,

00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.600
you don't think you are a human being.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.800
You think you are an supersonic aeroplane.

00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:47.760
Then poor kidneys don't know how to work you out.

00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.240
I mean, you are made by God, not by human beings

00:35:50.520 --> 00:35:53.080
who have made super-sonic aeroplanes, this, that.

00:35:53.320 --> 00:35:55.720
And the super-sonic aeroplane doesn't think.

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:59.000
First of all it saves its energy because it doesn't think.

00:35:59.200 --> 00:36:01.000
First of all when you think,

00:36:01.200 --> 00:36:03.040
you are spending most of your energy,

00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:07.200
and actually the way you spend your energy with an extreme way,

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.360
you develop all these horrible diseases.

00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:11.760
Now what happens actually

00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.360
when you start doing too much to the right or to the left?

00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:16.480
Now, the right side is a thing

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.400
where people become extremely fanatic, very disciplined.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.600
All military people, you see, hot-tempered.

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:25.800
You can't just go near them.

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:27.640
If you go near them you will get nothing

00:36:27.840 --> 00:36:29.560
but heat coming out of them.

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.960
They are very hot-tempered people, angry people.

00:36:33.160 --> 00:36:34.160
They lose their temper.

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.600
You just can't talk to them

00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:38.120
because if you say a word, they will box your nose.

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:41.440
This type of people are so many in this world, you can't imagine.

00:36:41.640 --> 00:36:43.200
So many of them are, I have seen.

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:45.600
I am amazed how they exist with themselves.

00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:48.320
Why don't they box themselves sometimes? They might be.

00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:51.240
They are full of anger, frustration and

00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:55.960
all kinds of bad feelings about others and about themselves.

00:36:56.320 --> 00:36:58.480
All these people, all this kind of people,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.080
come up when you become very austere.

00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:03.200
You say, "Oh, I will have no indulgences.

00:37:03.440 --> 00:37:07.960
I am absolutely living on a shoe-string

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.080
and eating just two leaves per day."

00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.280
Such people will thin out and they will look like mosquitoes.

00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.440
But I don't mind their looks,

00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.800
but the way they bite you, is the worst part.

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.360
And they are sometimes regarded as the beauties.

00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:29.640
Then God save us from the beauties,

00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:34.400
because if they become the world beauties [UNCLEAR]

00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:38.480
whatever beauty contest, you see, so, models, this, that,

00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:41.680
then they are lost people, absolutely lost to any senses.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.120
They become really stupid.

00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:46.760
Now this kind of extremity comes to the right side.

00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:51.640
The left side comes when you indulge into something like drugs.

00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:53.800
Now people might say, "What's wrong in drugs?"

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:57.760
It does such a damage to you. It does.

00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:01.000
People may not believe it, but it does.

00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:05.120
It does finish you off on your left side.

00:38:05.360 --> 00:38:08.600
As the alcohol may finish off your liver,

00:38:08.840 --> 00:38:13.040
the left side is completely jammed by the drugs you take,

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:16.360
because you move more towards the left.

00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:17.960
And the more you move,

00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:21.840
you go from your subconscious to the collective subconscious,

00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:25.160
and then you are attacked by negative forces,

00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:27.840
and that's why it attacks your brain also.

00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.800
Such people can just become gradually into

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:33.600
into a state of just like cabbages

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:36.400
and they would not even realize how it is happening.

00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:39.280
So all these things are harmful to us.

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:43.280
Indulgences into anything can make you left-sided.

00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:44.800
Eating too much,

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.400
there is one person eating two leaves, another is eating so much.

00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:51.400
See, all these extreme behaviors, as I said,

00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.200
create a very big problem.

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:55.960
Now how cancer can be caused, we have to see.

00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.080
Then I will move to other things.

00:38:58.280 --> 00:39:01.360
That, supposing this is the center,

00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.760
and this center has got left side and right side.

00:39:05.080 --> 00:39:08.640
At every emergency, both the sympathetic nervous systems

00:39:08.840 --> 00:39:12.320
which are expressed by these two Nadis

00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:16.640
go into action, and when too much action starts,

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:20.600
what happens, the relationship is broken.

00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:24.960
And the deities, who are controlling these, go off to sleep.

00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:28.840
And when the relationship with the whole is broken,

00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:32.440
when it is broken, then

00:39:32.680 --> 00:39:36.800
you have no control from the main,

00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:39.200
you can say, from the whole,

00:39:39.400 --> 00:39:42.160
and the cells become on their own.

00:39:42.360 --> 00:39:45.720
When they become on their own, so individualistic,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:48.240
they become malignant.

00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:50.600
For example, if it happens in the stomach,

00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:53.760
you will find the liver will become so big.

00:39:54.040 --> 00:39:56.240
Or if it happened in the mouth or nose,

00:39:56.480 --> 00:39:59.440
the nose will become so big. The rest of has no chance.

00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:01.200
It's a very ego-oriented stuff.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.840
It goes increasing, increasing.

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.600
And also if you live with an ego-oriented man,

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:08.160
you can become also ego-oriented.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:11.080
Hitler is one of the examples of that,

00:40:11.320 --> 00:40:14.320
how he made people ego-oriented and so stupid.

00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:20.240
Actually so horrible by his own great ego that he developed.

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.960
So these cells also become like that

00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:25.560
and they make other cells also malignant

00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.040
and that's how the cancer is settled.

00:40:28.280 --> 00:40:30.720
Now to such a patient, what have we to do?

00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.480
You have to try to raise his Kundalini.

00:40:33.680 --> 00:40:39.160
By giving some power there at that point, you can pacify.

00:40:39.520 --> 00:40:42.080
You can give some additional, as you call the petrol,

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:43.800
to the exhausted one.

00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.040
And gradually when it is done,

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:48.360
it comes back to its normal  [UNCLEAR:could be - 'ways' OR 'phase'].

00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.800
Then you put the Kundalini through it.

00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:54.640
So it makes an ascent and keeps it in place.

00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:58.200
It awakens the deity in that center

00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:01.760
and that center looks after the gross side of life.

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.320
That is how cancer can be cured.

00:41:04.560 --> 00:41:07.440
It's true that Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.480
of so many people and some people in

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:11.440
ten minutes have got rid of their cancer.

00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:13.760
Ten minutes, is a fact.

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.640
But that doesn't mean that I am going to cure everybody's cancer,

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:20.000
by any chance. It is not so.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:21.840
You see, the trouble with people is,

00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:25.840
they say, "Do you claim you can cure cancer?"

00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:29.600
I say, "I don't claim. But Sahaja Yoga can do it."

00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.680
"Then you must cure this cancer."

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:35.120
I said, "Why? Why should I cure?

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:37.520
Are you paying Me something?

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:38.720
Have you called Me here?

00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.240
I have come My own.

00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:43.120
If I want I will; otherwise, I will not."

00:41:43.360 --> 00:41:47.200
You see, it is like a aggression of this kind on a person that,

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:48.920
"You must show how you can cure."

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:52.040
Why should I show? I don't want to show it.

00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:55.640
Like I had a very big lecture in the medical college,

00:41:55.920 --> 00:41:57.400
medical institute in India,

00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.960
and of course the Vice Chancellor was very much impressed.

00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.160
But some of the doctors they came and they said,

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:04.680
"Mother, we will give you four patients of cancer

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:05.800
and you cure them."

00:42:06.040 --> 00:42:09.600
I said, "I have no time. I am very busy.

00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:11.640
You better ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.400
get their realization and cure themselves.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:15.160
I have no time for that. I am sorry.

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.840
I am busy with other work."

00:42:17.120 --> 00:42:18.800
So, then they said, "All right.

00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:21.400
Do you have any file of the patients you've cured?"

00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:25.280
I said, "I have none. I have no time for filing."

00:42:25.560 --> 00:42:26.800
It just flows. It just works.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.640
What am I to write down everywhere?

00:42:28.920 --> 00:42:31.560
This is it. I have cured this x, y, z, for what?

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.840
I have no clientele. I do not have to cash it.

00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:36.440
So why should I do it?

00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:38.440
It's just flowing. Those who want to have it,

00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:40.640
can have it and can work it out.

00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:42.240
But you cannot force Me

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.080
that,  "You must write down and …", for what?

00:42:45.320 --> 00:42:46.960
What is the purpose?

00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:48.960
I am not running a hospital.

00:42:49.160 --> 00:42:53.240
I don't have to have a credibility on that, if I cure or not.

00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:56.200
For that doctors have to get their realization first.

00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:58.840
If they don't get their realization, I am not bothered.

00:42:59.080 --> 00:43:00.800
If they are really bothered about cancer,

00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.120
or any other disease, why don't they take their realization

00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:06.160
and help their patients? They can.

00:43:06.360 --> 00:43:08.520
But the patients who are not interested in God,

00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:10.920
God is also not interested in those patients.

00:43:11.160 --> 00:43:14.000
It's common sense. God has the greatest common sense.

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:16.760
The lights which are never going to work out,

00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.320
which are absolutely useless,

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.840
you are not going to repair them, will you?

00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:22.800
No human being is going to do that.

00:43:23.040 --> 00:43:24.200
What's the use of repairing a light

00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:25.640
which is never going to work out?

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:27.840
So God is also like that.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.600
He has such a lot of common sense.

00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:31.760
He is not going to waste His energy for these things.

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:36.360
The most important thing today is not to cure people

00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.480
but to give them realization;

00:43:38.680 --> 00:43:43.560
to redeem them, to evolve them, is the main part.

00:43:43.840 --> 00:43:47.080
You can be counseled, you can be told, everything explained,

00:43:47.280 --> 00:43:49.280
you can be brought to logically conclusion.

00:43:49.520 --> 00:43:52.360
But the aim is to get your realization

00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.680
and not to worry about your illness.

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.720
Illness will disappear gradually.

00:43:57.000 --> 00:43:58.600
It has happened with so many people

00:43:58.840 --> 00:44:00.080
and it should happen with you.

00:44:00.280 --> 00:44:01.560
But it should not be a condition,

00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:04.280
that you come to Sahaja Yoga as an obligation on us

00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:06.680
that,  "We have come to Sahaja Yoga, you better now."

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:10.800
That's not so, because, as you know, we have no organization.

00:44:11.080 --> 00:44:12.680
There is no organization that we have.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:15.840
You have to come humbly to it, and it works out.

00:44:16.120 --> 00:44:19.600
God is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love.

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.560
He is the one who is so anxious

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.720
that you all should enter into His kingdom

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.600
to occupy your great seats as His children.

00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:29.200
He is the Father of the Fathers.

00:44:29.400 --> 00:44:32.280
He is the most loving Father you could think of.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.840
Then when we challenge Him like this, He doesn't like it.

00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.080
We have to enter into His kingdom in a humble way,

00:44:40.280 --> 00:44:43.320
and He will definitely bestow His blessings on all of you,

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.480
because He is the one who is so anxious.

00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:49.120
I Myself amazed at the way He is blessing people.

00:44:49.360 --> 00:44:52.600
Imagine six thousand people before Me, they just get realization.

00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.600
Can you imagine such a thing happening?

00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.400
I have seen Myself. It's happening.

00:44:56.600 --> 00:44:58.840
So many things are happening today

00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.720
that is evident that God is very gracious,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:04.400
as well as He is wrathful.

00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:06.520
He is a wrathful God for people

00:45:06.720 --> 00:45:09.520
who do not take to Him.

00:45:09.720 --> 00:45:12.640
He is wrathful. And that's why one has to be careful.

00:45:12.840 --> 00:45:15.600
If you lead a life on your own - "What's wrong?"

00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.640
"What's wrong" is one of the philosophies people have

00:45:19.960 --> 00:45:24.080
- then you have to pay for it, this way or that way.

00:45:24.320 --> 00:45:27.600
So as a Mother I have to tell you that, "Why not?"

00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.400
When you have got everything.

00:45:29.720 --> 00:45:31.640
You have got the spirit within you.

00:45:31.840 --> 00:45:33.400
Is the power is within you.

00:45:33.680 --> 00:45:36.320
Everything is there. Why not get your realization?

00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:40.360
Why succumb to this useless ego which is not yourself?

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:43.840
You are not your ego. You are your self.

00:45:44.120 --> 00:45:45.960
You are your spirit.

00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:48.640
And that spirit, when it comes to your attention,

00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:50.720
you become such a wonderful person.

00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:52.600
The whole thing is lost.

00:45:52.840 --> 00:45:56.520
Like a lotus rising out of the mud,

00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.560
it covers the whole of that pond

00:45:59.800 --> 00:46:02.960
and its fragrance fills the atmosphere with such beauty.

00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:05.200
That's what happens to you when you get it.

00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:06.640
So why not have that?

00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:08.960
This is your own, within your self,

00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:10.760
and the Divine is so anxious.

00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:13.280
I don't know what is the missing point.

00:46:13.520 --> 00:46:15.840
Today, I am sorry they have today called Me

00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:18.520
after this program for a radio, and I am going there.

00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:21.360
I don't know how many people are going to attack Me on the phone.

00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:23.400
You see, all kinds of things they say on the phone.

00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:25.440
But I told them I will not receive the phone.

00:46:25.640 --> 00:46:27.120
You better receive the phone and let Me know.

00:46:27.320 --> 00:46:29.120
Because all these things are subject to,

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.480
I find that people use it for just call sometimes,

00:46:33.680 --> 00:46:35.440
for not expressing anything good

00:46:35.680 --> 00:46:37.920
but for expressing something that's

00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:42.440
inside them anti-God, absolutely anti-God thing.

00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:44.560
I hope today they will behave themselves

00:46:44.800 --> 00:46:47.800
and it will be a good time for them

00:46:48.080 --> 00:46:50.160
that they should enjoy the bliss of God.

00:46:50.360 --> 00:46:53.600
I must thank for people who rang Me up to say

00:46:53.800 --> 00:46:58.360
that they received their vibrations on the television.

00:46:58.600 --> 00:47:00.120
And that they telephoned to Me

00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:01.800
and they found out My phone number,

00:47:02.040 --> 00:47:04.440
because My phone number was not available.

00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:06.920
And it should happen to all of you today,

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:08.400
that you should get your realization.

00:47:08.600 --> 00:47:11.320
So the first intense feeling should be

00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:15.000
that we should get our realization, somehow we get it,

00:47:15.200 --> 00:47:18.240
and then we will talk about the rest of the things.

00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:22.560
Yesterday I gave a lot of time for questions.

00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:28.440
And today I think we have very little time.

00:47:28.640 --> 00:47:31.160
But still I can allow you to ask two-three questions

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:35.600
and then we should go ahead with the procedure of realization.

00:47:35.840 --> 00:47:38.160
But too many questions are not needed.

00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:40.040
What you need is your realization.

00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:41.800
Actually, if you ask too many questions,

00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:43.640
sometimes the realization doesn't work out.

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:45.680
Not to frighten you but I tell you,

00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:47.240
because your mind starts working.

00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:49.720
You have to, you see, take it beyond your mind.

00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:53.240
Tomorrow I'll tell you about that great chakra of Agnya,

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:56.080
which is bestowed upon the deity of Jesus Christ.

00:47:56.320 --> 00:47:58.600
That how, when the Kundalini rises through it,

00:47:58.800 --> 00:48:03.320
how He sucks in these two horrible things called ego and superego,

00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:07.320
and how you become thoughtlessly aware and you come in the present.

00:48:07.560 --> 00:48:11.960
And you become, when it comes out of your fontanel bone area,

00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:15.360
the real baptism takes place and you get connected.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:17.720
You get connected with the whole

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:20.400
and you become collectively conscious. You become.

00:48:20.600 --> 00:48:21.800
Again I say, it is actualization.

00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.520
It is not just talking that, "We are all brothers and sisters,"

00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.600
but you just become it, comes in your awareness.

00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:32.400
And you start feeling the other person on your fingertips,

00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:34.320
yourself, on your fingertips.

00:48:34.560 --> 00:48:35.800
As Mohammed has said,

00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.520
"At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak."

00:48:39.720 --> 00:48:42.840
He has spoken more about this time than about the doomsday.

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:45.200
But all the Muslims are talking about the doomsday only.

00:48:45.400 --> 00:48:47.960
I don't know why they are waiting for that before this.

00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:49.920
So first the resurrection time has to come

00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:53.600
because in all graciousness and kindness and compassion of God,

00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:56.640
He is going to give us a full chance to achieve ourselves,

00:48:56.920 --> 00:48:58.200
because this is His creation.

00:48:58.520 --> 00:49:00.840
He is anxious to do it.

00:49:01.160 --> 00:49:03.600
He doesn't want His creation to be destroyed.

00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:06.840
So, may God bless you.
