00:01.440 --> 00:05.840
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:08.440 --> 00:13.440
May God give you wisdom and understanding

00:14.000 --> 00:19.840
about the truth and about Himself.

00:22.840 --> 00:27.400
Doctor Warren just now brought out a point

00:27.720 --> 00:33.600
that if somebody is doing this work

00:34.200 --> 00:38.360
in a split of a second, even

00:38.600 --> 00:43.240
on the television when it was only one minute, if it works out,

00:43.600 --> 00:47.600
then there has to be somebody special.

00:47.960 --> 00:52.040
All this kind of talk

00:52.240 --> 00:55.120
is not necessary in India,

00:55.320 --> 00:59.360
because Indians are well educated in spiritual matters.

00:59.680 --> 01:04.360
They know what is the Shakti is, what is Kundalini is.

01:04.640 --> 01:06.280
They know the chakras.

01:06.480 --> 01:08.320
They are very well equipped.

01:08.640 --> 01:13.720
They have got the names of the Shakti in which it is said so.

01:14.040 --> 01:19.560
So to them it is not to be told and requested.

01:19.840 --> 01:23.520
But in the West, though such great saints have been born,

01:23.720 --> 01:25.400
such seekers are born,

01:25.600 --> 01:28.160
they have forgotten the knowledge that they had,

01:28.360 --> 01:33.320
perhaps, of the power of God.

01:33.520 --> 01:37.240
And that's why I find the sensitivity of people

01:37.560 --> 01:40.000
is not towards understanding the reality,

01:40.240 --> 01:43.480
but more they take to artificial things.

01:43.800 --> 01:46.720
Perhaps the more we are in contact with machine,

01:47.000 --> 01:51.080
we become more akin

01:51.280 --> 01:54.640
or close to machine.

01:54.840 --> 01:59.840
We try to understand everything in a machine-like manner,

02:00.080 --> 02:05.560
but not in that sensitive way, that people had once upon a time.

02:05.920 --> 02:08.200
Even at the time of Christ,

02:08.400 --> 02:13.160
except for few Jews who didn't like Him

02:13.440 --> 02:18.560
because they wanted to have their own money-making propositions,

02:18.920 --> 02:21.640
they crucified Him.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.480
Even the judge who judged Him,

02:24.760 --> 02:29.800
his wife could understand that He was a saint.

02:30.120 --> 02:33.080
And the people around Him,

02:33.360 --> 02:35.120
who were simple people,

02:35.360 --> 02:40.440
all of them knew that He was something saintly.

02:40.800 --> 02:44.440
Even at the time of Shri Krishna and Shri Rama, it has happened.

02:44.680 --> 02:50.160
I agree that many saints have been crucified, have been tortured,

02:50.560 --> 02:54.680
but not by the general public, by general people.

02:54.960 --> 02:57.640
It has been done by people who were in power,

02:57.920 --> 03:00.480
or who were prophesying some sort of a religion,

03:00.800 --> 03:03.080
who thought that their religion is in danger

03:03.240 --> 03:05.920
because they were making money out of that religion.

03:06.160 --> 03:09.280
These are the people who did all these atrocities

03:09.560 --> 03:13.560
and they brought forth this kind of calamity

03:13.760 --> 03:17.120
or this kind of torture to the great saints who lived.

03:18.000 --> 03:20.280
But today is just the other way round.

03:20.520 --> 03:22.320
The public is not sensitive enough.

03:22.520 --> 03:27.520
That's a very hard thing to feel that the public itself

03:27.840 --> 03:33.080
is not understanding what is the truth and how to come to the truth.

03:33.400 --> 03:36.200
Yesterday in short I told you,

03:36.440 --> 03:38.600
first of all we have to be honest people

03:38.800 --> 03:41.320
if you want to find the truth.

03:41.680 --> 03:45.280
Is a simple proposition that we have to be honest about it,

03:45.520 --> 03:49.000
that we should know that we cannot purchase the truth.

03:49.360 --> 03:52.240
Secondly, the truth is what it is.

03:52.520 --> 03:56.200
Whatever are your own conceptions about truth is not the truth.

03:56.400 --> 03:58.760
Is your own idea, your mental projection.

03:59.040 --> 04:03.400
Truth is what it is. It will be for ever and ever.

04:03.640 --> 04:06.040
And truth cannot compromise for you.

04:06.280 --> 04:09.240
You have to compromise for the truth.

04:09.520 --> 04:11.520
It is the other way round thing,

04:12.040 --> 04:14.400
that you have to compromise for the truth.

04:14.640 --> 04:18.840
You have to understand that so far those concepts you had,

04:19.120 --> 04:21.320
relatively if they are not near the truth,

04:21.520 --> 04:23.040
then you have to give them out.

04:23.280 --> 04:24.760
It's a very strange thing

04:25.000 --> 04:28.760
that you great people who are seekers,

04:29.000 --> 04:31.400
are born in various countries,

04:31.640 --> 04:33.720
in so many countries, I find.

04:34.040 --> 04:38.440
And then at this juncture,

04:38.760 --> 04:41.920
when it is not because there is so much sickness and all that.

04:42.120 --> 04:44.040
But is a special time also.

04:44.240 --> 04:46.160
Is a time of resurrection.

04:46.360 --> 04:48.840
Is the time of your last judgment.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.440
At this great times,

04:51.640 --> 04:57.280
that people should lose their sensitivity to reality.

04:57.680 --> 05:02.520
It is amazing how people take to artificial things.

05:02.720 --> 05:06.160
So many things people have done just because

05:06.360 --> 05:07.800
they could not see through.

05:08.040 --> 05:09.640
That's why I requested you yesterday,

05:09.840 --> 05:12.680
you must come to some logical conclusion.

05:12.920 --> 05:15.240
You must use your brains and understand

05:15.480 --> 05:17.480
that reality, if it lies within you

05:17.720 --> 05:22.960
and if it is a living process of your evolution,

05:23.160 --> 05:25.600
then it has to be done

05:25.840 --> 05:30.680
in a way that is not done by human beings,

05:31.040 --> 05:35.560
because no living work is done by human beings. It cannot be done.

05:35.840 --> 05:38.640
We cannot transform one flower into a fruit,

05:38.920 --> 05:43.080
leave alone a human being into a spirit.

05:43.280 --> 05:47.840
So, it has to be done by the same process

05:48.080 --> 05:50.160
which has made us human beings,

05:50.360 --> 05:55.760
and the same process that is living force of God's love,

05:56.040 --> 05:59.960
of living God's love, should do the job.

06:00.200 --> 06:02.680
So it has to be spontaneous.

06:03.000 --> 06:06.120
You cannot achieve it through your efforts.

06:06.320 --> 06:08.280
Actually, those who tell you like that,

06:08.480 --> 06:10.200
that "You have to achieve it through your efforts,"

06:10.360 --> 06:11.360
or, "You have got your karmas.

06:11.560 --> 06:12.920
You have got to suffer," and all that,

06:13.120 --> 06:14.800
are just giving excuses.

06:15.040 --> 06:16.440
They don't know how to achieve it.

06:16.680 --> 06:18.120
They are just giving excuses.

06:18.320 --> 06:22.120
You must understand that if you have got that power within you,

06:22.320 --> 06:24.640
it has to manifest spontaneously.

06:24.920 --> 06:30.040
For example, some people may not get realization.

06:30.400 --> 06:34.440
May be little bit, very little bit percentage, I hope,

06:34.680 --> 06:35.560
may not get it.

06:35.800 --> 06:37.640
But that is nothing wrong with Sahaja Yoga.

06:37.840 --> 06:39.600
There must be something wrong within you,

06:39.800 --> 06:42.480
physically, mentally, emotionally.

06:42.760 --> 06:44.240
There must be something wrong.

06:44.480 --> 06:45.800
So we have to correct it

06:46.080 --> 06:50.400
and we have to see that you get your realization

06:50.640 --> 06:55.640
in a proper way and that it is achieved

06:56.080 --> 07:00.760
through your own understanding, in your own glory.

07:01.040 --> 07:04.360
That you should know that you have got your realization.

07:04.600 --> 07:06.000
This is the only difference

07:06.200 --> 07:10.240
between the evolutionary process so far from animal to this stage,

07:10.480 --> 07:14.520
that human beings will be aware of their realization.

07:15.120 --> 07:16.440
They will know all about it

07:16.720 --> 07:20.440
because now they have become masters,

07:20.720 --> 07:23.560
that they are not doing things automatically.

07:23.840 --> 07:26.960
They will know that this power is flowing through them

07:27.200 --> 07:29.520
and they will also know how to handle it,

07:29.800 --> 07:32.080
which can be decode through Sahaja Yoga.

07:32.320 --> 07:37.600
And you have to learn the technique of operating God's laws,

07:37.840 --> 07:42.280
which are tremendous and wonderful.

07:42.600 --> 07:46.120
You believe it or not: God exists.

07:46.360 --> 07:50.040
His loving power is all-pervading.

07:50.320 --> 07:51.720
We have never felt it before.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.400
I agree there, you have never felt that

07:54.600 --> 07:57.040
His all-pervading power is everywhere.

07:57.280 --> 07:59.080
You have felt the ether,

07:59.280 --> 08:03.320
through which we receive the television and other communications,

08:03.560 --> 08:06.160
but you have not felt that subtle power,

08:06.360 --> 08:08.600
which is all-pervading, not only but that,

08:08.840 --> 08:12.520
but is the subtle of all these gross that you see.

08:12.840 --> 08:15.160
But the time has come,

08:15.400 --> 08:18.680
very precious time, that you have to get it.

08:18.960 --> 08:21.120
So all your other identifications,

08:21.320 --> 08:23.280
I am sorry, you have to drop them.

08:23.480 --> 08:24.920
You have to just become yourself.

08:25.120 --> 08:26.680
Whatever you have gathered in life time,

08:26.920 --> 08:31.280
all kinds of concepts, and precepts and all that, forget it.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.840
Just think that you are a human being

08:34.080 --> 08:35.800
and you have to get your realization.

08:36.040 --> 08:37.640
That's the most important thing.

08:37.840 --> 08:40.680
All the rest of things are of no use.

08:40.920 --> 08:43.560
So I would request you first of all,

08:43.800 --> 08:48.000
in all honesty, try to be the spirit.

08:48.200 --> 08:49.720
And if you become the spirit,

08:49.960 --> 08:55.800
try to understand the path of progress in your spiritual ascent.

08:56.520 --> 09:01.040
Now to come to the point of this

09:01.360 --> 09:05.440
subtle instrument already created within us,

09:05.720 --> 09:09.040
to come to this point we have to understand,

09:09.240 --> 09:14.080
as I told you yesterday that this is the knowledge of the roots.

09:14.320 --> 09:15.960
Whatever you have so far,

09:16.160 --> 09:18.400
is the knowledge of the tree.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.320
But you don't have any knowledge of the roots.

09:22.560 --> 09:24.040
Many people have told me,

09:24.240 --> 09:26.160
"Mother, what Christianity has failed.

09:26.360 --> 09:29.360
That religion has failed. This religion has failed.

09:29.560 --> 09:31.840
How can it be? If there is God, how can it be?"

09:32.120 --> 09:33.360
I mean, there are communists also in this world

09:33.560 --> 09:35.720
who deny God completely.

09:36.000 --> 09:40.400
But is not that the religions have failed;

09:40.640 --> 09:42.480
not the prophets have failed;

09:42.720 --> 09:44.400
not the incarnations have failed.

09:44.600 --> 09:46.400
It's the people who represented them,

09:46.640 --> 09:49.160
wanted to make something of their own,

09:49.320 --> 09:51.160
of their own concept, of their ideas,

09:51.360 --> 09:54.560
and the whole thing has become such a market place,

09:54.840 --> 09:57.240
that I just don't understand.

09:57.440 --> 09:58.840
How can you sell God?

09:59.120 --> 10:00.960
How can you sell His ideas?

10:01.160 --> 10:04.840
There is no business about God.

10:05.080 --> 10:09.840
Now this one is the great instrument that you have within yourself.

10:10.120 --> 10:13.240
Yesterday I told you that you need not accept Me

10:13.480 --> 10:18.360
as a sort of a conditioning on your mind.

10:18.640 --> 10:22.640
But as a scientist, keep an open mind.

10:22.840 --> 10:25.720
And this is the hypothesis I put before you,

10:26.000 --> 10:27.680
and when it works out,

10:27.920 --> 10:30.840
you have to see if it is all right or not.

10:31.120 --> 10:35.640
Now some of you who might be doubting about it,

10:35.840 --> 10:39.480
or thinking that, "Oh, it's all another story," or things like that.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.160
They can go ahead with it

10:41.400 --> 10:44.240
because Divine is not interested in such people.

10:44.520 --> 10:46.520
Divine is only interested in people

10:46.760 --> 10:50.240
who are honestly seeking the truth.

10:50.640 --> 10:54.600
So this center that you see the first of all,

10:54.800 --> 10:57.400
is a very important center.

10:57.640 --> 10:59.720
I don't know what he has told you about it,

10:59.960 --> 11:02.400
but is called as the Mooladhara.

11:02.600 --> 11:06.120
It's the center of Mooladhara,

11:06.320 --> 11:08.800
center of Mooladhara.

11:09.080 --> 11:12.600
Mooladhara itself is that triangular bone,

11:12.840 --> 11:16.200
which is a very small triangle. You cannot see it clearly.

11:16.400 --> 11:19.080
We should have expanded it to show you,

11:19.360 --> 11:22.640
which contains in itself

11:22.960 --> 11:26.160
the power of Kundalini.

11:26.400 --> 11:30.840
Is the power of that energy, which I told you yesterday,

11:31.080 --> 11:35.160
is the pure desire to become one with God.

11:35.440 --> 11:39.480
All other desires are not satiable.

11:39.760 --> 11:43.400
That's why this is the only desire that has to manifest.

11:43.600 --> 11:47.400
Otherwise, you are not going to be satisfied with your life.

11:47.640 --> 11:53.520
Now, this pure desire exists in that triangular bone,

11:54.120 --> 11:59.360
and you could see it also when you raise the Kundalini,

11:59.640 --> 12:02.960
is pulsating there just like a heart.

12:03.200 --> 12:07.000
But not on every person. Not on every seeker.

12:07.200 --> 12:11.160
Only those who have a problem with the other two centers,

12:11.400 --> 12:16.840
you can see with your naked eye, the pulsation of the Kundalini.

12:17.080 --> 12:20.160
When there is such a pulsation of the Kundalini,

12:20.360 --> 12:22.840
we have to know that these two centers

12:23.080 --> 12:25.760
are in problem in human beings.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.240
And these two centers are,

12:29.240 --> 12:33.000
the higher one is called as the Nabhi Chakra,

12:33.200 --> 12:37.120
which means the center, the subtler center of the navel.

12:37.320 --> 12:40.280
And this center manifests outside,

12:40.480 --> 12:45.240
what we call the solar plexus.

12:45.440 --> 12:48.160
In the medical terminology is called as solar plexus.

12:48.400 --> 12:49.960
But that's the gross thing.

12:50.160 --> 12:51.480
This is the subtle center

12:51.680 --> 12:55.000
which is in the medulla oblongata in the spinal cord.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.600
Now this is a very, very important center within us again,

12:58.800 --> 13:03.000
which was created since long, when we were seeking.

13:03.200 --> 13:06.080
First, as animals we were seeking food.

13:06.360 --> 13:08.640
Then also we were seeking our evolution.

13:08.840 --> 13:11.960
Because animals also sought

13:12.160 --> 13:15.320
their ascent

13:15.600 --> 13:18.280
from a one-unicellular animal

13:18.480 --> 13:20.720
to a multi-cellular animal,

13:21.000 --> 13:24.000
like all the quadrupeds are or the mammals are.

13:24.240 --> 13:28.600
How they arrived it, is no one can say.

13:28.840 --> 13:31.160
because the power that worked for it,

13:31.360 --> 13:35.480
lies in the central path of this central Nadi

13:35.680 --> 13:39.840
called as Sushumna Nadi.

13:41.360 --> 13:45.560
So first we were seeking the food.

13:45.840 --> 13:50.360
Then we were seeking the shelter, as you go by in the history.

13:50.640 --> 13:53.000
Then as we evolved more and more,

13:53.200 --> 13:58.400
we started seeking our joy in, say, economics,

13:58.600 --> 14:03.440
in possessions, then in politics, in power.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.040
Then we evolved much more

14:06.280 --> 14:08.480
and we thought there is no joy in all these things.

14:08.680 --> 14:09.760
We have had enough of it.

14:10.000 --> 14:11.840
Specially the affluence helped you a lot.

14:12.080 --> 14:14.800
Because affluent people get fed-up of materialism,

14:15.040 --> 14:17.320
and the plastic mountains that they have created.

14:17.560 --> 14:20.840
And they just want to have something simple in life.

14:21.200 --> 14:26.600
At this stage then they start thinking of their spirit.

14:26.960 --> 14:29.800
They think, "How is it that we are not yet satisfied?

14:30.080 --> 14:33.120
How is it we are so restless? What are we seeking?"

14:33.400 --> 14:35.440
Some of them know what they are seeking.

14:35.680 --> 14:37.800
Some of them don't know what they are seeking,

14:38.040 --> 14:39.800
but even if they know what they are seeking,

14:40.040 --> 14:43.760
they don't know how it will happen, and what should we expect.

14:44.080 --> 14:45.520
That's a very important thing

14:45.760 --> 14:49.440
where I find Indian people are better equipped.

14:49.640 --> 14:51.640
But you have another great equipment,

14:51.920 --> 14:55.400
that your desire to seek is very strong,

14:55.600 --> 14:59.680
is extremely strong, and you go like a bull at it.

14:59.960 --> 15:03.040
I have seen people who got realization,

15:03.280 --> 15:06.520
and they were running so fast towards it

15:06.720 --> 15:08.640
that even after getting realization

15:08.840 --> 15:11.040
they would not accept that they have sought it.

15:11.240 --> 15:13.760
They would not stop, you see. Like a bull is running very fast,

15:13.960 --> 15:16.160
you see, even if you offer him something to eat

15:16.360 --> 15:17.800
he won't be able to stop at that point.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.720
He goes little ahead then he looks back, "Yes, that's it."

15:21.000 --> 15:22.000
So he comes back.

15:22.200 --> 15:24.200
It has happened with so many people

15:24.400 --> 15:27.720
who have done a kind of a guru-shopping,

15:27.960 --> 15:30.720
I would call it, it's a habit.

15:31.000 --> 15:33.800
They take a bag in the hand with little money,

15:34.040 --> 15:36.400
go round in the shop, "Now which guru is available?"

15:36.600 --> 15:40.400
So they go to one guru, "All right, no good, hopeless."

15:40.600 --> 15:43.600
Then he goes to another guru, third one.

15:43.840 --> 15:49.400
And Sahaja Yoga is a temple somewhere away from that market.

15:49.640 --> 15:53.640
So that habit is also formed in human beings of seeking

15:53.840 --> 15:59.400
that even being introduced to Sahaja Yoga

15:59.600 --> 16:01.840
and even after becoming the spirit

16:02.120 --> 16:03.840
feeling the all-pervading power,

16:04.120 --> 16:08.320
still they don't want to stop, because the inertia is too much.

16:08.520 --> 16:10.440
And it's still they are going on.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.600
But after some time, they reverse back.

16:12.800 --> 16:16.240
I've seen many things like that happening in Sahaja Yoga

16:16.480 --> 16:18.120
in every place I went to.

16:18.320 --> 16:20.360
Specially in England is very common

16:20.560 --> 16:23.280
that in first shot they just can't believe it,

16:23.480 --> 16:25.000
"How can it be? It's not so simple."

16:25.200 --> 16:27.320
Because then their ego is finished.

16:27.600 --> 16:30.200
They have found it, "How can it be? We can't do it by ourselves."

16:30.400 --> 16:33.280
So they forget about Sahaja Yoga for a while.

16:33.520 --> 16:36.480
Then the Kundalini comes and tickles them all over.

16:36.680 --> 16:38.640
Again She comes and clears them all over.

16:38.840 --> 16:40.800
Then they start thinking, "What's happening to me?"

16:41.040 --> 16:44.800
And then they come back to Me and say,  "Mother,

16:45.040 --> 16:46.720
I must say there was something that had happened.

16:46.960 --> 16:49.520
But I, just I was too fast. I was too speedy

16:49.760 --> 16:51.640
and I just didn't get the glimpse of it."

16:51.840 --> 16:53.640
All right, settle down now.

16:54.000 --> 16:56.840
So that's one thing is always common and it's all right.

16:57.120 --> 16:59.320
It's excusable; this doesn't matter.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.560
You take your own time. I am not in a hurry.

17:01.840 --> 17:04.480
But Divine is. Divine is in a very great hurry,

17:04.720 --> 17:08.160
and the work has to be done in a very great speed now.

17:08.400 --> 17:10.400
It is very important that we have to move

17:10.640 --> 17:13.000
in a very tremendous speed.

17:13.400 --> 17:18.040
So this seeking within us

17:18.240 --> 17:24.080
is surrounded by this ocean of illusion, within ourselves.

17:24.480 --> 17:30.040
This ocean of illusion comes to us because of our ignorance.

17:30.440 --> 17:34.040
We see things which do not exist.

17:34.320 --> 17:37.800
For example, there is a gentleman who comes to us.

17:38.040 --> 17:40.080
He is very sweet to talk to.

17:40.440 --> 17:44.280
And after sometime we find that we are missing our purse.

17:44.560 --> 17:48.280
It's gone. He was very nice, very well-dressed.

17:48.480 --> 17:49.600
Then how is it he's vanished?

17:49.840 --> 17:53.000
Most of the bank robbers are very well-dressed people.

17:53.200 --> 17:58.040
And the way they do it, it's surprising, how they befool.

17:58.280 --> 18:01.440
Very intelligent people also, by their dress,

18:01.640 --> 18:05.000
by their methods, and the way they perfect themselves.

18:05.200 --> 18:11.080
So what happens that you cannot make out reality,

18:11.280 --> 18:15.440
and this illusion is in everything we have,

18:15.800 --> 18:19.280
and in that illusion, all the time we are lost.

18:19.560 --> 18:23.120
We feel that, "This is the house I have made.

18:23.320 --> 18:26.080
What a nice thing I have done. Such a great thing!"

18:26.320 --> 18:27.560
But if you look at it,

18:27.760 --> 18:31.120
after all, this is all dead from to the dead.

18:31.400 --> 18:34.480
You make a chair; then you think, "Oh, I've made a big chair."

18:34.720 --> 18:36.600
Now this chair is all right,

18:36.840 --> 18:38.800
but tomorrow you won't be able to seat on the ground,

18:39.040 --> 18:40.680
if you are sitting on the chair.

18:40.960 --> 18:44.360
So like many illusions we have about things,

18:44.600 --> 18:48.840
material things also. Say now, if I have, say, a beautiful carpet,

18:49.160 --> 18:51.960
like this one. It's not mine, thank God.

18:52.160 --> 18:54.280
But supposing it, I possessed it,

18:54.520 --> 18:57.680
then I have to go to insurance company.

18:58.000 --> 18:59.360
I have to look after it.

18:59.560 --> 19:02.640
I should bother now, "Have you given it back to me or not?"

19:02.960 --> 19:05.320
But if it is somebody else's, I am enjoying it

19:05.520 --> 19:08.720
very well and without worrying about it.

19:09.040 --> 19:11.320
But the idea of possessions also come in.

19:11.560 --> 19:16.200
Then there is an idea of relationships also.

19:16.440 --> 19:18.560
All these are such great illusions.

19:18.800 --> 19:21.960
They just open out, absolutely open out,

19:22.160 --> 19:26.480
as soon as you find the light of spirit in your attention.

19:26.720 --> 19:30.280
Like in this room when you enter in, you find it's dark.

19:30.600 --> 19:33.000
You catch hold of a chair. You will say, "The chair is the room."

19:33.200 --> 19:36.320
Somebody will say, "This pillar is the room."

19:36.600 --> 19:38.680
Somebody will say something else.

19:38.960 --> 19:43.160
But supposing you just push a button, the light comes in.

19:43.360 --> 19:45.280
Then you understand what is this room,

19:45.520 --> 19:47.520
what is the relationship with each other.

19:47.720 --> 19:51.360
The whole integrated knowledge

19:51.560 --> 19:53.840
about this room comes to you, when there is light.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.840
And this is what one should understand out of enlightenment.

19:58.080 --> 20:00.240
But the illusion is, people think,

20:00.400 --> 20:03.440
that when they are deluded, they are rising.

20:03.680 --> 20:05.960
The other day somebody asked Me a very funny question

20:06.160 --> 20:10.840
that, "Is schizophrenia, is it a step to enlightenment?"

20:11.080 --> 20:12.560
Now can you imagine?

20:12.760 --> 20:15.280
But then I heard that there is a very big book written

20:15.480 --> 20:17.200
about this by some gentleman

20:17.400 --> 20:21.080
who says that, "You have to become mad to become

20:21.280 --> 20:23.040
a self or a spirit."

20:23.240 --> 20:25.600
Can you imagine such a stupid thing?

20:25.840 --> 20:28.560
It has not happened in any evolution of ours

20:28.760 --> 20:31.480
and why should it happen now that we are human beings,

20:31.680 --> 20:32.840
so beautifully created,

20:33.080 --> 20:36.120
that we have to become mad to become something higher?

20:36.360 --> 20:38.720
I have not heard of any mad person

20:39.000 --> 20:41.760
who becomes higher by becoming mad, so far.

20:42.080 --> 20:44.280
But this kind of a theory is going on.

20:44.480 --> 20:47.960
So you can imagine, how there are delusions

20:48.160 --> 20:49.800
and how there are illusions

20:50.040 --> 20:53.360
and there are sources of these negative forces

20:53.600 --> 20:56.720
which are giving you all the time

20:56.960 --> 21:00.600
the waves and waves of this illusion that you live in this illusion.

21:00.960 --> 21:04.800
So is doubly crowded, is doubly blackened,

21:05.040 --> 21:07.360
and that's how if people cannot find the truth,

21:07.560 --> 21:09.600
I am not surprised about it.

21:09.840 --> 21:13.760
Now this place is called as Bhavasagara

21:14.000 --> 21:18.040
- is the ocean of illusion in which we live.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.080
And we are seekers.

21:20.320 --> 21:25.560
So this one is bestowed upon by ten valencies that are within us,

21:25.840 --> 21:28.160
because we must keep our valencies all right.

21:28.360 --> 21:31.680
Even if you are in the, say, ocean,

21:31.960 --> 21:33.640
our ship should be seaworthy.

21:33.840 --> 21:36.920
Then any kind of illusion is not going to deter us

21:37.120 --> 21:38.680
if we are seaworthy.

21:38.840 --> 21:42.240
But seaworthy means, we must know if there is a fog,

21:42.520 --> 21:45.120
how to move in right direction.

21:45.360 --> 21:48.320
We should know how to overcome all the hazards

21:48.560 --> 21:51.280
of all kinds of storms and all knowledge

21:51.480 --> 21:53.160
should be built-in within us.

21:53.400 --> 21:55.000
And that built-in knowledge

21:55.200 --> 21:59.960
is, this Dharma as they call it, is a religion within you

22:00.160 --> 22:04.240
not without, but within you, which are ten valencies.

22:04.440 --> 22:09.840
As the carbon has four valencies, it has ten valencies.

22:11.120 --> 22:15.480
So we have within us already a built-in system

22:15.720 --> 22:17.720
which gives us this guideline.

22:18.080 --> 22:21.920
But the illusion is such that in that illusion

22:22.120 --> 22:24.920
we develop another problem,

22:25.120 --> 22:28.160
and that is we never listen to right people.

22:28.400 --> 22:33.040
The right people are the ten Primordial Masters

22:33.240 --> 22:34.520
who came on this earth.

22:34.720 --> 22:36.480
They have had many other masters also,

22:36.720 --> 22:38.240
not that they were not right.

22:38.480 --> 22:42.600
But major ten Primordial Masters came on this earth

22:42.840 --> 22:45.640
and they gave us complete knowledge

22:45.920 --> 22:47.800
as to how to balance ourselves

22:48.080 --> 22:50.560
and keep to ourselves as human beings.

22:50.760 --> 22:53.960
But then the question can be asked, "Why this balance? For what?

22:54.240 --> 22:56.360
Why should we have this balance?"

22:56.560 --> 22:59.840
First of all, to keep a good health.

23:00.200 --> 23:04.360
Secondly, to have a very good nature.

23:04.600 --> 23:08.600
Thirdly, to live like a human being with others

23:08.840 --> 23:13.720
and not like donkeys or like lions.

23:14.000 --> 23:18.840
It is a balancing thing which gives you a proper balance

23:19.080 --> 23:23.320
to have a proper society, a proper [UNCLEAR ] life

23:23.520 --> 23:25.720
in which you lead a normal life.

23:25.960 --> 23:28.200
And you are not on your own,

23:28.400 --> 23:31.600
by which you are in relation with the whole.

23:31.840 --> 23:36.920
Now you see the relationship is from there to the whole.

23:37.360 --> 23:41.480
But last of all, this balance is important

23:41.720 --> 23:44.560
that you should achieve your ascent.

23:44.760 --> 23:48.840
Any aeroplane which has got only one wheel will not fly.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.720
Though it has to fly in the air but it has to have two wheels;

23:52.000 --> 23:53.480
it has to have a balance.

23:53.680 --> 23:56.000
An imbalanced thing cannot fly up.

23:56.200 --> 23:58.920
That's why we have to have the balance.

23:59.160 --> 24:02.360
And that is why these Prophets have taught us the methods

24:02.560 --> 24:05.240
of how to balance, balance ourselves,

24:05.480 --> 24:08.480
keep ourselves in balance and don't go to extremes.

24:08.800 --> 24:10.560
But whatever they might try,

24:10.840 --> 24:12.160
whatever they may say,

24:12.360 --> 24:15.720
we just go in the opposite direction

24:15.960 --> 24:17.280
of what they have told us.

24:17.480 --> 24:21.600
And we really go into an extreme condition of fanaticism

24:21.800 --> 24:24.120
or some sort of a torture to ourselves,

24:24.360 --> 24:28.240
or some sort of a great harm to our being.

24:28.480 --> 24:30.240
That's human nature.

24:30.480 --> 24:32.680
That I cannot explain. Why so?

24:32.960 --> 24:35.040
Why they are anxious to ruin themselves,

24:35.280 --> 24:36.920
this is beyond Me to understand,

24:37.120 --> 24:40.320
because God has tried His level best to make you happy.

24:40.560 --> 24:42.320
He has tried to give you everything,

24:42.520 --> 24:44.520
but if you are bent upon ruining yourself,

24:44.760 --> 24:45.840
what can you do?

24:46.080 --> 24:47.400
You see the sun is shining,

24:47.600 --> 24:49.680
and is giving the sunshine to everyone,

24:49.960 --> 24:53.200
but if some leaves want to get inside the mud,

24:53.400 --> 24:55.680
what can the sun do?

24:55.920 --> 24:59.080
I mean, it is like, "Come, bull, and hit me,"

24:59.280 --> 25:02.080
sort of a process people take to.

25:02.280 --> 25:03.640
I don't know why they take it.

25:03.840 --> 25:06.760
This you may be able to explain better, but to My simple mind,

25:07.000 --> 25:08.440
I just don't understand.

25:08.640 --> 25:12.800
So these things happen to us by which we try to ruin ourselves.

25:13.200 --> 25:16.600
Now the first of all, as they said about the curing part of it,

25:16.800 --> 25:18.280
which I must talk to you about,

25:18.480 --> 25:21.120
because it is not such an important thing in Sahaja Yoga,

25:21.320 --> 25:25.800
there is no,

25:26.440 --> 25:28.320
no accent on curing.

25:28.600 --> 25:32.200
I mean, we don't say that, "We cure this and cure that." I mean,

25:32.440 --> 25:37.080
it's not a hospital going on here, nothing of the kind.

25:37.320 --> 25:40.360
It's just that if you get your realization,

25:40.600 --> 25:43.400
as a bi-product you get well. That's it is.

25:43.600 --> 25:46.400
But you see suddenly people ask you questions,

25:46.600 --> 25:50.200
"Can you cure this? Can you?" I don't say, "I cure it."

25:50.400 --> 25:53.640
You are going to cure yourself through your own ascent.

25:53.920 --> 25:55.680
It can work out through Sahaja Yoga.

25:55.960 --> 25:58.200
And then it becomes a headline for everyone,

25:58.400 --> 26:00.560
"She can cure this disease, She can…"

26:00.760 --> 26:03.240
It was surprising that even in the television

26:03.440 --> 26:06.440
they had put Me as a healer and I was amazed to look at Myself.

26:06.640 --> 26:07.840
What is this they have put it?

26:08.120 --> 26:11.200
So they make out of you whatever they like.

26:11.400 --> 26:16.320
In Sahaja Yoga, it is not the healing that is important,

26:16.520 --> 26:18.520
it is becoming is important.

26:18.760 --> 26:21.320
That you become the spirit is important.

26:21.560 --> 26:23.120
You have to become the spirit.

26:23.320 --> 26:26.160
Now, for example, I'll tell you one small thing here,

26:26.360 --> 26:29.280
how imbalance causes so many troubles to us.

26:29.480 --> 26:32.000
There is another center here down below, if you see,

26:32.240 --> 26:35.400
is called as the center of Swadisthana,

26:35.600 --> 26:40.000
which gives aortic plexus

26:40.200 --> 26:44.840
as the gross manifestation of itself.

26:45.160 --> 26:47.800
Now when this center goes into imbalance,

26:48.040 --> 26:51.160
it goes round and round this ocean.

26:51.360 --> 26:54.960
Also it can retract. It can go further.

26:55.400 --> 26:56.480
What happens?

26:56.760 --> 26:59.400
Now this is a center for our future

26:59.600 --> 27:02.000
and for our creativity when it comes to the right.

27:02.240 --> 27:04.960
And when it moves to the left because it has got a step,

27:05.160 --> 27:06.440
like a lotus it moves.

27:06.680 --> 27:07.960
And if it comes to the left,

27:08.160 --> 27:12.360
it acts for something what we call

27:12.640 --> 27:15.960
unauthorized, anti-god activity.

27:16.280 --> 27:18.800
So another one is also unauthorized,

27:19.040 --> 27:23.840
because when we say that, "I am doing that,"

27:24.120 --> 27:26.360
then it is ego, is created in you

27:26.560 --> 27:30.760
and which passes into that pouch there in the head like a balloon

27:31.040 --> 27:36.440
and you form a big institution of ego in your head.

27:36.680 --> 27:39.080
On the other side is this one,

27:39.320 --> 27:42.760
where it comes to the left or any conditioning that takes place,

27:43.040 --> 27:45.680
that people say, "Don't do that, and don't do that,"

27:45.840 --> 27:48.840
and all kinds of conditionings through any kind of teachings,

27:49.080 --> 27:54.840
that creates another institution is called as superego.

27:55.200 --> 27:59.920
Now when we go to the extremes of anything,

28:00.120 --> 28:03.040
how problems are caused, example of that

28:03.240 --> 28:05.840
I will try to give of one center,

28:06.080 --> 28:09.480
because there is no time for Me to cover all the centers.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.400
Take this Swadisthana Chakra.

28:12.680 --> 28:15.560
It has a very important work to do,

28:15.760 --> 28:20.160
is to transform the fat cells of the stomach

28:20.480 --> 28:23.560
for the use of the cells of the brain.

28:23.800 --> 28:26.560
Brain also is made of fat cells,

28:26.760 --> 28:29.120
and when a person thinks,

28:29.400 --> 28:33.840
this special Swadisthana Chakra

28:34.120 --> 28:39.000
converts the fat cells for the use of the brain.

28:39.240 --> 28:41.680
Now, when you think too much for the future,

28:41.960 --> 28:44.440
you think, think, think. I mean, people are mad with thinking.

28:44.600 --> 28:45.760
Some of them did tell Me,

28:46.000 --> 28:50.440
"Mother, you cut my throat, do what You like, but stop my thinking."

28:50.840 --> 28:52.600
It has become another inertia sort of thing.

28:52.800 --> 28:53.720
They just go on thinking.

28:53.960 --> 28:56.680
They just can't stop thinking, whatever they may try.

28:56.920 --> 29:00.200
So when this process starts of thinking,

29:00.400 --> 29:03.360
then what happens that this Swadisthana, poor thing,

29:03.560 --> 29:07.480
goes into a great speedy

29:07.720 --> 29:10.360
process of transforming the fat cells.

29:10.640 --> 29:12.080
Now it has some other work to be done.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.480
Now this is going to the extreme, to think about everything.

29:15.760 --> 29:18.840
Sitting down they will think that now they have become

29:19.160 --> 29:21.040
the Prime Minister of Australia,

29:21.240 --> 29:23.200
so what should they do to correct.

29:23.400 --> 29:24.960
I mean, there's nothing like an election.

29:25.160 --> 29:27.400
Nothing has happened, but they are already thinking

29:27.640 --> 29:29.120
for the Prime Minister.

29:29.360 --> 29:30.520
If they are driving on the street,

29:30.720 --> 29:33.400
they are thinking for all the Police Department.

29:33.760 --> 29:36.240
If they are building one house,

29:36.440 --> 29:38.120
they'll try to find faults with another house

29:38.320 --> 29:39.560
so that he should not have done,

29:39.760 --> 29:42.560
while the house they are going to make might collapse.

29:42.760 --> 29:45.920
But all the time the idea is to see

29:46.120 --> 29:49.760
and think about everything else that doesn't concern them.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.240
So this heavy load on your head

29:52.440 --> 29:57.400
makes it a big ego there.

29:57.680 --> 29:59.960
Apart from that, ego which is a horrid thing,

30:00.160 --> 30:02.040
which can make you absolutely stupid,

30:02.280 --> 30:04.360
but apart from that,

30:04.600 --> 30:07.960
it makes this poor Swadisthana Chakra work so hard

30:08.200 --> 30:12.120
that you neglect other important things in your body,

30:12.360 --> 30:17.440
the organs like your liver.

30:17.840 --> 30:19.480
Such people have very bad livers,

30:19.680 --> 30:22.400
those who think all the time, plan all the time.

30:22.680 --> 30:25.520
They will plan. Even the ladies will plan all the cooking.

30:25.720 --> 30:27.800
Imagine, ladies planning all the cooking.

30:28.040 --> 30:31.080
It's absurd! Because you go to the market,

30:31.280 --> 30:34.320
you have planned for the fish and there is no fish in the market,

30:34.560 --> 30:36.400
and you are upset because you can't cook fish.

30:36.600 --> 30:37.680
But why did you plan?

30:37.920 --> 30:39.800
Whatever you get, you bring it home and cook it.

30:40.040 --> 30:41.160
That's the best way.

30:41.360 --> 30:44.400
So this planning business also goes on too far.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.160
When we go to the extremes it so happens,

30:47.360 --> 30:53.160
that we make this work too hard and we get a liver trouble.

30:53.600 --> 30:57.400
Then we get also the pancreas out of gear,

30:57.600 --> 31:00.160
because pancreas has to work,

31:00.400 --> 31:03.120
has to be worked though this Swadisthana Chakra.

31:03.360 --> 31:06.160
When it is out of gear, the disease you get is diabetes.

31:06.400 --> 31:08.600
The simple thing as diabetes.

31:08.840 --> 31:12.320
Now in India if you go and see the villagers in India,

31:12.560 --> 31:14.640
they take at least five spoons of sugar;

31:14.840 --> 31:16.680
otherwise, they don't think it's a tea.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.600
For tea, they must have five spoons of sugar,

31:19.840 --> 31:22.640
and they never, never suffer from diabetes.

31:22.840 --> 31:27.440
But in the cities, where the people even just touch the sugar,

31:27.640 --> 31:29.280
they get it back in their urine.

31:29.480 --> 31:31.680
So something wrong with the city people.

31:31.960 --> 31:33.400
And what is wrong with them is,

31:33.600 --> 31:35.480
that they are using this Swadisthana Chakra

31:35.680 --> 31:39.680
all the time for thinking and thinking and thinking.

31:40.120 --> 31:42.520
Now another disease that one gets out of it,

31:42.760 --> 31:47.840
is the disease of the spleen, which is a very serious thing.

31:48.360 --> 31:53.640
Spleen produces red blood corpuscles

31:53.920 --> 31:57.000
according to the necessity of the person.

31:57.200 --> 32:03.000
Now, any emergency arises, it starts producing more RBCs.

32:03.360 --> 32:06.760
Our life is such that we are always in emergencies. Everyone is.

32:07.000 --> 32:10.760
Whether he is a shop keeper or he is a minister,

32:11.000 --> 32:13.240
everybody seems to be very busy.

32:13.440 --> 32:16.320
Now, in the morning first of all to read newspapers,

32:16.520 --> 32:17.640
is another curse.

32:17.840 --> 32:20.280
Because you read newspapers, you hear, "This is burnt.

32:20.480 --> 32:22.200
That is finished. So many died.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.000
Somebody in the aeroplane finished off,"

32:24.200 --> 32:25.920
maybe our relations are there

32:26.120 --> 32:29.400
- so you get a real pain there in the stomach.

32:29.600 --> 32:35.320
That's done by this poor spleen. It goes into a big process,

32:35.560 --> 32:41.040
into a very big mechanical production

32:41.240 --> 32:43.840
of RBC starts.

32:44.120 --> 32:48.680
Now when that happens to you then you don't know

32:48.920 --> 32:53.440
that you better keep the spleen now at least

32:53.720 --> 32:55.240
little rested for other things.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.960
But just then you will ask for a breakfast.

32:58.200 --> 32:59.360
You will get into the car,

32:59.560 --> 33:01.560
with a breakfast in your hand eating that.

33:01.800 --> 33:03.440
And there is a jam in the way,

33:03.640 --> 33:06.240
and then you are screaming at, because you are late.

33:06.440 --> 33:08.400
All sorts of things happen to us like that

33:08.600 --> 33:13.600
and we go on creating emergencies for ourselves. For what?

33:13.840 --> 33:16.400
What are we going to gain out of it?

33:16.640 --> 33:19.640
With this hurry and scurry what have we achieved?

33:19.840 --> 33:22.400
So this spleen goes out of order.

33:22.680 --> 33:25.200
It does not understand the crazy person.

33:25.440 --> 33:27.160
It becomes crazy itself.

33:27.360 --> 33:29.760
And it starts producing red blood corpuscles,

33:30.000 --> 33:30.720
this thing, that thing.

33:30.960 --> 33:32.240
Now you become vulnerable

33:32.440 --> 33:36.200
to a horrible disease called as leukemia.

33:36.440 --> 33:38.480
Of course, it is triggered by something else,

33:38.680 --> 33:41.560
about which I may be able to tell you, today or tomorrow.

33:41.800 --> 33:45.080
But you are just vulnerable for a disease

33:45.280 --> 33:47.600
called leukemia where just doctors will say

33:47.840 --> 33:50.400
you may die within one month or two months.

33:50.600 --> 33:53.360
That's all they can say about leukemia.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.600
Now such a person doesn't realize that,

33:55.800 --> 34:00.200
"I have brought this disease upon myself by being like this."

34:00.520 --> 34:02.360
We are human beings.

34:02.600 --> 34:07.320
We cannot rattle like tins.

34:07.520 --> 34:09.520
We have to live like human beings.

34:09.760 --> 34:12.720
The way we rattle ourselves morning till evening

34:12.960 --> 34:15.600
is so dangerous for our being

34:15.840 --> 34:18.120
that we must have a balance in our lives.

34:18.320 --> 34:22.040
We must learn how to rest. And rest is also another problem.

34:22.280 --> 34:23.640
Then they will go to the sea,

34:23.840 --> 34:25.920
burn themselves up, completely extreme.

34:26.120 --> 34:28.120
I don't know why this fashion has started from where.

34:28.320 --> 34:30.680
Must be somebody must have put this into the ideas.

34:30.920 --> 34:32.000
You see, this is a very recent one.

34:32.200 --> 34:34.800
About twenty years back nobody bothered about sun-bathing.

34:35.040 --> 34:36.400
Nobody knew about it.

34:36.600 --> 34:39.080
When, you see, I just don't understand also

34:39.280 --> 34:42.640
the psychology of the West when they don't like black people

34:42.840 --> 34:43.920
- they are immigration problem -

34:44.120 --> 34:47.840
why do they want to become black themselves?

34:50.000 --> 34:52.280
They tan themselves. There are tanning companies,

34:52.480 --> 34:54.960
this, that, all kinds of things have started

34:55.160 --> 34:57.920
and that's how they, you know, you get the disease

34:58.160 --> 35:01.520
called cancer of the skin, which is a very serious disease.

35:01.760 --> 35:04.440
And this beauty fashion is also for whom?

35:04.640 --> 35:07.520
I mean, I just don't understand that in India people think that

35:07.720 --> 35:10.320
you are very good-looking people because you are fair,

35:10.560 --> 35:12.080
and here you think Indians are better

35:12.240 --> 35:13.840
because they have got darker skins.

35:14.160 --> 35:16.240
So whatever we have, we are not satisfied with it.

35:16.440 --> 35:17.640
But it's not so important that

35:17.840 --> 35:20.960
we should kill ourselves with this sun-tanning to that extreme.

35:21.200 --> 35:22.520
So that sort of an extreme

35:22.720 --> 35:25.920
you do it with this Swadisthana Chakra,

35:26.160 --> 35:29.640
and you have problems of this kind.

35:29.920 --> 35:33.640
But also your tension can rise if you use too much of

35:33.920 --> 35:35.200
this Swadisthana Chakra because

35:35.400 --> 35:37.680
your kidneys also become poor things.

35:37.960 --> 35:40.840
They don't know how to adjust to your madness.

35:41.080 --> 35:42.160
They way you lead your life,

35:42.360 --> 35:43.600
you don't think you are a human being.

35:43.800 --> 35:45.800
You think you are an supersonic aeroplane.

35:46.040 --> 35:47.760
Then poor kidneys don't know how to work you out.

35:48.000 --> 35:50.240
I mean, you are made by God, not by human beings

35:50.520 --> 35:53.080
who have made super-sonic aeroplanes, this, that.

35:53.320 --> 35:55.720
And the super-sonic aeroplane doesn't think.

35:56.000 --> 35:59.000
First of all it saves its energy because it doesn't think.

35:59.200 --> 36:01.000
First of all when you think,

36:01.200 --> 36:03.040
you are spending most of your energy,

36:03.240 --> 36:07.200
and actually the way you spend your energy with an extreme way,

36:07.400 --> 36:10.360
you develop all these horrible diseases.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.760
Now what happens actually

36:12.000 --> 36:14.360
when you start doing too much to the right or to the left?

36:14.600 --> 36:16.480
Now, the right side is a thing

36:16.680 --> 36:20.400
where people become extremely fanatic, very disciplined.

36:20.600 --> 36:23.600
All military people, you see, hot-tempered.

36:23.800 --> 36:25.800
You can't just go near them.

36:26.080 --> 36:27.640
If you go near them you will get nothing

36:27.840 --> 36:29.560
but heat coming out of them.

36:29.800 --> 36:32.960
They are very hot-tempered people, angry people.

36:33.160 --> 36:34.160
They lose their temper.

36:34.360 --> 36:35.600
You just can't talk to them

36:35.800 --> 36:38.120
because if you say a word, they will box your nose.

36:38.320 --> 36:41.440
This type of people are so many in this world, you can't imagine.

36:41.640 --> 36:43.200
So many of them are, I have seen.

36:43.400 --> 36:45.600
I am amazed how they exist with themselves.

36:45.840 --> 36:48.320
Why don't they box themselves sometimes? They might be.

36:48.600 --> 36:51.240
They are full of anger, frustration and

36:51.480 --> 36:55.960
all kinds of bad feelings about others and about themselves.

36:56.320 --> 36:58.480
All these people, all this kind of people,

36:58.720 --> 37:01.080
come up when you become very austere.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.200
You say, "Oh, I will have no indulgences.

37:03.440 --> 37:07.960
I am absolutely living on a shoe-string

37:08.200 --> 37:11.080
and eating just two leaves per day."

37:11.280 --> 37:15.280
Such people will thin out and they will look like mosquitoes.

37:15.520 --> 37:18.440
But I don't mind their looks,

37:18.640 --> 37:22.800
but the way they bite you, is the worst part.

37:25.000 --> 37:27.360
And they are sometimes regarded as the beauties.

37:27.560 --> 37:29.640
Then God save us from the beauties,

37:29.840 --> 37:34.400
because if they become the world beauties [UNCLEAR]

37:34.600 --> 37:38.480
whatever beauty contest, you see, so, models, this, that,

37:38.680 --> 37:41.680
then they are lost people, absolutely lost to any senses.

37:41.920 --> 37:44.120
They become really stupid.

37:44.360 --> 37:46.760
Now this kind of extremity comes to the right side.

37:47.000 --> 37:51.640
The left side comes when you indulge into something like drugs.

37:51.920 --> 37:53.800
Now people might say, "What's wrong in drugs?"

37:54.040 --> 37:57.760
It does such a damage to you. It does.

37:58.040 --> 38:01.000
People may not believe it, but it does.

38:01.240 --> 38:05.120
It does finish you off on your left side.

38:05.360 --> 38:08.600
As the alcohol may finish off your liver,

38:08.840 --> 38:13.040
the left side is completely jammed by the drugs you take,

38:13.240 --> 38:16.360
because you move more towards the left.

38:16.640 --> 38:17.960
And the more you move,

38:18.160 --> 38:21.840
you go from your subconscious to the collective subconscious,

38:22.080 --> 38:25.160
and then you are attacked by negative forces,

38:25.360 --> 38:27.840
and that's why it attacks your brain also.

38:28.080 --> 38:30.800
Such people can just become gradually into

38:31.240 --> 38:33.600
into a state of just like cabbages

38:33.840 --> 38:36.400
and they would not even realize how it is happening.

38:36.640 --> 38:39.280
So all these things are harmful to us.

38:39.560 --> 38:43.280
Indulgences into anything can make you left-sided.

38:43.560 --> 38:44.800
Eating too much,

38:45.080 --> 38:48.400
there is one person eating two leaves, another is eating so much.

38:48.680 --> 38:51.400
See, all these extreme behaviors, as I said,

38:51.600 --> 38:53.200
create a very big problem.

38:53.440 --> 38:55.960
Now how cancer can be caused, we have to see.

38:56.200 --> 38:58.080
Then I will move to other things.

38:58.280 --> 39:01.360
That, supposing this is the center,

39:01.640 --> 39:04.760
and this center has got left side and right side.

39:05.080 --> 39:08.640
At every emergency, both the sympathetic nervous systems

39:08.840 --> 39:12.320
which are expressed by these two Nadis

39:12.600 --> 39:16.640
go into action, and when too much action starts,

39:16.840 --> 39:20.600
what happens, the relationship is broken.

39:20.960 --> 39:24.960
And the deities, who are controlling these, go off to sleep.

39:25.160 --> 39:28.840
And when the relationship with the whole is broken,

39:29.120 --> 39:32.440
when it is broken, then

39:32.680 --> 39:36.800
you have no control from the main,

39:37.080 --> 39:39.200
you can say, from the whole,

39:39.400 --> 39:42.160
and the cells become on their own.

39:42.360 --> 39:45.720
When they become on their own, so individualistic,

39:45.960 --> 39:48.240
they become malignant.

39:48.480 --> 39:50.600
For example, if it happens in the stomach,

39:50.840 --> 39:53.760
you will find the liver will become so big.

39:54.040 --> 39:56.240
Or if it happened in the mouth or nose,

39:56.480 --> 39:59.440
the nose will become so big. The rest of has no chance.

39:59.640 --> 40:01.200
It's a very ego-oriented stuff.

40:01.400 --> 40:03.840
It goes increasing, increasing.

40:04.120 --> 40:06.600
And also if you live with an ego-oriented man,

40:06.800 --> 40:08.160
you can become also ego-oriented.

40:08.360 --> 40:11.080
Hitler is one of the examples of that,

40:11.320 --> 40:14.320
how he made people ego-oriented and so stupid.

40:14.560 --> 40:20.240
Actually so horrible by his own great ego that he developed.

40:20.520 --> 40:22.960
So these cells also become like that

40:23.160 --> 40:25.560
and they make other cells also malignant

40:25.760 --> 40:28.040
and that's how the cancer is settled.

40:28.280 --> 40:30.720
Now to such a patient, what have we to do?

40:31.040 --> 40:33.480
You have to try to raise his Kundalini.

40:33.680 --> 40:39.160
By giving some power there at that point, you can pacify.

40:39.520 --> 40:42.080
You can give some additional, as you call the petrol,

40:42.280 --> 40:43.800
to the exhausted one.

40:44.040 --> 40:46.040
And gradually when it is done,

40:46.240 --> 40:48.360
it comes back to its normal  [UNCLEAR:could be - 'ways' OR 'phase'].

40:48.560 --> 40:50.800
Then you put the Kundalini through it.

40:51.040 --> 40:54.640
So it makes an ascent and keeps it in place.

40:54.920 --> 40:58.200
It awakens the deity in that center

40:58.400 --> 41:01.760
and that center looks after the gross side of life.

41:02.000 --> 41:04.320
That is how cancer can be cured.

41:04.560 --> 41:07.440
It's true that Sahaja Yoga has cured cancer

41:07.680 --> 41:09.480
of so many people and some people in

41:09.680 --> 41:11.440
ten minutes have got rid of their cancer.

41:11.640 --> 41:13.760
Ten minutes, is a fact.

41:14.040 --> 41:17.640
But that doesn't mean that I am going to cure everybody's cancer,

41:17.840 --> 41:20.000
by any chance. It is not so.

41:20.200 --> 41:21.840
You see, the trouble with people is,

41:22.120 --> 41:25.840
they say, "Do you claim you can cure cancer?"

41:26.120 --> 41:29.600
I say, "I don't claim. But Sahaja Yoga can do it."

41:29.840 --> 41:31.680
"Then you must cure this cancer."

41:31.960 --> 41:35.120
I said, "Why? Why should I cure?

41:35.360 --> 41:37.520
Are you paying Me something?

41:37.720 --> 41:38.720
Have you called Me here?

41:38.960 --> 41:40.240
I have come My own.

41:40.480 --> 41:43.120
If I want I will; otherwise, I will not."

41:43.360 --> 41:47.200
You see, it is like a aggression of this kind on a person that,

41:47.400 --> 41:48.920
"You must show how you can cure."

41:49.120 --> 41:52.040
Why should I show? I don't want to show it.

41:52.280 --> 41:55.640
Like I had a very big lecture in the medical college,

41:55.920 --> 41:57.400
medical institute in India,

41:57.600 --> 41:59.960
and of course the Vice Chancellor was very much impressed.

42:00.160 --> 42:02.160
But some of the doctors they came and they said,

42:02.360 --> 42:04.680
"Mother, we will give you four patients of cancer

42:04.960 --> 42:05.800
and you cure them."

42:06.040 --> 42:09.600
I said, "I have no time. I am very busy.

42:09.840 --> 42:11.640
You better ask them to come to Sahaja Yoga,

42:11.840 --> 42:13.400
get their realization and cure themselves.

42:13.600 --> 42:15.160
I have no time for that. I am sorry.

42:15.400 --> 42:16.840
I am busy with other work."

42:17.120 --> 42:18.800
So, then they said, "All right.

42:19.040 --> 42:21.400
Do you have any file of the patients you've cured?"

42:21.600 --> 42:25.280
I said, "I have none. I have no time for filing."

42:25.560 --> 42:26.800
It just flows. It just works.

42:27.000 --> 42:28.640
What am I to write down everywhere?

42:28.920 --> 42:31.560
This is it. I have cured this x, y, z, for what?

42:31.840 --> 42:34.840
I have no clientele. I do not have to cash it.

42:35.080 --> 42:36.440
So why should I do it?

42:36.680 --> 42:38.440
It's just flowing. Those who want to have it,

42:38.640 --> 42:40.640
can have it and can work it out.

42:40.840 --> 42:42.240
But you cannot force Me

42:42.480 --> 42:45.080
that,  "You must write down and …", for what?

42:45.320 --> 42:46.960
What is the purpose?

42:47.160 --> 42:48.960
I am not running a hospital.

42:49.160 --> 42:53.240
I don't have to have a credibility on that, if I cure or not.

42:53.480 --> 42:56.200
For that doctors have to get their realization first.

42:56.440 --> 42:58.840
If they don't get their realization, I am not bothered.

42:59.080 --> 43:00.800
If they are really bothered about cancer,

43:01.040 --> 43:04.120
or any other disease, why don't they take their realization

43:04.320 --> 43:06.160
and help their patients? They can.

43:06.360 --> 43:08.520
But the patients who are not interested in God,

43:08.720 --> 43:10.920
God is also not interested in those patients.

43:11.160 --> 43:14.000
It's common sense. God has the greatest common sense.

43:14.200 --> 43:16.760
The lights which are never going to work out,

43:17.000 --> 43:18.320
which are absolutely useless,

43:18.560 --> 43:20.840
you are not going to repair them, will you?

43:21.200 --> 43:22.800
No human being is going to do that.

43:23.040 --> 43:24.200
What's the use of repairing a light

43:24.400 --> 43:25.640
which is never going to work out?

43:25.840 --> 43:27.840
So God is also like that.

43:28.120 --> 43:29.600
He has such a lot of common sense.

43:29.760 --> 43:31.760
He is not going to waste His energy for these things.

43:32.000 --> 43:36.360
The most important thing today is not to cure people

43:36.560 --> 43:38.480
but to give them realization;

43:38.680 --> 43:43.560
to redeem them, to evolve them, is the main part.

43:43.840 --> 43:47.080
You can be counseled, you can be told, everything explained,

43:47.280 --> 43:49.280
you can be brought to logically conclusion.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.360
But the aim is to get your realization

43:52.600 --> 43:54.680
and not to worry about your illness.

43:54.960 --> 43:56.720
Illness will disappear gradually.

43:57.000 --> 43:58.600
It has happened with so many people

43:58.840 --> 44:00.080
and it should happen with you.

44:00.280 --> 44:01.560
But it should not be a condition,

44:01.800 --> 44:04.280
that you come to Sahaja Yoga as an obligation on us

44:04.480 --> 44:06.680
that,  "We have come to Sahaja Yoga, you better now."

44:06.960 --> 44:10.800
That's not so, because, as you know, we have no organization.

44:11.080 --> 44:12.680
There is no organization that we have.

44:12.960 --> 44:15.840
You have to come humbly to it, and it works out.

44:16.120 --> 44:19.600
God is the ocean of compassion, ocean of love.

44:19.800 --> 44:21.560
He is the one who is so anxious

44:21.800 --> 44:23.720
that you all should enter into His kingdom

44:24.000 --> 44:26.600
to occupy your great seats as His children.

44:26.840 --> 44:29.200
He is the Father of the Fathers.

44:29.400 --> 44:32.280
He is the most loving Father you could think of.

44:32.520 --> 44:36.840
Then when we challenge Him like this, He doesn't like it.

44:37.160 --> 44:40.080
We have to enter into His kingdom in a humble way,

44:40.280 --> 44:43.320
and He will definitely bestow His blessings on all of you,

44:43.520 --> 44:45.480
because He is the one who is so anxious.

44:45.720 --> 44:49.120
I Myself amazed at the way He is blessing people.

44:49.360 --> 44:52.600
Imagine six thousand people before Me, they just get realization.

44:52.840 --> 44:54.600
Can you imagine such a thing happening?

44:54.800 --> 44:56.400
I have seen Myself. It's happening.

44:56.600 --> 44:58.840
So many things are happening today

44:59.080 --> 45:01.720
that is evident that God is very gracious,

45:02.000 --> 45:04.400
as well as He is wrathful.

45:04.640 --> 45:06.520
He is a wrathful God for people

45:06.720 --> 45:09.520
who do not take to Him.

45:09.720 --> 45:12.640
He is wrathful. And that's why one has to be careful.

45:12.840 --> 45:15.600
If you lead a life on your own - "What's wrong?"

45:15.840 --> 45:19.640
"What's wrong" is one of the philosophies people have

45:19.960 --> 45:24.080
- then you have to pay for it, this way or that way.

45:24.320 --> 45:27.600
So as a Mother I have to tell you that, "Why not?"

45:27.840 --> 45:29.400
When you have got everything.

45:29.720 --> 45:31.640
You have got the spirit within you.

45:31.840 --> 45:33.400
Is the power is within you.

45:33.680 --> 45:36.320
Everything is there. Why not get your realization?

45:36.560 --> 45:40.360
Why succumb to this useless ego which is not yourself?

45:40.640 --> 45:43.840
You are not your ego. You are your self.

45:44.120 --> 45:45.960
You are your spirit.

45:46.160 --> 45:48.640
And that spirit, when it comes to your attention,

45:48.840 --> 45:50.720
you become such a wonderful person.

45:51.000 --> 45:52.600
The whole thing is lost.

45:52.840 --> 45:56.520
Like a lotus rising out of the mud,

45:56.760 --> 45:59.560
it covers the whole of that pond

45:59.800 --> 46:02.960
and its fragrance fills the atmosphere with such beauty.

46:03.200 --> 46:05.200
That's what happens to you when you get it.

46:05.440 --> 46:06.640
So why not have that?

46:06.840 --> 46:08.960
This is your own, within your self,

46:09.160 --> 46:10.760
and the Divine is so anxious.

46:11.000 --> 46:13.280
I don't know what is the missing point.

46:13.520 --> 46:15.840
Today, I am sorry they have today called Me

46:16.200 --> 46:18.520
after this program for a radio, and I am going there.

46:18.800 --> 46:21.360
I don't know how many people are going to attack Me on the phone.

46:21.600 --> 46:23.400
You see, all kinds of things they say on the phone.

46:23.600 --> 46:25.440
But I told them I will not receive the phone.

46:25.640 --> 46:27.120
You better receive the phone and let Me know.

46:27.320 --> 46:29.120
Because all these things are subject to,

46:29.320 --> 46:33.480
I find that people use it for just call sometimes,

46:33.680 --> 46:35.440
for not expressing anything good

46:35.680 --> 46:37.920
but for expressing something that's

46:38.160 --> 46:42.440
inside them anti-God, absolutely anti-God thing.

46:42.640 --> 46:44.560
I hope today they will behave themselves

46:44.800 --> 46:47.800
and it will be a good time for them

46:48.080 --> 46:50.160
that they should enjoy the bliss of God.

46:50.360 --> 46:53.600
I must thank for people who rang Me up to say

46:53.800 --> 46:58.360
that they received their vibrations on the television.

46:58.600 --> 47:00.120
And that they telephoned to Me

47:00.360 --> 47:01.800
and they found out My phone number,

47:02.040 --> 47:04.440
because My phone number was not available.

47:04.680 --> 47:06.920
And it should happen to all of you today,

47:07.120 --> 47:08.400
that you should get your realization.

47:08.600 --> 47:11.320
So the first intense feeling should be

47:11.520 --> 47:15.000
that we should get our realization, somehow we get it,

47:15.200 --> 47:18.240
and then we will talk about the rest of the things.

47:18.520 --> 47:22.560
Yesterday I gave a lot of time for questions.

47:22.840 --> 47:28.440
And today I think we have very little time.

47:28.640 --> 47:31.160
But still I can allow you to ask two-three questions

47:31.360 --> 47:35.600
and then we should go ahead with the procedure of realization.

47:35.840 --> 47:38.160
But too many questions are not needed.

47:38.360 --> 47:40.040
What you need is your realization.

47:40.240 --> 47:41.800
Actually, if you ask too many questions,

47:42.040 --> 47:43.640
sometimes the realization doesn't work out.

47:43.840 --> 47:45.680
Not to frighten you but I tell you,

47:45.960 --> 47:47.240
because your mind starts working.

47:47.440 --> 47:49.720
You have to, you see, take it beyond your mind.

47:49.960 --> 47:53.240
Tomorrow I'll tell you about that great chakra of Agnya,

47:53.480 --> 47:56.080
which is bestowed upon the deity of Jesus Christ.

47:56.320 --> 47:58.600
That how, when the Kundalini rises through it,

47:58.800 --> 48:03.320
how He sucks in these two horrible things called ego and superego,

48:03.600 --> 48:07.320
and how you become thoughtlessly aware and you come in the present.

48:07.560 --> 48:11.960
And you become, when it comes out of your fontanel bone area,

48:12.160 --> 48:15.360
the real baptism takes place and you get connected.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.720
You get connected with the whole

48:18.000 --> 48:20.400
and you become collectively conscious. You become.

48:20.600 --> 48:21.800
Again I say, it is actualization.

48:22.040 --> 48:24.520
It is not just talking that, "We are all brothers and sisters,"

48:24.720 --> 48:27.600
but you just become it, comes in your awareness.

48:27.840 --> 48:32.400
And you start feeling the other person on your fingertips,

48:32.600 --> 48:34.320
yourself, on your fingertips.

48:34.560 --> 48:35.800
As Mohammed has said,

48:36.080 --> 48:39.520
"At the time of resurrection, your hands will speak."

48:39.720 --> 48:42.840
He has spoken more about this time than about the doomsday.

48:43.080 --> 48:45.200
But all the Muslims are talking about the doomsday only.

48:45.400 --> 48:47.960
I don't know why they are waiting for that before this.

48:48.160 --> 48:49.920
So first the resurrection time has to come

48:50.120 --> 48:53.600
because in all graciousness and kindness and compassion of God,

48:53.840 --> 48:56.640
He is going to give us a full chance to achieve ourselves,

48:56.920 --> 48:58.200
because this is His creation.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.840
He is anxious to do it.

49:01.160 --> 49:03.600
He doesn't want His creation to be destroyed.

49:03.800 --> 49:06.840
So, may God bless you.
