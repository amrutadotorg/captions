00:00:02.375 --> 00:00:06.083
How are you? Please,

00:00:07.542 --> 00:00:13.250
What’s your name? REPORTER: My name is David [Cooper?], I am (inaudible)

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.083
Can You tell me why You have come along

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.500
to Northampton here this week?

00:00:18.709 --> 00:00:19.542
SHRI MATAJI: Why I have come here?

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.625
REPORTER: Why You have come along here were you invited by a....

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:27.125
SHRI MATAJI: It’s a sort of a… kind of a message I have,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that a discovery has been made now of a method.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:36.834
REPORTER: Is this the first time that You’ve come to Northampton?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.375
SHRI MATAJI: No, I’ve come before also.

00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.041
REPORTER: And what sort of response did You get then?

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:46.291
SHRI MATAJI: Response was, I wouldn’t say very good.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.917
No newspaper didn’t come at all.

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:52.291
Yesterday also there was no one, it’s very surprising.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.333
REPORTER: You found a lot of people were very skeptical, did You?

00:00:56.625 --> 00:00:57.625
SHRI MATAJI: I don’t know what they were like,

00:00:57.834 --> 00:01:00.458
because no-, nobody came, you see.

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:02.166
REPORTER: That was the Guild Hall as well?

00:01:02.375 --> 00:01:05.208
SHRI MATAJI: No, Guildhall yesterday we had lots of people, yesterday.

00:01:05.417 --> 00:01:07.542
But as far as the newspapers were concerned,

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.792
We met some people here.

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:12.959
But most of them came to see Me, when I came here first.

00:01:13.125 --> 00:01:15.999
They were sort of a labor class people.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.500
They were suffering from all kinds of maladies

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.709
like possessions and things, and one gentleman just got up

00:01:21.917 --> 00:01:24.625
and started walking all around the places and talking like …

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:26.542
it was a bit funny.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.917
REPORTER: In fact, You were in Bedford last night, weren't You?

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:30.000
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I was there.

00:01:30.208 --> 00:01:31.166
REPORTER: And how did that go?

00:01:31.375 --> 00:01:33.041
SHRI MATAJI: Very good, very well.

00:01:33.291 --> 00:01:35.875
REPORTER: It went very well. In the past, I understand, that You’ve, um,

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:39.375
You’ve helped heal an awful lot of people? SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

00:01:39.583 --> 00:01:42.125
REPORTER: Can You give me some examples of some of the more,

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.166
extraordinary healings You’ve done?

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.875
SHRI MATAJI: Anything, you see, like cancer.

00:01:48.041 --> 00:01:51.792
Then, we can say, blood cancer specially.

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:55.417
A Sahaja Yogini has cured one friend's blood cancer.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:01:58.917
Then diabetes.

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.750
REPORTER: In fact, I understand, on one occasion You had

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:03.709
a blind woman cometo see you, is that right?

00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:06.542
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, blindness — if the eyes are open.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.291
REPORTER: Which one was that exactly? What was happening?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.000
SHRI MATAJI: That is due to a possession, on the backside,

00:02:11.208 --> 00:02:13.000
the optic lobe we have here.

00:02:13.208 --> 00:02:15.667
You see, if that gets possessed by a live entity,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:18.959
your eyes are open but there’s darkness, you can’t see anything.

00:02:19.125 --> 00:02:23.000
And if you know how to open that and get rid of the possession…

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.709
And the deaf person hearing, yeah…

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.834
REPORTER: You’ve actually cured deafness as well, have You?

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.583
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I did. There in Geneva it happened.

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.458
REPORTER: Do You — I mean, it’s very difficult for people

00:02:32.667 --> 00:02:34.208
to actually understand how it’s done.

00:02:34.417 --> 00:02:36.500
I mean they, you know, it all seems just a bit mystical and, you know …

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.792
SHRI MATAJI: Yeah. It is nothing mystical, I tell you,

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:40.875
there’s nothing mystical.

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:43.750
Like we see a flower becoming a fruit.

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.417
We take it for granted, isn’t it?

00:02:46.625 --> 00:02:51.250
Do we find it mystical ? Because we see it every day.

00:02:51.583 --> 00:02:55.041
But there is something, some power that does that, doesn’t it?

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.458
Supposing you become

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.999
the owner of that power, say, or if you have that power within you.

00:03:01.458 --> 00:03:03.667
You can also do many things.

00:03:03.875 --> 00:03:05.583
REPORTER: But, nonetheless, I mean,

00:03:05.792 --> 00:03:10.291
if I have an illness I go to see a doctor, he gives me tablets or so on…

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.750
I mean, to actually to come and see You

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.709
and You say I’ve got the power within me to cure myself…

00:03:15.917 --> 00:03:17.667
I mean, how do you actually get this power?

00:03:17.875 --> 00:03:21.208
SHRI MATAJI: You see, what happens: when you become realized,

00:03:21.417 --> 00:03:24.250
or we become — it’s called twice-born —

00:03:24.542 --> 00:03:27.542
then you become collectively conscious, you become.

00:03:27.792 --> 00:03:29.792
It is not that I just tell you

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.291
and it’s a brain treatment or something,

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.792
or brainwash, that I say,

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:36.417
“All right, now you have become this and this.”

00:03:36.625 --> 00:03:40.083
You really become, that you start feeling them —

00:03:40.291 --> 00:03:42.417
they are centres on your fingertips.

00:03:42.667 --> 00:03:45.000
REPORTER: So you actually feel them? SHRI MATAJI: On the fingertips.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.917
You can, everyone can feel it very clearly.

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:49.542
REPORTER: So this is like a guide, this is the way to diagnose

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.083
SHRI MATAJI: Diagnosis. You see, you are the doctor,

00:03:52.291 --> 00:03:55.917
you are the diagnosis, you could be patient also.

00:03:56.083 --> 00:03:59.041
And you are the medicine.

00:03:59.542 --> 00:04:00.959
REPORTER: So once you’ve diagnosed what's wrong…

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:04.208
SHRI MATAJI: Then you should know how to cure a particular centre.

00:04:04.417 --> 00:04:07.375
For example, now, which is the Christ centre? It’s this one.

00:04:07.583 --> 00:04:10.959
These two are Christ centres,

00:04:11.166 --> 00:04:14.041
in the pituitary and pineal. Now what are the diseases you get?

00:04:14.291 --> 00:04:17.458
All the diseases of the eyes you get out of it.

00:04:17.667 --> 00:04:19.542
Others are possessions.

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.999
You see, people are mentally depressed, this, that —

00:04:22.208 --> 00:04:25.000
all this is due to the problem of this centre.

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.125
There could be ego problems also.

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:30.166
People are egoistical, you see, and very bombastic,

00:04:30.375 --> 00:04:33.208
and they try to destroy others with their ego.

00:04:33.458 --> 00:04:36.583
All these problems can be solved if you can awaken Christ within you.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:41.250
Because it’s said that He died for our sins.

00:04:41.709 --> 00:04:46.709
REPORTER: And using this healing method You've got, that actually awakens powers [of healing]

00:04:46.917 --> 00:04:49.583
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. You just have to say Lord's prayer before Me

00:04:49.792 --> 00:04:52.834
and He awakens because I am connected with Him, you see.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.583
So when you say something to Me,

00:04:54.792 --> 00:04:57.083
that connection is just made, and that is awakened,

00:04:57.333 --> 00:05:00.083
and there is ego and superego in your head, which are sucked in,

00:05:00.291 --> 00:05:02.625
means your actions — that is your karmas —

00:05:02.834 --> 00:05:04.500
and your sins all are sucked in.

00:05:04.709 --> 00:05:06.375
Once they are sucked in, this portion opens up.

00:05:06.583 --> 00:05:09.500
When this opens up, you get the the Kundalini up.

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:12.375
That is, it’s very simple, you know, because it’s all done.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:16.375
For example, now look at this. To look at this, looks very simple,

00:05:16.583 --> 00:05:18.959
but it might be quite complicated inside.

00:05:19.125 --> 00:05:21.166
And it has taken years to make it.

00:05:21.417 --> 00:05:24.875
So the whole thing has taken ages to make it. This human body

00:05:25.041 --> 00:05:27.500
has come out of amoeba to this stage;

00:05:27.709 --> 00:05:31.583
even from matter to this stage. All that is built within you.

00:05:31.792 --> 00:05:35.000
Not only that, but what is going to happen to you

00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:37.999
is also existing within you in your heart; the Spirit.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:41.875
Now, only thing, that last [ ] breakthrough has to take place.

00:05:42.041 --> 00:05:44.750
That is also built within you, that is sahaja —

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:47.417
means built within you. It is born within you.

00:05:47.667 --> 00:05:50.875
Sahaja is “born within”. So it’s all within you.

00:05:51.041 --> 00:05:54.083
And just if somebody knows how to do the job,

00:05:54.291 --> 00:05:56.166
the one who could have capacity…

00:05:56.375 --> 00:05:59.125
Like the Mother Earth has the capacity to sprout the seed.

00:05:59.333 --> 00:06:02.083
We can’t do it otherwise, if you do grow, do anything, you can't.

00:06:02.291 --> 00:06:05.917
It’s a living process. But the Mother… Mother Earth can help.

00:06:06.166 --> 00:06:08.041
You put it there and you get it.

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:11.208
In the same way, it is supposing I have the capacity, I can do it.

00:06:11.417 --> 00:06:13.625
Supposing you get the light tomorrow, you can do it.

00:06:13.792 --> 00:06:15.750
You can enlighten another person.

00:06:16.083 --> 00:06:18.083
One enlightened person can enlighten another person

00:06:18.291 --> 00:06:20.500
but he has to be enlightened first of all.

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:23.041
REPORTER: Do You find that, I mean, as You say, I mean,

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:25.999
once people have seen You and discovered how it can work,

00:06:26.166 --> 00:06:28.291
they can spread the word? SHRI MATAJI: Yes.

00:06:28.542 --> 00:06:31.166
REPORTER: But nonetheless You say You met a lot of skeptical people last time.

00:06:31.375 --> 00:06:34.750
Do You think that that is the basic problem I mean that…

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:36.917
through this healing process You have

00:06:37.083 --> 00:06:39.625
could be much more widely used and sort of...

00:06:39.792 --> 00:06:41.875
SHRI MATAJI: You see, but I’ve seen people who come for healing,

00:06:42.041 --> 00:06:44.750
just get satisfied at that point when they are healed up.

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:46.166
They don’t go further.

00:06:46.375 --> 00:06:49.125
You see you must say that God also has common sense;

00:06:49.458 --> 00:06:51.999
that He would like to only heal people, normally,

00:06:52.166 --> 00:06:56.583
like we would like to only construct,

00:06:56.834 --> 00:07:00.959
improve, or repair those lamps which will give lights, isn’t it?

00:07:01.125 --> 00:07:03.542
So those who are not going to work it out;

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.709
the interest is less.

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:06.792
But still it works, I mean, it’s compassion,

00:07:06.999 --> 00:07:09.041
so it cures, people get cured, no doubt.

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.875
But out of them I find very few really come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:12.041 --> 00:07:15.375
who come through healing. But those who have seeking of the Spirit

00:07:15.625 --> 00:07:17.750
they are a special category of people.

00:07:17.959 --> 00:07:19.792
They are extremely beautiful people

00:07:19.999 --> 00:07:22.041
and they are seeking. Maybe they are taking drugs,

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.583
going to wrong gurus, whatever they are doing.

00:07:24.792 --> 00:07:25.917
That’s a different point.

00:07:26.083 --> 00:07:28.959
But they are seekers, basically they are seekers of the truth

00:07:29.125 --> 00:07:30.583
and they are the best people.

00:07:30.792 --> 00:07:34.083
And they are the ones who are meant for Sahaja Yoga,

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:36.750
not the people who just want their body to be all right.

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:40.125
What’s the use of having the body, what are you going to do with it?

00:07:40.333 --> 00:07:41.917
You see, this body might have a meaning.

00:07:42.083 --> 00:07:44.999
And those who are finding the meaning are the best helped.

00:07:45.166 --> 00:07:47.000
Of course, they get rid of all their maladies

00:07:47.208 --> 00:07:49.291
and everything that’s… as a by-product.

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:51.792
But that’s the main thing, that’s important.

00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.875
REPORTER: I understand that Your husband, in fact,

00:07:54.041 --> 00:07:56.208
holds a very eminent position. SHRI MATAJI: Yes, he is.

00:07:56.417 --> 00:07:58.041
REPORTER: Can You tell me a little bit about that?

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:03.083
SHRI MATAJI: He is elected as Secretary General.

00:08:03.792 --> 00:08:04.583
REPORTER: Of what exactly?

00:08:04.792 --> 00:08:08.125
SHRI MATAJI: Of one international organization you have,

00:08:08.375 --> 00:08:11.000
a one agency you have in this country,

00:08:11.208 --> 00:08:14.458
called as International Maritime Organization,

00:08:14.667 --> 00:08:17.792
which has got 134 nations

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.208
who have elected him. And that’s how we are here.

00:08:21.999 --> 00:08:24.000
REPORTER: Do You find… I mean, his work

00:08:24.208 --> 00:08:27.000
must be so completely different to Yours.

00:08:27.208 --> 00:08:29.583
SHRI MATAJI: No, it’s quite just the same, I feel,

00:08:29.917 --> 00:08:34.709
because My work only works out how I meet people, isn’t it?

00:08:35.125 --> 00:08:39.875
And when I meet the people, I find they like My work.

00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:42.166
I help his people also sometimes, you can say,

00:08:42.375 --> 00:08:44.041
for something wrong with them.

00:08:44.291 --> 00:08:47.166
But it never collides with My work at all, I find,

00:08:47.375 --> 00:08:49.041
because you are so…

00:08:49.291 --> 00:08:52.208
you become so loving and affectionate and so tolerant

00:08:52.417 --> 00:08:55.000
that you just don’t feel anything else.

00:08:55.250 --> 00:08:57.917
It’s very nice to meet new people because…

00:08:58.083 --> 00:09:00.792
Because of him I’ve gone to many communist countries,

00:09:00.999 --> 00:09:03.083
I visited China and visited Russia…

00:09:03.333 --> 00:09:06.333
All these places I could not have visited.

00:09:06.542 --> 00:09:09.250
REPORTER: I think, um…

00:09:09.458 --> 00:09:12.041
I mean, You must have a great deal of difficulty

00:09:12.250 --> 00:09:16.792
convincing people that You are a genuine, bona fide

00:09:16.999 --> 00:09:18.125
person, You know, it’s a little bit dangerous.

00:09:18.375 --> 00:09:20.917
Do You find that there is, um, problems with people who are

00:09:21.083 --> 00:09:22.333
extreme, sort of extreme people who are... ?

00:09:22.542 --> 00:09:24.041
SHRI MATAJI: You see, it depends on what country you are.

00:09:24.250 --> 00:09:26.959
Say, in India it’s not difficult at all, because they understand this,

00:09:27.125 --> 00:09:29.083
They know, they have had an education on this,

00:09:29.291 --> 00:09:31.875
that the one who awakens the Kundalini is the real person.

00:09:32.041 --> 00:09:33.999
You see, they can see the rising of the Kundalini,

00:09:34.166 --> 00:09:36.375
they can see the pulsation of the Kundalini,

00:09:36.583 --> 00:09:37.709
they can feel the pulsation here.

00:09:37.917 --> 00:09:40.041
It’s all told them, so they know about it.

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:42.583
I don’t have to work out with them.

00:09:42.792 --> 00:09:44.959
But if otherwise the…

00:09:45.166 --> 00:09:48.458
most of the seekers in other countries also have

00:09:48.667 --> 00:09:52.000
come to right conclusions, because they have had a very bad time.

00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:55.583
So they have come to right conclusions, I mean it’s not so difficult.

00:09:55.792 --> 00:09:56.917
But of course, you know,

00:09:57.083 --> 00:10:00.250
that if there’s too much mental projection, then rather difficult.

00:10:00.458 --> 00:10:01.375
But it doesn’t matter.

00:10:01.583 --> 00:10:03.792
REPORTER: Are there fakes in this country?

00:10:03.999 --> 00:10:05.583
SHRI MATAJI: So many. Most of them are.

00:10:05.792 --> 00:10:07.208
REPORTER: I mean, they must be Your biggest headache,

00:10:07.417 --> 00:10:08.750
I should think, maybe.

00:10:08.959 --> 00:10:11.083
SHRI MATAJI: They are not only Mine but of all the seekers.

00:10:11.417 --> 00:10:13.959
And that’s very true.

00:10:14.125 --> 00:10:17.375
They really ruin seekers. I’ve known people, they make money,

00:10:17.792 --> 00:10:21.041
put these people out of jobs, out of their lives,

00:10:21.250 --> 00:10:24.750
make them abnormal, sick like cabbages,

00:10:25.500 --> 00:10:30.125
they take away… the children are ruined…it's horrible.

00:10:30.333 --> 00:10:33.500
Some of them get epilepsy, some of them get cancer…

00:10:33.709 --> 00:10:36.542
all kinds of diseases. Some people become blind.

00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:37.625
They all punish them-

00:10:37.834 --> 00:10:39.291
REPORTER: You don’t in fact charge anything, do You?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.458
SHRI MATAJI: No no no. No no.

00:10:40.667 --> 00:10:43.792
REPORTER: Then how is, Your trips round the country,

00:10:43.999 --> 00:10:46.000
to different countries and around Britain and so on,

00:10:46.208 --> 00:10:47.291
how are they actually funded then?

00:10:47.500 --> 00:10:49.709
SHRI MATAJI: You see, it is mostly funded by My husband.

00:10:50.166 --> 00:10:51.208
Mostly he’s a generous man.

00:10:51.417 --> 00:10:53.458
REPORTER: That’s lucky, isn’t it!

00:10:53.667 --> 00:10:54.583
SHRI MATAJI: He’s generous.

00:10:54.792 --> 00:11:00.000
Otherwise also I have My some income of My own.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.875
REPORTER: How much would You estimate

00:11:02.041 --> 00:11:04.959
that You spend trying to spread the word, a year?

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.792
SHRI MATAJI: Well, I can't say that, I’m not good at accounting,

00:11:09.041 --> 00:11:10.625
but I would say that when I travel,

00:11:10.792 --> 00:11:12.999
for example, supposing I go to any other country,

00:11:13.166 --> 00:11:15.417
sometimes Sahaja Yogis think that I should not pay

00:11:15.625 --> 00:11:17.333
for their salvation, you see.

00:11:17.542 --> 00:11:20.417
So out of their self-respect they pay My traveling sometimes,

00:11:20.625 --> 00:11:23.875
but they don’t pay Me but to the travel agency or something they,

00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:26.291
buy tickets for Me at the most, that’s all.

00:11:26.542 --> 00:11:28.875
But not much, it’s not much per year.

00:11:29.041 --> 00:11:31.208
REPORTER: Where have You traveled this year?

00:11:31.458 --> 00:11:33.291
SHRI MATAJI: Now, this year, let’s start.

00:11:33.542 --> 00:11:38.125
When… where did I go, can you…?

00:11:38.667 --> 00:11:43.709
Now, I came from America…

00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:46.875
Geneva, Austria, Belgium,

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:50.959
Spain, Portugal, France,

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:54.999
Germany… Russia, I went to Russia, Uzbekistan.

00:11:55.166 --> 00:11:55.959
REPORTER: And this is all this year, is it?

00:11:56.125 --> 00:11:58.625
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, this year, yes... REPORTER: You must be worn out.

00:11:58.834 --> 00:12:01.959
SHRI MATAJI: Do I look that? Now I’m sixty. I’m sixty now.

00:12:02.125 --> 00:12:03.625
REPORTER: Really? SHRI MATAJI: Yes, I'm sixty years of age, really.

00:12:03.792 --> 00:12:06.375
REPORTER: You don’t look sixty years old at all.

00:12:06.583 --> 00:12:07.999
REPORTER: How did it all start for You then,

00:12:08.166 --> 00:12:09.625
I mean, right at the beginning?

00:12:09.834 --> 00:12:11.792
Well, say, I mean, most people know very little

00:12:11.999 --> 00:12:13.542
about this sort of thing, me included.

00:12:13.750 --> 00:12:16.834
But how did that actually all start in the beginning for You?

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.709
SHRI MATAJI: You see, actually I was aware of it

00:12:18.917 --> 00:12:21.250
from My very childhood, as you are aware, say, for example,

00:12:21.458 --> 00:12:23.917
you are aware you are a human being. In the same way I was aware.

00:12:24.083 --> 00:12:26.542
I was absolutely aware of Me, and My mission,

00:12:26.750 --> 00:12:29.709
and what I… why I’m here, what I am.

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:33.333
Everything  I was aware of from My very childhood.

00:12:33.542 --> 00:12:39.208
But I was working out how to do it in en masse happening.

00:12:39.417 --> 00:12:41.667
It would be for the masses.

00:12:41.875 --> 00:12:43.583
My father himself was a realized soul

00:12:43.792 --> 00:12:47.041
and he was a member of the Parliament and Assembly in those days,

00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:49.709
and he was the only Indian to be elected.

00:12:49.959 --> 00:12:52.250
Indian Christian to be elected, I should say.

00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:57.125
My brother also is a Minister of… what is he Minister of?

00:12:57.333 --> 00:12:59.500
Communications and something else.

00:12:59.709 --> 00:13:01.041
REPORTER: So, I mean, I suppose in India,

00:13:01.250 --> 00:13:04.083
I mean, that it’s not as difficult to actually, um

00:13:04.291 --> 00:13:06.000
... to make people understand.

00:13:06.208 --> 00:13:09.333
It’s only when You start traveling abroad?

00:13:09.542 --> 00:13:11.542
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, Indians understand much better.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.750
REPORTER: That’s what I was saying.

00:13:12.959 --> 00:13:15.333
SHRI MATAJI: But abroad is the problem. Because, you see, they…

00:13:15.542 --> 00:13:17.500
they are naive, they don’t know.

00:13:17.709 --> 00:13:19.542
You see, Christ’s life was only for four years.

00:13:19.750 --> 00:13:22.333
He couldn’t tell them much about it; about the Holy Ghost.

00:13:22.542 --> 00:13:23.834
It’s all a mystery, you see.

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.500
The Christianity could not give that, because they never went

00:13:26.709 --> 00:13:29.208
into the search of it, you see, the deeper of it.

00:13:29.458 --> 00:13:32.458
Just reading Bible, telling some sort of an interpretation

00:13:32.667 --> 00:13:33.834
doesn’t give you anything.

00:13:34.083 --> 00:13:36.959
So the second birth part of it they didn’t work out.

00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:39.959
And that’s why I find people got lost more,

00:13:40.125 --> 00:13:45.041
because of these gurus coming, giving them some ideas, this, that…

00:13:45.250 --> 00:13:48.125
And they sort of are hypnotized also to a great extent.

00:13:48.333 --> 00:13:50.166
All these people are hypnotized, brainwashed,

00:13:50.375 --> 00:13:52.709
then they, some of them went into drugs.

00:13:52.917 --> 00:13:56.625
You see, so many things, they are all self-destroying.

00:13:56.875 --> 00:14:00.375
That’s how I found people very much confused, very much confused.

00:14:00.625 --> 00:14:02.500
Of course, the people in India

00:14:02.709 --> 00:14:04.875
say, for example, of this entrepreneur,

00:14:05.041 --> 00:14:07.208
He knows I am a saint.

00:14:07.417 --> 00:14:09.458
So he treats Me like a saint, it’s a very big thing,

00:14:09.667 --> 00:14:11.333
and then he'll come to receive Me and…

00:14:11.542 --> 00:14:13.250
that even the Prime Minister of India,

00:14:13.458 --> 00:14:15.792
Mr. Lal Bahadur Shastri,  My husband was his secretary,

00:14:15.999 --> 00:14:19.375
but he used to come and see Me often, in the car, you see.

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:22.458
So in India it’s a… saint is higher than all kings

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:24.417
and everyone put together, you see.

00:14:24.625 --> 00:14:28.333
So they know how to respect a saint, even for popularity.

00:14:28.583 --> 00:14:31.917
REPORTER: Do You find that, I mean… to call Yourself a saint…

00:14:32.083 --> 00:14:34.792
do You find that the people in England…

00:14:34.999 --> 00:14:35.917
SHRI MATAJI: They are not so much.

00:14:36.083 --> 00:14:38.125
REPORTER: You know, they're not…they're not quite as keen…

00:14:38.333 --> 00:14:40.542
SHRI MATAJI: (unclear...) the saints, I think.

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:43.208
No, they care more for politicians.

00:14:43.417 --> 00:14:43.999
REPORTER: That’s right, that’s right.

00:14:44.166 --> 00:14:45.583
I mean, do You find, You know, sort of…

00:14:45.792 --> 00:14:48.542
I mean, You are little bit insulted by them sometimes?

00:14:48.792 --> 00:14:49.834
SHRI MATAJI: Aah, it’s all right.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:52.750
REPORTER: I mean, You firmly believe in what You do, obviously, and

00:14:52.959 --> 00:14:55.792
it must seem incredible to You when other people [ignore?] it.

00:14:55.999 --> 00:14:58.417
SHRI MATAJI: It’s all right. You see, after all they are children,

00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:01.458
they don’t understand. That’s all I can say.

00:15:01.667 --> 00:15:04.709
Because they are still children in spiritual life, you see.

00:15:04.917 --> 00:15:07.625
But they are not going to crucify Me this time, isn’t it?

00:15:07.875 --> 00:15:09.250
So it’s all right.

00:15:09.458 --> 00:15:11.208
REPORTER: Now, when You make these trips

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:13.500
to towns like Northampton and so on,

00:15:13.709 --> 00:15:15.500
You got several people with You.

00:15:15.709 --> 00:15:18.041
Does this team come with You every time?

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.625
SHRI MATAJI: No, they are from this place, some of them are now

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:23.999
and some of them are there also. Of course all the others

00:15:24.166 --> 00:15:26.000
they have come from Australia.

00:15:26.208 --> 00:15:29.291
And we have an ashram in South London.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.291
So they are staying there, so they just came around here.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:34.417
And these two are from -

00:15:34.625 --> 00:15:37.667
he’s working in London, he is also there.

00:15:37.875 --> 00:15:41.917
And these three gentlemen are from Bedford. He is from Bristol.

00:15:42.083 --> 00:15:44.291
REPORTER: Oh I see. SHRI MATAJI: But there is nothing like that,

00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:46.000
is that a team or anything.

00:15:46.333 --> 00:15:49.083
Anybody who feels like can come around if they’re free, because…

00:15:49.291 --> 00:15:50.750
REPORTER: So anyone who is available for You, to help…

00:15:50.959 --> 00:15:52.750
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, they can just to help Me,

00:15:52.959 --> 00:15:55.542
because if it’s a big group and all that, so they can help Me.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.875
REPORTER: I see, all right, I see.

00:15:57.041 --> 00:15:58.542
Well, thanks very much for Your time.

00:15:58.750 --> 00:16:01.250
SHRI MATAJI: Thank you very much. But I think you should ask

00:16:01.458 --> 00:16:04.083
one more question if you can, say, about Kundalini,

00:16:04.291 --> 00:16:05.625
because those who have read about Kundalini

00:16:05.834 --> 00:16:07.125
would be interested to know.

00:16:07.333 --> 00:16:09.750
Is that, is said that, you see, lots of books

00:16:09.959 --> 00:16:11.417
have been written about Kundalini,

00:16:11.625 --> 00:16:14.542
that it’s very dangerous, it is very (this thing?), and all that.

00:16:14.750 --> 00:16:16.208
But it is not at all.

00:16:16.417 --> 00:16:19.542
You see, thousands of people I’ve given realization. Thousands.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:23.250
It has never put anybody into danger at all.

00:16:23.458 --> 00:16:27.542
But those who are naïve, those who are unholy persons,

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:30.291
who have no idea of a spiritual life, you see,

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:32.291
if they try tricks, you see,

00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:35.583
like sex, you see, through sex and all that nonsense,

00:16:35.792 --> 00:16:39.667
then it feels insulted, and then there are problems.

00:16:39.875 --> 00:16:41.667
REPORTER: How can it be dangerous then?

00:16:41.875 --> 00:16:43.709
SHRI MATAJI: Beg your pardon? REPORTER: How, You said, it can be dangerous

00:16:43.917 --> 00:16:45.250
if it's not used properly?

00:16:45.458 --> 00:16:46.875
SHRI MATAJI: You see, like we could say that

00:16:47.041 --> 00:16:50.250
if I don’t know this instrument and I put My hand into something,

00:16:50.458 --> 00:16:52.917
I may get a burning, but it doesn’t mean this is dangerous,

00:16:53.083 --> 00:16:54.291
that is because I don’t know how to work it…

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.959
REPORTER:That is basic, I mean, if you don’t understand it's

00:16:56.125 --> 00:16:57.917
like putting your finger in an electric light socket...…

00:16:58.083 --> 00:17:02.125
SHRI MATAJI: That’s what, you see. That’s like that, you see.

00:17:02.333 --> 00:17:03.333
But they try to do it

00:17:03.542 --> 00:17:05.417
and then they try to write books about it.

00:17:05.625 --> 00:17:07.125
It’s something surprising, isn’t it?

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:11.291
I haven’t written any book so far.

00:17:11.959 --> 00:17:14.083
REPORTER: So, that’s obviously, You know,

00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:16.542
sort of the thing you've got to try and make clear to people.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:18.709
SHRI MATAJI: Yes, you have to. And then, you see,

00:17:18.917 --> 00:17:21.834
when you get realization, you automatically become righteous,

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.417
I don’t have to tell you “Become righteous.”

00:17:23.625 --> 00:17:25.709
Because the religion is enlightened within you.

00:17:25.917 --> 00:17:28.166
You automatically become. I don’t tell you that “You don’t drink,”

00:17:28.375 --> 00:17:30.417
you just don’t drink, because you don’t enjoy it any more.

00:17:30.625 --> 00:17:33.417
You don’t smoke, because you just don’t enjoy it; don’t take drugs.

00:17:33.625 --> 00:17:35.500
Just you just don’t do it because it’s all enlightened,

00:17:35.709 --> 00:17:37.625
because a new priority has come.

00:17:37.834 --> 00:17:40.583
Like if there’s light in this room, suddenly you start seeing

00:17:40.792 --> 00:17:42.166
where’s the position of everything,

00:17:42.375 --> 00:17:44.125
and you know, if you walk this way, you’ll be hit.

00:17:44.333 --> 00:17:46.500
In the same way, enlightenment means that

00:17:46.709 --> 00:17:48.333
automatically you become righteous.

00:17:48.583 --> 00:17:51.041
REPORTER: What is Your success rate in full for healing people?

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:52.875
SHRI MATAJI: What is?… REPORTER: What is Your success rate

00:17:53.041 --> 00:17:54.583
for healing people who come to see You?

00:17:54.792 --> 00:17:56.291
SHRI MATAJI: Success? REPORTER: Successful or have helped them.

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.500
REPORTER: How many times do You actually heal people

00:17:58.709 --> 00:17:59.667
compared to the number of people who come to see You?

00:17:59.875 --> 00:18:02.792
SHRI MATAJI: Oh, some people just come, for ten minutes is sufficient.

00:18:02.999 --> 00:18:06.417
Our president Sanjiva Reddy, the first president,

00:18:06.625 --> 00:18:09.083
he was coming from England… America.

00:18:09.291 --> 00:18:12.750
His operation had failed, he was just in a very bad shape.

00:18:12.959 --> 00:18:14.166
I just went to see him

00:18:14.417 --> 00:18:19.000
and he didn’t know I was Mataji, but he knew Me as Mrs. Shrivastav.

00:18:19.250 --> 00:18:21.542
And suddenly our High Commissioner told him,

00:18:21.750 --> 00:18:23.417
“This is Mataji Nirmala Devi.”

00:18:23.625 --> 00:18:26.583
So his wife said, “I’ve heard You have cured so many people,

00:18:26.792 --> 00:18:28.041
so just cure my husband.”

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.583
I put My hand only for ten minutes, you’ll be surprised.

00:18:30.792 --> 00:18:32.041
He was just, then — he got it.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:33.875
REPORTER: This can happen every time

00:18:34.041 --> 00:18:36.166
when You get somebody come to see You?

00:18:36.375 --> 00:18:38.458
SHRI MATAJI: Not always. Some people take more time,

00:18:38.667 --> 00:18:39.959
some people take less time.

00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:42.709
It depends on if they are complicated,

00:18:42.917 --> 00:18:46.750
you see, they take more time, some of them do.

00:18:46.959 --> 00:18:49.583
You see, for example, supposing I have to break through, now.

00:18:49.792 --> 00:18:52.333
And if you are just there, you will out.

00:18:52.542 --> 00:18:55.041
REPORTER: Are there some people You just simply can’t heal?

00:18:55.250 --> 00:19:00.375
SHRI MATAJI: Some people… I don’t know, but, you see…

00:19:00.625 --> 00:19:02.125
I don’t know, I don’t remember of someone

00:19:02.333 --> 00:19:06.125
who came to Me and was not healed so far.

00:19:06.333 --> 00:19:08.041
Some might have been, I don’t know.

00:19:08.250 --> 00:19:11.917
But those who came, you see, assiduously —

00:19:12.083 --> 00:19:15.667
I don’t think, isn’t it?

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:17.917
As far as I remember, I should say.

00:19:18.083 --> 00:19:20.166
REPORTER: Yeah, You've done quite a lot.

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:22.000
SHRI MATAJI: You see, there are so many I have, it has happened,

00:19:22.208 --> 00:19:23.792
even these people are healing, you see.

00:19:23.999 --> 00:19:25.875
So there’s no end to it. Imagine,

00:19:26.041 --> 00:19:28.667
one person is Me, I can remember for Myself,

00:19:28.875 --> 00:19:30.458
but there are so many they are healing, and

00:19:30.667 --> 00:19:32.959
I just forget about it, I just don’t remember.

00:19:33.125 --> 00:19:35.709
Once I had gone to a program, I was just sitting.

00:19:35.917 --> 00:19:38.000
One gentleman came, he just touched My feet.

00:19:38.208 --> 00:19:40.125
I said, “Who are you?” He said, “You forgot me?”

00:19:40.333 --> 00:19:42.750
I said, “Why?” I said, “I’m sorry.”

00:19:42.959 --> 00:19:45.041
He said, “I’m the father of such and such girl,

00:19:45.250 --> 00:19:46.917
whom You cured in two minutes time,

00:19:47.083 --> 00:19:49.166
who was going to die, and this and that in the hospital.”

00:19:49.375 --> 00:19:50.667
I said, “Really?”

00:19:50.875 --> 00:19:53.834
I tried to remember, I said, “Who was this?” you see.

00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.333
Then with very great difficulty I remembered,

00:19:56.542 --> 00:19:58.125
because it was so quick.

00:19:58.333 --> 00:19:59.542
I had gone to see somebody else

00:19:59.750 --> 00:20:01.583
and on My way back he caught hold of Me.

00:20:01.875 --> 00:20:04.083
And there she was. She was cured in such a quick manner

00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:06.750
that I'd forgotten all about it. REPORTER: Really?

00:20:06.959 --> 00:20:09.959
Well, I suppose, the proof is in the pudding, isn’t it?

00:20:10.125 --> 00:20:12.000
SHRI MATAJI: Yes. And moreover, what I’m saying

00:20:12.208 --> 00:20:15.250
it is not important. What is important is to become Spirit.

00:20:15.458 --> 00:20:17.625
Healing is not important.

00:20:17.834 --> 00:20:21.166
You see, because everyone has to die in any case, isn’t it?

00:20:21.375 --> 00:20:25.166
What is important  that you have to become the Spirit.

00:20:26.792 --> 00:20:28.792
That is. And then you heal others.

00:20:28.999 --> 00:20:32.375
Not only yourself, you can heal yourself and heal others also.

00:20:32.583 --> 00:20:34.625
REPORTER: All right, very good... Well, as I say,

00:20:34.792 --> 00:20:36.333
thank You, thank You for Your time.

00:20:36.542 --> 00:20:38.417
SHRI MATAJI: Many incurable diseases you can put,

00:20:38.625 --> 00:20:40.083
but that’s not the main job, I think.

00:20:40.291 --> 00:20:41.917
REPORTER: Yes. I think that’s probably the thing

00:20:42.083 --> 00:20:45.375
that a lot of people are most interested in.

00:20:45.583 --> 00:20:48.667
SHRI MATAJI: I agree, yes. YOGI: Excuse me, Mother.

00:20:48.875 --> 00:20:52.792
When you asked me[UNCLEAR] in Paris, and Mother took it very well,

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:54.709
but they described Her as a man.

00:20:54.917 --> 00:20:57.500
[YOGINI SPEAKING]

00:20:57.750 --> 00:20:59.208
SHRI MATAJI: What is she…

00:20:59.417 --> 00:21:00.667
REPORTER: I think you are speaking to the wrong person.

00:21:00.875 --> 00:21:01.959
YOGI: I’m getting confused.

00:21:02.125 --> 00:21:03.291
SHRI MATAJI: What is it? What is it?

00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:15.542
[YOGINI SPEAKING]

00:21:15.875 --> 00:21:17.625
SHRI MATAJI: Yeah. REPORTER: This is in fact…

00:21:17.834 --> 00:21:19.792
[YOGINI SPEAKING]

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.166
SHRI MATAJI: Ah, I remember that.

00:21:21.375 --> 00:21:24.000
And he also said I’m a He, you see, put My photograph.

00:21:24.208 --> 00:21:26.875
And they referred to Me as a He, you see, [UNCLEAR].

00:21:27.041 --> 00:21:30.959
REPORTER: In fact, this would be the first article we've ever run on You, so....

00:21:31.125 --> 00:21:32.250
(Yogi apologizing)SHRI MATAJI: This is [unclear].

00:21:32.458 --> 00:21:34.500
REPORTER: That’s all right, that’s all right.

00:21:34.709 --> 00:21:35.917
It often happens, actually.

00:21:36.083 --> 00:21:37.166
SHRI MATAJI: It happens. I’ve seen, there have been

00:21:37.375 --> 00:21:40.125
so many things - like Me, also, as you said, I am just…

00:21:40.333 --> 00:21:43.917
sometimes I don’t remember all… REPORTER: That’s right.

00:21:44.125 --> 00:21:46.375
SHRI MATAJI: All right. So…

00:21:46.583 --> 00:21:47.750
REPORTER: Can I take just two more pictures?

00:21:47.959 --> 00:21:49.458
SHRI MATAJI: Yes yes, please, please go ahead.

00:21:49.667 --> 00:21:51.542
PHOTOGRAPHER: Actually, if You could close Your hands,

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.250
so… You know, which is normally…do you mind if I move this?

00:22:03.250 --> 00:22:07.166
SHRI MATAJI: As you say. REPORTER: Sometimes a problem.

00:22:07.792 --> 00:22:11.208
SHRI MATAJI: Our style is like this. Is this all right?

00:22:46.375 --> 00:22:47.625
SHRI MATAJI: You can ask

00:22:47.834 --> 00:22:49.709
to put their hands towards My photograph also.

00:22:49.917 --> 00:22:51.709
My photograph has vibrations.

00:22:51.959 --> 00:22:54.458
You see, they have got realization from My photograph.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:56.375
Yes, really, they have been cured from My photograph.

00:22:56.583 --> 00:22:58.417
REPORTER: That’s incredible, isn’t it? SHRI MATAJI: Yes, that's it,

00:22:58.625 --> 00:23:00.000
That’s what I was speaking, it's going to help,

00:23:00.208 --> 00:23:01.500
Sahaj is going to help all of them.

00:23:01.709 --> 00:23:03.834
REPORTER: So the more of them we get, a thousand more pictures we have…

00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:06.125

And first time I went to Australia,

00:23:24.125 --> 00:23:26.792
And a lady, one of the Sahaja Yoginis,

00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.041

but the patient (unclear, was perfectly all right?)

00:23:39.208 --> 00:23:41.458
And that’s how they gave it and that’s how

the photograph [works out? unclear].

00:23:43.917 --> 00:23:47.125
One of them, you see, is another journalist who is a realized soul.

REPORTER: [unclear] SHRI MATAJI: Isn’t it?

After all, newspaper should give some good news also.

00:25:09.542 --> 00:25:14.125
All right? Now, thank you for the cameraman.
