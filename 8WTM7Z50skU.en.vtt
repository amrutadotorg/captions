Eyes are very important
and play a very big part in this Swadishthana movement.

00:15.980 --> 00:19.877
Now, those
people who move their eyes too much here and there.

00:19.998 --> 00:22.567
You see, I don’t know, this is the modern style also,

00:22.687 --> 00:26.473
too much to move, everything they must see…
like that they are going on, mad people.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.388
I don’t know what is there to see like that, you see.

00:28.508 --> 00:33.880
Actually, in former days, when we were young, we
were told to see the Mother Earth all the time,

00:34.000 --> 00:36.270
not to raise your eyes higher than that.

00:36.391 --> 00:39.499
The reason is the Mother Earth soothes your eyes.

00:39.626 --> 00:45.389
But if you want moving your eyes too much,
the attention is moving, wobbling, all the time.

00:45.509 --> 00:49.331
Now the attention is sustained by liver.

00:49.451 --> 00:53.037
If your liver is not all right,
your attention cannot be all right.

00:53.157 --> 00:57.610
So those people who have a habit you
see – sometimes they’ll see through the back of their eyes,

00:57.737 --> 01:01.950
or from here – there – they
think they are doing something great by doing these things –

01:02.077 --> 01:04.775
such people can never have good livers.

01:04.895 --> 01:09.652
So to keep a good liver, keep your eyes down.
Don’t give them too much work.

01:09.773 --> 01:16.352
We are giving too much work to our eyes and that’s how
it is keeping our attention all the time wobbled out,

01:16.472 --> 01:21.191
and if your attention is out, then you can never feel happy.

01:21.311 --> 01:23.725
So the liver sustains the attention

01:23.845 --> 01:30.084
and for you to be best Sahaja yogi is to
put your eyes down, on the Mother Earth.

01:30.205 --> 01:34.878
Walk with less raising of your eyes. Respect your eyes.

01:34.998 --> 01:38.684
You’re not to waste
your eyes on all the time anybody coming up your…

01:38.804 --> 01:44.081
I’ve seen even in meditation people
can’t keep their eyes straight.

01:44.201 --> 01:51.534
You have to keep your eyes all the time in a mood
that you’re enjoying yourself, and not enjoying others.

01:51.654 --> 01:54.467
But just enjoying yourself, you cannot enjoy others,

01:54.587 --> 01:58.780
you have to enjoy yourself,
to enjoy somebody else’s vibrations.

01:58.900 --> 02:03.974
You can only enjoy others through their vibrations,
not through their seeing.

02:04.094 --> 02:09.969
And because of this, once you have this kind
of a habit, then your liver always gets into it.

02:10.089 --> 02:14.249
Then you curse yourself, you do all kinds of things…
that’s no good.

02:14.369 --> 02:18.679
Just tell yourself, “Hold my eyes on the Mother Earth.”

02:18.805 --> 02:23.294
She sustains, She takes away all your problems and everything.
