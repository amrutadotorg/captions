00:06:57.170 --> 00:07:03.148
Today is the sixth day of Navaratri.

00:07:13.286 --> 00:07:17.779
There have been many incarnations
of the Goddess

00:07:17.804 --> 00:07:22.124
for different, different purposes.

00:07:26.375 --> 00:07:35.245
But when the great saints
introspect themselves,

00:07:35.270 --> 00:07:38.786
who were worshipping the Mother,

00:07:38.819 --> 00:07:49.209
they found out that what
She has done for us.

00:07:50.371 --> 00:07:53.811
The other day I told you
the dharma

00:07:53.836 --> 00:08:01.381
is the innate valency of human beings.
And they are ten.

00:08:01.406 --> 00:08:08.260
This is already established within us,
but we deviate,

00:08:08.285 --> 00:08:13.284
deviate from dharma and all
the problems come in,

00:08:13.309 --> 00:08:20.620
because to leave the dharma
is not a human quality.

00:08:22.236 --> 00:08:29.661
But Goddess Herself has done so many
things for us already, within us,

00:08:29.686 --> 00:08:33.410
though we are not aware of it.

00:08:34.019 --> 00:08:39.303
It is said that “ya Devi sarva
bhuteshu” -

00:08:39.328 --> 00:08:44.486
"all those whom You have created",
- means mostly the human beings -

00:08:44.511 --> 00:08:51.934
"What do You do? As what do You exist
inside the human beings? ”.

00:08:54.333 --> 00:09:00.823
Now, just introspect if you have
these qualities within you or not,

00:09:00.864 --> 00:09:10.387
because they are given to you by
the Goddess, by the Shakti within you.

00:09:13.117 --> 00:09:20.673
Like: ”Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
shanti rupena samstitha”.

00:09:20.698 --> 00:09:28.487
is very important, that You exist
within the human beings as peace.

00:09:28.512 --> 00:09:35.325
Do you find thus human beings
who are peaceful within and without?

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:40.196
Very difficult. But She has given
you that,

00:09:40.221 --> 00:09:44.973
She has given you that peace
which you have to achieve.

00:09:44.998 --> 00:09:52.268
Now it comes, because you have fallen
off your human dharmas.

00:09:52.293 --> 00:09:56.617
So this peace that She has given you,
you have to achieve

00:09:56.642 --> 00:10:02.573
through your ascent, through
the Kundalini awakening.

00:10:02.598 --> 00:10:12.641
You are excited, all right.
Or, you want to take revenge,

00:10:12.666 --> 00:10:19.790
you want to hurt others,
you want to trouble others;

00:10:19.815 --> 00:10:24.067
you enjoy sometimes,
even as sahaja yogis

00:10:24.092 --> 00:10:30.734
people enjoy hurting others,
troubling others.

00:10:30.759 --> 00:10:34.744
So, the second one She says is:

00:10:34.769 --> 00:10:41.756
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
pritti rupena samsthita”.

00:10:41.781 --> 00:10:46.170
Pritti  is the quality of loving,

00:10:46.195 --> 00:10:54.040
that a human being has been given
the quality of loving.

00:10:54.065 --> 00:10:57.270
But, it’s not there.

00:10:57.295 --> 00:11:04.326
Because first nonsensical thing
human beings have is jealousy.

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:11.097
Now, supposing I give some present
to somebody,

00:11:11.122 --> 00:11:13.748
and some present to another one.

00:11:13.773 --> 00:11:19.460
Even in Sahaja Yoga they feel
jealous. Very surprising.

00:11:19.485 --> 00:11:25.345
How can you, when the Goddess
has given you the quality to love?

00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:34.187
Very, very common nonsense about it
is that human beings are very jealous.

00:11:34.212 --> 00:11:37.947
But as sahaja yogis you should
not do,

00:11:37.972 --> 00:11:43.281
because that quality that the Goddess
has given you is of loving.

00:11:43.306 --> 00:11:47.264
That quality should be shown -
on the contrary you are very jealous.

00:11:47.289 --> 00:11:52.841
That means you are not a sahaja yogi,
blessed by Shri Mataji - no.

00:11:52.866 --> 00:11:57.502
If you are blessed, then you will have
no jealousy whatsoever.

00:11:57.527 --> 00:12:02.551
And this jealousy sometimes it goes
to this extent that

00:12:02.576 --> 00:12:11.850
"Now, we are, say, from Cabella,
so you are from Albera. Finished!"

00:12:11.875 --> 00:12:16.432
These so close to each other.

00:12:16.457 --> 00:12:24.183
Just like the two nostrils together.
But there will be jealousy.

00:12:24.208 --> 00:12:28.653
There will be jealousy about,
”Why not Mother come to my country,

00:12:28.678 --> 00:12:32.522
if You can go to that country”.

00:12:32.547 --> 00:12:35.842
So this comes also from the ignorance
that

00:12:35.867 --> 00:12:41.772
“This is mine, this is mine,
this is yours”.

00:12:42.637 --> 00:12:51.934
This jealousy starts in such a funny
manner that we do not realize also

00:12:51.959 --> 00:13:00.929
that She has given us the power to love.
Tremendous power to love.

00:13:02.735 --> 00:13:07.089
Inauspicious power, our cannot be.

00:13:07.114 --> 00:13:12.609
But auspicious, dharmic power
to love somebody.

00:13:12.634 --> 00:13:20.189
Means without any lust and greed,
without any jealousy.

00:13:20.214 --> 00:13:24.718
But the human mind has developed
itself so cunning

00:13:24.743 --> 00:13:29.895
that it is proud that it can be
jealous of someone.

00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:35.238
Out of this jealousy only greed
comes in, as I told you.

00:13:35.263 --> 00:13:40.989
Is a fact, because you feel jealous
- so you want to buy the same thing.

00:13:41.014 --> 00:13:44.156
Then you must compete with others.

00:13:44.181 --> 00:13:50.627
If somebody has got a job better than
yours, then you must compete with him.

00:13:52.381 --> 00:13:58.831
These things are all destructive and
the powers of Goddess are constructive.

00:13:58.856 --> 00:14:07.285
She gives you all the powers
that are absolutely constructive.

00:14:07.310 --> 00:14:13.111
Then She says, “Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu”,
the saints have said it,

00:14:13.136 --> 00:14:16.618
- "kshama rupena samsthita”.

00:14:16.643 --> 00:14:23.177
Kshama is what you call
is the forgiveness.

00:14:23.202 --> 00:14:27.033
Forgiveness from the heart.

00:14:27.058 --> 00:14:32.397
All right, somebody has been cruel
to you, has been nasty to you,

00:14:32.422 --> 00:14:35.379
has exploited you, has troubled you,

00:14:35.404 --> 00:14:41.256
but you have the power, greater power
to forgive.

00:14:41.281 --> 00:14:46.909
Do we use that power to forgive?

00:14:50.777 --> 00:14:58.341
Then for relaxing also, what does
She do, that She gives you the sleep.

00:14:58.366 --> 00:15:03.557
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
nidra rupena samsthita”.

00:15:03.582 --> 00:15:08.557
When you are tired and you
can’t sleep

00:15:08.582 --> 00:15:14.999
She makes you sleep. She relaxes you.
So the power of relaxation She does

00:15:15.024 --> 00:15:19.209
because She acts through parasympathetic
nervous system.

00:15:19.234 --> 00:15:24.084
The sympathetic nervous system
can excite you, can depress you.

00:15:24.109 --> 00:15:30.030
But the parasympathetic relaxes you,
relaxes your heart,

00:15:30.055 --> 00:15:34.077
relaxes your body and completely
feel relaxed

00:15:34.102 --> 00:15:38.103
and sleeping in the lap of your Mother.

00:15:38.128 --> 00:15:42.581
But there are many people
who cannot sleep.

00:15:43.247 --> 00:15:50.594
Because they are thinking about
something they have to achieve.

00:15:50.619 --> 00:15:55.871
If you cannot sleep, then something
wrong with you.

00:15:55.896 --> 00:15:59.975
And when you cannot sleep
I also cannot sleep.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:06.929
Whatever collectively happening
also works on Me.

00:16:06.954 --> 00:16:13.608
Anything wrong you do, that works
on Me, specially collectively.

00:16:13.632 --> 00:16:21.321
So you cannot sleep because you are
thinking of things which are of no value.

00:16:21.346 --> 00:16:23.711
Now, to overcome that in Sahaja Yoga

00:16:23.736 --> 00:16:27.192
we know we have to go into
thoughtless awareness.

00:16:27.217 --> 00:16:31.493
But when your ego is working or...

00:16:31.518 --> 00:16:36.057
This child is very disturbing. I've seen
him all the time running about.

00:16:36.082 --> 00:16:41.346
Better tell him. Whose son is he?

00:16:45.504 --> 00:16:50.590
You see, in India you’ll find children
absolutely keeping quiet.

00:16:50.615 --> 00:16:58.368
Why? Because the mother takes up
the responsibility to train the child.

00:16:58.393 --> 00:17:02.143
So many programs you have had,
have you ever seen

00:17:02.168 --> 00:17:05.856
any child running about? Yesterday also
they were running about here.

00:17:05.881 --> 00:17:11.698
The reason is mother doesn’t take
responsibility as a mother

00:17:11.723 --> 00:17:16.199
to see that the children are properly
brought up.

00:17:16.224 --> 00:17:20.499
Even you are so old, but I have
to tell you.

00:17:20.524 --> 00:17:26.368
Whatever is good for you, for your
society, a new generation that has come.

00:17:26.393 --> 00:17:32.262
In this new generation if you still
are not behaving in a proper way,

00:17:32.287 --> 00:17:36.385
in abnormal way, how can you
impress others?

00:17:36.410 --> 00:17:39.957
So, Mother has to tell you.

00:17:45.144 --> 00:17:54.066
The most interesting thing that
the Mother has put in you is

00:17:54.091 --> 00:18:00.454
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
bhranti rupena samsthita”.

00:18:00.479 --> 00:18:04.274
She puts you into delusion,

00:18:04.299 --> 00:18:09.016
because sometimes the children
cannot understand

00:18:09.041 --> 00:18:15.397
unless and until they face the delusion.
They have to face the delusion.

00:18:15.422 --> 00:18:21.025
She allows, allows you to go wrong

00:18:21.050 --> 00:18:25.746
to a point where you discover
you are lost.

00:18:25.771 --> 00:18:29.007
Very important it is that She plays,

00:18:29.032 --> 00:18:32.759
this is the Mahamaya part
as they say.

00:18:32.784 --> 00:18:36.950
And this is discussed
in every religion

00:18:36.975 --> 00:18:41.819
that we get lost with this delusion.

00:18:41.844 --> 00:18:46.423
Now, what are the delusions
we have?

00:18:46.448 --> 00:18:50.353
We have the delusions
of ego.

00:18:50.378 --> 00:18:55.631
Ego for men as if they are
very powerful,

00:18:55.656 --> 00:19:02.206
that they can do what they like and they
are not going to be punished for it.

00:19:02.231 --> 00:19:06.621
For women they too behave
in the same manner.

00:19:06.646 --> 00:19:11.487
They don’t understand that
this is a delusion

00:19:11.512 --> 00:19:20.005
the Mother has given into us for us
to find out that we are in the wrong.

00:19:20.030 --> 00:19:25.152
Because if you tell somebody,
“This is wrong, you don’t do it”,

00:19:25.177 --> 00:19:30.238
still they are not matured enough
so they’ll go on doing wrong things.

00:19:30.263 --> 00:19:35.502
So the Mother says, “All right, go on.
Very nice, very good. Very good thing.

00:19:35.527 --> 00:19:39.894
You’ll jump in the sea? – Jump”.

00:19:40.384 --> 00:19:46.969
Then when you realize that you
have been in a delusion,

00:19:46.994 --> 00:19:50.057
then only you can return back.

00:19:50.082 --> 00:19:54.391
Otherwise without any problem
you cannot return.

00:19:54.416 --> 00:20:05.675
So many of you are so obstinate,
so self-conscious.

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:10.440
Whatever one may tell you,
you will not listen.

00:20:10.465 --> 00:20:17.026
Whatever way you may try to convince,
on a mental level, you won’t.

00:20:17.051 --> 00:20:23.061
So, the bhranti, the delusion,
is beyond the mind.

00:20:23.086 --> 00:20:26.384
It is beyond the mind.

00:20:26.409 --> 00:20:33.417
It works out sometimes very well
for difficult people.

00:20:33.793 --> 00:20:41.069
Now, when you are in a position
of a Mother

00:20:41.094 --> 00:20:48.023
you don’t want Your child to be ruined, naturally.

00:20:48.048 --> 00:20:52.496
She feels responsible,
and She thinks that:

00:20:52.521 --> 00:20:56.554
“Now they have got connection
with the Divine,

00:20:56.579 --> 00:21:00.023
and this connection should not
be broken,

00:21:00.048 --> 00:21:05.136
that they should be all the time
blessed and be happy.

00:21:05.161 --> 00:21:08.812
All this is within us,

00:21:09.450 --> 00:21:15.158
within us, built-in, from our
very childhood,

00:21:15.183 --> 00:21:22.044
but we forget, slowly, slowly
we start losing it.

00:21:22.069 --> 00:21:27.137
Maybe the conditioning is such
or maybe the ego is such,

00:21:27.162 --> 00:21:34.870
and maybe that they forget that
they are realized souls.

00:21:34.895 --> 00:21:40.790
I’m talking to you - to people who are
realized souls. I’m not talking

00:21:40.815 --> 00:21:47.478
to people who are already lost or who
may be on their way to Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:47.503 --> 00:21:51.940
But the way you are brought up,
the way you have been told

00:21:51.965 --> 00:21:59.698
very sweetly with love, with affection,
with kindness,

00:21:59.723 --> 00:22:05.223
and if you don’t understand that,
then you go into bhranti.

00:22:05.248 --> 00:22:07.357
For example, it is also said that,

00:22:07.382 --> 00:22:14.294
“Ya Devi sarva bhuteshu
lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:22:15.111 --> 00:22:20.730
Lajja, I don’t know how to describe,
it’s not shyness.

00:22:20.755 --> 00:22:29.806
It is a kind of a shame about
your body.

00:22:31.070 --> 00:22:37.770
Now they have beauty contests. India
also they had beauty contest.

00:22:37.795 --> 00:22:42.373
Why are you writing?
What is he writing?

00:22:42.398 --> 00:22:47.565
There’s no need to write, there will be
a tape. Alright?

00:22:48.616 --> 00:22:51.782
Lajja rupena samsthita:

00:22:51.807 --> 00:22:57.974
means you have to have shame
of your body.

00:22:58.863 --> 00:23:02.641
That’s specially for women.

00:23:02.666 --> 00:23:11.297
As a child you will see, women are
very shy.

00:23:11.322 --> 00:23:14.378
See, little girls, they are
very shy.

00:23:14.403 --> 00:23:17.341
That shyness gradually disappears,

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:20.841
but in the beginning they are
even shy of Me.

00:23:20.866 --> 00:23:25.301
They come before Me, they’ll put down
their head.

00:23:25.326 --> 00:23:30.452
They’ll not even say Namaste.
Very sweet.

00:23:31.061 --> 00:23:34.431
And they don’t like people wearing
funny dresses.

00:23:34.456 --> 00:23:39.670
I remember My granddaughter once,
she saw one magazine

00:23:39.695 --> 00:23:44.551
in which there was a lady in a swimming
dress. She said, “What are you doing?

00:23:44.576 --> 00:23:49.647
Better wear your dress, otherwise
my Grandma will come and hit you hard”.

00:23:49.672 --> 00:23:54.681
To that lady was saying that; and then
she opened and saw a man’s dress

00:23:54.706 --> 00:23:59.587
with just a small, little knicker.
I don’t know why they do it.

00:23:59.612 --> 00:24:03.687
And then she said, “This one is, seems
to be absolutely shameless fellow.

00:24:03.712 --> 00:24:07.021
He is going to have a bad time now.”
And she closed it.

00:24:07.046 --> 00:24:10.705
And then she told the maidservant,
“Burn this, burn this off.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:17.590
I don’t want to see.” Such a little
girl she knew that it was wrong.

00:24:17.615 --> 00:24:24.767
But the way nowadays we are going
about with the show of our body,

00:24:24.792 --> 00:24:33.497
and sometimes I feel that all these
designers will die

00:24:33.522 --> 00:24:40.917
or will get bankrupt, because people
wear such little clothes these days.

00:24:40.942 --> 00:24:45.734
There is no space for any artist

00:24:45.759 --> 00:24:55.386
to show his work or to show his art
how he can dress you up.

00:24:55.411 --> 00:25:02.451
In Japan I asked them how - this is long
time back, now Japanese are Americans

00:25:02.476 --> 00:25:06.660
but at that time - I said, “How is it
you wear these dresses, these kimonos,

00:25:06.685 --> 00:25:14.328
done so well, very expensive and
it takes time to wear that?”.

00:25:14.763 --> 00:25:19.976
So they said that, “You see, if God
has made a beautiful body,

00:25:20.001 --> 00:25:23.627
then it is His art,

00:25:23.652 --> 00:25:31.317
and we have to make our art
decorate it.

00:25:31.342 --> 00:25:36.294
So what we do is to make our art
to decorate it.”

00:25:36.319 --> 00:25:40.553
I really liked it, because in India
same thing.

00:25:40.578 --> 00:25:44.162
If there is a lady she has
to wear a sari,

00:25:44.187 --> 00:25:47.856
which is being made very artfully,
very beautifully,

00:25:47.881 --> 00:25:54.107
just to decorate her body,
just to respect the body.

00:25:54.623 --> 00:26:00.405
But this seems to have gone
with the influence of America,

00:26:00.430 --> 00:26:04.503
I should say, which are, they are
brainless people, absolutely brainless,

00:26:04.528 --> 00:26:09.720
nothing to learn from them.
Only two-hundred-year-old people

00:26:09.745 --> 00:26:13.412
and we start behaving in their
manner,

00:26:13.437 --> 00:26:16.463
we don’t see even what is happening
to their country,

00:26:16.488 --> 00:26:21.846
what sort of people they are,
how they live, what is their idea,

00:26:21.871 --> 00:26:26.441
what is their goal in life. Every false
guru has exploited them,

00:26:26.466 --> 00:26:30.593
because they are brainless.
If they had brains

00:26:30.618 --> 00:26:33.382
they would never have accepted
them.

00:26:33.407 --> 00:26:36.464
Ha, they have brains how to run
a computer

00:26:36.489 --> 00:26:39.834
and how to run a television -
mechanical things.

00:26:39.859 --> 00:26:45.427
But as far as their own body is concerned,
they don’t know how to manage.

00:26:45.452 --> 00:26:52.238
In India they had a beauty competition
and many sensible people opposed it,

00:26:52.263 --> 00:26:57.129
because it’s like selling your body
and making money.

00:26:57.154 --> 00:27:01.577
What is the difference between
prostitution and this?

00:27:01.602 --> 00:27:08.149
If you get money by selling your body,
then it’s prostitution.

00:27:08.174 --> 00:27:11.803
You are not supposed to sell
your body.

00:27:11.828 --> 00:27:16.945
That’s not what Goddess has done
to you.

00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:22.197
But you should dress up well, different,
different occasions are there,

00:27:22.222 --> 00:27:26.111
for those occasions you have to wear
the way it is.

00:27:26.136 --> 00:27:30.196
The other day I gave a very nice
sari which is,

00:27:30.221 --> 00:27:33.672
we call as paithani to one lady
as a present.

00:27:33.697 --> 00:27:41.738
And we had a function for a book,
was inaugurated,

00:27:41.763 --> 00:27:45.650
and this lady came there. So I said,
“Why didn’t you wear a paithani?”

00:27:45.675 --> 00:27:49.748
She said, “What, there is
no wedding on.

00:27:49.773 --> 00:27:56.303
How can I wear for this function
paithani? There has to be a wedding.”

00:27:56.329 --> 00:28:01.732
Very sweet – “in the wedding
I can wear.”

00:28:01.757 --> 00:28:09.452
It is all, you see occasions, places
which are to be celebrated.

00:28:09.477 --> 00:28:12.655
Like in India, when women go
to the temple

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:16.259
or to worship the idols or anything,

00:28:16.284 --> 00:28:24.714
then they will wear all that is necessary
to face the Goddess, after all.

00:28:24.739 --> 00:28:30.424
Imagine people coming for this program
here wearing,

00:28:30.449 --> 00:28:37.660
I don’t know what they call it, but like
jute, jute clothes - like hippies,

00:28:37.685 --> 00:28:41.827
what would happen to Me? I would disappear
in thin air, I can tell you this much.

00:28:41.852 --> 00:28:44.862
So, one has to have respect
for the body.

00:28:44.887 --> 00:28:51.648
That is what She has said first -
that “Lajja rupena samsthita”.

00:28:51.673 --> 00:28:57.641
Now you might say that there are people
who are taking the bath in the river

00:28:57.666 --> 00:29:02.042
and this and that, and give
justification.

00:29:02.067 --> 00:29:06.625
But you are saints! You are
realized souls!

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:09.850
You don’t have to see those people
who are not yet realized

00:29:09.875 --> 00:29:13.303
and who are misbehaving.

00:29:13.328 --> 00:29:19.137
You must do what a saint should do.

00:29:19.591 --> 00:29:23.788
There are so many qualities that
the Goddess has given you.

00:29:23.813 --> 00:29:28.674
Another is kshudha rupena
samstitha.

00:29:28.699 --> 00:29:35.105
She’s the One who has given us hunger.
We have to eat our food.

00:29:35.130 --> 00:29:39.222
Nowadays there’s a fashion of becoming
thin or whatever you may call.

00:29:39.247 --> 00:29:42.865
And you know so many diseases
have developed.

00:29:42.890 --> 00:29:48.185
Anorexia, this thing, that thing,
because women want to eat little.

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:52.646
You can change the things
that you are eating,

00:29:52.671 --> 00:29:58.271
but it’s not the aim of life to only
look after your body.

00:29:58.296 --> 00:30:05.881
Body is not the only important thing.
What is important is your Spirit.

00:30:06.276 --> 00:30:11.002
And She is the One who gives you
the Kundalini.

00:30:11.027 --> 00:30:15.895
She is the One who give you a method
by which you’ll ascend.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:20.260
But all the time worried about
their body.

00:30:20.285 --> 00:30:26.936
This is something I can’t understand.
Specially the women who are the shakti.

00:30:26.961 --> 00:30:35.366
Then another point is that they
follow a fashion.

00:30:36.228 --> 00:30:40.303
Fashion is madness.

00:30:41.518 --> 00:30:47.845
When I was young I used to wear
My blouses like this only.

00:30:47.870 --> 00:30:50.573
But in India also fashion started.

00:30:50.598 --> 00:30:55.041
They used to increase the size
of the sleeves,

00:30:55.067 --> 00:31:01.672
then decreased the size of the sleeves,
then some went up to here.

00:31:01.697 --> 00:31:05.950
I thought, “What is this nonsense?
Why waste money like this?”.

00:31:05.975 --> 00:31:08.180
You have a particular design,

00:31:08.205 --> 00:31:12.187
and this is traditionally accepted
design, that you should have.

00:31:12.212 --> 00:31:15.884
Why do you want to go on increasing
and decreasing

00:31:15.909 --> 00:31:20.853
the size of your sleeves, according
to the fashion. “This is the fashion”.

00:31:20.878 --> 00:31:27.202
Who makes the fashion? Devi?
Devi has made the fashion?

00:31:27.227 --> 00:31:34.174
Who has made the fashion? Is these
hungry, greedy people

00:31:34.215 --> 00:31:39.199
who are befooling you. And you are
trying to follow fashions.

00:31:39.224 --> 00:31:43.713
Now, for example, I told that you must
put oil in your head,

00:31:43.738 --> 00:31:48.805
at least on Saturday put sufficient oil
and then wash your head.

00:31:48.830 --> 00:31:53.956
But you’ll not do that and then
you’ll start losing your hair.

00:31:53.981 --> 00:31:59.250
I can understand if you have no time,
you are a very busy man - but why?

00:31:59.275 --> 00:32:05.899
Why not do something where it is
needed to look after yourself also.

00:32:05.924 --> 00:32:09.571
So, you’ll look after your body
to thin down, you’ll lose your hair,

00:32:09.596 --> 00:32:12.429
eyesight will be weak, your teeth
will be falling,

00:32:12.477 --> 00:32:18.260
and you will become very soon
an old hag.

00:32:18.876 --> 00:32:24.890
Same with the men, nowadays men are
also going to beauty parlor, I’m told.

00:32:24.914 --> 00:32:28.271
Too much money I think, and stupidity
together.

00:32:28.296 --> 00:32:33.889
There is no need. If you lead
a good, healthy life

00:32:33.914 --> 00:32:37.770
- you have to exercise and meditate.

00:32:37.795 --> 00:32:42.343
If you meditate you become peaceful.

00:32:42.368 --> 00:32:47.847
With that peace, you’ll be amazed,
you’ll have so much of energy.

00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:56.255
So much energy is wasted in thinking.
And what do you think?

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.668
If you ask somebody: “What are you
thinking?”

00:32:59.693 --> 00:33:04.277
“Everything.” But “everything”
means what?

00:33:04.302 --> 00:33:10.130
Why do you think so much?
What is the need to think?

00:33:10.155 --> 00:33:17.160
It’s a habit, human habit to go on
thinking about everything.

00:33:17.185 --> 00:33:22.462
For example, just now, there are
three carpets here.

00:33:22.487 --> 00:33:30.099
Now, if I put attention on it I’ll just
see how nice they are; I’ll just enjoy

00:33:30.124 --> 00:33:34.853
- enjoy what the artists have done,
that’s all.

00:33:34.878 --> 00:33:39.639
No words - nothing. Just the enjoyment
within yourself.

00:33:39.664 --> 00:33:43.207
But if you ask somebody else,
he’ll just start saying,

00:33:43.232 --> 00:33:45.959
“Oh, this is not good.
That’s not good.

00:33:45.984 --> 00:33:50.386
This much some price, that price,
this thing, that thing.”

00:33:50.411 --> 00:33:54.282
The joy of that artist is finished.

00:33:54.307 --> 00:34:00.303
You cannot get that joy,

00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:09.386
that joy about which we are seeking.
What we are seeking is joy,

00:34:09.411 --> 00:34:14.622
and even when you have got a way
of doing it you do not achieve it.

00:34:14.647 --> 00:34:20.500
Because thinking is a reaction,
reaction to everything,

00:34:20.525 --> 00:34:23.772
and it makes the life so miserable.

00:34:23.797 --> 00:34:28.495
It makes the life of the person who
thinks and of others also.

00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:34.308
I’ll give you an example. This whole
thing we got it done

00:34:34.333 --> 00:34:39.556
just because it’s very heavy rains
and also we have

00:34:39.581 --> 00:34:43.432
problems of sometimes snowing.

00:34:43.464 --> 00:34:46.708
So I thought that’s a nice thing
to have a nice thing done

00:34:46.733 --> 00:34:50.134
and it’s very well done, we got it.

00:34:50.159 --> 00:34:56.074
Now, there are thinking people
in this Italy. Lots of them.

00:34:56.099 --> 00:35:02.735
That’s why it’s not progressing.
Now, we applied three years back.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:08.018
Three years they kept our money
locked up in the bank, imagine.

00:35:08.043 --> 00:35:12.604
And first time they said, “All right,
everything is fine, it’s all right.

00:35:12.629 --> 00:35:18.878
You can have it.” It had seventy
signatures

00:35:18.903 --> 00:35:22.579
of these Italians, so-called.

00:35:22.604 --> 00:35:27.050
And then they came round to say,
the same people,

00:35:27.075 --> 00:35:31.689
“No, no, no, you must change it
to copper”. I said, “Why?”

00:35:31.714 --> 00:35:36.482
“Because copper will be aesthetically
very good.”

00:35:36.507 --> 00:35:40.994
But don’t they know, stupid people,
that copper will look the same

00:35:41.019 --> 00:35:48.086
as they are looking? After one month
only they will have the same colour?

00:35:48.707 --> 00:35:51.902
This is the idea of aesthetics,
and now I have told them,

00:35:51.927 --> 00:35:57.312
“We don’t want your land, you keep it
to yourself, give us back our money.”

00:35:57.337 --> 00:36:00.944
With a simple thing like that.

00:36:00.969 --> 00:36:07.903
Why? Because they have a committee,
there is “rejune, bijune, sijune”.

00:36:07.928 --> 00:36:11.114
You have to go through all that
nonsense,

00:36:11.139 --> 00:36:14.020
because they all sit down on chairs,
very seriously,

00:36:14.045 --> 00:36:17.345
“We must discuss, we must consult,
we must ask everyone,

00:36:17.370 --> 00:36:22.421
and then this and that”. And ultimately
what comes?

00:36:22.446 --> 00:36:27.322
No progress of any kind. There is
no peace.

00:36:27.347 --> 00:36:31.860
Maybe, I don’t know, maybe some
underhand dealings are needed,

00:36:31.885 --> 00:36:37.172
for which they are feeling shy to tell
Me. I don’t know what is the thing is,

00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:43.023
but still I can’t understand when
the one office says “Yes”

00:36:43.048 --> 00:36:50.744
and again, when it comes back to it,
it says “No”. Three years.

00:36:50.769 --> 00:36:58.657
So, what I am trying to say that
thinking too much is a sign of ego.

00:36:58.682 --> 00:37:04.011
But, they don’t find any solutions,
no solutions of any kind.

00:37:04.036 --> 00:37:10.320
They’ll never hit the solution. Because
they are just discussing,

00:37:10.345 --> 00:37:17.192
arguing, thinking - they have
no solutions.

00:37:23.443 --> 00:37:33.428
Now, it is important that sahaja yogis
have to do introspection,

00:37:33.453 --> 00:37:41.158
introspection - inward. Introspection
is inward-looking.

00:37:41.183 --> 00:37:45.123
Inward-looking. “Why I am thinking?
What am I thinking?

00:37:45.148 --> 00:37:48.727
What is the need to think?”.

00:37:49.478 --> 00:37:56.085
You will become Nirvichara. Don’t allow
your mind to befool you.

00:37:56.110 --> 00:38:00.333
This mind is like a monkey, I tell you,
it’s really like a monkey.

00:38:00.358 --> 00:38:04.282
And when it starts working it makes you
jump from this end to that end,

00:38:04.307 --> 00:38:09.641
that end to that end. And if you reach
some conclusions, so-called,

00:38:09.666 --> 00:38:15.681
and if it is not achieved then you are
the most miserable person.

00:38:15.706 --> 00:38:25.160
I have seen people thinning down only
thinking about something which is absurd.

00:38:25.185 --> 00:38:28.013
And you can see out of this thinking
what comes out

00:38:28.038 --> 00:38:34.660
on a global level also. What is
the need to go to the moon?

00:38:34.685 --> 00:38:38.345
So many people are starved,
are dying out.

00:38:38.370 --> 00:38:42.851
What is the need to go to Mars?

00:38:42.876 --> 00:38:47.318
What are they going to get from there?
Because they formed a habit.

00:38:47.343 --> 00:38:50.037
First they came to India, then went
to China,

00:38:50.062 --> 00:38:56.282
then went to this, then went to that;
they can’t sit down, settle down.

00:38:56.307 --> 00:39:00.429
They can’t settle down in the house
also.

00:39:00.454 --> 00:39:05.013
Specially men. If you are travelling
by train,

00:39:05.038 --> 00:39:10.061
even if the train stops for two minutes
men must get out.

00:39:10.094 --> 00:39:13.928
The wife will be worried now. And while
the train will be moving

00:39:13.953 --> 00:39:17.337
then they’ll jump in.

00:39:17.362 --> 00:39:22.598
It’s a cracked brain, I think, like a -
even why say they are like a monkey?

00:39:22.623 --> 00:39:26.667
Because monkeys won’t do that.

00:39:26.692 --> 00:39:33.682
It’s that they cannot stationary
remain in one place.

00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:38.898
Now, in meditation you have
to sit down, in one place,

00:39:38.923 --> 00:39:44.178
not to jump from here to there,
there to there. This is very difficult.

00:39:44.203 --> 00:39:49.160
Women have other problems.
While cooking they’ll meditate.

00:39:49.185 --> 00:39:51.464
They have no time!

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:55.729
They have their friends, they have
to go to shopping,

00:39:55.754 --> 00:40:00.904
to buy things and fill the house
with all kinds of rubbish.

00:40:00.929 --> 00:40:05.063
They have no time for anything.
They are also very adventurous.

00:40:05.088 --> 00:40:08.554
They want to do business, they want
to do this, they want to do that.

00:40:08.579 --> 00:40:12.001
For meditation they have no time.

00:40:12.026 --> 00:40:19.984
So, settling down is very important.
Settle down with yourself.

00:40:20.404 --> 00:40:27.515
So, once someone told Me, “Mother, if
we settle down, we’ll become very fat.”

00:40:28.988 --> 00:40:34.724
All right, doesn’t matter -
but you settle down.

00:40:35.735 --> 00:40:41.540
All sorts of excuses are there
not to meditate.

00:40:41.565 --> 00:40:48.696
“Yes, I meditate, Mother, but you know,
so difficult in these modern times.

00:40:49.371 --> 00:40:53.800
There are crises in our lives,
there are problems in our lives.”

00:40:53.825 --> 00:40:58.239
But actually you’ll be amazed, when
there’s a crisis, say, in My family

00:40:58.264 --> 00:41:02.533
or in Sahaja Yoga, immediately
I become thoughtless.

00:41:02.558 --> 00:41:04.802
Spontaneously I become thoughtless,

00:41:04.827 --> 00:41:10.785
because the problem will be solved
by the Paramchaitanya.

00:41:10.810 --> 00:41:14.953
The Paramchaitanya is going to solve
the problem, why should I think?

00:41:14.978 --> 00:41:18.102
Forget it. Let the Paramchaitanya
look after.

00:41:18.127 --> 00:41:21.116
If you don’t depend on your
Paramchaitanya,

00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:25.106
it doesn’t help you. Doesn’t give you
any solutions.

00:41:25.131 --> 00:41:33.162
Then you go on round and round and round
with your brain and work it out.

00:41:33.666 --> 00:41:39.178
This is what you have to know definitely
that you are connected

00:41:39.203 --> 00:41:43.793
to the all-pervading Power
of Divine love.

00:41:43.818 --> 00:41:49.739
This is not love which is stupid -
love that thinks.

00:41:49.764 --> 00:41:55.453
Love that is truth. Love that is
joy.

00:41:55.478 --> 00:42:03.270
All this is built in within you, and now
you have got realization,

00:42:03.295 --> 00:42:12.613
so instead of evolving yourself, you just
jump into things which are of no value.

00:42:13.146 --> 00:42:20.295
And so many Sahaja Yogis get lost.
I was recently told by someone

00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:22.804
that we have lost about hundred
sahaja yogis,

00:42:22.829 --> 00:42:29.623
because they started following another
sahaja yogi, who started seeing things.

00:42:30.147 --> 00:42:33.739
So they also wanted to see.

00:42:33.764 --> 00:42:42.348
If you can see something that means
you are not there, simple thing.

00:42:44.222 --> 00:42:50.275
If I am, say, on the top of a mountain,
then I’m there.

00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:53.896
But if I am away from the mountain
I can see it.

00:42:53.921 --> 00:42:59.605
The more you see something that means
you are away from it.

00:42:59.630 --> 00:43:02.128
Did you follow this point?

00:43:02.153 --> 00:43:10.008
So, the subtle, the sukshma,
state is that

00:43:10.033 --> 00:43:15.448
where you are yourself that.

00:43:15.896 --> 00:43:20.444
So, how can you see yourself?

00:43:20.469 --> 00:43:24.698
This is the point Sahaja Yogis must
understand. Anybody who can –

00:43:24.723 --> 00:43:28.623
“Mother, oh no he can see, he saw
auras around You,

00:43:28.648 --> 00:43:34.835
he can see this thing.” So,
how can you see?

00:43:34.860 --> 00:43:40.051
Because you are that, you can’t see.
So, all such people

00:43:40.076 --> 00:43:44.245
who are very popular sometimes,
in the beginning of Sahaja Yoga

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:52.280
try to control you and befool you.
And then you are thrown out.

00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.916
Now, this is what we call is
the judgement.

00:43:57.941 --> 00:44:04.999
There are sieves and sieves and sieves
through which you have to pass.

00:44:05.365 --> 00:44:11.795
Where you get enamoured by this or that, or you fall for this or that,

00:44:11.820 --> 00:44:19.991
all these things are there in a step-
by-step how you are arriving.

00:44:21.341 --> 00:44:29.149
You are arriving at that point where
your destruction is sure.

00:44:29.174 --> 00:44:36.478
Because you have to become the Spirit.
You have to rise in spiritual life.

00:44:36.503 --> 00:44:42.333
And if your movement is downward,
who can help you?

00:44:42.358 --> 00:44:49.388
This is a very interesting time as I told
you, is the time of judgement.

00:44:49.413 --> 00:44:55.768
And at this time we have to be careful
that we are our own judges.

00:44:55.793 --> 00:45:00.591
Nobody has to tell you that you are
catching this one and catching that one.

00:45:00.616 --> 00:45:06.653
You yourself can feel it what chakras
you are catching.

00:45:06.678 --> 00:45:10.768
Whatever I may try on My own

00:45:10.793 --> 00:45:15.407
to suck in all your problems,
do whatever is possible,

00:45:15.432 --> 00:45:22.933
to keep you rising and rising and rising,
but what I feel

00:45:22.958 --> 00:45:35.338
that this method of helping you
will not make you so strong,

00:45:35.363 --> 00:45:39.436
because you’ll always think that,
“After all, Mother will suck my problem.”

00:45:39.461 --> 00:45:44.350
If I get hundred letters, out of them
ninety-nine are of sahaja yogis

00:45:44.375 --> 00:45:50.808
who are suffering from this trouble
or that trouble. I’m amazed,

00:45:50.833 --> 00:45:58.874
you have all these qualities already
awakened in you, they are in you.

00:46:00.317 --> 00:46:03.189
You use them.

00:46:04.604 --> 00:46:07.192
Somebody will say, “That fellow
is troubling me,

00:46:07.217 --> 00:46:13.243
that wife is troubling me, the husband
troubling me.” Just forgive!

00:46:13.268 --> 00:46:20.181
Just forgive! Your power of forgiveness
is poor.

00:46:20.206 --> 00:46:24.366
Moreover, more than what the saints
have written

00:46:24.391 --> 00:46:33.885
you have got the power of truth.
You know the reality.

00:46:34.190 --> 00:46:40.755
Much more than those saints who
have praised the Goddess.

00:46:41.319 --> 00:46:45.457
If you could just think as to what
level you are sitting

00:46:45.482 --> 00:46:52.842
you wouldn’t fall, you wouldn’t go
down that much.

00:46:52.867 --> 00:46:58.808
Only problem is you have to know that
your ascent has to be spiritual,

00:46:58.833 --> 00:47:06.311
and already these qualities are very
well balanced and put within you.

00:47:06.336 --> 00:47:12.277
More than dharma. Dharma maybe,
you have a power

00:47:12.302 --> 00:47:21.150
to give up or to fall down, but these
powers are never destroyed within you.

00:47:21.399 --> 00:47:29.455
I remember once I went to America
first time and I met one gentleman.

00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:32.122
The next day he came and he told Me,
“Mother, I am changed,

00:47:32.147 --> 00:47:35.728
I am changed, I am changed.”
“What happened?”

00:47:35.753 --> 00:47:41.097
“You know, I used to hate my uncle,
I never wanted to talk to him,

00:47:41.122 --> 00:47:46.842
very angry with him, but this time,
just imagine,

00:47:46.867 --> 00:47:52.116
yesterday I met him, I went and hugged
him, and kissed him, and I said,

00:47:52.141 --> 00:47:54.871
‘Now, I have forgiven you,
completely forgiven you,

00:47:54.896 --> 00:47:59.260
now don’t think about feeling guilty
about it.

00:47:59.285 --> 00:48:03.852
He started looking at me
like this.’”

00:48:04.500 --> 00:48:06.645
So, with the Kundalini awakening

00:48:06.670 --> 00:48:12.359
all these beautiful qualities you have
will come up.

00:48:12.384 --> 00:48:17.851
And then your generosity,

00:48:19.498 --> 00:48:26.020
your beautiful being, which is
enlightened by the Spirit

00:48:26.045 --> 00:48:32.894
will prove to the world that Sahaja
Yoga is the truth.

00:48:34.377 --> 00:48:42.661
Yesterday’s beautiful dramas
have shown us,

00:48:42.686 --> 00:48:47.793
but it should not be a mental
satisfaction within you,

00:48:47.818 --> 00:48:50.240
that “I have got the realization,
now I am this”.

00:48:50.265 --> 00:48:57.984
No. No. No mental. It’s a state,
it’s a state,

00:48:58.009 --> 00:49:02.588
and that state to achieve, you have
to really meditate

00:49:02.613 --> 00:49:12.424
and find time for meditation
every night, every morning.

00:49:12.449 --> 00:49:16.665
The more you’ll meditate the better
it will be.

00:49:16.690 --> 00:49:26.587
No excuses are to be given or to be
convincing to yourself.

00:49:26.612 --> 00:49:32.833
Everything is unimportant. Your ascent
is very important,

00:49:32.858 --> 00:49:38.544
if you really want to save this world
from - in this Kali Yuga.

00:49:38.569 --> 00:49:43.417
I think today I have made it
very clear to you

00:49:43.442 --> 00:49:49.384
what qualities already are instilled
within you.

00:49:49.409 --> 00:49:55.965
They are there. They are not dharmas,
but qualities.

00:49:55.990 --> 00:49:58.532
They are just within you,

00:49:58.557 --> 00:50:05.102
only thing you have turned your attention
to something opposite,

00:50:05.127 --> 00:50:10.217
otherwise all these qualities are
already instilled within you.

00:50:10.242 --> 00:50:17.381
They are already there. And nothing can
destroy them, except for you yourself.

00:50:17.406 --> 00:50:21.992
If you have destroyed them,
nobody can help.

00:50:22.017 --> 00:50:25.859
May God bless you all.
