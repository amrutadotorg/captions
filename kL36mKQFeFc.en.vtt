00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.970
now I think we should have put you first

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.250
what is self-realization and how do you

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.250
grant it

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.760
a sensitization

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:37.430
is the epitome of our evolutionary

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:40.890
process which is a living process

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.949
through which you achieve your higher

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:51.269
self even Darwin who was an atheist did

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:54.890
say that as human beings have come so

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:59.220
far they will achieve their absolutely

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.640
so to achieve your absolutely success

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.649
the purpose of her life the meaning of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.860
her life

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:11.550
is only achieved when we get connected

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.789
with the divine power which is

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:17.670
all-pervading now one need not believe

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.030
in the divine power but you can see the

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:24.780
manifestation of this living divine

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.080
power when you see a flower becoming a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.860
fruit all living work is done by this

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.520
divine power but we are not aware at

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:38.700
this human stage we are not aware of it

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.520
but once this happening takes place in

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:44.160
your awareness it's not just a listing

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.280
that you become something greater on on

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:50.729
mental level but actualization of this

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.880
experience is felt in your awareness on

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.099
your central nervous system you can feel

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.729
that you have to come again I say you

00:01:56.099 --> 00:02:02.599
have become not old or brainwashed but

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:08.610
you have become collectively conscious

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:13.230
is a state where you can feel yourself

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:15.930
inside and other student now the

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.810
knowledge of this is the knowledge of

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:22.230
the roots whatever we have achieved is

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:26.160
the lawn of the tree but in the tree our

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:30.030
grows itself from its root then it made

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:34.170
our so it is time that we should find

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:37.800
out about the roots and to know about

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.580
that you have to become a setter at this

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:43.560
human awareness you cannot but sometimes

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.690
it challenges the evolve people you

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.600
think why not I am such as such what

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:55.310
should I know but you cannot as you have

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:55.310
to have a microscope to see things

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:03.480
deeply in the same way you have to have

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:06.720
this new awareness within this dynamic

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:11.000
awareness of course the nature of self

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:16.370
is that it is collectively conscious

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.370
that it is the source of peace and bliss

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:25.069
that it is the truth and love just the

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.350
nature and you become that you become

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:30.239
it's not only mental but you really

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:42.390
become because whatever is mental is

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:45.810
artificial and yes the unconscious

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:49.980
becomes conscious means it comes into

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:53.190
your central nervous system it is within

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:56.750
you everyone I said if Christ has said

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.819
it mama that's any Buddha has said it

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.590
Barrera has said it everyone has said

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:07.829
the same thing but now say then say same

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.019
system everything has said that you are

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:13.170
to be born again there has to be some

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.930
transformation they didn't tell us lies

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.669
but the trouble is people can use this

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:24.229
for their own purpose and mislead others

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:29.760
that's a different point but logically

00:04:24.229 --> 00:04:35.479
the disciples of the Seekers also must

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:38.729
know that you must feel your own powers

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:42.780
you must feel yourself otherwise what's

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.669
the use of just following somebody when

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.530
you achieve nothing of your own what did

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:49.240
you achieve is the main point decency

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.780
and had

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:55.419
this self-realization on mass yes

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.120
that's the only thing is new today is

00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:01.110
that it can be done on mass level that's

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.000
why in India it is called as Mahayana

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:07.840
formerly it was done from one or two

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.180
days but now on very masterly we had

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:12.880
once they were there six thousand people

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.190
in a village contribution all of them

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:17.530
were trained us in India is very easy

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.259
because they are not so complicated but

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:22.479
Indians take it for granted they know

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:24.699
what sahaja yoga means they know what

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:25.479
realization is I mean they are trained

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.070
than me

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:31.389
or I should say they have conditioned

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:34.930
entry that they understand it faster but

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:38.349
when the Western people get it they are

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.930
sometimes difficult but once they get it

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:43.240
they are very deep and they think this

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:45.550
is the solution the only solution will

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:50.440
all the calamity so they work it out

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:57.010
very seriously we do that mean

00:05:50.440 --> 00:06:00.940
very beautiful realization to waste

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:03.880
I used to think so but the other day in

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.220
Adelaide I was amazed that they got it

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:08.800
without anything so many of them there

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:11.139
must be about 300 people at work it was

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.139
all facts when they all caught it so all

00:06:11.139 --> 00:06:16.630
my ideas about that also are now

00:06:14.139 --> 00:06:20.009
changing that suddenly I am meeting the

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.009
right type of increment

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:34.510
have you do it how do I do it

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:37.000
audacity spontaneous a see if you put it

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:40.510
in the mother earth it sprouts by itself

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.910
you cannot say how we do but because you

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:44.650
are just ready for it's like one

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:47.110
enlightened light can enlighten another

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:50.920
life even if you put your hands towards

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:55.170
me like this and then you can give it to

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.170
others once you get it you can give it

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:03.100
due respect we get a lot of based

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:04.960
business to Australia you know with

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:15.220
different brand or different types of

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:18.010
religion see you must use your base for

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:22.630
everything God has given you a very

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:25.360
detailed and not and logically you must

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:27.600
be proper confusion about your

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:30.580
realization first of all you must surely

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.920
find out whether you want your

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.230
realization or not because if some

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:37.720
people want to fly in the air then I

00:07:35.230 --> 00:07:40.690
can't leave that which some people want

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:42.940
to have diamonds that I can do some sort

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:46.930
of funny miracles that they do all these

00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:52.870
tricks so here to be honest first of all

00:07:46.930 --> 00:07:55.210
about secondly you must know that this

00:07:52.870 --> 00:07:58.120
Islam of God and you cannot sell it in

00:07:55.210 --> 00:08:01.009
the water it's not purchasing

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:03.889
that's one of a very important one

00:08:01.009 --> 00:08:07.039
children because they pamper your ego in

00:08:03.889 --> 00:08:10.789
a way that you are purchasing your goal

00:08:07.039 --> 00:08:13.729
is that he's in your pocket but you

00:08:10.789 --> 00:08:19.060
cannot pocket the GUI GUI has to be

00:08:13.729 --> 00:08:23.509
higher than then you have to find out

00:08:19.060 --> 00:08:24.289
lifestyle of such a way how we see how

00:08:23.509 --> 00:08:28.069
he lives

00:08:24.289 --> 00:08:31.250
is he an honest man is he a righteous

00:08:28.069 --> 00:08:34.550
person or easy you must find out the

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:36.560
credibility of such a person apart from

00:08:34.550 --> 00:08:40.159
that we must find out the credibility of

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:42.349
the followers what are they doing there

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:46.250
are so many gurus who have got followers

00:08:42.349 --> 00:08:48.800
for 18 years 16 years and their ecliptic

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:51.230
if the Guru can't even look after their

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:54.230
hair then what sense of having such a

00:08:51.230 --> 00:08:56.720
guru for yourself but human beings are

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.930
very competitive in certain things it's

00:08:56.720 --> 00:09:01.490
not very very very quantitative

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:03.020
amusingly like they see a conscience

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.910
coming out of the pub following in their

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:07.550
letters and they intervene to the same

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:10.279
sort of things it's sort of a

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.709
competition that they did not identify

00:09:10.279 --> 00:09:15.200
this man has gone to this google argue

00:09:12.709 --> 00:09:17.060
it's a factor little talk who is your

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:22.310
woman or the other self this is my gurus

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:25.250
we didn't defend that sense professor

00:09:22.310 --> 00:09:28.490
yes what I'm saying this is a special

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:29.690
time a time of your resurrect the time

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:35.680
of your judgement

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:38.990
so there is a need there is a need but

00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:41.230
people are so vulnerable and so naive I

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:45.709
would say very nice not to understand

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:48.560
who is right and who is wrong it's very

00:09:45.709 --> 00:09:54.020
simple we will come out of the jail wear

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:56.329
a funny dress and go to America sit in a

00:09:54.020 --> 00:09:59.390
square I start singing something

00:09:56.329 --> 00:10:02.000
phonetic everybody talking

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:04.160
very great moreover the kind of fire you

00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:06.680
figure too complex I think people have

00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:08.300
who are householders they think they are

00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:12.260
very selfish they are aiming their

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:14.060
children and their housing it is not it

00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:16.190
is one of the greatest job is to be

00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:18.680
properly married and to have nice

00:10:16.190 --> 00:10:21.170
children but if you see somebody wearing

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.980
that dress he has given up everything in

00:10:21.170 --> 00:10:28.750
the world you see you feel so enamored

00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:28.750
its superficially you cannot judge it

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:49.130
you believe that you're the only true

00:10:45.680 --> 00:11:04.900
guru and other other organizations who

00:10:49.130 --> 00:11:09.320
offer in life don't want to come down

00:11:04.900 --> 00:11:13.790
they don't want to fix it be I sent one

00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:15.530
fellow degree of persuasion to America I

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.110
ran away being three things from there

00:11:15.530 --> 00:11:19.490
he said they can't understand their

00:11:17.110 --> 00:11:23.560
other way around people they can't

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:27.150
understand God they understand dollars

00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.980
so there are many and they recognized me

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:32.320
that's why when they say that she's they

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:34.000
what did you say later Saint or anything

00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:39.940
you got said by these fools only have

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:42.160
ruled that practice meditation in a very

00:11:39.940 --> 00:11:43.900
simplified form when you feel this cool

00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:45.610
vibration on your hand and above your

00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:48.070
head and over your body you know that

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:50.170
you're in meditation that's it that's it

00:11:48.070 --> 00:11:51.520
you do any silver sounds and not as many

00:11:50.170 --> 00:11:55.620
just a few if you've got a specific

00:11:51.520 --> 00:11:58.600
problem you see depends on its what

00:11:55.620 --> 00:12:00.430
sentence when you have a problem say for

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:03.520
example you were talking in your stomach

00:12:00.430 --> 00:12:06.340
now you have to do certain exercise for

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:09.010
that first short time till you get rid

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:11.860
of it or maybe that if you have to say

00:12:09.010 --> 00:12:14.800
certain mantras for any to excite or to

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:17.140
awaken that part given you in true

00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:19.330
liveliness that's how it is very

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:21.430
scientific but gradually you know it so

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.240
easy becomes the more thing becomes so

00:12:21.430 --> 00:12:26.050
easy

00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:27.730
because when you are expanding towards

00:12:26.050 --> 00:12:30.150
the felt very very the whole thing

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:33.220
becomes complex but when you integrate

00:12:30.150 --> 00:12:35.050
towards decision then everything is very

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:36.940
simple you have to be with simple

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:40.060
principles and once you know how to

00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:43.240
manage that for example balance balance

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:46.860
in a person is really balanced in a

00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.330
person is not dealt with in say in

00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.490
medical science why do we have one

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:53.980
medical scientific am psychologist yeah

00:12:51.490 --> 00:12:57.070
they said that you have one doctor for

00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:03.280
one ionizer dr. Onodera here is one

00:12:57.070 --> 00:13:05.590
person who is the one who your see the

00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.170
diagnosis you he gives you realization

00:13:05.590 --> 00:13:10.150
is everything the laboratory the

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:13.090
complete instrument it's you will get in

00:13:10.150 --> 00:13:15.580
this muted by God within you you to feel

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:17.160
it's all there just to be connected to

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:19.870
the mains that's all

00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:21.580
it's already there I mean nothing

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:23.560
fantastic for me because I know it is

00:13:21.580 --> 00:13:25.480
there but once you get it you are amazed

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:28.050
how you have started working it out

00:13:25.480 --> 00:13:28.050
because

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:51.300
when did you know that you had been born

00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:52.950
with you see it is like if I asked a

00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:55.070
question when you rediscover you are a

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:57.120
human being you won't be able to say

00:13:55.070 --> 00:14:00.390
it's simple as that

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:02.190
see Emma's fight aware of it well you

00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:05.630
say self rearming I know I'm a human

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.630
being I mean what do you mean by self

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:12.840
it's a higher level of awareness than

00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:14.970
human awareness you're not using your

00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:18.420
thinking brain you're not using your

00:14:14.970 --> 00:14:20.700
emotional brain you're using what is

00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.560
basically the all-pervading power of God

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:26.820
the unconscious about which one is

00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:30.540
deflected with a young spoke about you

00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:33.060
as Kundalini because in Sanskrit

00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:35.430
language it is called as Kundalini but

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.690
this also work is so terrifying to

00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:39.090
people those who are great about

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.510
Kundalini they get up right she's your

00:14:39.090 --> 00:14:41.430
mother

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:43.650
the one who has to give you the rebirth

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:45.540
now there are people who are between so

00:14:43.650 --> 00:14:48.330
many such big books without knowing

00:14:45.540 --> 00:14:51.150
where the Kundalini la right the magic

00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:53.160
absolutely wait now you can see it in

00:14:51.150 --> 00:14:55.560
some people position of the pavilion we

00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:58.710
have got also on videotape some of these

00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:01.980
instruments so when some people where

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:03.930
there was obstruction the pulsation the

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.310
pulsation you can see sometimes this

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:11.490
triangular bone sacrum just pulsating

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:14.580
but imagine this thing was called as

00:15:11.490 --> 00:15:17.220
sacrum means cyclic and I asked the

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:21.090
Greek people I said why did you call it

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:24.730
signal as if we had 34 with me

00:15:21.090 --> 00:15:27.220
windows Arion group much before

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:31.350
Alexander went to India and they told us

00:15:27.220 --> 00:15:31.350
that this boat is the separate
