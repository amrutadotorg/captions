WEBVTT

00:12.080 --> 00:16.970
now I think we should have put you first

00:16.980 --> 00:22.250
what is self-realization and how do you

00:19.650 --> 00:22.250
grant it

00:22.840 --> 00:26.760
a sensitization

00:28.050 --> 00:37.430
is the epitome of our evolutionary

00:33.480 --> 00:40.890
process which is a living process

00:37.430 --> 00:46.949
through which you achieve your higher

00:40.890 --> 00:51.269
self even Darwin who was an atheist did

00:46.949 --> 00:54.890
say that as human beings have come so

00:51.269 --> 00:59.220
far they will achieve their absolutely

00:54.890 --> 01:02.640
so to achieve your absolutely success

00:59.220 --> 01:03.649
the purpose of her life the meaning of

01:02.640 --> 01:07.860
her life

01:03.649 --> 01:11.550
is only achieved when we get connected

01:07.860 --> 01:14.789
with the divine power which is

01:11.550 --> 01:17.670
all-pervading now one need not believe

01:14.789 --> 01:21.030
in the divine power but you can see the

01:17.670 --> 01:24.780
manifestation of this living divine

01:21.030 --> 01:28.080
power when you see a flower becoming a

01:24.780 --> 01:31.860
fruit all living work is done by this

01:28.080 --> 01:34.520
divine power but we are not aware at

01:31.860 --> 01:38.700
this human stage we are not aware of it

01:34.520 --> 01:41.520
but once this happening takes place in

01:38.700 --> 01:44.160
your awareness it's not just a listing

01:41.520 --> 01:47.280
that you become something greater on on

01:44.160 --> 01:50.729
mental level but actualization of this

01:47.280 --> 01:53.880
experience is felt in your awareness on

01:50.729 --> 01:56.099
your central nervous system you can feel

01:53.880 --> 01:59.729
that you have to come again I say you

01:56.099 --> 02:02.599
have become not old or brainwashed but

01:59.729 --> 02:08.610
you have become collectively conscious

02:02.599 --> 02:13.230
is a state where you can feel yourself

02:08.610 --> 02:15.930
inside and other student now the

02:13.230 --> 02:18.810
knowledge of this is the knowledge of

02:15.930 --> 02:22.230
the roots whatever we have achieved is

02:18.810 --> 02:26.160
the lawn of the tree but in the tree our

02:22.230 --> 02:30.030
grows itself from its root then it made

02:26.160 --> 02:34.170
our so it is time that we should find

02:30.030 --> 02:37.800
out about the roots and to know about

02:34.170 --> 02:41.580
that you have to become a setter at this

02:37.800 --> 02:43.560
human awareness you cannot but sometimes

02:41.580 --> 02:45.690
it challenges the evolve people you

02:43.560 --> 02:48.600
think why not I am such as such what

02:45.690 --> 02:55.310
should I know but you cannot as you have

02:48.600 --> 02:55.310
to have a microscope to see things

02:56.310 --> 03:03.480
deeply in the same way you have to have

02:59.610 --> 03:06.720
this new awareness within this dynamic

03:03.480 --> 03:11.000
awareness of course the nature of self

03:06.720 --> 03:16.370
is that it is collectively conscious

03:11.000 --> 03:16.370
that it is the source of peace and bliss

03:16.970 --> 03:25.069
that it is the truth and love just the

03:22.500 --> 03:28.350
nature and you become that you become

03:25.069 --> 03:30.239
it's not only mental but you really

03:28.350 --> 03:42.390
become because whatever is mental is

03:30.239 --> 03:45.810
artificial and yes the unconscious

03:42.390 --> 03:49.980
becomes conscious means it comes into

03:45.810 --> 03:53.190
your central nervous system it is within

03:49.980 --> 03:56.750
you everyone I said if Christ has said

03:53.190 --> 03:59.819
it mama that's any Buddha has said it

03:56.750 --> 04:04.590
Barrera has said it everyone has said

03:59.819 --> 04:07.829
the same thing but now say then say same

04:04.590 --> 04:10.019
system everything has said that you are

04:07.829 --> 04:13.170
to be born again there has to be some

04:10.019 --> 04:15.930
transformation they didn't tell us lies

04:13.170 --> 04:19.669
but the trouble is people can use this

04:15.930 --> 04:24.229
for their own purpose and mislead others

04:19.669 --> 04:29.760
that's a different point but logically

04:24.229 --> 04:35.479
the disciples of the Seekers also must

04:29.760 --> 04:38.729
know that you must feel your own powers

04:35.479 --> 04:42.780
you must feel yourself otherwise what's

04:38.729 --> 04:44.669
the use of just following somebody when

04:42.780 --> 04:46.530
you achieve nothing of your own what did

04:44.669 --> 04:49.240
you achieve is the main point decency

04:46.530 --> 04:52.780
and had

04:49.240 --> 04:55.419
this self-realization on mass yes

04:52.780 --> 04:58.120
that's the only thing is new today is

04:55.419 --> 05:01.110
that it can be done on mass level that's

04:58.120 --> 05:04.000
why in India it is called as Mahayana

05:01.110 --> 05:07.840
formerly it was done from one or two

05:04.000 --> 05:10.180
days but now on very masterly we had

05:07.840 --> 05:12.880
once they were there six thousand people

05:10.180 --> 05:15.190
in a village contribution all of them

05:12.880 --> 05:17.530
were trained us in India is very easy

05:15.190 --> 05:20.259
because they are not so complicated but

05:17.530 --> 05:22.479
Indians take it for granted they know

05:20.259 --> 05:24.699
what sahaja yoga means they know what

05:22.479 --> 05:25.479
realization is I mean they are trained

05:24.699 --> 05:27.070
than me

05:25.479 --> 05:31.389
or I should say they have conditioned

05:27.070 --> 05:34.930
entry that they understand it faster but

05:31.389 --> 05:38.349
when the Western people get it they are

05:34.930 --> 05:40.930
sometimes difficult but once they get it

05:38.349 --> 05:43.240
they are very deep and they think this

05:40.930 --> 05:45.550
is the solution the only solution will

05:43.240 --> 05:50.440
all the calamity so they work it out

05:45.550 --> 05:57.010
very seriously we do that mean

05:50.440 --> 06:00.940
very beautiful realization to waste

05:57.010 --> 06:03.880
I used to think so but the other day in

06:00.940 --> 06:06.220
Adelaide I was amazed that they got it

06:03.880 --> 06:08.800
without anything so many of them there

06:06.220 --> 06:11.139
must be about 300 people at work it was

06:08.800 --> 06:14.139
all facts when they all caught it so all

06:11.139 --> 06:16.630
my ideas about that also are now

06:14.139 --> 06:20.009
changing that suddenly I am meeting the

06:16.630 --> 06:20.009
right type of increment

06:23.430 --> 06:34.510
have you do it how do I do it

06:27.180 --> 06:37.000
audacity spontaneous a see if you put it

06:34.510 --> 06:40.510
in the mother earth it sprouts by itself

06:37.000 --> 06:42.910
you cannot say how we do but because you

06:40.510 --> 06:44.650
are just ready for it's like one

06:42.910 --> 06:47.110
enlightened light can enlighten another

06:44.650 --> 06:50.920
life even if you put your hands towards

06:47.110 --> 06:55.170
me like this and then you can give it to

06:50.920 --> 06:55.170
others once you get it you can give it

06:57.510 --> 07:03.100
due respect we get a lot of based

07:00.240 --> 07:04.960
business to Australia you know with

07:03.100 --> 07:15.220
different brand or different types of

07:04.960 --> 07:18.010
religion see you must use your base for

07:15.220 --> 07:22.630
everything God has given you a very

07:18.010 --> 07:25.360
detailed and not and logically you must

07:22.630 --> 07:27.600
be proper confusion about your

07:25.360 --> 07:30.580
realization first of all you must surely

07:27.600 --> 07:32.920
find out whether you want your

07:30.580 --> 07:35.230
realization or not because if some

07:32.920 --> 07:37.720
people want to fly in the air then I

07:35.230 --> 07:40.690
can't leave that which some people want

07:37.720 --> 07:42.940
to have diamonds that I can do some sort

07:40.690 --> 07:46.930
of funny miracles that they do all these

07:42.940 --> 07:52.870
tricks so here to be honest first of all

07:46.930 --> 07:55.210
about secondly you must know that this

07:52.870 --> 07:58.120
Islam of God and you cannot sell it in

07:55.210 --> 08:01.009
the water it's not purchasing

07:58.120 --> 08:03.889
that's one of a very important one

08:01.009 --> 08:07.039
children because they pamper your ego in

08:03.889 --> 08:10.789
a way that you are purchasing your goal

08:07.039 --> 08:13.729
is that he's in your pocket but you

08:10.789 --> 08:19.060
cannot pocket the GUI GUI has to be

08:13.729 --> 08:23.509
higher than then you have to find out

08:19.060 --> 08:24.289
lifestyle of such a way how we see how

08:23.509 --> 08:28.069
he lives

08:24.289 --> 08:31.250
is he an honest man is he a righteous

08:28.069 --> 08:34.550
person or easy you must find out the

08:31.250 --> 08:36.560
credibility of such a person apart from

08:34.550 --> 08:40.159
that we must find out the credibility of

08:36.560 --> 08:42.349
the followers what are they doing there

08:40.159 --> 08:46.250
are so many gurus who have got followers

08:42.349 --> 08:48.800
for 18 years 16 years and their ecliptic

08:46.250 --> 08:51.230
if the Guru can't even look after their

08:48.800 --> 08:54.230
hair then what sense of having such a

08:51.230 --> 08:56.720
guru for yourself but human beings are

08:54.230 --> 08:58.930
very competitive in certain things it's

08:56.720 --> 09:01.490
not very very very quantitative

08:58.930 --> 09:03.020
amusingly like they see a conscience

09:01.490 --> 09:04.910
coming out of the pub following in their

09:03.020 --> 09:07.550
letters and they intervene to the same

09:04.910 --> 09:10.279
sort of things it's sort of a

09:07.550 --> 09:12.709
competition that they did not identify

09:10.279 --> 09:15.200
this man has gone to this google argue

09:12.709 --> 09:17.060
it's a factor little talk who is your

09:15.200 --> 09:22.310
woman or the other self this is my gurus

09:17.060 --> 09:25.250
we didn't defend that sense professor

09:22.310 --> 09:28.490
yes what I'm saying this is a special

09:25.250 --> 09:29.690
time a time of your resurrect the time

09:28.490 --> 09:35.680
of your judgement

09:29.690 --> 09:38.990
so there is a need there is a need but

09:35.680 --> 09:41.230
people are so vulnerable and so naive I

09:38.990 --> 09:45.709
would say very nice not to understand

09:41.230 --> 09:48.560
who is right and who is wrong it's very

09:45.709 --> 09:54.020
simple we will come out of the jail wear

09:48.560 --> 09:56.329
a funny dress and go to America sit in a

09:54.020 --> 09:59.390
square I start singing something

09:56.329 --> 10:02.000
phonetic everybody talking

09:59.390 --> 10:04.160
very great moreover the kind of fire you

10:02.000 --> 10:06.680
figure too complex I think people have

10:04.160 --> 10:08.300
who are householders they think they are

10:06.680 --> 10:12.260
very selfish they are aiming their

10:08.300 --> 10:14.060
children and their housing it is not it

10:12.260 --> 10:16.190
is one of the greatest job is to be

10:14.060 --> 10:18.680
properly married and to have nice

10:16.190 --> 10:21.170
children but if you see somebody wearing

10:18.680 --> 10:23.980
that dress he has given up everything in

10:21.170 --> 10:28.750
the world you see you feel so enamored

10:23.980 --> 10:28.750
its superficially you cannot judge it

10:43.480 --> 10:49.130
you believe that you're the only true

10:45.680 --> 11:04.900
guru and other other organizations who

10:49.130 --> 11:09.320
offer in life don't want to come down

11:04.900 --> 11:13.790
they don't want to fix it be I sent one

11:09.320 --> 11:15.530
fellow degree of persuasion to America I

11:13.790 --> 11:17.110
ran away being three things from there

11:15.530 --> 11:19.490
he said they can't understand their

11:17.110 --> 11:23.560
other way around people they can't

11:19.490 --> 11:27.150
understand God they understand dollars

11:23.560 --> 11:29.980
so there are many and they recognized me

11:27.150 --> 11:32.320
that's why when they say that she's they

11:29.980 --> 11:34.000
what did you say later Saint or anything

11:32.320 --> 11:39.940
you got said by these fools only have

11:34.000 --> 11:42.160
ruled that practice meditation in a very

11:39.940 --> 11:43.900
simplified form when you feel this cool

11:42.160 --> 11:45.610
vibration on your hand and above your

11:43.900 --> 11:48.070
head and over your body you know that

11:45.610 --> 11:50.170
you're in meditation that's it that's it

11:48.070 --> 11:51.520
you do any silver sounds and not as many

11:50.170 --> 11:55.620
just a few if you've got a specific

11:51.520 --> 11:58.600
problem you see depends on its what

11:55.620 --> 12:00.430
sentence when you have a problem say for

11:58.600 --> 12:03.520
example you were talking in your stomach

12:00.430 --> 12:06.340
now you have to do certain exercise for

12:03.520 --> 12:09.010
that first short time till you get rid

12:06.340 --> 12:11.860
of it or maybe that if you have to say

12:09.010 --> 12:14.800
certain mantras for any to excite or to

12:11.860 --> 12:17.140
awaken that part given you in true

12:14.800 --> 12:19.330
liveliness that's how it is very

12:17.140 --> 12:21.430
scientific but gradually you know it so

12:19.330 --> 12:22.240
easy becomes the more thing becomes so

12:21.430 --> 12:26.050
easy

12:22.240 --> 12:27.730
because when you are expanding towards

12:26.050 --> 12:30.150
the felt very very the whole thing

12:27.730 --> 12:33.220
becomes complex but when you integrate

12:30.150 --> 12:35.050
towards decision then everything is very

12:33.220 --> 12:36.940
simple you have to be with simple

12:35.050 --> 12:40.060
principles and once you know how to

12:36.940 --> 12:43.240
manage that for example balance balance

12:40.060 --> 12:46.860
in a person is really balanced in a

12:43.240 --> 12:49.330
person is not dealt with in say in

12:46.860 --> 12:51.490
medical science why do we have one

12:49.330 --> 12:53.980
medical scientific am psychologist yeah

12:51.490 --> 12:57.070
they said that you have one doctor for

12:53.980 --> 13:03.280
one ionizer dr. Onodera here is one

12:57.070 --> 13:05.590
person who is the one who your see the

13:03.280 --> 13:08.170
diagnosis you he gives you realization

13:05.590 --> 13:10.150
is everything the laboratory the

13:08.170 --> 13:13.090
complete instrument it's you will get in

13:10.150 --> 13:15.580
this muted by God within you you to feel

13:13.090 --> 13:17.160
it's all there just to be connected to

13:15.580 --> 13:19.870
the mains that's all

13:17.160 --> 13:21.580
it's already there I mean nothing

13:19.870 --> 13:23.560
fantastic for me because I know it is

13:21.580 --> 13:25.480
there but once you get it you are amazed

13:23.560 --> 13:28.050
how you have started working it out

13:25.480 --> 13:28.050
because

13:43.550 --> 13:51.300
when did you know that you had been born

13:47.010 --> 13:52.950
with you see it is like if I asked a

13:51.300 --> 13:55.070
question when you rediscover you are a

13:52.950 --> 13:57.120
human being you won't be able to say

13:55.070 --> 14:00.390
it's simple as that

13:57.120 --> 14:02.190
see Emma's fight aware of it well you

14:00.390 --> 14:05.630
say self rearming I know I'm a human

14:02.190 --> 14:05.630
being I mean what do you mean by self

14:08.270 --> 14:12.840
it's a higher level of awareness than

14:10.920 --> 14:14.970
