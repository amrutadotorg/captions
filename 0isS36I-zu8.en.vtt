00:00:08.782 --> 00:00:12.540
It’s your birthright as a human&nbsp;
being to become the Spirit.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.480
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha&nbsp;
means “with” and ja is “born."

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:27.720
Born with you is the right to get this&nbsp;
yoga, is the union with the divine.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.880
It’s your birthright as a human being.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.372
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:46.945
And it has to work out, but please&nbsp;
open your hearts and open your minds.

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.472
The unique experience of self-realization&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:49.472 --> 00:00:54.925
takes place when the primordial energy&nbsp;
called Kundalini is correctly awakened&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:59.869
by someone who has already experienced&nbsp;
and mastered their own self-realization.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.608
Shri Mataji has explained that the Kundalini&nbsp;
is the power of our spiritual ascent found&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:06.608 --> 00:01:11.280
in the triangular bone at the base of&nbsp;
the spine called sacrum by the Greeks.

00:01:12.925 --> 00:01:15.265
It is the power of our pure desire.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.100
When awakened the Kundalini rises spontaneously&nbsp;
through six subtle centers called chakras.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.557
The Kundalini then emerges through the&nbsp;
fontanelle bone area at the top of the&nbsp;&nbsp;head

00:01:28.557 --> 00:01:33.758
emitting a cool breeze that can&nbsp;
be felt there as well as on the hands.
