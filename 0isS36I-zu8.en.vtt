00:08.782 --> 00:12.540
It’s your birthright as a human
being to become the Spirit.

00:13.620 --> 00:18.480
That is what Sahaja Yoga is – Saha
means “with” and ja is “born."

00:18.480 --> 00:27.720
Born with you is the right to get this
yoga, is the union with the divine.

00:29.040 --> 00:32.880
It’s your birthright as a human being.

00:32.880 --> 00:38.372
You are as I told you at the epitome of evolution.

00:39.900 --> 00:46.945
And it has to work out, but please
open your hearts and open your minds.

00:46.945 --> 00:49.472
The unique experience of self-realization

00:49.472 --> 00:54.925
takes place when the primordial energy
called Kundalini is correctly awakened

00:54.925 --> 00:59.869
by someone who has already experienced
and mastered their own self-realization.

01:01.000 --> 01:06.608
Shri Mataji has explained that the Kundalini
is the power of our spiritual ascent found

01:06.608 --> 01:11.280
in the triangular bone at the base of
the spine called sacrum by the Greeks.

01:12.925 --> 01:15.265
It is the power of our pure desire.

01:16.800 --> 01:23.100
When awakened the Kundalini rises spontaneously
through six subtle centers called chakras.

01:23.700 --> 01:28.557
The Kundalini then emerges through the
fontanelle bone area at the top of thehead

01:28.557 --> 01:33.758
emitting a cool breeze that can
be felt there as well as on the hands.
