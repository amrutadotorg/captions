00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.656
Today is a great day

00:00:50.712 --> 00:00:57.880
when we are celebrating Mahalakshmi’s Puja.

00:01:01.946 --> 00:01:08.081
You must be knowing that today is the day
of Mary,

00:01:08.282 --> 00:01:13.739
mother of Christ, who was Mahalakshmi.

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:35.125
Mahalakshmi’s incarnation is very important
for Sahaja Yoga.

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:45.398
First She establishes our dharma

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:54.401
by which we become righteous,

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:04.070
we become religious in the real sense.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:17.425
After the light of Realisation we cannot
do anything that is not dharma.

00:02:23.012 --> 00:02:27.168
As you know what is dharma is,

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:36.007
and the maryadas, the boundaries
of our behavior.

00:02:39.166 --> 00:02:43.843
This transformation takes place
automatically.

00:02:47.054 --> 00:02:49.674
I don’t have to tell you, “Don’t do this,
don’t do this,”

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:53.401
like ten commandments.

00:02:57.765 --> 00:03:02.591
You yourself establish your dharma

00:03:03.733 --> 00:03:07.923
and you enjoy your virtues.

00:03:11.181 --> 00:03:16.392
This happens, as you know – already has
happened to all of you

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:22.581
with the grace of Mahalakshmi.

00:03:24.216 --> 00:03:29.446
Then She starts bestowing blessings on you.

00:03:31.948 --> 00:03:36.405
First the blessing is of physical
well-being

00:03:49.467 --> 00:04:03.404
by which your parasympathetic nervous
system gets into proper shape

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:12.405
and a balance is established,

00:04:14.669 --> 00:04:20.938
as if the Mahalakshmi principle holds
the reins

00:04:22.719 --> 00:04:26.562
and you cannot cross the limits,

00:04:27.925 --> 00:04:32.965
you cannot go too much to the left
or to the right.

00:04:35.072 --> 00:04:44.120
By this principle you realise what is wrong
with the outside religions,

00:04:48.484 --> 00:04:52.844
you realise also that inside

00:04:53.824 --> 00:04:58.667
all the religions are born

00:04:59.485 --> 00:05:05.131
like flowers on the same of tree
of spirituality.

00:05:05.926 --> 00:05:10.657
And automatically you start worshipping

00:05:11.872 --> 00:05:15.309
all the prophets

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:20.840
right from Abraham, Moses,

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.924
Confucius, Lao Tse, Mohammed Sahib, Nanak.

00:05:35.356 --> 00:05:38.375
You worship them!

00:05:38.576 --> 00:05:43.443
It is not that you have respect, but you
worship,

00:05:44.766 --> 00:05:52.047
and thus you lose the barriers
of fundamentalism.

00:05:57.184 --> 00:06:04.225
By the ascent, with this principle, you
achieve a personality

00:06:04.426 --> 00:06:09.051
by which you become a universal being.

00:06:13.865 --> 00:06:23.393
You understand the problems of your country
and of your race,

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:32.894
and you transcend to see what’s wrong
with them and how to correct them.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:43.255
When the Mahalakshmi principle is awakened
we realise

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:54.481
that outside we may be different but inside
we are just the same.

00:06:58.691 --> 00:07:06.968
All the masters and prophets are just
the same,

00:07:10.207 --> 00:07:14.698
whatever religion they might have been
born.

00:07:17.778 --> 00:07:22.937
Now this Mahalakshmi principle goes
out of gear

00:07:23.138 --> 00:07:32.139
because of left or right-side movement
of our attention.

00:07:38.849 --> 00:07:41.046
Even people come to Sahaja Yoga

00:07:41.247 --> 00:07:47.115
and they start going either to the left
or to the right.

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:55.093
One has to keep a proper watch,

00:07:56.062 --> 00:08:00.861
because you have come to Sahaja Yoga
to ascend.

00:08:02.795 --> 00:08:05.960
Now, if you move to the right side

00:08:06.161 --> 00:08:12.389
then you start fighting with your leader,

00:08:15.358 --> 00:08:18.935
finding faults with the leader,

00:08:19.172 --> 00:08:22.396
and, as Christ has said, you become
‘murmuring souls’ –

00:08:22.597 --> 00:08:27.889
you start talking ill about the leader.

00:08:32.191 --> 00:08:35.999
I have appointed Myself the leaders,

00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:43.183
and I know what’s wrong with them or what’s
not wrong with them.

00:08:45.077 --> 00:08:48.640
They are in close contact with Me,

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:54.583
so you don’t have to judge them,

00:08:55.608 --> 00:09:00.360
by that you are hampering the progress

00:09:01.334 --> 00:09:06.922
of Sahaja Yoga and your own.

00:09:09.040 --> 00:09:15.740
Then there are other people who try
to find out new methods.

00:09:19.950 --> 00:09:27.276
Such people are extremely difficult

00:09:28.243 --> 00:09:34.768
because their ego conditions them so much
that they don’t see what’s wrong with them,

00:09:39.858 --> 00:09:46.608
and they don’t know they are doing anti-God
activities.

00:09:49.626 --> 00:09:56.951
They are not creating problem for themselves
but for others also.

00:09:59.141 --> 00:10:07.476
Anybody who starts like this suffers a lot,

00:10:07.677 --> 00:10:11.450
there is no joy on their face,

00:10:12.501 --> 00:10:16.470
they just try to show off

00:10:17.692 --> 00:10:23.097
and it is very, very dangerous!

00:10:24.232 --> 00:10:27.005
I have seen people who have tried all
these tricks

00:10:27.205 --> 00:10:32.267
and fallen into lots of problems

00:10:35.381 --> 00:10:40.187
because Sahaja Yoga has it’s own culture,

00:10:41.782 --> 00:10:45.447
it has it’s own methods

00:10:46.936 --> 00:10:52.057
which are absolutely approved by Me.

00:10:54.682 --> 00:10:59.470
There is no need to start some new methods,

00:11:00.769 --> 00:11:04.720
if so they should get out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:06.918 --> 00:11:10.647
This is the worst type of ego!

00:11:12.293 --> 00:11:18.356
And one should not have anything to do
with such people.

00:11:19.902 --> 00:11:24.917
Already everything has been researched
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:26.736 --> 00:11:31.161
All the knowledge is already there,

00:11:32.264 --> 00:11:36.985
but this comes from a kind of a ego

00:11:37.186 --> 00:11:42.246
which doesn’t feel the vibrations very
well,

00:11:45.507 --> 00:11:50.841
and then you try to push away from
the Mahalakshmi principle.

00:11:55.746 --> 00:12:01.566
The left-side people, when they move,
they fall into the trap

00:12:01.767 --> 00:12:09.226
of other type of gurus or other type
of readings, even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:15.605 --> 00:12:19.599
Sometimes people who’ll get too much
attached to their wives, to their children,

00:12:19.799 --> 00:12:24.282
to their family, too much attached,

00:12:29.058 --> 00:12:32.656
they become very left-sided.

00:12:33.601 --> 00:12:38.551
They have no joy and they don’t want others
to enjoy.

00:12:41.510 --> 00:12:45.517
Such people also should go out of Sahaja
Yoga.

00:12:46.554 --> 00:12:53.328
Till they have overcome their attachments
they should not be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:57.443 --> 00:13:04.273
Mahalakshmi principle is extremely
helpful, extremely nourishing

00:13:04.474 --> 00:13:15.170
and is the only way we can achieve
our realisation and enlightenment

00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:31.058
but one has to have proper balance.

00:13:34.685 --> 00:13:40.170
In the beginning Mahalakshmi principle
incarnated on this earth

00:13:40.371 --> 00:13:46.042
as the wife of Shri Rama – Shri Sita.

00:13:54.381 --> 00:14:02.281
Then came the second incarnation
at the time of Shri Krishna as Radha,

00:14:05.446 --> 00:14:11.887
‘Ra’ is energy, ‘dha’ is the one which
sustains.

00:14:15.388 --> 00:14:23.821
And then came the incarnation of
Mahalakshmi, is the Mother of Christ.

00:14:27.263 --> 00:14:36.953
The Christianity has failed because they
did not recognise the powers of Mary.

00:14:41.517 --> 00:14:45.900
This Paul was a hater of women

00:14:48.192 --> 00:14:52.320
and showed no respect to women.

00:14:53.278 --> 00:14:56.128
As a result of that,

00:14:56.329 --> 00:15:04.618
the women who are following so-called
Christianity became very insecure.

00:15:09.397 --> 00:15:18.871
Of course in Catholic Church, as you know,
a woman is not, cannot become, a priest,

00:15:22.398 --> 00:15:27.536
and also in the Protestant Church

00:15:27.736 --> 00:15:35.380
they don’t want to accept women as priests
– big, big fight going on!

00:15:37.979 --> 00:15:44.128
Even in the Orthodox Church they treat
women as dirt.

00:15:46.067 --> 00:15:51.842
As a result women in the West have become
extremely insecure.

00:15:55.058 --> 00:16:01.289
The way they accept to be nude, to expose
their body, to sell their body,

00:16:01.490 --> 00:16:06.573
because they are so insecure, they have
no identity.

00:16:13.001 --> 00:16:18.081
If supposing in India a man tries to have
relationship with another woman,

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:23.073
the wife says, “All right, you go to hell,
I don’t care.

00:16:30.309 --> 00:16:32.290
You are committing a sin, all right,
go ahead,

00:16:32.491 --> 00:16:35.778
I have nothing to do with you,”

00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:42.141
and the whole society will support that
way.

00:16:43.723 --> 00:16:50.451
But in the west the position of woman
is really, really very, very low,

00:16:53.817 --> 00:16:57.626
absolutely primitive.

00:16:57.851 --> 00:17:01.849
They are mothers, they are sisters, they
are grandmothers,

00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.730
they are daughters and wives.

00:17:11.105 --> 00:17:18.999
I didn’t understand why the women in
the west are so anxious to attract the men.

00:17:22.981 --> 00:17:28.897
In India if any man looks at the woman,
she’ll go and slap his face.

00:17:34.445 --> 00:17:38.244
This insecurity is so much that I have seen
in films

00:17:38.445 --> 00:17:42.891
women becoming nude everywhere, they have
all kinds of nude clubs and all that,

00:17:43.092 --> 00:17:47.481
but men never become, men never.

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:05.701
That I’ve seen films where women will
become nude and they show vulgarity,

00:18:05.902 --> 00:18:13.387
everything acceptably nonsense, while
men were never take out their clothes.

00:18:22.393 --> 00:18:24.931
As if the body of men is something special

00:18:25.132 --> 00:18:31.146
and the body of women is not to be
respected.

00:18:35.236 --> 00:18:39.027
It is a very primitive idea.

00:18:39.815 --> 00:18:44.928
I can’t understand this, because it is
the Adi Shakti

00:18:45.129 --> 00:18:48.354
who has created this Universe

00:18:52.446 --> 00:18:55.847
not Sadashiva.

00:18:56.614 --> 00:19:03.463
Even if women are not respected and they
are not respectable,

00:19:03.664 --> 00:19:07.288
the Gods cannot reside in that country.

00:19:15.976 --> 00:19:22.861
So, we have to understand that women should
have their own dignity

00:19:26.153 --> 00:19:32.945
and they should not yield to the pressures
of men

00:19:33.146 --> 00:19:37.463
where they try to debase them.

00:19:43.825 --> 00:19:49.758
But at the same time, they must respect
their husbands, their men-folk,

00:19:49.959 --> 00:19:55.203
and they have to be extremely loving
and compassionate.

00:20:03.834 --> 00:20:14.223
Now, in the Western thinking they can’t
understand a Immaculate Conception,

00:20:16.673 --> 00:20:20.460
they don’t understand God.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:28.104
It is God, and Divinity can do anything!

00:20:32.327 --> 00:20:43.731
As you know Shri Ganesha was created
by Parvati Herself, without Her husband,

00:20:49.838 --> 00:20:54.417
and Indians do not doubt it.

00:20:56.385 --> 00:21:00.259
After all He is God

00:21:00.460 --> 00:21:04.609
and She is Adi Shakti.

00:21:05.245 --> 00:21:10.148
Now you see so many miracle photographs
have come,

00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:15.447
for you to see for yourself

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.770
that there are miracles created,

00:21:23.281 --> 00:21:26.163
not in the photographs, otherwise also
you have seen

00:21:26.364 --> 00:21:30.541
so many miracles happening in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:34.860 --> 00:21:42.084
When I told that Ganesha is our Lord
Jesus Christ,

00:21:42.285 --> 00:21:45.454
people would not believe it.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:56.869
So I said symbolically, if you see from
the right to the left,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:22:00.559
you will see Swastika

00:22:03.514 --> 00:22:10.147
on the Mooladhara, which is made
of carbon atom.

00:22:12.393 --> 00:22:18.410
And if you can make a photograph
of a carbon atom,

00:22:20.025 --> 00:22:26.897
and see it from right to the left, you do
see the Swastika.

00:22:29.617 --> 00:22:35.831
This is the fact, is established.

00:22:36.056 --> 00:22:41.665
And if you see from the left to the right,
it is Omkara.

00:22:43.981 --> 00:22:52.128
So thus what I’ve said is verified,
scientifically.

00:22:54.775 --> 00:22:58.441
But if you see from down below upward,

00:22:58.642 --> 00:23:04.609
then what do you see is the Alpha and
Omega.

00:23:08.559 --> 00:23:14.509
Now Christ has said, “I am the Alpha
and I am the Omega.”

00:23:17.377 --> 00:23:24.758
I do not know even at that time there was
talk of alpha and omega

00:23:29.377 --> 00:23:33.259
but now it is scientifically proved.

00:23:34.796 --> 00:23:38.999
There are many other things about soul
and everything –

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:44.184
now we have scientifically proved it.

00:23:47.757 --> 00:23:51.939
Also now they are working on genes

00:23:52.981 --> 00:23:59.147
and they have found out that a person who
is evil, who is wrong,

00:23:59.348 --> 00:24:05.563
who is not normal is because of a bad gene.

00:24:11.894 --> 00:24:15.232
That is what is the bhoot.

00:24:17.964 --> 00:24:25.457
So this is how, you see, science is coming
closer to Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:28.617 --> 00:24:36.032
but scientists find it very difficult
to accept Me.

00:24:37.861 --> 00:24:44.782
They can’t understand that I could be
the source of Divine power.

00:24:48.557 --> 00:24:56.022
Till you have vibrations, how can you feel,
how can you understand?

00:25:01.831 --> 00:25:08.233
Despite that, now Sahaja Yoga is spreading
in 55 countries,

00:25:11.257 --> 00:25:23.120
but the most important thing is to keep
your Mahalakshmi principle clean and open.

00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:36.402
That is, a woman who is Mahalakshmi
is a very good housewife,

00:25:36.603 --> 00:25:39.647
very good queen, Raja Lakshmi.

00:25:39.848 --> 00:25:45.574
There are ashta Lakshmis, there are eight
forms of Lakshmi,

00:25:50.364 --> 00:25:56.766
and these eight forms of Lakshmi are to be

00:25:56.967 --> 00:26:02.274
expressed, manifested by a sahaja yogini.

00:26:07.290 --> 00:26:16.829
And the men must respect this Mahalakshmi
principle within them.

00:26:18.275 --> 00:26:23.637
First of all they have to be dharmic

00:26:25.496 --> 00:26:30.860
and the basis of dharma is respect.

00:26:33.088 --> 00:26:38.375
Must develop respect and dedication.

00:26:41.257 --> 00:26:44.338
If you cannot surrender and detach,

00:26:44.539 --> 00:26:49.951
you cannot enter into Mahalakshmi channel.

00:26:53.471 --> 00:26:58.890
Either you will be money-oriented or
power-oriented.

00:27:03.681 --> 00:27:16.463
So, you have to be detached from money
and power.

00:27:21.672 --> 00:27:28.676
Then Mahalakshmi principle starts working
and you become a seeker.

00:27:33.064 --> 00:27:40.371
On every chakra Mahalakshmi gives you
Her blessings,

00:27:43.461 --> 00:27:53.377
but at the Sahasrara She gives you
the collective consciousness.

00:27:58.041 --> 00:28:07.716
She makes you deft in Sahaja Yoga practice
and also understanding.

00:28:13.074 --> 00:28:16.897
I have seen, gradually, sahaja yogis have
become very subtle

00:28:17.098 --> 00:28:21.636
and I can talk to them on a very subtle
level.

00:28:29.416 --> 00:28:35.735
I am so happy, today, we are here
to celebrate Mahalakshmi principle

00:28:35.936 --> 00:28:42.817
at the time of Mother Mary’s birthday.

00:28:51.458 --> 00:28:58.239
She passed through the greatest ordeal
to see Her son being crucified

00:29:02.594 --> 00:29:08.813
but She knew what was the purpose
of His crucifixion

00:29:10.468 --> 00:29:14.179
and She accepted.

00:29:14.605 --> 00:29:23.344
I can’t see a cross, if somebody is wearing
a cross I say, “Take out cross!”,

00:29:28.972 --> 00:29:36.995
because the message of Christ is
resurrection and not crucifixion.

00:29:44.419 --> 00:29:49.891
But perhaps the Christians, especially
Paul must have thought

00:29:50.092 --> 00:29:56.974
that he should use cross to make everybody
feel guilty.

00:30:04.604 --> 00:30:08.568
This Paul has really done so much harm

00:30:08.798 --> 00:30:18.129
that, only after reading a treatise
of ‘Nag Nagamani of Hammadi’,

00:30:18.330 --> 00:30:29.796
I found out that Thomas had to run away
to India to tell the truth.

00:30:39.184 --> 00:30:46.918
With this Mahalakshmi principle our
attention should be on our virtues,

00:30:51.779 --> 00:30:57.206
and we must enjoy our generosity,

00:30:59.653 --> 00:31:05.158
we must enjoy our purity.

00:31:07.578 --> 00:31:15.693
We should enjoy our innocence and chastity
– even men have to do that.

00:31:22.675 --> 00:31:26.738
We should enjoy our detachments.

00:31:29.933 --> 00:31:37.050
All this is already within your reach.

00:31:40.994 --> 00:31:44.458
I’ve felt these people, when they were
dancing,

00:31:44.659 --> 00:31:51.086
that they are all from Kashmir in,
from India,

00:31:56.411 --> 00:32:03.046
and Adi Shakti incarnated first in Kashmir.

00:32:06.096 --> 00:32:11.030
I find Bulgarians very close to Indians.

00:32:13.805 --> 00:32:17.433
And also Romanians.

00:32:19.298 --> 00:32:23.014
Your talent in music I’ve seen,

00:32:23.215 --> 00:32:30.065
and that’s why you all can sing Indian
music so easily.

00:32:35.776 --> 00:32:44.352
I bless you, all sahaja yogis, that you
develop a proper sense of balance

00:32:49.743 --> 00:32:57.666
and that you spread Sahaja Yoga all over
Bulgaria,

00:33:00.043 --> 00:33:05.810
making everyone joyous and happy as you
are.

00:33:09.653 --> 00:33:13.740
We have to change the world.

00:33:14.098 --> 00:33:17.867
It’s a tremendous task,

00:33:18.068 --> 00:33:27.150
is the greatest event in the history
of spirituality

00:33:29.728 --> 00:33:34.229
and you are the participant of that.

00:33:34.727 --> 00:33:42.736
So you have to understand that your purity
is very important

00:33:46.312 --> 00:33:53.669
and your surrendering will definitely
help you

00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:58.658
to ascend, faster and faster.

00:34:03.634 --> 00:34:05.111
So may God bless you.
