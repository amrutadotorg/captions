00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:02.759
Shri Mataji: All right, start it.

00:00:02.759 --> 00:00:05.650
[Warren Reeves gives an introduction of 8.5
minutes.]

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.100
Shri Mataji: Good evening.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:08.180
Audience: Good evening.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:17.870
Shri Mataji: Today is the last day, when I
have to go.

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:29.520
And you can understand a mother who has so
many children, she has to go from one to another;

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:45.819
she has the expectation to meet her children
and she has the concern and the longing for

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:52.780
whom she has so much love.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:01:02.069
That's very difficult to express those feelings:
like waves as if they are taking out something

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:08.909
from you.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.850
I do not know really how to thank you all.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.570
Without you I cannot enjoy anything.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:24.640
As I told you, even I may be the Capitalist
and I may have all these powers, so-called,

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.750
I'm a complete Communist, I can't enjoy it
alone.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.049
I have to share it with you.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:45.289
At the very outset, I would like to thank
Mr. Sig Paulsen for making it available for

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.340
Me, this beautiful church.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:02:03.869
And you all that I could manifest My love,
could have a rapport with you, whom I have

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.800
known before.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.930
I'm meeting you again, thanks to him.

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:15.110
I have to thank Betty, specially.

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:16.700
She has been so earnest.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.490
She wrote to Me letters, she telephoned to
Me again and again.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:32.380
Oh, she took so much trouble to see that I
come to Houston.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.050
She has made these four days, fantastic visit
for Me.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:47.770
You all have to thank her for what she's done,
it's a very, very great thing that she thought

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.650
of you all and of sharing her joy with you
all.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.400
She got her realization in Australia.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:05.560
It's a chain of thanking, for which I have
to thank Doctor Warren who came to India for

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:13.510
his realization, and I got stuck to him...

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:19.400
He was running every moment and he got his
realization.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.040
Then we have other people here from India.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:32.490
Nirmala Modi has come all the way, she's a
very wise Sahaj yogini.

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:39.120
And then we have Hugo, you know he came all
the way.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.570
Went to Japan from Australia, bought these
equipments and he's come to New York, then

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.530
to Houston.

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:58.060
Think of them, how much they feel responsible
that they should communicate truth to you

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:04.290
and that they should arrange this beautiful
program.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.060
Warren's wife has also come here.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:15.400
We have also, another American, Michael, who
is helping a lot.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:23.840
The best of all, I would say is one of my
eldest sons, is Mr Gavin Brown.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.510
Who had something to do with Houston.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:35.020
And when I wanted him to put some money for
American tour, I don't know why, he put it

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:36.050
in Houston Bank.

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.450
I said, "Why Houston of all the things?

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:41.570
I may never go there."

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.970
He says, "No Mother, Houston is the place."

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.550
Still the money is lying in the Bank here,
for next years program perhaps.

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.460
He has worked very hard and he's going to
stay on here.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.630
He's a quiet person.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.860
But he knows a lot about Sahaj Yoga.

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:04.140
He knows it thoroughly.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:10.980
He'll tell you each and every thing: How to
cure you chakras.

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:13.830
How to feel all right.

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.450
Now today, on this day, I'm going to tell
you about the Spirit.

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:28.161
I have told you about the seven chakras, about
the three nadis, the three channels, that

00:05:28.161 --> 00:05:30.280
are within us.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:39.700
And today I want to tell you about the nature
of the Spirit.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:45.260
The Spirit resides us in our heart.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.870
It's the reflection of God Almighty.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:06:01.190
In Sanskrit language: this aspect of God which
is all-pervading and is the first and the

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:10.990
last, is called as Sadashiva, is the Father,
who does not incarnate.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:20.210
We say Yahova, you can say, or the God who
does not incarnate.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:33.820
This great aspect which encompasses everything
ultimately and also manifests everything,

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:39.750
is reflected within our heart as the Spirit.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:44.110
This aspect is just the witness aspect.

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:57.300
It witnesses the play of its power, the Primordial
Power, the Holy Ghost, to see what is created

00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:59.139
by Her.

00:06:59.139 --> 00:07:01.300
He's the only enjoyer of the game.

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:05.480
He sees the game, the leela, the fun.

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:11.680
She organizes everything, it is She who gets
divided into three powers, it is She who creates

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:19.240
the whole universe, it is She who gives us
this evolution, it is She who makes us human

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:25.830
beings and it is She who has to make us the
higher human being.

00:07:25.830 --> 00:07:31.550
That's the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Holy
Ghost and the reflection of that is this Kundalini

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:35.360
within us.

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:37.840
These two have to meet.

00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:43.910
They are separated; the Spirit within you
and the Holy Ghost within you have to meet.

00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:49.120
That is the Yoga, that's the union.

00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:55.780
The seat of the Spirit is on top of your head
here, but He resides in human beings in the

00:07:55.780 --> 00:08:01.430
heart; of course it comes out also and watches
you.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:07.720
It is not in our conscious mind, it resides
and watches the whole field.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.930
[DEL: In San- ] In Gita He's called as Kshetragya,
the one who knows the field, the knower of

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:13.930
the field.

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:20.250
He knows everything, He watches; He's just
watching, where we go, what we do, what compromises

00:08:20.250 --> 00:08:27.930
we make, how we run after our seeking, how
we go to falsehood, what we do; everything

00:08:27.930 --> 00:08:31.230
it is watching.

00:08:31.230 --> 00:08:37.669
The Holy Ghost is the one which receives the
information and records everything in itself

00:08:37.669 --> 00:08:46.730
but the information is given by the deity
who is the seed or the spirit of Jesus Christ

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:54.029
who is sitting down there, Ganesha.

00:08:54.029 --> 00:09:02.209
The Spirit itself is Sat-Chitt-Ananda.

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:11.850
He exists in the state of truth.

00:09:11.850 --> 00:09:15.100
Now we do not know what truth is.

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:18.589
People say, "God is Love, God is Truth."

00:09:18.589 --> 00:09:25.369
Now what is the truth?

00:09:25.369 --> 00:09:31.130
The truth is this all-pervading power.

00:09:31.130 --> 00:09:47.009
And this all-pervading power is the nature
of the Spirit, which gives you the absolute

00:09:47.009 --> 00:09:52.749
knowledge; now mark it; absolute knowledge.

00:09:52.749 --> 00:10:00.589
For example, if you have to say, "What is
the shape of this ...?"

00:10:00.589 --> 00:10:03.800
You will say, "It's a pyramid."

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:14.649
All right, but is it a good thing to have
a pyramid for a church or not?

00:10:14.649 --> 00:10:20.180
There could be hundred opinions on that.

00:10:20.180 --> 00:10:25.399
But if you ask Me, or ask any Sahaj yogi,
they said, "Yes, it has to be a pyramid."

00:10:25.399 --> 00:10:29.230
Why?

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:34.800
Because in a pyramid there is a coefficience
and you feel the vibrations.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:43.769
It's absolutely, absolute knowledge.

00:10:43.769 --> 00:10:46.100
That's the truth you know.

00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:51.899
You want to know if a person is fake or not.

00:10:51.899 --> 00:11:02.290
You just put your hands like this and ask
a question, "Is he true?"

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:07.790
Your vibrations will stop, you may even get
blisters, if you ask such a question about

00:11:07.790 --> 00:11:11.250
someone.

00:11:11.250 --> 00:11:15.440
So you do not know through your mental activity.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.529
A person may look very nice, as I told you,
he may behave in such a manner, that you'll

00:11:19.529 --> 00:11:21.810
feel, "Oh, what a fine man he is."

00:11:21.810 --> 00:11:28.179
Is such and such person is a realized soul
or not?

00:11:28.179 --> 00:11:30.791
How will you know?

00:11:30.791 --> 00:11:34.970
You'll just put your hands towards that person
and you'll start getting the vibrations from

00:11:34.970 --> 00:11:38.240
that person; you'll enjoy them.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:47.490
Only after realization only we can really
enjoy other person - really enjoy.

00:11:47.490 --> 00:11:54.829
One day I was in Calcutta and staying in a
hotel on My way to Singapore, and there was

00:11:54.829 --> 00:11:59.329
a very great soul who came to see Me.

00:11:59.329 --> 00:12:01.519
And he just sneaked into the room.

00:12:01.519 --> 00:12:07.389
See, sometimes it happens that some of these
great souls who live in Himalayas and all

00:12:07.389 --> 00:12:10.489
that, they come in.

00:12:10.489 --> 00:12:13.040
And he just saw Me and he fell at my feet.

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:20.610
And there were at least five, six Sahaj yogis
staying in other rooms and suddenly they felt

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:29.480
tremendous cool, joy falling on them, a cold
shower like thing.

00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:34.470
And they all came running, one after another.

00:12:34.470 --> 00:12:36.970
"What's happened, what happened?"

00:12:36.970 --> 00:12:38.259
And he was at My feet.

00:12:38.259 --> 00:12:42.870
They opened the door and they said, "Oh, Mother!"

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:45.430
"Mother, how did you come?"

00:12:45.430 --> 00:12:46.459
"Oh, Mother!"

00:12:46.459 --> 00:12:48.259
And then they started feeling him.

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:51.589
He was enjoying Me, I was enjoying him.

00:12:51.589 --> 00:12:55.689
And they were all enjoying him.

00:12:55.689 --> 00:13:00.329
You don't have to tell whether a person is
true or not.

00:13:00.329 --> 00:13:07.279
There is no mental deduction, it just happens.

00:13:07.279 --> 00:13:08.279
You start feeling.

00:13:08.279 --> 00:13:11.949
Even children are like that, even small children.

00:13:11.949 --> 00:13:16.930
If they are realized souls, immediately they'll
say, "This is this and this is this," finished.

00:13:16.930 --> 00:13:19.809
There's no compromise, how can you compromise?

00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:24.720
That's what I told you yesterday that Christ
never compromised.

00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:29.730
He'd never compromised.

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:35.449
How can you compromise with darkness if you
are light?

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:39.450
So the first thing you are, you are the truth.

00:13:39.450 --> 00:13:46.309
The Spirit tells you what is the truth.

00:13:46.309 --> 00:13:52.269
It tells you everything about everything.

00:13:52.269 --> 00:14:04.920
It is the truth; the knowledge that is pure
is the truth.

00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.329
As I told you, Gavin Brown, when he got his
realization, he said, "My father has not telephoned"

00:14:10.329 --> 00:14:15.739
and he put his hands there and he got a burning
here and when they telephoned, he found out

00:14:15.739 --> 00:14:19.910
that his father was down with bronchitis,
and I told him the exactly the same thing.

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:30.779
Now a person who came to Me the other day
who had multiple sclerosis - is a very serious

00:14:30.779 --> 00:14:35.939
disease according to doctors, but according
to Me it is not.

00:14:35.939 --> 00:14:40.290
And everybody told Me the same centers he
was catching.

00:14:40.290 --> 00:14:47.029
Of course because I have been in the medicine,
I have been in the medical college, I know

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:50.389
these chakras means what.

00:14:50.389 --> 00:14:51.920
And he told Me that he had this problem.

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:57.910
Even if he not told Me, I would have known
that he had this problem.

00:14:57.910 --> 00:15:01.709
Everybody will see the same centre is catching.

00:15:01.709 --> 00:15:06.610
So, you are the truth.

00:15:06.610 --> 00:15:12.139
Then after some time you cannot bear untruth.

00:15:12.139 --> 00:15:18.230
You cannot bear falsehood, I mean, we also
are like that, I tell you.

00:15:18.230 --> 00:15:23.589
For example, if I tell you that, "You come
along here there's a very nice chair for you."

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:26.240
Now you don't see any chair there.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:32.079
"Oh you sit down, it is there, believe Me,
imagine there's a chair."

00:15:32.079 --> 00:15:35.179
I mean, nobody would accept that, will you?

00:15:35.179 --> 00:15:36.179
You don't see any chair.

00:15:36.179 --> 00:15:37.179
"There is any.-"

00:15:37.179 --> 00:15:41.199
"No, no, but the imaginary, there is one,
I have placed it, you can't see, I have made

00:15:41.199 --> 00:15:42.199
it invisible.

00:15:42.199 --> 00:15:45.199
You see you just see, you sit down you'll
get it."

00:15:45.199 --> 00:15:50.809
All right you sit down there, and you sit
in that position and after some time you start

00:15:50.809 --> 00:15:51.809
getting the pain.

00:15:51.809 --> 00:15:57.819
"Where's the chair, how do I get the pain."

00:15:57.819 --> 00:16:05.029
That's what Warren told you, it's very practical.

00:16:05.029 --> 00:16:13.250
You immediately know that this is not the
way.

00:16:13.250 --> 00:16:26.529
Now the first centre is very important, is
of the innocence, which gives you the magnetic

00:16:26.529 --> 00:16:27.610
powers.

00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:34.779
In the sense not only that you are attractive
but, I mean you attract people, but magnetic

00:16:34.779 --> 00:16:39.019
means that you know whether you are moving
to the north or to the south.

00:16:39.019 --> 00:16:43.420
Birds have this power in them, birds have.

00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:48.100
That's how they fly from one place to another.

00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:50.790
Because they can feel the magnet within.

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:56.629
And a person who is pure at that point, he
never gets lost because he knows which side

00:16:56.629 --> 00:16:57.629
he's moving.

00:16:57.629 --> 00:17:01.529
I mean, I have that power, I have never had
a problem like that.

00:17:01.529 --> 00:17:06.480
I move either to the left or to the right,
or to forward.

00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:09.770
And My husband who is dealing with shipping,
he says, "I have never met a better navigator

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:10.770
than my wife."

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:18.949
And it's so spontaneous, I mean, I don't have
to think, I know for definite that you are

00:17:18.949 --> 00:17:21.299
moving in the wrong direction or in the right
direction.

00:17:21.299 --> 00:17:25.350
Even the material movement I mean to say.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:31.409
All of them have experience, they have great
drivers and they have got all the maps and

00:17:31.409 --> 00:17:32.409
everything.

00:17:32.409 --> 00:17:38.500
And immediately I know that you are going
on the wrong direction because the magnet

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:42.320
immediately turns round.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:47.100
So the magnet is placed within you there,
but it is to be awakened.

00:17:47.100 --> 00:17:54.610
When it is awakened, these deities when they're
awakened, you become the truth.

00:17:54.610 --> 00:18:01.700
Like the light that comes in, you start seeing
everything as far as your feelings are concerned,

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:03.860
your experiencing is concerned.

00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:09.270
So you become the truth.

00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.320
Now one may say, "How truth could be love?"

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.830
That's a very common question.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:20.640
Truth cannot be love because, I mean, if you
tell somebody something that is truth, he

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:26.790
may not like, and he may be unhappy and it
may not be dear to him, and he might be very,

00:18:26.790 --> 00:18:30.909
very worried about it.

00:18:30.909 --> 00:18:40.639
Manu said, long time back that, "You should
speak the truth and you must speak the things

00:18:40.639 --> 00:18:42.940
which are dear to others."

00:18:42.940 --> 00:18:44.940
"Satyam vadet, priyam vadet."

00:18:44.940 --> 00:18:50.240
People said, "It's not possible, it's an absurd
situation, how can you do it?"

00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:56.700
So Krishna has put something in between, he
said, "Satyam vadet, hitam vadet, priyam vadet."

00:18:56.700 --> 00:19:06.429
You say something that is the truth, always
say the truth, and say something hitam, means

00:19:06.429 --> 00:19:11.169
for the pleasing of your Spirit.

00:19:11.169 --> 00:19:13.990
That's the condition.

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:21.600
And ultimately that becomes a very dear thing.

00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:29.220
In the beginning one may not like it, but
ultimately, this will be very much liked,

00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:30.620
this truth.

00:19:30.620 --> 00:19:35.890
So all these three he has put together and
said that, "You have to speak the truth, the

00:19:35.890 --> 00:19:49.070
truth has to be pleasing to the Spirit, and
ultimately, the person is going to enjoy it."

00:19:49.070 --> 00:20:03.500
So the truth is: everything is illusion, except
for the Divine Love of God that is all-pervading

00:20:03.500 --> 00:20:11.340
which you can feel through your Spirit.

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:21.870
This power has got telecommunication, it has
got all that you have created in the science,

00:20:21.870 --> 00:20:23.860
it can coordinate and cooperates.

00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:33.519
It has got all the angels and all the great
souls to help it and to look after you.

00:20:33.519 --> 00:20:45.300
And the top, topping the whole thing is the
quality that loves, it loves you.

00:20:45.300 --> 00:20:56.890
So it doesn't come to you like a sword, it
gives you the time to improve, to judge yourself,

00:20:56.890 --> 00:21:08.159
to rise, to grow, just as a mother would look
after her child, forgive mistakes, see that

00:21:08.159 --> 00:21:16.909
the child rises and grows into complete manhood.

00:21:16.909 --> 00:21:29.659
So it is love and the love that is so powerful
is the truth; and it never fails, it never

00:21:29.659 --> 00:21:32.080
fails.

00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:35.019
For example you might think now, a man like
Sadat has died.

00:21:35.019 --> 00:21:36.460
[Ed: Anwar el Sadat was assassinated on 6
Oct 1981, the day before this talk.]

00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:37.460
"Mother how do you explain?"

00:21:37.460 --> 00:21:42.370
I mean, you never die, that's one thing you
do not know.

00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:48.190
He can be born again, he would be born in
such a condition where he'll be much more

00:21:48.190 --> 00:21:53.610
effective.

00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:58.100
He has himself died at the top of his glory.

00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:02.279
I mean for him, he's a martyr.

00:22:02.279 --> 00:22:08.330
If you see from his angle, everywhere in the
whole world, "Sadat."

00:22:08.330 --> 00:22:12.210
Sa-dat, it's a big name too.

00:22:12.210 --> 00:22:19.179
But supposing he had fallen in his glory and
all that, then he would have died, then God

00:22:19.179 --> 00:22:23.909
would not have been just to him, I would say.

00:22:23.909 --> 00:22:29.100
But he died in all his glory and he can be
born again.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:41.740
And he can take a position from where he can
do much better work, in the name of God, in

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:47.820
the field of God because now we don't have
to do any more work, otherwise in any other

00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.820
field.

00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:53.759
We have had enough of trains, we don't want
any more now.

00:22:53.759 --> 00:22:58.740
We have had enough of plastics, now we have
mountains.

00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:05.769
We have got too much of butter around, too
much of food, everything bit too much, I mean

00:23:05.769 --> 00:23:09.820
the house becomes a junk.

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.130
In any field we have overdone things.

00:23:12.130 --> 00:23:15.230
We have exhausted this Mother Earth.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:17.940
Now what do we have to do?

00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:24.769
Only in one field and the field that is of
God's work you have to do it.

00:23:24.769 --> 00:23:29.160
But first you have to get connected and then
do the God's work.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:36.759
And that connection is only through your spirit,
when you become absolute and you have the

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:42.539
truth within you as a built-in awareness.

00:23:42.539 --> 00:23:47.170
Is the awareness that becomes the truth.

00:23:47.170 --> 00:23:58.019
So the first quality of the spirit is that
you become the truth, that you know the truth,

00:23:58.019 --> 00:24:03.200
that you take a stand on the truth.

00:24:03.200 --> 00:24:05.149
Look at Christ.

00:24:05.149 --> 00:24:10.760
He had nothing to do with women like Mary
Magdalene, I mean, nothing to do, I mean,

00:24:10.760 --> 00:24:17.049
He was virtue.

00:24:17.049 --> 00:24:18.909
He was innocence.

00:24:18.909 --> 00:24:23.850
But when He saw people were stoning her, He
took up a stand.

00:24:23.850 --> 00:24:25.179
He took up a stand.

00:24:25.179 --> 00:24:29.970
You have to take up a stand, stand on the
truth.

00:24:29.970 --> 00:24:34.200
And he said, "Those who have not committed
any sin can throw, and you can throw the stone

00:24:34.200 --> 00:24:35.570
at Me".

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:39.890
And nobody did.

00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:43.940
He did this because He was standing on the
truth.

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:52.029
He took a whip and whipped those people who
were selling in the temple of God.

00:24:52.029 --> 00:25:01.070
At the age when he was a little boy, he went
and argued with learned people.

00:25:01.070 --> 00:25:04.110
Such people have no fear of anything.

00:25:04.110 --> 00:25:05.870
What is there to fear?

00:25:05.870 --> 00:25:09.820
When you are standing on the truth, what is
there to fear?

00:25:09.820 --> 00:25:19.350
Truth is such a light that it gives you complete
picture of the whole thing.

00:25:19.350 --> 00:25:22.840
There's nothing to fear.

00:25:22.840 --> 00:25:27.900
Your Father, He is compassion, He's ocean
of compassion.

00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:34.649
And He's ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.

00:25:34.649 --> 00:25:42.769
And He is now within you.

00:25:42.769 --> 00:25:46.250
Who is more powerful than Him?

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.840
It's very easy for many human beings to say,
"Oh, we don't believe in God."

00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:53.690
You believe it or not, He's there.

00:25:53.690 --> 00:26:00.100
Those who say, "We don't believe," it is better
that they should come and get their realization

00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:07.950
and understand that there is very little time
left for such kind of nonsensical statements.

00:26:07.950 --> 00:26:15.380
I mean you can at the most say that, "I've
not felt God so far and I'm open, if I feel."

00:26:15.380 --> 00:26:20.970
But on what basis do you deny?

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:27.779
What basis have you got to say that, "We don't
believe in God"?

00:26:27.779 --> 00:26:35.929
Not only, after realization you can prove
God, but you can show His miracles.

00:26:35.929 --> 00:26:42.700
The second thing, the nature of Spirit is
that He's chitta, He's the attention.

00:26:42.700 --> 00:26:51.059
He's the attention means when you become spiritually
enlightened your attention becomes enlightened.

00:26:51.059 --> 00:26:58.010
Now enlightenment, what we understand of these
lights is that the lights are falling here,

00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:02.360
and we can see things, that's all.

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:15.669
But this attention which is being enlightened,
acts, it works, it has got loops, it has got

00:27:15.669 --> 00:27:18.480
weapons, it works.

00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:26.570
You have to see for yourself how your attention
works.

00:27:26.570 --> 00:27:35.789
Today there was somebody who went and told
one of the Sahaj yginis that "I was sitting

00:27:35.789 --> 00:27:40.760
there and I was getting all negative thoughts
and was feeling horrible in my hands and I

00:27:40.760 --> 00:27:43.860
don't know why it was happening in the program."

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:52.950
So she said, "Here you have come to pay attention
to Mother and to Her work and pay attention

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:54.360
to your Spirit.

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:59.929
But if you are paying attention to all the
rest of the people here, then you are going

00:27:59.929 --> 00:28:01.679
to catch them."

00:28:01.679 --> 00:28:06.840
Is a very simple thing, "Where is your attention?"

00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:07.840
Ask this question.

00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:12.690
This is a very common question in an Indian
home, a mother will ask the child, "Where

00:28:12.690 --> 00:28:14.169
is your attention?"

00:28:14.169 --> 00:28:23.580
The basis of Indian life is chitta nirodh,
is to fix your attention in a proper way.

00:28:23.580 --> 00:28:28.100
Where is your attention?

00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:30.010
Is it on your Spirit?

00:28:30.010 --> 00:28:37.420
Or is it on somebody else, like, "My brother
is sitting here, my mother is sitting there,

00:28:37.420 --> 00:28:42.710
oh, that woman is very bad, she's jealous
of me," all this nonsense.

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:46.080
Where is your attention?

00:28:46.080 --> 00:28:54.830
When you get realized then you start seeing
through the window of the Spirit, your position

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:55.830
changes.

00:28:55.830 --> 00:29:04.899
As you're looking at Me now, then you come
back here and start looking at you this way.

00:29:04.899 --> 00:29:15.870
Till you are realized you are sitting before
Me, but once you are realized you come here

00:29:15.870 --> 00:29:20.049
and see others from there, that's your fort.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:22.799
Nobody can touch you there.

00:29:22.799 --> 00:29:30.309
From there you see others, your attention
is detached.

00:29:30.309 --> 00:29:37.020
So the attention becomes enlightened after
realization.

00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.590
You pay attention to anything, it works.

00:29:38.590 --> 00:29:43.300
It does work, no doubt, you try.

00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:48.679
Those who have got realization should try
this.

00:29:48.679 --> 00:29:54.100
Try your attention, but attention has to be
pure.

00:29:54.100 --> 00:30:01.850
You have to purify your attention, and the
best way to purify it is to keep your Agnya

00:30:01.850 --> 00:30:03.830
Chakra open.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:08.749
When this centre is open which is the centre
of Christ, which I have shown that it can

00:30:08.749 --> 00:30:14.179
only open through the Lord's Prayer after
realization.

00:30:14.179 --> 00:30:26.020
When you open that, then you are in that state
where your attention is divine.

00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:35.140
And you'll be amazed how things work out,
even the smallest things, the material things,

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:42.990
the useless things and the great things, and
the subtle and subtlest, and how you start

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.510
growing.

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:53.740
So the growth is to be achieved by purifying
your attention, and to purify this attention

00:30:53.740 --> 00:31:01.230
is to keep your Agnya Chakra open and be in
thoughtless awareness.

00:31:01.230 --> 00:31:03.899
You watch something, you don't think about
it.

00:31:03.899 --> 00:31:09.080
Zen said the same thing but I think people
didn't understand, you see, before realization

00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:11.740
it's like telling about colors to a blind
man.

00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:18.570
Zen said the same thing, you watch a thing
without thinking about it.

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:23.899
They created patterns which didn't mean anything,
which you see it without thinking.

00:31:23.899 --> 00:31:28.220
But that's only possible after realization.

00:31:28.220 --> 00:31:35.120
So the thinking process minimizes and you
start witnessing.

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:44.610
The higher state than that of attention is
that you jump into nirvikalpa samadhi, into

00:31:44.610 --> 00:31:47.980
the state of doubtless awareness.

00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:53.119
Now it is not doubtlessness because you've
argued it out or anything.

00:31:53.119 --> 00:31:58.679
But is a state where you're doubtless about
things.

00:31:58.679 --> 00:32:03.019
I mean the way you speak, the way you behave,
the way your attention is, you can make it

00:32:03.019 --> 00:32:09.169
out that "I'm doubtlessly there."

00:32:09.169 --> 00:32:15.919
The discrimination becomes so sharp that you
can just say, "This is so and so and so,"

00:32:15.919 --> 00:32:18.020
there's no fanaticism about it.

00:32:18.020 --> 00:32:26.880
As I told you this morning that if a blind
man cross over something and says, "Oh there's

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:33.509
a snake here," and he believes it's a snake,
he believes that it's a snake, that's fanaticism.

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:38.980
Because he has no eyes to see and he believes
it's a snake, he says, "Oh, there is a snake

00:32:38.980 --> 00:32:40.330
here, I believe!"

00:32:40.330 --> 00:32:45.320
But a person who has eyes sees, "No it's a
rope, it's just a rope."

00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.210
And he says, "No, it's not, it's a rope."

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:54.850
But he has eyes and when he says with his
eyes, which can see that, that it's a rope,

00:32:54.850 --> 00:33:00.149
he means it, the truth - then he's not a fanatic.

00:33:00.149 --> 00:33:03.280
But he's standing on the truth.

00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:09.660
This subtle difference people don't understand.

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:19.539
Fanaticism comes through blindness and the
truth comes through realization.

00:33:19.539 --> 00:33:25.280
And at any cost you'll not give up the truth,
any cost.

00:33:25.280 --> 00:33:33.850
Now when I started My work in 1970, somehow
I knew all about these fake gurus and fake

00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:36.129
people, I knew about it.

00:33:36.129 --> 00:33:43.960
And in My first lecture, we had about, must
be having about two, three thousand people,

00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:52.460
it was a very huge hall and I told the names
of all these fake people and who they were

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.960
in previous lives and what they did, by names.

00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:02.919
And everybody was amazed at Me, they were
frightened.

00:34:02.919 --> 00:34:06.899
There was a Maharajah who was a friend of
My husband and all that, and he came and told

00:34:06.899 --> 00:34:09.480
Me that, "Oh, I'm so...

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:12.060
I'm very frightened for you."

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.610
I said, "Why?"

00:34:13.610 --> 00:34:16.710
He said, "These people are horrid.

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:24.100
They mean money, they mean their whole earnings
out of it.

00:34:24.100 --> 00:34:28.280
How did you say these things openly and you
took their names?

00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:29.460
They will shoot you."

00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:30.460
I said, "Let them shoot.

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:32.270
I'll see who shoots Me."

00:34:32.270 --> 00:34:38.700
They said, "You see they will prosecute you."

00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:42.720
I said, "Let them prosecute."

00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:54.700
So many years have passed, nobody has dared
to say that I'm telling the lies.

00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.740
There is no fear.

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:03.150
You love, but you don't love satanic people,
you don't love Satan.

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:11.040
The Satan who has spoiled the Kundalini of
people, who has spoiled all the chances of

00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.540
their getting realization, as a mother do
you think I should say, "They are very good

00:35:15.540 --> 00:35:16.540
people"?

00:35:16.540 --> 00:35:23.440
I'm not a political figure and I'm not seeking
elections.

00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:27.250
Cannot be a compromise!

00:35:27.250 --> 00:35:30.020
That's what happens to you also.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:45.180
But by your own self-esteem, by your own glory,
people see, "Here is the leader."

00:35:45.180 --> 00:35:49.750
And you become the leader of the people.

00:35:49.750 --> 00:35:57.700
You can, there is nothing to be frightened
of.

00:35:57.700 --> 00:36:05.280
There should be no half-way, as Christ, as
he read it out to you, that lukewarm people

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:09.020
he spits them out of the mouth.

00:36:09.020 --> 00:36:17.130
If you are hot, if you are devils, we'll fight
you; if you are cold, you're my children.

00:36:17.130 --> 00:36:24.360
But lukewarm people are static, because all
kinds of forces are pulling, there's no progress

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.570
of any kind.

00:36:25.570 --> 00:36:34.030
You come, you come, negative, positive, they
are pulled this way, that way.

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:38.900
There cannot be compromise with truth.

00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:48.740
And then you will see you will have the real
collective force, the real blessings of God,

00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:52.280
in every way.

00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:57.110
You don't have to worry about money, you don't
have to worry about anything, it all works

00:36:57.110 --> 00:36:59.840
out, everything works out.

00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:05.450
You can't believe it how much it works out.

00:37:05.450 --> 00:37:12.810
I will tell you about these Australians: Australians
were finding it very difficult to get a place

00:37:12.810 --> 00:37:21.670
to have an ashram, and one day, frantically
one of the girls telephoned to Me, "Mother,

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:25.760
we cannot have a place now, we don't know
where to go, we have sold our houses, we've

00:37:25.760 --> 00:37:26.970
no place to go to."

00:37:26.970 --> 00:37:29.170
I said, "Don't you worry, tomorrow, you'll
get it."

00:37:29.170 --> 00:37:34.490
And she was surprised how I told her, "Tomorrow
you'll get it."

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:40.690
After telephoning and all that, she went home
and she received a call...

00:37:40.690 --> 00:37:45.380
I mean there was a call from a... estate agent.

00:37:45.380 --> 00:37:54.080
When they went to see him next day he said,
"There's an ashram available, would you like

00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:55.080
to have it?"

00:37:55.080 --> 00:38:00.880
At a very cheap rate, they got a beautiful
house for the ashram.

00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:06.540
In London, we had a some sort of a small ashram
and they were finding it very difficult for

00:38:06.540 --> 00:38:09.310
all these people to live there, because they
wanted to live together.

00:38:09.310 --> 00:38:14.910
They said, "Mother, we must have some more
rooms and some more place."

00:38:14.910 --> 00:38:18.570
I said, "All right you just pray, it will
work out."

00:38:18.570 --> 00:38:23.780
You won't believe, we had started a co-op
in London, and they said it will take eight

00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:25.500
years to get a room out of this co-op.

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:29.220
That's London speed, just the opposite of
American.

00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:38.120
And within a month's time, we got a huge house,
huge house with fifteen bedrooms and two big

00:38:38.120 --> 00:38:45.120
halls and we didn't know what to do with it,
and at such a cheap rate that for the whole

00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:48.450
week, only seventy pounds were to be paid.

00:38:48.450 --> 00:38:54.900
But then the Sahaj yogis went and settled
down there because in London we have in thousands.

00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.860
Then they said, "Mother what about for others?"

00:38:57.860 --> 00:39:09.730
And within fifteen days we got a huge big
hotel with all carpets and with all curtains

00:39:09.730 --> 00:39:18.160
and everything provided for, cutlery, crockery,
anything you say was there.

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:28.490
Every thing - only for ninety pounds a week,
for at least twenty people to live very happily

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.250
and big rooms each and big halls.

00:39:32.250 --> 00:39:37.090
Just we got it.

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:41.450
You won't believe but it has happened just
before Warren's marriage and we didn't know

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:45.900
where they are going to stay, all of these
who were coming to get married here, and they

00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:49.890
had a nice honeymoon in that hotel.

00:39:49.890 --> 00:39:52.030
They didn't have to pay anything for it.

00:39:52.030 --> 00:39:54.130
Yes, it works out.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:57.280
Krishna has said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.170
You get to your yoga first, he never said,
"Kshema yoga," he said, "Yoga kshema vahamyaham."

00:40:03.170 --> 00:40:07.670
You get your realization, you get your yoga
and then the kshema, the well-being works

00:40:07.670 --> 00:40:11.580
out.

00:40:11.580 --> 00:40:17.720
Everything is organized then for you, you
are on the stage, everyone works for you,

00:40:17.720 --> 00:40:21.040
believe Me, it happens that way.

00:40:21.040 --> 00:40:26.040
What is there to hanker after, what is there
to ask for, I mean you ask for one thing,

00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:31.220
you get thousand, you don't know what to do
with them.

00:40:31.220 --> 00:40:35.880
I don't know really- I don't know with Myself,
I don't know what to do , the way, I'm quite

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:43.930
generous, I mean I try to give away so many
things but still My house, oh God!

00:40:43.930 --> 00:40:47.020
You can't imagine, you can't imagine.

00:40:47.020 --> 00:40:53.520
In their wedding I gave fifty-one saris, fifty-one,
thinking that, "Now I'll some rest from these

00:40:53.520 --> 00:40:54.520
saris."

00:40:54.520 --> 00:40:56.240
Again I went back, they are still there.

00:40:56.240 --> 00:41:02.540
I don't know now what am I to do, I brought
now some to America to give away and all that,

00:41:02.540 --> 00:41:12.150
you just give and you get, everything, you
get fed-up!

00:41:12.150 --> 00:41:20.640
But only thing that I always, I have been
asking for are the seekers, where are they

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.650
lost?

00:41:21.650 --> 00:41:24.690
Where are they?

00:41:24.690 --> 00:41:31.550
That's something still there, they are to
be saved.

00:41:31.550 --> 00:41:38.350
Because as I told you Christ is going to come
back with eleven destructive powers and there's

00:41:38.350 --> 00:41:45.010
going to be no questioning, no realization,
just...

00:41:45.010 --> 00:41:52.740
All the negative forces will be killed and
those who enter into the kingdom of God will

00:41:52.740 --> 00:42:04.870
reside in the kingdom of God, will reside
there, the residents, the citizens.

00:42:04.870 --> 00:42:12.550
As He said, "If you want money, I'll give
you gold.

00:42:12.550 --> 00:42:19.240
But I look after those who hanker after Spirit."

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:27.200
You enter through the door and He eats with
you, He shares with you.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:35.180
For a realized soul the highest human beings
are the seekers.

00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:42.290
You may be any king or anything, what does
it matter, there are so many roaming about.

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:49.270
But a seeker is the thing in the eyes of God
as the highest human being, who has to become

00:42:49.270 --> 00:42:51.350
a super-human being.

00:42:51.350 --> 00:43:04.350
So your attention is filled, so many of these
miracles, you cannot imagine how many have

00:43:04.350 --> 00:43:06.820
taken place with Sahaj yogis.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:11.260
One can write such a big book.

00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:16.380
So the attention becomes pure.

00:43:16.380 --> 00:43:21.250
You just can't see bad things happening, I
mean, you just don't like it, I mean, I feel

00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:25.290
like vomiting sometimes the way things are,
sometimes.

00:43:25.290 --> 00:43:35.540
The things that you enjoy normally become
absolutely garbage, you just don't like it,

00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:40.080
the whole, the priorities change.

00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:46.830
You become automatically virtuous, I don't
have to tell you, "Be virtuous," you'll just

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:51.710
become, and you start enjoying your virtues
and virtues of others.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:44:01.070
You start enjoying other people because attention
becomes collectively conscious.

00:44:01.070 --> 00:44:07.940
Our central nervous system is our attention
but this central nervous system becomes collectively

00:44:07.940 --> 00:44:15.080
conscious, becomes.

00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.590
You are not bothered; somebody has cancer,
it's all right, "I'll try to cure you."

00:44:20.590 --> 00:44:25.070
You are not afraid you'll get cancer, nothing,
you are never afraid of it.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:28.200
"I'll try."

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:31.070
You put your hands like this, like that and
the fellow says, "Oh I'm feeling very much

00:44:31.070 --> 00:44:35.380
better, I don't know, what have you done to
me?"

00:44:35.380 --> 00:44:36.380
"Nothing."

00:44:36.380 --> 00:44:46.110
The attention becomes so effective, so powerful;
it does tremendous things and the attention

00:44:46.110 --> 00:44:51.290
among yourselves has a rapport.

00:44:51.290 --> 00:45:02.140
They all move like the several drops in an
ocean, in a wave of love, it's so beautiful.

00:45:02.140 --> 00:45:10.580
The white men came to India long time back
as this or that, but when they came with Me,

00:45:10.580 --> 00:45:18.060
you should see, we have some films how the
Indian villagers, you see, took them to their

00:45:18.060 --> 00:45:25.830
heart, danced with them, fed them, loved them,
it's so sweet.

00:45:25.830 --> 00:45:31.010
And they write to them, it's so beautiful,
there's no artificial, it's not just a feeling,

00:45:31.010 --> 00:45:36.020
"I love you, you love me," it's not there.

00:45:36.020 --> 00:45:41.850
It's just the enjoyment of the company of
other realized souls.

00:45:41.850 --> 00:45:49.850
We talk of big things, "Oh, we are all brothers
and sisters," it's all talk, talk, talk, talk,

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:50.850
talk.

00:45:50.850 --> 00:45:56.980
Then you just become, you forget your color,
you forget your nationality, you forget everything,

00:45:56.980 --> 00:46:02.610
you just feel, "Oh, thats a Sahaj yogi."

00:46:02.610 --> 00:46:09.800
It's a very different plane into which you
arrive where you feel so happy, joyous, the

00:46:09.800 --> 00:46:14.100
whole thing is a fun.

00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:17.750
And when it comes to helping, all of them
come together.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:22.870
When they find a negative force is coming,
all of them come together.

00:46:22.870 --> 00:46:26.890
There is never a discussion among them, never.

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.040
They try to pull him out.

00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:32.790
They tell him, all of them will tell by their
own ways and method that, "This is wrong,

00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:34.040
this is wrong."

00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.330
It's such a combination, I never have to tell
them.

00:46:37.330 --> 00:46:41.580
I don't have to tell them that, "I'll give
you some lessons now," for example, "How to

00:46:41.580 --> 00:46:45.720
carry on among yourselves," nothing, they
just manage.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:51.680
Not only that but a person will say, "Now
see," A will say to B, "See I'm catching on

00:46:51.680 --> 00:46:53.810
my Agnya, will you please help me there."

00:46:53.810 --> 00:46:56.530
That means, "I'm ego."

00:46:56.530 --> 00:46:59.180
And the other fellow he'll say, "I'll...

00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.180
I'll try."

00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:06.540
They just help each other, without feeling
bad, there is no remorse of anything, there's

00:47:06.540 --> 00:47:11.900
no heart burning, no jealousy.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:18.040
What a relationship is established like one
finger doesn't have jealousy with the other.

00:47:18.040 --> 00:47:25.150
You have no jealousies with the other cells
of the same primordial being.

00:47:25.150 --> 00:47:28.990
There is no need even to talk of love, you
are in love.

00:47:28.990 --> 00:47:31.300
Everybody can see that your love.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:44.760
It's really worth seeing how we become so
much adaptable, so much silent and happy people,

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:52.630
when our attention becomes collectively conscious,
because that's the real source of joy.

00:47:52.630 --> 00:48:01.830
And the greatest quality of the sSirit is
that you're pure joy.

00:48:01.830 --> 00:48:03.830
It's pure joy.

00:48:03.830 --> 00:48:11.620
We talk of unhappiness and happiness, sorrow
and ecstasy and all these words.

00:48:11.620 --> 00:48:22.050
But joy is pure, it hasn't got the duality,
it's one, single, absolute.

00:48:22.050 --> 00:48:30.440
I'm leaving you and My heart is wrenching.

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:36.100
The joy is seeing that.

00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:42.070
Seeing that this Nirmala is wrenching, bleeding.

00:48:42.070 --> 00:48:57.110
The joy is seeing and when I go, this feeling,
I will think and I'll think of you and the

00:48:57.110 --> 00:48:59.630
joy will be again repeated.

00:48:59.630 --> 00:49:08.720
That joy of oneness, even in separation the
oneness I feel it, the concern.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:20.780
Which cannot be expressed in words, that silent
pulling of your heart - that is also joy.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:31.590
Joy is absolute, it comes through seeing.

00:49:31.590 --> 00:49:38.230
You see it and you get the joy.

00:49:38.230 --> 00:49:46.960
Joy is the quality when you gradually move
from the brain, the attention first goes into

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:52.830
the brain, specially in the West, is the brain
first, takes place, means you become the attention,

00:49:52.830 --> 00:49:56.020
I'm sorry, you become the truth.

00:49:56.020 --> 00:50:01.540
Means you start feeling in the hands, you
understand, then you see, "Yes, it is so and

00:50:01.540 --> 00:50:06.100
this person has got this trouble, so he must
be having arthritis if he's catching on this,

00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:07.100
yes true."

00:50:07.100 --> 00:50:13.470
You start tallying, finding out and monitoring
it and again, again verifying it and you are

00:50:13.470 --> 00:50:14.590
satisfied with it.

00:50:14.590 --> 00:50:27.580
So the attention first is nothing but starts
achieving the truth.

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:39.400
It's trying to feel the truth but it's dry,
at that stage, it'sdry - in the West, specially,

00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:42.900
because we are differently made in the West.

00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:48.980
Then we read the book, "Advent," we like it
and we see all these things and knowledge

00:50:48.980 --> 00:50:54.610
and everything you like, you want to listen
to the t- My speech and all that.

00:50:54.610 --> 00:50:58.810
You all like it.

00:50:58.810 --> 00:51:05.500
Is the knowledge because you see the truth,
the knowledge - that's the gift of the brain.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:11.290
Is the central path as I can say "the awareness."

00:51:11.290 --> 00:51:17.860
Then you feel your chitta, your attention
which is enlightened, and you're blasted with

00:51:17.860 --> 00:51:18.860
it.

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:22.590
You see the miracles happening, "That's happening..."

00:51:22.590 --> 00:51:25.220
you are just blasted.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:34.060
Then the third thing happens; is the joy:
that you are in joy all the time.

00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:45.370
You cannot keep serious for more than two
minutes; it's very difficult to keep serious.

00:51:45.370 --> 00:51:53.190
The sense of humor is so beautiful, you never
use vulgarity or hurting things or personal

00:51:53.190 --> 00:51:57.370
remarks, but the whole thing is so beautiful.

00:51:57.370 --> 00:52:08.540
When you speak, people feel the flowers throwing
their fragrance at you.

00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:14.090
Every action that you do creates joy, ripple
of joy.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:23.480
Every movement you do, every vision you see,
gives you joy.

00:52:23.480 --> 00:52:29.260
That time you feel perfected.

00:52:29.260 --> 00:52:37.100
When you see a picture which is beautiful,
immediately you go into thoughtless awareness,

00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:44.310
and the complete joy of that creation starts
dropping on you, you just feel the joy.

00:52:44.310 --> 00:52:48.560
Then you become silent, you don't speak...

00:52:48.560 --> 00:53:01.050
much, you don't think, you become the joy,
ananda.

00:53:01.050 --> 00:53:08.200
That's the perfect state in which you should
be.

00:53:08.200 --> 00:53:15.310
It's so beautiful that you want to be there
all the time.

00:53:15.310 --> 00:53:30.350
This joy is the movement of your ocean of
love.

00:53:30.350 --> 00:53:40.520
Is the beautiful movement of the clouds that
you see.

00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:51.220
It's fantastic, you just get drenched into
it and you do everything for love's sake and

00:53:51.220 --> 00:53:56.410
you don't think you're doing it for love's
sake, you do not feel that way, you just do

00:53:56.410 --> 00:54:01.820
it because it's so joy-giving, that it is
the greatest thing.

00:54:01.820 --> 00:54:08.470
You may have... anything in the world will
not be that much joy-giving as this joy of

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:11.490
the Spirit which you become.

00:54:11.490 --> 00:54:15.100
You never feel lonely, you are never bored.

00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:23.690
Whether you are alone or with anyone, you
are in joy.

00:54:23.690 --> 00:54:29.830
One should understand that if you get your
Self-realization or if somebody says that

00:54:29.830 --> 00:54:35.010
they are giving you to some positive lines,
you should know, "Are you peaceful within

00:54:35.010 --> 00:54:36.010
you?

00:54:36.010 --> 00:54:39.100
Are you joy?"

00:54:39.100 --> 00:54:50.730
Forget about the collective consciousness,
is your health all right?

00:54:50.730 --> 00:54:54.760
That's the minimum of minimum.

00:54:54.760 --> 00:55:00.640
The whole system changes.

00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:07.200
I just say that all of you should achieve
that state of joy by the time I come here

00:55:07.200 --> 00:55:11.060
next year.

00:55:11.060 --> 00:55:19.290
And I hope you grow into it, by taking up
a stand on the truth, grow into it.

00:55:19.290 --> 00:55:23.900
You progress into it.

00:55:23.900 --> 00:55:31.080
It's so wonderful and so beautiful and that's
what your Father wants you to have.

00:55:31.080 --> 00:55:37.230
He's the most generous Father; He can't enjoy
His kingdom unless and until He has given

00:55:37.230 --> 00:55:41.970
it to you, that He has made you sit on His
throne.

00:55:41.970 --> 00:55:51.280
That's the greatest joy that He wants to have
and that's what you should achieve, that's

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:58.970
what you should have, that's your right to
have.

00:55:58.970 --> 00:56:08.060
This is what is Self-realization - you become
just the master.

00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:14.380
You don't have to consult anyone, you know
it.

00:56:14.380 --> 00:56:26.640
You have to just consult your Spirit through
your vibratory awareness, and you know it.

00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:33.870
These are the blessings of Self-realization
into which you have to grow and as you grow

00:56:33.870 --> 00:56:41.320
you start manifesting your powers: you can
raise the Kundalini, you can give realization

00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:44.720
at the very outset.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:49.300
Imagine the Kundalini moves under your finger,
nobody can believe it but it has happened

00:56:49.300 --> 00:56:51.610
now.

00:56:51.610 --> 00:56:57.510
Even very, very great saints, you see, there
is a very great saint who is more than hundred

00:56:57.510 --> 00:57:06.030
and eight years of age, and he asked Me, "Mother,
I have spent thousands of years to get these

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.530
vibrations and these people have got it without
doing anything."

00:57:09.530 --> 00:57:15.190
I said, "What did you... why did you do it,
who asked you to do it?

00:57:15.190 --> 00:57:17.960
You should have taken it easy, you would have
got it."

00:57:17.960 --> 00:57:27.210
He's a very sweet fellow, but because he's
got it through his effort, see he has that

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.380
feeling that, "I've got it through my effort."

00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:31.690
You'll never get it through effort, I tell
you.

00:57:31.690 --> 00:57:35.110
When you are finished with your effort you
just get it...

00:57:35.110 --> 00:57:37.830
[murmurs of laughter from the Audience.]

00:57:37.830 --> 00:57:41.910
Shri Mataji: ...maybe in an abstract way,
or maybe-

00:57:41.910 --> 00:57:42.910
Yes!

00:57:42.910 --> 00:57:50.400
When Buddha was tired, finished, fagged-out,
then he got his realization.

00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.810
When you stop your efforts then only you will
get your realization.

00:57:53.810 --> 00:57:57.130
"So why to boast of your efforts?"

00:57:57.130 --> 00:57:59.230
I told him.

00:57:59.230 --> 00:58:05.960
He's a very powerful man because he's done
lots of things and he always goes on a big,

00:58:05.960 --> 00:58:13.820
very big tiger and because he's hurt himself,
he says that people have beaten him, so he's

00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:21.510
hurt himself so he always uses a tiger.

00:58:21.510 --> 00:58:25.830
And he's a man with the idea that he has these
powers, that powers.

00:58:25.830 --> 00:58:30.460
So when I went to see him, I knew that time
because he told people that, "Mother has come,

00:58:30.460 --> 00:58:34.900
so you go and see Her..." and all that and
I knew he was there so I went to see him.

00:58:34.900 --> 00:58:41.780
When I went to see him, we had to climb about
three miles, one had to walk up, and I was

00:58:41.780 --> 00:58:47.380
walking up and when I reached there it was
raining and I got completely drenched.

00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:52.650
And this fellow is supposed have powers over
the rain.

00:58:52.650 --> 00:59:00.930
And he was so angry when I went there he was
sitting on a little seat of his made of some

00:59:00.930 --> 00:59:01.930
stone.

00:59:01.930 --> 00:59:05.080
He was doing like this, like this, very angry.

00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:10.270
So I didn't say anything, I went inside his
cave and sat down there in that drenched condition.

00:59:10.270 --> 00:59:18.560
So he came down and he said, "Mother, did
you do this to kill my ego?"

00:59:18.560 --> 00:59:19.560
I said, "What?

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:20.620
I didn't do anything.

00:59:20.620 --> 00:59:22.620
What did I do?"

00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:26.630
He said, "This rain wouldn't listen to me."

00:59:26.630 --> 00:59:31.650
I said, "Now, don't be angry," I said, "Sit
down.

00:59:31.650 --> 00:59:38.300
Haven't you bought a sari for Me, and you
are a sanyasi, I won't take a sari from a

00:59:38.300 --> 00:59:39.300
sanyasi, [son?].

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:41.410
You have got a sari for Me, isn't it?

00:59:41.410 --> 00:59:43.660
So I have to get drenched, otherwise I will
not take sari from you."

00:59:43.660 --> 00:59:50.750
And the whole temper melted away, whole temper
melted away.

00:59:50.750 --> 00:59:57.290
Then I said, "It was necessary the water to
flow over My body so that all the plains around

00:59:57.290 --> 01:00:04.120
you becomes beautiful, is vibrated with water."

01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:10.000
But he is a very great soul I must say, because
he doesn't talk to Me like ordinary human

01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.390
beings talk.

01:00:11.390 --> 01:00:18.310
His style is different because he recognizes,
he knows who I am.

01:00:18.310 --> 01:00:25.730
Is a very different thing, and a day will
come when you will also rise, you will rise

01:00:25.730 --> 01:00:39.180
and grow and grow and there will see the glory
of this great new age, new generation...

01:00:39.180 --> 01:00:46.410
into the complete newness of the being.

01:00:46.410 --> 01:00:51.690
Today I was going to tell you about certain
diseases that one has and how to control them

01:00:51.690 --> 01:00:59.680
and I would suggest that we have a book - are
you going to sell it to everyone?

01:00:59.680 --> 01:01:02.530
Yogi from the side: There's a few of them
Mother.

01:01:02.530 --> 01:01:05.910
Shri Mataji: We don't have many.

01:01:05.910 --> 01:01:11.550
So we would say those who have been coming
for all the four lectures should buy the book.

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:19.500
We are sorry we don't have many books but
we hope to send you these books later on and

01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:25.510
is a very good book in which you can see what
imbalances can work out, like how you get

01:01:25.510 --> 01:01:31.050
diabetes, how you get kidney trouble, blood
pressure and then how you have to balance

01:01:31.050 --> 01:01:42.180
your liver, and how to look after the security
and all these things are written in that book

01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:43.180
at length.

01:01:43.180 --> 01:01:47.210
Quite a knowledgeable book I should say.

01:01:47.210 --> 01:01:52.730
I took the writer...

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:56.040
I should say I really tortured him.

01:01:56.040 --> 01:02:02.700
And everyday I used to see him coming up pulling
his ears, you see, that, "I don't know what

01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:04.550
mistakes I'm going to do."

01:02:04.550 --> 01:02:11.160
And every time he would come, I would say,
"Now, Gregoire you have to be sweet as well.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:16.930
It's not that sweet, you are still a scholar,
you have to be a Sahaj yogi.

01:02:16.930 --> 01:02:22.460
And a Sahaj yogi is different from a scholar
so you write this book in such a manner, in

01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:31.690
such a way that it is sweet, it's loving,
it's kind," and I've tried really to curb

01:02:31.690 --> 01:02:34.780
it down, curb it down.

01:02:34.780 --> 01:02:43.271
But he had written two chapters of his scholarliness,
all the scholarliness that he had, and it

01:02:43.271 --> 01:02:50.880
was like a... really a big boulder before
you when you enter into that book.

01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:52.190
So one day I told him.

01:02:52.190 --> 01:02:57.790
"These two chapters, let us put it at the
end of the book," and he really collapsed.

01:02:57.790 --> 01:03:03.580
He said, "Mother, how can You do that to me,
it's too much."

01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:06.670
I said, "But why, what's the problem?"

01:03:06.670 --> 01:03:11.680
He said, "These two chapters are the ones
which introduce the book and how can we do

01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:12.680
it?

01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:15.340
I mean, it's in the beginning and how can
You put it at the end?"

01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:21.170
I said, "Gregoire, while correcting the book,
I saw to it that these chapters have nothing

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:29.970
to do with the beginning, so you put them
at the end."

01:03:29.970 --> 01:03:34.750
And he, when he placed them there he said,
"Oh the book has become wonderful."

01:03:34.750 --> 01:03:39.400
And then he told Me, "It's a very good play
of Mother in this, that the intellectuals

01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:46.000
are never satisfied with the reading once,
and they would like to go into the intellectual

01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:48.520
rumination.

01:03:48.520 --> 01:03:54.330
Like the animals you see, like cows when they
eat, then they take it back and again eat

01:03:54.330 --> 01:03:59.290
it, like that, So is better to put these two
chapters for them."

01:03:59.290 --> 01:04:01.110
I said, "Now you are not angry with Me?"

01:04:01.110 --> 01:04:03.490
He said, "No, this is a very good thing."

01:04:03.490 --> 01:04:08.960
But these two chapters definitely prove that
he's a very learned man.

01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:12.250
And I told him, "Gregoire, when did you read
all these books that you have quoted?"

01:04:12.250 --> 01:04:16.799
He said, "Mother, you'll be surprised, these
quotations just came to me...

01:04:16.799 --> 01:04:19.110
I never, I never read them."

01:04:19.110 --> 01:04:20.110
I said, "You never read them?"

01:04:20.110 --> 01:04:25.130
"Yes, yes, I had read them before, sometimes
I must have read them, but at the right time,

01:04:25.130 --> 01:04:29.290
I got the right quotation."

01:04:29.290 --> 01:04:35.690
He's now coming to Los Angeles, he is a diplomat
in the Swiss government and he's coming all

01:04:35.690 --> 01:04:45.680
the way from Rome to Los Angeles, and he's
a very dynamic person, I'm looking forward

01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.880
to My visit to Los Angeles.

01:04:46.880 --> 01:04:53.720
If you have any friends there or anything
you can write to them, you can take the address

01:04:53.720 --> 01:04:56.280
from here so that they can come and see Me.

01:04:56.280 --> 01:05:02.300
We have now booked all our days, I am sorry
and still we'll contact somebody from Unity

01:05:02.300 --> 01:05:04.840
Church, but all the days are booked.

01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:12.830
It's all right, and the people can come in
any case wherever you have the programs.

01:05:12.830 --> 01:05:16.700
Anything else you want you can write to Me.

01:05:16.700 --> 01:05:24.330
I'm sorry I can't write to you because every
day I work, like this the way I've been working

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:30.950
here: morning, the workshop, evening, the
lecture.

01:05:30.950 --> 01:05:34.450
It has been on and on for years together now.

01:05:34.450 --> 01:05:40.790
So, I do write sometimes, but I don't have
so much time, but somebody will answer you.

01:05:40.790 --> 01:05:46.420
Any question, any problem, anything, please
write to Me.

01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:52.960
I'll be very happy to receive letters from
you and there are so many people who are sorting

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:58.340
them out and looking after it, so you will
have an answer no doubt.

01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:04.970
Please get My address also from the ashram
address from these people.

01:06:04.970 --> 01:06:09.180
Anything that you want you can ask for it.

01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:14.860
Even sitting down here I know your attention,
it will work out.

01:06:14.860 --> 01:06:22.220
Gradually you will change and your asking
will be different and different and different.

01:06:22.220 --> 01:06:34.070
May God bless you to blossom into the beauties
of your Spirit, so that you glorify your Father

01:06:34.070 --> 01:06:41.870
and He feels glorified with His gracious love
towards you.

01:06:41.870 --> 01:06:47.090
Thank you very much.

01:06:47.090 --> 01:06:52.960
Today, if you want you can just put your hands,
if you had put your hands you would have got

01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.480
the vibrations.

01:06:54.480 --> 01:07:04.300
I am sure there are some new people today
and they should also feel their vibrations

01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:08.490
on top of their heads; they might be feeling
already the Cool Breeze, just take out your

01:07:08.490 --> 01:07:13.410
shoes and you'll feel it.

01:07:13.410 --> 01:07:24.620
On top of your head.

01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:29.930
The tapes are with the Unity Church here,
you can buy them.

01:07:29.930 --> 01:07:32.140
We have also sending twenty one tapes.

01:07:32.140 --> 01:07:34.390
[Warren next to Shri Mataji]: They're already
being copied.

01:07:34.390 --> 01:07:36.590
[Shri Mataji]: They are being copied.

01:07:36.590 --> 01:07:46.110
We have so many tapes in London and you can
buy from the gentleman, we don't have to bother

01:07:46.110 --> 01:07:48.900
about money part, I mean, we are not bothered.

01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:55.720
Only thing, as he must, they must have told
you, a little problem with our trustees, that

01:07:55.720 --> 01:07:58.440
you have to just say that we have the copyright,
that's all.

01:07:58.440 --> 01:08:03.070
We are not bothered as to what you charge
and what you do it.

01:08:03.070 --> 01:08:12.790
So you can buy the tapes as you like and you
can listen to them 

01:08:12.790 --> 01:08:13.790
and enjoy them.

01:08:13.790 --> 01:08:16.660
How many have come for the first time today?

01:08:16.660 --> 01:08:20.060
[Warren whispers]: Quite a few.

01:08:20.060 --> 01:08:24.029
[Shri Mataji]: Now just take out your shoes
please.

01:08:24.029 --> 01:08:28.270
[FV VIDEO ENDS 77 minutes]

01:08:28.270 --> 01:08:31.660
[edit] Transcript begins here

01:08:31.660 --> 01:08:37.830
Now today, on this day, I'm going to tell
you about the spirit.

01:08:37.830 --> 01:08:38.830
I've told you about the seven chakras, about
the three nadis, the three channels, that

01:08:38.830 --> 01:08:39.830
are within us.

01:08:39.830 --> 01:08:40.830
And today I want to tell you about the nature
of the spirit.

01:08:40.830 --> 01:08:42.100
The spirit resides in our heart.

01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:43.460
It's the reflection of God Almighty.

01:08:43.460 --> 01:08:45.900
In Sanskrit language, this aspect of God which
is all-pervading and is the first and the

01:08:45.900 --> 01:08:46.900
last, is called as Sadashiva, is the Father,
who does not incarnate.

01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.900
We say Yahova, we can say, or the God who
does not incarnate.

01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:48.900
This great aspect which encompasses everything
ultimately and also manifests everything,

01:08:48.900 --> 01:08:54.359
is the reflection within our heart as the
spirit.

01:08:54.359 --> 01:09:07.180
This aspect is just the witness aspect.

01:09:07.180 --> 01:09:11.420
It witnesses the play of its power, the Primordial
Power, the Holy Ghost, to see what is created

01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:12.420
by Her.

01:09:12.420 --> 01:09:13.420
He's the only enjoyer of the game.

01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:14.420
He sees the game, the Leela, the fun.

01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:15.850
She organises everything, it is She who gets
divided into three powers, it is She who creates

01:09:15.850 --> 01:09:20.870
the whole universe, it is She who gives us
this evolution, it is She who makes us human

01:09:20.870 --> 01:09:22.770
beings and it is She who has to make us the
higher human being.

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:26.810
That's the Holy Ghost, the Primordial Holy
Ghost and the reflection of that is this Kundalini

01:09:26.810 --> 01:09:28.280
within us.

01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:31.970
These two have to meet.

01:09:31.970 --> 01:09:33.440
They're separated.

01:09:33.440 --> 01:09:39.130
The spirit within you and the Holy Ghost within
you have to meet.

01:09:39.130 --> 01:09:40.130
That is the Yoga, that's the union.

01:09:40.130 --> 01:09:42.180
The seat of the spirit is on top of your head
here, but it resides in human beings in the

01:09:42.180 --> 01:09:47.490
heart; of course it comes out also and watches.

01:09:47.490 --> 01:09:56.411
It is not in our conscious minds, it resides
and watches the whole field.

01:09:56.411 --> 01:09:57.411
Infact, in Gita he is called as Kshettranjan,
the one who knows the field, the knower of

01:09:57.411 --> 01:09:58.411
the field.

01:09:58.411 --> 01:09:59.411
He knows everything, He watches; He's just
watching, where we go, what we do, what compromises

01:09:59.411 --> 01:10:00.411
we make, how we run after our seeking, how
we go to falsehood, what we do; everything

01:10:00.411 --> 01:10:01.411
it is watching.

01:10:01.411 --> 01:10:02.411
The Holy Ghost is the one which receives the
information and records everything in itself

01:10:02.411 --> 01:10:03.411
but the information is given by the deity
who is the seed of the spirit of Jesus Christ

01:10:03.411 --> 01:10:04.411
who is sitting down there, Ganesha.

01:10:04.411 --> 01:10:05.411
The spirit itself is Sat Chit Anand.

01:10:05.411 --> 01:10:06.411
He exists in the state of truth.

01:10:06.411 --> 01:10:07.411
Now we do not know what truth is.

01:10:07.411 --> 01:10:08.411
People say "God is Love, God is Truth."

01:10:08.411 --> 01:10:09.411
Now what is the truth?

01:10:09.411 --> 01:10:10.411
The truth is this all-pervading power.

01:10:10.411 --> 01:10:11.411
And this all-pervading power is the nature
of the spirit, which gives you the absolute

01:10:11.411 --> 01:10:12.411
knowledge; now mark this; absolute knowledge.

01:10:12.411 --> 01:10:13.411
For example, if you have to say what is the
shape of this, you'll say it's a pyramid.

01:10:13.411 --> 01:10:14.411
All right, but is it a good thing to have
a pyramid for a church or not.

01:10:14.411 --> 01:10:15.411
There could be hundred opinions on that.

01:10:15.411 --> 01:10:16.411
But if you ask Me, or ask any Sahaja Yogi,
they'll say, "yes, it has to be a pyramid."

01:10:16.411 --> 01:10:17.411
Why?

01:10:17.411 --> 01:10:18.411
Because in a pyramid there is a coefficient
and you'll feel the vibrations.

01:10:18.411 --> 01:10:19.411
It's absolutely, absolute knowledge.

01:10:19.411 --> 01:10:20.411
That's the truth you know.

01:10:20.411 --> 01:10:21.411
You want to know if a person is fake or not.

01:10:21.411 --> 01:10:22.411
You just put your hands like this and ask
the question, "Is he true?"

01:10:22.411 --> 01:10:23.411
Your vibrations will stop, you may even get
blisters, if you ask a question about it.

01:10:23.411 --> 01:10:24.411
So you do not know through your mental activity.

01:10:24.411 --> 01:10:25.411
A person may look very nice, as I told you,
he may behave in such a manner, that you'll

01:10:25.411 --> 01:10:26.411
say, "Oh, what a fine man he is."

01:10:26.411 --> 01:10:27.411
Is such and such person is a realised soul
or not?

01:10:27.411 --> 01:10:28.411
How will you know?

01:10:28.411 --> 01:10:29.411
You just put your hands towards that person
and you'll start getting the vibrations from

01:10:29.411 --> 01:10:30.411
that person; you'll enjoy them.

01:10:30.411 --> 01:10:31.770
Only after realisation only we can really
enjoy other persons, really enjoy.

01:10:31.770 --> 01:10:36.372
One day I was in Calcutta and staying in a
hotel, on My way to Singapore, and there was

01:10:36.372 --> 01:10:37.372
a very great soul who came to see Me.

01:10:37.372 --> 01:10:38.372
He just slipped into the room.

01:10:38.372 --> 01:10:41.520
See, sometimes it happens that some of these
great souls who live in the Himalayas and

01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:44.180
all that, they come in.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.390
And he just saw Me and he fell at my feet.

01:10:45.390 --> 01:10:46.560
And there at least five, six Sahaja Yogis
staying in other rooms and suddenly they felt

01:10:46.560 --> 01:10:47.560
tremendous cool joy falling on them.

01:10:47.560 --> 01:10:48.560
A cold shower, I think.

01:10:48.560 --> 01:10:49.560
And they all came running, one after another.

01:10:49.560 --> 01:10:50.560
"What happened, what happened?"

01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:51.560
And he was at My feet.

01:10:51.560 --> 01:10:52.560
They opened the door and they said, "Oh, Mother!"

01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:53.560
"How did you come?"

01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:54.560
"Oh, Mother!"

01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:55.560
And then they started feeling it.

01:10:55.560 --> 01:10:56.560
He was enjoying Me, I was enjoying him.

01:10:56.560 --> 01:10:57.560
And they were all enjoying him.

01:10:57.560 --> 01:10:58.560
You don't have to tell whether a person is
true or not.

01:10:58.560 --> 01:10:59.560
There is no mental deduction.

01:10:59.560 --> 01:11:00.560
It just happens.

01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:01.560
You start feeling, even children are like
that.

01:11:01.560 --> 01:11:02.560
Even poor children.

01:11:02.560 --> 01:11:03.560
If they're realised souls, immediately they'll
tell, this is this and this is this, finished.

01:11:03.560 --> 01:11:04.560
There's no compromise, how can you compromise.

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:05.560
That's what I told you yesterday that Christ
never compromised.

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:06.560
He never compromised.

01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:07.560
How can you compromise with darkness if you're
light?

01:11:07.560 --> 01:11:08.560
So the first thing you are, you are the truth.

01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.560
The spirit tells you what is the truth.

01:11:09.560 --> 01:11:10.560
It tells you everything about everything.

01:11:10.560 --> 01:11:11.560
It is the truth; the knowledge that is pure
is the truth.

01:11:11.560 --> 01:11:12.560
As I told you, Gavin Brown, when he got his
realisation, he said, "My father has not telephoned"

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:13.560
and he put his hands there and he got the
burning here and he telephoned, he found out

01:11:13.560 --> 01:11:14.560
that his father was downed with bronchitis,
and I told him exactly the same thing.

01:11:14.560 --> 01:11:15.560
Now a person who came to Me the other day
who had multiple sclerosis, is a very serious

01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:16.560
disease, according to doctors.

01:11:16.560 --> 01:11:17.560
But according to Me it is not.

01:11:17.560 --> 01:11:18.560
And everybody told Me the same centres were
catching.

01:11:18.560 --> 01:11:19.560
Of course because I have been in the medicine,
I have been in the medical college, I know

01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:20.560
this chakra means what.

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560
And he told Me that he had this problem.

01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.560
Even if he not told Me, I would have known
that he had this problem.

01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:23.560
Everybody will see the same centre is catching,
so you are the truth.

01:11:23.560 --> 01:11:24.560
Then after some time you cannot bear untruth.

01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:25.560
You cannot bear falsehood, I mean, we also
are like that, I tell you.

01:11:25.560 --> 01:11:26.560
For example, if I tell you that you come along
here, there's a very nice chair for you.

01:11:26.560 --> 01:11:27.560
Now you don't see any chair there.

01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:28.560
"Oh you sit down, you sit there, believe Me,
imagine there's a chair."

01:11:28.560 --> 01:11:29.560
Nobody will accept that, will you?

01:11:29.560 --> 01:11:30.560
"We don't see any chair."

01:11:30.560 --> 01:11:31.560
"There is a chair."

01:11:31.560 --> 01:11:32.560
"No, no, but imaginary, there is one, I have
placed it, you can't see it, I have made it

01:11:32.560 --> 01:11:33.560
invisible, you see.

01:11:33.560 --> 01:11:34.560
You just sit down on it."

01:11:34.560 --> 01:11:35.560
Alright you sit down, and you sit in that
position and after some time you start getting

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:36.560
the pain.

01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:37.560
Where's the chair, how do I get the pain.

01:11:37.560 --> 01:11:38.560
That's what Warren told you, it's very practical.

01:11:38.560 --> 01:11:39.560
You immediately know that this is not the
way.

01:11:39.560 --> 01:11:40.560
Now the first centre is very important, is
of the innocence, which gives you the magnetic

01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:41.560
power.

01:11:41.560 --> 01:11:42.560
In the sense not only that you are attractive
but, I mean you attract people, but magnetic

01:11:42.560 --> 01:11:43.560
means that you know whether you are moving
to the north or to the south.

01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:44.560
Birds have this power in them, birds have.

01:11:44.560 --> 01:11:45.560
That's how they fly from one place to another.

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:46.560
Because they can feel the magnet within.

01:11:46.560 --> 01:11:47.560
And the person who is pure at that point,
he never gets lost because he knows which

01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:48.560
side he's moving.

01:11:48.560 --> 01:11:49.560
I mean, I have, I have never had a problem
like that.

01:11:49.560 --> 01:11:50.560
I move either to the left or to the right,
or to forward.

01:11:50.560 --> 01:11:51.560
And My husband who is dealing with shipping,
he says, "I've never met a better navigator

01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:52.560
than my wife."

01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:53.560
And it's so spontaneous, I mean, I don't have
to think, I know for definite that you are

01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:54.560
moving in the wrong direction or in the right
direction.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:55.560
Even the material movement are (inaudible).

01:11:55.560 --> 01:11:56.560
All of them have it, even they're great drivers
and they have got all the maps and everything.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.560
And immediately I know that you are going
on the wrong direction because the magnet

01:11:57.560 --> 01:11:58.560
immediately turns round.

01:11:58.560 --> 01:11:59.560
So the magnet is placed within you there but
it is to be awakened.

01:11:59.560 --> 01:12:00.560
When it is awakened - these deities when they're
awakened - you become the truth, like the

01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:01.560
light that comes within, you start seeing
everything as far as your feelings are concerned,

01:12:01.560 --> 01:12:02.560
your experiencing is concerned.

01:12:02.560 --> 01:12:03.560
So you become the truth.

01:12:03.560 --> 01:12:04.560
Now one may say how truth could be love.

01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560
That's a very common question.

01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:06.560
Truth cannot be love because, I mean, if you
tell somebody something that is truth, he

01:12:06.560 --> 01:12:07.560
may not like, and he may be unhappy and it
may not be dear to him, and he might be very,

01:12:07.560 --> 01:12:08.560
very worried about it.

01:12:08.560 --> 01:12:09.560
Manu said long time back that you should speak
the truth and you must speak the things which

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.560
are dear to others.

01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:11.560
"Satyam vade, priyam vade."

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.560
People said it's not possible, it's an absurd
situation, how can you do it?

01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:13.560
So Krishna has put something in between, he
said, "Satyam vade, hitam vade, priyam vade."

01:12:13.560 --> 01:12:14.560
You say something that is the truth, always
say the truth, and, saying something, hitam

01:12:14.560 --> 01:12:15.560
means for the pleasing of the spirit.

01:12:15.560 --> 01:12:16.560
That's the condition.

01:12:16.560 --> 01:12:17.560
And ultimately that becomes a very dear thing.

01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:18.560
In the beginning one may not like it, but
ultimately, this will be very much liked,

01:12:18.560 --> 01:12:19.560
this truth.

01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.560
So all these things he has put together and
said that, "You have to speak the truth, the

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.560
truth has to be pleasing to the spirit, and
ultimately, the person is going to enjoy it."

01:12:21.560 --> 01:12:22.560
So the truth is everything is illusion, except
for the Divine of God that is all-pervading

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:23.560
which you can feel through your spirit.

01:12:23.560 --> 01:12:24.560
This power has got telecommunications.

01:12:24.560 --> 01:12:25.560
It has got all that you have created in the
science.

01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:26.560
It can coordinate and cooperate.

01:12:26.560 --> 01:12:27.560
It has got all the angels and all the great
hosts to help it and to look after you.

01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:28.560
And the top, toppng the whole thing is the
quality that is love, is love.

01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.560
So it doesn't come to you like a sword, it
gives you the time to improve, to judge yourself,

01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560
to rise, to grow.

01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:31.560
Just as a mother would look after her child,
forgive mistakes, see that the child rises

01:12:31.560 --> 01:12:32.560
and grows into complete manhood.

01:12:32.560 --> 01:12:33.560
So it is love and the love that is so powerful
is the truth; and it never fails, it never

01:12:33.560 --> 01:12:34.560
fails.

01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:35.560
For example you might think now a man like
Sadat has died.

01:12:35.560 --> 01:12:36.560
"Mother how do you explain?"

01:12:36.560 --> 01:12:37.560
I mean, you never die, that's one thing you
do not know.

01:12:37.560 --> 01:12:38.560
He can be born again, he would be born in
such a condition where he'll be much more

01:12:38.560 --> 01:12:39.560
effective.

01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.560
He has himself died at the top of his glory.

01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.560
I mean, for him, he's a (inaudible).

01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:42.560
If you see from his angle, everywhere in the
whole world, Sadat.

01:12:42.560 --> 01:12:43.560
Sa-dat, it's a big name too.

01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:44.560
But supposing he had fallen in his glory and
all that, then he would have died, then God

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:45.560
would not have been just to him, I would say.

01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:46.560
But he died in all his glory and he can be
born again.

01:12:46.560 --> 01:12:47.560
And he can take a position from where he can
do much better work, in the name of God, in

01:12:47.560 --> 01:12:48.560
the field of God because now we don't have
to do any more work, otherwise in any other

01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:49.560
field.

01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:50.560
We have had enough of trains, we don't want
any more now.

01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:51.560
We have had enough of plastics, now we have
mountains.

01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:52.560
We've got too much of butter around, too much
of food, everything abit too much, I mean

01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.560
the house becomes a junk.

01:12:53.560 --> 01:12:54.560
In any field we have overdone things.

01:12:54.560 --> 01:12:55.560
We have exhausted this Mother Earth.

01:12:55.560 --> 01:12:56.560
Now what do we have to do.

01:12:56.560 --> 01:12:57.560
Only in one field and the field that is of
God's work you have to do.

01:12:57.560 --> 01:12:58.560
But first you have to get connected and then
do the God's work.

01:12:58.560 --> 01:12:59.560
And that connection is only through your spirit,
when you become absolute and you have the

01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:00.560
truth within you as a built-in awareness.

01:13:00.560 --> 01:13:01.560
It's the awareness that becomes the truth.

01:13:01.560 --> 01:13:02.560
So the first quality of the spirit is that
you become the truth, that you know the truth,

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:03.560
that you take a stand on the truth.

01:13:03.560 --> 01:13:04.560
Look at Christ.

01:13:04.560 --> 01:13:05.560
He had nothing to do with women like Mary
Magdalene, I mean, nothing to do, I mean,

01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.560
he was virtue, he was innocence.

01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:07.560
But when he saw people were stoning her, he
took up a stand.

01:13:07.560 --> 01:13:08.560
He took up a stand.

01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:09.560
You have to take up a stand, stand on the
truth.

01:13:09.560 --> 01:13:10.560
And he said those who have not committed any
sin can throw, and you can throw the stone

01:13:10.560 --> 01:13:11.560
at me.

01:13:11.560 --> 01:13:12.560
And nobody did.

01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:13.560
He did this because he was standing on the
truth.

01:13:13.560 --> 01:13:14.560
He took a whip and whipped those people who
were selling in the temple of God.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.560
At eight, when he was a little boy, he went
and argued with learned people.

01:13:15.560 --> 01:13:16.560
Such people have no fear of anything.

01:13:16.560 --> 01:13:17.560
What is there to fear?

01:13:17.560 --> 01:13:18.560
When you are standing on the truth, what is
there to fear?

01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560
Truth is such a light that it gives you complete
picture of the whole thing.

01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560
There's nothing to fear.

01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:21.560
Your Father, He is compassion, He's ocean
of compassion.

01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:22.560
And He's ocean of love and ocean of forgiveness.

01:13:22.560 --> 01:13:23.560
And He is now within you.

01:13:23.560 --> 01:13:24.560
Who is more powerful than Him?

01:13:24.560 --> 01:13:25.560
It's very easy for many human beings to say,
"Oh, we don't believe in God."

01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:26.560
You believe it or not, He's there.

01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.560
Those who say, "We don't believe", it is better
that they should come and get their realisation

01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:28.560
and understand that there's very little time
left for such kind of nonsensical statements.

01:13:28.560 --> 01:13:29.560
I mean you can at the most say that I've not
felt God so far and I'm open, if I feel.

01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560
But on what basis do you deny, what basis
have you got to say that you don't believe

01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.560
in God?

01:13:31.560 --> 01:13:32.560
Not only after realisation you can prove God,
but you can show His miracles.

01:13:32.560 --> 01:13:33.560
The second thing, the nature of spirit is
that he's chitta, he's the attention.

01:13:33.560 --> 01:13:34.560
He's the attention means when you become spiritually
enlightened your attention becomes enlightened.

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:35.560
Now enlightenment, what we understand of these
lights is that the lights are falling here,

01:13:35.560 --> 01:13:36.560
and we can see things, that's all.

01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:37.560
But this attention which is being enlightened,
acts, it works, it has got loops, it has got

01:13:37.560 --> 01:13:38.560
weapons, it works.

01:13:38.560 --> 01:13:39.560
You have to see for yourself how your attention
works.

01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:40.560
Today there was somebody who went and told
one of the Sahaja Yogis that, "I was sitting

01:13:40.560 --> 01:13:41.560
there and I was getting all negative thoughts
and feeling horrible in my hands and I don't

01:13:41.560 --> 01:13:42.560
know why it was happening in the program."

01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:43.560
First he said, "Here you have come to pay
attention to Mother and to Her work and pay

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:44.560
attention to your spirit.

01:13:44.560 --> 01:13:45.560
But if you're paying attention to all the
people here, then you're going to suffer."

01:13:45.560 --> 01:13:46.560
It's a very simple thing, where is your attention?

01:13:46.560 --> 01:13:47.560
Ask this question.

01:13:47.560 --> 01:13:48.560
This is a very common question in an Indian
home, a mother will ask a child, "Where is

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:49.560
your attention?"

01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:50.560
The basis of Indian life is chitta nirodh,
is to fix your attention in a proper way.

01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.560
Where is your attention?

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:52.560
Is it on your spirit?

01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:53.560
Or is it on somebody else, like, "My brother
is sitting here, my mother is sitting there,

01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:54.560
oh, that woman is very bad, she's jealous
of me," all these nonsense.

01:13:54.560 --> 01:13:55.560
Where is your attention?

01:13:55.560 --> 01:13:56.560
When you get realised then you start seeing
through the window of the spirit, your position

01:13:56.560 --> 01:13:57.560
changes.

01:13:57.560 --> 01:13:58.560
As you're looking at Me now, then you come
back here and start looking at you different.

01:13:58.560 --> 01:13:59.560
Till you're realised you are sitting before
Me.

01:13:59.560 --> 01:14:00.560
But once you're realised you come here and
see others from there, that's your fort.

01:14:00.560 --> 01:14:01.560
Nobody can touch you there.

01:14:01.560 --> 01:14:02.560
From there you'll see others, your attention
is detached.

01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:03.560
So the attention becomes enlightened after
realisation.

01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:04.560
You pay attention to anything, it works.

01:14:04.560 --> 01:14:05.560
It does work, no doubt, it fact.

01:14:05.560 --> 01:14:06.560
Those who've got realisation should try, try
your attention, but attention has to be pure.

01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:07.560
You have to purify your attention, and the
best way to purify it is to keep your agnya

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:08.560
chakra open.

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.560
When this centre is open, which is the centre
of Christ, which I've shown that it can only

01:14:09.560 --> 01:14:10.560
open through the Lord's Prayer, after realisation.

01:14:10.560 --> 01:14:11.560
When you open that, then you are in that state
where your attention is divine.

01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:12.560
And you'll be amazed how things work out,
even the smallest things, the material things,

01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:13.560
the useless things and the great things, and
the subtle and subtlest, and how you start

01:14:13.560 --> 01:14:14.560
growing.

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:15.560
So the growth is to be achieved by purifying
your attention, and to purify this attention

01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:16.560
is to keep your agnya chakra open and be in
thoughtless awareness.

01:14:16.560 --> 01:14:17.560
You watch something, you don't think about
it.

01:14:17.560 --> 01:14:18.560
Zen said the same thing but I think people
didn't understand, you see, before realisation

01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:19.560
it's like telling about colours to a blind
man.

01:14:19.560 --> 01:14:20.560
Zen said the same thing, you watch the thing
without thinking about it.

01:14:20.560 --> 01:14:21.560
They created patterns which didn't mean anything,
which you see it without thinking.

01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:22.560
But that's only possible after realisation.

01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:23.560
So the thinking process minimises and you
start witnessing.

01:14:23.560 --> 01:14:24.560
The higher state than that of attention is
that you jump into Nirvikalpa Samadhi, into

01:14:24.560 --> 01:14:25.560
the state of doubtless awareness.

01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.560
Now it is not doubtlessness because you've
argued it out or anything.

01:14:26.560 --> 01:14:27.560
But it's a state where you're doubtless about
things.

01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:28.560
I mean the way you feel, the way you behave,
the way your attention is, you can make it

01:14:28.560 --> 01:14:29.560
out that "I'm doubtlessly there."

01:14:29.560 --> 01:14:30.560
The discrimination becomes so sharp that you
can just say, "This is so and so and so,"

01:14:30.560 --> 01:14:31.560
there's no fanaticism about it.

01:14:31.560 --> 01:14:32.560
As I told you this morning that if a blind
man cross over something and says, "Oh there's

01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:33.560
a snake here," and you believe it's a snake,
you believe that's a snake, that's fanaticism.

01:14:33.560 --> 01:14:34.560
Because he has no eyes to see and you believe
it's a snake, he says, "Oh, there is a snake

01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:35.560
there, I believe."

01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:36.560
But to a person who has eyes, he knows it's
a rope, it's just a rope.

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560
And he says, "No, it's not, it's a rope."

01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:38.560
But he has eyes and when he says with his
eyes, he can see that, that it's a rope, he

01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:39.560
means it, the truth, then he's not a fanatic.

01:14:39.560 --> 01:14:40.560
But he's standing on the truth.

01:14:40.560 --> 01:14:41.560
This subtle difference people don't understand.

01:14:41.560 --> 01:14:42.560
Fanaticism comes through blindness and the
truth comes through realisation.

01:14:42.560 --> 01:14:43.560
And at any cost you'll not give up the truth,
any cost.

01:14:43.560 --> 01:14:44.560
Now when I started My work in 1970, somehow
I knew all about these fake gurus and fake

01:14:44.560 --> 01:14:45.560
people, I knew about them.

01:14:45.560 --> 01:14:46.560
And in My first lecture, we had about, must
be having about two, three thousand people,

01:14:46.560 --> 01:14:47.560
very huge hall, and I told the names of all
these fake people and who they were in previous

01:14:47.560 --> 01:14:48.560
lives and what they did, by name.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.560
And everybody was amazed at Me, they were
frightened.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.560
There was a Maharajah who was a friend of
My husband and all that, and he came and told

01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:51.560
Me that, "Oh Mataji, I am very frightened
for you."

01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:52.560
I said, "Why?"

01:14:52.560 --> 01:14:53.560
He said, "These people are horrid, they mint
money, they mint their whole earnings out

01:14:53.560 --> 01:14:54.560
of it.

01:14:54.560 --> 01:14:55.560
How did you say these things openly, (inaudible),
they will shoot you."

01:14:55.560 --> 01:14:56.560
I said, "Let them shoot.

01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560
I'll see who shoots Me."

01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.560
They said, "You see they will prosecute you."

01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.560
I said, "Let them prosecute."

01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560
So many years have passed, nobody has dared
to say that I'm telling the lie.

01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560
There is no fear.

01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.560
You love, but you don't love satanic people,
you don't love Satans.

01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.560
The Satan who has spoiled the Kundalini of
people, who have spoiled all the chances of

01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.560
their getting realisation, as a mother, do
you think I should say they're very good people?

01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.560
I'm not a political figure and I'm not seeking
election.

01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:06.560
Cannot be a compromise.

01:15:06.560 --> 01:15:07.560
That's what happens to you also.

01:15:07.560 --> 01:15:08.560
But by your own self-esteem, by your own glory,
people see, "Here is a leader", and you become

01:15:08.560 --> 01:15:09.560
the leader of the people.

01:15:09.560 --> 01:15:10.560
You can, there is nothing to be frightened
of.

01:15:10.560 --> 01:15:11.560
There should be no half-bakes, as Christ,
as he read it out to you, that luke-warm people

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:12.560
he spits them out of the mouth.

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:13.560
If you're hot, if you're devils, he'll fight
you; if you're cold, you're my children.

01:15:13.560 --> 01:15:14.560
But luke-warm people are cunning, because
all kinds of forces are pulling, there's no

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:15.560
progress of any kind.

01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:16.560
You come, you come, negative, positive, they're
pulled this way, that way.

01:15:16.560 --> 01:15:17.560
There cannot be compromise with truth.

01:15:17.560 --> 01:15:18.560
And then you would see you will have the real
connecting force, the real blessings of God,

01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:19.560
in every way.

01:15:19.560 --> 01:15:20.560
You don't have to worry about money, you don't
have to worry about anything, it all works

01:15:20.560 --> 01:15:21.560
out, everything works out.

01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:22.560
You can't believe it how much it works out.

01:15:22.560 --> 01:15:23.560
I'll tell you about these Australians: Australians
were finding it very difficult to get a place

01:15:23.560 --> 01:15:24.560
to have an ashram, and, one day, frantically
one of the girls telephoned to me, "Mother,

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:25.560
we cannot have a place, now we don't know
where to go, we've sold our houses, we have

01:15:25.560 --> 01:15:26.560
no place to go to."

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.560
I said, "Don't you worry, tomorrow, you'll
get it."

01:15:27.560 --> 01:15:28.560
And she was surprised how I told her, "Tomorrow
you'll get it."

01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:29.560
After telephoning and all that, she went home
and she received a call, I mean there was

01:15:29.560 --> 01:15:30.560
a call from a estate agent.

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:31.560
When they went to see him next day he said,
"There is an ashram available, would you like

01:15:31.560 --> 01:15:32.560
to have it?".

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:33.560
At a very cheap rate, they got a beautiful
house for the ashram.

01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:34.560
In London, we had some sort of a small ashram,
they were finding it very difficult for all

01:15:34.560 --> 01:15:35.560
these people to live there, because they wanted
to live together.

01:15:35.560 --> 01:15:36.560
They said, "Mother, we must have some more
room and some more place."

01:15:36.560 --> 01:15:37.560
I said, "Alright you just pray, it will work
out."

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:38.560
You won't believe, we had started a co-op
in London, and they said it will take eight

01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:39.560
years to get a room out of this co-op.

01:15:39.560 --> 01:15:40.560
That's London for you, just the opposite of
America.

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:41.560
And within a month's time, we got a huge house,
huge house with fifteen bedrooms and two big

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.560
halls and we didn't know what to do with it,
and at such a cheap rate that for the whole

01:15:42.560 --> 01:15:43.560
week, only seventy pounds were to be paid.

01:15:43.560 --> 01:15:44.560
But then the Sahaja Yogis went and settled
down there because in London we have in thousands.

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:45.560
Then they said, "Mother what about for others?"

01:15:45.560 --> 01:15:46.560
And within fifteen days we got a huge big
hotel with all carpets and with all curtains

01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:47.560
and everything provided for, cutlery, crockery,
anything you say was there.

01:15:47.560 --> 01:15:48.560
Everything, only for ninety pounds a week,
for at least twenty people to live very happily

01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:49.560
and big rooms each and big halls.

01:15:49.560 --> 01:15:50.560
That we got it.

01:15:50.560 --> 01:15:51.560
You won't believe that it has happened just
before Warren's marriage and we didn't know

01:15:51.560 --> 01:15:52.560
where they're going to stay, all of these
who were coming to get married here, and they

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:53.560
had a nice honeymoon in that hotel.

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.560
They didn't have to pay anything for it.

01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:55.560
Yes, it works out.

01:15:55.560 --> 01:15:56.560
Krishna has said, "Yoga kshema wahamyaham."

01:15:56.560 --> 01:15:57.560
You get to your yoga first, he never said,
"Kshema yoga," he said, "Yoga kshema wahamyaham."

01:15:57.560 --> 01:15:58.560
You get your realisation, you get your yoga
and then the kshema, the well-being works

01:15:58.560 --> 01:15:59.560
out.

01:15:59.560 --> 01:16:00.560
Everything is organised then for you, you're
on the stage, everyone works for you, believe

01:16:00.560 --> 01:16:01.560
Me, it happens that way.

01:16:01.560 --> 01:16:02.560
What is there to hanker after, what is there
to ask for, I mean you ask for one thing,

01:16:02.560 --> 01:16:03.560
you have thousands, you don't know what to
do with them.

01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:04.560
I don't know, really, I don't know with Myself,
I don't know what to do , the way, I'm quite

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:05.560
generous, I mean, I try to give away so many
things but still My house, oh God!

01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:06.560
You can't imagine, you can't imagine, in their
wedding I gave fifty-one saris, fifty-one,

01:16:06.560 --> 01:16:07.560
thinking that now I'll some left from these
saris.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:08.560
Again I went back, they're still there.

01:16:08.560 --> 01:16:09.560
I don't know, now what am I to do, I brought
now some to America, to give away and all

01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:10.560
that, you just give and you get, everything,
you get fed-up.

01:16:10.560 --> 01:16:11.560
But only thing that I always have been asking
for are the seekers.

01:16:11.560 --> 01:16:12.560
Where are they lost, where are they?

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:13.560
That's something still there, they are to
be saved, because as I told you Christ is

01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:14.560
going to come back with eleven destructive
powers and there's going to be no question,

01:16:14.560 --> 01:16:15.560
no realisation, just...

01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:16.560
All the negative forces will be killed and
those who enter into the kingdom of God will

01:16:16.560 --> 01:16:17.560
reside in the kingdom of God, will reside
there, the residents, the citizens.

01:16:17.560 --> 01:16:18.560
As he said, if you want money, I'll give you
gold.

01:16:18.560 --> 01:16:19.560
But I look after those who hanker after spirit.

01:16:19.560 --> 01:16:20.560
You enter through the door and he eats with
you, he shares with you.

01:16:20.560 --> 01:16:21.560
For a realised soul the highest human beings
are the seekers.

01:16:21.560 --> 01:16:22.560
You may be any king or anything, what does
it matter, there are so many roaming about.

01:16:22.560 --> 01:16:23.560
But a seeker is the thing in the eyes of God
as the highest human being, first to become

01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:24.560
a super-human being.

01:16:24.560 --> 01:16:25.560
So your attention is (inaudible), so many
of these miracles, you cannot imagine.

01:16:25.560 --> 01:16:26.560
How many have taken place with Sahaja Yogis,
can write such a big book.

01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560
So the attention becomes pure.

01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560
You just can't see bad things happening, I
mean, you just don't like it, I mean, I feel

01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.560
like vomitting sometimes, the way things are,
sometimes.

01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:30.560
The things that you enjoy normally become
absolutely garbage, with the... don't like

01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:31.560
it, the whole, the priority is changed.

01:16:31.560 --> 01:16:32.560
If you become automatically virtuous, I don't
have to tell you, "Be virtuous," you just

01:16:32.560 --> 01:16:33.560
become, and you start enjoying your virtue
and virtues of others.

01:16:33.560 --> 01:16:34.560
You start enjoying other people because attention
becomes collectively conscious.

01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:35.560
Our central nervous system is our attention
but the central nervous system becomes collectively

01:16:35.560 --> 01:16:36.560
conscious, becomes.

01:16:36.560 --> 01:16:37.560
You're not bothered, somebody has cancer,
it's alright, I'll try to cure it.

01:16:37.560 --> 01:16:38.560
You are not afraid you'll get cancer, nothing,
you're never afraid of.

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.560
I'll try, you'll put your hands like this,
like that.

01:16:39.560 --> 01:16:40.560
That fellow says, "Oh I'm feeling very much
better, I don't know, what have you done for

01:16:40.560 --> 01:16:41.560
me?"

01:16:41.560 --> 01:16:42.560
Nothing.

01:16:42.560 --> 01:16:43.560
The attention becomes so effective, so powerful,
it does tremendous things and attention among

01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:44.560
yourselves has a rapport.

01:16:44.560 --> 01:16:45.560
They all move like the several drops in an
ocean, in a wave of love, it's so beautiful.

01:16:45.560 --> 01:16:46.560
The white men came to India long time back
as (inaudible), but when they came with Me,

01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:47.560
if you see, we have some films, how the Indian
villagers, you see, took them to their heart,

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:48.560
danced with them, fed them, loved them, it's
so sweet.

01:16:48.560 --> 01:16:49.560
And they write to them, it's so beautiful,
there's no artificiality, it's not just assuming,

01:16:49.560 --> 01:16:50.560
"I love you, you love me", it's not that.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:51.560
It's just the enjoyment of the company of
other realised souls.

01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.560
We talk of victims, "Oh we are all brothers
and sisters," it's all talk, talk, talk, talk,

01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:53.560
talk.

01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:54.560
Then you just become, you forget your colour,
you forget your nationality, you forget everything,

01:16:54.560 --> 01:16:55.560
you just feel, oh, as a Sahaja Yogi.

01:16:55.560 --> 01:16:56.560
It's a very different plane into which you
arrive where you feel so happy, joyous, the

01:16:56.560 --> 01:16:57.560
whole thing is a fun.

01:16:57.560 --> 01:16:58.560
And when it comes to helping, all of them
contribute.

01:16:58.560 --> 01:16:59.560
When they find a negative force is coming,
all of them come together.

01:16:59.560 --> 01:17:00.560
There is never a discussion among them, never.

01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:01.560
They try to pull him out.

01:17:01.560 --> 01:17:02.560
They tell him, all of them will tell by their
own ways and methods that this is wrong, this

01:17:02.560 --> 01:17:03.560
is wrong.

01:17:03.560 --> 01:17:04.560
It's such a combination, I never have to tell
them.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:05.560
I don't have to tell them that I'll give you
some lessons now, for example how to carry

01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:06.560
on, among yourselves, nothing, they just manage.

01:17:06.560 --> 01:17:07.560
Not only that but a person will say, "Now
see," A will say to B, "I am catching on my

01:17:07.560 --> 01:17:08.560
Agnya, will you help me there."

01:17:08.560 --> 01:17:09.560
That means, "I'm ego."

01:17:09.560 --> 01:17:10.560
And the other fellow will say, "Alright I'll
try" They just help each other, without feeling

01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.560
bad, there's no remorse of anything, there's
no heart burning, no jealousy.

01:17:11.560 --> 01:17:12.560
What a relationship is established like one
singer doesn't have jealousy with the other,

01:17:12.560 --> 01:17:13.560
she has no jealousy with the other cell of
the same primordial.

01:17:13.560 --> 01:17:14.560
There's no need even to talk of love, you
are in love.

01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:15.560
Everybody can see that you love.

01:17:15.560 --> 01:17:16.560
It's really working how you become so much
adaptable, so much silent and happy people,

01:17:16.560 --> 01:17:17.560
when our attention becomes collectively conscious,
because that's the real source of joy.

01:17:17.560 --> 01:17:18.560
And the greatest quality of the spirit is
that you're pure joy.

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:19.560
It's pure joy.

01:17:19.560 --> 01:17:20.560
We talk of unhappiness and happiness, sorrow
and ecstasy and all these words, but joy is

01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.560
pure.

01:17:21.560 --> 01:17:22.560
It hasn't got the duality.

01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.560
It's one, single, absolute.

01:17:23.560 --> 01:17:24.560
I'm leaving you and My heart is wrenching.

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:25.560
The joy is seeing that.

01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:26.560
Seeing that this Nirmala is wrenching, bleeding.

01:17:26.560 --> 01:17:27.560
The joy is seeing and when I go, this feeling,
everything and outlook of you and the joy

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:28.560
will be again visible.

01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:29.560
That joy of oneness even in separation the
oneness I feel, it's such a joy..., that cannot

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:30.560
be expressed in words, that silent (inaudible)
of your heart, that is also joy.

01:17:30.560 --> 01:17:31.560
Joy is absolute, it comes through seeing,
you see it and you get the joy.

01:17:31.560 --> 01:17:32.560
Joy is the quality when you gradually move
from the brain, the attention first goes into

01:17:32.560 --> 01:17:33.560
the brain, especially in the West, it's the
brain first, takes place.

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:34.560
Here it becomes the attention, I'm sorry,
you become the truth.

01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:35.560
You start feeling in the hand, you understand,
then you'll see, "Yes, it is so and this person

01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:36.560
has got this trouble, so he must be having
arthritis, he's catching on this (inaudible)."

01:17:36.560 --> 01:17:37.560
You start tallying, finding out and monitoring
this and again verifying it and you are satisfied

01:17:37.560 --> 01:17:38.560
with it.

01:17:38.560 --> 01:17:39.560
So the attention first is nothing but start
appealing this truth.

01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:40.560
It's trying to feel the truth but it's blocked
at that stage, it's trying.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:41.560
In the West, special, because we are differently
made in the West.

01:17:41.560 --> 01:17:42.560
Then you read the book "Advent", you like
it and you see all these things and knowledge

01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:43.560
and all the things you like and you want to
listen to My speech and all that.

01:17:43.560 --> 01:17:44.560
Your life is (inaudible) knowledge because
you're seeing the truth, the knowledge.

01:17:44.560 --> 01:17:45.560
That's the gift of the brain, is the central
path as I just said, the awareness.

01:17:45.560 --> 01:17:46.560
Then you feel your chitta, your attention
which is enlightened, and you're blasted with

01:17:46.560 --> 01:17:47.560
it.

01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:48.560
You see the miracles happening, that happening,
you're just blasted.

01:17:48.560 --> 01:17:49.560
Then the third thing happens; is the joy,
that you are in joy all the time.

01:17:49.560 --> 01:17:50.560
You cannot be serious for more than two minutes,
it's very difficult to keep serious.

01:17:50.560 --> 01:17:51.560
The sense of humour is so beautiful, you'll
never use vulgarity or hurting things or coarser

01:17:51.560 --> 01:17:52.560
remarks, but the whole thing is so beautiful.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.560
When you speak, people feel the flowers throwing
their fragrance at you.

01:17:53.560 --> 01:17:54.560
Every action that you do creates joy, ripple
of joy.

01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:55.560
Every movement you create, every rhythm you
speak it gives you joy.

01:17:55.560 --> 01:17:56.560
That time you feel perfected.

01:17:56.560 --> 01:17:57.560
When you see a picture which is beautiful,
immediately you go into thoughtless awareness,

01:17:57.560 --> 01:17:58.560
and the complete joy of that creation starts
blossoming, you just feel the joy.

01:17:58.560 --> 01:17:59.560
When you become silent, you don't think much,
you don't think, you become the joy, anand.

01:17:59.560 --> 01:18:00.560
That's the perfect state in which you feel
peace, it's so beautiful that you want to

01:18:00.560 --> 01:18:01.560
be there all the time.

01:18:01.560 --> 01:18:02.560
This joy is the movement of your ocean of
love.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:03.560
It's the beautiful movement of the clouds
that you see.

01:18:03.560 --> 01:18:04.560
It's fantastic, you just get drenched into
it and you do everything for love's sake and

01:18:04.560 --> 01:18:05.560
you don't think you're doing it for love's
sake, you do not see that way, you just do

01:18:05.560 --> 01:18:06.560
it, because it's so joy-giving; that it is
the greatest thing, you may have anything

01:18:06.560 --> 01:18:07.560
in the world will not be that much joy-giving
as this joy of the spirit within.

01:18:07.560 --> 01:18:08.560
You'll never feel lonely, you're never bored,
whether you're alone or with anyone, you are

01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:09.560
in joy.

01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:10.560
One should understand that if you get your
self-realisation or if somebody says that

01:18:10.560 --> 01:18:11.560
they're giving you some positive mind, you
should know, are you peaceful within you,

01:18:11.560 --> 01:18:12.560
are you joy; forget about the collective consciousness,
is your health alright?

01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:13.560
That's the minimum of minimum.

01:18:13.560 --> 01:18:14.560
The whole system changes.

01:18:14.560 --> 01:18:15.560
I just pray that all of you should achieve
that state of joy by the time I come here

01:18:15.560 --> 01:18:16.560
next year.

01:18:16.560 --> 01:18:17.560
And I hope you grow in it by taking up a stand
on the truth.

01:18:17.560 --> 01:18:18.560
Grow into it.

01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:19.560
You progress into it.

01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:20.560
It's so wonderful and so beautiful and that's
what your Father wants you to have.

01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:21.560
He's the most generous Father; He can't enjoy
His kingdom unless and until He has given

01:18:21.560 --> 01:18:22.560
it to you, that He has made you sit on His
throne.

01:18:22.560 --> 01:18:23.560
That's the greatest joy that He wants to have
and that's what you should achieve, that's

01:18:23.560 --> 01:18:24.560
what you should have, that's your right to
have.

01:18:24.560 --> 01:18:25.560
This is what is self-realisation - you become
just the master.

01:18:25.560 --> 01:18:26.560
You don't have to consult anyone, you know
it.

01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:27.560
You have to just consult your spirit, through
your vibratory awareness and you know it.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:28.560
These are the blessings of self-realisation,
into which you have to grow and as you grow

01:18:28.560 --> 01:18:29.560
you start manifesting your powers.

01:18:29.560 --> 01:18:30.560
You can raise the Kundalini, you can give
realisation at the very outset.

01:18:30.560 --> 01:18:31.560
Imagine the Kundalini moves under your fingers,
nobody can believe it but it has happened

01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.560
now.

01:18:32.560 --> 01:18:33.560
Even very, very great saints, you see, there
is a very great saint who is more than hundred

01:18:33.560 --> 01:18:34.560
and eight years of age, and he asked Me, "Mother,
I have spent thousands of years to get these

01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:35.560
vibrations and these people have got it without
any (inaudible)."

01:18:35.560 --> 01:18:36.560
I said, "Why did you do it, who asked you
to do it?

01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:37.560
If you'd taken it easy, you'd have got it."

01:18:37.560 --> 01:18:38.560
He's a very sweet fellow, but because he's
got it through his efforts he has that feeling

01:18:38.560 --> 01:18:39.560
that, "I've got it through my efforts."

01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:40.560
You'll never get it through effort, I tell
you.

01:18:40.560 --> 01:18:41.560
When you're finished with your efforts you
just get it, maybe in an abstraction, or maybe...Yes,

01:18:41.560 --> 01:18:42.560
when Buddha was tired, finished, fagged-out,
then he got his realisation.

01:18:42.560 --> 01:18:43.560
When you stop your efforts then only you'll
get your realisation.

01:18:43.560 --> 01:18:44.560
So why to boast of your efforts, I told him.

01:18:44.560 --> 01:18:45.560
He's a very powerful man because he's done
lots of things and he always goes on a big,

01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:46.560
very big tiger and because he's hurt himself,
he says that people have beaten him, so he's

01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.560
hurt himself so he always uses a tiger.

01:18:47.560 --> 01:18:48.560
And he's a man with the idea that he has this
power, that power.

01:18:48.560 --> 01:18:49.560
When I went to see him, I knew that because
he told people that Mother has come, so you

01:18:49.560 --> 01:18:50.560
go and see Her and all that and I knew he
was there so I went to see him.

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:51.560
When I went to see him, we had to climb about
three miles, one has to walk up, and I was

01:18:51.560 --> 01:18:52.560
walking up and when I reached there it was
raining and I got completely drenched.

01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.560
And this fellow is supposed powers over the
rain.

01:18:53.560 --> 01:18:54.560
And he was so angry when I went there he was
sitting on a little seat of his made of some

01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.560
straws.

01:18:55.560 --> 01:18:56.560
He was doing like this, like this, very angry.

01:18:56.560 --> 01:18:57.560
So I didn't say anything, I went inside his
thing and sat down there in that drenched

01:18:57.560 --> 01:18:58.560
condition.

01:18:58.560 --> 01:18:59.560
He came down and he said, "Mother, did you
do this to kill my ego?"

01:18:59.560 --> 01:19:00.560
I said, "What, I didn't do anything.

01:19:00.560 --> 01:19:01.560
What did I do?"

01:19:01.560 --> 01:19:02.560
He said, "This rain wouldn't listen to me."

01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:03.560
I said, "Now, don't be angry, sit down.

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:04.560
Haven't you bought a sari for Me, and you
are a sanyasi, I won't take a sari from a

01:19:04.560 --> 01:19:05.560
sanyasi now.

01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:06.560
You've have got a sari for Me isn't it?

01:19:06.560 --> 01:19:07.560
So I have to get drenched, otherwise I will
not take a sari from you."

01:19:07.560 --> 01:19:08.560
And the whole temper melted, whole temper
melted away.

01:19:08.560 --> 01:19:09.560
Then I said, "It was necessary the water to
flow over My body so that all the plains around

01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:10.560
you become beautiful, is vibrated with water."

01:19:10.560 --> 01:19:11.560
But he is a very great soul I must say, because
he doesn't talk to Me like ordinary human

01:19:11.560 --> 01:19:12.560
beings talk.

01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:13.560
His style is different because he recognises,
he knows who I am.

01:19:13.560 --> 01:19:14.560
He's a very different being, and a day will
come when you will also rise, you'll rise

01:19:14.560 --> 01:19:15.560
and grow and grow and there we'll see the
glory of this great new age, new generation

01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:16.560
into the complete newness of the (inaudible).

01:19:16.560 --> 01:19:17.560
Today I was going to tell you about certain
diseases that one has and how to control them

01:19:17.560 --> 01:19:18.560
and I would suggest that we have a book, are
you going to sell it to everyone?

01:19:18.560 --> 01:19:19.560
We don't have many.

01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:20.560
So we would say those who have been coming
for all the four lectures should buy the book.

01:19:20.560 --> 01:19:21.560
We're sorry we don't have many books but we
hope to send you these books later on and

01:19:21.560 --> 01:19:22.560
it's a very good book in which we can see
what imbalances can work out, like how you

01:19:22.560 --> 01:19:23.560
get diabetes, how you get kidney trouble,
blood pressure and then how you have to balance

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:24.560
your liver, and how to look after the security
and all these things are written in that book

01:19:24.560 --> 01:19:25.560
at length.

01:19:25.560 --> 01:19:26.560
Quite a knowledgeable book I should say.

01:19:26.560 --> 01:19:27.560
I took the writer, I should say I really tortured
him.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:28.560
And everyday I used to see him coming up pulling
his ear, you see, that I don't know what mistakes

01:19:28.560 --> 01:19:29.560
I'm going to do.

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:30.560
And everytime he would come, I would say,
"Now, Gregoire you have to be sweeter.

01:19:30.560 --> 01:19:31.560
It's not that sweet, you're still a scholar,
you have to be a Sahaja Yogi," and a Sahaja

01:19:31.560 --> 01:19:32.560
Yogi is different from a scholar, he writes
his book in such a manner, in such a way that

01:19:32.560 --> 01:19:33.560
it's sweet, it's lovable, it's kind and I've
tried really to curb it down, curb it down.

01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:34.560
But he has written two chapters of his scholarliness,
all the scholarliness that he has, and it

01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:35.560
was like the really big boulder (inaudible)
enter into that book.

01:19:35.560 --> 01:19:36.560
So one day I told him.

01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:37.560
"These two chapters let us put it at the end
of the book," and he really collapsed.

01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:38.560
He said, "Mother, how can you do that to me,
it's too much."

01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560
I said, "But why, what's the problem?"

01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560
He said, "These two chapters are the ones
which introduce the book and how can you do

01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:41.560
it, I mean, it's in the beginning and how
can you put it at the end."

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:42.560
I said, "Gregoire, while correcting the book,
I saw to it that these chapters have nothing

01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:43.560
to do with the beginning, so you put them
at the end."

01:19:43.560 --> 01:19:44.560
And he (inaudible), "Oh the book has become
wonderful."

01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:45.560
And then he told me it'a a very good play
of Mother in this, that the intellectuals

01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:46.560
are never satisfied with the reason why, and
they would like to go into the intellectual

01:19:46.560 --> 01:19:47.560
rumination.

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:48.560
Like the animals, you see, like cows when
they eat, then they take it back and again

01:19:48.560 --> 01:19:49.560
eat it, like that.

01:19:49.560 --> 01:19:50.560
It's better to put these two chapters for
them.

01:19:50.560 --> 01:19:51.560
I said, "Now you are not angry with me?"

01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:52.560
He said, "No, it's a very good thing."

01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:53.560
But these two chapters definitely prove that
he's a very learned man.

01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:54.560
And I told him, "Gregoire, when did you read
all these books that you've quoted."

01:19:54.560 --> 01:19:55.560
He said, "Mother, you'll be surprised, these
quotations just came to me, and I never, I

01:19:55.560 --> 01:19:56.560
never read them."

01:19:56.560 --> 01:19:57.560
I said, "You never read them?"

01:19:57.560 --> 01:19:58.560
"Yes, yes I've read them before, sometime
I must have read them, but at the right time,

01:19:58.560 --> 01:19:59.560
I got the right quotation."

01:19:59.560 --> 01:20:00.560
He's now coming to Los Angeles, he is a diplomat
in the Swiss government, and he's coming all

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:01.560
the way from Rome.

01:20:01.560 --> 01:20:02.560
(inaudible), and he's a very dynamic person,
I'm looking forward to My visit to Los Angeles.

01:20:02.560 --> 01:20:03.560
If you have any friends there or anything
you can write to them, you can take the address

01:20:03.560 --> 01:20:04.560
from here so that they can come and see you.

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:05.560
We have now booked all our dates, I'm sorry
and still we'll contact somebody from Unity

01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:06.560
Church, but all the days are booked.

01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:07.560
It's alright, the people can come in any case
whenever you have the program.

01:20:07.560 --> 01:20:08.560
Anything else you want you can write to Me.

01:20:08.560 --> 01:20:09.560
I'm sorry I can't write to you because everyday
I work, like this the way I've been working,

01:20:09.560 --> 01:20:10.560
morning, the workshops, evening, the lecture.

01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.560
It has been on and on for years together now.

01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.560
So, I do write sometimes, but I don't have
the time, but somebody will answer you.

01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:13.560
Any question, any problem, anything, please
write.

01:20:13.560 --> 01:20:14.560
I'll be very happy to receive letters from
you and there are so many people who are sorting

01:20:14.560 --> 01:20:15.560
them out and looking after this, you will
have an answer no doubt.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:16.560
Please get My address also from the ashram
address from these people.

01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:17.560
Anything that you want you can ask for it.

01:20:17.560 --> 01:20:18.560
Even sitting down here I know your attention.

01:20:18.560 --> 01:20:19.560
It will work out.

01:20:19.560 --> 01:20:20.560
Gradually you will change and your asking
will be different and different and different.

01:20:20.560 --> 01:20:21.560
May God bless you, blossom into the beauty
of your spirit so that you'll glorify your

01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:22.560
Father and this is glorified with His gracious
love towards you.

01:20:22.560 --> 01:20:22.564
Thank you very much.
