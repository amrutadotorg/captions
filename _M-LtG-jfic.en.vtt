00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.820
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:27.170
At the very outset I have to say that truth
is what it is.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:38.880
You cannot change it, you cannot describe
it and you cannot conceptualize it.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.620
It is, it has been and it will be.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:53.059
Now whatever I’m going to tell you today,
you need not accept it blindfolded.

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:02.850
We have had enough of trouble with blind faiths,
but you must keep your mind open, like a scientist

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:13.340
and if it proves to be alright, if it proves
what I am saying, as honest people you must

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:23.030
accept it, because it is for the benevolence
of your being, for the benevolence of your

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:35.270
city, of your country, of the whole world.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.900
Now, I would like to tell you what is the
truth.

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:51.670
The truth is, that you’re not this body,
this mind, this ego, these conditionings,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.030
you’re not that.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.660
But you are the pure spirit.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.870
This is the first truth about you.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:07.140
And the second truth is, that there is a all-pervading
power of Divine Love.

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.940
I hope you are all hearing me alright.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.070
Are you alright?

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:21.210
There’s a all- pervading power of Divine
love.

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.030
Is called by various names in the scriptures.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:31.340
For example in the Bible it’s called as
the Cool Breeze of the Holy Ghost, also all-pervading

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.170
power of Divine Love.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:42.470
Is called as ‘ruhx’ in Koran, in Sanskrit
it is called as ‘Brahma Chaitanya’ or

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:48.810
‘Ritambara Pragnya’, by Patanjali Yoga
Shastra.

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:50.810
Names can be anything.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.340
Means the same thing.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.960
That there is a subtle power, very dynamic
power of Divine Love which does all living

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.960
work.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.790
For example see these beautiful flowers here.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:15.000
It’s a miracle, these flowers have come
out of a small plant and the plant has come

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:25.319
out of a little seed and every flower is different,
every type of a flower is different.

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.910
Then who runs our heart?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.390
We never ask this question.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.150
It’s a living process.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.690
Who runs our heart?

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.380
The doctors will say it’s an autonomous
nervous system.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.030
But what is this autonomous nervous system?

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.670
Who is the auto behind it?

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.250
Everything that is living we take it for granted.

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.780
Even the scientists don’t enter that area,
because they know they can’t find anything

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:54.860
there.

00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:03.230
So how this living process is done, is a very
miraculous thing which we accept without knowing

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:12.890
about it, but is this all-pervading power,
which is very subtle and does this.

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:21.239
In every living action it is there.

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:29.419
Also it acts on the matter, in a way, like
vibrations we know isometric, symmetric, all

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:32.529
these vibrations are there.

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:37.610
Now to say that God doesn’t exist is very
easy.

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:38.610
To say that.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:44.009
But it’s not proper, it’s not scientific,
because you have not found out if there is

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.379
God or not God.

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:56.090
Without seeing that without finding it, if
we just say that there is no God, then I think

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.259
is not proper.

00:04:57.259 --> 00:05:02.870
There is a way to find it out.

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:11.870
Very simple way is as Stephen has already
told you, we have this kind of a mechanism

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.860
within us built in, during our evolutionary
process.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.419
In the evolutionary process we have become
human beings.

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.710
But we do not know the absolute truth.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.259
We don’t know.

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:27.740
That’s why the problem.

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.750
Some say communism is good, some say capitalism
is good, some say Christianity is good, some

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.500
say Islamic is good.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.900
All kinds of things people talk.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:44.439
That means everybody has a yarn in the head,
which they start putting before us.

00:05:44.439 --> 00:05:47.240
It’s just a mental projection.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.240
It is nothing to do with the Absolute.

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:55.240
If it was absolute [EVERY WOULD HAVE…del.]
everybody would have agreed to it or accepted

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.240
it.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.530
Now, I am sitting before you.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:58.659
Is a fact.

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:02.689
You know it for truth, so nobody’s going
to say that I am not sitting here.

00:06:02.689 --> 00:06:10.719
In the same way if you know the absolute truth,
then there cannot be any quarrel, fights,

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:14.819
any arguments, no wars.

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:19.960
This is the state we have to reach now where
we all know the absolute truth.

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:29.219
And this is the absolute truth which I have
told you already – what you are.

00:06:29.219 --> 00:06:38.439
As a result of this happening, when you get
connected through the awakening of this Kundalini,

00:06:38.439 --> 00:06:42.629
this power is called Kundalini because ‘kundal’
means a coil.

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:52.999
It’s a Primordial Mother, expressing Herself
as a reflection.

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:56.270
We have a concept of a Father, alright.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:59.520
We have a concept of a Son, alright.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:01.389
But we have no Mother.

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:04.219
That’s the Holy Ghost.

00:07:04.219 --> 00:07:06.270
Has to be.

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:12.169
But in all other religions except for Islam
and you can say the Jews.

00:07:12.169 --> 00:07:16.809
Jews also have the concept of the Primordial
Mother.

00:07:16.809 --> 00:07:29.669
They have Motherhood but they, I don’t know
why they evaded the problem of talking about

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.819
the Mother, the Primordial Mother.

00:07:32.819 --> 00:07:39.969
So this is the reflection of the Primordial
Mother in your triangular bone which is called

00:07:39.969 --> 00:07:41.870
as sacrum.

00:07:41.870 --> 00:07:44.819
That means the Greeks knew that it was a sacred
bone why would they call it sacrum of all

00:07:44.819 --> 00:07:45.819
the things?

00:07:45.819 --> 00:07:50.629
And I found out it was so.

00:07:50.629 --> 00:07:58.909
Now, the whole religion also the concept of
religion becoming mental, it has gone astray.

00:07:58.909 --> 00:08:00.759
Religion is within.

00:08:00.759 --> 00:08:06.270
You may be a Christian, Hindu, Muslim anything,
you can commit any sin.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:13.120
If religion had anything in it, everyone who
follows a particular religion would have been

00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.120
sinless.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.789
But they are not.

00:08:16.789 --> 00:08:21.060
So that means that religion has to be awakened
within us.

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.409
It has to be an innate religion.

00:08:23.409 --> 00:08:26.249
Whatever religion it is it should be innate,
which is not innate.

00:08:26.249 --> 00:08:33.300
And that’s why whatever religion we may
follow, we do not fall into line with what

00:08:33.300 --> 00:08:34.919
is said in the religion.

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:40.190
Now, Sahaja Yoga, he must have told you ‘saha’
means ‘with’ and ‘ja’ is ‘born with

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:45.430
you’ – this right to become one with this
all-pervading power.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:53.230
We have no idea at all how glorious we are,
what properties we have, what powers we have,

00:08:53.230 --> 00:09:01.610
what is in us, we have no idea at all I would
say, what we are capable of.

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:10.440
Because we are still not one with that all-pervading
power.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:17.209
Once this is awakened it passes through all
these six centers, nourishing them.

00:09:17.209 --> 00:09:23.160
Now the centers, the energy centres are our
fundamentals.

00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.490
The problems of the world if you see most
of them come from human beings.

00:09:27.490 --> 00:09:32.899
Those who have no peace within how can they
have peace without?

00:09:32.899 --> 00:09:37.690
In the same way there are so many things which
are said, which are not there.

00:09:37.690 --> 00:09:44.880
We know about priests in every religion are,
about immoral, about.

00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:47.830
Some are less some are more.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:48.830
How can you be?

00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:54.170
You are a priest, you are teaching something
nice and inside you are immoral.

00:09:54.170 --> 00:09:55.820
It is in every religion.

00:09:55.820 --> 00:09:58.639
It’s nothing new.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:02.750
That means they are just preaching, it’s
just like a radio, something coming out but

00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:04.250
nothing inside.

00:10:04.250 --> 00:10:10.870
And that’s why many people feel that religion
is useless, God is useless.

00:10:10.870 --> 00:10:14.050
That’s what they felt in communistic countries.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:20.660
When we don’t know ourselves how can we
talk about anything?

00:10:20.660 --> 00:10:25.690
Like we say this is my house, this is my car,
this is my wife, this is my husband.

00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:32.149
Everything ‘my’ but where is this ‘I’
to which all this belongs?

00:10:32.149 --> 00:10:39.060
So we have to go within, and how can we go
within, is the point.

00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:41.490
To go within is impossible.

00:10:41.490 --> 00:10:46.050
If I say that: ‘Please take your attention
inside,’ you cannot take it.

00:10:46.050 --> 00:10:50.190
So this happening takes place that this Kundalini
rises.

00:10:50.190 --> 00:10:58.810
By that happening your attention is pulled
inside and when She rises, She pierces through

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:09.160
this fontanel bone area, and you are in contact
with this all pervading power.

00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:15.060
First thing happens that you start feeling
cool breeze coming on your fingertips.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:19.300
You start feeling cool breeze coming out of
your own head.

00:11:19.300 --> 00:11:25.060
You are amazed at it but the experience is
very peaceful.

00:11:25.060 --> 00:11:32.180
You feel extremely relaxed, and the eyes start
sparkling.

00:11:32.180 --> 00:11:38.560
As a result of this happening the first thing
happens to you that you become peaceful.

00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:40.110
Absolutely.

00:11:40.110 --> 00:11:41.660
How?

00:11:41.660 --> 00:11:47.920
See actually we are thinking, all the time
our thoughts rise fall, rise fall.

00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:51.250
In between these thoughts there’s a little
space.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:55.990
When we are thinking we are thinking about
the future or about the past, not about the

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:58.310
present, we cannot think.

00:11:58.310 --> 00:12:05.690
So when this Kundalini rises then these thoughts
get elongated, and this space increases, and

00:12:05.690 --> 00:12:09.470
that’s the place where you become thoughtlessly
aware.

00:12:09.470 --> 00:12:12.350
You are aware but you are thoughtless.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:17.800
That’s the place, where you are in the present,
and you are peaceful.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:21.220
And that’s the state where you grow spiritually.

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.310
You cannot do meditation, you have to be in
meditation.

00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:30.470
Of course, you can’t pay for all this, is
something, I don’t know how many times I’ve

00:12:30.470 --> 00:12:35.240
told people, you can’t pay for your living
process.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:38.600
How much did we pay for our evolution?

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:44.370
How much, do we pay to Mother Earth for sprouting
the seeds?

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:49.310
So you can’t pay for it and it has been
so.

00:12:49.310 --> 00:12:53.879
I don’t know why people were so enamoured
by people who were taking money.

00:12:53.879 --> 00:12:59.220
I went to America, they said: ‘You don’t
take money so we don’t believe you.’

00:12:59.220 --> 00:13:01.000
I was surprised.

00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:02.820
What sort of a logic is this?

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.850
‘How much should you pay me?’

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.310
I said.

00:13:07.310 --> 00:13:15.270
The whole concept is that, everything is money,
God is money, even your ascent is money, everything

00:13:15.270 --> 00:13:17.509
you must pay.

00:13:17.509 --> 00:13:22.769
And such funny ideas they had that, we are
what we are giving him metal or something,

00:13:22.769 --> 00:13:26.810
we are giving him nothing but a Rolls Royce.

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:28.230
But he gives us the spirit.

00:13:28.230 --> 00:13:30.790
What spirit is he giving you?

00:13:30.790 --> 00:13:32.939
He is mesmerizing you.

00:13:32.939 --> 00:13:34.620
That’s what he’s doing.

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:36.259
You are not free.

00:13:36.259 --> 00:13:41.350
You are mesmerized and under mesmerism you
don’t understand what he’s doing to you.

00:13:41.350 --> 00:13:46.779
And now thank God, ninety-nine percent of
them are getting exposed.

00:13:46.779 --> 00:13:52.550
But now new are coming up like mushrooms but
still, if you understand that you can’t

00:13:52.550 --> 00:14:00.399
pay for your evolutionary process, you have
understood me very well.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:08.189
Now what happens when you get your realization
as I told you, the first thing happens that

00:14:08.189 --> 00:14:10.999
you become thoughtlessly aware.

00:14:10.999 --> 00:14:12.470
Is a state.

00:14:12.470 --> 00:14:16.999
In Sanskrit called as nirvichara samadhi.

00:14:16.999 --> 00:14:21.380
The second state is doubtless awareness.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:27.620
When this connection is in the beginning little
loose, so, you have to work it out a little

00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:28.620
bit.

00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:36.079
Once you have worked it out and the connection
becomes really, permanent, then what you find

00:14:36.079 --> 00:14:42.230
is a complete flow of that power within you.

00:14:42.230 --> 00:14:49.820
A new state another a new dimension in your
awareness comes in.

00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:54.509
That on your fingertips you can feel your
centers, means self knowledge.

00:14:54.509 --> 00:14:57.490
You know where what’s the problem is.

00:14:57.490 --> 00:15:06.389
And on the same way, on the same fingers you
can feel the centres of others.

00:15:06.389 --> 00:15:09.189
So you are collectively conscious.

00:15:09.189 --> 00:15:10.829
You know about others.

00:15:10.829 --> 00:15:16.080
You don’t know what sort of dress they are
wearing, what sort of complexion they have,

00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:23.470
what race they come from, but what you know
is what’s wrong with their centre, which

00:15:23.470 --> 00:15:25.629
centre is in jeopardy.

00:15:25.629 --> 00:15:34.360
Now, if you know how to correct those centers,
your problem is solved and the problem of

00:15:34.360 --> 00:15:38.550
others also you can solve.

00:15:38.550 --> 00:15:43.540
In that enlightenment, what do you see?

00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:53.050
You see yourself away from yourself in the
sense that you start seeing, yourself as sometimes

00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.430
as a stupid fellow.

00:15:55.430 --> 00:15:59.459
Sometimes could be you might think, see that
you are doing such wrong things to yourself.

00:15:59.459 --> 00:16:01.279
You are destroying yourself.

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:04.069
In Sahaja Yoga we never say: ‘Don’t do.’

00:16:04.069 --> 00:16:07.600
We never say because half of the people will
run away.

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.629
So we say that alright let’s have the awakening.

00:16:10.629 --> 00:16:14.550
Once you have the awakening then in that light
you see.

00:16:14.550 --> 00:16:16.320
I’ll give an example.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.120
Supposing I’m very obstinate, and think
no end of myself, and is carrying the snake

00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.379
in my hand.

00:16:22.379 --> 00:16:27.769
It’s darkness and somebody tells me that
this is a snake and it will bite you.

00:16:27.769 --> 00:16:29.089
I say: ‘No.

00:16:29.089 --> 00:16:30.410
[WHAT’S THE…del.]

00:16:30.410 --> 00:16:31.740
What’s wrong?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.850
Let me have, but it’s a rope.’

00:16:34.850 --> 00:16:37.800
They said: ‘No, it’s a snake, please throw
it away.’

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:38.800
No.

00:16:38.800 --> 00:16:39.800
Nobody will listen.

00:16:39.800 --> 00:16:44.120
But if little light comes [IN THAT…del.]
in that room or in that hall or wherever it

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.009
is immediately you throw away that snake.

00:16:48.009 --> 00:16:53.930
So you become your own guide, and you understand
yourself and you just give up all these things.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:57.660
Without doing anything you just give it up.

00:16:57.660 --> 00:17:02.740
In England we had great experiences of very
terrible drug addicts.

00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:04.760
Overnight they gave up.

00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:05.760
Overnight.

00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:08.740
It’s very surprising.

00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:14.910
All these problems, in the world today are
because of ignorance.

00:17:14.910 --> 00:17:19.940
Once you have the light you just give up all
these things, without any difficulty, because

00:17:19.940 --> 00:17:23.570
you find they’re destructive.

00:17:23.570 --> 00:17:26.250
One doesn’t have to tell you don’t do
it don’t do it.

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:27.660
It just happens.

00:17:27.660 --> 00:17:29.800
You are empowered.

00:17:29.800 --> 00:17:34.950
That you can control yourself and you know
how to be with yourself.

00:17:34.950 --> 00:17:38.430
But in the same way you can have an effect
on others.

00:17:38.430 --> 00:17:43.380
Supposing two persons are quarreling and a
third person who’s a realized soul goes

00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:51.420
there, suddenly the peace descends on them
and suddenly they give up fighting.

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:58.680
So the power that is all-pervading you should
understand, is such a dynamic power, is the

00:17:58.680 --> 00:18:07.110
ocean of compassion, is the ocean of knowledge,
but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:15.530
So, when we feel very guilty, after realization
you get rid of all these troubles.

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:19.760
People have all kinds of problems incurred
upon themselves.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:24.620
But in this light you see it so clearly and
it manages.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:27.410
It just disappears.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:35.200
Now what is our problem now of this world
is?

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:37.740
A scientist came to argue with me.

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.150
I said: ‘Answer only one question.

00:18:40.150 --> 00:18:43.800
Why are you on this earth?’

00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.660
He didn’t know what to say.

00:18:45.660 --> 00:18:49.860
Madly he is finding out one thing, then another
thing and another thing.

00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:51.710
But I said: ‘Why are you here?

00:18:51.710 --> 00:18:54.720
Just to find these things or is there something
more?’

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.890
Couldn’t understand.

00:18:56.890 --> 00:19:01.880
I said: ‘If I tell you, you’ll be happy
to know, you have to enter into the Kingdom

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:08.580
of God, to enjoy His bliss, to enjoy His love,
to enjoy His bounties.

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:12.990
This is why you are on this Earth.’

00:19:12.990 --> 00:19:17.700
This is what it is, it answers this question
this way.

00:19:17.700 --> 00:19:21.380
The second thing that happens to you.

00:19:21.380 --> 00:19:24.380
That you know Absolute Truth.

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.340
Now supposing, somebody comes from India from
jail.

00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:35.510
And wears a cloth of saffron color and starts
saying some sort of Sanskrit words.

00:19:35.510 --> 00:19:38.190
He’ll become a big guru anywhere.

00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:42.460
Because he shows off like that you see, carries
a drum of that kind.

00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:44.230
He’ll become a big guru.

00:19:44.230 --> 00:19:49.590
How will you know whether he’s a thief or
not?

00:19:49.590 --> 00:19:54.270
What you have to do is to just put your hands
if you are realised souls.

00:19:54.270 --> 00:19:57.950
Immediately you will feel, the burning of
this fellow.

00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:00.400
Immediately you’ll know what sort of chakras
he is.

00:20:00.400 --> 00:20:02.070
How cunning he is.

00:20:02.070 --> 00:20:03.070
Immediately.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:05.740
And after some times you don’t even have
to put your hands towards him.

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:10.340
Immediately you’ll know what sort of person
he is, what are his centers in danger, what

00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:12.060
is happening to him.

00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:19.320
Thus you can cure also physical ailments of
yourself and of others.

00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:20.320
You are so relaxed.

00:20:20.320 --> 00:20:22.520
Now see, I’m seventy-one years of age.

00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.770
I’ve been coming to Perth, I don’t know
how many years I’ve been coming here.

00:20:27.770 --> 00:20:31.940
And I’m travelling like this, I’m quite
all right.

00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:34.320
Because, you don’t worry.

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:36.370
You are so relaxed.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.460
I mean people say: ‘Mother, you are traveling
so much.’

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:44.380
I say: ‘I never travel, I’m just sitting
in the aeroplane, that’s all I know.’

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:46.630
If I start thinking: ‘I’m traveling, I’m
this.’

00:20:46.630 --> 00:20:47.630
I never travel.

00:20:47.630 --> 00:20:51.580
I’m just sitting nicely, I’m sitting here
in the same, in the drawing room, I’m sitting

00:20:51.580 --> 00:20:52.580
there.

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:53.990
What is there like travelling?

00:20:53.990 --> 00:20:57.230
What’s so special.

00:20:57.230 --> 00:21:06.110
Like that you see you become so relaxed, in
your peace, that you don’t feel, your age,

00:21:06.110 --> 00:21:09.880
you become so dynamic, and you become so compassionate.

00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:13.890
You become extremely compassionate.

00:21:13.890 --> 00:21:17.710
You become a very different person, very beautiful
person.

00:21:17.710 --> 00:21:25.150
I’ve seen who are married in Sahaja Yoga,
people, are such good husband and wife.

00:21:25.150 --> 00:21:26.840
Hardly any divorce.

00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.670
One per cent maybe.

00:21:28.670 --> 00:21:32.370
And they have beautiful children, who are
born realised.

00:21:32.370 --> 00:21:34.520
In your Perth also you have some of them.

00:21:34.520 --> 00:21:36.820
You should meet them, you’ll be happy to
meet them.

00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:42.040
And so many problems which are so superficial
also pass out.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.370
Children become so dynamic.

00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:49.320
I know one of my relations had some problems
so he came to see Me.

00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:50.320
And he got cured.

00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.980
When he went back he told his son that I got
cured because of this.

00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:56.720
So he said: ‘Alright, now I’m going to
do Sahaja Yoga.’

00:21:56.720 --> 00:22:02.201
That boy, they had complained he’s not good
for studies and he stood first in the whole

00:22:02.201 --> 00:22:10.220
of Uttar Pradesh State, such a huge place,
millions and millions appear for that matriculation

00:22:10.220 --> 00:22:11.220
of theirs.

00:22:11.220 --> 00:22:12.300
He stood first.

00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.500
In our whole family nobody has come first.

00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:16.460
We have first class, first many.

00:22:16.460 --> 00:22:20.700
But not in the whole of UP, something so remarkable.

00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:24.000
And the parents are surprised this boy never
used to study much.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:29.980
Now he’s taken life so well, he’s so matured,
he’s so sensible.

00:22:29.980 --> 00:22:33.970
This shows that all your capacities get enlightenment.

00:22:33.970 --> 00:22:38.670
I’ve known, of very great artists coming
out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:22:38.670 --> 00:22:43.710
In your Sydney also you have one girl who’s
gained a very big name out.

00:22:43.710 --> 00:22:48.720
Then there are musicians, small children who
are becoming great musicians.

00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.980
There are artists, there are musicians, there
are poets, orators, authors.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:59.280
Suddenly, all their capacities start expressing
themselves.

00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:04.760
There’s a fellow who is a chartered accountant,
he said I’ve never know any language very

00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:05.760
well.

00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:06.760
I’m a mathematician.

00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:08.730
He writes such beautiful poems.

00:23:08.730 --> 00:23:10.250
That is surprising.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:11.730
How does he write?

00:23:11.730 --> 00:23:18.020
Now the last song that they sung was written
in the sixteenth century by a tailor, who

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:23.770
got his realization and is the song says:
‘Oh Mother, give my yoga’ – means this

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:25.760
union with the Divine.

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:29.990
They are singing in the villages, everywhere
in India, but nobody knows what it means.

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:33.200
They don’t know what it means.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:39.300
Because of Western education we have given
up all that is our, old knowledge, everything.

00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.980
And we never bothered, to know what we have
in our country.

00:23:44.980 --> 00:23:49.060
This Western life has increased so much, it
has grown so big.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.890
Like a tree that becomes very big.

00:23:52.890 --> 00:23:57.220
But it should seek its own roots, and it must
gets its nourishment.

00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:01.920
If this is the knowledge of the roots, why
should we deny it.

00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:03.290
Is very important.

00:24:03.290 --> 00:24:10.320
As we learn science, from the West, the West
must learn, the knowledge of the roots.

00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:14.790
And if it can be proved then why not?

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:21.070
Now there are three doctors who have got MD
degrees for Sahaja Yoga.

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:25.790
One has done on epilepsy, another has done
on physical fitness, third one has done on

00:24:25.790 --> 00:24:27.450
cancer or something.

00:24:27.450 --> 00:24:30.740
So now they have got MDs.

00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:34.350
And there’s the fourth one who’s doing
some other research.

00:24:34.350 --> 00:24:36.170
Asthma.

00:24:36.170 --> 00:24:37.410
And they are very successful.

00:24:37.410 --> 00:24:39.910
You don’t have to pay anything.

00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:42.330
No medicine, nothing.

00:24:42.330 --> 00:24:44.860
Just it works through your own powers.

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:48.210
About which you have no knowledge.

00:24:48.210 --> 00:24:50.970
You don’t know what this power is like.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.300
What it can give you.

00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:57.240
So your attention itself becomes enlightened.

00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:02.260
You pay attention to anyone after you have
achieved the state of thoughtless awareness,

00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:07.230
doubtless awareness, then you will know what’s
wrong with that person.

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:13.040
Even of the dead, you will know what’s wrong
with that person.

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.880
Physically you will find out what’s wrong.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.450
Mentally you will find out and spiritually
you can find out.

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:26.280
And all these three dimensions in us can found
out by ourselves and can be improved.

00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:31.490
In the same way we can improve others through
our attention.

00:25:31.490 --> 00:25:39.530
So dynamic, are our powers within ourselves.

00:25:39.530 --> 00:25:42.800
And that’s what I’m saying we have to
know our glory.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:47.150
For example this instrument, if it is not
connected to the mains it has no identity,

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:48.710
it has no meaning.

00:25:48.710 --> 00:25:54.130
In the same way if we are not connected to
this, all-pervading power we have no meaning

00:25:54.130 --> 00:25:55.300
to our life.

00:25:55.300 --> 00:26:01.690
So people are trying to find identification
by coloring [COLORING…del.] their hair,

00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.380
doing all kinds of things they do for identification.

00:26:04.380 --> 00:26:06.520
Thank God it’s over now, all those.

00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:08.770
Most of the fads are over.

00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.770
Otherwise they used to always say one mantra:
‘What’s wrong?

00:26:11.770 --> 00:26:12.840
What’s wrong?’

00:26:12.840 --> 00:26:16.800
When you are wasting your energy, time: ‘What’s
wrong?’

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:22.850
Thank God recession has put them down a little
bit and they are not doing all these horrible

00:26:22.850 --> 00:26:24.380
things they used to do.

00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:27.740
So now the attention is more introspective.

00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:29.070
I think so.

00:26:29.070 --> 00:26:33.280
Of the young people especially I was shocked
the way some of the young people in England

00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:39.400
were doing this, what do you call that I’ve
forgotten, with the red hair business and

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:48.010
wasting fifty pounds for that kind of a hairdress
which was quite funny you know and, they started

00:26:48.010 --> 00:26:49.410
becoming blind.

00:26:49.410 --> 00:26:53.730
So I said: ‘Why do you want to put this
horrible color, you are becoming blind?’

00:26:53.730 --> 00:26:55.500
So they said: ‘What’s wrong?

00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:56.500
Nothing wrong.’

00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:59.770
Even if you say they are going to die: ‘So
what’s wrong?

00:26:59.770 --> 00:27:02.190
In any way we have to die.’

00:27:02.190 --> 00:27:08.720
I mean the whole brain had taken a recession
into itself.

00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:12.640
It would not understand anything sensible.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:18.460
But now somehow or other, people are maturing
and trying to understand that identity is

00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:21.360
within ourselves.

00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.660
Like now take a say a good television set
and take it to some remote village in India,

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:30.410
where they have never seen electricity.

00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:34.440
And you tell them that from this you can see
films and things they’ll say: ‘Oh, now

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.380
you are telling us stories.

00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:37.840
It’s just a box.’

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.080
That’s how we think we are just a box.

00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:47.560
Unless and until we are connected, we cannot
know how great we are.

00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:53.770
And that’s how we start condemning ourselves,
suffering from depression, this, that frustration.

00:27:53.770 --> 00:27:55.910
These are all artificial.

00:27:55.910 --> 00:28:01.171
And they just drop out once you know what
you are, what is your capacity, what you can

00:28:01.171 --> 00:28:06.380
do, what are your powers.

00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:10.870
So that, you get awakened and you can awaken
others also.

00:28:10.870 --> 00:28:15.260
This is another power you get that you can
awaken other people.

00:28:15.260 --> 00:28:19.420
You don’t have to ask Me to do that.

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:21.320
Anybody who is enlightened can do it.

00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:25.410
Like one candle which is enlightened can enlighten
hundred candles.

00:28:25.410 --> 00:28:28.070
In the same way you can also do it.

00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:33.210
And once you start doing it the joy is tremendous.

00:28:33.210 --> 00:28:38.760
Here in Perth we have many people who are
Sahaja Yogis and they are doing this work

00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:39.760
here.

00:28:39.760 --> 00:28:41.790
When I come only once a year here.

00:28:41.790 --> 00:28:47.450
But I find that gradually they are maturing
very well.

00:28:47.450 --> 00:28:49.020
And they have all the knowledge.

00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:56.130
All the knowledge about yourself, about your
antaratma is called, the inside.

00:28:56.130 --> 00:28:59.330
You should know everything about yourselves
and about others.

00:28:59.330 --> 00:29:00.850
Not the outside.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:02.580
But the inside of it.

00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:03.580
What is it?

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:04.580
Why?

00:29:04.580 --> 00:29:05.580
Why do I behave like this?

00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:06.610
Why do I accept this?

00:29:06.610 --> 00:29:08.130
Why I don’t accept like that?

00:29:08.130 --> 00:29:13.380
You see your ego, you see all your conditionings,
you see everything clearly and you understand

00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:17.610
what is good for you and you have power to
give up what you want to give up.

00:29:17.610 --> 00:29:19.080
You are not powerless.

00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.490
You are not under any habit.

00:29:21.490 --> 00:29:24.350
All the habits drop out.

00:29:24.350 --> 00:29:31.230
The best part of it, best part of it I would
say that you know absolute truth.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:35.970
Also you can help others because in collective
consciousness you are there.

00:29:35.970 --> 00:29:37.260
Your attention is enlightened.

00:29:37.260 --> 00:29:44.620
But the best is that you jump into the ocean
of joy.

00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:47.170
Joy is singular.

00:29:47.170 --> 00:29:49.550
It is not like happiness and unhappiness.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:53.480
Supposing somebody pampers our ego we are
very happy you see.

00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:55.960
Somebody punctures it we are very unhappy.

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:57.660
But with joy you become a witness.

00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.770
You see the whole thing as a witness.

00:30:00.770 --> 00:30:06.440
And you are in a state where just you enjoy
everything.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.780
Everything is so enjoyable, only thing little
bit, your vision is marred.

00:30:11.780 --> 00:30:18.140
Once you get that, that joy, then nothing
can make you miserable.

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.181
If you see a problem of course you face it.

00:30:20.181 --> 00:30:22.890
You face it bravely.

00:30:22.890 --> 00:30:24.820
And you are not bothered.

00:30:24.820 --> 00:30:29.650
And you are surprised that how you are helped
by so many blessings.

00:30:29.650 --> 00:30:34.190
If you have to believe in yourself the blessings
come to you.

00:30:34.190 --> 00:30:37.080
But you have to have faith in yourself.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:40.600
Because also there’s a tendency: ‘Oh Mother,
I’m a sinner.

00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.600
I’m this that.’

00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:43.060
You see there’s nothing like that.

00:30:43.060 --> 00:30:47.040
It’s all nonsense, people talk about sin,
sin, sin, sin.

00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:49.180
After all you’re human beings.

00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:50.180
You are not gods.

00:30:50.180 --> 00:30:52.070
If you have done mistakes, so what?

00:30:52.070 --> 00:30:53.680
What does it matter?

00:30:53.680 --> 00:31:00.090
After all, this great power is there, which
is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:31:00.090 --> 00:31:02.040
Ocean of forgiveness.

00:31:02.040 --> 00:31:08.590
You don’t have to really torture yourself,
and go on saying as this is wrong with me

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:11.370
that is wrong with me.

00:31:11.370 --> 00:31:17.830
Just have faith in yourself I’m telling
you and I’m sure this will work out tonight.

00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:22.410
Of course I must say, that I respect your
freedom.

00:31:22.410 --> 00:31:23.820
It cannot be forced on you.

00:31:23.820 --> 00:31:25.470
It cannot be.

00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.970
I respect your freedom.

00:31:27.970 --> 00:31:31.020
And as a result it is you who has to say yes.

00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.000
I cannot force on you.

00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.630
So those who don’t want to have their realization
have to go away.

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:40.490
It helps you physically, mentally, emotionally.

00:31:40.490 --> 00:31:44.200
I assure you it does.

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:47.200
Also spiritually it helps you a lot.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.200
It works.

00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.640
It’s your own power.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.640
No doubt.

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.390
And there’s no complication with it, at
all.

00:31:54.390 --> 00:31:57.340
No complication of any kind.

00:31:57.340 --> 00:32:01.380
But if you don’t want to have it, how can
I force it on you?

00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:02.920
It cannot be forced.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:10.970
It’s a living process, of your choice, the
last breakthrough of your evolution.

00:32:10.970 --> 00:32:19.480
That’s what I request you, that you should
just decide on this point yourself.

00:32:19.480 --> 00:32:22.290
All religions have talked about it.

00:32:22.290 --> 00:32:26.360
Christ has said: ‘Know thyself.’

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:32.390
In the Bible it is: ‘I’ll appear before
you like flames, like silent flames.’

00:32:32.390 --> 00:32:34.870
You do see those chakras like that.

00:32:34.870 --> 00:32:39.860
Every…Buddha has said it, everyone has said
the same thing.

00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:45.110
Even in the Koran it is written that: ‘At
the time of resurrection, kiama, your hands

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:48.570
will speak and they’ll give witness against
you.’

00:32:48.570 --> 00:32:52.960
I mean He has said it, much more clearly than
anybody else.

00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.110
So all the religions have said that you have
to know yourself.

00:32:57.110 --> 00:32:58.180
No doubt about it.

00:32:58.180 --> 00:33:03.060
But no [RELIGION HAS …del.] outside religion
has tried that.

00:33:03.060 --> 00:33:07.530
Nobody has tried to tell people you have to
know yourself.

00:33:07.530 --> 00:33:12.110
They all have become either power oriented
or money oriented, not spirit oriented.

00:33:12.110 --> 00:33:14.450
That’s the problem is.

00:33:14.450 --> 00:33:20.320
So I would request people who don’t want
to have realization to go away, because it

00:33:20.320 --> 00:33:21.320
won’t work out.

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:22.970
If you are not there it won’t.

00:33:22.970 --> 00:33:27.940
It doesn’t work for people who are adamant,
who are arrogant, also for people who are

00:33:27.940 --> 00:33:31.620
idiots you see, it doesn’t work out.

00:33:31.620 --> 00:33:34.530
I’m sorry to say.

00:33:34.530 --> 00:33:40.090
If you have some problem, physical, mental,
emotional, even spiritual then maybe, it might

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.500
be delayed but everybody gets it.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.490
So far I’ve seen anybody who has come to
Sahaja Yoga has got it.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:50.420
And got it very well.

00:33:50.420 --> 00:33:58.070
So, I would request you … I know you all
have some questions also.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.410
To be asked.

00:34:00.410 --> 00:34:05.750
But I would say that, it is better that you
write them and send it over to Me.

00:34:05.750 --> 00:34:12.429
Because just now the whole atmosphere is built
in and I think people should get their realization

00:34:12.429 --> 00:34:13.460
first.

00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:15.649
Then you’ll have no questions.

00:34:15.649 --> 00:34:21.050
Because questions you see now, I’ve been
working for about twenty-three years, I know

00:34:21.050 --> 00:34:24.240
all these mental acrobats, I know.

00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:27.490
I can answer every question very well.

00:34:27.490 --> 00:34:28.890
Make you laugh also.

00:34:28.890 --> 00:34:35.370
But, the main thing is realization and if
you have this mental diversion then perhaps

00:34:35.370 --> 00:34:37.210
maybe, you might miss the point.

00:34:37.210 --> 00:34:42.090
So the best thing is that you get your realization
which is your right and then, we’ll talk

00:34:42.090 --> 00:35:04.800
about it.

00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.040
Now what one has to do is to take out the
shoes that’s all.

00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:15.590
It’s not a too much of a thing doing this.

00:35:15.590 --> 00:35:29.410
Because this Mother Earth takes away our problems.

00:35:29.410 --> 00:35:38.410
So now we are on our way, to know how fantastic
we are and to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:35:38.410 --> 00:35:42.180
So we have to be very kind to ourselves.

00:35:42.180 --> 00:35:47.310
See actually, I think, we must really have
respect for ourselves.

00:35:47.310 --> 00:35:48.870
Very important.

00:35:48.870 --> 00:35:54.550
There are three conditions.

00:35:54.550 --> 00:36:03.760
The first one is, that, you have to forgive
yourself.

00:36:03.760 --> 00:36:05.940
Just forgive yourself.

00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:08.300
Means you should not feel guilty, at all.

00:36:08.300 --> 00:36:14.140
Perhaps you don’t know if you feel guilty
what happens is on the left side this centre

00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:19.070
catches and that gives you spondylitis.

00:36:19.070 --> 00:36:24.130
It might also give you angina and maybe lethargic
organs.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:27.440
It’s a terrible thing to have this centre
caught up.

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:30.370
So what’s the need to feel guilty?

00:36:30.370 --> 00:36:34.690
I mean in anyway you are punishing yourself
for nothing at all.

00:36:34.690 --> 00:36:36.260
So please don’t feel guilty.

00:36:36.260 --> 00:36:39.920
I mean people feel guilty for all kinds of
nonsensical things.

00:36:39.920 --> 00:36:42.740
Like somebody spilled, say coffee.

00:36:42.740 --> 00:36:43.740
Finished.

00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:47.350
All his life he’ll remember: ‘Oh my God,
I spilled the coffee on the carpet.’

00:36:47.350 --> 00:36:52.360
It’s nothing important.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:54.240
So please don’t feel guilty.

00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.450
That’s one point.

00:36:55.450 --> 00:37:02.320
That’s very important because if this centre
is caught up the Kundalini won’t rise.

00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.660
Now the second condition is, that you have
to forgive everyone.

00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:10.110
Now some say it’s very difficult to forgive
anyone.

00:37:10.110 --> 00:37:13.990
Logically whether you forgive or don’t forgive
you don’t do anything.

00:37:13.990 --> 00:37:17.360
What do you do?

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.630
Nothing.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:22.890
But actually you play into wrong hands.

00:37:22.890 --> 00:37:29.260
The persons who have harmed you or troubled
you or made you unhappy, are happy.

00:37:29.260 --> 00:37:33.150
While you are torturing yourself.

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.570
Logically.

00:37:34.570 --> 00:37:37.990
So why torture yourself for nothing at all?

00:37:37.990 --> 00:37:41.230
Don’t even think about them.

00:37:41.230 --> 00:37:46.150
To just say in general: ‘Mother, I forgive
everyone.’

00:37:46.150 --> 00:37:47.150
Just say it.

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:48.490
And it will be done.

00:37:48.490 --> 00:37:51.300
You’ll feel much lighter, I tell you.

00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.510
Must forgive.

00:37:53.510 --> 00:38:06.650
There’s a way to understand that, at this
moment you have to be free from all this nonsense.

00:38:06.650 --> 00:38:07.650
Why?

00:38:07.650 --> 00:38:10.310
Because this center is, like this – agnya.

00:38:10.310 --> 00:38:13.280
The optic chiasma goes like this.

00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.010
[SHRI MATAJI DEMONSTRATES] Like that it is.

00:38:17.010 --> 00:38:21.250
If you don’t forgive it won’t open.

00:38:21.250 --> 00:38:26.920
Now, it has to open like this, if the Kundalini
has to pass through it.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:30.540
Now if you don’t forgive, this will remain
like this.

00:38:30.540 --> 00:38:36.480
All your life you have tortured yourself and
at this moment you’ll miss the point.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.800
So why not forgive?

00:38:37.800 --> 00:38:40.130
Just forgive.

00:38:40.130 --> 00:38:41.130
Forgive everyone.

00:38:41.130 --> 00:38:43.070
And third.

00:38:43.070 --> 00:38:45.400
The most important.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:51.730
Is the condition that you all should have
confidence that you all can get your realization.

00:38:51.730 --> 00:38:56.690
Whether you belong to Australia, India or
Timbuktu.

00:38:56.690 --> 00:39:00.950
You all can get your realization tonight.

00:39:00.950 --> 00:39:02.930
This is very important.

00:39:02.930 --> 00:39:05.790
Have confidence in yourself.

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:11.330
Moreover, you have to know that this is not
an individual happening.

00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:14.640
It’s not that you are getting your realization
and another isn’t.

00:39:14.640 --> 00:39:15.690
It’s ‘en masse’.

00:39:15.690 --> 00:39:18.920
That’s the new thing is an ‘en masse’
realization.

00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:22.640
Say in Russia sixteen thousand people get
realization.

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:24.760
How it has worked out?

00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:26.000
We should say God alone knows.

00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:27.770
But it has worked out.

00:39:27.770 --> 00:39:35.180
Now, once it happens, to you, you cannot sit
at home and say: ‘Oh yes Mother, I’m meditating.’

00:39:35.180 --> 00:39:36.180
No, no.

00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:37.900
You have to come to the collective.

00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:39.370
You don’t have to pay anything.

00:39:39.370 --> 00:39:40.370
No, no, no.

00:39:40.370 --> 00:39:44.980
It’s not that this is introduction letter
and then your purses are polished off.

00:39:44.980 --> 00:39:47.070
It’s not like that.

00:39:47.070 --> 00:39:50.490
It is, it is just you have to attend.

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:53.890
You have to go for meditation with others,
collectively.

00:39:53.890 --> 00:39:56.570
It’s a collective happening.

00:39:56.570 --> 00:40:00.150
Supposing a nail is taken out of your finger.

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.400
It will never grow.

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.650
In the same way it’s a collective happening.

00:40:03.650 --> 00:40:06.670
And Sahaja Yoga is working in sixty nations.

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.530
And the thousands and thousands of people
who are self realized.

00:40:10.530 --> 00:40:13.680
They are all your part and parcel.

00:40:13.680 --> 00:40:19.360
If one person gets into trouble in any place,
all of them will jump at it and try to see

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:21.960
that that person is saved.

00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:24.570
So you have so many brothers and sisters.

00:40:24.570 --> 00:40:26.300
Real brothers and sisters I should say.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.290
They are not only blood relations but they
are spirit relations.

00:40:31.290 --> 00:40:37.280
So, I have to request, that please don’t
finish it here.

00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:42.490
Stephen told me he has a funny experience
of the Australians but it’s common with

00:40:42.490 --> 00:40:44.220
everyone I must say.

00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:48.970
That some people get it a very high experience
so they forget it.

00:40:48.970 --> 00:40:54.070
They just enjoy it for while, til after one
year they come down when You are here and

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:55.470
they are not bothered.

00:40:55.470 --> 00:40:59.110
But those who get little bit they just come
and say now what’s in it.

00:40:59.110 --> 00:41:00.790
I’m getting burning here.

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.560
I’m doing this.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:03.560
Why?

00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:12.110
But those who get it in a big way should,
become easily doubtlessly aware people and

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.400
they have so many powers.

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.190
And they should do a lot.

00:41:16.190 --> 00:41:17.190
Why?

00:41:17.190 --> 00:41:20.820
They should help others who are feeling little
bit less.

00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:25.340
So it is something, human nature I think,
the way it acts.

00:41:25.340 --> 00:41:27.140
But it’s not Divine nature.

00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:34.730
Divine nature is when you become Divine, then
you want to give.

00:41:34.730 --> 00:41:35.730
You have the light.

00:41:35.730 --> 00:41:36.730
You want to give.

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:41.270
Till this candle was not enlightened it was
alright, it was trying to get enlightened.

00:41:41.270 --> 00:41:43.940
Once it was enlightened it is giving light.

00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:48.010
When you have the light you have to give it
to others.

00:41:48.010 --> 00:41:50.710
And that’s what is the most enjoyable thing.

00:41:50.710 --> 00:41:54.040
For that you don’t have to pay, again.

00:41:54.040 --> 00:42:00.820
But you have to give some time to yourself,
some respect to yourself, and some meaning

00:42:00.820 --> 00:42:01.980
to your life.

00:42:01.980 --> 00:42:07.740
You’ll be amazed how it will give you such
a joy that you can do all these things.

00:42:07.740 --> 00:42:10.280
May God Bless You.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:14.230
Now, I’ve told you again three conditions.

00:42:14.230 --> 00:42:20.310
And I hope you have understood my three conditions
are very simple if you look at it because

00:42:20.310 --> 00:42:23.380
all these things are there because of a myth.

00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:25.630
It’s a myth.

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:29.170
That to feel guilty is a myth.

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:31.500
Not to forgive others is a myth.

00:42:31.500 --> 00:42:34.380
And not to have confidence is another myth.

00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.910
So we should get out of this and we should
have full confidence that we’ll get our

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:39.910
realization.

00:42:39.910 --> 00:42:42.530
You all can get it I promise you.

00:42:42.530 --> 00:42:44.990
All of you.

00:42:44.990 --> 00:42:52.930
I hope you have taken out your shoes.

00:42:52.930 --> 00:43:00.560
As Stephen has already told you there are
two powers, left and right, we have to put

00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:06.840
both our feet like this on the Mother Earth.

00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:10.970
Alright.

00:43:10.970 --> 00:43:17.460
Now, please take out your shoes that’s all.

00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:24.470
Now you have to put both the hands towards
Me like that.

00:43:24.470 --> 00:43:30.050
Keep your eyes open.

00:43:30.050 --> 00:43:33.160
For the time being.

00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:37.260
You should be comfortable.

00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:39.320
Very comfortable.

00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:54.280
There should be no discomfort in your body.

00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:00.840
Now please put your left hand towards me – on
your lap you can put it or sideways wherever

00:44:00.840 --> 00:44:05.310
you feel comfortable and the right hand on
your heart.

00:44:05.310 --> 00:44:12.400
Keep your eyes open because just now I’ll
tell you what is to be done.

00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:17.680
This we have just to do that you should know
how we are clearing your centers.

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:23.070
Now we are working only on the left side with
your right hand and the left hand is towards

00:44:23.070 --> 00:44:28.181
Me which indicates that you have a desire
because this is the power of desire, that

00:44:28.181 --> 00:44:30.850
you have a desire that you get your realization.

00:44:30.850 --> 00:44:38.500
So please put your right hand on your heart
now.

00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:44.880
In the heart resides the spirit.

00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:50.960
Now you take your right hand upper portion
of your abdomen on the left hand side and

00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:53.230
press it.

00:44:53.230 --> 00:44:59.220
If you are the spirit you become your own
master and this is the centre of your mastery

00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:09.910
which is created by great masters, and prophets.

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:15.250
Now please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:45:15.250 --> 00:45:21.300
This is the centre of pure knowledge.

00:45:21.300 --> 00:45:28.530
Means the knowledge about the laws which are
Divine.

00:45:28.530 --> 00:45:34.700
Surprisingly the center is so low as that.

00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:41.550
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion
of your abdomen again.

00:45:41.550 --> 00:45:44.960
Then onto your heart.

00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:54.730
Now raise your right hand in the corner of
your shoulder and your neck and put your head

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.180
to your right.

00:45:57.180 --> 00:46:06.050
This is the center I’ve told you when you
feel guilty gets into jeopardy.

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:16.530
Now please take your right hand on top of
your forehead across, and put down your head.

00:46:16.530 --> 00:46:21.270
This is the center where we have to forgive
everyone which we’ll do later on.

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:23.250
I’m just telling you now.

00:46:23.250 --> 00:46:29.010
Now please take your right hand on the back
side of your head and push back your head.

00:46:29.010 --> 00:46:36.590
Just for your satisfaction, here you have
to ask for forgiveness from the Divine Power.

00:46:36.590 --> 00:46:37.690
Now the last center.

00:46:37.690 --> 00:46:40.410
Is very important.

00:46:40.410 --> 00:46:47.240
Stretch your hand fully and put the center
of your hand on top of the fontanel bone area

00:46:47.240 --> 00:46:51.470
which was the soft bone on our head.

00:46:51.470 --> 00:46:55.250
So now put down your head a little bit.

00:46:55.250 --> 00:47:01.500
As far as possible if you can put it would
be nice.

00:47:01.500 --> 00:47:08.610
Now press it hard by pushing back your fingers
and move your scalp.

00:47:08.610 --> 00:47:12.390
Move your scalp more, clockwise.

00:47:12.390 --> 00:47:13.400
Seven times.

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:23.270
Please move your clockwise hand to move the
scalp – seven times.

00:47:23.270 --> 00:47:24.890
Put down your head please.

00:47:24.890 --> 00:47:28.670
That’s all you have to do.

00:47:28.670 --> 00:47:30.990
That’s all.

00:47:30.990 --> 00:47:34.470
More than sufficient.

00:47:34.470 --> 00:47:43.600
Now, you can call Me Shri Mataji or Mother,
whatever suits you.

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:49.040
Take out your spectacles will be better because,
it might help your eyesight also.

00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.340
Now close your eyes.

00:47:52.340 --> 00:47:53.530
Please close your eyes.

00:47:53.530 --> 00:48:00.470
Put left hand towards Me, right hand on the
heart and put both the feet apart from each

00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:01.900
other.

00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:05.400
Be comfortable.

00:48:05.400 --> 00:48:16.010
Now, here you have to ask Me a very fundamental
question about yourself.

00:48:16.010 --> 00:48:18.510
Ask a question: ‘Mother am I the spirit?’

00:48:18.510 --> 00:48:20.170
Ask the question in your heart.

00:48:20.170 --> 00:48:24.950
‘Mother am I the spirit?’

00:48:24.950 --> 00:48:35.950
Ask three times.

00:48:35.950 --> 00:48:44.400
Now, as I told you if you are the spirit you
become your own master.

00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:51.270
Now please take your right hand, on the upper
portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

00:48:51.270 --> 00:49:02.609
and press it and here you ask another question
three times: ‘Mother, am I my own master?’

00:49:02.609 --> 00:49:18.770
I’ve told you that I respect your freedom
and you have to ask for pure knowledge.

00:49:18.770 --> 00:49:20.380
I cannot force it on you.

00:49:20.380 --> 00:49:25.300
So please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:49:25.300 --> 00:49:37.010
Here now press it hard and ask another question:
Again six times because, this center has got

00:49:37.010 --> 00:49:39.609
six petals.

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:50.980
Ask six times for, pure knowledge: ‘Mother
please give me pure knowledge.’

00:49:50.980 --> 00:50:07.660
Ask six times.

00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:13.760
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge the
kundalini starts rising.

00:50:13.760 --> 00:50:20.160
So, we have to open our upper centers with
full confidence.

00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:22.410
Have full confidence in yourself.

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:27.910
Now please raise your right hand the upper
portion of your abdomen, on the left-hand

00:50:27.910 --> 00:50:31.630
side.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:45.680
Here, with full confidence you have to say
ten times: ‘Mother, I am my own master.’

00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:47.380
Please say this ten times.

00:50:47.380 --> 00:50:50.520
‘Mother, I am my own master.’

00:50:50.520 --> 00:51:01.840
With full confidence.

00:51:01.840 --> 00:51:05.840
I have already told you that you are the pure
spirit.

00:51:05.840 --> 00:51:11.940
You are not this body, mind, emotions, egos,
conditionings.

00:51:11.940 --> 00:51:14.530
But you are the pure spirit.

00:51:14.530 --> 00:51:19.710
So now please put your right hand on your
heart and with full confidence you have to

00:51:19.710 --> 00:51:30.420
say, twelve times in your heart: ‘Mother
I am the pure spirit.’

00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:47.800
Please say it, with full confidence.

00:51:47.800 --> 00:51:55.590
I have already told you that this all-pervading
power is the ocean of knowledge, ocean of

00:51:55.590 --> 00:52:00.550
blessings but above all it is the ocean of
forgiveness.

00:52:00.550 --> 00:52:05.970
So please forgive yourself and raise your
hand in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:13.230
and, on the left-hand side and turn your head
to your right.

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:20.869
Here you have to say with full confidence:
‘Mother I am not guilty, Mother I am not

00:52:20.869 --> 00:52:21.869
guilty.’

00:52:21.869 --> 00:52:27.780
Please say it, sixteen times.

00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:33.150
I have already told you, if you forgive or
don’t forgive you don’t do anything.

00:52:33.150 --> 00:52:39.290
But if you don’t forgive then, you play
into wrong hands and at this moment it’s

00:52:39.290 --> 00:52:45.480
very important that you forgive because this
center of agnya is very constricted and has

00:52:45.480 --> 00:52:47.230
to be opened out.

00:52:47.230 --> 00:52:50.109
So please help yourself.

00:52:50.109 --> 00:52:57.109
Now, raise your right hand on top of your
forehead across and please put down your head

00:52:57.109 --> 00:53:00.080
as far as possible.

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:12.130
Here, it’s not how many times, but from
your heart you have to say: ‘Mother I forgive

00:53:12.130 --> 00:53:15.890
everyone.’

00:53:15.890 --> 00:53:20.700
Not how many times but from your heart: ‘Mother
I forgive everyone.’

00:53:20.700 --> 00:53:23.190
In general.

00:53:23.190 --> 00:53:25.140
You don’t remember each and every person.

00:53:25.140 --> 00:53:28.660
You don’t have to think about any one of
them.

00:53:28.660 --> 00:53:31.630
Just say in general from your heart.

00:53:31.630 --> 00:53:35.970
This is very important.

00:53:35.970 --> 00:53:46.530
Now, only for your satisfaction, without feeling
guilty, without counting your mistakes, please

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:54.320
put your right hand on the back side of your
head and push back your head.

00:53:54.320 --> 00:54:07.660
Here, again you have to say from your heart,
not how many times: ‘Oh Divine Power, if

00:54:07.660 --> 00:54:11.869
I have done any mistakes please forgive me.’

00:54:11.869 --> 00:54:14.020
Just say that for your satisfaction.

00:54:14.020 --> 00:54:17.130
Don’t feel guilty about it.

00:54:17.130 --> 00:54:24.700
From your heart please say: ‘Oh Divine Power,
if I have done any mistake knowingly or unknowingly

00:54:24.700 --> 00:54:25.700
please forgive me.’

00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:38.250
Please push back your head.

00:54:38.250 --> 00:54:40.920
Now the last center.

00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:47.640
Please stretch your hand fully, your palm
specially and put the center of your palm

00:54:47.640 --> 00:54:53.050
on top of the fontanel bone area, which was
a soft bone in your childhood.

00:54:53.050 --> 00:55:00.490
Now, push back your fingers – very important,
that will give a nice pressure, now put down

00:55:00.490 --> 00:55:01.690
your head.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:07.170
Here again I cannot, cross over your freedom.

00:55:07.170 --> 00:55:09.880
You have to ask for your self-realization.

00:55:09.880 --> 00:55:11.900
I cannot force it on you.

00:55:11.900 --> 00:55:21.280
So please try to move your hand clockwise,
seven times so that the scalp moves, nicely,

00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:27.350
with the pressure and here you have to say,
seven times: ‘Mother, please give me my

00:55:27.350 --> 00:55:28.490
self-realization.’

00:55:28.490 --> 00:56:03.310
[SHRI MATAJI BREATHES INTO THE MICROPHONE]
Now please take down your hands.

00:56:03.310 --> 00:56:15.530
Open your eyes slowly and put both the hands
towards Me like that.

00:56:15.530 --> 00:56:24.650
Now, put the right hand towards Me and put
down your head and see with your left hand

00:56:24.650 --> 00:56:30.440
if there’s a cool or a hot breeze coming
out of your fontanel bone area.

00:56:30.440 --> 00:56:35.480
Don’t put it on top – above, above it.

00:56:35.480 --> 00:56:38.940
Some people get it close and some people get
it very far.

00:56:38.940 --> 00:56:44.720
So just try to see if there’s a hot or a
cold breeze coming out of your head.

00:56:44.720 --> 00:56:47.560
This is the heat coming out of you.

00:56:47.560 --> 00:56:55.190
If you have not forgiven the heat will be
there so please try to forgive now.

00:56:55.190 --> 00:56:59.200
Now please put left hand towards Me.

00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:02.790
Now bend your head again and see for yourself.

00:57:02.790 --> 00:57:05.080
You have to see yourself, nobody’s going
to certify.

00:57:05.080 --> 00:57:09.650
Please see if there’s a hot or a cool breeze
coming out of your head.

00:57:09.650 --> 00:57:14.480
Again I would request you to forgive everyone
so that heat goes away.

00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:24.210
Ultimately it will become cool, very cool.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:42.230
Now lastly, with the right hand.

00:57:42.230 --> 00:57:45.359
Now raise your both the hands towards the
sky.

00:57:45.359 --> 00:57:50.050
Push back your head and ask one question,
one of these questions three times.

00:57:50.050 --> 00:57:54.740
You can ask: ‘Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost?’

00:57:54.740 --> 00:57:59.650
‘Mother is this the all-pervading power
of Divine Love?’

00:57:59.650 --> 00:58:05.150
Otherwise: ‘Mother is this the ruhx, is
this the paramachaitanya?’

00:58:05.150 --> 00:58:12.550
Ask any one of these questions three times
– any one.

00:58:12.550 --> 00:58:18.180
Now put down your hands, please.

00:58:18.180 --> 00:58:19.900
Now put your hands like this towards Me.

00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:21.930
You can wear your glasses also.

00:58:21.930 --> 00:58:26.670
Put your hands like this.

00:58:26.670 --> 00:58:30.190
And don’t think, just don’t think.

00:58:30.190 --> 00:58:33.580
Watch Me, don’t think.

00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:37.820
You can do it.

00:58:37.820 --> 00:58:53.300
All those who have felt the cool breeze in
their hands please raise both your hands.

00:58:53.300 --> 00:58:57.290
Just raise it like that, otherwise I can’t
see.

00:58:57.290 --> 00:58:58.790
It’s very good.

00:58:58.790 --> 00:58:59.790
Imagine.

00:58:59.790 --> 00:59:00.790
Perth.

00:59:00.790 --> 00:59:01.790
I bow to you all.

00:59:01.790 --> 00:59:02.790
Really.

00:59:02.790 --> 00:59:03.790
Bow to you.

00:59:03.790 --> 00:59:05.900
You’ve received your connection.

00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:07.330
No doubt.

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:11.960
I’m getting cool breeze from you.

00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:14.400
And now only thing is you have to grow.

00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:18.370
Some people haven’t got it so we’ll have
to look at them, what’s the problem is.

00:59:18.370 --> 00:59:21.820
May be some problem there.

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:24.170
But most of you have got it.

00:59:24.170 --> 00:59:32.170
Those who have got it or not got it, please
you must come and attend our follow-up places.

00:59:32.170 --> 00:59:40.640
They have got some sort of a program after
this where they will explain to you everything.

00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:48.150
And you will achieve your ultimate goal, is
to know everything about it.

00:59:48.150 --> 00:59:49.270
Everything.

00:59:49.270 --> 00:59:51.530
I promise you, you will get it.

00:59:51.530 --> 00:59:53.240
But give some time to yourself.
