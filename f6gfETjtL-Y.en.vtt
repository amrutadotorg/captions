00:00:03.567 --> 00:00:15.801
Face yourself for becoming.

00:00:15.801 --> 00:00:32.934
Then the preparation is done to become something

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:42.834
and on the whole, when you know that it is
your ego and superego which are loading you up,

00:00:42.834 --> 00:00:53.134
you have to scan them out with vibratory awareness.

00:00:53.134 --> 00:01:06.701
Now there are two types of attention we have to pay.

00:01:06.701 --> 00:01:13.901
First is a constant attention that is a routine of a Sahaja Yogi,

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:22.934
and the second one is the emergency attention.

00:01:22.934 --> 00:01:31.401
I have been saying that all the Sahaja Yogis
must start writing their diaries:

00:01:31.401 --> 00:01:36.501
one with every day’s experiences,

00:01:36.501 --> 00:01:43.167
if you know that you have to write a diary,
you’ll keep your mind alert,

00:01:43.167 --> 00:01:49.734
and another whenever you get any special idea of the past or of the future,

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:50.901
also to jot it down.

00:01:50.901 --> 00:01:54.501
So, like that, you should have two diaries.

00:01:54.501 --> 00:02:01.401
For your constant attention,
you have to fix up your mind on certain things.

00:02:01.401 --> 00:02:06.901
The first one, as I said, that if you keep a diary

00:02:06.901 --> 00:02:13.067
then you will know that you have to remember
what important things have happened.

00:02:13.067 --> 00:02:18.034
So your attention will be alert and
you will be looking out for such points,

00:02:18.034 --> 00:02:21.467
where, what is the thing you see.

00:02:21.467 --> 00:02:24.901
And you’ll be amazed, if you make your attention alert,

00:02:24.901 --> 00:02:29.501
what new things come to you -

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:33.501
very brilliant ideas.

00:02:33.501 --> 00:02:42.034
And the miracles of life and the miracles of God’s beauty and His auspiciousness,

00:02:42.034 --> 00:02:45.501
His greatness, His kindness, His blessings -

00:02:45.501 --> 00:02:51.401
how they work out if you start writing every day even two lines about it.

00:02:51.401 --> 00:02:56.601
It will make your mind constantly involved with it.

00:02:56.601 --> 00:03:01.334
That’s a human style of doing things.

00:03:01.334 --> 00:03:08.501
Also you can mention in the diary

00:03:08.501 --> 00:03:11.501
what happened: did you, could you do your meditation?

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.401
Did you get your time for meditation or not?

00:03:14.401 --> 00:03:21.901
A little bit as if you are appearing
for some sort of an examination or something,

00:03:21.901 --> 00:03:23.601
you prepare a little note like that:

00:03:23.601 --> 00:03:27.801
“Did I get up in the morning? Did I?”

00:03:27.801 --> 00:03:36.401
Then any special path or any special movement

00:03:36.401 --> 00:03:39.467
in the centre or left or right also should be mentioned

00:03:39.467 --> 00:03:42.167
so that you keep a watch on your mind.

00:03:42.167 --> 00:03:46.134
It’s a very good thing to maintain a diary.

00:03:46.134 --> 00:03:51.801
Also, you will see progressively how your ideas are changing,

00:03:51.801 --> 00:03:54.734
how new priorities are settling down,

00:03:54.734 --> 00:03:59.367
how you give more importance to real things

00:03:59.367 --> 00:04:04.667
and very little to unreal things.

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:08.234
I think this is a very, very practical side of human beings

00:04:08.234 --> 00:04:10.901
that one should have a diary.

00:04:10.901 --> 00:04:16.401
Same diaries, after some time, will become historical things

00:04:16.401 --> 00:04:20.467
and people would like to see what you all have written.

00:04:20.467 --> 00:04:26.201
Not to be hypocritical about it or deceptive about it,

00:04:26.201 --> 00:04:30.501
but quite truthful and understanding.

00:04:30.501 --> 00:04:38.667
You should jot down few lines just before sleeping.

00:04:38.667 --> 00:04:47.334
Now we have to see that
we have problems for superego and ego.

00:04:47.334 --> 00:04:51.834
Now superego is the left side, is darkness,

00:04:51.834 --> 00:04:56.801
tamo guna and our past.

00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:01.401
Those who have left side problems should think of the future,

00:05:01.401 --> 00:05:05.401
it gives them balancing if they think of the future.

00:05:05.401 --> 00:05:15.401
For example, a person who is lethargic should take to working.

00:05:15.401 --> 00:05:18.701
Put your mind into working for the future planning:

00:05:18.701 --> 00:05:21.901
what to do, where to go, how to do.

00:05:21.901 --> 00:05:30.167
That will keep you away from drag of the left side

00:05:30.167 --> 00:05:40.401
and gradually then you can balance yourself also.

00:05:40.401 --> 00:05:52.601
Now the right side of a person, when it is activated very much,

00:05:52.601 --> 00:06:01.734
he has to balance it not with the left side but with the centre.

00:06:01.734 --> 00:06:09.567
That is, a person who is very hard-working

00:06:09.567 --> 00:06:14.801
must develop a witness state.

00:06:14.801 --> 00:06:19.801
You try to do a work, any work,

00:06:19.801 --> 00:06:28.000
indulge into work in thoughtless awareness, as a witness.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.067
Whatever work you are doing you just say that:
“I am not doing it."

00:06:35.067 --> 00:06:37.701
This You can do it after Realisation.

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:42.834
You become thoughtlessly aware and start doing your work.

00:06:42.834 --> 00:06:47.801
So the compensation of the left side is done by movement to the right,

00:06:47.801 --> 00:06:50.701
and of the right side [by] movement in the centre.

00:06:50.701 --> 00:06:54.401
Left side is the tamo guna, right side is the rajo guna,

00:06:54.401 --> 00:06:59.701
the centre is the sattwo guna.
But still these are three gunas.

00:06:59.701 --> 00:07:03.301
That’s not the state which we have to achieve.

00:07:03.301 --> 00:07:08.934
About this I’ll tell you tomorrow more,
how to go further then.

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:13.401
After scanning out which side is weak,

00:07:13.401 --> 00:07:17.667
you should plan out your style of life.

00:07:17.667 --> 00:07:22.401
For example, if you are extremely lethargic,
you cannot get up in the morning,

00:07:22.401 --> 00:07:26.701
you feel very sleepy in the night, you do not feel alerted

00:07:26.701 --> 00:07:31.000
then start planning as to what will you do.
How will you get up?

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.801
Even puja is a good idea, homa (havan) is a good idea.

00:07:33.801 --> 00:07:37.601
Do something like that, so that you have to do something,

00:07:37.601 --> 00:07:41.667
what you call the kriya, is the action,
get into the action.

00:07:41.667 --> 00:07:49.734
Some sort of action you go into in Sahaja Yoga as well as in your daily life

00:07:49.734 --> 00:07:54.301
you’ll be able to change that mood and come to the right side

00:07:54.301 --> 00:07:59.501
and then you’ll go to the,
your movement should be towards the sattwa guna,

00:07:59.501 --> 00:08:03.501
is to watch everything.

00:08:03.501 --> 00:08:09.901
Now at the sattwa guna point where you are in the centre

00:08:09.901 --> 00:08:17.501
you have to see how much you are misidentified.

00:08:17.501 --> 00:08:24.034
Say, supposing you are at the first stage of left side,

00:08:24.034 --> 00:08:29.167
then you will just do daydreaming,
“Oh! This person is so much identified,

00:08:29.167 --> 00:08:32.000
that one is so much identified,” as if you are the best.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.301
It’s just human nature, you see.

00:08:34.301 --> 00:08:36.701
“Oh, that person is like that, he is like that,

00:08:36.701 --> 00:08:41.701
this is very bad in the society,
that is going bad in the society. It’s better…”

00:08:41.701 --> 00:08:45.334
Then we can also go to this limit is to,
“That guru is very bad

00:08:45.334 --> 00:08:49.334
and that one is another madcap."
Like that, you see, all daydreaming going on.

00:08:49.334 --> 00:08:51.000
How far it is affecting you,

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.034
how far are you improving by that is not…

00:08:53.034 --> 00:08:58.134
It’s just, you see, thinking, analysing.
It is, it's a lazy stuf,

00:08:58.134 --> 00:09:01.801
sitting down and just analysing, it's a lazy stuff.

00:09:01.801 --> 00:09:04.834
The second thing could be

00:09:04.834 --> 00:09:08.701
when you come to the second side of it, is the kriya.

00:09:08.701 --> 00:09:16.567
Then what happens when you start doing it,
then at least your attention is on what you are doing.

00:09:16.567 --> 00:09:20.801
It’s not allowed to drift into something
and which goes into any nonsense and can,

00:09:20.801 --> 00:09:25.134
I mean, then you don’t know from where the funny thoughts are coming.

00:09:25.134 --> 00:09:26.701
So, you start doing something.

00:09:26.701 --> 00:09:31.801
You can go and plant some trees
or you can go and plant some flowers

00:09:31.801 --> 00:09:34.734
or if you want you can do some cooking, you can do some work.

00:09:34.734 --> 00:09:39.167
Take to work! That will help you. Any work.

00:09:39.167 --> 00:09:44.467
But while doing the work the problem will be, you’ll develop ego.

00:09:44.467 --> 00:09:50.234
That’s why when you are developing the ego you have to tell yourself,

00:09:50.234 --> 00:09:53.367
“You are not doing, mister! This you are not doing,

00:09:53.367 --> 00:09:55.601
this is not doing, you are not doing.”

00:09:55.601 --> 00:09:57.701
If you go on suggesting to yourself,

00:09:57.701 --> 00:09:59.901
Mr. Ego will not come up.

00:09:59.901 --> 00:10:03.401
And then many things, you see,
which normally trouble you and trouble others

00:10:03.401 --> 00:10:06.567
like you have cleaned the room, alright.

00:10:06.567 --> 00:10:10.801
Then somebody comes and spoils it
you get angry with that person.

00:10:10.801 --> 00:10:14.401
Naturally! Because you think ‘you’ have done.

00:10:14.401 --> 00:10:17.834
First of all you don’t clean the room.
If you clean the room then you are prepared,

00:10:17.834 --> 00:10:22.601
it will be dirty, otherwise why should you clean?

00:10:22.601 --> 00:10:25.101
Now, if it is dirty, well and good;

00:10:25.101 --> 00:10:29.401
if it is not dirty, well and good.

00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:34.934
This type of attitude you should take to jump onto sattva guna.

00:10:34.934 --> 00:10:38.301
On sattva guna you start accepting it.

00:10:38.301 --> 00:10:43.701
You become extremely mild.
You become a mild personality.

00:10:43.701 --> 00:10:49.167
Then at that time you do not discuss as to, “Oh, I don’t like it;

00:10:49.167 --> 00:10:51.467
this was wrong; this should not have been."

00:10:51.467 --> 00:10:54.101
All these things do not come to you in sattva guna.

00:10:54.101 --> 00:10:58.067
You start seeing it. That time you see it

00:10:58.067 --> 00:11:01.134
that, “Alright, doesn’t matter.
It’s done, it’s done.”

00:11:01.134 --> 00:11:05.501
On the contrary, you feel hurt if you are a sattwa guni,

00:11:05.501 --> 00:11:12.667
that by any suggestion you have suggested your ego.

00:11:12.667 --> 00:11:15.101
Can you get that point?

00:11:15.101 --> 00:11:19.101
You feel ashamed of your ego,
I mean to say, if you are a sattwa guni.

00:11:19.101 --> 00:11:25.301
For example, even to say that “This is my car,”
you will feel shy. That’s a sattwa guni type.

00:11:25.301 --> 00:11:27.601
Or even to say, “Why did you spoil my carpet?”

00:11:27.601 --> 00:11:30.167
I mean in India nobody will say,
I can tell you this!

00:11:30.167 --> 00:11:33.101
Is regarded [as] bad manners, absolute bad manners.

00:11:33.101 --> 00:11:36.367
If anybody comes to your house and the carpet
is spoiled they say, “Let it be, doesn’t matter."

00:11:36.367 --> 00:11:40.834
Even it is burnt, “I don’t know. Let it be. Are you burnt?”

00:11:40.834 --> 00:11:44.401
They’ll never say that, “You have burnt my carpet,
or done anything to my…”

00:11:44.401 --> 00:11:47.134
Is regarded bad manners.

00:11:47.134 --> 00:11:52.134
Like here, you see, if somebody’s sleeping
somebody makes the noise.

00:11:52.134 --> 00:11:57.167
The person who is sleeping will never say that
“You are making noise,

00:11:57.167 --> 00:12:02.167
He’ll just get up and ask,
“Do you need anything?”

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:04.601
That’s difficult for people here to understand

00:12:04.601 --> 00:12:09.401
because ego is just sitting on the head.
But is bad manners there.

00:12:09.401 --> 00:12:12.501
You will find when you’ll go to India you’ll find this.

00:12:12.501 --> 00:12:18.401
These are bad manners to say that.
Or to say, “Oh, I, I feel very comfortable.

00:12:18.401 --> 00:12:21.201
I mean, to say “I feel comfortable” is bad manners.

00:12:21.201 --> 00:12:24.701
I mean, they never say “I like it.”

00:12:24.701 --> 00:12:28.134
“So what?” All these words are not to be said.

00:12:28.134 --> 00:12:31.401
If you are a sattwa guni then you just don’t say,

00:12:31.401 --> 00:12:38.067
you will say, “Do you like it?
Is it comfortable? Would you like to have this?”

00:12:38.067 --> 00:12:47.067
The whole attention goes from your side.
Do you understand that?

00:12:47.067 --> 00:12:50.901
That is the style one has to develop.
Then you are a sattwa guni.

00:12:50.901 --> 00:12:54.167
Otherwise, you are still on ego trip.
You see, whatever you may think,

00:12:54.167 --> 00:13:00.401
“I don’t like that, I don’t…”
“I”- who are you?

00:13:00.401 --> 00:13:03.501
First of all, ask the question, “Who are you?”

00:13:03.501 --> 00:13:08.801
If God says, “I don’t like you,”
I can understand, with good reasons,

00:13:08.801 --> 00:13:11.134
but for you to say, “I don’t like it” …

00:13:11.134 --> 00:13:16.901
After all, how did you come on this earth?

00:13:16.901 --> 00:13:20.401
How did you get a human birth?

00:13:20.401 --> 00:13:24.801
How did you get all these things?
Now think like that.

00:13:24.801 --> 00:13:30.101
“Who am I?"

00:13:30.101 --> 00:13:33.101
"I am nothing."

00:13:33.101 --> 00:13:37.667
Anybody who thinks, “I am something,”
he should know that he’s nothing;

00:13:37.667 --> 00:13:45.801
makes no difference to God whether he exists or
does not exist, you see, he’s nothing, he’s just a drop.

00:13:45.801 --> 00:13:48.467
So, this point if you understand,

00:13:48.467 --> 00:13:50.067
that even if you do something,

00:13:50.067 --> 00:13:53.134
any work you do or anything you are doing,

00:13:53.134 --> 00:14:01.167
you are just doing it because you want to do it.

00:14:01.167 --> 00:14:04.467
That is how you come on to sattva guna.

00:14:04.467 --> 00:14:07.701
But normally it doesn’t happen.
It happens the other way round.

00:14:07.701 --> 00:14:17.234
For example, a person is, say, doing something

00:14:17.234 --> 00:14:19.534
by any chance he feels hurt

00:14:19.534 --> 00:14:22.134
or he thinks that whatever he has done is no good.

00:14:22.134 --> 00:14:25.367
People don’t appreciate,
or maybe he might think that,

00:14:25.367 --> 00:14:29.667
“Oh, it’s not up to the point,” or whatever it is,

00:14:29.667 --> 00:14:33.934
then the reaction for him is not that
he does not try to rise to sattva guna,

00:14:33.934 --> 00:14:39.367
but he goes back to tamo guna.

00:14:39.367 --> 00:14:44.867
“Alright, I’ll not do it. I’ll sleep over it.
Let them do it, why should I do it?”

00:14:44.867 --> 00:14:52.101
So the training that you have to have
through your rajo guna goes a waste.

00:14:52.101 --> 00:14:56.434
It’s just a training period that you are with rajo guna.

00:14:56.434 --> 00:14:57.934
You are doing something.

00:14:57.934 --> 00:15:05.734
Now in that training period you have to learn
only how to come in the centre.

00:15:05.734 --> 00:15:13.734
For example, now, water is required for you to swim.
If there is no water you cannot swim.

00:15:13.734 --> 00:15:20.834
All right? In the same way, rajo guna is required for you to come to sattwa guni.

00:15:20.834 --> 00:15:26.034
If you do not do any work you cannot come to sattwa guna.

00:15:26.034 --> 00:15:31.534
So you are just working just to train yourself to be a witness.

00:15:31.534 --> 00:15:33.267
Now do you follow that point?

00:15:33.267 --> 00:15:36.301
You are not doing it because you like particular thing,

00:15:36.301 --> 00:15:39.134
you are used to particular thing, because you want to be this.

00:15:39.134 --> 00:15:43.201
This is not the way it is.

00:15:43.201 --> 00:15:48.201
You are just doing it to learn how to be patient.

00:15:48.201 --> 00:15:54.734
To practice your patience.
To see how much patient, you are.

00:15:54.734 --> 00:15:57.967
Once you start doing it, you’ll be amazed

00:15:57.967 --> 00:16:03.334
that you will never feel the burden of the work.

00:16:03.334 --> 00:16:05.734
But it never happens.

00:16:05.734 --> 00:16:13.067
Most of the people, if they find their work is
not effective, they’ll go back to tamo guna.

00:16:13.067 --> 00:16:15.734
There are many attitudes.
Say, somebody’s working,

00:16:15.734 --> 00:16:19.334
then he thinks, “Why should I do all the work?
Others are not doing!”

00:16:19.334 --> 00:16:23.867
He’ll go back to their stage.
But those who are not working will not think that,

00:16:23.867 --> 00:16:27.234
“This person is working, let me also work.”

00:16:27.234 --> 00:16:30.634
It’s other way round, you see.

00:16:30.634 --> 00:16:32.701
This can be an attitude of some people that

00:16:32.701 --> 00:16:38.634
“if this person is working, let him work."

00:16:38.634 --> 00:16:42.967
This is even a meaner stuff, avoid, just.

00:16:42.967 --> 00:16:46.101
You go to a restaurant and
somebody takes out the purse,

00:16:46.101 --> 00:16:49.534
others start looking this side – is very mean,

00:16:49.534 --> 00:16:54.601
it’s a very mean thing to do.
Everybody should come forward

00:16:54.601 --> 00:16:56.901
and once you have paid, you have paid it, finished.

00:16:56.901 --> 00:17:01.134
Then you just don’t start counting,
“Why did I pay?”

00:17:01.134 --> 00:17:05.801
Once you try Or any work has to be done,

00:17:05.801 --> 00:17:09.067
go forward with it, do it with your heart.

00:17:09.067 --> 00:17:12.467
Don’t worry if others have not done it.

00:17:12.467 --> 00:17:16.067
Just do it for its pleasure and
the pleasure only you will get

00:17:16.067 --> 00:17:20.367
when you will do it with the understanding that it’s a training period,

00:17:20.367 --> 00:17:25.000
you are better trained than the other one is.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.567
You are at a higher class than the other one is.

00:17:27.567 --> 00:17:32.701
So we have to be at a higher class.

00:17:32.701 --> 00:17:36.101
For that this is just a training on.

00:17:36.101 --> 00:17:43.534
And that’s how we can really put our preparation into practice, into all details

00:17:43.534 --> 00:17:48.734
to see how we work out our ego and superego.

00:17:48.734 --> 00:17:57.000
Today, in the morning, I have told you that your intellect must imbibe this within itself, all right?

00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:05.401
And now I’m telling you that your action,
action that you do,

00:18:05.401 --> 00:18:20.234
must be every time branded by you
as just your training – any action you do.

00:18:20.234 --> 00:18:23.601
Supposing you have to drive for miles together,

00:18:23.601 --> 00:18:25.401
you are trying your patience.

00:18:25.401 --> 00:18:29.901
You see they’ll do in everything.
Say they have to go for say helicopter,

00:18:29.901 --> 00:18:35.067
or say if they have to drop from the…
what you call them, they drop down?

00:18:35.067 --> 00:18:36.634
Sahaja Yogis: Parachutes.

00:18:36.634 --> 00:18:37.234
Ha?

00:18:37.234 --> 00:18:39.167
Shri Mataji: Parachuters!

00:18:39.167 --> 00:18:42.567
Or helicopter you take away or whatever it is.

00:18:42.567 --> 00:18:47.234
You go on doing it again and again, isn’t it?
You practice it again and again.

00:18:47.234 --> 00:18:50.134
You drop many-a-times, you break your legs, you break your hands,

00:18:50.134 --> 00:18:56.701
you do this and do that till you become a master.
You understand My point?

00:18:56.701 --> 00:18:59.867
Driving – same way, till you become a master, you go on.

00:18:59.867 --> 00:19:05.667
In the same way, you are doing this work
just to master your patience.

00:19:05.667 --> 00:19:13.034
And then your love, is your love –
how much you love really.

00:19:13.034 --> 00:19:20.867
If you really love someone,
you are never tired of working.

00:19:20.867 --> 00:19:23.701
You are never upset with work.

00:19:23.701 --> 00:19:26.701
But if you don’t love, you start counting,

00:19:26.701 --> 00:19:32.767
“How much money, how much work,
how many hours, how much to be paid?”

00:19:32.767 --> 00:19:38.901
All artificiality comes because
there is no love involved in your work.

00:19:38.901 --> 00:19:45.334
Whatever you don’t want to do, you don’t do it, to begin with.

00:19:45.334 --> 00:19:51.367
To begin with you just don’t do
what you don’t like – to begin with.

00:19:51.367 --> 00:19:53.734
But once you have mastered that,

00:19:53.734 --> 00:19:59.334
then you have to master it that
you do something that you don’t like.

00:19:59.334 --> 00:20:02.334
Like meeting some bhooties, for example.

00:20:02.334 --> 00:20:05.767
You don’t want to meet, you want to run away,

00:20:05.767 --> 00:20:09.067
but you go little nearer it, you see.

00:20:09.067 --> 00:20:11.667
Then develop a immunity for these bhooties.

00:20:11.667 --> 00:20:16.067
After some time you’ll not catch them.

00:20:16.067 --> 00:20:18.801
We have to develop the immunity, isn’t it?

00:20:18.801 --> 00:20:24.701
Otherwise one person comes here and everybody’s head goes out.

00:20:24.701 --> 00:20:28.867
Instead of the fellow improving, you all go out.

00:20:28.867 --> 00:20:36.767
So all these things are, all these events
are for your training, your immunity.

00:20:36.767 --> 00:20:41.367
Your immunity is to be trained

00:20:41.367 --> 00:20:43.901
and when it is so, when we are training ourselves

00:20:43.901 --> 00:20:48.801
we should take it as a job.

00:20:48.801 --> 00:20:54.901
But the attitude should be extremely positive,

00:20:54.901 --> 00:20:58.067
extremely positive

00:20:58.067 --> 00:21:03.734
and all that should be expressed in your notebook:

00:21:03.734 --> 00:21:08.601
whether you got dejected or you got upset and disgusted,

00:21:08.601 --> 00:21:12.867
you want to run away from it – all sorts of things.

00:21:12.867 --> 00:21:19.167
It’s just a training to your mind.

00:21:19.167 --> 00:21:24.134
Whatever is the situation, wherever one has to live,

00:21:24.134 --> 00:21:30.567
whatever one has to do, we should do.

00:21:30.567 --> 00:21:35.334
Whatever may be the circumstances, conditions,

00:21:35.334 --> 00:21:38.567
you’ll be amazed, you will not even know
what you have eaten in the morning,

00:21:38.567 --> 00:21:43.767
what you have eaten in the evening,
whether you have eaten or not you will not know.

00:21:43.767 --> 00:21:47.167
You’ll not fuss about it,

00:21:47.167 --> 00:21:53.067
you’ll not worry about it, you’ll not think about it.

00:21:53.067 --> 00:22:01.367
But this being, the aim, is to reach to sattwa guna,

00:22:01.367 --> 00:22:07.067
every other thing becomes zero.

00:22:07.067 --> 00:22:10.601
It’s the greatest hurdle comes to Sahaja Yogis I’ve seen,

00:22:10.601 --> 00:22:14.434
when they start organising.

00:22:14.434 --> 00:22:19.034
They start organising something.
Now somebody wants something,

00:22:19.034 --> 00:22:23.034
so they’ll run up to get the thing for that person.

00:22:23.034 --> 00:22:27.000
Now just now I’ve said that you must look after the needs of others,

00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:33.000
but if I am sitting here and there’s a lecture on
then you’d better be just listening to Me.

00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.034
You see, this also is there that:
how to have your priorities,

00:22:37.034 --> 00:22:42.167
at this time when something working on you.

00:22:42.167 --> 00:22:45.000
This is the first thing you have to do.

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:50.334
Not that at this time you go and cook.

00:22:50.334 --> 00:22:56.901
You have known the story of two sisters
attending on Christ. Alright?

00:22:56.901 --> 00:23:02.667
So at this time, what is your first job

00:23:02.667 --> 00:23:07.101
is to try to be more exposed to Me

00:23:07.101 --> 00:23:10.334
so that automatically you’ll go into your sattwa guna.

00:23:10.334 --> 00:23:13.234
This is the best!

00:23:13.234 --> 00:23:20.767
But if I am not there and when you are alone or when you are with other Sahaja Yogis

00:23:20.767 --> 00:23:25.767
you must now compete in rising higher and higher:

00:23:25.767 --> 00:23:30.434
from tamo guna to rajo guna and
from rajo guna to sattwo guna.

00:23:30.434 --> 00:23:35.734
But actually by Realisation
you have gone beyond these three gunas.

00:23:35.734 --> 00:23:42.501
You have gone beyond it.
Actually that is what has happened to you.

00:23:42.501 --> 00:23:48.634
But, like clouds, they cover you again and again.

00:23:48.634 --> 00:23:53.034
And when the sky is covered with those clouds,

00:23:53.034 --> 00:23:59.167
you cannot see the sun, you cannot see the moon,
you cannot see the stars.

00:23:59.167 --> 00:24:02.867
So we have to know how these clouds are coming into us

00:24:02.867 --> 00:24:06.734
and that’s how we go into our complete analysis.

00:24:06.734 --> 00:24:09.401
How these clouds are coming to us,

00:24:09.401 --> 00:24:13.701
you find out about our different chakras.

00:24:13.701 --> 00:24:17.967
What are the chakras we are catching?

00:24:17.967 --> 00:24:24.634
Here comes the another constant attention towards our chakras.

00:24:24.634 --> 00:24:30.801
Are our vibrations alright or not?
Are we getting our vibrations?

00:24:30.801 --> 00:24:35.734
If not, what chakra am I catching,
what must be the catch?

00:24:35.734 --> 00:24:40.367
I must raise my Kundalini, see for myself,
where is the catch.

00:24:40.367 --> 00:24:42.534
Do I do my meditation or not?

00:24:42.534 --> 00:24:47.634
If I do it, am I doing it just dozingly or am I really in it?

00:24:47.634 --> 00:24:52.501
Am I really feeling it or not? Am I alert or not?

00:24:52.501 --> 00:25:01.034
All this is to be assiduously, sincerely, absolutely, truthfully should be worked out.

00:25:01.034 --> 00:25:06.334
Because it is a process between your self

00:25:06.334 --> 00:25:08.834
"Atamanyeva Atmana tushta"
[The Spirit is satisfied with Itself].

00:25:08.834 --> 00:25:13.334
You see it’s a very funny, it is so funny relationship

00:25:13.334 --> 00:25:21.034
that it is the Atma is satisfied with Atma!

00:25:21.034 --> 00:25:24.767
You have to be satisfied with your Self.

00:25:24.767 --> 00:25:27.267
There’s nobody, Mataji is not concerned,
nobody is concerned.

00:25:27.267 --> 00:25:32.601
It is you who is concerned with your Self.

00:25:32.601 --> 00:25:38.601
For example, you ask somebody and he says,
“I am like this, Mother."

00:25:38.601 --> 00:25:41.334
Now think that you are Mother,

00:25:41.334 --> 00:25:51.101
one personality, another is, say, Mr. Don or Kingsley or someone X. You are two personalities.

00:25:51.101 --> 00:25:57.634
So when you are telling your Self,
means that is Mataji, that, “I am not alright,”

00:25:57.634 --> 00:26:00.701
then Mataji must come up and say,
“What do you mean by this?

00:26:00.701 --> 00:26:08.167
Why should you say like that? What’s wrong?”

00:26:08.167 --> 00:26:17.267
When you say that to yourself which is outside,

00:26:17.267 --> 00:26:26.834
then the attention starts moving towards your Self which is Mataji and you start becoming that

00:26:26.834 --> 00:26:30.501
and you start seeing through your Atma.

00:26:30.501 --> 00:26:35.767
So your Atma is to be satisfied by your Atma only.

00:26:35.767 --> 00:26:37.501
There is nothing in between.

00:26:37.501 --> 00:26:42.601
It is you only in this dual personality
has to satisfy your Self.

00:26:42.601 --> 00:26:46.534
One is in ignorance, one is in knowledge.

00:26:46.534 --> 00:26:51.167
Now try to identify yourself with that Mataji, call it,

00:26:51.167 --> 00:26:58.967
or any Xyz whatever you call it, Atma.
And just for, just a drama, say.

00:26:58.967 --> 00:27:03.601
You just think that you are the Self, Spirit.

00:27:03.601 --> 00:27:08.201
So how will you address your Self? Let’s see.

00:27:08.201 --> 00:27:09.834
Supposing you have to sit in My seat,

00:27:09.834 --> 00:27:12.234
yes, take it like that, a position.

00:27:12.234 --> 00:27:16.301
And then you are sitting in front of Me also, alright?

00:27:16.301 --> 00:27:19.734
So you are sitting here and sitting there.
Take a position like that.

00:27:19.734 --> 00:27:22.734
Now you put up your Self in a drama
and you start addressing yourself,

00:27:22.734 --> 00:27:26.534
“So Bala, how are you?”

00:27:26.534 --> 00:27:33.367
so Bala says, “Better,”

00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:38.934
So if you are identified now with Mataji,

00:27:38.934 --> 00:27:42.634
gradually Bala will diminish, alright?

00:27:42.634 --> 00:27:46.334
But if you are still identified with Bala,

00:27:46.334 --> 00:27:50.301
he’ll grow and this will diminish.

00:27:50.301 --> 00:28:00.501
You have to try to address yourself as if you are Mataji.

00:28:00.501 --> 00:28:07.401
It’s a drama.
You sit before the mirror.

00:28:07.401 --> 00:28:10.767
In the mirror you see this outside of yours

00:28:10.767 --> 00:28:15.367
and here you are sitting, whatever you are, Mr. Don for example.

00:28:15.367 --> 00:28:18.967
Now Mr. Don is addressing the other Don there,

00:28:18.967 --> 00:28:22.501
and let him take up a role that, “I am the Spirit.”

00:28:22.501 --> 00:28:27.967
He’ll say, “I am the Spirit and I am eternal.
I am this.

00:28:27.967 --> 00:28:31.734
Nobody can destroy me.
I am above everything."

00:28:31.734 --> 00:28:36.134
That thing will go down.

00:28:36.134 --> 00:28:38.934
“I am a realised soul.
I know what Spirit is.

00:28:38.934 --> 00:28:46.301
What are you talking?” It will go down.

00:28:46.301 --> 00:28:51.867
This is how you start moving.

00:28:51.867 --> 00:28:56.967
But it is only possible that first you become a sattwa guni.

00:28:56.967 --> 00:29:01.101
If you are not a sattwa guni, with ego, “I am this,”

00:29:01.101 --> 00:29:05.534
then you become a guru and you start minting money!

00:29:05.534 --> 00:29:08.234
First the ego is to be brought down.

00:29:08.234 --> 00:29:14.167
If there is still ego, then without becoming Atma you become an ego.

00:29:14.167 --> 00:29:18.934
So first this journey should be brought in to the centre of sattwa guna.

00:29:18.934 --> 00:29:25.767
That is why I say that when you are talking or doing anything,

00:29:25.767 --> 00:29:32.834
you must know that it is your Spirit which is doing it.

00:29:32.834 --> 00:29:38.867
That’s how you put your Spirit in charge

00:29:38.867 --> 00:29:43.534
or say at the pedestal – first stage.

00:29:43.534 --> 00:29:47.467
Then when the Spirit is there, then from this stage to that stage,

00:29:47.467 --> 00:29:52.401
then you say that, “Now I am the Spirit."

00:29:52.401 --> 00:29:59.534
For example, if you have a prime minister and a deputy minister and a minister – three persons, alright?

00:29:59.534 --> 00:30:06.101
Now, if the prime minister is your Self

00:30:06.101 --> 00:30:09.667
and the minister has to become the prime minister,

00:30:09.667 --> 00:30:13.667
so he has to first become deputy minister.

00:30:13.667 --> 00:30:18.067
After becoming deputy minister he has to become prime minister;

00:30:18.067 --> 00:30:21.067
but deputy prime minister and then the prime minister.

00:30:21.067 --> 00:30:24.434
But supposing this fellow starts to jump over this,

00:30:24.434 --> 00:30:25.901
this will come up and hit him and he’ll say,

00:30:25.901 --> 00:30:31.067
“I’m the one!”
and this one is E-G-O.

00:30:31.067 --> 00:30:34.901
Do you understand My point?

00:30:34.901 --> 00:30:38.667
So you cannot surpass it.

00:30:38.667 --> 00:30:43.167
You have to merge this into this and then this into this.

00:30:43.167 --> 00:30:45.167
The movement has to be like that.

00:30:45.167 --> 00:30:50.801
But if you try to just become this, actually you will become this, not this,

00:30:50.801 --> 00:30:53.701
because you cannot become this.

00:30:53.701 --> 00:30:57.367
Do you understand My point?

00:30:57.367 --> 00:31:03.067
So, even when doing this exercise of sitting before a mirror

00:31:03.067 --> 00:31:08.267
and telling yourself that you are the Spirit,

00:31:08.267 --> 00:31:20.134
you are the part of Viraat, that you are the Ocean

00:31:20.134 --> 00:31:24.667
because your drop has fallen into the Ocean.

00:31:24.667 --> 00:31:29.267
Then you must know that your drop has fallen into the Ocean.

00:31:29.267 --> 00:31:33.201
That’s why you’ve become an Ocean.
If that stage is missing,

00:31:33.201 --> 00:31:39.534
then you’re saying that you are an Ocean is absolutely bombastic.

00:31:39.534 --> 00:31:43.934
And that is why one has to be very steady and careful,

00:31:43.934 --> 00:31:47.767
absolutely steady as far as dealing with oneself.

00:31:47.767 --> 00:31:51.334
Because you know how this intelligence can cheat you.

00:31:51.334 --> 00:31:56.467
So be very, very careful and when you are dealing with you,

00:31:56.467 --> 00:32:01.434
you must know that you have to first overcome this ego.

00:32:01.434 --> 00:32:03.567
The best thing to overcome ego

00:32:03.567 --> 00:32:06.101
is to change your language style,

00:32:06.101 --> 00:32:10.667
is to speak in the third person.
Is a very good way.

00:32:10.667 --> 00:32:13.667
Like you must say, when you are talking about yourself,

00:32:13.667 --> 00:32:20.101
“This Mataji won’t listen to Me.
This Mataji won’t do this,”

00:32:20.101 --> 00:32:25.467
you see, so what happens, this ‘Mataji’ means the ego part of it, you see.

00:32:25.467 --> 00:32:29.767
And once you start separating this Mataji away from yourself,

00:32:29.767 --> 00:32:33.667
then that ego Mataji disappears.
You understand?

00:32:33.667 --> 00:32:38.767
Like you can say, "This Bala is like that.
He won’t listen."

00:32:38.767 --> 00:32:43.834
So whatever the real Bala is left in you is alright.

00:32:43.834 --> 00:32:47.000
That’s how you get rid of your ego

00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.801
and by understanding your centres,
what you are catching, where you are catching,

00:32:51.801 --> 00:32:54.801
how you are catching;

00:32:54.801 --> 00:33:01.534
it would be very easy for you to get rid of your problems.

00:33:01.534 --> 00:33:04.534
Now, see what Sahaja Yogis do.

00:33:04.534 --> 00:33:06.867
Supposing there are five Sahaja Yogis sitting.

00:33:06.867 --> 00:33:09.767
I mean you know that I know about everyone, everything.

00:33:09.767 --> 00:33:14.201
I don’t have to ask, “Where is catching?”

00:33:14.201 --> 00:33:19.267
Now why do I ask? I show complete ignorance.

00:33:19.267 --> 00:33:22.467
Because perhaps I never catch also, to be very frank.

00:33:22.467 --> 00:33:27.367
But if I want to know where I’m catching
I can find out but I don’t want to.

00:33:27.367 --> 00:33:31.867
So what I say, “Alright, Chaya, tell Me where is he catching."

00:33:31.867 --> 00:33:35.234
At this time one attitude could be that,

00:33:35.234 --> 00:33:41.834
“I must tell, otherwise Mataji won’t know.”
This is very funny.

00:33:41.834 --> 00:33:48.767
The second one could be,
and the second one could be that,

00:33:48.767 --> 00:33:58.267
that, “I know where she is catching and, and I must tell,

00:33:58.267 --> 00:34:06.267
and Mataji also knows but She wants to test me.
So I should be careful."

00:34:06.267 --> 00:34:08.967
At this point people make mistakes.

00:34:08.967 --> 00:34:13.967
If I ask them, “Where is it catching?”

00:34:13.967 --> 00:34:26.501
“I am catching on left heart but very mildly!”
Finished then! You, you’ll get less marks.

00:34:26.501 --> 00:34:30.067
You get less marks.
You tell Me whatever you think,

00:34:30.067 --> 00:34:36.334
because at least you’re honest.
Whatever you think.

00:34:36.334 --> 00:34:39.167
Supposing the fellow is not catching heart

00:34:39.167 --> 00:34:43.667
but you are feeling the heart.
You say, “Heart” That’s being honest.

00:34:43.667 --> 00:34:46.667
Then I will tell you who is catching the heart.

00:34:46.667 --> 00:34:52.634
But if you are, “Perhaps yes, Mataji. No, Mataji,”

00:34:52.634 --> 00:34:58.201
then you get less marks.
It’s not a very good answer.

00:34:58.201 --> 00:35:01.967
“I am not alright, I don’t know,” that’s not a good answer.

00:35:01.967 --> 00:35:06.934
You have to tell Me who is catching where.

00:35:06.934 --> 00:35:11.134
Then you pay more attention that you have to pass this test.

00:35:11.134 --> 00:35:14.401
This is just testing. Why?

00:35:14.401 --> 00:35:17.167
Because tomorrow you have to give Realisation.

00:35:17.167 --> 00:35:22.667
You have to become the gurus.
You have to know all this.

00:35:22.667 --> 00:35:25.767
So this is all training period.

00:35:25.767 --> 00:35:29.567
I’m just training you by asking you to tell Me,

00:35:29.567 --> 00:35:34.167
but I have seen people even getting ego with this.
It’s surprisingly sometimes.

00:35:34.167 --> 00:35:39.401
That also gives the ego to people that I say,
“Alright, you tell Me where he is catching?”

00:35:39.401 --> 00:35:43.867
“I told correctly!” Finished!

00:35:43.867 --> 00:35:51.334
You see, it is just a very, very, I can say, razor stage I tell you,

00:35:51.334 --> 00:35:55.967
where one has to see clearly.
So be a simple person like children are.

00:35:55.967 --> 00:36:00.234
They just come.
This one, that one, finished.

00:36:00.234 --> 00:36:04.101
Then they’ll go and sit down,
“Now I’m tired, I’m sitting down!”

00:36:04.101 --> 00:36:08.534
They are not bothered that they should…

00:36:08.534 --> 00:36:12.467
they must say something or something show off, nothing.

00:36:12.467 --> 00:36:16.967
Whatever they see, they say.

00:36:16.967 --> 00:36:18.601
But only grownups will say that,

00:36:18.601 --> 00:36:22.767
“Maybe I’m catching, maybe it is his.
I don’t know.”

00:36:22.767 --> 00:36:25.734
All this is done by grownup people

00:36:25.734 --> 00:36:33.401
because still the sensitivity is alright but they are not sure of themselves.

00:36:33.401 --> 00:36:37.467
Children are very sure.
They are cocksure of everything.

00:36:37.467 --> 00:36:40.534
You ask them anything, they’ll tell you,
“Yes, this is this, this is this.”

00:36:40.534 --> 00:36:45.567
ولی شما از هر کسی بپرسید:
"این چه رنگی است؟"

00:36:45.567 --> 00:36:51.901
They’ll say, “Maybe green, maybe red.”

00:36:51.901 --> 00:36:57.000
Like we had one old gentleman, not very old, as old as Myself

00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:02.767
but he was to come to My house and he telephoned to Me.

00:37:02.767 --> 00:37:05.201
He said, “I want to come to Your house
so how should I come?”

00:37:05.201 --> 00:37:08.067
I said, “This place is Oxted, you can come there but

00:37:08.067 --> 00:37:11.567
if you don’t get a taxi then it’s very difficult, better come to Hurst Green."

00:37:11.567 --> 00:37:14.967
He said, “Where?”
I said, “Hurst Green.”

00:37:14.967 --> 00:37:20.167
So he said, “Hurst Blue?”
How he is saying blue to green, I don’t know.

00:37:20.167 --> 00:37:23.167
I said, “No, it’s Hurst Green.”

00:37:23.167 --> 00:37:29.367
He said, “What did you say?”
I said, “Hurst Green.”

00:37:29.367 --> 00:37:33.334
So he couldn’t understand.
“What is the second one?”

00:37:33.334 --> 00:37:52.767
I said, “What is the colour of the leaves?” He said, “Blue.”

00:37:52.767 --> 00:37:56.567
I said it to Gregoire, I said, “Now listen to him, what is he saying?

00:37:56.567 --> 00:38:00.434
Colour of the leaves is blue?”

00:38:00.434 --> 00:38:10.167
So, Gregoire lifted the phone he said,
“Alright, you come to Hurst Blue.”

00:38:10.167 --> 00:38:12.901
So he said, “Now at least…”
I said, “What are you telling?”

00:38:12.901 --> 00:38:17.067
He said, “Now he won’t come, Mother.
That botheration is gone.

00:38:17.067 --> 00:38:21.134
Such a confused personality, mixing between blue and green!

00:38:21.134 --> 00:38:27.101
You are fighting. That’s what it is.
The attention drifts.

00:38:27.101 --> 00:38:30.234
So try to see that if you are confused, there is confusion,

00:38:30.234 --> 00:38:34.334
clear it out by clearing out your chakras.

00:38:34.334 --> 00:38:36.267
Now every chakra,

00:38:36.267 --> 00:38:40.401
let’s have a little testing of it alright, let’s see?

00:38:40.401 --> 00:38:45.401
One by one. So who are going to answer
the questions? Let’s see.

00:38:45.401 --> 00:38:51.767
Simple questions. Not ‘Mastermind’
Very simple questions.

00:38:51.767 --> 00:38:56.634
Now, say your Hamsa Chakra is catching,
what should we do?

00:38:56.634 --> 00:39:01.567
Who will answer the question?

00:39:01.567 --> 00:39:06.534
Hamsa Chakra is catching, what should we do?
Let’s see, one by one.

00:39:06.534 --> 00:39:10.401
Sahaja Yogi: Hamsa, Hamsa.

00:39:10.401 --> 00:39:13.467
That’s the name of the chakra.

00:39:13.467 --> 00:39:16.967
Sahaja Yogi: Someone said to me that you say Hamsa.

00:39:16.967 --> 00:39:22.101
No…you see this is the Hamsa Chakra so you have to say that,

00:39:22.101 --> 00:39:31.134
“Twameva sakshat, Hamsa Chakra Swamini sakshat, Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi namoh, namah.”

00:39:31.134 --> 00:39:37.801
See, opened now?

00:39:37.801 --> 00:39:39.601
Now say it, all of you,

00:39:39.601 --> 00:39:43.701
because just now you are catching.
Now put your finger like this and now say it.

00:40:02.434 --> 00:40:04.501
Say it again. Say it thrice.

00:40:23.734 --> 00:40:24.667
Now Say it.

00:40:44.334 --> 00:40:50.467
See? Better.

00:40:50.467 --> 00:40:56.234
Now, what happens in this centre
that both the Nadis, Ha and Tha,

00:40:56.234 --> 00:41:01.634
Ida and Pingala, they come and meet and they cross over.

00:41:01.634 --> 00:41:09.334
So, for the right Nadi, right side, this one,
the left Nadi flows

00:41:09.334 --> 00:41:17.067
and from the right side, the one
which comes from the right side flows into left side.

00:41:17.067 --> 00:41:21.934
These two centres meet here,
I mean two Nadis meet here actually,

00:41:21.934 --> 00:41:26.634
below the Agnya, it’s below the Agnya at Hamsa, you see,

00:41:26.634 --> 00:41:32.234
and the problems come to you
either from the right or from the left.

00:41:32.234 --> 00:41:35.534
Most of you catch on Hamsa here,

00:41:35.534 --> 00:41:38.834
because of cold or whatever it is.

00:41:38.834 --> 00:41:42.134
Now, I have told you many things by which you control your cold.

00:41:42.134 --> 00:41:48.901
But if it is due to the left side, left side catching is there,

00:41:48.901 --> 00:42:02.501
then for left side Hamsa what should you do? Tell Me.

00:42:02.501 --> 00:42:12.101
Sahaja Yogi: Keep your eyes on the ground, on the green.

00:42:12.101 --> 00:42:15.000
That’s one of them, but another thing,

00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.501
I mean as far as mantra is concerned what mantra will you say…

00:42:18.501 --> 00:42:22.401
Sahaja Yogi: Ekadasha Rudra.

00:42:22.401 --> 00:42:27.101
No that’s much higher, that’s even above the Agnya.

00:42:27.101 --> 00:42:29.334
Sahaja Yogi: Mahakali.

00:42:29.334 --> 00:42:30.667
Mahakali, correct.

00:42:30.667 --> 00:42:33.901
But you can say Ida, Ida Nadi.
Now see just now I have told you

00:42:33.901 --> 00:42:41.134
that it is the Ida Nadi which comes
from the left and goes to the right side.

00:42:41.134 --> 00:42:46.767
So, you have to say Mahakali or Ida Nadi,
Ida Nadi Swamini.

00:42:46.767 --> 00:42:50.901
Now say it.
Just now you are catching on the left.

00:43:10.701 --> 00:43:11.534
Again.

00:43:30.567 --> 00:43:31.434
Again.

00:43:52.501 --> 00:43:57.434
Now, then another thing, that supposing your right side is catching,

00:43:57.434 --> 00:44:01.501
or you have a liver problem, then what should be used

00:44:01.501 --> 00:44:12.467
light, sun’s rays or water?

00:44:12.467 --> 00:44:15.567
Sahaja Yogi: Water.

00:44:15.567 --> 00:44:21.267
See, right side is heat, is Surya Nadi.

00:44:21.267 --> 00:44:26.634
So you have problem of Surya Nadi – right side.

00:44:26.634 --> 00:44:31.534
So to neutralize it you have to use something else.

00:44:31.534 --> 00:44:37.667
So then that time what you have to say, is to

00:44:37.667 --> 00:44:46.801
you can say, you can take the name of Chandra,

00:44:46.801 --> 00:44:49.767
you’ll cool down.

00:44:49.767 --> 00:44:54.201
If there is heat on the right hand side,
you should take the name of Chandra.

00:44:54.201 --> 00:44:59.401
If it is the left side catching,
then you have to take the name of Surya.

00:44:59.401 --> 00:45:03.134
For example, you are possessed,
then go and sit in the Sun

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.567
all the bhoots will run away.
They run away from the Sun.

00:45:06.567 --> 00:45:12.767
But supposing you are an egotistical person then go and sit in the moonlight.

00:45:12.767 --> 00:45:19.867
Maybe you’ll be a little lunatic.

00:45:19.867 --> 00:45:22.000
It comes from the word ‘luna’, you see?

00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.734
But if you are a crying type and all the time over-romantic

00:45:25.734 --> 00:45:33.801
better not look at the moon and better see the sun.
See the compensations.

00:45:33.801 --> 00:45:36.467
This is absolutely understanding that many people,

00:45:36.467 --> 00:45:39.367
if they have liver they put in this.

00:45:39.367 --> 00:45:43.734
What can the fire do now? There’s already fire here.

00:45:43.734 --> 00:45:46.967
Adding fire to the fire again, you see?

00:45:46.967 --> 00:45:56.234
But, also, what one can do is to take out this fire
and give it to this one.

00:45:56.234 --> 00:46:02.167
Now, how do you do that?

00:46:02.167 --> 00:46:04.667
Sahaja Yogi: Lemon?

00:46:04.667 --> 00:46:12.000
No, no. to fire. Supposing I want to treat
My liver with fire. How do I do it?

00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:18.467
Sahaja Yogi: You put your finger actually to the flame so that it burns off.

00:46:18.467 --> 00:46:20.201
No.

00:46:20.201 --> 00:46:23.234
Sahaja Yogi: It'll take too much a week!

00:46:23.234 --> 00:46:26.434
Yes, that’s correct but something takes sometimes about it.

00:46:26.434 --> 00:46:29.401
Think it over then, think it over, take it over.

00:46:29.401 --> 00:46:31.967
You see, you have to take out your heat

00:46:31.967 --> 00:46:35.534
and give it to these lights.

00:46:35.534 --> 00:46:43.101
How do you do it? Think it over.

00:46:43.101 --> 00:46:46.767
I’ll tell you the simple thing is: this left hand is minus,

00:46:46.767 --> 00:46:49.000
this is plus, you can take like that, alright?

00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:51.301
So whatever you do with your left hand you suck in.

00:46:51.301 --> 00:46:56.801
Whatever you do with your right hand, say, for example, you give out. Alright?

00:46:56.801 --> 00:47:01.367
So now if you want to give out now, what you do

00:47:01.367 --> 00:47:03.401
is to put your left hand on you here

00:47:03.401 --> 00:47:07.167
and right hand outside.

00:47:07.167 --> 00:47:11.567
So this is cooling it here actually and the heat is going there.

00:47:11.567 --> 00:47:17.467
But if you do the other way round, you are sucking heat.

00:47:17.467 --> 00:47:22.734
But if you do the other way round, you are sucking heat.

00:47:22.734 --> 00:47:27.167
Just electrons, alright, then?

00:47:27.167 --> 00:47:33.734
Now if you burn here is a good idea,
very good idea for Left Nabhi.

00:47:33.734 --> 00:47:38.867
So the Left Nabhi gets heated up.
This side needs heat.

00:47:38.867 --> 00:47:43.667
This side needs cooling.
This is the basics.

00:47:43.667 --> 00:47:47.901
If something is wrong with this side,
you have to give it the cool.

00:47:47.901 --> 00:47:53.901
If something is wrong on this side, you have to give it the heat.

00:47:53.901 --> 00:47:56.667
Some people get too much cool vibrations.

00:47:56.667 --> 00:48:01.067
They’ll perspire and cool, means left is finished.

00:48:01.067 --> 00:48:07.534
Now what should they do as far as fire is concerned? Let’s see.

00:48:07.534 --> 00:48:11.101
Sahaj Yogi: right hand here

00:48:11.101 --> 00:48:13.901
He perspires.
Right hand on the heart, left hand here.

00:48:13.901 --> 00:48:17.267
If anyone perspires, it means his heart is weak.

00:48:17.267 --> 00:48:27.167
So put your right hand here at the time on the heart.
The heat comes in.

00:48:27.167 --> 00:48:33.167
Are you following the electronics, no, the electrical?
Sahaja Yogi: Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:48:33.167 --> 00:48:36.567
So the basics if you know that the left side is the cool side,

00:48:36.567 --> 00:48:40.234
the right side is the hot side.
And about the hands,

00:48:40.234 --> 00:48:42.000
this is the minus side,

00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.367
this is the plus side.

00:48:44.367 --> 00:48:48.334
Even if you can do like this and you are balancing yourself.

00:48:48.334 --> 00:48:52.134
Just like in India we do,

00:48:52.134 --> 00:48:58.701
especially if you see a great bhootish
then you’ll do like this, fully.

00:48:58.701 --> 00:49:05.667
You see?
So, these two sides are: one is the hot side,

00:49:05.667 --> 00:49:08.701
one is a cold side,

00:49:08.701 --> 00:49:19.267
while the Sattva Guna is the meeting point, is lukewarm.

00:49:19.267 --> 00:49:25.334
The Sattva Guna gives you the temperature that you have.

00:49:25.334 --> 00:49:29.201
Alright? And these two give you either
very cold or very hot.

00:49:29.201 --> 00:49:39.101
So we come back to now sinus again.
It is which side problem?

00:49:39.101 --> 00:49:40.967
Sahaja Yogis: Left hand side.

00:49:40.967 --> 00:49:42.901
Correct! Left side,

00:49:42.901 --> 00:49:46.501
because there are three things now in our bodies.

00:49:46.501 --> 00:49:51.901
One is…what do you say to that? Bulgam.

00:49:51.901 --> 00:50:03.801
Another is the bile and the third one is the gas or Vayu.
Alright?

00:50:03.801 --> 00:50:06.967
So the left side is the Kapha.

00:50:06.967 --> 00:50:12.734
All these colds and things are due to the left side.

00:50:12.734 --> 00:50:17.167
And the right side is the bile.

00:50:17.167 --> 00:50:28.201
The fat is created from bulgam,
which doctors do not know. Do you know that?

00:50:28.201 --> 00:50:36.601
When fat is heated up by the right hand side, then it dissolves

00:50:36.601 --> 00:50:40.967
and the gas movement is in the centre.

00:50:40.967 --> 00:50:49.401
When these five types of gases which are within us, when they all combine together

00:50:49.401 --> 00:50:56.634
and get enlightened by the Spirit,
you get the Cool Breeze coming out.

00:50:56.634 --> 00:51:04.201
So the centre path is the prana.

00:51:04.201 --> 00:51:13.734
When it gets absolutely heated up

00:51:13.734 --> 00:51:28.301
then diseases like tuberculosis, all these things can come in.

00:51:28.301 --> 00:51:38.067
And when it gets heated up on the left hand side you get tuberculosis and all these things due to too much heat.

00:51:38.067 --> 00:51:41.401
When it gets heated too much, then it comes to the right hand side

00:51:41.401 --> 00:51:44.234
and you get diseases like liver

00:51:44.234 --> 00:51:48.234
and all these heatening things on the right hand side.

00:51:48.234 --> 00:51:53.201
So though the left hand side is cold,

00:51:53.201 --> 00:52:02.000
if it is heated up then also diseases are caused.

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:06.567
Now we have to go into details sometimes to find out

00:52:06.567 --> 00:52:11.234
what, basically, are our diseases within our body.

00:52:11.234 --> 00:52:14.234
We should know what our disease is.

00:52:14.234 --> 00:52:18.601
Sometimes even if you have an ordinary cold,
it is a disease, according to Sahaja Yoga.

00:52:18.601 --> 00:52:21.967
You should be a normal person.

00:52:21.967 --> 00:52:24.834
Supposing you are suffering from, say, the terrible disease,

00:52:24.834 --> 00:52:33.834
the greatest nuisance and the blessing of London
and England put together – is cold.

00:52:33.834 --> 00:52:39.167
Call it hay fever, day fever, or anything!

00:52:39.167 --> 00:52:43.101
So it is due to what?

00:52:43.101 --> 00:52:52.567
It is due to basically within us less resistance, no immunity.

00:52:52.567 --> 00:52:58.801
Less resistance comes to us because of the lack of calcium within us.

00:52:58.801 --> 00:53:01.634
Those people who have taken proper care in childhood,

00:53:01.634 --> 00:53:05.101
taken vitamin A and D

00:53:05.101 --> 00:53:12.401
and good massage, say with cod liver oil or olive oil and things like that,

00:53:12.401 --> 00:53:15.034
and proper sunning of the body is done,

00:53:15.034 --> 00:53:18.901
such people suffer less from cold.

00:53:18.901 --> 00:53:22.901
Especially the Vishuddhi Chakra problem it is.

00:53:22.901 --> 00:53:27.000
Now those people who have not been careful about their Vishuddhi Chakra

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.967
get the disease settled within themselves,

00:53:30.967 --> 00:53:35.201
but when this disease is settled, what happens actually?

00:53:35.201 --> 00:53:41.934
What is the reason, as we said that it is the left hand side problem.

00:53:41.934 --> 00:53:46.801
Cold is a left hand side problem.

00:53:46.801 --> 00:53:53.201
That means cold has something to do with your emotional side.

00:53:53.201 --> 00:53:58.034
That means there’s something also wrong emotionally with you.

00:53:58.034 --> 00:54:03.634
So it indicates that you have some emotional problem.

00:54:03.634 --> 00:54:06.201
According to Sahaja Yoga, to overcome cold

00:54:06.201 --> 00:54:12.634
one should see into this emotional life of oneself.

00:54:12.634 --> 00:54:14.201
What are you doing about your emotions?

00:54:14.201 --> 00:54:27.967
For example, as soon as you’re affected by emotions, you will start crying or sneezing.

00:54:27.967 --> 00:54:33.601
This is a fact.
If these are girls, they’ll start crying.

00:54:33.601 --> 00:54:36.401
If they are men, they’ll start coughing or sneezing.

00:54:36.401 --> 00:54:46.734
They’ll cough for nothing at all.
You see they will go.

00:54:46.734 --> 00:54:52.901
Isn’t it a fact? Unnecessarily they’ll be doing like this.
Is an emotional thing,

00:54:52.901 --> 00:54:58.000
to attract attention maybe or whatever it is.
To say that how pitiable they are, you see,

00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:03.134
is a thing by which we show our pitiable condition.

00:55:03.134 --> 00:55:11.000
You see, is a thing, we reduce ourselves to a position by which we try to, you see, excite the pity in other person.

00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:15.367
So this cold is due to our emotional problem.

00:55:15.367 --> 00:55:19.234
Now so we should see what is our emotional problem.

00:55:19.234 --> 00:55:27.267
We should find out how much ‘Romeos’ we are

00:55:27.267 --> 00:55:35.467
And how much delight of life we miss by that.

00:55:35.467 --> 00:55:39.901
Once you start understanding

00:55:39.901 --> 00:55:46.000
that you are your own Romeo and you are your own Juliet,

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:52.167
most of you will get rid of your colds. Take it from Me.

00:55:52.167 --> 00:55:58.034
It is some sort of an emotional problem.
Could be with your father.

00:55:58.034 --> 00:56:00.801
A person who is very attached to his father.

00:56:00.801 --> 00:56:06.767
‘Attached’ is the word best is, gets also attached to cold.

00:56:06.767 --> 00:56:10.034
Attached to mother is even worse.

00:56:10.034 --> 00:56:13.901
If somebody is very attached to her mother, you see,

00:56:13.901 --> 00:56:16.667
then all reasoning fails

00:56:16.667 --> 00:56:19.401
and then the mother misbehaves or does something

00:56:19.401 --> 00:56:27.334
and the child feels very hurt, the child cries, he gets the cold.

00:56:27.334 --> 00:56:33.567
Any such attachment which makes you foolish should be given up,

00:56:33.567 --> 00:56:37.334
to get rid of your cold, I mean to say.

00:56:37.334 --> 00:56:40.934
Whatever makes you stupid, foolish

00:56:40.934 --> 00:56:45.634
or hankering after someone,

00:56:45.634 --> 00:56:51.167
creates troubles like colds. ‘Romeos’ specially.

00:56:51.167 --> 00:56:54.201
Then very beloved children,

00:56:54.201 --> 00:56:57.767
beloved fathers, beloved mothers, you see,

00:56:57.767 --> 00:57:03.667
the ones for them their daughter is important,
their son is important.

00:57:03.667 --> 00:57:07.467
Some people just don’t love their children and if someone loves

00:57:07.467 --> 00:57:10.234
they’ll dump them onto everybody else.

00:57:10.234 --> 00:57:16.667
So these two types of it.
You must know that you are just a trustee of your child

00:57:16.667 --> 00:57:19.567
and as far as your ‘Romeo-ness’ is concerned,

00:57:19.567 --> 00:57:25.467
you are just to see drama of your Romeo, that’s all.

00:57:25.467 --> 00:57:30.534
Then this detachment will take place and a simple disease like cold

00:57:30.534 --> 00:57:34.634
which looks so horrible, incurable, can be cured.

00:57:34.634 --> 00:57:41.067
As long as you people have cold,
without having any romantic feelings Myself,

00:57:41.067 --> 00:57:43.967
I also get it.
So I request you

00:57:43.967 --> 00:57:49.434
to rise above these things and become more sensible,

00:57:49.434 --> 00:58:02.267
and your attitude should be of enhancing mutual understanding, mutual love, and not romantic feelings.

00:58:02.267 --> 00:58:08.434
But worse than that is dry feelings,
on the right hand side you know.

00:58:08.434 --> 00:58:14.000
Then if you have a dry throat you cannot even speak.

00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:19.201
Suddenly you find -finished.

00:58:19.201 --> 00:58:23.334
you just can’t speak because you are dried.

00:58:23.334 --> 00:58:28.867
So the other side is where some people try some psychological tricks with their wives or husbands

00:58:28.867 --> 00:58:32.801
like “I will not speak”.

00:58:32.801 --> 00:58:37.834
This I’m telling you just an emotional side of life.

00:58:37.834 --> 00:58:44.067
“I’ll not talk to her. I’ll not speak.
I’ll behave like this."

00:58:44.067 --> 00:58:48.601
Dryness. That also kills the delight.

00:58:48.601 --> 00:58:54.167
The one is overdoing it and one is not doing of it.

00:58:54.167 --> 00:59:00.067
You see, either you’ll take sugar which is one ton in one glass,

00:59:00.067 --> 00:59:06.834
or you will not take sugar at all.

00:59:06.834 --> 00:59:11.201
Not more, not less, you see, to have the optimum delight of tea.

00:59:11.201 --> 00:59:14.401
In the same way, in life also,

00:59:14.401 --> 00:59:20.267
you should not take too much of something and too little of another thing.

00:59:20.267 --> 00:59:25.167
Now somebody who’s married now, for that person, Indian women specially,

00:59:25.167 --> 00:59:30.801
husband becomes last one, then everything else is zero.

00:59:30.801 --> 00:59:33.834
Then such women are useless.

00:59:33.834 --> 00:59:39.934
Or men that I’ve seen here, they are just mad at their women.

00:59:39.934 --> 00:59:42.367
For them also, life is useless.

00:59:42.367 --> 00:59:44.934
So take a balanced attitude of the whole thing is that

00:59:44.934 --> 00:59:52.334
it is in you is the person who is loving your wife,

00:59:52.334 --> 00:59:57.701
who is also within you.
You are your wife, you are your husband.

00:59:57.701 --> 01:00:02.267
Now the wife who is your wife outside,

01:00:02.267 --> 01:00:07.501
if she just does not tally with the wife that you have within your mind,

01:00:07.501 --> 01:00:13.467
that should not upset you, because that wife is always with you.

01:00:13.467 --> 01:00:17.367
Once this understanding develops,
you see your partnership

01:00:17.367 --> 01:00:19.701
by the way I found your letter;

01:00:19.701 --> 01:00:29.701
the partnership of husband and wife could be absolutely perfect.

01:00:29.701 --> 01:00:32.334
Now with the children as I said...

01:00:32.334 --> 01:00:41.367
Hello, by what train did you come?
Sahaja Yogi: The late one.

01:00:41.367 --> 01:00:44.734
Real late one this one was! What about your food?

01:00:44.734 --> 01:00:45.501
Sahaja Yogi: We both had some.

01:00:45.501 --> 01:00:47.201
Really? Where?

01:00:47.201 --> 01:00:49.134
Sahaja Yogi: In Winchester.

01:00:49.134 --> 01:00:51.701
Though you were telling something else.

01:00:51.701 --> 01:00:57.834
Where? I mean if you are telling the truth
you’ll tell the same thing.

01:00:57.834 --> 01:01:00.167
Sahaja Yogi: We had some chicken from the Fish & chip shop.

01:01:00.167 --> 01:01:04.601
Alright. There is some food if you want, please have.

01:01:04.601 --> 01:01:09.801
Go, have something, you see it's very late.
Let them have, come along, let them have.

01:01:09.801 --> 01:01:13.101
You know? Who knows?
Good idea.

01:01:13.101 --> 01:01:16.201
Please Let them have.

01:01:16.201 --> 01:01:25.701
Very nice you both could come.
We were just missing you all.

01:01:25.701 --> 01:01:34.701
Yes, very good, very cool and nice, Let me see
when have you food, both of you. Now it's very good.

01:01:34.701 --> 01:01:39.934
May God bless you. So you go and have your food.
Go and then come in.

01:01:39.934 --> 01:01:55.834
Now, why make it so light for you to understand
that marriage is not a serious problem.

01:01:55.834 --> 01:01:59.801
As long as you have your ideal with yourself

01:01:59.801 --> 01:02:07.834
and you don’t try to impose that on your wife,
or the wife does not try to impose that on your husband.

01:02:07.834 --> 01:02:12.267
Let the wife be a wife and husband be a husband.

01:02:12.267 --> 01:02:17.701
But the wife should not become the husband
and the husband should not become the wife.

01:02:17.701 --> 01:02:20.834
If that happens, then I don’t know how to correct it,

01:02:20.834 --> 01:02:24.601
because that’s something absurd if that happens.

01:02:24.601 --> 01:02:33.734
Now, on that the main thing one has to know is
that you are married to have children,

01:02:33.734 --> 01:02:36.667
not to be Romeo and Juliet anymore.

01:02:36.667 --> 01:02:42.701
You better have your children. And then the children that will be born to Sahaja Yogis

01:02:42.701 --> 01:02:48.467
are going to be realized souls, a tremendous source of energy.

01:02:48.467 --> 01:02:53.067
That’s why you are married,
that’s why you are going to have children.

01:02:53.067 --> 01:02:56.601
Then look after your children with respect, regard.

01:02:56.601 --> 01:03:03.701
Don’t spoil them! And develop in that love of Sahaja Yoga.

01:03:03.701 --> 01:03:08.000
Now this started with our Hamsa Chakra.

01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.901
Now see the Hamsa Chakra is the left and the right.

01:03:11.901 --> 01:03:15.067
The left is the woman, the right is the man.

01:03:15.067 --> 01:03:17.167
They meet at Hamsa.

01:03:17.167 --> 01:03:23.167
So this is the wedding place of your left and right.

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:29.134
If there is no balance between the two, there is a problem.

01:03:29.134 --> 01:03:34.801
They have to be equal.
But they are not similar.

01:03:34.801 --> 01:03:38.167
Left is left. Right is right.

01:03:38.167 --> 01:03:44.234
So the right must be on the right hand side,
left must be on the left hand side

01:03:44.234 --> 01:03:51.467
and here when they come, they marry,
and this is the point one must know

01:03:51.467 --> 01:03:56.467
that, whatever is the function of a wife is,
she should do that first

01:03:56.467 --> 01:04:01.701
whatever is the function of the husband is,
he should do that first.

01:04:01.701 --> 01:04:08.067
And then the secondary functions of life can be shared and understood.

01:04:08.067 --> 01:04:13.867
But it’s not possible that the wife goes to work and the husband starts producing children.

01:04:13.867 --> 01:04:18.267
You cannot do it!

01:04:18.267 --> 01:04:24.000
And the other way round.
So whatever is the work is so important.

01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.867
To be a mother, I think, is the most important.

01:04:26.867 --> 01:04:29.667
Today if you didn’t have a mother,

01:04:29.667 --> 01:04:32.201
which father would have done this work, you tell Me.

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:34.967
Which one? Can you think of anyone?

01:04:34.967 --> 01:04:39.467
There may be ‘Father in Heaven’,
but Father on this Earth

01:04:39.467 --> 01:04:43.634
working with all Sahaja Yogis, let Me see which one is there.

01:04:43.634 --> 01:04:45.767
Anyone of these fathers, you call them.

01:04:45.767 --> 01:04:51.467
Nicely to sit down on Heaven and watch the whole stuff. But who’s going to do the work?

01:04:51.467 --> 01:04:58.534
Washing the dirty linen and washing all the napkins
and things is done by Mother.

01:04:58.534 --> 01:05:04.634
She does this with love and attention and with care,

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:12.101
and She is the one who knows how to grow Her children. Is the job of a mother.

01:05:12.101 --> 01:05:13.767
So Mother’s job Mother can do.

01:05:13.767 --> 01:05:16.934
Father can sit in Heaven very nicely.

01:05:16.934 --> 01:05:18.667
All thanks goes to the Father.

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:22.534
While the Mother is doing a thankless job here!

01:05:22.534 --> 01:05:24.767
Alright, doesn’t matter.

01:05:24.767 --> 01:05:28.967
It is so, so should be accepted,
whatever may be the situation,

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:33.367
whatever may be the position.

01:05:33.367 --> 01:05:37.734
Now at Hamsa Chakra, this understanding must come

01:05:37.734 --> 01:05:44.534
that you must balance both the nadis, the left and the right.

01:05:44.534 --> 01:05:50.301
Now to balance the left and the right,
the best way is to do some breathing,

01:05:50.301 --> 01:05:57.901
is to take the air through one nostril
and keep it waiting here for a while

01:05:57.901 --> 01:06:00.667
and then allow it to go out of the other.

01:06:00.667 --> 01:06:02.567
Then you breathe in with this one,

01:06:02.567 --> 01:06:06.867
allow it to stay here for a while and
then allow it to go down.

01:06:06.867 --> 01:06:10.067
But it is to be done very slowly.

01:06:10.067 --> 01:06:14.067
Not in a hurry, not too much.
Only thrice.

01:06:14.067 --> 01:06:16.167
Best thing as I’ve told you is neti.

01:06:16.167 --> 01:06:23.000
If not that, another thing I have seen that those inhalers, you see that you get, are very good.

01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:32.534
The neti thing that I’ve given you.
If you fill the water below the spout and fill it,

01:06:32.534 --> 01:06:37.967
put in some two, three drops of one of those things
that you get for inhaling

01:06:37.967 --> 01:06:44.234
and put that neti thing in one nose only,
and with another nose it goes up.

01:06:44.234 --> 01:06:47.867
Then you come, bring it here, it goes up and clears it out.

01:06:47.867 --> 01:06:49.801
It’s a very good thing.

01:06:49.801 --> 01:06:56.534
If you do it every night before sleeping,
in three, four days you’ll be absolutely cleared out.

01:06:56.534 --> 01:07:01.401
But the main thing is: it comes because of imbalances in our temperaments.

01:07:01.401 --> 01:07:04.167
Like a man is a man, woman is a woman, alright,

01:07:04.167 --> 01:07:09.967
so the woman starts dominating a man
or a man starts dominating the woman.

01:07:09.967 --> 01:07:14.767
The balance is broken.
Once you understand the woman is very important

01:07:14.767 --> 01:07:17.867
without the woman you cannot, could not have been here.
Alright?

01:07:17.867 --> 01:07:20.634
Without a woman you cannot be here.

01:07:20.634 --> 01:07:25.634
Man is very important that a woman has no meaning without a man.

01:07:25.634 --> 01:07:31.067
You see, Shakti has no meaning without God.
For whom is She working?

01:07:31.067 --> 01:07:34.567
For whom is She doing all this? For God to be pleased.

01:07:34.567 --> 01:07:37.534
If there’s nobody to see the job, why should She do it?

01:07:37.534 --> 01:07:40.467
So both have great meaning.
And if you understand

01:07:40.467 --> 01:07:45.567
that both beings within us are balanced, understood, respected

01:07:45.567 --> 01:07:49.301
in their proper ways

01:07:49.301 --> 01:08:04.701
and shared and coordinated, the personalities
in proper understanding, respect and love,

01:08:04.701 --> 01:08:09.234
your Hamsa will be alright.
You’ll feel better.

01:08:09.234 --> 01:08:12.167
So you have to correct your ideas

01:08:12.167 --> 01:08:18.567
about marriage, about women,
about men, about yourself.

01:08:18.567 --> 01:08:22.967
That’s very important
because it is a very big emotional thing

01:08:22.967 --> 01:08:27.767
and, as the left side is weak,

01:08:27.767 --> 01:08:31.867
all people who have left side weak get cold.

01:08:31.867 --> 01:08:37.901
And all the things that have to do with your...
they call it bulgam, is it? What’s it called?

01:08:37.901 --> 01:08:38.801
Sahaja Yogis: Phlegm.

01:08:38.801 --> 01:08:45.734
Phlegm. Phlegm. Phlegm.
It has to do with your phlegm.

01:08:45.734 --> 01:08:52.801
So the emotional side is to be properly nourished and looked after

01:08:52.801 --> 01:09:03.434
and one has to know that your dignity is the most important.

01:09:03.434 --> 01:09:10.134
Anything undignified is not love.
Love is very dignified.

01:09:10.134 --> 01:09:18.867
And if you keep your dignity, you’ll be amazed how you will be able to solve certain problems.

01:09:18.867 --> 01:09:23.467
Now, again I’ll ask you a question.
Now, how many have answered the questions?

01:09:23.467 --> 01:09:26.134
Most of them you answered very well.

01:09:26.134 --> 01:09:33.567
Now one more question I will ask.

01:09:33.567 --> 01:09:40.467
Very simple, not so difficult.

01:09:40.467 --> 01:09:47.201
That: what is the difference between a baddha and a bhoot?

01:09:47.201 --> 01:09:57.401
How will you make out? A hindrance and a bhoot.

01:09:57.401 --> 01:10:02.201
Sahaja Yogi: Bhoots will move around.

01:10:02.201 --> 01:10:03.267
And baddha?

01:10:03.267 --> 01:10:07.901
Sahaja Yogi: Stays there. Just describing,
it’s a block at that point.

01:10:07.901 --> 01:10:10.434
Though it’s correct, you said is correct,

01:10:10.434 --> 01:10:16.867
but it is not absolutely precise.
It is like this, I tell you. It’s correct.

01:10:16.867 --> 01:10:20.434
I mean what he says is the correct answer but it’s not so precise.

01:10:20.434 --> 01:10:26.234
Baddha will also move.
I’ll tell you how.

01:10:26.234 --> 01:10:30.334
Baddha is always in the centers or on your organs, say.

01:10:30.334 --> 01:10:35.967
If it is, say, in your, for example in the liver,

01:10:35.967 --> 01:10:39.567
this baddha may come in the center

01:10:39.567 --> 01:10:48.767
and then it will start moving from your here to here as the Kundalini will move. Alright?

01:10:48.767 --> 01:10:55.167
But baddha doesn’t have its arbitrary movement.

01:10:55.167 --> 01:10:57.667
As you move the Kundalini, the baddha moves.

01:10:57.667 --> 01:11:01.134
‘Baddha’ means hindrance. Alright?

01:11:01.134 --> 01:11:06.967
But a bhoot is arbitrary.
It moves.

01:11:06.967 --> 01:11:10.467
It will be one moment here, it will be one moment there.

01:11:10.467 --> 01:11:12.901
It will move this side, it will move that side.

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:16.467
It will go to the right heart, then it will come to the left heart.

01:11:16.467 --> 01:11:19.667
If it is arbitrary behaviour,

01:11:19.667 --> 01:11:25.801
that means it is not controlled by your movement of your fingers through the Kundalini awakening

01:11:25.801 --> 01:11:29.534
that means it is not controlled by your movement of your fingers through the Kundalini awakening

01:11:29.534 --> 01:11:32.867
Now understand what I’m saying by decisive thing,

01:11:32.867 --> 01:11:37.367
that, one thing is arbitrary, works on its own,

01:11:37.367 --> 01:11:46.000
and the other is in your control.
You’re taking it out yourself.

01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:51.101
Like you can say that if there’s some lump in the body,

01:11:51.101 --> 01:11:54.934
it may start moving with the, say, bloodstream or something,

01:11:54.934 --> 01:11:59.601
some force acting upon it.
But by itself, it does not.

01:11:59.601 --> 01:12:06.767
But if there’s a worm, a living worm, it will move by itself.

01:12:06.767 --> 01:12:17.401
So the last question is then,
how do you manage the baddha and the bhoot?

01:12:17.401 --> 01:12:21.667
How will you take out the bhoot of other people without getting yourself into it?

01:12:21.667 --> 01:12:25.667
Otherwise the person whose bhoot has to be taken out

01:12:25.667 --> 01:12:31.901
will put three bhoots in you and five in the others.

01:12:31.901 --> 01:12:39.734
I have seen many a times they’ll come and tell Me,
“Mother, he’s possessed.” Alright.

01:12:39.734 --> 01:12:47.734
And they themselves are!

01:12:47.734 --> 01:12:52.834
How do you take out? Come along.

01:12:52.834 --> 01:12:54.934
Sahaja Yogini: Bandhan

01:12:54.934 --> 01:12:57.034
Sahaja Yogi: You can throw the bhoot into a candle.

01:12:57.034 --> 01:13:01.201
What? Bandhan? No!

01:13:01.201 --> 01:13:06.267
No, First, first, that of course,
you all know what I’m doing, but…

01:13:06.267 --> 01:13:10.301
Sahaja Yogi: You can throw the bhoot into a candle.

01:13:10.301 --> 01:13:12.801
I mean, I’m saying a real one.

01:13:12.801 --> 01:13:18.000
He’s not even afraid of candles.

01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:25.301
Sahaja Yogini: Say the mantra to Mukti Dayini.

01:13:25.301 --> 01:13:27.034
Sahaja Yogini: The Lord’s Prayer

01:13:27.034 --> 01:13:31.501
There’s no general thing about it.
Alright?

01:13:31.501 --> 01:13:41.701
All answers are correct but they are not complete.

01:13:41.701 --> 01:13:56.067
There are ways and methods according to different bhoots.

01:13:56.067 --> 01:13:58.501
They are trying to solve the problems

01:13:58.501 --> 01:14:08.067
But said it’s rather difficult!

01:14:08.067 --> 01:14:14.901
Now, first of all, you see a person who is possessed.

01:14:14.901 --> 01:14:25.901
I mean you are sure he is possessed, so you do like this, you see.

01:14:25.901 --> 01:14:28.234
Take a form, you have to take a form

01:14:28.234 --> 01:14:32.067
because you have to fight it.
You take an aggressive form.

01:14:32.067 --> 01:14:37.501
Sahaja Yogi: Karate, Tony’s Karate [Tony Cooly].

01:14:37.501 --> 01:14:39.934
Karate, yes. Something like that.

01:14:39.934 --> 01:14:46.367
So then, I mean inside you become higher than that person.

01:14:46.367 --> 01:14:56.167
Otherwise if you go like

01:14:56.167 --> 01:15:00.401
After some time

01:15:00.401 --> 01:15:06.667
So you go with a great force on that person.

01:15:06.667 --> 01:15:10.767
You put a bandhan and say, “Now sit down.”
Talk to him like this.

01:15:10.767 --> 01:15:13.734
You don’t go and say, “Please sit down,”

01:15:13.734 --> 01:15:17.201
because the thing will come and sit in you.

01:15:17.201 --> 01:15:19.567
Just say, “Now sit down.” Alright.

01:15:19.567 --> 01:15:25.467
There you have to say as if you are not compromising on this.

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:28.334
No compromises.

01:15:28.334 --> 01:15:35.667
Then you ask the person various questions,
after giving yourself a bandhan

01:15:35.667 --> 01:15:41.401
and do that to verify what sort of a bhoot it could be.
That’s the best.

01:15:41.401 --> 01:15:46.467
First of all you ask that person,
“Have you been to any guru?”

01:15:46.467 --> 01:15:53.000
So now you know at least sixteen of them.
And you know how to take them out, also.

01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:57.934
So you find out which bhoot he has been to.

01:15:57.934 --> 01:16:02.301
If it is a guru, you just ask the person
does he still believe in that guru.

01:16:02.301 --> 01:16:04.867
If so, you have nothing to do with that person.

01:16:04.867 --> 01:16:07.201
You have no business.
You say, “I’m sorry, sir” …

01:16:07.201 --> 01:16:11.167
Not sorry You say, “Please go away.”

01:16:11.167 --> 01:16:13.534
If you say “sorry” it will come inside.

01:16:13.534 --> 01:16:18.167
Any inviting word you should not use.

01:16:18.167 --> 01:16:24.101
Just say, “Alright, finished!” you get out from that one.

01:16:24.101 --> 01:16:26.967
But in case he says, “I am possessed.
I know I am in trouble,

01:16:26.967 --> 01:16:31.867
I’ve got this thing” and all that,
then you tell that person that

01:16:31.867 --> 01:16:36.101
“What is the name of your guru? What is the mantra you got?

01:16:36.101 --> 01:16:39.767
How many years have you been?”
Like that, you ask the question.

01:16:39.767 --> 01:16:41.967
If he is truthful and if he tells you that,

01:16:41.967 --> 01:16:47.501
then you exactly know where the mantra is,
what has happened to him.

01:16:47.501 --> 01:16:53.767
If it is a guru, then it has to be in the Void.

01:16:53.767 --> 01:17:03.201
If it is in the Void you tell him to say the mantra of Adi Guru,

01:17:03.201 --> 01:17:07.767
or ask the question, “Mother, are You the…?” on the photograph.

01:17:07.767 --> 01:17:12.267
Keep the photograph in front of your face like a mask if possible.

01:17:12.267 --> 01:17:16.201
Don’t allow you yourself to be exposed but give the photograph to the man.

01:17:16.201 --> 01:17:20.167
You say, “Now ask the question to this photograph.”

01:17:20.167 --> 01:17:25.534
Now if the person asks the question, the Kundalini
will start coming here doing

01:17:25.534 --> 01:17:30.000
“gragaralgagal.” He’ll also see the thing there,
you see, bubbling up.

01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:37.334
Then you should say that, after asking the question, “Now you say that, ‘You are the guru’!”

01:17:37.334 --> 01:17:41.301
If the person is possessed by a guru, then if you know the name of the guru,

01:17:41.301 --> 01:17:43.767
then you know the mantra.
When he’s doing all these things,

01:17:43.767 --> 01:17:47.534
you go on saying “NarakasuraMardini”
or “Mahishasura Mardini”

01:17:47.534 --> 01:17:52.767
or anything like that, whatever you have to do.
Or “Sarva-asura Mardini”

01:17:52.767 --> 01:17:58.067
For guru this thing, the best thing is salt, vibrated salt.

01:17:58.067 --> 01:18:02.534
You give some vibrated salt with water to that person to drink.

01:18:02.534 --> 01:18:07.167
It’s not easy to get rid of the guru, so you tell him very firmly

01:18:07.167 --> 01:18:10.867
that he’s one of the horrible ones we have ever known,

01:18:10.867 --> 01:18:13.667
so you have to work very hard to get rid of it.

01:18:13.667 --> 01:18:20.734
You give him salt, give him all that, let him do it.
And do not hurry up.

01:18:20.734 --> 01:18:24.301
Tell him it is going to take time, it will be alright,

01:18:24.301 --> 01:18:26.267
and what troubles people had with this,

01:18:26.267 --> 01:18:29.401
and he’ll have to work hard.

01:18:29.401 --> 01:18:33.567
This is one type of bhoots you will find.

01:18:33.567 --> 01:18:39.234
Then you find these are guru bhoots and which takes time,

01:18:39.234 --> 01:18:44.301
which are very difficult and they can take you up,

01:18:44.301 --> 01:18:47.067
it can be very dangerous.

01:18:47.067 --> 01:18:54.401
But say, somebody becomes blind with a bhoot.

01:18:54.401 --> 01:18:56.501
His eyes are open and he’s blind.

01:18:56.501 --> 01:19:05.601
That’s sure shot he is blind because of a bhoot.
Two types of blindness are possible.

01:19:05.601 --> 01:19:12.534
The Left Swadhishthana will be catching
and you will see it is due to bhoot.

01:19:12.534 --> 01:19:15.034
But it can also be Left Swadhisthana catching

01:19:15.034 --> 01:19:20.434
and becoming blind could be with diabetes.

01:19:20.434 --> 01:19:22.934
Could be the combination of both.

01:19:22.934 --> 01:19:25.034
So you ask him if he has diabetes or not.

01:19:25.034 --> 01:19:29.434
If the person has no diabetes, then definitely it is the bhoot.

01:19:29.434 --> 01:19:37.401
Now what do you do to take out that kind of a bhoot?

01:19:37.401 --> 01:19:39.401
Sahaja Yogi: You use an enlightened candle.

01:19:39.401 --> 01:19:43.467
You take My hand.

01:19:43.467 --> 01:19:48.401
Photograph, only hand.

01:19:48.401 --> 01:19:52.667
You have photographs of My hand,
and put a candle before that photograph.

01:19:52.667 --> 01:19:57.534
All these photographs that you have separately have meanings.

01:19:57.534 --> 01:20:03.967
Put the candle and behind that is the hand

01:20:03.967 --> 01:20:08.534
and ask the person to see the light,
if he can see the light.

01:20:08.534 --> 01:20:13.101
Gradually, you’ll be amazed he will start seeing.

01:20:13.101 --> 01:20:15.901
This is to be used.
You see, in Sahaja Yoga,

01:20:15.901 --> 01:20:19.467
one has also to be precise just like the English words.

01:20:19.467 --> 01:20:21.867
If you are precise, it comes out.

01:20:21.867 --> 01:20:26.201
If you are not precise then you try this, you try that, it won’t work out.

01:20:26.201 --> 01:20:29.467
But if you have a photograph of My hands

01:20:29.467 --> 01:20:38.301
you should ask the person to see the photograph of the hand.

01:20:38.301 --> 01:20:43.367
By seeing the light, gradually the person will start seeing the hand,

01:20:43.367 --> 01:20:46.367
and then gradually the person will become alright.

01:20:46.367 --> 01:20:52.801
I’ve seen one person getting the eyes within ten minutes.

01:20:52.801 --> 01:20:55.667
But in that, if the Left Swadhishthana is catching,

01:20:55.667 --> 01:20:59.567
if the person has no diabetes and eyes are open,

01:20:59.567 --> 01:21:03.167
then it is definitely a bhoot, nothing else.

01:21:03.167 --> 01:21:06.201
Even if some people might say, “She lost her eyes because of,

01:21:06.201 --> 01:21:09.534
this girl lost her eyes because there was a fire in the house.”

01:21:09.534 --> 01:21:14.101
But she got frightened and the bhoots sat in here and she became blind. They are connected to both things.

01:21:14.101 --> 01:21:18.467
Actually eyes cannot remain open if the eyes are burned out.

01:21:18.467 --> 01:21:21.267
So if the eyes are open and absolutely normal to look at

01:21:21.267 --> 01:21:23.367
and the person cannot see, the light is out,

01:21:23.367 --> 01:21:26.567
that means there’s a bhoot.

01:21:26.567 --> 01:21:30.601
So these things can be very easily done.

01:21:30.601 --> 01:21:36.101
Sahaja Yogi: How do you do it?

01:21:36.101 --> 01:21:39.634
Photograph like this, and the light in front.

01:21:39.634 --> 01:21:41.467
It will improve your eyesight also.

01:21:41.467 --> 01:21:46.267
My hands should be used, very good for the eyes.

01:21:46.267 --> 01:21:50.234
My hands are extremely good for your eyes.

01:21:50.234 --> 01:21:53.767
If you can see My hands with the light,

01:21:53.767 --> 01:21:57.534
very good for your eyes.

01:21:57.534 --> 01:22:07.534
Now what are good My feet for?

01:22:07.534 --> 01:22:13.267
Feet photograph, what it is good for?

01:22:13.267 --> 01:22:24.434
Sahaja Yogi: Agnya.

01:22:24.434 --> 01:22:28.867
Very good for ego.

01:22:28.867 --> 01:22:33.667
And also superego.

01:22:33.667 --> 01:22:37.667
Is very good for people who suffer from ego or superego, My feet.

01:22:37.667 --> 01:22:44.967
Because, such people are very gross.
And the feet solve the problem.

01:22:44.967 --> 01:22:46.967
So just use My feet.

01:22:46.967 --> 01:22:49.967
If they see My Face, the ego will start working,

01:22:49.967 --> 01:22:54.167
“This face is like that, it should be like that – this, that.”

01:22:54.167 --> 01:23:00.567
Superego might give problems.
Even supraconscious will give you problems.

01:23:00.567 --> 01:23:09.534
But feet, even if you are supraconscious, they’ll correct your problems.

01:23:09.534 --> 01:23:13.434
Feet are not only powerful

01:23:13.434 --> 01:23:19.667
but they go up to the grossest point where you are.

01:23:19.667 --> 01:23:22.267
Any type of person. Say, a drunkard

01:23:22.267 --> 01:23:30.901
and all the bad things which are, a criminal, some sort of a man,

01:23:30.901 --> 01:23:35.567
you just use My Feet, You’ll be alright.

01:23:35.567 --> 01:23:42.367
Face won’t work for him.
Face is for the seekers.

01:23:42.367 --> 01:23:50.567
But for all such people who are absolutely incorrigible types,

01:23:50.567 --> 01:23:54.734
feet is the best. Those who have extreme ego,

01:23:54.734 --> 01:24:00.567
those who have extreme superego – extreme.
Feet are very important.

01:24:00.567 --> 01:24:03.767
You also sometimes watch My feet.

01:24:03.767 --> 01:24:06.534
That’s a very good way, exercise.

01:24:06.534 --> 01:24:12.467
Just watch My Feet to get rid of your grossness.

01:24:12.467 --> 01:24:21.101
Just watch with your eyes.
How are you going to watch through your Sahastrara?

01:24:21.101 --> 01:24:25.567
But also with Sahastrara you can see.

01:24:25.567 --> 01:24:40.534
See just see.

01:24:40.534 --> 01:24:45.334
Sahaja Yogi: Mother, do You think if we used Your feet in the photo in the newspaper advertising we’d

01:24:45.334 --> 01:24:46.634
get more people?

01:24:46.634 --> 01:24:48.267
Will be a better idea.

01:24:48.267 --> 01:24:49.434
Sahaja Yogi: We’ll try that.

01:24:49.434 --> 01:24:54.967
But you see I don’t know.
Try. Very good idea.

01:24:54.967 --> 01:24:57.867
You see on My books and all that we have tried.

01:24:57.867 --> 01:25:05.567
On so many things I have tried, put My feet.
Indians understand it.

01:25:05.567 --> 01:25:10.434
Sahaja Yogi: Do you think they’d understand in the US?

01:25:10.434 --> 01:25:14.467
Sahaja Yogi: Well, you don’t have to say Your name in the same thing.

01:25:14.467 --> 01:25:15.834
Just put My feet.

01:25:15.834 --> 01:25:17.401
Sahaja Yogi: Will just let it work through.

01:25:17.401 --> 01:25:22.201
We’ll put SahajaYoga, we won’t say anything about Whose feet they are.

01:25:22.201 --> 01:25:28.134
Try. It is very good. They’re tremendous.

01:25:28.134 --> 01:25:37.101
See all the lights reacting.

01:25:37.101 --> 01:25:41.867
You see?
