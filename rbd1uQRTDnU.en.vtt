00:00:07.216 --> 00:00:14.458
It’s a great pleasure that from all over the world

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:21.750
people have gathered to worship Shiva.

00:00:21.951 --> 00:00:29.332
Actually we should say it is Sadashiva that we are going to worship today.

00:00:31.996 --> 00:00:40.176
As you know the difference between Sadashiva and Shri Shiva.

00:00:41.512 --> 00:00:51.460
Sadashiva is the God Almighty

00:00:51.785 --> 00:01:01.065
and He is a witness of the play of the Primordial Mother.

00:01:08.608 --> 00:01:16.985
The combination between Sadashiva and the Primordial Mother Adi Shakti

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:25.326
is just like a moon and the moonlight or the sun or the sunlight.

00:01:25.527 --> 00:01:30.847
We cannot understand such relationship in human being, among human marriages

00:01:31.048 --> 00:01:35.673
or among human relationships.

00:01:40.512 --> 00:01:45.406
So whatever the Adi Shakti’s creating,

00:01:46.234 --> 00:01:56.170
which is the desire of Sadashiva, is being witnessed by Him.

00:01:57.094 --> 00:02:03.653
And when He is watching this creation

00:02:03.854 --> 00:02:12.884
He is witnessing all of it into all details.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.158
He witnesses the whole universe

00:02:20.935 --> 00:02:26.489
and He also witnesses this Mother Earth,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.853
all the creation that is done by the Adi Shakti.

00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:38.923
His power is of witnessing

00:02:40.154 --> 00:02:47.987
and the power of Adi Shakti

00:02:48.384 --> 00:02:53.874
is this all pervading power of love.

00:02:56.203 --> 00:03:02.658
So the God Almighty, the Father, the Primordial Father, we can say,

00:03:04.761 --> 00:03:12.789
expresses His desire, His Iccha Shakti as the Primordial Mother

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.869
and She expresses Her power as love.

00:03:20.673 --> 00:03:26.834
So the relationship between the two is extremely

00:03:29.632 --> 00:03:34.737
understanding, very deep,

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:39.232
and whatever She‘s creating,

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:46.308
if She finds, if He finds there is some problem

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:52.031
or there are people, human beings specially

00:03:52.232 --> 00:04:00.969
who are trying to obstruct Her work, or even the Gods

00:04:02.017 --> 00:04:09.160
who are not the deities are trying to express their egos,

00:04:09.845 --> 00:04:15.141
He is the one who brings forth their destruction.

00:04:17.457 --> 00:04:24.644
So He is the one who is responsible for the destructive power.

00:04:25.758 --> 00:04:32.462
He is reflected in the hearts of human beings,

00:04:32.663 --> 00:04:38.245
among all the creations He pulsates.

00:04:38.446 --> 00:04:48.129
But that pulses, pulsation is the energy of the Primordial Mother.

00:04:48.896 --> 00:04:57.927
And He can destroy anything that goes against the plans of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:58.128 --> 00:05:05.737
Adi Shakti is love, She forgives and She loves.

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:12.637
She loves Her creation. She wants the creation to prosper,

00:05:12.838 --> 00:05:17.475
to go up to the same level for which it was created.

00:05:17.676 --> 00:05:27.246
She wants human beings to go to that level where

00:05:27.447 --> 00:05:32.427
they enter into the Kingdom of God, Kingdom of Sadashiva

00:05:32.628 --> 00:05:39.582
where there is bliss, there is forgiveness, there’s joy.

00:05:41.773 --> 00:05:50.016
All this is only possible if you have seeking,

00:05:50.217 --> 00:06:00.769
that you have also a innate desire to be there.

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:11.977
This desire within us is reflected as the reflection of the Primordial Mother.
