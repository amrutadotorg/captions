00:00:02.889 --> 00:01:00.600
Today, we are doing a special type of puja

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:18.610
which is performed in the glory of Ekadesha
Rudra.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:35.980
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of
the Spirit.

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:51.590
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.000
He forgives, because we are human beings,
we commit mistakes,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.750
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.539
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives
us.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:25.620
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity,

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.870
we do immoral things,

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:46.970
we do thieving, and we do things that
are against God,

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.110
talk against Him.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:03:10.970
He also forgives our superficialities, jealousies,
our lust, our anger.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:28.760
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:34.409
vanities and also possessiveness.

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:38.519
He forgives our egoistical behaviour

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:43.180
and also our subordination to wrong things.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:52.450
But every action has a reaction,

00:03:52.450 --> 00:04:08.420
and when He forgives, He thinks that He has
given you a big grace-mark,

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:15.190
and that reaction builds up within Him

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:23.380
as a wrath, against those who are forgiven,

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:34.560
try to do greater mistakes.

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:49.480
Specially, after realisation,

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:52.830
because such a big blessing there is of the
realisation,

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:00.480
you’ve got the light and, in the light,
if you are holding onto a snake

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:09.000
then His wrath goes up because he sees how
stupid you have been.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:24.900
What I am saying is that after realisation,
specially, He is much more sensitive

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:31.710
that, people who are forgiven and have been
given such a big thing

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:34.420
like Self-realisation, still they do wrong
things

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.360
then he is much more wrathful.

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.820
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts
reducing and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:46.670
But when He forgives and, as a result of that
forgiveness

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:51.000
you feel the gratitude, then His blessings
start flowing towards you.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.130
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive
others.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.130
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust,
He pacifies your greed.

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:55.130
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come
on our being and

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:56.900
we become really beautiful flowers,

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:00.610
and we start shining in the sunshine of His
blessings.

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:05.310
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:09.500
to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:17.160
He protects realised souls at every point,
in every way.

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:23.850
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:30.720
but they are all neutralised by His tremendous
power of protection.

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:37.870
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided
into right path.

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:45.260
All the beautiful blessings of His are described
in the Psalm 23

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:47.250
isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.970
The Lord is my Shepherd”

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:55.340
Is all described how he looks after you as
a shepherd.

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.374
But He does not look after the evil people
He destroys them.

00:07:00.374 --> 00:07:06.190
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are
still carrying on with their evil nature

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.680
are destroyed.

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:18.080
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate
and do not rise He destroys,

00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:26.850
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:39.960
Those who murmur against God and live in a
way

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:50.580
that is not behoving a sahaja yogi, He removes
them from [it].

00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:57.890
So by one force, He protects, by another force,
He throws away.

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:11.010
But His destructive forces when they are built
up too much, then we call it :

00:08:11.010 --> 00:08:18.250
"Now the Ekadesha Rudra is active."

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:26.240
Now, this Ekadesha Rudra will be expressed

00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:29.310
when the Kalki itself will start acting,

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:35.470
means the destructive power which will destroy
all

00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.430
that is negative on this earth and save all
that is positive.

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:44.090
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis

00:08:44.090 --> 00:08:46.240
to expedite their ascent,

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.610
not to be satisfied with the social life or
married life

00:08:51.610 --> 00:08:57.440
or with all the blessings that God has bestowed
upon you.

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:02.420
We always see, what God has done for us,

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:10.400
how He has been miraculous to us, but we have
to see what we have done to ourselves,

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:23.640
what are
we doing about our own ascent and growth.

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:26.870
Now the…out of the eleven centres……

00:09:26.870 --> 00:09:28.970
Ekadesha, means eleven,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:40.080
the five come from the right side of your
void,

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.890
and five from the left side of your void.

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:53.030
The first five on the left hand side come
from:

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:59.280
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus,

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:03.880
or if you have read wrong books,

00:10:03.880 --> 00:10:12.340
or if you have been in the company of wrong
people,

00:10:12.340 --> 00:10:23.760
or if you have been sympathetic towards people
who have been following wrong paths,

00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:30.900
or you have been yourself one of the agents
or guru of these wrong people.

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:37.050
Now these five problems can be solved, if
we completely give up

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:40.120
whatever wrong we have been doing.

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:46.670
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to
beat the Shaitan, means the Satan,

00:10:46.670 --> 00:10:47.670
with shoes;

00:10:47.670 --> 00:10:48.800
but that has to be done not mechanically but
from your heart.

00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.890
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will
tell me,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:11:01.790
“My father is following this guru; that
father is following that guru,”

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:07.280
and get involved with their father, sister,
this, that

00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:12.430
and try to take them out from those gurus,
also get entangled.

00:11:12.430 --> 00:11:15.910
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

00:11:15.910 --> 00:11:19.670
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:27.030
and her parents and parents-in-law said that
the child must be baptised,

00:11:27.030 --> 00:11:31.220
and I told her, you cannot get this child
baptised

00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.860
because it’s a realised soul.

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:40.310
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,
and she took the child for baptism

00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:49.370
and the child became very funny – it was
really like a mad child.

00:11:49.370 --> 00:11:57.279
Now then she gave up all that and so she has
saved.

00:11:57.279 --> 00:12:04.620
But supposing she had another child and she
would have done the same thing,

00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:11.220
the second child would have been something
very, very bad.

00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:15.360
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:19.930
that anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme

00:12:19.930 --> 00:12:25.800
thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:28.340
Either you should have very strong sensitivity,

00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:32.450
or you should feel it in your body,

00:12:32.450 --> 00:12:40.180
or with your intelligence you should understand
what is Sahaja Yoga.

00:12:40.180 --> 00:12:47.710
A person who is still negative always gets
attracted towards other one

00:12:47.710 --> 00:12:51.480
who is a very,very powerfully negative

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:57.960
and does not understand that the other person
is so powerfully negative,

00:12:57.960 --> 00:12:59.600
but gets impressed.

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:04.480
Under such circumstances, such a person is
hit by that negative person

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:06.380
and Shiva cannot protect.

00:13:06.380 --> 00:13:12.750
One should not have sympathy with anyone who
is negative,

00:13:12.750 --> 00:13:18.680
whether he is mad, whether there is something
wrong with him,

00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:21.110
whether he is your relation, or anything.

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.390
No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a
kind of a anger

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.700
should be there for that person,

00:13:25.700 --> 00:13:30.029
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

00:13:30.029 --> 00:13:35.840
And this angry detachment is the only time

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:39.640
when you have to be angry.

00:13:39.640 --> 00:13:46.660
But I have seen people who have anger for
very good sahaja yogis

00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:53.880
but not for their own husbands or wives who
are extremely negative.

00:13:53.880 --> 00:13:58.340
So when the Ekadesha Rudra starts acting on
these five sides

00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:04.310
on the, we should say, on the right side it
moves,

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:10.840
because it comes from the left and moves to
the right side,

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:19.540
then a person starts becoming negative but
acting with his ego.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:28.190
Such a person may take up a situation into
hands and say that

00:14:28.190 --> 00:14:37.300
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am
so, we should do like this

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:42.120
and we should behave like this”, and start
dictating people.

00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.500
[They] can do anything.

00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:46.590
And some mediocres or some half baked sahaja
yogis

00:14:46.590 --> 00:14:48.319
may try to understand [him],

00:14:48.319 --> 00:14:52.250
but most will know that “This fellow is
going out,

00:14:52.250 --> 00:14:56.190
now he’s on his way out!”

00:14:56.190 --> 00:15:02.760
So, all these things lead to this left side
development,

00:15:02.760 --> 00:15:10.140
or we can call it on the head, on the right
hand side of your medha,

00:15:10.140 --> 00:15:11.770
this plate, brain-plate

00:15:11.770 --> 00:15:14.420
is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:20.550
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea
people have that,

00:15:20.550 --> 00:15:25.290
“I am myself a big guru.”

00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:32.399
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also,
as if

00:15:32.399 --> 00:15:36.360
they have become great gurus.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:41.290
We have known some people who give big lectures

00:15:41.290 --> 00:15:44.990
in any programme and never allow

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:49.310
my tape to be played or anything.

00:15:49.310 --> 00:15:53.640
They think they have now become experts.

00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:59.890
Then some of them say that now we have become
so great

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:05.839
that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

00:16:05.839 --> 00:16:14.110
there’s no need to do meditation – there
are some like that also.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:16.670
And then there are some who say

00:16:16.670 --> 00:16:24.090
that "sin can never touch us, now we are sahaja
yogis,

00:16:24.090 --> 00:16:28.700
we are very great evolved souls".

00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:42.680
But the worst of all are those who just take
my name

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:49.839
saying that “Mother has said so and I am
telling you because Mother has said”

00:16:49.839 --> 00:16:54.450
– when I have never said such a thing, is
all falsehood.

00:16:54.450 --> 00:16:58.970
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga
money

00:16:58.970 --> 00:17:06.390
and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way, exploit
them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:11.780
And such people become very inauspicious.

00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:18.790
Anyone who tries such things will go out of
Sahaja Yoga

00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:19.790
with disgrace.

00:17:19.790 --> 00:17:24.120
But one should never go near such a person,

00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.940
have nothing to do with such a person, have
no sympathies.

00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:34.260
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone
to any extent,

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:38.390
so better keep out of such people.

00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.150
When these ten Ekadeshas are developed within
a person,

00:17:43.150 --> 00:17:47.940
then definitely such a person gets diseases
like cancer

00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:50.060
and incurable horrible diseases.

00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:54.460
Specially, when the eleventh one which is
actually here,

00:17:54.460 --> 00:17:56.900
which is the Viraatas chakra,

00:17:56.900 --> 00:17:58.920
which is the collectivity,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:02.210
when it is affected as well, then such a person
cannot get out of this disease.

00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:04.950
But these…out of these even five are combined,

00:18:04.950 --> 00:18:08.300
supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.440
then they get into very serious type of dirty
diseases.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:21.210
That’s why, I always say that be careful
about your Agnya chakra,

00:18:21.210 --> 00:18:27.080
because that is one of the worst things,

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:35.270
that, once it starts getting combined with
these Ekadeshas, part of the Ekadeshas,

00:18:35.270 --> 00:18:40.330
then anything can happen to a person,

00:18:40.330 --> 00:18:44.280
he can meet with a horrible accident,

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:50.590
he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be
murdered by someone,

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:56.309
anything can happen to such a person who has
got the right Agnya

00:18:56.309 --> 00:19:02.620
and also any one of the Ekadeshas, right or
left.

00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:19.610
That means, the five of these, if they, any
one of the five,

00:19:19.610 --> 00:19:21.710
if they combine with Agnya Chakra,

00:19:21.710 --> 00:19:23.530
the protective powers of God are minimum.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:26.510
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:28.640
say now I am speaking,

00:19:28.640 --> 00:19:30.680
now you should watch Me constantly,

00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:37.036
so that there is thoughtless awareness and
the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

00:19:37.036 --> 00:19:38.060
But, don’t pay attention here and there
all the time.

00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.780
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention
will neutralise

00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:45.630
into thoughtless awareness,

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:52.020
and your attention would be fixed in such
a manner

00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:56.620
that you don’t have to worry about anything.

00:19:56.620 --> 00:20:00.520
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch
you,

00:20:00.520 --> 00:20:02.750
that is your fortress.

00:20:02.750 --> 00:20:06.650
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless
awareness,

00:20:06.650 --> 00:20:13.799
that is the sign that you are rising higher.

00:20:13.799 --> 00:20:21.360
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright,
Mother we are doing.”

00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:24.790
Mechanically, they do and say,

00:20:24.790 --> 00:20:30.630
“I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

00:20:30.630 --> 00:20:35.990
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness,
minimum of minimum?

00:20:35.990 --> 00:20:43.380
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out
of your head?

00:20:43.380 --> 00:20:47.520
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically,

00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.549
it is not going to help; help you or help
anyone.

00:20:48.549 --> 00:20:51.830
So, after realisation, as you are very well
protected,

00:20:51.830 --> 00:20:55.840
you have all the blessings and a great future,

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:59.530
you also have a great possibility of a complete
annihilation.

00:20:59.530 --> 00:21:03.780
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing,

00:21:03.780 --> 00:21:07.480
and everybody is supporting you to climb,
holding your hand,

00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:14.840
and there are so many things by which you
are protected, to be taken upward,

00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:20.460
there’s no possibility of falling off by
mistake also,

00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:29.460
but if you try to remove your bondages with
Truth and Love

00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.260
and all the time try to hit the people who
are trying to support you,

00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.510
then you fall from a great height, greater
height.

00:21:35.510 --> 00:21:39.710
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater
you fall,

00:21:39.710 --> 00:21:44.250
and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

00:21:44.250 --> 00:21:54.080
But every effort is made by the Divine, every
support is given to you,

00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.570
every care is taken.

00:21:56.570 --> 00:22:00.200
Despite that, if you want to fall,

00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.950
then from that height, is very dangerous.

00:22:02.950 --> 00:22:08.070
But Ekadesha Rudra, at that time, at such
a time when somebody tries

00:22:08.070 --> 00:22:11.760
to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:15.080
after being in Sahaja Yoga,

00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:18.970
then hits you so badly

00:22:18.970 --> 00:22:23.650
that the whole attack is very widespread.

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:33.730
But the whole family can be protected if there
are few people of that family

00:22:33.730 --> 00:22:38.559
doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

00:22:38.559 --> 00:22:47.690
But in case the family that is against all
the time of sahaja yogis

00:22:47.690 --> 00:22:49.620
and try to trouble them,

00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:55.370
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad
way.

00:22:55.370 --> 00:23:06.830
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of, as
I told you, from the Void.

00:23:06.830 --> 00:23:17.120
So, we can say that the destruction part of
it comes from the Void mainly.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.870
But these are the powers, all are given in
one person

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:26.710
that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus
Christ.

00:23:26.710 --> 00:23:30.080
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.200
He’s the personification of Omkara,

00:23:32.200 --> 00:23:34.180
he’s the Personification of vibrations.

00:23:34.180 --> 00:23:39.700
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe
starts breaking.

00:23:39.700 --> 00:23:42.929
As He personifies the power of the Mother

00:23:42.929 --> 00:23:50.179
which is penetrating into every atom, into
every molecule, and to every human being,

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:53.710
into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

00:23:53.710 --> 00:24:01.950
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets
into a jeopardy.

00:24:01.950 --> 00:24:06.170
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:11.700
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like
small children”

00:24:11.700 --> 00:24:24.190
That is, the innocence, the purity of the
heart is the best way you can please Him.

00:24:24.190 --> 00:24:33.940
As in the West, specially, people have developed
their brains too much,

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:39.640
they try to play about with words

00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:46.950
and think that nobody knows what they are
doing.

00:24:46.950 --> 00:24:57.000
All such people must know that everything
you do is known to God.

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:59.710
If you are not clean in heart,

00:24:59.710 --> 00:25:02.290
it is very dangerous for anybody to pose

00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:06.160
as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:14.570
Such people are not possessed, nor they are
conditioned, nor they are egoistical,

00:25:14.570 --> 00:25:27.290
but they are very cunning clever people and
they are quite aware, as to what they are

00:25:27.290 --> 00:25:28.290
doing.

00:25:28.290 --> 00:25:32.220
But, there are people who get possessed also

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:35.520
and then they, in that , they try to destroy
themselves

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.250
or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:56.200
There are some who think that if they hurt
themselves or do some sort of an extreme thing

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.560
then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:06.250
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

00:26:06.250 --> 00:26:12.170
then you should know that something is wrong
with you.

00:26:12.170 --> 00:26:15.640
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:22.049
then you must know that there’s something
definitely wrong with you.

00:26:22.049 --> 00:26:29.130
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja
yogis,

00:26:29.130 --> 00:26:31.300
then it’s sure something is wrong with you.

00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.270
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness
of God,

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:38.420
then something wrong with you.

00:26:38.420 --> 00:26:47.140
If you are still worried about negative people
and their problems

00:26:47.140 --> 00:26:50.110
then know that there’s something wrong with
you.

00:26:50.110 --> 00:27:00.870
If you have sympathies with negative people,
then also there’s something wrong with you.

00:27:00.870 --> 00:27:03.240
But if you have anger for negative and all
that is negative

00:27:03.240 --> 00:27:05.290
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are
there.

00:27:05.290 --> 00:27:10.580
When this thing gets matured then you become
the power

00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.190
of Ekadesha Rudra yourself.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:14.679
Anybody who will try to insult you

00:27:14.679 --> 00:27:18.760
or to do any harm, will collapse.

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:25.789
It has happened with many people who tried
to be insulting to Me

00:27:25.789 --> 00:27:29.809
or tried to harm Me or anyway….

00:27:29.809 --> 00:27:33.830
Sometimes I am quite worried about them.

00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:41.000
So one has to be in such a way that they become
the Ekadesha.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:43.500
Nobody can touch such people.

00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:45.920
But such a person is full of compassion and
forgiveness.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.450
As a result, Ekadesha acts much faster.

00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:48.450
The more compassionate you are the more powerful
Ekadesha becomes.

00:27:48.450 --> 00:27:51.679
The more collective you become, the more Ekadesha
acts.

00:27:51.679 --> 00:27:54.590
Many people have a habit of receding back
into their exclusion

00:27:54.590 --> 00:27:59.090
and saying “Oh we better be at home and
it’s alright,”

00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:02.630
but they don’t know what they are missing.

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.940
Whatever may be your experience with others,
you should stick-on together,

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:07.900
always attend programmes, take leadership,
go ahead with it,

00:28:07.900 --> 00:28:10.410
work it out and you will be blessed thousand-fold.

00:28:10.410 --> 00:28:13.660
Ekadesha Rudra are all the powers, I would
say, of destruction, together.

00:28:13.660 --> 00:28:18.549
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

00:28:18.549 --> 00:28:24.250
It is destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

00:28:24.250 --> 00:28:31.620
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.230
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:41.090
and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana,
Kartikeya and Ganesha.

00:28:41.090 --> 00:28:44.450
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:48.020
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations
are Ekadeshas.

00:28:48.020 --> 00:28:52.860
Now the last but not the least, is the destructive
power

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.750
of Hiranyagarbha which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

00:28:54.750 --> 00:28:58.640
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes,

00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.919
the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive
power.

00:29:01.919 --> 00:29:04.460
So, thus, the complete total destructive power
is Ekadesha Rudra.

00:29:04.460 --> 00:29:06.530
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but
it’s not blind.

00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:08.350
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately
woven.

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:12.730
It avoids all the good points and attacks
the wrong things

00:29:12.730 --> 00:29:16.030
and it hits at the right time, at the right
point,

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:20.059
direct, without hitting anything that is good
in between.

00:29:20.059 --> 00:29:24.150
Now the glance of Ekadesha Rudra falls upon
someone,

00:29:24.150 --> 00:29:32.250
say, for example, and there is something in
between which is divine or which is a positive

00:29:32.250 --> 00:29:33.250
thing

00:29:33.250 --> 00:29:41.059
[then] it penetrates through positive, without
harming the positive

00:29:41.059 --> 00:29:43.360
and hits the negative.

00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:47.650
It cools down somebody and burns another.

00:29:47.650 --> 00:29:52.080
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools
down.

00:29:52.080 --> 00:29:58.030
So that is how it works with such care and
such delicacy.

00:29:58.030 --> 00:30:01.290
And it is tremendously sharp also.

00:30:01.290 --> 00:30:03.460
And it’s very painful.

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:11.190
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot,

00:30:11.190 --> 00:30:13.140
it goes on slowly, slowly.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.049
All the horrible tortures that you have learnt

00:30:16.049 --> 00:30:21.020
or heard about are expressions of Ekadesha
only.

00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:25.110
For example, take the case of cancer.

00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:30.390
In the cancer thing, the nose is removed,
the tongues are removed, then the gullet is

00:30:30.390 --> 00:30:31.390
removed,

00:30:31.390 --> 00:30:36.300
then everything goes on, one after [another],
being removed with terrible pain, you see.

00:30:36.300 --> 00:30:42.770
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot
feel their fingers,

00:30:42.770 --> 00:30:49.660
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything
eats their fingers

00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:53.940
they can’t feel it, so they start losing
their fingers,

00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:57.809
that is how Ekadesha eats up people, devours.

00:30:57.809 --> 00:31:02.220
But this wrathfulness of the Father can be
very gentle and could be very sweet,

00:31:02.220 --> 00:31:03.220
when it comes to His own children.

00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:04.220
The story is about the Mother

00:31:04.220 --> 00:31:05.220
– once She got very angry, the Primordial
Mother.

00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:08.940
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy
the whole world with Her Ekadesha power

00:31:08.940 --> 00:31:12.700
and She tried to destroy the whole world.

00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:17.150
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself
felt that She is being

00:31:17.150 --> 00:31:19.280
[a] bit too much angry.

00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:24.870
So when She started destroying, and She was
going right and left,

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:36.490
He did not know what to do, so He took Her
child,

00:31:36.490 --> 00:31:46.690
that means representing sahaja yogi, you can
say, representing Christ

00:31:46.690 --> 00:31:58.409
or representing anyone of these great children
of Her’s, that he put the child

00:31:58.409 --> 00:32:00.520
under Her feet.

00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:03.039
So, when She was stamping,

00:32:03.039 --> 00:32:11.260
suddenly She saw Her own child under Her feet
and Her such a big tongue came out.

00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:12.710
She just stopped.

00:32:12.710 --> 00:32:13.710
Balancing.

00:32:13.710 --> 00:32:16.200
But this has happened only once.

00:32:16.200 --> 00:32:22.190
So, after the Ekadesha Rudra, ultimately the
complete destruction comes

00:32:22.190 --> 00:32:25.260
through the anger of Sadashiva.

00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:31.370
When the final total destruction takes place.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:41.140
So thus we have seen how Ekadesha Rudra acts

00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:45.190
and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves
Ekadesha Rudra.

00:32:45.190 --> 00:32:47.390
Now to develop this power

00:32:47.390 --> 00:32:51.350
one has to develop a tremendous power of detachment,

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:53.990
power of detachment, detachment from negative.

00:32:53.990 --> 00:32:57.960
For example, negativity can come from very
near people,

00:32:57.960 --> 00:33:03.240
like brother, mother, sister, could come from
friends, could come from relatives.

00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:11.309
It could come from a country, it could come
from your political ideas, economic ideas,

00:33:11.309 --> 00:33:13.620
anything like that.

00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:19.690
Any misidentification can destroy your power
of Ekadesha Rudra.

00:33:19.690 --> 00:33:33.429
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I
am surrendered to Sahaja Yoga

00:33:33.429 --> 00:33:37.260
and I am a sahaja yogi,”

00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.990
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja
Yoga.

00:33:40.990 --> 00:33:43.630
So that, intelligently, you understand what
is Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:51.410
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent

00:33:51.410 --> 00:33:58.080
and if the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter
into their intelligence

00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:02.110
you can never overcome your attachments.

00:34:02.110 --> 00:34:17.190
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about
Sahaja Yoga or you give lectures on that,

00:34:17.190 --> 00:34:23.970
but mentally you should also understand what
is Sahaja Yoga.

00:34:23.970 --> 00:34:30.049
Today is a special day when it has been asked
that

00:34:30.049 --> 00:34:34.289
we should have Ekadesha Rudra puja,

00:34:34.289 --> 00:34:41.359
and is for all kinds of false religious sects
and false gurus

00:34:41.359 --> 00:34:54.769
and false religions, which are followed in
the name of God,

00:34:54.769 --> 00:35:00.329
or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

00:35:00.329 --> 00:35:22.170
and does not achieve Self-realisation and
does not get connected with God, is false.

00:35:22.170 --> 00:35:26.569
So any such thing that is just faith and talks
of God

00:35:26.569 --> 00:35:29.619
but has no connection with God

00:35:29.619 --> 00:35:31.580
cannot be a true religion.

00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:35.400
Of course, it gives a balance to people,

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:43.400
but in giving that balance, if people live
on that money

00:35:43.400 --> 00:36:07.609
and try to enjoy a wealth out of that money,

00:36:07.609 --> 00:36:16.750
then it is not even at the very lower level
is religion.

00:36:16.750 --> 00:36:34.170
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to
give a balance to begin with,

00:36:34.170 --> 00:37:32.660
but in that balancing when
they tell, “You have to

00:37:32.660 --> 00:37:35.289
be balanced,

00:37:35.289 --> 00:37:49.980
but give me money for that,

00:37:49.980 --> 00:38:03.999
you must give me money, give me all your purse,
give me everything,”

00:38:03.999 --> 00:38:23.969
then that cannot be balanced, it does not
even have a slightest thing of the blessings

00:38:23.969 --> 00:38:31.960
of God.

00:38:31.960 --> 00:38:52.309
Or any religion that makes you bow to
anybody else but the incarnation,

00:38:52.309 --> 00:38:56.999
is no religion.

00:38:56.999 --> 00:39:19.519
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

00:39:19.519 --> 00:39:47.530
The real religion will give you a balance
and will always talk

00:39:47.530 --> 00:39:54.499
about the ascent.

00:39:54.499 --> 00:40:30.800
But they will not ask for money or make one
man something great as venerated.

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:36.910
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between
falsehood, negative things

00:40:36.910 --> 00:40:38.329
and real things.

00:40:38.329 --> 00:40:44.099
Once you develop that discrimination through
vibratory awareness,

00:40:44.099 --> 00:40:51.210
or through your intelligence, you are in the
control of yourself.

00:40:51.210 --> 00:42:12.049
And then

00:42:12.049 --> 00:43:29.890
you become that power

00:43:29.890 --> 00:43:40.279
of Ekadesha,

00:43:40.279 --> 00:44:08.440
when you establish your maturity.

00:44:08.440 --> 00:46:25.819
Today, I bless you all, that

00:46:25.819 --> 00:46:29.339
you all

00:46:29.339 --> 00:48:18.999
become the

00:48:18.999 --> 00:50:08.559
power of Ekadesha Rudra

00:50:08.559 --> 00:50:32.519
and

00:50:32.519 --> 00:50:47.690
you develop

00:50:47.690 --> 00:53:54.710
that sincerity which takes you to that state.

00:53:54.710 --> 00:59:41.359
May

00:59:41.359 --> 01:00:38.089
God

01:00:38.089 --> 01:03:49.509
Bless you.
