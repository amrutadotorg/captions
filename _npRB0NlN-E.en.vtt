WEBVTT

00:02.889 --> 01:00.600
Today, we are doing a special type of puja

01:00.600 --> 01:18.610
which is performed in the glory of Ekadesha
Rudra.

01:18.610 --> 01:35.980
Rudra is the destructive power of Shiva, of
the Spirit.

01:35.980 --> 01:51.590
Now one power, which is His nature, is forgiveness.

01:51.590 --> 01:56.000
He forgives, because we are human beings,
we commit mistakes,

01:56.000 --> 01:59.750
we do wrong things, we get tempted,

01:59.750 --> 02:08.539
our attention is disturbed – so he forgives
us.

02:08.539 --> 02:25.620
He also forgives us when we spoil our chastity,

02:25.620 --> 02:27.870
we do immoral things,

02:27.870 --> 02:46.970
we do thieving, and we do things that
are against God,

02:46.970 --> 02:51.110
talk against Him.

02:51.110 --> 03:10.970
He also forgives our superficialities, jealousies,
our lust, our anger.

03:10.970 --> 03:28.760
Also He forgives our attachments, petty jealousies,

03:28.760 --> 03:34.409
vanities and also possessiveness.

03:34.409 --> 03:38.519
He forgives our egoistical behaviour

03:38.519 --> 03:43.180
and also our subordination to wrong things.

03:43.180 --> 03:52.450
But every action has a reaction,

03:52.450 --> 04:08.420
and when He forgives, He thinks that He has
given you a big grace-mark,

04:08.420 --> 04:15.190
and that reaction builds up within Him

04:15.190 --> 04:23.380
as a wrath, against those who are forgiven,

04:23.380 --> 04:34.560
try to do greater mistakes.

04:34.560 --> 04:49.480
Specially, after realisation,

04:49.480 --> 04:52.830
because such a big blessing there is of the
realisation,

04:52.830 --> 05:00.480
you’ve got the light and, in the light,
if you are holding onto a snake

05:00.480 --> 05:09.000
then His wrath goes up because he sees how
stupid you have been.

05:09.000 --> 05:24.900
What I am saying is that after realisation,
specially, He is much more sensitive

05:24.900 --> 05:31.710
that, people who are forgiven and have been
given such a big thing

05:31.710 --> 05:34.420
like Self-realisation, still they do wrong
things

05:34.420 --> 05:38.360
then he is much more wrathful.

05:38.360 --> 05:44.820
So, in the balance, the forgiveness starts
reducing and the wrathfulness starts increasing.

05:44.820 --> 05:46.670
But when He forgives and, as a result of that
forgiveness

05:46.670 --> 05:51.000
you feel the gratitude, then His blessings
start flowing towards you.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.130
He gives you tremendous capacity to forgive
others.

05:53.130 --> 05:54.130
He pacifies your anger, He pacifies your lust,
He pacifies your greed.

05:54.130 --> 05:55.130
Like beautiful dew drop His blessings come
on our being and

05:55.130 --> 05:56.900
we become really beautiful flowers,

05:56.900 --> 06:00.610
and we start shining in the sunshine of His
blessings.

06:00.610 --> 06:05.310
Now He uses His wrath or His destructive power

06:05.310 --> 06:09.500
to destroy all that tries to trouble us.

06:09.500 --> 06:17.160
He protects realised souls at every point,
in every way.

06:17.160 --> 06:23.850
Negative forces try to attack a sahaja yogi

06:23.850 --> 06:30.720
but they are all neutralised by His tremendous
power of protection.

06:30.720 --> 06:37.870
Through his vibratory awareness we are guided
into right path.

06:37.870 --> 06:45.260
All the beautiful blessings of His are described
in the Psalm 23

06:45.260 --> 06:47.250
isn’t it, that’s the 23 Psalm ……

06:47.250 --> 06:48.970
The Lord is my Shepherd”

06:48.970 --> 06:55.340
Is all described how he looks after you as
a shepherd.

06:55.340 --> 07:00.374
But He does not look after the evil people
He destroys them.

07:00.374 --> 07:06.190
Those who enter into Sahaja Yoga [and] are
still carrying on with their evil nature

07:06.190 --> 07:07.680
are destroyed.

07:07.680 --> 07:18.080
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga and do not meditate
and do not rise He destroys,

07:18.080 --> 07:26.850
or they are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

07:26.850 --> 07:39.960
Those who murmur against God and live in a
way

07:39.960 --> 07:50.580
that is not behoving a sahaja yogi, He removes
them from [it].

07:50.580 --> 07:57.890
So by one force, He protects, by another force,
He throws away.

07:57.890 --> 08:11.010
But His destructive forces when they are built
up too much, then we call it :

08:11.010 --> 08:18.250
"Now the Ekadesha Rudra is active."

08:18.250 --> 08:26.240
Now, this Ekadesha Rudra will be expressed

08:26.240 --> 08:29.310
when the Kalki itself will start acting,

08:29.310 --> 08:35.470
means the destructive power which will destroy
all

08:35.470 --> 08:40.430
that is negative on this earth and save all
that is positive.

08:40.430 --> 08:44.090
So it is very necessary for sahaja yogis

08:44.090 --> 08:46.240
to expedite their ascent,

08:46.240 --> 08:51.610
not to be satisfied with the social life or
married life

08:51.610 --> 08:57.440
or with all the blessings that God has bestowed
upon you.

08:57.440 --> 09:02.420
We always see, what God has done for us,

09:02.420 --> 09:10.400
how He has been miraculous to us, but we have
to see what we have done to ourselves,

09:10.400 --> 09:23.640
what are
we doing about our own ascent and growth.

09:23.640 --> 09:26.870
Now the…out of the eleven centres……

09:26.870 --> 09:28.970
Ekadesha, means eleven,

09:28.970 --> 09:40.080
the five come from the right side of your
void,

09:40.080 --> 09:42.890
and five from the left side of your void.

09:42.890 --> 09:53.030
The first five on the left hand side come
from:

09:53.030 --> 09:59.280
if you have bowed yourself to wrong gurus,

09:59.280 --> 10:03.880
or if you have read wrong books,

10:03.880 --> 10:12.340
or if you have been in the company of wrong
people,

10:12.340 --> 10:23.760
or if you have been sympathetic towards people
who have been following wrong paths,

10:23.760 --> 10:30.900
or you have been yourself one of the agents
or guru of these wrong people.

10:30.900 --> 10:37.050
Now these five problems can be solved, if
we completely give up

10:37.050 --> 10:40.120
whatever wrong we have been doing.

10:40.120 --> 10:46.670
As Mohammed Sahib has said that you have to
beat the Shaitan, means the Satan,

10:46.670 --> 10:47.670
with shoes;

10:47.670 --> 10:48.800
but that has to be done not mechanically but
from your heart.

10:48.800 --> 10:51.890
Like many people who come to Sahaja Yoga will
tell me,

10:51.890 --> 11:01.790
“My father is following this guru; that
father is following that guru,”

11:01.790 --> 11:07.280
and get involved with their father, sister,
this, that

11:07.280 --> 11:12.430
and try to take them out from those gurus,
also get entangled.

11:12.430 --> 11:15.910
Or some of them yield to others’ forces.

11:15.910 --> 11:19.670
Like I know of Maureen, who was with me,

11:19.670 --> 11:27.030
and her parents and parents-in-law said that
the child must be baptised,

11:27.030 --> 11:31.220
and I told her, you cannot get this child
baptised

11:31.220 --> 11:32.860
because it’s a realised soul.

11:32.860 --> 11:40.310
But she could not, that way, stand up to that,
and she took the child for baptism

11:40.310 --> 11:49.370
and the child became very funny – it was
really like a mad child.

11:49.370 --> 11:57.279
Now then she gave up all that and so she has
saved.

11:57.279 --> 12:04.620
But supposing she had another child and she
would have done the same thing,

12:04.620 --> 12:11.220
the second child would have been something
very, very bad.

12:11.220 --> 12:15.360
Now, the trouble with sahaja yogis is

12:15.360 --> 12:19.930
that anybody who comes to Sahaja Yoga programme

12:19.930 --> 12:25.800
thinks he is a sahaja yogi – is not so.

12:25.800 --> 12:28.340
Either you should have very strong sensitivity,

12:28.340 --> 12:32.450
or you should feel it in your body,

12:32.450 --> 12:40.180
or with your intelligence you should understand
what is Sahaja Yoga.

12:40.180 --> 12:47.710
A person who is still negative always gets
attracted towards other one

12:47.710 --> 12:51.480
who is a very,very powerfully negative

12:51.480 --> 12:57.960
and does not understand that the other person
is so powerfully negative,

12:57.960 --> 12:59.600
but gets impressed.

12:59.600 --> 13:04.480
Under such circumstances, such a person is
hit by that negative person

13:04.480 --> 13:06.380
and Shiva cannot protect.

13:06.380 --> 13:12.750
One should not have sympathy with anyone who
is negative,

13:12.750 --> 13:18.680
whether he is mad, whether there is something
wrong with him,

13:18.680 --> 13:21.110
whether he is your relation, or anything.

13:21.110 --> 13:23.390
No sympathy of any kind, on the contrary a
kind of a anger

13:23.390 --> 13:25.700
should be there for that person,

13:25.700 --> 13:30.029
a kind of a detachment, angry detachment.

13:30.029 --> 13:35.840
And this angry detachment is the only time

13:35.840 --> 13:39.640
when you have to be angry.

13:39.640 --> 13:46.660
But I have seen people who have anger for
very good sahaja yogis

13:46.660 --> 13:53.880
but not for their own husbands or wives who
are extremely negative.

13:53.880 --> 13:58.340
So when the Ekadesha Rudra starts acting on
these five sides

13:58.340 --> 14:04.310
on the, we should say, on the right side it
moves,

14:04.310 --> 14:10.840
because it comes from the left and moves to
the right side,

14:10.840 --> 14:19.540
then a person starts becoming negative but
acting with his ego.

14:19.540 --> 14:28.190
Such a person may take up a situation into
hands and say that

14:28.190 --> 14:37.300
“I am such and such sahaja yogi and I am
so, we should do like this

14:37.300 --> 14:42.120
and we should behave like this”, and start
dictating people.

14:42.120 --> 14:43.500
[They] can do anything.

14:43.500 --> 14:46.590
And some mediocres or some half baked sahaja
yogis

14:46.590 --> 14:48.319
may try to understand [him],

14:48.319 --> 14:52.250
but most will know that “This fellow is
going out,

14:52.250 --> 14:56.190
now he’s on his way out!”

14:56.190 --> 15:02.760
So, all these things lead to this left side
development,

15:02.760 --> 15:10.140
or we can call it on the head, on the right
hand side of your medha,

15:10.140 --> 15:11.770
this plate, brain-plate

15:11.770 --> 15:14.420
is called as medha in Sanskrit language.

15:14.420 --> 15:20.550
Now, the right sided one, comes from the idea
people have that,

15:20.550 --> 15:25.290
“I am myself a big guru.”

15:25.290 --> 15:32.399
They start preaching about Sahaja Yoga also,
as if

15:32.399 --> 15:36.360
they have become great gurus.

15:36.360 --> 15:41.290
We have known some people who give big lectures

15:41.290 --> 15:44.990
in any programme and never allow

15:44.990 --> 15:49.310
my tape to be played or anything.

15:49.310 --> 15:53.640
They think they have now become experts.

15:53.640 --> 15:59.890
Then some of them say that now we have become
so great

15:59.890 --> 16:05.839
that we need not do any footsoaking or anything,

16:05.839 --> 16:14.110
there’s no need to do meditation – there
are some like that also.

16:14.110 --> 16:16.670
And then there are some who say

16:16.670 --> 16:24.090
that "sin can never touch us, now we are sahaja
yogis,

16:24.090 --> 16:28.700
we are very great evolved souls".

16:28.700 --> 16:42.680
But the worst of all are those who just take
my name

16:42.680 --> 16:49.839
saying that “Mother has said so and I am
telling you because Mother has said”

16:49.839 --> 16:54.450
– when I have never said such a thing, is
all falsehood.

16:54.450 --> 16:58.970
Now there are some people who use Sahaja Yoga
money

16:58.970 --> 17:06.390
and exploit Sahaja Yoga in such a way, exploit
them, sahaja yogis also sometimes.

17:06.390 --> 17:11.780
And such people become very inauspicious.

17:11.780 --> 17:18.790
Anyone who tries such things will go out of
Sahaja Yoga

17:18.790 --> 17:19.790
with disgrace.

17:19.790 --> 17:24.120
But one should never go near such a person,

17:24.120 --> 17:28.940
have nothing to do with such a person, have
no sympathies.

17:28.940 --> 17:34.260
Because this inauspiciousness will hurt anyone
to any extent,

17:34.260 --> 17:38.390
so better keep out of such people.

17:38.390 --> 17:43.150
When these ten Ekadeshas are developed within
a person,

17:43.150 --> 17:47.940
then definitely such a person gets diseases
like cancer

17:47.940 --> 17:50.060
and incurable horrible diseases.

17:50.060 --> 17:54.460
Specially, when the eleventh one which is
actually here,

17:54.460 --> 17:56.900
which is the Viraatas chakra,

17:56.900 --> 17:58.920
which is the collectivity,

17:58.920 --> 18:02.210
when it is affected as well, then such a person
cannot get out of this disease.

18:02.210 --> 18:04.950
But these…out of these even five are combined,

18:04.950 --> 18:08.300
supposing, with Mooladhara or with Agnya,

18:08.300 --> 18:13.440
then they get into very serious type of dirty
diseases.

18:13.440 --> 18:21.210
That’s why, I always say that be careful
about your Agnya chakra,

18:21.210 --> 18:27.080
because that is one of the worst things,

18:27.080 --> 18:35.270
that, once it starts getting combined with
these Ekadeshas, part of the Ekadeshas,

18:35.270 --> 18:40.330
then anything can happen to a person,

18:40.330 --> 18:44.280
he can meet with a horrible accident,

18:44.280 --> 18:50.590
he can suddenly be hit by someone, could be
murdered by someone,

18:50.590 --> 18:56.309
anything can happen to such a person who has
got the right Agnya

18:56.309 --> 19:02.620
and also any one of the Ekadeshas, right or
left.

19:02.620 --> 19:19.610
That means, the five of these, if they, any
one of the five,

19:19.610 --> 19:21.710
if they combine with Agnya Chakra,

19:21.710 --> 19:23.530
the protective powers of God are minimum.

19:23.530 --> 19:26.510
So, to keep your Agnya chakra alright,

19:26.510 --> 19:28.640
say now I am speaking,

19:28.640 --> 19:30.680
now you should watch Me constantly,

19:30.680 --> 19:37.036
so that there is thoughtless awareness and
the Agnya chakra is soothed out.

19:37.036 --> 19:38.060
But, don’t pay attention here and there
all the time.

19:38.060 --> 19:43.780
Then you will find that, gradually, your attention
will neutralise

19:43.780 --> 19:45.630
into thoughtless awareness,

19:45.630 --> 19:52.020
and your attention would be fixed in such
a manner

19:52.020 --> 19:56.620
that you don’t have to worry about anything.

19:56.620 --> 20:00.520
In thoughtless awareness nobody can touch
you,

20:00.520 --> 20:02.750
that is your fortress.

20:02.750 --> 20:06.650
By meditation, one must establish thoughtless
awareness,

20:06.650 --> 20:13.799
that is the sign that you are rising higher.

20:13.799 --> 20:21.360
Many people do meditation and say, “Alright,
Mother we are doing.”

20:21.360 --> 20:24.790
Mechanically, they do and say,

20:24.790 --> 20:30.630
“I did this, I did this, and I did this!”

20:30.630 --> 20:35.990
But did you achieve your thoughtless awareness,
minimum of minimum?

20:35.990 --> 20:43.380
Have you felt your cool breeze coming out
of your head?

20:43.380 --> 20:47.520
Otherwise, if you are doing something mechanically,

20:47.520 --> 20:48.549
it is not going to help; help you or help
anyone.

20:48.549 --> 20:51.830
So, after realisation, as you are very well
protected,

20:51.830 --> 20:55.840
you have all the blessings and a great future,

20:55.840 --> 20:59.530
you also have a great possibility of a complete
annihilation.

20:59.530 --> 21:03.780
I would say, to give an analogy, you are climbing,

21:03.780 --> 21:07.480
and everybody is supporting you to climb,
holding your hand,

21:07.480 --> 21:14.840
and there are so many things by which you
are protected, to be taken upward,

21:14.840 --> 21:20.460
there’s no possibility of falling off by
mistake also,

21:20.460 --> 21:29.460
but if you try to remove your bondages with
Truth and Love

21:29.460 --> 21:34.260
and all the time try to hit the people who
are trying to support you,

21:34.260 --> 21:35.510
then you fall from a great height, greater
height.

21:35.510 --> 21:39.710
I mean, the greater height you rise, the greater
you fall,

21:39.710 --> 21:44.250
and with a greater force also, much more deeper.

21:44.250 --> 21:54.080
But every effort is made by the Divine, every
support is given to you,

21:54.080 --> 21:56.570
every care is taken.

21:56.570 --> 22:00.200
Despite that, if you want to fall,

22:00.200 --> 22:02.950
then from that height, is very dangerous.

22:02.950 --> 22:08.070
But Ekadesha Rudra, at that time, at such
a time when somebody tries

22:08.070 --> 22:11.760
to harm the cause of Sahaja Yoga,

22:11.760 --> 22:15.080
after being in Sahaja Yoga,

22:15.080 --> 22:18.970
then hits you so badly

22:18.970 --> 22:23.650
that the whole attack is very widespread.

22:23.650 --> 22:33.730
But the whole family can be protected if there
are few people of that family

22:33.730 --> 22:38.559
doing Sahaja Yoga work; could be protected.

22:38.559 --> 22:47.690
But in case the family that is against all
the time of sahaja yogis

22:47.690 --> 22:49.620
and try to trouble them,

22:49.620 --> 22:55.370
can be completely destroyed, in a very bad
way.

22:55.370 --> 23:06.830
Now these Ekadesha Rudras come out of, as
I told you, from the Void.

23:06.830 --> 23:17.120
So, we can say that the destruction part of
it comes from the Void mainly.

23:17.120 --> 23:23.870
But these are the powers, all are given in
one person

23:23.870 --> 23:26.710
that is the Mahavishnu, that is Lord Jesus
Christ.

23:26.710 --> 23:30.080
Because He’s the support of the whole Universe,

23:30.080 --> 23:32.200
He’s the personification of Omkara,

23:32.200 --> 23:34.180
he’s the Personification of vibrations.

23:34.180 --> 23:39.700
So when He gets angry then the whole Universe
starts breaking.

23:39.700 --> 23:42.929
As He personifies the power of the Mother

23:42.929 --> 23:50.179
which is penetrating into every atom, into
every molecule, and to every human being,

23:50.179 --> 23:53.710
into every [thing] that is living and non-living:

23:53.710 --> 24:01.950
once it gets disturbed the whole thing gets
into a jeopardy.

24:01.950 --> 24:06.170
So the pleasing of Christ is very important.

24:06.170 --> 24:11.700
Now Christ has said, “You have to be like
small children”

24:11.700 --> 24:24.190
That is, the innocence, the purity of the
heart is the best way you can please Him.

24:24.190 --> 24:33.940
As in the West, specially, people have developed
their brains too much,

24:33.940 --> 24:39.640
they try to play about with words

24:39.640 --> 24:46.950
and think that nobody knows what they are
doing.

24:46.950 --> 24:57.000
All such people must know that everything
you do is known to God.

24:57.000 --> 24:59.710
If you are not clean in heart,

24:59.710 --> 25:02.290
it is very dangerous for anybody to pose

25:02.290 --> 25:06.160
as if he’s a very good sahaja yogi.

25:06.160 --> 25:14.570
Such people are not possessed, nor they are
conditioned, nor they are egoistical,

25:14.570 --> 25:27.290
but they are very cunning clever people and
they are quite aware, as to what they are

25:27.290 --> 25:28.290
doing.

25:28.290 --> 25:32.220
But, there are people who get possessed also

25:32.220 --> 25:35.520
and then they, in that , they try to destroy
themselves

25:35.520 --> 25:39.250
or cry and weep and do all kinds of things.

25:39.250 --> 25:56.200
There are some who think that if they hurt
themselves or do some sort of an extreme thing

25:56.200 --> 26:01.560
then God will be happy -are sadly mistaken.

26:01.560 --> 26:06.250
If you cannot enjoy in Sahaja Yoga,

26:06.250 --> 26:12.170
then you should know that something is wrong
with you.

26:12.170 --> 26:15.640
If you cannot feel happy in Sahaja Yoga

26:15.640 --> 26:22.049
then you must know that there’s something
definitely wrong with you.

26:22.049 --> 26:29.130
If you cannot enjoy the company of sahaja
yogis,

26:29.130 --> 26:31.300
then it’s sure something is wrong with you.

26:31.300 --> 26:35.270
If you cannot laugh and appreciate the greatness
of God,

26:35.270 --> 26:38.420
then something wrong with you.

26:38.420 --> 26:47.140
If you are still worried about negative people
and their problems

26:47.140 --> 26:50.110
then know that there’s something wrong with
you.

26:50.110 --> 27:00.870
If you have sympathies with negative people,
then also there’s something wrong with you.

27:00.870 --> 27:03.240
But if you have anger for negative and all
that is negative

27:03.240 --> 27:05.290
that is against Sahaja Yoga, then you are
there.

27:05.290 --> 27:10.580
When this thing gets matured then you become
the power

27:10.580 --> 27:12.190
of Ekadesha Rudra yourself.

27:12.190 --> 27:14.679
Anybody who will try to insult you

27:14.679 --> 27:18.760
or to do any harm, will collapse.

27:18.760 --> 27:25.789
It has happened with many people who tried
to be insulting to Me

27:25.789 --> 27:29.809
or tried to harm Me or anyway….

27:29.809 --> 27:33.830
Sometimes I am quite worried about them.

27:33.830 --> 27:41.000
So one has to be in such a way that they become
the Ekadesha.

27:41.000 --> 27:43.500
Nobody can touch such people.

27:43.500 --> 27:45.920
But such a person is full of compassion and
forgiveness.

27:45.920 --> 27:47.450
As a result, Ekadesha acts much faster.

27:47.450 --> 27:48.450
The more compassionate you are the more powerful
Ekadesha becomes.

27:48.450 --> 27:51.679
The more collective you become, the more Ekadesha
acts.

27:51.679 --> 27:54.590
Many people have a habit of receding back
into their exclusion

27:54.590 --> 27:59.090
and saying “Oh we better be at home and
it’s alright,”

27:59.090 --> 28:02.630
but they don’t know what they are missing.

28:02.630 --> 28:05.940
Whatever may be your experience with others,
you should stick-on together,

28:05.940 --> 28:07.900
always attend programmes, take leadership,
go ahead with it,

28:07.900 --> 28:10.410
work it out and you will be blessed thousand-fold.

28:10.410 --> 28:13.660
Ekadesha Rudra are all the powers, I would
say, of destruction, together.

28:13.660 --> 28:18.549
Is the power, destructive power of Shri Ganesha.

28:18.549 --> 28:24.250
It is destructive power of Brahma, Vishnu,
Mahesha.

28:24.250 --> 28:31.620
It is the destructive power of the Mother.

28:31.620 --> 28:34.230
Is the destructive power of the Ganesha…

28:34.230 --> 28:41.090
and four of these are Bhairava and Hanumana,
Kartikeya and Ganesha.

28:41.090 --> 28:44.450
Also the powers of Sadashiva and of the Adishakti.

28:44.450 --> 28:48.020
All the destructive powers of all the incarnations
are Ekadeshas.

28:48.020 --> 28:52.860
Now the last but not the least, is the destructive
power

28:52.860 --> 28:54.750
of Hiranyagarbha which is the Collective Brahmadeva.

28:54.750 --> 28:58.640
And this power when it acts, every atom explodes,

28:58.640 --> 29:01.919
the whole atomic energy goes into a destructive
power.

29:01.919 --> 29:04.460
So, thus, the complete total destructive power
is Ekadesha Rudra.

29:04.460 --> 29:06.530
It’s extremely powerful, explosive, but
it’s not blind.

29:06.530 --> 29:08.350
It’s very discriminative and extremely delicately
woven.

29:08.350 --> 29:12.730
It avoids all the good points and attacks
the wrong things

29:12.730 --> 29:16.030
and it hits at the right time, at the right
point,

29:16.030 --> 29:20.059
direct, without hitting anything that is good
in between.

29:20.059 --> 29:24.150
Now the glance of Ekadesha Rudra falls upon
someone,

29:24.150 --> 29:32.250
say, for example, and there is something in
between which is divine or which is a positive

29:32.250 --> 29:33.250
thing

29:33.250 --> 29:41.059
[then] it penetrates through positive, without
harming the positive

29:41.059 --> 29:43.360
and hits the negative.

29:43.360 --> 29:47.650
It cools down somebody and burns another.

29:47.650 --> 29:52.080
Not freezing, it doesn’t freeze, it cools
down.

29:52.080 --> 29:58.030
So that is how it works with such care and
such delicacy.

29:58.030 --> 30:01.290
And it is tremendously sharp also.

30:01.290 --> 30:03.460
And it’s very painful.

30:03.460 --> 30:11.190
It’s not like cutting the neck in one shot,

30:11.190 --> 30:13.140
it goes on slowly, slowly.

30:13.140 --> 30:16.049
All the horrible tortures that you have learnt

30:16.049 --> 30:21.020
or heard about are expressions of Ekadesha
only.

30:21.020 --> 30:25.110
For example, take the case of cancer.

30:25.110 --> 30:30.390
In the cancer thing, the nose is removed,
the tongues are removed, then the gullet is

30:30.390 --> 30:31.390
removed,

30:31.390 --> 30:36.300
then everything goes on, one after [another],
being removed with terrible pain, you see.

30:36.300 --> 30:42.770
Take leprosy for example, the lepers cannot
feel their fingers,

30:42.770 --> 30:49.660
they cannot feel it, so the…any rat or anything
eats their fingers

30:49.660 --> 30:53.940
they can’t feel it, so they start losing
their fingers,

30:53.940 --> 30:57.809
that is how Ekadesha eats up people, devours.

30:57.809 --> 31:02.220
But this wrathfulness of the Father can be
very gentle and could be very sweet,

31:02.220 --> 31:03.220
when it comes to His own children.

31:03.220 --> 31:04.220
The story is about the Mother

31:04.220 --> 31:05.220
– once She got very angry, the Primordial
Mother.

31:05.220 --> 31:08.940
And She was so angry, She wanted to destroy
the whole world with Her Ekadesha power

31:08.940 --> 31:12.700
and She tried to destroy the whole world.

31:12.700 --> 31:17.150
When She went into that mood, the Father Himself
felt that She is being

31:17.150 --> 31:19.280
[a] bit too much angry.

31:19.280 --> 31:24.870
So when She started destroying, and She was
going right and left,

31:24.870 --> 31:36.490
He did not know what to do, so He took Her
child,

31:36.490 --> 31:46.690
that means representing sahaja yogi, you can
say, representing Christ

31:46.690 --> 31:58.409
or representing anyone of these great children
of Her’s, that he put the child

31:58.409 --> 32:00.520
under Her feet.

32:00.520 --> 32:03.039
So, when She was stamping,

32:03.039 --> 32:11.260
suddenly She saw Her own child under Her feet
and Her such a big tongue came out.

32:11.260 --> 32:12.710
She just stopped.

32:12.710 --> 32:13.710
Balancing.

32:13.710 --> 32:16.200
But this has happened only once.

32:16.200 --> 32:22.190
So, after the Ekadesha Rudra, ultimately the
complete destruction comes

32:22.190 --> 32:25.260
through the anger of Sadashiva.

32:25.260 --> 32:31.370
When the final total destruction takes place.

32:31.370 --> 32:41.140
So thus we have seen how Ekadesha Rudra acts

32:41.140 --> 32:45.190
and how sahaja yogis have to become themselves
Ekadesha Rudra.

32:45.190 --> 32:47.390
Now to develop this power

32:47.390 --> 32:51.350
one has to develop a tremendous power of detachment,

32:51.350 --> 32:53.990
power of detachment, detachment from negative.

32:53.990 --> 32:57.960
For example, negativity can come from very
near people,

32:57.960 --> 33:03.240
like brother, mother, sister, could come from
friends, could come from relatives.

33:03.240 --> 33:11.309
It could come from a country, it could come
from your political ideas, economic ideas,

33:11.309 --> 33:13.620
anything like that.

33:13.620 --> 33:19.690
Any misidentification can destroy your power
of Ekadesha Rudra.

33:19.690 --> 33:33.429
So it is not only sufficient to say that “I
am surrendered to Sahaja Yoga

33:33.429 --> 33:37.260
and I am a sahaja yogi,”

33:37.260 --> 33:40.990
but you must know mentally also what is Sahaja
Yoga.

33:40.990 --> 33:43.630
So that, intelligently, you understand what
is Sahaja Yoga.

33:43.630 --> 33:51.410
Because in the West specially people are over-intelligent

33:51.410 --> 33:58.080
and if the light of Sahaja Yoga does not enter
into their intelligence

33:58.080 --> 34:02.110
you can never overcome your attachments.

34:02.110 --> 34:17.190
That doesn’t mean you talk too much about
Sahaja Yoga or you give lectures on that,

34:17.190 --> 34:23.970
but mentally you should also understand what
is Sahaja Yoga.

34:23.970 --> 34:30.049
Today is a special day when it has been asked
that

34:30.049 --> 34:34.289
we should have Ekadesha Rudra puja,

34:34.289 --> 34:41.359
and is for all kinds of false religious sects
and false gurus

34:41.359 --> 34:54.769
and false religions, which are followed in
the name of God,

34:54.769 --> 35:00.329
or any religion that does not say about Self-realisation

35:00.329 --> 35:22.170
and does not achieve Self-realisation and
does not get connected with God, is false.

35:22.170 --> 35:26.569
So any such thing that is just faith and talks
of God

35:26.569 --> 35:29.619
but has no connection with God

35:29.619 --> 35:31.580
cannot be a true religion.

35:31.580 --> 35:35.400
Of course, it gives a balance to people,

35:35.400 --> 35:43.400
but in giving that balance, if people live
on that money

35:43.400 --> 36:07.609
and try to enjoy a wealth out of that money,

36:07.609 --> 36:16.750
then it is not even at the very lower level
is religion.

36:16.750 --> 36:34.170
Like a balance, you, see, religion has to
give a balance to begin with,

36:34.170 --> 37:32.660
but in that balancing when
they tell, “You have to

37:32.660 --> 37:35.289
be balanced,

37:35.289 --> 37:49.980
but give me money for that,

37:49.980 --> 38:03.999
you must give me money, give me all your purse,
give me everything,”

38:03.999 --> 38:23.969
then that cannot be balanced, it does not
even have a slightest thing of the blessings

38:23.969 --> 38:31.960
of God.

38:31.960 --> 38:52.309
Or any religion that makes you bow to
anybody else but the incarnation,

38:52.309 --> 38:56.999
is no religion.

38:56.999 --> 39:19.519
That’s another one which is absolutely false.

39:19.519 --> 39:47.530
The real religion will give you a balance
and will always talk

39:47.530 --> 39:54.499
about the ascent.

39:54.499 --> 40:30.800
But they will not ask for money or make one
man something great as venerated.

40:30.800 --> 40:36.910
Thus, we should learn to discriminate between
falsehood, negative things

40:36.910 --> 40:38.329
and real things.

40:38.329 --> 40:44.099
Once you develop that discrimination through
vibratory awareness,

40:44.099 --> 40:51.210
or through your intelligence, you are in the
control of yourself.

40:51.210 --> 42:12.049
And then

42:12.049 --> 43:29.890
you become that power

43:29.890 --> 43:40.279
of Ekadesha,

43:40.279 --> 44:08.440
when you establish your maturity.

44:08.440 --> 46:25.819
Today, I bless you all, that

46:25.819 --> 46:29.339
you all

46:29.339 --> 48:18.999
become the

48:18.999 --> 50:08.559
power of Ekadesha Rudra

50:08.559 --> 50:32.519
and

50:32.519 --> 50:47.690
you develop

50:47.690 --> 53:54.710
that sincerity which takes you to that state.

53:54.710 --> 59:41.359
May

59:41.359 --> 01:00:38.089
God

01:00:38.089 --> 01:03:49.509
Bless you.
