1
00:00:07,717 --> 00:00:12,693
Pujari: Now the names of Lord Vishnu. Om Shri Keshavaya Namah,

2
00:00:12,894 --> 00:00:18,522
Om Shri Narayanaya Namah, Om Shri Madhavaya Namah,

3
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:24,306
Om Shri Govindaya Namah, Om Shri Vishnuve Namah,

4
00:00:24,507 --> 00:00:29,661
Om (Shri) Madhusudanaya Namah, Om Shri Trivikramaya Namah,

5
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:35,095
Om Shri Vamanaya Namah, Om Shri Shridharaya Namah,

6
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:40,947
Om Shri Hrishikeshaya Namah, Om Shri Sankarshanaya Namah,

7
00:00:41,148 --> 00:00:46,835
Om Shri Vasudevaya Namah, Om Shri Pradyumnaya Namah,

8
00:00:47,036 --> 00:00:52,688
Om Shri Aniruddhaya Namah, Om Shri Purushottamaya Namah,

9
00:00:52,889 --> 00:00:58,250
Om Shri Aghokshajaya Namah, Om Shri Narasimhaya Namah,

10
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:03,572
Om Shri Achyutaya Namah, Om Shri Janardanaya Namah,

11
00:01:03,773 --> 00:01:09,003
Om Shri Padmanabhaya Namah, Om Shri Damodaraya Namah,

12
00:01:09,204 --> 00:01:14,545
Om Shri Upendraya Namah, Om Shri Haraye Namah,

13
00:01:14,746 --> 00:01:17,356
Om Shri Krishnaye Namah.

14
00:01:17,557 --> 00:01:20,771
Sakshat Shri Adi Shakti Bhagavati Mataji

15
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,950
Shri Nirmala Devyai Namoh Namah.

16
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:31,281
Shri Mataji: Why these twenty-one names are taken before every puja,

17
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:34,638
even before the today renovation of it?

18
00:01:34,839 --> 00:01:39,683
First you have to worship Shri Ganesha.

19
00:01:39,884 --> 00:01:43,604
But even before worshipping why these names are taken,

20
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:47,223
is important to understand, everything has a why.

21
00:01:47,424 --> 00:01:57,511
Because these are the twenty-one channels within your Sushumna,

22
00:01:57,712 --> 00:02:00,636
twenty-one channels, we should say, in this

23
00:02:00,837 --> 00:02:05,869
complete Ida, Pingala and Sushumna Nadi.

24
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:09,491
So to raise you,

25
00:02:14,516 --> 00:02:18,000
absolutely to give you the ascent,

26
00:02:18,258 --> 00:02:22,057
twenty- one channels in Ida, Pingala, Sushumna.

27
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:25,992
So one would say seven channels in the Sushumna Nadi.

28
00:02:26,193 --> 00:02:34,996
But these seven channels are divided multiplied by seven into three.

29
00:02:35,197 --> 00:02:40,541
So every channel has got twenty-one (inner? Unclear) channels.

30
00:02:44,311 --> 00:02:50,302
So Sushumna Nadi has got also twenty-one channels.

31
00:02:51,391 --> 00:02:53,879
Left-hand side Nadis are as you know that –

32
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:57,896
perhaps you know, I don’t know if you know the names or not.

33
00:02:58,144 --> 00:03:01,932
And the right hand side also, like Gayatri,

34
00:03:02,133 --> 00:03:06,697
Parvati and all these are on the righ hand side.

35
00:03:06,898 --> 00:03:14,056
And the left ones are called as Chamundi,

36
00:03:14,257 --> 00:03:19,489
and all these left-sided things, there are seven of them.

37
00:03:20,673 --> 00:03:26,246
Now, the central path has got twenty-one channels

38
00:03:26,367 --> 00:03:29,771
and has got twenty-one powers.

39
00:03:29,972 --> 00:03:34,643
And their deities are named

40
00:03:36,185 --> 00:03:40,865
according to the twenty-one aspects of Shri Vishnu.

41
00:03:41,066 --> 00:03:46,801
And that’s why these twenty-one aspects are first said,

42
00:03:47,002 --> 00:03:50,421
so that within you all these twenty-one channels are awakened.

43
00:03:50,622 --> 00:03:53,771
Within you, first of all.

44
00:03:53,972 --> 00:04:01,032
Puja is a double thing, that a cup has to be made

45
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:06,277
and then this source has to be opened out.

46
00:04:06,478 --> 00:04:08,318
So you are the cup.

47
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,838
The Sushumna is the channel you have by which you suck in.

48
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:18,588
So to open the Sushumna these twenty-one names are said.

49
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:23,760
Now, why first Shri Ganesha?

50
00:04:23,961 --> 00:04:28,070
Because Shri Ganesha is the beginning of the desire.

51
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:30,671
And the end of the desire.

52
00:04:30,902 --> 00:04:33,968
You start with Ganesha and end up with Ganesha.

53
00:04:34,169 --> 00:04:36,335
And that’s why Shri Ganesha is worshipped.

54
00:04:36,536 --> 00:04:40,140
Is the other way round now, the source.

55
00:04:40,411 --> 00:04:44,692
When you direct your attention to the source you worship it,

56
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:50,596
and when you want to incite or open out your own being,

57
00:04:50,717 --> 00:04:52,913
then you chant it.

58
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,244
This is the difference between worship and a mantra.

59
00:04:59,445 --> 00:05:04,123
If you just say mantra, you open yourself up.

60
00:05:04,324 --> 00:05:11,183
But when you worship and chant, then you tap the source.

61
00:05:11,987 --> 00:05:14,163
I don’t know if I’ve said this before or not.

62
00:05:14,284 --> 00:05:16,718
Yogi: No, no, no. Shri Mataji: No? All right.

63
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:19,406
That’s how you understand the puja part.

64
00:05:19,607 --> 00:05:27,248
Now, those who are newcomers, their cup is completely useless.

65
00:05:27,449 --> 00:05:30,729
And when you excite the deities, they get busy opening their cups,

66
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:33,368
everybody’s cups also. So it’s a double work.

67
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,378
But if your cup is ready, it’s very easy to fill in.

68
00:05:40,574 --> 00:05:43,301
So now these twenty-one names I think you should take again

69
00:05:43,422 --> 00:05:46,794
with the understanding, is better. All right.

70
00:05:49,355 --> 00:05:55,954
Pujari: Om Shri Keshavaya Namah, Om Shri Narayanaya Namah,

00:05:56,155 --> 00:06:02,672
