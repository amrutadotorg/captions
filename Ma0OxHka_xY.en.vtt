WEBVTT

03:34.610 --> 03:41.452
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesh.

03:43.428 --> 03:52.464
I think I have told you a lot about Him and
His nature,

03:52.665 --> 03:57.785
but still so many of us have not yet
realized

03:57.986 --> 04:03.314
what are His powers, and what He wants.

04:10.674 --> 04:16.472
First and foremost thing is that to respect
Shri Ganesha

04:16.673 --> 04:22.613
is to understand the importance
of chastity.

04:22.814 --> 04:30.898
Chastity is not only for the women, it is
more for the men to observe.

04:31.099 --> 04:37.780
If you have self-respect, in the real sense
of the word,

04:37.981 --> 04:41.627
you will take to chastity without
any difficulties.

04:41.828 --> 04:50.071
But if you have no self-respect, then you
run after something which is very low,

04:50.272 --> 04:55.983
of a very degrading quality.

04:56.499 --> 05:02.837
So it’s very important that chastity must
be respected,

05:03.038 --> 05:09.251
must be understood, and must be imbibed.

05:11.492 --> 05:18.221
This habit of not observing the proper
protocol

05:18.422 --> 05:25.749
of the chastity develops from childhood,
and we have to be very careful,

05:25.950 --> 05:35.068
when we are in a Ganesha state we should
not take to such horrible things.

05:35.269 --> 05:39.328
I don’t know from where people get
the ideas.

05:39.529 --> 05:48.325
As you see today in the whole world there’s
a crisis of chastity.

05:50.350 --> 05:58.149
In the West specially, we have heard
of so many cases of child abuse.

05:58.350 --> 06:01.372
In a temple of God one should not even take
the name

06:01.573 --> 06:05.928
of this dirty disease which has grabbed
the people.

06:06.129 --> 06:09.507
But in India we have never heard of it,
we don’t know.

06:09.708 --> 06:15.161
Of course, some of the men are very, very
ruined people

06:15.362 --> 06:21.239
and they can’t help it, unless and until
they are put into jail.

06:22.215 --> 06:28.309
But for a Sahaja yogi it is very important
to look after our chastities.

06:28.518 --> 06:31.681
As I told you yesterday, it is not
necessary

06:31.866 --> 06:35.889
to find a girl for yourself or a boy
for yourself.

06:36.090 --> 06:41.230
It’s also against the rules of chastity.

06:42.716 --> 06:47.650
I’m not saying that you should allow only
your parents to decide,

06:47.851 --> 06:53.694
but let the Sahaja Yoga decide, because
you are Sahajis.

06:53.895 --> 07:04.140
You are born after the image of Ganesha,
who ultimately becomes Christ.

07:04.341 --> 07:10.289
So what should be your attitude towards
chastity is very important.

07:12.230 --> 07:16.137
The most important thing, that

07:17.290 --> 07:25.589
if we get ruined on our chastity level
then Sahaja Yoga is very, very difficult,

07:25.790 --> 07:32.180
and it doesn’t give you that blessing
as you should have.

07:32.381 --> 07:38.117
You saw yesterday people from Romania
and also from Ukraine

07:38.318 --> 07:41.215
were singing so beautifully.

07:41.416 --> 07:48.883
One of the reasons is that basically they
are very, very humble people.

07:49.084 --> 07:55.118
They are humbled down, so much so that
they have given up nonsensical ideas

07:55.319 --> 07:59.692
about sex life and all that.

08:00.996 --> 08:07.985
So the humility will teach you that you are
not having your self-respect.

08:08.185 --> 08:14.527
In the Islam they have stressed a very big
importance on chastity, very much.

08:14.748 --> 08:19.788
And this was gone to such an extent that
Mohammed Sahib said that you can have

08:19.989 --> 08:28.398
five wives or four wives, but you don’t
have women who are prostitutes.

08:28.599 --> 08:37.175
Once this chastity starts leaving us,
we don’t mind anything under the sun.

08:37.376 --> 08:45.543
We have seen results of that working out
in many people who are very highly placed.

08:45.728 --> 08:50.065
And these highly placed people think that
they are something great,

08:50.266 --> 08:56.123
and they can overcome the binding of Jesus
Christ and they can do what they like,

08:56.324 --> 09:03.054
go on misbehaving with women who are
under them.

09:03.255 --> 09:08.304
They may do it secretly, they may do it
any way, but Ganesha watches that,

09:08.505 --> 09:12.753
and He punishes them for what they are
doing.

09:12.954 --> 09:16.786
It’s a terrible thing to go into these kind
of ventures,

09:16.987 --> 09:20.459
which are not the field of Sahaja yogis.

09:20.660 --> 09:24.300
Sahaja yogis have to first of all steady
their eyes,

09:24.501 --> 09:33.195
because it is concerned with the power
of Jesus Christ.

09:33.396 --> 09:37.489
But in all the Christian nations I have
seen people have wandering eyes –

09:37.690 --> 09:43.833
very surprising, when Christ is their
leader, they worship Christ,

09:44.034 --> 09:50.319
go to church, sing the praise of Christ,
and they have wandering eyes all over.

09:50.520 --> 09:58.060
These wandering eyes cannot be
representative of the chastity of Christ.

10:00.549 --> 10:13.665
Now the second point is that the power
of Ganesha can only be manifested

10:13.866 --> 10:19.131
if you are wise, because He is the giver
of wisdom.

10:19.332 --> 10:23.941
Now people don’t understand what is wisdom
is – this is the big problem.

10:24.163 --> 10:27.585
Intelligence, so-called, is not wisdom.

10:27.791 --> 10:31.761
It can make you a very cunning, very
aggressive,

10:31.962 --> 10:35.793
and sometimes very subtle person

10:35.994 --> 10:40.234
who can go on deceiving people, telling
lies, doing all kinds of things,

10:40.435 --> 10:46.638
and believing in themselves that they are
very, very successful.

10:46.839 --> 10:52.479
Success is never the criteria of a Sahaja
yogi.

10:52.735 --> 11:02.593
Success in Sahaja Yoga means very subtle
surrendering of oneself to Sahaja Yoga.

11:02.794 --> 11:10.377
That is seldom to be found unless and until
you meditate every day.

11:10.578 --> 11:13.717
It’s very important that you must meditate.

11:13.918 --> 11:17.912
Those who do not meditate will be lost
to Sahaja Yoga,

11:18.113 --> 11:23.719
because wisdom can only grow through
your inner inspiration.

11:24.069 --> 11:27.965
You can have this inner inspiration

11:30.524 --> 11:34.828
only if the power of Shri Ganesha
manifests.

11:35.029 --> 11:40.507
He is the giver of your wisdom.

11:40.708 --> 11:48.760
In the wisdom what you do is to find
solutions, solutions which are peaceful,

11:48.961 --> 11:53.899
which are satisfying, which are soothing.

11:54.100 --> 11:57.839
He is the one who takes you to task also.

11:58.040 --> 12:03.199
Like yesterday I was told there was
a whirlwind, and many people had to suffer

12:03.413 --> 12:10.372
little bit because of the wind that came
and blew off your tents.

12:11.245 --> 12:14.707
There’s no need to have tents in this
climate, what is the need?

12:14.908 --> 12:20.239
I don’t understand. But they cannot live
without a tent, you see.

12:20.440 --> 12:24.353
I can sleep outside very nicely,
on the street also.

12:24.554 --> 12:27.936
So there’s no need to sort of fuss about
all these things

12:28.137 --> 12:32.959
and bring the whole household here,
there’s no need.

12:33.237 --> 12:37.717
We should not be afraid of discomfort.

12:37.918 --> 12:43.470
If you want to have a very comfortable life
and you can’t suffer any discomfort,

12:43.671 --> 12:48.824
you are no good for Sahaja Yoga. In olden
days people used to go to Himalayas,

12:49.025 --> 12:53.327
stand on one leg, pray to God, and they
didn’t give realization,

12:53.528 --> 12:57.722
they couldn’t get realization; while you
all have got realization.

12:57.908 --> 13:05.673
So one should not try to make oneself very,
very sort of a lordly person.

13:05.874 --> 13:08.425
There is no need to care for comfort.

13:08.630 --> 13:14.492
I can live in comfort and I can live in any
way, at this age also.

13:14.693 --> 13:20.311
So what you have to do is to, not
to practice, I say, asceticism

13:20.512 --> 13:23.623
but to become an ascetic.

13:23.824 --> 13:28.781
Practicing means trouble, but if you just
become an ascetic from within,

13:28.982 --> 13:34.705
then you don’t bother about these little,
little things here and there.

13:34.906 --> 13:39.799
But our style is still molded by outside
world.

13:40.029 --> 13:46.926
We haven’t got our own world, then we are
going as the fashion is.

13:47.127 --> 13:51.937
And once you start going with the fashion,
the wisdom disappears.

13:52.138 --> 13:56.282
I never tell anybody that you don’t have
this fashion or that fashion or anything.

13:56.483 --> 14:00.447
It’s your wisdom which will teach you.
Wisdom will teach you

14:00.648 --> 14:05.771
how to regulate yourself, because you have
come here to ascend,

14:05.972 --> 14:15.150
to achieve a very special place
in the realm of spirituality.

14:16.635 --> 14:21.475
I must stress again on the power of wisdom.

14:21.676 --> 14:25.063
Before doing anything you should just
appeal to your wisdom

14:25.264 --> 14:29.294
and find out if it is wise to be like that.

14:29.495 --> 14:34.308
With this practice you will reduce
your temper, absolutely.

14:34.509 --> 14:42.027
You’ll reduce your lust, you’ll reduce
your guilt very much;

14:42.228 --> 14:45.876
because once you start understanding that
there’s no wisdom

14:46.077 --> 14:50.197
in feeling guilty, your guilt will
disappear.

14:50.398 --> 14:56.781
Also the worst thing is that we have
a great desire to have this, have that,

14:56.982 --> 15:02.960
and to indulge into all kinds of greed.

15:03.161 --> 15:08.737
This greed becomes zero as soon as you
understand

15:08.938 --> 15:11.577
wisely that there’s no need.

15:11.778 --> 15:16.618
Otherwise all the time you’ll be thinking
about yourself, about your health,

15:16.819 --> 15:22.589
about your children, about your house,
whatever is supposed to be yours.

15:22.790 --> 15:27.364
But the death proves that there’s nothing
belongs to you.

15:27.565 --> 15:31.947
You have come alone, and you have to go
alone.

15:32.148 --> 15:37.691
This is the wisdom which is to be imbibed.
You cannot practice it,

15:37.892 --> 15:42.897
you cannot force it, but it’s to be imbibed
through your spirituality.

15:43.098 --> 15:46.466
Then the greatest thing that happens is
the joy,

15:46.667 --> 15:52.166
joy of the dancing of Shri Ganesh.

15:52.367 --> 15:59.087
Like a child you see Him dancing; how
joyous He feels, and you also feel.

15:59.288 --> 16:05.041
In the same way, a little child being born
within you,

16:05.242 --> 16:09.090
and you start behaving like a small child.

16:09.291 --> 16:16.820
Normally it has no sense of lust, greed,
nothing. It knows how to share.

16:17.021 --> 16:22.163
So this is the position, we say, that you
become a gana –

16:22.364 --> 16:29.208
the army of Shri Ganesh, they are ganas
and they are very powerful.

16:29.409 --> 16:33.667
And they do all the work of the world,
they live in this world,

16:33.868 --> 16:39.524
but all their source of energy is from
the Divine.

16:39.901 --> 16:44.489
So Shri Ganesha is an Omkara.

16:44.690 --> 16:48.857
He is the first created deity
by the Goddess,

16:49.032 --> 16:56.242
because He is auspiciousness. So, first
auspiciousness is created for our good.

16:56.443 --> 17:02.776
We are auspicious because of Shri Ganesha.
Some people, if they are in the house

17:02.977 --> 17:07.849
they create problems. They are always
creating problems out of nothing.

17:08.050 --> 17:12.608
They are not auspicious people. Those
who are peacemakers,

17:12.809 --> 17:19.523
those who are loving are the ones who are
blessed by Shri Ganesha.

17:19.724 --> 17:26.647
What is the wisdom in fighting? You should
find out, what is the wisdom in fighting?

17:26.848 --> 17:30.875
Why are you fighting, for what things?
For small, small things,

17:31.076 --> 17:35.030
things that you can yourself correct?
Why should you fight?

17:35.231 --> 17:39.506
If you have a fighting nature, that means
Ganesha is against you,

17:39.707 --> 17:44.508
is your Ganesha is sleeping; that power is
not with you, there is no wisdom in it.

17:44.709 --> 17:48.708
In this world, all those great people who
have been respected

17:48.892 --> 17:53.516
since centuries have been very, very
wise people –

17:53.717 --> 17:58.249
not hot-tempered, not people who were
quarreling,

17:58.450 --> 18:03.708
not people who were having lust as the aim
of their life.

18:03.909 --> 18:07.382
Such people will be never remembered
by the progeny.

18:07.583 --> 18:12.569
But that’s not so important, as you as
Sahaja yogis are very important.

18:12.770 --> 18:19.228
You are here on this earth to emancipate
the whole of humanity.

18:19.429 --> 18:26.042
So, what should be the aim of your life
is to go deep into your spirituality.

18:26.243 --> 18:31.263
This aim of getting into spirituality,
I think you all know, you see,

18:31.464 --> 18:35.039
but you do not work out.

18:35.214 --> 18:40.279
I have told you last time that your
attention has to be inside,

18:40.480 --> 18:43.079
not outside, and you should not react.

18:43.280 --> 18:51.722
All these procedures help you to be wise,
to be sensible.

18:51.923 --> 18:59.349
But the sensible person who is just sensible
as far as his own comforts are concerned,

18:59.550 --> 19:04.304
money is concerned or his own health
is concerned –

19:04.505 --> 19:11.552
everything encompassing him – is
not a wise person. He is not wise.

19:11.753 --> 19:16.833
If you see a little child, who is properly
brought up of course,

19:17.034 --> 19:20.138
he will always bother about other people.

19:20.339 --> 19:27.328
He’ll find out what others need, what are
– what can make them happy.

19:27.529 --> 19:33.275
He’ll list all the simple methods, he will
try to please others,

19:33.476 --> 19:38.889
but not to gain any favor or to show off
that he is very generous,

19:39.067 --> 19:45.951
but in the real sense of the word, that
gives him joy. That is the collectivity.

19:46.152 --> 19:49.607
Today I am going to tell you something more
about this collective nature

19:49.808 --> 19:58.037
that comes to you through Shri Ganesha’s
efforts, or we can say His powers.

19:59.783 --> 20:03.919
Somebody told Me that Einstein has already
made a story like that,

20:04.120 --> 20:08.815
is a discovery that if you all become cool,

20:09.016 --> 20:17.265
that is under the Shri Ganesha’s blessings,
then we all become one.

20:18.551 --> 20:25.327
That’s his theory, but we also had
Phil Ward here who established

20:25.528 --> 20:29.622
that when you cool down the helium gas,

20:29.823 --> 20:38.034
all the molecules or you can call them
atoms,

20:38.248 --> 20:42.055
they start moving in a collective way.

20:42.256 --> 20:46.011
Otherwise they are hitting each other,
they are beating each other

20:46.212 --> 20:48.851
and they are running helter and skelter.

20:49.052 --> 20:53.676
In the same way, when we have
Shri Ganesha’s blessings within us

20:53.877 --> 20:56.882
in the real sense of the word,
with our wisdom,

20:57.083 --> 21:04.644
then what happens, we become very much
evolved Sahaja yogis.

21:04.845 --> 21:09.301
“Evolved Sahaja yogis” are, means they
have become one.

21:09.502 --> 21:15.161
“One” means what? “One” means they all
live for each other,

21:15.362 --> 21:21.924
they enjoy each other, they see the comfort
of each other.

21:22.125 --> 21:29.031
For example, the people who are very rich,
people who are very poor,

21:29.232 --> 21:31.820
people who are sick, people who are
healthy,

21:32.021 --> 21:35.869
all of them combine together as one.

21:36.070 --> 21:41.473
In Sanskrit it is called “ekakarita” –
they become one.

21:41.674 --> 21:46.964
And this oneness shows in your
celebrations, when you all come here

21:47.165 --> 21:49.815
you try to help each other all the time,
I’ve seen –

21:50.016 --> 21:52.880
nobody minds helping each other.

21:53.081 --> 21:58.800
I have seen people enjoying each other.
They do not want to hurt anyone;

21:59.001 --> 22:03.692
on the contrary, they want to be helpful
and sensible with each other.

22:03.893 --> 22:11.899
Most of your leaders I have chosen who are
very wise, who avoid problems,

22:12.100 --> 22:16.821
who do not get into panics, most of them,
I should say.

22:17.022 --> 22:22.796
And when you see, even you people try
to destroy Sahaja Yoga,

22:22.997 --> 22:25.510
they know you are doing it.

22:25.711 --> 22:31.176
So to find out this ekakarita, you have
to go deep down into yourself,

22:31.377 --> 22:34.551
by which you will feel that you are
all one.

22:34.752 --> 22:40.616
Whether you are here or you are in Japan
or in America, anywhere,

22:40.817 --> 22:45.480
you all think the same way, you all help
the same cause,

22:45.681 --> 22:49.105
and you try to be the same style.

22:49.306 --> 22:54.448
I have seen people when they come
for the pujas, so many of them,

22:54.649 --> 23:00.347
how they enjoy each other’s company,
how they try to help each other.

23:00.548 --> 23:08.962
Somebody who is, say, in Russia or say,
in Bulgaria, anywhere,

23:09.163 --> 23:16.064
he will write to Me about the problem
he has, something.

23:16.265 --> 23:20.928
So somebody from America, without I tell
him, without I inform him,

23:21.129 --> 23:25.891
without any information immediately writes
to Me, “Mother, such and such a person

23:26.092 --> 23:31.954
is there in Russia. Will You be able
to send that person to America?”.

23:32.948 --> 23:37.669
Most of the time it happens like this.
But I don’t tell them.

23:37.870 --> 23:41.782
I never ask them. Even if I ask, suddenly

23:41.983 --> 23:48.176
there will be a response from so many
people, from so many countries,

23:48.377 --> 23:53.246
“Mother, this is the problem? All right,
we’ll go and do it." For that I must say

23:53.447 --> 23:59.051
Austrians are very sensitive people
in this respect, in this ekakarita.

23:59.252 --> 24:03.884
They went all the way to Jerusalem,

24:04.587 --> 24:10.144
you know, to help the people, to get
them realized.

24:10.345 --> 24:15.293
I wanted to go to Jerusalem, but this
bombing business may not allow Me to go.

24:15.494 --> 24:21.271
But the Jerusalem people, I found them,
found them to be much more collective,

24:21.439 --> 24:26.620
because they came to Egypt.
I said, “Why have you come here?”

24:26.821 --> 24:32.325
“Make friends with the Muslims of Egypt."

24:33.069 --> 24:36.431
Just imagine! I was surprised.
How could they come here?

24:36.632 --> 24:41.400
“No, just to make friends. They are Muslims,
so we want to make friends with them.”

24:41.600 --> 24:45.626
So making friendship without any ulterior
motive,

24:45.827 --> 24:50.935
without any gain, is one of the signs
of your ekakarita.

24:51.136 --> 24:54.392
Not only that you are satisfied with other
Sahaja yogis,

24:54.593 --> 25:00.950
but you want to bring other Sahaja yogis in.
So many have done that.

25:01.151 --> 25:06.958
This is something so nourishing.

25:07.851 --> 25:13.784
Now, as you are been enlightened,

25:13.985 --> 25:20.108
you get another person who is enlightened.
It’s very great joy-giving.

25:20.309 --> 25:24.602
If you give realization to one person,
you feel very happy.

25:24.803 --> 25:30.608
I mean, so many write to Me, “Mother, now
we have got thirty persons, twenty persons”,

25:30.809 --> 25:34.797
and they are very happy about it, that
we have got so many Sahaja yogis.

25:34.998 --> 25:40.004
But doing that, one should not develop
the ego – then again you go against Ganesha,

25:40.205 --> 25:44.140
because Christ, you know, He doesn’t
like it.

25:44.341 --> 25:48.701
Egoistical people He doesn’t like, and
He is Shri Ganesh.

25:48.902 --> 25:54.660
So He doesn’t like such people who
out of their ego want to create

25:54.861 --> 25:59.095
an organization of their own, and try
to dominate others.

25:59.309 --> 26:02.808
This kind of people they don’t like.

26:03.015 --> 26:07.816
Both of them are the same, there is
complete ekakarita between them.

26:08.017 --> 26:13.236
In the same way we too develop that special
quality of ekakarita.

26:13.437 --> 26:18.399
We forget about so-called religions that
we have. See now how they are fighting.

26:18.600 --> 26:21.868
All the religions which are outside are
fighting among themselves.

26:22.069 --> 26:26.278
They are dishonest, they are doing all kinds
of wrong things – you know it very well.

26:26.479 --> 26:31.682
Every day it’s in the newspaper that you
hear about what wrong they are doing.

26:31.883 --> 26:34.816
They are little bit successful, but not
for a long time,

26:35.017 --> 26:38.035
because they’ll be exposed. This is
the time of exposure,

26:38.236 --> 26:45.546
that they will lose that great faith
on which they have been working out.

26:45.747 --> 26:50.118
All these will have to just disappear,

26:50.319 --> 26:55.367
these false ideas about superiority
of any religion.

26:55.568 --> 26:58.833
How can a religion be superior to another
one,

26:59.034 --> 27:04.375
which is created by the effort
of Shri Ganesha’s auspiciousness?

27:04.576 --> 27:08.320
It’s not auspicious at all that you fight
another religion

27:08.521 --> 27:17.012
or you fight another creed, or you say
that this is a lesser race,

27:17.213 --> 27:23.012
or we are a higher race. All these false
ideas, they drop out.

27:23.213 --> 27:28.242
This doesn’t remain anymore, because all
these ideas have created problems.

27:28.443 --> 27:34.463
Say in America, they first hated the blacks,
so now the blacks are hating the whites.

27:34.664 --> 27:37.985
It’s a big turmoil going on, you see.

27:38.199 --> 27:48.547
Then we have, also in India we had people
who were supposed to be untouchables.

27:48.748 --> 27:53.022
They were tortured, they were troubled,
and they did a lot of wrong things

27:53.223 --> 27:56.995
which they should have never done, which is
not written in the shastras.

27:57.196 --> 28:02.739
Because of that now they are acting against
the so-called “touchables”

28:02.940 --> 28:09.639
and putting them right in their own places.
So this brings in conflict.

28:09.840 --> 28:13.453
Shri Ganesha is the one, when He gives you
wisdom, you understand

28:13.654 --> 28:17.151
that nobody is superior to another person.

28:17.352 --> 28:24.199
You are all made by God, and is whatever is
made by God is auspicious and beautiful.

28:24.400 --> 28:30.396
Once you start understanding that,
this ekakarita spreads outside also.

28:30.597 --> 28:38.419
It spreads to other people. It’s not just
because of a certain social understanding

28:38.620 --> 28:44.598
and a social upliftment you try to be good
to others – no.

28:44.799 --> 28:48.423
It is from inside; inside you do it.

28:48.624 --> 28:52.744
This ekakarita first must work
in the family. It’s very important.

28:52.945 --> 28:57.341
The family which is disturbed all the time
cannot create children

28:57.542 --> 29:01.635
who are in the state of ekakarita.

29:01.836 --> 29:06.457
That’s why always tell them that don’t
fight.

29:06.658 --> 29:11.732
In the family they are fighting, they
cannot be Sahaja yogis.

29:11.933 --> 29:15.212
If there is such a fight it’s better
to get out of such a family.

29:15.413 --> 29:18.779
So we have sanctioned also a divorce.

29:18.980 --> 29:23.844
Any man who is flirting with other women
or doing wrong things,

29:24.045 --> 29:26.478
we have asked him to get out
of Sahaja Yoga.

29:26.679 --> 29:30.172
The reason is, one bad apple can spoil many
apples.

29:30.373 --> 29:34.776
So such a man or such a woman should be
kept out of Sahaja Yoga completely,

29:34.977 --> 29:38.590
so that there is a better family
relationship,

29:38.791 --> 29:41.653
which is very important in Sahaja Yoga.

29:41.854 --> 29:47.484
Your family relationships should be
absolutely perfect.

29:47.685 --> 29:52.502
But I can’t understand: you can’t enjoy
the company of your wife,

29:52.703 --> 29:55.377
then what are you going to enjoy
in this world?

29:55.578 --> 30:01.628
If you cannot enjoy the bliss of your family
life, you cannot enjoy anything else.

30:01.829 --> 30:06.815
This very close relationship of husband
and wife is thrown apart

30:07.016 --> 30:09.723
because of Ganesha problem only.

30:09.924 --> 30:14.527
If the Ganesha was all right there would
have been a perfect union,

30:14.728 --> 30:19.114
perfect understanding between husband
and wife. But that fails,

30:19.315 --> 30:25.138
that means there’s definitely something
wrong with the Shri Ganesha.

30:25.339 --> 30:30.247
Try to correct your own Shri Ganesh
than to see to others.

30:30.448 --> 30:35.387
You have to meditate, and meditate
on Shri Ganesh,

30:35.588 --> 30:38.799
you sit on the ground and meditate.

30:39.000 --> 30:43.840
Now when we run away from the Mother Earth
and we don’t touch her,

30:44.041 --> 30:49.487
we don’t respect her, in a way we don’t
respect Shri Ganesha.

30:49.688 --> 30:54.836
He was made out of Mother Earth,
and He controls the Mother Earth.

30:55.037 --> 31:03.639
He controls all the five elements. Not only
that, but He controls you.

31:03.840 --> 31:08.184
I liked the film yesterday where they
showed a Ganesha walking about

31:08.385 --> 31:12.680
with another person, who was telling,
“Don’t do this, and don’t do this.”

31:12.881 --> 31:16.732
It’s a very, very beautiful film, because
it suggests

31:16.933 --> 31:20.577
that Ganesha is always there to tell you
not to do it.

31:20.778 --> 31:25.156
But if you do it then you develop all kinds
of horrible diseases,

31:25.357 --> 31:31.744
all kinds of horrible faces, all kinds
of family problems;

31:31.945 --> 31:35.417
also you can develop national problems.

31:35.618 --> 31:43.699
So this is so important to understand,
that such a feeling of,

31:44.493 --> 31:52.698
I should say, very inauspicious character
are to be avoided.

31:52.899 --> 31:58.216
I can’t understand, how can people feel
so bad about small, small children,

31:58.394 --> 32:01.258
some two-year-old child, some
five-year-old child?

32:01.459 --> 32:06.304
If you see a child, even a photograph
of a child, you feel like loving that,

32:06.505 --> 32:10.986
you feel like kissing that child.
If the children cannot be respected,

32:11.187 --> 32:15.158
how can you understand the value
of Shri Ganesha?

32:15.359 --> 32:19.700
See how sweet they are, how sweetly
they behave,

32:19.901 --> 32:26.049
and they are – they understand! They
understand you, they understand Me.

32:26.250 --> 32:29.154
I know, even the small children, those who
are very small,

32:29.355 --> 32:32.359
newly-born children understand Me.

32:32.560 --> 32:38.955
So there’s innately within them is built in
a kind of a feeling

32:39.156 --> 32:42.967
of understanding the love.

32:43.168 --> 32:48.316
To understand the love also is very
difficult for egoistical people,

32:48.501 --> 32:51.094
because they love themselves, they don’t
love anybody else.

32:51.295 --> 32:55.234
Or if they love somebody it is out of lust,
maybe greed,

32:55.435 --> 32:59.984
maybe some sort of a association.

33:00.185 --> 33:03.372
But love for love’s sake is only possible

33:03.573 --> 33:10.139
if your Shri Ganesha is properly cleaned
out and kept there.

33:10.791 --> 33:18.085
We have come so far, and we have so many
Sahaja yogis all over the world.

33:18.286 --> 33:21.200
Of course, I have worked very hard,
I must say,

33:21.401 --> 33:26.529
but you also have supported Me very much.
I am thankful to you.

33:26.730 --> 33:31.679
It’s not possible in this Western world
specially, where there’s no consideration

33:31.880 --> 33:38.592
of Ganesha’s Principle, that you people
should come out so well

33:38.793 --> 33:44.219
and accept Sahaja Yoga as a life
for yourself.

33:44.420 --> 33:52.161
In Sahaja Yog the most important thing is
to worship Shri Ganesha within you,

33:52.835 --> 33:57.537
and the quality of Shri Ganesha within you.
It’s very soothing,

33:57.738 --> 34:06.831
it’s very peace-giving, it’s very secure,
secure – security-creating power.

34:07.032 --> 34:11.810
If your Ganesha is all right nobody can
touch you,

34:12.011 --> 34:17.813
nobody can destroy you, nobody can
upset you

34:18.014 --> 34:21.292
because He is the one who is the giver
of peace.

34:21.493 --> 34:26.138
The world peace is disturbed because
we have not worshipped Shri Ganesha.

34:26.339 --> 34:29.264
I’ve seen people in very big positions,

34:29.465 --> 34:34.509
in charge of military, in charge of that,
in charge – not in charge of themselves.

34:34.710 --> 34:37.968
Their Ganesha is absolutely ruined and finished.

34:38.169 --> 34:42.263
All such people are such leaders
of nations,

34:42.464 --> 34:46.385
and people try to follow them
in their own way.

34:46.586 --> 34:50.763
Though they may do something secretly,
doesn’t matter; people know about it.

34:50.964 --> 34:54.871
Because in auspiciousness if you are
losing,

34:55.072 --> 34:59.745
then the whole world comes to know,
somehow.

34:59.946 --> 35:04.425
It will all be exposed, because Satya Yuga
has come.

35:04.626 --> 35:10.316
In this new Yuga there’s light of the truth
within us,

35:10.517 --> 35:18.971
and this truth can expose all that is
nonsensical we have been doing.

35:19.172 --> 35:26.856
Now truth is the quality of Shri Ganesh
Himself.

35:27.095 --> 35:32.410
He is the one who is giving us truth.

35:32.618 --> 35:38.423
In our brain it comes to us through
Jesus Christ.

35:40.464 --> 35:46.712
Jesus Christ has worked so much, He’s done
so much;

35:46.913 --> 35:52.417
but look at the condition of the people
who are supposed to be following Him,

35:53.263 --> 35:58.951
look at the way they are behaving. Let us
at least show that if you follow

35:59.152 --> 36:05.465
Ganesha and Jesus Christ, you are
in the image of that personality

36:05.666 --> 36:11.896
which is something so very spiritual.
Spiritual life is the giver of joy.

36:12.097 --> 36:16.311
You cannot get joy out of anything else
but spirituality.

36:16.512 --> 36:19.533
You can get some satisfaction, you can get
some ego,

36:19.734 --> 36:23.894
you might feel that you are something
great, but the only way you can get

36:24.095 --> 36:32.328
the inner peace and joy is Shri Ganesha’s
manifestation in all the chakras.

36:32.529 --> 36:38.508
He manifests in all the chakras which,
when you are

36:39.261 --> 36:44.324
in a proper state on those chakras,
you get the joy,

36:44.525 --> 36:50.678
and that joy comes to you through
Shri Ganesh.

36:51.305 --> 36:55.314
These days people are writing horrible
books, horrible things.

36:55.515 --> 37:01.982
Also there are some who are trying to write
very sweet things

37:02.183 --> 37:06.548
about Shri Ganesha’s principle
of understanding,

37:06.749 --> 37:11.059
principle of His auspiciousness.

37:11.260 --> 37:13.923
Very sweetly I’ve seen some people have
written

37:14.124 --> 37:19.512
some very, very sweet stories about Him.

37:19.713 --> 37:24.267
It’s not only the love stories –
up to a point, all right,

37:24.468 --> 37:28.197
they created so many love stories,
love stories, love stories.

37:28.398 --> 37:31.589
Now something beyond that one has to know.

37:31.790 --> 37:36.771
And beyond that is this Ganesha Principle,

37:36.972 --> 37:43.773
which is of complete peace, of complete
joy,

37:44.335 --> 37:50.864
and of understanding of love, the value
of pure love;

37:51.065 --> 37:55.099
of giving, and also of taking it.

37:55.300 --> 38:02.258
Anyone who gives you the pure love
should be understood in the right way.

38:02.746 --> 38:08.160
I yesterday knew that Shri Ganesha has gone
off a little bit.

38:08.361 --> 38:13.658
I don’t know why He was like that,
but one has to understand

38:13.859 --> 38:17.219
that there must be some people within us
who do not follow

38:17.420 --> 38:22.191
the Principle of Shri Ganesh, and that’s
why these troubles are there.

38:22.392 --> 38:27.430
So with sincere heart and a sincere mind

38:27.631 --> 38:32.584
if you ask the blessings of Shri Ganesh,
He is always ready to give you.

38:32.785 --> 38:43.319
But if you don’t listen to Him and if you
destroy your chastity in any way,

38:43.520 --> 38:50.125
He will punish you. He’ll not spare you,
He doesn’t have the idea of sparing.

38:50.326 --> 38:58.049
At the level of Christ only, He thought
of forgiving, of forgiving you.

38:58.250 --> 39:04.425
But forgiving doesn’t mean that any, any
sin can be forgiven – no.

39:04.626 --> 39:08.092
It's like a kind of a controlling power.

39:08.293 --> 39:14.035
Christ has said that you’ll be forgiven,
but Shri Ganesha at a point,

39:14.236 --> 39:22.558
when He sees people are forgiving,
He tries to punish you.

39:23.756 --> 39:27.199
That’s the limiting point where He thinks
it’s not proper

39:27.400 --> 39:34.084
to forgive such and such person. So
for Christ, to forgive is all right,

39:34.814 --> 39:41.041
but for Ganesha, He has to expose
and punish the person.

39:41.228 --> 39:46.704
So in a way you have to know that Christ is
very great,

39:46.905 --> 39:51.100
because He gives us, He gives us
the forgiving power job,

39:51.301 --> 39:59.158
and Shri Ganesha is very powerful because
He limits our forgiving power.

39:59.359 --> 40:05.740
You may forgive anyone, you may say that,
“I would like to forgive,”

40:05.941 --> 40:11.555
but we don’t know if Shri Ganesh will
allow to that extent.

40:11.756 --> 40:16.162
And Christ accepts that, because they are
the same,

40:16.363 --> 40:18.889
they are like the two sides of one coin.

40:19.090 --> 40:25.310
So we cannot depend too much

40:25.511 --> 40:31.764
on the forgiveness power of Christ, because
there is Ganesha always sitting there

40:31.965 --> 40:39.128
and He has in His hand, you have seen,
a very powerful weapon.

40:39.329 --> 40:45.417
He is the one who is just peace, who is
coolness,

40:45.618 --> 40:48.842
who gives you coolness after realization.

40:49.024 --> 40:53.389
You get the cool breeze because
of Shri Ganesh,

40:53.944 --> 41:01.327
because it is Brahmachaitanya, no doubt,
but the one who emits it is Shri Ganesha.

41:01.528 --> 41:08.412
He cools you down. He brings you down
to a very cool, satisfied,

41:08.613 --> 41:14.213
and a person with complete calmness.

41:14.414 --> 41:17.201
With that calmness you become all one.

41:17.402 --> 41:21.313
This ekakarita is established, oneness is
established.

41:21.514 --> 41:32.027
Whatever country you may be believing in,
whatever country you may be proud of,

41:32.228 --> 41:37.183
you will see the bad things in that country
and you will try to improve that.

41:37.384 --> 41:39.709
You will not be identified with the bad.

41:39.910 --> 41:44.239
This is the greatest thing of the Satya
Yuga, that it exposes,

41:44.440 --> 41:49.067
and you do not support something
that is wrong,

41:49.268 --> 41:55.719
which is being done as a aggression
– you don’t accept.

41:55.920 --> 42:01.242
And once you don’t accept that, then
you start becoming one with the people

42:01.443 --> 42:05.982
who are one with you. And they all
believe in the same thing,

42:06.183 --> 42:11.186
their ideas are the same, their thinking
is the same, their joy is the same,

42:11.411 --> 42:13.979
and they enjoy each other very much.

42:14.180 --> 42:21.071
They become one, and this oneness has to be
established fully in Sahaja Yoga.

42:21.624 --> 42:24.799
Some people who are only interested
in making money,

42:25.000 --> 42:29.578
who are interested in getting a good crowd
or some sort of a thing

42:29.779 --> 42:35.951
of a very low level, cannot; those who are
in Sahaja Yoga to find

42:36.152 --> 42:41.083
wives for themselves or husbands for
themselves, aren’t going to.

42:41.284 --> 42:44.683
This spirituality grows with humility.

42:44.884 --> 42:51.945
And the humility of Ganesha is told by
His venture once, when His Mother asked Him

42:52.146 --> 42:58.229
that, “The one who will go round the Earth
three times, I’ll give Him a present."

42:58.430 --> 43:06.919
So Ganesha thought, “Who is greater
than My Mother? Not this Earth."

43:07.120 --> 43:10.331
He had a small little rat on which He used
to travel.

43:10.532 --> 43:16.756
This shows that He was so humble: on a rat
He could travel, no pressure on the rat.

43:16.957 --> 43:25.928
And while His brother Kartikeya had
a peacock which could fly,

43:26.113 --> 43:32.251
so He knew He cannot go round the world
and win over His brother.

43:32.452 --> 43:37.874
So He just went round His Mother three
times, and He got the present.

43:38.075 --> 43:44.292
This shows one thing, that speed is not
the way of success.

43:44.493 --> 43:47.562
You have to slow down your speed.

43:47.768 --> 43:52.097
Apart from that, you have to understand
what is the most important thing,

43:52.298 --> 43:57.442
as He understood the most important
thing is

43:59.442 --> 44:02.451
to love your Mother, to respect
your Mother,

44:02.652 --> 44:10.544
and know that She is the highest, She is
the greatest.

44:10.745 --> 44:17.369
And that is how He has been expressed
within ourselves.

44:17.570 --> 44:21.289
Once that happens, your spirituality grows.

44:21.490 --> 44:28.611
I hope you will work it out this way now,
Shri Ganesha, and start an ekakarita.

44:28.812 --> 44:31.975
I don’t like people writing letters against
their leaders,

44:32.176 --> 44:37.262
against this man, against that man.
That’s not good. There’s no need.

44:37.463 --> 44:46.307
If you just can be forgiving, and keeping
one with each other.

44:46.508 --> 44:51.903
Try to get more people, and more people.
You cannot separate anyone

44:52.104 --> 44:56.020
as saying that they are condemned,
they are no good. Try to get them.

44:56.221 --> 45:00.930
With your forgiveness, with your sense
of chastity, things will improve.

45:01.131 --> 45:04.223
So this exclusiveness also should be
given up,

45:04.424 --> 45:08.899
which perhaps comes from a kind of a sense
of insecurity, I think.

45:09.100 --> 45:13.007
It is Shri Ganesha! If they are wrong type
of people, He drives them out.

45:13.208 --> 45:16.999
So don’t get frightened of them, and don’t
get upset with them.

45:17.200 --> 45:25.531
Try to be one, one, and try to be more
attracting people to yourself,

45:25.732 --> 45:31.095
keeping them to you, trying to manage them
and look after them.

45:31.296 --> 45:36.678
I hope you will all meditate now after this
to develop your Ganesha qualities,

45:36.879 --> 45:44.251
and develop that power of chastity,
and also of peace and security.

45:44.452 --> 45:47.190
May God bless you.
