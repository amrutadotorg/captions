00:05:23.125 --> 00:05:26.666
Today we have assembled here

00:05:27.125 --> 00:05:31.875
to worship Sadashiva,

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:38.458
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

00:05:42.666 --> 00:05:45.791
He is reflected in our heart,

00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:53.541
and as you have seen

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:01.291
that the goal of our life

00:06:02.917 --> 00:06:08.917
was to achieve this state of spirit.

00:06:13.917 --> 00:06:17.708
The other day I was reading some books

00:06:19.458 --> 00:06:24.541
how it was done,

00:06:28.708 --> 00:06:33.249
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

00:06:33.958 --> 00:06:38.708
and how people were tortured.

00:06:40.207 --> 00:06:45.625
First of all they're asked to

00:06:47.958 --> 00:06:53.791
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

00:06:56.333 --> 00:07:00.958
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

00:07:02.207 --> 00:07:10.750
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

00:07:11.167 --> 00:07:13.917
not on the bed.

00:07:15.042 --> 00:07:18.833
Then still, it's not enough;

00:07:19.333 --> 00:07:22.333
then from the carpet you go to a mat

00:07:23.708 --> 00:07:25.499
still is not enough.

00:07:25.833 --> 00:07:29.167
Then from that maybe,

00:07:30.583 --> 00:07:33.249
you move down

00:07:34.291 --> 00:07:38.125
to the Mother Earth,

00:07:38.416 --> 00:07:40.541
sleep on the Mother Earth.

00:07:41.374 --> 00:07:45.249
Still if the body is not all right

00:07:45.499 --> 00:07:49.833
then you start sleeping on the stone.

00:07:50.374 --> 00:07:54.083
But still the Himalayas are far away,

00:07:54.833 --> 00:07:57.291
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

00:07:57.625 --> 00:08:02.291
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

00:08:02.625 --> 00:08:07.125
This was the minimum requirement.

00:08:08.416 --> 00:08:15.833
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

00:08:18.083 --> 00:08:20.499
you want to have sumptuous food,

00:08:20.833 --> 00:08:23.750
you eat a lot, all right;

00:08:24.374 --> 00:08:27.875
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:30.000
all that you like.

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:33.666
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

00:08:39.291 --> 00:08:43.875
Then deny that.

00:08:45.499 --> 00:08:48.042
But that's not sufficient.

00:08:48.499 --> 00:08:51.750
After that you start eating things

00:08:52.458 --> 00:08:54.499
which are very bitter.

00:08:54.833 --> 00:08:58.249
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

00:08:58.583 --> 00:09:02.291
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

00:09:02.625 --> 00:09:07.416
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

00:09:07.750 --> 00:09:11.167
So put your tongue into test.

00:09:12.625 --> 00:09:15.458
But still the stomach is there.

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.458
So if you are eating too much,

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.374
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

00:09:22.750 --> 00:09:24.708
Then fast for seven days.

00:09:25.042 --> 00:09:26.833
Then for forty days.

00:09:27.207 --> 00:09:31.583
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

00:09:31.875 --> 00:09:34.833
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

00:09:35.167 --> 00:09:40.042
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

00:09:40.291 --> 00:09:41.750
As it is you get a nirvana

00:09:42.083 --> 00:09:44.249
because you're finished and dead, you see,

00:09:44.625 --> 00:09:49.042
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

00:09:49.291 --> 00:09:53.207
and these bones then become nirvana.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:55.541
Ultimately the death follows,

00:09:55.875 --> 00:09:57.291
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

00:09:57.541 --> 00:09:59.875
no doubt about it.

00:10:02.042 --> 00:10:04.167
Then you don't live in a house,

00:10:04.499 --> 00:10:06.249
because house is comfort.

00:10:06.583 --> 00:10:09.958
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

00:10:12.167 --> 00:10:15.374
Now wear only one something,

00:10:16.625 --> 00:10:19.083
like a cloth tied round,

00:10:22.499 --> 00:10:29.125
and go and ask for alms from people.

00:10:35.291 --> 00:10:39.125
With these clothes also there's still problem,

00:10:39.416 --> 00:10:41.875
because you're attached to your cloth.

00:10:42.291 --> 00:10:45.499
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

00:10:45.875 --> 00:10:47.000
take out your clothes

00:10:47.249 --> 00:10:51.416
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.541
Then you'll get your nirvana.

00:10:53.875 --> 00:10:56.708
As it is you get nirvana.

00:10:59.875 --> 00:11:03.083
All such conditions were put

00:11:06.249 --> 00:11:11.625
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

00:11:13.958 --> 00:11:15.625
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

00:11:16.042 --> 00:11:20.875
You better work out your nirvana."

00:11:22.042 --> 00:11:26.958
The second thing was to destroy your mind

00:11:29.249 --> 00:11:32.291
which takes you to senses,

00:11:32.708 --> 00:11:35.750
to things of joy.

00:11:36.291 --> 00:11:40.416
Supposing you want to have some,

00:11:44.083 --> 00:11:46.374
something very much,

00:11:46.833 --> 00:11:50.958
so deny that, deny that.

00:11:51.583 --> 00:11:53.499
Anything that your mind tells you,

00:11:53.833 --> 00:11:56.583
just say "No, no, no" to it.

00:11:57.249 --> 00:11:59.833
In Sanskrit

00:12:01.917 --> 00:12:03.917
the shloka is like this,

00:12:04.208 --> 00:12:06.625
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

00:12:06.917 --> 00:12:08.000
- which you go on saying,

00:12:08.291 --> 00:12:12.208
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

00:12:12.833 --> 00:12:15.750
And then you can discuss about

00:12:16.083 --> 00:12:18.917
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

00:12:19.333 --> 00:12:24.708
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

00:12:26.917 --> 00:12:28.333
When I read this book I said,

00:12:28.583 --> 00:12:31.917
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

00:12:36.208 --> 00:12:39.125
But in Sahaja Yoga

00:12:40.708 --> 00:12:42.249
is the other way round,

00:12:42.541 --> 00:12:45.374
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

00:12:45.708 --> 00:12:48.374
and then the foundation.

00:12:49.249 --> 00:12:53.583
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

00:12:54.333 --> 00:12:57.458
And then in the light of Sahasrara

00:12:58.042 --> 00:13:01.208
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

00:13:02.374 --> 00:13:07.167
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

00:13:08.249 --> 00:13:10.917
through vibrations

00:13:12.249 --> 00:13:15.583
is to see why:

00:13:15.833 --> 00:13:18.042
why I want this?

00:13:18.374 --> 00:13:21.333
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

00:13:21.833 --> 00:13:24.207
Why my attention goes to food,

00:13:24.583 --> 00:13:27.708
why to my family, why to my children,

00:13:28.083 --> 00:13:31.333
when I have to achieve the highest?

00:13:31.833 --> 00:13:34.583
So you start introspecting yourself.

00:13:35.083 --> 00:13:38.167
Then you know on your vibrations also

00:13:38.458 --> 00:13:41.167
there's something wrong with you.

00:13:41.917 --> 00:13:44.833
Then you don't try to see others,

00:13:45.083 --> 00:13:48.207
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

00:13:48.499 --> 00:13:54.207
because it's your own ascent

00:13:54.917 --> 00:13:57.583
you have to achieve.

00:14:00.499 --> 00:14:03.249
But in the olden times,

00:14:04.249 --> 00:14:09.249
all these things were done individually.

00:14:10.499 --> 00:14:13.750
Like a one person who starts

00:14:14.249 --> 00:14:17.291
the path of nirvana,

00:14:21.167 --> 00:14:26.208
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

00:14:26.791 --> 00:14:28.958
stay away from people, avoid them,

00:14:29.249 --> 00:14:30.708
have nothing to do,

00:14:31.042 --> 00:14:34.958
and achieve this ascent,

00:14:35.917 --> 00:14:39.249
Self-realization, only for himself.

00:14:41.458 --> 00:14:44.042
It was not for others.

00:14:44.583 --> 00:14:48.249
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

00:14:48.833 --> 00:14:50.249
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

00:14:50.499 --> 00:14:52.583
he wouldn't meet anybody

00:14:53.083 --> 00:14:54.416
and he would sit somewhere

00:14:54.791 --> 00:14:59.291
on top of a remote mountain.

00:15:01.125 --> 00:15:03.125
Anybody who tried to meet him

00:15:03.333 --> 00:15:06.625
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

00:15:06.917 --> 00:15:09.625
and never meet that person.

00:15:13.458 --> 00:15:17.666
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

00:15:18.958 --> 00:15:22.291
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

00:15:25.625 --> 00:15:28.541
This kind of singular achievements

00:15:28.875 --> 00:15:31.541
did not lead people anywhere.

00:15:32.458 --> 00:15:36.416
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

00:15:36.791 --> 00:15:39.208
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

00:15:39.625 --> 00:15:43.416
about righteousness, about value system;

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:48.958
but they too were regarded as something strange,

00:15:49.791 --> 00:15:53.125
and were tortured and troubled.

00:15:55.333 --> 00:16:01.083
So on the level of an individual ascent,

00:16:01.666 --> 00:16:03.791
they couldn't do anything for others

00:16:04.125 --> 00:16:06.875
except for talking about it, telling about it,

00:16:07.207 --> 00:16:11.541
till Sahaja Yoga came.

00:16:12.125 --> 00:16:15.875
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

00:16:17.291 --> 00:16:21.541
Till the twelfth century in India

00:16:21.958 --> 00:16:25.416
nobody talked about it to the public.

00:16:27.083 --> 00:16:28.875
It was all in Sanskrit,

00:16:29.207 --> 00:16:32.000
very difficult Sanskrit books

00:16:32.416 --> 00:16:35.291
which were only available to few aspirants.

00:16:35.666 --> 00:16:38.625
Was explained to very, very few even,

00:16:39.333 --> 00:16:43.750
amounting to few numbers of people.

00:16:46.083 --> 00:16:51.000
But giving realization was denied.

00:16:52.291 --> 00:16:56.083
So only one master had one disciple,

00:16:56.958 --> 00:16:59.666
and all was the individual ascent,

00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:01.791
individual working out.

00:17:02.125 --> 00:17:04.416
Such a disciple was taken away from others

00:17:04.750 --> 00:17:06.958
and was kept in secret,

00:17:07.333 --> 00:17:09.249
worked it out on him;

00:17:09.374 --> 00:17:14.000
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

00:17:14.291 --> 00:17:17.000
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

00:17:17.374 --> 00:17:21.207
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

00:17:21.541 --> 00:17:24.249
neither he knew how to give realization.

00:17:26.416 --> 00:17:29.541
So now you see how far you have gone.

00:17:30.083 --> 00:17:32.541
You've got your realization

00:17:33.083 --> 00:17:35.750
without giving up much.

00:17:37.541 --> 00:17:41.000
You can work on a much wider scale,

00:17:41.499 --> 00:17:43.875
you can give realizations to other.

00:17:44.207 --> 00:17:47.750
You know about all the subtle knowledge

00:17:48.083 --> 00:17:51.958
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:54.499 --> 00:17:56.625
But today I'm going to tell you something more

00:17:57.042 --> 00:17:59.333
which we have to know.

00:18:01.249 --> 00:18:03.750
It's very important to know,

00:18:04.207 --> 00:18:08.917
because as was described by people

00:18:10.207 --> 00:18:14.917
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

00:18:16.458 --> 00:18:20.042
but it's not from their heart.

00:18:22.958 --> 00:18:26.167
And heart is the abode of the spirit

00:18:28.499 --> 00:18:32.333
- is the Shiva within us.

00:18:34.083 --> 00:18:36.958
So we have to know more about heart,

00:18:37.583 --> 00:18:41.333
and that is very important.

00:18:42.791 --> 00:18:45.666
You know about these three nadis we have:

00:18:46.125 --> 00:18:47.917
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

00:18:48.875 --> 00:18:52.000
but in the heart there are four nadis.

00:18:55.833 --> 00:19:00.167
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

00:19:03.374 --> 00:19:07.416
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

00:19:07.750 --> 00:19:12.083
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

00:19:12.541 --> 00:19:16.249
Actually you ask for your destruction.

00:19:18.249 --> 00:19:23.207
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

00:19:27.875 --> 00:19:31.750
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

00:19:32.374 --> 00:19:36.499
it's like when a fruit has to come,

00:19:36.917 --> 00:19:40.499
the petals look as if they're destroyed

00:19:40.833 --> 00:19:43.499
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

00:19:43.917 --> 00:19:46.458
you can call it like your conditionings,

00:19:46.750 --> 00:19:49.042
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

00:19:49.458 --> 00:19:52.499
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:52.958 --> 00:19:55.583
This has to be destroyed

00:19:56.083 --> 00:19:59.207
for the beauty to come out.

00:20:00.374 --> 00:20:06.499
So when your maryadas

00:20:06.958 --> 00:20:11.583
you cross beyond certain point,

00:20:12.458 --> 00:20:15.666
you go to your destruction.

00:20:18.708 --> 00:20:22.499
In four directions there are destructions built,

00:20:22.958 --> 00:20:25.833
as there are four nadis.

00:20:27.458 --> 00:20:30.125
So now, what is to be done?

00:20:31.167 --> 00:20:35.167
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

00:20:35.583 --> 00:20:38.917
through the first nadi, going to hell?

00:20:40.458 --> 00:20:44.917
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

00:20:45.833 --> 00:20:48.917
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

00:20:49.249 --> 00:20:52.333
He is innocence personified.

00:20:55.374 --> 00:20:58.541
So

00:21:00.291 --> 00:21:06.875
we have to put our carnal desires,

00:21:07.958 --> 00:21:10.833
dissolve them,

00:21:12.541 --> 00:21:17.374
dissolve them into the innocence,

00:21:17.750 --> 00:21:21.000
the ocean of innocence.

00:21:23.708 --> 00:21:28.291
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

00:21:30.541 --> 00:21:36.291
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

00:21:36.625 --> 00:21:40.833
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

00:21:41.249 --> 00:21:44.958
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

00:21:45.958 --> 00:21:50.708
you see children, they're innocent;

00:21:51.499 --> 00:21:53.708
flowers, they're innocent.

00:21:55.083 --> 00:21:59.000
Divert your attention

00:22:01.083 --> 00:22:03.833
to all these things.

00:22:08.208 --> 00:22:11.666
You see, on walking on the street,

00:22:12.249 --> 00:22:15.167
what is there to see best

00:22:15.499 --> 00:22:19.249
is all at three feet height.

00:22:20.708 --> 00:22:24.167
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

00:22:24.499 --> 00:22:26.499
all the beautiful grass,

00:22:26.917 --> 00:22:31.207
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

00:22:32.207 --> 00:22:35.833
You need not see people who are above that.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:42.458
Just see on three feet level.

00:22:45.958 --> 00:22:50.958
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

00:22:52.625 --> 00:22:55.833
But you don't see the eyes of a person

00:22:56.207 --> 00:22:59.083
who are not innocent.

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:03.541
So dissolve this desire

00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:07.708
into innocence.

00:23:09.125 --> 00:23:12.333
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

00:23:14.208 --> 00:23:17.917
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

00:23:19.249 --> 00:23:21.374
it is righteous,

00:23:21.791 --> 00:23:24.458
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

00:23:26.666 --> 00:23:28.791
it's pure.

00:23:29.167 --> 00:23:31.333
So even if you are in this world,

00:23:31.583 --> 00:23:34.000
even if you are living like a human being,

00:23:34.374 --> 00:23:36.791
even if you have children,

00:23:37.583 --> 00:23:40.666
still you are innocent.

00:23:42.583 --> 00:23:47.791
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:51.125
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

00:23:51.458 --> 00:23:53.416
and the five more.

00:23:53.833 --> 00:23:55.541
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

00:23:55.875 --> 00:23:58.708
and five were the elements.

00:24:01.416 --> 00:24:07.167
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

00:24:09.207 --> 00:24:13.708
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

00:24:14.083 --> 00:24:17.625
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

00:24:18.249 --> 00:24:21.625
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:26.207
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

00:24:26.958 --> 00:24:30.708
so flooded they could not cross over.

00:24:31.458 --> 00:24:33.042
They came back, they said,

00:24:33.333 --> 00:24:38.291
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

00:24:39.208 --> 00:24:40.541
So this Krishna said,

00:24:40.875 --> 00:24:42.666
"All right, you just go and say,

00:24:43.207 --> 00:24:47.416
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

00:24:48.167 --> 00:24:53.249
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

00:24:54.708 --> 00:24:57.000
you go down.'"

00:25:00.125 --> 00:25:01.833
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

00:25:02.167 --> 00:25:04.416
What is He talking about?"

00:25:05.875 --> 00:25:08.583
So they went down and said this to the river,

00:25:09.042 --> 00:25:11.708
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:16.333
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

00:25:20.291 --> 00:25:25.167
They went across and worshipped that rishi

00:25:26.207 --> 00:25:30.167
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

00:25:32.125 --> 00:25:33.875
So they went back to the rishi, said,

00:25:34.167 --> 00:25:36.583
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

00:25:37.042 --> 00:25:38.167
He said, "How did you come?"

00:25:38.416 --> 00:25:41.333
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:44.875
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

00:25:45.207 --> 00:25:48.000
and he had eaten such a lot.

00:25:48.416 --> 00:25:51.791
"All right, you go and tell this river that

00:25:52.125 --> 00:25:55.207
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

00:25:55.625 --> 00:25:57.750
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

00:25:58.167 --> 00:25:59.625
He said, "Just go and see."

00:25:59.958 --> 00:26:05.583
They went back and told this to the river.

00:26:07.499 --> 00:26:10.708
The river again went down.

00:26:13.416 --> 00:26:15.958
So to live in this world,

00:26:16.583 --> 00:26:18.958
to be a wife or to be a husband,

00:26:19.291 --> 00:26:24.416
to be married, whatever it is,

00:26:26.249 --> 00:26:29.042
you can be innocent,

00:26:29.625 --> 00:26:32.875
absolutely innocent about it.

00:26:33.416 --> 00:26:36.583
That's the sign of your purity.

00:26:39.875 --> 00:26:44.875
The second nadi, the second channel

00:26:45.291 --> 00:26:48.750
that can take you to destruction is desire.

00:26:49.833 --> 00:26:52.374
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

00:26:52.875 --> 00:26:56.499
is the only way that people do not get old,

00:26:56.875 --> 00:26:59.207
nor sick,

00:27:00.249 --> 00:27:03.083
nor worried.

00:27:06.833 --> 00:27:10.374
Now this desire that we have,

00:27:11.374 --> 00:27:13.167
"I want this,"

00:27:13.374 --> 00:27:16.708
in the West is much more than anywhere else

00:27:17.083 --> 00:27:19.207
because the entrepreneurs are every day

00:27:19.499 --> 00:27:21.750
producing new things.

00:27:22.167 --> 00:27:25.833
Say for example a hairdress,

00:27:26.207 --> 00:27:28.750
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

00:27:29.042 --> 00:27:32.249
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

00:27:32.708 --> 00:27:36.625
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

00:27:38.625 --> 00:27:44.708
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

00:27:45.083 --> 00:27:48.583
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

00:27:51.374 --> 00:27:54.833
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

00:27:56.750 --> 00:28:01.917
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

00:28:03.499 --> 00:28:07.833
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

00:28:08.291 --> 00:28:13.416
The desires could be also

00:28:13.875 --> 00:28:16.083
quite mental,

00:28:18.125 --> 00:28:20.958
"I must possess this woman,

00:28:21.416 --> 00:28:24.291
I must possess this child."

00:28:24.958 --> 00:28:29.625
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:34.416
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

00:28:36.416 --> 00:28:40.875
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

00:28:47.374 --> 00:28:54.083
Go on adding up things, getting things

00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.875
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

00:29:04.125 --> 00:29:06.416
What is the reason

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:12.042
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

00:29:12.917 --> 00:29:15.541
It's an impure desire.

00:29:16.208 --> 00:29:17.750
It's an impure desire,

00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.208
and when such a desire starts working

00:29:20.541 --> 00:29:22.541
you can go any far,

00:29:22.917 --> 00:29:25.333
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

00:29:25.583 --> 00:29:27.167
like anything is nothing

00:29:27.458 --> 00:29:32.000
but absolutely desire beyond

00:29:34.042 --> 00:29:36.917
any limitations.

00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:40.416
You want to dominate others

00:29:42.167 --> 00:29:44.791
is also another desire.

00:29:47.333 --> 00:29:49.458
All these desires

00:29:50.583 --> 00:29:54.333
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

00:29:56.541 --> 00:29:58.750
because there's no joy,

00:29:59.208 --> 00:30:01.291
there's no happiness.

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:09.458
For example, now I want to have a sari,

00:30:12.917 --> 00:30:15.583
so I want to buy a sari.

00:30:16.917 --> 00:30:19.458
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

00:30:19.791 --> 00:30:21.917
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

00:30:22.208 --> 00:30:27.000
The attention becomes polluted,

00:30:27.458 --> 00:30:31.583
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000
The attention which has to enjoy,

00:30:37.333 --> 00:30:40.666
which has to enjoy the spirit,

00:30:42.291 --> 00:30:44.875
which has to nourish the spirit,

00:30:45.208 --> 00:30:51.167
becomes disturbed because of desires.

00:30:53.042 --> 00:30:56.208
In the first place the attention

00:30:56.541 --> 00:31:00.416
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

00:31:01.666 --> 00:31:05.541
In the second place the attention

00:31:06.458 --> 00:31:10.750
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

00:31:15.583 --> 00:31:20.791
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

00:31:24.750 --> 00:31:27.541
The desire for beautiful things

00:31:29.666 --> 00:31:33.583
- we can shift our desire,

00:31:34.416 --> 00:31:37.208
material desire into aesthetics,

00:31:37.666 --> 00:31:42.167
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.875
because that's the quality of Shiva,

00:31:47.167 --> 00:31:50.875
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

00:31:51.208 --> 00:31:53.458
Now supposing this looks very plain,

00:31:53.750 --> 00:31:57.125
simple and one may say that mechanical.

00:31:57.666 --> 00:31:59.875
But if it was Shiva's job

00:32:00.167 --> 00:32:03.458
He would have done something beautiful about it.

00:32:05.167 --> 00:32:09.875
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

00:32:10.541 --> 00:32:14.125
that is created by Brahmadeva,

00:32:14.958 --> 00:32:18.125
evolved by Vishnu.

00:32:18.708 --> 00:32:21.750
He's the one who does

00:32:22.083 --> 00:32:25.125
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

00:32:25.583 --> 00:32:27.625
You've seen My photographs many a times

00:32:27.958 --> 00:32:32.167
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

00:32:32.499 --> 00:32:33.875
He's doing it.

00:32:34.207 --> 00:32:36.875
He throws lights in such a manner,

00:32:37.458 --> 00:32:39.750
He works out in such a manner.

00:32:40.167 --> 00:32:42.917
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

00:32:43.458 --> 00:32:44.750
It's His job.

00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:48.750
So His job is to create aesthetics:

00:32:50.625 --> 00:32:53.249
aesthetics of behavior,

00:32:54.125 --> 00:32:58.125
aesthetics of poetry.

00:33:00.958 --> 00:33:05.374
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

00:33:06.207 --> 00:33:10.625
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

00:33:13.541 --> 00:33:15.374
So whatever you desire,

00:33:15.666 --> 00:33:19.083
if you start working it out,

00:33:21.416 --> 00:33:27.416
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

00:33:31.833 --> 00:33:34.000
gradually you'll find

00:33:34.374 --> 00:33:36.750
you'll end up with vibrations,

00:33:37.249 --> 00:33:40.708
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.541
And to have the vibrations

00:33:44.875 --> 00:33:48.000
you'll have to go to pure desire.

00:33:49.625 --> 00:33:52.416
So this desire which is madness,

00:33:52.833 --> 00:33:55.083
which makes you mad,

00:33:55.499 --> 00:34:01.083
which is so much dull and boring

00:34:02.499 --> 00:34:06.958
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

00:34:07.333 --> 00:34:09.499
all your desires into vibration.

00:34:09.750 --> 00:34:13.708
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

00:34:15.917 --> 00:34:18.917
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

00:34:19.374 --> 00:34:22.499
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

00:34:23.249 --> 00:34:26.833
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

00:34:33.083 --> 00:34:36.125
I've seen people running away

00:34:36.458 --> 00:34:38.208
from some people

00:34:38.499 --> 00:34:42.666
as if some monkey is after them.

00:34:42.958 --> 00:34:44.083
When I look around,

00:34:44.374 --> 00:34:45.958
I find there are people who are drunkard,

00:34:46.208 --> 00:34:48.458
or somebody coming or something.

00:34:48.917 --> 00:34:52.083
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

00:34:52.583 --> 00:34:53.791
but now they run away,

00:34:54.125 --> 00:34:58.167
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

00:35:00.249 --> 00:35:02.666
We had three, four hippies to begin

00:35:03.042 --> 00:35:05.125
with who came with Me to India.

00:35:05.374 --> 00:35:07.249
They're normal like you, they were become,

00:35:07.583 --> 00:35:09.207
you see, Sahaja yogis.

00:35:09.499 --> 00:35:13.416
And four, five hippies came to My program,

00:35:13.750 --> 00:35:15.708
it was in Rahuri, I think.

00:35:16.083 --> 00:35:20.374
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

00:35:20.625 --> 00:35:22.083
I said, "What's the matter with you?

00:35:22.291 --> 00:35:24.000
Why are you so frightened?"

00:35:24.291 --> 00:35:26.249
So I turned round to see these hippies,

00:35:26.541 --> 00:35:29.499
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

00:35:30.625 --> 00:35:33.125
They were no more there.

00:35:34.958 --> 00:35:39.833
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

00:35:40.416 --> 00:35:42.541
into vibrations.

00:35:42.833 --> 00:35:43.917
And if it does not,

00:35:44.208 --> 00:35:46.374
then you must know there's something still missing.

00:35:46.708 --> 00:35:49.666
But if you do not do this,

00:35:50.833 --> 00:35:54.167
then you end up into your destruction.

00:35:55.374 --> 00:35:59.000
So to say that He's a destroyer

00:35:59.333 --> 00:36:03.708
is a very one-sided statement.

00:36:05.917 --> 00:36:08.208
He has both the powers.

00:36:08.666 --> 00:36:12.416
He has the power to give you vibrations.

00:36:13.167 --> 00:36:16.000
He gives you vibrations.

00:36:20.208 --> 00:36:24.333
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

00:36:25.208 --> 00:36:27.125
but He makes the vibrations.

00:36:27.333 --> 00:36:30.249
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

00:36:31.167 --> 00:36:35.249
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

00:36:38.666 --> 00:36:41.125
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

00:36:41.374 --> 00:36:45.208
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

00:36:45.583 --> 00:36:50.167
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

00:36:51.458 --> 00:36:55.208
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

00:36:57.333 --> 00:37:00.000
Today only I was explaining

00:37:00.333 --> 00:37:03.458
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.625
and has done so much study of bhakti

00:37:06.958 --> 00:37:08.958
and all that and knew so much,

00:37:09.208 --> 00:37:13.416
just merged into Me.

00:37:13.458 --> 00:37:16.333
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

00:37:16.833 --> 00:37:18.458
because normally people don't do.

00:37:18.708 --> 00:37:20.583
When they are reading about Devi they think,

00:37:20.833 --> 00:37:22.374
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

00:37:22.625 --> 00:37:24.499
You see, it's separate things.

00:37:24.750 --> 00:37:27.958
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

00:37:29.499 --> 00:37:31.833
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

00:37:32.167 --> 00:37:35.083
It's written that how You are gentle,

00:37:35.458 --> 00:37:38.083
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

00:37:38.458 --> 00:37:40.167
how She looks after me,

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.833
how Her attention is on me."

00:37:43.249 --> 00:37:46.958
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

00:37:47.207 --> 00:37:49.583
every glance is an inspection."

00:37:49.958 --> 00:37:51.833
But "inspection" not a very good word,

00:37:52.167 --> 00:37:55.708
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

00:37:58.333 --> 00:38:00.708
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

00:38:01.042 --> 00:38:04.458
You are all the time - when I listen to music

00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:07.875
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

00:38:08.291 --> 00:38:11.791
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

00:38:12.333 --> 00:38:15.583
All the time I feel Your love."

00:38:17.666 --> 00:38:19.917
That's how the bhakti comes in.

00:38:20.333 --> 00:38:21.666
So if you have vibrations

00:38:22.042 --> 00:38:26.249
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

00:38:27.499 --> 00:38:29.583
No,

00:38:29.917 --> 00:38:33.917
it means the joy of bhakti.

00:38:36.583 --> 00:38:40.167
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

00:38:40.458 --> 00:38:45.499
It's the ocean of love that is God.

00:38:46.499 --> 00:38:48.207
You just get drenched into it.

00:38:48.499 --> 00:38:50.958
There's no words to it.

00:38:55.207 --> 00:38:57.167
And that is what when you feel,

00:38:57.374 --> 00:38:59.750
you must know that

00:39:00.458 --> 00:39:04.458
you have taken the spirit

00:39:05.917 --> 00:39:10.042
as a real connection

00:39:11.458 --> 00:39:14.708
between you and your Mother,

00:39:15.833 --> 00:39:18.374
or your Father.

00:39:20.333 --> 00:39:25.833
There's no differentiation.

00:39:28.249 --> 00:39:31.583
You are one

00:39:31.833 --> 00:39:34.583
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

00:39:34.958 --> 00:39:37.625
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

00:39:38.167 --> 00:39:41.207
You are one in that bhakti.

00:39:42.207 --> 00:39:46.207
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

00:39:49.499 --> 00:39:52.249
because not man-made.

00:39:55.583 --> 00:40:00.207
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

00:40:01.499 --> 00:40:05.499
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

00:40:06.167 --> 00:40:08.833
but is the bhakti.

00:40:09.666 --> 00:40:12.125
That is the joy

00:40:12.750 --> 00:40:14.750
of Shiva's quality,

00:40:15.125 --> 00:40:18.541
the quality of joy that He adds

00:40:19.208 --> 00:40:22.083
to our life.

00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.958
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

00:40:27.208 --> 00:40:29.291
Same thing the joy,

00:40:29.625 --> 00:40:32.291
that "I'm loved so much by God,

00:40:32.708 --> 00:40:34.750
that God loves me,

00:40:35.083 --> 00:40:38.000
that I have a meaning in life."

00:40:39.499 --> 00:40:44.499
Then the ego drops out first of all,

00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:51.541
and also the conditionings drop out.

00:40:55.499 --> 00:40:58.499
Now the third nadi:

00:41:04.208 --> 00:41:07.208
third nadi

00:41:07.750 --> 00:41:11.666
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

00:41:13.666 --> 00:41:15.666
attached to someone.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:20.333
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

00:41:20.917 --> 00:41:23.042
this is my family,

00:41:23.333 --> 00:41:25.583
this is my wife,

00:41:26.291 --> 00:41:29.750
this is my father, this is my mother.

00:41:32.167 --> 00:41:35.791
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

00:41:36.167 --> 00:41:39.291
when they are just the beginners,

00:41:39.875 --> 00:41:44.208
so they talk about their whole family,

00:41:45.458 --> 00:41:46.917
"My father is like this,

00:41:47.208 --> 00:41:50.167
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

00:41:50.458 --> 00:41:55.416
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

00:41:56.208 --> 00:42:00.791
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

00:42:02.791 --> 00:42:05.666
What should I do?

00:42:07.374 --> 00:42:11.625
Like today somebody said that "You see,

00:42:12.958 --> 00:42:14.958
they lost their first child.

00:42:15.333 --> 00:42:17.416
First child they lost,

00:42:18.249 --> 00:42:21.125
because the child was sleeping in another room."

00:42:21.333 --> 00:42:25.167
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

00:42:25.416 --> 00:42:27.333
and mother must look after the children."

00:42:27.499 --> 00:42:28.875
It's simple thing - I mean,

00:42:29.207 --> 00:42:31.708
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

00:42:31.875 --> 00:42:33.541
She'll throw away the husband,

00:42:33.875 --> 00:42:37.083
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

00:42:37.416 --> 00:42:42.125
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

00:42:43.541 --> 00:42:44.875
But they don't believe in it.

00:42:45.125 --> 00:42:47.291
So all right - what can we do?

00:42:47.541 --> 00:42:50.416
Have we taken their contract that

00:42:50.750 --> 00:42:52.666
we should look after their children,

00:42:53.083 --> 00:42:56.291
even when they don't want to listen to us?

00:42:57.125 --> 00:43:03.207
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

00:43:03.499 --> 00:43:07.499
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

00:43:07.833 --> 00:43:12.625
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

00:43:13.625 --> 00:43:16.541
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

00:43:18.207 --> 00:43:21.416
as if I've let them down.

00:43:24.416 --> 00:43:26.083
But they don't want to see that

00:43:26.291 --> 00:43:28.499
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:43:28.833 --> 00:43:31.125
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

00:43:31.374 --> 00:43:34.207
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

00:43:34.625 --> 00:43:37.083
Something missing, you don't deserve.

00:43:37.374 --> 00:43:40.374
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

00:43:40.833 --> 00:43:44.374
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

00:43:44.833 --> 00:43:48.958
is something which has got the contract.

00:43:49.458 --> 00:43:50.708
Immediately they'll inform you,

00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.042
"Now somebody is sick there,

00:43:52.249 --> 00:43:54.125
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

00:43:54.416 --> 00:43:59.333
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

00:44:02.458 --> 00:44:06.458
These attachments start working within us.

00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:09.958
Now some people I've seen

00:44:10.833 --> 00:44:14.291
are very attached to their children

00:44:15.083 --> 00:44:21.249
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.249
And suddenly they discover

00:44:23.499 --> 00:44:27.042
the child is now is a devil's child.

00:44:28.458 --> 00:44:30.249
The child starts answering back,

00:44:30.583 --> 00:44:33.249
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

00:44:33.583 --> 00:44:36.666
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

00:44:37.125 --> 00:44:40.208
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

00:44:40.458 --> 00:44:41.541
giving so much love."

00:44:41.833 --> 00:44:43.458
And they feel even worse,

00:44:43.791 --> 00:44:47.208
because "I have done so much for my wife,

00:44:47.541 --> 00:44:48.708
and she is treating me like this."

00:44:49.042 --> 00:44:51.249
"I've done so much for my husband,

00:44:51.583 --> 00:44:52.791
and he is treating me like this."

00:44:53.125 --> 00:44:54.666
Why do you do so much?

00:44:54.917 --> 00:44:56.374
There's no need.

00:44:56.708 --> 00:45:00.791
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

00:45:01.917 --> 00:45:03.208
I never feel that way.

00:45:03.583 --> 00:45:06.167
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

00:45:06.458 --> 00:45:08.125
and they have gone down.

00:45:08.458 --> 00:45:09.666
Only thing if I feel anything,

00:45:09.958 --> 00:45:11.708
only God knows where will they jump?

00:45:11.917 --> 00:45:13.541
Where will they be in hell?

00:45:13.791 --> 00:45:16.541
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

00:45:16.917 --> 00:45:18.541
Not the concern what has happened,

00:45:18.791 --> 00:45:21.207
because nothing can \happen to Me.

00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:26.042
But if they have been sinful

00:45:26.458 --> 00:45:30.917
I just get worried about their future,

00:45:31.291 --> 00:45:34.333
about their lives. That's different.

00:45:34.791 --> 00:45:37.333
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

00:45:37.666 --> 00:45:40.208
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

00:45:40.541 --> 00:45:43.666
my this thing, my that."

00:45:46.333 --> 00:45:50.208
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

00:45:50.541 --> 00:45:52.291
It's a sentence you must remember,

00:45:52.625 --> 00:45:55.666
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

00:45:56.042 --> 00:46:00.416
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

00:46:00.750 --> 00:46:03.625
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

00:46:03.917 --> 00:46:07.458
could be my own child - is not mine."

00:46:08.875 --> 00:46:12.333
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

00:46:13.042 --> 00:46:16.208
This relationship is all right till

00:46:16.666 --> 00:46:20.666
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.666
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

00:46:26.125 --> 00:46:28.207
then I'm not with that person.

00:46:28.416 --> 00:46:29.917
I've seen there are many like that,

00:46:30.208 --> 00:46:31.750
but very good Sahaja yogis.

00:46:32.083 --> 00:46:33.458
They'll never side with their wives,

00:46:33.750 --> 00:46:35.791
never side with their children,

00:46:36.208 --> 00:46:39.416
because they know if you are siding with them

00:46:39.750 --> 00:46:44.791
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

00:46:45.291 --> 00:46:46.875
They're worried about their ascent

00:46:47.207 --> 00:46:50.208
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

00:46:50.625 --> 00:46:54.207
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

00:46:55.875 --> 00:46:58.083
I have seen some children

00:46:58.666 --> 00:47:01.083
who are extremely naughty,

00:47:01.333 --> 00:47:04.208
they're very troublesome, very violent,

00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:07.208
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

00:47:07.541 --> 00:47:10.541
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

00:47:10.875 --> 00:47:11.917
But others will say,

00:47:12.207 --> 00:47:14.666
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

00:47:15.083 --> 00:47:18.416
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:26.083
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

00:47:26.458 --> 00:47:30.083
that "Why am I attached?"

00:47:31.416 --> 00:47:33.207
I've given this simile many a times,

00:47:33.458 --> 00:47:35.291
like the sap of the tree rises,

00:47:35.625 --> 00:47:39.083
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

00:47:39.291 --> 00:47:42.625
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

00:47:42.917 --> 00:47:44.791
looks after the leaves,

00:47:45.042 --> 00:47:46.833
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

00:47:47.208 --> 00:47:50.249
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.249
If it gets involved into one of them

00:47:53.583 --> 00:47:54.833
the whole tree will die,

00:47:55.167 --> 00:47:58.167
and that part which

00:47:58.541 --> 00:48:03.374
is so close to the sap will also die.

00:48:03.666 --> 00:48:07.000
But sap has much more sense than we have.

00:48:11.875 --> 00:48:13.625
To them, husband's so important

00:48:13.875 --> 00:48:17.083
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

00:48:17.374 --> 00:48:20.499
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

00:48:20.791 --> 00:48:23.499
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

00:48:23.791 --> 00:48:25.416
- so nobody can talk about wife,

00:48:25.750 --> 00:48:27.000
children, nothing.

00:48:27.208 --> 00:48:31.208
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

00:48:31.625 --> 00:48:32.917
So no headache to the guru.

00:48:33.291 --> 00:48:34.666
As soon as you start talking

00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:37.625
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

00:48:37.917 --> 00:48:41.625
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

00:48:44.042 --> 00:48:47.167
But in Sahaja Yoga -

00:48:47.458 --> 00:48:51.458
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

00:48:52.208 --> 00:48:53.666
work to do.

00:48:53.917 --> 00:48:55.833
It has to penetrate into the society,

00:48:56.125 --> 00:48:58.125
into the political life, into economic life.

00:48:58.249 --> 00:49:00.207
You have to emancipate the whole world.

00:49:00.499 --> 00:49:02.750
Try to understand your responsibility.

00:49:04.208 --> 00:49:09.167
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

00:49:12.666 --> 00:49:14.666
How much wisdom you must have,

00:49:15.125 --> 00:49:16.917
how much love you must have,

00:49:17.458 --> 00:49:20.416
and how much discrimination you must have,

00:49:20.708 --> 00:49:22.374
to understand that you are chosen

00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:25.708
for the emancipation of the whole world.

00:49:29.583 --> 00:49:33.333
So now this so-called limited love,

00:49:33.833 --> 00:49:37.000
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

00:49:37.333 --> 00:49:40.458
is the unlimited love.

00:49:41.708 --> 00:49:46.917
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

00:49:50.374 --> 00:49:55.791
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

00:49:57.458 --> 00:50:00.708
that wants your benevolence.

00:50:02.208 --> 00:50:03.917
That's what Shiva is.

00:50:04.208 --> 00:50:07.249
It wants your benevolence.

00:50:09.042 --> 00:50:12.333
It looks after your benevolence.

00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:17.042
So when

00:50:18.125 --> 00:50:23.167
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

00:50:26.042 --> 00:50:29.541
then the whole life changes,

00:50:31.791 --> 00:50:34.708
the whole pattern changes,

00:50:35.458 --> 00:50:37.666
and you really enjoy it because

00:50:38.042 --> 00:50:40.208
you become one with so many,

00:50:40.583 --> 00:50:43.374
concerned with so many families, so many things,

00:50:43.791 --> 00:50:48.083
so many problems of others,

00:50:48.541 --> 00:50:51.207
and you just feel you are one with so many.

00:50:51.541 --> 00:50:55.000
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

00:50:55.458 --> 00:50:58.083
First time when I came to Italy,

00:50:58.291 --> 00:51:00.917
I must tell you,

00:51:01.541 --> 00:51:04.541
I came with Christine - no,

00:51:04.875 --> 00:51:08.416
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

00:51:08.958 --> 00:51:11.875
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

00:51:12.249 --> 00:51:14.083
And we had told some newspaper

00:51:14.416 --> 00:51:17.625
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

00:51:17.958 --> 00:51:19.416
Nothing was done.

00:51:19.750 --> 00:51:22.625
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.207
So I went round with her to put the posters,

00:51:26.541 --> 00:51:29.249
but still nobody came.

00:51:29.833 --> 00:51:32.125
And today we are so many.

00:51:32.499 --> 00:51:36.833
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

00:51:40.083 --> 00:51:45.541
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

00:51:47.625 --> 00:51:51.833
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.291
And then you don't think what race you are,

00:51:55.541 --> 00:51:57.541
what country you are, what this thing you are,

00:51:57.791 --> 00:51:59.875
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

00:52:00.207 --> 00:52:03.791
So you become a universal being.

00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.750
And this attitude has to be achieved.

00:52:08.207 --> 00:52:10.333
When I hear that some Indian girls

00:52:10.750 --> 00:52:14.666
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

00:52:15.125 --> 00:52:19.208
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

00:52:19.708 --> 00:52:22.374
or some Indians are treating somebody

00:52:22.791 --> 00:52:24.917
because they are of low caste.

00:52:25.249 --> 00:52:27.042
It's not possible,

00:52:27.333 --> 00:52:30.249
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

00:52:30.583 --> 00:52:35.499
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

00:52:36.208 --> 00:52:38.374
But this is only possible

00:52:38.791 --> 00:52:42.666
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

00:52:43.042 --> 00:52:45.833
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

00:52:46.208 --> 00:52:48.208
then only it is possible.

00:52:48.666 --> 00:52:51.458
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

00:52:51.833 --> 00:52:54.208
- just watch yourself.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:53:00.249
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

00:53:01.791 --> 00:53:05.666
You see, I would say that

00:53:06.791 --> 00:53:09.541
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

00:53:09.791 --> 00:53:13.167
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

00:53:13.458 --> 00:53:15.917
that will be nice for that one."

00:53:16.208 --> 00:53:18.125
For Myself if you say,

00:53:18.458 --> 00:53:20.833
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

00:53:21.125 --> 00:53:24.541
impossible situation.

00:53:26.208 --> 00:53:28.833
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

00:53:29.458 --> 00:53:33.125
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

00:53:33.416 --> 00:53:36.167
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

00:53:36.416 --> 00:53:37.875
even if I am thirsty.

00:53:38.249 --> 00:53:41.207
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

00:53:41.583 --> 00:53:44.167
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

00:53:44.291 --> 00:53:47.042
This will be good for that person."

00:53:51.207 --> 00:53:55.958
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

00:53:56.207 --> 00:53:59.291
I mean, why all this is for there?

00:53:59.750 --> 00:54:01.499
After all, think about yourself,

00:54:01.875 --> 00:54:04.750
"Why am I here?

00:54:07.167 --> 00:54:10.708
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

00:54:11.249 --> 00:54:14.083
They are all realized souls,

00:54:14.750 --> 00:54:17.958
such beautiful lotuses.

00:54:18.708 --> 00:54:22.583
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

00:54:22.958 --> 00:54:25.958
Now I am a lotus."

00:54:28.833 --> 00:54:34.291
That is the way you open the heart,

00:54:36.499 --> 00:54:39.167
the lotus of your heart.

00:54:39.499 --> 00:54:44.207
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

00:54:45.416 --> 00:54:49.750
is so beautiful.

00:54:51.750 --> 00:54:54.291
So you are no more divisive,

00:54:54.708 --> 00:54:57.042
you do not want to separate from each other.

00:54:57.291 --> 00:55:01.625
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

00:55:01.958 --> 00:55:03.750
you don't think that it should be done here

00:55:04.083 --> 00:55:06.167
or there or there, but anywhere

00:55:06.374 --> 00:55:10.958
- but should be all of us together.

00:55:12.583 --> 00:55:17.167
So the small attachments that are with you

00:55:17.958 --> 00:55:21.416
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

00:55:21.750 --> 00:55:25.249
which is Shiva.

00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:34.291
Fourth one is the most important

00:55:34.833 --> 00:55:37.083
for all of us is to know

00:55:37.416 --> 00:55:41.291
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

00:55:42.666 --> 00:55:44.499
into the heart.

00:55:44.750 --> 00:55:48.083
Starts from the heart, goes up,

00:55:48.875 --> 00:55:50.958
passes through Agnya.

00:55:51.291 --> 00:55:55.000
It has four petals, and opens up.

00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.083
This is the one which gives

00:56:03.708 --> 00:56:07.499
you the state which is called as turya.

00:56:07.875 --> 00:56:11.958
We live in three states.

00:56:12.249 --> 00:56:15.750
In the living - in the awakened state,

00:56:16.083 --> 00:56:20.167
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

00:56:20.374 --> 00:56:22.958
we spoil our attention.

00:56:25.499 --> 00:56:29.833
But the second one is the one what we call

00:56:30.167 --> 00:56:31.875
is that we sleep.

00:56:32.083 --> 00:56:35.833
When we sleep also

00:56:36.791 --> 00:56:38.333
all these things that have happened

00:56:38.625 --> 00:56:41.499
come to us from our past and things like that.

00:56:43.625 --> 00:56:47.499
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

00:56:49.167 --> 00:56:52.708
Is a state where

00:56:53.625 --> 00:56:55.958
you have deep sleep,

00:56:56.249 --> 00:57:00.042
and you dream of something that is reality also.

00:57:01.042 --> 00:57:04.167
You may dream about Me.

00:57:05.042 --> 00:57:09.249
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

00:57:09.708 --> 00:57:13.917
where some beautiful

00:57:14.249 --> 00:57:15.958
informations are passed on.

00:57:16.208 --> 00:57:18.458
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

00:57:18.708 --> 00:57:20.583
Italians might know in their sushupti

00:57:20.917 --> 00:57:23.374
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

00:57:23.708 --> 00:57:25.374
- depends on.

00:57:25.708 --> 00:57:27.583
But the fourth state is called as turya.

00:57:27.833 --> 00:57:29.167
There are two more states.

00:57:29.458 --> 00:57:31.333
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

00:57:31.666 --> 00:57:33.374
"turya" means fourth.

00:57:33.791 --> 00:57:37.458
Fourth state is where that you are

00:57:37.833 --> 00:57:40.917
in a thoughtless awareness state.

00:57:42.541 --> 00:57:47.374
When there is no thought - just think of it

00:57:48.374 --> 00:57:52.458
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

00:57:53.333 --> 00:57:57.833
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

00:57:58.791 --> 00:58:02.708
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

00:58:03.708 --> 00:58:06.125
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

00:58:06.374 --> 00:58:08.042
is the "turya sthiti."

00:58:08.333 --> 00:58:12.042
And in this state when you are,

00:58:13.833 --> 00:58:18.125
these four petals which are within you

00:58:18.666 --> 00:58:22.458
have to open out in your brain.

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:27.666
They come from your heart to your brain.

00:58:30.917 --> 00:58:35.833
And that is when

00:58:38.333 --> 00:58:44.042
you absolutely understand what is God,

00:58:49.125 --> 00:58:53.958
absolutely you know what is God is.

00:58:56.042 --> 00:59:00.416
That is the time when

00:59:03.249 --> 00:59:07.499
one receives the real knowledge.

00:59:14.042 --> 00:59:17.083
But unless and until these four petals open,

00:59:17.374 --> 00:59:19.207
one may fall back,

00:59:19.625 --> 00:59:22.291
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

00:59:22.750 --> 00:59:27.291
who are still meddling with things

00:59:27.833 --> 00:59:31.042
that they should not do, go down.

00:59:31.708 --> 00:59:36.416
And they don't understand what is God is.

00:59:38.207 --> 00:59:40.249
But it's not the understanding

00:59:40.583 --> 00:59:42.416
- in a way you understand this one little point,

00:59:42.833 --> 00:59:46.625
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

00:59:47.167 --> 00:59:50.583
not from brain to your heart.

00:59:52.958 --> 00:59:55.875
It comes

00:59:56.249 --> 00:59:59.499
as if the ambrosia of

00:59:59.791 --> 01:00:04.042
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:07.791
Say for example,

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:11.125
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:12.750
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:15.666
where he described what is God, this, that;

01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:18.416
and "viveka" means the conscience,

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:22.541
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

01:00:23.917 --> 01:00:26.125
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:29.583
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.333
Shankaracharya.

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.917
He said, "No use talking to them."

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:37.042
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

01:00:37.374 --> 01:00:40.207
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:41.249
praising the Mother.

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:43.875
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:47.750
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:50.291
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:55.207
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

01:00:55.499 --> 01:01:00.083
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:05.833
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:08.708
And if that is God,

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:12.249
then how can you suspect anything,

01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:15.583
how can you

01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:18.541
try to analyze anything?

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:22.541
It's God. It's God Almighty,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.249
which knows everything,

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:27.666
which does everything,

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:30.833
which enjoys everything.

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:35.208
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:37.249
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:38.666
the pure knowledge.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.208
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:43.583
not the knowledge of vibrations,

01:01:44.042 --> 01:01:45.833
not the knowledge of kundalini,

01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:50.583
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:54.666
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.207
Again I tell you,

01:01:56.416 --> 01:02:00.958
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:08.416
something that comes out of your experience of joy

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:10.125
and covers your brain.

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:13.000
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:16.208
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:19.666
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.207
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:24.958
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:28.083
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

01:02:28.499 --> 01:02:30.207
The knowledge about your mother,

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:32.958
the one who has given you birth;

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:36.833
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

01:02:37.207 --> 01:02:39.541
But knowledge about God,

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.125
that He's love, that He's truth,

01:02:42.499 --> 01:02:44.249
that He knows everything,

01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:49.750
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:54.708
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.499
So it's important,

01:02:58.833 --> 01:03:01.750
specially for the people of the West,

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:04.207
now open your hearts,

01:03:04.499 --> 01:03:08.625
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.499
Do not judge people on vibrations.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:19.374
Judge yourself, all the time.

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:24.833
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:27.125
more understanding, more this thing;

01:03:27.416 --> 01:03:33.291
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:40.208
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:43.499
it's God.

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:47.958
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:53.791
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:57.458
She may be anything, but I know Her.

01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.583
It cannot be described in one book,

01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:02.499
it cannot be described in hundred books.

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.917
It cannot be described in words,

01:04:06.249 --> 01:04:10.833
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:14.125
God Almighty.

01:04:16.416 --> 01:04:19.207
And that gives you

01:04:19.499 --> 01:04:23.083
that beautiful surrender,

01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:27.291
where you just feel absolutely secured

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:32.750
in that ocean of love.

01:04:33.541 --> 01:04:36.208
I wish you all to achieve that state.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:40.666
May God bless you.
