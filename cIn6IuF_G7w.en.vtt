WEBVTT

05:23.125 --> 05:26.666
Today we have assembled here

05:27.125 --> 05:31.875
to worship Sadashiva,

05:32.167 --> 05:38.458
which is reflected within us as Shiva, as the spirit.

05:42.666 --> 05:45.791
He is reflected in our heart,

05:47.791 --> 05:53.541
and as you have seen

05:55.000 --> 06:01.291
that the goal of our life

06:02.917 --> 06:08.917
was to achieve this state of spirit.

06:13.917 --> 06:17.708
The other day I was reading some books

06:19.458 --> 06:24.541
how it was done,

06:28.708 --> 06:33.249
this Self-realization, to know the spirit,

06:33.958 --> 06:38.708
and how people were tortured.

06:40.207 --> 06:45.625
First of all they're asked to

06:47.958 --> 06:53.791
somehow or other deny, defy and condemn their body.

06:56.333 --> 07:00.958
Now, if the body wants to have comfort,

07:02.207 --> 07:10.750
then it was said that first try to sleep on the carpet,

07:11.167 --> 07:13.917
not on the bed.

07:15.042 --> 07:18.833
Then still, it's not enough;

07:19.333 --> 07:22.333
then from the carpet you go to a mat

07:23.708 --> 07:25.499
still is not enough.

07:25.833 --> 07:29.167
Then from that maybe,

07:30.583 --> 07:33.249
you move down

07:34.291 --> 07:38.125
to the Mother Earth,

07:38.416 --> 07:40.541
sleep on the Mother Earth.

07:41.374 --> 07:45.249
Still if the body is not all right

07:45.499 --> 07:49.833
then you start sleeping on the stone.

07:50.374 --> 07:54.083
But still the Himalayas are far away,

07:54.833 --> 07:57.291
because Shiva resides in Kailasha.

07:57.625 --> 08:02.291
So you go to Himalayas and sleep on the ice.

08:02.625 --> 08:07.125
This was the minimum requirement.

08:08.416 --> 08:15.833
Then it was said that you are fond of good food,

08:18.083 --> 08:20.499
you want to have sumptuous food,

08:20.833 --> 08:23.750
you eat a lot, all right;

08:24.374 --> 08:27.875
so you deny everything that you like, to begin with,

08:28.207 --> 08:30.000
all that you like.

08:30.416 --> 08:33.666
For example, Italians cannot eat pasta!

08:39.291 --> 08:43.875
Then deny that.

08:45.499 --> 08:48.042
But that's not sufficient.

08:48.499 --> 08:51.750
After that you start eating things

08:52.458 --> 08:54.499
which are very bitter.

08:54.833 --> 08:58.249
As in the Zen system they give you to eat

08:58.583 --> 09:02.291
something which is like quinine raised to power 108,

09:02.625 --> 09:07.416
absolutely bitter - or absolutely sweet.

09:07.750 --> 09:11.167
So put your tongue into test.

09:12.625 --> 09:15.458
But still the stomach is there.

09:15.750 --> 09:18.458
So if you are eating too much,

09:18.750 --> 09:22.374
you fast for one day. That's not sufficient.

09:22.750 --> 09:24.708
Then fast for seven days.

09:25.042 --> 09:26.833
Then for forty days.

09:27.207 --> 09:31.583
I mean, a month has got only thirty days;

09:31.875 --> 09:34.833
to fast for forty days means you are already finished.

09:35.167 --> 09:40.042
That's how if you have to do your penance for nirvana.

09:40.291 --> 09:41.750
As it is you get a nirvana

09:42.083 --> 09:44.249
because you're finished and dead, you see,

09:44.625 --> 09:49.042
nothing is left out of you, nothing but bones,

09:49.291 --> 09:53.207
and these bones then become nirvana.

09:53.666 --> 09:55.541
Ultimately the death follows,

09:55.875 --> 09:57.291
so you are finished and there is nirvana,

09:57.541 --> 09:59.875
no doubt about it.

10:02.042 --> 10:04.167
Then you don't live in a house,

10:04.499 --> 10:06.249
because house is comfort.

10:06.583 --> 10:09.958
Give up your wife, give up your children, give up everyone.

10:12.167 --> 10:15.374
Now wear only one something,

10:16.625 --> 10:19.083
like a cloth tied round,

10:22.499 --> 10:29.125
and go and ask for alms from people.

10:35.291 --> 10:39.125
With these clothes also there's still problem,

10:39.416 --> 10:41.875
because you're attached to your cloth.

10:42.291 --> 10:45.499
So you go to Himalayas where there's nobody to see you,

10:45.875 --> 10:47.000
take out your clothes

10:47.249 --> 10:51.416
and in that cold you stay there, completely shaking.

10:52.000 --> 10:53.541
Then you'll get your nirvana.

10:53.875 --> 10:56.708
As it is you get nirvana.

10:59.875 --> 11:03.083
All such conditions were put

11:06.249 --> 11:11.625
as to destroy the demands of your body to begin with.

11:13.958 --> 11:15.625
You tell your body, "No, nothing doing.

11:16.042 --> 11:20.875
You better work out your nirvana."

11:22.042 --> 11:26.958
The second thing was to destroy your mind

11:29.249 --> 11:32.291
which takes you to senses,

11:32.708 --> 11:35.750
to things of joy.

11:36.291 --> 11:40.416
Supposing you want to have some,

11:44.083 --> 11:46.374
something very much,

11:46.833 --> 11:50.958
so deny that, deny that.

11:51.583 --> 11:53.499
Anything that your mind tells you,

11:53.833 --> 11:56.583
just say "No, no, no" to it.

11:57.249 --> 11:59.833
In Sanskrit

12:01.917 --> 12:03.917
the shloka is like this,

12:04.208 --> 12:06.625
"Yat neti neti vachane, nigamo vacha"

12:06.917 --> 12:08.000
- which you go on saying,

12:08.291 --> 12:12.208
"neti, neti": "No, not this, not this, not this, not this."

12:12.833 --> 12:15.750
And then you can discuss about

12:16.083 --> 12:18.917
- discuss only, yes - nirvana.

12:19.333 --> 12:24.708
Before that you are not even worthy of discussion of nirvana.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.333
When I read this book I said,

12:28.583 --> 12:31.917
"Baba, I give up. It's too much."

12:36.208 --> 12:39.125
But in Sahaja Yoga

12:40.708 --> 12:42.249
is the other way round,

12:42.541 --> 12:45.374
like building first the pinnacle of the building,

12:45.708 --> 12:48.374
and then the foundation.

12:49.249 --> 12:53.583
Opening your Sahasrara was the first thing was achieved.

12:54.333 --> 12:57.458
And then in the light of Sahasrara

12:58.042 --> 13:01.208
you have to watch yourself and see for yourself.

13:02.374 --> 13:07.167
Gradually the introspection was a better thing,

13:08.249 --> 13:10.917
through vibrations

13:12.249 --> 13:15.583
is to see why:

13:15.833 --> 13:18.042
why I want this?

13:18.374 --> 13:21.333
Why my attention goes to my comfort?

13:21.833 --> 13:24.207
Why my attention goes to food,

13:24.583 --> 13:27.708
why to my family, why to my children,

13:28.083 --> 13:31.333
when I have to achieve the highest?

13:31.833 --> 13:34.583
So you start introspecting yourself.

13:35.083 --> 13:38.167
Then you know on your vibrations also

13:38.458 --> 13:41.167
there's something wrong with you.

13:41.917 --> 13:44.833
Then you don't try to see others,

13:45.083 --> 13:48.207
what's wrong with others, you start seeing yourself;

13:48.499 --> 13:54.207
because it's your own ascent

13:54.917 --> 13:57.583
you have to achieve.

14:00.499 --> 14:03.249
But in the olden times,

14:04.249 --> 14:09.249
all these things were done individually.

14:10.499 --> 14:13.750
Like a one person who starts

14:14.249 --> 14:17.291
the path of nirvana,

14:21.167 --> 14:26.208
he used to go into ekant, means into lonely places,

14:26.791 --> 14:28.958
stay away from people, avoid them,

14:29.249 --> 14:30.708
have nothing to do,

14:31.042 --> 14:34.958
and achieve this ascent,

14:35.917 --> 14:39.249
Self-realization, only for himself.

14:41.458 --> 14:44.042
It was not for others.

14:44.583 --> 14:48.249
Then this gentleman became absolutely exclusive.

14:48.833 --> 14:50.249
He wouldn't talk to anyone,

14:50.499 --> 14:52.583
he wouldn't meet anybody

14:53.083 --> 14:54.416
and he would sit somewhere

14:54.791 --> 14:59.291
on top of a remote mountain.

15:01.125 --> 15:03.125
Anybody who tried to meet him

15:03.333 --> 15:06.625
he would throw stones or say all kinds of horrible things,

15:06.917 --> 15:09.625
and never meet that person.

15:13.458 --> 15:17.666
But Sahaja Yoga is not the same thing.

15:18.958 --> 15:22.291
Sahaja Yoga is the ascent of the whole.

15:25.625 --> 15:28.541
This kind of singular achievements

15:28.875 --> 15:31.541
did not lead people anywhere.

15:32.458 --> 15:36.416
Saints of course tried to talk to people,

15:36.791 --> 15:39.208
tell them about Self-realization, about God,

15:39.625 --> 15:43.416
about righteousness, about value system;

15:44.000 --> 15:48.958
but they too were regarded as something strange,

15:49.791 --> 15:53.125
and were tortured and troubled.

15:55.333 --> 16:01.083
So on the level of an individual ascent,

16:01.666 --> 16:03.791
they couldn't do anything for others

16:04.125 --> 16:06.875
except for talking about it, telling about it,

16:07.207 --> 16:11.541
till Sahaja Yoga came.

16:12.125 --> 16:15.875
Even the talking about it was prohibited.

16:17.291 --> 16:21.541
Till the twelfth century in India

16:21.958 --> 16:25.416
nobody talked about it to the public.

16:27.083 --> 16:28.875
It was all in Sanskrit,

16:29.207 --> 16:32.000
very difficult Sanskrit books

16:32.416 --> 16:35.291
which were only available to few aspirants.

16:35.666 --> 16:38.625
Was explained to very, very few even,

16:39.333 --> 16:43.750
amounting to few numbers of people.

16:46.083 --> 16:51.000
But giving realization was denied.

16:52.291 --> 16:56.083
So only one master had one disciple,

16:56.958 --> 16:59.666
and all was the individual ascent,

17:00.000 --> 17:01.791
individual working out.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.416
Such a disciple was taken away from others

17:04.750 --> 17:06.958
and was kept in secret,

17:07.333 --> 17:09.249
worked it out on him;

17:09.374 --> 17:14.000
and just he may sing, he may write poems,

17:14.291 --> 17:17.000
he may talk about it, he might say what his joy is,

17:17.374 --> 17:21.207
but he had no right to give realization to anyone,

17:21.541 --> 17:24.249
neither he knew how to give realization.

17:26.416 --> 17:29.541
So now you see how far you have gone.

17:30.083 --> 17:32.541
You've got your realization

17:33.083 --> 17:35.750
without giving up much.

17:37.541 --> 17:41.000
You can work on a much wider scale,

17:41.499 --> 17:43.875
you can give realizations to other.

17:44.207 --> 17:47.750
You know about all the subtle knowledge

17:48.083 --> 17:51.958
about Sahaja Yoga.

17:54.499 --> 17:56.625
But today I'm going to tell you something more

17:57.042 --> 17:59.333
which we have to know.

18:01.249 --> 18:03.750
It's very important to know,

18:04.207 --> 18:08.917
because as was described by people

18:10.207 --> 18:14.917
that they practice Sahaja Yoga as they go to church,

18:16.458 --> 18:20.042
but it's not from their heart.

18:22.958 --> 18:26.167
And heart is the abode of the spirit

18:28.499 --> 18:32.333
- is the Shiva within us.

18:34.083 --> 18:36.958
So we have to know more about heart,

18:37.583 --> 18:41.333
and that is very important.

18:42.791 --> 18:45.666
You know about these three nadis we have:

18:46.125 --> 18:47.917
Ida, Pingala, Sushumna;

18:48.875 --> 18:52.000
but in the heart there are four nadis.

18:55.833 --> 19:00.167
And the one nadi goes to Mooladhara,

19:03.374 --> 19:07.416
and if you cross the limits of Mooladhara it goes to hell.

19:07.750 --> 19:12.083
That's why they say that Shiva is a destroyer.

19:12.541 --> 19:16.249
Actually you ask for your destruction.

19:18.249 --> 19:23.207
And when you ask for your destruction, you have it.

19:27.875 --> 19:31.750
Even if it destroys everything, as I was telling,

19:32.374 --> 19:36.499
it's like when a fruit has to come,

19:36.917 --> 19:40.499
the petals look as if they're destroyed

19:40.833 --> 19:43.499
- as I have destroyed, I would say, many of your things:

19:43.917 --> 19:46.458
you can call it like your conditionings,

19:46.750 --> 19:49.042
your ego, your racialism, your fanaticism.

19:49.458 --> 19:52.499
All this has been destroyed in Sahaja Yoga.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.583
This has to be destroyed

19:56.083 --> 19:59.207
for the beauty to come out.

20:00.374 --> 20:06.499
So when your maryadas

20:06.958 --> 20:11.583
you cross beyond certain point,

20:12.458 --> 20:15.666
you go to your destruction.

20:18.708 --> 20:22.499
In four directions there are destructions built,

20:22.958 --> 20:25.833
as there are four nadis.

20:27.458 --> 20:30.125
So now, what is to be done?

20:31.167 --> 20:35.167
How are we to stop this destruction of the,

20:35.583 --> 20:38.917
through the first nadi, going to hell?

20:40.458 --> 20:44.917
One of the qualities of Shiva is that He's innocence.

20:45.833 --> 20:48.917
He's extremely innocent. He's innocent like a child.

20:49.249 --> 20:52.333
He is innocence personified.

20:55.374 --> 20:58.541
So

21:00.291 --> 21:06.875
we have to put our carnal desires,

21:07.958 --> 21:10.833
dissolve them,

21:12.541 --> 21:17.374
dissolve them into the innocence,

21:17.750 --> 21:21.000
the ocean of innocence.

21:23.708 --> 21:28.291
You have to dissolve it in the ocean of innocence.

21:30.541 --> 21:36.291
Innocence is something to be appreciated,

21:36.625 --> 21:40.833
to be understood, to be enjoyed.

21:41.249 --> 21:44.958
Like you see animals, they're innocent;

21:45.958 --> 21:50.708
you see children, they're innocent;

21:51.499 --> 21:53.708
flowers, they're innocent.

21:55.083 --> 21:59.000
Divert your attention

22:01.083 --> 22:03.833
to all these things.

22:08.208 --> 22:11.666
You see, on walking on the street,

22:12.249 --> 22:15.167
what is there to see best

22:15.499 --> 22:19.249
is all at three feet height.

22:20.708 --> 22:24.167
You see at three feet height all the flowers,

22:24.499 --> 22:26.499
all the beautiful grass,

22:26.917 --> 22:31.207
all the children who are about three feet are the best.

22:32.207 --> 22:35.833
You need not see people who are above that.

22:38.750 --> 22:42.458
Just see on three feet level.

22:45.958 --> 22:50.958
You can see the legs of somebody, that's all right.

22:52.625 --> 22:55.833
But you don't see the eyes of a person

22:56.207 --> 22:59.083
who are not innocent.

23:00.000 --> 23:03.541
So dissolve this desire

23:05.125 --> 23:07.708
into innocence.

23:09.125 --> 23:12.333
And this Mooladhara which is innocent

23:14.208 --> 23:17.917
is not dead, finished, but is innocent,

23:19.249 --> 23:21.374
it is righteous,

23:21.791 --> 23:24.458
it is Shri Ganesha's qualities,

23:26.666 --> 23:28.791
it's pure.

23:29.167 --> 23:31.333
So even if you are in this world,

23:31.583 --> 23:34.000
even if you are living like a human being,

23:34.374 --> 23:36.791
even if you have children,

23:37.583 --> 23:40.666
still you are innocent.

23:42.583 --> 23:47.791
Like once the wives of Shri Krishna

23:48.167 --> 23:51.125
- He had sixteen thousand wives to begin with,

23:51.458 --> 23:53.416
and the five more.

23:53.833 --> 23:55.541
The sixteen thousand were His powers,

23:55.875 --> 23:58.708
and five were the elements.

24:01.416 --> 24:07.167
They were wanting to go to pray to some big well-known,

24:09.207 --> 24:13.708
I should say, saint had come, a maharshi had come.

24:14.083 --> 24:17.625
So they wanted to go and see him and pay respects.

24:18.249 --> 24:21.625
So they asked Shri Krishna's permission,

24:22.000 --> 24:26.207
but when they went they found the river was all in spate,

24:26.958 --> 24:30.708
so flooded they could not cross over.

24:31.458 --> 24:33.042
They came back, they said,

24:33.333 --> 24:38.291
"How can we cross over this river? It's all in spate."

24:39.208 --> 24:40.541
So this Krishna said,

24:40.875 --> 24:42.666
"All right, you just go and say,

24:43.207 --> 24:47.416
РІР‚В˜If Shri Krishna is Yogeshwara,

24:48.167 --> 24:53.249
and if He is absolutely innocent about sex,

24:54.708 --> 24:57.000
you go down.'"

25:00.125 --> 25:01.833
They said, "How can we? We are so many wives.

25:02.167 --> 25:04.416
What is He talking about?"

25:05.875 --> 25:08.583
So they went down and said this to the river,

25:09.042 --> 25:11.708
and the river went down, and they were surprised that

25:12.125 --> 25:16.333
"this husband of ours is saying all these things."

25:20.291 --> 25:25.167
They went across and worshipped that rishi

25:26.207 --> 25:30.167
and they were coming back, again the river was in floods.

25:32.125 --> 25:33.875
So they went back to the rishi, said,

25:34.167 --> 25:36.583
"Now how are we to cross over because it's in floods?"

25:37.042 --> 25:38.167
He said, "How did you come?"

25:38.416 --> 25:41.333
So they told the story of Shri Krishna.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.875
Now they had fed this rishi with food and fruits

25:45.207 --> 25:48.000
and he had eaten such a lot.

25:48.416 --> 25:51.791
"All right, you go and tell this river that

25:52.125 --> 25:55.207
this rishi has not eaten at all anything."

25:55.625 --> 25:57.750
They said, "How can it be? Just now you ate before us."

25:58.167 --> 25:59.625
He said, "Just go and see."

25:59.958 --> 26:05.583
They went back and told this to the river.

26:07.499 --> 26:10.708
The river again went down.

26:13.416 --> 26:15.958
So to live in this world,

26:16.583 --> 26:18.958
to be a wife or to be a husband,

26:19.291 --> 26:24.416
to be married, whatever it is,

26:26.249 --> 26:29.042
you can be innocent,

26:29.625 --> 26:32.875
absolutely innocent about it.

26:33.416 --> 26:36.583
That's the sign of your purity.

26:39.875 --> 26:44.875
The second nadi, the second channel

26:45.291 --> 26:48.750
that can take you to destruction is desire.

26:49.833 --> 26:52.374
That's why Buddha has said that desirelessness

26:52.875 --> 26:56.499
is the only way that people do not get old,

26:56.875 --> 26:59.207
nor sick,

27:00.249 --> 27:03.083
nor worried.

27:06.833 --> 27:10.374
Now this desire that we have,

27:11.374 --> 27:13.167
"I want this,"

27:13.374 --> 27:16.708
in the West is much more than anywhere else

27:17.083 --> 27:19.207
because the entrepreneurs are every day

27:19.499 --> 27:21.750
producing new things.

27:22.167 --> 27:25.833
Say for example a hairdress,

27:26.207 --> 27:28.750
so the women want to buy this wig or that wig,

27:29.042 --> 27:32.249
"It's my desire, I must have this wig to put on my head."

27:32.708 --> 27:36.625
The another one says, "All right, I must have this one."

27:38.625 --> 27:44.708
And the desire, for men, is "Oh, if he is having

27:45.083 --> 27:48.583
a Rolls Royce, why shouldn't I have one?"

27:51.374 --> 27:54.833
They cannot enjoy somebody else's Rolls Royce.

27:56.750 --> 28:01.917
It should be your own, that "I should have the possession."

28:03.499 --> 28:07.833
Desires can be of any kind, not only material.

28:08.291 --> 28:13.416
The desires could be also

28:13.875 --> 28:16.083
quite mental,

28:18.125 --> 28:20.958
"I must possess this woman,

28:21.416 --> 28:24.291
I must possess this child."

28:24.958 --> 28:29.625
All kinds of possessions that work into you as desires.

28:30.875 --> 28:34.416
But I wouldn't say it is because of attachment.

28:36.416 --> 28:40.875
It's not attachment, but it is just to have more.

28:47.374 --> 28:54.083
Go on adding up things, getting things

28:57.750 --> 29:01.875
- still one doesn't feel happy and satisfied.

29:04.125 --> 29:06.416
What is the reason

29:07.750 --> 29:12.042
for this kind of a desire is that it's not pure desire.

29:12.917 --> 29:15.541
It's an impure desire.

29:16.208 --> 29:17.750
It's an impure desire,

29:18.000 --> 29:20.208
and when such a desire starts working

29:20.541 --> 29:22.541
you can go any far,

29:22.917 --> 29:25.333
like Saddam Hussein, like Hitler,

29:25.583 --> 29:27.167
like anything is nothing

29:27.458 --> 29:32.000
but absolutely desire beyond

29:34.042 --> 29:36.917
any limitations.

29:37.791 --> 29:40.416
You want to dominate others

29:42.167 --> 29:44.791
is also another desire.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.458
All these desires

29:50.583 --> 29:54.333
lead you ultimately to a destruction,

29:56.541 --> 29:58.750
because there's no joy,

29:59.208 --> 30:01.291
there's no happiness.

30:03.333 --> 30:09.458
For example, now I want to have a sari,

30:12.917 --> 30:15.583
so I want to buy a sari.

30:16.917 --> 30:19.458
All my attention will be how will I get that sari,

30:19.791 --> 30:21.917
I must get that sari, this thing, that thing.

30:22.208 --> 30:27.000
The attention becomes polluted,

30:27.458 --> 30:31.583
disturbed, for a nonsensical thing like a sari.

30:32.000 --> 30:36.000
The attention which has to enjoy,

30:37.333 --> 30:40.666
which has to enjoy the spirit,

30:42.291 --> 30:44.875
which has to nourish the spirit,

30:45.208 --> 30:51.167
becomes disturbed because of desires.

30:53.042 --> 30:56.208
In the first place the attention

30:56.541 --> 31:00.416
is disturbed because we are not innocent.

31:01.666 --> 31:05.541
In the second place the attention

31:06.458 --> 31:10.750
gets into turmoil because we have desire.

31:15.583 --> 31:20.791
So what should we do as far as the desire is concerned?

31:24.750 --> 31:27.541
The desire for beautiful things

31:29.666 --> 31:33.583
- we can shift our desire,

31:34.416 --> 31:37.208
material desire into aesthetics,

31:37.666 --> 31:42.167
and have one thing but which is really aesthetically rich;

31:44.000 --> 31:46.875
because that's the quality of Shiva,

31:47.167 --> 31:50.875
that He gives aesthetics to everything.

31:51.208 --> 31:53.458
Now supposing this looks very plain,

31:53.750 --> 31:57.125
simple and one may say that mechanical.

31:57.666 --> 31:59.875
But if it was Shiva's job

32:00.167 --> 32:03.458
He would have done something beautiful about it.

32:05.167 --> 32:09.875
So the quality of Shiva is that He beautifies everything

32:10.541 --> 32:14.125
that is created by Brahmadeva,

32:14.958 --> 32:18.125
evolved by Vishnu.

32:18.708 --> 32:21.750
He's the one who does

32:22.083 --> 32:25.125
the subtle work of creating aesthetics.

32:25.583 --> 32:27.625
You've seen My photographs many a times

32:27.958 --> 32:32.167
with so many lights, this, that - is all His job.

32:32.499 --> 32:33.875
He's doing it.

32:34.207 --> 32:36.875
He throws lights in such a manner,

32:37.458 --> 32:39.750
He works out in such a manner.

32:40.167 --> 32:42.917
Just He wants to convince you about Me.

32:43.458 --> 32:44.750
It's His job.

32:45.042 --> 32:48.750
So His job is to create aesthetics:

32:50.625 --> 32:53.249
aesthetics of behavior,

32:54.125 --> 32:58.125
aesthetics of poetry.

33:00.958 --> 33:05.374
Everything that is created is made beautiful,

33:06.207 --> 33:10.625
is joy-giving, by Shiva - that's His quality.

33:13.541 --> 33:15.374
So whatever you desire,

33:15.666 --> 33:19.083
if you start working it out,

33:21.416 --> 33:27.416
desiring for something aesthetically handmade, nice thing,

33:31.833 --> 33:34.000
gradually you'll find

33:34.374 --> 33:36.750
you'll end up with vibrations,

33:37.249 --> 33:40.708
because all beautiful things have vibrations.

33:43.000 --> 33:44.541
And to have the vibrations

33:44.875 --> 33:48.000
you'll have to go to pure desire.

33:49.625 --> 33:52.416
So this desire which is madness,

33:52.833 --> 33:55.083
which makes you mad,

33:55.499 --> 34:01.083
which is so much dull and boring

34:02.499 --> 34:06.958
becomes pure desire, because you have to dissolve

34:07.333 --> 34:09.499
all your desires into vibration.

34:09.750 --> 34:13.708
You start desiring nothing but vibrations after some time.

34:15.917 --> 34:18.917
You'll not buy anything which has no vibrations.

34:19.374 --> 34:22.499
You'll not talk to a person who has no vibrations.

34:23.249 --> 34:26.833
If somebody has [no] vibrations you'll just run away.

34:33.083 --> 34:36.125
I've seen people running away

34:36.458 --> 34:38.208
from some people

34:38.499 --> 34:42.666
as if some monkey is after them.

34:42.958 --> 34:44.083
When I look around,

34:44.374 --> 34:45.958
I find there are people who are drunkard,

34:46.208 --> 34:48.458
or somebody coming or something.

34:48.917 --> 34:52.083
They might have been drunkard themselves once upon a time,

34:52.583 --> 34:53.791
but now they run away,

34:54.125 --> 34:58.167
"No, no, no, no. Not so now. Now no, no more."

35:00.249 --> 35:02.666
We had three, four hippies to begin

35:03.042 --> 35:05.125
with who came with Me to India.

35:05.374 --> 35:07.249
They're normal like you, they were become,

35:07.583 --> 35:09.207
you see, Sahaja yogis.

35:09.499 --> 35:13.416
And four, five hippies came to My program,

35:13.750 --> 35:15.708
it was in Rahuri, I think.

35:16.083 --> 35:20.374
They got a fright of their life, "Oh no, oh, God!"

35:20.625 --> 35:22.083
I said, "What's the matter with you?

35:22.291 --> 35:24.000
Why are you so frightened?"

35:24.291 --> 35:26.249
So I turned round to see these hippies,

35:26.541 --> 35:29.499
and by the time I'd turned round they were out.

35:30.625 --> 35:33.125
They were no more there.

35:34.958 --> 35:39.833
So then what happens, all desire ends up into chaitanya,

35:40.416 --> 35:42.541
into vibrations.

35:42.833 --> 35:43.917
And if it does not,

35:44.208 --> 35:46.374
then you must know there's something still missing.

35:46.708 --> 35:49.666
But if you do not do this,

35:50.833 --> 35:54.167
then you end up into your destruction.

35:55.374 --> 35:59.000
So to say that He's a destroyer

35:59.333 --> 36:03.708
is a very one-sided statement.

36:05.917 --> 36:08.208
He has both the powers.

36:08.666 --> 36:12.416
He has the power to give you vibrations.

36:13.167 --> 36:16.000
He gives you vibrations.

36:20.208 --> 36:24.333
The Goddess is the power, Shakti,

36:25.208 --> 36:27.125
but He makes the vibrations.

36:27.333 --> 36:30.249
It's like these are the fingers, all right,

36:31.167 --> 36:35.249
but if they tickle you then it's Shiva.

36:38.666 --> 36:41.125
The fingers are that of the Goddess, all right,

36:41.374 --> 36:45.208
but if it tickles, you know, gives you joy,

36:45.583 --> 36:50.167
happiness, it's Shiva, is the bhakti.

36:51.458 --> 36:55.208
The joy of bhakti comes from Shiva.

36:57.333 --> 37:00.000
Today only I was explaining

37:00.333 --> 37:03.458
how one lady who was a Devi bhakt

37:04.000 --> 37:06.625
and has done so much study of bhakti

37:06.958 --> 37:08.958
and all that and knew so much,

37:09.208 --> 37:13.416
just merged into Me.

37:13.458 --> 37:16.333
I just couldn't understand her how, what she has done,

37:16.833 --> 37:18.458
because normally people don't do.

37:18.708 --> 37:20.583
When they are reading about Devi they think,

37:20.833 --> 37:22.374
"All right, this is Devi, this is Mataji."

37:22.625 --> 37:24.499
You see, it's separate things.

37:24.750 --> 37:27.958
They don't know they are reading about Devi.

37:29.499 --> 37:31.833
So she said, "Mother, I just identified.

37:32.167 --> 37:35.083
It's written that how You are gentle,

37:35.458 --> 37:38.083
the Goddess is gentle, how She touches me,

37:38.458 --> 37:40.167
how She looks after me,

37:40.458 --> 37:42.833
how Her attention is on me."

37:43.249 --> 37:46.958
Like there's a sentence "kataksha, kataksha, nirikshana:

37:47.207 --> 37:49.583
every glance is an inspection."

37:49.958 --> 37:51.833
But "inspection" not a very good word,

37:52.167 --> 37:55.708
but "nirikshana" means inspection, divine inspection.

37:58.333 --> 38:00.708
"So all the time I feel that it's You, You,

38:01.042 --> 38:04.458
You are all the time - when I listen to music

38:04.791 --> 38:07.875
I feel now, see, She is looking at me,

38:08.291 --> 38:11.791
She is feeling me, She is nourishing me.

38:12.333 --> 38:15.583
All the time I feel Your love."

38:17.666 --> 38:19.917
That's how the bhakti comes in.

38:20.333 --> 38:21.666
So if you have vibrations

38:22.042 --> 38:26.249
that doesn't mean that they are something dry, you see?

38:27.499 --> 38:29.583
No,

38:29.917 --> 38:33.917
it means the joy of bhakti.

38:36.583 --> 38:40.167
Bhakti is, you can call it adoration, this, that.

38:40.458 --> 38:45.499
It's the ocean of love that is God.

38:46.499 --> 38:48.207
You just get drenched into it.

38:48.499 --> 38:50.958
There's no words to it.

38:55.207 --> 38:57.167
And that is what when you feel,

38:57.374 --> 38:59.750
you must know that

39:00.458 --> 39:04.458
you have taken the spirit

39:05.917 --> 39:10.042
as a real connection

39:11.458 --> 39:14.708
between you and your Mother,

39:15.833 --> 39:18.374
or your Father.

39:20.333 --> 39:25.833
There's no differentiation.

39:28.249 --> 39:31.583
You are one

39:31.833 --> 39:34.583
in that ocean, drenched in the ocean.

39:34.958 --> 39:37.625
You are the drop, you are the ocean.

39:38.167 --> 39:41.207
You are one in that bhakti.

39:42.207 --> 39:46.207
And that bhakti cannot be mechanical,

39:49.499 --> 39:52.249
because not man-made.

39:55.583 --> 40:00.207
So to enjoy Sahaja Yoga

40:01.499 --> 40:05.499
you must know that it's not dry vibrations only,

40:06.167 --> 40:08.833
but is the bhakti.

40:09.666 --> 40:12.125
That is the joy

40:12.750 --> 40:14.750
of Shiva's quality,

40:15.125 --> 40:18.541
the quality of joy that He adds

40:19.208 --> 40:22.083
to our life.

40:22.750 --> 40:26.958
Everything seems to be surrounded, resounding.

40:27.208 --> 40:29.291
Same thing the joy,

40:29.625 --> 40:32.291
that "I'm loved so much by God,

40:32.708 --> 40:34.750
that God loves me,

40:35.083 --> 40:38.000
that I have a meaning in life."

40:39.499 --> 40:44.499
Then the ego drops out first of all,

40:46.083 --> 40:51.541
and also the conditionings drop out.

40:55.499 --> 40:58.499
Now the third nadi:

41:04.208 --> 41:07.208
third nadi

41:07.750 --> 41:11.666
is the nadi by which we feel attached,

41:13.666 --> 41:15.666
attached to someone.

41:16.000 --> 41:20.333
Like this is my child, this is my husband,

41:20.917 --> 41:23.042
this is my family,

41:23.333 --> 41:25.583
this is my wife,

41:26.291 --> 41:29.750
this is my father, this is my mother.

41:32.167 --> 41:35.791
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga of everyone,

41:36.167 --> 41:39.291
when they are just the beginners,

41:39.875 --> 41:44.208
so they talk about their whole family,

41:45.458 --> 41:46.917
"My father is like this,

41:47.208 --> 41:50.167
my mother is sick, my mother's sister's brother's

41:50.458 --> 41:55.416
this, that's real, this thing, is not well."

41:56.208 --> 42:00.791
As if, you see, we all have taken a contract.

42:02.791 --> 42:05.666
What should I do?

42:07.374 --> 42:11.625
Like today somebody said that "You see,

42:12.958 --> 42:14.958
they lost their first child.

42:15.333 --> 42:17.416
First child they lost,

42:18.249 --> 42:21.125
because the child was sleeping in another room."

42:21.333 --> 42:25.167
I said, "Small children should sleep with mother,

42:25.416 --> 42:27.333
and mother must look after the children."

42:27.499 --> 42:28.875
It's simple thing - I mean,

42:29.207 --> 42:31.708
in India no mother would accept such a situation.

42:31.875 --> 42:33.541
She'll throw away the husband,

42:33.875 --> 42:37.083
say, "What's this? I have to look after the child."

42:37.416 --> 42:42.125
So I said, "Tell them that they should sleep with the child."

42:43.541 --> 42:44.875
But they don't believe in it.

42:45.125 --> 42:47.291
So all right - what can we do?

42:47.541 --> 42:50.416
Have we taken their contract that

42:50.750 --> 42:52.666
we should look after their children,

42:53.083 --> 42:56.291
even when they don't want to listen to us?

42:57.125 --> 43:03.207
So the idea is, all the time in the beginning is that

43:03.499 --> 43:07.499
"Oh Mother, I've been doing Sahaja Yoga for one month,

43:07.833 --> 43:12.625
but so far my financial condition has not improved."

43:13.625 --> 43:16.541
As if they're going to sue Me for that,

43:18.207 --> 43:21.416
as if I've let them down.

43:24.416 --> 43:26.083
But they don't want to see that

43:26.291 --> 43:28.499
you have just now come to Sahaja Yoga,

43:28.833 --> 43:31.125
or even if you have been in Sahaja Yoga for so many years,

43:31.374 --> 43:34.207
you have not been a Sahaja yogi.

43:34.625 --> 43:37.083
Something missing, you don't deserve.

43:37.374 --> 43:40.374
Something wrong with you, not with Sahaja Yoga.

43:40.833 --> 43:44.374
But they feel that Sahaja Yoga

43:44.833 --> 43:48.958
is something which has got the contract.

43:49.458 --> 43:50.708
Immediately they'll inform you,

43:51.000 --> 43:52.042
"Now somebody is sick there,

43:52.249 --> 43:54.125
somebody's somebody's somebody's somebody.

43:54.416 --> 43:59.333
Send five Sahaja yogis." For what?

44:02.458 --> 44:06.458
These attachments start working within us.

44:07.291 --> 44:09.958
Now some people I've seen

44:10.833 --> 44:14.291
are very attached to their children

44:15.083 --> 44:21.249
and they go on pampering, "Oh, my child, my child."

44:21.875 --> 44:23.249
And suddenly they discover

44:23.499 --> 44:27.042
the child is now is a devil's child.

44:28.458 --> 44:30.249
The child starts answering back,

44:30.583 --> 44:33.249
saying all kinds of things, beating the parents,

44:33.583 --> 44:36.666
misbehaving, and then they suddenly discover

44:37.125 --> 44:40.208
that "this is the child whom I have been looking after,

44:40.458 --> 44:41.541
giving so much love."

44:41.833 --> 44:43.458
And they feel even worse,

44:43.791 --> 44:47.208
because "I have done so much for my wife,

44:47.541 --> 44:48.708
and she is treating me like this."

44:49.042 --> 44:51.249
"I've done so much for my husband,

44:51.583 --> 44:52.791
and he is treating me like this."

44:53.125 --> 44:54.666
Why do you do so much?

44:54.917 --> 44:56.374
There's no need.

44:56.708 --> 45:00.791
And if you are doing it, you just do it and you forget it.

45:01.917 --> 45:03.208
I never feel that way.

45:03.583 --> 45:06.167
I know of Sahaja yogis for whom I have worked very hard,

45:06.458 --> 45:08.125
and they have gone down.

45:08.458 --> 45:09.666
Only thing if I feel anything,

45:09.958 --> 45:11.708
only God knows where will they jump?

45:11.917 --> 45:13.541
Where will they be in hell?

45:13.791 --> 45:16.541
What will happen to them? That's the only concern.

45:16.917 --> 45:18.541
Not the concern what has happened,

45:18.791 --> 45:21.207
because nothing can \happen to Me.

45:24.000 --> 45:26.042
But if they have been sinful

45:26.458 --> 45:30.917
I just get worried about their future,

45:31.291 --> 45:34.333
about their lives. That's different.

45:34.791 --> 45:37.333
So this kind of attachment that is we call in Sanskrit is

45:37.666 --> 45:40.208
"mamatva" - "this is mine, that's my child,

45:40.541 --> 45:43.666
my this thing, my that."

45:46.333 --> 45:50.208
Who are your relations are Sahaja yogis - remember this.

45:50.541 --> 45:52.291
It's a sentence you must remember,

45:52.625 --> 45:55.666
"My relations are Sahaja yogis only.

45:56.042 --> 46:00.416
And anybody who plays against Sahaja yogis,

46:00.750 --> 46:03.625
troubles Sahaja yogis - that person could be my own wife,

46:03.917 --> 46:07.458
could be my own child - is not mine."

46:08.875 --> 46:12.333
Because I'll not allow such a thing to happen.

46:13.042 --> 46:16.208
This relationship is all right till

46:16.666 --> 46:20.666
Sahaja yogis are one with each other.

46:21.000 --> 46:25.666
As soon as somebody tries to harm any other Sahaja yogi,

46:26.125 --> 46:28.207
then I'm not with that person.

46:28.416 --> 46:29.917
I've seen there are many like that,

46:30.208 --> 46:31.750
but very good Sahaja yogis.

46:32.083 --> 46:33.458
They'll never side with their wives,

46:33.750 --> 46:35.791
never side with their children,

46:36.208 --> 46:39.416
because they know if you are siding with them

46:39.750 --> 46:44.791
you are making them sinful, you're destroying them.

46:45.291 --> 46:46.875
They're worried about their ascent

46:47.207 --> 46:50.208
so they'll never allow, never allow anybody,

46:50.625 --> 46:54.207
a relation of theirs to trouble others.

46:55.875 --> 46:58.083
I have seen some children

46:58.666 --> 47:01.083
who are extremely naughty,

47:01.333 --> 47:04.208
they're very troublesome, very violent,

47:05.000 --> 47:07.208
and the parents just saying, "Mother, put them right.

47:07.541 --> 47:10.541
We leave it to You." They are to be put right.

47:10.875 --> 47:11.917
But others will say,

47:12.207 --> 47:14.666
"Oh, no, no, no, no; you see my child,

47:15.083 --> 47:18.416
he cannot do such a thing, you know."

47:21.000 --> 47:26.083
So one has to understand the discrimination part of it,

47:26.458 --> 47:30.083
that "Why am I attached?"

47:31.416 --> 47:33.207
I've given this simile many a times,

47:33.458 --> 47:35.291
like the sap of the tree rises,

47:35.625 --> 47:39.083
goes to various places of the trees, various areas,

47:39.291 --> 47:42.625
looks after the bark, looks after the branch,

47:42.917 --> 47:44.791
looks after the leaves,

47:45.042 --> 47:46.833
flowers and fruits, and comes back,

47:47.208 --> 47:50.249
or it gets evaporated. It doesn't get attached.

47:51.000 --> 47:53.249
If it gets involved into one of them

47:53.583 --> 47:54.833
the whole tree will die,

47:55.167 --> 47:58.167
and that part which

47:58.541 --> 48:03.374
is so close to the sap will also die.

48:03.666 --> 48:07.000
But sap has much more sense than we have.

48:11.875 --> 48:13.625
To them, husband's so important

48:13.875 --> 48:17.083
- I mean so many problems of husbands, wives, this, that.

48:17.374 --> 48:20.499
"My God," I sometimes think, "What is this?"

48:20.791 --> 48:23.499
That's why they used to say, "Take a sanyas"

48:23.791 --> 48:25.416
- so nobody can talk about wife,

48:25.750 --> 48:27.000
children, nothing.

48:27.208 --> 48:31.208
You have to be a sanyasi, first of all be a sanyasi.

48:31.625 --> 48:32.917
So no headache to the guru.

48:33.291 --> 48:34.666
As soon as you start talking

48:35.000 --> 48:37.625
about any one relation of yours, the guru would say,

48:37.917 --> 48:41.625
"All right, you get out. Nothing doing. No good."

48:44.042 --> 48:47.167
But in Sahaja Yoga -

48:47.458 --> 48:51.458
Sahaja Yoga has much deeper

48:52.208 --> 48:53.666
work to do.

48:53.917 --> 48:55.833
It has to penetrate into the society,

48:56.125 --> 48:58.125
into the political life, into economic life.

48:58.249 --> 49:00.207
You have to emancipate the whole world.

49:00.499 --> 49:02.750
Try to understand your responsibility.

49:04.208 --> 49:09.167
You are not only here for one ascetic ascent, no.

49:12.666 --> 49:14.666
How much wisdom you must have,

49:15.125 --> 49:16.917
how much love you must have,

49:17.458 --> 49:20.416
and how much discrimination you must have,

49:20.708 --> 49:22.374
to understand that you are chosen

49:22.708 --> 49:25.708
for the emancipation of the whole world.

49:29.583 --> 49:33.333
So now this so-called limited love,

49:33.833 --> 49:37.000
what is the solution which takes you to destruction

49:37.333 --> 49:40.458
is the unlimited love.

49:41.708 --> 49:46.917
Because Shiva is nothing but love, He's love.

49:50.374 --> 49:55.791
Love is that corrects, that nourishes,

49:57.458 --> 50:00.708
that wants your benevolence.

50:02.208 --> 50:03.917
That's what Shiva is.

50:04.208 --> 50:07.249
It wants your benevolence.

50:09.042 --> 50:12.333
It looks after your benevolence.

50:13.000 --> 50:17.042
So when

50:18.125 --> 50:23.167
you are looking after the benevolence of others with love,

50:26.042 --> 50:29.541
then the whole life changes,

50:31.791 --> 50:34.708
the whole pattern changes,

50:35.458 --> 50:37.666
and you really enjoy it because

50:38.042 --> 50:40.208
you become one with so many,

50:40.583 --> 50:43.374
concerned with so many families, so many things,

50:43.791 --> 50:48.083
so many problems of others,

50:48.541 --> 50:51.207
and you just feel you are one with so many.

50:51.541 --> 50:55.000
Now see, we are so many Sahaja yogis here today.

50:55.458 --> 50:58.083
First time when I came to Italy,

50:58.291 --> 51:00.917
I must tell you,

51:01.541 --> 51:04.541
I came with Christine - no,

51:04.875 --> 51:08.416
what's the name of Gregoire's wife? Catherine.

51:08.958 --> 51:11.875
And she was the only one who knew Italian.

51:12.249 --> 51:14.083
And we had told some newspaper

51:14.416 --> 51:17.625
to reserve some sort of a hall and advertise for us.

51:17.958 --> 51:19.416
Nothing was done.

51:19.750 --> 51:22.625
So when we came we couldn't find anyone.

51:23.000 --> 51:26.207
So I went round with her to put the posters,

51:26.541 --> 51:29.249
but still nobody came.

51:29.833 --> 51:32.125
And today we are so many.

51:32.499 --> 51:36.833
But we must know that we are bound to each other by love,

51:40.083 --> 51:45.541
and the love that is for our benevolence, for our ascent.

51:47.625 --> 51:51.833
And then you just start enjoying everyone.

51:53.000 --> 51:55.291
And then you don't think what race you are,

51:55.541 --> 51:57.541
what country you are, what this thing you are,

51:57.791 --> 51:59.875
nothing - a Sahaja yogi, finished!

52:00.207 --> 52:03.791
So you become a universal being.

52:05.000 --> 52:07.750
And this attitude has to be achieved.

52:08.207 --> 52:10.333
When I hear that some Indian girls

52:10.750 --> 52:14.666
are tortured and troubled, I think, "How can they do it?"

52:15.125 --> 52:19.208
Or somebody who has a black skin, they are tortured;

52:19.708 --> 52:22.374
or some Indians are treating somebody

52:22.791 --> 52:24.917
because they are of low caste.

52:25.249 --> 52:27.042
It's not possible,

52:27.333 --> 52:30.249
because they are all part and parcel of one body.

52:30.583 --> 52:35.499
They're all brothers and sisters, born of the same Mother.

52:36.208 --> 52:38.374
But this is only possible

52:38.791 --> 52:42.666
when you dissolve that limited relationship of yours

52:43.042 --> 52:45.833
into this great unlimited ocean of love;

52:46.208 --> 52:48.208
then only it is possible.

52:48.666 --> 52:51.458
And if it is not there, do not try to justify

52:51.833 --> 52:54.208
- just watch yourself.

52:55.000 --> 53:00.249
See for yourself: are you really in love with everyone?

53:01.791 --> 53:05.666
You see, I would say that

53:06.791 --> 53:09.541
all the time when I - sometimes I go for shopping,

53:09.791 --> 53:13.167
I just think, "Oh, this one would be nice for this one,

53:13.458 --> 53:15.917
that will be nice for that one."

53:16.208 --> 53:18.125
For Myself if you say,

53:18.458 --> 53:20.833
it's impossible for Me to buy anything for Myself,

53:21.125 --> 53:24.541
impossible situation.

53:26.208 --> 53:28.833
Unless and until it is absolutely immediate,

53:29.458 --> 53:33.125
or some problem is there if I am just without it.

53:33.416 --> 53:36.167
I won't even buy a drink for Myself,

53:36.416 --> 53:37.875
even if I am thirsty.

53:38.249 --> 53:41.207
Because the whole thing is the joy of others.

53:41.583 --> 53:44.167
"Oh, this will be nice for that person.

53:44.291 --> 53:47.042
This will be good for that person."

53:51.207 --> 53:55.958
All this is the most enjoyable thing.

53:56.207 --> 53:59.291
I mean, why all this is for there?

53:59.750 --> 54:01.499
After all, think about yourself,

54:01.875 --> 54:04.750
"Why am I here?

54:07.167 --> 54:10.708
I'm here to enjoy everyone - everyone.

54:11.249 --> 54:14.083
They are all realized souls,

54:14.750 --> 54:17.958
such beautiful lotuses.

54:18.708 --> 54:22.583
I'm not going to stoop down to the mud.

54:22.958 --> 54:25.958
Now I am a lotus."

54:28.833 --> 54:34.291
That is the way you open the heart,

54:36.499 --> 54:39.167
the lotus of your heart.

54:39.499 --> 54:44.207
And the fragrance of such a person is so beautiful,

54:45.416 --> 54:49.750
is so beautiful.

54:51.750 --> 54:54.291
So you are no more divisive,

54:54.708 --> 54:57.042
you do not want to separate from each other.

54:57.291 --> 55:01.625
Anywhere is done, you are agreeable to that;

55:01.958 --> 55:03.750
you don't think that it should be done here

55:04.083 --> 55:06.167
or there or there, but anywhere

55:06.374 --> 55:10.958
- but should be all of us together.

55:12.583 --> 55:17.167
So the small attachments that are with you

55:17.958 --> 55:21.416
have to be dissolved into this ocean of love,

55:21.750 --> 55:25.249
which is Shiva.

55:31.000 --> 55:34.291
Fourth one is the most important

55:34.833 --> 55:37.083
for all of us is to know

55:37.416 --> 55:41.291
that there's a nadi which passes through left Vishuddhi

55:42.666 --> 55:44.499
into the heart.

55:44.750 --> 55:48.083
Starts from the heart, goes up,

55:48.875 --> 55:50.958
passes through Agnya.

55:51.291 --> 55:55.000
It has four petals, and opens up.

56:00.000 --> 56:03.083
This is the one which gives

56:03.708 --> 56:07.499
you the state which is called as turya.

56:07.875 --> 56:11.958
We live in three states.

56:12.249 --> 56:15.750
In the living - in the awakened state,

56:16.083 --> 56:20.167
jagruti, our attention goes to this, that, and all that;

56:20.374 --> 56:22.958
we spoil our attention.

56:25.499 --> 56:29.833
But the second one is the one what we call

56:30.167 --> 56:31.875
is that we sleep.

56:32.083 --> 56:35.833
When we sleep also

56:36.791 --> 56:38.333
all these things that have happened

56:38.625 --> 56:41.499
come to us from our past and things like that.

56:43.625 --> 56:47.499
But then we go to the deeper sleep called as sushupti.

56:49.167 --> 56:52.708
Is a state where

56:53.625 --> 56:55.958
you have deep sleep,

56:56.249 --> 57:00.042
and you dream of something that is reality also.

57:01.042 --> 57:04.167
You may dream about Me.

57:05.042 --> 57:09.249
Like it's the ethereal part of the subconscious,

57:09.708 --> 57:13.917
where some beautiful

57:14.249 --> 57:15.958
informations are passed on.

57:16.208 --> 57:18.458
Supposing I've come, say, to Italy.

57:18.708 --> 57:20.583
Italians might know in their sushupti

57:20.917 --> 57:23.374
that I have come here, or maybe anybody might know

57:23.708 --> 57:25.374
- depends on.

57:25.708 --> 57:27.583
But the fourth state is called as turya.

57:27.833 --> 57:29.167
There are two more states.

57:29.458 --> 57:31.333
You are in the turya state, it's the fourth,

57:31.666 --> 57:33.374
"turya" means fourth.

57:33.791 --> 57:37.458
Fourth state is where that you are

57:37.833 --> 57:40.917
in a thoughtless awareness state.

57:42.541 --> 57:47.374
When there is no thought - just think of it

57:48.374 --> 57:52.458
- when there is no thought, you have to be innocent.

57:53.333 --> 57:57.833
When there is no thought, you have to have vibrations.

57:58.791 --> 58:02.708
When there is no thought, you cannot be attached to anyone.

58:03.708 --> 58:06.125
So into that thoughtless state you have come now,

58:06.374 --> 58:08.042
is the "turya sthiti."

58:08.333 --> 58:12.042
And in this state when you are,

58:13.833 --> 58:18.125
these four petals which are within you

58:18.666 --> 58:22.458
have to open out in your brain.

58:24.167 --> 58:27.666
They come from your heart to your brain.

58:30.917 --> 58:35.833
And that is when

58:38.333 --> 58:44.042
you absolutely understand what is God,

58:49.125 --> 58:53.958
absolutely you know what is God is.

58:56.042 --> 59:00.416
That is the time when

59:03.249 --> 59:07.499
one receives the real knowledge.

59:14.042 --> 59:17.083
But unless and until these four petals open,

59:17.374 --> 59:19.207
one may fall back,

59:19.625 --> 59:22.291
and that's why some of the Sahaja yogis

59:22.750 --> 59:27.291
who are still meddling with things

59:27.833 --> 59:31.042
that they should not do, go down.

59:31.708 --> 59:36.416
And they don't understand what is God is.

59:38.207 --> 59:40.249
But it's not the understanding

59:40.583 --> 59:42.416
- in a way you understand this one little point,

59:42.833 --> 59:46.625
that it comes from your heart into your brain,

59:47.167 --> 59:50.583
not from brain to your heart.

59:52.958 --> 59:55.875
It comes

59:56.249 --> 59:59.499
as if the ambrosia of

59:59.791 --> 01:00:04.042
your bhakti covers your brain, absolutely.

01:00:06.666 --> 01:00:07.791
Say for example,

01:00:08.042 --> 01:00:11.125
Shankaracharya wrote a beautiful treatise

01:00:11.416 --> 01:00:12.750
called as "Viveka Chudamani"

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:15.666
where he described what is God, this, that;

01:00:15.917 --> 01:00:18.416
and "viveka" means the conscience,

01:00:18.791 --> 01:00:22.541
and consciousness and all that he described quite a lot.

01:00:23.917 --> 01:00:26.125
But there was one horrible fellow called Sarma

01:00:26.374 --> 01:00:29.583
who started arguing with him and he got fed up,

01:00:29.917 --> 01:00:31.333
Shankaracharya.

01:00:31.625 --> 01:00:33.917
He said, "No use talking to them."

01:00:34.167 --> 01:00:37.042
So he just wrote "Saundarya Lahari."

01:00:37.374 --> 01:00:40.207
"Saundarya Lahari" is nothing but all the mantras

01:00:40.416 --> 01:00:41.249
praising the Mother.

01:00:41.583 --> 01:00:43.875
He said, "Why, I know Mother, now let me praise Her.

01:00:44.167 --> 01:00:47.750
Nothing doing - what's the use of talking to these people?

01:00:48.207 --> 01:00:50.291
Stupid things, how will they understand?"

01:00:50.708 --> 01:00:55.207
He realized that "These people haven't got that capacity,

01:00:55.499 --> 01:01:00.083
that sensitivity to understand what I know."

01:01:00.499 --> 01:01:05.833
That's the real knowledge, is to know what is God.

01:01:06.249 --> 01:01:08.708
And if that is God,

01:01:09.042 --> 01:01:12.249
then how can you suspect anything,

01:01:12.583 --> 01:01:15.583
how can you

01:01:16.541 --> 01:01:18.541
try to analyze anything?

01:01:18.833 --> 01:01:22.541
It's God. It's God Almighty,

01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:25.249
which knows everything,

01:01:25.666 --> 01:01:27.666
which does everything,

01:01:28.125 --> 01:01:30.833
which enjoys everything.

01:01:31.416 --> 01:01:35.208
That is the one you should say is the gyana,

01:01:35.541 --> 01:01:37.249
is the knowledge, is the true knowledge,

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:38.666
the pure knowledge.

01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:41.208
It's not the knowledge of chakras,

01:01:41.583 --> 01:01:43.583
not the knowledge of vibrations,

01:01:44.042 --> 01:01:45.833
not the knowledge of kundalini,

01:01:46.167 --> 01:01:50.583
but the knowledge of God Almighty.

01:01:51.083 --> 01:01:54.666
And the knowledge of God Almighty is not mental.

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:56.207
Again I tell you,

01:01:56.416 --> 01:02:00.958
it starts from your heart and goes to your brain,

01:02:01.750 --> 01:02:08.416
something that comes out of your experience of joy

01:02:08.833 --> 01:02:10.125
and covers your brain.

01:02:10.374 --> 01:02:13.000
So your brain cannot deny it any more.

01:02:13.291 --> 01:02:16.208
Like the - sometimes when you have your mother,

01:02:16.541 --> 01:02:19.666
little mother, you know the love of your mother.

01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.207
But you cannot explain, it comes from your heart

01:02:23.541 --> 01:02:24.958
and you say, "No, that's my mother,

01:02:25.207 --> 01:02:28.083
she won't do like that. I know my mother very well."

01:02:28.499 --> 01:02:30.207
The knowledge about your mother,

01:02:30.541 --> 01:02:32.958
the one who has given you birth;

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:36.833
may not be, mother may not be very good or whatever it is.

01:02:37.207 --> 01:02:39.541
But knowledge about God,

01:02:39.958 --> 01:02:42.125
that He's love, that He's truth,

01:02:42.499 --> 01:02:44.249
that He knows everything,

01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:49.750
that just become part and parcel of your being, absolutely,

01:02:50.083 --> 01:02:54.708
and that's the time we say is the nirvana.

01:02:56.708 --> 01:02:58.499
So it's important,

01:02:58.833 --> 01:03:01.750
specially for the people of the West,

01:03:02.083 --> 01:03:04.207
now open your hearts,

01:03:04.499 --> 01:03:08.625
because it starts from the heart, not from your brain.

01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:15.499
Do not judge people on vibrations.

01:03:15.833 --> 01:03:19.374
Judge yourself, all the time.

01:03:19.833 --> 01:03:24.833
I had told that Shiva Puja means more explanation,

01:03:25.083 --> 01:03:27.125
more understanding, more this thing;

01:03:27.416 --> 01:03:33.291
because in other pujas we do all these mantras, this, that,

01:03:34.958 --> 01:03:40.208
but in this puja is to know the knowledge,

01:03:40.666 --> 01:03:43.499
it's God.

01:03:43.958 --> 01:03:47.958
And to know that you know God itself is so great.

01:03:50.458 --> 01:03:53.791
Whatever it is - She may be Mahamaya,

01:03:54.042 --> 01:03:57.458
She may be anything, but I know Her.

01:03:57.958 --> 01:03:59.583
It cannot be described in one book,

01:03:59.833 --> 01:04:02.499
it cannot be described in hundred books.

01:04:02.958 --> 01:04:05.917
It cannot be described in words,

01:04:06.249 --> 01:04:10.833
but to know that's God - after all, that's God,

01:04:11.333 --> 01:04:14.125
God Almighty.

01:04:16.416 --> 01:04:19.207
And that gives you

01:04:19.499 --> 01:04:23.083
that beautiful surrender,

01:04:23.499 --> 01:04:27.291
where you just feel absolutely secured

01:04:29.750 --> 01:04:32.750
in that ocean of love.

01:04:33.541 --> 01:04:36.208
I wish you all to achieve that state.

01:04:37.208 --> 01:04:40.666
May God bless you.
