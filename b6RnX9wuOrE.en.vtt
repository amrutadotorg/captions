00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:11.250
..blind folded.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.584
But you have to keep your mind open like a scientist

00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:21.083
to understand

00:00:21.626 --> 00:00:25.626
we have not yet found out the absolute truth.

00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:29.626
We live in a relative world

00:00:29.876 --> 00:00:34.209
and that's why we have problems.

00:00:35.667 --> 00:00:39.083
So many problems we face today,

00:00:39.334 --> 00:00:43.667
ecological problems are there, drug problems, sickness, this, that.

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:48.125
And as if we feel

00:00:48.584 --> 00:00:54.751
there is a kind of a destructive force that is working

00:00:57.292 --> 00:01:02.083
and we are really bothered,

00:01:03.209 --> 00:01:05.918
some are frightened

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:12.083
who understand the devastation that is possible.

00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:19.250
The reason for all these problems

00:01:19.375 --> 00:01:22.000
is very simple

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.292
and if we can just go

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:33.459
into the scriptures of all the religions,

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.000
there is one common point about them.

00:01:40.584 --> 00:01:41.876
The common thing,

00:01:42.083 --> 00:01:46.667
all of them have said in essence one thing,

00:01:47.083 --> 00:01:52.209
and they have said that you have to seek the eternal.

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:54.918
Seek the eternal!

00:01:55.125 --> 00:01:58.542
Not take it for granted that you have got it.

00:01:58.876 --> 00:02:01.417
Seek the eternal

00:02:01.667 --> 00:02:05.959
and the transitory is to be used

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.042
in its own limitations and understanding.

00:02:10.792 --> 00:02:13.876
Here we have gone wrong

00:02:14.083 --> 00:02:19.834
because we have worried too much about transitory things

00:02:20.501 --> 00:02:23.584
and nothing about the eternal.

00:02:25.626 --> 00:02:28.959
The transitory things are transitory

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:36.959
because it has got the build in quality of getting destroyed.

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:38.959
That's why they are transitory

00:02:39.083 --> 00:02:43.042
otherwise they would have been eternal.

00:02:43.876 --> 00:02:47.876
This build in quality in the transitory things

00:02:48.083 --> 00:02:51.959
brings in all kinds of problems.

00:02:54.209 --> 00:03:01.876
When we look at these problems

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.834
we have to look back and see

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.334
that by seeking eternal, how the solution can come.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:18.292
It's said in all religions that you have to be born again.

00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:28.167
That means they have indicated that we have to have

00:03:28.542 --> 00:03:35.209
a more - greater dimension,

00:03:35.334 --> 00:03:39.000
a more awakened state

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.501
or a greater dimension of awareness.

00:03:43.876 --> 00:03:48.834
Not that to certify yourself as "we are born again".

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.501
If you just want to certify yourself

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.918
and want to live in ignorance

00:03:54.042 --> 00:03:58.209
and a blind following another blind, is not going to work out.

00:03:58.542 --> 00:04:03.334
One has to accept that so far

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.167
we have not found the absolute

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:13.000
and that to find that absolute

00:04:13.417 --> 00:04:21.375
we have to actualize the second birth.

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:28.000
Is not some sort of an artificial baptism that is going to work out:

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.250
Our fathers were baptised and their fathers were baptised

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:33.792
and we have been baptised and baptised and baptised.

00:04:34.083 --> 00:04:36.667
In every religion they have some sort of

00:04:36.792 --> 00:04:39.542
an artificial method of baptism,

00:04:40.167 --> 00:04:43.501
whether it's Hindu, Christian, Muslims, everybody has.

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:48.083
But nobody has actualized

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:51.918
and that actualization has to take place,

00:04:54.334 --> 00:04:59.000
for which the Creator must have

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:02.709
created something great within us.

00:05:03.918 --> 00:05:08.834
When we see the civilisation outside

00:05:09.542 --> 00:05:14.792
and then we realize that there is something wrong in it,

00:05:15.501 --> 00:05:21.250
we have to know that this outside growths

00:05:21.542 --> 00:05:24.542
is like a tree growing outward.

00:05:24.792 --> 00:05:29.626
But the roots must be nourished, we must know the roots.

00:05:29.834 --> 00:05:34.000
And this is the knowledge of the roots.

00:05:34.626 --> 00:05:39.250
Now you have to take it as a hypotheses whatever I am saying to you.

00:05:39.501 --> 00:05:41.667
Not to take it for granted.

00:05:41.918 --> 00:05:45.417
It's a hypotheses.

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:50.626
If it works then in all your honesty you have to accept it.

00:05:50.792 --> 00:05:53.667
It is being said

00:05:55.292 --> 00:05:58.125
by Jung, has said it clearly

00:05:58.292 --> 00:06:02.918
that you have to get your Self-realization

00:06:03.375 --> 00:06:09.042
by which you will have collective consciousness,

00:06:09.209 --> 00:06:13.292
a new dimension to your awareness.

00:06:14.542 --> 00:06:18.292
Or we say, we are all brothers, alright,

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:22.709
every country is one country, God has created one world,

00:06:22.959 --> 00:06:26.125
they talk of United Nations and all that,

00:06:26.375 --> 00:06:30.334
but they are not.

00:06:31.042 --> 00:06:33.167
Let something happen and you will find

00:06:33.334 --> 00:06:37.501
all of them are hither and thither.

00:06:39.542 --> 00:06:46.042
Why? Why it happens this way that we cannot

00:06:47.334 --> 00:06:51.209
see that unity in people who talk about it?

00:06:51.417 --> 00:06:55.250
We cannot feel that peace about which they talk?

00:06:55.626 --> 00:06:57.751
They have got peace foundations and

00:06:57.918 --> 00:07:00.209
they have got all kinds of organisations,

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:04.292
talking of big, big things, but we don't find that

00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:09.542
those who are running them have any peace within themselves.

00:07:10.667 --> 00:07:15.334
So with unreal things we cannot create reality.

00:07:18.584 --> 00:07:22.250
Thus we have to realise that

00:07:22.417 --> 00:07:26.959
the time has come for us to take our second birth.

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:31.167
If we want to have any meaning to our life,

00:07:31.459 --> 00:07:36.584
to our human life, we have to have our second birth.

00:07:36.959 --> 00:07:39.417
If we cannot have our second birth

00:07:39.542 --> 00:07:42.751
our life is a waste, it has no meaning.

00:07:43.209 --> 00:07:47.042
Now the second birth is -

00:07:47.375 --> 00:07:51.876
I would say that in India, in Sanskrit language

00:07:52.042 --> 00:07:58.792
we call a person who is twice born as "vijaha", is the born twice.

00:07:59.209 --> 00:08:04.167
And the one who is born again also is called "vijaha",

00:08:04.626 --> 00:08:08.334
Self-realized. A person who is born again is "vijaha".

00:08:08.667 --> 00:08:12.751
And also a bird is called as "vijaha",

00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:19.334
means the bird which is an egg first and it has a second birth

00:08:19.667 --> 00:08:26.709
and by that second birth he becomes the real bird.

00:08:26.792 --> 00:08:30.167
First the egg and then the bird.

00:08:30.959 --> 00:08:34.042
This kind of second birth

00:08:34.375 --> 00:08:39.918
has to actualize within us.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.250
You try anything else - lecturing, sermoning,

00:08:47.584 --> 00:08:51.334
doing all kinds of things that people do-

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.292
is not going to work out.

00:08:54.626 --> 00:09:00.375
Because it's a living process of living energy of God.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:07.501
The living process works spontaneously, as like a seed,

00:09:07.834 --> 00:09:12.626
you have to just put it in the Mother Earth and it sprouts by itself.

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:16.584
It sprouts - you can't say how,

00:09:16.834 --> 00:09:21.792
because the Mother Earth has got the potential

00:09:22.209 --> 00:09:24.876
and the seed has got the build in power.

00:09:24.959 --> 00:09:30.250
In the same way we all are build in to be that.

00:09:32.626 --> 00:09:38.250
Now Sahaja Yoga -" saha" means with, "ja" means with you is born -

00:09:38.501 --> 00:09:43.501
is the right to be united with the Divine Power

00:09:43.626 --> 00:09:45.542
which is all pervading.

00:09:45.834 --> 00:09:50.918
Now when I talk of all pervading power of divine love

00:09:51.083 --> 00:09:53.250
people might say, Mother is talking something

00:09:53.375 --> 00:09:55.000
which we don't believe in.

00:09:55.209 --> 00:09:58.292
You believe in it or not - it is so.

00:09:58.375 --> 00:10:02.334
Now see these flowers, it's a miracle.

00:10:02.918 --> 00:10:06.375
We can't create even one!

00:10:06.542 --> 00:10:08.584
Who does this work?

00:10:08.918 --> 00:10:13.709
And the choice - the roses will have roses,

00:10:14.167 --> 00:10:16.709
jasmin will have jasmin,

00:10:17.042 --> 00:10:19.417
chrysanthemums will have chrysanthemums.

00:10:19.709 --> 00:10:22.292
Who does this choice?

00:10:22.709 --> 00:10:25.501
Done by this divine power

00:10:25.876 --> 00:10:28.918
which is very subtle and all pervading.

00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:34.292
Only after realization you can feel that power

00:10:34.375 --> 00:10:37.209
as cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:10:37.459 --> 00:10:40.501
because that power is the Holy Spirit.

00:10:40.834 --> 00:10:45.834
That power is the one which we call it in Sanskrit language

00:10:46.083 --> 00:10:48.250
as Brahmachaitanya.

00:10:49.959 --> 00:10:56.083
That power acts and works out all these wonderful things.

00:10:56.584 --> 00:11:01.125
Now in our evolutionary process we have reached the human stage.

00:11:01.584 --> 00:11:05.000
We have to go little further to achieve it.

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:08.542
It's a very easy thing to do,

00:11:08.876 --> 00:11:13.918
it can be easily done, takes hardly any time.

00:11:15.250 --> 00:11:21.083
And I have to say that no amount of arguments

00:11:21.334 --> 00:11:25.792
can bring forth this happening, it has to work out within yourself.

00:11:26.334 --> 00:11:33.667
As a result of that you yourself in that enlightenment

00:11:33.834 --> 00:11:36.209
know so many things

00:11:36.334 --> 00:11:40.417
and that in that enlightenment

00:11:40.626 --> 00:11:46.375
you know what is the Absolute and what is not.

00:11:46.834 --> 00:11:49.584
In a way we can say, you become a saint.

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:54.584
A saint, who doesn't give up his family, his houses, anything.

00:11:54.834 --> 00:11:57.667
He lives as he has to live with his own status,

00:11:57.792 --> 00:12:02.209
with his own family life, with whatever it is.

00:12:02.375 --> 00:12:06.209
Supposing Christ was born in a rich family,

00:12:06.501 --> 00:12:09.918
He would have lived like a king, in complete detachment.

00:12:10.334 --> 00:12:16.542
And if He was born in a poor family, as He was born,

00:12:16.751 --> 00:12:19.125
He lived like a carpenter's son.

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:24.042
Because such a person has no attachment to things

00:12:24.751 --> 00:12:30.375
and is not bothered as to what is important to other people.

00:12:31.709 --> 00:12:35.083
What is the most important thing for such a person

00:12:35.334 --> 00:12:37.876
is the benevolence of others.

00:12:38.083 --> 00:12:40.542
He looks after the benevolence.

00:12:40.834 --> 00:12:46.542
And the benevolence is done not by money,

00:12:47.042 --> 00:12:51.375
by talking sweetly

00:12:51.542 --> 00:12:57.083
but actually through the power that He has

00:12:57.375 --> 00:13:00.167
of vibratory awareness.

00:13:00.751 --> 00:13:04.167
Such a person has such innocent eyes

00:13:04.459 --> 00:13:11.834
that even a glance of that eye can do wonders.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:16.292
Now through your Kundalini awakening

00:13:16.501 --> 00:13:21.250
people have been cured definitely of cancer

00:13:21.542 --> 00:13:23.584
and of so many diseases.

00:13:23.751 --> 00:13:27.667
And in Delhi University for your information there are three doctors

00:13:27.834 --> 00:13:32.417
who have done their MD

00:13:32.626 --> 00:13:36.417
with the theses on three subjects:

00:13:36.667 --> 00:13:42.834
one with the physical abilities in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:43.501 --> 00:13:48.375
second epilepsy cured by Kundalini awakening

00:13:48.667 --> 00:13:54.417
and third for psychosomatic diseases.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:58.918
Psychosomatic diseases means

00:13:59.250 --> 00:14:02.751
so many diseases which are supposed to be incurable

00:14:02.876 --> 00:14:08.876
like Parkinson, cancer, aids.

00:14:09.292 --> 00:14:11.959
And they have got their MDs.

00:14:13.792 --> 00:14:16.584
Now in America as you know there is a law that

00:14:16.751 --> 00:14:22.417
nobody can cure without the permission of your associations.

00:14:22.667 --> 00:14:24.083
But you don't do anything.

00:14:24.167 --> 00:14:28.167
Actually your Kundalini itself rises,

00:14:28.375 --> 00:14:31.501
it's your own power that rises!

00:14:32.125 --> 00:14:35.709
And you get just cured.

00:14:36.042 --> 00:14:40.792
And how you get cured that I'll be telling you tomorrow,

00:14:40.959 --> 00:14:46.000
how it works physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually,

00:14:46.751 --> 00:14:50.501
and how you become a different personality,

00:14:50.709 --> 00:14:53.334
a special personality,

00:14:53.542 --> 00:14:57.000
who is endowed with collective consciousness

00:14:57.167 --> 00:15:01.083
that you can feel the centres of another person and your own centres

00:15:01.209 --> 00:15:04.792
and that you can raise the Kundalini of another person.

00:15:05.209 --> 00:15:09.501
All these things can happen to you

00:15:09.792 --> 00:15:14.042
and you can become that powerful person

00:15:14.292 --> 00:15:17.959
as been described in the scriptures.

00:15:18.250 --> 00:15:20.667
So today for the time being

00:15:20.792 --> 00:15:26.459
let us think of getting your realization.

00:15:26.918 --> 00:15:32.417
And tomorrow again I'll tell you how these diseases can be cured

00:15:32.584 --> 00:15:35.584
if we can get these centres

00:15:35.751 --> 00:15:40.167
enriched and nourished by Kundalini awakening.

00:15:40.334 --> 00:15:44.626
Talking about Sahaja Yoga and Kundalini

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:48.542
is very easy and anybody can talk about it.

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:53.417
But the main thing is to get your Self-realization.

00:15:53.751 --> 00:15:57.542
I must have spoken in various places

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.709
and thousands of lectures I must have given.

00:16:02.209 --> 00:16:08.292
But that is of no avail because

00:16:08.459 --> 00:16:13.083
by lecturing you cannot get your realization.

00:16:13.709 --> 00:16:15.918
There is no end to this knowledge

00:16:16.167 --> 00:16:20.501
but as for opening these lights you have to just switch on one light,

00:16:20.584 --> 00:16:22.209
one switch,

00:16:22.584 --> 00:16:25.834
in the same way it's all build in within you,

00:16:26.042 --> 00:16:28.918
only thing - you have to get it

00:16:29.209 --> 00:16:32.834
and you have to feel this all pervading power.

00:16:33.626 --> 00:16:36.792
So now I think let's have the experience,

00:16:36.918 --> 00:16:38.709
will be the best idea.

00:16:38.918 --> 00:16:41.542
And if you have any questions

00:16:41.626 --> 00:16:46.459
you may write them and give it to us.

00:16:46.709 --> 00:16:50.584
Tomorrow I hope to answer all your questions.

00:16:50.834 --> 00:16:55.918
So I hope you like to have your realization first.

00:16:56.334 --> 00:16:58.709
Is it all right?

00:17:04.834 --> 00:17:08.125
I think those people who are very much far away could come forward,

00:17:08.375 --> 00:17:11.334
would be better idea, this side.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.709
Today is a very good day with Father's Day and

00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:49.751
is also the day of our Creator.

00:18:37.584 --> 00:18:41.000
Anyone can come here just to show?

00:18:41.584 --> 00:18:42.584
All right.

00:18:46.292 --> 00:18:50.125
You'll have to show where to put hands and things like that.

00:18:50.334 --> 00:18:52.959
Is a very simple thing is that

00:18:53.542 --> 00:18:56.459
first you have to take out your shoes

00:18:56.584 --> 00:19:00.292
because Mother Earth helps us a lot to take out our problems.

00:19:07.751 --> 00:19:10.125
Now, it's a very simple method,

00:19:10.334 --> 00:19:12.876
you don't have to do much.

00:19:13.209 --> 00:19:18.459
But on the very outset there is one condition

00:19:20.125 --> 00:19:26.959
that you have not to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

00:19:27.209 --> 00:19:32.083
Forget the past and please don't feel guilty.

00:19:34.876 --> 00:19:37.667
Please don't feel guilty.

00:19:37.876 --> 00:19:39.417
Forget the past.

00:19:39.626 --> 00:19:42.626
You have to be very pleasantly placed towards yourself

00:19:43.834 --> 00:19:47.626
because we have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:19:48.918 --> 00:19:52.417
And we should not condemn ourselves.

00:19:53.501 --> 00:19:56.584
After all we are human beings, we are not God.

00:19:56.918 --> 00:20:00.918
And if we have done any mistakes

00:20:02.751 --> 00:20:07.167
the Divine Love has power to dissolve everything.

00:20:07.667 --> 00:20:12.375
So please be pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:20:14.667 --> 00:20:17.709
Not to feel guilty is very important.

00:20:17.914 --> 00:20:19.584
And it's a fashion also these days

00:20:19.806 --> 00:20:22.722
just to feel guilty for nothing at all.

00:20:25.334 --> 00:20:28.709
After all, if you have done something really serious

00:20:28.834 --> 00:20:31.959
we would be in jail, we would not have been here.

00:20:32.876 --> 00:20:35.667
So please do not judge yourself.

00:20:37.626 --> 00:20:40.417
Please do not judge yourself

00:20:40.876 --> 00:20:44.417
and have that respect for yourself.

00:20:49.250 --> 00:20:54.209
Another request is that

00:20:56.292 --> 00:20:58.918
as we have to forget the past,

00:20:59.209 --> 00:21:01.876
we have to forgive everyone.

00:21:02.375 --> 00:21:04.626
That's something difficult I think.

00:21:04.834 --> 00:21:08.292
In the west I found, wherever I had programs,

00:21:08.459 --> 00:21:14.667
every time I had to attend to them to see that they forgive.

00:21:16.626 --> 00:21:20.083
But logically, what do we do?

00:21:21.876 --> 00:21:24.667
Wether we forgive or we don't forgive,

00:21:24.876 --> 00:21:28.209
we really don't do anything, do we?

00:21:29.876 --> 00:21:32.959
So why to

00:21:33.167 --> 00:21:37.834
go on pondering about something which bothers you?

00:21:38.125 --> 00:21:43.083
If you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands.

00:21:44.209 --> 00:21:48.542
So please try to forgive every one.

00:21:49.125 --> 00:21:52.751
Just forgive, just a lip-service call it.

00:21:52.876 --> 00:21:55.834
Just say, I forgive everyone.

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.501
In your heart you have to say it.

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:03.626
Please forgive.

00:22:03.834 --> 00:22:06.375
And don't remember whom you have to forgive.

00:22:06.709 --> 00:22:10.751
Just take out that from your mind completely.

00:22:12.042 --> 00:22:20.042
Let no such memory which makes you unhappy be there lingering.

00:22:20.959 --> 00:22:22.417
All right.

00:22:22.667 --> 00:22:26.292
These are the only two things we have to do

00:22:26.542 --> 00:22:30.959
as far as your own attitude is concerned.

00:22:32.667 --> 00:22:35.375
Now we have to know that it is all build in within us,

00:22:35.584 --> 00:22:39.751
it's all your own and it will work out on its own.

00:22:40.083 --> 00:22:41.083
So

00:22:46.751 --> 00:22:50.042
we don't have to put in much effort, only thing,

00:22:50.209 --> 00:22:55.334
I would like to tell you how we can raise our own Kundalini

00:22:55.501 --> 00:22:59.292
and how

00:22:59.792 --> 00:23:02.792
we have to release our own centres,

00:23:03.167 --> 00:23:06.709
which is a very simple method, even a child can do it.

00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.417
So first of all we have to put the left hand towards Me like this,

00:23:13.417 --> 00:23:19.834
because left hand is symbolically suggesting that

00:23:20.125 --> 00:23:23.375
we desire to have our Self-realization.

00:23:23.542 --> 00:23:27.167
So just put your left hand towards Me - all of you please do it.

00:23:27.334 --> 00:23:30.626
Just put your left hand towards Me.

00:23:31.125 --> 00:23:34.626
And put both the feet on the ground separately

00:23:34.751 --> 00:23:37.459
because these are two powers, left and right power,

00:23:37.667 --> 00:23:40.709
which I will tell you tomorrow exactly what it is.

00:23:42.125 --> 00:23:45.626
Now, put your left hand just like this.

00:23:48.167 --> 00:23:51.626
And the right hand represents the action.

00:23:52.042 --> 00:23:55.918
So with the right hand we have to

00:23:56.209 --> 00:23:59.209
touch our different centres,

00:23:59.459 --> 00:24:06.125
just to release any blockade if there is.

00:24:08.250 --> 00:24:15.125
First thing will be to put your right hand on your heart.

00:24:15.417 --> 00:24:17.626
This I am showing you just now

00:24:17.751 --> 00:24:24.501
and then we'll have to close our eyes and do the same thing.

00:24:24.918 --> 00:24:29.292
So first is to put your hand on your heart.

00:24:33.459 --> 00:24:37.000
This is the centre where resides the Spirit.

00:24:37.709 --> 00:24:40.042
The Spirit - Atma.

00:24:41.501 --> 00:24:46.834
Now you have to put down your right hand

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.334
in the upper portion of your stomach

00:24:51.501 --> 00:24:55.918
on the left hand side. We are working on the left hand side.

00:24:57.417 --> 00:25:02.083
So put it on the left hand side,

00:25:03.042 --> 00:25:05.709
your right hand.

00:25:06.209 --> 00:25:09.918
This is the centre of your mastery,

00:25:12.125 --> 00:25:16.876
mastery which is created by many prophets,

00:25:17.250 --> 00:25:23.375
by which you master the art of divine love,

00:25:25.375 --> 00:25:28.834
by which you become your own master.

00:25:30.375 --> 00:25:33.250
Then you have to take this hand

00:25:33.501 --> 00:25:38.876
in the lower part of the abdomen on the left hand side.

00:25:39.751 --> 00:25:43.709
And here

00:25:43.918 --> 00:25:48.292
is the centre of pure knowledge,

00:25:49.876 --> 00:25:54.083
pure knowledge that manifests

00:25:54.292 --> 00:25:57.083
through your central nervous system.

00:25:58.501 --> 00:26:02.083
It becomes your own knowledge

00:26:02.292 --> 00:26:05.501
as you can feel cold, hot

00:26:05.792 --> 00:26:10.000
you can feel the good and bad.

00:26:13.375 --> 00:26:16.375
Then again you have to take back your hand

00:26:16.667 --> 00:26:21.167
onto the upper portion of the abdomen,

00:26:21.375 --> 00:26:26.292
and then again to your heart.

00:26:31.292 --> 00:26:34.876
Then you have to take your right hand

00:26:35.083 --> 00:26:39.334
in the corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:26:39.626 --> 00:26:43.083
and place it

00:26:43.334 --> 00:26:45.375
as much as possible

00:26:45.626 --> 00:26:47.918
towards the spinal cord.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:51.250
And turn your head to your right.

00:26:53.042 --> 00:26:57.834
This centre catches when we feel guilty.

00:26:58.459 --> 00:27:01.292
And which is a very dangerous thing

00:27:01.626 --> 00:27:06.501
because by this centre blocked

00:27:06.751 --> 00:27:10.417
we get horrible diseases like angina,

00:27:10.584 --> 00:27:16.125
spondylitis and all kinds of negative thoughts come into our mind.

00:27:16.417 --> 00:27:21.792
So please put your right hand on

00:27:23.209 --> 00:27:26.125
the corner of your neck and your shoulder

00:27:26.250 --> 00:27:28.459
and turn your head to your right.

00:27:28.751 --> 00:27:29.751
Now

00:27:31.250 --> 00:27:36.250
put your right hand on top of your forehead across

00:27:36.584 --> 00:27:40.918
and bend your head and press it on both the sides.

00:27:41.626 --> 00:27:44.751
This is the centre of forgiveness.

00:27:46.125 --> 00:27:50.000
Now, take your right hand and put it back

00:27:50.209 --> 00:27:52.584
on the backside of your head.

00:27:53.083 --> 00:27:56.959
And put your head on it to rest,

00:27:57.250 --> 00:28:01.292
take it upward.

00:28:03.876 --> 00:28:08.250
This is the centre where you have to ask for forgiveness

00:28:08.459 --> 00:28:11.959
without feeling guilty, without counting your mistakes.

00:28:12.375 --> 00:28:15.834
Then you have to stretch your hand fully.

00:28:16.501 --> 00:28:18.334
Now stretch your hand please.

00:28:18.834 --> 00:28:21.918
The centre of your palm

00:28:22.834 --> 00:28:25.918
you have to put it on top of

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.209
the soft bone which you had in your childhood,

00:28:29.292 --> 00:28:32.042
called as the fontanel bone area.

00:28:32.209 --> 00:28:34.042
Press it hard,

00:28:34.250 --> 00:28:37.125
push back your fingers,

00:28:37.375 --> 00:28:39.083
put down your head

00:28:39.334 --> 00:28:44.667
and move your scalp seven times clockwise, very slowly.

00:28:45.209 --> 00:28:46.667
That's all.

00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.792
Very slowly you have to move it.

00:28:50.584 --> 00:28:52.542
Seven times.

00:29:02.667 --> 00:29:07.000
That's all we have to do. Now please close your eyes.

00:29:07.209 --> 00:29:13.626
You can take out your spectacles. Be comfortable and

00:29:16.083 --> 00:29:19.042
don't open your eyes please 'till I tell you

00:29:19.167 --> 00:29:22.292
because your attention has to be sucked in.

00:29:22.542 --> 00:29:24.709
So please don't open your eyes.

00:29:24.876 --> 00:29:26.834
There will be no problem,

00:29:27.042 --> 00:29:29.417
there will be

00:29:31.334 --> 00:29:36.918
no funny happening as some people fear,

00:29:37.334 --> 00:29:41.584
is absolutely the smooth moving of the Kundalini

00:29:41.918 --> 00:29:44.250
'till you will start feeling the cool breeze

00:29:44.334 --> 00:29:47.334
coming out of your fontanel bone area.

00:29:47.501 --> 00:29:49.417
And also you will start feeling

00:29:49.459 --> 00:29:52.792
this all pervading power of cool breeze.

00:29:53.292 --> 00:29:55.626
This is the beginning

00:29:56.167 --> 00:30:00.167
but later on we'll have to make this connection all right.

00:30:02.834 --> 00:30:06.626
So please put your left hand towards Me

00:30:07.292 --> 00:30:09.125
and close your eyes

00:30:09.334 --> 00:30:13.751
and put the right hand on your heart.

00:30:15.167 --> 00:30:17.250
Here

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.542
you have to say within your heart,

00:30:25.209 --> 00:30:29.626
or you have to ask Me a very fundamental question,

00:30:30.834 --> 00:30:37.459
you may call Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever suits you.

00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.501
Please ask the question three times,

00:30:44.209 --> 00:30:48.209
Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:30:48.751 --> 00:30:52.501
Please ask this question three times.

00:31:11.584 --> 00:31:13.626
Now if you are the Spirit,

00:31:13.751 --> 00:31:17.959
also you are your master, you are your guide.

00:31:18.542 --> 00:31:25.459
So please take down your hand onto the upper portion of your abdomen

00:31:25.792 --> 00:31:28.792
and press it hard.

00:31:33.375 --> 00:31:37.626
Here again ask Me a question three times,

00:31:43.751 --> 00:31:47.417
Mother, am I my own master?

00:31:50.709 --> 00:31:54.459
Ask this question three times.

00:32:08.334 --> 00:32:12.751
Now take down your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen,

00:32:15.209 --> 00:32:17.626
on the left hand side.

00:32:19.876 --> 00:32:25.083
Here is the centre of pure knowledge.

00:32:26.918 --> 00:32:29.709
But I cannot force on you.

00:32:29.876 --> 00:32:32.918
I respect your freedom.

00:32:33.334 --> 00:32:37.626
In your freedom and glory you have to ask for it.

00:32:38.167 --> 00:32:39.709
So please say,

00:32:39.959 --> 00:32:44.667
Mother, please give me pure knowledge.

00:32:45.042 --> 00:32:48.375
I want pure knowledge.

00:32:48.918 --> 00:32:51.417
You have to ask for it.

00:32:52.501 --> 00:32:54.751
Say it six times

00:32:55.083 --> 00:32:58.751
because this centre has got six petals.

00:33:04.292 --> 00:33:08.209
Now, when you say that,

00:33:08.584 --> 00:33:11.542
your Kundalini starts moving upwards

00:33:11.918 --> 00:33:19.751
and so we have to now open the higher centres.

00:33:23.417 --> 00:33:26.959
So raise your hand, right hand,

00:33:27.167 --> 00:33:33.209
and put it in the upper part of the abdomen and press it hard.

00:33:37.459 --> 00:33:42.167
Now here

00:33:42.667 --> 00:33:46.751
we have to help to open this centre.

00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:52.501
So with full confidence you say ten times,

00:33:52.584 --> 00:33:56.792
with full confidence you have to say ten times,

00:33:57.042 --> 00:34:02.000
Mother, I am my own master. Please say it.

00:34:03.542 --> 00:34:08.125
Mother, I am my own master.

00:34:25.626 --> 00:34:29.292
Now raise your hand

00:34:37.250 --> 00:34:40.709
on your heart

00:34:42.375 --> 00:34:46.167
which is the most important

00:34:47.334 --> 00:34:51.042
centre because the Spirit resides in it.

00:34:52.918 --> 00:34:56.167
You are not this body,

00:34:56.417 --> 00:34:59.459
you are not this mind,

00:34:59.667 --> 00:35:02.542
you are not this intellect,

00:35:05.417 --> 00:35:09.501
you are not the conditioning,

00:35:09.959 --> 00:35:12.501
you are not your ego,

00:35:12.626 --> 00:35:16.626
but you are pure Spirit.

00:35:17.542 --> 00:35:19.501
So here you ask,

00:35:24.417 --> 00:35:30.167
twelve times you have to say it here,

00:35:31.417 --> 00:35:38.042
with full confidence twelve times,

00:35:38.959 --> 00:35:42.250
The greatest truth about yourself,

00:35:42.626 --> 00:35:47.876
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:35:49.459 --> 00:35:53.626
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:36:16.083 --> 00:36:21.918
We have to know that the Divine is the ocean

00:36:24.167 --> 00:36:28.584
of love and compassion.

00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:33.375
It is the ocean of bliss and joy.

00:36:34.083 --> 00:36:36.167
But above all

00:36:36.501 --> 00:36:40.667
it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.375
So we cannot commit any mistakes

00:36:44.626 --> 00:36:49.834
which cannot be dissolved by this great ocean of forgiveness.

00:36:50.292 --> 00:36:57.250
So please raise your right hand in the corner of your

00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:03.459
shoulder and your neck and press it hard.

00:37:03.751 --> 00:37:06.792
Turn your head to the right.

00:37:10.125 --> 00:37:17.709
Here with full confidence please say sixteen times, sixteen times,

00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.375
Mother, I am not guilty.

00:37:21.542 --> 00:37:23.918
Please have confidence in yourself

00:37:24.209 --> 00:37:27.501
and say it, Mother I'm not guilty.

00:37:28.592 --> 00:37:31.531
All these ideas that you are a sinner, you are this,

00:37:31.650 --> 00:37:34.918
please forget it! That's all nonsense!

00:37:35.083 --> 00:37:36.834
You are a human being

00:37:37.042 --> 00:37:40.918
and you have to become a Self-realized personality.

00:37:41.209 --> 00:37:42.709
That's what it is.

00:37:42.876 --> 00:37:50.459
So please say sixteen times, Mother, I' not guilty at all.

00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.417
As I have told you that

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:09.834
whether we forgive or don't forgive,

00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.667
we do not do anything. It's just a myth.

00:38:16.125 --> 00:38:19.625
So we should forgive

00:38:19.934 --> 00:38:24.626
because if we don't forgive we play into wrong hands

00:38:24.767 --> 00:38:26.292
because of this myth.

00:38:26.459 --> 00:38:28.542
We think that we have not forgiven,

00:38:28.709 --> 00:38:31.792
how can we forgive, it is rather difficult.

00:38:31.918 --> 00:38:34.584
But there is nothing difficult about it.

00:38:37.125 --> 00:38:42.292
Now please raise your right hand

00:38:42.501 --> 00:38:46.709
onto your forehead across,

00:38:46.834 --> 00:38:49.626
place it across and bend it down

00:38:49.959 --> 00:38:53.042
and press it on both the sides.

00:38:53.250 --> 00:38:57.542
Here is the centre where you have to forgive.

00:38:57.667 --> 00:38:59.667
So please from your heart,

00:38:59.918 --> 00:39:03.167
please from your heart forgive everyone.

00:39:03.334 --> 00:39:07.626
Please from your heart, otherwise it doesn't work out,

00:39:08.042 --> 00:39:10.959
Realization doesn't work out,

00:39:11.125 --> 00:39:15.959
the Kundalini stops at this centre which is very important.

00:39:16.292 --> 00:39:18.542
Please, please forgive!

00:39:18.792 --> 00:39:22.751
Forgive everyone, I request you again and again,

00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:26.792
please forgive everyone, very important!

00:39:27.250 --> 00:39:31.876
That's the biggest blockade I think, I faced.

00:39:39.542 --> 00:39:45.792
Now, take back your hand and put it on the backside of your head

00:39:46.375 --> 00:39:51.292
and push your head on it.

00:39:53.125 --> 00:39:55.501
Here now you have to say,

00:39:55.709 --> 00:40:01.375
O Divine if I have done any mistakes, please forgive!

00:40:01.667 --> 00:40:06.334
But you are not to feel guilty,

00:40:06.542 --> 00:40:10.584
you are not to count your mistakes. It's for your satisfaction.

00:40:10.834 --> 00:40:15.459
Just say, If I have done any mistakes, please forgive!

00:40:15.792 --> 00:40:20.584
From your heart, how many times is not the point.

00:40:31.292 --> 00:40:33.167
Now stretch your hand please,

00:40:33.375 --> 00:40:35.334
put left hand towards Me.

00:40:35.459 --> 00:40:39.334
Stretch your hand and the centre of your palm

00:40:39.459 --> 00:40:45.876
please carefully put it on the fontanel bone area

00:40:46.083 --> 00:40:50.375
or the soft bone which you had in your childhood.

00:40:50.667 --> 00:40:52.459
The centre of your palm.

00:40:52.667 --> 00:40:55.918
Push back your fingers as much as you can.

00:40:56.375 --> 00:41:00.792
And now you have to move your scalp very slowly,

00:41:00.876 --> 00:41:04.125
very slowly clockwise,

00:41:04.459 --> 00:41:07.834
very slowly clockwise seven times.

00:41:08.167 --> 00:41:13.876
Here again I cannot force Self-realization.

00:41:14.250 --> 00:41:16.501
I cannot force that on you.

00:41:16.667 --> 00:41:19.209
So you have to say,

00:41:19.584 --> 00:41:22.792
Mother please give me my Self-realization.

00:41:22.918 --> 00:41:27.501
I cannot disrespect your freedom.

00:41:27.626 --> 00:41:33.542
So please say it seven times, moving your hand very slowly,

00:41:34.542 --> 00:41:37.834
pressing your scalp, moving your scalp,

00:41:38.042 --> 00:41:42.542
pressing back your fingers. Please do it carefully!

00:41:43.876 --> 00:41:49.876
(Shri Mataji blows into the micro).

00:42:17.959 --> 00:42:22.626
Now please take down your hands

00:42:25.459 --> 00:42:30.125
and open your eyes.

00:42:31.167 --> 00:42:34.667
Just watch Me without thinking - you can do it!

00:42:34.751 --> 00:42:37.584
Just watch Me without thinking.

00:42:44.125 --> 00:42:48.584
Now put the right hand like this and bend your head

00:42:48.834 --> 00:42:50.459
and see for yourself

00:42:50.584 --> 00:42:53.918
if there is a cool breeze coming out of your head.

00:43:00.751 --> 00:43:03.918
Some people might feel a little heat coming out,

00:43:04.042 --> 00:43:07.667
it's all right because heat has to come out first.

00:43:10.584 --> 00:43:16.000
Now put your left hand towards Me, bend your head

00:43:16.167 --> 00:43:19.918
and see for yourself if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:43:20.167 --> 00:43:23.959
It's already very much cooled down, but don't doubt it, just feel.

00:43:24.042 --> 00:43:27.209
Sometimes it comes quite ahead

00:43:27.542 --> 00:43:31.626
but try to put it next to your head

00:43:31.751 --> 00:43:36.250
but not on top,  above it

00:43:36.459 --> 00:43:41.417
and then move further to see if there is a cool breeze coming out.

00:43:49.417 --> 00:43:52.667
Now put back your right hand please.

00:43:52.876 --> 00:43:58.918
And see for yourself again if there is a cool breeze coming out of.

00:44:03.083 --> 00:44:08.292
Don't get upset if it is not there, it will work out.

00:44:08.542 --> 00:44:11.000
Don't get upset, just watch!

00:44:17.292 --> 00:44:22.542
Now push back, push back your hands like this towards the sky,

00:44:22.751 --> 00:44:24.250
push back your head.

00:44:24.501 --> 00:44:30.584
And here you ask a question three times,

00:44:30.709 --> 00:44:32.834
anyone of these questions:

00:44:33.083 --> 00:44:38.501
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

00:44:40.209 --> 00:44:46.501
Mother, is this the all pervading power of Divine Love?

00:44:46.792 --> 00:44:49.626
Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya?

00:44:49.792 --> 00:44:52.584
Ask this question three times.

00:44:52.876 --> 00:44:56.792
Anyone of them, just ask it three times.

00:45:01.834 --> 00:45:05.584
Now take down your hands please.

00:45:10.751 --> 00:45:14.375
Now see, there is no breeze around.

00:45:14.542 --> 00:45:18.792
The trees are silent, they are just watching us.

00:45:19.375 --> 00:45:22.501
But you'll feel the breeze in your hand

00:45:23.042 --> 00:45:26.459
and you must have felt the breeze out of your head also.

00:45:28.584 --> 00:45:34.792
Those who have felt cool breeze coming out of their head,

00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.751
the fontanel bone area or from your fingertips,

00:45:39.918 --> 00:45:43.834
will you please raise your both the hands?

00:45:44.792 --> 00:45:47.250
Please raise higher!

00:45:48.209 --> 00:45:50.459
O my God!

00:45:50.876 --> 00:45:54.584
Practically the whole of San Diego has felt it!

00:45:55.834 --> 00:45:59.501
Tremendous place! Thank you, thank you!

00:46:04.792 --> 00:46:06.417
May God bless you!

00:46:06.584 --> 00:46:10.626
Now don't discuss about it because it is beyond thought.

00:46:11.083 --> 00:46:13.584
You are in thoughtless awareness.

00:46:14.083 --> 00:46:18.959
But tomorrow when you will come then we'll again see about it,

00:46:20.167 --> 00:46:25.751
as I would say, the connection has to be properly fixed.

00:46:26.626 --> 00:46:29.626
For that tomorrow you'll be here

00:46:29.792 --> 00:46:32.792
and I hope there will be a follow on program.

00:46:33.125 --> 00:46:35.876
One must know that you cannot pay for it.

00:46:36.667 --> 00:46:39.417
One must know that you cannot think about it.

00:46:39.626 --> 00:46:42.751
It just happens and is there.

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:50.626
So enjoy this night and every night

00:46:50.792 --> 00:46:53.751
and every moment of your life!

00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:57.209
May God bless you! May God bless you all!

00:47:09.834 --> 00:47:12.918
What does he say?

00:47:22.459 --> 00:47:25.918
They should write it down, questions later, tomorrow morning,

00:47:26.375 --> 00:47:27.501
tomorrow when we come

00:47:27.584 --> 00:47:30.042
because today what I am saying that let them go home,

00:47:30.375 --> 00:47:32.792
tomorrow let them come and  then we'll see about it.

00:47:32.918 --> 00:47:34.167
Today let them go.

00:47:34.292 --> 00:47:38.292
So I would say tonight you can go home, just stressed.

00:47:38.501 --> 00:47:41.584
Don't talk about it, just be in silence.

00:47:41.792 --> 00:47:46.292
This is the thing you have been seeking, which has happened,

00:47:46.375 --> 00:47:49.292
it has worked out but

00:47:49.501 --> 00:47:53.125
we have to understand each and every thing about it,

00:47:53.250 --> 00:47:56.083
the whole knowledge will be given to you.

00:47:56.334 --> 00:47:59.209
Absolutely you will know the whole thing.

00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:02.292
And tomorrow I'll be meeting you, people,

00:48:02.918 --> 00:48:04.876
I will give much more time,

00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.042
I will start much more earlier in a proper way.

00:48:09.334 --> 00:48:15.667
I hope you enjoy this new life

00:48:15.792 --> 00:48:17.375
which is starting now

00:48:17.501 --> 00:48:20.250
and the transformation that will take place,

00:48:20.334 --> 00:48:25.042
you'll be amazed at yourself! Complete transformation!

00:48:26.083 --> 00:48:28.459
Tomorrow we'll talk about it more.

00:48:28.751 --> 00:48:29.876
May God bless you all!

00:48:30.083 --> 00:48:34.167
Now inform your friends and call them here

00:48:34.501 --> 00:48:37.792
and let them also receive this Self-realization.

00:48:38.125 --> 00:48:41.918
It is your own and you all should have it.

00:48:42.042 --> 00:48:44.375
You have a right to have it.

00:48:44.834 --> 00:48:47.167
So may God bless you all!
