1
00:00:14,371 --> 00:00:21,213
Then second thing of Sahaja Yoga is that
it is the power of love,

2
00:00:21,414 --> 00:00:24,855
it’s of compassion, of divine love.

3
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:28,664
Must understand what is divine love is.

4
00:00:28,865 --> 00:00:33,505
That is the love that is the, like the sap,
as I always say,

5
00:00:33,706 --> 00:00:42,799
that runs in the tree. It gives nourishment
to the roots,

6
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:53,846
then to all parts of the tree, and then
it evaporates or it goes down.

7
00:00:54,046 --> 00:01:01,994
Supposing it gets stuck into one flower,
what will happen

8
00:01:02,195 --> 00:01:07,170
that the tree will die, and ultimately
the flower will also die.

9
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:12,882
So our love is not limited love.

10
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:17,212
Like, we love our children, all right,
[we] love other children also.

11
00:01:17,413 --> 00:01:26,640
Everybody is absolutely in full pure love
with each other.

12
00:01:26,841 --> 00:01:35,268
Now, one must understand the pure love,
that it is not attached to anyone,

13
00:01:35,469 --> 00:01:39,471
but at the same time, it is pure love.

14
00:01:39,672 --> 00:01:49,111
If you don’t have pure love in your heart
because the culture is different,

15
00:01:49,326 --> 00:02:01,265
people start moving their attention and
spoiling their attention.

16
00:02:01,741 --> 00:02:05,427
So, so many people asked Me: “Mother,
what to do?”

17
00:02:05,628 --> 00:02:09,789
I said: “Keep your eyes only up to three
feet,

18
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:14,060
so you will see beautiful things, like you
will see flowers,

19
00:02:14,261 --> 00:02:19,558
you will see children, and nothing
horrible”.

20
00:02:19,759 --> 00:02:27,479
So, whatever makes your attention
disturbed, try to avoid.

21
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:33,104
Best is to concentrate on your meditation.

22
00:02:33,663 --> 00:02:40,606
For meditation in the morning you can
just put

23
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:45,420
your right hand towards the photograph

24
00:02:47,985 --> 00:02:51,934
and the left hand up there.

25
00:02:52,215 --> 00:02:58,457
Then put your left hand towards
the photograph… - like this.

26
00:02:58,823 --> 00:03:04,558
Then left hand towards the photograph
and right hand on the Mother Earth.

27
00:03:04,759 --> 00:03:10,644
[It] is better to sit on the ground,
in the morning.

28
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:17,930
Then, if thoughtless awareness is
established

29
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:22,641
by looking at the photograph, close your
eyes.

30
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:27,844
Now, some people say: “Mother, my heart
is not open”. All right.

31
00:03:28,045 --> 00:03:32,682
So you can say, looking at the Mother:

32
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:38,815
“Mother, please, come in my heart.”

33
00:03:39,016 --> 00:03:42,282
Somebody’s Sahasrara is not open.

34
00:03:42,482 --> 00:03:46,622
Then you have to say: “Mother, please
come in my head”.

35
00:03:46,823 --> 00:03:49,592
With both the hands.

36
00:03:49,793 --> 00:03:56,562
Whatever portion you think in the body
is not doing well,

37
00:03:56,763 --> 00:04:02,461
I am always available, so you can ask.

38
00:04:04,565 --> 00:04:07,792
Your meditation should be good, first
and foremost.

39
00:04:07,993 --> 00:04:13,824
If you are good Sahaja Yogis, then only
others will believe you.

40
00:04:14,024 --> 00:04:19,286
But if you are not good Sahaja Yogis,
nobody will believe you.

41
00:04:19,487 --> 00:04:23,728
For so many people I have seen I am
something beyond them.

42
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:28,401
But Sahaja Yogis are the ones which really
make them feel

43
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:32,697
that “these are extraordinary people”.

44
00:04:35,406 --> 00:04:41,548
Then, after that, dealing with them
as I said,

45
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:48,775
has to be absolutely with pure attention.

46
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:52,290
To begin with, the men should deal only
with men

47
00:04:52,491 --> 00:04:56,747
and the women should deal only with women

48
00:04:56,948 --> 00:04:59,979
and no complications should come out.

49
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,349
Because that is the biggest blemish Sahaja
Yoga can have,

50
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:08,837
that they are just like ordinary people.

51
00:05:12,649 --> 00:05:17,092
So, you have to be careful about yourself.

52
00:05:17,293 --> 00:05:21,972
Before sleeping, if you have time, you must
do footsoaking.

53
00:05:22,173 --> 00:05:25,237
If one day you do not do it, don’t torture
yourself for that,

54
00:05:25,438 --> 00:05:29,464
but it’s better that you do footsoaking.

55
00:05:29,665 --> 00:05:34,500
And in footsoaking first of all you
must know

56
00:05:34,701 --> 00:05:38,870
what sort of a personality you have.

57
00:05:39,102 --> 00:05:42,445
Mostly you are right-sided, mostly.

58
00:05:42,646 --> 00:05:45,505
So put [your] right hand towards
the photograph,

59
00:05:45,706 --> 00:05:51,780
both the feet in the water with little salt
and left hand like that.

60
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:55,442
But some are left-sided, some are
definitely very much.

61
00:05:55,643 --> 00:05:58,645
They should not touch water.

62
00:05:58,846 --> 00:06:05,025
Two types of treatments are there.

63
00:06:05,226 --> 00:06:10,167
Especially left-sided people should
not soak,

64
00:06:10,368 --> 00:06:15,663
should not use ice. This is all right-sided
treatment.

65
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:21,216
After doing your right-sided or left-sided
treatment,

66
00:06:21,417 --> 00:06:27,669
I would say you put both your hands towards
the photograph

67
00:06:28,226 --> 00:06:32,897
and see for yourself how it is working out,

68
00:06:34,809 --> 00:06:38,964
without water, without candle.

69
00:06:39,276 --> 00:06:42,985
But I would again say that right-sided
people should not

70
00:06:43,186 --> 00:06:47,133
use candle as far as possible.

71
00:06:49,527 --> 00:06:54,692
This electricity is all right, you can
use it.

72
00:06:54,893 --> 00:06:57,646
They should not sit in the sun, they should
put

73
00:06:57,847 --> 00:07:01,643
ice on their liver; also they can put ice
here

74
00:07:01,844 --> 00:07:05,034
when it is very hot, it’s very good to put
ice here.

75
00:07:05,235 --> 00:07:09,768
Also for diabetes you can put the ice here.

76
00:07:11,345 --> 00:07:14,693
In Sahaja Yoga the treatment is very
simple:

77
00:07:14,894 --> 00:07:19,556
for right-sided people very simple, and
for left-sided.

78
00:07:19,757 --> 00:07:23,974
Right-sided people get problems like liver,

79
00:07:24,175 --> 00:07:30,520
diabetes, blood cancer,

80
00:07:31,878 --> 00:07:35,730
kidney coagulation,

81
00:07:35,931 --> 00:07:41,446
that means they can’t pass urine,
constipation,

82
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:48,634
also asthma, heart attack – massive,

83
00:07:48,835 --> 00:07:58,115
and also paralysis, on the right side;
so many.

84
00:07:58,316 --> 00:08:05,503
Now, the left-sided people get pain
all over left side;

85
00:08:05,704 --> 00:08:12,616
also can get all kinds of psychosomatic
diseases which are not curable,

86
00:08:12,817 --> 00:08:21,718
like cancer, myelitis, Parkinson’s,
all kinds.

87
00:08:23,195 --> 00:08:25,778
But if you do your meditation every day,

88
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,695
once in a while you may miss it, it doesn’t
matter,

89
00:08:28,895 --> 00:08:33,795
you will immediately feel that you are
completely cured

90
00:08:33,996 --> 00:08:37,756
and you keep good health.

91
00:08:37,957 --> 00:08:41,532
That’s the only way you can grow.

92
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:50,045
And try to bring the point where you are
thoughtlessly aware.

93
00:08:50,246 --> 00:08:57,851
The best way to be thoughtless is to say
the mantra of Nirvichara.

94
00:08:58,467 --> 00:09:02,438
That’s very important. And secondly,

95
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:05,230
to go on for forgiving: “I forgive
everyone, I forgive everyone”

96
00:09:05,431 --> 00:09:13,075
so the thoughts will stop. That is the time
when you are in the present.

97
00:09:13,276 --> 00:09:19,429
That is the time really you will grow
in spirituality.
