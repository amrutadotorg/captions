1
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:09,172
Be honest with yourself.

2
00:00:09,344 --> 00:00:14,400
You have no business to cheat yourself, or anything whatsoever.

3
00:00:14,999 --> 00:00:17,160
If you are hypnotized

4
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:19,000
awaken yourself.

5
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,760
arise and find what is the best, absolute

6
00:00:23,999 --> 00:00:28,999
and the only thing that you have to find, your Spirit.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,560
Your Spirit resides in the heart.

8
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:39,760
It is the reflection of God Almighty.

9
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,360
It enjoys itself, by itself.

10
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,999
It is the spectator of the world, of its power,

11
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:52,880
The Holy Ghost.

12
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,000
It watches you

13
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,999
and is called as the knower of the fate.

14
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:06,999
It knows what you are doing,

15
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,680
what are your aspirations,

16
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:12,440
what mistakes you are committing.

17
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
It goes to a long extent

18
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:18,520
to forgive and forgive and forgive.

19
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:22,360
Forgiveness is one of the qualities of the Spirit.

20
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:28,360
It forgives you

21
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,999
and says it will work out.

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,400
It will come around.

23
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,640
But when you go too far,

24
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,120
say if you pay too much attention to your physical being

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,520
or to your mental being,

26
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:46,999
if you try to think too much,

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,999
the Spirit indicates its displeasure

28
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:54,680
and you get a heart attack.

29
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,800
Heart attack comes to you through displeasure of the Spirit.

30
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,160
If the Spirit is angry with you, you get a heart attack.

31
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,999
That means you've neglected your Spirit,

32
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:14,880
you've paid attention to things which are not important.

33
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:18,960
You have looked after things which are not important.

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:23,120
You have not worried about yourself, about the Spirit, about your seeking.

35
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,760
Even if you're lost, say in any fanatic behavior

36
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,120
of reading some books and things and

37
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,240
taking out certain things and remembering them by heart and

38
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,999
having an argument and goes on later all that,

39
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,160
in all genuineness and goodness

40
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,040
but stupidity then also you can get heart attack.

41
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:46,680
Heart is very important.

42
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,960
It sometimes gives you first warning

43
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,999
by giving you a partial paralysis

44
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,520
because in the heart is sort of a,

45
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:03,999
resentment is created by the Spirit which creates a clot,

46
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:08,400
a clot, and that clot when goes into the brain

47
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:11,840
you get a partial paralysis,

48
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,360
so that you do not move any further.

49
00:03:15,999 --> 00:03:17,999
Your attention is taken to it.

50
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:22,480
Then you start thinking of God, thinking of all the things

51
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:28,720
and maybe, if you come to Sahaja yoga you get cured

52
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,999
because again your Spirit forgives you.

53
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:37,999
We are taking too much liberty with our Spirit.

54
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:43,080
It is true God has given you freedom

55
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:47,960
and He is not going to take away your freedom at any cost.

56
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,760
You have to be absolutely free to choose

57
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,440
whether to go to heaven or to go to hell.

58
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,680
He is not going to force you.

59
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,040
Only thing one can do is to explain to you

60
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,120
and tell you that this is the way you go to hell.

61
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:06,360
Even then if you want to go

62
00:04:07,999 --> 00:04:11,440
then what can anybody do about it?

63
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,320
Even God, He doesn't want to challenge your freedom at all.

64
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,120
He doesn't want to make you, in any way

65
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,320
bound to Him, like some people are,

66
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,400
bound just bound, without understanding.

67
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,520
But He wants your complete liberation.

68
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:30,999
So the first stage is that you have to choose your liberation

69
00:04:30,999 --> 00:04:33,640
through your own freedom of choice.

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:37,880
Now, up to this point, till you were human beings,

71
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,160
there was no choice for you,

72
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:43,999
but after becoming a human being

73
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:47,960
you were given the choice because you could develop well

74
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,999
to understand what is right and wrong in your own freedom,

75
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,520
so that you can enter into the Kingdom of God as people

76
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:02,720
who are free and have chosen good in their own glory

77
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,960
and in their own freedom.

78
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,560
This is the only small little step

79
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:16,200
where we always confuse our freedom with our ego.

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,080
For example, now,

81
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:25,080
this hall is here say, for me to speak.

82
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,280
Somebody comes from outside who has been sort of

83
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:34,200
worked up in some sort of an organization and

84
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,600
he thinks he is doing the greatest work in the whole world in such a myth.

85
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:41,200
Comes down here in that ego state,

86
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:43,360
sits down here and asks me

87
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,240
questions after questions, questions after questions, questions after questions,

88
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,999
doesn't allow anybody else to speak,

89
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,480
takes away all my time to himself

90
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,360
as if this hall is booked by him and all the audience is gathered by him.

91
00:05:57,999 --> 00:06:00,520
He is least bother as to see

92
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,800
that this is an ego that is working.

93
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:10,920
So we should not confuse our freedom with ego,

94
00:06:10,999 --> 00:06:13,840
that's what I have to give you a counsel.

95
00:06:13,999 --> 00:06:20,200
Try to differentiate your ego from your freedom.

96
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:24,320
When you are ego bound, you are a slave of your ego.

97
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:28,280
When you are super ego bound, you are slave

98
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:31,000
of your super ego, of your conditioning.

99
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:34,000
For example, you are born a Christian, you are a Christian

100
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,999
you are bound forever then.

101
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:39,880
All right, you are a Christian but what about real Christianity within you.

102
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:43,120
What about your rebirth in the real sense of the word.

103
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,040
So you become enslaved to these things, so there is no freedom.

104
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:55,040
And Spirit is the freedom, is the free

105
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,920
being within us.

106
00:06:58,040 --> 00:07:02,080
It is detached. It cannot be killed.

107
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:07,000
It cannot be blown away. It cannot be burnt away.

108
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:11,800
It is eternal. Anant. It is eternal.

109
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:17,040
That Spirit is joy.

110
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:20,999
That Spirit is the source of joy,

111
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,040
that emits joy.

112
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:29,960
Joy is different from happiness and unhappiness.

113
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,999
Ego, when it feels pampered, it feels happy.

114
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:36,920
I like it, I like it.

115
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,280
This "I" business

116
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,120
is ego pampering,

117
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,999
that is no joy. Because you like to drink today

118
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,720
and tomorrow you don't like to have a headache.

119
00:07:50,999 --> 00:07:54,480
It has the double side of I like and I don't like.

120
00:07:55,999 --> 00:08:02,280
You like something through your ego, dislike through your super ego.

121
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,800
So it is a one coin

122
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:10,480
and there are two faces, one is happiness and another is unhappiness.

123
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:14,999
Joy is beyond that. Joy is a drama,

124
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:20,680
seer, is a witness. You see a drama. You know it's a drama going on.

125
00:08:20,920 --> 00:08:24,000
You just watch it as a drama. You're not involved

126
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:26,480
and you are seeing it and enjoying it.

127
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,680
You are crying if you see something, you're

128
00:08:28,920 --> 00:08:31,600
weeping but you know you are not that, it's a drama.

129
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:33,840
Seer, the witness.

130
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:37,600
Your Spirit is the witness

131
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,080
and when you become the Spirit, you become the witness.

132
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:46,440
You become the witness. For example,

133
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:50,560
you are seeing something through a window.

134
00:08:50,999 --> 00:08:54,160
There is something exists in the window for example.

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:09:00,480
Now you enter inside the room and you see through the window.

136
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:06,400
Your conditioning is like one way arising in you as a thought,

137
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,240
which comes from the past.

138
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,400
It rises again and another thought comes up and goes in the past.

139
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,999
First the past thought is there and

140
00:09:16,999 --> 00:09:19,920
then another future thought is there it disappears.

141
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:23,800
You see the thought rising but you can't see a disappearing of the thought.

142
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:26,000
In between that is the present.

143
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:29,520
That's the place is established, that present

144
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,999
is established when your attention becomes enlightened by the Spirit.

145
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:38,360
Either you think of the future or of the past.

146
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,600
But I say now, at this moment, at the present.

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,080
You cannot stand there because your Spirit is not enlightened.

148
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,800
Because Spirit is the present.

149
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:56,920
When you get your Realization,

150
00:09:56,999 --> 00:10:00,440
you find that you are not thinking

151
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:03,240
of the future or the past, you are just enjoying.

152
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:05,600
Everything becomes different.

153
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:09,999
The whole life becomes a drama

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,680
and the joy out of it starts coming out

155
00:10:12,920 --> 00:10:16,400
and you really enjoy small, small things here and there

156
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,200
and you really understand

157
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:22,360
how much joy was lost before Realization.

158
00:10:22,999 --> 00:10:26,000
This is not a mental thing that gives you joy

159
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:29,480
but the joy pours on you from your head just like this,

160
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:32,480
cool thing starts pouring down.

161
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:36,800
As some people have a feeling of a tension rising up,

162
00:10:36,999 --> 00:10:40,760
it's the same way, a cool sort of thing,

163
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:46,560
flow of joy you feel in your whole body pours out.

164
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,999
Sometimes this cool breeze that rises in the head

165
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:54,680
also starts becoming like a fountain pouring down that joy within you.

166
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:59,120
You look at the pictures, are examples see this star of Moses.

167
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:01,600
You see, David star, you see that

168
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:05,800
when you see than you can think about it

169
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
or else just watch this.

170
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,360
Watch it and don't think.

171
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:17,040
The joy of the creation of that thing, whole thing, becomes one with you.

172
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:22,999
Like all the creation around a lake

173
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:28,440
is completely felt in the lake

174
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:30,520
if the lake has no ripples.

175
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,200
Completely. In the same way, all that is joy,

176
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:38,999
the creator, whosoever it may be has put there.

177
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:43,520
You get the complete joy within yourself because there is no thought.

178
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,440
There is no barrier. No conditioning.

179
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
The whole thing becomes one with you

180
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,640
and you start feeling extremely happy.

181
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,560
Extremely joyous.

182
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:01,120
A feeling, which is indescribable.

183
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,680
It is to be just enjoyed, to be felt. Like Kabira was asked,

184
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:10,240
"Why don't you speak now?" So he says in Hindi language,

185
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
he is one of the terrific poets we have,

186
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,160
he says, "Jab mast huye to kya huye.

187
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:24,280
When I have gone into the nectar of the intoxication

188
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,120
of the Spirit, now what can I talk.

189
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,960
There no word. No cup can fill this joy,

190
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:33,640
no words can fill this meaning.

191
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:36,999
You better be with me and get it and enjoy yourself."

192
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,999
That's all he could say.
