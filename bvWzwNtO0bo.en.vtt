00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:08.960
I am so very happy to see so many\h
Sahaja Yogis are here now in America.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:19.360
And the program we have had\h
the other day showed us clearly\h\h

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.200
that Sahaja Yoga is getting very popular\h
and the way people got their realization\h\h

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:38.720
in five minutes also showed that now we have\h
touched that area of seekers who are honest\h\h

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
and who are of a very high level in spirituality.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.560
You are the ones who are the first Sahaja\h
Yogis we should say or the foundation\h\h

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:03.040
of the Sahaja Yoga in America and thus we\h
have to understand our own responsibility.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:11.840
As it is Vishuddhi Chakra is\h
responsible for the whole world.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:24.720
But the people in Vishuddhi Chakra have to be\h
like Ganas, they have to be very responsible,\h\h

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.000
extremely, much more than any\h
other country in the whole world.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:42.080
And the problem is somehow I found, I don’t\h
know about the future, that, that sense of\h\h

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:50.720
responsibility yet not felt among Sahaja Yogis\h
that they are responsible for the whole world;\h\h

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.480
not only for America or only for\h
New York or only for Yonkers.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.240
Sitting down here you are\h
responsible for the whole world.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.240
If you understand this that the main quality\h
of Vishuddhi Chakra is responsibility,\h\h

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.640
I always say, “It’s on my shoulder.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.680
I take it on my shoulder”, meaning what?

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.480
That I take the responsibility,\h\h

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:36.000
but this sense of responsibility\h
has to come to you very clearly.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.360
I felt America is so far\h
away but if they could come\h\h

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:50.560
and see in Russia how the Russians are\h
behaving towards Sahaja Yoga they’ll be amazed.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.960
I’ve been coming to America since so many years.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.960
Perhaps we should say this is\h
the first country I visited.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:06.160
But here the sense of responsibility\h
for Sahaja Yoga has not grown.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:12.080
While in a country like Russia and Eastern\h
blocks I’ve been only four years there hardly\h\h

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.920
and you should see it how they feel responsible.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.880
Now in Russia, Sahaja Yoga\h
has spread upto Siberia.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.840
Now in Siberia they don’t live for\h
themselves only or for their Ashram.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.120
There they have got a place called Novosibirsk,\h\h

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.640
which is mostly inhabited by scientists\h
because so many scientists were thrown away\h\h

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:54.240
by Czars and later on by the communists\h
and were exiled into that place.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.560
Now these people sitting there tried\h
to find out what is spirituality?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.760
How do we get to spirituality?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.400
What is the way we can be our spiritual being?

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:18.880
No quarrel, no fights, no stupid things\h
that people do, no domination, no ego.

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:30.640
I was there only about a week back I should\h
say, more than a week and last day before going,\h\h

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.160
there came a scientist.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:44.080
His eyes really were just like\h
ocean, were absolutely beautiful\h\h

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:50.640
and he was supposed to be one of\h
the greatest scientist of Russia\h\h

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:58.800
having a very big job of his own and he\h
didn’t talk about too much to others.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:00.800
He just wanted to see me.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:08.160
When he came he just took my\h
hand and kissed it, bowed to me.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.280
I saw in his eyes ocean of spirituality, ocean.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.160
He must have been about\h
thirty-five or forty years of age.

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.000
Can’t say his age because he\h
was so much shining and bright\h\h

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.520
and he told me, “I know everything about Mother”.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.440
I said, “What do you know?”

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.400
“That you are the incarnation of\h
God on this Earth to save us”.

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.840
“How did you find out?”

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.880
He said, “I have made a machine by\h
which I can measure energy fields,\h\h

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:47.200
of course I can’t measure your energy field.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.920
But I took a small photograph of your\h
and measured the energy field and I found\h\h

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:59.520
it was seven hundred raised to power some\h
millions and then raised to power some billions”.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.200
That’s why I don’t understand his calculation.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.200
Just imagine, and he created\h\h

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:20.000
the whole idea of his proposed experiments for\h
which he had come to take permission from Me.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.720
He said, “You just touch this\h
glass Mother, just touch it”.

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.520
And he had brought a machine.

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.920
I touched the glass and machine\h
went on revolving like that.

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.880
I was myself surprised.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:38.480
He said, “Just touching the glass it’s happening”.

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:42.400
He had a machine with him,\h
a little machine he said.

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:45.280
“This is portable”, he said.

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:48.160
So I said, “What is the permission you want?”

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:50.080
He said, “I want to use your photograph\h\h

00:06:52.080 --> 00:07:00.720
on a Satellite and from the Satellite I want to\h
project your photograph through electromagnetic\h\h

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:10.240
force and wherever in the Global region it\h
will be put, you will see it will change.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:16.400
It will change people, it will change all flora,\h
fauna and also ecological problems will be solved.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.720
Will you give me permission for that”.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.840
I said, “Of course why not?”

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:28.880
The level of scientist in that country\h
is so great, here I don’t think we can\h\h

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:34.320
get hold of any scientist because their\h
ego is keeping them hanging in the air.

00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:44.240
The another thing, which I was surprised,\h
that in Novosibirsk, where a Yogi told them\h\h

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:49.840
that Mother has told us that in our brain\h
there are ‘peethas’ of these charkas.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:58.400
They were so much surprised they said, “We\h
can verify, we have machines to verify”.

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.720
So they called Dr.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:03.120
Khan and when Dr.

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:08.160
Khan went there, he was\h
amazed, they had a machine.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:15.600
So he said, “Now let us put\h
attention to Shri Mataji”.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.280
The whole brain became reddish.

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:23.680
Then “Let us put attention to\h
heart”; here it became a red spot.

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:26.800
Then to Mooladhara, was here.

00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.680
Then to Nabhi, on both the\h
places; then to Vishuddhi.

00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.520
It was proved.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:35.280
What I have said they have proved it.

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:42.960
And so many Americans are trying\h
to get them to this country.

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:45.200
They say, “We don’t want to come.

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:50.000
We don’t want to do any more Science, we\h
want to do Meta-science, spirituality”.

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:55.040
There are two hundred and fifty scientists\h
in Novosibirsk where I could not go\h\h

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:57.680
because we had a puja.

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:07.840
Now see the difference, here I come\h
there’s quarrels between husband – wife;\h\h

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:10.640
then it’s a father – mother.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:15.360
All such petty nonsensical things are going on.

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:28.000
So your own brothers and sisters in\h
another country are doing so much of\h\h

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:36.000
experimentation, spreading of Sahaja Yoga.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.680
Imagine how will I go to Siberia, out of question.

00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:44.960
But from Siberia I don’t\h
know how many thousands came.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.120
They are all well-educated, very well\h
equipped, extremely well behaved.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:02.080
In their style, in their behavior you see that\h\h

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:08.680
there is such a lot of\h
spirituality already built in.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:18.640
When I went to Ukraine; Ukraine is a place where\h
they had this, you know, Chernobyl problem.

00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:23.360
First time when I had gone there were\h
people, who had come to my program.

00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:28.480
They had their fingers joint like this,\h
noses turned like this, all kinds of things.

00:10:30.080 --> 00:10:32.800
And the legs and feet were in a very funny way.

00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:38.160
With all that, they came to the program\h\h

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.040
and this time that hall was so full there were\h
at least ten times more people than we are here,\h\h

00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:52.400
maybe more and outside were standing, they\h
couldn’t get in, they are sitting in the passages.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:56.640
They were three tier, on\h
the ground and three more.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:05.760
Everything filled to a inch and I\h
was amazed at their spirituality.

00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.120
Everyone got realization in five minutes.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.440
What a level of people, what a level.

00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:18.880
But then I found out that in Ukraine\h\h

00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:24.960
they already had the knowledge of\h
Kundalini and of the Primordial Mother.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:31.280
They call Her ‘Aditi’, in India also we call Her\h
‘Aditi’ and they used to make paintings of her.

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:39.760
Then they had paintings made of Agnya\h
Chakra, of Mooladhara, very clear.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:45.800
In those days before Christ, three\h
thousand years before Christ.

00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:56.840
So basically in them from where,\h
somewhere, this knowledge had come.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:02.000
You are very advanced people here, supposed to.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:11.840
You are very well equipped and people\h
think Americans are the top for everything.

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.800
But look at these people\h
from Ukraine and from Russia.

00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.080
They were worshiping the Primordial Mother\h\h

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.240
three thousand before Christ and when\h
Christianity came, they suppressed it.

00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:30.240
All clearly written down\h\h

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:38.000
and when people wrote about it also, these\h\h

00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:45.520
Christians there, they were called as orthodox\h
Christian, they tried to kill them, arrest them.

00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.480
Despite all those\h\h

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:58.400
problems they stuck on and I was surprised that\h
even today there are books and magazines about it.

00:13:04.560 --> 00:13:09.920
So I was thinking somebody like Macchindranath\h
who went all over the world, must have gone\h\h

00:13:09.920 --> 00:13:15.840
with his disciples Gorakhnath, because they were\h
Nath Panthis, they knew about Kundalini and all.

00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:24.382
But actually they have shown the ‘Aditi’,\h
the Mother with the Kundalini in a stomach.

00:13:24.382 --> 00:13:27.360
Can you imagine?

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:34.160
All these things were done long\h
time back and that’s why basically\h\h

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.000
they are very spiritual people.

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:48.640
Firstly they are very introspective and very\h
spiritual and all the time they are asking “Mother\h\h

00:13:49.920 --> 00:13:51.360
are we going to be all right?

00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.360
Are we all right?

00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.840
Have we really taken our ascent?” Like that\h\h

00:13:57.840 --> 00:14:02.880
those questions, which were absolutely\h
different from what you see in the West.

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:12.880
In whatever field they are; if he is\h
a doctor he’ll try to find something.

00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.080
A dentist, they’ll try to find\h
something, related to Sahaja Yoga\h\h

00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:22.320
and they say, “There are so many\h
coincidences that you cannot explain.

00:14:23.840 --> 00:14:28.800
How this has worked out, how?” So I said,\h
“What did you do?” He said, “We just desire\h\h

00:14:29.600 --> 00:14:32.480
that we should now try to propagate Sahaja Yoga\h\h

00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:43.360
and to analyze it and put, put it on such\h
a concrete way that nobody can doubt it.

00:14:43.360 --> 00:14:44.640
No Scientist can doubt it”.

00:14:46.480 --> 00:14:50.960
So we are at that level to\h
see somebody so much higher\h\h

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:58.720
and then we have also understanding\h
how we can rise upto that point?

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:01.840
How we have to work it out?

00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:11.840
Now the pettiness with which we suffer can come\h
in many categories but is nothing but stupidity.

00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.840
One of them is that, this idea of leadership;\h\h

00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:23.360
which is greatest stupidity\h
you could ever think of.

00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:27.680
I am just befooling you by\h
saying “You are a leader.

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:28.400
You are a leader”.

00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:35.600
Nothing it’s just a myth,\h
you don’t believe me in that.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:40.880
If I call you the leader, you must\h
know that Mother is trying to test you\h\h

00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:51.360
and others also those who are trying this power\h
game of becoming leaders, nothing at the back.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:58.080
There is no one who you can really say is\h
the leader of Sahaja Yoga except that I\h\h

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:02.160
had to have some people to\h
communicate so we call them leaders.

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:05.280
It doesn’t mean that if they become leaders,\h\h

00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:16.800
they go to heaven; they will get a right\h
royal reception, nothing like that.

00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:19.760
All will be going in the same manner.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:23.760
See this is all created by Maya.

00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:36.160
Now people are striving to become\h
leader, and I really feel like laughing.

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:42.880
Those who will try are climbing\h
a mountain, which doesn’t exist.

00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:48.080
Where are you climbing?

00:16:48.640 --> 00:16:50.320
Where are you going?

00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.440
It doesn’t exist.

00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:53.440
There’s no mountain, it’s\h
all straightforward road.

00:16:57.840 --> 00:17:01.280
So this is also a sign of complete stupidity.

00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.240
Are we to say that all the\h
stupids are born in this country?

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:15.680
Are we to feel that all stupidity has trickled\h
down to this country through Hudson River?

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:23.840
Are we to believe that all\h
intelligence has vanished into ego?

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.160
Once you realize it is stupidity, it’s best to\h
stand before the mirror and make fun of yourself.

00:17:36.240 --> 00:17:42.000
Also I’ve noticed with all the writers of\h
Russia, they’ve been very introspective.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.040
Even a hero will think ten times\h
“Why I am loving this lady?

00:17:47.040 --> 00:17:52.400
Why I am doing this?” Even the woman if she’s\h
in love she’ll think, “Why am I doing that?

00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:54.160
Should I do it or not?

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.280
It’s proper or not?

00:17:56.400 --> 00:17:59.840
Is it something in my head that\h
is making me do it?” You see,\h\h

00:17:59.840 --> 00:18:04.160
absolutely clearly they go\h
on introspecting themselves.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.640
Even now I find the Russians are like that.

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:10.640
So we have to now start a new tradition.

00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:14.320
In that tradition, we have to introspect.

00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:18.720
Introspect yourself.

00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:32.320
This another way is you shouldn’t\h
try to see the defects of others\h\h

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:34.000
but to see what’s wrong with you?

00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:37.760
Where do you fail?

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:39.600
Why do you fail?

00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.240
Why you cannot propagate Sahaja Yoga?

00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:45.120
What is the reason to it?

00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:46.080
What has failed you?

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:57.840
Because it’s only possible when you think you\h
are responsible, not leader but responsible.

00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:04.080
This is the country where we’ve\h
had greatest fights for leadership\h\h

00:19:04.720 --> 00:19:09.920
and all leaders have now jumped into river Hudson.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:12.640
So this kind of stupid ideas should be given up\h\h

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:16.320
and we should introspect to\h
see how much stupid we are.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:29.040
I had started believing that the special blessing\h
of Maya is on Americans that they are all stupid.

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:34.800
I used to really, I used to think,\h
I must confess, in a beginning.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:39.840
Then I met you all and I\h
realized it’s not that bad.

00:19:51.760 --> 00:19:54.320
Because I met so many important people,\h\h

00:19:55.360 --> 00:19:58.480
Ambassadors, this and that\h
and all that, in England.

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.280
I used to wonder what’s wrong with them.

00:20:03.280 --> 00:20:08.240
They used to behave like young\h
boys of twenty years you see.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:12.400
In Hindi we call it ‘gadha pachchsi’,\h
means at twenty-five you are a donkey.

00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:20.080
And the way they used to pass jokes\h
and I say they have no dignity,\h\h

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:24.480
nothing; such high positions they\h
are having what do they talk about?

00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.600
And they would stand out by that you know?

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.280
They said, “Ah we’re very smart” you know?

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.280
They would wink at everyone, they\h
would do all kinds of nonsensical\h\h

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:38.080
thing which normally a twenty year\h
boy might do anywhere once in a while.

00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:39.920
But they were all like that.

00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.440
They thought they were very young\h
and they would walk you see with very\h\h

00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:48.400
great smartness you see like young boys.

00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:58.160
To them it should be very fast and like you see a\h
bowler is about to bowl or some sort of a thing.

00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:06.720
It was really unbelievable that these people\h
occupy such high position in the government.

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:08.560
How could they be so irresponsible?

00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:16.640
But when I met you all then I really felt\h
that no no there are many good people also.

00:21:19.280 --> 00:21:25.520
This comparison you can today also\h
see between you and these people.

00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:29.840
They’ll argue for anything.

00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:33.440
They’ll talk about anything like\h
for Freud they were fighting.

00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.680
Freud’s told us something very new.

00:21:39.280 --> 00:21:41.680
So I’ve written in my book, so I said, “All right\h\h

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.040
you have eaten all kinds of food before\h
but you have not eaten the table.

00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:48.320
What about eating the table?”\h\h

00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:57.840
So everything absurd, everything vulgar,\h
everything low level were justified.

00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:00.000
I don’t blame him.

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.160
All these stupid people were\h
born here and they wrote books.

00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.640
They were the ones who were Generals.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.600
They were in-charge.

00:22:17.600 --> 00:22:18.880
I mean I can’t understand.

00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:26.000
You see this fellow Nought.

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.280
You can one minute you look at him\h
and you will know he’s a lunatic\h\h

00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:36.880
and they gave him so much time so much\h
explanation; I mean I can’t understand.

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:47.120
And the idea about spirituality is like\h
somebody comes and tells you something absurd.

00:22:47.120 --> 00:22:51.760
It’s new, it’s new, so do it.

00:22:51.760 --> 00:22:55.590
Now they say that you shave your head;\h
all right, they shave their head.

00:22:55.590 --> 00:22:58.640
They’ll say no “you grow\h
your hair” and they’ll grow.

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.000
As if they have no personality of their own.

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.840
They don’t think much about themselves.

00:23:05.840 --> 00:23:07.840
They have no respect of themselves.

00:23:08.960 --> 00:23:14.000
Even in those parties they used to tell me\h
“Ah have you been to this Guru?” I said,\h\h

00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:18.240
“No I am sorry, I’ve not”\h
Nowadays its bargain better do it.

00:23:20.000 --> 00:23:26.240
Level of understanding of spirituality was also\h
so low of these people who were so highly placed\h\h

00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:35.840
and I was really I was amazed how could\h
they do such things with such big position.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.480
There was one fellow who was quite highly placed\h\h

00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:43.520
he used to always look out for\h
me, whenever there was a party.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.280
So C.P.

00:23:45.280 --> 00:23:50.240
said, “Why does he look out for you?”\h
I said you know he wants to eat a lot\h\h

00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:55.120
and here the food they serve in\h
England is not sufficient for him.

00:23:55.840 --> 00:23:59.280
So he sit next to me so he\h
can share all my food you see.

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:00.400
That’s why he always there.

00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:02.000
I eat very little.

00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.040
So, so much interest in food.

00:24:06.480 --> 00:24:09.440
Then when I was not there he\h
would go and sit with C.P.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:11.840
because He knew the secret He\h
used to pass His food to him.

00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:20.160
So much interest in food and himself was in a such\h
a big position and what was he boasting about?

00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.400
That I come on a bicycle on a half pant to office.

00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:28.400
So I said, “Why do you go on a half pant?”

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.320
“It’s better, for a bicycle”

00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.840
“Why do you come in a bicycle?”

00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:33.280
“It better for health”

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.400
“But after all you are such a big officer.

00:24:37.120 --> 00:24:40.240
If you are going to your office\h
you should go on a motorcar.

00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:46.320
You have such a big car and then this bicycle\h
you can do it in some sports club or something”.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.080
Out of proportion, where are you going?

00:24:50.080 --> 00:24:51.360
What work you have to do?

00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:52.400
Why don’t you understand?

00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:57.760
And he’s the one who used to\h
eat like a glutton I tell you.

00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:59.920
He was thin like this.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.280
Absolutely thin like this.

00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.160
So I concluded must be worms in\h
his stomach or whatever it is.

00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:09.920
I used have pity for him\h
because always very hungry.

00:25:11.360 --> 00:25:20.160
Now, the attention if it is on food,\h
attention if it is on money, attention\h\h

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:32.240
if it is on so called power of leadership and\h
all that know that it will make you stupid.

00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:36.560
Anybody who boasts, “I am the leader of this”.

00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:40.560
All right, all right, very good!\h
You’ve known one like him you see?

00:25:41.280 --> 00:25:44.000
That what you have to react because\h\h

00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:50.160
if you say that I am the leader of this and\h
this, itself shows that you are a stupid fool,\h\h

00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:55.840
isn’t it?

00:25:57.520 --> 00:26:02.640
Because if you know it’s stupidity, all\h
this Mother is making a fool out of us,\h\h

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:12.880
why should you say, “I am the greatest fool?”\h
Why should you yourself boast of yourself?

00:26:14.560 --> 00:26:17.920
Even any boasting is a sign\h
of a stupid fool you know?

00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.320
Or a mad lunatic person.

00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.600
Once our Prime Minister went to one lunatic\h
asylum and he met one who was sane to talk to.

00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:30.720
So he asked him, “Who are you?”

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:32.720
He said, “I am Jawaharlal Nehru”

00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:34.560
He said, “Who is Jawaharlal Nehru?”

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:40.800
He said, “I am the one who was the,\h
who is the Prime Minister of India”

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:43.680
“Aahh! You’ll be all right.

00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:45.280
I used to say the same.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:56.080
You stay here for five-six\h
months you’ll be all right”.

00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:59.440
So all such bombastic talking those people who do,\h\h

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:06.720
you should just know I am telling you\h
certified lunatics or certified fools.

00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:22.840
And once this goes, this stupidity into your\h
head you will be no more a Sahaja Yogi, no more.

00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:30.640
Whole spirituality will come out\h
and you’ll be left high and dry.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:34.160
Anyone who boasts like that\h\h

00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:42.720
is worse but even if you think like\h
that is no good, not on a proper lines.

00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:50.720
So because of this ego you don’t\h
understand your responsibility.

00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:58.480
When you argue also I’ve seen people “But\h
I am the leader of this, I am the leader”.

00:27:59.200 --> 00:28:02.960
I start looking at them\h
how can they live together.

00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.360
How can they be collective, which\h
is the quality of Vishuddhi Chakra?

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:11.440
I just saw these trees, see how many they are?

00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:13.760
Of different varieties, different qualities,\h\h

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:19.120
of different nature; absolutely\h
different, how they are living together?

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:24.160
They all share the same\h
sunlight, they don’t quarrel.

00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:30.320
The tree doesn’t say, “I must fall onto another\h
one somehow because he thinks …..[UNCLEAR]”.

00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:33.360
One thing is I cannot tell this\h
trees that you are the leader.

00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.880
Only I can befool human beings.

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:41.600
This is the main thing is – please be careful.

00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:47.440
Don’t be befooled by what I tell you, All right.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.600
As far as, because if I see somebody stupid I do\h\h

00:28:54.160 --> 00:29:03.680
pamper his ego so that it bursts forever\h
and he gets rid of his nonsensical ego.

00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.760
But that’s not my job; point is\h
that I want you to be like Russians.

00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:12.960
They don’t have any ego, nothing.

00:29:15.840 --> 00:29:17.040
They don’t have any problem.

00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:25.840
It’s so easy to deal with them because they\h
know what I am and they know what they are.

00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.080
You cannot befool them, no.

00:29:31.840 --> 00:29:39.280
Anyone, anyone whether he is the\h
biggest scientist or the highest\h\h

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:46.880
ranking official or the highest personality,\h
in any field, you cannot befool.

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.240
They are so humble.

00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:54.640
And the Chinese, the same.

00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.480
You have to learn a lot from Chinese also.

00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:08.240
They are so sensitive to spirituality,\h
so beautiful they are, so humble.

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.280
You cannot tell them that you’ve\h
done something good work or anything.

00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.080
They say, “No, so much to be done still.

00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.560
It’s all right you are saying it in your\h
goodness but we know our weaknesses”.

00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:19.100
But in America everything is fixed and also\h
your ego is fixed like that or so and a\h\h

00:30:19.100 --> 00:30:29.680
slightest blow you bloat up and become so much\h
one that no trace of that drop should be there.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:33.600
I am no more an individual,\h\h

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:41.520
I am the ocean and this collectivity has\h
to grow in this country not in Russia.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:44.960
Everything is growing like a cancer you know.

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:48.400
Supposing the nose starts coming out from here\h\h

00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:52.400
and the mouth starts out coming\h
out from here what will happen?

00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.240
This country had to have this capacity.

00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:04.560
This country had to do this\h
while it’s done by Russia.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:07.680
I don’t even know their language.

00:31:09.760 --> 00:31:13.600
What you find here only the\h
false gurus are accepted\h\h

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:21.440
and in Sahaja Yoga people do not know\h
how to respect their self-realization.

00:31:24.160 --> 00:31:31.840
So busy with their ego, so\h
much impressed by themselves.

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:37.280
The whole atmosphere is such\h
a competition, perfection.

00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:45.840
It’s a big professional\h
achievement even in Sahaja Yoga.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.000
Sahaja Yoga is not a profession\h\h

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.560
because profession means individuality of a drop.

00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.920
This is a collective work, means what?

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:06.160
Sahaja Yoga is a surrender.

00:32:07.760 --> 00:32:09.920
It’s not a profession, it’s a surrender.

00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.160
You are a very intelligent people\h
but I think, little more than normal.

00:32:18.160 --> 00:32:23.840
So all of you start thinking on your\h
own sometimes and bring problem.

00:32:24.640 --> 00:32:27.840
But the difference of problem\h
of Russia and this place\h\h

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:34.160
is so much; somebody told me, “Mother you\h
must come and live here, will be good idea”.

00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:41.840
I will I don’t mind but every\h
third step if you meet somebody\h\h

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:52.880
who is immoral, fifth step who is a stupid fool\h
and the seventh foot/ feet you find a person\h\h

00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:58.400
who is about to give you a big lecture\h
on spirituality, so what to do?

00:33:01.840 --> 00:33:05.200
Now you cannot be one of them, I must assure you.

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.200
You are not one of them; but sometimes\h
the atmosphere is so much full of speed\h\h

00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:18.800
and so much full of this ego that you\h
do develop this ego business very fast.

00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:27.680
So quick you know and whenever I see that I get\h
real fright; what’s going to happen to America?

00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:34.320
It’s not your country; it’s not\h
the country of your government.

00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:45.200
It’s the country of collectivity,\h
collective personality.

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:53.120
So now the other day we had so many people who\h
got their realization in five minutes time.

00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:54.400
That means they are seekers.

00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:58.560
They are great seekers, they are\h
frustrated, they got it without any problem.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:09.520
But to make them understand Sahaja\h
Yoga, to make them absolutely,\h\h

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:19.840
can say, a ocean out of the drops, all that,\h\h

00:34:23.520 --> 00:34:26.080
which is the most important thing you have to do.

00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:31.760
You have to see that you make\h\h

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.200
Americans understand and realize what\h
is the greatness of their personality?

00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:47.120
Why are they on this Earth of\h
spirituality and of collectivity?

00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:47.840
Why?

00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:51.200
Why you were born here, for what purpose?

00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.200
You must evaluate.

00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:55.120
It’s not so.

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.600
They’ll get attached to,\h
identification is too much, they get\h\h

00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:06.000
attached to their children so much; if not, then\h
they will get attached to so called their power.

00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:13.440
Then they get attached to their\h
house, then they get attached\h\h

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:19.080
to their grounds, then to the stones;\h
I don’t know what they get attached to.

00:35:21.840 --> 00:35:29.840
You have to be that great, for that complete\h
detachment has to be brought in your life.

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.920
That is the most important thing.

00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.280
This a kind of an identity with\h
this, this, and this and this\h\h

00:35:42.240 --> 00:35:47.840
is not going to make you grow and if\h
you don’t grow, Sahaja Yoga won’t grow.

00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:51.440
It will keep a very, very low level profile.

00:35:52.960 --> 00:36:00.400
To get that high level profile you have\h
to do one thing is to surrender your ego.

00:36:01.520 --> 00:36:04.880
The greatest problem of America is ‘Mr.

00:36:04.880 --> 00:36:05.200
Ego’.

00:36:07.200 --> 00:36:11.840
This ego must be controlled.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:16.080
I will tell you it’s very simple everyday\h\h

00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:24.560
if you use the way we have to clear\h
out our ego, everyday, everyday.

00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:28.480
You can get rid of it\h\h

00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:37.040
because the whole speed, atmosphere,\h
competition; all is to pamper your ego.

00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:43.200
I have even seen some advertisement\h
talking about ego you see.

00:36:43.920 --> 00:36:47.200
“This cigarette if you smoke\h
your ego will be pampered”.

00:36:47.200 --> 00:36:48.560
Can you imagine?

00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:55.760
And people buy that kind of a nonsense,\h
because they think it’s great to know\h\h

00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:00.560
our ego will be pampered, as if\h
their ego is not already pampered.

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:10.640
So this ego business comes to people\h
because there’s no introspection.

00:37:12.800 --> 00:37:17.600
When there is no introspection\h
you see one develops this ego.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:19.200
I am something great.

00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:23.920
Now say sitting down here if you start\h
say, “I am great, I am great, I am great”.

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.360
Do you become great?

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:27.920
You cannot.

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:31.280
There’s a story about a frog you must have heard\h\h

00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.560
who was in a well and he used\h
to think no end of himself.

00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:42.240
“I am everything, I am this, I am that”.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:46.080
Somebody told him that have you seen a cow?

00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.320
He said, “What is cow?”

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:51.040
“It’s very big animal compared to you”.

00:37:51.040 --> 00:37:52.320
“I can also become big.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:59.600
Why not I will” and starts\h
growing, growing till he burst out.

00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:03.040
So this is what it is we have to understand\h\h

00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:10.720
that this ego business is the real,\h
real, real problem of America.

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:20.880
So now you have to surrender.

00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:23.760
Now surrender to whom?

00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:30.080
It’s like this that if you say you are\h
seekers, I mean you are seekers of everything.

00:38:31.120 --> 00:38:37.200
You are seekers of money, seekers of\h
power, seekers of this, seekers of that.

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:45.840
But if you are seekers of truth then\h
just face yourself and know yourself\h\h

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:56.800
and know the truth that you\h
cannot be, you cannot be a person\h\h

00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:07.160
of any value if you have this artificial\h
ego on your head like a big balloon, never.

00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:18.800
This ego has to be brought down absolutely\h
and all of you should try to bring it down\h\h

00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:32.880
by doing some sort of a special\h
method of searching within yourself.

00:39:32.880 --> 00:39:33.520
You have to,\h\h

00:39:37.520 --> 00:39:41.760
I don’t know how to detach\h
yourself and see for yourself is\h\h

00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:46.560
rather a difficult thing\h
because ego is very satisfied.

00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:50.320
This is the biggest problem.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:57.120
Ego gives great satisfaction and\h
with that ego you see you react\h\h

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.880
and reaction has become like\h
a sort of a might or a fright.

00:40:07.200 --> 00:40:12.240
React; “I don’t like it, I don’t like\h
that, I don’t like that” Who are you?

00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:16.320
If somebody say, “I don’t like you”, finished.

00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:24.800
First of all you should\h
say, “I don’t like myself”.

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:25.760
Let’s start like that.

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:27.120
Why?

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:31.600
Because all my life is centered\h
round this, I am doing this,\h\h

00:40:31.600 --> 00:40:35.200
I am doing that stupidity, another\h
stupidity; how can I like myself?

00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.840
I am the Spirit.

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:44.480
Then you will start growing because\h
this conditioning keeps you down.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:53.760
But somebody asked me, “Who is interested\h
in growing Mother?” I said, “Why?

00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:57.680
They’re not?” They are not Sahaja Yogis, finished.

00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:04.400
So there’s going to be a great ship\h
coming down to take all the Sahaja Yogis\h\h

00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:07.520
to enter into the kingdom of God.

00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:12.240
So why, why should we introspect?

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.120
You have to grow.

00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:23.200
Even the stage is not there that is confirmed\h
that you’ll enter into the kingdom of God.

00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:31.280
You have to give up this stupid idea of ego.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.720
But what should replace it?

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:38.000
What will replace it?

00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:47.840
Is love and compassion.

00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:54.160
That two people can use it with the ego like I\h
tell somebody now this fellow is not all right.

00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:57.840
“But Mother you know he is, I love him”.

00:42:00.080 --> 00:42:02.840
If you love him better correct it.

00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:08.320
If you really love, have courage to\h
tell him that this is wrong with you.

00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:15.840
If you are continuing with this love\h
story, then you must correct that person.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:24.240
And all these complicated you know such\h
complicated things there are with this ego\h\h

00:42:25.520 --> 00:42:30.560
that you just don’t know how to solve the problem\h
sometimes if somebody comes to you with that ego.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:37.440
So first is to introspect and\h
find out why am I egoistical?

00:42:37.440 --> 00:42:43.840
What have I done?

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:51.360
You’ll surprised, I don’t know what is ego is.

00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:54.800
I really, I’ve just seen some things,\h\h

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.080
but to be very frank I don’t\h
know what people are egoistic of.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.080
Like sometimes you start saying My ‘Jai’.

00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.720
I also says ‘Jai’.

00:43:04.560 --> 00:43:06.320
I don’t think it’s me you are saying ‘Jai’.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:09.480
Just say – all right they are\h
saying Jai, like that I say Jai,\h\h

00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:14.640
because I don’t know why you say Jai.

00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.440
I don’t know why?

00:43:16.080 --> 00:43:16.800
What have I done?

00:43:17.880 --> 00:43:20.800
Why are you praising me I just don’t understand?

00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:26.160
If somebody says “Thank you very much Mother”.

00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:28.800
I don’t understand why they are thanking for what?

00:43:30.080 --> 00:43:30.880
What have I done?

00:43:32.720 --> 00:43:41.120
See this ego is the one that records\h
everything that this is what it is.

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:44.560
I am such and I am such and\h
I am such, all falsehood.

00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.360
But if you don’t have such a record\h
in your head you cannot feel ego.

00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:58.960
If somebody says, “You are very good\h
looking”, immediately the balloon starts.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.360
Why is he saying?

00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:08.240
May be he wants some money, maybe he wants to use\h
you for some purpose, may be he’s praising because\h\h

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:10.160
he knows you are a stupid fool.

00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:21.920
So why accept such a remark\h
as something great you know.

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:25.760
And in this way we lose ourselves completely.

00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.040
Let us have a command of ourselves.

00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:30.000
Do we know ourselves?

00:44:31.360 --> 00:44:37.440
I know I am that, I know I am born like that,\h
I know all these things are there, so what?

00:44:39.920 --> 00:44:42.960
I mean I didn’t achieve\h
anything, you at least achieved.

00:44:43.520 --> 00:44:45.680
I never achieved anything; I was just like that.

00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.840
So, why to be conscious of it?

00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.760
That I am this, I am; I am nothing.

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:56.640
Because whatever I am, I am.

00:44:58.160 --> 00:45:01.200
Now supposing this wood says\h
“Oh I am wood”, so what?

00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.320
You are wood after all.

00:45:04.320 --> 00:45:08.880
As simple as that, as simple as that.

00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:14.480
So, see this complications of\h
your mind should be reduced\h\h

00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.200
otherwise your attention will never improve\h
and what will happen is that you’ll not grow.

00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:21.840
And the dwarfs, you know?

00:45:23.120 --> 00:45:24.720
We’ll have all the dwarfs here.

00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:32.160
I want to show to Russians that\h
you are quite capable of growing\h\h

00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:39.760
and you are quite capable of\h
looking after your country.

00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:45.840
Your own President, his wife\h
all of them are funny people.

00:45:46.720 --> 00:45:51.440
Try to talk nonsense sometimes,\h
absolute, can’t understand.

00:45:52.640 --> 00:45:59.920
What business they have got to talk about other\h
countries when their own country is suffering so?

00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:05.200
There’s no introspection, there’s no understanding\h
what’s wrong with your own country and you start\h\h

00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:08.560
talking about other countries ‘this is\h
wrong with them that is wrong with them’.

00:46:11.760 --> 00:46:18.960
So in this atmosphere where you find a whole\h
lot of people have this problem of ego,\h\h

00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:24.320
you can only supercede them, only shine out,\h\h

00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:31.320
you can only save them by absolutely getting\h
rid of your ego, absolutely, hundred percent;\h\h

00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:35.920
in every way.

00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:40.160
You’ll see you’ll feel much lighter.

00:46:41.520 --> 00:46:44.880
Imagine you are hanging in the air, you\h
don’t know where you are going to land?

00:46:45.840 --> 00:46:46.880
How can you feel secured?

00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.560
As they say ‘stand on your legs’.

00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.640
It’s like that; stand on your leg.

00:47:01.360 --> 00:47:07.760
So now Sahaja Yoga is progressing very well,\h
very fast everywhere in the whole world.

00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.760
They gave Me a Doctorate, they did this,\h\h

00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:16.000
they are trying their level best\h
now to give Me a Nobel Prize also.

00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:20.240
Because only the Nobel Prize can put\h
these egoistical people all right.

00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.960
So they are working very\h
hard to get Me a Nobel Prize.

00:47:26.720 --> 00:47:31.360
All that is to show that people\h
will never accept me unless and\h\h

00:47:31.360 --> 00:47:33.680
until I have some sort of a brand on my head.

00:47:36.640 --> 00:47:43.600
But is important, in this world one\h
has to have some sort of a brand if he\h\h

00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.200
have to survive, everything.

00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:53.600
So, for you also it is important that you\h
have to have the brand of Sahaja Yogi.

00:47:55.200 --> 00:47:58.800
But in Sahaja Yoga if you have\h
the brand doesn’t work out.

00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:05.840
You have to have in reality\h
that power of Yoga within you.

00:48:07.120 --> 00:48:12.560
You can do a lot I know because you stand\h
on land of Shri Krishna and His power.

00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:20.320
Don’t need anything else, need;\h
don’t need any machinery, nothing.

00:48:20.320 --> 00:48:26.640
But only realize your responsibility, what\h
we are doing for Sahaja Yoga, for our self?

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:27.680
How are we behaving?

00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:29.840
What is our style?

00:48:31.120 --> 00:48:33.920
How are we spreading Sahaja Yoga?

00:48:33.920 --> 00:48:34.560
Please try.

00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:39.120
If you can really introspect you’ll find\h\h

00:48:39.120 --> 00:48:44.960
that you’ll feel that we haven’t done much\h
for Sahaja Yoga that we could’ve done.

00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:50.160
Busy with yourself, with your own activities.

00:48:51.200 --> 00:48:54.080
But unless and until you do\h
for Sahaja Yoga something\h\h

00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:02.000
you have no meaning at all, you have no identity.

00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:09.840
If you can develop this beautiful\h
reflective nature by which you just\h\h

00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:17.120
reflect about yourself and not about others,\h
you’ll be amazed, how much will change.

00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.800
Even a simple meditation people don’t do.

00:49:21.680 --> 00:49:23.600
You get them an Ashram; there they fight.

00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:29.840
Do what you like ends up into something funny.

00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:36.640
I didn’t want to talk to you about\h
something unpleasant all the time.

00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:37.840
It’s not a very good idea.

00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:47.360
But I feel that you should now awaken to the\h
fact what is your responsibility as Americans?

00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:53.920
Very important, extremely important.

00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:02.480
And once you realize that you can do so\h
many things because you have got the Power.

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:04.480
You have the Divine Power.

00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:12.560
But you must awaken and shed off this horrible\h
thing called ego, which makes you a monkey.

00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:19.680
I’ve seen this is the only problem you have.

00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:21.040
There’s not much conditioning.

00:50:21.920 --> 00:50:23.680
But this ego is the only problem.

00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:26.800
You don’t respect anyone, you\h
don’t respect this Motherland,\h\h

00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.600
you don’t respect even your self-realization.

00:50:31.040 --> 00:50:35.680
So this point today we have to know that we are,\h\h

00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:38.720
we cannot afford to have this\h
ego anymore on our heads.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:41.440
We just are not going to have it.

00:50:42.880 --> 00:50:49.600
We are going to humble down and we are going\h
to seek to things through our humility.

00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:59.600
Once you see these things work out\h
you’ll be the most important persons\h\h

00:51:01.760 --> 00:51:04.480
for even the Divine to deliver the goods.

00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:07.840
May God bless you.

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:13.760
As it is we have now, I am awaiting\h
lots of Americans will become\h\h

00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:22.720
and what will convince them of you is\h
your humility and your good manners;\h\h

00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.440
very important.

00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:34.240
If these two things they\h
see in you they will change.

00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.480
I am sure they will change.

00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.360
Not to be aggressive with them.
