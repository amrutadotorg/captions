00:00:00.595 --> 00:00:01.925
Who is going to find out?

00:00:03.295 --> 00:00:05.435
[UNCLEAR]

00:00:05.965 --> 00:00:09.065
Australia or to say your

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:10.475
country

00:00:11.285 --> 00:00:13.375
which is very good at

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:15.185
getting all the black money.

00:00:18.315 --> 00:00:19.315
to Switzerland.

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.975
[UNCLEAR] stupid things are done.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:25.820
 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.920
What is the need to allow the money to

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.360
go out of [UNCLEAR] I don't understand

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:33.755
cash money, you see

00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:35.895
 

00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:38.775
that only has black market.

00:00:45.505 --> 00:00:46.505
 

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:51.185
[UNCLEAR] maybe taxation binds

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:52.935
military things.

00:00:54.115 --> 00:00:55.415
You tax someone

00:00:56.135 --> 00:00:59.055
all right, you tax for something sensible, nobody minds

00:00:59.055 --> 00:01:01.925
but for buying military things and then seeking [UNCLEAR]

00:01:02.995 --> 00:01:04.575
What's the use?

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.320
While your hard-earned money

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.240
the tax payer is going in the

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.660
see of [UNCLEAR]

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:18.900
[UNCLEAR] Where are you two going?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.120
She is buying all these materials,

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.620
more materials, [UNCLEAR] finished.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.820
Then, its also, you see, a double solver

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.880
also these horrible Argentinians

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.340
people who killed their own people

00:01:38.465 --> 00:01:39.815
are being punished now.

00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.245
All these dictators are [UNCLEAR] punished.

00:01:50.245 --> 00:01:51.505
That's a very good thing.

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:55.175
They needed some punishment.

00:01:56.465 --> 00:01:59.765
Why is she the person who is harmed because she was collecting

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.040
She started this, and another is America.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.220
[UNCLEAR] be in trouble. [I will see that UNCLEAR]

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.220
very soon.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.760
 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:19.140
 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.220
Russia is in trouble too.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.520
It will work out, you will see that.

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.100
You don't realize how [UNCLEAR]

00:02:38.295 --> 00:02:39.295
 

00:02:40.335 --> 00:02:41.335
 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.920
 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.480
She [UNCLEAR] for ten people [UNCLEAR]

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.420
finished.

00:02:57.555 --> 00:03:00.705
 

00:03:00.705 --> 00:03:02.285
I will get you small plates for biscuits and cheese Mother.

00:03:02.845 --> 00:03:06.185
 

00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.165
 

00:03:09.825 --> 00:03:11.205
 

00:03:12.815 --> 00:03:13.815
 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.980
 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.960
May I keep this as prasad?

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.420
 

00:03:31.995 --> 00:03:33.525
 

00:03:37.915 --> 00:03:38.915
 

00:03:47.755 --> 00:03:48.755
 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:57.860
 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.080
I think now there will be a revolution.

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.680
in Argentina and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.100
[Chile ? UNCLEAR]

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.300
In Argentina and

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.480
Chile.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.320
[UNCLEAR]

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.420
Did you follow?

00:04:26.155 --> 00:04:29.595
She just doesn't follow. What's the matter?

00:04:30.005 --> 00:04:31.005
 

00:04:31.365 --> 00:04:34.285
I said there will be a revolution now.

00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:37.915
I don't know. [UNCLEAR]

00:04:37.915 --> 00:04:40.015
[UNCLEAR]

00:04:40.605 --> 00:04:42.585
It's too good.

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:45.905
You see

00:04:50.905 --> 00:04:51.905
 

00:04:55.625 --> 00:04:58.835
But no communism. You see the trouble was

00:04:59.445 --> 00:05:01.685
these people were going to communism.

00:05:03.235 --> 00:05:06.355
If they had gone for democracy, [UNCLEAR]

00:05:07.055 --> 00:05:09.705
Because communism is no solution at all.

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.040
It's much worse than dictatorship.

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.900
[UNCLEAR]

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.520
Yogi: The communist not believe in God. Mataji: Not at all.

00:05:21.675 --> 00:05:24.215
[UNCLEAR] What's the use of having communism?

00:05:24.655 --> 00:05:25.655
 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.620
 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.020
Yogi: They are very materialistic even.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:33.220
Mataji: Very materialistic.

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.980
And this was the mistake of Chile people and Argentina people to ask for communism.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.880
 

00:05:43.195 --> 00:05:45.145
Communist wouldn't even know what has happened.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.160
Nice to see communism from far.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.420
How communism?

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.120
That was a mistake.

00:06:19.095 --> 00:06:21.115
Chile people are slo stupid.

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.400
They don't understand what communism is.

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.980
Russia will just come and sit on their head.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.880
Whatever happened to Poland see.

00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.400
Czechoslovakia finished, Poland finished.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:35.480
It could finish too.

00:06:38.285 --> 00:06:41.155
Afghanistan tried to [UNCLEAR] something.

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.160
They are sitting on their heads now.

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:44.640
 

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.380
Only the Indians are saved.

00:06:57.445 --> 00:07:00.565
Yogi: Now the church.

00:07:00.565 --> 00:07:03.855
Yogi: The Church in Chile, they are very political Mother.

00:07:05.445 --> 00:07:07.885
Mataji: Church? Yogi:Yes.

00:07:07.885 --> 00:07:09.660
[UNCLEAR] What about your Pope?

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:12.480
[UNCLEAR] a political stunt.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.095
He said,"I don't want any war."

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.180
I mean, who wants war?

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:24.220
What is the need to say, "I don't want any war"? But give some solution.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:27.020
What is the solution?

00:07:28.085 --> 00:07:31.155
I don't want to be involved, everything is to be done peacefully.

00:07:32.005 --> 00:07:34.295
For that you don't need a Pope to say that.

00:07:36.475 --> 00:07:37.475
 

00:07:49.925 --> 00:07:52.735
Church is for teaching them Capitalism.

00:07:54.325 --> 00:07:55.325
 

00:07:57.835 --> 00:08:00.705
Yogi: Catholic ..

00:08:00.705 --> 00:08:03.660
How they? from the left people..

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.840
 

00:08:06.845 --> 00:08:09.720
Yogi: Communist people Mother.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.060
They [help?] the Communist.

00:08:11.540 --> 00:08:13.500
The communist people they [killed?]

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.800
They killed this and they killed this, that's all.

00:08:20.060 --> 00:08:21.560
So, they are just the same.

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:34.180
What was your Mother's [UNCLEAR] Communism?

00:08:34.235 --> 00:08:35.235
 

00:08:36.525 --> 00:08:37.905
That's [UNCLEAR] stupidity.

00:08:39.345 --> 00:08:42.415
[UNCLEAR believe in communism.

00:08:42.585 --> 00:08:45.495
[UNCLEAR]

00:08:45.495 --> 00:08:48.455
[UNCLEAR]

00:08:48.455 --> 00:08:49.855
 

00:08:50.495 --> 00:08:51.545
 

00:08:51.885 --> 00:08:54.285
Yogi: In 1970

00:08:54.285 --> 00:08:57.605
until 1970, I was [UNCLEAR] this [UNCLEAR]

00:08:58.475 --> 00:09:01.555
I was very active in Politics.

00:09:01.935 --> 00:09:03.185
Because my

00:09:03.655 --> 00:09:06.555
 

00:09:06.945 --> 00:09:09.235
mother [UNCLEAR]  and myself

00:09:09.235 --> 00:09:12.545
to do politics since.

00:09:13.105 --> 00:09:15.905
So [UNCLEAR]  and myself you were communist?

00:09:16.575 --> 00:09:19.955
I was [UNCLEAR]   You worked for communist that time? I was socialist.

00:09:19.955 --> 00:09:22.175
Yes communist.

00:09:22.175 --> 00:09:25.505
See, now you see the stupidity of communism is there.

00:09:25.625 --> 00:09:26.735
Complete.

00:09:28.225 --> 00:09:29.225
That was the mistake.

00:09:30.545 --> 00:09:32.305
[UNCLEAR]

00:09:33.985 --> 00:09:35.805
They don't understand God at all.

00:09:39.415 --> 00:09:40.435
They are absurd people.

00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:41.835
 

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.880
Sahajayoga would have never reached to [UNCLEAR]  were a communist.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.740
Of course, now, you have given up all your political.

00:09:53.185 --> 00:09:54.705
[UNCLEAR]

00:09:56.745 --> 00:09:57.885
He too was.

00:09:58.835 --> 00:09:59.835
 

00:10:00.345 --> 00:10:01.345
I was never

00:10:01.395 --> 00:10:04.435
very much into. Mataji: But your brothers and sisters, were [UNCLEAR]  ?

00:10:04.435 --> 00:10:06.565
He is married.

00:10:07.105 --> 00:10:10.055
Wendy is

00:10:10.060 --> 00:10:18.485
Geraldo's sister. Wendy is married with my brother, so the relation is, he is my

00:10:18.485 --> 00:10:21.300
My brother is married with Geraldo's sister.

00:10:21.305 --> 00:10:24.095
 

00:10:24.095 --> 00:10:27.065
Mataji: Rodrigo is your brother?

00:10:27.065 --> 00:10:29.125
Mataji: So Rodrigo's wife is Wendy? Yogi: Yes.

00:10:29.125 --> 00:10:32.055
[Yogis and Mataji talk about relations]

00:10:32.345 --> 00:10:33.345
 

00:10:34.680 --> 00:10:35.680
 

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:39.480
[UNCLEAR]

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.520
 

00:10:46.555 --> 00:10:47.555
 

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.060
 

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:04.085
All these things should be understood in the light of the spirit.

00:11:04.085 --> 00:11:05.080
 

00:11:07.965 --> 00:11:09.095
It's difficult to understand.

00:11:12.005 --> 00:11:14.665
 

00:11:14.665 --> 00:11:15.905
Without democracy you cannot have realization.

00:11:16.325 --> 00:11:17.325
Cannot work out.

00:11:18.015 --> 00:11:20.715
I cannot go to any country which is communist.

00:11:21.845 --> 00:11:22.845
And do sahajayoga.

00:11:23.175 --> 00:11:26.415
Nor can I go to any country where there is [UNCLEAR]  rule

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:27.960
 

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.740
So both are useless. Only democratic countries we can work out.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.635
We have thought we have done, you see,

00:11:37.635 --> 00:11:40.365
We have gone to France, Portugal, all these people are democratic.

00:11:41.755 --> 00:11:44.035
[UNCLEAR]  communism had [UNCLEAR]

00:11:47.655 --> 00:11:48.655
 

00:12:12.345 --> 00:12:13.345
 

00:12:13.795 --> 00:12:14.795
 

00:12:14.935 --> 00:12:15.935
 

00:12:16.645 --> 00:12:17.735
 

00:12:18.045 --> 00:12:19.045
 

00:12:19.815 --> 00:12:20.815
 

00:12:22.645 --> 00:12:23.645
 

00:12:23.995 --> 00:12:24.955
 

00:12:24.955 --> 00:12:25.955
 

00:12:26.285 --> 00:12:27.285
 

00:12:27.315 --> 00:12:28.315
 

00:12:32.535 --> 00:12:33.535
 

00:12:33.585 --> 00:12:34.585
 

00:12:34.845 --> 00:12:35.845
 

00:12:35.885 --> 00:12:37.845
This is what it is.

00:12:38.305 --> 00:12:40.925
Very wrong misleading

00:12:40.925 --> 00:12:43.145
things these are.

00:12:43.595 --> 00:12:44.595
 

00:12:44.875 --> 00:12:45.875
 

00:12:45.885 --> 00:12:46.885
 

00:12:47.545 --> 00:12:48.545
 

00:12:49.325 --> 00:12:50.275
 

00:12:50.275 --> 00:12:51.275
 

00:12:54.395 --> 00:12:56.435
 

00:12:58.735 --> 00:12:59.735
 

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:02.505
 

00:13:15.035 --> 00:13:16.035
 

00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800
 

00:13:27.340 --> 00:13:29.980
The car fellow was just changing everything

00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.460
he was cheating.

00:13:34.435 --> 00:13:37.705
First he said something, and he changed everything horrible people.

00:13:38.165 --> 00:13:39.165
 

00:13:39.465 --> 00:13:40.465
 

00:13:40.795 --> 00:13:43.055
They are always trying to get your money.

00:13:43.785 --> 00:13:45.445
Spanish, you see, have worse

00:13:45.885 --> 00:13:48.795

They are the worst, terrible.

00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:13.180
 

00:15:14.020 --> 00:15:15.720
It's convenient.

00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:30.720
 

00:15:40.775 --> 00:15:41.775

is such a common trouble.

00:16:27.935 --> 00:16:30.025
Mataji: Many reasons are there for that.

00:16:30.855 --> 00:16:33.485
Some of them is that, they use those pills, you see.

00:16:38.245 --> 00:16:39.245

She said it was quite a lot and

00:16:58.555 --> 00:17:01.595
if it carried on tonight, they would take her to hospital.

00:17:01.845 --> 00:17:03.435
It's an ordinary case.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.760
Nothing so extra ordinary.

00:17:08.820 --> 00:17:11.520
Is it too much or less?

00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:13.040

Did you say that? Pray to Mother?

00:17:47.465 --> 00:17:48.505
Yogi: I did say Mother.

00:17:49.695 --> 00:17:52.855

00:27:27.345 --> 00:27:28.305
 

00:27:28.305 --> 00:27:29.465
 

00:27:29.835 --> 00:27:32.805
 

00:27:32.805 --> 00:27:34.605
 

00:27:36.475 --> 00:27:37.685
 

00:27:38.865 --> 00:27:41.915
 

00:27:41.915 --> 00:27:43.085
 

00:27:44.265 --> 00:27:46.995
 

00:27:46.995 --> 00:27:48.925
 

00:27:50.165 --> 00:27:51.745
 

00:27:55.545 --> 00:27:58.055
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] is going very slow because of [UNCLEAR].

00:27:59.065 --> 00:28:01.305
[UNCLEAR] is so much fighting with her.

00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:03.240
[smoky business?]

00:28:04.100 --> 00:28:05.160
very few people are

00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.840
We have lost so many [UNCLEAR]

00:28:25.585 --> 00:28:26.585
 

00:28:39.505 --> 00:28:40.505
 

00:28:41.055 --> 00:28:42.055
 

00:28:42.755 --> 00:28:43.755
 

00:28:44.715 --> 00:28:45.985
 

00:28:46.495 --> 00:28:47.495
 

00:28:48.085 --> 00:28:49.085
 

00:28:50.305 --> 00:28:51.305
 

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:54.160
 

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.280
Mataji: I think something wrong with your Visuddhi, that's why the voice is not correct.

00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:00.760
Something wrong with it.

00:29:01.325 --> 00:29:04.335
You've got this trouble, [UNCLEAR]?

00:29:04.335 --> 00:29:06.645
Yogi: Sometime Mother.

00:29:07.355 --> 00:29:08.655
Mataji: That's the reason.

00:29:09.625 --> 00:29:13.035
Mataji: That's the reason, that's why you can't hear me

00:29:13.315 --> 00:29:14.315
and you can't [UNCLEAR]

00:29:23.855 --> 00:29:26.835
You developed lot's of trouble during that Chile problem.

00:29:26.835 --> 00:29:28.765
In Chile.

00:29:29.615 --> 00:29:30.755
Mataji: You were in jail?

00:29:31.535 --> 00:29:35.015
Yogi: No, my mother.

00:29:35.125 --> 00:29:37.845
Because it was horrible time.

00:29:38.105 --> 00:29:41.105
[UNCLEAR]

00:29:41.105 --> 00:29:42.105
 

00:29:43.860 --> 00:29:46.595
 

00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:49.860
I was so afraid Mother

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.300
because  when they talked to my mother [UNCLEAR]

00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:54.540
 

00:30:00.785 --> 00:30:03.005
Mataji: [UNCLEAR] all non sense story telling.

00:30:03.685 --> 00:30:04.855
Just not it.

00:30:06.715 --> 00:30:09.365
You see, the knowledge should be such, you should know all your powers.

00:30:09.365 --> 00:30:12.165
You should now what's all is inside you, you should know

00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:15.395
what is wrong with another person, everything

00:30:15.395 --> 00:30:18.865
that is knowledge that is shuddha vidya.

00:30:18.915 --> 00:30:21.585
Yogi: [UNCLEAR] the lalita Sahashraranama.

00:30:21.585 --> 00:30:22.585
It's very difficult book.

00:30:22.905 --> 00:30:23.905
 

00:30:23.915 --> 00:30:26.665
Mataji: Now you come to the point. Yogi: I have it.

00:30:27.085 --> 00:30:30.335
Mataji: Yes, you read Lalita? Yogi: I bought it in India, yes.

00:30:30.335 --> 00:30:32.685
Mataji: That's it, that is what all it is. All right?

00:30:33.235 --> 00:30:36.305
Now put your hand towards me and say, "Mother,

00:30:36.305 --> 00:30:39.575
Are you Lalita? Ask the question.

00:30:39.795 --> 00:30:42.685
Again. Yogi: "Mother, Are you Lalita?" Again. Yogi: "Mother, Are you Lalita?"

00:30:42.685 --> 00:30:43.685
Again. Yogi: "Mother, Are you Lalita?"

00:30:43.775 --> 00:30:45.255
All right?

00:30:53.345 --> 00:30:54.345
 

00:30:56.905 --> 00:31:00.315
If you have got Lalita Sahashranama, you don't have to do anything.

00:31:03.135 --> 00:31:06.095
[UNCLEAR] they don't know anything, do they talk? They don't talk of kundalini.

00:31:06.205 --> 00:31:09.705
They don't know anything. I mean they don't even have the knowledge.

00:31:09.915 --> 00:31:11.095
Leave alone anything.

00:31:14.075 --> 00:31:16.235
Knowledge is also not sufficient, which is not [shuddha UNCLEAR]

00:31:17.015 --> 00:31:19.115
which is not pure, shuddha vidya.

00:31:21.085 --> 00:31:22.085
Just, put your hand here,

00:31:22.465 --> 00:31:23.825
put one in Swadisthana here down below.

00:31:25.155 --> 00:31:28.125
Now, say, "Mother, are you suddha vidya?" little lower.

00:31:28.125 --> 00:31:31.185
Yogi: Mother, are you sure? Mataji: No no, this one, this hand, little lower.

00:31:31.185 --> 00:31:34.405
Now ask again, "Mother, are you suddha vidya?"

00:31:34.465 --> 00:31:36.905
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"

00:31:36.975 --> 00:31:39.395
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: Again.

00:31:39.395 --> 00:31:42.225
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: Again.

00:31:42.225 --> 00:31:44.235
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: Again.

00:31:44.555 --> 00:31:46.015
"Mother, are you suddha vidya?"
Mataji: All right.

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:53.675
Mataji: Everything you belong, all the knowledge you belong, where is

00:31:53.675 --> 00:31:56.535
Lalita Chakra? Where is Shri Chakra? What is what?

00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:58.500
everything there is. Yogi: Shri Chakra?

00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:02.100
Mataji: Everything.  Yogi: [UNCLEAR] Mataji: Yeah.

00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.580
Mataji: Yes, everything, you will know where is hamsha,

00:32:05.585 --> 00:32:08.015
where is what? Everything you will know. That is knowledge.

00:32:08.385 --> 00:32:10.355
all right? Yogi: I like to be

00:32:10.595 --> 00:32:12.685
initiated in the Shri Chakra.

00:32:13.215 --> 00:32:14.995
Mataji: Shri Chakra is already is here.

00:32:16.925 --> 00:32:17.925
All right?

00:32:17.925 --> 00:32:20.945
It's [UNCLEAR], you are already initiated. Yogi: Can I practice

00:32:20.945 --> 00:32:21.945
the bija mantra?

00:32:22.435 --> 00:32:24.055
Mataji: Bija mantra? Which one you practising?

00:32:24.865 --> 00:32:26.695
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam.

00:32:27.335 --> 00:32:28.975
Mataji: I see. Say before me.

00:32:29.340 --> 00:32:32.780
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam. Mataji: Again.

00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:36.680
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam. Mataji: Again.

00:32:36.760 --> 00:32:41.340
Yogi: Hamsha samhala bryam, ananda vairabhayam.

00:32:44.100 --> 00:32:45.100
Mataji: I am the

00:32:45.415 --> 00:32:46.415
mantra vidya.

00:32:46.465 --> 00:32:47.465
All right?

00:32:48.305 --> 00:32:49.395
[UNCLEAR]

00:32:49.735 --> 00:32:50.735
 

00:32:51.255 --> 00:32:52.395
 

00:32:53.365 --> 00:32:54.935
May God bless you.

00:32:56.205 --> 00:32:58.755
He is so good, you see, just ready to have it.

00:32:59.725 --> 00:33:00.725
Work it out.

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:01.745
[UNCLEAR]

00:33:01.745 --> 00:33:04.580
Only be careful is starting

00:33:04.585 --> 00:33:07.040
on Ekadasha, this is, Ekadasha is strong

00:33:07.045 --> 00:33:09.185
because of this [UNCLEAR]. Yogi: Thank you.

00:33:10.175 --> 00:33:13.215
Mataji: All right, sit down. You work it out, you come here, every

00:33:13.215 --> 00:33:15.005
day these boys are going to be here.

00:33:15.005 --> 00:33:17.805
These boys have come all the way from England for you.

00:33:17.805 --> 00:33:20.965
They are going to stay here in this house, you see, this is, they got this house

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:23.875
so they came and stayed, they couldn't get a house also.

00:33:24.075 --> 00:33:26.965
Now, and you establish sahaja yoga here.

00:33:27.365 --> 00:33:28.365
All right?

00:33:30.885 --> 00:33:31.975
Are you all right now?

00:33:33.235 --> 00:33:35.335
All right? So you have to go to work?

00:33:35.895 --> 00:33:36.895
 

00:33:37.325 --> 00:33:38.595
 

00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:40.740
I'll vibrate your sugar.

00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.520
You are all right now. [much better? UNCLEAR]  All right. [UNCLEAR] come.

00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:50.060
Let him come. Come. Bring my sindoor.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.860
Sit down, sit down, sit down.

00:33:58.120 --> 00:33:59.540
What is this you are wearing?

00:33:59.820 --> 00:34:02.640
What is it? Yogi: [UNCLEAR]

00:34:02.955 --> 00:34:06.285
Yogi: It's just a

00:34:06.285 --> 00:34:09.415
its a [UNCLEAR] Mother, a [UNCLEAR].

00:34:09.705 --> 00:34:12.165
Mataji: [UNCLEAR], all right?

00:34:13.185 --> 00:34:14.835
Mataji: Come forward.

00:34:15.695 --> 00:34:16.695
 

00:34:21.625 --> 00:34:22.625
 

00:34:23.160 --> 00:34:24.160
 

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:27.160
Mataji: Eyes closed.

00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:49.140
He is all right.

00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:52.885
Good, are you seeing me?

00:34:52.885 --> 00:34:55.925
Good, your eyes have improved.

00:34:55.925 --> 00:34:56.920
 

00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.780
 

00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.420
I am just putting you

00:35:01.845 --> 00:35:02.995
to protect your eye

00:35:03.415 --> 00:35:04.415
[UNCLEAR] for a while.

00:35:06.475 --> 00:35:08.985
 

00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:11.420
 

00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:31.840
 

00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.140
All right.

00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.080
Better?

00:35:38.025 --> 00:35:39.025
[UNCLEAR]

00:35:40.875 --> 00:35:42.055
 

00:35:42.485 --> 00:35:45.505
[UNCLEAR], that is the  best way.

00:35:45.505 --> 00:35:46.805
 

00:35:47.905 --> 00:35:51.235
Nirbichar samadhi, it's called Nirbichara.

00:35:52.445 --> 00:35:54.625
Better not to think.

00:35:54.625 --> 00:35:56.065
 

00:35:57.965 --> 00:35:59.505
He's got all the Ekadasha and all caught up very [UNCLEAR]

00:36:00.975 --> 00:36:01.975
 

00:37:04.175 --> 00:37:06.945
Mataji: This is the side of [Buddha UNCLEAR] These are Ekadasha.

00:37:07.265 --> 00:37:09.995
11, one of them is Mahavira.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.480
[UNCLEAR] is the back agya?

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:50.860
See the Spirit.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.900
that's how his eyes are.

00:37:55.805 --> 00:37:57.885
This is [UNCLEAR], this is spirit you see.

00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:01.000
You seek all the questions.

00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.015
[UNCLEAR]

00:38:04.015 --> 00:38:07.265
You see there is a, they become you see.

00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:12.320
Like a prism, they start giving you many many

00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.160
images, this that.

00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:18.820
This is spirit inside you.

00:38:25.835 --> 00:38:27.415
Yogi: 7 [UNCLEAR]?

00:38:27.905 --> 00:38:29.545
5 or 7? Mataji:5.

00:38:32.375 --> 00:38:33.455
[UNCLEAR]

00:38:36.565 --> 00:38:37.565
Mataji: He has read a lot.

00:38:40.705 --> 00:38:43.535
What he is doing is [UNCLEAR] isn't it? Yogi: Thank you very much.

00:38:43.860 --> 00:38:45.880
Mataji: He is realizing it's different

00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.160
Yogi: Thank you. Mataji: Yes.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:57.860
There's a book we have got, I will give you one. All right? You go through that. [UNCLEAR] give him that book.

00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:02.480
But now, you establish sahaja yoga here, all right?

00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:11.420
You have got a house or some work? Have you got a

00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:14.800
room or somewhere to stay? Yogi: I live alone [UNCLEAR] Mataji: Where?

00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:17.420
Yogi: In here in Madrid.

00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:22.760
I live in a flat by myself. Mataji: Yourself? Yogi: Because I am a brahmachari.

00:39:23.655 --> 00:39:24.655
 

00:39:26.425 --> 00:39:28.335
Mataji: All right, we will see your brahmacharya.

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.035
Mataji: With the Mother

00:39:32.255 --> 00:39:35.115
when you try the brahmacharya, I will put you to trouble.

00:39:37.620 --> 00:39:40.340
Yogi: With [UNCLEAR], who is the [UNCLEAR] ?

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:41.960
Mataji: No no, what I am saying

00:39:42.625 --> 00:39:43.625
if you try any

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.900
brahmacharya, you see

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:50.400
Mother is a playful thing, she plays, see,

00:39:51.085 --> 00:39:52.085
isn't it?

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:55.500
She is Kalawati.

00:39:56.060 --> 00:39:59.400
kala, very artistic, kundalini.

00:39:59.560 --> 00:40:01.180
She plays art with you.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.395
And she tries to bring you round, you see.

00:40:04.395 --> 00:40:06.925
All these ideas of brahmacharya will vanish soon.

00:40:08.485 --> 00:40:11.845
Yogi: I see, I need to raise my kundalini sooner.

00:40:11.980 --> 00:40:14.820
Mataji: No, no no. You are [UNCLEAR] there on top of your head. Just see.

00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.020
It's already risen, when are you going to rise? See yourself now.

00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.580
Feel it in your head, just come on

00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:27.280
All right? You don't have to rise anymore.

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.260
But

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:36.980
Now, if you get married, then realized souls are to be born, you know many realized souls are to be born.

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.360
All right?

00:40:38.395 --> 00:40:40.135
Souls are to be born.
