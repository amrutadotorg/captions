00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:40.880
Yogini: Mother, it's Mathias on the phone again, it's Mathias on the phone again, he's talking

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.440
about lamb and things, he wants to talk about the lamb.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.440
Shri Mataji: Lamb?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:47.440
Huh?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.440
Should I go in the room or?

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.440
Yogini: Is there a telephone extension in here?

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.630
Yogi: Yes.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.130
Yogini: Is there a point from the wall?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.480
Can anyone say point from the wall?

00:00:59.837 --> 00:01:05.407
Yogini: Otherwise, there's one in the kitchen, mother, which...

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:12.040
Shri Mataji: There's a meat company, you can talk to the meat company, I think Frank can do something

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
about it.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.040
So he wants to have an offer as soon as possible.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.040
Isn't it?

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:19.040
It's a good solution.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:48.280
It's maybe for this also you'll find this, but first of all this, there must be meat

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:49.680
companies here.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:50.680
Yogini: Oh, I'm sure there are, mother.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.680
As you say, Frank would be there.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.680
Shri Mataji: [unclear].

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.680
And the meat.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.680
[unclear]

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.680
To Poland.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
Both.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.450
To Poland.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.990
And to Bulgaria.

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:07.010
What?

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:44.050
I think he's remembering.
