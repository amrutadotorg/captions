00:00:01.508 --> 00:00:04.031
How it is placed within us.

00:00:05.396 --> 00:00:10.644
Nabhi chakra also has got two sides- left and right.

00:00:12.301 --> 00:00:15.082
On the left hand side of the Nabhi chakra

00:00:15.282 --> 00:00:21.655
is placed as a centre or you call it a chakra

00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:27.828
or a sub-chakra called as the Chandra means the moon.

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:31.159
It's the Moon centre on the left hand side,

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.234
and right hand side is the sun centre

00:00:35.028 --> 00:00:40.984
and they are placed exactly on the moon line and the sun line.

00:00:41.184 --> 00:00:43.643
That is first the Ida and the Pingala.

00:00:45.303 --> 00:00:51.552
These two centres are the two points up to which we can go

00:00:52.077 --> 00:00:54.376
[and] move from left to right.

00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:57.858
Beyond that when we start going you cross the limits.

00:01:00.204 --> 00:01:03.930
Now these two centres when localized,

00:01:04.574 --> 00:01:08.702
see they have vertical vibrations flow over to them

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:14.941
but when they are localized at that point how we spoil them.

00:01:17.224 --> 00:01:19.379
We must understand.

00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:25.586
Left Nabhi and right Nabhi are interdependent on each other.

00:01:26.057 --> 00:01:28.122
If you pull too much of left Nabhi

00:01:28.322 --> 00:01:31.747
or work too much on left Nabhi then right Nabhi also can catch.

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.975
But say we will take one by one.

00:01:35.444 --> 00:01:39.766
Now the left Nabhi is caught, normally if you eat food

00:01:39.966 --> 00:01:46.006
at somebody’s house who is a sort of spiritualist

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:52.188
or who is giving a prasad like say Satya Sai baba this horrible fellow,

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:57.214
his those vibhutis as they call it because it comes from the

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:00.855
cremation ground, see that ash,

00:02:02.108 --> 00:02:05.592
all these things and all these types of food when you eat...

00:02:05.814 --> 00:02:10.374
a person who believes in the past;

00:02:11.052 --> 00:02:15.369
in the Sanskrit past is bhoot is the word for past

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.405
or you can call it in the subconscious.

00:02:19.808 --> 00:02:22.342
That food carries the vibrations.

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.817
A person who has cooked specially that kind of a food

00:02:26.017 --> 00:02:31.986
can give you a left Nabhi to begin with, to begin.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:38.992
Now left Nabhi gives you superstitious temperament very superstitious, you become superstitious,

00:02:39.312 --> 00:02:41.795
you get frightened of things small things,

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:46.634
even in Sahaja Yoga you find such a person superstitions will be there

00:02:47.042 --> 00:02:51.805
and these superstitions can be very very dangerous.

00:02:53.106 --> 00:02:57.495
Now how to overcome this left Nabhi problem?

00:02:57.907 --> 00:03:03.350
Is to leave everything as far as superstition is concerned.

00:03:04.018 --> 00:03:08.288
Now see you see a cat crossing the road.

00:03:09.081 --> 00:03:14.861
Now you know that it’s a bad thing...you cross that road deliberately.

00:03:16.812 --> 00:03:22.212
You see that right hand has to be put for this and left hand is to be put for that,

00:03:22.412 --> 00:03:25.138
by mistake you do something wrong just go ahead with it.

00:03:27.932 --> 00:03:31.545
Don’t get frightened of anything at that time you see it frightens you.

00:03:31.903 --> 00:03:36.116
Superstitions come out of fear and fright that is built,

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:41.466
any superstition whatsoever. Now you can take it in a wider scale:

00:03:41.666 --> 00:03:46.793
for example people are superstitious about nations,

00:03:47.857 --> 00:03:51.865
oh, he is Jew,

00:03:52.065 --> 00:03:55.635
he is Greek, he is Russian, he is Indian, he is British…

00:03:55.842 --> 00:03:58.672
you see sort of these are collective superstitions

00:03:58.872 --> 00:04:02.109
which are impressed on us so much so that we are superstitious

00:04:02.483 --> 00:04:05.479
and we start judging them accordingly.

00:04:06.284 --> 00:04:10.915
So the superstition can be only overcome by facing them directly.

00:04:11.115 --> 00:04:13.053
All right see what happens.

00:04:13.767 --> 00:04:16.690
Any small or big or collective.

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:21.361
As I said a small thing like a cat passing is a small one.

00:04:21.561 --> 00:04:24.765
In a big way people will say,

00:04:25.703 --> 00:04:29.703
I mean, there are all kinds of superstitions if you can think about

00:04:29.903 --> 00:04:33.974
..anything like say now Alex is a pilot

00:04:34.174 --> 00:04:37.277
and he knows that how pilots work out superstitions

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.582
and they work on omens and things, they go to fortune tellers

00:04:41.782 --> 00:04:44.884
and ask them whether this is good or that is bad and all.

00:04:45.084 --> 00:04:47.554
The more they do it and the more they catch,

00:04:47.754 --> 00:04:50.724
and the more they do it, it becomes a bad omen for them.

00:04:50.924 --> 00:04:54.595
You see, it’s such a vicious circle it goes on building in them.

00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:57.993
Now the essence of the whole thing is that

00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:03.269
see why we are afraid because we are afraid of the subconscious dominations.

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:08.328
We are trying to get rid of the subconscious domination, that’s what we are afraid of.

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:14.181
But as a result of superstitious nature we fall more into the subconscious

00:05:15.095 --> 00:05:17.117
and start accepting it.

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:21.655
Now in this I will tell you in India there is a girl Nima you know very well.

00:05:22.293 --> 00:05:26.427
She has a left Nabhi. Most of the Jainis they have. Jain people they have [it].

00:05:26.627 --> 00:05:32.365
The reason is they are brought up like that in superstitions because Mahavira himself

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.703
told them that don’t go near the subconscious

00:05:36.903 --> 00:05:38.605
and he described the whole subconscious.

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:42.709
So all his disciples are became slaves of subconscious directly.

00:05:42.909 --> 00:05:46.647
Just imagine. What a shame it is. I mean when you see that

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:52.085
you have to take his name, Mahavira’s name and he became so much abandoned about that.

00:05:52.285 --> 00:05:56.271
So much abandoned that he went to such a limit,

00:05:56.471 --> 00:06:01.228
that once he was walking on the road and they said, ‘don’t go today because it’s a bad day

00:06:01.428 --> 00:06:03.763
and you will have some problem’. He said,’ I will go’.

00:06:04.383 --> 00:06:08.602
He was going through a jungle and then a wind started blowing

00:06:08.945 --> 00:06:12.839
and he had one big cloth wrapped around his body

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.543
and the cloth got caught up in a bush.

00:06:18.446 --> 00:06:25.018
So people said, ’See we had said that we should not have come now half cloth is gone’. So he cut his half cloth,

00:06:28.245 --> 00:06:30.624
so he was left with half.

00:06:30.824 --> 00:06:34.732
Then next time he was going somewhere and people said that don’t go that way,

00:06:34.932 --> 00:06:37.931
there are too many problems and you will have a bad time.

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:40.364
He said, ‘what bad time will I have?’

00:06:40.564 --> 00:06:42.900
...so was going and he found a man

00:06:43.257 --> 00:06:47.040
lying in a very bad condition

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.045
and all wounds in his body and all the small,

00:06:52.938 --> 00:06:57.259
what you call this germs and all flies and small..

00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.194
Yogi: Maggots. Shri Mataji: What you call that? Yogi: Maggots.

00:07:00.394 --> 00:07:07.026
Shri Mataji: They were all trying to trouble him so he covered his body with half of cloth (audio reversed).

00:07:24.823 --> 00:07:28.314
They are so terrible, so terrible in their superstitions

00:07:28.514 --> 00:07:33.019
that they think that you should abandon to such a limit that you shouldn’t go to the barber,

00:07:33.219 --> 00:07:35.385
so they go on all the time picking their heads.

00:07:36.187 --> 00:07:39.584
See they don’t wear any dresses, nothing they wear.

00:07:39.785 --> 00:07:41.628
Can you imagine such horrible people.

00:07:41.829 --> 00:07:48.969
Once it happened, you don’t have to go to America for this, in India you can see this very inauspicious thing.

00:07:49.169 --> 00:07:52.414
My husband was collector you see of one district

00:07:52.615 --> 00:07:58.344
and they invited us because there was some problem between their two sets Shwethambars and Digambaras

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:01.314
and the Shwethambaras are people who wear white dresses at least,

00:08:01.514 --> 00:08:05.041
but the Digambaras don’t wear anything. They are gurus who just move about like that,

00:08:05.242 --> 00:08:09.022
absolutely without even a single thing on their body

00:08:09.463 --> 00:08:13.863
and with me the collector and Mrs collector were very nicely (inaudible) you see

00:08:14.063 --> 00:08:16.463
they had come to a big gathering

00:08:16.663 --> 00:08:19.833
and sat there before us on this platform. Can you imagine?

00:08:20.033 --> 00:08:23.266
All these naked people sitting

00:08:23.466 --> 00:08:28.107
and they were putting hands up and this and they were pulling all their hair from everywhere

00:08:28.307 --> 00:08:30.677
..it was such a horrid situation

00:08:30.877 --> 00:08:34.447
and my husband is a very shy fellow you see…he didn’t know where to look

00:08:36.615 --> 00:08:42.150
He said 'what sort of a thing is this?, Do you know anything about it?'.

00:08:42.535 --> 00:08:47.209
I said 'I know'. [He said] 'Well why didn’t you tell me, why I'm...

00:08:47.471 --> 00:08:50.897
I mean he was absolutely perspiring in shame, you see

00:08:51.097 --> 00:08:54.501
and I think at least 40-50 people sitting on top of your head there,

00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:57.537
just you can’t imagine, to even raise your eyes.

00:08:57.892 --> 00:09:02.809
Horrid lanky panky dirty fellows sitting down there, they don’t take their baths

00:09:03.009 --> 00:09:06.313
and they go to such a limit of superstition.

00:09:06.693 --> 00:09:08.581
So this is one side of it.

00:09:08.781 --> 00:09:14.395
Now the Jains themselves to what limit they went you see. They said you should not kill anybody, that’s all.

00:09:14.595 --> 00:09:17.056
You should not kill anybody up to that point is right,

00:09:17.256 --> 00:09:20.954
but that went to such a limit that in Jains what they do,

00:09:21.155 --> 00:09:26.118
they don’t kill mosquitoes they don’t kill bugs, they don’t have ….. (Audio is reversed).

00:09:26.318 --> 00:09:33.368
They don't use because you (Audio is reversed).

00:09:33.568 --> 00:09:36.809
Put it down because...
