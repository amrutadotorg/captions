00:40.280 --> 00:43.940
Today we have decided to have Mahakali Puja.

00:43.940 --> 00:57.380
Now we must understand the Mahakali is in
totality - is a reflection of Adi Shakti,

00:57.380 --> 00:58.430
in totality.

00:58.430 --> 01:07.491
Or we can call it that Adi Shakti is in charge,
She’s managing all these three powers, but

01:07.491 --> 01:18.050
Her manifestation in totality is Mahakali
in the sense that it is the desire of God

01:18.050 --> 01:19.940
Almighty.

01:19.940 --> 01:30.270
So first She's Adi Shakti in charge of all
the three powers and that's why we can say

01:30.270 --> 01:39.789
that when She is in a potential stage, She
is Mahakali.

01:39.789 --> 01:54.210
And then She divides Herself into two other
forces as Mahasaraswati and the ascending

01:54.210 --> 02:03.120
force that we call, or as a parasympathetic
nervous system expressed in us is the Mahalakshmi,

02:03.120 --> 02:07.729
so She has actually all these forces in Herself.

02:07.729 --> 02:17.400
Mahakali has all these forces but She manifests,
She desires to act and when She wants to act,

02:17.400 --> 02:24.090
Her potential force becomes these two other
forces.

02:24.090 --> 02:31.790
So when we do the Puja of Mahakali, we must
understand that inbuilt within this force

02:31.790 --> 02:38.660
within us is desire, so we can desire anything.

02:38.660 --> 02:49.560
If you want you can desire everything: we
can desire, say, the joy, we can desire the

02:49.560 --> 02:55.909
knowledge, we can desire to be compassionate
and love and we can desire also the destruction

02:55.909 --> 02:58.379
of those which are negative forces.

02:58.379 --> 03:07.620
But the Mahakali force is the one which is
working out the constructive force, but in

03:07.620 --> 03:14.099
that constructive force only there has to
be destruction, because if you are constructing

03:14.099 --> 03:21.020
something and there is destruction, which
is trying to destroy your construction, then

03:21.020 --> 03:24.659
you have to destroy that destructive person.

03:24.659 --> 03:32.650
And this is what people sometimes misunderstand
and they think that Mahakali force is negative

03:32.650 --> 03:35.280
force or is a force of destruction.

03:35.280 --> 03:43.099
It is, but in a very positive way.

03:43.099 --> 03:47.260
And if you understand this part of Mahakali
force then you’ll understand that if you

03:47.260 --> 03:56.159
have desires to construct yourself properly
in Sahaja Yoga, then you should also have

03:56.159 --> 04:04.879
the desire to destroy whatever is standing
against your construction.

04:04.879 --> 04:12.750
So one by one, we should see within ourselves
what sort of things that tag us down and thus

04:12.750 --> 04:15.360
they do not give us this desire.

04:15.360 --> 04:23.970
If this desire becomes intense, then you start
immediately seeing what are the forces that

04:23.970 --> 04:27.120
are destroying your ascent.

04:27.120 --> 04:29.320
So we have to ascend is the point.

04:29.320 --> 04:36.669
Our goal is to ascend, our destination is
to ascend, so our desire should be that we

04:36.669 --> 04:47.330
should ascend and construct our being in such
a manner that we can receive all the…

04:47.330 --> 04:55.840
Hindi aside
This one is better.

04:55.840 --> 05:03.290
So we should understand that we have to be
prepared to destroy many things within us,

05:03.290 --> 05:11.560
if we have to become great evolved personalities.

05:11.560 --> 05:18.370
As you have seen in evolution itself: we had
huge big animals like mammoth, this, that,

05:18.370 --> 05:23.210
and they could not cope with the evolution,
so they were all destroyed - so many things

05:23.210 --> 05:26.919
were destroyed.

05:26.919 --> 05:33.120
And this destruction is built in within us:
when we ascend we just start seeing that these

05:33.120 --> 05:46.380
are the forces which we are destroying us
and that our destruction is so much that,

05:46.380 --> 05:53.130
if we do not desire the destruction of these
destructive forces, we’ll be finished.

05:53.130 --> 06:00.750
So at the same time when we are ascending
higher, we have to know what we have to destroy.

06:00.750 --> 06:12.830
For example, even in living forces when a
flower becomes a fruit, lots of things which

06:12.830 --> 06:19.320
were the part of the flower get destroyed,
automatically.

06:19.320 --> 06:29.610
But that is done in the will of God by his
own understanding, so it's absolutely perfect.

06:29.610 --> 06:35.340
So in Sahaja Yoga when we desire something,
we must know what do we desire, first fix

06:35.340 --> 06:41.960
your goal and then relate it to that.

06:41.960 --> 06:49.020
Now there are many deviations in life, like
you are going to the airport, our attention

06:49.020 --> 06:53.920
should be ‘we have to reach the airport’
and whatever are distractions are distractions,

06:53.920 --> 06:56.240
we should not get lost with it.

06:56.240 --> 07:02.090
If you get lost with those distractions, then
we cannot achieve our goal in time.

07:02.090 --> 07:13.819
So one has to understand first of all that
our goal is to ascend and for that the distructions

07:13.819 --> 07:19.389
are on our way, because of ourselves, because
of ignorance, because of darkness, because

07:19.389 --> 07:22.539
the light is not so much.

07:22.539 --> 07:32.289
The first destroying factor that is within
us is the Shri Ganesha’s power and this

07:32.289 --> 07:36.669
Shri Ganesha is the power of Mahakali.

07:36.669 --> 07:43.000
She first planted Shri Ganesh to emit holiness
on this earth.

07:43.000 --> 07:50.500
So the whole thing could be vibrated and as
you know one aspect of Shri Ganesh is also

07:50.500 --> 07:56.820
Omkara, means this vibratory awareness which
flows everywhere.

07:56.820 --> 08:10.970
So these vibrations have four sites in it:
one is that these vibrations establish holiness,

08:10.970 --> 08:24.160
auspiciousness through Mahakali power, then
these same vibrations also comfort us through

08:24.160 --> 08:33.250
Mahakali power, vibrations do not give you
desires as such, if you see, they do not give

08:33.250 --> 08:42.300
you desires, but they give you proof of your
desires being fulfilled.

08:42.300 --> 08:48.000
Supposing you want somebody to be cured, this
is your desire and you give vibrations to

08:48.000 --> 08:53.930
that person, so it’s a means.

08:53.930 --> 09:04.449
So it is also the action part which is there
in those vibrations, but this action also

09:04.449 --> 09:10.260
comes from desire, if you don’t have desire
you won’t act.

09:10.260 --> 09:20.030
So the desire is so important even to establish
your own path, to establish your forward march:

09:20.030 --> 09:27.470
if your desire is poor, if you’re half-hearted,
you can’t work it out.

09:27.470 --> 09:32.000
Half-hearted people cannot achieve anything
in Sahaja Yoga, it's not meant for half-hearted

09:32.000 --> 09:46.130
people, it's meant for people who are brave,
who have intense desire, who are intelligent

09:46.130 --> 09:51.579
and who are auspicious.

09:51.579 --> 10:02.189
But in case you do not have intense desire,
then the pure desire doesn't work and you

10:02.189 --> 10:05.210
do not get your Realization.

10:05.210 --> 10:13.189
Also after getting Realization, unless and
until you have desire to ascend, very strong

10:13.189 --> 10:17.500
intense desire to ascend, you cannot ascend.

10:17.500 --> 10:22.900
So for all Sahaja Yogis it is necessary to,
first of all, early in the morning, while

10:22.900 --> 10:28.560
taking the name of Ganesha, must say “What
is my desire, this is my goal.”

10:28.560 --> 10:34.850
This is what it is, all activity must be surrendered
for this goal.

10:34.850 --> 10:40.940
So now, how our desires are curbed?

10:40.940 --> 10:48.290
First of all, through conditionings, we have
certain conditionings.

10:48.290 --> 10:57.020
After Sahaja Yoga, people become very affectionate,
so immediately - even if in the west where

10:57.020 --> 11:03.540
the family is not so important, children not
so important, selfishness is there, people

11:03.540 --> 11:12.440
think about themselves only, they cannot think
of others - even in those countries, it starts

11:12.440 --> 11:23.270
developing a kind of a, another cocoon of
‘my-ness’: my child, my house, my home,

11:23.270 --> 11:27.840
my family.

11:27.840 --> 11:33.959
Then the attention starts working on that,
you become half-hearted towards your ascent,

11:33.959 --> 11:49.620
because you’re ascending in a way, so-called,
and also you are spreading out.

11:49.620 --> 11:58.660
Then the concern goes to other conditionings
we have, like the other day I met one fellow,

11:58.660 --> 12:03.770
he said that, “Mother, I am a Sahaja Yogi,
I know, but I can’t get over the idea of

12:03.770 --> 12:04.770
Christ.”

12:04.770 --> 12:07.940
I said, “Who has asked you to get over idea
of Christ?

12:07.940 --> 12:13.799
Christ is there, in Sahaja Yoga very much,
but understand it in its own comprehensive

12:13.799 --> 12:16.980
way and see for yourself.”

12:16.980 --> 12:20.300
But this conditioning is of thoughts.

12:20.300 --> 12:28.350
Supposing, if you have read too many books,
if you have gone through, supposing, you are

12:28.350 --> 12:35.280
a born Hindu or a born Christian or a born
Jew or anything, so the conditioning is there.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.140
You were born as a human being!

12:37.140 --> 12:43.880
You got this stamp later on (Shri Mataji laughing)
that you are a Hindu or a Christian or anything.

12:43.880 --> 12:46.760
This stamp you did not carry when you were
born.

12:46.760 --> 12:51.910
Supposing, the child was lost, he could be
any religion.

12:51.910 --> 13:00.250
So these are not really your innate religions,
this is just a stamp you have got, like Christian

13:00.250 --> 13:01.620
or anything.

13:01.620 --> 13:05.640
Then you have another conditioning that you
belong to this nation, that nation, like we

13:05.640 --> 13:15.569
have, we have America, this, that, that, but
still these are stamps, you were born in America,

13:15.569 --> 13:18.040
that's why you are an American.

13:18.040 --> 13:22.190
Anybody who is born in America is not different
from anybody else.

13:22.190 --> 13:28.160
Only thing according to the climate of a particular
place, you might have your complexion, your

13:28.160 --> 13:34.650
height, your face and all that, but that doesn't
mean that innately this is meant for America,

13:34.650 --> 13:38.669
it could be anywhere.

13:38.669 --> 13:44.179
Then all this conditionings within us start
acting on our language, on our styles, on

13:44.179 --> 13:49.500
our lives in every way, then we start becoming
Americans.

13:49.500 --> 13:55.730
So these are the effects of the outside that
come in us and then we say “We, the Americans”,

13:55.730 --> 14:04.670
but if you scratch them, inside body’s the
same, heart is the same, the blood is the

14:04.670 --> 14:13.910
same - everything is the same, there’s nothing
different, it's even not skin deep, but in

14:13.910 --> 14:19.120
the brain it has gone that ‘I am an American’.

14:19.120 --> 14:26.699
Then all these things that are in that society,
for example, in America so many things are

14:26.699 --> 14:30.020
allowed, so that's all right.

14:30.020 --> 14:33.730
In India many things are allowed, that's all
right.

14:33.730 --> 14:39.040
Like that we start accepting the society,
the norms of the society and the conditioning

14:39.040 --> 14:42.730
starts.

14:42.730 --> 14:49.049
But with all that this desire is there, the
pure desire to ascend.

14:49.049 --> 14:56.430
Aside: I think, you put these lights little
ahead because they are so, paper there and

14:56.430 --> 15:01.920
with My force, light is going behind.

15:01.920 --> 15:10.100
No, no, not that one, please, because they
are facing that fan.

15:10.100 --> 15:15.640
Could bring them down here.

15:15.640 --> 15:24.600
Still quite close to that fan you know, you
can put them anywhere, you can put them here,

15:24.600 --> 15:30.169
if you want.

15:30.169 --> 15:45.600
You see, because the air is blowing that way
and they are all going that way.

15:45.600 --> 15:53.970
So the desire within us to ascend comes to
us also as a reaction to all these things.

15:53.970 --> 16:02.510
When we see, as Americans, what's happening
to our country, what's happening to the people,

16:02.510 --> 16:09.069
what's happening to our surroundings and then
we get a shock, “Oh God!

16:09.069 --> 16:11.990
What is this?”

16:11.990 --> 16:14.000
Then we also see this is artificiality.

16:14.000 --> 16:19.330
Like in England you have to wear a tail coat,
you have to wear this, you have to have this

16:19.330 --> 16:24.640
kind of a spoon, this kind of a glass, this,
that, so reaction builds in.

16:24.640 --> 16:34.160
So you start anti-culture, anti-culture to
get rid of artificiality, while the desire

16:34.160 --> 16:38.150
behind is, is to seek the reality.

16:38.150 --> 16:44.390
To seek reality, then they have hair just
like primitive people, they live like primitive

16:44.390 --> 16:49.140
people and the reaction is built in.

16:49.140 --> 16:52.860
Behind all that is the same desire, is to
ascend.

16:52.860 --> 17:01.230
So this Mahalaxmi power is acting within us,
it is giving us all kinds of shows, we can

17:01.230 --> 17:07.939
say, “All right, you want to have, say,
variety of things, go ahead with it.”

17:07.939 --> 17:12.970
Then you go crazy, you see, “What's this
going on?

17:12.970 --> 17:16.110
Why should we be so mad about it?

17:16.110 --> 17:27.299
” Now they want to have -

17:27.299 --> 17:34.750
you want to have say, your children, your
home, your houses, then you just get fed up

17:34.750 --> 17:41.230
with it, because children become arrogant,
they become horrid, they trouble you, then

17:41.230 --> 17:42.230
you say, “Oh God!

17:42.230 --> 17:44.920
I'll never have any children any more.”

17:44.920 --> 17:50.400
Then you have wives and you find wives horrible
and husbands horrible, then you divorce.

17:50.400 --> 17:55.140
You go on divorcing, divorcing, divorcing
and then you find it's useless, it doesn't

17:55.140 --> 18:04.060
work out, nothing seems to work out, you feel
so frustrated and that action and reaction

18:04.060 --> 18:10.860
works on your desires, so your desires go
on changing.

18:10.860 --> 18:20.540
Specially when we are wanting to be affluent,
people become affluent and then they find

18:20.540 --> 18:27.930
the problems of affluence, so a reaction is
built in.

18:27.930 --> 18:35.560
Those who witness those problems of the rich,
they don't want to be that rich, nothing doing.

18:35.560 --> 18:42.130
So in every way the desire to achieve things
works out, like some people want to have power,

18:42.130 --> 18:49.840
they go into politics, fight it, get it done
and done forever.

18:49.840 --> 19:00.250
So, lives after lives it goes on, then you
are born in modern times, when I’m here

19:00.250 --> 19:09.890
and now your only strong desire is to become
the Spirit, I hope it is.

19:09.890 --> 19:17.899
So now all these back things are to be crossed
over, they are finished.

19:17.899 --> 19:25.410
Now what should we do for our Realization,
what action we should take?

19:25.410 --> 19:34.840
The first action is to develop your Mahakali
power: by one power you destroy all that is

19:34.840 --> 19:44.240
nonsensical, destroy all that is impeding
you, troubling you, blocking you - destroy

19:44.240 --> 19:55.640
all that, just I don't want it, because I’ve
seen Sahaja Yogis suddenly go off, like you

19:55.640 --> 20:01.690
have to go to the airport, suddenly you find
they have fallen into one of the gutters,

20:01.690 --> 20:04.280
“What happened?

20:04.280 --> 20:11.110
“ “Mother, we felt like going there”,
but why?

20:11.110 --> 20:17.120
So keep your attention on that point.

20:17.120 --> 20:22.810
Some people get married - in Sahaja Yoga also
they have a desire to marry, have children,

20:22.810 --> 20:26.010
this thing - but in that also they get fixed
up.

20:26.010 --> 20:33.680
Marriage is not the end, it’s just one of
the means to be balanced.

20:33.680 --> 20:42.750
So we have to have desire that we have to
achieve something, so go on destroying all

20:42.750 --> 20:50.510
that is within us, within us is - there are
six enemies, as they say, is anger, then greed,

20:50.510 --> 21:01.380
jealousies, violence, - all these are within
us, so we have to destroy these six enemies.

21:01.380 --> 21:08.870
But what's the power of a Mahakali is that
She destroys all the enemies that stand in

21:08.870 --> 21:15.730
your way, all the rakshasas, all the devils,
all the negative forces, She tries to destroy,

21:15.730 --> 21:17.750
so that your part should be all right.

21:17.750 --> 21:21.140
But while She is destroying all of them, if
you are sticking on to them, what can She

21:21.140 --> 21:23.530
do?

21:23.530 --> 21:28.260
So your desire should be pure and that you
should say that, “All right, we want to

21:28.260 --> 21:32.680
achieve that“, and She is working it out
for you.

21:32.680 --> 21:39.270
This is the first thing, Her job.

21:39.270 --> 21:45.780
Then the second job is that She comforts,
She gives you comforts - of every kind.

21:45.780 --> 21:52.720
The first comfort She gives you is of your
body: your body becomes comfortable, means

21:52.720 --> 21:59.920
all your diseases and all your troubles are
destroyed, you find that your body becomes

21:59.920 --> 22:07.260
healthy, you feel younger, you get energy
and you can work out your Realization - this

22:07.260 --> 22:12.120
is the first thing She does for you, is to
give you comfort.

22:12.120 --> 22:25.230
Then She also gives you comfort of the Spirit,
so that you do not ask for artificial comforts,

22:25.230 --> 22:32.620
you can live anywhere - you can live in a
jungle, you are comfortable, if you live in

22:32.620 --> 22:38.571
the most busiest place, you are comfortable
- so you are comfortable everywhere and that

22:38.571 --> 22:44.140
sort of a comfort She can establish within
you.

22:44.140 --> 22:57.320
Then the highest of all Her boon is that She
gives you they joy, joy of every kind, joy

22:57.320 --> 23:02.820
that emits from everything, from everyone.

23:02.820 --> 23:10.200
So that is the highest you get when you keep
your desire, the flame of your desire burning,

23:10.200 --> 23:22.450
till you reach that state of spiritual attainment,
then you find that no more desire is left,

23:22.450 --> 23:27.610
but only one, if it is any, that let the whole
world be realised.

23:27.610 --> 23:34.370
Like a drunkard, you see, he wants to enjoy
his drinking with others, like that you become:

23:34.370 --> 23:39.870
you are drunk in your joy and why not others
enjoy, so you work for it.

23:39.870 --> 23:47.000
But human beings, I’ve seen, they move like
a yo-yo.

23:47.000 --> 23:53.270
They achieve their spiritual attainment, they
have the joy and then they go back to help

23:53.270 --> 23:55.610
people, they get caught up with them.

23:55.610 --> 24:01.740
They are not strong enough, because the Mahakali
power is not strong.

24:01.740 --> 24:08.150
And another is the weakness of the Mooladhara.

24:08.150 --> 24:17.930
Weakness of the Mooladhara makes you imbalanced
and in that imbalance you lose your way.

24:17.930 --> 24:24.750
So one has to be very careful that our Mooladhara
must be fixed properly.

24:24.750 --> 24:28.530
There are so many ways by which you can fix
up your Mooladhara.

24:28.530 --> 24:36.870
And you must fix up your Mooladhara first,
then your desire absolutely moves like a kite

24:36.870 --> 24:37.870
moves in the sky.

24:37.870 --> 24:44.340
Stuck to Mooladhara and you can move into
any direction to any height, wherever you

24:44.340 --> 24:53.402
go, you are quite in charge, you know how
you are moving.

24:53.402 --> 25:00.580
It can bind your attention, everything, so
what we say that the roots are very important

25:00.580 --> 25:08.130
first to be established for the growth of
your desire upward like a tree.

25:08.130 --> 25:16.090
So they go hand in hand - Mahakali power and
Ganesha's power - go hand in hand, because

25:16.090 --> 25:18.430
that's the foundation.

25:18.430 --> 25:26.040
If it is based on that foundation, desires
grow much stronger and stronger and effective

25:26.040 --> 25:30.620
and they do not deviate.

25:30.620 --> 25:38.520
Every sort of desire is fulfilled till you
reach that state where there's no other desire

25:38.520 --> 25:49.780
left but to enjoy, you just enjoy, without
any desire, desirelessly you enjoy.

25:49.780 --> 25:54.059
And that state is to be enjoyed, just to be
enjoyed.

25:54.059 --> 25:57.880
What is there to talk about it, what is there
to say about it?

25:57.880 --> 26:04.620
You just are lost in the ocean of enjoyment.

26:04.620 --> 26:11.830
And that should happen everywhere and that's
what you are worshipping.

26:11.830 --> 26:18.000
So now I hope you have 108 names of Mahakali,
and if you have the 108 of Mahakali, you will

26:18.000 --> 26:27.980
see, one by one, that Her is stages of Her
working out for you, how manifest that you

26:27.980 --> 26:31.950
can see in those names.

26:31.950 --> 26:42.830
So now first we'll have a one Atharva Sheersha
and then we can have these 108 names.

26:42.830 --> 26:47.450
Can we?

26:47.450 --> 26:51.020
When he’s here, I’m happy to see you.

26:51.020 --> 26:54.290
We did a Puja there also, Canada also did
it.

26:54.290 --> 39:24.680
I think, it is very important to do Mahakali
power, because that's the first

39:24.680 --> 41:17.680
power

41:17.680 --> 42:23.360
that starts manifesting.
