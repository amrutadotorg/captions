00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.840
I would like to announce and therefore&nbsp;
it is a very unique and very auspicious&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:21.600
day today that the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi  Sahaja&nbsp;
Yoga Foundation has been created today&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:29.680
and is going to be signed tomorrow. So&nbsp;
I would like you to give a big big clap.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:37.840
NIPC is Shri Mataji Corporation. It is Her&nbsp;
company. It is a legal entity that our beloved&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:46.480
Mother was the president is the president&nbsp; and always will be the president to guide us.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.960
NIPC was established under the direction of the&nbsp;
Adi Shaki on the 21st of July 2005. Its purpose&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.760
is to preserve, protect and distribute our beloved&nbsp;
Mother's sacred knowledge which is Her teachings,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:09.200
lectures, writings and all recordings made in&nbsp;
Her presence. She transferred this intellectual&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:19.520
property to NIPC on the 16th of September 2005. It&nbsp;
is the most auspicious and most precious company in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.800
the history of mankind. It is beyond value.&nbsp;
It is a unique gift that will be there till&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:35.520
the end of time. This is the first time that the original teachings of an incarnation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:45.920
could be recorded and then preserved and&nbsp;
safeguarded. This is this was never possible in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:56.560
the history of man. So NIPC is the first entity&nbsp;
ever that holds the treasure of the full teachings&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.000
not only of a Divine Incarnation but&nbsp;
of the Incarnation of Shri Adi Shakti Herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
As we celebrate this 20 years of anniversary,&nbsp;
we are reminded of the impact and the importance&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.640
of our mission. Each digital archive,&nbsp;
each restored speech, each shared teaching&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:26.480
is a testament to the commitment to preserve,&nbsp;
propagate the essence of spiritual knowledge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:37.280
spiritual awakening for the future generations.&nbsp;
Shri Mataji, these are the documents representing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.320
all of your talks and tapes. All of the talks&nbsp;
you've given over the years, 35 years of your&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:55.040
knowledge and teachings, the sacred knowledge&nbsp;
of Sahaj Yoga that you've given to us.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.880
Now this foundation will manage them, will&nbsp;
modernize them and keep them forever and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.160
spread Your message throughout the world.&nbsp;
It's a very historic responsibility. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:20.880
what you have to do is to authorize them.&nbsp;
Do you have signed that? Yes. Yeah. And

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.160
what you write in?

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.160
Nirmala

00:03:26.309 --> 00:03:29.290
It's okay. Okay.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.290
Nirmala is ok

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.290
Nirmala

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:45.440
Is it okay? It's okay. Same here. Yeah.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.920
two 3,000 talks Shri Mataji they will all now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:03.520
be preserved by this foundation and&nbsp;
it will be spread around the world.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.925
Thank you

00:04:05.925 --> 00:04:10.545
Shri Mataji on behalf of the Sahaja Yogis&nbsp;
of all the world

00:04:10.545 --> 00:04:13.010
and the people of all the world

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.514
the World Foundation, Your foundation&nbsp;
the Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi Sahaja Yoga Foundation

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:23.413
humbly and gratefully accept this&nbsp;
responsibility

00:04:23.413 --> 00:04:33.840
to preserve your talks for all eternity Shri Mataj so they're available&nbsp;
forever and ever for people all around the world. 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.840
Jai Shri Mataji

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:44.160
This is forever and ever. Your word will&nbsp;
reach every corner of the world and it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:54.720
will go on and on and on until every human&nbsp;
being has become a Sahaja Yogi. That's the wish.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.996
20 years ago on the 16th of September in 2005,

00:04:58.996 --> 00:05:05.863
a truly significant moment in the history of Sahaja Yoga occurred when Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi

00:05:05.863 --> 00:05:10.092
granted Her intellectual property to the recently formed

00:05:10.092 --> 00:05:18.940
Nirmal Intellectual Property Corporation&nbsp;
or NIPC.  In so doing, She ensured that Her Holy&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:19.116 --> 00:05:22.797
words and sacred knowledge would be preserved&nbsp;

00:05:22.797 --> 00:05:27.410
and protected for future generations of seekers&nbsp;&nbsp;all over the world.

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:34.480
 Mother told us at that&nbsp;
time, you have it now, you should protect it.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:43.200
So since then we develop a lot of work and I'm&nbsp;
sure this work is going to continue protecting but&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:47.665
also disseminating Her talks to the four corners&nbsp;of the world. 

00:05:47.665 --> 00:05:50.720
There are over 3,000 events recorded&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:50.720 --> 00:06:01.360
with Shri Mataji some as early as 1972. NIPC's&nbsp;
mission remains to preserve protect and distribute&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:09.520
Her sacred knowledge. Devi Productions does the&nbsp;
work of preservation. Nirmala Vidya is the operating&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:18.880
arm of NIPC which protects the works amongst many&nbsp;
other assignments. Amruta and the Nirmal Vidya App&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:26.080
are the distribution platforms. All this task is&nbsp;
tremendous. There's a tremendous responsibility&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:33.840
and it is a very appropriate moment&nbsp;
to give sincerious appreciation and thanks&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.960
to everybody who has been working for this&nbsp;
momentous and and and most relevant and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:50.720
important task. And it is of course also a moment&nbsp;
to bow in gratitude and and eternal thanks to our&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.120
Divine Mother, for this tremendous gift&nbsp;
to all of us and to humanity. And we are all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:10.000
working on it to make it available for today&nbsp;
and for tomorrow when perhaps as She once has said&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:13.270
Her teachings may become the law of men.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:26.720
Today&nbsp;NIPC is more than a platform. It is a radiant beacon of Divine love open to all transparent for&nbsp;
all eternity and a universal spiritual treasure.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.360
Through Her Divine words and infinite&nbsp;
compassion, Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi revealed&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:40.320
the purity at the heart of every great&nbsp;
incarnation. Doras, Moses, Buddha,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:47.920
confucius, Jesus and Prophet Muhammad and many&nbsp;
others. Through Her travels across continent,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:57.600
She offered humanity the transformative knowledge.&nbsp;
What Rumi called the light beyond all knowledge,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:05.840
opening the door to mass self-realization. This&nbsp;
is not just truth. It is living Divine reality&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:05.840 --> 00:08:14.160
confirmed by science felt through Sahaja meditation&nbsp;
and accessible to all seekers of absolute Truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:26.155
Her Divine presence awaken humanity to truth&nbsp;
its source and inner rebirth all trench in Her&nbsp;Eternal love.

00:08:26.307 --> 00:08:36.284
Shri Mataji this knowledge is much greater&nbsp;
than the scriptures like Gita, Bible, Quran etc.

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:45.323
I was involved since 1988 till 2005 in the work of&nbsp;
Sahaja audio

00:08:45.323 --> 00:08:58.291
and Sahaja video in Delhi for preserving the originals and also making copies and supplying all&nbsp;
over the India for cassettes and CDs.

00:08:58.291 --> 00:09:03.423
So I thanks Shri Mataji for that opportunity given to me.

00:09:03.423 --> 00:09:06.800
They&nbsp;are asking for your blessings Shri Mataji for the

00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:14.720
for the project of archiving and digitizing all&nbsp;
the old video talks and distributing them amongst&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:09:14.720 --> 00:09:15.775
the world.

00:09:15.775 --> 00:09:16.275
where?

00:09:16.275 --> 00:09:24.454
amongst all the Sahaja Yogis but&nbsp;
also some of them also to non-Sahaja Yogis so that everybody will see your your talks.

00:09:24.454 --> 00:09:33.864
In olden&nbsp;times we used to we used to have video cassettes but now there's a new technology and we are&nbsp;
going to use these DVDs

00:09:33.864 --> 00:09:39.419
and they are going to be distributed and sold to the Sahaja Yogis.

00:09:39.419 --> 00:09:41.065
That's&nbsp;my speech.

00:09:41.324 --> 00:09:49.952
Yes Shri Mataji. This is one that's a DVD that's from one of those. Yes. 

00:09:49.952 --> 00:09:53.685
And they will last for&nbsp;
a long time. They won't get spoiled by time. 

00:09:53.685 --> 00:10:00.880
You know earlier on the technology was not there&nbsp;
but they used to do some quality over time. Now&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:06.638
they have modernized it so that it will remain&nbsp;
as it is good quality for many years.

00:10:06.638 --> 00:10:08.672
In this puja you'll give?

00:10:08.672 --> 00:10:11.468
some of them.

00:10:11.624 --> 00:10:16.935
Yes. We will start&nbsp;
selling now. We will have opened a stand and we will start selling to the Sahaja Yogis 

00:10:16.935 --> 00:10:18.347
when?

00:10:18.347 --> 00:10:20.024
 from&nbsp;tomorrow 

00:10:20.024 --> 00:10:27.956
On the occasion of the 20 years of the creation of NIPC we would like to thank all&nbsp;
those who have contributed 

00:10:27.956 --> 00:10:32.377
to the preservation&nbsp;&nbsp;of Shri Mataji's legacy, 

00:10:32.377 --> 00:10:37.440
and particularly the team&nbsp;
in Austria who under the leadership of Ossi&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:46.160
created Devi Productions the ship many original&nbsp;
tapes from Italy to Austria, set up operations in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:54.800
Aussie and Susie's house, and started the process&nbsp;
of cleaning, digitizing, and editing Mother's&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:10:54.800 --> 00:11:04.480
talks. Over time, thousands of talks, audios, and&nbsp;
videos have been preserved and made available to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:11.600
the public. Today, almost 20 years after the&nbsp;
initial setup, the work of Devi Productions&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:11.600 --> 00:11:19.840
is still going on. Unfortunately, our dear brother&nbsp;
Ossi passed away, but the new team is active as&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:28.400
ever in continuing this wonderful work. We are&nbsp;
also remembering our dear brother Wolfgang who&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:34.880
has always been a very strong supporter of Devi&nbsp;
Productions work and was always ready to find new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:41.200
ways to help them. We are Devi Production.&nbsp;
We are the team here, the new current team in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:47.760
in Vienna, Austria. I'm Ben. I've been doing&nbsp;
the videos uh the digitizations and producing the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:53.840
video content. I'm Anton. I'm the audio guy in the&nbsp;
team and I'm taking care of all the audio tapes.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.440
Audio tapes digitization and optimization of the&nbsp;
audio material. Hello, I'm Madu. I'm doing the IT&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:04.880
department in the Devi Production. Taking care&nbsp;
of the workstations and the servers so that all&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:09.564
the work that has been digitized remains in the&nbsp;
archive and everything works as it should. 

00:12:09.829 --> 00:12:19.833
My name&nbsp;is Eric. I'm from Switzerland and I'm working for&nbsp;
Nirmala Vidya. Nirmala Vidya was created by NIPC in 2011.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:27.520
to pursue the mission of preserving&nbsp;
and distributing and protecting all the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:34.880
recordings of Shri Mataji and enhance and&nbsp;
make it available for the collectivity to use&nbsp;it&nbsp;

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:42.640
What I just want to share is that first&nbsp;
it was a great privilege to be in this project&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:50.480
this amazing project which is there for the future&nbsp;
generation and hopefully for the eternity and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.160
but the thing is I was hired as a project manager&nbsp;
and you know how it is in the professional world&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:12:56.160 --> 00:13:04.480
we plan we organize all what is what Shri Mataji&nbsp;
laughed about it actually and that was really the&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:04.480 --> 00:13:10.240
what I learned there is that in Sahaj when you have&nbsp;
projects uh you just have to have the desire and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:17.120
the rest is all done by the Divine by the Adi Shakti&nbsp;
like Shri Mataji explained in Delhi She build the house&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.960
not just putting all the ingredients together so&nbsp;
it's the same it was really the same was slowly&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.800
putting all the ingredients the right people for&nbsp;
the right experience with the right knowledge and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:28.800 --> 00:13:37.520
the right attitude and slowly brought us till&nbsp;
today where as you know we have Amuta,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:37.520 --> 00:13:44.720
we have the App where we can connect every day&nbsp;
with Shri Mataji through a speech, through videos,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:50.960
but also the production of the book with the Nirmala Vidya Collection Team, the amazing work that&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:56.960
has been done to preserve all this content.&nbsp;
So it's a beautiful journey and it's not&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:13:56.960 --> 00:14:03.280
finished because the challenge are big now is to&nbsp;
how to make use of all this knowledge to make it&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:10.240
available also for the seekers properly to use&nbsp;
it properly to use the image properly in most&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:17.840
respectous way and manner and that's&nbsp;
the challenge also with the advent of AI and&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:23.360
uh that's the job is never ending I would say&nbsp;
and it's not a job actually it's just a blessing&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:30.800
to be that to be participating to that&nbsp;
project and uh I hope I just can stay in&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:36.175
the flow of what Mother wants to to be done&nbsp;
from us. 

00:14:36.175 --> 00:14:46.000
Hello everyone, my name is Wadi and&nbsp;I've been helping the project since 2013 with&nbsp;
the mobile apps. Hello, my name is Daher. I have&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:52.320
been helping the project since my brother Wy joins&nbsp;
to it. I always try to give a hand and try to do&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:14:52.320 --> 00:15:00.560
whatever is possible. Since 2018, I begin to work&nbsp;
full-time maintaining the apps and creating new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:00.560 --> 00:15:08.560
features like song book, mantra book and also I&nbsp;
joined to work with Radoslaw from Poland and we try to&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:16.960
keep all the content on Nirmala Vidya apps and Amruta&nbsp;
website updated and we are working on a brand new&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:24.294
version of the mobile apps okay with a&nbsp;
new design and new features. So please stay&nbsp;&nbsp;tuned.

00:15:24.294 --> 00:15:31.200
With regards to the future. AI artificial&nbsp;
intelligence is already playing a significant&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:39.200
role and our Sahaja teams are actively exploring&nbsp;
its potential. Unfortunately the other side of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:48.400
the coin exists AI artificial insanity where&nbsp;
deep fake videos of Mother are a big concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:57.920
We urge yogis to stay alert to such mis misuse&nbsp;
and also to those who are monetizing sahaja yoga.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:15:57.920 --> 00:16:07.680
We humbly ask yogis only to use the NIPC platforms&nbsp;
and the Nirmala Vidya app as they provide authentic&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:07.680 --> 00:16:16.880
unaltered teachings of Shri Mataji. Unlike platforms&nbsp;
such as YouTube which may contain edited content&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:16.880 --> 00:16:26.880
and disruptive adverts. NIPC preserves the purity&nbsp;
and integrity of Shri Mataji's original messages&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:38.640
making it the only reliable source. Nirmal&nbsp;
Vidya the spoken and written words of Shri Adi Shakti

00:16:38.640 --> 00:16:43.600
is the ultimate template for the&nbsp;
emancipation and salvation of all of&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:54.080
humanity to our evolution to our upliftment&nbsp;
to all the solutions of our problems.

00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:04.240
It's the gateway to Her holy lotus&nbsp;
feet. It's the highway to heaven.

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:09.760
It's the key to that golden gate and&nbsp;
it's the meeting place of our Sahasrara&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:16.000
with that of the Sahasrara of the Virat. We don't&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:26.240
have the the words the vocabulary to&nbsp;
