00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.100
Hitler came because he hated human beings.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:15.183
He was a satanic force who incarnated

00:00:15.263 --> 00:00:18.684
and did all kinds of horrible things.

00:00:18.764 --> 00:00:21.017
The way he has killed people,

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:25.051
you can't imagine a human being can do that.

00:00:26.222 --> 00:00:28.690
He killed children.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.934
He killed grown-up people in the gas chambers and

00:00:34.014 --> 00:00:36.934
- such a horrible thing.

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:40.392
When I went to Germany, they wanted Me to see all that.

00:00:40.472 --> 00:00:45.347
I said, "I can't see. I will not be able to see it."

00:00:46.097 --> 00:00:48.851
But My husband went there

00:00:48.931 --> 00:00:52.639
and when he came back, he was sick for seven days.

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:55.100
It's so sickening.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.472
It's so inhuman to behave like that,

00:00:59.138 --> 00:01:02.388
to kill people, under some circumstances,

00:01:02.931 --> 00:01:06.555
under certain conceptions and wrong ideas.

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:12.058
I don't know what sort of idea this Hitler had

00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:16.222
that he got after the Jews and started killing them.

00:01:18.639 --> 00:01:22.182
All kinds of things have happened on this Earth,

00:01:22.263 --> 00:01:26.349
all in the name of religion. This is the worst part of it.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.434
Throughout, people have been killing

00:01:29.514 --> 00:01:31.558
in the name of religion.

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:34.474
Religion teaches you to love,

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:37.516
to love God and love each other.

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:42.197
How can it teach you to hate and to kill?

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.558
I mean, it's very surprising, still going on.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.267
This kind of a nonsense is still going on.

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:52.014
It's only Sahaja Yoga that can stop this nonsense

00:01:53.764 --> 00:01:57.267
and it should because, after all,

00:01:57.347 --> 00:01:59.683
we are all human beings.

00:01:59.764 --> 00:02:02.517
For that, you have to have your resurrection,

00:02:02.597 --> 00:02:04.725
as Christ had.

00:02:04.806 --> 00:02:09.141
And this resurrection is possible on this Earth,

00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:11.891
very easily now with Sahaja Yoga.

00:02:11.972 --> 00:02:15.725
Muhammad-sahib has called it has miraj.

00:02:15.806 --> 00:02:19.516
He's described it very well, very clearly.

00:02:19.597 --> 00:02:22.051
But who wants that?

00:02:22.347 --> 00:02:24.891
They don't want to have their miraj.

00:02:24.972 --> 00:02:27.142
If somebody tries to work it out,

00:02:27.222 --> 00:02:30.183
they get after that person, saying

00:02:30.263 --> 00:02:33.610
that "This is something ridiculous."

00:02:34.222 --> 00:02:36.266
It's all wrong.

00:02:36.347 --> 00:02:41.641
I mean this has happened with all of them.

00:02:41.722 --> 00:02:43.809
All of them have suffered

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.965
because of the ignorance of human beings - all of them.

00:02:48.597 --> 00:02:54.347
And also with Me, they are criticizing and this and that.

00:02:55.305 --> 00:02:58.350
But I am much more powerful,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.388
because love is much more powerful than anything else.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.851
And it's working out all over the world now,

00:03:04.931 --> 00:03:09.559
everywhere people are realizing that this kind of a hatred,

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:14.266
this kind of a wrong idea about others

00:03:14.347 --> 00:03:18.224
is absolutely dangerous.

00:03:18.305 --> 00:03:25.138
And so, once large number of people know this,

00:03:25.222 --> 00:03:28.199
I'm sure it will all finish off.

00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:34.599
We have lots of incidents like that, even recently.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.142
That just because you follow a particular religion,

00:03:38.222 --> 00:03:40.182
people hate you.

00:03:40.263 --> 00:03:43.111
I mean I can't understand.

00:03:44.014 --> 00:03:46.889
You cannot explain why, why it is done,

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:52.433
but it's done and very wrong to hate any human being

00:03:52.514 --> 00:03:57.142
in the name of God, who has created you.

00:03:57.222 --> 00:04:01.109
They don't understand God and His love.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.934
For example, Christ's life - just see it.

00:04:08.014 --> 00:04:10.809
He was hardly thirty-three years of age

00:04:10.889 --> 00:04:14.388
when He was crucified.

00:04:16.138 --> 00:04:19.569
His mother had to suffer so much.

00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:23.891
Why? Why did they crucify Him?

00:04:23.972 --> 00:04:27.641
Because He was teaching about love.

00:04:27.722 --> 00:04:32.656
None of them liked this idea of loving each other.

00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:36.692
How can you help people if you don't love?

00:04:37.388 --> 00:04:43.850
Under what premises do you help others?

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:46.599
Because you love,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:50.142
that's why you want to enjoy others

00:04:50.222 --> 00:04:51.806
and to understand.

00:04:51.847 --> 00:04:54.726
Once you start loving others,

00:04:54.806 --> 00:05:00.048
then this myth finishes off.

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:02.851
Supposing you are born as a Christian

00:05:02.931 --> 00:05:06.188
or a Muslim or a Hindu, or whatever it is,

00:05:07.847 --> 00:05:13.219
what makes you think that you are different from others?

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:16.558
You are born the same way.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:19.891
You are conceived by your mother the same way.

00:05:19.972 --> 00:05:22.141
You look the same way.

00:05:22.222 --> 00:05:25.975
Your nose, eyes, everything is the same.

00:05:26.056 --> 00:05:29.141
What makes you different?

00:05:29.222 --> 00:05:32.722
I think it's something political about it,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:35.808
something very mean

00:05:35.889 --> 00:05:40.849
to separate people in the name of God and religion.

00:05:41.388 --> 00:05:43.767
On the contrary, Sahaja Yoga is to

00:05:43.847 --> 00:05:47.405
unite all the people in the name of God,

00:05:48.014 --> 00:05:51.558
to make them one in the name of God.

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.641
Supposing there is somebody living,

00:05:54.722 --> 00:05:57.347
say, in South Africa

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.308
or say, in a far-fetched place like Benin and all that

00:06:03.388 --> 00:06:05.350
- has become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:09.308
There are thousands who have become Sahaja Yogis there.

00:06:09.388 --> 00:06:12.266
They are all your bothers and sisters.

00:06:12.347 --> 00:06:14.182
They're your own.

00:06:14.263 --> 00:06:16.934
You go there and they will

00:06:17.014 --> 00:06:22.200
treat you just like their own children, their own relations.

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:25.976
They will never think what religion you come from

00:06:26.056 --> 00:06:29.266
or what sect you come from, nothing.

00:06:29.347 --> 00:06:32.725
I was surprised the way they have love.

00:06:32.806 --> 00:06:37.154
Actually, loving is an innate quality of human beings.

00:06:37.472 --> 00:06:41.058
It's an innate quality. Every human being has been

00:06:41.138 --> 00:06:44.972
given this treasure of loving, loving capacity.
