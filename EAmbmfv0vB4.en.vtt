00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.700
If you discover your inner energy  you will also discover yourself.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.020
You will become a very good, peaceful person.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.400
You will not suffer.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.160
Shri Mataji is an Indian yoga master.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.400
Millions of people deem Her holy.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.000
Among those millions are Americans, English and also Turkish.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.880
Shri Mataji, staying is Swiss Otel, came to the hotel just when it had been seized by Chechen terrorists.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.000
Just at the first minutes of the siege.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.180
Two bullets hit our door.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:33.840
We were not worried.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.200
I new that this action would not last long because it was stupid.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.760
All night we were listening to the music and watching TV.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.880
In any case, nothing happened.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.020
Mataji explains the siege as an ordinary event without any excitement.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.000
But a little later we understand that this is Mataji's normal state.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.340
Mataji always speaks as if She has departed from the worldly troubles and has passed to a different dimension.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.200
Maybe this is what influences those who meet Her.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:10.240
With this thought in mind we ask Mataji what does yoga give to the people.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.200
Love, pure love.The secret is just love.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.800
When we told Her that the approach to yoga in Turkey is somehow like a kind of fashion,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.780
a light smile appears on Her face.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.080
The aim of yoga is to beatify your spirit, not your body.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.400
"Fashion comes and goes but yoga beatifies your spirit and does not take any money."

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.200
According to Her love is the key to everything.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.180
Well, what is Her approach to love?

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.000
Did you ever fall in love?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
No, I am not that kind, I am not romantic.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.500
Because, if you run just after one person you will restrict yourself.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.600
But if you love the whole world, you will never be disappointed.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.200
Mataji explains how much She loves Turkey and Turks.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.600
But, according to Her Turkey has one problem - men.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.360
If you women come forward your problems will be solved easier.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.040
Men consider themselves too clever but one can say they are successful.

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.960
According to Shri Mataji, there is one more problem in Turkey -

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.020
"You don't know how to make business,

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.200
also you don't know how to use money properly.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.000
When such a person of love speaks about money it sounds quite surprising.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.600
And we ask Mataji how does she earn money, how does She spend it?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.400
My husband has always had money, my children too.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.000
We did not have this kind of difficulty.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.800
Mataji says that She does not need money.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.200
That is why, like in all other places,

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.000
She does not take money for Her seminars in Turkey.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.300
Now the turn comes to us to get our realization.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.000
That is to discover our inner energy.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.300
Mataji is working quite long on us.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.500
The energy we take from Her is very positive.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.700
Is it because we really feel lighter or because of Mataji's influence, we don't know.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.000
But we depart from this interesting lady with a smile on our faces.
