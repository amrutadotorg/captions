00:00:02.205 --> 00:00:03.956
Yesterday,

00:00:04.603 --> 00:00:09.277
we saw the beautiful drama of Shri Rama.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:12.542
It was done so beautifully

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:18.212
that my heart was filled with admiration.

00:00:19.006 --> 00:00:21.271
I couldn't say anything

00:00:22.326 --> 00:00:26.872
Is a very good work,

00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:29.704
and that's what happens to you

00:00:29.886 --> 00:00:34.813
when you become the spirit, you become creative.
You have to be creators.

00:00:35.237 --> 00:00:39.881
You create Sahaja Yogis, 
you create all kinds of beautiful things.

00:00:40.164 --> 00:00:46.874
And this was so much, so much done in the name of Self.

00:00:47.532 --> 00:00:50.489
I'm very happy they have made this drama,

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:52.902
And I'll organize somehow

00:00:53.058 --> 00:00:57.386
that it goes to India and to America as well.
Is very well done.

00:00:57.652 --> 00:01:00.269
So, give them a hand...

00:01:16.916 --> 00:01:21.199
Also, I very much admire

00:01:21.392 --> 00:01:24.859
the work put in by the Italian Sahaja Yogis

00:01:25.488 --> 00:01:33.558
and others who have been of help to him, to Mr. Guido

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:35.802
and also to others

00:01:36.018 --> 00:01:42.421
that they have created 
such a tremendous effect in this

00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:45.869
enorm big

00:01:48.546 --> 00:01:55.763
structure, that I used to think
how can it be a puja in such a structure

00:01:56.537 --> 00:02:04.686
But it has been now become so beautiful and so nice
that I really thank the Italians for that.

00:02:05.117 --> 00:02:09.491
One thing about Italians is, they are very large hearted people.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.593
And I wish all of you develope
that large heartedness and work out evereything

00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:22.827
to enjoy your large heartedness.
Thank you.
