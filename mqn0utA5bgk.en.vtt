00:00:00.004 --> 00:00:04.300
Puja Talk, India Tour. Ganapatipule (India), 6 January 1988.

00:05:45.977 --> 00:05:56.083
It is said that God is Satchitanand.

00:05:56.283 --> 00:06:03.268
He is truth, He is attention and He is joy.

00:06:08.872 --> 00:06:19.948
In Sahaja Yoga, first you have discovered the truth.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:27.697
You discovered the truth on your fingertips.

00:06:27.897 --> 00:06:30.800
The truth that you can discover

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:35.693
on your central nervous system is the truth.

00:06:35.893 --> 00:06:40.971
First you discover the truth and you can tell about it,

00:06:41.171 --> 00:06:45.777
talk about, explain about it

00:06:45.977 --> 00:06:49.111
but you cannot give it to others

00:06:49.311 --> 00:06:54.486
unless and until the other person gets Realization.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:00.200
So the truth has to be tested.

00:07:02.509 --> 00:07:11.485
One has to test on the fingertips the existence of truth.

00:07:17.147 --> 00:07:23.528
Otherwise all kinds of descriptions are of no avail.

00:07:24.734 --> 00:07:28.402
No one can understand what you are talking about

00:07:28.602 --> 00:07:32.553
when you tell them that you can feel the all pervading power

00:07:32.753 --> 00:07:36.649
of Gods' love around you.

00:07:40.624 --> 00:07:51.309
And then you start experiencing your attention.

00:07:57.074 --> 00:08:06.889
You start feeling that

00:08:07.089 --> 00:08:12.849
there is somebody, some force, some power,

00:08:13.049 --> 00:08:17.768
some organization is looking after you.

00:08:22.245 --> 00:08:30.242
Gradually you find your own attention becomes active.

00:08:33.536 --> 00:08:36.375
Today I am happy to say that

00:08:36.575 --> 00:08:40.929
I can tell you all these things openly, so clearly.

00:08:41.129 --> 00:08:48.006
But can you believe that 20 years back even in India

00:08:48.206 --> 00:08:53.664
nobody could talk about it

00:08:53.864 --> 00:08:57.413
because something Agamya, not to be known,

00:08:57.613 --> 00:09:00.365
not to be understood.

00:09:00.565 --> 00:09:05.589
Because your attention has become enlightened,

00:09:06.303 --> 00:09:10.962
with your enlightened attention you are listening to Me

00:09:11.162 --> 00:09:16.002
that's why you are understand what I am saying.

00:09:16.202 --> 00:09:20.952
You attention itself has become active now.

00:09:22.921 --> 00:09:25.921
And it baffles you sometimes when you see

00:09:26.778 --> 00:09:31.208
how many powers you have got.

00:09:31.408 --> 00:09:34.287
So through your Kundalini awakening

00:09:34.487 --> 00:09:44.174
your attention has got a subtler dimension

00:09:44.374 --> 00:09:49.159
which gives you an active attention.

00:09:50.794 --> 00:09:57.278
Before this you use to play into the hands of your attention.

00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:02.318
Anything happen you would turn your head to that,

00:10:02.518 --> 00:10:08.437
anything that would be called as some sort of an event

00:10:08.637 --> 00:10:12.133
or something attractive you

00:10:12.333 --> 00:10:16.315
you would be putting your attention to that.

00:10:16.515 --> 00:10:24.369
Your attention would go to things which were controlling you as if,

00:10:24.569 --> 00:10:28.139
as if they were in charge of you.

00:10:28.339 --> 00:10:32.040
But after getting Realization

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:38.113
your attention itself is under your own power and it
acts.

00:10:40.983 --> 00:10:47.228
First in India we had a foreign rule

00:10:47.428 --> 00:10:49.809
so we had to act according to

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:53.837
the wish of the foreign rulers.

00:10:54.038 --> 00:10:59.251
So we thought it is better to have independence,

00:10:59.451 --> 00:11:04.596
to have our own rulers.

00:11:06.191 --> 00:11:10.721
So we achieved the freedom politically

00:11:10.921 --> 00:11:16.166
we have our own rulers who will rule us

00:11:16.366 --> 00:11:19.245
according to our own wish

00:11:19.445 --> 00:11:24.892
and we won't be enslaved by others' wishes.

00:11:27.004 --> 00:11:30.812
But this is not freedom at all

00:11:31.012 --> 00:11:35.684
because your attention is still in bondage.

00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:40.960
It has got the shackles

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.608
of all kinds of nonsensical things upon it.

00:11:45.808 --> 00:11:51.165
It shifts all the time to wrong things.

00:11:52.555 --> 00:12:01.967
But after Realization attention becomes Nirmal, free,

00:12:02.167 --> 00:12:06.781
Samarthiya, powerful

00:12:06.981 --> 00:12:12.305
it acts because it is completely free now.

00:12:12.506 --> 00:12:15.182
Unless and until you are completely free

00:12:15.383 --> 00:12:19.823
you cannot act.

00:12:20.024 --> 00:12:23.453
This is the greatest blessing of Sahaja Yoga

00:12:23.653 --> 00:12:27.771
that your attention has become so free.

00:12:27.971 --> 00:12:36.461
It acts the way you wanted to act and it communicates.

00:12:38.873 --> 00:12:42.596
It communicates to you.

00:12:43.484 --> 00:12:49.070
The real communication starts. One
day a gentleman who are given,

00:12:49.270 --> 00:12:52.024
whom I have given Realization for the first time,

00:12:52.224 --> 00:12:56.094
he got Realization, he was the first one to get it.

00:12:56.294 --> 00:12:59.983
And he went into his congregation

00:13:00.183 --> 00:13:03.745
where he felt that there is somebody else who is a Realized soul.

00:13:03.945 --> 00:13:07.606
So he looked around and he saw a lady sitting there

00:13:07.806 --> 00:13:12.076
who had Realization. He came and asked Me, Mother

00:13:12.292 --> 00:13:17.033
did you give Realization to such and such lady. I said I did.

00:13:19.477 --> 00:13:23.539
So this communication between the reality and yourself

00:13:23.739 --> 00:13:26.238
is established through attention

00:13:26.438 --> 00:13:32.120
because in the attention now there is freedom to know.

00:13:33.035 --> 00:13:35.089
But in the attention now

00:13:35.289 --> 00:13:38.922
we have to see that there are so many other things

00:13:39.122 --> 00:13:46.873
which have clouded the awareness of the attention.

00:13:47.913 --> 00:13:55.705
This cloudedness comes with our conditioning and our ego.

00:13:56.713 --> 00:14:00.338
And this conditioning can be very, very strong.

00:14:00.538 --> 00:14:04.426
I would say in India, we are over conditioned people

00:14:04.626 --> 00:14:07.594
because we are traditionally made.

00:14:07.795 --> 00:14:10.553
And we do not see what is good in tradition

00:14:10.753 --> 00:14:14.082
and what is bad in tradition. Whatever good we have to keep

00:14:14.282 --> 00:14:16.296
and whatever bad we have to throw away.

00:14:16.496 --> 00:14:25.651
Whatever is the tradition is the
best is absolutely a wrong idea.

00:14:27.882 --> 00:14:31.915
So such an attention which is so much bogged

00:14:32.115 --> 00:14:37.194
or you can say completely covered with conditioning

00:14:37.394 --> 00:14:42.188
can not communicate with reality.

00:14:46.195 --> 00:14:53.858
Though reality is anxious to communicate and to say

00:14:54.058 --> 00:15:02.348
or to inform whatever is desires of the Divine

00:15:02.549 --> 00:15:08.606
but, as we are so much loaded with our conditioning

00:15:08.806 --> 00:15:13.203
that it can not communicate.

00:15:13.822 --> 00:15:15.942
You are frightened of the society,

00:15:16.142 --> 00:15:18.227
you are frightened of the surroundings,

00:15:18.427 --> 00:15:20.856
frightened of our relations, who are no more our relations

00:15:21.056 --> 00:15:23.154
at all, nothing to do with because they have

00:15:23.354 --> 00:15:26.439
no communication with the reality.

00:15:26.639 --> 00:15:29.893
We are the ones who have got now

00:15:30.094 --> 00:15:34.184
communication with reality.

00:15:34.385 --> 00:15:37.139
When the ego part, our futuristic ideas w

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:39.722
e want to develop this, we want to do that

00:15:39.722 --> 00:15:43.464
we want to achieve this.

00:15:45.979 --> 00:15:50.493
That also dulls our attention

00:15:50.693 --> 00:15:57.592
and puts it into the shackles of ego
which are even worse I would say.

00:15:57.792 --> 00:16:01.284
At least the first one...

00:16:52.382 --> 00:16:57.707
Some children have beautiful attention and some don't have.

00:16:57.907 --> 00:17:00.755
I would not always blame the parents but of course partly

00:17:00.955 --> 00:17:02.955
they are responsible.

00:17:03.156 --> 00:17:05.156
At this stage if their attention is not good,

00:17:05.357 --> 00:17:08.500
at what age they are going to improve? Parents pamper them,

00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:13.343
spoil them then the children cant' have good attention.

00:17:16.214 --> 00:17:20.283
Those who are half hearted Sahaja Yogis

00:17:20.483 --> 00:17:25.810
are still sitting on the edges.

00:17:27.223 --> 00:17:32.969
And can be anytime brought into the sea of illusion.

00:17:34.136 --> 00:17:38.518
You have to be perfect Sahaja Yogis.

00:17:40.090 --> 00:17:43.818
Some people find it easy, escape it by saying that

00:17:44.017 --> 00:17:47.707
such and such person is much better than me.

00:17:47.908 --> 00:17:51.002
And then too sat back and saying that "oh, I am not good".

00:17:51.202 --> 00:17:54.789
So you better get out.

00:17:58.556 --> 00:18:05.339
Here the Divine needs the people who will do the job of the Divine.

00:18:07.703 --> 00:18:09.909
But even if you ask them to get out

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.981
they'll stick on and stick on and stick on.

00:18:14.182 --> 00:18:18.045
It's not going to help them because they think it is blissful,

00:18:18.245 --> 00:18:23.135
may be some of them think that they
can have some material advantage.

00:18:23.335 --> 00:18:28.287
Some of them think they can get some presents in Ganapatipulle.

00:18:29.057 --> 00:18:34.179
Very low grade understanding.

00:18:36.727 --> 00:18:42.982
So such people are bothering us and are good for nothing.

00:18:43.182 --> 00:18:48.762
The first and foremost thing is to clear your heart.

00:18:49.801 --> 00:18:54.382
I have seen that the relationships

00:18:54.582 --> 00:19:00.471
is the greatest curse on Indians.

00:19:01.428 --> 00:19:08.626
And the second is the caste system.

00:19:09.968 --> 00:19:17.107
I know of a lady who is absolutely no good for Sahaja Yog

00:19:17.307 --> 00:19:21.190
but her sisters are supporting her.

00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:23.779
I know all that and as a result

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:26.363
they are losing themselves in Sahaja Yoga

00:19:26.564 --> 00:19:30.874
and the brother in law has become suddenly hot tempered.

00:19:31.075 --> 00:19:33.288
But if I tell them they won't listen

00:19:33.488 --> 00:19:35.861
till they are completely finished, all of them

00:19:35.861 --> 00:19:39.647
this lady will stick on.

00:19:41.830 --> 00:19:44.820
Unless and until this lady clears her heart

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:50.770
she should not come to Sahaja Yoga and oblige all the relations.

00:19:51.706 --> 00:19:55.578
This kind of low graded understanding of Sahaja Yoga

00:19:55.778 --> 00:20:03.722
will lead you no where and how many of
you are going to drop out I don't know.

00:20:08.556 --> 00:20:10.685
You wouldn't even know when you are catching

00:20:10.885 --> 00:20:15.758
and what's happening if you keep to these relationships.

00:20:16.933 --> 00:20:20.697
Another, is another myth of a caste system in this country,

00:20:20.897 --> 00:20:23.713
which is the greatest cancer, you could think of,

00:20:23.913 --> 00:20:28.032
for such a Divine country like this.

00:20:29.223 --> 00:20:33.785
It's the greatest curse

00:20:33.985 --> 00:20:37.333
but in the West we have another curses

00:20:37.533 --> 00:20:41.382
though you have got rid of all these past thing

00:20:41.582 --> 00:20:44.985
you have modern curses.

00:20:45.185 --> 00:20:48.517
And the modern curses are even worse in a way

00:20:48.717 --> 00:20:51.495
because they are not troublesome at all.

00:20:51.695 --> 00:20:56.342
On the contrary they show as if

00:20:56.542 --> 00:21:01.801
you are on top of the world that you are very successful.

00:21:05.484 --> 00:21:12.036
In the modern curses the thing is the attitude "what's wrong?".

00:21:15.092 --> 00:21:21.830
They linger on this idea to great extent,

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:24.933
"what's wrong?".

00:21:25.133 --> 00:21:29.142
You have to be selfish about it.

00:21:29.342 --> 00:21:33.428
You have to think about yourself

00:21:33.628 --> 00:21:37.579
and not about others and about your society,

00:21:37.779 --> 00:21:47.148
about your development, you're so-called industrial revolution.

00:21:47.807 --> 00:21:49.788
It has already cursed you.

00:21:49.988 --> 00:21:52.075
Industrial revolution has already cursed you.

00:21:52.275 --> 00:21:55.644
You are eating the food from tins.

00:21:55.844 --> 00:22:00.400
You are having hybrid animals to give you milk,

00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:04.949
tomorrow you will have mothers who are hybrid.

00:22:07.957 --> 00:22:11.858
You are having divorces, you are having drugs,

00:22:12.058 --> 00:22:15.787
all kinds of things that are curse on human beings

00:22:15.987 --> 00:22:21.090
are worked out through this modern conditioning in you.

00:22:24.678 --> 00:22:27.422
To make this attention clean

00:22:27.622 --> 00:22:32.340
should be the only effort of a Sahaja Yogi.

00:22:32.541 --> 00:22:34.593
Sahaja Yogi is not a pass time,

00:22:34.794 --> 00:22:36.958
for many it's is just a pass time.

00:22:37.159 --> 00:22:39.674
Their jobs, their businesses is most important.

00:22:39.874 --> 00:22:43.007
Sahaja Yoga is just a pass time.

00:22:43.208 --> 00:22:47.045
They are all right for a time being. How long will they go on?

00:22:47.245 --> 00:22:49.950
I can't say.

00:22:50.150 --> 00:22:55.890
So clear your attention first then everything is going to work out.

00:22:56.090 --> 00:22:59.081
But see that in your attention you pay importance to things,

00:22:59.281 --> 00:23:03.133
which are no important at all.

00:23:04.679 --> 00:23:10.661
In this respect I would say you have to be individual,

00:23:10.863 --> 00:23:13.389
to know that your attention has to be clean.

00:23:13.589 --> 00:23:17.521
Where is my attention going?

00:23:19.045 --> 00:23:25.466
Clubbing is the worst curse that
we have in Western Countries.

00:23:25.666 --> 00:23:28.587
They will club under any name. Supposing

00:23:28.587 --> 00:23:33.666
there is a red hair people, they will form a red hair league.

00:23:39.903 --> 00:23:42.784
In that way I would say

00:23:42.784 --> 00:23:45.811
people are least individualistic.

00:23:46.012 --> 00:23:48.389
Whatever they may say that they are democratic

00:23:48.589 --> 00:23:51.548
I would say they are least individualistic.

00:23:51.748 --> 00:23:57.798
If a lady starts a kind of a hairstyle

00:23:57.998 --> 00:24:03.029
all the ladies do the same, just like donkeys.

00:24:03.670 --> 00:24:06.495
If the men do not put oil in their hair

00:24:06.696 --> 00:24:09.550
all the men will not put oil in theirs'.

00:24:09.750 --> 00:24:12.234
I don't know what looks nice without the... dishevelled hair

00:24:12.441 --> 00:24:15.074
I just don't understand. That's the fashion now,

00:24:15.274 --> 00:24:19.061
nobody will put any oil in their hair.

00:24:19.262 --> 00:24:23.337
Even if you can wash it off they will not put it.

00:24:24.893 --> 00:24:30.799
This is such a simple thing

00:24:30.999 --> 00:24:35.697
that you need oil for your hair.

00:24:37.777 --> 00:24:45.512
But all these modern ideas are anti life.

00:24:52.779 --> 00:24:57.373
They are teaching you something which will make you bald.

00:24:57.573 --> 00:25:02.472
Sometimes you lose your ears or nose or whatever it is.

00:25:03.472 --> 00:25:06.129
To put that in the ears all the time and

00:25:06.329 --> 00:25:09.984
listen to that music all the time and going on the streets,

00:25:10.184 --> 00:25:16.103
on those wheels, I mean it's really madness I think,

00:25:16.303 --> 00:25:19.875
stupidity, absolutely.

00:25:20.075 --> 00:25:24.361
But regarded as something very modern.

00:25:24.988 --> 00:25:28.360
It's all anti life activities going on.

00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:35.256
Putting color on the hair, red, yellow, green,

00:25:35.637 --> 00:25:38.921
wearing no clothes when it's so very cold,

00:25:39.121 --> 00:25:45.277
sitting in the sun burning your skin,

00:25:47.332 --> 00:25:54.340
to behave indecently, decorously, that is to be modern.

00:25:54.540 --> 00:25:57.570
"What's wrong?"

00:25:57.770 --> 00:26:03.868
Nothing is wrong, just to go to hell, that's all.

00:26:04.068 --> 00:26:09.534
If that means nothing, take two running jumps and go there

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:14.036
but leave Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:16.456 --> 00:26:19.968
Now the attention has to be cleared in a way that we meditate

00:26:19.968 --> 00:26:22.970
within ourselves and just go within yourself,

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.583
but see yourself what you are,

00:26:26.783 --> 00:26:32.783
how beautiful you are, how glorious you are, how subtle you are.

00:26:35.838 --> 00:26:39.144
But in stupid things they are individualistic,

00:26:39.344 --> 00:26:43.342
like "this is my carpet and this is my house,

00:26:43.542 --> 00:26:47.359
this is my furniture."

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.580
And they control others with that "this is my furniture,

00:26:50.780 --> 00:26:56.915
don't sit on that chair. Don't spoil my carpet".

00:26:57.391 --> 00:27:04.278
When you will die you won't be
buried with the carpet even.

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:13.293
Like in Egypt Pharaohs were buried with all their things you see.

00:27:13.493 --> 00:27:16.436
It is not possible these days because you don't have so much place

00:27:16.436 --> 00:27:20.168
to bury.

00:27:21.064 --> 00:27:23.110
So sticking on to nonsensical things

00:27:23.310 --> 00:27:28.356
and the important things not paying attention

00:27:28.556 --> 00:27:31.816
is an absolutely abuse of your attention

00:27:32.016 --> 00:27:34.673
and this has been achieved

00:27:34.873 --> 00:27:40.591
through your so called modern idea of individualism.

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:49.789
There is no integration of understanding

00:27:49.989 --> 00:27:57.862
and the whole thing is breaking into pieces.

00:28:00.332 --> 00:28:06.941
Between these two horrible extremes

00:28:07.141 --> 00:28:13.298
I have dared to start Sahaja Yoga,

00:28:13.498 --> 00:28:17.879
to collect you all there in the center.

00:28:19.601 --> 00:28:22.601
How?

00:28:23.658 --> 00:28:27.936
With very intense love.

00:28:30.698 --> 00:28:36.116
With very intense effort

00:28:36.316 --> 00:28:42.721
and a complete commitment that I am going to save this world.

00:28:51.746 --> 00:28:54.540
It has worked so well now,

00:28:54.740 --> 00:29:03.819
I can see you all get into the third stage of joy.

00:29:06.169 --> 00:29:11.588
And the joy is what I want you to have

00:29:11.788 --> 00:29:18.514
and not self-destruction or stupid conditioning pressures.

00:29:18.714 --> 00:29:21.450
Joy

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:27.906
and joy has no double meaning it's absolute.

00:29:30.129 --> 00:29:33.436
You reach to that subtlety that you start enjoying

00:29:33.636 --> 00:29:39.428
the tasting of joy, not vibration but joy,

00:29:41.658 --> 00:29:44.855
beyond your central nervous system

00:29:45.055 --> 00:29:49.540
where it can not be expressed in words.

00:29:50.699 --> 00:29:55.997
It expresses in your eyes, in your faces, in the atmosphere,

00:29:56.197 --> 00:29:59.974
in the nature, everywhere

00:30:00.174 --> 00:30:04.888
to see the whole thing is blossoming around.

00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:09.905
This is what you all have to achieve

00:30:10.105 --> 00:30:15.103
and for that we have to know

00:30:15.303 --> 00:30:21.117
that we are not going to bow down to anything

00:30:21.317 --> 00:30:26.333
that puts our attention into shackles.

00:30:26.804 --> 00:30:32.207
"Mother has freed us, let us spread our wings."

00:30:32.407 --> 00:30:35.714
"We are not little, small little birdies

00:30:35.914 --> 00:30:39.080
but now we have become birds

00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:48.409
and let us spread our wings and fly in the sky of joy".

00:30:54.068 --> 00:30:58.265
There is no need for birds to fly.

00:30:58.939 --> 00:31:01.644
They can sit at a place,

00:31:01.844 --> 00:31:05.557
of course, they cannot hire a bus,

00:31:05.757 --> 00:31:09.527
but they need not.

00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:19.240
They spread their wings and fly because they enjoy it,

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:27.178
like swimming in the sky of joy.

00:31:29.725 --> 00:31:36.113
So use the beauty of this joyous happening

00:31:36.313 --> 00:31:38.566
to nourish yourself,

00:31:38.766 --> 00:31:41.272
be happy,

00:31:41.472 --> 00:31:48.473
make everyone happy and emancipate this world from ignorance.

00:31:48.674 --> 00:31:52.013
May God bless you all.
