00:48.120 --> 00:58.120
First three minutes are without sound.

01:17.190 --> 01:27.190
The Left Side - Problems of the Subconscious

01:28.220 --> 01:38.220
May 13th, 1982, Christchurch Hove, Brighton, England

02:32.100 --> 02:34.120
Good conditionings.

02:36.010 --> 02:40.200
In the way, in the same way, you can have good habits

02:41.230 --> 02:45.170
and bad habits.

03:24.230 --> 03:26.140
If habits inhibit or

03:26.230 --> 03:29.010
obstruct your ascent,

03:31.210 --> 03:38.020
they also can help to stabilize you.

03:45.040 --> 03:49.040
The conditioning comes to you from the matter

03:49.150 --> 03:52.230
with which we are dealing every day.

03:53.230 --> 03:59.020
When a human being sees the matter, he aggressor it and

03:59.100 --> 04:04.010
he wants to use that matter for his own purpose.

04:04.100 --> 04:08.240
He changes the forms of the matter for his own purpose.

04:09.070 --> 04:12.210
He starts getting used to matter

04:14.040 --> 04:20.130
as comfort, or as a help or a guide in life.

04:21.210 --> 04:24.240
The more you start depending on matter,

04:25.060 --> 04:28.100
the more your spontaneity is finished,

04:28.180 --> 04:32.110
because you’re dealing with the dead.

04:35.000 --> 04:38.180
Matter, when it is dead, then only we deal with it.

04:39.010 --> 04:43.180
When it is living we are not so much bothered about it.

04:44.030 --> 04:49.000
So the deadness of that matter settles within us when

04:49.070 --> 04:54.240
we start using that matter for our purpose.

04:55.140 --> 04:58.170
But how are we to otherwise exist? Is the question

04:59.060 --> 05:02.050
people can ask. If God has given us this material things

05:02.160 --> 05:04.200
and this matter to be used,

05:05.050 --> 05:07.240
are we not supposed to use them?

05:08.100 --> 05:13.160
And are we not supposed to enjoy them?

05:13.230 --> 05:17.220
But we don’t enjoy. We …

05:18.140 --> 05:22.130
before Realization you cannot enjoy any matter.

05:22.230 --> 05:26.140
You can only form a habit and may become

05:26.210 --> 05:30.100
a slave of that matter, before Realization.

05:30.220 --> 05:35.180
It’s a principle of, fundamental principle of economics

05:36.000 --> 05:39.090
that wants in general are never satiable.

05:39.170 --> 05:42.190
Means today you want to buy something like a carpet.

05:43.010 --> 05:45.030
All right, you bought it.

05:45.180 --> 05:49.000
So now that carpet becames a headache, because it’s

05:49.000 --> 05:52.040
your possession, you have to look after it.

05:52.170 --> 05:55.140
You have to insure it, you have to worry about it that it

05:56.000 --> 05:59.040
doesn’t get spoiled, first of all.

05:59.180 --> 06:02.010
And secondly you really get

06:02.110 --> 06:06.020
into another mood of buying something else.

06:06.020 --> 06:08.180
Now you have bought the carpet, finished.

06:09.040 --> 06:10.120
Then you have to have something else, then you have to

06:10.210 --> 06:11.200
have something else,

06:12.030 --> 06:13.040
then you have to have something else.

06:13.150 --> 06:18.110
So it does not satiate you; it does not give you the joy.

06:20.180 --> 06:22.220
Matter can never give you joy.

06:23.050 --> 06:25.210
It’s the Spirit that gives you joy.

06:26.200 --> 06:28.190
And when the ascent takes place,

06:29.040 --> 06:33.130
when you become the Spirit, then matter takes another

06:33.240 --> 06:35.200
value system within ourselves,

06:36.040 --> 06:40.150
the value system of matter is very different.

06:41.040 --> 06:43.130
As I’m sure Jason must have told you that

06:43.240 --> 06:45.180
when you get your Realization,

06:46.150 --> 06:50.030
then you start feeling the Cool Breeze in the hand.

06:53.120 --> 06:55.040
In relationship to matter

06:55.170 --> 06:59.040
it’s very helpful to be a realized soul,

06:59.210 --> 07:04.020
because immediately you know

07:04.160 --> 07:08.020
what is good for you and what is bad for you.

07:08.100 --> 07:12.060
For example, you eat something that’s not good for you.

07:12.060 --> 07:14.000
Immediately you’ll lose your vibrations

07:14.110 --> 07:15.150
and will become hot.

07:16.020 --> 07:18.150
Even looking at it, it may happen.

07:19.010 --> 07:21.230
You want to sit on a chair on which somebody who is a

07:22.070 --> 07:24.170
very wrong type of a person has sat,

07:25.030 --> 07:26.230
immediately you’ll feel, “Oh, something wrong

07:27.060 --> 07:29.100
in this place.” With your vibrations,

07:29.200 --> 07:34.130
which is a definite thing, an absolute thing.

07:36.030 --> 07:39.060
And this conditioning can only be over –

07:39.060 --> 07:43.050
these habits can be overcome only if you become the Spirit,

07:43.190 --> 07:48.170
because Spirit is always dominated by the matter.

07:49.020 --> 07:52.000
And the Spirit has to overcome that domination of the matter.

07:54.230 --> 07:58.230
Actually, Spirit cannot be dominated by anything.

07:59.090 --> 08:02.240
But what I mean is that it is covered, like the sun can be

08:03.090 --> 08:06.240
covered with clouds.

08:06.240 --> 08:09.230
In the same way all our domination,

08:10.190 --> 08:17.110
or we can say all our enslavement of the matter,

08:17.110 --> 08:20.090
makes us dominate our Spirit in the sense that

08:20.230 --> 08:23.040
we cover it up. The clouds are there,

08:23.040 --> 08:25.000
we can’t see the Spirit. We can’t feel It.

08:25.130 --> 08:28.150
The spontaneity which is the beauty of the Spirit

08:28.220 --> 08:30.240
we do not feel, in a person.

08:31.090 --> 08:34.040
So, in judging a person, what do we judge?

08:34.140 --> 08:37.060
How that person looks, what dress he’s wearing,

08:37.180 --> 08:40.050
how he walks. What are his formal ways,

08:40.130 --> 08:42.160
does he know how to say “Thank you”, “Sorry” or not.

08:43.010 --> 08:45.070
You see? All these things impress us very much.

08:45.180 --> 08:49.200
What sort of a car he has, what sort of a house he has.

08:50.050 --> 08:56.200
Maybe we may miss, we may miss a saint.

08:57.100 --> 08:59.140
We may miss Christ again

08:59.230 --> 09:02.210
because He was a carpenter’s son.

09:03.070 --> 09:06.030
How are we to know who is Christ?

09:06.110 --> 09:11.110
Is there any way of finding out who is Christ?

09:11.190 --> 09:13.210
Many people are now talking “Christ is going to come,

09:14.090 --> 09:15.170
He’s going to come on the television.”

09:16.020 --> 09:19.140
You can put up anyone there as Christ.

09:19.220 --> 09:22.040
How are we going to make it out?

09:22.140 --> 09:25.060
By His dress or by some sort of a thing they have done?

09:25.150 --> 09:29.040
Most of the paintings of Christ and most of His statues

09:29.140 --> 09:31.230
that I’ve seen are no where near Christ,

09:32.080 --> 09:34.020
no where near Christ, you see.

09:34.120 --> 09:37.230
They are horrid things. I don’t know what are they.

09:38.070 --> 09:41.100
So how will you make it out that this is Christ or not?

09:41.190 --> 09:44.080
Or this is some sort of a hokus pokus fellow or some sort

09:44.180 --> 09:49.070
of a person who has come just deliberately to delude us

09:49.150 --> 09:51.210
from reality.

09:52.070 --> 09:55.180
There is no way out, to find out

09:57.020 --> 10:01.140
what is the truth because we are so much used to material

10:01.220 --> 10:03.040
forms that we have.

10:03.200 --> 10:08.200
For example, our idea of art also is in the same way

10:09.080 --> 10:11.110
molded.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.180
We like this kind of art.

10:14.030 --> 10:15.020
If you ask them, “Why?”

10:15.020 --> 10:18.150
“Because, you know, this has this kind of a thing

10:18.230 --> 10:20.060
– harmony” Or maybe,

10:20.170 --> 10:22.170
“this is more proportioned” and all that.

10:23.010 --> 10:26.030
But how do you know?”

10:26.130 --> 10:28.110
You know because you’ve read certain books or maybe

10:28.230 --> 10:34.190
that you have understood from somebody else

10:35.100 --> 10:38.150
that this is art, this is beautiful. I mean, you brand

10:39.000 --> 10:42.070
something as beautiful, but is it really?

10:42.190 --> 10:45.030
If it is beauty, it should be Spirit, because

10:45.160 --> 10:48.040
Spirit is beauty and beauty is Spirit.

10:48.140 --> 10:51.220
So is it, is it beauty? How do you make out

10:52.050 --> 10:55.130
that this art is beautiful or not?

10:55.130 --> 10:58.220
For example, according to all normal ideas of

10:59.040 --> 11:00.090
womanhood, I don’t think

11:00.210 --> 11:03.010
Mona Lisa is a beautiful woman.

11:03.130 --> 11:06.090
I mean, these days you see mosquito-like women are

11:06.170 --> 11:08.040
regarded as beautiful.

11:08.130 --> 11:10.150
So how they call Mona Lisa so beautiful?

11:11.030 --> 11:13.000
What’s going on?

11:13.100 --> 11:15.080
Thousands of people would be assembled to see that

11:15.190 --> 11:18.160
painting. Why? What is that?

11:19.000 --> 11:23.020
Only vibrations will tell you that it emits vibrations.

11:23.120 --> 11:25.120
It appeals to your Spirit without your knowledge.

11:25.220 --> 11:28.140
You’re not aware of it. It appeals to your Spirit.

11:28.230 --> 11:34.090
That’s why universally that painting is appreciated.

11:34.220 --> 11:37.180
But when this conditioning becomes collective,

11:38.020 --> 11:40.000
any such conditioning becomes collective and you

11:40.090 --> 11:45.010
accept, “This is the form that is beauty; this is the form

11:45.010 --> 11:50.120
that is reality; this is the form that is spontaneity”,

11:50.210 --> 11:53.190
then the confusion starts.

11:54.040 --> 11:56.170
The confusion starts at that point,

11:57.010 --> 11:59.130
when it becomes a collective thing.

12:00.090 --> 12:03.050
For example I met some people of some gurus.

12:04.000 --> 12:06.040
And I asked them,

12:06.040 --> 12:08.180
“What makes you think that your guru is truthful,

12:09.000 --> 12:10.030
what has he given you?

12:10.150 --> 12:12.240
He said, “because sitting in my chair I just start jumping

12:13.080 --> 12:18.100
by myself. I don’t do it but it happens, it’s spontaneous.”

12:19.100 --> 12:22.100
And in my presence, the way his body was moving was

12:22.190 --> 12:23.170
so horrifying.

12:24.060 --> 12:27.090
Anybody would have tremendous compassion

12:27.190 --> 12:29.020
and concern for such a person,

12:29.120 --> 12:31.110
that you can’t sit for five minutes straight …

12:31.110 --> 12:33.070
A woman in the audience says: Excuse me, it wasn’t

12:33.210 --> 12:35.080
spontaneous, it was nerve …

12:35.160 --> 12:37.080
Yes, that’s what I’m saying …

12:37.190 --> 12:39.230
Woman: You’re wrong in what You talk.

12:40.050 --> 12:41.060
What?

12:41.170 --> 12:42.220
Woman: About everything

12:42.220 --> 12:44.210
From where do you come?

12:45.060 --> 12:46.130
Woman: Up the road.

12:46.190 --> 12:48.110
That’s it. Better go.

12:49.030 --> 12:51.090
Woman: Don’t worry. I am.

12:51.200 --> 12:55.240
Look at that. She’ll go to the pub now.

12:59.010 --> 13:01.070
Must try to understand the subtleties, you see?

13:01.210 --> 13:03.080
If you are confirmed it what.

13:03.180 --> 13:07.010
Now supposing somebody starts jumping in the thing.

13:07.120 --> 13:09.200
As she says it’s true – nerves.

13:10.080 --> 13:14.030
That means you’re not in control of your nerves, isn’t it?

13:14.120 --> 13:16.240
Don’t you think so? You’re not in control.

13:17.070 --> 13:18.050
You have not controlled.

13:18.200 --> 13:21.160
Spontaneity is a thing which is not the thing that makes

13:22.020 --> 13:23.120
you a slave.

13:23.220 --> 13:25.090
This is the point I’m trying to bring.

13:25.180 --> 13:29.000
It doesn’t; it makes you a master.

13:29.080 --> 13:30.230
Spontaneity must make you a master

13:31.100 --> 13:33.150
and not a slave of anything.

13:34.000 --> 13:35.120
She must have come from TM because TM people

13:35.220 --> 13:38.110
jump like that.

13:38.210 --> 13:41.060
And they end up as epileptic people.

13:41.160 --> 13:42.200
I have cured so many of them.

13:43.040 --> 13:45.140
I don’t know if someone has come from there.

13:45.240 --> 13:51.140
Even the head of their academy in Scotland who –

13:51.220 --> 13:54.120
flying squad academy, as I call it,

13:55.120 --> 13:57.220
where people pay three thousand – now this gentleman

13:58.050 --> 14:01.020
sitting here is one of them who suffered.

14:01.090 --> 14:05.000
When they suffer then they know what it is.

14:05.090 --> 14:07.150
The other day we saw somebody with epilepsy of such

14:07.230 --> 14:10.210
frequency. The poor child, he was hardly twenty-six

14:12.100 --> 14:15.180
years of age, young man, supposed to enjoy his life,

14:16.050 --> 14:21.230
was going into such trauma, you can’t imagine.

14:22.230 --> 14:25.120
And if this is happening to somebody going to a guru,

14:25.200 --> 14:27.040
you paid for it,

14:27.170 --> 14:30.020
how can it be anywhere near Spirit?

14:30.100 --> 14:32.210
This is what I’m trying to tell you, that

14:33.060 --> 14:38.090
Spirit gives you spontaneity in which you are the master.

14:38.190 --> 14:43.090
You are the master of yourself, complete master,

14:43.180 --> 14:47.010
no enslavement of any kind, no habits formation coming.

14:47.110 --> 14:48.190
All habits drop out.

14:48.190 --> 14:51.230
You become so, so spontaneous that I don’t have to tell you.

14:52.070 --> 14:54.070
You just drop out all habits and you become a

14:54.150 --> 14:57.010
master of your self.

14:57.120 --> 14:59.160
That should happen to you.

15:00.010 --> 15:03.230
Instead of that, if you indulge into things which enslave

15:04.060 --> 15:07.010
you, you will like it for awhile

15:07.120 --> 15:08.230
because you can’t help it.

15:09.100 --> 15:12.040
But, if you really sit down you will know that it’s not the

15:12.140 --> 15:14.040
thing that you wanted.

15:14.130 --> 15:16.120
You wanted to be the master of your self.

15:16.240 --> 15:20.050
Now here in this map as we show we have two powers,

15:20.130 --> 15:22.010
left and right powers.

15:22.140 --> 15:26.100
The left power is the power that gives us conditioning –

15:26.190 --> 15:29.160
left side, the subconscious, the collective subconscious.

15:30.010 --> 15:32.030
That gives us the conditioning.

15:32.130 --> 15:35.110
Now, if you try to deny all that, then the right side is

15:35.190 --> 15:37.060
even worse.

15:37.160 --> 15:40.070
It gives us action, but with action we can become very

15:40.160 --> 15:42.150
ego oriented.

15:43.040 --> 15:45.110
So both ways it can be troublesome.

15:45.220 --> 15:47.200
Supposing you say that “All right, I’ll have no

15:48.050 --> 15:50.190
conditioning from anytime. What’s wrong in doing this?

15:51.060 --> 15:52.180
What’s wrong in doing that?”

15:53.100 --> 15:57.190
And if you just move with that idea, with that freedom,

15:58.070 --> 16:00.190
it will be abandonment, it may not be freedom.

16:01.060 --> 16:04.030
Because freedom must have wisdom behind it.

16:04.150 --> 16:05.140
So both the sides,

16:06.000 --> 16:10.030
the movements on both the sides are wrong.

16:10.130 --> 16:11.240
So what is all right?

16:12.090 --> 16:16.200
In the center is not to get conditioned by anything and

16:17.060 --> 16:21.020
not to be ego oriented.

16:21.090 --> 16:23.050
But how to do it is the problem.

16:23.130 --> 16:25.090
The problem is how to do it.

16:25.170 --> 16:31.130
To be spontaneous is to be absolutely free.

16:32.080 --> 16:35.200
Now I would consider these two powers as, say, a brake

16:36.040 --> 16:39.010
and an accelerator in a car.

16:39.090 --> 16:40.220
Now you use both the powers.

16:41.060 --> 16:43.220
You use the brake first, you use the accelerator.

16:44.040 --> 16:46.130
You try to control these two powers.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.140
But, first of all it is difficult to understand

16:49.240 --> 16:51.090
how you can use these powers.

16:51.240 --> 16:53.110
Gradually, with practice you’ll do it.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.060
You know how to drive the car,

16:55.190 --> 16:58.120
you become the good driver.

16:58.190 --> 17:01.010
After becoming the good driver, still

17:01.100 --> 17:04.000
you are not the master of the driving,

17:04.070 --> 17:06.190
but then you become the master.

17:07.040 --> 17:11.180
So, today the master within us, within us is the Spirit.

17:12.020 --> 17:15.190
But before Realization, you are not the master

17:16.070 --> 17:20.220
because the master has not come in our conscious mind.

17:21.060 --> 17:23.140
It is not expressing in our conscious mind.

17:24.030 --> 17:31.070
In the sense that we are not empowered by Its powers.

17:31.190 --> 17:34.050
The Spirit exists; It has Its own powers.

17:34.170 --> 17:38.000
But we haven’t felt those powers within us.

17:38.100 --> 17:40.230
Once we feel the powers of the Spirit,

17:41.080 --> 17:45.200
we are empowered by our own powers which are there.

17:46.070 --> 17:49.020
The powers are within us.

17:49.150 --> 17:51.050
These are our own powers.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.190
We don’t have to borrow from anyone, ask from anyone,

17:54.060 --> 17:55.050
they are in ourselves.

17:55.180 --> 17:57.030
The Spirit is within us –

17:57.120 --> 18:01.100
only thing that Spirit has to bring light in our,

18:02.050 --> 18:05.170
in our consciousness.

18:06.020 --> 18:08.100
It has to come in our consciousness.

18:08.210 --> 18:12.150
In simple medical terminology we can see, say that the

18:12.220 --> 18:19.220
Spirit must manifest Itself in our central nervous system,

18:20.050 --> 18:23.010
in our central nervous system so that we should know

18:23.130 --> 18:24.190
what we are doing.

18:25.040 --> 18:29.090
Not that we start just jumping on the chair, or some

18:29.190 --> 18:32.190
people said, “Oh you, we just start doing it.”

18:33.050 --> 18:35.140
It is hypnosis.

18:35.140 --> 18:38.010
It’s not correct. You’re not in conscious mind.

18:38.100 --> 18:40.090
You are doing it out of hypnosis.

18:40.200 --> 18:44.020
Hypnosis may be coming from outside force.

18:44.020 --> 18:46.230
It’s not your force, your awareness,

18:47.070 --> 18:49.150
your understanding, your power.

18:50.020 --> 18:54.070
It is somebody else’s because you’re not doing it.

18:55.070 --> 18:58.190
As matter has a power to overpower us, in the same way

18:59.030 --> 19:03.020
there are some material things, I should say, which are

19:03.080 --> 19:05.200
very dangerous, which are placed.

19:06.070 --> 19:08.110
For example now cancer, take cancer,

19:08.190 --> 19:10.100
cancer overpowers.

19:10.160 --> 19:11.220
It’s a very serious thing.

19:12.110 --> 19:14.160
Cancer overpowers you; you cannot overpower cancer.

19:15.010 --> 19:16.160
Take a very concrete example.

19:17.000 --> 19:18.150
Now how is it caused?

19:19.000 --> 19:20.050
Doctors say this way, that way.

19:21.020 --> 19:23.190
We, Sahaja Yoga can cure cancer, definitely a hundred

19:24.090 --> 19:26.060
percent it can cure, it has cured.

19:26.180 --> 19:27.220
Many Sahaj Yogis have cured cancer.

19:28.100 --> 19:30.160
How? Is very simple.

19:31.000 --> 19:33.040
That you become master of yourself and you master the

19:33.150 --> 19:35.030
disease also,

19:35.130 --> 19:37.170
you master everything.

19:39.080 --> 19:41.220
Because the master is within you,

19:42.050 --> 19:45.040
it has not come in your conscious mind is the only link is

19:45.150 --> 19:47.220
left, and when that happens Yoga takes place,

19:48.040 --> 19:50.080
union takes place.

19:50.220 --> 19:55.060
We should now completely keep ourselves limited to

19:56.100 --> 19:59.150
Self Realization, about God I’ll tell next time.

20:00.000 --> 20:03.180
Self-Realization means to bring your Spirit

20:04.050 --> 20:06.010
into your conscious mind.

20:06.110 --> 20:09.210
Now how cancer is caused? Let’s see here what happens.

20:10.070 --> 20:12.070
It is caused by left-sided activity.

20:13.000 --> 20:17.180
Now left sided activities are emotional traumas,

20:18.080 --> 20:22.010
emotional problems, emotional upheavals,

20:22.100 --> 20:26.070
emotional insecurities – any kind of insecurity can take

20:26.180 --> 20:28.230
you to the left side.

20:29.090 --> 20:31.100
Little more movement can be these horrible gurus

20:31.190 --> 20:33.000
because they hypnotize you.

20:33.170 --> 20:35.070
They put you to the left.

20:35.070 --> 20:37.130
They put some spirit in you or I don’t know what they do,

20:37.240 --> 20:39.170
but they put you to the left.

20:40.000 --> 20:43.130
Any one of these activities which are not authorized by

20:43.190 --> 20:46.170
God, taken to, you go to the left side,

20:47.010 --> 20:49.080
because you cannot ascend in the center.

20:49.180 --> 20:51.140
So either you go to the left or to the right.

20:51.220 --> 20:55.100
When you overdo these things, like black magic - you

20:55.200 --> 20:58.090
have another thing here I’ve heard,

21:01.010 --> 21:04.010
some sort of a organization had, and the fellow you see

21:04.090 --> 21:07.060
he used to, everything he saw moving in the house.

21:07.140 --> 21:12.000
He came to Sahaj Yoga and his water jug was moving

21:12.120 --> 21:14.100
there and this was moving there and he couldn’t explain

21:14.180 --> 21:15.190
what was happening in his room.

21:16.070 --> 21:17.180
He was sitting down and he found something moving

21:18.040 --> 21:20.050
from here to here. It happens.

21:20.190 --> 21:23.120
What is that? What is that doing this kind of a thing

21:23.220 --> 21:24.230
which you cannot control.

21:25.130 --> 21:27.040
Again we come to the same point –

21:27.160 --> 21:28.220
something you cannot control.

21:29.060 --> 21:32.120
So you enter into the realm, into the realm

21:32.190 --> 21:36.120
where you are controlled and you are not under your own

21:36.210 --> 21:40.030
control and that realm, when you enter in,

21:40.030 --> 21:43.090
I have always seen all the cancer patients

21:43.170 --> 21:47.050
are the ones affected by this.

21:47.150 --> 21:51.060
Most of them. They’re not aware;

21:51.160 --> 21:53.090
they do not know how they get into it.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.160
For a lady, supposing, say she’s suffering from an

21:56.160 --> 22:00.150
insecurity about her husband or maybe something, or

22:00.240 --> 22:03.150
maybe she thinks that her husband may leave her any time.

22:03.230 --> 22:06.140
She loves him. Whatever it is,

22:07.010 --> 22:11.000
such a woman might get a breast cancer,

22:11.090 --> 22:13.230
because the insecurities set in, in one of the centers there

22:14.120 --> 22:17.230
which you can see here, the center of the Heart -

22:18.100 --> 22:20.130
Center heart, as we call it.

22:20.210 --> 22:25.000
Now if this center goes out of order,

22:25.080 --> 22:28.040
if a woman feels insecure for anything whatsoever,

22:28.170 --> 22:32.090
she’s capable – she’s vulnerable to be attacked and she

22:32.150 --> 22:35.090
can get into cancer.

22:35.230 --> 22:38.150
So we have to understand life in totality,

22:39.010 --> 22:41.050
and not in one way.

22:41.140 --> 22:45.120
The total impact of life, the total effect of life,

22:45.210 --> 22:50.160
the total relationship with life must be understood.

22:50.240 --> 22:53.070
Now no doctor knows this.

22:53.150 --> 22:56.230
Will he know, when he treats the patient for, say,

22:57.060 --> 23:02.240
breast cancer will he know that this lady is insecure?

23:03.210 --> 23:05.180
There’s another disease – anorexia –

23:06.010 --> 23:09.130
many girls suffer from it.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.000
They don’t just eat. They just give up eating.

23:12.200 --> 23:16.080
Now, you do not know why it happens.

23:16.160 --> 23:18.130
Doctors can’t cure it; nobody can cure it.

23:18.200 --> 23:20.010
What is the reason?

23:20.090 --> 23:24.120
The relationship of a girl, of a daughter with the father.

23:24.230 --> 23:28.000
Say father dies and the daughter doesn’t see the father,

23:28.110 --> 23:33.020
or in heart she loves the father but she doesn’t express it,

23:33.110 --> 23:36.090
or there’s some bad relationship that comes between the

23:36.170 --> 23:39.150
father and the daughter,

23:39.240 --> 23:41.240
you get this trouble – anorexia.

23:42.090 --> 23:46.190
You’ll be amazed but it is impossible for doctors to get –

23:47.040 --> 23:48.230
we have some doctors sitting here –

23:49.100 --> 23:54.040
it is impossible for any medical science to go near it.

23:56.020 --> 24:00.040
Because we do not see a human being in its totality.

24:00.140 --> 24:03.190
It’s a very delicate instrument God has created.

24:04.050 --> 24:05.210
The way we are harsh with others,

24:06.070 --> 24:11.000
the way we sometimes try to trouble others,

24:12.150 --> 24:17.220
try to make others feel insecured or unfair, unjust.

24:19.000 --> 24:21.140
Without our knowledge we really give them

24:22.110 --> 24:26.190
a tremendous insecurity, and such insecurities can

24:27.040 --> 24:34.030
work out incurable diseases of which we are not aware.

24:34.170 --> 24:38.170
So to understand the totality, what should happen to us?

24:39.040 --> 24:41.150
We should achieve that state where we can see

24:42.070 --> 24:44.060
the totality.

24:44.160 --> 24:48.130
Like if I have to see now, for example, the whole of

24:49.060 --> 24:51.090
Brighton, what should I do?

24:51.170 --> 24:54.230
I should go on a plane and see it from that height.

24:55.070 --> 24:58.150
I can see the whole. In the same way in your awareness,

24:58.230 --> 25:02.000
in your understanding, you should rise to that point from

25:02.080 --> 25:05.120
where you can see the whole.

25:05.210 --> 25:10.080
If you cannot see the whole, the partial vision, or we can

25:10.160 --> 25:16.170
say, a little that you see can create confusion,

25:16.240 --> 25:22.130
can create problems and some of them could be of a

25:22.210 --> 25:25.090
very, very serious nature.

25:25.190 --> 25:31.010
Because as human beings, we do not know what are we.

25:32.090 --> 25:36.100
This is the greatest problem of human beings,

25:36.180 --> 25:39.020
that they’ll say, “I don’t like it.”

25:39.110 --> 25:42.240
Now which one is this “I”? Is that your Spirit, or is that

25:43.080 --> 25:45.110
your ego?

25:45.210 --> 25:47.150
What is the part that is not liking it?

25:48.000 --> 25:50.160
Or is it your conditioning, because you’re brought up in a

25:51.000 --> 25:53.190
particular way so you don’t like this?

25:54.060 --> 25:57.160
Which part of you is not liking it?

25:58.020 --> 26:02.030
And you’d be amazed that it is not your Spirit because if

26:02.140 --> 26:06.100
Spirit likes, how will you know?

26:06.190 --> 26:08.230
It’s only through your vibrations.

26:09.080 --> 26:12.130
When you can feel the vibrations, then only you will say,

26:12.220 --> 26:14.030
“Yes, my Spirit likes it”,

26:14.200 --> 26:17.160
because the vibrations have emitted.

26:18.010 --> 26:22.010
So we are still in a transition state as human beings.

26:22.130 --> 26:26.050
We have not achieved that state which is called as the

26:26.130 --> 26:31.020
state of Self-Realization where you become the Spirit -

26:31.120 --> 26:33.120
the becoming is the point.

26:33.230 --> 26:38.020
Where you become the Spirit you know what you like.

26:38.100 --> 26:42.010
You really know what you really like,

26:42.140 --> 26:45.030
because you are now the reality,

26:45.130 --> 26:47.230
you are not any conditioning,

26:48.100 --> 26:52.150
you are no more an ego, but you are what you are really,

26:52.240 --> 26:54.220
and that is your Spirit.

26:55.070 --> 26:58.100
And, surprisingly this Spirit is a collective being.

26:58.210 --> 27:02.220
Is no artificial collectivity within us.

27:03.080 --> 27:05.130
That also “All right, we belong to all Brighton so we are

27:05.200 --> 27:09.080
one” or “We belong to one street so we are one.”

27:09.160 --> 27:12.210
It’s not like that, but is something that you are,

27:13.060 --> 27:15.190
absolutely you are a collective being,

27:16.020 --> 27:18.190
and you start feeling that collectivity within you

27:19.040 --> 27:21.150
with these different centers working it out.

27:22.010 --> 27:25.010
And you can feel it - others,

27:25.130 --> 27:27.100
you can feel others on your finger tips.

27:27.160 --> 27:28.200
Can you believe?

27:29.030 --> 27:32.150
In the Bible it’s written that your hands will speak.

27:33.160 --> 27:36.160
The description of these days is that your hands will speak.

27:36.230 --> 27:38.200
Why not people go and find out how does it happen?

27:39.060 --> 27:40.160
How can your hands speak?

27:40.240 --> 27:43.220
This is what happens that on your finger tips you start

27:44.060 --> 27:48.140
feeling and understanding what is reality,

27:48.200 --> 27:53.040
what is beauty, what is joy, what is love.

27:56.000 --> 27:58.060
This is the left side

27:58.160 --> 28:03.000
which we get, and ultimately with this left side problems

28:03.080 --> 28:05.240
we get physical pain.

28:06.070 --> 28:09.170
It’s very painful to have left sided problems –

28:10.000 --> 28:11.120
it’s very, very painful.

28:11.200 --> 28:14.220
The pain cannot be explained, no one can understand,

28:15.090 --> 28:18.010
nobody can cure it, you can’t tell anyone

28:18.120 --> 28:21.160
and people think that you are fussing, they give you

28:21.240 --> 28:24.170
psychological treatment, you just don’t understand

28:25.000 --> 28:27.020
why this pain is within you.

28:27.080 --> 28:29.200
And this pain comes to you from left side,

28:30.020 --> 28:32.090
the subconscious.

28:32.150 --> 28:34.110
But beyond the subconscious is the collective

28:34.190 --> 28:36.080
subconscious,

28:36.190 --> 28:40.030
and this collective subconscious is the one where

28:40.090 --> 28:47.030
whatever is created from the beginning up to today

28:47.100 --> 28:51.090
in the creation is within. And once you go to the

28:51.160 --> 28:54.150
subconscious, you just get lost there.

28:55.000 --> 28:58.080
You are so overpowered by this power of subconscious

28:58.190 --> 29:03.070
that it is beyond you to understand it,

29:03.140 --> 29:08.090
beyond you to get out of it and beyond you to –

29:08.210 --> 29:10.130
not to succumb to it.

29:10.210 --> 29:12.160
And it goes on increasing.

29:12.230 --> 29:14.070
Like I asked some people,

29:14.140 --> 29:17.100
“Why did you go on doing it when you knew that you

29:17.200 --> 29:20.000
were not doing it, somebody else was doing it?

29:20.080 --> 29:22.030
Still why did you continue to do it?”

29:22.120 --> 29:24.080
They said, “Mother, we were under the blanket,

29:24.180 --> 29:26.190
it was darkness, we didn’t know where we were moving

29:27.050 --> 29:30.050
and were just going on and on and on.”

29:30.130 --> 29:33.160
And as I told you last time, feeling guilty is the biggest

29:34.010 --> 29:35.170
blockade.

29:35.240 --> 29:38.130
Is the biggest blockade because once you start feeling

29:38.230 --> 29:43.030
guilty that this center on the left gets blocked and the –

29:43.160 --> 29:45.200
it’s very difficult.

29:46.030 --> 29:48.100
And you don’t know why you are feeling guilty.

29:48.170 --> 29:50.140
All the time you’re feeling guilty but you don’t know

29:50.210 --> 29:53.210
why you’re feeling guilty, why these ideas of guilt are

29:54.040 --> 29:57.130
coming to you, that this feeling of guilt keeps you away

29:57.210 --> 30:01.010
from joy, from enjoying anything, from being

30:01.150 --> 30:03.100
spontaneous.

30:03.100 --> 30:10.000
Why? And this explains why we sometimes are

30:10.070 --> 30:12.050
miserable for nothing at all.

30:12.160 --> 30:15.030
Actually, God has not created us to be miserable.

30:15.200 --> 30:18.140
He has made us so beautifully, so carefully.

30:19.040 --> 30:23.180
He has created us with such love and compassion,

30:24.020 --> 30:27.190
not to make us feel miserable, not for anything.

30:28.010 --> 30:31.030
He doesn’t give us any diseases, no problems.

30:31.140 --> 30:34.230
But we have done these things to ourselves by going to

30:35.070 --> 30:37.130
extremes on the left or the right.

30:37.210 --> 30:40.000
As I am today talking about only on the left,

30:40.120 --> 30:43.160
I would say that to feel miserable for nothing at all is

30:44.020 --> 30:48.120
also wrong, is being unjust to yourself.

30:48.230 --> 30:52.070
The people who are left sided must know that they are

30:52.130 --> 30:57.120
the Spirit, that they are that beauty which has to come,

30:57.220 --> 30:59.100
which has to express itself.

30:59.200 --> 31:03.110
That they are not the people who have to suffer

31:03.190 --> 31:07.090
all the time and to live like miserable people.

31:07.160 --> 31:09.010
They are not.

31:09.110 --> 31:12.010
But because they take so much upon themselves,

31:12.090 --> 31:15.160
bear so much upon themselves, they become like that.

31:15.240 --> 31:19.130
And to avoid that bearing up they may take to some other

31:20.010 --> 31:22.050
habits, you see. Many people take to alcohol

31:22.130 --> 31:26.130
also for reason because they can’t bear the pangs of life,

31:26.220 --> 31:29.110
they can’t bear it. That’s why they take to it …

31:29.190 --> 31:32.030
but once the Spirit is awakened within you,

31:32.110 --> 31:36.090
you become so strong. You become so joyous,

31:36.180 --> 31:40.010
so spontaneous that all these things drop out,

31:40.090 --> 31:43.180
all those things – so-called diseases, so-called habits -

31:44.040 --> 31:45.110
just drop out

31:46.080 --> 31:49.190
and you become a new, blooming personality.

31:51.060 --> 31:57.120
Now the basics of having this center within you –

31:58.070 --> 32:01.070
you can blame God for that, “Why did He give us these

32:01.130 --> 32:03.160
centers on the left hand side, what was the need?

32:03.230 --> 32:05.230
He should not have given these left sided ones, so we

32:06.050 --> 32:08.100
would have been just in the center to go.”

32:08.170 --> 32:13.010
But the trouble is the human beings have to know

32:13.080 --> 32:16.210
in their own freedom, how to deal with themselves.

32:17.040 --> 32:20.240
They have to learn little hard way the wisdom.

32:21.050 --> 32:23.040
They have to learn by going to extremes

32:23.160 --> 32:27.120
they have suffered. They have to realize it

32:27.200 --> 32:33.050
because if they have to become truly, absolutely free

32:34.000 --> 32:38.140
they have to rise in their wisdom.

32:38.210 --> 32:42.170
If they’re not wise people, then they cannot enter into the

32:43.000 --> 32:45.050
Kingdom of God, because they’ll be abandoned people.

32:45.180 --> 32:48.240
Say, people who are abandoned, who don’t understand

32:49.070 --> 32:51.210
any laws or regulations, if you get them in England,

32:52.050 --> 32:54.100
we’ll have to put them in jail.

32:54.200 --> 32:58.030
In the same way, human beings who have not got that

32:58.100 --> 33:00.240
wisdom within themselves –

33:01.090 --> 33:03.160
through sufferings only one learns, but we should not ask

33:04.040 --> 33:07.060
for suffering. When we ask for sufferings, we are asking

33:07.130 --> 33:09.190
actually for mistakes to begin with.

33:10.000 --> 33:12.000
How will you suffer if you do not commit mistakes?

33:12.140 --> 33:14.190
So, when we ask for sufferings we are committing

33:15.030 --> 33:16.080
mistakes.

33:16.210 --> 33:19.150
So what we should ask for is nothing but our Spirit,

33:20.000 --> 33:21.240
and if you ask for your Spirit,

33:22.070 --> 33:24.090
it is your own and you have to get it.

33:24.210 --> 33:28.080
It is in your own right that you’re going to get it.

33:28.230 --> 33:31.110
It’s no way that I’m obliging you or doing something

33:31.190 --> 33:33.170
special for you. It’s all there.

33:34.000 --> 33:36.200
You are like a light which is just to be enlightened

33:37.040 --> 33:40.210
because I’m an enlightened light and you become an

33:41.060 --> 33:43.240
enlightened light, you can enlighten other lights also.

33:44.090 --> 33:46.060
It’s very simple.

33:46.060 --> 33:47.190
If you become an enlightened light,

33:48.030 --> 33:49.060
you can enlighten others.

33:49.140 --> 33:50.210
You don’t have to bother about anything else then.

33:51.110 --> 33:55.050
You become an enlightened light yourself, that’s the point.

33:55.130 --> 33:59.100
It is all there, it is all your own, you have to just have it.

33:59.180 --> 34:05.170
It is as simple as that, there is nothing very complicated

34:05.230 --> 34:09.090
as these people make it or anything that these

34:09.090 --> 34:12.020
philosophers have put before you, nothing of the kind.

34:12.110 --> 34:16.080
It’s very simple, it is within you, it is spontaneous,

34:16.150 --> 34:19.120
it is a living process as in living process you have

34:19.120 --> 34:20.220
become human beings,

34:21.090 --> 34:22.230
you are going to become super human beings.

34:23.120 --> 34:26.060
It’s absolutely spontaneous, you can’t pay for it.

34:26.130 --> 34:29.040
How can you pay? I mean, absurd it is!

34:29.120 --> 34:34.170
If it is a living process, how can you pay?

34:34.230 --> 34:37.130
How much do you pay to the tree to grow up?

34:37.210 --> 34:40.210
I mean in anything living, do we pay anything?

34:40.210 --> 34:43.120
How much do we pay our nose to breathe?

34:43.180 --> 34:46.070
Can we pay for it? It’s absurd, it’s ridiculous.

34:46.160 --> 34:49.100
We cannot pay for it, we cannot, it’s a living process,

34:49.190 --> 34:54.000
you have to become, an egg has to become a chick.

34:54.090 --> 34:56.210
Now how much do you pay an egg to become a chick, or

34:57.020 --> 35:01.060
how much does the egg pay to the mother for becoming a

35:01.180 --> 35:02.170
chicken?

35:06.080 --> 35:10.080
It’s that ridiculous, but we never understand that living

35:10.150 --> 35:11.240
things are so spontaneous.

35:12.120 --> 35:14.170
We never see living things, we live with matter,

35:15.000 --> 35:17.150
we live with the dead, not with the living things.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.090
If you start watching a tree, you start watching a flower,

35:21.160 --> 35:24.060
how it becomes a fruit.

35:24.130 --> 35:27.080
You can’t even watch because it does it so slowly,

35:27.150 --> 35:30.020
you can’t even watch a flower becoming a fruit.

35:30.090 --> 35:32.160
Suddenly you find all coming up.

35:32.220 --> 35:37.110
Like when I came to London from India I found all the

35:37.110 --> 35:39.140
trees were bare,

35:39.230 --> 35:43.180
absolutely like dry sticks, absolutely like dry sticks.

35:44.030 --> 35:48.030
Within a week, what I find is the green coming up;

35:48.100 --> 35:50.090
and within second week it was all lush,

35:50.180 --> 35:52.060
you can’t believe it.

35:53.150 --> 35:56.060
We never even notice, we take it for granted.

35:56.170 --> 35:58.130
It’s happening. How does it happen?

35:58.230 --> 36:00.180
It’s a miraculous thing.

36:01.040 --> 36:03.070
If you see it, it’s miraculous how these flowers, for

36:03.130 --> 36:06.040
example the particular flowers are only on a particular

36:06.100 --> 36:09.030
tree and others, another, are on another tree.

36:09.110 --> 36:11.050
How does it happen?

36:11.140 --> 36:13.190
Who chooses them? Who puts them in proper shape?

36:13.190 --> 36:15.220
Who organizes all that?

36:16.050 --> 36:18.110
And this is what one has to realize and

36:18.180 --> 36:21.130
that is the All Pervading Power of God that does

36:22.000 --> 36:24.170
all the living work.

36:25.020 --> 36:28.200
And once you become that – the Spirit – then this power

36:29.020 --> 36:30.240
starts flowing through you.

36:31.050 --> 36:34.110
You feel the power through you as Christ was touched

36:34.190 --> 36:40.000
and He said some power has gone to someone, like that.

36:40.100 --> 36:43.120
You just become a medium of that power flowing.

36:43.230 --> 36:48.180
But you are empowered to maneuver it, to manage it,

36:48.240 --> 36:50.110
to understand it.

36:50.210 --> 36:52.160
You know completely about it, you know how to give it,

36:53.030 --> 36:56.000
you know to how to work it out, you know how to cure

36:56.150 --> 36:58.190
others, cure yourself.

36:59.090 --> 37:02.050
You know the complete working of your machinery.

37:02.160 --> 37:06.030
Apart from that, you get the powers to overcome all the

37:06.130 --> 37:10.090
problems of your own machinery also.

37:10.210 --> 37:12.110
It’s so fantastic.

37:12.210 --> 37:14.150
Whole thing sounds very fantastic because we have

37:14.240 --> 37:16.120
never seen this before.

37:16.240 --> 37:20.030
But to us it doesn’t sound fantastic when we see all these

37:20.120 --> 37:25.060
flowers suddenly turning into fruits. It doesn’t sound.

37:25.160 --> 37:28.220
But we see human beings turning into fruits,

37:29.070 --> 37:31.070
then it sounds very fantastic, “How can that be?”

37:31.180 --> 37:33.110
It has never happened before.

37:33.180 --> 37:36.060
Only one person would get Realization and it was such a

37:36.150 --> 37:38.140
difficult thing and nobody got it.

37:38.230 --> 37:41.000
How is it today?

37:41.220 --> 37:45.130
I say it is the blossom time which is been promised

37:45.230 --> 37:49.080
which is been already prophesized.

37:49.200 --> 37:53.070
Even a great poet in your country, William Blake,

37:53.190 --> 37:55.050
has prophesized it.

37:55.110 --> 37:58.040
He said these times will come when men of God will

37:58.110 --> 38:01.170
become prophets

38:02.010 --> 38:04.240
and these prophets will have power to make other

38:05.090 --> 38:07.090
prophets. I mean nobody could be more precise

38:07.220 --> 38:11.020
than Blake, I tell you. He was so great

38:11.120 --> 38:15.070
to say this will happen and this is what we have to expect

38:15.190 --> 38:17.140
when we go to anybody for seeking.

38:18.000 --> 38:21.000
Have we become prophets? And what is a prophet?

38:21.080 --> 38:23.230
Prophet is a person who is a collective being and

38:24.080 --> 38:29.020
who knows all about it, who is the master.

38:29.110 --> 38:31.220
We call prophet a master.

38:32.030 --> 38:34.160
And that’s what you have to become, the master.

38:35.020 --> 38:37.100
And that mastery is very simple because

38:37.170 --> 38:42.050
it’s all built within you, just it has to be connected.

38:42.160 --> 38:46.080
Like, anything like a television set is to be connected to

38:46.080 --> 38:49.040
the mains, it’s all built in, it’s there, it just starts working.

38:49.130 --> 38:53.060
In the same way, you are that, you are that.

38:53.160 --> 38:55.210
Just it is to be connected.

38:56.040 --> 38:59.000
Whatever may be your caste, community, race,

38:59.070 --> 39:03.060
nationality, shapes, heights – anything, whatever you

39:03.150 --> 39:06.060
may be – makes no difference because all of you have

39:06.190 --> 39:12.050
got this great thing within you, this power of a rebirth

39:12.160 --> 39:15.090
and you are to be born again, and you will be born again.

39:15.240 --> 39:19.020
Why not today?

39:19.170 --> 39:21.210
There’s nothing to get angry, because people get angry

39:22.050 --> 39:27.100
sometimes because they don’t like anybody telling them

39:27.200 --> 39:30.230
about something which of which they themselves are

39:31.060 --> 39:33.000
feeling bad.

39:33.140 --> 39:34.130
They don’t like it.

39:34.190 --> 39:36.240
For example if there’s a drunkard and he drinks too

39:37.110 --> 39:39.180
much, he’s an alcoholic, he doesn’t like it

39:40.040 --> 39:42.060
and he feels bad, and if somebody tells him,

39:42.160 --> 39:44.230
even in the most gentlest way that “You’d better give up

39:45.100 --> 39:47.240
drinking”, he doesn’t like it.

39:48.090 --> 39:52.020
But what I am saying is not that you should not do it,

39:52.120 --> 39:55.240
I said it will happen that it just drops out.

39:56.070 --> 39:58.090
I don’t say, “You don’t do this” or “Don’t do that”

39:59.000 --> 40:01.210
but it just happens. And you must first understand what

40:02.070 --> 40:06.150
is the problem and how the problem is overcome.

40:07.020 --> 40:09.200
That’s why I have to talk, otherwise there’s no need to

40:10.050 --> 40:12.100
talk about it all, it just works out, it just works out

40:12.190 --> 40:16.090
because you are just ready to have it and you just get it.

40:16.180 --> 40:19.140
I don’t do anything. I’m just a catalyst, I should say that

40:19.200 --> 40:22.090
it works out.

40:22.190 --> 40:25.120
I hope you’ll ask Me some questions about it first,

40:25.190 --> 40:30.010
before we go in for any Realization.

40:31.030 --> 40:35.100
If you have any questions, please ask. You must ask.

40:42.130 --> 40:43.070
Yes?

40:44.210 --> 40:48.000
Man: Is there any difference to what You are saying and

40:48.090 --> 40:51.050
what guru Maharaji …

40:52.000 --> 40:53.000
Who?

40:53.110 --> 40:54.110
Man: Guru Maharaji

40:54.210 --> 40:56.220
Now, I’ll tell you one thing.

40:56.220 --> 40:59.150
When you talk about any guru I don’t want to go into

40:59.230 --> 41:02.020
any controversies. All right? That’s first thing I’ll tell you

41:02.100 --> 41:06.000
but I will tell you to ask yourself or ask anyone,

41:06.070 --> 41:08.180
“What has he done for anyone?”

41:09.010 --> 41:11.130
Has he been able to give you any power,

41:11.200 --> 41:14.050
or anyone the power? All right?

41:14.110 --> 41:16.070
Now, I can tell you all these who are here who are

41:16.210 --> 41:18.170
realized souls who are here.

41:19.010 --> 41:20.080
They are just like you to look at.

41:20.150 --> 41:23.050
Of course from face you can make out that they’re very

41:23.120 --> 41:25.040
relaxed and very happy people.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.200
But they can cure people,

41:27.070 --> 41:29.240
they can give Realization to people, they understand

41:30.120 --> 41:35.200
everything that is wrong with you and with themselves also,

41:36.020 --> 41:38.140
So what has he done to your awareness?

41:39.000 --> 41:41.110
Nothing.

41:42.220 --> 41:45.220
Now, his disciples, what have they achieved?

41:46.190 --> 41:49.110
You ask them, “Where is the Kundalini of this person?

41:49.180 --> 41:52.200
What is the problem of this lady or what is weighing

41:53.030 --> 41:55.070
upon her mind?” They won’t be able to say.

41:55.200 --> 41:57.120
If you cannot even make out what’s wrong with another

41:57.200 --> 42:01.070
person or with yourself, how are you going to help?

42:01.150 --> 42:03.180
All such people, what do they do?

42:04.010 --> 42:06.080
Let us see. Simple thing is that

42:06.220 --> 42:09.230
they can mesmerize you.

42:10.040 --> 42:12.210
You may feel happy for awhile – it’s just like drinking.

42:13.030 --> 42:15.090
You know, if you drink, you feel happy.

42:15.190 --> 42:18.090
But, by drinking, what have we achieved?

42:18.180 --> 42:21.150
Have we become masters?

42:24.140 --> 42:26.070
All of them are like that.

42:26.070 --> 42:30.170
You see, a decent women so obviously because he

42:30.230 --> 42:32.030
asked for Rolls Royce.

42:32.110 --> 42:34.050
What is a Rolls Royce for a prophet?

42:34.140 --> 42:36.140
I mean what does it matter?

42:36.200 --> 42:37.190
You see my point?

42:38.020 --> 42:40.110
This is so obvious, I mean this is so logically obvious.

42:40.190 --> 42:42.180
First of all, anybody who takes money from you is a

42:42.240 --> 42:45.040
parasite, simple as that.

42:45.120 --> 42:48.170
And to ask for Rolls Royce of all the things, you see.

42:49.060 --> 42:50.160
You have got Christ.

42:50.220 --> 42:52.050
You can see from Christ’s life –

42:52.050 --> 42:55.040
will He care for your Rolls Royces?

42:56.190 --> 42:59.090
To such a person, He’s a King, He doesn’t bother

42:59.160 --> 43:01.180
whether He has a Rolls Royce or not, whether He sleeps

43:02.000 --> 43:04.020
on the ground or not, makes no difference.

43:04.090 --> 43:06.040
Such a person doesn’t care for anything,

43:06.120 --> 43:10.190
because He is in comfort, He’s got His own comfort.

43:12.080 --> 43:15.010
He is a man of self-respect.

43:15.070 --> 43:17.170
Do you think He would ask for anything whatsoever?

43:18.000 --> 43:21.160
I mean it’s so obvious, for you people it is so obvious.

43:21.220 --> 43:24.030
But when I talk to some people of this guru,

43:24.100 --> 43:26.090
the particular one you are telling Me, they said,

43:26.170 --> 43:29.150
“ Mother, we give him the metal and he gives the Spirit.”

43:29.210 --> 43:32.040
Can there be an exchange?

43:32.130 --> 43:34.000
Can you purchase your Spirit?

43:34.130 --> 43:36.070
Use your logic, all right?

43:36.170 --> 43:38.160
God has given us brains to understand,

43:38.230 --> 43:40.000
logically we can use that.

43:40.170 --> 43:45.050
Can you purchase, can you purchase the Spirit?

43:45.110 --> 43:47.010
Isn’t it so simple?

43:47.090 --> 43:52.080
We can't pay for it, my child, we cannot.

43:52.150 --> 43:54.130
If you want to give Me a flower, all right.

43:54.210 --> 43:59.040
It’s just an expression of your love, and that’s all.

43:59.100 --> 44:03.210
But you can’t purchase Me. You can’t.

44:04.020 --> 44:06.200
Your love can purchase Me, all right, that’s different.

44:07.060 --> 44:09.130
But you can’t purchase Me with metal and money,

44:09.220 --> 44:13.030
can you? What is a Rolls Royce?

44:13.110 --> 44:15.070
I mean I don’t know what are all these crowns and

44:15.150 --> 44:18.010
things. What are they good for?

44:18.010 --> 44:19.220
They don’t give you joy. Go and ask the people who

44:20.030 --> 44:22.090
wear the crowns.

44:22.090 --> 44:24.120
The other day I was with Mrs. Thatcher.

44:24.180 --> 44:29.030
Poor thing, she was so miserable. Yes, she was!

44:29.110 --> 44:33.230
You know I tried to sort of put her down, her vibrations.

44:34.050 --> 44:35.230
She was very miserable. We were just across the table

44:36.070 --> 44:37.160
talking to each other.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.180
And what I was doing was to balance her - poor thing,

44:40.030 --> 44:44.040
she was very, she’s very upset.

44:44.210 --> 44:47.220
So, you must understand, you are too simple people,

44:48.050 --> 44:51.110
you are seekers of ancient times.

44:51.110 --> 44:52.190
You are not seekers of today,

44:53.020 --> 44:54.050
you are seekers of ancient times.

44:54.140 --> 44:57.160
And this time has been promised to you before, also.

44:59.040 --> 45:01.170
And now you have to find it.

45:02.010 --> 45:05.190
Now you must keep your logic straight forward.

45:06.060 --> 45:08.020
I mean anybody who asks for Rolls Royce,

45:08.110 --> 45:11.230
I mean this is one of the stark examples I would say,

45:12.050 --> 45:15.130
cannot be any guru.

45:15.210 --> 45:19.000
It’s the starkest one, absolutely one of the …

45:20.150 --> 45:22.080
But there are subtler ones.

45:22.160 --> 45:23.110
He’s not so subtle.

45:23.210 --> 45:25.230
You will get out of it in no time, I know, all of you.

45:26.110 --> 45:29.080
But the subtler ones are even worse.

45:29.180 --> 45:33.100
Some of them may not even ask for money.

45:33.170 --> 45:34.090
May not.

45:34.190 --> 45:37.120
I don’t know of any, but there may be some because

45:38.050 --> 45:41.200
I heard about someone who doesn’t now take money,

45:42.030 --> 45:42.210
in India.

45:43.160 --> 45:46.080
He has made money here and now he’s gone to India

45:46.170 --> 45:49.170
and he doesn’t take money from them.

45:50.120 --> 45:54.060
But the one who has really not taken money,

45:54.130 --> 46:00.050
one person whom I know, has been using women.

46:03.230 --> 46:06.000
He’s not interested in money part,

46:06.090 --> 46:09.200
he’s using your women.

46:10.040 --> 46:13.130
You see so this is what it is, you must understand.

46:13.210 --> 46:15.190
His interest is not in your Spirit,

46:16.020 --> 46:19.220
but in your purse or in your women. Imagine.

46:20.030 --> 46:24.050
How can holiness be combined with these dirty habits of

46:24.110 --> 46:25.110
people?

46:25.190 --> 46:29.000
That means they themselves are under the control of their

46:29.060 --> 46:34.180
desires which are anti-God.

46:37.200 --> 46:40.100
These are all anti-God activities.

46:40.240 --> 46:44.080
And you people being so simple hearted, I tell you,

46:44.150 --> 46:46.160
you’re so simple hearted!

46:47.000 --> 46:49.170
If you tell an Indian that a guru takes a Rolls Royce,

46:50.000 --> 46:52.240
he said, “Eh.” Immediately they’ll answer.

46:53.060 --> 46:55.180
They don’t want this kind. How can they?

46:56.000 --> 46:58.070
Nobody will give to any guru in India.

46:58.070 --> 47:01.070
Gurus have to pay people sometimes.

47:01.070 --> 47:03.080
First to entice them.

47:03.150 --> 47:05.080
Westernized Indians, it’s different;

47:05.150 --> 47:08.110
but those who are real Indians you see they are.

47:08.180 --> 47:12.090
People live with the mothers and they know what is

47:12.150 --> 47:15.010
what. You know? Nobody can befool them,

47:15.070 --> 47:17.220
they’re very practical people.

47:18.030 --> 47:19.040
Yes, my Child?

47:19.100 --> 47:23.030
Woman: Can you be healed through faith?

47:25.110 --> 47:28.000
The faith is two types –

47:28.090 --> 47:32.040
what we call in Sanskrit is Shraddha is different from

47:32.130 --> 47:34.090
what you call as faith.

47:34.090 --> 47:37.100
In English they use it as “blind faith” and another as

47:37.200 --> 47:40.180
“faith.” All right? We can make it like that.

47:41.010 --> 47:45.080
Now, the blind faith is this, that “I have got faith in God

47:45.170 --> 47:47.100
and God will heal me.”

47:47.160 --> 47:49.040
This is one faith. All right?

47:49.120 --> 47:53.090
Another is a faith which is enlightened where I say

47:53.150 --> 47:55.240
you are the Spirit when you are connected.

47:56.110 --> 48:01.100
Now, if you say that “I have faith in God”,

48:01.170 --> 48:04.110
you shouldn’t feel hurt when I tell you the truth, all right?

48:04.220 --> 48:08.240
Because if it is a blind faith means that you are not yet

48:09.050 --> 48:11.240
connected with the power.

48:12.060 --> 48:13.140
Not connected. See, now

48:13.230 --> 48:18.180
supposing I start saying,  “Christ, Christ, Christ, Christ!”

48:18.240 --> 48:21.230
Christ is not in my pocket.

48:22.170 --> 48:26.140
I can’t even meet a prime minister or a queen without

48:26.210 --> 48:30.010
having a protocol or a connection or some sort of a,

48:30.100 --> 48:37.140
you see, position or, we can say, a authority. Isn’t it?

48:37.140 --> 48:40.000
Now when we talk of anyone like that,

48:40.060 --> 48:42.020
some people go on saying, “Rama, Rama, Rama.

48:42.090 --> 48:45.190
Krishna, Krishna.” You see These are all Incarnations

48:46.030 --> 48:48.230
and Christ is the Son of God,

48:49.070 --> 48:54.030
He is the Son of a King and you just can’t meet Him.

48:54.090 --> 48:55.100
You can’t just call Him.

48:55.230 --> 48:59.230
He’s not at your beck and call,

49:00.060 --> 49:03.000
He’s not your servant. All right?

49:03.130 --> 49:06.240
Now to having faith like that when you are not

49:07.060 --> 49:10.230
connected, if you are healed, you are healed by some

49:10.230 --> 49:14.020
other agencies, not by Christ.

49:14.110 --> 49:17.130
But if you are a realized soul and then you are healed,

49:18.160 --> 49:22.090
then it is done by Christ.

49:22.090 --> 49:23.000
I’ll tell you a difference,

49:23.120 --> 49:26.000
a very clear cut difference of healing.

49:26.100 --> 49:29.050
We have in England – we had, I don’t know now if you

49:29.110 --> 49:32.090
have that one, it’s an organization called a

49:33.060 --> 49:37.140
International Curative Center of Late Dr. Lang.

49:37.240 --> 49:43.090
Now this Dr. Lang was dead, I mean he was late

49:44.010 --> 49:46.170
but he had a curative center.

49:47.000 --> 49:52.060
You see, and this gentleman died

49:52.150 --> 49:59.020
and he possessed a man in Vietnam, a soldier,

49:59.120 --> 50:01.210
not his own son but a soldier.

50:02.060 --> 50:04.180
Now this soldier was told by this fellow – I mean,

50:05.020 --> 50:07.020
they’re very honest people, being English,

50:07.120 --> 50:09.000
they are honest and they tell the truth, you see.

50:09.120 --> 50:11.240
They don’t say that “we do it through God” or anything.

50:12.100 --> 50:15.160
So he told that there are many doctors

50:16.020 --> 50:19.050
(I hope the doctors won’t mind) who have died and who

50:19.130 --> 50:24.060
were very ambitious are still wanting to cure people.

50:24.170 --> 50:27.050
And he should “Go back to my son and tell him all the

50:27.130 --> 50:32.020
story that I’ve come in you and my son will believe.”

50:32.100 --> 50:33.180
So he said, “How will he believe me?”

50:34.020 --> 50:35.170
He said, “No, no. I will tell you some secrets

50:36.040 --> 50:38.110
which only he and me, both of us share.

50:38.230 --> 50:41.040
So he’ll definitely believe you.”

50:41.160 --> 50:43.220
So this fellow agreed. He was a very healthy fellow,

50:44.070 --> 50:47.080
actually this spirit entered into him when he got into a

50:47.150 --> 50:49.060
sudden shock,

50:49.170 --> 50:52.040
something he saw which shocked him in the war and this

50:52.040 --> 50:53.150
spirit entered.

50:53.150 --> 50:57.150
And he was carried by that spirit somehow or other to

50:58.010 --> 51:00.100
England where he met his son

51:00.190 --> 51:02.080
and he told the whole story.

51:02.080 --> 51:03.210
And the son had to believe because

51:04.050 --> 51:05.160
he knew so many secrets.

51:06.130 --> 51:08.080
And they started this curative center.

51:08.150 --> 51:11.000
Now how do I come to know of late Mr. Lang

51:11.100 --> 51:13.030
is the thing.

51:13.120 --> 51:20.000
They cured a lady who was in India – long time back

51:20.000 --> 51:22.070
it was 1970 I’m telling you –

51:22.160 --> 51:24.220
and she came to see Me, and she was all shaking,

51:25.030 --> 51:26.090
nervous, she’s like this.

51:26.170 --> 51:27.150
I said, “What’s this?”

51:27.240 --> 51:30.190
She said, “I was sick with a certain disease and

51:31.040 --> 51:35.200
I was afraid of an operation and I came to know about

51:36.020 --> 51:38.110
this organization, I wrote to them

51:39.010 --> 51:41.200
and they wrote to me saying that "At this time on this

51:42.020 --> 51:44.130
date we’ll enter into your body."

51:44.130 --> 51:47.040
Openly, I mean they don’t say that

51:47.040 --> 51:48.150
“We are God” or anything.

51:48.150 --> 51:51.060
“We’ll enter into your body and you’ll feel a little

51:51.130 --> 51:52.230
shaking, doesn’t matter,

51:53.050 --> 51:55.180
and you’ll sleep off and we’ll work it out.”

51:56.010 --> 51:58.180
And she said, “I got cured of that disease.”

51:59.180 --> 52:02.030
But after three years or so,

52:02.130 --> 52:06.220
the whole body started shaking and she couldn’t bear it

52:07.040 --> 52:08.240
anymore and she came to see Me.

52:09.080 --> 52:12.070
That’s how I came to know about Dr. Lang, you see,

52:12.140 --> 52:17.110
that he had – this poor lady was tortured for three years,

52:17.180 --> 52:20.180
she suffered so much and then she came to see Me.

52:21.010 --> 52:24.110
So after Mr. Lang entered into her body – Dr. Lang –

52:24.200 --> 52:26.220
it was after six years that she came to see Me because

52:26.220 --> 52:28.160
three years she was all right,

52:29.000 --> 52:30.220
and after three years it started.

52:31.090 --> 52:33.100
And that’s how I came to know all the spirits that had

52:33.190 --> 52:35.240
entered into her, the doctors and all that.

52:36.100 --> 52:38.000
It was a horrible case.

52:38.090 --> 52:40.100
Of course she got cured later on, no doubt.

52:40.200 --> 52:42.180
Because when you become the Spirit,

52:43.010 --> 52:45.200
you are in your fort, nobody can enter into your body.

52:46.010 --> 52:50.150
You become something which doesn’t get contaminated,

52:50.230 --> 52:56.020
doesn’t get over powered, nobody can dominate.

52:56.110 --> 52:58.000
And that’s how she got cured.

52:58.090 --> 53:01.030
So with faith, if somebody says,

53:01.100 --> 53:03.130
“Oh, you will be healed” you see

53:03.190 --> 53:06.060
and they start shouting and screaming and this and that,

53:06.130 --> 53:09.160
and suddenly you might feel, maybe there’s a spirit.

53:09.230 --> 53:11.210
They replace also sometimes these spirits,

53:12.030 --> 53:13.060
it’s very surprising.

53:13.170 --> 53:15.200
They can replace a spirit from one to another.

53:16.030 --> 53:17.170
I’ve seen such cases also.

53:17.230 --> 53:19.150
All kinds of things I have seen in spirits.

53:19.230 --> 53:23.200
The other day, only about eight days back, wasn’t that,

53:24.010 --> 53:27.140
Marie, when this charismatic fellow came in?

53:27.240 --> 53:32.220
Eight days back in France a gentleman came in.

53:33.060 --> 53:38.030
Young fellow, must be about twenty-four or so,

53:38.150 --> 53:44.020
he got into such a big agitation and started crying and

53:44.080 --> 53:48.030
funny type of a thing that I’ve never seen a spirit enter

53:48.130 --> 53:49.120
into him.

53:49.230 --> 53:52.060
Whole body was shaking. And I mean he fell down,

53:52.140 --> 53:56.020
he started crying, weeping, all sorts of things happened.

53:56.090 --> 53:58.150
And he said that “I went to charismatic movement where

53:58.210 --> 54:00.110
I got it.” And then they get it

54:00.190 --> 54:02.240
and they think Holy Ghost has entered into them.

54:03.060 --> 54:04.060
Now just imagine.

54:05.000 --> 54:07.030
How can Holy Ghost make you miserable?

54:07.130 --> 54:10.100
I don’t know from where these ideas come in.

54:10.190 --> 54:13.130
And poor child, you know, he suffered so much.

54:13.190 --> 54:14.220
Now he’s all right.

54:15.070 --> 54:17.070
But he couldn’t believe it that you could be all right

54:17.180 --> 54:19.170
because he thought … and then they say,

54:19.170 --> 54:22.070
“These are your sins and you have to get over your sins

54:22.180 --> 54:25.050
and this is why you are, what’s happening to you,

54:25.130 --> 54:27.180
you still have done bad karmas, and this and that.

54:28.020 --> 54:31.010
But your bad karmas and all those things can be solved

54:31.100 --> 54:33.160
when the Kundalini rises.

54:33.240 --> 54:39.170
There is a center for this specially which is really

54:40.150 --> 54:46.040
being adorned by Jesus Christ here.

54:46.130 --> 54:48.110
Did you tell them, about this center?

54:48.180 --> 54:50.070
All right.

54:50.150 --> 54:52.240
So this is the center and when the Kundalini passes

54:53.060 --> 54:55.130
through that – that’s why they say that you have to pass

54:55.220 --> 54:57.040
through it.

54:57.140 --> 55:00.070
He gets awakened and when He gets awakened all these

55:01.040 --> 55:03.160
two pouches you see there of ego and superego,

55:04.000 --> 55:06.200
your conditioning and all your left sided problems

55:07.020 --> 55:09.170
and right sided problems are sucked in.

55:10.010 --> 55:12.190
That’s why they said that He died for our sins.

55:13.040 --> 55:15.070
He’s described in the ancient Indian scriptures as

55:15.160 --> 55:17.090
Mahavishnu but you see very –

55:17.220 --> 55:22.020
the missionaries went to India they gave a very wrong

55:22.100 --> 55:24.100
picture of Christ, absolutely wrong picture,

55:24.190 --> 55:28.090
so they were still expecting Mahavishnu to come in.

55:28.170 --> 55:30.000
And this is what it is.

55:30.110 --> 55:32.000
He’s supposed

55:32.220 --> 55:35.150
to be, according to missionaries, somebody who sort of

55:36.010 --> 55:39.130
converts people and all that nonsense. See?

55:39.130 --> 55:40.220
It’s not the real thing, that

55:41.060 --> 55:42.180
He is to be awakened within you.

55:42.240 --> 55:46.170
He said that. He said, “I have to be born within you.”

55:46.240 --> 55:48.100
And that is what it is.

55:48.170 --> 55:52.080
When Kundalini rises, She awakens that center within us

55:52.230 --> 55:56.030
and all our conditionings and egos are sucked in,

55:56.150 --> 56:00.070
a space is created here in the fontanel bone area through

56:00.160 --> 56:02.200
which the Kundalini comes in and you can feel the cool

56:03.030 --> 56:05.140
breeze from your head coming out.

56:05.240 --> 56:08.070
That’s what it is, and you feel it in your hands.

56:08.200 --> 56:11.230
It’s not just that you’re mad after someone, you see?

56:12.060 --> 56:14.040
It isn’t like that.

56:14.110 --> 56:16.140
It’s not that way, you see,

56:16.240 --> 56:18.090
nothing of that kind.

56:18.180 --> 56:23.070
You become a self-respecting, normal, dignified

56:23.200 --> 56:29.100
personality of great spiritual value which you are.

56:29.220 --> 56:30.170
All right?

56:30.230 --> 56:35.230
So this is what faith is and what is blind faith is.

56:37.220 --> 56:39.110
Yes, my child.

56:39.200 --> 56:43.040
Man: It seems very difficult the concept that Self

56:43.120 --> 56:46.240
Realization doesn’t involve some personal effort.

56:47.120 --> 56:53.020
Can it really come to anybody in effect of how

56:53.170 --> 56:58.010
materialistic they are? Am I understanding this?

56:59.070 --> 57:03.230
Yes, it appears on the face of it very difficult

57:04.110 --> 57:08.080
and how people are materialistic is also true no doubt,

57:08.190 --> 57:13.020
but Spirit is much stronger than the matter

57:13.090 --> 57:14.190
and when It has to express,

57:15.080 --> 57:20.240
It completely crushes all that and It comes.

57:21.070 --> 57:23.230
Now we have here, most of you are English people,

57:24.050 --> 57:26.240
I should say, westernized, very materialistic people they

57:27.070 --> 57:29.150
are there. I should say I mean living in that world,

57:29.230 --> 57:31.100
they may not have been that materialistic because if they

57:31.220 --> 57:35.040
are not seekers, they would not come to Me.

57:35.140 --> 57:38.170
But a new being has been born.

57:38.170 --> 57:40.090
If you look at an egg you feel,

57:40.180 --> 57:42.180
“Oh, what a hard stuff is this!”

57:43.200 --> 57:46.090
But if it is broken at the right moment,

57:46.160 --> 57:50.120
with the right understanding, it becomes a bird.

57:50.180 --> 57:54.040
Because a living process is all, only the last breakthrough

57:54.110 --> 57:55.200
has to take place.

57:56.090 --> 58:01.050
Apparently it looks difficult, but to Me it is not.

58:01.130 --> 58:04.070
Perhaps I know the job.

58:04.140 --> 58:06.030
All right?

58:09.220 --> 58:11.240
Yes, it looks … many people have said all kinds of

58:12.050 --> 58:13.150
things about Kundalini, also.

58:13.230 --> 58:16.070
I must say some books I have seen have horrified.

58:16.160 --> 58:18.090
You see if you don’t know the job, everything –

58:18.170 --> 58:20.180
supposing if somebody else doesn’t know how to drive a

58:21.020 --> 58:22.220
car, you see, and he gets into the car

58:23.070 --> 58:24.190
the way he’d describe it would be horrifying.

58:25.020 --> 58:28.100
You’d never get near a car, isn’t it? It’s like that.

58:28.180 --> 58:31.040
The one who is not authorized and does not know the job

58:31.120 --> 58:33.130
should not do it.

58:33.220 --> 58:37.120
But that’s what happens to you, that you become

58:37.200 --> 58:40.090
the Spirit, you become your own master

58:40.160 --> 58:43.030
and you become the master of this art –

58:43.090 --> 58:44.240
the master of this art.

58:45.050 --> 58:47.000
Yes, my child?

58:57.010 --> 58:58.020
I couldn't hear you?

59:02.180 --> 59:05.240
You mentioned hypnosis earlier and You also said that

59:06.080 --> 59:08.000
You regarded Yourself as a catalyst and

59:08.120 --> 59:13.150
don’t You think that the hypnotist also regards himself as

59:14.070 --> 59:15.000
a catalyst?

59:15.170 --> 59:18.000
Yes, Yes no doubt.

59:18.120 --> 59:21.110
Yes, yes that’s true, but the difference is this,

59:22.020 --> 59:25.140
that the hypnotist brings you under his power,

59:25.220 --> 59:29.010
he doesn’t give you any power or no dimension to your

59:29.070 --> 59:30.110
awareness - you see?

59:30.230 --> 59:33.110
There’s a tremendous difference between the two.

59:33.190 --> 59:36.110
You see, you have got your own power within you.

59:36.190 --> 59:39.090
Say, for example, all right, your Spirit there.

59:39.180 --> 59:42.190
Now I’m a catalyst, you see, you can use a spoon for

59:43.000 --> 59:47.240
giving a poison or could use it for giving a nectar,

59:48.060 --> 59:49.070
all right?

59:49.200 --> 59:53.040
So if you give the nectar, then it’s a great thing;

59:53.120 --> 59:56.170
and if you give the poison, it’s horrible. It’s like that.

59:56.170 --> 59:59.160
Now the hypnotist uses hypnosis –

59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.140
how does he hypnotize is the point.

01:00:02.210 --> 01:00:05.200
What he does is to push you into your subconscious,

01:00:06.030 --> 01:00:07.120
into your collective subconscious

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:11.070
where he overpowers you. You are under his power.

01:00:11.150 --> 01:00:14.070
He says, “You become like a child”, you become like a child.

01:00:14.170 --> 01:00:16.020
“You suck a little bottle”, you do it.

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:17.070
What’s all this?

01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:20.190
But here you become the Spirit in the sense that you

01:00:21.050 --> 01:00:23.050
become collectively conscious.

01:00:24.130 --> 01:00:28.100
It’s no hypnosis because you, yourself, can feel it.

01:00:28.200 --> 01:00:31.020
Now, say example you take ten children

01:00:31.110 --> 01:00:32.060
who are realized souls.

01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:34.100
There are some children who are realized souls,

01:00:34.210 --> 01:00:36.110
even little children.

01:00:36.230 --> 01:00:39.030
And you take them near a person who is suffering from

01:00:39.120 --> 01:00:41.030
some trouble, all right?

01:00:41.120 --> 01:00:43.210
Now you tie up their eyes and ask them,

01:00:44.060 --> 01:00:46.200
“What’s the problem of this gentleman?”

01:00:46.200 --> 01:00:49.090
They will raise the same fingers, all of them

01:00:49.220 --> 01:00:52.040
will raise the same fingers and say, “This is burning”,

01:00:52.100 --> 01:00:55.170
you see, because the sensation you feel – of burning,

01:00:55.240 --> 01:00:58.030
of numbness or of cool breeze,

01:00:59.160 --> 01:01:04.090
a new awareness of a vibratory nature is born within you.

01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:07.090
Not with hypnosis, on the contrary, after hypnosis you

01:01:07.170 --> 01:01:10.220
feel so tired and finished as if somebody has been riding

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:13.160
your horse.

01:01:14.070 --> 01:01:15.160
It’s just the other way around.

01:01:16.050 --> 01:01:18.240
And you start growing into you and understanding,

01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:22.230
you can cure people you understand what are the centers

01:01:23.050 --> 01:01:24.070
that are catching,

01:01:24.170 --> 01:01:26.110
you understand what are the centers of another person

01:01:26.190 --> 01:01:27.240
that are catching.

01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.150
In the beginning sometimes people have confusion, I've seen,

01:01:30.220 --> 01:01:33.040
that they don’t know “whether these are my

01:01:33.130 --> 01:01:34.130
centers or your centers.”

01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.080
Now we have ways and methods by which you can

01:01:36.180 --> 01:01:37.180
discriminate.

01:01:38.010 --> 01:01:39.180
You can see which are your centers catching and which

01:01:40.010 --> 01:01:41.210
are the centers the other person catching.

01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:45.140
You also know how to get them all right,

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.070
you also know how to give Realization to others,

01:01:48.160 --> 01:01:52.130
and to empower them with their own powers.

01:01:52.220 --> 01:01:55.140
It’s just the opposite.

01:01:55.210 --> 01:01:58.030
But catalyst could be horrifying,

01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:02.240
and catalyst could be just heavenly.

01:02:08.130 --> 01:02:11.140
Question: Can some people

01:02:12.060 --> 01:02:14.230
Self Realize themselves with their own effort?

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:16.130
With their own effort?

01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:20.240
I don’t think it’s possible, you see, because

01:02:21.160 --> 01:02:24.240
like a light which is enlightened can only enlighten

01:02:25.070 --> 01:02:26.140
another light.

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:31.110
But what I’m saying, that even supposing like Buddha,

01:02:31.180 --> 01:02:33.200
you see, He got His Realization when He was

01:02:34.040 --> 01:02:36.050
absolutely tired and He had to have it.

01:02:36.140 --> 01:02:38.140
Of course the Holy Ghost did that. He could not have

01:02:38.210 --> 01:02:39.230
done it on Him,

01:02:40.190 --> 01:02:44.180
but He got the Realization there because it was a

01:02:45.010 --> 01:02:47.180
different circumstance which He had to live,

01:02:48.020 --> 01:02:49.080
He didn’t have to talk about God,

01:02:49.210 --> 01:02:51.190
He didn’t have to talk about the whole thing,

01:02:52.060 --> 01:02:56.150
because people were so much engaged in talking of big

01:02:56.220 --> 01:03:01.100
things like God and about all kind of deities, this, that,

01:03:01.190 --> 01:03:03.070
there was a big confusion.

01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:06.030
And somebody was to be Realized at that time

01:03:06.110 --> 01:03:08.080
who would just localize it and say, “Only Self

01:03:08.180 --> 01:03:11.230
Realization – don’t talk of God or anything, forget it.”

01:03:12.070 --> 01:03:14.090
That’s why He got Realization like that.

01:03:14.210 --> 01:03:17.060
But you cannot get Realization just like that –

01:03:17.160 --> 01:03:21.090
only possession you can get. You cannot.

01:03:21.170 --> 01:03:24.100
Somebody who is an enlightened soul,

01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:28.130
such an enlightened soul doesn’t take money from you.

01:03:28.220 --> 01:03:31.120
Normally, you see, people don’t want to give you Relization -

01:03:31.190 --> 01:03:33.230
ninety-nine percent of those who are really realized,

01:03:34.070 --> 01:03:36.030
they’ll throw stones at you,

01:03:36.120 --> 01:03:38.040
they won’t have anything to do because their experiences

01:03:38.180 --> 01:03:40.080
of human beings are horrifying.

01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.100
If you go and talk to them, they’ll tell Me, they told Me

01:03:43.210 --> 01:03:45.040
that “Wait for twelve years.

01:03:45.120 --> 01:03:48.140
See, Mother, they will all finish You off, they’ll kill You,

01:03:48.240 --> 01:03:50.090
they’ll do this.”

01:03:50.180 --> 01:03:52.190
It’s very venturesome to deal with human beings because

01:03:53.020 --> 01:03:56.150
they’ll be very egoistical and they will never accept you.

01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.240
But if you take like this, like

01:04:02.110 --> 01:04:07.060
somebody who knows is a help, isn’t it?

01:04:07.230 --> 01:04:12.160
And Realization is not possible, is not possible to be

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.090
done by yourself.

01:04:15.190 --> 01:04:19.200
It’s not possible, because if a, say, a candle which is not

01:04:20.050 --> 01:04:22.070
enlightened wants to get itself enlightened,

01:04:22.140 --> 01:04:25.210
the light has to be brought, isn’t it?

01:04:26.050 --> 01:04:27.220
It’s so simple like that.

01:04:28.050 --> 01:04:30.200
But one should not feel bad about it, actually.

01:04:30.200 --> 01:04:33.160
See, I don’t know how to drive, somebody drove Me down here.

01:04:33.230 --> 01:04:37.190
I didn’t feel bad that he had to drive Me down, did I?

01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:39.190
And I only know one job.

01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:40.180
I don’t know many.

01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.120
Many jobs I don’t know, I don’t know how to operate

01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:44.030
bank, I don’t know how to write a check,

01:04:44.120 --> 01:04:46.200
I’m hopeless in many things.

01:04:47.180 --> 01:04:50.010
I don’t know how to open a can, maybe.

01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:53.100
But I know how to open the Kundalini. All right?

01:04:53.190 --> 01:04:56.020
So if I know one job, why should you mind?

01:04:56.020 --> 01:05:00.100
After all, we depend on each other for everything, isn't it?

01:05:00.160 --> 01:05:03.120
So why not, if I know the job, what’s the harm?

01:05:03.210 --> 01:05:06.110
And you will know, too.

01:05:06.210 --> 01:05:08.040
You will know, too.

01:05:08.130 --> 01:05:10.200
But it cannot be done by yourself.

01:05:11.050 --> 01:05:15.230
But actually in this you’re not obliged for anything.

01:05:18.090 --> 01:05:21.060
I just do it because I love it.

01:05:21.140 --> 01:05:23.100
It’s just emits, I don’t do anyway, I’m just flowing,

01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.090
I don’t know how it happens, just it’s flowing.

01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:37.080
I just love for love’s sake.

01:05:37.230 --> 01:05:39.160
You can’t believe such a person can exist,

01:05:40.050 --> 01:05:42.210
but I do really, I am like that.

01:05:43.090 --> 01:05:45.130
Sometimes you might even, some of the Sahaja Yogis

01:05:45.210 --> 01:05:48.220
do feel that I’m too compassionate and that I should be

01:05:49.030 --> 01:05:51.090
rather strict with people and things like that, you see.

01:05:51.170 --> 01:05:55.180
They come and tell Me some wisdom about it.

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:01.190
You see they think I’m not so practical,

01:06:02.040 --> 01:06:05.100
but this is the most practical thing.

01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:09.010
Yes, I know they make mistakes because they

01:06:09.010 --> 01:06:10.200
don't know they are walking in darkness.

01:06:11.020 --> 01:06:13.160
If you are walking in darkness, you will bang at something.

01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:15.210
Then only thing you can do is to have compassion for

01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:20.210
them because they can’t see, they are blind. Isn’t it?

01:06:21.040 --> 01:06:25.040
How can you have any anger or temper?

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:37.170
And moreover, I would request you not to have any

01:06:38.010 --> 01:06:41.000
misidentification with anyone whatsoever.

01:06:41.060 --> 01:06:44.140
You have to get to your Spirit, that’s the main thing.

01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.120
If you still think of somebody, you see,

01:06:47.220 --> 01:06:49.140
like the lady – I don’t know, somebody might have sent

01:06:49.230 --> 01:06:52.070
her here, maybe. I don’t know why she got angry.

01:06:52.130 --> 01:06:54.200
I didn’t say anything to hurt her.

01:06:54.200 --> 01:06:55.230
May be she is possessed.

01:06:55.230 --> 01:06:59.000
I don’t know why she has got angry with Me,

01:06:59.090 --> 01:07:01.070
and she just got up and just walked off saying that

01:07:01.130 --> 01:07:03.020
“You’re telling everything lies.”

01:07:05.100 --> 01:07:07.110
Why should I tell you lies?

01:07:07.200 --> 01:07:10.170
I don’t have to get anything out of you.

01:07:12.180 --> 01:07:14.000
But why it happens?

01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.200
Because she’s not sensitive,

01:07:16.040 --> 01:07:19.030
she’s not sensitive to Divinity.

01:07:20.090 --> 01:07:22.040
She doesn’t understand who’s Divine, who’s...

01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.110
I don’t blame her.

01:07:25.210 --> 01:07:27.140
She hasn’t got the sensitivity. It’s a caliber.

01:07:27.230 --> 01:07:30.060
I have seen Sahaja Yogis now of different varieties

01:07:30.130 --> 01:07:31.170
have come to Me.

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.150
Some of them are of such a caliber you can’t even believe.

01:07:34.220 --> 01:07:36.100
They get into Realization, they know what it is,

01:07:36.210 --> 01:07:38.090
they have the pattern just like a diamond,

01:07:38.180 --> 01:07:40.030
they get it and they get to it.

01:07:40.150 --> 01:07:42.130
They’re tremendous people.

01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:45.080
There are some who slog behind.

01:07:45.140 --> 01:07:51.010
Some of them who get Realization but still

01:07:51.200 --> 01:07:54.010
they go on doubting. All kinds.

01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:58.150
Doesn’t matter. I love all of them.

01:08:00.110 --> 01:08:02.020
Yes, my child?

01:08:18.230 --> 01:08:21.030
He is a Sahaja yogi?

01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:38.150
If before Realization we were such a horrible person that

01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.070
we gave cancer to everybody we met or something like

01:08:41.150 --> 01:08:47.020
this, after Realization does the effects of that get taken

01:08:47.090 --> 01:08:49.050
away, or what happens?

01:08:49.150 --> 01:08:53.030
Yah. I know it, so many things have happened.

01:08:53.120 --> 01:08:56.110
We had somebody in Brighton, you remember –

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:59.010
he’s here right now, I think –

01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:02.070
who was drunk when he came in.

01:09:02.160 --> 01:09:04.140
He was very angry with Me, you see, to begin with.

01:09:04.220 --> 01:09:06.150
He said, “How can I get rid of this trouble?

01:09:06.220 --> 01:09:08.090
I can’t believe You”, and all that.

01:09:08.190 --> 01:09:10.170
And he’s all right, perfectly all right.

01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.130
His change is so beautiful, you can’t… is he there?

01:09:14.130 --> 01:09:15.080
Yogi: Yes , I am.

01:09:15.160 --> 01:09:17.210
May God bless you.

01:09:21.180 --> 01:09:22.180
He’s so sweet now.

01:09:23.030 --> 01:09:25.090
The other day he came to see Me.

01:09:26.130 --> 01:09:28.230
I said, “Look at that. He’s so sweet.”

01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:31.190
He was a very sweet man, wasn’t he?

01:09:32.040 --> 01:09:36.160
But something had put him up, made him upset, you see,

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:39.110
that he became alcoholic, you see.

01:09:39.210 --> 01:09:41.130
He’s all right.

01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:45.140
The compassion can only make you understand that

01:09:45.230 --> 01:09:47.160
there’s a reason for this –

01:09:48.070 --> 01:09:52.040
He is a very sweet person, very sweet person no doubt.

01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:55.020
But something had gone wrong with him.

01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:57.120
It’s all right.

01:09:59.190 --> 01:10:01.180
So this happens, it’s true.

01:10:03.110 --> 01:10:05.040
Sahaja Yogis realize this.

01:10:05.130 --> 01:10:09.030
Some, of course, I must say, go little bit.

01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:12.140
Doesn’t matter. They’ll come up, all of them will come,

01:10:12.230 --> 01:10:15.160
I’m sure of it.

01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:21.240
Everyone is made for it.

01:10:22.090 --> 01:10:25.040
Actually, the Divine is anxious to give you Realization –

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:29.110
much more, much more anxious than you are.

01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:31.080
If there were thousand people today,

01:10:31.190 --> 01:10:33.240
I would have given them Realization better.

01:10:34.110 --> 01:10:36.180
But very few people take to reality, you see now.

01:10:37.050 --> 01:10:39.150
That guru maharaji, thousands are like mad after him,

01:10:40.100 --> 01:10:42.110
isn’t it?

01:10:42.230 --> 01:10:46.120
He’s given nothing to the poor people.

01:10:47.100 --> 01:10:51.020
But for reality, there are very few.

01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.150
Like other day somebody asked Me a question,

01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.190
“Mother, why don’t You do it to everyone?”

01:10:58.050 --> 01:11:00.050
I said, “Where are they, everyone?

01:11:00.140 --> 01:11:03.070
They are busy. Where are they?

01:11:03.160 --> 01:11:06.200
In this Brighton, how many there are?

01:11:07.160 --> 01:11:09.200
How many are here?

01:11:10.040 --> 01:11:12.140
All right? That’s the problem.

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:18.100
It takes time for people to love reality. Time.

01:11:18.210 --> 01:11:21.220
It’s such a beautiful thing.

01:11:22.070 --> 01:11:25.060
And even they get realized, then they drop out, you see.

01:11:25.140 --> 01:11:27.030
They say, “Oh, I’m all right now. I’m all right.”

01:11:27.130 --> 01:11:30.020
After one year they’ll appear.

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:31.140
That’s not the way.

01:11:31.220 --> 01:11:34.160
You have to master this art, absolutely master it.

01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.150
It is all free, absolutely free.

01:11:37.230 --> 01:11:42.070
Now they are all sitting down here, they can say that.

01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:46.130
Would You talk a bit more about Self Realization and

01:11:47.030 --> 01:11:49.150
what’s necessary to enhance that.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:54.230
Yes, Yes, I will be in my next lecture, one by one.

01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:57.180
Now I’m talking the left side, the right side,

01:11:58.040 --> 01:12:00.130
and then the center, and then also, of course,

01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:01.190
about the Spirit.

01:12:02.040 --> 01:12:04.110
Definitely, hundred times, that’s what I have to do.

01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:07.100
But gradually I have to build you up. All right?

01:12:07.190 --> 01:12:09.020
I will definitely. You won’t believe,

01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:14.090
I think I have given five hundred lectures already

01:12:14.170 --> 01:12:17.190
in London, at least. And it doesn’t end.

01:12:18.020 --> 01:12:19.180
Every time, they say last time I spoke they said,

01:12:20.020 --> 01:12:21.210
“Mother it was absolutely a new dimension

01:12:22.070 --> 01:12:23.200
You talked about”, you see.

01:12:24.050 --> 01:12:26.000
I don’t know, Kerry told Me first time he touched his

01:12:26.090 --> 01:12:27.230
vibrations so much with my lecture

01:12:28.130 --> 01:12:31.160
I don’t know what I touched him so much.

01:12:31.230 --> 01:12:33.120
Yes, it’s surprising.

01:12:33.210 --> 01:12:35.150
He’s from Australia.

01:12:35.240 --> 01:12:40.070
Australians do well. Very fast work.

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:44.080
So, all the questions are over now? Should we have it?

01:12:46.190 --> 01:12:48.040
What are karmas?

01:12:48.110 --> 01:12:55.070
Karmas are when you do any work or anything with your

01:12:55.130 --> 01:12:58.240
right side action then

01:13:00.050 --> 01:13:04.020
the effects of that accumulate within you as an ego

01:13:04.110 --> 01:13:05.200
because you think you are doing it.

01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:08.210
Actually, we don’t do anything substantial.

01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:11.190
What we do is a dead work like as I said we make a chair

01:13:12.010 --> 01:13:14.090
out of a dead, a tree.

01:13:14.150 --> 01:13:16.230
That’s all we do. What work we do is an idea we have

01:13:17.070 --> 01:13:18.060
we are doing work.

01:13:18.140 --> 01:13:19.140
What work are you doing?

01:13:20.030 --> 01:13:21.230
Can you convert this into a fruit?

01:13:22.060 --> 01:13:25.030
We can’t even put fragrance into it.

01:13:25.180 --> 01:13:28.210
So this myth, you see, works as ego within us as shown

01:13:29.040 --> 01:13:31.210
here, which I will be speaking tomorrow about, all right?

01:13:32.070 --> 01:13:34.200
And this is what is that we think we are doing this work,

01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:39.030
that work, and this ego thinks that if you have done bad

01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:42.240
work or good work we have to suffer.

01:13:43.110 --> 01:13:45.170
You see, a tiger doesn’t feel that way.

01:13:46.030 --> 01:13:48.200
If tiger has to eat, it must kill.

01:13:49.020 --> 01:13:51.220
It kills the animal, eats it, finished.

01:13:52.080 --> 01:13:54.180
It doesn’t sit down and sulk, “Oh, God, I shouldn’t have

01:13:55.020 --> 01:14:00.120
done it. I should become vegetarian.”

01:14:00.220 --> 01:14:05.040
It doesn’t accumulate any, any, any karmas in it,

01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:07.180
all right? But we human beings do. Why?

01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:10.030
Because we are closed.

01:14:10.120 --> 01:14:12.170
We are closed. See here, we are closed.

01:14:13.030 --> 01:14:14.050
They are open.

01:14:14.130 --> 01:14:16.060
Whatever they do, they are not bothered.

01:14:16.060 --> 01:14:18.070
But we are bothered about what we do

01:14:18.130 --> 01:14:20.140
because we think we do.

01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:27.080
And when, as I said, this center is opened out

01:14:27.170 --> 01:14:30.070
He sucks our karmas, and the so-called karmas are

01:14:30.150 --> 01:14:33.000
nothing but sins, you see –

01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:36.140
in a biblical language we can call it as sin, you see.

01:14:36.220 --> 01:14:39.110
And they’re all sucked in

01:14:40.200 --> 01:14:45.240
by this powerful Deity of Christ awakened within us.

01:14:45.240 --> 01:14:47.130
And you get beyond it because

01:14:47.210 --> 01:14:49.180
it is the ego that does the karma.

01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:53.090
When your ego is finished, where are the karmas?

01:14:53.170 --> 01:14:56.020
They are finished, too.

01:15:00.120 --> 01:15:02.220
Then you don’t say, “I did it.”

01:15:03.050 --> 01:15:06.050
What you will say, “Mother, it’s not working out.

01:15:06.150 --> 01:15:08.130
It’s not going up.” Now what is this “it” –

01:15:08.210 --> 01:15:11.200
it becomes a third person. “It’s flowing.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.100
The vibrations not coming.”

01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:16.190
You see, you don’t say, “I, I am doing this Realization.

01:15:17.030 --> 01:15:19.180
I am raising the kunda ..”, they don’t say so.

01:15:20.040 --> 01:15:25.110
They say, “It’s not rising.” You become a third person.

01:15:25.200 --> 01:15:27.220
That third person is the Spirit.

01:15:28.070 --> 01:15:31.050
Where you do not say that “I should do it.”

01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.030
Even if it’s your son, you say,

01:15:33.100 --> 01:15:35.050
“Mother, it’s better he gets Realization.”

01:15:35.150 --> 01:15:39.020
All right. You’ll see. Try it. It didn’t work out?

01:15:39.120 --> 01:15:41.220
All right, then should I give a certificate?

01:15:42.060 --> 01:15:43.110
He said, “How can You give certificate,

01:15:43.210 --> 01:15:46.080
Mother, how can anybody, Kundalini has not risen.”

01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:48.120
Everyone knows, you see, whether it’s your father,

01:15:48.210 --> 01:15:50.040
mother, sister - anyone –

01:15:50.140 --> 01:15:52.090
if they’re not realized, they know they’re not realized,

01:15:52.170 --> 01:15:56.190
so what. They just know.

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:00.000
This granddaughter of Mine, who was …

01:16:00.070 --> 01:16:03.120
she’s here now, she is a born realized,

01:16:03.120 --> 01:16:05.100
and she was hardly about five years of age, I think,

01:16:05.170 --> 01:16:06.240
when they went to Ladakh.

01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.160
There was one lama sitting with a shaved head and all

01:16:09.230 --> 01:16:11.100
that, wearing and all that.

01:16:11.180 --> 01:16:14.000
Everybody was touching his feet, and the parents also

01:16:14.110 --> 01:16:16.230
not realized, my daughter is not realized, so she also

01:16:17.060 --> 01:16:18.000
touched his feet.

01:16:18.110 --> 01:16:19.140
She couldn’t bear it anymore now,

01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:20.180
it was too much for her.

01:16:21.090 --> 01:16:23.070
She was sitting in a higher block, she went,

01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:26.030
put her hands back and looked at him, you see, told him.

01:16:26.210 --> 01:16:29.010
She says, “What do you mean by asking everybody to

01:16:29.090 --> 01:16:33.030
touch your feet? You’re not a even a realized soul.

01:16:33.130 --> 01:16:36.020
By wearing this dress of yours and shaving your head

01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:39.060
you think you can ask people to touch your feet?”

01:16:39.140 --> 01:16:44.060
Little child of five years, yet she understands.

01:16:44.150 --> 01:16:47.120
We had once a program in India when they invited Me

01:16:47.200 --> 01:16:50.070
as a chief guest and for this Ramanmash?,

01:16:50.150 --> 01:16:54.020
she was a realized soul; and one gentleman from

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.020
Ramkrishna ashram from the head of that was sitting

01:16:56.140 --> 01:17:01.070
with his big orange robe, you see, sitting there.

01:17:01.130 --> 01:17:03.040
And my, another granddaughter,

01:17:03.130 --> 01:17:05.010
she was sitting in the front row.

01:17:05.100 --> 01:17:06.130
She couldn’t bear him anymore

01:17:06.210 --> 01:17:08.030
so she shouted from there,

01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:12.050
“Mother, the one whose wearing a maxi dress,

01:17:12.120 --> 01:17:14.000
Grandmother, please ask him to get out,

01:17:14.080 --> 01:17:15.240
he’s giving heat to all of us.”

01:17:16.050 --> 01:17:17.180
So you see, there were many Sahaj Yogis who were

01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:19.150
feeling the heat from this fellow and he thinks he’s a

01:17:20.010 --> 01:17:20.240
very spiritual man.

01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:24.020
She said, “Ask him to go, he’s wearing a maxi.”

01:17:24.200 --> 01:17:26.200
She didn’t understand it was a robe or thing.

01:17:27.020 --> 01:17:29.080
Even children know

01:17:29.170 --> 01:17:31.220
who are realized souls and who are not,

01:17:32.050 --> 01:17:33.100
if they are born realized.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:35.130
There are many children who are born realized these days.

01:17:35.190 --> 01:17:40.000
The time of judgment, this is the time of judgment.

01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:42.240
Of course about this I’ll tell you later.

01:17:48.080 --> 01:17:50.090
Do You mind if I ask You a few questions?

01:17:50.210 --> 01:17:52.140
It’s all right, I don’t mind.

01:17:52.230 --> 01:17:54.100
But what happens, if you ask too many questions

01:17:54.190 --> 01:17:58.090
sometimes it becomes mental activity and may delay

01:17:58.190 --> 01:18:00.140
further Realization sometimes,

01:18:00.230 --> 01:18:03.150
so I would advice you, if it is not so important, better

01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:06.100
keep it out because, you see, answering the question is

01:18:06.190 --> 01:18:08.020
only on mental level.

01:18:08.110 --> 01:18:10.040
I’m talking something much beyond, you see.

01:18:10.180 --> 01:18:14.010
So, it is something logically if you have understood Me -

01:18:14.080 --> 01:18:15.210
all right, let’s have it.

01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:17.240
If it will work out, work out. If it will not work out,

01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:19.020
doesn’t matter.

01:18:19.090 --> 01:18:22.180
I’m here for three-four days, and we are going to work it

01:18:23.020 --> 01:18:24.100
out. All right?

01:18:24.240 --> 01:18:26.160
So it’s better to keep your mind at rest. Tell the mind,

01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:28.210
“You have asked many questions before,

01:18:29.140 --> 01:18:32.200
you have thought of many things, now the time for you

01:18:33.100 --> 01:18:39.050
to receive the blessings of your own being.” All right?

01:18:39.150 --> 01:18:41.000
If you tell your mind, it will rest.

01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.170
It’s a, it’s a wonderful thing mind is.

01:18:45.010 --> 01:18:50.030
If the mind knows what you want, and if it is the reality,

01:18:50.120 --> 01:18:53.060
it supports you and helps you very much.

01:18:53.150 --> 01:18:56.080
The same mind which can go astray, you see,

01:18:56.160 --> 01:18:58.170
it’s like sometimes I say it’s like a donkey,

01:18:59.090 --> 01:19:04.130
like Christ used donkey just to suggest the mind

01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:10.140
that if you allow it to go astray it will take you to all

01:19:10.220 --> 01:19:14.050
kinds of things, but if you control it, it takes you there

01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:17.040
where you have to go.

01:19:17.190 --> 01:19:20.020
You just make him keep quiet.

01:19:20.100 --> 01:19:23.100
It’s better to keep quiet at mind level.

01:19:23.190 --> 01:19:26.050
And that’s why I answered your questions because later

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:29.090
on when the Kundalini’s rising, at that time,

01:19:29.190 --> 01:19:31.160
the mind should not stand up, isn’t it, to say that

01:19:32.010 --> 01:19:34.050
“I haven’t asked this question.” That’s why.

01:19:34.130 --> 01:19:36.090
Just to soothe it – there’s no need –

01:19:36.180 --> 01:19:39.230
but, just to soothe it down, I do it. All right?

01:19:40.070 --> 01:19:42.090
So best thing is to get your Realization is the best thing,

01:19:42.170 --> 01:19:45.030
otherwise this mind is quite a disturbing stuff.

01:19:45.110 --> 01:19:47.160
It can come at the right time when you are going to

01:19:47.240 --> 01:19:52.100
achieve your last breakthrough, it may stop. All right?

01:19:52.170 --> 01:19:55.170
So if you have any immediate question by which you are

01:19:56.000 --> 01:19:57.170
really oppressed then you must ask Me.

01:19:58.040 --> 01:20:00.050
But if it is not so important, just give up.

01:20:00.120 --> 01:20:01.230
Is it very important?

01:20:01.230 --> 01:20:04.030
Then it’s all right. He has realized.
