00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.871
This is the first time we are having a puja in Brisbane,

00:04:16.831 --> 00:04:19.831
and I'm happy so many have come here

00:04:19.911 --> 00:04:22.151
from various places.

00:04:25.911 --> 00:04:27.751
You know that by puja you,

00:04:27.871 --> 00:04:31.751
you excite the Chakras within Me

00:04:33.031 --> 00:04:36.911
and you get lots of vibrations,

00:04:38.911 --> 00:04:40.991
and you achieve,

00:04:41.311 --> 00:04:44.631
suddenly, a height in your awareness.

00:04:47.791 --> 00:04:49.791
You do achieve that, but

00:04:51.151 --> 00:04:53.671
after some time they say that:

00:04:53.791 --> 00:04:56.231
Mother, again we come down.

00:04:57.231 --> 00:04:59.311
Also, they were saying that:

00:04:59.631 --> 00:05:02.511
"When we go to India we are all right,

00:05:02.591 --> 00:05:05.591
and when we come back, again we come down."

00:05:07.991 --> 00:05:09.831
Luckily, now we have an Ashram,

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:11.511
which is a very good thing.

00:05:11.591 --> 00:05:14.711
To have an ashram itself is a, I must say,

00:05:14.791 --> 00:05:16.431
is a very, very

00:05:18.311 --> 00:05:19.831
positive thing because

00:05:19.911 --> 00:05:22.631
that is how Ganesha is established here.

00:05:28.871 --> 00:05:31.751
So Ashram is here for a collective living,

00:05:34.591 --> 00:05:38.631
but a collective living of spirituality.

00:05:39.551 --> 00:05:43.471
It's not just living here, but it is of spirituality.

00:05:44.631 --> 00:05:49.471
And we have to know certain things about

00:05:49.951 --> 00:05:51.911
the discipline that we have to keep,

00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:54.431
which is very important.

00:05:54.591 --> 00:05:56.751
It's not just a house where are, some people

00:05:56.911 --> 00:05:59.271
have gathered together to live together,

00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:03.311
but it has to have a discipline.

00:06:06.551 --> 00:06:08.911
Then only you'll be helped

00:06:08.991 --> 00:06:11.431
because if you do not come

00:06:11.511 --> 00:06:13.911
to the Ashram with this idea

00:06:13.991 --> 00:06:17.071
that you are going there to ascend yourself,

00:06:19.071 --> 00:06:20.711
it will make no difference

00:06:20.791 --> 00:06:21.831
whether you stay in the house

00:06:21.911 --> 00:06:23.911
or you go in the Ashram.

00:06:29.631 --> 00:06:32.791
So there are two types of meditation,

00:06:33.991 --> 00:06:35.511
two types,

00:06:36.071 --> 00:06:39.511
where one is the meditation where -

00:06:40.471 --> 00:06:42.711
we can call it the antarmana -

00:06:42.791 --> 00:06:45.311
that we meditate inside ourselves,

00:06:46.791 --> 00:06:50.071
to see for ourselves what's wrong with us,

00:06:50.911 --> 00:06:52.711
and how we have to correct,

00:06:52.791 --> 00:06:54.391
what we have to do about it.

00:06:55.151 --> 00:06:57.951
And another is bahir mana,

00:06:58.391 --> 00:07:00.391
which is outside,

00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:03.711
how we have to live outside.

00:07:03.791 --> 00:07:06.071
You have to have a discipline,

00:07:06.151 --> 00:07:08.791
which is not imposed on you

00:07:09.111 --> 00:07:11.391
but, very happily,

00:07:11.551 --> 00:07:13.351
which you have

00:07:15.911 --> 00:07:17.671
accepted

00:07:18.311 --> 00:07:20.351
and have imbibed.

00:07:23.151 --> 00:07:27.551
For any art, say in India, I don't know here, but

00:07:27.791 --> 00:07:33.671
you have to put yourself into a rigorous training

00:07:33.751 --> 00:07:36.751
to achieve any height.

00:07:38.311 --> 00:07:41.191
You cannot haphazardly move about it.

00:07:42.231 --> 00:07:45.711
You cannot take just easily everything.

00:07:46.431 --> 00:07:48.751
In Sahaja Yoga there is no tapascharya,

00:07:48.831 --> 00:07:51.391
there is no penance for you.

00:07:51.551 --> 00:07:53.191
It's all blessings.

00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:56.871
But one should not get lost with those blessings,

00:07:57.191 --> 00:08:00.271
if you have to really get into yourself

00:08:00.551 --> 00:08:02.871
in its full depth.

00:08:05.431 --> 00:08:10.831
So, for the antarmana it is important

00:08:10.911 --> 00:08:13.791
that you all should meditate,

00:08:13.871 --> 00:08:17.351
morning and evening, every day.

00:08:17.591 --> 00:08:21.511
Is all right even if you do not brush your teeth,

00:08:22.991 --> 00:08:26.751
but you must meditate is an important thing.

00:08:27.791 --> 00:08:30.711
That is the reason I find that in the West

00:08:30.831 --> 00:08:32.711
people go on catching,

00:08:32.791 --> 00:08:34.751
again cleaning, again catching.

00:08:34.831 --> 00:08:38.431
Every time I come... [I] find somebody is suffering

00:08:38.511 --> 00:08:40.911
from either... for some sort of a conditioning,

00:08:40.991 --> 00:08:43.351
or say, some sort of a baddha,

00:08:43.431 --> 00:08:46.871
or sometimes it's ego or something.

00:08:46.991 --> 00:08:48.831
It comes and goes.

00:08:48.911 --> 00:08:55.271
It is not something that is detached permanently.

00:08:57.791 --> 00:08:59.991
As we have to take our bath every day,

00:09:00.071 --> 00:09:03.031
we have to wash ourselves every day,

00:09:03.111 --> 00:09:06.751
in the same way we have to wash ourselves within.

00:09:06.831 --> 00:09:10.791
So meditation is the antarmana

00:09:12.231 --> 00:09:14.271
tapaha, as you can call it.

00:09:14.351 --> 00:09:16.511
But it's not such a Tapaha even.

00:09:16.591 --> 00:09:19.711
You don't have to go to Himalayas and sit there.

00:09:20.031 --> 00:09:23.351
You have to just do this meditation

00:09:24.951 --> 00:09:27.031
early in the morning.

00:09:27.431 --> 00:09:31.031
In the Sahaja Yoga system,

00:09:31.991 --> 00:09:35.511
I would say the best that is working out

00:09:35.591 --> 00:09:38.791
is in Germany and in Austria, these two;

00:09:40.311 --> 00:09:42.591
and also England, but not to that extent.

00:09:42.671 --> 00:09:46.031
I would say these two are working out the best;

00:09:46.111 --> 00:09:49.591
and thirdly, in Rome.

00:09:50.471 --> 00:09:53.751
They too have ashrams of the same kind,

00:09:55.271 --> 00:09:59.831
but for them it is very important to achieve

00:10:00.151 --> 00:10:02.231
the heights of Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:02.311 --> 00:10:05.551
Absolutely. Nothing is more important.

00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.751
Invariably, in all these ashrams

00:10:07.831 --> 00:10:09.591
I've seen people get up at four o'clock.

00:10:09.671 --> 00:10:11.991
I also get up every day at four.

00:10:12.071 --> 00:10:13.831
Then I may sleep later on,

00:10:13.911 --> 00:10:16.151
but at four o'clock I am up.

00:10:16.231 --> 00:10:18.271
They take their baths,

00:10:18.431 --> 00:10:20.991
get ready for the pujas,

00:10:21.991 --> 00:10:23.911
and then sit down and do about

00:10:24.071 --> 00:10:27.631
five, ten minutes puja of the photograph,

00:10:28.551 --> 00:10:30.471
and then meditate.

00:10:32.071 --> 00:10:35.111
Then they go and have some breakfast or something.

00:10:38.031 --> 00:10:43.551
Then when they come home from work,

00:10:45.071 --> 00:10:49.111
also they sit down together to meditate,

00:10:49.191 --> 00:10:51.591
that's the collective part of it,

00:10:51.831 --> 00:10:53.831
or discuss whatever is to be done, what,

00:10:53.911 --> 00:10:56.591
how are we to propagate Sahaja Yoga.

00:10:56.671 --> 00:10:59.391
They just talk about Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:59.911 --> 00:11:01.951
or they decide what should be done,

00:11:02.031 --> 00:11:03.791
what is the best way

00:11:03.871 --> 00:11:06.791
to solve the problems of Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:09.671 --> 00:11:11.911
And then in the night, before sleeping,

00:11:11.991 --> 00:11:14.911
invariably all of them,  all of them,

00:11:14.991 --> 00:11:17.591
one and all, even children before sleeping,

00:11:18.271 --> 00:11:21.151
soak their feet in the water,

00:11:21.231 --> 00:11:23.791
sit for meditation, and sleep.

00:11:24.711 --> 00:11:29.111
That's why I find Austria has come up so well,

00:11:29.991 --> 00:11:32.551
and Germans.

00:11:32.631 --> 00:11:34.791
You know, Germans are like that.

00:11:34.991 --> 00:11:37.511
If something gets into their heads,

00:11:37.791 --> 00:11:40.711
for them that's the most important thing;

00:11:40.791 --> 00:11:42.751
then they do not sort of fickle out.

00:11:42.831 --> 00:11:43.831
There's no...

00:11:43.911 --> 00:11:46.791
they don't have any compromises on those points.

00:11:46.911 --> 00:11:49.511
And they make their body work hard.

00:11:49.671 --> 00:11:52.511
Now, what is the Tapa in this thing here

00:11:52.991 --> 00:11:54.351
- the penance?

00:11:54.431 --> 00:11:58.791
That our body is used to some sort of a life.

00:11:58.871 --> 00:12:00.831
India also, we are all like that in India

00:12:00.911 --> 00:12:03.071
- everybody will get up in the morning,

00:12:03.151 --> 00:12:05.031
and they will sit for puja,

00:12:05.111 --> 00:12:06.711
or they will sit for meditation.

00:12:06.791 --> 00:12:07.991
I mean, that goes without saying,

00:12:08.071 --> 00:12:10.151
you don't have to tell them.

00:12:10.831 --> 00:12:13.671
Because that's the traditional thing to do in India:

00:12:13.751 --> 00:12:16.071
always when they get up, have their bath,

00:12:16.151 --> 00:12:18.511
they always do some puja,

00:12:19.231 --> 00:12:20.631
all of them.

00:12:21.471 --> 00:12:24.711
If they're Christians, also, they'll sit down and pray.

00:12:26.151 --> 00:12:28.191
Muslims, they'll do Namaz.

00:12:28.271 --> 00:12:30.911
That's a kind of a practice,

00:12:31.151 --> 00:12:34.471
and the breeding of the family.

00:12:35.591 --> 00:12:37.231
Here I find that the parents

00:12:37.311 --> 00:12:38.911
do not take the responsibility

00:12:38.991 --> 00:12:42.311
to pass on any information to children

00:12:42.391 --> 00:12:44.391
about disciplining themselves,

00:12:44.471 --> 00:12:47.031
because children are also extremely aggressive.

00:12:49.471 --> 00:12:51.991
They don't want to know about it.

00:12:53.351 --> 00:12:55.711
So the parents also dare not tell them

00:12:55.791 --> 00:12:57.951
that: "It is good for you, please do it this way;

00:12:58.031 --> 00:13:00.591
it is better that you meditate."

00:13:03.271 --> 00:13:05.551
They're afraid that they may lose their children

00:13:05.631 --> 00:13:07.111
if they tell them like this.

00:13:07.191 --> 00:13:09.831
Or, "You pray", or "You get up at this time".

00:13:09.911 --> 00:13:12.831
You dare not tell them that you get up at this time.

00:13:12.911 --> 00:13:15.551
This is the greatest crime in the West

00:13:15.631 --> 00:13:16.711
if you tell them that:

00:13:16.791 --> 00:13:19.471
"You have to get up at four o'clock" - amah!

00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:22.391
It's like the worst punishment.

00:13:25.511 --> 00:13:28.311
But once you start getting up in the morning,

00:13:28.391 --> 00:13:31.751
you'll get the habit, and then you'll sleep early.

00:13:36.911 --> 00:13:38.711
Then you can sleep early.

00:13:38.791 --> 00:13:40.711
Getting up in the morning, really,

00:13:40.791 --> 00:13:43.031
will help you for the whole day.

00:13:43.111 --> 00:13:46.591
So start this kind of a practice.

00:13:47.071 --> 00:13:49.591
You must meditate every day,

00:13:49.671 --> 00:13:52.591
and this is the reason why I find people,

00:13:53.071 --> 00:13:55.191
whenever I come, they're again caught up,

00:13:55.271 --> 00:13:56.271
something gone wrong.

00:13:56.351 --> 00:13:57.871
This is wrong, that is wrong;

00:13:57.951 --> 00:14:01.311
they're caught up here and there. Why should you?

00:14:01.671 --> 00:14:04.391
Day by day, you must rise.

00:14:04.511 --> 00:14:08.311
Day by day, you should be at a much higher state,

00:14:08.831 --> 00:14:12.751
and this new breeding has to come within us,

00:14:12.831 --> 00:14:14.911
that we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:14:16.191 --> 00:14:18.231
And we are not here only,

00:14:18.311 --> 00:14:24.591
just to have good food and to have a nice time

00:14:24.711 --> 00:14:28.511
or nice meetings, but we are here

00:14:28.631 --> 00:14:34.671
to become those unique personalities,

00:14:34.751 --> 00:14:38.591
which are required to raise the humanity

00:14:38.671 --> 00:14:40.791
to a higher state.

00:14:41.951 --> 00:14:45.751
So you have to be, now, responsible for yourself.

00:14:46.591 --> 00:14:49.191
You have to look after yourself

00:14:49.311 --> 00:14:51.231
and you have to tell yourself:

00:14:51.391 --> 00:14:53.551
"Mr. So-and-so, Mrs. So-and-so,

00:14:53.631 --> 00:14:55.631
please now behave yourself."

00:14:56.991 --> 00:14:59.671
Otherwise, Sahaja Yoga is lost to you.

00:15:00.071 --> 00:15:02.391
It's not going to help you much.

00:15:03.911 --> 00:15:08.831
We might increase in quantity,

00:15:08.911 --> 00:15:11.631
but quality-wise we'll be missing;

00:15:12.151 --> 00:15:15.831
and one attack of negativity can finish

00:15:15.911 --> 00:15:18.991
such a quantity that we think is too much

00:15:19.071 --> 00:15:21.351
- it has happened once.

00:15:23.631 --> 00:15:26.631
So now, all of you must develop

00:15:27.231 --> 00:15:32.071
that dedication to yourself,

00:15:34.151 --> 00:15:37.831
to find out what's your problem,

00:15:38.711 --> 00:15:41.551
and how you have to correct it.

00:15:43.071 --> 00:15:46.711
If it is done every day, I can assure you,

00:15:46.791 --> 00:15:49.911
you will have no problem of any kind.

00:15:50.511 --> 00:15:52.991
Your thoughts will stop,

00:15:54.471 --> 00:15:57.191
your problems will be solved,

00:15:59.311 --> 00:16:01.831
and you'll have no catches at all,

00:16:01.911 --> 00:16:03.751
because you have washed them off.

00:16:03.831 --> 00:16:06.071
But if you leave them on your being,

00:16:06.151 --> 00:16:09.751
then they grow, and they become big.

00:16:11.471 --> 00:16:13.791
So there should be no lethargy,

00:16:13.871 --> 00:16:16.551
as far as meditation is concerned,

00:16:16.631 --> 00:16:20.431
but joyfully you'll start doing, after some time.

00:16:20.591 --> 00:16:23.631
You won't be happy if you have not done it.

00:16:23.711 --> 00:16:26.191
But in the beginning you'll have to goad yourself,

00:16:26.271 --> 00:16:28.031
and tell yourself

00:16:28.111 --> 00:16:33.511
that this body has to be cleaned;

00:16:33.591 --> 00:16:36.151
but more than that body,

00:16:36.351 --> 00:16:39.431
this mind and intellect, both of them,

00:16:39.551 --> 00:16:42.031
are to be corrected.

00:16:42.831 --> 00:16:45.591
To be an instrument of God,

00:16:45.671 --> 00:16:47.711
you have to be perfect,

00:16:47.991 --> 00:16:49.991
perfect personality,

00:16:50.071 --> 00:16:52.751
otherwise we may not be able to communicate

00:16:52.831 --> 00:16:56.551
the message of Sahaja Yoga in the proper way.

00:16:58.111 --> 00:16:59.711
Many people say that:

00:16:59.791 --> 00:17:02.511
"We are surrendered to Mother,

00:17:02.791 --> 00:17:04.751
and we are surrendered to Her,

00:17:04.831 --> 00:17:07.911
and as surrendering we'll get everything."

00:17:09.231 --> 00:17:11.671
But what are you surrendering?

00:17:11.751 --> 00:17:14.111
Is that a clean heart,

00:17:14.191 --> 00:17:18.751
or a heart full of all kinds of wrong things?

00:17:22.991 --> 00:17:25.151
Or is that the intelligence,

00:17:25.231 --> 00:17:28.951
which is a very superior type of clean intelligence?

00:17:29.031 --> 00:17:32.791
Or else, are you coming out

00:17:32.871 --> 00:17:35.671
with all your arrogance?

00:17:39.271 --> 00:17:43.751
So though there is the Ganges of Sahaja Yoga flowing,

00:17:45.151 --> 00:17:49.911
still you have to have the depth of a pitcher.

00:17:50.111 --> 00:17:53.791
A stone cannot fetch any water.

00:17:56.031 --> 00:17:57.991
Same with children.

00:17:58.151 --> 00:18:00.151
Of course, as they'll be going to India,

00:18:00.231 --> 00:18:02.871
I am sure they'll form proper routines,

00:18:03.031 --> 00:18:07.751
and they'll form proper meditation methods.

00:18:11.271 --> 00:18:14.471
It is obvious that we have never had

00:18:14.551 --> 00:18:18.511
the sense of Divinity in the West.

00:18:18.591 --> 00:18:21.151
Whatever we had, whatever we got

00:18:21.231 --> 00:18:23.831
from the church or from any

00:18:24.431 --> 00:18:26.951
synagogue or something like that,

00:18:27.231 --> 00:18:29.791
which was only Sunday to Sunday, Sunday to Sunday;

00:18:29.991 --> 00:18:33.031
for a Muslim it is Friday to Friday, Friday to Friday,

00:18:34.071 --> 00:18:35.831
finished.

00:18:37.071 --> 00:18:39.751
But that has led them nowhere.

00:18:40.191 --> 00:18:42.991
So we have to do something about it.

00:18:44.031 --> 00:18:47.111
Problems will be solved in no time.

00:18:47.511 --> 00:18:50.031
You don't have to sit down and contemplate

00:18:50.111 --> 00:18:52.071
and worry: how will you solve your problem?

00:18:52.151 --> 00:18:54.071
It will be solved.

00:18:54.151 --> 00:18:55.911
But what cannot be solved

00:18:55.991 --> 00:18:59.071
is the habits you have developed,

00:18:59.151 --> 00:19:02.391
habits of lethargy.

00:19:03.551 --> 00:19:05.671
I can understand in London

00:19:05.791 --> 00:19:08.431
if the people are lethargic, but they are not.

00:19:08.911 --> 00:19:10.831
They have become extremely,

00:19:10.911 --> 00:19:14.791
extremely hardworking,

00:19:15.431 --> 00:19:17.111
active,

00:19:17.191 --> 00:19:19.471
and also dedicated.

00:19:19.551 --> 00:19:22.271
How they have achieved it?

00:19:23.831 --> 00:19:28.551
Only by knowing that this dedication brings forth

00:19:29.231 --> 00:19:31.911
all the cleansing, and all the powers.

00:19:31.991 --> 00:19:35.111
Now, supposing this instrument is not clean.

00:19:35.231 --> 00:19:38.231
You won't be able to even hear Me,

00:19:38.311 --> 00:19:40.111
it is useless.

00:19:40.831 --> 00:19:45.671
So our instrument has to be perfect

00:19:46.791 --> 00:19:50.711
to manifest Sahaja Yoga.

00:19:50.791 --> 00:19:55.231
If it is not, all the defects can have double effects;

00:19:55.311 --> 00:19:58.911
like, first it will affect you,

00:19:59.511 --> 00:20:05.031
you can never feel the full advantage of Sahaja Yoga,

00:20:05.151 --> 00:20:08.431
and secondly it will affect the people who will meet you,

00:20:08.511 --> 00:20:10.191
and gradually they'll find out

00:20:10.271 --> 00:20:12.991
there's something wrong with you.

00:20:13.791 --> 00:20:16.751
"Some sort of a subdued madness",

00:20:16.831 --> 00:20:19.191
they'll say, "this Sahaja Yoga is,

00:20:19.271 --> 00:20:22.711
because I don't find anything great about this man.

00:20:22.871 --> 00:20:25.951
He's halfway here and halfway there."

00:20:29.391 --> 00:20:33.551
Once you start getting deeper into your being,

00:20:33.631 --> 00:20:37.151
you'll be amazed that you can develop

00:20:37.231 --> 00:20:39.591
such capacities

00:20:40.831 --> 00:20:45.711
that you will be amazed at yourself.

00:20:47.831 --> 00:20:51.071
Of course, there are blessings, there are miracles,

00:20:51.151 --> 00:20:54.391
but think of your own capacities.

00:20:59.231 --> 00:21:02.111
What are your capacities?

00:21:03.231 --> 00:21:06.991
How far are you able to do

00:21:07.151 --> 00:21:11.031
something about curing people?

00:21:13.231 --> 00:21:15.551
We have few people in Bombay,

00:21:15.631 --> 00:21:18.231
and very few people in Pune also.

00:21:18.711 --> 00:21:21.711
But they are available for curing.

00:21:22.071 --> 00:21:26.631
Some of them are going to villages.

00:21:26.791 --> 00:21:31.191
Now they have asked Me to give them a jeep,

00:21:31.471 --> 00:21:34.911
so they could take a music party to the villages

00:21:35.071 --> 00:21:37.551
and sing there,

00:21:39.711 --> 00:21:42.031
and achieve

00:21:43.191 --> 00:21:46.271
a greater number of Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:46.431 --> 00:21:49.471
But when they come back, immediately,

00:21:49.551 --> 00:21:52.351
whether they come in the daytime or in the night,

00:21:52.431 --> 00:21:54.831
immediately they wash their feet

00:21:54.911 --> 00:21:56.911
before the photograph.

00:21:58.511 --> 00:22:00.991
Also to protect yourself,

00:22:01.071 --> 00:22:03.711
you have to give yourself a bandhan,

00:22:03.791 --> 00:22:04.711
all the time.

00:22:04.791 --> 00:22:06.831
It is not you should say: "Now, I'm all right."

00:22:06.911 --> 00:22:08.911
You should not say that: "I am perfect."

00:22:08.991 --> 00:22:10.911
You should not say: "Now I'm a Sahaja Yogi."

00:22:10.991 --> 00:22:12.711
Never, never think like that.

00:22:12.791 --> 00:22:14.911
The moment you start thinking you are perfect,

00:22:14.991 --> 00:22:16.911
you are finished.

00:22:19.391 --> 00:22:23.191
So before going out, you must give a proper bandhan.

00:22:23.591 --> 00:22:26.591
Also before sleeping you must give a proper bandhan.

00:22:26.871 --> 00:22:30.791
Put your attention to your Sahasrara and then sleep.

00:22:33.631 --> 00:22:36.751
It's very amazing how things work out.

00:22:37.391 --> 00:22:39.911
Immediately you will know a person

00:22:39.991 --> 00:22:43.711
is meditating or not, immediately.

00:22:44.471 --> 00:22:46.951
It's like he is a person who

00:22:47.111 --> 00:22:50.111
has given a bath to the child.

00:22:53.151 --> 00:22:55.831
Though he has given a bath to the child,

00:22:55.911 --> 00:22:57.271
still he has not taken a bath.

00:22:57.351 --> 00:22:59.991
You can make it out, the difference between the two.

00:23:01.791 --> 00:23:04.831
In the same way, those who have been meditating

00:23:04.911 --> 00:23:07.151
every day, morning and evening,

00:23:07.231 --> 00:23:08.751
not much time needed.

00:23:08.831 --> 00:23:10.311
You see, we waste all our time

00:23:10.391 --> 00:23:12.071
in something nonsensical.

00:23:15.391 --> 00:23:21.391
When there is complete understanding of yourself,

00:23:21.591 --> 00:23:25.471
and complete understanding of these vibrations,

00:23:26.991 --> 00:23:32.671
then only you can handle them properly.

00:23:32.871 --> 00:23:35.551
All this knowledge is for you.

00:23:36.191 --> 00:23:38.711
Is absolutely free as you know,

00:23:38.791 --> 00:23:41.991
and all this mastery can be yours.

00:23:42.071 --> 00:23:43.831
So do not just get satisfied:

00:23:43.911 --> 00:23:47.391
"All right, today's Sunday, we'll go to the church,

00:23:49.071 --> 00:23:52.711
take the hymn book, let us sing this hymn number

00:23:52.791 --> 00:23:55.791
such-and-such, again sit down, get up, sit down."

00:23:57.631 --> 00:24:00.591
Come back home just the same.

00:24:02.351 --> 00:24:08.071
So today I have really thought of telling all of you

00:24:08.151 --> 00:24:12.471
that you have to develop the depth within yourself.

00:24:15.711 --> 00:24:19.271
And if you cannot develop that depth,

00:24:19.351 --> 00:24:22.751
then you are still a mediocre.

00:24:24.631 --> 00:24:30.191
Actually all these great secrets about the Goddess

00:24:30.271 --> 00:24:34.471
or Her powers, were not told to anyone like that.

00:24:34.791 --> 00:24:36.071
Never.

00:24:37.151 --> 00:24:43.071
Only when they had completed their oneness

00:24:44.431 --> 00:24:49.351
- I would say the full idea, full understanding

00:24:49.791 --> 00:24:52.711
between the oneness of God

00:24:52.791 --> 00:24:55.831
and your relationship with that,

00:24:56.791 --> 00:24:59.151
absolutely –

00:25:00.271 --> 00:25:04.391
nobody would do anything before that.

00:25:06.711 --> 00:25:10.351
Now the days are, of Sahaja Yoga, are so simple

00:25:10.511 --> 00:25:12.831
that as soon as you get Realization,

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:15.791
you can start giving Realization to others.

00:25:16.231 --> 00:25:17.951
Immediately.

00:25:18.511 --> 00:25:19.911
Just under your hand you will see

00:25:19.991 --> 00:25:21.551
the Kundalini will move.

00:25:21.631 --> 00:25:23.111
You put your hand on somebody's head,

00:25:23.191 --> 00:25:26.071
and you'll find that person gets realization.

00:25:28.671 --> 00:25:30.111
It's a fact.

00:25:30.191 --> 00:25:32.511
It just works that way.

00:25:32.591 --> 00:25:35.551
But that means, for many:

00:25:35.631 --> 00:25:37.511
"Oh, there's nothing to be done.

00:25:37.591 --> 00:25:38.951
After all, is all done by Mother,

00:25:39.031 --> 00:25:41.351
we have just achieved something."

00:25:43.791 --> 00:25:46.991
You can always understand that

00:25:47.071 --> 00:25:50.711
Mother can only work out a very good instrument,

00:25:51.831 --> 00:25:54.311
and not a weak instrument.

00:25:54.591 --> 00:26:01.551
So now, we have some very great Sahaja Yogis

00:26:01.831 --> 00:26:04.671
who have gone very deep into it.

00:26:04.791 --> 00:26:07.671
Invariably, whenever I asked,

00:26:07.751 --> 00:26:09.831
they say: "Mother, every day we worship.

00:26:09.911 --> 00:26:13.471
We worship morning and evening, every way, day.

00:26:13.551 --> 00:26:15.831
We either wash our feet

00:26:15.911 --> 00:26:17.711
and sit down before Your photograph

00:26:17.791 --> 00:26:19.631
and worship Your photograph,

00:26:19.711 --> 00:26:22.231
or else in the morning time also

00:26:22.311 --> 00:26:24.911
we do something like that."

00:26:24.991 --> 00:26:29.271
And amazingly, you can make them out immediately.

00:26:31.031 --> 00:26:34.991
There may be six hundred people at the airport,

00:26:37.511 --> 00:26:39.431
but immediately I know

00:26:39.511 --> 00:26:42.871
who has been meditating every day.

00:26:47.751 --> 00:26:51.151
Now, it is for us.

00:26:51.231 --> 00:26:54.231
We have been doing Sahaja Yoga for the last,

00:26:54.311 --> 00:26:56.751
now, more than twenty years,

00:26:57.231 --> 00:26:59.751
and now we are entering into twenty-first year,

00:26:59.831 --> 00:27:02.831
we can say; but I'm ready, you see, it is like that,

00:27:02.911 --> 00:27:07.791
because now it was 1970, and now it is 1990,

00:27:08.311 --> 00:27:12.351
so it is all this thing, plus ninety-one.

00:27:15.591 --> 00:27:17.711
So much time we have had.

00:27:17.791 --> 00:27:18.951
Of course, I would say,

00:27:19.031 --> 00:27:21.871
you didn't get your Realization at that time;

00:27:21.951 --> 00:27:26.071
but whatever time you got the Realization,

00:27:27.591 --> 00:27:30.911
I did not judge how far you were in it.

00:27:30.991 --> 00:27:33.831
I said: "First let them have their Realization."

00:27:33.911 --> 00:27:36.471
They got their Realization.

00:27:36.791 --> 00:27:39.551
So once they got their Realization, you see,

00:27:39.991 --> 00:27:43.471
people who have really

00:27:46.071 --> 00:27:48.911
felt the responsibility,

00:27:48.991 --> 00:27:51.151
from the very first day they got to it,

00:27:51.231 --> 00:27:52.471
from the very first day.

00:27:52.551 --> 00:27:54.991
I didn't have to tell them.

00:27:55.071 --> 00:27:59.231
I'm not talking about Indians, I'm talking about others.

00:28:01.231 --> 00:28:03.431
And they have done, they have shown

00:28:03.511 --> 00:28:06.551
tremendous improvement, tremendous.

00:28:08.231 --> 00:28:10.911
We have been sending you Indian boys from there,

00:28:10.991 --> 00:28:12.711
Indian girls from there,

00:28:12.791 --> 00:28:15.431
just for you to know that

00:28:15.511 --> 00:28:19.671
they can also help you in Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:20.311 --> 00:28:22.471
Definitely can help you.

00:28:22.551 --> 00:28:25.351
You have to have a proper type of a person,

00:28:25.631 --> 00:28:29.471
and you'll be amazed at the way they are,

00:28:29.551 --> 00:28:32.671
that they can impart everything,

00:28:32.991 --> 00:28:37.591
and they are least bothered about their ego.

00:28:37.711 --> 00:28:39.551
There's no ego at all.

00:28:43.351 --> 00:28:47.711
So you are not achieving all this for your ego.

00:28:47.791 --> 00:28:50.591
You are achieving it because

00:28:52.311 --> 00:28:54.671
you are a seeker,

00:28:54.751 --> 00:28:57.391
and now you have become a Sahaja Yogi.

00:28:57.631 --> 00:29:00.191
So it is to be understood that it's not

00:29:00.271 --> 00:29:03.631
something like a advantage in money wise,

00:29:03.711 --> 00:29:05.711
or something that I have to have a power,

00:29:05.791 --> 00:29:06.831
this, that;

00:29:06.911 --> 00:29:08.911
because if you do not meditate,

00:29:08.991 --> 00:29:11.751
your attention will go to such things.

00:29:12.311 --> 00:29:14.191
Immediately you'll start thinking:

00:29:14.271 --> 00:29:16.591
Can I become the leader?

00:29:16.671 --> 00:29:20.831
All right, if not: "Should I debase the leader?

00:29:20.911 --> 00:29:22.831
How can I insult him?

00:29:22.911 --> 00:29:26.191
How can I fight for that? How can I do that?

00:29:26.271 --> 00:29:28.311
How can I work it out this way?"

00:29:28.391 --> 00:29:30.311
You try to insult also.

00:29:30.391 --> 00:29:34.191
If not possible, you might use violence sometimes,

00:29:34.271 --> 00:29:36.111
anger,

00:29:37.791 --> 00:29:40.551
because you are not yet, I should say,

00:29:40.631 --> 00:29:42.631
that much evolve, evolved,

00:29:42.711 --> 00:29:45.711
so much mature, so much wiser.

00:29:45.791 --> 00:29:47.991
So now, what you have to do

00:29:48.071 --> 00:29:50.991
is to... at the very

00:29:51.071 --> 00:29:53.711
first shot when you get up in the morning,

00:29:53.791 --> 00:29:55.831
you first say that: "Let me see,

00:29:55.911 --> 00:29:58.871
what is my responsibility as a Sahaja Yogi?"

00:30:01.791 --> 00:30:04.911
After some time you will start enjoying it,

00:30:04.991 --> 00:30:09.151
because it will give you such tremendous powers,

00:30:09.231 --> 00:30:12.471
such tremendous experience.

00:30:14.311 --> 00:30:19.511
Now then, you just sit down with very humble mind,

00:30:19.591 --> 00:30:22.831
and first of all say: "Mother, if I have any ego, please take away.

00:30:22.911 --> 00:30:24.711
Mother, if I have any conditioning,

00:30:24.791 --> 00:30:25.911
please take away; because

00:30:25.991 --> 00:30:27.471
I'm a seeker out and out,

00:30:27.551 --> 00:30:28.831
I don't want all these things."

00:30:28.911 --> 00:30:30.751
But if you do not meditate,

00:30:30.831 --> 00:30:34.751
then this Mr. Ego will secretly crawl upon you,

00:30:34.831 --> 00:30:36.911
and you may try to become the leader,

00:30:36.991 --> 00:30:39.551
or some sort of an assertion you'll do,

00:30:39.631 --> 00:30:45.191
some sort of a stupid ego actions,

00:30:45.271 --> 00:30:47.551
which we have many in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:47.631 --> 00:30:49.151
If you write them down,

00:30:49.231 --> 00:30:52.951
you will not know how to stop laughing.

00:30:55.431 --> 00:30:59.871
So to warn yourself, I would say that

00:30:59.951 --> 00:31:03.991
the only way to protect yourself is to do

00:31:04.071 --> 00:31:06.471
the meditation in the morning and evening,

00:31:06.551 --> 00:31:10.951
and also to keep yourself in complete bandhan.

00:31:16.551 --> 00:31:20.671
Yours is a very important role

00:31:20.751 --> 00:31:24.271
and a very important time,

00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:27.631
extremely important.

00:31:27.711 --> 00:31:29.951
You have no idea,

00:31:30.031 --> 00:31:33.951
that in the history of spirituality

00:31:34.031 --> 00:31:38.791
no one could do so much as you can do.

00:31:40.431 --> 00:31:44.471
So, if you really

00:31:46.391 --> 00:31:49.631
do the Antarmana,

00:31:49.711 --> 00:31:53.351
if you really see inside yourself,

00:31:53.431 --> 00:31:57.511
while meditating you see yourself, your chakras and all that,

00:31:57.591 --> 00:32:00.551
and then you find out this introspection:

00:32:00.631 --> 00:32:02.511
Why am I like this?

00:32:02.591 --> 00:32:04.871
Just separate from yourself, see for yourself:

00:32:04.991 --> 00:32:08.631
"Why am I like this? Why I did like this?

00:32:08.711 --> 00:32:12.791
Why do I think like this? Who am I?"

00:32:14.991 --> 00:32:17.751
These questions when answered,

00:32:17.831 --> 00:32:21.751
you will know all your worth, your value.

00:32:27.391 --> 00:32:31.071
I do not know how much I should stress,

00:32:31.151 --> 00:32:33.831
how much more is needed to stress

00:32:33.911 --> 00:32:38.031
the importance of meditation, every day.

00:32:39.351 --> 00:32:40.751
Like these advertisements you see,

00:32:40.791 --> 00:32:43.831
every day they just go on bombarding

00:32:43.911 --> 00:32:45.911
on your head, and:

00:32:45.991 --> 00:32:50.591
Buy this, buy that, buy, buy, buy, buy, buy.

00:32:50.831 --> 00:32:52.631
It acts.

00:32:53.911 --> 00:32:56.711
In the same way, you have to every day

00:32:56.791 --> 00:32:58.991
bombard yourself: "Now, meditation.

00:32:59.071 --> 00:33:01.711
Get to meditation. Get to meditation."

00:33:01.791 --> 00:33:04.671
Then you'll be surprised

00:33:04.791 --> 00:33:08.031
that when you'll go out, you'll see something beautiful;

00:33:08.111 --> 00:33:10.671
immediately you'll get into thoughtless awareness.

00:33:10.751 --> 00:33:12.911
Don't have to do.

00:33:13.471 --> 00:33:16.791
As soon as you'll meet a Sahaja Yogi, immediately into thoughtless;

00:33:16.871 --> 00:33:20.111
the other person, you both will go.

00:33:20.991 --> 00:33:24.991
Everything you start enjoying in a very different manner.

00:33:25.151 --> 00:33:27.911
And such beautiful feelings come in,

00:33:27.991 --> 00:33:32.311
such beautiful security is built up

00:33:34.671 --> 00:33:37.391
that you are surprised:

00:33:37.471 --> 00:33:39.751
"How I could be like that?

00:33:39.791 --> 00:33:44.191
How I could feel these securities just expressing

00:33:44.271 --> 00:33:47.791
themselves in such a beautiful manner?"

00:33:48.311 --> 00:33:54.151
Because if you are, say, washed and clean

00:33:54.231 --> 00:33:56.471
- simple thing, everyday life –

00:33:57.831 --> 00:34:00.751
then before touching any, everything you are careful

00:34:00.831 --> 00:34:03.631
that you don't again spoil them.

00:34:04.751 --> 00:34:09.311
If there's a sari, which is dirty, absolutely dirty,

00:34:09.391 --> 00:34:12.751
then if there are two spots or hundred spots,

00:34:12.831 --> 00:34:14.551
makes no difference.

00:34:15.071 --> 00:34:16.991
But when it is absolutely clean, then

00:34:17.071 --> 00:34:20.151
even the slightest spot you can get worried,

00:34:20.231 --> 00:34:22.591
because everybody will see that.

00:34:25.031 --> 00:34:26.791
In the same way,

00:34:26.871 --> 00:34:29.431
unless and until you cleanse yourself every day,

00:34:29.511 --> 00:34:32.471
you will not know what's wrong with you.

00:34:36.911 --> 00:34:41.671
I hope you'll pay full attention to what I've said here today,

00:34:41.751 --> 00:34:44.831
with full attention

00:34:46.351 --> 00:34:50.271
on your inner being

00:34:50.951 --> 00:34:53.391
projecting out,

00:34:55.111 --> 00:34:57.831
like a witness to yourself.

00:34:59.031 --> 00:35:01.831
Just see how you talk to others:

00:35:02.151 --> 00:35:04.231
"Why should I talk like that?

00:35:04.311 --> 00:35:06.831
What is the need to talk?"

00:35:07.311 --> 00:35:09.591
And then you'll start understanding

00:35:09.671 --> 00:35:11.511
that behind all this

00:35:11.591 --> 00:35:15.791
is some sort of a funny thing going on in my brain,

00:35:20.271 --> 00:35:23.351
and this brain has to be corrected

00:35:23.431 --> 00:35:25.231
- Very important.

00:35:25.471 --> 00:35:31.911
Now, at the end of the day we should find out:

00:35:31.991 --> 00:35:36.071
What good things I have done for Sahaja Yoga?

00:35:38.991 --> 00:35:43.871
Also, we can find out, "How I have been

00:35:43.951 --> 00:35:48.031
not up to the point in Sahaja Yoga?"

00:35:51.711 --> 00:35:54.391
If it could be done,

00:35:56.791 --> 00:36:00.551
you find out: "How far I have gone

00:36:01.991 --> 00:36:06.711
with these powers to spread Sahaja Yoga?

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:10.271
How far I can go?"

00:36:10.391 --> 00:36:13.071
It's really remarkable because,

00:36:13.151 --> 00:36:18.391
as I told you, in Austria we have some boys

00:36:18.711 --> 00:36:22.711
who are all the time researching about Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:23.911 --> 00:36:26.711
They have read the book of Adi Shankaracharya,

00:36:26.791 --> 00:36:29.591
which I have not yet read.

00:36:30.591 --> 00:36:32.511
They have read all kinds of things,

00:36:32.631 --> 00:36:35.591
just to find out how far they are,

00:36:35.671 --> 00:36:37.191
and as a result

00:36:37.271 --> 00:36:41.351
they themselves went on developing

00:36:41.471 --> 00:36:45.271
very, very deep into their beings;

00:36:45.431 --> 00:36:48.391
but the way, you see,

00:36:48.471 --> 00:36:52.991
you go on developing deep, deep, deep, deep, deep,

00:36:53.071 --> 00:36:56.631
and you'll be amazed the deeper you go,

00:36:56.711 --> 00:37:00.471
you won't show off, you won't show off.

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:02.711
You'll just emit.

00:37:02.791 --> 00:37:06.671
Like, one gentleman once came to My house

00:37:08.551 --> 00:37:12.911
and they said, "Mother, some cooler has come inside.

00:37:13.071 --> 00:37:16.671
It looks some cooler has come inside. Ya, ya, there's a cooler coming."

00:37:16.751 --> 00:37:20.391
He didn't say anything, didn't do anything.

00:37:21.071 --> 00:37:22.751
Just walking inside the house:

00:37:22.831 --> 00:37:25.751
Some cooler has come.

00:37:26.991 --> 00:37:28.831
You just felt, you know;

00:37:28.911 --> 00:37:31.551
like in the forest if you go,

00:37:31.631 --> 00:37:36.271
and you find complete silence, even the birds are not twittering,

00:37:36.351 --> 00:37:38.991
then know there's a tiger sitting there.

00:37:39.071 --> 00:37:43.511
Tiger doesn't do anything; it's just sleeping maybe, poor thing.

00:37:43.591 --> 00:37:47.231
But the whole place is awed by his presence, you see.

00:37:47.351 --> 00:37:51.151
In the same way, a Sahaja Yogi, anywhere, will stand out.

00:37:51.231 --> 00:37:52.911
Look at these saints, they didn't know

00:37:52.991 --> 00:37:54.911
how to raise even the Kundalini,

00:37:54.991 --> 00:37:57.871
but they were very pure people.

00:37:58.911 --> 00:38:00.751
They never raised anybody's Kundalini.

00:38:00.831 --> 00:38:02.711
They never gave Realization to anyone.

00:38:02.791 --> 00:38:04.711
They were extremely pure people.

00:38:04.791 --> 00:38:08.231
There was no impurity left in them.

00:38:08.311 --> 00:38:11.591
And so, how much they could produce:

00:38:11.671 --> 00:38:14.591
what poetry, what work,

00:38:14.671 --> 00:38:19.831
what spiritual, spiritual ideas,

00:38:19.911 --> 00:38:23.511
what sayings; I mean, tremendous –

00:38:23.591 --> 00:38:27.351
such depth in whatever they did,

00:38:27.631 --> 00:38:29.951
such effectiveness.

00:38:30.111 --> 00:38:32.911
Now, we are here to gain our spirituality,

00:38:32.991 --> 00:38:34.751
not to gain money,

00:38:34.791 --> 00:38:39.271
not to gain positions,

00:38:39.351 --> 00:38:43.431
powers - nothing. We are here to gain our spirituality,

00:38:43.511 --> 00:38:47.551
and in that spirituality, it's all there.

00:38:50.991 --> 00:38:53.551
All the satisfaction,

00:38:54.151 --> 00:38:55.791
everything is there.

00:38:55.911 --> 00:38:59.351
It will have an effect on the children.

00:39:01.751 --> 00:39:05.751
It will have an effect on the surroundings,

00:39:05.831 --> 00:39:10.071
in every way, and the personality.

00:39:12.991 --> 00:39:16.351
So it's not a question also individuals doing that,

00:39:16.431 --> 00:39:19.911
but collectively doing it.

00:39:21.951 --> 00:39:25.391
The collective should look a beautiful thing.

00:39:25.471 --> 00:39:29.391
So you should have, I would say, in an ashram,

00:39:29.511 --> 00:39:32.471
a collective meditation.

00:39:34.311 --> 00:39:36.911
In Austria they do it early in the morning,

00:39:36.991 --> 00:39:40.111
four o'clock, collectively.

00:39:40.471 --> 00:39:41.911
So they know how many are there,

00:39:41.991 --> 00:39:44.631
and how many are missing, this, that.

00:39:44.711 --> 00:39:47.711
But I said: "Don't point out. Let's see."

00:39:47.791 --> 00:39:50.191
When those who have been doing meditation like that

00:39:50.271 --> 00:39:53.711
rise so high, others start following them.

00:39:55.191 --> 00:39:58.231
So don't think about others: what time he got up.

00:39:58.311 --> 00:40:00.551
It's I; I have to look after myself.

00:40:00.631 --> 00:40:04.951
It's very selfish: Swarth.

00:40:05.031 --> 00:40:07.391
You have to know the meaning of Swa

00:40:07.471 --> 00:40:09.111
- that is selfishness –

00:40:09.191 --> 00:40:12.711
and when you know that meaning, then you are not bothered

00:40:12.791 --> 00:40:16.711
whatsoever anybody might say, whatsoever anyone may try to do.

00:40:16.791 --> 00:40:18.751
Supposing your husband is funny:

00:40:18.831 --> 00:40:21.351
Oh, doesn't matter. He'll come round.

00:40:21.431 --> 00:40:24.911
Supposing your wife is funny: Doesn't matter, she'll come round.

00:40:24.991 --> 00:40:28.831
Is nothing important. To you, this is the most important thing to do,

00:40:28.911 --> 00:40:30.911
and all those who have thought like this

00:40:30.991 --> 00:40:32.951
and have acted like this,

00:40:33.031 --> 00:40:35.871
were above everything.

00:40:35.991 --> 00:40:39.071
Nothing can put them down.

00:40:39.231 --> 00:40:42.231
So, today is the first day of Brisbane.

00:40:42.311 --> 00:40:45.991
I bless you all, that you should have

00:40:46.071 --> 00:40:49.311
this full idea about yourself,

00:40:49.431 --> 00:40:51.431
why you are on this earth,

00:40:51.511 --> 00:40:54.991
and what great work you are supposed to do.

00:40:55.071 --> 00:40:57.231
Each one of you is capable.

00:40:57.311 --> 00:40:59.231
Each one of you can do it,

00:40:59.311 --> 00:41:01.511
but you... I would request you

00:41:01.591 --> 00:41:05.631
that you imbibe these qualities within you,

00:41:05.711 --> 00:41:07.231
which are already there.

00:41:07.311 --> 00:41:10.231
I mean, I wouldn't say "imbibe", but you manifest them,

00:41:10.311 --> 00:41:12.391
and once you start manifesting,

00:41:12.471 --> 00:41:15.471
see your temperament how it is.

00:41:15.591 --> 00:41:18.391
We'll look after your children; don't worry.

00:41:18.471 --> 00:41:20.471
May God bless you.
