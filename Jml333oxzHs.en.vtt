WEBVTT

00:08.107 --> 00:14.169
It is good that all Sahaja Yogis have come together.

00:14.250 --> 00:22.053
When we meet like this, we can discuss many things of mutual interest

00:22.199 --> 00:27.922
and tell even small details about them to each other

00:28.002 --> 00:31.927
how to clean yourself as your Mother’s name itself is Nirmala

00:32.007 --> 00:36.952
and it contains many powers.

00:37.791 --> 00:41.151
The first word is NIH which means not.

00:41.232 --> 00:47.291
Something that actually does not exist but appears to exist,

00:47.397 --> 00:52.850
is called Mahamaya (illusion).

00:53.109 --> 00:57.984
In fact it is not there but we feel it exists

00:58.584 --> 01:04.200
and this is called Mahamaya and the whole world is like that.

01:04.281 --> 01:07.981
It is seen but it is not true:

01:08.101 --> 01:16.133
if we are trapped into it we feel that it is the only thing we have to live for.

01:16.213 --> 01:21.454
Then we feel that economic conditions are unsatisfactory,

01:21.534 --> 01:27.100
social and domestic (family) conditions are bad,

01:27.181 --> 01:33.127
everything around us is bad and we cannot see anything good.

01:33.208 --> 01:38.849
Water on the sea surface is very dirty and turbid.

01:39.015 --> 01:42.711
Many objects are seen floating on it.

01:42.791 --> 01:49.285
But if we go deep into the sea there is so much beauty, wealth and power

01:49.365 --> 01:54.330
that we forget that on the surface the water is so bad.

01:54.411 --> 02:00.235
The point is that everything that you see around is illusion.

02:00.322 --> 02:03.832
You must remember first of all it is all nothing.

02:03.917 --> 02:10.534
If you have to establish ‘NIH’ you have to tell yourself,

02:10.640 --> 02:15.740
whenever a thought comes, say “not this

02:15.820 --> 02:19.678
(ya neti neti vachane nigamor avochus)

02:19.810 --> 02:24.455
another thought comes, say it is not there.

02:24.536 --> 02:28.902
You have to say this again and again.

02:28.982 --> 02:35.678
Then you will understand the meaning of word ‘NIH’.

02:38.345 --> 02:43.940
The illusion that you see is not just the illusion,

02:45.436 --> 02:49.921
but there is something beyond that.

02:50.127 --> 02:56.270
However, we have wasted so many years of lives in these illusions

02:56.351 --> 03:02.650
that we give importance to all that actually does not exist

03:02.743 --> 03:07.436
and in doing that we have made heaps of sins.

03:07.517 --> 03:13.047
We have tried to derive the pleasure from many things.

03:13.128 --> 03:21.752
We have received nothing from whatever we have tried to enjoy.

03:22.965 --> 03:28.195
Essentially, it is all nothing – tasteless.

03:28.275 --> 03:37.029
So, the outlook should be, it is all that nothing, it is all false.

03:39.177 --> 03:43.770
Only Brahma is real the rest all is false.

03:43.851 --> 03:46.815
You have to adopt this view point everywhere in life.

03:46.896 --> 03:50.037
Then you will understand the true meaning of Sahaja Yoga.

03:50.117 --> 03:53.935
What happens with most of the Sahaja Yogis after realisation, is that they think,

03:54.016 --> 03:57.796
“now that we are realised we have Mataji’s blessings.

03:58.836 --> 04:01.922
Then why are we not prosperous?”.

04:02.348 --> 04:08.508
That means they think God is in the prosperity.

04:08.914 --> 04:14.961
Inspite of having our realization why our family conditions do not improve?

04:15.041 --> 04:20.526
Instead, you should think that, inspite of the realization

04:20.654 --> 04:24.900
why my temperament (swabhav) has not changed.

04:24.981 --> 04:32.247
Then you’ll realise that my swabhav has not changed.

04:32.328 --> 04:36.801
See, how beautiful is this word ‘Swabhav’

04:36.882 --> 04:41.230
– ‘Swa’ is Atman i.e. the spirit and bhav is the nature.

04:41.311 --> 04:44.142
Have you become the nature of your Self ?

04:44.223 --> 04:47.797
If you become your self there is so much beauty within,

04:47.878 --> 04:53.120
that all that goes on outside would appear like drama.

04:53.201 --> 04:58.197
So long as this witness state is not fully awakened within you,

04:58.277 --> 05:01.924
you have not followed the word ‘NIH’ and also you have not practised it.

05:02.005 --> 05:07.395
Suppose you are aware that you have not established ‘NIH’ within you

05:07.476 --> 05:11.145
and even now you become s emotional or egoistical,

05:11.225 --> 05:14.608
coercive or submissive and feel sad about it,

05:14.689 --> 05:18.247
then the state of being on ‘NIH’ is at the centre of these extremes.

05:18.934 --> 05:21.740
You are neither in this state nor in that.

05:21.820 --> 05:26.186
This state has to be established and it can be best achieved in meditation.

05:26.267 --> 05:30.986
Just by following the idea of ‘NIH’ in your life you will become (Nirvichar) thoughtless.

05:31.067 --> 05:34.240
First of all, you should become thoughtless.

05:34.320 --> 05:37.757
Once you start jumping on a thought however good or bad it may be,

05:37.837 --> 05:39.874
you go into some sort of inertia

05:39.954 --> 05:42.715
and in that state you jump from one thought to another.

05:42.795 --> 05:49.511
So some people have said that a bad thought should be opposed by a good thought.

05:49.591 --> 05:55.381
In other words if a vehicle or train coming from one direction,

05:55.461 --> 06:00.963
is pushed back by another one, both will stop somewhere at the centre.

06:01.043 --> 06:04.831
It is good but occasionally it can become harmful.

06:04.911 --> 06:08.958
A bad thought when put down by a good thought remains suppressed

06:09.038 --> 06:14.011
but it can suddenly come up and it happens with many people.

06:14.092 --> 06:19.345
They press down their normal thoughts and always tell themselves

06:19.426 --> 06:24.030
that they must be good to others and must be well behaved etc.

06:24.110 --> 06:29.451
These people can sometimes be in trouble.

06:29.532 --> 06:36.470
Suddenly they get exasperated and others cannot understand,

06:36.551 --> 06:43.361
why these well behaved people are annoyed.

06:43.826 --> 06:50.132
Also they lose their inner peace.

06:50.358 --> 07:00.987
All the beauty within them is destroyed. So we should be always thoughtless.

07:01.068 --> 07:07.105
Ban all thoughts from your mind

07:07.581 --> 07:14.664
and then you would automatically remain at the centre in the Vilamba.

07:16.043 --> 07:20.476
You must make all efforts. Now you would ask

07:20.562 --> 07:25.079
“Mother how can we do anything without thinking?”

07:26.631 --> 07:31.173
But what are thoughts? They are hollow.

07:31.293 --> 07:35.881
In thoughtless state you are one with the God’s power

07:35.980 --> 07:41.688
that is, the drop, which is you, comes in the ocean which is God.

07:41.768 --> 07:45.423
Hence His power also comes to you.

07:45.503 --> 07:50.026
Does this finger think? Is it not still moving?

07:50.107 --> 07:55.011
Give your thoughts to God and ask Him to think about you.

07:55.110 --> 08:01.327
But it is rather difficult, because you are not thoughtless.

08:01.408 --> 08:06.032
Many people say “we have surrendered everything”,

08:06.113 --> 08:11.488
but it does not happen because they do it only in talking.

08:11.568 --> 08:14.707
Surrendering is not just talking.

08:14.788 --> 08:20.410
When you attain thoughtlessness then surrendering is automatic .

08:20.491 --> 08:23.237
That is you have stopped thinking.

08:23.318 --> 08:26.738
When you stop thinking you come to the centre.

08:26.819 --> 08:32.628
When at the centre, immediately you go into thoughtless awareness, i.e. become one with God’s power

08:32.709 --> 08:36.695
and when you are one with the God’s power, He looks after you.

08:36.776 --> 08:40.673
He takes care of your small things also. You will be amazed.

08:40.754 --> 08:44.609
Sometimes try doing things on your own.

08:44.690 --> 08:51.861
Then you’ll experience “Sankalpa vikalpa karoti” (Man proposes and God disposes).

08:51.942 --> 08:57.499
If you want to go through a particular way, try doing it.

08:57.580 --> 09:01.722
All the countries have tried it and failed.

09:01.803 --> 09:06.511
It is worth trying and after that you will realise

09:06.591 --> 09:10.851
that what you were doing earlier was wrong.

09:10.931 --> 09:19.477
So once you are in thoughtlessness you will get all inspirations,

09:19.558 --> 09:24.269
all powers and everything.

09:29.554 --> 09:35.370
The idea that you get in thoughtlessness is an inspiration.

09:35.451 --> 09:38.537
You will be surprised.

09:39.011 --> 09:42.962
Everything will come to you as if on a plate.

09:43.149 --> 09:46.286
You are standing to give a speech.

09:46.366 --> 09:48.402
Just be thoughtless and start.

09:48.489 --> 09:56.016
Although you have never given a speech earlier or do not even know how to do it

09:56.097 --> 10:02.464
or have no special knowledge of any subject, you will speak so well

10:02.545 --> 10:08.348
that others will be astonished how you know so much.

10:08.429 --> 10:12.909
But once you are deep in the thoughtless state,

10:12.990 --> 10:18.205
all comes from there and not from your brain.

10:18.505 --> 10:21.460
I tell you about Me. You pray:

10:21.541 --> 10:26.828
‘Mother kindly see that such and such happens to me’

10:26.909 --> 10:31.126
and I do not think about that.

10:31.206 --> 10:36.331
It is amazing. I put all that in the thoughtlessness.

10:36.412 --> 10:39.674
All machinery is working there. J

10:39.755 --> 10:44.755
ust put it to that machinery and it is all ready.

10:44.836 --> 10:49.164
Allow that machinery, you can call it silent machinery, to work.

10:49.245 --> 10:52.648
You should put all your problems to it.

10:52.729 --> 10:56.616
But it is very difficult for intellectuals

10:56.697 --> 11:01.408
because their habit is to go on thinking about everything.

11:01.489 --> 11:05.915
You should be able to go into thoughtlessness

11:08.268 --> 11:12.363
while trying to understand a subject.

11:12.443 --> 11:15.127
All becomes clear automatically.

11:15.208 --> 11:20.711
Research that you are doing should also be in thoughtless state.

11:20.792 --> 11:25.183
Let your hands work while you are thoughtless.

11:25.264 --> 11:29.477
You can do your research extremely well in this way. I tell you many things.

11:29.665 --> 11:33.407
I have never read science in my life and know nothing about it.

11:33.487 --> 11:38.164
Still I tell you all that. Where does all the knowledge come from?

11:38.245 --> 11:42.667
From the thoughtlessness; I only speak and see all that is going on.

11:42.748 --> 11:45.854
It was all kept ready in that computer which is speaking.

11:45.934 --> 11:48.067
If you are not in the thoughtless state

11:48.147 --> 11:52.861
you do not use your computer and put your brain on top of it.

11:52.948 --> 11:58.510
It is such on old computer and lot of accurate work has been done on it.

11:58.590 --> 12:03.048
You are bound to make mistakes if you use your own brain

12:03.128 --> 12:07.554
and do not consult the computer. It has no meaning.

12:07.747 --> 12:11.296
Thus the solution for all this is the prefix “PRA”.

12:11.376 --> 12:17.924
We say PRASHIKSHAN (Enlightened Education) in which we use the suffix PRA.

12:18.005 --> 12:23.352
[Ndlr – Whenever prefix “PRA” is used (in Sanskrit, Hindi or Marathi) it means enlightened].

12:23.433 --> 12:28.871
All that happens in the thoughtless state is enlightened and thus is PRA.

12:28.951 --> 12:33.262
It is so PRACHANDA (Enormous) – here again it is PRA.

12:33.342 --> 12:37.614
Some other words are PRAKASHIT (brought to light),

12:37.695 --> 12:43.047
PRADNYA (wise), where we use the prefix PRA meaning enlightened.

12:43.128 --> 12:47.650
Light never talks. If you switch on the light in the room,

12:47.730 --> 12:51.267
the light won’t speak or give you any ideas.

12:51.347 --> 12:54.552
It would just make everything visible.

12:54.632 --> 13:00.131
Same is about the light of thoughtlessness.

13:00.211 --> 13:06.138
That ‘NIH’ is common in all such words like ‘Nirvichar’ (thoughtless),

13:06.218 --> 13:15.836
Nirvajya (Selfless), Nirahankar (egoless), Nirakar (formless).

13:15.917 --> 13:20.074
Thus lots of words come from the prefix NIH.

13:20.154 --> 13:27.335
You establish it and then you come into Nirvikalpa (doubtless state).

13:27.415 --> 13:33.452
First become thoughtless and then doubtless (Nirvikalpa).

13:33.532 --> 13:39.113
Then all your doubts go and you know that there is some power that works.

13:39.193 --> 13:44.484
It works very fast and is all subtle. You will be amazed how it happens.

13:44.564 --> 13:48.647
This is also about time. I never see watch.

13:48.727 --> 13:54.582
Sometimes it stops and shows, when the time is 3.00 o’clock.

13:54.662 --> 13:57.930
Just to show others I wind my watch.

13:58.010 --> 14:04.284
But my real watch is in the thoughtlessness. It is permanently stopped.

14:04.364 --> 14:10.200
If anything is to be done, it takes place at the right time.

14:10.280 --> 14:15.301
Then there are no regrets whether it is late or not.

14:15.382 --> 14:18.094
Whatever it may be I am where I am.

14:18.175 --> 14:24.720
Yesterday, my car failed but I was relaxing because I wanted to see the stars.

14:24.801 --> 14:29.733
That beauty is not visible in London and I wanted to see it.

14:29.813 --> 14:32.786
Thus I was enjoying the starlit night.

14:32.867 --> 14:37.206
Others were worried and they started giving vibrations (bandhans).

14:37.286 --> 14:40.652
I told them, why are you wasting your vibrations?

14:40.732 --> 14:44.964
See the stars which you do not watch often. I had to see the beauty in the sky.

14:45.045 --> 14:47.531
Its splendour was spread all over the sky.

14:47.612 --> 14:50.438
The sky thought Mataji should see it also

14:50.519 --> 14:53.602
because (it thinks) She always Her attention only on Sahaja yogis.

14:53.683 --> 14:56.049
I wanted to get down and watch it but I was worried

14:56.130 --> 14:59.247
that the Sahaja yogis might think that I am in trouble.

14:59.328 --> 15:02.448
So I was just watching the sky from where I was and enjoying it.

15:02.529 --> 15:05.426
In short, you should not be a slave of anything.

15:05.507 --> 15:12.391
If you are thoughtless God takes you everywhere as if on his hands.

15:12.618 --> 15:14.685
He makes all arrangements.

15:14.852 --> 15:19.484
He knows everything and there is no need to tell him about anything.

15:19.565 --> 15:23.910
But you must see whether you are in the PRAVAHA (main stream) or not.

15:23.990 --> 15:26.720
You should see if you are in God’s Pravaha.

15:26.800 --> 15:31.651
If you are not in it then you are stuck up somewhere on the bank;

15:31.744 --> 15:35.845
then current comes and takes you in, twice or thrice

15:35.925 --> 15:37.849
but again you are on the bank.

15:37.929 --> 15:42.661
Then you say ‘Mataji, nothing goes smoothly for me’. It won’t.

15:47.428 --> 15:49.619
Because you are entangled.

15:49.699 --> 15:55.097
Shri Ganesha’s praise that you sing is excellent. It says,

15:55.424 --> 15:58.388
PADTA PRAVAHI “flowing in the main stream (Pravaha)”

15:58.468 --> 16:01.678
which means enlightened main stream.

16:01.758 --> 16:04.797
We should swim in the pravaha.

16:04.877 --> 16:08.631
You should not bring your own separate, current in it.

16:08.711 --> 16:11.350
Pravaha also means enlightened vehicle.

16:11.430 --> 16:19.841
The Arti of Shri Ganesha also says ‘Nirvani Rakshave’, i.e. protect me when I am dying. Y

16:19.921 --> 16:24.058
ou also pray ‘Raksha Raksha Parameshwara’

16:24.138 --> 16:26.935
O God protect me, but you want to protect yourself.

16:27.015 --> 16:33.111
Why should, then, God protect you? He says, “let him protect himself.”

16:33.217 --> 16:39.978
Then you have all the sufferings of the world upon you like big mountains.

16:40.575 --> 16:46.324
I feel like laughing. These are all like balloons. They have no meaning.

16:48.291 --> 16:54.607
What I want to emphasise is that you must learn to go deep within yourself

16:54.688 --> 16:59.837
and realise all this in the thoughtlessness then you can become Nirvikalpa (doubtless).

16:59.918 --> 17:03.246
You should attain Nirasaktata – Asaktata means attachments.

17:03.327 --> 17:05.602
You must have no attachment (Nirasakta).

17:05.683 --> 17:07.902
We have here, (India) ‘my son, my daughter’.

17:07.983 --> 17:09.803
In England, it is just the opposite.

17:09.903 --> 17:14.328
There, they are not attached to son or daughter.

17:14.408 --> 17:17.358
They are worried only about themselves.

17:17.438 --> 17:21.075
Son is left to the dogs. They even kill their children.

17:21.155 --> 17:24.408
Some might not believe it but they kill.

17:24.661 --> 17:28.411
Each week a mother kills two children. They are so cruel.

17:28.731 --> 17:36.676
Here you have this attachment; my son, my daughter, my husband, my house etc.,

17:36.757 --> 17:43.061
everything is mine and at the end your “self” is left out!

17:43.361 --> 17:49.401
You should say “Nothing is mine and everything is yours.”

17:50.205 --> 17:56.524
Kabir says “so long as a goat is alive it is bleating ‘main, main’ (I, I)

17:56.605 --> 18:01.639
but when it is slaughtered there is no life left,

18:01.720 --> 18:05.795
she realizes that I spent my whole life in saying “main, main”.

18:05.876 --> 18:09.601
Those whom I called mine have turned out to be useless

18:13.614 --> 18:19.785
– everybody in the family, in the house –

18:19.955 --> 18:27.230
all those whom I considered to be mine have turned out to be useless.

18:27.357 --> 18:34.439
They themselves killed me and ate. Then it realizes it’s mistake.

18:34.520 --> 18:40.486
Then someone creates taut strings of its guts

18:40.597 --> 18:44.076
and fixes them on an musical instrument.

18:44.157 --> 18:48.096
When these strings are pulled they make a sound “Toohie, Toohie”

18:48.176 --> 18:54.972
(you alone are.) You must become like that.

18:55.299 --> 19:00.530
Once you are established in the idea I am nought, I have no existence,

19:00.611 --> 19:05.489
then only you will understand the word ‘NIH’.
