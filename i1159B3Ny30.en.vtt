00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.560
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:18.530
as a very great personality.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.740
And you know why He came on this earth --

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:34.620
to establish this is the new form of, not Virat, not Virata,

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:46.510
but a form by which this country became so prosperous.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:59.530
And by His advent only He created a beautiful mentality

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:08.700
among the people how to develop this country with Dharma.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.640
And you had very great leaders

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.590
who followed Him

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.510
and who worshipped Him in a way,

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.540
and created a new world of this America.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.670
But unfortunately as the time passed on,

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:46.720
His form vanished from the minds of the people.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.630
The reason was, Krishna was represented here

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:58.510
by very, very wrong type of people who had no idea

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.600
about Shri Krishna:

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:12.640
that He was a great master of wealth,

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:20.540
that He knew how to use the wealth and how to create

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.670
the wealth with dharma, not with adharma.

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.680
They all forgot about it completely

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.570
and gradually started using maneuvering powers,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:45.600
all kinds of, all kinds of adharmic things -- cheating, grabbing

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:54.500
money, spending their money in absolutely useless things.

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.620
He is Kubera. He doesn't need any money, of course,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.710
He achieves money;

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.510
and not only that,

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.520
He is living, He lived in money.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:21.660
They said that He created a golden house for Him,

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:27.580
absolutely made with gold in Dwarika,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:30.620
but it submerged in the water,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:37.600
in the sea, and nobody believed that it is true.

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:42.600
But now they have found out His house under the water,

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:44.530
very deep waters,

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:52.530
so all their conjecture about Him was wrong, all false;

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:56.700
that He was definitely a man who made lots of money

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:58.700
by dharma.

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:04.550
Also He was a son of a king, and He built this Dwarika

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.540
out of gold.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.630
It is still there and people have found it,

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:15.660
but under the sea.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.500
Thousands of years have passed, but still existed.

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.700
Only because perhaps we belong to Shri Krishna,

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:28.570
it is still existing.

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.590
That's what it is, because He was the one

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:37.600
who was for satya first -- truth.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:44.650
He was for truth, and He worked out everything

00:06:45.540 --> 00:06:48.710
on the principle of truth.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:53.540
Whatever was not truth, He tried to finish it off.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:07:00.580
Whatever was destructive, He tried to remove that;

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:07.700
and He established Himself through truth only, truth only.

00:07:08.620 --> 00:07:12.690
He's the one who represent the truth, absolute truth,

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:18.530
and how the truth can prevail in everything.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:25.500
I'm just the opposite of Him because I don't understand

00:07:25.630 --> 00:07:27.570
money at all,

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:32.500
but He's looking after that part in My life.

00:07:32.700 --> 00:07:35.660
I'm so hopelessly bad --

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.740
I don't understand banking, I don't understand money,

00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:46.570
I can't even count money. Now what can you say to that?

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:49.740
But He's there to look after,

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:54.730
and I've never a dearth of money, never a dearth of any

00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.520
wealth, it's all full of it.

00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.590
Also it comes through your sense of satisfaction.

00:08:07.630 --> 00:08:10.680
If you have that sense of satisfaction,

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:15.730
you don't look for money.

00:08:16.620 --> 00:08:20.660
What happened in your country that some people got money.

00:08:21.530 --> 00:08:25.530
If you got little money, then you get the taste of money.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.540
They're not satisfied people.

00:08:28.670 --> 00:08:33.700
So like mad they went on spending on nonsensical things.

00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:38.680
It is something very much human.

00:08:39.590 --> 00:08:42.730
After your human evolution,

00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:47.560
after you have reached a certain state of enlightenment,

00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:54.740
then all these demeaning things like greed

00:08:56.580 --> 00:08:59.590
all disappear from your character.

00:08:59.590 --> 00:09:03.680
You don't have that greed in you anymore

00:09:04.580 --> 00:09:09.510
and you become extremely a satisfied person.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.730
To you money is there, all right, but it's not so important.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:23.630
It is just that you think don't need it, and you'll get it --

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:27.740
all done by Shri Krishna all over, can you imagine?

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.620
He's doing all this, looking after you

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.740
and helping you with money.

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.710
We started Sahaja Yoga without a single pai.

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.600
I don't, never had any problem.

00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:51.590
So one thing, as Kubera He's the supplier of wealth.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:55.520
He looks after people who don't have money.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:59.560
He gives money to people who stand by truth,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:04.650
who enjoy the life of truth.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:19.680
It is His work that people enjoy wealth, otherwise they don't.

00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.640
They have this much, they want to have more;

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:25.650
that means they don't enjoy the wealth.

00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.540
They have a little, they want to get much more. Why?

00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:34.590
Because they are not enjoying whatever they have.

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:38.650
But after Self-realization you will see that you enjoy

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:41.650
whatever you have.

00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:45.600
You enjoy it fully, absolutely,

00:10:45.710 --> 00:10:49.610
and you don't hanker after something that is not there.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:52.520
Doesn't matter if you don't have.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.510
Many a times people have asked Me,

00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.650
"Mother, why not we have the puja of Krishna as Kubera?"

00:11:00.730 --> 00:11:02.620
I said, "All right.

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:05.570
Just now everybody's trying to become Kuber.

00:11:05.700 --> 00:11:07.660
Let them learn a lesson,

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:11.670
and then we will have the puja of Kubera."

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:17.560
And that's why today I've agreed to have this puja.

00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.620
Because now you have seen what happens if you have greed.

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:28.650
You go on committing all kinds of sins,

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:34.510
all kinds of wrong things which can destroy your country.

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:37.740
Such a rich country has now become a poor country.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:40.660
Where is that money gone?

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.550
They're very clever.

00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.740
Somebody told Me today that this money with the insurance.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:48.620
"My God," I said, "the law is such that

00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:50.730
you can't get out that money."

00:11:51.590 --> 00:11:55.580
Secondly they said that it is in offshore and all that.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:12:01.560
I said, "But see now, they were never afraid

00:12:02.690 --> 00:12:05.730
that they'll be caught up,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:10.540
and they continued for so many years.

00:12:11.640 --> 00:12:14.580
But I'm sure one day

00:12:14.650 --> 00:12:18.670
they'll all be exposed by Kubera Himself."

00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:24.590
So today by worshipping Kubera what we are doing,

00:12:24.690 --> 00:12:30.580
we are going to establish, establish the truth of money,

00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:35.510
what lies behind the money,

00:12:39.660 --> 00:12:45.500
what is the point of having money.

00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:47.540
This country had money.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:52.660
As a result so many good people came here to work,

00:12:53.510 --> 00:12:56.570
and you had so many complementary things.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.680
You had lots of people who have complemented,

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:05.500
because I think in certain things Americans were little less;

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.580
not in intelligence, but in brilliance I think

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.720
they were little bit lacking.

00:13:12.570 --> 00:13:15.550
So they got very brilliant people from abroad,

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.680
and also they were very focused people,

00:13:21.510 --> 00:13:23.610
so they worked it out very well.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:28.540
Also they respected people who came with brains.

00:13:28.660 --> 00:13:31.720
So this is what happens when you forget

00:13:32.610 --> 00:13:36.510
that truth is the main point.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:41.520
If you don't have the truth, no use having money.

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:46.500
Because what you did was to go around with this thing,

00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:52.650
that thing, I mean all kinds of things, to just get money.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:57.670
The other day I was traveling through Las Vegas -- last year.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:01.620
And when we stopped at that airport

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:05.540
so many people walked into the aeroplane,

00:14:05.700 --> 00:14:07.690
and they all were looking as if somebody's dead

00:14:08.570 --> 00:14:09.680
in their family or what has happened.

00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:12.560
First I couldn't understand.

00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:16.620
Then said, "Mother, they have lost all their money."

00:14:20.710 --> 00:14:24.610
So when they have money, they are jumping, next moment

00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.740
they are crying because they have lost the money.

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:29.620
What's the use of such a money

00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:34.510
which is so temporary, which is so useless?

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:39.740
But that is human nature, to run after maya.

00:14:40.650 --> 00:14:47.510
And this is the quality of money, that it gives you maya.

00:14:47.700 --> 00:14:52.590
Maya like this, that they get a little money somehow;

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:56.710
with that little money, they buy something.

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.560
Then they think money is very important.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.600
You see, you can buy lots of things,

00:15:03.700 --> 00:15:06.610
you can buy cars, you can buy airplanes, this, that.

00:15:07.590 --> 00:15:12.620
So there is where maya plays on you, and you start running

00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.510
after that mad money which makes you mad.

00:15:17.620 --> 00:15:21.720
It's nice that at this juncture they have discovered

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:25.700
the falsehood of this maya money.

00:15:26.590 --> 00:15:30.520
And I am so happy that they were all handcuffed,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:36.510
and all their power of money was finished.

00:15:36.670 --> 00:15:41.620
So, this Kubera is working out all these tricks.

00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:48.580
Krishna is a very tricky, extremely tricky personality.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:54.740
He puts the tricks, every action after every action.

00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.580
Now money matters:

00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.510
He first befools you that you run after it,

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:09.680
and then you just discover that it was stupidity.

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.500
We have a story in our land, country, called "Sheikh Chili."

00:16:15.610 --> 00:16:17.580
He got little money,

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:23.560
and he got into the grab of this maya.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.720
So he thought, "I can do very well."

00:16:27.570 --> 00:16:30.520
So he started dreaming as to what he should do.

00:16:30.670 --> 00:16:34.540
So he went and bought lots of eggs and he said,

00:16:34.630 --> 00:16:39.540
"Now these eggs will have little, little chicks which will grow,

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:42.590
which will I'll sell and I'll so much money,"

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:44.600
and it was like that he was talking.

00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:50.730
And while thinking about it in his mind went off to sleep,

00:16:51.590 --> 00:16:54.690
and then in his sleep he fell on the eggs

00:16:55.530 --> 00:16:58.580
and all the eggs broke.

00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:01.630
So the maya was over.

00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:05.600
This should happen early, but if it doesn't happen

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:10.600
then you end up in the jail or something like that.

00:17:10.740 --> 00:17:17.520
Sahaja Yoga is one thing which gives you a complete vision,

00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.570
complete vision of the destruction

00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.510
that can follow this maya business.

00:17:25.730 --> 00:17:30.570
It is something, such a insight

00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:33.600
that you don't have to do anything with it.

00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:38.510
I'm different, I told you I don't understand it at all.

00:17:38.620 --> 00:17:42.510
But even if you understand the value of money,

00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.520
even if you understand that money can bring

00:17:46.630 --> 00:17:51.590
lots of things to you, despite that you don't look at it,

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:57.660
just turn your face -- that is the sign of a real Sahaja yogi.

00:17:57.730 --> 00:18:01.580
To him it doesn't matter, temperamentally.

00:18:01.660 --> 00:18:06.520
It's not that he does something for that or tells his mind, nothing;

00:18:06.630 --> 00:18:11.560
temperamentally he doesn't care for money,

00:18:11.650 --> 00:18:15.640
just because he's above it.

00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:19.670
The one who is above money is a real Sahaja yogi.

00:18:20.510 --> 00:18:23.700
The one who is engulfed in the nonsense

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:28.520
and the maya of money is not a Sahaja yogi.

00:18:28.630 --> 00:18:30.630
Of course I have seen most of the Sahaja yogis

00:18:30.710 --> 00:18:33.500
are extremely honest, specially in the West.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.620
But in India there's a disease: as you have some here viruses,

00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.600
we have certain viruses in India also.

00:18:41.740 --> 00:18:44.510
So they still go on running after money,

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:46.630
to them money is important.

00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:50.720
But in the evolutionary process if you reach a certain state

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.640
where you rise above your Nabhi Chakra,

00:18:55.520 --> 00:19:00.500
rise your Nabhi Chakra, then money's not so important.

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:02.670
It's not so important.

00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:16.530
To Me, I find I cannot buy things unnecessarily.

00:19:17.690 --> 00:19:19.730
Of course I mean there are so many unnecessary things

00:19:20.630 --> 00:19:24.640
gathered, because you people give Me here presents, this that.

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:30.500
But Myself, you'll be amazed, I'm so nervous or I should say

00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:36.620
hesitant, or you may call it absolutely absent from the spot

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:41.600
where they are doing any business, any purchasing.

00:19:43.530 --> 00:19:45.740
Come here and fix it please.

00:19:51.530 --> 00:19:54.670
It falls down, so I'm holding on!

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:03.590
Correct, now all right.

00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:13.690
In the same way, Sahaja yogis have to fix their mind

00:20:21.590 --> 00:20:23.710
to their spirit,

00:20:24.610 --> 00:20:30.590
and enjoy the powers of your spirit, your own.

00:20:30.730 --> 00:20:37.560
That enjoyment once you get it, you don't fall to your greed.

00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.530
This is something

00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:45.500
very, very simple,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.580
but sometimes you don't do it.

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:54.510
You get enamored by something, maybe a car,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:57.620
maybe aeroplane, I don't know what -- whatever it is.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:02.520
It's a headache to have too many cars, isn't it?

00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:05.640
But people have;

00:21:06.530 --> 00:21:08.560
they think by that people are impressed,

00:21:08.680 --> 00:21:11.650
and they think no end of themselves or not -- nothing.

00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:15.720
If they are impressed, what is the use to us?

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.700
What do you get out of it?

00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:24.620
Sahaja yogi has his own spirit to enjoy,

00:21:24.730 --> 00:21:26.600
more than anything else.

00:21:27.510 --> 00:21:28.720
He doesn't want to possess anything.

00:21:29.590 --> 00:21:32.520
It's a headache to possess things also.

00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:36.610
The other side of it is a Mahalakshmi.

00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:40.680
If that principle is within you, Mahalakshmi Principle,

00:21:41.570 --> 00:21:43.700
you'll have never a problem of money.

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:47.580
On the contrary, you'll know how to stop it.

00:21:47.710 --> 00:21:51.720
So far as I am concerned,

00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:56.640
I get fed up of My Mahalakshmi Principle

00:21:57.520 --> 00:21:59.610
because I don't know from where it works out,

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:05.640
how it works out, without any effort.

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:12.740
But the temperamentally, I have no interest at all,

00:22:13.620 --> 00:22:15.700
temperamentally.

00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:23.620
But it is the, I don't know what is the cause of this effect.

00:22:25.550 --> 00:22:29.510
Now supposing I buy some small thing, just like that,

00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:33.720
it will sell at least ten times more.

00:22:34.610 --> 00:22:38.660
It will be of value at least ten times more, I don't know how.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:45.630
It's very surprising -- automatically.

00:22:46.630 --> 00:22:53.500
I'll buy something very small, then I find it's very expensive.

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:58.720
How it works, just must be miracles of Mahalakshmi, I think.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:23:03.660
So what I have to tell you is this,

00:23:04.570 --> 00:23:09.690
that you should not worry about your financial situations

00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:12.530
at all.

00:23:12.650 --> 00:23:14.590
Do not go on calculating,

00:23:14.710 --> 00:23:19.500
do not see how much money you have in the bank,

00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.500
what you have to do with your money,

00:23:21.610 --> 00:23:22.640
where you should invest.

00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:27.500
I have seen people going mad planning the whole thing.

00:23:27.670 --> 00:23:31.590
There's no need to do that once you are a Sahaja yogi.

00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:35.500
It all works automatically.

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:39.590
The greed is within you, just like any other disease.

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.550
As you have diseases, greed is also there.

00:23:43.710 --> 00:23:47.640
As your diseases can get cured with Sahaja Yoga,

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:56.730
your diseases, as much as your greed is, it vanishes.

00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:01.650
You don't know what is greed is.

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:07.620
The only way to counter-balance is to become extremely

00:24:07.730 --> 00:24:10.590
generous.

00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.520
If you are extremely generous, greed will run away.

00:24:15.650 --> 00:24:18.620
That may be another way of doing it.

00:24:19.610 --> 00:24:25.550
Supposing you get something in your house

00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:29.570
and you think it is too much.

00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:33.530
Not to get rid of it but just to think it's too much,

00:24:33.530 --> 00:24:35.550
you should give it to someone; you just start thinking,

00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:37.550
whom can you give?

00:24:37.730 --> 00:24:39.740
And immediately you'll remember,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:44.600
"Oh, that person doesn't have this. Let me give him this."

00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:48.660
And if you give him he'll be so thankful, so thankful,

00:24:49.540 --> 00:24:52.610
and he'll say all kinds of nice things to you

00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:57.500
which normally nobody would say to you, nobody.

00:25:00.730 --> 00:25:06.590
And it's surprising how joy-giving it is,

00:25:06.710 --> 00:25:11.540
how people like your generosity.

00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.660
So you have to be generous, just generous;

00:25:15.530 --> 00:25:17.630
not with yourself, but with others.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:23.550
As much as possible, be generous.

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:32.590
Generosity is very love-giving, one of the expressions

00:25:32.710 --> 00:25:35.590
of your love.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:39.690
Many a times it has happened with Me

00:25:40.570 --> 00:25:44.690
that I saw somebody needed something,

00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.580
and kept it in My mind.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:52.590
Then I bought that thing and gave it to that person.

00:25:53.510 --> 00:25:58.640
And the amount of love that person gave Me

00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:01.540
was thousand time more

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:09.500
than what I would have got joy out of buying it, by that thing.

00:26:09.630 --> 00:26:13.600
It was so insipid for Me, but for him it was.... He told so

00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:18.540
many people, "Mother gave me this. Mother gave me."

00:26:18.650 --> 00:26:20.720
I mean, I was surprised.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.680
Then they asked Me, "Mother, how did You give him?"

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.670
I said, "Just out of love."

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.580
Many people took to Sahaja Yoga thinking,

00:26:30.670 --> 00:26:33.530
"What a generosity is!"

00:26:33.650 --> 00:26:37.720
So to be generous is the best way to live in this world.

00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.500
After all it's a headache to have too many things.

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:47.710
Better to get rid of them, but out of love.

00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:50.680
If you do that,

00:26:51.570 --> 00:26:56.580
you'll be know how much they'll be appreciative of you.

00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:04.700
Another thing is, to get greed of, to get rid of greed

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:11.620
you should try to do some sort of a collective social work.

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.650
Supposing you go to some place where lots of poor people

00:27:18.510 --> 00:27:22.610
are there, I tell you your greed will just drop out.

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:25.740
You'll be amazed how these people are living,

00:27:26.610 --> 00:27:28.530
in what conditions.

00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.610
"Why do I care for all the wealth and everything?"

00:27:33.590 --> 00:27:36.560
That will be just shocking.

00:27:36.670 --> 00:27:39.620
Sometimes, you see, you see people

00:27:40.730 --> 00:27:44.650
in India also in a very bad condition.

00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:47.670
Once I went to Calcutta

00:27:49.590 --> 00:27:54.700
and I was so -- somehow or other you see by chance,

00:27:55.560 --> 00:28:00.540
I happened to be in places where people were very, in a very,

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:05.650
very great poverty, even the children.

00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.710
And you'll be amazed, for days together I wouldn't eat My food.

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:14.540
I was crying and not eating My food, I just didn't know

00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.600
what to do.

00:28:16.710 --> 00:28:19.720
Because I felt, "What is this?

00:28:20.620 --> 00:28:23.620
Why these people are so poor?"

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:27.620
And I was helpless so I was crying,

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:33.600
that one day I should try to do something for them.

00:28:33.720 --> 00:28:38.510
It is really remarkable, at a very young age of Mine

00:28:38.730 --> 00:28:47.560
I started a leper home, I started a infirmary, a refugee home,

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:50.620
all kinds of things.

00:28:52.580 --> 00:28:57.710
And I never even thought that whatever money I have,

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:06.570
if I give to these people I may have to give up some things.

00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:09.640
I also sold some of My things,

00:29:10.510 --> 00:29:14.630
because so pleasure-giving I tell you, so pleasure-giving,

00:29:15.510 --> 00:29:18.660
so joy-giving to be generous.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:26.560
It is so pain in every way that you should be generous.

00:29:26.730 --> 00:29:29.670
That is the quality of Kubera.

00:29:30.580 --> 00:29:34.570
He's an extremely generous personality,

00:29:35.580 --> 00:29:39.640
and that's what's personality you should be.

00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.650
So, I've seen that Sahaja yogis are very generous.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:50.510
So far nobody has told Me that somebody is a miserly fellow --

00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:53.600
so far, so far.

00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:59.740
But I'm sure one day will come when we'll have people

00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:04.510
of very high quality.

00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:08.580
In Sahaja Yoga we don't say like other cults say that

00:30:08.690 --> 00:30:14.630
you give up your clothes, you give up your family, you stay,

00:30:15.510 --> 00:30:20.740
stay in a forest or in a hut or anything -- nothing of the kind.

00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:24.620
Don't give up anything.

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.720
You have to give up from your heart.

00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:31.720
Just it should happen in your personality;

00:30:32.570 --> 00:30:34.710
don't have to give up.

00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:44.510
And if you have that well-built in spirituality,

00:30:45.520 --> 00:30:52.560
you'll not even think of grabbing someone.

00:30:53.650 --> 00:30:56.600
On the contrary,

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.690
you would like to give up everything.

00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:03.560
My father was even worse than Me, I should say.

00:31:04.610 --> 00:31:07.630
He always used to leave the house open, all doors open.

00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:12.640
He said, "No thief will come in if you keep the doors closed."

00:31:13.500 --> 00:31:15.610
So one day a thief came

00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:19.660
and he took away his gramophone -- in the old times,

00:31:20.510 --> 00:31:23.690
these big horn ones -- he took away.

00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:27.660
The next day My father was sitting, very sad.

00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:29.600
So My mother asked him,

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:31.630
"Why are you sad, because of the gramophone?"

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:35.620
"No, I'm only sad because it seems he is a connoisseur of

00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:42.610
music, he has taken the gramophone but no records."

00:31:43.610 --> 00:31:46.740
So My mother said, "All right, what should we do?

00:31:47.610 --> 00:31:50.560
Should we advertise in the newspaper that you take away

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:53.710
your records?"

00:31:55.650 --> 00:32:01.570
I mean, it's such a beauty, that even after so many years

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:04.720
I am telling you and you are enjoying.

00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:09.720
What a beautiful character it was of generosity.

00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.530
But if you force it through religion,

00:32:15.670 --> 00:32:20.500
through any such ideas that "you give up that, you give" --

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:23.510
don't have to give up.

00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:27.640
You give up from within.

00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:32.620
If you are not attached to it, you have given up.

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:36.560
That much should be there and if you all enjoy your

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.700
generosity and charity, nothing like it!

00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:46.700
I have known people who are very rich and all that,

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:51.540
but they lack generosity.

00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:54.660
That is another quality of Kubera.

00:32:55.530 --> 00:32:58.690
He perhaps understand banking, perhaps.

00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:03.550
That time there were no banks but I think must be,

00:33:03.650 --> 00:33:06.530
because the way He manages banks, you know,

00:33:06.630 --> 00:33:10.580
it seems to Me that He's sitting on top of them,

00:33:10.700 --> 00:33:15.510
and that's why still in the banks there is no problem.

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.710
I don't know.

00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:23.590
But He's a very clever person,

00:33:25.740 --> 00:33:27.720
very intelligent,

00:33:28.590 --> 00:33:30.610
very alert,

00:33:31.650 --> 00:33:36.650
which is important if you have to deal with money --

00:33:37.700 --> 00:33:42.550
though He was absolutely detached from money.

00:33:43.510 --> 00:33:46.520
And just see His life, what He did.

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:51.540
He lived in childhood with His guru,

00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:53.660
and He used to take

00:33:54.540 --> 00:34:03.620
what you call the cows and herds outside in the jungles.

00:34:05.630 --> 00:34:11.630
That is how He lived in His childhood, and later on

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:18.730
He was playing with the boys

00:34:19.580 --> 00:34:23.730
who were looking after the cows in a very,

00:34:24.630 --> 00:34:27.570
I mean, ordinary family.

00:34:31.550 --> 00:34:34.620
He never hankered after money.

00:34:35.590 --> 00:34:36.730
He used to steal,

00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:44.520
used to steal the butter,

00:34:44.710 --> 00:34:50.620
because these ladies used to sell these to Kamsa's

00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:57.550
military people.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:00.600
So He used to eat that,

00:35:00.700 --> 00:35:04.530
so that this lady should not give it to them.

00:35:04.670 --> 00:35:08.590
Just imagine, such a little boy like Him.

00:35:08.710 --> 00:35:15.610
So actually, how He was teaching them a lesson.

00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:19.710
Those ladies were greedy, and wanted to give that

00:35:20.590 --> 00:35:22.720
to these horrible soldiers,

00:35:23.580 --> 00:35:28.570
and He would eat all that butter Himself.

00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:31.620
In everything that He did,

00:35:32.500 --> 00:35:37.650
what you see is extreme generosity, extreme generosity.

00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:44.520
With all His intelligence He, He was so good.

00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:52.700
And He killed

00:35:56.730 --> 00:36:00.710
His own uncle, I should say;

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.590
but for Him it is, was not important,

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:09.660
so-called relations were not important.

00:36:10.630 --> 00:36:13.660
But what you see in our India specially,

00:36:14.540 --> 00:36:16.680
that relations are very important.

00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:21.630
The father is a thief, his son is thief, his grandson is a thief,

00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:26.590
all of them are thieves -- can you imagine?

00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:32.590
I haven't seen in a family if there's one person who is a thief,

00:36:32.690 --> 00:36:37.510
any one his progeny are honest.

00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:42.670
It's a very funny thing, but such greed crawls into their minds

00:36:43.670 --> 00:36:47.650
that they don't think is important.

00:36:48.530 --> 00:36:53.650
They just think that stealing is the only way one can live.

00:36:54.550 --> 00:36:58.690
Though in India there are people who are extremely honest.

00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:00.580
I have seen our servants,

00:37:00.720 --> 00:37:03.680
they never steal anything, nothing, never.

00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:06.710
I don't know, they have no reasoning for it,

00:37:07.570 --> 00:37:09.550
it's a matter of habit.

00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:14.720
They never steal anything -- very surprising.

00:37:18.530 --> 00:37:20.670
Why, why don't they steal?

00:37:21.650 --> 00:37:26.630
They're happy with their lives, they don't want to change it.

00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:32.510
They don't want to have these horrible things

00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:34.690
that can put them in jail.

00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:37.590
But they don't know,

00:37:37.670 --> 00:37:42.500
they don't even think about it; just they just don't do it.

00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.620
Why, because they have a sense of shame.

00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:52.730
In the poorer peoples, sense of shame is very,

00:37:53.570 --> 00:37:55.510
very developed.

00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:03.550
In that society they have a great respect for people who are

00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:06.540
honest, and they are all honest.

00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:10.740
One of them may be not,

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:14.740
but they have no respect for such a person,

00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:20.710
because they think self-respect is the biggest thing.

00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:24.590
Can you imagine these poor people?

00:38:24.700 --> 00:38:28.620
They have food once a day,

00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:32.610
but to them their self-respect is above everything.

00:38:32.720 --> 00:38:38.690
So the third solution for this kind of a nonsensical greed is

00:38:39.700 --> 00:38:42.730
your self-respect.

00:38:43.580 --> 00:38:45.640
Why should you steal,

00:38:45.740 --> 00:38:48.570
why should you have anything that is stolen,

00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.690
or why should you have anything that belongs

00:38:51.530 --> 00:38:53.640
to another person?

00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:56.670
If you have that self-respect within you,

00:38:57.530 --> 00:39:02.580
you won't touch anything that is not yours.

00:39:03.660 --> 00:39:06.710
When the servants can do that, why not people

00:39:07.570 --> 00:39:11.560
who are not that badly off?

00:39:11.670 --> 00:39:17.530
It is a temperament of a higher level, I think,

00:39:17.650 --> 00:39:20.550
which they develop, where their self-respect

00:39:20.670 --> 00:39:25.520
is much more important than all kinds of

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:29.620
other things that may satisfy their greed.

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:35.510
But one thing about greed is, it is never satisfied.

00:39:35.620 --> 00:39:38.500
It is never satisfied.

00:39:38.610 --> 00:39:41.500
I've seen people who were very rich once upon a time,

00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.690
became very, very poor.

00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:47.570
So to them life has become hell.

00:39:47.690 --> 00:39:53.550
They can't live with, without their great,

00:39:54.660 --> 00:39:59.640
I should say, pomp and show,

00:40:00.510 --> 00:40:03.520
but they don't understand that it was false.

00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:08.600
They just go on feeling extremely

00:40:09.610 --> 00:40:13.650
downtrodden when they lose their money.

00:40:14.670 --> 00:40:18.650
Then there are people who want to have money;

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:25.500
they'll do anything but get money.

00:40:25.620 --> 00:40:31.650
It's a very funny thing, but also power is the same as that.

00:40:32.520 --> 00:40:34.650
If you have your own powers,

00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.660
you don't hanker after these powers.

00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.730
But they want to have power because

00:40:40.570 --> 00:40:44.650
they want to have money, and they get power with money --

00:40:44.730 --> 00:40:46.620
can you imagine?

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.720
Where are human beings, at what level?

00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:53.540
At what level of evolution they are?

00:40:53.630 --> 00:40:58.740
They are going round and round the circle of this money.

00:40:59.650 --> 00:41:02.690
This is Nabhi Chakra

00:41:03.550 --> 00:41:05.590
which has to improve,

00:41:05.670 --> 00:41:08.690
which gives you satisfaction.

00:41:09.560 --> 00:41:12.520
If your Nabhi Chakra is satisfied,

00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:16.600
you have achieved the state of Kubera.

00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:20.500
That's very important, to see

00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.730
that your Nabhi should be satisfied.

00:41:26.530 --> 00:41:29.570
There are so many other kinds of things we have,

00:41:29.690 --> 00:41:33.610
but I think now the worst is this greed.

00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:38.630
And this, if it is managed somehow or other,

00:41:38.720 --> 00:41:41.630
brought to its own level,

00:41:41.730 --> 00:41:45.580
then I think world will improve very much.

00:41:45.580 --> 00:41:47.510
May God bless you.
