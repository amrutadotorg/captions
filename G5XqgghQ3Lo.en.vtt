00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:13.434
Today is a very important day in
the history of spirituality.

00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:25.912
The Ekadasha Rudra Incarnation has been
prophesized by every prophet,

00:00:26.113 --> 00:00:36.929
that the Ekadasha Avatara will be coming
and it will destroy all the negativity,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:42.803
all the anti-God activities.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:54.768
Ekadasha Principle actually is built
in [the] Void

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:02.911
because when the saints wanted to cross

00:01:03.669 --> 00:01:10.006
the ocean of illusion through their
meditation,

00:01:11.512 --> 00:01:22.604
they were hindered, troubled, tortured
and slaughtered by negative forces.

00:01:24.422 --> 00:01:28.589
These negative forces came up

00:01:30.795 --> 00:01:38.889
through the failings of human beings.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.132
When human beings failed, they saw
other people

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.346
who were so much better than them

00:01:49.547 --> 00:02:07.942
and they saw that they are nowhere compared
to many other human beings,

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:13.359
or sometimes out of anger and temper

00:02:15.121 --> 00:02:22.689
the villainous temperament grew into them

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:40.543
and then it formed this anti-God negativity
in the Void.

00:02:40.744 --> 00:02:57.233
So Void has given actually the villainy to
come into form.

00:02:59.812 --> 00:03:06.470
As you see, in Sahaja Yoga, we must have
seen it many a times

00:03:06.677 --> 00:03:13.703
that when you go to a wrong guru
or to a wrong person

00:03:13.904 --> 00:03:24.807
or you do unauthorised worshipping,
your left Void catches.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:36.469
So in the left Void all those destructive
forces acted.

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:52.644
Also in the process of evolution, there
were many plants, animals

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:59.518
who were destroyed because they were
not in the centre.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:04.174
Because they were egoistical, some were
cunning,

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:12.757
some were too big, some were too small.
And they were all thrown out.

00:04:12.977 --> 00:04:22.475
And when they were thrown out, they felt
that they must react.

00:04:22.678 --> 00:04:26.234
So they went into the collective
subconscious

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:39.473
and came as subtler entities to harm
the people who were ascending.

00:04:41.015 --> 00:04:44.959
Like we see these days viruses that
attack us.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:49.639
These are the plants which have gone
out of circulation.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:54.632
After some time you will find tobacco
will go out of circulation,

00:04:54.833 --> 00:04:59.878
many drugs will go out of circulation.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:10.185
All these can form a kind of anti-growth,

00:05:10.386 --> 00:05:21.665
anti-development, anti-freedom forces
within ourselves.

00:05:21.866 --> 00:05:33.462
So in the area of Void these horrible
negative forces were formed.

00:05:33.663 --> 00:05:41.830
In the same way, many human beings
who were born

00:05:43.282 --> 00:05:54.275
and tried to assert their ego, went into
egoistical processes

00:05:54.476 --> 00:05:57.689
and thought that they can control people,

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:01.776
they can have their domain over all
the human beings,

00:06:01.977 --> 00:06:07.401
they can overpower the whole world.

00:06:07.602 --> 00:06:19.041
All such people form a very powerful
institutions in the history.

00:06:19.242 --> 00:06:27.533
And today also there are many such forces
coming into existence.

00:06:27.734 --> 00:06:34.166
These forces are building and destroying
every moment;

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:42.449
they are building into our Void area, and
then they are destroyed.

00:06:43.306 --> 00:06:48.511
These people when they come from
the right side,

00:06:48.712 --> 00:06:53.931
from the right Void, we call them
as supra-conscious,

00:06:54.137 --> 00:07:00.750
and those who come from the left side,
we call them as the subconscious entities.

00:07:00.951 --> 00:07:09.559
All these entities do exist, as human
beings are the image of God,

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:16.672
as in the collective subconscious
of God Almighty,

00:07:16.873 --> 00:07:23.921
and also in the supra-conscious of God
Almighty.

00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:29.243
These forces still remain till they go
to hell.

00:07:29.444 --> 00:07:34.904
In the same way in us also, in human
beings also,

00:07:35.105 --> 00:07:43.697
these forces exist and they try
to overpower us.

00:07:45.657 --> 00:07:53.851
It is very remarkable that we had this
Puja in Austria,

00:07:55.335 --> 00:08:08.593
because in the geography of this world
Europe is the Void,

00:08:08.802 --> 00:08:17.114
and in that Austria is the one where we
should have

00:08:17.315 --> 00:08:30.390
anti-negative forces built up
to fight the negative forces.

00:08:30.591 --> 00:08:37.953
It is such a right place to have this Puja.

00:08:38.154 --> 00:08:43.904
And I am really thankful to all the Sahaja
Yogis

00:08:44.112 --> 00:08:49.958
who have chosen this place for Ekadasha
Rudra puja.

00:08:52.623 --> 00:08:57.775
In the modern times as we see today,

00:08:57.976 --> 00:09:04.575
these forces are acting in very subtler
manner,

00:09:04.776 --> 00:09:10.852
in a manner that human beings cannot
understand.

00:09:13.146 --> 00:09:16.502
And they are driven into it.

00:09:16.703 --> 00:09:22.604
If you see the way we are drifting
from reality,

00:09:22.805 --> 00:09:32.304
the way we are getting tempted by
superficial nonsensical things,

00:09:32.505 --> 00:09:39.613
the way we have horrible diseases waiting
at our doorsteps,

00:09:39.814 --> 00:09:49.306
we realize that we are standing on
the verge of falling into a mire,

00:09:49.507 --> 00:09:55.329
from where we may never rise, we may
never come up.

00:09:57.697 --> 00:10:01.447
So we have to understand what is within us

00:10:01.648 --> 00:10:13.935
which can destroy for ever this
anti-development,

00:10:15.379 --> 00:10:28.266
anti-evolutionary, anti-constructive
temperament of the nature.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:39.407
In the nature, if you see, everything
circulates in a very regular manner.

00:10:39.608 --> 00:10:45.710
For example in the winter time the leaves
have to fall down,

00:10:45.911 --> 00:10:54.781
because the nitrogen of the leaves has to go
into the Mother Earth to nourish the trees.

00:10:54.950 --> 00:11:03.171
Moreover the Mother Earth must get
sun’s rays.

00:11:03.372 --> 00:11:09.728
so there should be no leaves and
the sun’s rays can penetrate

00:11:09.929 --> 00:11:13.704
into the Mother Earth to nourish her.

00:11:14.895 --> 00:11:24.993
Then the trees when they are nourished they
again become green and lush

00:11:25.194 --> 00:11:35.585
so that they receive the sun’s light
and make chlorophyll out of them.

00:11:37.254 --> 00:11:46.763
Also they suck in the water from the Mother
Earth and throw them in the atmosphere

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:52.365
to act as catalyst for the rain to come.

00:11:52.566 --> 00:11:55.678
Then the rain comes during the rainy
season,

00:11:55.879 --> 00:12:07.828
then again nourished with water the life
again [starts].

00:12:08.029 --> 00:12:14.709
They lose all their leaves and the whole
circle goes on in a beautiful manner.

00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:19.294
There is no reversion, it is just
a continuous circle

00:12:19.495 --> 00:12:26.062
going in a very beautiful manner to create
and recreate.

00:12:28.182 --> 00:12:37.297
But with the interference of man nature
gets disturbed.

00:12:37.498 --> 00:12:43.132
Also you can enhance the nature,

00:12:43.497 --> 00:12:50.236
you can save the nature’s destruction
which could be natural also.

00:12:51.996 --> 00:12:59.356
But when you get your realisation, when
you get your realisation,

00:12:59.557 --> 00:13:06.136
then with your vibrations you can save
all natural things

00:13:06.337 --> 00:13:11.557
that are decaying under the modern
influence.

00:13:11.811 --> 00:13:18.448
So first of all, we see the effect
of realisation

00:13:18.649 --> 00:13:23.635
how it acts as Ekadasha Rudra.

00:13:23.836 --> 00:13:35.042
It destroys the negative forces which are
trying to destroy the nature.

00:13:38.245 --> 00:13:43.156
One day I am sure you all will evolve
to such a state

00:13:43.357 --> 00:13:51.682
that even your glance is sufficient
to make the trees grow,

00:13:51.883 --> 00:13:59.704
to make the fruits sweet, to make
the flowers fragrant.

00:14:00.521 --> 00:14:08.286
That’s possible because our growth
is showing results.

00:14:08.487 --> 00:14:11.669
Slowly, slowly it is showing results,

00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:15.384
because you should not be stunned, you
should not be shocked,

00:14:15.601 --> 00:14:22.640
so that you can see for yourself what you
are and what you are achieving.

00:14:24.962 --> 00:14:29.069
But to allow this force within us to grow,

00:14:29.270 --> 00:14:34.386
first of all, we should be very
introspective,

00:14:34.633 --> 00:14:41.629
we should try to see ourselves, what is
happening to us?

00:14:41.830 --> 00:14:44.229
We must watch our steps.

00:14:44.472 --> 00:14:51.985
Are we moving towards our construction
or towards our destruction?

00:14:52.186 --> 00:14:55.037
What are we doing?

00:14:55.238 --> 00:15:00.644
This Ekadasha Rudra force which is
within us

00:15:00.845 --> 00:15:04.954
is so powerful, is so very powerful

00:15:05.155 --> 00:15:13.432
that not only in nature but also in human
beings it acts.

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:25.141
It acts in a way that you are shocked and
surprised at.

00:15:25.342 --> 00:15:29.789
There is a gentleman whom I had given
realisation, he’s very dedicated,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:35.452
but he is not in a place where he can come
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:35.653 --> 00:15:40.120
And some people tried to trouble him very
much.

00:15:40.321 --> 00:15:42.298
And he told Me they all met with
an accident

00:15:42.499 --> 00:15:46.952
and all of them are now lying
in the hospital.

00:15:47.657 --> 00:15:50.839
So I said, “I didn’t do anything.

00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:00.277
By their own doings they have crossed
the limits.”

00:16:00.478 --> 00:16:06.508
And if you cross the limits of goodness,
naturally you go [grow] something

00:16:06.709 --> 00:16:09.794
what we call as evil.

00:16:09.995 --> 00:16:16.228
And if you fall into the ditches of evil,
you have to suffer.

00:16:17.576 --> 00:16:21.835
But also it acts on Sahaja Yogis.

00:16:22.036 --> 00:16:28.089
I have known of a Sahaja Yogi who tried
to be little funny about money.

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:32.339
I did not think that he should be punished.
I never thought of such a thing,

00:16:32.540 --> 00:16:36.911
that he should be punished, really,
but they acted,

00:16:37.112 --> 00:16:42.488
his own forces acted against him.

00:16:42.689 --> 00:16:46.867
And he got so sick, so very sick

00:16:47.068 --> 00:16:53.420
that in My presence he used to just shake
like a dried leaf.

00:16:56.206 --> 00:17:01.221
I never even told him that, “I know
what you are doing.”

00:17:04.779 --> 00:17:08.587
In Sahaja Yoga when you enter,
you have to know

00:17:08.788 --> 00:17:16.488
that slowly and steadily you are climbing
up a very steep road.

00:17:16.689 --> 00:17:27.344
Because it has to be very quick, so
the rise is very steep.

00:17:27.545 --> 00:17:30.928
And when you are climbing up that rise,

00:17:31.129 --> 00:17:36.838
you have to know, if you don’t go further
you’ll slip down.

00:17:37.039 --> 00:17:42.109
But if you move sideways you will
fall down.

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:52.161
You may say that, “Mother, we are moving
sideways, so there is a movement”,

00:17:52.362 --> 00:17:57.637
because you’re falling down also one may
feel the movement.

00:17:57.963 --> 00:18:01.222
That is the movement of destruction.

00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.734
So you must have proper discretion about
yourself.

00:18:04.935 --> 00:18:09.503
Are we ascending or descending?

00:18:09.704 --> 00:18:18.945
Are we losing our steps? Are we going
higher in our steps?

00:18:19.146 --> 00:18:23.088
Which sometimes we do not realize

00:18:23.289 --> 00:18:34.566
that we are amidst the worst possible
negativity in the history of this universe.

00:18:34.759 --> 00:18:39.852
In the olden times there would be only one
rakshasa at a time one had to deal with.

00:18:40.053 --> 00:18:44.688
It was so easy to deal with one rakshasa.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:57.111
But to deal with so many of them already
needs lot of work.

00:18:57.312 --> 00:19:01.285
But the worst part about it is that
in the modern times

00:19:01.486 --> 00:19:07.272
these rakshasas have entered into
the brains of people.

00:19:07.473 --> 00:19:14.776
Because of their teachings, because of
their delusions people have accepted them,

00:19:14.977 --> 00:19:18.037
and these people are My children.

00:19:18.238 --> 00:19:22.660
They are seekers, they are seekers
of Truth.

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:31.066
It’s like people using children for
a ransom.

00:19:31.891 --> 00:19:38.981
They put the children before Me and I don’t
know what to do:

00:19:39.149 --> 00:19:45.779
if I try to kill the devils, then
the children are in front.

00:19:47.047 --> 00:19:51.863
So which is the best way is to destroy
in modern times?

00:19:52.064 --> 00:19:55.410
Of course, they can be killed, they can
die,

00:19:55.611 --> 00:20:01.969
but how am I to save the people whom they
have polluted, whom they have wronged?

00:20:02.170 --> 00:20:09.145
It’s a very, very difficult and very
delicate work.

00:20:10.589 --> 00:20:17.096
For that there’s only way is to bring them

00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:24.141
to a point where they get completely
exposed, they are debased,

00:20:24.351 --> 00:20:30.843
and the whole world knows who are they,
how they look like.

00:20:31.049 --> 00:20:38.474
So instead of fighting them from outside or
just asking Yama to go and kill them,

00:20:38.675 --> 00:20:51.261
is best is to make their own being caught
into the web of Ekadasha Rudra,

00:20:51.462 --> 00:20:57.260
so that they are exposed to people by their
misdeed.

00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:06.237
That is the advantage, I should say, a part
of the ugly game of falsehood.

00:21:06.438 --> 00:21:09.808
Falsehood always gets exposed.

00:21:10.009 --> 00:21:16.941
You can see written large on their faces
their hypocrisy,

00:21:17.142 --> 00:21:25.938
their evil intentions and their satanic
schemes.

00:21:27.973 --> 00:21:34.991
As I said that modern times are the worst
for these attacks.

00:21:35.192 --> 00:21:42.143
We have to be more alert, more aware,
more understanding.

00:21:42.344 --> 00:21:47.554
As Sahaja Yogis you all are very well
equipped.

00:21:47.721 --> 00:21:54.328
but we all the time forget that we have
got our vibrations,

00:21:54.529 --> 00:21:58.667
that we have got a new awareness
of vibrations.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:05.018
We have got vibratory awareness and this
vibratory awareness

00:22:05.219 --> 00:22:14.541
are a kind of a messenger which is
absolute,

00:22:14.773 --> 00:22:17.497
which communicates and which tells us

00:22:17.698 --> 00:22:21.571
what’s wrong with others, what’s wrong
with us.

00:22:21.772 --> 00:22:34.209
But if you start taking your decision
through your mental, emotional enterprises,

00:22:34.410 --> 00:22:44.579
then be sure that you’ll be misguided,
because all these endeavours are one-sided.

00:22:44.780 --> 00:22:50.298
Like a mental projection goes like this in
a linear way, falls upon you;

00:22:50.499 --> 00:22:58.610
and also an emotional one does the same.
Even the physical is just the same.

00:22:58.818 --> 00:23:02.451
But when you start seeing through
the vibrations,

00:23:02.652 --> 00:23:08.491
what do you do is to ask your Spirit
to communicate to you,

00:23:08.692 --> 00:23:13.171
and the Spirit is the absolute knowledge.

00:23:13.372 --> 00:23:18.704
So you do not succumb to your conditioning
or to your ego

00:23:18.905 --> 00:23:25.552
or to any other training or any other guru
but yourself.

00:23:25.753 --> 00:23:30.137
So it is very important for all of you

00:23:30.883 --> 00:23:35.648
to understand that we are not going to take
any decision

00:23:35.837 --> 00:23:42.530
on our mental level but on our vibrations.

00:23:43.236 --> 00:23:47.907
Many people think that if I say something
about someone,

00:23:48.108 --> 00:23:52.962
[it] may be because they have reported it
to Me.

00:23:55.510 --> 00:23:59.318
But supposing if I am the source of all
the vibrations,

00:23:59.519 --> 00:24:03.838
what is there for Me to get reported?

00:24:05.661 --> 00:24:08.476
Why should anybody report to Me? If they
want to report they may,

00:24:08.677 --> 00:24:12.513
but I know what exactly is the situation.

00:24:12.714 --> 00:24:20.815
Once in Rahuri I was waiting in the Guest
House

00:24:21.016 --> 00:24:26.208
and about five, six professors came
on their bikes.

00:24:26.409 --> 00:24:29.740
[They] came and told Me, “Mother, we have
come to warn You

00:24:29.941 --> 00:24:34.943
about a particular gentleman.” I said,
“Who is this gentleman?”

00:24:35.144 --> 00:24:37.127
They gave the name of this gentleman

00:24:37.328 --> 00:24:41.544
and said, “You have to be very careful,
he is a politician.”

00:24:41.745 --> 00:24:46.271
I said, “Alright, that’s all you know about
him?” They said, “Yes.

00:24:46.472 --> 00:24:50.324
So you have to be very careful.”
I said, “Now I’ll tell you about him,

00:24:50.525 --> 00:24:55.918
that this man has not married his ‘wife’.

00:24:56.119 --> 00:25:00.880
She is the wife of somebody else and he has
eloped with this woman.

00:25:01.104 --> 00:25:03.996
And the child is his,

00:25:04.197 --> 00:25:08.059
but this lady was raped by him, that’s how
he’s got the child.”

00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:11.078
When I started telling, you know, they all
started

00:25:11.279 --> 00:25:14.637
raising their eyebrows and opening
their eyes.

00:25:14.838 --> 00:25:18.658
They said,: “Mother, how do you know?”
I said, “You go and find out

00:25:18.866 --> 00:25:27.452
whatever I am saying, is it true or not.”
They were completely stunned.

00:25:27.653 --> 00:25:30.257
They went back and then reported to Me

00:25:30.458 --> 00:25:35.561
that, “Mother, it’s surprising, what You
said was the truth.”

00:25:35.762 --> 00:25:41.419
So on vibrations you can know everything,

00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:47.079
but those who try to decide things without
vibrations,

00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:51.021
can make mistakes, till you reach
a certain stage

00:25:51.222 --> 00:25:56.075
where you don’t have to spread your hands
to ask, just you will know.

00:25:56.394 --> 00:25:59.788
But to go to that stage you have to,
first of all, surrender

00:25:59.989 --> 00:26:04.989
your discretion to vibrations.

00:26:05.672 --> 00:26:09.194
Now some people don’t have proper
vibrations.

00:26:09.395 --> 00:26:15.060
Maybe their Vishuddhis are bad. They should
take proper care of their Vishuddhis.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:18.657
Even then, if they don’t have some physical
problem on the Vishuddhi,

00:26:18.858 --> 00:26:23.106
they can feel it within themselves what
chakras are catching,

00:26:23.307 --> 00:26:30.177
what is happening to this gentleman.
Normally, because we are in modern times,

00:26:30.378 --> 00:26:36.413
the people who are possessed

00:26:36.621 --> 00:26:41.740
appear more beautiful than the people
who are not possessed.

00:26:41.941 --> 00:26:45.724
Once we had a lady who came to us
in our programme.

00:26:45.925 --> 00:26:51.087
She was completely possessed, thin like
a beanstalk, absolutely,

00:26:51.288 --> 00:26:54.341
and everybody – that was the beginning
of Sahaja Yoga –

00:26:54.542 --> 00:26:57.602
felt that what a beautiful woman has come.

00:26:57.803 --> 00:27:01.174
When I told them to keep her out
of the hall for the time being,

00:27:01.375 --> 00:27:04.521
they couldn’t understand.

00:27:05.338 --> 00:27:10.008
Then she got cured and she looks
very different now,

00:27:10.209 --> 00:27:16.137
to Me she is very beautiful. The beauty
that was seen at that time

00:27:16.338 --> 00:27:20.841
must have been the camouflage
of the negativity that people saw.

00:27:21.042 --> 00:27:25.179
Like as you see these cinema actresses,
cinema actors

00:27:25.380 --> 00:27:31.624
and some of the clowns who move
as presidents, this, that.

00:27:31.825 --> 00:27:37.236
You can see it written large on their
faces, how horrid they are.

00:27:37.437 --> 00:27:44.739
But unless and until you yourself are
of that level and sincere,

00:27:44.940 --> 00:27:47.956
you won’t be able to make it out.

00:27:48.157 --> 00:27:55.503
Today what we are doing is to awaken within
us this Ekadasha Rudra force,

00:27:55.704 --> 00:27:59.732
which will help you to fight your own
negativity

00:27:59.933 --> 00:28:02.914
and fight the negativity of the whole
world.

00:28:03.122 --> 00:28:07.037
Now we have so many hands,
so many people

00:28:07.238 --> 00:28:12.275
with different what we call them ayudha,
means the weapons.

00:28:12.476 --> 00:28:16.749
All these weapons are with you, they are
within you

00:28:16.950 --> 00:28:20.973
and you can definitely use them,

00:28:21.174 --> 00:28:26.508
but first you must know what weapons
you are carrying and how to use them.

00:28:26.709 --> 00:28:32.492
There’s so much blind faith. There is
so much of wrong ideas,

00:28:32.693 --> 00:28:39.698
so much of organisational fortresses they
have built.

00:28:39.899 --> 00:28:45.774
All kinds of nonsensical things are going
on in this world,

00:28:47.801 --> 00:28:53.651
but they’ll all be finished. Nobody will
know anything about them

00:28:53.852 --> 00:29:00.951
except that they might know [be known] as
some villainous creatures on this earth.

00:29:01.152 --> 00:29:06.269
Ultimately the living will exist.

00:29:06.470 --> 00:29:08.888
We have to know that we know the living
force

00:29:09.089 --> 00:29:11.609
and we have to be very sure about it

00:29:11.840 --> 00:29:18.000
and we have to be proud about it that we
know what is the living force.

00:29:18.201 --> 00:29:26.089
Then this Ekadasha Rudra within us becomes
very strong.

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:32.857
Anybody who tries to trouble you will have
a nice punch.

00:29:33.864 --> 00:29:38.953
Any organisation which tries to subdue
Sahaja Yoga

00:29:39.154 --> 00:29:45.379
or in any way harm it, will have a nice
time.

00:29:45.580 --> 00:29:50.156
Like you know, I went for Merv Griffin
Show and he misbehaved.

00:29:50.357 --> 00:29:55.855
Next week that show was closed down.
No more.

00:29:56.056 --> 00:30:01.294
In India there was a newspaper which tried
to make a funny article out of Me.

00:30:01.495 --> 00:30:08.032
The newspaper was closed down for months
together, just it happens.

00:30:08.199 --> 00:30:14.410
I don’t say anything of the kind, but
the way things happen is very surprising

00:30:14.611 --> 00:30:21.489
how this Ekadasha is now active.

00:30:21.690 --> 00:30:28.625
Also the most significant thing is that
this Ekadasha is going to act

00:30:28.826 --> 00:30:34.184
only in Kali Yuga, in these modern times.

00:30:34.385 --> 00:30:43.687
Earlier it was not going to act because
there was hardly one guru -

00:30:43.888 --> 00:30:48.373
who is today a ‘guru’, must have been
the Satan last time -

00:30:48.550 --> 00:30:59.211
only one horrible rakshasa there,
so it was very easy to kill him.

00:30:59.441 --> 00:31:06.307
To kill Kamsa it took no time for
Shri Krishna,

00:31:06.508 --> 00:31:11.780
or to kill Ravana it took no time for
Shri Rama.

00:31:11.981 --> 00:31:17.739
And once they have killed, the whole thing
becomes clean start.

00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:23.900
But here they are like mosquitoes. So many
of them!

00:31:24.101 --> 00:31:27.692
One after the another, there’s no end
to it.

00:31:27.893 --> 00:31:31.374
And they have entered also into the being
of human beings

00:31:31.575 --> 00:31:35.432
giving them diseases, all kinds of problems
and tortures.

00:31:35.617 --> 00:31:41.979
So the problem is much more deeper and
very very complicated.

00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:49.012
That is why Ekadasha Rudra, which has got
eleven destroying powers.

00:31:49.213 --> 00:31:53.636
We say that there are ten

00:31:55.961 --> 00:32:02.937
(Hindi) directions, you can say,

00:32:03.364 --> 00:32:11.827
and this is the eleventh. So ten from
outside, one from inside.

00:32:12.028 --> 00:32:18.797
All these eleven forces can act on to
anyone

00:32:19.006 --> 00:32:23.495
who tries to hamper the progress of Sahaja
Yoga

00:32:23.696 --> 00:32:28.546
or even to say something against Me
or against you people.

00:32:28.747 --> 00:32:33.730
Anybody who tries to trouble you it will
act.

00:32:35.699 --> 00:32:41.458
On the physical level it appears on your
forehead here.

00:32:41.659 --> 00:32:47.182
The Ekadasha Rudra shows on your forehead,
and you get a swelling over here.

00:32:47.383 --> 00:32:51.077
Some people, you must have seen, have
a furrow here

00:32:51.278 --> 00:32:55.006
and a huge, big thing coming out.

00:32:55.207 --> 00:32:59.014
Mostly the cancer patients, if you see
them, they have

00:32:59.222 --> 00:33:03.988
from left it rises to the right side quite
a lot,

00:33:04.189 --> 00:33:09.052
a bump there, on the right hand side,

00:33:09.253 --> 00:33:13.250
and there are some who have got
on the left hand side.

00:33:13.427 --> 00:33:17.692
So from the left hand side it rises, goes
to the right side,

00:33:17.893 --> 00:33:21.845
and the one which rises from the right side
goes to the left side.

00:33:22.046 --> 00:33:25.508
So the more dangerous ones are which go
to the right side,

00:33:25.709 --> 00:33:31.656
because they are the ones who are very sly,
which we cannot see,

00:33:31.857 --> 00:33:37.378
which are hiding, which can harm you
very much.

00:33:37.579 --> 00:33:44.018
So all these horrible things that are
acting today

00:33:44.219 --> 00:33:54.760
can be completely destroyed if we develop
our Ekadasha Rudra within ourselves.

00:33:56.340 --> 00:34:04.631
They are not so powerful: one Sahaja Yogi
can kill thousands of them,

00:34:05.115 --> 00:34:11.010
while they cannot harm even one
Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:11.211 --> 00:34:21.207
So they are really powerless before you,
they have no way of torturing you.

00:34:21.408 --> 00:34:30.245
In case you are a powerful person, they
will all disappear and disappear forever.

00:34:30.446 --> 00:34:34.628
I remember once there were three Sahaja
Yogis in India

00:34:34.829 --> 00:34:39.824
who used to go by a particular road
in a village.

00:34:40.025 --> 00:34:46.188
So one lady got possessed and she started
doing, “Ho, ho, ho,” like that.

00:34:46.389 --> 00:34:52.866
So they said, “Why are you here?” She said,
“We are here in this lady to tell you

00:34:53.067 --> 00:34:56.904
that please tell these three Sahaja Yogis
not to go by that road,

00:34:57.105 --> 00:35:00.686
because now we have run away from all
the villages

00:35:00.887 --> 00:35:05.204
and we are just residing in that area, and
if the Sahaja Yogis go through that also

00:35:05.405 --> 00:35:08.504
the whole night we’ll be jumping around.

00:35:08.705 --> 00:35:11.756
So better ask these three Sahaja Yogis not
to come that way

00:35:11.957 --> 00:35:17.466
so that at least we’ll have some place
to reside.”

00:35:18.631 --> 00:35:23.258
These are, as I told you, gone out of
the circulation of evolution,

00:35:23.459 --> 00:35:27.203
so these are dead, dead people.

00:35:27.404 --> 00:35:34.960
And these dead people can in their subtle
bodies enter into us and form entities

00:35:35.161 --> 00:35:39.863
and those entities can grab us and can
possess us.

00:35:40.064 --> 00:35:42.796
Such possessed people look quite normal.

00:35:42.997 --> 00:35:51.667
As I was saying today homosexuality,
over sexuality, no sexuality,

00:35:51.868 --> 00:36:07.119
then we can say no aesthetics, or too much
of artistic tendencies.

00:36:07.320 --> 00:36:15.275
Then we can say too much of eating
and hunger

00:36:15.476 --> 00:36:23.719
or eating nothing at all, fasting.

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:29.554
Then not afraid of anyone, “What’s wrong?”,
for everything, “What’s wrong?”,

00:36:29.755 --> 00:36:36.833
not afraid of God, or afraid of even
an ant.

00:36:37.198 --> 00:36:41.698
Then there are people who feel guilty
all the time,

00:36:41.899 --> 00:36:46.005
or those who make others feel guilty

00:36:46.206 --> 00:36:51.032
as if the other person is good for nothing
– they too.

00:36:51.233 --> 00:36:58.588
Plus we have another kind who are very,
very cruel,

00:36:58.789 --> 00:37:03.661
that they can entrap people, can make
their own slaves,

00:37:03.862 --> 00:37:09.251
can work out anything horrible, wars,
by their own talking.

00:37:09.452 --> 00:37:14.399
And there are others who subjugate
themselves to these evil people

00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:21.465
and accept their dominance and try
to destroy other people

00:37:21.666 --> 00:37:27.173
in the glory of these dominating
personalities.

00:37:27.374 --> 00:37:33.579
Then comes the area of Sahaja Yoga

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:40.760
where nobody can enter in, you are
perfectly happy there.

00:37:40.961 --> 00:37:48.770
Ekadeshas are standing round you on your
forehead to look after that area.

00:37:48.971 --> 00:37:54.041
They are watching you, they are guards,
and nobody can harm you.

00:37:54.242 --> 00:37:57.859
You are very nicely settled down there
in the Sahastrara,

00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:08.044
and nothing can touch you, nothing can
even bring a slur on you.

00:38:08.245 --> 00:38:15.011
They are very alert and they have
many facets -

00:38:15.212 --> 00:38:21.652
each deity has many facets - and all these
facets are all the time

00:38:21.862 --> 00:38:30.472
throwing light in that area so that there
is no intruder to enter in.

00:38:30.674 --> 00:38:35.502
This is what you have got within yourself.

00:38:35.703 --> 00:38:42.171
And when anybody tries to enter into this
area of Sahastrara,

00:38:42.372 --> 00:38:48.101
immediately they react and can harm
the other man to such an extent

00:38:48.302 --> 00:38:53.622
that you are yourself amazed and you don’t
know how it has happened.

00:38:53.823 --> 00:38:58.749
But to develop this force we have
to meditate with sincerity,

00:38:58.950 --> 00:39:03.758
with understanding. Not with just words
before the photograph to say,

00:39:03.959 --> 00:39:08.429
“Mother, I surrender myself to You”,
this, that. Sincerely.

00:39:08.630 --> 00:39:12.485
Because the deities know who is sincere,
who is innate,

00:39:12.686 --> 00:39:18.980
who is the one who is really trying to rise
and ascend.

00:39:19.181 --> 00:39:23.501
It is a struggle in a way. It is a struggle

00:39:23.702 --> 00:39:29.121
but it is not the struggle which will not
bring you any fruits.

00:39:29.322 --> 00:39:33.145
Otherwise, all other struggles give you
no fruits.

00:39:33.346 --> 00:39:39.570
But this struggle is so simple and so
already explained

00:39:39.771 --> 00:39:44.088
and worked out that you don’t have
to worry too much.

00:39:44.289 --> 00:39:52.909
So today, we have to invite all these
forces of Ekadasha Rudra

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:57.827
to destroy the negativity in this Kali Yuga
completely.

00:39:58.028 --> 00:40:02.300
Also to pray that if there is any
negativity within us,

00:40:02.501 --> 00:40:04.586
it should be destroyed.

00:40:04.787 --> 00:40:08.904
If there is any negativity against Sahaja
Yoga, it should be destroyed.

00:40:09.105 --> 00:40:12.257
Anywhere in our character and in our
understanding,

00:40:12.458 --> 00:40:15.335
if there is any negativity, it should be
destroyed.

00:40:15.506 --> 00:40:19.883
This is today’s message for you on Ekadasha
Rudra.

00:40:20.105 --> 00:40:23.367
May God bless you.
