00:00:44.224 --> 00:00:47.775
This is a special month in India

00:00:48.624 --> 00:00:54.344
 and it is nice that we are organizing this program during this month

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.054
 called as the Margasheersha,

00:00:57.852 --> 00:01:03.080
 means where Marga means the road and Sheersha is the head,

00:01:03.342 --> 00:01:10.342
 which leads you to the Epitome,

00:01:11.344 --> 00:01:15.780
that's the month. And in this month they worship

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:20.488
Guru because of His birthday of Dattatreya

00:01:20.806 --> 00:01:24.488
and also they worship Mahalakshmi.

00:01:27.268 --> 00:01:31.944
That means this is the month of Shushumna,

00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:37.261
where the people get out of

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:45.791
the bondages of smaller hankerings

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:53.066
 and enter into a new path of seeking

00:01:54.058 --> 00:01:57.653
 of Spirituality  that is Shushumna that is Mahalakshmi.

00:01:58.266 --> 00:02:08.149
 Also on this, there are lots of  Pujas

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:15.167
they do for four Thursdays,  the Puja of Mahalakshmi

00:02:15.477 --> 00:02:19.655
 because Mahalakshmi is worshipped on a Thursday

00:02:19.988 --> 00:02:23.892
 as it is the essence of the Guru principle.

00:02:27.471 --> 00:02:31.272
The Gurus have to satisfy the Mahalakshmi

00:02:31.687 --> 00:02:35.449
 principle, which is just pure seeking of God,

00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:38.538
or what do you call the Shuddha Ichha.

00:02:40.977 --> 00:02:48.522
Today is the Saturday as I enquired and the Puja was done in Poona

00:02:50.162 --> 00:02:55.293
was also  on Thursday.

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:00.862
Thursday puja was the thing of the Mahalakshmi's Puja is started.

00:03:01.505 --> 00:03:05.687
 The day we did  puja in Mahalakshmi, there,

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:13.262
you saw hole  the water was giving away its exuberance

00:03:13.701 --> 00:03:19.660
 by putting up miraculous fountains.

00:03:20.605 --> 00:03:23.474
And they became the clouds I believe

00:03:24.138 --> 00:03:28.442
because I heard at the time of the puja

00:03:29.775 --> 00:03:33.699
 rain started in Rahuri and it rained and rained and rained.

00:03:34.493 --> 00:03:38.762
 And now this country which is under drought,

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:42.409
 people  don't even have water to drink we have rain.

00:03:42.926 --> 00:03:49.580
 So the whole thing works out according to the calendar

00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:53.975
which is devised by God, not by human beings.

00:03:54.841 --> 00:03:58.099
So today is an another day of Saturday,

00:03:59.313 --> 00:04:04.088
where we are sitting on the bank of Krishna river.

00:04:04.851 --> 00:04:06.689
See how it works out?

00:04:07.078 --> 00:04:10.704
 Krishna river represents the power of Shri Krishna.

00:04:13.462 --> 00:04:18.390
 So the Mahalakshmi Tattwa has to go to the Krishna's state,

00:04:20.634 --> 00:04:24.693
of the witness state and that's how we are here today

00:04:24.955 --> 00:04:29.114
on this special occasion in Brahmapuri,

00:04:29.642 --> 00:04:33.723
also the word Brahmapuri means where you feel the Brahma,

00:04:33.977 --> 00:04:37.160
the Chaitanya which you can feel it on this earth.

00:04:39.871 --> 00:04:46.583
 So when we are touring we are actually also internally, moving.

00:04:48.623 --> 00:04:52.403
Also there is Anthar Yoga which you are achieving.

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:56.932
So you should not mind little, little things here and there

00:04:57.448 --> 00:05:00.416
 but enjoy every bit of it.

00:05:00.884 --> 00:05:04.186
Yesterday also I was happy you all danced

00:05:04.663 --> 00:05:09.115
because yesterday was the day of Shakti, was the Friday.

00:05:09.714 --> 00:05:14.021
 On the day of Shakti if you dance you will get that power within yourself.

00:05:14.564 --> 00:05:18.652
And that's why you are looking much better now.

00:05:20.335 --> 00:05:24.229
 In My name if you dance you get the power, no doubt about it.

00:05:25.126 --> 00:05:29.950
And that's why here you have to achieve your Spiritual power,

00:05:30.666 --> 00:05:34.758
your Spiritual peace and your Spiritual love.

00:05:36.584 --> 00:05:39.734
All these things if you can achieve in India

00:05:40.123 --> 00:05:43.871
you have done full justice to Me and to yourself.

00:05:45.609 --> 00:05:49.275
It is not just a picnic or an outing, nothing of the kind,

00:05:50.442 --> 00:05:56.033
and working out internally all of you, now I am sure it will work out.

00:05:56.528 --> 00:06:01.769
So have loving attitude towards all the other people

00:06:02.397 --> 00:06:08.538
 who are here, who are feeling lots of love for you

00:06:09.108 --> 00:06:13.384
 and they pay lot of attention, they don't want you to do any hard work

00:06:13.591 --> 00:06:17.103
they want to look after you but you also try to make friends

00:06:17.413 --> 00:06:21.614
and try to know them, hardly you know their names, hardly,

00:06:21.971 --> 00:06:25.016
 you write to them. That's not proper.

00:06:25.318 --> 00:06:27.641
 So at least those who have been here many a times,

00:06:27.856 --> 00:06:29.919
should try to know the names of the people,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:33.131
 take their addresses and they may also write to you

00:06:33.385 --> 00:06:35.080
 and you may also write to them.

00:06:35.271 --> 00:06:38.303
So that you maintain a proper correspondence.

00:06:39.374 --> 00:06:41.962
So this relationship, of friendship and love

00:06:42.497 --> 00:06:45.111
 must be started as Shri Krishna has said

00:06:45.381 --> 00:06:48.682
that unless and until you love each other

00:06:49.598 --> 00:06:51.669
I do not exist with in you.

00:06:52.272 --> 00:06:55.497
 So it is not only one country, it is not many countries,

00:06:55.677 --> 00:06:59.037
 it's all the countries of the world have to love each other

00:06:59.267 --> 00:07:02.231
and to understand each other as yogis.

00:07:02.461 --> 00:07:05.069
 You are all yogis and to be appreciated.

00:07:05.498 --> 00:07:10.072
They are already singing the praises of you since long

00:07:10.744 --> 00:07:14.926
 and now it is time to prove it.

00:07:15.704 --> 00:07:18.942
 The other day I described to them the procession

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:23.309
that was described by one of the English poets

00:07:24.222 --> 00:07:27.504
 in his vision he saw our procession and when I told them

00:07:27.732 --> 00:07:31.643
they are very happy that already an English poet like Lewis could

00:07:31.897 --> 00:07:35.983
 see these points and written in such details the whole description.

00:07:36.309 --> 00:07:39.697
But that book has not arrived in India, Vision.  It is a beautiful book

00:07:39.999 --> 00:07:43.774
 and I would request the Australians to, if possible

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:46.772
to make some copies of that and handed it over,

00:07:47.003 --> 00:07:49.550
 at least the typed copies,

00:07:49.820 --> 00:07:53.404
 in Southara or in Sangli somehow if you have the book with you

00:07:54.031 --> 00:07:57.399
and give it to them. They will be very happy, know all about it.

00:07:57.693 --> 00:08:04.757
 That will be a special present to the people of Ganapatipule.

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.552
If you could give the exact,  book

00:08:11.003 --> 00:08:14.600
then somebody can do it in Southara and can do it in one day  in India

00:08:14.830 --> 00:08:17.766
 these things can be done very easily in India.

00:08:18.496 --> 00:08:20.689
 We don't book things as you have to book.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:24.141
We have started but not so much of booking this year.

00:08:24.672 --> 00:08:26.712
So I request you do that much,

00:08:26.935 --> 00:08:30.132
give the book to these people, so they will bring it printed

00:08:30.331 --> 00:08:32.505
 and everybody can have it.
