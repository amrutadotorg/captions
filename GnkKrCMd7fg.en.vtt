Public Program Day 1, Seekers are the Highest Creation

00:00:05.274 --> 00:00:09.022
Heartwood Community Center, Santa Cruz (United States)
17-10-1981

00:19:32.430 --> 00:19:42.950
I am very fortunate and I am very happy that
I could come to Santa Cruz.

00:19:42.950 --> 00:19:54.830
I can see what I am facing is the ocean of
Love, the seekers of Love, the people who

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:58.120
are seeking the Truth.

00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:04.699
Gregoire has told you all these things because
he is very earnest, he is very concerned,

00:20:04.724 --> 00:20:10.120
he knows you are seekers and that’s why
he has told you in these words, so don’t

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:11.120
be frightened.

00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.580
There is nothing to be frightened about anything.

00:20:15.580 --> 00:20:22.370
You are seekers and you are a special category.

00:20:22.370 --> 00:20:28.080
In the eyes of God, seekers are the highest
creation that He has created.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.090
You are the highest of all.

00:20:33.090 --> 00:20:46.500
To Him it does not matter who are rich, who
are in power, who are leading a life of so-called

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:47.500
success.

00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:51.190
It does not matter to Him at all, He does
not understand that, He does not know that.

00:20:51.190 --> 00:20:57.180
Christ has said that these people if they
want gold, let them have.

00:20:57.461 --> 00:21:01.640
They’ll have bars of gold and live with
it.

00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:16.000
But “if they seek Me, if they love Me,”
then these people who are seekers today are

00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.180
going to enter into the Kingdom of God and
He will eat with them.

00:21:21.180 --> 00:21:26.980
They will sit at the same table.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:30.540
You are respected because you are seekers.

00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:33.760
You are loved because you are seekers.

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:41.910
And you have survived despite all the attacks
on you.

00:21:41.910 --> 00:21:43.903
These are all attacks.

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:49.380
You are naîve, you are simple, you were innocent
at that time when attacks came in.

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:54.519
Now gradually you are discovering that it
was an attack.

00:21:54.722 --> 00:22:00.240
Everything that you did was just to put you
down.

00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:08.800
And one person who was negative of that kind
would come forward and assert and use all

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.460
the negative forces to push you down.

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:19.320
To me you are my children.

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:28.320
To me I don’t think what you have done because
you didn’t meet me that time.

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.740
I take the load upon myself.

00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:34.789
I did come to San Jose last time.

00:22:35.328 --> 00:22:44.020
They said that there are lots of seekers settling
down in Santa Cruz.

00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:56.410
I wanted to come and see you here that time
only, but the experience I had of the people

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:01.170
who were there, I thought, “They are not
just now seeking God, but they are sort of

00:23:01.170 --> 00:23:10.270
seeking ego or superego, they are seeking
into a new style of life and a new style of

00:23:10.270 --> 00:23:14.330
understanding, because they have found out
that material life is of no value, it’s

00:23:14.330 --> 00:23:17.100
not going to give them joy."

00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:22.174
At that time, when I said that, and you are
thinking of these things, how can you pay

00:23:22.199 --> 00:23:23.254
for it?

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:26.330
Nobody could understand these things.

00:23:26.330 --> 00:23:31.056
It was very difficult to talk to them – that
it is spontaneous, it is your own right, that

00:23:31.081 --> 00:23:32.990
you have to get it.

00:23:32.990 --> 00:23:36.440
You have been seeking for ages now, not only
in this life time.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:42.800
You have been saints in many lives and now
you are born here to seek it.

00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:45.660
It’s so simple as that.

00:23:45.660 --> 00:23:50.300
It has to happen, that’s your nature, that’s
what you are.

00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:57.030
You try anything else, you won’t be satisfied
‘till you have found out the Truth.

00:23:57.030 --> 00:23:58.840
But that time nobody would listen to me.

00:23:58.840 --> 00:24:06.440
It was a very funny situation and I ultimately
decided that let them find out for themselves

00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:07.920
to begin with.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:12.730
When they will find it out, they have to reach
the right conclusion.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:20.760
Because there is one problem in the seeking,
that you have to seek in your own freedom,

00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:26.480
in your own glory of your own choice.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:31.130
Because if you are to be liberated, it has
to be a free choice.

00:24:31.130 --> 00:24:36.880
If a person is not free, say, he is enticed
or he is hypnotised or he is overpowered by

00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:40.010
others, he has no freedom at all of any kind.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:43.840
Such a person is useless to enter into the
Kingdom of God.

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:52.040
If you have to become the King, then you have
to have that basic freedom in yourself intact.

00:24:52.040 --> 00:24:58.690
But freedom doesn’t mean ego by any chance.

00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:05.380
If you think: “I like it, I love it, I do
it,” that’s not the Spirit.

00:25:05.380 --> 00:25:08.450
You are not seekers of ego, I must tell you
very frankly, you are not.

00:25:08.450 --> 00:25:15.350
You are seekers of Truth, of Love, of Joy.

00:25:15.350 --> 00:25:17.390
For ages you’ve been seeking that.

00:25:17.390 --> 00:25:25.550
Joy is the result when you get to that position
where you become your Spirit, your Atma.

00:25:25.550 --> 00:25:30.700
You should be in Joy, not talking about it,
but enjoying it.

00:25:30.700 --> 00:25:33.570
And that has to happen to you.

00:25:33.570 --> 00:25:38.380
It’s a happening for which you have built
in for ages.

00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.973
Today, in general, I will tell you what you
are really and what you have to expect.

00:25:44.997 --> 00:25:47.222
To become what?

00:25:47.285 --> 00:25:48.980
Nobody has told you about it.

00:25:48.980 --> 00:25:53.200
They said, “All right, you’ll come to
us into a new age."

00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:55.220
“All right,” people said.

00:25:55.245 --> 00:25:59.509
“Let’s go and join!” Somebody says that
you’ll get this.

00:25:59.534 --> 00:26:01.263
You joined.

00:26:03.083 --> 00:26:10.140
William Blake is one of the greatest prophets
of the modern times.

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:18.178
For you Western people, he said that “The
men of God,” that means you people.

00:26:18.203 --> 00:26:19.922
You are people of God.

00:26:20.156 --> 00:26:22.510
You are not of this gross level.

00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.570
If people don’t understand you that does
not mean that I don’t understand.

00:26:26.570 --> 00:26:27.980
I know you, what you are.

00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.917
I know what it is, I can feel it.

00:26:34.214 --> 00:26:41.100
He said, “Men of God will become prophets,
and these prophets will have powers to make

00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:45.660
others prophets."

00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:54.915
This is what we have to expect within ourselves.

00:27:00.610 --> 00:27:10.021
So you have to become the prophet and you
have to make others prophet.

00:27:10.046 --> 00:27:18.200
Now this is the point you should judge: Have
you become the prophet?

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.495
What is a prophet?

00:27:21.520 --> 00:27:32.030
Prophet is a person who can feel the all-pervading
power around.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:35.244
Now I said there is all-pervading power of
Love.

00:27:35.269 --> 00:27:41.530
Oh you also sing the song, they say, “Yes,
there is all-pervading power."

00:27:41.530 --> 00:27:46.470
Many people also feel that they are feeling
it, but it’s not true.

00:27:46.470 --> 00:27:51.539
We have to be honest to ourselves because
we are seekers, we should not cheat ourselves

00:27:51.564 --> 00:27:57.201
because this is ego that makes you cheat.

00:27:57.226 --> 00:27:59.540
This intelligence is the worst thing.

00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:04.738
Gregoire himself told me one day, “I find
my intelligence is trying to cheat me."

00:28:04.763 --> 00:28:06.910
Very intelligently.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:15.754
So one has to be very careful to understand
that you have to become that.

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:19.418
You are the loser, you are the loser. Nobody else.

00:28:19.754 --> 00:28:27.520
If you play around with your ego, your superego,
your conditionings or mesmerism or hypnosis,

00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.015
and your ideas about having a kind of life,
you are the loser.

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:37.520
All that could be a great barrier to be the
Spirit, which is a different thing altogether,

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:41.320
is beyond this.

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:47.800
So when you become the Spirit, what happens
to you, what should you expect?

00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:55.491
Of course it’s true that this all-pervading
power is there.

00:28:56.225 --> 00:29:01.990
Now if I say there are lots of plays going on
here, there is a music going on here, you

00:29:01.990 --> 00:29:03.974
won’t believe.

00:29:04.050 --> 00:29:07.845
If I bring the television and say, “Now,
this is the one which is going to show you."

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:08.737
You will say, “Oh."

00:29:08.762 --> 00:29:09.878
I mean, you know it.

00:29:09.903 --> 00:29:13.446
But in India, if I take it to a village who
has never seen a television, they’ll say,

00:29:13.471 --> 00:29:14.460
“This box?

00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:20.480
How can it do it?” But you put it to the
mains and fantastic things can happen.

00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:23.260
It catches all that.

00:29:23.260 --> 00:29:32.360
In the same way, when you become that, when
you get a little breakthrough, it’s just

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.870
the plugging to the mains.

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:38.293
You are all ready for that.

00:29:38.318 --> 00:29:39.700
And the fantastic thing happens.

00:29:39.700 --> 00:29:43.580
First you start feeling it all around.

00:29:43.580 --> 00:29:47.300
Now don’t jump into ego.

00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:49.260
That’s not the end of it.

00:29:49.532 --> 00:29:53.402
You first start feeling it.

00:29:53.427 --> 00:30:02.777
Then you start understanding that your centres
are on your fingertips.

00:30:02.821 --> 00:30:07.438
It means that you are the master of that.

00:30:07.463 --> 00:30:10.678
And then you start feeling around

00:30:11.455 --> 00:30:13.455
and you know it is there

00:30:14.346 --> 00:30:18.395
Then I´m here jus to decode it, to tell you,
this is what this finger mean "this"

00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.580
You verify it.

00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:25.140
It is so much surprising when people verify
it.

00:30:25.140 --> 00:30:28.980
There was a gentleman in London.

00:30:28.980 --> 00:30:38.070
I had seven hippies in London and I worked
on them for four years, English people are

00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.950
a little difficult to crack.

00:30:39.950 --> 00:30:49.650
But after four years they really got their
realization in a proper way and after that

00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:55.730
now we have thousands of people who are realized
in England.

00:30:55.730 --> 00:31:01.130
Because once they find something, then they
get to it.

00:31:01.130 --> 00:31:04.300
They’re not the people who are shifty.

00:31:04.300 --> 00:31:09.190
Somehow they have that much wisdom, that balance
in them.

00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:16.490
They understand that if you have found a little
water in a place, then go on digging there

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.900
alone to have the well.

00:31:17.900 --> 00:31:22.180
They don’t leave that and go to another
place and dig well and dig well and dig well.

00:31:22.180 --> 00:31:26.110
They can know where to stop.

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:32.060
So these people were very skeptical in the
beginning.

00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:41.170
One of them got Realization and he said, “Mother,
it is all pervading, it has got telecommunication

00:31:41.170 --> 00:31:43.507
and everything.

00:31:43.550 --> 00:31:50.362
What about my Father who has not telephoned
to me and who always writes to me and has

00:31:50.387 --> 00:31:51.440
not written to me?

00:31:51.465 --> 00:31:53.254
He’s in Scotland."

00:31:53.254 --> 00:31:55.557
I said, “You trunk call him just now."

00:31:55.582 --> 00:31:57.192
I said, “You feel it.

00:31:57.614 --> 00:32:00.084
Just put your hands like that."

00:32:00.084 --> 00:32:02.944
And he said,”I am getting a burning here."

00:32:02.944 --> 00:32:08.634
I said:”That means he must be down with
very bad bronchitis.

00:32:08.634 --> 00:32:14.503
These are the centers of your father and this
is the finger which denotes this center.

00:32:14.528 --> 00:32:16.488
You telephone to him and find out."

00:32:16.513 --> 00:32:23.883
He telephoned to him and the mother said exactly
the same centers, that he’s down with very

00:32:23.908 --> 00:32:25.257
bad bronchitis.

00:32:25.585 --> 00:32:29.203
This could be a cock and bull story.

00:32:29.228 --> 00:32:40.374
The way Gregoire was telling you, he was trying
to establish my credibility to you, because

00:32:40.374 --> 00:32:44.934
it is such an apologetic condition in which
I have come.

00:32:44.934 --> 00:32:48.824
It‘s a very funny situation, I know that.

00:32:48.824 --> 00:32:54.004
The other day I went to see a very influential
Indian man.

00:32:54.004 --> 00:32:58.004
Of course, he knows me, because of my husband
maybe.

00:32:58.004 --> 00:33:04.694
He knows that a person of that status may
not come to this level of cheating others,

00:33:04.694 --> 00:33:05.694
whatever it is.

00:33:05.694 --> 00:33:16.084
But still he told me that he can’t understand
how people are taking to these horrible gurus

00:33:16.084 --> 00:33:22.404
and how these gurus came and cheated me also
and I helped them.

00:33:22.404 --> 00:33:35.524
In Sahaja Yoga, it’s a spontaneous happening,
a living happening.

00:33:35.524 --> 00:33:41.543
You are a living being and the force of God
is also living.

00:33:41.543 --> 00:33:54.279
Just like a fruit comes out of a flower, just
like this living process takes place, you

00:33:54.304 --> 00:33:56.404
become your Spirit.

00:33:57.154 --> 00:34:03.446
We never think this thing is around us, every
day we see.

00:34:03.471 --> 00:34:06.149
This is worked out by this all pervading Power.

00:34:06.174 --> 00:34:10.414
We can’t do even with one flower.

00:34:10.634 --> 00:34:14.846
We cannot transform even one flower into a
fruit.

00:34:14.871 --> 00:34:16.876
We take it for granted.

00:34:16.901 --> 00:34:20.109
We never know that all such living things
are done.

00:34:20.134 --> 00:34:21.334
Now look at it.

00:34:21.334 --> 00:34:25.134
There is a little bird, which lays the egg.

00:34:25.134 --> 00:34:26.204
For what?

00:34:26.204 --> 00:34:29.824
The eggs are kept in the nest.

00:34:29.824 --> 00:34:37.844
The all pervading Power works it out in such
a way that the eggs grow and the bird hatches

00:34:37.844 --> 00:34:44.594
them and from these eggs comes out a bird.

00:34:44.594 --> 00:34:48.444
We have seen caterpillars turning into butterflies.

00:34:48.444 --> 00:34:50.824
We never think how it happens.

00:34:50.824 --> 00:34:53.194
We just take it for granted.

00:34:53.194 --> 00:34:54.774
We enjoy their colors.

00:34:54.774 --> 00:35:02.514
We never see how this transformation has taken
place and this transmutation has taken place.

00:35:02.514 --> 00:35:09.444
In Sanskrit language a realized soul is called
as dwijaha, is the one who is born twice.

00:35:09.444 --> 00:35:11.574
Of course, this is also another problem.

00:35:11.574 --> 00:35:16.012
Last time I said you are to be born actually
again.

00:35:16.037 --> 00:35:17.587
It is a living process.

00:35:17.612 --> 00:35:24.774
The Kundalini has to move throughout the centers
and you have to feel the actualization of

00:35:24.774 --> 00:35:29.954
your Realization, meaning that you must feel
the cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle

00:35:29.954 --> 00:35:31.334
bone area.

00:35:31.334 --> 00:35:33.244
Realization you have to feel.

00:35:33.244 --> 00:35:38.194
It’s an actualization, not a vague belief,
I told them hundred times.

00:35:38.194 --> 00:35:41.194
And they were taping me.

00:35:41.194 --> 00:35:43.624
Some people told me, ”Mother, don’t allow
them to tape."

00:35:43.624 --> 00:35:46.204
I said, “Let them tape! What’s the matter?

00:35:46.204 --> 00:35:48.144
I am not running any enterprise."

00:35:48.144 --> 00:35:53.694
They said, “No, they will use it for some
purpose."

00:35:53.694 --> 00:35:55.074
I said, “Let them use it.

00:35:55.074 --> 00:35:57.764
For what purpose they are going to use I don’t
understand."

00:35:57.764 --> 00:35:59.734
I don’t understand these human laws.

00:35:59.734 --> 00:36:02.114
I am very bad at it.

00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:05.944
And human beings I am also worse.

00:36:05.944 --> 00:36:11.494
These people met me the other day in Sydney
after so many years.

00:36:11.494 --> 00:36:14.699
They have branded themselves as born again.

00:36:14.724 --> 00:36:19.864
And they just self-certificated that we are
born again.

00:36:19.864 --> 00:36:21.874
I said, ”But how?”

00:36:21.874 --> 00:36:24.384
“But we are born again."

00:36:24.384 --> 00:36:30.044
“But what is the proof that you are born
again, my children?

00:36:30.044 --> 00:36:31.754
How do you believe you are born again?

00:36:31.754 --> 00:36:34.284
There must be some proof of it.

00:36:34.284 --> 00:36:35.374
“Oh, we are born again.

00:36:35.374 --> 00:36:36.374
Finished."

00:36:36.374 --> 00:36:39.394
Now, you cannot self-certify yourself.

00:36:39.394 --> 00:36:42.674
If you do that, it is Ego.

00:36:42.674 --> 00:36:43.814
Understand that.

00:36:43.814 --> 00:36:51.544
If you are born again, you should be able
to feel the centers of other people, you should

00:36:51.544 --> 00:36:59.224
be able to feel your own centers, you should
be able to judge yourself and cure yourself

00:36:59.224 --> 00:37:01.054
and you could cure others.

00:37:01.054 --> 00:37:06.694
Not only that, but you can raise their Kundalini
and give them Realization.

00:37:06.694 --> 00:37:14.034
This is the minimum of minimums to them.

00:37:14.034 --> 00:37:17.924
I mean an egg, if it is chanting, “I am
a bird,” does it become?

00:37:17.924 --> 00:37:20.796
It’s an egg and an egg is an egg.

00:37:20.821 --> 00:37:22.569
If it says, “Oh, I am
a bird."

00:37:22.594 --> 00:37:24.323
It can’t fly.

00:37:26.096 --> 00:37:29.046
It has to really fly.

00:37:29.078 --> 00:37:30.949
If you tell the egg:

00:37:31.037 --> 00:37:34.942
"Mrs egg, would you please fly?"

00:37:35.822 --> 00:37:39.234
Some of the nursery rhymes are Humpty Dumpty
sat on the wall.

00:37:39.234 --> 00:37:41.744
That’s what they are.

00:37:41.744 --> 00:37:44.604
They believe that they are great people.

00:37:44.604 --> 00:37:50.614
They sat on the wall and when they fell down,
all the King’s horses and all the King’s

00:37:50.614 --> 00:37:53.446
men could not put them together again.

00:37:53.470 --> 00:37:55.138
This is what it is,

00:37:55.139 --> 00:37:58.854
this is a make believe, that we are born again.

00:37:58.854 --> 00:38:02.954
But it’s of no use to you.

00:38:02.954 --> 00:38:04.714
You are Seekers.

00:38:04.714 --> 00:38:07.954
You are nothing but Seekers of Spirit.

00:38:07.954 --> 00:38:10.874
Accept that situation, first of all.

00:38:10.874 --> 00:38:12.664
Accept your Self.

00:38:12.664 --> 00:38:18.795
These false certificates are not going to
help you, by any chance.

00:38:18.820 --> 00:38:24.484
Again I go away, you find another Guru, get
after him, get after another, get after another

00:38:24.484 --> 00:38:25.484
one.

00:38:25.484 --> 00:38:27.714
Some of them just end up into a lunatic Asylum.

00:38:27.714 --> 00:38:31.484
I don’t know what to do with them.

00:38:31.484 --> 00:38:38.674
When this happens to you, physically you feel
all right.

00:38:38.674 --> 00:38:42.114
I mean cancers can only be cured through your
Kundalini awakening.

00:38:42.114 --> 00:38:45.044
I’ve been saying this for the last ten years.

00:38:45.044 --> 00:38:49.364
I’ve also cured cancer automatically of
people as a by product.

00:38:49.364 --> 00:38:54.114
All diseases get cured.-That is the minimum
of minimum that should happen to you.

00:38:54.114 --> 00:39:00.674
After all, Realization is not some sort of
a cheap thing you can buy in the market like

00:39:00.674 --> 00:39:03.964
a take away food.

00:39:03.964 --> 00:39:11.164
It is your Spirit, which is an eternal Being,
which you achieve.

00:39:11.164 --> 00:39:12.594
You achieve your absolute value.

00:39:12.594 --> 00:39:18.634
You become that though it happens so spontaneously,
so easily that you can’t believe.

00:39:18.659 --> 00:39:20.244
You have no self esteem.

00:39:20.269 --> 00:39:23.290
You can’t believe it that you have really
got it in the beginning.

00:39:23.315 --> 00:39:25.335
People just don’t believe it.

00:39:25.994 --> 00:39:29.040
It is impossible, they can believe it
that this has happened.

00:39:29.073 --> 00:39:33.200
And when they don’t believe it, they don’t
want to practice it any further.

00:39:33.225 --> 00:39:35.169
It’s so surprising.

00:39:37.928 --> 00:39:45.067
First you have to get the sprouting of Kundalini
and then you have to allow it to grow and

00:39:45.092 --> 00:39:51.022
once you grow into it, then you are like a
tree.

00:39:51.047 --> 00:39:53.295
As Gregoire says it’s true.

00:39:53.320 --> 00:40:02.840
He was here in Santa Cruz, went to Berkeley,
there he met a very good Sahaja Yogi from

00:40:02.865 --> 00:40:06.655
India and just came down to London.

00:40:06.708 --> 00:40:09.488
That time I saw him and I said, “Look at
this Seeker coming down."

00:40:09.488 --> 00:40:16.248
I went to receive him at the station and I
was surprised – he was so frantic, he was

00:40:16.248 --> 00:40:21.858
so upset and I was surprised that the centers…
I know what he was.

00:40:21.858 --> 00:40:23.638
He is a Seeker, I know that.

00:40:23.638 --> 00:40:27.218
That had such love, and such feeling.

00:40:27.218 --> 00:40:28.758
I said, “ Look at this my child.

00:40:28.758 --> 00:40:29.758
Where is he lost?

00:40:29.758 --> 00:40:34.058
What has happened to you?”

00:40:34.058 --> 00:40:39.458
Now, we have to know what we are, what we
have to achieve and where we are to go.

00:40:39.458 --> 00:40:40.458
That’s an important thing.

00:40:40.458 --> 00:40:45.069
As I have told you, you must know what you
have to achieve, what you get.

00:40:45.093 --> 00:40:46.563
In a very gross way I’ve told you.

00:40:46.563 --> 00:40:54.709
Actually, it’s so dynamic, it is so fantastic
that if I tell you any more stories of it,

00:40:54.803 --> 00:40:58.638
you’d say it’s really a cock and bull
story.

00:40:58.663 --> 00:41:00.253
But there is God.

00:41:00.253 --> 00:41:08.633
He’s there, no doubt and He is dynamic and
He is all powerful and that He is all Love

00:41:08.633 --> 00:41:13.413
and that He loves you so much that he wants
you to enjoy His Kingdom.

00:41:13.413 --> 00:41:16.053
It’s true, no doubt about it.

00:41:16.053 --> 00:41:21.113
I am here to prove everything to you, not
to talk and give sermons and all that, but

00:41:21.113 --> 00:41:24.243
to prove it to you.

00:41:24.243 --> 00:41:35.286
And his Powers are so fantastic, at every
level how they work out is amazing.

00:41:35.311 --> 00:41:38.313
You have to just become.

00:41:38.313 --> 00:41:40.073
Becoming is the main thing.

00:41:40.073 --> 00:41:47.453
Now, as far as I am concerned, I am Your Mother.

00:41:47.453 --> 00:41:52.583
You have every right on me.

00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:57.163
I shouldn’t say I am your guru because I
am only here to connect you to your Self and

00:41:57.188 --> 00:42:01.209
you become your own guru, you
don't need any Guru anymore.

00:42:01.247 --> 00:42:04.703
Once you are connected to the mains you become
your own guru.

00:42:04.703 --> 00:42:07.083
You know this Warren Reeves, Dr.

00:42:07.083 --> 00:42:08.083
Warren Reeves.

00:42:08.083 --> 00:42:16.203
He came to me and I had to stick on to him
because he was all the time running away.

00:42:16.203 --> 00:42:22.083
He has been to so many gurus who pampered
his ego –-”Oh, you are a great seeker,”

00:42:22.083 --> 00:42:24.383
“You are already a realized soul."

00:42:24.383 --> 00:42:31.463
All these things are sticking onto his head
and it was very difficult to get him together.

00:42:31.463 --> 00:42:34.243
And also I do not work in the city.

00:42:34.243 --> 00:42:38.873
I actually work in the villages of India where
really thousands of people have got realization.

00:42:38.873 --> 00:42:42.893
We have seen six thousand people get their
Self realization at a time.

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:51.543
But Indians are wise people and they are the
people who do not indulge into extremes.

00:42:51.543 --> 00:42:55.443
In their seeking also they are wise and they
know what to expect.

00:42:55.443 --> 00:42:58.703
So, it’s easy for me to work out.

00:42:58.703 --> 00:43:06.069
They are innocent people still not exposed
to the material things that you have.

00:43:06.115 --> 00:43:08.297
Though you’ve denied it, but you can’t
help it.

00:43:08.322 --> 00:43:09.622
Your brain is modern.

00:43:09.662 --> 00:43:11.992
You may try to look like primitive people.

00:43:11.992 --> 00:43:13.012
The brain is modern.

00:43:13.012 --> 00:43:14.152
What can you do?

00:43:14.152 --> 00:43:16.372
Think, think, think, think, think.

00:43:16.372 --> 00:43:20.542
Just by changing your brain, you do not become
that.

00:43:20.575 --> 00:43:22.519
This is the point we should know.

00:43:22.543 --> 00:43:27.964
So, it’s easy there to work it out and in
the Indian villages you don’t even get sometimes

00:43:28.238 --> 00:43:29.748
a car to move out.

00:43:29.748 --> 00:43:35.512
You have to go in a bullock cart and there
is no bathroom, you have to go to the river.

00:43:35.537 --> 00:43:39.335
It’s all right for a change or holiday,
but when you have to be with me three months

00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.037
like that, it was too much for him.

00:43:41.208 --> 00:43:47.664
But still he managed and now you will be amazed,
he has established seven centers in seven

00:43:47.689 --> 00:43:49.739
cities in Australia.

00:43:50.536 --> 00:43:56.497
If you ask him how many people he has given
realization, he will say, “I don’t remember."

00:43:56.522 --> 00:44:00.604
So, one light which has been enlightened,
can enlighten another light.

00:44:00.629 --> 00:44:04.567
But the first light has to be an enlightened
light.

00:44:04.592 --> 00:44:09.741
Once you say that you are enlightened, everybody’s
ego starts coming up.

00:44:09.766 --> 00:44:12.856
It’s very common with the Western people.

00:44:12.881 --> 00:44:17.574
Every time I went to some place they said,
“Why you of all the things, Mother?”

00:44:17.599 --> 00:44:19.113
I said, “It’s all right.

00:44:19.138 --> 00:44:21.448
You come along, It’s a good idea.

00:44:21.473 --> 00:44:23.163
I would like to retire."

00:44:23.188 --> 00:44:26.868
I said, “My husband would pay a man who
can do my job.

00:44:26.893 --> 00:44:34.173
It’s a thankless job to work for days and
nights together and he will be very happy

00:44:34.213 --> 00:44:37.115
to do that for you."

00:44:54.874 --> 00:45:04.024
This problem of becoming is not yours, is
mine for the time being.

00:45:04.415 --> 00:45:07.357
When you become that, then it is yours.

00:45:07.382 --> 00:45:11.560
Once I know how to swim I can save you.

00:45:11.585 --> 00:45:16.335
If I do not know how to swim how can I make
you swim?

00:45:16.335 --> 00:45:19.855
When you learn how to swim you can also save
other people.

00:45:19.855 --> 00:45:20.855
It’s very simple.

00:45:20.855 --> 00:45:24.715
But even if you say it is saving, people get
frightened.

00:45:24.715 --> 00:45:27.665
No, it’s becoming.

00:45:27.665 --> 00:45:29.575
It’s what you are.

00:45:29.575 --> 00:45:32.495
To get to that is the point.

00:45:32.495 --> 00:45:40.365
I would like to tell you what we are and what
is going to happen to us when we become realized

00:45:40.365 --> 00:45:41.365
souls.

00:45:41.365 --> 00:45:44.135
It’s a gross manifestation of the powers
I told you.

00:45:44.135 --> 00:45:50.206
When you became human beings you got your
awareness in a different way than the animals

00:45:50.231 --> 00:45:53.175
have, because for the animals, for example,
they do not understand the beauty of this

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.089
room.

00:45:54.114 --> 00:45:55.114
They won’t.

00:45:55.139 --> 00:46:00.263
They don’t understand anything that is filthy
or dirty, they have no smell power.

00:46:00.288 --> 00:46:01.731
Somehow they’ve managed.

00:46:01.802 --> 00:46:06.098
They can live under any circumstances without
smelling anything.

00:46:06.123 --> 00:46:10.698
We don’t have to learn anything from animals.

00:46:10.698 --> 00:46:17.848
We are on top of all the creation and we have
to assume our position.

00:46:17.848 --> 00:46:25.101
Once you have assumed your position, you become
that and once you become that, then you will

00:46:25.126 --> 00:46:27.781
be surprised to see how fantastic you are.

00:46:27.806 --> 00:46:30.366
That is the discovery you have to have.

00:46:31.215 --> 00:46:36.965
Within ourselves I think all of you got this
unique discovery so it’s easy for you to

00:46:36.965 --> 00:46:39.025
see what I’m about to say.

00:46:39.025 --> 00:46:44.465
You will be amazed this lecture which I gave
about ten years back in India to begin with

00:46:44.465 --> 00:46:46.249
after there have been many lectures.

00:46:46.274 --> 00:46:48.190
But if you have this is a good idea.

00:46:48.215 --> 00:46:49.909
You can go home and see for yourself.

00:46:49.934 --> 00:46:52.021
But you also have a little pamphlet.

00:46:54.281 --> 00:46:59.660
On the back side is the complete picture of
the Kundalini.

00:47:10.958 --> 00:47:24.525
Now, this is the God, the Primordial Being,
who has made you in His own image.

00:47:24.525 --> 00:47:29.985
But still there’s the reflector, the human
being, which is not complete.

00:47:29.985 --> 00:47:41.515
Within us lies this subtle mechanism, which
is called the tantra.

00:47:41.515 --> 00:47:50.565
This is the real tantra, holy tantra, is an
auspicious thing, which gives us righteousness.

00:47:50.565 --> 00:47:53.947
You see, when we think of the tantrikas, they
are the worst of all.

00:47:53.971 --> 00:47:55.696
They make money,

00:47:55.697 --> 00:48:00.323
they do all kinds of violence, they teach
all kinds of nonsensical things.

00:48:00.348 --> 00:48:04.235
I mean they indulge into any kind of sex.

00:48:04.235 --> 00:48:07.326
They use your women, they use your money,
they do all kinds of things.

00:48:07.351 --> 00:48:20.805
This is the holy mechanism, this is the pure
mechanism, is the purity, is completely pure

00:48:20.805 --> 00:48:24.187
Love, is not biased.

00:48:24.212 --> 00:48:33.722
This mechanism exists within you and expresses
itself outside in the gross also to a great

00:48:33.750 --> 00:48:35.683
extent.

00:48:35.975 --> 00:48:55.621
It expresses itself, on the left-hand side,
as the power of your Desire (iccha shakti).

00:48:55.646 --> 00:49:03.635
This expresses itself within us as our emotions,
as our psyche.

00:49:03.635 --> 00:49:08.675
Gregoire has rightly said that Freud was quite
half-baked because he knew only one part of

00:49:08.675 --> 00:49:11.998
the human being and that, too, was very little
of the psyche.

00:49:12.023 --> 00:49:15.716
Because all the scientists see things from
outside in.

00:49:15.741 --> 00:49:20.940
If you see a tree from outside, if there is
something wrong with the leaf, you try to

00:49:20.965 --> 00:49:22.206
treat the leaf.

00:49:22.231 --> 00:49:26.433
But how to treat the whole tree is through
the roots.

00:49:26.511 --> 00:49:35.315
So you go to the roots of your being and these
are the roots.

00:49:35.315 --> 00:49:44.105
One side of it is the Power of Desire and
it works out after the first center.

00:49:44.105 --> 00:49:48.747
I’ll be telling you tomorrow morning about
these centers.

00:49:48.787 --> 00:49:55.982
The another power is the power of action,
which enacts your Desire

00:49:56.006 --> 00:49:58.006
whick works out your desire.

00:49:58.555 --> 00:50:00.785
this yellow color.

00:50:00.785 --> 00:50:05.071
This gives you your future.

00:50:05.157 --> 00:50:10.660
You enter into your future by your planning,
by your thinking, for working out.

00:50:10.685 --> 00:50:14.574
The left side gives you your past.

00:50:14.765 --> 00:50:23.105
It goes on accumulating on the left-hand side
and the deeper you move on the left-hand side

00:50:23.105 --> 00:50:25.385
there is the collective subconscious.

00:50:25.385 --> 00:50:29.185
First the subconscious and then the collective
subconscious.

00:50:29.185 --> 00:50:37.433
Now this is very important to know that when
we indulge too much into the left subconscious,

00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:44.495
that is a very dangerous situation, as well
as if you move into your right-hand side is

00:50:44.495 --> 00:50:52.645
the supra conscious and then to the collective
supraconscious, is also a very dangerous situation.

00:50:52.645 --> 00:51:00.085
Moving into the left and the right is the
easy thing for human beings to do because

00:51:00.085 --> 00:51:07.945
if you want to do something, if you try to
do something about it and if you are not spontaneous,

00:51:07.945 --> 00:51:09.920
what happens?

00:51:09.945 --> 00:51:17.665
That your sympathetic nervous system, which is
governed by this subtle energy, goes into

00:51:17.665 --> 00:51:22.765
action and you either move into the left side
or into the right side.

00:51:22.765 --> 00:51:29.775
For example, if you want to run, as these
days many people are just running, (You can

00:51:29.775 --> 00:51:32.672
run once in a while, but all the time running
– what is the need?

00:51:32.697 --> 00:51:35.135
Human beings are delicate things.

00:51:35.135 --> 00:51:41.715
The way we go headlong into everything like
a bull in a china shop is not necessary.

00:51:41.715 --> 00:51:46.705
The way you ruin yourself also, because you
think this body is your own, do what you like.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.335
You must respect your body.

00:51:49.335 --> 00:51:56.235
This is the Temple of God.) So, when you start
overdoing something on the left or the right

00:51:56.235 --> 00:52:01.795
side, say some people are crying, weeping,
singing praise of death and all that, so have

00:52:01.795 --> 00:52:02.795
it.

00:52:02.795 --> 00:52:05.015
Some people say we must suffer.

00:52:05.015 --> 00:52:08.135
Alright, then you suffer, have Hitler on top
of your head.

00:52:08.135 --> 00:52:12.697
If you want more, you can have them, any number.

00:52:12.725 --> 00:52:15.610
There are already so many coming to make you
suffer.

00:52:15.635 --> 00:52:17.784
There is no need for you to suffer.

00:52:17.824 --> 00:52:20.565
Somebody has suffered for you, once and for
all.

00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:24.469
There is no need for you to suffer anymore.

00:52:24.696 --> 00:52:28.635
You are just ready to enter into the Kingdom
of God.

00:52:28.660 --> 00:52:35.495
If you try to go too much on the left-hand
side or too much on the right-hand side, you

00:52:35.495 --> 00:52:38.342
feel that you have gone into a new world.

00:52:38.367 --> 00:52:39.827
You have not.

00:52:40.530 --> 00:52:44.195
For example, take a simple thing like LSD.

00:52:44.219 --> 00:52:46.510
Now, what happens when you take LSD?

00:52:48.482 --> 00:52:50.960
When you take LSD, you move to the right side.

00:52:50.984 --> 00:52:52.975
You start seeing the light,

00:52:52.976 --> 00:52:55.654
you start seeing the eyes and all that.

00:52:55.678 --> 00:52:57.678
Is a movement of the right-hand side.

00:52:57.716 --> 00:53:03.380
Actually, you put your Ego to the right-hand
side and you start seeing that and once you

00:53:03.405 --> 00:53:07.395
see that you do not become anything, you just
see it.

00:53:07.395 --> 00:53:10.792
Seeing it is not becoming, you have to become.

00:53:10.824 --> 00:53:15.075
And once you start seeing it, you think you
have become a higher personality.

00:53:15.075 --> 00:53:16.075
It’s absolutely wrong.

00:53:16.075 --> 00:53:21.709
You are under the control of something else.

00:53:21.734 --> 00:53:24.534
You are not yourself.

00:53:27.469 --> 00:53:35.460
The last word on the collective supraconscious
was Hitler.

00:53:35.485 --> 00:53:38.211
He got lost completely.

00:53:38.236 --> 00:53:49.899
He was using tantrikas, these horrible people,
and he was using all that knowledge, so called,

00:53:49.924 --> 00:53:51.841
how to use these forces.

00:53:51.925 --> 00:53:58.915
The forces come to you through dead spirits
who are very powerful in their lifetime, and

00:53:58.915 --> 00:54:06.893
those who are not, give up that idea of domination
and they are on this earth still all around.

00:54:06.918 --> 00:54:12.255
The left-sided people are the people who indulge
into other kind of things like-alcohols and

00:54:12.255 --> 00:54:20.239
ganjas and all these things, by which you
become sort of all the time crying, weeping,

00:54:20.264 --> 00:54:21.598
this, that.

00:54:21.989 --> 00:54:25.525
In that you see your past.

00:54:25.525 --> 00:54:30.255
Is a good idea in a way, but a bad idea also
in a way, because you are in the present,

00:54:30.280 --> 00:54:31.489
not in your past.

00:54:31.514 --> 00:54:36.097
Past does not exist any more, it’s finished
now.

00:54:36.339 --> 00:54:38.797
What exists is the present.

00:54:38.822 --> 00:54:44.615
Either you are in the future or in the past
and when you go too much into it you get identified

00:54:44.615 --> 00:54:47.905
and you think this is what is the Truth, which
is not.

00:54:47.905 --> 00:54:51.391
I have to tell you that it is not.

00:54:51.416 --> 00:54:53.828
What is the Truth is your Spirit.

00:54:53.890 --> 00:55:03.842
That it is your evolutionary process has to, little bit
trigger it and that’s how you become.

00:55:03.867 --> 00:55:05.904
By becoming that what happens to you?

00:55:05.929 --> 00:55:07.903
You don’t start jumping like mad.

00:55:07.928 --> 00:55:08.755
No, it’s not.

00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:09.780
Anybody can jump.

00:55:09.805 --> 00:55:12.219
Is it difficult to jump?

00:55:12.467 --> 00:55:15.297
Some people who said that we went for a flying
course.

00:55:15.531 --> 00:55:18.519
They paid 3000 Pounds to fly.

00:55:18.544 --> 00:55:19.769
What is the need?

00:55:19.794 --> 00:55:23.324
You don’t want to become birds or frogs,
do you?

00:55:23.715 --> 00:55:27.265
And they were nothing but frogs jumping.

00:55:27.265 --> 00:55:28.895
In my presence they were jumping like that.

00:55:28.895 --> 00:55:31.255
I didn’t know how to control.

00:55:33.200 --> 00:55:36.677
And they paid 3000 pounds for this.

00:55:36.702 --> 00:55:41.225
The other day in a plane I had somebody from
that kind of a thing was sitting and he was

00:55:41.225 --> 00:55:43.245
all the time doing like this because I was
sitting behind him.

00:55:43.270 --> 00:55:46.559
I said, ”I think I better get out from there
and go out the back."

00:55:46.950 --> 00:55:49.195
You are not in your own control.

00:55:49.195 --> 00:55:51.095
You have to be your own master.

00:55:51.095 --> 00:55:57.209
Now you must know this, that you should be
able to control yourself is the main point.

00:55:57.234 --> 00:56:00.795
Like in a car, there are these two powers.

00:56:00.795 --> 00:56:07.675
One is the brake and the other is the accelerator.

00:56:07.675 --> 00:56:10.905
First, you don’t know how to drive.

00:56:10.905 --> 00:56:16.435
You are sitting and first you are going into
a ditch, then sometimes you are getting out

00:56:16.435 --> 00:56:20.315
trying to balance it, then you know how to
drive.

00:56:20.315 --> 00:56:21.466
When do you know?

00:56:21.491 --> 00:56:23.013
When you know.

00:56:23.525 --> 00:56:27.685
If you ask me, “Mother, when do we know
how to drive?” When we know.

00:56:27.685 --> 00:56:29.675
It is an amazingly simple thing.

00:56:29.675 --> 00:56:32.175
So, now you have managed both these.

00:56:32.175 --> 00:56:36.315
First, you’ve made accident and have done
all mistakes, doesn’t matter.

00:56:36.315 --> 00:56:39.795
As long as you learn how to drive, finished.

00:56:39.795 --> 00:56:45.993
First you have a driving license, then you
start arranging these two things to keep yourself

00:56:46.018 --> 00:56:47.103
into balance.

00:56:47.873 --> 00:56:54.735
You come into balance, still you are not the
master of the car, but you are master as far

00:56:54.735 --> 00:56:56.735
as the mechanism is concerned.

00:56:56.735 --> 00:57:02.244
So, there is a master who is sitting, of the
car and of you.

00:57:02.269 --> 00:57:08.457
In the beginning you should be master of your
body, master of everything.

00:57:08.543 --> 00:57:13.677
Then, what happens, that you become the master
of the car as well.

00:57:13.702 --> 00:57:21.462
First you balance yourself in such a way that
you know how to master your body, your mind

00:57:21.487 --> 00:57:22.305
and everything.

00:57:22.974 --> 00:57:27.695
And then you become that by which you can
master other people also.

00:57:27.785 --> 00:57:29.885
But mastery does not mean domination.

00:57:29.910 --> 00:57:31.025
It’s Love.

00:57:31.157 --> 00:57:35.437
It’s a wrong idea that a master is a person
who dominates.

00:57:36.305 --> 00:57:38.485
It comes from where I don’t know.

00:57:38.485 --> 00:57:41.255
Master is the one who loves, who really does.

00:57:41.255 --> 00:57:46.346
He may just sometimes tell you don’t do
this because it’s wrong, the whole bad things

00:57:46.371 --> 00:57:47.979
happening, he may tell you.

00:57:48.137 --> 00:57:51.187
But he is a comforter.

00:57:51.547 --> 00:57:56.839
Comforter, because you have felt no Love in
your life.

00:57:56.910 --> 00:58:00.095
The real Love you have not felt.

00:58:00.095 --> 00:58:02.275
You want some place where you can get that
Love.

00:58:02.275 --> 00:58:05.565
He is a comforter, is the left side.

00:58:05.565 --> 00:58:11.225
In our Sahaja Yoga language we call the Comforter
as Mahakali.

00:58:11.225 --> 00:58:13.538
She is the Holy Ghost.

00:58:13.563 --> 00:58:17.901
From that Comforter other aspects come up.

00:58:17.926 --> 00:58:28.355
The second aspect is what you call the Councelor,
The one who tells you what is what, decodes

00:58:28.355 --> 00:58:31.655
everything, tells you how to manage, how to
go ahead.

00:58:31.655 --> 00:58:35.875
Like an instructor and you verify that.

00:58:35.875 --> 00:58:44.916
The second one in our Sahaja Yoga is called
Mahasaraswati

00:58:44.948 --> 00:58:50.556
And the third one is the Redeemer,the one
who gives you moksha,

00:58:51.213 --> 00:58:57.378
through the Sushumna nadi, is called as Mahalaxmi.

00:58:58.050 --> 00:59:01.808
These are the three powers which exist within
us.

00:59:01.833 --> 00:59:10.525
The first manifests the left sympathetic,
the second one manifests the right sympathetic

00:59:10.550 --> 00:59:21.155
and the third one gives you the parasympathetic
which controls these two centers, which coordinates,

00:59:21.155 --> 00:59:23.585
cooperates and refills.

00:59:23.585 --> 00:59:28.332
But it is still a limited amount of energy.

00:59:28.357 --> 00:59:32.325
Some people tell me that they went to a person
and felt the energy.

00:59:32.325 --> 00:59:34.525
What sort of an energy were you feeling?

00:59:34.550 --> 00:59:37.605
Very much like shaking and all that.

00:59:37.605 --> 00:59:39.325
No, that’s not good.

00:59:39.325 --> 00:59:43.621
If you are not possessed you should not shake
before a person.

00:59:43.646 --> 00:59:53.185
On the contrary you start feeling the cool
breeze in the hands.You feel completely relaxed.

00:59:53.296 --> 00:59:55.066
How do you know?

00:59:55.115 --> 00:59:59.495
What happens through Sahaja Yoga is the way,
is very good.

00:59:59.495 --> 01:00:01.145
You should see for yourself.

01:00:01.145 --> 01:00:12.355
Get three people – one from a lunatic asylum,
certified mad; get another one who is not

01:00:12.355 --> 01:00:16.989
realized; get the third one who is realized.

01:00:17.136 --> 01:00:18.346
They sit down.

01:00:18.371 --> 01:00:23.365
Now you ask them to put their hands towards
you.

01:00:23.365 --> 01:00:28.455
Now the person who is lunatic will be doing
like this.

01:00:28.455 --> 01:00:35.378
Now if there a cancer patient, he will be
emitting tremendous heat, so much so that

01:00:35.403 --> 01:00:39.759
you don’t need a heater, even in London
in December or January.

01:00:39.784 --> 01:00:42.994
If there is somebody like that, you
don't need anything.

01:00:44.720 --> 01:00:51.735
But supposing that person is just a normal,
balanced person, is in the center.

01:00:51.735 --> 01:00:58.255
He starts feeling the cool breeze and the
realized soul starts feeling the whole thing

01:00:58.255 --> 01:00:59.815
coming on.

01:00:59.815 --> 01:01:06.746
This is what you have to judge with people
when they come.

01:01:06.771 --> 01:01:10.072
You should know what happens to them.

01:01:10.097 --> 01:01:18.375
If you are seeking reality, you must know
that you have to face yourself as you are

01:01:18.375 --> 01:01:19.375
today.

01:01:19.375 --> 01:01:27.715
You need not try to hide anything, because
there is nothing to be hidden from your mother.

01:01:27.715 --> 01:01:29.185
I don’t care whatever you have done.

01:01:29.185 --> 01:01:30.995
I just don’t bother.

01:01:30.995 --> 01:01:32.545
It’s not necessary.

01:01:32.545 --> 01:01:38.191
The first mantra in Sahaja Yoga to be said
is that Mother, I am not guilty.

01:01:38.216 --> 01:01:41.235
You have to say that 16 times in your heart,

01:01:41.259 --> 01:01:43.655
that Mother, I´m not guilty

01:01:43.977 --> 01:01:54.345
This is the first mantra of Sahaja Yoga, because
in yourself whole things have crawled up into

01:01:54.345 --> 01:01:56.494
a diffidence in life.

01:01:57.878 --> 01:02:01.085
Even the Ego sometimes gets hurt.

01:02:01.110 --> 01:02:07.263
When you do mistakes or anything, it gets
hurt and when it gets hurt you get diffident,

01:02:07.288 --> 01:02:10.018
so it gets built up within you as diffident.

01:02:10.018 --> 01:02:15.868
When you say, “Mother, I am not guilty,”
your self-esteem is established.

01:02:15.868 --> 01:02:21.645
First day you’d better establish your self-esteem.

01:02:21.670 --> 01:02:29.012
Within you lies this power of Kundalini.

01:02:29.037 --> 01:02:33.847
I was very happy to know that people have
reached the conclusion that it is the Kundalini

01:02:33.872 --> 01:02:38.014
awakening which is going to do the job.

01:02:38.039 --> 01:02:40.412
It is a very good conclusion you have reached.

01:02:40.437 --> 01:02:46.717
But any Dick, Tom and Harry cannot do it,
one should know that.

01:02:48.003 --> 01:02:50.889
Saying it is a sprouting, it’s a living
process.

01:02:50.914 --> 01:02:53.730
Now, logically you should approach the subject.

01:02:53.755 --> 01:02:56.414
You are all very intelligent people, I can
see that.

01:02:56.438 --> 01:02:58.770
You are not stupid people.

01:02:59.150 --> 01:03:02.560
Living things, like sprouting the seed.

01:03:02.585 --> 01:03:06.669
If you want to sprout a seed, can you pull
it out?

01:03:07.177 --> 01:03:12.719
Or if you stand on your head, will it happen?

01:03:12.744 --> 01:03:15.614
They are such sweet things.

01:03:17.268 --> 01:03:18.283
“Hello.

01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:29.019
Alright now, sit down for a while."

01:03:29.044 --> 01:03:30.308
They are realized souls.

01:03:30.333 --> 01:03:31.526
They are born realized.

01:03:31.621 --> 01:03:35.591
So many children are born realized and if
you are not realized [UNCLEAR parents] you

01:03:35.591 --> 01:03:39.495
are going to harm them.

01:03:40.583 --> 01:03:44.984
You have to know what are they.

01:03:45.009 --> 01:03:50.818
They know me better than you people do and
they are going to come up.

01:03:50.843 --> 01:03:53.373
Wait for ten years before.

01:03:53.373 --> 01:04:00.775
They are going to create that great, beautiful
mansion of Love for you.

01:04:00.800 --> 01:04:07.855
So, this Kundalini is the power within us.

01:04:07.949 --> 01:04:10.118
What power is this?

01:04:10.143 --> 01:04:22.613
This is the power of Primordial Desire within
us to be one with the Divine, to be united

01:04:22.613 --> 01:04:25.404
with the Divine and this is the Yoga.

01:04:25.429 --> 01:04:27.203
All the rest of it is not.

01:04:27.203 --> 01:04:31.489
Yoga is nothing, that as you are,

01:04:31.513 --> 01:04:36.067
you are to be connected with the
Divine, is the Yoga.

01:04:36.091 --> 01:04:38.091
All right?

01:04:38.226 --> 01:04:41.266
If that is so, this desire is not yet manifested.

01:04:41.291 --> 01:04:47.153
So, it is called as a sleeping Kundalini and
only the person who has that warmth of the

01:04:47.153 --> 01:04:52.673
Mother Earth can do it, as simple as that.

01:04:52.673 --> 01:05:03.563
Everyone who thinks that Kundalini is to be
awakened must know it is a spontaneous, living

01:05:03.563 --> 01:05:07.290
happening, just like a sprouting of a seed.

01:05:07.315 --> 01:05:10.083
You cannot just pull it out.

01:05:10.083 --> 01:05:13.083
It cannot be done by any effort.

01:05:13.083 --> 01:05:15.253
It’s spontaneous.

01:05:15.253 --> 01:05:21.268
If it is evolutionary, logically we can find
out that we did nothing to become human beings

01:05:21.293 --> 01:05:22.399
from amoeba stage.

01:05:22.424 --> 01:05:28.923
We didn’t cut our tails to become human
beings, did we?

01:05:30.032 --> 01:05:31.992
We didn’t do anything.

01:05:32.017 --> 01:05:33.772
It has happened so spontaneously.

01:05:33.797 --> 01:05:38.026
But where is the change in us, let’s see
again logically.

01:05:38.051 --> 01:05:40.602
Not rationally, but logically.

01:05:40.627 --> 01:05:42.431
Rationality could be quite mad.

01:05:43.103 --> 01:05:53.043
Logically you should understand, what is the
difference we have got is in our awareness.

01:05:53.043 --> 01:05:58.780
Something has to happen in awareness, not
in a way that you just start jumping or taking

01:05:58.805 --> 01:06:02.323
out your clothes and doing nonsensical things.

01:06:04.818 --> 01:06:05.707
It’s very easy.

01:06:05.732 --> 01:06:08.063
In the bathroom everybody does it.

01:06:08.063 --> 01:06:10.123
What’s so great?

01:06:12.496 --> 01:06:14.566
But just understand.

01:06:14.591 --> 01:06:19.472
You can see with your naked eye the pulsation
of the Kundalini.

01:06:19.496 --> 01:06:20.674
Not in all.

01:06:20.675 --> 01:06:24.193
If you are a first class instrument, it just
happens.

01:06:24.193 --> 01:06:26.383
Like a jet it goes.

01:06:26.383 --> 01:06:30.333
It’s a jet Kundalini in the jet age.

01:06:30.333 --> 01:06:35.980
It has to happen to all of you.

01:06:36.005 --> 01:06:42.616
Why some people said you have to do so much
and you have to do like this and you have

01:06:42.641 --> 01:06:47.633
to do that and you have to cleanse yourself
and then only you’ll get realization.

01:06:48.032 --> 01:06:50.702
Why is it so simple today?

01:06:51.085 --> 01:06:54.663
The reason is the time has come.

01:06:54.663 --> 01:07:02.908
In the beginning of a tree’s life one or
two flowers come in, but now the blossom time

01:07:03.025 --> 01:07:09.729
has come, so many seekers I see before me,
just like flowers about to become the fruits.

01:07:09.909 --> 01:07:12.397
There were never so much seekers before.

01:07:12.422 --> 01:07:17.433
Whatever you can say against the modern times
this is the outcome of that.

01:07:17.433 --> 01:07:21.473
Without this chaos there would have been not
so many.

01:07:21.473 --> 01:07:27.293
This is the time that he predicted that many
saints will be born at this time.

01:07:27.293 --> 01:07:29.293
[UNCLEAR] imagine thousands of years back
it was written.

01:07:29.293 --> 01:07:38.272
When this Kali Yuga, this modern time, the
one who created the Kali, he was caught up

01:07:38.297 --> 01:07:43.053
by somebody and he said, “Nala, what do
mean by torturing me and my wife like this.

01:07:43.053 --> 01:07:45.293
I am going to kill you.

01:07:45.293 --> 01:07:51.662
The Kali said, “Alright, you can kill me,
but you have to find out one thing about me.

01:07:52.028 --> 01:07:56.142
You must know what I am and what I represent."

01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:57.431
“What are you?

01:07:57.456 --> 01:07:58.167
Just tell me."

01:07:58.167 --> 01:08:02.973
He said: “When the modern times will come,”
we call it as Kali Yuga, “at this time,

01:08:02.998 --> 01:08:10.316
these saints who are seeking God in the hills
and dales and in the Himalayas will be born

01:08:10.317 --> 01:08:14.479
as ordinary householders and they are going
to receive the blessings.

01:08:14.504 --> 01:08:16.193
It’s already promised."

01:08:18.368 --> 01:08:23.166
If so, that happening has to take place.

01:08:23.167 --> 01:08:29.993
But as soon as people came to know that people
are seeking, the market got jammed.

01:08:30.018 --> 01:08:32.923
and you got into the trap.

01:08:39.467 --> 01:08:45.882
It’s a very subtle method of making money
out of you.

01:08:45.907 --> 01:08:53.337
Now, I think, most of them are getting a little
worried, because all their advertising and

01:08:53.337 --> 01:08:58.165
all that is a little bit fading and they don’t
know how to find out new methods of advertising

01:08:58.190 --> 01:09:00.891
to get ‘round you.

01:09:00.916 --> 01:09:05.046
These people are not interested in Indian
villages.

01:09:05.046 --> 01:09:12.576
They are interested in Los Angeles or in Santa
Cruz where they can extract money.

01:09:12.577 --> 01:09:16.358
It is an enterprise.

01:09:16.383 --> 01:09:19.433
You cannot sell God, can you?

01:09:19.458 --> 01:09:21.753
You cannot organize it.

01:09:21.778 --> 01:09:31.407
Some lady paid $4000 very recently and I heard
somebody told me that she went there, she

01:09:31.407 --> 01:09:35.617
danced, she took out her clothes, became mad
and came back.

01:09:35.617 --> 01:09:39.493
You pay to go to lunatic asylum or what?

01:09:39.518 --> 01:09:43.957
But it helps you to go there because there’s
a fashion on.

01:09:43.957 --> 01:09:46.174
Everybody is going, “Oh, I’ve been there
to that Guru."

01:09:46.199 --> 01:09:48.815
It’s so maddening.

01:09:53.769 --> 01:09:58.439
You must understand, you are the new forms
of the old ways.

01:09:58.464 --> 01:10:06.617
In olden days, people who could donate for
a church were regarded as very religious.

01:10:06.617 --> 01:10:20.227
Even now, I think, some of the Jews, they
have a diamond-jeweled bible and if they can

01:10:20.227 --> 01:10:25.685
tithe there they show it nicely that they
have got one.

01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:32.413
All these false ideas of God you’d better
give up, because you are not followers, you

01:10:32.438 --> 01:10:33.600
are seekers.

01:10:33.811 --> 01:10:36.306
Let them go on with that nonsense.

01:10:36.331 --> 01:10:42.307
But you are seekers, so you take to the Truth
and you become that.

01:10:42.307 --> 01:10:45.637
I think today, it’s quite a lot for you.

01:10:45.637 --> 01:10:48.004
I would like you to ask me some questions,
but sensible questions and don’t be aggressive

01:10:48.029 --> 01:10:49.278
with me.

01:10:49.303 --> 01:10:50.371
I am very clever.

01:10:50.396 --> 01:10:54.398
As they told him, “She’s a masterpiece
of camouflage."

01:10:54.423 --> 01:10:57.309
It’s true, I am, so be careful.

01:10:57.334 --> 01:11:00.159
If you have any real questions ask me.

01:11:00.184 --> 01:11:06.917
If you are not a true seeker and you are just
trying to show off, you are cheating yourself.

01:11:06.917 --> 01:11:08.087
Don’t try to show off.

01:11:08.087 --> 01:11:09.009
“I read this book."

01:11:09.034 --> 01:11:10.235
“I read that book."

01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:11.068
“This happened."

01:11:11.093 --> 01:11:12.615
”What do you think of this Guru?” Don’t
bring me to controversies.

01:11:12.640 --> 01:11:13.595
It’s unnecessary.

01:11:13.620 --> 01:11:17.664
If they were of any value, you would have
been a realized soul.

01:11:17.689 --> 01:11:23.587
I can make out from you who was your Guru
the way they have ruined your Kundalini.

01:11:23.587 --> 01:11:26.467
Some of the Kundalinis are so ruined.

01:11:26.467 --> 01:11:38.587
I see them just like wounded snakes, tossing
their heads like this.

01:11:38.587 --> 01:11:40.317
It is so bleedy.

01:11:40.317 --> 01:11:42.788
You don’t know how much they’ve corrupted
you.

01:11:42.813 --> 01:11:46.184
Don’t ask me about these cruel people.

01:11:46.209 --> 01:11:50.245
If I start blasting them, you’ll be amazed
how they are.

01:11:50.270 --> 01:11:54.595
I love you very much, but I don’t love them.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:01.066
I am wrathful, very angry with them, because
they are devils, satanic.

01:12:01.091 --> 01:12:04.457
If they wanted money, they could have smuggled.

01:12:04.482 --> 01:12:11.629
They could have done something like that,
but they should not have ruined your Kundalini.

01:12:11.654 --> 01:12:13.487
They had no business to do it.

01:12:13.487 --> 01:12:21.077
They will go to hell, no doubt, but they’ll
be carrying so many with them, they know that.

01:12:21.077 --> 01:12:23.377
They are trying to overpower.

01:12:23.377 --> 01:12:25.097
They are Anti-Christ.

01:12:25.097 --> 01:12:27.026
They think they can win over God.

01:12:27.051 --> 01:12:35.738
Let them know that God’s Powers are so powerful
that they can all be destroyed like this in

01:12:35.763 --> 01:12:36.543
one stroke.

01:12:36.568 --> 01:12:42.218
The only thing why they are not destroyed
is because today they are in your brains.

01:12:43.047 --> 01:12:50.521
Krishna has said,”Whenever there is the
fall of Dharma, fall of your values, your

01:12:50.546 --> 01:13:01.946
virtues, whenever the saints suffer, I come
on this Earth to save the Saints and kill

01:13:01.974 --> 01:13:03.737
the devils."

01:13:03.737 --> 01:13:07.447
But the devils have gone into the Saints now.

01:13:07.447 --> 01:13:09.176
It’s a problem, a dilemma for me.

01:13:09.201 --> 01:13:10.277
What to do.

01:13:10.302 --> 01:13:13.887
These devils have come into your brains.

01:13:13.887 --> 01:13:16.407
They are to be taken out, first of all.

01:13:16.407 --> 01:13:18.210
Just wait for me to finish.

01:13:18.235 --> 01:13:19.854
Do not stick on to one question.

01:13:19.879 --> 01:13:22.460
If you stick on, you’ll miss the whole point.

01:13:22.485 --> 01:13:25.787
By questioning, you will not get Realization.

01:13:25.787 --> 01:13:28.457
It’s not a mental activity.

01:13:28.457 --> 01:13:31.171
It’s triggering beyond the mental activity.

01:13:31.196 --> 01:13:34.640
This lecture is useless if you do not get
your Realization.

01:13:34.665 --> 01:13:38.755
In the beginning of the Vedas it was written
that if you do not get the knowledge… Knowledge

01:13:38.780 --> 01:13:40.372
doesn’t mean going mad.

01:13:40.411 --> 01:13:42.585
It doesn’t mean hypnosis.

01:13:42.610 --> 01:13:47.557
But if you do not feel the all pervading Power,
then these Vedas are useless.

01:13:47.557 --> 01:13:51.952
In the same way my lecture and all mental
activities are useless if you do not get your

01:13:51.977 --> 01:13:52.678
Realization.

01:13:52.733 --> 01:13:54.974
That’s the main thing you must have.

01:13:55.007 --> 01:13:56.046
All right?

01:13:56.071 --> 01:13:57.090
May God bless you.

01:13:57.115 --> 01:14:05.715
Now, ask me a question.

01:14:11.902 --> 01:14:17.992
Seeker: What is the best approach we can take
to go to Laxmi?

01:14:18.017 --> 01:14:22.977
Shri Mataji: I will tell you tomorrow about
Laxmi, where she is settled down.

01:14:22.977 --> 01:14:26.107
That’s what we are going to do, all the
Goddess, not one.

01:14:26.107 --> 01:14:28.147
All in one bundle.

01:14:28.147 --> 01:14:29.828
Now what do you say to that?

01:14:29.853 --> 01:14:32.899
Alright, good idea.

01:14:42.617 --> 01:14:48.925
Seeker: Asks about how to deal with her worries.

01:14:48.950 --> 01:14:50.448
Alright, doesn’t matter.

01:14:50.473 --> 01:14:51.796
We are going to work it out.

01:14:51.821 --> 01:14:53.648
Don’t worry about your personal things.

01:14:53.673 --> 01:15:00.324
It’s all
going to work out en masse.

01:15:00.349 --> 01:15:02.349
Don’t worry about your personal things,

01:15:02.374 --> 01:15:04.374
just don´t worry.

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:05.695
There is nothing to worry

01:15:05.735 --> 01:15:07.132
it is going to work out.

01:15:07.156 --> 01:15:09.777
Is a working out I must say.

01:15:09.801 --> 01:15:11.801
Yes, please.

01:15:14.307 --> 01:15:16.507
Dr.

01:15:16.507 --> 01:15:21.397
Warren: She is asking whether you said to
say, “Mother, I am not guilty”.

01:15:21.397 --> 01:15:24.467
Shri Mataji: Yes, yes, please, within yourself.

01:15:24.467 --> 01:15:25.467
Very important.

01:15:25.467 --> 01:15:26.467
What is it?

01:15:26.467 --> 01:15:27.467
Dr.

01:15:27.467 --> 01:15:28.467
Warren:She is liking it!

01:15:28.467 --> 01:15:30.017
Shri Mataji: Good, good.

01:15:30.017 --> 01:15:31.717
May God bless you.

01:15:31.717 --> 01:15:33.827
Don’t feel guilty at all.

01:15:33.827 --> 01:15:36.117
Otherwise I would not come here.

01:15:36.117 --> 01:15:43.337
The ones who have harmed you are guilty.

01:15:51.078 --> 01:15:59.440
Seeker: What is your capacity and our capacity
to hate the devils.

01:15:59.465 --> 01:16:03.277
Most religions preached that we should not
be angry.

01:16:03.277 --> 01:16:08.867
Shri Mataji: You should not be angry, but
with Devils?

01:16:08.892 --> 01:16:12.143
You run away from them.

01:16:12.238 --> 01:16:13.238
Let me handle them.

01:16:13.262 --> 01:16:14.496
You don´t worry.

01:16:14.521 --> 01:16:16.115
You just don’t worry about them.

01:16:16.139 --> 01:16:18.139
All right?

01:16:18.153 --> 01:16:19.443
It’s my job.

01:16:19.841 --> 01:16:36.047
First of all you love yourself, have self-esteem,
know that you are the temple of God, Then

01:16:36.047 --> 01:16:40.447
you love by becoming realized, you become
collectively conscious.

01:16:40.447 --> 01:16:42.357
Again the word becoming.

01:16:42.357 --> 01:16:44.737
Then you start feeling the other within yourself.

01:16:44.737 --> 01:16:45.737
Who is the other?

01:16:45.737 --> 01:16:48.957
I am not helping you, you are part and parcel
of my being.

01:16:48.957 --> 01:16:53.045
If I am helping my finger, am I helping you?

01:16:53.070 --> 01:16:55.069
Then we see about the rest of the thing.

01:16:55.094 --> 01:17:04.766
You don’t worry about them.

01:17:19.277 --> 01:17:28.697
Seeker: Many of the people who come to my
clinic have activated their Kundalini too

01:17:28.697 --> 01:17:31.347
early and I’m wondering how to help them.

01:17:31.347 --> 01:17:37.351
Shri Mataji: They do not activate their Kundalini,
they do not.

01:17:37.376 --> 01:17:44.612
All these things are just to activate the
sympathetic and it’s very dangerous.

01:17:44.637 --> 01:17:49.227
You can get blisters, you can get all kinds
of problems.

01:17:49.227 --> 01:17:52.877
You can get cancer also.

01:17:52.877 --> 01:17:54.767
I get so many people like that.

01:17:54.767 --> 01:17:58.057
I’ll make you the masters.

01:17:58.057 --> 01:18:00.307
It’s Love.

01:18:00.307 --> 01:18:01.467
It cannot harm.

01:18:01.467 --> 01:18:03.067
It’s your Mother.

01:18:03.067 --> 01:18:07.987
That’s the only Mother you have and you
are the only child.

01:18:07.987 --> 01:18:10.297
How can your Kundalini trouble you?

01:18:10.297 --> 01:18:13.448
She is just waiting for the moment to give
you realization.

01:18:13.473 --> 01:18:23.792
She loves you the most of all.

01:18:24.521 --> 01:18:32.700
And you cannot activate it, it just spontaneously
rises.

01:18:32.725 --> 01:18:37.347
I was myself amazed to read some books on
Kundalini.

01:18:37.372 --> 01:18:39.479
I said these people don’t know what Kundalini
is.

01:18:39.504 --> 01:18:40.552
They tell lies

01:18:40.553 --> 01:18:41.626
They’re liars.

01:18:41.651 --> 01:18:47.566
They are cheats writing such big books about
Kundalini without knowing a word, without

01:18:47.591 --> 01:18:48.801
having any authority.

01:18:48.826 --> 01:18:50.896
You have to have Divine Authority, isn’t
it?

01:18:50.921 --> 01:18:54.591
You cannot get it in a Theological college
or any place you go to.

01:18:54.615 --> 01:18:55.414
You can not.

01:18:55.439 --> 01:18:57.641
Its a Divine Authority you must have.

01:19:03.502 --> 01:19:06.852
Seeker: Should we love our enemies as well?

01:19:06.877 --> 01:19:08.962
Shri Mataji: First of all you love yourself
and your friends.

01:19:08.987 --> 01:19:17.267
Then we can talk of enemies.

01:19:17.816 --> 01:19:20.702
You have to know who are your enemies.

01:19:20.727 --> 01:19:24.437
Actually, you don’t know who are your enemies.

01:19:26.057 --> 01:19:32.357
First, we have to develop that discretion
power.

01:19:32.357 --> 01:19:36.387
By your vibrations you will know who is who,
because once you are connected with the mains,

01:19:36.387 --> 01:19:38.247
you start feeling it.

01:19:38.247 --> 01:19:44.247
You can ask any question whichever is an absolute
question.

01:19:44.247 --> 01:19:45.867
You can ask is there God?

01:19:45.867 --> 01:19:48.007
You will start feeling a cool breeze coming
in.

01:19:48.007 --> 01:19:52.497
Like a computer, you become connected with
the mains and you answer all these questions.

01:19:52.497 --> 01:19:59.474
You develop your discretion and you will know
who are yours and who are not yours.

01:19:59.499 --> 01:20:06.249
Before that you don’t know, you are so mixed
up.

01:20:06.586 --> 01:20:16.646
Actually there are very few enemies that you
have, very few.

01:20:17.310 --> 01:20:20.020
Should we now have it?

01:20:21.247 --> 01:20:26.347
You’ve got that door open there.

01:20:26.347 --> 01:20:33.037
Just get one of the doors open for some of
the enemies to fly out.

01:20:33.037 --> 01:20:36.527
Dr.

01:20:36.527 --> 01:20:44.847
Warren: If anyone has their shoes on, take
them off and simply put your hands out towards

01:20:44.847 --> 01:20:50.470
Mataji as if asking for it.

01:20:50.495 --> 01:20:52.251
Be humble about it.

01:20:53.057 --> 01:20:54.521
Be open-minded.

01:20:54.546 --> 01:20:56.797
If you’ve got a lot of questions…

01:20:56.797 --> 01:20:58.467
Shri Mataji: Sit comfortably.

01:20:58.467 --> 01:21:00.887
There is nothing to put yourself to stay.

01:21:00.887 --> 01:21:05.697
Your neck should be bending neither forward
nor backward.

01:21:05.697 --> 01:21:07.997
There is no effort to be put in.

01:21:07.997 --> 01:21:08.997
Just sit comfortably.

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:11.997
Kundalini will rise by itself and you’ll
get your Realization.

01:21:11.997 --> 01:21:14.037
You don’t have to do anything.

01:21:14.037 --> 01:21:17.447
Just don’t put your concentration onto one
point.

01:21:17.447 --> 01:21:20.237
Some people have a habit of concentrating
here, concentrating there.

01:21:20.237 --> 01:21:25.157
All those people who have done this concentration
business or, what is that the another one,

01:21:25.157 --> 01:21:28.777
putting the tongue back?

01:21:28.777 --> 01:21:32.197
(kechari mudra).

01:21:32.197 --> 01:21:40.707
Whatever you have done, all such people should
put their attention here (top of head).

01:21:40.707 --> 01:21:42.257
There is the door, not here.

01:21:42.257 --> 01:21:43.277
That’s all.

01:21:43.277 --> 01:21:52.567
But rest of the people just keep your attention
absolutely loose.

01:21:52.567 --> 01:21:55.731
Now, close your eyes.

01:21:55.756 --> 01:22:03.852
Keep your eyes closed, because Kundalini has
to pass through Agnya chakra and if your eyes

01:22:03.927 --> 01:22:07.533
are not closed, she won’t rise.

01:22:07.558 --> 01:22:11.577
Put your hands towards me just like this.

01:22:11.577 --> 01:22:17.057
All of you, please put your hands, because
in the hands you have those centers.

01:22:17.057 --> 01:22:20.327
I would request you to take out if there is
anything heavy in your necks.

01:22:20.327 --> 01:22:21.567
Please, take off.

01:22:21.567 --> 01:22:22.807
It is better.

01:22:22.807 --> 01:22:27.147
Also, if there is anything heavy or tight
on your waist.

01:22:27.147 --> 01:22:37.617
You can loosen your belt a little bit.

01:22:37.617 --> 01:22:56.167
Just put your hands towards me.

01:22:56.167 --> 01:23:05.447
Close your eyes.

01:23:16.730 --> 01:23:30.727
Please, put your right hand on your heart,
because Spirit resides in our heart.

01:23:30.827 --> 01:23:35.407
Sit very comfortably without any strain on
your back.

01:23:35.407 --> 01:23:36.887
That is very important.
