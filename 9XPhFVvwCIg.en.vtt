00:00:05.473 --> 00:00:08.610
But what is the nature of innocence?

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:14.153
That we can understand from Shri Ganesha's innocence.

00:00:14.513 --> 00:00:22.433
First of all He's endowed with wisdom,

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:29.273
and He puts wisdom into us.

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:37.313
It's a nice thing now in modern times we have discovered genetics,

00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:44.793
and genetics determine our behavior and our races.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:51.913
It is He who puts genetics in us.

00:00:53.873 --> 00:00:59.873
He selects and puts it within us, our genetics,

00:01:00.873 --> 00:01:08.833
and when He puts wisdom in us, then we are wise.

00:01:10.073 --> 00:01:15.393
There is definitely a genetic of wisdom

00:01:16.553 --> 00:01:20.472
which is lacking, as we can see very clearly, in many races.

00:01:20.553 --> 00:01:22.352
They have no wisdom.

00:01:22.433 --> 00:01:25.952
They do things without wisdom.

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:31.592
They do things just for their destruction, destroying their society.

00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:35.072
They may call themselves the highest society, highest races,

00:01:35.153 --> 00:01:37.632
whatever it is - you may brand yourself with anything;

00:01:37.713 --> 00:01:40.152
but you can see from their behavior they're,

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:43.913
that they have no wisdom at all.

00:01:45.913 --> 00:01:51.113
So He's the one who puts that wisdom in us.

00:01:51.953 --> 00:01:54.232
In some people who are not yet evolved,

00:01:54.313 --> 00:01:57.472
certain races are not yet evolved to that extent,

00:01:57.553 --> 00:02:00.793
this wisdom is lacking.

00:02:01.593 --> 00:02:10.553
Apart from that, this wisdom gives us the sense of freedom.

00:02:12.673 --> 00:02:19.404
So we keep aloof from all kinds of intoxicant,

00:02:19.913 --> 00:02:23.523
all kinds of bad habits.

00:02:23.673 --> 00:02:28.115
We don't like to look at nudity.

00:02:28.393 --> 00:02:35.077
It can never become lifestyle of people who have wisdom - never.

00:02:35.913 --> 00:02:41.945
We don't indulge into extramarital nonsense.

00:02:42.273 --> 00:02:49.460
Whatever is absolutely in the center, which is dharmic, we accept.

00:02:49.541 --> 00:02:55.536
So we can see that the seed of wisdom put into us

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.759
makes us dharmic people when we grow, automatically.

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.846
We are automatically dharmic.

00:03:04.998 --> 00:03:08.518
So this wisdom is innate,

00:03:08.958 --> 00:03:13.037
just happens that when the kundalini is rising

00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:17.757
He becomes, manifesting in us -

00:03:17.838 --> 00:03:23.037
I mean, I should say, He makes us like a child.

00:03:23.118 --> 00:03:27.294
And that's what Christ has said, that you have to be like children

00:03:27.398 --> 00:03:31.717
if you have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:03:31.798 --> 00:03:34.517
You become the child,

00:03:34.598 --> 00:03:37.397
at that time you become a child.

00:03:37.478 --> 00:03:43.717
And with the kundalini rising,
that wisdom then comes into your brain,

00:03:43.798 --> 00:03:46.614
because He's sitting on the kundalini itself.

00:03:46.695 --> 00:03:49.997
He's the power in the kundalini.

00:03:50.078 --> 00:03:52.837
He gives wisdom in the brain.

00:03:52.918 --> 00:03:58.437
Once you get that wisdom, you drop out all bad habits,

00:03:58.518 --> 00:04:02.797
all your attachments which are wrong,

00:04:02.878 --> 00:04:09.437
all adharmic things that you do, everything drops out.

00:04:09.518 --> 00:04:12.317
He changes, your genetics are changed.

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:16.197
The genetics of Sahaja Yogis are, all of them will be the same,

00:04:16.278 --> 00:04:18.877
about the same I would say,

00:04:18.958 --> 00:04:25.437
and the genetics of other people would be different.

00:04:25.518 --> 00:04:28.477
Maybe Indians might have closer to it,

00:04:28.558 --> 00:04:31.661
because Indians normally are very wise people.

00:04:31.742 --> 00:04:34.310
They won't -- I mean, I would say, if you see

00:04:34.431 --> 00:04:39.357
the superiority of races from wisdom 
point of view, Indians are very wise.

00:04:39.438 --> 00:04:43.251
They won't just do some nonsensical things at all, no question.

00:04:44.298 --> 00:04:49.041
I've tried to give you some points about Shri Ganesh.

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:52.427
I think even if you give Me hundred lectures I cannot finish it,

00:04:52.508 --> 00:04:56.041
it's so great, it's like an ocean to Me.

00:04:56.122 --> 00:04:59.867
So I hope you will understand the essential,

00:04:59.948 --> 00:05:03.561
the fundamental principles of Shri Ganesha,

00:05:03.642 --> 00:05:08.482
and what is innocence is. The first is wisdom.

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:15.668
May God bless you all.
