00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:51.323
… These English young artists

00:45:51.524 --> 00:45:57.144
have really rendered it is
so remarkable, beautiful.

00:45:57.345 --> 00:46:01.548
My heart is really full of joy.

00:46:01.748 --> 00:46:09.550
All these things, if we can really
somehow or other put into the heads

00:46:09.751 --> 00:46:16.853
of people who are lost, the ignorance
in which they are just getting drowned,

00:46:17.054 --> 00:46:24.011
you just forgive them, forgive them, because
they don’t know what they are doing now.

00:46:24.212 --> 00:46:30.779
But I’m sure what he has prophesized

00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:34.018
will come true, hundred per cent.

00:46:34.219 --> 00:46:38.619
My God bless you, may God bless England.

00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:42.150
Tremendous.

00:46:42.922 --> 00:46:47.083
We have had a very, very serious sort
of a play

00:46:47.284 --> 00:46:52.253
and it’s good, because you see, hundred
years back

00:46:52.454 --> 00:46:56.485
how could this great poet see the vision
of today, you see?

00:46:56.686 --> 00:47:01.097
Not only that, he has described the house
which will be built

00:47:01.298 --> 00:47:08.141
by the Golden Builders. The house was
on Brompton Square,

00:47:08.342 --> 00:47:12.748
and he said it’s on a brook. So somehow
we had to open it out

00:47:12.949 --> 00:47:15.791
and we went down, we found there was
a brook there.

00:47:15.992 --> 00:47:24.099
It was built on the two shores, you can
say, two - [Hindi]

00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:26.318
- on the two sides of the brook.

00:47:26.519 --> 00:47:32.801
And the whole span was covered with trusses
so long as 80 feet, 90 feet.

00:47:33.002 --> 00:47:36.209
So you can imagine, there was a brook
running down below.

00:47:36.410 --> 00:47:40.738
All the description of the house,
everything, is absolutely correct.

00:47:40.939 --> 00:47:45.186
Then he has also described our first
ashram, Chelsham Road,

00:47:45.387 --> 00:47:48.922
where he said will be shattered
by a bomb –

00:47:49.123 --> 00:47:53.141
is a fact. There was. Everything that
he’s described,

00:47:53.342 --> 00:47:56.063
I mean, he’s such a detailed visionary
he was.

00:47:56.264 --> 00:48:01.941
Another is C.S. Lewis, is another great
visionary who has described

00:48:02.142 --> 00:48:08.124
our procession in India, into such details
that it’s impossible to believe.

00:48:08.325 --> 00:48:13.033
So not that they were only scholarly, but
they really were visionaries,

00:48:13.234 --> 00:48:18.486
and it’s not just imagination but is
the imagination

00:48:18.687 --> 00:48:27.701
which enters through the Divine power.
And then it reaches to Reality, so clearly.

00:48:27.909 --> 00:48:31.389
I don’t know how much these people
have worked hard for us,

00:48:31.590 --> 00:48:36.931
how much they have done for us. Even
as we have Namadeva, who has sung that:

00:48:37.132 --> 00:48:44.981
“Oh Mother, give me my Yoga”, all of them
have talked about this, sung about it.

00:48:45.182 --> 00:48:48.663
But somehow or other, in the Kali Yuga,
people have gone

00:48:48.864 --> 00:48:51.553
into darkness, into ignorance.
So forgive them.

00:48:51.754 --> 00:48:54.980
And I’m sure many will come out of it,
I’m very sure,

00:48:55.181 --> 00:48:58.207
and their visions were absolutely
correct

00:48:58.408 --> 00:49:02.344
and all those visions will be completely
fulfilled.

00:49:02.545 --> 00:49:05.436
May God bless you.
