00:00:18.415 --> 00:00:23.021
I am sorry I had to talk in Hindi because
most of them are Hindi-knowing people

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:25.961
and I've just told them what is
the importance of Bombay,

00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:32.784
and why so many incarnations came here,
and why Shri Rama

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:39.734
had to walk in the villages and the hills
and dales of Maharashtra,

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:48.094
what was the need, and the need is that
they should all develop their Sahaja Yoga.

00:00:48.119 --> 00:00:53.467
Also, this would be the last Puja
for all of you, in India.

00:00:53.492 --> 00:00:57.134
I hope you all have gained a lot
in these different Pujas

00:00:57.159 --> 00:01:02.212
and different places we have been to.

00:01:02.727 --> 00:01:07.632
Only thing is that one should remember
that Krita Yuga has started.

00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:11.815
Now Kali Yuga is over, Krita Yuga
has started, and in this Yuga

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:19.093
- that the Paramchaitanya is absolutely
effective and very efficient.

00:01:19.118 --> 00:01:24.340
Now if you do anything wrong it will
punish you.

00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:28.276
It may not punish immediately but it
will give you a suggestion,

00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:33.170
it will give you a proper signal that
something is going wrong with you.

00:01:33.195 --> 00:01:38.296
But if you do not try to control your
footsteps then you may go down very fast.

00:01:38.321 --> 00:01:41.102
So you have to be very careful about that.

00:01:41.127 --> 00:01:44.564
Actually, I have told you so many times
that there are two forces working,

00:01:44.589 --> 00:01:47.418
one which attracts you inside and one
which throws you out.

00:01:47.443 --> 00:01:54.425
So it is important for all of us,
all of us to remember

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.465
that this Krita Yuga is there, and in that
this Paramchaitanya is overactive.

00:01:59.465 --> 00:02:03.438
Also, you are rewarded. You have been
telling me so many stories,

00:02:03.463 --> 00:02:06.922
how sahaj it worked out, how sahaj
it has happened,

00:02:06.947 --> 00:02:10.402
all of you have been telling Me very
nice stories.

00:02:10.427 --> 00:02:18.603
But it is part of your play in Sahaja Yoga

00:02:18.628 --> 00:02:21.535
and that you are placed in the kingdom
of God.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.884
So, in the kingdom of God you are there,
try to enjoy it,

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.224
that's the only thing you have to do
is to enjoy the kingdom of God.

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:34.916
But if you try to, sort of, dislocate
yourself from this joy,

00:02:34.941 --> 00:02:41.991
break the connection of joy by some sort
of thinking, which is not reality,

00:02:42.016 --> 00:02:44.839
then you are responsible for yourself.

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:48.903
So, I have to tell you that keep
the connection on. Not only that,

00:02:48.928 --> 00:02:55.971
but try to make it stronger and stronger,
and become one with that divine force

00:02:55.996 --> 00:03:00.350
permanently, which will flow through you
and will not only enlighten you

00:03:00.375 --> 00:03:06.888
but will give you so many powers, and you
will see the new life in this new year.

00:03:06.913 --> 00:03:10.148
Yesterday, as I requested you, we have
to work it out now.

00:03:10.173 --> 00:03:15.044
Individually, we have to go all out to see
that we spread Sahaja Yoga

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.775
and talk about it. On this day I give you
complete freedom

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.293
to do what you like to spread Sahaja Yoga.
You need not ask Me any permissions,

00:03:24.318 --> 00:03:28.670
and you can try everything that you
want to. But should be something decent,

00:03:28.695 --> 00:03:32.819
should not be something indecent
and something which is not behoving

00:03:32.844 --> 00:03:38.542
a sahaja yogi. Even if you have to write
letters or answers or anything,

00:03:38.567 --> 00:03:41.239
even if you have to show the anger
it should be done

00:03:41.264 --> 00:03:45.695
in a very decent and a beautiful
manner.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.850
And it should show that it's a yogi
who is talking.

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:58.029
The other things, whatever problems
you have, will be solved in no time.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:03.438
But the main problem is yourself, it should
be solved by you by meditative methods.

00:04:03.463 --> 00:04:10.465
And so much attention we are paying
to all our extra-curricular activities

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:14.461
but that will definitely fail, it will
boomerang on you

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:17.379
if you do not have the foundation
of Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:17.404 --> 00:04:22.352
It is very important to keep attention
on your spirit all the time

00:04:22.377 --> 00:04:25.974
so that whatever you are doing, whatever
you are projecting,

00:04:25.999 --> 00:04:30.421
has the base and you just don't get lost.
This is a very important thing,

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:38.257
and I am sure that you will understand
that without the nourishment

00:04:38.282 --> 00:04:44.429
from the roots you cannot grow. So this
nourishment must be kept alive.

00:04:44.454 --> 00:04:45.992
May God bless you. Thank you very much.
