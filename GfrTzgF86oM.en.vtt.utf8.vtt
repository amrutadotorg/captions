00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:20.090
I bow to all the Sahaja Yogis, and all the
seekers of truth, may God bless you all.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:29.000
Is such a great thing to be back home with
all of you and to see you here blooming with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.439
joy and happiness.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:38.750
That's the fate of a Mother who has so many
children, that she goes from places to places

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:42.750
leaving some children behind but looking forward
to meeting others.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:48.400
Somehow that compensates for the separation.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:57.430
Today I think we should start on a very subtler
ideas about Sahaja Yoga, because you people

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:04.280
have understood it on the other plane of mechanism
that works it out, the Kundalini, the chakras

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.560
and all those things.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.960
But we have to see what is the problem that
faces actually human beings and why we make

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.790
such mistakes in our seeking.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.040
Is a very important thing to understand, because
unless and until we understand why we really

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.140
make mistakes or others make mistakes we can
never forgive them, and we might have a kind

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:36.560
of a high handed attitude towards others who
are now coming to Sahaja Yoga, thinking that,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.440
why did they do like that, and why did they
commit this mistake and they could have done

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440
better.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.010
But I personally think that if you look at
yourself you will know that you also committed

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:52.010
mistakes.

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.310
Everybody has committed mistakes.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.070
Some have committed more mistakes, and some
have committed less.

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:02.310
But what is the reason why human being has
been committing mistake?

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.850
That's what we should look into it.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.770
The first and foremost thing is without getting
-

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.220
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: Come along here
you can sit there is a lot of space here,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.299
come along.

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.389
Move out, move out you can sit in the center,
come along, come along, come along not to

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:23.620
feel shy there's lot of space in here.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.629
I think you'll have to have a bigger hall
now Matha?

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:37.409
Yes come along, come there's room here you
can sit down here, come along.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:39.920
So sweet of you.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.180
Thank you very much, so very kind of you thank
you, thank you.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.140
Please make yourself comfortable come along.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.329
So how are you?

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:52.970
Congratulations and God Bless.

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:59.290
Are you all right there all of you?)

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.400
Now those who have got Realization and those
who have felt the cool breeze and have matured

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:15.769
in Sahaja Yoga know that automatically you
drop out many things, automatically.

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:19.459
Now why do we do it, you see, why do we drop
things?

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.590
Even I don't ask you for it, you just drop
them, why?

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:32.999
The reason is the light of the Spirit within
ourselves empowers us to see that this is

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:34.230
wrong.

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:42.849
Like as we have got eyes, once we have eyes
we know whether we are going to fall here,

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:45.889
or we are going to slip, or what's going to
happen.

00:03:45.889 --> 00:03:51.220
In the same way, when you get this vibratory
awareness it is not an awareness only of the

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:58.239
fingers, is the awareness of the whole being
and you just drop out everything that is against

00:03:58.239 --> 00:03:59.379
your Spirit.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:03.540
I don't have to tell you.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:12.349
But without Self-Realization what happens
that reality is just a myth.

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:15.159
It's only a mental projection with which you
live.

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:17.549
You project your mind and you think this is
reality.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.139
You can call anything as reality.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:26.960
Any hallucination can be a reality, any theory
can be a reality, any absurd ideas could be

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960
a reality.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.389
I mean all religions have taken that form
now, it's very sad.

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:40.400
But all religions, which came from truth and
from reality, are nothing but mental projections,

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.919
and they're very far away from reality.

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:51.060
You can only feel, understand and assimilate
reality if you are a self-realized person.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:58.610
Unless and until this Self has expressed itself
or manifested within yourself, the light has

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.580
come into you, how are you to manage?

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.610
Whatever you try is a mental projection.

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.580
Like many people who came first, "Oh, we believe
that we are born again."

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:12.979
All right, now how can you challenge it, if
you believe into something?

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:16.410
"I believe" is the one of the great sentences
we use.

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.060
But what is that I that believes?

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.389
That's that ego.

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:24.879
That's not your Self, because you have not
yet felt the Self.

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:30.500
So to feel the Self is the most important
thing if you have to know the reality.

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:36.629
So you must excuse all others who have not
felt the Self, who have their own mental projections.

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:40.000
They might look like fanatic; they might look
like stupid people.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.129
They may look like to be very high handed
or maybe you might think they are these ego

00:05:46.129 --> 00:05:49.710
orientated pseudo-intellectuals and all sorts
of things.

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.530
But all that is mythical because that plane
on which they move is mythical itself.

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:03.160
Whatever you know through your mental projection
is imagination itself.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.530
But Spirit is the reality, and to know the
reality you have to be the Spirit.

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:17.530
And once the Spirit starts shining within
you, you just drop everything like hot brick.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:24.350
Like I would say, as I've many times told
you, that in our human awareness we know what

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.000
is beauty is, we know what cleanliness is.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:30.430
For a dog he doesn't understand cleanliness.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:38.319
If you don't give him a bath he'll be quite
happy, actually to give him a bath is a problem.

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:42.860
But to a human being, you see, what is a sin
or what is wrong?

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.169
Sin is nothing but whatever is against the
Spirit, is sin.

00:06:49.169 --> 00:06:54.409
Even fear is a sin.

00:06:54.409 --> 00:07:02.710
Any such small little sins or the big sins,
all are nothing, but they are all against

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:05.210
the Spirit.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:11.620
But if you have not felt the Spirit whatever
you do will amount to something like anti-Spirit,

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.340
because you don't know what you are doing.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:20.810
Now the prophets have tried their level best
to tell you that you must keep your balance,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:29.960
you have to follow a certain religion as they
call it, or as we call it dharma within yourself.

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.669
But that to for what?

00:07:32.669 --> 00:07:35.099
Why to have the balance within you?

00:07:35.099 --> 00:07:39.060
People will always say, "What's wrong?"

00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.999
"What's wrong if we are not in balance, what's
there?

00:07:41.999 --> 00:07:43.249
What's wrong in drinking?"

00:07:43.249 --> 00:07:45.430
I never said don't drink before Realization.

00:07:45.430 --> 00:07:48.300
After Realization you yourself drop out.

00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:50.530
But they say, "What's wrong, why does he tell
us like this?

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:55.279
Why should we listen to them?"

00:07:55.279 --> 00:07:56.279
Why the balance?

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:59.620
The balance is needed for the ascent.

00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:04.020
Unless and until you have a balance how will
you ascend?

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:06.270
Imagine an aeroplane without any balance.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:12.379
Say a wing is missing, will it be able to
take off from the ground, cannot.

00:08:12.379 --> 00:08:16.759
So for the ascent it is necessary to have
the necessary balance.

00:08:16.759 --> 00:08:18.940
So they said, "Keep in the balance."

00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:27.550
But even when we're just told simple thing
to keep to the central path, to lead a life

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:37.820
of balancing yourself or moderation in your
life, in that also the moderation part of

00:08:37.820 --> 00:08:41.950
it they have made it an extreme.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:47.920
Everything has been made into an extreme,
because religion also they want to follow

00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:49.810
through their mental conception.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.960
That's why you find all these religions is
a mess.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:58.180
But I would not blame them for that because
they had no other instrument to go ahead,

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.010
and they wanted to go ahead.

00:09:00.010 --> 00:09:05.500
They had no other way to proceed further so
they used only one engine they had was this

00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:06.500
mental projection.

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:12.890
And they made all these various projections
and that's how they are so diversified and

00:09:12.890 --> 00:09:15.130
separated from each other.

00:09:15.130 --> 00:09:25.980
But as soon as your Spirit shines, then, everything
drops out by itself because it is beyond mind.

00:09:25.980 --> 00:09:33.980
Spirit is beyond mind, I don't have to tell
you anything that you must have balance, you

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:35.490
develop a balance.

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:40.020
If you don't have a balance you'll just get
vibrations in one hand, other hand will be

00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:43.510
just cold or will be hot, so you start giving
your balance.

00:09:43.510 --> 00:09:48.631
But I don't say that give a balance means
following a particular religion or anything

00:09:48.631 --> 00:09:55.200
because if I say that half of you may run
away.

00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:09.030
The beauty of Self-Realization lies in secretly
working out within you, everything that is

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:17.960
virtuous, that is beautiful, that is joyful,
secretly, it doesn't tell you.

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:22.100
For example now supposing somebody has an
imbalance on the right hand side.

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.760
Very intellectual fellow, and thinking for
the future and futuristic man you see, forgetting

00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:30.460
all his past.

00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:34.110
Even there are people I've known they have
forgotten their names, and the names of their

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:35.500
wives.

00:10:35.500 --> 00:10:38.930
But they are so futuristic.

00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:43.910
For such a person if you tell them don't think
about the future, he can't do it because he's

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:45.380
put his attention like this.

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:51.030
The whole ego portion has gone that side and
he's all looking forward to the future.

00:10:51.030 --> 00:10:59.440
But if you put him somehow or other, in a
state where his Self-Realization takes place

00:10:59.440 --> 00:11:04.950
then immediately he will say, "Mother, my
right hand is burning and there's nothing

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:06.090
in the left hand."

00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:13.120
So you start talking on a very mundane way,
not in a very subtle manner like all the philosophers

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:14.120
talk.

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:20.290
All right that means your right is not getting
proper vibrations, so you raise your left

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.360
to the right?

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.060
Now for an intellectual he can't understand,
"What is this raising left to the right.

00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:29.360
I have read Bhagavad-Gita, I have read Bible,
I've done Koran, I have done this, nowhere

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:30.360
written left to the right.

00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:32.840
What do you mean by this kind of a nonsense,
you see that you have to put your hand just

00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:37.470
left to the right and you get the balance?"

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:45.830
I cannot appeal to a mind which has been thinking
about God, religion, everything, all right.

00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:53.190
So the secretive working of the Kundalini
is such, that She goes in that portion where

00:11:53.190 --> 00:11:54.190
you need help.

00:11:54.190 --> 00:12:02.290
She works it out and She raises you and gradually
She transforms you.

00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:10.830
But if it is not awakened, if it has not yet
touched the Sahasrara, means if it has not

00:12:10.830 --> 00:12:18.260
touched the feet of your Spirit, it may not
be interested, it may not be interested.

00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:27.650
So the first and foremost thing is to raise
the Kundalini, and to let Her at least once

00:12:27.650 --> 00:12:30.390
know that She has touched the Spirit.

00:12:30.390 --> 00:12:35.890
Then She has interest, otherwise She hasn't
got any interest.

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:41.010
That's why you must have seen some people
who come to Sahaja Yoga and just drop out.

00:12:41.010 --> 00:12:44.740
The reason is the Kundalini Itself is not
interested.

00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:52.390
So the foremost duty of every Sahaja Yogi
is, first of all, not to be angry or annoyed

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:56.110
with people who have done lots of wrong.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.470
But be very kind to them and gentle because
they are just seekers of truth.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:01.520
How can you be angry with them?

00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:06.570
Already we have lost so many of them because
of their stupidity.

00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:11.010
But we must try to salvage as many as possible.

00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:18.800
And then the second duty of every Sahaja Yogi
is to slowly steadily to convince the person

00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:20.250
that he should become the Spirit.

00:13:20.250 --> 00:13:24.570
Of course you'll meet so many who will be
self-appointed people they'll say, "Oh, I've

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.070
already met the Spirit, I am the Spirit.

00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:27.070
I'm Christ."

00:13:27.070 --> 00:13:35.200
They can say anything, so soothe them down
a little, bring them down and raise their

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:39.780
Kundalini, but don't leave it half way, must
touch the Sahasrara.

00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:45.180
I have seen some of the Sahaja Yogis, even
in India I've seen, they just give up.

00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.490
They'll sit down, "Oh Mother forget it, we
don't want to do it, it's like a mountain

00:13:49.490 --> 00:13:50.690
we can't raise it."

00:13:50.690 --> 00:13:55.790
But we have to work, that's what we have to
do is to work it out.

00:13:55.790 --> 00:14:01.520
Raise the Kundalini, pierce through the Sahasrara,
and then Kundalini will work it out.

00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:06.230
It was a question asked to Me, "Mother that
we gave Realization to so many people, out

00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:10.060
of that only about thirty percent people are
coming up the rest are lost."

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:16.020
The reason is you have left it half done.

00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:24.570
So this is one of the reasons why we have
lost some people and there is no connection

00:14:24.570 --> 00:14:25.570
still established.

00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:32.510
Now those people who come to Sahaja Yoga you
have to really work hard on them.

00:14:32.510 --> 00:14:35.180
Instead of arguing with them, because what
will you argue is all mental projection.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.620
On what point are you going to argue with
them because that is not going to give them

00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.640
the light of the Spirit.

00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:49.860
So somehow or other work it out in such a
way that they feel light of the Spirit, then

00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:50.860
talk.

00:14:50.860 --> 00:14:55.110
But we think that if we talk to them it will
help.

00:14:55.110 --> 00:14:59.930
It's not question of conviction, is the question
of happening, is question of becoming, which

00:14:59.930 --> 00:15:00.930
is important.

00:15:00.930 --> 00:15:08.950
Unless and until they become, what is the
use of argument, there's no law court here.

00:15:08.950 --> 00:15:11.290
There is no debate going on, there is no election.

00:15:11.290 --> 00:15:16.920
There's nothing of the kind, it is something
that has to happen to all those people that

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:20.780
they should get their light of their Spirit.

00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:27.190
And once they get it, then it is very much
easier for you to talk to them and tell them

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:28.190
about it.

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:35.370
The 
philosophy of Sahaja Yoga is extremely simple.

00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:38.170
Is the simplest of all philosophy you can
think of.

00:15:38.170 --> 00:15:48.000
Is a very simple philosophy, is that, once
you get your Realization you start feeling

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.110
for the first time, the All Pervading Power
and forget everything else.

00:15:54.110 --> 00:16:00.300
Once you get that feeling of the All Pervading
Power only you have know how to maneuver it,

00:16:00.300 --> 00:16:05.670
how to work it out and how to use it for your
own growth.

00:16:05.670 --> 00:16:15.170
It is made easy, it has to be as it is the
most vital force that has to take place in

00:16:15.170 --> 00:16:16.610
the realm of spirituality.

00:16:16.610 --> 00:16:19.850
Now thank God, many gurus are exposed.

00:16:19.850 --> 00:16:24.880
Thank God many myths that were working out
are being now blasted.

00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.970
When I was telling you people about the promiscuousness
and all those things, that this will never

00:16:29.970 --> 00:16:35.880
lead you to God but to hell, I remember when
people criticized Me to be Victorian.

00:16:35.880 --> 00:16:41.350
I mean people have ideas, which is a very
Victorian ideas, and also saying that Mother

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:46.070
is very matronly and all sorts of English
language you see, that they could use about

00:16:46.070 --> 00:16:47.070
Me.

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:54.350
But now you see, what have recently I've told,
thank God there have been a film showing the

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:59.930
diseases we get by promiscuous life.

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:04.559
The right sane attitude towards life definitely
helps you very much.

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:10.110
But thank God, the grace of God is so great
that once you get Realization you become such

00:17:10.110 --> 00:17:15.660
a different person that everything drops out.

00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.959
You are really a transformed personality and
so that one should know whatever was the past

00:17:20.959 --> 00:17:21.959
is finished now, is no more there.

00:17:21.959 --> 00:17:23.650
The egg is finished, is the bird.

00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:35.320
And whom to blame, whom to talk about is the
bird there, now let the bird find its own

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:37.320
wings and fly.

00:17:37.320 --> 00:17:41.880
Once you understand this simple thing of Sahaja
Yoga is that we have to make every one feel

00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:44.380
the All Pervading Power of God, to begin with.

00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:52.340
Unless and until they have felt it we have
not to accept them as realized souls.

00:17:52.340 --> 00:17:53.430
They have to feel it.

00:17:53.430 --> 00:17:56.960
Now of course as you know if the Vishuddhi
chakra is not all right they may not feel

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:57.960
it in the hands.

00:17:57.960 --> 00:18:04.020
But still no use if you tell them that according
to us you are a realized soul but according

00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:06.770
to you, you are not feeling.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:08.880
You see because the mind is working.

00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:14.970
Instead of feeling a little disturbed about
it, upset about it, they may just think that,

00:18:14.970 --> 00:18:20.520
you see, it's just a make believe or a psychological
stuff and I didn't feel it, I'm a person of

00:18:20.520 --> 00:18:25.850
great will power, that attitude, yes, many
feel like that.

00:18:25.850 --> 00:18:28.210
So they can be lost.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:39.600
For now as our Sahaja Yoga is increasing everywhere
in the world, we have so many good Sahaja

00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:41.880
Yogis in England now.

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:48.600
They are sensible people and uniquely placed
in this great country.

00:18:48.600 --> 00:19:02.190
And they have to understand that wisdom is
higher than intellect, and discretion is higher

00:19:02.190 --> 00:19:04.480
than debating.

00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:10.320
Take a very kindly and a compassionate attitude
towards the rest of the people, and then work

00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:20.010
it out that they should somehow or other,
feel this subtle force of God's love.

00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.370
Then gradually try to bring them round and
teach them what you've got.

00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:32.930
Is easy to blame their ego, it's very easy,
to say, "Oh, they're ego orientated, throw

00:19:32.930 --> 00:19:35.730
them away," very easy to say that.

00:19:35.730 --> 00:19:37.570
But that's not their mistake.

00:19:37.570 --> 00:19:39.040
That's not their doing.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.900
It was because they never felt the Spirit
before.

00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:48.690
Whatever they have they have used that instrument
whether ego or super ego and they have built

00:19:48.690 --> 00:19:53.360
up their own self, in that kind of a fort.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:20:02.350
But this barrier can be broken very easily
as soon as they get their Realization.

00:20:02.350 --> 00:20:05.460
I found the same thing in Australia.

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.220
When I went there so many came back, so many.

00:20:08.220 --> 00:20:11.210
And now we have everywhere quite a lot of
people.

00:20:11.210 --> 00:20:17.030
In every ashram now we have coming at least
thousand to two thousand people.

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:20.550
We have five centers now and it's working
out very well.

00:20:20.550 --> 00:20:24.110
Same thing is in England, we can work it out.

00:20:24.110 --> 00:20:31.510
But I told them the same thing that reality
is a different thing, and a mental projection

00:20:31.510 --> 00:20:32.510
is a different thing.

00:20:32.510 --> 00:20:34.720
You still do not talk on that level to these
people.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:40.140
Because you just increase their mental projection
and their barriers within them and this has

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:41.270
helped them a lot.

00:20:41.270 --> 00:20:45.740
And you'll be amazed that those people who
were lost have come back to Sahaja Yoga and

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:48.360
are growing very fast within themselves.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:56.010
Now for the new people I have to tell, you
have to have patience with yourself.

00:20:56.010 --> 00:20:57.010
You have to have patience.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:21:04.310
As I have patience for you, I have love for
you, I am here only because of you.

00:21:04.310 --> 00:21:10.770
You also must have patience for yourself and
full confidence in yourself that you'll become

00:21:10.770 --> 00:21:12.220
the Spirit.

00:21:12.220 --> 00:21:16.670
If you have these two things, I'm sure it
will work out.

00:21:16.670 --> 00:21:19.550
It is going to work out.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:25.240
Once you get your Realization you have to
work out on other people, and gradually you

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:34.100
will be amazed that it will grow, and it will
convince you, and you will know that you have

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:37.160
become the realized soul.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:43.720
But the realized souls are very simple people.

00:21:43.720 --> 00:21:48.590
If they say, "I am a realized soul," nobody
can believe them because there are no horns

00:21:48.590 --> 00:21:50.310
around them.

00:21:50.310 --> 00:21:57.440
No gurudom around them, nothing of the kind,
they're extremely simple people.

00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:06.360
So what is going to help you is a simple attitude
toward yourself and toward these Sahaja Yogis,

00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:11.010
and towards Sahaja Yoga that you have come
here to become the Spirit.

00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:13.340
We have to gain nothing from you.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:18.950
There's no clientele as such, there's no money
proposition, nothing.

00:22:18.950 --> 00:22:25.670
It is you who have come to the Ganges, to
take the holy water, it is you who has to

00:22:25.670 --> 00:22:26.670
take it.

00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:29.620
We are here to help you.

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:37.270
If that attitude is developed I'm sure, with
your co-operation, we can change the face

00:22:37.270 --> 00:22:38.470
of this world.

00:22:38.470 --> 00:22:53.800
And as William Blake has said in this Hampstead,
"We have to build up Jerusalem here."

00:22:53.800 --> 00:23:05.210
May God Bless you all.

00:23:05.210 --> 00:23:13.090
Any questions you have you ask?

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:25.970
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: This is not a loud
speaker.

00:23:25.970 --> 00:23:44.290
I think I better present you with a loud speaker.

00:23:44.290 --> 00:24:02.390
What happened, you presented one to India
why don't you get one.

00:24:02.390 --> 00:24:14.400
Further conversation about the speaker)

00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:26.410
Any questions to request Me?

00:24:26.410 --> 00:24:52.270
Seeker asks a question: - How can one who
is new this subject distinguish between what

00:24:52.270 --> 00:25:17.870
is psychic phenomena and what is actually
the manifestation of the Spirit itself?

00:25:17.870 --> 00:25:30.170
[Seeker gives a long introduction to this
question which is unclear.]

00:25:30.170 --> 00:25:33.260
Shri Mataji: is good idea.

00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:35.740
May God bless you.

00:25:35.740 --> 00:25:45.470
You see when they say they have felt the cool
breeze the psychic people they are telling

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.270
lies, simple as that.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:26:05.679
Because the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost,
that you feel, has not only the cool breeze

00:26:05.679 --> 00:26:09.190
it has its own powers.

00:26:09.190 --> 00:26:16.470
For example, now I say there is a flame here,
all right.

00:26:16.470 --> 00:26:29.940
Now if there is a blind man also if he puts
his finger round there he will know it's a

00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:35.780
flame isn't it, because he can feel the heat.

00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:56.330
In the same way this cool breeze is just to
feel this cool breeze but is a dynamic stuff.

00:26:56.330 --> 00:27:10.820
You can, when you get this cool breeze established
within yourself, you'll be amazed that under

00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:19.810
your hand the Kundalini will pulsate, it will
rise, and you will feel the cool breeze of

00:27:19.810 --> 00:27:22.290
another person.

00:27:22.290 --> 00:27:31.940
With this cool breeze you can cure diseases
like cancer and many other.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.600
With this cool breeze you can give balances
to people.

00:27:35.600 --> 00:27:39.220
Everything you can do with this cool breeze,
is tremendous.

00:27:39.220 --> 00:27:48.770
If you have any, say question, any question,
supposing you are a realized soul, you want

00:27:48.770 --> 00:27:53.880
to know about a guru if he is real or not.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:57.549
If it's a psychic thing you won't get anything.

00:27:57.549 --> 00:28:04.623
You won't know why psychic people are all
going to parapsychology, is all wrong, it's

00:28:04.623 --> 00:28:06.180
a horrible stuff.

00:28:06.180 --> 00:28:15.720
This parapsychology is one of the worst things
that can happen to a human being, but they

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.400
don't know what it is.

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:21.620
There's nothing absolute about it.

00:28:21.620 --> 00:28:27.260
But the cool breeze is the one that gives
you complete absolute idea.

00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.940
Like you want to know is there God?

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:35.530
Ask a simple question like that, "Mother is
there God?"

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:37.820
You'll get a cool breeze.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:45.170
Now it's so, discrimination is so great and
so precise that supposing you want to know

00:28:45.170 --> 00:28:52.310
about a guru how he is, supposing he's a devil
then you might get even blisters on your hand.

00:28:52.310 --> 00:28:53.310
You might even get tremendous heat in your
hand and vibrations will stop completely.

00:28:53.310 --> 00:28:56.840
But supposing he's half way then you may not
get such bad effects but there won't be any

00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:57.940
breeze at all.

00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:05.320
But supposing he's a realized soul, for William
Blake for example, I don't have to ask I know,

00:29:05.320 --> 00:29:15.340
but unless and until you really feel that
cool breeze in your hand in a real way, also

00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:27.180
it's coming out of your head then you should
not believe that you have got a Realization,

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:31.800
you should not believe into it.

00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:42.100
Now they are many psychic cases I know who
told Me, "We have always felt the cool breeze,"

00:29:42.100 --> 00:29:52.110
because they cannot accept it, just say, and
their Kundalini just frozen there.

00:29:52.110 --> 00:29:57.610
Nothing of the kind, I'm getting terrible
heat and just praying if this person goes

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:03.920
away for a while will be good rest for Me.

00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:08.940
And he says, "No, no but I have felt the cool
breeze."

00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:13.140
All the time he's telling Me lies.

00:30:13.140 --> 00:30:16.850
"I have always felt the cool breeze everywhere."

00:30:16.850 --> 00:30:32.050
But the Kundalini is down below you can feel
it yourself, you can see for yourself.

00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:37.200
If the Kundalini is not here how are you feeling
the cool breeze?

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.510
You cannot.

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:50.280
Is a phenomena as a result of something it's
not just a phenomena of the cool breeze.

00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:57.320
But when the Kundalini rises above the Sahasrara
then only you can feel the cool breeze.

00:30:57.320 --> 00:31:05.390
I've seen many people like that.

00:31:05.390 --> 00:31:12.160
They don't want to accept, oh that I've got
all this.

00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:17.180
But supposing there are people who are born
realized.

00:31:17.180 --> 00:31:21.110
There are people, some people who feel the
cool breeze.

00:31:21.110 --> 00:31:25.740
Now you have to differentiate between them
and the unreal people.

00:31:25.740 --> 00:31:29.540
There can be some people who are born realized.

00:31:29.540 --> 00:31:32.059
But nowadays we have decided not to tell them
that they are born realized because, those

00:31:32.059 --> 00:32:00.610
who came to us we told them they're born realized,
their ego suddenly inflated like this.

00:32:00.610 --> 00:32:04.430
You see absolutely gone cases and we lost
them.

00:32:04.430 --> 00:32:18.800
Because you see, if you are a born realized
it's nothing great, nothing great, because

00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:22.380
so many are realized.

00:32:22.380 --> 00:32:36.700
Supposing you get Realization today all right,
so you'll be a realized soul, but you're not

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:39.390
a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:39.390 --> 00:33:00.450
Sahaja Yogi is a person who not only is a
realized soul but he knows all the technique

00:33:00.450 --> 00:33:03.850
of this pure knowledge.

00:33:03.850 --> 00:33:18.970
He knows all the laws of the Divine happening
and also he knows how to handle the Kundalini.

00:33:18.970 --> 00:33:25.100
Sahaja Yogi is a knowledgeable person the
one who knows all about it.

00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:36.410
Who knows all the permutations and combinations,
who knows how to maneuver it and everything

00:33:36.410 --> 00:33:38.160
about it.

00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:44.500
So he's you can say a boy who enters into
the first class.

00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:49.100
He just knows one plus one is two.

00:33:49.100 --> 00:34:21.420
But say a professor of mathematics, there's
a big difference between the two.

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:27.639
So even if somebody's a born realized it's
better not to tell him that you are born realized

00:34:27.639 --> 00:34:31.889
because he suddenly thinks he has become a
professor.

00:34:31.889 --> 00:34:35.450
Imagine a little boy thinking that he's become
a professor.

00:34:35.450 --> 00:34:40.619
It is very detrimental to him as well as to
others.

00:34:40.619 --> 00:34:46.569
So best thing is to get the cool breeze in
the right sense, in the right way and understand

00:34:46.569 --> 00:34:47.909
that it works, it must work.

00:34:47.909 --> 00:34:50.429
As you see how do you make out a real note
and an unreal note?

00:34:50.429 --> 00:34:52.859
The real note it works.

00:34:52.859 --> 00:35:00.980
So it's not a myth it's a reality, again I
say it's a reality.

00:35:00.980 --> 00:35:05.470
Supposing this is an artificial thing it won't
work.

00:35:05.470 --> 00:35:09.920
Anything that is artificial doesn't work,
all right?

00:35:09.920 --> 00:35:16.200
You go to this Madame Tussaud's place and
you'll find so many people sitting looking

00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:23.869
exactly like us you see, but they are not
living, all right, you understand My point?

00:35:23.869 --> 00:35:29.009
So you have to master it, know it fully.

00:35:29.009 --> 00:35:34.710
You have to master it and understand it.

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:43.390
You see unless and until you understand it
to that extent, you cannot reach any conclusion,

00:35:43.390 --> 00:35:49.010
all right, and we have to work it out.

00:35:49.010 --> 00:35:51.490
May God Bless you.

00:35:51.490 --> 00:36:02.249
Is not only thing that is cool breeze, where
is your Kundalini, whether it has risen or

00:36:02.249 --> 00:36:19.630
not, if the cool breeze is coming out of the
head.

00:36:19.630 --> 00:36:26.170
Only a Sahaja Yogi can say, nobody can say
that.

00:36:26.170 --> 00:36:31.200
I've seen many people who get even the cool
breeze coming out of their head they cannot

00:36:31.200 --> 00:36:39.029
feel it because their hands are not sensitive.

00:36:39.029 --> 00:36:46.450
Only a Sahaja Yogi can say, is true.

00:36:46.450 --> 00:37:11.499
But that doesn't mean that a Sahaja Yogi is
something out of the blue, is just like you.

00:37:11.499 --> 00:37:35.339
Only thing is he has grown into a new awareness,
which you are going to grow yourself.

00:37:35.339 --> 00:37:41.000
(UNCLEAR- Mother speaks to seeker)

00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:55.210
In Sahaja Yoga there are so many ways and
methods how we work out all the help from

00:37:55.210 --> 00:37:58.460
all the elements, how we work it.

00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:03.319
For example, this gentleman say for example,
I find his left side is overloaded.

00:38:03.319 --> 00:38:14.059
You can ask the Mother Earth to take away
the problem.

00:38:14.059 --> 00:38:20.630
Just put left hand towards Me and right hand
on the Mother Earth, you can get cured, you

00:38:20.630 --> 00:38:21.630
will feel better.

00:38:21.630 --> 00:38:22.630
Feeling better now?

00:38:22.630 --> 00:38:23.630
Just wait, have patience.

00:38:23.630 --> 00:38:24.630
It will work.

00:38:24.630 --> 00:38:25.630
Any other question?

00:38:25.630 --> 00:38:27.950
You must see that the person is transformed.

00:38:27.950 --> 00:38:29.943
They may say anything the person must be transformed.

00:38:29.943 --> 00:38:31.190
He must become a saint.

00:38:31.190 --> 00:38:40.140
And the saint is not a person who calls himself
a saint, but a saintly person is that one

00:38:40.140 --> 00:38:41.259
who drops out all nonsensical things, automatically.

00:38:41.259 --> 00:38:42.259
Nothing sticks to it.

00:38:42.259 --> 00:38:47.269
As they say, "The lotus leaf you see, if you
put water on the lotus leaf the water drops

00:38:47.269 --> 00:38:48.670
out, nothing sticks to it."

00:38:48.670 --> 00:38:53.150
I think in England at least seventy percent
or maybe say sixty percent people have been

00:38:53.150 --> 00:38:55.059
drug addicts, Sahaja Yogis, you can't believe
they were.

00:38:55.059 --> 00:38:56.680
If not addicts they were something like that.

00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:03.339
I used to call them drugists and chemists,
but they're different today.

00:39:03.339 --> 00:39:04.339
Any other question please?

00:39:04.339 --> 00:39:11.640
(Question- Is the artificial raising of the
Kundalini dangerous?)

00:39:11.640 --> 00:39:13.619
Yes first.

00:39:13.619 --> 00:39:23.499
You see the trouble is, those who have written
about it have no authority.

00:39:23.499 --> 00:39:25.029
I have said about it many a times.

00:39:25.029 --> 00:39:37.059
Like say a villager comes to the city and
puts his hand in the plug you see, and gets

00:39:37.059 --> 00:39:47.730
a shock and says electricity is very dangerous,
all right, is like that.

00:39:47.730 --> 00:39:51.160
But Kundalini is your Mother.

00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.910
You have only one Mother and She has only
one son.

00:39:55.910 --> 00:39:57.670
It's your individual Mother.

00:39:57.670 --> 00:40:02.079
You don't share it even with your brother
or sister.

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.400
She's your Mother.

00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.049
She doesn't trouble you at all.

00:40:06.049 --> 00:40:12.950
She's your the greatest well wisher who's
born again and again with you waiting for

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:15.470
this time, there's no question.

00:40:15.470 --> 00:40:22.960
But those who are unauthorized harm the Kundalinis
of thousands of people.

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.210
People have seen that.

00:40:24.210 --> 00:40:27.059
Because you see that's My nature perhaps that
I can do it.

00:40:27.059 --> 00:40:36.170
But then people feel very hurt you know they
can't understand why should Mother do it.

00:40:36.170 --> 00:40:40.210
I said, "You better do it.

00:40:40.210 --> 00:40:56.269
It's good I should retire, I'm sixty years
of age is better for Me to retire, you should

00:40:56.269 --> 00:40:57.269
do it."

00:40:57.269 --> 00:41:13.720
But if you are doing so many things, you know
I don't know how to drive, I don't know many

00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.491
things that you do.

00:41:18.491 --> 00:41:25.539
I know one thing, how to raise Kundalini.

00:41:25.539 --> 00:41:36.240
So if something is difficult and is done easily
means that person is a master of that.

00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:42.869
And if that person is a master doesn't matter
there are masters of everything, all right.

00:41:42.869 --> 00:41:50.470
So far I haven't seen anybody suffering because
of Kundalini and should not.

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:59.079
But it's not an easy thing for many people
because I met some saints this time and they

00:41:59.079 --> 00:42:03.940
said, "It's only You who can do it Mother
we can't."

00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:17.519
There's a fellow called Gaugan (Not sure of
the name - SG) Maharaja, a very old man and

00:42:17.519 --> 00:42:36.280
he lives in a forest on top of a hill and
he's come to Me also.

00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:49.660
And he has many disciples and one of them
he told him to do this and do that you see,

00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:56.339
the balancing part of it, and he did all those
things for fourteen years.

00:42:56.339 --> 00:43:03.769
And suddenly in a program in Kolhapur he just
came to see Me, and got his Realization.

00:43:03.769 --> 00:43:14.869
He was shocked that, "Fourteen years I've
been doing all this and I never got it and

00:43:14.869 --> 00:43:25.059
how is it in a short time I got it?"

00:43:25.059 --> 00:43:31.230
So he went to see Gaugan Maharaja so he told
him about Me.

00:43:31.230 --> 00:43:33.609
He said, "She's different."

00:43:33.609 --> 00:43:48.369
So that's how it is, and I feel rather embarrassed
to talk about it, all right?

00:43:48.369 --> 00:43:51.630
May God Bless you.

00:43:51.630 --> 00:44:01.440
(Question by seeker: -: How do you relate
Your experiences or what You are talking to

00:44:01.440 --> 00:44:06.869
us about with traditional yogic practices?)

00:44:06.869 --> 00:44:09.589
Very much so.

00:44:09.589 --> 00:44:17.269
Very much, it is the most traditional thing,
you see.

00:44:17.269 --> 00:44:25.180
Because the yogic practices you do here is
some sort of a, I don't know what to call

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:41.239
it, but it's like just a wee bit of it you've
have taken are doing that, that's not yogic

00:44:41.239 --> 00:44:43.140
practice at all.

00:44:43.140 --> 00:44:52.979
You see Patanjali Yoga, which was practiced
thousands of years back, when people led a

00:44:52.979 --> 00:44:57.009
different type of life.

00:44:57.009 --> 00:45:04.079
When the children went to school with the
gurus, who was a realized soul.

00:45:04.079 --> 00:45:10.880
Nobody who was not a realized soul was called
a guru.

00:45:10.880 --> 00:45:26.700
And the children had to lead a very celibate
life because according to your university,

00:45:26.700 --> 00:45:31.359
you see, you're called as your gotras.

00:45:31.359 --> 00:45:42.060
And you could not believe it today, say my
gotra is Shandilya.

00:45:42.060 --> 00:45:48.219
Shandilya was the muni of My family.

00:45:48.219 --> 00:46:00.509
I can't marry a man from the same gotra even
today.

00:46:00.509 --> 00:46:16.499
Thousands of years have passed since then,
Shandilya lived about forty, fifty thousand

00:46:16.499 --> 00:46:34.900
years back, but even today I can't marry a
man who belongs to 

00:46:34.900 --> 00:46:38.539
the same gotra.

00:46:38.539 --> 00:46:50.220
So the celibacy you can imagine, that from
one university you could not marry.

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:58.950
That's how they lived a life and then they
went, after five years of age, they went to

00:46:58.950 --> 00:47:07.200
those schools, they lived there and they came
out of that in complete celibate living they

00:47:07.200 --> 00:47:08.200
were.

00:47:08.200 --> 00:47:19.789
And then they got married and then when they
had children they sent them back, like that

00:47:19.789 --> 00:47:22.500
the system was.

00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:36.029
But if you read Patanjali Yoga the first thing
that Patanjali Yoga said that, "Ishwara Pranitana

00:47:36.029 --> 00:47:40.559
(MAYBE Prathistana - SG)," means the establishment
of God.

00:47:40.559 --> 00:47:43.180
First you must establish the Spirit.

00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:53.410
It's like we have not yet started the car
for example, all right, it's very logical.

00:47:53.410 --> 00:48:06.799
Now I'm coming to Hampstead, I don't know
the way, supposing, and I don't know which

00:48:06.799 --> 00:48:08.569
way to go.

00:48:08.569 --> 00:48:21.589
Now supposing I say that all right now I have
to go to Hampstead, from the very beginning

00:48:21.589 --> 00:48:33.749
I'll turn to the left and not to the right,
can I do it, no?

00:48:33.749 --> 00:48:53.099
So when the Kundalini rises then only you
will know which chakra is catching what is

00:48:53.099 --> 00:48:55.019
your problem.

00:48:55.019 --> 00:49:04.650
Beforehand supposing you are doing any, at
random, any exercises.

00:49:04.650 --> 00:49:19.150
Say example, the way people are doing these
days yoga, so called, it has nothing to do

00:49:19.150 --> 00:49:20.559
with yoga.

00:49:20.559 --> 00:49:31.400
You see these exercises when you do, you are
not aware as to what are your problems.

00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:44.259
You don't know what you are suffering from
and what particular asana is needed for a

00:49:44.259 --> 00:49:57.829
particular type of a chakra, which is blocked,
all right.

00:49:57.829 --> 00:50:07.059
So what you're doing is indiscriminate, taking
medicines without understanding.

00:50:07.059 --> 00:50:10.440
But the practice of these things are a very
minimum part of the whole of Patanjali.

00:50:10.440 --> 00:50:13.229
First is Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana
- SG) means when you establish the Spirit.

00:50:13.229 --> 00:50:19.859
Ishwara Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana - SG)
means the establishment of the God.

00:50:19.859 --> 00:50:28.450
Once you have established that, then the Kundalini
starts moving and then you know where to stop,

00:50:28.450 --> 00:50:31.630
where to turn, how to do.

00:50:31.630 --> 00:50:45.150
This is real tradition, but the last fifty
years, you see, all sorts of nonsensical people

00:50:45.150 --> 00:50:48.319
have come up.

00:50:48.319 --> 00:50:56.609
They've changed this, changed that and is
logical, is logical you see.

00:50:56.609 --> 00:51:02.809
Supposing you are suffering from Agnya chakra
all right, and you are doing the exercise

00:51:02.809 --> 00:51:09.489
of this chakra you will spoil this as well
as spoil this.

00:51:09.489 --> 00:51:12.579
There's no logic, there's no understanding,
nothing.

00:51:12.579 --> 00:51:17.869
You see this is just physical exercises because
people want to become actors and actresses

00:51:17.869 --> 00:51:18.910
I think.

00:51:18.910 --> 00:51:20.979
(Seeker speaks to Mother.

00:51:20.979 --> 00:51:27.259
Mentions the eight limbs of yoga the whole
astanga going through the nearma and the asanas,

00:51:27.259 --> 00:51:31.219
prameara, pratchara to try to work toward
samadhi)

00:51:31.219 --> 00:51:39.130
All those things you see, no, no it does not,
it does not, it does not.

00:51:39.130 --> 00:51:44.200
That's the other way round you see, this is
the problem.

00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:51.099
You see what happens that, unless and until
you get your Realization you have no entry

00:51:51.099 --> 00:51:54.770
into yourself you don't know where you are
going.

00:51:54.770 --> 00:51:57.619
This will never work out.

00:51:57.619 --> 00:52:04.769
On the contrary, all those who have done Hatha
Yoga catch on their heart center very much,

00:52:04.769 --> 00:52:09.930
because the whole attention is on the body.

00:52:09.930 --> 00:52:16.130
Because the attention is on the body the left
heart catches.

00:52:16.130 --> 00:52:24.319
Just now I have been to one organization where
I met three of them.

00:52:24.319 --> 00:52:34.690
They all had their left side absolutely frozen,
so they said, "Mother what should we do?"

00:52:34.690 --> 00:52:39.750
I said, "You must sing the praise of God.

00:52:39.750 --> 00:52:44.690
Forget, you have become so dry like a bamboo
now, fill it up with the love of God."

00:52:44.690 --> 00:52:49.920
Forget it all your asanas and everything,
just like, you see, dried fishes.

00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.369
There's no emotions left.

00:52:51.369 --> 00:52:56.730
It's such an imbalance, ha and tha both the
things, they've not said only ha, ha is the

00:52:56.730 --> 00:53:05.059
surya nadi they said ha and tha.

00:53:05.059 --> 00:53:13.400
What are you doing about tha, nothing?

00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:22.930
So you are doing ha yoga, all right.

00:53:22.930 --> 00:53:32.710
You have to do Hatha Yoga but, without Ishwara
Pranitana (MAYBE Prathistana - SG), without

00:53:32.710 --> 00:53:46.779
Realization we also do, not that we don't
do, whatever is needed that we do.

00:53:46.779 --> 00:53:49.707
For example, now when I went there I told
them what should be given to a person who

00:53:49.707 --> 00:53:54.039
is suffering from mental diseases.

00:53:54.039 --> 00:54:10.079
He said, "All this for mental diseases, also
all these for egoistical people, also all

00:54:10.079 --> 00:54:21.869
these for liver patients, also all these for,
I mean it's horrible."

00:54:21.869 --> 00:54:37.249
I said, "How can that be, on the contrary
to a mental patient if you make him bend forward

00:54:37.249 --> 00:54:42.680
he'll suffer more, he must bend backwards.

00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:47.180
A person who is ego oriented should bend forward."

00:54:47.180 --> 00:54:57.289
They changed of course, I mean they're sensible
people as well as I'm concerned, they believe

00:54:57.289 --> 00:55:08.660
in Me, they think in India of course I'm accepted
as some sort of a, something like that.

00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:12.499
But you see these are little, little things
they don't know.

00:55:12.499 --> 00:55:16.720
Supposing a person is ego oriented, right-sided
person as we call it.

00:55:16.720 --> 00:55:21.019
Right-sided person if he tries to bend backwards
he'll become even worse.

00:55:21.019 --> 00:55:30.779
And a person who is a superego person, suffering
from mental troubles and all that has to,

00:55:30.779 --> 00:55:36.640
not to bend forward at all, he has to bend
backwards.

00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:45.809
Because they're two types of people, there
are actually three types as you know.

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:57.709
The people who are, I mean, in vulgar language
we can call it masochist and sadist but they

00:55:57.709 --> 00:56:05.420
are extreme cases, but I'm saying that style.

00:56:05.420 --> 00:56:09.980
We call them tamo gunis and rajo gunis.

00:56:09.980 --> 00:56:22.359
So the rajo gunis the sadists, if they become
more like this, God save the world, see the

00:56:22.359 --> 00:56:23.359
point?

00:56:23.359 --> 00:56:30.099
And the emotions are drained out of such people,
there no feelings left, no emotions, nothing,

00:56:30.099 --> 00:56:31.099
zero.

00:56:31.099 --> 00:56:39.230
I met one dentist who came and he said, "Mother
now I have become a sthitapragya."

00:56:39.230 --> 00:56:40.230
I said, "How?"

00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:41.550
"I have no feelings.

00:56:41.550 --> 00:56:45.410
Nothing happens to me.

00:56:45.410 --> 00:56:48.309
You see my child is sick I'm not bothered."

00:56:48.309 --> 00:56:50.520
What a nice man you are.

00:56:50.520 --> 00:56:51.989
"I have no feelings.

00:56:51.989 --> 00:56:56.369
My mother calls me I have no feelings.

00:56:56.369 --> 00:56:59.349
I am living somewhere alone."

00:56:59.349 --> 00:57:01.749
I said, "All right."

00:57:01.749 --> 00:57:08.119
I said, "Is that the way the saints have lived?

00:57:08.119 --> 00:57:16.979
They have been worried not only about their
people but about everyone."

00:57:16.979 --> 00:57:19.199
There's no love.

00:57:19.199 --> 00:57:25.849
There's no love in the modern yoga, no love.

00:57:25.849 --> 00:57:32.660
Is only the love of God, can be only felt
through Spirit.

00:57:32.660 --> 00:57:36.819
You have to have a balance.

00:57:36.819 --> 00:57:43.410
Is very one sided, extremely one sided.

00:57:43.410 --> 00:57:54.500
One side is those who are singing the devotional
songs and the other side are (inaudible).

00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:59.089
Both are equally mad I tell you.

00:57:59.089 --> 00:58:02.239
Both can be equally mad.

00:58:02.239 --> 00:58:10.999
Come to the balance, again you have to come
to the balance, otherwise you cannot enjoy

00:58:10.999 --> 00:58:11.999
Sahaja Yoga.

00:58:11.999 --> 00:58:14.460
Sahaja Yoga is an enjoyment, enjoyment of
your balance, of the beauty of God's love,

00:58:14.460 --> 00:58:15.460
and the truth of His work.

00:58:15.460 --> 00:58:16.460
Everything has to be enjoyed, all right.

00:58:16.460 --> 00:58:17.460
You just work it out.

00:58:17.460 --> 00:58:18.759
Shri Mataji: Have you done yoga very much?

00:58:18.759 --> 00:58:19.759
Seeker: Sorry?

00:58:19.759 --> 00:58:23.619
Shri Mataji: Have you done lot of yoga?

00:58:23.619 --> 00:58:24.819
Seeker: Reasonable.

00:58:24.819 --> 00:58:29.950
I do follow the Buddhist practice which is
based upon...

00:58:29.950 --> 00:58:31.790
Shri Mataji: Now Buddhist also!

00:58:31.790 --> 00:58:35.119
Now I'll tell you about Buddhism, all right?

00:58:35.119 --> 00:58:37.309
What are Buddhists doing?

00:58:37.309 --> 00:58:41.140
Is true about everyone Christians, Hindus,
everybody.

00:58:41.140 --> 00:58:46.839
Just because you asked about Buddhist I must
tell you.

00:58:46.839 --> 00:58:54.099
Where is Buddha placed within us do they know?

00:58:54.099 --> 00:58:55.180
Where is Buddha?

00:58:55.180 --> 00:58:59.140
Buddha is placed within us at a point...
Seeker: Well, yes...

00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:08.979
Shri Mataji: And what does He control within
us?

00:59:08.979 --> 00:59:11.339
We have to know this knowledge of the roots.

00:59:11.339 --> 00:59:22.039
Unless and until you know the knowledge of
the roots how will you know about the tree?

00:59:22.039 --> 00:59:30.259
You cannot treat the tree on its leaves or
branches you have to go to the roots.

00:59:30.259 --> 00:59:32.920
And first you find out the roots within.

00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:40.089
Buddhism is so superficial now, that I Myself
amazed and Buddha must be thinking, oh God

00:59:40.089 --> 00:59:42.759
from where it has come.

00:59:42.759 --> 00:59:45.420
He says "Buddham, Sharanam, Gachami."

00:59:45.420 --> 00:59:47.029
What is Buddha?

00:59:47.029 --> 00:59:48.910
Is an enlightened soul?

00:59:48.910 --> 00:59:53.170
Buddham means the one who is enlightened.

00:59:53.170 --> 00:59:58.040
"Sangham sharanam gachami" means to the collective
being.

00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.980
Sangham means the collective being.

01:00:00.980 --> 01:00:03.470
"Dhamam sharanam gachami."

01:00:03.470 --> 01:00:08.619
Dhamam is the balance within you.

01:00:08.619 --> 01:00:15.469
How many Buddhists know about it?

01:00:15.469 --> 01:00:17.460
They don't know even where Buddha is sitting
on their heads.

01:00:17.460 --> 01:00:25.940
And what I find most of the Buddhists that
their center of Buddha is finished.

01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:29.789
Buddha has disappeared from them once for
all.

01:00:29.789 --> 01:00:37.349
He controls our ego, and he's settled down
here on the head on the left hand side.

01:00:37.349 --> 01:00:38.349
We can prove it on Kundalini.

01:00:38.349 --> 01:00:45.099
Supposing somebody is following Buddha immediately
people will know that you are a Buddhist because

01:00:45.099 --> 01:00:47.490
there's a catch here.

01:00:47.490 --> 01:00:56.510
And then some methods are there to awaken
Him, if you awaken Him your Kundalini will

01:00:56.510 --> 01:01:01.569
rise otherwise it won't, all right?

01:01:01.569 --> 01:01:08.010
So you must know the knowledge of the roots.

01:01:08.010 --> 01:01:11.739
We should not just depend on Budhhism or any
"ism."

01:01:11.739 --> 01:01:13.239
That's what I'm saying.

01:01:13.239 --> 01:01:25.380
Seeker: Yes, it's just the thing You said
in the beginning, I mean I agree...

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:43.890
Shri Mataji: Yes, you see we have to have
the complete integrated knowledge of the roots,

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:47.339
which nourishes, isn't it?

01:01:47.339 --> 01:01:59.680
Seeker ask the question:- Are you advocating
a system or a practice to get closer to these

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:00.680
roots?

01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:07.690
Shri Mataji: No, no, no, no there is no system
about this.

01:02:07.690 --> 01:02:12.619
There is no system no practice, no courses.

01:02:12.619 --> 01:02:14.549
Actually it is spontaneous.

01:02:14.549 --> 01:02:15.759
I'm talking of your evolution.

01:02:15.759 --> 01:02:17.220
Your evolution comes through a living force
of the living God.

01:02:17.220 --> 01:02:21.359
You cannot have a course in that, can you
have?

01:02:21.359 --> 01:02:24.369
How do you sprout a seed?

01:02:24.369 --> 01:02:32.880
You have to just put it in the Mother Earth
it sprouts by itself, is built in.

01:02:32.880 --> 01:02:40.160
In the same way within you it's built in and
it sprouts, that's all.

01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:42.279
There's no course.

01:02:42.279 --> 01:02:48.410
Maybe you may not get it today you'll get
it tomorrow, some seeds sprout faster.

01:02:48.410 --> 01:03:13.619
Seeker makes a comment: I see the Buddhist
tradition as growing out of a yogic insight.

01:03:13.619 --> 01:03:27.160
No, no, no, you are sadly mistaken about Buddhism.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:34.980
The trouble is with the western people they're
so fed up with Christianity that they think

01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:35.980
Buddhism is going to solve the problem.

01:03:35.980 --> 01:03:37.089
They are just like any other Christian church,
take it from Me.

01:03:37.089 --> 01:03:39.619
All these lamas should be hanged by the nearest
tree, I tell you.

01:03:39.619 --> 01:03:41.910
Horrible people they are, horrible.

01:03:41.910 --> 01:03:44.189
You should see their vibrations.

01:03:44.189 --> 01:03:52.460
You know this Dalai Lama when they're sitting
next to Me, I was invited to the Prime Minister's

01:03:52.460 --> 01:03:54.200
place, I just couldn't bear him.

01:03:54.200 --> 01:04:11.789
And the Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri
himself was a realized soul and he could feel

01:04:11.789 --> 01:04:13.829
it and he said, "Is he very hot?"

01:04:13.829 --> 01:04:14.829
I said, "Yes."

01:04:14.829 --> 01:04:16.979
Is in Hindi he said, "He's an extremely hot
fellow."

01:04:16.979 --> 01:04:23.789
He said, "All right, you get on the other
side," he made the foreign minister sit here.

01:04:23.789 --> 01:04:29.219
You won't understand, just now you don't understand.

01:04:29.219 --> 01:04:31.299
Even a little child who is a realized soul
will understand, but you won't because you're

01:04:31.299 --> 01:04:33.269
not yet realized, this is the point.

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:36.640
The difference is you are mentally understanding.

01:04:36.640 --> 01:05:01.559
I have a grand daughter she was hardly five
years of age when My daughter and the son-in-law

01:05:01.559 --> 01:05:02.859
went to Ladakh, it's an interesting story.

01:05:02.859 --> 01:05:04.839
And there was a lama sitting you see like
this, and everybody was touching his feet.

01:05:04.839 --> 01:05:06.390
This little child was a realized soul, she
couldn't bear it any more, when the father

01:05:06.390 --> 01:05:10.309
went and touched his foot she just stood back
and she said, "What do you mean by shaving

01:05:10.309 --> 01:05:16.400
your head and wearing this big stuff you think
you are a realized soul?

01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:19.849
Why are you making everybody touch your feet?"

01:05:19.849 --> 01:05:21.579
Just she stood up.

01:05:21.579 --> 01:05:25.890
And My son-in-law felt quite embarrassed and
he told that he's not even a realized soul

01:05:25.890 --> 01:05:26.890
why do you touch his feet.

01:05:26.890 --> 01:05:27.890
You won't understand, even a little child
will understand, you won't understand.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:29.079
Realized soul is a person who can feel it.

01:05:29.079 --> 01:05:33.180
This is what Buddha has said, that's the traditional
thing, he has said, "First of all seek yourself."

01:05:33.180 --> 01:05:34.940
Buddha didn't talk about God.

01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:39.890
Why, because he thought if you talk about
God again another religion will start.

01:05:39.890 --> 01:05:44.969
He just said first of all, as I say, "First
of all seek yourself, get your Self-Realization.

01:05:44.969 --> 01:05:46.229
Nothing else but get your Realization."

01:05:46.229 --> 01:05:47.229
All right that's it.

01:05:47.229 --> 01:05:48.949
So better have it, better have it.

01:05:48.949 --> 01:05:49.949
You see you have Buddhism there's nothing
like "ism" about Buddha these people are mental.

01:05:49.949 --> 01:05:50.949
To have it means to get Realization.

01:05:50.949 --> 01:05:51.949
What tradition are they following, carrying
that ring like this, like that, mad kip (sic)

01:05:51.949 --> 01:05:52.949
people, horrible.

01:05:52.949 --> 01:05:53.949
Is that what Buddha did?

01:05:53.949 --> 01:05:54.949
He sought His Realization.

01:05:54.949 --> 01:05:55.949
He didn't do all these nonsensical things
these lamas.

01:05:55.949 --> 01:05:56.949
And they even beat people and do all kinds
of things, horrible cruel people.

01:05:56.949 --> 01:05:57.949
Thank God there out of that Lhasa.

01:05:57.949 --> 01:05:58.949
You should see the Tibetans now they're sitting
on our heads like parasites in India and we

01:05:58.949 --> 01:05:59.949
had a parliament question on them.

01:05:59.949 --> 01:06:00.949
You see they look very attractive because
you are fed up with your Christianity, that's

01:06:00.949 --> 01:06:01.949
what.

01:06:01.949 --> 01:06:02.949
Don't believe in all these please whether
they're Hindus, Christians or Muslim, all

01:06:02.949 --> 01:06:03.949
are just the same.

01:06:03.949 --> 01:06:04.949
There's no difference.

01:06:04.949 --> 01:06:05.949
You become the realized soul first of all.

01:06:05.949 --> 01:06:06.949
You have to be the Buddha, all right, that's
what I am saying as a Mother.

01:06:06.949 --> 01:06:07.949
And then they started another one Shambhala
business you see.

01:06:07.949 --> 01:06:08.949
This is another new thing.

01:06:08.949 --> 01:06:09.949
Taking everybody to Gobi Desert to get samadhi.

01:06:09.949 --> 01:06:10.949
Walk in that Gobi Desert even one mile you'll
get a samadhi permanently.

01:06:10.949 --> 01:06:11.949
[laughter] You can't even get a glass of water
there to drink, My child.

01:06:11.949 --> 01:06:12.949
What things they are preaching, you don't
know, all nonsense.

01:06:12.949 --> 01:06:13.949
In Spain some Spanish people have started
this nonsense.

01:06:13.949 --> 01:06:14.949
They are recruiting people to go to Gobi Desert.

01:06:14.949 --> 01:06:15.949
I mean what is going to happen to them?

01:06:15.949 --> 01:06:16.949
Think of the Gobi Desert, is one of the worst
deserts of the world.

01:06:16.949 --> 01:06:17.949
Can you imagine going to a desert, how will
you reach God?

01:06:17.949 --> 01:06:18.949
You have to seek Him within yourself.

01:06:18.949 --> 01:06:19.949
He's within, all right?

01:06:19.949 --> 01:06:20.949
Question from seeker:- Mother please tell
us about the dangers of mis-using mantras

01:06:20.949 --> 01:06:21.949
by religious sects.

01:06:21.949 --> 01:06:22.949
Shri Mataji: Mantras, all right, dangers of
mantras?

01:06:22.949 --> 01:06:23.949
You see mantra is a thing by which you awaken
the Deity within you.

01:06:23.949 --> 01:06:24.949
The Deity, which is on this chakra.

01:06:24.949 --> 01:06:25.949
Now here the chakras and we have deities.

01:06:25.949 --> 01:06:26.949
On these we have to awaken the Deities.

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:27.949
So, a person who is awakened himself can only
tell you what mantra to be said, isn't it,

01:06:27.949 --> 01:06:28.949
a simple thing as that?

01:06:28.949 --> 01:06:29.949
The one who has no eyes, what can he tell
to another blind person?

01:06:29.949 --> 01:06:30.949
So first an enlightened soul, who knows about
chakras can only tell you what chakras are

01:06:30.949 --> 01:06:31.949
catching within you.

01:06:31.949 --> 01:06:32.949
But the Kundalini should solve.

01:06:32.949 --> 01:06:33.949
Supposing you are just now caught in your
Nabhi chakra and I tell you that you say the

01:06:33.949 --> 01:06:34.949
mantra.

01:06:34.949 --> 01:06:35.949
Not that you, but the realized soul should
say the mantra and awaken that.

01:06:35.949 --> 01:06:36.949
Maybe the Kundalini has gone there, so from
there you have to come here.

01:06:36.949 --> 01:06:37.949
You have to see the movement of the Kundalini.

01:06:37.949 --> 01:06:38.949
Like a car is going now, very simple, the
car is going so we come to a toll gate, all

01:06:38.949 --> 01:06:39.949
right.

01:06:39.949 --> 01:06:40.949
There we have to pay the toll.

01:06:40.949 --> 01:06:41.949
But where the car is going, and then there
is a toll gate you pay there to a particular

01:06:41.949 --> 01:06:42.949
toll gate, isn't it?

01:06:42.949 --> 01:06:43.949
Like when you are going you see -

01:06:43.949 --> 01:06:44.949
(Shri Mataji speaks aside: I've given up tea.

01:06:44.949 --> 01:06:45.949
I have, just given up.

01:06:45.949 --> 01:06:46.949
Just take it.

01:06:46.949 --> 01:06:47.949
Sixty years I thought I have drunk too much
of tea.

01:06:47.949 --> 01:06:48.949
But that doesn't mean you should give up.

01:06:48.949 --> 01:06:49.949
[laughter])

01:06:49.949 --> 01:06:50.949
So you see the thing is the movement of the
Kundalini will only tell you which chakra

01:06:50.949 --> 01:06:52.229
is catching, all right, otherwise you will
not know.

01:06:52.229 --> 01:06:55.029
Unless until you move the car, before that,
how will you know where the car is going to

01:06:55.029 --> 01:06:56.029
get the toll.

01:06:56.029 --> 01:06:59.709
Can you pay it before the car starts?

01:06:59.709 --> 01:07:06.309
So what happens, if they give you a mantra
mostly people don't know what they're doing.

01:07:06.309 --> 01:07:08.650
You see it is a big enterprise.

01:07:08.650 --> 01:07:12.039
Giving mantras is a very big enterprise.

01:07:12.039 --> 01:07:18.009
Like they have given mantras, which I was
amazed to hear, if you tell some Indians,

01:07:18.009 --> 01:07:19.689
they'll be laughing at you.

01:07:19.689 --> 01:07:25.400
What they say is a great secret, and the mantras
they gave was, one was I heard, was "tinga"

01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:26.400
means like this you show to someone you see
this is "tinga", in Hindi language.

01:07:26.400 --> 01:07:27.400
There is nothing like "ing" in Sanskrit Language.

01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:28.459
Another mantra I heard was "inga".

01:07:28.459 --> 01:07:51.479
"Inga" means the tail of the, the sting of
a scorpion, can you imagine that could be

01:07:51.479 --> 01:07:53.839
it.

01:07:53.839 --> 01:08:00.999
And then, where is the director of the flying
squad, is he there?

01:08:00.999 --> 01:08:04.160
He's hiding there at the back.

01:08:04.160 --> 01:08:09.950
Now what is the mantra for they gave you for
flying?

01:08:09.950 --> 01:08:11.009
What tubes?

01:08:11.009 --> 01:08:12.009
Who is there?

01:08:12.009 --> 01:08:13.009
Come along where is he?

01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:14.009
Yogi: "Bronchial tubes, Mother."

01:08:14.009 --> 01:08:15.009
Shri Mataji: Bronchial tubes.

01:08:15.009 --> 01:08:16.009
Bronchial tubes, bronchial tubes, they paid
six thousand pounds for getting that mantra

01:08:16.009 --> 01:08:17.009
for you.

01:08:17.009 --> 01:08:18.009
[laughter] Just imagine this bronchial tube
is one of them.

01:08:18.009 --> 01:08:19.009
Then they'll give a mantra of Rama.

01:08:19.009 --> 01:08:20.009
Take a more sensible thing, they might give
a mantra of Rama.

01:08:20.009 --> 01:08:21.009
But Rama where does He exist?

01:08:21.009 --> 01:08:22.009
Supposing I want to give a mantra of Buddha,
for example.

01:08:22.009 --> 01:08:23.009
Where is Buddha?

01:08:23.009 --> 01:08:24.009
Are you catching on Buddha or not, is the
main point.

01:08:24.009 --> 01:08:25.009
Where are you catching?

01:08:25.009 --> 01:08:26.009
Where is Rama?

01:08:26.009 --> 01:08:27.009
Rama resides in what part?

01:08:27.009 --> 01:08:28.009
Is it necessary to give this mantra or not?

01:08:28.009 --> 01:08:29.009
They don't know anything, no knowledge of
any kind just at random.

01:08:29.009 --> 01:08:30.009
At the age of six years to twenty years give
the mantra what is it, "pinga" then another

01:08:30.009 --> 01:08:31.009
one "tinga", another "ringa", according to
the age, not according to the Kundalin where

01:08:31.009 --> 01:08:32.009
it is.

01:08:32.009 --> 01:08:33.009
Now what is the danger of that, that's the
main point is.

01:08:33.009 --> 01:08:34.009
That supposing they give you a name of Rama,
they are not awakened people they are not

01:08:34.009 --> 01:08:35.009
connected with God, they are not authorized.

01:08:35.009 --> 01:08:36.009
Now you go on saying Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama,
Rama, Rama, Rama, Rama like that, you see.

01:08:36.009 --> 01:08:37.009
The other way round you say mara, mara means
I'm dead, I'm dead I'm dead.

01:08:37.009 --> 01:08:38.009
So you go on saying a mantra Rama, Rama, Rama,
now what happens that you are not connected

01:08:38.009 --> 01:08:39.009
with Rama at all, because you are not a realized
soul, neither the guru, the one who has taken

01:08:39.009 --> 01:08:40.009
three thousand pounds for giving you this
Rama mantra, is a realized soul.

01:08:40.009 --> 01:08:41.009
So when you are shouting like that Rama, Rama,
Rama, who will come to your help will be somebody

01:08:41.009 --> 01:08:42.009
dead as Mr. Rama somewhere.

01:08:42.009 --> 01:08:43.009
He will come to your help and he'll possess
you.

01:08:43.009 --> 01:08:44.009
With that you may start thinking because you
get an added personality and suddenly you

01:08:44.009 --> 01:08:45.009
feel you see you get more powers so called.

01:08:45.009 --> 01:08:46.009
Like Gauguin if you go on saying Gauguin,
Gauguin, Gauguin he might enter into you.

01:08:46.009 --> 01:08:47.009
You might start painting something and after
that finished you have no energy left because

01:08:47.009 --> 01:08:48.009
one horse is riding two men.

01:08:48.009 --> 01:08:49.009
But the worse thing that happens to you by
saying mantra is that you develop a terrible

01:08:49.009 --> 01:08:50.009
dent in this very important center called
Vishuddhi, specially the left Vishuddhi.

01:08:50.009 --> 01:08:51.009
And then they are frightened.

01:08:51.009 --> 01:08:52.009
If you ask them, "What is your mantra?"

01:08:52.009 --> 01:08:53.009
"Mother I won't tell you."

01:08:53.009 --> 01:08:54.009
"Why?"

01:08:54.009 --> 01:08:55.009
"No that is not to be told."

01:08:55.009 --> 01:08:56.009
All secrets in God's vision, in God's realm
there should be no secret at all, everything

01:08:56.009 --> 01:08:57.009
should be known, everybody should know what
is what.

01:08:57.009 --> 01:08:58.009
Why should there be any secrets, I can't understand.

01:08:58.009 --> 01:08:59.009
For example everybody will know those who
are realized souls, where you are catching,

01:08:59.009 --> 01:09:00.009
what is your chakra, they'll tell you.

01:09:00.009 --> 01:09:01.009
Everybody will say the same.

01:09:01.009 --> 01:09:02.009
Like one day one gentleman came he said, "Why
are they all coming and asking me 'How is

01:09:02.009 --> 01:09:03.009
your father?'"

01:09:03.009 --> 01:09:04.009
I said, "Because your Rama's chakra is catching."

01:09:04.009 --> 01:09:05.009
That's exactly the mantra you will take.

01:09:05.009 --> 01:09:06.009
So your chakra is caught, that is the one
that the name they give you because you're

01:09:06.009 --> 01:09:07.009
insulting the deity and this Vishuddhi chakra,
by which you say also is caught up, and from

01:09:07.009 --> 01:09:08.009
there it goes as guilt to the left.

01:09:08.009 --> 01:09:09.009
If you should try to correct a person it acts
as a guilt and he gets a problem on the left

01:09:09.009 --> 01:09:10.009
hand side Vishuddhi which is a very, very
big problem.

01:09:10.009 --> 01:09:11.009
Seeker: Japanese religious sect gives Buddhist
mantra called Nam-myoho-renge-kyo.

01:09:11.009 --> 01:09:12.009
)

01:09:12.009 --> 01:09:13.009
Shri Mataji: Nam-myoho-renge-kyo, I know.

01:09:13.009 --> 01:09:14.009
You see Nam-myoho-renge-kyo is a great thing,
but not by these Japanese people.

01:09:14.009 --> 01:09:15.009
Japanese less said the better.

01:09:15.009 --> 01:09:16.009
I met the person called, his name I have forgotten.

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:17.009
He was the head of the Zen system.

01:09:17.009 --> 01:09:18.009
Now see Zen is Sahaja Yoga.

01:09:18.009 --> 01:09:19.009
To be realized is to be Zen.

01:09:19.009 --> 01:09:20.009
But this fellow had a frozen Kundalini just
like that there just sitting settled down.

01:09:20.009 --> 01:09:21.009
So I told him, "Sir with very humble understanding
I would like to say, that are you really a

01:09:21.009 --> 01:09:22.009
Zen?"

01:09:22.009 --> 01:09:23.009
He said, "I'm teaching Zen, but I'm not."

01:09:23.009 --> 01:09:24.009
I said, "Why?"

01:09:24.009 --> 01:09:25.009
He said, "Altogether from the sixth century
till today, only up to the eight century we

01:09:25.009 --> 01:09:26.009
had Prashapas [MAYBE Prashapas or Pashyapas
or Kashyapas - SG] means realized souls."

01:09:26.009 --> 01:09:27.009
Only till the eighth century and after that
what followed was this kind of people who

01:09:27.009 --> 01:09:28.009
had the Kundalini just settled down there.

01:09:28.009 --> 01:09:29.009
But at least he was honest.

01:09:29.009 --> 01:09:30.009
And he was suffering from a horrible disease
for which he came to Me.

01:09:30.009 --> 01:09:31.009
So I said, "At least you do not propagate
now Zen, because you are not a Zen."

01:09:31.009 --> 01:09:32.009
You are a Christian, are you?

01:09:32.009 --> 01:09:33.009
Ask anyone who is he.

01:09:33.009 --> 01:09:34.009
This artificial baptism is not Christianity.

01:09:34.009 --> 01:09:35.009
Is the real baptism, raising of the Kundalini.

01:09:35.009 --> 01:09:36.009
Is the Kundalini piercing through?

01:09:36.009 --> 01:09:37.009
Are you a muslim?

01:09:37.009 --> 01:09:38.009
You are not because you are not a pir, you
are to be a realized soul first.

01:09:38.009 --> 01:09:39.009
So imagine all these people who are teaching
all these things are not authorized at all.

01:09:39.009 --> 01:09:40.009
But they'll come round, I'm sure.

01:09:40.009 --> 01:09:41.009
Seeker asks a question: I was interested in
Your comment when You said Nam-myoho-renge-kyo

01:09:41.009 --> 01:09:42.009
is fine but not any Japanese...

01:09:42.009 --> 01:09:43.009
Shri Mataji: You see now I'll tell you.

01:09:43.009 --> 01:09:44.009
It is very simple to understand, you understand
one point which you are missing all the time.

01:09:44.009 --> 01:09:45.009
Is this that supposing there is a constable
standing there and he says, "Go this way,"

01:09:45.009 --> 01:09:46.009
all right, we have to obey him otherwise you'll
end in jail he's authorized, isn't it?

01:09:46.009 --> 01:09:47.009
But supposing I go and stand there and say,
"Go this way," they'll put Me in jail.

01:09:47.009 --> 01:09:48.009
They have no authority from God to do it because
they are not realized souls.

01:09:48.009 --> 01:09:49.009
The same mantra becomes a great mantra when
it comes from an authorized person from God.

01:09:49.009 --> 01:09:50.009
But the same mantra becomes a sinful thing
when it comes from a person who is not authorized,

01:09:50.009 --> 01:09:51.009
who's just commercialized it.

01:09:51.009 --> 01:09:52.009
[Seeker interrupts] Is it gone into your head
what I told you, that you are to be authorized

01:09:52.009 --> 01:09:53.009
by God?

01:09:53.009 --> 01:09:54.009
That is you should be self-realized.

01:09:54.009 --> 01:09:55.009
If you are not self-realized you have no right
to give any mantras or anything, do you follow

01:09:55.009 --> 01:09:56.009
this point, simple point.

01:09:56.009 --> 01:09:57.009
Seeker: Sure.

01:09:57.009 --> 01:09:58.009
Shri Mataji: Now that's all.

01:09:58.009 --> 01:09:59.009
So you get your Realization, that's important,
which you should.

01:09:59.009 --> 01:10:00.009
But I don't know how it works out, you see
that is not My guarantee.

01:10:00.009 --> 01:10:01.009
If it works out well and good, may not work
out today.

01:10:01.009 --> 01:10:02.009
So better put attention to that, it's important.

01:10:02.009 --> 01:10:03.009
May God Bless you.

01:10:03.009 --> 01:10:04.009
Is there any other question now?

01:10:04.009 --> 01:10:05.009
Put attention to that, that is important.

01:10:05.009 --> 01:10:06.009
But one thing more, when you follow them you
never ask questions.

01:10:06.009 --> 01:10:07.009
I had one lady from a lama she came down from
Norway, she was horrid, absolutely horrid.

01:10:07.009 --> 01:10:08.009
Her vibrations were, what was her name Gavin?

01:10:08.009 --> 01:10:09.009
Gavin: Pia

01:10:09.009 --> 01:10:10.009
Shri Mataji: Pia.

01:10:10.009 --> 01:10:11.009
She came to My house I said, "Baba!

01:10:11.009 --> 01:10:12.009
How to raise her Kundalini, baba, dreadful."

01:10:12.009 --> 01:10:13.009
And she was thinking no end of herself and
arguing, arguing with Me throughout, and all

01:10:13.009 --> 01:10:14.009
that.

01:10:14.009 --> 01:10:15.009
I said, "How did you happen," I mean she has
been to this lama.

01:10:15.009 --> 01:10:16.009
I said, "What happened?"

01:10:16.009 --> 01:10:17.009
She said, "No, he wrote to us that I can't
live in an ordinary house you have to make

01:10:17.009 --> 01:10:18.009
a marble floor.

01:10:18.009 --> 01:10:19.009
So first we all starved ourselves, within
one year we collected money made a marble

01:10:19.009 --> 01:10:20.009
floor for the fellow.

01:10:20.009 --> 01:10:21.009
So he came and was sitting on the seventh
step and we were first one year we had to

01:10:21.009 --> 01:10:22.009
just go and bow to him just like this."

01:10:22.009 --> 01:10:23.009
One thousand and one time can you imagine
everyday and "I've done that course."

01:10:23.009 --> 01:10:24.009
But I said, "Didn't you argue with him?"

01:10:24.009 --> 01:10:25.009
She said, "No."

01:10:25.009 --> 01:10:26.009
Then I said, "Why are you arguing with Me?"

01:10:26.009 --> 01:10:27.009
Of course I like that you argue because that
shows you are free to argue, I've not mesmerized

01:10:27.009 --> 01:10:28.009
you, but must see the sense.

01:10:28.009 --> 01:10:29.009
How do we accept Buddha, let's see.

01:10:29.009 --> 01:10:30.009
Have you seen Buddha?

01:10:30.009 --> 01:10:31.009
Have you met him?

01:10:31.009 --> 01:10:32.009
Have you met anybody who is a Buddhist who
says he can give Realization?

01:10:32.009 --> 01:10:33.009
But then why are we the pleaders of Buddha
whom we have never seen, who has gone away,

01:10:33.009 --> 01:10:34.009
we don't know anything about Him.

01:10:34.009 --> 01:10:35.009
Why?

01:10:35.009 --> 01:10:36.009
Because I am living He is not.

01:10:36.009 --> 01:10:37.009
When He was living there were people who were
asking about other people.

01:10:37.009 --> 01:10:38.009
So better be in the present and get it your
Realization, all right, that's what it is.

01:10:38.009 --> 01:10:39.009
That's what happened with Buddha he couldn't
give Realization to anyone whatsoever.

01:10:39.009 --> 01:10:40.009
Sariputa, Mogallana, all were wasted people.

01:10:40.009 --> 01:10:41.009
Same with Christ.

01:10:41.009 --> 01:10:42.009
Because when Krishna came they said, "What
about Rama?"

01:10:42.009 --> 01:10:43.009
When Rama came they said, "What about Dattatreya?"

01:10:43.009 --> 01:10:44.009
But where is Dattatreya now?

01:10:44.009 --> 01:10:45.009
Rama is standing here why not get it from
Him.

01:10:45.009 --> 01:10:46.009
So everybody failed.

01:10:46.009 --> 01:10:47.009
They said, "They are talking about the past
only."

01:10:47.009 --> 01:10:48.009
What about the present?

01:10:48.009 --> 01:10:49.009
You are sitting before Me, I am sitting before
you, have your Realization.

01:10:49.009 --> 01:10:50.009
Why argue about it?

01:10:50.009 --> 01:10:51.009
If there's a diamond and if I say you can
have it free will you argue?

01:10:51.009 --> 01:10:52.009
You understand diamond better than our Spirit.

01:10:52.009 --> 01:10:53.009
Always we did that but this time better not
miss it.

01:10:53.009 --> 01:10:54.009
I'm telling you better have your Realization,
it's important.

01:10:54.009 --> 01:10:55.009
Of course Buddha plays a very big role within
us but first get your Spirit otherwise it

01:10:55.009 --> 01:10:56.009
has no authority.

01:10:56.009 --> 01:10:57.009
The knowledge of Buddha has no authority within
you unless and until you become the Buddha

01:10:57.009 --> 01:10:58.009
yourself.

01:10:58.009 --> 01:10:59.009
All right, now let's have it.

01:10:59.009 --> 01:11:00.009
At the end of it I would request you to have
your Realization.

01:11:00.009 --> 01:11:01.009
Put your hands like this towards Me just like
this.

01:11:01.009 --> 01:11:02.009
Better now, relaxed, all right, nice.

01:11:02.009 --> 01:11:03.009
Put your hands like this.

01:11:03.009 --> 01:11:04.009
It works, it works that's the point is, it
should work, isn't it?

01:11:04.009 --> 01:11:05.009
Now close your eyes, please.

01:11:05.009 --> 01:11:06.009
Just close your eyes, you have to keep your
eyes shut that's important because when the

01:11:06.009 --> 01:11:07.009
Kundalini rises above the Agnya chakra if
your eyes are not closed it will fall down,

01:11:07.009 --> 01:11:08.009
so please close your eyes.

01:11:08.009 --> 01:11:09.009
There's no mesmerism that's why you have to
close your eyes.

01:11:09.009 --> 01:11:10.009
Just keep your eyes shut.

01:11:10.009 --> 01:11:11.009
[Shri Mataji speaks aside: Take the baby out,
please.]

01:11:11.009 --> 01:11:12.009
Just sit comfortably don't move, don't make
any gestures nothing, nothing outward.

01:11:12.009 --> 01:11:13.009
You have to be inside, it will work out inside.

01:11:13.009 --> 01:11:14.009
Nothing should work out outside.

01:11:14.009 --> 01:11:15.009
Just keep quiet.

01:11:15.009 --> 01:11:16.009
Just put your hand towards Me.

01:11:16.009 --> 01:11:17.009
Whatever has to work out will work out inside,
not outside.

01:11:17.009 --> 01:11:18.009
Don't open your eyes but don't fix your attention
anywhere, keep it loose, just keep it loose,

01:11:18.009 --> 01:11:19.009
don't fix it at a point, please.

01:11:19.009 --> 01:11:20.009
Don't try to fix it at - some people are fixing
it at the point what we call the Agnya chakra

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:21.009
or anything.

01:11:21.009 --> 01:11:22.009
At the most you can put your attention on
top of your head.

01:11:22.009 --> 01:11:23.009
But don't try to fix it anywhere keep it loose,
absolutely loose.

01:11:23.009 --> 01:11:24.009
Now with your right hand, which is the hand
of your creativity or the action power, you

01:11:24.009 --> 01:11:25.009
have to use the right hand to express your
action and the left hand is a desire.

01:11:25.009 --> 01:11:26.009
So you have to put the left hand towards Me
for the desire but don't open your eyes, just

01:11:26.009 --> 01:11:27.009
on the lap you can keep it comfortably as
it is and you have to just move your right

01:11:27.009 --> 01:11:28.009
hand but keep the fingers straight.

01:11:28.009 --> 01:11:29.009
Straight fingers toward Me and move the right
hand as I tell you.

01:11:29.009 --> 01:11:30.009
No, on the lap left hand on the lap and the
right hand I'll tell you how to move it.

01:11:30.009 --> 01:11:31.009
Now put the right hand, no left hand toward
Me.

01:11:31.009 --> 01:11:32.009
Sahaja Yogis should see left hand towards
Me now move the right hand.

01:11:32.009 --> 01:11:33.009
Left hand on your lap comfortably, please
put left hand on your lap.

01:11:33.009 --> 01:11:34.009
Left hand on your lap, yes very comfortably.

01:11:34.009 --> 01:11:35.009
Now the right hand you have to put it on your
heart.

01:11:35.009 --> 01:11:36.009
Heart where resides your Spirit.

01:11:36.009 --> 01:11:37.009
Now in your heart you have to ask a question
to Me, "Mother am I the Spirit?"

01:11:37.009 --> 01:11:38.009
Just put it on the right hand side.

01:11:38.009 --> 01:11:39.009
Those who are very much on the left but actually
it is on the left hand side is the heart.

01:11:39.009 --> 01:11:40.009
You see those who are putting it too much
toward the left should put it at the proper

01:11:40.009 --> 01:11:41.009
place of your heart is on the left hand side.

01:11:41.009 --> 01:11:42.009
Now press it with your fingers.

01:11:42.009 --> 01:11:43.009
And just ask a question, "Mother am I the
spirit?"

01:11:43.009 --> 01:11:44.009
Say it thrice, ask a question with full confidence.

01:11:44.009 --> 01:11:45.009
Now please put this right hand, don't open
your eyes, on your stomach on the left hand

01:11:45.009 --> 01:11:46.009
side again.

01:11:46.009 --> 01:11:47.009
Lower part of the stomach and push it and
ask the question again to Me, "Mother am I

01:11:47.009 --> 01:11:48.009
my own Master, am I my own Guru?"

01:11:48.009 --> 01:11:49.009
Because you are, and this Spirit is your Guru.

01:11:49.009 --> 01:11:50.009
But when you are asking Me a question, "Mother
am I the Spirit?"

01:11:50.009 --> 01:11:51.009
you have to ask the second question, "Mother
am I my own Guru, am I my own Spirit?"

01:11:51.009 --> 01:11:52.009
Because the Spirit is the Guru, which is awakened
within you, when you get your Realization.

01:11:52.009 --> 01:11:53.009
So you have to say, "Mother am I my own Guru?"

01:11:53.009 --> 01:11:54.009
Say it ten times.

01:11:54.009 --> 01:11:55.009
Ask the question ten times.

01:11:55.009 --> 01:11:56.009
The times are according to the chakras.

01:11:56.009 --> 01:11:57.009
Keep the left hand the same way and now put
again the right hand on the heart.

01:11:57.009 --> 01:11:58.009
And now you assert with confidence that, "Mother
I am the Spirit," which you are.

01:11:58.009 --> 01:11:59.009
This you have to do it twelve times, twelve
times.

01:11:59.009 --> 01:12:00.009
Ten plus two, twelve times you have to say,
"Mother I am the Spirit."

01:12:00.009 --> 01:12:01.009
With confidence, with full confidence you
should say, "Mother I am the Spirit," full

01:12:01.009 --> 01:12:02.009
confidence.

01:12:02.009 --> 01:12:03.009
Now take this right hand across to the left
side of your neck, left side of your neck.

01:12:03.009 --> 01:12:04.009
Again was I said left Vishuddhi.

01:12:04.009 --> 01:12:05.009
Because the Spirit is immaculate, absolute,
it never does any mistakes so there is no

01:12:05.009 --> 01:12:06.009
question of feeling guilty.

01:12:06.009 --> 01:12:07.009
So you have to say sixteen times now that,
"Mother I am not guilty."

01:12:07.009 --> 01:12:08.009
Say it sixteen times, again with full confidence,
because we're talking about God Almighty who

01:12:08.009 --> 01:12:09.009
is the ocean of love, ocean of forgiveness,
ocean of compassion, sixteen times.

01:12:09.009 --> 01:12:10.009
Now again raise the left hand without opening
your eyes, to your forehead.

01:12:10.009 --> 01:12:11.009
Across your forehead, across your forehead,
and hold your forehead in your hand, right

01:12:11.009 --> 01:12:12.009
hand, left hand being towards Me.

01:12:12.009 --> 01:12:13.009
At this point is the Agnya chakra where you
have to say that, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:12:13.009 --> 01:12:14.009
Now some of you might say that I cannot forgive
is a very common thing people tell Me.

01:12:14.009 --> 01:12:15.009
But when you don't forgive what you are doing
is to play into the hands of people who try

01:12:15.009 --> 01:12:16.009
to harm you.

01:12:16.009 --> 01:12:17.009
So you just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:12:17.009 --> 01:12:18.009
With full understanding, without any reservation,
"I forgive everyone."

01:12:18.009 --> 01:12:19.009
Unless and until you forgive everyone how
can God forgive you?

01:12:19.009 --> 01:12:20.009
So let God forgive you for your mistakes what
you have done in your ignorance but don't

01:12:20.009 --> 01:12:21.009
feel guilty about it.

01:12:21.009 --> 01:12:22.009
Only you just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:12:22.009 --> 01:12:23.009
Now put this hand on top of your head, right
hand again where the soft bone was there when

01:12:23.009 --> 01:12:24.009
you were a child.

01:12:24.009 --> 01:12:25.009
Press it with your palm that portion and move
it in a clockwise manner.

01:12:25.009 --> 01:12:26.009
Press that palm and move it in a clockwise
manner.

01:12:26.009 --> 01:12:27.009
Now at this point I cannot cross your freedom.

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:28.009
It's your freedom, which I respect, you have
to say that you want ealization.

01:12:28.009 --> 01:12:29.009
So, here you have to say, "Mother we want
our realization.

01:12:29.009 --> 01:12:30.009
Please give us the Realization," otherwise
I cannot cross.

01:12:30.009 --> 01:12:31.009
So please say this seven times.

01:12:31.009 --> 01:12:32.009
Now you can raise your hand and see if there
is a cool breeze coming.

01:12:32.009 --> 01:12:33.009
Some people might be getting the heat coming
out of their heads.

01:12:33.009 --> 01:12:34.009
Raise it higher to see if there is a cool
breeze coming out.

01:12:34.009 --> 01:12:35.009
So many of you are still feeling guilty, is
a wrong thing.

01:12:35.009 --> 01:12:36.009
I've told you not to feel guilty.

01:12:36.009 --> 01:12:37.009
Just see if there is a cool breeze coming
out.

01:12:37.009 --> 01:12:38.009
Now you can take another hand, left hand and
see with your left hand.

01:12:38.009 --> 01:12:39.009
You can change over and see if there is a
cool breeze coming out.

01:12:39.009 --> 01:12:40.009
Not very much higher say about four inches
higher.

01:12:40.009 --> 01:12:41.009
You can change over another hand.

01:12:41.009 --> 01:12:42.009
You just see if this gentleman has got it,
Ruth see his.

01:12:42.009 --> 01:12:43.009
You got it, you feeling in the hand also,
not in the hand.

01:12:43.009 --> 01:12:44.009
He's got in the hand, you got it, it's very
subtle.

01:12:44.009 --> 01:12:45.009
It's a subtle thing.

01:12:45.009 --> 01:12:46.009
You are coming from a gross level to a subtler
place.

01:12:46.009 --> 01:12:47.009
All right, you have to do that left to the
right.

01:12:47.009 --> 01:12:48.009
Put your hands toward Me still, see the Sahaja
Yogis will help you now.

01:12:48.009 --> 01:12:49.009
Once you become Sahaja Yogis you have to help
others, all right.

01:12:49.009 --> 01:12:50.009
They know about your chakras.

01:12:50.009 --> 01:12:51.009
Is he all right?

01:12:51.009 --> 01:12:52.009
All right try to help Matha?

01:12:52.009 --> 01:12:53.009
See this gentleman, no.

01:12:53.009 --> 01:12:54.009
Left to the right, put him left to the right.

01:12:54.009 --> 01:12:55.009
Is he all right, all right?

01:12:55.009 --> 01:12:56.009
Not yet in the hand.

01:12:56.009 --> 01:12:57.009
You just watch Me without thinking.

01:12:57.009 --> 01:12:58.009
Can you do it?

01:12:58.009 --> 01:12:59.009
Got it, got it she said she's a Sahaja Yogini.

01:12:59.009 --> 01:13:00.009
What about him?

01:13:00.009 --> 01:13:01.009
Got it, see there.

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.009
(Shri Mataji speaks to someone in Marathi)

01:13:02.009 --> 01:13:03.009
See the new people please.

01:13:03.009 --> 01:13:04.009
No, no don't stop yet put (inaudible.)

01:13:04.009 --> 01:13:05.009
Put it left to the right.

01:13:05.009 --> 01:13:06.009
(Shri Mataji speaks to someone in Marathi)
Vishuddi , Nabhi (Shri Mataji speaks to someone

01:13:06.009 --> 01:13:06.011
in Marathi).
