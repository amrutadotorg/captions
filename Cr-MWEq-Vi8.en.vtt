00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:06.120
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.740
Yesterday I told you what is the truth

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.020
and that is what we are seeking today.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.420
In all our seeking

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.260
we may run after the mirage of money,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:37.540
of power, of friendship, of

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:46.100
carnal love but ultimately we have to know, that we are running after

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.800
the truth that is the Spirit.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:04.040
Yesterday I explained to you how the truth manifests itself

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:13.040
through your finger-tips and you can find out about any disease or any trouble

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:21.540
that is within you and without. Only thing you have to know how to work it out.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:32.700
When the realization takes place, we have to know

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.980
that a complete integration within take place.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:50.260
That is your physical, emotional, mental and spiritual being

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:57.340
become completely integrated. For example,

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:05.900
you think, you should start some sort of a work.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:13.140
That is what your mind tells you but

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.460
your heart tells you, "No, no, no, we should not do it."

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.380
Then physical being says, "No, no, no, you're very tired, how can you do it?"

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.300
And the spiritual being can say that, "I just don't know what is to be done."

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.200
But when you get your realization,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:47.040
you become very intense, very positive

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:54.280
and concentrate your mind very clearly on what is to be done.

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.940
Supposing, you have been doing something very wrong all your life

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.720
and you had no courage to get out of it,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:18.560
after realization you become very powerful personality within yourself

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.740
and then you do exactly what you have to do

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.580
which is physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually absolutely integrated and is correct.

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:40.400
So naturally, you become a very righteous person, very righteous person.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:47.000
The whole value system changes. Today the value system for people

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.480
orients, maybe, from money, from power, from some sort of a

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:02.700
human consideration. A person may think that, I should do

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.460
this thing because by doing this I'll get lot of money - maybe it's little cheating, doesn't matter.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:18.080
Maybe, he would like to do something just to gain

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.800
some sort of a power over other. He may dominate some people

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:33.640
or he may bear some domination because he has to.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:42.120
But after realization you get that power of Absoluteness.

00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:51.900
For example, Christ, when He saw Marie Magdalene   being stoned,

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.720
He stood before her. Now, Christ

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.000
was an Incarnation of Truth and He had nothing to do with the prostitute,

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:13.660
has no relationship with her, whatsoever. But He stood before her and asked the people,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:19.640
"Those who have not committed any sin, can throw stones at Me."

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:30.180
Such courage and such understanding of righteous behavior

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.080
just starts shining in your character.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.540
Then, you understand what is good in every religion.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.320
When you start reading Bible after realization, you understand

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.340
where it has gone wrong.

00:05:56.380 --> 00:06:01.800
If you have read Khalil Gibran - he's a very great realized soul -

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:07.220
and he says about Paul, very clearly,

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:14.140
"This Paul is a very strange man. I don't know what he's about to say.

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.580
He says something, believes in something, has no relationship with Christ."

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:29.840
A person like Khalil Gibran could say that, otherwise to say something against Bible,

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:36.140
was absolutely prohibited. He was thrown out of church, he didn't care.

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.080
I say the same thing about Paul.

00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.780
Paul has no place in Bible. He should not have been there at all.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:51.100
He was the one, who killed so many people.

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:58.260
There was a little boy of seventeen years whom he tortured and then he thought

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.000
this is the best way to gain more power to become somebody great

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:12.280
in the Christian community. So he took over and he started writing,

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:18.580
organizing. He's in the Bible - he has never seen Christ.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:27.260
All his writings suggest that he was mad with

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:34.220
ideas of his own and he put all these ideas on people.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.160
This Paul has created such problems today that Christians are having a big problem solving

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:51.460
the contradictions made by him. You must be have heard about the Bishop of Durham,

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:58.520
saying that Paul was correct and there was no Immaculate Conception.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:05.520
It takes courage to say that Christ's birth was an Immaculate Conception and it was,

00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:10.940
no doubt. Verily, He was the Son of God.

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.080
But to say that, you have to have that courage.

00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:23.580
This Bishop of Durham, just to get some more power, maybe,

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:28.420
or maybe to get some more Christians converted,

00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:34.500
he must have started this kind of a new ideas.

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:41.700
So many have been condemning Christ by this kind of authorities.

00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:48.640
And then when he was very much anointed and

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:56.120
given honor by Archbishop of Canterbury,

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:03.560
that church was burnt. They couldn't explain

00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:09.600
why the church was burnt and people saw

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:17.140
the lightning looming over that church for hours together -

00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:21.140
it was a miraculous thing that happened.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:29.440
But to people like Bishop of Durham or Archbishop, it was

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:36.140
the Grace of God that the lower part, the floor was not burnt, of the church.

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.040
Same way you find in Christianity,

00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:49.420
as you have in Hinduism, the same thing.

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:58.100
They said that there was a big problem in the Parliament

00:09:59.040 --> 00:10:04.880
when the Shankaracharya stood up and said that it is

00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:12.880
a right of a every Hindu to be Brahmin or a non-Brahmin, is written in the Gita.

00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:20.460
And a Member of Parliament came  to Me and asked Me, "Mother, what's the answer to this?"

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:27.300
I said Shankaracharya should know that Gita was written by Vyasa

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:32.300
and Vyasa was a illegitimate child of a fisher-woman.

00:10:33.640 --> 00:10:37.680
How could he write that a Brahmin is born?

00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:46.340
The caste system, that is the curse of our country, has come from these so called priests, the brahmins.

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:52.160
They are not Brahmins because those who are born again, those who know the Brahma,

00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:57.020
those who have felt the All-Pervading power of God, are the Brahma.

00:10:57.700 --> 00:11:04.520
Least said about the Islam, then the Sikhs, then all these religions you can find

00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:11.060
that there is so much of twisting of the words

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:14.740
just to suit their own purses and their minds.

00:11:15.940 --> 00:11:23.880
You get over all that and you become powerful to say that it's all wrong - that's not where we have to be.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.700
Now, so many things are coming out of Vatican

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:35.120
but the Catholics will close their ears - they would not like to listen to all that what is happening.

00:11:35.620 --> 00:11:40.280
Everybody will be exposed, who are doing falsehood.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:46.060
The time has come, the judgment time has come - all such people have to  be exposed.

00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:54.740
But the simple people, who love Christ, who love Krishna,

00:11:55.640 --> 00:12:00.540
who loved righteousness, will be saved.

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:09.600
After realization people also get lots of dynamic

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:13.620
forces within themselves which they never expected to get.

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:20.880
First of all, their innocence is awake.

00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:29.140
Whatever innocence they have lost through the stupidity of the society

00:12:29.800 --> 00:12:35.940
or the ideas given by the uh, uh.. enterprising

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:44.300
film industries or other, we can say, magazines and all kinds of publications -

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:53.340
all those things drop out. All the conditionings of the mind drop out and he becomes innocent,

00:12:53.980 --> 00:13:01.340
a innocent personality. An innocent personality is a very, very powerful personality.

00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:05.920
As Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.880
Such a person has a glint in the eye of innocence

00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:17.740
and such person can grow up to such a level that even a little glance of such a person

00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:21.180
can save people from calamities.

00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.520
The purity of mind, purity of character,

00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:32.380
all these starts shining in such a personality.

00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:38.600
And such a personality is an auspicious figure.

00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.500
Auspiciousness, we have forgotten about.

00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:47.500
If an auspicious person enters into the house -

00:13:48.040 --> 00:13:55.220
if somebody's sick that person gets all right, if there's quarrel in the house the quarrel subsides,

00:13:55.720 --> 00:14:02.360
if there's any problem that problem is solved. An auspicious person travelling by a train,

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.880
if there's an accident, nobody dies.

00:14:07.880 --> 00:14:11.900
Auspicious person is the person who is

00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:17.740
constructive and is releasing constructive forces all around him

00:14:19.340 --> 00:14:25.280
of very soothing, peaceful and a very powerful character.

00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:33.060
Such an auspicious personality is to be found in so many realized souls.

00:14:34.560 --> 00:14:42.660
Now the other day, one lady was telling Me that there are many realized souls walking about on this earth - I haven't seen any.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:49.240
They might grow their beard, they might wear some sort of a wig,

00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:53.860
they might wear some sort of a dress - that doesn't mean they're realized souls.

00:14:54.340 --> 00:14:59.460
Actually, a realized soul doesn't need to publish or to uh..exhibit

00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:03.620
in any way artificial that he's a realized soul.

00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:11.600
He could be a very ordinary person on the street or he could be a king. He could be

00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:19.560
a, a person just cleaning the hall here and he could be a Prime Minister.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:28.620
For such a personality all these things do not matter, whether he lives in comfort,

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.380
he doesn't feel the feeling of comfort, I should say.

00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:39.380
Whether he lives in complete poverty, he doesn't feel it.

00:15:40.220 --> 00:15:44.580
According to the pattern of his life, .

00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:48.920
according to the status of his life, he lives.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:54.540
Supposing he's born in a poor family, he lives like a poor man.

00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.880
If he's born in a rich family, he lives like a rich man.

00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:05.080
It is not necessary for a rich man to show off uh..that I'm a poor man

00:16:06.620 --> 00:16:09.980
because riches do not touch him.

00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:15.880
They have to be there because he has got it.

00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:19.580
But such a person is extremely generous.

00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:26.820
If he finds that somebody needs the money, he'll give but if he finds that somebody doesn't need the money, he will not give

00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:30.980
and sometimes people are surprised - they think he's miserly.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:36.220
Because the sense of discretion is tremendous in an innocent person.

00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.960
He develops that sense of discretion so spontaneously -

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:48.900
as soon as he sees the person, he knows how far to go with that person and how to deal with that person.

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:53.280
He doesn't have to ask any questions.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:03.060
One day some sahaja yogies came to Me in Poona and started telling Me

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:07.920
about one person that, "Mother, he's a politician, you be very careful with him

00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:14.260
and You, when You're dealing with him, You have to be very much uh.. on Your guard."

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:20.100
I said that's all you have come to tell Me all of you. They said, "That's all." I said now you sit down and I'll tell you.

00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:28.100
I said, I know, this man has eloped with somebody else's wife and this is an illegitimate child he has

00:17:28.280 --> 00:17:34.440
and he's this and he's that, he's that and they were all shocked how Mother came to know about it.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.040
So there is no need to put any guard - you are guarded all the time.

00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:50.000
The blessings of protection, are all the time with a person, who is a realized soul.

00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:56.820
That's why he's not bothered. He's least bothered about uh..insurances,

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:05.700
he's least bothered about money, he's least bothered about getting elected -

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.560
he lives in his own world of reality.

00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:23.320
Such a person may suddenly become dynamically artistic -

00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:27.740
he may not have known art at all.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:35.040
I met one gentleman who came to sahaja yoga, who had lost his job, he had no money, nothing with him,

00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:43.260
so he said, "Mother, I have no money, what am I to do?" I said don't you worry, you take your realization. He got his realization.

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:52.500
I said why don't you try interior decoration. He said, "What, I don't know timber, I don't know the quality anything, [UNCLEAR- KNOW?] what to do it."

00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:59.500
I said you just see vibrations and work it out. And you'll be amazed, he's now a very good

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.580
interior decorator - he's making good money out of it.

00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.040
So many things like that happen to that person. Suddenly, you get your realization,

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:20.600
you start making poems, poetry - that can happen to anyone of you.

00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:26.540
But these are still, I would say, are temptations - you should not get lost with it.

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:33.120
Some people can get lots of money, just after realization - it's a temptation.

00:19:34.500 --> 00:19:42.000
Suddenly from somewhere, you might get money but, I would say, it's a temptation - you have to go ahead with it.

00:19:43.340 --> 00:19:46.820
Some people might get a big position suddenly,

00:19:47.420 --> 00:19:55.220
they may land up as something very uh.. great leaders -

00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:03.940
that's also, I think, is a temptation and one should not forget that this is all the Grace of God.

00:20:06.620 --> 00:20:11.920
The people, who are suffering from diseases, get cured. You saw yesterday, how two persons,

00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:17.620
within five minutes, got cured of such horrible diseases - they would have been dead.

00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:27.720
But those who get realization, also get protection from diseases.

00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:33.100
Say, a person suffering from A.I.D.S., will get protection.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:37.700
He may not go to the second stage.

00:20:38.860 --> 00:20:43.080
He might live all his life with the first stage, maybe, he might get get cured completely.

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:52.620
There can be lots of physical benefits he can have. His health will improve, he'll drop down, at least, 10 to 20 years

00:20:54.100 --> 00:20:59.300
and he can do lots of work without getting tired.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:07.660
Because you don't feel you're doing any work. Most of the headache is because we think we're doing the work.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:11.840
If we can stop thinking that we're doing any work,

00:21:13.760 --> 00:21:18.820
we are not tired. You just do the work, that's all, we don't think about it.

00:21:19.220 --> 00:21:25.300
In England, I find, everybody is [SHRI MATAJI EXHALES - HA]. 'What's the matter?' "I'm tired."

00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:30.640
'What have you done?' "Little cooking, that's all." Because you're thinking you're cooking -

00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:35.280
the cooking was spoilt because of that and now you're tired. [SHRI MATAJI EXHALES - HA]

00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:46.540
But the people who are realized souls, do not think about it. Now for example, there's a beautiful carpet here.

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:54.300
This doesn't belong to Me - thank God - and I'm looking at it.

00:21:56.120 --> 00:22:03.360
When I look at it, I just see the beauty, the joy that is put in it

00:22:03.840 --> 00:22:09.260
by the artist - I don't think, I just look at it, I witness it.

00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:14.360
I just don't think and the joy that has created this

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:20.620
completely starts pouring into Me, relieving Me completely.

00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:26.320
To possess something is a headache.

00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:33.020
You possess, say, this carpet, then you must insure it,

00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:36.740
would be worried - I hope it's not getting dirty or this and that.

00:22:39.560 --> 00:22:45.980
To possess some personality, somebody as a husband or a wife, is another, the greater headache

00:22:46.780 --> 00:22:51.800
because all the time you're trying to possess, other person is trying to run away.

00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:01.400
But you stand on your own legs - not to be possessed by anyone nor do you possess anyone.

00:23:03.100 --> 00:23:06.480
You stand in your own glory, enjoying yourself.

00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:13.700
You're not bothered as to who is your husband and that you should possess him.

00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:18.800
"All right, if it's my husband, all right, I can enjoy his company all right.

00:23:19.160 --> 00:23:26.060
But if he doesn't want to enjoy my company, I'm not going to fall at his feet. Let him go ahead.

00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:34.520
Makes no difference to me to my life."

00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:40.260
And you'll be surprised, all such people become very good husband and wives -

00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:43.440
not only that but very good parents.

00:23:43.760 --> 00:23:50.940
We have seen now, in sahaja yoga, so many people are married - they're very happily married people and they have beautiful children too.

00:23:51.440 --> 00:23:55.540
Then you become very good parents because you understand your children

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:00.560
if they're born realized or not, if they have problems then how to correct the problems,

00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:04.900
how to treat them - you just don't go to doctors for every small little thing.

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:16.040
This has been already prophecized long, long time back, thousands of years back, in India

00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:22.480
by a very uh.. old astrologer called Bhrigu.

00:24:23.620 --> 00:24:27.200
He's the one who has written Bhrigu samhita,

00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:33.220
which is actually, we should say, he's the one who started astrology.

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:42.220
He has written that such and such time will come when the Kundalini will rise very easily

00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:46.440
and there will be no need to have any hospitals.

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:55.520
Is already being described but we do not read anything but something sensational,

00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.720
something nonsensical.

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:06.160
Now, people want to read something sensational, perhaps, we have become the matter.

00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:12.260
When we have become the matter, nothing can stir us but some sort of a shock.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:20.980
And that's why, we go about for this kind of literature which is shocking, which we call as sensational.

00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:28.140
A person who is a realized soul, his whole value system changes thoroughly.

00:25:28.640 --> 00:25:35.900
and his whole being becomes such a deep personality that he understands what is

00:25:36.500 --> 00:25:43.440
stupid, what is idiotic, what is wasteful and what is nourishing.

00:25:45.880 --> 00:25:51.700
As if in his brain a new light has come to judge what is good for him.

00:25:55.580 --> 00:26:00.360
Then such a person, suddenly develops, beautiful voice.

00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:05.480
He becomes very compassionate, kind.

00:26:06.660 --> 00:26:14.320
I've seen people who have been all the time abusing each other suddenly become very sweet to each other -

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:21.480
they give up abusing. They use very gentle, beautiful words.

00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:28.940
They do things to please each other, they try to find out how to make others happy

00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:37.180
Their little, little ways are so sweet.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:40.620
I cannot relate all of them to you

00:26:43.060 --> 00:26:49.800
but their one incident I'll tell you that will make you understand

00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:54.820
how these people understand how to make you happy.

00:26:57.200 --> 00:27:04.100
Like we have between ourselves a custom called a rakhi

00:27:04.920 --> 00:27:11.660
in which a brother is to be chosen and you have to tie a, a little

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:15.580
thread on the wrist of that person.

00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:23.400
We don't have this kind of a system in the West, Western societies.

00:27:24.820 --> 00:27:32.000
But when Alexander invaded our country, he was married to an Indian lady

00:27:33.660 --> 00:27:39.060
and as luck would have it, unfortunately, once he lost his battle

00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:44.860
and he was taken into prison and taken uh..

00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:52.860
into a dungeon, I should say, and made him stay there. This king called Puru

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:59.780
wanted that somehow Alexander should not proceed any further in India to destroy it.

00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:08.660
Now, that was the day of this rakhi, full moon.

00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:12.260
His wife was a clever Indian lady

00:28:13.140 --> 00:28:19.620
so she sent a, that thread in one plate covered with a cloth - that's how we send it -

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:27.120
to the king and the king asked, "All right, tie that to me."

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:32.900
When they tied it, he said, "Who is my sister, who has sent for me?"

00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.700
They said, "It is Alexander's wife."

00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:44.300
"She has sent it to me, I've become her brother, Oh God!" He ran to the dungeon,

00:28:44.780 --> 00:28:52.440
he fell at the feet of Alexander, he said, "Sir, I'm sorry. Uh.. whatever I've done, please forgive me.

00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:58.660
You are welcome." He took him with him and he put him on his throne. He said, "Let me wash your feet,

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:05.560
you are my sister's husband, I've done such a harm to you. God will never forgive me - you have to forgive me."

00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:13.780
This Alexander had no idea what had gone wrong with this king - he thought he's gone mad or what, what is he trying to do?

00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:22.740
So, then he gave lots of clothes and lots of ornaments for his sister and everything and he sent her back to his house.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:31.980
When he came home, his wife was smiling, he said, "What is this, this king has gone mad or what?

00:29:32.220 --> 00:29:38.160
He has left me alone and now if I conquer, I may win the whole of India."

00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:46.080
She said, "What did you do?" She said, "Nothing, I just sent a thread to him today." He said, "Thread,

00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:50.780
what was that thread?" She said, "Is a thread from a sister to a brother."

00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:58.020
"Oh God," he said, "For a thread he left me out, I'm such a dangerous person."

00:29:58.400 --> 00:30:03.620
He said, "These Indians with their symbols and their lives, I cannot manage them.

00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:09.780
Imagine, for a thread they leave out such an, such an enemy, like me." He said, "I'm not going to go further."

00:30:10.100 --> 00:30:13.740
And then he took a poet Chandravardai from

00:30:13.940 --> 00:30:18.640
Delhi and went back and he had tremendous respect for India.

00:30:20.800 --> 00:30:25.520
These small, small things, how beautiful they make you!

00:30:28.820 --> 00:30:33.320
A little gesture like that can give you such a great

00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:38.940
uh..honor and such a great personality.

00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:47.340
These things have happened many a times in many places

00:30:49.060 --> 00:30:54.840
but we do not see them because we have no eyes just now to see them.

00:30:56.580 --> 00:31:02.260
In the same way, in every family there are such sweet, sweet things that happen.

00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:10.520
between children, between husband and wife, between in-laws

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:19.100
but we never see them. Because of that we cannot organize our family,

00:31:19.580 --> 00:31:26.020
our relationships with neighbors, with all the rest of the people, in a beautiful manner.

00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:34.020
Every human-being is very beautifully made - lot of beauty is hidden in him.

00:31:34.680 --> 00:31:41.700
Of course in the light of a realized soul, it manifests - people see that very clearly.

00:31:42.700 --> 00:31:49.520
All of our beauty is, somehow or the other, shut down because our heart is closed.

00:31:49.860 --> 00:31:56.620
We're frightened of another person, we're worried about another person, we cannot trust other persons

00:31:57.140 --> 00:32:02.920
but a realized person trusts, trusts everyone and everyone trusts him.

00:32:03.900 --> 00:32:10.660
This is a very big thing that can happen to all of you when you're realized - you'll be surprised

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:15.920
how you will have that confidence within your self to trust everyone.

00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:28.160
Now, the other things that happen is, I told you, that your eyes become innocent.

00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:34.540
Our attention is all the time going from here to there.

00:32:34.740 --> 00:32:39.760
This thing you see, then that thing you see, that thing you see, going on seeing this to that, to that to that.

00:32:40.220 --> 00:32:48.200
Then you settle down - the attention settles down. Your attention, absolutely, is at peace

00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:55.580
and you see something and every small thing you see, you see it deeply.

00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:01.720
Many people ask Me, "Mother, how do you remember our names then.

00:33:01.920 --> 00:33:07.480
How do You know us and how do You remember our problems?" It's love!

00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:14.100
If you love someone, you know everything about that person - don't you?

00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:25.140
It's just love. You don't have to keep a diary, you don't have to keep a regular

00:33:25.340 --> 00:33:30.480
uh.. sort of reading of whom you know, whom you don't know - it's just love!

00:33:32.220 --> 00:33:40.100
Today somebody asked Me from the newspaper uh.. "How many uh.. sahaja yogies You have?" I said, 'I don't know.' Really, I don 't know.

00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:49.460
How many there are in this world, I don't know. "How many thousands?" I said, 'I don't know.' But I can make them out anywhere they are.

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:55.960
Wherever they may be - supposing I'm in the vicinity, I meet them immediately - it just happens.

00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:01.720
It's very remarkable how a sahaja yogi recognizes another sahaja yogi.

00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:07.460
There was a lady who was working in Rome and she happened to go to Sicily.

00:34:08.120 --> 00:34:14.920
There's another one from England, she went to Sicily and both were feeling uh.. little lonely because

00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:22.920
you see, others were drinking, smoking and abusing and all sorts of things were going on. So the one who was from England

00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:29.340
just looked up and saw another one sitting and she said, "Oh God, she's a realized soul!"

00:34:30.440 --> 00:34:38.580
So she went to her, so the other one asked her, "Have you got realization from Shri Mataji?" And they just embraced each other.

00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:48.240
There's no lust, there's no greed - all these stupid ideas that have come to us

00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:53.780
of homosexuality, this and that, these are all, all is lost.

00:34:55.800 --> 00:34:59.280
You just love the other person only for love sake.

00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:07.040
Pure love that manifests.

00:35:07.940 --> 00:35:14.640
You see the whole world as a drama - you witness it; watching everything that's happening.

00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:21.620
You're not worried, you're not upset. I'm never upset about the

00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:26.240
uh.. airport or going to the aeroplane - nothing of the kind -

00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:35.660
because I know the aeroplane has to wait for Me and I reach there, the aeroplane is there.

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:43.920
But I don't try to trouble others by going late but I never hurry anyone, never trouble anyone -

00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:50.620
just it's so simple. But people are in such a hurry to do something

00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:59.380
because when we're not realized, we're standing in the waves of thought.

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:06.260
Like the water - one wave rises falls off, another wave rises falls off, another wave rises falls off.

00:36:06.520 --> 00:36:10.660
We're on the cusp, cusp of every wave of our thoughts.

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:15.980
But there's a little, very little space in between.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:21.420
One thought comes from the future or from the past goes to the past or past to the future

00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:25.420
and we're just dancing on top of those thoughts.

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:31.540
When the Kundalini rises, these thoughts elongate and the space increases,

00:36:33.260 --> 00:36:38.380
then you become thoughtlessly aware - you're aware but you're thoughtless.

00:36:42.340 --> 00:36:47.780
It's like, you're standing in the water, you're worried of the waves

00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.520
but supposing you're in the boat, you're enjoying the waves.

00:36:54.280 --> 00:36:58.800
You're not worried about the waves any more. You see them, clearly, you see them

00:36:59.020 --> 00:37:04.800
rising, falling - you enjoy the waves. You are in a strong boat sitting here to enjoy them.

00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:12.480
They know all these skirmishes and all these squabbles of life, do not disturb you.

00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:18.760
You're not bothered with these things because there's such a peace

00:37:20.080 --> 00:37:23.020
of beautiful existence within yourself.

00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:32.400
That is, what I call, thoughtlessly aware but beyond that is doubtlessly aware.

00:37:34.420 --> 00:37:41.840
When you practice sahaja yoga, gradually you start seeing so many miracles happening to you, surprisingly so many things happen.

00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:49.020
How could it be, how could it have happened!

00:37:52.280 --> 00:37:57.660
Even in money, power, anything. You suddenly

00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:05.580
faced with something which is unexpected blessings

00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:14.280
and you can't believe it - then you know, "Oh, I'm in the Kingdom of God

00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:20.420
and it's God who's showering blessings upon me."

00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:29.920
Then the doubts fall off and you rise to a higher consciousness as we call it as doubtless awareness.

00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:41.740
You have to of course meditate about five minutes in the morning, five minutes in the evening - not much time is needed.

00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:50.180
We have watches these days; I think My grandmother never knew what was a watch and My

00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:58.500
even Mother never used a watch, perhaps. She, we had a big grandfather's clock in the house, that was sufficient for all of us.

00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:07.620
But here everybody has a watch, everybody must save the time, must see the time - save the time for what?

00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:12.640
To waste it somewhere.

00:39:13.540 --> 00:39:20.540
Like somebody was hurrying up too much, I said, "What's such a hurry?" "Oh God, I must go, that pub will close now."

00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:32.840
Where are we spending our time? All this time saving is for meditation,

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:40.880
for spending time in the presence of God, enjoying His blessings,

00:39:42.020 --> 00:39:48.580
swimming in the ocean of His Grace and Joy.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:40:00.260
We don't realize that all these ideas of saving time and all such things have come to us

00:40:01.820 --> 00:40:09.320
because this is the time where you have to really save time to be in the company of God.

00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:19.440
The other day a lady asked Me a question about donations, that we give donations

00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:24.300
to some people because they're realized souls and all that.

00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:31.240
There's no need for donations at all.

00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:39.600
So many people, the other day I met, some people belonging to some community,

00:40:40.120 --> 00:40:43.180
they're all the time travelling from places to places.

00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:49.400
I said, 'Why are you travelling?' "Because we belong to this community, we're realized souls."

00:40:49.680 --> 00:40:54.440
Self-certified realized souls going round all the places, enjoying life.

00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:02.180
I said, 'Realized souls, why do you certify yourself as realized souls,

00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:09.440
how are you realized souls?' If you're realized soul you must be able to give realization to another person -

00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.660
that's the minimum of minimum.

00:41:16.000 --> 00:41:22.980
That's the gift of realization - you should be able to cure others - that's also minimum of minimum.

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:30.180
But you should be able to master all the

00:41:30.520 --> 00:41:36.380
sciences and all the Shastras, that is all the Scriptures.

00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:49.840
You should be able to answer every type of a person without losing patience.

00:41:53.600 --> 00:42:00.240
And that is what one has to be, then I would say, that in sahaja yoga you become a guru.

00:42:03.740 --> 00:42:11.360
But such a guru is extremely compassionate, kind, guiding, looking after him.

00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:20.780
Every little bit is looked after,

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:28.640
then it's a guru. Mostly the gurus look after your purse

00:42:29.380 --> 00:42:36.580
or your wives, maybe, at the most. Is that the way they are gurus?

00:42:39.460 --> 00:42:45.660
Their lives are blackened by their ill deeds - they're evil people,

00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:53.060
they're devils, some of them, born again to test your intelligence and your understanding.

00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:59.480
They may come as priests, they might come as Jews, they might come uh.

00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:03.660
as.. Hindus, they may come as anything.

00:43:06.820 --> 00:43:10.600
But they're evil doers of the worst type -

00:43:10.900 --> 00:43:15.800
not that only they will go to Hell but all disciples of theirs will go to Hell.

00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:26.200
But how will you know, how will you know

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:32.400
that such and such a person is bad or good - through your vibrations.

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:37.140
How will you know Christ - through your vibrations.

00:43:38.660 --> 00:43:45.680
Everything you can know through your vibrations an absolute correct answers

00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:52.580
will be there. Even if you have ten children sitting, tie their eyes

00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:58.880
and ask them, "What's wrong with this gentleman?"  They will all raise the same finger, meaning he feels very guilty.

00:44:04.560 --> 00:44:08.700
Because you feel it on your Central Nervous System

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:17.700
This is what has to happen to all of you.

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:24.440
After realization, you have to grow. It's like a little sapling

00:44:25.440 --> 00:44:31.800
which is to be looked after, which is to be nourished, which is to be grown.

00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:40.420
And then you will understand, who are you - you are the Spirit.

00:44:42.840 --> 00:44:50.760
Your glory, your beauty, your righteousness, your virtues

00:44:51.460 --> 00:44:58.160
everything will manifest. Out of you great people like Abraham Lincoln, will come out.

00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:07.640
We have given up hopes of having those great people - they're all going to come out of you.

00:45:07.900 --> 00:45:10.920
May God bless you!

00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:23.100
Today, as I told you yesterday, there were too many questions.

00:45:24.140 --> 00:45:31.940
Some were sensible, some were rather aggressive and some were nonsensical - doesn't matter.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:39.520
We can give some time to ask few questions today. I think, I should give realization

00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:45.040
and establish yesterday's realization and also

00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.540
give to the new people.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:19.560
Please ask the questions. You're thoughtlessly aware, most of you - you don't know what to ask?

00:46:27.220 --> 00:46:34.620
[INAUDIBLE]

00:46:35.960 --> 00:46:40.600
- Where did You get Your knowledge?
 - Again, they want to know about Me.

00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:45.680
I got it from My very childhood, I was born with it.

00:46:47.220 --> 00:46:55.460
Even if I say I got it yesterday, what difference will it make to you, sir? This question has no meaning.

00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:29.720
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Please, please stand up and say. Which is the one? All right.

00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:38.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:46.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:54.440
[INAUDIBLE]

00:47:54.760 --> 00:48:02.260
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:06.900
[INAUDIBLE]

00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:15.080
- The question is, what is the Self-realization and how do you know that you have got it? This is in short.
 - Aw, it's too much.
  - [INAUDIBLE]

00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:22.780
The whole lecture was about it, Sir. Yes, yesterday you were not there?

00:48:23.360 --> 00:48:30.320
I'm sorry, you can listen to My lecture, all right. You can take the tape - it explains what is Self-realization.

00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.320
All right, is very simple to understand.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:44.520
You'll get it just now, then you will know what it is. Please be seated, thank you.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:05.080
You must stand up otherwise we don't see you - anybody who has to ask the question. Yes, please.

00:49:06.240 --> 00:49:14.100
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:14.280 --> 00:49:22.000
[INAUDIBLE]

00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:28.140
Question is, that she was not here yesterday and would it be possible for You to please

00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:32.820
explain something about the internal health and knowing that through the fingers?

00:49:33.540 --> 00:49:39.620
Ah, internal health, through the fingers? All right.

00:49:42.300 --> 00:49:49.300
Of course, tomorrow you're coming for a workshop and in the details they'll be telling you, that I told you this

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:57.000
one, two, three, four, five, six and seven - these are seven centers and on this hand are seven centers.

00:49:58.640 --> 00:50:03.160
Now, these seven centers are represented here as you see them.

00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:09.720
So, this is the one, is the lowest, lowest one here

00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:14.960
then, this is the one which is the second one, yellow one.

00:50:15.580 --> 00:50:22.060
Then you have, this is the one which is here at the neck

00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:29.080
Vishudhdhi, as they call it. This is the one which is at the naval point.

00:50:29.460 --> 00:50:37.300
This is the one, which is on the left-hand side on the back but on the right-hand side in front, where there's the red mark.

00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:43.940
And this is the one is the heart. This is the one is the limbic area

00:50:44.840 --> 00:50:49.120
or we can say, the seventh chakra, this one.

00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:59.720
Now, they're all related physically, mentally, emotionally and spiritually.

00:51:01.800 --> 00:51:07.480
Now if you want to see the physical side - now supposing, on your hands

00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:14.720
the whole thing cannot be explained in a short time but, I would say, now supposing, in your hand

00:51:14.940 --> 00:51:19.380
you are feeling something is burning here

00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:26.180
that means there's something wrong here in the throat on the right-hand side, on the physical side.

00:51:27.520 --> 00:51:35.620
But supposing this is burning, then it means that you are feeling guilty

00:51:36.500 --> 00:51:39.580
and you have developed a weakness here.

00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:49.080
It relates, the permutations and combinations are there which will know very easily

00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:57.200
and also there are little booklets in which you can read and find out and it's very simple to understand.

00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:09.360
Yes, please.

00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:18.880
- Your concept of, I'm sorry
 - Concept?

00:52:19.760 --> 00:52:25.320
- The concept of good health?
 - Hell
  - Hell, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

00:52:25.720 --> 00:52:32.220
- Could You please tell us something about Your concept of Hell?
 - Hell? [ SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:38.460
Ah.. Why should you talk of something  not so good?

00:52:42.780 --> 00:52:45.760
Hell has been described by so many people

00:52:48.840 --> 00:52:51.960
but you don't feel like talking about it.

00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:59.640
There are lectures, I have so many lectures on Hell also

00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:06.500
and you can take, you can come and listen to them but, I mean, just now before realization

00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:14.420
I don't want to talk of these things because when the mood spoils and then it's not good. So, will you excuse Me.

00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:21.360
You can go and listen to My, like I've got at least, I don't know how many thousand lectures I've given,

00:53:21.580 --> 00:53:26.940
out of them so many are about Hell - it's not a concept, it's a reality.

00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:40.140
Yes, please. Please get up, please. First you get up, then is easy to see you.

00:53:40.380 --> 00:53:45.000
Will you please get up, please, you please, yes? Yes, thank you.

00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:53.800
I was not here for Your lecture [UNCLEAR - YESTERNIGHT OR YESTERDAY?] but before I get certified

00:53:54.060 --> 00:54:01.920
Self-realized, what [UNCLEAR]

00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:11.320
The question is said that he was not here yesterday uh.. , "If I get Self-realization in this lifetime,

00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:16.520
- in My next lifetime will I have to start all over again?
 - No, no, not at all.

00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:25.440
Not at all. You'll have free will to be born whenever you like. You'll know all about it,

00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:33.040
you'll come with a new fervor - this is never lost. That's something is eternal life.

00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.860
This is the Eternal life that is never lost.

00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.200
Is there anybody else, please?

00:54:52.100 --> 00:54:58.800
[UNCLEAR]

00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:06.500
[INAUDIBLE]

00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:13.120
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:19.560
Question is said that, "The Self-realization that You intend to give us to-night

00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:26.680
which You have also mentioned is like a sapling that has to be nursed - Is there a higher level to be achieved after this?"

00:55:26.980 --> 00:55:34.360
Yes. You see Self-realization is, as I said, is a sapling.

00:55:35.300 --> 00:55:41.600
It is to be looked after, is to be stationed and then this

00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:48.360
when it is embedded properly into your being, it grows into a tree.

00:55:48.680 --> 00:55:55.140
Then you can give to others, others can come for support from you.

00:55:56.500 --> 00:56:03.560
So, you have to grow up to that point. In some people it doesn't even take one day -

00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:07.940
that very same day they are there - very surprising!

00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:13.840
But some people do take some time because the Kundalini being the Mother

00:56:14.580 --> 00:56:18.500
She gives you realization, the breakthrough all right

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:23.900
but then again She goes back to the places where it requires attention.

00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:31.620
So all these things to be understood. About a month is more than sufficient, I think, for everybody to stand on their own legs.

00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:47.380
[INAUDIBLE]

00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:54.420
- What is the difference
 - Annh?
  - What is the difference between Self-realization and God realization.

00:56:54.800 --> 00:57:00.620
Quite a lot, hunh... Self-realization is the beginning of it

00:57:01.160 --> 00:57:05.100
and then the God realization is a stage

00:57:05.380 --> 00:57:10.840
where you develop capacity to control all the elements, everything.

00:57:11.480 --> 00:57:16.520
There's lot of difference, is can be achieved by sahaja yogies also.

00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:29.540
You see for some people, it's quite a long distance but for some people is not.

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:34.620
It is, it depends on one's own capabilities.

00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:49.340
[UNCLEAR]

00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:57.460
[UNCLEAR]

00:57:57.740 --> 00:58:04.580
[UNCLEAR]

00:58:04.840 --> 00:58:12.000
- Kya?
 - Umm, You mentioned that you have to save time, not to waste time

00:58:12.200 --> 00:58:19.980
- and use that time for meditation, so is that the way to spend all our time and is there any [UNCLEAR]
 - No, no, no, I told you, you need only five minutes.

00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:26.120
But save time means, you must save time in the sense that

00:58:26.360 --> 00:58:31.420
you should not waste your time in useless things -
 which you do not after realization.

00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:38.700
- [UNCLEAR]
 - Yes. No I said five minutes morning and five minutes evening.

00:58:38.940 --> 00:58:46.360
Now the gentleman who is standing here, he is the chief executive of a very big factory

00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:53.980
or we should say, a very big business in India, and he's the owner of that

00:58:54.420 --> 00:59:00.600
steel but he has found time to come down to see you all.

00:59:05.140 --> 00:59:13.040
- Yes, please.
 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - On Me
   - [INAUDIBLE]

00:59:13.260 --> 00:59:15.800
[SHRI MATAJI LAUGHS]

00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:23.400
Do You have to understand the process, uh,  do You have to understand the process of Self-realization to actually get it?

00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:31.400
No, not at all. You'll get it without understanding it but you've been asking about it, so I'm telling.

00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:38.440
But later on, if you have to give realizations to others, better know it. It's very simple though

00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:42.560
but realization you can get just like that.

00:59:43.600 --> 00:59:49.600
You need not even know My language - you can get realization.

00:59:55.300 --> 01:00:02.760
I was wondering [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.300
[INAUDIBLE]

01:00:07.520 --> 01:00:10.900
The question is, "How do You awaken the Kundalini?"

01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:16.320
All right, that's something, the, it is a spontaneous thing,

01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:24.200
it just awakens in My presence. It's like the Mother Earth awakening a seed.

01:00:26.080 --> 01:00:33.420
I must be something of course, no doubt. And once you are realized, you can also awaken the Kundalini.

01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.780
But spontaneously it will be awakened.

01:00:48.900 --> 01:00:53.520
I, when I was born, I knew My mission, I knew what I had to do

01:00:54.740 --> 01:00:59.340
and that I had to find out a method, en-masse realization.

01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:05.680
And in My own meditative way, I studied human-beings, what are their problems,

01:01:06.180 --> 01:01:13.860
why can't they have enmasse realization. Because any discovery unless and un it is made public,

01:01:14.100 --> 01:01:17.140
available to everyone, has no meaning.

01:01:18.360 --> 01:01:24.180
So many people have been killed, given poisons and tortured

01:01:25.560 --> 01:01:32.220
and the time had come also for Me to do the job and somehow I've managed it.

01:01:34.060 --> 01:01:39.220
But you can also give realization to people once you're realized.

01:01:47.860 --> 01:01:50.860
[INAUDIBLE]

01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:57.720
- Can you get up please, also? Ah..
 - [INAUDIBLE]

01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.400
- Kya keh rahe?
 - I'm sorry, I didn't hear that.
  - Couldn't hear, I'm sorry, sir.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:15.220
- That's better.
 - [INAUDIBLE]

01:02:58.840 --> 01:03:06.300
- What time?
 - [INAUDIBLE]
  - Annh?
   - [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:13.520
All the elements, all the elements. These elements, the essence of this elements, you see,

01:03:13.960 --> 01:03:18.380
make the chakras, all the elements.

01:03:19.800 --> 01:03:26.020
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - Which are the useless ones?
  - Umm?
   - Which are the useless ones?

01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:33.300
- All of them are useful. Hunh!
 - Useless
  - All the five elements. Yes.

01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:42.080
[INAUDIBLE]

01:03:42.880 --> 01:03:48.500
- What's he saying? Kuch sunai nahin de raha.
 - [INAUDIBLE]

01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:54.660
- Which are the useless elements and which are the useful elements.
 - There aren't any. All of them are very useful, sir.

01:03:55.100 --> 01:04:01.920
[UNCLEAR]

01:04:02.200 --> 01:04:10.020
- What...
 - [UNCLEAR]

01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:16.440
- What's it?
 - [UNCLEAR]
  - I think he's just making some poem
   - Kya keh rahe hain?

01:04:16.640 --> 01:04:20.380
- Annh?
 - Just making an observation
  - Oh, I see.

01:04:20.600 --> 01:04:27.600
It's just an observation. [ALL CLAP N LAUGH] All right, please be seated. If you don't mind,

01:04:27.800 --> 01:04:35.380
please be seated. You'll find out how the elements are helping to build up our chakras

01:04:35.820 --> 01:04:42.740
and how ultimately the Kundalini passes through them and enlightens those elements within ourselves.

01:04:43.320 --> 01:04:47.960
There is a subtle of every element which makes the chakras,

01:04:48.180 --> 01:04:54.240
all right? These are all questions which will come to your mind, I know, because it's a scientific

01:04:54.440 --> 01:05:00.640
uh.. style is to understand that way. But to be very frank, you see,

01:05:00.820 --> 01:05:04.900
to get your realization you don't have to know all these things.

01:05:05.820 --> 01:05:11.620
First you get your realization. Like say, it is dark there's no light, then

01:05:12.380 --> 01:05:19.520
supposing, you ask Me, how to make out Mr. this from [UNCLEAR - THEM?], I'll say put on the light first.

01:05:20.920 --> 01:05:26.800
And to put on the light you have to just switch on - then you can find out.

01:05:27.820 --> 01:05:31.020
You must have patience with yourself, isn't it?

01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:36.780
All right, you be seated and then you get your realization and then know all about it.

01:05:37.700 --> 01:05:41.900
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - What's it?

01:05:42.100 --> 01:05:47.460
- [INAUDIBLE]
 - You be seated.

01:05:48.140 --> 01:05:52.660
You get your realization - it's like getting a light in your hand.

01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:59.800
[INAUDIBLE]

01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:09.700
Please be seated. Yes. The enquiry is very good.

01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:14.560
At least people have given a thought to it.

01:06:16.580 --> 01:06:22.920
Once it works out, it would be even better for you to see yourself what it is.

01:06:23.820 --> 01:06:29.940
If doesn't work out, it will work out tomorrow, it will work out day after

01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:37.260
but it must work out first. First you must have entry into that part, that area

01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:41.840
to understand, with a light in your hand.

01:06:43.860 --> 01:06:49.720
You have not yet entered into that area. As I said , this is the knowledge of the roots

01:06:50.820 --> 01:06:54.480
and to go to the roots you have to be a subtler being.

01:06:55.300 --> 01:07:00.660
Once you become that subtler being, then you can move into your roots and find out yourself.

01:07:02.980 --> 01:07:10.300
It's not like any knowledge of the tree that you can just see here for yourself.

01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:17.740
You have to become a subtler being and then you start seeing for yourself everything.

01:07:18.380 --> 01:07:25.240
But I'm happy that you have enquiry about it. Now this enquiry is going to help you very much

01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:32.640
to go deep down - is a sign of depth and sign of pure intelligence.

01:07:34.280 --> 01:07:37.400
May God bless you all!

01:07:47.980 --> 01:07:51.980
Now, very simple things are needed to be done

01:07:52.700 --> 01:07:58.500
to understand how to raise your own Kundalini, very simple thing.

01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:04.760
Firstly, as I said, we have to take help from the Mother Earth

01:08:06.500 --> 01:08:14.320
so, you have to take out your shoes because when you touch your Mother Earth with your shoes, She helps a lot

01:08:19.300 --> 01:08:25.800
and touch the Mother Earth with your feet. Now, the experiment is going to be on yourself

01:08:26.040 --> 01:08:31.300
[UNCLEAR - WHILE?] you are going to do the experiment yourself.

01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:37.480
I'm just going to tell you the procedure which is extremely simple,

01:08:37.940 --> 01:08:43.380
which you should follow intensely and it will work out.

01:08:44.900 --> 01:08:52.500
The main object is to get Self-realization. All of you should get Self-realization, is the main object.

01:08:53.600 --> 01:09:00.080
Once you get it, then to go further, we'll have the light in our hand.

01:09:05.520 --> 01:09:11.960
You please have your both the hands towards Me, like this.

01:09:14.920 --> 01:09:20.100
This means that the left,

01:09:20.780 --> 01:09:25.680
which is the hand of desire, is towards Me.

01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:34.680
and this is the hand of your action. So we are going to use this hand for the action within.

01:09:35.100 --> 01:09:41.580
How the movement works out of the Kundalini, you yourself will notice, you yourself will certify

01:09:41.780 --> 01:09:45.880
you yourself will see. I'm not going to certify you.

01:09:48.840 --> 01:09:55.540
Moreover, I cannot force it on you. It has to be done in complete freedom.

01:09:55.680 --> 01:09:59.040
because you have to achieve the Absolute Freedom.
