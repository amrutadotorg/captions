Final draft: Transcription of Shri Mataji’s
talk:

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.270
SAHASRARA PUJA
4 MAY 1997

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.270
CABELLA

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:28.619
Today we all have assembled here to worship
the Sahasrara.

00:04:38.003 --> 00:04:53.295
As you have realised that Sahasrara is a very
important part of the subtle system.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:05:08.564
Of course this is a great day in 1970 that
this Chakra was opened up, but by that what

00:05:08.564 --> 00:05:12.715
you have achieved we have to see it.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:32.514
First of all when the Kundalini rises She
goes to your Void where is your dharma, and

00:05:32.514 --> 00:05:43.875
your dharma gets established at the Nahbi
Chakra, we can say, around the Nabhi Chakra.

00:05:43.875 --> 00:05:52.764
Your dharma gets established which is the
innate Pure Universal Religion.

00:05:52.764 --> 00:05:55.465
It’s established.

00:05:55.465 --> 00:06:00.885
But then the Kundalini rises higher.

00:06:00.885 --> 00:06:11.405
Despite the establishment of the dharma we
start becoming little bit aloof from other

00:06:11.405 --> 00:06:19.245
societies because we find they are amiss,
they have no dharma.

00:06:19.245 --> 00:06:25.645
Also, I think we are afraid that we might
get caught up with their adharmas.

00:06:25.645 --> 00:06:36.095
So, at that stage we don’t want to cross
the limits of Sahaja Yoga, want to keep to

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:43.915
Sahaja Yogis, to Sahaja Yoga programme, and
to our personal Sahaj life.

00:06:43.915 --> 00:06:54.755
Of course, it is important because first this
Chakra must be fully nourished, and this Chakra

00:06:54.755 --> 00:07:01.214
is actually moves around the Nahbi Chakra
which we know as Swadisthana.

00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:11.705
This Swadishtan Chakra is in a way very important
because it supplies energy to the brain.

00:07:11.705 --> 00:07:25.155
So when dharma is established the subtle energy
pushes through the Kundalini more energy for

00:07:25.155 --> 00:07:38.934
the Sahasrara, and also the energy for dharma
which was in the Sahasrara, the Swadistana

00:07:38.934 --> 00:07:41.405
also starts flowing with it.

00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:51.545
It crosses over and starts rising in the Sahasrara.

00:07:51.545 --> 00:08:01.905
Till then we are, I would say, we are not
yet full Sahaja Yogis because one can become

00:08:01.905 --> 00:08:04.795
fanatic about Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:04.795 --> 00:08:12.115
I have seen people who are so fanatic that
they cannot even meet people who are not Sahaja

00:08:12.115 --> 00:08:18.705
Yogis, they cannot even talk to people who
are not Sahaja Yogis, and all the time they

00:08:18.705 --> 00:08:24.695
are frightened of meeting people who are not
Sahaja Yogis.

00:08:24.695 --> 00:08:30.955
Of course you need not meet people who are
evil, people who are against Sahaja Yoga,

00:08:30.955 --> 00:08:39.314
who talk against it, but those who are seeking
the truth, it is our duty that we have to

00:08:39.314 --> 00:08:41.795
go to them.

00:08:41.795 --> 00:08:53.795
So when it reaches the state where it is established
in the brain, that time we go beyond dharma.

00:08:53.795 --> 00:08:58.115
Dharmateet - we become beyond.

00:08:58.115 --> 00:09:06.525
Dharma means that dharma becomes part and
parcel of our being, we cannot lose it.

00:09:06.525 --> 00:09:16.825
Sahaj dharma becomes within us a part and
parcel which is a very great achievement because

00:09:16.825 --> 00:09:22.975
then you don’t have to do any rituals, you
don’t have to worry about meeting other

00:09:22.975 --> 00:09:33.445
people, you don’t have to worry that your
vibrations will be harmed.

00:09:33.445 --> 00:09:43.504
Then you don’t catch from anyone, you don’t
catch also other negative forces.

00:09:43.504 --> 00:09:47.205
No one can harm you.

00:09:47.205 --> 00:09:53.445
That I call as the completion of your Shradha.

00:09:53.445 --> 00:10:03.545
That time Sahasrara is so fully englightened
that you become dharma.

00:10:03.545 --> 00:10:11.615
For example, we can give the example of Christ.

00:10:11.615 --> 00:10:16.064
Christ saw a protistute being stoned.

00:10:16.064 --> 00:10:19.825
Now Christ had nothing to do with the prositute,
I mean just the opposite of it.

00:10:19.825 --> 00:10:32.045
But when He saw she was stoned He took a stone
in His hand, and He says that those who think

00:10:32.045 --> 00:10:38.325
who have not sinned at all can throw a stone
at Me.

00:10:38.325 --> 00:10:46.995
And everyone was standing: Why is He taking
the side of a protistute.

00:10:46.995 --> 00:10:49.475
He is a religious man.

00:10:49.475 --> 00:10:54.255
He should also put stones on her.

00:10:54.255 --> 00:10:57.555
But He was standing on truth.

00:10:57.555 --> 00:11:05.064
That’s exactly what happens to you when
it is established in Sahasrara, in Sahasrara,

00:11:05.064 --> 00:11:06.985
that you stand on truth.

00:11:06.985 --> 00:11:17.355
There's a little difference in the, I would
say, in dharma and in truth.

00:11:17.355 --> 00:11:26.615
A dharma person might become too dharmic,
illogically dharmic and go to the right or

00:11:26.615 --> 00:11:28.565
to the left.

00:11:28.565 --> 00:11:39.964
A dharmic person might think he is the superior
person to others: that why should he be trying

00:11:39.964 --> 00:11:45.004
to save anybody else, let them go to hell,
who cares.

00:11:45.004 --> 00:11:50.305
This kind of an attitude can come in a person
who is dharmic.

00:11:50.305 --> 00:11:57.495
Also I have seen some Sahaja Yogis who start
new methods in Sahaja Yoga.

00:11:57.495 --> 00:12:02.404
You do like this it will be alright, you do
like that it will be alright, because they

00:12:02.404 --> 00:12:08.495
are not stagnated at the point of dharma,
so they start telling people that you do this

00:12:08.495 --> 00:12:10.374
way do that way.

00:12:10.374 --> 00:12:17.365
But when you rise to the point of truth, then
you don’t do any rituals, you don’t need

00:12:17.365 --> 00:12:28.195
any rituals, you are not bothered, because
you are in dharma and here you are standing

00:12:28.195 --> 00:12:33.695
on the truth, and truth is much greater than
dharma.

00:12:33.695 --> 00:12:45.594
For example, a person who is standing on truth
- he doesn’t care for any absurd ideas about

00:12:45.594 --> 00:12:49.594
religion even about Sahaj religion.

00:12:49.594 --> 00:12:57.525
He doesn’t care that after all this is Sahaj
this is not Sahaj, he goes beyond.

00:12:57.525 --> 00:13:01.525
In the sense he sees a global truth within
himself.

00:13:01.525 --> 00:13:11.125
He sees the truth which is all pervading,
not only sees but he knows and he feels and

00:13:11.125 --> 00:13:15.735
he is in that truth.

00:13:15.735 --> 00:13:23.735
So when dharma flowers into truth it’s a
very beautiful happening and that should happen

00:13:23.735 --> 00:13:27.775
to all of you.

00:13:27.775 --> 00:13:33.565
So many things can linger on if you are only
on the dharma level.

00:13:33.565 --> 00:13:40.655
I have seen people going into ego, making
money.

00:13:40.655 --> 00:13:45.805
Sometimes they don’t even ask me and go
on doing things which they should not do.

00:13:45.805 --> 00:13:50.975
They do wrong things which are not good for
Sahaja Yoga.

00:13:50.975 --> 00:14:01.995
There is no humility about it and they don’t
understand that whether this dharma is standing

00:14:01.995 --> 00:14:05.265
on truth or untruth.

00:14:05.265 --> 00:14:11.595
So we have to go to the foundation of dharma
which is truth.

00:14:11.595 --> 00:14:18.935
As described before it’s a tree of life
which has got its roots in the brain and the

00:14:18.935 --> 00:14:21.235
branches in the body.

00:14:21.235 --> 00:14:28.225
So you have to go to the roots of everything
and that is the place where you reach when

00:14:28.225 --> 00:14:32.065
you are absolutely established in Sahasrara.

00:14:32.065 --> 00:14:45.925
In the Sahasrara are the roots of all these
ideas we have, or we can say, all these swarupas

00:14:45.925 --> 00:14:49.175
we have taken.

00:14:49.175 --> 00:14:52.065
We have now become dharmic.

00:14:52.065 --> 00:14:54.595
What is the root of dharma?

00:14:54.595 --> 00:15:00.015
Why should we be dharmic?

00:15:00.015 --> 00:15:01.435
What is the need to be dharmic?

00:15:01.435 --> 00:15:06.895
There are many people in this world who are
extremely adharmic living very well.

00:15:06.895 --> 00:15:12.965
According to, I mean, outward expression we
feel that they are very happy people, they

00:15:12.965 --> 00:15:21.045
are alright they are enjoying themselves while
we are deprived perhaps of all the so-called

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:24.565
enjoyments of these people.

00:15:24.565 --> 00:15:36.445
So at the state of only dharma things become
very important to us which are, may not be

00:15:36.445 --> 00:15:38.515
standing on truth.

00:15:38.515 --> 00:15:44.865
There are so many things like that I can point
it out to you that how Sahaja Yogis faulter,

00:15:44.865 --> 00:15:48.695
even after acheiving dharma state they faulter.

00:15:48.695 --> 00:16:01.965
I have seen people giving up their drugs,
alcoholism, giving up other kinds of addictions,

00:16:01.965 --> 00:16:03.915
even their language improves.

00:16:03.915 --> 00:16:14.655
And their, we can say, behaviour is changed,
they become humbler people no doubt, but still

00:16:14.655 --> 00:16:19.825
they are conscious that they are standing
on dharma.

00:16:19.825 --> 00:16:24.985
This consciousness has to disappear.

00:16:24.985 --> 00:16:43.805
At the state of Sahasrara this consciousness
disappears because truth is love and love

00:16:43.805 --> 00:16:46.425
is truth.

00:16:46.425 --> 00:16:53.075
That is the point where the Kundalini meets
the Heart Chakra.

00:16:53.075 --> 00:16:57.095
As you know the pita of heart is here.

00:16:57.095 --> 00:17:06.255
So when Kundalini pierces through that Heart
Chakra, what starts flowing in the brain,

00:17:06.255 --> 00:17:12.785
in the Sahasrara is the truth, but truth that
is love.

00:17:12.785 --> 00:17:21.075
There’s a difference between truth as itself
and truth that is love.

00:17:21.075 --> 00:17:27.045
So out of love for that prostitute that Christ
stood by her.

00:17:27.045 --> 00:17:38.345
He stood on the roots of truth no doubt, but
what was flowing through His heart was the

00:17:38.345 --> 00:17:41.935
love, the pure love.

00:17:41.935 --> 00:17:50.675
So now when we have pure love for someone,
we see the whole thing in a different manner,

00:17:50.675 --> 00:17:59.135
we see a person in a different manner and
it becomes very sweet.

00:17:59.135 --> 00:18:13.375
Otherwise truth can be very bitter, can be
very painful, but truth which is adorned with

00:18:13.375 --> 00:18:18.305
love is just like a flower without the thorns.

00:18:18.305 --> 00:18:30.335
It’s very interesting how a person who is
pouring with love and is standing on truth

00:18:30.335 --> 00:18:35.775
- that’s the personality you have to become.

00:18:35.775 --> 00:18:44.555
Now in the expression of love we can take
an example to understand.

00:18:44.555 --> 00:18:51.445
Supposing I meet somebody and he is telling
all kinds of horrible things about another

00:18:51.445 --> 00:18:54.815
person.

00:18:54.815 --> 00:19:01.775
So I feel tremendous love for him as well
as for the person whom he is telling all these

00:19:01.775 --> 00:19:02.775
things.

00:19:02.775 --> 00:19:13.975
So now I take to lie, a complete lie, which
is a truth, also in a way.

00:19:13.975 --> 00:19:18.155
I tell that person, see what are you talking.

00:19:18.155 --> 00:19:24.135
The person about whom you are saying all this
had been just praising you all the time and

00:19:24.135 --> 00:19:26.865
here you are talking like this.

00:19:26.865 --> 00:19:35.745
Now this is not the truth actually, but you
take the help of the lie, the other side of

00:19:35.745 --> 00:19:42.795
the truth, to bring out a friendship between
the two persons.

00:19:42.795 --> 00:19:52.095
So this is what is the work of love, that
it tries to bring people closer to each other:

00:19:52.095 --> 00:20:02.245
to say things by which they become one, united.

00:20:02.245 --> 00:20:09.865
So all the divisive methods that we have used
so far just disappear and we try to understand

00:20:09.865 --> 00:20:21.105
what is the method by which we can join people’s
heart.

00:20:21.105 --> 00:20:27.806
As it is you are in collective consciousness,
but this collective consciousness, if it is

00:20:27.806 --> 00:20:38.185
supericial you can achieve great results like
as you have done it - maybe you can build

00:20:38.185 --> 00:20:43.425
beautiful ashrams, you can do all this.

00:20:43.425 --> 00:20:54.025
But when it is filled with love, collective
consciousness, then the joy is complete of

00:20:54.025 --> 00:20:58.285
collective consciousness.

00:20:58.285 --> 00:21:01.615
Now people talk of peace.

00:21:01.615 --> 00:21:08.025
You cannot have peace without this new awareness
we call it collective consciousness, but in

00:21:08.025 --> 00:21:19.324
that also there has to be the main tattwa,
principle of love.

00:21:19.324 --> 00:21:30.905
For example now, Sahaja Yogis say from Germany
and Austria are going to Israel - it is very

00:21:30.905 --> 00:21:31.905
fulfilling.

00:21:31.905 --> 00:21:41.975
I was happy that they have chosen for this
Puja people from Israel, and then I found

00:21:41.975 --> 00:21:51.535
Israelies coming to Egypt forgetting all that
Muslims had done to them.

00:21:51.535 --> 00:22:00.705
It’s really remarkable how people get attracted
towards expression of their love, to their

00:22:00.705 --> 00:22:09.415
fellow men, to other Sahaja Yogis, and once
it starts growing you will be surprised how

00:22:09.415 --> 00:22:12.525
we can change this world.

00:22:12.525 --> 00:22:23.925
Most of the problems, human problems, are
due to hatred and is very commonly used - I

00:22:23.925 --> 00:22:30.125
hate, I hate, it’s absurdity, it’s a sin
to hate someone.

00:22:30.125 --> 00:22:33.355
Why do you hate someone.

00:22:33.355 --> 00:22:40.085
You can hate the sin, you can hate the evil,
but you should not hate people just for hating

00:22:40.085 --> 00:22:41.535
sake.

00:22:41.535 --> 00:22:49.005
This hatred that we have is responsible for
all the problems we have had so far.

00:22:49.005 --> 00:22:56.545
Because one person becomes very powerful,
by dividing people he becomes very powerful,

00:22:56.545 --> 00:23:03.065
and these divisive things have really crushed
so many countries.

00:23:03.065 --> 00:23:12.495
For example our country was divided by the
British, now they are having the division.

00:23:12.495 --> 00:23:15.935
This doesn’t stop.

00:23:15.935 --> 00:23:18.125
By dividing us what has happened?

00:23:18.125 --> 00:23:24.105
All the countries who have gone away from
India are suffering very much.

00:23:24.105 --> 00:23:30.005
Those people who tried to divide the country
thought that they’d become prime ministers,

00:23:30.005 --> 00:23:31.275
this that.

00:23:31.275 --> 00:23:35.865
Most of them have been murdered by their own
people.

00:23:35.865 --> 00:23:39.755
You can see clearly how hatred manifests itself.

00:23:39.755 --> 00:23:49.395
It starts from a small point and it manifests
all over, very clearly it can be seen in any

00:23:49.395 --> 00:23:51.675
country being divided.

00:23:51.675 --> 00:24:00.775
There’s no need to divide any country - that
creates more hatred and more trouble.

00:24:00.775 --> 00:24:11.805
In the same way in Sahaja Yoga we should not
think of have divisions.

00:24:11.805 --> 00:24:20.345
Now we have got a beautiful land – as that
you must have heard about near to Ganges.

00:24:20.345 --> 00:24:29.005
Now people are thinking if they can have separate
houses, separate compounds.

00:24:29.005 --> 00:24:32.745
Why?

00:24:32.745 --> 00:24:38.485
You know how to live collectively, you enjoy
collective life, so why do you want to have

00:24:38.485 --> 00:24:41.645
separate houses?

00:24:41.645 --> 00:24:44.405
What secrets are we going to have from each
other?

00:24:44.405 --> 00:24:53.775
After all whatever we do is known on the vibrations
- you cannot hide anything, so why have separate

00:24:53.775 --> 00:24:54.875
houses.

00:24:54.875 --> 00:25:01.685
Why do you want to have some privacy, because
in Sahaja Yoga there is no privacy.

00:25:01.685 --> 00:25:10.395
We know about everyone, what are they up to,
what are their problems, what chakras they

00:25:10.395 --> 00:25:11.465
are catching.

00:25:11.465 --> 00:25:12.545
Isn’t it?

00:25:12.545 --> 00:25:16.775
So there is no secret about anything in Sahaja
Yoga.

00:25:16.775 --> 00:25:23.205
Everyone knows about everyone, so what’s
the use of having privacy - also I can’t

00:25:23.205 --> 00:25:24.205
understand.

00:25:24.205 --> 00:25:31.745
It’s like this you see still the mind is
working like that.

00:25:31.745 --> 00:25:35.435
Then they are thinking of inheritance.

00:25:35.435 --> 00:25:44.355
Alright, I was saying that you can have inheritance,
but if your son is not a Sahaja Yogi, what

00:25:44.355 --> 00:25:45.355
to do.

00:25:45.355 --> 00:25:53.275
We cannot keep a culprit there to trouble
everyone.

00:25:53.275 --> 00:26:01.905
It is not the rules and regulations that are
going to keep you happy and joined together,

00:26:01.905 --> 00:26:08.485
but it is the pure collective consciousness
and its love.

00:26:08.485 --> 00:26:16.275
Because as you know we have no proper organisations,
we have no clergyship, we have nothing like

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:17.275
that.

00:26:17.275 --> 00:26:22.965
Leaders also can shift more times than Ganges
River can shift its course.

00:26:22.965 --> 00:26:24.455
So there is nothing like that.

00:26:24.455 --> 00:26:30.885
It’s all on a shifty sand we are standing,
all the time, and your Mother is another one

00:26:30.885 --> 00:26:34.225
who tries all kinds of tricks.

00:26:34.225 --> 00:26:46.945
The reason is I want you to stand on rocks
and this rock is emitting love, is emitting

00:26:46.945 --> 00:26:58.875
that Divine Love, and the joy of that love
is really so beautiful.

00:26:58.875 --> 00:27:05.205
For example, people would like to have their
separate bathrooms, specially Indians, suddenly

00:27:05.205 --> 00:27:10.305
they have become Britishers and Britishers
have become Indians you know.

00:27:10.305 --> 00:27:16.765
Indians want to have their separate bathrooms
- I don’t know why, and uh, this is a very

00:27:16.765 --> 00:27:19.315
common disease with Indians.

00:27:19.315 --> 00:27:25.175
And it is also spreading to other people I
feel sometimes that they want to have their

00:27:25.175 --> 00:27:28.035
separate bathrooms.

00:27:28.035 --> 00:27:30.645
In a collective life there is no need.

00:27:30.645 --> 00:27:37.655
You don’t even know, if you ask me I won’t
even know if I have been to bathroom or not,

00:27:37.655 --> 00:27:40.115
just go there come back, finished.

00:27:40.115 --> 00:27:45.575
I have no time for all that.

00:27:45.575 --> 00:27:55.385
In the same way you also should have a concept
of a society which is living like a ocean,

00:27:55.385 --> 00:28:00.195
if ocean rises they rise, it falls they fall
- just one [unison?

00:28:00.195 --> 00:28:01.195
union?

00:28:01.195 --> 00:28:03.145
Sounds like "unigon"] of Love.

00:28:03.145 --> 00:28:13.415
I am expecting that kind of a society at the
foothill of Himalayas, and I am sure you all

00:28:13.415 --> 00:28:20.565
of you realise that Himalaya being the Sahasrara
of the world.

00:28:20.565 --> 00:28:29.205
Luckily I wanted it to be done before the
Sahasrara Puja and it is done, with the blessings

00:28:29.205 --> 00:28:31.815
of Himalayas I should say.

00:28:31.815 --> 00:28:39.865
The Himalaya is also like the Sahasrara where
the Kundalini has risen, where the vibrations

00:28:39.865 --> 00:28:44.985
have come out, and in the sky you can see
the vibrations.

00:28:44.985 --> 00:28:56.415
But this Himalaya is ruled by a wrathful God
called Shiva - that’s the dangerous part

00:28:56.415 --> 00:28:58.235
of it.

00:28:58.235 --> 00:29:02.795
So we have to be very, very careful.

00:29:02.795 --> 00:29:17.945
If we try to play around, if we try to
take to hatred among ourselves, take to divisive

00:29:17.945 --> 00:29:28.545
methods, take to something that is not Sahaj,
this wrathful God is sitting on our head.

00:29:28.545 --> 00:29:34.835
He’s also in Mecca, this is Mecaisha Shiv
there.

00:29:34.835 --> 00:29:40.455
If you try to misbehave he comes out with
his wrathfulness.

00:29:40.455 --> 00:29:47.145
Anywhere where you are you have to be very
careful that this Shiva is everywhere.

00:29:47.145 --> 00:29:59.896
Like one of these Lingas of Shiva is in [Perlybaithnath?],
that is in Maharastra, Alahathur, and there

00:29:59.896 --> 00:30:07.825
people started another kind of Sahaja Yoga,
also they were drinking on the day of the

00:30:07.825 --> 00:30:22.145
Shri Ganesha’s celebrations, so the wrath
of Shivalinga came and there was such a big,

00:30:22.145 --> 00:30:24.865
huge earthquake.

00:30:24.865 --> 00:30:35.135
Many people were lost but none of the Sahaja
Yogis, and their centre was saved completely.

00:30:35.135 --> 00:30:41.895
Now we had a big fire also as you know last
time and nothing happened to you, you are

00:30:41.895 --> 00:30:43.235
under protection.

00:30:43.235 --> 00:30:46.205
You are all the time protected.

00:30:46.205 --> 00:30:52.315
There was no wrath of Shiva that could work
out anything.

00:30:52.315 --> 00:30:56.035
Fire could not do anything to you because
you are under protection.

00:30:56.035 --> 00:31:00.915
But this protection is your Mother’s love.

00:31:00.915 --> 00:31:07.755
It’s not anything else but the love of your
Mother, which is very powerful, and which

00:31:07.755 --> 00:31:10.985
is protecting you and helping you.

00:31:10.985 --> 00:31:18.174
In the same way you develop that kind of love
for others, for other Sahaja Yogis, for other

00:31:18.174 --> 00:31:23.615
people, for other things, for this Mother
earth, for all that.

00:31:23.615 --> 00:31:31.555
Your love can not only protect you but protect
others also.

00:31:31.555 --> 00:31:37.935
Your attention as long as it is on yourself
will start becoming smaller and smaller.

00:31:37.935 --> 00:31:43.425
I should have this, I should have that, I
like this, I like that.

00:31:43.425 --> 00:31:46.685
All these topics will fall.

00:31:46.685 --> 00:31:51.855
You’ll never say ‘I like this’.

00:31:51.855 --> 00:31:54.115
No question.

00:31:54.115 --> 00:31:55.185
What do I like?

00:31:55.185 --> 00:32:03.815
It is difficult for me to decide if I like
anything - this I like, that I like, I like

00:32:03.815 --> 00:32:05.735
to be this way.

00:32:05.735 --> 00:32:06.775
Who are you?

00:32:06.775 --> 00:32:10.265
Ask yourself the question.

00:32:10.265 --> 00:32:12.815
Who are you?

00:32:12.815 --> 00:32:22.815
If you are the pure spirit it is nothing but
love, and in love you think of others, the

00:32:22.815 --> 00:32:30.085
problems of others, you try to make others
comfortable, you try to look after others

00:32:30.085 --> 00:32:35.535
and you don’t just look after yourself and
bother about yourself.

00:32:35.535 --> 00:32:37.635
This is what you have to reach.

00:32:37.635 --> 00:32:43.595
Though you may be dharmic, you may be in every
way Sahaj, but still, unless and until you

00:32:43.595 --> 00:32:53.025
reach that state in your Sahasrara, I wouldn’t
say that you are alright.

00:32:53.025 --> 00:32:54.885
You have to work it out.

00:32:54.885 --> 00:33:02.415
For that, of course, meditation is very important,
but the thing that stops it is your mind.

00:33:02.415 --> 00:33:06.215
It's your mind that goes on telling you.

00:33:06.215 --> 00:33:10.255
All the time you watch your mind how it tries
to guide you.

00:33:10.255 --> 00:33:17.695
How it tries to tell you - now what about
me, what about my house, what about my children,

00:33:17.695 --> 00:33:20.965
what about my country.

00:33:20.965 --> 00:33:27.275
Like that you go on ‘my, my, my, my, my’
- ultimately you end up into nothing.

00:33:27.275 --> 00:33:34.145
But when you say ‘you, you, you’ - Kabira
has said a beautiful thing about it.

00:33:34.145 --> 00:33:44.595
He says that when the goat is living it is
saying: ‘Meh, meh, meh’ which means I,

00:33:44.595 --> 00:33:45.945
I, I.

00:33:45.945 --> 00:33:54.924
But it dies, then they take out the intestine
and put in on a dunkih, where they put it

00:33:54.924 --> 00:33:58.995
for the cleaning of the cotton.

00:33:58.995 --> 00:34:05.674
And that time what does that dunkih say: ‘Tuhi,
tuhi, tuhi’ - you are the one, you are,

00:34:05.674 --> 00:34:11.725
you are, you are - and that he calls all over.

00:34:11.725 --> 00:34:16.995
In the same way you have to think from other’s
point of view.

00:34:16.995 --> 00:34:24.565
First of all tuhi when you say, you say it
to your Guru or to God that you are - I am

00:34:24.565 --> 00:34:31.485
no more, I am dissolved, I am finished, I
have become one with this ocean of love.

00:34:31.485 --> 00:34:41.245
And then you say to others: ‘you are, you
are’ that is Sahaj Culture.

00:34:41.245 --> 00:34:50.095
See, so lots of falsehood will follow - falsehood
that surrenders you and others.

00:34:50.095 --> 00:34:58.695
Like people try falsehood by saying something
‘I love you very much’ and on the back

00:34:58.695 --> 00:35:01.665
they plan something very bad.

00:35:01.665 --> 00:35:04.424
They can do anything.

00:35:04.424 --> 00:35:08.935
Not Sahaja Yogis they don’t do it, I must
say, that they have reached the stage where

00:35:08.935 --> 00:35:10.425
they don’t do it.

00:35:10.425 --> 00:35:14.535
But still if they don’t do it they are conscious
of it.

00:35:14.535 --> 00:35:22.415
All the time they are conscious, we don’t
do this, we don’t drink - so what, we don’t

00:35:22.415 --> 00:35:24.025
fuss about food.

00:35:24.025 --> 00:35:30.755
I mean all their things they have achieved
they are very proud of it, you see very proud

00:35:30.755 --> 00:35:34.005
- that we are like this, we are that.

00:35:34.005 --> 00:35:41.555
You see, because you are the pure spirit,
because you are that, so you have become that.

00:35:41.555 --> 00:35:45.735
How can you take pride in something what you
are?

00:35:45.735 --> 00:35:50.815
Like somebody asked me: don’t you feel very
proud that you are the Adi Shakti?

00:35:50.815 --> 00:35:54.565
I said ‘What?’

00:35:54.565 --> 00:35:56.455
I couldn’t understand the question.

00:35:56.455 --> 00:36:02.226
I said see now, if I am Adi Shakti what is
there to be proud, because I am that, what

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.865
is there to be proud?

00:36:03.865 --> 00:36:09.915
If I was not that then I would be proud of
it, but I was, so what is there to be proud

00:36:09.915 --> 00:36:10.985
of.

00:36:10.985 --> 00:36:18.515
Like the sun, it shines, it’s not proud
that ‘I am the sun’, or if you are born,

00:36:18.515 --> 00:36:27.495
say, with your eyes and nose, a face like
a human being, you are not proud: I'm a human

00:36:27.495 --> 00:36:30.885
being, I'm a human being - are you proud?

00:36:30.885 --> 00:36:39.664
In the same way if you are that what you are,
you are not proud, you are not conscious of

00:36:39.664 --> 00:36:42.865
it, not at all conscious.

00:36:42.865 --> 00:36:46.785
I mean, I never tell myself I am Adi Shakti,
there’s no need to tell.

00:36:46.785 --> 00:36:48.385
But it is so, what to do.

00:36:48.385 --> 00:36:53.935
Now God has chosen me, I should say, to be
Adi Shakti, alright, I can have it.

00:36:53.935 --> 00:36:59.715
But I just don’t know what is there - as
if like some people think that, Sahaja Yoga

00:36:59.715 --> 00:37:06.895
has been bestowed upon them like some Lordship
or something like that.

00:37:06.895 --> 00:37:16.585
It is what you have become - when you become,
you must understand that you have become that.

00:37:16.585 --> 00:37:26.424
Like supposing a stone becomes gold, then
it is gold, it won’t be proud that ‘I’m

00:37:26.424 --> 00:37:27.424
gold’ - gold is gold.

00:37:27.424 --> 00:37:30.745
Why will it be proud of that?

00:37:30.745 --> 00:37:40.115
In the same way this consciousness of being
a Sahaja Yogi drops off.

00:37:40.115 --> 00:37:46.635
Still it lingers - so one has to be careful
that once you are a Sahaja Yogi, you are a

00:37:46.635 --> 00:37:48.275
Sahaja Yogi - so what.

00:37:48.275 --> 00:37:53.205
I am a Sahaji , so what, nothing so great.

00:37:53.205 --> 00:38:00.095
It’s like saying that I have a nose, you
see, and be proud of saying I have a nose.

00:38:00.095 --> 00:38:05.794
Nose is already there, what is there to be
proud of - But this pride has to go.

00:38:05.794 --> 00:38:13.674
That’s very important to realise that I’m
not there, I’m no more - I’m one of the

00:38:13.674 --> 00:38:20.794
whole - become the ocean this drop of mine
- I don’t know if there are any boundaries

00:38:20.794 --> 00:38:22.345
left in me.

00:38:22.345 --> 00:38:28.725
This kind of consciousness develops in you,
when your consciousness is filled with joy

00:38:28.725 --> 00:38:35.395
- just with joy and bubbling with love - bubbling
with love.

00:38:35.395 --> 00:38:46.264
You go on see expressing your love, whether
you talk or you don’t talk, whether you

00:38:46.264 --> 00:38:56.575
say about it or you don’t, whether you are
smiling or not, this joy is in your heart.

00:38:56.575 --> 00:39:10.325
Now the Heart Chakra here, the pita of the
Heart Chakra, gets filled with light of truth,

00:39:10.325 --> 00:39:18.575
but the truth is not such an absurd thing
that we know of as truth is.

00:39:18.575 --> 00:39:22.135
For somebody asked me what is the truth.

00:39:22.135 --> 00:39:32.125
So I said that it was written long time back,
that you should speak the truth and speak

00:39:32.125 --> 00:39:39.265
something that people will like - Satjamvadeth
priyamvadeth.

00:39:39.265 --> 00:39:43.145
Then people said, how can you make this truth.

00:39:43.145 --> 00:39:51.195
Truth may not be palatable and could be something
that you say which people like, and may be

00:39:51.195 --> 00:39:55.715
false, so how to make these two things meet.

00:39:55.715 --> 00:40:04.875
So Krishna gave a very good answer, He said
it’s like this: Satyamvadeth, hitamvadeth,

00:40:04.875 --> 00:40:05.875
primamvadeth.

00:40:05.875 --> 00:40:13.435
You say the truth, truth you must say, but
that truth should be good, or should be liked

00:40:13.435 --> 00:40:22.045
or should be appreciated or should be nourishing
for your spirit, by which there is benevolence

00:40:22.045 --> 00:40:28.565
which creates benevolence, and then it has
to be priya.

00:40:28.565 --> 00:40:35.035
In the beginning, people may not like and
say that ‘he said horrible things to me’

00:40:35.035 --> 00:40:43.165
or whatever it is - but at the end of it he’ll
say that see, it’s so good that this was

00:40:43.165 --> 00:40:47.135
said to me that I have done something perfect.

00:40:47.135 --> 00:40:54.825
But in any case there is no need to say something
very harsh or hard to anyone.

00:40:54.825 --> 00:41:00.955
That is not your job to go on correcting all
the rest of the people.

00:41:00.955 --> 00:41:05.715
To begin with, many Sahaja Yogis, I have seen,
have been saying: you’ve got this chakra

00:41:05.715 --> 00:41:07.915
caught up, you’ve got that chakra caught
up.

00:41:07.915 --> 00:41:11.625
All this is the play of ego.

00:41:11.625 --> 00:41:16.685
You have no business to condemn anyone, you
have come from such a condemned condition

00:41:16.685 --> 00:41:19.915
yourself, so why are you condemning others.

00:41:19.915 --> 00:41:27.155
Only thing is if you are capable, if you are
equipped, if you are matured enough in Sahaja

00:41:27.155 --> 00:41:35.345
Yoga, then you will just take it up as a great
challenge of love and you will do it.

00:41:35.345 --> 00:41:39.786
But you won’t go on condemning that person,
finding faults with that person, it’s a

00:41:39.786 --> 00:41:44.515
very good excuse if you don’t want to do
it.

00:41:44.515 --> 00:41:50.495
Supposing somebody is sick and the doctor
doesn’t know how to cure, so what does he

00:41:50.495 --> 00:41:51.495
do?

00:41:51.495 --> 00:41:57.305
He says you see you are sick because this
happened, because you went in the cold.

00:41:57.305 --> 00:42:03.105
Because this haribaba yes, but now I am sick
so now what about curing me.

00:42:03.105 --> 00:42:08.225
No, because you did this, because you did
that, you should not have done this.

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:11.125
All about the past mistakes, he’ll go on.

00:42:11.125 --> 00:42:17.835
In the same way we go on: that you did like
this, you were like this, you went to the

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:23.085
falara guru, you did this kind of a mistake,
that’s why you are like this.

00:42:23.085 --> 00:42:28.065
No, don’t tell him anything, just work it
out and it works.

00:42:28.065 --> 00:42:34.724
Of course, you can ask if he has been to some
guru, but don’t condemn, don’t criticise,

00:42:34.724 --> 00:42:40.635
there is no need to condemn anybody for what
mistakes they have committed.

00:42:40.635 --> 00:42:45.895
This is all coming from the consciousness
that you are better equipped, that you have

00:42:45.895 --> 00:42:47.345
all the knowledge.

00:42:47.345 --> 00:42:53.835
You have, you are very knowledge people, I
must say very knowledgable.

00:42:53.835 --> 00:43:03.435
You are the gnostics, all that I accept, but
as long as you are aware of it you are not.

00:43:03.435 --> 00:43:12.055
Once you are not aware of it then you are
that what is called Sahaja Yogi.

00:43:12.055 --> 00:43:18.885
So I would expect all of you to have this
new development in their Sahasrara, in your

00:43:18.885 --> 00:43:21.915
Sahasrara, in everybody’s Sahasrara.

00:43:21.915 --> 00:43:23.815
We have to think of the whole world.

00:43:23.815 --> 00:43:27.866
We cannot just think of Sahaja Yogis and also
about the seekers.

00:43:27.866 --> 00:43:32.456
Seekers are there, alright, but what about
the rest.

00:43:32.456 --> 00:43:36.505
There are so many problems there and so many
things are to be done.

00:43:36.505 --> 00:43:42.045
For example, now we have a problem in India
of poverty.

00:43:42.045 --> 00:43:44.835
So I am trying to do something for them.

00:43:44.835 --> 00:43:47.715
You have problems in your countries.

00:43:47.715 --> 00:43:50.695
You should find out what problems there are.

00:43:50.695 --> 00:43:57.224
You can start some sort of a movement for
them, try to help them as far as possible.

00:43:57.224 --> 00:44:04.105
It’s not missionary like, that you convert
somebody for some sort of a reward or for

00:44:04.105 --> 00:44:09.665
some name you have to do - you just do it
for your pleasure, because it’s your pleasure

00:44:09.665 --> 00:44:10.815
to do it.

00:44:10.815 --> 00:44:15.645
That’s how you'll go to the society and
you won’t be afraid that you'll be caught

00:44:15.645 --> 00:44:16.645
up.

00:44:16.645 --> 00:44:22.224
I know of one couple, when I asked them, why
don’t you start working it out.

00:44:22.224 --> 00:44:25.315
So they said ‘Mother we are afraid our ego
will come back’.

00:44:25.315 --> 00:44:30.225
They are afraid of themselves only - their
ego will come back.

00:44:30.225 --> 00:44:36.695
So all these problems should be dropped out
and you should reach that state where you

00:44:36.695 --> 00:44:43.065
don’t have all these fears, all these non-sensical
ideas about yourself.

00:44:43.065 --> 00:44:45.175
You are powerful.

00:44:45.175 --> 00:44:47.185
You have powers.

00:44:47.185 --> 00:44:51.055
Not only that, but you have been specially
bestowed with those powers.

00:44:51.055 --> 00:44:54.685
But if you don’t want use it then what are
you?

00:44:54.685 --> 00:45:02.415
If the lamp is not enlightened what is this
lamp for - just for decoration?

00:45:02.415 --> 00:45:09.214
So this has to be used, and this has to be
used without feeling that awareness within

00:45:09.214 --> 00:45:16.295
you that you are something great, better than
others, something selected, or also they say

00:45:16.295 --> 00:45:20.185
that we are chosen.

00:45:20.185 --> 00:45:27.305
So, this can spread very fast with such grace
and understanding.

00:45:27.305 --> 00:45:32.465
All kinds of stupid people are there, it’s
alright, you know they are stupid - just laugh

00:45:32.465 --> 00:45:37.415
at them, make fun of them and that’s how
you can solve the problem.

00:45:37.415 --> 00:45:43.795
But even that, you should do it in such a
way that you don’t hurt them, that whatever

00:45:43.795 --> 00:45:48.885
you do you should see from the results what
works out.

00:45:48.885 --> 00:46:01.085
Results should be such that you should see,
how it works out.

00:46:01.085 --> 00:46:05.575
With some people - that’s the intelligence,
I think that’s the superior intelligence

00:46:05.575 --> 00:46:12.255
by which you know how to say things, what
to say things and how to work it out.

00:46:12.255 --> 00:46:22.585
Love, this Divine Love, gives you a complete
control over yourself, and you know everything,

00:46:22.585 --> 00:46:28.745
how to behave, how to talk to people, how
to manage them.

00:46:28.745 --> 00:46:36.695
I don’t know what is the worst thing among
human beings.

00:46:36.695 --> 00:46:47.185
According to Krishna it was temper - hot temper
was the worst thing, but according to me it

00:46:47.185 --> 00:46:51.385
is jealousy.

00:46:51.385 --> 00:46:58.075
Jealousy of any kind is absolutely, I should
say, like a scum.

00:46:58.075 --> 00:47:06.405
In Sahaja Yoga also people feel jealous and
they may not say so because I don’t like

00:47:06.405 --> 00:47:14.245
it, but they may create problem, they may
try to create problem among each other.

00:47:14.245 --> 00:47:20.595
So one thing you should have a watch on your
mind if there is any kind of jealousy.

00:47:20.595 --> 00:47:28.125
I’m rather worried sometimes - supposing
I want to give some present to some people,

00:47:28.125 --> 00:47:35.175
then I’m worried that I shouldn’t do something
that will create jealousy.

00:47:35.175 --> 00:47:39.175
We should not.

00:47:39.175 --> 00:47:46.155
Mother might have forgotten, or it’s alright
she’s running short of it - it’s alright.

00:47:46.155 --> 00:47:53.835
But people have that kind of a very sharp
sense of jealousy when in Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:53.835 --> 00:47:59.605
Now supposing I meet somebody and I don’t
meet somebody else - finished.

00:47:59.605 --> 00:48:04.865
That person developes a jealousy for that
person whom I meet.

00:48:04.865 --> 00:48:08.785
Sometimes people pester me too much - ‘Mother,
I must meet you, I must meet you’.

00:48:08.785 --> 00:48:11.535
I don’t know why, why do you want to meet
me.

00:48:11.535 --> 00:48:17.135
I’m all over, everywhere as you say.

00:48:17.135 --> 00:48:22.665
Then what is the need that you should meet
me and talk to me - what is the need?

00:48:22.665 --> 00:48:30.195
It’s not for you alone I am, I’m for everyone,
but some people think that they have a special

00:48:30.195 --> 00:48:37.565
right on me and they think that I must meet
them indivdually, otherwise they feel very

00:48:37.565 --> 00:48:38.565
bad.

00:48:38.565 --> 00:48:46.405
All these things have to go away in a big
way when you become as I said, the ocean.

00:48:46.405 --> 00:48:53.695
Then you are not bothered what shore you go,
where you travel, you are not bothered, you

00:48:53.695 --> 00:48:57.705
are only with the ocean moving up and down.

00:48:57.705 --> 00:49:06.175
That is how it’s a living ocean of love,
and that’s what we have to develop it- without

00:49:06.175 --> 00:49:12.695
dominating others, without showing off.

00:49:12.695 --> 00:49:20.705
It should be, the whole thing should be contented
within ourself.

00:49:20.705 --> 00:49:29.825
In Hindi it is said better: Apneme ...(hindi...ndt).

00:49:29.825 --> 00:49:38.775
Should be all within yourself and that’s
the most enjoyable thing.

00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:47.355
Because see what we want, supposing I want
something for myself, you see, so I’ll strive

00:49:47.355 --> 00:49:48.835
and get it.

00:49:48.835 --> 00:49:58.705
But this is something if you have within yourself,
you fully filled within yourself.

00:49:58.705 --> 00:50:03.745
So what is most important, what is so much
needed?

00:50:03.745 --> 00:50:05.535
Nothing!

00:50:05.535 --> 00:50:18.915
You are completely filled with yourself, contented
with yourself, and then you want to share.

00:50:18.915 --> 00:50:28.555
This is the ideal way of dealing with Sahasrara,
I think, and I am sure the day will come this

00:50:28.555 --> 00:50:35.135
whole world’s Sahasrara has to be opened
out.

00:50:35.135 --> 00:50:41.425
This is what we have to do it, and we are
not going to disappear into some exclusive

00:50:41.425 --> 00:50:49.815
places that is just for meditation - you can
go there, but not for escaping the world.

00:50:49.815 --> 00:50:51.375
That is not the idea.

00:50:51.375 --> 00:50:59.385
Idea is for meditation, for your growth - it
would be a nice place to go to.

00:50:59.385 --> 00:51:16.085
It is very important to understand how valuable
you are, how remarkably important you are

00:51:16.085 --> 00:51:25.055
- born at this time, got your realisation
for what?

00:51:25.055 --> 00:51:36.214
To emancipate this world, to transform human
beings, to take whole of this world into the

00:51:36.214 --> 00:51:37.785
realm of God.

00:51:37.785 --> 00:51:40.345
That is what you are here for.

00:51:40.435 --> 00:51:42.405
May God bless you.
