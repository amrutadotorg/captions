1
00:00:04,592 --> 00:00:12,279
Now we are facing little children.

2
00:00:12,526 --> 00:00:20,148
They are the ones who are incarnations.

3
00:00:21,937 --> 00:00:27,751
They are the ones who are going
to lead humanity

4
00:00:27,952 --> 00:00:36,911
into some great advancement –

5
00:00:37,112 --> 00:00:42,870
the humanity has to be looked after.

6
00:00:43,076 --> 00:00:49,244
They are tomorrow’s humanity.
And we are today’s.

7
00:00:49,445 --> 00:00:55,933
And what are we giving to them
for them to follow?

8
00:00:56,134 --> 00:01:01,131
What is their aim in life?

9
00:01:02,284 --> 00:01:05,910
Very, very difficult to say.

10
00:01:06,111 --> 00:01:14,733
But with the Sahaja Yoga they will
all go in the proper way,

11
00:01:14,934 --> 00:01:17,996
 they’ll behave in a proper way

12
00:01:18,196 --> 00:01:26,847
and the whole thing will be a different
mass of Sahaja Yogis coming up.

13
00:01:27,048 --> 00:01:33,294
But it is the duty of bigger Sahaja Yogis
to look after them;

14
00:01:33,495 --> 00:01:38,804
to have better moral standards,
to have better lives

15
00:01:39,005 --> 00:01:48,760
so that they follow your life and become
genuinely good Sahaja Yogis.

16
00:01:48,961 --> 00:01:56,963
It’s a very big responsibility, perhaps
we don’t recognise it, we don’t understand,

17
00:01:57,164 --> 00:02:08,552
but all these are little creatures
which are after the image

18
00:02:08,753 --> 00:02:16,300
of great souls and they should be
brought up in that way,

19
00:02:16,501 --> 00:02:24,315
respected in that manner and loved
with great care.

20
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:32,296
This is to be understood. The problem
with our elderly people is this,

21
00:02:32,497 --> 00:02:38,194
that we do not consider them
to be considered,

22
00:02:38,424 --> 00:02:45,554
to be bothered about, to be understood
about. We think we are too intelligent,

23
00:02:45,755 --> 00:02:50,791
too good and we need not waste
our energy with them.

24
00:02:50,992 --> 00:02:54,691
This is the trouble of the elderly
people.

25
00:02:54,892 --> 00:03:02,351
But today when we are sitting here
to worship Shri Ganesha,

26
00:03:02,552 --> 00:03:06,833
we should know they are all incarnations
of Shri Ganesha

27
00:03:07,034 --> 00:03:15,724
and they should be given proper attention,
proper understanding about themselves.

28
00:03:15,925 --> 00:03:25,663
I find certain amount of children who are
very well-behaved, which are very sensible,

29
00:03:25,864 --> 00:03:31,751
and there are some who have no idea
as to what they are doing.

30
00:03:31,952 --> 00:03:38,157
So it is the duty of the elders to put
ideas into their head,

31
00:03:38,358 --> 00:03:44,189
to proper understanding about themselves
and the self-respect.

32
00:03:44,389 --> 00:03:50,882
Same thing I would say for the elder
Sahaja Yogis

33
00:03:51,082 --> 00:03:55,801
who have to look after their younger
brothers and sisters.

34
00:03:56,001 --> 00:04:01,839
In this family of ours which we call
as Sahaja Yogis,

35
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:08,334
there are all kinds of people, all types,
all behaviours.

36
00:04:08,534 --> 00:04:15,802
Of course, they should not be regimented,
there should not be uniformity,

37
00:04:16,003 --> 00:04:19,520
but in that variety there should be
with beauty,

38
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:27,249
there should be beautiful trend of being
one with each other.

39
00:04:27,449 --> 00:04:32,024
For that, what should we do,
is the problem.

40
00:04:32,225 --> 00:04:36,705
What should the elders do to achieve that?

41
00:04:36,905 --> 00:04:44,990
What is our solid contribution
to their lives?

42
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:56,981
The first will be to tell them who is
Shri Ganesha,

43
00:04:57,568 --> 00:05:05,360
and that what are the qualities of Ganesha,
what does He represent.

44
00:05:05,561 --> 00:05:11,326
What does He represent, what qualities
He has.

45
00:05:11,526 --> 00:05:17,564
And once they start understanding, that
though being a little boy,

46
00:05:17,765 --> 00:05:24,444
He’s so generous, He’s so kind,
He’s so forgiving,

47
00:05:24,645 --> 00:05:29,822
they’ll be amazed because they are
also small

48
00:05:30,023 --> 00:05:35,481
and they’ll also take to that kind of life.

49
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:41,825
I find some children very sensible,
very good here.

50
00:05:42,025 --> 00:05:48,073
Some are naughty and some don’t understand
what we are doing here.

51
00:05:48,274 --> 00:05:52,776
Whatever it is, they are after all
children.

52
00:05:52,977 --> 00:05:59,287
And what you have to do is to look
after them, respect them,

53
00:05:59,487 --> 00:06:07,779
and give them the full idea about
Shri Ganesha.

54
00:06:08,018 --> 00:06:15,703
I think everybody must have a statue
of Shri Ganesha in your house,

55
00:06:15,903 --> 00:06:21,457
so the children will see it and ask,
“Who is He? What is He doing here?”

56
00:06:21,658 --> 00:06:25,677
And you’ll be amazed how they will
understand Him,

57
00:06:25,878 --> 00:06:31,520
how they will understand His qualities
and how they will work it out.

58
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:39,002
It is important for all of you to have
at least one Shri Ganesha in your house,

59
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:45,453
so that you can tell your children that,
‘You all have to become like Him’.

60
00:06:45,653 --> 00:06:50,163
Now what are the qualities of Shri Ganesha?

61
00:06:50,364 --> 00:06:54,513
They won’t understand chastity,
they are too small,

62
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,179
they won’t understand all those qualities.

63
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:07,968
But one quality they will understand
is to be honest. Is to be honest.

64
00:07:27,305 --> 00:07:36,173
Gradually you’ll find all difficult ones
will go down, it will work out that way.

65
00:07:36,374 --> 00:07:42,013
Because you see, they don’t understand
My lecture,

66
00:07:42,214 --> 00:07:45,246
they don’t understand what I am saying.

67
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:53,183
But one thing is there, if there are some
oppositions within, they will show –

68
00:07:53,384 --> 00:07:59,468
show very well – because they are
so innocent and so simple,

69
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:07,898
their innocence will help them to expose
them to reality.

70
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:14,727
I hope you all look after your children,
guide them properly

71
00:08:14,928 --> 00:08:27,820
and take them to a level of understanding
that they understand what is their position,

72
00:08:28,021 --> 00:08:33,478
what qualities they should have,
why will they be respected.

73
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:40,245
You’ll be amazed, that their behaviour
will change

74
00:08:40,446 --> 00:08:44,857
the behaviour of all the other children.

75
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:53,062
What I have to say that nobody should think
that you are very grown-up

76
00:08:53,263 --> 00:08:58,473
because you can keep quiet, sit quietly
and all that, no.

77
00:08:58,674 --> 00:09:05,630
You are grown-up only if you can imbibe
the qualities of Shri Ganesha.

78
00:09:05,831 --> 00:09:12,581
I have seen people who are very grown-up
still do not have simple qualities

79
00:09:12,782 --> 00:09:17,952
of chastity, of honesty.

80
00:09:18,153 --> 00:09:25,285
They don’t have, and they can’t have,
because they don’t think it is important.

81
00:09:25,486 --> 00:09:34,017
So, I leave it to you to find out
Shri Ganesha within yourself.

82
00:09:37,286 --> 00:09:42,444
I enjoy their company because
they are so innocent

83
00:09:42,645 --> 00:09:51,185
and so simple-hearted and I like them
very, very much.

84
00:09:59,632 --> 00:10:07,652
So, you should not get afraid or frightened
of their mischief.

85
00:10:07,817 --> 00:10:13,493
On the contrary, you should know
they deserve much more love,

86
00:10:13,693 --> 00:10:20,589
much more understanding and much more
scope to grow.

87
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:27,143
I hope by the time they will be of your age,
they’ll be great Sahaja Yogis.

88
00:10:27,343 --> 00:10:30,562
They’ll understand what we are doing here.

89
00:10:30,768 --> 00:10:38,149
I had to face mountains of nonsense
with the older people,

90
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:45,223
but these won’t have that. They’ll be
very simple, very sweet

91
00:10:45,424 --> 00:10:49,160
and they’ll understand love.

92
00:10:50,398 --> 00:10:54,774
So I would say we can allow these children
to go out and play

93
00:10:54,974 --> 00:11:01,036
and somebody can look after them,
so that you’ll be at peace.

94
00:11:06,185 --> 00:11:09,283
Who can take them out?

95
00:11:33,485 --> 00:11:40,100
You can give Me flowers. If you have got
flowers, I’ll take them.

96
00:11:48,898 --> 00:11:51,377
Thank you.

97
00:11:52,723 --> 00:11:55,908
Thank you very much.

98
00:11:57,168 --> 00:12:02,348
What is it? Boy: Chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate.

99
00:12:02,549 --> 00:12:05,175
Boy: Yes, chocolate.
Pujari: Chocolate. Chocolate, Shri Mataji.

100
00:12:05,376 --> 00:12:09,110
Thank you. Thank you very much.

101
00:12:14,839 --> 00:12:17,451
Thank you.

102
00:12:59,838 --> 00:13:02,512
Thank you.

103
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:06,308
Thank you.

104
00:13:19,709 --> 00:13:22,550
Avinash: Can we have some volunteers?
Please, take the children out.

105
00:13:22,751 --> 00:13:24,801
Shri Mataji would like the children
to play outside.

106
00:13:25,002 --> 00:13:28,705
Can we have some mothers, some aunties
if they can please take them out?

107
00:13:28,971 --> 00:13:31,852
So we can proceed, please.

108
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:35,936
Any volunteers, anyone?

109
00:13:36,563 --> 00:13:38,888
If Yuva Shakti...
