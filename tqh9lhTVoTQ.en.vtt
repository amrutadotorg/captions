00:00:07.008 --> 00:00:10.114
Now, I think, we should have questions first.

00:00:11.362 --> 00:00:15.274
What is Self-realization and how do You grant it?

00:00:18.204 --> 00:00:32.131
Self-realization is the epitome of our&nbsp;
evolutionary process, which is a living process&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.207
through which you achieve your higher Self.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.951
Even Darwin, who was an atheist,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:40.951 --> 00:00:49.714
did say that as human beings have come&nbsp;
so far they will achieve their absolute.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.616
So, to achieve your absolute&nbsp;
means to get Self-realization.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.937
The purpose of our life, the meaning of our life&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:00:58.842 --> 00:01:07.234
is only achieved when we will get connected&nbsp;
with the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:13.233
Now, one need not believe in the Divine&nbsp;
Power, but you can see the manifestation&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:19.767
of this living Divine Power when&nbsp;
you see a flower becoming a fruit.

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:23.931
All living work is done by this Divine Power.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.980
But we are not aware of it.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:29.043
At this human stage we are not aware of it.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.040
But once this happening takes&nbsp;
place in your awareness … it’s&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.420
not just suggesting that you become&nbsp;
something great or on … on mental level,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.077
but actualization of this experience is felt in&nbsp;
your awareness, on your central nervous system.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.581
You can feel that you have become&nbsp;
— again I say, you have become,&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.222
not told or brainwashed, but you&nbsp;
have become — collectively conscious.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:06.194
Is a state where you can feel&nbsp;
your Self inside and others’ too.
