Now, I think, we should have questions first.

00:11.362 --> 00:15.274
What is Self-realization and how do You grant it?

00:18.204 --> 00:32.131
Self-realization is the epitome of our
evolutionary process, which is a living process

00:32.460 --> 00:36.207
through which you achieve your higher Self.

00:37.740 --> 00:40.951
Even Darwin, who was an atheist,

00:40.951 --> 00:49.714
did say that as human beings have come
so far they will achieve their absolute.

00:49.980 --> 00:53.616
So, to achieve your absolute
means to get Self-realization.

00:54.240 --> 00:57.937
The purpose of our life, the meaning of our life

00:58.842 --> 01:07.234
is only achieved when we will get connected
with the Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

01:08.133 --> 01:13.233
Now, one need not believe in the Divine
Power, but you can see the manifestation

01:13.233 --> 01:19.767
of this living Divine Power when
you see a flower becoming a fruit.

01:19.889 --> 01:23.931
All living work is done by this Divine Power.

01:24.060 --> 01:25.980
But we are not aware of it.

01:25.980 --> 01:29.043
At this human stage we are not aware of it.

01:29.580 --> 01:35.040
But once this happening takes
place in your awareness … it’s

01:35.040 --> 01:39.420
not just suggesting that you become
something great or on … on mental level,

01:39.420 --> 01:47.077
but actualization of this experience is felt in
your awareness, on your central nervous system.

01:47.400 --> 01:51.581
You can feel that you have become
— again I say, you have become,

01:51.840 --> 01:57.222
not told or brainwashed, but you
have become — collectively conscious.

01:57.720 --> 02:06.194
Is a state where you can feel
your Self inside and others’ too.
