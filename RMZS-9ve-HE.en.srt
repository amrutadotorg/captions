1
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:36,040
Today we are going to worship Shri Ganesha.

2
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,360
It is said about him, that

3
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:48,960
He is the first deity that was created on this earth

4
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:57,240
by Adi Shakti.

5
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,800
And about his creation, you know the story.

6
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,880
And also you know

7
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,400
how an elephant´s head was attached to him.

8
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:20,720
Today, I am going to tell something more subtler

9
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:29,600
about him, Kundalini and the Mother Earth.

10
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,080
He was made out of the Mother Earth,

11
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,080
with the vibrations of his Mother.

12
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:48,320
Now, the significance of Mother Earth,

13
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:51,760
we have never understood.

14
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:55,800
Now look at the Mother Earth,

15
00:06:57,040 --> 00:07:02,960
She is the one who produces all kinds of

16
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,120
beautiful flowers of different fragrance,

17
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:15,280
of different nature, color, heights.

18
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,680
The trees are different.

19
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:23,720
Trees, when they grow up,

20
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:29,160
they grow in such a manner that every leaf,

21
00:07:31,040 --> 00:07:35,440
every leaf of that tree, gets the sun.

22
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,160
Look at the collective sense

23
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,400
which is given to us by this Mother Earth.

24
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:49,480
We have never realized that this Mother Earth,

25
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:55,280
which is giving us everything that we want

26
00:07:55,480 --> 00:07:59,040
and the sun helps the Mother Earth,

27
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,760
cooperates, coordinates with Her.

28
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:08,600
To go further with it, you have seen that picture

29
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,840
where the Kundalini is coming out of the Mother Earth,

30
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:17,520
and half of it is seen.

31
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:24,280
So what does this Kundalini do for us?

32
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,240
Or what does this Mother Earth do for us?

33
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:35,480
The Kundalini leaves the Mother Earth as a reflection,

34
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:40,960
and what does She do within us,

35
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:45,960
to build us up in which way?

36
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,600
So it is the primordial power

37
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,560
which is coming out of the Mother Earth.

38
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:59,000
Mother Earth itself acts like a Mother,

39
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,080
She looks after you, She gives you whatever you want,

40
00:09:03,280 --> 00:09:05,600
and another miraculous thing is

41
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:09,240
that the highest tree is a coconut tree,

42
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
and a coconut will never fall

43
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,280
on any creature or any human being.

44
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,960
That means it´s all thinking,

45
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:21,840
all understanding, all consciousness,

46
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:26,160
all awareness is coming from the Mother Earth.

47
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,360
But we never understand.

48
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:33,200
As it is we take it for granted.

49
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:40,160
Now what does She do for us, for us human beings?

50
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:44,640
She´s the primordial power.

51
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:50,440
What she does is to build in us a primordial

52
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:53,240
– what we can call – restrictions

53
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,360
or primordial taboos or primordial dharmas.

54
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,680
For example, you see the steel is here.

55
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,040
It has its own dharma,

56
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,640
it cannot behave like wood.

57
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,120
Wood has its own dharma,

58
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:20,160
it cannot behave like silver.

59
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:27,800
They all have their dharma and they are bound in that dharma.

60
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,760
Everything that is in the nature has its own dharma.

61
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,720
If you see the tiger, if you see the lion,

62
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:41,960
if you see a mongoose or if you see a snake,

63
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:46,440
they all have their dharma, their style, their everything.

64
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:51,440
It´s very surprising, how they are bound by it.

65
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:53,920
Once in Prathisthan,

66
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,760
I went from the other side to my bedroom,

67
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:02,400
and I saw a very big snake came out of a hole.

68
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:04,760
Of course I was quite away from it,

69
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:08,240
but it felt my vibrations and started running away.

70
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:11,880
It fell in the swimming pool and it wouldn´t come out.

71
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:16,400
So somebody went down and killed it

72
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,960
and brought his body up there.

73
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:23,440
I was surprised; it was such a big one, about six feet,

74
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:30,280
but it intertwined itself in a very beautiful pattern,

75
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:34,200
surprisingly, when it was there. Alright.

76
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:39,720
Then what they did, they said that, “Mother, if we leave it,

77
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,840
it will fall in the water and again it will come to life,

78
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,240
so what should we do?

79
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,800
I said “Let it be then. What do you do?"

80
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:53,920
They said “we burn it”. So they burned the snake.

81
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,160
But the female of the snake came out after 10 days.

82
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,440
They said “there must be a female”,

83
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:05,960
and she was searching for him

84
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,800
when suddenly somebody saw her.

85
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,080
They killed her also, they killed her

86
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:16,760
and she also made the same kind of a pattern.

87
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,280
I was amazed,

88
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,200
very beautiful pattern

89
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:24,160
of the body going round, like this, like this, like this.

90
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:28,480
Exactly the same, she also made.

91
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:30,560
So I was surprised

92
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,280
how is it that this lady knows how

93
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:37,600
to copy her husband?

94
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:40,720
She did it, and when we burnt her,

95
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:44,280
she was finished of course, both of them were killed.

96
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:48,920
But what I felt is that animals,

97
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:53,360
creepers, those who creep permanently,

98
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:57,760
other people also, every type of animal,

99
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,560
the whole of biology I studied, I was amazed

100
00:13:03,760 --> 00:13:09,560
that every type of animal has the exact,

101
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:13,760
the same sample of behavior.

102
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,280
For example, you can put the dog in the water

103
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:22,960
he´ll swim, but the cat may not.

104
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:28,200
See it´s a thing that is built in, the dharma,

105
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,440
what I call the primordial taboos.

106
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,400
We have in the same way, primordial taboos

107
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:43,200
built within us, which are dharma.

108
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,640
A human being has to be like that.

109
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,600
If he tries to be something else

110
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,560
something goes wrong with his life.

111
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,360
It´s like say if you, you have a glass,

112
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,760
you drop it on the ground, it will break, that is the dharma.

113
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:05,320
In the same way when human beings

114
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:09,360
start deviating from the line of dharma,

115
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:11,760
they get into trouble.

116
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,480
But it is only human beings who can do that.

117
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:20,240
They can only cross over these taboos, these primordial taboos,

118
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:23,920
and can become horrible.

119
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,320
You see a person,

120
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:30,400
sometimes I wonder what´s wrong with him.

121
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,240
He has a nice home, very good wife, everything,

122
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:41,720
then he has a keep (another woman), what is the need?

123
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,880
For a man it is primordial that he should have

124
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:50,680
only one wife, and she, one husband.

125
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:55,520
It´s a taboo, as soon as you deviate from that

126
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,320
something goes wrong.

127
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:03,240
Now who punishes, or who corrects or who destroys

128
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:10,120
is this primordial power which we call as Paramchaitanya.

129
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:19,200
If you can understand that it´s a structure.

130
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:24,520
Say this is the structure of this hangar,

131
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,520
now you want to break it, you can break it

132
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,320
because you are human beings,

133
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:33,840
but it will be broken.

134
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,720
As simple as that,

135
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,400
we have to understand we are human beings

136
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,800
and we cannot do things

137
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:46,320
which go against our dharma.

138
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:49,160
Now why the dharma?

139
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:54,240
Dharma has to be there for our ascent.

140
00:15:55,640 --> 00:16:00,960
Now man, in his intelligence and his progressiveness

141
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,800
thinks that anything he does – what´s wrong?

142
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:09,440
Especially in the west, this is very common.

143
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:13,080
But I must say, for the aboriginal people,

144
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,640
or people who are,

145
00:16:15,840 --> 00:16:19,240
I mean I don´t know if I should call Indians aboriginal or not.

146
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:23,400
But those people who were made aware

147
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:28,120
of their primordial taboos somehow.

148
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,480
As the animals know what is bad for them

149
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:42,520
and that knowledge was there with aboriginals.

150
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:47,520
Today we are here with Australians,

151
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,080
and in Australia aboriginals are so many

152
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:58,400
I was surprised, most of their words were Sanskrit.

153
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:04,520
So might be they might have got it from India,

154
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,080
or maybe they have gone there from India.

155
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:12,960
So many words they have got which are Sanskrit.

156
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:18,720
So I started thinking about them.

157
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:23,240
Normally aboriginals, say in India we have aboriginals.

158
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:28,760
We call them “gorn, korku, peel”.

159
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,760
We had a lady who was a maid with us,

160
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:36,320
Gaynabai was her name,

161
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:38,440
she was an excellent cook,

162
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,600
but she had her maryadas.

163
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,200
All the time, like if my father came

164
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,760
she would immediately cover her head

165
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:52,120
and go in the other room, to respect him.

166
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,760
Nobody told her to do that.

167
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:04,840
Their marriage system was also very surprisingly good,

168
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,320
and their relationships with the children also was very good.

169
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:12,960
Somehow or another in my childhood I met many of them

170
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:16,280
because I also had a habit of going to the jungles

171
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,440
where I used to meet them

172
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:21,520
and I was surprised, they would not drink

173
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:27,400
this I´m telling you was about 60 years back, maybe more.

174
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,400
They would not drink,

175
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:35,120
very “lajashi” means shame of everything.

176
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:40,760
A matter of, sort of prestige, for them was important.

177
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,040
They would never steal anything,

178
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,960
and I was really very impressed,

179
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,080
how these people were so dharmic,

180
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,520
so good and happy.

181
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,520
They lived in huts, they didn´t mind,

182
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:59,920
but they were very clean and neat people.

183
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:05,880
It is now changed.

184
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,200
The same people have changed so much.

185
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:23,120
I mean they were like sacred people, I tell you, holy people.

186
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,120
They worship Mother,

187
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:31,440
they worship Mother Earth, nothing else,

188
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:35,440
and I asked this lady “why do you worship Mother Earth?”.

189
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,040
She said “she gives us everything.

190
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,440
She is a just Mother,

191
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:44,040
we live in the jungles, she looks after us,

192
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:49,280
and she is the most conscious person,

193
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:54,000
she knows that we are there and she has to look after us”.

194
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:02,480
Even to take out some leaves from the trees,

195
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:06,440
they used to think about it.

196
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,320
But then the missionaries came,

197
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,840
they converted them,

198
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,760
they gave them skirts and blouses

199
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:16,120
and I don´t know what all they did.

200
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,920
But Gaynabai did not take,

201
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:20,000
she said “what is this?”

202
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,360
Why should I wear a dress like this

203
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:24,880
where the whole body is exposed?

204
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,640
No I´ll wear a sari, I can never give it up.

205
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,600
Why should I wear this kind of a useless dress?”

206
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:39,720
But when they met with these so called advanced people

207
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:44,400
so many of them started living like that.

208
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:48,120
They said “you have no freedom;

209
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,880
you are just bound by something, by someone”.

210
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:57,040
But actually they were bound by the sacredness,

211
00:20:57,240 --> 00:21:01,400
by the divine understanding

212
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:05,160
and then they started changing.

213
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:08,200
She was alright, her husband was alright

214
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,640
but her son started drinking,

215
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,720
this is the beginning of the end,

216
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:17,960
then gambling and all other sorts of things he started.

217
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:23,960
Then her grandson started going to prostitutes,

218
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,320
and the idea was only that “we are free,

219
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,960
what´s wrong?”

220
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,320
Now these primordial taboos

221
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,240
are in you, built in. They are there.

222
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:49,320
These are existing maybe in a potential state,

223
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,280
maybe you have curbed them down,

224
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:55,160
maybe you have turned them out,

225
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:58,160
but they are there.

226
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:01,480
All the time they are there,

227
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,160
and that´s what we say that you are leaving the maryadas,

228
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:12,400
or else we say that you are insulting Shri Ganesh.

229
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:17,840
So when Mother created this universe,

230
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:23,280
first deity was Shri Ganesh.

231
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:28,120
Auspiciousness was created.

232
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,320
Now, we don´t understand what is auspiciousness.

233
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:40,000
Auspiciousness is a complete understanding

234
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:52,200
of primordial restrictions, and also of the protocol.

235
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:58,480
For example, in India we all used to do that,

236
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:02,200
though I was in a Christian family,

237
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,760
that before touching the Mother Earth,

238
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,040
getting up from the bed,

239
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,320
we used to say “Oh Mother Earth, please forgive us

240
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:14,640
because we are touching you with our feet”.

241
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:21,440
So respect for the Mother Earth and for nature

242
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,280
is built in within us,

243
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:28,040
it´s part and parcel, we are part and parcel of this whole

244
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:32,960
we can call it whole universe.

245
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:40,400
But when you get into this nonsensical idea of freedom

246
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:45,520
then you are leaving your Mother Earth,

247
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,080
your gravity itself reduces.

248
00:23:51,960 --> 00:23:56,600
This Mother Earth has to teach us,

249
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:59,720
while we are plundering everything,

250
00:23:59,920 --> 00:24:02,880
the ecology, their ecology – ecology people are trying.

251
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,000
Whatever is outside is also inside.

252
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,480
If you want to exploit your Mother inside,

253
00:24:12,680 --> 00:24:16,880
or if you want to trouble your Mother inside,

254
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:21,360
you can also trouble this Mother Earth.

255
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:30,480
Now what has replaced our understanding is very simple,

256
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:42,240
is that we are paying more attention to money.

257
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:48,600
If you can cut a tree you say, to get money,

258
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:52,360
then it is hurting the Mother.

259
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,240
But if you are cutting the tree for beautifying her,

260
00:24:56,440 --> 00:24:58,440
then she´s happy.

261
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:01,920
Her discretion is so great,

262
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:06,280
see the way she produces flowers.

263
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,080
Different, different types of flowers.

264
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:13,520
In different countries, different types of flowers.

265
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:16,160
Like I saw in my country

266
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:19,920
that flowers are extremely fragrant,

267
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,840
very fragrant.

268
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:30,080
And she understands so much.

269
00:25:30,280 --> 00:25:33,600
Once I went to Australia

270
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:37,600
and this flower you call hibiscus,

271
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:43,360
it´s a red flower, it becomes pink and then red,

272
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,400
imagine it becomes first pink

273
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,320
and then gradually it becomes red.

274
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:54,400
Even the sunflower goes on turning its face with the sun.

275
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:57,200
Now how can you say there is no connection

276
00:25:57,400 --> 00:26:01,400
between a sunflower and the sun?

277
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:05,520
Automatically it goes on changing.

278
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:10,920
So these hibiscus flowers are the flowers

279
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,040
which we use to worship Shri Ganesh,

280
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,400
and the program was to worship Shri Ganesh.

281
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:25,960
On the way I saw so many trees of hibiscus, just flowering.

282
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,760
I said “at this time so many flowers”.

283
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:34,600
I said “I think you´d better get these flowers for the puja”.

284
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:40,920
I went and when I arrived in the hall

285
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:46,360
all the Sahaja Yogis had got hibiscus on their own.

286
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:49,480
I never talked to them, just on their own.

287
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:52,760
They didn´t know that it is to be used for Shri Ganesh

288
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:57,600
but the Mother Earth herself created at that time.

289
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:03,880
This is the time of Shri Ganesh when you should get hibiscus.

290
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,560
It´s very remarkable

291
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,800
how the nature is so much within us

292
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,480
and how this, whatever it is within us,

293
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:21,240
guides outside and receives the blessings.

294
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,160
We are not something separate.

295
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:27,600
This Mother Earth is our home,

296
00:27:27,800 --> 00:27:33,720
we have a home in her and she has a home within us.

297
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:38,080
I said today that for Shri Ganesha,

298
00:27:38,280 --> 00:27:40,800
He had a body of the clay,

299
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:43,160
just ordinary clay.

300
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,920
So you can imagine,

301
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,200
if you can really think of it,

302
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:54,400
how this whole universe has created us;

303
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,360
all of it is within us

304
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:03,360
and when we try to hurt something,

305
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:09,440
then we are hurting ourselves.

306
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:15,600
The intelligence of Mother Earth

307
00:28:15,800 --> 00:28:19,120
I have seen from my childhood.

308
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:25,800
It´s such a beautiful thing to know the nature

309
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:27,320
and the Mother Earth

310
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,840
that´s why all the saints, in India especially,

311
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:34,400
used to go and live in the forest.

312
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:38,680
Only in the forest you could see clearly

313
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:47,920
how this primordial bondage was absolutely obeyed,

314
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:52,720
absolutely obeyed, naturally by the nature.

315
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,280
For us it is difficult,

316
00:28:56,480 --> 00:29:02,000
we are rather, “free” people.

317
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:10,840
So simple things, simple things like a woman

318
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,680
should be always covered properly in her body.

319
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,280
Because she respects her body,

320
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,960
she respects her chastity.

321
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:24,720
But if you tell this to somebody

322
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,960
they won´t listen.

323
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:31,920
As you see the evergreens, they are always clad,

324
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:35,560
no leaf falls off.

325
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,600
I call them as the females,

326
00:29:39,800 --> 00:29:42,960
and the other trees, deciduous,

327
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:49,000
they do lose their leaves so I call them as men.

328
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,040
Because they are men.

329
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,640
Here it´s the other way round, I have seen.

330
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,520
If I used to go to any party

331
00:29:56,720 --> 00:30:00,200
somehow or another they thought I was a very serene person,

332
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:02,040
you meet someone, immediately

333
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:05,120
the man will button up himself

334
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:08,120
and the women will open themselves.

335
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:12,160
I said the whole brain from here has gone to this side

336
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,960
and this one has gone this side.

337
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:17,840
It´s so stupid.

338
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:21,440
But even Mrs. Thatcher they said that she said,

339
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:27,400
that it is our culture that women must expose their bodies.

340
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,840
For what? Are they prostitutes or what?

341
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:38,840
So this craze of exposure of the body

342
00:30:39,040 --> 00:30:43,680
has become so strong now that even in India,

343
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,520
it´s not on the streets or in the household,

344
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,400
but in the cinema, in films, you see women,

345
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,320
really this never happens in India.

346
00:30:52,520 --> 00:30:54,960
What you see in the films, never happens!

347
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,080
If they start wearing dresses like that

348
00:30:57,280 --> 00:31:01,120
so many people will throw stones at them.

349
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,400
Then all other sorts of,

350
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:12,680
I shouldn´t say clumpsy but very grotesque

351
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:18,320
things happened, like, I can´t understand

352
00:31:18,520 --> 00:31:23,680
man having relation with man, woman having relation with woman,

353
00:31:23,880 --> 00:31:27,840
and children, and this and that and that.

354
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:32,960
We didn´t know these things in India, I didn´t know.

355
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:35,960
Why? Why has it happened here?

356
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:39,560
I don´t think 50 years back they used to do that,

357
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,440
also in these countries.

358
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,120
Why have we given up our sense of shame?

359
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,160
And this kind of nonsense that has come into us.

360
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:55,640
I think must be some bhoots in them or badhas in them

361
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:57,320
or something horrible,

362
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:01,320
but this is something absolutely unnatural.

363
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:04,400
Absurd!

364
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:10,920
Then a married man having eyes on unmarried women

365
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:17,600
and unmarried men are having relations.

366
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:21,240
All kinds of things people do.

367
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:25,920
And you won´t believe, this doesn´t happen in India.

368
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:31,320
Really I tell you, these days it sort of spread out,

369
00:32:31,520 --> 00:32:36,800
but I would say in good families you don´t have it.

370
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,480
Somebody told me there is AIDS in India,

371
00:32:39,680 --> 00:32:43,040
yes because they take bath in the river.

372
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:47,840
If they stopped taking bath in the river this will stop.

373
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:50,960
I was a medical student, I have studied,

374
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:53,560
I came from a very open family,

375
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,720
I never knew these things,

376
00:32:55,920 --> 00:33:00,080
that men can do such things, it´s stupid!

377
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,600
Even in the lunatic asylum in India

378
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:07,440
we have never heard of such reports.

379
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:10,920
This is absurd!!

380
00:33:17,760 --> 00:33:20,440
You see the children.

381
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:23,760
The other day Guido gave me a present of a girl,

382
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,520
who was feeling shy,

383
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:29,520
you know, the little girl was holding her frock like this and feeling shy.

384
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:37,560
Shyness is the ornament of women.

385
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,080
Children are all shy.

386
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,560
I remember my granddaughter

387
00:33:43,760 --> 00:33:47,960
she was once watching one magazine,

388
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:51,440
she was very small, two years or so.

389
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:56,120
So she saw one woman in a bikini or something,

390
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:58,440
she was hitting her, “what are you doing?”

391
00:33:58,640 --> 00:33:59,960
She saw in the magazine.

392
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:02,760
My grandmother will come

393
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,280
and give you two slaps, you shut up!

394
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,320
Please wear your dresses”.

395
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,920
They would not. Children don´t like, have you noticed it.

396
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:14,920
I don´t know if they are advanced,

397
00:34:15,120 --> 00:34:20,080
but normally children don´t like it, this shamelessness.

398
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:23,240
But the shamelessness has gone,

399
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,880
to such an extent

400
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:31,760
that to them keeping nude is a very great advancement.

401
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:41,120
This is nothing.

402
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:46,720
Somebody told me that he wanted to save the aboriginals

403
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:49,440
but they were so much,

404
00:34:49,640 --> 00:34:55,400
so much impressed by the white skin,

405
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,800
that they accepted everything.

406
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,120
But they were even having relations

407
00:35:00,320 --> 00:35:04,160
with their own sister, daughter, mother.

408
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,160
Competition.

409
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,880
These are the subjects,

410
00:35:12,080 --> 00:35:14,920
it´s rather heinous to talk about,

411
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:18,680
and I can´t understand

412
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:23,440
how can a human being go to that level.

413
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:30,200
And at this time we have Sahaja Yoga,

414
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,320
where you have become aware, aware

415
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:40,600
of your natural taboos.

416
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:43,800
It is there, because I told you, potentially it is there,

417
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:48,280
it is enlightened and suddenly you have accepted.

418
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:51,600
I never expected so much, I tell you,

419
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:55,360
but you have accepted it,

420
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:59,000
and not only that, but you are enjoying it,

421
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,880
your practicing it.

422
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:07,800
You see the lives of all the great saints.

423
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:14,480
You can´t have something, like Diana,

424
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:16,600
see, they are going to call her a saint.

425
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:19,640
She had no maryadas.

426
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:22,040
Oh I have sympathies with her because

427
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,840
her husband tortured her or maybe something,

428
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,200
but maryadas are very important.

429
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,520
How can she be a saint?

430
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:38,160
Now if you become just an ordinary human being

431
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:43,720
who has his taboos, who understands, who is aware,

432
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:47,920
then they will say, “Oh what a man he was”,

433
00:36:48,120 --> 00:36:51,160
I mean that´s what he was,

434
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:53,320
he was born like that,

435
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:57,840
so such a man is praised, in the West especially.

436
00:36:58,040 --> 00:37:01,200
Also the other way round is that,

437
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:05,200
now the majority is the law.

438
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:08,280
If the majority is stupid,

439
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,880
then all the stupidity is regarded as great.

440
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:19,680
They have no brains they have no intelligence

441
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,360
to understand how can these things help;

442
00:37:23,560 --> 00:37:26,320
alcohol for example.

443
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,040
I mean alcohol, it has done no good to anyone,

444
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:38,880
but alcohol, without alcohol you are no good.

445
00:37:39,080 --> 00:37:40,640
They won´t talk to you they say that

446
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:44,720
unless you have alcohol you cannot talk.

447
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:49,240
And it is so rampant,

448
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,280
it is so much in the society

449
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,880
that all the parties I attended,

450
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:59,880
except for me and my husband, everybody was drinking,

451
00:38:00,080 --> 00:38:05,400
and drinking much more than normal because it was free.

452
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:09,040
They are all poisons,

453
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:11,720
these are all poisons

454
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:18,320
spoiling us completely from one to another.

455
00:38:18,520 --> 00:38:25,640
This one is a taboo now, for cigarettes,

456
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:29,680
imagine – why to smoke?

457
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:34,120
I don´t understand, like a chimney people are smoking.

458
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:38,960
But they have no courage to give it up now.

459
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:42,200
Everywhere, no smoke, no smoke, no smoke.

460
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,720
When will they start “no alcohol?”

461
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:55,920
Everybody sees that it´s so dangerous.

462
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:59,640
It is against human awareness, everybody sees it.

463
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,440
You see people falling down,

464
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:06,120
you see people cursing each other, fighting.

465
00:39:06,320 --> 00:39:09,840
I tell you, if you stop this alcoholism

466
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,160
all this shamelessness will go away.

467
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:18,920
Because when you take alcohol your awareness is abated.

468
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,760
One alcoholic told me

469
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:26,320
“when I take alcohol I don´t see my sister as my sister,

470
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:30,160
but see her as my beloved”.

471
00:39:30,360 --> 00:39:34,200
Well how do you do that? “Yes”.

472
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:40,760
But for all social status and all that you must drink.

473
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:43,920
Now, we don´t even understand how

474
00:39:44,120 --> 00:39:50,680
our primordial taboos are completely battered

475
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:54,520
by the society here.

476
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,120
The simple thing is that

477
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:16,960
to understand your own self,

478
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:21,280
better sometimes to see the stupid people,

479
00:40:21,480 --> 00:40:25,640
you´ll be amazed what sort of things they are doing

480
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:29,040
because I have seen, I used to be very amazed

481
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:31,720
what are they doing?

482
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:36,360
And then to cover it up, to cover it up,

483
00:40:37,640 --> 00:40:43,000
they have etiquettes you know, very elite.

484
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:46,360
They talk in a very special manner,

485
00:40:46,560 --> 00:40:50,680
move themselves in a very,

486
00:40:52,760 --> 00:40:58,040
I should say, like a trained personality

487
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:06,040
and anybody who doesn´t do that is out of their sight.

488
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:11,680
They think that He lacks eliteness.

489
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:19,800
So another idea is that we have to be elite.

490
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:25,760
Ganesha is how made – you see that.

491
00:41:27,760 --> 00:41:33,040
Look at him, He´s by no means elite.

492
00:41:33,720 --> 00:41:38,440
He eats like a glutton

493
00:41:43,360 --> 00:41:48,520
and He looks at you

494
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:55,960
as if He´s going to hit you with his mace.

495
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:07,040
For Ganesha there is no forgiveness,

496
00:42:07,240 --> 00:42:13,600
when he became Christ there He developed,

497
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:17,720
I don´t know how it worked out,

498
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:27,760
but as Ganesha there is not at all forgiveness.

499
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,080
Don´t try to ask forgiveness from Shri Ganesha,

500
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:35,040
He´ll never forgive,

501
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,840
even if his mother says “now you´d better forgive”,

502
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,240
“No, that I´ll not do”.

503
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,560
He never forgives!!

504
00:42:45,760 --> 00:42:49,600
Then only it comes to the point that the Mother has to say

505
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:52,720
“I forgive you”, then He can do it,

506
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:54,640
because one thing about Him is,

507
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:59,040
He´s extremely obedient to his Mother, absolutely,

508
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:01,400
so if the Mother has forgiven, finished.

509
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:06,200
But otherwise, he will never, never forgive,

510
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:13,920
and that´s why all kinds of these horrible diseases are here.

511
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:17,920
Thousands of them.

512
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:24,960
Also if you don´t respect Him then impotency can come

513
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:32,400
or AIDS and all these secret diseases that people have.

514
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:40,640
I had a very bad time with people who suffered

515
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,440
from these secret diseases,

516
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:49,920
because Shri Ganesha accepts my forgiveness

517
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:54,200
but whenever he has a chance, again He comes back!

518
00:43:54,400 --> 00:44:00,640
Now see, they are deities with their own dharma.

519
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:04,560
They too have their own dharma.

520
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:07,960
He gives you a lot of things, he gives you

521
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:12,320
mainly wisdom, discretion, understanding,

522
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:16,960
but if you don´t obey Him, his qualities,

523
00:44:17,160 --> 00:44:21,520
then he´s a very difficult man.

524
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,880
So to tell somebody “Don´t do it” is very difficult,

525
00:44:27,080 --> 00:44:30,600
but the nature takes respite.

526
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:40,640
If you want to become patient it´s not difficult;

527
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,920
but to get you cured on the Mooladhara

528
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:48,320
is very, very difficult.

529
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:53,240
You do get cured no doubt, ultimately,

530
00:44:53,440 --> 00:45:00,360
but the most difficult disease is from Mooladhara.

531
00:45:00,840 --> 00:45:04,720
He´s a child, alright,

532
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,000
He´s an eternal child, He´s innocence,

533
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:17,720
despite all that He cannot forgive you

534
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,040
if you disturb your innocence.

535
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,320
Mother is just the opposite,

536
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:30,400
she wants to save at any cost, she wants to save people.

537
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:34,080
But not Ganesha,

538
00:45:34,280 --> 00:45:38,160
Ganesha says “alright,

539
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,680
you better go to hell”

540
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:47,840
and hell is in our own lives here, you see,

541
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:51,080
those people who like drinking, smoking,

542
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:54,160
prostitution all this – this is all hell.

543
00:45:54,360 --> 00:45:57,440
What else is hell?

544
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:05,080
And he will never save you from hell.

545
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:17,320
Only in your Aarti, in Marathi, of Shri Ganesha,

546
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:20,360
they say that at the time

547
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:24,800
when I am getting my realization

548
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:29,080
you must save me.

549
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,600
That´s the only thing they ask,

550
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:39,000
at the time of my resurrection you must save me.

551
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,320
It does not say that

552
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:45,520
at the time of my resurrection you protect me, no!

553
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,360
You save me.

554
00:46:49,720 --> 00:46:56,080
Because he´s the one who is sitting on every chakra

555
00:46:56,280 --> 00:47:00,880
like a vice-chancellor of the university.

556
00:47:02,360 --> 00:47:05,720
Even if you have Vishnu on your side,

557
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,440
Mahadeva on your side,

558
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,440
but if Shri Ganesha is there sitting

559
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:17,200
and He says “no, not his ascent”,

560
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,720
it doesn´t work out, it´s very difficult.

561
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:28,320
So now I am telling you this that your children are here.

562
00:47:28,520 --> 00:47:30,560
In these modern times

563
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:34,560
horrible things are happening to children.

564
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:40,560
I mean, I think the whole of this negativity is against the innocence.

565
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,160
Wherever they get the children they misuse them,

566
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,320
they teach them bad things.

567
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:51,320
Even the schools everything is so horrid.

568
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:54,680
So then we have to be careful.

569
00:47:54,880 --> 00:47:59,920
We have to be very very careful about our children.

570
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,760
We have to guide them properly, look after them,

571
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:09,360
and let their primordial taboos should be that,

572
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:20,400
that restriction, that taboo, that is to be preserved.

573
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:25,880
So if a child does something nice, appreciate it.

574
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,400
I´m not worried about a child

575
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:31,000
being little bit, what you can call,

576
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:36,880
being a little bit mischievous, here they have to be.

577
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:38,480
It´s alright.

578
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:46,640
But if he takes to anything that is anti Ganesha, be careful!

579
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:52,440
All kinds of diseases can develop,

580
00:48:52,920 --> 00:48:57,800
and if they are destroyed in childhood, these taboos,

581
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:00,960
then they are very difficult to revive.

582
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:05,360
Still I have always said that innocence is never lost,

583
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:08,880
only there are some clouds

584
00:49:09,080 --> 00:49:13,080
which try to cover innocence

585
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:18,600
and we become rather ignorant about it,

586
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,480
that we have done anything wrong.

587
00:49:24,200 --> 00:49:27,440
That is your duty.

588
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,480
Your society is horrible.

589
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,280
Next generation I don´t know where it is going to end up.

590
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:39,240
When I think about it I really get a fright.

591
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:48,160
The solution is that you have to be

592
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:53,720
careful about your children and their thinking

593
00:49:53,920 --> 00:50:01,200
and their attitude towards Shri Ganesha.

594
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:08,160
They are special lovable things for Shri Ganesha.

595
00:50:08,360 --> 00:50:12,640
You can´t imagine how he loves the children

596
00:50:12,840 --> 00:50:17,520
and he´s always there to protect your children,

597
00:50:17,720 --> 00:50:22,320
if he protects anything it is the children he protects,

598
00:50:22,560 --> 00:50:29,160
and if you people really understand what I am saying now,

599
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:36,560
because if you have to cross this margin

600
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,360
of human life and spiritual life,

601
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:46,280
first thing is your Shri Ganesh!

602
00:50:48,840 --> 00:50:53,640
When Kundalini rises Shri Ganesh is quiet,

603
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:58,360
he just supports the Kundalini to rise.

604
00:51:00,120 --> 00:51:04,440
He´s the one who also suggests to you

605
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:08,840
that it´s the wrong way you are doing things.

606
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:17,520
He looks after you, but he´ll not forgive you.

607
00:51:17,720 --> 00:51:22,120
It is not so difficult.

608
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:24,720
The way people talk

609
00:51:24,960 --> 00:51:28,560
about their physical needs and all this nonsense,

610
00:51:28,760 --> 00:51:33,040
even the animals don't talk like that.

611
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:39,280
Try to enjoy things which will give you real enjoyment.

612
00:51:39,480 --> 00:51:45,640
For example flowers, nature, garden.

613
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:49,480
Instead of destroying this nature, try to build it up,

614
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:54,840
try to see how you can make it a beautiful garden,

615
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,880
or a beautiful place.

616
00:52:00,080 --> 00:52:02,600
Every time I am here

617
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,960
I am thinking what should I do with this land here

618
00:52:07,160 --> 00:52:12,160
which is very barren, how can I change it.

619
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:15,520
All the time there is thought

620
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:21,760
about how to make it beautiful,

621
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,720
and in that, if there is innocence,

622
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,760
no greed,

623
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:34,520
there is no competition,

624
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:36,600
there is no attachment,

625
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:39,760
but just to enjoy the beauty

626
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,520
of your own creation, to see how things are.

627
00:52:48,080 --> 00:52:51,120
Out of proportion people have gone,

628
00:52:51,320 --> 00:52:54,360
out of understanding.

629
00:52:54,560 --> 00:52:57,920
For example, here or anywhere else in Europe

630
00:52:58,120 --> 00:53:03,000
you are not supposed to grow anymore fruits.

631
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,480
Why? Because the price must be kept low.

632
00:53:06,680 --> 00:53:08,440
If you have so many fruits

633
00:53:08,640 --> 00:53:14,960
why don´t you send it to places where they don´t have fruits?

634
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:20,880
They will destroy it, finish it, but they will not do that.

635
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:30,920
So the love and feeling for others is not there,

636
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:37,560
and they destroy if something is overproduced by the Mother Earth

637
00:53:37,760 --> 00:53:41,360
just to keep the prices high.

638
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:44,360
Very cruel!

639
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:47,440
They are very cruel still.

640
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:52,760
Only thinking about money, money, money, money.

641
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:55,760
All this happens.

642
00:53:56,640 --> 00:54:01,760
So it´s still happening

643
00:54:01,960 --> 00:54:07,960
and I´m sure one day will come when it will all stop.

644
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:18,480
The pubs are the best buildings in the village.

645
00:54:19,080 --> 00:54:26,240
Then the way they glorify drinking

646
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,440
is the best part of it.

647
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,480
It´s all done, you see it.

648
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:38,760
Now only thing I would like you to have a desire

649
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:44,400
that let drinking be finished, like smoking.

650
00:54:44,840 --> 00:54:50,760
If you think like that might solve a little bit.

651
00:54:50,960 --> 00:54:52,880
I personally think

652
00:54:53,080 --> 00:55:01,000
it is with drinking you develop all these perverted attitudes.

653
00:55:01,360 --> 00:55:06,840
Otherwise if it´s a normal man with a normal brain

654
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:10,240
why should he do such things?

655
00:55:10,440 --> 00:55:15,120
Fighting, quarrelling, killing, violence.

656
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:20,120
It´s impossible to understand

657
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:24,880
how can a normal person do such a thing.

658
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:28,120
Shri Ganesha gives you balance,

659
00:55:28,320 --> 00:55:32,720
he keeps you on the proper track.

660
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:35,600
But if you don´t want to listen to him,

661
00:55:35,800 --> 00:55:38,600
you are thrown away.

662
00:55:45,120 --> 00:55:51,080
I hope you understand our relationship with nature,

663
00:55:51,280 --> 00:55:53,240
with Shri Ganesha

664
00:55:53,440 --> 00:56:00,200
and with our Kundalini is like,

665
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:08,520
absolutely identified with each other, absolutely.

666
00:56:09,800 --> 00:56:12,240
If you start loving the nature

667
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:18,560
all these ideas of spoiling your innocence will be finished.

668
00:56:20,480 --> 00:56:24,240
I used to write poetry, I´m very fond of nature,

669
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:29,320
but then I told myself you have to do work for Sahaja Yoga.

670
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:33,320
If you take to poetry they´ll all call you a poetess

671
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:36,520
and I don´t want to have any such position

672
00:56:36,720 --> 00:56:39,680
to be a poetess and all that, I gave it up.

673
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,240
And I was a very good sportswoman.

674
00:56:42,440 --> 00:56:47,200
I used to play things, I used to be first in every sort of game

675
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:51,360
and I had championship, this and that. I gave it up.

676
00:56:51,560 --> 00:56:54,680
Whatever I did I used to get into it,

677
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,520
I studied medicine

678
00:56:56,720 --> 00:57:01,200
I stood in the first at the whole university. I gave it up.

679
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:09,200
Why? Because I´m the Primordial Mother,

680
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:13,160
and I have to do the job

681
00:57:13,360 --> 00:57:18,120
of awakening the primordial nature,

682
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:20,680
the dharma within human beings,

683
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,240
and that´s what I have to do

684
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:28,160
and nothing else.

685
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:31,200
But for that I don´t do anything I am “Nishkriya”

686
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:34,080
I don´t do anything, really I don´t do.

687
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:36,280
It is done by the nature.

688
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:38,040
Done by Shri Ganesha.

689
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:41,920
Vishnu, Mahesha, everybody, they are doing it.

690
00:57:42,120 --> 00:57:48,920
But, then what is the relationship?

691
00:57:51,000 --> 00:57:56,480
The relationship is, they are all in my body

692
00:57:56,680 --> 00:58:00,680
and they are all bound by their own dharma,

693
00:58:00,880 --> 00:58:02,880
and they act.

694
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,800
This is the relationship,

695
00:58:04,960 --> 00:58:09,760
spontaneous, automatic, like a built-in relationship.

696
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,120
For example, the fan is built in

697
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:16,040
so as soon as you push the button it starts moving.

698
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:18,560
It´s like that.

699
00:58:18,760 --> 00:58:22,120
All of them are related to me,

700
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:26,240
and they have a tremendous protocol,

701
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,680
tremendous respect,

702
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:36,680
that if I say anything they will not finish it.

703
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:39,320
You see this thing is that

704
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:45,840
very very deep thing that I am telling you,

705
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:51,040
that you are a human being,

706
00:58:51,240 --> 00:58:53,640
that there is built in.

707
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:57,920
Within you are your dharmas

708
00:58:58,120 --> 00:59:01,840
and if you go against your dharmas

709
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:05,720
then you´ll be finished.

710
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,360
They´re all built in within you,

711
00:59:09,560 --> 00:59:15,440
they are all there, potentially.

712
00:59:15,640 --> 00:59:21,600
I hope you´ll understand how important it is

713
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:28,440
to be aware of your restrictions within yourself.

714
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:32,080
So thank you very much all of you.

715
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,000
May God bless you!!
