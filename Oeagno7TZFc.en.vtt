00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.320
Shri Krishna resides in our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.520
In the center He resides as Shri Krishna.

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:22.000
On the left-hand side His power, Vishnumaya, His sister, resides.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.720
There He resides as Gopala,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.200
as the one who lived in Gokul played as a child.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.880
On a right-hand side He resides

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:41.040
as the king who ruled in Dwarika, the king Shri Krishna.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.400
These are the three sides of our Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:52.840
The people who use their right side to dominate others,

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.120
use their voice to put down people,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.960
to show their authority,

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:04.920
shout at people,

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.760
are the people who get affected by the right side.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.000
The right side is caught up

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.360
on the physical side you get a very big problem,

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.560
because the Right Heart cannot work out its flow.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:32.080
So you get what you call asthma and all these diseases.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.520
But specially when the Right Heart is affected

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.040
by the fathers problem.

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.240
On the left side is the Vishnumaya,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.240
is the sisterly relationship.

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:53.400
When the sister who is your pure relation

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.720
is not treated as the sister,

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:05.080
when the attitude of a person towards women

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.840
is of indulgence and of lust,

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:14.440
then he develops the Left Vishuddhi.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.200
When he develops a Left Vishuddhi very strongly

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:25.080
and if he has a bad Agya of he has eyes which are roving eyes,

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.720
then this Left Vishuddhi causes lot of trouble.

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.280
Left Vishuddhi can be also caused by, as you know,

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.200
by feeling guilty about things for nothing at all.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:40.680
All these problems arise from Vishuddhi.

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.840
But Vishuddhi Chakra has a specialty.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:50.160
When the humane beings raised their head upward

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.440
from Mother Earth towards the sky,

00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:58.720
sky is, ether is Shri Krishna's nature,

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:02.800
when it raises head towards the ether, towards the sky,

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.000
then this Vishuddhi Chakra developed into a different dimension

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:13.520
and people started developing ego and superego.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.720
Superego was already developed,

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.640
but ego developed in such a way,

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.400
that it started suppressing the superego.

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.000
That's how you have got conditionings on one side

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.040
of the Vishuddhi and ego on the other side.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:33.320
When I told you the other day that you give up your free will

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.960
in the sense that when you raised your head

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:40.960
you did it through your free will with your power of growing,

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:44.320
that you had as animals.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:47.640
After that now you have reached to the humane level.

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:51.120
And to rise above the humane level now

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:55.400
you have to do is to seek your complete freedom.

00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.480
And for that Vishuddhi Chakra is going to help you a lot.

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.920
On this Vishuddhi Chakra we have to really pay full attention.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.600
It is such a complicated Chakra.

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.800
It has all the vowels of a Devanagari's script

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:19.080
emitting out of the sound

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.240
of the shakti that is passing through it,

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:25.000
of the Kundalini that is passing through it.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:30.600
So all the vowels are heard on these Chakras.

00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:36.440
These vowels are, as you know, sixteen in number.

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.920
Without the vowel

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.320
in the Devanagari you cannot write anything.

00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:49.400
Vowels are the sustenance,

00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:53.120
are the power that

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:57.760
supports every consonant.

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.240
So it's very important that our vowels

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:07.360
have to be fully nourished and respected.

00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:10.200
The movement of the neck,

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:15.640
as you have seen in all international life,

00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:18.680
if you see, everybody has practically the same.

00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.040
Even those who cannot hear,

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.080
those who do not understand your language,

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:26.080
you can nod like this,

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.280
can say, "No", like this.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.200
Everyone understand this is "Yes" or "No".

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.160
In some particular area

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.600
of course they have little different type of nodding.

00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.000
But too much of nodding of head is not a very good sign.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.120
I have seen people in the West,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.680
if you tell them something

00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.080
to show that they appreciated it,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:52.440
they'll go on for quite some time.

00:08:54.840 --> 00:08:57.200
That's not necessary.

00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:02.560
Just have to say, "Alright", or "I've understood it", that's all.

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.200
You have to use your voice

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.680
instead of nodding like this all the time.

00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:11.320
Is very bad, very-very bad for the Vishuddhi Chakra.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:14.320
Or some of them are the other way round.

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:17.240
That whatever it is they'll put up their head like this

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:19.480
and they won't talk properly,

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.960
they will not say a word, they'll just keep quiet.

00:09:22.200 --> 00:09:26.080
You may go on pinching them, doing anything, they won't badge.

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.920
This kind of personality is also very much detrimental

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.920
to the growth of their evolution.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.720
Apart from that, their Vishuddhi becomes a very big problem.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:41.520
Because of Vishuddhi there are so many problems.

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:44.640
Like angina you develop because of Vishuddhi.

00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.080
You develop spondylosis because of Vishuddhi.

00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:51.200
Sometimes people lose their voices completely.

00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.040
Sometimes they have all the time coughing.

00:09:54.280 --> 00:09:56.240
And there are so many physical problems

00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.480
out of Vishuddhi because, as I said,

00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:02.160
this a very-very complicated center,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:07.600
which looks after your ear, nose, throat, all the sixteenth

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:12.480
sub plexuses are there, which are looked after by this center.

00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:16.640
But above all is the center of discrimination.

00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:21.840
The center of discrimination only comes when you are free people.

00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:25.960
Till you are biased, till you have your own concept,

00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:28.160
you cannot be discrete.

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:31.680
And that's the one point where one must understand

00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:34.880
that to achieve your complete freedom,

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:38.760
you have to get your Vishuddhi Chakra cleared out.

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:45.160
First and foremost thing is that we must speak in a sweet manner,

00:10:45.520 --> 00:10:48.280
speak to someone in a sweet manner,

00:10:48.640 --> 00:10:52.920
not artificially, but sweetly.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:58.240
Speak in a manner that another person likes it.

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.720
Saptyam vadeyt, priyam vadeyt.

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:04.000
Speak the truth, don't tell the lies.

00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.920
If you go on telling lies after some time,

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:08.880
even if you tell the truth, it will become a lie.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:10.840
But if you are telling the truth,

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:14.880
that even if you tell a lie, it becomes a truth.

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.800
Now some people

00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:27.520
think that they can be cunning,

00:11:27.760 --> 00:11:31.280
by their talks they can cheat people.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.040
But actually they are cheating themselves.

00:11:34.560 --> 00:11:36.840
All such people who cheat others

00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:40.640
by sweet talks, by artificial talks

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.720
or by some maneuvering

00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:46.680
go to such a horrible state

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.640
and in this Kali Yuga specially they are cursed

00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:53.560
and they get exposed and people know about them,

00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:57.280
that these are the greatest liars ever known.

00:11:57.840 --> 00:11:59.400
Now the times are coming

00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:02.560
when all such people will be exposed

00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.040
very much more than they have been ever exposed.

00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:11.640
So be careful not to think that you can cheat.

00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.280
In Sahaja Yoga specially you cannot cheat.

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:17.000
Those who try to cheat sometimes think that,

00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:20.720
"We can befool Mother, we can some or other carry on.

00:12:21.040 --> 00:12:26.120
If we see in front of Mother She won't know, what we are up to".

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.400
Is not so.

00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.080
I may not say, I may use My discretion not to say,

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:37.880
I may allow you to have a long way, but be careful.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.320
Do not come into My illusions,

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:43.120
I'm very illusive.

00:12:43.360 --> 00:12:47.560
And when I play My illusions you will suddenly find yourself

00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:50.560
in a very difficult situation and then you will say,

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:53.400
"Mother, why am I in this situation?"

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:56.480
So this is one of the qualities of Shri Krishna

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:59.760
that He is the one who becomes illusive.

00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:03.120
And His illusiveness not cunning but illusive.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:07.640
In His illusiveness He exposes people to themselves.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.200
There are so many stories of Shri Krishna

00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:14.760
in which He had illusively acted to give

00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.720
greater joy to some people,

00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:19.120
to give nice lessons to some people

00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.160
and sometimes to punish.

00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.400
For us it is important, that we are Sahaja Yogis,

00:13:28.760 --> 00:13:31.000
in this lifetime we have a chance

00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:34.160
our Kundalini has risen,

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:37.160
that we can face ourselves,

00:13:37.560 --> 00:13:40.240
that we can correct our chakras,

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.920
that we know about ourselves,

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.000
that we know where is the problem is.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.480
I've known of people who were caught up with left Vishuddhis

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:54.080
and have become devilish by nature, devilish.

00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.080
They have gone out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.200
they have criticized Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:57.400 --> 00:13:59.400
they have tried to trouble Me a lot.

00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:02.680
So don't think that if Vishuddhi is spoiled

00:14:02.880 --> 00:14:04.800
there's nothing so special about it.

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:07.800
It can be a very dangerous center.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:12.080
Of course, Heart, Agya and Vishuddhi, these three centers

00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:14.200
one has to guard against

00:14:14.440 --> 00:14:18.480
because three of them can allow you

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:24.720
or can force you to become one with identification

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:31.120
of evil as your own.

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:37.120
You might just feel that it's nice to be evil;

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:43.240
you might just feel that it is a great fun to be evil

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.680
and you might become evil.

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.880
So at the Vishuddhi Chakra one has to be extremely careful.

00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:54.200
Vishuddhi Chakra you looks after so many things,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:57.600
specially your skin, your eyes.

00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:01.560
Skin is now I've seen people who have bad Vishuddhi

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.600
can have all kinds of funny troubles with their skins.

00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:06.960
Of course, it has to do with your liver,

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:11.320
but skin is the way it shines,

00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:14.160
the way it glows,

00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:17.240
depends on how you smile,

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:20.400
how you look at the world.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:26.000
Many people have a habit of smiling for nothing at all.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:28.080
Specially women I have seen, ladies I have seen,

00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:30.640
they just smile stupidly.

00:15:31.040 --> 00:15:33.840
That's not [inaudible], one should not be stupid.

00:15:34.240 --> 00:15:38.840
Stupidity is against Shri Krishna's principle.

00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:44.240
Like you have seen the stupid people, how they are.

00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:47.840
Their tongue is always halfway out.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.080
If you have noticed the stupid man,

00:15:50.360 --> 00:15:55.000
his face is that, his tongue is always out,

00:15:55.320 --> 00:16:01.000
mouth half open and he looks like a dumbfound fool.

00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:05.120
Now in this only the Vishuddhi plays the part.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:09.160
Another one is the one where

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:12.440
you get the Vishddhi's straits.

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:16.200
So such a person has very purse lips,

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:21.920
angry lips and he doesn't talk.

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.080
The another one might even get the expression of an idiot,

00:16:28.560 --> 00:16:33.880
but could be just making a face like that.

00:16:34.440 --> 00:16:39.840
Because if he's cunning he may take a

00:16:42.720 --> 00:16:46.200
I would say a kind of a

00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.080
rupa or... (yogi: "Mask").

00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:52.200
Mask you can say, a mask on his face,

00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:57.800
that he is an idiot and make high to deceive you.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:03.040
So nothing is definite about Vishuddhi.

00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.240
Whatever may be the expression of a person,

00:17:05.440 --> 00:17:07.560
a person may look very innocent.

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.440
Because that's the thing you can do with your Vishuddhi.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:12.920
You are free because you've raised your head

00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.160
and this point you have achieved, this kind of a special aptitude

00:17:17.400 --> 00:17:21.960
that you can deceive yourself and you can deceive others.

00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:25.360
Some people look extremely innocent on the face.

00:17:25.680 --> 00:17:29.080
They may look to be very simple people,

00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.040
but may turn out to be horrid.

00:17:32.400 --> 00:17:35.160
Some people may look to be idiotic,

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.080
but may be very intelligent.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.360
So it is how you play with your Vishuddhi

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:44.240
which is, which is responsible.

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.200
But the main thing what I'm trying to tell you,

00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.680
that you can maneuver your Vishuddhi.

00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:52.920
The way you want to put your expression,

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.800
the way want you make your face,

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.960
the way you want to suggest something,

00:17:57.280 --> 00:17:59.120
all you can maneuver

00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.400
and you can keep your heart away from it.

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.000
In the heart you may have poison for a person,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.560
but outwardly you may say

00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:09.560
to that person in a very sweet manner something

00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:11.480
that a person might feel impressed.

00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:16.600
But in this all this behavior, pattern of behavior,

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:20.880
you are deceiving yourself, not deceiving the another person.

00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:23.280
Because yourself is Spirit,

00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:25.800
which knows you very well.

00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:29.200
And this will go on and on

00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:32.760
for all your lives that have to come.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:38.840
So there is no need in any way to be artificial in your expression,

00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:42.720
there is no need to hide anything in your expression.

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:45.000
Of course, I mean, if you don't like someone

00:18:45.200 --> 00:18:46.920
you need not just say, "I don't like you",

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:50.080
but in that case you have to be

00:18:50.400 --> 00:18:53.320
not also so much appreciative of the person,

00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.280
that he's deluded into your appreciation.

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.280
Now, eyes are very important

00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:05.240
and eyes in a way are very much looked after by Vishuddhi

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.280
because the muscles of the eyes

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:14.240
are looked after by Vishuddhi.

00:19:15.160 --> 00:19:17.400
And the kind of the muscles we have

00:19:17.680 --> 00:19:19.160
which pull our eyes,

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:23.880
which close our eyelids and all that is very much suggestive.

00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.840
You must noticed that there are some people who come to Me,

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.720
their eyes go on like this.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:33.120
When they close their eyes, they cannot keep it shut.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.680
There are some people, when they open their eyes to Me

00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:39.440
they just keep the eyes open, they just cannot close it.

00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:42.240
Both are in trouble.

00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.880
The ones which are the ones,

00:19:46.080 --> 00:19:50.320
which are just keeping the eyes open all the time,

00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:53.440
are the people having supraconscious.

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:59.080
And those who flicking their eyes are having the subconscious.

00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:01.240
Some people have also

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:06.640
habit of eh keeping the eyes in an angle all the time

00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:08.000
they never see you straight,

00:20:08.200 --> 00:20:10.320
but in angle they'll see.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.840
Ah, they think it's sometimes it's very fashionable sometimes,

00:20:16.080 --> 00:20:19.400
ladies think it's a very good way of looking at people

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.680
and some of them have such eyes

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:24.120
that they'll go on and looking and boring

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.200
their greedy eyes onto others,

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:29.480
or their lusty eyes onto others.

00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:32.440
This is the worst thing you can do to your eyes,

00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:38.400
because such people are easily can become blind.

00:20:39.400 --> 00:20:42.280
Such people might have trouble of the eyes.

00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:44.120
Specially reddening of the eyes

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.040
can come to such people

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:48.360
very much, very quickly.

00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:52.920
So one has to be careful to keep the eyes very pure.

00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.800
The eyes of an Yogeshwara, who was Shri Krishna.

00:20:57.080 --> 00:20:58.680
He was a witness,

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.520
He, He was on this Earth,

00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:07.000
He play, He played with Radha. He married five women,

00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:08.880
they were the five elements.

00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:10.960
Sixteen thousand women He married,

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.000
they were His sixteen thousand powers,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:16.480
but He was Yogeshwara.

00:21:17.240 --> 00:21:18.240
He was Yogeshwara;

00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.920
He had no lust in His eyes, in His mind about them, at all.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:26.000
He was beyond them, He was Yogeshwara.

00:21:26.320 --> 00:21:28.120
That was the testing point of His,

00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:32.760
that He had no lust in His eyes about these women that He had.

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:34.800
Such an Yogeshwara is there!

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:37.640
Of course, I don't expect you to be Shri Krishna.

00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.960
But you have your wife.

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.800
Those who do not have wife must look forward to a wife.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:48.000
That we'll get wives and will be,

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:51.080
ah, we'll have a wife and think of a wife,

00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.400
who will be your own

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.520
so that your eyes will not fall onto every woman

00:21:55.720 --> 00:21:58.680
who comes across ah with that kind of a thing.

00:21:58.920 --> 00:22:02.000
I've seen people, even the photographs or anything they see,

00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.600
it's surprising, I mean, there's nothing in the photograph,

00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.720
what is in a photograph?

00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:08.360
But even a photograph can attract their attention,

00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.240
I mean, I don't know what can attract their attention like this.

00:22:11.440 --> 00:22:15.600
But they are so vulnerable and they have no control over their eyes.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:20.240
No control, they become absolutely lost and they have no control.

00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.880
That shows that they have no powers in them

00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.960
and they are slaves of their responses.

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:29.880
For the eyes are very-very important as Christ has said,

00:22:30.080 --> 00:22:32.880
"Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes".

00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.440
There should be no adultery.

00:22:35.840 --> 00:22:40.160
Some people have a habit of showing anger with the eyes, you see.

00:22:40.400 --> 00:22:41.840
If they have to show anger with their eyes

00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.480
they'll just go on looking like this and show the anger.

00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.000
I need there not do that to you, but.

00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:55.920
And the angry eyes you see are another dangerous things

00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:57.360
to do with your eyes,

00:22:57.600 --> 00:22:59.680
because then they can become mesmeric.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:02.400
If you start putting your eyes onto something

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:05.800
and concentrating on it your eyes might become mesmeric

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.160
means bhoots will start coming out of your eyes.

00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.440
First of all you'll catch bhoots in your eyes,

00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.440
they'll settle down there and then

00:23:12.640 --> 00:23:16.040
they will be falling on other people as bhoots.

00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:19.120
It's a very-very dangerous thing

00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:24.480
to go on looking at something continuously with concentration.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.120
There's another kind of a stupid thing or a bhootish thing maybe,

00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.760
that people ask you to meditate here. It's absolutely wrong.

00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.160
In Gita it is written, still it is wrong.

00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:40.120
Nobody should put attention here.

00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:44.000
Instead of put attention, put attention at the door.

00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:46.840
What's the use of looking at a window?

00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:49.480
You can't get out of it, can you?

00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:53.720
If you have to look at anything be on a lookout for the door.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:55.640
And the door is here.

00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:58.200
The door of Sahasrara is to be open out.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:03.000
So you should not try to concentrate on this path.

00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:07.120
Many people who have concentrated on this path have become mad.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.880
When they become mad, people say,

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:12.240
"These are Yogi but has got [SOUNDS LIKE - unmanitasha]."

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.040
That he moves like a madcap.

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.480
How can a Yogi be a madcap?

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.480
That means he's united with God. Is He mad?

00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:25.880
All such mad people are really mad,

00:24:26.080 --> 00:24:28.240
they've nothing to do with God, definitely.

00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:31.560
But there are people who believe in such things,

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.640
"Oh, he is in love with God,"

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.280
so he just jumps on the stage and goes into ecstasy,

00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.880
dances like a madcap.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.320
How can God be mad?

00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.040
First position is this that the sanest personality is God,

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:47.680
has to be.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.480
From where do the sanity comes?

00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.840
So this is one thing one has to understand,

00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:56.720
that any such practices

00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:00.840
can lead you to lunacy and one should not doing.

00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:04.160
Thirdly in the indiscretion that one has

00:25:04.440 --> 00:25:09.000
comes from people who are good hearted, nice people,

00:25:09.240 --> 00:25:14.600
but they get kind away by the smiles of others

00:25:14.800 --> 00:25:18.840
or by the artificial goodness they show on their faces.

00:25:19.160 --> 00:25:22.760
I've known some people, they always have a face like

00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:25.120
as if they are all the time smiling.

00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.680
No, I can't do that way.

00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:31.520
All the time if you look at someone like this, you see.

00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:34.440
It means as if you are mocking at the person.

00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:37.040
And there are people I've seen who just like this

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.680
all the time have them [lips] like this.

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.400
So, one should not be always in one pose.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:49.920
Sometimes this muscles can get very weak

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:52.320
and start paining if you take one.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:53.400
There are some others

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:56.440
who always try to show they are very miserable.

00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.400
I don't know what do they want to attract.

00:26:03.840 --> 00:26:05.520
Attract the attention of others,

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:08.160
attract ah the bhoots in themselves

00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.160
or I don't know what are they up to,

00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:12.800
why can't they keep a normal face.

00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:15.760
Even while sitting in dhaan, or meditation,

00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:19.240
I've seen that trying to show Me or may whatever it is,

00:26:19.480 --> 00:26:22.560
because My eyes are mostly closed, but doesn't matter.

00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:26.240
When I open My eyes I find some people like this, like that.

00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.680
Why? What is the need? You have to have a balanced face.

00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.800
That's what Shri Krishna had described the Sthita Pragya,

00:26:35.040 --> 00:26:37.920
One who is balanced,

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:42.120
who doesn't laugh like an idiot,

00:26:42.520 --> 00:26:45.720
who laughs, but not like an idiot.

00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.760
Nor he's a serious like another kind of an idiot.

00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.840
So both the things are not at all

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:57.360
expression of your inner being.

00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:01.920
Such a person is, as I told you today,

00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:05.960
is not frivolous, but not serious either,

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.920
but full of joy within himself.

00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:11.720
He doesn't want you to be unhappy,

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:15.880
never would like that you should be unhappy people.

00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:19.760
But human beings if they want to be unhappy,

00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:21.040
what can anybody help,

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:23.360
because they have got the free will to be unhappy.

00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.440
They have got a free will to cut their nose,

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.600
they've a free will to cut their ears,

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:30.280
they've a free will to commit suicide.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:34.080
They have this free will so-called.

00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:38.680
Now the greatest freewill comes from Vishuddhi Chakra,

00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.600
as I told you and that's why we call Him Yogeshwara,

00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:46.320
He is the Ishwara of Yoga.

00:27:46.560 --> 00:27:49.240
The establishment of Yoga is possible

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:52.920
when you surrender yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:57.120
Completely surrenders yourself to Shri Krishna.

00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:59.920
Your Yoga will be established. Means what?

00:28:00.160 --> 00:28:03.680
Means all your balances will be established.

00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:08.400
You go into complete balance

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.920
and that balance is complete because Vishnu,

00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:18.400
Who is the Incarnation for sustaining the dharma,

00:28:18.760 --> 00:28:22.560
Who is responsible for giving you the balance,

00:28:22.840 --> 00:28:27.280
becomes complete in the form of Shri Krishna.

00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:32.120
That's why He said that, "You leave all the dharmas

00:28:32.800 --> 00:28:35.600
[SOUNDS LIKE - sarva dharma nam partitte jam ma meik shana wraja]",

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.000
that's why surrender all of them to Me.

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.480
So all the dharmas if you put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna,

00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:45.400
means if you follow His ideals,

00:28:45.720 --> 00:28:50.040
then all your dharmas are balanced.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:55.400
But after Realization you go beyond dharma.

00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.920
Whenever you go wrong in dharma,

00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:01.480
[SOUNDS LIKE - dharmatchutta] as they call it,

00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.000
when you go wrong in dharma,

00:29:04.240 --> 00:29:07.120
that's the time you have to surrender yourself to Shri Krishna,

00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:08.880
so that He establishes your dharma.

00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:11.000
There are so many dharmas.

00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.240
There is the pati dharm -

00:29:15.480 --> 00:29:19.280
husbands dharma, patni dharma - wive's dharma,

00:29:19.480 --> 00:29:23.120
father's dharma, mother's dharma, son's dharmas,

00:29:23.400 --> 00:29:25.800
the [SOUNDS LIKE - rashtra] dharma - means the nations dharma.

00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.560
Then you have all kinds of dharmas also

00:29:28.800 --> 00:29:33.480
of we can say ah where one has to bow

00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:38.720
to the higher things of life.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:42.480
But then He says, "[SOUNDS LIKE - Sarva dharma anam pari tedg]"

00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:45.360
"Forget all the dharmas."

00:29:45.960 --> 00:29:47.920
"[SOUNDS LIKE-Maa meikam charanam gachchhami ]", -

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.800
"Just surrender your dharmas, all of them to Me",

00:29:52.040 --> 00:29:54.040
that is at Vishuddhi.

00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:59.920
At Vishuddhi Chakra you surrender all your other dharmas.

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:05.440
It means that it all gets sublimated,

00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:11.280
it all gets complete, the wholesomeness is achieved

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:15.920
because He is collective being,

00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:18.160
He is the Virat,

00:30:18.440 --> 00:30:24.680
because He is the integrated form of all the dharmas

00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:28.720
and He is the Virata in our brain.

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:31.480
He represents our brain.

00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:36.280
And when this Virat in us is awakened fully,

00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:40.400
then all the dharmas become natural with us.

00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:43.120
We don't have to do any dharmas,

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:45.720
we don't have to be conscious of any dharmas,

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:50.880
but automatically we become dharma ourselves.

00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:53.840
For example, there are people now, say, Christ;

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:56.240
we can take example of Christ.

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:58.240
He was dharma personified.

00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:02.400
He would not steal money from anybody, will He?

00:31:03.080 --> 00:31:06.200
Will He run away with somebody's wife, will He?

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:10.080
When He do anything wrong? No, He cannot.

00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:13.880
Why? Because He was Dharma.

00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:17.000
So now you have become dharmateet,

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.040
means you have entered into the kingdom of God,

00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:22.600
into the Virata's conditions

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.840
and there your condition is such that your state is such,

00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:31.560
your state is such, that you are dharma.

00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:35.880
If you try to do adharma, you'll suffer.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:39.480
If you try to do wrong, you'll suffer.

00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.480
Here I don't have to tell you to be righteous;

00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:43.760
I don't have to tell you, there's no need.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.800
I don't have to tell you that you tell the truth.

00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.920
I don't have to tell you, "Don't steal".

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:50.240
I don't have to do all these things.

00:31:50.480 --> 00:31:51.680
Only thing I can tell you

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.640
that get rid of your ego and superego, that's all.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.800
In a very general terminology.

00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:03.080
But you will follow Christ automatically,

00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:07.640
you will follow Krishna automatically, Sahaj,

00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:12.000
because now you have gone beyond dharma,

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.560
you have crossed the limits of dharma

00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:16.720
where you had to follow a dharma,

00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.080
now you have become the dharma.

00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:23.520
Where you will stand, wherever you will be

00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:25.800
dharma will stand with you.

00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:29.600
People will look at you and say, "Here is a dharma standing,

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.000
he's the dharma to be worshipped".

00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:37.120
Not because of anything but because your state

00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:41.520
is that of dharma, you have gone beyond that.

00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:46.440
Supposing this is loudspeaker I'm using today to talk to you.

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:50.440
But supposing this loudspeaker becomes part and parcel of Me,

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.640
I don't have to use this, I go beyond it.

00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:56.080
In the same way

00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:59.400
you are using the dharma first of all to establish yourself.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.400
But when you go beyond dharma

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:05.360
into the state of Virata,

00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:08.760
then you don't need any dharma,

00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.160
you become the dharma of Virat.

00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:13.080
Now, what is the dharma of Virat,

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:15.200
what is the dharma of Shri Krishna

00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:17.880
is collectivity.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.520
Krishna

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:27.560
is the Brain.

00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:29.880
Shiva is the Heart

00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:32.760
and Brahmadeva is the Liver.

00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:36.920
Now what's the faculty of this brain is?

00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:43.400
That the tree of life of evolution grows downward as He says.

00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:48.760
And this tree is growing downwards

00:33:49.040 --> 00:33:51.320
of awareness from the brain.

00:33:51.560 --> 00:33:54.080
But if you have to go to the roots

00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:57.680
you have to ascend and that ascent you have achieved,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.560
now you have gone to the roots of your brain

00:34:00.880 --> 00:34:02.320
where all your roots are enlightened,

00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.160
all your nerves are enlightened,

00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.560
your brain is enlightened,

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:08.520
you are an enlightened person.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.840
When you are in darkness

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:13.800
you may catch hold of a snake as rope,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:16.600
but when you are in light you will drop it.

00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:19.840
In the same way, when you become enlightened,

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.720
your dharma is enlightened.

00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:25.080
You don't have to take to any guru

00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.880
or to any book or to anyone,

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:31.360
you know yourself in your own life that this is wrong.

00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:35.120
Now the collectivity part of it is very important.

00:34:35.440 --> 00:34:40.920
Anybody who cannot be collective is not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

00:34:41.320 --> 00:34:43.240
Not yet a Sahaja Yogi at all.

00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.080
Collective in the sense

00:34:45.400 --> 00:34:49.120
that anybody who cannot live with other Sahaja Yogis,

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.720
who tries to find faults with someone all the time,

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.640
wants to run away with his wife

00:34:54.840 --> 00:34:57.640
and'll stay somewhere else or with her husband,

00:34:57.920 --> 00:35:01.880
who wants to get out, is not a person who's collective.

00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:03.560
There's no need to say

00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:05.960
that, "I cannot live under the circumstances

00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.520
in which Sahaja Yogis can live".

00:35:07.720 --> 00:35:10.960
If you are a Sahaja Yogi, if are a Yogi, you can live.

00:35:11.320 --> 00:35:14.880
Look at Me, I'm such an old woman, I can live anywhere.

00:35:15.200 --> 00:35:16.360
You take Me to a village,

00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:19.200
you take Me to any place I'm not bothered

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:23.040
about any physical comforts at all.

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:26.080
Because I'm comfortable within Myself.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.440
My comforts are within.

00:35:28.800 --> 00:35:31.920
In the same way, a person who is not collective,

00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.440
like many people just come to Pujas, that's all.

00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:38.080
It's like going to the church only once in Christmas

00:35:38.440 --> 00:35:40.800
and then say, "Christ doesn't look after us".

00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:43.560
Of course, not going to church and you don't meet Christ,

00:35:43.760 --> 00:35:47.080
but I mean to say that just to have a casual way

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:49.560
of Sahaja Yoga you cannot gain.

00:35:49.840 --> 00:35:51.800
You have to be collective.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.040
And collective means

00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.120
that at every collective program you should be there.

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:57.880
You should always meet collectively,

00:35:58.080 --> 00:36:00.640
meditate collectively, live collectively,

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:04.080
and try to find ways and methods of being collective.

00:36:04.480 --> 00:36:06.360
There are so many evil forces,

00:36:06.560 --> 00:36:10.120
which are all the time trying to attack collectivity.

00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:11.760
First they will attack the leaders.

00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:13.400
That's the first thing.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.680
Any leader tell somebody, "You shouldn't do like this",

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:19.880
immediately that person will start spreading stories against,

00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.480
"That leader is very bad, he's like this, he's very harsh.

00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.680
He didn't garland me, he didn't give me this, that".

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.360
How can you garland a bhoot, can you?

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:36.040
That if that in that ah doesn't work out

00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:37.680
then they have their sly methods

00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:40.640
of going round and talking something here and there

00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:43.960
in the ears to create some sort of a politics.

00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:48.840
All such people will be thrown out of Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:53.000
As there is a centrifugal and a centripetal force,

00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.480
both acting equal and opposite.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.520
Anybody who goes against collectivity,

00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:01.960
who sticks to their bhoots, sticks to their negativity

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.960
will have to get out of Sahaja Yoga

00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:07.600
and that's is to be remembered,

00:37:07.840 --> 00:37:11.560
that to be collective is to be joyous,

00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:15.200
is to be progressive, to be going further.

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:19.960
It was alright when people were meditating in the Himalayas.

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:22.720
It was alright at that time they were all alone,

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.160
meditating all alone,

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.080
to achieve something for the collective.

00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:33.240
But they also did not get their Realization.

00:37:33.720 --> 00:37:36.680
When you have got your Realization remember this.

00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:40.520
Now you have entered into the Kingdom of God,

00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:42.520
into the Kingdom of Virat

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:48.760
where you are a part and parcel of a collective being.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:54.640
You are not alone, you cannot be single out,

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:56.680
you cannot separate yourself.

00:37:56.960 --> 00:38:00.640
Now you are awakened in the body of Virata

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:02.840
and you cannot get out of it.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:05.920
If you try to get out of it, you cannot be nourished.

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:08.280
Supposing, I take out part of My body.

00:38:08.520 --> 00:38:11.360
Will it be nourished by this body? It won't.

00:38:11.600 --> 00:38:13.280
In the same way you have now become

00:38:13.480 --> 00:38:15.760
part and parcel of that collectivity

00:38:16.000 --> 00:38:20.080
and that collectivity that Virat is going to look after you,

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:21.520
going to nourish you,

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:24.760
going to do the everything that is necessary

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.560
for your spiritual, physical, mental, emotional,

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:31.000
even financial development.

00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:34.960
But if you cut it short, if you

00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:38.000
try to block the collectivity,

00:38:38.200 --> 00:38:42.080
if you try to make problems for collectivity

00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:45.760
or even if you try just to get out of the collectivity,

00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.880
then that is not our interest, that is not our work.

00:38:52.160 --> 00:38:56.280
This is to be understood fully,

00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:58.680
in every way possible

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.800
and this when is understood in a proper way,

00:39:03.040 --> 00:39:04.640
you should know that

00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:08.400
collectivity is not only your advancement,

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:11.880
is not only your development,

00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:15.640
is not only your achievements,

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:19.600
is the achievement of the whole humanity.

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:24.960
The purpose of your creation

00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:28.560
is fulfilled by that.

00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:32.360
Those people who live in the ashram

00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:37.160
are better of always, than the people who live alone, always.

00:39:37.880 --> 00:39:41.520
They will always have better results,

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:44.680
than the people who live alone.

00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:46.160
Maybe they live alone

00:39:46.360 --> 00:39:50.040
because they want to have a little private life or a privacy.

00:39:50.320 --> 00:39:54.280
But their privacy is not going to help them.

00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:57.400
That's not going to help them at all.

00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.280
The more we live together,

00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:01.080
the more you reside together,

00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:03.520
the more you enjoy together,

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:08.040
there will be greater chances of your advancement.

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:11.040
The more you will try to make yourself private,

00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:12.920
the more you'll try to get out of it,

00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:15.400
whatever explanation you may give,

00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:17.960
God understands, very well.

00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:21.520
So all such things where you cut off yourself

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.200
from the mainstream,

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:26.120
you try to get out of the main stream,

00:40:26.480 --> 00:40:29.880
then there is a big problem for you.

00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:33.200
Of course, for certain conveniences you may,

00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.680
for your certain understanding you may,

00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:41.520
but you should enjoy more the company of Sahaja Yogis,

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.920
than your own private company

00:40:44.160 --> 00:40:46.320
in the dingy room of yours.

00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:49.520
That is one thing you can judge yourself.

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.600
Do you all enjoy the company of Sahaja Yogis

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:55.120
or you enjoy the company

00:40:55.320 --> 00:41:00.360
of three-four of your family people together in a circus.

00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:03.920
Judgment is your own.

00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.200
Yogi "A difficulty Shri Mataji".

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:11.360
Nothing is difficult in Sahaja Yoga.

00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:14.920
It is the simplest thing to be a Sahaja Yogi.

00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.320
And even more simple to be collective.

00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:21.400
To be uncollective you have to do something.

00:41:21.760 --> 00:41:24.960
Like I said that it is very easy not to drink.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.680
Mean, I mean, drink some wines and things.

00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:31.440
Because if you don't want to drink you are sitting at home,

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:32.960
it's alright, don't have to do anything.

00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.480
But supposing you have to drink,

00:41:34.680 --> 00:41:37.160
then you have to go a pub or you have to go somebody,

00:41:37.400 --> 00:41:39.880
open the bottle, get a particular type of a glass,

00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.160
pour it down, this, that.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:44.360
In India, for example, where there is prohibition,

00:41:44.560 --> 00:41:46.160
you are sitting with a fright.

00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:53.360
But for a person who just drinks water he doesn't have to do it.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:58.080
So to do wrong one has to do something.

00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:01.400
But to be good you don't have to do much.

00:42:01.840 --> 00:42:06.080
Is absolutely labor saving, energy saving process

00:42:10.840 --> 00:42:13.600
You see, to do bad, supposing, you see,

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:17.440
I ah want to harm somebody,

00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:20.280
I'll have to go out of the way to find out ways, methods.

00:42:20.520 --> 00:42:24.240
If I to tell lies I have to think of ten lies to cover that one lie.

00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.680
But if I tell the truth, finished,

00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:31.000
I am still I've told the truth, finished, with few words it's done.

00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.760
So to be collective is much more easier.

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.400
Of course, not for crooked people,

00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:38.560
because crooked people whenever they move

00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:41.080
their angularities trouble others.

00:42:41.280 --> 00:42:46.080
You see, like ah ah poking ah of thorns.

00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:50.040
But those who are flowers they fitting anywhere,

00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:52.040
people like them.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:54.320
They like their fragrance,

00:42:54.600 --> 00:42:58.320
they look at them, they enjoy them beautiful things.

00:42:58.520 --> 00:43:01.840
Now see, today they are looking like lotuses.

00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:05.960
How is it? Without doing anything they have become lotuses.

00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:08.840
How? How they have become like lotuses?

00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:15.200
Whether they are lotuses or they are daisies God only knows.

00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:19.280
But they have become lotuses Sahaj.

00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:23.000
How? Because they are one with God.

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.640
When we stand in our own way,

00:43:25.840 --> 00:43:28.640
when we try to do something privately,

00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:31.480
then God said, "Alright, go private'.

00:43:35.640 --> 00:43:40.400
But when we are public He looks after us.

00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:45.440
And then in Sahaj Yoga, as you know,

00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:47.320
that collective growth

00:43:48.280 --> 00:43:55.240
is the only way we understand Sahaj Yoga.

00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:58.480
Somebody knows something, somebody knows something else,

00:43:58.680 --> 00:44:00.680
somebody knows something else.

00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.080
When we are collective,

00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.400
then we really understand every aspect of Sahaj Yoga.

00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:09.000
Supposing, there is somebody a scientist,

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:10.760
somebody is a musician,

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:13.320
somebody is another thing.

00:44:13.560 --> 00:44:15.240
We cannot know everything.

00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:17.000
So you know something from this one,

00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.280
something from that one,

00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:19.720
something from that.

00:44:19.960 --> 00:44:23.080
So all the rivers has it's flowing into that collectivity

00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:26.200
and you enjoy the ocean of these ah rivers.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:29.440
You don't have to go to all the rivers in India,

00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:33.560
like you go from Ganga, Yamuna, Saraswati, Kaweri

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:34.920
you thousands of lives.

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.320
Go to the sea, all of them are there.

00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:47.280
Like that you have to enjoy the sea where everything meets.

00:44:47.640 --> 00:44:52.480
All kinds of beautiful things are there and you enjoy that.

00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:57.000
I hope this Puja which is a very remarkable Puja.

00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:00.320
Firstly so many things are Sahaj.

00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.560
Firstly they told Me

00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:07.480
the telephone number of this place is 32 16 32.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:14.760
He, He's accompanied by 64 Yoginis, Shri Krishna.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:17.600
So 32 on this side and 32 on that side and He sitting here

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:23.720
This place is called as Black ah Lake.

00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:25.960
Krishna is black.

00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.320
This place they got suddenly

00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:30.640
and this is the only place in this

00:45:30.880 --> 00:45:35.200
so-called military regime of Switzerland

00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:39.760
where people can sleep on the ground.

00:45:40.200 --> 00:45:41.960
You are not supposed to sleep on the ground.

00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.600
If there's no cot you hang in the

00:45:43.840 --> 00:45:45.880
air, but you cannot touch the ground.

00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:52.000
That kind of the stupid military business is here.

00:45:52.480 --> 00:45:56.240
Where to find such a sensible, practical,

00:45:56.800 --> 00:46:00.280
such a cheap place for you is godsent.

00:46:00.640 --> 00:46:05.040
We are here surrounded by beautiful things with the cows,

00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:10.240
so many cows at the time when it is Krishna's birthday.

00:46:10.680 --> 00:46:12.320
So many cows, so fond of cows

00:46:12.560 --> 00:46:15.720
and the cows when they their bells

00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:19.000
move in the morning I heard, in the evening so beautiful

00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.840
and when they are moving home in the evening

00:46:22.040 --> 00:46:24.440
how the as they call [SOUNDS LIKE -guraj] -

00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:27.640
is the dust of their feet was filling the sky

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:30.360
is just Gokul here I felt.

00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:34.200
Today also there's one thing more one has to say,

00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:40.080
that is the sixteenth Shri Krishna Puja.

00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:45.680
So in so many ways this is a very great Puja

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.560
which you are attending for which

00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:54.360
people have to take thousands and thousands of janmas (births)

00:46:54.680 --> 00:46:59.040
do so many punyas, which you have got so Sahaj,

00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:01.920
because there must be something about you people also.

00:47:02.120 --> 00:47:05.400
May God bless you.

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.120
Now, what are we decided?

00:48:37.560 --> 00:48:42.400
Now they have got ah mantras

00:48:43.080 --> 00:48:46.880
written in Sanskrit that

00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:55.120
and 108 Names of Shri Krishna [NOT AUDIBLE] they got.

00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.680
The one, one Rustam has done them in Sanskrit

00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.600
and Gregoire has done them in.

00:49:01.800 --> 00:49:04.880
I think everybody's hearing Me, aren't you?

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.480
And Gregoire has because you have to hear Me from Sahastrara,

00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:10.880
you can.

00:49:11.200 --> 00:49:14.840
And Gregoire has done in English language.

00:49:15.240 --> 00:49:20.000
So we'll have

00:49:20.840 --> 00:49:25.800
two types of Sanskrit and English words,

00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:31.400
describing Shri Krishna's nature.

00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:29.000
"Now today let the all the Sagittarius to [INAUDIBLE- My Puja?].

00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:33.080
It's Krisna's rashi Sagittarius, [SOUNDS LIKE - nurtaras].

00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.720
Sagittarius, how many you are? Come along.

00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:37.000
"Dhanur dhara - that is one of the Names of Shri Krishna ...

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:41.640
[A FEW INDIAN WORDS] or Madhusudana."
