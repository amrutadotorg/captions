00:26.458 --> 00:33.999
At the very outset I would like to apologize for being so late today

00:34.166 --> 00:38.917
but I realized that

00:39.166 --> 00:42.083
that when something is very important

00:42.291 --> 00:44.750
from God’s point of view,

00:44.959 --> 00:48.959
all the negative forces work out their plans,

00:49.125 --> 00:53.333
how to delay, how to put obstructions,

00:53.542 --> 00:56.917
how to bring hindrances, how to deviate.

00:57.083 --> 00:59.500
It’s very surprising.

00:59.709 --> 01:05.125
And today, I think would be best if I tell you

01:12.959 --> 01:17.417
about God’s will and how we human beings

01:17.625 --> 01:21.208
try to go against it all the time.

01:22.875 --> 01:26.250
God’s will is extremely simple.

01:28.250 --> 01:31.250
He is

01:32.667 --> 01:35.667
Divine Love.

01:38.291 --> 01:41.542
He is Compassion.

01:42.208 --> 01:45.542
He is Ocean of Mercy.

01:46.208 --> 01:52.208
And in His mercy and in compassion He created this world,

01:52.792 --> 01:55.750
and then created human beings,

01:55.959 --> 01:58.959
just to give them

01:59.709 --> 02:04.083
the highest thing in life: joy.

02:04.333 --> 02:07.834
Joy, which is single thing;

02:08.000 --> 02:11.500
it does not have duality,

02:11.709 --> 02:15.583
like sorrow, unhappiness,

02:16.458 --> 02:19.625
like day and night.

02:23.125 --> 02:28.208
But how we are anti-joy

02:28.417 --> 02:34.417
and anti-God,

02:35.291 --> 02:39.667
and why it happens, we’ll have to see that.

02:41.291 --> 02:44.500
Our awareness, as you know, grows

02:44.709 --> 02:47.000
through our brain,

02:47.208 --> 02:50.208
downward;

02:50.458 --> 02:54.999
and whatever starts growing downward,

02:55.166 --> 03:01.125
makes us away from God,

03:01.417 --> 03:03.500
in a way.

03:03.709 --> 03:06.500
Ultimately we have to achieve God,

03:06.709 --> 03:11.166
but first we go little bit away from that awareness

03:11.375 --> 03:14.542
of being one with God,

03:16.750 --> 03:20.041
just to understand that freedom

03:20.250 --> 03:23.208
has to be used properly.

03:23.417 --> 03:28.542
Without that training, without that education,

03:28.834 --> 03:31.542
no use giving freedom to human beings.

03:31.750 --> 03:36.959
You have seen the “free” countries, what have they achieved?

03:37.125 --> 03:39.709
In their freedom, what have we achieved?

03:39.917 --> 03:44.083
Atom bombs to kill ourselves! I mean it is stupid,

03:44.291 --> 03:47.625
it’s foolish, it's absurd!

03:48.917 --> 03:50.917
But we have done it, and we are proud of it,

03:51.083 --> 03:52.875
and still we are busy how to make it

03:53.041 --> 03:55.166
even worse and worse and worse, but what's that?

03:55.375 --> 03:58.291
This is how we move.

03:59.792 --> 04:04.333
The awareness that was our own human awareness

04:04.542 --> 04:09.000
was given to us for freedom,

04:09.208 --> 04:13.166
to be tested, to be experimented, to be seen —

04:13.625 --> 04:16.875
and then to have ultimate freedom

04:17.041 --> 04:19.500
by which you become the Spirit.

04:19.709 --> 04:23.709
You have to become the Spirit ultimately.

04:25.291 --> 04:29.250
But as we start growing in our awareness, so-called,

04:29.458 --> 04:34.333
our concern is not for the Spirit.

04:34.542 --> 04:36.999
I would say, like a tree,

04:37.166 --> 04:41.875
which embeds itself into its roots.

04:42.041 --> 04:45.709
And the roots that we have are in the brain.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.375
And then we start growing,

04:48.583 --> 04:52.792
upward, upward, and upward,

04:53.291 --> 04:56.500
till the leaves are created, fruits are created,

04:56.709 --> 04:59.709
flowers are created.

05:01.709 --> 05:06.250
On the contrary, before reaching the fruit stage,

05:07.999 --> 05:13.999
what happens to us - that we start creating artificial leaves

05:14.333 --> 05:17.208
and enjoying them.

05:17.417 --> 05:19.458
We take to artificiality.

05:19.667 --> 05:23.625
Once this identification of artificiality starts,

05:23.834 --> 05:27.875
we start going away from reality

05:28.041 --> 05:31.917
to negative thoughts, or to over-positive thoughts

05:32.083 --> 05:35.792
by which we make atom bombs and all that —

05:35.999 --> 05:41.291
so-called positive thoughts, which are actually anti-God.

05:42.083 --> 05:46.834
So there are two branches really

05:47.291 --> 05:49.834
in life that we branch off.

05:50.000 --> 05:55.875
Some people like to go towards the left side of negative attitude,

05:56.041 --> 06:02.041
by which they injure themselves, trouble themselves,

06:02.999 --> 06:06.542
do all kinds of things by which they can die,

06:06.750 --> 06:09.041
in the most miserable manner;

06:09.250 --> 06:12.959
get all kinds of diseases upon themselves,

06:13.125 --> 06:17.625
torture their body, torture everything that they have.

06:18.000 --> 06:22.000
And the another side is on the right-hand side, where they move

06:22.208 --> 06:27.166
to torture others, to destroy others, to overpower others.

06:27.375 --> 06:33.375
Both ways we are away from God, and His mercy, and His grace.

06:34.917 --> 06:39.625
The concern should be throughout towards the Spirit,

06:39.834 --> 06:46.333
then the movement is in the right direction.

06:47.291 --> 06:52.208
But this concern breaks up very easily in human beings

06:52.417 --> 06:54.458
because they are free to do it.

06:54.667 --> 06:59.999
In their ego they just break it; the connection, they break it.

07:01.083 --> 07:08.375
So much so that when you develop artificial ways of enjoying life,

07:10.250 --> 07:14.625
then even the consciousness of God is lost —

07:15.083 --> 07:19.291
that He exists, that He has created us,

07:19.500 --> 07:22.500
that He is the One

07:24.500 --> 07:27.208
who is running the show.

07:27.417 --> 07:30.709
We become so conscious of ourselves

07:30.917 --> 07:35.083
that we think there’s nothing wrong.

07:35.291 --> 07:40.625
We do this, we do that, plunge into all kinds of problems;

07:40.834 --> 07:44.542
and we don’t understand that what we are doing

07:44.750 --> 07:47.959
is against ourselves, and “ourselves” means against God,

07:48.125 --> 07:50.625
because God has created us, He loves us.

07:50.834 --> 07:53.834
We don’t love ourselves.

07:54.917 --> 07:59.750
If we had loved ourselves, we would not have ruined our own body,

07:59.959 --> 08:02.834
our own systems, everything that we have,

08:03.000 --> 08:06.625
by saying, “What’s wrong? Why not do it?”

08:06.834 --> 08:10.041
You must love this body of yours,

08:10.250 --> 08:13.333
this mind of yours,

08:14.417 --> 08:16.458
your society.

08:16.959 --> 08:21.750
Everything you have to love because God has created you in His love.

08:21.959 --> 08:26.583
But the love itself has become such a perverted word now.

08:27.375 --> 08:31.250
“What is wrong in promiscuousness? It is love.”

08:31.792 --> 08:37.667
If I tell that “No, it is not, because it is against nature.

08:37.875 --> 08:42.999
It gives you trouble; you will be in a mess.

08:43.166 --> 08:45.542
Listen to Me, it’s not proper,”

08:45.750 --> 08:50.458
then people think that “This Lady is very matronly,

08:50.667 --> 08:54.875
She is very old-fashioned, Victorian.”

08:55.041 --> 09:00.999
But it’s a fact. Why do things which will destroy you?

09:01.166 --> 09:03.375
You can’t create yourself; you can’t even create

09:03.583 --> 09:06.542
a nose for yourself, leave alone the whole body.

09:06.750 --> 09:12.583
Then why should we be anti ourselves, first of all?

09:12.792 --> 09:17.083
Then why should we be anti the society that we have created,

09:17.291 --> 09:19.959
then against the whole nation that we have created,

09:20.125 --> 09:22.999
and nations, and nations, and nations?

09:23.166 --> 09:26.166
What are they doing, these all these politicians today?

09:26.375 --> 09:29.583
Fighting for what? I just look at them, I can’t understand

09:29.792 --> 09:31.792
what’s the matter with these people?

09:31.999 --> 09:35.417
Fighting to create more destructive forces,

09:35.625 --> 09:40.542
more horrible things to destroy innocent human beings?

09:40.917 --> 09:44.625
Those who are innocent are simply worried.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.667
They don’t know what to do.

09:47.875 --> 09:53.709
They don’t understand why they are to be dead tomorrow

09:53.917 --> 09:56.792
because some people have gone off their heads.

09:56.999 --> 09:59.417
And those who have gone off their heads are sitting

09:59.625 --> 10:01.792
at the helm of affairs,

10:02.041 --> 10:04.125
and we select them and elect them,

10:04.333 --> 10:08.041
all such people who are sitting at the helm of affairs.

10:10.583 --> 10:13.333
That’s how the negativity grows within us;

10:13.542 --> 10:15.583
we become negative.

10:15.792 --> 10:20.125
Both things are negative attitude because they negate God.

10:20.333 --> 10:24.125
Negation of God is the first crime we have created.

10:24.333 --> 10:28.999
We are not afraid of that God, awe for Him.

10:29.417 --> 10:32.709
He is Compassion. He is Mercy. He is everything.

10:32.917 --> 10:36.875
But in His mercy only He’s going to destroy the world.

10:37.250 --> 10:42.542
He won’t allow you to commit more sins against Him.

10:43.208 --> 10:48.999
He destroys - even - otherwise from within.

10:49.458 --> 10:51.625
What is cancer?

10:51.834 --> 10:55.250
What are all these diseases that are coming in our body?

10:55.458 --> 10:58.000
They are nothing but our own destruction forces

10:58.208 --> 11:01.166
that we ourselves have built within ourselves,

11:01.375 --> 11:04.250
are breaking through.

11:04.458 --> 11:08.625
There is no fear from outside invasion,

11:08.834 --> 11:12.500
or from any star, or from any

11:12.834 --> 11:17.625
extraterrestrial attack.

11:17.834 --> 11:22.500
No, there is not. It is within us.

11:22.709 --> 11:27.375
The attack is built within us, of which we should be aware.

11:27.583 --> 11:32.041
In the name of freedom we have collected within ourselves

11:32.250 --> 11:36.041
all the germs of our destruction.

11:36.875 --> 11:41.125
It is such a built-in

11:42.709 --> 11:46.458
process within us that we are not even aware

11:46.667 --> 11:51.458
that they are growing, that they are there.

11:51.667 --> 11:56.875
We are quite satisfied with ourselves, with our artificial life,

11:57.041 --> 12:00.709
with our so-called

12:00.917 --> 12:04.458
etiquettes and superficial mannerism.

12:04.667 --> 12:07.917
Innately within us

12:08.375 --> 12:11.458
there resides the Spirit

12:11.667 --> 12:15.583
which wants to enlighten you,

12:15.792 --> 12:17.792
which is anxious to enlighten you,

12:17.999 --> 12:22.041
to give you the peace, the bliss, the joy of your being.

12:22.250 --> 12:27.000
This beautiful lamp of yours which is being created,

12:27.583 --> 12:30.792
is with a great purpose.

12:30.999 --> 12:34.250
It has to be enlightened. Respect yourself!

12:34.458 --> 12:38.208
There is no “respect” word left in the dictionary today.

12:38.750 --> 12:42.083
Respect yourself!

12:42.375 --> 12:46.583
We have to respect this lamp,

12:46.792 --> 12:51.583
which has the light of the Spirit, that it should be enlightened;

12:51.792 --> 12:56.125
and let us be that lamp, that shows the path

12:56.333 --> 12:59.625
of glorification of your being.

12:59.834 --> 13:04.834
And in that light we can see God’s Glory too.

13:05.000 --> 13:09.542
It’s such a beautiful world He has created for us.

13:10.500 --> 13:13.917
Everything He has given us,

13:14.375 --> 13:18.875
but we in our ignorance and in so-called freedom

13:19.041 --> 13:23.583
have ruined so many things.

13:24.250 --> 13:27.417
It is sometimes shocking to see how people are going

13:27.625 --> 13:30.999
just towards hell directly.

13:31.166 --> 13:34.792
For a Mother it is a thing of great concern:

13:34.999 --> 13:40.375
How to stop this pull? How to get them out of it?

13:40.959 --> 13:46.792
how to make them understand what is your worth, what is your value?

13:47.458 --> 13:50.917
You don’t take human life for granted.

13:51.083 --> 13:53.333
It is a very precious life

13:53.542 --> 13:58.667
created out of many processes.

13:58.875 --> 14:02.125
With great difficulty it was created.

14:02.333 --> 14:06.333
Don’t forget that you have to become the Spirit.

14:06.583 --> 14:09.500
Without that, your life is just a waste,

14:09.709 --> 14:11.709
the whole creation is a waste.

14:11.959 --> 14:15.041
Because you are the highest in the creation!

14:15.250 --> 14:20.834
You are the epitome of the creation, and what are you up to?

14:21.333 --> 14:23.709
We have to form nucleuses

14:23.917 --> 14:29.333
who will talk about Spirit now openly, about God.

14:29.542 --> 14:32.875
I was amazed to hear that in this country

14:33.041 --> 14:35.166
people don’t like to talk about God.

14:35.417 --> 14:37.417
You cannot talk about God.

14:37.667 --> 14:39.917
As soon as you say “God” — “Oh nothing! God?

14:40.083 --> 14:43.125
That’s religion. That’s nothing to do with me.”

14:43.333 --> 14:45.875
Can you imagine such a state of affair

14:46.041 --> 14:48.250
where you cannot talk about your Creator?

14:48.458 --> 14:54.333
Either you form some sort of a closed, secretive organization

14:54.542 --> 14:56.875
where everybody can not enter into,

14:57.041 --> 15:01.041
and say, “Now, we belong to certain cult of God.”

15:01.250 --> 15:04.250
How can God have cults?

15:06.166 --> 15:10.583
Just think of it. How can He have separate churches,

15:10.834 --> 15:14.834
and separate temples and mosques? How can He have?

15:15.125 --> 15:19.375
How can we become fanatic in the name of God? Can you imagine?

15:19.583 --> 15:23.500
This is what we have done to God! We have become fanatic.

15:24.125 --> 15:26.166
There’s a stone;

15:26.375 --> 15:29.417
that stone, when it touches anything, it becomes gold.

15:29.625 --> 15:32.333
But there must be a stone, when it touches human beings,

15:32.542 --> 15:36.625
they become like prisons.

15:37.125 --> 15:40.333
That’s why there is so much fanaticism.

15:40.542 --> 15:43.458
It’s a problem today.

15:43.667 --> 15:46.333
How to break this news and message

15:46.542 --> 15:51.999
that you are the Spirit and you have to become the Spirit?

15:52.166 --> 15:54.750
There is a Marathi poet called Namdev.

15:54.959 --> 15:58.125
Because my mother tongue is Marathi,

15:58.333 --> 16:02.875
and thank God I have been born in Maharashtra -

16:03.041 --> 16:05.417
because it’s a country of saints,

16:05.625 --> 16:08.166
thousands of saints lived in that country.

16:08.375 --> 16:10.917
It’s the tradition, is so spiritual!

16:11.083 --> 16:13.208
Spirituality is the tradition of that place

16:13.417 --> 16:15.750
where I was born in that Maharashtra, called -

16:15.959 --> 16:19.166
“maha” means the great and “rashtra” means the nation.

16:19.375 --> 16:22.417
I don’t know why they thought of it, but I feel that way

16:22.625 --> 16:26.500
that the tradition is of spirituality,

16:27.375 --> 16:31.083
not of alcoholism, or drugism,

16:31.291 --> 16:34.875
or call any other “isms” as they are.

16:35.083 --> 16:38.667
But of spirituality is the tradition in that country

16:38.875 --> 16:43.667
where a very simple poet called Namdev - he was a tailor,

16:43.875 --> 16:46.291
himself was just a tailor, ordinary,

16:46.500 --> 16:49.999
and he said, has written a very sweet poem,

16:50.166 --> 16:54.000
which I will just tell you the explain what he says.

16:54.208 --> 16:57.250
He says that a little boy

16:57.458 --> 17:02.959
is flying a kite in the sky.

17:03.125 --> 17:06.500
He’s looking at the sky, he’s talking to his friends,

17:06.709 --> 17:08.834
he’s moving upward and downward,

17:09.000 --> 17:11.542
and he’s discussing things here and there -

17:11.750 --> 17:15.917
but his attention is on the kite.

17:16.834 --> 17:21.083
Then he says a lady who is carrying her little baby

17:21.291 --> 17:26.041
is doing the work in the house; she’s giving water to her husband;

17:26.250 --> 17:30.542
and she is also sitting down and cooking,

17:30.750 --> 17:33.083
and then she’s getting up to wash something;

17:33.291 --> 17:39.291
the child is on her waist, resting -

17:39.834 --> 17:44.542
but her attention is all the time on the child.

17:44.750 --> 17:50.333
There’s a lady who is walking with a pitcher of water on her head.

17:50.542 --> 17:53.000
She’s walking with many other ladies;

17:53.208 --> 17:56.959
they are all walking together laughing, smiling,

17:57.125 --> 18:00.208
young ladies talking to each other

18:01.041 --> 18:03.709
and discussing things -

18:03.917 --> 18:07.625
but their attention is on their Spirit,

18:07.834 --> 18:12.250
in the sense it is on that pitcher of water.

18:12.458 --> 18:17.041
In the same way, we, though we have to lead a life here,

18:17.250 --> 18:19.667
of other things,

18:19.875 --> 18:24.208
it is absurd that we do not have our attention on our Spirit,

18:24.417 --> 18:29.166
which is the giver of joy - the ultimate in life.

18:31.333 --> 18:34.999
But as soon as you start talking about something like that,

18:35.166 --> 18:38.250
people think that it is something trash,

18:38.458 --> 18:40.583
not to be listened to. Most surprising!

18:40.792 --> 18:44.125
They want to hear the same mundane things again and again.

18:44.333 --> 18:47.834
You see, if it is a broadcast by, say, Conservative Party,

18:48.000 --> 18:50.417
or Labor Party, or another party, or any other party,

18:50.625 --> 18:53.583
they’ll listen to it for hours together.

18:53.792 --> 18:57.250
It’s such a mundane stuff, every year you hear that.

18:57.458 --> 19:02.041
But if somebody says that “No, this is all artificial.

19:03.583 --> 19:08.542
You have something much more within you, rise to that point,”

19:08.750 --> 19:11.333
they think it is something… “We have not come to hear

19:11.542 --> 19:14.999
all these things, what is this Mother telling us?”

19:15.959 --> 19:19.125
But now awaken and arise!

19:19.333 --> 19:23.166
On a different level we have to come to, to understand

19:23.375 --> 19:27.375
that what these people have done so far - and we have accepted it,

19:27.583 --> 19:30.291
we have taken it for granted all these years -

19:30.500 --> 19:33.999
has done no good to us.

19:34.291 --> 19:38.333
We have to rise above this to see: there is, beyond the horizon,

19:38.542 --> 19:43.041
a star shining within us, and that is our Spirit.

19:43.250 --> 19:46.250
People have talked about it, made another cult.

19:46.458 --> 19:49.041
Talk about God, made another cult.

19:49.250 --> 19:52.000
This time I saw one thing in the BBC,

19:52.208 --> 19:55.834
they showed a cult which says, “We are doing God’s work.”

19:56.000 --> 19:58.166
Doing God’s work? And the ladies

19:58.375 --> 20:01.125
are tying up their thighs with thorns and things,

20:01.333 --> 20:04.917
and hurting themselves, cutting their flesh.

20:05.083 --> 20:07.667
And the explanation is - just imagine, in the name of God

20:07.875 --> 20:09.500
doing such horrible stuff -

20:09.709 --> 20:13.959
and the explanation is that “You must

20:14.750 --> 20:17.750
have mortification.”

20:18.083 --> 20:21.417
Why? Why should you have?

20:21.625 --> 20:25.125
“Because Christ did it.” Are you Christ?

20:25.333 --> 20:28.291
And that means Christ, whatever He did is waste.

20:28.500 --> 20:32.667
Little bit of yours was needed to add.

20:32.875 --> 20:35.709
Whatever He is done is more than sufficient

20:35.917 --> 20:40.500
because He was the Prince.

20:40.709 --> 20:44.917
And if a prince has to go through the mortification,

20:45.083 --> 20:48.083
it’s a very great thing.

20:49.291 --> 20:54.250
Not for a beggar to go through the mortification, what is so great?

20:54.458 --> 20:57.417
He’s already done it.

20:57.625 --> 21:00.709
He has worked for us.

21:00.917 --> 21:05.125
He’s just to be enlightened within us,

21:06.500 --> 21:11.208
and that’s how we have to get to our realization.

21:12.250 --> 21:17.792
Now to sit down and to question

21:17.999 --> 21:20.999
is very easy.

21:21.792 --> 21:27.000
That’s the easiest thing to do, is to sit down and ask questions.

21:27.999 --> 21:31.417
But best is to get to it,

21:31.625 --> 21:33.875
to get your realization.

21:34.041 --> 21:37.000
That is the most important thing today.

21:37.208 --> 21:40.709
Of course, under the circumstances,

21:40.917 --> 21:45.417
as the human beings are, it is not going to work very fast.

21:45.625 --> 21:50.291
I’m sure of it. I have tried My level best.

21:50.500 --> 21:52.917
Like mountains you have to raise the Kundalini,

21:53.083 --> 21:57.917
really like mountains; you feel so tired and fagged out.

21:58.083 --> 22:01.542
But then they don’t want to appreciate it,

22:01.750 --> 22:04.875
so, not to feel disappointed,

22:05.041 --> 22:08.542
not to feel hurt about it.

22:08.750 --> 22:13.750
Slowly and steadily, I am sure,

22:13.959 --> 22:17.083
in your own eyes people will see the light.

22:17.291 --> 22:20.458
People will see how your life is transformed

22:20.667 --> 22:23.750
into joy and bliss and understanding.

22:23.959 --> 22:29.500
They will see how loving and dignified you have become,

22:29.750 --> 22:32.917
and then they are going to believe

22:33.083 --> 22:36.875
that there is a better life for you.

22:37.667 --> 22:40.333
The state is so bad for some people;

22:40.542 --> 22:45.458
they see, as I told you, a black picture of the whole thing.

22:45.667 --> 22:50.458
They are so disappointed that they have given up.

22:50.667 --> 22:54.000
They have just given up, they said, “Now we’ve finished with this.

22:54.208 --> 22:57.125
We’ve done everything now. We don’t want to do any more.”

22:57.333 --> 23:01.083
I’ve seen in France many people are sitting outside and discussing

23:01.291 --> 23:04.959
that “When are we going to have now the ten stars

23:05.125 --> 23:08.375
meeting together to collapse this world, once for all.”

23:08.583 --> 23:10.583
They are discussing

23:10.792 --> 23:13.959
that “Let us be finished soon now. We have had enough of it.

23:14.125 --> 23:16.917
Let’s have the ultimate destruction, whether it was atom bomb

23:17.083 --> 23:20.208
or anything, let us be finished, had enough of it.”

23:20.417 --> 23:22.583
It is so desperate.

23:22.792 --> 23:27.250
I can understand their desperation, those who are thinking about it,

23:27.458 --> 23:31.208
those who are concerned about it and bothered about it,

23:31.417 --> 23:33.999
no doubt one would feel desperate.

23:34.166 --> 23:37.500
Even the Sahaja Yogis sometimes get very upset

23:37.709 --> 23:41.500
and get extremely desperate and they say, “Give up, Mother.

23:41.709 --> 23:45.291
Just we’ve finished with it. Now no more!”

23:46.333 --> 23:50.291
But I don’t know how to remove My attention

23:50.500 --> 23:53.208
from the Spirit.

23:53.417 --> 23:56.291
If you can try, you try your level best to remove it,

23:56.500 --> 23:58.458
you cannot. Now you are there.

23:58.667 --> 24:02.417
So, whatever it is, till the last breath of your life

24:02.625 --> 24:07.250
you will fight to save as many as possible.

24:07.458 --> 24:11.999
So, all those sahaja yogis who got very frustrated

24:12.166 --> 24:17.208
in certain endeavors, I have to say — you should not be frustrated.

24:17.417 --> 24:19.792
You have to keep your courage

24:19.999 --> 24:24.917
and understanding that if you have feeling for others,

24:25.125 --> 24:29.083
and if you really show your concern to them,

24:29.333 --> 24:32.291
they will understand you and will be able

24:32.625 --> 24:36.542
to get more and more people saved, emancipated,

24:37.125 --> 24:41.917
and they will enter into the Kingdom of God.

24:42.083 --> 24:46.333
As you are enjoying, they will also enjoy.

24:46.542 --> 24:49.458
Only snag in the enjoyment is that you feel

24:49.667 --> 24:53.625
that so many are still lost. Doesn’t matter.

24:53.834 --> 24:57.709
That has to be made up. We have to work hard.

24:57.917 --> 25:01.083
We have to understand that there are negative forces

25:01.375 --> 25:03.041
which are pulling them down.

25:03.250 --> 25:07.041
They are ignorant; they do not know beyond this life

25:07.250 --> 25:13.250
resides the eternal life of beauty and glory.

25:13.709 --> 25:16.625
But gradually, I am sure, it will work out.

25:16.834 --> 25:19.583
Specially for this meeting,

25:19.792 --> 25:22.375
they had lots of ups and downs,

25:22.583 --> 25:27.166
and whole thing was very discouraging.

25:27.375 --> 25:31.625
But still — one must understand

25:31.834 --> 25:34.625
that God’s work is blessed by God.

25:34.834 --> 25:38.625
He will render all His help,

25:38.917 --> 25:43.625
all His blessings on you,

25:43.834 --> 25:49.750
to enrich you, to enable you to perform your divine duties.

25:51.500 --> 25:57.500
The time

25:57.709 --> 26:00.125
is passing.

26:00.333 --> 26:03.333
Very little time left;

26:03.542 --> 26:05.583
it’s running out,

26:05.792 --> 26:10.500
and that’s why the desperation is more in people.

26:12.000 --> 26:16.500
This desperation itself has brought forth

26:17.083 --> 26:21.291
the advent of Sahaja Yoga on this earth,

26:22.375 --> 26:28.125
and you should feel more

26:29.458 --> 26:33.000
stronger to fight

26:34.208 --> 26:37.999
these obstructions that you feel around,

26:38.166 --> 26:41.166
and should work out

26:42.667 --> 26:46.583
the ultimate goal of this creation.

26:46.792 --> 26:49.792
May God bless you!

26:52.208 --> 26:55.875
I would request

26:56.917 --> 27:02.250
people to be seated now

27:02.458 --> 27:05.208
for a while

27:05.417 --> 27:11.417
because we should try to get our Realization now.

27:13.583 --> 27:19.041
One should have little time for oneself.

27:21.834 --> 27:27.000
There is no limit of time in Sahaja Yoga.

27:27.208 --> 27:30.999
Whenever the Kundalini has to rise, She rises.

27:31.166 --> 27:35.166
May be today, may be tomorrow, may be day after.

27:35.375 --> 27:39.375
Whenever you have to get your realization, it works out.

27:39.583 --> 27:43.083
Only thing is we can expedite it,

27:43.291 --> 27:49.000
we can work harder to cleanse the path to achieve it.

27:49.208 --> 27:54.250
But we must make a start now, and once it works out,

27:54.458 --> 27:58.625
then it is easy to handle it and to go further.

27:58.834 --> 28:04.083
I’m sure John must have told you about the Kundalini.

28:04.291 --> 28:07.583
Moreover, you can take the books from here.

28:07.792 --> 28:10.208
There are little books published for the first people

28:10.417 --> 28:12.750
who are coming to Sahaja Yoga.

28:12.959 --> 28:16.875
It looks very complicated - it is not.

28:17.083 --> 28:20.583
Like the switch here,

28:20.792 --> 28:26.792
which can put all the lights to their enlightenment,

28:27.500 --> 28:29.500
in the same way there’s a switch within you

28:29.709 --> 28:31.875
which is called as the Kundalini.

28:32.041 --> 28:35.417
And all this machinery is not to be bothered about.

28:35.625 --> 28:38.959
Once you get your realization, the whole thing becomes very easy,

28:39.125 --> 28:41.125
and you can get to it.

28:41.333 --> 28:43.625
Of course, you know you can’t pay for it.

28:43.834 --> 28:47.625
It’s very low-level business to pay for it.

28:47.834 --> 28:51.792
People don’t understand that how can you pay for God’s love!

28:51.999 --> 28:54.000
They can’t understand, this is beyond their mind,

28:54.208 --> 28:56.999
because whatever they have got today - even the air -

28:57.166 --> 28:59.917
they have to pay for it.

29:00.083 --> 29:03.709
And you cannot put in any effort,

29:03.917 --> 29:11.333
or you cannot put in any pain

29:11.542 --> 29:16.458
or any troublesome things for yourself.

29:16.667 --> 29:20.041
Moreover, there is complete freedom for you.

29:20.250 --> 29:23.166
We cannot bind you by writing down

29:23.375 --> 29:25.875
a sort of your name in the ledger,

29:26.041 --> 29:29.750
and then making you a member and giving you a member card.

29:29.959 --> 29:32.333
There is nothing like that in Sahaja Yoga is possible.

29:32.542 --> 29:35.583
You can see it very clear, it is not possible -

29:35.792 --> 29:40.375
if you understand on what level I’m talking.

29:40.625 --> 29:45.083
You are absolutely free to get your realization,

29:45.291 --> 29:49.375
absolutely free to move further with it;

29:49.583 --> 29:52.875
and even, at that moment, if you want to leave,

29:53.041 --> 29:55.959
you are absolutely free to leave.

29:56.125 --> 30:02.083
There’s nobody who is going to ask you to come back.

30:02.291 --> 30:07.000
It is your own desire, it is your own wish

30:07.208 --> 30:09.959
and it is your free will

30:10.125 --> 30:13.417
that is going to be respected.

30:13.625 --> 30:18.333
So nobody should think that we have a membership like a cult has,

30:18.542 --> 30:22.208
or there is any fear that “If we get out of Sahaja Yoga,

30:22.417 --> 30:26.834
then these people will catch hold of our necks and bring it back.”

30:28.041 --> 30:31.000
So, it is not so.

30:31.208 --> 30:36.959
It is a welcoming place and also it has an exit door.

30:37.125 --> 30:40.291
Some people just get through one door and get out,

30:40.500 --> 30:44.625
like a shuttle. No problem. It’s all right for us.

30:44.834 --> 30:48.750
On the contrary, one feels relieved with such people

30:48.959 --> 30:53.375
because if they cannot stick on, they cannot get to Sahaja Yoga.

30:53.583 --> 30:55.959
Like any tree,

30:56.125 --> 30:59.917
supposing if you embed it in the ground

31:00.083 --> 31:04.250
and start shifting from there, what will you do with such a tree?

31:04.458 --> 31:07.208
It cannot exist, it cannot grow.

31:07.417 --> 31:11.709
So it is your own understanding that you have to take to,

31:11.917 --> 31:14.250
your own wisdom.

31:14.458 --> 31:17.083
We cannot force Sahaja Yoga on anyone,

31:17.291 --> 31:20.208
and neither we want to;

31:20.417 --> 31:24.000
nor Sahaja Yoga is going to fall at your feet

31:24.208 --> 31:28.041
and give you false ideas.

31:28.250 --> 31:32.083
Whatever it is, you see for yourself

31:32.291 --> 31:36.291
and receive the blessings of your Spirit;

31:36.500 --> 31:40.959
grow in it, understand it fully

31:41.166 --> 31:43.917
and enjoy it.

31:44.083 --> 31:48.875
This kind of state never existed in human life before.

31:49.041 --> 31:52.458
It’s a very new world I’m talking about.

31:52.667 --> 31:56.375
Wherever you go, you have to pay,

31:56.583 --> 31:59.709
and then God knows whether you enjoy it or not.

31:59.917 --> 32:04.333
But here it is within you, it’s all within you, it’s there.

32:04.542 --> 32:08.041
Only thing is that you have to know yourself.

32:08.250 --> 32:12.583
Now, in a ego-oriented personality

32:12.792 --> 32:16.083
there can be a question why Mother should do it.

32:16.291 --> 32:19.166
It’s a thankless job, I tell you.

32:19.375 --> 32:22.291
If you can do it, I’ll be very thankful to you.

32:22.500 --> 32:28.458
It’s really a thankless job in the sense that you feel so hurt

32:28.667 --> 32:32.750
when you work so hard on a person, give him realization,

32:32.959 --> 32:38.709
raise the Kundalini, really work very, very hard-

32:39.375 --> 32:42.625
and then the person just turns out to be a criminal somewhere.

32:42.834 --> 32:44.375
You just don’t know what to say.

32:44.583 --> 32:46.917
It’s like a mother who gives birth to a child,

32:47.083 --> 32:49.291
looks after the child and makes it grow,

32:49.500 --> 32:54.500
and then he ends up like a criminal. It’s very, very saddening,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.333
but doesn’t matter.

32:58.542 --> 33:02.709
Now, I started My Sahaja Yoga, as you know, with six people.

33:02.917 --> 33:07.625
For four years I was laboring with six people in England,

33:07.834 --> 33:10.792
in London - you can imagine.

33:10.999 --> 33:15.291
Then we got the seventh one, and then the eighth one.

33:15.500 --> 33:19.041
Then two ran away, so only six were left, you see.

33:19.250 --> 33:25.125
It was like the mathematical questions you get where you say,

33:25.458 --> 33:28.875
“A person came to work and he ran away second day;

33:29.041 --> 33:31.875
then another came, ran away after third day.” Same thing!

33:32.041 --> 33:33.583
I used to wonder, how can there be work

33:33.792 --> 33:36.792
and how can the work be finished, with these runaways?

33:36.999 --> 33:39.834
In Sahaja Yoga also we have such problems,

33:40.000 --> 33:44.709
but also you should know that there are people who have felt it,

33:44.917 --> 33:48.166
their own glory,

33:48.375 --> 33:51.959
and they have risen up to it and come up.

33:52.125 --> 33:56.834
From England I have great hopes, very great hopes.

33:57.000 --> 34:00.083
As I said that England is the heart of the universe,

34:00.291 --> 34:01.875
it is the heart of the universe.

34:02.125 --> 34:07.041
Specially Hampstead is what we call the jiggery,

34:07.250 --> 34:12.542
is that muscle of the heart

34:12.750 --> 34:16.083
which thrills, which thrills the heart, you see.

34:16.291 --> 34:19.959
Hampstead is even much more important.

34:20.125 --> 34:22.208
Which gives the thrills, you see.

34:22.417 --> 34:25.500
And so, I expect

34:25.709 --> 34:30.625
that we will have

34:30.834 --> 34:36.333
people of great poetic qualities

34:36.542 --> 34:40.375
and of great sanctity in this Hampstead;

34:40.583 --> 34:43.208
and where a day will come

34:43.417 --> 34:47.959
that will see the glory

34:48.125 --> 34:52.166
of God’s Love

34:52.375 --> 34:55.417
and His Kingdom

34:55.625 --> 34:58.709
born in this Hampstead.

34:58.917 --> 35:01.750
To the people who do not know about England -

35:01.959 --> 35:06.458
the deeper side of it - it’s just another country in Europe.

35:06.667 --> 35:10.542
To Me, it is not. To Me it is very important.

35:10.750 --> 35:13.667
And that’s why I’ve been working here for ten years!

35:13.875 --> 35:15.667
This is the tenth year I’m working,

35:15.875 --> 35:19.333
and I hope to do more for two years.

35:19.709 --> 35:22.917
While in India, I worked hardly for two years,

35:23.083 --> 35:27.792
but there are thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis,

35:27.999 --> 35:31.750
while here we have about thousand in London.

35:31.959 --> 35:35.625
That’s a good number to start with.

35:36.959 --> 35:41.208
So, if you have any questions you may ask Me,

35:41.417 --> 35:44.291
and then we’ll have the session of Realization.

35:44.500 --> 35:47.917
But I have to make one humble request that you should not,

35:48.083 --> 35:51.125
at the time of meditation, leave the place

35:51.333 --> 35:53.125
and behave in a very absurd manner.

35:53.333 --> 35:56.667
That’s not proper. You must respect.

35:56.875 --> 36:02.875
You must respect others who are trying to get their realization.

36:03.208 --> 36:07.750
So it’s better you leave earlier, otherwise you be civil to them

36:07.959 --> 36:10.208
and get your realization also.

36:10.417 --> 36:13.917
It may work out today, quite possible.

36:14.083 --> 36:18.750
As I have seen the other day in Brighton,

36:18.959 --> 36:21.125
they all got it in one shot.

36:21.333 --> 36:25.291
Why not in Hampstead, which, I think, is a very great place,

36:25.500 --> 36:29.999
is a very subtle, special place in the heart of the universe.

36:30.166 --> 36:34.125
So it should work out here. May God bless you!

36:34.333 --> 36:39.500
Now ask Me questions if you have any, without any fear;

36:39.709 --> 36:42.792
but not irrelevant, stupid questions, you understand that.

36:42.999 --> 36:46.041
It’s not good. I would not like to waste time

36:46.250 --> 36:50.291
of people who have come to seek the truth.

36:50.500 --> 36:52.999
So please ask Me questions if you have any,

36:53.166 --> 36:58.125
or we will go in for the Realization.

37:16.917 --> 37:22.166
No questions? Wonderful people!

37:26.792 --> 37:29.583
No questions at all?

37:29.792 --> 37:31.667
Yes, yes please.

37:31.875 --> 37:33.959
It’s not really a question, it’s just that

37:34.125 --> 37:36.166
I find it hard to hear what You are saying.

37:36.375 --> 37:39.041
Is there a way of adjusting the microphone or something?

37:39.250 --> 37:43.625
What is it? Can you come and tell Me somehow?

37:43.834 --> 37:45.417
He said he can’t hear at the back,

37:45.625 --> 37:48.542
but unfortunately the microphone is at maximum.

37:48.750 --> 37:51.625
You can’t hear?

37:51.834 --> 37:53.917
No, it seems to distort.

37:54.083 --> 37:57.291
This not all right? What did he say? I didn’t follow.

37:57.500 --> 37:59.750
Couldn’t quite hear the words.

37:59.959 --> 38:02.166
You couldn’t get any words to yourself,

38:02.375 --> 38:06.291
did you say that? Same with Me, I can’t hear you.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.542
It’s mutual, but doesn’t matter.

38:09.750 --> 38:11.583
You see, even if you have not heard Me,

38:11.792 --> 38:14.875
makes no difference, nothing.

38:15.041 --> 38:16.875
Love has no language,

38:17.041 --> 38:20.583
and this Divine Power has no language, all right?

38:20.792 --> 38:22.999
Did you understand that much?

38:23.166 --> 38:26.166
Did you follow Me, even that?

38:26.625 --> 38:32.041
I am saying that love does not require any language.

38:32.250 --> 38:36.959
It is an all-pervading power, which is everywhere

38:37.125 --> 38:43.041
and whatever may be the language, it makes no difference.

38:43.250 --> 38:47.667
It is a silent language which will work it out.

38:47.875 --> 38:50.875
I was surprised, some of the sahaja yogis who went to India

38:51.041 --> 38:53.000
were very silently meditating

38:53.208 --> 38:55.208
when I was speaking in Marathi or Hindi.

38:55.417 --> 38:59.834
And I was amazed how they were so attentive.

39:00.041 --> 39:03.083
They said, “Thank God, we did not understand, Mother,

39:03.291 --> 39:06.625
what You were saying, so we were not putting our mind into it

39:06.834 --> 39:09.792
and were just enjoying the vibrations.”

39:09.999 --> 39:14.125
Isn’t it surprising that they would sit for an hour or so

39:14.333 --> 39:18.375
just listening to Me in some foreign language?

39:18.583 --> 39:21.667
All right, doesn’t matter, right?

39:21.875 --> 39:27.125
What’s wrong with your thing, you see? Acoustics are wrong?

39:27.333 --> 39:30.417
What’s wrong? They can’t hear Me.

39:31.875 --> 39:35.875
The microphone is as loud as it can be. And I think

39:36.041 --> 39:38.750
there is probably a problem with the loudspeakers themselves.

39:38.959 --> 39:43.417
Unfortunately, we’re not able to get to the controls.

39:43.625 --> 39:46.458
We can’t get to the controls, Mother, like we can at Caxton Hall.

39:46.667 --> 39:49.834
All right?

39:50.667 --> 39:55.000
Sorry for this some sort of a mechanical problem.

39:55.208 --> 40:00.458
But doesn’t matter, the mechanics in you are perfect.

40:01.458 --> 40:04.291
I don’t know a word about this electricity business

40:04.500 --> 40:07.500
that you people have created, not a word! I don’t know how it works,

40:07.709 --> 40:12.875
but as far as your Kundalini is concerned, I’ll work it out.

40:13.041 --> 40:16.166
There’s no problem on that.

40:19.709 --> 40:22.583
All right.

40:22.792 --> 40:27.333
These acoustics, I think, of this town hall may be wrong.

40:30.333 --> 40:31.875
All right.

40:32.041 --> 40:35.250
Now what should I do if they can’t hear Me?

40:35.458 --> 40:38.458
Can you hear Me now?

40:39.041 --> 40:42.291
The gentleman? All right.

40:42.500 --> 40:45.750
I think, Mataji, one of the things is just that You have

40:45.959 --> 40:50.291
a soft voice, and at the end of the sentence Your voice disappears.

40:50.500 --> 40:51.750
With this?

40:51.959 --> 40:53.583
(...) at the end of each sentence You say

40:53.792 --> 40:55.792
there’s a fade because Your voice is soft.

40:55.999 --> 40:59.125
Softens down? My voice soften…

40:59.333 --> 41:01.500
Even when You make the points,

41:01.709 --> 41:05.500
the voice goes very soft, and we don’t hear the last words

41:05.792 --> 41:07.291
of a sentence.

41:07.500 --> 41:10.583
What about sahaja yogis, you heard Me fully?

41:10.792 --> 41:12.583
Yes.

41:12.792 --> 41:15.250
There’s a little difference.

41:15.542 --> 41:19.083
I’ll tell you. I must confess to you very humbly

41:19.291 --> 41:22.542
that when a non-sahaja yogi speaks to Me,

41:22.750 --> 41:24.999
I find it difficult to understand,

41:25.166 --> 41:28.250
but if a sahaja yogi speaks to Me, is easier.

41:28.458 --> 41:32.166
I must confess it’s a little deficiency with Me, is that -

41:32.417 --> 41:35.291
That’s why if anybody asks Me question, even in the first row,

41:35.500 --> 41:37.709
I’ll ask some sahaja yogi to tell Me what’s there,

41:37.917 --> 41:43.500
because My ears are, I think, little bit not so all right.

41:43.709 --> 41:46.375
So it is with you people also may be

41:46.583 --> 41:49.208
that, once you get your Realization - now, the sahaja yogis

41:49.417 --> 41:52.041
are sitting at the back, and they can hear Me every word.

41:52.250 --> 41:55.500
So there’s something wrong with this voice of Mine

41:55.709 --> 41:58.458
because it doesn’t adjust to your ears,

41:58.667 --> 42:01.125
for the frequencies, I think, doesn’t matter.

42:01.375 --> 42:04.166
It will work out. All right? So…

42:04.375 --> 42:07.083
The only thing, it is difficult to understand if we don’t hear.

42:07.417 --> 42:08.999
Don’t hear?

42:09.250 --> 42:11.500
Why are You saying it’s not important to understand?

42:11.709 --> 42:13.792
No, it is important to understand —

42:13.999 --> 42:17.250
but not to think about it. Forget it.

42:17.667 --> 42:20.166
Forget it, don’t think too much.

42:20.375 --> 42:24.500
Whatever you don’t have to understand, you better not understand

42:24.709 --> 42:28.667
because sometimes, you know, talking becomes a barrier,

42:28.875 --> 42:33.625
and listening is another barrier, and then thinking is the worst.

42:34.125 --> 42:39.125
All right? So let us see how it works out, all right?

42:39.333 --> 42:43.458
Let us see how it works out within.

42:47.667 --> 42:53.166
You will gradually understand what purpose My speech serves,

42:53.542 --> 42:57.792
gradually, all right? I have to speak with a purpose,

42:58.125 --> 42:59.750
but what is the purpose,

42:59.959 --> 43:02.375
that you will understand little later if you don’t mind.

43:02.583 --> 43:06.834
But just now you must understand the purpose of your life,

43:06.999 --> 43:09.208
that is your Spirit — and get to it.

43:09.417 --> 43:12.041
Now is it clear what I said?

43:12.250 --> 43:13.792
That sentence, yes.

43:13.999 --> 43:16.375
Yes, all right. Thank you.

43:16.583 --> 43:24.083
All right, let us put our hands towards

43:24.417 --> 43:28.999
Me, and Me towards you.

43:31.959 --> 43:36.542
Now - I think, you see, this also slips out.

43:37.500 --> 43:40.375
You see, I’m very bad at electrical things.

43:40.583 --> 43:45.041
I never know even how to open My radio, I’m so hopelessly bad.

43:45.250 --> 43:48.083
So, if I’m making mistakes, you should not mind,

43:48.291 --> 43:52.333
because I’m not so mechanical, you know, I don’t understand.

43:53.625 --> 43:59.458
So, what you have to do is to be relaxed in the sense

43:59.667 --> 44:03.875
that don’t put any strain on your neck or on your body

44:04.041 --> 44:08.542
but sit straight, and no strain on the neck at all.

44:08.750 --> 44:11.709
Neck, we have strained too much, so leave it in the center.

44:11.917 --> 44:15.792
Not too much at the back, not too much in front,

44:15.999 --> 44:21.667
but keep it in the center, because this neck has a problem.

44:21.875 --> 44:23.959
All right?

44:24.125 --> 44:26.917
Now, you have to stretch you hands

44:27.083 --> 44:31.375
straight like this towards Me

44:34.625 --> 44:39.250
and close your eyes. That’s all.

44:40.083 --> 44:43.417
You have to take out your spectacles if possible,

44:43.625 --> 44:46.875
because it helps also your eyes,

44:47.333 --> 44:50.333
and

44:51.667 --> 44:55.166
take out your shoes, if possible.

44:56.000 --> 45:01.834
One should not have anything tight on the waist or in the neck,

45:02.000 --> 45:05.583
little bit loosen. If it is not uncomfortable, that’s all right.

45:05.792 --> 45:08.125
If it is comfortable, then it’s all right.

45:08.333 --> 45:11.999
First thing is, you should be comfortable and not disturbed.

45:12.166 --> 45:13.875
That is the main thing.

45:14.041 --> 45:18.875
And not to have any fears, nor any guilt.

45:19.041 --> 45:23.583
That is very important not to have any guilt.

45:23.792 --> 45:27.333
Whatever I have said, I’ve not said for you.

45:27.709 --> 45:30.291
So you don’t have any guilt built in you.

45:30.500 --> 45:32.999
Just say first and foremost thing,

45:33.166 --> 45:38.291
after closing your eyes, that “Mother, I am not guilty.”

45:38.500 --> 45:41.083
Say it thrice with full confidence.

45:41.291 --> 45:44.333
I request you to say that.

45:46.417 --> 45:49.999
Please say that “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please!

45:50.166 --> 45:51.750
This is how you respect yourself.

45:51.959 --> 45:54.458
You have no business to condemn yourself

45:54.667 --> 45:58.959
because you are the temple of God.

46:02.208 --> 46:05.500
Just say it in your heart,

46:06.875 --> 46:11.083
but with full confidence, not doubting yourself at all;

46:11.291 --> 46:13.834
for My sake, please don’t doubt yourself.

46:14.000 --> 46:17.291
Just say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

46:17.500 --> 46:21.000
And forget about what you have done or anything, forget the past.

46:21.208 --> 46:23.333
I’m talking about the present at this moment.

46:23.542 --> 46:28.417
So just please say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

46:28.625 --> 46:32.750
Is a very important thing.

46:37.792 --> 46:41.375
Now, keep your eyes shut, please don’t open them,

46:41.583 --> 46:45.166
because, once the Kundalini starts rising,

46:45.375 --> 46:47.999
you have to keep your eyes closed,

46:48.166 --> 46:52.250
and the attention will be attracted inside;

46:52.458 --> 46:56.041
and after it reaches the Agnya Chakra,

46:56.250 --> 47:01.166
then you will become thoughtlessly aware.

47:01.375 --> 47:05.542
There won’t be any thoughts but you will be fully aware.

47:05.875 --> 47:08.875
So please, don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

47:09.041 --> 47:12.166
This is one thing you have to do, that’s all,

47:12.375 --> 47:16.500
not to open your eyes till I tell you.

47:17.834 --> 47:22.333
Now, the left hand should be towards Me,

47:22.542 --> 47:25.291
throughout.

47:25.500 --> 47:33.166
Left hand is symbolically indicative of your desire.

47:33.875 --> 47:40.583
And the right hand is your action.

47:46.875 --> 47:54.083
So we have to use the right hand to express our action.

47:54.291 --> 47:58.208
The first thing, as I told you, not to feel guilty,

47:58.417 --> 48:00.709
but I know you are all feeling still guilty

48:00.917 --> 48:02.959
because I can feel on your chakras.

48:03.125 --> 48:06.625
Now will you please again say it three times,

48:06.834 --> 48:08.959
otherwise you’ll be punished for thirty-two times

48:09.125 --> 48:11.291
or sixty-four times.

48:11.500 --> 48:15.875
That’s the only punishment you have to have, is to say,

48:16.041 --> 48:20.291
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

48:25.208 --> 48:29.000
Now, put the right hand on your heart,

48:29.208 --> 48:32.208
heart.

48:34.875 --> 48:39.542
Here resides the Spirit, in the heart.

48:39.750 --> 48:43.625
So, with the left hand towards Me,

48:43.959 --> 48:47.250
open towards Me,

48:47.583 --> 48:50.583
you have to say,

48:51.041 --> 48:53.875
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

48:54.041 --> 49:00.041
Ask the question: “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

49:17.583 --> 49:21.542
Now you must know, when you are the Spirit,

49:21.750 --> 49:25.792
you don’t need anybody to guide you

49:25.999 --> 49:29.041
because you’ll be enlightened by your Spirit,

49:29.250 --> 49:31.333
and the Spirit will guide you,

49:31.542 --> 49:35.208
because after Realization you develop a new awareness

49:35.417 --> 49:39.792
by which you are guided through your vibrations.

49:40.208 --> 49:42.417
So you have to put your hand down

49:42.625 --> 49:45.083
on the left-hand side of your stomach

49:45.291 --> 49:50.041
where to say,

49:50.792 --> 49:56.583
“Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide?

49:56.792 --> 50:00.166
Am I my own guru?”

50:01.959 --> 50:07.625
Anyone of these questions you can ask ten times.

50:07.834 --> 50:14.750
Establish your confidence first that you are the Spirit,

50:14.999 --> 50:20.041
which is above, detached,

50:20.500 --> 50:27.959
and is the source of joy,

50:28.500 --> 50:33.417
complete source of joy.

50:34.041 --> 50:37.250
With confidence you have to ask these questions.

50:37.458 --> 50:39.917
I am here to answer them.

50:40.083 --> 50:43.333
So please ask the question in your heart saying,

50:43.542 --> 50:49.542
“Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

50:57.458 --> 51:01.875
Put your hand on the left-hand side stomach.

51:02.041 --> 51:05.959
Here is the center for the establishment

51:06.125 --> 51:11.208
of your guru principle, your master principle.

51:11.417 --> 51:14.917
You are the master, as I say, of your body,

51:15.083 --> 51:17.458
of your mind, of your intellect.

51:17.667 --> 51:21.959
You are not to play into them, but you become the master.

51:27.333 --> 51:33.875
You don’t need any guru. You become your own guru.

51:36.166 --> 51:39.166
It's better now.

51:39.667 --> 51:44.500
Now, raise your hand again to your heart.

51:47.083 --> 51:50.583
And now, with full confidence, you say,

51:50.792 --> 51:53.542
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

51:53.750 --> 51:57.041
This you have to say twelve times

51:57.250 --> 52:03.750
because the center of the heart has got twelve petals.

52:03.959 --> 52:07.291
You have to say it twelve times:

52:08.125 --> 52:12.999
“Mother, I am the Spirit”, with full confidence

52:13.166 --> 52:16.500
and respect of yourself - which you are.

52:16.709 --> 52:23.792
You are the Spirit, no doubt, but just assert!

52:32.000 --> 52:37.041
That is how we are clearing our centers.

52:39.417 --> 52:46.792
Now, raise your right hand to your left side

52:48.959 --> 52:51.458
at the base of your neck.

52:51.667 --> 52:57.667
This is another center which gets caught up when we feel guilty.

52:58.208 --> 53:04.667
Now, those who have said that “I am the Spirit,”

53:04.875 --> 53:10.000
you must know that Spirit can never be guilty of anything.

53:10.208 --> 53:14.542
It is a sinless,

53:15.291 --> 53:17.834
beautiful,

53:18.000 --> 53:20.834
brilliant diamond within you.

53:21.000 --> 53:24.458
It cannot get contaminated by any guilt.

53:24.667 --> 53:29.291
So you have to say now here eight times:

53:29.500 --> 53:34.999
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

53:35.625 --> 53:42.041
For those who have always felt guilty, can say sixteen times.

54:21.792 --> 54:25.208
Now, raise this hand on top of your head

54:25.417 --> 54:27.750
and put it at the fontanel bone area,

54:27.959 --> 54:30.625
which was a soft part in your childhood,

54:30.834 --> 54:35.291
and put your palm on top of it, on top of it, let it rest.

54:35.500 --> 54:38.625
And now move the head in a clockwise manner,

54:38.834 --> 54:40.333
pressing it down with your palm.

54:40.542 --> 54:43.417
Just press it down and move it in a clockwise manner.

54:43.625 --> 54:46.375
If you do it from the side, you’ll do it better.

54:46.583 --> 54:48.542
Hold it from the side.

54:48.750 --> 54:54.208
Put your hand sideways, not from front, you do it better.

54:54.417 --> 54:57.417
And now turn it,

54:57.875 --> 55:03.000
little bit pressing it down with your palm.

55:03.208 --> 55:09.041
Turn your hand, not your head.

55:11.999 --> 55:17.834
At this point, again, your freedom is to be respected.

55:18.000 --> 55:20.458
I cannot cross over it.

55:20.667 --> 55:23.999
So you have to say that you want your Realization.

55:24.166 --> 55:28.083
You can say, “Mother, I want my Realization.

55:28.291 --> 55:31.625
Please, may I have the Realization?”

55:31.834 --> 55:37.959
Please say it seven times, just pressing it.

55:40.375 --> 55:43.458
You must touch your head. It’s all hot, you can see that,

55:43.667 --> 55:45.458
the heat is coming out.

55:45.667 --> 55:47.834
You must touch it and press it down,

55:48.000 --> 55:51.750
and see such a lot of heat is coming out.

56:00.542 --> 56:05.291
Now, seven times you have to say it.

56:05.500 --> 56:07.709
After that, you can raise your hand

56:07.917 --> 56:10.834
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

56:11.000 --> 56:13.917
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost!

56:14.250 --> 56:15.500
So you can ask a question,

56:15.709 --> 56:17.667
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

56:17.875 --> 56:19.208
Every one of you.

56:19.417 --> 56:22.667
You can change your hands now. You can use the left hand.

56:22.875 --> 56:25.875
Put the right hand towards Me.

56:26.709 --> 56:28.959
Keep your eyes shut and ask the question:

56:29.125 --> 56:33.667
“Mother, is this the breeze?”

56:38.709 --> 56:41.333
All of you should get it.

56:41.542 --> 56:44.500
Possible! Change your hands again if you want to.

56:44.709 --> 56:48.917
You go on changing and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

56:49.083 --> 56:52.041
It has to be cool breeze. First the heat will come out,

56:52.250 --> 56:55.458
so it’s a good sign that the heat is going out,

56:55.667 --> 57:00.083
all the heat with tension and all that is going out.

57:06.291 --> 57:09.166
It’s working out. It’s very subtle.

57:09.375 --> 57:12.000
We are moving from gross awareness

57:12.208 --> 57:14.875
to a subtler awareness of the roots.

57:15.041 --> 57:20.291
So naturally, one has to pay attention to it.

57:20.500 --> 57:23.041
Little in front, it is not at the back of the head

57:23.250 --> 57:26.667
but little bit in the front side.

57:26.875 --> 57:32.999
Try one after another and pay attention to it.

57:53.000 --> 57:56.000
Very hot today!

58:37.250 --> 58:41.542
Now, without opening the eyes, again put back hands towards Me

58:41.750 --> 58:43.542
like this,

58:43.750 --> 58:46.834
and see if there’s a cool breeze

58:47.000 --> 58:50.125
coming to your fingertips, to begin with.

58:50.333 --> 58:56.375
Just put both the hands and see if there’s a cool breeze.

59:00.291 --> 59:02.500
Ask again the question:

59:02.709 --> 59:07.834
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

59:08.500 --> 59:14.917
Ask thrice. Means the Kundalini. Kundalini is the Holy Ghost.

59:16.208 --> 59:19.208
How is the lady?

59:21.709 --> 59:24.959
It’s all right. Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

59:25.125 --> 59:30.166
She’ll be all right, don’t worry. Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

59:30.625 --> 59:33.834
Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

59:34.000 --> 59:36.875
She’ll be all right. Don’t worry, I’m looking after her.

59:37.041 --> 59:40.041
She’s come.

59:42.917 --> 59:45.917
She’ll be all right.

59:54.000 --> 59:57.000
Now, if you are getting cool breeze in the hand,

59:57.208 --> 59:59.917
you can also now see it if you raise your hands.

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:04.458
Open your eyes and raise your hands. Slowly open your eyes, slowly.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:07.542
Raise your hands like this.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:12.709
Like this, as much as you can stretch, let’s see.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:22.041
Are you feeling?

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:28.250
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.792
Are you feeling the cool breeze now?

01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:39.875
Those who are feeling should say, “Yes.”

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:43.041
Yes.

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:46.875
All right. Now just put your hands like that

01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:52.375
and see now if you are feeling the cool breeze.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:57.875
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.917
Just enjoy yourself. Close your eyes.

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:04.999
At this time, there are sahaja yogis here,

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:10.500
who will help you to completely establish the experience

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:16.166
and to see if there are any obstacles.

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:20.999
So sahaja yogis should do it very carefully, without talking,

01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:25.291
and raise the Kundalini if necessary in some people.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.291
Don’t talk to them, don’t touch them,

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.959
just start raising the Kundalini.

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:35.959
Slowly, try to do it.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.250
Keep your eyes shut. We’ll work it out for you.

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:42.125
Now, those who have come for the first time

01:01:42.333 --> 01:01:46.500
and have felt the cool breeze, raise your hands first of all.

01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:48.999
First time who have come and felt the cool breeze,

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:52.291
raise your hands, higher.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:57.999
Yah, good. It’s good.

01:01:58.166 --> 01:02:01.083
So, please put down.

01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:05.208
Did you see them? Can you work on them and see?

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:11.041
Now. And those who have not felt, please raise your hands.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:16.041
At all. The cool breeze.

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:20.375
For the first time who have come and have not felt the cool breeze,

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.500
raise your hand.

01:02:23.709 --> 01:02:28.125
Markus? Who’s there? Has he felt the cool breeze there?

01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:33.125
Helen, behind you the gentleman, who could not hear Me?

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.750
All right, then it’s all right, it’s done.

01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:38.333
Now, just see the people who have not felt the cool breeze.

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:41.250
Please, raise your hands please.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:47.166
This one gentleman, this lady, this gentleman…
