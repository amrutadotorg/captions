00:00:26.458 --> 00:00:33.999
At the very outset I would like to apologize for being so late today

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:38.917
but I realized that

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:42.083
that when something is very important

00:00:42.291 --> 00:00:44.750
from God’s point of view,

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:48.959
all the negative forces work out their plans,

00:00:49.125 --> 00:00:53.333
how to delay, how to put obstructions,

00:00:53.542 --> 00:00:56.917
how to bring hindrances, how to deviate.

00:00:57.083 --> 00:00:59.500
It’s very surprising.

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:05.125
And today, I think would be best if I tell you

00:01:12.959 --> 00:01:17.417
about God’s will and how we human beings

00:01:17.625 --> 00:01:21.208
try to go against it all the time.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:26.250
God’s will is extremely simple.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:31.250
He is

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.667
Divine Love.

00:01:38.291 --> 00:01:41.542
He is Compassion.

00:01:42.208 --> 00:01:45.542
He is Ocean of Mercy.

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:52.208
And in His mercy and in compassion He created this world,

00:01:52.792 --> 00:01:55.750
and then created human beings,

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:58.959
just to give them

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:04.083
the highest thing in life: joy.

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:07.834
Joy, which is single thing;

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500
it does not have duality,

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.583
like sorrow, unhappiness,

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.625
like day and night.

00:02:23.125 --> 00:02:28.208
But how we are anti-joy

00:02:28.417 --> 00:02:34.417
and anti-God,

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:39.667
and why it happens, we’ll have to see that.

00:02:41.291 --> 00:02:44.500
Our awareness, as you know, grows

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.000
through our brain,

00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:50.208
downward;

00:02:50.458 --> 00:02:54.999
and whatever starts growing downward,

00:02:55.166 --> 00:03:01.125
makes us away from God,

00:03:01.417 --> 00:03:03.500
in a way.

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.500
Ultimately we have to achieve God,

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:11.166
but first we go little bit away from that awareness

00:03:11.375 --> 00:03:14.542
of being one with God,

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.041
just to understand that freedom

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.208
has to be used properly.

00:03:23.417 --> 00:03:28.542
Without that training, without that education,

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:31.542
no use giving freedom to human beings.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.959
You have seen the “free” countries, what have they achieved?

00:03:37.125 --> 00:03:39.709
In their freedom, what have we achieved?

00:03:39.917 --> 00:03:44.083
Atom bombs to kill ourselves! I mean it is stupid,

00:03:44.291 --> 00:03:47.625
it’s foolish, it's absurd!

00:03:48.917 --> 00:03:50.917
But we have done it, and we are proud of it,

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:52.875
and still we are busy how to make it

00:03:53.041 --> 00:03:55.166
even worse and worse and worse, but what's that?

00:03:55.375 --> 00:03:58.291
This is how we move.

00:03:59.792 --> 00:04:04.333
The awareness that was our own human awareness

00:04:04.542 --> 00:04:09.000
was given to us for freedom,

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:13.166
to be tested, to be experimented, to be seen —

00:04:13.625 --> 00:04:16.875
and then to have ultimate freedom

00:04:17.041 --> 00:04:19.500
by which you become the Spirit.

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.709
You have to become the Spirit ultimately.

00:04:25.291 --> 00:04:29.250
But as we start growing in our awareness, so-called,

00:04:29.458 --> 00:04:34.333
our concern is not for the Spirit.

00:04:34.542 --> 00:04:36.999
I would say, like a tree,

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:41.875
which embeds itself into its roots.

00:04:42.041 --> 00:04:45.709
And the roots that we have are in the brain.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.375
And then we start growing,

00:04:48.583 --> 00:04:52.792
upward, upward, and upward,

00:04:53.291 --> 00:04:56.500
till the leaves are created, fruits are created,

00:04:56.709 --> 00:04:59.709
flowers are created.

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:06.250
On the contrary, before reaching the fruit stage,

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:13.999
what happens to us - that we start creating artificial leaves

00:05:14.333 --> 00:05:17.208
and enjoying them.

00:05:17.417 --> 00:05:19.458
We take to artificiality.

00:05:19.667 --> 00:05:23.625
Once this identification of artificiality starts,

00:05:23.834 --> 00:05:27.875
we start going away from reality

00:05:28.041 --> 00:05:31.917
to negative thoughts, or to over-positive thoughts

00:05:32.083 --> 00:05:35.792
by which we make atom bombs and all that —

00:05:35.999 --> 00:05:41.291
so-called positive thoughts, which are actually anti-God.

00:05:42.083 --> 00:05:46.834
So there are two branches really

00:05:47.291 --> 00:05:49.834
in life that we branch off.

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:55.875
Some people like to go towards the left side of negative attitude,

00:05:56.041 --> 00:06:02.041
by which they injure themselves, trouble themselves,

00:06:02.999 --> 00:06:06.542
do all kinds of things by which they can die,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:09.041
in the most miserable manner;

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:12.959
get all kinds of diseases upon themselves,

00:06:13.125 --> 00:06:17.625
torture their body, torture everything that they have.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000
And the another side is on the right-hand side, where they move

00:06:22.208 --> 00:06:27.166
to torture others, to destroy others, to overpower others.

00:06:27.375 --> 00:06:33.375
Both ways we are away from God, and His mercy, and His grace.

00:06:34.917 --> 00:06:39.625
The concern should be throughout towards the Spirit,

00:06:39.834 --> 00:06:46.333
then the movement is in the right direction.

00:06:47.291 --> 00:06:52.208
But this concern breaks up very easily in human beings

00:06:52.417 --> 00:06:54.458
because they are free to do it.

00:06:54.667 --> 00:06:59.999
In their ego they just break it; the connection, they break it.

00:07:01.083 --> 00:07:08.375
So much so that when you develop artificial ways of enjoying life,

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:14.625
then even the consciousness of God is lost —

00:07:15.083 --> 00:07:19.291
that He exists, that He has created us,

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.500
that He is the One

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.208
who is running the show.

00:07:27.417 --> 00:07:30.709
We become so conscious of ourselves

00:07:30.917 --> 00:07:35.083
that we think there’s nothing wrong.

00:07:35.291 --> 00:07:40.625
We do this, we do that, plunge into all kinds of problems;

00:07:40.834 --> 00:07:44.542
and we don’t understand that what we are doing

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.959
is against ourselves, and “ourselves” means against God,

00:07:48.125 --> 00:07:50.625
because God has created us, He loves us.

00:07:50.834 --> 00:07:53.834
We don’t love ourselves.

00:07:54.917 --> 00:07:59.750
If we had loved ourselves, we would not have ruined our own body,

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:02.834
our own systems, everything that we have,

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:06.625
by saying, “What’s wrong? Why not do it?”

00:08:06.834 --> 00:08:10.041
You must love this body of yours,

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:13.333
this mind of yours,

00:08:14.417 --> 00:08:16.458
your society.

00:08:16.959 --> 00:08:21.750
Everything you have to love because God has created you in His love.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:26.583
But the love itself has become such a perverted word now.

00:08:27.375 --> 00:08:31.250
“What is wrong in promiscuousness? It is love.”

00:08:31.792 --> 00:08:37.667
If I tell that “No, it is not, because it is against nature.

00:08:37.875 --> 00:08:42.999
It gives you trouble; you will be in a mess.

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:45.542
Listen to Me, it’s not proper,”

00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:50.458
then people think that “This Lady is very matronly,

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:54.875
She is very old-fashioned, Victorian.”

00:08:55.041 --> 00:09:00.999
But it’s a fact. Why do things which will destroy you?

00:09:01.166 --> 00:09:03.375
You can’t create yourself; you can’t even create

00:09:03.583 --> 00:09:06.542
a nose for yourself, leave alone the whole body.

00:09:06.750 --> 00:09:12.583
Then why should we be anti ourselves, first of all?

00:09:12.792 --> 00:09:17.083
Then why should we be anti the society that we have created,

00:09:17.291 --> 00:09:19.959
then against the whole nation that we have created,

00:09:20.125 --> 00:09:22.999
and nations, and nations, and nations?

00:09:23.166 --> 00:09:26.166
What are they doing, these all these politicians today?

00:09:26.375 --> 00:09:29.583
Fighting for what? I just look at them, I can’t understand

00:09:29.792 --> 00:09:31.792
what’s the matter with these people?

00:09:31.999 --> 00:09:35.417
Fighting to create more destructive forces,

00:09:35.625 --> 00:09:40.542
more horrible things to destroy innocent human beings?

00:09:40.917 --> 00:09:44.625
Those who are innocent are simply worried.

00:09:44.834 --> 00:09:47.667
They don’t know what to do.

00:09:47.875 --> 00:09:53.709
They don’t understand why they are to be dead tomorrow

00:09:53.917 --> 00:09:56.792
because some people have gone off their heads.

00:09:56.999 --> 00:09:59.417
And those who have gone off their heads are sitting

00:09:59.625 --> 00:10:01.792
at the helm of affairs,

00:10:02.041 --> 00:10:04.125
and we select them and elect them,

00:10:04.333 --> 00:10:08.041
all such people who are sitting at the helm of affairs.

00:10:10.583 --> 00:10:13.333
That’s how the negativity grows within us;

00:10:13.542 --> 00:10:15.583
we become negative.

00:10:15.792 --> 00:10:20.125
Both things are negative attitude because they negate God.

00:10:20.333 --> 00:10:24.125
Negation of God is the first crime we have created.

00:10:24.333 --> 00:10:28.999
We are not afraid of that God, awe for Him.

00:10:29.417 --> 00:10:32.709
He is Compassion. He is Mercy. He is everything.

00:10:32.917 --> 00:10:36.875
But in His mercy only He’s going to destroy the world.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:42.542
He won’t allow you to commit more sins against Him.

00:10:43.208 --> 00:10:48.999
He destroys - even - otherwise from within.

00:10:49.458 --> 00:10:51.625
What is cancer?

00:10:51.834 --> 00:10:55.250
What are all these diseases that are coming in our body?

00:10:55.458 --> 00:10:58.000
They are nothing but our own destruction forces

00:10:58.208 --> 00:11:01.166
that we ourselves have built within ourselves,

00:11:01.375 --> 00:11:04.250
are breaking through.

00:11:04.458 --> 00:11:08.625
There is no fear from outside invasion,

00:11:08.834 --> 00:11:12.500
or from any star, or from any

00:11:12.834 --> 00:11:17.625
extraterrestrial attack.

00:11:17.834 --> 00:11:22.500
No, there is not. It is within us.

00:11:22.709 --> 00:11:27.375
The attack is built within us, of which we should be aware.

00:11:27.583 --> 00:11:32.041
In the name of freedom we have collected within ourselves

00:11:32.250 --> 00:11:36.041
all the germs of our destruction.

00:11:36.875 --> 00:11:41.125
It is such a built-in

00:11:42.709 --> 00:11:46.458
process within us that we are not even aware

00:11:46.667 --> 00:11:51.458
that they are growing, that they are there.

00:11:51.667 --> 00:11:56.875
We are quite satisfied with ourselves, with our artificial life,

00:11:57.041 --> 00:12:00.709
with our so-called

00:12:00.917 --> 00:12:04.458
etiquettes and superficial mannerism.

00:12:04.667 --> 00:12:07.917
Innately within us

00:12:08.375 --> 00:12:11.458
there resides the Spirit

00:12:11.667 --> 00:12:15.583
which wants to enlighten you,

00:12:15.792 --> 00:12:17.792
which is anxious to enlighten you,

00:12:17.999 --> 00:12:22.041
to give you the peace, the bliss, the joy of your being.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:27.000
This beautiful lamp of yours which is being created,

00:12:27.583 --> 00:12:30.792
is with a great purpose.

00:12:30.999 --> 00:12:34.250
It has to be enlightened. Respect yourself!

00:12:34.458 --> 00:12:38.208
There is no “respect” word left in the dictionary today.

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:42.083
Respect yourself!

00:12:42.375 --> 00:12:46.583
We have to respect this lamp,

00:12:46.792 --> 00:12:51.583
which has the light of the Spirit, that it should be enlightened;

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:56.125
and let us be that lamp, that shows the path

00:12:56.333 --> 00:12:59.625
of glorification of your being.

00:12:59.834 --> 00:13:04.834
And in that light we can see God’s Glory too.

00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.542
It’s such a beautiful world He has created for us.

00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:13.917
Everything He has given us,

00:13:14.375 --> 00:13:18.875
but we in our ignorance and in so-called freedom

00:13:19.041 --> 00:13:23.583
have ruined so many things.

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:27.417
It is sometimes shocking to see how people are going

00:13:27.625 --> 00:13:30.999
just towards hell directly.

00:13:31.166 --> 00:13:34.792
For a Mother it is a thing of great concern:

00:13:34.999 --> 00:13:40.375
How to stop this pull? How to get them out of it?

00:13:40.959 --> 00:13:46.792
how to make them understand what is your worth, what is your value?

00:13:47.458 --> 00:13:50.917
You don’t take human life for granted.

00:13:51.083 --> 00:13:53.333
It is a very precious life

00:13:53.542 --> 00:13:58.667
created out of many processes.

00:13:58.875 --> 00:14:02.125
With great difficulty it was created.

00:14:02.333 --> 00:14:06.333
Don’t forget that you have to become the Spirit.

00:14:06.583 --> 00:14:09.500
Without that, your life is just a waste,

00:14:09.709 --> 00:14:11.709
the whole creation is a waste.

00:14:11.959 --> 00:14:15.041
Because you are the highest in the creation!

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:20.834
You are the epitome of the creation, and what are you up to?

00:14:21.333 --> 00:14:23.709
We have to form nucleuses

00:14:23.917 --> 00:14:29.333
who will talk about Spirit now openly, about God.

00:14:29.542 --> 00:14:32.875
I was amazed to hear that in this country

00:14:33.041 --> 00:14:35.166
people don’t like to talk about God.

00:14:35.417 --> 00:14:37.417
You cannot talk about God.

00:14:37.667 --> 00:14:39.917
As soon as you say “God” — “Oh nothing! God?

00:14:40.083 --> 00:14:43.125
That’s religion. That’s nothing to do with me.”

00:14:43.333 --> 00:14:45.875
Can you imagine such a state of affair

00:14:46.041 --> 00:14:48.250
where you cannot talk about your Creator?

00:14:48.458 --> 00:14:54.333
Either you form some sort of a closed, secretive organization

00:14:54.542 --> 00:14:56.875
where everybody can not enter into,

00:14:57.041 --> 00:15:01.041
and say, “Now, we belong to certain cult of God.”

00:15:01.250 --> 00:15:04.250
How can God have cults?

00:15:06.166 --> 00:15:10.583
Just think of it. How can He have separate churches,

00:15:10.834 --> 00:15:14.834
and separate temples and mosques? How can He have?

00:15:15.125 --> 00:15:19.375
How can we become fanatic in the name of God? Can you imagine?

00:15:19.583 --> 00:15:23.500
This is what we have done to God! We have become fanatic.

00:15:24.125 --> 00:15:26.166
There’s a stone;

00:15:26.375 --> 00:15:29.417
that stone, when it touches anything, it becomes gold.

00:15:29.625 --> 00:15:32.333
But there must be a stone, when it touches human beings,

00:15:32.542 --> 00:15:36.625
they become like prisons.

00:15:37.125 --> 00:15:40.333
That’s why there is so much fanaticism.

00:15:40.542 --> 00:15:43.458
It’s a problem today.

00:15:43.667 --> 00:15:46.333
How to break this news and message

00:15:46.542 --> 00:15:51.999
that you are the Spirit and you have to become the Spirit?

00:15:52.166 --> 00:15:54.750
There is a Marathi poet called Namdev.

00:15:54.959 --> 00:15:58.125
Because my mother tongue is Marathi,

00:15:58.333 --> 00:16:02.875
and thank God I have been born in Maharashtra -

00:16:03.041 --> 00:16:05.417
because it’s a country of saints,

00:16:05.625 --> 00:16:08.166
thousands of saints lived in that country.

00:16:08.375 --> 00:16:10.917
It’s the tradition, is so spiritual!

00:16:11.083 --> 00:16:13.208
Spirituality is the tradition of that place

00:16:13.417 --> 00:16:15.750
where I was born in that Maharashtra, called -

00:16:15.959 --> 00:16:19.166
“maha” means the great and “rashtra” means the nation.

00:16:19.375 --> 00:16:22.417
I don’t know why they thought of it, but I feel that way

00:16:22.625 --> 00:16:26.500
that the tradition is of spirituality,

00:16:27.375 --> 00:16:31.083
not of alcoholism, or drugism,

00:16:31.291 --> 00:16:34.875
or call any other “isms” as they are.

00:16:35.083 --> 00:16:38.667
But of spirituality is the tradition in that country

00:16:38.875 --> 00:16:43.667
where a very simple poet called Namdev - he was a tailor,

00:16:43.875 --> 00:16:46.291
himself was just a tailor, ordinary,

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.999
and he said, has written a very sweet poem,

00:16:50.166 --> 00:16:54.000
which I will just tell you the explain what he says.

00:16:54.208 --> 00:16:57.250
He says that a little boy

00:16:57.458 --> 00:17:02.959
is flying a kite in the sky.

00:17:03.125 --> 00:17:06.500
He’s looking at the sky, he’s talking to his friends,

00:17:06.709 --> 00:17:08.834
he’s moving upward and downward,

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:11.542
and he’s discussing things here and there -

00:17:11.750 --> 00:17:15.917
but his attention is on the kite.

00:17:16.834 --> 00:17:21.083
Then he says a lady who is carrying her little baby

00:17:21.291 --> 00:17:26.041
is doing the work in the house; she’s giving water to her husband;

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:30.542
and she is also sitting down and cooking,

00:17:30.750 --> 00:17:33.083
and then she’s getting up to wash something;

00:17:33.291 --> 00:17:39.291
the child is on her waist, resting -

00:17:39.834 --> 00:17:44.542
but her attention is all the time on the child.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:50.333
There’s a lady who is walking with a pitcher of water on her head.

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:53.000
She’s walking with many other ladies;

00:17:53.208 --> 00:17:56.959
they are all walking together laughing, smiling,

00:17:57.125 --> 00:18:00.208
young ladies talking to each other

00:18:01.041 --> 00:18:03.709
and discussing things -

00:18:03.917 --> 00:18:07.625
but their attention is on their Spirit,

00:18:07.834 --> 00:18:12.250
in the sense it is on that pitcher of water.

00:18:12.458 --> 00:18:17.041
In the same way, we, though we have to lead a life here,

00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:19.667
of other things,

00:18:19.875 --> 00:18:24.208
it is absurd that we do not have our attention on our Spirit,

00:18:24.417 --> 00:18:29.166
which is the giver of joy - the ultimate in life.

00:18:31.333 --> 00:18:34.999
But as soon as you start talking about something like that,

00:18:35.166 --> 00:18:38.250
people think that it is something trash,

00:18:38.458 --> 00:18:40.583
not to be listened to. Most surprising!

00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:44.125
They want to hear the same mundane things again and again.

00:18:44.333 --> 00:18:47.834
You see, if it is a broadcast by, say, Conservative Party,

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.417
or Labor Party, or another party, or any other party,

00:18:50.625 --> 00:18:53.583
they’ll listen to it for hours together.

00:18:53.792 --> 00:18:57.250
It’s such a mundane stuff, every year you hear that.

00:18:57.458 --> 00:19:02.041
But if somebody says that “No, this is all artificial.

00:19:03.583 --> 00:19:08.542
You have something much more within you, rise to that point,”

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:11.333
they think it is something… “We have not come to hear

00:19:11.542 --> 00:19:14.999
all these things, what is this Mother telling us?”

00:19:15.959 --> 00:19:19.125
But now awaken and arise!

00:19:19.333 --> 00:19:23.166
On a different level we have to come to, to understand

00:19:23.375 --> 00:19:27.375
that what these people have done so far - and we have accepted it,

00:19:27.583 --> 00:19:30.291
we have taken it for granted all these years -

00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:33.999
has done no good to us.

00:19:34.291 --> 00:19:38.333
We have to rise above this to see: there is, beyond the horizon,

00:19:38.542 --> 00:19:43.041
a star shining within us, and that is our Spirit.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:46.250
People have talked about it, made another cult.

00:19:46.458 --> 00:19:49.041
Talk about God, made another cult.

00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:52.000
This time I saw one thing in the BBC,

00:19:52.208 --> 00:19:55.834
they showed a cult which says, “We are doing God’s work.”

00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.166
Doing God’s work? And the ladies

00:19:58.375 --> 00:20:01.125
are tying up their thighs with thorns and things,

00:20:01.333 --> 00:20:04.917
and hurting themselves, cutting their flesh.

00:20:05.083 --> 00:20:07.667
And the explanation is - just imagine, in the name of God

00:20:07.875 --> 00:20:09.500
doing such horrible stuff -

00:20:09.709 --> 00:20:13.959
and the explanation is that “You must

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:17.750
have mortification.”

00:20:18.083 --> 00:20:21.417
Why? Why should you have?

00:20:21.625 --> 00:20:25.125
“Because Christ did it.” Are you Christ?

00:20:25.333 --> 00:20:28.291
And that means Christ, whatever He did is waste.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:32.667
Little bit of yours was needed to add.

00:20:32.875 --> 00:20:35.709
Whatever He is done is more than sufficient

00:20:35.917 --> 00:20:40.500
because He was the Prince.

00:20:40.709 --> 00:20:44.917
And if a prince has to go through the mortification,

00:20:45.083 --> 00:20:48.083
it’s a very great thing.

00:20:49.291 --> 00:20:54.250
Not for a beggar to go through the mortification, what is so great?

00:20:54.458 --> 00:20:57.417
He’s already done it.

00:20:57.625 --> 00:21:00.709
He has worked for us.

00:21:00.917 --> 00:21:05.125
He’s just to be enlightened within us,

00:21:06.500 --> 00:21:11.208
and that’s how we have to get to our realization.

00:21:12.250 --> 00:21:17.792
Now to sit down and to question

00:21:17.999 --> 00:21:20.999
is very easy.

00:21:21.792 --> 00:21:27.000
That’s the easiest thing to do, is to sit down and ask questions.

00:21:27.999 --> 00:21:31.417
But best is to get to it,

00:21:31.625 --> 00:21:33.875
to get your realization.

00:21:34.041 --> 00:21:37.000
That is the most important thing today.

00:21:37.208 --> 00:21:40.709
Of course, under the circumstances,

00:21:40.917 --> 00:21:45.417
as the human beings are, it is not going to work very fast.

00:21:45.625 --> 00:21:50.291
I’m sure of it. I have tried My level best.

00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.917
Like mountains you have to raise the Kundalini,

00:21:53.083 --> 00:21:57.917
really like mountains; you feel so tired and fagged out.

00:21:58.083 --> 00:22:01.542
But then they don’t want to appreciate it,

00:22:01.750 --> 00:22:04.875
so, not to feel disappointed,

00:22:05.041 --> 00:22:08.542
not to feel hurt about it.

00:22:08.750 --> 00:22:13.750
Slowly and steadily, I am sure,

00:22:13.959 --> 00:22:17.083
in your own eyes people will see the light.

00:22:17.291 --> 00:22:20.458
People will see how your life is transformed

00:22:20.667 --> 00:22:23.750
into joy and bliss and understanding.

00:22:23.959 --> 00:22:29.500
They will see how loving and dignified you have become,

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.917
and then they are going to believe

00:22:33.083 --> 00:22:36.875
that there is a better life for you.

00:22:37.667 --> 00:22:40.333
The state is so bad for some people;

00:22:40.542 --> 00:22:45.458
they see, as I told you, a black picture of the whole thing.

00:22:45.667 --> 00:22:50.458
They are so disappointed that they have given up.

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:54.000
They have just given up, they said, “Now we’ve finished with this.

00:22:54.208 --> 00:22:57.125
We’ve done everything now. We don’t want to do any more.”

00:22:57.333 --> 00:23:01.083
I’ve seen in France many people are sitting outside and discussing

00:23:01.291 --> 00:23:04.959
that “When are we going to have now the ten stars

00:23:05.125 --> 00:23:08.375
meeting together to collapse this world, once for all.”

00:23:08.583 --> 00:23:10.583
They are discussing

00:23:10.792 --> 00:23:13.959
that “Let us be finished soon now. We have had enough of it.

00:23:14.125 --> 00:23:16.917
Let’s have the ultimate destruction, whether it was atom bomb

00:23:17.083 --> 00:23:20.208
or anything, let us be finished, had enough of it.”

00:23:20.417 --> 00:23:22.583
It is so desperate.

00:23:22.792 --> 00:23:27.250
I can understand their desperation, those who are thinking about it,

00:23:27.458 --> 00:23:31.208
those who are concerned about it and bothered about it,

00:23:31.417 --> 00:23:33.999
no doubt one would feel desperate.

00:23:34.166 --> 00:23:37.500
Even the Sahaja Yogis sometimes get very upset

00:23:37.709 --> 00:23:41.500
and get extremely desperate and they say, “Give up, Mother.

00:23:41.709 --> 00:23:45.291
Just we’ve finished with it. Now no more!”

00:23:46.333 --> 00:23:50.291
But I don’t know how to remove My attention

00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.208
from the Spirit.

00:23:53.417 --> 00:23:56.291
If you can try, you try your level best to remove it,

00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:58.458
you cannot. Now you are there.

00:23:58.667 --> 00:24:02.417
So, whatever it is, till the last breath of your life

00:24:02.625 --> 00:24:07.250
you will fight to save as many as possible.

00:24:07.458 --> 00:24:11.999
So, all those sahaja yogis who got very frustrated

00:24:12.166 --> 00:24:17.208
in certain endeavors, I have to say — you should not be frustrated.

00:24:17.417 --> 00:24:19.792
You have to keep your courage

00:24:19.999 --> 00:24:24.917
and understanding that if you have feeling for others,

00:24:25.125 --> 00:24:29.083
and if you really show your concern to them,

00:24:29.333 --> 00:24:32.291
they will understand you and will be able

00:24:32.625 --> 00:24:36.542
to get more and more people saved, emancipated,

00:24:37.125 --> 00:24:41.917
and they will enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:24:42.083 --> 00:24:46.333
As you are enjoying, they will also enjoy.

00:24:46.542 --> 00:24:49.458
Only snag in the enjoyment is that you feel

00:24:49.667 --> 00:24:53.625
that so many are still lost. Doesn’t matter.

00:24:53.834 --> 00:24:57.709
That has to be made up. We have to work hard.

00:24:57.917 --> 00:25:01.083
We have to understand that there are negative forces

00:25:01.375 --> 00:25:03.041
which are pulling them down.

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:07.041
They are ignorant; they do not know beyond this life

00:25:07.250 --> 00:25:13.250
resides the eternal life of beauty and glory.

00:25:13.709 --> 00:25:16.625
But gradually, I am sure, it will work out.

00:25:16.834 --> 00:25:19.583
Specially for this meeting,

00:25:19.792 --> 00:25:22.375
they had lots of ups and downs,

00:25:22.583 --> 00:25:27.166
and whole thing was very discouraging.

00:25:27.375 --> 00:25:31.625
But still — one must understand

00:25:31.834 --> 00:25:34.625
that God’s work is blessed by God.

00:25:34.834 --> 00:25:38.625
He will render all His help,

00:25:38.917 --> 00:25:43.625
all His blessings on you,

00:25:43.834 --> 00:25:49.750
to enrich you, to enable you to perform your divine duties.

00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:57.500
The time

00:25:57.709 --> 00:26:00.125
is passing.

00:26:00.333 --> 00:26:03.333
Very little time left;

00:26:03.542 --> 00:26:05.583
it’s running out,

00:26:05.792 --> 00:26:10.500
and that’s why the desperation is more in people.

00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.500
This desperation itself has brought forth

00:26:17.083 --> 00:26:21.291
the advent of Sahaja Yoga on this earth,

00:26:22.375 --> 00:26:28.125
and you should feel more

00:26:29.458 --> 00:26:33.000
stronger to fight

00:26:34.208 --> 00:26:37.999
these obstructions that you feel around,

00:26:38.166 --> 00:26:41.166
and should work out

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:46.583
the ultimate goal of this creation.

00:26:46.792 --> 00:26:49.792
May God bless you!

00:26:52.208 --> 00:26:55.875
I would request

00:26:56.917 --> 00:27:02.250
people to be seated now

00:27:02.458 --> 00:27:05.208
for a while

00:27:05.417 --> 00:27:11.417
because we should try to get our Realization now.

00:27:13.583 --> 00:27:19.041
One should have little time for oneself.

00:27:21.834 --> 00:27:27.000
There is no limit of time in Sahaja Yoga.

00:27:27.208 --> 00:27:30.999
Whenever the Kundalini has to rise, She rises.

00:27:31.166 --> 00:27:35.166
May be today, may be tomorrow, may be day after.

00:27:35.375 --> 00:27:39.375
Whenever you have to get your realization, it works out.

00:27:39.583 --> 00:27:43.083
Only thing is we can expedite it,

00:27:43.291 --> 00:27:49.000
we can work harder to cleanse the path to achieve it.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:54.250
But we must make a start now, and once it works out,

00:27:54.458 --> 00:27:58.625
then it is easy to handle it and to go further.

00:27:58.834 --> 00:28:04.083
I’m sure John must have told you about the Kundalini.

00:28:04.291 --> 00:28:07.583
Moreover, you can take the books from here.

00:28:07.792 --> 00:28:10.208
There are little books published for the first people

00:28:10.417 --> 00:28:12.750
who are coming to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:12.959 --> 00:28:16.875
It looks very complicated - it is not.

00:28:17.083 --> 00:28:20.583
Like the switch here,

00:28:20.792 --> 00:28:26.792
which can put all the lights to their enlightenment,

00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:29.500
in the same way there’s a switch within you

00:28:29.709 --> 00:28:31.875
which is called as the Kundalini.

00:28:32.041 --> 00:28:35.417
And all this machinery is not to be bothered about.

00:28:35.625 --> 00:28:38.959
Once you get your realization, the whole thing becomes very easy,

00:28:39.125 --> 00:28:41.125
and you can get to it.

00:28:41.333 --> 00:28:43.625
Of course, you know you can’t pay for it.

00:28:43.834 --> 00:28:47.625
It’s very low-level business to pay for it.

00:28:47.834 --> 00:28:51.792
People don’t understand that how can you pay for God’s love!

00:28:51.999 --> 00:28:54.000
They can’t understand, this is beyond their mind,

00:28:54.208 --> 00:28:56.999
because whatever they have got today - even the air -

00:28:57.166 --> 00:28:59.917
they have to pay for it.

00:29:00.083 --> 00:29:03.709
And you cannot put in any effort,

00:29:03.917 --> 00:29:11.333
or you cannot put in any pain

00:29:11.542 --> 00:29:16.458
or any troublesome things for yourself.

00:29:16.667 --> 00:29:20.041
Moreover, there is complete freedom for you.

00:29:20.250 --> 00:29:23.166
We cannot bind you by writing down

00:29:23.375 --> 00:29:25.875
a sort of your name in the ledger,

00:29:26.041 --> 00:29:29.750
and then making you a member and giving you a member card.

00:29:29.959 --> 00:29:32.333
There is nothing like that in Sahaja Yoga is possible.

00:29:32.542 --> 00:29:35.583
You can see it very clear, it is not possible -

00:29:35.792 --> 00:29:40.375
if you understand on what level I’m talking.

00:29:40.625 --> 00:29:45.083
You are absolutely free to get your realization,

00:29:45.291 --> 00:29:49.375
absolutely free to move further with it;

00:29:49.583 --> 00:29:52.875
and even, at that moment, if you want to leave,

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:55.959
you are absolutely free to leave.

00:29:56.125 --> 00:30:02.083
There’s nobody who is going to ask you to come back.

00:30:02.291 --> 00:30:07.000
It is your own desire, it is your own wish

00:30:07.208 --> 00:30:09.959
and it is your free will

00:30:10.125 --> 00:30:13.417
that is going to be respected.

00:30:13.625 --> 00:30:18.333
So nobody should think that we have a membership like a cult has,

00:30:18.542 --> 00:30:22.208
or there is any fear that “If we get out of Sahaja Yoga,

00:30:22.417 --> 00:30:26.834
then these people will catch hold of our necks and bring it back.”

00:30:28.041 --> 00:30:31.000
So, it is not so.

00:30:31.208 --> 00:30:36.959
It is a welcoming place and also it has an exit door.

00:30:37.125 --> 00:30:40.291
Some people just get through one door and get out,

00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:44.625
like a shuttle. No problem. It’s all right for us.

00:30:44.834 --> 00:30:48.750
On the contrary, one feels relieved with such people

00:30:48.959 --> 00:30:53.375
because if they cannot stick on, they cannot get to Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:53.583 --> 00:30:55.959
Like any tree,

00:30:56.125 --> 00:30:59.917
supposing if you embed it in the ground

00:31:00.083 --> 00:31:04.250
and start shifting from there, what will you do with such a tree?

00:31:04.458 --> 00:31:07.208
It cannot exist, it cannot grow.

00:31:07.417 --> 00:31:11.709
So it is your own understanding that you have to take to,

00:31:11.917 --> 00:31:14.250
your own wisdom.

00:31:14.458 --> 00:31:17.083
We cannot force Sahaja Yoga on anyone,

00:31:17.291 --> 00:31:20.208
and neither we want to;

00:31:20.417 --> 00:31:24.000
nor Sahaja Yoga is going to fall at your feet

00:31:24.208 --> 00:31:28.041
and give you false ideas.

00:31:28.250 --> 00:31:32.083
Whatever it is, you see for yourself

00:31:32.291 --> 00:31:36.291
and receive the blessings of your Spirit;

00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:40.959
grow in it, understand it fully

00:31:41.166 --> 00:31:43.917
and enjoy it.

00:31:44.083 --> 00:31:48.875
This kind of state never existed in human life before.

00:31:49.041 --> 00:31:52.458
It’s a very new world I’m talking about.

00:31:52.667 --> 00:31:56.375
Wherever you go, you have to pay,

00:31:56.583 --> 00:31:59.709
and then God knows whether you enjoy it or not.

00:31:59.917 --> 00:32:04.333
But here it is within you, it’s all within you, it’s there.

00:32:04.542 --> 00:32:08.041
Only thing is that you have to know yourself.

00:32:08.250 --> 00:32:12.583
Now, in a ego-oriented personality

00:32:12.792 --> 00:32:16.083
there can be a question why Mother should do it.

00:32:16.291 --> 00:32:19.166
It’s a thankless job, I tell you.

00:32:19.375 --> 00:32:22.291
If you can do it, I’ll be very thankful to you.

00:32:22.500 --> 00:32:28.458
It’s really a thankless job in the sense that you feel so hurt

00:32:28.667 --> 00:32:32.750
when you work so hard on a person, give him realization,

00:32:32.959 --> 00:32:38.709
raise the Kundalini, really work very, very hard-

00:32:39.375 --> 00:32:42.625
and then the person just turns out to be a criminal somewhere.

00:32:42.834 --> 00:32:44.375
You just don’t know what to say.

00:32:44.583 --> 00:32:46.917
It’s like a mother who gives birth to a child,

00:32:47.083 --> 00:32:49.291
looks after the child and makes it grow,

00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:54.500
and then he ends up like a criminal. It’s very, very saddening,

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.333
but doesn’t matter.

00:32:58.542 --> 00:33:02.709
Now, I started My Sahaja Yoga, as you know, with six people.

00:33:02.917 --> 00:33:07.625
For four years I was laboring with six people in England,

00:33:07.834 --> 00:33:10.792
in London - you can imagine.

00:33:10.999 --> 00:33:15.291
Then we got the seventh one, and then the eighth one.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:19.041
Then two ran away, so only six were left, you see.

00:33:19.250 --> 00:33:25.125
It was like the mathematical questions you get where you say,

00:33:25.458 --> 00:33:28.875
“A person came to work and he ran away second day;

00:33:29.041 --> 00:33:31.875
then another came, ran away after third day.” Same thing!

00:33:32.041 --> 00:33:33.583
I used to wonder, how can there be work

00:33:33.792 --> 00:33:36.792
and how can the work be finished, with these runaways?

00:33:36.999 --> 00:33:39.834
In Sahaja Yoga also we have such problems,

00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.709
but also you should know that there are people who have felt it,

00:33:44.917 --> 00:33:48.166
their own glory,

00:33:48.375 --> 00:33:51.959
and they have risen up to it and come up.

00:33:52.125 --> 00:33:56.834
From England I have great hopes, very great hopes.

00:33:57.000 --> 00:34:00.083
As I said that England is the heart of the universe,

00:34:00.291 --> 00:34:01.875
it is the heart of the universe.

00:34:02.125 --> 00:34:07.041
Specially Hampstead is what we call the jiggery,

00:34:07.250 --> 00:34:12.542
is that muscle of the heart

00:34:12.750 --> 00:34:16.083
which thrills, which thrills the heart, you see.

00:34:16.291 --> 00:34:19.959
Hampstead is even much more important.

00:34:20.125 --> 00:34:22.208
Which gives the thrills, you see.

00:34:22.417 --> 00:34:25.500
And so, I expect

00:34:25.709 --> 00:34:30.625
that we will have

00:34:30.834 --> 00:34:36.333
people of great poetic qualities

00:34:36.542 --> 00:34:40.375
and of great sanctity in this Hampstead;

00:34:40.583 --> 00:34:43.208
and where a day will come

00:34:43.417 --> 00:34:47.959
that will see the glory

00:34:48.125 --> 00:34:52.166
of God’s Love

00:34:52.375 --> 00:34:55.417
and His Kingdom

00:34:55.625 --> 00:34:58.709
born in this Hampstead.

00:34:58.917 --> 00:35:01.750
To the people who do not know about England -

00:35:01.959 --> 00:35:06.458
the deeper side of it - it’s just another country in Europe.

00:35:06.667 --> 00:35:10.542
To Me, it is not. To Me it is very important.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:13.667
And that’s why I’ve been working here for ten years!

00:35:13.875 --> 00:35:15.667
This is the tenth year I’m working,

00:35:15.875 --> 00:35:19.333
and I hope to do more for two years.

00:35:19.709 --> 00:35:22.917
While in India, I worked hardly for two years,

00:35:23.083 --> 00:35:27.792
but there are thousands and thousands of Sahaja Yogis,

00:35:27.999 --> 00:35:31.750
while here we have about thousand in London.

00:35:31.959 --> 00:35:35.625
That’s a good number to start with.

00:35:36.959 --> 00:35:41.208
So, if you have any questions you may ask Me,

00:35:41.417 --> 00:35:44.291
and then we’ll have the session of Realization.

00:35:44.500 --> 00:35:47.917
But I have to make one humble request that you should not,

00:35:48.083 --> 00:35:51.125
at the time of meditation, leave the place

00:35:51.333 --> 00:35:53.125
and behave in a very absurd manner.

00:35:53.333 --> 00:35:56.667
That’s not proper. You must respect.

00:35:56.875 --> 00:36:02.875
You must respect others who are trying to get their realization.

00:36:03.208 --> 00:36:07.750
So it’s better you leave earlier, otherwise you be civil to them

00:36:07.959 --> 00:36:10.208
and get your realization also.

00:36:10.417 --> 00:36:13.917
It may work out today, quite possible.

00:36:14.083 --> 00:36:18.750
As I have seen the other day in Brighton,

00:36:18.959 --> 00:36:21.125
they all got it in one shot.

00:36:21.333 --> 00:36:25.291
Why not in Hampstead, which, I think, is a very great place,

00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:29.999
is a very subtle, special place in the heart of the universe.

00:36:30.166 --> 00:36:34.125
So it should work out here. May God bless you!

00:36:34.333 --> 00:36:39.500
Now ask Me questions if you have any, without any fear;

00:36:39.709 --> 00:36:42.792
but not irrelevant, stupid questions, you understand that.

00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:46.041
It’s not good. I would not like to waste time

00:36:46.250 --> 00:36:50.291
of people who have come to seek the truth.

00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:52.999
So please ask Me questions if you have any,

00:36:53.166 --> 00:36:58.125
or we will go in for the Realization.

00:37:16.917 --> 00:37:22.166
No questions? Wonderful people!

00:37:26.792 --> 00:37:29.583
No questions at all?

00:37:29.792 --> 00:37:31.667
Yes, yes please.

00:37:31.875 --> 00:37:33.959
It’s not really a question, it’s just that

00:37:34.125 --> 00:37:36.166
I find it hard to hear what You are saying.

00:37:36.375 --> 00:37:39.041
Is there a way of adjusting the microphone or something?

00:37:39.250 --> 00:37:43.625
What is it? Can you come and tell Me somehow?

00:37:43.834 --> 00:37:45.417
He said he can’t hear at the back,

00:37:45.625 --> 00:37:48.542
but unfortunately the microphone is at maximum.

00:37:48.750 --> 00:37:51.625
You can’t hear?

00:37:51.834 --> 00:37:53.917
No, it seems to distort.

00:37:54.083 --> 00:37:57.291
This not all right? What did he say? I didn’t follow.

00:37:57.500 --> 00:37:59.750
Couldn’t quite hear the words.

00:37:59.959 --> 00:38:02.166
You couldn’t get any words to yourself,

00:38:02.375 --> 00:38:06.291
did you say that? Same with Me, I can’t hear you.

00:38:07.875 --> 00:38:09.542
It’s mutual, but doesn’t matter.

00:38:09.750 --> 00:38:11.583
You see, even if you have not heard Me,

00:38:11.792 --> 00:38:14.875
makes no difference, nothing.

00:38:15.041 --> 00:38:16.875
Love has no language,

00:38:17.041 --> 00:38:20.583
and this Divine Power has no language, all right?

00:38:20.792 --> 00:38:22.999
Did you understand that much?

00:38:23.166 --> 00:38:26.166
Did you follow Me, even that?

00:38:26.625 --> 00:38:32.041
I am saying that love does not require any language.

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:36.959
It is an all-pervading power, which is everywhere

00:38:37.125 --> 00:38:43.041
and whatever may be the language, it makes no difference.

00:38:43.250 --> 00:38:47.667
It is a silent language which will work it out.

00:38:47.875 --> 00:38:50.875
I was surprised, some of the sahaja yogis who went to India

00:38:51.041 --> 00:38:53.000
were very silently meditating

00:38:53.208 --> 00:38:55.208
when I was speaking in Marathi or Hindi.

00:38:55.417 --> 00:38:59.834
And I was amazed how they were so attentive.

00:39:00.041 --> 00:39:03.083
They said, “Thank God, we did not understand, Mother,

00:39:03.291 --> 00:39:06.625
what You were saying, so we were not putting our mind into it

00:39:06.834 --> 00:39:09.792
and were just enjoying the vibrations.”

00:39:09.999 --> 00:39:14.125
Isn’t it surprising that they would sit for an hour or so

00:39:14.333 --> 00:39:18.375
just listening to Me in some foreign language?

00:39:18.583 --> 00:39:21.667
All right, doesn’t matter, right?

00:39:21.875 --> 00:39:27.125
What’s wrong with your thing, you see? Acoustics are wrong?

00:39:27.333 --> 00:39:30.417
What’s wrong? They can’t hear Me.

00:39:31.875 --> 00:39:35.875
The microphone is as loud as it can be. And I think

00:39:36.041 --> 00:39:38.750
there is probably a problem with the loudspeakers themselves.

00:39:38.959 --> 00:39:43.417
Unfortunately, we’re not able to get to the controls.

00:39:43.625 --> 00:39:46.458
We can’t get to the controls, Mother, like we can at Caxton Hall.

00:39:46.667 --> 00:39:49.834
All right?

00:39:50.667 --> 00:39:55.000
Sorry for this some sort of a mechanical problem.

00:39:55.208 --> 00:40:00.458
But doesn’t matter, the mechanics in you are perfect.

00:40:01.458 --> 00:40:04.291
I don’t know a word about this electricity business

00:40:04.500 --> 00:40:07.500
that you people have created, not a word! I don’t know how it works,

00:40:07.709 --> 00:40:12.875
but as far as your Kundalini is concerned, I’ll work it out.

00:40:13.041 --> 00:40:16.166
There’s no problem on that.

00:40:19.709 --> 00:40:22.583
All right.

00:40:22.792 --> 00:40:27.333
These acoustics, I think, of this town hall may be wrong.

00:40:30.333 --> 00:40:31.875
All right.

00:40:32.041 --> 00:40:35.250
Now what should I do if they can’t hear Me?

00:40:35.458 --> 00:40:38.458
Can you hear Me now?

00:40:39.041 --> 00:40:42.291
The gentleman? All right.

00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:45.750
I think, Mataji, one of the things is just that You have

00:40:45.959 --> 00:40:50.291
a soft voice, and at the end of the sentence Your voice disappears.

00:40:50.500 --> 00:40:51.750
With this?

00:40:51.959 --> 00:40:53.583
(...) at the end of each sentence You say

00:40:53.792 --> 00:40:55.792
there’s a fade because Your voice is soft.

00:40:55.999 --> 00:40:59.125
Softens down? My voice soften…

00:40:59.333 --> 00:41:01.500
Even when You make the points,

00:41:01.709 --> 00:41:05.500
the voice goes very soft, and we don’t hear the last words

00:41:05.792 --> 00:41:07.291
of a sentence.

00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.583
What about sahaja yogis, you heard Me fully?

00:41:10.792 --> 00:41:12.583
Yes.

00:41:12.792 --> 00:41:15.250
There’s a little difference.

00:41:15.542 --> 00:41:19.083
I’ll tell you. I must confess to you very humbly

00:41:19.291 --> 00:41:22.542
that when a non-sahaja yogi speaks to Me,

00:41:22.750 --> 00:41:24.999
I find it difficult to understand,

00:41:25.166 --> 00:41:28.250
but if a sahaja yogi speaks to Me, is easier.

00:41:28.458 --> 00:41:32.166
I must confess it’s a little deficiency with Me, is that -

00:41:32.417 --> 00:41:35.291
That’s why if anybody asks Me question, even in the first row,

00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.709
I’ll ask some sahaja yogi to tell Me what’s there,

00:41:37.917 --> 00:41:43.500
because My ears are, I think, little bit not so all right.

00:41:43.709 --> 00:41:46.375
So it is with you people also may be

00:41:46.583 --> 00:41:49.208
that, once you get your Realization - now, the sahaja yogis

00:41:49.417 --> 00:41:52.041
are sitting at the back, and they can hear Me every word.

00:41:52.250 --> 00:41:55.500
So there’s something wrong with this voice of Mine

00:41:55.709 --> 00:41:58.458
because it doesn’t adjust to your ears,

00:41:58.667 --> 00:42:01.125
for the frequencies, I think, doesn’t matter.

00:42:01.375 --> 00:42:04.166
It will work out. All right? So…

00:42:04.375 --> 00:42:07.083
The only thing, it is difficult to understand if we don’t hear.

00:42:07.417 --> 00:42:08.999
Don’t hear?

00:42:09.250 --> 00:42:11.500
Why are You saying it’s not important to understand?

00:42:11.709 --> 00:42:13.792
No, it is important to understand —

00:42:13.999 --> 00:42:17.250
but not to think about it. Forget it.

00:42:17.667 --> 00:42:20.166
Forget it, don’t think too much.

00:42:20.375 --> 00:42:24.500
Whatever you don’t have to understand, you better not understand

00:42:24.709 --> 00:42:28.667
because sometimes, you know, talking becomes a barrier,

00:42:28.875 --> 00:42:33.625
and listening is another barrier, and then thinking is the worst.

00:42:34.125 --> 00:42:39.125
All right? So let us see how it works out, all right?

00:42:39.333 --> 00:42:43.458
Let us see how it works out within.

00:42:47.667 --> 00:42:53.166
You will gradually understand what purpose My speech serves,

00:42:53.542 --> 00:42:57.792
gradually, all right? I have to speak with a purpose,

00:42:58.125 --> 00:42:59.750
but what is the purpose,

00:42:59.959 --> 00:43:02.375
that you will understand little later if you don’t mind.

00:43:02.583 --> 00:43:06.834
But just now you must understand the purpose of your life,

00:43:06.999 --> 00:43:09.208
that is your Spirit — and get to it.

00:43:09.417 --> 00:43:12.041
Now is it clear what I said?

00:43:12.250 --> 00:43:13.792
That sentence, yes.

00:43:13.999 --> 00:43:16.375
Yes, all right. Thank you.

00:43:16.583 --> 00:43:24.083
All right, let us put our hands towards

00:43:24.417 --> 00:43:28.999
Me, and Me towards you.

00:43:31.959 --> 00:43:36.542
Now - I think, you see, this also slips out.

00:43:37.500 --> 00:43:40.375
You see, I’m very bad at electrical things.

00:43:40.583 --> 00:43:45.041
I never know even how to open My radio, I’m so hopelessly bad.

00:43:45.250 --> 00:43:48.083
So, if I’m making mistakes, you should not mind,

00:43:48.291 --> 00:43:52.333
because I’m not so mechanical, you know, I don’t understand.

00:43:53.625 --> 00:43:59.458
So, what you have to do is to be relaxed in the sense

00:43:59.667 --> 00:44:03.875
that don’t put any strain on your neck or on your body

00:44:04.041 --> 00:44:08.542
but sit straight, and no strain on the neck at all.

00:44:08.750 --> 00:44:11.709
Neck, we have strained too much, so leave it in the center.

00:44:11.917 --> 00:44:15.792
Not too much at the back, not too much in front,

00:44:15.999 --> 00:44:21.667
but keep it in the center, because this neck has a problem.

00:44:21.875 --> 00:44:23.959
All right?

00:44:24.125 --> 00:44:26.917
Now, you have to stretch you hands

00:44:27.083 --> 00:44:31.375
straight like this towards Me

00:44:34.625 --> 00:44:39.250
and close your eyes. That’s all.

00:44:40.083 --> 00:44:43.417
You have to take out your spectacles if possible,

00:44:43.625 --> 00:44:46.875
because it helps also your eyes,

00:44:47.333 --> 00:44:50.333
and

00:44:51.667 --> 00:44:55.166
take out your shoes, if possible.

00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:01.834
One should not have anything tight on the waist or in the neck,

00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.583
little bit loosen. If it is not uncomfortable, that’s all right.

00:45:05.792 --> 00:45:08.125
If it is comfortable, then it’s all right.

00:45:08.333 --> 00:45:11.999
First thing is, you should be comfortable and not disturbed.

00:45:12.166 --> 00:45:13.875
That is the main thing.

00:45:14.041 --> 00:45:18.875
And not to have any fears, nor any guilt.

00:45:19.041 --> 00:45:23.583
That is very important not to have any guilt.

00:45:23.792 --> 00:45:27.333
Whatever I have said, I’ve not said for you.

00:45:27.709 --> 00:45:30.291
So you don’t have any guilt built in you.

00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:32.999
Just say first and foremost thing,

00:45:33.166 --> 00:45:38.291
after closing your eyes, that “Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.083
Say it thrice with full confidence.

00:45:41.291 --> 00:45:44.333
I request you to say that.

00:45:46.417 --> 00:45:49.999
Please say that “Mother, I am not guilty.” Please!

00:45:50.166 --> 00:45:51.750
This is how you respect yourself.

00:45:51.959 --> 00:45:54.458
You have no business to condemn yourself

00:45:54.667 --> 00:45:58.959
because you are the temple of God.

00:46:02.208 --> 00:46:05.500
Just say it in your heart,

00:46:06.875 --> 00:46:11.083
but with full confidence, not doubting yourself at all;

00:46:11.291 --> 00:46:13.834
for My sake, please don’t doubt yourself.

00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.291
Just say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:21.000
And forget about what you have done or anything, forget the past.

00:46:21.208 --> 00:46:23.333
I’m talking about the present at this moment.

00:46:23.542 --> 00:46:28.417
So just please say, “Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:46:28.625 --> 00:46:32.750
Is a very important thing.

00:46:37.792 --> 00:46:41.375
Now, keep your eyes shut, please don’t open them,

00:46:41.583 --> 00:46:45.166
because, once the Kundalini starts rising,

00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:47.999
you have to keep your eyes closed,

00:46:48.166 --> 00:46:52.250
and the attention will be attracted inside;

00:46:52.458 --> 00:46:56.041
and after it reaches the Agnya Chakra,

00:46:56.250 --> 00:47:01.166
then you will become thoughtlessly aware.

00:47:01.375 --> 00:47:05.542
There won’t be any thoughts but you will be fully aware.

00:47:05.875 --> 00:47:08.875
So please, don’t open your eyes till I tell you.

00:47:09.041 --> 00:47:12.166
This is one thing you have to do, that’s all,

00:47:12.375 --> 00:47:16.500
not to open your eyes till I tell you.

00:47:17.834 --> 00:47:22.333
Now, the left hand should be towards Me,

00:47:22.542 --> 00:47:25.291
throughout.

00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:33.166
Left hand is symbolically indicative of your desire.

00:47:33.875 --> 00:47:40.583
And the right hand is your action.

00:47:46.875 --> 00:47:54.083
So we have to use the right hand to express our action.

00:47:54.291 --> 00:47:58.208
The first thing, as I told you, not to feel guilty,

00:47:58.417 --> 00:48:00.709
but I know you are all feeling still guilty

00:48:00.917 --> 00:48:02.959
because I can feel on your chakras.

00:48:03.125 --> 00:48:06.625
Now will you please again say it three times,

00:48:06.834 --> 00:48:08.959
otherwise you’ll be punished for thirty-two times

00:48:09.125 --> 00:48:11.291
or sixty-four times.

00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:15.875
That’s the only punishment you have to have, is to say,

00:48:16.041 --> 00:48:20.291
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:29.000
Now, put the right hand on your heart,

00:48:29.208 --> 00:48:32.208
heart.

00:48:34.875 --> 00:48:39.542
Here resides the Spirit, in the heart.

00:48:39.750 --> 00:48:43.625
So, with the left hand towards Me,

00:48:43.959 --> 00:48:47.250
open towards Me,

00:48:47.583 --> 00:48:50.583
you have to say,

00:48:51.041 --> 00:48:53.875
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:48:54.041 --> 00:49:00.041
Ask the question: “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:49:17.583 --> 00:49:21.542
Now you must know, when you are the Spirit,

00:49:21.750 --> 00:49:25.792
you don’t need anybody to guide you

00:49:25.999 --> 00:49:29.041
because you’ll be enlightened by your Spirit,

00:49:29.250 --> 00:49:31.333
and the Spirit will guide you,

00:49:31.542 --> 00:49:35.208
because after Realization you develop a new awareness

00:49:35.417 --> 00:49:39.792
by which you are guided through your vibrations.

00:49:40.208 --> 00:49:42.417
So you have to put your hand down

00:49:42.625 --> 00:49:45.083
on the left-hand side of your stomach

00:49:45.291 --> 00:49:50.041
where to say,

00:49:50.792 --> 00:49:56.583
“Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guide?

00:49:56.792 --> 00:50:00.166
Am I my own guru?”

00:50:01.959 --> 00:50:07.625
Anyone of these questions you can ask ten times.

00:50:07.834 --> 00:50:14.750
Establish your confidence first that you are the Spirit,

00:50:14.999 --> 00:50:20.041
which is above, detached,

00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:27.959
and is the source of joy,

00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:33.417
complete source of joy.

00:50:34.041 --> 00:50:37.250
With confidence you have to ask these questions.

00:50:37.458 --> 00:50:39.917
I am here to answer them.

00:50:40.083 --> 00:50:43.333
So please ask the question in your heart saying,

00:50:43.542 --> 00:50:49.542
“Mother, am I my own master? Am I my own guru?”

00:50:57.458 --> 00:51:01.875
Put your hand on the left-hand side stomach.

00:51:02.041 --> 00:51:05.959
Here is the center for the establishment

00:51:06.125 --> 00:51:11.208
of your guru principle, your master principle.

00:51:11.417 --> 00:51:14.917
You are the master, as I say, of your body,

00:51:15.083 --> 00:51:17.458
of your mind, of your intellect.

00:51:17.667 --> 00:51:21.959
You are not to play into them, but you become the master.

00:51:27.333 --> 00:51:33.875
You don’t need any guru. You become your own guru.

00:51:36.166 --> 00:51:39.166
It's better now.

00:51:39.667 --> 00:51:44.500
Now, raise your hand again to your heart.

00:51:47.083 --> 00:51:50.583
And now, with full confidence, you say,

00:51:50.792 --> 00:51:53.542
“Mother, I am the Spirit.”

00:51:53.750 --> 00:51:57.041
This you have to say twelve times

00:51:57.250 --> 00:52:03.750
because the center of the heart has got twelve petals.

00:52:03.959 --> 00:52:07.291
You have to say it twelve times:

00:52:08.125 --> 00:52:12.999
“Mother, I am the Spirit”, with full confidence

00:52:13.166 --> 00:52:16.500
and respect of yourself - which you are.

00:52:16.709 --> 00:52:23.792
You are the Spirit, no doubt, but just assert!

00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:37.041
That is how we are clearing our centers.

00:52:39.417 --> 00:52:46.792
Now, raise your right hand to your left side

00:52:48.959 --> 00:52:51.458
at the base of your neck.

00:52:51.667 --> 00:52:57.667
This is another center which gets caught up when we feel guilty.

00:52:58.208 --> 00:53:04.667
Now, those who have said that “I am the Spirit,”

00:53:04.875 --> 00:53:10.000
you must know that Spirit can never be guilty of anything.

00:53:10.208 --> 00:53:14.542
It is a sinless,

00:53:15.291 --> 00:53:17.834
beautiful,

00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.834
brilliant diamond within you.

00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.458
It cannot get contaminated by any guilt.

00:53:24.667 --> 00:53:29.291
So you have to say now here eight times:

00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:34.999
“Mother, I am not guilty.”

00:53:35.625 --> 00:53:42.041
For those who have always felt guilty, can say sixteen times.

00:54:21.792 --> 00:54:25.208
Now, raise this hand on top of your head

00:54:25.417 --> 00:54:27.750
and put it at the fontanel bone area,

00:54:27.959 --> 00:54:30.625
which was a soft part in your childhood,

00:54:30.834 --> 00:54:35.291
and put your palm on top of it, on top of it, let it rest.

00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:38.625
And now move the head in a clockwise manner,

00:54:38.834 --> 00:54:40.333
pressing it down with your palm.

00:54:40.542 --> 00:54:43.417
Just press it down and move it in a clockwise manner.

00:54:43.625 --> 00:54:46.375
If you do it from the side, you’ll do it better.

00:54:46.583 --> 00:54:48.542
Hold it from the side.

00:54:48.750 --> 00:54:54.208
Put your hand sideways, not from front, you do it better.

00:54:54.417 --> 00:54:57.417
And now turn it,

00:54:57.875 --> 00:55:03.000
little bit pressing it down with your palm.

00:55:03.208 --> 00:55:09.041
Turn your hand, not your head.

00:55:11.999 --> 00:55:17.834
At this point, again, your freedom is to be respected.

00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.458
I cannot cross over it.

00:55:20.667 --> 00:55:23.999
So you have to say that you want your Realization.

00:55:24.166 --> 00:55:28.083
You can say, “Mother, I want my Realization.

00:55:28.291 --> 00:55:31.625
Please, may I have the Realization?”

00:55:31.834 --> 00:55:37.959
Please say it seven times, just pressing it.

00:55:40.375 --> 00:55:43.458
You must touch your head. It’s all hot, you can see that,

00:55:43.667 --> 00:55:45.458
the heat is coming out.

00:55:45.667 --> 00:55:47.834
You must touch it and press it down,

00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:51.750
and see such a lot of heat is coming out.

00:56:00.542 --> 00:56:05.291
Now, seven times you have to say it.

00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.709
After that, you can raise your hand

00:56:07.917 --> 00:56:10.834
and see if there’s a cool breeze coming in.

00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:13.917
This is the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost!

00:56:14.250 --> 00:56:15.500
So you can ask a question,

00:56:15.709 --> 00:56:17.667
“Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:56:17.875 --> 00:56:19.208
Every one of you.

00:56:19.417 --> 00:56:22.667
You can change your hands now. You can use the left hand.

00:56:22.875 --> 00:56:25.875
Put the right hand towards Me.

00:56:26.709 --> 00:56:28.959
Keep your eyes shut and ask the question:

00:56:29.125 --> 00:56:33.667
“Mother, is this the breeze?”

00:56:38.709 --> 00:56:41.333
All of you should get it.

00:56:41.542 --> 00:56:44.500
Possible! Change your hands again if you want to.

00:56:44.709 --> 00:56:48.917
You go on changing and see if there’s a cool breeze coming out.

00:56:49.083 --> 00:56:52.041
It has to be cool breeze. First the heat will come out,

00:56:52.250 --> 00:56:55.458
so it’s a good sign that the heat is going out,

00:56:55.667 --> 00:57:00.083
all the heat with tension and all that is going out.

00:57:06.291 --> 00:57:09.166
It’s working out. It’s very subtle.

00:57:09.375 --> 00:57:12.000
We are moving from gross awareness

00:57:12.208 --> 00:57:14.875
to a subtler awareness of the roots.

00:57:15.041 --> 00:57:20.291
So naturally, one has to pay attention to it.

00:57:20.500 --> 00:57:23.041
Little in front, it is not at the back of the head

00:57:23.250 --> 00:57:26.667
but little bit in the front side.

00:57:26.875 --> 00:57:32.999
Try one after another and pay attention to it.

00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:56.000
Very hot today!

00:58:37.250 --> 00:58:41.542
Now, without opening the eyes, again put back hands towards Me

00:58:41.750 --> 00:58:43.542
like this,

00:58:43.750 --> 00:58:46.834
and see if there’s a cool breeze

00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:50.125
coming to your fingertips, to begin with.

00:58:50.333 --> 00:58:56.375
Just put both the hands and see if there’s a cool breeze.

00:59:00.291 --> 00:59:02.500
Ask again the question:

00:59:02.709 --> 00:59:07.834
“Is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?”

00:59:08.500 --> 00:59:14.917
Ask thrice. Means the Kundalini. Kundalini is the Holy Ghost.

00:59:16.208 --> 00:59:19.208
How is the lady?

00:59:21.709 --> 00:59:24.959
It’s all right. Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

00:59:25.125 --> 00:59:30.166
She’ll be all right, don’t worry. Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

00:59:30.625 --> 00:59:33.834
Don’t worry, she’ll be all right.

00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.875
She’ll be all right. Don’t worry, I’m looking after her.

00:59:37.041 --> 00:59:40.041
She’s come.

00:59:42.917 --> 00:59:45.917
She’ll be all right.

00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:57.000
Now, if you are getting cool breeze in the hand,

00:59:57.208 --> 00:59:59.917
you can also now see it if you raise your hands.

01:00:00.083 --> 01:00:04.458
Open your eyes and raise your hands. Slowly open your eyes, slowly.

01:00:04.667 --> 01:00:07.542
Raise your hands like this.

01:00:07.750 --> 01:00:12.709
Like this, as much as you can stretch, let’s see.

01:00:19.041 --> 01:00:22.041
Are you feeling?

01:00:25.250 --> 01:00:28.250
Are you feeling the cool breeze?

01:00:30.583 --> 01:00:33.792
Are you feeling the cool breeze now?

01:00:37.792 --> 01:00:39.875
Those who are feeling should say, “Yes.”

01:00:40.041 --> 01:00:43.041
Yes.

01:00:43.625 --> 01:00:46.875
All right. Now just put your hands like that

01:00:47.041 --> 01:00:52.375
and see now if you are feeling the cool breeze.

01:00:55.667 --> 01:00:57.875
Close your eyes and enjoy yourself.

01:00:58.041 --> 01:01:00.917
Just enjoy yourself. Close your eyes.

01:01:01.083 --> 01:01:04.999
At this time, there are sahaja yogis here,

01:01:05.166 --> 01:01:10.500
who will help you to completely establish the experience

01:01:10.709 --> 01:01:16.166
and to see if there are any obstacles.

01:01:16.375 --> 01:01:20.999
So sahaja yogis should do it very carefully, without talking,

01:01:21.166 --> 01:01:25.291
and raise the Kundalini if necessary in some people.

01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:28.291
Don’t talk to them, don’t touch them,

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:32.959
just start raising the Kundalini.

01:01:33.417 --> 01:01:35.959
Slowly, try to do it.

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:39.250
Keep your eyes shut. We’ll work it out for you.

01:01:39.458 --> 01:01:42.125
Now, those who have come for the first time

01:01:42.333 --> 01:01:46.500
and have felt the cool breeze, raise your hands first of all.

01:01:46.709 --> 01:01:48.999
First time who have come and felt the cool breeze,

01:01:49.208 --> 01:01:52.291
raise your hands, higher.

01:01:52.625 --> 01:01:57.999
Yah, good. It’s good.

01:01:58.166 --> 01:02:01.083
So, please put down.

01:02:01.291 --> 01:02:05.208
Did you see them? Can you work on them and see?

01:02:05.417 --> 01:02:11.041
Now. And those who have not felt, please raise your hands.

01:02:11.583 --> 01:02:16.041
At all. The cool breeze.

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:20.375
For the first time who have come and have not felt the cool breeze,

01:02:20.583 --> 01:02:23.500
raise your hand.

01:02:23.709 --> 01:02:28.125
Markus? Who’s there? Has he felt the cool breeze there?

01:02:28.333 --> 01:02:33.125
Helen, behind you the gentleman, who could not hear Me?

01:02:33.625 --> 01:02:35.750
All right, then it’s all right, it’s done.

01:02:35.959 --> 01:02:38.333
Now, just see the people who have not felt the cool breeze.

01:02:38.542 --> 01:02:41.250
Please, raise your hands please.

01:02:41.458 --> 01:02:47.166
This one gentleman, this lady, this gentleman…
