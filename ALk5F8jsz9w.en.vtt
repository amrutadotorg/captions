00:15.940 --> 00:30.980
I bow to all the seekers of Truth. This song
that you are listening to has been written

00:30.990 --> 00:41.390
by a poet called Namadeva about sixteenth
century and what he’s singing there is,

00:41.390 --> 00:59.239
“Oh, Mother, give me my yoga.” Yoga means
the union with the Divine.

00:59.239 --> 01:11.070
I said I bow to you all because you’re seekers
of Truth. At the very outset, one has to know

01:11.070 --> 01:22.520
that Truth is what it is. You cannot change
it. You cannot transform it. You cannot conceptualize

01:22.520 --> 01:35.130
it. And, unfortunately, at this human awareness,
you cannot know it, whatever you may try.

01:35.130 --> 01:43.440
If once we humbly understand this, that we
can go up to our mental projections and not

01:43.440 --> 01:54.690
beyond that, Truth has to be known on your
central nervous system. In the evolutionary

01:54.690 --> 02:06.750
process, whatever we have known, we have known
it on our central nervous system. For example,

02:06.750 --> 02:20.450
if you bring a dog or a horse and he sees
this beautiful hall, he won’t understand.

02:20.450 --> 02:29.620
If you take him through a dirty lane, he won’t
understand. He can just pass through. But,

02:29.620 --> 02:42.170
while we human beings have developed a kind
of a sensitivity, sensitivity to so many things.

02:42.170 --> 02:52.390
Also, we should have developed sensitivity
to spirituality, but sometimes we miss the

02:52.390 --> 02:55.950
point.

02:55.950 --> 03:08.830
Now, whatever I am going to tell should be
taken as a hypothesis, but you should have

03:08.830 --> 03:21.120
an open mind of a scientist. If it is true,
you should accept it, if you are honest and,

03:21.120 --> 03:28.310
one must know that it is for the benevolence.
Your benevolence as well as the benevolence

03:28.310 --> 03:41.930
of your country and the benevolence of the
whole world. But, to understand this, I have

03:41.930 --> 03:48.569
to tell you it’s not meant for idiots and
stupid people. You have to have some amount

03:48.569 --> 03:58.510
of I.Q. to understand that we have to achieve
our selfhood, our spirit hood.

03:58.510 --> 04:05.739
What’s the matter with both of you? Why
are you laughing? Will you please go out.

04:05.739 --> 04:18.539
There’s nothing to laugh. Will you please
behave yourself.

04:18.539 --> 04:30.779
So one has to understand that evolutionary
process is absolutely free, without any effort

04:30.779 --> 04:41.509
and you can’t pay for your evolution. It
is spontaneous. Like you have this Mother

04:41.509 --> 04:52.080
Earth and you put the seed in it, then it
sprouts by itself. What do you do? Nothing.

04:52.080 --> 05:01.080
It is spontaneous and that’s what exactly
happens to you, that spontaneously you achieve

05:01.080 --> 05:05.779
that state of the spirit.

05:05.779 --> 05:14.490
When we say, “This is my body. This is my
mind. This is my ego. These are my conditionings,”

05:14.490 --> 05:21.580
we’re all the time saying “my,” but
who is this “I” to whom all these things

05:21.580 --> 05:32.240
belong? We have never questioned this. This
“I” is the spirit.

05:32.240 --> 05:45.120
So the first truth is that you are the pure
spirit. And the second truth is that there

05:45.120 --> 05:56.430
is all pervading power of Divine Love which
does all living work. For example, these beautiful

05:56.430 --> 06:03.669
flowers. We take them for granted. Who runs
our heart? We never ask this question. If

06:03.669 --> 06:10.259
you ask a doctor, he’ll say, “It’s an
autonomous nervous system.” Who is this

06:10.259 --> 06:15.129
auto? If you ask them, they won’t be able
to answer.

06:15.129 --> 06:22.110
So science cannot answer many questions and
one of them is that “Why are we on this

06:22.110 --> 06:31.379
Earth? What is the purpose of our life? What
is the goal of our life? What is our identity?

06:31.379 --> 06:39.219
This question is not asked and, if asked,
they cannot answer. They cannot answer this

06:39.219 --> 06:49.629
simple question, “Why are we on this Earth?”
But one has to know that we are on this Earth

06:49.629 --> 06:56.460
to become the Spirit, to enter into the Kingdom
of God. This is our purpose. That’s why

06:56.460 --> 07:06.430
we are here, and then to be the instruments
of that Divine Power, which is all-pervading.

07:06.430 --> 07:13.059
This Divine Power has been described in many
ways. Patanjali has called has called it as

07:13.059 --> 07:17.029
[check spelling: Ritambarapragya]. In the
Bible it is called as the Cool Breeze of the

07:17.029 --> 07:25.509
Holy Ghost. Also it is called as the All Pervading
Power of Divine Love. In the Koran it is called

07:25.509 --> 07:33.360
as Ruh. In the Indian scriptures it is called
as Paramchaitanya.

07:33.360 --> 07:42.330
The civilization in the West has grown very
big. It’s like a big tree outgrown its size,

07:42.330 --> 07:51.219
but we must find out our roots. I do not make
difference between East and West. So we must

07:51.219 --> 07:57.580
find out our roots, whether it comes from
East or from West. The knowledge today I’m

07:57.580 --> 08:01.649
going to tell you about is the knowledge of
our roots. We [Mother says “we”, but for

08:01.649 --> 08:03.789
clarity sake perhaps should be replaced by
“you”] have been already told about the

08:03.789 --> 08:09.509
centers and about this power that is called
as Kundalini.

08:09.509 --> 08:18.259
This power is placed in the triangular bone
which is called as sacrum, which means Greeks

08:18.259 --> 08:26.189
knew about this centre. They very well knew
about it, that’s why they called it sacred,

08:26.189 --> 08:39.190
sacrum. In many countries there has been a
manifestation that they know about this particular

08:39.190 --> 08:50.490
power. I happened to go to Colombia where
I collected an authentic antique copy of the

08:50.490 --> 09:02.060
antique necklace. The necklace had at its
bottom a Kundalini and even the earrings had

09:02.060 --> 09:16.230
the Kundalini, but, surprisingly, it was from
the Indians of America, found here with the

09:16.230 --> 09:25.910
Indians of America, though it is now kept
in the museum in Colombia. It was in America

09:25.910 --> 09:32.009
that people knew about Kundalini, definitely,
absolutely in three and a half coil they had

09:32.009 --> 09:40.029
done this pattern very well. Is very surprising
that it was done even before Columbus came

09:40.029 --> 09:43.100
here.

09:43.100 --> 09:48.709
So this knowledge was known to people, I think,
all over the world, but then gradually it

09:48.709 --> 10:00.180
subsided. Especially in India, till the twelfth
century, it was kept as a tradition just to

10:00.180 --> 10:07.180
give realization to one person, one guru and
one realization. There was not a sort of a

10:07.180 --> 10:12.850
mass realization, or anything, and they didn’t
even talk about it. They kept a secret. But

10:12.850 --> 10:22.120
in the twelfth century one great poet called
Ganyeshwara, he wrote in his book, “Ganyeshwari,”

10:22.120 --> 10:28.870
sixth chapter about Kundalini. He took the
permission of his guru and he wrote it, but

10:28.870 --> 10:35.670
still they denounced it and they said that
this is something not to be read because they

10:35.670 --> 10:39.690
didn’t know how to do it. They didn’t
know how to raise the Kundalini. They didn’t

10:39.690 --> 10:44.699
know how to give realization. So the people
who were at the helm of affairs said, they

10:44.699 --> 10:49.759
denounced it, “Don’t read this chapter.”

10:49.759 --> 10:56.990
Then in the sixteenth century we had many
poets in India who have written about it,

10:56.990 --> 11:07.149
Guru Nanaka, Kabira, Ramadasa, so many of
them have written about this Kundalini awakening.

11:07.149 --> 11:13.740
Many then tantricas came up who’d write
to misuse the word and misused the whole thing

11:13.740 --> 11:18.079
and deceived people by telling them false
things.

11:18.079 --> 11:22.250
There are so many false people who came to
your country and I feel ashamed about them,

11:22.250 --> 11:27.769
those who came in this country, but also you
people are to be blamed in a way, because

11:27.769 --> 11:36.589
you should have used some discretion. When
I came first, you’ll be surprised in ’72,

11:36.589 --> 11:44.879
they asked Me funny questions. In Boston,
I was there for an interview with the television

11:44.879 --> 11:51.600
and they asked Me, not on the television,
but before that, how many Rolls Royces you

11:51.600 --> 11:56.600
have?” I said, “I’ve no Rolls Royce.”
So they said, “Are you not in the business?”

11:56.600 --> 12:02.459
I said, “This is no business. This is something
else.” So they said, “We don’t believe

12:02.459 --> 12:07.389
in a person who has no business and we’ll
not give you any chance on the television.”

12:07.389 --> 12:13.819
People were so materialistic and they said,
“You are not taking any money, so it must

12:13.819 --> 12:19.870
be something hocus pocus.” So superficial
they were. I was very disappointed and I said,

12:19.870 --> 12:24.670
“I’ll never come to this country” and
I didn’t come for nine years, till some

12:24.670 --> 12:31.240
people who were here who got interests and
they told Me, “Mother, better come now.

12:31.240 --> 12:38.810
Is going to be better than what you found
it in 1972.” So I came here.

12:38.810 --> 12:44.699
So one has to understand that it’s a living
process and you cannot pay for it. There’s

12:44.699 --> 12:52.100
no guarantee. There’s no guarantee, but
if you desire all of you can get your realization

12:52.100 --> 12:58.930
without any difficulty. It’s a very simple
thing that happens to you. When this Kundalini

12:58.930 --> 13:08.759
passes through these six centers, it nourishes
it, it integrates it. Also it enlightens them.

13:08.759 --> 13:15.939
By that, our physical, mental, and emotional,
spiritual problems are solved. Most of the

13:15.939 --> 13:22.470
global problems are because of human beings,
and most of the human problems are because

13:22.470 --> 13:28.360
of these chakras or these centers within us.

13:28.360 --> 13:36.310
So, if you can cure these centers, you can
definitely cure human beings physically, mentally,

13:36.310 --> 13:45.110
emotionally and also spiritually. But then
it is connected. The yoga takes place with

13:45.110 --> 13:53.180
this all pervading power and the light of
the spirit shines in your attention. Then

13:53.180 --> 13:58.730
so many things happen that you are amazed
how fantastic you are. These are all your

13:58.730 --> 14:04.009
dormant powers, will start manifesting.

14:04.009 --> 14:12.069
One thing one should know that there cannot
be any gimmick about Truth. There cannot be

14:12.069 --> 14:21.569
any sort of a false pretenses about it. It
has to be straight forward and simple, but

14:21.569 --> 14:30.680
I have known people who have been doing all
kinds of things, like people paid three hundred

14:30.680 --> 14:37.249
pounds for a mantra. I mean, this, in India,
nobody would do, but thank God we are not

14:37.249 --> 14:41.490
so rich to waste our money. Three hundred
pounds for a mantra, you don’t need any

14:41.490 --> 14:53.480
guru for that, a donkey can do it also. And
then, after that, somebody says you can raise

14:53.480 --> 15:02.420
yourself from the grounds and about three
feet you can fly. Already there’s jam on

15:02.420 --> 15:05.860
the roads. Why do you want to have such people
flying at three feet? They’ll be hitting

15:05.860 --> 15:12.649
all the cars, I think. But people paid six
thousand pounds for such a nonsense. They

15:12.649 --> 15:20.329
broke their bottoms and had all kinds of problems
and they have been to Me with epilepsy. So

15:20.329 --> 15:25.360
all such stupid things people have done without
even thinking.

15:25.360 --> 15:30.339
Now there’s a new thing they have started,
showing a pendulum can move with your mind

15:30.339 --> 15:38.339
power. It’s nothing but mesmerism, simple.
But we have to know [what is] what is our

15:38.339 --> 15:45.620
value. What are we here for? What, are we
here just to move pendulums or to fly in the

15:45.620 --> 15:52.360
air? Why are we here? That’s why at the
very outset I said that Sahaja Yoga is not

15:52.360 --> 16:01.870
meant for idiotic or stupid people. It’s
a complete logical thing which is tangible.

16:01.870 --> 16:07.720
You can find out. For example, I said that
physically you are cured.

16:07.720 --> 16:16.839
Yes, of course, there are three doctors, one
of them is here, who got his M.D. in Sahaja

16:16.839 --> 16:25.499
Yoga, which showed you can cure incurable
diseases like asthma, epilepsy and also physical

16:25.499 --> 16:33.670
fitness. Three doctors got this. And there
are many doctors who are doing this research

16:33.670 --> 16:43.879
all over the world. You’ll be surprised
that in Russia there are two thousand doctors

16:43.879 --> 16:54.689
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga. I must say,
for your information, Russians are tremendously

16:54.689 --> 17:04.280
sensitive to spirituality. They threw out
all false gurus, everything. I don’t know,

17:04.280 --> 17:11.600
maybe our freedom has lead us into a mess
like this. Freedom without discretion can

17:11.600 --> 17:19.839
be very dangerous. That may be the reason
we are now finding lost, as far as our society

17:19.839 --> 17:26.190
is concerned, as far as our children are concerned.
In every way, we are confused.

17:26.190 --> 17:35.050
But there’s a way out from all this which
is very simple and the way out is that your

17:35.050 --> 17:44.490
Kundalini is to be awakened. That’s very
simple, I told you, because it is built in.

17:44.490 --> 17:54.640
It’s your own power that is going to work
it out. No obligation. There’s no commitment,

17:54.640 --> 18:02.590
nothing. As far as you are a human being,
that is sufficient because you are at the

18:02.590 --> 18:10.850
epitome of evolution. We do not know our value.
We don’t even think why God made us human

18:10.850 --> 18:17.270
beings. We just accept ourselves as human
beings, but there are so many problems and

18:17.270 --> 18:22.490
so many confusions that we don’t understand
what’s going on.

18:22.490 --> 18:29.240
One of the reasons is that we do not know
the absolute Truth. Somebody says this is

18:29.240 --> 18:33.630
right, another says that is right. Somebody
says this is right and they’re fighting.

18:33.630 --> 18:40.920
They believe in it. They believe that this
is right, that is right and they fight. All

18:40.920 --> 18:53.500
kinds of wrong ideas have been managed to
exploit us, to befool us and to lead us into

18:53.500 --> 19:01.370
the path of destruction. We are getting destroyed
from within, if you see. All kinds of diseases,

19:01.370 --> 19:10.410
unknown diseases are coming up. Our children
are getting ruined. Families are getting ruined.

19:10.410 --> 19:15.650
What is the reason for this decline? Within
these thirty, forty years only such a decline

19:15.650 --> 19:24.860
has come. What is the reason? The reason is,
one of them is that our indiscrete freedom.

19:24.860 --> 19:26.820
And a second one, I think, is materialism.

19:26.820 --> 19:32.550
As I told you, they asked Me for a Rolls Royce
because they can’t understand anything without

19:32.550 --> 19:41.620
money. This is the most absurd thing that
they believe that spirituality also can be

19:41.620 --> 19:50.390
bought with money. You can purchase your guru.
You can retain him. You cannot.

19:50.390 --> 20:01.630
So what happens to you when you get your realization
is first you feel a Cool Breeze on your fingertips.

20:01.630 --> 20:09.680
Also you feel a Cool Breeze coming out of
your fontanelle bone area, which is the actualization

20:09.680 --> 20:17.550
of your baptism. It’s actualization. And
Sahaja Yoga is becoming, it is not just a

20:17.550 --> 20:26.610
lecture or explanation or a sermon. It is
becoming. Means you become something that

20:26.610 --> 20:34.660
is already described that you are to be born
again. Now, if you just certify yourself as

20:34.660 --> 20:41.250
born again, you are not. It’s just a false
certificate. If you are born again, you have

20:41.250 --> 20:50.450
certain powers and you become a saint. You
have to be a saint if you are born again.

20:50.450 --> 20:56.390
You become a Sufi, but if that doesn’t happen
to you, you cannot just certify yourself as

20:56.390 --> 21:04.270
born again. Any certificate are like this.
It’s just a brand. For example, it might

21:04.270 --> 21:14.890
be a Hindu, Muslim, Christian; any one can
commit any sin. It’s just a brand. It’s

21:14.890 --> 21:16.940
nothing inside.

21:16.940 --> 21:24.190
So what happens to you that you become a righteous
person, you become you can’t do wrong things.

21:24.190 --> 21:31.880
You cannot do things which are irreligious.
You just don’t do it. You don’t get tempted

21:31.880 --> 21:39.250
to do anything. On the contrary, you enjoy
your virtues. Your attention becomes absolutely

21:39.250 --> 21:47.190
innocent, without any lust and greed. And
such a person, even a glance of such a person

21:47.190 --> 21:48.170
can bring peace.

21:48.170 --> 21:58.170
The source of all this is this All Pervading
Power of Divine Love. So you are connected

21:58.170 --> 22:03.970
with that power. Once you are connected with
that power, it starts flowing through and

22:03.970 --> 22:15.950
when it starts flowing through you, you can
feel it. Then it makes you grow. As a result,

22:15.950 --> 22:23.060
you know the Absolute Truth on your fingertips.
Even children can know the Absolute Truth

22:23.060 --> 22:29.060
on their fingertips. There are people who
don’t believe in God. They come to Me. I

22:29.060 --> 22:33.830
say, “All right, ask the question, ‘Is
there God?’ three times” and they get

22:33.830 --> 22:39.790
the Cool Breeze. Then I’ll [say] “Just
say, ‘There is God.'” Then they get a

22:39.790 --> 22:48.250
tremendous stream of Cool Breeze. Thus, you
can make out also your own centers, what’s

22:48.250 --> 22:53.650
wrong with your own centers. Is there any
problem in your centre? Immediately you can

22:53.650 --> 22:57.980
find out on the fingertips.

22:57.980 --> 23:09.410
Many people who are about to go for a heart
attack or for some sort of a serious cancer,

23:09.410 --> 23:14.440
do not know they have. But a Sahaja Yogi will
immediately know that on his centre is catching

23:14.440 --> 23:22.500
and immediately he knows also how to correct
it. So you can have self-knowledge about your

23:22.500 --> 23:24.910
own centers and you understand.

23:24.910 --> 23:31.070
Today only, one gentleman came and told Me,
“Mother, my Agnya is catching. Means that

23:31.070 --> 23:36.490
I’m egotistical.” Nobody would say that,
“I’m egoistical,” but he just came and

23:36.490 --> 23:41.270
told Me, “Mother, my Agyna’s catching.
Please correct me.” That means yourself

23:41.270 --> 23:46.580
knows that this is happening within yourself
and you know how to correct yourself, so you

23:46.580 --> 23:54.310
become the doctor, you become diagnosis and
you become the medicine. It sounds very fantastic,

23:54.310 --> 23:56.480
but it’s a fact.

23:56.480 --> 24:00.960
Then the second thing happens to you that
you get the knowledge about other’s centers

24:00.960 --> 24:07.150
also. You know about others. Sitting down
here you can find out what are the centers

24:07.150 --> 24:13.980
of any person. Immediately you can find out.
Once you find out the centers, if you know

24:13.980 --> 24:19.470
how to correct them, you can correct also
others. So who is the other? The microcosm

24:19.470 --> 24:23.280
becomes the macrocosm.

24:23.280 --> 24:31.560
Then we have another problem always that we
live in the future or in the past, never in

24:31.560 --> 24:36.470
the present. If I say come to your present,
you cannot come. It’s very difficult for

24:36.470 --> 24:43.230
you to come to your present. So what’s the
reason is that we are thinking of the future

24:43.230 --> 24:49.510
and the past. One thought rises and falls
down. Another thought rises and falls down.

24:49.510 --> 24:57.740
In between these thoughts there is this vilumba
[check spelling], is what we call the present.

24:57.740 --> 25:06.470
When the Kundalini rises, she elongates the
thoughts and this space increases and you

25:06.470 --> 25:14.520
become thoughtlessly aware, thoughtlessly
aware. You become, again I say you become.

25:14.520 --> 25:19.870
There are no thoughts, but you are absolutely
aware which is also described by Jung that

25:19.870 --> 25:26.900
after realization you become thoughtlessly
aware.

25:26.900 --> 25:33.170
That is the time you are absolutely at peace
with yourself and with everything else. That’s

25:33.170 --> 25:40.320
the time you are peaceful in the real sense
of the word. I’ve seen people getting many

25:40.320 --> 25:48.720
awards, peace awards, of peace conferences
and all that. I know them, but, surprisingly,

25:48.720 --> 25:53.300
they’re extremely hot tempered and if you
have to talk to them, also you have to take

25:53.300 --> 25:57.130
a barge pole in between because they have
such a temper. I don’t know how they got

25:57.130 --> 26:02.990
these peace awards and things like that, but
you find them all around, such people who

26:02.990 --> 26:05.850
have got peace award without any peace within.

26:05.850 --> 26:12.570
So you have to have your peace within yourself
and this you achieve through thoughtless awareness.

26:12.570 --> 26:18.890
Then another thing happens to you that you
become the witness, the witness of the whole

26:18.890 --> 26:27.250
drama. Say, if you are in the water and there
are waves, you’re afraid of it. But supposing

26:27.250 --> 26:38.130
you get into the boat, then you watch these
very carefully you can watch them. Also, you

26:38.130 --> 26:46.100
can enjoy them. But supposing you know how
to swim, then you can jump and save many people.

26:46.100 --> 26:52.860
So like this, into two stages, you rise. The
first one, when you rise into the boat when

26:52.860 --> 26:58.990
you are thoughtlessly aware and the second
stage, which we call is a doubtless awareness,

26:58.990 --> 27:08.390
which is called as Sanskrit language it is
called as Nirvikalpa samadhi the first one

27:08.390 --> 27:14.670
as Nirvichar samadhi and the second one as
Nirvikalpa samadhi where you have no doubts

27:14.670 --> 27:22.380
about yourself. You know that. You know all
your inner knowledge. You know about your

27:22.380 --> 27:26.770
inner being and you know about the inner beings
of others.

27:26.770 --> 27:33.760
This knowledge we have to know and it takes
hardly any time for you to know, hardly I

27:33.760 --> 27:44.510
would say, even one month is sufficient. But
what I’ve seen that people have to be deep

27:44.510 --> 27:51.150
to go into it. Normally, once they get realization,
they feel extremely relaxed, peaceful, then

27:51.150 --> 27:59.940
finished. But it’s like a seed being sprouted.
It has to grow into a tree. They get lost

27:59.940 --> 28:04.090
first some disease they have is cured, then
they come out with another disease second

28:04.090 --> 28:11.990
year I come back. So one has to be determined
about it in the beginning. Then you cannot

28:11.990 --> 28:17.520
leave it because you enjoy it so much. You
know that you are now in the Kingdom of God.

28:17.520 --> 28:38.710
When I was in Russia there was this coupe
going on. I asked the Russians, I said, “Aren’t

28:38.710 --> 28:55.840
you… [Interruption in recording]

28:55.840 --> 29:07.820
The another thing that happens to you, that
you jump into the Ocean of Joy. So far we

29:07.820 --> 29:14.730
have never known Joy. We have happiness and
unhappiness. Whatever pampers our ego, we’ll

29:14.730 --> 29:20.260
feel happy or which gives us some emotional
satisfaction, we’ll feel happy and then

29:20.260 --> 29:30.630
we feel unhappy. So we jump from one to another.
But with this, we are in the Ocean of Joy.

29:30.630 --> 29:33.340
Now we’ll [should be changed to “you’ll]
be surprised that Sahaja Yoga is working in

29:33.340 --> 29:39.970
fifty-five nations. I’m sorry, to Philadelphia
I have come for the first time. I wanted to

29:39.970 --> 29:47.010
come, but I was so disappointed when I came
here in ’72. We are only four people for

29:47.010 --> 29:52.470
the program. Such a big hall and four people
sitting there, so I said, “Better not go

29:52.470 --> 29:58.480
to Philadelphia. May be the same style.”
And these out of these four people, the other

29:58.480 --> 30:03.830
day one gentleman came and told Me that, “You
cure my father’s eyesight in 1972.” I

30:03.830 --> 30:09.020
said, “Maybe, I don’t remember all that,”
but he was one of them who came.

30:09.020 --> 30:16.270
So you can imagine how now the awareness for
spirituality is growing. You see so many people

30:16.270 --> 30:24.220
now. So many people that I’m amazed Myself
this year what has happened suddenly that

30:24.220 --> 30:30.660
where only we were getting only four or seven
people, suddenly we have so many people. While

30:30.660 --> 30:38.520
they use to go to all kinds of false gurus,
pay them money and get injured or get into

30:38.520 --> 30:43.970
recluseness or all kinds of things would happen
to them. But this time I was surprised, all

30:43.970 --> 30:51.280
over America there’s a kind of an awakening
and people are becoming more alert about it.

30:51.280 --> 30:57.200
All these things happen to you for which you
don’t have to pay. For all the knowledge,

30:57.200 --> 31:05.610
you don’t have to pay. You have just attend
our collectivity, means we have our centers,

31:05.610 --> 31:12.600
so please come to our centers and where they
will give you all the knowledge about it.

31:12.600 --> 31:18.490
You can master it, maximum, within one month’s
time. You just become masters.

31:18.490 --> 31:23.340
Now you may say, “Mother, it is very fantastic
to hear about ourselves, but you don’t know

31:23.340 --> 31:32.320
how fantastic you are. Like you take a small
little box of a television to some remote

31:32.320 --> 31:39.390
village. All the people will say, “What
is this? It is just a box?” Why, you tell

31:39.390 --> 31:46.310
them that there is going to be you can easily
see lots of films in it. They won’t believe.

31:46.310 --> 31:55.320
Once it is connected only that they’ll be
amazed at the television, the way it is showing

31:55.320 --> 32:02.450
all kinds of things because it is built-in
and also it is built-in in you. All this is

32:02.450 --> 32:13.190
there which is within you, which you can easily
verify it. It’s absolutely tangible and

32:13.190 --> 32:19.750
then you know the value of your life and then
you know the purpose of your life.

32:19.750 --> 32:24.710
This is what it is. In this short time, I
don’t know how much I can tell you about

32:24.710 --> 32:33.360
it. Now, you have here beautiful lights and
beautifully they’re lit up. You have to

32:33.360 --> 32:43.180
use only one switch. It all comes up. If I
have to tell you the history of electricity,

32:43.180 --> 32:50.120
how it came to this country, then to your
city and all that, it would be very boring.

32:50.120 --> 32:53.400
But if it is built-in, why not have the light?

32:53.400 --> 33:00.660
So, I would say that you should have the light
and you should know what you are. First you

33:00.660 --> 33:06.430
get that light and then we will see about
the rest of the knowledge. That you can easily

33:06.430 --> 33:11.980
get when you go to our centers and they will
give you. I have to confess that we don’t

33:11.980 --> 33:18.400
take any money, so we do not have elaborate
places like Taj Mahal to have our programs.

33:18.400 --> 33:25.280
It’s simple abodes and in simple places
you have to come with a simple mind to achieve

33:25.280 --> 33:26.860
your spiritual life.

33:26.860 --> 33:38.990
That’s what it is today. I do not know that
what it is to, that we are now in the blossom

33:38.990 --> 33:46.690
time, as I call it, because many flowers are
born and they are to become the fruits. This

33:46.690 --> 33:52.760
is the resurrection time, which is described
in all the scriptures. But it’s not like

33:52.760 --> 33:58.560
this, the way they had described us, something
wrong with them, that all the dead bodies

33:58.560 --> 34:04.520
who are in the graves will come out of the
graves. I mean, how much is left out of them,

34:04.520 --> 34:10.730
God knows. Must be some bones or maybe some
skulls there. So they’ll come out of the

34:10.730 --> 34:16.260
graves and they will get their resurrection.
This is a very wrong idea.

34:16.260 --> 34:22.129
Once I happened to meet a fellow, a Muslim
from Bosnia and he told Me “I want to die

34:22.129 --> 34:29.540
for my religion, for God’s sake.” I said,
“But why? Who told you to die?” He said,

34:29.540 --> 34:34.450
“Now, if I die in the name of God, I’ll
be resurrected.” I said, “It’s all wrong.

34:34.450 --> 34:39.159
That’s not the way it is going to work out.
Resurrection is going to work out this way.

34:39.159 --> 34:45.310
That at this time, all these souls will take
their birth. All these souls will take their

34:45.310 --> 34:50.810
birth and they will be resurrected as human
beings they’ll have to come.” That’s

34:50.810 --> 35:00.850
why we find all kinds of funny people these
days, all kinds of cruel, criminal, all kinds

35:00.850 --> 35:10.910
of idiotic, stupid, I mean very queer, weird
funny ideas which find such, such a variety

35:10.910 --> 35:20.970
of people and such a tremendous population
that we should understand they have to have

35:20.970 --> 35:26.830
their chance of resurrection. But how many
will come? That’s the point. How many are

35:26.830 --> 35:28.070
going to come?

35:28.070 --> 35:34.040
Now, see, in your Philadelphia there are so
many people. How many are here and how many

35:34.040 --> 35:38.760
are going to get realization and how many
are going to settle down? Depends on their

35:38.760 --> 35:44.580
wisdom and depends on their understanding
of spirituality. If they don’t have, you

35:44.580 --> 35:51.690
cannot force on them. You cannot force Self
Realization on them. Never. It has to be accepted.

35:51.690 --> 35:58.830
In their own freedom, they have to ask for
it. It cannot be forced. This power that you

35:58.830 --> 36:06.980
see is a power of pure desire. If you don’t
have pure desire, it won’t rise, all other

36:06.980 --> 36:14.830
desires are such that they’re never satiable
in general, so this desire that you have within.

36:14.830 --> 36:20.080
You may be aware of it or you may not be,
but it is there and once it is awakened, such

36:20.080 --> 36:26.780
a satisfaction settles in you. You are very
satisfied with yourself and life becomes so

36:26.780 --> 36:34.280
beautiful. And the friendship [and the] because
I heard this is a brotherly and a sisterly

36:34.280 --> 36:40.780
place. I was very happy to hear that. That
is what exactly Sahaja Yoga is, such love.

36:40.780 --> 36:45.760
Now I told you there are fifty five nations
which are following Sahaja Yoga, but when

36:45.760 --> 36:51.580
you see one Sahaja Yogis meeting another one,
I mean, you really feel, “What is this?

36:51.580 --> 36:58.240
How it is happening? How they are achieving
it?” It’s not easy to understand such

36:58.240 --> 37:05.850
love, such pure love. We never had any case
of flirting or any case of any woman running

37:05.850 --> 37:10.920
away with some another husband or something.
It’s never seen that. They’re so innocent

37:10.920 --> 37:17.310
and so simple. Just like children they become
and the way they behave towards each other

37:17.310 --> 37:23.820
is beautiful to see. This is a new race of
angels. My husband always said that, “I

37:23.820 --> 37:28.630
know You are an angel. You are something great.
But I don’t think you can make others.”

37:28.630 --> 37:33.560
He was sure about it. Now he says that “I
have to believe” and I have to say, yes,

37:33.560 --> 37:38.630
it is so because if you have to be honest,
you see those things. You all can become [unclear:

37:38.630 --> 37:44.380
that]. Just have self-confidence about it,
that you all can become that, all these powers

37:44.380 --> 37:49.770
are within you and that nobody can take away
these powers from you.

37:49.770 --> 37:57.350
Now, I don’t know, I find people who like
to ask Me questions. I don’t mind answering

37:57.350 --> 38:02.310
any number of questions, but I must tell you
for the last twenty-three years I have been

38:02.310 --> 38:10.600
doing this job. I know how to answer all questions.
I am quite an expert. But it’s a mental

38:10.600 --> 38:16.630
acrobat. What’s the use? It’s a mental
acrobat. If you ask Me questions, I’ll answer,

38:16.630 --> 38:23.200
no doubt. I’m quite good at it. But the
best thing is first to get the light. After

38:23.200 --> 38:31.530
getting the light, then you see for yourself
and understand that it is all there. But if

38:31.530 --> 38:37.450
you want, should we ask them to ask questions?
It’s better. About fifteen minutes are still

38:37.450 --> 38:38.070
there.

38:38.070 --> 38:40.560
Shri Mataji: Yes, please.

38:40.560 --> 38:44.300
[Man asks: “Did you advocate meditation?”]

38:44.300 --> 38:53.270
Shri Mataji: No, please be seated. It’s
very good question. You see, meditation cannot

38:53.270 --> 39:01.110
be done. You are in meditation. When you are
thoughtlessly aware, you are in meditation,

39:01.110 --> 39:05.830
otherwise we say we are doing meditation.
You can’t do it. You have to go beyond the

39:05.830 --> 39:12.100
mind, then you are in a meditative condition.
So, there is meditation, but where you have

39:12.100 --> 39:15.760
to become thoughtlessly aware.

39:15.760 --> 39:32.340
[A man asks a question.] [A yogi speaks to
Shri Mataji in Hindi.]

39:32.340 --> 39:33.880
Shri Mataji: Oh, very good. What a nice question.
That’s a seeker. That’s a seeker.

39:33.880 --> 39:34.080
Yes, Sir.

39:34.080 --> 39:46.070
[A man asks a question and a yogi explains;
“He’s talking about the channel of desire.

39:46.070 --> 39:50.950
Channel of desire. Go ahead.”]

39:50.950 --> 39:57.040
[The man continues his questions.]

39:57.040 --> 40:05.250
[Yogi: “He wants to know about the different
types of desires, the desires that relate

40:05.250 --> 40:05.750
-“]
Shri Mataji: The different types of

40:05.750 --> 40:10.970
[Yogi continues: “- the worldly desires
and the spiritual desires, how would you differentiate?”]

40:10.970 --> 40:16.450
{The man continues to speak.]

40:16.450 --> 40:17.880
[Yogi: “He’s mixed up.”]

40:17.880 --> 40:19.320
Shri Mataji: All right.

40:19.320 --> 40:21.860
[The same man asks, “And how is this related
to bhakti?”]

40:21.860 --> 40:22.630
[Yogi: “He’s asking about the relationship
of desires to bhakti.”]

40:22.630 --> 40:22.790
Desires to -?

40:22.790 --> 40:22.940
[Yogi: “Bhakti.”]

40:22.940 --> 40:23.490
Shri Mataji: All right. Please be seated.

40:23.490 --> 40:28.590
Shri Mataji: So I’ll answer your first question,
the second question first bhakti. We are doing

40:28.590 --> 40:35.700
bhakti now, of God. Without connection, what
is the bhakti? It’s like a telephone. Without

40:35.700 --> 40:40.310
connection, you’re telephoning to God, He
doesn’t listen to you. Many people come

40:40.310 --> 40:44.760
to Me. They say, “Mother, I have done so
much bhakti of Shri Krishna, but my throat

40:44.760 --> 40:50.150
is bad and I’ve got cancer of the throat.
If you say Shri Krishna looks after the throat,

40:50.150 --> 40:56.630
why is it?” Because you’re not yet connected.
If you’re not connected, what’s the use

40:56.630 --> 40:59.860
of doing bhakti. Simple thing, extremely simple.

40:59.860 --> 41:01.910
Shri Mataji: What was the first question?

41:01.910 --> 41:05.920
[Yogi: “The different types of desires,
the worldly desires and the spiritual desires.”]

41:05.920 --> 41:10.230
Shri Mataji: All right. Now people are saying
that you must give up this, you must give

41:10.230 --> 41:15.480
up that. There’s nothing to be given up.
If you give up, still you’ll stick on to

41:15.480 --> 41:21.420
that. I’ve known people who are very much
stuck, but they think they have given up.

41:21.420 --> 41:27.680
Like, I’ll tell you, some people came to
see Me. They wanted to use our ships for some

41:27.680 --> 41:36.180
purpose and they said that “We have”,
they came in an ascetic dress and they said,

41:36.180 --> 41:41.450
“Mother, you are suppose to be a holy person,
but you are sitting in all luxury and all

41:41.450 --> 41:48.160
this. How are you a holy person? We have given
up our houses. We have given up our cars,

41:48.160 --> 41:56.700
given up this, given up that.” I said, “All
right, in this house or anything which is

41:56.700 --> 42:08.100
with Me is equal to the dust particle of God
Almighty, of His Feet. You can pick up anything,

42:08.100 --> 42:18.600
but should be equal.” They started looking
around. They have not given up anything. They

42:18.600 --> 42:25.540
have given up stones. A detachment develops
within yourself.

42:25.540 --> 42:31.390
I don’t know if you have heard the story
of Raja Janaka, whose guru was Ashtabhakar

42:31.390 --> 42:41.770
[check spelling]. Raja Janaka was the father-in-law
of Shri Ram. This Raja Janaka was a king and

42:41.770 --> 42:47.950
all the saints use to bow to him, so one fellow
asked his guru, “Why is it you bow to this

42:47.950 --> 42:55.500
king? He is a king and what is so great?”
He said, “He’s the only one who can give

42:55.500 --> 42:58.360
realization and he’s so high.”

42:58.360 --> 43:05.440
So he sent one of his disciples, his name
was Nachikita [check spelling] to Raja Janaka.

43:05.440 --> 43:10.720
Raja Janaka told him, “No, you can ask anything,
but I’ll not give you self realization.”

43:10.720 --> 43:16.350
He said, “No, Sir, I must have it. But I
want to know about myself.” So he said,

43:16.350 --> 43:22.950
“All right.” So first he took him with
himself to have a bath in the river. I mean

43:22.950 --> 43:30.340
many tests he took, but lastly. And there
he was having his bath while people came and

43:30.340 --> 43:36.770
told that “Sir”, he was meditating. He
was in thoughtless awareness, just enjoying

43:36.770 --> 43:46.230
himself. And they came and told that “Your
palace is on fire.” Still he was meditating.

43:46.230 --> 43:52.340
Then they came and told him that “Now all
the family is running away from the palace.”

43:52.340 --> 43:58.180
Still he was meditating. Then they said, “The
fire is coming here and will burn everything

43:58.180 --> 44:06.380
that you have.” Now this fellow ran out
and he clutched his clothes because he thought,

44:06.380 --> 44:14.880
“This will be all burned.” But he was
still meditating. And then when he opened

44:14.880 --> 44:22.630
his eyes, he saw nothing has happened. “I
know nothing has happened. And it’s nothing

44:22.630 --> 44:24.910
important to me.”

44:24.910 --> 44:32.860
So the detachment is within. It’s not without.
You don’t have to announce it. It is within.

44:32.860 --> 44:44.070
It’s something that you do everything. As
I knew, I am a grandmother, I’m a mother,

44:44.070 --> 44:50.660
I’m a wife. My husband was holding a very
big position, all that. I did everything,

44:50.660 --> 44:58.460
but there’s a kind of a detachment about
it and this detachment can only be possible

44:58.460 --> 45:08.110
if you develop your spiritual powers. When
your spirit shines, you see everything is

45:08.110 --> 45:16.520
useless and fruitless, but by giving up things,
by renouncing things, you’re just pampering

45:16.520 --> 45:20.520
your ego by saying, “I have given up this.
I have given up that.”

45:20.520 --> 45:29.960
The other day I met a Buddhist who was a seeker.
He was all shaved off. His hair was shaved

45:29.960 --> 45:36.690
off. And he said, “Mother, I am not only
shaved off, but I am now a bankrupt.” I

45:36.690 --> 45:43.670
said, “Why?” “Because I was giving all
my money, everything to this Buddhist organization

45:43.670 --> 45:50.820
and now I’m bankrupt and I don’t know
what to do with myself.” I said “how can

45:50.820 --> 46:00.970
you pay”? God doesn’t understand money.
No.” He doesn’t understand banking. It’s

46:00.970 --> 46:05.880
your headache. You have made money. You have
made banks. You have made these houses. What

46:05.880 --> 46:12.500
is there if you give up or don’t give up?
What difference does it make? It’s your

46:12.500 --> 46:15.580
doing. All right?

46:15.580 --> 46:23.670
So the detachment must come from within and
that is so automatic. It’s a state which

46:23.670 --> 46:25.960
we have to achieve in our evolution.

46:25.960 --> 46:52.720
[Shri Mataji speaks to a Yogi in Hindi. Another
question is asked by a man in the audience.

46:52.720 --> 47:35.000
It concerns his wife and a mantra she was
given by a false guru. The wife also gets

47:35.000 --> 47:45.640
burning sensations on her fingertips…The
question is translated to Shri Mataji.]

47:45.640 --> 47:49.010
Shri Mataji: If she’s saying mantras, she
should not say. You see, mantras, please be

47:49.010 --> 47:56.030
seated, I’ll tell you. Mantras are, there’s
a science about it. You must know what centre

47:56.030 --> 48:01.510
is out of gear, which mantra to be said for
which center. It is not at random like you

48:01.510 --> 48:05.690
take out the whole Pandora box and start taking
all the medicines. No. You must know everything

48:05.690 --> 48:12.490
and if her fingers are burning it’s not
a very good sign and I wish she would had

48:12.490 --> 48:28.450
come here, I would have seen to her. But where
is the [Interruption in recording]

48:28.450 --> 48:38.280
Shri Mataji: Is it on the left hand or right
hand? [The man answers.]

48:38.280 --> 48:44.280
[Yogi: “…she’s asking was the burning
on the left hand or the right hand?]

48:44.280 --> 48:47.520
[Man: “I don’t know. I cannot -“]

48:47.520 --> 48:52.630
[Yogi: “He doesn’t know” and speaks
in Hindi.]

48:52.630 --> 49:04.680
Shri Mataji: You see, I don’t want to say
anything, but something wrong with the guru

49:04.680 --> 49:09.070
himself, I think. I’m sorry.

49:09.070 --> 49:13.460
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

49:13.460 --> 49:16.090
Shri Mataji: Yes?

49:16.090 --> 49:20.480
[A woman asks a question.]

49:20.480 --> 49:24.869
[Shri Mataji speaks in Hindi.]

49:24.869 --> 49:31.890
[Yogi: “…She’s praying for his enlightenment
and vision….”]

49:31.890 --> 49:42.070
Shri Mataji: All right, very good idea, but
I have so many children here. Alright? Good.

49:42.070 --> 49:59.040
[Man: “Would you further explain this thoughtless
awareness and is it the same as mindful awareness

49:59.040 --> 49:59.640
of the Buddhist philosophy?]

49:59.640 --> 50:01.430
[Yogi: “The difference between thoughtless
awareness and mindful awareness.”]

50:01.430 --> 50:06.810
Shri Mataji: It’s the same, but you see,
Buddhism is very confused as every religion

50:06.810 --> 50:14.200
has been, very much confused and so I do not
know what they are thinking about it, but

50:14.200 --> 50:18.859
it’s the same thing. Is the same thing as
thoughtless awareness, should be the same

50:18.859 --> 50:29.030
thing and also many things Buddha has said
have been misused and have been, I should

50:29.030 --> 50:35.220
say, quite twisted also. So to understand
Buddhism, you take to Sahaja Yoga first. Once

50:35.220 --> 50:40.400
you get your realizations, Sir, you’ll understand
Buddhism much better in the sense that it

50:40.400 --> 50:45.700
should not be Buddhism, but it is Buddha’s
Bodha. “Bodha” means to know on your central

50:45.700 --> 50:50.980
nervous system. You become a Buddha, yourself.
You become, yourself, an enlightened person.

50:50.980 --> 50:51.250
Alright?

50:51.250 --> 50:52.090
Now, what’s it?

50:52.090 --> 51:03.350
[A man asks, “Could you please say what
the dangers are associated with Kundalini

51:03.350 --> 51:03.590
meditation.”]

51:03.590 --> 51:05.730
[Yogi: “He’s asking about any dangers
of Kundalini meditation.”]

51:05.730 --> 51:09.770
Shri Mataji: No, no, No, no. Not at all, not
at all; She’s your mother. She’s your

51:09.770 --> 51:15.040
individual mother, who gives you your second
birth. She knows everything about you. She

51:15.040 --> 51:22.210
has recorded everything and she does it very
gently. See, when you were born, your mother

51:22.210 --> 51:30.230
took all the pains upon herself, isn’t it?
And in the same way, this Kundalini does the

51:30.230 --> 51:35.490
job. But people are frightened because perhaps
maybe they don’t want, it’s an evil force

51:35.490 --> 51:39.450
I think, those who are frightened against
Kundalini because they don’t know how to

51:39.450 --> 51:49.540
do it or maybe they don’t want people to
achieve their realization. I can’t understand.

51:49.540 --> 51:56.930
Those people, as I was telling you today,
in the sixteen century Guru Nanaka, then Kabira

51:56.930 --> 52:02.930
and all these others, Ramadasa, Tukarama,
all of them, nobody has said it’s dangerous.

52:02.930 --> 52:09.450
On the contrary, Ramadasa was asked, “How
much time does it take for Kundalini to rise?”

52:09.450 --> 52:14.820
He used the word in Sanskrit, “Takshana,
that’s the moment, that moment,” he said.

52:14.820 --> 52:22.820
“Takshana, that moment.” So, But,” he
said, “there’s a condition. The one who

52:22.820 --> 52:33.490
wants should be anxious to have it and the
one who gives should be an authority, not

52:33.490 --> 52:41.310
an authority from some university or anything,
but authority in spirituality.”

52:41.310 --> 52:42.270
Yes.

52:42.270 --> 52:58.510
[A man asks a question concerning the position
a person must be in order to get Kundalini

52:58.510 --> 52:59.460
awakening.]

52:59.460 --> 53:05.180
Shri Mataji: What is it?

53:05.180 --> 53:09.350
[The question is repeated to Shri Mataji by
a yogi.]

53:09.350 --> 53:16.930
Shri Mataji: No, you see, it is all right.
You can do it, but why do all that? You have

53:16.930 --> 53:21.770
to be comfortably sitting in your chair and
you’ll get your Realization. You don’t

53:21.770 --> 53:23.750
have to go to Himalayas to stand on your head.
Just simple way.

53:23.750 --> 53:23.950
Yes, sir.

53:23.950 --> 53:31.350
[Another man asks, “What does the process
entail?” which is repeated to Shri Mataji

53:31.350 --> 53:34.490
in Hindi.]

53:34.490 --> 53:46.210
Shri Mataji: It’s Sahaj. It’s spontaneous.
Is like any living process. Alright?

53:46.210 --> 53:57.510
[A man asks, “Why is there so much heartache
and grief when you fall in love?”]

53:57.510 --> 54:18.109
[Yogi says, “He says, ‘When we fall in
love, why is there so much heartache and grief?'”]

54:18.109 --> 54:18.369
Shri Mataji: Because you fall.

54:18.369 --> 54:18.640
Shri Mataji: You should rise.

54:18.640 --> 54:19.369
What’s another? Behind that. Somebody else

54:19.369 --> 54:21.580
[A man asks, “What happens after death?”]

54:21.580 --> 54:23.800
[Yogi: “Life after death he is asking.”]

54:23.800 --> 54:28.710
Shri Mataji: Yes, that is all right. You see,
I must have given lots of lectures on that

54:28.710 --> 54:34.660
point also. You’d be amazed. I must have
spoken I don’t know how many times, but

54:34.660 --> 54:40.400
at least there are four thousand tapes of
Mine and this subject also I have dealt with,

54:40.400 --> 54:47.440
but what I’m saying today is let us be in
the present. Why worry about the death? All

54:47.440 --> 54:49.780
right?
Is there anybody else? Yes, please.

54:49.780 --> 55:05.330
[A man asks, “What is the connection between
sex and Kundalini and would you say something

55:05.330 --> 55:05.830
about AIDS?”]

55:05.830 --> 55:10.380
Shri Mataji: Now, here you see this red chakra
is the Mooladhara chakra, is the first chakra,

55:10.380 --> 55:16.550
is of our innocence. Our innocence is never
lost. We may do anything what we like. It

55:16.550 --> 55:25.170
is covered like a sky can be covered with
lots of clouds. Kundalini is placed above,

55:25.170 --> 55:32.290
you see. So it has nothing to do with sex
because this is the last centre, the seventh

55:32.290 --> 55:38.349
center or the first center, whatever you may
call it, is the centre of excretion, of sex

55:38.349 --> 55:43.270
and everything. It has nothing to do with
sex. On the contrary, you become innocent

55:43.270 --> 55:50.840
like a child. When the Kundalini is rising,
all these actions of excretion stop completely

55:50.840 --> 55:58.260
and all the force of our innocence helps the
Kundalini to rise. It has no relationship

55:58.260 --> 55:59.640
at all, at that time.

55:59.640 --> 56:05.440
But I don’t say there’s something wrong
in all these things, but there has to be some

56:05.440 --> 56:11.650
sanctity about it, should be some sense. People
become extremely sensible after marriage,

56:11.650 --> 56:13.480
even about sex life.

56:13.480 --> 56:22.200
AIDS have been cured with Sahaja Yoga, no
doubt, no doubt. But the patients of AIDS

56:22.200 --> 56:29.130
are of two categories I’ve seen. One who
think they are martyrs, they have achieved

56:29.130 --> 56:38.700
a great, you see, some sort of a big country
or some sort of a thing like that. They feel

56:38.700 --> 56:45.060
very enthusiastic about it. And the another
kind are the ones who don’t want to live,

56:45.060 --> 56:49.890
absolutely, just they don’t want to live.
So there are two types of people who suffer

56:49.890 --> 56:55.420
from AIDS mostly. Very few you find they are
in between. So we got rid [clarify: change

56:55.420 --> 57:01.700
to “cured”] of five of them, somehow,
in Australia. Out of them, one was a married

57:01.700 --> 57:08.550
couple who got all right and one fellow who
got all right this is nine years back, he’s

57:08.550 --> 57:13.060
still all right. But two of them, again went
to some funny habits or I don’t know what

57:13.060 --> 57:18.670
they did. The father of one of them told Me
that, “Mother, You just forgive them.”

57:18.670 --> 57:23.240
And I don’t know what happened. They again
got back their AIDS.

57:23.240 --> 57:30.200
So it’s a very difficult area in which one
has to work because they cannot be convinced

57:30.200 --> 57:35.460
that they can be cured and some of them think
that, “What’s wrong?” You see, this

57:35.460 --> 57:40.630
is the greatest mantra of the West, “What’s
wrong?” You tell them anything. “What’s

57:40.630 --> 57:45.340
wrong?” These punks were putting some sort
of horrible colors or they are becoming blind.

57:45.340 --> 57:51.480
I told them, “Why do you put these horrible
colors on your head because you are becoming

57:51.480 --> 57:56.980
blind?” “What’s wrong?” I said, “You’ll
become blind.” He said, “What’s wrong?”

57:56.980 --> 58:02.030
I mean, I just don’t know how to answer
these people. Very queer, isn’t it? They

58:02.030 --> 58:07.040
are bent upon destroying themselves. They
like to destroy. You see, the people just

58:07.040 --> 58:12.450
want to destroy themselves. I don’t know
from where this idea of destruction has come.

58:12.450 --> 58:19.910
Instead of constructing yourself, enjoying
life, anything, looking to higher goals, they

58:19.910 --> 58:27.830
always see to something filthy, dirty, something
that is absolutely inhuman, subhuman. I don’t

58:27.830 --> 58:32.200
know how these tendencies have grown.

58:32.200 --> 58:43.700
Cancer, of course, many types of cancers have
been cured. We have blood cancer. Some of

58:43.700 --> 58:48.220
them were told that you’ll die within one
month’s time because doctors are now honest

58:48.220 --> 58:53.150
and they give a certificate you are going
to die after one month. This happened about

58:53.150 --> 59:00.349
with one gentleman at least eight or nine
years back. He’s still all right and there

59:00.349 --> 59:04.970
are three of them like that who are perfectly
all right. There’s so many who have been

59:04.970 --> 59:13.030
cured, so many. So this cure takes place,
but also if you see, if God has any common

59:13.030 --> 59:18.349
sense, why should he cure people who are not
going to give light? Most of them they want

59:18.349 --> 59:27.260
to get cured and get lost. They are cured
to give light to others. We don’t repair

59:27.260 --> 59:31.230
lamps which are not going to give light. But
in compassion, I think God does that.

59:31.230 --> 59:34.150
[A man starts to ask a question.]

59:34.150 --> 59:39.099
Yogi: “He wants to get realization.”

59:39.099 --> 59:44.830
Shri Mataji: All right. Now, there’s somebody
else. Now, one more. Now, one more question.

59:44.830 --> 59:44.869
Now…

59:44.869 --> 59:45.070
[A woman asks a question.]

59:45.070 --> 59:45.430
[Yogi: “She is asking about the psychic
phenomenon, one thing. And she says when she

59:45.430 --> 01:00:04.910
is in nature, she is more at peace with herself,
her relationship.”]

01:00:04.910 --> 01:00:23.470
Shri Mataji: That’s, you see, nothing so
great. If you are in nature, anybody can feel

01:00:23.470 --> 01:00:32.670
peaceful. Or it’s like when you have everything
fine, you enjoy it, isn’t it? But when you

01:00:32.670 --> 01:00:53.680
are in Philadelphia, you should feel peaceful.
Or in New York. It’s also more difficult.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:01:05.230
[A woman asks: “When the Kundalini arises
is it in a state which stays with you all

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:05.380
the time.]

01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:05.530
[The yogi repeats the question to Shri Mataji
in Hindi.]

01:01:05.530 --> 01:01:08.220
Shri Mataji: That’s a good question. You
see, it is like a connection as I said. Some

01:01:08.220 --> 01:01:17.340
people, once they get connection, they are
connected and they grow faster and faster.

01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:23.109
But some people have a loose connection also.
So is best is to get your connection done

01:01:23.109 --> 01:01:31.000
properly. From that distance, all right.

01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:38.349
[A woman asks a question.]

01:01:38.349 --> 01:01:42.950
[Yogi asks the woman, “What’s the difference
between …?”]

01:01:42.950 --> 01:01:43.730
[The woman continues.]

01:01:43.730 --> 01:01:46.849
[Yogi: “Who are Hare Krishna? Oh here, Sahaja
Yoga and Hare Krishna.”]

01:01:46.849 --> 01:01:47.630
Shri Mataji: Tremendous.

01:01:47.630 --> 01:01:54.400
Shri Mataji: You see, in India everybody says
to each other, when they wish, “Hare Krishna”

01:01:54.400 --> 01:02:05.099
or “Hare Ram.” Are they all going to go
to God? Just understand, these are words.

01:02:05.099 --> 01:02:16.540
Get out of the webs of words. Shabtah ja alam
(check spelling) Get out of the webs of words.

01:02:16.540 --> 01:02:28.450
All right? Also, get out of books. Too much
reading books, also makes you mad. I tell

01:02:28.450 --> 01:02:33.560
you, it’s really true. Kabira has said Pari,
pari pandita mura … ? [check spelling],

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.280
means “By reading too much, even the learned
became stupid.”

01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:35.440
Shri Mataji: Now, one.

01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:36.060
[A woman asks, “How do you know if your
center is blocked?”]

01:02:36.060 --> 01:02:36.300
Shri Mataji: What’s it?

01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:45.380
[Yogi: “How do you know if your center is
blocked?”]

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:50.770
Shri Mataji: I or you?

01:02:50.770 --> 01:02:55.849
[Yogi: “No, you. She.”]

01:02:55.849 --> 01:03:02.450
Shri Mataji: You will know on your fingertips.
Alright? In English language there are certain

01:03:02.450 --> 01:03:08.450
things very good “on your fingertips.”
But also English language is little limited

01:03:08.450 --> 01:03:15.490
for spirituality because spirit is “Atma,”
is the Spirit I am talking about. “spirit”

01:03:15.490 --> 01:03:23.010
is a dead spirit, dead body. It is also alcohol,
you see. Out of these three, I am talking

01:03:23.010 --> 01:03:30.560
about which spirit people ask Me. So but fingertips
you know.

01:03:30.560 --> 01:03:41.130
[A woman asks a question.]

01:03:41.130 --> 01:03:56.960
[Yogi repeats the question in Hindi. “The
number one chakra is weak.”]

01:03:56.960 --> 01:04:08.220
Shri Mataji: It’s a little private question.
I’ll answer you privately. Alright?

01:04:08.220 --> 01:04:10.880
Who else is there?

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:13.920
[Yogi: “Yes, go ahead and ask.”]

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:15.450
Shri Mataji: Now, so many are there still.

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:26.280
[A man say: “If you, yourself, have a question,
what question would you hope somebody would

01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:34.510
ask you that nobody ever asks you?”]

01:04:34.510 --> 01:04:46.060
[Yogi repeats the question in Hindi. “He
says, if you had a question that nobody else

01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:56.060
had asked you, what would be that question?”]

01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:00.460
Shri Mataji: I didn’t follow

01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:04.589
[Yogi to man: “What are you trying to…?]

01:05:04.589 --> 01:05:05.089
[The man says, “I can ask a different way.”]
[Yogi: “Yes.”]

01:05:05.089 --> 01:05:06.650
[The man asks, “If you are in the light,
what question do you think the light…”]

01:05:06.650 --> 01:05:09.160
[Yogi: “He’s saying, ‘If you’re in
the light, what question would the light have?'”]

01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:17.150
Shri Mataji: Light has no question. It has
to give light. How can it have question? You

01:05:17.150 --> 01:05:26.140
are already enlightened, so better give light
to others. Yes, please?

01:05:26.140 --> 01:05:31.430
[A man asks a question.]

01:05:31.430 --> 01:05:34.070
[Yogi repeats the question: “How can we
improve our psychic or spiritual experience?”]

01:05:34.070 --> 01:05:39.240
Shri Mataji: That’s what I’m saying. That’s
what I’m saying. First you get your realization

01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:43.880
and then you have to go to our centers and
you’ll be amazed. We have many here who

01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:48.520
are realized souls. They look like you, but
you can see the glow on their faces.

01:05:48.520 --> 01:05:56.300
You see, now this Marathi song is such a difficult
one, even a Sanskrit song. How can these people

01:05:56.300 --> 01:06:01.410
from America sing it? Just tell Me. Yes, sir?

01:06:01.410 --> 01:06:04.740
[A man asks a question.]

01:06:04.740 --> 01:06:13.420
[Yogi: “Shri Mataji, is the spiritual heart
and the physical heart the same?]

01:06:13.420 --> 01:06:18.880
Shri Mataji: Yes. In the physical heart resides
the spiritual heart.

01:06:18.880 --> 01:06:26.880
Shri Mataji: Now, I think we have had too
many. You want to ask?

01:06:26.880 --> 01:06:28.119
[Yogi: “Do you have a question?”]

01:06:28.119 --> 01:06:29.990
Shri Mataji: She has already asked. Now, who
else has not asked, can ask.

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:30.490
Please.

01:06:30.490 --> 01:06:31.940
[A woman asks a question.]

01:06:31.940 --> 01:06:36.760
[Yogi: “What is the soul?”]

01:06:36.760 --> 01:06:44.349
Shri Mataji: That also is another big question
for which I have a big tape which you can

01:06:44.349 --> 01:06:47.970
go through and see for yourself. It will take
another lecture, all right

01:06:47.970 --> 01:06:51.330
who else?

01:06:51.330 --> 01:06:59.730
[A man asks a question.]

01:06:59.730 --> 01:07:09.820
[Yogi repeats the question in Hindi.]

01:07:09.820 --> 01:07:17.940
Cataract ne. One person has been, but, you
see, this cataract is something dead. If anything

01:07:17.940 --> 01:07:23.839
that’s dead, we cannot do it because it’s
dead. But anything that is living and in a

01:07:23.839 --> 01:07:28.650
jeopardy can be cured. All right?

01:07:28.650 --> 01:07:38.000
One [unclear killed], but he was a child.
He was a child. Madame, you’ve asked a question,

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.510
all right. Now what’s that? There.

01:07:44.510 --> 01:07:48.160
[A man starts to ask a question.]

01:07:48.160 --> 01:07:49.810
Shri Mataji: No, no, no. Not you. She’s
there at the side.

01:07:49.810 --> 01:07:54.599
[A woman asks a question concerning mental
disorder.]

01:07:54.599 --> 01:07:58.200
[Yogi repeats the question in Hindi.]

01:07:58.200 --> 01:08:06.950
Ah, of course, of course, of course. Schizophrenia,
all kinds, epilepsy, lunacy, yes, of course.

01:08:06.950 --> 01:08:13.580
Depression. Of course. Yes, yes, yes. Works
out, works out.

01:08:13.580 --> 01:08:18.219
[A man starts to ask a question.]

01:08:18.219 --> 01:08:21.429
Shri Mataji: You’ve asked a question already.

01:08:21.429 --> 01:08:22.150
[A man asks a question.]

01:08:22.150 --> 01:08:31.279
[Yogi: “Person who have birth defects, who
don’t have complete bodies, can they become

01:08:31.279 --> 01:08:31.929
whole?”]

01:08:31.929 --> 01:08:39.119
Shri Mataji: Yes, some can be. Not all. But
it’s not important, you see. It’s not

01:08:39.119 --> 01:08:45.359
a hospital. I’m just a, it’s not a hospital.
With your own power, you cure yourself. The

01:08:45.359 --> 01:08:53.529
main attention should be on the spirit, not
on the body so much. Some people have definitely

01:08:53.529 --> 01:09:02.880
have been cured. His sister-in-law was spastic.
She got cured, but some are not because they

01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:11.789
just don’t do it. They don’t follow it
and what important thing is that don’t put

01:09:11.789 --> 01:09:18.549
your attention to the physical side [unclear:
so much?], or to the mental side. Just now,

01:09:18.549 --> 01:09:27.799
we have to achieve our spiritual goal. Yes,
please?

01:09:27.799 --> 01:09:39.719
[A man asks a question.]

01:09:39.719 --> 01:09:55.170
[Yogi: “He’s asking a lot of questions
are relating to suffering and then he’s

01:09:55.170 --> 01:10:00.280
asking about Jesus, how He suffered and rose
again from the dead.”]

01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:07.059
Shri Mataji: Sufferings are because of ignorance.
That’s all I’ll say in a small sentence.

01:10:07.059 --> 01:10:13.679
All right? And if you want to get out of it,
you get the knowledge. Knowledge on your central

01:10:13.679 --> 01:10:14.499
nervous system.

01:10:14.499 --> 01:10:18.420
[Yogi: “Shall we have the realization now?”]

01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:24.150
Shri Mataji: Now, I think we should stop it
because you have asked too many questions

01:10:24.150 --> 01:10:32.840
and I’ve answered them. Actually, you see,
as I told you, it’s a mental acrobat and

01:10:32.840 --> 01:10:40.639
I can answer most of the questions very well,
but it is of no use as far as Sahaja Yoga

01:10:40.639 --> 01:10:45.929
is concerned. Mostly I’ve seen people who
ask too many questions walk off. They just

01:10:45.929 --> 01:10:48.630
come here to ask questions and then just walk
off.

01:10:48.630 --> 01:10:57.889
So, again, I request you to put your attention
on yourself and on your own spirit and on

01:10:57.889 --> 01:11:03.329
your own benevolence. Now don’t think of
anything else. You might have read a lot,

01:11:03.329 --> 01:11:06.610
you might have known a lot and it’s all
right. You are worried about the whole world.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:11.099
It doesn’t matter. Now, please this is a
time, you give some time to yourself and you

01:11:11.099 --> 01:11:21.239
worry about yourself. So now we can have our
Realization.

01:11:21.239 --> 01:11:39.510
Those who don’t want to have Realization
should leave the hall because it’s civil.

01:11:39.510 --> 01:11:50.119
Others who want to have, please be seated.
You’re welcome and I’m sure it will all

01:11:50.119 --> 01:11:51.909
work out.

01:11:51.909 --> 01:11:56.559
Another request is that you have to take out
your shoes for a short time because this Mother

01:11:56.559 --> 01:12:01.429
Earth helps us a lot.

01:12:01.429 --> 01:12:24.199
Now, whatever we are going to do it, that
is for only tonight. You don’t have to repeat

01:12:24.199 --> 01:12:29.329
it again, so there’s no need to write, there’s
nothing to worry, just you have to see that

01:12:29.329 --> 01:12:32.909
it works out.

01:12:32.909 --> 01:12:46.920
Only thing, I have to make a humble request
that during meditation don’t walk out or

01:12:46.920 --> 01:12:53.420
don’t disturb.

01:12:53.420 --> 01:13:00.369
As you know, there are two powers, one on
the left and the right, two sympathetic nervous

01:13:00.369 --> 01:13:12.800
systems. So we put both our feet apart from
each other, left and right. Left is the power

01:13:12.800 --> 01:13:16.949
of desire.

01:13:16.949 --> 01:13:35.749
Please be seated. Will you please be seated?
No, you have to sit down, please. [Shri Mataji

01:13:35.749 --> 01:13:46.780
speaks in Hindi.] All right.

01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:53.570
Left hand towards Me on your lap. I’ve again
said that you have to be comfortable, but

01:13:53.570 --> 01:14:01.929
you should not slouch. You have to be comfortable.
Please put left hand towards Me. If anything

01:14:01.929 --> 01:14:07.719
tight on your stomach [Shri Mataji speaks
in Hindi.].

01:14:07.719 --> 01:14:16.239
If you don’t want to attend you can go out.

01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:28.880
Now, you have your left hand towards Me, which
is symbolic that you want to have, or you

01:14:28.880 --> 01:14:36.630
desire to have, your Self Realization. That
you have to keep all the time like that. If

01:14:36.630 --> 01:14:42.699
you have anything tight here or tight here,
little bit loosen it. If you are comfortable,

01:14:42.699 --> 01:14:47.280
it is all right, if you are comfortable. Main
thing is you should not be uncomfortable with

01:14:47.280 --> 01:14:48.800
anything.

01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:57.389
Now, we use this right hand for action, means
nourishing our centers. We have to nourish

01:14:57.389 --> 01:15:03.690
our centers ourselves. So now, put your right
hand on your heart. You can put it under the

01:15:03.690 --> 01:15:12.139
coat; need not be under the sweater, but under
the coat. Now, in the heart, just now keep

01:15:12.139 --> 01:15:20.440
your eyes open so you can see what you have
to do. In the heart resides the spirit. Now,

01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:28.199
if you become the spirit, in the light of
the spirit, you are your own guide, you are

01:15:28.199 --> 01:15:37.440
your own master, so take your right hand on
the left hand side of your abdomen on the

01:15:37.440 --> 01:15:46.199
upper portion, we are only working on the
left hand side. This is the centre of your

01:15:46.199 --> 01:15:50.420
mastery created by the great prophets.

01:15:50.420 --> 01:15:58.869
Now take your hand in the lower portion of
your abdomen on the left hand side. This is

01:15:58.869 --> 01:16:13.199
the center of Pure Divine Knowledge. Surprisingly,
it is here, pure, divine knowledge.

01:16:13.199 --> 01:16:22.420
Then raise your hand again on top of your
abdomen, the upper portion on the left hand

01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:29.289
side and press it hard.

01:16:29.289 --> 01:16:41.809
Now raise your hand again on the heart.

01:16:41.809 --> 01:16:55.579
Now put your hand in the corner of your neck
and your shoulder and turn your head to your

01:16:55.579 --> 01:17:08.229
right. This center goes into jeopardy when
you feel guilty. I’ll tell about this later

01:17:08.229 --> 01:17:09.519
on.

01:17:09.519 --> 01:17:19.670
Now raise your hand on your forehead across
and put down your head. This is the center

01:17:19.670 --> 01:17:24.469
for forgiving everyone, even without thinking
about them.

01:17:24.469 --> 01:17:33.969
Now take your right hand on the backside of
your head. Push back your head and here you

01:17:33.969 --> 01:17:42.880
have to ask forgiveness from the Divine Power
for your own satisfaction.

01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:50.219
Now the last centre is, stretch your palm
and put the center of your palm on top of

01:17:50.219 --> 01:17:59.119
your fontanelle bone area which was a soft
bone in your childhood and put down your head.

01:17:59.119 --> 01:18:06.999
Here push back your fingers this is very important
so there’s a good pressure on your scalp.

01:18:06.999 --> 01:18:17.789
Now, please put down your head and move your
scalp seven times; clockwise slowly. Please

01:18:17.789 --> 01:18:24.400
put down your heads. Put down your heads.
Can do it better. Put down your heads and

01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:31.849
push back your fingers, very important it
is. Push back. Now, put down your head and

01:18:31.849 --> 01:18:38.860
push back your fingers so there’s a good
pressure on your scalp. That’s all we have

01:18:38.860 --> 01:18:39.739
to do.

01:18:39.739 --> 01:18:50.010
Now, there are three conditions which I’ll
tell you, which are very simple ones. The

01:18:50.010 --> 01:18:58.880
first condition is that you all have to be
absolutely confident that you’ll all get

01:18:58.880 --> 01:19:09.469
your Self Realization. Please take down your
hands. You all have to be absolutely confident

01:19:09.469 --> 01:19:25.010
that you will get your Self Realization tonight.
That means that you’re not to feel guilty

01:19:25.010 --> 01:19:38.449
at all. That means forget your past. Whatever
wrong you have done, whatever mistakes you

01:19:38.449 --> 01:19:52.229
have committed will be dissolved by this power
of Divine Love because it is the ocean of

01:19:52.229 --> 01:20:00.119
forgiveness. So you have to forgive yourself
and you don’t know when you feel guilty

01:20:00.119 --> 01:20:04.530
what happens. If you have committed mistakes,
it’s all right. After all, you are human

01:20:04.530 --> 01:20:11.030
beings, you are not gods. You face the mistakes,
finished of them. But what you do, you carry

01:20:11.030 --> 01:20:23.539
that here onto this centre here. Thus, you
get spondylitis, cervical cancer, angina or

01:20:23.539 --> 01:20:24.329
lethargic organs.

01:20:24.329 --> 01:20:32.050
So what’s the use of carrying this with
you all the time? For something that happened

01:20:32.050 --> 01:20:39.949
long time back you are carrying still. Please
know you are not guilty at all. At this moment

01:20:39.949 --> 01:20:53.510
you are not guilty at all. I assure you are
not guilty. Let the Kundalini judge you. You

01:20:53.510 --> 01:20:56.959
don’t judge yourself. Alright.

01:20:56.959 --> 01:21:11.209
The second condition is that you have to forgive
everyone without even thinking about it. You

01:21:11.209 --> 01:21:19.929
have to forgive everyone. Now, many people
say it’s difficult to forgive. Whether you

01:21:19.929 --> 01:21:26.269
forgive or you don’t forgive, you don’t
do anything. What do you do if you don’t

01:21:26.269 --> 01:21:31.449
forgive? But when you don’t forgive, then
you play into wrong hands and you torture

01:21:31.449 --> 01:21:37.030
yourself, while the person who has troubled
you or hurt you is happy. But you are torturing

01:21:37.030 --> 01:21:38.699
yourself all your life.

01:21:38.699 --> 01:21:47.320
Now, at this moment, this centre is very important
because if it is not all right the Kundalini

01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:57.769
won’t rise. And also the centre between
the optic chiasm, which is like this, is absolutely

01:21:57.769 --> 01:22:04.360
constricted. It won’t open, but when you
forgive, it opens. So, as it is, you have

01:22:04.360 --> 01:22:11.969
tortured yourself all your life by not forgiving
and at this important moment you lose the

01:22:11.969 --> 01:22:13.760
chance of your Self Realization.

01:22:13.760 --> 01:22:22.269
So, just forgive everything, everybody, everything,
even without thinking about them. We can say

01:22:22.269 --> 01:22:26.110
forgive them in general. Alright.

01:22:26.110 --> 01:22:34.199
In short, you have be pleasantly placed towards
yourself. Because you are human beings, you

01:22:34.199 --> 01:22:39.869
are at the epitome of evolution. You don’t
know what you are. So please don’t condemn

01:22:39.869 --> 01:22:45.489
yourself. Don’t, in any way, get angry with
yourself. It’s a very simple thing that

01:22:45.489 --> 01:22:49.360
will happen to you and you’ll be amazed
at your own greatness.

01:22:49.360 --> 01:22:58.449
So now, please put your left hand on your
left lap and also both the feet away from

01:22:58.449 --> 01:23:01.849
each other.

01:23:01.849 --> 01:23:12.010
Now, please put the right hand on your heart
and now close your eyes. You can take out

01:23:12.010 --> 01:23:22.479
your spectacles also because your eyesight
might improve. Now please put your right hand

01:23:22.479 --> 01:23:40.459
on your heart.

01:23:40.459 --> 01:23:50.880
Here you have to ask in your heart a question
which is very fundamental. You can call Me

01:23:50.880 --> 01:24:00.510
“Mother” or you can call Me “Shri Mataji.”
Please ask three times, “Mother, am I the

01:24:00.510 --> 01:24:14.429
Spirit?” Ask this question, “Mother, am
I the spirit?” three times. I have told

01:24:14.429 --> 01:24:22.150
you when you become the Spirit you become
your guide, your master.

01:24:22.150 --> 01:24:28.849
So now, please take your right hand to the
upper portion of your abdomen and press it

01:24:28.849 --> 01:24:42.599
hard. Here, you have to say, again three times,
ask a question which is very fundamental,

01:24:42.599 --> 01:25:09.780
“Mother, am I my own master?” Ask this
question three times.

01:25:09.780 --> 01:25:17.110
Now please take your right hand in the lower
portion of your abdomen. Here the center has

01:25:17.110 --> 01:25:31.090
got six petals, so you have to ask six times.
I must say, I cannot force pure, divine knowledge

01:25:31.090 --> 01:25:42.360
on you. You have to ask for it. So please
ask six times, “Mother, please give me Pure

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:51.909
Divine Knowledge”, in your heart, everything
to be asked in your heart, “Mother, please

01:25:51.909 --> 01:26:04.999
give me Pure Divine Knowledge”

01:26:04.999 --> 01:26:23.760
Now, as soon as you ask for Pure Divine Knowledge,
the Kundalini starts rising. So we have to

01:26:23.760 --> 01:26:30.380
nourishes the higher centers with our full
self-confidence, so now raise your right hand

01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:41.699
to the upper portion of your abdomen, on the
left hand side and here you have to say with

01:26:41.699 --> 01:26:53.159
full self-confidence, “Mother, I am my own
master”, say ten times “Mother, I am my

01:26:53.159 --> 01:26:59.409
own master”.

01:26:59.409 --> 01:27:20.729
I’ve already told you that are not this
body, this mind, this ego, this conditionings

01:27:20.729 --> 01:27:30.590
but you are the pure Spirit, so please raise
your right hand on top of your heart and here

01:27:30.590 --> 01:27:49.590
you have to say 12 times, with full confidence,
“Mother, I am the pure Spirit”.

01:27:49.590 --> 01:27:55.079
Do not say any mantras or anything and don’t
try to concentrate, just leave your attention

01:27:55.079 --> 01:28:09.329
free, the Kundalini will push it, so you just
have to put no efforts about it. This All

01:28:09.329 --> 01:28:22.769
Pervading Power is the ocean of compassion,
is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of

01:28:22.769 --> 01:28:29.420
bliss and joy and above all is the ocean of
forgiveness, so whatever mistakes you might

01:28:29.420 --> 01:28:37.739
have committed are easily dissolved into this
power of ocean of forgiveness, so please forgive

01:28:37.739 --> 01:28:44.749
yourself, and raise your hand in the corner
of your neck and shoulder and turn your head

01:28:44.749 --> 01:28:51.590
to the right.

01:28:51.590 --> 01:29:01.229
This is the center which is very bad today,
I think that you feel guilty, so please say

01:29:01.229 --> 01:29:20.780
with full confidence “Mother, I am not guilty
at all”, please say it with full confidence,

01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:32.570
sixteen times you have to say, I’ve already
told you logically, wherever you forgive or

01:29:32.570 --> 01:29:37.139
you don’t forgive, you don’t do anything.
But if you don’t forgive then you play into

01:29:37.139 --> 01:29:44.619
wrong hands, especially at this moment, you
have to forgive because the center of Agnya

01:29:44.619 --> 01:29:50.789
is very constricted and won’t open and your
Kundalini won’t raise, so it is very important

01:29:50.789 --> 01:29:58.519
now that you have to forgive, so raise your
right hand on top of your forehead across,

01:29:58.519 --> 01:30:13.550
and please put down your head, here you have
to say
from your heart, not how many times “Mother,

01:30:13.550 --> 01:30:22.289
I forgive everyone in general”, don’t
think about it, just say it, please put down

01:30:22.289 --> 01:30:33.929
your head.

01:30:33.929 --> 01:31:02.969
Now, please take your right hand to the backside
of your head, and push back your head, here,

01:31:02.969 --> 01:31:08.760
without feeling guilty, without counting your
mistake, just for your satisfaction have to

01:31:08.760 --> 01:31:21.039
say “Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me
if I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly”,

01:31:21.039 --> 01:31:31.070
“Oh, Divine Power, please forgive me if
I have done any mistakes knowingly or unknowingly”,

01:31:31.070 --> 01:31:52.340
say it from your heart, not how many times.
Please say it from

01:31:52.340 --> 01:31:59.789
your heart. Now, please stretch your palm
on your right hand and put the center of your

01:31:59.789 --> 01:32:10.449
palm on the fontanelle bone area, which was
the soft bone in your childhood. Now, this

01:32:10.449 --> 01:32:16.019
is important that you push back your fingers,
so there’s a good pressure on your scalp,

01:32:16.019 --> 01:32:24.939
now please put down your head, here again
I cannot force Sahaja Yoga on you, I cannot

01:32:24.939 --> 01:32:34.939
force Self Realization on you, so please move
your scalp seven times, clockwise, saying

01:32:34.939 --> 01:32:57.019
“Mother, please give me my self Realization”.

01:32:57.019 --> 01:33:26.130
Now, please take down your hand, open your
eyes, wear your glasses. Put both your hands

01:33:26.130 --> 01:33:38.309
towards me, like this, little higher. Now,
watch Me, without thinking, just watch Me

01:33:38.309 --> 01:33:42.559
without thinking.

01:33:42.559 --> 01:33:51.989
Now, put this right hand towards Me, like
this, bend your head, and see with your left

01:33:51.989 --> 01:33:57.949
hand if there’s a Cool Breeze coming out
of your fontanelle bone area, please bend

01:33:57.949 --> 01:34:08.309
your head; or maybe hot, please see that there’s
a cool or hot breeze coming out of your fontanelle

01:34:08.309 --> 01:34:14.590
bone area, please don’t put your hand on
top of your head, but away from it, and now

01:34:14.590 --> 01:34:34.920
see for yourself if there is a cool or hot
breeze coming from your head.

01:34:34.920 --> 01:34:48.039
Now, put your left hand towards Me, like this,
and again bend your head, and see with your

01:34:48.039 --> 01:34:54.050
right hand now if there is a cool or hot breeze
coming out of your head, sometimes it comes

01:34:54.050 --> 01:35:00.769
very far, some times closer. If it is hot,
means your have not forgiven or your are still

01:35:00.769 --> 01:35:10.489
feeling guilty, so please do it. All the heat
is coming out. Now see for yourself.

01:35:10.489 --> 01:35:19.349
Alright, now right hand towards Me, now and
with the left hand you’ll see for the last

01:35:19.349 --> 01:35:25.989
time, put down your head properly, and see
properly if there is a cool or hot breeze

01:35:25.989 --> 01:35:37.969
coming out of the your fontanelle bone area.
Now please put both the hands towards the

01:35:37.969 --> 01:35:47.239
sky, and push back your head, here you have
to ask any of these three questions, three

01:35:47.239 --> 01:35:56.059
times, “Mother, is this the Cool Breeze
of the Holy Ghost?”, or “Mother, is this

01:35:56.059 --> 01:36:03.360
the All Pervading Power of God’s Love, the
Ruh?” or “is it the Paramchaitanya?”,

01:36:03.360 --> 01:36:22.769
just ask any one of these questions three
times. Now, please put down your hands. All

01:36:22.769 --> 01:36:32.169
those who have felt cool or hot breeze on
their fingertips or palms, or in their hands

01:36:32.169 --> 01:36:38.600
or out of their fontanelle bone area, please
raise both your hands.
