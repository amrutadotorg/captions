00:08:22.375 --> 00:08:27.792
So today is Dassera, is a
very big day in India.

00:08:28.834 --> 00:08:32.375
They say on this day
Ravana was killed.

00:08:32.625 --> 00:08:36.999
He was the worst enemy
of human beings,

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:39.792
and he was killed.

00:08:40.041 --> 00:08:42.667
But whatever
it is then,

00:08:42.917 --> 00:08:46.959
as a memory

00:08:47.166 --> 00:08:50.458
of that great man,

00:08:50.667 --> 00:08:56.542
Shri Ram, they celebrate
today Dassera.

00:08:57.417 --> 00:09:01.375
And on this day,
they say

00:09:01.625 --> 00:09:05.667
those who are dushtas
means "bad people"

00:09:05.917 --> 00:09:11.333
or we can say negative,
they are killed.

00:09:11.625 --> 00:09:13.999
Can you imagine?

00:09:14.667 --> 00:09:20.375
So this day is regarded as
a very important day in India,

00:09:23.834 --> 00:09:28.792
and they make a big
statue of Ravana.

00:09:30.291 --> 00:09:32.917
You all know who
was Ravana?

00:09:33.083 --> 00:09:35.250
Yes, Shri Mataji.

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.333
Whom Shri Rama
killed?

00:09:55.291 --> 00:09:58.875
He was a horrible
fellow,

00:09:59.458 --> 00:10:03.834
and he took away
the wife of Shri Ram.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:07.458
Sita, by force.

00:10:09.166 --> 00:10:12.999
But she was such
a chaste woman

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.166
that he couldn't
touch her.

00:10:16.500 --> 00:10:19.750
He tried, he couldn't
touch her.

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.750
He couldn´t achieve
any power over her.

00:10:24.959 --> 00:10:28.834
On the contrary she
was very powerful.

00:10:30.583 --> 00:10:32.625
So

00:10:33.291 --> 00:10:36.834
at that time
Shri Rama's

00:10:37.458 --> 00:10:41.166
mother-in-law,
I should say,

00:10:42.333 --> 00:10:45.875
who was the wife
of Dasharatha,

00:10:47.917 --> 00:10:49.500
she said,

00:10:49.917 --> 00:10:52.083
she used to ...

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:59.208
she is like
a big "saadhuni".

00:10:59.667 --> 00:11:05.083
And she said that,
from today

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:09.750
two marriages are not
allowed, only one.

00:11:10.250 --> 00:11:14.166
So among Hindus there
is only one marriage.

00:11:14.583 --> 00:11:17.792
They don't have
two marriages

00:11:19.750 --> 00:11:23.917
and regard it
as very sinful

00:11:24.375 --> 00:11:27.458
to have another
woman,

00:11:28.458 --> 00:11:31.583
according to Indian
culture.

00:11:33.709 --> 00:11:36.250
There are some
people who do it,

00:11:36.458 --> 00:11:40.875
but it is wrong,
is not Indian.

00:11:42.250 --> 00:11:45.959
The father-in-law
passed a law,

00:11:47.125 --> 00:11:52.709
because he has..he suffered...
He had two wives

00:11:53.834 --> 00:11:59.041
and one of them tried
to send Shri Ram

00:12:00.166 --> 00:12:02.583
to the jungle.

00:12:03.667 --> 00:12:06.083
She was so cruel,

00:12:06.709 --> 00:12:09.834
because she
wanted her son

00:12:10.125 --> 00:12:12.125
to become the king

00:12:12.375 --> 00:12:17.166
and as it was the mistake
of the father

00:12:17.709 --> 00:12:20.583
that he had promised

00:12:20.834 --> 00:12:25.417
that he will
give her

00:12:25.792 --> 00:12:28.375
a boon

00:12:29.917 --> 00:12:34.375
because she had
saved him in war.

00:12:36.083 --> 00:12:38.750
And so now

00:12:39.458 --> 00:12:44.709
she asked him
to send Shri Ram,

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:50.041
to the "vanavas"
- to the jungle.

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:57.542
By second one,
she asked

00:12:57.792 --> 00:13:01.875
to give the kingdom
to her son,

00:13:02.166 --> 00:13:04.999
who was Lakshmana,

00:13:06.291 --> 00:13:10.125
but when Lakshmana came
he didn't want.

00:13:10.458 --> 00:13:14.041
He said: "I don't want to
take Shri Rama's

00:13:14.291 --> 00:13:18.500
seat because
it is his right."

00:13:18.917 --> 00:13:23.542
So he went to Shri Ram
in the jungle,

00:13:23.792 --> 00:13:27.458
requested him:
"You must come,

00:13:28.625 --> 00:13:34.041
you must come to Ajodhya
to the capital city

00:13:34.709 --> 00:13:37.542
and you should
be crowned."

00:13:37.875 --> 00:13:40.667
Shri Ram said:
"I can't do it.

00:13:40.875 --> 00:13:45.041
I have to fulfil my
father's wish."

00:13:47.792 --> 00:13:51.291
But at that moment,

00:13:51.542 --> 00:13:54.834
the father said
that in India

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:57.999
nobody will have
second marriage.

00:13:58.250 --> 00:14:03.250
Because of two wives
the whole family suffered,

00:14:03.625 --> 00:14:07.417
so he said: "Only we
can have one wife

00:14:07.709 --> 00:14:10.208
and no two wives."

00:14:10.625 --> 00:14:15.500
Very surprising
that even till today

00:14:16.333 --> 00:14:21.250
in India they believe that you
should have only one wife.

00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.417
But what you find
in other countries

00:14:26.709 --> 00:14:30.709
that people may not
have another wife

00:14:31.041 --> 00:14:34.083
but they have affairs

00:14:34.333 --> 00:14:37.500
and they do not
respect their wives.

00:14:38.166 --> 00:14:40.834
This is very sad

00:14:41.583 --> 00:14:48.083
and this makes
the country suffering,

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:52.250
because if the women
are treated like that,

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.999
the women suffer

00:14:55.250 --> 00:14:59.166
and if the mother suffers,
the children suffer.

00:14:59.959 --> 00:15:02.166
So he made a law

00:15:02.417 --> 00:15:05.999
that nobody
will marry twice.

00:15:11.417 --> 00:15:14.041
Only Mohammed Sahib
said: "All right,

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:17.375
we can have
four marriages",

00:15:17.583 --> 00:15:20.250
because

00:15:21.917 --> 00:15:24.792
there was so
much killing,

00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:31.000
and so few
men were left.

00:15:32.166 --> 00:15:37.750
Many women and
very few men.

00:15:38.083 --> 00:15:43.500
So he said that: "All right, you
can have four wives each

00:15:43.709 --> 00:15:46.458
solve the problem."

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:50.333
He does not, he does
not solve the problem!

00:15:51.625 --> 00:15:55.750
Even the Muslims
now have this problem.

00:15:56.083 --> 00:15:59.875
They marry four
times, no doubt,

00:16:00.208 --> 00:16:05.625
but if you see their family
life, they are very sad.

00:16:06.917 --> 00:16:11.667
We Indians should not
learn anything from them.

00:16:12.417 --> 00:16:16.291
On the contrary, we have
to tell the whole world

00:16:16.542 --> 00:16:19.999
that - don´t run
after women.

00:16:20.291 --> 00:16:22.875
Look after yourself.

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:26.500
Which is...

00:16:27.834 --> 00:16:33.083
in the West people
have no sense.

00:16:33.875 --> 00:16:38.583
They have one wife, of course
they don´t have two wives,

00:16:39.083 --> 00:16:42.291
but they carry on

00:16:43.208 --> 00:16:45.875
with another woman.

00:16:49.417 --> 00:16:52.917
In Sahaja yoga
it is banned

00:16:53.834 --> 00:16:56.375
to do these things,

00:16:56.583 --> 00:17:01.250
and if they do it like that,
I tell them that you divorce

00:17:02.875 --> 00:17:06.208
and then I arrange
their marriages.

00:17:06.417 --> 00:17:09.166
But very sad

00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:14.375
because why should they, under
the influence of western life,

00:17:14.625 --> 00:17:18.166
try to have
another wife

00:17:19.041 --> 00:17:22.834
and make to whole
thing so polluted.

00:17:24.917 --> 00:17:28.917
Their children suffer,
mainly.

00:17:29.458 --> 00:17:33.709
If the morality of the
place is not good

00:17:36.250 --> 00:17:40.375
the new generation,
the children, they suffer.

00:17:41.959 --> 00:17:45.999
And what do we have
is a sick country.

00:17:50.542 --> 00:17:53.709
English were,
once upon a time,

00:17:53.959 --> 00:17:58.667
very proud and
very sensible.

00:17:58.917 --> 00:18:01.542
But now

00:18:01.999 --> 00:18:04.999
they become
very unhappy.

00:18:05.375 --> 00:18:09.959
because they don´t
believe in one wife.

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:15.208
They´ll have one wife at home and
another wife somewhere else,

00:18:15.875 --> 00:18:18.792
and this is
a very sad thing.

00:18:18.999 --> 00:18:22.834
In Sahaja yoga we
do not tolerate it.

00:18:23.834 --> 00:18:29.917
You have to have one wife and
you have to live with one wife.

00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:33.709
Some women are
obstinate - all right I say,

00:18:33.959 --> 00:18:36.542
you can leave
Sahaja yoga.

00:18:37.166 --> 00:18:40.667
And some men are
also very troublesome,

00:18:40.959 --> 00:18:44.000
so I tell them you
leave Sahaja yoga.

00:18:44.291 --> 00:18:47.500
If you want to have
the advantage

00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:50.208
of being Sahaja yogi

00:18:50.417 --> 00:18:54.083
then you cannot
marry another woman

00:18:54.333 --> 00:18:56.542
or another man.

00:18:57.375 --> 00:19:01.667
You have to lead a happy
life with each other.

00:19:02.375 --> 00:19:07.417
If you can´t do it, then you
get out of Sahaja yoga.

00:19:09.333 --> 00:19:13.542
But there are some people
who had horrible times

00:19:13.792 --> 00:19:16.792
with their wives
or husbands

00:19:17.542 --> 00:19:20.709
so what I have
said that: "All right

00:19:20.959 --> 00:19:23.291
those who are

00:19:23.542 --> 00:19:29.792
flirting and are not having
a proper personality,

00:19:29.999 --> 00:19:33.041
they can't be in
a Sahaja yoga."

00:19:33.999 --> 00:19:37.750
We have to make
a very pure society,

00:19:38.083 --> 00:19:43.500
our duty is to show that
we can live happily

00:19:44.291 --> 00:19:46.999
without fighting.

00:19:47.792 --> 00:19:53.500
And the Sahaja yogis are known
to be very sensible husbands.

00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:57.917
I am very happy
to see you all here,

00:19:58.166 --> 00:20:02.583
I know some of them,
I have married them,

00:20:02.834 --> 00:20:05.583
and they are
very happy.

00:20:13.999 --> 00:20:19.542
So I have to tell all of
you, men and women,

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.166
that we have to lead
a dedicated life.

00:20:24.709 --> 00:20:28.834
If the husband is flirting,
let him go to the hell

00:20:29.250 --> 00:20:33.291
or if the wife is flirting
let her go to hell.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.166
We are Sahaja yogis, and we have
to keep our characters good.

00:20:40.959 --> 00:20:44.792
If you have
a good character,

00:20:45.041 --> 00:20:49.291
you enjoy life
of your own.

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:53.041
If you have
a frivolous life

00:20:53.291 --> 00:20:55.583
you can never
enjoy.

00:20:55.875 --> 00:20:59.583
You go running after
this one and that one.

00:20:59.792 --> 00:21:03.333
Such people can
never be happy

00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:09.542
and they do all kinds of
nonsense and waste their lives.

00:21:09.792 --> 00:21:12.999
But by the
time they die

00:21:13.208 --> 00:21:16.250
their condition
is so bad,

00:21:17.041 --> 00:21:18.917
very bad,

00:21:19.125 --> 00:21:21.999
such people
suffer a lot.

00:21:22.250 --> 00:21:26.667
I have seen
them suffering,

00:21:26.959 --> 00:21:30.083
suffering so badly.

00:21:31.417 --> 00:21:35.709
So we are husband and
wife to enjoy each other

00:21:35.959 --> 00:21:41.917
and to lead a happy life,
not to become miserable.

00:21:44.667 --> 00:21:48.792
All of you now
married in Sahaja yoga

00:21:49.041 --> 00:21:53.999
maybe some of
you - haven´t tested

00:21:54.667 --> 00:21:56.875
a good married life

00:21:57.083 --> 00:22:02.417
but what to do? That´s not
the mistake with Sahaja yoga,

00:22:02.792 --> 00:22:08.000
it is a mistake
with you, yourself,

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.917
and mistake
with your wife.

00:22:12.625 --> 00:22:16.999
So everybody must
stand up on their right

00:22:17.208 --> 00:22:20.125
and lead
the right life

00:22:20.375 --> 00:22:24.083
instead of wasting
energy

00:22:24.333 --> 00:22:27.667
over quarrelling
and fighting.

00:22:27.959 --> 00:22:33.667
Try to find out, why do you
quarrel and why do you fight,

00:22:33.917 --> 00:22:38.875
on what points there
are differences.

00:22:39.999 --> 00:22:43.542
There has to be difference,
doesn’t matter.

00:22:44.208 --> 00:22:47.959
After all, you
are two persons,

00:22:48.166 --> 00:22:50.750
there has to be
differences,

00:22:50.999 --> 00:22:55.417
but difference should
not create problem.

00:22:55.667 --> 00:22:59.834
On the contrary you must
enjoy the difference,

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.583
as long as, you aren't
a dedicated wife

00:23:04.834 --> 00:23:09.999
and you aren't a dedicated husband,
you can never enjoy life.

00:23:10.208 --> 00:23:13.875
All the time you will
be worried and upset.

00:23:15.125 --> 00:23:19.500
So all of you I thank
you very much,

00:23:22.083 --> 00:23:26.750
that on such a great auspicious
day you all have come.

00:23:27.250 --> 00:23:30.333
And all look
very happy.

00:23:32.583 --> 00:23:35.500
Thank you very much.
