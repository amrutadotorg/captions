00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.400
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.890
Speaking before the doctors,

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.520
I think of My college days,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.560
while I was also studying medicine

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:36.600
but luckily or unluckily our college stopped completely,

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.730
in Lahore and I had to give up My studies.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:49.230
Not that I had no faith in this western education of medicine

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.650
but it was a good chance by connecting this to that

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:01.940
and understanding what is missing in the western medical education.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.190
The missing point is this,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:19.810
that human beings are considered in the medical science

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.150
as something very individual

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.890
and not connected with the whole.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.350
We are all connected with the whole.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.440
But how to convince people

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.850
that you are all connected with the whole

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.560
and that you are not singled out?

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.440
As we are connected with the whole

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:54.650
all our problems are connected with the whole.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.060
You cannot just consider somebody as the patient of one thing

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.480
and another patient of another thing,

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.310
could be that one person who has one trouble,

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.020
could be having so many other troubles,

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.480
so many other connections

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.150
which we do not locate in the western medical sience.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.020
For example, to see a person

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.770
medically very sick, may be,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.890
but you don't know, what is his mental condition?

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.150
What is he doing mentally?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.150
Is he all right mentally

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.850
or only he is physically something wrong with him?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.230
Now absolutely we know about so many things, like say,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.980
medically we have names for that,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.520
that this is a psychosomatic problem

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:10.480
or this is a somatic problem,

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.520
but what is the relationship between the two that we don't know.

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:23.270
You'll be amazed most of our diseases come from psychosomatic,

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:29.520
like cancer, which are incurable mostly, cancer

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:33.270
and we can say AIDS,

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:39.520
all such which are supposed to be absolutely incurable

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.650
and difficult,

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:46.310
all that come with our connection, with our connection,

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.150
which we are not sure of,

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.690
with the left side. As we, you have seen here  in picture, left side,

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:55.060
I don't know.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.730
We know only the right side medical science

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.310
and that too in such details,

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:06.600
it is not necessary,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:12.560
you must also know the left side of a human being

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:17.940
and about left side we are absolutely not aware.

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.560
For example, a person who is mad,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.730
lunatic, he is in the lunatic asylum.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.770
He doesn't get heart trouble, why?

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.770
How has he got mad? What is his connection

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:51.520
with ourselves?

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:57.730
For example, you take a patient

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.060
who is suffering, say, from cancer.

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.270
We know a lot about cancer, no doubt,

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:11.020
how virus is started and all that, that we know.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:14.940
But how cancer is caused no one knows

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.730
and to what type of people cancer comes in, you don't know.

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:27.940
Now these are two, as you see, there are two channels within us,

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:33.400
one looks after the right side and one looks after the left side.

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:38.190
Now if you have a problem in the left side

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:45.480
then problems psychosomatic can come in.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:50.100
Supposing, your hand is broken or

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:55.850
is there some sort of a physical problem then it's all right.

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:00.690
But when it is the complicated psychosomatic trouble

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:04.190
then doctors cannot cure it, I am sorry to say.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.980
Because you don't know the other side of side of it,

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:15.440
what is affecting the patient to get this cancer, you don't know.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:20.350
You will be happy to know in Sahaja Yoga

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.400
cancer is curable,

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.270
curable if it is at a very early stage

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:32.060
it's very easy but otherwise also.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:35.650
Specially blood cancer

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:40.270
is absolutely curable.

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.600
You will be amazed that it is

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.980
such a combination of these two sides of our life,

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:55.440
that we get into these diseases which are incurable.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.730
There is a big list of these incurable diseases

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:00.560
which I don't want to tell you

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:02.850
which you know very well.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.440
So in all of them there is a complication of the left side.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:11.480
Of course you know about right side very much,

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:16.600
Gray's anatomy and after that all you know, but

00:07:16.890 --> 00:07:21.810
you don't know how you get affected by the left side.

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.150
So in this lecture, I would like to tell you something about the left side,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:34.650
which you have never heard of maybe, and you don't believe into.

00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:40.020
The left side belongs to our past,

00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:45.020
to our past in the sense that

00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:51.850
those people who are futuristic do not get affected by left side,

00:07:52.230 --> 00:07:54.890
but those people who live in the left side,

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:56.980
are worried about their left side,

00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:00.890
are sorry for themselves, whatever it is,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:05.100
they are the ones who get affected.

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:12.230
Left sided person if I tell you, you will be shocked to hear,

00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:15.900
is actually possessed.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:22.350
Possessed by some dead spirit which must be a knowledge to you.

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:26.480
You may not be believing in it but it is.

00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.770
It can happen to anyone who gets

00:08:33.020 --> 00:08:39.020
sad or gets into the left sided temperament,

00:08:39.600 --> 00:08:44.480
Also there are so many other things like these false gurus,

00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:47.400
what they do, they mesmerize,

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.520
mesmerize you with

00:08:49.770 --> 00:08:52.980
dead  spirits which they have to control.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.690
This side

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:59.730
of, I should say, not medicine non-medicine,

00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:04.350
but whatever it is, should be known to the doctors;

00:09:04.650 --> 00:09:08.690
otherwise you cannot do any curing.

00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:11.850
You can, maybe, diagnosis you might do.

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:14.190
But you cannot cure people

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:17.690
who are suffering from psychosomatic troubles.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:21.310
Today's medical problem is that

00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:27.770
they cannot cure psychosomatic diseases.

00:09:28.150 --> 00:09:29.940
For that you don't have to spend so many years,

00:09:30.190 --> 00:09:32.480
as we do for MBBS.

00:09:32.690 --> 00:09:37.480
It's a very, very short course, if you can do that.

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:43.940
Firstly, you should be connected to the divine force,

00:09:44.270 --> 00:09:48.440
that's very important, that's not difficult at all,

00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:55.690
but after that you have to maintain your spiritual abilities.

00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:00.980
One of the spiritual ability is innocence,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.270
the first chakra that you see

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:08.850
is innocence.

00:10:09.650 --> 00:10:11.900
If you are a innocent person,

00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:17.690
you can easily cure all such people who are suffering

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.890
from such incurable diseases.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.900
I would say that one should first of all

00:10:29.230 --> 00:10:33.100
try to get self realization, that's important.

00:10:33.350 --> 00:10:37.810
When the Kundalini rises, She pierces through your fontanel bone area

00:10:38.020 --> 00:10:42.310
and you are connected with the divine force which is all over.

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:47.560
You need not believe Me, but you get your selfrealization

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.730
If you have your self realization,

00:10:50.940 --> 00:10:53.560
then you will be capable to understand

00:10:53.770 --> 00:10:59.810
what sort of combination your patient has.

00:11:00.810 --> 00:11:03.350
Is he only physically suffering

00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:08.980
or he has this combination of left side?

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.690
The other day I was surprised, a child came to Me,

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.850
he was suffering from meningitis.

00:11:20.810 --> 00:11:22.810
He got cured

00:11:24.150 --> 00:11:29.150
and the parents didn't understand how did he get cured.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:32.940
Then when the boy got cured I asked him:

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:35.810
"Who is your friend?"

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:41.520
He said, this particular boy, who has a particular guru.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.020
All right.

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:45.770
And I go in his house

00:11:45.980 --> 00:11:50.940
and go on watching that guru all the time, can you imagine?

00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:55.190
There are many doctors also

00:11:55.520 --> 00:11:59.520
who get involved with these bad gurus.

00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:04.270
You must know, unless and until you are realized,

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:11.520
you will not know who is truthful and who is correct.

00:12:12.650 --> 00:12:16.060
An innocent boy suffering from meningitis

00:12:16.270 --> 00:12:19.600
and overnight he got cured.

00:12:20.770 --> 00:12:23.480
You'll be amazed at

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:29.560
the great experience of Sahaja Yoga

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:33.350
and it is too great a surprise,

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.230
that's why people don't accept it.

00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:40.190
But we have many cases by which we can show,

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.270
that people who were supposed to be incurable are cured.

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:54.850
So many people, especially with serious diseases, like cancer.

00:12:55.890 --> 00:12:58.520
I mean in the medical science for cancer,

00:12:58.730 --> 00:13:00.890
they will go on like this, like that,

00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:04.150
till they shave you off completely.

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:06.890
But not in Sahaja Yoga,

00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:11.150
immediately you will know that this man is possessed.

00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:15.770
Now this line to Medical Science is absolutely not there,

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.810
but in our country we always believed in that.

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:22.480
We have certain rules and regulations

00:13:22.730 --> 00:13:26.480
about people who are dead. How to behave?

00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.440
How to go to Shamshan (MEANS Cremation ground)

00:13:29.690 --> 00:13:34.650
and all that. There is a particular type of

00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:38.100
understanding

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:42.730
of all these dead bodies,

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:45.060
how they behave, Where do they go?

00:13:45.310 --> 00:13:48.850
And is I think a very big part

00:13:49.060 --> 00:13:53.190
of your knowledge, very big part.

00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.690
So many diseases, incurable, you cannot cure,

00:13:57.900 --> 00:14:01.150
which are mostly coming from the left side.

00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:03.850
Medical science can cure the right side.

00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:06.600
I know that, that they can do it.

00:14:06.890 --> 00:14:11.020
But cancer they will go on postponing from one to another,

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:16.150
they'll operate, then it will spread, this and that.

00:14:16.440 --> 00:14:21.190
Operation is not the way to cure, it's not.

00:14:21.850 --> 00:14:27.190
If you are expert  in Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to operate.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:31.310
Overnight you can cure, overnight you can cure

00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:33.560
cancer patient, believe Me.

00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:37.560
You are quite capable of doing that. Especially Indians,

00:14:37.850 --> 00:14:41.310
because Indians have a special capacity.

00:14:41.560 --> 00:14:46.350
I should say what special blessing of this country.

00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:50.400
We don't know this country how great it is,

00:14:50.690 --> 00:14:55.060
but we are only dealing with the western education,

00:14:55.440 --> 00:15:00.730
where have they reached, these western people in their experiments,

00:15:00.940 --> 00:15:02.890
I just don't understand.

00:15:03.100 --> 00:15:06.100
Their children are taking to drugs,

00:15:06.690 --> 00:15:09.400
their families are disturbed,

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.230
everything is so upset.

00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.650
Not that I decry this education, not at all.

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:19.890
But it is not complete

00:15:20.150 --> 00:15:23.150
and you should have the other side of it.

00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:27.350
Otherwise, don't have a cancer hospital.

00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:32.940
Only have physical things

00:15:33.190 --> 00:15:35.810
by which you will work it out

00:15:36.020 --> 00:15:39.060
but if you want to have

00:15:39.350 --> 00:15:42.400
patients of all types,

00:15:42.770 --> 00:15:45.730
then you must know the other side.

00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:50.440
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing to be upset,

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:54.230
but it's a knowledge which you should have as doctors,

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.150
because I think the medical science  is still not complete

00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:03.350
that as Doctor Aggarwal himself has said it.

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:09.890
But what is lacking in it, the know- ledge of the left side that we have.

00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:13.850
Now if I should say that

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:16.730
I didn't read it in any book,

00:16:16.940 --> 00:16:18.980
I didn't get it from any book,

00:16:19.230 --> 00:16:21.600
but only when I was

00:16:21.810 --> 00:16:26.060
working with Sahaja Yoga, with people, I discovered

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.730
that compared to India, western people

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:32.350
are much more affected by the left side, much more.

00:16:34.230 --> 00:16:37.940
much more. And they cannot understand

00:16:38.150 --> 00:16:42.890
how they are sick, what has happened to them.

00:16:43.190 --> 00:16:48.150
Even if you take a very limited area of treatment

00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:52.350
of a human welfare

00:16:52.770 --> 00:16:58.520
then is a very important part is the left side

00:16:59.100 --> 00:17:02.230
Supposing a lady who is all the time crying

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:05.690
and weeping and unhappy,

00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.890
she can get cancer.

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:14.310
Now there are two types,

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.940
one also right sided diseases,

00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:19.520
one is of course the left side.

00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:21.850
In the right sided people,

00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.270
who are extremely, I should say, aggressive,

00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:31.440
extremely overpowering, controlling type,

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.810
of course they have a very bad liver, I must say.

00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:37.890
They have a very bad liver

00:17:38.100 --> 00:17:44.270
and when they get like that they cross all the limits

00:17:44.730 --> 00:17:47.060
and when they cross all the limits

00:17:47.310 --> 00:17:53.480
they get such diseases which you cannot find out, you cannot cure.

00:17:54.890 --> 00:17:58.190
One of them is the disease of the liver,

00:17:58.480 --> 00:18:02.890
I think doctors can't cure liver. They may try,

00:18:03.150 --> 00:18:08.190
but can't cure liver as Sahaja Yoga can cure.

00:18:10.020 --> 00:18:13.690
And such a person  whose temperament, he's so hot tempered

00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.480
and he's  so aggressive and this and that,

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:23.810
he suffers from that horrible liver

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:28.310
and develops all kinds of complications.

00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:32.770
There are so many other diseases also

00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:35.520
on the right side, so many other.

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.810
But mainly I think is a disease of the liver.

00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:42.980
Liver is lived with.

00:18:43.350 --> 00:18:48.600
And if your liver is out, there is no solution in the allopathy.

00:18:48.810 --> 00:18:52.770
May be little bit here and little bit there.

00:18:53.810 --> 00:18:56.600
But at the climax of it,

00:18:56.940 --> 00:19:02.560
with the liver one can fade, one can even die.

00:19:05.900 --> 00:19:10.020
In the West, liver problem is very common

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.060
and there is no solution for them for that.

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:18.810
They go on living with it

00:19:18.980 --> 00:19:23.980
and doctors just admit them in the hospital.

00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:29.230
These are not incurable, they are absolutely curable.

00:19:29.480 --> 00:19:32.850
Because we haven't got that knowledge

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:39.770
and that's why we call them incurable. No, they're not.

00:19:40.650 --> 00:19:43.060
I do not want to blame other diseases,

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:48.890
but there are so many of them, which cannot be even diagnosed

00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:53.270
and which cannot be cured by the medical science.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:56.690
Which we must accept first of all,

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.020
that that is the situation.

00:19:59.270 --> 00:20:03.520
We may go on trying doing anything

00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.650
but we cannot cure.

00:20:05.890 --> 00:20:10.020
So many types of medicines will come out, we cannot cure.

00:20:10.350 --> 00:20:12.650
Because what I am trying to tell you

00:20:12.850 --> 00:20:14.310
that's only half part

00:20:14.520 --> 00:20:19.270
of your being is discussed.

00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:23.600
In that also so many things are not there.

00:20:23.890 --> 00:20:26.650
Take it for example asthma,

00:20:26.890 --> 00:20:31.310
asthma cannot be cured by doctors, is a fact

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.890
but Sahaja Yoga can absolutely cure

00:20:36.190 --> 00:20:39.480
Allergies also can be cured by us.

00:20:39.730 --> 00:20:44.270
Because if you have the roots of all the troubles,

00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:46.890
if you know about the roots,

00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:50.730
not pharmaceutical and all that but real roots,

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:55.190
then you  can handle the situation and you can cure.

00:20:55.480 --> 00:21:00.560
We haven't got any yet a college or anything so far in Sahaja Yoga.

00:21:00.810 --> 00:21:05.150
I wish we could. But hospital we have.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:10.600
We have a hospital in Belapur, they call it

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.520
New Bombay, where they are treating people.

00:21:15.770 --> 00:21:18.480
Only they have to pay for their stay

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:22.690
and it's hardly I think 300 rupees per day

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:28.900
for poor people. But you don't need any medicine,

00:21:29.270 --> 00:21:31.850
you don't have to pay for anything.

00:21:32.060 --> 00:21:34.890
For our country which is so poor,

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:37.690
don't you think, it's very important?

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:41.270
Otherwise you go for X-ray,

00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.890
then you go for another test,

00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:50.100
then for another test and nothing comes out of it.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:57.190
One should only know how to deal with it.

00:21:58.900 --> 00:22:03.400
Now supposing somebody's leg is broken - finished,

00:22:03.650 --> 00:22:09.100
cut his leg, put another leg. No need,

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:12.850
I assure you there is no need.

00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:18.440
Now we have some doctors in Sahaja Yoga, very good.

00:22:18.730 --> 00:22:22.230
Some of them are in America, some of them are in Italy

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.730
and some of them are in Russia.

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:27.890
Russian doctors are very good.

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.440
I don't know how they think

00:22:30.650 --> 00:22:33.850
that there is something beyond this education

00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.730
and they are trying to learn it.

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:39.730
If you can make any facility,

00:22:39.940 --> 00:22:42.150
I will be very happy but in any case

00:22:42.350 --> 00:22:44.350
I am thinking of starting

00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.810
a Sahaja Yoga hospital in your country

00:22:49.020 --> 00:22:51.480
specially in Delhi,

00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.350
in Greater Noida

00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.810
and if some of your doctors can join us

00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:03.520
help us a lot.

00:23:03.940 --> 00:23:08.150
In Greater Noida I am thinking of starting

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:11.560
a college or we can call it a school

00:23:11.810 --> 00:23:15.980
we'll get the students as well as doctors

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:20.890
who can cure people. And there will be...

00:23:22.350 --> 00:23:24.690
And there will be no charges for treatment.

00:23:24.890 --> 00:23:28.400
Of course, where they stay, if they come and stay there

00:23:28.650 --> 00:23:31.770
then they might have to pay for  their food, that's all.

00:23:32.060 --> 00:23:34.850
Otherwise this is an arrangement I am having

00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.770
and anybody who wants to join as a doctor, also

00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:43.730
we'll like to accept their services.

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:48.020
How much will be the pay I don't now, but not much I would say,

00:23:48.270 --> 00:23:52.890
we'll pay about 6000 to 7000 per month to a doctor.

00:23:53.190 --> 00:23:54.980
But he has to be a Sahaja yogi

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:58.600
and he should know the method of Sahaja Yoga.

00:23:58.900 --> 00:24:01.900
I think, it is one of

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:06.060
the very generous feeling

00:24:06.350 --> 00:24:09.770
that in our country so many die

00:24:09.940 --> 00:24:14.400
because they cannot get into the hospital, they cannot get treated.

00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:21.560
If you can give some time to this project of Mine,

00:24:21.810 --> 00:24:27.520
I am sure I'll be able to organize a good hospital

00:24:27.810 --> 00:24:31.060
for those people. In that we'll have

00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:35.020
somatic patients as well as psychosomatic patients

00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.810
all kinds of patients we'll have.

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:40.730
And you will learn so much

00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:45.150
because it's a very subtle and deep knowledge.

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:50.890
Just cannot learn it on the book, you have to have experiment

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.270
with the patient. You will be amazed,

00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:56.690
how you will be curing people.

00:24:56.890 --> 00:25:01.520
It´s not book of knowledge, it's a very, very practical knowledge

00:25:01.770 --> 00:25:07.810
and those who have that charitable temperament

00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.150
can do very well and learn a lot.

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:13.890
One thing I must tell you

00:25:14.060 --> 00:25:17.600
Sahaja Yoga has one bad point also,

00:25:17.850 --> 00:25:22.150
that you cannot make money, you cannot.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:26.190
If you try making money out of it, you fail.

00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:30.980
Some or other this money business is little higher

00:25:31.190 --> 00:25:34.730
for Sahaja Yogis, they cannot manage with it.

00:25:35.060 --> 00:25:38.100
But you can give service.

00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:45.600
Now we had a very nice retired doctor in this Belapur hospital

00:25:45.890 --> 00:25:48.060
and he did very well,

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:51.270
now he is no more. He worked very hard

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:55.270
but his daughter in law is now looking after that.

00:25:56.270 --> 00:25:59.770
If you want, if you are retired people,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.270
if you are not in need of money

00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:06.770
much money then it's a very good thing.

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:13.100
Also we provide, say, a residence,

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:18.270
food, everything, can be managed, it's not so difficult,

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:22.350
but it's not a very money oriented

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:26.350
I must say since I was studying medical,

00:26:26.600 --> 00:26:31.520
now medical line has become very money oriented,

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:34.150
I am surprised. I am sorry to say,

00:26:34.350 --> 00:26:36.480
but they have become very money oriented

00:26:36.650 --> 00:26:39.190
and some of your doctors have gone to America

00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.060
and have befooled people so much

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:46.600
and have made so much money that you feel ashamed to be an Indian,

00:26:46.810 --> 00:26:47.650
it's like that.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.480
You can't make much money

00:26:49.690 --> 00:26:53.980
but as retired people you can join us and help us

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.230
and some of you can come to learn Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.350
Hardly within say months time you will be experts.

00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:05.730
You can diagnose the thing without any delay.

00:27:05.940 --> 00:27:09.100
You don't have to go to any laboratory or anything,

00:27:09.350 --> 00:27:12.440
immediately you will know what's the trouble.

00:27:12.690 --> 00:27:17.100
And all sorts of incurable diseases you can try.

00:27:17.350 --> 00:27:23.270
I am amazed Myself as to how it is working with people.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.940
Now all these awards and all that they have given Me

00:27:27.190 --> 00:27:30.060
because I have cured people and done that

00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:32.810
but I don't have a hospital there.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.940
First hospital I want to have in Delhi and here I want to work it out.

00:27:38.150 --> 00:27:42.810
Let us think of working it out ourselves.

00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:48.520
It's a charitable hospital and it's very sensible,

00:27:48.690 --> 00:27:51.520
I have already got money to build,

00:27:51.730 --> 00:27:56.480
but only thing I need some doctors who can help Me,

00:27:56.730 --> 00:27:58.770
it´s a very stunning thing Sahaja Yoga,

00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:01.730
if you come you will be amazed how it works.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:03.310
I know

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:07.100
never been that, we have never been connected to the divine.

00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:10.190
We have never used that forces of the divine

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:16.060
and once you start using those forces you will be amazed at yourself.

00:28:16.810 --> 00:28:20.850
It is said that you should find out who you are,

00:28:22.150 --> 00:28:27.440
that's not possible unless and until you have your selfrealization.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:31.190
Today in our country we need self realized people

00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:34.850
all kinds of problems can be solved.

00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.890
Every type of,

00:28:38.190 --> 00:28:41.730
I should say, quarrelling is going on.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:45.560
Because you become a collective person,

00:28:46.480 --> 00:28:51.310
you become a personality of a collective nature,

00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:54.980
no more fighting no more is needed. I have many

00:28:55.190 --> 00:28:57.560
Muslim countries who have got realization,

00:28:57.810 --> 00:29:04.520
Turkey, this Benin, there is another one called as Ivory Coast.

00:29:04.730 --> 00:29:07.440
There are seven countries that side,

00:29:07.650 --> 00:29:10.270
they are all Muslims converted,

00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:14.150
or rather transformed into Sahaja Yoga.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:18.310
In this all the integration of all the religions take place,

00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.480
understanding of the

00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:26.060
human abilities,

00:29:26.440 --> 00:29:29.890
human personality and respect.

00:29:30.060 --> 00:29:34.600
I mean it's a very different atmosphere into which you get,

00:29:35.270 --> 00:29:39.400
it's a very different level of awareness, as you were saying,

00:29:39.650 --> 00:29:44.690
where you become so peaceful, silent,

00:29:44.940 --> 00:29:48.310
yet so sweet.

00:29:48.890 --> 00:29:50.600
So I don't know in this short lecture

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.020
how much can I tell you about Sahaja Yoga

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:56.560
bur it is a very miraculous thing.

00:29:56.770 --> 00:30:00.150
And please try to get your self realization,

00:30:00.400 --> 00:30:06.920
he has Me, I think, I will try if I can do that.
