WEBVTT

00:12.020 --> 00:16.400
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:19.400 --> 00:23.890
Speaking before the doctors,

00:24.560 --> 00:26.520
I think of My college days,

00:26.730 --> 00:29.560
while I was also studying medicine

00:29.810 --> 00:36.600
but luckily or unluckily our college stopped completely,

00:38.150 --> 00:41.730
in Lahore and I had to give up My studies.

00:43.560 --> 00:49.230
Not that I had no faith in this western education of medicine

00:49.650 --> 00:54.650
but it was a good chance by connecting this to that

00:54.980 --> 01:01.940
and understanding what is missing in the western medical education.

01:06.270 --> 01:12.190
The missing point is this,

01:12.890 --> 01:19.810
that human beings are considered in the medical science

01:20.100 --> 01:23.150
as something very individual

01:23.400 --> 01:26.890
and not connected with the whole.

01:27.310 --> 01:30.350
We are all connected with the whole.

01:30.690 --> 01:33.440
But how to convince people

01:33.690 --> 01:36.850
that you are all connected with the whole

01:39.520 --> 01:45.560
and that you are not singled out?

01:46.020 --> 01:49.440
As we are connected with the whole

01:49.690 --> 01:54.650
all our problems are connected with the whole.

01:55.060 --> 02:00.060
You cannot just consider somebody as the patient of one thing

02:00.310 --> 02:03.480
and another patient of another thing,

02:03.890 --> 02:08.310
could be that one person who has one trouble,

02:08.560 --> 02:12.020
could be having so many other troubles,

02:12.400 --> 02:14.480
so many other connections

02:14.730 --> 02:20.150
which we do not locate in the western medical sience.

02:21.480 --> 02:28.020
For example, to see a person

02:28.560 --> 02:33.770
medically very sick, may be,

02:34.150 --> 02:37.890
but you don't know, what is his mental condition?

02:38.190 --> 02:40.150
What is he doing mentally?

02:40.400 --> 02:42.150
Is he all right mentally

02:42.350 --> 02:48.850
or only he is physically something wrong with him?

02:49.600 --> 02:55.230
Now absolutely we know about so many things, like say,

02:58.520 --> 03:01.980
medically we have names for that,

03:02.230 --> 03:06.520
that this is a psychosomatic problem

03:06.770 --> 03:10.480
or this is a somatic problem,

03:10.730 --> 03:16.520
but what is the relationship between the two that we don't know.

03:17.020 --> 03:23.270
You'll be amazed most of our diseases come from psychosomatic,

03:23.890 --> 03:29.520
like cancer, which are incurable mostly, cancer

03:29.770 --> 03:33.270
and we can say AIDS,

03:34.020 --> 03:39.520
all such which are supposed to be absolutely incurable

03:40.020 --> 03:41.650
and difficult,

03:41.850 --> 03:46.310
all that come with our connection, with our connection,

03:46.600 --> 03:48.150
which we are not sure of,

03:48.400 --> 03:52.690
with the left side. As we, you have seen here  in picture, left side,

03:52.900 --> 03:55.060
I don't know.

03:55.560 --> 03:58.730
We know only the right side medical science

03:58.940 --> 04:02.310
and that too in such details,

04:03.770 --> 04:06.600
it is not necessary,

04:08.150 --> 04:12.560
you must also know the left side of a human being

04:12.850 --> 04:17.940
and about left side we are absolutely not aware.

04:19.060 --> 04:24.560
For example, a person who is mad,

04:25.400 --> 04:29.730
lunatic, he is in the lunatic asylum.

04:31.980 --> 04:35.770
He doesn't get heart trouble, why?

04:41.520 --> 04:47.770
How has he got mad? What is his connection

04:48.230 --> 04:51.520
with ourselves?

04:52.100 --> 04:57.730
For example, you take a patient

04:57.940 --> 05:01.060
who is suffering, say, from cancer.

05:02.730 --> 05:06.270
We know a lot about cancer, no doubt,

05:06.650 --> 05:11.020
how virus is started and all that, that we know.

05:11.270 --> 05:14.940
But how cancer is caused no one knows

05:15.150 --> 05:19.730
and to what type of people cancer comes in, you don't know.

05:20.940 --> 05:27.940
Now these are two, as you see, there are two channels within us,

05:28.310 --> 05:33.400
one looks after the right side and one looks after the left side.

05:33.850 --> 05:38.190
Now if you have a problem in the left side

05:38.480 --> 05:45.480
then problems psychosomatic can come in.

05:46.060 --> 05:50.100
Supposing, your hand is broken or

05:50.310 --> 05:55.850
is there some sort of a physical problem then it's all right.

05:56.060 --> 06:00.690
But when it is the complicated psychosomatic trouble

06:00.940 --> 06:04.190
then doctors cannot cure it, I am sorry to say.

06:04.440 --> 06:08.980
Because you don't know the other side of side of it,

06:09.310 --> 06:15.440
what is affecting the patient to get this cancer, you don't know.

06:16.890 --> 06:20.350
You will be happy to know in Sahaja Yoga

06:21.270 --> 06:24.400
cancer is curable,

06:25.810 --> 06:28.270
curable if it is at a very early stage

06:28.520 --> 06:32.060
it's very easy but otherwise also.

06:32.520 --> 06:35.650
Specially blood cancer

06:36.600 --> 06:40.270
is absolutely curable.

06:40.770 --> 06:44.600
You will be amazed that it is

06:44.850 --> 06:50.980
such a combination of these two sides of our life,

06:51.270 --> 06:55.440
that we get into these diseases which are incurable.

06:55.690 --> 06:58.730
There is a big list of these incurable diseases

06:58.900 --> 07:00.560
which I don't want to tell you

07:00.850 --> 07:02.850
which you know very well.

07:03.020 --> 07:08.440
So in all of them there is a complication of the left side.

07:08.850 --> 07:11.480
Of course you know about right side very much,

07:11.730 --> 07:16.600
Gray's anatomy and after that all you know, but

07:16.890 --> 07:21.810
you don't know how you get affected by the left side.

07:22.520 --> 07:28.150
So in this lecture, I would like to tell you something about the left side,

07:28.440 --> 07:34.650
which you have never heard of maybe, and you don't believe into.

07:35.350 --> 07:40.020
The left side belongs to our past,

07:40.730 --> 07:45.020
to our past in the sense that

07:45.730 --> 07:51.850
those people who are futuristic do not get affected by left side,

07:52.230 --> 07:54.890
but those people who live in the left side,

07:55.150 --> 07:56.980
are worried about their left side,

07:57.190 --> 08:00.890
are sorry for themselves, whatever it is,

08:01.270 --> 08:05.100
they are the ones who get affected.

08:07.520 --> 08:12.230
Left sided person if I tell you, you will be shocked to hear,

08:12.440 --> 08:15.900
is actually possessed.

08:16.150 --> 08:22.350
Possessed by some dead spirit which must be a knowledge to you.

08:22.600 --> 08:26.480
You may not be believing in it but it is.

08:27.850 --> 08:32.770
It can happen to anyone who gets

08:33.020 --> 08:39.020
sad or gets into the left sided temperament,

08:39.600 --> 08:44.480
Also there are so many other things like these false gurus,

08:44.730 --> 08:47.400
what they do, they mesmerize,

08:47.690 --> 08:49.520
mesmerize you with

08:49.770 --> 08:52.980
dead  spirits which they have to control.

08:53.310 --> 08:55.690
This side

08:56.270 --> 08:59.730
of, I should say, not medicine non-medicine,

08:59.940 --> 09:04.350
but whatever it is, should be known to the doctors;

09:04.650 --> 09:08.690
otherwise you cannot do any curing.

09:09.020 --> 09:11.850
You can, maybe, diagnosis you might do.

09:12.060 --> 09:14.190
But you cannot cure people

09:14.400 --> 09:17.690
who are suffering from psychosomatic troubles.

09:17.900 --> 09:21.310
Today's medical problem is that

09:21.560 --> 09:27.770
they cannot cure psychosomatic diseases.

09:28.150 --> 09:29.940
For that you don't have to spend so many years,

09:30.190 --> 09:32.480
as we do for MBBS.

09:32.690 --> 09:37.480
It's a very, very short course, if you can do that.

09:38.060 --> 09:43.940
Firstly, you should be connected to the divine force,

09:44.270 --> 09:48.440
that's very important, that's not difficult at all,

09:48.690 --> 09:55.690
but after that you have to maintain your spiritual abilities.

09:56.600 --> 10:00.980
One of the spiritual ability is innocence,

10:01.690 --> 10:05.270
the first chakra that you see

10:05.770 --> 10:08.850
is innocence.

10:09.650 --> 10:11.900
If you are a innocent person,

10:12.150 --> 10:17.690
you can easily cure all such people who are suffering

10:17.900 --> 10:21.890
from such incurable diseases.

10:23.600 --> 10:28.900
I would say that one should first of all

10:29.230 --> 10:33.100
try to get self realization, that's important.

10:33.350 --> 10:37.810
When the Kundalini rises, She pierces through your fontanel bone area

10:38.020 --> 10:42.310
and you are connected with the divine force which is all over.

10:42.650 --> 10:47.560
You need not believe Me, but you get your selfrealization

10:47.850 --> 10:50.730
If you have your self realization,

10:50.940 --> 10:53.560
then you will be capable to understand

10:53.770 --> 10:59.810
what sort of combination your patient has.

11:00.810 --> 11:03.350
Is he only physically suffering

11:03.600 --> 11:08.980
or he has this combination of left side?

11:11.350 --> 11:15.690
The other day I was surprised, a child came to Me,

11:15.980 --> 11:19.850
he was suffering from meningitis.

11:20.810 --> 11:22.810
He got cured

11:24.150 --> 11:29.150
and the parents didn't understand how did he get cured.

11:29.560 --> 11:32.940
Then when the boy got cured I asked him:

11:33.400 --> 11:35.810
"Who is your friend?"

11:36.310 --> 11:41.520
He said, this particular boy, who has a particular guru.

11:41.810 --> 11:43.020
All right.

11:43.270 --> 11:45.770
And I go in his house

11:45.980 --> 11:50.940
and go on watching that guru all the time, can you imagine?

11:52.310 --> 11:55.190
There are many doctors also

11:55.520 --> 11:59.520
who get involved with these bad gurus.

11:59.940 --> 12:04.270
You must know, unless and until you are realized,

12:04.600 --> 12:11.520
you will not know who is truthful and who is correct.

12:12.650 --> 12:16.060
An innocent boy suffering from meningitis

12:16.270 --> 12:19.600
and overnight he got cured.

12:20.770 --> 12:23.480
You'll be amazed at

12:25.560 --> 12:29.560
the great experience of Sahaja Yoga

12:29.890 --> 12:33.350
and it is too great a surprise,

12:33.600 --> 12:36.230
that's why people don't accept it.

12:36.480 --> 12:40.190
But we have many cases by which we can show,

12:40.440 --> 12:45.270
that people who were supposed to be incurable are cured.

12:48.230 --> 12:54.850
So many people, especially with serious diseases, like cancer.

12:55.890 --> 12:58.520
I mean in the medical science for cancer,

12:58.730 --> 13:00.890
they will go on like this, like that,

13:01.100 --> 13:04.150
till they shave you off completely.

13:05.060 --> 13:06.890
But not in Sahaja Yoga,

13:07.100 --> 13:11.150
immediately you will know that this man is possessed.

13:11.440 --> 13:15.770
Now this line to Medical Science is absolutely not there,

13:15.980 --> 13:19.810
but in our country we always believed in that.

13:20.230 --> 13:22.480
We have certain rules and regulations

13:22.730 --> 13:26.480
about people who are dead. How to behave?

13:26.730 --> 13:29.440
How to go to Shamshan (MEANS Cremation ground)

13:29.690 --> 13:34.650
and all that. There is a particular type of

13:35.600 --> 13:38.100
understanding

13:38.650 --> 13:42.730
of all these dead bodies,

13:42.980 --> 13:45.060
how they behave, Where do they go?

13:45.310 --> 13:48.850
And is I think a very big part

13:49.060 --> 13:53.190
of your knowledge, very big part.

13:53.440 --> 13:57.690
So many diseases, incurable, you cannot cure,

13:57.900 --> 14:01.150
which are mostly coming from the left side.

14:01.400 --> 14:03.850
Medical science can cure the right side.

14:04.060 --> 14:06.600
I know that, that they can do it.

14:06.890 --> 14:11.020
But cancer they will go on postponing from one to another,

14:11.270 --> 14:16.150
they'll operate, then it will spread, this and that.

14:16.440 --> 14:21.190
Operation is not the way to cure, it's not.

14:21.850 --> 14:27.190
If you are expert  in Sahaja Yoga, you don't have to operate.

14:27.480 --> 14:31.310
Overnight you can cure, overnight you can cure

14:31.560 --> 14:33.560
cancer patient, believe Me.

14:33.770 --> 14:37.560
You are quite capable of doing that. Especially Indians,

14:37.850 --> 14:41.310
because Indians have a special capacity.

14:41.560 --> 14:46.350
I should say what special blessing of this country.

14:46.600 --> 14:50.400
We don't know this country how great it is,

14:50.690 --> 14:55.060
but we are only dealing with the western education,

14:55.440 --> 15:00.730
where have they reached, these western people in their experiments,

15:00.940 --> 15:02.890
I just don't understand.

15:03.100 --> 15:06.100
Their children are taking to drugs,

15:06.690 --> 15:09.400
their families are disturbed,

15:09.650 --> 15:12.230
everything is so upset.

15:12.440 --> 15:16.650
Not that I decry this education, not at all.

15:16.890 --> 15:19.890
But it is not complete

15:20.150 --> 15:23.150
and you should have the other side of it.

15:23.400 --> 15:27.350
Otherwise, don't have a cancer hospital.

15:27.600 --> 15:32.940
Only have physical things

15:33.190 --> 15:35.810
by which you will work it out

15:36.020 --> 15:39.060
but if you want to have

15:39.350 --> 15:42.400
patients of all types,

15:42.770 --> 15:45.730
then you must know the other side.

15:45.940 --> 15:50.440
There is nothing to be frightened, nothing to be upset,

15:50.650 --> 15:54.230
but it's a knowledge which you should have as doctors,

15:54.480 --> 15:59.150
because I think the medical science  is still not complete

15:59.350 --> 16:03.350
that as Doctor Aggarwal himself has said it.

16:03.600 --> 16:09.890
But what is lacking in it, the know- ledge of the left side that we have.

16:11.480 --> 16:13.850
Now if I should say that

16:14.020 --> 16:16.730
I didn't read it in any book,

16:16.940 --> 16:18.980
I didn't get it from any book,

16:19.230 --> 16:21.600
but only when I was

16:21.810 --> 16:26.060
working with Sahaja Yoga, with people, I discovered

16:26.520 --> 16:28.730
that compared to India, western people

16:28.940 --> 16:32.350
are much more affected by the left side, much more.

16:34.230 --> 16:37.940
much more. And they cannot understand

16:38.150 --> 16:42.890
how they are sick, what has happened to them.

16:43.190 --> 16:48.150
Even if you take a very limited area of treatment

16:48.440 --> 16:52.350
of a human welfare

16:52.770 --> 16:58.520
then is a very important part is the left side

16:59.100 --> 17:02.230
Supposing a lady who is all the time crying

17:02.480 --> 17:05.690
and weeping and unhappy,

17:05.940 --> 17:08.890
she can get cancer.

17:12.190 --> 17:14.310
Now there are two types,

17:14.560 --> 17:16.940
one also right sided diseases,

17:17.230 --> 17:19.520
one is of course the left side.

17:19.730 --> 17:21.850
In the right sided people,

17:22.020 --> 17:26.270
who are extremely, I should say, aggressive,

17:26.560 --> 17:31.440
extremely overpowering, controlling type,

17:31.650 --> 17:34.810
of course they have a very bad liver, I must say.

17:35.060 --> 17:37.890
They have a very bad liver

17:38.100 --> 17:44.270
and when they get like that they cross all the limits

17:44.730 --> 17:47.060
and when they cross all the limits

17:47.310 --> 17:53.480
they get such diseases which you cannot find out, you cannot cure.

17:54.890 --> 17:58.190
One of them is the disease of the liver,

17:58.480 --> 18:02.890
I think doctors can't cure liver. They may try,

18:03.150 --> 18:08.190
but can't cure liver as Sahaja Yoga can cure.

18:10.020 --> 18:13.690
And such a person  whose temperament, he's so hot tempered

18:13.940 --> 18:17.480
and he's  so aggressive and this and that,

18:17.900 --> 18:23.810
he suffers from that horrible liver

18:24.060 --> 18:28.310
and develops all kinds of complications.

18:30.810 --> 18:32.770
There are so many other diseases also

18:32.940 --> 18:35.520
on the right side, so many other.

18:35.770 --> 18:39.810
But mainly I think is a disease of the liver.

18:39.980 --> 18:42.980
Liver is lived with.

18:43.350 --> 18:48.600
And if your liver is out, there is no solution in the allopathy.

18:48.810 --> 18:52.770
May be little bit here and little bit there.

18:53.810 --> 18:56.600
But at the climax of it,

18:56.940 --> 19:02.560
with the liver one can fade, one can even die.

19:05.900 --> 19:10.020
In the West, liver problem is very common

19:11.980 --> 19:16.060
and there is no solution for them for that.

19:16.980 --> 19:18.810
They go on living with it

19:18.980 --> 19:23.980
and doctors just admit them in the hospital.

19:25.810 --> 19:29.230
These are not incurable, they are absolutely curable.

19:29.480 --> 19:32.850
Because we haven't got that knowledge

19:33.100 --> 19:39.770
and that's why we call them incurable. No, they're not.

19:40.650 --> 19:43.060
I do not want to blame other diseases,

19:43.310 --> 19:48.890
but there are so many of them, which cannot be even diagnosed

19:49.100 --> 19:53.270
and which cannot be cured by the medical science.

19:53.560 --> 19:56.690
Which we must accept first of all,

19:56.940 --> 19:59.020
that that is the situation.

19:59.270 --> 20:03.520
We may go on trying doing anything

20:03.770 --> 20:05.650
but we cannot cure.

20:05.890 --> 20:10.020
So many types of medicines will come out, we cannot cure.

20:10.350 --> 20:12.650
Because what I am trying to tell you

20:12.850 --> 20:14.310
that's only half part

20:14.520 --> 20:19.270
of your being is discussed.

20:19.600 --> 20:23.600
In that also so many things are not there.

20:23.890 --> 20:26.650
Take it for example asthma,

20:26.890 --> 20:31.310
asthma cannot be cured by doctors, is a fact

20:31.650 --> 20:35.890
but Sahaja Yoga can absolutely cure

20:36.190 --> 20:39.480
Allergies also can be cured by us.

20:39.730 --> 20:44.270
Because if you have the roots of all the troubles,

20:44.600 --> 20:46.890
if you know about the roots,

20:47.100 --> 20:50.730
not pharmaceutical and all that but real roots,

20:50.940 --> 20:55.190
then you  can handle the situation and you can cure.

20:55.480 --> 21:00.560
We haven't got any yet a college or anything so far in Sahaja Yoga.

21:00.810 --> 21:05.150
I wish we could. But hospital we have.

21:05.480 --> 21:10.600
We have a hospital in Belapur, they call it

21:11.150 --> 21:15.520
New Bombay, where they are treating people.

21:15.770 --> 21:18.480
Only they have to pay for their stay

21:18.730 --> 21:22.690
and it's hardly I think 300 rupees per day

21:22.890 --> 21:28.900
for poor people. But you don't need any medicine,

21:29.270 --> 21:31.850
you don't have to pay for anything.

21:32.060 --> 21:34.890
For our country which is so poor,

21:35.150 --> 21:37.690
don't you think, it's very important?

21:37.940 --> 21:41.270
Otherwise you go for X-ray,

21:41.520 --> 21:44.890
then you go for another test,

21:45.100 --> 21:50.100
then for another test and nothing comes out of it.

21:51.890 --> 21:57.190
One should only know how to deal with it.

21:58.900 --> 22:03.400
Now supposing somebody's leg is broken - finished,

22:03.650 --> 22:09.100
cut his leg, put another leg. No need,

22:09.650 --> 22:12.850
I assure you there is no need.

22:13.480 --> 22:18.440
Now we have some doctors in Sahaja Yoga, very good.

22:18.730 --> 22:22.230
Some of them are in America, some of them are in Italy

22:22.520 --> 22:25.730
and some of them are in Russia.

22:25.940 --> 22:27.890
Russian doctors are very good.

22:28.100 --> 22:30.440
I don't know how they think

22:30.650 --> 22:33.850
that there is something beyond this education

22:34.100 --> 22:36.730
and they are trying to learn it.

22:37.520 --> 22:39.730
If you can make any facility,

22:39.940 --> 22:42.150
I will be very happy but in any case

22:42.350 --> 22:44.350
I am thinking of starting

22:44.560 --> 22:48.810
a Sahaja Yoga hospital in your country

22:49.020 --> 22:51.480
specially in Delhi,

22:51.810 --> 22:54.350
in Greater Noida

22:56.100 --> 23:00.810
and if some of your doctors can join us

23:01.020 --> 23:03.520
help us a lot.

23:03.940 --> 23:08.150
In Greater Noida I am thinking of starting

23:08.400 --> 23:11.560
a college or we can call it a school

23:11.810 --> 23:15.980
we'll get the students as well as doctors

23:16.230 --> 23:20.890
who can cure people. And there will be...

23:22.350 --> 23:24.690
And there will be no charges for treatment.

23:24.890 --> 23:28.400
Of course, where they stay, if they come and stay there

23:28.650 --> 23:31.770
then they might have to pay for  their food, that's all.

23:32.060 --> 23:34.850
Otherwise this is an arrangement I am having

23:35.060 --> 23:39.770
and anybody who wants to join as a doctor, also

23:40.020 --> 23:43.730
we'll like to accept their services.

23:44.270 --> 23:48.020
How much will be the pay I don't now, but not much I would say,

23:48.270 --> 23:52.890
we'll pay about 6000 to 7000 per month to a doctor.

23:53.190 --> 23:54.980
But he has to be a Sahaja yogi

23:55.230 --> 23:58.600
and he should know the method of Sahaja Yoga.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.900
I think, it is one of

24:02.400 --> 24:06.060
the very generous feeling

24:06.350 --> 24:09.770
that in our country so many die

24:09.940 --> 24:14.400
because they cannot get into the hospital, they cannot get treated.

24:15.940 --> 24:21.560
If you can give some time to this project of Mine,

24:21.810 --> 24:27.520
I am sure I'll be able to organize a good hospital

24:27.810 --> 24:31.060
for those people. In that we'll have

24:31.310 --> 24:35.020
somatic patients as well as psychosomatic patients

24:35.440 --> 24:37.810
all kinds of patients we'll have.

24:38.020 --> 24:40.730
And you will learn so much

24:40.900 --> 24:45.150
because it's a very subtle and deep knowledge.

24:45.350 --> 24:50.890
Just cannot learn it on the book, you have to have experiment

24:51.060 --> 24:54.270
with the patient. You will be amazed,

24:54.480 --> 24:56.690
how you will be curing people.

24:56.890 --> 25:01.520
It´s not book of knowledge, it's a very, very practical knowledge

25:01.770 --> 25:07.810
and those who have that charitable temperament

25:08.020 --> 25:11.150
can do very well and learn a lot.

25:11.400 --> 25:13.890
One thing I must tell you

25:14.060 --> 25:17.600
Sahaja Yoga has one bad point also,

25:17.850 --> 25:22.150
that you cannot make money, you cannot.

25:22.400 --> 25:26.190
If you try making money out of it, you fail.

25:26.480 --> 25:30.980
Some or other this money business is little higher

25:31.190 --> 25:34.730
for Sahaja Yogis, they cannot manage with it.

25:35.060 --> 25:38.100
But you can give service.

25:38.560 --> 25:45.600
Now we had a very nice retired doctor in this Belapur hospital

25:45.890 --> 25:48.060
and he did very well,

25:48.270 --> 25:51.270
now he is no more. He worked very hard

25:51.480 --> 25:55.270
but his daughter in law is now looking after that.

25:56.270 --> 25:59.770
If you want, if you are retired people,

25:59.980 --> 26:02.270
if you are not in need of money

26:02.480 --> 26:06.770
much money then it's a very good thing.

26:07.600 --> 26:13.100
Also we provide, say, a residence,

26:13.480 --> 26:18.270
food, everything, can be managed, it's not so difficult,

26:18.480 --> 26:22.350
but it's not a very money oriented

26:22.650 --> 26:26.350
I must say since I was studying medical,

26:26.600 --> 26:31.520
now medical line has become very money oriented,

26:31.730 --> 26:34.150
I am surprised. I am sorry to say,

26:34.350 --> 26:36.480
but they have become very money oriented

26:36.650 --> 26:39.190
and some of your doctors have gone to America

26:39.400 --> 26:42.060
and have befooled people so much

26:42.270 --> 26:46.600
and have made so much money that you feel ashamed to be an Indian,

26:46.810 --> 26:47.650
it's like that.

26:47.850 --> 26:49.480
You can't make much money

26:49.690 --> 26:53.980
but as retired people you can join us and help us

26:54.230 --> 26:57.230
and some of you can come to learn Sahaja Yoga.

26:57.480 --> 27:01.350
Hardly within say months time you will be experts.

27:01.600 --> 27:05.730
You can diagnose the thing without any delay.

27:05.940 --> 27:09.100
You don't have to go to any laboratory or anything,

27:09.350 --> 27:12.440
immediately you will know what's the trouble.

27:12.690 --> 27:17.100
And all sorts of incurable diseases you can try.

27:17.350 --> 27:23.270
I am amazed Myself as to how it is working with people.

27:24.270 --> 27:26.940
Now all these awards and all that they have given Me

27:27.190 --> 27:30.060
because I have cured people and done that

27:30.270 --> 27:32.810
but I don't have a hospital there.

27:32.980 --> 27:37.940
First hospital I want to have in Delhi and here I want to work it out.

27:38.150 --> 27:42.810
Let us think of working it out ourselves.

27:42.980 --> 27:48.520
It's a charitable hospital and it's very sensible,

27:48.690 --> 27:51.520
I have already got money to build,

27:51.730 --> 27:56.480
but only thing I need some doctors who can help Me,

27:56.730 --> 27:58.770
it´s a very stunning thing Sahaja Yoga,

27:58.940 --> 28:01.730
if you come you will be amazed how it works.

28:01.900 --> 28:03.310
I know

28:03.650 --> 28:07.100
never been that, we have never been connected to the divine.

28:07.400 --> 28:10.190
We have never used that forces of the divine

28:10.440 --> 28:16.060
and once you start using those forces you will be amazed at yourself.

28:16.810 --> 28:20.850
It is said that you should find out who you are,

28:22.150 --> 28:27.440
that's not possible unless and until you have your selfrealization.

28:27.690 --> 28:31.190
Today in our country we need self realized people

28:31.440 --> 28:34.850
all kinds of problems can be solved.

28:35.060 --> 28:37.890
Every type of,

28:38.190 --> 28:41.730
I should say, quarrelling is going on.

28:41.900 --> 28:45.560
Because you become a collective person,

28:46.480 --> 28:51.310
you become a personality of a collective nature,

28:51.520 --> 28:54.980
no more fighting no more is needed. I have many

28:55.190 --> 28:57.560
Muslim countries who have got realization,

28:57.810 --> 29:04.520
Turkey, this Benin, there is another one called as Ivory Coast.

29:04.730 --> 29:07.440
There are seven countries that side,

29:07.650 --> 29:10.270
they are all Muslims converted,

29:10.520 --> 29:14.150
or rather transformed into Sahaja Yoga.

29:14.400 --> 29:18.310
In this all the integration of all the religions take place,

29:18.600 --> 29:21.480
understanding of the

29:21.690 --> 29:26.060
human abilities,

29:26.440 --> 29:29.890
human personality and respect.

29:30.060 --> 29:34.600
I mean it's a very different atmosphere into which you get,

29:35.270 --> 29:39.400
it's a very different level of awareness, as you were saying,

29:39.650 --> 29:44.690
where you become so peaceful, silent,

29:44.940 --> 29:48.310
yet so sweet.

29:48.890 --> 29:50.600
So I don't know in this short lecture

29:50.890 --> 29:53.020
how much can I tell you about Sahaja Yoga

29:53.270 --> 29:56.560
bur it is a very miraculous thing.

29:56.770 --> 30:00.150
And please try to get your self realization,

30:00.400 --> 30:06.920
he has Me, I think, I will try if I can do that.
