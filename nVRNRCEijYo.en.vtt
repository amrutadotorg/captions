[Music]

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.120
so I have to request you people first

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.640
and foremost thing all the sahaja

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.500
yoginis must know sahaja yoga as well as

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.449
the men know not just smiling and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.760
dressing up is important in sahaja yoga

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:58.269
you must have the same knowledge as any

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.829
sahaja yogi has if you have produced

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.149
children it doesn't mean that you have

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:06.580
achieved something that anybody can

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:08.619
produce children dogs cats everyone also

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.000
your husbands are responsible partly for

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:14.649
it so nothing you have achieved made by

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.119
producing children looking after the

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:20.380
children dominating your husband all the

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:22.270
time how much do you know about sahaja

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:26.710
yoga I know some of them do not know

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.450
what are the chakras on the feet they

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.159
don't want to know anything about sahaja

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.850
yoga only they want to use sahaja yoga

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.069
sometimes to dominate transmits one has

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:43.090
to face it up how much do you know

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:45.280

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.560
many problems within yourselves as I

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.959

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:58.860
regular booth in you and I have seen

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:02.860
people saying that they're sensitive

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.810
it's such a misleading thing I am very

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.300
sensitive I am very much higher in

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:09.280
sahaja yoga that's not the way you are

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:13.140
going to be high you have to be

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.640
absolutely perfect in perfect health and

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:18.700
perfect knowledge about sahaja yoga you

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:33.430
full Advent alright that's good

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.819
how many English girls have read

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:47.079
advented honestly honestly that's good

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:54.099
now what I'm trying to say that you have

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:58.480
to find out what is sahaja yoga your

00:02:54.099 --> 00:03:02.200
guru is a woman she is the source of all

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.139
the knowledge she is the ocean of all

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:07.560
the knowledge and why she relaxed behind

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:10.810
in all things you want to be absolutely

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.780
equal similar to men even in dressing up

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:19.599
and everything and what about in

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.699
knowledge about sahaja yoga how many

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.829
have give realizations to others raise

00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:28.840
your hands

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:34.199
only the women I am interested in it's

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:37.359
good so that is what one should be proud

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:43.900
one should know how much you know sahaja

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:48.280
yoga mentally emotionally how many of

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:51.060
you dominate your husband be careful

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:55.509
she's the only honest person I think I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:59.709
know all of you who dominate and try to

00:03:55.509 --> 00:04:02.169
crush them all so sometimes I am

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.650
requesting you now because you are the

00:04:02.169 --> 00:04:07.030
Shakti you are the power behind the man

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:12.040
you are the one who are going to make

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:14.379
them great you are the one who are going

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.949
to build up sahaja yoga as a potential

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:20.139
energy you are like this mother earth

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:22.150
who has to give everything beautiful all

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.270
these flowers from where do they come

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:30.099
all these trees this mother earth look

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.580
so simple but what she gives us look at

00:04:30.099 --> 00:04:37.510
that

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:40.900
look at those beautiful things so

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.030
one has to understand that to be a good

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:46.690
sahaja yogini first of all you have to

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.760
be an excellent wife and not a

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.820
dominating wife pushing yourself forward

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.850
all the time

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:57.670
now the deep problem I find is the women

00:04:54.850 --> 00:05:01.210
who are supposed to be my disciples will

00:04:57.670 --> 00:05:03.990
be spoiling sahaja yoga very clearly I

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.350
can see it now I can see it so clearly

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:09.820
absolutely clearly they are going to

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.780
spoil because they have become very

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:16.960
dominating because they think they know

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:20.290
sahaja yoga because they think they have

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.950
become very great and leaders wife

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:26.200
thinks she is the leader herself if you

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:28.120
call somebody that all right come and do

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:29.890
this module for me the wife thinks she

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:35.710
has a right on her husband more than

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:38.080
mother has is the women who are the

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:38.960
culprit today and that's why I want to

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:55.920
one

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:59.440
[Music]

00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:00.910
growl lakshmi is the woman who should

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:04.390
know that she has the great

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:09.340
responsibility of creating a very great

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:12.790
society of sahaja yoga she's not an

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:18.820
ordinary woman how we how many women

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:20.710
what their realization before but in

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:24.970
sahaja yoga I should find the ladies

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:29.530
we hardly find very few who are really

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:35.970
alert most of them are in trance

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:35.970
condition they don't know anything

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.780
they don't know anything they don't know

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:48.440
much of cooking you asked have anything

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:55.220
they don't know anything you talk to

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:57.090
them you feel as if they have taken some

00:06:55.220 --> 00:07:01.770
sort of a drug

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:04.110
nothing goes into their necks sometimes

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:07.040
one fits it's better I do it myself

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:07.040
impossible

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:18.239
the alertness is gone because alertness

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:22.699
that comes through your right side is

00:07:18.239 --> 00:07:22.699
wasted on nonsensical things

00:07:23.269 --> 00:07:31.559
attention is wasted on nonsensical

00:07:27.659 --> 00:07:36.360
things that's why the housewives have

00:07:31.559 --> 00:07:40.499
lost that discretion to know that they

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:42.769
have to be extremely alert and sensible

00:07:40.499 --> 00:07:42.769
and wise

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:48.079
[Music]

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:53.560
they should know each and everything

00:07:55.570 --> 00:08:02.330
it's not so they just live in the air

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:04.790
somewhere hanging you know you don't

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:08.720
know what to say to them how to ask for

00:08:04.790 --> 00:08:12.010
anything how to explain anything to

00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:12.010
there was an impossible situation

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:29.610
so that alertness has to be there in a

00:08:23.970 --> 00:08:35.219
housewife is an extremely important but

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:38.880
if you do not have the alertness then

00:08:35.219 --> 00:08:43.320
you cannot be a girl Lakshmi you cannot

00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.620
be a good mother you cannot be a good

00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:45.620
wife

00:08:48.079 --> 00:09:03.870
there's no slavery in it they don't know

00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:09.980
even what pleases their husbands how to

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:13.579
create peace in the family what to say

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.579
when to say

00:09:15.370 --> 00:09:26.200
beautiful things and when to restrict

00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:31.990
all this discretion is not there either

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:31.990
they are shrews or their slaves

00:09:39.589 --> 00:09:48.399
so sahaja Yoga is meant for women who

00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:54.110
are alert who are wise who know

00:09:48.399 --> 00:09:56.379
everything about life even they don't

00:09:54.110 --> 00:10:00.860
know where are the chakras on the feet

00:09:56.379 --> 00:10:06.589
look at your mother she's a woman she

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:14.360
knows so much they don't know anything

00:10:06.589 --> 00:10:18.769
as to how Kundalini passes through these

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:21.410
centers what it does what she is capable

00:10:18.769 --> 00:10:22.399
of but the Kundalini itself is the

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:28.720
feminine power

00:10:22.399 --> 00:10:35.029
she knows each and everything about you

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:37.670
about her child many mothers don't know

00:10:35.029 --> 00:10:43.029
if the child is taking drugs or is

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:48.040
behaving which way except for spoiling

00:10:43.029 --> 00:10:48.040
or beating there's nothing in between

00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:54.610
with discretion

00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:05.740
the mothers can make these special

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:11.000
children a do something

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:13.790
that is my vision about them but with

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.690
their indiscretion they can go in these

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:16.690
children completely

00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:24.180
this is

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:38.580
so important that our hamsa should be

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:43.020
alright that we should be able to create

00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:46.260
a beautiful home a peaceful home not

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.790
only for our family but for all the

00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:50.000
other sahaja Yogi's who come to our

00:11:47.790 --> 00:11:50.000
house

00:11:50.900 --> 00:11:57.580
[Music]

00:12:04.819 --> 00:12:15.799
I have noticed of course I'm as a woman

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:20.689
that women have certain water powers of

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:23.689
crying weeping and thinking they are

00:12:20.689 --> 00:12:27.979
very miserable and making everybody

00:12:23.689 --> 00:12:32.139
miserable this is their power so inside

00:12:27.979 --> 00:12:37.359
every woman there is a motherhood

00:12:32.139 --> 00:12:42.109
there's great capacities sacrifice

00:12:37.359 --> 00:12:48.259
everything is there with that they also

00:12:42.109 --> 00:12:56.350
should know they're left-sided and our

00:12:48.259 --> 00:12:56.350
joy about which we talk within our heart

00:12:57.069 --> 00:13:04.609
has to manifest outside people should

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:08.419
see that we are joyous that we are happy

00:13:04.609 --> 00:13:13.189
people that we are not like others who

00:13:08.419 --> 00:13:16.009
start crying for small things like when

00:13:13.189 --> 00:13:18.499
my father died I was surprised that

00:13:16.009 --> 00:13:21.289
suddenly I became thoughtless absolutely

00:13:18.499 --> 00:13:24.559
thoughtless for about three days I were

00:13:21.289 --> 00:13:27.229
thoughtless neither the thought of pain

00:13:24.559 --> 00:13:34.159
or thought of unhappiness or anything

00:13:27.229 --> 00:13:38.179
came up but just thoughtless and

00:13:34.159 --> 00:13:39.949
everybody was surprised because I looked

00:13:38.179 --> 00:13:42.799
after him and I mean he was very

00:13:39.949 --> 00:13:44.479
attached to me very fond of me

00:13:42.799 --> 00:13:46.189
everything was there but they were

00:13:44.479 --> 00:13:46.669
surprised how is it that we come

00:13:46.189 --> 00:13:50.209
suddenly

00:13:46.669 --> 00:13:53.749
thoughtless so if you are a sahaja

00:13:50.209 --> 00:13:55.399
yogini then at the time of crisis you

00:13:53.749 --> 00:13:57.559
should become thoughtless that's one of

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:59.569
the sides I have seen with myself if

00:13:57.559 --> 00:14:03.139
there is any crisis in the family I just

00:13:59.569 --> 00:14:10.369
become thoughtless that means what that

00:14:03.139 --> 00:14:13.189
God just takes you in your problems he

00:14:10.369 --> 00:14:16.230
puts his hand he puts his protection and

00:14:13.189 --> 00:14:19.170
he takes you out of it

00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:24.420
and makes you absolutely thoughtless and

00:14:19.170 --> 00:14:30.510
in that thoughtless awareness you

00:14:24.420 --> 00:14:33.990
discover what is right what is wrong so

00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:38.190
even in crisis this thoughtless

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:40.110
awareness is all the time extremely

00:14:38.190 --> 00:14:44.220
alert it becomes much more alert than

00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:47.580
normal that's the sign of a sahaja Yogi

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:51.240
and a sign of sahaja yogini this is

00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:53.640
another kind of ego expression itit is

00:14:51.240 --> 00:14:55.710
crying business so today I want to have

00:14:53.640 --> 00:15:00.480
a promise from all of you that you are

00:14:55.710 --> 00:15:02.870
not going to cry at all instead of

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:07.580
flowers you just give me this flower of

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:12.240
promise I never cry of course sometimes

00:15:07.580 --> 00:15:14.850
Sandra Khanna one tear or two tears

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:19.110
might come out of my after all I am a

00:15:14.850 --> 00:15:22.590
mother but not like this sitting crying

00:15:19.110 --> 00:15:25.830
crying becoming hysterics must have your

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:33.570
dignity you are all sahaja yoginis don't

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:37.130
read any book which talks of crying but

00:15:33.570 --> 00:15:40.760
books which are deep also make you feel

00:15:37.130 --> 00:15:45.060
very much - if you lie crying is alright

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:47.280
in the cinema they say see a woman

00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:49.350
torturing her husband there they will

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:54.870
cry item they'll come and torture the

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:58.670
husband for sins I have seen many like

00:15:54.870 --> 00:16:01.200
that in the Sina they will be crying

00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.180
when it is somebody else they feel the

00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:09.660
pain when it is them says they never see

00:16:03.180 --> 00:16:14.670
what they are doing so my one demand

00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:18.360
today is that you must not cry now you

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:22.310
are in the kingdom of God and in the

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:37.529
kingdom of God you do not try

00:16:22.310 --> 00:16:40.329
[Music]

00:16:37.529 --> 00:16:42.430
now this I would say for the physical

00:16:40.329 --> 00:16:44.769
self that one has to know that you are

00:16:42.430 --> 00:16:46.779
all younger and getting younger and

00:16:44.769 --> 00:16:51.269
younger but not the stupidity of youth

00:16:46.779 --> 00:16:55.389
but gravity the gravity of the age

00:16:51.269 --> 00:16:58.420
actually I have seen children who are

00:16:55.389 --> 00:17:02.459
born realized the very grief they won't

00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:04.839
do anything that is not dignified and

00:17:02.459 --> 00:17:08.500
they will never I have never heard them

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:10.419
talking to some of the sahaja yoginis

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:12.189
have a bad habit of talking tuk tuk tuk

00:17:10.419 --> 00:17:15.130
tuk tuk tuk amalgams is a very bad habit

00:17:12.189 --> 00:17:18.610
it shows that they're still very much

00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:20.110
lucky just wearing saris are wearing

00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:22.659
Mindy's you do not become assertive

00:17:20.110 --> 00:17:24.010
first of all what is the gravity you

00:17:22.659 --> 00:17:24.880
should only speak whenever it is

00:17:24.010 --> 00:17:28.360
necessary

00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:31.000
so this dignity and his understanding

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:33.130
comes only through science but if you

00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:34.840
are chirping all the time talking that

00:17:33.130 --> 00:17:38.740
the tuk tuk tuk tuk doctor

00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:41.140
it can never never can make you deeper

00:17:38.740 --> 00:17:44.710
person you'll be just flying in the air

00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:46.600
we thought so for women now is best to

00:17:44.710 --> 00:17:49.929
take to my own eyes to keep quiet

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:52.179
just people they all the time want to

00:17:49.929 --> 00:17:54.600
talk is I have heard from all the

00:17:52.179 --> 00:17:57.640
leaders that is a big problem with women

00:17:54.600 --> 00:18:00.250
they just want talking stories telling

00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:05.980
story but if you ask them to come and

00:18:00.250 --> 00:18:11.940
speak they will start shaking how many

00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:14.799
can give speeches women if you

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:19.360
understand that if you cannot give a

00:18:14.799 --> 00:18:21.190
speech you better not talk also you

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:22.750
should be able to give a speed because

00:18:21.190 --> 00:18:24.820
your mother is a woman she give speeches

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:27.100
why can't you give some speech you

00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:29.649
cannot if you make new stallion will be

00:18:27.100 --> 00:18:32.919
shaking I know that but if it comes to

00:18:29.649 --> 00:18:34.780
murmuring Souls you are there so that is

00:18:32.919 --> 00:18:37.270
one thing women have to be very careful

00:18:34.780 --> 00:18:39.220
and as today is the guru puja I have to

00:18:37.270 --> 00:18:43.120
tell you things not as a mother but as

00:18:39.220 --> 00:18:46.240
your guru that if you have to ascend the

00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:48.169
best thing is for you to stop talking ma

00:18:46.240 --> 00:18:52.070
Nome serve artha sadhana

00:18:48.169 --> 00:18:55.220
mon means to keep quiet is the it gives

00:18:52.070 --> 00:18:58.190
you all kinds of facilities just keep

00:18:55.220 --> 00:19:01.369
quiet if somebody stopping too much just

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:02.720
keep quiet if somebody's trying to

00:19:01.369 --> 00:19:04.489
criticize keep quiet

00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:07.460
that's your silence that's your right

00:19:04.489 --> 00:19:10.850
that's your domain that you can keep

00:19:07.460 --> 00:19:13.789
silent just watch that person if it

00:19:10.850 --> 00:19:17.239
comes then to answer then you can answer

00:19:13.789 --> 00:19:20.929
it but if somebody is trying to attack

00:19:17.239 --> 00:19:23.389
you just keep silent but this silence

00:19:20.929 --> 00:19:26.210
has to be established and one should

00:19:23.389 --> 00:19:28.489
only establish by not talking too much I

00:19:26.210 --> 00:19:30.139
have seen also when I am sitting here I

00:19:28.489 --> 00:19:33.889
have seen women talking among ourselves

00:19:30.139 --> 00:19:35.480
and this is very wrong you must learn

00:19:33.889 --> 00:19:51.020
the silence

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:53.900
[Music]

00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:58.950
seriously we must think are we

00:19:53.900 --> 00:20:02.160
meditating are we all doing something to

00:19:58.950 --> 00:20:02.850
elevate others also to give realizations

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:05.670
to others

00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:08.730
especially women have seen don't do much

00:20:05.670 --> 00:20:11.309
of this which is very bad because you

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:15.030
are the mothers you have to go all out

00:20:11.309 --> 00:20:17.309
to give realizations to others but men

00:20:15.030 --> 00:20:20.580
are more active that way and women are

00:20:17.309 --> 00:20:24.150
not so it works the other way down now

00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:26.910
on one side the men are I think are

00:20:24.150 --> 00:20:29.790
active but don't meditate you women

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:32.970
meditate and men do the outside work

00:20:29.790 --> 00:20:38.700
sort of way what time or you can call it

00:20:32.970 --> 00:20:41.730
a good labor division that you meditate

00:20:38.700 --> 00:20:45.270
at work and we'll go all out he's not

00:20:41.730 --> 00:20:51.900
going to work out so one has to meditate

00:20:45.270 --> 00:20:55.880
and one has to also go out to spread

00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:58.830
sahaja yoga both things have to be done

00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:02.270
supposing now you meditate and you don't

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:06.419
spread sort of you will never ascend

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:09.120
because after all this Kundalini is he

00:21:06.419 --> 00:21:10.290
she's a sensible woman she's very

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:15.179
sensible

00:21:10.290 --> 00:21:18.900
she thinks why should I make her a saint

00:21:15.179 --> 00:21:22.860
what is the use sahaja Yoga is not

00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:25.230
individualistic it's not for one person

00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:30.090
to be no saint and sit somewhere it's

00:21:25.230 --> 00:21:32.880
not like that it's not meant for one

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.990
person for oneself it's not

00:21:32.880 --> 00:21:38.250
individualistic

00:21:33.990 --> 00:21:42.270
it's a collective happening I must say

00:21:38.250 --> 00:21:44.790
that somehow men have been more dynamic

00:21:42.270 --> 00:21:47.460
have working it out the women in sahaja

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:49.679
yoga are not yet coming up to that level

00:21:47.460 --> 00:21:52.730
as they should they have to be more

00:21:49.679 --> 00:21:55.640
sensible about it and they have to work

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:59.390
they can do it but only trouble is I

00:21:55.640 --> 00:22:02.240
think they have certain minor problems

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:04.970
what which they're very always I get

00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:06.230
letters from ladies saying this is wrong

00:22:04.970 --> 00:22:09.590
that is wrong

00:22:06.230 --> 00:22:11.870
complaining all the time when I am so

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:15.070
fed up of their letters now that I think

00:22:11.870 --> 00:22:18.050
there are useless to read they're also

00:22:15.070 --> 00:22:21.470
so I have to tell you all that it is

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:23.750
important that men because they are

00:22:21.470 --> 00:22:28.810
dynamic women should be much more

00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:28.810
because they are Shakti and I know I

00:22:28.960 --> 00:22:36.260
find that the men are more sort of

00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:37.850
active and dynamic about sahaja yoga and

00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:44.080
I don't know what is the reason why

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:47.600
women are not they can transform so many

00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:51.290
they can do so much good to us they can

00:22:47.600 --> 00:22:54.740
bring so much love and compassion

00:22:51.290 --> 00:22:58.790
because these love and compassion is the

00:22:54.740 --> 00:23:01.430
quality of a mother of a woman and if

00:22:58.790 --> 00:23:04.220
the women don't have that quality it's

00:23:01.430 --> 00:23:08.660
useless to be a woman all the time

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:11.420
if you are busy about your useless

00:23:08.660 --> 00:23:15.020
things like fashions or phases and all

00:23:11.420 --> 00:23:17.750
that at the time is all wasted you have

00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:19.790
a short time now got your realization

00:23:17.750 --> 00:23:23.870
and you must decide what have you done

00:23:19.790 --> 00:23:39.490
so far what have you achieved for so far

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:43.700
[Music]

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:46.550
can i guide myself have I got the light

00:23:43.700 --> 00:23:50.950
of the Spirit on my attention so well

00:23:46.550 --> 00:23:54.490
established and manifested that I can

00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:58.610
guide myself and guide others later on

00:23:54.490 --> 00:24:03.040
first of all and the Guru principle it

00:23:58.610 --> 00:24:07.300
is important that you see to yourself

00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:15.800
the introspection can I be my own goal

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:23.660
have I become my own rules now in your

00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:28.430
face your guru is a mother a woman so it

00:24:23.660 --> 00:24:34.820
has to be among women that the

00:24:28.430 --> 00:24:38.330
development of their guru qualities have

00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:42.980
to be very very manifested but it's just

00:24:38.330 --> 00:24:46.360
the way it is not for them they are

00:24:42.980 --> 00:24:49.460
still the mothers or their the wives or

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:54.940
their sahaja yoginis but they don't

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:58.250
realize that you are also the gurus

00:24:54.940 --> 00:25:00.890
because your mother is a guru because

00:24:58.250 --> 00:25:04.730
she is a woman and you have to be also

00:25:00.890 --> 00:25:07.760
of that quality that people should say

00:25:04.730 --> 00:25:10.490
look at this woman she's such a girl but

00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:13.970
still as I hear from the different

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:17.480
leaders that the ladies are absolutely

00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:20.330
still very much far away and are very

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:26.170
few who can be called as real sahaja

00:25:20.330 --> 00:25:30.320
yoginis it's a sad thing to hear because

00:25:26.170 --> 00:25:36.200
if you still keep to all these mundane

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:38.210
things of womanhood and the drawbacks of

00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:41.540
womanhood which has come out of

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:43.690
domination maybe because of always they

00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:45.290
were shown to be something door

00:25:43.690 --> 00:25:47.880
especially in the Christian religion

00:25:45.290 --> 00:25:53.690
they were never regarded as

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:56.100
something Ori they have this kind of a

00:25:53.690 --> 00:25:59.070
difference in them that they don't

00:25:56.100 --> 00:26:01.760
understand that Dharma can be

00:25:59.070 --> 00:26:05.550
established more by women than by men

00:26:01.760 --> 00:26:10.260
and the Guru's work is to establish the

00:26:05.550 --> 00:26:14.610
Dharma in the society in the family in

00:26:10.260 --> 00:26:18.290
relationships all these gurus which are

00:26:14.610 --> 00:26:20.850
representing all these made symbols here

00:26:18.290 --> 00:26:24.510
have done nothing but have established

00:26:20.850 --> 00:26:27.090
them but first of all before

00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:29.370
establishing the Dharma we should watch

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:36.260
ourselves have you got Dharma within

00:26:29.370 --> 00:26:40.940
ourselves or not first of all the

00:26:36.260 --> 00:26:49.610
quality of a person who has Dharma is

00:26:40.940 --> 00:26:52.110
that he listens to others he obeys and

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:54.210
this is something has gone wrong with

00:26:52.110 --> 00:26:57.690
the Western women I think that they're

00:26:54.210 --> 00:27:00.750
forgotten how to listen to others how to

00:26:57.690 --> 00:27:03.230
obey us that's why their children also

00:27:00.750 --> 00:27:03.230
don't over

00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:10.160
[Music]

00:27:18.339 --> 00:27:23.450
it just should become innate such you

00:27:21.619 --> 00:27:27.799
don't have to work it out but should

00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:29.749

00:28:19.249 --> 00:28:23.749

00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:51.270
tricks correct I am but there's a very

00:28:48.610 --> 00:28:56.650

and I have to specially make a very

00:31:10.610 --> 00:31:15.740
important request to the women that in

00:31:13.700 --> 00:31:18.100
these modern times they are the ones who

00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:21.560
are going to save the world not the men

00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:24.140
they have done their job before no it is

00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.550
for you to say with your understanding

00:31:24.140 --> 00:31:28.520
with your compassion with your

00:31:25.550 --> 00:31:31.700

00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:36.550
innate love not only your children your

00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:36.550
husband your family but the whole world

00:31:37.150 --> 00:31:47.810

00:31:47.810 --> 00:31:57.860
tremendous experience with some of the

00:31:51.130 --> 00:32:00.530
very great sahaja yoginis we have some

00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:07.310
of them have achieved really as you can

00:32:00.530 --> 00:32:11.300
say the constant state of bliss really

00:32:07.310 --> 00:32:14.810
some of them have in the constant state

00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:19.430
of bliss even if they are coming

00:32:14.810 --> 00:32:22.700
immediately I can feel their come the

00:32:19.430 --> 00:32:30.250
whole atmosphere waits for them the

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:34.780
whole cosmos just in complete respectful

00:32:30.250 --> 00:32:39.770
attendance is waiting for their arrival

00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:42.080
there are women of that quality and we

00:32:39.770 --> 00:32:45.770
have to take them as ideals and not the

00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:50.360
stupid useless vain women we have to

00:32:45.770 --> 00:32:52.550
take them as something great this is

00:32:50.360 --> 00:32:55.340
what I have to tell you that the

00:32:52.550 --> 00:32:57.530
potential within you is very good sahaja

00:32:55.340 --> 00:33:02.510
yoga should not be limited to you or to

00:32:57.530 --> 00:33:05.990
your children but the ladies of sahaja

00:33:02.510 --> 00:33:08.450
yoga have to work it out they have to

00:33:05.990 --> 00:33:12.590
see that they give that power to their

00:33:08.450 --> 00:33:15.020
men if I find any husband weak I know

00:33:12.590 --> 00:33:18.130
it's the wife who is a nagger

00:33:15.020 --> 00:33:24.580
or who is a dominating person

00:33:18.130 --> 00:33:30.400
of who things to endure herself and if I

00:33:24.580 --> 00:33:35.700
see a man so powerful I know there's a

00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:44.260
woman behind him it's just like

00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:46.360
electricity and a light and the lamp if

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.280
the electricity is flowing all right the

00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:52.090
lamp is burned

00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:55.840
absolutely that but if you are

00:33:52.090 --> 00:34:02.620
identified with a stupid vain women then

00:33:55.840 --> 00:34:05.800
you are lost you be finished if you know

00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:10.090
what I am if you know what I am saying

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:19.320
and if you try to follow what you have

00:34:10.090 --> 00:34:25.830
to do then you will immediately see that

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:25.830
mother is trying to strengthen our roots

00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:31.710
because you are the roots of the trees

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:43.330
you have to give all the nourishment you

00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:48.820
have to be motherly sisterly towards all

00:34:43.330 --> 00:34:52.060
the other sahaja Yogi's not to quarrel

00:34:48.820 --> 00:35:00.410
to fight to say hard things that's not

00:34:52.060 --> 00:35:09.260
the job of a woman not to argue but

00:35:00.410 --> 00:35:11.839
be quiet and watch out even if they are

00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:15.559
catching on certain chakras you can

00:35:11.839 --> 00:35:18.880
cleanse them very well as wives you can

00:35:15.559 --> 00:35:21.680
work it out secretly you can do it

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:25.430
because the problem though it looks so

00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:31.369
dangerous and so destructive and

00:35:25.430 --> 00:35:36.799
shocking the keys are in the hands of

00:35:31.369 --> 00:35:40.730
the women of today they can just solve

00:35:36.799 --> 00:35:43.190
the problem like that if they decide and

00:35:40.730 --> 00:35:47.260
understand their glory and their value

00:35:43.190 --> 00:35:47.260
and do not make themselves cheap

00:35:47.380 --> 00:36:04.490
hankering after cheap popularity if I

00:35:57.380 --> 00:36:12.289
have been able to nail down this great

00:36:04.490 --> 00:36:17.690
problem to a very precise source of it

00:36:12.289 --> 00:36:20.779
and if you can manage the source I'm

00:36:17.690 --> 00:36:24.230
sure we can manage sahaja yoga we can

00:36:20.779 --> 00:36:30.619
manage the whole world and the humanity

00:36:24.230 --> 00:36:36.309
at large is going to be absolutely saved

00:36:30.619 --> 00:36:36.309
as that is your desire may God bless

00:36:41.030 --> 00:36:57.479
[Music]

00:37:01.670 --> 00:37:03.730
you
