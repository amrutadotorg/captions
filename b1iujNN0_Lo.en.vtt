00:00:14.008 --> 00:00:19.258
Today we have assembled here to do the Puja of Vishnumaya.

00:00:19.258 --> 00:00:32.509
Vishnumaya is created through human effort, also.

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:39.425
As you see the clouds, when they rub against each other,

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:49.091
then the electricity is created. So first the clouds have to be created.

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:58.799
The sun acts on the sea. See how many chakras come into play.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.800
Sea is the Void, and the sun acts on the sea.

00:01:03.841 --> 00:01:13.091
Also the moon acts on the sea. As a result of that, clouds are created.

00:01:13.091 --> 00:01:26.925
This electricity is not created in the ocean -- that would create problems.

00:01:26.966 --> 00:01:37.925
Is created in the sky so that everybody can see it, can hear it.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:45.050
They see it first and hear it later.

00:01:45.091 --> 00:01:52.175
It's all well organized, well calculated. That is Vishnumaya.

00:01:52.217 --> 00:02:00.883
But it was created, also, with some understanding

00:02:00.883 --> 00:02:05.717
by human beings on this earth. First of all they saw

00:02:05.717 --> 00:02:12.300
the two clouds rubbing each other.

00:02:12.342 --> 00:02:16.050
So in the primitive stage, human beings

00:02:16.091 --> 00:02:20.925
tried to rub two material things to create electricity.

00:02:20.966 --> 00:02:26.258
So two material things, that is two parts of matter,

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.509
when rubbed created the electricity. It's very significant to see:

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.300
matter can be used to create electricity.

00:02:37.342 --> 00:02:43.008
The spark of the electricity comes from the matter.

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:48.759
Without matter, they could not have started cooking the food.

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.634
So how it has helped the Void.

00:02:52.634 --> 00:02:59.050
First from the ocean, it went into the sky, gave the message to the people

00:02:59.091 --> 00:03:03.425
to create the electricity. See the love.

00:03:03.425 --> 00:03:07.175
Then people learned how to cook the food

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:19.133
for the digestion to be easier for human beings. How it comes back! From nature,

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:21.342
how human beings learn

00:03:21.342 --> 00:03:34.925
and do it for the good, betterment, hita, of human beings. This benevolent energy,

00:03:34.966 --> 00:03:41.467
which was meant for the benevolence of human beings, again was utilized.

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:46.717
As you see, this is the creation, all this is of Vishnumaya.

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:53.091
That's why it's a maya. With electricity you can create a maya,

00:03:53.091 --> 00:03:57.175
you know that very well, how you can create it. So many are here,

00:03:57.175 --> 00:04:01.717
luckily in such a spontaneous way,

00:04:01.717 --> 00:04:06.800
so many who are dealing with this electricity in creating maya.

00:04:06.841 --> 00:04:15.550
America is so much helped by this electricity, by Vishnumaya.

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.799
You're not thankful to it.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.175
Like you have got Niagara Falls, you have so many falls here.

00:04:23.175 --> 00:04:27.509
Again, the water when it falls -- it comes from water --

00:04:27.509 --> 00:04:38.717
when the water falls on the lower level, very lower level, then it moves the turbine

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.342
and those movements can create electricity.

00:04:42.383 --> 00:04:49.759
So you have hydrostatic electricity.

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:53.925
Also the electricity is produced, as you know, through coal.

00:04:53.966 --> 00:05:01.799
Now here, again, the Mother Earth works out for the betterment

00:05:01.799 --> 00:05:10.925
of human beings to create the coal in Her being.

00:05:10.966 --> 00:05:17.717
I think She must be taking all the baddhas, absorbing all of them in Her stomach,

00:05:17.717 --> 00:05:22.717
and must be burning the stones inside Her to make the coal.

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:28.717
And then that coal is used for making electricity.

00:05:28.759 --> 00:05:35.383
How much the nature is working for our betterment!

00:05:35.425 --> 00:05:39.383
Your New York would not have been there but for electricity.

00:05:39.425 --> 00:05:41.383
It stopped for fifteen minutes

00:05:41.383 --> 00:05:48.217
and you knew the power of electricity.

00:05:48.217 --> 00:05:56.509
You cannot move without it. We cannot exist without it. That's why it had to be used and created --

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:02.217
given you so much of benevolence. You cook with it; you see with it;

00:06:02.258 --> 00:06:07.634
you listen with it; you enjoy with it. You wouldn't have your televisions;

00:06:07.675 --> 00:06:10.091
you wouldn't have anything without electricity.

00:06:10.091 --> 00:06:13.217
You won't even have these "Exits" here written.

00:06:13.217 --> 00:06:15.925
You would have walked into the walls.

00:06:15.925 --> 00:06:21.050
So much of this Vishnumaya has worked,

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.966
but She is a Maya. She can create a maya.

00:06:25.008 --> 00:06:28.966
And this has created a big maya in the minds of human beings

00:06:29.008 --> 00:06:32.799
that we are on top of the world. You're not.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:42.759
If electricity recedes from you, you'll become again

00:06:42.799 --> 00:06:49.175
the same primitive people making electricity out of rubbing the stones -- take it from Me.

00:06:49.175 --> 00:06:55.759
This flow of electricity is available to you for your good,

00:06:55.759 --> 00:07:03.050
and not for your destruction. But what has happened today

00:07:03.091 --> 00:07:07.883
is that using this electricity for your destruction.

00:07:07.883 --> 00:07:12.966
I remember about, say, thirty, forty years back, or even earlier

00:07:12.966 --> 00:07:18.509
when we saw the films, they were not colored films, American films

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:25.175
were beautiful films with substance in it. They wouldn't show one married man

00:07:25.217 --> 00:07:28.675
running after another married woman. None of these stories.

00:07:28.675 --> 00:07:34.133
Very pure form of beautiful family life.

00:07:34.175 --> 00:07:38.925
Everything nourishing was shown.

00:07:38.966 --> 00:07:47.217
We don't hear of any such thing where they showed evil winning over.

00:07:47.217 --> 00:07:52.966
Now you find they show a thief, and the thief becomes the hero.

00:07:53.008 --> 00:08:00.467
Then the people see those films, and the children especially

00:08:00.509 --> 00:08:05.800
I've seen have that thief as the symbol of something great.

00:08:05.841 --> 00:08:10.841
So they are going against the Void completely,

00:08:10.883 --> 00:08:13.717
against the religion that is within us, absolutely.

00:08:13.759 --> 00:08:24.091
The thing that was to nourish the Void, the one that was to sustain you

00:08:24.133 --> 00:08:31.675
in your valences, is now disturbing the Void completely.

00:08:31.717 --> 00:08:36.300
That's the maya part of it - the same electricity

00:08:36.342 --> 00:08:41.592
which was to give you the right path, the light in the darkness,

00:08:41.634 --> 00:08:49.799
is now sucking you in like a magnet towards your destruction.

00:08:49.799 --> 00:08:57.759
This is the Vishnumaya Who came to this country in such a big way

00:08:57.759 --> 00:09:03.759
and then spread all over. Has given ideas to everyone.

00:09:03.799 --> 00:09:08.342
People picked up all your techniques, all your styles,

00:09:08.342 --> 00:09:13.425
I mean you have Hollywood and all these very famous people

00:09:13.467 --> 00:09:16.425
here who have thrived on this electricity.

00:09:16.425 --> 00:09:22.592
But without thanking the Vishnumaya, they started doing things

00:09:22.634 --> 00:09:29.050
which were against Vishnumaya. This Vishnumaya is the One Who has helped you

00:09:29.091 --> 00:09:33.342
because She is the Sister of Shri Krishna;

00:09:33.383 --> 00:09:37.592
and because this is the domain of Shri Krishna, She came down here to help you.

00:09:37.592 --> 00:09:40.717
Now She's the Sister -- this must be understood very well.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:44.883
Now sisterly relation is a pure relationship.

00:09:44.883 --> 00:09:49.925
Now, of course, everything is so confused, but that's the purest relationship

00:09:49.966 --> 00:09:52.841
between the brother and the sister.

00:09:52.883 --> 00:09:57.925
The brother is protected by sister.

00:09:57.925 --> 00:10:08.799
And the sister's chastity is looked after by the brother.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:11.258
A brother who doesn't feel hurt

00:10:11.258 --> 00:10:17.133
if his sister chastity is in danger

00:10:17.175 --> 00:10:21.008
or she plays about with her chastity, he is not a brother.

00:10:21.008 --> 00:10:24.759
He is not a brother anymore. He's responsible

00:10:24.759 --> 00:10:28.592
to see that his sister keeps her chastity.

00:10:28.634 --> 00:10:34.133
Only her chastity can protect him -- it's a mutual working.

00:10:34.175 --> 00:10:41.592
This feeling, if it does not develop that, "She is my sister

00:10:41.634 --> 00:10:45.550
and that I have to look after her chastity,

00:10:45.592 --> 00:10:47.509
for that I have to behave myself well,

00:10:47.509 --> 00:10:50.300
so that she doesn't find faults with me."

00:10:50.342 --> 00:10:53.925
It's such a cleansing process this relationship has,

00:10:53.966 --> 00:10:58.008
as much as the electricity has the cleansing process for you.

00:10:58.008 --> 00:11:01.841
Everywhere what the electricity does,

00:11:01.841 --> 00:11:06.091
a sister does for her brother -- she cooks for him,

00:11:06.133 --> 00:11:12.799
she tells him the right path, she enlightens him and sometimes

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:18.799
shocks him, also. They have to have certain shocks;

00:11:18.799 --> 00:11:21.966
otherwise they will not know how to work it out.

00:11:22.008 --> 00:11:26.717
And the best of all, she's the one for whom you have to be

00:11:26.759 --> 00:11:32.258
very careful to know the technique how to handle your sister.

00:11:32.258 --> 00:11:35.799
If you do not know how to handle your sister,

00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:38.841
you can be absolutely wrong

00:11:38.883 --> 00:11:45.467
and you may get it -- something that you would never expect to get.

00:11:45.509 --> 00:11:49.759
So one must understand how to handle a sister.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:53.509
In this case, we have to know that the same

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:59.717
was born again at the time of Shri Krishna as Draupadi.

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:10.342
She took Her birth as Draupadi. And when Draupadi was attacked by the Kauravas,

00:12:10.342 --> 00:12:15.759
they wanted to remove Her sari.

00:12:15.799 --> 00:12:23.258
So remove the sari itself is a symbol that they challenged her chastity.

00:12:23.300 --> 00:12:27.550
Now if you see in the Maya Nagri, women have no sense at all

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:33.091
that they should cover this part of their body.

00:12:33.133 --> 00:12:35.925
In this Maya Nagri, the other way round.

00:12:35.966 --> 00:12:40.592
When I heard the very responsible person saying that, "In our culture,

00:12:40.592 --> 00:12:47.050
women must expose their body." What is this culture? Is anti-Krishna,

00:12:47.091 --> 00:12:52.050
completely anti-Vishnumaya. Such people

00:12:52.050 --> 00:12:58.759
will get into trouble, I'm sure, with electrical problems.

00:12:58.759 --> 00:13:13.509
The brothers who do not bother about the chastity of the husband of their sister,

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:25.258
and also supporting and asking to do wrong things, hide his things,

00:13:25.258 --> 00:13:33.966
are also equally responsible. Like in Sahaja Yoga, you know

00:13:34.008 --> 00:13:39.300
that a sister is to be protected; and the sister husband,

00:13:39.342 --> 00:13:44.091
if he's doing anything wrong, he's to be told off by the brother.

00:13:44.133 --> 00:13:51.050
Like once in India, one newspaper passed some remarks about Me.

00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:54.759
My brothers were up in arms. I thought,

00:13:54.799 --> 00:13:57.300
"Now, it's going to be terrible. How am I to manage it?"

00:13:57.300 --> 00:14:03.217
It was a big, strong ... They were going to go to the courts. When I told them, "I'll not go to the courts."

00:14:03.258 --> 00:14:04.925
"All right, don't go. But we'll go."

00:14:04.925 --> 00:14:08.217
They told My husband also. My husband and My brothers put together,

00:14:08.258 --> 00:14:12.217
it was formidable! I didn't know what to do.

00:14:12.258 --> 00:14:17.133
I wrote to one Sahaja Yogi that, "Go and see the editor of the newspaper.

00:14:17.133 --> 00:14:18.717
Tell him that these are My brothers,

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:24.217
be careful. They are very powerful people in India and from here My husband. It's terrible."

00:14:24.258 --> 00:14:30.133
But they would not apologize. So I thought of another Vishnumaya

00:14:30.175 --> 00:14:40.258
that there was a big strike and the paper was closed for exactly six months.

00:14:40.258 --> 00:14:47.091
And they had to go in for a big, very big losses. And when they started,

00:14:47.133 --> 00:14:52.133
the people who were working there came back and said that,

00:14:52.175 --> 00:14:56.717
"Why did you write against Shri Mataji? We're not going to come back."

00:14:56.759 --> 00:14:59.717
And they had to apologize.

00:14:59.717 --> 00:15:06.509
So how the brother's love can compel even Adi Shakti

00:15:06.509 --> 00:15:13.759
to do things that She would not normally do. In the same way,

00:15:13.799 --> 00:15:19.925
when Draupadi was challenged, Shri Krishna was not in Hastinapur

00:15:19.925 --> 00:15:29.759
where it happened. He was thousand, at least more than thousand miles away from that place.

00:15:29.799 --> 00:15:39.759
He said that, "Shankha chakra gada padma, garuda lai sidhare."

00:15:39.759 --> 00:15:47.300
He came on His condor with all His weapons -- shankha, chakra, gada, padma.

00:15:47.342 --> 00:15:53.634
All these He brought to save the chastity of His Sister.

00:15:53.675 --> 00:15:56.383
There are many incidents in our history,

00:15:56.425 --> 00:16:02.509
I don't know if I can cite anything in your history. But I would say

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:07.425
when I see Abraham Lincoln I think he was a great brother

00:16:07.467 --> 00:16:15.383
to the Statue of Liberty. The way he fought for women

00:16:15.425 --> 00:16:20.050
in such pure love and without taking any money,

00:16:20.091 --> 00:16:32.467
without charging them anything, to punish the husbands who were drunkards.

00:16:32.467 --> 00:16:37.841
That's just like a very good, powerful brother to behave.

00:16:37.883 --> 00:16:43.383
But those feelings are now dying out I think.

00:16:43.425 --> 00:16:52.675
But say in Russia, when I went, went to see Lenin's house and through out,

00:16:52.717 --> 00:16:57.759
apart from his wife, was his sister who helped him --

00:16:57.799 --> 00:17:02.383
to type for him, to do all his official work.

00:17:02.425 --> 00:17:09.925
He has written volumes and volumes of books in that small age

00:17:09.925 --> 00:17:12.467
of fifty-four years, volumes!

00:17:12.509 --> 00:17:16.592
First of all he was in Siberia and just imagine,

00:17:16.592 --> 00:17:20.675
this sister of his has typed most of it.

00:17:20.675 --> 00:17:27.425
Throughout in the whole tour, we felt the presence of the sister

00:17:27.425 --> 00:17:30.966
and the way she has helped her brother.

00:17:30.966 --> 00:17:37.175
This relationship is so pure which doesn't want anything.

00:17:37.217 --> 00:17:41.925
A wife may say that, "If you don't give me a coat, I'll divorce you."

00:17:41.966 --> 00:17:45.425
May in England and possibly in America they say so.

00:17:45.467 --> 00:17:51.509
But a sister cannot divorce. She cannot divorce.

00:17:51.509 --> 00:17:56.467
This time in the newspaper, they published the name of My brother.

00:17:56.509 --> 00:18:00.383
So I said, "What can I do? He's My brother, so he's My brother."

00:18:00.383 --> 00:18:09.091
Good, bad, anything, he's My brother, I cannot divorce.

00:18:09.133 --> 00:18:15.634
It's something, a relationship which you cannot break.

00:18:15.675 --> 00:18:19.759
Nature has given you this relationship.

00:18:19.759 --> 00:18:23.966
But when you come to the collective, it's very important

00:18:24.008 --> 00:18:32.717
that we must respect this relationship. If you do not respect this relationship,

00:18:32.717 --> 00:18:40.008
you cannot work out collectively. Like in a party I go

00:18:40.050 --> 00:18:44.342
and I feel something very funny happening.

00:18:44.383 --> 00:18:50.425
Somebody's wife is entangled with somebody's husband.

00:18:50.467 --> 00:18:55.091
All sorts of funny things happen. But in collective

00:18:55.133 --> 00:18:59.425
if you know, except for my wife the rest of them are my sisters.

00:18:59.467 --> 00:19:01.509
The purity settles in like that,

00:19:01.550 --> 00:19:05.300
you don't have to worry. They're my sisters.

00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:11.091
And your eyes steady out.

00:19:11.091 --> 00:19:14.675
Innocence starts pouring out of your eyes.

00:19:14.717 --> 00:19:21.592
It's a very, very simple thing. So in the eye, when you get your Realization,

00:19:21.634 --> 00:19:25.509
you get a glint -- must have seen, there's a shine

00:19:25.509 --> 00:19:31.467
that is Vishnumaya. That is the Vishnumaya which shines through your eyes.

00:19:31.467 --> 00:19:36.467
And She's the One Who makes you through the maya of Vishnumaya.

00:19:36.509 --> 00:19:41.550
This glint in the eye you must have seen in people who are realized souls

00:19:41.592 --> 00:19:51.841
and this glint in the eye is the one that makes you understand and feel the beauty

00:19:51.841 --> 00:19:58.883
and the power of sisterly/brotherly relationship.

00:19:58.925 --> 00:20:07.467
In the beginning of Sahaja Yoga, I found it impossible to establish this.

00:20:07.467 --> 00:20:16.300
So I said, "Let's try the Vishnumaya." And it worked.

00:20:16.342 --> 00:20:20.133
Actually, naturally we know this is wrong.

00:20:20.133 --> 00:20:24.133
We know that it is wrong, naturally.

00:20:24.175 --> 00:20:26.799
We don't have to have a law for it.

00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:31.799
One lady come to America with her brother and she told Me

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:34.883
when I had not come to America, "It's a funny place."

00:20:34.925 --> 00:20:39.133
She said, "I went to America and we wanted to stay in one room",

00:20:39.175 --> 00:20:42.175
because they wanted to save some money. They said, "No. If you are brothers

00:20:42.175 --> 00:20:47.133
and sisters, you can't stay." She said, "Why? I mean in India

00:20:47.175 --> 00:20:49.592
if you are brother and sister you can always stay.

00:20:49.634 --> 00:20:57.217
If you are not brother and sister, then of course you can't stay, you don't stay together,

00:20:57.258 --> 00:21:00.175
the other way round. If you are brother and sister

00:21:00.217 --> 00:21:03.800
you cannot stay in one room in a hotel under law.

00:21:03.841 --> 00:21:08.841
And it's a father and a daughter you can't stay in one room.

00:21:08.883 --> 00:21:14.050
Absurd. I mean for us Indians it's a shock. I said, "But why?"

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:17.425
I just couldn't understand. Now I know what it is,

00:21:17.467 --> 00:21:21.467
that it has become now a law to that extent.

00:21:21.509 --> 00:21:25.133
To us, it is absurd to have such a law.

00:21:25.133 --> 00:21:28.799
And, as we have learned so many things from you

00:21:28.800 --> 00:21:33.050
about electricity, you also better learn from us certain thing

00:21:33.050 --> 00:21:36.841
about Vishnumaya's powers.

00:21:36.883 --> 00:21:40.342
There's no harm in learning something for the roots,

00:21:40.383 --> 00:21:43.425
because if the tree has gone wrong,

00:21:43.425 --> 00:21:48.300
it has to learn something very much essential from the roots and that is it,

00:21:48.342 --> 00:21:52.675
the purity of relationship between brothers and sisters.

00:21:52.675 --> 00:21:54.883
The sister relationship

00:21:54.925 --> 00:22:03.883
always gives a very big cementing force for the husband and wife.

00:22:03.925 --> 00:22:07.759
I know if My husband tries to trouble Me,

00:22:07.799 --> 00:22:11.467
his own sister will be after his life.

00:22:11.467 --> 00:22:17.091
And he'd better be careful about it and same with Me.

00:22:17.133 --> 00:22:24.175
If I do anything wrong, My brother will side with My husband and not with Me.

00:22:24.217 --> 00:22:27.634
So it cements the relationships very well.

00:22:27.634 --> 00:22:34.091
In the history that I know of two very beautiful incidents I'll tell you

00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:39.717
which come to My mind today is one of Shivaji.

00:22:39.759 --> 00:22:45.883
When Shivaji -- it's twice it has happened in his lifetime which is very remarkable.

00:22:45.925 --> 00:22:53.008
He was once presented with a lady, was very beautiful.

00:22:53.050 --> 00:23:00.841
And people had plundered her things and all her ornaments,

00:23:00.883 --> 00:23:07.675
because she was a daughter of a Muslim courtesan,

00:23:07.717 --> 00:23:13.008
as you call the courtier. And they tried to plunder him

00:23:13.008 --> 00:23:22.300
and they brought this beautiful woman before Shivaji. So Shivaji looked at her and said,

00:23:22.300 --> 00:23:28.799
"Please remove your veil", because Muslims have a veil.

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:36.675
And when she removed her veil, he said that, "If my mother was as beautiful as you are,

00:23:36.717 --> 00:23:42.883
I would have been equally beautiful." What a thing to say - what a poetic thing to say!

00:23:42.883 --> 00:23:45.133
That is that, "If you were my mother,

00:23:45.175 --> 00:23:48.091
I would have been as beautiful as you are",

00:23:48.091 --> 00:23:52.634
means you are my sister.

00:23:52.634 --> 00:23:55.008
And then he got very angry with all these people

00:23:55.050 --> 00:23:57.342
and he asked them that, "You'd better take her away

00:23:57.383 --> 00:24:00.966
and never do such a thing to any woman." And not only,

00:24:01.008 --> 00:24:04.300
but he gave lots of ornaments and lots of things to her

00:24:04.342 --> 00:24:07.050
to say that she's a sister

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:10.133
going to the husband with all respect and regard.

00:24:10.175 --> 00:24:19.383
And this gentleman, her husband, was a very deadly enemy of Shivaji.

00:24:19.425 --> 00:24:28.925
How he solved the problem with such purity and then this gentleman

00:24:28.966 --> 00:24:33.717
become sort of a milder person with this gesture of his.

00:24:33.717 --> 00:24:39.425
Second in his lifetime we hear about a fort

00:24:39.425 --> 00:24:46.133
which is now very close to My house in Pune was, there was a Rajput lady

00:24:46.175 --> 00:24:50.008
called Kamal Kumari, who was entrapped by the man

00:24:50.050 --> 00:24:57.675
who was the officer of that fort, who was a Muslim.

00:24:57.717 --> 00:25:02.383
And he was telling this Kamal Kumari that, "You must marry me." And she would not accept.

00:25:02.425 --> 00:25:08.841
They had brought her from somewhere sort of by force. And she would not accept;

00:25:08.841 --> 00:25:15.133
she was Rajput. And he said, "By tomorrow, you'll have to marry me."

00:25:15.175 --> 00:25:25.133
This lady didn't know what to do, so with someone very secretly

00:25:25.133 --> 00:25:29.634
she sent a letter to Shivaji with a rakhi.

00:25:29.675 --> 00:25:36.300
But it reached the mother of Shivaji.

00:25:36.300 --> 00:25:46.342
Mother sent a letter, sent a message, to Shivaji on a horse that, "Come here as fast as possible --

00:25:46.342 --> 00:25:49.634
if you're eating your food, then come here to wash your hands"

00:25:49.634 --> 00:25:54.217
to that extent. And Shivaji was so obedient to his mother,

00:25:54.258 --> 00:25:59.133
very obedient. One has to learn from his character.

00:25:59.175 --> 00:26:06.050
He rushed there, because obedience was his power.

00:26:06.091 --> 00:26:09.759
He rushed there and asked, "Mother, what is it?"

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:13.300
She said, "No, I want to play chess with you."

00:26:13.342 --> 00:26:18.425
He said, "Why now?" "I must play chess." He couldn't understand.

00:26:18.467 --> 00:26:24.050
And she played chess and she won something. She could have told him,

00:26:24.091 --> 00:26:30.799
but she just wanted to sort of put a Vishnumaya on him. He lost.

00:26:30.799 --> 00:26:34.342
"Mother, what do you want?" She said, "Today

00:26:34.383 --> 00:26:41.509
I want you by night to capture this fort."

00:26:41.550 --> 00:26:52.509
"Today?" "Yes." Then she showed him the letter and the rakhi.

00:26:52.509 --> 00:26:56.799
Rakhi was so powerful that a mother had to ask her son,

00:26:56.799 --> 00:27:00.800
who was responsible for the deliverance of Maharashtra

00:27:00.841 --> 00:27:09.841
from the clutches of the Muslims, that he should go to this fort and capture it.

00:27:09.883 --> 00:27:16.759
Such a powerful message out of that string. So. All right. Came out.

00:27:16.759 --> 00:27:19.425
He was quite upset how to do it.

00:27:19.467 --> 00:27:22.550
Suddenly there was one gentleman called Tanaji,

00:27:22.592 --> 00:27:26.675
he had come to invite him for his son's wedding with his uncle.

00:27:26.717 --> 00:27:33.550
And he saw him so upset he said, "Why are you so upset, sir?"

00:27:33.592 --> 00:27:38.050
He said, "My mother has asked me such and such thing." He said, "All right, I'm going.

00:27:38.050 --> 00:27:42.342
You don't have to go, because we'll have many Tanaji's like me

00:27:42.383 --> 00:27:46.717
but we have only one Shivaji. I'm going to do it." He said, "But your son is going to marry."

00:27:46.759 --> 00:27:52.342
He said, "First let my sword marry this fort,

00:27:52.383 --> 00:27:56.008
then I will marry my son." Such people we had also.

00:27:56.050 --> 00:28:01.175
Such sacrifice. Only on that rakhi. Think of that, only one rakhi!

00:28:01.217 --> 00:28:04.008
All right. They didn't know this girl, they didn't know her father,

00:28:04.050 --> 00:28:06.550
they didn't know anything about her, they had never seen her.

00:28:06.592 --> 00:28:13.383
Can you think of somebody who will do like this in modern times?

00:28:13.425 --> 00:28:17.008
We are supposed to be very evolved, powerful, great people.

00:28:17.050 --> 00:28:21.217
Even in the pictures we need not show it.

00:28:21.258 --> 00:28:23.799
Nobody will come to see such a film because

00:28:23.841 --> 00:28:29.800
they'll feel so low. And he went there

00:28:29.841 --> 00:28:38.634
and he used a kind of a big lizard which went and fixed the nails.

00:28:38.675 --> 00:28:46.925
With a rope he climbed up and they conquered and won that fort.

00:28:46.925 --> 00:28:50.883
It was decided that if they are successful they should lit fire

00:28:50.925 --> 00:28:53.759
which Shivaji can see and come down.

00:28:53.759 --> 00:28:55.675
He saw the fire early in the morning so went there.

00:28:55.717 --> 00:29:00.175
And under a tree the dead body of this Tanaji was lying.

00:29:00.217 --> 00:29:08.091
He looked at it and he said, "We have got the fort but we have lost a lion."

00:29:08.133 --> 00:29:11.675
That's why it's called as the Fort of the Lion, Sinhagad,

00:29:11.717 --> 00:29:14.133
which you can see from My house very clearly.

00:29:14.133 --> 00:29:18.425
But these are the monuments of a small thing called a rakhi.

00:29:18.467 --> 00:29:28.217
A small symbol of expression

00:29:28.217 --> 00:29:35.133
that can capture forts after forts.

00:29:35.133 --> 00:29:42.592
Another one where -- I've told this story before but I'll repeat it today --

00:29:42.634 --> 00:29:46.091
was when Alexander the Great arrested

00:29:46.133 --> 00:29:53.175
one king called Puru. Alexander had married an Indian lady

00:29:53.217 --> 00:30:02.008
and the great Alexander was in jail. That was the day of Vishnumaya.

00:30:02.008 --> 00:30:09.467
So she sent -- this lady was very clever, his wife -- she sent a rakhi

00:30:09.509 --> 00:30:16.717
in a small, little thali covered nicely to the King Puru.

00:30:16.759 --> 00:30:24.258
And, as the rituals are, that day this was presented to him. So he had to accept.

00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:29.300
If it is sent, you have to accept. A sister sends it with deliberations

00:30:29.342 --> 00:30:34.342
but you have to accept. And he accepted it, and it was tied.

00:30:34.383 --> 00:30:36.759
Then he said, "Who is my sister?"

00:30:36.759 --> 00:30:43.509
They said, "Your sister is the wife of Alexander." Said,

00:30:43.550 --> 00:30:47.799
"Oh God, that means I have arrested my own brother-in-law!"

00:30:47.799 --> 00:30:50.425
Immediately becomes a brother-in-law, immediately.

00:30:50.467 --> 00:30:53.217
No marriage took place, nothing. He's a brother-in-law.

00:30:53.258 --> 00:31:01.717
He rushed to the jail, fell flat before the great emperor.

00:31:01.759 --> 00:31:05.467
He couldn't understand, "What's happening to Puru?

00:31:05.509 --> 00:31:10.467
Why did he do all this?" He said, "Sir, I am sorry", in his own language,

00:31:10.467 --> 00:31:13.217
"I'm sorry I didn't know you were my brother-in-law.

00:31:13.217 --> 00:31:16.799
I'm sorry whatever I've done. Will you forgive me?" and all that.

00:31:16.799 --> 00:31:23.300
And he brought him, asked him to sit on his throne.

00:31:23.300 --> 00:31:26.008
He couldn't understand, "What's this going on?"

00:31:26.050 --> 00:31:30.008
"Please." Made him sit there, garlanded him, did his aarti,

00:31:30.008 --> 00:31:37.800
gave him ornaments, gave him big garlands of diamonds and rubies and things,

00:31:37.841 --> 00:31:43.841
and touched his feet, washed his feet and then, with great honor, sent him home.

00:31:43.841 --> 00:31:45.799
He couldn't understand.

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.342
"Has he gone mad or he's possessed by someone?"

00:31:48.342 --> 00:31:51.175
He must have thought, "Some Greek has possessed this fellow",

00:31:51.217 --> 00:31:53.841
the way he was surrendering.

00:31:53.883 --> 00:31:59.592
When he went home his wife was smiling.

00:31:59.634 --> 00:32:01.091
He said, "Why are you smiling?"

00:32:01.133 --> 00:32:04.592
She said, "I knew the trick will work with Indian mind."

00:32:04.634 --> 00:32:08.925
"What was the trick?" She showed him one string. "This was the trick."

00:32:08.966 --> 00:32:10.925
He couldn't understand, started looking at it.

00:32:10.966 --> 00:32:16.634
"What is this?" She said, "This is the rakhi. This is the thing I sent him.

00:32:16.634 --> 00:32:21.592
This has the symbol of a sister, that's how you're released."

00:32:21.592 --> 00:32:24.133
Alexander sat back.

00:32:24.133 --> 00:32:30.175
He said, "Oh God, these people can release their enemies on a string?

00:32:30.217 --> 00:32:33.759
I can't capture these people. They are too good.

00:32:33.799 --> 00:32:37.717
They are too subtle. These subtleties we cannot understand."

00:32:37.759 --> 00:32:41.217
And he turned back. But he took some poets with him

00:32:41.217 --> 00:32:46.217
who sang his praise, how he was, what a generous man.

00:32:46.217 --> 00:32:51.675
But I must say it is rather surprising to see such a subtle man in Greece.

00:32:51.717 --> 00:32:56.634
But maybe that was the time for them to understand subtleties,

00:32:56.675 --> 00:32:58.841
but today I don't have much hopes.

00:32:58.883 --> 00:33:02.008
As I've seen them, they are not that subtle.

00:33:02.050 --> 00:33:08.966
They only have people like Onassis who are their heroes, whom they worship.

00:33:09.008 --> 00:33:12.258
From where to what we have come? How we have used

00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:15.217
the same good things from horrible things now.

00:33:15.258 --> 00:33:18.799
How far we have gone. And I would say the same Vishnumaya

00:33:18.841 --> 00:33:22.217
has now put into this maya that you go to hell now,

00:33:22.258 --> 00:33:25.258
finished. It is She Who has arranged this point.

00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:29.592
She doesn't think that Americans deserve to be in Sahaja Yoga.

00:33:29.634 --> 00:33:35.133
It is She Who's fighting Me. She says, "Mother, forget it, forget it, forget it!"

00:33:35.133 --> 00:33:39.217
See the films -- one worse than the other.

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:44.050
You see the recent pictures, the modern ones, you can't even see them,

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.634
you have to close your eyes. The same power now

00:33:47.675 --> 00:33:52.467
is for your destruction, used by you only.

00:33:52.467 --> 00:33:57.841
You are using it for your own destruction. All these films

00:33:57.883 --> 00:34:02.383
are working you out to fight each other,

00:34:02.425 --> 00:34:05.008
destroy each other, how to kill each other,

00:34:05.008 --> 00:34:09.217
how to be violent, how to be ugly, how to be shameless,

00:34:09.258 --> 00:34:12.550
how to have no self-respect, and no respect for others.

00:34:12.592 --> 00:34:15.008
Is all coming through these medias.

00:34:15.050 --> 00:34:19.550
Your children are so rude. Nobody listens to anyone.

00:34:19.592 --> 00:34:26.800
Nobody respects their elders. If somebody is a simple, honest, intelligent,

00:34:26.841 --> 00:34:32.175
brilliant man, they think he's a fool because he doesn't know how to outwit you.

00:34:32.217 --> 00:34:34.592
He doesn't know how to talk sharply,

00:34:34.592 --> 00:34:37.717
because he doesn't know how to insult you all the time.

00:34:37.759 --> 00:34:44.258
The whole film industry is now working out how to coin

00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:48.217
more insulting words. The more insulting words there are,

00:34:48.217 --> 00:34:51.841
the better it is. And that's what the public wants,

00:34:51.883 --> 00:34:55.800
because now it has become a economic thing

00:34:55.841 --> 00:35:02.467
to use films for economic purposes. When money becomes everything --

00:35:02.467 --> 00:35:05.300
what is prostitution, you get money, what's wrong?

00:35:05.342 --> 00:35:07.133
What is wrong in destroying your family?

00:35:07.175 --> 00:35:08.966
You get money? It's all right.

00:35:08.966 --> 00:35:10.717
Now, are you going to take this money with you,

00:35:10.759 --> 00:35:14.467
or are you going to leave this barbaric children on this country?

00:35:14.509 --> 00:35:19.133
What are you going to achieve? And the money orientation is so much

00:35:19.175 --> 00:35:23.799
that people say that Americans are the most miserly people,

00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:30.050
they are very self-indulgent and the most miserly people, while here it is the Vishnumaya

00:35:30.050 --> 00:35:36.966
which is the most generous thing. She burns Herself off to give you light.

00:35:36.966 --> 00:35:43.300
And the miserliness also comes with money-orientation.

00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:47.300
They are also very mischievous,

00:35:47.342 --> 00:35:51.966
sometimes they try to play such tricks which are very heinous and horrible.

00:35:52.008 --> 00:35:59.799
Then electricity has to work and I don't know, I don't know about Her, how She'll work it out.

00:35:59.799 --> 00:36:04.342
But She's very angry, with Americans especially,

00:36:04.383 --> 00:36:08.509
because this is the country of Her Brother.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:13.883
This is the country where Her Brother rules, and She wants

00:36:13.925 --> 00:36:21.383
everything to be all right, because from here is generated all these nonsensical films

00:36:21.383 --> 00:36:26.091
nonsensical things which are destroying the whole world.

00:36:26.133 --> 00:36:32.050
AIDS is one of the blessings of Vishnumaya.

00:36:32.050 --> 00:36:36.425
It comes from Left Vishuddhi, people do not know.

00:36:36.467 --> 00:36:40.925
You start perspiring on the Left Vishuddhi to begin with.

00:36:40.966 --> 00:36:43.717
When people start feeling guilty,

00:36:43.717 --> 00:36:49.883
they should face it  and get rid of it.

00:36:49.925 --> 00:36:53.425
Of course it starts, as you say, with right sidedness.

00:36:53.467 --> 00:36:58.175
But this right sidedness ultimately ends up into Left Vishuddhi.

00:36:58.217 --> 00:37:02.175
And then the residual part of it starts generating.

00:37:02.175 --> 00:37:07.634
This kind of a weakness in a human being,

00:37:07.675 --> 00:37:13.342
because it is also the pure form of motherhood,

00:37:13.342 --> 00:37:19.759
is the Center Heart, is the pure form of motherhood.

00:37:19.799 --> 00:37:25.467
You see a child, you see a girl who is innocent. What interests her

00:37:25.509 --> 00:37:29.634
is her little dolly. She's the mother, out and out.

00:37:29.634 --> 00:37:35.300
If she's properly brought up, from very childhood she's a mother.

00:37:35.342 --> 00:37:41.050
And motherhood is the epitome of womanhood.

00:37:41.091 --> 00:37:44.467
There are some Sahaja Yogis also who are so stupid

00:37:44.467 --> 00:37:47.467
they don't want to have children after marriage.

00:37:47.467 --> 00:37:50.383
They should get out of Sahaja Yoga, immediately.

00:37:50.425 --> 00:37:54.467
We have not done all this to have people here

00:37:54.509 --> 00:37:58.217
who cannot produce children. If they can, they should.

00:37:58.217 --> 00:38:02.925
The reason is there are so many great souls who want to be born.

00:38:02.966 --> 00:38:08.883
These are the great fruits which are going to be prospering

00:38:08.883 --> 00:38:16.342
on the tree of your family life. And if you do not want to have any children,

00:38:16.342 --> 00:38:24.342
then what are you doing here? So the Vishnumaya's main thing

00:38:24.383 --> 00:38:32.966
is that a woman has to be a mother. Then that motherhood

00:38:33.008 --> 00:38:37.050
gives her that special capacity to shine.

00:38:37.091 --> 00:38:43.925
Now it starts with the Left Vishuddhi, the AIDS goes to the Center Heart.

00:38:43.966 --> 00:38:49.467
The Center Heart is challenged. The motherhood is lost.

00:38:49.509 --> 00:38:52.467
That's how the antibodies become weak.

00:38:52.509 --> 00:38:54.799
Once they are attacked, they become weak,

00:38:54.799 --> 00:39:00.175
they cannot fight the disease and that's how the person who gets AIDS

00:39:00.217 --> 00:39:06.759
has to face things in such a manner that it has no antibodies,

00:39:06.759 --> 00:39:14.925
so he becomes allergic to everything and he dies. To fight the AIDS,

00:39:14.966 --> 00:39:21.966
the sisters' and brothers' relations must be established

00:39:21.966 --> 00:39:25.799
so that sisters can look out for men,

00:39:25.799 --> 00:39:31.091
the way they are behaving, and they

00:39:31.133 --> 00:39:35.050
should look out for sisters, the way they are behaving.

00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:41.425
In this whole satanic movement I find

00:39:41.467 --> 00:39:44.467
the men become physically attacked

00:39:44.509 --> 00:39:49.634
and women become mentally attacked. And it's such an attack

00:39:49.634 --> 00:39:53.008
that women are difficult to get out of it.

00:39:53.050 --> 00:39:58.883
First of all, we have to decide what is our goal

00:39:58.925 --> 00:40:03.217
is to become the Spirit, and not a sex point.

00:40:03.217 --> 00:40:07.925
This maya has changed your goals completely.

00:40:07.925 --> 00:40:15.634
It's going to make you into worms or I don't know what else.

00:40:15.675 --> 00:40:19.300
Actually, this is what the Americans have to understand:

00:40:19.342 --> 00:40:23.509
where are they going? Everybody thinks that Americans

00:40:23.550 --> 00:40:26.509
are half-mad if not full-mad.

00:40:26.509 --> 00:40:29.467
Any American coming into any organization,

00:40:29.467 --> 00:40:32.800
"Oh, beware, American." Americans may not know about it.

00:40:32.841 --> 00:40:38.175
They never consider an American as a completely sane person.

00:40:38.217 --> 00:40:39.925
What is the reason? Because

00:40:39.925 --> 00:40:43.634
of this queer, weird, stupid ideas they have.

00:40:43.675 --> 00:40:52.217
But I heard that here the people claim that we have a fundamental right to be stupid and mad.

00:40:52.217 --> 00:41:00.091
This kind of a thing that is moving today in the country where you live,

00:41:00.091 --> 00:41:04.383
and if you have to save it, you have to turn their faces towards God.

00:41:04.425 --> 00:41:09.966
You have to turn their faces towards Self-Realization. And this is a very, very difficult task

00:41:10.008 --> 00:41:16.467
for which you all Sahaja Yogis, I request you and I pray for you,

00:41:16.509 --> 00:41:22.133
that you develop that kind of a power which is the Power of Vishnumaya

00:41:22.133 --> 00:41:24.799
that you shine with the Power of Vishnumaya.

00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:27.258
When I see your Statue of Liberty,

00:41:27.258 --> 00:41:29.717
I think she is the Vishnumaya  here standing.

00:41:29.759 --> 00:41:32.883
Why didn't they make a man stand there,

00:41:32.925 --> 00:41:39.925
why a woman? She is the symbol of the Sister, of Vishnumaya,

00:41:39.925 --> 00:41:42.592
and if you have to have your liberty, have it --

00:41:42.634 --> 00:41:47.425
but liberty of wisdom, not of stupidity.

00:41:47.467 --> 00:41:54.050
And this is what I have to tell you today in this great country of Shri Krishna,

00:41:54.091 --> 00:41:58.550
that you'd better be on the lookout. Better be on the lookout.

00:41:58.592 --> 00:42:05.925
You can say that She really rules in a proper way in South America,

00:42:05.925 --> 00:42:13.966
and that was Her domain, too. And there electricity is not so prevalent.

00:42:14.008 --> 00:42:19.550
But the perversion has started because they started producing cocaine

00:42:19.592 --> 00:42:22.675
and other horrible things to spoil your Left Vishuddhi.

00:42:22.717 --> 00:42:31.634
One feels guilty with one thing in the North America

00:42:31.634 --> 00:42:39.383
and another one makes it bad through cocaine, and is nicely transported here

00:42:39.425 --> 00:42:49.217
for you to spoil your Vishuddhi. This is an attack on Vishnumaya,

00:42:49.258 --> 00:42:53.217
another attack on Vishnumaya from the South

00:42:53.258 --> 00:42:57.008
because they are exporting. And once I asked them,

00:42:57.050 --> 00:42:59.050
"Why do you export it?" They said,

00:42:59.091 --> 00:43:02.258
"That is their lookout to save their people; it's not our lookout."

00:43:02.258 --> 00:43:07.008
In Colombia, officially. They feel that,

00:43:07.008 --> 00:43:09.675
"If the Americans cannot look after themselves,

00:43:09.717 --> 00:43:11.759
how can we look after our people?"

00:43:11.799 --> 00:43:16.175
And they're making a big money out of you because,

00:43:16.217 --> 00:43:18.800
"You paid so much attention to money. All right, have it.

00:43:18.841 --> 00:43:23.675
We'll also have money by giving you this horrible thing

00:43:23.675 --> 00:43:26.467
to spoil your Vishuddhis and take all your money,

00:43:26.509 --> 00:43:31.342
if you think money's that important." It's something, a very big play,

00:43:31.383 --> 00:43:35.550
it's a maya, it's a horrible maya into which this country has gone into.

00:43:35.592 --> 00:43:41.175
And you have to do it by shining examples

00:43:41.217 --> 00:43:46.799
to show how starkingly it is horrid

00:43:46.799 --> 00:43:50.008
the way we accept things so easily.

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:54.550
I'm sure this Vishnumaya will crack certain nuts here

00:43:54.592 --> 00:44:00.509
and I hope it will create a new path for Sahaja Yogis to follow,

00:44:00.550 --> 00:44:02.925
to get more people into Sahaja Yoga

00:44:02.966 --> 00:44:07.342
in a proper, dynamic way and settle them in Sahaja Yoga.

00:44:07.383 --> 00:44:36.050
May God bless you.

00:44:36.050 --> 00:44:39.467
Before we start the Puja, I really admire the way

00:44:39.467 --> 00:44:42.509
you have created this maya here.

00:44:42.550 --> 00:44:48.800
I hope this will cover the blinding maya

00:44:48.841 --> 00:44:52.133
and put people into their right path.

00:44:52.175 --> 00:44:56.300
I must say I admire it, the way you have done it. It's beautifully done.

00:44:56.342 --> 00:44:59.091
May God bless you.

00:44:59.091 --> 00:46:04.425
One of the names of Devi is also Nirmala, because it means "pure",

00:46:04.467 --> 00:46:09.799
also these days people are talking of Khalsa and Khalistan.

00:46:09.799 --> 00:46:14.300
Khalis means "pure." Khalistan is the place

00:46:14.342 --> 00:46:18.133
where the pure people have to settle down, that is Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:18.175 --> 00:46:24.425
That's what was said that only the Khalis people, means the people who are pure

00:46:24.467 --> 00:46:30.425
have to form Khalistan, not those who are violent or those who are stupid.

00:46:30.467 --> 00:46:36.175
Is meant for the people who are Sahaja Yogis. Was said for the Sahaja Yogis.

00:46:36.217 --> 00:46:43.509
The saints would never tell that those violent people should have their Khalistan.

00:46:43.550 --> 00:46:50.258
So, as they call it "Nirmalites" are the Khalistani people and they are the Khalsas.

00:46:50.258 --> 00:46:56.467
Such a misnomer under the influence of Vishnumaya.
