00:00:07.313 --> 00:00:13.794
So the essence of aesthetics is variety.

00:00:13.874 --> 00:00:17.592
So we have to have Sahaja Yogis of different varieties,

00:00:17.672 --> 00:00:24.697
of different nature, of different
humour, to humour ourselves.

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:28.650
We are not to have everybody just the same.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:36.877
But in the essence of it, all of
them have to love the Mother.

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:41.250
Then the best of yours that you enjoy the most,

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:48.925
not the flowers so much, not the nature so
much, nothing more than other Sahaja Yogis.

00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.201
Once you start enjoying other
Sahaja Yogis and their company,

00:00:53.281 --> 00:00:56.090
then you have achieved it.

00:00:57.124 --> 00:01:03.598
I mean, imagine enjoying every
human being who is a Sahaja Yogi

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:10.838
and their company, then it’s more
than sufficient. What more do you want?

00:01:10.918 --> 00:01:16.605
You don’t enjoy other people, you
don’t enjoy other things so much.

00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:21.780
But if you are in a beautiful
place and beautiful circumstances

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.818
and you are with other Sahaja
Yogis also, then nothing like this.

00:01:27.898 --> 00:01:39.188
It becomes doubly enjoyable, I should say,
and every moment becomes an experience,

00:01:39.268 --> 00:01:44.692
every person becomes an
experience, is like a wave of joy.

00:01:44.772 --> 00:01:51.182
Every person you meet, every collectivity
you meet, every ashram you go to,

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:56.529
it creates a beautiful wave in your heart of joy.

00:01:58.142 --> 00:02:05.245
My joy is silent, but when I meet
somebody, then it shows itself up.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:12.870
It comes up like a wave or sometimes
as you see these drops from the ocean

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.354
breaking on the shores, beautiful
drops. We call them "tushhaar"

00:02:17.434 --> 00:02:21.839
- in Sanskrit language there’s a
beautiful name for that, tushhaar –

00:02:23.025 --> 00:02:31.781
and then the waves go back to your
heart. So beautifully is the relationship

00:02:31.861 --> 00:02:37.253
and you just watch it as a witness and see the joy.

00:02:39.183 --> 00:02:47.083
Then everything melts away,
all your knowledge so-called,

00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:51.939
all your pains, all your troubles, all your past,

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.023
all your future, but you remain
in the presence, in meditation,

00:02:59.103 --> 00:03:03.640
watching all this beautiful happening.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.992
May God all of you understand. May God in all of you

00:03:12.072 --> 00:03:18.512
as Spirit emit that experience
all the time to all of you.

00:03:18.592 --> 00:03:20.344
May God bless you.
