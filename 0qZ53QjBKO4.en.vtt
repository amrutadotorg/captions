07:10.130 --> 07:12.373
Clap like this and will get it.

07:12.373 --> 07:16.832
See Kawaal Clap like this.

10:02.124 --> 10:05.207
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Maata Ki Jai!

10:05.249 --> 10:05.623
Shri Mataji: Great!

10:05.707 --> 10:11.124
Singer: Jai Kara is too short. Let it be Punjabi Jai Kara.

10:11.207 --> 10:15.373
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

10:15.415 --> 10:19.249
Laughter

10:19.249 --> 10:22.790
Singer: One Jai Kara we will make

10:22.790 --> 10:36.540
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

10:36.582 --> 10:40.748
SY: Who will take out such a long breathe?

10:40.790 --> 10:43.124
Singer: Take out your breathe to say Jai for Maa

10:43.165 --> 10:46.373
The breath that Mother has given, keep it on.

10:46.415 --> 10:49.082
Maa gives you breathe, Maa will give you breathe.

10:49.124 --> 10:51.249
You try it and see how far your breath will go

10:51.332 --> 10:51.373
Shri Mataji: Good!

10:51.415 --> 11:06.347
Singer: Say, Adi Shakti Nirmala Mata Ji ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

11:06.372 --> 11:07.372
Shri Mataji: it went on for a pretty long time.

11:07.373 --> 11:12.165
Everybody laughs.

11:12.207 --> 11:13.503
Shri Mataji: You see one thing is there

11:13.528 --> 11:14.832
that Your Sahastrara opens when you clap.

11:14.832 --> 11:18.372
Check it with your hands, because the whole Sahastrara opens

11:18.373 --> 11:20.373
Vibrations improve absolutely.

11:20.373 --> 11:22.373
This is the benefit of clapping

11:22.373 --> 11:24.373
See, immediately the Sahastrara opens.

11:24.373 --> 11:26.373
Sahastrara is in our hands and feet.

11:26.373 --> 11:28.582
But here (Shri Mataji shows on HER palms) when you clap

11:28.707 --> 11:30.498
You are hitting your chakras

11:30.540 --> 11:32.373
Actually, when we clap like this ( Shri Mataji shows on HER palms)

11:32.373 --> 11:34.373
Chakras are surely hit by chakras

11:34.373 --> 11:36.582
Immediately, this Sahastrara opens.

11:36.665 --> 11:38.124
Specially for void

11:38.165 --> 11:39.677
A person who has problem of void,

11:39.702 --> 11:41.785
or have been harmed by some Gurus

11:41.825 --> 11:47.082
should clap their hands rigorously in kawaali

11:47.124 --> 11:52.540
and those who used to be kawaals, used to sing in praise of Gods

11:52.582 --> 11:56.415
For example bhajans, but now they have changed the format of Kawaalis

11:56.456 --> 11:58.415
Earlier ladies would not sing at all

11:58.415 --> 12:01.373
and even if they would sing, they would sing collectively

12:01.415 --> 12:05.623
But now the format of Kawaali is absolutely vulgar

12:08.207 --> 12:12.707
This is not the real format of kawaali.

12:12.707 --> 12:17.249
Amir Khusro Sahib introduced Kawaali.

12:17.415 --> 12:21.665
Amir Khusro Sahab. He was the disciple of Aulia Nizzamudin.

12:21.748 --> 12:26.965
And he in his daily language and daily life

12:26.990 --> 12:29.370
introduced poetry in such a way

12:29.395 --> 12:31.082
For example, Babul Mera Naihar Chuto Jaye,

12:31.124 --> 12:32.040
It has all been written by him.

12:32.372 --> 12:35.832
In daily songs, marriages and all other functions

12:35.957 --> 12:40.207
he has written about Gods in such a way that it cannot be understood

12:40.249 --> 12:41.707
but a person sings in appreciation of Gods.

12:42.082 --> 12:46.373
Very Beautiful! He introduced it.

12:46.373 --> 12:48.373
He introduced that by hitting all it will be okay

12:48.456 --> 12:51.999
He introduced Kawaali.

12:52.082 --> 12:54.197
And it used to be first at their Dargah (Shrine ).

12:54.222 --> 12:55.373
and then at Chishti's

12:55.415 --> 12:59.040
And today a great Kawaal had come there

12:59.082 --> 13:04.249
Most probably named Nusrat Hussain Sahab from Pakistan

13:04.372 --> 13:08.373
As soon as he saw ME, he said, "Mother How are you here?"

13:08.373 --> 13:11.790
In the midst of all he said,"Mother, please sit in the front."

13:11.832 --> 13:16.124
He took ME and made ME to sit in the front seat and started singing.

13:16.165 --> 13:17.124
And said, "Today i am singing in my true form

13:17.124 --> 13:17.515
as you are sitting in front of me."

13:17.540 --> 13:19.373
You see he doesn't even know anything about ME

13:21.040 --> 13:24.165
But he is his disciple.

13:24.291 --> 13:27.207
At Aulia Nizzamudin Sahab's Dargah also

13:27.249 --> 13:29.790
the earning hands reached there too.

13:30.165 --> 13:31.498
In the beginning I said nothing.

13:31.498 --> 13:36.790
I told somebody that this Nizzam Sahab was a self realised soul.

13:36.999 --> 13:38.082
Some people went there

13:38.082 --> 13:40.373
And since that day they started offering money.

13:40.915 --> 13:43.249
His relatives started collecting money there.

13:43.291 --> 13:46.124
Oh! you are sitting at their door, collect something else as well.

13:46.207 --> 13:47.623
He is collecting  the same thing.

13:49.582 --> 13:51.040
Here Nizzamuddin Sahiba

13:51.082 --> 13:53.332
And Chishtis also, they were all Awllias.

13:53.498 --> 13:56.498
And Awlia is the same, who is called Peer

13:56.540 --> 13:59.124
or what we call realized souls.

13:59.165 --> 14:00.291
It is one and the same thing.

14:00.707 --> 14:01.623
There is no difference in that.

14:01.665 --> 14:02.498
It is one and the same thing.

14:02.540 --> 14:05.165
It is only we who quarrel unnecessarily.

14:05.207 --> 14:06.000
Let them do

14:06.040 --> 14:07.748
As many heads they break, is good because it is a nuisance.

14:08.040 --> 14:10.540
Those who are fools, let them break their heads

14:10.707 --> 14:11.999
Later they will all come to their senses.

14:11.999 --> 14:13.650
S.Y: Same thing is going on in Punjab.

14:13.675 --> 14:15.307
Shri Mataji: They are all fools.

14:15.373 --> 14:20.994
Now just tell, Nanak Sahab, He only was Muhammad Sahab

14:21.666 --> 14:23.671
All of them said one thing only

14:23.920 --> 14:26.121
Mohammad Sahab thought that now they have started fighting

14:26.146 --> 14:28.317
as He had come as Nanak Sahab

14:28.900 --> 14:30.877
Worked so hard, did everything

14:30.902 --> 14:33.139
and now see what a show is going on.

14:34.392 --> 14:36.145
They will come to senses.

14:38.024 --> 14:41.152
It is necessary for them to learn a lesson, I think.

14:41.569 --> 14:44.689
Unless fanaticism doesn't get exposed openly

14:44.890 --> 14:46.099
till then it will not be visible.

14:46.124 --> 14:48.868
Hindus must observe it, Muslims must observe it

14:48.930 --> 14:51.142
Sikhs must observe, what a foolishness it is.

14:51.530 --> 14:53.514
They will understand only when they will observe it.

14:53.546 --> 14:55.486
Otherwise, the Rakhshasas will not be visible

14:55.511 --> 14:56.714
and will thrive deep inside

14:57.095 --> 14:59.311
So, what is called starking in the front

14:59.336 --> 15:00.959
It is existing in the forefront

15:00.984 --> 15:03.022
How much foolishness is it!

15:03.047 --> 15:05.874
Where have we landed in the name of religion?

15:05.899 --> 15:07.180
Is it a religion?

15:07.252 --> 15:08.252
Is it God?

15:08.910 --> 15:10.465
One who is the Giver

15:10.490 --> 15:14.841
One who is God Rahim, is Ram, how can He be like that?

15:17.921 --> 15:19.709
There is no comparison between Nanak Sahab and these people.

15:19.734 --> 15:23.162
Among Hindus also there is too much of cruelty

15:23.187 --> 15:23.961
That is why recently

15:23.986 --> 15:27.018
I used MY TEEKA ASTRA (weapon to criticize openly) for the Brahmins.

15:27.043 --> 15:28.635
(UNClEAR)

15:28.660 --> 15:30.496
felt that I was sitting in the slums of Brahmins.

15:30.521 --> 15:32.533
(UNCLEAR)

15:32.558 --> 15:35.451
You have created such a mockery of God's images

15:35.493 --> 15:37.516
have ways and means of earning money.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.889
But now it has its somewhat effect on the people.

15:40.914 --> 15:41.793
It is showing its effect.

15:41.855 --> 15:43.288
It will have to be said!

15:43.313 --> 15:46.042
Otherwise how will Dharma be established?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.430
We have established Vishwa Dharma

15:47.455 --> 15:49.343
all the dharmas will merge into that.

15:49.368 --> 15:51.274
Because all this is Adharam in the name of Dharma.

15:51.320 --> 15:53.123
It is bad name of God.

15:53.151 --> 15:55.942
Whosoever sees it feels what a foolishness it is!

15:55.967 --> 15:58.702
That is why many people have no faith in God.

16:00.504 --> 16:02.096
The same thing happened in Algeria

16:02.121 --> 16:04.113
There the people saw that they are fundamentalists

16:04.138 --> 16:07.374
They are forcing they are very cruel, they are killing everyone

16:07.378 --> 16:10.276
Iraq is killing Iran and vice versa.

16:10.301 --> 16:12.719
They thought that communism is better.

16:12.744 --> 16:16.021
Five hundred people took to communism.

16:16.491 --> 16:19.721
Out of them got influenced by us in London.

16:20.018 --> 16:22.920
He said, God exists, Communism is telling lies.

16:22.945 --> 16:25.425
We have not to be scared of any fundamentalism.

16:25.450 --> 16:27.475
We are standing on our own ideals.

16:27.500 --> 16:29.443
Five hundred people got their realization

16:29.468 --> 16:31.745
came by aeroplane and got their realization.

16:33.671 --> 16:34.656
It will be like that only

16:34.773 --> 16:37.716
Many Sikhs are also there. Many Sikhs had come to Birmingham

16:37.741 --> 16:39.662
They still come here.

16:39.687 --> 16:41.512
Everybody will come to senses.

16:41.537 --> 16:43.872
They see what is it!

16:43.897 --> 16:46.054
Where are they unnecessarily jumping into the sea?

16:46.079 --> 16:47.735
When the talk is going on about God

16:47.760 --> 16:48.746
one should rise towards sky.

16:48.816 --> 16:50.653
All are jumping into the sea

16:50.708 --> 16:52.514
fighting amongst themselves

16:52.539 --> 16:54.062
Is it a joke?

16:54.087 --> 16:56.885
I mean to say the way they are getting agitated like this

16:56.910 --> 16:59.103
and especially those who are

16:59.128 --> 17:02.080
Sikhs, like Maharashtrians

17:02.105 --> 17:02.696
they are in Maharashtra.

17:02.721 --> 17:04.409
They got scared

17:04.434 --> 17:06.057
that they will kill us too.

17:06.164 --> 17:09.185
They are already killing them, they will kill us too.

17:09.210 --> 17:11.588
But now they will be alright.

17:11.613 --> 17:12.641
Let them be sensible.

17:12.666 --> 17:14.236
They have become too much fanatics.

17:14.261 --> 17:15.679
There is a need to be sensible.

17:15.704 --> 17:17.518
Everybody needs to be sensible.

17:24.167 --> 17:25.813
They will be better now.

17:25.838 --> 17:30.429
For some time let them get punished.

17:30.438 --> 17:31.993
No body dies.

17:32.018 --> 17:33.563
Nobody is going to die.

17:33.602 --> 17:34.962
You give up this worry.

17:34.987 --> 17:37.361
This should happen to show it to the world

17:37.438 --> 17:39.236
so that it becomes clear.

17:39.470 --> 17:42.107
Just now I read in the newspaper

17:42.132 --> 17:43.730
a Sikh has been arrested.

17:43.755 --> 17:46.677
He says that all these Sikhs do smuggling.

17:47.621 --> 17:50.117
Binderwallas smuggle drugs.

17:50.142 --> 17:53.132
and i do this work to catch hold of them.

17:53.365 --> 17:56.681
You see, they have been arrested.

17:57.270 --> 17:59.204
Those who talk about God

17:59.229 --> 18:00.628
talk about temples

18:00.653 --> 18:01.899
talk about mosques

18:01.924 --> 18:03.970
what concern they have with smuggling.

18:04.312 --> 18:05.857
It is just a contrast

18:05.882 --> 18:07.416
One is darkness

18:07.441 --> 18:08.434
the other is light.

18:08.459 --> 18:10.400
Both these can never be together.

18:17.263 --> 18:19.978
Can't understand how do people accept it.

18:20.461 --> 18:21.461
This is the situation.

18:24.063 --> 18:25.063
But it is so!

18:25.778 --> 18:26.255
Not only this,

18:26.280 --> 18:28.501
all those who are great Popes

18:28.527 --> 18:31.150
Popes and

18:31.175 --> 18:33.214
others like maphia

18:33.342 --> 18:35.368
Maphia and Pope are just one with each other, do you know?

18:35.439 --> 18:37.059
and they have got one bank

18:37.084 --> 18:40.501
and all these owners of Switzerland banks are great thieves.

18:40.535 --> 18:42.953
Have collected the unauthorized money all over the world

18:43.418 --> 18:44.100
and you will be surprised

18:44.125 --> 18:45.964
the place where our programme was organized

18:46.394 --> 18:47.537
in Calvinist church

18:47.562 --> 18:49.112
just in front of that was the bank

18:49.137 --> 18:50.641
and they were arrested there only.

18:51.822 --> 18:53.541
There only all the three were arrested.

18:53.566 --> 18:55.181
All of them very fraudulent

18:55.643 --> 18:58.225
Maphia, pope and swiss bank

18:59.227 --> 19:00.227
all the three in competition.

19:02.115 --> 19:07.666
most fraudulent had collected and created a problem

19:07.674 --> 19:09.527
are getting exposed, they are getting exposed.

19:09.552 --> 19:11.472
This is the best way now a days

19:11.497 --> 19:12.767
that let all be exposed

19:13.189 --> 19:14.189
and come to an end with that.

19:18.875 --> 19:20.023
In these swiss banks

19:20.048 --> 19:22.172
the money is of the fraudulent of all over the world

19:22.197 --> 19:25.151
roam all over the world with a red cross.

19:25.206 --> 19:28.884
It has the money of people all over the world.

19:30.899 --> 19:33.442
How should such people be recognized?

19:38.134 --> 19:42.622
The question is that these people have settled themselves all over.

19:42.729 --> 19:43.436
And who are these people?

19:43.484 --> 19:46.073
They are from masonic lodge.

19:46.558 --> 19:47.558
They are mesons.

19:48.279 --> 19:50.693
Those who were secretive earlier, they are those thieves.

19:51.225 --> 19:54.330
They thought if you have to steal, better steal something worthwhile.

19:56.564 --> 19:59.773
By secretly participating in masonic lodge

19:59.798 --> 20:00.814
they became secretives

20:00.839 --> 20:03.635
and by mutual help ruined Swiss bank.

20:07.887 --> 20:10.367
This is the situation.

20:10.890 --> 20:12.133
In such a world

20:12.158 --> 20:13.938
if they have to establish Sahajyoga then

20:13.963 --> 20:17.421
with a great effort, set its foundation deep

20:17.446 --> 20:20.294
first settle down their mutual differences and come up.

20:21.010 --> 20:23.263
The greatest thing is to put an end to their mutual differences

20:24.390 --> 20:25.712
have to spread Sahajyoga

20:25.737 --> 20:26.638
all have to do it collectively.

20:28.364 --> 20:29.488
It is not possible without that.

20:29.840 --> 20:31.446
It cannot be done without joint efforts.

20:31.471 --> 20:33.813
We can win only by collective efforts and by nothing else.

20:33.852 --> 20:36.163
Only with the collective efforts we can win over such things.

20:36.188 --> 20:37.491
They are all alone everywhere.

20:38.322 --> 20:40.930
But how can we win is by collectivity.

20:42.193 --> 20:44.990
And in Delhi there is a great need of the growth of collectivity.

20:45.842 --> 20:48.252
Here everyone is Prime Minister of India.

20:48.784 --> 20:51.921
That is a great problem.

20:52.822 --> 20:56.195
But it is good that now a days bhoots are after the Prime Minister.

20:56.220 --> 20:58.006
They will be after you too.

20:58.031 --> 20:59.329
Shri Mataji laughs

20:59.354 --> 21:02.096
If you think that you are Prime Minister

21:02.121 --> 21:04.666
you will have to walk with four Aides.

21:08.373 --> 21:10.518
Singer: We will proceed with Mother
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so!

21:10.543 --> 21:12.355
Shri Mataji: yes, now you sing one more song.

21:12.745 --> 21:16.949
Singer: A sahajyogi proceeds forward with Mother's energy

21:17.005 --> 21:19.188
Doesn't have to be a Prime Minister.

21:19.213 --> 21:20.917
That is what I am telling.

21:20.942 --> 21:25.561
By being in such a falsehood, it is not possible to move smoothly.

21:25.586 --> 21:31.218
By living in simplicity kundalini has no problem.

21:31.336 --> 21:34.129
There should be no crookery in any case

21:34.154 --> 21:36.896
But you see what type of crooks are in the world?

21:36.921 --> 21:38.444
They are dependent on God.

21:38.469 --> 21:41.715
If anyone follows Sahajyoga, then he settles down.

21:41.740 --> 21:44.413
I am not the responsible for that. You are responsible for that.

21:44.640 --> 21:50.217
If you yourself want to go to filth, what can I do?

21:50.877 --> 21:52.985
How long can we stop them?

21:53.010 --> 21:57.147
You take your decision, where to go?

21:57.241 --> 21:59.645
You take decision on the New Year's Day

21:59.670 --> 22:01.952
that we have to follow Sahajyoga only.

22:02.044 --> 22:02.969
We have to follow Sahaj yoga.

22:02.994 --> 22:04.142
What is the meaning of ''Sahaj mein uttarna hai''?

22:04.184 --> 22:06.156
After acquiring your own power

22:06.181 --> 22:10.286
knowing your own glorious tales you have to move forward.

22:10.311 --> 22:11.994
What is so great about it?

22:13.286 --> 22:15.235
Tell ME what is the other way apart from Sahaj?

22:15.260 --> 22:17.486
The rest are all misleading routes.

22:17.511 --> 22:19.510
I can't see any other route.

22:21.295 --> 22:24.340
The path which is going to give you everything is SAHAJ MARG

22:24.365 --> 22:26.700
Then follow that. Leave everything else.

22:30.283 --> 22:33.134
That is why I said there is no need to fast.

22:33.159 --> 22:35.375
Fasted on Karwa Choth

22:35.501 --> 22:36.739
They were ladies of U.P

22:36.764 --> 22:40.584
Are the rest of the ladies bad those who do not keep this fast?

22:40.609 --> 22:42.642
For the time being told her not to keep fast.

22:42.667 --> 22:44.666
They vomitted so much

22:44.691 --> 22:48.375
that next day they stood in front of ME, holding their ears

22:48.395 --> 22:49.570
I asked them,"What happened?"

22:49.664 --> 22:51.233
They said," Mother by mistake we observed the

22:51.258 --> 22:52.757
fast of KARWACHOTH yesterday and fell sick."

22:53.034 --> 22:54.821
I said,"You see I didn't make you fall sick.

22:54.846 --> 22:56.701
I had beforehand told you not to keep the fast on KARWACHOTH."

22:56.766 --> 22:57.914
They said earlier they would not have it like this.

22:57.939 --> 22:59.655
I said, "Earlier you had caught hold of snake in ignorance.

22:59.680 --> 23:01.610
Now don't hold it when you have knowledge."

23:05.602 --> 23:07.679
If you want to fast, do it there is no problem.

23:07.704 --> 23:10.481
But don't do it in the name of God.

23:10.506 --> 23:12.176
You don't gain any thing by defaming HIM.

23:12.808 --> 23:13.759
HE is giving you everything

23:13.798 --> 23:15.937
Even then you want to fast, do so.

23:18.736 --> 23:20.766
So, whatever Mother says

23:20.791 --> 23:23.799
even though you may feel it strange

23:23.824 --> 23:26.905
but try to understand that this is the truth.

23:27.675 --> 23:30.152
This has been going on for the past so many years.

23:30.177 --> 23:31.801
It has no meaning.

23:31.890 --> 23:33.888
If there has been any foolishness going on for the past so many years

23:33.913 --> 23:35.814
are you still going to do this foolishness?

23:35.917 --> 23:37.276
Has it helped you in any way?

23:38.244 --> 23:39.258
Another thing is

23:39.283 --> 23:40.764
as I was telling Dr. Sahab

23:40.789 --> 23:42.817
Everybody says, It has never been so earlier.

23:42.842 --> 23:44.675
If it has not been so, but it will be so someday.

23:44.944 --> 23:47.835
It will take place some day.

23:47.860 --> 23:49.455
Whenever it will take place

23:49.480 --> 23:51.093
it will be said that it didn't happen earlier.

23:51.118 --> 23:52.517
Should it take place just after its birth?

23:52.620 --> 23:54.688
Should it take place just after the world creation?

23:55.720 --> 23:58.080
Such type of arguments go on like this.

23:58.105 --> 24:01.299
Because of that If a person wants to run away from Sahaj yoga

24:01.323 --> 24:04.335
the door is open for him but he who wants to sit

24:04.360 --> 24:05.509
there is a a seat reserved for him.

24:05.535 --> 24:07.857
All of you settle down.

24:07.882 --> 24:09.971
I want all of you to settle down perfectly in Sahajyoga.

24:10.052 --> 24:12.911
This is the first thing. Everything happens later on.

24:15.232 --> 24:16.232
and settle down people.

24:17.686 --> 24:19.742
As you said: Maa you came in the form of flame.

24:19.767 --> 24:21.161
What will flame do single handed?

24:21.186 --> 24:22.717
Many flames are required.

24:22.742 --> 24:24.990
We need many flames from one flame.

24:25.015 --> 24:27.264
Only then there will be light.

24:27.542 --> 24:29.226
Had it been possible by ME alone

24:29.251 --> 24:33.302
Why would I have requested you people to settle down?

24:33.556 --> 24:38.037
One who prays to God for the betterment, move ahead smoothly

24:38.062 --> 24:40.295
You only are on the stage, not I

24:40.320 --> 24:43.729
You are on the stage. The world is watching you.

24:44.021 --> 24:46.880
Understand that the world is watching you, not to ME.

24:47.408 --> 24:51.012
They have taken that out, saying that this is Devi.

24:51.037 --> 24:53.400
I cannot be Devi.

24:53.425 --> 24:56.162
The point is that they have made a Devi

24:56.187 --> 24:58.475
Rest you handle.

25:03.586 --> 25:07.272
Delhiites are otherwise also sitting on the stage on their own.

25:07.281 --> 25:09.445
on the throne

25:09.470 --> 25:12.343
Bakasurs are sitting on the stage.

25:12.442 --> 25:13.790
They are sitting in the gallery.

25:13.815 --> 25:17.811
You are sitting on the threshold of God

25:17.836 --> 25:20.396
You sit there. People will watch you only.

25:20.421 --> 25:24.932
People sitting on the threshold

25:24.957 --> 25:28.047
will watch what are people living in Delhi doing?.

25:28.072 --> 25:33.057
It is a great responsibility.

25:33.082 --> 25:35.380
There is a great responsibility on people living in Delhi.

25:35.405 --> 25:37.709
What do you have to say?

25:37.968 --> 25:43.747
Lekhak ji (writer) Yes, say!

25:43.772 --> 25:47.853
Yes, write down

25:47.878 --> 25:49.473
(UNCLEAR)

25:49.519 --> 25:52.229
It is the best

25:52.301 --> 25:55.146
Deepa didn't come today?

25:55.171 --> 25:56.841
She is in Dharmshala

25:56.929 --> 25:58.509
Shri Mataji: She is in Dharamshala.

25:58.534 --> 26:01.192
S.Y: She is much better.

26:08.365 --> 26:09.365
Yes, you come!

26:12.181 --> 26:13.181
Open it.

26:19.697 --> 26:23.154
Fix it at bottom.

26:23.225 --> 26:37.901
music

26:37.926 --> 26:39.471
Shri Mataji to the singer: Your face has changed.

26:39.496 --> 26:44.221
Singer: Everything has wholly changed.

26:44.364 --> 26:49.361
Shri Mataji to a Sahajyogi: Just see! his face, saintly!

26:49.386 --> 26:55.504
Musician: Yesterday there was a great miracle.

26:55.529 --> 26:59.045
People have defamed me. Tomorrow i will tell on the stage.

26:59.070 --> 27:13.347
Rashtrapati has given me in written, result and certificate (UNCLEAR)

27:13.372 --> 27:17.649
I got President's award, people talked all nonsense.

27:17.674 --> 27:25.650
They are talking like that. They cannot defame MOTHER'S son.

Shri Mataji: Beautiful! You people have started singing in Sanskrit

31:26.368 --> 31:27.609
It is great!

31:27.937 --> 31:41.021
Don't become Pandits now. It is really great!

31:41.101 --> 31:47.192
Actually, voice is vibrating.

31:47.495 --> 31:54.077
Because of the vibrations, it is cooling.

31:54.601 --> 31:58.561
When you sing you feel vibrates, your voice reverberates.

31:58.586 --> 32:00.296
The same is the case with him too.

32:00.321 --> 32:02.452
When he had sung earlier it was not so

32:02.477 --> 32:10.341
but since he is in (Sahaj) his voice vibrates.

32:10.714 --> 32:13.466
It is like a echo

32:14.514 --> 32:20.620
It is called PRATISATH in Sanskrit.

32:20.645 --> 32:26.251
Beautiful! He is doing so great!

32:26.276 --> 32:31.705
Such pronunciation of Sanskrit

32:31.776 --> 32:33.864
I have not heard such pure pronunciation among Punjabis.

32:33.889 --> 32:37.999
I am telling you the truth.

32:38.024 --> 32:40.704
I too have studied in Punjab.

32:40.911 --> 32:43.875
The language of that place is such

32:44.494 --> 32:47.776
And even Hindi speaking people pronounce SPASHT as ASPASHAT

32:48.110 --> 32:52.272
But I have never heard such pure pronunciation in Sanskrit language.

32:52.297 --> 32:54.194
I am telling you the truth. It is great!

32:54.218 --> 32:57.640
It is great! It should be so.

33:03.751 --> 33:10.021
S.Y: Basically, Mother it is the effort of Rajesh.

33:10.148 --> 33:13.988
He has started after coming here only.

33:14.013 --> 33:16.334
(UNCLEAR)

33:16.731 --> 33:19.893
Shri Mataji: Look at Rajesh as well!

33:19.918 --> 33:23.164
Now a days he is studying Gyaneshwari.

33:24.680 --> 33:28.597
S.Y: He is the one who started (UNCLEAR) Last time when he came,

33:28.653 --> 33:31.863
Rustam and he came that was the day this whole started.

33:31.895 --> 33:32.518
Shri Mataji: Oh! Really!

33:32.543 --> 33:33.380
S.Y: About a week ago.

33:33.405 --> 33:38.631
Then started Sanskrit. Rustam didn't know DEVNAGRI LIPI(script)

33:38.671 --> 33:39.540
Can you imagine?

33:39.565 --> 33:42.078
He didn't know Devnagri.

33:42.103 --> 33:45.194
He never studied Devnagri. He studied in English school

33:45.258 --> 33:46.303
then stayed in England.

33:46.328 --> 33:47.869
He didn't know Devnagri.

33:47.894 --> 33:48.779
He studied Sanskrit

33:48.804 --> 33:51.068
and is writing MY names in Sanskrit.

33:51.094 --> 33:53.535
He has already written one thousand names.

33:54.386 --> 33:55.961
S.Y: Has Rustam written?

33:55.986 --> 34:00.371
Shri Mataji: Yes, He has written one thousand names.

34:00.530 --> 34:01.767
S.Y: He is a Sanskrit scholar.

34:01.792 --> 34:03.089
Shri Mataji: He has become a Sanskrit scholar

34:03.137 --> 34:04.137
S.Y: And very inspired.

34:04.225 --> 34:06.613
Shri Mataji: Yes, even Gregoire!

34:06.878 --> 34:11.051
Gregoire has become a Sanskrit scholar.

34:11.815 --> 34:13.672
Absolutely Sanskrit scholar.

34:16.612 --> 34:22.624
How does the result of Sahajyoga come out?

34:22.776 --> 34:24.312
Because one who doesn't know even Devnagri

34:24.344 --> 34:26.479
Gregoire never not even Hindi words

34:26.526 --> 34:28.899
It is worth noticing, how beautifully he writes!

34:30.778 --> 34:33.523
One who didn't know even A,AA,I,EE (Devnagri Script)

34:34.438 --> 34:35.438
How did it happen?

34:35.477 --> 34:38.496
Our Babba doesn't know Urdu at all.

34:38.521 --> 34:39.474
I still know a little bit of it.

34:39.499 --> 34:40.725
not even a little bit of Urdu.

34:40.750 --> 34:44.357
But the poetry he has done in Urdu

34:44.388 --> 34:44.964
You listen to him.

34:44.989 --> 34:47.727
MY brother, he is a Chartered accountant.

34:47.783 --> 34:50.295
He didn't know even the name of poetry, what is poetry

34:50.485 --> 34:53.754
He was just like a stone hearted in this field.

34:53.779 --> 34:56.643
He writes (Poetry) so beautifully, so marvelous.

34:57.902 --> 34:59.695
(UNCLEAR)

34:59.963 --> 35:01.407
He has started writing very deep (poetry)

35:01.828 --> 35:04.167
He has named himself 'Dilosh'

35:04.192 --> 35:05.945
means NIRMAL

35:08.926 --> 35:11.099
named himself, very good (poetry) he writes.

35:11.124 --> 35:15.090
MY brother himself wonders, where do YOU get these words from?

35:15.188 --> 35:15.956
says: i don't know.

35:15.981 --> 35:16.643
says I give him.

35:16.668 --> 35:18.567
I said some words I too don't know.

35:18.592 --> 35:24.675
How does one know? It is so great!

35:24.800 --> 35:26.520
He has started writing very nicely.

35:26.545 --> 35:28.659
It is so surprising how. How does one bloom?

35:28.770 --> 35:31.638
(UNCLEAR) poetry I never expected from him.

35:31.663 --> 35:35.479
He is a Chartered accountant.

35:35.556 --> 35:39.665
Except Math and counting he has heard no other sound.

35:39.690 --> 35:41.483
I don't know from where he got this thing.

35:41.980 --> 35:43.726
And says, i go on writing.

35:43.751 --> 35:45.556
Now he is writing in Marathi.

35:45.581 --> 35:49.336
His Marathi language was so weak, that I used to write his essays.

35:49.387 --> 35:52.552
He is writing in Marathi.

35:52.577 --> 35:55.719
He is writing in Hindi, but out of all, the best he writes in Urdu.

35:56.847 --> 35:58.479
[ SHERO SHAYIRI ] poet's expression in poetic manner

35:58.504 --> 36:00.696
and there are no rhyming words at all.

36:03.022 --> 36:05.780
It should be said that there is actual poetry in him.

36:05.805 --> 36:07.318
Actual poetry!

36:07.517 --> 36:09.841
There is nothing useless

36:09.866 --> 36:10.946
Nothing useless!

36:10.971 --> 36:13.542
Do you see this MILAN KI SHAYIRI (poetry of union) we have got?

36:13.567 --> 36:16.499
The earlier poetry was all about gloominess

36:16.524 --> 36:17.925
VIRAH KI SHAYIRI [poetry of separation]

36:17.950 --> 36:19.349
Now it is poetry of union.

36:19.878 --> 36:22.615
You set it in his song

36:23.424 --> 36:26.011
There are so many

36:26.442 --> 36:29.956
but they were not so popular.

36:35.172 --> 36:37.606
S.Y: It is coming right from the heart.

36:37.631 --> 36:39.108
He is writing right from the heart.

36:40.003 --> 36:40.500
Shri Mataji saying about HER brother:

36:40.627 --> 36:43.498
It is remarkable for him to write poetry.

36:43.523 --> 36:46.640
I know he is conditioning poetry very well.

36:46.663 --> 36:49.961
Because of Marathi he had little difficulty

36:49.986 --> 36:52.218
I used to sit with him to teach him poetry.

36:52.243 --> 36:55.819
I would tell him that by telling you, I will lose my poetry.

36:55.844 --> 36:57.562
It doesn't enter even your head.

36:57.618 --> 37:00.476
He would ask: Why do they write?

37:00.501 --> 37:02.251
Why don't they write in a straight forward manner?

37:02.276 --> 37:05.279
writing about moon and this and that in a twisted manner

37:05.305 --> 37:06.316
it is better to say

37:06.340 --> 37:09.648
it seems (UNCLEAR)

37:09.673 --> 37:10.851
When he was young

37:10.876 --> 37:12.400
when he was in Matric

37:12.479 --> 37:14.919
(UNCLEAR)

37:14.944 --> 37:17.195
Would say why did they need to write all this?

37:17.220 --> 37:18.824
It has caused my headache.

37:18.849 --> 37:21.210
If one has to learn this Marathi language

37:21.235 --> 37:21.959
it is a great headache.

37:21.984 --> 37:22.803
I would tell him don't learn Marathi

37:22.828 --> 37:24.371
He would say it is compulsory, what to do?

37:24.396 --> 37:27.088
Such was his condition.

37:27.502 --> 37:30.461
In Marathi he would just pass or fail.

37:31.371 --> 37:32.850
He is good at Mathematics.

37:32.875 --> 37:34.764
But I could not understand

37:34.789 --> 37:37.232
from where this new flower has bloomed.

37:37.286 --> 37:41.408
It happened like this that somewhere

37:41.433 --> 37:46.024
you can say for example that a lotus has bloomed out of a rose

37:46.049 --> 37:51.442
(UNCLEAR)

37:51.467 --> 37:56.908
It is like that, can't understand anything

37:56.933 --> 38:00.065
But it means, what an unusual, strange and

38:00.090 --> 38:02.244
an unprecedented event is going on.

38:02.268 --> 38:04.605
but like this something must come out of everybody.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.166
some miracles should take place, then it will be recognized.

38:07.912 --> 38:10.284
He (singer) is also saying that he will tell some miracle

38:10.309 --> 38:11.945
A great miracle he has come across.

38:11.970 --> 38:14.412
S.Y: Yes, really!

38:14.437 --> 38:16.048
Shri Mataji: What you are saying

38:16.073 --> 38:18.644
the reason for that is only that you are NISHKALANK (pure)

38:18.824 --> 38:20.841
Nobody can disgrace you!

38:20.866 --> 38:24.396
If somebody tries, he cannot disgrace you.

38:24.476 --> 38:29.586
Nobody can disgrace you, even a little bit

38:29.611 --> 38:32.420
Even if you think that this person is disgracing you

38:32.445 --> 38:35.723
You will see that this disgrace will be on his face.

38:38.553 --> 38:41.851
In Illustrated Weekly Rajneesh sent a woman

38:41.876 --> 38:44.181
bribed her, to interview ME.

38:44.205 --> 38:46.765
and made a third Muslim lady to write

38:46.790 --> 38:48.712
and in that some wrong statements were

38:48.737 --> 38:51.327
that SHE is such

38:51.352 --> 38:55.667
HER ways are such that SHE mesmerizes. All nonsense.

38:55.691 --> 38:57.249
My husband got very angry.

38:57.274 --> 38:59.590
Especially, my brother took a dagger.

38:59.616 --> 39:02.234
Both of them said, "Now we have to drag them to the court."

39:02.259 --> 39:04.073
I told them, I am not going to the court.

39:04.098 --> 39:06.109
If you want to put up a case, you go, I am not going to the court.

39:06.181 --> 39:07.185
(UNCLEAR)

39:07.210 --> 39:08.623
I asked them what will you do?

39:08.649 --> 39:10.929
There in London people told them

39:10.954 --> 39:13.354
that they should put up a case for ten lakhs.

39:13.629 --> 39:14.863
I said, " I won't go to the court."

39:14.895 --> 39:16.641
You do whatever you want to do.

39:16.666 --> 39:17.895
It is not going to pay you any dividend.

39:17.920 --> 39:19.038
I made them to understand a lot.

39:19.063 --> 39:21.760
I told Rajesh to talk to them.

39:21.785 --> 39:23.803
Tell them to ask for forgiveness

39:23.828 --> 39:25.502
so that this matter will be over.

39:25.527 --> 39:27.654
I don't like this court business.

39:28.230 --> 39:30.086
When nobody came to any agreement

39:30.111 --> 39:33.202
The Illustrated Weekly came to closure for six months.

39:33.266 --> 39:35.520
And they had a loss in terms of Crores.

39:40.734 --> 39:45.494
Then their employees went on a strike.

39:46.186 --> 39:49.345
Then they sent a message.

39:49.370 --> 39:52.500
They are saying why you had written against our Mataji

39:52.525 --> 39:53.769
we will go on strike.

39:53.794 --> 39:55.516
I said that they have written long back.

39:55.541 --> 39:57.459
Why are you going on a strike now?

39:57.568 --> 40:00.028
Already they have been punished

40:00.053 --> 40:02.561
But they won't change.

40:03.183 --> 40:06.339
You have to set right first of all, newspaper agencies.

40:06.694 --> 40:09.384
Now you tell ME what is the need to write what Rajneesh is saying?

40:09.805 --> 40:14.058
Now a days it is Ravan UVACHA (what did Ravana say?)

40:14.083 --> 40:17.326
S.Y: That is a fact.

40:17.351 --> 40:20.199
Shri Mataji: This is the Geeta of modern times.

40:20.569 --> 40:22.347
What useless he is talking?

40:22.372 --> 40:23.871
They get a lot of pleasure by publishing it.

40:23.896 --> 40:25.164
Don't know why?

40:25.599 --> 40:27.444
And now a days he is in Goa.

40:27.469 --> 40:29.429
Now a days we can see some more people.

40:29.454 --> 40:31.020
As bed bugs multiply

40:31.045 --> 40:34.697
so can be seen two to four such people in Poona.

40:34.906 --> 40:36.170
They will all be taken into account.

40:36.195 --> 40:39.051
They will surely reach Poona.

40:39.076 --> 40:41.389
Poona!

40:41.414 --> 40:44.675
They are coming out at wrong place.

40:46.302 --> 40:47.240
All this

40:47.265 --> 40:48.772
Their techniques are like

40:48.797 --> 40:51.480
it appears to be like a group

40:51.949 --> 40:53.596
They help each other.

40:53.621 --> 40:55.544
We too should have our strong group.

40:55.569 --> 40:57.645
Question doesn't arise that anybody can touch you!

40:57.670 --> 40:58.972
We should live like this.

40:59.280 --> 41:00.571
We are all one.

41:00.596 --> 41:01.563
We should have one aim.

41:01.588 --> 41:03.347
We should know this aim.

41:03.372 --> 41:06.823
Then you will enjoy your dividends yourself.

41:07.584 --> 41:11.437
But when we don't know that aim, we face problems.

41:14.158 --> 41:15.249
We have come to Delhi.

41:15.274 --> 41:17.046
We have to do something or the other here.

41:17.071 --> 41:18.461
It is New Year!

41:18.486 --> 41:21.115
You do whatever you desire.

41:21.141 --> 41:22.941
In the evening we have pujan

41:22.966 --> 41:24.957
We will see then.

41:24.982 --> 41:29.158
But all these desires should be for the betterment of everyone.

41:30.185 --> 41:32.926
Not for yourself, I take care of you.

41:32.951 --> 41:35.788
There is no worry about you. It should for everyone.

41:35.916 --> 41:37.372
It should be for the group.

41:37.397 --> 41:38.762
It should be for others.

41:38.787 --> 41:39.898
Not for yourself.

41:39.923 --> 41:41.692
You for yourself have (surrendered to ME)

41:41.717 --> 41:44.808
You said that you have surrendered yourself to ME

41:44.872 --> 41:48.084
I am already managing you.

41:51.410 --> 41:53.720
You have to take care of the whole world.

41:53.745 --> 41:57.517
Specially, We have to take care of Delhi.

41:58.840 --> 42:01.279
Is it okay!
