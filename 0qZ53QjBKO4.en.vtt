singer: Clap for one verse (Chand)

00:07:09.373 --> 00:07:10.105
Shri Mataji: Clap like this.

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.373
Clap like this and will get it.

00:07:12.373 --> 00:07:16.832

Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Maata Ki Jai!

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:05.623
Shri Mataji: Great!

00:10:05.707 --> 00:10:11.124
Singer: Jai Kara is too short. Let it be Punjabi Jai Kara.

00:10:11.207 --> 00:10:15.373
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

00:10:15.415 --> 00:10:19.249
Laughter

00:10:19.249 --> 00:10:22.790
Singer: One Jai Kara we will make

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:36.540
Bolo Adi Shakti Nirmala Mataji Ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

00:10:36.582 --> 00:10:40.748
SY: Who will take out such a long breathe?

00:10:40.790 --> 00:10:43.124
Singer: Take out your breathe to say Jai for Maa

00:10:43.165 --> 00:10:46.373
The breath that Mother has given, keep it on.

00:10:46.415 --> 00:10:49.082
Maa gives you breathe, Maa will give you breathe.

00:10:49.124 --> 00:10:51.249
You try it and see how far your breath will go

00:10:51.332 --> 00:10:51.373
Shri Mataji: Good!

00:10:51.415 --> 00:11:06.347
Singer: Say, Adi Shakti Nirmala Mata Ji ki Jaiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii

00:11:06.372 --> 00:11:07.372
Shri Mataji: it went on for a pretty long time.

00:11:07.373 --> 00:11:12.165
Everybody laughs.

00:11:12.207 --> 00:11:13.503
Shri Mataji: You see one thing is there

00:11:13.528 --> 00:11:14.832
that Your Sahastrara opens when you clap.

00:11:14.832 --> 00:11:18.372
Check it with your hands, because the whole Sahastrara opens

00:11:18.373 --> 00:11:20.373
Vibrations improve absolutely.

00:11:20.373 --> 00:11:22.373
This is the benefit of clapping

00:11:22.373 --> 00:11:24.373
See, immediately the Sahastrara opens.

00:11:24.373 --> 00:11:26.373
Sahastrara is in our hands and feet.

00:11:26.373 --> 00:11:28.582
But here (Shri Mataji shows on HER palms) when you clap

00:11:28.707 --> 00:11:30.498
You are hitting your chakras

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.373
Actually, when we clap like this ( Shri Mataji shows on HER palms)

00:11:32.373 --> 00:11:34.373
Chakras are surely hit by chakras

00:11:34.373 --> 00:11:36.582
Immediately, this Sahastrara opens.

00:11:36.665 --> 00:11:38.124
Specially for void

00:11:38.165 --> 00:11:39.677
A person who has problem of void,

00:11:39.702 --> 00:11:41.785
or have been harmed by some Gurus

00:11:41.825 --> 00:11:47.082
should clap their hands rigorously in kawaali

00:11:47.124 --> 00:11:52.540
and those who used to be kawaals, used to sing in praise of Gods

00:11:52.582 --> 00:11:56.415
For example bhajans, but now they have changed the format of Kawaalis

00:11:56.456 --> 00:11:58.415
Earlier ladies would not sing at all

00:11:58.415 --> 00:12:01.373
and even if they would sing, they would sing collectively

00:12:01.415 --> 00:12:05.623
But now the format of Kawaali is absolutely vulgar

00:12:08.207 --> 00:12:12.707
This is not the real format of kawaali.

00:12:12.707 --> 00:12:17.249
Amir Khusro Sahib introduced Kawaali.

00:12:17.415 --> 00:12:21.665
Amir Khusro Sahab. He was the disciple of Aulia Nizzamudin.

00:12:21.748 --> 00:12:26.965
And he in his daily language and daily life

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:29.370
introduced poetry in such a way

00:12:29.395 --> 00:12:31.082
For example, Babul Mera Naihar Chuto Jaye,

00:12:31.124 --> 00:12:32.040
It has all been written by him.

00:12:32.372 --> 00:12:35.832
In daily songs, marriages and all other functions

00:12:35.957 --> 00:12:40.207
he has written about Gods in such a way that it cannot be understood

00:12:40.249 --> 00:12:41.707
but a person sings in appreciation of Gods.

00:12:42.082 --> 00:12:46.373
Very Beautiful! He introduced it.

00:12:46.373 --> 00:12:48.373
He introduced that by hitting all it will be okay

00:12:48.456 --> 00:12:51.999
He introduced Kawaali.

00:12:52.082 --> 00:12:54.197
And it used to be first at their Dargah (Shrine ).

00:12:54.222 --> 00:12:55.373
and then at Chishti's

00:12:55.415 --> 00:12:59.040
And today a great Kawaal had come there

00:12:59.082 --> 00:13:04.249
Most probably named Nusrat Hussain Sahab from Pakistan

00:13:04.372 --> 00:13:08.373
As soon as he saw ME, he said, "Mother How are you here?"

00:13:08.373 --> 00:13:11.790
In the midst of all he said,"Mother, please sit in the front."

00:13:11.832 --> 00:13:16.124
He took ME and made ME to sit in the front seat and started singing.

00:13:16.165 --> 00:13:17.124
And said, "Today i am singing in my true form

00:13:17.124 --> 00:13:17.515
as you are sitting in front of me."

00:13:17.540 --> 00:13:19.373
You see he doesn't even know anything about ME

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.165
But he is his disciple.

00:13:24.291 --> 00:13:27.207
At Aulia Nizzamudin Sahab's Dargah also

00:13:27.249 --> 00:13:29.790
the earning hands reached there too.

00:13:30.165 --> 00:13:31.498
In the beginning I said nothing.

00:13:31.498 --> 00:13:36.790
I told somebody that this Nizzam Sahab was a self realised soul.

00:13:36.999 --> 00:13:38.082
Some people went there

00:13:38.082 --> 00:13:40.373
And since that day they started offering money.

00:13:40.915 --> 00:13:43.249
His relatives started collecting money there.

00:13:43.291 --> 00:13:46.124
Oh! you are sitting at their door, collect something else as well.

00:13:46.207 --> 00:13:47.623
He is collecting  the same thing.

00:13:49.582 --> 00:13:51.040
Here Nizzamuddin Sahiba

00:13:51.082 --> 00:13:53.332
And Chishtis also, they were all Awllias.

00:13:53.498 --> 00:13:56.498
And Awlia is the same, who is called Peer

00:13:56.540 --> 00:13:59.124
or what we call realized souls.

00:13:59.165 --> 00:14:00.291
It is one and the same thing.

00:14:00.707 --> 00:14:01.623
There is no difference in that.

00:14:01.665 --> 00:14:02.498
It is one and the same thing.

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:05.165
It is only we who quarrel unnecessarily.

00:14:05.207 --> 00:14:06.000
Let them do

00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:07.748
As many heads they break, is good because it is a nuisance.

00:14:08.040 --> 00:14:10.540
Those who are fools, let them break their heads

00:14:10.707 --> 00:14:11.999
Later they will all come to their senses.

00:14:11.999 --> 00:14:13.650
S.Y: Same thing is going on in Punjab.

00:14:13.675 --> 00:14:15.307
Shri Mataji: They are all fools.

00:14:15.373 --> 00:14:20.994
Now just tell, Nanak Sahab, He only was Muhammad Sahab

00:14:21.666 --> 00:14:23.671
All of them said one thing only

00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:26.121
Mohammad Sahab thought that now they have started fighting

00:14:26.146 --> 00:14:28.317
as He had come as Nanak Sahab

00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:30.877
Worked so hard, did everything

00:14:30.902 --> 00:14:33.139
and now see what a show is going on.

00:14:34.392 --> 00:14:36.145
They will come to senses.

00:14:38.024 --> 00:14:41.152
It is necessary for them to learn a lesson, I think.

00:14:41.569 --> 00:14:44.689
Unless fanaticism doesn't get exposed openly

00:14:44.890 --> 00:14:46.099
till then it will not be visible.

00:14:46.124 --> 00:14:48.868
Hindus must observe it, Muslims must observe it

00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:51.142
Sikhs must observe, what a foolishness it is.

00:14:51.530 --> 00:14:53.514
They will understand only when they will observe it.

00:14:53.546 --> 00:14:55.486
Otherwise, the Rakhshasas will not be visible

00:14:55.511 --> 00:14:56.714
and will thrive deep inside

00:14:57.095 --> 00:14:59.311
So, what is called starking in the front

00:14:59.336 --> 00:15:00.959
It is existing in the forefront

00:15:00.984 --> 00:15:03.022
How much foolishness is it!

00:15:03.047 --> 00:15:05.874
Where have we landed in the name of religion?

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:07.180
Is it a religion?

00:15:07.252 --> 00:15:08.252
Is it God?

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.465
One who is the Giver

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:14.841
One who is God Rahim, is Ram, how can He be like that?

00:15:17.921 --> 00:15:19.709
There is no comparison between Nanak Sahab and these people.

00:15:19.734 --> 00:15:23.162
Among Hindus also there is too much of cruelty

00:15:23.187 --> 00:15:23.961
That is why recently

00:15:23.986 --> 00:15:27.018
I used MY TEEKA ASTRA (weapon to criticize openly) for the Brahmins.

00:15:27.043 --> 00:15:28.635
(UNClEAR)

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:30.496
felt that I was sitting in the slums of Brahmins.

00:15:30.521 --> 00:15:32.533
(UNCLEAR)

00:15:32.558 --> 00:15:35.451
You have created such a mockery of God's images

00:15:35.493 --> 00:15:37.516
have ways and means of earning money.

00:15:38.870 --> 00:15:40.889
But now it has its somewhat effect on the people.

00:15:40.914 --> 00:15:41.793
It is showing its effect.

00:15:41.855 --> 00:15:43.288
It will have to be said!

00:15:43.313 --> 00:15:46.042
Otherwise how will Dharma be established?

00:15:46.070 --> 00:15:47.430
We have established Vishwa Dharma

00:15:47.455 --> 00:15:49.343
all the dharmas will merge into that.

00:15:49.368 --> 00:15:51.274
Because all this is Adharam in the name of Dharma.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.123
It is bad name of God.

00:15:53.151 --> 00:15:55.942
Whosoever sees it feels what a foolishness it is!

00:15:55.967 --> 00:15:58.702
That is why many people have no faith in God.

00:16:00.504 --> 00:16:02.096
The same thing happened in Algeria

00:16:02.121 --> 00:16:04.113
There the people saw that they are fundamentalists

00:16:04.138 --> 00:16:07.374
They are forcing they are very cruel, they are killing everyone

00:16:07.378 --> 00:16:10.276
Iraq is killing Iran and vice versa.

00:16:10.301 --> 00:16:12.719
They thought that communism is better.

00:16:12.744 --> 00:16:16.021
Five hundred people took to communism.

00:16:16.491 --> 00:16:19.721
Out of them got influenced by us in London.

00:16:20.018 --> 00:16:22.920
He said, God exists, Communism is telling lies.

00:16:22.945 --> 00:16:25.425
We have not to be scared of any fundamentalism.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:27.475
We are standing on our own ideals.

00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.443
Five hundred people got their realization

00:16:29.468 --> 00:16:31.745
came by aeroplane and got their realization.

00:16:33.671 --> 00:16:34.656
It will be like that only

00:16:34.773 --> 00:16:37.716
Many Sikhs are also there. Many Sikhs had come to Birmingham

00:16:37.741 --> 00:16:39.662
They still come here.

00:16:39.687 --> 00:16:41.512
Everybody will come to senses.

00:16:41.537 --> 00:16:43.872
They see what is it!

00:16:43.897 --> 00:16:46.054
Where are they unnecessarily jumping into the sea?

00:16:46.079 --> 00:16:47.735
When the talk is going on about God

00:16:47.760 --> 00:16:48.746
one should rise towards sky.

00:16:48.816 --> 00:16:50.653
All are jumping into the sea

00:16:50.708 --> 00:16:52.514
fighting amongst themselves

00:16:52.539 --> 00:16:54.062
Is it a joke?

00:16:54.087 --> 00:16:56.885
I mean to say the way they are getting agitated like this

00:16:56.910 --> 00:16:59.103
and especially those who are

00:16:59.128 --> 00:17:02.080
Sikhs, like Maharashtrians

00:17:02.105 --> 00:17:02.696
they are in Maharashtra.

00:17:02.721 --> 00:17:04.409
They got scared

00:17:04.434 --> 00:17:06.057
that they will kill us too.

00:17:06.164 --> 00:17:09.185
They are already killing them, they will kill us too.

00:17:09.210 --> 00:17:11.588
But now they will be alright.

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:12.641
Let them be sensible.

00:17:12.666 --> 00:17:14.236
They have become too much fanatics.

00:17:14.261 --> 00:17:15.679
There is a need to be sensible.

00:17:15.704 --> 00:17:17.518
Everybody needs to be sensible.

00:17:24.167 --> 00:17:25.813
They will be better now.

00:17:25.838 --> 00:17:30.429
For some time let them get punished.

00:17:30.438 --> 00:17:31.993
No body dies.

00:17:32.018 --> 00:17:33.563
Nobody is going to die.

00:17:33.602 --> 00:17:34.962
You give up this worry.

00:17:34.987 --> 00:17:37.361
This should happen to show it to the world

00:17:37.438 --> 00:17:39.236
so that it becomes clear.

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:42.107
Just now I read in the newspaper

00:17:42.132 --> 00:17:43.730
a Sikh has been arrested.

00:17:43.755 --> 00:17:46.677
He says that all these Sikhs do smuggling.

00:17:47.621 --> 00:17:50.117
Binderwallas smuggle drugs.

00:17:50.142 --> 00:17:53.132
and i do this work to catch hold of them.

00:17:53.365 --> 00:17:56.681
You see, they have been arrested.

00:17:57.270 --> 00:17:59.204
Those who talk about God

00:17:59.229 --> 00:18:00.628
talk about temples

00:18:00.653 --> 00:18:01.899
talk about mosques

00:18:01.924 --> 00:18:03.970
what concern they have with smuggling.

00:18:04.312 --> 00:18:05.857
It is just a contrast

00:18:05.882 --> 00:18:07.416
One is darkness

00:18:07.441 --> 00:18:08.434
the other is light.

00:18:08.459 --> 00:18:10.400
Both these can never be together.

00:18:17.263 --> 00:18:19.978
Can't understand how do people accept it.

00:18:20.461 --> 00:18:21.461
This is the situation.

00:18:24.063 --> 00:18:25.063
But it is so!

00:18:25.778 --> 00:18:26.255
Not only this,

00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:28.501
all those who are great Popes

00:18:28.527 --> 00:18:31.150
Popes and

00:18:31.175 --> 00:18:33.214
others like maphia

00:18:33.342 --> 00:18:35.368
Maphia and Pope are just one with each other, do you know?

00:18:35.439 --> 00:18:37.059
and they have got one bank

00:18:37.084 --> 00:18:40.501
and all these owners of Switzerland banks are great thieves.

00:18:40.535 --> 00:18:42.953
Have collected the unauthorized money all over the world

00:18:43.418 --> 00:18:44.100
and you will be surprised

00:18:44.125 --> 00:18:45.964
the place where our programme was organized

00:18:46.394 --> 00:18:47.537
in Calvinist church

00:18:47.562 --> 00:18:49.112
just in front of that was the bank

00:18:49.137 --> 00:18:50.641
and they were arrested there only.

00:18:51.822 --> 00:18:53.541
There only all the three were arrested.

00:18:53.566 --> 00:18:55.181
All of them very fraudulent

00:18:55.643 --> 00:18:58.225
Maphia, pope and swiss bank

00:18:59.227 --> 00:19:00.227
all the three in competition.

00:19:02.115 --> 00:19:07.666
most fraudulent had collected and created a problem

00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:09.527
are getting exposed, they are getting exposed.

00:19:09.552 --> 00:19:11.472
This is the best way now a days

00:19:11.497 --> 00:19:12.767
that let all be exposed

00:19:13.189 --> 00:19:14.189
and come to an end with that.

00:19:18.875 --> 00:19:20.023
In these swiss banks

00:19:20.048 --> 00:19:22.172
the money is of the fraudulent of all over the world

00:19:22.197 --> 00:19:25.151
roam all over the world with a red cross.

00:19:25.206 --> 00:19:28.884
It has the money of people all over the world.

00:19:30.899 --> 00:19:33.442
How should such people be recognized?

00:19:38.134 --> 00:19:42.622
The question is that these people have settled themselves all over.

00:19:42.729 --> 00:19:43.436
And who are these people?

00:19:43.484 --> 00:19:46.073
They are from masonic lodge.

00:19:46.558 --> 00:19:47.558
They are mesons.

00:19:48.279 --> 00:19:50.693
Those who were secretive earlier, they are those thieves.

00:19:51.225 --> 00:19:54.330
They thought if you have to steal, better steal something worthwhile.

00:19:56.564 --> 00:19:59.773
By secretly participating in masonic lodge

00:19:59.798 --> 00:20:00.814
they became secretives

00:20:00.839 --> 00:20:03.635
and by mutual help ruined Swiss bank.

00:20:07.887 --> 00:20:10.367
This is the situation.

00:20:10.890 --> 00:20:12.133
In such a world

00:20:12.158 --> 00:20:13.938
if they have to establish Sahajyoga then

00:20:13.963 --> 00:20:17.421
with a great effort, set its foundation deep

00:20:17.446 --> 00:20:20.294
first settle down their mutual differences and come up.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:23.263
The greatest thing is to put an end to their mutual differences

00:20:24.390 --> 00:20:25.712
have to spread Sahajyoga

00:20:25.737 --> 00:20:26.638
all have to do it collectively.

00:20:28.364 --> 00:20:29.488
It is not possible without that.

00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:31.446
It cannot be done without joint efforts.

00:20:31.471 --> 00:20:33.813
We can win only by collective efforts and by nothing else.

00:20:33.852 --> 00:20:36.163
Only with the collective efforts we can win over such things.

00:20:36.188 --> 00:20:37.491
They are all alone everywhere.

00:20:38.322 --> 00:20:40.930
But how can we win is by collectivity.

00:20:42.193 --> 00:20:44.990
And in Delhi there is a great need of the growth of collectivity.

00:20:45.842 --> 00:20:48.252
Here everyone is Prime Minister of India.

00:20:48.784 --> 00:20:51.921
That is a great problem.

00:20:52.822 --> 00:20:56.195
But it is good that now a days bhoots are after the Prime Minister.

00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.006
They will be after you too.

00:20:58.031 --> 00:20:59.329
Shri Mataji laughs

00:20:59.354 --> 00:21:02.096
If you think that you are Prime Minister

00:21:02.121 --> 00:21:04.666
you will have to walk with four Aides.

00:21:08.373 --> 00:21:10.518
Singer: We will proceed with Mother
Shri Mataji: Yes, it is so!

00:21:10.543 --> 00:21:12.355
Shri Mataji: yes, now you sing one more song.

00:21:12.745 --> 00:21:16.949
Singer: A sahajyogi proceeds forward with Mother's energy

00:21:17.005 --> 00:21:19.188
Doesn't have to be a Prime Minister.

00:21:19.213 --> 00:21:20.917
That is what I am telling.

00:21:20.942 --> 00:21:25.561
By being in such a falsehood, it is not possible to move smoothly.

00:21:25.586 --> 00:21:31.218
By living in simplicity kundalini has no problem.

00:21:31.336 --> 00:21:34.129
There should be no crookery in any case

00:21:34.154 --> 00:21:36.896
But you see what type of crooks are in the world?

00:21:36.921 --> 00:21:38.444
They are dependent on God.

00:21:38.469 --> 00:21:41.715
If anyone follows Sahajyoga, then he settles down.

00:21:41.740 --> 00:21:44.413
I am not the responsible for that. You are responsible for that.

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:50.217
If you yourself want to go to filth, what can I do?

00:21:50.877 --> 00:21:52.985
How long can we stop them?

00:21:53.010 --> 00:21:57.147
You take your decision, where to go?

00:21:57.241 --> 00:21:59.645
You take decision on the New Year's Day

00:21:59.670 --> 00:22:01.952
that we have to follow Sahajyoga only.

00:22:02.044 --> 00:22:02.969
We have to follow Sahaj yoga.

00:22:02.994 --> 00:22:04.142
What is the meaning of ''Sahaj mein uttarna hai''?

00:22:04.184 --> 00:22:06.156
After acquiring your own power

00:22:06.181 --> 00:22:10.286
knowing your own glorious tales you have to move forward.

00:22:10.311 --> 00:22:11.994
What is so great about it?

00:22:13.286 --> 00:22:15.235
Tell ME what is the other way apart from Sahaj?

00:22:15.260 --> 00:22:17.486
The rest are all misleading routes.

00:22:17.511 --> 00:22:19.510
I can't see any other route.

00:22:21.295 --> 00:22:24.340
The path which is going to give you everything is SAHAJ MARG

00:22:24.365 --> 00:22:26.700
Then follow that. Leave everything else.

00:22:30.283 --> 00:22:33.134
That is why I said there is no need to fast.

00:22:33.159 --> 00:22:35.375
Fasted on Karwa Choth

00:22:35.501 --> 00:22:36.739
They were ladies of U.P

00:22:36.764 --> 00:22:40.584
Are the rest of the ladies bad those who do not keep this fast?

00:22:40.609 --> 00:22:42.642
For the time being told her not to keep fast.

00:22:42.667 --> 00:22:44.666
They vomitted so much

00:22:44.691 --> 00:22:48.375
that next day they stood in front of ME, holding their ears

00:22:48.395 --> 00:22:49.570
I asked them,"What happened?"

00:22:49.664 --> 00:22:51.233
They said," Mother by mistake we observed the

00:22:51.258 --> 00:22:52.757
fast of KARWACHOTH yesterday and fell sick."

00:22:53.034 --> 00:22:54.821
I said,"You see I didn't make you fall sick.

00:22:54.846 --> 00:22:56.701
I had beforehand told you not to keep the fast on KARWACHOTH."

00:22:56.766 --> 00:22:57.914
They said earlier they would not have it like this.

00:22:57.939 --> 00:22:59.655
I said, "Earlier you had caught hold of snake in ignorance.

00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:01.610
Now don't hold it when you have knowledge."

00:23:05.602 --> 00:23:07.679
If you want to fast, do it there is no problem.

00:23:07.704 --> 00:23:10.481
But don't do it in the name of God.

00:23:10.506 --> 00:23:12.176
You don't gain any thing by defaming HIM.

00:23:12.808 --> 00:23:13.759
HE is giving you everything

00:23:13.798 --> 00:23:15.937
Even then you want to fast, do so.

00:23:18.736 --> 00:23:20.766
So, whatever Mother says

00:23:20.791 --> 00:23:23.799
even though you may feel it strange

00:23:23.824 --> 00:23:26.905
but try to understand that this is the truth.

00:23:27.675 --> 00:23:30.152
This has been going on for the past so many years.

00:23:30.177 --> 00:23:31.801
It has no meaning.

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:33.888
If there has been any foolishness going on for the past so many years

00:23:33.913 --> 00:23:35.814
are you still going to do this foolishness?

00:23:35.917 --> 00:23:37.276
Has it helped you in any way?

00:23:38.244 --> 00:23:39.258
Another thing is

00:23:39.283 --> 00:23:40.764
as I was telling Dr. Sahab

00:23:40.789 --> 00:23:42.817
Everybody says, It has never been so earlier.

00:23:42.842 --> 00:23:44.675
If it has not been so, but it will be so someday.

00:23:44.944 --> 00:23:47.835
It will take place some day.

00:23:47.860 --> 00:23:49.455
Whenever it will take place

00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:51.093
it will be said that it didn't happen earlier.

00:23:51.118 --> 00:23:52.517
Should it take place just after its birth?

00:23:52.620 --> 00:23:54.688
Should it take place just after the world creation?

00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.080
Such type of arguments go on like this.

00:23:58.105 --> 00:24:01.299
Because of that If a person wants to run away from Sahaj yoga

00:24:01.323 --> 00:24:04.335
the door is open for him but he who wants to sit

00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:05.509
there is a a seat reserved for him.

00:24:05.535 --> 00:24:07.857
All of you settle down.

00:24:07.882 --> 00:24:09.971
I want all of you to settle down perfectly in Sahajyoga.

00:24:10.052 --> 00:24:12.911
This is the first thing. Everything happens later on.

00:24:15.232 --> 00:24:16.232
and settle down people.

00:24:17.686 --> 00:24:19.742
As you said: Maa you came in the form of flame.

00:24:19.767 --> 00:24:21.161
What will flame do single handed?

00:24:21.186 --> 00:24:22.717
Many flames are required.

00:24:22.742 --> 00:24:24.990
We need many flames from one flame.

00:24:25.015 --> 00:24:27.264
Only then there will be light.

00:24:27.542 --> 00:24:29.226
Had it been possible by ME alone

00:24:29.251 --> 00:24:33.302
Why would I have requested you people to settle down?

00:24:33.556 --> 00:24:38.037
One who prays to God for the betterment, move ahead smoothly

00:24:38.062 --> 00:24:40.295
You only are on the stage, not I

00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.729
You are on the stage. The world is watching you.

00:24:44.021 --> 00:24:46.880
Understand that the world is watching you, not to ME.

00:24:47.408 --> 00:24:51.012
They have taken that out, saying that this is Devi.

00:24:51.037 --> 00:24:53.400
I cannot be Devi.

00:24:53.425 --> 00:24:56.162
The point is that they have made a Devi

00:24:56.187 --> 00:24:58.475
Rest you handle.

00:25:03.586 --> 00:25:07.272
Delhiites are otherwise also sitting on the stage on their own.

00:25:07.281 --> 00:25:09.445
on the throne

00:25:09.470 --> 00:25:12.343
Bakasurs are sitting on the stage.

00:25:12.442 --> 00:25:13.790
They are sitting in the gallery.

00:25:13.815 --> 00:25:17.811
You are sitting on the threshold of God

00:25:17.836 --> 00:25:20.396
You sit there. People will watch you only.

00:25:20.421 --> 00:25:24.932
People sitting on the threshold

00:25:24.957 --> 00:25:28.047
will watch what are people living in Delhi doing?.

00:25:28.072 --> 00:25:33.057
It is a great responsibility.

00:25:33.082 --> 00:25:35.380
There is a great responsibility on people living in Delhi.

00:25:35.405 --> 00:25:37.709
What do you have to say?

00:25:37.968 --> 00:25:43.747
Lekhak ji (writer) Yes, say!

00:25:43.772 --> 00:25:47.853
Yes, write down

00:25:47.878 --> 00:25:49.473
(UNCLEAR)

00:25:49.519 --> 00:25:52.229
It is the best

00:25:52.301 --> 00:25:55.146
Deepa didn't come today?

00:25:55.171 --> 00:25:56.841
She is in Dharmshala

00:25:56.929 --> 00:25:58.509
Shri Mataji: She is in Dharamshala.

00:25:58.534 --> 00:26:01.192
S.Y: She is much better.

00:26:08.365 --> 00:26:09.365
Yes, you come!

00:26:12.181 --> 00:26:13.181
Open it.

00:26:19.697 --> 00:26:23.154
Fix it at bottom.

00:26:23.225 --> 00:26:37.901
music

00:26:37.926 --> 00:26:39.471
Shri Mataji to the singer: Your face has changed.

00:26:39.496 --> 00:26:44.221
Singer: Everything has wholly changed.

00:26:44.364 --> 00:26:49.361
Shri Mataji to a Sahajyogi: Just see! his face, saintly!

00:26:49.386 --> 00:26:55.504
Musician: Yesterday there was a great miracle.

00:26:55.529 --> 00:26:59.045
People have defamed me. Tomorrow i will tell on the stage.

00:26:59.070 --> 00:27:13.347
Rashtrapati has given me in written, result and certificate (UNCLEAR)

00:27:13.372 --> 00:27:17.649
I got President's award, people talked all nonsense.

00:27:17.674 --> 00:27:25.650
They are talking like that. They cannot defame MOTHER'S son.

00:31:22.618 --> 00:31:26.343
Shri Mataji: Beautiful! You people have started singing in Sanskrit

00:31:26.368 --> 00:31:27.609
It is great!

00:31:27.937 --> 00:31:41.021
Don't become Pandits now. It is really great!

00:31:41.101 --> 00:31:47.192
Actually, voice is vibrating.

00:31:47.495 --> 00:31:54.077
Because of the vibrations, it is cooling.

00:31:54.601 --> 00:31:58.561
When you sing you feel vibrates, your voice reverberates.

00:31:58.586 --> 00:32:00.296
The same is the case with him too.

00:32:00.321 --> 00:32:02.452
When he had sung earlier it was not so

00:32:02.477 --> 00:32:10.341
but since he is in (Sahaj) his voice vibrates.

00:32:10.714 --> 00:32:13.466
It is like a echo

00:32:14.514 --> 00:32:20.620
It is called PRATISATH in Sanskrit.

00:32:20.645 --> 00:32:26.251
Beautiful! He is doing so great!

00:32:26.276 --> 00:32:31.705
Such pronunciation of Sanskrit

00:32:31.776 --> 00:32:33.864
I have not heard such pure pronunciation among Punjabis.

00:32:33.889 --> 00:32:37.999
I am telling you the truth.

00:32:38.024 --> 00:32:40.704
I too have studied in Punjab.

00:32:40.911 --> 00:32:43.875
The language of that place is such

00:32:44.494 --> 00:32:47.776
And even Hindi speaking people pronounce SPASHT as ASPASHAT

00:32:48.110 --> 00:32:52.272
But I have never heard such pure pronunciation in Sanskrit language.

00:32:52.297 --> 00:32:54.194
I am telling you the truth. It is great!

00:32:54.218 --> 00:32:57.640
It is great! It should be so.

00:33:03.751 --> 00:33:10.021
S.Y: Basically, Mother it is the effort of Rajesh.

00:33:10.148 --> 00:33:13.988
He has started after coming here only.

00:33:14.013 --> 00:33:16.334
(UNCLEAR)

00:33:16.731 --> 00:33:19.893
Shri Mataji: Look at Rajesh as well!

00:33:19.918 --> 00:33:23.164
Now a days he is studying Gyaneshwari.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:28.597
S.Y: He is the one who started (UNCLEAR) Last time when he came,

00:33:28.653 --> 00:33:31.863
Rustam and he came that was the day this whole started.

00:33:31.895 --> 00:33:32.518
Shri Mataji: Oh! Really!

00:33:32.543 --> 00:33:33.380
S.Y: About a week ago.

00:33:33.405 --> 00:33:38.631
Then started Sanskrit. Rustam didn't know DEVNAGRI LIPI(script)

00:33:38.671 --> 00:33:39.540
Can you imagine?

00:33:39.565 --> 00:33:42.078
He didn't know Devnagri.

00:33:42.103 --> 00:33:45.194
He never studied Devnagri. He studied in English school

00:33:45.258 --> 00:33:46.303
then stayed in England.

00:33:46.328 --> 00:33:47.869
He didn't know Devnagri.

00:33:47.894 --> 00:33:48.779
He studied Sanskrit

00:33:48.804 --> 00:33:51.068
and is writing MY names in Sanskrit.

00:33:51.094 --> 00:33:53.535
He has already written one thousand names.

00:33:54.386 --> 00:33:55.961
S.Y: Has Rustam written?

00:33:55.986 --> 00:34:00.371
Shri Mataji: Yes, He has written one thousand names.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:01.767
S.Y: He is a Sanskrit scholar.

00:34:01.792 --> 00:34:03.089
Shri Mataji: He has become a Sanskrit scholar

00:34:03.137 --> 00:34:04.137
S.Y: And very inspired.

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:06.613
Shri Mataji: Yes, even Gregoire!

00:34:06.878 --> 00:34:11.051
Gregoire has become a Sanskrit scholar.

00:34:11.815 --> 00:34:13.672
Absolutely Sanskrit scholar.

00:34:16.612 --> 00:34:22.624
How does the result of Sahajyoga come out?

00:34:22.776 --> 00:34:24.312
Because one who doesn't know even Devnagri

00:34:24.344 --> 00:34:26.479
Gregoire never not even Hindi words

00:34:26.526 --> 00:34:28.899
It is worth noticing, how beautifully he writes!

00:34:30.778 --> 00:34:33.523
One who didn't know even A,AA,I,EE (Devnagri Script)

00:34:34.438 --> 00:34:35.438
How did it happen?

00:34:35.477 --> 00:34:38.496
Our Babba doesn't know Urdu at all.

00:34:38.521 --> 00:34:39.474
I still know a little bit of it.

00:34:39.499 --> 00:34:40.725
not even a little bit of Urdu.

00:34:40.750 --> 00:34:44.357
But the poetry he has done in Urdu

00:34:44.388 --> 00:34:44.964
You listen to him.

00:34:44.989 --> 00:34:47.727
MY brother, he is a Chartered accountant.

00:34:47.783 --> 00:34:50.295
He didn't know even the name of poetry, what is poetry

00:34:50.485 --> 00:34:53.754
He was just like a stone hearted in this field.

00:34:53.779 --> 00:34:56.643
He writes (Poetry) so beautifully, so marvelous.

00:34:57.902 --> 00:34:59.695
(UNCLEAR)

00:34:59.963 --> 00:35:01.407
He has started writing very deep (poetry)

00:35:01.828 --> 00:35:04.167
He has named himself 'Dilosh'

00:35:04.192 --> 00:35:05.945
means NIRMAL

00:35:08.926 --> 00:35:11.099
named himself, very good (poetry) he writes.

00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:15.090
MY brother himself wonders, where do YOU get these words from?

00:35:15.188 --> 00:35:15.956
says: i don't know.

00:35:15.981 --> 00:35:16.643
says I give him.

00:35:16.668 --> 00:35:18.567
I said some words I too don't know.

00:35:18.592 --> 00:35:24.675
How does one know? It is so great!

00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:26.520
He has started writing very nicely.

00:35:26.545 --> 00:35:28.659
It is so surprising how. How does one bloom?

00:35:28.770 --> 00:35:31.638
(UNCLEAR) poetry I never expected from him.

00:35:31.663 --> 00:35:35.479
He is a Chartered accountant.

00:35:35.556 --> 00:35:39.665
Except Math and counting he has heard no other sound.

00:35:39.690 --> 00:35:41.483
I don't know from where he got this thing.

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.726
And says, i go on writing.

00:35:43.751 --> 00:35:45.556
Now he is writing in Marathi.

00:35:45.581 --> 00:35:49.336
His Marathi language was so weak, that I used to write his essays.

00:35:49.387 --> 00:35:52.552
He is writing in Marathi.

00:35:52.577 --> 00:35:55.719
He is writing in Hindi, but out of all, the best he writes in Urdu.

00:35:56.847 --> 00:35:58.479
[ SHERO SHAYIRI ] poet's expression in poetic manner

00:35:58.504 --> 00:36:00.696
and there are no rhyming words at all.

00:36:03.022 --> 00:36:05.780
It should be said that there is actual poetry in him.

00:36:05.805 --> 00:36:07.318
Actual poetry!

00:36:07.517 --> 00:36:09.841
There is nothing useless

00:36:09.866 --> 00:36:10.946
Nothing useless!

00:36:10.971 --> 00:36:13.542
Do you see this MILAN KI SHAYIRI (poetry of union) we have got?

00:36:13.567 --> 00:36:16.499
The earlier poetry was all about gloominess

00:36:16.524 --> 00:36:17.925
VIRAH KI SHAYIRI [poetry of separation]

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:19.349
Now it is poetry of union.

00:36:19.878 --> 00:36:22.615
You set it in his song

00:36:23.424 --> 00:36:26.011
There are so many

00:36:26.442 --> 00:36:29.956
but they were not so popular.

00:36:35.172 --> 00:36:37.606
S.Y: It is coming right from the heart.

00:36:37.631 --> 00:36:39.108
He is writing right from the heart.

00:36:40.003 --> 00:36:40.500
Shri Mataji saying about HER brother:

00:36:40.627 --> 00:36:43.498
It is remarkable for him to write poetry.

00:36:43.523 --> 00:36:46.640
I know he is conditioning poetry very well.

00:36:46.663 --> 00:36:49.961
Because of Marathi he had little difficulty

00:36:49.986 --> 00:36:52.218
I used to sit with him to teach him poetry.

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:55.819
I would tell him that by telling you, I will lose my poetry.

00:36:55.844 --> 00:36:57.562
It doesn't enter even your head.

00:36:57.618 --> 00:37:00.476
He would ask: Why do they write?

00:37:00.501 --> 00:37:02.251
Why don't they write in a straight forward manner?

00:37:02.276 --> 00:37:05.279
writing about moon and this and that in a twisted manner

00:37:05.305 --> 00:37:06.316
it is better to say

00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.648
it seems (UNCLEAR)

00:37:09.673 --> 00:37:10.851
When he was young

00:37:10.876 --> 00:37:12.400
when he was in Matric

00:37:12.479 --> 00:37:14.919
(UNCLEAR)

00:37:14.944 --> 00:37:17.195
Would say why did they need to write all this?

00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.824
It has caused my headache.

00:37:18.849 --> 00:37:21.210
If one has to learn this Marathi language

00:37:21.235 --> 00:37:21.959
it is a great headache.

00:37:21.984 --> 00:37:22.803
I would tell him don't learn Marathi

00:37:22.828 --> 00:37:24.371
He would say it is compulsory, what to do?

00:37:24.396 --> 00:37:27.088
Such was his condition.

00:37:27.502 --> 00:37:30.461
In Marathi he would just pass or fail.

00:37:31.371 --> 00:37:32.850
He is good at Mathematics.

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:34.764
But I could not understand

00:37:34.789 --> 00:37:37.232
from where this new flower has bloomed.

00:37:37.286 --> 00:37:41.408
It happened like this that somewhere

00:37:41.433 --> 00:37:46.024
you can say for example that a lotus has bloomed out of a rose

00:37:46.049 --> 00:37:51.442
(UNCLEAR)

00:37:51.467 --> 00:37:56.908
It is like that, can't understand anything

00:37:56.933 --> 00:38:00.065
But it means, what an unusual, strange and

00:38:00.090 --> 00:38:02.244
an unprecedented event is going on.

00:38:02.268 --> 00:38:04.605
but like this something must come out of everybody.

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:07.166
some miracles should take place, then it will be recognized.

00:38:07.912 --> 00:38:10.284
He (singer) is also saying that he will tell some miracle

00:38:10.309 --> 00:38:11.945
A great miracle he has come across.

00:38:11.970 --> 00:38:14.412
S.Y: Yes, really!

00:38:14.437 --> 00:38:16.048
Shri Mataji: What you are saying

00:38:16.073 --> 00:38:18.644
the reason for that is only that you are NISHKALANK (pure)

00:38:18.824 --> 00:38:20.841
Nobody can disgrace you!

00:38:20.866 --> 00:38:24.396
If somebody tries, he cannot disgrace you.

00:38:24.476 --> 00:38:29.586
Nobody can disgrace you, even a little bit

00:38:29.611 --> 00:38:32.420
Even if you think that this person is disgracing you

00:38:32.445 --> 00:38:35.723
You will see that this disgrace will be on his face.

00:38:38.553 --> 00:38:41.851
In Illustrated Weekly Rajneesh sent a woman

00:38:41.876 --> 00:38:44.181
bribed her, to interview ME.

00:38:44.205 --> 00:38:46.765
and made a third Muslim lady to write

00:38:46.790 --> 00:38:48.712
and in that some wrong statements were

00:38:48.737 --> 00:38:51.327
that SHE is such

00:38:51.352 --> 00:38:55.667
HER ways are such that SHE mesmerizes. All nonsense.

00:38:55.691 --> 00:38:57.249
My husband got very angry.

00:38:57.274 --> 00:38:59.590
Especially, my brother took a dagger.

00:38:59.616 --> 00:39:02.234
Both of them said, "Now we have to drag them to the court."

00:39:02.259 --> 00:39:04.073
I told them, I am not going to the court.

00:39:04.098 --> 00:39:06.109
If you want to put up a case, you go, I am not going to the court.

00:39:06.181 --> 00:39:07.185
(UNCLEAR)

00:39:07.210 --> 00:39:08.623
I asked them what will you do?

00:39:08.649 --> 00:39:10.929
There in London people told them

00:39:10.954 --> 00:39:13.354
that they should put up a case for ten lakhs.

00:39:13.629 --> 00:39:14.863
I said, " I won't go to the court."

00:39:14.895 --> 00:39:16.641
You do whatever you want to do.

00:39:16.666 --> 00:39:17.895
It is not going to pay you any dividend.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.038
I made them to understand a lot.

00:39:19.063 --> 00:39:21.760
I told Rajesh to talk to them.

00:39:21.785 --> 00:39:23.803
Tell them to ask for forgiveness

00:39:23.828 --> 00:39:25.502
so that this matter will be over.

00:39:25.527 --> 00:39:27.654
I don't like this court business.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:30.086
When nobody came to any agreement

00:39:30.111 --> 00:39:33.202
The Illustrated Weekly came to closure for six months.

00:39:33.266 --> 00:39:35.520
And they had a loss in terms of Crores.

00:39:40.734 --> 00:39:45.494
Then their employees went on a strike.

00:39:46.186 --> 00:39:49.345
Then they sent a message.

00:39:49.370 --> 00:39:52.500
They are saying why you had written against our Mataji

00:39:52.525 --> 00:39:53.769
we will go on strike.

00:39:53.794 --> 00:39:55.516
I said that they have written long back.

00:39:55.541 --> 00:39:57.459
Why are you going on a strike now?

00:39:57.568 --> 00:40:00.028
Already they have been punished

00:40:00.053 --> 00:40:02.561
But they won't change.

00:40:03.183 --> 00:40:06.339
You have to set right first of all, newspaper agencies.

00:40:06.694 --> 00:40:09.384
Now you tell ME what is the need to write what Rajneesh is saying?

00:40:09.805 --> 00:40:14.058
Now a days it is Ravan UVACHA (what did Ravana say?)

00:40:14.083 --> 00:40:17.326
S.Y: That is a fact.

00:40:17.351 --> 00:40:20.199
Shri Mataji: This is the Geeta of modern times.

00:40:20.569 --> 00:40:22.347
What useless he is talking?

00:40:22.372 --> 00:40:23.871
They get a lot of pleasure by publishing it.

00:40:23.896 --> 00:40:25.164
Don't know why?

00:40:25.599 --> 00:40:27.444
And now a days he is in Goa.

00:40:27.469 --> 00:40:29.429
Now a days we can see some more people.

00:40:29.454 --> 00:40:31.020
As bed bugs multiply

00:40:31.045 --> 00:40:34.697
so can be seen two to four such people in Poona.

00:40:34.906 --> 00:40:36.170
They will all be taken into account.

00:40:36.195 --> 00:40:39.051
They will surely reach Poona.

00:40:39.076 --> 00:40:41.389
Poona!

00:40:41.414 --> 00:40:44.675
They are coming out at wrong place.

00:40:46.302 --> 00:40:47.240
All this

00:40:47.265 --> 00:40:48.772
Their techniques are like

00:40:48.797 --> 00:40:51.480
it appears to be like a group

00:40:51.949 --> 00:40:53.596
They help each other.

00:40:53.621 --> 00:40:55.544
We too should have our strong group.

00:40:55.569 --> 00:40:57.645
Question doesn't arise that anybody can touch you!

00:40:57.670 --> 00:40:58.972
We should live like this.

00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:00.571
We are all one.

00:41:00.596 --> 00:41:01.563
We should have one aim.

00:41:01.588 --> 00:41:03.347
We should know this aim.

00:41:03.372 --> 00:41:06.823
Then you will enjoy your dividends yourself.

00:41:07.584 --> 00:41:11.437
But when we don't know that aim, we face problems.

00:41:14.158 --> 00:41:15.249
We have come to Delhi.

00:41:15.274 --> 00:41:17.046
We have to do something or the other here.

00:41:17.071 --> 00:41:18.461
It is New Year!

00:41:18.486 --> 00:41:21.115
You do whatever you desire.

00:41:21.141 --> 00:41:22.941
In the evening we have pujan

00:41:22.966 --> 00:41:24.957
We will see then.

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:29.158
But all these desires should be for the betterment of everyone.

00:41:30.185 --> 00:41:32.926
Not for yourself, I take care of you.

00:41:32.951 --> 00:41:35.788
There is no worry about you. It should for everyone.

00:41:35.916 --> 00:41:37.372
It should be for the group.

00:41:37.397 --> 00:41:38.762
It should be for others.

00:41:38.787 --> 00:41:39.898
Not for yourself.

00:41:39.923 --> 00:41:41.692
You for yourself have (surrendered to ME)

00:41:41.717 --> 00:41:44.808
You said that you have surrendered yourself to ME

00:41:44.872 --> 00:41:48.084
I am already managing you.

00:41:51.410 --> 00:41:53.720
You have to take care of the whole world.

00:41:53.745 --> 00:41:57.517
Specially, We have to take care of Delhi.

00:41:58.840 --> 00:42:01.279
Is it okay!
