[UNCLEAR]

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:10.168
Presenter: Okay, so as Niger said, I
will tell you about the Medical aspects of

00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:17.867
Sahaja yoga and as we heard Sahaja yoga is a
spiritual method but it has been associated

00:00:17.867 --> 00:00:23.374
with health benefits. So, I will tell you
of the effect of the working on the brain,

00:00:23.374 --> 00:00:28.110
on your health and on diseases - mental
and physical diseases.

00:00:30.376 --> 00:00:36.336
First of all, what is meditation? And Niger has
already explained, more or less, what
meditation is.

00:00:36.336 --> 00:00:41.793
I would just say a few more words. So, if
you read Oxford dictionary, it says that,

00:00:41.793 --> 00:00:48.278
meditation is thinking in silence. Now first
of all, you cannot think aloud and secondly,

00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:54.237
thinking is, of course, the exact opposite of what
meditation is, as originally conceived in the East.

00:00:54.608 --> 00:01:00.428
So meditation - Patanjali was one of the first
to talk about meditation and he said that,

00:01:00.428 --> 00:01:05.176
"Meditation is the cessation of thinking."
It's the stopping of your thoughts,

00:01:05.176 --> 00:01:10.613
it's the control of your thoughts, the
control of your attention. In the West, we

00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:16.530
we know there are three states of consciousness
- the sleeping, dreaming and thinking

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.977
but in the East - and we think that thinking
is the higher state of consciousness -

00:01:20.977 --> 00:01:25.663
but in the East, it's very common knowledge
that there's another state of consciousness.

00:01:25.663 --> 00:01:29.544
It's called the fourth state of consciousness
- Turiya awastha - and the fourth

00:01:29.544 --> 00:01:34.611
state of consciousness is the state of
thoughtless awareness - mental silence,

00:01:34.611 --> 00:01:41.425
where you learn to stop your thinking and
this process of stopping your thinking has

00:01:41.425 --> 00:01:47.786
amazing benefits, at the subjective level
but also objectively and you feel, when

00:01:47.786 --> 00:01:53.995
your thoughts are stopped, you feel a
happy, you feel joy and depending on the

00:01:53.995 --> 00:01:59.309
intensity, you can feel Absolute Bliss. So,
there's several subjective correlates what you

00:01:59.309 --> 00:02:05.680
feel when you meditate, which are listed here
and which, however, have health implications.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.129
And as I said before, in the West, we are
not really interested in spiritual things

00:02:10.129 --> 00:02:14.548
but we are very much interested in our health
and in fact, we're obsessed with our health.

00:02:14.548 --> 00:02:19.344
And it's the health benefits, which have actually
attracted all the interest in Western Science.

00:02:19.344 --> 00:02:23.763
So, over the last years, there has been a
lot of studies on meditation because people

00:02:23.763 --> 00:02:29.838
have realized meditation, actually, leads
to better health. And, so what you feel when

00:02:29.838 --> 00:02:35.547
you meditate, you feel an overwhelming
calmness and there is a calmness which

00:02:35.547 --> 00:02:41.751
goes much more beyond normal relaxation
because when we relax, you relax the body

00:02:41.751 --> 00:02:46.153
and if you lie in the sofa, you may be
relaxed but, if you worry about the future,

00:02:46.153 --> 00:02:51.455
you're not really relaxed. So, when you're
thoughtless, you don't just relax the body

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:56.550
you also relax the mind and your brain and
you cannot do it with any other way, you

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.432
can only do it by stopping to think,
stopping to worry about the future,

00:03:00.432 --> 00:03:06.457
stopping to ruminate about the past and
be in the present. So, this overwhelming

00:03:06.457 --> 00:03:13.277
feeling of peace within, calmness, is associated
with stress relief and I'll show you later, how.

00:03:14.127 --> 00:03:19.817
When you're mentally silent, you have a
better mental balance and this is because,

00:03:19.817 --> 00:03:24.364
if you think about it, all mental disorders
are actually characterized by thought disorder,

00:03:24.364 --> 00:03:29.125
thought problems. If you have Schizophrenia,
you have paranoid thoughts. If you're, Obsessive

00:03:29.125 --> 00:03:33.533
Compulsive, you have obsessive thoughts.
If you're ADHD, you have racing thoughts

00:03:33.533 --> 00:03:38.589
and if you're depressed, you have negative
thoughts which ruminate, which you ruminate about.

00:03:38.801 --> 00:03:43.861
So, it has also been shown, that all
disorders, all mental disorders, they have

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:48.910
more mental clutter. This has been shown
over recent years and meditation, of course,

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.450
is a reduction of their mental clutter because,
that's what it is, you stop your thinking, so

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.160
you have no mental clutter or you have less
mental clutter. So therefore, mental silence

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.417
is a state of super mental balance more
than normal people have, so because if you

00:04:03.417 --> 00:04:07.960
meditate and you have less mental clutter
than a normal person, you're super healthy

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.955
and super balanced mentally. When you don't
have any thoughts, you're much more
concentrated

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:18.725
and and you're much more alert because
you're pure consciousness without the content,

00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:23.210
[UNCLEAR] the thought and emotions and if you
go through life, the whole day you throw out

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.242
your thoughts and your emotions into the
world and you don't really see reality as

00:04:27.242 --> 00:04:31.924
it really is because you constantly, you 
have the intermediation of your thoughts

00:04:31.924 --> 00:04:37.881
and your emotions. So, when you have no
thoughts, you much more, you absorb reality

00:04:37.881 --> 00:04:42.066
as it really is. So for example, if you're
now listening to me, you may be thinking

00:04:42.066 --> 00:04:46.191
of the dinner later and you may have to
inhibit your thoughts in order to actually

00:04:46.191 --> 00:04:51.254
listen or attend. If you have no thoughts,
you absorb information much quicker.

00:04:51.261 --> 00:04:55.641
And it has been shown, that children who
meditate, have better attention at school

00:04:55.641 --> 00:05:00.460
same with this, who meditate for long time,
have better attention and it has been

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.278
associated with better productivity at 
work because of your more concentrate and

00:05:04.278 --> 00:05:10.636
have no mental clutter, you're actually more
focused. Another very interesting feature,

00:05:10.636 --> 00:05:14.830
which I've said before, when you have no
thoughts, you feel happy, you feel bliss,

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.535
you feel joy and this of course, if you 
have these positive emotions through your

00:05:22.535 --> 00:05:27.110
meditation because it's so peaceful and
so pleasant a state of mental silence,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.977
then you carry this over into daily life
and this leads to more positive emotions

00:05:32.977 --> 00:05:38.540
and positive emotions, of course, protect you
against depression, anxiety, effective disorders

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:42.393
and is, of course, very good for you
and you have less negative thinking.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:48.612
Last but absolutely not least - to me this
is the most important aspect of meditation

00:05:48.612 --> 00:05:55.676
- you achieve a state of emotional detachment,
you enter witness state, where actually go

00:05:55.676 --> 00:05:59.909
beyond your thoughts because you're no
longer thinking and you no longer having

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.843
your emotions but you see them from a
stepping back witness state but we call it

00:06:04.843 --> 00:06:09.573
in Psychology a Meta cognitive awareness,
where you're beyond your thoughts and you

00:06:09.573 --> 00:06:14.651
can observe them and that's, I think, the
most important thing of meditation,

00:06:14.651 --> 00:06:19.530
most important aspect and if you remember,
Buddha went out to find meditation because

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:24.320
He realized that a lot of suffering in the
world and how do you deal with the suffering?

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:27.860
You cannot control the life events; We
all have negative life events. You know,

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.873
your parents will die eventually, people
you love may die, you may have a divorce

00:06:31.873 --> 00:06:37.591
Whatever happens to you, you cannot really
control those life events but what you can

00:06:37.591 --> 00:06:42.350
control is, how you actually deal with those
life events and how you perceive them.

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.478
You can control your state of mind and
your thoughts and your emotions and that

00:06:46.478 --> 00:06:50.764
we do via meditation and that's the only
way. Only through meditation you can

00:06:50.764 --> 00:06:57.663
actually enter a witness state which makes
you emotionally more resilient and I think

00:06:57.663 --> 00:07:02.116
this is the most important aspect of
meditation because who wouldn't want to be

00:07:02.116 --> 00:07:07.180
happy and stay through life in a, sort of,
serene, happy, joyful way without being

00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.751
carried away on a roller coaster of emotions
constantly depending on what happens to you.

00:07:11.781 --> 00:07:19.872
So, I think, this is crucial and of course, the
state of meditation, of thoughtless awareness,

00:07:19.872 --> 00:07:25.966
you may have seen and it has been described
in all mystical traditions of all cultures.

00:07:25.966 --> 00:07:32.233
Here just a few names - Nirvana, Sahaj
Samadhi, Satori, Yoga - which means union,

00:07:32.233 --> 00:07:39.830
Zen, Tao and in the West we had our own
meditation, our own tradition of mental silence,

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:43.893
which were the Christian Gnostics and
'gno' which means, of course, knowledge -

00:07:43.893 --> 00:07:48.388
which means the knowledge of your Self and
your Self - you're not just this thoughts

00:07:48.388 --> 00:07:52.921
and these emotions but you're different
thing, you're actually a spiritual person,

00:07:52.921 --> 00:07:59.508
which can go beyond the thoughts and
emotions. So, the claims I would try to

00:07:59.508 --> 00:08:05.352
prove to you today and show you medical
evidence, is that meditation, in fact, has
an effect on

00:08:05.352 --> 00:08:10.724
the body because mental silence reduces
stress and it activates the Para Sympathetic

00:08:10.724 --> 00:08:16.306
Nervous System, which restores bodily
functions. I will show you that meditation

00:08:16.306 --> 00:08:21.996
has an effect on the brain and mental
silence is a different state of consciousness,

00:08:21.996 --> 00:08:27.716
you activate different areas of the brain
of deep attention, of positive emotions

00:08:27.716 --> 00:08:34.848
and thus you release happy chemicals which
make you joyful. Now, meditation is a

00:08:34.848 --> 00:08:39.628
good way to prevent illness because mental
silence leads to better physical and

00:08:39.628 --> 00:08:44.752
mental health and lastly, I will show you
that you can use it as a therapy. So, if

00:08:44.752 --> 00:08:49.827
you have any mental or physical problems,
you can actually solve them with meditation.

00:08:52.224 --> 00:08:58.754
So, what happens in the body? And first
of all, we have already seen a bit of a

00:08:58.754 --> 00:09:04.472
explanation of the chakra chart over here
and what you will see here - we'll just stop

00:09:04.472 --> 00:09:10.190
this for a moment - this is the Central
Nervous System here. The Central Nervous System,

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:14.305
this is the spinal cord, this is the brain
and the limbic area of the brain is quite

00:09:14.305 --> 00:09:18.532
important because I will talk about it later,
lies within the brain in the middle and

00:09:18.532 --> 00:09:24.135
this is the center of emotion and motivation.
So this is the Central Nervous System.

00:09:24.135 --> 00:09:29.736
What you will see next, is actually the Autonomic
Nervous System, which is also depicted here.

00:09:29.736 --> 00:09:37.327
This is the Central channel, this is the Left
and the Right Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:09:37.327 --> 00:09:44.291
So these aren't just some sort of fancy lines
but these are actually, they correspond to

00:09:44.291 --> 00:09:49.325
Medical System and in any Medicine book
you can read after Autonomic Nervous System

00:09:49.325 --> 00:09:54.520
consists of the Left and Right Sympathetic
Nervous System and the Para Sympathetic

00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.379
Nervous System and I will explain later a bit
more what it is. Sorry, let's watch the movie.

00:10:04.859 --> 00:10:10.429
So, this is the Left and Right Sympathetic
Nervous System and the middle channel is,

00:10:10.429 --> 00:10:15.180
corresponds to the Para Sympathetic
Nervous System and the Spiritual Energy

00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.610
we have inside, when we meditate, actually
passes through all these nerve plexuses,

00:10:20.825 --> 00:10:26.445
so this is the Solar Plexus, this is the
Cervical Plexus and it enters the Limbic

00:10:26.445 --> 00:10:31.662
area of the brain and when it enters the limbic
area of the brain, we become thoughtless.

00:10:35.372 --> 00:10:42.362
All these different chakras, they
correspond to the nerve plexusus
and to the endocrine system.

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:51.360
So, the Sympathetic Nervous System and the
Para Sympathetic Nervous System are very

00:10:51.360 --> 00:10:56.385
important and they need to be in balance.
So in daily life, you are either in this,

00:10:56.385 --> 00:11:00.442
what is called a, fight or flight mode,
you activate the Right or Left Sympathetic

00:11:00.442 --> 00:11:04.178
Nervous System - one is important for
action, one is important for inhibition -

00:11:04.916 --> 00:11:10.176
and in the night when you sleep, you activate
the Para Sympathetic Nervous System.

00:11:10.176 --> 00:11:14.918
So, this system relaxes and restores all
the bodily functions, while the other one

00:11:14.918 --> 00:11:19.588
is important for daily activities. Now,
they have to be in balance. So if you think,

00:11:19.588 --> 00:11:23.710
you can survive with 4 hours of sleep
a day, then you're sadly mistaken,

00:11:23.710 --> 00:11:29.113
you pay it later with your health for this
habit because it is important that your

00:11:29.113 --> 00:11:35.410
body gets restored. So, the Sympathetic 
Nervous System is activated in daily activities

00:11:35.410 --> 00:11:40.660
and the more stressed you are, the more it
is activated. So what it does, it supplies

00:11:40.221 --> 00:11:46.261
a maximum blood to all the muscles for
the daily activities, the stress hormones

00:11:46.261 --> 00:11:53.210
are increased, there is more, the lungs the
passages are dilated, you have increased

00:11:53.210 --> 00:11:57.550
heart rate and, if you're constantly
stressed, it may actually affect your heart

00:11:57.550 --> 00:12:04.501
and during the rest, when you activate the
Para Sympathetic Nervous System, then the

00:12:04.501 --> 00:12:10.195
opposite happens and you have a decreased
heart rate, more blood is given to all the

00:12:10.195 --> 00:12:14.940
organs, which restores all the bodily
functions which you have wasted in the day

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:21.845
and there is decreased activity of stress
hormones and the digestion is stimulated.

00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:27.890
So, what research has shown, that meditation
activates the Para Sympathetic Nervous System

00:12:27.890 --> 00:12:32.484
more than rest. So that means, you enter
a state of hyper-rest, which is better than sleep

00:12:32.858 --> 00:12:40.638
and this has been shown in many, by many
studies conducted in India and in Australia.

00:12:40.878 --> 00:12:46.218
So what happens is, there is a decrease
in heart rate, there is a decrease in the

00:12:46.218 --> 00:12:51.478
breathing rate, there is a decrease
in pulse rate, in blood pressure,

00:12:51.478 --> 00:12:56.699
in Oxygen metabolism - and this is anti-
ageing - and there's a decrease in other

00:12:56.699 --> 00:13:01.997
Physiological parameters of stress. And I'll
show you a few examples. So, this is the

00:13:01.997 --> 00:13:08.898
Blood Pressure in people who have - the
control is the red line - so, these people

00:13:08.898 --> 00:13:14.050
doing 20 minutes rest, nothing really
happens. These are people, who have

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:19.987
meditated for four weeks, so after 20 minutes
of meditation only, the blood pressure goes down

00:13:19.987 --> 00:13:25.276
and those who meditated for 8 weeks, have
a stronger effect and those who meditated

00:13:25.276 --> 00:13:30.169
for 12 weeks, have a really strong health. So in
other words, if you have High Blood Pressure,

00:13:30.169 --> 00:13:37.810
you can reduce it by meditation. This is
the heart rate. Again, the controls and again,

00:13:37.810 --> 00:13:42.847
the more practiced the people are in
meditation, the more the heart rate goes down.

00:13:42.847 --> 00:13:46.134
This is, of course, very good, it protects
your heart, if you constantly have a

00:13:46.134 --> 00:13:51.155
reduction in heart rate on a daily basis.
That's very good for you and, of course,

00:13:51.155 --> 00:13:58.189
all the other measures as well. This is a study
by Dr. Chung from Philadelphia University and she

00:13:58.189 --> 00:14:03.879
took people who had Hypertension and she
gave them one week of intensive meditation.

00:14:03.879 --> 00:14:09.968
They had to meditate in a Meditation hospital
everyday for, I don't know, 8 hours or so

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:17.154
and the blood pressure, the High Blood Pressure
went down significantly in the meditators

00:14:17.154 --> 00:14:21.970
but not in the controls, who were getting
normal treatment in a normal hospital.

00:14:22.195 --> 00:14:27.525
So meditation is far better and only after
one week you can reduce your Hypertension,

00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:35.377
which is quite impressive. So in conclusion,
the state of mental silence reduces Sympathetic

00:14:35.377 --> 00:14:40.803
activity and what that means, it enhances
Para Sympathetic activity, which restores

00:14:40.803 --> 00:14:45.501
and restores all your bodily functions
and de-stresses the body.

00:14:46.743 --> 00:14:50.873
Now another very curious phenomena,
which if you may have noticed,

00:14:50.873 --> 00:14:54.242
if you meditated with us for a while,
and if you knew, you

00:14:54.242 --> 00:14:58.441
will feel it at the end when we have the
meditation. When you achieve the state of

00:14:58.441 --> 00:15:04.293
mental silence, you feel a cool breeze on
the hands and on top of the fontanel area

00:15:04.293 --> 00:15:10.194
and the fontanel is called fontanel because
it comes out like a fountain. So, this cool breeze

00:15:10.194 --> 00:15:14.340
is described in the Bible, for example, it's
called a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost and

00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:19.356
Holy Ghost of course, means your own Spiritual
energy and studies have actually shown that

00:15:19.356 --> 00:15:23.673
this isn't just something you imagine
because sometimes people say, when we ask

00:15:23.673 --> 00:15:27.127
you, "Do you feel cool breeze?" you know
they think that they have to say, yes to

00:15:27.127 --> 00:15:31.233
please you. They think, you sort of,
suggesting it and that's why they feel it.

00:15:31.233 --> 00:15:36.110
This is not true. Studies have shown this
is people during the rest period and in

00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:40.753
the rest period the temperature of the hand
actually goes up a little bit, that's normal

00:15:40.753 --> 00:15:46.087
but in meditation the temperature goes
down significantly and this has been shown

00:15:46.087 --> 00:15:52.089
on the hands and on the top of the heads and
some people I feel it on the feet for example also.

00:15:52.091 --> 00:15:59.321
I think, it can also be on the feet. So in
conclusion, Sahaja yoga meditation activates

00:15:59.321 --> 00:16:03.786
the Para Sympathetic Nervous System
and this restores your bodily functions.

00:16:05.232 --> 00:16:11.132
Now, what about the brain? And, of course,
the brain is important because if you can show

00:16:11.132 --> 00:16:16.032
that meditation leads to different activation
of the brain, then you have proof that it's

00:16:16.032 --> 00:16:20.483
not just thinking but it's something else.
Then you prove you're actually, in fact,

00:16:20.483 --> 00:16:25.715
entering an altered state of consciousness
and that's crucially important. So, there

00:16:25.715 --> 00:16:32.778
have been several brain imaging studies.
This is a study done by Simon Guluchekin

00:16:32.778 --> 00:16:38.888
from Washington University and what he
showed is that, when people meditate, there is

00:16:38.888 --> 00:16:45.463
an activity, a very slow wave of activity coming
from the limbic system called Theta activity.

00:16:46.717 --> 00:16:54.027
This activity is there when you are in deep
focused attention and has been associated

00:16:54.027 --> 00:16:59.645
with creativity and this activity was sort
of focused on the Frontal and Parietal areas,

00:16:59.645 --> 00:17:04.669
which are areas of deep attention. The
next study was a study using MI, which is

00:17:04.669 --> 00:17:11.282
a better result study and which I was in Boston
and this was done by Dr. Sakeo Eknumbis,

00:17:11.282 --> 00:17:18.910
so he used this MI scanner. To input people
in this scanner, they had to meditate for,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:25.970
I think, about 20 minutes and in the initial stages
of meditation, the meditators activated the

00:17:25.970 --> 00:17:30.714
same regions you've seen before, so the
right Frontal lobe and the temporal lobe.

00:17:30.714 --> 00:17:36.428
So this is a special, is a key area for deep
attention and also for inhibition because

00:17:36.428 --> 00:17:40.559
when you start to meditate, you inhibit
your thoughts, so you activate this area

00:17:40.559 --> 00:17:46.041
for inhibition but what is interesting is, it
was in both sides of the hemispheres but

00:17:46.041 --> 00:17:51.828
as they went deeper into meditation, the
activation became progressively more reduced

00:17:51.828 --> 00:17:56.366
and then, as they go into a deep state of
meditation, there's hardly any activity left

00:17:56.366 --> 00:18:00.861
in the brain - they have just have a little bit
activity here on the right of the Frontal lobe,

00:18:00.861 --> 00:18:06.477
which is this area of deep attention. So,
in other words, in meditation, you achieve

00:18:06.477 --> 00:18:16.339
a state of deep attention, of concentrated relaxed
activity, which is mediating deep concentration.

00:18:17.133 --> 00:18:24.863
What they also measured then, the effect of SP
pulse, stop having thoughts they feel joy,

00:18:24.863 --> 00:18:30.174
they feel bliss and as they feel more and
more bliss, again they get this Theta activity

00:18:30.174 --> 00:18:34.405
which comes from the limbic system and it
focused over the Left Frontal lobe, which

00:18:34.405 --> 00:18:39.295
is the key area of positive emotions. So,
essentially what the studies are showing,

00:18:39.295 --> 00:18:44.824
that, in fact when you meditate, you activate
areas of attention and of positive emotions

00:18:45.087 --> 00:18:51.957
and this is of course, the objective correlate
of this Sanskrit denomination of meditation,

00:18:51.957 --> 00:18:57.099
which is Sat Chit Ananda, which means,
being pure attention and pure joy.

00:18:58.038 --> 00:19:03.508
And just to show you here the limbic system.
The limbic system consists of seven nuclei,

00:19:03.508 --> 00:19:08.159
which is also interesting because we have
seven chakras and this is the limbic system

00:19:08.159 --> 00:19:12.404
deep in the brain. So, this is what you
activate when you are in meditation and it

00:19:12.404 --> 00:19:22.313
gives you joy and happiness. Another very
important thing Dr. Simon Guluchegik found is

00:19:22.313 --> 00:19:27.833
that, when people meditate there is less
mental clutter and this slide which is there

00:19:27.833 --> 00:19:33.349
just so that but essentially this is showing
chaotic complexity - in the brain you have

00:19:33.349 --> 00:19:37.818
sort of, complex chaotic firing but, if 
you have less chaotic firing, it means you

00:19:37.818 --> 00:19:42.798
have less mental clutter and this chaotic
firing, as I said before, the mental clutter

00:19:42.798 --> 00:19:48.051
is increased in people with Schizophrenia,
depression, autism, ADHD. And these are

00:19:48.051 --> 00:19:52.250
normal people during rest and these are
meditators - so the meditators have

00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:56.864
significantly less mental clutter and that
is very important because it means, they

00:19:56.864 --> 00:19:59.341
have better mental balance.

00:20:02.302 --> 00:20:06.523
This is not, a Sahaja yoga meditation but
some people found that people who practice

00:20:06.523 --> 00:20:12.283
some Buddhism, have not just, what I showed
you before, was the activation of the brain

00:20:12.283 --> 00:20:16.505
this is the structure of the brain, so this
has a long time affect on the structure

00:20:16.505 --> 00:20:22.967
of the brain, so a long time Buddhist meditators
have Sacra Cortex, in the same region we've

00:20:22.967 --> 00:20:27.460
seen before, which are activated, which
are these attention areas, especially this

00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:33.652
here Right Frontal region and further more
but it's very important, they have normally,

00:20:33.652 --> 00:20:39.176
the thickness of this cortex reduces for
rest of your age. Now these are the normals

00:20:39.176 --> 00:20:44.163
but in the meditators this process is
delayed. So this suggests that, meditation

00:20:44.163 --> 00:20:50.087
is anti-ageing and actually, leads to a
delay of the normal ageing process of

00:20:50.087 --> 00:20:55.500
those attention regions. And of course, if you
think about it, meditation is attention training.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.468
If you sit for half an hour and you actually
concentrate and try to inhibit your thoughts.

00:21:03.284 --> 00:21:09.544
So, what happens at the chemical level
in the brain? And I think, this becomes

00:21:09.544 --> 00:21:14.890
very exciting. We have in the brain, so
called, opioid receptors and they're called

00:21:14.890 --> 00:21:22.247
opioid receptors because opium binds to them,
morphine binds to them and these opioids

00:21:22.247 --> 00:21:28.150
you can also release from within and a
better endorphins they're attached to these

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:32.275
opioid receptors and better endorphins are
released when you're in love or when you do

00:21:32.275 --> 00:21:37.974
sports but they're also released through
meditation. And this is very interesting

00:21:37.974 --> 00:21:45.775
because this could explain why actually
people, get, of course feel the joy and

00:21:45.775 --> 00:21:49.380
the happiness, apart from the activation
of the limbic system, which I've shown before

00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:55.199
but it also, you release happy chemicals
in the brain. What is interesting as well,

00:21:55.199 --> 00:22:01.506
is those opioids of course, those better
endorphins, they enhance the immune system

00:22:01.506 --> 00:22:06.728
and they have shown to slow down cancer
cells. So, this could explain, why some people

00:22:07.687 --> 00:22:12.287
can be cured with meditation from severe
diseases, like cancer because if you

00:22:12.287 --> 00:22:16.972
have a continuous release of better Endorphins,
which strengthen your immune system, slow down

00:22:16.972 --> 00:22:22.957
cancer cells, then this can easily explain
it and therefore this is not a miracle cure

00:22:22.957 --> 00:22:30.084
but is actually, can be explained. Other
studies have shown that meditation releases

00:22:30.084 --> 00:22:36.454
Dopamine. This is also released through
Cocaine or Amphetamines, so this is

00:22:36.454 --> 00:22:41.365
another drug, which is important, another
substance, which is important for feeling pleasure.

00:22:41.524 --> 00:22:47.064
So this explains, why people who meditate,
actually, get addicted to meditation because you

00:22:47.064 --> 00:22:54.401
get this constant high in your brain without paying
all the side effects of drugs, so you can actually

00:22:54.401 --> 00:23:02.275
achieve a state of pleasant, sort of, joy
continuously. And other meditations have

00:23:02.275 --> 00:23:06.754
shown that they increase in Serotonin;
This is a drug, which is typically allowed

00:23:06.754 --> 00:23:11.232
in depression, so this could explain why
meditators are less likely to be depressed.

00:23:11.675 --> 00:23:16.435
Melatonin, which is important for sleep
and also strengthens immune system,

00:23:16.435 --> 00:23:21.800
so again, this could again explain why people
when they meditate, they find you can sleep

00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:29.213
far easier and again it can enhance your
immune system. And GABA, which is important

00:23:29.213 --> 00:23:33.347
for cognitive functions like attention and
there is a decrease in stress hormones.

00:23:39.436 --> 00:23:45.976
So, the last study I want to tell you about
on the brain, is actually a study which

00:23:45.976 --> 00:23:51.624
was the very first to prove that meditators
are more detached. And I like to study a lot

00:23:51.624 --> 00:23:56.163
because this is the only one actually tried
to prove this point; And this was done again

00:23:56.163 --> 00:24:00.561
by Dr. Simon Guluchekin from Washington
University. What he did, he showed

00:24:00.561 --> 00:24:05.135
meditators and non-meditators a really
horrible movie, which is called Funny Games

00:24:05.135 --> 00:24:11.217
by Michael Hanake. If you've seen that movie,
it's, it's - I have not been able to watch it

00:24:11.217 --> 00:24:17.764
but it's actually a, it's supposed to show
cruel and to show the violence in our society.

00:24:17.764 --> 00:24:24.830
So it's a video of two, movie of two psychopathic
teenagers, which go into a house and
they kill everybody.

00:24:24.830 --> 00:24:30.340
They start by the dog, then the woman, then
the kids and then the father. So, this movie

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:36.990
is really quite terrible and they show this
movie to this poor people and as you can see,

00:24:36.990 --> 00:24:44.526
the blue are the controls, the red are the
meditators and at the subjective
psychological level,

00:24:44.526 --> 00:24:50.008
so this out the negative emotions, so the
controls have far more negative emotions,

00:24:50.008 --> 00:24:55.484
so they felt more disgust, more anxiety,
more sadness, more happiness after watching

00:24:55.484 --> 00:25:00.006
the movie and the red ones are the
meditators, so they had much less

00:25:00.006 --> 00:25:06.101
negative emotions than the non-meditators.
Then he measured on the skin. When you're

00:25:06.101 --> 00:25:10.952
stressed, you have more sweat on the skin, so
you can measure the level of stress level at the

00:25:10.952 --> 00:25:17.488
body and at the skin level, the meditators
had significantly less skin response than

00:25:17.488 --> 00:25:22.057
the controls, so at both the levels, the
meditators also were less affected by this

00:25:22.057 --> 00:25:27.920
negative movie. Lastly, he measured the
brain and this is the gamma activity.

00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:35.058
Gamma activity is released when you have
very intense emotions. So during the rest,

00:25:35.058 --> 00:25:39.368
the meditators and the controls didn't
differ but after the movie, the controls

00:25:39.368 --> 00:25:44.073
have this high gamma activity. There's
really high gamma activity, so they were

00:25:44.073 --> 00:25:48.743
really stressed out at the brain level by
the movie while the meditators kept their

00:25:48.743 --> 00:25:53.708
cool as well at the brain level. So in other
words, the meditators kept their cool

00:25:53.708 --> 00:25:58.301
at the psychological level, they were less
affected at the body level and less

00:25:58.301 --> 00:26:02.987
affected at the brain level. And this, I
think, is absolutely crucial because this

00:26:02.987 --> 00:26:09.405
is sort of proof that meditation makes me
more detached and more able to cope with

00:26:09.405 --> 00:26:16.105
stress and negative events. And as I said before,
this is important because it improves your

00:26:16.105 --> 00:26:24.602
emotional resilience. So, in conclusion,
the state of mental silence is associated

00:26:24.602 --> 00:26:30.435
with relaxed brain activity of deep
attention and positive emotions, it increases

00:26:30.435 --> 00:26:35.614
happy chemicals which stabilize your mood
and your effort and it makes people more

00:26:35.614 --> 00:26:40.739
more detached at the psychological, at
the brain and at the body level.

00:26:42.419 --> 00:26:48.919
Now, what about the effect on your health?
This is a very interesting study by

00:26:48.919 --> 00:26:55.748
Dr. Ramesh Manocha from Australia and he
test the 350 Sahaja yoga meditators and he

00:26:55.748 --> 00:27:01.125
compared them to a group of people, a mixed
group who practiced all sorts of meditation -

00:27:01.125 --> 00:27:06.857
Hatha yoga, Mindfulness meditation and
so on and the Australian normal and the

00:27:06.857 --> 00:27:11.497
normal consisted of thousands of people.
What he found is, the Sahaja yoga meditators

00:27:11.497 --> 00:27:16.801
were better in their general health, in their
social function and in their mental health.

00:27:16.801 --> 00:27:20.842
They weren't better in the physical function
but that's because Sahaja yoga is not a sport.

00:27:21.943 --> 00:27:28.553
Then he tested, what is it what makes them
better? So he tested, is it the hours they meditate,

00:27:28.553 --> 00:27:33.955
is it the amount of mantras they say, is
it how many meetings they attend and

00:27:33.955 --> 00:27:41.592
nothing was related to the benefits other
than one thing and that was the frequency

00:27:41.592 --> 00:27:46.992
of their mental silence. So this is what 
works. And here you see the national average.

00:27:47.472 --> 00:27:53.362
Here you see people who meditate but they
only become thoughtless less than once per

00:27:53.362 --> 00:27:57.969
month - they have no benefit. Here are the
ones who are thoughtless once or twice

00:27:57.969 --> 00:28:03.243
per month - no benefit but here are the
ones who are once or twice thoughtless and

00:28:03.243 --> 00:28:07.743
you see they are significantly better in their
mental health than the National average.

00:28:08.186 --> 00:28:12.936
Here the ones, who are once or twice
per day mentally thoughtless - they are

00:28:12.936 --> 00:28:17.005
also much better and the ones who are
thoughtless several times per day,

00:28:17.005 --> 00:28:22.568
they are, just have an amazing mental health,
as you can see here. So, in conclusion, is

00:28:22.568 --> 00:28:27.764
the state of mental silence which works,
nothing else. But what this means also,

00:28:27.764 --> 00:28:32.434
that means, if you meditate, you need to
find a meditation which teaches you to

00:28:32.434 --> 00:28:37.819
achieve the state of mental silence. So
for example, Mindfulness meditation may be

00:28:37.819 --> 00:28:43.283
very nice but it's not teaching you to empty
your mind, it's not, we're doing mind emptiness;

00:28:43.283 --> 00:28:49.259
Mindfulness is mind fullness - you concentrate
on your thoughts but you really need to have,

00:28:49.259 --> 00:28:54.192
you need to practice the meditation which teaches
you to achieve the state of mental silence

00:28:54.192 --> 00:28:59.546
otherwise you have no health benefits. We
found exactly the same on general health.

00:28:59.546 --> 00:29:03.703
So this is physical and mental health, so
exactly the same. This is the average,

00:29:03.703 --> 00:29:10.003
these are people who are thoughtless several
times per day, a significant improvement of

00:29:10.003 --> 00:29:16.485
their general health and so on. And then
here, if you say and if you meditate for

00:29:16.485 --> 00:29:20.186
years, you never go thoughtless, you
may also not have benefits. So you only

00:29:20.186 --> 00:29:27.619
have to try a bit harder to get there.
Then he measured exactly the same on a

00:29:27.619 --> 00:29:32.186
questionnaire, which picks up anxiety and
depression in the population and what he

00:29:32.186 --> 00:29:37.269
found is the yogis were significantly
less distressed on this questionnaire, so

00:29:37.269 --> 00:29:42.151
they're far less likely to be anxious and
depressed and again the benefits were

00:29:42.151 --> 00:29:47.341
associated with the frequency of the thoughtless
awareness. So here you can see those, who are

00:29:47.341 --> 00:29:53.062
several times per day thoughtless - they
are in very low risker degrees - so these

00:29:53.062 --> 00:30:00.455
people will never become depressed or
anxious and then it goes down so, the less

00:30:00.455 --> 00:30:04.526
often you achieve thoughtless awareness,
the less protected you are against

00:30:04.526 --> 00:30:11.969
depression and anxiety. This is a study
by Simon Guluchekin, where he looked at

00:30:11.969 --> 00:30:18.171
the personality of yogis versus personality
of non-yogis, he found that the meditators are

00:30:18.171 --> 00:30:24.492
significantly less depressed, significantly
less neurotic, have less paranoid thoughts,

00:30:24.492 --> 00:30:30.065
less anxious and less difficulties in
identifying and expressing emotions;

00:30:30.993 --> 00:30:36.893
So these are the long term effects. So, in
conclusion, Sahaja yoga meditation has a

00:30:36.911 --> 00:30:41.571
significant effect on your health but the
benefits are associated with the state of

00:30:41.571 --> 00:30:46.310
mental silence. So that's the key thing
and that's what you should be aiming for -

00:30:46.755 --> 00:30:53.735
the more often the better. Now, what are
the effects on the illness and of course,

00:30:53.735 --> 00:31:00.266
we've seen that in meditation you have
less mental clutter, so obviously your, it

00:31:00.266 --> 00:31:05.293
seems logical that meditators should have better
mental health and this is exactly what has

00:31:05.293 --> 00:31:10.571
been found. This is a study by Dr. Arthur
Morgan, in Exeter University.

00:31:10.571 --> 00:31:16.182
He took a group of people with depression
and he gave them Sahaja yoga meditation

00:31:16.182 --> 00:31:21.785
nothing or the treatment you get and
energies called cognitive behavior therapy

00:31:21.785 --> 00:31:25.944
and this treatment is supposed to work
but in this study it didn't work but

00:31:25.944 --> 00:31:30.490
Sahaja yoga meditation worked significantly
better, as you can see and that was only

00:31:30.490 --> 00:31:35.815
significant improvement, so the depressed
people became significantly less anxious

00:31:35.815 --> 00:31:41.325
after six weeks of Sahaja yoga meditation,
less depressed and they have less

00:31:41.325 --> 00:31:50.063
general mental illness. This is a study on
anxiety by Dr. Chung from Philadelphia University

00:31:50.063 --> 00:31:57.663
and she gave sixty-six Sahaja yoga meditators
and controls. They had, she gave the meditators

00:31:57.663 --> 00:32:03.339
very intensive one week treatment in the
meditation hospital and as you can see,

00:32:03.339 --> 00:32:08.371
the meditators significantly improved in
their anxiety while the controls got their

00:32:08.371 --> 00:32:13.197
normal hospital treatment and they actually
became worse and the difference was, of course,

00:32:13.197 --> 00:32:18.675
highly significant. So, meditation was much
better than the traditional hospital treatment,

00:32:18.675 --> 00:32:24.603
which actually made them worse. This is a
study on work stress and as you know,

00:32:24.603 --> 00:32:28.459
we're all quite stressed at work and it's
a big problem; Work stress is associated

00:32:28.459 --> 00:32:34.178
with a lot of health problems. In this
study, Dr. Ramesh Manocha from Australia,

00:32:34.178 --> 00:32:41.498
he tested people. He gave them 8 weeks
of Sahaja yoga meditation or he gave them

00:32:41.498 --> 00:32:47.128
relaxation response and relaxation response
is something which is used in TM. So, as you

00:32:47.128 --> 00:32:52.054
can see the relaxation response have no
effect, so it didn't make them better but

00:32:52.054 --> 00:32:57.476
Sahaja yoga meditation made these people
were stressed at work, significantly better,

00:32:57.476 --> 00:33:02.690
so the stress symptoms became significantly
better, so these are all improvements, of course.

00:33:02.690 --> 00:33:07.428
The depression became significantly better
and the anxiety being quite insignificant

00:33:07.428 --> 00:33:10.952
but as you can see, they're also better,
in the anxiety.

00:33:12.921 --> 00:33:18.311
This is a study on ADHD, Attention Deficit
Hyperactivity Disorder, so these are children,

00:33:18.311 --> 00:33:23.853
who are restless, impulsive and have problems
with attention. So of course we thought that,

00:33:23.853 --> 00:33:29.106
meditation would be quick because it makes
them calmer and it improves attention and

00:33:29.106 --> 00:33:35.079
we've seen it enhances attention areas.
And in practice this what happens, so

00:33:35.079 --> 00:33:40.568
these people got 6 weeks, they were children,
they got 6 weeks of Sahaja yoga meditation

00:33:40.568 --> 00:33:45.840
together with their parents and they improved
significantly in their ADHD symptoms.

00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:50.546
What is interesting, that the effect was
similar to that of stimular medication.

00:33:50.546 --> 00:33:55.905
Hyperactive children normally get Ritalin and
it improves the symptoms but it has side effects,

00:33:55.905 --> 00:34:01.382
so it affects the sleep, it affects the
growth and of course, if you can have an

00:34:01.382 --> 00:34:06.473
improvement without any side effects through
meditation, then that's better, specially

00:34:06.473 --> 00:34:12.828
in a child which has still has a developing
brain. And they all improved although most

00:34:12.828 --> 00:34:17.421
of them even stopped their Ritalin, their
medication. Although they stopped or

00:34:17.421 --> 00:34:20.839
reduced the medication, they
still improved significantly.

00:34:22.249 --> 00:34:28.069
This is a study on drug consumption. This
is done by Dr. Wolfen Hackell from Austria

00:34:28.069 --> 00:34:34.691
so he tested people who entered meditation
and he followed them up for a year and

00:34:34.691 --> 00:34:40.010
asked them questions about their drug use.
What is quite interesting is, that after

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:46.626
only one week almost 60% of drug users
stopped their drug consumption; This is really

00:34:46.626 --> 00:34:50.647
remarkable because they were partly, some
of them were Heroin abusers, Cocaine,

00:34:51.282 --> 00:34:58.383
Amphetamines and what they found that
after a year only 7% still took their drugs

00:34:58.628 --> 00:35:04.368
and, you know, I work in a mental hospital
I insist there is no drug, there is no

00:35:04.368 --> 00:35:09.094
treatment which works as well as this. So,
this is really quite remarkable,

00:35:09.094 --> 00:35:11.748
you don't find this anywhere else.

00:35:14.789 --> 00:35:19.769
So what about physical illness? I've shown
you before that meditation enhances the

00:35:19.769 --> 00:35:24.144
Para Sympathetic Nervous System which
restores your bodily functions and of course,

00:35:24.144 --> 00:35:29.620
this should have an effect on your physical
body and this is exactly what has been shown.

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:34.052
Again this is a study by Dr. Chung, which
I've shown you before, where people with

00:35:34.052 --> 00:35:38.318
Hypertension significantly improved
with one week of intensive meditation.

00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:45.630
There have been several studies in India
who've shown that people improved with Epilepsy

00:35:45.630 --> 00:35:50.176
and Epilepsy is quite a severe disease -
you have epileptic attacks quite frequently

00:35:50.176 --> 00:35:57.355
and you have to take quite severe drugs
with severe side effects. In these studies

00:35:57.355 --> 00:36:02.507
what all of them showed that the number
of epileptic attacks can be significantly

00:36:02.507 --> 00:36:08.973
reduced with meditation. So this is after
3 months and this is after 6 months.

00:36:12.207 --> 00:36:18.257
This is a study by Dr. Ramesh Manocha,
from Australia and he found that meditation

00:36:18.257 --> 00:36:24.666
has a significant effect on asthma. These
people meditated for 2 months, two times weekly -

00:36:24.666 --> 00:36:30.152
and the asthma you can measure in a objective
way - they had a significant reduction

00:36:30.152 --> 00:36:38.002
of the asthma in the cases of the severity
of the asthma. What is interesting about

00:36:38.002 --> 00:36:42.862
this study is that after 2 months they
stopped the treatment and meditation and

00:36:42.862 --> 00:36:47.491
then he followed them up after another
month and what happens is, after the month

00:36:47.491 --> 00:36:51.726
when they stopped the meditation they all went
back to the same severity of asthma they

00:36:51.726 --> 00:36:57.558
had before. So what it means is, if you use
meditation to cure any of your illnesses

00:36:57.558 --> 00:37:02.271
or diseases, you have to do it for life. You
have to do it regularly and you can't just

00:37:02.271 --> 00:37:08.334
stop when you notice your some health benefits
because they will come back. So meditation

00:37:08.334 --> 00:37:13.910
really, is a discipline for life and I think
that's the reason why, few people use it because

00:37:13.910 --> 00:37:19.923
you have to do it regularly and for ever, if you
want to have the benefits and some people

00:37:19.923 --> 00:37:24.449
find it easier to, you know, to take a pill
than to actually sit down 15 minutes in

00:37:24.449 --> 00:37:29.982
the morning 15 minutes in the evening and
get yourself disciplined and go into meditation.

00:37:29.982 --> 00:37:38.059
But as you see, it's as effective as drugs.
This is a study on menopause and again

00:37:38.059 --> 00:37:43.386
there was a significant reduction of the hot
flushes in women in the menopause phase.

00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:47.807
What is interesting that the effect was
similar to Hormone Replacement Therapy and

00:37:47.807 --> 00:37:53.008
Hormone Replacement Therapy has been
associated with increased Cancer risk. So again,

00:37:53.008 --> 00:37:57.031
if you can avoid the Cancer risk, it's
better to use meditation.

00:37:59.339 --> 00:38:03.539
So in conclusion, Sahaja yoga meditation
has a significant

00:38:03.539 --> 00:38:06.689
beneficial effect on your mental
and your physical health.

00:38:09.315 --> 00:38:15.235
So to conclude, I've shown you that Sahaja
yoga meditation has a significant effect

00:38:15.235 --> 00:38:20.216
on the body because it activates the Para
Sympathetic Nervous System and restores

00:38:20.216 --> 00:38:25.644
your bodily functions. It has an affect on the
brain. It's a different state of consciousness -

00:38:25.644 --> 00:38:30.813
you activate areas of attention, you activate
the Limbic areas which give you happiness

00:38:30.813 --> 00:38:36.966
and you release good, happy, more
stabilizing neuro-chemicals in your brain.

00:38:38.408 --> 00:38:44.848
It prevents disease because it gives you
better mental and physical health. It's a

00:38:44.848 --> 00:38:49.693
disease therapy, so if you have any illnesses,
you can use it to treat your illnesses through

00:38:49.693 --> 00:38:54.805
regular meditation and as I said, as I showed
you, it has an effect on a range of mental

00:38:54.805 --> 00:39:00.947
illnesses and physical illnesses and there has
never been any negative affect, all the effect

00:39:00.947 --> 00:39:07.330
was being positive. What is important, as I
said before is, the benefits are associated

00:39:07.330 --> 00:39:11.282
with the state of mental silence, so it's
the mental silence which works and nothing

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:15.898
else, so if you meditate, you have to try
to achieve the state of mental silence

00:39:15.898 --> 00:39:22.909
as often as possible and that will be associated
with better health at a mental and physical level.

00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:31.070
So, I think I've talked enough and what we
will do now is, we'll have a meditation

00:39:31.070 --> 00:39:36.425
guided by the founder of Sahaja yoga and
if you follow my last slide, we will go

00:39:36.425 --> 00:39:41.417
exactly there into the Limbic system, which is
here, which is also where the last slide is

00:39:41.417 --> 00:39:45.408
and that's where we're going now, so
you've heard about all the fantastic things

00:39:45.408 --> 00:39:49.990
which can happen to you and hopefully you
feel today this mental silence where we're

00:39:49.990 --> 00:39:55.262
going to go now, which is the Kingdom of God
within, the Paradise within, which you can have.

00:39:56.105 --> 00:40:01.265
Here we go. And if you want to know more,
they are a fewer pages where you can read

00:40:01.265 --> 00:40:07.956
a bit more about this yoga. [UNCLEAR]
[APPLAUSE] Well done!
