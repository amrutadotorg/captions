1
00:00:08,020 --> 00:00:13,520
Now, what we can do is to, Philip,

2
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:16,640
what should I tell you the practical side,

3
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:19,000
the meditation. All right?

4
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:25,222
Let's see what this meditation is, what We have to do on a meditation.

5
00:00:27,926 --> 00:00:32,560
The first thing we have got is the left side

6
00:00:32,660 --> 00:00:38,640
is the Mana-Shakti, is the power of your emotions. All right?

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:44,880
Now, emotions are connected with your right side, also -- prana.

8
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:47,480
Say for example if you are emotionally disturbed,

9
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:50,080
just now we got disturbed,

10
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:56,160
so our shva, our breathing also increased

11
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,480
and we felt the whole body was sort of, say reacting

12
00:01:01,580 --> 00:01:08,000
and the, we were feeling the reaction of the Prana, right side also.

13
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:10,120
That it was trying to express itself.

14
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:14,160
Like we started the tears, is the water-element

15
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:19,160
and all that came in and the whole emotion was so much pouring out

16
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:27,200
and with that our Prana was also involved.

17
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,680
Say for example if you are frightened,

18
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:33,880
if you are frightened

19
00:01:33,980 --> 00:01:37,880
if you are frightened too much then what happens?

20
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:41,840
If you are frightened than also you get your breathing

21
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:43,040
very fast -- isn't it?

22
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,140
So it is connected.

23
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,830
So it is connected. If you are frightened it is connected

24
00:01:50,933 --> 00:01:54,720
with your Prana, in your breathing

25
00:01:54,820 --> 00:02:04,260
and your whole system is connected with your emotions, physical system.

26
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:09,800
If you cry too much, or if you weep too much, or if you are a sad person

27
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:12,920
that shows on your face, your Vishuddhi-Chakra also shows,

28
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:15,480
and not only Anahata but also Vishuddhi.

29
00:02:15,580 --> 00:02:18,400
Then also your Agnya goes out.

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,840
So all the Chakras reflect the left side

31
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,880
in such a way that physical manifestation is also there.

32
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:30,160
So it proofs that both are very much connected.

33
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:35,920
So to, if you have to, somehow or other,

34
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:38,960
dissolve these two sides within us,

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,280
the left and the right side

36
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,520
because if you do not dissolve it,  you are left half way here

37
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:47,600
so you have to dissolve these two things.

38
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:51,560
And to dissolve these, what should we do?

39
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:55,860
What can we do -- in meditation?

40
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,500
Can you suggest?

41
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:05,500
Say we have got Prana and Mana.

42
00:03:05,678 --> 00:03:12,452
Now Prana represents the right side and the Mana-Shakti is the left side.

43
00:03:12,646 --> 00:03:17,712
All right? These two have to be dissolved -- in the air, means dissolved.

44
00:03:17,847 --> 00:03:21,360
Now how do we do it? To dissolve these two things,

45
00:03:21,460 --> 00:03:24,451
they are connected with each other.

46
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:30,728
After realization, not before.

47
00:03:40,953 --> 00:03:45,549
So before meditation we give ourselves a balance, all right?

48
00:03:45,628 --> 00:03:48,801
This side is more, this side is less. At the time.

49
00:03:48,849 --> 00:03:51,493
Supposing you are emotionally -- at that time -- disturbed,

50
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:54,072
then you put your right to the left.

51
00:03:54,222 --> 00:03:57,342
If you are that time disturbed on the left side

52
00:03:58,705 --> 00:04:03,913
I mean disturbed in that sense that if a left side is frozen,

53
00:04:04,064 --> 00:04:09,021
then you raise your left side and give yourself a balance before meditation.

54
00:04:09,234 --> 00:04:12,830
Now let us see, which side is less, first of all.

55
00:04:12,901 --> 00:04:17,200
Put your hands like that.

56
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:22,000
Are you all right? Getting cool breeze? Getting it?

57
00:04:22,100 --> 00:05:06,780
(Shri Mataji speaks to a little girl)

58
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:16,286
So once you have given yourself a balance

59
00:05:16,425 --> 00:05:24,388
then the best thing is to pay attention to your emotions,

60
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:28,150
to Manas-Shakti. Watch them.

61
00:05:28,245 --> 00:05:35,182
You can enlighten your emotions by thinking of your Mother. All right.

62
00:05:35,282 --> 00:05:37,417
Just enlighten them.

63
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:43,685
Just She will solve the problem. Whatever are the problems in the Mana, all right?

64
00:05:43,828 --> 00:05:50,400
So once you get connected with those emotions

65
00:05:50,515 --> 00:05:59,035
and you start looking at them in your meditation

66
00:06:00,289 --> 00:06:05,769
you will see these emotions are rising within you

67
00:06:06,504 --> 00:06:12,104
and if you try to put these emotions on your Mother,

68
00:06:12,186 --> 00:06:15,586
as they say at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother,

69
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:20,666
they will start also dissolving those emotions

70
00:06:20,793 --> 00:06:29,240
and they'll become sort of -- ah -- expanded. Expanded, you see.

71
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,920
You will extern that in such a way that

72
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:36,360
you will feel you are in control, these emotions.

73
00:06:36,460 --> 00:06:40,280
You are in control of them and by that controlling those emotions

74
00:06:40,896 --> 00:06:45,896
your emotions -- which are expanded, enlightened -- are powerful.

75
00:06:46,413 --> 00:06:52,705
And these emotions, when you feel that way,

76
00:06:52,919 --> 00:06:58,639
then the cause of those emotions can be solved.

77
00:06:58,908 --> 00:07:02,577
For example just now you got emotionally stirred up

78
00:07:02,656 --> 00:07:06,920
because I talked about -- say -- these children.

79
00:07:07,313 --> 00:07:09,964
Naturally, anybody would be.

80
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,160
Now when you are stirred up with that you put that problem

81
00:07:15,272 --> 00:07:18,135
and those feelings that are rising in you,

82
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:23,116
that those waves of feelings that are coming at the Lotus-Feet of your Mother.

83
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:29,200
So they get touched, say by that power you can say.

84
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:32,340
Then these emotions become enlightened

85
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,560
and when these emotions become enlightened

86
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:42,400
they have a power to solve the problem. Do you see the point?

87
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:45,512
As if they had reached the shore where they got the light

88
00:07:45,584 --> 00:07:48,824
and this problem can be solved.

89
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:52,637
Because now you are not in an individual cell,

90
00:07:52,725 --> 00:07:55,724
you are in the expanse, you are in the samashti

91
00:07:55,772 --> 00:07:58,343
and because you have entered into that position,

92
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,257
that's why you have got these powers of entering to another person's body,

93
00:08:02,312 --> 00:08:04,852
to see the vibrations of another person,

94
00:08:04,905 --> 00:08:09,352
to raise the Kundalini. Otherwise you could not have done it.

95
00:08:10,074 --> 00:08:14,800
So for you it is very easy because I am also sitting here in person.

96
00:08:14,900 --> 00:08:18,360
So easy to put these emotions just there

97
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:22,080
so that they get enlightened and your wish is fulfilled,

98
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:30,785
because emotions are nothing but wishes. These are unfulfilled wishes.

99
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:38,540
Now how they do it? Otherwise is also this way that you take up these emotions

100
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:49,600
and put them, so that is, these emotions are actually -- the left side,

101
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:53,680
as I said, is the desire.

102
00:08:53,780 --> 00:09:00,767
So the desire is taken, any desire, and is put in the Prana.

103
00:09:00,856 --> 00:09:04,076
Now how do you put it on the Prana?

104
00:09:04,219 --> 00:09:09,260
That you control your Prana -- that's why they do Prana-yamas, you see?

105
00:09:09,580 --> 00:09:13,880
Like you sit down now, very comfortably,

106
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:16,000
now you have a desire, you put your attention to that.

107
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,440
Attention is very important -- you see?

108
00:09:18,548 --> 00:09:27,508
Now this attention is to be put onto the Prana,

109
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:31,880
so the emotions are there

110
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:37,145
and then bring those emotions and put them into your attention,

111
00:09:37,201 --> 00:09:42,520
means they are now, you are aware of them.

112
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:47,760
Now what you do is to watch your breathing. See now,

113
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:56,851
try to reduce your breathing, reduce it.

114
00:09:59,094 --> 00:10:08,220
In the sense that you have breathed out, wait for a while, then breath in

115
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:16,020
for a long time. Then you breathe out.

116
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:21,040
So in one minute your breezing will be less than normal.

117
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:24,528
All right? Try that. Breathe in.

118
00:10:24,616 --> 00:10:28,872
now with the emotions, keep the attention on the emotions -- you see?

119
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:32,701
so that the connection is established.

120
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:08,741
Hmm. Better? You see the Kundalini rises?

121
00:11:11,380 --> 00:11:16,480
Now when you are breathing you find that there is a space in-between,

122
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:18,780
which you just leave it vacant.

123
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:21,800
Breathe in!

124
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:25,040
Now leave it vacant.

125
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,860
Now breathe out.

126
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,900
Now leave it vacant.

127
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:40,703
Breathe in. Keep it there.

128
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:48,900
Then leave it.

129
00:11:51,177 --> 00:11:55,543
Keep out-side. Now breathe in.

130
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:09,420
Now start breathing in such a way that you stop your breathing.

131
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:35,820
Your attention should be on the heart, or could be on the emotions.

132
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:46,020
It's better.

133
00:12:50,588 --> 00:12:53,908
Keep the breathing inside for a while,

134
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:58,720
then bring it out, then outside for a while.

135
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:03,643
Then again, then you'll find that for a while you will not breathe.

136
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:20,940
Hmm. You see, you settle down. The Laya takes place between your Prana and your Mana.

137
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:25,020
Both the Shaktis become one.

138
00:13:26,429 --> 00:13:34,869
Now at this stage when you are silent, now you think of your intellect.

139
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:42,140
It's lost.

140
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:45,480
Now just think of it, it's lost, it's no more there.

141
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:50,040
So what is happening, actually that this Laya -- the attention

142
00:13:50,198 --> 00:13:55,267
goes into the intellect and enlightens t

143
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,660
Aha, now see, the thought is not there -- try to find your intellect within yourself!

144
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:19,260
Now see! See, where is my intellect? Try to find it!

145
00:14:21,380 --> 00:14:28,220
It's not there, it's not working. Again try it!

146
00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:32,760
It is working, but it has become the samashti,

147
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:36,220
has become the collective now.

148
00:14:37,780 --> 00:14:39,923
Ha! See now!

149
00:14:50,104 --> 00:14:52,784
See now. Did you follow that?

150
00:14:56,980 --> 00:14:59,260
There is no thought.

151
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,762
This exercise will give you this thoughtless awareness,

152
00:15:05,809 --> 00:15:09,460
establishes in you the thoughtless awareness. There is no thought.
