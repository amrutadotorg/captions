1
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,500
You can hear me there? All of you?

2
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:19,500
Those you can't hear me raise your hand

3
00:00:32,291 --> 00:00:34,500
Alright! thank you

4
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:56,500
So you better sing one song

5
00:00:58,125 --> 00:01:06,417
I'm sorry ,they told me now that people waiting

6
00:01:25,417 --> 00:01:30,417
"The Music of Joy"
"Ayi Singha Pe Sawar, Maiya"

7
00:08:35,417 --> 00:08:41,417
Very nice to see you all so happy here.

8
00:08:43,667 --> 00:08:46,750
Today is the second day

9
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:59,500
and is a very important day from the point of evolution.

10
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:13,417
As you know that our second chakra is very important.

11
00:09:14,667 --> 00:09:18,125
That's why today is very important.

12
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,375
So what is the second chakra?

13
00:09:22,667 --> 00:09:25,875
Do you know which one is the second chakra?

14
00:09:30,875 --> 00:09:32,583
Ah? What did they say?

15
00:09:44,875 --> 00:09:47,125
You must tell loudly.

16
00:09:53,125 --> 00:09:59,125
Swadisthan is the chakra, is very important because

17
00:09:59,417 --> 00:10:06,125
in this Kali Yuga, Swadisthana works the most.

18
00:10:06,417 --> 00:10:13,583
We have so many agents to make it work

19
00:10:13,875 --> 00:10:19,333
to make it work and work very hard.

20
00:10:19,792 --> 00:10:23,125
You know what is in second chakra.

21
00:10:24,792 --> 00:10:30,417
In the second chakra what happens

22
00:10:31,667 --> 00:10:35,875
that we are caught up by our ambition

23
00:10:37,875 --> 00:10:41,417
and the ambition makes you run up and down,

24
00:10:41,667 --> 00:10:47,333
and I've seen many Sahaja Yogis also getting lost,

25
00:10:47,583 --> 00:10:52,875
so it's a very important day for all of you.

26
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:01,667
So second chakra is important because

27
00:11:02,041 --> 00:11:06,041
in modern times it is very, very

28
00:11:06,333 --> 00:11:10,792
cosmic as well as active.

29
00:11:13,125 --> 00:11:15,709
We become very active, over active,

30
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:25,125
and we start thinking about everyone with whom we are not concerned

31
00:11:25,709 --> 00:11:28,792
and bothering our heads.

32
00:11:29,125 --> 00:11:34,542
So today's chakra is important because it bothers your head,

33
00:11:35,792 --> 00:11:37,583
it troubles you a lot

34
00:11:37,875 --> 00:11:40,583
and you start thinking about them.

35
00:11:43,125 --> 00:11:49,041
You start thinking what have you said, what has happened,

36
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:53,041
who is angry, all sorts of nonsense.

37
00:11:55,333 --> 00:11:57,458
You are all Sahaja yogis,

38
00:11:58,583 --> 00:12:01,709
so you shouldn't worry as to all these people,

39
00:12:02,041 --> 00:12:03,709
what they say, what they are doing.

40
00:12:04,041 --> 00:12:08,250
You should just enjoy yourself.

41
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,709
Second chakra you must enjoy.

42
00:12:12,041 --> 00:12:15,792
That's the best way to enjoy Sahaja Yoga.

43
00:12:19,917 --> 00:12:22,917
Where your Swadisthana is satisfied

44
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:28,542
nothing can destroy you or disturb you.

45
00:12:29,458 --> 00:12:33,542
At Swadisthana you can really look after;

46
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:39,208
Swadisthan Chakra is so much good for you because

47
00:12:39,542 --> 00:12:44,625
now you are Sahaja Yogis and you can master it.

48
00:12:44,917 --> 00:12:50,041
That is one chakra which upsets, especially in the West

49
00:12:50,333 --> 00:12:52,542
people think too much, all the time

50
00:12:52,792 --> 00:12:54,625
thinking, thinking, thinking.

51
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,333
That's from Swadisthan,

52
00:12:58,625 --> 00:13:03,041
you get that problem from Swadisthan.

53
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:08,917
To satisfy Swadisthan, you have to take to silence.

54
00:13:10,250 --> 00:13:17,709
You have to take to quietude and look at yourself.

55
00:13:18,041 --> 00:13:24,166
What is bothering you, what is troubling you,

56
00:13:24,458 --> 00:13:27,542
what gives you ideas and thoughts

57
00:13:27,834 --> 00:13:30,041
is Swadisthan.

58
00:13:30,375 --> 00:13:33,041
And some people think so much.

59
00:13:36,375 --> 00:13:39,542
There may not be any problem,

60
00:13:39,834 --> 00:13:43,917
but they create their own problem with the Swadisthana

61
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:49,458
and just go on bothering about the stuff.

62
00:13:49,709 --> 00:13:53,542
Swadisthan is very happy

63
00:13:53,834 --> 00:13:56,709
when you are just laughing and enjoying

64
00:13:57,083 --> 00:14:00,083
and not bothered about nonsense.

65
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:03,959
How much time we waste on nonsense!

66
00:14:05,166 --> 00:14:06,917
We don't need it,

67
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,458
Sahaja Yogis don't need it.

68
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:13,375
It's only those who are not yet realized

69
00:14:13,667 --> 00:14:20,458
must be suffering. They do suffer
and they might even trouble you, but just laugh at it

70
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:27,834
and you must pardon them, forgive them, because they are doing this

71
00:14:29,083 --> 00:14:33,250
because they can't help it.

72
00:14:34,583 --> 00:14:39,583
You see, this Swadisthan Chakra is bothering them

73
00:14:39,834 --> 00:14:41,375
so they can't help it.

74
00:14:42,375 --> 00:14:44,625
You don't have space.

75
00:14:44,917 --> 00:14:47,834
Come forward a little bit, poor man.

76
00:14:51,375 --> 00:14:52,750
I'm sorry.

77
00:15:00,083 --> 00:15:03,291
You can come forward, here there is seat,

78
00:15:03,583 --> 00:15:06,458
some people make room for them.

79
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:26,583
Ah good, and move forward, please.

80
00:15:27,166 --> 00:15:30,583
You bring your harmonium and you come forward.

81
00:15:41,375 --> 00:15:45,583
Are you going to dance? Good.

82
00:16:13,834 --> 00:16:17,166
So now, don't allow your mind

83
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:21,291
to bother about whatever nonsensical thoughts are coming

84
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:26,792
- all kinds of, all kinds of nonsensical thoughts.

85
00:16:27,041 --> 00:16:31,500
You have nothing to do with them, but the thoughts are coming

86
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:35,834
Now, this is the work of Mister Swadisthan.

87
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,375
He's trying to distract you,

88
00:16:40,625 --> 00:16:42,917
you must get into silence.

89
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:48,291
Once you get into silence,

90
00:16:49,583 --> 00:16:53,750
then he will go away and don't bother you.

91
00:16:56,208 --> 00:17:02,834
My all attention is on your country

92
00:17:03,208 --> 00:17:06,834
because you're very good Sahaja Yogis.

93
00:17:08,208 --> 00:17:12,500
We have had Sahaja Yogis all over the world,

94
00:17:12,750 --> 00:17:14,583
you know in thousands they are,

95
00:17:14,834 --> 00:17:18,583
but nothing like Australian, I see.

96
00:17:19,834 --> 00:17:26,750
Because they are somehow or other very deeply touched

97
00:17:27,083 --> 00:17:31,667
and bothered about the world problems.

98
00:17:33,917 --> 00:17:35,917
So what you have to think now:

99
00:17:36,291 --> 00:17:40,208
not to have anything to do with Swadisthan,

100
00:17:40,583 --> 00:17:43,500
but what you have to become

101
00:17:43,750 --> 00:17:46,667
is you are Sahaja Yogis

102
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,750
and no Swadisthan should bother you.

103
00:18:10,083 --> 00:18:13,667
So there was â€¦
I never knew that you were all here,

104
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,208
now only they told Me that you were all here.

105
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,000
They said, "Only a few people are there."

106
00:18:19,291 --> 00:18:21,000
I said, "All right."

107
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,875
Ah? How many? You have counted them?

108
00:18:53,875 --> 00:18:54,875
Now, very sweet,

109
00:18:59,208 --> 00:19:05,000
Australia is really great to have beautiful children like this.

110
00:19:08,291 --> 00:19:11,208
And people care for children.

111
00:19:11,500 --> 00:19:15,000
That is first thing you must do is to care for your children.

112
00:19:15,417 --> 00:19:19,125
That is fighting your Swadisthan.

113
00:19:20,417 --> 00:19:22,417
Anything bothers you,

114
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:25,208
you worry about you own children, finished.

115
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:34,417
You have to bother about them and everything will work out.

116
00:19:41,125 --> 00:19:43,417
"What's the matter, are you not are all right?

117
00:19:45,667 --> 00:19:47,417
You are all right?"

118
00:20:17,667 --> 00:20:20,417
You are definitely blessed

119
00:20:20,667 --> 00:20:26,208
because you are not falling to the whims of your Swadisthan.

120
00:20:27,583 --> 00:20:34,583
Definitely, and that is the chakra of your country also.

121
00:20:34,875 --> 00:20:41,417
So it makes you run up and down and think and think and think.

122
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:47,208
Especially all the Sahaja Yogis have this problem.

123
00:20:47,542 --> 00:20:51,333
So you should just think

124
00:20:51,583 --> 00:20:55,792
that you are sitting on Swadisthan

125
00:20:56,125 --> 00:21:05,041
and you have to ride it, not to be ridden by it. All right?

126
00:21:13,333 --> 00:21:20,125
I'm so proud of you people from this country

127
00:21:20,417 --> 00:21:24,125
have shown path to the rest of the world

128
00:21:24,417 --> 00:21:29,125
how can you be united and to be one.

129
00:21:30,417 --> 00:21:32,875
It's rather very surprising.

130
00:21:33,417 --> 00:21:37,125
In other countries the problem is different.

131
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:43,417
Your country is the problem of Swadisthana as I said today,

132
00:21:43,709 --> 00:21:46,792
but you people have conquered it.

133
00:21:50,125 --> 00:21:52,250
When I came first year I found

134
00:21:52,542 --> 00:21:55,125
everybody's head moving with the Swadisthana.

135
00:21:57,417 --> 00:22:01,542
Then they became silent and very peaceful

136
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:06,041
and now I see you all and I'm very happy

137
00:22:06,333 --> 00:22:09,333
because that's gone now,

138
00:22:09,583 --> 00:22:11,875
all that nonsense is finished.

139
00:22:12,250 --> 00:22:15,458
And there is nothing bothers you.

140
00:22:22,709 --> 00:22:26,583
The root of all diseases is Swadisthan,

141
00:22:26,917 --> 00:22:28,917
it comes from there.

142
00:22:32,250 --> 00:22:35,917
So you should know not to play into hands of Swadisthan

143
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:41,250
and go into thinking, thinking, thinking.

144
00:22:41,542 --> 00:22:45,709
They go on thinking, I mean something that doesn't exist,

145
00:22:45,792 --> 00:22:47,542
they go on thinking.

146
00:22:51,041 --> 00:22:53,458
So any such thought comes in you said,

147
00:22:53,709 --> 00:22:56,583
"We don't want to think," finished.

148
00:22:57,041 --> 00:23:00,583
I'm there to think for you,

149
00:23:00,917 --> 00:23:02,917
you don't think.

150
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,458
If you have any problem, you let Me know,

151
00:23:06,709 --> 00:23:09,917
but you don't think.

152
00:23:12,250 --> 00:23:17,709
What you can do, you can write it down and send the problems to Me

153
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:21,792
and I would like to see it. All right?

154
00:23:29,166 --> 00:23:35,792
And then Swadisthana is chakra of your country,

155
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:42,041
that is the second chakra and is here.

156
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:45,625
And you'll be amazed to know

157
00:23:45,959 --> 00:23:56,917
that Sahaja Yogis there are from every country,
but Australian ones are something special.

158
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:02,375
They have very great faith in themselves.

159
00:24:05,458 --> 00:24:09,917
They do not go to wrong ideas.

160
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:13,375
I've seen that,

161
00:24:13,625 --> 00:24:16,709
and I am very much thankful to you for that.

162
00:24:23,458 --> 00:24:27,709
So what other song you want to sing? I would like to hear.

163
00:24:51,250 --> 00:24:55,709
"The Music of Joy"
"Mata Oh Mata"
