00:17:38.539 --> 00:17:43.340
Sahaja Yogi(Mr. Warren) - Your Holiness
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, people of Delhi

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:49.435
and to my foreign brothers and sisters,
who are here visiting this great
country of India -

00:17:49.537 --> 00:17:55.867
It's so beautiful to hear that earnest
yearning to be one with God,

00:17:55.907 --> 00:18:04.407
that earnest bhakti that, "Please give me
the union, please give me the blessings
of the God," -

00:18:05.423 --> 00:18:10.568
this is something which in the West
we're not so accustomed to,

00:18:11.758 --> 00:18:16.333
and yet, perhaps here in India, we take it
a little for granted.

00:18:18.946 --> 00:18:25.106
Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi has so many
attributes - I don't know where to begin

00:18:25.106 --> 00:18:29.924
but probably the best starting place
and probably the best finishing place

00:18:30.507 --> 00:18:39.537
is, that She is here, in person. That Shri
Mataji is here to give us those blessings,

00:18:39.537 --> 00:18:45.210
about which, we as the bhaktas in our
past lives have been singing again
and again.

00:18:45.915 --> 00:18:49.880
She's here to give us the blessings
of our Atmasakshat,

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:59.240
She's here to awaken that subtle energy
which lies within us, which gives us
our second birth,

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:06.165
She's here to fulfill all the promises, not
only of the Hindu Scriptures but of the
Christian Scriptures,

00:19:06.165 --> 00:19:15.070
the Muslim Scriptures and all the other
great Incarnations, who come on this
earth to advance us spiritually

00:19:15.070 --> 00:19:22.362
in our quest for God. So what we must
be mindful of and always remember

00:19:22.460 --> 00:19:32.350
during this lifetime is that, here we have
in person, Somebody who can actually
give us

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:37.330
that achievement that we have been
searching for, for so many births.

00:19:37.606 --> 00:19:42.576
It's very difficult for our rational mind
to accept that point.

00:19:42.576 --> 00:19:48.107
It's very difficult, in other words, for our
egos to surrender to that extent and
say,

00:19:48.137 --> 00:19:55.447
"Perhaps here we have met, that which
fulfills all our seeking."

00:19:55.807 --> 00:20:04.877
Shri Mataji claims nothing. She's here
as a Mother. We believe in our hearts

00:20:04.877 --> 00:20:12.430
and from all the inner knowings that we
have, that She is the Incarnation
of Adishakti -

00:20:13.184 --> 00:20:21.704
but She claims nothing. She does one
thing. She gives us the love of God
in it's pure form.

00:20:21.967 --> 00:20:29.767
She gives us that awakening of the
Kundalini, which gives us the union
about which we've been reading

00:20:29.872 --> 00:20:35.212
singing our prayers, searching for,
for so many births.

00:20:36.242 --> 00:20:41.172
And when we get that Self-realization,
we begin to become a very
dynamic person.

00:20:41.898 --> 00:20:50.398
We start to become aware of the reality
of Science. If I'm a doctor and I know a
little about the Central Nervous system,

00:20:50.465 --> 00:20:55.805
I can say with confidence that, that
Central Nervous system becomes
enlightened within us.

00:20:57.216 --> 00:21:02.330
The Parasympathetic Nervous System,
in particular, becomes dominant

00:21:02.330 --> 00:21:10.237
and we start monitoring our own subtle
being within us; But that's looking at a
rather gross aspect.

00:21:10.969 --> 00:21:15.979
At a subtler level within us we start to
feel the joy of Almighty God.

00:21:15.991 --> 00:21:22.511
We start to feel the blessings of God -
feel - not intellectually perceive but feel.

00:21:22.572 --> 00:21:28.242
We begin to be drenched with that
'anon' about which so many people
have written,

00:21:28.248 --> 00:21:33.698
about which so many lectures have
been given and now we begin to feel it.

00:21:33.699 --> 00:21:39.969
We watch Her giving Self-realization to
thousands and thousands of people,

00:21:40.114 --> 00:21:45.204
in the villages and towns of Maharashtra
where She's conducting tours each year -

00:21:45.239 --> 00:21:53.399
200 of us have been travelling with Her
for two months through the highways
and by-ways of that part of India,

00:21:53.399 --> 00:21:58.319
where we have watched literally whole
villages; five-six-seven thousand people

00:21:58.386 --> 00:22:07.446
gain their Self-realization at one session.
To see the flood of hands - "Yes,
I'm feeling the Brahmshakti;"

00:22:07.499 --> 00:22:12.459
"Yes, this is it! This is the reality that I
have been seeking for so long."

00:22:12.606 --> 00:22:17.666
We witness this great event and
we bow at Her lotus feet.

00:22:17.689 --> 00:22:26.490
In the West, because we've been so
damaged, because we've gone into the
highways and byways in our seeking,

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:32.131
because the gurus have ripped our
spiritual essence with their falsity,

00:22:32.131 --> 00:22:36.791
because we have earnestly sought this
way and that way, often very stupidly

00:22:36.791 --> 00:22:45.223
and very foolishly but honestly, we get
our realization. Kundalini Herself rises

00:22:45.223 --> 00:22:50.742
through very badly damaged chakras -
but She ascends, She puts us in touch,

00:22:50.742 --> 00:22:57.622
She makes the connection and we
begin that final ascent into the
Kingdom of God,

00:22:57.732 --> 00:23:03.853
we enter the Kingdom of God, we pass
through the door - the Brahmarandhra

00:23:04.228 --> 00:23:11.798
and when that takes place, the
transformation begins. Each one of us
becomes a total being,

00:23:11.924 --> 00:23:15.974
each one of us becomes physically well.
We don't come to Mother and sit at

00:23:15.974 --> 00:23:22.289
Her feet and say, "Mother, please fix
my arthritis, please fix this, fix that,

00:23:22.289 --> 00:23:26.917
my mental problems, as I suggest,
perhaps some of you do.

00:23:26.996 --> 00:23:34.886
We are just so grateful that we have got
it. We know the technique because
She is able to teach us,

00:23:34.886 --> 00:23:38.788
because unconsciously we begin to
become aware of that technique

00:23:38.882 --> 00:23:43.102
and we know how to become our own
doctors and to cure ourselves

00:23:43.102 --> 00:23:48.690
because what happens after Self-
realization is that you become
your own doctor, your own guru,

00:23:48.690 --> 00:23:52.423
you become your own master.
You become fully in-control.

00:23:54.729 --> 00:24:00.699
This is the blessing of this Incarnation,
that we have before us.

00:24:01.175 --> 00:24:08.275
I challenge you ladies and gentleman to
allow your egos, to allow your rational
mind to be quiet a little longer,

00:24:08.275 --> 00:24:14.256
in this series of lectures and just to be
open to these Divine vibrations.

00:24:14.311 --> 00:24:19.781
Just be open to the Brahmshakti, to
allow the connection to establish itself

00:24:19.781 --> 00:24:29.282
firmly, so that the down-flowing of the
Grace can bathe your chakras, can
restore your physical body,

00:24:29.332 --> 00:24:35.932
can give you peace of mind, can give
you that 'Sat-chit-anand'. Jai Shri Mataji!
