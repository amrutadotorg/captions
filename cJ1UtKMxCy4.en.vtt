00:00:07.547 --> 00:00:11.172
When the Kundalini is rising,

00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:14.381
she rises spontaneously

00:00:14.737 --> 00:00:19.321
and passes through these six centers.

00:00:20.322 --> 00:00:24.364
That time she also at Vishuddhi,

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:31.271
she opens the Vishuddhi

00:00:33.222 --> 00:00:37.431
and when she emerges through it at that time

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.763
the tongue is a little bit pulled in

00:00:41.722 --> 00:00:43.930
just to keep the flow on.

00:00:44.222 --> 00:00:47.472
This reaction is called as khechari.

00:00:47.805 --> 00:00:53.555
So when people are very deeply in meditation,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.597
those who have achieved great heights in meditation,

00:00:59.597 --> 00:01:05.181
they find suddenly they get into khechari situation,

00:01:05.597 --> 00:01:09.805
or we call as mudra, in that state

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.889
as if some nectar starts flowing from your palate.

00:01:20.305 --> 00:01:24.470
If you move your tongue upward like that

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:29.637
you'll feel the cool coming down your tongue,

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:32.097
try that.

00:01:40.222 --> 00:01:42.471
Now this, you don't have to do

00:01:42.638 --> 00:01:46.055
when you are in deep meditative state.

00:01:46.264 --> 00:01:48.805
It starts cooling down your tongue slowly

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:53.680
as automatically you get into khechari state.

00:01:54.555 --> 00:01:57.306
As far as Sahaja yogis are concerned today,

00:01:57.513 --> 00:02:00.431
there are very few who really feel that way.

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.471
The reason is you do not meditate.

00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:08.181
We do not pay attention to our realization, also.

00:02:08.431 --> 00:02:10.972
We talk about it quite a lot, in the West specially

00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:14.972
we discuss it more than to do something about it.

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:19.930
We have to meditate every day,

00:02:20.222 --> 00:02:24.097
just like washing our hands

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:26.680
or just like cleaning our teeth,

00:02:26.972 --> 00:02:29.222
we have to in the morning-time meditate

00:02:29.471 --> 00:02:32.306
and also in the evening we have to meditate.

00:02:32.513 --> 00:02:34.722
We have to meditate both the times

00:02:34.972 --> 00:02:37.847
otherwise we cannot rise, we cannot grow.

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:40.347
Just to think that "We are realized souls"

00:02:40.555 --> 00:02:41.888
you do not become.

00:02:42.139 --> 00:02:45.513
This cleansing has to be done every day,

00:02:45.722 --> 00:02:48.306
every day in an hour.

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:53.014
And this is why none of the experiences which are described

00:02:53.264 --> 00:02:56.139
are felt sometimes in Sahaja Yoga

00:02:56.347 --> 00:02:57.680
and people ask

00:02:57.801 --> 00:03:00.468
"Mother, how it is that we don't feel the khechari?"

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:03.472
Because your attention is not also

00:03:03.722 --> 00:03:05.889
there where it should have been.

00:03:06.264 --> 00:03:11.805
So one has to try to meditate in such a manner

00:03:12.014 --> 00:03:16.638
that it is working of the Kundalini is facilitated.

00:03:17.847 --> 00:03:20.680
The chakras are cleansed out

00:03:20.972 --> 00:03:25.889
and ultimately you are in a state of meditation.

00:03:26.722 --> 00:03:30.930
It's not a question of how to go into meditation,

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:37.972
but is the question

00:03:39.555 --> 00:03:43.680
how to be in meditation all the time.

00:03:45.055 --> 00:03:48.222
So as you know that Kundalini, when she reaches

00:03:49.222 --> 00:03:51.222
the Agnya Chakra

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:54.097
and when She opens Agnya chakra,

00:03:55.597 --> 00:03:59.889
then you can be in thoughtless awareness,

00:04:00.555 --> 00:04:03.680
then you don't think - thinking just stops.

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.763
You watch everything, just watch,

00:04:09.471 --> 00:04:12.264
but you do not get involved into what you are watching,

00:04:12.471 --> 00:04:18.139
but you just watch and that watching itself

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.431
gives you the growth within.

00:04:22.972 --> 00:04:27.597
Think of the tree which is, say, in a turmoil or

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:31.805
during earthquake: it won't grow.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.222
When the earthquake stops,

00:04:35.431 --> 00:04:37.722
everything becomes quiet,

00:04:37.972 --> 00:04:39.472
everything is peaceful,

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.471
then only the tree can grow.

00:04:41.638 --> 00:04:44.638
In the same way, our growth can only take place

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.513
if we are peaceful within ourselves.
