1
00:39:20,158 --> 00:39:24,949
I would like to have some questions from you
about it.

2
00:39:24,939 --> 00:39:28,179
And then we’ll see how it works out.

3
00:39:28,179 --> 00:39:29,719
All right?

4
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:34,788
And not to be afraid, there’s nothing to
have any fear about kundalini.

5
00:39:34,788 --> 00:39:38,538
Because you must have read such big, big books
saying that kundalini burns you, kundalini

6
00:39:38,538 --> 00:39:39,538
does this.

7
00:39:39,538 --> 00:39:41,108
No she is your own mother.

8
00:39:41,108 --> 00:39:42,348
She doesn’t do anything of the kind.

9
00:39:42,348 --> 00:39:45,319
These are the people who have never known
what kundalini is.

10
00:39:45,319 --> 00:39:54,999
It’s like somebody putting the fingers into
the plug and saying electricity burns you.

11
00:39:54,999 --> 00:40:04,619
They are unauthorized people who have done
all this, and that’s how they have suffered.

12
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:09,708
So any questions please?

13
00:40:09,708 --> 00:40:19,048
Can’t think; if the kundalini rises above
this you become thoughtless just can’t think.

14
00:40:19,048 --> 00:40:22,539
And when she gets out from here you start
feeling the cool breeze from your head.

15
00:40:22,539 --> 00:40:25,578
Really a cool breeze you feel it and from
your fingers.

16
00:40:25,652 --> 00:40:27,518
As simple as that

17
00:40:27,569 --> 00:40:29,828
You are still doubting something.

18
00:40:29,868 --> 00:40:31,238
Ask a question.

19
00:40:32,658 --> 00:40:34,105
Can’t hear.

20
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,398
Loudly.

21
00:40:37,658 --> 00:40:39,515
Come, come, come here.

22
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:40,818
Come

23
00:40:45,258 --> 00:40:47,729
(Lady inaudible)

24
00:40:58,576 --> 00:41:03,783
All right All right May God bless you sit.

25
00:41:03,796 --> 00:41:07,083
She is saying that have you to pray to kundalini?

26
00:41:07,149 --> 00:41:10,620
No nothing you don’t have to.

27
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:19,119
You see prayer before realization has no meaning
it’s like telephoning without connection.

28
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:27,009
There’s nothing to pray nothing to pray
nothing to pray.

29
00:41:27,009 --> 00:41:36,300
(Lady inaudible) Can you come here?

30
00:41:36,300 --> 00:42:05,540
(Man: I think everybody has got a question
to ask but they don’t know how to ask you)

31
00:42:05,540 --> 00:42:09,140
They don’t want to?

32
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:11,840
What, What Questions?

33
00:42:11,840 --> 00:42:16,350
Ask now What is there?

34
00:42:16,350 --> 00:42:17,430
What is you don’t know?

35
00:42:17,430 --> 00:42:21,280
I know English at least so ask me any question
in English.

36
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:24,480
Now what did you say?

37
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:25,480
(Lady)

38
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:27,670
Oh very good question.

39
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:30,230
That’s a good question.

40
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:32,780
That’s a good one.

41
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:37,260
Yes sit down sit down sit down.

42
00:42:37,260 --> 00:42:43,320
She asked me a question if it is awakened
can it die out?

43
00:42:43,320 --> 00:42:44,360
It doesn’t.

44
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:49,150
Once it is awakened it goes up it opens out.

45
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:51,190
But, but is there.

46
00:42:51,190 --> 00:42:58,662
At the first shot you see it goes really in
a big way you get it in a really big way.

47
00:42:58,662 --> 00:42:59,662
You remember.

48
00:42:59,662 --> 00:43:06,810
But then it goes back and looks after other
parts where there’s a problem so the force

49
00:43:06,810 --> 00:43:07,860
is reduced.

50
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:17,520
But then you have to learn how to keep the
force there and how to raise it and this is

51
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,740
called as vidya, called as the knowledge.

52
00:43:20,740 --> 00:43:22,930
How to raise the kundalini….

53
00:43:22,930 --> 00:43:29,440
Side B: ….What is all this about?

54
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,340
So that part you have to know.

55
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:35,000
I am here to decode it.

56
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:39,720
Somebody come and told me, Mother I feel here
tickling, all the time tickling, I said this

57
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:43,189
centre is not all right you have to open this
centre.

58
00:43:43,189 --> 00:43:48,170
Now how to open this centre then I had to
tell that person you have to do this very

59
00:43:48,170 --> 00:43:49,170
simple method.

60
00:43:49,170 --> 00:43:52,920
You see certain movements, because it is flowing
from your hands, certain movements how to

61
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:56,600
do it, which are the deities on different
centers if you come to know about it.

62
00:43:56,600 --> 00:44:00,470
For example this centre is the centre of Christ.

63
00:44:00,470 --> 00:44:05,910
Between the optic chiasm is placed a very
subtle centre of Christ.

64
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:09,730
In the Indian scriptures He is called as Maha
Vishnu.

65
00:44:09,730 --> 00:44:14,899
Now He was born on this earth to suck the
ego and superego.

66
00:44:14,899 --> 00:44:21,429
His crucifixion was there to suck our sins
means the ego and the superego.

67
00:44:21,429 --> 00:44:22,990
But He is to be awakened.

68
00:44:22,990 --> 00:44:29,730
Unless and until He’s awakened it cannot
happen you go to church or you pray to Him

69
00:44:29,730 --> 00:44:30,730
nothing will happen.

70
00:44:30,730 --> 00:44:35,980
But if kundalini goes and stops there, and
if you say Lord’s Prayer, it will rise.

71
00:44:35,980 --> 00:44:40,390
Is the proof that it is Christ’s centre.

72
00:44:40,390 --> 00:44:47,619
Now this very important point that He should
be awakened that Christ was for this was never

73
00:44:47,619 --> 00:44:49,769
known to Christians.

74
00:44:49,769 --> 00:44:52,190
It’s a living process.

75
00:44:52,190 --> 00:44:54,700
He said I’m a living God.

76
00:44:54,700 --> 00:45:02,010
And when they went to India the way they talked
about Christianity was something absurd.

77
00:45:02,010 --> 00:45:06,399
So Hindus still believe that this one who
has to redeem us has to come.

78
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:11,100
They don’t know that He’s already born
and crucified and He’s the one.

79
00:45:11,100 --> 00:45:15,820
He is Maha Vishnu who is described in Devi
Mahatmyam very, very clearly.

80
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,339
He was specially made.

81
00:45:18,339 --> 00:45:22,790
Who was His father; who was His mother all
described.

82
00:45:22,790 --> 00:45:28,869
But the people who know English have no repor
with our ancient scriptures and those who

83
00:45:28,869 --> 00:45:35,029
went from here have no repor with Christ.

84
00:45:35,029 --> 00:45:37,050
That He’s to be awakened within us.

85
00:45:37,050 --> 00:45:39,529
He said I am to be born.

86
00:45:39,529 --> 00:45:45,959
And how to awaken it nobody knew only through
kundalini you can do it.

87
00:45:45,959 --> 00:45:51,190
He said, it’s said in the bible I’ll appear
before you like tongues of flames.

88
00:45:51,190 --> 00:45:53,149
Now what are these tongues of flames?

89
00:45:53,149 --> 00:45:58,139
Go and ask these people.

90
00:45:58,139 --> 00:46:01,510
These Jews do they know?

91
00:46:01,510 --> 00:46:09,200
Mohammed has very clearly said that you are
to become a peer; you have to be born again.

92
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:17,579
I mean namas is one of the very good ways
of raising the kundalini, if you are using

93
00:46:17,579 --> 00:46:19,600
the Sahaja Yoga method.

94
00:46:19,600 --> 00:46:22,520
Means you get your realization and then you
do namas.

95
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:24,430
You’ll be amazed.

96
00:46:24,430 --> 00:46:28,510
Everything has a meaning only when it is a
living thing.

97
00:46:28,510 --> 00:46:29,919
Otherwise it’s dummy.

98
00:46:29,919 --> 00:46:32,470
Everything is a dummy stuff you see like this
is a dummy thing.

99
00:46:32,470 --> 00:46:36,989
I shout at it or do whatever you like its
not going to work.

100
00:46:36,989 --> 00:46:44,220
That’s why everything is a dummy and that’s
why people say oh Christianity is wrong.

101
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:48,079
If you go to the Muslims they will say the
Jews are wrong.

102
00:46:48,079 --> 00:46:51,180
The Jews will say the Muslims are wrong, the
Hindus are wrong.

103
00:46:51,180 --> 00:46:52,580
I mean they are all blaming each other.

104
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:56,890
If you have to learn about yourself better
go to the other party.

105
00:46:56,890 --> 00:47:01,470
But they are all dummies.

106
00:47:01,470 --> 00:47:06,579
Once you get realized you will know they are
all connected with each other absolutely one

107
00:47:06,579 --> 00:47:09,260
there’s complete harmony and concord.

108
00:47:09,260 --> 00:47:13,019
Christ Himself has said those who are not
against Me are with Me.

109
00:47:13,019 --> 00:47:19,380
Now go and ask these priests who are those
who are not against Him; who are with Him.

110
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:26,829
I mean, He was not even given sufficient time
only for four years He could talk and He was

111
00:47:26,829 --> 00:47:27,829
killed.

112
00:47:27,829 --> 00:47:32,889
Everywhere they have done a nice pickling
up of all these great people.

113
00:47:32,889 --> 00:47:45,660
But Sahaja Yoga completely exposes their advents,
their purpose, their places within us and

114
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:51,740
also establishes all the fundamental things
that are described in all the scriptures and

115
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:53,709
their core relationships.

116
00:47:53,709 --> 00:47:58,040
It’s such a fantastic thing.

117
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,230
How it establishes?

118
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,320
By proving it.

119
00:48:01,320 --> 00:48:04,400
I’ll tell you one example, a simple example.

120
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:07,901
There was a gentleman from Iran he was a doctor
he came to see me.

121
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:11,960
I mean it is now we cannot contact him because
he’s in Iran.

122
00:48:11,960 --> 00:48:14,620
But he came to see me he was a Muslim.

123
00:48:14,620 --> 00:48:20,140
And I told him that Mohammed Sahib was born
as Nanak Sahib in India.

124
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,140
He could not believe it.

125
00:48:21,140 --> 00:48:22,140
He said how can it be?

126
00:48:22,140 --> 00:48:27,500
Though Nanak Sahib had said it in a way, because
Nanak Sahib was sleeping and somebody told

127
00:48:27,500 --> 00:48:31,760
Him that you are placing your feet towards
Mecca he said all right I’ll turn my feet

128
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,880
to other side and the Mecca came that side.

129
00:48:36,880 --> 00:48:39,930
He said I can’t believe it’ I can’t
believe it.

130
00:48:39,930 --> 00:48:42,400
I said but Mohammed Sahib Has said that He
is the last.

131
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:48,310
I said I’m not sure of that but maybe He
must have decided to come back the way people

132
00:48:48,310 --> 00:48:49,310
are.

133
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:50,310
He could not believe it.

134
00:48:50,310 --> 00:48:58,870
And he had stomach cancer, which is caused
by one of the reasons is fanaticism.

135
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:01,090
I told him you have to believe in Him.

136
00:49:01,090 --> 00:49:07,240
He was one of the incarnations of the Primordial
Master and He was the same Abraham was the

137
00:49:07,240 --> 00:49:10,260
same Moses was the same Socrates was the same.

138
00:49:10,260 --> 00:49:11,570
And you have to believe it.

139
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:12,890
He said I can’t believe it.

140
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:14,210
I said I can’t cure you.

141
00:49:14,210 --> 00:49:16,180
Then he went back and he was very sick.

142
00:49:16,180 --> 00:49:20,690
His wife said now what is there after all,
you see, we became Muslims because our parents

143
00:49:20,690 --> 00:49:23,180
were Muslims and they told us Mohammed Sahib
was the last.

144
00:49:23,180 --> 00:49:24,900
After all you are to be saved.

145
00:49:24,900 --> 00:49:30,650
Then he came and said all right Mother whatever
you say I’m going to say.

146
00:49:30,650 --> 00:49:33,890
I said now you pray to Nanak Sahib instead
of Mohammed Sahib because it is Mohammed Sahib

147
00:49:33,890 --> 00:49:36,380
who’s angry with you.

148
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:40,120
He got cured; he’s still living.

149
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:41,120
He got cured.

150
00:49:41,120 --> 00:49:42,120
It’s so simple.

151
00:49:42,120 --> 00:49:43,120
We can’t believe it; it is so fantastic.

152
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:46,010
It is worth seeing yourself with your own
eyes.

153
00:49:46,010 --> 00:49:52,420
The other day only, in Scotland, there was
a Gentleman was suffering from terrible, terrible

154
00:49:52,420 --> 00:49:53,420
arthritis.

155
00:49:53,420 --> 00:49:58,060
He got completely cured and he came to see
me in Edinburgh.

156
00:49:58,060 --> 00:50:04,870
Arthritis absolutely curable; Diabetes is
absolutely curable; paralysis is absolutely

157
00:50:04,870 --> 00:50:05,870
curable.

158
00:50:05,870 --> 00:50:08,620
These all come out of your imbalances.

159
00:50:08,620 --> 00:50:15,500
If you want to treat a tree and if you just
treat a flower or a leaf you cannot treat

160
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:16,500
the tree.

161
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:18,110
You have to go through the sap.

162
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:23,120
Sahaja Yoga is a system by which you go through
the sap of a personality and treat the whole

163
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:24,360
body as a whole.

164
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:31,281
Because the whole is the one, which is to
be looked after and not a part of it, because

165
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:33,940
you are a part of the whole.

166
00:50:33,940 --> 00:50:39,440
And once you get connected with the whole
that whole that primordial being looks after

167
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:40,870
you.

168
00:50:40,870 --> 00:50:46,180
And this is what has exactly happened to us
that we are all separated from the whole and

169
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:51,230
we have to become one with that with all our
awareness and understanding; so that that

170
00:50:51,230 --> 00:50:55,430
whole looks after us.

171
00:50:55,430 --> 00:51:01,780
So coming back to your question about kundalini
that it falls off is a true thing with some

172
00:51:01,780 --> 00:51:03,540
people it does go down.

173
00:51:03,540 --> 00:51:06,650
But all the forces that are divine are looking
after you.

174
00:51:06,650 --> 00:51:13,290
You have to little bit cooperate with your
kundalini and she comes up she makes you beautiful,

175
00:51:13,290 --> 00:51:18,840
absolutely beautiful.

176
00:51:18,840 --> 00:51:20,100
Now any more questions?

177
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,700
Man: Could you explain what exactly you have
to do?

178
00:51:24,700 --> 00:51:26,870
That’s the exact point.

179
00:51:26,870 --> 00:51:28,330
You don’t have to do anything.

180
00:51:28,330 --> 00:51:32,120
You see I have to do something about it not
you.

181
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:34,970
In the beginning then you can do it.

182
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:36,650
Like this light is here all right?

183
00:51:36,650 --> 00:51:37,690
This is enlightened.

184
00:51:37,690 --> 00:51:43,040
Now there’s another candle, which is not
enlightened that candle has to sit straight

185
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:45,190
just keep the wick out that’s all.

186
00:51:45,190 --> 00:51:51,040
And this candle has to just go near that and
that gets enlightened.

187
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:54,211
I mean, I’m not doing anything about it
that also I must say because sometimes the

188
00:51:54,211 --> 00:51:56,360
ego gets challenged; you know somebody says,
why Mother you?

189
00:51:56,360 --> 00:51:57,900
I said you better do it.

190
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:03,780
I’ll be very happy to be replaced.

191
00:52:03,780 --> 00:52:07,651
If you can come and do it, nothing like it.

192
00:52:07,651 --> 00:52:08,651
You see it’ll be such a change.

193
00:52:08,651 --> 00:52:09,651
But what can I do?

194
00:52:09,651 --> 00:52:12,900
I have to do it.

195
00:52:12,900 --> 00:52:19,270
Otherwise I’m a happily married woman; I
have my children, grandchildren, everyone

196
00:52:19,270 --> 00:52:21,800
there, I have no problems.

197
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:28,000
But I see your problems, and I see that spirit
in you, and I just feel in all my love and

198
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,100
compassion that you must know it; that’s
all.

199
00:52:32,100 --> 00:52:35,500
And once you know it you can do it yourself.

200
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,170
Like one light can enlighten many.

201
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:38,170
Isn’t it?

202
00:52:38,170 --> 00:52:39,270
It’s as simple.

203
00:52:39,270 --> 00:52:40,530
You become that.

204
00:52:40,530 --> 00:52:43,070
You don’t have to do anything about it;
you have to just put your fingers like this

205
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:44,960
and the power flows into you.

206
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,030
It’s that simple.

207
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:50,090
You won’t believe but it is so because you
are ready.

208
00:52:50,090 --> 00:52:52,750
You are just ready to be enlightened.

209
00:52:52,750 --> 00:52:57,850
Now this instrument is made, if it is not
put to the mains what’s the use?

210
00:52:57,850 --> 00:52:58,850
But how do you put to the mains?

211
00:52:58,850 --> 00:53:01,120
Just put to the mains, that’s all.

212
00:53:01,120 --> 00:53:03,690
The mains are there and this is ready you
just put to the mains.

213
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:04,690
You are just there.

214
00:53:04,690 --> 00:53:10,690
Like a television set to a villager if you
tell, he won’t believe that it is so fantastic.

215
00:53:10,690 --> 00:53:13,430
That there are all things around you; he will
say I can’t see anything.

216
00:53:13,430 --> 00:53:14,490
How can he believe it?

217
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:18,520
When you put to the mains and you start seeing
the television manifesting, which is so fantastic.

218
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,870
In the same way, you are a special instrument
created by God.

219
00:53:21,870 --> 00:53:25,490
You are just put to the mains.

220
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:27,050
You don’t have to do anything.

221
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:28,770
What did you do for your evolution?

222
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:33,520
When we became human beings from a monkey
what did we do?

223
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,830
Nothing, we did not cut our tail or anything
it just dropped off.

224
00:53:39,830 --> 00:53:42,880
In the same way, we don’t do anything for
this also; it’s just there; you are just

225
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:45,000
ready; you just get it like that.

226
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:46,540
You don’t know how fantastic you are.

227
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:47,570
You don’t know that, na?

228
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:48,700
I know that.

229
00:53:48,700 --> 00:53:50,210
But you will also know very soon.

230
00:53:50,210 --> 00:53:54,130
When you know you will be amazed how fantastic
you are within.

231
00:53:54,130 --> 00:53:58,590
It’s said all ways, all the scriptures,
all the great people have described you as

232
00:53:58,590 --> 00:53:59,590
very great.

233
00:53:59,590 --> 00:54:02,000
All of them have described.

234
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:05,390
But you must have faith in yourself that you
are great, no doubt.

235
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:08,650
And that instrument is ready, just ready.

236
00:54:08,650 --> 00:54:11,520
It is to be applied to the mains and once
you start manifesting you can give it to others.

237
00:54:11,520 --> 00:54:12,980
It’s that simple.

238
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:18,190
You can’t believe it I know, but it is so,
you will see that very soon.

239
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:20,080
Do not doubt it too much all right?

240
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:22,390
Otherwise this brain will be working khat
khat khat.

241
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:30,010
That’s why I’ve said for a while you should
stop thinking about it then it will work out.

242
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:33,900
Because I’ve seen people who go on doubting
very much they take time.

243
00:54:33,900 --> 00:54:42,390
Just open, open out yourself, you must open
yourself fully and it will work out.

244
00:54:42,390 --> 00:54:45,620
After all you want to have your realization
isn’t it?

245
00:54:45,620 --> 00:54:47,240
What else you want?

246
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,790
You don’t want to doubt for doubting sake.

247
00:54:49,790 --> 00:54:51,950
What’s the use of doubting also?

248
00:54:51,950 --> 00:54:54,800
I mean if there is supposing I say there’s
a diamond here.

249
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:59,640
You will all run not only you but people from
Australia will come if I say it is free available.

250
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,210
Don’t you think so?

251
00:55:01,210 --> 00:55:07,830
They will say worth going by plane, if there’s
such a big diamond available.

252
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:08,900
So no use doubting.

253
00:55:08,900 --> 00:55:09,900
Just have it.

254
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,200
You have a diamond in your heart.

255
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:16,110
No doubt it will spark.

256
00:55:16,110 --> 00:55:17,320
Do not doubt.

257
00:55:17,320 --> 00:55:20,790
This mind has been doubting all the time,
what has it given you?

258
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:25,600
Nothing it will give you problems and headaches.

259
00:55:25,600 --> 00:55:33,920
Don’t be doubting Thomas’s; be trusting.

260
00:55:33,920 --> 00:55:39,540
Come here; come.

261
00:55:39,540 --> 00:55:49,970
Lady: do you find people’s problems stop
them getting realization?

262
00:55:49,970 --> 00:55:55,000
Problems it stops a little sometimes little
bit.

263
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:58,990
But I know all the permutations, combinations
now.

264
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:02,630
So I can get over all the problems; I think
so.

265
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:04,310
All right?

266
00:56:04,310 --> 00:56:07,050
I know many permutations and combinations
now of problems.

267
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:13,450
In the beginning you’ll be amazed in this
England I came here when my husband got elected

268
00:56:13,450 --> 00:56:14,590
to this job.

269
00:56:14,590 --> 00:56:21,150
For four years I worked on six people, for
four years, can you imagine?

270
00:56:21,150 --> 00:56:23,540
And now they just get it like that.

271
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:27,830
Now I know all the permutations, combinations
of English people and England and western

272
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:28,830
people.

273
00:56:28,830 --> 00:56:33,749
Now I’m going to America and I’ve been
there before also; so keep your fingers crossed;

274
00:56:33,749 --> 00:56:37,870
I’m sure I’ll work it out there also.

275
00:56:37,870 --> 00:56:41,230
Everybody’s an interesting sample of some
combination.

276
00:56:41,230 --> 00:56:46,210
But I know all the keys somehow; I’ve studied
it and I’ve put all attention to it.

277
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:51,270
It has worked out and all these problems I
know what you all have.

278
00:56:51,270 --> 00:56:54,370
Somehow it works out so don’t you worry
about that.

279
00:56:54,370 --> 00:56:57,950
If there were no problems, there was no need
to do this.

280
00:56:57,950 --> 00:57:00,159
I mean you would be just there.

281
00:57:00,159 --> 00:57:04,070
There has to be problems.

282
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:10,070
Any other problem?

283
00:57:10,070 --> 00:57:20,320
Man: We’ve got seven chakras over there;
can you please tell us what part each one

284
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:21,320
plays?

285
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:22,320
That’s good.

286
00:57:22,320 --> 00:57:25,820
Now all that is so elaborate I may not be
able to tell you today; but can you come and

287
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:26,820
show?

288
00:57:26,820 --> 00:57:29,180
But I will be able to say in short, all right?

289
00:57:29,180 --> 00:57:33,919
Now he is coming; he will show you.

290
00:57:33,919 --> 00:57:46,320
Now the first chakra which is below the kundalini
the first one is the very important centre,

291
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:55,270
which is bestowed by a deity, which is the
embodiment of innocence.

292
00:57:55,270 --> 00:58:00,210
Is the centre of innocence, the first chakra.

293
00:58:00,210 --> 00:58:06,629
To explain it more we can say when we were
at the carbon stage, carbon stage.

294
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:10,610
Now Carbon is a very important element, you
know that.

295
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:16,900
In the periodical laws it is placed in the
centre; it is tetravalent means it has four

296
00:58:16,900 --> 00:58:20,010
hands either it can give four hands or take
four hands.

297
00:58:20,010 --> 00:58:25,659
And at that stage only the nature started
producing life.

298
00:58:25,659 --> 00:58:28,980
So that is the stage where we were at carbon
level.

299
00:58:28,980 --> 00:58:34,220
And nature is innocent a chair doesn’t get
angry with you.

300
00:58:34,220 --> 00:58:37,380
Its only we can get angry.

301
00:58:37,380 --> 00:58:43,509
So the nature that we are, is innocent our
basis is innocence.

302
00:58:43,509 --> 00:58:45,889
We are surrounded first by innocence.

303
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,630
We are basically innocent people.

304
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:51,560
So this is the first centre, is of innocence.

305
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,739
Then the second centre that you see.

306
00:58:54,739 --> 00:58:56,680
Actually the Nabhi we can take it.

307
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,379
Is the second centre and the third centre
are connected.

308
00:59:00,379 --> 00:59:04,960
From the second centre arises the third centre.

309
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:13,769
The second centre is the centre of our seeking.

310
00:59:13,769 --> 00:59:16,980
This one manifests our solar plexus.

311
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:21,570
And this caters to our seeking.

312
00:59:21,570 --> 00:59:28,129
As amoeba we were seeking our food through
our stomach; it is in the stomach we can say.

313
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:32,190
Actually they are all placed in the medulla
oblongata; they are placed in the spinal chord.

314
00:59:32,190 --> 00:59:34,860
But they manifest outside the plexuses.

315
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:43,659
For example, the first one manifests the plexus
called as pelvic plexus, which is responsible

316
00:59:43,659 --> 00:59:45,680
for our excretory functions.

317
00:59:45,680 --> 00:59:46,710
All right?

318
00:59:46,710 --> 00:59:52,609
Now the second one, which is the one I told
you just now, manifests the solar plexus,

319
00:59:52,609 --> 00:59:54,350
is for our seeking.

320
00:59:54,350 --> 01:00:00,529
And now you are at a stage where you are seeking
the ultimate the beyond.

321
01:00:00,529 --> 01:00:04,820
But there are people who are still seeking
money, there are people who are still seeking

322
01:00:04,820 --> 01:00:06,580
other things.

323
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:12,180
But I take if for granted that you are seeking
divine.

324
01:00:12,180 --> 01:00:15,889
So the seeking reaches that state at that
centre.

325
01:00:15,889 --> 01:00:20,669
The other centre that comes out of it is the
centre of action.

326
01:00:20,669 --> 01:00:23,800
The seeking has to put into action.

327
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:27,159
Otherwise supposing you are hungry you have
to go into action to get it.

328
01:00:27,159 --> 01:00:34,149
So this is the centre of action within us,
which works within us all the activities for

329
01:00:34,149 --> 01:00:35,149
the future.

330
01:00:35,149 --> 01:00:46,359
It thinks and all the activities that we require
for our mental or our physical needs.

331
01:00:46,359 --> 01:00:49,430
So this is a center of the creator.

332
01:00:49,430 --> 01:00:57,639
The above centre to that is the centre which
is the centre of Heart as we call it.

333
01:00:57,639 --> 01:01:02,490
Is the centre which represents your sense
of security.

334
01:01:02,490 --> 01:01:10,580
When the child is about twelve years of age
this centre creates anti bodies in your sternum

335
01:01:10,580 --> 01:01:16,100
bone and these antibodies by the time the
child is about twelve years of age go into

336
01:01:16,100 --> 01:01:23,630
the whole body and they are the ones who react
to any invasion on the body.

337
01:01:23,630 --> 01:01:31,039
And these antibodies react; say for example,
all our injection system works on that.

338
01:01:31,039 --> 01:01:38,129
We put a little virus, which is an outsider
invader inside the body and when you put that

339
01:01:38,129 --> 01:01:40,380
they get energetic to fight.

340
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:44,289
And because of their energies they fight the
disease and we get cured.

341
01:01:44,289 --> 01:01:46,619
This is the principle of that is.

342
01:01:46,619 --> 01:01:49,680
This is the center of our sense of security.

343
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:56,529
When we are insecure then this centre starts
pulsating and emitting more antibodies and

344
01:01:56,529 --> 01:01:57,529
looking after us.

345
01:01:57,529 --> 01:01:59,789
And this is a very important centre within
us.

346
01:01:59,789 --> 01:02:04,550
But there are other two other centers on sides
of it; one is of the mother, one of the father;

347
01:02:04,550 --> 01:02:05,550
on both sides.

348
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:07,870
I mean they have sub centers also.

349
01:02:07,870 --> 01:02:11,749
Now this one can be called as the one which
manifests cardiac plexus.

350
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:19,050
Then above that is the centre which is behind
here, is the centre of our collectivity.

351
01:02:19,050 --> 01:02:22,759
Is the centre where we become one with the
whole.

352
01:02:22,759 --> 01:02:26,100
Is the centre which gives us the idea that
we are one.

353
01:02:26,100 --> 01:02:31,970
By this centre we become also the witness
of the play of the divine later on when it

354
01:02:31,970 --> 01:02:32,970
is enlightened.

355
01:02:32,970 --> 01:02:37,970
It is a very important centre by which we
talk to others, we communicate to others on

356
01:02:37,970 --> 01:02:39,239
the right hand side.

357
01:02:39,239 --> 01:02:45,550
On the left hand side emotionally we become
attached to people.

358
01:02:45,550 --> 01:02:52,090
Then above that is the centre as I told you
of Christ or we can say the centre of ascent.

359
01:02:52,090 --> 01:03:00,129
There is the door, which goes into this area
of limbic area, which is grossly known as

360
01:03:00,129 --> 01:03:02,279
limbic area, which is the kingdom of God.

361
01:03:02,279 --> 01:03:06,840
And above is the last one here where this
point.

362
01:03:06,840 --> 01:03:10,220
The whole thing is one centre the limbic area
and this point.

363
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:15,050
When the ego and superego are sucked in, the
kundalini rushes through, and this fontanel

364
01:03:15,050 --> 01:03:20,489
bone area becomes very soft and you start
getting the cool breeze from that part.

365
01:03:20,489 --> 01:03:24,940
Now in short I’ve told you but in details
you can go through the book it’s all written

366
01:03:24,940 --> 01:03:26,349
down about these centers.

367
01:03:26,349 --> 01:03:32,349
Which are the basic seven centers but there
are many other centers, which are sub plexuses

368
01:03:32,349 --> 01:03:33,560
of this.

369
01:03:33,560 --> 01:03:38,950
Amazingly there’s one thing that all these
centers are manifesting the plexuses outside

370
01:03:38,950 --> 01:03:40,919
and all these plexuses.

371
01:03:40,919 --> 01:03:46,629
For example here, the plexus is the one that
looks after the pituitary and the pineal,

372
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:48,250
these two things.

373
01:03:48,250 --> 01:03:55,099
So it is related absolutely with the gross
as well but we go from inside outward while

374
01:03:55,099 --> 01:03:57,000
the doctors go from outward inside.

375
01:03:57,000 --> 01:04:01,190
Which you cannot go you cannot enter into
a tree through a leaf you can enter only through

376
01:04:01,190 --> 01:04:03,050
the sap into it.

377
01:04:03,050 --> 01:04:05,409
These are in short I have told you.

378
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:09,081
But there are all these things are clearly
written down in a book that they will give

379
01:04:09,081 --> 01:04:10,081
you.

380
01:04:10,081 --> 01:04:11,081
They have got it.

381
01:04:11,081 --> 01:04:12,081
Have you got that book?

382
01:04:12,081 --> 01:04:13,081
You can get.

383
01:04:13,081 --> 01:04:14,081
It’s a very small booklet.

384
01:04:14,081 --> 01:04:15,240
Do you charge any money for that?

385
01:04:15,240 --> 01:04:16,240
No?

386
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:17,240
It’s free?

387
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:18,240
You charge a little.

388
01:04:18,240 --> 01:04:19,240
How much?

389
01:04:19,240 --> 01:04:20,860
Man: Ten pie or something.

390
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:23,259
Ten pie or something they charge.

391
01:04:23,259 --> 01:04:29,399
You see because maybe, so far all these boys
have been printing it and paying for it for

392
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:30,399
the whole also.

393
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:34,140
I mean this thing requires money no doubt,
but these boys have been doing it.

394
01:04:34,140 --> 01:04:36,269
And it’s all right not much you see.

395
01:04:36,269 --> 01:04:42,749
Birmingham is a cheep place that way I must
say compared to some places I went to.

396
01:04:42,749 --> 01:04:48,980
Also everybody is trying to fund it so that,
I mean there is no sort of any profit basis

397
01:04:48,980 --> 01:04:49,980
or anything.

398
01:04:49,980 --> 01:04:55,180
But like ashram we have got we have got say
ten people they take a house they live there,

399
01:04:55,180 --> 01:04:57,480
look after it and that’s an ashram.

400
01:04:57,480 --> 01:05:02,500
There’s no sort of a profit making or any
fees or anything.

401
01:05:02,500 --> 01:05:04,899
Because they live there, they have a house,
they live there that’s all.

402
01:05:04,899 --> 01:05:05,919
It’s as simple as that.

403
01:05:05,919 --> 01:05:10,289
We do not have any such organization; there
is nobody who is organized in it.

404
01:05:10,289 --> 01:05:12,029
You cannot organize God.

405
01:05:12,029 --> 01:05:16,789
So there’s no organization they are there
because of their free will, because of their

406
01:05:16,789 --> 01:05:21,550
freedom and because of their love and because
they feel responsible that they should do

407
01:05:21,550 --> 01:05:22,550
it.

408
01:05:22,550 --> 01:05:27,909
There’s no force on you; there’s no compulsion;
there’s no money taking; there’s no membership.

409
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:42,928
Man: Is it also possible please for any of
those centers to awaken without the knowledge

410
01:05:42,928 --> 01:05:45,838
of the individual?

411
01:05:45,888 --> 01:05:55,119
You see, sometimes it happens, that a person
can be attacked from the sides and then that

412
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:57,549
centre can go on emitting too much.

413
01:05:57,549 --> 01:05:59,599
Like in cancer it happens.

414
01:05:59,599 --> 01:06:03,118
That one of the centers you see, say for instance
the stomach.

415
01:06:03,118 --> 01:06:10,248
If you are eating say something which is irritating
the stomach centre, then what happens that

416
01:06:10,248 --> 01:06:16,888
this centre receives all the energies from
everywhere, all the stored up energy and starts

417
01:06:16,888 --> 01:06:18,049
working very hard.

418
01:06:18,049 --> 01:06:21,368
When it starts working very hard, it gets
dislocated.

419
01:06:21,368 --> 01:06:26,399
When it gets dislocated, what happens that
there is no relationship left with the whole

420
01:06:26,399 --> 01:06:33,098
and the cells starts growing more than in
relation to the whole.

421
01:06:33,098 --> 01:06:35,689
And we say malignancy has been set in.

422
01:06:35,689 --> 01:06:38,828
And like that can happen they can get over
excited.

423
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:44,169
But the energy from other centers is brought
in one and they get over excited with out

424
01:06:44,169 --> 01:06:46,078
any relationship to the whole.

425
01:06:46,078 --> 01:06:47,828
And that’s a very dangerous situation.

426
01:06:47,828 --> 01:06:53,309
Such a thing can happen and sometimes it can
happen on certain centers where people just

427
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,309
get possessed.

428
01:06:54,309 --> 01:06:56,299
And they think they have got some sort of
a great experience.

429
01:06:56,299 --> 01:06:57,299
Is not so.

430
01:06:57,299 --> 01:07:01,519
Like there was a lady who always felt she’s
getting out of her body.

431
01:07:01,519 --> 01:07:02,998
Ultimately she got her cancer.

432
01:07:02,998 --> 01:07:05,329
Now, of course, she is cured; she’s all
right.

433
01:07:05,329 --> 01:07:10,008
But these all such experiences come from the
left and the right side.

434
01:07:10,008 --> 01:07:11,008
Not from the superior.

435
01:07:11,008 --> 01:07:16,179
The one experience on the left hand side is
of the collective subconscious because on

436
01:07:16,179 --> 01:07:21,208
the left hand side of this channel that you
see is the collective subconscious.

437
01:07:21,208 --> 01:07:26,089
Now we do not know because these are unknown
areas for us; the collective subconscious

438
01:07:26,089 --> 01:07:28,988
on this area and the collective supraconscious
on this area.

439
01:07:28,988 --> 01:07:32,659
Now, for example, spiritualists they work
from the collective subconscious; very dangerous

440
01:07:32,659 --> 01:07:34,008
thing to do.

441
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:37,128
We have nothing to do with spirits, nothing
to do with them.

442
01:07:37,128 --> 01:07:39,789
We are in the centre and the present.

443
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:45,138
If you indulge into spiritualism, you’ll
find you develop a very funny situation and

444
01:07:45,138 --> 01:07:47,118
I don’t know how they end it up.

445
01:07:47,118 --> 01:07:53,478
Apart from mental trouble, you’ll be amazed,
I’m amazed at it myself, that all the cancer

446
01:07:53,478 --> 01:07:58,963
patients I’ve seen so far are all attacked
from the left side not from the right side.

447
01:07:59,043 --> 01:08:03,043
Those who are attacked from the right side
is the supraconscious the collective supraconscious

448
01:08:03,043 --> 01:08:04,534
are the people like Hitler.

449
01:08:04,534 --> 01:08:12,343
Who get possessed by very, you can say very,
very dominating personalities who are dead

450
01:08:12,343 --> 01:08:15,943
or those who lived in the future great planners
this that they get attacked.

451
01:08:15,943 --> 01:08:20,784
And once they get attacked there’s an outlet.

452
01:08:20,784 --> 01:08:25,063
For example you can say Hitler was like a
medium and he transformed other people into

453
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:28,463
that kind of a frantic temperament.

454
01:08:28,463 --> 01:08:33,423
I mean it took him eleven years to build up
that kind of a domain of Satans you see but

455
01:08:33,423 --> 01:08:34,524
it took eleven years.

456
01:08:34,524 --> 01:08:39,894
And I would blame then the people who allowed
this to grow and once this grew up and suddenly

457
01:08:39,894 --> 01:08:43,644
it blew up them then they realized; oh God
where are we?

458
01:08:43,644 --> 01:08:48,904
So these attacks can come from these two areas
they are called as Adiboutic and Adidevic

459
01:08:48,904 --> 01:08:50,454
in Sanskrit language.

460
01:08:50,454 --> 01:08:57,303
But this is, is the spirit; is the Atma; is
the superior; is the super most experience

461
01:08:57,303 --> 01:09:03,463
where you become the spirit itself, your spirit
not somebody else’s.

462
01:09:03,463 --> 01:09:09,423
So all these experiences are not healthy;
they should be avoided for all those who are

463
01:09:09,423 --> 01:09:10,423
seeking reality.

464
01:09:10,423 --> 01:09:14,665
I mean if you want to have some jugglery,
then it’s a different thing but it is a

465
01:09:14,665 --> 01:09:16,813
very dangerous thing to play with it.

466
01:09:16,813 --> 01:09:20,413
All these gurus are using only this either
left or the right side.

467
01:09:20,413 --> 01:09:24,075
They use the spirits and that’s how they
mesmerize.

468
01:09:25,705 --> 01:09:27,805
That’s a very dangerous state.

469
01:09:27,870 --> 01:09:33,019
The other day Sahaja Yoga has become so powerful
now that they these people gave realization

470
01:09:33,059 --> 01:09:35,810
to an archbishop of black magic.

471
01:09:35,810 --> 01:09:36,810
Can you imagine?

472
01:09:36,810 --> 01:09:38,360
I was amazed.

473
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:43,150
And this fellow was quite all right then he
went home and he found everything was moving

474
01:09:43,150 --> 01:09:44,150
around.

475
01:09:44,150 --> 01:09:46,919
This all the things that were there were moving
around.

476
01:09:46,919 --> 01:09:51,760
Now the spirits were tempting him back they
thought if we show some sort of this jugglery

477
01:09:51,760 --> 01:09:53,399
he will be back again.

478
01:09:53,399 --> 01:09:55,490
And they telephoned to me Mother now what
to do.

479
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:56,789
I said why did you give him realization?

480
01:09:56,789 --> 01:09:58,819
There was no need to give him realization.

481
01:09:58,819 --> 01:10:00,730
He said just he came and he got it.

482
01:10:00,730 --> 01:10:02,539
I said leave him alone I’ll look after him
you don’t worry.

483
01:10:02,539 --> 01:10:05,809
It happens now.

484
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:10,769
This Sahaja yoga is so great imagine giving
realization to the archbishop of black magic.

485
01:10:10,769 --> 01:10:12,919
I mean this is too much.

486
01:10:12,919 --> 01:10:14,209
It’s doing.

487
01:10:22,009 --> 01:10:23,290
It’s happening.

488
01:10:23,480 --> 01:10:28,192
Man: May I say by the way that um I can see
a white aura around your head for the last

489
01:10:28,210 --> 01:10:29,210
hour.

490
01:10:29,256 --> 01:10:32,542
Yes it’s true, but I would say don’t see
that.

491
01:10:32,592 --> 01:10:36,181
You’ll see many things because I’m something
more; there’s no doubt.

492
01:10:36,181 --> 01:10:37,181
Quite a lot I am.

493
01:10:37,181 --> 01:10:39,962
That you have to discover later.

494
01:10:39,962 --> 01:10:41,451
You can see many things.

495
01:10:41,451 --> 01:10:46,681
But I would say don’t say anything because
this also seeing is not the thing experiencing

496
01:10:46,681 --> 01:10:51,321
is the thing and that’s why you must experience
your being.

497
01:10:51,321 --> 01:10:53,771
And People have seen me in many forms many
things.

498
01:10:53,771 --> 01:10:55,331
That’s not important.

499
01:10:55,331 --> 01:10:56,892
That’s not important.

500
01:10:56,892 --> 01:11:01,071
Important is that you must get your realization.

501
01:11:01,071 --> 01:11:03,821
I must be something isn’t it to do it?

502
01:11:03,821 --> 01:11:05,811
No doubt there must be something about me.

503
01:11:05,811 --> 01:11:07,951
But I don’t want to talk about it just now.

504
01:11:07,951 --> 01:11:11,352
I’m very tactful; you better find out.

505
01:11:11,352 --> 01:11:14,624
Lady: Why is peace and tranquility adjusted
on your face?

506
01:11:14,624 --> 01:11:21,311
On my face?

507
01:11:21,311 --> 01:11:22,561
You are also going to get it.

508
01:11:22,561 --> 01:11:24,321
That’s all I can say.

509
01:11:24,321 --> 01:11:26,911
It is there inside.

510
01:11:26,911 --> 01:11:31,291
It is all whatever is inside comes out isn’t
it?

511
01:11:31,291 --> 01:11:36,331
You are all peace, tranquility everything
inside you are also the same not only me.

512
01:11:36,331 --> 01:11:39,691
You have to just feel it.

513
01:11:39,691 --> 01:11:46,122
You will, you will no doubt, you will no doubt.

514
01:11:46,122 --> 01:11:47,122
I assure you.

515
01:11:47,122 --> 01:11:48,791
That’s why I’m here; I want you to enjoy
that what I am enjoying.

516
01:11:48,791 --> 01:11:49,872
That’s all.

517
01:11:49,872 --> 01:11:52,462
You see it’s like a drunkard who cannot
enjoy his drink.

518
01:11:52,462 --> 01:11:55,889
That’s why I say that I am a capitalist
because I have all these powers and I am the

519
01:11:55,921 --> 01:11:57,989
greatest communist because I must share.

520
01:11:58,049 --> 01:12:00,768
I can’t help it without sharing.

521
01:12:00,768 --> 01:12:06,258
So this such a combination, all right?
