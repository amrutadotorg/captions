WEBVTT

00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.130
Today we are going to worship Shri Krishna as Yogeshwara.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:23.925
As it is, you know that Vishnu’s first incarnation as a human being

00:00:24.674 --> 00:00:26.352
was Vamana avatar.

00:00:28.637 --> 00:00:37.502
And then went till He came as Shri Ram.

00:00:39.312 --> 00:00:45.459
So, the past of Shri Krishna was Shri Ram.

00:00:45.697 --> 00:00:48.297
And when Shri Rama came on this earth,

00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:54.308
He went into lots of austerities, to go to jungle,

00:00:54.546 --> 00:00:58.217
His wife was lost, whom He had to find out.

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:03.824
And to establish the benevolent king

00:01:05.273 --> 00:01:14.677
on this earth, He was made the king of Ayodhya.

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:29.102
But all His life it was a struggle
and austerities which He followed.

00:01:30.174 --> 00:01:33.241
As a result, the people who followed Shri Ram

00:01:33.428 --> 00:01:35.868
became extremely austere.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.416
They used to sleep on the grass

00:01:43.547 --> 00:01:47.680
because Shri Ram had to sleep on the grass for so many years.

00:01:48.676 --> 00:01:52.723
They used to wear wooden slippers.

00:01:53.934 --> 00:02:00.283
They would just wear very little clothes or one dhoti,

00:02:00.482 --> 00:02:04.727
just like Shri Rama wore when His wife was out.

00:02:05.403 --> 00:02:13.196
All these austerities they did to show how a householder should be.

00:02:14.784 --> 00:02:21.847
He never enjoyed any other life as a man,

00:02:22.725 --> 00:02:30.200
but just lived like an ascetic when His wife was lost.

00:02:33.385 --> 00:02:39.546
All these things were to establish also a very

00:02:40.161 --> 00:02:47.304
ideal personality for a man to be attached to His wife.

00:02:48.832 --> 00:02:53.851
He was a person with Ekapatnivrata, means: one wife.

00:02:54.864 --> 00:02:59.751
Though She knew She was Mahalakshmi, She was a Goddess,

00:03:00.466 --> 00:03:11.001
but still He was forced to do things

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:15.146
because He wanted to show how a benevolent king should be.

00:03:20.089 --> 00:03:25.446
In the second incarnation of His, when He came as Shri Krishna,

00:03:27.411 --> 00:03:33.760
then He had to neutralize
all these austerities He has put on people.

00:04:59.015 --> 00:05:03.916
– Ha. So, Shri Krishna came on this earth.

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:14.012
In His childhood He had to also face lots of

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.186
problems which He surpassed,

00:05:20.738 --> 00:05:28.079
and He went and killed His uncle, as you know very well,

00:05:28.881 --> 00:05:30.983
who was a rakshasa.

00:05:31.976 --> 00:05:39.032
After doing all this, then He went to Dwarika, which He built

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.148
– now they have found out where is Dwarika

00:05:42.346 --> 00:05:44.746
– and He became the king of Dwarika.

00:05:51.077 --> 00:05:52.877
To understand Shri Krishna

00:05:54.946 --> 00:06:00.398
in Sahaja Yoga is much more subtler
than the stories that they tell.

00:06:00.518 --> 00:06:02.451
[aside] … move it – better. ?

00:06:06.343 --> 00:06:09.577
The stories are there,

00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:12.235
but behind these stories,

00:06:12.434 --> 00:06:16.234
as being Sahaja Yogis, you have to see the subtle things

00:06:16.621 --> 00:06:19.934
about His incarnation.

00:06:20.966 --> 00:06:25.880
So, the first one was, He was Leeladhara,

00:06:27.032 --> 00:06:29.898
means the One who said this is all a play.

00:06:31.794 --> 00:06:34.527
That means you have to become a witness.

00:06:35.444 --> 00:06:39.244
So, He said that your mind should become just a witness.

00:06:42.071 --> 00:06:46.235
At Virata stage He becomes Akbar.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:53.358
And at that stage He is the mind, the brain of

00:06:55.858 --> 00:06:57.725
the great primordial Being.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:06.711
So, first He thinks that we have to become witness,

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:09.617
witness of the drama,

00:07:10.967 --> 00:07:18.538
and we should not get lost into the Maya.

00:07:35.482 --> 00:07:41.831
If you are a witness you can see the Maya, how it works.

00:07:42.962 --> 00:07:52.041
So the first, first subtle nature
of Shri Krishna was to create a Leela

00:07:52.399 --> 00:07:58.668
to neutralize all the austerities
created by the incarnation of Shri Rama.

00:07:59.819 --> 00:08:04.414
But the second great quality

00:08:05.585 --> 00:08:10.902
that He had is also to put the Maya on people.

00:08:13.422 --> 00:08:19.652
So, if He is the brain, our brain should become a sakshi,

00:08:20.585 --> 00:08:24.815
should become a witness, witness the play.

00:08:25.629 --> 00:08:31.759
You should not take anything as something extremely serious.

00:08:32.593 --> 00:08:36.462
When you look at things as sakshi swarupa, as

00:08:36.621 --> 00:08:39.354
something that you are watching a drama,

00:08:39.696 --> 00:08:45.172
you may for the time being feel that you are Napoleon,
you are the one who is acting.

00:08:45.351 --> 00:08:47.748
But after some time the play is over,

00:08:47.907 --> 00:08:53.264
you know it’s a play. So, to reach that state, you have to

00:08:54.455 --> 00:08:58.899
become thoughtlessly aware.

00:08:59.991 --> 00:09:02.649
Because we think from our brain,

00:09:03.503 --> 00:09:07.847
and this brain goes on thinking, thinking, creating a Maya,

00:09:08.661 --> 00:09:10.726
and playing into Maya.

00:09:11.416 --> 00:09:17.671
Now, here it is when you are a realized soul,
you should see through the Maya.

00:09:18.762 --> 00:09:24.615
Everything that I am doing or you are doing,

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:34.106
should be understood very well if you are really

00:09:35.634 --> 00:09:39.542
the reflection of Shri Krishna’s brain.

00:09:41.051 --> 00:09:45.396
So, in your brain, there should be no worry,

00:09:45.852 --> 00:09:49.519
there should be no stress, there should be no problem,

00:09:51.686 --> 00:09:55.685
because you are just watching everything

00:09:56.003 --> 00:09:58.463
in thoughtless awareness.

00:09:59.158 --> 00:10:01.825
So, when you are thoughtless awareness,

00:10:02.392 --> 00:10:08.284
means when your brain is just in the state of witness,

00:10:09.535 --> 00:10:14.547
you understand everything that is Divine.

00:10:14.865 --> 00:10:18.065
I’ll give you an example, just now it happened.

00:10:18.218 --> 00:10:22.861
I got into the car and they didn’t know where to go,

00:10:23.576 --> 00:10:27.709
and we went onto wrong road, then I told him ” Go this way “.

00:10:28.516 --> 00:10:32.783
So he was wondering ” How Mother knows?” I said ” Vibrations! ”

00:10:35.168 --> 00:10:39.194
Through vibrations I could feel we are ther
– they are all there, sitting there,

00:10:39.452 --> 00:10:40.786
– and we came round.

00:10:43.758 --> 00:10:49.425
Unless and untill you are thoughtlessly aware,
you cannot grow, that is first thing.

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:57.309
And secondly, unless and until you are thoughtlessly aware,
you do not know the absolute Truth.

00:10:58.659 --> 00:11:01.259
Through your brain only you will know.

00:11:02.287 --> 00:11:06.754
You don’t have to put your hands, you don’t have to ask questions.

00:11:07.081 --> 00:11:12.755
But it’s like a computer that works, it just gives you an answer.

00:11:13.887 --> 00:11:17.487
In that state you are completely one with the Divine,

00:11:17.696 --> 00:11:20.652
and it just gives you an answer,

00:11:21.109 --> 00:11:24.976
and you do that and you are amazed how it has worked out.

00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:30.233
Everything, every moment is computerized with Shri Krishna.

00:11:32.411 --> 00:11:35.843
But at the same time He tests you,

00:11:37.272 --> 00:11:41.379
He plays His Leela on you. That one must know,

00:11:42.034 --> 00:11:43.701
because He’s a diplomat.

00:11:44.911 --> 00:11:49.709
How He has played Leela on you is very interesting to see,

00:11:50.821 --> 00:11:52.087
His style of Leela.

00:11:54.233 --> 00:11:55.700
Like He’s told Arjuna

00:12:02.998 --> 00:12:04.798
that ” I will not fight “.

00:12:10.098 --> 00:12:13.589
Arjuna said: ” All right, what will you do? ”

00:12:13.748 --> 00:12:17.161
” I’ll be your charioteer,

00:12:17.481 --> 00:12:19.148
I’ll drive your chariot.

00:12:19.743 --> 00:12:23.836
” Now it would look funny to anybody: ”
What is this, such a great man

00:12:24.095 --> 00:12:26.388
who calls me as His guru,

00:12:26.646 --> 00:12:28.779
He says that He is the one who,

00:12:28.988 --> 00:12:32.182
I mean, He says that I am the best of His disciples,

00:12:32.321 --> 00:12:38.236
everything, and here He just offers
His services like a charioteer. ”

00:12:40.326 --> 00:12:48.532
In this, He is just trying a trick on Arjuna.

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:55.358
As if He knows the future that’s going to happen.

00:12:56.648 --> 00:13:02.699
So, the whole Gita was created because He was just a charioteer,

00:13:03.793 --> 00:13:07.959
because Arjuna said ” I cannot fight my own people,

00:13:09.036 --> 00:13:16.388
I cannot fight my own grandparents,
and I cannot fight my relations. ”

00:13:18.174 --> 00:13:21.574
Now, if you say that Gita is for peace, it is not.

00:13:24.206 --> 00:13:25.606
It is not for peace.

00:13:27.618 --> 00:13:31.952
But He says that: ” They are already dead, whom are you killing?

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:37.737
These dead people, if you are killing them what will happen?

00:13:38.538 --> 00:13:42.705
But if you now run away from the battlefield,

00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:46.514
people will call you a coward,

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:52.227
and what will you get? But if you fight for the religion,

00:13:54.372 --> 00:14:00.745
then you will get your resurrection – moksha.”

00:14:02.035 --> 00:14:04.568
It’s a big trick in all these things.

00:14:05.387 --> 00:14:10.776
Same was said by Mohammed Sahib, and same by Christians later,

00:14:11.432 --> 00:14:18.256
same about the Hindus
– that they all feel they are fighting for Dharma.

00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:24.470
In Arjuna’s case, it was a clear-cut case

00:14:25.023 --> 00:14:29.439
that somebody was a rakshasa and horrible people,

00:14:29.578 --> 00:14:33.645
they were adharmis, so He was fighting them, it’s all right.

00:14:36.642 --> 00:14:42.375
But what about other people when they say that ” We are going to

00:14:42.753 --> 00:14:49.812
die for religion “? I met a Bosnia muslim
who had just somewhere escaped

00:14:50.308 --> 00:14:53.732
and I asked Him ” Why, why do you want to fight?

00:14:53.911 --> 00:15:02.026
Why do you want to fight for land
when you believe in the formless God? ”

00:15:02.423 --> 00:15:06.661
He said: ” It’s written in the Koran that if you fight for religion

00:15:06.959 --> 00:15:11.825
then you will get your moksha.
” Exactly the same Shri Krishna has said.

00:15:14.955 --> 00:15:16.688
But where is the mistake?

00:15:18.268 --> 00:15:21.819
The mistake is: what is the Dharma?

00:15:24.347 --> 00:15:30.348
Are you dharmic? Are you in – standing in Dharma?

00:15:32.141 --> 00:15:37.312
Then this fight was in those days, were with weapons.

00:15:37.967 --> 00:15:41.700
So, why did Shri Krishna not take a weapon in His hand?

00:15:43.522 --> 00:15:48.204
This is the second. Firstly, nobody has Dharma,

00:15:48.483 --> 00:15:51.954
they’re all adharmis
– they may call themselves hindus, muslims, christians

00:15:52.094 --> 00:15:54.945
– all are adharmis, they don’t follow the religion.

00:15:55.064 --> 00:15:59.389
And secondly, they are killing each other only,

00:15:59.528 --> 00:16:01.862
one adharmi killing other adharmi,

00:16:01.989 --> 00:16:05.183
or maybe in between themselves they are fighting: everybody

00:16:05.322 --> 00:16:09.656
is thinking ” I am right and whatever I am doing is the right. ”

00:16:10.420 --> 00:16:14.820
So, the first condition is put that for Dharma you have to fight.

00:16:14.980 --> 00:16:18.914
So first, one should find out: are we fighting for Dharma?

00:16:21.052 --> 00:16:23.194
But He was even subtler,

00:16:23.889 --> 00:16:27.222
He didn’t take any weapons in His hands, nothing.

00:16:27.929 --> 00:16:32.154
He was just holding the reins of the chariot.

00:16:33.841 --> 00:16:36.996
Because Shri Krishna is the mind,

00:16:37.413 --> 00:16:42.789
is the Virat, is the great Mind,
He doesn’t need any weapons or such.

00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.040
But what He did at that time,

00:16:46.302 --> 00:16:52.745
He used His mind for a very very profound knowledge,

00:16:54.015 --> 00:16:57.215
to explain to Arjuna. Imagine, in the warfield,

00:16:57.454 --> 00:17:01.255
He didn’t make Him sit down
” All right, you are my Shishya, you sit here,

00:17:01.374 --> 00:17:03.574
I am your guru, I’ll tell you. ”

00:17:04.172 --> 00:17:06.772
– nothing. In the battlefield you see,

00:17:07.843 --> 00:17:14.541
when everybody was there to fight
and they were about to start the war,

00:17:15.513 --> 00:17:24.183
He starts telling very patiently to Arjuna, at that time.

00:17:25.652 --> 00:17:30.813
Now, what is He doing there? He’s not using any weapons, nothing.

00:17:30.992 --> 00:17:39.365
He is being counselling, counselling to Arjuna, telling him.

00:17:41.191 --> 00:17:44.107
Now, see His subtle brain.

00:17:46.250 --> 00:17:49.861
He introduces in the first chapter only that

00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.980
” You have to go higher then what you are. ”

00:17:54.414 --> 00:17:56.509
And then He gives him

00:17:56.946 --> 00:18:02.479
the definition of a person who
is an enlightened person which is a Sthitha Pragya.

00:18:04.604 --> 00:18:08.176
I mean, normally, a businessman will start

00:18:08.275 --> 00:18:12.124
from one dollar, then hundred dollars,
you see, the other way round.

00:18:12.303 --> 00:18:15.013
But He told him first thing

00:18:15.569 --> 00:18:20.102
that ” You have to become a Sthitha Pragya, otherwise it’s no use.”

00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:26.080
Unless and until you become
Sthitha Pragya you cannot have Dharma,

00:18:26.243 --> 00:18:27.510
this is the point.

00:18:28.148 --> 00:18:31.404
To understand Shri Krishna, you have to really have a very

00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:33.924
subtle brain, otherwise you cannot understand.

00:18:35.552 --> 00:18:39.021
So, He tells that ” You should

00:18:40.092 --> 00:18:45.885
give up this kind of a morose that has developed in you,

00:18:45.985 --> 00:18:47.732
Kaivalya I will call it.

00:18:48.586 --> 00:18:52.891
And what you have to do, now take up the weapon in your hand

00:18:53.129 --> 00:18:54.557
and fight. ”

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:04.870
So, then, He asked him about other things,

00:19:06.379 --> 00:19:10.009
” What about that: You are here telling me

00:19:10.227 --> 00:19:12.427
that you should become Nishkriya,

00:19:13.104 --> 00:19:17.789
that means “no work”. Your karmas become akarmas.

00:19:18.008 --> 00:19:19.674
Now, talking like this,

00:19:19.834 --> 00:19:24.034
and why do you want me to kill these people – that is akarma? ”

00:19:25.368 --> 00:19:29.130
Now, how you see, slowly removes from one point

00:19:29.407 --> 00:19:33.098
that you should fight for Dharma. Now, it’s a very subtle thing:

00:19:33.278 --> 00:19:36.545
are you in Dharma or not, first of all find out?

00:19:37.544 --> 00:19:43.059
You are not, so what Dharma you fight, first?

00:19:43.556 --> 00:19:46.313
Then, the second thing is karma.

00:19:47.998 --> 00:19:53.824
Again, see, He is a brainy fellow, the brains of God,

00:19:54.549 --> 00:19:56.354
extremely tricky.

00:19:57.290 --> 00:20:02.250
The second trick He plays on Him saying that

00:20:04.393 --> 00:20:13.654
” You are working, all right? But if you are a Sthitha Pragya,

00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:21.293
then you leave all the work at the lotus feet of God ” or Him.

00:20:22.365 --> 00:20:25.598
[Hindi phrase, UNCLEAR]

00:20:25.976 --> 00:20:28.297
“Give up all Dharmas and follow Me. ”

00:20:30.415 --> 00:20:32.015
Now what is his Dharma?

00:20:33.332 --> 00:20:36.085
That problem is that people don’t understand Him.

00:20:36.224 --> 00:20:39.696
It’s all concentrated on Shri Krishna, and

00:20:39.855 --> 00:20:44.815
His own manifestation.

00:20:45.312 --> 00:20:47.256
[aside]

00:20:51.423 --> 00:20:54.628
He says that ” Do your karmas.

00:20:55.403 --> 00:20:59.589
But you put them at the lotus feet of the Lord! ”

00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:04.727
– It’s not possible unless and until you are Sthitha Pragya,

00:21:04.946 --> 00:21:06.922
unless and until you are enlightened.

00:21:07.022 --> 00:21:11.152
Now, when you are enlightened,
when you have got your realization,

00:21:11.255 --> 00:21:15.612
when you raise your Kundalini or anybody’s Kundalini,

00:21:15.950 --> 00:21:21.565
you don’t say ” Mother, I am giving realization “.
You don’t say that, never.

00:21:22.478 --> 00:21:26.763
What you say: ” It is happening “, in third person you talk. ”

00:21:27.140 --> 00:21:31.607
It’s not coming, it’s not working or it’s just moving on the side.

00:21:31.724 --> 00:21:34.342
This chakra is catching, that chakra is catching.

00:21:34.502 --> 00:21:38.807
” You never say ” I am doing anything “, the ‘I’ is lost.

00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:48.975
When that ‘I’ is lost, than only
you will put everything at the lotus feet of God.

00:21:49.452 --> 00:21:52.052
So, first, it should be done in Dharma.

00:21:52.407 --> 00:21:55.840
Supposing, somebody murders somebody and say ” Oh, I have

00:21:56.019 --> 00:22:00.245
done it now, so it is my karmas
and I put it at the lotus feet of Shri Krishna. ”

00:22:00.622 --> 00:22:04.422
Now, people can, I mean, people have special brains also

00:22:05.146 --> 00:22:08.310
to interprete Shri Krishna and Gita.

00:22:09.441 --> 00:22:12.258
But what He said for Dharma you should do it.

00:22:12.833 --> 00:22:18.100
So, first of all, you should be
a Sthitha Pragya, means an enlightened person,

00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:20.265
and whatever you do

00:22:20.524 --> 00:22:24.524
automatically goes at the lotus feet of God, automatically,

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.952
spontaneously, Sahaj.

00:22:30.703 --> 00:22:33.232
Now, the third thing He did:

00:22:33.907 --> 00:22:37.021
What about bhakti? People said ” What?

00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:42.380
We are doing bhakti to God, this,
that, then what is the reward for this? ”

00:22:42.538 --> 00:22:44.472
There again He plays tricks.

00:22:45.455 --> 00:22:48.855
On one word He has made everybody dance, you know?

00:22:50.395 --> 00:22:55.404
He says ” You do bhakti, but it should be Ananya, ”

00:22:55.578 --> 00:22:59.888
– this is the word, Ananya, – when there is not the other,

00:23:00.405 --> 00:23:04.313
means when you have become One with Me,

00:23:04.809 --> 00:23:09.009
means you are a Sthitha Pragya, means you are a realized soul.

00:23:11.694 --> 00:23:16.111
Just imagine, on this word if people pay attention,

00:23:16.349 --> 00:23:19.416
they will give up all this nonsense of bhakti

00:23:19.781 --> 00:23:25.634
and will first get their connection when they become Ananya

00:23:25.793 --> 00:23:27.393
and then do the bhakti.

00:23:29.266 --> 00:23:32.599
Because Shri Krishna knew human beings very well.

00:23:33.036 --> 00:23:37.203
I think, He knew them better than Christ
– definitely

00:23:38.405 --> 00:23:41.437
– because Christ was straightforward.

00:23:41.636 --> 00:23:44.533
He said: ” Take out your right eye, throw it away.

00:23:44.672 --> 00:23:47.092
Take out your left eye, throw it away.

00:23:47.212 --> 00:23:49.145
Cut your hand, throw it away.

00:23:49.474 --> 00:23:52.540
” Same with Mohammed Sahib. Who will do that?

00:23:54.057 --> 00:23:58.818
So, Shri Krishna was very clever, He said:

00:23:59.017 --> 00:24:01.817
straightforward they will not understand,

00:24:01.969 --> 00:24:06.651
so give them in such a way that they will go on doing and doing,

00:24:06.787 --> 00:24:10.679
we are doing so much bhakti, so many people come into it.
Even this Ram,

00:24:10.877 --> 00:24:14.686
Hari Ramas, they are developing now throat cancers.

00:24:14.965 --> 00:24:18.675
So, they are saying ” Mother, why these throat cancer to us,

00:24:18.814 --> 00:24:23.681
we are saying the name of Sri Krishna?”
” Because you are not connected.”

00:24:24.776 --> 00:24:29.887
Now supposing, I will even want to
meet the president of this country.

00:24:30.364 --> 00:24:34.966
I’ll have to go through such a protocol. I may not even meet.

00:24:37.903 --> 00:24:41.990
But this One is the God of Gods.

00:24:43.359 --> 00:24:46.226
He is the President of all the presidents.

00:24:48.079 --> 00:24:53.028
If you have to take His name, if you go and take name of Lincoln,

00:24:53.128 --> 00:24:58.594
of Clinton, and go on saying
” Clinton, Clinton Clinton “, they’ll all arrest Me.

00:24:59.556 --> 00:25:05.964
So, if you go on saying ” Rama, Rama, Rama,
Allah, Allah, Allah, Akbar, Akbar, Akbar “, you’ll be arrested.

00:25:06.124 --> 00:25:07.724
You have no connection.

00:25:10.271 --> 00:25:12.804
So, that Virata Shakti which we call,

00:25:14.651 --> 00:25:18.282
which is of course in Koran described as Akbar,

00:25:20.822 --> 00:25:25.028
this power also plays tricks.

00:25:31.854 --> 00:25:35.286
As a Mother, I have to warn you

00:25:37.233 --> 00:25:44.248
that nothing will work out
unless (and) until you are a realized soul.

00:25:45.062 --> 00:25:49.625
Nothing will work out. Now, for realization,

00:25:50.499 --> 00:25:52.966
He has said: ” You have to become “.

00:25:53.356 --> 00:25:56.689
But He didn’t say at that time

00:25:57.562 --> 00:26:02.113
how you will become, what will work it out.

00:26:03.878 --> 00:26:07.078
Because you see, sort of, if you go to college,

00:26:07.227 --> 00:26:10.293
all the knowledge is not given in first year.

00:26:10.446 --> 00:26:13.045
Something is given, then something in second year,

00:26:13.184 --> 00:26:17.851
then in third year. Now in the seventh year,
now Sahaja Yoga has come

00:26:18.046 --> 00:26:20.605
to tell you everything, totally.

00:26:22.292 --> 00:26:27.903
He is Totality, but He doesn’t give total knowledge.

00:26:28.935 --> 00:26:31.535
The whole knowledge of Gita is nothing

00:26:31.790 --> 00:26:36.057
but trick that He has played with human beings who were stupid,

00:26:36.235 --> 00:26:38.359
and would never have understood Him

00:26:38.558 --> 00:26:41.092
if He’d told them about Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:41.237 --> 00:26:44.237
Even today I meet many like that, of course,

00:26:44.788 --> 00:26:49.348
but so many He could not have got at that time.

00:26:50.103 --> 00:26:55.777
So, they didn’t talk about Kundalini this much, so far,

00:26:56.214 --> 00:26:57.840
and that’s all.

00:27:01.432 --> 00:27:03.824
Same with other people.

00:27:04.141 --> 00:27:08.994
The kind of disciples they had, the kind of people they had,

00:27:09.154 --> 00:27:14.999
they could not tell them everything about

00:27:15.416 --> 00:27:20.137
their ascent, because they were not ready,

00:27:20.376 --> 00:27:24.776
they were not of that level, their brains were not that developed.

00:27:25.059 --> 00:27:28.716
Now in this Kali Yuga, when I am starting this work,

00:27:28.955 --> 00:27:32.486
I find their brains are overdeveloped, over.

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:38.895
And so much so that overdeveloped brains become stupid

00:27:39.086 --> 00:27:44.470
and that’s really. Overuse of anything makes you stupid,

00:27:45.701 --> 00:27:49.264
and they become absolutely stupid.

00:27:50.693 --> 00:27:54.256
Now, how can you tell them such a subtle knowledge

00:27:54.574 --> 00:27:59.157
who are stupid people? What is the way?

00:28:00.130 --> 00:28:03.185
If I talk like Shri Krishna

00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:07.264
it would have been just a waste of My energy

00:28:07.483 --> 00:28:11.349
and your energy. Half of you would have gone off to sleep.

00:28:11.610 --> 00:28:16.252
So I said, first of all, let Me connect them to Divinity.

00:28:16.808 --> 00:28:21.208
If I could connect them to Divinity – little bit even, little bit

00:28:21.411 --> 00:28:23.345
– then they will understand.

00:28:23.574 --> 00:28:27.174
Because that will enlighten their brain a little bit,

00:28:27.648 --> 00:28:31.370
and they will know that there’s something more than what we know.

00:28:31.807 --> 00:28:34.407
And that’s how it is going to work out.

00:28:34.902 --> 00:28:39.170
So the subtle system of trickery of Shri Krishna

00:28:39.368 --> 00:28:42.384
has helped a lot, no doubt, that people are realizing

00:28:42.603 --> 00:28:47.935
that there is something missing in it. Even of Islam

00:28:49.344 --> 00:28:55.653
– Islam means surrender – but surrender to whom? To mullahs

00:28:56.368 --> 00:29:04.901
– or to whom? The problem started when
[Hijak, a name – UNCLEAR] he started like that.

00:29:05.119 --> 00:29:07.690
There are mullahs and there are this.

00:29:07.869 --> 00:29:10.222
So, the surrender part became

00:29:10.342 --> 00:29:15.875
surrender to these stupid mullahs.
I’ve seen most of them are absolutely stupid.

00:29:16.551 --> 00:29:19.899
And they take a cane in their hands in the other, you see

00:29:20.062 --> 00:29:22.262
they beat, even women they beat.

00:29:22.419 --> 00:29:24.920
You are supposed to do Pujas five times

00:29:25.039 --> 00:29:28.868
and if you don’t do them, Pujas five times,
they call it silla [UNCLEAR],

00:29:29.027 --> 00:29:34.039
then they beat women. Every shop must be closed five times.

00:29:35.646 --> 00:29:40.289
I tell you, they are such hypocritical people naturally,

00:29:41.261 --> 00:29:45.195
because if you are asked to do five times meditation, say,

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:49.018
you will never do it, but you will just do it out of fear.

00:29:49.186 --> 00:29:52.386
Out of fear if you do something, what’s the use?

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:58.010
Now, whatever Muhammed Sahib has said or Christ has said,

00:29:58.774 --> 00:30:04.071
it is only for angels, I can tell you, not for normal people.

00:30:05.381 --> 00:30:11.234
And where are the angels? Very few there are:

00:30:11.749 --> 00:30:15.683
those are born-realized people who have come on this earth

00:30:15.844 --> 00:30:23.363
are angels. And they are told not to do something they will not do.

00:30:23.899 --> 00:30:27.562
Most of them know what is right and wrong.

00:30:27.765 --> 00:30:30.032
Where are those angels, very few?

00:30:31.253 --> 00:30:36.153
And those who are angels are treated just like, you can call it,

00:30:37.541 --> 00:30:42.017
like packed people or lunatic people, – nobody believes them.

00:30:42.514 --> 00:30:46.938
One here and one there and one in some other place.

00:30:47.633 --> 00:30:53.069
So this, what they preached was for the angels.

00:30:53.644 --> 00:30:55.911
Only the angels could understand.

00:30:56.129 --> 00:31:00.123
But Shri Krishna thought that these other people who are there,

00:31:00.257 --> 00:31:02.924
who are not angels, why not trick them?

00:31:04.483 --> 00:31:09.883
Many people come and tell me: ”
We take the name of Krishna every day like this,

00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:12.286
and we haven’t received anything.

00:31:13.055 --> 00:31:16.788
” But first He said, ” You have to be Sthitha Pragya. ”

00:31:17.102 --> 00:31:22.429
Sthitha Pragya: ‘Sthitha’ means established,

00:31:23.163 --> 00:31:26.040
‘Pragya’ means enlightened,

00:31:27.032 --> 00:31:33.956
– you should be enlightened personality, absolutely established.

00:31:34.644 --> 00:31:38.244
First thing, first thing you see, in a second chapter.

00:31:38.592 --> 00:31:43.413
First thing is it. After that He says all these things,

00:31:43.969 --> 00:31:49.445
and that’s why many people have misunderstood Gita.

00:31:50.041 --> 00:31:53.574
But His idea was: in one life they’ll misunderstand,

00:31:53.808 --> 00:31:56.141
second life they’ll misunderstand,

00:31:56.288 --> 00:32:00.318
third life they will start thinking ” After all, what is this?”

00:32:00.457 --> 00:32:04.941
First, He has said “You become a Sthitha Pragya”,
we have not become a Sthitha Pragya.

00:32:05.159 --> 00:32:07.026
So, what’s wrong with us? ”

00:32:07.917 --> 00:32:10.251
So, some introspection will start.

00:32:10.695 --> 00:32:13.948
That was His idea, idea I should say.

00:32:14.581 --> 00:32:21.069
But I have seen people
who can give lectures on Gita hours together,

00:32:21.387 --> 00:32:25.454
but their brains are closed completely.

00:32:27.657 --> 00:32:32.057
Now, to say that He didn’t say anything about Kundalini is there.

00:32:32.577 --> 00:32:38.481
That’s why Gyaneshwara in
the twelvth century took permission from his brother

00:32:38.958 --> 00:32:43.625
who was his guru that ”Allow me, at least, to say about Kundalini.”

00:32:44.553 --> 00:32:47.553
And that is how it was exposed a little bit.

00:32:48.469 --> 00:32:50.723
Of course, before that also,

00:32:51.119 --> 00:32:57.430
we have had people like Adi Shankaracharya, the sixth century,

00:32:57.926 --> 00:33:01.612
and before that also Markandeya.

00:33:02.483 --> 00:33:08.993
But they talked about the Kundalini,
that’s all, praised the Kundalini.

00:33:09.986 --> 00:33:14.986
But that She passes through six centers,
how will It raise and all that.

00:33:15.521 --> 00:33:19.321
And not about the future, that this will happen one day.

00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:22.220
So many have written, of course.

00:33:22.453 --> 00:33:27.787
But I would say that precisely the one who has written

00:33:28.398 --> 00:33:33.442
complete description of Sahaja Yogis even is by Gyaneshwara

00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:40.386
in the poetry called Pasaydan in which
he exactly said what will happen,

00:33:41.002 --> 00:33:45.029
how many people will get realization

00:33:45.446 --> 00:33:47.779
and he said that ” You the people,

00:33:48.769 --> 00:34:02.201
who are the forests of the trees,
boon-giving trees, Kalpakaruna, boon-giving trees,

00:34:02.757 --> 00:34:07.260
you rise and give it to others.

00:34:07.549 --> 00:34:14.767
” Then he says that ” You are the oceans who are

00:34:16.082 --> 00:34:19.172
giving ambrosia talks.”

00:34:20.046 --> 00:34:23.246
He has described you in such a beautiful manner

00:34:24.173 --> 00:34:27.439
that you should read the translation of Pasaydan

00:34:27.843 --> 00:34:30.310
and then you will know what you are,

00:34:30.581 --> 00:34:36.381
how you have been praised by him.
And he said that you will loose other relationship

00:34:36.612 --> 00:34:39.412
and the only relationships will be these.

00:34:40.064 --> 00:34:42.862
They will be your real relations.

00:34:43.378 --> 00:34:46.578
To say all these things, to have such a vision,

00:34:46.719 --> 00:34:50.322
he must be a great incarnation himself.

00:34:50.858 --> 00:35:01.085
So, this is how in Gyaneshwari, which is a commentary of Gita,

00:35:01.243 --> 00:35:05.377
he has put in the sixth chapter, now is a commentary on Gita,

00:35:05.550 --> 00:35:10.016
but in the sixth chapter he said how you can get your realization.

00:35:10.947 --> 00:35:13.547
About Kundalini, how it will work out.

00:35:13.804 --> 00:35:16.935
So, gradually it was all unfolded.

00:35:17.392 --> 00:35:20.328
And gradually people also developed

00:35:20.527 --> 00:35:22.927
their spiritual state to understand.

00:35:23.245 --> 00:35:27.378
Supposing, I had started Sahaja Yoga even hundred years back,

00:35:27.590 --> 00:35:32.057
I would not have even one single disciple, one single Sahaja Yogi.

00:35:32.293 --> 00:35:36.816
The reason was, the people were all right,
they were on value system, all right.

00:35:36.935 --> 00:35:40.814
Their life was very much satisfying, they were very peaceful.

00:35:40.934 --> 00:35:44.624
They were just interested in some horses or something like that.

00:35:44.763 --> 00:35:50.100
But now, you find people are so much disturbed,

00:35:50.279 --> 00:35:54.545
so much in trouble, so much in chaos this in Kali Yuga,

00:35:54.783 --> 00:35:58.791
it’s the height of Kali Yuga now. So much of immorality,

00:35:59.089 --> 00:36:03.076
so much of dissatisfaction in life

00:36:03.317 --> 00:36:07.543
that they have to now think where to go.

00:36:08.317 --> 00:36:12.166
Like a shock the future is waiting for them

00:36:12.353 --> 00:36:15.886
and now what should they achieve. So, the whole this

00:36:17.482 --> 00:36:25.589
Bhranti, illusion of life starts staring at them,

00:36:25.848 --> 00:36:29.597
and then they start thinking ” What is this, what am I doing,

00:36:29.795 --> 00:36:32.415
what have I done, why is it so?

00:36:32.713 --> 00:36:36.264
Why everything in a chaos, why is it happening? ”

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.693
Then the seeking starts and with their seeking now,
you know what has happened,

00:36:41.831 --> 00:36:44.251
that you all have got your realization.

00:36:44.392 --> 00:36:49.173
Without the seeking it would not
have been even possible for Me to talk to you

00:36:49.351 --> 00:36:51.514
at all about Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:51.672 --> 00:36:54.351
It is because you are seekers I can talk to you.

00:36:54.490 --> 00:36:56.545
And it has worked out,

00:36:56.665 --> 00:36:59.999
I am very happy that it has worked out in America.

00:37:01.375 --> 00:37:06.474
Another quality, is a great quality of Shri Krishna, is that

00:37:06.752 --> 00:37:11.903
He is Gujara [HINDI ?], means

00:37:12.777 --> 00:37:16.725
His element is firmament, what we call Akash,

00:37:17.598 --> 00:37:20.733
and He penetrates into everything.

00:37:21.626 --> 00:37:28.774
He penetrates into everything. He penetrates into the

00:37:30.075 --> 00:37:36.552
– what do you call that – anu, renu, paramanu,

00:37:36.731 --> 00:37:46.393
three things – atoms. Into little atoms it goes and it shakes them.

00:37:46.989 --> 00:37:50.055
Now, if you ask any scientist, he’ll tell you

00:37:50.263 --> 00:37:56.841
that there is an asymetric, symetric vibrations even in atoms.

00:37:57.377 --> 00:38:01.784
Now, how can this energy be existing there?

00:38:02.003 --> 00:38:05.177
Because He can penetrate into anything

00:38:05.435 --> 00:38:09.403
and because of this, He’s so penetrating,

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:14.086
that He encompasses everything:

00:38:14.523 --> 00:38:23.080
into matter, into animals, into human beings, into realized souls

00:38:23.564 --> 00:38:29.826
He penetrates. In the matter it is just a vibrations,

00:38:30.274 --> 00:38:33.230
in the animals it is just a guiding force,

00:38:33.386 --> 00:38:35.452
it’s tremendous guiding force.

00:38:41.219 --> 00:38:46.842
Like birds from Siberia flying down to Australia:

00:38:48.013 --> 00:38:50.613
who gives them the sense of direction?

00:38:51.267 --> 00:38:53.280
We never think about it.

00:38:56.217 --> 00:39:00.879
There are so many things animals are doing.

00:39:01.178 --> 00:39:04.570
They have such a sense of understanding.

00:39:04.848 --> 00:39:08.955
Like a tiger in the, say, in the forest:

00:39:09.392 --> 00:39:12.764
all the animals know that there is a tiger in the forest,

00:39:12.924 --> 00:39:15.790
they are all quiet, respecting their king.

00:39:16.365 --> 00:39:21.643
He kills, say one cow or could be some animal,

00:39:21.941 --> 00:39:27.575
they just respect him. The thing what he has killed is left

00:39:28.072 --> 00:39:30.928
for one day, nobody touches it.

00:39:31.623 --> 00:39:35.869
See the protocol: now when he comes back next day,

00:39:36.088 --> 00:39:38.524
he eats to his own satisfaction,

00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:42.253
then the tigress, then the children, they eat.

00:39:42.830 --> 00:39:48.822
Once they have finished with it,
then one by one, in the order of protocol,

00:39:49.299 --> 00:39:53.346
all the animals eat that animal,

00:39:53.842 --> 00:39:57.195
the last of all are crows

00:39:58.505 --> 00:40:02.937
which are perhaps vegetarians, I should say.

00:40:03.218 --> 00:40:09.445
But the protocol is maintained.

00:40:10.120 --> 00:40:15.893
If a lion is sitting,

00:40:16.390 --> 00:40:22.124
you can make it out there won’t be even a little sound anywhere.

00:40:24.765 --> 00:40:30.936
So, it guides the animals and animals keep their character.

00:40:31.906 --> 00:40:34.040
They are not like human beings.

00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.862
For example, a snake is a snake and a tiger is a tiger.

00:40:39.299 --> 00:40:42.870
But human beings can be snake, tiger, leopard

00:40:43.049 --> 00:40:44.656
– anything together.

00:40:45.847 --> 00:40:51.180
They might be dogs, they might be
small little worms, they could be anything.

00:40:52.097 --> 00:40:54.230
Combinations of so many things,

00:40:54.763 --> 00:40:58.822
because they have passed through
these Yonis, as they call them, these species.

00:40:59.438 --> 00:41:08.286
So, all these kinds of combinations, permutations,
combinations inside of the past is existing.

00:41:09.179 --> 00:41:13.912
And if somebody can take you to your subconscious,
I have seen this,

00:41:14.140 --> 00:41:16.340
people start barking like a dog,

00:41:17.037 --> 00:41:24.400
and sometimes they behave like tigers, this can happen.

00:41:25.095 --> 00:41:27.793
All this is within us, the past,

00:41:28.211 --> 00:41:32.059
with all these complicated personalities.

00:41:33.056 --> 00:41:40.623
Some are like owls, always very serious, you know, hawk-like,

00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:44.154
some are like chirping birds.

00:41:44.909 --> 00:41:48.509
But there are so many combinations they have in them,

00:41:49.353 --> 00:41:52.547
that it is very difficult, you know,

00:41:53.500 --> 00:41:57.613
to make them little straightforward.

00:41:59.340 --> 00:42:03.740
They are so much entangled. First to remove all the entanglement.

00:42:05.371 --> 00:42:08.061
And then to raise the Kundalini.

00:42:08.459 --> 00:42:11.992
The best part of the organization is, which is made,

00:42:13.419 --> 00:42:17.764
that consciousness is vertically placed.

00:42:18.240 --> 00:42:21.454
Subconscious and Supraconscious sort.

00:42:21.673 --> 00:42:24.206
Supraconscious righthandside of yours

00:42:24.391 --> 00:42:27.325
and the Subconscious lefthandside of yours.

00:42:29.163 --> 00:42:33.630
And in the central the path is left on. This is the Sushumna path.

00:42:34.441 --> 00:42:36.441
It is the Mahalakshmi’s path.

00:42:36.822 --> 00:42:42.330
It is the path, which leads you to the state of Virat,

00:42:42.552 --> 00:42:44.352
to the state of your brain.

00:42:47.926 --> 00:42:53.183
So now, the combination of three things work out.

00:42:53.898 --> 00:42:58.858
The brain is the Virat, heart is Shiva,

00:42:59.553 --> 00:43:04.727
and the liver is Brahmadeva.

00:43:05.145 --> 00:43:08.378
All these three powers are there.

00:43:13.180 --> 00:43:16.533
But at that time, when you are realized,

00:43:16.891 --> 00:43:21.315
then your brain surrenders to Shiva,

00:43:21.752 --> 00:43:25.761
to the principle of Shiva, that is the Spirit.

00:43:26.431 --> 00:43:31.932
Brain is surrendered, surrendered not by force or anything,

00:43:32.388 --> 00:43:37.559
but to absorb the power of the Spirit,

00:43:37.757 --> 00:43:42.420
the brain gets surrendered completely to the Spirit,

00:43:43.234 --> 00:43:45.967
so that the Spirit enlightens the brain.

00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:51.150
It is the enlightenment of the brain

00:43:51.904 --> 00:43:58.619
that gives you all this subtle understanding.

00:43:59.078 --> 00:44:03.043
It is to make your brain understand,

00:44:03.639 --> 00:44:08.817
there are so many blissful happenings, people are blessed:

00:44:09.155 --> 00:44:15.603
once, twice, thrice – then they are surprised,
the brain starts thinking.

00:44:16.059 --> 00:44:19.294
”How did I get this blessing, how did it happen to me,

00:44:19.473 --> 00:44:26.357
how could I get my transformation?” So slowly-slowly

00:44:26.636 --> 00:44:32.032
they start trusting their heart,
means they start trusting their Spirit,

00:44:32.231 --> 00:44:37.588
they start trusting their devotion.

00:44:39.334 --> 00:44:45.675
And this is how the bhakti is absolutely

00:44:46.211 --> 00:44:51.290
done without any desire, without any asking,

00:44:51.469 --> 00:44:55.020
without any obligation, just in oneness.

00:44:55.179 --> 00:45:01.508
Because the brain joins hands with the heart, we can say.

00:45:02.419 --> 00:45:08.966
Now, also the Brahmadeva becomes surrendered.

00:45:10.276 --> 00:45:16.478
As a result, what happens:
that your liver is surrendered to your brain.

00:45:19.989 --> 00:45:25.893
When this happens – when your liver is surrendered to your brain

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:30.458
– whatever you do is all enlightened work.

00:45:31.410 --> 00:45:35.040
Whatever you do: whether you sing,

00:45:35.239 --> 00:45:38.432
whether you’re a government servant, whether anything

00:45:38.593 --> 00:45:41.925
– whatever you do with your brain, anything

00:45:42.064 --> 00:45:44.246
through the Swadishthana

00:45:44.425 --> 00:45:49.183
or through the Brahmadeva, it is an enlightened work.

00:46:02.630 --> 00:46:06.042
As it is the brain which is enlightened,

00:46:06.710 --> 00:46:10.043
which is connected with this All Pervading Power,

00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:16.511
whatever you are doing, whatever your ideas are,

00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:24.626
being absolutely enlightened means that you achieve them.

00:46:27.193 --> 00:46:31.042
Enlightened brain, whatever it thinks,

00:46:31.618 --> 00:46:36.058
it is thinking as well as achieving – both together.

00:46:37.966 --> 00:46:44.374
It’s a thing to be understood that an enlightened person

00:46:45.684 --> 00:46:50.344
has the power to achieve anything.

00:46:52.408 --> 00:46:56.962
But at the same time his desires would be Divine.

00:46:58.172 --> 00:47:02.735
Like the other day we had very few people say in Saritos,

00:47:03.391 --> 00:47:07.855
so all the Sahaja Yogis were extremely unhappy

00:47:08.470 --> 00:47:12.537
as if somebody has died in their family and worse than that.

00:47:13.768 --> 00:47:19.067
Why? Because this was their own work,

00:47:19.419 --> 00:47:26.626
which they could not understand why this enlightened mind of theirs

00:47:26.964 --> 00:47:30.364
could not produce the result, achieve the results.

00:47:32.222 --> 00:47:34.422
And they felt extremely unhappy.

00:47:34.881 --> 00:47:42.548
This shows what identification there is for the spiritual work,

00:47:43.064 --> 00:47:46.338
or Divine work and their own lives.

00:47:46.536 --> 00:47:48.936
To them this is the most important.

00:47:49.076 --> 00:47:51.814
And everybody is not like that, of course.

00:47:51.953 --> 00:47:55.088
For some people, something else is more important.

00:47:55.227 --> 00:48:00.187
They may use Sahaja Yoga for their own well-being or anything.

00:48:00.485 --> 00:48:03.152
But those who just think of Sahaja Yoga

00:48:04.510 --> 00:48:08.776
– that’s again the brain which is enlightened. They achieve it.

00:48:09.966 --> 00:48:13.499
But it should not have any selfish motive behind it.

00:48:13.895 --> 00:48:19.350
It should not have any hatred behind it or anything,

00:48:21.354 --> 00:48:25.047
or for some sort of a publicity or some.

00:48:26.317 --> 00:48:33.447
But if it is just the thinking about the Sahaja Yoga work,

00:48:33.588 --> 00:48:36.226
it will be achieved, it will be achieved.

00:48:36.385 --> 00:48:38.652
One should never feel frustrated.

00:48:39.044 --> 00:48:41.911
That’s what is said, that God is with you,

00:48:42.635 --> 00:48:44.480
He is your shepherd.

00:48:44.718 --> 00:48:49.163
And this is what happens when you become

00:48:49.778 --> 00:48:57.247
a surrendered lamb under the guide of this shepherd.

00:49:00.641 --> 00:49:07.485
Then as a result of this brain becoming enlightened,
you start having faith in yourself.

00:49:10.422 --> 00:49:13.222
Nirvikalpa, you become doubtlessly aware.

00:49:13.557 --> 00:49:17.490
As soon as you become, I mean the brain becomes doubtless.

00:49:17.617 --> 00:49:21.438
It’s the brain that thinks,
it’s the brain that doubts, it’s the brain

00:49:21.537 --> 00:49:25.471
that creates all conditionings, the brain that creates ego

00:49:26.339 --> 00:49:31.775
– one instrument doing all this nonsense. Hatred it will create,

00:49:31.914 --> 00:49:37.945
it will justify nonsense, it will criticize others,

00:49:38.283 --> 00:49:43.610
it will hate others, it will make fun of others.

00:49:45.138 --> 00:49:47.872
That is not the quality of Shri Krishna,

00:49:49.027 --> 00:49:51.963
because He is the collective.

00:49:55.555 --> 00:50:00.222
That’s why He never said: ” You are a sinner ”
or anything like that.

00:50:02.559 --> 00:50:05.492
He didn’t criticize anyone.

00:50:07.139 --> 00:50:11.920
After all, I have to criticize, He did not.

00:50:12.337 --> 00:50:16.071
Now, if there was Kamsa, all right, kill him, finished.

00:50:16.187 --> 00:50:17.987
There are Sanda, kill him.

00:50:18.508 --> 00:50:21.980
Any rakshasa, Narakasura, kill him,

00:50:22.397 --> 00:50:27.074
finished, no argument., nothing.
”I have no time for this nonsense. Finish him.”

00:50:27.888 --> 00:50:30.181
Straightforward.

00:50:30.955 --> 00:50:33.555
What is the use of criticizing anyone,

00:50:34.209 --> 00:50:40.141
just kill them. That was as straightforward.

00:50:40.598 --> 00:50:44.665
But by killing them, they again come back in this Kali Yuga.

00:50:47.503 --> 00:50:51.758
So the best thing is to detach people from him,

00:50:52.409 --> 00:50:55.945
from these rakshasas where they are lost.

00:50:56.263 --> 00:51:02.631
That’s the best way. Now,
one way could be that I put it in your brains

00:51:03.088 --> 00:51:09.497
that this is a rakshas. But they won’t believe Me, they won’t.

00:51:10.192 --> 00:51:13.349
So, what happens when you go to them,

00:51:13.607 --> 00:51:18.111
you get all the kinks in your head.

00:51:18.647 --> 00:51:22.314
You start getting pins and needles on your fingertips.

00:51:22.794 --> 00:51:27.257
This is all the activity of brain that it acts on your nerves,

00:51:27.535 --> 00:51:28.836
and you can feel it.

00:51:29.023 --> 00:51:34.095
You start shaking. The other day somebody came and sat before
Me for news just doing like this. ” What is this – Stop it! ”

00:51:34.253 --> 00:51:39.622
” So I can’t, I can’t, I can’t “, he was going on.
I wasn’t doing anything to him, it’s the brain.

00:51:41.191 --> 00:51:46.031
In My presence, the brain acts.

00:51:46.917 --> 00:51:50.383
Because as I told you, He penetrates into anything,

00:51:50.528 --> 00:51:52.594
if I put my glance at somebody.

00:51:54.198 --> 00:51:55.559
The other day,

00:51:55.738 --> 00:52:01.333
there was a boy, very naughty, beats people,
he bites them, these things like that, very crazy.

00:52:01.631 --> 00:52:03.698
As soon as he saw Me ran away.

00:52:04.687 --> 00:52:07.420
He attacks every person but he ran away.

00:52:07.880 --> 00:52:11.809
Then you have seen people who are possessed, what happens to them?

00:52:11.973 --> 00:52:14.973
Just like this, they come to Me, they shake,

00:52:15.153 --> 00:52:18.268
they – sometimes I only worry that they should not faint

00:52:18.429 --> 00:52:22.377
in My presence in the programme, otherwise it’s a headache.

00:52:23.667 --> 00:52:29.222
So, who acts in them, who acts on these people who are possessed,

00:52:29.439 --> 00:52:32.439
who makes all these gestures – is the brain.

00:52:33.547 --> 00:52:36.376
In the brain they have got

00:52:37.012 --> 00:52:40.279
these problems and Shri Krishna makes them shake.

00:52:42.466 --> 00:52:47.159
It’s the tremors that they feel,
the pins and needles that they feel,

00:52:47.299 --> 00:52:52.199
the heat that they feel – all this is central nervous system,

00:52:53.232 --> 00:52:54.699
run by brain.

00:52:55.652 --> 00:53:04.144
So, after enlightenment, what happens that the brain is at peace,

00:53:05.556 --> 00:53:08.392
absolutely at peace with itself.

00:53:09.006 --> 00:53:14.511
It doesn’t react as it used to react.

00:53:14.769 --> 00:53:20.118
Like I’ve seen people here so speedy, so nervous,

00:53:20.872 --> 00:53:24.424
so upset all the time, so jittery, irritable.

00:53:24.742 --> 00:53:27.789
I was reading the life of Mao and I was surprised:

00:53:27.968 --> 00:53:31.678
his physician, personal physician has said even.

00:53:31.896 --> 00:53:37.967
Absolutely like a tyrant and he
used to keep up the faces very well.

00:53:38.246 --> 00:53:44.118
But according to this doctor, he was a cruelest man he had known.

00:53:45.051 --> 00:53:46.440
This is Mao,

00:53:48.107 --> 00:53:54.440
who obviously looked to be a very great reformer,
he did so much for that country, this thing.

00:53:55.091 --> 00:53:59.238
But no, he was a hypocrite. How will you know

00:53:59.595 --> 00:54:03.424
somebody is a hypocrite or not – with your brain?

00:54:03.722 --> 00:54:05.589
Only if you are enlightened.

00:54:06.698 --> 00:54:11.103
So, if Shri Krishna penetrates into your brain,

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:16.182
then you become an enlightened person, Sthitha Pragya,

00:54:16.401 --> 00:54:21.757
and you become knowledgeable, you know everything,

00:54:23.782 --> 00:54:25.777
whatever is necessary.

00:54:26.254 --> 00:54:31.888
You may not know who is number one Wimbledon, maybe.

00:54:32.901 --> 00:54:37.434
You may not know who is the actress, what is her life, you may not.

00:54:38.397 --> 00:54:43.130
You may not know who is the president
of such and such place, maybe.

00:54:44.924 --> 00:54:50.361
But you will know whatever is necessary for you to know.

00:54:51.035 --> 00:54:53.635
Otherwise people waste their energies.

00:54:53.874 --> 00:55:00.421
I know of somebody who knew the telephone numbers

00:55:01.136 --> 00:55:09.528
and the car numbers of two thousand people. What is the need?

00:55:12.247 --> 00:55:20.502
Something like that,
all these stupid things is a waste of mental energy.

00:55:21.112 --> 00:55:25.581
But a Sthitha Pragya does not, he is concentrated

00:55:25.979 --> 00:55:31.891
onto his own knowledge, onto the Divine understanding.

00:55:40.132 --> 00:55:50.670
He works really like a computer, and such an efficient computer.

00:55:53.925 --> 00:55:57.238
Today I just started talking about Kabira.

00:55:57.754 --> 00:56:00.688
Immediately they said ”Mother, vibrations!”

00:56:02.496 --> 00:56:05.563
Taking the name of Kabira you get vibrations.

00:56:08.102 --> 00:56:13.689
But to a normal person nothing, Kabira is nothing, another

00:56:13.908 --> 00:56:15.765
romantic fellow.

00:56:16.717 --> 00:56:21.184
If they don’t want to understand something, they can say anything.

00:56:23.503 --> 00:56:26.236
But only the people who are enlightened,

00:56:26.817 --> 00:56:30.903
their nervous system is so charged

00:56:32.452 --> 00:56:38.565
that they can feel what is wrong, what is right, they can feel

00:56:38.803 --> 00:56:41.819
the Divinity, they can make out

00:56:42.236 --> 00:56:46.283
who are incarnations and who were not.

00:56:48.724 --> 00:56:54.391
You don’t know what has happened to
your nervous system: a new dimension has come.

00:56:55.391 --> 00:57:00.054
Absolutely a new dimension in your nervous system has come,

00:57:00.253 --> 00:57:06.958
which is manifesting, and this is also
the blessings of Shri Krishna.

00:57:08.665 --> 00:57:12.732
Because He is collectiveness within us,

00:57:13.268 --> 00:57:18.427
in the form of collectivity He works.

00:57:26.600 --> 00:57:29.533
Unless and until this America is put right,

00:57:30.638 --> 00:57:36.927
Shri Krishna is not going to leave my throat, I tell you.

00:57:38.098 --> 00:57:47.840
So, as America, I say, is the
place of Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness.

00:57:52.117 --> 00:57:57.751
So, one has to understand what is Shri Krishna’s auspiciousness is.

00:57:58.804 --> 00:58:01.620
They said He had 16.000 wives,

00:58:02.910 --> 00:58:07.592
these were His powers, 16.000 powers He has.

00:58:08.843 --> 00:58:12.043
And to work out His incarnation He wanted them.

00:58:12.593 --> 00:58:19.117
So, they came on this earth as princesses
and was married by a horrible

00:58:19.256 --> 00:58:24.454
king who married them and kept them in the jail.

00:58:25.883 --> 00:58:30.683
So, He fought that king and got
them out of them and He married them.

00:58:32.828 --> 00:58:38.680
It’s the best part of it: He married them. Because, you see,

00:58:39.132 --> 00:58:42.132
with a man, whatever may be his age,

00:58:42.391 --> 00:58:45.922
if he has 16.000 women around him,

00:58:46.437 --> 00:58:50.306
people will never understand that he is Yogeshwara.

00:58:50.723 --> 00:58:54.643
Men have this problem. Not the women so much.

00:58:55.219 --> 00:59:01.219
Because women become mothers, you see,
I’m a Mother, nobody can challenge my character.

00:59:01.787 --> 00:59:06.667
Because I am a Mother. But the fatherhood can be challenged.

00:59:07.838 --> 00:59:09.171
So He married them.

00:59:09.664 --> 00:59:12.997
Then the essence of the five elements He married,

00:59:13.630 --> 00:59:15.276
as five wives.

00:59:18.035 --> 00:59:28.423
But His real sense of morality is seen in the case of Draupadi.

00:59:29.217 --> 00:59:31.551
You know the story of Mahabharata,

00:59:32.689 --> 00:59:37.848
when She was brought in the court of Duryodhana

00:59:38.483 --> 00:59:42.711
(who) asked Dushasana to take out Her saris.

00:59:45.311 --> 00:59:49.934
At that time Tulsidas’s written what happened.

00:59:50.351 --> 00:59:56.342
She was holding Her saree by Her teeth.

00:59:57.578 --> 01:00:00.978
She called ” Krishna “, She could only say ” Kri “,

01:00:01.104 --> 01:00:03.992
‘shna’ means full stop, goes wrong.

01:00:04.132 --> 01:00:08.066
She is holding on with only ‘Kri’, and wouldn’t say ‘shna’.

01:00:08.517 --> 01:00:13.727
But as soon as She said ” Krishna “, the saree fell down.

01:00:14.221 --> 01:00:15.820
Then He describes:

01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:19.551
“Dwarika yashoda jayo yashoda bhayo bari

01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:23.737
shankha chakra gada padma garuda laisi dhary.”

01:00:23.881 --> 01:00:25.821
[Unsure. In Shri Krishna Gitavali of Tulsidas ]

01:00:26.001 --> 01:00:27.282
What did He do?

01:00:27.560 --> 01:00:35.179
When She just said “Krishna”, there was a big sound in Dwarika,

01:00:35.397 --> 01:00:37.123
He was in Dwarika.

01:00:40.318 --> 01:00:42.175
Immediately,

01:00:42.671 --> 01:00:48.286
with “shanka, chakra, gada, padma” – these are His four weapons

01:00:49.100 --> 01:00:50.767
– He came on the Garuda.

01:00:52.730 --> 01:00:58.893
The way it is said is tremendous,
I mean, I feel really, it fulfils your heart with such

01:00:59.231 --> 01:01:05.143
understanding of Shri Krishna. For his own sister,

01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:10.738
He came all the way to save Her chastity.

01:01:11.433 --> 01:01:17.491
To Him the chastity of His sister was of the greatest importance.

01:01:17.610 --> 01:01:20.161
He could have said: ” No, no, no,

01:01:20.281 --> 01:01:25.814
I am a king, I have to look after this,
I have to do that, I have to ” – nothing.

01:01:26.002 --> 01:01:28.454
If Her chastity is in danger,

01:01:28.613 --> 01:01:32.898
He came flying on the Garuda and supplied that.

01:01:33.474 --> 01:01:35.609
And this fellow got tired

01:01:35.729 --> 01:01:38.626
pulling out Her saris. I think, he must have borrowed saris from Me

01:01:38.785 --> 01:01:42.197
because I have too many saris.

01:01:42.772 --> 01:01:45.572
One after the other, one after the other,

01:01:45.689 --> 01:01:48.489
he made a pile of saris and he got tired.

01:01:48.586 --> 01:01:50.453
He could not make Her nude.

01:01:52.376 --> 01:01:58.140
The chastity of Draupadi was of such a height.

01:01:58.818 --> 01:02:05.402
And how Shri Krishna tried to save it is remarkable.

01:02:09.351 --> 01:02:17.168
So, this Yogeshwara Shri Krishna is also a Dhanvantari,

01:02:17.387 --> 01:02:21.838
means the doctor of doctors.

01:02:22.672 --> 01:02:26.739
He is the One who cures. You see, because it’s all the brain

01:02:27.950 --> 01:02:31.616
– and the vibrations which flow on the nervous system.

01:02:33.525 --> 01:02:40.390
So, He cures people through His brain.

01:02:42.937 --> 01:02:51.446
Now, how? Say now, supposing somebody is having a problem, say

01:02:52.216 --> 01:02:59.244
on his heart. So as soon as he puts hands to My photograph,

01:03:01.804 --> 01:03:08.212
so immediately he gets problem on his left finger here.

01:03:08.748 --> 01:03:10.811
The brain is working.

01:03:11.506 --> 01:03:18.502
So in your brain, My vibrations go of Shri Krishna

01:03:20.090 --> 01:03:25.526
and they start sending these messages.

01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:28.454
Because I am also Shri Krishna.

01:03:28.712 --> 01:03:31.688
So this computer acts and immediately

01:03:31.808 --> 01:03:36.142
you know what’s wrong with that person is, he is a heart patient.

01:03:38.594 --> 01:03:41.979
You don’t have to do any diagnosis, you don’t have to do anything.

01:03:42.288 --> 01:03:45.600
Immediately you know. And who does this, it’s the

01:03:45.741 --> 01:03:49.208
principle of Shri Krishna in the brain of the Virat.

01:03:50.708 --> 01:03:55.467
See this, also working for some people, I think.

01:03:55.705 --> 01:03:59.024
Now you are convinced about it, you know that it

01:03:59.145 --> 01:04:02.279
works, it acts like this, it happens like that,

01:04:04.451 --> 01:04:08.741
and how it communicates through you.

01:04:09.079 --> 01:04:14.846
So, this computer of Mine communicates.

01:04:15.095 --> 01:04:17.349
Now, in a computer if you go,

01:04:17.490 --> 01:04:20.421
you can just press the button, of course they are all man-made,

01:04:20.541 --> 01:04:23.474
but whatever it is you then get the result.

01:04:23.576 --> 01:04:32.605
Here it is not like that. It is the
brain automatically gives the result,

01:04:32.762 --> 01:04:36.512
immediately, through the other person.

01:04:39.550 --> 01:04:44.648
And also the same brain tells you what is to be done

01:04:44.827 --> 01:04:47.827
to such and such person, how to work it out.

01:04:48.736 --> 01:04:52.089
The same brain is emitting vibrations,

01:04:53.062 --> 01:04:58.210
and those vibrations are flowing through this brain,

01:05:00.235 --> 01:05:06.127
and they are the ones who tell you what’s wrong with this person.

01:05:10.155 --> 01:05:17.394
So, all this work of penetration is done by Shri Krishna, no doubt.

01:05:20.113 --> 01:05:24.524
He takes these vibrations, puts into another brain,

01:05:24.683 --> 01:05:28.671
and then that brain, that central nervous system starts working

01:05:28.811 --> 01:05:32.144
and then you get the result. But instantaneously,

01:05:33.234 --> 01:05:37.501
it’s not so much time it takes, another way I have described it,

01:05:37.666 --> 01:05:39.469
it just works immediately.

01:05:39.609 --> 01:05:43.275
As soon as they put their hands before Me, immediately!

01:05:47.342 --> 01:05:53.875
So how important it is for us to look after our brain,
for Sahaja Yogis.

01:05:56.524 --> 01:06:01.873
I don’t know in this America how far this brain is safe.

01:06:02.290 --> 01:06:06.357
Because if you open any television, wah wah wah,

01:06:07.231 --> 01:06:09.929
you look outside on the street,

01:06:10.425 --> 01:06:13.837
look out for the – some advertisements

01:06:14.215 --> 01:06:16.437
and you hear this music

01:06:17.588 --> 01:06:19.921
– it breaks your brain completely.

01:06:22.210 --> 01:06:27.824
Whole atmosphere is anti-Shri Krishna.

01:06:31.496 --> 01:06:39.610
No purity of understanding, no sense of morality.

01:06:40.484 --> 01:06:45.916
The way they make pictures, things, horrible violence, horrible,

01:06:47.187 --> 01:06:50.520
I should say, immoral scenes, all sorts of things

01:06:51.115 --> 01:06:55.123
– all created here in the land of Shri Krishna.

01:06:56.492 --> 01:07:06.590
The One who through His waves can completely purify,

01:07:06.784 --> 01:07:14.090
because He’s Yogeshwara, because He is detached,

01:07:15.361 --> 01:07:20.182
absolutely detached, He cannot get attached to anything.

01:07:21.824 --> 01:07:24.157
Only the brain makes you attached.

01:07:24.780 --> 01:07:27.447
Now see, supposing this carpet is here.

01:07:28.478 --> 01:07:30.145
This is a saree, is here.

01:07:30.803 --> 01:07:34.403
I look at the saree, and what a nice is this one now.

01:07:34.939 --> 01:07:38.806
Now, if it is mine, I’m worried it should not get spoiled

01:07:40.634 --> 01:07:44.958
and where it will be kept, what will happen to it.

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:55.288
Goes on worrying about things. Here is any

01:07:55.526 --> 01:08:00.926
more road you walk, there are
shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops, shops.

01:08:01.975 --> 01:08:07.958
– Attention goes there, and in that attention

01:08:08.197 --> 01:08:11.629
this brain gets involved completely.

01:08:12.641 --> 01:08:21.133
It gets involved, it wants this, and wants that,
and wants that, and wants that -for what?

01:08:22.423 --> 01:08:26.307
So, the detachment from the matter is only possible

01:08:28.014 --> 01:08:29.614
if you know generosity.

01:08:33.787 --> 01:08:38.053
But many people are in Sahaja Yoga, but they are not.

01:08:38.649 --> 01:08:40.811
What is generosity now?

01:08:42.418 --> 01:08:46.152
Generosity is now if you like My saree, you’ll have it.

01:08:47.738 --> 01:08:49.605
That’s the real generosity.

01:08:52.355 --> 01:08:57.828
Whatever I am buying is for you, supposing. So you have it.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:03.879
If you have a generous detached temperament,

01:09:04.713 --> 01:09:07.713
then you can never get involved with matter.

01:09:09.098 --> 01:09:12.450
And whatever you are involved, it is love.

01:09:13.125 --> 01:09:17.013
Say, I went to Russia,

01:09:18.581 --> 01:09:25.942
and there was nice fish eggs they call as caviar.

01:09:26.814 --> 01:09:30.348
There’s one doctor who likes it very much in London.

01:09:30.565 --> 01:09:33.098
I said: ” Please, let Me have some “.

01:09:33.263 --> 01:09:36.829
They said: ” Why do you want to take this one? ” ” I want to “.

01:09:36.988 --> 01:09:39.448
They thought of the doctor who needed it there

01:09:39.587 --> 01:09:42.821
who likes it very much and I felt very happy about that.

01:09:42.940 --> 01:09:44.964
And the doctor also was very happy:

01:09:45.103 --> 01:09:48.836
” Mother, you remember even such small thing like this?

01:09:51.876 --> 01:09:58.007
So, the matter has a sense of giving
very great joy to another person.

01:10:00.063 --> 01:10:03.996
If you do it with love, again, I say: ” Do it with love “,

01:10:04.884 --> 01:10:11.531
not with attachment, but with love which is detached.

01:10:13.376 --> 01:10:21.642
He’s the One who is detached.

01:10:22.614 --> 01:10:30.570
So, what is the love that is detached, I’ve told many a times:

01:10:30.803 --> 01:10:36.608
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to every part of the tree

01:10:38.295 --> 01:10:40.495
and is not attached to any part.

01:10:42.501 --> 01:10:45.298
And if it gets attached,

01:10:46.570 --> 01:10:51.303
then the tree will die, and that fruit,
whatever it is, will die also.

01:10:52.858 --> 01:10:55.774
So, what is it a detached love is?

01:10:56.747 --> 01:10:59.614
Detached love is the most beautiful thing.

01:11:01.628 --> 01:11:07.126
Firstly, by detached love you know what to give to whom,

01:11:08.496 --> 01:11:14.071
what will make people happy, what will make them joyous,

01:11:14.488 --> 01:11:16.503
what do they like.

01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:20.492
– In love only you know these things, – what do they like,

01:11:20.650 --> 01:11:29.083
what is their colour, style, what they want. Little, little things.

01:11:30.909 --> 01:11:34.109
As I told you yesterday the story of Shri Rama,

01:11:35.512 --> 01:11:42.338
whatever is done with love, even a little thing that you know

01:11:43.192 --> 01:11:47.125
you would like, I would like to purchase, may look stupid.

01:11:47.577 --> 01:11:50.377
But I know you like it, so I’ll buy that.

01:11:52.041 --> 01:11:54.375
In the same way, you also do that.

01:11:55.809 --> 01:11:59.612
All the time you think ” Mother, what will She like?”

01:11:59.732 --> 01:12:02.798
So, you look for little things here and there.

01:12:05.292 --> 01:12:09.847
But this detachment has to be full and complete.

01:12:10.899 --> 01:12:15.766
Then only you really get people attached to you,
otherwise you cannot.

01:12:16.078 --> 01:12:20.011
If you are not detached, you cannot get

01:12:21.149 --> 01:12:24.145
that complete love for another person.

01:12:24.423 --> 01:12:28.462
Because if you are doing something, say, for money,

01:12:30.586 --> 01:12:33.252
or if you are doing something for lust,

01:12:34.336 --> 01:12:40.010
or for greed, or for some sort of a position, it has no meaning.

01:12:41.022 --> 01:12:45.955
People know
”Oh, I know why he is doing it, because I am such and such“.

01:12:47.879 --> 01:12:52.502
In Sahaja Yoga also many people come either to make money,

01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:55.580
either to get cured, all kinds of things.

01:12:57.701 --> 01:12:59.982
But if you are detached,

01:13:02.026 --> 01:13:05.419
then only Sahaja Yoga will spread.

01:13:07.205 --> 01:13:13.072
As long as there are attachments,
you should know that you are not yet a Sahaja Yogi.

01:13:13.991 --> 01:13:20.391
I am not saying ”You take out your eye or cut your hands”
I didn’t say that, to that extent.

01:13:21.253 --> 01:13:25.003
What I’m saying: you should introspect and see:

01:13:25.459 --> 01:13:29.007
”How much am I attached to this or to that,

01:13:29.206 --> 01:13:34.722
and why am I so much attached, what does it matter?”

01:13:35.158 --> 01:13:37.424
Always, as a result of attachment

01:13:37.638 --> 01:13:39.971
you’ll always find disappointments.

01:13:40.139 --> 01:13:45.472
I’ve seen parents who have doted on
their child, loved their child, this, that.

01:13:45.853 --> 01:13:49.523
Children mostly go astray.

01:13:52.264 --> 01:13:55.464
But if you have a detached love for your child,

01:13:56.054 --> 01:14:00.093
you do nice things for the child.

01:14:00.269 --> 01:14:07.069
At the same time, you know when to say ‘no’,
when it is not good. ” This I don’t like, don’t do it “,

01:14:07.554 --> 01:14:09.669
you must say that.

01:14:13.220 --> 01:14:16.573
But detachment is even wider than that.

01:14:18.617 --> 01:14:22.327
Like some people are very fond of food.

01:14:24.165 --> 01:14:25.165
So,

01:14:27.280 --> 01:14:31.307
to say that you be detached from food is very difficult for them.

01:14:31.902 --> 01:14:36.418
Specially, at a certain age, I think, they are very fond of good

01:14:36.856 --> 01:14:41.688
food and all that. Gandhiji has talked about Aswad:

01:14:42.026 --> 01:14:44.093
you should not have any taste.

01:14:44.665 --> 01:14:49.732
But as you grow in Sahaja Yoga,
you’ll find automatically it will happen.

01:14:51.332 --> 01:14:54.465
All your fascination about food will drop out.

01:14:55.875 --> 01:15:00.275
That is another sign that you are absolutely detached about food.

01:15:00.690 --> 01:15:05.490
Now, today I had My lunch,
I don’t know whether it is dinner or lunch,

01:15:05.691 --> 01:15:07.813
’cause I had it at about five o’clock,

01:15:07.969 --> 01:15:10.903
so I don’t know wich part of the day it is.

01:15:11.048 --> 01:15:14.648
And if I don’t eat, it also makes no difference to Me,

01:15:16.048 --> 01:15:19.659
it doesn’t make Me weak or in any way unhappy.

01:15:22.373 --> 01:15:28.079
But thinking about food is just spoiling your brain.

01:15:29.035 --> 01:15:31.369
Many people just think about food.

01:15:31.551 --> 01:15:35.242
We went to their house: ” Oh, they had made such nice things.

01:15:35.342 --> 01:15:38.059
“We went to this house ” They’ve made such nice things.”

01:15:38.219 --> 01:15:42.067
What’s the use? You already have eaten, finished, now, done.

01:15:42.187 --> 01:15:44.720
Now, why are you thinking about that?

01:15:45.590 --> 01:15:50.323
Or: ” I went to somebody’s house,
they had given me a horrible food.

01:15:50.828 --> 01:15:54.161
” Why to think of food, I still don’t understand.

01:15:54.742 --> 01:15:57.142
Whatever has happened has happened.

01:15:57.305 --> 01:16:01.238
By thinking you cannot get back what you have been eating,

01:16:01.417 --> 01:16:03.417
or what you are going to eat.

01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:07.667
It’s there, whatever is there you have to eat, you see,
what can you do?

01:16:07.807 --> 01:16:12.191
For example, today, they asked Me:
”Mother, will you have hot dog?"

01:16:12.331 --> 01:16:16.669
In Hindi language it means real hot dog – means:

01:16:16.828 --> 01:16:19.943
garam kupte – they call that.

01:16:21.709 --> 01:16:24.109
I said ” All right, I’ll have it “.

01:16:24.269 --> 01:16:29.669
They said ” All the Americans eat. ”
” All right, I am an american, give Me “.

01:16:30.797 --> 01:16:35.937
But when you know something will not
do good for your teeth or something, you should not eat.

01:16:36.354 --> 01:16:39.906
For example, the beef is very bad for the teeth, very bad.

01:16:40.101 --> 01:16:42.871
That’s why you people loose your teeth very fast.

01:16:43.010 --> 01:16:48.319
Many people ask Me in the interview ”
Are your denture your own? ” I said: ” Of course, Mine “.

01:16:49.590 --> 01:16:51.590
They can’t believe it’s Mine.

01:16:52.685 --> 01:16:56.152
Because I know what not to eat for the teeth’s sake.

01:16:58.677 --> 01:17:01.911
But one should not be attached to an idea,

01:17:02.426 --> 01:17:04.739
that’s even subtler attachments.

01:17:04.879 --> 01:17:08.442
That has really killed this world with so many problems of

01:17:08.562 --> 01:17:12.065
fanaticism, racialism, I don’t know what.

01:17:13.569 --> 01:17:16.703
Now, here, see the contradictions people have:

01:17:16.987 --> 01:17:20.920
they go to the sea to get darker, and they have racialism.

01:17:22.185 --> 01:17:24.308
Why do you go to the sea?

01:17:24.724 --> 01:17:27.332
If you go to become darker,

01:17:27.473 --> 01:17:30.473
then why do you hate the people who are dark?

01:17:31.838 --> 01:17:36.532
Such a contradiction because the brain is not in balance.

01:17:36.987 --> 01:17:40.122
And for that you have racialism,

01:17:42.266 --> 01:17:43.734
you become racist.

01:17:44.707 --> 01:17:49.270
If not that, you have another conditioning that

01:17:49.449 --> 01:17:54.782
there are different casts and according to the cast,
you should go, in India.

01:17:55.622 --> 01:18:00.555
How can there be any cast when everybody
has the Spirit in their heart.

01:18:01.629 --> 01:18:06.696
They won’t eat from another lower cast,
they are higher cast, this, that.

01:18:07.760 --> 01:18:12.482
This brain is the one which creates all kinds of conditionings,

01:18:12.771 --> 01:18:16.303
and all those great Saints who have lived on this earth,

01:18:16.403 --> 01:18:19.339
wether they were in India or abroad or anywhere,

01:18:19.538 --> 01:18:24.339
all of them have stood against this nonsense of discrimination.

01:18:24.894 --> 01:18:28.326
That comes from brain, you know, ask them

01:18:28.466 --> 01:18:32.692
” Why do you think like that, you are higher than others? ”

01:18:32.890 --> 01:18:35.748
Like the germans think they are the highest race.

01:18:35.895 --> 01:18:38.367
Now, who will believe that bull story, I don’t know?

01:18:38.486 --> 01:18:40.708
It is absolutely nonsensical story:

01:18:40.828 --> 01:18:45.859
germans, the ones who have killed children in the gas chamber

01:18:45.999 --> 01:18:50.998
and enjoyed that, they must be the lowest race ever going!

01:18:53.181 --> 01:18:57.764
But they think they are the highest race! How can they be?

01:18:58.358 --> 01:19:01.445
Tomorrow, Rwanda people will say: ” We are the highest race,

01:19:01.566 --> 01:19:05.032
because we can kill each other nicely in the open. ”

01:19:08.253 --> 01:19:12.319
So, to think yourself to be higher than others,

01:19:12.479 --> 01:19:17.855
to think that you’re more beautiful than others, others are ugly

01:19:18.788 --> 01:19:24.833
– all this is the brain which takes you to ego,

01:19:26.441 --> 01:19:30.707
and the ego is the one who befools you completely all the time.

01:19:32.234 --> 01:19:34.301
That’s the job of Shri Krishna.

01:19:35.409 --> 01:19:38.276
The story you must have heard about Narada

01:19:38.405 --> 01:19:42.186
who never wanted to see, who thought he was a great man

01:19:42.302 --> 01:19:46.834
because he was never attracted to a woman,
and he was challenging even Shiva.

01:19:48.521 --> 01:19:52.854
Then Shri Krishna played a trick on him, He always plays tricks.

01:19:53.025 --> 01:19:58.660
He sent two Gandharvas to tease him.

01:19:59.214 --> 01:20:02.414
They went down and they asked Narada. They said

01:20:02.569 --> 01:20:05.951
” You are such a beautiful man, such a handsome person,

01:20:06.091 --> 01:20:09.681
there is a marriage going on of a lady [Rupoghadi, UNCLEAR]

01:20:09.836 --> 01:20:12.078
she is very beautiful, she is a princess

01:20:12.198 --> 01:20:15.610
and why don’t you go there, she’ll definitely marry you.

01:20:15.749 --> 01:20:20.749
” And they pampered his ego, you see,
such a lot, he started floating in the air.

01:20:20.908 --> 01:20:25.312
And he said ”All right, I am going to go there, I am so handsome.”

01:20:25.531 --> 01:20:32.347
Ego. He went there, and this princess came out with a garland.

01:20:32.525 --> 01:20:36.632
She looked at him and she giggled first and then she laughed aloud

01:20:36.836 --> 01:20:38.436
and then she went away.

01:20:39.351 --> 01:20:42.188
He couldn’t understand, looked at these two persons,

01:20:42.446 --> 01:20:47.823
they said ”It’s all right, now, it doesn’t matter,
maybe somebody is better looking, then you.”

01:20:48.339 --> 01:20:52.644
So, Narada was very angry, he went to the lake.

01:20:53.104 --> 01:20:56.970
When he looked into the lake, his face was like a monkey.

01:20:59.324 --> 01:21:03.946
He’s become a monkey because this ego makes you a monkey.

01:21:05.073 --> 01:21:10.697
And you start thinking: ah, you are great,
you are very beautiful, you are this thing, that thing…

01:21:10.837 --> 01:21:11.903
But you are not.

01:21:13.218 --> 01:21:15.684
Because if you are, you won’t think.

01:21:17.243 --> 01:21:24.043
Whatever you are, you don’t think about it. You don’t think:
”I am a human being“, do you say that?

01:21:24.187 --> 01:21:28.331
Or do you say ” I have no tails “, do you boast of that?

01:21:28.728 --> 01:21:32.252
Whatever you are not, then you boast: ” I am very beautiful,

01:21:32.451 --> 01:21:35.804
I am very good looking, others are ugly, this thing “.

01:21:35.923 --> 01:21:40.466
Then Shri Krishna plays a part through the Maya,

01:21:41.697 --> 01:21:45.230
and He gives a big lesson to that person.

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:48.602
It happens.

01:21:49.427 --> 01:21:53.256
So, never think that you are something great,

01:21:53.594 --> 01:21:57.660
or you have achieved this in life and achieved that in life,

01:21:59.606 --> 01:22:03.812
and that you are something a big Johnny.

01:22:04.466 --> 01:22:10.966
Nothing, it’s nothing but the ego that has moved on here

01:22:11.978 --> 01:22:14.778
and giving you these ideas, from the ego.

01:22:15.550 --> 01:22:17.950
And if you go even further with it,

01:22:18.089 --> 01:22:24.775
then Hitler may enter into your ego and you might behave like him.

01:22:25.252 --> 01:22:30.909
Or if you are conditioned, impossible to tell you anything.

01:22:31.187 --> 01:22:35.929
Like this Hari Rama fellow I told you
”Why do you wear dhoti in this cold weather?”

01:22:36.068 --> 01:22:39.115
He said ” My guru has told me to wear dhoti “.

01:22:39.282 --> 01:22:41.377
”So what sort of a guru is it,

01:22:41.496 --> 01:22:43.818
that he makes you feel cold. I mean, I am a Mother,

01:22:44.002 --> 01:22:45.964
I don’t like all this nonsense.”

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:48.560
He said ” No, but my guru has said “.

01:22:49.513 --> 01:22:53.143
What a conditioning! And conditioning

01:22:53.369 --> 01:22:58.321
for something which is absolutely absurd and ridiculous.

01:22:59.214 --> 01:23:04.134
Now see, Americans are most vulnerable to such a thing.

01:23:05.673 --> 01:23:07.866
You start any nonsense,

01:23:07.997 --> 01:23:11.444
immediately the Americans are the first to jump on it, immediately.

01:23:11.583 --> 01:23:17.555
Drugs you start, you start some sort of a,

01:23:18.402 --> 01:23:21.999
I can say, fancy dress.

01:23:22.714 --> 01:23:26.181
It will start in Paris but will be sold in America.

01:23:27.159 --> 01:23:30.959
Immediately. There are on the look-out of something new.

01:23:31.414 --> 01:23:34.681
It might be a monkey trick, but they will do it.

01:23:35.323 --> 01:23:41.592
I don’t know why Americans who are the residents of

01:23:41.752 --> 01:23:47.207
Shri Krishna’s land have no discretion at all,

01:23:48.220 --> 01:23:50.620
what to accept, what not to accept.

01:23:51.612 --> 01:23:55.552
They are the worst, they are worse than children even,

01:23:55.669 --> 01:23:59.759
there is no maturity of any kind: ” What’s wrong? ”

01:24:03.529 --> 01:24:09.175
So, the discretion which is the center we have here of Hamsa

01:24:09.553 --> 01:24:17.588
which is ruled by Vishuddhi, is completely sometimes blocked.

01:24:18.858 --> 01:24:23.600
Like one lady who came to America told Me very boastfully: ”

01:24:25.113 --> 01:24:28.716
Have you been to the pubs in England? ” I said ” No.

01:24:29.907 --> 01:24:34.867
Why? ” ” Oh, my God, what pubs you have here! You know,

01:24:35.085 --> 01:24:37.951
I went to the best ” I said ” Which one? ”

01:24:38.082 --> 01:24:41.653
“It’s known as Hermit’s pub ”

01:24:41.911 --> 01:24:46.891
” What is so special? ” Very high class lady, very high class

01:24:47.417 --> 01:24:50.432
– she says: ” You see, one man died,

01:24:50.611 --> 01:24:52.734
for one month nobody lifted the body,

01:24:52.853 --> 01:24:55.720
the whole thing was filled with the stink.

01:24:56.008 --> 01:24:57.741
So the stink is preserved

01:24:58.170 --> 01:25:01.345
and even the cowwebs are preserved as they are there.

01:25:01.564 --> 01:25:04.301
Such a great thing was this: in,

01:25:04.480 --> 01:25:09.480
when I went, and really I felt so spiritual there?

01:25:13.258 --> 01:25:16.774
” Then she started boasting ” You see, we are free people.

01:25:16.993 --> 01:25:21.794
I allow my children to drink. I give them drinks.

01:25:23.937 --> 01:25:28.404
” I said: ” Really? ” ” Yeah, I can give them any alcohol, anyone.

01:25:28.560 --> 01:25:32.131
I do not say ‘not this, not that’ – no, they can have “.

01:25:32.310 --> 01:25:36.444
The children who were hardly twelve and forteen years of age.

01:25:37.429 --> 01:25:41.751
I said ” All right, if you have been doing that,

01:25:42.208 --> 01:25:44.741
what can I say? You are a great lady,

01:25:44.906 --> 01:25:50.706
I would not do to my children or to my grandchildren,
but you are great, namaskar “.

01:25:51.057 --> 01:25:53.390
After three, four months, we heard

01:25:53.894 --> 01:25:57.148
that there was a birthday party of the younger boy

01:25:57.302 --> 01:26:01.890
and she had given all these alcohols to them for the friends.

01:26:03.453 --> 01:26:06.307
God knows what happened – they had candles and this and that

01:26:06.486 --> 01:26:13.609
– the whole house got burnt and all the children, her sons

01:26:13.867 --> 01:26:18.232
and these two sleeping upstairs, all got burnt and died.

01:26:23.451 --> 01:26:25.871
Boasting about nonsense,

01:26:26.824 --> 01:26:31.476
like: ” I have had five hundred men with me “.

01:26:32.290 --> 01:26:35.224
Another will say: ” I have so many women. ”

01:26:35.445 --> 01:26:42.131
I mean, you are stupid fools because you are organizing

01:26:42.509 --> 01:26:46.953
nice way to go to hell, and you are all going to go to hell,

01:26:47.310 --> 01:26:52.270
this is what it is to be told to them. If you go on like this,

01:26:52.528 --> 01:26:54.195
what will happen to you?

01:26:54.602 --> 01:26:57.802
Accumulating everything that will destroy them,

01:26:58.432 --> 01:27:03.165
doing everything that will destroy.
” Oh that’s good!” I said ” Why? ”

01:27:03.451 --> 01:27:10.197
” You know, if you take that, then in two minutes you go off. ”

01:27:10.376 --> 01:27:13.109
I said: ” To where? To hell, or where? “.

01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:20.147
Anything that is destructive,
I don’t know why the Americans should accept it,

01:27:20.287 --> 01:27:23.818
when they have Shri Krisna as their Lord.

01:27:27.370 --> 01:27:30.370
It is to be understood by Sahaja Yogis also,

01:27:30.902 --> 01:27:35.247
that you have to really transform
you have to serve to such an extent

01:27:35.406 --> 01:27:39.406
that what it is, whatever is destructive should be given up.

01:27:42.546 --> 01:27:44.045
First of all,

01:27:44.302 --> 01:27:48.169
I find some men and ladies with such long faces, you know.

01:27:50.224 --> 01:27:55.077
How can you be? You are living in the country of Leeladhara.

01:27:56.010 --> 01:27:58.677
He is the One who made everybody dance,

01:27:59.363 --> 01:28:04.680
and He is the One who sprayed Ras, Ra is energy, Dha is with

01:28:05.554 --> 01:28:09.950
– Ra-Dha. Ra is energy, the One who sustains energy.

01:28:10.367 --> 01:28:17.331
The One who did the mental energy enlightened and to sustain it,

01:28:17.649 --> 01:28:22.182
how can you people take to adharma,

01:28:22.520 --> 01:28:26.453
to immorality, and to destruction, I just can’t understand.

01:28:32.490 --> 01:28:36.776
I don’t know what are His plans are, very well,

01:28:37.422 --> 01:28:42.422
but He has to really save people of America from

01:28:42.562 --> 01:28:46.207
all kinds of nonsense they do morning till evening.

01:28:48.033 --> 01:28:52.100
There’s nobody who is sensible in the politics,

01:28:52.815 --> 01:28:58.310
nobody who has a good character at a very high positions,

01:28:58.502 --> 01:29:02.358
what sort of things! You cannot get one man

01:29:02.569 --> 01:29:07.302
whom you can say he is all right
and he will do good to your nation.

01:29:09.542 --> 01:29:12.142
Criticizing others, they are very good.

01:29:12.339 --> 01:29:15.339
Like we had this plague, this thing not much

01:29:15.475 --> 01:29:20.712
– this little bit came out,
they have published it all over these media,

01:29:21.129 --> 01:29:26.109
they’ve stopped all our ships,
stopped all our aeroplanes, made such a fuss,

01:29:26.248 --> 01:29:29.519
put us into so much trouble – what about your AIDS,

01:29:29.658 --> 01:29:32.325
which you are giving Prasad everywhere.

01:29:35.412 --> 01:29:42.157
It’s very surprising that with your brain
enlightened by Shri Krishna,

01:29:42.654 --> 01:29:46.364
how could people accept even mentally

01:29:46.721 --> 01:29:50.822
– person like Freud. How could you accept Freud?

01:29:51.220 --> 01:29:52.886
I just can’t understand.

01:29:54.374 --> 01:29:57.841
And now you are all ruined. So, now we are worried.

01:29:58.064 --> 01:30:00.802
They don’t what to do. Now they are breaking families,

01:30:00.922 --> 01:30:06.389
and all the logical conclusions
they reach is just the opposite of Shri Krishna.

01:30:06.627 --> 01:30:08.364
Like this Simpson killed his wife.

01:30:08.465 --> 01:30:11.341
All right, he killed, finished, this Simpson business.

01:30:11.529 --> 01:30:15.945
Now they are coming out big theories, see now: why psychologically

01:30:16.085 --> 01:30:18.885
he killed, because he was married to her.

01:30:19.239 --> 01:30:22.810
When you marry only you kill your wife or your husband.

01:30:22.990 --> 01:30:26.123
– So, you should not marry: what a conclusion!

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:30.420
Tomorrow they’ll say that people are killing each other,

01:30:30.569 --> 01:30:33.378
so allow them to have weapons in their hand.

01:30:33.478 --> 01:30:37.078
Now, they want to allow them to have some drugs also.

01:30:38.259 --> 01:30:42.459
Allow them to have homosexuality, allow them to have all this.

01:30:43.339 --> 01:30:47.842
Because, I think, these people in charge of affairs

01:30:48.100 --> 01:30:51.838
do not want anybody to live,

01:30:52.968 --> 01:30:55.782
think that ” Let them fight among themselves, do what they like,

01:30:55.904 --> 01:30:57.829
we should have our own seats. ”

01:30:57.985 --> 01:31:01.607
The way they are not worried about the immorality

01:31:01.787 --> 01:31:08.433
and all the destructive forces
that are acting on American children,

01:31:09.009 --> 01:31:15.318
american youth and american people, not bothered about them.

01:31:17.731 --> 01:31:29.774
So, tonight we are praising Shri Krishna who is Yogeshwara.

01:31:31.734 --> 01:31:36.634
He eats but He does not eat. He sleeps but He does not sleep.

01:31:38.358 --> 01:31:47.457
He has wives but He has no wife. Like this is the Yogeshwara,

01:31:47.855 --> 01:31:51.588
and that is what you are Yogis, and He is your Ishwara,

01:31:51.724 --> 01:31:54.057
so, you have to try to be like Him.

01:31:54.428 --> 01:31:59.440
Let your brain be enlightened by His blessings.

01:31:59.599 --> 01:32:04.266
And you’ll become that great personality
that encompasses everything,

01:32:05.274 --> 01:32:08.540
that sees everything, that gives you discretion,

01:32:09.102 --> 01:32:11.769
that makes you understand what’s wrong.

01:32:11.980 --> 01:32:18.035
And you feel enthousiastic about changing this America

01:32:18.392 --> 01:32:21.884
with all your efforts, with all the mind.

01:32:22.063 --> 01:32:24.820
That’s the most important thing you have to do.

01:32:25.035 --> 01:32:33.035
As it is, He is a Kubera, He is the Lord of Wealth

01:32:33.392 --> 01:32:35.805
and He has given you such a lot of

01:32:36.063 --> 01:32:38.930
wealth all around, you see, just very near

01:32:39.375 --> 01:32:42.775
New York, you should have such a beautiful places.

01:32:42.968 --> 01:32:46.856
In every way, you are blessed: you have money,

01:32:46.956 --> 01:32:49.489
you have everything, you have brains.

01:32:49.694 --> 01:32:52.894
Everything is there. What is lacking is wisdom,

01:32:55.369 --> 01:32:57.626
with everything, with you. Supposing,

01:32:58.321 --> 01:33:01.237
you have a car.

01:33:02.647 --> 01:33:08.035
You’re having a car, you have got keys,
you have got engine, you have brake,

01:33:08.169 --> 01:33:13.372
everything, but you don’t know how to drive, so what will happen?

01:33:16.236 --> 01:33:17.569
This is what it is.

01:33:18.161 --> 01:33:25.799
So, as Sahaja Yogis from America,
you have a very, very, very special responsibility,

01:33:26.732 --> 01:33:28.732
very special responsibility.

01:33:29.153 --> 01:33:34.019
Today we’ll be saying His hundred
and eight names which are well-done,

01:33:35.261 --> 01:33:37.528
have come from Poona all the way.

01:33:38.336 --> 01:33:44.566
So that we’ll have it first and then a little Puja of the Devi.

01:33:45.717 --> 01:33:47.403
May God bless you!
