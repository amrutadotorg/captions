1
00:00:02,990 --> 00:00:10,681
Yesterday’s experience was that
the whole day I had to spend it

2
00:00:10,706 --> 00:00:16,126
with police people explaining to them.

3
00:00:16,151 --> 00:00:23,725
And now I feel that in Maharashtra,
there is a rule of Mafia.

4
00:00:23,750 --> 00:00:31,872
And that it is for us to face it
and we have to prove it.

5
00:00:31,897 --> 00:00:35,190
I am sorry some people were hurt
so badly

6
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:38,080
and I'll think after Puja they’ll take
you to the hospital.

7
00:00:38,105 --> 00:00:43,751
Here there is a very nice hospital where
we have very good doctors.

8
00:00:43,776 --> 00:00:57,870
And then I would request you
to know that,

9
00:00:58,725 --> 00:01:07,788
the evil and the good, always has
to struggle and fight.

10
00:01:07,813 --> 00:01:17,146
Formerly in this great country of
Maharashtra all the saints were tortured,

11
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:24,451
to such an extent that it is amazing
how despite all that

12
00:01:24,475 --> 00:01:31,693
they kept the banner of spirituality
so high.

13
00:01:31,718 --> 00:01:41,865
They are still existing, the same people,

14
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:46,348
who have tortured the saints and I think
they are the same people

15
00:01:46,373 --> 00:01:53,573
who have behaved in such a bad manner
towards you all.

16
00:01:54,868 --> 00:02:03,139
This kind of ego-trip builds up
in everyone

17
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:07,185
– even in among sahaja yogis, it does
build up.

18
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:13,697
And they are all the time
on a different scene.

19
00:02:13,722 --> 00:02:22,992
This is like Hitler's style of behavior
that you pick up some sort of an issue.

20
00:02:23,017 --> 00:02:26,308
An issue could be anything, like they
are saying that

21
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:29,330
“we are trying to remove all the blind
faiths”. I mean,

22
00:02:29,355 --> 00:02:34,715
I've done this for eighteen years,
what can they do more than that?

23
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:38,147
And I have removed all your blind faiths
in all kinds of stupid things

24
00:02:38,172 --> 00:02:41,719
that the religion, so-called, was teaching
you.

25
00:02:41,744 --> 00:02:46,002
In every religion, there is no question
of only Hindu religion.

26
00:02:46,027 --> 00:02:48,628
But here they dare not say anything
about the Muslims

27
00:02:48,653 --> 00:02:51,460
because the Hindus are very mild people.

28
00:02:51,485 --> 00:02:55,306
They (the muslims) want that
all the temples must be removed,

29
00:02:55,331 --> 00:02:59,163
all the deities must be thrown away.

30
00:02:59,188 --> 00:03:05,410
This is all I think Rajneesh is their guru
because he made a...

31
00:03:06,797 --> 00:03:16,750
he made an exhibition where he tried
to show

32
00:03:16,775 --> 00:03:20,922
that Ganapati was something very funny
and all that.

33
00:03:20,947 --> 00:03:23,652
Now medically you know in Sahaja Yoga,

34
00:03:23,652 --> 00:03:28,895
that without Ganesha we cannot cure
many diseases. Is a fact.

35
00:03:28,920 --> 00:03:33,078
So a stupid fellow talking like that,
has become now the guru of these people

36
00:03:33,103 --> 00:03:36,651
who are discarded all over the world
and who have been insulted.

37
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:41,856
So these few newspapers have made
him as a guru, perhaps that

38
00:03:41,881 --> 00:03:46,210
they are following his methods of saying
that we should be,

39
00:03:46,235 --> 00:03:49,713
we should be rid of all these ideas
and this and that.

40
00:03:49,738 --> 00:03:57,130
But they have gone to the extent that
all the spirituality is an illusion.

41
00:03:58,495 --> 00:04:02,710
It's such a joke. And that we should
give up

42
00:04:02,735 --> 00:04:09,531
all the, all readings and all understanding
about spirituality.

43
00:04:09,531 --> 00:04:14,093
But they do not know that their heritage
is spirituality.

44
00:04:14,118 --> 00:04:17,556
And the whole world depends on that.

45
00:04:17,581 --> 00:04:22,049
The whole world, because when the people
took to industrial development,

46
00:04:22,074 --> 00:04:25,224
you know how far they have gone
and how much they are lost.

47
00:04:25,249 --> 00:04:29,062
And how far you were in that mess.
And how you came back

48
00:04:29,087 --> 00:04:31,844
because of Sahaja Yoga’s spirituality.

49
00:04:31,884 --> 00:04:39,652
Now if this nourishment from the roots
of spirituality

50
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:44,511
does not reach the West, the real
knowledge, as it is in Sahaja Yoga,

51
00:04:44,536 --> 00:04:49,325
the West will be finished. West will be
finished, you know that very well.

52
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:53,854
There is no joy, there is no love,
there is no poetry,

53
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:58,150
there is no music, there is no culture.

54
00:04:59,945 --> 00:05:06,130
But as you have understood that now
these people have now started

55
00:05:06,155 --> 00:05:09,046
talking about “no religion”
“no religion”,

56
00:05:09,071 --> 00:05:12,179
like many of your western countries
have also done,

57
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:14,682
specially Russia has done that way,

58
00:05:14,707 --> 00:05:17,626
that there is nothing like God,
there is nothing like this and that.

59
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,665
And now after all that now they
are coming to God.

60
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,059
So now we’ll have to go through
another circle.

61
00:05:25,084 --> 00:05:28,654
But they are only hardly twenty people.

62
00:05:28,679 --> 00:05:35,092
So even one fellow who is like Hitler,
can destroy the whole thing.

63
00:05:35,117 --> 00:05:41,466
This is a very important thing - to destroy
something you need only one person.

64
00:05:41,491 --> 00:05:49,734
But to sustain and to construct
you need many people.

65
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:56,824
To drown a ship, you need only
one hole in it.

66
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:02,995
But to build the ship, you take months
together.

67
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:07,177
So the work that is done for these
last eighteen years

68
00:06:07,202 --> 00:06:10,885
of Sahaja Yoga, is really tremendous.

69
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:14,085
And the truth about it, you know
for definite,

70
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:19,172
that it has helped so many people. Though
we have been going from ups and downs

71
00:06:19,197 --> 00:06:22,794
and all that, we've been doing wrong
things, no doubt about it,

72
00:06:22,819 --> 00:06:29,273
but still, now we are quite established
and we know what Sahaja Yoga is.

73
00:06:29,298 --> 00:06:36,484
The experience of Sahaja Yoga you all
have had. We have seen so many,

74
00:06:36,509 --> 00:06:40,510
(towards someone…) “What is she doing?
Please be seated”.

75
00:06:41,441 --> 00:06:46,016
Miraculous photographs you have seen,
so many miracles in your life day to day.

76
00:06:46,041 --> 00:06:51,239
Every day there are miracles. Now to say
there is no God

77
00:06:51,264 --> 00:06:55,205
is impossible for you because you have
felt the miracles

78
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:59,589
of this All-pervading Power,
the Paramchaitanya.

79
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:03,035
And also all the religions are explained

80
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:08,570
and the complete integration of them
has been brought in.

81
00:07:08,595 --> 00:07:14,033
But for that we have to know, as I told
you in Brahmapuri,

82
00:07:14,058 --> 00:07:18,506
that the sahaja yogis have to know that
they have to become dynamic.

83
00:07:18,531 --> 00:07:25,618
Whatever energies you have got, whatever
you have achieved within yourselves,

84
00:07:25,643 --> 00:07:30,718
is not sufficient enough. You have
to manifest.

85
00:07:30,743 --> 00:07:35,105
And in that dynamism, I think people
get lost.

86
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:38,458
I have seen that some leaders become
horrid.

87
00:07:38,483 --> 00:07:43,268
I mean, sometimes their Vishuddhis could
be horrible, then their heart goes out.

88
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:50,483
So you should not allow anybody (to be)
a leader for more than one month.

89
00:07:50,508 --> 00:07:55,685
It goes off. I have seen it. Because your
balloon has been already bloated

90
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:01,361
and again it gets re-bloated in no time.
(speaking in Marathi…).

91
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:11,466
They have religiously kept all the Indians
outside, I think. (speaking in Marathi…).

92
00:08:14,247 --> 00:08:17,397
I mean, he is the organizer here.

93
00:08:19,456 --> 00:08:22,723
(speaking Marathi)

94
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:30,720
So the heritage of our country is
spirituality.

95
00:08:33,099 --> 00:08:37,260
And this is the nourishment.

96
00:08:37,285 --> 00:08:46,539
Only the one-sided growth in the West, due
to machinery or whatever you may call it,

97
00:08:47,407 --> 00:08:51,333
has ruined it completely.

98
00:08:51,358 --> 00:08:54,625
And one-sided growth in this country,
and all such countries,

99
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:01,858
where religion has become a blind faith,
has also ruined it.

100
00:09:01,883 --> 00:09:06,646
But in the center lies Sahaja Yoga.

101
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:13,741
Now your wisdom, your sense,
is so apparent.

102
00:09:13,766 --> 00:09:19,517
I mean, people have been to all kinds
of gurus here and have been to everyone,

103
00:09:19,542 --> 00:09:23,988
but they don’t know anything about
anything. Except for remembering by heart

104
00:09:24,013 --> 00:09:28,384
- some these Hare Ramas, talk about,
“Rama” “Rama” – like that.

105
00:09:28,409 --> 00:09:31,339
While you know everything about Kundalini.
You know how to raise it.

106
00:09:31,364 --> 00:09:34,719
You know how to give Realization. You know
what are the diseases are caused,

107
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:38,836
how to cure it and everything and
everything and everything.

108
00:09:38,861 --> 00:09:44,923
I mean, it has come to such a stage
that nobody asks Me any questions.

109
00:09:47,301 --> 00:09:51,014
Otherwise, in the beginning in London,
My lecture was for five minutes

110
00:09:51,039 --> 00:09:56,571
and the questions were for the rest
of the time.

111
00:09:56,596 --> 00:10:01,202
So now you know so much.

112
00:10:03,651 --> 00:10:10,006
And you accept which cannot be explained
also, because you know that.

113
00:10:10,031 --> 00:10:15,084
For example, somebody will ask Me,
“Mother, how do you get these photographs?”

114
00:10:15,109 --> 00:10:18,683
Why are we talking about it?

115
00:10:18,708 --> 00:10:25,330
I know how it happens, who is doing
this trick. But I don’t want to tell you.

116
00:10:28,526 --> 00:10:30,680
Moreover, if you demand something,
I’ll never tell you.

117
00:10:30,705 --> 00:10:32,917
That’s one of the characters I have.

118
00:10:32,942 --> 00:10:37,965
Ah, if you come with humble thing
and honest desire to know,

119
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:40,894
then I can tell you about everything,
that you want to know.

120
00:10:40,919 --> 00:10:43,911
But if you just want to force Me and say
that, “I challenge you”,

121
00:10:43,936 --> 00:10:46,829
I said, “I also challenge you.
Get out of here”.

122
00:10:46,854 --> 00:10:49,995
Like that. You see, it doesn’t react,
that way.

123
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:56,248
So it is just the temperament
of the Divine

124
00:10:56,288 --> 00:11:03,212
that if you are convex, the Divine
becomes convex also,

125
00:11:03,237 --> 00:11:08,554
and fights and says, “No, get out”.
If you become concave,

126
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:17,114
then it emits and gives knowledge,
or receives knowledge.

127
00:11:17,139 --> 00:11:23,105
So one has to be humble. That’s very
important part of it. One has to be humble.

128
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:31,385
So the awareness, again I talk about
awareness,

129
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:36,457
within you should be that, how much
we have come to know about ourselves.

130
00:11:36,482 --> 00:11:39,936
How much we have to come to know
about others?

131
00:11:39,961 --> 00:11:47,555
How much we know about our own being?
How much we know about chakras?

132
00:11:47,580 --> 00:11:51,421
In such a short time, how did we come
to know about it?

133
00:11:51,446 --> 00:11:55,470
Like we should know, if you are dealing
with a computer,

134
00:11:55,495 --> 00:12:02,729
and you know how computer works, how
it acts, how it is programmed, everything

135
00:12:02,754 --> 00:12:08,669
without programming it, without working
it out, without building it up.

136
00:12:08,694 --> 00:12:11,946
I mean, if you build it up, you know
how it works. But without doing that

137
00:12:11,971 --> 00:12:16,018
just to know a computer how it works,
and all the machinery about it,

138
00:12:16,043 --> 00:12:19,642
is a tremendous knowledge.

139
00:12:19,667 --> 00:12:23,319
And this is what has to be there
for all of us

140
00:12:23,344 --> 00:12:27,515
to know what we are there as human beings,
and what we have to do

141
00:12:27,642 --> 00:12:32,605
to emancipate the other human beings.

142
00:12:33,195 --> 00:12:37,620
Of course, I shouldn’t say that every
sahaja yogi is of that level, no.

143
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:42,957
Or comes up, but everybody is trying.
Nobody has denied Sahaja Yoga.

144
00:12:42,982 --> 00:12:47,343
Nobody has said it’s not true. Everybody
is trying to get

145
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:53,744
higher and higher in his state
of spirituality which doesn’t speak.

146
00:12:53,769 --> 00:13:00,367
It acts. It doesn’t manipulate. It acts.

147
00:13:00,392 --> 00:13:04,816
And we've seen it acts in so many
miraculous ways.

148
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:10,434
So first to know about all these things,
after feeling that Paramchaitanya,

149
00:13:10,459 --> 00:13:14,711
is different from just to talk about it.

150
00:13:14,736 --> 00:13:18,817
Many have talked about it, but you have
never felt it.

151
00:13:18,842 --> 00:13:23,746
Now you have felt it, you have verified it,
you have experimented it.

152
00:13:23,771 --> 00:13:29,197
And you have found it that, this is
something absolutely real.

153
00:13:29,222 --> 00:13:37,661
In science, as Dr. Khan was telling Me,
that in science,

154
00:13:37,686 --> 00:13:44,335
the one theory which is established today
might be refuted tomorrow.

155
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:48,873
Another theory that is established,
may be refuted.

156
00:13:48,898 --> 00:13:53,101
It goes on. So that no theory is
an absolute theory.

157
00:13:53,126 --> 00:13:57,899
But in Sahaja Yoga for the last eighteen
years, whatever I have been saying

158
00:13:57,924 --> 00:14:04,160
is the truth. And is absolute. It cannot
be challenged again.

159
00:14:04,185 --> 00:14:07,539
Nobody can say, “No, Mother,
it is not so”.

160
00:14:07,564 --> 00:14:12,993
A simple thing is, somebody comes to you
and you say, the other day it happened,

161
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:19,481
one doctor was there in Aurangabad,
and he said that,

162
00:14:22,796 --> 00:14:28,023
“I have never had any guru”. But his left
Swadhistana…

163
00:14:28,048 --> 00:14:31,572
and he was looking very disturbed. He was
a sahaja yogi in a way,

164
00:14:31,597 --> 00:14:36,305
not looking normal. “I have pain
in the stomach,” and this and that.

165
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:41,778
I asked him, “You had no guru?”,
he said, “No”. (speaking Marathi).

166
00:15:55,784 --> 00:16:00,904
So now as science has progressed
we can see clearly

167
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,996
that it has not got the theory
which is absolute.

168
00:16:06,021 --> 00:16:11,873
But in Sahaja Yoga, as I told you,
there was a gentleman, a doctor,

169
00:16:11,898 --> 00:16:15,323
who was denying, he said, “I had no guru”.
I asked him, “Do you read books?”,

170
00:16:15,348 --> 00:16:21,613
“Yes – he said - I read Vivekananda”.
I said, “That’s it”.

171
00:16:21,638 --> 00:16:25,345
He said he was reading the book
of a particular guru.

172
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:30,855
We gave a bandhan to that guru
and this fellow felt alright.

173
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:37,569
There are so many things one has to know
about.

174
00:16:37,594 --> 00:16:45,279
Little, little things are there, which must
be understood in Sahaja Yoga.

175
00:16:45,304 --> 00:16:51,959
And one should do it according to them,
because it is for your benevolence.

176
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:59,752
Now supposing I say, “Just do these
things”. If you don’t accept Me,

177
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:03,429
why am I telling you? I am not telling you
because I have to gain anything.

178
00:17:03,454 --> 00:17:08,777
But is for your good. Now if you don’t
want to accept me or if you react,

179
00:17:08,802 --> 00:17:12,785
is not going to help you. Sahaja Yoga
is not for Me, is for you.

180
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:17,014
Now if you are, truthfully, honestly,
if you are seekers,

181
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:22,254
then you must know that "My aim
is to rise spiritually".

182
00:17:22,279 --> 00:17:24,955
Now in science you have risen quite a lot,
you are fed up with it.

183
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:27,974
Now you’re back into spirituality

184
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:31,747
and for spirituality you have to be
a subtler person.

185
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:36,119
And for these subtleties you have
to give up all your conditionings.

186
00:17:36,144 --> 00:17:40,077
All funny conditionings are to be given
and the worst that you have,

187
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:46,132
is the ego part. It just jumps up. I have
seen that appointing people leaders

188
00:17:46,165 --> 00:17:51,130
has been the greatest harmful thing
I have done to them.

189
00:17:51,155 --> 00:17:55,379
So many of them just got lost, because
they became leaders.

190
00:17:55,404 --> 00:18:00,348
I mean, a kind of a Hitler, enters
into them.

191
00:18:00,373 --> 00:18:03,597
So this is one of the worst conditionings
we have.

192
00:18:03,622 --> 00:18:10,289
We have to be very careful that we don’t
try to assert our ego on others.

193
00:18:10,314 --> 00:18:13,783
When we become leaders or a some position
is given to us,

194
00:18:13,808 --> 00:18:22,890
or ask something is to be achieved
through your authority.

195
00:18:22,915 --> 00:18:25,757
Only we have the authority of God.

196
00:18:25,782 --> 00:18:32,185
Unless and until we become humble
like that, nothing is going to flow.

197
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:39,113
You can see that, that the sea lies
the lowest in height.

198
00:18:39,138 --> 00:18:43,256
And all the rivers and everything flows
to the sea.

199
00:18:43,281 --> 00:18:47,729
And from the sea only rises the rain.

200
00:18:47,754 --> 00:18:53,293
Supposing sea was somewhere on top
of Himalayas,

201
00:18:53,318 --> 00:19:03,763
we would have been all living
in the Sahara desert.

202
00:19:04,569 --> 00:19:10,445
Is a very simple thing, is to be humble
- that’s first sign - is to be humble,

203
00:19:10,470 --> 00:19:19,412
is to be non-violent, because we depend
on the All-pervading Power.

204
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:24,418
It is a power which is completely
integrated within us.

205
00:19:24,443 --> 00:19:30,985
Only we are not the ones, we want
to be aware of it.

206
00:19:31,665 --> 00:19:36,428
So this ignorance, this blindness,
if it disappears from us,

207
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:41,574
that Divine Power will manifest.

208
00:19:41,599 --> 00:19:46,811
But our styles are so complicated.

209
00:19:46,836 --> 00:19:50,565
Sometimes I just don’t understand,

210
00:19:51,163 --> 00:19:56,728
why we have complicated ourselves
so much.

211
00:19:56,753 --> 00:20:03,350
I mean, look at the flowers, look at
the leaves; they are on a tree, supposing.

212
00:20:03,375 --> 00:20:09,629
Automatically they will open out
to the sun. Automatically.

213
00:20:09,654 --> 00:20:13,067
You don’t have to take a leaf towards
the sun, not at all.

214
00:20:13,092 --> 00:20:15,871
Automatically it opens out. You have
seen it every day.

215
00:20:15,896 --> 00:20:19,129
Automatically. Because it requires sun.

216
00:20:19,154 --> 00:20:25,366
Now you want to have spirit in yourself.
You want to get to spirit.

217
00:20:25,391 --> 00:20:30,552
So automatically you should, really
automatically, if that is your desire,

218
00:20:30,577 --> 00:20:38,592
you should, with your own desire only,
should get to the light of the spirit.

219
00:20:38,617 --> 00:20:46,339
And should grow in that spirit to know
that this is what you have to achieve.

220
00:20:48,825 --> 00:20:52,329
But small things disturb you,

221
00:20:52,354 --> 00:20:56,711
like somebody doesn’t get married. Next
day you see the face of that person,

222
00:20:56,736 --> 00:21:01,833
as if somebody has died in the family
he is sitting there.

223
00:21:01,861 --> 00:21:08,876
Really, I have seen it. Immediately I make
out who has not been yet engaged.

224
00:21:11,197 --> 00:21:15,852
Then after marriage I find again
the same sort of nonsense.

225
00:21:15,877 --> 00:21:21,204
Because they are analyzing, “I want
this kind, I want that kind. I want”.

226
00:21:21,229 --> 00:21:26,435
I mean, whatever is available here
is available.

227
00:21:30,629 --> 00:21:36,583
Like on the ship, you don’t have any
problems, because you have no solutions.

228
00:21:36,608 --> 00:21:39,026
If you are moving on a ship and you
just ask for something,

229
00:21:39,051 --> 00:21:43,266
“Oh no, not available here,” finished.

230
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:51,244
But then you lose all the fun of Sahaja
Yoga for a small little nonsensical thing.

231
00:21:51,269 --> 00:21:56,905
If not this, next year. What is
so important?

232
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:03,357
I mean, certain there are limitations
of age, height, this, that.

233
00:22:03,382 --> 00:22:08,205
Then even if you arrange their marriages,
is very interesting,

234
00:22:08,230 --> 00:22:11,060
then they come and tell you, “No, no,
I would not like to marry this girl”.

235
00:22:11,085 --> 00:22:14,058
Why? “Because I want such and such”.
All right, then we find.

236
00:22:14,083 --> 00:22:16,995
“No, no, no, she is no good. She has
these things,” so move that.

237
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,583
I mean this is not the way. You are not
here to choose a girl for yourself.

238
00:22:21,608 --> 00:22:25,431
Then there is another one who can say,
“All right, I came down, I saw one girl

239
00:22:25,456 --> 00:22:32,369
and fell in love”. So you fall in love
and get out. This nonsense going on.

240
00:22:32,394 --> 00:22:39,202
See, you must have certain amount
of dignity. You are all sahaja yogis.

241
00:22:39,234 --> 00:22:42,304
And when I see all this kind
of stupid attitude,

242
00:22:42,329 --> 00:22:47,744
I say these people can never gain
in Sahaja Yoga.

243
00:22:48,709 --> 00:22:54,433
In India you will be surprised. I mean,

244
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:59,953
even I was married to a man who was
from another, another place.

245
00:22:59,978 --> 00:23:04,652
Absolutely different country, different
religion, different everything.

246
00:23:04,677 --> 00:23:06,810
And a different person.

247
00:23:06,835 --> 00:23:11,268
So one can say that it was a very
unconventional marriage, one can say.

248
00:23:11,293 --> 00:23:17,171
But I would never touch this man
or he would never touch me.

249
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:21,863
And if he would talk to me,
in the presence of others only.

250
00:23:23,184 --> 00:23:28,224
And despite that, our marriage is very
strong and we are very happy couple.

251
00:23:28,249 --> 00:23:31,008
With all these nonsense you go on doing,
bringing it to the level

252
00:23:31,033 --> 00:23:34,753
of physical appearances, physical
understanding, your ego,

253
00:23:34,778 --> 00:23:40,354
“I want this, I want that”, you find that
just after the marriage you get off.

254
00:23:40,379 --> 00:23:43,406
You start analyzing. That’s why
I am telling you today.

255
00:23:43,431 --> 00:23:48,982
I may not able to talk to you about
marriages later on. That be careful.

256
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:53,240
And that’s how you have brought
problems to Me.

257
00:23:54,523 --> 00:23:58,484
You see, once you accept that in Sahaja
Yoga you are going to marry,

258
00:23:58,509 --> 00:24:02,473
then you must accept that Sahaja Yoga
has its own norms and styles

259
00:24:02,498 --> 00:24:07,447
by which it will marry you and will look
after your marriage and will bless you.

260
00:24:07,472 --> 00:24:12,040
But if you start analyzing
and misbehaving,

261
00:24:12,065 --> 00:24:16,084
it’s not going to work out, and you
will have lots of problems.

262
00:24:16,109 --> 00:24:23,570
Either you believe in the All-pervading
Power and surrender your ego to it,

263
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:28,081
or else you have your ego.

264
00:24:30,676 --> 00:24:35,349
Sahaja Yoga is decided by Me,
by Paramchaitanya.

265
00:24:35,374 --> 00:24:42,870
Now sometimes in Sahaja Yoga it may
happen that, maybe, it may not work out.

266
00:24:42,895 --> 00:24:51,376
But invariably I have seen, invariably,
is none of My faults. None of My faults.

267
00:24:51,401 --> 00:24:54,925
Mostly the leaders have given wrong
information,

268
00:24:54,950 --> 00:25:00,061
mostly the leaders didn’t talk about
the, about the background.

269
00:25:00,086 --> 00:25:10,378
Or maybe that there has been some sort
of an ego-trip with the people,

270
00:25:10,403 --> 00:25:14,830
and they are the ones who are creating
problems for us.

271
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:20,798
But things work out. Slowly, gradually
we can improve. We must have patience.

272
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:25,053
If only on first day you start demanding
something doing that,

273
00:25:25,078 --> 00:25:28,651
it’s not going to work out.

274
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:35,555
We must learn to give, in marriage
it’s an adjustment of giving.

275
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:39,899
It is no adjustment of demand.

276
00:25:40,532 --> 00:25:44,995
We have to give. We have to sacrifice.

277
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:49,960
What is there with you to sacrifice is
all these rubbish things.

278
00:25:49,985 --> 00:25:54,103
Your spirit you cannot sacrifice,
so you keep to your spirit.

279
00:25:54,128 --> 00:25:57,816
And live with it. What is you going
to sacrifice?

280
00:25:57,841 --> 00:26:01,600
I mean, what do you have to give?

281
00:26:02,468 --> 00:26:06,435
And then only you will enjoy.

282
00:26:07,483 --> 00:26:15,416
Then only you will enjoy the spirit.
I am getting cool breeze from you.

283
00:26:17,191 --> 00:26:25,384
So I want you to be very great sahaja
yogis, very great.

284
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:31,974
And you should really manifest
your powers of wisdom.

285
00:26:31,999 --> 00:26:35,281
Now men have ego part and women
have another side,

286
00:26:35,306 --> 00:26:39,479
is that they are very dull sometimes.
Extremely dull.

287
00:26:39,504 --> 00:26:45,461
They don’t think they have to play a very
dynamic role, while they are the shaktis.

288
00:26:45,486 --> 00:26:50,564
Like they will not even clap hands,
they will not even have their torches

289
00:26:50,589 --> 00:26:56,974
to see what’s happening. Nothing. They just
think they are just a, sort of parasites.

290
00:26:56,999 --> 00:27:02,299
Just coming here as wives or sisters,
or whatever it is, wearing saris.

291
00:27:02,324 --> 00:27:06,612
No, you have to be extremely dynamic.

292
00:27:06,637 --> 00:27:10,471
You must know all about Sahaja Yoga.
You must know all about chakras.

293
00:27:10,496 --> 00:27:15,116
You should know everything. In India,
when in the ancient times,

294
00:27:15,141 --> 00:27:18,737
they used to teach them about God,
religion and all that.

295
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:23,480
So many great ladies we had, Gargi
and Maitreyi and all those,

296
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:27,089
who were very learned women.

297
00:27:27,114 --> 00:27:32,924
So in no way you should be just women who
do not know anything of Sahaja Yoga.

298
00:27:32,949 --> 00:27:36,782
Sahaja Yoga is not only meant for men;
it’s meant for you, much more for you.

299
00:27:36,807 --> 00:27:42,112
Because you are shakti and I am your
Mother. So I find the women lack that.

300
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:45,928
They are more worried about the saris,
the this and that, and I mean,

301
00:27:45,953 --> 00:27:52,180
now from the hair-dressing they have
come to saris. That’s what I feel.

302
00:27:53,462 --> 00:27:56,831
Well, it’s just the same.

303
00:27:58,951 --> 00:28:02,252
Of course sari is a very good dress.
It’s nice to wear.

304
00:28:02,277 --> 00:28:05,862
By that we give lot of encouragement
to our weavers in India.

305
00:28:05,887 --> 00:28:09,892
It’s very artistic, and good that
represents also

306
00:28:09,917 --> 00:28:16,060
a very lady-like feminine thing. But that
doesn’t mean you should become so feminine

307
00:28:16,085 --> 00:28:20,280
that you don’t understand Sahaja Yoga.

308
00:28:20,305 --> 00:28:27,259
I have seen women don’t know where
the centers are of the feet.

309
00:28:28,549 --> 00:28:33,915
Indian women know. Men do know….
Indian women know,

310
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:38,707
but the Western women don’t know,
so many of them.

311
00:28:38,732 --> 00:28:42,040
They don’t know about chakras. They don’t
know how to raise the Kundalini.

312
00:28:42,065 --> 00:28:44,339
They don’t know what’s the problem is.

313
00:28:44,364 --> 00:28:47,860
So once you have left that life, where
you are wearing a sari,

314
00:28:47,885 --> 00:28:52,890
doesn’t mean now that you have become
a woman in the gosha.

315
00:28:52,915 --> 00:28:56,962
Gosha is the one where they have to wear
chadar; chadar, they call it.

316
00:28:56,987 --> 00:29:02,022
No, sari means you can also be
very dynamic.

317
00:29:02,047 --> 00:29:06,610
The same sari that you are wearing,
even the saris of the nine yards,

318
00:29:06,635 --> 00:29:10,902
we have had queens who fought
the English.

319
00:29:10,927 --> 00:29:15,330
You have must heard about Jhansi Ki Rani.
She was hardly of any age.

320
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:20,152
She jumped from eighty feet height with
her child behind her. She was a widow.

321
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:25,932
And she fought the English. Left and right.
And when she was killed,

322
00:29:25,957 --> 00:29:32,151
the person who was here, the Englishman,
he said, the governor,

323
00:29:32,176 --> 00:29:38,796
he said, “We have won the war but
the glory goes to Jhansi ki Rani.”

324
00:29:39,977 --> 00:29:46,238
Then we had another one, Chand-bibi,
another lady, in a ...

325
00:29:48,590 --> 00:29:55,992
Ahmednagar; she fought. We had
so many women like that.

326
00:29:56,017 --> 00:30:00,670
Tremendous type of women we had,
though they lived like women.

327
00:30:00,695 --> 00:30:07,939
We had Padmini, we had Noorjahan,
we had Ahilyabai, so many women.

328
00:30:07,964 --> 00:30:12,625
They were not manly at all.
Very woman-like.

329
00:30:12,650 --> 00:30:17,867
There was the last one was Shivaji’s,
Shivaji’s daughter-in-law.

330
00:30:17,892 --> 00:30:20,707
She was only seventeen years of age,
seventeen years.

331
00:30:20,732 --> 00:30:25,026
And she fought this Aurangzeb and she
is the one who defeated him.

332
00:30:25,051 --> 00:30:29,166
Nobody could manage this Aurangzeb
horrible fellow, she defeated him.

333
00:30:29,191 --> 00:30:34,544
So though, you see, the Indian women look
so docile and simple,

334
00:30:34,569 --> 00:30:43,070
but when it comes to their personality,
they are capable of tremendous things.

335
00:30:46,563 --> 00:30:52,914
So this character when you are wearing
the saris you must also know how to tie up

336
00:30:52,939 --> 00:30:57,197
the backside and to fight.

337
00:30:59,254 --> 00:31:04,818
Otherwise you have not got the Sahaj
culture in you.

338
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:11,999
Either you are very dominating or you are
so docile like cabbages.

339
00:31:12,024 --> 00:31:19,752
You must understand that we have
to be alert, very alert.

340
00:31:19,777 --> 00:31:23,828
And Mother depends on us. On our own
personalities,

341
00:31:23,853 --> 00:31:28,222
that the way we are going to develop
ourselves, our children, our husbands,

342
00:31:28,247 --> 00:31:32,127
our society of Sahaja Yoga, the whole
of Vishwa Nirmal Dharma.

343
00:31:32,152 --> 00:31:36,744
Is the woman who makes the society.

344
00:31:37,361 --> 00:31:46,655
The whole universe is in the hands
of a woman who creates children.

345
00:31:47,617 --> 00:31:53,390
So the stupid ideas of romanticism
and all this nonsense,

346
00:31:53,415 --> 00:31:56,577
has to be finished. The possession
of husband –

347
00:31:56,602 --> 00:32:00,830
“What time you came,” “When did you go,”
“Where did you go,”

348
00:32:00,855 --> 00:32:04,696
and here the women when Shivaji
started his fight

349
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:11,633
they used to cut their finger, thumb,
and used to put the tika

350
00:32:11,658 --> 00:32:14,854
on the forehead of the husbands who
were going in the war

351
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:19,694
and they said, “Don’t come showing
your back”.

352
00:32:21,914 --> 00:32:24,733
Such great women we have had
in this Maharashtra,

353
00:32:24,758 --> 00:32:27,870
where you find them to be so mild.

354
00:32:27,895 --> 00:32:32,883
If it comes to their country, if it comes
to their own personality,

355
00:32:32,908 --> 00:32:39,749
to their own chastity or anything, they are
tremendous. Just like lionesses.

356
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:43,643
So with this sari lots of things go
hand in hand.

357
00:32:43,668 --> 00:32:46,991
Is not only the sari you are wearing,
but you are representing

358
00:32:47,016 --> 00:32:52,402
something very dynamic within
yourself.

359
00:32:54,340 --> 00:32:58,919
Now when we talk about our further
programs

360
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,390
people are insisting that we should have
a program in any case in Kolhapur.

361
00:33:03,415 --> 00:33:05,853
But I told them I’ll not allow sahaja yogis
to go there

362
00:33:05,878 --> 00:33:10,711
because they were hurt so badly. But some
of you can come, not all of you.

363
00:33:10,736 --> 00:33:13,889
I would be rather worried. I don’t think
anybody will hurt you

364
00:33:13,914 --> 00:33:16,785
and they are saying they will make
arrangements.

365
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:22,888
So if you want to come, if you are
not afraid...

366
00:33:38,034 --> 00:33:43,457
But on one promise. That nobody is going
to beat anyone.

367
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:46,799
I am saying, “Don’t beat. Don’t beat”
and somebody heard, “Beat”.

368
00:33:46,824 --> 00:33:51,742
I mean, I mean, I have never heard such
sort of thing, when I am saying

369
00:33:51,767 --> 00:33:55,113
on the thing that, “Don’t beat.
Don’t beat,”

370
00:33:55,138 --> 00:33:59,078
then somebody hears that, “Beat them.
Beat them”.

371
00:33:59,892 --> 00:34:03,506
I just don’t understand how can
(that be).

372
00:34:03,531 --> 00:34:09,482
So you don’t have to, really, you don’t
have to beat anyone.

373
00:34:09,507 --> 00:34:12,797
There is no need. You know that
there is Paramchaitanya working.

374
00:34:12,822 --> 00:34:17,775
All this is also the work
of Paramchaitanya. In the afternoon,

375
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:21,901
Yogi Mahajan was discussing with Me
very seriously like a lawyer,

376
00:34:21,926 --> 00:34:26,032
saying that, “Mother we cannot form
a criminal case on them,

377
00:34:26,057 --> 00:34:33,746
because there is no evidence”. Afternoon.
And in the evening we have evidence now.

378
00:34:43,776 --> 00:34:48,263
And then they are writing in the other way
round, that they were beaten up

379
00:34:48,295 --> 00:34:52,905
and that you threw stones at them.
And none of them were injured.

380
00:34:52,930 --> 00:34:57,308
They must have been vibrated stones,
I think.

381
00:35:00,746 --> 00:35:06,677
How can you? They had no injuries. They
wrote it down they've no injuries.

382
00:35:06,702 --> 00:35:09,967
So there is no need for you to bother
about it.

383
00:35:09,992 --> 00:35:14,739
With all that there were at least more
than four hundred stones that came

384
00:35:14,764 --> 00:35:20,651
and only eighteen people got hurt. And
really seriously, I think, one or two.

385
00:35:20,676 --> 00:35:25,955
So there is nothing and I can cure
all of you, [you] know that very well.

386
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:41,574
On the whole, you see this country,
especially Maharashtra,

387
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,540
is so full of devotion to God.

388
00:35:45,565 --> 00:35:48,930
Like these things are not going to work
out. But they are very dangerous people

389
00:35:48,955 --> 00:35:55,091
like Hitler, you see, they start moving
about and giving some ideas and all that.

390
00:35:55,116 --> 00:35:59,252
So it is better to finish them at the time
when they are just prospering,

391
00:35:59,277 --> 00:36:04,018
as they call themselves Nirmulan,
is to remove the roots.

392
00:36:04,043 --> 00:36:09,264
So we have to do the Nirmulan
of Nirmulan.

393
00:36:09,289 --> 00:36:13,634
All right. So now today we'll have
the puja.

394
00:36:13,659 --> 00:36:21,717
Then after that if you want you can go
to Kolhapur for your purchase.

395
00:36:21,742 --> 00:36:25,558
But it starts, the shops starts quite late
and will keep quite late till eight

396
00:36:25,583 --> 00:36:30,628
and tomorrow the whole day is available
for you. So you can take your buses.

397
00:36:30,653 --> 00:36:36,038
You can go down there, and you can have
your purchase and all that,

398
00:36:36,063 --> 00:36:39,564
then come back here. Tomorrow also
you can do the same.

399
00:36:39,589 --> 00:36:45,699
Day after tomorrow, our Mr. Govind has
very kindly invited you all to his place,

400
00:36:45,724 --> 00:36:50,910
as it is he is an extremely generous man.
So,

401
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:04,435
and when I told him that, “You must
take money from Me”,

402
00:37:04,476 --> 00:37:07,136
he was just fighting with Me, “Mother,
give me this first chance.

403
00:37:07,161 --> 00:37:12,559
This is my great honor that…(speaking
Marathi and Hindi to someone)

404
00:37:16,679 --> 00:37:21,587
So… Let them come, if they want to come.”

405
00:37:28,614 --> 00:37:32,196
So then the program is that day
after tomorrow,

406
00:37:32,221 --> 00:37:37,179
after this thing he says it will be over
by 12:30 or one′o clock.

407
00:37:37,204 --> 00:37:41,581
So you will have tonight and tomorrow
full day for your shopping.

408
00:37:41,606 --> 00:37:45,123
But I think then you should not bother
more about shopping.

409
00:37:45,148 --> 00:37:47,705
Whatever you have to do, better finish
tomorrow.

410
00:37:47,730 --> 00:37:50,663
And then you have to come
to the program also.

411
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:54,441
Day after if you linger on then it will
be very difficult.

412
00:37:54,466 --> 00:38:00,316
So all of you should go there, have your
food, and then go to Ganapatipule.

413
00:38:00,341 --> 00:38:04,371
This is the program. So you reach
Ganapatipule in the evening.

414
00:38:04,396 --> 00:38:06,912
I hope it’s all clear to you.

415
00:38:06,937 --> 00:38:10,897
And whatever you want to buy, you have
to buy here. But I would say

416
00:38:10,922 --> 00:38:15,363
that some of you are really, really
do not know what is real silk is.

417
00:38:15,388 --> 00:38:18,420
And I've seen some people buying
something horrid.

418
00:38:18,445 --> 00:38:22,337
And very thin silk you should not buy
because it will last only for eight days.

419
00:38:22,362 --> 00:38:25,418
And then it will be finished. So don’t go
for cheap things.

420
00:38:25,443 --> 00:38:30,644
One sari which is good sari, silk sari,
is better than ten bad saris.

421
00:38:30,669 --> 00:38:35,022
Luckily now we have some saris that you
wanted for, the printed saris

422
00:38:35,047 --> 00:38:39,875
which I can give you in Ganapatipule.
Nice printed saris,

423
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:47,055
of the tassar and also silk. We’ll have
them there. You can all buy, there.

424
00:38:48,486 --> 00:38:51,045
Anything else?

425
00:38:51,624 --> 00:38:57,553
Because I don’t think I’ll meet you any
more perhaps till we go to Ganapatipule.

426
00:38:57,578 --> 00:39:02,805
Now also if you could get those
bhajan things, please buy.

427
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,656
I have given you presents twice. But you
never bring them on your tour

428
00:39:06,681 --> 00:39:12,226
and this time again, I don’t want to get
this kind of a thing. (Hindi).

429
00:39:12,251 --> 00:39:19,260
Just show them. Anything of this kind,
please get it. Is very important.

430
00:39:19,285 --> 00:39:24,686
I have given you twice as presents
but it’s very difficult every time

431
00:39:24,711 --> 00:39:30,887
to go to the shop and get it for you.
If you can get them please buy.

432
00:39:30,912 --> 00:39:37,101
Some of you should at least have them.
(speaking marathi to someone)

433
00:39:45,453 --> 00:39:49,538
He will organize, you better purchase.

434
00:39:56,218 --> 00:40:02,556
Now all the marriages practically have
been decided. One or two are left,

435
00:40:02,581 --> 00:40:07,833
which he has also adjusted. Now those who
were over age or something like that,

436
00:40:07,858 --> 00:40:10,428
we could not arrange their marriages.
Doesn’t matter.

437
00:40:10,453 --> 00:40:13,194
It may work out, it may not work out.
Doesn’t matter.

438
00:40:13,219 --> 00:40:17,570
After all, you are in Sahaja Yoga. I mean,
you are really married to Sahaja Yoga,

439
00:40:17,595 --> 00:40:22,085
that’s all. This is something sideways,
you see.

440
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:25,398
So don’t make very, your life
miserable,

441
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,920
so all the way you have come, to know
that you are not ...

442
00:40:28,945 --> 00:40:33,139
we have not been able to arrange
your marriage. It’s not proper.

443
00:40:33,164 --> 00:40:36,920
Just enjoy. Don’t miss the point.

444
00:40:36,945 --> 00:40:40,226
May God bless you.
