1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000
My engagement to my wedding, it took a few months.

2
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.640
So my engagement was in May and my wedding was in December.

3
00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.880
So during that time, there were certain things that happened like a church I'm about to

4
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.080
go to the house and I was living there and certain things happened.

5
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:38.800
So I would just very quickly relate the story from the beginning.

6
00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:48.200
And just to understand something about me, I can just say about getting my realization

7
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.840
first, which is going to be very brief.

8
00:00:51.840 --> 00:01:01.040
So I used to seek through books while studying literature, but actually it was Mother Earth

9
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.680
notebooks.

10
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:13.840
It was Mother Earth notebooks that gave me my spiritual awakening in 1975 in Poland.

11
00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.400
From being an atheist overnight, I felt the presence of God.

12
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.640
And from that moment, dramatic changes happened to my life.

13
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:35.080
I was able to come to London in 1977 after seven years of applying for my passport just

14
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.400
to leave the country.

15
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.200
And then I continued my seeking in London.

16
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:51.960
I went to various meditation groups and I was practicing Hatha Yoga as well until one

17
00:01:51.960 --> 00:02:03.840
day in 1980 in April, I arrived in Coxton Hall and I saw Shri Mataji for the first time.

18
00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.720
I had very strong experience during the meditation.

19
00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:17.120
To me, it was very obvious that I finally arrived at my destination.

20
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.560
Of course, because the personality of Shri Mataji was also very magnetic and it was just

21
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:29.520
impossible for me to do anything else except to follow her wherever she went.

22
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680
And she went to many places at the time because she was touring England.

23
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.120
So I used to just sometimes travel at the back of her car and we all did.

24
00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.240
I don't know how we fit it in that car because it was a Mercedes, but sometimes seven of

25
00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.200
us, eight of us were in the car.

26
00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.400
So the car was expanding.

27
00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:05.120
So three weeks after I arrived, three weeks after my realization, I arrived in Dawliski

28
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.800
Lashdam in London.

29
00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:15.120
And this was my first puja with Shri Mataji.

30
00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.200
And Shri Mataji asked me to decorate her feet and then I had to be in the heaven sitting

31
00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.200
on the floor for four hours.

32
00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.200
It was all getting dark.

33
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.280
I didn't know how long it was going to last, but it was four hours.

34
00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:40.160
And of course, after leaving the ashram, I felt like a new person, completely free, feeling

35
00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.360
free, very happy and secure.

36
00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:56.200
So I felt I was sort of under Shri Mataji's wing, as to speak, because I don't know why,

37
00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:03.040
but Shri Mataji knew that I was feeling quite insecure anyway, didn't want to go back to

38
00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:04.040
Poland.

39
00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:11.120
So Shri Mataji used to hug me and kiss me quite often on seeing me.

40
00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.180
I just took it for granted and I thought it was always going to be like this.

41
00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:25.880
And when it stopped, I was quite disappointed, but somebody told me that I was ready to mature.

42
00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:35.160
But anyway, so it was really nice.

43
00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:44.360
My first time in Sahaja Yoga, however, sometimes I could not understand the accents of the

44
00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:49.600
Yogis because there were so many varied accents.

45
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:57.280
And before I came, I used to spend most of my time with foreigners in London.

46
00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:05.040
So I could understand Shri Mataji's speeches very well, but I couldn't understand sometimes

47
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.520
the Yogis with their very strong accents.

48
00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:18.480
Sometimes it was very hard for me to communicate, but nevertheless, in a couple of weeks after

49
00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:23.960
the puja, Shri Mataji suggested that I get married.

50
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.120
There was a subtle reason for this, and I don't want to elaborate about it right now.

51
00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.680
I felt if I needed to marry, I would like to marry a good Yogi.

52
00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:46.360
I think it was me, not Pat, who was first asked by Shri Mataji about the marriage.

53
00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:50.640
So Shri Mataji said Pat was a very good person and she recommended him.

54
00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:58.140
So I said, yes, thank you very much.

55
00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.300
And I was wondering what will happen next.

56
00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:12.560
I saw Pat before at the ashram with his son, so I could feel this bond of love between

57
00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.560
both of them.

58
00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:22.020
And that was very perfect for me because I just thought I would have a family ready made.

59
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.620
However, things were not that straightforward because my future husband was clearly avoiding me.

60
00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:36.860
So I thought it was not such a good start after all.

61
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:46.820
I could see Yogis looking at me and whispering and meaningfully sort of giving me glances.

62
00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.540
So I thought something strange was really going on.

63
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:58.300
A week also passed and I had no idea what was supposed to happen.

64
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.060
We went with Shri Mataji to Hester's house in Hampstead.

65
00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:09.460
After I think it was a public program in friends meeting house in Hampstead.

66
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.460
So after the program, we stayed overnight.

67
00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.820
We can't hear you again, Gresha.

68
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.500
Alpana, I just wanted to remind you, have you put it on the speaker mode?

69
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:33.100
Resna will be on the main screen when you're recording.

70
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:38.900
So the view can be speaker mode.

71
00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:40.980
So shall I start again?

72
00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:41.980
No, no, it's OK.

73
00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:43.060
We're back a little bit.

74
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:44.460
We missed a couple of minutes.

75
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:45.940
Yes, just fine.

76
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.940
Yeah, please continue.

77
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:51.140
OK, so where was I?

78
00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:55.740
Ah, the pad was not communicating.

79
00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:59.980
And he left early in the morning on that day.

80
00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:07.740
And in Hester's house, there was a walking wardrobe.

81
00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:11.780
I don't know if anybody remembers that wardrobe.

82
00:08:11.780 --> 00:08:14.300
There was a walking wardrobe in the bedroom.

83
00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:24.380
And Shri Mataji called me into this wardrobe for a private conversation.

84
00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:29.420
She told me that with such marriages it's like this.

85
00:08:29.460 --> 00:08:33.060
There are 20 people in the room.

86
00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:40.140
And everyone wants a perfect match.

87
00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:47.380
So if everybody wants a perfect match, how is this possible?

88
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:51.540
Then mother asked me if I still agreed to marry Pat.

89
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:56.100
And of course, I said yes.

90
00:08:56.100 --> 00:09:00.660
We both left the walking wardrobe.

91
00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:06.420
And Shri Mataji announced the marriage as an engagement to begin with.

92
00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:19.540
And of course, I was wondering what Pat's reply would be because I don't know.

93
00:09:19.580 --> 00:09:27.540
Anyway, so Pat met me later on that day with a huge bunch of flowers smiling.

94
00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:33.100
And I thought, well, that was a good start.

95
00:09:33.100 --> 00:09:42.300
It is from him that I learn about the events of the past week and the reason why he was avoiding me.

96
00:09:42.340 --> 00:09:49.900
So he was not keen on the match as his previous marriage was 12 years before.

97
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:59.300
It was a real disaster and there was no his fault in the marriage.

98
00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:03.860
So it was not Shri Mataji who told him about the match.

99
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:10.980
It was Peter Pierce who was told by Shri Mataji to ask him.

100
00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:19.940
And Pat was caught by surprise and said, yes, of course, if mother wishes.

101
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.380
But he was too mind about it.

102
00:10:23.380 --> 00:10:25.940
He decided to meditate on it.

103
00:10:25.940 --> 00:10:33.700
And to his astonishment, he felt the right heart melting and the vibrations becoming really strong.

104
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.820
So he became keen.

105
00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:43.540
But there was another message from Shri Mataji cancelling the match.

106
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:50.340
As mother said, he was not spontaneous enough saying yes.

107
00:10:50.340 --> 00:10:53.740
Just imagine what a roller coaster.

108
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:57.740
He was devastated.

109
00:10:57.780 --> 00:11:00.300
He was devastated.

110
00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:11.500
And he was going for lonely walks pondering how many former matches he will have in Sahaja Yoga.

111
00:11:11.500 --> 00:11:20.580
He was writing letters to Shri Mataji saying if he wanted to get married, but if he was not spontaneous enough,

112
00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:24.980
it only meant he was caught by surprise.

113
00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:35.300
Until the morning of Shri Mataji's announcement, he did not know whether he was going to be married or not.

114
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.900
Unfortunately, that morning he left early for work.

115
00:11:38.900 --> 00:11:45.220
So he only found out from the phone call that I was matched, not he was matched.

116
00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:54.820
To whom he asked the person on the phone and the person said, I don't know, I couldn't hear.

117
00:11:55.660 --> 00:12:06.660
So, anyway, that was quite funny, the whole story, but this is of course not the end of it.

118
00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:11.220
Anyway, we seemed to get on very well.

119
00:12:11.220 --> 00:12:16.020
So he decided to introduce me to his parents and his son Kevin.

120
00:12:16.020 --> 00:12:23.540
He was quite confident that it would be all right for me to visit his parents,

121
00:12:23.540 --> 00:12:30.580
despite my English, I was always very self-conscious about my accent and my English,

122
00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:35.540
because I was for a short time in the country, I was very nervous.

123
00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:47.060
So I guess what happened on the day of the visit, I lost my voice.

124
00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.100
I couldn't say anything.

125
00:12:50.180 --> 00:13:02.420
I was thanking the Divine for solving the situation, and to this day I think it was my saving grace.

126
00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:11.460
Anyway, during the engagement I briefly lived in Hampstead, in Mrs. Gulani's place.

127
00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:16.980
I probably some of you remember Mrs. Gulani and Mr. Gulani.

128
00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:30.020
They were the owners of the famous Temple of All Fates, in which we had many weddings and marriages in Sahaja Yoga.

129
00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:35.940
It was actually a Hindu temple with huge plastic statue of Shridurga on the altar.

130
00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:46.100
Yes, you can see in some of the videos, we tried to get rid of the statue, but somehow

131
00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:51.060
we didn't want to upset Mrs. Gulani, so it remained there.

132
00:13:53.060 --> 00:14:01.460
So this was the venue where many, as I said, many pudas and marriages took place in the very beginning.

133
00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:10.340
And Mr. Gulani and the husband were very respectful to Shri Mataji, and sometimes they used to attend the pudas,

134
00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:13.460
though they were not really yogis or not dictating.

135
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:28.900
Anyway, I stayed at Mrs. Gulani's place for some time, but something amazing happened to us in London.

136
00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:37.620
It was around July when Cherchem Road was purchased by Linda Williams,

137
00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:42.580
and this was another miracle, as she said, she bought it having...

138
00:14:44.980 --> 00:14:55.460
The house was in need of renovation, and old lady was previously the owner of the house, and she hardly looked after it.

139
00:14:55.540 --> 00:15:09.700
So that was the situation, and it was great because it was the first ever ashram owned by a Sahaja yogi.

140
00:15:09.700 --> 00:15:17.620
It was our own. I was asked to move the shower tree afterwards, after it was bought.

141
00:15:18.340 --> 00:15:24.340
Linda, her husband, her daughter, and other yogis like Chaya and Regis,

142
00:15:25.220 --> 00:15:30.900
and Louis, Marcus, they were all living there. There were quite a lot of us living there.

143
00:15:32.340 --> 00:15:41.940
As Antua probably will remember, the place was not only needing repairs,

144
00:15:42.580 --> 00:15:49.780
it needed a lot of vibrational work because the vibrations were terrible.

145
00:15:51.940 --> 00:16:01.060
So we used to burn candles in every room, we went around with ajwan, we played mother's talks in every corner of the room.

146
00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:11.140
We had this, what you call this, tape recorders. We used to play talks in every room,

147
00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:20.900
and we said many mantras. I tried to take the negativity out through the window. How we did that?

148
00:16:20.900 --> 00:16:30.260
We had a left hand towards the room, and with the right hand out of the window we were taking the negativity.

149
00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:39.380
Actually it worked. I do recommend if you ever in trouble in places. So it was like this.

150
00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:49.540
She managed to vibrate lemons, chilies, coconuts, sugar, salt, honey, and giforas.

151
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:55.860
So we could use all these things to work on the vibrations.

152
00:16:57.300 --> 00:17:02.820
And of course we were meditating, but it was quite difficult sometimes to meditate there.

153
00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:10.580
But it was getting better, and because we were in the collective it was great.

154
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:17.460
However we tried to fix things, but whatever we mended,

155
00:17:19.780 --> 00:17:28.660
another thing used to fall apart. So it was actually like going a few steps upwards,

156
00:17:29.380 --> 00:17:38.180
a few and even more steps backwards. You have no idea. You are so lucky having the ashrams that you have now.

157
00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:49.140
It was, as it's been prophesized, it was the foundation establishing ruins,

158
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:59.860
because it was a ruin. And of course we were told Sher Shamraut was the foundation of the New Jerusalem.

159
00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:03.860
So despite the difficulties we were honored to be looking after it.

160
00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:12.740
Shrimad Arji was greeted at one point at the doorway when she came for the first time.

161
00:18:12.740 --> 00:18:21.220
And there was a small Shribu Midevi Puja offered to her on the doorstep. Later on the offerings

162
00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:30.180
were put under the stone in front of the house, and she met her and she established Shri Ganesha there.

163
00:18:31.780 --> 00:18:39.620
So Shri Ganesha was established, and also the first child was born there in August.

164
00:18:40.100 --> 00:18:49.460
And this was another story, because I remember Linda had contractions while Shrimad Arji was speaking to her on the phone.

165
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:56.100
And in the end Linda dared to say that she actually was having contractions,

166
00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:05.460
because the conversation was getting longer and longer. She said she was getting having contractions

167
00:19:05.460 --> 00:19:12.020
and she was just about to have a baby. Shrimad Arji said yes, she could feel the contractions

168
00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:21.060
and told Linda to call the ambulance. So interestingly the ambulance did not reach

169
00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:28.900
the Royal Free Hospital, which was on the other side of London. It stopped halfway

170
00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:39.300
and the baby was born in University College Hospital in central London.

171
00:19:40.820 --> 00:19:50.100
We stopped in emergency, because 10 minutes later Linda delivered a child, a boy child.

172
00:19:50.100 --> 00:20:02.500
So it was amazing, because I was present at the birth of the baby, and for me it was an amazing experience,

173
00:20:02.500 --> 00:20:08.740
as I was quite scared of having children on my own, thinking I'm not going to go through this.

174
00:20:09.460 --> 00:20:14.980
But after that it was so easy, so I just thought well that's not that scary.

175
00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:24.340
Anyway, so Linda's husband arrived much later at the hospital, because he went to Royal Free,

176
00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:32.020
where the baby was supposed to be delivered. Shrimad Arji named the boy Datatriya.

177
00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:43.700
Anyway, now the life in the ashram kept going on. We had one car in the ashram and it was Peter's yellow van,

178
00:20:44.580 --> 00:20:50.340
maybe somebody can remember that yellow van, which we use for

179
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:58.740
buying food in bulk and also buying flowers, lots of flowers in Covent Garden Market every week.

180
00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:06.900
Myself and Chaya were not working. Chaya was an Indian yogini, very old yogini,

181
00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:16.660
not very old at the time, but now, and we were not working, so we could we could spend all our time

182
00:21:18.340 --> 00:21:25.780
in very basic kitchen, maybe you remember it was on the second floor, and we were cooking trimmings,

183
00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:34.740
doing washing up all day, and entertaining guests who were visiting all the time to see the new ashram.

184
00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:42.740
And we were actually exhausted, so once when Shrimad Arji rang,

185
00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:53.060
and she asked me how it was all going, because I was quite new, I tried to say the truth, so I said

186
00:21:53.060 --> 00:22:01.220
well it's all fine but we're not getting much help, we just... and Shrimad Arji told me off.

187
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:08.980
She said you are creating a problem for me, you just sit down and watch it.

188
00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:17.620
So I did that and it became much better, because everything became...

189
00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.260
everybody started sharing the chores and everything became more collected.

190
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:37.380
Anyway, now I'm coming to the description how the room where the wedding was going to take place

191
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:44.900
was created. So this the extension which is part of the meditation room now was being built,

192
00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:52.900
and Shrimad Arji asked at one point, she asked the men to put down the concrete for the food,

193
00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:59.300
for the floor in the night. She said now you are putting down the concrete,

194
00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:06.340
and they worked all night using all kinds of strange lighting, I remember this happening,

195
00:23:07.780 --> 00:23:15.380
and it was actually very cold, it was also quite cold, so while all these preparations were going,

196
00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:23.540
on their way, Shrimad Arji called me one day and fixed the date of our wedding for the 5th of

197
00:23:23.540 --> 00:23:33.460
December. Well that was all great, but there wasn't a room to have the wedding in.

198
00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:43.300
For quite some time I was observing the building work not really progressing as fast as it should

199
00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:52.180
have for the wedding to take place. This was a very trying time to exercise my witnessing power,

200
00:23:54.260 --> 00:24:03.220
and I don't think I was doing very well. In the meantime one Irish girl who lived across the road

201
00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:11.460
and was coming to meditate with us fell in love with Mia, and on hearing about the upcoming

202
00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:22.580
wedding they both asked Shrimad Arji if they could get married too. Shrimad Arji was sort of

203
00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:30.580
agreeing but was not happy with me for being over enthusiastic about it and possibly

204
00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:38.900
encouraging it. I am not sure, but I think I was encouraging it because I wanted

205
00:24:38.900 --> 00:24:48.340
as many people to get married as possible. So yeah, unfortunately the marriage

206
00:24:49.380 --> 00:24:56.500
of Mia only lasted three weeks. When he left Sahachi Yoga and Mia decided that being single

207
00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:04.420
was the easiest and safest option for him. So it's better not to fix other people's marriages

208
00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:13.540
and yourselves. The time of my wedding was approaching but the roof was nowhere to be seen

209
00:25:14.580 --> 00:25:23.940
and the walls were not plastered at all. They were just bare bricks. Nothing was much happening

210
00:25:25.780 --> 00:25:31.940
and it was a cold December. I was thinking the wedding would not take place at all.

211
00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:42.820
One day I was quite depressed thinking

212
00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:53.620
there is no change in the building work, no roof to be seen and the place looked very miserable.

213
00:25:53.620 --> 00:26:04.820
Anyway, on the wedding day the yogis

214
00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:19.300
were not faced by anything. I saw them in the kitchen preparing food for the arriving guests.

215
00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:30.740
Close to tears I was getting ready at Wendy's place across the road. Most of us

216
00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:40.420
were concerned about shimataji coming to a freezing place with no roof and bare walls.

217
00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:51.380
After maybe a couple of hours a messenger from the ashram heralded the arrival of the roof.

218
00:26:53.700 --> 00:27:03.620
I was getting more hopeful. Still, went an hour later someone came to say it was beginning to look

219
00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:15.140
fantastic. I said I believe when I see it. Mind you I could not see many things very clearly as

220
00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:23.380
I decided not to wear my glasses and leave them behind. I didn't want to look, I didn't want to

221
00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:34.340
wear my glasses on the photograph, quite vain. Anyway, eventually some people guided us inside

222
00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:42.740
to what is now the meditation room. It was bright with carpets and saris hanging on the walls,

223
00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:50.580
temporary roof was also there and the smiling faces of yogis and the atmosphere

224
00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:59.300
were just electrifying. It was truly divine magic in the air, everything was transformed.

225
00:28:01.220 --> 00:28:12.660
Shimataji came with the Hindu priest who conducted the ceremony. Some guests there were not

226
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:22.820
yogis and interestingly shimataji was wearing dark glasses, maybe because of that, but you can see

227
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:31.460
on the photographs later. I don't think that shimataji spoke, there was no video or audio

228
00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:41.540
recording of it. It was sort of an Indian wedding with shimataji present very much there.

229
00:28:42.500 --> 00:28:49.380
Shimataji fixed the turban on Pat's head, you will see it in the photos, out of her sari

230
00:28:50.420 --> 00:29:00.740
and also we were both given saris by shimataji as a present, as well as blouses and petticoats.

231
00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:08.340
Shimataji thought of everything. Of course because I did not wear my glasses

232
00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:26.500
I could barely see where I was going, following my husband or he was following me, but going around

233
00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:33.860
the fire and trying to do the right things asked by the priest. It was all very new to me.

234
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:46.740
The whole ceremony was very moving as you can imagine. I could barely follow

235
00:29:50.180 --> 00:29:56.660
the fact that shimataji was just there looking after everything.

236
00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:05.540
Afterwards delicious food was served and the atmosphere was very jarring.

237
00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:12.900
I don't remember much about what happened later on and when shimataji departed

238
00:30:14.180 --> 00:30:18.740
we were receiving good wishes and presents. It was all very sweet.

239
00:30:21.700 --> 00:30:34.020
But finally it was time for us to leave. On our way back in the middle of London we noticed we were

240
00:30:34.020 --> 00:30:47.220
running out of petrol and we managed to drive to a petrol station that was unfortunately already closed.

241
00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:59.220
We had to leave our car there. We had our first argument about Pat not paying enough attention to details.

242
00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:11.380
I mean not making sure there was enough petrol and about who was going to catch the taxi.

243
00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:21.220
Those days without mobile phones we had to stand in the street in our Indian wedding outfits

244
00:31:22.420 --> 00:31:25.060
late at night to flag the taxi.

245
00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:35.780
Actually that was some distance from me so when the taxi stopped I got in and accidentally

246
00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:48.100
shut the door. The taxi zoomed off, a path running behind. It took me a minute to alert the taxi driver to stop.

247
00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:56.420
Then we had our second argument about me for a change not paying enough attention.

248
00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:09.300
So that's how it all started. We drove off wondering how is this going to work.

249
00:32:10.020 --> 00:32:19.220
And we both are quite different as you probably know, if not opposite personalities.

250
00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:27.940
And yet we have a very happy successful marriage based on love, respect, freedom to be ourselves.

251
00:32:29.060 --> 00:32:36.340
In Sahaja Yoga we grow together but not in each other's shadow. Mother's love

252
00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:44.980
which brought us together has created this unbreakable bond and it has been our guide

253
00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:53.780
and strength in good and sometimes difficult circumstances.

254
00:32:55.620 --> 00:33:03.940
Jai Shri Mataji, that's all I could say. That's a wonderful, wonderful story Gresham, that's beautiful.

255
00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:08.340
So I think we're going to look at some pictures now from your wedding, isn't it?

256
00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:12.820
Yes, so I'll share some pictures and then Caroline you can tell the program.

257
00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:17.780
And then after that I'll be asking Dr. Shakumar Misra has joined us, he's got up in the night

258
00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:22.500
especially to join us from India to tell his story. So after we've looked at Gresham's pictures

259
00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:30.900
I'll be asking him to share his story with us. I'll just get started with the sharing the

260
00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:38.340
pictures with which Gresham sent. Some of them are in duplicate but I have not changed anything

261
00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:43.620
and Gresham if you want to say something while I'm showing the pictures please go ahead.

262
00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.900
I'll start sharing.

263
00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.020
So we're both bowing to Shri Mataji's feet

264
00:33:54.020 --> 00:34:05.060
and this is Shri Mataji. He's just going to arrange a turban on Pat's head

265
00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:13.060
and that's she arranging the turban, making into a turban.

266
00:34:14.420 --> 00:34:18.020
Those days nothing was just ready-made, everything has to be.

267
00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:36.020
Okay so now we of course they are landing the brides, the bridegrooms and we do the same.

268
00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:47.780
And there is a fire as you can see about and you can see some people here like John

269
00:34:48.020 --> 00:34:53.140
Kingston there is a gill mate there in the corner as well.

270
00:34:57.140 --> 00:35:01.620
That's Pat, you can see all the expressions, different expressions

271
00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:08.740
and Pat was wearing glasses and that's me.

272
00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:13.540
How beautiful.

273
00:35:13.940 --> 00:35:20.900
I was not smiling because I was quite a bit nervous maybe.

274
00:35:33.780 --> 00:35:40.980
And now you can see that I think I don't know what we're doing with feeding

275
00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:47.060
ourselves or feeding each other. There is Dania behind me you see, you can't see her face but

276
00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:56.020
she's there. She took some of our she's there. This is Dania in between me and me

277
00:35:56.580 --> 00:36:01.780
and when she was a teenager I don't know how old she was maybe 15.

278
00:36:01.780 --> 00:36:13.700
And this is the priest you can see there, the Hindu but he was not he was it's funny because

279
00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:23.780
he was wearing actually a suit. He didn't come in the kurta pyjamas like normally one would do,

280
00:36:23.780 --> 00:36:25.300
so he was wearing a suit.

281
00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.100
There's some more photos.

282
00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:42.500
I am smiling now because it's all over now, can relax.

283
00:36:48.180 --> 00:36:51.460
Felicity there behind Pat when she was young.

284
00:36:53.780 --> 00:37:02.740
And there were all these balloons singing. You see this the backdrop was the

285
00:37:04.500 --> 00:37:10.580
the now it's the the door to the garden of the meditation room in Cherisham route.

286
00:37:10.580 --> 00:37:15.940
And so these balloons were there and they were all released.

287
00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:24.100
It was very sweet and of course the children have fun with the balloons.

288
00:37:29.220 --> 00:37:38.100
So we are all smiling now and it's very nice.

289
00:37:46.660 --> 00:37:47.540
Beautiful.

290
00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:59.620
That's wonderful. Wonderful. So Dr. Shakumar Misra can I ask you to

291
00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:08.100
open your microphone and your video and relate to us your story.

292
00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:26.100
So

293
00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:40.100
you can't talk.

294
00:38:45.940 --> 00:39:06.100
travelers

295
00:39:15.940 --> 00:39:35.580
I think he's left a message in the, on the chat, but I'm assuming that he can't open

296
00:39:35.580 --> 00:39:37.180
his mic for some reason.

297
00:39:37.900 --> 00:39:42.940
Shall I go ahead and share the video with?

298
00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:48.940
Oh, he can't talk because everybody's sleeping in his house.

299
00:39:49.260 --> 00:39:52.020
Oh, okay. Yes. What a pity.

300
00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:54.420
What a pity. Yes, please.

301
00:39:55.020 --> 00:40:03.620
Okay. So Grazna requested me to play a video. I think this is Grazna, if you can let us

302
00:40:03.620 --> 00:40:05.100
know a bit before I play it.

303
00:40:05.260 --> 00:40:19.060
Okay. So, so it was, wait a minute, I just, it was 1981. It was December 1981 in Chersham

304
00:40:19.060 --> 00:40:25.940
Road. You will, you will recognize where the, where the, the meetings from Chersham

305
00:40:25.940 --> 00:40:33.100
Road quite often on Zoom. And Shimataji was sitting in that place where there is an

306
00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:43.260
altar now. Okay, so you can, so Shimataji was giving presents to everyone. Actually,

307
00:40:43.260 --> 00:40:48.780
they were sort of like Christmas presents almost. And she was saying goodbye because

308
00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:55.060
she was going to India. Okay. And you can see, you can see, you can see, seven minutes,

309
00:40:55.220 --> 00:41:03.940
you can see all the yogis. And later on, so it was only short, short, she, she gave a

310
00:41:03.940 --> 00:41:10.700
speech before, but I just wanted to show the presents. Yeah. Okay. Okay. If you can start.

311
00:41:13.740 --> 00:41:21.820
For today's New Year, let us vow within ourselves that the selfishness or the self-centeredness

312
00:41:21.860 --> 00:41:27.060
of the small less in you is finished. Now the drop has become the ocean. Live like an

313
00:41:27.060 --> 00:41:34.060
ocean and like a lion. Don't roar at others. I mean generously and don't be afraid of

314
00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:40.780
anything. Everything is taken care of, but believe that everything is taken care of.

315
00:41:40.780 --> 00:41:45.100
Sometimes you might feel you are let down, sometimes you feel, oh, this should have happened.

316
00:41:45.100 --> 00:41:52.100
Do not desire for it. Whatever you do not desire is not correct, that's all. If the

317
00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:59.660
desire is correct and is deserving, it will happen, hundred percent. So all the best and

318
00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:11.380
the greatest cheers and happiness and joy. Feel your responsibility, understand each

319
00:42:11.420 --> 00:42:18.420
other and now going, tomorrow I'll be gone, so-called. Don't worry about anything else,

320
00:42:25.820 --> 00:42:31.140
but worry about the Sahaja Yoga that has to be established all over the world. Very great

321
00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:38.140
work one has done. Of course, I mean you can say with one has done as much as one can do,

322
00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:43.580
but you can't do much more. You can become really dynamite and you can do it. Try to

323
00:42:43.580 --> 00:42:50.580
think of ways and methods of doing it. May God bless you all.

324
00:42:52.900 --> 00:42:59.900
So now, with all this green and blues, should we start giving presents now? Who is going

325
00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:06.900
to give the presents? You have met them, no? Thank you very much. Can I take these out?

326
00:43:06.900 --> 00:43:13.900
Thank you. Now these presents are nothing but an expression of your mother's love,

327
00:43:13.900 --> 00:43:20.900
so don't worry, I should work. Now, that's enough. I'll tell you. Let's pass one by

328
00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:27.900
one. All right, is the name. What a small present for you. I think it's better that

329
00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:34.900
you open it and show. Very, very small present, you know. Open it. Now, you can see, you can

330
00:43:44.220 --> 00:43:51.220
see the whole thing. You can see the whole thing. You can see the whole thing. You can

331
00:43:57.900 --> 00:44:04.900
see the whole thing. I haven't given any special present to anyone because I can't

332
00:44:12.220 --> 00:44:19.220
do that, but I know whom to ask to give special. I'll give special sometimes later.

333
00:44:19.220 --> 00:44:26.220
Can I open for you? No, just show that. See that. Come along.

334
00:44:26.220 --> 00:44:33.220
Come along.

335
00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:03.980
ost speech

336
00:45:03.980 --> 00:45:07.980
Satsang with technologies

337
00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:14.980
Yogesvara dasapedha

338
00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:22.080
Samy area

339
00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:29.080
Come, come forward, you both have to take it.

340
00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:33.080
All right?

341
00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:37.080
So much significant.

342
00:45:38.080 --> 00:45:41.080
Thank you Mother, very pretty.

343
00:45:42.080 --> 00:45:43.080
Thank you Mother.

344
00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:45.080
Remember that, all right?

345
00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:47.080
Barbara.

346
00:45:48.080 --> 00:45:51.080
Barbara, I'm going to take it.

347
00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:56.080
I must say specially I'm very much impressed by the work she has done.

348
00:45:57.080 --> 00:46:02.080
I wish people could learn from her how to do this work of

349
00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.080
of going to what place you should say, the farthest place of Canada

350
00:46:10.080 --> 00:46:14.080
and make the people so much realize, you see, for her.

351
00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.080
This is special one I bought in Finland.

352
00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:25.080
You see, for them to elephant I didn't understand how they did it.

353
00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.080
They had done it.

354
00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:29.080
You got this.

355
00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.080
This is absolutely significant that the Finland people should make an elephant.

356
00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.080
That's what she's done.

357
00:46:38.080 --> 00:46:39.080
Courageous.

358
00:46:40.080 --> 00:46:41.080
Courageous.

359
00:46:41.080 --> 00:46:52.080
Now this is going to be three pronged attack.

360
00:46:53.080 --> 00:46:57.080
Three pronged attack.

361
00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.080
May God bless you.

362
00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:08.080
There's a, just see, there's a, what you call that, bull, smiling.

363
00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:09.080
See, smiling.

364
00:47:10.080 --> 00:47:11.080
Let's see that.

365
00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.080
Let's see that one.

366
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:15.080
It's fallen down here.

367
00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:17.080
What?

368
00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:20.080
It's fallen down here and then he's got it by smiling.

369
00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:28.080
All right, Shubhala.

370
00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.080
You see, some of the you are left out because of the

371
00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.080
hariyanshari I think so, for Bala something.

372
00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:43.080
Bala is good at uniting people together and inviting them to his house

373
00:47:44.080 --> 00:47:46.080
and for him to give them.

374
00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:50.080
Of course this means that sometimes he'll again have the pleasure

375
00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:52.080
of eating in his house again.

376
00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:57.080
These are the leaf of the

377
00:47:58.080 --> 00:47:59.080
Kuyakatya-sishtila.

378
00:48:00.080 --> 00:48:01.080
Baniya, huh?

379
00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:03.080
Kuyakatya?

380
00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:05.080
Banana, banana.

381
00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.080
Gresha.

382
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:09.080
This is Gresha, isn't it?

383
00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:16.080
Now, Mr. Kavreshna, who has not yet invited Me to her house

384
00:48:17.080 --> 00:48:21.080
and I hope she will invite Me sometime.

385
00:48:22.080 --> 00:48:25.080
Though if I may go, may not go, I don't know.

386
00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:30.080
But still I would say that this is for with the hope

387
00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:33.080
that she will invite Me to her house.

388
00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080
May God bless you.

389
00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:41.080
This is the thing again with the bowl and these plates.

390
00:48:42.080 --> 00:48:43.080
Like that.

391
00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.080
I mean, same thing.

392
00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:53.080
This one I have not been to the wheel place for eating

393
00:48:53.080 --> 00:48:54.080
so...

394
00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:06.080
We just saw Gresha getting her present.

395
00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:09.080
And is that all, Gresha?

396
00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.080
Should I play some more?

397
00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:13.080
Or I think you wanted only till this point.

398
00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:18.080
You're muted. Please unmute.

399
00:49:19.080 --> 00:49:20.080
I tell you what happened with that video.

400
00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.080
There are only two more people.

401
00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:29.080
One is Gavin after that and one is Chris Clark.

402
00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:34.080
And then suddenly the whole video gets scrambled.

403
00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:39.080
So there are two levels and you can't really see what's going on.

404
00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.080
And the whole video is like this.

405
00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:47.080
Right to the end of giving the presents, which is a shame.

406
00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:49.080
Really a shame.

407
00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:55.080
It's a shame that maybe one day our computer, our video,

408
00:49:56.080 --> 00:49:58.080
could do something about that video.

409
00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:01.080
So that's why I think this was...

410
00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.080
That's all we could see.

411
00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:07.080
But the whole evening was just like that.

412
00:50:08.080 --> 00:50:10.080
She was laughing all the time.

413
00:50:11.080 --> 00:50:15.080
Every present was, you know,

414
00:50:16.080 --> 00:50:19.080
she had just some funny comments about it.

415
00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:26.080
And you could see there, there was Patricia,

416
00:50:27.080 --> 00:50:29.080
there was also, who was there?

417
00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:31.080
Sara Stechel was there.

418
00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:34.080
We were all young girls, you know.

419
00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.080
So, yes.

420
00:50:39.080 --> 00:50:43.080
So some of us remember the old days because we were there.

421
00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:45.080
Antoinette, you were there also.

422
00:50:46.080 --> 00:50:47.080
Yeah.

423
00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.080
Antoinette, you have to unmute.

424
00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:52.080
I'm sorry.

425
00:50:55.080 --> 00:51:00.080
I saw, recognized a lot of faces, but I don't think I was there.

426
00:51:01.080 --> 00:51:02.080
You were not there?

427
00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:04.080
I don't think I was.

428
00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.080
Because I don't know, because the video was...

429
00:51:07.080 --> 00:51:08.080
Yeah, because they were just from UK,

430
00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.080
but sometimes people were from abroad.

431
00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:13.080
Yeah, no.

432
00:51:14.080 --> 00:51:16.080
The video was sort of like this, going like that, unfortunately.

433
00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:21.080
I came to Church Amrout at the Puja at the time, a bit later, yes,

434
00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.080
with Shri Mataji there, I do remember that.

435
00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.080
And I felt that the walls were actually elastic

436
00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:31.080
because there are so many people who were in that room

437
00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:36.080
and couldn't understand how it could hold so many people.

438
00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080
You see, how you go to Church Amrout,

439
00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.080
the meditation room is not that big.

440
00:51:42.080 --> 00:51:43.080
Yeah, exactly.

441
00:51:43.080 --> 00:51:47.080
I don't know how many of us used to think in that room.

442
00:51:48.080 --> 00:51:49.080
It was amazing.

443
00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.080
It was always like this with Shri Mataji.

444
00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.080
It was a different dimension to everything.

445
00:51:57.080 --> 00:52:01.080
It was very nice that you showed this, Greshene,

446
00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.080
because so often people don't realize,

447
00:52:05.080 --> 00:52:08.080
we just watch Mother's Talks and public programs

448
00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:15.080
and you don't get to see this very human, very beautiful, generous, laughing side.

449
00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.080
Shri Mataji would make jokes all the time, laugh things,

450
00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:24.080
and she had such a command and control over the whole atmosphere

451
00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.080
and our moods and our emotions.

452
00:52:28.080 --> 00:52:31.080
She could just change the mood of the room just like that,

453
00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.080
with some funny joke or something.

454
00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:39.080
It was always correct, according to the person.

455
00:52:40.080 --> 00:52:47.080
I still have the plates and I still welcome everybody to my house

456
00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:51.080
and I serve the meals from those plates.

457
00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:57.080
So, these presents were chosen specifically by Shri Mataji?

458
00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:02.080
I think they were brought from India.

459
00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:07.080
You see, this is special because my plates were like a leaf.

460
00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:11.080
There is a special thing. I should have brought it with me.

461
00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.080
It's important to understand the symbolism of the presents.

462
00:53:17.080 --> 00:53:21.080
Whenever Shri Mataji gave you a present, there was always a much deeper meaning behind it.

463
00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:27.080
The one I remember so vividly was the Guru Nanak Puja.

464
00:53:28.080 --> 00:53:29.080
I think it was 1980-81.

465
00:53:29.080 --> 00:53:32.080
Again in Hampstead at the All Temple Faiths.

466
00:53:33.080 --> 00:53:36.080
After this puja, Shri Mataji suddenly said,

467
00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.080
it's time for the gifts now.

468
00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:45.080
The young men brought in boxes of gifts and each gift was wrapped in a brown paper bag.

469
00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.080
So you couldn't see what was the gift at all.

470
00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.080
Shri Mataji would literally pick out one of these bags and say,

471
00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:57.080
this is for Patti, this is for so and so.

472
00:53:57.080 --> 00:53:59.080
That person would come up and get the gift.

473
00:54:00.080 --> 00:54:03.080
You'd see them coming, going back to their place, opening the bag.

474
00:54:04.080 --> 00:54:10.080
Each person would just kind of go, oh wow, each gift touched in some special place.

475
00:54:11.080 --> 00:54:14.080
One of the ladies, she said it was a bottle of perfume.

476
00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:20.080
She said, oh, this is because Mother is telling me that I must respect and love myself.

477
00:54:20.080 --> 00:54:29.080
It was just incredible to see how Shri Mataji knew each bag, what was in it, who it was for.

478
00:54:30.080 --> 00:54:32.080
We couldn't see at all. It was very sweet.

479
00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:36.080
But that was such a huge part of Shri Mataji, the generosity.

480
00:54:37.080 --> 00:54:39.080
This became a tradition.

481
00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:43.080
After pujas, especially in Kabbalah or the big pujas,

482
00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:52.080
so much of the puja money that was collected went to buying presents for all the hosting countries and the people who were hosting.

483
00:54:53.080 --> 00:55:02.080
I remember somebody coming back, having hosted an international puja from North America.

484
00:55:02.080 --> 00:55:16.080
She had been given gifts by Shri Mataji to bring back and distribute to the ladies in the country, in Canada and in North America, who hadn't been able to go.

485
00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:23.080
It was a very deep symbol.

486
00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:33.080
Shri Mataji really showed us how to be generous, how to be gracious, how to be generous, how to be a Lakshmi.

487
00:55:34.080 --> 00:55:37.080
It was very beautiful. It was a lovely, lovely day.

488
00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:44.080
I have also stories about perfume because you trigger this story, this memory.

489
00:55:45.080 --> 00:55:53.080
We were in Churchham Road. Have I got time to tell this little story?

490
00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:56.080
Yes, of course.

491
00:55:57.080 --> 00:56:05.080
We were at Churchham Road. I was following, obviously, Gresham with my family there for two years.

492
00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:16.080
One day, I remember there were little problems in the ashram, as it is. Sometimes it happens in collective life.

493
00:56:17.080 --> 00:56:24.080
We were not many there. We were there with Janet Ridley and her husband and my family with our five children.

494
00:56:25.080 --> 00:56:31.080
We already were seven there, which was occupying the whole last floor, top floor.

495
00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:43.080
Yes, the house was exactly a little bit more decorated than when Breschner was there.

496
00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:57.080
You made me so much smile, Breschner, because I do remember the bathroom without any heating and me bathing my children in our bedroom because it would have been far too cold for them.

497
00:56:57.080 --> 00:57:06.080
It was really a little bit of a tapasya to live in this ashram at the time.

498
00:57:07.080 --> 00:57:15.080
The kitchen was very basic, etc. The stairs were quite dangerous because some spindles were missing.

499
00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:22.080
It was early on. I just had my babies, but there were some things.

500
00:57:23.080 --> 00:57:33.080
Shrimataji knew, so she called us and she called me at the ashram with the phone, which was on the wall on the ground floor.

501
00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:39.080
She said, hello, Antoinette, this is Shrimataji here. I said, oh my God, Shrimataji.

502
00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:45.080
I said, I want to see you. Come and see me at my place.

503
00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:51.080
She was living then in an apartment near Victoria.

504
00:57:52.080 --> 00:57:59.080
I said, oh my God. I found somebody to look after the children, the babies then.

505
00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:13.080
I remember I was rummaging in my cupboard to match my tights to my skirt to look really nice in front of Shrimataji.

506
00:58:14.080 --> 00:58:21.080
I had a nice navy blue kind of three-quarter skirt, which was very elegant and then a top also elegant.

507
00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:26.080
But I took a little bit of time and then I said, oh my God, I don't want to be late.

508
00:58:27.080 --> 00:58:32.080
I really walked very fast to the tube station, which was Stockwell.

509
00:58:33.080 --> 00:58:38.080
There were only two stops. There was Stockwell and then another one. Then it was Victoria.

510
00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:44.080
I arrived there and I was a little bit out of breath arriving there.

511
00:58:44.080 --> 00:58:51.080
The servant opened the door and I was shown into the living room. I sat down.

512
00:58:52.080 --> 00:59:00.080
Shrimataji came in and I was a bit short of breath and I was so thirsty because of walking fast.

513
00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:05.080
Shrimataji looked at me with a kind of smile and she said,

514
00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:16.080
you don't need to match your tights to your skirt before coming to see me, but I have time to do a foot soak.

515
00:59:17.080 --> 00:59:19.080
She laughed and we laughed.

516
00:59:20.080 --> 00:59:25.080
At that point, she knew everything actually.

517
00:59:26.080 --> 00:59:32.080
I didn't even need to tell her the story of what was happening.

518
00:59:32.080 --> 00:59:41.080
Very sweetly, she said, see Antoinette, when there is a situation, I let it develop and grow.

519
00:59:42.080 --> 00:59:51.080
Then like a wave crashing onto the shore, I come forcefully with my vibrations.

520
00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:59.080
So there it was. You just need to witness. Then she sought everything out.

521
00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:07.080
Then she invited my husband and I for dinner with her in her dining room.

522
01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:16.080
I still remember some delicious mango wessel and she talked to us very sweetly, very kindly.

523
01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:25.080
Then she gave us a box, a little red box with four perfumes in it, Indian perfumes.

524
01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:38.080
I still have them. One is Mowbras, one is Kush, the green kind of perfume for Sri Ganesha, and the other one is Honey Circle.

525
01:00:39.080 --> 01:00:49.080
Actually, the other day I put some of the Honey Circle on her photograph and the vibration, the whiff of this perfume was wonderful.

526
01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:58.080
That's one of the stories of Churcham Road, but it relates to what Felicity said, so I wanted to tell you.

527
01:01:02.080 --> 01:01:05.080
That was beautiful, Antoinette, and well worth listening to.

528
01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:13.080
It's now five to nine, so I suggest that we bring this to a close now.

529
01:01:13.080 --> 01:01:19.080
Antoinette, we look forward to hearing some more stories about Churcham Road in January, hopefully.

530
01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:24.080
Okay, we'll see how it goes. Thank you very much.

531
01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:30.080
Thank you so much. Thank you. Alpana, you can stop the recording.

532
01:01:31.080 --> 01:01:33.080
Thank you.
