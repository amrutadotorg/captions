1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:12,490
Shri Mataji: You must put some heated butter
in the nose, all of you.

2
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,020
Sahaja Yogi: Inside?

3
00:00:14,020 --> 00:00:17,300
Shri Mataji: Inside, with a dropper, alright?

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:19,230
Heat butter and fill it up.

5
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,640
And then, when it is slightly warm, not very
warm, absolutely slightly warm, then put it

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,740
in your nose, very important, because the-
I don’t know in this country, people, it’s

7
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:35,750
a very simple thing to be done once in a while,
about say two or three days later or even

8
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:37,600
every day you do, doesn’t matter.

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,230
It’s like putting cream on your hands, you
see, because the cold weather also chaps inside

10
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:46,060
the lining of the nose.

11
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:54,380
And when you put this, it makes the nose smooth
and you don’t get troubles of it.

12
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:55,500
It’s very simple.

13
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:59,359
All of you should do, all the Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do.

14
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,480
There are so many things that a Sahaja Yogis
are supposed to do, one of them is this, that

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,610
try to keep you Hamsa Chakra alright.

16
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:10,470
By keeping your nose alright you are keeping
your Hamsa Chakra better.

17
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:16,670
So better use this simple method of heating
some ghee, we call it.

18
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:23,200
You see, you can prepare it, heat the butter,
keep it in a bottle with a dropper, and heat

19
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:31,380
it in the hot water and then put it in the
nose, just like that, in the night, before

20
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,380
sleeping.

21
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:33,740
Even in the ears, we must put olive oil.

22
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:37,460
It’s very important.

23
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:42,390
For the teeth also, you must take some salt,
put some olive oil and rub your gums.

24
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,649
With that, you won’t have to go to the dentist
anymore.

25
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,854
That’s the best, I’ve never been to a
dentist all my life, and I don’t want you

26
00:01:48,854 --> 00:01:51,380
to go to the dentist anymore.

27
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:58,680
So that’s a very good way of rubbing your
gums with vibrated salt and what you call

28
00:01:58,680 --> 00:01:59,880
the olive oil.

29
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,170
Also you must oil your heads, every Saturday,
with so much of oil, nicely, oil it, massage

30
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,510
your head and sleep off and next day, wash
up your hair.

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,290
You’ll feel very much better.

32
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:16,020
If any of you cannot give olive oil the best
is almond oil for the head.

33
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:17,670
You’ll keep very peaceful.

34
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:21,840
Specially your children, you must massage
them till they’re five years of age, every

35
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:28,060
night, when they go out to sleep in the night,
nicely very- before sleeping.

36
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:31,590
And then put some powder, clean it out, let
them sleep.

37
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:34,610
Then the children won’t be running and upset
and all that.

38
00:02:34,610 --> 00:02:37,420
They’ll become very quiet children, well-behaved
children.

39
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,030
Because you people don’t massage the children,
all their lives they are jumping.

40
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:46,250
And all their lives they are slightly violent,
you see, the nose must be smooth out.

41
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,989
It’s a very simple method and as you are
Realised people you’ll smooth them much

42
00:02:50,989 --> 00:02:51,989
more.

43
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:54,393
All these small, small things must be taken
care of, you see.

44
00:02:54,393 --> 00:03:00,590
Now if you have too much of cold, if you have
too much of cold, then you can mix up with

45
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:08,879
a bit of camphor, with oil, and put that in
the nose, little actually, not much, that

46
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,100
also is very good, that also smooth your cold
and puts you right.

47
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:17,450
This country has one big problem with Vishuddhi
chakra everywhere in the West, because of

48
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:18,450
the cold.

49
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:22,769
And in Sahaja Yoga it is compulsory that you
must wear an undershirt.

50
00:03:22,769 --> 00:03:25,490
It is compulsory.

51
00:03:25,490 --> 00:03:31,300
Whatever may be, it is hot, cold, in India
when it’s steaming hot, you must wear an

52
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:37,750
undershirt, because, when it is very hot you
start perspiring and that perspiration causes

53
00:03:37,750 --> 00:03:38,750
problems.

54
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:45,000
So, always wear an undershirt, whether you
are in a hot season or in a cold season.

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:48,299
That’s a compulsion for Sahaja Yogis that
they must wear.

56
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:55,040
And for all of them, also is compulsory that
they should always wear a muffler when they

57
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,849
go out in the winter time this is an important
thing.

58
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:04,939
And also put some cotton wool in the ears
as I put it.

59
00:04:04,939 --> 00:04:09,349
For your sake I’ve told you to put it cause
you are careless, so I look after you but

60
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:11,440
putting it to my ears like this.

61
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,760
You all should put it before going out.

62
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:19,829
And keep your head covered in the night, when
you sleep, cover your head with something

63
00:04:19,829 --> 00:04:20,829
and then sleep.

64
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:24,470
Because most of the time, your body is all
covered, but the head is not covered.

65
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:29,280
Because now you are Realised-souls and your
Sahastrara is weak, so you must look after

66
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,280
your Sahastrara.

67
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,530
Cover your head so that you won’t have any
problem.

68
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:37,840
Also you must verify what sort of a person
you are.

69
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,100
If you have a liver problem, you must get
a diet for that, which is here, people will

70
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:44,100
tell you.

71
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:48,570
If you are left sided person, if you have
left sided problems, then you must know about

72
00:04:48,570 --> 00:04:49,570
the diet that you have to take.

73
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:55,220
For example, a person who is a left sided
should not take carbohydrates at all, on the

74
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,360
contrary should eat proteins, in whatever
form it is possible.

75
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,280
In Sahaja Yoga you know we don’t believe
in vegetarianism or anything, but we do believe

76
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:10,390
that the muscles of bigger animals than us,
are not good for our teeth, or for our body

77
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:17,530
also because the structure of a muscular cell
of a bigger animal is much bigger than ours.

78
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:22,420
And that’s how they heat up, I mean, even
by mistake if I eat some beef, or anybody

79
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:28,730
ask me, the other day, my cheeks were swollen
up, so that’s why it happens, it is an automatic

80
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,730
reaction.

81
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:38,130
And we are not supposed to use plastics; in
our clothes, also try to avoid.

82
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,400
Some person, [?] plastic can be used but not
all the time plastics and nylons.

83
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,680
And also the food should not be eaten in plastics.

84
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,450
You can eat it in paper, paper is alright
because it is –what you call- is wood, it

85
00:05:52,450 --> 00:05:53,520
doesn’t matter.

86
00:05:53,520 --> 00:06:00,080
But you shouldn’t eat in plastic food, plactic
with fork and spoon of plastic and it’s

87
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,840
too much plastic in this country, be careful
because plastic is anti-God.

88
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,930
It is anti-human life, it is anti-biological
processes.

89
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,470
So avoid plastic as far as possible, be careful
on that.

90
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,630
Also don’t use, I mean, something out of
absolute plastic like, I’ve seen I wanted

91
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:25,670
to buy one pair of slippers for myself, I
couldn’t get one in the all of New-York.

92
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:28,050
Because I didn’t want a plastic.

93
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:32,310
And if you wear that then you develop all
kinds of skin problems and diseases, so be

94
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,780
careful on that.

95
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:36,930
There are so many other things we have to
be careful about.

96
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:41,600
And because we have found out that these things
are harmful, that’s why we have made it

97
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:44,330
compulsory that every one of you must be careful.

98
00:06:44,330 --> 00:06:50,660
Because now you have become the temple of
God and the temple of God should be healthy.

99
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:57,560
We don’t want tubercular patients to go
around as saints nobody is going to believe

100
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,560
them.

101
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,870
Sahaja Yogi: Can you just tell us about sugar.

102
00:07:01,870 --> 00:07:03,160
Shri Mataji: Ah.

103
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:09,250
Now there is another falsehood about- thank’s
God it’s now broken- that the sugar is against

104
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:11,150
our growth and all that.

105
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,530
Sugar is very important for attention, specially
people who suffer from liver.

106
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:19,930
For example, people who are thin, mostly,
suffer from liver trouble.

107
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:25,770
For them, sugar is so important, that if they
don’t take sugar, they’ll become like

108
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,420
the sugar cane which is, comes out of the
machine, pressing machine, you see.

109
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,600
They’d better take some sugar.

110
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,740
Sugar is very important for your liver!

111
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:41,710
Best carbohydrate is the white sugar, not
the red sugar; red sugar is not good because

112
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:44,300
it has got molasses, it’s very heating.

113
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,500
Some people have funny ideas here, also about
food.

114
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:53,800
Like, some of them believe, that if you eat
natural food- and once I got something from

115
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,750
natural store and I got diarrhoea for five
days!

116
00:07:56,750 --> 00:08:01,940
Because it was meant for animals not for human
beings.

117
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:07,830
Like some people eat, what you call them [Shri
Mataji speaks in Marathi] cotton seed.

118
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:10,600
Now cotton seeds we give only to animals.

119
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,600
I can’t believe it.

120
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:16,150
But I’ve seen in Switzerland, they give
cotton seed in the bread.

121
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:20,810
There was cotton seeds in the bread, one or
two is alright, but imagine [Shri Mataji speaks

122
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:23,590
in Hindi] – Laughs from Hindi speakers.

123
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,830
I mean it has to be given to buffalos only!

124
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,950
[Laughter] Like that, I was given a [inaudible]
You see, these are very strong things.

125
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:32,930
In the same way, very soft food is also not
good, we have to be in the centre in everything.

126
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:38,409
Don’t eat very raw food you see, like some
of the bread in France you know, even in England

127
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:42,210
we find, the bread cereals [inaudible] completely.

128
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:44,550
So that kind of a crispy stuff is not needed.

129
00:08:44,550 --> 00:08:51,650
It should be such that your gums are looked
after, there are delicate things, and have

130
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:54,630
food which is good for you.

131
00:08:54,630 --> 00:08:59,650
Don’t go with rationality, don’t go with
the fashion, but whatever is good for you

132
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:00,650
that should be done.

133
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:05,420
And you find out about yourself, what is your
temperament, what sort of a food will suit

134
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:08,590
you, and accordingly you should eat.

135
00:09:08,590 --> 00:09:13,770
Of course, everybody is free to do what they
like but we can only advise them that this

136
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:18,790
will suit you and you’ll find out it will
be very useful to all of you, it will help

137
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:19,790
you.

138
00:09:19,790 --> 00:09:23,780
For your hair growth, also you should get
vibrated oil and use it.

139
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:27,590
Now, you’ll be surprised that day, somebody
saw Warren and he said: “He is the same

140
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:28,590
fellow?

141
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:29,590
He looks much younger”.

142
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:30,730
So I said: “Yes”.

143
00:09:30,730 --> 00:09:34,910
he had a bald head from here to here like
that and now he’s grown hair.

144
00:09:34,910 --> 00:09:41,640
With proper care, you can have you hair quite
intact, for quite some time, if you look after

145
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:42,640
your hair.

146
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,540
But hair is very important is not so much
the look, but it’s Sahastrara.

147
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:54,780
And if you put oil in your Sahastrara every
week, you will have a smooth personality,

148
00:09:54,780 --> 00:10:03,000
a smooth behaviour, a smooth movement; you’ll
deal with other people in a gentle manner.

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,040
So this is very necessary.

150
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:09,070
In India we actually have a big masseur attached
to a family, you see, he’s a very hefty

151
00:10:09,070 --> 00:10:14,140
fellow, and he comes to masseur [massage]
the men, you see, and he just sits on their

152
00:10:14,140 --> 00:10:17,230
body and really finishes them off completely!

153
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:20,690
At the first shot, they’re dead!

154
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:26,510
Then he uses their body fully and pushes them
and sits on them rub them with one clap!

155
00:10:26,510 --> 00:10:30,210
You see, five, six of them will be jumping
on five, six people.

156
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:32,010
With clap, they’ll go round.

157
00:10:32,010 --> 00:10:34,850
By the time the second clap comes in, the
person is finished!

158
00:10:34,850 --> 00:10:36,860
That’s how, that’s how they manage.

159
00:10:36,860 --> 00:10:40,530
But there is no importance on massage in here,
you see.

160
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:43,860
And don’t ask a non Sahaja Yogi to massage
you, never.

161
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:50,490
Don’t allow anybody to touch you that way
because, you see, these people carry all bad

162
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,320
vibrations and you may suffer.

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:58,310
You must allow only the Realised souls to
massage you, if possible, or you yourself

164
00:10:58,310 --> 00:10:59,500
should massage yourself.

165
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:05,100
But don’t go to these masseurs and people
who are massaging all kind of people and they

166
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:07,550
might be giving you some troubles.

167
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:12,620
So one has to be very careful about certain
things and certain personal habits also which

168
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,620
we have discussed.

169
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:19,130
And you can ask Warren, he’ll tell you about
it, which are very important for Mooladhara

170
00:11:19,130 --> 00:11:23,220
and all those things, which must be followed,
whether you are in England, America, anywhere.

171
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:28,020
These must be followed to keep yourself clean
outside and inside.

172
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,380
Now if you have any question.

173
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,620
Sahaja Yogi: I was only wondering about the
kind of techniques that we should use when

174
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,790
massaging the children.

175
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:38,390
But I guess we can talk about that another
time.

176
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:43,520
Shri Mataji: I mean, anyway you use is alright,
but always, you put it upwards, you see?

177
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:48,980
The movement should be upwards, but use oil
otherwise you pull up, you pull up their hair.

178
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:52,410
So use oil to put it upwards.

179
00:11:52,410 --> 00:11:55,760
Sahaja Yogi: And don’t forget the Sahasrara.

180
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,150
Shri Mataji: Sahasrara, don’t forget.

181
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:02,960
Sahasrara you must put lot of oil on children.

182
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:10,920
Sahaja Yogi: Mother we’re gone need more
hairdressers, people who can cut hair, who

183
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:11,920
are Realised souls, cause they are touching
our Sahastrara while cutting.

184
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,920
Shri Mataji: Yes.

185
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:13,920
Otherwise you can grow, what’s the harm?

186
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,920
Sahaja Yogi: We can grow our hair Mother?

187
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:16,720
Shri Mataji: Yes here, up to here [below the
ears] you can grow and turn them round.

188
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:24,140
Shri Mataji: You see, you’ll look like a
philosopher, quite impressive.

189
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:30,290
Shri Mataji: But you should not be a funny
looking person.

190
00:12:30,290 --> 00:12:34,420
That’s one thing very important you see.

191
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:38,800
You have to, not to adopt some funny methods,
you see?

192
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,040
Like people have.

193
00:12:40,040 --> 00:12:45,090
Specially, nowadays, the fashion is to disable
your hair and keep them absolutely disabled,

194
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,720
there’s no need of doing-
Sahaja Yogi: The hair must be up there, over

195
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,720
the forehead.

196
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,720
Shri Mataji: Ah!

197
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,640
It should be keep back over the forehead,
don’t cover your forehead or your eyes,

198
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:56,640
never.

199
00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,330
Sahaja Yogis: Agnya chakra
Shri Mataji: Ah.

200
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:59,330
Agnya chakra.

201
00:12:59,330 --> 00:13:02,040
You must keep it open, you see, always open.

202
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:07,840
You must have a centre path if it’s possible,
but keep the forehead open, this is important.

203
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:12,070
You should keep the forehead open, it’s
very good for others you see, and don’t

204
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:14,279
cover your eyes with any hair.

205
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:19,460
Many people have a habit of allowing the hair
to come in the eyes and you’ll have [inaudible].

206
00:13:19,460 --> 00:13:24,180
Children also, never allow hair to come on
their eyes.

207
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:28,400
Then we have something for the eyes also,
what you call Netranjan, I don’t have now

208
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:33,270
anything, but it’s a very good, simple thing,
cots you nothing about- [Shri Mataji speaks

209
00:13:33,270 --> 00:13:35,020
aside] one cent of a dollar.

210
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:37,920
Sahaja Yogi: We have some, we can send them
tomorrow.

211
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,570
Shri Mataji: Alright, they have some, they’ll
give you, which is to be applied first very

212
00:13:42,570 --> 00:13:43,570
carefully.

213
00:13:43,570 --> 00:13:48,660
Because if you are not used to it, it will
a little bit burn and the tears will start

214
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:50,910
coming out of your eyes, it will clear your
eyes.

215
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:54,529
And you’ll be surprised, with that, if you
use it, you don’t develop these bags [dark

216
00:13:54,529 --> 00:13:55,650
circles] and things like that.

217
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,740
And the water flows out.

218
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,850
It’s a very simple thing.

219
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:07,500
And for soap also, try to use natural soaps,
better use, because here the soaps are such

220
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,470
that I don’t know what to say.

221
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:10,590
Sahaja Yogi: Paramolove Mother?

222
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:14,230
Paramolove, I think that is about the only
soap you can get here.

223
00:14:14,230 --> 00:14:27,761
Shri Mataji: Yes that is good, Paramolove
is good.

224
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:28,761
It’s very good.

225
00:14:28,761 --> 00:14:29,761
Gap in the video

226
00:14:29,761 --> 00:14:33,850
Shri Mataji: What to do, is to take a little
oil, and heat with some clove, Cloves.

227
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:35,680
Sahaja Yogi: Cloves?

228
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,510
Shri Mataji: Cloves.

229
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:47,080
And let the oil be a little bit cool down,
when it is quite cooled down, nor burning

230
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:51,220
out at all, but just warm, you can feel it,
then put it in the ears.

231
00:14:51,220 --> 00:14:52,760
Sahaja Yogini: Olive oil is better?

232
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,300
Shri Mataji: Olive oil is alright.

233
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:55,300
Gap in the video

234
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:00,650
Sahaja Yogi: Mother can you explain to us
the techniques of vibrated sugar and vibrated

235
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:05,690
salt, by giving vibrations, I don’t quite
understand you see…

236
00:15:05,690 --> 00:15:11,640
Shri Mataji: You see, because God has given
you vibrations, the power is flowing through

237
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,900
you now, the vibrations are there.

238
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:19,190
So whatever you get from outside is touched
by so many people, so many people have created

239
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:23,040
it and they have got a good mind or may be
something’s wrong with them, best thing

240
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,480
is to give them a bandhan before eating.

241
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:28,620
[Shri Mataji turns tree times her hand]
Any food you eat you must give it a bandhan

242
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:33,600
like this three times, so your vibrations
flow into the food and you get it sanctified.

243
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:39,550
Or else, you can also use your hands for eating
if you have washed your hands, then it’s

244
00:15:39,550 --> 00:15:40,550
alright.

245
00:15:40,550 --> 00:15:45,720
Or else, if you are taking the water, you
can just put your hands there, then it gets

246
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,050
vibrated, then drink it.

247
00:15:47,050 --> 00:15:51,080
Because, the thing is, the vibrations have
started flowing through your hands, but still

248
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,540
have not spread to your body fully.

249
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:57,180
You see my point?
