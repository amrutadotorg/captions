1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
She didn't say, I bow to the seekers of consciousness.

2
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:21.160
God is sat-chit ananda.

3
00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.680
Truth consciousness is lits.

4
00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:36.160
So, Truth is coming first.

5
00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:48.880
There is a reason, because it is the gate.

6
00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:54.280
So what is the Truth?

7
00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:03.080
Shri Mataji says, the Truth is that we are the Spirit.

8
00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.920
But there is a play in Sahaja Yoga.

9
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:16.400
Because on one hand, yes, we are the Spirit.

10
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.880
And on the other hand, we have to become the Spirit.

11
00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:31.800
Because we are still with our ego and our superior.

12
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:42.120
So, we need to desire the Truth.

13
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:53.520
And to desire the Truth about ourselves, we need to introspect.

14
00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.520
Because we are still human beings, and if we make mistakes,

15
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.200
with introspection we find out.

16
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:14.640
And this is our honesty towards ourselves.

17
00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:21.440
That we try to find our own mistakes.

18
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.840
Not the mistakes of others.

19
00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:29.680
So this is the Truth about ourselves.

20
00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.840
And the Truth about the others, how do we find it?

21
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:41.000
We find the Truth about others when we forgive.

22
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.200
Because when we forgive, it means we don't see the mistakes,

23
00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:56.560
because in truth they are something more than the mistakes that exist.

24
00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:02.960
In the Truth of the others, even if they make mistakes,

25
00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.640
they are more than the mistakes that they make.

26
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.480
So when we forgive, then we go to the Truth.

27
00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.680
It is still complicated, I will try to...

28
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.920
The truth is that when we find our truth,

29
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.920
we are the only one who can find it.

30
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:27.160
And when we find it, we can't find it.

31
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.440
So we find our truth on our axis.

32
00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:34.320
So we find our truth on our axis.

33
00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:38.320
On the axis of the universe.

34
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:44.680
Now, when Sri Rama worships Sri Shiva,

35
00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.320
it is very beautiful and it is very powerful.

36
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.920
When Sri Rama worships Sri Shiva,

37
00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.520
it is very precious and very beautiful.

38
00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.760
And I mention this because here you are the children of the son of Sri Rama.

39
00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:08.560
The Slav people.

40
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.720
And so when Sri Rama worships Sri Shiva,

41
00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.240
it means the entire world of action,

42
00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:26.600
the entire management of this universe is put at the feet of the Ishvara, of the Lord.

43
00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.920
And when Sri Vishnu is put at the feet of the Lord,

44
00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:37.120
it means that the whole world is put at the feet of the Lord.

45
00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.000
The whole world is put at the feet of the Lord,

46
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.240
because of the existence of the Lord.

47
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:50.320
So when we put our action at the feet of the Lord, we go to our axis.

48
00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.880
But there is something else that I want to tell you,

49
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:06.640
because I had a dream last night, my first night in Ukraine.

50
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:19.880
Because Sri Shiva also pays homage to Sri Vishnu.

51
00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.720
And I think it's important that we understand that here in Ukraine.

52
00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.720
Because your national symbol is the Trishula of Sri Shiva.

53
00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.400
Now I hope I can explain this, because it's the first time I am explaining this.

54
00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.440
So, one day Sri Mataji gave me a big correction.

55
00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:11.200
And a big patach.

56
00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:15.440
And a friend of mine went and asked Sri Mataji,

57
00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:21.600
Sri Mataji, why do you correct Grigore so strongly, because he loves you so much?

58
00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:35.200
And she said, but in this way they always loved me.

59
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:41.200
They have built mosques for me.

60
00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.880
They have built cathedrals for me.

61
00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.600
So she said, human beings have always loved God.

62
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:01.440
But what about loving each other?

63
00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:05.440
Now this is an important point we need to understand.

64
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:17.440
You see, some yogis felt that if they loved Sri Mataji so much, this was the core of their faith.

65
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:28.440
And then they are protected by that.

66
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:36.440
But to love Sri Mataji is not enough.

67
00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:44.440
Because once we understand who Sri Mataji is, we cannot help but love.

68
00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:55.440
Like the iron dust has no choice but go to the magnet.

69
00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.440
You see, Shiva gave boons to the rakshasas.

70
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.440
Because they loved Sri Shiva very much.

71
00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:23.440
And with the boons they had, they started dominating others.

72
00:08:23.440 --> 00:08:27.440
So when Sri Shiva wishes that we pay homage to Sri Vishnu,

73
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:41.440
it's because our love of the Divine is not complete if we are not in the love of the Divine.

74
00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:47.440
It's because our love of the Divine is not complete if we don't love each other.

75
00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:58.440
It's important to understand this in Kiev because the Ukrainians probably have been Shiva bhaktas.

76
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:03.440
So actually we all in this hall, we are Devi bhaktas. This is understood.

77
00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:14.440
So actually we all in this hall, we are Devi bhaktas. This is understood.

78
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:38.440
Okay, so if we understand that our love for God is to be global and need also to cover our love for ourselves, then?

79
00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:01.440
Then we should all desire unity.

80
00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:14.440
Because we are cells in the body of Shri Mataji and how long is the war of the cells going to go on if we don't unite and love each other?

81
00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:37.440
Sorry, I don't remember what I said.

82
00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:48.440
Okay, so now is the trick.

83
00:10:48.440 --> 00:11:10.440
Because understand this. If you would be in India in 1945, the British colonialists, they want a unity.

84
00:11:10.440 --> 00:11:32.440
And the one who broke unity was Gandhiji because he started the revolution for the independence of India.

85
00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:42.440
So unity is possible only in Dharma.

86
00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:54.440
And remember the beginning when we said I bow to the seekers of truth?

87
00:11:54.440 --> 00:12:10.440
The seekers of truth can only accept an authority which is just.

88
00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:21.440
This is the other thing that Shri Shiva wants from us.

89
00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:36.440
So to love Shri Mataji, to love God is not enough. We need to have Sahaja Dharma.

90
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:50.440
There were very big Sahaja Yogis in the beginning. They loved Shri Mataji very much. They were very capable.

91
00:12:50.440 --> 00:13:07.440
Today they are not in Sahaja Yoga either because they could not love each other or because they failed Dharma.

92
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:19.440
Now if you have one collectivity which is divided, that means there are two proofs.

93
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:26.440
How can you have two truths? Then everybody is confused.

94
00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:39.440
So what do we do? We go inside. We have vibrations. We have hamsa. We have enlightened consciousness.

95
00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:50.440
And also in Sahaja Yoga it is not forbidden to have common sense.

96
00:13:50.440 --> 00:14:00.440
Am I trying to take material advantages out of Sahaja Yoga?

97
00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:19.440
Am I trying to exploit Sahaja Yogis? Am I trying to speak ill of those who are not following me?

98
00:14:19.440 --> 00:14:31.440
If a leader do that, he is not inside Dharma. So we can forgive.

99
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:40.440
Then we cannot follow because Shri Baba to the seekers of truth.

100
00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:53.440
Not to the followers of ABCD. And this is what Christ also told us.

101
00:14:53.440 --> 00:15:02.440
If we all introspect and we look at our own failings,

102
00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:09.440
and if we forgive the others who make mistakes because we can all make mistakes,

103
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:15.440
then we will come out of confusion.

104
00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:26.440
And in any case it will be good for our meditation. So it is a win-win solution.

105
00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:40.440
How much time do I have? 15 more minutes. I am not looking at my watch.

106
00:15:40.440 --> 00:15:47.440
So you have to understand, you the people of Ukraine and Russia, you have to understand that we who come from the West,

107
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.440
we have a great need of you.

108
00:15:52.440 --> 00:16:00.440
And we have to understand that we who come from the West and Russia, we who come from the West,

109
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:04.440
we who come from the West, we will be the same.

110
00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.440
Because you are positioned on the Agnya chakra.

111
00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:13.440
This is the narrow gate.

112
00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:19.440
And it is the last step before Sahaja Yoga.

113
00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:27.440
The last exam for graduation is always the most difficult.

114
00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:31.440
So we need your help.

115
00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:40.440
We need your help so that we may all as a global song across the Agnya chakra.

116
00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:46.440
Russians have the same problems as the French.

117
00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:57.440
Both the Russians and the French, they always loved strong leaders.

118
00:16:57.440 --> 00:17:01.440
So in France you had Napoleon,

119
00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:11.440
and in Russia you had Peter the Great, Nikolai the First, and the good uncle Joe Stalin.

120
00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:22.440
The problem with Sahaja Yoga is that we need to follow ourselves.

121
00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:29.440
We need to be our own guru.

122
00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:39.440
There is nobody between our Sahasra and Shri Mataji.

123
00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:50.440
Maybe some brothers are older, but they are like benevolent monkeys.

124
00:17:50.440 --> 00:17:55.440
No yogi is your guru.

125
00:17:55.440 --> 00:18:00.440
I am nobody's guru.

126
00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.440
I am a disciple of Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

127
00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:08.440
Like all of you.

128
00:18:08.440 --> 00:18:14.440
We are sitting on the bench of the same school.

129
00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:20.440
And if you follow somebody as your guru in Sahaja Yoga,

130
00:18:20.440 --> 00:18:30.440
you make that person a false guru. Don't do this to him.

131
00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:34.440
This is a karma that we need to go over,

132
00:18:34.440 --> 00:18:40.440
because communism is possible only with realized souls.

133
00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:43.440
And this is the karma that we need to follow,

134
00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:49.440
because communism is a way of living in the future.

135
00:18:49.440 --> 00:18:51.440
Do you understand?

136
00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.440
Thank you.

137
00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.440
We have been in Russia with Shri Mataji,

138
00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:13.440
and we have been in Ukraine with Shri Mataji.

139
00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:23.440
We have also been in other countries like Kazakhstan, like Estonia.

140
00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.440
And wherever there was a Russian collectivity,

141
00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:30.440
the collaboration was so beautiful, so peaceful,

142
00:19:30.440 --> 00:19:34.440
and frankly, they were so much better than in my own country.

143
00:19:34.440 --> 00:19:38.440
And when I was in the US, I was in Russia with a Russian collectivity,

144
00:19:38.440 --> 00:19:40.440
and I was always in the same country,

145
00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:43.440
I was always in my first country,

146
00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.440
and I was always in my second country.

147
00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.440
So, you know...

148
00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:54.440
Good night.

149
00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:04.440
Shri Mataji loved you very much.

150
00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:13.440
Whenever she spoke of the people of Russia and of Ukraine,

151
00:20:13.440 --> 00:20:15.440
she loved you so much.

152
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:21.440
So we really need you and please rise.

153
00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.440
Within.

154
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:32.440
Become within.

155
00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:39.440
Because spreading Sahaja Yoga is not the solution.

156
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.440
The Christians were very good in spreading something.

157
00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:48.440
If we spread Sahaja Yoga and we are not yogis, what do we spread?

158
00:20:48.440 --> 00:20:52.440
We spread Sahaja Yoga, but we are not yogis.

159
00:20:52.440 --> 00:20:54.440
What is Sahaja Yoga?

160
00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:57.440
Sahaja Yoga is not the solution.

161
00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:00.440
Sahaja Yoga is not the solution.

162
00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:03.440
Sahaja Yoga is not the solution.

163
00:21:03.440 --> 00:21:07.440
The Muslims were very good in spreading something.

164
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:11.440
So, who is against unity?

165
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.440
Is it the one who denounced falsehood?

166
00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.440
The one who is against falsehood

167
00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.440
and denounced falsehood is not against unity.

168
00:21:28.440 --> 00:21:30.440
False.

169
00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:32.440
False.

170
00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:34.440
What is wrong?

171
00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:38.440
The one who denounced what is wrong is not against unity.

172
00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:50.440
We are a spiritual movement

173
00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:53.440
and it is only in justice.

174
00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.440
It is only in sincerity.

175
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.440
It is only when we stop playing games.

176
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:08.440
It is only when we don't try to benefit materially from Sahaja Yoga.

177
00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:20.440
It is only when we don't use a position in Sahaja Yoga for personal influence.

178
00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:26.440
That unity is possible.

179
00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:31.440
Because unity is not officially chakra.

180
00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:37.440
For us unity is at virata level.

181
00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:42.440
And for this we need to cross Christ.

182
00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:47.440
And Christ said,

183
00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:51.440
Je suis la voix, je suis la verité, je suis la vie.

184
00:22:56.440 --> 00:22:59.440
I love you to my wife, she is French.

185
00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:06.440
I am the path, I am the truth, I am the life.

186
00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.440
And Christos says,

187
00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:12.440
Ya is pout, ya is istina, ya is siete.

188
00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.440
We are many who came, not so many, maybe I don't know how many.

189
00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:30.440
We are people who came from abroad and we thank you for your hospitality.

190
00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:46.440
We really from the bottom of our heart we love you and we respect you very much.

191
00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.440
We love you and we respect you very much.

192
00:23:52.440 --> 00:24:01.440
Ukraine and Russia should be very great nations in Sahaja Yoga.

193
00:24:06.440 --> 00:24:09.440
Not if we follow this one or that one.

194
00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.440
But if we become yogis.

195
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:20.440
Because in Sahaja Yoga we call ourselves Sahaja Yogi.

196
00:24:24.440 --> 00:24:29.440
We get a certificate before we pass the exam.

197
00:24:32.440 --> 00:24:34.440
Because our mother was very generous.

198
00:24:36.440 --> 00:24:38.440
But we still need to pass the exam.

199
00:24:42.440 --> 00:24:44.440
And this has to be with truth.

200
00:24:47.440 --> 00:24:48.440
The beginning and the end.

201
00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.440
The alpha and the omega.

202
00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:55.440
And why is it so important to be with the truth?

203
00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:02.440
And I will end this with this observation.

204
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:04.440
I have a question for you.

205
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:15.440
Because when we say,

206
00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:19.440
Hum tonei va sakshat shrikalki.

207
00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.440
So when we say Hum tonei va sakshat shrikalki?

208
00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.440
Shrikalki is the truth.

209
00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.440
Shrikalki is istina.

210
00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:35.440
And this is why the truth is the biggest destroying power.

211
00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:43.440
Because eventually the truth will destroy falsehood.

212
00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:51.440
See what happened with the Soviet nomenclature.

213
00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.440
It was destroyed because it was no longer communism.

214
00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:56.440
It was just mandarinate.

215
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.440
It was just a natural culture.

216
00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:04.440
See what happened to capitalist countries.

217
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.440
They are being destroyed by the capital.

218
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.440
It is finance which destroyed the capitalist country.

219
00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:13.440
Look at the game.

220
00:26:14.440 --> 00:26:15.440
What is capitalism?

221
00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:17.440
Finance is capitalism.

222
00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:19.440
It is a capital that is not used by the American people.

223
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:24.440
Because Adam Smith was realized and wealth was created to be shared.

224
00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:26.440
But they didn't share.

225
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:28.440
So you had two illusions.

226
00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:30.440
Communism and capitalism.

227
00:26:31.440 --> 00:26:32.440
Now they are being destroyed.

228
00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:35.440
Because what is the next age?

229
00:26:37.440 --> 00:26:39.440
What is called the golden age?

230
00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:43.440
It is called satya yoga.

231
00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.440
Satya yoga is the name of the world.

232
00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:49.440
Satya yoga is the name of the world.

233
00:26:50.440 --> 00:26:52.440
Satya yoga is the name of the world.

234
00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:55.440
Satya yoga is the name of the world.

235
00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.440
Satya yoga is the name of the world.

236
00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.440
It is called the age of truth.

237
00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.440
The age of truth.

238
00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.440
And if we want to be in that age we need to be true inside.

239
00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:06.440
And that is the age of truth.

240
00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440
The age of truth is the age of truth.

241
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440
So no hypocrisy.

242
00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:12.440
No hypocrisy.

243
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:19.440
No speaking about the love for Shri Mataji when we actually fight the next one.

244
00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.440
We have to fight the love of Shri Mataji when we fight the next one.

245
00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.440
No speaking of unity when we are those who destroy unity by wrong behavior.

246
00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:39.440
Truth is Shri Kalki and Shri Kalki is the truth.

247
00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:44.440
And He is the Christ King.

248
00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:49.440
And today is Christmas.

249
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.440
So we are all like little children.

250
00:27:55.440 --> 00:27:57.440
So we all take our ears.

251
00:28:01.440 --> 00:28:02.440
Everybody please take your...

252
00:28:07.440 --> 00:28:09.440
Shri Mataji please forgive our mistakes.

253
00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:15.440
Shri Mataji please help us to rise.

254
00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:21.440
Shri Mataji please help us to become ourselves.

255
00:28:25.440 --> 00:28:28.440
Because you told us the truth is that we are such a tannand.

256
00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:37.440
Please Shri Mataji give us the courage not to follow wrong leaders.

257
00:28:44.440 --> 00:28:46.440
Give us the courage to become our own guru.

258
00:28:54.440 --> 00:29:10.440
So if we understand that we need to love each other,

259
00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.440
if we understand that we need to be dharmic,

260
00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.440
then we will not be like the raksha self.

261
00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:29.440
Who love Shri Shiva and still they were rakshasas.

262
00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:37.440
Then we will be blessed by both Shri Vishnu and Shri Shiva.

263
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.440
Only with the blessings of our mother.

264
00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:52.440
Because without the blessings of mother we cannot please the father.

265
00:29:54.440 --> 00:29:56.440
It's only when she blesses us that we can please the father.
