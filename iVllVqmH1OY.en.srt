1
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:56,640
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

2
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:08,480
At the very outset you have to know that truth is what it is.

3
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,480
We cannot change it.

4
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:15,760
We cannot transform it

5
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:19,160
and we cannot conceptualize it.

6
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:25,640
Also unfortunately at this human awareness

7
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:31,440
we cannot feel the truth,

8
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:41,080
so something has to be done,

9
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:47,360
something has to work out in our human awareness

10
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,520
in the evolutionary process.

11
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:57,080
We have become human beings from amoeba.

12
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:02,960
How did we become?

13
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,520
And if we are human beings

14
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:11,840
have we reached the Absolute State? We have not.

15
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:16,040
If we had reached the absolute state

16
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,720
then there would have been no problems

17
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:21,960
because everybody would have seen the same thing,

18
00:38:22,120 --> 00:38:24,040
would have understood the same thing

19
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,760
and felt the same thing

20
00:38:26,920 --> 00:38:29,680
but because we are living in a relative world

21
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,400
we have all these problems.

22
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:37,880
As it is, most of the problems are created

23
00:38:38,040 --> 00:38:40,760
by human beings.

24
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:46,240
If you see ecological problems,

25
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:51,040
if you see economic problems, political problems,

26
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,960
physical problems,

27
00:38:53,120 --> 00:38:57,640
mental problems, family problems,

28
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:03,280
all of them are related to human beings.

29
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:10,360
So we have gone wrong somewhere,

30
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:12,720
there's something that's a missing point

31
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:15,600
which we have not realized.

32
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:22,280
The advancements we have made in our civilization,

33
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,200
say in science,

34
00:39:24,360 --> 00:39:29,880
has reached such a stage that we had to create atom bomb,

35
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,960
hydrogen bomb.

36
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:37,600
So all these mental efforts we have put in also boomerang on us

37
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:41,480
and create our destruction.

38
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:47,360
In every way we get frustrated,

39
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:52,080
and we start seeking what's the matter?

40
00:39:52,240 --> 00:39:54,240
Then we turn to religion

41
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,640
and we find in religion also

42
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,600
it just works worse and worse.

43
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,440
Whatever is written in the Bible,

44
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:05,240
same about written in Koran if you read it, or Dhammapada

45
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:08,560
or Gita everywhere is about just the same,

46
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:12,720
there's not much of a change.

47
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:17,360
But still we may follow any religion,

48
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,560
so-called following I would say.

49
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:26,880
Still a human being belonging to any religion can commit any sin,

50
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:28,760
any sin.

51
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:32,840
There's no binding force on him of that religion.

52
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:37,080
Why is it all these great religions,

53
00:40:37,240 --> 00:40:40,640
which were created by great incarnations

54
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:46,080
and great prophets

55
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:51,160
have taken such a deviated path,

56
00:40:51,320 --> 00:40:54,720
and why we have not been able to achieve

57
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:58,480
whatever they have promised to us?

58
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:04,280
What is the reason why we could not achieve that?

59
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:07,760
What has gone wrong?

60
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:14,480
If you read Koran you will be amazed,

61
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:19,120
the description of what was the vision of Mohammad Sahib

62
00:41:19,280 --> 00:41:22,440
is far away from the Muslims as they are.

63
00:41:22,600 --> 00:41:25,000
Same about Christians you can say.

64
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:31,440
When Christ has said "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes."

65
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:36,760
Difficult to find Christians who don't have.

66
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:42,800
In this way we have to realize on one side

67
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:48,240
whatever mental efforts we are putting,

68
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:52,480
or on the other side whatever

69
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,760
physical or emotional efforts we are putting,

70
00:41:56,920 --> 00:42:00,880
have come back to us,

71
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:05,880
destroying us.

72
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:10,280
We can see the result very clearly

73
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,800
why all these problems are there.

74
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:19,360
Still we adhere to something which is not reality.

75
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,720
We go on clinging to it

76
00:42:21,880 --> 00:42:24,720
because perhaps we are born like that.

77
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:29,080
Perhaps we think that that's we have done now all our lives

78
00:42:29,240 --> 00:42:30,840
so why give up.

79
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,880
And the forefathers have done the same,

80
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,840
you are doing the same.

81
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:38,480
But now a new category of very honest people are there

82
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:42,960
in this world who are seeking beyond.

83
00:42:43,120 --> 00:42:46,880
William Blake has called them men of God,

84
00:42:47,040 --> 00:42:51,080
those who will seek the truth

85
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:56,000
and they will make other people also godly.

86
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:59,840
That's the time has come, this resurrection time has come we should say

87
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,440
or this is the Last Judgment.

88
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:06,560
This Last Judgment is going to be done

89
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:08,920
by this Kundalini, the power within you.

90
00:43:09,080 --> 00:43:12,360
This is your own power

91
00:43:12,920 --> 00:43:14,920
which has to be awakened

92
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:19,440
and once it is awakened it passes through these centers as told to you

93
00:43:19,600 --> 00:43:23,160
and lets you know that these are your problems.

94
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:26,200
These are the problems of your chakras.

95
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:29,880
They may be physical, may be emotional,

96
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:34,960
they may be, could be also spiritual.

97
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:36,840
And once you know these problems

98
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,120
and if you know how to solve these problems

99
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:47,880
you can be a very normal, sensible, balanced personality.

100
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:50,360
That's not the only thing that happens

101
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:53,920
when you get your self realization.

102
00:43:54,080 --> 00:43:57,800
Firstly what happens to you is that

103
00:43:57,960 --> 00:44:02,360
when the Kundalini passes through your Agyna chakra

104
00:44:02,560 --> 00:44:06,720
then you become thoughtlessly aware.

105
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:13,560
If you see all the sciences they have created about religion,

106
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:18,480
talks and the whole thing, it's just mental.

107
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:25,360
It's not inside, it's not innate, built within.

108
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,400
So one thought rises, another thought falls.

109
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:31,560
Another thought rises and falls down,

110
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:35,440
some come from the future, some come from the past,

111
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:40,200
and we are jumping on the cusp of these thoughts.

112
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:44,120
But if you say now, this is the present,

113
00:44:44,280 --> 00:44:47,240
stop your mind at the stop point

114
00:44:47,400 --> 00:44:49,040
which is the present, you can't,

115
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:52,160
you just can't do it.

116
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:56,360
Between these thoughts there is a gap.

117
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:00,920
This gap is the present, but it's so small, it's so small

118
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:03,520
that you cannot find it.

119
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:08,080
But when the Kundalini passes through,

120
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,320
then this center, then these two institutions as you see them,

121
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:16,280
the conditioning and the ego are just sucked in.

122
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:20,120
As a result you become thoughtlessly aware.

123
00:45:20,280 --> 00:45:21,960
Means there is no thought.

124
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:25,080
But you are absolutely aware, very much more aware.

125
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:28,440
For example if you look at this beautiful hall

126
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:33,360
with the thoughtless awareness,

127
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:36,920
then the whole picture becomes clear

128
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:40,560
like a photo in your mind,

129
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:47,440
whole thing is stored up into every detail so clearly

130
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:49,960
because present is the truth,

131
00:45:50,120 --> 00:45:53,640
past is finished and future doesn't exist.

132
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,920
So to come to the present you have to have

133
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:01,200
this new awareness called as thoughtless awareness.

134
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:03,840
But when She crosses over

135
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:06,800
and pierces through your fontanel bone area

136
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,440
which is the actualization of your baptism.

137
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:16,360
Just people talk of baptism, "Come along I'll baptize you".

138
00:46:16,520 --> 00:46:17,960
It's not possible that way.

139
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,480
It's just an artificial ritual.

140
00:46:20,640 --> 00:46:23,480
Try to understand, this is not going to render

141
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:26,040
that actual happening within you

142
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:30,040
which is going to make you grow spiritually.

143
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:32,720
So the actualization of baptism takes place

144
00:46:32,880 --> 00:46:36,520
and you can feel also from your fontanel bone area

145
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:41,920
a kind of a cool breeze of the Holy Ghost coming in.

146
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,600
You feel extremely relaxed.

147
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,960
Secondly that you jump into another higher awareness

148
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:54,880
which we call, as collective consciousness.

149
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:56,840
This means that

150
00:46:57,000 --> 00:47:00,600
not only that you can you feel your own centers on your fingertips,

151
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:06,680
because these cool vibrations you can call

152
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:09,240
them start flowing through your own hands,

153
00:47:09,400 --> 00:47:11,600
you can feel them.

154
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:15,640
But also you get information about others

155
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:19,760
as well as about yourself on these fingertips.

156
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:27,320
Automatically you become like a person who is a computer.

157
00:47:27,480 --> 00:47:30,200
It starts working in such a wonderful manner

158
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:33,600
that you can find out about any disease,

159
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,120
any trouble without going through all the diagnosis or anything,

160
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:42,040
and if you know how to cure these troubles, physically, mentally,

161
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:46,080
you can definitely cure yourself and also others

162
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:47,920
if you have reached that state

163
00:47:48,080 --> 00:47:52,800
and have permanently achieved it.

164
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,640
This is what has to happen to us.

165
00:47:57,800 --> 00:48:01,080
All of us have to achieve that state

166
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:04,520
which is your right to achieve it.

167
00:48:04,680 --> 00:48:08,280
Sahaja means with you is born.

168
00:48:08,440 --> 00:48:10,560
This yoga means the union.

169
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:16,800
The union with this All Pervading Power of God's love.

170
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:22,760
It exists or not, we have never bothered to find out.

171
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:25,680
We see these beautiful flowers,

172
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:28,720
very beautiful flowers and everything around.

173
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:31,240
When I came from Sydney I saw the beauty,

174
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:35,880
the nature had just spread for the pleasure of human beings,

175
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:39,360
we never even think how it has happened,

176
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,960
what has worked it out, all these living things.

177
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:45,280
We don't even think how this eye of ours

178
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:50,480
is such a beautiful camera, how it has been made,

179
00:48:50,640 --> 00:48:54,480
how is it this brain which is such a great computer,

180
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:59,240
how is it made. Who has made it?

181
00:48:59,400 --> 00:49:02,760
They may say it is autonomous but who is this auto?

182
00:49:02,920 --> 00:49:04,440
We have never tried to find out.

183
00:49:04,600 --> 00:49:07,880
That there is this All Pervading Power of God's love

184
00:49:08,040 --> 00:49:10,240
which has done all this living work

185
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,400
and now for us it is to feel that,

186
00:49:13,560 --> 00:49:17,240
that is the yoga is, the union with that Divine.

187
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:19,920
It's not physical, it's not mental,

188
00:49:20,080 --> 00:49:22,200
but it is spiritual where

189
00:49:22,360 --> 00:49:26,680
you start first time feeling this All Pervading Power.

190
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:30,720
Then only you have to know how to use this power

191
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,600
which flows through you.

192
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,320
But it moves very slowly and people,

193
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:40,680
you see this is not a plastic work

194
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:42,600
that you can go on producing many

195
00:49:42,760 --> 00:49:45,040
and we don't have any organization as such,

196
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,080
we do not organize people

197
00:49:47,240 --> 00:49:50,760
and we do not take any money at all, you cannot.

198
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:53,920
How much can you pay for this Divine Work?

199
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,120
How much do we pay to Mother Earth for what she gives us

200
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,200
all these beautiful flowers?

201
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:02,680
She doesn't understand money, so you cannot pay for it.

202
00:50:02,840 --> 00:50:05,840
But there are many, many organizations afloat,

203
00:50:06,000 --> 00:50:09,480
which are taking money, which are giving you mental heat

204
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:11,120
and people run after them,

205
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:14,680
they like to go on working out that yarn

206
00:50:14,840 --> 00:50:18,480
that they have spun for you.

207
00:50:19,720 --> 00:50:24,400
One has to go beyond this mind to feel the spirituality.

208
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:28,160
With this mind, that is human mind, you cannot understand it,

209
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:30,360
you have to have Divine mind.

210
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:32,480
But once you get your realization

211
00:50:32,640 --> 00:50:35,080
your mind also gets enlightened,

212
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:39,560
and when your mind is enlightened, you can perceive,

213
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:43,360
penetrate into every situation

214
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:49,840
in such a deeper manner and the way you can improve it.

215
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,200
I can tell you a simple analogy to understand.

216
00:50:53,360 --> 00:51:01,160
Supposing you are standing in the sea and the sea is rough,

217
00:51:01,320 --> 00:51:04,440
you are afraid of the waves, very much afraid.

218
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:08,080
But supposing somebody puts you on the boat,

219
00:51:08,240 --> 00:51:12,200
and then you can see those waves and enjoy them.

220
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:14,680
But supposing you learn how to swim

221
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:17,480
then you can jump in and save them.

222
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,760
It is not any brainwashing

223
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,240
or any sort of a bombardment of words,

224
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:27,160
but it is something that happens to you.

225
00:51:27,320 --> 00:51:30,760
You become something as you have become human beings,

226
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:33,040
you become realized souls

227
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:39,040
as a result of this last breakthrough of your evolution.

228
00:51:39,200 --> 00:51:41,960
This is happening everywhere no doubt

229
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:44,840
and it's working out very well in,

230
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:48,240
I think they told me, 62 countries

231
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,680
but at least I know of definitely of 52 countries

232
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:54,280
where there We have got very strong centers

233
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:57,160
where it is working out.

234
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:59,320
Now whatever we are telling you here

235
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,800
you need not accept blindfolded.

236
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:04,800
Blind faith is of no use.

237
00:52:05,000 --> 00:52:08,080
First of all you must experience.

238
00:52:08,240 --> 00:52:11,800
Just like a hypothesis I am putting this before you,

239
00:52:11,960 --> 00:52:15,080
but you should have an open mind of a scientist.

240
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:18,800
Just open your mind and see for yourself it works.

241
00:52:18,960 --> 00:52:21,680
If it works then you have to accept.

242
00:52:21,840 --> 00:52:23,880
If you are honest you have to accept.

243
00:52:24,040 --> 00:52:26,640
If it doesn't work. If it works with many,

244
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:29,160
why not try and work it out.

245
00:52:29,320 --> 00:52:32,480
Most of the people do get their realization. I have seen it.

246
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,440
It's a wonderful thing that is happening

247
00:52:34,600 --> 00:52:37,600
that masses of people can get realization.

248
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:41,880
Depends on also certain places like Russia I was amazed.

249
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:43,760
Where they have not heard the name of God

250
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:45,320
they have never heard the name of Christ.

251
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,360
They were not allowed to read Bible or any book,

252
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:50,200
they had no religion at all.

253
00:52:50,360 --> 00:52:52,080
They believed in no religion.

254
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:56,720
Where thousands and thousands come to My program

255
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,600
and they all get their realization.

256
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,240
In a small place called Togliati

257
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:07,040
there are 22 thousand Sahaja Yogis practicing Sahaja Yoga.

258
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,960
Can you imagine it? I was so amazed.

259
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:15,400
Same about Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland.

260
00:53:15,560 --> 00:53:18,720
I was amazed how these people, Czechoslovakia,

261
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:21,560
how they have taken to Sahaja Yoga so fast,

262
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:25,080
just like fish to water,

263
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,800
how they realized it, and nobody else,

264
00:53:27,960 --> 00:53:29,720
all these false people, could not go there,

265
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:32,560
nothing could work out.

266
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,000
Only thing that has really worked out there

267
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:39,600
is something that is genuine. That is Sahaja Yoga.

268
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:44,760
One has to realize that as we are not in the Absolute State,

269
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:47,480
we have to reach to the Absolute State.

270
00:53:47,640 --> 00:53:50,840
That desire should be there.

271
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:53,240
If that desire is there it works out

272
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,240
without any difficulty.

273
00:53:55,360 --> 00:53:57,720
It is your own power which manifests

274
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,800
and gradually you can manifest them in such a way

275
00:54:00,960 --> 00:54:05,880
that you can do so many things like giving realization to others,

276
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:12,600
curing others and also enjoying it,

277
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:18,720
because when the attention is filled with the light of the Spirit,

278
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:23,000
it fills you up with complete joy,

279
00:54:23,160 --> 00:54:28,000
and joy has not two sides like happiness and unhappiness.

280
00:54:28,160 --> 00:54:33,600
It's singular, it's absolute and you are then,

281
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:41,160
they say they are swimming in the ocean of joy.

282
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:43,000
So beautiful it is.

283
00:54:43,160 --> 00:54:50,680
This new race, we can call it.

284
00:54:50,840 --> 00:54:54,120
The new society, is already formed.

285
00:54:54,280 --> 00:54:58,040
It's there, they're angel-like people, beautiful.

286
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:01,120
I never tell them, don't drink, don't smoke,

287
00:55:01,280 --> 00:55:04,600
don't take drugs, nothing of the kind. I don't tell them,

288
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:07,160
it just automatically drops out

289
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:10,240
because in the light they see the ignorance that they had.

290
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:12,840
They see the darkness and they just drop it.

291
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,680
We don't have to tell them anything,

292
00:55:14,840 --> 00:55:21,320
not to brainwash them or anything; it just works automatically.

293
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:23,920
You don't have to follow any kind

294
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:27,160
of a fundamental groups or things, nothing of the kind.

295
00:55:27,320 --> 00:55:32,280
You just know this is fundamental because you have got

296
00:55:32,440 --> 00:55:35,280
the light within you, then they see the goodness,

297
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:37,840
then they see the oneness of all the religions.

298
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,440
So if you know the oneness of all the religions,

299
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:42,520
why will you be fundamentalist?

300
00:55:42,680 --> 00:55:46,720
If you belong to one organization or to another church

301
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:49,600
or to another religion then you fight.

302
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:53,200
When you get into compartments like this, then only you fight.

303
00:55:53,360 --> 00:55:56,160
Everybody thinks we are the chosen ones,

304
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:59,640
that's how we have this fundamentalism now,

305
00:55:59,800 --> 00:56:03,600
knocking at our doors. So to get rid of it

306
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,600
the best thing is. First of all

307
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:08,080
you have to become a universal being,

308
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:11,120
and this Spirit is the Universal Being.

309
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,080
Once you become the Universal Being

310
00:56:13,240 --> 00:56:15,120
then you will be surprised to see it,

311
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:19,520
that all these differences you saw because of complete ignorance.

312
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:22,160
For example there is light you can see each other here,

313
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:25,960
but supposing there is complete pitch darkness,

314
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:29,760
you don't know who's sitting here, who is right, who is left..

315
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:31,080
You don't know how to walk.

316
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:34,360
You may trample over people, you may just get frightened,

317
00:56:34,560 --> 00:56:36,880
you may run helter skelter.

318
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:39,920
But if there is light you see things so clearly.

319
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:43,080
In the same way Sahaja Yoga works first.

320
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,160
Some people get not all the light I should say,

321
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:49,840
but they do get a little light, a glimmer of light,

322
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,360
and then it starts expanding. And when it expands

323
00:56:52,520 --> 00:56:56,280
you will be amazed how things work out.

324
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:59,360
Also I have seen people after coming to Sahaja Yoga,

325
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,040
they become extremely intelligent, absorbent,

326
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:06,560
and a kind of a very dynamic personality comes in them.

327
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:09,960
Now you have seen these Australians singing Sanskrit songs.

328
00:57:10,120 --> 00:57:12,240
I mean imagine, Sanskrit,

329
00:57:12,360 --> 00:57:15,320
even these English lived in India for 300 years,

330
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,040
they couldn't learn one sentence of Hindi language,

331
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:22,360
leave alone Sanskrit, but the way they are singing with such

332
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:25,240
clarity, even the Indians are surprised

333
00:57:25,400 --> 00:57:28,680
at how they are singing our songs in Sanskrit language.

334
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:30,280
It is an impossibility,

335
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,920
you cannot think of a Western person singing like this

336
00:57:34,080 --> 00:57:36,320
with all the rhythm and the melody and all that

337
00:57:36,480 --> 00:57:39,920
and in no time they pick it up.

338
00:57:40,080 --> 00:57:44,360
There are artists and artists who have now got world fame in India

339
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:47,840
after coming to Sahaja Yoga. We have got here also

340
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:52,880
some artists who were painters and have become very,

341
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:57,000
have got a good name for themselves. Everything changes.

342
00:57:57,160 --> 00:58:00,840
You become on top of the world but you don't become competitive,

343
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:03,200
you start enjoying each other.

344
00:58:03,360 --> 00:58:07,240
Such a brotherhood, such love, such friendship,

345
00:58:07,400 --> 00:58:13,520
that you become one drop becoming an ocean,

346
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,640
microcosm becoming the macrocosm.

347
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:20,840
We talk about these things but we have never achieved it.

348
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,480
Now the time has come for us to achieve all this.

349
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:28,680
In this one lecture I know I can't talk much.

350
00:58:28,840 --> 00:58:31,200
Last year also I was here

351
00:58:31,360 --> 00:58:34,680
and Lord Mayor was here also to grace the occasion.

352
00:58:34,840 --> 00:58:37,640
I found him to be a remarkable person,

353
00:58:37,840 --> 00:58:40,200
the way he got his realization.

354
00:58:40,360 --> 00:58:42,520
You are especially blessed people I think,

355
00:58:42,680 --> 00:58:46,400
Newcastle with this beautiful lake here

356
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:50,880
and beautiful surroundings, and I hope that

357
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:53,480
