WEBVTT

00:05.650 --> 00:32.960
I'm sorry for being late.

01:46.240 --> 01:54.600
I was really very happy to learn that Sussex
University Sahaja Yoga centre has been very

01:54.600 --> 01:57.590
kind to invite me to speak to them.

01:57.590 --> 02:07.750
It’s such a pleasure to talk to the students
because they are the ones who have always

02:07.750 --> 02:19.290
been, in any country, been responsible for
any new step, whether it was political, economic

02:19.290 --> 02:24.989
or social, which was to be taken boldly.

02:24.989 --> 02:34.030
Students are the people who have their idealism
intact still and when they are studying, they

02:34.030 --> 02:36.150
don’t get biased easily.

02:36.150 --> 02:46.540
They keep their minds open to every knowledge
because they are new to it, but those who

02:46.540 --> 02:54.620
become experts can become very biased, very
conditioned by what they read or they think

02:54.620 --> 02:57.019
to be right.

02:57.019 --> 03:04.909
But, the students can also be very much vulnerable,
because they do not know whether whatever

03:04.909 --> 03:09.799
new comes to them is the truth or some sort
of falsehood.

03:09.799 --> 03:18.709
So, at this life, when you are a student,
you have to be very careful to understand

03:18.709 --> 03:24.760
that if you have to seek the truth, you have
to be alert about it.

03:24.760 --> 03:31.450
First and foremost thing as students we enter
into university.

03:31.450 --> 03:38.799
It’s a beautiful name ‘University’ meaning
that you get all the knowledge of the universe

03:38.799 --> 03:47.290
and when you enter into university, you come
with an open mind and with an understanding

03:47.290 --> 03:57.379
that whatever you have to learn in the way
of a student, you are not the teacher and

03:57.379 --> 04:05.139
that humility always helps the students to
learn about anything they want to know about

04:05.139 --> 04:11.029
any part of their knowledge.

04:11.029 --> 04:16.489
Now what you learn in the university is the
knowledge of the tree.

04:16.489 --> 04:22.940
Knowledge that you can perceive and understand
through your mental activity, but what I’m

04:22.940 --> 04:27.639
going to tell you about today is the knowledge
of the roots.

04:27.639 --> 04:31.620
Roots of the tree, from where the whole knowledge
comes.

04:31.620 --> 04:41.290
Now to believe in me or to understand me,
it is not necessary for you to have any sort

04:41.290 --> 04:49.210
of faith in me or a sort of surrendering position,
but you must also know that if I have to tell

04:49.210 --> 04:56.860
you something new, you must keep your mind
open to understand what I have to tell you.

04:56.860 --> 05:05.389
When we study, say economics, take a subject
which is very common these days and it is

05:05.389 --> 05:10.250
even regarded as a higher science than philosophy.

05:10.250 --> 05:11.250
What do we learn?

05:11.250 --> 05:25.889
The essence of economics is very simple, that
‘wants’ in particular are satiable but

05:25.889 --> 05:28.260
in general, ‘wants’ are not satiable.

05:28.260 --> 05:39.710
This is the essence of Sahaja Yoga also, like
whatever you want to have, you can have today

05:39.710 --> 05:44.000
and tomorrow you will run after another thing.

05:44.000 --> 05:51.060
That’s why we have economics because this
is the tendency of the human mind, but why

05:51.060 --> 05:53.400
it is so?

05:53.400 --> 05:59.169
Why is it we really strive, supposing you
are doing your graduation, you will strive

05:59.169 --> 06:02.320
your heart to be a graduate but you won’t
be satisfied.

06:02.320 --> 06:07.520
You would like to do higher studies or like
to take up a job and even if you get a job,

06:07.520 --> 06:09.220
you will not be satisfied.

06:09.220 --> 06:13.659
Then you want to build a house, then you want
to have a car, then you students want to have

06:13.659 --> 06:14.889
a nice bike, alright.

06:14.889 --> 06:19.389
When they have it, they want something else,
a helicopter maybe I don’t know what but

06:19.389 --> 06:23.759
it goes on increasing, you are never happy
with what you have.

06:23.759 --> 06:24.759
Fully satisfied.

06:24.759 --> 06:32.969
Now the reason for that, you can find it in
Sahaja Yoga, because the roots are deeper

06:32.969 --> 06:34.400
down which you do not know.

06:34.400 --> 06:40.169
It’s alright to build up the whole science
of economics on something but what about the

06:40.169 --> 06:46.919
roots that have created this big tree of economics?

06:46.919 --> 06:53.620
The roots are that none of these material
things are going to give us full satisfaction,

06:53.620 --> 06:55.490
this is the root.

06:55.490 --> 07:02.540
So what is going to give us that satisfaction,
we come to the second logical question.

07:02.540 --> 07:07.370
What is the need of a human being to feel
satisfied?

07:07.370 --> 07:12.379
There is something higher, something deeper,
something that we have missed.

07:12.379 --> 07:16.500
This is definite, now what is that?

07:16.500 --> 07:29.050
We can refer if you are not upset or angry
or we can say biased about the scriptures,

07:29.050 --> 07:38.810
any scriptures, I’m not saying Bible or
say Torah or Indian scriptures or Buddha sayings

07:38.810 --> 07:41.930
or Tao or anything.

07:41.930 --> 07:47.380
You will find one common thing they have said,
all of them have said one thing common and

07:47.380 --> 07:52.139
that is ‘that you are to be born again’.

07:52.139 --> 07:59.919
You have to know your Spirit, you have to
become the Spirit because that lacking in

07:59.919 --> 08:06.919
us, in our awareness, because we are not yet
the Spirit, whatever we know without it is

08:06.919 --> 08:11.629
only the mental projection, which is limited
as our mind is limited.

08:11.629 --> 08:17.000
So to know the unlimited or to know the roots,
you have to become the Spirit.

08:17.000 --> 08:18.789
This is the first condition they have given.

08:18.789 --> 08:27.740
Now if you just don’t deny them, we should
look into it, we just have to become the Spirit.

08:27.740 --> 08:30.849
Now what is that, what is that?

08:30.849 --> 08:34.370
We can ask, which is the Spirit.

08:34.370 --> 08:40.780
If there is something like Spirit within us,
we have not yet felt it, we have never felt

08:40.780 --> 08:46.240
the Spirit within us and what is that Spirit
and what does it do?

08:46.240 --> 08:47.830
What are its qualities?

08:47.830 --> 08:49.470
We should try to find out.

08:49.470 --> 08:55.000
That’s what you can find out when you become
the Spirit, it’s a vicious circle.

08:55.000 --> 09:00.520
The other way around, here nobody will say
that you must become a graduate to know about

09:00.520 --> 09:09.120
economics, but the other way around thing,
you have to go deep down into the roots and

09:09.120 --> 09:10.580
how do you do that?

09:10.580 --> 09:13.290
Supposing I say you pay attention to yourself.

09:13.290 --> 09:16.630
A teacher will say ‘pay attention’ so
all the students will start looking at him,

09:16.630 --> 09:20.370
looking at the blackboard, but I say pay attention
to yourself!

09:20.370 --> 09:23.090
Then you will say ‘Mother how do you do
it?’

09:23.090 --> 09:27.280
It’s an impossible thing, how do we take
our attention inside, it’s all the time

09:27.280 --> 09:30.230
outside, how are we to take it inside?

09:30.230 --> 09:35.220
That’s why you have to get your realisation
first, you have to become the Spirit by which

09:35.220 --> 09:40.260
you can take your attention inside to your
roots, that’s why the first condition in

09:40.260 --> 09:45.900
the Sahaja Yoga system is that we have to
become the Spirit.

09:45.900 --> 09:50.630
Before that, whatever I say, you will say
how is it true?

09:50.630 --> 09:55.620
You can always challenge, you can always say
it may not be true, it may be wrong, it may

09:55.620 --> 10:01.870
be false…it’s true, because supposing
I have no eyes and you start telling me about

10:01.870 --> 10:04.220
the colours, how will I know?

10:04.220 --> 10:09.580
So, anybody will say open your eyes first
of all, unless and until you open your eyes

10:09.580 --> 10:13.660
you won’t be able to understand what I’m
talking about.

10:13.660 --> 10:20.900
In the same way we have to understand that
if we have to know about the roots, we have

10:20.900 --> 10:26.530
to penetrate within, for that we have to become
subtler than what we are.

10:26.530 --> 10:33.220
We are at a level from which we cannot enter
inside ourselves, so we have to become something

10:33.220 --> 10:40.260
else and that becoming is only possible if
you become the Spirit.

10:40.260 --> 10:42.630
I hope I’m clear on that point.

10:42.630 --> 10:48.910
Now, how to become the Spirit is the problem
because whenever a teacher tells you do this,

10:48.910 --> 10:50.230
you say how?

10:50.230 --> 10:58.920
That’s correct, I mean logically that should
be the question, how do we become the Spirit?

10:58.920 --> 11:08.990
Now if I say, this is our evolutionary process,
we have evolved as human beings, come up to

11:08.990 --> 11:15.790
this stage and if something more has to happen,
it has to happen the same way as evolution

11:15.790 --> 11:20.560
has taken place, automatically.

11:20.560 --> 11:24.550
What did we do to become human beings from
monkeys?

11:24.550 --> 11:28.250
If we have become from monkeys.

11:28.250 --> 11:33.940
I don’t think anybody remembers anything
they have done to become human beings or they

11:33.940 --> 11:39.720
have put in any effort to be that, we have
done nothing, we have just become human beings

11:39.720 --> 11:51.070
spontaneously or we can say automatically,
but actually spontaneity relates to a living

11:51.070 --> 11:52.070
process.

11:52.070 --> 11:54.640
Only living things are spontaneous.

11:54.640 --> 12:03.330
You want to sprout a seed, you just put it
in the Mother Earth, spontaneously it sprouts,

12:03.330 --> 12:07.360
we don’t do anything to it, we don’t stand
on our heads, we don’t read any book, we

12:07.360 --> 12:16.660
don’t say anything to the seed but it sprouts
because it’s built in, within the seed,

12:16.660 --> 12:19.450
the quality to become the tree.

12:19.450 --> 12:23.930
In the same way, it is built in within you
to become the Spirit.

12:23.930 --> 12:28.500
As you have become a human being, you have
to become the Spirit.

12:28.500 --> 12:33.420
That’s the evolutionary natural process
to which you have to take to.

12:33.420 --> 12:40.700
Now if you get satisfied just with whatever
state you are in as a human being, you can

12:40.700 --> 12:46.040
live, not impossible, I mean you can while
away your time, you can carry on but still

12:46.040 --> 12:49.230
you will not be a satisfied person.

12:49.230 --> 12:56.630
You will not be a blissful person, you will
not be a person who can be called as a person

12:56.630 --> 12:59.490
who has become an absolute personality.

12:59.490 --> 13:04.490
Still you will be living in the relative world
because of this mental activity which is going

13:04.490 --> 13:07.430
on, which will confuse you completely all
the time.

13:07.430 --> 13:11.790
You will not know whether this is good or
that is good, like these days in England we

13:11.790 --> 13:16.120
have a big confusion whether to vote Labour
or Conservative or this.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.810
We don’t know which one to vote so we will
close our eyes, whichever I catch, I will

13:19.810 --> 13:20.810
do it.

13:20.810 --> 13:22.140
We don’t know what to do.

13:22.140 --> 13:29.060
This stage will go away because we haven’t
reached that state of absoluteness where we

13:29.060 --> 13:31.410
can decide things with absolute authority.

13:31.410 --> 13:36.360
This is the thing, this is the right thing.

13:36.360 --> 13:44.060
Once we understand this state that lies within
us, then what do we do?

13:44.060 --> 13:53.490
We know what is right and what is wrong and
right can only be one thing, there cannot

13:53.490 --> 14:02.190
be any difference of opinion as to what is
right and what is wrong if you do it with

14:02.190 --> 14:04.950
your absolute awareness.

14:04.950 --> 14:11.620
But, human awareness is not absolute, if it
was so, there would have been no problem.

14:11.620 --> 14:17.100
There would not have been any necessity to
have this ‘mx’ authorised or have this

14:17.100 --> 14:19.640
atom bomb produced there.

14:19.640 --> 14:25.490
Human beings are the only animals that are
doing like this, you don’t find any dogs

14:25.490 --> 14:32.180
creating any atom bombs or anything to kill
each other, but this is special human failure

14:32.180 --> 14:39.660
to show that we are not at an absolute point
where we all agree.

14:39.660 --> 14:45.720
So how to achieve that is the second point
again I said it is spontaneous, it’s a living

14:45.720 --> 14:49.660
process and you don’t have to worry about
it.

14:49.660 --> 14:53.540
It’s all built in within yourself.

14:53.540 --> 14:57.440
So, how many of you have come for the first
time for Sahaja Yoga meeting?

14:57.440 --> 15:08.230
Let’s see…(Shri Mataji counted five new
people and continues) the rest of you have

15:08.230 --> 15:14.060
been to Sahaja Yoga meeting so you know about
kundalini, you know awakening of the kundalini

15:14.060 --> 15:16.480
and all those things.

15:16.480 --> 15:25.120
Now we have within ourselves, this power by
which it is going to happen to us.

15:25.120 --> 15:33.330
This is the power of pure desire, of pure
desire within us because so far as we have

15:33.330 --> 15:41.740
seen all our desires that we have cannot satisfy
us.

15:41.740 --> 15:50.590
So there must be some desire within us which
leads us to completion or to the fulfillment

15:50.590 --> 16:00.740
of our ultimate desire to be the Spirit, and
this power lies in the triangular bone in

16:00.740 --> 16:08.290
the lowest part of your spinal cord.

16:08.290 --> 16:19.040
Now this lies there or not, it exists or not,
whether I’m telling you is correct or not

16:19.040 --> 16:20.820
is to be found out.

16:20.820 --> 16:26.440
You should not just challenge it, you should
see for yourself that sometimes in some people,

16:26.440 --> 16:34.110
there are many who have seen it here, you
can see the pulsation of this power if there

16:34.110 --> 16:41.810
is an obstruction in this person and the awakened
kundalini cannot rise.

16:41.810 --> 16:46.920
You can see it with naked eyes absolutely
with naked eyes, a pulsation, just like a

16:46.920 --> 16:48.220
heartbeat.

16:48.220 --> 16:55.270
In some people it is so vigorous that you
are amazed that this bone behaves, this triangular

16:55.270 --> 17:00.100
bone behaves like a heart beating.

17:00.100 --> 17:11.440
Surprisingly, this bone is called a sacrum
and sacrum in Greek language means sacred.

17:11.440 --> 17:18.790
Of course for all our knowledge, sacred word
is only in the dictionary, we don’t know

17:18.790 --> 17:25.400
what sacredness is, what divinity is, what
auspiciousness is, thank God there are words

17:25.400 --> 17:28.050
but we don’t know what it is supposed to
be.

17:28.050 --> 17:36.580
Now this they call as a sacred bone and I
was amazed and I asked them, why did you call

17:36.580 --> 17:40.310
this a sacred bone, when I went to Greece.

17:40.310 --> 17:46.480
I was even more amazed to find out that they
knew a lot about this knowledge.

17:46.480 --> 17:52.910
They told me that they had rapport with Indians,
with great philosophers of India who came

17:52.910 --> 18:00.400
down and told them all about it and they had
this practice with them.

18:00.400 --> 18:08.850
Even the knowledge of their medical science
was very much based on those ideas, even in

18:08.850 --> 18:14.980
England, when you had your medical science
first, you’ll be amazed the basis of it

18:14.980 --> 18:17.980
was the same as Sahaja Yoga system.

18:17.980 --> 18:21.790
They had three types of human beings and they
are to be treated that way.

18:21.790 --> 18:28.410
But then suddenly I don’t know from where,
we started curing, not through the roots but

18:28.410 --> 18:30.720
through the leaves.

18:30.720 --> 18:34.270
If there is something wrong with the leaf,
you treat the leaf and then you find some

18:34.270 --> 18:37.690
trouble somewhere in the fruit, you see, it’s
like that.

18:37.690 --> 18:45.790
So the medical science became like that, absolutely
treating the leaves and the roots were left

18:45.790 --> 18:46.790
behind.

18:46.790 --> 18:50.250
Now these roots are within you.

18:50.250 --> 18:55.970
They are there all the time, you are not aware
of them, you’re not aware of so many things

18:55.970 --> 19:02.290
within yourself, but once you become aware
of them, as you get your realisation.

19:02.290 --> 19:09.490
As you get your Spirit manifesting in your
attention, in your central nervous system,

19:09.490 --> 19:17.790
when you start feeling the vibrations of the
Spirit flowing, then you can understand all

19:17.790 --> 19:18.790
about them.

19:18.790 --> 19:25.280
Whatever I’m saying here today, you can
verify it and can find out.

19:25.280 --> 19:31.080
To give you a simple example, is that when
you have to go to a class of astrology, you

19:31.080 --> 19:32.330
have to use a microscope.

19:32.330 --> 19:38.930
Now you say that I won’t use the microscope,
I would like to see the skin with my naked

19:38.930 --> 19:42.670
eye, you cannot, what you will see is the
skin that is there.

19:42.670 --> 19:48.490
But if you have to see the deeper structure
of the skin, you have to use a microscope.

19:48.490 --> 19:56.050
In the same way, if you have to see the deeper
side of life, you have to use the microscope

19:56.050 --> 19:57.680
of your Spirit.

19:57.680 --> 20:05.120
Without the Spirit, you cannot understand
what is beneath and what is above.

20:05.120 --> 20:18.070
Beneath is your beautiful being, the glorious
human being that is created by God and above

20:18.070 --> 20:24.610
is the all pervading power of love of God
Almighty.

20:24.610 --> 20:26.850
May God bless you.

20:26.850 --> 20:28.800
I would like to have questions from you.

20:28.800 --> 20:33.559
That would be better than to talk about it
because I must have given, I don’t know

20:33.559 --> 20:39.640
how many, thousand lectures so far and there’s
no end to it because this is a vast knowledge.

20:39.640 --> 20:46.250
Even if you have thousand universities like
that, I don’t think it can be completed,

20:46.250 --> 20:51.150
but it’s so simple.

20:51.150 --> 20:56.700
Once you become that, I don’t have to tell
you much.

20:56.700 --> 21:04.140
Like this room you have done, if I have to
explain about it to someone, I can write a

21:04.140 --> 21:06.940
book on this and still they won’t understand
anything.

21:06.940 --> 21:11.710
They will come here and will never recognise
that this is the book I’ve told them about.

21:11.710 --> 21:16.840
But if you just open your eyes and come here,
you see for yourself and know definitely this

21:16.840 --> 21:18.320
is the place you have to be.

21:18.320 --> 21:21.309
That’s what it is when you become.

21:21.309 --> 21:27.090
You don’t have to know all about it, you
just become that.

21:27.090 --> 21:28.090
May God bless you.

21:28.090 --> 22:40.990
I would like you to ask me questions, that
would be much better, what do you say Jason?

22:40.990 --> 22:53.880
Q: Is the energy tied physically to this bone,
the triangular bone?

22:53.880 --> 23:00.660
What happens to the poor unfortunate people
who might have lost the bone?

23:00.660 --> 23:09.820
A: No, I don’t think anybody has lost it
so far except they are devils you see.

23:09.820 --> 23:19.580
It’s not lost easily and I would say that
just now we should worry about ourselves,

23:19.580 --> 23:20.580
isn’t it?

23:20.580 --> 23:22.430
So we can help others.

23:22.430 --> 23:24.140
So we can help so many.

23:24.140 --> 23:27.200
If we are not equipped, how can we help others?

23:27.200 --> 23:30.140
First we should equip ourselves then we’ll
think about others.

23:30.140 --> 23:35.260
I’m happy you have thought for others, that’s
a good sign of generosity but we must have

23:35.260 --> 23:43.010
something within ourselves to give, isn’t
it?

23:43.010 --> 23:55.160
Q: In what way the chakras and triangular
bone, sacrum is associated with the physical

23:55.160 --> 23:56.160
body?

23:56.160 --> 24:00.740
If somebody is born with one arm, what happens
to the chakras?

24:00.740 --> 24:08.260
A: You see, even if you are, chakras are not
normally hurt because they are very much placed

24:08.260 --> 24:17.100
inside the inner core of the metulae, they
are very subtle things, they are not harmed

24:17.100 --> 24:23.530
easily, they cannot be harmed but it can be
possible that a person who has no backbone

24:23.530 --> 24:27.980
but such a person doesn’t exist.

24:27.980 --> 24:37.490
I have seen people with crooked ones and they
get it straightened and it can work out with

24:37.490 --> 24:50.600
them, but without a backbone we don’t exist.

24:50.600 --> 25:00.740
It’s a subtle thing and it’s an energy,
it’s an energy centre and it may be in your

25:00.740 --> 25:07.120
case it may be just on the borderline supposing
on the lumber area, it may move out with another

25:07.120 --> 25:08.120
one.

25:08.120 --> 25:09.730
So that is not so important.

25:09.730 --> 25:16.360
What is important is just now you see, instead
of going into details, first we must get our

25:16.360 --> 25:21.050
realisation and gradually you will be able
to locate everybody’s centres, where they

25:21.050 --> 25:27.920
are, because they pulsate and you can see
with your own eyes.

25:27.920 --> 25:35.790
Q: If you see them with your own eyes, presumably
you can’t photograph them?

25:35.790 --> 25:42.450
A: We have photographs also, we have photograph,
we have films, everything we have done, but

25:42.450 --> 25:49.030
as I told you that every person has a different
style of awakening, in the sense that in some

25:49.030 --> 25:53.990
people like a little child, or say a person
who is simple hearted, say from a village

25:53.990 --> 25:59.620
where he is not so complicated, I mean who
doesn’t think too much you see this chakra

25:59.620 --> 26:01.830
goes out if you think too much (Shri Mataji’s
hand is at Agnya).

26:01.830 --> 26:04.520
Or sort of obstructions like that.

26:04.520 --> 26:10.580
Then, such a person, if he takes, in a split
of a second the whole thing moves out, really,

26:10.580 --> 26:11.740
like a jet.

26:11.740 --> 26:18.860
But, in a person who is a little complicated
or has a disease or physically handicapped

26:18.860 --> 26:22.350
or any sort of thing like that, then it takes
time.

26:22.350 --> 26:28.270
It pulsates much more in those places where
they have a problem.

26:28.270 --> 26:29.270
So it depends.

26:29.270 --> 26:34.800
You cannot say that supposing you say that
take my photograph, it may not be there, so

26:34.800 --> 26:39.160
we have of course taken photographs, we have
films of that, everything.

26:39.160 --> 26:44.870
But on some people we have seen it, not all
because you don’t keep a camera there all

26:44.870 --> 26:50.960
the time to take a photograph, we have taken.

26:50.960 --> 27:05.429
Q: The

27:05.429 --> 27:12.951
camera is impartial so presumably if you find
one person who has this throbbing, you can

27:12.951 --> 27:17.150
do it again (Yogi: but surely Mother could
you also mention to him that the kundalini

27:17.150 --> 27:21.280
only throbs like that when there’s a problem
there…is that right?)

27:21.280 --> 27:23.360
A: What do you want to achieve by that?

27:23.360 --> 27:26.380
Let’s see, what’s the achievement?

27:26.380 --> 27:31.790
We should not side track, it’s a very important
issue but we should not side track alright?

27:31.790 --> 27:35.740
Keep it to the main point, what do we want
to do, why do we want to?

27:35.740 --> 27:41.050
You see the trouble is we would not like to
do anything wasteful, naturally, why should

27:41.050 --> 27:44.679
we do anything wasteful, for nothing at all,
isn’t it?

27:44.679 --> 27:53.470
What we would like to do is achieved easily
for the good of everyone without much difficulty,

27:53.470 --> 28:00.450
alright, so now to take a photograph, this,
that kind of a thing is not necessary.

28:00.450 --> 28:05.790
There is no need to do it, but we have taken
photographs, no doubt we have taken because

28:05.790 --> 28:12.450
you see many a times I have many photographers
with me and people with a movie sort of camera

28:12.450 --> 28:14.260
are going on.

28:14.260 --> 28:20.160
Then they have taken photographs, but it’s
of no use, as it is for our purpose, there’s

28:20.160 --> 28:21.490
no need to take a photograph.

28:21.490 --> 28:26.210
But we have taken and now we have got it and
now as your question moves further with it

28:26.210 --> 28:31.170
that if somebody has a pulsation, it may disappear
after five minutes.

28:31.170 --> 28:35.750
It may not be there, it’s just there for
the time being because if the kundalini is

28:35.750 --> 28:37.779
rising, it is moving upward you see.

28:37.779 --> 28:39.929
So it may not be there, it may reach another
point or it just come out from here (Shri

28:39.929 --> 28:46.840
Mataji takes her hand to her Sahasrara to
demonstrate).

28:46.840 --> 28:48.440
Alright?

28:48.440 --> 28:54.740
You should ask me questions which has some
advantage, you see, to you and to me both

28:54.740 --> 28:58.230
because this is of no meaning, that we should
take a photograph, then we should do this,

28:58.230 --> 28:59.770
there’s no need to do that, what is the
need?

28:59.770 --> 29:00.770
Q: There’s no need for you to do it…

29:00.770 --> 29:01.770
A: But we have.

29:01.770 --> 29:07.710
Q: I would have thought that if you believe
through true awakening people may realise

29:07.710 --> 29:20.770
the futility of desiring material things that
this was the sort of thing you would like

29:20.770 --> 29:24.500
to see established as soon as possible….

29:24.500 --> 29:26.000
A: That’s a good idea.

29:26.000 --> 29:31.520
We have got it you see we have got but you
don’t know, the media people want something

29:31.520 --> 29:32.780
bad to happen.

29:32.780 --> 29:37.030
They don’t want anything good to be said
that this is a way we can say things.

29:37.030 --> 29:42.460
I think so, because they are not interested
much, in this country, not in other countries,

29:42.460 --> 29:47.210
but in this country I don’t think they are
very much interested if I tell them that there

29:47.210 --> 29:52.820
is such a power and we have a photograph and
you can see for yourself, and this happens

29:52.820 --> 29:56.570
and cancer can be cured, they are not interested.

29:56.570 --> 29:57.570
What to do?

29:57.570 --> 29:58.570
It’s not easy.

29:58.570 --> 30:05.720
Q: On the contrary, if you could talk about
this …(unclear from public)

30:05.720 --> 30:11.860
A: Alright, so next time I give you the responsibility,
you get them to me, they are terrible, you

30:11.860 --> 30:12.860
don’t know.

30:12.860 --> 30:14.920
Just, I’ll give you a simple example alright.

30:14.920 --> 30:19.440
I don’t want to talk against them, they
are after all good people, but they don’t

30:19.440 --> 30:24.460
see the point you see, that is important and
they just don’t want to understand.

30:24.460 --> 30:29.040
Simple thing you see, they wanted to advertise
me alright, I’ll give you an example of

30:29.040 --> 30:31.549
these people, how their mind works.

30:31.549 --> 30:39.180
So, I didn’t want to say much but I just
said one little sentence that England is the

30:39.180 --> 30:44.410
heart of the Universe, which I can prove.

30:44.410 --> 30:53.240
And then I talked about William Blake, who
said that such and such a thing is going to

30:53.240 --> 30:54.630
happen and all that.

30:54.630 --> 31:01.170
Where he has used the word that England has
to become Jerusalem.

31:01.170 --> 31:07.860
I mean it’s an honorable thing I said for
them, so they raised an objection today only,

31:07.860 --> 31:10.010
that’s why I was delayed.

31:10.010 --> 31:17.440
Saying that if you say England is the heart
of the universe, the Arabs will have objection.

31:17.440 --> 31:25.290
You must understand, you see, you are a student,
you must understand what sort of people surround

31:25.290 --> 31:26.290
us.

31:26.290 --> 31:27.790
I didn’t know what to say!

31:27.790 --> 31:29.390
Why will they have objection?

31:29.390 --> 31:34.960
Because they too have a place in the universe
but England if it is the heart, I have to

31:34.960 --> 31:41.990
say that, but supposing I am honouring you,
why should you not stand for your honour?

31:41.990 --> 31:50.000
Because if you in any case go to Falkland
to save your honour there, and here if I say

31:50.000 --> 31:56.570
a simple truth which I know, you don’t want
to say that just in an advertisement because

31:56.570 --> 32:00.960
the Arabs may catch it and they may disappear
from Harrods!

32:00.960 --> 32:09.260
So that’s our media, must understand it’s
not so simple as you think but I’ll be very

32:09.260 --> 32:11.809
happy if you can get me some of them.

32:11.809 --> 32:20.490
It’s not easy, very difficult people, very
difficult.

32:20.490 --> 32:24.090
Q: Are you prepared to say anything about….(unclear)

32:24.090 --> 32:25.090
A: Yes.

32:25.090 --> 32:29.220
I’m prepared to say, not only that, but
I can prove it also but it is such a simple

32:29.220 --> 32:35.470
sentence, but I’m regarded as a Saint in
India, a well known Saint is saying that,

32:35.470 --> 32:38.510
one should take it as an honor.

32:38.510 --> 32:39.800
But that’s not so.

32:39.800 --> 32:42.810
That’s not so with people you see.

32:42.810 --> 32:48.120
Here I don’t think they take Saints seriously
in England, perhaps, maybe, but Arabs are

32:48.120 --> 32:51.350
taken more seriously, must say.

32:51.350 --> 32:57.049
Surprising you know, how can Arabs make an
objection to such a thing, I can’t understand

32:57.049 --> 33:01.510
but this is exactly the problem today I was
facing.

33:01.510 --> 33:06.960
So I think you are the students but you still
don’t know the reality of what these people

33:06.960 --> 33:09.110
are like but one day you will realise.

33:09.110 --> 33:14.030
I’m very happy your attention is on that,
I hope so it works out that way, then we can

33:14.030 --> 33:17.580
show them pictures and all that alright.

33:17.580 --> 33:19.260
Now what else?

33:19.260 --> 33:26.741
It had only one purpose that I could explain
it better to you because I didn’t know what

33:26.741 --> 33:32.370
to say to these people, the way they came
out with Jerusalem and the objection to Jerusalem.

33:32.370 --> 33:39.160
After all if William Blake said it but now
we can criticize it because the Arabs don’t

33:39.160 --> 33:40.610
like it.

33:40.610 --> 33:43.750
Is that the way to look at things?

33:43.750 --> 33:51.100
Are the Arabs going to decide for us everything?

33:51.100 --> 33:57.700
Q: Would you be prepared to make any comments
about life on other planets?

33:57.700 --> 34:05.340
A: No there isn’t any, it’s as simple
as that.

34:05.340 --> 34:12.800
Even if there are, they are not the type of
life which you are used to the different types

34:12.800 --> 34:16.730
of things.

34:16.730 --> 34:22.839
Different style of life, we cannot call them
as life because our concept of life is different

34:22.839 --> 34:29.769
so we shouldn’t call them but as human beings,
the awareness of human beings, there is none.

34:29.769 --> 34:38.129
But there is something like life you can call
it in some places, maybe the matter is moving

34:38.129 --> 34:53.090
like life but according to the human conception,
you would not call it life.

34:53.090 --> 35:04.759
Q: Is there any difference between humans
and animal life on this planet?

35:04.759 --> 35:07.019
A: Difference?

35:07.019 --> 35:08.150
Tremendous!

35:08.150 --> 35:11.569
I’ll tell you one example.

35:11.569 --> 35:17.180
You take your dog through a dirty lane, he
can pass through, you cannot.

35:17.180 --> 35:23.239
Thousand and one, there is such a difference
between animals and human beings.

35:23.239 --> 35:27.569
Q: You were talking about evolution earlier?

35:27.569 --> 35:35.039
A: Yes you have evolved to human state, no
doubt.

35:35.039 --> 35:52.579
Q: Would you say in the course of evolution
that all life forms were the same and at one

35:52.579 --> 36:28.220
point we came at a different life form.

36:28.220 --> 36:54.110
A: Human beings are made in such a way, they
can exist as people who can think and can

36:54.110 --> 36:56.640
create, it’s as simple as that.

36:56.640 --> 37:00.329
You see, that’s why they have developed
these things.

37:00.329 --> 37:08.859
Supposing an animal feels the dirt or anything,
he cannot remove it but human beings can.

37:08.859 --> 37:15.170
He can create, see this is the difference
and that’s why so many things that human

37:15.170 --> 37:27.820
beings have, are only as an accessory to help
adjust his life to his surroundings, alright?

37:27.820 --> 37:38.400
But say you take a horse or a dog, they have
a certain sensitivity to an evil spirit but

37:38.400 --> 37:42.579
human beings don’t have that much sensitivity
to it.

37:42.579 --> 37:48.509
There are some birds, if they disappear from
a part of Japan and all that, then people

37:48.509 --> 37:54.660
know that there is some sort of rumbling going
on in the Mother Earth and some earthquake

37:54.660 --> 37:59.229
is expected so people also start departing
from the birds you see.

37:59.229 --> 38:03.920
There are so many birds as you have heard
that they go from one place to another, from

38:03.920 --> 38:07.900
Siberia all the way to Australia, how do they
do it?

38:07.900 --> 38:13.309
We can’t do it, because they have a magnet
developed within them which can feel and through

38:13.309 --> 38:14.779
which they go.

38:14.779 --> 38:19.660
So, of course there are many things which
are dropped out in human beings and many things

38:19.660 --> 38:25.579
added to him, but are evolved because they
can create.

38:25.579 --> 38:28.470
You can create.

38:28.470 --> 38:36.069
Like an animal cannot create, that’s the
difference.

38:36.069 --> 38:52.539
(Same person kept speaking so Shri Mataji
asked him to give others a chance and also

38:52.539 --> 38:58.880
the discussion is not about evolution at large,
Mother is saying that if you do not accept

38:58.880 --> 39:02.410
that you are more evolved than animals, how
can I argue it out?

39:02.410 --> 39:03.869
It’s a fact.

39:03.869 --> 39:13.279
You are a human being, you’re definitely
more evolved than animals.

39:13.279 --> 39:19.900
You can organise yourselves better, you can
create, you can think, they cannot think.

39:19.900 --> 39:21.640
Can I talk to animals?

39:21.640 --> 39:24.180
Can I tell them what I have to tell?

39:24.180 --> 39:29.440
Not only that, their kundalini is not there
perfect yet to be awakened, this is the last

39:29.440 --> 39:30.440
point of it.

39:30.440 --> 39:32.479
That’s not so important alright?

39:32.479 --> 39:36.200
Now let’s see, some other questions.

39:36.200 --> 39:50.220
Same person still wants to ask one more!

39:50.220 --> 40:06.359
Q: If human beings have evolved from animals,
there must be something that was brought in

40:06.359 --> 40:09.859
to distinguish them from other things?

40:09.859 --> 40:13.530
A: Yes, very true, there is.

40:13.530 --> 40:15.269
Raising of the head.

40:15.269 --> 40:20.789
You see the way they have raised their body,
it has changed the shape of their body.

40:20.789 --> 40:26.729
That’s why you must learn Sahaja Yoga, about
how the shape of the brain has changed.

40:26.729 --> 40:30.069
What has happened that our attention has gone
out.

40:30.069 --> 40:33.170
Everything you must know, that’s very true,
agreed on that point.

40:33.170 --> 40:36.749
That’s the thing you have to learn.

40:36.749 --> 40:38.950
That’s part of Sahaja Yoga.

40:38.950 --> 40:41.530
Absolutely, what has changed human beings?

40:41.530 --> 40:45.390
First of all, they are given freedom, if you
believe in God.

40:45.390 --> 40:51.230
They have been given freedom to decide.

40:51.230 --> 40:54.230
Animals have no freedom, if it’s a dog it’s
a dog.

40:54.230 --> 40:59.019
If it’s a cat it’s a cat, nature will
remain the same, but human beings could be

40:59.019 --> 41:06.920
a scorpion could be a lion could be a snake
could be anything so the freedom that has

41:06.920 --> 41:11.130
been given to human beings has made them higher.

41:11.130 --> 41:18.309
They got this freedom in the expression when
you raised your head like this you see.

41:18.309 --> 41:22.489
Also some physical happenings take place within
you, which of course I’ll tell you later

41:22.489 --> 41:27.630
on when you come to Sahaja Yoga meetings and
all that, you will realise how God has given

41:27.630 --> 41:35.880
you freedom and by freedom what you developed
is the ego within you and that ego has covered

41:35.880 --> 41:39.789
your head and you have developed the ‘I’ness.

41:39.789 --> 41:44.430
That you are mr. x and mr. y and mr. z.

41:44.430 --> 41:50.440
That ‘I’ness has come to you, your own
entity as mr. x, y, z.

41:50.440 --> 42:00.450
You are cut off, much more from the Divine
power, in the sense that now you are your

42:00.450 --> 42:03.239
own guide.

42:03.239 --> 42:07.910
The freedom is given for you to try the freedom.

42:07.910 --> 42:16.500
Q: Are you saying that evolution was carrying
on in it’s merry way and God decided that

42:16.500 --> 42:17.809
some peculiar time …..(unclear)

42:17.809 --> 42:21.539
A: It is up to you, of course it is up to
you to decide.

42:21.539 --> 42:27.289
You see at this juncture you have to decide.

42:27.289 --> 42:31.730
At human level you must decide what you want
to do further, the decision.

42:31.730 --> 42:32.730
Finally!

42:32.730 --> 42:33.730
Another student asks:

42:33.730 --> 42:47.839
Q: You say the attainment of Spirit is the
necessary step to see into yourself, but what

42:47.839 --> 42:55.719
actual steps can anybody take for attainment
of spirit and is there only one way or are

42:55.719 --> 42:56.719
there many ways?

42:56.719 --> 42:57.719
A: There’s only one way of sprouting.

42:57.719 --> 43:02.200
Only one way that is built in within us, you
see, that’s the only way.

43:02.200 --> 43:15.440
Q: Why as an individual want to attain that
Spirit to look into myself, what should I

43:15.440 --> 43:16.440
do, what practical steps can I personally
take towards…

43:16.440 --> 43:17.789
A: Yes, that’s very nice to say, that’s
what we have to do alright.

43:17.789 --> 43:20.900
That I’ll tell you, that’s a good thing
to ask.

43:20.900 --> 43:23.869
That is something nice and promising.

43:23.869 --> 43:24.869
Alright?

43:24.869 --> 43:26.809
What else?

43:26.809 --> 43:36.049
Q: Mother, how far can the intellect take
us?

43:36.049 --> 43:39.500
Can we understand it with the intellect?

43:39.500 --> 43:43.369
A: How can you, you can’t.

43:43.369 --> 43:51.219
You see intellect can only tell you, like
I came here, it was written University of

43:51.219 --> 43:54.319
Sussex, but I have to enter in.

43:54.319 --> 44:00.079
This is like a signpost, with intellect you
can only know the signpost but you have to

44:00.079 --> 44:02.229
enter in, actually.

44:02.229 --> 44:03.900
Supposing I give you a chocolate alright?

44:03.900 --> 44:09.329
It’s written cadbury’s, you read it but
you have to taste it, you have to experience

44:09.329 --> 44:12.579
it, that’s the difference between the two.

44:12.579 --> 44:21.150
Just reading that mentally, knowing that mentally
is something like reading a signpost.

44:21.150 --> 44:23.799
Experiencing it is like entering into it.

44:23.799 --> 44:26.450
Intellect has it’s own limitations.

44:26.450 --> 44:33.440
Like, we had to leave our car behind.

44:33.440 --> 44:36.079
It’s beyond.

44:36.079 --> 44:39.930
It’s the intellect of the intellect, you
can say that.

44:39.930 --> 44:50.190
But it’s all poetry, you see what I’m
saying in reality we should see what it is.

44:50.190 --> 44:54.489
So should we come to your question?

44:54.489 --> 45:01.450
Shri Mataji asks a child what she wanted to
ask.

45:01.450 --> 45:08.910
Q: How does the kundalini raise when you are
rising it?

45:08.910 --> 45:20.839
A: When you are raising it how does it rise?

45:20.839 --> 45:35.910
It rises just like that (Shri Mataji makes
waving up motion with her hand) you have seen

45:35.910 --> 45:38.240
it, that’s it.

45:38.240 --> 45:44.460
Shri Mataji (so joyfull) look at the child…

45:44.460 --> 45:47.579
Now any more questions?

45:47.579 --> 45:48.579
None?

45:48.579 --> 45:53.299
So coming to previous question alright?

45:53.299 --> 46:02.039
I can tell you in an analogy sort of thing
because you see when you have to understand

46:02.039 --> 46:08.749
something mentally, you have to use these
worldly things to explain something Divine.

46:08.749 --> 46:15.539
We can say that if there is a candle which
is not enlightened, it cannot get enlightened

46:15.539 --> 46:23.109
by itself but it is ready to be enlightened.

46:23.109 --> 46:29.420
If you are ready to be enlightened, any enlightened
light can enlighten you.

46:29.420 --> 46:34.650
But the enlightened light doesn’t do anything
except you can say at the most it is a catalyst,

46:34.650 --> 46:35.849
at the most.

46:35.849 --> 46:44.019
But, just it is ready , it’s all there,
just an enlightened light comes near the one

46:44.019 --> 46:46.570
and it catches the light from that.

46:46.570 --> 46:48.390
It’s as simple as that.

46:48.390 --> 46:49.849
To give an analogy.

46:49.849 --> 46:55.380
As I told you, the seed when you put it in
the Mother Earth, because it is built in,

46:55.380 --> 47:01.681
it just sprouts, it’s built in, but the
process is that it has to be put in the Mother

47:01.681 --> 47:02.681
Earth.

47:02.681 --> 47:10.339
In the same way, it being a spontaneous thing
and absolutely a living process, it works

47:10.339 --> 47:15.869
in a way that, supposing you have somebody
who is an enlightened light.

47:15.869 --> 47:24.559
Say Ray has got enlightenment, for example,
so if he wants he can enlighten you.

47:24.559 --> 47:28.500
Once you get enlightenment, you can enlighten
another person.

47:28.500 --> 47:38.209
But Ray now knows what should be done to prepare
first of all the candle, to get rid of the

47:38.209 --> 47:47.849
obstructions, how to enlighten and how to
bring it to a full bright light.

47:47.849 --> 47:49.450
He knows all that.

47:49.450 --> 47:51.789
So there are three stages we can say.

47:51.789 --> 47:59.799
First is you are to be awakened, the kundalini,
it has to be brought out of your head here

47:59.799 --> 48:02.539
(Shri Mataji’s hand above her head) so that
the cool breeze of the holy ghost you can

48:02.539 --> 48:04.119
feel it on your head.

48:04.119 --> 48:08.900
This is the second stage where you start feeling
a cool breeze also in the hand.

48:08.900 --> 48:13.720
So many people don’t feel in the beginning
in the hand also on the head they do not feel,

48:13.720 --> 48:21.099
because it’s a very subtle thing, but if
a Sahaja Yogi feels it that means it has started

48:21.099 --> 48:22.569
but in a very subtle way.

48:22.569 --> 48:29.890
Then you must allow it to grow more and more
and to dispense all the obstructions on its

48:29.890 --> 48:30.890
way.

48:30.890 --> 48:40.329
Gradually, it becomes a steady light and then
a Sahaj Yogi any Sahaj Yogi can put it in

48:40.329 --> 48:44.690
such a way that you start feeling it in your
hands also.

48:44.690 --> 48:49.680
Starts flowing in your hands because from
the hands of a Sahaj Yogi, that power is flowing.

48:49.680 --> 48:56.020
With that power, he can handle the situation
in such a way that your hands start feeling

48:56.020 --> 49:00.309
it, flowing from your hand, flowing from here
(Shri Mataji’s hand above her head).

49:00.309 --> 49:03.930
Now, when it happens, suddenly, sometimes
it happens to people in a very sudden way,

49:03.930 --> 49:09.390
in a sudden rush also because they have been
seekers for ages perhaps.

49:09.390 --> 49:14.999
But then they feel, oh I feel very high, absolutely
on top of the world, I’ve become a witness

49:14.999 --> 49:18.589
now, naturally, because it is such a change
you see.

49:18.589 --> 49:24.390
But, that’s not the end of it because you
must know how to kindle it properly, to keep

49:24.390 --> 49:25.469
it going and all that.

49:25.469 --> 49:29.289
If you don’t do that, it will again come
down.

49:29.289 --> 49:33.539
You must learn how to keep it going, how to
work it out.

49:33.539 --> 49:37.410
That’s the part that’s the transition
part through which you have to go.

49:37.410 --> 49:41.450
Some people take at the most eight days, some
people take a month or so.

49:41.450 --> 49:45.240
But once you have done it, you become your
own master.

49:45.240 --> 49:47.950
To give another analogy, a very simple one.

49:47.950 --> 49:56.079
It’s like this, when you are driving a car,
there’s a break and an accelerator.

49:56.079 --> 50:01.859
This is the freedom that has been given to
you first of all, to learn how to use the

50:01.859 --> 50:03.109
break and the accelerator.

50:03.109 --> 50:09.849
To take the car in a proper way, to keep it
in the centre, the way it has to move.

50:09.849 --> 50:15.700
Then once you have learnt it, what happens
is that you automatically become a driver.

50:15.700 --> 50:18.289
Nobody has to tell you now put the break,
now do this.

50:18.289 --> 50:20.380
You know it, automatically you develop it.

50:20.380 --> 50:22.410
This is the second stage of driving.

50:22.410 --> 50:30.799
Now the third stage is that you really become
an expert in that and you drive without even

50:30.799 --> 50:33.489
knowledge that you are driving, when you are
perfect.

50:33.489 --> 50:37.079
But still there is one more stage left.

50:37.079 --> 50:42.339
That there is a master sitting behind, who
wants you to drive this way and that way and

50:42.339 --> 50:44.869
the master says now stop the car.

50:44.869 --> 50:45.869
He’s there.

50:45.869 --> 50:51.920
Now what happens that when you really become
a Sahaja Yogi, is the point, when you become

50:51.920 --> 50:53.880
the master.

50:53.880 --> 51:00.519
You start seeing the driver within you, and
the accelerator and the break, and you control

51:00.519 --> 51:01.519
as a master.

51:01.519 --> 51:02.959
That’s the point you have to reach.

51:02.959 --> 51:07.130
So these are the four stages through which
you have to pass, which gradually works out

51:07.130 --> 51:12.519
just like your graduation, without much difficulty,
for which you cannot pay.

51:12.519 --> 51:19.299
But you must have respect for yourself, you
must know you can do it and you must have

51:19.299 --> 51:24.069
that understanding that you are a human being.

51:24.069 --> 51:28.420
The epitome of evolution, and that you have
to become the Spirit.

51:28.420 --> 51:30.339
It works out.

51:30.339 --> 51:39.979
It works out very fast, these days and should
work out in this University also, alright.

51:39.979 --> 51:46.569
Analogy should not be taken too far because
this is Divine working and Divine working

51:46.569 --> 51:49.720
is such that we can’t understand how it
works.

51:49.720 --> 51:52.739
In the beginning, if I tell you, you’ll
be amazed how it works you see.

51:52.739 --> 51:58.519
You will say now Mother explain, but I won’t
be able to explain so many things.

51:58.519 --> 52:00.369
It’s tremendous.

52:00.369 --> 52:03.920
The Divine power has all your communications
and everything.

52:03.920 --> 52:10.810
It’s tremendous and in a split of a second
it works.

52:10.810 --> 52:12.479
It is to be seen for yourself.

52:12.479 --> 52:17.420
Now the time has come to prove the existence
of God, to prove the existence of his Divine

52:17.420 --> 52:18.420
power.

52:18.420 --> 52:22.329
For the first time you start feeling the subtle
power when you get your realisation.

52:22.329 --> 52:27.579
You start feeling it in your hands as cool
breeze of the Holy Ghost.

52:27.579 --> 52:30.030
First time, otherwise you never feel it, alright.

52:30.030 --> 52:34.619
Should we have it now?

52:34.619 --> 52:40.700
(Shri Mataji requests all new people to come
in the front row.)

52:40.700 --> 52:44.109
You shouldn’t mind if Sahaja Yogis just
put their hands above your heads.

52:44.109 --> 53:21.609
Yogis will not touch you, but just to feel
you.

53:21.609 --> 53:25.990
Now what you have to do is just put your hands
like this (open facing up), why? because these

53:25.990 --> 53:32.499
fingertips have got the representation of
your centres here.

53:32.499 --> 53:36.459
These 5,6 and 7…they haven’t brought the
charts but you can see later on, they will

53:36.459 --> 53:37.690
give you books to see.

53:37.690 --> 53:42.710
These are 5 centres, 6 centres and 7 centres
we have, so just put your hands like this

53:42.710 --> 53:49.339
and put your feet on Mother Earth, because
Mother Earth also helps us, wide apart without

53:49.339 --> 53:50.339
shoes.

53:50.339 --> 53:54.940
Everything helps us, like all the elements
that are there can help us and we have to

53:54.940 --> 53:55.940
use.

53:55.940 --> 54:00.580
So now put your feet on Mother Earth like
this and put your hands like this and you

54:00.580 --> 54:03.140
have to close your eyes that’s all.

54:03.140 --> 54:07.859
Just close your eyes.

54:07.859 --> 54:16.329
Now don’t try to control your attention
at all.

54:16.329 --> 54:22.200
Keep your attention absolutely loose, you
just don’t worry as to where to keep the

54:22.200 --> 54:25.299
attention, what to think, what to do, nothing
of the kind.

54:25.299 --> 54:26.470
Just leave it.

54:26.470 --> 54:31.160
Keep your hands on your lap and sit very comfortably
and it will work out.

54:31.160 --> 54:52.279
I’m sure it will work out for all of you.

54:52.279 --> 56:12.930
(Shri Mataji places her hamsa on the speaker
for a couple of minutes.)

56:12.930 --> 56:16.089
You should not open your eyes until I tell
you.

56:16.089 --> 56:17.089
Keep your eyes shut.

56:17.089 --> 56:23.949
Take off your glasses if possible, it will
be a good idea.

56:23.949 --> 56:34.719
It helps the eyes also.

56:34.719 --> 56:46.059
Stretch your fingers a little bit towards
me like that, just stretch them, that’s

56:46.059 --> 56:47.969
all.

56:47.969 --> 57:04.739
Shri Mataji rubs her hands and asks yogis
to see their chakras.

57:04.739 --> 57:06.640
(New people’s chakras)

57:06.640 --> 57:12.339
Shri Mataji rubs her hands and blows into
them.

57:12.339 --> 57:17.930
Right swadisthana is too much, I think you
all put them left to right, right swadisthana

57:17.930 --> 57:19.000
is too much.

57:19.000 --> 57:22.940
All of them have right swadisthana, right
vishuddhi and right nabhi.

57:22.940 --> 58:46.920
Put them left to the right, that’s the best
way, left to the right.

58:46.920 --> 59:04.170
Those who have got it, you can ask them to
put their hands and feel it, if possible.

59:04.170 --> 59:22.239
Please don’t feel guilty, any one of you
feel guilty that I’ve done this wrong that

59:22.239 --> 59:37.440
wrong, that’s not going to help us at all.

59:37.440 --> 59:45.890
(yogis working on all seekers)

59:45.890 --> 59:53.569
Forgive, forgive everyone, just forgive.

59:53.569 --> 01:00:01.940
What about this gentleman?

01:00:01.940 --> 01:00:21.130
Nabhi….let him put his left hand on his
liver, right hand towards me.

01:00:21.130 --> 01:00:36.719
Left to the right.

01:00:36.719 --> 01:00:40.559
Just don’t think, just enjoy.

01:00:40.559 --> 01:00:49.799
Those who have got it, just enjoy and don’t
think, don’t think.

01:00:49.799 --> 01:00:52.880
Now what about him?

01:00:52.880 --> 01:01:04.431
Heart, put your hand on your heart (Shri Mataji
moves her hand raising general kundalini and

01:01:04.431 --> 01:01:08.839
then around the heart)

01:01:08.839 --> 01:01:26.619
Ask him if he has done TM or something?

01:01:26.619 --> 01:01:28.599
Buddhist.

01:01:28.599 --> 01:01:38.469
Right vishuddhi is too much.

01:01:38.469 --> 01:02:14.180
Right vishuddhi, right liver put your habd
on his right vishuddhi and tell him to turn

01:02:14.180 --> 01:02:15.180
his head left.

01:02:15.180 --> 01:02:26.039
Mmm the whole muscle is…..better now.

01:02:26.039 --> 01:03:08.209
(Another seeker had ekadesha due to going
to another cult so Shri Mataji asked the yogi

01:03:08.209 --> 01:03:36.460
to put his hand around the seekers ekadesha
and put him right to left.

01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:42.819
Shri Mataji generally checked on the seekers
and directed the yogis accordingly.)

01:03:42.819 --> 01:03:50.630
Shri Mataji told a seeker who had been involved
with hypnotism to keep her eyes open and look

01:03:50.630 --> 01:03:57.400
at me, try to hypnotize me now.

01:03:57.400 --> 01:04:08.739
Alright now let’s see, watch me.

01:04:08.739 --> 01:04:20.449
It’s very dangerous my child, to do all
these things, very dangerous.

01:04:20.449 --> 01:04:21.449
Ah!

01:04:21.449 --> 01:04:27.150
Now see it’s up there, alright.

01:04:27.150 --> 01:04:54.709
But you have to do something more alright,
to get released.

01:04:54.709 --> 01:05:28.490
These are horrible things, you don’t know
how you hypnotize.

01:05:28.490 --> 01:06:12.039
Q: Isn’t kundalini something I have to raise
myself?

01:06:12.039 --> 01:06:49.449
A: Yes she can

01:06:49.449 --> 01:07:22.749
do also, but first of all

01:07:22.749 --> 01:07:34.259
you have

01:07:34.259 --> 01:07:37.160
to become.

01:07:37.160 --> 01:08:06.349
You have not become that, how

01:08:06.349 --> 01:08:25.040
can

01:08:25.040 --> 01:08:34.480
you do?

01:08:34.480 --> 01:08:49.529
What will you do?

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:57.449
Unless and until you become and you understand
what it is alright.

01:08:57.449 --> 01:09:00.589
Q: further questions..unclear

01:09:00.589 --> 01:09:05.160
A: First you have to become through the help
of somebody else, as I told you about the

01:09:05.160 --> 01:09:06.620
two lights alright.

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:10.259
One is an enlightened one, the other is enlightening
you.

01:09:10.259 --> 01:09:13.179
Once you become, then you can enlighten others
alright.

01:09:13.179 --> 01:09:16.009
So first you have to become that, fully.

01:09:16.009 --> 01:09:17.839
So they are just helping you.

01:09:17.839 --> 01:09:24.770
You see helping your light to be there steadily,
is it improving now in your hand?

01:09:24.770 --> 01:09:26.290
Q: No

01:09:26.290 --> 01:09:28.579
A: Nothing flowing?

01:09:28.579 --> 01:09:30.109
Q: No

01:09:30.109 --> 01:09:35.509
A: What’s the matter (Mother asks a yogi)….warm?

01:09:35.509 --> 01:09:38.569
It will work out.

01:09:38.569 --> 01:09:44.270
It has to work out first of all, you have
to become that you see.

01:09:44.270 --> 01:09:45.529
Q: what do I have to feel?

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.809
I don’t know.

01:09:47.809 --> 01:09:54.179
A: You will feel the cool breeze in the hand
and cool breeze out of your head.

01:09:54.179 --> 01:09:55.809
So many of them felt.

01:09:55.809 --> 01:10:00.820
Did you have any Guru or someone?

01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.460
No one?

01:10:03.460 --> 01:10:17.739
Q: Not in this sense but we do have a family
Guru.

01:10:17.739 --> 01:10:29.160
A: Who is he?

01:10:29.160 --> 01:10:43.230
Q: We are supposed to be followers of Mahaprabhuji

01:10:43.230 --> 01:10:45.480
A: Who is he, from Bengal?

01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:47.220
Q: No from Mathura.

01:10:47.220 --> 01:10:48.220
A: Mathura?

01:10:48.220 --> 01:10:49.840
What is the name?

01:10:49.840 --> 01:10:52.550
Q: Our family Guru but Valabh Acharya

01:10:52.550 --> 01:10:53.780
A: Valabh Acharya!

01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.780
Tremendous!

01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:56.230
Are you Valabh Acharyas?

01:10:56.230 --> 01:11:01.489
Q: He is supposed to be our family guru

01:11:01.489 --> 01:11:06.610
A: Valabh Acharya was a great realised soul
you see, you should get it in no time, in

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:07.610
the name of Valabh Acharya.

01:11:07.610 --> 01:11:09.679
Put your hands like this (open and palms up)
Was he the Ashtachaap?

01:11:09.679 --> 01:11:11.489
Q: Yes

01:11:11.489 --> 01:11:14.210
A: Oh tremendous!

01:11:14.210 --> 01:11:15.210
Hah!

01:11:15.210 --> 01:11:16.929
Got it?

01:11:16.929 --> 01:11:20.560
Are you feeling now?

01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:22.370
Q: No

01:11:22.370 --> 01:11:23.790
A: You should.

01:11:23.790 --> 01:11:26.620
Valabh Acharyas are great, they are very great
people.

01:11:26.620 --> 01:11:28.750
If they follow it properly.

01:11:28.750 --> 01:11:36.610
Q: But I can’t feel it.

01:11:36.610 --> 01:11:43.030
A: She has got cold that’s why her vishuddi
is catching.

01:11:43.030 --> 01:11:46.489
That is Valabh Acharya’s chakra himself.

01:11:46.489 --> 01:11:53.590
Yes his chakra is catching, he was great.

01:11:53.590 --> 01:11:58.250
They are called Vaishnavas.

01:11:58.250 --> 01:12:05.250
I’m doing all his work only.

01:12:05.250 --> 01:12:10.840
This is all Vaishnav Panth.

01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:13.670
What he said, I’m doing it.

01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:17.719
It’s not only worshipping him but you have
to become what he said.

01:12:17.719 --> 01:12:18.980
To be Vaishnav Janas.

01:12:18.980 --> 01:12:30.989
Q: Then you can be Vaishnav Janas by being
nice to people.

01:12:30.989 --> 01:12:34.840
A: No no, you have to become a realised soul.

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:38.559
You must have atma sakshatkar.

01:12:38.559 --> 01:12:40.630
Do you read him?

01:12:40.630 --> 01:12:42.760
Do you read him or not?

01:12:42.760 --> 01:12:44.000
Q: Not so much

01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:48.630
A: Then you read him, then you’ll understand
what I’m saying nothing but what he says.

01:12:48.630 --> 01:12:49.631
You have to get atma sakshatkar.

01:12:49.631 --> 01:12:53.199
Q: But I feel this is not the way to get it,
atma sakshatkar I must get within myself.

01:12:53.199 --> 01:12:57.889
A: Then why do you need Valabh Acharya?

01:12:57.889 --> 01:13:07.920
Q: I don’t know but I don’t think I need
some sort of community thing to start feeling

01:13:07.920 --> 01:13:09.219
in myself.

01:13:09.219 --> 01:13:12.370
A: Whatever you think is from your own knowledge
no?

01:13:12.370 --> 01:13:14.130
You don’t know anything about it?

01:13:14.130 --> 01:13:18.099
Then better not think about it because you
don’t know.

01:13:18.099 --> 01:13:23.820
Q: I’ve been taught a lot about Valabh Acharya
by family etc

01:13:23.820 --> 01:13:27.550
A: Did they get atma sakshatkar?

01:13:27.550 --> 01:13:28.550
Your family and people?

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:29.550
Q: I don’t know.

01:13:29.550 --> 01:13:30.550
A: Then how do you say that?

01:13:30.550 --> 01:13:32.030
They are not authority.

01:13:32.030 --> 01:13:36.420
Those who have got atma sakshatkar are only
the authority.

01:13:36.420 --> 01:13:39.179
Q: yes but how do I know who has got atma
sakshatkar?

01:13:39.179 --> 01:13:42.429
A: At least you try to find out, we are trying
to help you.

01:13:42.429 --> 01:13:45.300
We are not going to gain anything out of you
are we?

01:13:45.300 --> 01:13:46.300
Then why not try?

01:13:46.300 --> 01:13:58.389
Q: It must be more personal, it can’t be
done in a public way like this

01:13:58.389 --> 01:14:03.980
A: If you believe in Valabh Acharya, then
you are telling just against him because he

01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.570
never believed in this kind of a thing.

01:14:06.570 --> 01:14:11.720
It was all public, because he was a great
believer of Shri Krishna and not only Shri

01:14:11.720 --> 01:14:16.889
Krishna did Sahaja Yoga with gopis and raas
and everything, all publicly, he didn’t

01:14:16.889 --> 01:14:21.790
do it sitting down in the rooms, alright?

01:14:21.790 --> 01:14:27.949
So this is the wrong idea you have got.

01:14:27.949 --> 01:14:34.070
They have all got it I think except for these
two.

01:14:34.070 --> 01:14:36.090
She has touched but no use.

01:14:36.090 --> 01:14:42.030
You see she is neither a full Valabh Acharya
or not half way, so if you are educated enough…

01:14:42.030 --> 01:14:43.679
Shri Mataji interrupted by same girl in public..

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:47.449
Q: I’m just an ordinary simple person who
came here to find out

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:52.880
A: Yes, but what I’m saying is to find out,
you must accept certain things isn’t it?

01:14:52.880 --> 01:14:55.000
Q: Why should I accept anything?

01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:57.980
A: No, I’m saying you have come to find
out alright.

01:14:57.980 --> 01:15:01.590
If you go to a school or to university, you
have to find out.

01:15:01.590 --> 01:15:04.889
Not by giving your own ideas, ‘I think’
is not there.

01:15:04.889 --> 01:15:07.190
What ‘I think’ you listen to it, isn’t
it?

01:15:07.190 --> 01:15:10.650
I think whatever you think is different, that’s
the point.

01:15:10.650 --> 01:15:15.280
Q: That doesn’t prove that you’re better
than me or I’m worse….

01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.639
A: I may not be better than you or maybe worse
or whatever it is, but you have come to listen

01:15:19.639 --> 01:15:20.639
to me na?

01:15:20.639 --> 01:15:26.829
Q: If I would just listen to you and think
about it and thought your concept….but this

01:15:26.829 --> 01:15:31.119
kind of physical exercise is not working..

01:15:31.119 --> 01:15:32.960
A: Is it?

01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:37.969
Q: It doesn’t bring out anything in me.

01:15:37.969 --> 01:15:41.719
A: What I’m saying, it isn’t in you only,
others have got it.

01:15:41.719 --> 01:15:45.969
You are the only one who hasn’t got it.

01:15:45.969 --> 01:15:50.030
It’s alright, if you haven’t got it, then
you haven’t got it.

01:15:50.030 --> 01:15:51.489
We can’t help it also, we can’t help you.

01:15:51.489 --> 01:15:56.360
We are sorry, that’s all we can say, but
they have got it and all of them have got

01:15:56.360 --> 01:15:57.360
it.

01:15:57.360 --> 01:16:01.440
You haven’t got it and he hasn’t got it
either.

01:16:01.440 --> 01:16:02.440
It’s the vishuddhi.

01:16:02.440 --> 01:16:04.480
Both of them haven’t got it that’s all.

01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:07.100
Only two persons haven’t got, what can we
do about it.

01:16:07.100 --> 01:16:08.310
What about her?

01:16:08.310 --> 01:16:10.989
Is she alright?

01:16:10.989 --> 01:16:13.760
You see if it doesn’t work out what can
we do?

01:16:13.760 --> 01:16:14.820
We can’t help you.

01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:15.820
Q: unclear comments…

01:16:15.820 --> 01:16:16.820
A: It’s alright.

01:16:16.820 --> 01:16:18.060
That’s all, we can’t work on you.

01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:19.469
This is not possible.

01:16:19.469 --> 01:16:24.390
Q: I don’t want anybody to work on me, I
want to go myself.

01:16:24.390 --> 01:16:28.510
A: Alright so you go ahead work it on yourself,
alright.

01:16:28.510 --> 01:16:32.000
May God bless you.

01:16:37.889 --> 01:16:41.300
Easy to be worked out.

01:16:41.300 --> 01:16:43.969
I saw an Indian, I knew what was going to
happen.

01:16:43.969 --> 01:16:48.010
They are very uprooted, they neither know
the Indian things or the English things.

01:16:48.010 --> 01:16:50.409
You see nothing in between.

01:16:50.409 --> 01:16:53.000
That’s the problem.

01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000
Immigrants.

01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:57.889
They neither know the Indian things, I mean
she’s a Valabh Acharya.

01:16:57.889 --> 01:17:03.770
Anybody, we have so many disciples from Valabh
Acharya, so many have come and she doesn’t

01:17:03.770 --> 01:17:04.880
know what it is.

01:17:04.880 --> 01:17:06.449
Can you believe it?

01:17:06.449 --> 01:17:09.660
She doesn’t know what kundalini is when
Valabh Acharya has talked of nothing else

01:17:09.660 --> 01:17:10.660
but this.

01:17:10.660 --> 01:17:13.760
How can you believe she’s from Valabh Acharya?

01:17:13.760 --> 01:17:19.700
Just keeping a photograph of somebody is not
that, you must know what he’s talking about.

01:17:19.700 --> 01:17:20.600
That’s what it is, they are

01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:22.880
a very uprooted people in England.

01:17:23.980 --> 01:17:28.640
Very uprooted, they don’t know Indian music,
they don’t know anything.

01:17:28.640 --> 01:17:32.500
Just they wear Indian dresses that’s all.

01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:33.660
He’ll be alright, just

01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:37.920
he has centre heart, he’ll be alright.

01:23:30.000 --> 01:23:37.719
I ’ll vibrate it for you, it will give you
a better liver and the whole system will improve

01:23:37.719 --> 01:23:39.819
with that water.
