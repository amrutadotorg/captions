WEBVTT

05:54.240 --> 06:05.410
So now we have here one of the most ancient
places called Nasik.

06:05.410 --> 06:14.190
I think you must have heard about what happened
when Shri Rama and Sita were staying here,

06:14.190 --> 06:18.830
why this place was called as Nasik that I
will tell you in short.

06:18.830 --> 06:29.270
This is the place where Shri Rama and Sita
and Lakshmana were staying and the sister

06:29.270 --> 06:36.810
of Ravana, because Ravana’s some of the
empires, a part of the empire was very close

06:36.810 --> 06:39.780
to this place.

06:39.780 --> 06:46.600
She came down to entice Shri Rama.

06:46.600 --> 06:53.880
So Shri Rama smiled at her He said that, “It
is not possible with Me because I have a very

06:53.880 --> 07:03.130
nice wife” in His own sweet ways and He
is known for His formals, formal is not the

07:03.130 --> 07:06.960
word but for a sweet formalities, and we call
it Sankocha.

07:06.960 --> 07:14.290
He said, “You better try your hand on My
brother”, because He knew His brother is

07:14.290 --> 07:17.179
a terrific fellow.

07:17.179 --> 07:25.660
So this is all rakshasi, it’s all qualities
of rakshashas that women who are rakshasinis

07:25.660 --> 07:27.450
try to entice men.

07:27.450 --> 07:29.700
Men who are rakshasas try to entice woman.

07:29.700 --> 07:33.540
It’s a quality of rakshashas not human beings.

07:33.540 --> 07:36.250
And of course not of the Devas.

07:36.250 --> 07:39.190
So this rakshasini wanted to try her luck.

07:39.190 --> 07:46.280
With her ego she went down to Lakshmana and
she told Him that you are now living without

07:46.280 --> 07:53.250
your wife for 14 years and this 14 years are
going to be very heavy for you.

07:53.250 --> 07:55.100
So I think you better marry me.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.240
I am a good lady why don’t you marry me?

07:59.240 --> 08:02.320
So she said I have got a beautiful nose.

08:02.320 --> 08:03.320
I have got beautiful eyes.

08:03.320 --> 08:16.940
I am very beautiful, must be artificial, I
am sure or might have been to some sort of

08:16.940 --> 08:24.839
a Beauty Parlor or something, God knows what
she must have tried but she was trying to

08:24.839 --> 08:25.860
impress.

08:25.860 --> 08:28.160
And the fellow was getting infuriated.

08:28.160 --> 08:34.300
You see, He could not see it, to see that
look at this lady coming and trying to challenge

08:34.300 --> 08:39.290
My chastity and He got ultimately very angry.

08:39.290 --> 08:40.770
He told her, “You get out from here.

08:40.770 --> 08:42.570
I have nothing to do with you.

08:42.570 --> 08:43.570
You are useless.

08:43.570 --> 08:46.030
Don’t try this trick with Me.

08:46.030 --> 08:50.421
” But she would not go she was so enchanted
by Him and she, her ego was hurt.

08:50.421 --> 08:54.510
She said no, not to accept any defeat.

08:54.510 --> 08:56.590
She went on.

08:56.590 --> 09:00.660
Then He got very angry and He cut her nose.

09:00.660 --> 09:03.540
Of which she was very proud that I have a
beautiful nose.

09:03.540 --> 09:04.660
He cut her nose.

09:04.660 --> 09:06.690
And nose represents ego.

09:06.690 --> 09:12.940
See when people have ego, you see their nose
go like that.

09:12.940 --> 09:18.040
Like we have, you must have seen while coming
from Runala they said Duke’s nose because

09:18.040 --> 09:23.870
such a big nose they start it cannot be an
Englishman’s nose it must be Duke of some

09:23.870 --> 09:24.870
place.

09:24.870 --> 09:26.500
Otherwise cannot be such a big nose, see.

09:26.500 --> 09:30.350
So Indians call it as Duke’s nose.

09:30.350 --> 09:33.510
So the big nose, such a big nose she had.

09:33.510 --> 09:42.710
He cut her nose showing that he tried to destroy
her ego of her beauty.

09:42.710 --> 09:53.410
It’s very significant, very significant
that this Lakshmana resides in the stomach

09:53.410 --> 09:57.220
we can say on the right side.

09:57.220 --> 10:06.850
He looks after our right side which is the
liver, which gives us the ego part and it

10:06.850 --> 10:10.440
is He only who destroys it.

10:10.440 --> 10:13.010
So He is the big destroyer of our ego.

10:13.010 --> 10:17.000
It’s significant that destroyed the ego
of this woman.

10:17.000 --> 10:20.360
She could not entice anyone by cutting her
nose.

10:20.360 --> 10:25.610
Nose is a word call Nasika in Sanskrit language.

10:25.610 --> 10:32.440
That’s why this place was named after that
cutting of the nose, as Nasik.

10:32.440 --> 10:39.260
But as in every religious places we gather
all kinds of negativity, lots of negativity

10:39.260 --> 10:46.269
gathered also in Nasik and the people who
in the name of God thought that they were

10:46.269 --> 10:51.480
great place as we have in every religion,
you know in Christianity or in Islam, in all

10:51.480 --> 10:54.080
religious we have the same problem.

10:54.080 --> 10:59.720
The started their shops here so this one of
the shopping centers of God.

10:59.720 --> 11:07.040
Those who are interested in shopping of gurus
can come nicely to Nasik and empty their pockets

11:07.040 --> 11:08.750
nicely.

11:08.750 --> 11:11.640
So this one of the troubles of this place.

11:11.640 --> 11:15.390
And that’s why Sahaja Yoga takes time to
root itself.

11:15.390 --> 11:23.700
We have already given up Kolapur, which is
another great place we have given up.

11:23.700 --> 11:28.980
Pandapur and also in a way Thirujapur because
there they have all these negative forces

11:28.980 --> 11:35.590
acting and they are all making money though
the place is so vibrated, it’s so great

11:35.590 --> 11:37.800
because Shri Rama came here.

11:37.800 --> 11:42.810
He was not wearing His slippers, and His wife
also came bare feet.

11:42.810 --> 11:48.590
They all touched this Mother Earth so this
place must be very vibrated, no doubt, but

11:48.590 --> 11:57.490
all these nagativites are here as we are very
susceptible when we are superficial, people

11:57.490 --> 12:02.740
catch negativity first and the positivity
comes later on.

12:02.740 --> 12:08.830
Thus this Nasik place was contaminated by
those people who wanted to make money in the

12:08.830 --> 12:11.020
name of God.

12:11.020 --> 12:18.490
Now we have come here, one may say that Mother
we don’t get many people here or also you

12:18.490 --> 12:22.150
can say that Sahaja Yoga is very slowly moving,
I agree.

12:22.150 --> 12:25.099
It’s moving faster anywhere else.

12:25.099 --> 12:29.799
Despite the fact Dr Sangi and his family are
such strong people and we have some very strong

12:29.799 --> 12:31.289
Sahaja Yogis here.

12:31.289 --> 12:36.130
But that’s why we need very strong people
over here to work out these negativities and

12:36.130 --> 12:39.519
a day will come when they will all run away.

12:39.519 --> 12:44.859
Your coming helps a lot because you also channel
the Divinity and then you come to this country,

12:44.859 --> 12:50.440
this part of the country or to this place
which is full of negativity.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.160
Your vibrations help a lot.

12:52.160 --> 12:57.700
That’s why I always ask you to do some shopping
in Nasik and today if possible for an hour

12:57.700 --> 13:02.779
if you could do it would be nice but in any
case if you want to go to Saptha Shringi also

13:02.779 --> 13:04.010
you can go.

13:04.010 --> 13:09.270
Now continuing with the lecture I gave you
the other day about the beautiful mirror God

13:09.270 --> 13:10.970
created to see Himself.

13:10.970 --> 13:19.600
But after creating the whole universe He created
the Mother Earth.

13:19.600 --> 13:25.110
Then He took the Mother Earth towards the
moon so that it cools down and then He moves

13:25.110 --> 13:30.860
the Mother Earth towards the Sun and brought
it to a point where the life could be sustained.

13:30.860 --> 13:32.920
That is how the life started on Earth.

13:32.920 --> 13:42.580
In the Puranas it’s described that there
were Avatars of Shri Vishnu on this Earth

13:42.580 --> 13:47.230
who one by one lead for the evolution.

13:47.230 --> 13:54.140
Like that you have seen we have Macha Avatar,
Kurma Avatar and all those things about which

13:54.140 --> 13:58.030
you know and the new Sahaja Yogis should be
told about.

13:58.030 --> 14:03.720
Ultimately this is the situation now at the
Sahasrara where I had to come.

14:03.720 --> 14:12.270
At this stage the main job is to give Realization,
to raise your Kundalini, that is My main job.

14:12.270 --> 14:16.540
And that’s what has to happen in a very
large scale.

14:16.540 --> 14:21.430
In this country there isn’t such a problem
because very few places are like this where

14:21.430 --> 14:27.139
there is negativity, in the villages you have
seen how in that fisherman’s place so many

14:27.139 --> 14:32.779
people came who were simple hearted, how beautifully
they sang to you, they sang to Me and they

14:32.779 --> 14:34.360
were so nice.

14:34.360 --> 14:38.590
So this country is not such a difficult thing
to give Realization and to settle them in

14:38.590 --> 14:45.140
Sahaja Yoga because they immediately jump
to joy of Sahaja Yoga while in the West as

14:45.140 --> 14:51.490
you know we do not jump into the joy but we
first start seeing it through our rational

14:51.490 --> 14:52.490
being.

14:52.490 --> 14:55.420
Rationality then develops into what we call
the Chitta.

14:55.420 --> 15:02.110
Then we start using our attention for different
places seeing vibrations this and that but

15:02.110 --> 15:07.540
the joy part comes later on and that’s why
it doesn’t settle in many people.

15:07.540 --> 15:16.649
To begin with they have to be little bit,
ah, told and made to settle down because the

15:16.649 --> 17:35.150
nature of the Kundalini is such
(May God bless you, May god bless you, come

17:35.150 --> 18:01.629
in time – Shri Mataji is talking to someone)
All right God created this universe to see

18:01.629 --> 18:13.360
His image and as I told you that gold cannot
see its beauty, nature can not see its beauty,

18:13.360 --> 18:15.860
the Sun cannot see its beauty.

18:15.860 --> 18:25.610
So they have to express themselves, manifest
themselves to see their own image.

18:25.610 --> 18:33.659
Now God has created human beings ultimately
as I told you and now He wants to see His

18:33.659 --> 18:36.769
beautiful image in you people.

18:36.769 --> 18:42.690
So first of all to know that your mirror is
your Spirit.

18:42.690 --> 18:50.089
That is the mirror you have got which you
can see, which does not know its greatness,

18:50.089 --> 18:57.480
does not know its beauty, does not know anything,
in the sense that it reflects the beauty of

18:57.480 --> 18:59.639
God within you.

18:59.639 --> 19:07.089
Now you have to create an image or you can
say we have to manifest our work in such a

19:07.089 --> 19:16.000
manner that we see our image of this mirror
of God that we have got within ourselves.

19:16.000 --> 19:25.310
So when Sahaja Yogis start manifesting themselves,
ascerting themselves, projecting themselves,

19:25.310 --> 19:31.019
then they can see their own image and they
are surprised how can we (be) so beautiful?

19:31.019 --> 19:33.639
How can we be so nice?

19:33.639 --> 19:37.920
How can we be so powerful?

19:37.920 --> 19:42.329
How can we be the universal power?

19:42.329 --> 19:44.159
How we are helped?

19:44.159 --> 19:50.209
This is very surprising and that is how
(Please keep your eyes open otherwise your

19:50.209 --> 19:51.620
Chakras won’t be all right – Shri Mataji
is talking to someone)

19:51.620 --> 20:04.980
So when you get all these experiences of your
goodness, of your greatness, of your glory,

20:04.980 --> 20:07.189
you start manifesting God.

20:07.189 --> 20:10.180
So now for God your mirror is ready.

20:10.180 --> 20:13.589
For Him you are His mirror.

20:13.589 --> 20:17.350
And He wants to see Himself through you.

20:17.350 --> 20:22.399
So all the beauty that you have, all the powers
you have are within you.

20:22.399 --> 20:28.990
But most of the religions which are established
by great saints who wanted to help in this

20:28.990 --> 20:34.409
procedure have been just reversed that you
are told that you are the worst, you are the

20:34.409 --> 20:37.500
sinners, you are the hopeless people, good
for nothing.

20:37.500 --> 20:42.879
So that you will go and give more money and
more money and that’s another stupidity.

20:42.879 --> 20:47.250
You can see so clearly how stupid the whole
effort is.

20:47.250 --> 20:50.210
By doing that you make people look ugly, sickly,
useless.

20:50.210 --> 20:58.139
The whole system, the whole civilization works
in the other way round.

20:58.139 --> 21:05.731
For example, if nowadays I have seen in the
West that if you look like a TB patient you

21:05.731 --> 21:11.902
are regarded as beauty or some sort of a bhoot
you are regarded as beauty.

21:11.902 --> 21:18.550
On the contrary, you have to look healthy,
blossoming like a flower, fresh, that is the

21:18.550 --> 21:28.290
sign of a person who is beautiful, not a person
who is all the time sighing and who is about

21:28.290 --> 21:36.020
to shift into the hospital or into a grave
yard, that sort of an idea God never had in

21:36.020 --> 21:37.020
His mind.

21:37.020 --> 21:44.620
This the idea which has come to you through
the clever management of some of the evil

21:44.620 --> 21:45.699
doers.

21:45.699 --> 21:49.589
And they have given you these ideas and you
are working them out.

21:49.589 --> 21:56.540
So the sense of beauty that you have has to
be a little different, much different as it

21:56.540 --> 21:59.240
absolutely just opposition.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.939
The face of a person who is a Realized soul
is very different from faces of others.

22:03.939 --> 22:10.330
To them he may not be beautiful because they
see the ugliness while we see the real beauty

22:10.330 --> 22:12.000
that pleases God.

22:12.000 --> 22:16.500
It should please God to see your faces, reflecting
His manifestation.

22:16.500 --> 22:23.290
Like you see the flowers, you like the flowers
which are fresh, you look at them with great

22:23.290 --> 22:24.290
admiration.

22:24.290 --> 22:31.620
In the same way when God see His reflection
among Sahaja Yogis, He will very much fulfilled.

22:31.620 --> 22:36.439
And that’s what I felt yesterday when you
all sang together with all the East and the

22:36.439 --> 22:39.270
West combine together with such beauty.

22:39.270 --> 22:46.410
I felt that I was fulfilled within Myself
that something has been happening and something

22:46.410 --> 22:47.930
has shown the results.

22:47.930 --> 22:51.530
The beauty is showing now on the faces of
My children.

22:51.530 --> 22:55.620
We should please God.

22:55.620 --> 22:58.860
We should please Me very much.

22:58.860 --> 23:02.620
So this is a very great thing that has happening
in Nasik I think.

23:02.620 --> 23:12.659
This gratitude of yours and My own gratification,
I felt very gratified.

23:12.659 --> 23:15.600
I felt very satisfied and fulfilled.

23:15.600 --> 23:26.520
And that is the thing in a place like this
where Sita had to suffer so much, where Lakshmana

23:26.520 --> 23:28.320
had to do all these ugly things.

23:28.320 --> 23:31.330
It was terrible thing that happened in Nasik.

23:31.330 --> 23:37.539
And then if you get in that background, like
in a drama you see, you show a climax and

23:37.539 --> 23:39.650
then the anticlimax like that.

23:39.650 --> 23:42.560
Yesterday I felt the drama is complete now.

23:42.560 --> 23:48.179
I was really very much satisfied what happened
last night, the oneness with which we sang,

23:48.179 --> 23:51.970
the oneness we felt and the oneness we had
about ourselves.

23:51.970 --> 23:54.160
We are universal beings.

23:54.160 --> 23:55.750
We do not belong to any country.

23:55.750 --> 24:00.289
We do not belong to any cast, community or
so called religions.

24:00.289 --> 24:02.090
We are all universal people.

24:02.090 --> 24:07.960
We have no such bondages, which keep us separate
from each other.

24:07.960 --> 24:14.980
All this love, all this affection and all
this is going to transform this horrible world

24:14.980 --> 24:21.189
into the right path, into the righteous path,
into the path of benevolence.

24:21.189 --> 24:24.279
So Nasik has done something good to Me.

24:24.279 --> 24:29.560
Last time I had tears in My eyes and you have
taken the photograph of this Sandra Karuna

24:29.560 --> 24:33.320
and today I have got the feeling of great
joy within Myself.

24:33.320 --> 24:37.160
May God bless you all. Thank you.
