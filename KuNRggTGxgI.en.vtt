00:01:50.322 --> 00:01:57.132
I bow to all the seekers of Truth.

00:01:57.132 --> 00:02:11.392
When we are seeking the Truth we have to know
we have to be honest about it.

00:02:11.392 --> 00:02:15.542
Because it is benevolent for us, not for others.

00:02:15.542 --> 00:02:22.241
We are seeking the Truth for ourselves, not
for others.

00:02:22.241 --> 00:02:31.581
The another thing we have to remember, very
humbly, that truth is what it is.

00:02:31.581 --> 00:02:38.322
We can not change it, we can not organize
it, we can not maneuver it.

00:02:38.322 --> 00:02:43.532
It is what has been and will be.

00:02:43.532 --> 00:02:48.032
And what is the Truth?

00:02:48.032 --> 00:02:53.521
The truth is that you are the Spirit.

00:02:53.521 --> 00:03:03.832
You are not this body, you are not this mind,
you are not this ego, and you are not this

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:04.972
conditioning.

00:03:04.972 --> 00:03:06.871
You are the Spirit.

00:03:06.871 --> 00:03:12.542
But so far you have been a humane being.

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:21.882
But to be humane being itself is a very great
thing.

00:03:21.882 --> 00:03:25.911
Is the greatest thing – to be a humane being.

00:03:25.911 --> 00:03:35.341
Perhaps we have not realized the value of
our life because we do not know what we are.

00:03:35.341 --> 00:03:48.582
The way we waste our time, waste our energies,
waste our attention on things, which are senseless,

00:03:48.582 --> 00:03:57.412
because we still have to understand the greatness
of our being.

00:03:57.412 --> 00:04:09.722
Humane beings are made with such care, so
beautifully, such delicate working of the

00:04:09.722 --> 00:04:16.472
Divine from ameba to this stage passing through
various stages, such a beautiful thing has

00:04:16.472 --> 00:04:20.251
been created as a humane being.

00:04:20.251 --> 00:04:26.891
But first we must have this attention to our
Self that there must be something.

00:04:26.891 --> 00:04:35.501
It can not be a purposelessly [WAY or DOING],
it can not be something just a chance.

00:04:35.501 --> 00:04:38.822
Is a wrong idea to play with.

00:04:38.822 --> 00:04:53.242
If the gravitation force of the Earth or anyone
of the galaxies changes, then be disaster,

00:04:53.242 --> 00:04:55.912
absolute disaster.

00:04:55.912 --> 00:05:01.492
So many things in the cosmos, if you study,
the coefficients that works out, the different

00:05:01.492 --> 00:05:08.912
balancing and the different weights and the
movements of the different bodies show us

00:05:08.912 --> 00:05:10.591
that there must be some purpose.

00:05:10.591 --> 00:05:20.492
And they do not trouble us; it’s all as
if made for the stage for humane beings.

00:05:20.492 --> 00:05:24.421
That the humane beings have to come on the
stage and all the preparation is made for

00:05:24.421 --> 00:05:28.212
the great drama.

00:05:28.212 --> 00:05:34.781
I think it’s high time that great scientists
should look at it and start wondering why

00:05:34.781 --> 00:05:37.922
is it the way it is made.

00:05:37.922 --> 00:05:42.992
Why we are so much looked after.

00:05:42.992 --> 00:05:52.002
The whole cosmos seems to be within ourselves
as if we have buttons, which move the cosmos,

00:05:52.002 --> 00:05:56.511
which control the cosmos.

00:05:56.511 --> 00:06:03.732
Everything is going on so smoothly otherwise,
except when we do not try to understand ourselves.

00:06:03.732 --> 00:06:14.051
It has been said practically in all the Scriptures
that you have to seek your Self; you have

00:06:14.051 --> 00:06:16.212
to find your Self.

00:06:16.212 --> 00:06:26.572
Though I think many of this Scriptures have
been little bit changed and have been used

00:06:26.572 --> 00:06:34.072
for certain purposes, still they could not
get over this point that you have to become

00:06:34.072 --> 00:06:38.612
the Self, you have to be born again.

00:06:38.612 --> 00:06:41.992
But that is not an artificial thing.

00:06:41.992 --> 00:06:46.172
We are humane beings not artificially made.

00:06:46.172 --> 00:06:52.252
We are made really by some sort of a living
force from ameba.

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:59.242
We are not just made with some sort of a thinking
or a mental projection.

00:06:59.242 --> 00:07:06.902
It is not a mental projection by which we
have been humane beings, it is something spontaneously

00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:13.572
happening, a living force within us, which
has brought us to this stage - with a purpose,

00:07:13.572 --> 00:07:15.482
with a meaning.

00:07:15.482 --> 00:07:22.692
And now at this stage we are free to do what
we like.

00:07:22.692 --> 00:07:27.852
Many people ask Me, “What was the need to
give this freedom to humane beings?”

00:07:27.852 --> 00:07:29.982
It was very necessary.

00:07:29.982 --> 00:07:37.521
If you have to have the ultimate freedom you
must know how to deal with it.

00:07:37.521 --> 00:07:38.982
You have to understand.

00:07:38.982 --> 00:07:43.042
Of course, humane beings have to make mistakes.

00:07:43.042 --> 00:07:45.332
To err is humane.

00:07:45.332 --> 00:07:56.152
And we have to understand that this trial
– error and trial and error business – has

00:07:56.152 --> 00:08:02.741
made us understand, also those who have not
understood must understand, that there must

00:08:02.741 --> 00:08:10.632
be a wiser or surer way to achieve that goal
of Self-Realization, of Self-knowledge.

00:08:10.632 --> 00:08:22.252
Self-knowledge we do not have, we must admit
very humbly, we have had no system by which

00:08:22.252 --> 00:08:24.032
we could know ourselves.

00:08:24.032 --> 00:08:28.542
But think of a computer that is a humane being
is.

00:08:28.542 --> 00:08:31.942
As soon as you see Me you know I am there.

00:08:31.942 --> 00:08:39.361
You don’t have to go for programming, you
don’t have to consult anything, you don’t

00:08:39.361 --> 00:08:47.272
have to use any kind of computer or some sort
of a complicated machinery, automatically,

00:08:47.272 --> 00:08:52.942
spontaneously in a split of a second you know
that I’m standing before you and talking

00:08:52.942 --> 00:08:53.942
to you.

00:08:53.942 --> 00:08:55.512
Such a computer we can not create.

00:08:55.512 --> 00:09:01.192
But the Divine has created such a great computer
and that is the humane being.

00:09:01.192 --> 00:09:07.211
And this humane being is the only one who
is going to achieve that higher state, which

00:09:07.211 --> 00:09:12.302
we call as the spiritual state of the Self.

00:09:12.302 --> 00:09:20.611
Because in the science they deal with the
tree, I should say, the outside, but they

00:09:20.611 --> 00:09:24.202
can not go into the roots.

00:09:24.202 --> 00:09:28.652
To go into the roots you have to become a
subtler being.

00:09:28.652 --> 00:09:32.461
Unless and until you become a subtler being
you can not go into your roots to find out

00:09:32.461 --> 00:09:34.772
what are your roots are.

00:09:34.772 --> 00:09:38.022
And that is what is Self-Realization.

00:09:38.022 --> 00:09:45.512
When you become subtler then only you can
go into your being and can find out what actually

00:09:45.512 --> 00:09:46.512
you are.

00:09:46.512 --> 00:09:55.282
Also to look after a tree, which has not know
its roots, is a very difficult thing.

00:09:55.282 --> 00:10:02.032
What happens is that when you do not know
your roots and you start growing, and growing,

00:10:02.032 --> 00:10:12.212
and growing you go very deep down into that
where you find that you have lost your way.

00:10:12.212 --> 00:10:13.512
Actually you are not going deeper.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:17.842
You are spreading outside more and more.

00:10:17.842 --> 00:10:22.412
And then once you start going to extremes
because of your freedom you lose your way.

00:10:22.412 --> 00:10:28.592
That’s how today everybody is saying, “A
shock is going to come”.

00:10:28.592 --> 00:10:31.692
You are all going to face a shock.

00:10:31.692 --> 00:10:34.722
This is going to happen, that is going to
happen.

00:10:34.722 --> 00:10:40.182
But actually it is absolutely in your hands
because the whole of the cosmos is within

00:10:40.182 --> 00:10:41.182
you.

00:10:41.182 --> 00:10:45.902
The cosmos is working under your control complete.

00:10:45.902 --> 00:10:49.721
It is absolutely looking after you.

00:10:49.721 --> 00:10:58.312
Every element is looking after you to preserve
you, to guide you, to take you to the right

00:10:58.312 --> 00:10:59.312
thinking.

00:10:59.312 --> 00:11:01.592
But in your freedom you have to achieve that.

00:11:01.592 --> 00:11:06.922
This is a very big condition and there where
we fail to understand.

00:11:06.922 --> 00:11:11.751
Even there are many who say, “There is nothing
like Divine” and, “There is nothing like

00:11:11.751 --> 00:11:13.981
God.”

00:11:13.981 --> 00:11:18.341
In Russia I’ve been and I’ve been to China
and all the communist countries and they are

00:11:18.341 --> 00:11:21.602
in a way partially justify it.

00:11:21.602 --> 00:11:29.122
Because what they found, those people who
talk of God, those who say that, “We believe

00:11:29.122 --> 00:11:36.922
in God” and those who say that, “We believe
in religion”, can be irreligious.

00:11:36.922 --> 00:11:42.832
Anybody who can call himself a Christian,
Hindu, Muslim, say, Farsi, anything, is capable

00:11:42.832 --> 00:11:44.152
of any sin.

00:11:44.152 --> 00:11:48.192
Whatever he wants to do he can do it.

00:11:48.192 --> 00:11:54.342
Nobody can say that, “Because he was a Christian
he could not do it”.

00:11:54.342 --> 00:12:03.582
So the whole concept of religion becomes a
mental projection again an artificial thing.

00:12:03.582 --> 00:12:13.682
But if a person is a Self-Realized person
he goes beyond that, beyond temptations, beyond

00:12:13.682 --> 00:12:17.282
any kind of domination of any habits.

00:12:17.282 --> 00:12:25.102
He becomes a very strong person, very powerful
person and extremely compassionate.

00:12:25.102 --> 00:12:29.732
His compassion is active.

00:12:29.732 --> 00:12:34.192
Is not a compassion that, “I’ll form a
charitable institution, which lends money

00:12:34.192 --> 00:12:38.162
to people”, is not like that.

00:12:38.162 --> 00:12:46.112
The being itself emits compassion and this
compassion acts, acts and works out.

00:12:46.112 --> 00:12:52.352
For example you become like a light which
gives light to people and to yourself.

00:12:52.352 --> 00:12:54.202
You know others and you know yourself.

00:12:54.202 --> 00:13:00.162
That is the light of the Truth and unless
and until that happens one should not say

00:13:00.162 --> 00:13:08.142
that, “I’m a Self-Realized soul” or,
“I am a twice born” – is artificial.

00:13:08.142 --> 00:13:15.402
So what you have to understand that we are
living in a relative world.

00:13:15.402 --> 00:13:18.482
We talk relatively.

00:13:18.482 --> 00:13:24.542
We have to be in the absolute world, where
the Truth is absolute.

00:13:24.542 --> 00:13:30.371
There now before you I’m standing, you know
very well that I’m wearing a sari, which

00:13:30.371 --> 00:13:31.601
is white.

00:13:31.601 --> 00:13:37.432
But it’s a relative still because somebody
will say, “Oh, maybe it’s white”.

00:13:37.432 --> 00:13:41.972
Somebody will say, “It’s of white”,
somebody will say like that.

00:13:41.972 --> 00:13:52.221
Still you know something, but to know it absolutely,
meticulously the right thing, you have to

00:13:52.221 --> 00:13:53.221
be the Spirit.

00:13:53.221 --> 00:13:58.922
But what you know is much more than these
eyes can see or this nose can smell.

00:13:58.922 --> 00:14:07.912
Is much more, much more explicit, much more
clear cut.

00:14:07.912 --> 00:14:10.822
Like a person who is suffering, say, from
some disease.

00:14:10.822 --> 00:14:19.152
A child is suffering from some disease and
they don’t know what the disease is.

00:14:19.152 --> 00:14:26.402
So they have to go many various kinds of tests
and for that the gentlemen, the father, or

00:14:26.402 --> 00:14:29.232
the mother, they have to pay a lot of money.

00:14:29.232 --> 00:14:32.842
They go on finding about the child, what’s
wrong, what’s wrong, what’s wrong.

00:14:32.842 --> 00:14:35.052
They can not find it, what’s wrong with
the child.

00:14:35.052 --> 00:14:40.912
And they are so upset about it and within
three days a child dies and still the diagnoses

00:14:40.912 --> 00:14:41.912
is not coming.

00:14:41.912 --> 00:14:45.952
Is a very common thing.

00:14:45.952 --> 00:14:52.342
But when you are a Self-Realized soul you
can know what’s wrong with the child, exactly

00:14:52.342 --> 00:15:00.312
you can put down your finger on the problem
that he has.

00:15:00.312 --> 00:15:01.312
Now how does it happen?

00:15:01.312 --> 00:15:06.312
Here is already told you about the charkas
that we have, the centers within us.

00:15:06.312 --> 00:15:13.652
These are the centers, which on one side control
the cosmos, on the other side control us,

00:15:13.652 --> 00:15:19.432
give knowledge and on the other side they
give us the knowledge about others.

00:15:19.432 --> 00:15:20.832
These centers are within us.

00:15:20.832 --> 00:15:27.101
Now when I’m telling you all this you have
to have an open mind of a scientist.

00:15:27.101 --> 00:15:31.682
We shouldn’t just deny it because in your
concept it doesn’t fitting.

00:15:31.682 --> 00:15:38.472
But like a scientist please see to it that
if it is proved you have to accept that this

00:15:38.472 --> 00:15:40.402
is so.

00:15:40.402 --> 00:15:46.692
Now these charkas are within you, these centers
are within you, and these centers communicate

00:15:46.692 --> 00:15:53.981
to you through your fingertips what’s the
matter with a child.

00:15:53.981 --> 00:15:59.372
You can feel it on your fingertips, now five,
six, and seven centers, right side, seven

00:15:59.372 --> 00:16:00.372
centers.

00:16:00.372 --> 00:16:01.522
(Shri Mataji points to the chakra projections
on Her left and right palms.)

00:16:01.522 --> 00:16:05.652
The right side has got the seven centers,
if they are decoded properly and if you know

00:16:05.652 --> 00:16:09.972
what is the decoding is, putting the hand
towards a child, for a Realized soul it is

00:16:09.972 --> 00:16:11.342
very easy to see where is the problem.

00:16:11.342 --> 00:16:18.851
And as soon as he finds a problem and he knows
how to cure it he can cure people without

00:16:18.851 --> 00:16:19.851
going to doctors.

00:16:19.851 --> 00:16:26.302
Sahaja Yoga has cured, I must say, I don’t
want to claim it because I don’t want to

00:16:26.302 --> 00:16:29.922
open a hospital.

00:16:29.922 --> 00:16:33.722
We are here to create doctors and not patients.

00:16:33.722 --> 00:16:38.452
So even some patients who have come to us
have become doctors today in a way that they

00:16:38.452 --> 00:16:41.412
diagnose it on their fingertips.

00:16:41.412 --> 00:16:49.122
As Mohammed Sahib has clearly said that, “At
the time of your resurrection your hands will

00:16:49.122 --> 00:16:50.122
speak”.

00:16:50.122 --> 00:16:56.172
But still nobody wants to know about it, that’s
called as a resurrection time, as [SOUNDS

00:16:56.172 --> 00:16:58.172
LIKE – Kayama], nobody wants to talk about
it.

00:16:58.172 --> 00:17:03.442
“Your hands will speak and will give evidence
and witness against you”, clearly He has

00:17:03.442 --> 00:17:11.692
said it, I must say, He’d done such a lot
of work on the Self-knowledge; as Christ has

00:17:11.692 --> 00:17:15.272
also said so many things.

00:17:15.272 --> 00:17:18.282
But people don’t want to look at that side.

00:17:18.282 --> 00:17:26.952
Like to say that, “We must suffer” itself
is a nonsense, I think, how can you.

00:17:26.952 --> 00:17:34.231
Any God who is a compassionate Father would
like His children to suffer to meet Him?

00:17:34.231 --> 00:17:37.851
I mean, it doesn’t going to logic at all.

00:17:37.851 --> 00:17:42.542
But people accept this funny concept of sufferings.

00:17:42.542 --> 00:17:43.722
What about Christ?

00:17:43.722 --> 00:17:46.012
He suffered for us, isn’t it?

00:17:46.012 --> 00:17:49.732
Isn’t it that He suffered for us?

00:17:49.732 --> 00:17:55.092
If so, is has He left something for us to
be done, to be completed more than He has

00:17:55.092 --> 00:17:58.091
suffered?

00:17:58.091 --> 00:18:08.812
He has suffered for us and He has done the
job fully.

00:18:08.812 --> 00:18:15.482
We don’t have to do any more about it.

00:18:15.482 --> 00:18:18.702
He carried the cross.

00:18:18.702 --> 00:18:24.522
People make Him look like a TB patient, even
worse than that, just bones and the skins.

00:18:24.522 --> 00:18:31.332
It’s very surprising, how can you conceive
Christ like that?!

00:18:31.332 --> 00:18:40.741
Anyone of the people who say they are very
healthy people, let them carry the cross and

00:18:40.741 --> 00:18:42.461
we’ll see.

00:18:42.461 --> 00:18:51.721
It is so contradictory about Christ, there’s
surprisingly that He should say that you have

00:18:51.721 --> 00:18:55.042
to suffer.

00:18:55.042 --> 00:18:56.042
Same about Jews.

00:18:56.042 --> 00:19:03.342
I just don’t understand why should they
say that you have to suffer if their God is

00:19:03.342 --> 00:19:04.342
kind?

00:19:04.342 --> 00:19:12.062
Same about all other organized; all these
organized or perverted people who say that

00:19:12.062 --> 00:19:14.532
you have to suffer.

00:19:14.532 --> 00:19:18.242
Suddenly people become vegetarians, suddenly
they become fasting.

00:19:18.242 --> 00:19:22.742
In India though we have to fast in any case
because of lack of food, but they have fasting

00:19:22.742 --> 00:19:23.742
days.

00:19:23.742 --> 00:19:27.672
There are some people who fast at least five
days in a week.

00:19:27.672 --> 00:19:28.672
They fasting.

00:19:28.672 --> 00:19:29.672
What is the need to fast?

00:19:29.672 --> 00:19:31.712
If you ask for fasting you’ll have to fast
all your life.

00:19:31.712 --> 00:19:35.032
That’s what God gives you, “You fast now,
you want to fast?

00:19:35.032 --> 00:19:37.652
All right, have it fasting.”

00:19:37.652 --> 00:19:40.372
We are asking for trouble.

00:19:40.372 --> 00:19:41.782
You want to be miserable?

00:19:41.782 --> 00:19:44.802
All right, be miserable.

00:19:44.802 --> 00:19:45.852
You want to be unhappy?

00:19:45.852 --> 00:19:47.972
All right, be unhappy.

00:19:47.972 --> 00:19:54.642
You find people coming out of congregations,
which are supposed to be very religious so

00:19:54.642 --> 00:19:56.152
miserable looking.

00:19:56.152 --> 00:19:57.422
How can it be?

00:19:57.422 --> 00:20:03.642
It has to be joy, it has to be happiness.

00:20:03.642 --> 00:20:09.982
Just think of it, how can we ever believe
such things what we have believed for ages,

00:20:09.982 --> 00:20:16.342
ages, ages, and it can not go out of our heads,
that we have to suffer.

00:20:16.342 --> 00:20:21.162
How long, how many years, how many lives?

00:20:21.162 --> 00:20:23.162
Nothing is written anywhere.

00:20:23.162 --> 00:20:29.182
You better go on suffering and make others
suffer also with it.

00:20:29.182 --> 00:20:34.652
If some person is like that in your family
you’d like to run away with that boredom,

00:20:34.652 --> 00:20:37.502
because he’s suffering for nothing at all
and (Shri Mataji laughs) he don’t understand

00:20:37.502 --> 00:20:38.702
why is he suffering.

00:20:38.702 --> 00:20:41.562
So you want to run away from such a person.

00:20:41.562 --> 00:20:48.012
And all this kind of ideas we have accepted
for ages now.

00:20:48.012 --> 00:20:51.592
And that has led us to a big confusion about
God.

00:20:51.592 --> 00:20:56.012
Then we take to things which give us joy.

00:20:56.012 --> 00:21:01.692
Actually they are not, they are just flippant
pleasures.

00:21:01.692 --> 00:21:04.703
We can not enjoy anything in life, really
we can not.

00:21:04.703 --> 00:21:09.062
We can see the way people are now going on
for such sensational things.

00:21:09.062 --> 00:21:11.142
The reason is there’s no joy.

00:21:11.142 --> 00:21:17.972
The sensitivity to joy is so reduced that
I sometimes fear with all that they are doing

00:21:17.972 --> 00:21:23.132
they so fed up, that they may have to put
electrodes in the limbic area to get the joy

00:21:23.132 --> 00:21:25.642
instead.

00:21:25.642 --> 00:21:34.662
They have become so very (Shri Mataji smiles)
so very insensitive to anything, they’ll

00:21:34.662 --> 00:21:42.572
not laugh, they’ll not smile, they are so
full of closed hearts and frightened things,

00:21:42.572 --> 00:21:45.202
whatever they said about humane beings.

00:21:45.202 --> 00:21:56.132
Now first thing you have to know – you don’t
have to suffer at all.

00:21:56.132 --> 00:21:57.622
Secondly, you don’t have to judge yourself.

00:21:57.622 --> 00:21:59.732
Let your Kundalini rise and judge you.

00:21:59.732 --> 00:22:01.192
You don’t start judging yourself and condemning
yourself.

00:22:01.192 --> 00:22:07.362
And the another fashion, which is very common,
is to feel guilty.

00:22:07.362 --> 00:22:11.972
From the very beginning you start, “I am
afraid”.

00:22:11.972 --> 00:22:15.022
What are you afraid of?

00:22:15.022 --> 00:22:22.242
You have to have all the courage, all the
blessings, and all the confidence.

00:22:22.242 --> 00:22:28.922
You are a humane being and this is the message
I want to tell you that you are a humane being

00:22:28.922 --> 00:22:31.022
and you have to be the Spirit.

00:22:31.022 --> 00:22:35.712
And once you are the Spirit you’ll be surprised
the blessings will be showering upon you.

00:22:35.712 --> 00:22:39.652
In these modern times should talk about these
things is out of date.

00:22:39.652 --> 00:22:44.032
But it is predicted that this will be said
and this will be done.

00:22:44.032 --> 00:22:52.822
For us it is important first of all to know
our own glory, our own truths, and about how

00:22:52.822 --> 00:22:56.232
we are built and how others are built.

00:22:56.232 --> 00:23:02.062
Once you know that first of all the peace
within is established.

00:23:02.062 --> 00:23:08.202
Unless and until there is peace within what
do you talk of this peace organization and

00:23:08.202 --> 00:23:10.092
Peace Nobel Prize?

00:23:10.092 --> 00:23:19.792
I’ve seen the people who have gotten Nobel
Prizes are the most hot-headed so much that

00:23:19.792 --> 00:23:24.242
you have to talk to them with a barge pole
in between.

00:23:24.242 --> 00:23:29.522
Any time they are up to jump on you, you can
not challenge them; even talking to them is

00:23:29.522 --> 00:23:31.792
a difficult situation.

00:23:31.792 --> 00:23:38.412
So how are they going to have this peace foundation
when they are themselves so shaking?

00:23:38.412 --> 00:23:43.872
Then you have other things talking about – the
love, the love.

00:23:43.872 --> 00:23:47.092
Full of lust and greed.

00:23:47.092 --> 00:23:51.712
They love your purse, not you.

00:23:51.712 --> 00:23:58.542
When you talk of love, love is a thing that’s
detached.

00:23:58.542 --> 00:24:06.032
Like the sap in the tree rises, goes to all
the leaves, all the trunk, all the flowers,

00:24:06.032 --> 00:24:08.712
all the fruits and comes back, is not attached.

00:24:08.712 --> 00:24:17.292
If it’s get attached to one fruit the tree
will die and the fruit will die too.

00:24:17.292 --> 00:24:24.472
So this Pure Love or the Divine Love is detached,
that’s why it acts, it works.

00:24:24.472 --> 00:24:33.592
A person who is a Realized soul is such a
pure personality that even a glance of such

00:24:33.592 --> 00:24:37.292
a person can do lots of things.

00:24:37.292 --> 00:24:45.432
Even a thought of such a person in the attention
can do so many things, bring about so many

00:24:45.432 --> 00:24:46.432
changes.

00:24:46.432 --> 00:24:49.642
So this is the time of our transformation.

00:24:49.642 --> 00:24:58.272
We have to become a higher personality; the
transformation has to take place.

00:24:58.272 --> 00:25:03.912
At the time of Easter we give people eggs.

00:25:03.912 --> 00:25:09.112
Perhaps people do not know why do we give
them eggs at the time of Easter.

00:25:09.112 --> 00:25:14.632
But about Christ is written in our Scriptures
that He was an egg to begin with.

00:25:14.632 --> 00:25:21.522
Of course, He was much more before that, but
to begin with He was the God of innocence.

00:25:21.522 --> 00:25:26.242
But then He came as an egg.

00:25:26.242 --> 00:25:29.122
And then He was divided into two halves.

00:25:29.122 --> 00:25:36.962
The one half, which incarnated, and which
transformed this Earth.

00:25:36.962 --> 00:25:40.282
So the resurrection is the transformation.

00:25:40.282 --> 00:25:49.812
Like an egg, if we are bound by our conditioning
and by our ego, we break through that shell

00:25:49.812 --> 00:25:52.862
and become a bird, which is really a free
bird.

00:25:52.862 --> 00:25:56.102
Only thing, the bird has to know how to fly.

00:25:56.102 --> 00:26:04.182
Now this is, again I’m saying is the living
process of the living nature, of the living

00:26:04.182 --> 00:26:05.562
Power of Love.

00:26:05.562 --> 00:26:08.062
It is not something artificial.

00:26:08.062 --> 00:26:15.822
In Sahaja Yoga, I must have spoken in this
hall I don’t know how many times might before

00:26:15.822 --> 00:26:19.872
and again today there’s a chance to speak
to you.

00:26:19.872 --> 00:26:25.062
What I have to say, that it is important the
becoming.

00:26:25.062 --> 00:26:31.272
Is not important: you can not become a member
of Sahaj Yog, you can not pay membership,

00:26:31.272 --> 00:26:32.912
you can not pay for your Realization.

00:26:32.912 --> 00:26:33.922
How can you pay?

00:26:33.922 --> 00:26:40.342
How much do we pay to the Mother Earth to
sprout the seed, does She understand?

00:26:40.342 --> 00:26:45.692
Because She has the power She sprouts the
seed.

00:26:45.692 --> 00:26:53.372
If you give Her money or read something before
Her, it makes no difference.

00:26:53.372 --> 00:26:58.782
But once you get your Realization you start
understanding how many powers you have.

00:26:58.782 --> 00:27:05.972
And the greatest power is of compassion and
detached love.

00:27:05.972 --> 00:27:10.782
These seven chakras are within us, which are
to be enlightened by the awakening of the

00:27:10.782 --> 00:27:14.262
Kundalini about which Dr. Spiro has already
told you.

00:27:14.262 --> 00:27:18.872
Now in this short time I can not cover up
the whole subject.

00:27:18.872 --> 00:27:23.442
I must have given at least more than thousand
lectures in English language.

00:27:23.442 --> 00:27:31.312
But I would request you one thing that forget
about what you have learned so far.

00:27:31.312 --> 00:27:39.162
About your conditionings because if you had
achieved anything out of that I was not necessary.

00:27:39.162 --> 00:27:48.242
Now you have to see with a clean slate, as
they say, what you can achieve in this lifetime,

00:27:48.242 --> 00:27:52.112
which is the most important thing, is to be
achieved.

00:27:52.112 --> 00:28:01.482
Of course, where’s a lot of things that
should really make you more tempting about

00:28:01.482 --> 00:28:02.532
it.

00:28:02.532 --> 00:28:06.042
Firstly, that you get rid of all your illnesses.

00:28:06.042 --> 00:28:14.152
Most of the illnesses can be cured – if
they are at an early stage – by Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:14.152 --> 00:28:20.402
Most of the mental illnesses can be cured
with Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:20.402 --> 00:28:25.462
Your material problems can be solved by Sahaja
Yoga.

00:28:25.462 --> 00:28:30.572
Your spiritual problems like going to wrong
gurus and wrong people whatever you have accumulated

00:28:30.572 --> 00:28:32.522
within you can be corrected.

00:28:32.522 --> 00:28:39.752
But the highest of all that you become sensitive
to joy.

00:28:39.752 --> 00:28:42.362
Then you start seeing joy in everything.

00:28:42.362 --> 00:28:46.842
You don’t have to think that, “Oh, this
is the thing which is marvelous”.

00:28:46.842 --> 00:28:47.842
No.

00:28:47.842 --> 00:28:51.762
It just happens, you see it is.

00:28:51.762 --> 00:28:56.412
Just you enjoy without thinking about it.

00:28:56.412 --> 00:28:58.422
You become a peaceful personality.

00:28:58.422 --> 00:29:00.842
You become a dynamic personality.

00:29:00.842 --> 00:29:07.492
Your are not spade by other veils of things,
like some fashion coming up, then some sort

00:29:07.492 --> 00:29:12.952
of a nonsensical idea coming up, then some
medicine coming up and you treating yourself

00:29:12.952 --> 00:29:14.822
and getting to trouble.

00:29:14.822 --> 00:29:19.122
You just rise above all the these things at
a higher level and you start see everything

00:29:19.122 --> 00:29:21.112
as a witness.

00:29:21.112 --> 00:29:27.392
You become the witness of all the jokes that
are going on and you just watch it and you

00:29:27.392 --> 00:29:30.072
think, “What’s all this?

00:29:30.072 --> 00:29:32.862
Is just a play”.

00:29:32.862 --> 00:29:37.592
Many people have said that, “Mother, You
always laugh so much and You have always smiling

00:29:37.592 --> 00:29:40.422
face, so the people are not going to take
You seriously”.

00:29:40.422 --> 00:29:43.732
I said, “I don’t want them to be serious”.

00:29:43.732 --> 00:29:45.112
There’s not going to be any seriousness
needed.

00:29:45.112 --> 00:29:47.942
What are you serious about?

00:29:47.942 --> 00:29:50.252
You should be happy.

00:29:50.252 --> 00:29:51.342
It’s fun.

00:29:51.342 --> 00:29:53.552
We have to be happy people.

00:29:53.552 --> 00:29:54.562
We have to be happy.

00:29:54.562 --> 00:30:00.622
Most people who think, they are very guilty,
should punish themselves by saying, “You

00:30:00.622 --> 00:30:03.032
are not guilty, you are not guilty” 108
times.

00:30:03.032 --> 00:30:06.082
That’s what we have in Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:06.082 --> 00:30:07.082
Is just the myth.

00:30:07.082 --> 00:30:12.802
All these are myths; we are working with myths
and making our lives miserable, which is meant

00:30:12.802 --> 00:30:20.482
to be joy, happiness and all the overflowing
blessings of the Divine.

00:30:20.482 --> 00:30:28.592
Whatever I’m telling you about we have within
ourselves all the great powers hidden of our

00:30:28.592 --> 00:30:35.162
brain, of our liver, of our heart, – they
are to be enlightened.

00:30:35.162 --> 00:30:36.202
And then in the light you see everything.

00:30:36.202 --> 00:30:42.952
But as in this room you have so many lights
you have to just push in one button and the

00:30:42.952 --> 00:30:44.002
whole thing comes out.

00:30:44.002 --> 00:30:45.682
In the same way it happens.

00:30:45.682 --> 00:30:51.112
But if I start telling you about the history
of electricity in the dark and all about how

00:30:51.112 --> 00:30:56.512
it came here and what all happened, you’d
be just fed up with it.

00:30:56.512 --> 00:31:02.012
So what we are doing is to tell you that let
us put on the button first, you better have

00:31:02.012 --> 00:31:06.292
your light and see in that light if it is
true or not.

00:31:06.292 --> 00:31:11.882
If it is true you have to understand and accept
it honestly.

00:31:11.882 --> 00:31:17.002
You have to be honest to yourself that is
the main point I’m trying to tell you.

00:31:17.002 --> 00:31:21.312
We are not to play about with ourselves and
play about with our conditionings.

00:31:21.312 --> 00:31:26.702
We have to be honest and to get to our properties
that are within our selves.

00:31:26.702 --> 00:31:30.102
I’m not here to oblige you at all, there’s
no obligation.

00:31:30.102 --> 00:31:35.762
Is just like a catalyst, I would say, and
you become the catalyst oneself once you get

00:31:35.762 --> 00:31:36.872
your Realization.

00:31:36.872 --> 00:31:43.112
And you can do all that I can do, it’s very
easy and very simple.

00:31:43.112 --> 00:31:47.222
May God bless you all.

00:31:47.222 --> 00:31:48.222
(Aside) Now, should we have questions or what?

00:31:48.222 --> 00:31:49.222
I find most of you were just ready for getting
Self-Realization.

00:31:49.222 --> 00:31:51.792
Not only that, but I think you all capable
of that.

00:31:51.792 --> 00:32:39.772
But still there must be some people who must
be want to ask questions.

00:32:39.772 --> 00:32:44.332
I would only request – don’t be aggressive
with Me, there’s no need.

00:32:44.332 --> 00:32:50.702
I’ve not come here for votes, nor for any
money, nor for anything.

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:55.522
I’ve just come here to give you your own
keys.

00:32:55.522 --> 00:32:58.872
Out of Love that I am.

00:32:58.872 --> 00:33:02.652
So please try to understand Me.

00:33:02.652 --> 00:33:07.672
I’m not here to take, I mean, anything from
you.

00:33:07.672 --> 00:33:14.802
Just to show you what you are and you’ll
be happy to know that you are something great.

00:33:14.802 --> 00:33:22.652
So may God bless you, I would like you to
ask Me questions related to Self-Realization

00:33:22.652 --> 00:33:27.742
and not to waste the time of so many who look
so anxious to have their Self-Realization.

00:33:27.742 --> 00:33:35.782
Those who do not want to do any meditation
after this, which will take hardly ten minutes

00:33:35.782 --> 00:33:40.601
for you to get your Realization, because the
journey is three to four feet only – from

00:33:40.601 --> 00:33:41.601
here to here.

00:33:41.601 --> 00:33:44.922
(Shri Mataji shows the distance from Mooladhar
to Sahasrara Chakra with Her hand.)

00:33:44.922 --> 00:33:45.922
That’s all.

00:33:45.922 --> 00:33:50.462
So, I would just say, that you will all get
your Realization in no time.

00:33:50.462 --> 00:33:55.882
Should get your Realization, but do not try
to be uncivil.

00:33:55.882 --> 00:34:00.532
If you do not want to have it, you should
leave the hall and leave others in peace.

00:34:00.532 --> 00:34:02.652
That would be very kind of us.

00:34:02.652 --> 00:34:07.422
And not to see and watch, we don’t need
such people here.

00:34:07.422 --> 00:34:13.022
Those who want to have Realization can sit
down or others have freedom to go, but not

00:34:13.022 --> 00:34:14.162
freedom to sit here.

00:34:14.162 --> 00:34:23.952
So I would request you to be kind and civil
to others who want to receive their Realization.

00:34:23.952 --> 00:34:28.432
Any questions, please.

00:34:28.432 --> 00:34:32.902
Q.: [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:34:32.902 --> 00:34:35.892
What’s it?

00:34:35.892 --> 00:35:03.492
A Sahaja Yogi: Mother, he said that Dr. Spiro
couldn’t complete his talk about how the

00:35:03.492 --> 00:35:06.382
germinating principle works.

00:35:06.382 --> 00:35:11.432
Could You say something to finish of what
he said?

00:35:11.432 --> 00:35:13.351
Shri Mataji: Generating principle?

00:35:13.351 --> 00:35:14.422
The Sahaja Yogi: Germinating.

00:35:14.422 --> 00:35:17.172
Shri Mataji: You see, it is, I would say,
it is spontaneous.

00:35:17.172 --> 00:35:28.602
Now that should explain a little bit how does
a seed germinate.

00:35:28.602 --> 00:35:33.002
You have the seed and you put it in the Mother
Earth, all right?

00:35:33.002 --> 00:35:39.532
And it germinates because it’s all built
in it, this is all built in it, all this is

00:35:39.532 --> 00:35:40.691
built in it.

00:35:40.691 --> 00:35:47.262
And in the triangular bone you have got this
Kundalini, which is placed within you in 3,5

00:35:47.262 --> 00:35:49.782
coils of an energy, which is a residual energy.

00:35:49.782 --> 00:35:58.932
Which is actually the power of your pure desire.

00:35:58.932 --> 00:36:03.752
Because the desire that we have otherwise,
all the desires, are not pure.

00:36:03.752 --> 00:36:07.552
What’s why they are not satiable in general.

00:36:07.552 --> 00:36:09.762
We get one thing, we want to have another.

00:36:09.762 --> 00:36:12.701
We get the another thing, you want to have
the third thing.

00:36:12.701 --> 00:36:18.121
So this is the power of pure desire.

00:36:18.121 --> 00:36:27.411
And this pure desire is described in the Bible
as Holy Ghost, in the Koran as [SOUNDS LIKE

00:36:27.411 --> 00:36:36.722
– Asas] and in the Indian Scriptures as
Adi Shakti, as the Primordial Mother.

00:36:36.722 --> 00:36:42.922
So She is the power of God as called as the
Primordial Mother.

00:36:42.922 --> 00:36:50.911
Now this Primordial Mother is settled in our
triangular bone while the Spirit which is

00:36:50.911 --> 00:36:54.682
the reflection of God Almighty is in our heart.

00:36:54.682 --> 00:37:04.142
But the seat of the heart is on top of your
head – here – on the fontanel bone area,

00:37:04.142 --> 00:37:07.702
which is called as Brahmarandra in Sanskrit
language.

00:37:07.702 --> 00:37:14.782
And also when we talk of baptism we try to
bless there, but it’s artificial.

00:37:14.782 --> 00:37:23.172
Real baptism is when this Kundalini, which
is the Holy Ghost or the Adi Shakti, the reflection

00:37:23.172 --> 00:37:30.362
of that, rises within you piercing through
these centers, piercing through the fontanel

00:37:30.362 --> 00:37:39.042
bone area and actualizes the experience of
this personal experience and gives you a cool

00:37:39.042 --> 00:37:41.032
breeze coming out of your head.

00:37:41.032 --> 00:37:45.172
Actually the cool breeze coming out of your
head, you feel it, and then you feel it everywhere,

00:37:45.172 --> 00:37:49.182
the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost.

00:37:49.182 --> 00:37:57.062
And that is the subtle of the subtlest, which
is the syntheses of all the powers, which

00:37:57.062 --> 00:37:59.512
works everything out.

00:37:59.512 --> 00:38:06.752
Like you can say, in the sulfur dioxide we
have in the molecule of the sulfur dioxide

00:38:06.752 --> 00:38:09.272
we find that there is pulsation of the vibrations.

00:38:09.272 --> 00:38:11.882
Who does what?

00:38:11.882 --> 00:38:13.942
We say electromagnetic.

00:38:13.942 --> 00:38:18.392
But the electromagnetic is one part of the
same power.

00:38:18.392 --> 00:38:22.342
So this power we can broadly divide into three
things.

00:38:22.342 --> 00:38:28.202
In the first power what we call as the power
by which we desire.

00:38:28.202 --> 00:38:36.692
The second power by which we act and the third
power by which we ascend.

00:38:36.692 --> 00:38:48.112
All the synthesis of all these powers, all
these powers are in this Kundalini which meets

00:38:48.112 --> 00:38:54.072
the Spirit because the seat of the Spirit,
as they call the Pitha, is on top of your

00:38:54.072 --> 00:38:59.642
head and that’s how the whole attention
you can see like a sari it is supposing the

00:38:59.642 --> 00:39:04.401
attention is spread here and the Kundalini
rises, rises like that (Shri Mataji puts Her

00:39:04.401 --> 00:39:06.173
finger under the sari on Her chest and erects
it like a tent pole), pierces through this

00:39:06.173 --> 00:39:08.972
at and the whole of this attention becomes
enlightened.

00:39:08.972 --> 00:39:12.492
That’s how your attention becomes enlightened.

00:39:12.492 --> 00:39:14.242
This is in short I’m telling you.

00:39:14.242 --> 00:39:20.942
But as I told you we have got My lectures
on all detailed way how it works out, it’s

00:39:20.942 --> 00:39:22.202
quite a detailed thing.

00:39:22.202 --> 00:39:25.332
But in the first lecture it will be quite
boring for you.

00:39:25.332 --> 00:39:30.532
So I think I better tell you this much, that
it’s a spontaneous happening and can happen

00:39:30.532 --> 00:39:53.632
to all of you.

00:39:53.632 --> 00:40:10.952
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:40:10.952 --> 00:40:11.952
The Sahaja Yogi: Do the first stages in Sahaja
Yoga consist of meditation and how they beneficial

00:40:11.952 --> 00:40:12.952
physiological changes?

00:40:12.952 --> 00:40:15.312
Shri Mataji: No, it is, you see, we do not
understand the meaning of meditation actually.

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:19.982
You are not to meditate, but you are in meditation
in Sahaja Yoga.

00:40:19.982 --> 00:40:21.902
You become meditative by temperament.

00:40:21.902 --> 00:40:27.322
Now, I would suggest like this that in the
beginning why I said you have to meditate,

00:40:27.322 --> 00:40:31.992
because I would like to tell you actually
that word is not so suitable, but I said that

00:40:31.992 --> 00:40:39.042
you have to little bit cooperate with Me how
to help your Kundalini to rise.

00:40:39.042 --> 00:40:44.262
That’s the process we are going to have
in a very simple words.

00:40:44.262 --> 00:40:49.462
But I said meditate because that’s all could
make the smaller way of saying things.

00:40:49.462 --> 00:40:55.492
But actually in Sahaja Yoga the practice of
Sahaja Yoga is very different from any kind

00:40:55.492 --> 00:40:59.072
of meditation, of concentration or anything.

00:40:59.072 --> 00:41:05.312
There are very simple ways by which you have
to correct your left or right side and to

00:41:05.312 --> 00:41:07.901
be in the center.

00:41:07.901 --> 00:41:10.732
And then when you are in the center the growth
take place.

00:41:10.732 --> 00:41:17.062
Is very simple and luckily we are going to
have next Thursday a very good workshop where

00:41:17.062 --> 00:41:20.352
they will tell you all the details how it
has to be done.

00:41:20.352 --> 00:41:24.462
And they’ll solve all your questions and
all your problems there.

00:41:24.462 --> 00:41:31.642
And lots of people are going to be in that
place where you’ll find solutions to all

00:41:31.642 --> 00:41:39.332
these questions you ask.

00:41:39.332 --> 00:41:58.552
Thursday they are going to have a very good
workshop.

00:41:58.552 --> 00:42:04.322
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:42:04.322 --> 00:42:19.472
Shri Mataji: [YES or FIRST], sickness can
be cured if you become Self-Realized.

00:42:19.472 --> 00:42:23.832
Actually you don’t go to doctors then anymore,
you become a doctor yourself.

00:42:23.832 --> 00:42:28.312
So the physical sufferings can be, this [NOT
AUDIBLE – way ?]. Now the collective suffering

00:42:28.312 --> 00:42:34.222
comes by the stupidity of humane beings, by
the ego of humane beings, of wrong ideas,

00:42:34.222 --> 00:42:35.302
you see.

00:42:35.302 --> 00:42:41.362
Like a Hindu fighting a Sikh and a Muslim
fighting a Muslim and a Christian fighting

00:42:41.362 --> 00:42:44.312
the Jews or all the sorts of nonsense.

00:42:44.312 --> 00:42:49.772
And also the capitalist fighting the communists.

00:42:49.772 --> 00:42:54.411
Actually I should say I’m a capitalist because
I have certain powers and I’m the greatest

00:42:54.411 --> 00:42:55.612
communist because I must distribute it.

00:42:55.612 --> 00:42:59.332
This is the real power which has to be distributed.

00:42:59.332 --> 00:43:01.581
What is the money power to be distributed?

00:43:01.581 --> 00:43:02.581
– Useless thing.

00:43:02.581 --> 00:43:04.342
Money doesn’t give you any sense.

00:43:04.342 --> 00:43:10.351
So is the combination of everything, the synthesis
of everything you’ll find and that’s how

00:43:10.351 --> 00:43:14.282
you are surprised that the sufferings just
disappear.

00:43:14.282 --> 00:43:21.952
Also now you might say that, “What about
the sufferings of the nature?”

00:43:21.952 --> 00:43:30.122
People who are Realized souls never get those
suffering things because you see this full

00:43:30.122 --> 00:43:35.482
cosmos is within them, they are looked after.

00:43:35.482 --> 00:43:39.122
This is at a humane awareness.

00:43:39.122 --> 00:43:43.151
But at the spiritual awareness you become
beyond sufferings.

00:43:43.151 --> 00:43:49.252
And Christ is to be awakened within you, that’s
the points is.

00:43:49.252 --> 00:43:50.732
Because Christ is not awakened within you.

00:43:50.732 --> 00:43:59.882
When the Christ, you know, in this chakra
– this center is Agya chakra, here – is

00:43:59.882 --> 00:44:02.662
bestowed the Deity of Christ.

00:44:02.662 --> 00:44:08.222
Now here if you can see in the map there is
they have shown on one side the ego, another

00:44:08.222 --> 00:44:11.612
side – the superego, means the conditioning.

00:44:11.612 --> 00:44:19.552
Now when this chakra is awakened meaning the
Christ within us is awakened, then He sucks

00:44:19.552 --> 00:44:20.812
in our karmas.

00:44:20.812 --> 00:44:25.402
That’s why they say that He died for our
sins.

00:44:25.402 --> 00:44:31.392
Then He also sucks in our conditioning, both
the things.

00:44:31.392 --> 00:44:42.282
He is placed in the middle of the brain you
can say where is the optic chaisma crossing

00:44:42.282 --> 00:44:48.072
and He looks after the pituitary and the pineal
body.

00:44:48.072 --> 00:44:53.752
That’s how He controls both the things within
us and He sucks in.

00:44:53.752 --> 00:44:57.072
And when He sucks in there’s an opening
that takes place on our fontanel bone area

00:44:57.072 --> 00:44:58.282
and through that then the Kundalini pierces
through.

00:44:58.282 --> 00:44:59.312
Q. [NOT AUDIBLE]

00:44:59.312 --> 00:45:10.342
The Sahaja Yogi: How can you keep your Self-Realization
if you are not in touch with the collective?

00:45:10.342 --> 00:45:26.164
Shri Mataji: You can not.

00:45:26.164 --> 00:45:28.332
You have to keep some connection with the
collective.

00:45:28.332 --> 00:45:31.082
It’s like say nowadays it’s autumn you
have seen.

00:45:31.082 --> 00:45:32.891
In autumn what happens?

00:45:32.891 --> 00:45:40.392
A bark like a cork develops between the leaves
and the tree.

00:45:40.392 --> 00:45:43.462
And such a leaf falls off and dies.

00:45:43.462 --> 00:45:48.302
You have to be in the collective, you can
not keep your Self-Realization without collectivity.

00:45:48.302 --> 00:45:51.432
Is very important to be with the collective.

00:45:51.432 --> 00:45:57.012
This is one point people fail, because they
think they’ll lose their individuality.

00:45:57.012 --> 00:45:58.682
Is a wrong idea.

00:45:58.682 --> 00:46:01.782
Actually when the leaf dies it has no individuality.

00:46:01.782 --> 00:46:07.651
On the contrary, when it is on the tree you’ll
be surprised, that one leaf can not tally

00:46:07.651 --> 00:46:10.392
with another leaf in the whole world.

00:46:10.392 --> 00:46:15.132
Such an individual thing it is.

00:46:15.132 --> 00:46:21.442
It is I would say unity in diversity, complete
unity in diversity.

00:46:21.442 --> 00:46:25.712
Because that is the variety is the one that
gives beauty to this world.

00:46:25.712 --> 00:46:30.612
Otherwise if we are all sort of dressed of
the same way, walking the same way, it will

00:46:30.612 --> 00:46:32.582
be such a boring company.

00:46:47.938 --> 00:46:50.338
Is there any question?

00:46:50.363 --> 00:46:52.490
Such a rapport.

00:46:52.515 --> 00:46:53.982
It’s beautiful people today.

00:46:54.095 --> 00:46:54.838
All right.

00:46:54.855 --> 00:46:59.275
So now, as I’ve requested you, those who
would like to go, should go.

00:46:59.377 --> 00:47:05.507
Because when we do this we all have to close
the eyes and people are not even willing to

00:47:05.507 --> 00:47:06.507
do that.

00:47:06.507 --> 00:47:11.307
So the thing is that the Divine is not going
to fall at out feet, isn’t it?

00:47:11.307 --> 00:47:12.927
We have to be little humble about it.

00:47:12.927 --> 00:47:19.627
If we don’t have that humility is better
we should try other methods and then come

00:47:19.627 --> 00:47:20.967
to Sahaja Yoga.

00:47:20.967 --> 00:47:28.787
Because Sahaja Yoga is not meant for arrogant
people, for people who think knowing of themselves.

00:47:28.787 --> 00:47:41.297
Is meant for people who want to get their
Self-Realization.

00:47:41.297 --> 00:47:49.167
Now a simple thing we have to do, all of us,
which is also sometimes not liked by people

00:47:49.167 --> 00:47:52.977
when I tell them – we have to take out our
shoes.

00:47:52.977 --> 00:47:56.427
Because this Mother Earth is going to help
us a lot.

00:47:56.427 --> 00:47:58.907
She’s the one who is giver of everything.

00:47:58.907 --> 00:48:02.576
So we have to take out our shoes and touch
the Mother Earth.

00:48:02.576 --> 00:48:16.847
You can keep your socks on with your both
the feet.

00:48:27.285 --> 00:48:34.599
Put both the feet separately because there
are two powers separately on the Mother Earth.

00:48:51.192 --> 00:48:56.527
Those who are sitting on the ground are all
right as they are, they need not put their

00:48:56.527 --> 00:49:06.437
feet like this, they can sit in a Sahaja asana,
means in a way that is relaxed, not to put

00:49:06.437 --> 00:49:08.897
legs on top of another row or anything.

00:49:08.897 --> 00:49:11.607
Any stress on your body is not needed.

00:49:11.607 --> 00:49:17.576
You have to be comfortable to be straight,
sitting straight, not putting your neck back

00:49:17.576 --> 00:49:27.296
or forward, just sitting straight, that’s
all.

00:49:27.296 --> 00:49:34.777
One promise has to be there in your heart,
that you will after Realization respect your

00:49:34.777 --> 00:49:43.487
Realization and grow like a tree and should
not be the like the parable of the seeds that

00:49:43.487 --> 00:49:50.027
some seeds fell on a rock and some who sprouted
also got lost.

00:49:50.027 --> 00:49:57.887
I would request you very-very earnestly and
with a great concern that you have to look

00:49:57.887 --> 00:50:01.517
after your Self-Realization and your growth.

00:50:01.517 --> 00:50:10.377
As we do not take any money from anyone, we
don’t have very elaborate places or elaborate

00:50:10.377 --> 00:50:15.277
centers, so whatever is available is there
for you.

00:50:15.277 --> 00:50:22.277
But that is God’s place and you have to
come there to get all the information, the

00:50:22.277 --> 00:50:26.857
knowledge about the Self.

00:50:26.857 --> 00:50:39.707
I hope you will not treat it with just a side
issue, but the main object of your human

00:50:39.707 --> 00:50:41.469
ascent.

00:50:42.668 --> 00:50:47.907
You don’t have to pay for it; you don’t
have to do anything else.

00:50:47.907 --> 00:50:58.027
Moreover, we are all the time trying to save
time and that is why the time has to be spent

00:50:58.027 --> 00:51:03.297
is been collective and enjoying the joy.

00:51:03.297 --> 00:51:08.647
May God bless you all.

00:51:09.519 --> 00:51:12.949
So both hands have to be like this, to begin
with.

00:51:14.117 --> 00:51:21.843
This is because as I told you these are all
sympathetic centers which are to be enlightened

00:51:21.843 --> 00:51:25.934
first of all, so the information goes to the
Kundalini that the Kundalini is to be awakened.

00:51:25.950 --> 00:51:28.251
This is first thing we have to do.

00:51:28.276 --> 00:51:37.370
Now, secondly, we have to facilitate the movement
of the Kundalini even if she’s awakened.

00:51:37.370 --> 00:51:45.830
And for that I will tell you how to put your
hand into various centers to the various centers

00:51:45.830 --> 00:51:49.352
so that you can yourself facilitate.

00:51:49.377 --> 00:51:53.620
I would like one of you to get up and show
this better.

00:51:53.620 --> 00:51:55.320
Yeah.

00:51:55.320 --> 00:52:02.340
Now Dr. Spiro will show you also and I will
also that first you have to put your hand

00:52:02.340 --> 00:52:04.100
to your heart where resides.

00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.430
Now left hand towards Me and right hand on
the heart.

00:52:08.430 --> 00:52:11.540
Left hand towards Me.

00:52:11.540 --> 00:52:16.910
Now to your heart and here resides the Spirit.

00:52:16.910 --> 00:52:23.380
We work only on the left hand side, because
that is the side of our desire and put the

00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:30.880
left hand like this symbolically meaning that
this is the power of desire and we want to

00:52:30.880 --> 00:52:34.970
have our Self-Realization, expression of that.

00:52:34.970 --> 00:52:44.600
Now the second chakra is on the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side.

00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:56.570
This is the center of your mastery by which
the mastery over this power of love or Divine

00:52:56.570 --> 00:53:00.650
vibrations you achieve and manifest through
your being.

00:53:00.650 --> 00:53:04.840
Is just starts working like through our eyes
we can see the light.

00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:13.340
In the same way, once you become the master,
you can feel, you can know everything about

00:53:13.340 --> 00:53:16.570
yourself and about others.

00:53:16.570 --> 00:53:26.640
Then you have to take down your right hand
to the lower part of your abdomen.

00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:36.790
This is the one, which is working out our
pure knowledge, knowledge, which is absolute

00:53:36.790 --> 00:53:38.060
and pure.

00:53:38.060 --> 00:53:44.810
This center is very important and by some
unauthorized people if some people have tamper

00:53:44.810 --> 00:53:51.130
it we have to nourish it by putting our right
hand towards it.

00:53:51.130 --> 00:53:58.860
Then again we go back into the upper part
of the abdomen.

00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:01.380
Then we go back to our heart.

00:54:01.380 --> 00:54:12.130
Now here we go back to the left hand side
of our neck, here, like this from front.

00:54:12.130 --> 00:54:14.570
Many people tried this side (Shri Mataji pointed
to the back side of Her neck).

00:54:14.570 --> 00:54:15.570
No.

00:54:15.570 --> 00:54:21.040
You have to try from front and then turn your
head to your right, like this.

00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:30.489
Now this center catches when we feel guilty
and now I find quite a lot catching in this

00:54:30.489 --> 00:54:31.489
audience.

00:54:31.489 --> 00:54:39.210
So please for the sake of your Self-Realization
forgive yourself, forgive yourself, forgive

00:54:39.210 --> 00:54:40.210
yourself.

00:54:40.210 --> 00:54:48.310
Now, please now stretch your hand like this
and put it on top of your forehead.

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:53.140
This is the center of forgiveness, – here.

00:54:53.140 --> 00:54:55.700
And press it on both the sides, like this.

00:54:55.700 --> 00:55:04.322
Now you have to take this hand on the back,
rest your head on that, put the head up.

00:55:04.322 --> 00:55:16.030
And then you have to take out your hand again
and stretch it like this.

00:55:16.030 --> 00:55:17.080
Fully stretched.

00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:22.790
The center of your palm is to be placed on
top of the fontanel bone area.

00:55:22.790 --> 00:55:25.240
You might bend your head a little, would be
better.

00:55:25.240 --> 00:55:34.560
Just there, which was a soft bone in your
childhood, and you have to press your scalp

00:55:34.560 --> 00:55:41.340
and move it about seven times slowly in a
clockwise manner.

00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:52.940
That’s all we have to do.

00:55:52.940 --> 00:55:58.530
But we must press it hard and the fingers
must be pushed back nicely so that we can

00:55:58.530 --> 00:56:01.020
press our palm nicely.

00:56:01.020 --> 00:56:02.270
All right.

00:56:02.270 --> 00:56:06.530
That’s all is to be done.

00:56:06.530 --> 00:56:10.090
[INAUDIBLE WORD – Principally ?]

00:56:10.090 --> 00:56:12.239
Now we have to close our eyes.

00:56:12.239 --> 00:56:15.870
Please don’t open your eyes till I’ll
tell you.

00:56:15.870 --> 00:56:24.200
Because the attention will be attracted inside
and please you can take out your glasses.

00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.790
The other day one lady who was quite blind
I think and she started seeing this, I mean,

00:56:28.790 --> 00:56:33.239
you know, things happen like that.

00:56:33.239 --> 00:56:35.960
I would request you to take out your glasses.

00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:36.980
It helps you.

00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:42.780
And you keep your eyes shut till I’ll tell
you, please don’t open your eyes.

00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:51.510
It is how you are going to help yourself and
also you will know how to all the time raise

00:56:51.510 --> 00:56:53.320
your Kundalini.

00:56:53.320 --> 00:57:00.560
It’s very simple method, which I’m telling
you.

00:57:00.560 --> 00:57:07.430
Now, please put your left hand towards Me
like this and right hand on your heart.

00:57:07.430 --> 00:57:13.979
Left hand towards Me and right hand on your
heart.

00:57:13.979 --> 00:57:17.260
Here, now close your eyes.

00:57:17.260 --> 00:57:20.070
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:57:20.070 --> 00:57:25.530
So please ask Me question within yourself,
a very fundamental question, you can call

00:57:25.530 --> 00:57:32.640
Me Shri Mataji or Mother, whatever you like,
“Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:37.469
Ask this question, “Mother, am I the Spirit?”

00:57:37.469 --> 00:57:44.715
Is a very fundamental question here to ask.

00:57:44.779 --> 00:57:50.249
Ask this question three times.

00:57:50.249 --> 00:57:58.229
Now, if you are the Spirit, you are also your
guide and master.

00:57:58.229 --> 00:58:04.890
Please put your right hand in the upper part
of your abdomen on the left hand side, on

00:58:04.890 --> 00:58:15.650
your stomach on the left hand side and press
it hard and ask a question here three times

00:58:15.650 --> 00:58:20.020
again, “Mother, am I my own master?

00:58:20.020 --> 00:58:23.700
Mother, am I my own master?

00:58:23.700 --> 00:58:27.630
Mother, am I my own master?”

00:58:27.630 --> 00:58:33.960
Ask this question in your heart.

00:58:33.960 --> 00:58:50.270
Now, we move our right hand, move it down
into the lower part of your abdomen on the

00:58:50.270 --> 00:58:51.450
left hand side.

00:58:51.450 --> 00:58:58.860
Now here, please keep your eyes shut, please
keep your eyes shut and don’t move too much.

00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:10.360
Here you have to know that I respect your
freedom and I can not force you to have the

00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:11.450
pure knowledge.

00:59:11.450 --> 00:59:15.270
You have to say that you want it.

00:59:15.270 --> 00:59:26.636
So here you please say, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge” six times, because

00:59:26.661 --> 00:59:29.336
this center has got six petals.

00:59:29.361 --> 00:59:39.261
So please say six times, “Mother, please
give me pure knowledge”.

00:59:44.530 --> 00:59:53.856
With this asking the Kundalini starts rising,
because she knows you want it.

00:59:54.142 --> 01:00:03.860
Now to facilitate her movement we go back
to the higher chakra and take our hand to

01:00:03.860 --> 01:00:09.633
the upper part of the abdomen on the left
hand side and press it hard.

01:00:09.658 --> 01:00:21.001
Now, with full confidence we have to say ten
times, “Mother, I am my own master”.

01:00:21.026 --> 01:00:28.197
Say it with full confidence so the Kundalini
will rise, “Mother, I am my own master”.

01:00:28.284 --> 01:00:32.580
Please say it ten times.

01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:45.407
This will correct your spiritual domination
if somebody has dominated you spiritually

01:00:45.432 --> 01:00:50.312
in the sense that they have misguided you
spiritually.

01:00:50.312 --> 01:00:55.142
“I am my own master”.

01:00:55.142 --> 01:01:11.582
Now, raise your right hand to the heart.

01:01:11.607 --> 01:01:15.887
Here resides the Spirit.

01:01:18.412 --> 01:01:34.002
So with full confidence say twelve times,
“Mother, I am the Spirit”.

01:01:34.002 --> 01:01:35.538
Have confidence in yourself.

01:01:35.563 --> 01:01:44.460
We have to know, that the Divine is the ocean
of love and compassion.

01:01:44.485 --> 01:01:54.032
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness
and we can not commit any mistakes, which

01:01:54.032 --> 01:01:59.082
the Divine can not forgive.

01:01:59.082 --> 01:02:10.917
So please forgive yourself, forgive yourself
fully, and raise your right hand in the corner

01:02:10.942 --> 01:02:17.211
of your neck and your shoulder, and turn your
head to the right.

01:02:17.236 --> 01:02:29.222
And here with full confidence you say sixteen
times, “Mother, I am not guilty at all”.

01:02:29.222 --> 01:02:35.182
Please say it, very important and as I said,
if you still feel guilty, you can punish yourself

01:02:35.182 --> 01:02:38.322
by saying it hundred and eight times.

01:02:38.347 --> 01:02:45.028
You have to be pleasantly placed towards yourself
because you are going to enter into the Kingdom

01:02:45.053 --> 01:02:47.290
of God.

01:02:50.678 --> 01:02:55.953
You have to love yourself and respect yourself.

01:02:56.247 --> 01:03:17.877
Sixteen times please say it.

01:03:22.751 --> 01:03:31.461
Now raise your hand and put it on your forehead
across.

01:03:31.461 --> 01:03:36.461
Put it on your forehead across.

01:03:36.461 --> 01:03:40.661
This is the center of forgiveness.

01:03:40.661 --> 01:03:52.345
So please here
you have to say, “Mother, I forgive everyone”,

01:03:52.370 --> 01:03:54.140
from your heart.

01:03:55.411 --> 01:03:59.791
You might say it is difficult, but it is a
myth.

01:03:59.791 --> 01:04:04.280
Whether you forgive or you do not forgive
you do not do anything.

01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:08.010
But if you do not forgive then you play into
wrong hands.

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:15.250
So to get over all the loads you just say
from your heart, “Mother, I forgive everyone”.

01:04:15.250 --> 01:04:20.280
It’s not important how many times.

01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:25.851
Press it on both the sides please.

01:04:25.851 --> 01:04:43.116
Now take back your hand, and put your hand
on the back of your head, and raise your head

01:04:43.155 --> 01:04:44.187
on that.

01:04:44.417 --> 01:04:47.111
Move your head upward.

01:04:47.111 --> 01:04:56.051
Now here for your own satisfaction only, without
counting any mistakes or guilt you can say,

01:04:56.051 --> 01:05:03.681
“Oh, Divine, if I have made any mistakes,
please forgive me”.

01:05:03.681 --> 01:05:08.050
For your own satisfaction, don’t feel guilty
about it.

01:05:08.075 --> 01:05:11.764
In a very pleasant manner.

01:05:17.571 --> 01:05:32.530
Now stretch your hand fully, push back your
fingers, and put the center of your palm on

01:05:32.530 --> 01:05:42.851
top of the fontanel bone area, and now start
moving it very slowly, very slowly clockwise

01:05:42.851 --> 01:05:43.931
the scalp.

01:05:43.931 --> 01:05:46.541
Press it hard, push back your fingers.

01:05:46.541 --> 01:05:47.541
Seven times.

01:05:47.541 --> 01:05:54.581
At this point I must say that I can not force
again the Self-Realization upon you.

01:05:54.581 --> 01:05:56.861
I respect your freedom.

01:05:56.861 --> 01:05:58.551
You have to ask for it.

01:05:58.551 --> 01:06:08.190
So please say seven times, “Mother, please
give me my Realization, give me my Self-Realization”.

01:06:08.215 --> 01:06:11.339
Or, “May I have my Self-Realization”.

01:06:12.712 --> 01:07:14.291
(Shri Mataji is blowing in the microphone
7 times.)

01:07:14.291 --> 01:07:20.780
Now please take down your hands.

01:07:20.780 --> 01:07:28.270
Please open your eyes very slowly.

01:07:28.270 --> 01:07:30.701
Now watch Me without thinking.

01:07:30.701 --> 01:07:33.181
Let’s see if you can do it.

01:07:33.181 --> 01:07:34.471
Without thinking.

01:07:34.471 --> 01:07:39.750
Just watch Me without thinking.

01:07:39.750 --> 01:07:47.061
Please put your right hand towards Me, right
hand towards Me like this.

01:07:47.061 --> 01:07:55.321
And the left hand above your head and bend
your head and try to see if you are feeling

01:07:55.321 --> 01:07:57.341
any cool breeze from here.

01:07:57.341 --> 01:07:59.871
Bend your head, bend, bend it.

01:08:12.065 --> 01:08:13.169
Little higher.

01:08:13.201 --> 01:08:15.944
Some people get it very high, very high they
get it, some of them.

01:08:15.969 --> 01:08:18.079
Move it.

01:08:19.326 --> 01:08:25.926
And now put the left hand towards Me like
this, again bend your head and see if you

01:08:25.926 --> 01:08:39.285
are getting a cool breeze in your head.

01:08:39.285 --> 01:08:46.108
Now put your right hand towards Me again,
bend your head and see for yourself again

01:08:46.133 --> 01:08:50.403
if there’s a cool breeze.

01:08:59.954 --> 01:09:10.656
Now raise both your hands towards the sky
and push back your head and ask a question

01:09:10.656 --> 01:09:16.546
three times, “Mother, is this the cool breeze
of the Holy Ghost?

01:09:16.546 --> 01:09:18.666
Mother, is this the Brahma Shakti?

01:09:18.666 --> 01:09:22.504
Mother, is this the All Pervading Power of
God’s Love?”

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:27.004
Just ask the question.

01:09:30.626 --> 01:09:33.348
Now put down your hands.

01:09:33.373 --> 01:09:36.023
Now please put your hands like this.

01:09:43.356 --> 01:09:48.916
You’ll feel very relaxed and peaceful.

01:09:48.916 --> 01:09:52.876
In the hands also you’ll feel little cool
breeze coming.

01:09:52.876 --> 01:09:58.775
Some people might feel in one hand, might
feel in another hand.

01:09:58.775 --> 01:10:02.805
Some of them do feel that way.

01:10:02.805 --> 01:10:19.865
All those who are feeling the cool breeze
on top of their heads or on their fingertips,

01:10:19.865 --> 01:10:23.813
please raise both your hands.

01:10:24.043 --> 01:10:32.285
Both hands to be raised those who are feeling
it.

01:10:32.285 --> 01:10:37.745
Just imagine!

01:10:37.745 --> 01:10:40.826
Most of them have felt it.

01:10:40.826 --> 01:10:42.045
Imagine.

01:10:42.045 --> 01:10:44.496
Hardly very few haven’t felt.

01:10:44.496 --> 01:10:53.015
It’s very easy for them also to feel it
and if they want they can come up to the stage

01:10:53.015 --> 01:10:54.955
and people can look after them.

01:10:54.955 --> 01:11:02.095
They can feel it today, they should and they
will work out their Kundalini.

01:11:02.095 --> 01:11:10.342
Maybe little help is needed and it’s very
kind of you, all of you to have received your

01:11:10.367 --> 01:11:11.842
Realization.

01:11:11.867 --> 01:11:14.382
I bow to all of you.

01:11:14.572 --> 01:11:21.665
I bow to all of you and I beg of you as a
Mother that please look after your Self-Realization,

01:11:21.665 --> 01:11:24.115
do not waste it.

01:11:24.115 --> 01:11:30.375
Those who haven’t got it should not feel
in any way disturbed or upset, it’s very

01:11:30.375 --> 01:11:31.526
simple.

01:11:31.526 --> 01:11:37.026
Maybe the little time was needed more or whatever
it is.

01:11:37.026 --> 01:11:41.615
I would request them to come on the stage
for five minutes or ten minutes and they might

01:11:41.615 --> 01:11:44.446
get their Realization very well.

01:11:44.446 --> 01:11:46.716
May God bless you.

01:11:46.716 --> 01:11:55.574
Also if you want to come and meet Me you can
come on the stage, I would like to talk to

01:11:55.599 --> 01:11:56.599
you.

01:12:02.319 --> 01:12:03.319
So many!

01:12:03.344 --> 01:12:05.413
Now what do you want?

01:12:05.595 --> 01:12:09.645
The England, the whole England!

01:12:09.645 --> 01:12:15.416
Those who want to be should come, one by one,
please.
