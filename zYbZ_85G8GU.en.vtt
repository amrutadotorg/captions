00:00:03.068 --> 00:00:09.922
For the last so many lectures, we have been saying

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.136
that you cannot pay for God’s love.

00:00:14.136 --> 00:00:18.892
It makes me laugh sometimes.

00:00:19.868 --> 00:00:24.868
Human beings can never understand his love,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.720
because they live in a very limited sphere.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.651
His love is unlimited. His forgiveness is unlimited.

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:40.413
Even this word “unlimited” and “infinite”, we do not understand

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:44.308
because we have not known anything like that.

00:00:44.308 --> 00:00:46.428
And to say that something is genuine

00:00:46.948 --> 00:00:49.468
is also like certifying something that is genuine.

00:00:49.948 --> 00:00:51.800
You don’t need a certificate.

00:00:51.868 --> 00:00:55.043
Even that human beings don't understand.

00:00:56.388 --> 00:01:01.368
We live with artificiality,

00:01:01.988 --> 00:01:05.228
we try to find the truth,

00:01:05.228 --> 00:01:08.268
again we accept artificiality as truth.

00:01:08.828 --> 00:01:10.760
Again we go on fighting.

00:01:10.868 --> 00:01:13.348
Then we think this is the truth.

00:01:14.108 --> 00:01:16.774
Again that turns out to be something, artificial thing

00:01:16.774 --> 00:01:20.018
or some sort of a mental projection.

00:01:20.308 --> 00:01:27.611
All these limited endeavours of human beings

00:01:27.611 --> 00:01:31.200
and the experiences they have,

00:01:31.308 --> 00:01:35.948
made him so conditioned,

00:01:35.948 --> 00:01:41.747
that it is not easy to understand God.

00:01:42.188 --> 00:01:47.844
He made all this universe in his compassion and love.

00:01:47.844 --> 00:01:51.732
He created you as human beings, also in his compassion and love.

00:01:51.732 --> 00:01:53.492
He doesn’t need anything.

00:01:54.068 --> 00:01:56.108
But he loves.

00:01:57.028 --> 00:02:03.858
And you can’t understand a person who loves beyond any reason,

00:02:04.148 --> 00:02:11.139
without any reward, just love because for love’s sake.

00:02:11.388 --> 00:02:18.988
We can’t think of one human being like that, who can love only for love’s sake.

00:02:18.988 --> 00:02:24.157
Only after Realization, as you grow more and more,

00:02:24.157 --> 00:02:30.377
you realise that loving is the greatest joy.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.868
And then, you cannot think of money in relation to him.

00:02:35.068 --> 00:02:39.348
It's something, you'll say but, I think,

00:02:39.948 --> 00:02:44.240
even to say this, "We don't need money or we don't take money"

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.842
itself is so low level.

00:02:49.268 --> 00:02:53.800
It's so, so much gross.

00:02:54.948 --> 00:03:01.466
Because money and all these concepts are your own.

00:03:02.268 --> 00:03:06.874
He didn't make this world to get any fruits out of it.

00:03:07.188 --> 00:03:08.828
Nothing.

00:03:09.228 --> 00:03:11.348
He just made it because he loved.

00:03:11.828 --> 00:03:13.028
He wanted to express His Love.

00:03:13.228 --> 00:03:16.679
Just to manifest that Love, he made this world.

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:18.868
There’s nothing else expected

00:03:19.068 --> 00:03:24.148
and to put the human mind at that level is an impossibility, I find, in the beginning.

00:03:24.148 --> 00:03:28.908
But gradually they start understanding how forgiving he is,

00:03:28.908 --> 00:03:32.268
how kind he is, how nice he is.

00:03:32.268 --> 00:03:35.948
So the first problem I have to face in the West always

00:03:35.948 --> 00:03:40.068
even in Paris this was the problem that I faced

00:03:40.068 --> 00:03:45.305
was that human beings feel guilty.

00:03:45.868 --> 00:03:48.948
And this guilt is such a big problem in the West,

00:03:49.148 --> 00:03:50.948
I just don't understand.

00:03:51.188 --> 00:03:52.948
You see, why do you feel guilty so much,

00:03:53.148 --> 00:03:56.068
as that is one of the hurdles of Sahaja Yoga, I've seen,

00:03:56.268 --> 00:03:58.148
that people start feeling guilty.

00:03:58.348 --> 00:03:59.908
To such an extent,

00:04:00.108 --> 00:04:03.188
that they don't believe that they can get Realization.

00:04:03.868 --> 00:04:06.948
They think they are sinners born outright,

00:04:07.188 --> 00:04:10.348
permanently, branded as 'sinners',

00:04:11.148 --> 00:04:13.828
and they can never take their Realization.

00:04:14.028 --> 00:04:15.988
I mean, just they brand themselves.

00:04:16.268 --> 00:04:17.908
It's beyond self pity also,

00:04:18.108 --> 00:04:22.268
I would say it's even self-destructive.

00:04:22.268 --> 00:04:25.868
Today, I've taken up this subject of Left Vishuddhi,

00:04:26.068 --> 00:04:30.108
because I felt that I must one day speak on this subject,

00:04:30.308 --> 00:04:33.028
that this is absolutely,

00:04:34.348 --> 00:04:41.116
not inteligible to God that you are guilty. For what?

00:04:42.348 --> 00:04:45.148
Guilty for what are you?

00:04:45.348 --> 00:04:48.148
If you ask yourself, you'll say, "Oh, we are guilty,

00:04:48.348 --> 00:04:50.948
because we've crucified Christ" at the most.

00:04:51.148 --> 00:04:54.868
That is the maximum guilt a human being, let's say, on his head.

00:04:55.068 --> 00:05:02.728
"We crucified Christ, we tortured all the saints". All right.

00:05:03.388 --> 00:05:07.348
But by being guilty what do you get?

00:05:07.348 --> 00:05:11.148
Do you get Him back, can you go back and correct that situation?

00:05:11.348 --> 00:05:13.948
You cannot.

00:05:13.948 --> 00:05:18.148
But harping upon that, you do get into your subconscious mind.

00:05:18.148 --> 00:05:25.792
You get into a position where you are no more normal to receive the Love of God.

00:05:26.068 --> 00:05:29.028
You recede into a corner of your mind,

00:05:29.228 --> 00:05:30.948
which is darkness,

00:05:31.148 --> 00:05:33.348
which is ignorant, which is blindness,

00:05:34.188 --> 00:05:37.348
where you cannot receive that beautiful reign,

00:05:38.268 --> 00:05:44.747
that eternal flow that's coming in.

00:05:45.188 --> 00:05:47.828
You hide yourself, at the back,

00:05:48.028 --> 00:05:49.788
and then you say,

00:05:49.988 --> 00:05:51.348
"What about the sun?

00:05:51.988 --> 00:05:57.409
I cannot receive it because I don't deserve it."

00:05:58.948 --> 00:06:02.195
Behind all this ego orientation in the West -

00:06:02.195 --> 00:06:07.268
Oh, I think, I wish they were purely egoistical. They are not.

00:06:07.268 --> 00:06:14.104
All this ego recedes bac ,into that little pouch, what we call the 'guilt'.

00:06:15.148 --> 00:06:17.988
You say something to someone.

00:06:17.988 --> 00:06:20.388
It's saying that point, that stage,

00:06:20.868 --> 00:06:24.650
that, "I've said it. All right, I've said it. I can take the responsability, i's good."

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.028
Not that.

00:06:26.028 --> 00:06:31.108
But you come back home, "Oh, I should not have said that".

00:06:31.108 --> 00:06:36.597
So you wobble between one kind of action into another kind,

00:06:36.868 --> 00:06:39.468
from say, into an aggressive

00:06:39.948 --> 00:06:43.228
to another one of a receding type

00:06:43.228 --> 00:06:45.348
And this wobbling really,

00:06:46.028 --> 00:06:48.108
is very, very troublesome.

00:06:48.308 --> 00:06:50.188
It can go on too much.

00:06:50.388 --> 00:06:52.868
The oscilation could be so much.

00:06:53.108 --> 00:06:56.068
that it can make you absolutely frantic,

00:06:56.268 --> 00:07:02.406
diffident, and sometimes, useless.

00:07:04.948 --> 00:07:06.868
On the contrary,

00:07:07.268 --> 00:07:09.268
God wants to find human beings,

00:07:09.828 --> 00:07:11.108
who are cheerful people,

00:07:11.308 --> 00:07:13.068
who are happy people,

00:07:13.268 --> 00:07:15.868
who are thankful to Him for His blessings.

00:07:18.268 --> 00:07:21.428
The most unhappy animal in this world,

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.774
is the human being, can you believe that?

00:07:25.348 --> 00:07:29.188
Animals, don't know happiness and unhappiness, also a good point is.

00:07:31.308 --> 00:07:33.268
But the most unhappy human being,

00:07:33.468 --> 00:07:36.068
and the most complicated human being,

00:07:36.948 --> 00:07:40.028
has become so over you see, self-destructive,

00:07:40.028 --> 00:07:43.124
that a destruction force is built within himself.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:50.433
Now think of that force that has built you up into a human

00:07:50.948 --> 00:07:53.068
how with care and love,

00:07:53.268 --> 00:07:56.068
without your knowledge, without troubling you.

00:07:56.268 --> 00:07:59.108
Even when you were born you never knew what was the pain,

00:07:59.308 --> 00:08:02.268
of the birth. Your mother took over it.

00:08:02.268 --> 00:08:04.988
He's made you a human being

00:08:04.988 --> 00:08:10.185
so carefully, delicately he's built you up.

00:08:11.028 --> 00:08:12.348
For what?

00:08:12.988 --> 00:08:17.326
What is the fruit of this beautiful flower?

00:08:18.348 --> 00:08:20.148
Why the flower starts hitting itself?

00:08:20.348 --> 00:08:23.478
Have you ever heard of anyone like that?

00:08:25.268 --> 00:08:27.828
This is the worst disease, which

00:08:28.348 --> 00:08:31.428
we in the West suffer.

00:08:33.108 --> 00:08:35.068
French yes,

00:08:35.348 --> 00:08:37.228
we had at least double the number of people

00:08:37.428 --> 00:08:39.268
that we have here today, surprisingly.

00:08:39.468 --> 00:08:41.988
But, also they have the same problem.

00:08:42.188 --> 00:08:45.308
And I think all their psychologists,

00:08:46.508 --> 00:08:48.508
psychoanalists,

00:08:49.268 --> 00:08:52.428
or we can say the, all the books,

00:08:52.868 --> 00:08:55.028
all the writers, the philosophers,

00:08:55.228 --> 00:08:59.216
everyone has done to them.

00:08:59.988 --> 00:09:02.348
They have given these ideas,

00:09:02.988 --> 00:09:05.148
and everybody accepts them.

00:09:05.908 --> 00:09:09.108
And they curse themselves morning till evening,

00:09:09.988 --> 00:09:12.868
walking with so many wrinkles on the forehead.

00:09:13.468 --> 00:09:15.148
When you ask them, they will say,

00:09:15.348 --> 00:09:17.908
"Mother we are very unhappy people".

00:09:18.268 --> 00:09:25.291
It's like asking unhappiness to come and decorate you.

00:09:26.348 --> 00:09:34.479
But it has a subtler meaning of which people are not aware.

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.348
These are the times,

00:09:38.348 --> 00:09:41.108
when you have to get your Realization.

00:09:41.348 --> 00:09:43.828
This mass Realization has to work out.

00:09:44.028 --> 00:09:45.868
It's all prophesized,

00:09:46.148 --> 00:09:48.954
and very important times are these.

00:09:49.428 --> 00:09:52.188
All the stars are acting to help us.

00:09:53.028 --> 00:09:55.188
The whole universe is helping us.

00:09:56.348 --> 00:09:58.468
All the elements are helping us.

00:09:58.988 --> 00:10:02.077
We are on the stage.

00:10:03.268 --> 00:10:05.868
But when the actors arrive on the stage,

00:10:05.868 --> 00:10:07.948
they are finished, they can't act.

00:10:08.188 --> 00:10:10.948
They can't do anything, they can't play their game.

00:10:11.268 --> 00:10:14.988
They are so involved with their different roles.

00:10:18.228 --> 00:10:21.268
And that is why one has to understand the subtler effect of it,

00:10:21.468 --> 00:10:23.828
then only you will get rid of this guilt.

00:10:24.028 --> 00:10:28.317
You are playing into the hands of negative forces.

00:10:29.068 --> 00:10:35.068
They are not less than any atomic bombs,

00:10:35.068 --> 00:10:36.908
built within yourselves.

00:10:37.948 --> 00:10:39.468
Now what is the way it works out,

00:10:39.908 --> 00:10:41.788
I think people do not realize it.

00:10:41.988 --> 00:10:44.108
It's a very subtle method.

00:10:44.348 --> 00:10:45.948
Let's see the atomic bomb,

00:10:46.148 --> 00:10:50.196
hidrogen bomb, what will you do there?

00:10:51.348 --> 00:10:54.348
They will separate something which should not be separated.

00:10:57.148 --> 00:11:02.188
We break atom, which is not divisible,

00:11:02.188 --> 00:11:04.633
into its divisible parts.

00:11:05.228 --> 00:11:11.468
So we put a pressure to break them.

00:11:11.468 --> 00:11:13.948
And when that breaking force,

00:11:14.148 --> 00:11:15.988
that aggression I would say,

00:11:16.188 --> 00:11:18.188
is worked out,

00:11:19.508 --> 00:11:23.108
that becomes another destructive force.

00:11:24.988 --> 00:11:28.028
So whatever effort we have put into that,

00:11:28.268 --> 00:11:31.468
multiplies, it's not the same force.

00:11:33.348 --> 00:11:37.134
And that we use for our destruction.

00:11:37.134 --> 00:11:42.162
I mean, this only human being can do,
to create things to destroy himself.

00:11:42.868 --> 00:11:46.148
But this force, which works within our minds,

00:11:46.348 --> 00:11:48.228
within ourselves, within our being,

00:11:48.428 --> 00:11:52.188
where we actually really hate ourselves sometimes I feel,

00:11:52.388 --> 00:11:54.868
the way we are destroying ourselves,

00:11:56.068 --> 00:11:57.468
this force

00:11:58.068 --> 00:12:00.428
we build within ourselves thanks to  many

00:12:00.828 --> 00:12:03.108
nonsensical writers and conditioners

00:12:03.308 --> 00:12:07.675
and people who talk of conditioning really condition you much worse!

00:12:08.068 --> 00:12:10.428
You should be singing and chanting like a bird.

00:12:11.428 --> 00:12:14.228
You should be laughing and enjoying like a flower.

00:12:15.108 --> 00:12:17.108
But I find human beings faces,

00:12:17.308 --> 00:12:20.228
all, looking so very unhappy.

00:12:21.348 --> 00:12:23.228
What's the reason?

00:12:23.868 --> 00:12:29.582
The reason is you are separated from your own being,

00:12:30.268 --> 00:12:35.148
the being that integrates you. You are completely disintegrated.

00:12:35.148 --> 00:12:42.148
When you disintegrate the hidrogen atom

00:12:42.148 --> 00:12:45.108
you form a very big force built into it.

00:12:45.428 --> 00:12:51.388
In the same way, you are the disintegrating your being:

00:12:51.388 --> 00:12:55.148
your physical being on one side, your mental being on another side,

00:12:55.348 --> 00:13:00.622
your spiritual being on another side, there's no integrating point.

00:13:01.228 --> 00:13:05.610
And when you cannot feel that integration,

00:13:05.868 --> 00:13:07.188
you feel guilty,

00:13:07.388 --> 00:13:10.068
but that guilt is just a symptom of

00:13:10.268 --> 00:13:15.000
a very big destructive force built in you.

00:13:16.348 --> 00:13:22.640
This is the way we are going to destroy ourselves.

00:13:23.268 --> 00:13:24.948
No other way.

00:13:25.148 --> 00:13:27.828
Our destruction is not going to come to us from outside.

00:13:28.028 --> 00:13:29.908
That can be controlled.

00:13:30.868 --> 00:13:36.277
It's going to come from within, within ourselves.

00:13:37.108 --> 00:13:40.348
Everything we do now, after disintegration,

00:13:41.108 --> 00:13:49.789
is further disintegration
or further building up that negative force within us.

00:13:51.508 --> 00:13:55.739
But to integrate it,

00:13:56.308 --> 00:14:00.348
to make you feel complete integration with all your being,

00:14:01.908 --> 00:14:04.068
it's only possible

00:14:04.828 --> 00:14:06.508
if you can somehow or other

00:14:06.948 --> 00:14:08.868
get to that integrating force

00:14:09.068 --> 00:14:15.000
which is still there and is quite deep.

00:14:18.348 --> 00:14:22.228
That's the last chance, I would say now, that has to work.

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:25.428
The way the negative forces have set in motion

00:14:26.068 --> 00:14:29.148
of which you may not be aware at all, you may not be aware,

00:14:29.348 --> 00:14:33.348
you don't know what darkness is there.

00:14:35.028 --> 00:14:39.908
And to fight it, what one has to do

00:14:40.068 --> 00:14:45.808
is to bring that light of the Spirit,
which integrates.

00:14:46.388 --> 00:14:48.348
Darkness always disintegrates you.

00:14:48.908 --> 00:14:51.228
For example, there's complete darkness, all right,

00:14:51.428 --> 00:14:54.428
I can't feel you, I don't know who you are, where you are sitting.

00:14:54.988 --> 00:14:56.268
We are all separate.

00:14:56.468 --> 00:14:59.888
I can't see you, I don't know who you people are there.

00:15:00.028 --> 00:15:02.868
I wouldn't know where is the window, where is the door.

00:15:03.428 --> 00:15:06.068
I'll hold this and say, "This is the truth".

00:15:07.308 --> 00:15:11.248
All disintegrated personalities,
and disintegrated people,

00:15:11.908 --> 00:15:14.268
always see aberrations. They see different things,

00:15:14.468 --> 00:15:16.348
different auras, different things.

00:15:19.468 --> 00:15:23.468
Now, it's a very vicious circle.
You just think of it.

00:15:24.148 --> 00:15:28.848
It's a very great vicious circle we have.

00:15:29.348 --> 00:15:38.388
The vicious circle is that we try to think about it,

00:15:38.388 --> 00:15:40.148
which is limited.

00:15:40.348 --> 00:15:43.388
Supposing I have a limited vision, there's darkness

00:15:44.028 --> 00:15:46.759
what will I feel?

00:15:47.908 --> 00:15:52.388
You start thinking about it and thinking about it,
pondering over it.

00:15:52.468 --> 00:15:58.255
The more you think about it, the worse it becomes.

00:16:01.108 --> 00:16:04.868
Another way could be people may try to solve this problem,

00:16:05.268 --> 00:16:07.888
to think that we are disintegrated,

00:16:08.068 --> 00:16:12.388
is to talk of big things, "We are all brothers and sisters,

00:16:12.428 --> 00:16:14.948
let's form U.N. counseling,

00:16:15.428 --> 00:16:19.108
let's do world organization".

00:16:19.348 --> 00:16:22.788
All blind people doing world organization will end up

00:16:22.988 --> 00:16:30.523
at the most, as a labour, what you call, labour department.

00:16:30.523 --> 00:16:32.868
That's all.

00:16:33.388 --> 00:16:40.428
With all these institutions
working in the big name,

00:16:41.428 --> 00:16:43.068
where are we?

00:16:43.508 --> 00:16:50.508
Actually, when we become aware, we don't need them.

00:16:50.508 --> 00:16:53.779
We don't need at all.

00:16:54.988 --> 00:16:57.908
So, this awareness is nothing but

00:16:58.108 --> 00:17:02.380
the light of the Spirit within you which is missing.

00:17:02.908 --> 00:17:05.068
The Spirit is watching you, all right.

00:17:05.268 --> 00:17:06.908
It goes up to a point

00:17:07.108 --> 00:17:11.868
to see your stupidity and your limitedness.

00:17:13.188 --> 00:17:18.908
And it goes up to a very great extent, I should say,
where it's finished.

00:17:19.028 --> 00:17:22.148
It disappears and a person dies,

00:17:22.428 --> 00:17:25.188
or he gets into trouble, he becomes creazy, mad,

00:17:25.388 --> 00:17:26.828
whatever you may call him.

00:17:27.028 --> 00:17:32.888
He develops other diseases like cancer,

00:17:33.028 --> 00:17:38.908
which are caused by another problem here,
as you know, Ekadesha.

00:17:39.508 --> 00:17:47.895
So, these forces are built within us, of negativity,

00:17:53.388 --> 00:17:55.508
So, in the Kundalini shastra,

00:17:55.988 --> 00:18:01.833
we can say that the left and right side
when used too much,

00:18:02.948 --> 00:18:09.268
you build up these forces in the head of eleven Rudras,
the eleven distructive forces.

00:18:09.268 --> 00:18:12.068
A cancer patient develops it.

00:18:12.268 --> 00:18:16.148
But even before developing cancer,
people can develop it.

00:18:16.428 --> 00:18:22.988
And there are so many things,
that can create this,

00:18:23.348 --> 00:18:27.028
that sometimes one would feel,
in this vicious circle

00:18:27.228 --> 00:18:31.477
that, "How are you going to patch up the whole society?"

00:18:31.868 --> 00:18:40.188
And there's only one thing,
that will save the situation, it's Self-realization.

00:18:42.228 --> 00:18:51.348
All other things are destroying, are absolutely confusing.

00:18:51.868 --> 00:18:55.437
But there's only one thing if you can do,

00:18:55.437 --> 00:19:00.527
it saves the whole thing, like putting on the light, finished!

00:19:01.868 --> 00:19:07.228
But people don't understand the importance of Self-realization,

00:19:07.228 --> 00:19:12.060
because some people ask me, "What's the use of getting the cool breeze in the hand?"

00:19:12.428 --> 00:19:15.988
Now, see the big canvas of the whole thing, the whole cosmos,

00:19:15.988 --> 00:19:18.034
in a jeopardy.

00:19:18.034 --> 00:19:22.028
See what's happening to human beings today.

00:19:22.028 --> 00:19:27.308
And if they are to be saved, no use being unhappy.

00:19:27.308 --> 00:19:32.228
Like in France they said, "You cannot, Mother, say you are very happy person".

00:19:32.228 --> 00:19:34.013
I said, "Why?"

00:19:34.013 --> 00:19:40.649
"Because that means you are ignorant of the shocks."

00:19:41.028 --> 00:19:43.828
You see, I have to say  "I am very unhappy", you see.

00:19:44.028 --> 00:19:46.108
I have to paint some lines here to show you,

00:19:46.308 --> 00:19:48.788
that I'm very deeply concerned,

00:19:48.988 --> 00:19:52.868
worried about the whole world.

00:19:52.868 --> 00:19:55.348
But what is the solution have you got?

00:19:56.348 --> 00:19:58.908
You want me to be like you only?

00:19:59.268 --> 00:20:00.948
Is that the solution?

00:20:00.948 --> 00:20:03.988
That if ten people are weeping you also join them weeping?

00:20:04.188 --> 00:20:07.563
Is that the solution?

00:20:09.188 --> 00:20:15.468
And the one and only method that we have

00:20:16.428 --> 00:20:19.868
which has been already told and prescribed

00:20:19.948 --> 00:20:23.348
and has been prophesized,

00:20:24.428 --> 00:20:28.068
nobody seeks it.
No one seeks it.

00:20:28.428 --> 00:20:30.948
See now, in the Bible: you have to be born again,

00:20:31.148 --> 00:20:32.988
Christ is to be born in your heart.

00:20:33.188 --> 00:20:35.508
I mean, they do it, even before solving the whole drama

00:20:35.948 --> 00:20:38.068
they do it by giving you the second birth,

00:20:38.268 --> 00:20:40.868
by Christening you, so called.

00:20:42.108 --> 00:20:44.988
Hindus they believe without yoga is there's no sense.

00:20:45.188 --> 00:20:47.908
"Yoga kshema vahamyam" Krishna said all the time that,

00:20:48.108 --> 00:20:49.188
"You seek yoga". What are you seeking?

00:20:49.388 --> 00:20:51.388
All these treatises and all these big books

00:20:51.828 --> 00:20:54.828
and all the scriptures are aiming at what?

00:20:55.148 --> 00:20:59.158
Even, those who talked, "You must live with dharma
you must live a balanced life"

00:20:59.158 --> 00:21:01.908
For what? Why do you do it?

00:21:02.348 --> 00:21:03.868
What is the destination?

00:21:04.188 --> 00:21:07.348
And the destination is the Spirit.

00:21:08.108 --> 00:21:15.048
And today the background is so black,
is so dark,

00:21:15.148 --> 00:21:21.848
that this solution is
the end of everything.

00:21:22.268 --> 00:21:25.828
But do we realize this?

00:21:26.348 --> 00:21:31.308
On the contrary, the vicious circle builts in, within us,
all the time.

00:21:31.348 --> 00:21:35.348
"Oh, see how the world is miserable.

00:21:35.348 --> 00:21:38.357
Then how can I be happy?

00:21:40.308 --> 00:21:42.108
I'm so unhappy in life."

00:21:42.308 --> 00:21:45.000
I have yet to come across a person before Realization

00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.720
saying that, "I am a happy person".

00:21:49.348 --> 00:21:53.413
Maybe ego-oriented people might say, "I'm happy",
meaning "my ego is".

00:21:53.413 --> 00:21:56.245
You see, if he goes in a swanky car, or something like that,

00:21:56.245 --> 00:21:58.988
he's very happy, on top of the world.

00:21:59.148 --> 00:22:03.808
After ten minutes, you see him [looking sad]

00:22:04.308 --> 00:22:06.868
and this vicious circle is set in.

00:22:07.068 --> 00:22:10.848
This ego-oriented circle, or another one, it sets in.

00:22:11.028 --> 00:22:13.788
Another vicious circle and another vicious circle

00:22:13.988 --> 00:22:16.300
and another vicious circle,

00:22:16.308 --> 00:22:18.348
we go on from one to another,

00:22:18.348 --> 00:22:22.077
moving on the wheels after wheels,

00:22:23.028 --> 00:22:30.028
without realizing that, "Where we are going?"

00:22:32.068 --> 00:22:38.888
And this vicious circle has to be broken by one faith,

00:22:38.888 --> 00:22:45.308
by one understanding, that God is forgiveness.

00:22:45.308 --> 00:22:49.245
God is Love.

00:22:50.348 --> 00:22:54.868
When we feel love for anyone, without any lust and greed,

00:22:54.868 --> 00:22:59.248
then that is God’s love within us.

00:23:00.188 --> 00:23:06.841
That he is the embodiment of that pure love,

00:23:07.348 --> 00:23:11.148
which just loves,

00:23:11.148 --> 00:23:14.056
which has given you this beautiful human life

00:23:14.056 --> 00:23:17.885
and wants to make you more beautiful.

00:23:18.868 --> 00:23:21.308
He created all this creation for you

00:23:21.868 --> 00:23:26.580
and that he wants you to enjoy the bounties of this creation.

00:23:26.988 --> 00:23:29.828
He wants you to enjoy the citizen of his realm

00:23:30.028 --> 00:23:35.067
and the Kingdom of his Grace.

00:23:37.268 --> 00:23:39.948
Do we go to see someone

00:23:39.948 --> 00:23:43.348
who is highly placed, with a morose face? Do we?

00:23:44.148 --> 00:23:46.308
That day, we'll specially brush up the hair,

00:23:46.508 --> 00:23:48.908
see, make our hair into a beautiful thing,

00:23:49.108 --> 00:23:52.021
make our face nice, dress up well,

00:23:52.021 --> 00:23:54.377
It looks like we are well, you see.

00:23:55.348 --> 00:23:57.348
That’s outside.

00:23:59.308 --> 00:24:04.440
Inside, if you just feel how kind he is,

00:24:06.188 --> 00:24:10.753
how he has worked out meticulously

00:24:10.753 --> 00:24:13.753
in this blissful life of a human being.

00:24:14.028 --> 00:24:17.755
But think how much he has done for you!

00:24:18.028 --> 00:24:20.148
Instead of that, if you are all the time going to say,

00:24:20.348 --> 00:24:22.468
“I am very unhappy in life.”

00:24:22.908 --> 00:24:25.108
I mean, think of someone who does everything for you

00:24:25.308 --> 00:24:26.828
and you can just come back saying,

00:24:27.028 --> 00:24:29.108
“Oh, I am a very unhappy person.”

00:24:29.308 --> 00:24:30.868
What is he going to feel about it?

00:24:31.068 --> 00:24:32.868
No gratitude.

00:24:33.228 --> 00:24:36.498
Count your blessings one by one.

00:24:37.108 --> 00:24:38.348
That’s what one has to do,

00:24:38.948 --> 00:24:42.959
is to have complete understanding

00:24:42.959 --> 00:24:45.811
that he is God Almighty.

00:24:45.811 --> 00:24:48.837
He can do anything that he likes.

00:24:49.868 --> 00:24:55.459
and we are the recipient of His Allmighty.

00:24:56.228 --> 00:24:59.228
He is the Ocean of love,

00:24:59.428 --> 00:25:03.348
and we are the recipient of his love.

00:25:06.268 --> 00:25:12.565
Let us feel that, within ourselves, and understand logically with wisdom.

00:25:13.348 --> 00:25:16.028
If this sets into your mind,

00:25:16.228 --> 00:25:19.228
that’s the best conditioning I think human beings can have,

00:25:20.828 --> 00:25:22.828
what you call in Sanskrit as  "Susamskara",

00:25:23.028 --> 00:25:25.948
means the auspicious conditionings.

00:25:26.148 --> 00:25:29.308
You see, we don't have only conditioning and ego.

00:25:29.508 --> 00:25:34.482
We have third thing called also good conditioning.

00:25:34.988 --> 00:25:39.348
The conditionings that are ruining your chances of enjoyment,

00:25:39.908 --> 00:25:42.308
let it be brought round.

00:25:44.268 --> 00:25:47.148
And see for yourself, logically you can see

00:25:47.348 --> 00:25:51.905
how much is done for you.

00:25:54.308 --> 00:25:57.948
I mean none of the animals were that comfortable as you are.

00:25:58.148 --> 00:26:00.148
They don't know the idea of comfort. I mean they have never had a car,

00:26:00.348 --> 00:26:04.224
even chairs to sit down.

00:26:07.268 --> 00:26:10.348
It's easy to say, "Nice to be like animals" you see.

00:26:10.348 --> 00:26:12.788
But just go and see the way they live poor things!

00:26:12.988 --> 00:26:17.673
No. Even the king of the forest, how he lives, one should go and see.

00:26:18.388 --> 00:26:22.712
But he's happy. He's full of joy.

00:26:23.108 --> 00:26:25.108
Now he has to kill an animal, he'll kill it,

00:26:25.308 --> 00:26:28.864
and with his dignity eat one or two days, finished.

00:26:29.188 --> 00:26:31.148
Then he lives for ten days without food.

00:26:31.348 --> 00:26:34.508
Whenever he feels hungry he goes, he's not bothered.

00:26:35.228 --> 00:26:37.272
He doesn't feel guilty for killing anybody,

00:26:37.272 --> 00:26:41.144
he is hungry, he has to eat, he eats, finished.

00:26:42.468 --> 00:26:44.468
But human beings, as they are,

00:26:44.908 --> 00:26:50.468
they will eat someone without the need, and they'll feel guilty.

00:26:50.468 --> 00:26:53.884
This is the problem.

00:26:56.508 --> 00:26:59.868
He has made you with his own image.

00:27:00.068 --> 00:27:03.237
He's done everything beautifully.

00:27:03.868 --> 00:27:06.908
After Realization, you start understanding yourself

00:27:07.108 --> 00:27:09.988
and enjoying yourself as you enjoy others.

00:27:09.988 --> 00:27:13.621
The fragrance of others you start enjoying.

00:27:15.188 --> 00:27:21.348
Self-realization is the only way, you can get the light in.

00:27:21.348 --> 00:27:25.468
Enlightenment. Everybody talks of enlightenment, enlightenment.

00:27:25.948 --> 00:27:29.468
Enlightenment, means for some people is that you start jumping.

00:27:30.508 --> 00:27:34.348
Is it enlightenement to be abnormal like that?
Or take out your clothes?

00:27:34.348 --> 00:27:36.948
I mean, just think of it, how does it go into your brains,

00:27:37.148 --> 00:27:40.713
I can't understand, that doing all these nonsensical things,

00:27:40.713 --> 00:27:43.780
how can there be enlightenment?

00:27:44.028 --> 00:27:46.108
Or taking to alcohol, drinking or

00:27:46.308 --> 00:27:49.068
drugs or anything. How can it give you enlightenment?

00:27:49.268 --> 00:27:52.599
Has it given to anyone so far?

00:27:53.148 --> 00:27:56.188
It might be some sort of a funny strange experience  you might get,

00:27:56.188 --> 00:27:57.428
but not enlightenment.

00:27:57.908 --> 00:28:00.068
In enlightenment, you get integrated,

00:28:00.268 --> 00:28:02.788
you see your way through, you know where you are standing

00:28:02.988 --> 00:28:06.028
and how you are moving in relationship to others.

00:28:08.948 --> 00:28:14.570
So the illogical method, I would say, unwise method,

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:27.751
the way we deal with life, becomes a kind of a possession.

00:28:29.988 --> 00:28:35.148
And we are possessed by this negative force which is eating us up.

00:28:35.148 --> 00:28:39.468
And we go on living with that idea, enjoing that idea,

00:28:39.468 --> 00:28:44.118
that, we are miserable people, we are unhappy, we are helpless.

00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:47.099
I mean, I've seen people sitting on the streets and discussing,

00:28:47.099 --> 00:28:50.870
"Oh, thank God, there's going to be 8 stars coming in and we'll be all destroyed".

00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.910
I mean just imagine!

00:28:56.228 --> 00:28:59.228
But we have to think about the One who has created us.

00:28:59.428 --> 00:29:03.388
Is he waiting for your destruction, will he be happy with that?

00:29:05.868 --> 00:29:09.419
How much are you cooperating with Him?

00:29:09.988 --> 00:29:15.000
With what care, love, he has created us?

00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:16.674
With what hopes whatever it is,

00:29:16.674 --> 00:29:17.988
what does he want to do for us

00:29:18.268 --> 00:29:20.348
that you are sitting down and feeling guilty?

00:29:20.868 --> 00:29:23.068
And now, I have to tell openly,

00:29:23.268 --> 00:29:27.580
that it has come to you also through other vechicles,

00:29:28.188 --> 00:29:32.654
apart from the psychologists, psychoanalysts.

00:29:32.908 --> 00:29:35.308
Psychoanalysts: the other day we had a girl,

00:29:35.508 --> 00:29:36.948
she came to see Me.

00:29:37.148 --> 00:29:40.148
She's French. Her English was wonderful,

00:29:40.428 --> 00:29:41.828
and she said,

00:29:42.028 --> 00:29:45.068
"Horrible psychologists! They make me mad."

00:29:45.268 --> 00:29:48.108
"Why?" They said, "I have bad relationship with my mother,

00:29:48.308 --> 00:29:49.948
I have bad relationship with my father,

00:29:50.148 --> 00:29:52.028
bad relationship with every third person".

00:29:52.228 --> 00:29:54.308
I don't have that, I've absolutely pure relationship.

00:29:54.508 --> 00:29:56.308
They try to put that idea into my head

00:29:56.508 --> 00:29:58.908
that there's something abnormal, pathological about me

00:29:59.108 --> 00:30:01.055
which I am not!

00:30:01.308 --> 00:30:04.795
And they are making my brother's relationship also funny

00:30:04.795 --> 00:30:08.298
by telling him that I have bad relations with him.

00:30:09.188 --> 00:30:10.893
This is it.

00:30:11.228 --> 00:30:13.268
So they hit at the point of pure love,

00:30:13.468 --> 00:30:15.188
desintegrate you.

00:30:15.388 --> 00:30:18.148
You can't have good relationship with your own mother,

00:30:18.348 --> 00:30:22.453
with your own father, with your own sister, with your brother, and nobody.

00:30:22.453 --> 00:30:25.068
Because you cannot love except for, you are sex points.

00:30:25.268 --> 00:30:26.948
You have just relationship of sex.

00:30:26.948 --> 00:30:29.148
Even animals have better relationship then we have,

00:30:29.348 --> 00:30:31.428
if you have to accept the psychologists.

00:30:32.908 --> 00:30:37.268
And they take money to suggest
all these nonsensical ideas into your head.

00:30:37.268 --> 00:30:40.733
There are some here sitting. I will face them later on.

00:30:42.868 --> 00:30:45.788
This is how they're putting ideas into your heads

00:30:45.988 --> 00:30:50.988
that, "You are a person who has no, no purity

00:30:50.988 --> 00:30:52.388
and that you are a sinner,

00:30:52.828 --> 00:30:56.148
you are a damned person and any person you look upon,

00:30:56.348 --> 00:30:59.148
you have only sex relationships, nothing else.

00:30:59.348 --> 00:31:02.316
I mean are we sex points?

00:31:02.988 --> 00:31:06.964
With all this evolution God has made us into a sex point:

00:31:06.964 --> 00:31:12.929
that's what we have done to ourselves, reduced ourselves to that point only.

00:31:14.348 --> 00:31:18.228
He has created you in your own glory and in your own dignity.

00:31:20.988 --> 00:31:22.228
He's not created you

00:31:22.428 --> 00:31:25.868
to be only wasted like this

00:31:26.108 --> 00:31:29.828
Then the second thing that disintegrates us very much more,

00:31:30.348 --> 00:31:38.557
is the idea that we are here, you see,
to live in a gross way,

00:31:38.988 --> 00:31:43.228
somehow fighting, political, economic,

00:31:44.028 --> 00:31:49.308
all these nonsensical progress that we are making.

00:31:49.988 --> 00:31:54.290
And everything is explained,
all destructive forces are explained

00:31:54.543 --> 00:31:58.148
in the name of political or economic growth.

00:31:58.868 --> 00:32:03.108
I don't know if it is 'growth' or whatever it is,

00:32:03.188 --> 00:32:06.068
but definetely it is not love, take it from me.

00:32:06.268 --> 00:32:09.268
It is not love.

00:32:09.508 --> 00:32:14.848
That's why economics of God is to be understood.

00:32:15.148 --> 00:32:18.235
Politics of God is to be understood.

00:32:18.235 --> 00:32:22.494
And for human beings to understand it, they must have Self-realization.

00:32:23.028 --> 00:32:29.808
In his economics, generosity is the key-note.

00:32:30.308 --> 00:32:34.399
He enjoys his generosity.

00:32:35.228 --> 00:32:41.268
Material things are to express your generosity, isn't it?

00:32:42.148 --> 00:32:44.028
What are they for?

00:32:44.348 --> 00:32:48.148
The most enjoyable thing is to give,

00:32:48.348 --> 00:32:56.348
and when you give, you will see
your economic problems will be solved completely.

00:32:56.348 --> 00:32:59.068
Because you are here to become free,  no problems!

00:32:59.268 --> 00:33:03.522
The problems are because you want to grab.

00:33:05.348 --> 00:33:09.128
And once you start giving, you get it,
as much as you want,

00:33:09.128 --> 00:33:14.256
because if there's no outlet, there's no joy,

00:33:14.256 --> 00:33:17.176
there's no happiness, there's no release.

00:33:17.176 --> 00:33:20.388
from the material domination on you.

00:33:20.388 --> 00:33:22.908
But giving is the way

00:33:22.908 --> 00:33:26.468
you can get rid of that material domination on your head.

00:33:27.188 --> 00:33:29.437
That you give away.

00:33:30.868 --> 00:33:32.148
Give away everything that you have

00:33:32.348 --> 00:33:36.620
and you'll be surprised how it flows to you.

00:33:38.148 --> 00:33:40.988
Now, when I say, "It is fantastic the way it acts.

00:33:41.188 --> 00:33:43.108
Fantastic, the way it acts".

00:33:43.308 --> 00:33:45.828
Somehow, it’s easy to say,

00:33:46.028 --> 00:33:47.868
“It’s Mother is saying something

00:33:48.348 --> 00:33:53.148
which is something miraculous.”

00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:57.828
But what do you think of Moses
crossing the river, crossing the sea?

00:33:58.028 --> 00:33:59.828
You mean, it was miraculous,

00:34:00.028 --> 00:34:05.220
or it was a false stoy or what do you think of it?

00:34:06.028 --> 00:34:08.388
It was absolutely true,

00:34:08.868 --> 00:34:14.697
that he did cross the sea. With the help of God, he could do it.

00:34:16.148 --> 00:34:18.388
What about Christ walking on the water?

00:34:18.388 --> 00:34:20.948
He did because by his nature, he did it.

00:34:22.028 --> 00:34:25.068
What about all the miracles that were done by this Incarnation?

00:34:25.268 --> 00:34:30.802
It's absolutely true, I'm here to prove all of them.

00:34:32.028 --> 00:34:33.948
But you must get your Realization.

00:34:34.148 --> 00:34:36.028
Not because that I cannot prove it,

00:34:36.228 --> 00:34:40.268
You must enter into that realm of awareness.
Otherwise, they cannot prove it.

00:34:40.268 --> 00:34:43.028
It's true. The other day,
somebody was saying that Rama is a fiction.

00:34:43.028 --> 00:34:45.000
I said, "How do you say?"

00:34:45.348 --> 00:34:46.988
He said, "Because, it looks like a fiction".

00:34:47.188 --> 00:34:50.868
I said, "To human mind, they cannot understand God,

00:34:50.868 --> 00:34:55.068
who has millions and millions of hands and eyes

00:34:55.068 --> 00:34:57.108
to work out His plans".

00:34:57.108 --> 00:35:01.908
So, naturally Rama is a fiction.
Krishna is a fiction. Everybody is a fiction!

00:35:01.908 --> 00:35:06.186
Because we ourselves are fictitious, I think.

00:35:07.308 --> 00:35:09.468
It's not that it is a fiction

00:35:09.468 --> 00:35:13.228
but we are incapable of grasping that is miraculous, which is divine.

00:35:13.428 --> 00:35:15.988
and that's why we just call it, "Oh".

00:35:17.348 --> 00:35:21.148
No, everything is true, believe me, everything is true.

00:35:21.348 --> 00:35:23.868
Now, Rama' s case, let's take it.

00:35:23.868 --> 00:35:25.868
Simple to be like Rama, all right?

00:35:26.348 --> 00:35:28.028
"Rama is a fiction".

00:35:28.228 --> 00:35:32.348
Many of our Indians are very anglicised now, very westernized you see.

00:35:32.348 --> 00:35:35.154
So, they want to say, "We don't believe in all these fictions",

00:35:35.154 --> 00:35:38.205
so they're becoming English.

00:35:38.868 --> 00:35:43.868
For them, to become English is the last epitome,
it's the last word.

00:35:43.868 --> 00:35:46.108
"So we don't believe in Rama, nothing, you see." All right,

00:35:46.308 --> 00:35:49.148
it's all our old style of thinking.

00:35:49.148 --> 00:35:51.868
But he exists and he's within us!

00:35:51.868 --> 00:35:55.508
It can be proved with your Kundalini awakening.

00:35:55.508 --> 00:36:00.772
The person who has got asthma, who suffers from asthma,

00:36:00.772 --> 00:36:03.693
catches on the right heart.

00:36:03.693 --> 00:36:07.908
You have to take the name of Rama to cure him.

00:36:07.908 --> 00:36:13.348
Nothing else can cure him. It's simple.

00:36:13.348 --> 00:36:16.068
The Kundalini stops here.

00:36:16.268 --> 00:36:18.908
Many people don't believe in Christ.

00:36:19.108 --> 00:36:24.631
"We don't believe in Christ". But you don't believe in Christ, but under what circumstaces?

00:36:24.631 --> 00:36:29.071
Why, why don't you believe in Christ?

00:36:29.908 --> 00:36:33.472
"Because you see, we don't think he existed, how can it be possible?"

00:36:33.472 --> 00:36:37.933
"We don't believe in Moses, we don't believe in Christ, we don't believe in anybody". All right.

00:36:37.933 --> 00:36:41.195
Do you believe in yourself?

00:36:41.195 --> 00:36:44.002
Perhaps that is missing.

00:36:44.348 --> 00:36:47.953
Because the Self is not there.

00:36:47.953 --> 00:36:51.073
If you know your Self, you should believe in them.

00:36:51.073 --> 00:36:54.908
Because when Kundalini rises, at this point you'll be amazed,

00:36:55.148 --> 00:36:57.948
at this point, whether you believe in Christ or not,

00:36:58.148 --> 00:36:59.948
at this point,

00:37:00.148 --> 00:37:03.908
at the Agnya chakra, where you see the crossing of it,

00:37:03.908 --> 00:37:06.988
you have to say Lord's Prayer.

00:37:06.988 --> 00:37:10.148
You have to take the name of Christ.
Otherwise, Kundalini doesn't rise.

00:37:10.148 --> 00:37:12.908
Now most of the people who are here, who are Realized, know this.

00:37:13.108 --> 00:37:15.655
It has been proved to them.

00:37:16.348 --> 00:37:20.988
In the Nabhi, in this Void,
if it is hanging, you have to take the name of Moses.

00:37:20.988 --> 00:37:24.671
Whether you are a Jew or not, or a hater of Jews
or whatever you may be,

00:37:24.671 --> 00:37:30.324
you have to take the name of a Jew, of Moses.

00:37:31.348 --> 00:37:35.687
The whole movement of the Kundalini is to intergrate

00:37:35.687 --> 00:37:41.348
all the truths which are treated as miraculous,
some people think it's falsehood,

00:37:41.348 --> 00:37:43.308
it's good for nothing, useless.

00:37:43.871 --> 00:37:49.052
All these things are proved by the movement of the Kundalini

00:37:49.052 --> 00:37:52.168
in your central path.

00:37:52.988 --> 00:37:58.535
And the greatest of greatest thing
that is proved, is that God exists.

00:37:58.535 --> 00:38:02.348
Not only exists but he's active,

00:38:02.348 --> 00:38:06.188
that he does everything for us,

00:38:06.188 --> 00:38:10.296
that it is he who is the truth and it 's his power of Brahma,

00:38:10.296 --> 00:38:12.988
is the truth, the rest is all falsehood and nonsense.

00:38:13.908 --> 00:38:18.148
It works in all details too, in small details also.

00:38:19.348 --> 00:38:21.828
Now Sahaja Yogis have seen the miracle of Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:22.028 --> 00:38:23.828
they cannot explain it.

00:38:24.028 --> 00:38:26.148
You cannot explain also.

00:38:26.148 --> 00:38:28.108
When you become Realised, you are surprised

00:38:28.308 --> 00:38:30.613
how you are helped, how you meet people,

00:38:30.613 --> 00:38:33.195
how you get to things, how things work out,

00:38:33.195 --> 00:38:36.740
and how it works out so smoothly, you just can't imagine!

00:38:37.108 --> 00:38:43.348
Even to the smallest detail it can work out beautifully.

00:38:43.348 --> 00:38:47.108
But you have to establish yourself in the kingdom of God.

00:38:47.308 --> 00:38:49.960
Not with these fanatical ideas,

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.221
like you go to the Catholic church and they say,

00:38:52.221 --> 00:38:55.653
"Now you must confess".
I don't know from where did they get this idea!

00:38:55.653 --> 00:38:59.171
I don't think Christ would have ever said that,
"You'd better go and confess to these priests",

00:38:59.171 --> 00:39:01.331
who are not even Realized souls.

00:39:02.188 --> 00:39:06.144
What are they going to do by confession?

00:39:07.268 --> 00:39:09.828
And then the answer came to me from a priest.

00:39:10.028 --> 00:39:12.148
I've asked him, he's a nice man, he's a Realized soul now,

00:39:12.348 --> 00:39:14.388
and he is working for Sahaja Yoga.

00:39:14.868 --> 00:39:17.968
But he told me, "The reason is in the Bible it's written,

00:39:17.988 --> 00:39:19.948
that, 'Whatever is corrected on this earth,

00:39:20.148 --> 00:39:22.048
will be corrected in the heaven'.

00:39:22.148 --> 00:39:24.148
That's why you'd better correct it by telling to the priest."

00:39:24.348 --> 00:39:27.008
Now, by any logical means do you think these priests

00:39:27.028 --> 00:39:31.148
can help you by telling them anything?

00:39:31.988 --> 00:39:37.268
Whatever is to be correced
on this earth is your Kundalini and your chakras.

00:39:38.148 --> 00:39:41.588
If the language of the Bible has been,

00:39:41.828 --> 00:39:43.308
especially the Old Testament,

00:39:43.508 --> 00:39:48.868
has been extremely guarded, it was security measure.

00:39:48.868 --> 00:39:53.268
Like the Tree of Life
is nothing but the Kundalini which is enlightened.

00:39:53.268 --> 00:39:57.068
Absolutely, it is that, it looks like that, like a tree.

00:39:57.268 --> 00:39:59.468
The other day, we were having program - I think today only,

00:39:59.908 --> 00:40:02.148
my children showed me, "Look, the Kundalini".

00:40:02.348 --> 00:40:05.868
I went and saw they were describing about Moses something,

00:40:05.868 --> 00:40:08.693
perhaps, and this was the Tree of Life, they said.

00:40:08.693 --> 00:40:12.741
And my children, grandchildren said, "See, the Kundalini".

00:40:14.108 --> 00:40:20.868
The language they used, may be for security measures made,

00:40:20.868 --> 00:40:24.908
but not the word,

00:40:24.908 --> 00:40:28.988
if it is now changed by human beings, it's false.

00:40:28.988 --> 00:40:31.988
Human beings can change words, that's a different point,

00:40:32.188 --> 00:40:35.348
but you can see, in Sahaja Yoga you can see what is changed,

00:40:35.828 --> 00:40:39.068
what is wrong, which is falsehood. You can see all these things.

00:40:39.268 --> 00:40:41.028
So, to disintegrate you,

00:40:41.228 --> 00:40:45.068
these things are again created in the name of religion, so-called.

00:40:46.014 --> 00:40:47.785
I mean these people are there for God

00:40:47.785 --> 00:40:50.874
or for making you feel guilty?

00:40:51.228 --> 00:40:56.948
Like, say Jews think that Christ was not a saviour.

00:40:56.948 --> 00:41:01.800
If they are still waiting for two hundred years. It's not true.

00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:05.268
He's the One, without Him you cannot raise the Kundalini.

00:41:05.468 --> 00:41:08.268
One should understand that he's the Mahavishnu described.

00:41:08.771 --> 00:41:10.451
But if I say something,

00:41:10.451 --> 00:41:12.948
that doesn't mean that you should believe Me. Not at all.

00:41:12.948 --> 00:41:16.108
But you should see for yourself because if you are interested,

00:41:16.308 --> 00:41:18.148
in the emancipation of the whole world,

00:41:18.348 --> 00:41:22.868
you should not get stuck on one,

00:41:22.868 --> 00:41:24.108
stuck on to one thing,

00:41:24.308 --> 00:41:26.868
and say, "This is the truth and this is the truth".

00:41:26.868 --> 00:41:28.468
No, seek for yourself what is the truth.

00:41:28.908 --> 00:41:30.908
And you'll be amazed that they are all one.

00:41:31.108 --> 00:41:33.028
Like Christ has said, "Those who are not against me

00:41:33.228 --> 00:41:36.259
are people who are with me".

00:41:37.348 --> 00:41:41.028
Moses and Christ are one, which can be proved.

00:41:42.348 --> 00:41:43.868
Same in other religions.

00:41:44.068 --> 00:41:46.068
So religion is another way to disintegrate you.

00:41:46.268 --> 00:41:50.772
You hate each other. Fundamentalists, fighting for what?

00:41:51.188 --> 00:41:53.028
Fundamental difference you know.

00:41:53.228 --> 00:41:54.600
Can you imagine?

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:58.068
What is the fundamental of these religions? It’s their Spirit, isn’t it?

00:41:58.268 --> 00:42:02.148
Is it a difference between the Spirit of one and another?

00:42:02.148 --> 00:42:07.879
Fundamentals are that God is one.  He's created us

00:42:07.879 --> 00:42:09.000
and what are you fighting about?

00:42:09.251 --> 00:42:10.811
Fundamental difference, you know? Fundamental difference,

00:42:10.988 --> 00:42:13.813
when there exists no difference at all.

00:42:14.188 --> 00:42:16.108
So we have psychologists,

00:42:16.308 --> 00:42:21.719
we have religious leaders, teaching us how to fight and hate God

00:42:21.719 --> 00:42:26.800
and your fellow being, in the name of God.

00:42:27.348 --> 00:42:30.348
This is another disintegration that sets into us.

00:42:30.828 --> 00:42:36.374
So, you people who are thinking, should understand

00:42:36.374 --> 00:42:38.828
that anything that creates such limitation within us

00:42:39.028 --> 00:42:40.948
any kind of fanaticism,

00:42:41.148 --> 00:42:44.308
is dangerous not only to you but to the whole society,

00:42:44.508 --> 00:42:46.148
and if you support it, even this much,

00:42:46.348 --> 00:42:48.794
you are supporting their destruction.

00:42:52.868 --> 00:42:54.908
With Sahaja Yoga we can establish,

00:42:54.908 --> 00:42:57.188
that anybody who is a fanatic,

00:42:57.388 --> 00:43:00.308
has problems and sufferes from many diseases

00:43:00.508 --> 00:43:02.148
which normal people don't.

00:43:04.348 --> 00:43:06.988
Then there are another type of people who

00:43:06.988 --> 00:43:10.228
say that, "All right, we don't believe in God.

00:43:10.228 --> 00:43:13.108
Because how can God create this fanaticism?"

00:43:13.348 --> 00:43:15.148
How can you blame God for fanaticism?

00:43:15.348 --> 00:43:17.228
I just can't understand. He never created it.

00:43:17.428 --> 00:43:20.828
Actually, he never created any difference between you people,

00:43:20.828 --> 00:43:24.348
just a variety, just to make it beautiful, that's all.

00:43:24.348 --> 00:43:27.148
See, he didn't create England separately, this separately,

00:43:27.348 --> 00:43:30.868
to that extent the way you think. But he created them

00:43:30.868 --> 00:43:34.096
because they are different organs in the body of God.

00:43:35.188 --> 00:43:37.428
Do we take out an eye, and say "This is an eye

00:43:37.428 --> 00:43:41.558
so I do not have anything to do with it". Can we?

00:43:42.108 --> 00:43:43.868
It's like that!

00:43:44.068 --> 00:43:46.908
It's simple like that, it's so simple.

00:43:46.908 --> 00:43:50.988
The truth is so simple and so starkly lit before you:

00:43:50.988 --> 00:43:57.657
that we are doing all these things, fighting, quarelling,

00:43:57.657 --> 00:44:02.690
all the time within ourselves and without.

00:44:02.988 --> 00:44:06.028
Now, for that Self-realization,

00:44:06.228 --> 00:44:09.268
God has placed this wonderful thing, Kundalini within us,

00:44:09.468 --> 00:44:13.348
very beautifully, in the best possible position.

00:44:13.348 --> 00:44:16.348
It could not be better anywhere.

00:44:16.348 --> 00:44:19.188
To create this happening within us, in our awareness,

00:44:19.388 --> 00:44:23.108
the Kundalini has to rise and give us Realization.

00:44:23.108 --> 00:44:25.868
Now, people ask questions to God also, can be.

00:44:25.868 --> 00:44:30.408
They can say, "Why did he do it?
Why didn't he make us wise, to begin with?"

00:44:30.408 --> 00:44:31.308
There are many like that.

00:44:31.308 --> 00:44:33.108
He should have just make us wise.

00:44:33.308 --> 00:44:37.401
Just from monkeys, dipped into some wisdom powder

00:44:37.401 --> 00:44:39.623
and pushed us out as wise people

00:44:39.623 --> 00:44:42.018
living in the kingdom of God.

00:44:43.228 --> 00:44:48.828
"Why didn't he do it in our evolution,
why did he make us so stupid?"

00:44:48.828 --> 00:44:52.348
One can say to God, you see,
"Why did You create these problems?", talking to God.

00:44:52.348 --> 00:44:55.028
But who are we to ask Him questions? You see, he does what he likes.

00:44:55.228 --> 00:45:00.584
But, there's a reason.

00:45:00.584 --> 00:45:05.840
If you have to enter into that complete freedom,
you must know how to be free.

00:45:06.188 --> 00:45:09.148
If you are just abandoned people, you have no sense of freedom,

00:45:09.348 --> 00:45:13.694
you don't know how to be choosy about the good and the bad,

00:45:13.694 --> 00:45:19.277
and you do not understand the value of your own wisdom.

00:45:19.868 --> 00:45:22.268
And if you are put in charge, imagine,

00:45:22.468 --> 00:45:25.988
some mad people put in charge in government, what will happen to you?

00:45:26.348 --> 00:45:30.000
So you have to grow up to that point to feel your freedom

00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.746
that in your freedom, you are righteous.

00:45:32.746 --> 00:45:36.939
In that freedom, you are kind.

00:45:36.939 --> 00:45:45.308
In that freedom, you are absolutely balanced.

00:45:46.348 --> 00:45:50.148
And when that happens to you,

00:45:50.148 --> 00:45:52.908
then only the higher freedom is given to you.

00:45:53.108 --> 00:45:55.348
Because that's completely free.

00:45:55.348 --> 00:45:59.348
And once that high freedom comes into you,

00:45:59.348 --> 00:46:07.190
then you can feel the responsibility,

00:46:07.190 --> 00:46:16.078
the responsibility to be responsible for your freedom.

00:46:16.948 --> 00:46:20.200
To put this beautiful responsability onto you

00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.108
you have to know how to use your freedom.

00:46:22.308 --> 00:46:24.988
This is only transition which has led all of us,

00:46:25.188 --> 00:46:27.148
into this feeling 'guilty business',

00:46:27.348 --> 00:46:29.908
or this agression. Can you imagine?

00:46:30.108 --> 00:46:33.963
You could have waited for a while

00:46:33.963 --> 00:46:37.438
without feeling so sick.

00:46:37.828 --> 00:46:43.631
I mean, sometimes I feel the people are going for a funeral,

00:46:43.631 --> 00:46:46.868
the way they look miserable.

00:46:46.868 --> 00:46:51.228
The rest are busy creating such people.

00:46:51.228 --> 00:46:54.655
So there are only two types of people, if one sees:

00:46:54.655 --> 00:47:00.368
some who are being victims and another who are victimizing.

00:47:00.908 --> 00:47:04.828
So, to have the balance, in the center, to stand in the center,

00:47:05.348 --> 00:47:10.313
God has created this little tide

00:47:10.313 --> 00:47:13.021
where you have to just learn how to weigh your freedom.

00:47:13.021 --> 00:47:15.000
He gave you freedom to know,.

00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.188
And this freedom is the only thing that has created,

00:47:17.388 --> 00:47:20.644
all the problems you face, not God.

00:47:20.644 --> 00:47:26.188
God hasn't created any problems for you. No. He wanted to make a very smooth ascent.

00:47:26.188 --> 00:47:29.268
He's made your machines so beautifully.

00:47:29.268 --> 00:47:33.553
Despite all this, you do get your Realization, no doubt.

00:47:33.553 --> 00:47:37.148
But because of habits, you may run down again to it;

00:47:37.148 --> 00:47:39.868
again you may have an ascent, again go down.

00:47:39.868 --> 00:47:41.988
It happens with some people, doesn't matter.

00:47:41.988 --> 00:47:46.228
But if you are steady, it is going to work out.

00:47:46.228 --> 00:47:48.996
It has to work out.

00:47:48.996 --> 00:47:53.318
If God has to save his creation, he has to do it.

00:47:53.318 --> 00:47:59.748
Only thing: how many are going to cooperate
and take advantage of his compassion is to be seen.

00:47:59.748 --> 00:48:08.961
That is the most important thing,
how many are going to be wise to see to their own advantage,

00:48:08.961 --> 00:48:12.068
to their own ascent.

00:48:12.068 --> 00:48:15.348
It's the only choice.

00:48:15.348 --> 00:48:19.519
May God bless you.

00:48:20.348 --> 00:48:23.028
If you have any questions you may ask me,

00:48:23.028 --> 00:48:27.897
and then I will do the Realization.

00:48:30.868 --> 00:48:34.228
Mother, how the negative force is created?

00:48:34.868 --> 00:48:35.948
What's it?

00:48:35.948 --> 00:48:38.508
How this negative force is created to begin within?

00:48:38.988 --> 00:48:40.988
What is he saying?

00:48:40.988 --> 00:48:44.753
How the negative force is created, to begin with?

00:48:45.661 --> 00:48:49.854
By the great human beings.

00:48:52.108 --> 00:48:57.228
Who has created atom bomb? Same type.

00:48:57.228 --> 00:49:01.348
From the very beginning,
they started creating this negative force.

00:49:01.348 --> 00:49:04.442
All kinds.

00:49:05.188 --> 00:49:12.948
In seeking, as I told you, in seeking,
they set in this vicious circle

00:49:12.948 --> 00:49:16.948
which started creating.
And the, you see, this mistake is small.

00:49:17.148 --> 00:49:22.708
What is the mistake in separating a hydrogen atom, isn't it?

00:49:22.708 --> 00:49:24.988
Just they did it, you see, for fun sake maybe.

00:49:24.988 --> 00:49:27.619
I don't know why they did it.

00:49:27.948 --> 00:49:31.228
But now, that will become like a devil
sitting on everybody's head, in everybody.

00:49:31.228 --> 00:49:35.348
Thank God only, whatever they create frightens them, thank God.

00:49:35.348 --> 00:49:37.948
So they are not going to use it, but

00:49:38.148 --> 00:49:42.412
who has created that? Human beings.

00:49:42.412 --> 00:49:44.410
In ignorance, they have done it.

00:49:44.410 --> 00:49:46.669
As a Mother, I have to say that.

00:49:46.669 --> 00:49:49.188
I cannot say that it was deliberated.

00:49:49.388 --> 00:49:53.448
It's a dangerous situation there.

00:49:57.868 --> 00:50:00.948
It's obvious, in your lifetime, people have created atom bombs.

00:50:01.148 --> 00:50:04.043
What was the need?

00:50:04.868 --> 00:50:06.502
I mean, for a stranger like me,

00:50:06.502 --> 00:50:09.001
I don't understand what is the need to create an atom bomb,

00:50:09.001 --> 00:50:11.829
what is the need?

00:50:14.028 --> 00:50:16.763
Who are they to create this kind of a democracy

00:50:16.763 --> 00:50:19.973
and this kind of communism,

00:50:19.973 --> 00:50:23.148
and this kind of all nonsensical institutions,

00:50:23.348 --> 00:50:26.498
which just make the people fight?

00:50:34.308 --> 00:50:36.148
Any other questions please?

00:50:36.348 --> 00:50:38.388
And you can't blame God for that.

00:50:38.868 --> 00:50:42.861
At least, God didn't tell you to make atom bomb.

00:50:50.228 --> 00:50:52.148
Any other question please?

00:50:53.068 --> 00:50:54.068
I have got one.

00:50:54.268 --> 00:50:54.868
Yes.

00:50:55.068 --> 00:50:57.148
Why do you think, are people

00:50:57.348 --> 00:51:00.148
all the time so afraid of losing things,

00:51:00.348 --> 00:51:05.108
of losing their ego, of losing their relatives, or-

00:51:05.868 --> 00:51:09.043
but not losing but -

00:51:09.348 --> 00:51:12.348
losing their - what they have built up in themselves,

00:51:12.828 --> 00:51:14.948
their identity that they think they are.

00:51:15.148 --> 00:51:17.148
They are afraid of losing it.

00:51:17.868 --> 00:51:19.308
Why they are afraid?

00:51:19.508 --> 00:51:20.268
Yes.

00:51:20.468 --> 00:51:22.948
They have been cooked up like that, you know.

00:51:23.348 --> 00:51:25.868
They are told like that, they are conditioned like that.

00:51:26.148 --> 00:51:27.388
What can they do?

00:51:27.868 --> 00:51:29.948
You see, that all the time, if somebody tells you

00:51:30.148 --> 00:51:32.148
that you are going to lose, "It's very precious, very precious",

00:51:32.348 --> 00:51:34.348
you see, you'll hold on to it.

00:51:34.948 --> 00:51:37.948
But one must know in growth, in life,

00:51:37.948 --> 00:51:40.188
when a flower becomes a fruit,

00:51:40.388 --> 00:51:43.348
it looses flower for fruit to come,

00:51:43.348 --> 00:51:46.148
to grow into new.

00:51:46.148 --> 00:51:52.772
When an egg breaks,
its shell falls off and the bird comes out.

00:51:52.772 --> 00:51:57.128
It's not a loosing, it is growth.

00:51:58.028 --> 00:52:04.651
You have been frightened, what can you do?
From the very beginning.

00:52:05.348 --> 00:52:09.174
What is there to lose
if you are not holding on to anything?

00:52:10.228 --> 00:52:11.388
All right?

00:52:11.828 --> 00:52:14.028
What is there to lose, you just tell me?

00:52:14.268 --> 00:52:16.148
If you're not holding onto something,

00:52:16.348 --> 00:52:19.355
then, if there's no catch on anything,

00:52:19.400 --> 00:52:23.115
what are you going to loose? You are just enjoing on giving.

00:52:25.988 --> 00:52:28.836
What do we take from here?

00:52:29.348 --> 00:52:31.828
When we go our hands are like this,

00:52:32.188 --> 00:52:34.754
when we come our hands are like this.

00:52:35.028 --> 00:52:37.593
Our hands are open, when we go.

00:52:37.593 --> 00:52:40.948
We can't take anything, we confess it.

00:52:40.948 --> 00:52:46.237
Even ego we leave here. Everything we leave here.

00:52:48.388 --> 00:52:50.988
All myths, so many myths have been created,

00:52:51.188 --> 00:52:53.028
and man is living with the mythical ideas.

00:52:53.228 --> 00:52:56.068
I tell you he's living, he's compromizing with the myths.

00:52:56.268 --> 00:52:58.507
All the time, he doesn't accept a myth

00:52:58.507 --> 00:53:00.868
then they say, "He's not a sane person".

00:53:00.868 --> 00:53:03.188
All sorts of, and then many, many myths set in.

00:53:03.388 --> 00:53:07.028
People start copying others, you see, blindly.

00:53:07.308 --> 00:53:12.028
It's all, you see, to an ignorant person like me,

00:53:12.028 --> 00:53:17.576
it's something I just don't understand; what is the need?

00:53:20.068 --> 00:53:23.800
But I'm talking of the real world where you have to enter into,

00:53:23.988 --> 00:53:25.308
it is reality.

00:53:25.508 --> 00:53:30.800
And do you know? Reality is love.

00:53:30.988 --> 00:53:33.000
It's love.

00:53:33.348 --> 00:53:37.735
But not the way human beings understand love.

00:53:37.735 --> 00:53:41.228
But love which flows,

00:53:41.228 --> 00:53:45.000
which thinks, which cooperates,

00:53:45.028 --> 00:53:49.165
and generates the feeling of joy.

00:53:50.268 --> 00:53:53.468
It's a very different world that we have to enter into.

00:53:54.148 --> 00:53:59.108
But what will you lose? What have you got?

00:53:59.108 --> 00:54:02.740
What you have that is lost?

00:54:02.988 --> 00:54:04.108
That's your Spirit.

00:54:04.308 --> 00:54:08.285
And what you don't have, you are holding on to it.

00:54:09.068 --> 00:54:11.028
There's nothing to be lost, it's very true,

00:54:11.028 --> 00:54:14.712
they are so fightened, you don't know.

00:54:14.712 --> 00:54:18.793
Very frightened.

00:54:22.028 --> 00:54:27.603
They are made like that, what can you do?

00:54:27.948 --> 00:54:29.988
But they lose everything to a person

00:54:30.188 --> 00:54:33.348
who knows how to handle this condition in the real sense.

00:54:34.028 --> 00:54:37.296
You can just become like a cabage with some people.

00:54:37.296 --> 00:54:40.498
Really, they can make you a cabbage.

00:54:41.828 --> 00:54:45.000
In the name of God, in the name of enlightenement, they can.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:47.727
Yes, they can harm you.

00:54:51.868 --> 00:54:53.553
Then they are not worried.

00:54:53.553 --> 00:54:56.108
I don't know how they get this confidence with that.

00:54:56.108 --> 00:54:59.108
Like the other day,
we had somebody from 'Charismatic Movement'.

00:54:59.308 --> 00:55:01.348
You remember that? Norman.

00:55:01.348 --> 00:55:03.948
And I hope you have not taken any

00:55:04.148 --> 00:55:06.028
photographe of him, did you?

00:55:06.028 --> 00:55:08.028
We were also worried about him.

00:55:08.228 --> 00:55:12.068
And he went into such movements of the body,

00:55:12.068 --> 00:55:15.068
for at least half an hour

00:55:15.268 --> 00:55:18.348
he was so much in a very funny type of epilepsy, you see.

00:55:19.135 --> 00:55:23.492
All his body was moving and terrible he was crying, weeping

00:55:23.492 --> 00:55:26.237
he fell down on the ground, you can't imagine.

00:55:27.348 --> 00:55:30.108
And he said, "This I've been doing and so many are doing like this,

00:55:30.308 --> 00:55:32.068
and they think they are getting into Holy Ghost".

00:55:32.268 --> 00:55:34.108
I said, "Holy Ghost?

00:55:34.308 --> 00:55:37.148
What an unholy thing it is to be like that".

00:55:38.348 --> 00:55:42.439
Holy Ghost? Can you imagine?

00:55:50.348 --> 00:55:52.308
He wanted to get out of it. He could not.

00:55:52.508 --> 00:55:53.908
Now, he's all right, perfectly all right.

00:55:54.108 --> 00:55:56.108
He's like a small little child.

00:55:56.308 --> 00:56:00.000
I wish you could see that, John.

00:56:00.068 --> 00:56:04.348
You should have seen it, really.

00:56:04.348 --> 00:56:09.437
Shocking it was. Much worse than TM, I tell you, much worse.

00:56:10.028 --> 00:56:14.348
Because the movement was so fast,

00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:18.108
unrhythmic, big fast movements.

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:22.599
The whole body was gesticulating and this was too much.

00:56:27.108 --> 00:56:30.501
But he got cured.

00:56:36.948 --> 00:56:41.313
Any other question?

00:56:46.508 --> 00:56:51.297
Ego is one problem, I must say, it's a very big problem.

00:56:52.108 --> 00:56:55.327
And for ego,

00:56:55.327 --> 00:56:59.348
like some people say,  "Mother, why You should do it?"

00:56:59.348 --> 00:57:02.028
I said, "You better do it, it's very good idea.

00:57:02.228 --> 00:57:04.526
I would like to retire".

00:57:04.526 --> 00:57:07.451
But you can't do it, what to do? You see.

00:57:07.451 --> 00:57:10.853
All right, now you do so many things, I don´t feel bad.

00:57:10.853 --> 00:57:13.216
Why should you feel bad if I know something.

00:57:13.216 --> 00:57:16.256
You know one thing I know is to awaken, awakening of the Kundalini.

00:57:16.256 --> 00:57:18.679
Now, what can I do about it?

00:57:19.148 --> 00:57:21.852
Are you going to crucify me for that?

00:57:25.348 --> 00:57:29.198
I mean I don't get any - what you call -

00:57:29.198 --> 00:57:31.534
title from your government for that,

00:57:31.534 --> 00:57:34.098
no payment, nothing.

00:57:36.908 --> 00:57:38.148
So why? Why to feel bad?

00:57:38.348 --> 00:57:40.028
I mean I will make you the same way.

00:57:40.228 --> 00:57:43.148
You will raise other's Kundalini also.

00:57:43.348 --> 00:57:45.148
So what's the harm?

00:57:45.348 --> 00:57:49.108
You will, of course, you are going to do it yourself.

00:57:49.108 --> 00:57:51.788
Supposing I have the keys with me: if I give you the keys

00:57:51.988 --> 00:57:54.108
will you feel your ego will be hurt or not?

00:57:54.348 --> 00:57:57.028
See, if I am a trustee, I have to give you isn't it?

00:57:57.988 --> 00:58:01.308
Do you feel your ego hurt, if I give you your keys?

00:58:01.308 --> 00:58:04.437
It's so simple as that.

00:58:08.348 --> 00:58:11.108
This is your own, this is your own property, I've got the keys,

00:58:11.308 --> 00:58:14.613
I'll give you because I have got them, now what to do?

00:58:14.908 --> 00:58:17.711
If you have them, it's very good,

00:58:17.711 --> 00:58:20.539
You never had, so I'm giving you.

00:58:22.348 --> 00:58:26.348
What is there to feel hurt about that part?

00:58:26.348 --> 00:58:28.068
Actually, I have to work very hard.

00:58:28.068 --> 00:58:29.920
You don't have to work hard at all.

00:58:29.988 --> 00:58:33.078
To begin with, then up to you.

00:58:40.908 --> 00:58:43.558
Any other question?

00:58:45.188 --> 00:58:47.508
I would like Sahaja Yogis to ask me questions,

00:58:47.988 --> 00:58:51.028
for one reason, because when they are faced with life, and

00:58:51.228 --> 00:58:52.868
other people will ask them questions,

00:58:52.868 --> 00:58:55.976
so any questions which you have not been able to answer

00:58:55.976 --> 00:59:00.000
you can ask me and then we have our Realization.

00:59:03.068 --> 00:59:04.013
Mother?

00:59:04.013 --> 00:59:04.992
Yes?

00:59:04.992 --> 00:59:08.468
What is the approach towards the Christian Church?

00:59:08.468 --> 00:59:09.828
What is it?

00:59:10.028 --> 00:59:13.868
What it's our approach, the line, for the Christian Church?

00:59:13.868 --> 00:59:17.063
Have pity for them.

00:59:21.228 --> 00:59:25.679
You see, I took my birth in the Christian religion, in India,

00:59:26.348 --> 00:59:29.148
and first, the Hindus, you see, they were very upset

00:59:29.348 --> 00:59:33.992
that, "How could She take birth in a Christian religion?"

00:59:33.992 --> 00:59:37.103
I mean, so-called Christian religion.

00:59:37.348 --> 00:59:45.000
And I must tell you, I was baptized forcibly by a Lutheran Church.

00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.823
All right?

00:59:49.068 --> 00:59:55.891
The simple answer is that Christians are the most fanatic people.

00:59:56.268 --> 01:00:00.000
And the Indian Christians are the worst

01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:03.619
because they think Christ was born in England.

01:00:04.148 --> 01:00:06.948
Really they think so. You see, if you have an English name

01:00:07.148 --> 01:00:09.948
then you are a real Christian. Otherwise, you are not.

01:00:09.948 --> 01:00:13.348
You can't imagine how ignorant they are.

01:00:13.348 --> 01:00:17.348
And how the Christans are most fanatic. It looks funny but it is so.

01:00:18.188 --> 01:00:23.948
Because their fanatism is so beautifully managed.

01:00:23.948 --> 01:00:27.348
It is not like Khomeini is, which is stark open fanaticism.

01:00:28.148 --> 01:00:32.068
You know, Khomeini is that and he has to accept he is.

01:00:32.068 --> 01:00:36.988
But this way it is very well polished, you know, beautifully done.

01:00:36.988 --> 01:00:40.174
Others can be said they are stones

01:00:40.174 --> 01:00:42.988
but this is like a diamond artificially made.

01:00:43.348 --> 01:00:48.470
They do social work this Christian way.

01:00:48.470 --> 01:00:51.108
Now for example, if you ask somebody the way in England,

01:00:51.308 --> 01:00:53.760
it's a Christian way to tell the way, you see.

01:00:53.868 --> 01:00:57.268
What God has got to do with this?Just tell me.

01:00:57.268 --> 01:00:59.188
They have mixed up God with all these things,

01:00:59.388 --> 01:01:01.948
it's such a big mixture they have made,

01:01:01.948 --> 01:01:07.356
that the fanaticism of Christianity is very much in delusion.

01:01:09.268 --> 01:01:16.047
For them, begging in the name of God is also Christian.

01:01:16.988 --> 01:01:19.114
It's a very dangerous game,

01:01:19.114 --> 01:01:22.308
because they are the cleverest of all, they think.

01:01:22.308 --> 01:01:25.868
So, the way they have entangled themselves into,

01:01:26.348 --> 01:01:30.988
it's so much dogmatic and so beautifully philosophised.

01:01:31.348 --> 01:01:33.348
It's a philosophy.

01:01:33.348 --> 01:01:36.028
To know it, you have to get out of it.

01:01:36.028 --> 01:01:41.199
It is so beautiful, you can't imagine. It's so beautiful.

01:01:41.988 --> 01:01:47.346
And so appealing, they are the most kindest people,

01:01:47.346 --> 01:01:52.216
compassion personified, great people, Christians.

01:01:52.216 --> 01:01:56.091
And the Christains believe it. Christ never asked you to beg.

01:01:56.953 --> 01:02:00.148
He never asked you to collect money for the poor.

01:02:00.348 --> 01:02:04.634
Nothing of the kind. It was not his idea at all, you see.

01:02:04.988 --> 01:02:07.148
He wanted you to get your Realization.

01:02:07.348 --> 01:02:09.935
That's what he wanted.

01:02:10.268 --> 01:02:13.148
You have created the poor.

01:02:13.148 --> 01:02:17.108
And you'd better look after them. That's not God's job.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:19.988
Communists may be the greatest Christians, like that,

01:02:20.268 --> 01:02:22.988
the way they look after their poor.

01:02:23.348 --> 01:02:28.279
God's job is one: is to give you Realization. Not other one.

01:02:29.828 --> 01:02:35.986
To take you away from this ignorance and mire of life,

01:02:37.348 --> 01:02:41.398
into that beautiful, blissful, kingdom of God.

01:02:41.398 --> 01:02:45.000
That is the work of God.

01:02:45.148 --> 01:02:47.868
And not these things which you describe back.

01:02:48.068 --> 01:02:53.021
But it looks so idealistic, you know,
the whole thing is such an idealism.

01:02:53.828 --> 01:02:55.988
That's why it's very, very dangerous.

01:02:56.188 --> 01:03:00.000
And it's so well organized.

01:03:01.868 --> 01:03:06.108
So well organized, you know, so well organized.

01:03:06.108 --> 01:03:10.508
Even the hymn numbers, everything is done so well,
every book done so well.

01:03:10.508 --> 01:03:15.000
Stand up to sing. Now you sit down.
So regimented, beautifully.

01:03:15.148 --> 01:03:17.753
No one can realize even that this is,

01:03:17.753 --> 01:03:20.348
we are going all to madness, you see.

01:03:20.348 --> 01:03:23.348
It's a very wonderful thing.

01:03:24.028 --> 01:03:26.228
You are not supposed to look this side or that side.

01:03:26.428 --> 01:03:29.308
It's all right. In England, I have Christians,

01:03:29.308 --> 01:03:31.428
many have been Christians, you see.

01:03:31.868 --> 01:03:34.234
I have Christians, Jews, all kinds of disciples.

01:03:34.234 --> 01:03:38.468
Indian Christians, I don't have even one. Except for,
of course, my family people are from there,

01:03:38.468 --> 01:03:40.428
but they've known my childhood, they know me.

01:03:40.868 --> 01:03:45.442
But the rest of them, for them I am a healer!

01:03:47.828 --> 01:03:51.829
I am, believe me!

01:03:54.148 --> 01:03:58.562
Hindus are my disciples, then Muslims are. But not Christians.

01:03:58.988 --> 01:04:03.724
Not one, I knew this.

01:04:05.348 --> 01:04:13.279
And when I went to America,
they pronounced, "A Christian mystic has come".

01:04:13.279 --> 01:04:17.469
That gave me good marks, you know.

01:04:18.868 --> 01:04:22.893
People came to see me because I was a Christian mystic,

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:29.403
properly baptized. I must get my certificate also.

01:04:32.348 --> 01:04:37.148
So our attitude should be of simply pity towards them.

01:04:37.148 --> 01:04:40.028
Like Blake has said, "The priest cursed,

01:04:40.948 --> 01:04:43.788
cursed my head when he baptized me."

01:04:43.988 --> 01:04:45.913
It's something like that, it is really.

01:04:45.913 --> 01:04:48.148
We should have really simple pity for all the people,

01:04:48.348 --> 01:04:52.148
who go to churches where there are all the graves.

01:04:52.348 --> 01:04:56.148
They sit on the graves, take all the spirits into themselves.

01:04:56.348 --> 01:04:58.994
God save them.

01:05:02.348 --> 01:05:09.818
I don't know why Christians, everyone is just like that.

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:15.988
But, among the Christians only, I am sure,

01:05:16.228 --> 01:05:20.995
one day Sahaja Yoga will come up very well.

01:05:22.028 --> 01:05:31.006
That's the power of Christ. I hope so.
I hope so.

01:05:33.988 --> 01:05:38.928
Mislaid, and misled people also,

01:05:39.188 --> 01:05:41.868
who are enjoying that misleading

01:05:41.868 --> 01:05:44.988
are most difficult, aren't they?
Don't you think so?

01:05:45.028 --> 01:05:48.108
How can you talk to them?

01:05:48.108 --> 01:05:51.348
Who can break it?

01:05:56.988 --> 01:05:59.948
When I go to India, I can speak,

01:06:00.268 --> 01:06:05.988
in a 'sanathana', means Catholic,
'sankar sanathana' means Catholic temple,

01:06:06.188 --> 01:06:09.148
where thousands of people came to attend my lecture

01:06:09.348 --> 01:06:12.148
and they respect me as a saint.

01:06:12.148 --> 01:06:15.428
Do you think in any church whatsoever,

01:06:15.988 --> 01:06:17.908
I would be respected like that,

01:06:17.908 --> 01:06:21.148
except for one "Unity Church" we had,

01:06:21.148 --> 01:06:23.268
where all kinds of bhoots are respected.

01:06:23.268 --> 01:06:26.828
So, I was also called to give a lecture.

01:06:27.348 --> 01:06:33.228
It was I think more of a - I don't know,
money-making proposition whatever it was.

01:06:33.228 --> 01:06:35.955
Whatever it was.

01:06:37.108 --> 01:06:41.028
But in India, that's the blessing

01:06:41.268 --> 01:06:43.308
of the Hindus that they are not organized.

01:06:43.508 --> 01:06:46.868
For them, a saint is a saint.

01:06:47.868 --> 01:06:56.178
Even the Prime minister, even, I would say, the president

01:06:56.178 --> 01:07:01.323
of India would stand for a saint. They wouldn't sit.

01:07:03.148 --> 01:07:05.894
These ideas are not here.

01:07:06.148 --> 01:07:11.448
We're too organized to get out of this organized way,

01:07:11.448 --> 01:07:15.520
to find out what is beyond. You see, we just -

01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.107
all our spirituality is satisfied by going to Sunday church,

01:07:19.107 --> 01:07:22.397
finished! Or to give some money for the feat. That's all.

01:07:22.397 --> 01:07:23.948
That's not the way it is.

01:07:24.148 --> 01:07:26.228
It's much, much, much more.

01:07:27.348 --> 01:07:30.188
But be kind to them.

01:07:30.948 --> 01:07:35.348
Christ has said, "You'll be calling me, 'Christ, Christ'.
I won't recognize you"

01:07:35.348 --> 01:07:42.346
That's what they are. I'm sorry for them, really sorry.

01:07:46.348 --> 01:07:48.472
Any other question?

01:07:49.988 --> 01:07:52.988
Mother, can everybody become aware at the most

01:07:52.988 --> 01:07:54.988
how do you recognize them up?

01:07:55.188 --> 01:07:58.028
Yes, everybody can.

01:07:58.268 --> 01:08:01.108
But everybody doesn't mind, want it.

01:08:01.348 --> 01:08:05.953
You see, they don't want it. See how many people are here.

01:08:07.228 --> 01:08:09.948
But if it was some sort of a falsehood,

01:08:09.948 --> 01:08:12.148
if I'd come with two horns,

01:08:12.148 --> 01:08:15.800
there could have been three halls big like this.

01:08:16.868 --> 01:08:20.068
People don't want reality, my child, they don't want it.

01:08:20.348 --> 01:08:22.348
They never wanted it.

01:08:22.988 --> 01:08:24.988
They always crucified it.

01:08:26.348 --> 01:08:29.148
But now, at least, there are some who really want it.

01:08:29.348 --> 01:08:32.108
And I am happy you think of others also,

01:08:32.108 --> 01:08:34.498
very happy to know that.

01:08:35.772 --> 01:08:39.652
But it’s a difficult task.

01:08:40.308 --> 01:08:43.740
I have to work very hard.

01:08:44.988 --> 01:08:47.948
They don't want reality
because in Sahaja Yoga it is a becoming,

01:08:48.148 --> 01:08:50.228
It is not just to come and fill in a form,

01:08:50.428 --> 01:08:55.038
"All right, you are the member", or you pay supposing a one-pound, a membership fees.

01:08:55.038 --> 01:08:58.908
It's not that! It's your becoming, what you become!

01:08:58.908 --> 01:09:03.268
It's your thing, that must happen. You must get your properties.

01:09:03.268 --> 01:09:06.562
This is the problem.

01:09:09.868 --> 01:09:12.936
You have to give up a little bit.

01:09:12.936 --> 01:09:16.043
It's easy to give up.

01:09:17.228 --> 01:09:19.988
It's very easy but I never talk about it before Realization,

01:09:20.188 --> 01:09:22.148
because after Realization, you just give up.

01:09:22.348 --> 01:09:23.908
If I tell you, half of you might go away,

01:09:23.908 --> 01:09:26.218
so I'm not going to tell you.

01:09:26.218 --> 01:09:29.095
You'd better get your Realization. It will work it out.

01:09:29.095 --> 01:09:32.348
It will establish a new priority within yourself, naturally.

01:09:32.348 --> 01:09:35.357
Because if you have light you see.

01:09:35.988 --> 01:09:38.348
You see snake as snake and rope as rope.

01:09:39.148 --> 01:09:43.449
So, I don't have to tell you,
you just see it, you just feel it, it happens to you.

01:09:44.108 --> 01:09:46.148
Yes, I know, I know. I wish I could.

01:09:46.348 --> 01:09:49.783
It can be done to all the new people,

01:09:49.783 --> 01:09:52.338
whatever race you may belong; it can.

01:09:52.338 --> 01:09:55.164
But how many are there?

01:09:56.348 --> 01:09:58.148
It's a very slow movement.

01:09:58.348 --> 01:10:02.498
For four years, I had only seven Britons with me.

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:08.309
I was struggling with them. Four years, can you imagine? In England.

01:10:12.148 --> 01:10:14.251
It's tremendous task.

01:10:15.348 --> 01:10:17.948
All right. So, you get your Realization now.

01:10:17.948 --> 01:10:20.357
Let's see how many you bring in.

01:10:22.188 --> 01:10:23.268
Yes?

01:10:24.268 --> 01:10:29.396
Divine Holy Mother, after Self-realization,

01:10:29.396 --> 01:10:32.794
how long it takes for a new [unclear]

01:10:32.794 --> 01:10:36.426
is it possible to stop reincarnating and seek perfection?

01:10:36.948 --> 01:10:41.108
Is it easy? Last, what did he say? What d'you say?

01:10:44.348 --> 01:10:47.388
Is it easy to? Last sentence, what do you say?

01:10:47.868 --> 01:10:51.148
I was saying after Realization, is it possible

01:10:51.348 --> 01:10:54.148
to stop reincarnating

01:10:54.348 --> 01:10:59.148
and to be perfect in these troubled times?

01:10:59.348 --> 01:11:03.753
You are reincarnated by Self-realization itself.

01:11:05.348 --> 01:11:07.868
And to stop having rebirth and birth?

01:11:08.068 --> 01:11:11.028
You don't think of these things afterwards.

01:11:11.028 --> 01:11:16.563
Because you are not futuristic anymore. You live in the present.

01:11:18.068 --> 01:11:20.108
You see these ideas of rebirth and

01:11:20.308 --> 01:11:22.948
this frightening stuff: you should not have rebirth.

01:11:23.188 --> 01:11:24.409
Why not?

01:11:25.988 --> 01:11:30.508
I mean, you create a beautiful house, everything,

01:11:30.988 --> 01:11:34.902
and then you say that you don't live in it?

01:11:35.348 --> 01:11:40.268
When you become a rich man, you want to enjoy your wealth isn't it?

01:11:40.268 --> 01:11:43.148
But they're not Buddha's saying:

01:11:43.348 --> 01:11:46.148
birth is suffering, death is suffering.

01:11:46.348 --> 01:11:49.868
Yes, that's true, but not Realization.

01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.428
You see, what he has said is:

01:11:58.988 --> 01:12:00.988
Buddha never asked you to

01:12:00.988 --> 01:12:05.425
to limit your desire of ascent.

01:12:05.425 --> 01:12:07.108
Because people talk of God, once

01:12:07.308 --> 01:12:10.468
they talked of it in India but nobody talked of the deities.

01:12:10.468 --> 01:12:13.988
That was a problem, because it became a talk again.

01:12:13.988 --> 01:12:18.908
Then they talked of a God which was abstract,

01:12:18.908 --> 01:12:22.545
like you can say, Jehova and other things,

01:12:22.874 --> 01:12:27.348
because they wanted people to get over their

01:12:27.348 --> 01:12:31.988
stuck-up points you see. Nothing worked you see.

01:12:31.988 --> 01:12:36.520
So Buddha said, "All right, let's talk only about
the Self-realization, nothing else. Not even of God.

01:12:36.572 --> 01:12:41.863
Let's talk of that.
Let people get to Self-realization, then we'll talk about God.

01:12:42.948 --> 01:12:47.055
So, he said, "All right. Only Self-realization. No God, nothing."

01:12:47.388 --> 01:12:51.654
That was his job. Fix you up with the idea of Self-realization.

01:12:51.988 --> 01:12:56.028
He said, "Dont' worship anything, don't worship, get your Self-realization.

01:12:56.028 --> 01:13:01.707
They are worshipping everything under the sun, these Buddists!

01:13:02.348 --> 01:13:05.191
What am I to do?

01:13:07.531 --> 01:13:13.615
So whatever Buddha has said,
everything is re-said in Sahaja Yoga.

01:13:16.268 --> 01:13:18.268
“Buddham sharanam gachami.”

01:13:19.308 --> 01:13:23.062
I surrender myself to the enlightened One.

01:13:23.348 --> 01:13:27.955
The One which is enlightened is your Spirit.

01:13:29.188 --> 01:13:31.308
“Sangham sharanam gachami,”

01:13:31.508 --> 01:13:34.392
I surrender myself to the collectivity.

01:13:34.392 --> 01:13:37.175
Unless and until you are a collectively conscious person,

01:13:37.175 --> 01:13:39.464
how can you surrender?

01:13:40.988 --> 01:13:45.000
Buddha also, whatever he said,
is not understood before Realization. You cannot.

01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.493
“Dharmam sharanam gachami,”

01:13:47.493 --> 01:13:49.517
is the sustanance within us.

01:13:49.517 --> 01:13:52.068
'Sharanam' means you become that.

01:13:52.068 --> 01:13:54.828
It's not a mental thing, "Oh, I surrender myself".

01:13:55.028 --> 01:13:57.836
But you just become.

01:14:00.068 --> 01:14:02.148
You become the enlightened one.

01:14:02.348 --> 01:14:05.038
You become the collectively conscious.

01:14:05.038 --> 01:14:09.087
You become the dharma, the sustenance, the religion within us.

01:14:09.087 --> 01:14:11.087
You become!

01:14:11.348 --> 01:14:13.148
That's what he meant.

01:14:13.348 --> 01:14:17.557
But for them, 'Sharanam gachami' means take a wheel in the hand, go on

01:14:17.557 --> 01:14:20.228
"Buddham sharanam gachami".

01:14:20.228 --> 01:14:24.658
Now. What this wheel is going to do, I just don't understand, you know.

01:14:25.308 --> 01:14:27.828
They'll go on hours together, they'll go mad.

01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:31.188
They will end up into lunatic asylum, beieve me.

01:14:32.348 --> 01:14:35.868
Or like mad you have to say something, all the time praying.

01:14:35.868 --> 01:14:38.908
Is that the way you are becoming?

01:14:39.348 --> 01:14:43.498
They don't even know where is Buddha placed into yourself.

01:14:48.348 --> 01:14:51.749
But Sahaja Yogis know where he is placed

01:14:51.749 --> 01:14:53.619
and how to please him.

01:14:54.028 --> 01:15:00.872
Whatever he said is nothing but Sahaja Yoga, absolutely 100%

01:15:04.308 --> 01:15:09.863
Actually, Buddha was nobody else but an Incarnation,

01:15:09.863 --> 01:15:13.087
who reincarnated himself as Adi Shankaracharya.

01:15:13.087 --> 01:15:15.000
You can see it clearly in your being,

01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:16.828
it can be proved on Kundalini again!

01:15:16.828 --> 01:15:19.801
You see, how can I prove it?

01:15:23.348 --> 01:15:26.148
To understand them, first you get your Realization.

01:15:26.348 --> 01:15:30.594
Again, I am talking like Buddha only.

01:15:32.828 --> 01:15:37.617
He tried something
by which he thought people will take to Realization.

01:15:38.348 --> 01:15:40.813
But human beings as they are...

01:15:41.908 --> 01:15:44.108
He thought they are very much involved in materialism,

01:15:44.308 --> 01:15:47.348
take them out, try this, try that. Nothing works out.

01:15:47.908 --> 01:15:50.028
Nothing.

01:15:50.028 --> 01:15:55.106
Only thing that works out: the real happening, nothing else.

01:16:00.268 --> 01:16:03.003
Mother, you are [inaudible]?

01:16:03.348 --> 01:16:04.868
What's it?

01:16:06.348 --> 01:16:09.218
Say it loudly.

01:16:14.148 --> 01:16:17.103
All right?

01:16:19.348 --> 01:16:23.228
Is there somebody else saying something which I didn't hear?

01:16:23.428 --> 01:16:27.268
Today, the vibrations are so much that really, to be very franck,

01:16:28.308 --> 01:16:29.788
you can't imagine!

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.160
I don't know how I'm listening to you, what you are talking.

01:16:32.348 --> 01:16:34.948
It's really too much flowing out.

01:16:35.148 --> 01:16:37.228
