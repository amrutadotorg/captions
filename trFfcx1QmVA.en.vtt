00:00:27.174 --> 00:00:29.467
Please be seated.

00:00:40.236 --> 00:00:43.982
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:56.296
As I told you yesterday

00:00:56.771 --> 00:01:01.924
we cannot conceptualize truth.

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:06.633
We cannot change it, we cannot organize it.

00:01:08.905 --> 00:01:13.112
The idea of truth

00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:18.270
is an experience.

00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:22.144
It has to be your experience of truth.

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:26.183
It's not just a mental attitude about it.

00:01:26.951 --> 00:01:30.166
Because in the world if you see

00:01:30.616 --> 00:01:34.199
there are people who believe in this kind of philosophie,

00:01:34.422 --> 00:01:36.606
that kind of philosophie,

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:39.930
they believe in this religion, that religion,

00:01:40.156 --> 00:01:43.199
every type of things they believe

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.814
and they say very

00:01:46.964 --> 00:01:50.265
confidently, i BELIEVE in that.

00:01:52.482 --> 00:01:56.237
But whatever may be your believes,

00:01:56.887 --> 00:02:00.164
whatever may be your philosophie

00:02:00.405 --> 00:02:02.752
or your religion,

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:08.679
anyone can do any sin,

00:02:09.058 --> 00:02:14.613
can commit any kind of violence,

00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:17.172
can do harm to anyone.

00:02:17.343 --> 00:02:19.714
There's nothing binding.

00:02:22.483 --> 00:02:24.453
You can't say, because

00:02:24.684 --> 00:02:27.500
I am such and such, I can't do it.

00:02:28.012 --> 00:02:31.648
That means that believe is only skin-deep.

00:02:35.235 --> 00:02:37.473
And that is why

00:02:37.914 --> 00:02:43.803
we go on critizising others.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:49.521
Now for example if you want to know about

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.134
the Muslims, you talk to Jews.

00:02:53.865 --> 00:02:57.393
And if you want to know about the Jews you talk to Christians.

00:02:57.883 --> 00:03:01.887
If you want to know about the Christians,

00:03:02.927 --> 00:03:06.872
talk to Indians or Hindus.

00:03:07.351 --> 00:03:09.785
So there is no end to it.

00:03:10.864 --> 00:03:14.064
Everybody thinks that they are all chosen ones

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:18.191
and a ladder is made for them direct to the heaven.

00:03:20.594 --> 00:03:25.520
If you have to live with these kinds of concepts,

00:03:25.892 --> 00:03:28.411
Sahaja Yoga cannot help you.

00:03:29.362 --> 00:03:33.733
But if you realize that we have not yet experienced the Absolut,

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:38.213
we have to experience the Absolut that is

00:03:39.194 --> 00:03:43.798
everyone who experienced that should say the same thing.

00:03:46.391 --> 00:03:51.184
Yesterday I told you how the essence of religion is one,

00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:57.967
though at different times it had to be coverde with other thoughts,

00:03:58.263 --> 00:04:02.960
but the essence was the same, is to seek the Eternal,

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.084
and whatever is transitory

00:04:06.167 --> 00:04:10.403
is to be used in its ownl limitations and understanding.

00:04:16.057 --> 00:04:20.621
I would say all these great prophets and incarnations

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:29.064
all were born on the same tree of life

00:04:30.007 --> 00:04:31.976
which we plug then

00:04:33.117 --> 00:04:36.691
like flowers are plugged, we plug these flowers

00:04:39.176 --> 00:04:41.797
and now these dead flowers we say,

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:45.616
this is the flower, this is the flower, this is the flower.

00:04:50.164 --> 00:04:54.277
Now whatever you are seeing here

00:04:54.678 --> 00:04:57.845
is a system, a subtle system within you.

00:04:59.256 --> 00:05:02.127
In the gross you see outside,

00:05:02.844 --> 00:05:05.410
but supposing you have to treat some tree

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:08.234
for its deases or trouble,

00:05:09.766 --> 00:05:12.496
you cannot treat it through its leaves.

00:05:12.778 --> 00:05:16.078
You have to go to its roots.

00:05:17.032 --> 00:05:20.604
This is the knowledge of the roots.

00:05:21.044 --> 00:05:23.789
And if we do not go to our roots,

00:05:23.933 --> 00:05:28.667
our civilisation, our so called development

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:30.790
will collapse.

00:05:32.634 --> 00:05:35.380
The roots are in human beings

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:39.529
and all our problems are man-made.

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:44.738
So what we have to do is to understand our roots

00:05:45.308 --> 00:05:46.988
and also to find out

00:05:47.211 --> 00:05:51.349
what is wrong, where did we go wrong, what was the mistake.

00:05:51.977 --> 00:05:55.250
And then to be ready to rectify it.

00:05:57.113 --> 00:06:01.775
All this can work out very easily

00:06:02.013 --> 00:06:06.605
if we get enlightendment of the Spirit.

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:10.722
In the darkness, we cannot see

00:06:11.011 --> 00:06:15.740
nor do we want to believe that it is darkness.

00:06:15.924 --> 00:06:18.236
We all think that we are all enlightened people,

00:06:18.414 --> 00:06:21.540
we are all going to heaven straight forward march.

00:06:22.084 --> 00:06:24.775
That's not the case, I must say.

00:06:25.151 --> 00:06:27.646
We have to know our self,

00:06:27.673 --> 00:06:31.981
and that knowlede is not something artificial.

00:06:33.039 --> 00:06:37.892
Like in India we have a custom to say that you are born again.

00:06:38.563 --> 00:06:42.123
For that they have a ceremony, a Brahmin will come,

00:06:42.411 --> 00:06:46.802
take some money, put some thread round your neck

00:06:46.951 --> 00:06:49.072
and say, now you are born again.

00:06:49.428 --> 00:06:52.105
In the same way we go to the church

00:06:52.238 --> 00:06:56.249
and the priest puts some water on yor fontanel bone area

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:59.140
and says, now you are choosen Christians.

00:07:00.083 --> 00:07:03.532
In the same way they have in Islam and in every religion.

00:07:04.084 --> 00:07:06.643
But it's a happening,

00:07:06.794 --> 00:07:11.892
it's a living happening that has to take place within us.

00:07:12.293 --> 00:07:19.446
Without that we cannot become a twice-born.

00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:23.664
And becoming is very important.

00:07:24.125 --> 00:07:29.746
In that becoming, as Dr. David Spiro has already told you,

00:07:30.045 --> 00:07:33.213
we have this machinery within us.

00:07:33.845 --> 00:07:39.210
Now we have to keep our minds open to see if it is there or not

00:07:40.034 --> 00:07:45.458
instead of just mocking at you, making fun of it

00:07:45.672 --> 00:07:48.895
or showing disregard.

00:07:49.118 --> 00:07:53.813
Because this is for the benevolence of each and every individual.

00:07:54.256 --> 00:07:58.143
And when human beings get transformed

00:07:58.359 --> 00:08:00.800
the whole world will get transformed.

00:08:01.036 --> 00:08:03.065
All our probems will be solved

00:08:03.294 --> 00:08:07.998
as soon as we can transform human beings.

00:08:08.495 --> 00:08:14.572
It's sometimes very surprising how people are aggressive to Me also!

00:08:15.235 --> 00:08:18.616
I have not come here to ask any money

00:08:18.954 --> 00:08:21.513
or to do anything of that kind.

00:08:21.747 --> 00:08:26.157
I am here to just tell you what you have and what you can get

00:08:26.467 --> 00:08:31.498
out of your own property and your own self.

00:08:32.943 --> 00:08:38.768
Here now you see, I am talking about the experience.

00:08:40.179 --> 00:08:42.866
Now some people think the experience should be

00:08:43.034 --> 00:08:45.661
that you should see some light.

00:08:46.181 --> 00:08:50.814
If you see some light then you are not the light.

00:08:52.989 --> 00:08:54.848
Understand logically!

00:08:55.233 --> 00:08:58.307
You have to become the light.

00:08:59.751 --> 00:09:02.876
Then what do you do? You give the light.

00:09:03.907 --> 00:09:06.645
That means you should be empowered

00:09:06.977 --> 00:09:09.442
that you can give light to others.

00:09:10.577 --> 00:09:13.651
That's the minimum that should be with a person

00:09:13.810 --> 00:09:16.145
who says he is twice born.

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.399
Also some people in India and also abroad I have seen

00:09:22.602 --> 00:09:26.269
are practicing horible practices

00:09:26.415 --> 00:09:31.589
by which they can just put some sort of an entity in you.

00:09:31.689 --> 00:09:33.542
They do it, I've seen.

00:09:33.681 --> 00:09:37.090
They charge money, you pay money for an entity.

00:09:39.281 --> 00:09:42.020
And when you get this entity within you

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:45.816
then you become like a mad person.

00:09:47.381 --> 00:09:49.181
You become very funny.

00:09:49.308 --> 00:09:51.379
Like one gentleman came to Me, he was talking to Me

00:09:51.545 --> 00:09:53.446
and suddenly he went up like that. (Shri Mataji lifts the arm.)

00:09:53.605 --> 00:09:54.886
I said, what is this?

00:09:55.056 --> 00:09:58.760
He said, my guru has given me. He couldn't relax from that.

00:09:58.934 --> 00:10:00.616
For about five minutes he was like that.

00:10:00.811 --> 00:10:02.148
I said, what is this?

00:10:02.367 --> 00:10:05.021
This is my guru has given me.

00:10:06.109 --> 00:10:08.266
I have lost my job,

00:10:08.777 --> 00:10:10.677
I have lost money

00:10:11.312 --> 00:10:13.141
I am a destitute now

00:10:13.237 --> 00:10:15.197
because suddenly I go up like that

00:10:15.423 --> 00:10:19.177
or suddenly I go into some sort of a funny gesture.

00:10:21.186 --> 00:10:24.606
This cannot be realization, can it be?

00:10:27.407 --> 00:10:30.492
Then there is another one who came

00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:33.113
and who - in India only this happened -

00:10:33.344 --> 00:10:35.843
he put his feet towards Me like this.

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.947
So somebody said, you cann't put feet towards someone,

00:10:39.128 --> 00:10:40.965
is not respectful.

00:10:41.112 --> 00:10:44.313
He said, if I don't sit that way,

00:10:44.567 --> 00:10:47.333
if I really fold my legs

00:10:47.536 --> 00:10:50.535
then I start jumping like a frog.

00:10:51.797 --> 00:10:53.583
He said, my guru has said so.

00:10:53.785 --> 00:10:55.290
And actually you won't believe,

00:10:55.419 --> 00:10:57.883
he showed Me a book his guru has written:

00:10:58.115 --> 00:10:59.662
You jump like a frog.

00:10:59.782 --> 00:11:01.665
And his disciple came here

00:11:01.820 --> 00:11:05.561
and made such a lot of money out of Americans, very nicely!

00:11:06.831 --> 00:11:10.212
He must have made them jump like a horse, alright, don't know what!

00:11:12.469 --> 00:11:16.101
Now you are not going to become frogs or worms.

00:11:16.803 --> 00:11:19.291
What are we going to become?

00:11:21.244 --> 00:11:24.601
We are going to become

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:30.689
super- human beings who have got collective consciousness

00:11:32.336 --> 00:11:33.603
in their awareness.

00:11:33.813 --> 00:11:35.415
Now as we are sitting

00:11:35.758 --> 00:11:39.212
we do not know what's wrong with yourself inside.

00:11:39.541 --> 00:11:42.108
'Till you become mad and go to lunatic asylum

00:11:42.247 --> 00:11:43.562
you don't know you are mad.

00:11:43.662 --> 00:11:46.615
And then of course, you don't know in any case.

00:11:47.702 --> 00:11:49.347
Now, if you.....

00:11:51.482 --> 00:11:57.635
if you say, go to any hospital, something,

00:11:58.425 --> 00:12:00.238
and if they don't tell you that

00:12:00.408 --> 00:12:04.333
you have got some disease, you would not know.

00:12:07.068 --> 00:12:10.260
There is no way of finding out - on physical level,

00:12:10.654 --> 00:12:12.138
on mental level,

00:12:12.384 --> 00:12:14.927
even on spiritual level you cannot find out

00:12:15.137 --> 00:12:17.684
wether it is correct or not.

00:12:17.966 --> 00:12:19.273
Now somebody says that

00:12:19.452 --> 00:12:24.370
I'll make you jump like a frog,

00:12:24.797 --> 00:12:28.475
or better would be that you can fly in the air.

00:12:29.065 --> 00:12:30.552
Why do you want to fly in the air?

00:12:30.747 --> 00:12:33.370
Already there are so many things flying in the air.

00:12:34.503 --> 00:12:36.827
Are we going to become birds now?

00:12:37.874 --> 00:12:41.845
So - and all of them are in America, I don't know why,

00:12:42.096 --> 00:12:46.964
what they thought of you that they jump on Americans.

00:12:47.594 --> 00:12:50.630
And they have come here, they have made

00:12:50.947 --> 00:12:53.116
kharabs of rupees. I don't know what kharabs is,

00:12:53.213 --> 00:12:54.913
they said ten millions.

00:12:55.986 --> 00:12:59.280
Rupees and diamonds and this, that,

00:13:00.596 --> 00:13:04.256
here I have to spent My own money to travel.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.100
So, it is beyond

00:13:11.763 --> 00:13:15.413
My understanding that how could they believe,

00:13:15.765 --> 00:13:17.844
how could these people believe

00:13:18.115 --> 00:13:21.133
such horrible things that they did.

00:13:24.522 --> 00:13:28.169
Sensible thing would be to understand

00:13:28.627 --> 00:13:32.383
that if you have a guru or if you have a master

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:35.668
then at least you should be a peaceful person.

00:13:36.017 --> 00:13:38.408
But they have become recluses,

00:13:38.900 --> 00:13:42.299
they have lost their jobs, they are dying.

00:13:42.588 --> 00:13:44.120
How can that be?

00:13:44.355 --> 00:13:47.560
And they say, now we are on the way of nirvana.

00:13:50.076 --> 00:13:53.302
Did Buddha die that way?

00:13:53.842 --> 00:13:56.640
Absolutely absurd ideas.

00:13:56.906 --> 00:13:59.015
And I was discussing with David one day,

00:13:59.154 --> 00:14:01.037
he told Me, Mother, we have no backround,

00:14:01.413 --> 00:14:04.482
I said, you have got your brains1

00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:07.240
We have to become!

00:14:07.644 --> 00:14:10.791
And become collectively conscious

00:14:11.121 --> 00:14:13.220
is tould to you bei Jung!

00:14:13.559 --> 00:14:16.571
Jung has clearly talked about collective consciousness.

00:14:17.242 --> 00:14:20.861
He has talked that you have to become collectively conscious,

00:14:21.024 --> 00:14:24.388
means within you you can feel

00:14:24.519 --> 00:14:27.662
what is wrong with you and what is wrong with others.

00:14:28.111 --> 00:14:31.533
I'll say Sahaja Yoga is more than that, much more than that!

00:14:33.155 --> 00:14:36.497
Sahaja Yoga not only

00:14:37.019 --> 00:14:40.224
gives you the union with the Divine, with the all pervading power,

00:14:40.412 --> 00:14:42.736
which starts flowing through you

00:14:42.938 --> 00:14:45.748
by which you become sensitive

00:14:45.879 --> 00:14:49.284
and you can feel the different centers of another person,

00:14:49.868 --> 00:14:52.532
you can feel your own centers,

00:14:52.854 --> 00:14:55.329
also you know how to correct them.

00:14:55.937 --> 00:14:58.904
And that's how you understand

00:14:59.154 --> 00:15:02.206
how to first have a proper body,

00:15:02.393 --> 00:15:05.605
a proper mind and a proper spirituall growth.

00:15:05.973 --> 00:15:07.850
Then you become,

00:15:09.207 --> 00:15:12.236
then you become yourself a master.

00:15:13.443 --> 00:15:15.644
I would suggest like this,

00:15:15.910 --> 00:15:18.889
in a modern analogiy you can have

00:15:19.083 --> 00:15:24.612
that in a car we have an accelerator and a break.

00:15:25.426 --> 00:15:27.692
When we don't know how to drive

00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:31.366
we go on pusching the accelerator

00:15:31.513 --> 00:15:33.070
and end up somewhere.

00:15:33.957 --> 00:15:37.413
Then sometimes we just push the break

00:15:37.806 --> 00:15:40.119
and we never start driving.

00:15:40.333 --> 00:15:43.798
But gradually when we start balancing it, balancing,

00:15:44.568 --> 00:15:45.919
when we balance it

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:48.893
then we know how to drive, then we become driver.

00:15:49.558 --> 00:15:51.581
Then automatically we can drive

00:15:51.899 --> 00:15:55.145
but still the master is sitting behind.

00:15:55.936 --> 00:16:01.779
This master is watching you - that is the Spirit.

00:16:02.371 --> 00:16:05.035
But once you become the master

00:16:05.255 --> 00:16:07.652
then you are watching the driver,

00:16:07.899 --> 00:16:09.915
accelerator and the break.

00:16:10.260 --> 00:16:13.969
All these things together in complete balance.

00:16:16.585 --> 00:16:19.699
We have lost the balance in capacity.

00:16:20.164 --> 00:16:22.618
Now, if somebody wants to make now

00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.075
business out of lumber which is a big problem,

00:16:28.017 --> 00:16:31.726
you go on cutting all the beautiful cedar tress one after another

00:16:33.325 --> 00:16:35.391
to such an extent

00:16:35.918 --> 00:16:38.748
that it becomes a

00:16:40.914 --> 00:16:43.998
place without any rain,

00:16:45.261 --> 00:16:50.283
ultimately you find the whole place has turned into a desert.

00:16:50.914 --> 00:16:54.028
Now God Allmighty has not created this desert,

00:16:54.167 --> 00:16:56.763
we have created it.

00:16:57.378 --> 00:17:00.565
Then if we have to

00:17:00.722 --> 00:17:04.218
now go to the, say seashore for a bath.

00:17:04.721 --> 00:17:07.229
I don't know, some people have put in an idea

00:17:07.372 --> 00:17:11.055
that if you tan your skin

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:13.172
then it is very beautiful.

00:17:13.386 --> 00:17:17.164
I just don't understand, what is the concept of beauty?

00:17:17.811 --> 00:17:20.210
Because here they are racialist

00:17:20.468 --> 00:17:23.115
and they don't like people who are brown of black,

00:17:23.373 --> 00:17:26.638
and here they are sitting hours together tannig their body!

00:17:27.194 --> 00:17:29.762
What a contradicition it is!

00:17:30.619 --> 00:17:33.636
So, hours together they will do it

00:17:33.974 --> 00:17:37.464
and then you find they have got skin cancer.

00:17:38.465 --> 00:17:41.581
And then from skin cancer to (...)

00:17:42.029 --> 00:17:43.029
There is no balance.

00:17:43.391 --> 00:17:46.777
All right, for a while you do want to sit in the sun.

00:17:47.210 --> 00:17:50.813
But to get skin cancer

00:17:51.103 --> 00:17:55.766
sitting down in the sun - even a dog won't do that.

00:17:57.453 --> 00:18:00.453
I mean that much common sense we should have

00:18:00.616 --> 00:18:04.380
but we lack in it because we go to extremes.

00:18:05.591 --> 00:18:10.349
We have lost the sense of balance and moderation.

00:18:11.131 --> 00:18:13.758
But after coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:18:14.004 --> 00:18:18.831
the wisdom of descrition comes in you automatically.

00:18:19.594 --> 00:18:22.863
Because if you start doing anything more than what is wanted,

00:18:23.022 --> 00:18:27.396
immediately the vibriations that you feel in your hand disappear.

00:18:27.908 --> 00:18:28.908
So you run away.

00:18:29.763 --> 00:18:32.348
Because as long as you are feeling these vibrations

00:18:32.535 --> 00:18:33.535
you feel very joyous.

00:18:34.095 --> 00:18:36.599
As soon as you loose these vibrations

00:18:37.126 --> 00:18:39.004
you think, something has gone wrong.

00:18:40.125 --> 00:18:43.337
Like on  a ship, I don't know if you have moved, but on a ship

00:18:43.897 --> 00:18:47.493
all the officers are playing cards this, that, talking

00:18:47.838 --> 00:18:53.556
but one minute they hear that the engine has stopped,

00:18:53.893 --> 00:18:55.540
they all run.

00:18:57.223 --> 00:18:59.354
Imediately all of them will run to the engine room

00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:02.100
to see why the engine has stopped.

00:19:02.412 --> 00:19:04.067
In the same way

00:19:04.330 --> 00:19:08.229
after realization you are in such a balance

00:19:08.773 --> 00:19:12.587
that you know how far to go with anything,

00:19:12.984 --> 00:19:15.628
how far to move with anything.

00:19:17.929 --> 00:19:21.204
In a society where machinery has come

00:19:22.984 --> 00:19:27.265
it looks that people are very affluent

00:19:29.449 --> 00:19:32.406
and that they have everything.

00:19:33.703 --> 00:19:35.841
But the balance is lost.

00:19:36.019 --> 00:19:39.470
Machinery is for us,

00:19:39.601 --> 00:19:41.423
we are not for machineries.

00:19:41.941 --> 00:19:44.437
Then we become slaves of machinery.

00:19:44.616 --> 00:19:46.794
I've seen people

00:19:47.009 --> 00:19:51.930
have to use a calculator even to count two plus two!

00:19:52.994 --> 00:19:54.764
It has become so difficult.

00:19:55.163 --> 00:19:59.954
You don't use your brain even a little bit, it will rust.

00:20:00.311 --> 00:20:02.622
And one day- I don't know what will happen,

00:20:02.773 --> 00:20:07.033
I can't say the future of a person who doesn't use his brain at all!

00:20:09.018 --> 00:20:12.180
So like this the machinery has taken over.

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.923
We are producing so many things.

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:18.929
Even in affluent countries, I would say,

00:20:19.880 --> 00:20:22.328
what is the affluence now?

00:20:22.734 --> 00:20:26.358
Is of plastic.

00:20:27.768 --> 00:20:31.327
Is plastic affluence and paper.

00:20:32.759 --> 00:20:35.667
Take paper to plastic, plastic to paper.

00:20:37.968 --> 00:20:41.312
Of course the countries which are supposed to be poor

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.041
should have sufficient to eat.

00:20:44.689 --> 00:20:46.665
That's one thing.

00:20:46.777 --> 00:20:50.027
But they need not have so many plastics,

00:20:50.829 --> 00:20:53.287
they need not to have so much of nylon,

00:20:53.736 --> 00:20:56.456
and they need not have so many clothes.

00:20:58.590 --> 00:21:01.269
So many things are not needed in life,

00:21:01.488 --> 00:21:03.017
actually they are headaches.

00:21:03.077 --> 00:21:06.099
You have already created mountans and mountans of plastic

00:21:06.198 --> 00:21:08.255
and you don't know what to do with it.

00:21:09.676 --> 00:21:14.122
They have become like great headaches

00:21:15.402 --> 00:21:18.613
to all such nations who are using plastics.

00:21:19.058 --> 00:21:21.651
Now so tendency the action of call is there,

00:21:21.838 --> 00:21:23.667
we are taking to natural things,

00:21:23.769 --> 00:21:27.879
we like manmade things, handmade things, we want to do that.

00:21:28.582 --> 00:21:31.871
But supposing you get to your realization

00:21:33.101 --> 00:21:37.152
then you'll use few things, but genuine things,

00:21:38.022 --> 00:21:41.749
and if you have to have more

00:21:42.353 --> 00:21:45.754
then you would like to use them for giving others.

00:21:46.657 --> 00:21:50.327
Because I think matter has only one value,

00:21:50.874 --> 00:21:53.728
that you can express your love in it.

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:58.401
That's the way you can express your love by giving it to someone.

00:22:03.370 --> 00:22:06.822
Apart from this economic so-called growth

00:22:06.946 --> 00:22:11.026
which is now standing on our heads, where we are lost

00:22:11.795 --> 00:22:14.958
we have so many other problems which are facing us

00:22:15.226 --> 00:22:17.968
because we have no balance.

00:22:19.355 --> 00:22:22.132
In our social life also.

00:22:22.605 --> 00:22:27.081
I know of a lady who is older than Me in age

00:22:27.876 --> 00:22:30.952
and this is her ninth marriage!

00:22:31.967 --> 00:22:37.375
I must say this is remarkable to have nine marriages like them.

00:22:37.765 --> 00:22:41.336
I mean one marriage is sufficent to teach you everything.

00:22:44.448 --> 00:22:49.091
What is she going to learn out of nine marriages? I don't know.

00:22:50.511 --> 00:22:53.091
And she is going strong, you know.

00:22:54.067 --> 00:22:56.721
And she is very proud of it.

00:22:59.276 --> 00:23:02.550
She has no joy, she has no love,

00:23:03.206 --> 00:23:06.556
she has no subtlety about her,

00:23:08.906 --> 00:23:12.435
and I feel without any children,

00:23:12.606 --> 00:23:15.600
without any envolvement with anyone.

00:23:16.341 --> 00:23:19.187
She is  leading a live worse than that of a dog,

00:23:19.952 --> 00:23:21.908
worse than that of an animal.

00:23:22.324 --> 00:23:24.827
Because animals at least - for the time being -

00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.580
are attached to something.

00:23:26.740 --> 00:23:31.657
They look after their children, they look after their own society.

00:23:34.175 --> 00:23:37.830
Like this we are doing in every aspect of our live

00:23:38.278 --> 00:23:40.567
we go to the extremes.

00:23:40.824 --> 00:23:44.448
And when we go to the extremes it repells upon us.

00:23:45.168 --> 00:23:48.631
Artificiallity has taken over us

00:23:48.888 --> 00:23:52.352
and then we suffer so much

00:23:52.602 --> 00:23:56.910
because it's only the reality which gives us joy.

00:23:57.964 --> 00:24:00.135
So now the

00:24:00.698 --> 00:24:03.440
best part of the modern times is this

00:24:03.637 --> 00:24:06.562
that there are many, many seekers of truth.

00:24:08.031 --> 00:24:10.058
It was said so.

00:24:10.609 --> 00:24:15.252
The one who is looking after or who is the Lord of these modern times

00:24:15.395 --> 00:24:18.540
is called as "Kali" in Sanskrit language.

00:24:18.851 --> 00:24:21.425
And this Kali has torchered one gentleman

00:24:21.615 --> 00:24:26.124
called Mr. Nala and his wife Domenty was separated.

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:30.653
And one day this Nala got hold of this Kali

00:24:30.788 --> 00:24:33.519
and he said, I'm going to kill you for ever

00:24:33.714 --> 00:24:37.054
so that you no more put people into illusions

00:24:37.257 --> 00:24:40.301
and you don't try to torcher their lifes.

00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.536
So Kali said, al right, you ca kill me

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:47.200
but let me tell you my importance, I too have some importance.

00:24:47.411 --> 00:24:49.003
He said, what is yourd importance?

00:24:49.090 --> 00:24:51.342
Of all the things you are such a destructive fellow!

00:24:51.802 --> 00:24:55.297
He said, I have an importance that when I will rule on this earth,

00:24:55.916 --> 00:24:59.973
all descritions are there, that people will eat food in the steel,

00:25:00.191 --> 00:25:02.553
and they will wear steel as ornaments,

00:25:02.666 --> 00:25:05.264
everything that we do nowadays is all described.

00:25:05.482 --> 00:25:09.953
But what is the importance of these modern times?

00:25:10.298 --> 00:25:14.206
That those people who are seeking the truth

00:25:15.003 --> 00:25:21.353
in the Himalayas or in the hills and dales

00:25:22.167 --> 00:25:25.673
will become householders.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.453
And they will find the truth when I will rule.

00:25:29.729 --> 00:25:36.215
So every dark cloud has a silver lining

00:25:36.531 --> 00:25:38.713
and specially these modern times

00:25:38.947 --> 00:25:41.602
have something very great about it,

00:25:41.985 --> 00:25:47.536
that people are taking to seeking and to reality.

00:25:48.266 --> 00:25:53.635
But as soon as people have come to know

00:25:53.845 --> 00:25:55.726
that there are seekers,

00:25:56.119 --> 00:26:00.475
what we find that there is a big exodus

00:26:00.661 --> 00:26:03.633
from the jail and from all criminality

00:26:03.779 --> 00:26:07.640
who are dressed up like great saints

00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.945
to cash the market of the seekers.

00:26:12.401 --> 00:26:15.015
So one has to be very careful

00:26:15.301 --> 00:26:21.961
that first you must see the deciples of those gurus.

00:26:22.249 --> 00:26:24.078
Then you must see

00:26:24.312 --> 00:26:28.113
if they take any money from you. Where is their attention?

00:26:28.551 --> 00:26:30.642
They have very good organisations,

00:26:30.766 --> 00:26:32.430
they can make a good publicity,

00:26:32.664 --> 00:26:36.972
they can do all kinds of tricks of the trade, but

00:26:39.318 --> 00:26:42.751
Self-realization cannot be traded.

00:26:43.064 --> 00:26:45.272
It's not a business.

00:26:46.432 --> 00:26:50.876
It is something innate and living process,

00:26:51.142 --> 00:26:53.146
just like a seed sprouts

00:26:53.727 --> 00:26:58.558
this happens to you and you  and you become a Self-realized soul.

00:26:59.431 --> 00:27:02.851
As a result of that, as I told you,

00:27:03.015 --> 00:27:06.130
your awareness becomes collectively conscious.

00:27:06.296 --> 00:27:08.642
You start feeling the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost

00:27:08.776 --> 00:27:10.276
coming out of your head

00:27:10.414 --> 00:27:12.086
and also you feel this

00:27:12.264 --> 00:27:15.903
all pervading Power as cool breeze in your hands.

00:27:18.727 --> 00:27:23.541
Then, when you start practising it a little bit,

00:27:24.949 --> 00:27:30.691
your connections become settled with this all pervading Power.

00:27:31.513 --> 00:27:36.385
Then such a person becomes very peaceful

00:27:37.298 --> 00:27:40.614
and very dynamic, extremely dynamic.

00:27:40.926 --> 00:27:44.374
Untiressly he can work.

00:27:45.060 --> 00:27:46.953
He is never frustrated.

00:27:47.219 --> 00:27:48.819
He is never angry.

00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:50.993
He is never upset.

00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.774
He becomes very peaceful

00:27:54.230 --> 00:27:57.225
and extremely compassionate.

00:27:57.869 --> 00:28:01.726
But the compassion is such that it acts.

00:28:02.702 --> 00:28:08.548
Even a glance of such a person acts, acts on the being.

00:28:08.887 --> 00:28:14.117
And it brings forth the benevolence of others.

00:28:14.558 --> 00:28:17.280
This is for the benevolence of others.

00:28:18.074 --> 00:28:22.029
Unless and until this happens

00:28:22.592 --> 00:28:26.467
you are not a sahaja yogi nor

00:28:28.619 --> 00:28:32.116
you are in the right place.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.172
Now in Sahaja - "saha" means with ,"ja" means born -

00:28:37.521 --> 00:28:41.492
born with you is the right to be one,

00:28:41.830 --> 00:28:46.305
united with this Divine Power, which is the yoga.

00:28:47.253 --> 00:28:49.393
This is the real yoga,

00:28:49.603 --> 00:28:54.128
all other yogas are subsidiary, they help you out here.

00:28:55.028 --> 00:29:00.553
And those people who do artificial yogas

00:29:00.827 --> 00:29:03.847
do not achieve anything.

00:29:04.245 --> 00:29:06.440
Once this happens,

00:29:06.807 --> 00:29:09.628
the transformation takes place.

00:29:10.270 --> 00:29:14.726
I've seen people becoming very beautiful

00:29:16.822 --> 00:29:20.111
and so great

00:29:20.985 --> 00:29:25.671
that one day will come this world has to change

00:29:27.161 --> 00:29:29.537
an we all will be filled

00:29:29.814 --> 00:29:32.485
with that feeling of collective consciousness

00:29:32.989 --> 00:29:39.155
where we'll all feel that we are belonging to one personality,

00:29:39.762 --> 00:29:42.756
part and parcel of one personality.

00:29:42.950 --> 00:29:46.827
The microcosmos a part of the macrocosmos.

00:29:47.138 --> 00:29:48.666
This has to happen.

00:29:48.924 --> 00:29:51.119
Many people are talking about it,

00:29:51.605 --> 00:29:53.659
hinting about it,

00:29:54.255 --> 00:29:57.935
as they say, the age of aquarias, that's a fact.

00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:02.300
Aquarias is the kumba, is the one with the pitcher

00:30:02.630 --> 00:30:06.531
which is where the Kundalini is placed.

00:30:06.905 --> 00:30:10.430
And that's why it's the age of the Aquarias.

00:30:10.644 --> 00:30:12.831
They talk about it.

00:30:13.134 --> 00:30:16.289
They get the glimpses but they are not there.

00:30:16.485 --> 00:30:18.123
We have to be there.

00:30:18.294 --> 00:30:21.587
For that we don't have to pay,

00:30:21.816 --> 00:30:24.016
but little time has to be given

00:30:24.526 --> 00:30:28.443
within a month I am sure you can become masters of that.

00:30:29.014 --> 00:30:31.643
And all your problems should be solved,

00:30:31.798 --> 00:30:33.857
your physical, mental, emotional.

00:30:36.026 --> 00:30:38.039
Sahaja Yoga does not claime anything,

00:30:38.247 --> 00:30:42.998
it does not say that it will cure your of this, no!

00:30:43.771 --> 00:30:48.520
But if your Kundalini rises and if you practise Sahaja Yoga

00:30:48.806 --> 00:30:51.246
then it does work that way.

00:30:51.785 --> 00:30:55.158
For example aids now, some people don't understand.

00:30:55.405 --> 00:30:56.820
I tried.

00:30:59.502 --> 00:31:05.087
One person in Australia was cured because doctor said, he is alright.

00:31:05.928 --> 00:31:09.487
But then he had such a weak will-power

00:31:09.786 --> 00:31:12.100
that he took to the same bad habits

00:31:12.315 --> 00:31:14.157
and his father was very angy.

00:31:14.432 --> 00:31:17.635
And he told me, let him die, Mother, forget it because

00:31:17.847 --> 00:31:22.817
it's a very difficult thing to cure Aids patient.

00:31:23.075 --> 00:31:24.826
And they have no will-power.

00:31:24.987 --> 00:31:28.163
So how can you say that you can cure Aids

00:31:28.414 --> 00:31:31.880
because it doesn't work out in mass way.

00:31:32.336 --> 00:31:35.677
You have to work individually on each an every person

00:31:36.062 --> 00:31:39.566
and that person has to be prepared to work it out.

00:31:40.713 --> 00:31:45.058
So that person I would say was the only one and then I gave up.

00:31:45.336 --> 00:31:47.737
I said, I just can't do that.

00:31:48.142 --> 00:31:50.097
They don't want to live.

00:31:50.271 --> 00:31:53.002
There are bend upon glorifying themselves with this disease,

00:31:53.153 --> 00:31:55.407
so what can we do about it?

00:31:56.384 --> 00:31:58.713
And that's how it all happened.

00:31:59.027 --> 00:32:01.136
It's another gentleman,

00:32:01.418 --> 00:32:04.938
who is not - I would say cured in the full way,

00:32:05.467 --> 00:32:09.044
he is doing Sahaja Yoga sometimes like that (not really doing it).

00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:11.582
But one thing is there, he still survived.

00:32:12.313 --> 00:32:15.436
It's now about three years back he came to Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:15.956 --> 00:32:20.010
In his blood there is still the virus

00:32:20.232 --> 00:32:21.684
but still he survived.

00:32:21.958 --> 00:32:26.219
But so many other diseases have been cured by Sahaja Yoga, no doubt.

00:32:26.497 --> 00:32:29.410
But it doesn't mean that we claime it.

00:32:29.719 --> 00:32:32.477
It means that, if your Kundalini rises,

00:32:32.686 --> 00:32:35.525
if She nourishes all these centers,

00:32:35.708 --> 00:32:39.363
then you get alright by yourself, by your own Kundalini.

00:32:39.645 --> 00:32:41.984
I don't do anything!

00:32:42.779 --> 00:32:46.440
And this is the mistake and misunderstanding people have.

00:32:47.327 --> 00:32:49.394
If one can understand that

00:32:49.914 --> 00:32:53.029
this Lady is here just for our benevolence

00:32:53.670 --> 00:32:56.150
not for anything else

00:32:56.632 --> 00:33:00.088
and our benevolence is the thing we want

00:33:00.536 --> 00:33:04.714
then why not have it, if it is free?

00:33:05.756 --> 00:33:13.747
It's a simple understanding and a simple love for yourself.

00:33:16.529 --> 00:33:20.001
This is what I have to say to you

00:33:20.392 --> 00:33:23.745
that please, take your realization!

00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:27.550
And we have a very good center here, luckily.

00:33:28.351 --> 00:33:32.217
In this center we have people who are experts.

00:33:32.696 --> 00:33:35.351
They will teach you how to become experts.

00:33:35.710 --> 00:33:37.627
And you can also do the same.

00:33:37.758 --> 00:33:39.897
Imagine if all of you get realization

00:33:40.004 --> 00:33:42.321
and if you become masters of Sahaja Yoga

00:33:42.621 --> 00:33:46.476
this San Diego will be absolutely a different place!

00:33:46.588 --> 00:33:52.122
As it is I was told that San Diago means, is the House of God!

00:33:53.104 --> 00:33:57.417
How can in the House of God you can have diseases?

00:34:00.658 --> 00:34:02.567
So I hope it will work out,

00:34:02.719 --> 00:34:05.874
and I hope all of you will take it up seriously

00:34:06.369 --> 00:34:11.786
and respect your Self-realization and work it out!

00:34:13.611 --> 00:34:15.697
I had asked you to give Me your questions

00:34:15.841 --> 00:34:18.062
but today there are no questions I think,

00:34:18.459 --> 00:34:25.155
so we go ahead with the programme of getting Self-realization.

00:34:26.175 --> 00:34:29.401
But on the very outset I have to tell you one thing,

00:34:29.552 --> 00:34:32.453
as I told yesterday again and again I have to repeat it,

00:34:33.151 --> 00:34:35.733
that please forget the past.

00:34:37.941 --> 00:34:40.857
We have to enter into the Kingdom of God.

00:34:41.269 --> 00:34:43.169
So just forget the past.

00:34:43.435 --> 00:34:48.114
Don't judge yourself and don't feel guilty.

00:34:51.381 --> 00:34:54.171
Just forget your guilt.

00:34:54.739 --> 00:34:59.477
Feeling guilty is a myth.

00:35:01.175 --> 00:35:02.992
Because you are not God!

00:35:03.230 --> 00:35:07.910
You are human beeing and if you make mistakes, what's wrong in it?

00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:13.784
It is not that wrong that you should all the time feel guilty.

00:35:14.332 --> 00:35:18.989
As a result of that by feeling guilty this center (left vishuddhi) cathces.

00:35:19.938 --> 00:35:22.571
Here on the left hand side.

00:35:23.684 --> 00:35:27.188
In the west it'S a fashion also, I think, to feel guilty.

00:35:27.581 --> 00:35:29.764
Since morning in English language

00:35:29.932 --> 00:35:32.728
they start saying, sorry, sorry, sorry.

00:35:33.018 --> 00:35:35.030
In our times when we were young

00:35:35.201 --> 00:35:37.166
we used to say, I beg your pardon.

00:35:37.275 --> 00:35:39.688
(...) now they say, sorry, sorry sorry, sorry.

00:35:40.335 --> 00:35:42.716
What is there to be sorry all the time?

00:35:44.499 --> 00:35:47.043
We have to be happy.

00:35:48.612 --> 00:35:50.853
But the amount of sorry we have

00:35:51.135 --> 00:35:53.711
that becomes a big blocked here.

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.946
As a result you get diseases like angina,

00:35:58.124 --> 00:36:00.668
you get diseases like spondelyities,

00:36:01.041 --> 00:36:05.592
many other dieseases come up, even paralysis and many other things.

00:36:05.937 --> 00:36:10.756
So first of all, please don't feel guilty!

00:36:11.478 --> 00:36:15.835
Secondly you have to forgive everyone.

00:36:16.297 --> 00:36:18.841
Yesterady I requested you again and again,

00:36:18.956 --> 00:36:21.999
please forgive everyone!

00:36:22.947 --> 00:36:24.745
Because it is a myth.

00:36:24.931 --> 00:36:28.239
Wether you forgive or you don't forgive, it's a myth.

00:36:29.640 --> 00:36:31.650
Absolutely, it's a myth.

00:36:31.987 --> 00:36:34.543
Because you don't do anything.

00:36:34.959 --> 00:36:38.105
"I cannot forgive, it's very difficult", means what?

00:36:38.577 --> 00:36:40.922
What are you doing about it?

00:36:41.674 --> 00:36:46.962
Only thing, by not forgiving you are playing into wrong hands.

00:36:47.661 --> 00:36:50.941
This an has harmed me, this lady has harmed me,

00:36:51.076 --> 00:36:55.107
this person has done this wrong to me - so what?

00:36:58.571 --> 00:37:00.619
By thinking about it

00:37:00.790 --> 00:37:03.667
we are troubling ourselves unnecessarily.

00:37:03.842 --> 00:37:07.247
On the contrary if we forgive them

00:37:07.872 --> 00:37:11.114
then the Divine looks after it.

00:37:12.858 --> 00:37:17.827
Let the Divine decide and judge

00:37:18.092 --> 00:37:20.597
you and others.

00:37:21.254 --> 00:37:23.751
On these two conditions I promise you

00:37:23.968 --> 00:37:27.029
all of you will geht your Realization.

00:37:27.479 --> 00:37:31.206
I hope, you all want your Realization

00:37:31.456 --> 00:37:34.511
And those who don't want I have to tell you, I cannot force on you.

00:37:34.767 --> 00:37:35.967
It cannot be done.

00:37:36.321 --> 00:37:38.885
You have to ask for it in your own freedom.

00:37:39.191 --> 00:37:40.789
I have to respect your freedom

00:37:40.928 --> 00:37:43.653
because this is a complete freedom later on.

00:37:43.892 --> 00:37:46.375
You become so free and powerful,

00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.510
that's how yru get rid of your habits of drugs and this and that.

00:37:50.792 --> 00:37:52.959
Your drug problem can be solved in no time,

00:37:53.116 --> 00:37:55.511
there's no need to use military.

00:37:55.931 --> 00:37:59.730
A Sahaja Yogi would never take a drug, whatever you may give.

00:38:00.135 --> 00:38:02.236
No question.

00:38:02.682 --> 00:38:05.577
We have a doctor, now he is not here,

00:38:05.946 --> 00:38:09.311
he was an alcoholic and a drug addict,

00:38:09.474 --> 00:38:12.340
he came to Sahaja Yoga, he got rid of it,

00:38:12.558 --> 00:38:16.568
and now he is in charge of seven hospitals

00:38:16.752 --> 00:38:20.066
in London, regarded as an expert in drug addiction.

00:38:21.412 --> 00:38:23.527
And he is curing people.

00:38:28.606 --> 00:38:30.372
That's what it is.

00:38:30.606 --> 00:38:32.475
If you become

00:38:32.916 --> 00:38:35.932
so joyous that you enjoy yourself,

00:38:36.115 --> 00:38:38.715
you will not take to anything like that.

00:38:41.417 --> 00:38:44.132
On the contrary you would like other to join you

00:38:44.239 --> 00:38:46.045
 in your joyous moods.

00:38:46.526 --> 00:38:49.125
And that's how Sahaja Yoga is going to spread

00:38:49.276 --> 00:38:51.624
very easily through you, people.

00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:54.613
And now don't doubt yourself.

00:38:55.187 --> 00:38:57.988
Will I get realization and this, that -

00:38:58.130 --> 00:39:00.261
that let your Kundalini decide

00:39:00.577 --> 00:39:04.137
because She is the pure desire in you.

00:39:04.781 --> 00:39:07.879
All other desires

00:39:08.158 --> 00:39:10.337
in general are not satiable.

00:39:11.023 --> 00:39:15.232
But this desire is the one which is complete satifaction.

00:39:16.820 --> 00:39:20.010
So let that Kundalini judge you.

00:39:20.263 --> 00:39:22.192
She knows everything about you.

00:39:23.427 --> 00:39:27.595
She has taperecorded you since ages.

00:39:28.071 --> 00:39:29.885
She is your mother

00:39:30.360 --> 00:39:33.751
and She wants to give you realization to give Her a chance.

00:39:34.191 --> 00:39:37.175
She has been waiting for this for so many days,

00:39:37.587 --> 00:39:38.587
so why not?

00:39:40.064 --> 00:39:42.911
And I don't do anything.

00:39:43.217 --> 00:39:50.039
If there is a candle which is enlightened,

00:39:50.131 --> 00:39:52.200
it can enlighten another candle

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:54.910
because that other candle has got a wig

00:39:55.128 --> 00:39:59.370
has got all that is necassary

00:39:59.486 --> 00:40:04.708
and you go near that and that gets kindled.

00:40:05.610 --> 00:40:10.340
Nothing is done special, no obligation,

00:40:13.033 --> 00:40:17.266
no fees, no standing on your heads.

00:40:17.691 --> 00:40:21.959
Nothing of the kind. You don't have to give up anything.

00:40:23.492 --> 00:40:27.210
You give up whatever is wrong when you get your light

00:40:27.381 --> 00:40:29.956
and you know for yourself what's wrong.

00:40:30.203 --> 00:40:33.846
You yourself want to give it up, I don't have to tell you,

00:40:34.157 --> 00:40:37.867
give up this, give up that, there's no need to tell you at all.

00:40:40.297 --> 00:40:43.782
So should we have Self-realization?

00:40:45.370 --> 00:40:46.955
All right?

00:40:48.757 --> 00:40:51.158
It looks very fantastic,

00:40:51.539 --> 00:40:54.974
you must be wondering how can that be so fantastic?

00:40:57.992 --> 00:41:00.885
Example is like this:

00:41:02.141 --> 00:41:04.994
In an Indian village if you take a television

00:41:05.705 --> 00:41:09.206
and tell them that in this box

00:41:09.535 --> 00:41:12.889
you can see pictures from all over the world,

00:41:13.604 --> 00:41:16.770
they will say, tell me another, this is not,

00:41:17.139 --> 00:41:19.619
I am not a fool to believe it!

00:41:19.992 --> 00:41:22.766
So you connect it to the mains.

00:41:23.052 --> 00:41:26.845
And you see the fantastic thing, that is does!

00:41:27.242 --> 00:41:29.760
You are not yet connected to the mains, that's all.

00:41:30.058 --> 00:41:32.054
Otherwise you are fantastic.

00:41:32.407 --> 00:41:34.707
You are just to be connected to the mains,

00:41:34.914 --> 00:41:36.826
that's what Sahaja Yoga does.

00:41:36.918 --> 00:41:39.106
And once you are connected to the mains

00:41:39.265 --> 00:41:44.696
and your connection is established

00:41:44.938 --> 00:41:48.831
then you will be amazed how fantastic you are

00:41:49.152 --> 00:41:52.731
and you feel that you are really the citizen of God's Kingdom,

00:41:52.938 --> 00:41:59.431
the way everything is looked after.

00:42:00.562 --> 00:42:04.395
How things work out, you start wondering,

00:42:04.839 --> 00:42:07.072
how this has worked out?

00:42:07.509 --> 00:42:09.977
Now in England

00:42:10.513 --> 00:42:12.880
we have so may people who are unemployed.

00:42:13.226 --> 00:42:15.635
But in Sahaja Yoga whosoever comes

00:42:15.766 --> 00:42:19.018
it's imposslible to get one person who is unemployed

00:42:19.379 --> 00:42:22.818
among Sahaja Yogis, wether they are educated or uneducated.

00:42:24.834 --> 00:42:27.154
It just works that way.

00:42:27.396 --> 00:42:29.428
It is that fantastic.

00:42:29.686 --> 00:42:34.492
No amount of telling about it will convince 'till you come.

00:42:34.615 --> 00:42:36.325
Like anybody would have told Me San Diego,

00:42:36.469 --> 00:42:38.198
who is a very beautiful city,

00:42:38.363 --> 00:42:40.497
I could never had understood it.

00:42:40.810 --> 00:42:43.996
Even seeing the picture I would have never felt

00:42:44.262 --> 00:42:45.718
the beauty of San Diego.

00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:48.963
But when I came here I could see how beautiful it is.

00:42:49.086 --> 00:42:52.444
In the same way let us experience our own beauty,

00:42:52.647 --> 00:42:56.207
our own glory that is within us.

00:43:05.588 --> 00:43:09.081
One simple thing one has to do is to take out the shoes for a while,

00:43:09.249 --> 00:43:11.968
just for a while. This will take about ten minutes at the most.

00:43:12.714 --> 00:43:14.313
In the ten minutes you are there!

00:43:14.548 --> 00:43:16.329
Very quick, isn't it?

00:43:18.746 --> 00:43:21.528
So be very pleasantly placed towards yourself,

00:43:21.849 --> 00:43:24.773
very pleasantly placed towards yourself.

00:43:55.256 --> 00:43:58.105
You have to sit comfortably, you have to be comfortable.

00:43:58.786 --> 00:44:01.616
And both the feet should be away from each other

00:44:01.806 --> 00:44:04.032
because as you know there is left side and right side,

00:44:04.124 --> 00:44:06.850
there are two energies within us.

00:44:13.549 --> 00:44:16.306
(...?)

00:44:16.767 --> 00:44:18.825
feeling the cold.

00:44:23.703 --> 00:44:27.648
Now, you have to place your left hand like this,

00:44:27.990 --> 00:44:31.196
first I'll show you what is to be done and he'll also show you.

00:44:31.461 --> 00:44:34.026
Please put you left hand towards Me like this.

00:44:34.291 --> 00:44:37.121
This expresses your desire

00:44:38.347 --> 00:44:42.245
to be Self-realized.

00:44:43.198 --> 00:44:46.052
So put your left hand like this. But be comfortable.

00:44:46.373 --> 00:44:48.694
There should be no pressures anywhere.

00:44:48.865 --> 00:44:51.392
Just put it very comfortably.

00:44:51.621 --> 00:44:55.243
And you have to use your right hand

00:44:55.541 --> 00:44:57.839
for releasing your centers.

00:44:57.965 --> 00:45:03.473
Though it is spontaneous, but by doing this is (...)

00:45:03.716 --> 00:45:09.111
and also you know what centers you have to work out later also.

00:45:09.793 --> 00:45:12.949
Because this connection has to be fixed properly,

00:45:13.067 --> 00:45:17.560
if it is a loose connection then you move up and down.

00:45:18.076 --> 00:45:22.771
So please put your left hand towards Me

00:45:22.938 --> 00:45:26.529
and right hand on your heart to begin with.

00:45:28.461 --> 00:45:33.349
In the heart resides the Spirit.

00:45:35.396 --> 00:45:37.948
In the heart resides the Spirit

00:45:38.166 --> 00:45:44.501
and the Kundalini is the Holy Ghost

00:45:44.736 --> 00:45:46.223
reflected.

00:45:46.777 --> 00:45:50.922
Spirit is the reflection of God Allmighty

00:45:51.323 --> 00:45:53.335
and His desire is the Holy Ghost,

00:45:53.466 --> 00:45:56.567
the power of Holy Ghost,

00:45:56.929 --> 00:46:00.131
the Primordial Mother, as we call it.

00:46:02.581 --> 00:46:05.640
And She is reflected within us

00:46:05.906 --> 00:46:09.469
on the Triangular Bone -called as Sacrum - as Kundalini.

00:46:14.044 --> 00:46:18.508
So please place your right hand on your heart.

00:46:22.322 --> 00:46:25.028
Then you have to place your right hand

00:46:25.295 --> 00:46:30.257
in the upper portion of the abdomen on the left hand side.

00:46:30.483 --> 00:46:33.154
We'll be working only on left hand side,

00:46:33.315 --> 00:46:36.962
left hand towards Me and right hand working on the left hand side.

00:46:37.322 --> 00:46:44.495
Now this center which is on the left hand side,

00:46:45.752 --> 00:46:49.032
in the upper part of your abdomen,

00:46:50.344 --> 00:46:55.954
is the center of your mastery which is created by prophets.

00:46:59.867 --> 00:47:04.766
Then you have to take your hand in the lower portion of your abdomen

00:47:08.179 --> 00:47:10.901
on the left hand side.

00:47:11.566 --> 00:47:14.483
This is the center

00:47:15.555 --> 00:47:18.028
of pure knowledge

00:47:18.525 --> 00:47:24.029
which manifests on your central nervous system.

00:47:26.897 --> 00:47:28.559
You need not close the eyes just now,

00:47:28.663 --> 00:47:31.865
first you see and then you have to close the eyes, I'll tell you.

00:47:32.510 --> 00:47:35.498
Now, you have to take it back again

00:47:36.649 --> 00:47:40.775
on the upper part of you abdomen on the lefthand side

00:47:42.102 --> 00:47:44.931
and then onto your heart,

00:47:48.410 --> 00:47:52.080
then onto

00:47:54.966 --> 00:47:58.954
the center which is between

00:48:00.328 --> 00:48:04.727
your neck and your shoulder, in the corner of that

00:48:06.640 --> 00:48:09.325
and turn your head to your right,

00:48:09.551 --> 00:48:12.926
so that you can push it even backwards.

00:48:16.818 --> 00:48:20.145
Then you have to take your hand

00:48:20.748 --> 00:48:24.257
onto your forhead across,

00:48:25.424 --> 00:48:28.574
you can take out your spectacles if you want to,

00:48:29.027 --> 00:48:32.329
and put it

00:48:35.295 --> 00:48:38.751
in such a manner that you can press it on both the sides

00:48:39.157 --> 00:48:41.846
as if when we have headache we press it,

00:48:42.139 --> 00:48:45.405
bend your head please.

00:48:45.674 --> 00:48:50.082
This is the center for forgiveness.

00:48:53.102 --> 00:48:57.092
Now you have to take your hand on the backside of your head

00:48:58.294 --> 00:49:01.718
and push your head on it.

00:49:02.675 --> 00:49:08.392
This is the center for asking forgiveness, but

00:49:08.809 --> 00:49:13.807
you don't have to feel guilty, don't have to count your mistakes.

00:49:14.435 --> 00:49:17.018
Now strech your hand

00:49:17.927 --> 00:49:20.638
and the center of your palm

00:49:20.988 --> 00:49:25.385
has to be exactly put on the bone

00:49:26.552 --> 00:49:30.404
which was a soft bone in your childhood,

00:49:30.889 --> 00:49:34.139
called as the fontanelle bone area.

00:49:34.599 --> 00:49:36.722
Press it hard

00:49:37.346 --> 00:49:41.635
and move it clockwise, slowly your sculp

00:49:42.023 --> 00:49:44.947
by pushing back your fingers,

00:49:45.273 --> 00:49:49.960
clockwise, very slowly, seven times.

00:50:03.516 --> 00:50:06.353
Now, that's all one has to do.

00:50:06.615 --> 00:50:09.238
Now, there's no mesmerism or anything in it,

00:50:09.435 --> 00:50:13.875
so you have to keep your eyes shut, don't keep your eyes open,

00:50:14.086 --> 00:50:16.900
'till I tell you, don't open your eyes.

00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:21.193
Because your attention has to be drawn inside.

00:50:21.468 --> 00:50:24.234
All of you should take your realization.

00:50:24.401 --> 00:50:27.699
Those there are - I'm told there are some people from newspaper,

00:50:28.021 --> 00:50:31.525
I'll be happy if they take their realization and then wright

00:50:31.878 --> 00:50:35.279
because from outside you cannot understand

00:50:35.482 --> 00:50:37.804
because this is a very subtle subject

00:50:38.139 --> 00:50:42.595
and for this subtle subject you have to have an experience.

00:50:43.338 --> 00:50:47.533
Without the experience if you wright, it will be of no use.

00:50:47.799 --> 00:50:52.160
May be it's misleading or will be useless.

00:50:52.296 --> 00:50:55.931
So best thing is to get your experience of Self-realization

00:50:56.178 --> 00:50:59.190
so that you can reach that subtle level

00:50:59.336 --> 00:51:02.880
and you can see things in that subtle light,

00:51:03.328 --> 00:51:07.141
enlightenment of you being.

00:51:10.179 --> 00:51:14.865
Now put your left hand towards Me, close your eyes,

00:51:15.338 --> 00:51:17.938
put both the feet apart from each other

00:51:18.319 --> 00:51:20.541
and be comfortably seated,

00:51:20.836 --> 00:51:22.554
neither in a fraught

00:51:22.748 --> 00:51:26.221
or in a very stretched manner,

00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:31.134
in a very simple, straight sitting posture.

00:51:31.555 --> 00:51:35.538
Please put the left hand towards Me and right hand on the heart

00:51:36.106 --> 00:51:37.106
here

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:42.404
you have to ask Me a very important question,

00:51:42.868 --> 00:51:45.309
it works like a computer,

00:51:45.507 --> 00:51:48.289
you can call Me Shri Mataji if possible,

00:51:48.761 --> 00:51:52.220
or call Me Mother, which is simpler.

00:51:52.799 --> 00:51:54.762
You can say, Mother,

00:51:55.623 --> 00:51:57.282
am I the Spirit?

00:51:57.579 --> 00:52:00.067
Ask this question three times.

00:52:00.445 --> 00:52:03.938
Mother, am I the Spirit?

00:52:05.013 --> 00:52:08.847
Ask this question three times.

00:52:24.190 --> 00:52:29.103
If you are the Spirit, you are your guide, you are your master.

00:52:29.571 --> 00:52:33.937
So now put your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen,

00:52:33.981 --> 00:52:36.672
on the lefthand side and press it hard.

00:52:36.868 --> 00:52:42.847
On ths center please ask another question three times,

00:52:43.297 --> 00:52:46.358
Mother, am I my own master?

00:52:46.482 --> 00:52:49.152
Ask this question three times.

00:52:49.331 --> 00:52:53.752
Mother, am I my own master? Ask this question.

00:52:56.275 --> 00:52:59.144
Ask it in your heart.

00:53:06.427 --> 00:53:11.356
Now take down your hand into the lower portion of your abdomen

00:53:11.571 --> 00:53:13.342
on the lefthand side.

00:53:13.790 --> 00:53:19.754
As I told you, this is the center of pure knowledge.

00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:23.911
I cannot force pure knowledge on you.

00:53:24.515 --> 00:53:26.504
It cannot be done.

00:53:26.746 --> 00:53:29.075
I have to respect your freedom.

00:53:29.365 --> 00:53:31.502
So you have to ask for it.

00:53:32.046 --> 00:53:34.383
So please say,

00:53:34.653 --> 00:53:38.608
Shri Mataji or Mother,

00:53:40.672 --> 00:53:44.755
please give me pure knowledge,

00:53:45.510 --> 00:53:49.943
or please may I have the pure knowledge?

00:53:52.189 --> 00:53:53.870
Say it six times

00:53:54.073 --> 00:54:01.211
because this center has got six petals, so please say it six times!

00:54:19.335 --> 00:54:23.961
As soon as you start asking for the pure knowledge

00:54:24.058 --> 00:54:26.937
the Kundalini starts moving,

00:54:28.285 --> 00:54:32.976
so lift your right hand on

00:54:37.639 --> 00:54:40.788
to the higher center

00:54:41.276 --> 00:54:44.526
to open it up, to help it to be opened out

00:54:44.704 --> 00:54:46.713
for the Kundalini to move.

00:54:46.905 --> 00:54:52.335
So raise your hand and put it on the lefthand side

00:54:54.775 --> 00:54:58.946
in the upper part of your abdomen and press it.

00:55:00.061 --> 00:55:04.246
This is the center of your mastery.

00:55:04.525 --> 00:55:06.649
So to open the center

00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:10.459
please say with full confidence without feeling guilty,

00:55:10.705 --> 00:55:12.701
without being defidend,

00:55:13.014 --> 00:55:17.500
please say ten times, Mother,

00:55:18.182 --> 00:55:22.180
I am my own master.

00:55:22.855 --> 00:55:28.106
Mother, I am my own master.

00:55:29.686 --> 00:55:33.399
Please say it with full confidence.

00:55:42.469 --> 00:55:43.469
Now,

00:55:46.233 --> 00:55:48.006
we have to know

00:55:48.586 --> 00:55:51.318
that we are not this body,

00:55:52.333 --> 00:55:55.027
we are not this mind,

00:55:55.372 --> 00:55:57.489
we are not this intellect,

00:55:57.779 --> 00:55:59.939
we are not our conditionings,

00:56:00.252 --> 00:56:04.036
and we are not this ego.

00:56:04.570 --> 00:56:06.963
We are the Spirit.

00:56:08.598 --> 00:56:14.171
So the most important truth about you is that you are the Spirit.

00:56:14.553 --> 00:56:19.038
So raise your right hand on your heart

00:56:20.171 --> 00:56:23.429
and please say twelve times

00:56:24.300 --> 00:56:26.868
with full confidence

00:56:27.474 --> 00:56:29.660
Mother,

00:56:30.065 --> 00:56:33.285
I am the Spirit.

00:56:40.201 --> 00:56:42.661
Twelve times please say,

00:56:42.840 --> 00:56:46.337
Mother, I am the Spirit.

00:56:50.175 --> 00:56:52.766
We have to know

00:56:53.030 --> 00:56:55.582
that the Divine

00:56:55.816 --> 00:56:58.783
is the ocean

00:56:59.192 --> 00:57:02.300
of love and compassion.

00:57:04.324 --> 00:57:08.403
It is the ocean of bliss and joy.

00:57:09.383 --> 00:57:14.329
But above all it is the ocean of forgiveness.

00:57:16.297 --> 00:57:19.701
So whatever mistakes you commit

00:57:20.183 --> 00:57:25.051
are dissolved into that ocean in no time.

00:57:26.701 --> 00:57:32.823
So raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

00:57:33.089 --> 00:57:37.731
and your shoulder and turn your head to your right.

00:57:39.288 --> 00:57:42.816
Here, with full confidence again,

00:57:43.528 --> 00:57:45.833
please say,

00:57:46.178 --> 00:57:50.786
Mother, I am not guilty at all!

00:57:51.477 --> 00:57:55.825
Sixteen times, please say sixteen times,

00:57:56.077 --> 00:57:58.454
turning the head to the right,

00:57:58.660 --> 00:58:02.204
Mother, I am not guilty at all!

00:58:02.359 --> 00:58:05.246
Please say sixteen times.

00:58:24.202 --> 00:58:28.701
I have already told you that

00:58:29.018 --> 00:58:33.118
wether we forgive or don't forgive,

00:58:33.369 --> 00:58:36.388
we do not do anything. It's a myth.

00:58:36.798 --> 00:58:39.746
But if we don't forgive

00:58:40.127 --> 00:58:45.485
then we play into wrong hands and suffer unnecessarily.

00:58:48.552 --> 00:58:50.913
So raise your right hand

00:58:51.211 --> 00:58:54.231
up to your forhead and put it across,

00:58:54.370 --> 00:58:55.618
put it across

00:58:55.916 --> 00:58:59.497
and press it on both the sides, both the sides,

00:58:59.771 --> 00:59:02.680
bend down your head please,

00:59:02.968 --> 00:59:05.790
press it hard on both the sides

00:59:06.381 --> 00:59:10.063
and say from your heart,

00:59:10.611 --> 00:59:14.100
not how many times but from your heart,

00:59:14.388 --> 00:59:17.868
Mother, I forgive everyone.

00:59:18.853 --> 00:59:22.195
I must say that this is the weakest point,

00:59:23.286 --> 00:59:26.615
but every time people did not get realization,

00:59:26.916 --> 00:59:31.805
I had to beg of them and spent so much time with them

00:59:32.130 --> 00:59:35.626
asking them to forgive, forgive, forgive, forgive.

00:59:35.993 --> 00:59:42.212
So can I request you now that please, forgive everyone!

00:59:43.291 --> 00:59:45.525
Only because of that

00:59:46.386 --> 00:59:49.352
don't miss your Self-realization!

00:59:49.495 --> 00:59:51.974
Just forgive ervery one.

00:59:52.794 --> 00:59:54.814
Forgive everyone.

00:59:55.143 --> 00:59:56.885
Forgive everyone.

00:59:59.734 --> 01:00:00.734
Now

01:00:01.446 --> 01:00:05.595
take your hand on the backside of your head

01:00:06.122 --> 01:00:10.237
and push back your head on it, allow it to rest.

01:00:12.684 --> 01:00:14.148
Here

01:00:16.664 --> 01:00:21.626
we have to ask for forgiveness from the Divine

01:00:21.999 --> 01:00:25.738
but we don't have to feel guilty, it is for our own satisfaction.

01:00:26.346 --> 01:00:29.326
We don't have to count our mistakes, nothing of the kind.

01:00:29.636 --> 01:00:34.957
Just to say, O Divine if I have done any mistakes,

01:00:35.342 --> 01:00:37.957
please forgive me. That's all.

01:00:43.594 --> 01:00:46.119
Now stretch your hand

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:52.564
and put the center of your palm on top of your head

01:00:53.333 --> 01:00:56.146
on the fontanelle bone area

01:00:58.093 --> 01:01:01.533
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:01:02.314 --> 01:01:04.068
Press it hard,

01:01:04.317 --> 01:01:06.290
push back your fingers

01:01:06.570 --> 01:01:09.459
and you have to move your sculp

01:01:09.844 --> 01:01:14.405
clockwise very slowly seven times.

01:01:15.134 --> 01:01:21.798
Here again I cannot cross over your freedom.

01:01:22.371 --> 01:01:26.486
You have to ask for your Self-realization.

01:01:26.764 --> 01:01:29.823
So please say seven times,

01:01:30.275 --> 01:01:34.702
Mother, please give me Self-realization.That's all.

01:01:35.004 --> 01:01:41.524
If you say it seven times and move your sculp very slowly clockwise,

01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:45.949
I'm sure, you will get your Self-realization.

01:01:48.386 --> 01:01:54.700
(Mother blowing into the micro)

01:01:55.192 --> 01:01:58.363
(Mother blowing into the micro)

01:01:58.645 --> 01:02:03.163
(Mother blowing into the micro)

01:02:04.138 --> 01:02:09.135
(Mother blowing into the micro)

01:02:10.321 --> 01:02:14.386
(Mother blowing into the micro)

01:02:14.668 --> 01:02:20.504
(Mother blowing into the micro)

01:02:21.932 --> 01:02:25.777
Now please take down your hands

01:02:27.519 --> 01:02:30.332
and slowly open your eyes.

01:02:31.101 --> 01:02:34.025
Raise your hands like this.

01:02:37.002 --> 01:02:39.615
And watch me without thinking.

01:02:40.166 --> 01:02:42.440
You can do it, you are relaxed now.

01:02:42.809 --> 01:02:45.694
Put the right hand towards me, little forward

01:02:46.123 --> 01:02:48.166
and push down your head,

01:02:48.717 --> 01:02:50.577
put down your head

01:02:50.937 --> 01:02:53.266
and see with your left hand

01:02:53.525 --> 01:02:59.763
if you feel any cool breeze coming out of your fontanelle bone,

01:03:00.674 --> 01:03:03.067
fontanelle bone area.

01:03:03.289 --> 01:03:06.261
But put the hand little away from your head

01:03:06.468 --> 01:03:11.336
and see for yourself, put your right hand towards me.

01:03:16.746 --> 01:03:21.264
Hm, now put the left hand towards me

01:03:21.574 --> 01:03:25.752
and see with the - bend down your head please -

01:03:25.993 --> 01:03:30.923
and see for yourself if you are getting any cool breeze

01:03:31.444 --> 01:03:33.923
from your fontanelle bone area.

01:03:34.086 --> 01:03:37.240
Some people get it much

01:03:38.093 --> 01:03:40.784
more so they - you can feel it little further.

01:03:41.542 --> 01:03:45.094
And some people get hot breeze coming out,

01:03:45.230 --> 01:03:49.564
doesn't matter, first the heat will go out, doesn't matter.

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:57.331
Now, please put the right hand towards Me

01:03:57.795 --> 01:04:03.644
and again once for all see on the left, from the left hand,

01:04:03.887 --> 01:04:08.281
just see if there is a cool breeze coming out of your forehead,

01:04:08.705 --> 01:04:12.503
from your fontanelle bone area.

01:04:13.101 --> 01:04:17.521
Just see for yourself, carefully, pay attention.

01:04:19.414 --> 01:04:20.414
Now,

01:04:21.592 --> 01:04:23.755
raise your both the hands

01:04:23.920 --> 01:04:27.734
and push back your head and ask a question,

01:04:27.938 --> 01:04:30.767
anyone of these three questions you can ask,

01:04:30.992 --> 01:04:34.226
Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?

01:04:35.412 --> 01:04:41.401
Mother, is this the allpervading power of God's love?

01:04:42.206 --> 01:04:44.622
Mother, is this the Brahmachaitanya?

01:04:44.712 --> 01:04:47.391
Ask anyone of these questions three times.

01:04:53.610 --> 01:04:55.312
May God bless you all!

01:04:55.690 --> 01:04:57.844
Put your hands down.

01:05:04.476 --> 01:05:08.068
See, there is no leave moving anywhere,

01:05:08.570 --> 01:05:11.558
so don't doubt that the breeze is from outside.

01:05:12.069 --> 01:05:15.066
There is no leave at all moving anywhere.

01:05:16.367 --> 01:05:20.466
So, those who have felt cool breeze

01:05:20.878 --> 01:05:25.005
on their fingertips or

01:05:25.357 --> 01:05:27.957
through their fontanelle bone area

01:05:28.207 --> 01:05:31.926
please raise your both the hands.

01:05:32.412 --> 01:05:34.955
Please raise both your hands.

01:05:37.221 --> 01:05:39.677
I'm feeling your breeze here!

01:05:40.473 --> 01:05:42.278
May God bless you!

01:05:43.962 --> 01:05:46.882
So many of you have got realization,

01:05:47.178 --> 01:05:49.563
so many of you have got realization.

01:05:49.958 --> 01:05:55.341
Now only problem is that you have to establish it perfectly

01:05:55.456 --> 01:05:59.005
and should know everything about it.

01:06:00.331 --> 01:06:06.506
For that they have got a very nice follow up programm

01:06:06.945 --> 01:06:12.085
and after that they have a course for eight days I think,

01:06:12.644 --> 01:06:17.124
where they will tell you all about it. Everything you can learn.

01:06:19.444 --> 01:06:23.282
You don't have to pay for anything, nothing at all.

01:06:23.878 --> 01:06:30.609
I'm sure it will work out and you will be rid of all

01:06:30.902 --> 01:06:35.476
physical, mentally, emtional problems and also spiritual problems

01:06:35.790 --> 01:06:42.312
and gradually you will start growing into spirituality

01:06:42.694 --> 01:06:45.340
and become great masters.

01:06:45.572 --> 01:06:47.051
May God bless you all.

01:06:47.437 --> 01:06:49.417
Now I'm going away tomorrow

01:06:49.672 --> 01:06:52.787
but I'll  be coming after one year again

01:06:53.141 --> 01:06:58.809
and I would like to see great trees of Sahaja Yoga

01:07:00.614 --> 01:07:06.671
giving protection to many people of San Diego.

01:07:06.943 --> 01:07:09.018
May God bless you all!

01:07:20.902 --> 01:07:25.203
If you want to meet Me, I'll be happy to meet you all.
