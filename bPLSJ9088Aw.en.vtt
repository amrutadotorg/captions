00:00:10.203 --> 00:00:18.614
But “diwali” word is from “deepa wali” means the “rows of lights”.

00:00:22.715 --> 00:00:30.444
It was celebrated firstly because

00:00:32.057 --> 00:00:40.305
thousands of
years back, Shri Rama was crowned on this day.

00:00:41.912 --> 00:00:53.768
That means the benevolence of human beings was crowned, was accepted.

00:00:56.401 --> 00:01:06.943
And in Shri Rama’s life, you see an ideal personality being shown to be a king,

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:13.120
to be the benevolent king as described by Socrates.

00:01:16.795 --> 00:01:25.245
So this was a great joyous thing that a benevolent king was crowned.

00:01:25.337 --> 00:01:33.977
That means we have to have a king who is benevolent.

00:01:34.057 --> 00:01:48.493
That’s only possible if the people who choose the king

00:01:50.780 --> 00:02:00.402
have no other consideration but that of benevolence of all the people.

00:02:03.274 --> 00:02:09.070
So one has to come to the conclusion

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:16.431
that they have to be Sahaja
Yogis, because others think that:

00:02:16.511 --> 00:02:20.893
“How much money we’ll get
out of this power that we’ll have."

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:25.690
Some think: “How much power-oriented we could be?”

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:31.061
Some think: “How many countries I can win?”

00:02:33.374 --> 00:02:36.315
or any other domination.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:43.691
So in the freedom loving people who are supposed to be free,

00:02:43.771 --> 00:02:48.096
the idea of benevolence is finished.

00:02:49.598 --> 00:02:54.155
Because whatever good for you, whatever is benevolent for you,

00:02:54.235 --> 00:02:58.815
can be only understood if you have wisdom, if you have depth.

00:02:58.896 --> 00:03:03.103
But if you have this kind of freedom
is to go amuck, do what you like:

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.386
“Because everybody’s doing it, I must do it.

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:12.387
Everybody is singing like this; so I must do it."

00:03:12.468 --> 00:03:15.975
But from where does this idea come in?

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:22.011
From where these ideas come in are the entrepreneurs

00:03:22.097 --> 00:03:26.345
who want to befool you, make slaves out of you,

00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:30.171
and this slavery is so-called freedom for you.

00:03:30.252 --> 00:03:35.423
But actually, I think it’s complete slavery because you do what they tell you,

00:03:35.557 --> 00:03:39.913
behave in the same manner as whatever they say.

00:03:40.136 --> 00:03:49.889
There are no fashions in that country, very few, very few women indulge into fashions.

00:03:50.266 --> 00:03:53.844
Nothing.
And men are also very simple.

00:03:53.924 --> 00:03:59.373
They have no fashionable things. They have only
things which are convenient, good for their climate.

00:03:59.453 --> 00:04:03.903
That’s what they wear, whether you laugh or don’t laugh.

00:04:03.983 --> 00:04:06.852
It’s everybody laughs here.

00:04:06.932 --> 00:04:12.333
If anybody laughs at them they’ll say: “This is
stupid, you see, I’ll have pity for him, that’s all."

00:04:14.652 --> 00:04:20.136
So one has to understand that it was the king, Rama, who was

00:04:20.216 --> 00:04:27.626
made the, actually accepted by the public, like a crown was
put on his head

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:32.622
to say that benevolence is the highest thing.

00:04:33.333 --> 00:04:37.724
And whatever is benevolent for us

00:04:37.804 --> 00:04:44.824
should be accepted in our freedom, if we are really a free country.
