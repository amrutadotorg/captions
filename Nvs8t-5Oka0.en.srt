1
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,880
Today I am going to talk to you about attention.

2
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:38,160
What is attention, what is the movement of attention

3
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:47,920
and what are the ways and methods of raising our attention.

4
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:51,760
Keep it in broad ways. Alright?

5
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:55,800
But when I am saying all these things

6
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:58,720
you must know that I am talking to you individually

7
00:00:58,840 --> 00:01:00,360
– it’s not about others.

8
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,680
Always the first thing human beings do is, when I am speaking to you,

9
00:01:05,800 --> 00:01:09,720
you try to find out about who Mataji is speaking!

10
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,119
This is the best way of putting your attention onto something else.

11
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:16,852
If you put your attention to yourself that,

12
00:01:16,973 --> 00:01:19,759
“This is for me and me and me alone,”

13
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:24,480
then it will have an effect, because these [words of mine] are mantras.

14
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,400
And that’s why it is wasted

15
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,400
because whatever is given to you is thrown onto another person.

16
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:42,640
So the attention, that you have, is the only way to know the reality.

17
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,200
Your own attention is important,

18
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,560
not the attention of others or your attention on others!

19
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,000
This must be clearly understood.

20
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:55,280
If you understand this point that the whole thing

21
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,160
is to be consumed by you,

22
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,320
through your attention to raise yourself to a higher situation,

23
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:05,000
it will work out. Otherwise, it is like giving food to you

24
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:07,280
and going to another person who is getting nourished,

25
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,800
while you are getting nothing.

26
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:13,360
And that person also may not be able get nourished,

27
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:17,600
because he doesn’t know that you are throwing it to that person.

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,200
So today, as I am going to speak to you about attention,

29
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:27,960
you should know that your attention should absorb all that I am saying.

30
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,440
It is not meant for anybody else.

31
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,480
You better sit in thoughtless awareness, that’s the best way,

32
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:39,000
so that it goes into you. Otherwise it’s like a lecture, you know.

33
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,400
That you listen to me has no effect.

34
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:48,160
Every lecture will transform you because, after all, I am speaking.

35
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:51,800
But because you always think of others

36
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,160
and you think of your problems all the time

37
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:58,280
– something nonsensical is going on, about which you are worried –

38
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,440
and the attention is so overloaded

39
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,040
that whatever is said to you doesn’t go into you.

40
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:08,120
So, just now, utilise it by being attentive and knowing

41
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:12,200
that all these nonsensical things have no value.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:17,280
It’s your attention that has to come up and has to grow.

43
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:36,680
So, attention is the whole of the canvas of your being

44
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,360
– is a complete canvas, is the attention.

45
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,880
Complete canvas of your being is the attention.

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,640
How much you have gone into it, how much you have discovered it,

47
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,640
how far you have raised it is a different point.

48
00:03:56,040 --> 00:04:02,880
Attention is Chitta and God is attention.

49
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:08,280
How far your attention has been enlightened is a different point.

50
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:13,280
But your attention is God

51
00:04:16,520 --> 00:04:21,960
– if you become enlightened to that extent.

52
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,560
It is like a canvas.

53
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:31,840
You can say it is like a canvas which is spread out for a film,

54
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,339
and whatever aptitudes

55
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:41,160
or, you can say, the drags or movements, your attention has,

56
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,320
shows on that canvas.

57
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,880
I don’t know what is the word for ‘vritti’ in English language.

58
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,520
It’s not aptitude, but a person gets prone to, or his attention is dragged to

59
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,160
– I don’t know [if] there is a word like that in English language – vritti.

60
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:05,000
Can you suggest any word?

61
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:15,760
So our attention is just a pure, completely pure canvas

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,120
and is acted upon by the three gunas we have, to begin with.

63
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,760
And the three gunas come to you, as you know,

64
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:33,400
one from your past, one from your future sense and one from the present.

65
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:44,440
Now, whatever have been your experiences about

66
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,600
a particular thing or a particular occasion,

67
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:56,720
so far, is completely recorded in your memory.

68
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,400
For example, if you see the black colour:

69
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:07,640
all that goes with the black colour is recorded in your memory.

70
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:14,680
As soon as you see this black colour, quite a lot of it comes up.

71
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:22,640
That means, as soon as you see this with your attention,

72
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:28,000
the attention gets muddled up, or you can say the attention gets coloured

73
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:32,760
with all the memories about this black colour.

74
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:37,778
And then your action takes place

75
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:43,149
according to the way your attention is affected.

76
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,480
For example, just now something was burned by these flames.

77
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:57,000
Now, all of you became aware of it.

78
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,800
Next time whenever you will see a flame,

79
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:05,440
first thing [that] will happen will be that you will be cautious about it.

80
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,480
It is not going to happen again,

81
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:10,560
but the whole memory will come to you

82
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:15,240
and you will try to be cautious or warn others,

83
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:21,080
because your attention will become aware of that

84
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:28,240
as soon as you will see that, because that canvas of your attention

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:34,640
itself will start throwing out these pictures, out of itself,

86
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:39,520
through your past experiences, on to the canvas.

87
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:44,560
This is a living canvas.

88
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:54,200
Or may be that if you have got some ideas which you have premeditated,

89
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:59,160
or thought of, of the future.

90
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:02,240
For example, you must have thought of somebody that,

91
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:05,840
“If I meet that man I will tell him like this.”

92
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,567
As soon as you will meet that man,

93
00:08:09,688 --> 00:08:14,320
your attention will start bubbling out with those ideas

94
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:16,518
that are coming about this man,

95
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,800
and you will start addressing to him accordingly.

96
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,840
It’s all stored up within you,

97
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,480
whether it is about the future or about the past.

98
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:32,320
It’s given out of the attention through that bubbling process

99
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:36,880
which depends on your dragging nature, where are you dragged.

100
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,160
That’s called as vritti, but I don’t know what you call it in English language.

101
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,440
I do not know what is the, what you are prone to (tendency).

102
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,960
Vritti is a very neutral word. It doesn’t mean anything bad.

103
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,280
It means where you are drawn to.

104
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,280
Vritti means a temperament by which you are drawn to.

105
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:59,520
And whatever is your temperament, it acts like that.

106
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:07,040
For example, if you see a man walking, say, blindly

107
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,680
– he cannot see things –

108
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,360
one person may get angry with that person,

109
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,160
another may have pity for that person,

110
00:09:16,280 --> 00:09:19,680
third may come forward to help him out.

111
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,640
It’s the vritti, it’s the temperament,

112
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,360
that you have developed through your three gunas.

113
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:37,600
That’s why this attention becomes identified with you.

114
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:46,000
And when you are identified with this, your vritti, your temperaments,

115
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,800
then you are still in a misidentified area.

116
00:09:53,920 --> 00:10:00,320
Let us take a case of somebody who has been possessed before.

117
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,840
Now, coming to Sahaja Yoga his possession goes away.

118
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:11,640
But the memory remains in the brain that he was possessed.

119
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:16,720
And [if] the memory is stronger in a person, left side is stronger,

120
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:20,480
then that memory lingers on,

121
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:24,880
and as soon as that person comes in contact with anyone

122
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:30,080
which has got something to do with the past possession, it clicks.

123
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,320
And the whole thing starts coming into you bubbling out

124
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:37,040
and you think you are again possessed.

125
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:43,040
It is the memory which gives you [this reaction]. It’s a myth.

126
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,600
It’s the memory that tells you, “Oh, you are again possessed!”

127
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,480
Because your left side is weak, means you always live in your memory.

128
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,960
Your memory is stronger than yourself.

129
00:10:57,080 --> 00:11:00,703
If you could make yourself stronger than your memory,

130
00:11:00,824 --> 00:11:02,951
nothing can possess you.

131
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,080
But after you get your Realisation,

132
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,120
you are not still identified with that state of mind

133
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:28,480
in which you see your ego and superego as myths.

134
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:36,120
Still you get caught up into your ego and superego,

135
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:42,120
and that’s why your attention is still in a mess.

136
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:49,440
In a pure simple way of attention in an innocent child,

137
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:54,840
he sees everything in pratyaksha,

138
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:59,120
means in actual experiencing of something – for a child –

139
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:01,240
because he has no memory.

140
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,680
So he’ll have to burn his hand to feel that this burns.

141
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:11,360
He has to touch something cold to know that it is cold.

142
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:13,680
His memory is not yet built up.

143
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:22,240
So into the actual experiencing of it he lives.

144
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:28,680
But that actual experiencing becomes memory.

145
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:31,200
And once the memory is built up stronger,

146
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:35,480
the whole personality is affected by memory.

147
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:40,000
All the conditioning of all kinds come through that;

148
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,880
your reading, even the whole atmosphere can come to you.

149
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,240
You see, sometimes you smell a particular soap,

150
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,880
or say a rose, you smell it –

151
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:57,680
then all the memories of smelling such a rose, sometimes,

152
00:12:57,800 --> 00:13:00,520
comes to you and you may feel really elated sometimes,

153
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,720
maybe sometimes, maybe, or sometimes very unhappy,

154
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:05,840
whatever may be the situation.

155
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:10,160
So you may feel happy or unhappy.

156
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:14,480
Because, whatever experiences you have had,

157
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,120
has given you a memory.

158
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:20,880
This memory might have given you a superego,

159
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,960
or might have given you a ego.

160
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:26,600
This scanning might have taken place.

161
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,440
If it has been a ego and a superego,

162
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:35,360
then may be that, if it was ego you must have felt happy.

163
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:40,280
If it is satisfying to your ego you feel very happy.

164
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:44,280
If it is not, if it is superego, if you are suppressed by this,

165
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,280
then you feel very unhappy.

166
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:49,120
So both things like happiness or unhappiness

167
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:54,600
are the states where you are still in the myth,

168
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,560
still the myth exists. You have to still go beyond.

169
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,520
So if you feel happy about some situation, you should know you

170
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:06,200
are only happy before Realisation,

171
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:12,400
because it is giving some support to your ego to bloat.

172
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,800
And if you are unhappy, then you should know that

173
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,400
there is some sort of a suppression on your ego

174
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:23,840
and there’s a superego developing.

175
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:30,880
So both the situations have been of no help to you,

176
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,400
of no help to you for your growth,

177
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:39,680
except that both these institutions develop so much

178
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:46,480
that you are away from the real experiencing.

179
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:51,360
The real experiencing stops

180
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:56,680
because your attention is so much muddled up.

181
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:02,680
So on one side if you move – on the left hand side –

182
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,560
your attention is muddled up with fear, with pain,

183
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:19,600
with unhappiness, with hopelessness, dejection.

184
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:27,440
The other side, if you indulge too much on to the right hand side

185
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:29,360
– little bit also –

186
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:37,440
you start getting elated, excited, over-dominating.

187
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:45,600
The colour of the left side is blue.

188
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:50,320
And the blue colour starts changing to the black.

189
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:57,760
While on the right hand side it is, to begin with, yellow,

190
00:15:57,880 --> 00:16:00,360
light yellow or you can say golden,

191
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:04,720
then yellow, then orange and then red.

192
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:08,480
So you go to aggression on the right hand side.

193
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:16,200
On the left hand side you go into a complete state of

194
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,600
entropy, you can call it,

195
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:22,640
or a state where you are separated from yourself

196
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:26,120
into a complete frozen state.

197
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,480
So [on] one side you become completely frozen,

198
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,240
on the other side you become completely heated up.

199
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:40,760
Both these things are, again, movement on the wrong direction.

200
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,320
Even in the centre when the attention is kept

201
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:49,560
– that you keep your attention more in the centre –

202
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:56,480
there also, because it’s a very sensitive point, it doesn’t stay there.

203
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,120
For example,

204
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:06,200
when we, say, use fire, we can use it for burning the house.

205
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,280
In the same way we can use it for creating smoke.

206
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:16,960
But we can also use this fire in its proper way, if we use it,

207
00:17:17,080 --> 00:17:22,640
in its proper proportion, for cooking the food [or] for giving us light.

208
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:28,880
If it is too much, it can burn like a big fire.

209
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,000
If it is too little, it can burn like smoke.

210
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:36,200
But in the center when you know how to balance it,

211
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,760
then you can use it for your own purpose

212
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:46,000
– for cooking or for giving light, and then for a puja too.

213
00:17:47,920 --> 00:17:57,200
So in the same way when we really balance our gunas properly,

214
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:03,200
then we become gradually the master of the whole situation.
