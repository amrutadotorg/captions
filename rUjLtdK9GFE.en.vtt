00:00:01.333 --> 00:00:06.507
Happy Christmas to you all.
May God Bless You.

00:00:28.273 --> 00:00:34.228
The birth of Christ is celebrated all over
the world,

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:42.934
and it’s nice that we are celebrating here
at Ganapatipule His birth.

00:00:43.135 --> 00:00:47.749
As you know very well in Sahaja Yoga,
we have realised

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.984
that the principle of Christ was
Shri Ganesha.

00:00:51.185 --> 00:00:54.943
So this is the right place to celebrate
the Christmas

00:00:55.144 --> 00:01:02.541
and the Birth of Christ is the - absolutely
coincides today

00:01:02.742 --> 00:01:07.985
and I am very happy that you have chosen
Ganapatipule for that.

00:01:08.186 --> 00:01:15.900
Now as you know very well, that Ganesha’s
principle became

00:01:16.101 --> 00:01:19.886
the principle of Christ at the Agnya
Chakra.

00:01:20.087 --> 00:01:26.032
And that’s a very important centre that
we have within ourselves

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:34.985
which has given us a new dimension
to our personality,

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:41.992
that we can resurrect ourselves as Christ
resurrected Himself;

00:01:42.193 --> 00:01:47.443
so the message of His life is resurrection.

00:01:47.644 --> 00:01:55.817
So from His birth He got His resurrection
done, in the same way

00:01:56.018 --> 00:02:04.120
you are born again when you get your
Resurrection, or you become Sahaja Yogis.

00:02:04.321 --> 00:02:08.567
On the same principle it works.

00:02:08.768 --> 00:02:16.063
But He had to physically pass through
all the penance,

00:02:16.264 --> 00:02:20.865
as we say that He died for us, for our
sins;

00:02:21.066 --> 00:02:28.244
but now as He has done that for us,
the Agnya Chakra is absolutely

00:02:28.445 --> 00:02:33.007
at our command, that we can open it out
whenever we like,

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:40.084
if we are Sahaja Yogis, and we can
enlighten that Chakra also.

00:02:40.962 --> 00:02:44.187
This is the Chakra always caught up
by people

00:02:44.388 --> 00:02:50.787
who try talk about Christ, to say things
about Christ,

00:02:50.988 --> 00:02:55.905
or to profess that they have Christ
in their pockets,

00:02:56.106 --> 00:02:58.963
when they have no connection with Christ.

00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:01.673
Now, for this Christ has very clearly said,

00:03:01.874 --> 00:03:06.090
that, “You will be calling me Christ,
Christ, and I won’t recognise you”.

00:03:06.291 --> 00:03:09.721
There are so many people of this kind,
and that’s why

00:03:09.922 --> 00:03:16.017
the celebration of Christ’s Birth by them
is just a festival

00:03:16.218 --> 00:03:19.803
but has no deeper significance.
But for Sahaja Yogis

00:03:20.004 --> 00:03:26.586
it’s a very great happening, because
His birth

00:03:26.787 --> 00:03:29.790
has brought such a great Incarnation
on this earth

00:03:29.991 --> 00:03:38.887
and by that we could achieve our
Realisation because He is at the gate.

00:03:39.228 --> 00:03:46.713
So, today is the day of thankfulness
for Christ’s Advent on this earth,

00:03:46.914 --> 00:03:53.159
and we have to see that as He is our
eldest brother,

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:59.592
we can say, He is our leader, we have
to follow His footsteps;

00:03:59.793 --> 00:04:05.395
in our Resurrection, we have to show
that we have imbibed

00:04:05.596 --> 00:04:11.472
the qualities which are Christ-like,

00:04:11.673 --> 00:04:18.873
illuminating the whole Universe with
our enlightened lives.

00:04:19.074 --> 00:04:23.477
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis
to understand that

00:04:23.678 --> 00:04:29.113
when we are celebrating today the birth
of Christ, we stand for something

00:04:29.314 --> 00:04:38.214
very much beautiful, pure and glorious.

00:04:38.401 --> 00:04:45.834
Christ’s life is a - symbolically can be
called

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:57.223
as the symbol of purity and holiness,
He was purity and holiness.

00:04:57.424 --> 00:05:04.127
When we talk of purity we may think
about outside purity,

00:05:04.328 --> 00:05:09.285
or maybe the purity of our writings
or talking,

00:05:09.486 --> 00:05:14.797
or maybe we are very sophisticated, or we
talk very sweetly, or we are very kind;

00:05:14.998 --> 00:05:26.587
but Christ was pure in the sense that
He was nothing but purity.

00:05:27.612 --> 00:05:33.503
And He went to this extent of purity,
that He said that,

00:05:33.704 --> 00:05:40.372
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,
that your eyes have to be pure.

00:05:40.573 --> 00:05:46.688
Even up to the eyes. He said: “Thou
shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:53.327
So, the lust and greed has to disappear
from our personality

00:05:53.528 --> 00:05:57.397
if we have to follow Christ, if we have
to understand

00:05:57.598 --> 00:06:00.957
what an incarnation of holiness He was.

00:06:01.158 --> 00:06:05.662
Holiness is very important today, when
in this ghor Kali Yuga

00:06:05.863 --> 00:06:10.134
you find all kinds of horrible things
happening.

00:06:10.335 --> 00:06:15.839
If you believe in holiness, in your
chastity and in your purity,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.123
then your morality is within yourself,
is not outside.

00:06:22.324 --> 00:06:24.706
Whatever people may say about Christ today,

00:06:24.907 --> 00:06:31.387
but you know as Sahaja Yogis that He was
purest of pure.

00:06:31.588 --> 00:06:37.618
In the same way, we should try to keep
our purity above everything else.

00:06:37.819 --> 00:06:41.517
The most important thing for us to be
pure people:

00:06:41.718 --> 00:06:47.553
pure from heart, pure in our morality,
pure in our thinking

00:06:47.754 --> 00:06:52.511
and pure in our rapport that we have
with others.

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:55.829
Not just a show, not just artificiality,

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.674
but from within we should feel that
oneness,

00:06:59.875 --> 00:07:04.476
that understanding that we are all
Sahaja Yogis,

00:07:04.676 --> 00:07:08.671
born of a Mother, and we all have to love
each other.

00:07:08.872 --> 00:07:12.163
That is the greatest blessings you could
give to Me

00:07:12.364 --> 00:07:16.775
and also the greatest joy for Christ,
to see that all of you

00:07:16.976 --> 00:07:23.647
are absolutely in unison and in complete
accord with each other.

00:07:23.848 --> 00:07:29.367
This is something one has to understand,
that He also said to His disciples that,

00:07:29.568 --> 00:07:35.064
“The greatest pleasure for me is to see
you all together in one unison.”

00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:39.831
But now the collective consciousness is
within your consciousness,

00:07:40.032 --> 00:07:42.532
you can feel the collectivity within
yourself;

00:07:42.733 --> 00:07:46.793
so it should be very easy for you to become
one with each other,

00:07:46.994 --> 00:07:53.202
to understand each other, just like a part
and parcel of one being.

00:07:53.403 --> 00:07:58.040
So I wish you all A Very Happy Christmas
and let us start this New year

00:07:58.241 --> 00:08:03.683
with the full idea that we have to have
that dedication of Christ,

00:08:03.884 --> 00:08:08.250
that understanding of Christ, how He
dedicated His life,

00:08:08.451 --> 00:08:15.305
which was very short, for the establishment
of purity in this world.

00:08:15.506 --> 00:08:19.200
If the Sahaja Yogis do not have that
personality,

00:08:19.401 --> 00:08:21.566
they cannot establish Sahaja Yoga anywhere.

00:08:21.766 --> 00:08:26.167
So the first and foremost thing we have
to aspire is purity,

00:08:26.368 --> 00:08:30.365
as you know very well that Adi Shakti first
created Shri Ganesha

00:08:30.566 --> 00:08:33.396
who is the symbol of purity.

00:08:33.597 --> 00:08:37.870
So today we have to take a vow, that
henceforth

00:08:38.071 --> 00:08:43.510
we are going to follow a life of complete
purity and detachment.

00:08:43.711 --> 00:08:47.014
That’s not so difficult if you understand
Sahaja Yoga.

00:08:47.215 --> 00:08:52.399
If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy
to purify yourself.

00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:54.842
I am so very happy you all could come here.

00:08:55.043 --> 00:09:01.822
Lots of inconveniences are there, but
as you being the saints now,

00:09:02.023 --> 00:09:06.970
don’t complain anything and you are
enjoying whatever is there,

00:09:07.171 --> 00:09:14.591
the pure air of this place and the purity
of nature that is around us.

00:09:14.791 --> 00:09:23.569
Let us also meditate and emit, manifest

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.831
that beautiful thing that is within us
which is the Spirit.

00:09:28.032 --> 00:09:32.965
And I am sure all this place will be
vibrant very soon,

00:09:33.166 --> 00:09:37.957
as it is I could feel the vibrations from
a very long distance when I came.

00:09:38.158 --> 00:09:40.515
May God bless you all.
