00:01.333 --> 00:06.507
Happy Christmas to you all.
May God Bless You.

00:28.273 --> 00:34.228
The birth of Christ is celebrated all over
the world,

00:34.429 --> 00:42.934
and it’s nice that we are celebrating here
at Ganapatipule His birth.

00:43.135 --> 00:47.749
As you know very well in Sahaja Yoga,
we have realised

00:47.950 --> 00:50.984
that the principle of Christ was
Shri Ganesha.

00:51.185 --> 00:54.943
So this is the right place to celebrate
the Christmas

00:55.144 --> 01:02.541
and the Birth of Christ is the - absolutely
coincides today

01:02.742 --> 01:07.985
and I am very happy that you have chosen
Ganapatipule for that.

01:08.186 --> 01:15.900
Now as you know very well, that Ganesha’s
principle became

01:16.101 --> 01:19.886
the principle of Christ at the Agnya
Chakra.

01:20.087 --> 01:26.032
And that’s a very important centre that
we have within ourselves

01:26.233 --> 01:34.985
which has given us a new dimension
to our personality,

01:35.186 --> 01:41.992
that we can resurrect ourselves as Christ
resurrected Himself;

01:42.193 --> 01:47.443
so the message of His life is resurrection.

01:47.644 --> 01:55.817
So from His birth He got His resurrection
done, in the same way

01:56.018 --> 02:04.120
you are born again when you get your
Resurrection, or you become Sahaja Yogis.

02:04.321 --> 02:08.567
On the same principle it works.

02:08.768 --> 02:16.063
But He had to physically pass through
all the penance,

02:16.264 --> 02:20.865
as we say that He died for us, for our
sins;

02:21.066 --> 02:28.244
but now as He has done that for us,
the Agnya Chakra is absolutely

02:28.445 --> 02:33.007
at our command, that we can open it out
whenever we like,

02:33.208 --> 02:40.084
if we are Sahaja Yogis, and we can
enlighten that Chakra also.

02:40.962 --> 02:44.187
This is the Chakra always caught up
by people

02:44.388 --> 02:50.787
who try talk about Christ, to say things
about Christ,

02:50.988 --> 02:55.905
or to profess that they have Christ
in their pockets,

02:56.106 --> 02:58.963
when they have no connection with Christ.

02:59.164 --> 03:01.673
Now, for this Christ has very clearly said,

03:01.874 --> 03:06.090
that, “You will be calling me Christ,
Christ, and I won’t recognise you”.

03:06.291 --> 03:09.721
There are so many people of this kind,
and that’s why

03:09.922 --> 03:16.017
the celebration of Christ’s Birth by them
is just a festival

03:16.218 --> 03:19.803
but has no deeper significance.
But for Sahaja Yogis

03:20.004 --> 03:26.586
it’s a very great happening, because
His birth

03:26.787 --> 03:29.790
has brought such a great Incarnation
on this earth

03:29.991 --> 03:38.887
and by that we could achieve our
Realisation because He is at the gate.

03:39.228 --> 03:46.713
So, today is the day of thankfulness
for Christ’s Advent on this earth,

03:46.914 --> 03:53.159
and we have to see that as He is our
eldest brother,

03:53.360 --> 03:59.592
we can say, He is our leader, we have
to follow His footsteps;

03:59.793 --> 04:05.395
in our Resurrection, we have to show
that we have imbibed

04:05.596 --> 04:11.472
the qualities which are Christ-like,

04:11.673 --> 04:18.873
illuminating the whole Universe with
our enlightened lives.

04:19.074 --> 04:23.477
The very big responsibility on Sahaja Yogis
to understand that

04:23.678 --> 04:29.113
when we are celebrating today the birth
of Christ, we stand for something

04:29.314 --> 04:38.214
very much beautiful, pure and glorious.

04:38.401 --> 04:45.834
Christ’s life is a - symbolically can be
called

04:46.035 --> 04:57.223
as the symbol of purity and holiness,
He was purity and holiness.

04:57.424 --> 05:04.127
When we talk of purity we may think
about outside purity,

05:04.328 --> 05:09.285
or maybe the purity of our writings
or talking,

05:09.486 --> 05:14.797
or maybe we are very sophisticated, or we
talk very sweetly, or we are very kind;

05:14.998 --> 05:26.587
but Christ was pure in the sense that
He was nothing but purity.

05:27.612 --> 05:33.503
And He went to this extent of purity,
that He said that,

05:33.704 --> 05:40.372
“Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”,
that your eyes have to be pure.

05:40.573 --> 05:46.688
Even up to the eyes. He said: “Thou
shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

05:46.889 --> 05:53.327
So, the lust and greed has to disappear
from our personality

05:53.528 --> 05:57.397
if we have to follow Christ, if we have
to understand

05:57.598 --> 06:00.957
what an incarnation of holiness He was.

06:01.158 --> 06:05.662
Holiness is very important today, when
in this ghor Kali Yuga

06:05.863 --> 06:10.134
you find all kinds of horrible things
happening.

06:10.335 --> 06:15.839
If you believe in holiness, in your
chastity and in your purity,

06:16.040 --> 06:22.123
then your morality is within yourself,
is not outside.

06:22.324 --> 06:24.706
Whatever people may say about Christ today,

06:24.907 --> 06:31.387
but you know as Sahaja Yogis that He was
purest of pure.

06:31.588 --> 06:37.618
In the same way, we should try to keep
our purity above everything else.

06:37.819 --> 06:41.517
The most important thing for us to be
pure people:

06:41.718 --> 06:47.553
pure from heart, pure in our morality,
pure in our thinking

06:47.754 --> 06:52.511
and pure in our rapport that we have
with others.

06:52.712 --> 06:55.829
Not just a show, not just artificiality,

06:56.030 --> 06:59.674
but from within we should feel that
oneness,

06:59.875 --> 07:04.476
that understanding that we are all
Sahaja Yogis,

07:04.676 --> 07:08.671
born of a Mother, and we all have to love
each other.

07:08.872 --> 07:12.163
That is the greatest blessings you could
give to Me

07:12.364 --> 07:16.775
and also the greatest joy for Christ,
to see that all of you

07:16.976 --> 07:23.647
are absolutely in unison and in complete
accord with each other.

07:23.848 --> 07:29.367
This is something one has to understand,
that He also said to His disciples that,

07:29.568 --> 07:35.064
“The greatest pleasure for me is to see
you all together in one unison.”

07:35.265 --> 07:39.831
But now the collective consciousness is
within your consciousness,

07:40.032 --> 07:42.532
you can feel the collectivity within
yourself;

07:42.733 --> 07:46.793
so it should be very easy for you to become
one with each other,

07:46.994 --> 07:53.202
to understand each other, just like a part
and parcel of one being.

07:53.403 --> 07:58.040
So I wish you all A Very Happy Christmas
and let us start this New year

07:58.241 --> 08:03.683
with the full idea that we have to have
that dedication of Christ,

08:03.884 --> 08:08.250
that understanding of Christ, how He
dedicated His life,

08:08.451 --> 08:15.305
which was very short, for the establishment
of purity in this world.

08:15.506 --> 08:19.200
If the Sahaja Yogis do not have that
personality,

08:19.401 --> 08:21.566
they cannot establish Sahaja Yoga anywhere.

08:21.766 --> 08:26.167
So the first and foremost thing we have
to aspire is purity,

08:26.368 --> 08:30.365
as you know very well that Adi Shakti first
created Shri Ganesha

08:30.566 --> 08:33.396
who is the symbol of purity.

08:33.597 --> 08:37.870
So today we have to take a vow, that
henceforth

08:38.071 --> 08:43.510
we are going to follow a life of complete
purity and detachment.

08:43.711 --> 08:47.014
That’s not so difficult if you understand
Sahaja Yoga.

08:47.215 --> 08:52.399
If you are Sahaja Yogis is very easy
to purify yourself.

08:52.600 --> 08:54.842
I am so very happy you all could come here.

08:55.043 --> 09:01.822
Lots of inconveniences are there, but
as you being the saints now,

09:02.023 --> 09:06.970
don’t complain anything and you are
enjoying whatever is there,

09:07.171 --> 09:14.591
the pure air of this place and the purity
of nature that is around us.

09:14.791 --> 09:23.569
Let us also meditate and emit, manifest

09:23.770 --> 09:27.831
that beautiful thing that is within us
which is the Spirit.

09:28.032 --> 09:32.965
And I am sure all this place will be
vibrant very soon,

09:33.166 --> 09:37.957
as it is I could feel the vibrations from
a very long distance when I came.

09:38.158 --> 09:40.515
May God bless you all.
