00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:07.370
It's a very great day for Me to
see so many Sahaja Yogis here

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.620
who are from this
country, Greece.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:19.940
When first I came
to Greece,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.900
I told My husband that this
country is full of vibrations

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.790
and there have been many
evolved souls in this country

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.810
but perhaps the people
have lost their heritage,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.230
but the vibrations are
in the atmosphere

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.520
and one day Sahaja Yoga
should prosper here very much.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:52.020
And somehow, we met some
bureaucrats who were Greeks and

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.890
the experience was not good with
them and My husband said

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.990
that, "If you said that Greeks
are really religious people,

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.210
then look at these people
- what are they doing to me?"

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.050
I said, "They may be bureaucrats
and all over, bureaucrats,

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.440
you can't say what sort
of people they could be."

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:17.010
But, on the whole, the vibrations
were very, very good, no doubt,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:23.210
and I went to all the places
in here, like I went to Delphi,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.370
I went up there to see Athena's
temple and everything.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.300
To all the places of interest,
they took Me round, especially Me,

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.110
because he was busy
with his conference,

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.280
and so they took Me round.
And everywhere I felt

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.100
even the sea I felt was
so beautiful. This was about,

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.320
I think I came here at least
about fifteen years back,

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.890
maybe fourteen years
back - and I find now

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.400
the vibrations are coming
back now through you people

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.100
and the whole place
is again vibrating.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.210
Now, you have to understand
that you people

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.810
have a very big responsibility
because you're

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.300
strategically placed
in Greece, you see.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:23.450
Creece and Italy, I mean Turkey,
both are very important.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.240
First of all, you are the bridge
between the eastern side

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.410
and the western side and
everybody is interested in,

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.060
somehow or another,
managing these two areas

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.670
so that hey could control
eastern and western side.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.090
I mean the western
countries especially.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.980
Now the greatest danger
that you have now

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.440
is that this western culture
may try to grab you

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:58.900
and which is very
dangerous.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.360
To understand it,
you have to know

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.460
that you are people coming
from a very great tradition,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.150
ancient people of ages
just like Indians,

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.450
and there is so much you can do
to improve the culture of Europe

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.730
by your own behavior.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.290
Like these people we have
coming here, tourists are coming,

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.890
and they see the
behavior of the Greeks

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.740
and they see that they
can influence very well,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:47.570
the Europeans, think that Greeks
can be very easily influenced

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.790
by their culture,
by their cheap life.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:57.370
So, as you being the
such traditional people,

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:02.940
down to earth and
so many, so many

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.090
good things you
have known in life,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.600
it's very important to
understand the historical

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.490
background of your country,
first of all.

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:20.850
For Sahaja Yogis it is very
important to be educated that way

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:24.000
because tomorrow you'll have
to talk to other people

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.470
and you'll have to tell them
about Athena, about your traditions,

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.410
about your background and how
it is connected to Sahaja Yoga,

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.880
connected to Mother Mary, connected
to Christ and all those things.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:44.290
For this, it is very necessary that
we all should try to understand

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.320
the historical background
of this country

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.810
and educate yourself in a way that
you can talk about Sahaja Yoga.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.890
As it is, you know, Athena has
the Kundalini in Her hand

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.890
and you can see that clearly
that She was the Adi Shakti.

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:06.890
Actually, in Sanskrit language
atha means primordial.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.690
So She was
the Primordial Mother.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.640
Because there was
no connection

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.570
left between the Greeks
and the Indians,

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.220
this, I mean, translation

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:23.210
was not there and they didn't
know what it meant by Athena.

00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:27.540
But Indians know that it
is this is the place

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:33.440
for the manifestation
of the Adi Shakti

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.410
because in the Devi Mahatmyam,
if you read, or you will find out

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:42.370
they have described Greece
as the Manipurndwip.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:49.250
Means the island in the Manipur.
Manipur is this Nabhi Chakra.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:56.220
So in the Nabhi there's an
island where it is your Greece,

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.850
where the Goddess resides.
Manipur chakra is where She resides.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.280
And so, this Athena has
been described,

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.630
and when I went to Her
temple I found that there was

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:17.000
a little temple for the child God.
That was Shri Ganesha.

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.740
And then, when I went to Delphi,
also, when I went there

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:24.050
I was surprised to see, they showed
Me a mound and said,

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:27.980
"This is the Nabhi, navel
of the whole universe."

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.230
I said, "That's correct." But when
I turned round there

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:35.910
were lots of vibrations and what
I find is a Ganesha statue there.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.760
Then Gregoire came here
he took photographs

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.160
and everything
and he saw that.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:44.950
So now you are the Nabhi.
You are sitting here in the Nabhi

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:48.280
of the whole universe.
So how important is Nabhi?

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.340
You know that very well,
that Nabhi Chakra gets spoilt,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:57.530
the whole life becomes
miserable for a human being.

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.330
So, on the right side of
the Nabhi, as you see,

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:08.630
is the liver and because, of course,
we had lots of philosophers,

00:07:08.940 --> 00:07:13.550
they used to think a lot and
they created lots of tragedies,

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:17.720
you see Greek tragedy's well
known, where a marriage system was

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.090
little bit challenged, that
there was, say, two men,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:26.780
one woman or maybe
two women, one man

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:30.260
and never they felt happy
with the marriage.

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:34.480
So the left Nabhi was
under attack, throughout.

00:07:34.770 --> 00:07:39.770
To have such a tragedy, they
wrote so many, I would say,

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:45.610
so many dramas and they played them
here and so many plays were there

00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:48.920
showing that there are two
men and one woman

00:07:49.230 --> 00:07:53.230
or two women and one
man and no relationship

00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:56.790
between the husband
and wife which was pure.

00:07:57.070 --> 00:07:58.430
And that was the tragedy.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.660
It's known all over
as the Greek tragedy.

00:08:01.930 --> 00:08:04.360
It's all imaginary
and people, you see,

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:07.860
became very left-sided to
begin with. They started thinking,

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:11.340
Oh, this life is a misery.
It's a tragedy.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.120
What should we do?
Why should we?

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:20.350
Why should we try to
show that we are happy?

00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:22.360
We are very
unhappy people.

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:25.800
And all these things
started here to begin with.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:29.240
Then came these
your Orthodox Church.

00:08:29.540 --> 00:08:32.770
Now this Orthodox Church is
another one, which, of course,

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.060
is really doesn't treat women
very well and treats them

00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:42.730
as if they are all the
time unholy. Certain times

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.460
they cannot go to church
and they cannot touch people,

00:08:46.730 --> 00:08:49.580
all kinds of nonsensical
ideas they had.

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:53.010
That also made women
very left-sided.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.030
Then, on top of that,
all this was happening

00:08:56.310 --> 00:08:58.290
with these tragedies
and all that.

00:08:58.700 --> 00:09:05.270
Suddenly the economic problem
came up and people felt very,

00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:08.670
sort of, disgusted
about that.

00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.120
So the left side
became very,

00:09:11.440 --> 00:09:14.920
very prominent here
and that is how I think

00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:17.520
many of these left-sided,

00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:21.700
bhootish organizations
started here

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:26.230
and many gurus came who
made you feel miserable.

00:09:26.550 --> 00:09:29.100
But the worst that was
done by the Greek Church

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.970
which made you feel so guilty.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:35.320
So you became
very left-sided.

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.700
Now this left-sidedness was
later on counter-balanced

00:09:39.970 --> 00:09:42.450
by people who started
becoming overactive;

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:46.680
thinking too much, working too
hard and all those things.

00:09:47.020 --> 00:09:50.360
But still, I think that they don't
work very hard as they should work.

00:09:50.620 --> 00:09:53.050
They're on the lazy side,
the Greeks are.

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:56.110
They're on the lazy side. Of course,
the Sahaja Yogis are not.

00:09:56.370 --> 00:09:57.830
The Sahaja Yogis have
worked very hard,

00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.150
I can see all that very
clearly, but otherwise.

00:10:01.470 --> 00:10:07.560
So, now to bring
out Sahaja Yoga

00:10:07.920 --> 00:10:11.180
in Greece, is important,
first of all, to know

00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.970
what is our historical
background.

00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:17.680
The second, they should
be very well equipped

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:21.110
with the knowledge
of chakras and centers

00:10:21.390 --> 00:10:27.500
and how to improve these centers.
If you do not have that knowledge,

00:10:27.750 --> 00:10:30.640
you cannot face people. It's not
that only men should know,

00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:33.550
women also should
know everything about it.

00:10:33.810 --> 00:10:37.440
What is the chakras are,
how they work out

00:10:39.030 --> 00:10:44.130
and what are their results
are, how do we suffer

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:46.610
because our chakras
are in danger.

00:10:46.910 --> 00:10:49.540
All this knowledge
is free to you.

00:10:50.010 --> 00:10:52.780
You don't have to pay for
this knowledge. Only thing,

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:56.650
every day-to-day life, when you
start working out Sahaja Yoga,

00:10:56.950 --> 00:11:02.360
then you'll find that what I'm
saying is absolutely tangible.

00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:07.690
You can verify it. It is so.
It's not something in the air.

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:11.510
It is absolutely there.
We can prove everything

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.400
that we believe in and we
can show others also

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:19.310
that this is the truth.
Is an absolute truth.

00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:21.800
We are not here to
spread some sort

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:25.670
of a fanaticism or racialism
or anything like that,

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.940
but we are here to combine
the whole world together

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:33.540
under one understanding; that
we belong to one universe

00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:37.600
and we have one
universal religion.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.480
Now, people will ask
you then,

00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.180
"Have we to give up
your religion?"

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.870
You don't have to tell them that
you have to give up your religion,

00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:46.900
don't have to say that. You don't
have to be hard with them at all.

00:11:47.160 --> 00:11:49.310
On the contrary, no, no, no,
nothing has to be done.

00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:54.170
You just come and take to Sahaja
Yoga and take to your spirit.

00:11:54.460 --> 00:11:58.060
Gradually it will start
opening out.

00:11:58.490 --> 00:12:00.260
It has happened with
all of you

00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:02.260
that first when you
came to Sahaja Yoga

00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.300
you were in a different
shape. Now gradually,

00:12:05.610 --> 00:12:07.200
you started opening
out, you matured

00:12:07.490 --> 00:12:10.190
and you understood
Sahaja Yoga very well.

00:12:10.470 --> 00:12:15.260
In the same way, you must
teach others in the same manner,

00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:20.370
with the same understanding,
compassion and love.

00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:23.780
Otherwise, normally people
think that somebody

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:26.390
is to be condemned
all the time.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:30.790
Of course, some are people
who are under bad influence

00:12:31.070 --> 00:12:34.850
and you cannot get along
with them, but most of you

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:39.330
should know that we have to get
more people into Sahaja Yoga

00:12:39.610 --> 00:12:45.860
through our compassion, love
and also lot of understanding

00:12:46.130 --> 00:12:52.390
about others' feelings. I've
found that even countries

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:55.530
where have been Sahaja
Yoga for so many time,

00:12:55.840 --> 00:13:01.000
suddenly someone comes up
and starts giving trouble

00:13:01.300 --> 00:13:06.290
and becoming bhootish sort of
thing, you see, and misbehaving.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:10.660
Suddenly, it happens. Such a person,
you know, if it is informed,

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.720
we can take him out of Sahaja
Yoga. We can cleanse him.

00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.700
But all of you must know
one thing for definite

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:20.410
that you all have these
powers to cure yourself,

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:22.910
improve yourself,
to help others.

00:13:23.190 --> 00:13:25.430
You can do everything
yourself.

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:28.440
You all have these powers,
but the only thing

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.750
is you have to be
sincere and honest.

00:13:31.090 --> 00:13:34.870
If you are not sincere and
honest, it will never work out.

00:13:35.190 --> 00:13:38.200
On the contrary, it will
boomerang on you.

00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:43.610
So, in Sahaja Yoga, it's very impor-
tant is the sincerity of purpose.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.680
You must have complete
sincerity of purpose

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:52.200
that you are here to achieve your
own self-emancipation, first.

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:59.660
And secondly, you are
here to help others.

00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:05.610
The people all along in the
whole world now require help.

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:09.680
There's so many problems,
so many catastrophes,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:16.520
so many horrible things
we everyday know going on.

00:14:16.770 --> 00:14:19.390
So now we need people who
are solid, who are balanced,

00:14:19.650 --> 00:14:23.650
who are peaceful, who understand
what is right and what is wrong.

00:14:24.350 --> 00:14:25.970
But apart from that,
you should know

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:29.860
that you have now entered
into the Kingdom of God.

00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.650
Many people will say, all right,
we were so religious,

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:34.880
we were praying to Christ,
we were praying to this one,

00:14:35.110 --> 00:14:37.790
praying to that one.
What did we get?

00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:40.660
You cannot get it because
you are not connected.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:44.300
You have to be connected. Once
you are connected to that,

00:14:44.550 --> 00:14:48.300
then you will find that
things start sorting out.

00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:52.240
But sincerity is very important
and faith in yourself.

00:14:52.650 --> 00:14:56.470
You must have faith in yourself
that you're quite capable,

00:14:56.700 --> 00:15:00.990
quite capable person and
you can achieve

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.800
a very high degree of awareness by
which you can work out many things.

00:15:06.030 --> 00:15:09.230
It doesn't matter from what sort
of background you come in.

00:15:09.510 --> 00:15:11.820
It doesn't matter from what sort
of country you come in,

00:15:12.080 --> 00:15:13.300
race anything.

00:15:13.570 --> 00:15:15.010
You all can do very well

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:20.250
and we have seen this happening in
so many countries where we had

00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:27.330
no hope at all. For example,
a country like Russia,

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:31.730
imagine, they've never
worshipped any God.

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:34.990
They didn't know about God.
They were not allowed to know

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:37.490
about any religion,
anything,

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.610
but suddenly I went there, I don't
know, they recognized Me, suddenly.

00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.030
They just recognized Me and
just with My photograph

00:15:45.370 --> 00:15:47.580
I find them there. I was
amazed that the first time

00:15:47.880 --> 00:15:56.560
I went to Leningrad there were
two thousand seats in the hall,

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.080
but outside they were
all standing. I said,

00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:01.010
"Why are they standing
outside?" They said,

00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.650
"All the seats are full, Mother,
and these are extra people.

00:16:03.990 --> 00:16:07.280
There are more than two
thousand outside." So I said,

00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.920
"This is too much." And so they
said, "Mother, what about us?"

00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.050
I said, "All right, let me
finish the program."

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:15.980
I went inside, did the program,
everything happened

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.410
and you'll be amazed

00:16:17.630 --> 00:16:21.130
when we had the program,
the people who were outside

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.390
were still waiting. I gave
realization to people

00:16:24.650 --> 00:16:26.490
and they were waiting,
waiting, waiting.

00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:29.340
When I came out
I gave them.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.460
I said, "Now, what to do?

00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:33.870
I can't give you
realization just now."

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:36.310
So they said, "All right,
what can we do?"

00:16:36.620 --> 00:16:38.490
I said, "Tomorrow morning
can you come?" They said,

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:41.990
"All right." So all those who were
inside and those who were outside,

00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:45.200
all of them came and
came and sat down

00:16:45.480 --> 00:16:50.450
in that open ground and
I gave them realization.

00:16:50.730 --> 00:16:53.820
So this is the first beginning,
but now in Moscow

00:16:54.100 --> 00:16:59.850
or any place we have to
reserve a huge, big stadium.

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:03.070
Fourteen to sixteen
thousand people are there

00:17:03.330 --> 00:17:06.990
and realization is
being given.

00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:10.010
But they are so quick
to accept Sahaja Yoga,

00:17:10.280 --> 00:17:14.700
so quick to accept Me, so quick
to understand Sahaja Yoga.

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:20.220
I just can't imagine how these
Russians have got this capacity.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.750
No question of their
going back,

00:17:24.050 --> 00:17:26.400
no question of their
sincerity being challenged.

00:17:26.690 --> 00:17:32.520
There is no question of their
doubting themselves, nothing.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:37.370
Just there and so much so,
so much that I sometimes feel

00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:40.150
this democracy has
just harmed us.

00:17:40.620 --> 00:17:43.590
Because of democracy,of course,
we could do Sahaja Yoga all right,

00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:48.860
but where the people are,
absolutely sometimes very idiotic.

00:17:49.190 --> 00:17:52.670
Like in America, I find there's
very idiotic people live there

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:57.490
and they were only busy
choosing their bathrooms

00:17:57.810 --> 00:18:02.070
and their curtains and their soaps
and all the time they will choose,

00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:04.810
only busy with all these
nonsensical things.

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:11.730
They are so idiotic, while the
people in Russia are so sensible,

00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:18.800
so deep, so introspective and
even the artists and the scientists.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:24.570
I had a conference with the scientists.
There were about three hundred of them

00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:27.000
and I started talking to
them about science.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:28.510
I thought, better start
with science.

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:30.420
They said, "Mother, no more
science, no more science.

00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:34.490
Tell us the science
of God."

00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:37.620
Such open-minded people.

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:40.740
We have two hundred
doctors in Russia

00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:46.020
who are practicing Sahaja Yoga
and it has spread up to Siberia.

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:51.500
Now, what's the use
of this democracy

00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:54.940
which doesn't take us to God.
It doesn't give us sense

00:18:55.210 --> 00:18:59.000
that we should seek God and
we should be humble towards God.

00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:03.230
So what's the use of having
this kind of a democracy and

00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:08.200
this kind of freedom which has
made us mad and idiotic?

00:19:08.610 --> 00:19:11.540
And that's very true about
every democratic country

00:19:11.820 --> 00:19:15.420
because you must know
democracy is money-oriented.

00:19:16.270 --> 00:19:19.590
And you know Greeks are very money
-oriented people also, as well.

00:19:19.870 --> 00:19:22.300
Of course, they're not
as bad as Americans,

00:19:22.590 --> 00:19:24.320
but they are quite
money-oriented.

00:19:24.610 --> 00:19:26.840
Also, Italians are very
money-oriented,

00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:29.530
but the worst is
the corruption.

00:19:30.050 --> 00:19:32.050
Now Italy is getting
exposed.

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.470
I'm sure your country will
also get exposed.

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.440
All these countries
are to be exposed.

00:19:36.710 --> 00:19:40.610
But, first of all, the Sahaja
Yogis have to be firm people.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:44.760
They have to be very, very
firm and they should know that

00:19:45.020 --> 00:19:47.330
Sahaja Yoga is only
spirit-oriented,

00:19:47.670 --> 00:19:49.470
nothing but
spirit-oriented,

00:19:49.740 --> 00:19:52.670
that you have to have
your spirit enlightened,

00:19:52.990 --> 00:19:56.180
that your spirit has
to work everything,

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.030
that you are not this body,
this money, this position,

00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:03.880
these powers, nothing.
But you are the spirit.

00:20:04.220 --> 00:20:06.940
This is what one
has to know.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.660
I was told it is very
difficult for you

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:14.490
to come for pujas
to Cabella

00:20:14.780 --> 00:20:18.410
you all cannot join,
but one week,

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:22.350
supposing you take
during Guru Puja, I think.

00:20:22.630 --> 00:20:24.810
You can come by boat
or something like that,

00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:28.430
would be easier for you to
come to Genoa by boat

00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.600
and then we can organize
your coming down.

00:20:31.900 --> 00:20:35.340
For Guru Puja, you all should
come. You see, Sahasrara Puja

00:20:35.610 --> 00:20:39.040
and Guru Puja are
very important

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:43.940
and if you could come for Guru
Puja, it would be a very nice idea.

00:20:44.440 --> 00:20:46.520
I think it can be
arranged and organized

00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:50.620
that you can come
to Guru Puja.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:54.190
I know it's wherever I am,

00:20:54.490 --> 00:20:58.860
supposing if I have it here, then
for all the rest of the people

00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:02.450
it will be far away. So
I just thought of Milan

00:21:02.740 --> 00:21:06.070
being quite in the center that
it would be nearer to England,

00:21:06.350 --> 00:21:08.780
nearer to other European
countries.

00:21:09.750 --> 00:21:12.420
You see, the Americans and
the South Americans

00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:15.500
find it very difficult,
so this time

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:18.030
we had to provide all
tickets, everything

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:21.820
to South Americans to come.
But they're very deep people.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:25.510
I was surprised in Colombia, they
are such good Sahaja Yogis,

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:27.550
very beautiful
Sahaja Yogis.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:32.130
Very simple-hearted, very
good, well educated.

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:36.870
Three, four of them got married
in India and they're very happy.

00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:46.880
So, now for that, two
things have to be done.

00:21:47.270 --> 00:21:54.720
Firstly, is that you
should come to collective.

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:58.000
It's very important. You all
should come to collective

00:21:58.280 --> 00:22:02.440
and put your - please put attention
to Me, not to them, alright.

00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:04.770
Please put your attention
towards Me,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:06.690
don't turn your attention
very much.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:11.590
You have to keep your attention
all right. It's very important.

00:22:14.770 --> 00:22:19.050
So you have to one thing is
to do, is to come to the collective

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:22.990
and watch out for your attention.
Where is your attention?

00:22:23.300 --> 00:22:25.840
Where are you looking? Are you
turning your head too much

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.540
or are you putting your
attention straight?

00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:32.170
It's very important that you
must keep your attention

00:22:32.430 --> 00:22:35.800
absolutely wrapped and
towards the meetings

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:41.540
that you have here for
your collective.

00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:45.640
In that way, when your
attention is fixed you'll find

00:22:45.880 --> 00:22:49.060
you'll definitely rise into
thoughtless awareness,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.580
a state where you
grow spiritually.

00:22:51.850 --> 00:22:55.760
You have to rise up to that
state of thoughtless awareness

00:22:56.010 --> 00:22:58.880
where you grow
spiritually.

00:22:59.190 --> 00:23:00.880
If you're not in thoughtless
awareness,

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.850
you cannot grow in
your spirituality.

00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:08.210
So it's very important to
see where is your attention.

00:23:08.450 --> 00:23:10.470
Where are you putting
your attention?

00:23:10.730 --> 00:23:12.810
If the attention could
be controlled

00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:15.140
then things will
be all right.

00:23:15.410 --> 00:23:18.290
He is crying,
the child is crying,

00:23:18.610 --> 00:23:22.030
may be you can take
him outside a litle bit,

00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:36.030
he is feeling hot I think
is all right now with the mother

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:53.220
So the first thing is to
be in the collective.

00:23:53.510 --> 00:24:00.430
Now it's a very sinister,
also idea of some people

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:03.630
is to always break the
collective, to create problems,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:10.340
to disregard the leaders. As a
result, leaders also get so fed up,

00:24:10.630 --> 00:24:13.210
they give up, you see. They don't
want to have anything to do.

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:17.980
So they put up their own ideas,
they try to trouble the leaders,

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:22.520
they create problems for them, they
just try to show off everywhere,

00:24:22.790 --> 00:24:28.440
as if they know everything. All
such people also create groups.

00:24:28.740 --> 00:24:34.790
So beware about them. You should
stick on always to the collective

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:40.770
and not to anyone who tries to
create a kind of a group at all

00:24:41.100 --> 00:24:46.660
or who troubles or who
makes things difficult.

00:24:47.230 --> 00:24:51.370
You must understand those who
are collective only will grow,

00:24:51.650 --> 00:24:56.740
those who aren't, will not grow.
Because like a nail, if it breaks,

00:24:57.020 --> 00:25:01.090
then it doesn't grow.
In the same manner,

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:05.080
if you keep out of this
thing, by any chance,

00:25:05.410 --> 00:25:07.360
if you have any problems
with the leaders,

00:25:07.670 --> 00:25:09.300
you can always
write to Me,

00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:11.490
you can tell Me,
I can work it out.

00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:16.370
But all the time, to go on
like this and grouping

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:19.570
like this will break and there
will be someone who'll do that.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.680
There will be some negative
person who'll try to do that.

00:25:22.930 --> 00:25:27.650
So, you have to be very careful
not to get out of the collective.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.330
You must always
support the collective,

00:25:30.580 --> 00:25:35.930
must help this collective
and must nourish it.

00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:39.960
As you know, I was
telling him also

00:25:40.250 --> 00:25:42.880
that he, if he has
problem with money,

00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:45.860
we can give money
from Cabella

00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:48.340
because before that I used
to travel on My own.

00:25:48.610 --> 00:25:52.530
Even to Greece, I came on
My own, and paid for everything.

00:25:52.790 --> 00:25:56.100
So, see also, then Stomatis
had to pay something,

00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:59.000
which I didn't like very much.
He was paying so much,

00:25:59.270 --> 00:26:01.080
because we had such
a small group.

00:26:01.350 --> 00:26:04.890
But now as you have a big
group, you feel responsible,

00:26:05.190 --> 00:26:07.510
you want to pay for it.
All right, doesn't matter.

00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:13.580
But not to pay for your Sahaja
Yoga, not for your realization,

00:26:13.850 --> 00:26:18.200
not for knowledge of Sahaja
Yoga. This is there.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:21.840
And so people will start putting
ideas into your heads that,

00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:24.160
Why this? Why that?",
and all that.

00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.270
Such people you should keep
out because you are here

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:30.000
to develop your spirituality
and not to listen

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.790
to these stupid people who
have been troublesome.

00:26:33.050 --> 00:26:36.300
So best is to keep
to your own,

00:26:36.990 --> 00:26:41.880
own development and own
nourishment. It's very important.

00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:46.270
So it is in a way collective,
but also individual,

00:26:46.550 --> 00:26:49.450
because what you're
gaining out of the collective

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.980
you should be on the watch
out, you should see for yourself

00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:54.420
what you are gaining
out of the collective.

00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.240
Then secondly, at home, you
must every day, every day,

00:26:57.540 --> 00:27:01.360
every day, again I say,
not to miss it out,

00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:06.320
in the evening before sleeping
you must have meditation.

00:27:06.610 --> 00:27:09.110
You can wash
yourself up, like,

00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:11.380
what you call, the water
treatment or anything

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.600
then sit down for meditation
for ten minutes.

00:27:13.910 --> 00:27:17.200
You must give fifteen minutes to
yourself and then sleep off.

00:27:17.490 --> 00:27:20.070
Supposing you can't do
one night, doesn't matter,

00:27:20.350 --> 00:27:23.700
but try to do it every
night. If not possible,

00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.150
if you don't do it one night,
you can do it in the morning.

00:27:26.450 --> 00:27:29.950
But it's very important. I can
easily make out a person

00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.480
who does meditation and
who does not do meditation.

00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:38.580
It's a difference, such a difference.
I immediately know a person

00:27:38.900 --> 00:27:43.800
who is meditating
everyday, in his health,

00:27:44.090 --> 00:27:48.620
in his face, in his behavior,
in everything, he's very different.

00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.120
And those who do not do
any meditation you'll find,

00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:56.320
not only that they are funny,
but their children are funny,

00:27:56.620 --> 00:28:00.500
their relationships are
funny, everything is funny.

00:28:00.850 --> 00:28:04.870
So the meditation is
a very important part for you.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.610
Because also the women
who are pregnant, when they,

00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.360
if they do not meditate
their children turn out

00:28:10.650 --> 00:28:15.420
to be very troublesome and very
funny. It's a thing like that.

00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:20.190
It effects everything. But your
character of meditativeness,

00:28:20.460 --> 00:28:26.240
your character of Sahaja Yoga
helps everyone, your children,

00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.910
your family, your society,
everybody,

00:28:29.170 --> 00:28:32.810
and everybody can make it out
what sort of a family you are,

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:36.450
what sort of a people you are,
what sort of a personality you are.

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:38.670
And from you they
take to Sahaja Yoga.

00:28:38.940 --> 00:28:44.610
So is important in individual life
also just to meditate, nothing else.

00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:49.920
You have to come to a state
of thoughtless awareness.

00:28:50.220 --> 00:28:52.770
So the mantra is, as
you know, Nirvichara.

00:28:53.020 --> 00:28:55.080
You should use the
mantra of Nirvichara

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.540
for coming to the
state of thoughtlessness

00:28:57.800 --> 00:28:59.950
and try to increase
this area,

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:02.150
this space of thoughtless
awareness

00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:06.530
and that is how you will find
you will be growing very much.

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:11.050
Now as you get lots of powers,
as you get lots of people

00:29:11.380 --> 00:29:14.070
being realized by you,
curing by you,

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:16.850
sometimes maybe it
might affect your ego.

00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.370
You might get into ego things.
For such people, I have to say

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:24.650
that you have to be introspective
and see for yourself.

00:29:24.950 --> 00:29:27.470
You face the mirror and ask
now how much ego you have.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:30.930
Laugh at yourself. Once you
start laughing at yourself,

00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:33.660
your ego will drop out
and you'll understand

00:29:33.910 --> 00:29:37.910
that it was false to have this
kind of ego within you.

00:29:38.200 --> 00:29:41.440
There are so many ways and methods
of finding out about yourself.

00:29:41.730 --> 00:29:45.000
Put yourself into bandhan and put
your hands towards the photograph,

00:29:45.280 --> 00:29:47.710
immediately you can feel what
chakras are catching

00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:52.010
and you know how to clear it out.
Also sometimes you feel it inside.

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.700
If your chakras are catching,
you can feel it inside

00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:00.090
and you can feel it,
the different centers

00:30:00.360 --> 00:30:02.710
on your fingertips
about yourself.

00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:07.380
So it is about yourself you will
know. About others, you know,

00:30:07.650 --> 00:30:09.750
you should just talk on
chakras. You should not say,

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:12.930
he's bhootish, or he has ego
- nothing. But you should say,

00:30:13.190 --> 00:30:16.430
his Agnya is catching,
means he has got ego.

00:30:16.750 --> 00:30:19.710
You can say, his Nabhi's bad,
his, this thing is bad.

00:30:19.970 --> 00:30:21.640
So the language is
to change now.

00:30:21.910 --> 00:30:26.960
We have to talk in the
language of Sahaja Yoga.

00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:31.520
It is to be understood that
now we are Sahaja Yogis.

00:30:31.810 --> 00:30:35.040
We've got the powers
we have vibratory powers.

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:39.940
But if you don't use these vibratory
powers, what is going to happen?

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:42.750
We have to use them,
that's the point.

00:30:42.990 --> 00:30:45.180
We always forget. I've
seen, the other day

00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:47.310
they couldn't open something.
I said, "Give a bandhan."

00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:49.990
Gave a bandhan and immediately
it worked out, you see.

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:52.220
Small, small things also
you'll be surprised

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.320
that if it doesn't work out, you have
to just give a bandhan

00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.030
and it works out.

00:30:56.370 --> 00:30:58.730
It is important to know
that you are Sahaja Yogis,

00:30:59.020 --> 00:31:01.650
you are saints and that
you can do lots of things

00:31:01.930 --> 00:31:04.200
and you shouldn't forget it.
You shouldn't forget it

00:31:04.450 --> 00:31:07.470
that you are Sahaja Yogis. Now
you are no more ordinary people.

00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:10.260
You are saints now and
you can do a lot.

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:14.510
All this, when it works out,
you'll be amazed at yourself how,

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:17.680
how you have achieved
all these things.

00:31:18.010 --> 00:31:21.140
And, I tell you, people tell Me
that they look like roses,

00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:24.210
all of their faces shining,
they look so beautiful and

00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:26.570
they can make it out that
you are Sahaja Yogis.

00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:29.290
I've seen at the airport
also many people say that,

00:31:29.590 --> 00:31:30.980
"Who were those people

00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:36.150
looking so sweet and beautiful,
shining. Who were those?"

00:31:36.510 --> 00:31:39.220
So if I tell them that they
are saints, they won't believe

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:41.970
that there could be so
many saints, but there are

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.570
and we have achieved
that all over the world.

00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:47.140
All over the world now there
are so many Sahaja Yogis

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:51.490
that I can't even say how many they
are, in thousands and thousands.

00:31:51.810 --> 00:31:53.970
So, I again tell
you that Greece

00:31:54.230 --> 00:31:56.300
is a place where
you can do a lot.

00:31:56.580 --> 00:31:59.600
First of all, you must establish
yourself in Sahaja Yoga

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:03.020
and you have to
know what you are,

00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:05.740
all the time to remember what
you are. You are a Sahaja Yogi.

00:32:06.030 --> 00:32:08.240
Even to children, you have
to say, "You are a Sahaja Yogi,"

00:32:08.510 --> 00:32:11.280
so they also develop that
personality by which

00:32:11.590 --> 00:32:14.460
they behave properly and
they behave in a manner

00:32:14.770 --> 00:32:17.530
that a Sahaja Yogi
should behave.

00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:23.690
So all these things are just
the preliminaries of Sahaja Yoga,

00:32:23.970 --> 00:32:27.790
but I am sure you must be
getting my tapes from Cabella

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:30.900
and you must be knowing
about all the deeper things

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:33.650
about yourself and
about Sahaja Yoga.

00:32:33.930 --> 00:32:37.750
It's a new age
that has started.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:41.360
The other day I said that the
Satya Yuga has started now.

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.090
So it will start exposing
all that is a-satya,

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.030
which is whatever is false.
All those who are false people

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:51.470
will be exposed and you'll
be amazed at the way

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:56.180
things will work out. And it's
such a great time you are born

00:32:56.510 --> 00:32:59.630
and it's such a great thing that
you have come to Sahaja Yoga

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:01.780
and that you have
got your realization

00:33:02.030 --> 00:33:04.050
and that you are
one of those

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:09.320
who have to lift the whole of this
universe into a higher awareness.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.630
Of course, we can't say
how many will be saved.

00:33:11.910 --> 00:33:15.810
It's another point because
what I know about is that

00:33:16.090 --> 00:33:20.720
in the evolutionary portion,
supposing we came from chimpanzees,

00:33:20.990 --> 00:33:23.950
many were lost
in between, you know,

00:33:24.250 --> 00:33:28.000
and there are so many
chimpanzees now left

00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:30.940
and there's the middle,
the people were lost.

00:33:31.230 --> 00:33:33.170
In the same way, many
human beings may be lost

00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:37.530
because of their stupidity, because
of their self-destructive habits

00:33:37.810 --> 00:33:40.040
that they have formed.

00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.280
But your responsibility
is very great.

00:33:42.500 --> 00:33:45.390
Don't think, I am just mediocre.
I'm good for nothing.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.010
Never. Never think
like that.

00:33:47.290 --> 00:33:51.050
You are all saints and you
are capable of great things.

00:33:51.370 --> 00:33:53.890
May God bless you.
