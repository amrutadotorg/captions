00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:06.720
Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Workshop for beginners Burwood Ashram, Sydney (Australia)

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.440
The question is: People even before Realization

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.080
having a certain level of awareness which was.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.040
Are they close to realization and what if they don't even meet you,

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:09.160
What is their position?

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:27.280
You have to know that you all have been seekers before

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.880
this is not the first time you have been seeking.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.520
So already you have reached a certain state

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.640
where you feel and you are aware that something more

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.760
has to happen to you, you are already ready for that,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.000
some of you have really taken birth in this time just for this.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.200
So, because I’m not going to talk of your past,

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.160
past is over now, we have to think of the present.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:01.000
One has to know that all of you, get Realization,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.600
some people have certain problems,

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.120
on their different centers as I told you,

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.960
different types of problems people have.

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.000
Because of these problems, the Kundalini goes back

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.320
to its attention because Kundalini has to look after your problems.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.000
She’s your mother so she goes there, attends to that problem

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.200
and again she rises. But only thing you have to learn,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:33.840
how to make her rise, how to cooperate with her,

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.720
how to understand your own problem and give additional help

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.400
to solve the problem.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.000
Now you will be amazed that you just get rid of your

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.160
false identifications with yourself.

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:52.080
You become absolutely detached from that,

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.320
because you start talking in the language of chakras and centers.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.880
You start saying that this center is bad, that center is bad,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.360
this is not alright Mother, that’s wrong with me,

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.560
that is wrong with me, that’s all. You don’t say I’ve cancer,

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.440
you don’t say I’m mad, you don’t say I’m egoistical.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.840
You just say : “Mother this center is not alright,

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.080
that center is not alright.”

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.240
Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:24.720
as -they are, the ones who really are the channels

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.800
for the energy of God to flow in.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.520
Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your chakras are.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:34.920
Are you clean or not?

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.320
Some of you will find cool breeze flowing alright in the hand,

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.200
but may be, one chakra is catching.

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.440
On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel the numbness,

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:48.800
you might feel also a kind of a

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:59.000
– we can say a kind of a tingling on certain fingers.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:00.600
Now wherever there is tingling,

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.800
you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.320
between those chakras and the Kundalini.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.360
So you should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.720
and also must know that every one of you

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.280
are part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.640
you are awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.080
Because if you suffer from some chakra, I can feel it.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.400
But if others, those who are not Realized,

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.480
I don’t feel it at all, I’m not bothered,

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.000
There can be any number of devils or anything,

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.440
doesn’t matter to me.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.880
But if you people, who are Realized souls,

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.920
have a slight problem immediately I know

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.480
that you have this problem, my attention is diverted to that.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.920
So you must understand that the attention is all the time there

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:57.520
to look after you, to give you a better guidance,

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.200
your Spirit is all the time working.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.320
But you must learn how to take the guidance from your Spirit

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.760
that’s the main point; so nobody is lower or higher as he said.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.080
I’ve seen some people who were declared as

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.280
drunkards, this, that, overnight, there are finished

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.040
[with that], they are perfect people, not only, but very good Sahaja Yogis.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:24.720
So, you see, all these clouds have come on the sky of your being

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.920
in this life time, doesn’t matter, makes no difference,

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:31.000
but your past is great, that shows.

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:34.200
So you don’t have to worry as to how far you are where you are,

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.480
there’s no degree or anything to measure it.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.880
They must be all aware already, otherwise you would not come to me,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.480
first of all. And to get Realization itself, is very big.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.000
Now there’s a very good seeker I know of, who came to me,

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.760
and he got his Realization but he did not feel it on his hand,

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.040
because he has a very bad Vishuddhi.

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.200
And with a bad Vishuddhi chakra,

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:01.560
you may not feel it in your hand, doesn’t matter,

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:05.120
but you’ll feel peaceful, you’ll feel joyful.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.520
And you can feel it on top of your head, or others can feel it.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:11.480
Gradually your fingers will start improving

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.840
and they will give you better results.

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.480
For example, people who do hard work with their hands,

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.560
also their fingers can be numbed,

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.680
so we have to use certain methods, like looking after our hands.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:26.840
This body now is a temple of God

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.000
so we have to look after it in a way, respectfully,

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:34.280
not for the way the – you see, the prostitutes,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.680
when they want to sell their body they look after their body.

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:39.400
No, but respect, with respect to our body.

00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.040
We have to look after ourselves in a way

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.640
that we should keep good health.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:46.640
And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga,

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:49.960
there are thousand and one things, which you have to know,

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.280
which is very easy to understand,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.160
and which will be told to you for no price at all, nothing.

00:06:56.280 --> 00:07:01.200
It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it,

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:03.960
that you should settle down, that you should enjoy.

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.320
So you don’t have to be so anxious about it.

00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:11.520
These anxieties must be given up, just try to understand your centers.

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.240
Now many of you who did feel the cool breeze.

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.200
But maybe, after some time, you may lose it, doesn’t matter.

00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:21.480
You’ll go up and down, like that, doesn’t matter.

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.400
It does not mean that you’ve lost it, not at all.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:29.320
Now supposing you try a method, a simple method,

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:32.440
that you first put your left hand towards my photograph

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:33.840
– just now you can try –

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.040
and right hand on the Mother Earth, let’s see.

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.400
Right hand on the Mother Earth,

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:40.160
that’s why I wanted to have it in the open,

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:43.400
but doesn’t matter now, this rain is good for you for the farmers,

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:44.240
let’s have it.

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:45.840
So now put your left hand like this,

00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.120
and right hand – those who are sitting can put up like that

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:54.800
Like this. Back. Right hand like this, right. Not left, right.

00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.680
[Yogi] …the ground. No like this.

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.600
Back. Yes, right hand.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.320
Now what we are doing, the left hand side power,

00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:06.480
is the emotional power.

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:08.800
Now if you have an emotional problem

00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:12.040
– say, somebody has been taking drugs,

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:13.680
he’s a left sided person.

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:16.000
Some drugs are, LSD and all that right-sided,

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.360
but most of the drugs take you to the left side.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:20.000
Gurus are left sided part.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.240
Most of these problems are mental problems, are left sided problems.

00:08:24.360 --> 00:08:33.880
But the problem of the intellectuals is right sided,

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.400
futuristic people is right sided.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.080
People who are running the rat race are right sided,

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:42.800
you see, that kind of over activity, that kind of things.

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:46.080
On the contrary, those who have taken to drugs are left sided.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:47.920
So first try with the left, let’s see.

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.240
Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:52.520
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.040
Now, put your left hand towards me.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:09:00.160
Gradually, you’ll find it will start flowing in you left hand.

00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:02.200
Is it flowing?

00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.800
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth,

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.720
because the Mother Earth takes away ;

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.880
you see, you are just earthing it, put it on it,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:14.000
touching it, touch, touch it, you see, you are earthing yourself,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:15.480
is a very simple thing.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:18.840
Now left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth,

00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:21.040
it’s true, but the best is to have a light.

00:09:21.160 --> 00:09:26.800
Now, say, if you have a candle,

00:09:26.920 --> 00:09:30.400
candle is the best, for left sided problems,

00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:33.360
candle is the best thing to take it.

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:37.920
Because left sided problems, we can say, are cold problems,

00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:40.720
or problems which arise from coldness.

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.080
You see, a person who becomes inactive.

00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:44.880
Now see.

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.520
You just put your left hand towards me like this

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:52.280
and right hand towards a candle.

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.120
You ‘ll be amazed, sometimes,

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:59.840
the candle starts burning “tac”and drop like that

00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.560
and sometimes it creates such black smoke that,

00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.000
if it is next to a wall, you might find the all wall becoming black.

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:09.880
It’s very interesting to see how the candle reacts,

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:12.360
but you must have a photograph in front.

00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:14.880
And there should be a candle in front of the photograph

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:18.200
and one candle like this to take it out.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:24.920
Right, now, see better?

00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:26.040
Alright?

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.840
You’ll feel it’s going down. You’ll feel from your head, you’ll feel,

00:10:38.960 --> 00:10:42.160
you see, the pressure is going down.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.000
Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that, back side,

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.120
not towards me, like that yes, yes. Now. Hum.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.400
Now put left hand, if you ‘re sitting on the ground,

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.960
it’s better to put towards me, left hand.

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:08.520
It’s coming, it’s going, it’s working.

00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:13.400
It’s like the energy, you see, that is coming through the photograph,

00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.240
it’s pushing it down towards the light,

00:11:15.360 --> 00:11:19.920
and the light burns it off : light gets awakened, by you.

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:24.720
It’s surprising but it does.

00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:27.960
It’s better now? See. We work out, we feel it.

00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:30.600
You will feel it yourself, there is nothing to certify.

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.120
You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:36.040
left hand towards me like this, yes.

00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:38.880
You all will feel it yourself.

00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.080
Now people who have been to gurus,

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:44.680
who have sort of schizophrenic attitude,

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:49.800
who are moody people, frantic, fits, they get all sorts of these,

00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:53.000
to extreme to the least you see, who are emotional,

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:56.800
some women who cry too much, hysterics, all those things

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.240
can be controlled by this simple method

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.360
of putting left hand towards the photograph

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:04.600
and right hand towards a candle.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:17.920
See, it’s working out?

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:27.520
You’ll feel the movement in your head you’ll feel. [Yogi] Yes.

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.920
Feeling it now. No?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:32.920
[Yogi] So, it’s not there.

00:12:33.040 --> 00:12:34.480
Now with the right hand up,

00:12:34.600 --> 00:12:36.480
those who are running the rat race,

00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:39.920
you see big people who think they must earn money and all,

00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:41.440
they are running in the politics and

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:44.320
all that kind of a – another madness they have. You see,

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:47.320
that’s also a kind of madness, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:52.160
So for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that,

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.440
they will have diabetes, they’ll have liver trouble.

00:12:55.560 --> 00:13:01.440
Now even for any organ, you see, any organ you take, say heart,

00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:07.280
in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ, two types of nature.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:12.880
One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:16.000
So supposing you are an overactive person,

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.040
then if you are an overactive person,

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:19.520
you are studying very hard

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:22.000
or thinking about the future or planning something,

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.840
then, you have a heart which is overactive.

00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:28.200
Or you have an intestine which is overactive.

00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.040
The liver is overactive, the whole system is overactive,

00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.840
you’ll have high blood pressure

00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.720
and all the problems of high blood pressure, constipation,

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:40.680
all these things go hand in hand in one personality.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.960
Then, another personality could be a lethargic.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:46.160
A person who has a lethargic heart,

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:51.000
may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that,

00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.720
because the heart doesn’t pump.

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.600
You may have a lethargic intestine, such a person might

00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.000
– whatever he eats you see, just goes to the bathroom,

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.520
sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver.

00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.840
When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies.

00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.400
Allergies are caused by lethargic liver.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:12.480
But, if you are an overactive person, if you are overactive,

00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:16.560
then the same liver which was giving you these allergies,

00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:19.480
will give you nausea, a feeling of a sickness,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:23.040
migraine, and vomiting, emesis.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.800
So there are two types of livers also.

00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:28.520
We have two types of kidneys,

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:31.560
two types of, everything is two types.

00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:35.800
So if you are a lethargic person, if you have a lethargic problem,

00:14:35.920 --> 00:14:39.200
then what you have to do is to use the light.

00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.440
For all the lethargic troubles, best is the light,

00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:46.960
to use the light for lethargic troubles, this is left side.

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.600
And for the right sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:56.080
Mother Earth is the best or water and salt.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:59.920
So water and salt is very good for people who are suffering

00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:02.960
from an over-activity. Now how do you do it?

00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:06.400
It’s good for both, but specially for them.

00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.680
Like you have to put both the hands, first towards the photograph

00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:12.240
both the feet in the water, with little salt.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:17.040
Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.000
equally the same, it’s alright, you don’t have to worry.

00:15:20.120 --> 00:15:23.360
But supposing, one hand is more and one hand is less.

00:15:23.480 --> 00:15:27.720
The hand that is less has to go before the photograph, always.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:30.960
The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph

00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:33.280
and another one has to go out.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:35.600
And you’ll be amazed, the movement of the thing,

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:38.760
you will feel within yourself these balloons will be moving like that.

00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:41.160
And you can feel it, that something is moving in your head,

00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:46.160
you are getting relaxed. And gradually, you’ll become a master,

00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.560
you will know how to handle this body,

00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.600
absolutely, you‘ll become a master. And when you become master

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:55.200
– people have become masters in eight days, in eight days.

00:15:55.320 --> 00:15:58.080
Once you become a master, then you can handle other bodies also

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:02.160
and help other people. It’s as simple as that.

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.000
So forget about the past, now the present,

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:09.640
we have to be in the present.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:12.640
Is there any other question now?

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:17.960
[Yogi] … about mantras…

00:16:18.360 --> 00:16:22.120
Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers,

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:25.440
and all these centers have got different deities.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.920
As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here.,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.560
Moses is here, Krishna is here. We have a chart of that.

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:35.440
We have books which will be given to you.

00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.440
Now, we have to make, you see-

00:16:39.560 --> 00:16:43.000
[Yogi] Excuse me. [Sahaja Yogi brings a big chart]

00:16:44.160 --> 00:16:46.680
Yes this is the chart, you see, it’s beautifully done,

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.160
this one is very clear cut.

00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:51.800
Now on different chakras, we have different deities

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:54.920
– come forward, you come forward and see, alright?

00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:02.640
Alright, just let him see. You can pass it on.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:04.440
[Yogi] May be there’s another chart.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:05.800
Another chart, alright.

00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:08.080
We have books, you see, why not give them books?

00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.520
[Yogi] …They can have the other books

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:15.640
Open the books, you have got the chart in the books. Can you see?

00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:25.080
Now gradually you see, we are trying to get a bigger place for you,

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:28.960
and we should really meet in a hall again. When are you going to –

00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:33.320
Sahaja Yogi :… they can meet here first until we get a hall

00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:37.240
Yes if you want, we might not be able to get but you can meet here.

00:17:37.360 --> 00:17:40.120
You can always come and find out. Now, what is it?

00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:42.840
There are books. Now, I’ll show.

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:48.560
These are small books just meant for the beginner, you see.

00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:52.560
Now here, this is all given in short.

00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.640
Now this is the chart you have to follow

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:57.680
– you can pass it on…

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:07.640
Give this to that gentleman also he wanted. Ah, you’ve got.

00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:09.120
Gentleman : I got it here.

00:18:09.240 --> 00:18:12.240
Oh I see. You also take.

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:17.680
Now. So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:20.800
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not alright. Alright?

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:24.040
And if you start saying the mantra of this one is no use.

00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:27.880
So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers.

00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:31.480
Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:37.320
on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers.

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:40.720
On this side, if you see it clearly?

00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.720
Now these are the numbers of the centers, alright?

00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:47.200
So then, and also here it is written in this chart,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:50.520
what are the different deities.

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:53.760
Now, all these deities should be first understood,

00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.560
where are they, and when you have to say the mantras,

00:18:56.680 --> 00:19:02.560
what you have to do is coil it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra

00:19:02.680 --> 00:19:04.080
– so have you given that?

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.680
[Yogi] It’s not in these books..

00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:07.000
But they will tell you.

00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:11.480
The pattern has to be like this, which says,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:15.480
whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete

00:19:15.600 --> 00:19:18.720
- I mean you are to be recommended, isn’t it? Somebody has to say.

00:19:18.840 --> 00:19:21.000
So you have to say that

00:19:21.120 --> 00:19:25.800
I am the one who has given you this knowledge.

00:19:25.920 --> 00:19:28.440
So just you have to use that particular thing

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:31.280
which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:38.800
And you have to use these names of these deities, different deities

00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:42.880
according, and gradually you’ll be amazed it will work out.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:46.160
But when you come here, they will tell you, it’s very simple,

00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:49.880
it’s very simple. But you must know where the chakras are.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:52.400
First of all, you must become sensitive.

00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:56.320
So I would suggest that you must start using olive oil

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:59.800
for your fingers and for your toes, you see,

00:19:59.920 --> 00:20:03.120
rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive.

00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:07.280
Because of various things, our hands have become gross, you see.

00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:12.000
To feel it better, use some nice olive oil, massage it nicely.

00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:14.480
And sometimes, if you wear the gloves in the night,

00:20:14.600 --> 00:20:18.440
they can soften it also. You must soften, soft hands are better.

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.440
And the nails should not be very long, not very badly cut,

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:25.080
sort of things you see, and they are to be properly done.

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:28.320
So that when you use on others, they should not feel hurt

00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:31.040
with your nails. But for yourself also,

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:33.160
you should not have very –right hand specially –

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.040
because you’ll have to use it like this here,

00:20:35.160 --> 00:20:36.800
say, you have a Vishudhi chakra,

00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:39.480
then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra like that

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.920
So what, actually, is the matter with you,

00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:47.200
is to be first heard. So first you have to understand yourself,

00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:52.120
what is your problem, what you are suffering from,

00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.200
and then, how to correct.

00:20:54.320 --> 00:20:59.080
If you could find out how to correct it and what is your problem,

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:05.480
then it is the easiest thing, is to coil a mantra to improve yourself.

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:07.560
Alright? It’s very simple.

00:21:07.680 --> 00:21:11.840
Now you have met me only a day back, I should say,

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:13.800
but you’ll be amazed the knowledge

00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:16.880
that you will have now about yourself, will be tremendous.

00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.280
So first is SelfRealization, means you know yourself.

00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:23.240
Once you know yourself, you start knowing others,

00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:25.840
because we are all collectively conscious.

00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.360
Those who are Realized souls become aware of others.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.560
So first of all, if you want to see your own vibrations,

00:21:32.680 --> 00:21:35.280
you have to put yourself into bandhan like this,

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.040
as I told you, like this.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:38.720
Now, let’s do it.

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:41.640
Put your left hand towards me.

00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.560
[Yogi] Like this towards Shri Mataji…

00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:06.000
Now, these are your vibrations, whatever it is, now check,

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:10.320
see now. Which finger is burning? See, carefully.

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.600
Now this is left Nabbhi. Now which one is burning, be careful.

00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:20.440
Pay attention.

00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:25.320
Which one?

00:22:28.440 --> 00:22:30.040
[Newcomer] [Inaudible]….

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.160
Which one?

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:46.320
May be he is constipated, is he? Does he get constipation?

00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:55.280
Yes, it’s the liver, sign of liver, you see and also constipated.

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:57.520
So he is more a right sided person,

00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:59.280
because right side is this thing.

00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:03.600
So he has to put left to the right, like this. Alright?

00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:06.800
[Newcomer] I’m just warm [?] and [?]..what could that mean?

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:08.280
You have a heart [problem]

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:09.760
[Newcomer] It’s allergy [?]

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:13.480
You put your right hand on your heart.

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.480
New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible]…. Rather warm.

00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:20.320
Warm? Alright, doesn’t matter, and the other one?

00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:27.080
Nothing. Alright. So put your left to the right. Left to the right.

00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:29.360
[Yogi] You take it- when She says left to the right,

00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:31.080
what you’re doing is not just this one,

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:33.200
put you are actually lifting the left side

00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:35.720
And taking the grace from the right.

00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.520
[Yogi] … because you’re balancing

00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:41.240
And taking the grace, you see, on the right side,

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:43.520
because right side is showing nothing.

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.200
If the right side is showing nothing,

00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.400
then what you are doing, you are lifting your left

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.920
which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down,

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.160
with your right hand. Left to the right.

00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.280
[Yogi] If you got problems on the right side,

00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:04.840
you take from the left side, and over the top

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.640
and bring down the grace into the right side….

00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:13.200
Then it’s the opposite, it’s as simple as that.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:16.240
If she’s not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand,

00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.800
then you have right hand problem.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:22.320
You’re not feeling any vibrations, hum?

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:25.200
And left hand, you are feeling what?

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:28.360
[Yogi] Slightly warm on the left side….

00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:41.160
So she has to go from right to left.

00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:45.280
Just do it yourself now, get into balance

00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.080
that’s the object of what Shri Mataji is saying.

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.720
[Yogini] Can we change hands?

00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:53.360
Yes you can, you change hands.

00:24:57.120 --> 00:25:00.760
[Yogi] Just to repeat it again, if you have abnormal sensations,

00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:04.400
heat or something in your right hand, that means there is a damage

00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:07.600
on that side, so you lift the left side

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:11.360
and you bring down the grace inti the right side.

00:25:11.480 --> 00:25:14.400
Just do that if you got that problem.

00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:15.960
Right to the left.

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:18.600
You take your right hand and put it like that.

00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:22.080
[Yogi] If you got it in the other direction, you change hand as She said,

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.680
and you go the other way. It’s as simple as that.

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.880
Until it balances, until it works ou t. Keep doing until it works out.

00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.480
Did you come to my program before?

00:25:32.600 --> 00:25:33.000
No

00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:35.200
That’s why. Just it has started, you see,

00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:37.600
you have to get your Realization first of all, alright?

00:25:37.760 --> 00:25:40.240
You come here. We’ll have to work it out, first of all,

00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:43.760
as your Realization has not worked out, that’s why. It just started.

00:25:43.880 --> 00:25:47.600
Hum? Let it work out. If the Realization works out,

00:25:47.720 --> 00:25:51.280
then only you can feel it properly. That’s why.

00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:56.040
Right side, not at all, so I was wondering why. Are you feeling ?

00:25:56.480 --> 00:25:59.560
Good. Left hand what are you feeling?

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.840
Cool breeze, in the left hand and not on the right. Alright.

00:26:04.960 --> 00:26:08.160
So what you do is to take left to the right

00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.640
No, with the right hand.

00:26:11.760 --> 00:26:13.240
[New Yogini] Oh, yes.

00:26:13.680 --> 00:26:19.560
Gradually when you practice you will know. Better now? Good?

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.360
Good! He’s alright.

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:24.320
Are you alright? How are you feeling?

00:26:41.200 --> 00:26:44.760
[Yogi] She’s asking you get heat on the left side or the left hand?

00:26:44.880 --> 00:26:49.720
You can get it on left hand or left side, anywhere. Where are you getting?

00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.080
Yes, you can get it on both the sides. Are you getting on right?

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:03.880
Then you put your left to the right.

00:27:04.720 --> 00:27:09.640
No, no, no, left hand towards Me, and right hand like this,

00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:16.360
Just raise it and bring it down like this. Don’t go back.

00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.920
Both the hands cool?

00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.920
Look at Me. Left hand to Me, like this

00:27:57.040 --> 00:28:00.640
and right hand you pick it up, come here and push it down.

00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:07.240
She’s alright. You're alright.

00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:11.200
What about you? Feeling cool breeze in both the hands?

00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:21.800
The balance, yes. You start feeling the balance. That’s the best way.

00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:26.480
You have a Vishuddhi that way. Doesn’t matter.

00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:31.920
You put your left hand at the back of your chakra, here.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:38.320
And put your right hand towards Me. Right hand.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.760
What about you? Are you feeling?

00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.640
Nothing? You never felt any cool breeze? Surprising.

00:28:44.760 --> 00:28:50.920
You come from which state? UP!

00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:56.320
[Hindi conversation]

00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.320
New Sahaja Yogini : How long does that type of things ..?

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.480
Split of a second.

00:31:46.600 --> 00:31:49.640
New Sahaja Yogini : How long will it last, balancing yourself?

00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:52.040
[Yogi] How long will the balancing last you?

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:54.440
Last? I mean there is no timing for it.

00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.400
It can last you for ever, but if you are a very wobbly type,

00:31:57.520 --> 00:32:01.080
it may a little bit drop on, but you have to know how to do it, you see?

00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:03.520
Now, we can say we are driving a car.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:05.400
Now, how long will it last there?

00:32:05.520 --> 00:32:07.760
As long as you keep it.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:11.160
You are driving this car, alright?

00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.760
Now, what is it? Are you feeling the balance now?

00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:14.800
[New Yogini] I? Yes.

00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:16.040
Good, then it’s good.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:18.560
[Yogi] When it becomes imbalanced, that’s when you correct it.

00:32:18.680 --> 00:32:21.040
[New Yogini] So, just trough the day, you just have to

00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:23.600
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now, if you’re in balance,

00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:29.480
there is nothing wrong, it’s alright, perfectly alright.

00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.840
[Yogi] Can you get it when you haven’t had the Realization. You mean the balancing?

00:32:41.960 --> 00:32:45.960
Have you got your Realization?

00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:48.400
That is the first, that’s the first thing.

00:32:48.520 --> 00:32:51.960
Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God, isn’t it?

00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:54.840
First thing is to have your Realization and then, now,

00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.280
put your hands towards me.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:00.560
[Yogi] Everybody should do that because

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:02.600
the more you put your hands to Mother,

00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.480
the stronger the vibrations will flow.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:10.000
Take this chance because it has to develop.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:15.800
It might be a little uncomfortable, but just keep your hands to Mother.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:20.920
You got the cool breeze in your hands, are you feeling?

00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:25.680
Start, close your eyes.

00:33:25.800 --> 00:33:28.920
What about you? No.

00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.840
[Yogi] Those who haven’t their Realization, put their hands up please.

00:33:33.960 --> 00:33:37.160
You come forward. I think best is

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:41.400
- and the rest of the people and Sahaja Yogis can see. Come along.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:49.360
Now these people can be taught by Sahaja Yogis how to give Realization,

00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:53.200
you are alright, three of you, go ahead. [People move]

00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:04.320
And the Sahaja Yogis can meet them and talk to them.

00:34:04.760 --> 00:34:06.240
Sit down, sit down.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.480
Just like this. Put your hand.

00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:57.960
Are you feeling? Do like that with your eyes, do a little bit.

00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.320
Just press them, press your eyes hard, very hard- thrice.

00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:07.200
Hard, press them hard, thrice.

00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:13.960
Alright?

00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:20.040
Not yet? It will come. It will work out.

00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.400
Watch me, watch me here.

00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:35.000
[Shri Mataji still holds a candle in front of Her face,

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:39.560
then in front of her right hand

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:43.280
and the new people are sent to another room

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:47.480
where Sahaja Yogis will work on them.]

00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:56.000
Please take the baby out a little bit, because everybody tries to meditate.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:58.280
Alright, just for a minute

00:39:07.040 --> 00:39:10.360
Don’t feel guilty, none of you should feel guilty.

00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:13.680
Everybody has certain problems still. You just go and say:

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:18.880
Mother I am not guilty. Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:23.880
There is nothing to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:27.520
Whatever you have done is finished now.

00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:33.320
You are entering into new awareness now. Into the kingdom of God.

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:38.320
Now you have become the spirit, and spirit cannot be guilty.

00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.960
Forget about the people who have not come today with you. Anyone.

00:40:12.080 --> 00:40:15.280
Just forget them. Just start to be yourself.

00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:20.360
They can come later on and you can give them the full advantage.

00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:57.240
Those who have got liver problem should take sugar

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.440
and they’ll tell you what is to be done.

00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:06.640
If you have diabetes you can take salt.

00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:10.600
And for other people who have arthritis and all that also,

00:41:10.720 --> 00:41:13.920
I’ll ask you to bring some petrol or kerosene on,

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.680
if not you can come back again and take it from these.

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:20.400
Thank you very much. Enjoy your life.

00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.000
May God bless you!
