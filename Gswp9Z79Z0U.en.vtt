00:00.600 --> 00:06.720
Talk to Sahaja Yogis, Workshop for beginners Burwood Ashram, Sydney (Australia)

00:54.040 --> 00:58.440
The question is: People even before Realization

00:59.240 --> 01:02.080
having a certain level of awareness which was.

01:02.200 --> 01:06.040
Are they close to realization and what if they don't even meet you,

01:06.160 --> 01:09.160
What is their position?

01:19.760 --> 01:27.280
You have to know that you all have been seekers before

01:27.400 --> 01:30.880
this is not the first time you have been seeking.

01:31.000 --> 01:34.520
So already you have reached a certain state

01:34.640 --> 01:37.640
where you feel and you are aware that something more

01:37.760 --> 01:40.760
has to happen to you, you are already ready for that,

01:40.880 --> 01:45.000
some of you have really taken birth in this time just for this.

01:45.240 --> 01:49.200
So, because I’m not going to talk of your past,

01:49.320 --> 01:54.160
past is over now, we have to think of the present.

01:54.880 --> 02:01.000
One has to know that all of you, get Realization,

02:01.120 --> 02:03.600
some people have certain problems,

02:03.720 --> 02:07.120
on their different centers as I told you,

02:07.240 --> 02:10.960
different types of problems people have.

02:11.280 --> 02:16.000
Because of these problems, the Kundalini goes back

02:16.320 --> 02:23.320
to its attention because Kundalini has to look after your problems.

02:23.400 --> 02:27.000
She’s your mother so she goes there, attends to that problem

02:27.120 --> 02:30.200
and again she rises. But only thing you have to learn,

02:30.320 --> 02:33.840
how to make her rise, how to cooperate with her,

02:33.960 --> 02:37.720
how to understand your own problem and give additional help

02:37.840 --> 02:39.400
to solve the problem.

02:39.520 --> 02:45.000
Now you will be amazed that you just get rid of your

02:45.120 --> 02:48.160
false identifications with yourself.

02:48.280 --> 02:52.080
You become absolutely detached from that,

02:52.200 --> 02:56.320
because you start talking in the language of chakras and centers.

02:56.440 --> 02:59.880
You start saying that this center is bad, that center is bad,

03:00.000 --> 03:02.360
this is not alright Mother, that’s wrong with me,

03:02.480 --> 03:05.560
that is wrong with me, that’s all. You don’t say I’ve cancer,

03:05.680 --> 03:08.440
you don’t say I’m mad, you don’t say I’m egoistical.

03:08.560 --> 03:10.840
You just say : “Mother this center is not alright,

03:10.960 --> 03:12.080
that center is not alright.”

03:12.200 --> 03:17.240
Depending on the quality of your centers, the chakras,

03:17.360 --> 03:24.720
as -they are, the ones who really are the channels

03:24.840 --> 03:28.800
for the energy of God to flow in.

03:28.920 --> 03:33.520
Regarding them, you have to be careful, how your chakras are.

03:33.640 --> 03:34.920
Are you clean or not?

03:35.040 --> 03:38.320
Some of you will find cool breeze flowing alright in the hand,

03:38.440 --> 03:41.200
but may be, one chakra is catching.

03:41.320 --> 03:45.440
On one chakra you will feel the heat, or you may feel the numbness,

03:45.560 --> 03:48.800
you might feel also a kind of a

03:53.120 --> 03:59.000
– we can say a kind of a tingling on certain fingers.

03:59.120 --> 04:00.600
Now wherever there is tingling,

04:00.720 --> 04:04.800
you must know there is a kind of a struggle going on

04:04.920 --> 04:08.320
between those chakras and the Kundalini.

04:08.440 --> 04:13.360
So you should just try to help your chakras, to awaken them

04:13.480 --> 04:16.720
and also must know that every one of you

04:16.840 --> 04:20.280
are part and parcel of the whole. You are awakened,

04:20.400 --> 04:24.640
you are awakened to that part and so you have to be more careful.

04:24.760 --> 04:29.080
Because if you suffer from some chakra, I can feel it.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.400
But if others, those who are not Realized,

04:31.520 --> 04:34.480
I don’t feel it at all, I’m not bothered,

04:34.800 --> 04:37.000
There can be any number of devils or anything,

04:37.120 --> 04:38.440
doesn’t matter to me.

04:38.560 --> 04:40.880
But if you people, who are Realized souls,

04:41.000 --> 04:42.920
have a slight problem immediately I know

04:43.040 --> 04:46.480
that you have this problem, my attention is diverted to that.

04:46.600 --> 04:49.920
So you must understand that the attention is all the time there

04:50.040 --> 04:57.520
to look after you, to give you a better guidance,

04:57.640 --> 05:00.200
your Spirit is all the time working.

05:00.320 --> 05:04.320
But you must learn how to take the guidance from your Spirit

05:04.440 --> 05:08.760
that’s the main point; so nobody is lower or higher as he said.

05:08.880 --> 05:13.080
I’ve seen some people who were declared as

05:13.240 --> 05:16.280
drunkards, this, that, overnight, there are finished

05:16.400 --> 05:20.040
[with that], they are perfect people, not only, but very good Sahaja Yogis.

05:20.160 --> 05:24.720
So, you see, all these clouds have come on the sky of your being

05:24.840 --> 05:27.920
in this life time, doesn’t matter, makes no difference,

05:28.040 --> 05:31.000
but your past is great, that shows.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.200
So you don’t have to worry as to how far you are where you are,

05:34.320 --> 05:37.480
there’s no degree or anything to measure it.

05:37.600 --> 05:40.880
They must be all aware already, otherwise you would not come to me,

05:41.000 --> 05:45.480
first of all. And to get Realization itself, is very big.

05:45.600 --> 05:49.000
Now there’s a very good seeker I know of, who came to me,

05:49.120 --> 05:53.760
and he got his Realization but he did not feel it on his hand,

05:53.880 --> 05:57.040
because he has a very bad Vishuddhi.

05:57.160 --> 05:59.200
And with a bad Vishuddhi chakra,

05:59.320 --> 06:01.560
you may not feel it in your hand, doesn’t matter,

06:01.680 --> 06:05.120
but you’ll feel peaceful, you’ll feel joyful.

06:05.240 --> 06:08.520
And you can feel it on top of your head, or others can feel it.

06:08.640 --> 06:11.480
Gradually your fingers will start improving

06:11.600 --> 06:13.840
and they will give you better results.

06:13.960 --> 06:17.480
For example, people who do hard work with their hands,

06:17.600 --> 06:20.560
also their fingers can be numbed,

06:20.680 --> 06:24.680
so we have to use certain methods, like looking after our hands.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.840
This body now is a temple of God

06:26.960 --> 06:30.000
so we have to look after it in a way, respectfully,

06:30.120 --> 06:34.280
not for the way the – you see, the prostitutes,

06:34.400 --> 06:36.680
when they want to sell their body they look after their body.

06:36.800 --> 06:39.400
No, but respect, with respect to our body.

06:39.520 --> 06:42.040
We have to look after ourselves in a way

06:42.160 --> 06:44.640
that we should keep good health.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.640
And to keep good health in Sahaja Yoga,

06:46.760 --> 06:49.960
there are thousand and one things, which you have to know,

06:50.080 --> 06:52.280
which is very easy to understand,

06:52.400 --> 06:56.160
and which will be told to you for no price at all, nothing.

06:56.280 --> 07:01.200
It is the Divine that is anxious that you should get it,

07:01.320 --> 07:03.960
that you should settle down, that you should enjoy.

07:04.080 --> 07:06.320
So you don’t have to be so anxious about it.

07:06.440 --> 07:11.520
These anxieties must be given up, just try to understand your centers.

07:11.640 --> 07:14.240
Now many of you who did feel the cool breeze.

07:14.360 --> 07:17.200
But maybe, after some time, you may lose it, doesn’t matter.

07:17.320 --> 07:21.480
You’ll go up and down, like that, doesn’t matter.

07:21.600 --> 07:25.400
It does not mean that you’ve lost it, not at all.

07:25.520 --> 07:29.320
Now supposing you try a method, a simple method,

07:29.440 --> 07:32.440
that you first put your left hand towards my photograph

07:32.560 --> 07:33.840
– just now you can try –

07:33.960 --> 07:37.040
and right hand on the Mother Earth, let’s see.

07:37.160 --> 07:38.400
Right hand on the Mother Earth,

07:38.520 --> 07:40.160
that’s why I wanted to have it in the open,

07:40.280 --> 07:43.400
but doesn’t matter now, this rain is good for you for the farmers,

07:43.520 --> 07:44.240
let’s have it.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.840
So now put your left hand like this,

07:45.960 --> 07:49.120
and right hand – those who are sitting can put up like that

07:49.240 --> 07:54.800
Like this. Back. Right hand like this, right. Not left, right.

07:56.920 --> 07:59.680
[Yogi] …the ground. No like this.

07:59.800 --> 08:01.600
Back. Yes, right hand.

08:01.720 --> 08:04.320
Now what we are doing, the left hand side power,

08:04.400 --> 08:06.480
is the emotional power.

08:06.600 --> 08:08.800
Now if you have an emotional problem

08:08.920 --> 08:12.040
– say, somebody has been taking drugs,

08:12.160 --> 08:13.680
he’s a left sided person.

08:13.800 --> 08:16.000
Some drugs are, LSD and all that right-sided,

08:16.120 --> 08:18.360
but most of the drugs take you to the left side.

08:18.480 --> 08:20.000
Gurus are left sided part.

08:20.120 --> 08:24.240
Most of these problems are mental problems, are left sided problems.

08:24.360 --> 08:33.880
But the problem of the intellectuals is right sided,

08:34.000 --> 08:36.400
futuristic people is right sided.

08:36.480 --> 08:39.080
People who are running the rat race are right sided,

08:39.200 --> 08:42.800
you see, that kind of over activity, that kind of things.

08:42.920 --> 08:46.080
On the contrary, those who have taken to drugs are left sided.

08:46.200 --> 08:47.920
So first try with the left, let’s see.

08:48.040 --> 08:50.240
Now put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.520
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth.

08:52.640 --> 08:55.040
Now, put your left hand towards me.

08:55.160 --> 09:00.160
Gradually, you’ll find it will start flowing in you left hand.

09:00.280 --> 09:02.200
Is it flowing?

09:02.760 --> 09:04.800
Put your right hand on the Mother Earth,

09:04.920 --> 09:06.720
because the Mother Earth takes away ;

09:06.840 --> 09:09.880
you see, you are just earthing it, put it on it,

09:10.000 --> 09:14.000
touching it, touch, touch it, you see, you are earthing yourself,

09:14.120 --> 09:15.480
is a very simple thing.

09:15.600 --> 09:18.840
Now left sided problems easily go to Mother Earth,

09:18.960 --> 09:21.040
it’s true, but the best is to have a light.

09:21.160 --> 09:26.800
Now, say, if you have a candle,

09:26.920 --> 09:30.400
candle is the best, for left sided problems,

09:30.520 --> 09:33.360
candle is the best thing to take it.

09:34.360 --> 09:37.920
Because left sided problems, we can say, are cold problems,

09:38.040 --> 09:40.720
or problems which arise from coldness.

09:40.840 --> 09:43.080
You see, a person who becomes inactive.

09:43.200 --> 09:44.880
Now see.

09:46.040 --> 09:48.520
You just put your left hand towards me like this

09:48.640 --> 09:52.280
and right hand towards a candle.

09:55.240 --> 09:57.120
You ‘ll be amazed, sometimes,

09:57.240 --> 09:59.840
the candle starts burning “tac”and drop like that

09:59.960 --> 10:02.560
and sometimes it creates such black smoke that,

10:02.680 --> 10:07.000
if it is next to a wall, you might find the all wall becoming black.

10:07.120 --> 10:09.880
It’s very interesting to see how the candle reacts,

10:09.960 --> 10:12.360
but you must have a photograph in front.

10:12.480 --> 10:14.880
And there should be a candle in front of the photograph

10:15.000 --> 10:18.200
and one candle like this to take it out.

10:21.960 --> 10:24.920
Right, now, see better?

10:25.040 --> 10:26.040
Alright?

10:35.000 --> 10:38.840
You’ll feel it’s going down. You’ll feel from your head, you’ll feel,

10:38.960 --> 10:42.160
you see, the pressure is going down.

10:47.240 --> 10:52.000
Better now? Like this. Put the hand like that, back side,

10:52.120 --> 10:55.120
not towards me, like that yes, yes. Now. Hum.

10:59.200 --> 11:01.400
Now put left hand, if you ‘re sitting on the ground,

11:01.520 --> 11:04.960
it’s better to put towards me, left hand.

11:05.320 --> 11:08.520
It’s coming, it’s going, it’s working.

11:10.040 --> 11:13.400
It’s like the energy, you see, that is coming through the photograph,

11:13.520 --> 11:15.240
it’s pushing it down towards the light,

11:15.360 --> 11:19.920
and the light burns it off : light gets awakened, by you.

11:21.800 --> 11:24.720
It’s surprising but it does.

11:24.880 --> 11:27.960
It’s better now? See. We work out, we feel it.

11:28.080 --> 11:30.600
You will feel it yourself, there is nothing to certify.

11:30.720 --> 11:33.120
You will feel yourself. Put your left hand towards me,

11:33.240 --> 11:36.040
left hand towards me like this, yes.

11:36.160 --> 11:38.880
You all will feel it yourself.

11:39.000 --> 11:41.080
Now people who have been to gurus,

11:41.200 --> 11:44.680
who have sort of schizophrenic attitude,

11:44.800 --> 11:49.800
who are moody people, frantic, fits, they get all sorts of these,

11:49.920 --> 11:53.000
to extreme to the least you see, who are emotional,

11:53.120 --> 11:56.800
some women who cry too much, hysterics, all those things

11:56.920 --> 11:59.240
can be controlled by this simple method

11:59.360 --> 12:01.360
of putting left hand towards the photograph

12:01.480 --> 12:04.600
and right hand towards a candle.

12:16.040 --> 12:17.920
See, it’s working out?

12:24.520 --> 12:27.520
You’ll feel the movement in your head you’ll feel. [Yogi] Yes.

12:27.640 --> 12:29.920
Feeling it now. No?

12:31.120 --> 12:32.920
[Yogi] So, it’s not there.

12:33.040 --> 12:34.480
Now with the right hand up,

12:34.600 --> 12:36.480
those who are running the rat race,

12:36.600 --> 12:39.920
you see big people who think they must earn money and all,

12:40.040 --> 12:41.440
they are running in the politics and

12:41.560 --> 12:44.320
all that kind of a – another madness they have. You see,

12:44.440 --> 12:47.320
that’s also a kind of madness, you see. [Shri Mataji laughs]

12:47.440 --> 12:52.160
So for such people who are having a high blood pressure because of that,

12:52.280 --> 12:55.440
they will have diabetes, they’ll have liver trouble.

12:55.560 --> 13:01.440
Now even for any organ, you see, any organ you take, say heart,

13:01.560 --> 13:07.280
in Sahaja Yoga we have for every organ, two types of nature.

13:07.400 --> 13:12.880
One is the one that is lethargic and another that is overactive.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
So supposing you are an overactive person,

13:16.120 --> 13:18.040
then if you are an overactive person,

13:18.160 --> 13:19.520
you are studying very hard

13:19.640 --> 13:22.000
or thinking about the future or planning something,

13:22.120 --> 13:25.840
then, you have a heart which is overactive.

13:25.960 --> 13:28.200
Or you have an intestine which is overactive.

13:28.320 --> 13:31.040
The liver is overactive, the whole system is overactive,

13:31.160 --> 13:32.840
you’ll have high blood pressure

13:32.960 --> 13:35.720
and all the problems of high blood pressure, constipation,

13:35.840 --> 13:40.680
all these things go hand in hand in one personality.

13:40.840 --> 13:43.960
Then, another personality could be a lethargic.

13:44.080 --> 13:46.160
A person who has a lethargic heart,

13:46.280 --> 13:51.000
may get a- has to get a bypass or something like that,

13:51.120 --> 13:53.720
because the heart doesn’t pump.

13:53.840 --> 13:56.600
You may have a lethargic intestine, such a person might

13:56.720 --> 14:00.000
– whatever he eats you see, just goes to the bathroom,

14:00.120 --> 14:02.520
sort of a thing or may be a lethargic liver.

14:02.640 --> 14:05.840
When you have a lethargic liver then you might get allergies.

14:05.960 --> 14:08.400
Allergies are caused by lethargic liver.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.480
But, if you are an overactive person, if you are overactive,

14:12.600 --> 14:16.560
then the same liver which was giving you these allergies,

14:16.680 --> 14:19.480
will give you nausea, a feeling of a sickness,

14:19.600 --> 14:23.040
migraine, and vomiting, emesis.

14:23.200 --> 14:25.800
So there are two types of livers also.

14:25.920 --> 14:28.520
We have two types of kidneys,

14:28.640 --> 14:31.560
two types of, everything is two types.

14:31.680 --> 14:35.800
So if you are a lethargic person, if you have a lethargic problem,

14:35.920 --> 14:39.200
then what you have to do is to use the light.

14:39.320 --> 14:42.440
For all the lethargic troubles, best is the light,

14:42.560 --> 14:46.960
to use the light for lethargic troubles, this is left side.

14:47.080 --> 14:51.600
And for the right sidedness, you can use the Mother Earth.

14:53.000 --> 14:56.080
Mother Earth is the best or water and salt.

14:56.200 --> 14:59.920
So water and salt is very good for people who are suffering

15:00.040 --> 15:02.960
from an over-activity. Now how do you do it?

15:03.080 --> 15:06.400
It’s good for both, but specially for them.

15:06.520 --> 15:09.680
Like you have to put both the hands, first towards the photograph

15:09.800 --> 15:12.240
both the feet in the water, with little salt.

15:12.360 --> 15:17.040
Now if you are feeling the vibrations coming in both the hands,

15:17.160 --> 15:20.000
equally the same, it’s alright, you don’t have to worry.

15:20.120 --> 15:23.360
But supposing, one hand is more and one hand is less.

15:23.480 --> 15:27.720
The hand that is less has to go before the photograph, always.

15:27.840 --> 15:30.960
The hand that is less has to go towards the photograph

15:31.120 --> 15:33.280
and another one has to go out.

15:33.400 --> 15:35.600
And you’ll be amazed, the movement of the thing,

15:35.720 --> 15:38.760
you will feel within yourself these balloons will be moving like that.

15:38.880 --> 15:41.160
And you can feel it, that something is moving in your head,

15:41.280 --> 15:46.160
you are getting relaxed. And gradually, you’ll become a master,

15:46.280 --> 15:48.560
you will know how to handle this body,

15:48.680 --> 15:51.600
absolutely, you‘ll become a master. And when you become master

15:51.720 --> 15:55.200
– people have become masters in eight days, in eight days.

15:55.320 --> 15:58.080
Once you become a master, then you can handle other bodies also

15:58.200 --> 16:02.160
and help other people. It’s as simple as that.

16:03.640 --> 16:07.000
So forget about the past, now the present,

16:07.120 --> 16:09.640
we have to be in the present.

16:09.760 --> 16:12.640
Is there any other question now?

16:14.720 --> 16:17.960
[Yogi] … about mantras…

16:18.360 --> 16:22.120
Mantras, yes. Now, we have got different centers,

16:22.240 --> 16:25.440
and all these centers have got different deities.

16:25.560 --> 16:27.920
As I told you, Lord Jesus Christ is here.,

16:28.040 --> 16:32.560
Moses is here, Krishna is here. We have a chart of that.

16:32.680 --> 16:35.440
We have books which will be given to you.

16:35.560 --> 16:39.440
Now, we have to make, you see-

16:39.560 --> 16:43.000
[Yogi] Excuse me. [Sahaja Yogi brings a big chart]

16:44.160 --> 16:46.680
Yes this is the chart, you see, it’s beautifully done,

16:46.800 --> 16:49.160
this one is very clear cut.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.800
Now on different chakras, we have different deities

16:51.920 --> 16:54.920
– come forward, you come forward and see, alright?

16:59.160 --> 17:02.640
Alright, just let him see. You can pass it on.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.440
[Yogi] May be there’s another chart.

17:04.560 --> 17:05.800
Another chart, alright.

17:05.920 --> 17:08.080
We have books, you see, why not give them books?

17:08.200 --> 17:10.520
[Yogi] …They can have the other books

17:10.640 --> 17:15.640
Open the books, you have got the chart in the books. Can you see?

17:20.120 --> 17:25.080
Now gradually you see, we are trying to get a bigger place for you,

17:25.200 --> 17:28.960
and we should really meet in a hall again. When are you going to –

17:29.080 --> 17:33.320
Sahaja Yogi :… they can meet here first until we get a hall

17:33.440 --> 17:37.240
Yes if you want, we might not be able to get but you can meet here.

17:37.360 --> 17:40.120
You can always come and find out. Now, what is it?

17:40.240 --> 17:42.840
There are books. Now, I’ll show.

17:44.280 --> 17:48.560
These are small books just meant for the beginner, you see.

17:48.680 --> 17:52.560
Now here, this is all given in short.

17:52.680 --> 17:55.640
Now this is the chart you have to follow

17:55.760 --> 17:57.680
– you can pass it on…

18:04.160 --> 18:07.640
Give this to that gentleman also he wanted. Ah, you’ve got.

18:07.760 --> 18:09.120
Gentleman : I got it here.

18:09.240 --> 18:12.240
Oh I see. You also take.

18:12.360 --> 18:17.680
Now. So the mantras are according to the chakra that is in problem.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.800
Supposing your Nabhi chakra is not alright. Alright?

18:20.920 --> 18:24.040
And if you start saying the mantra of this one is no use.

18:24.160 --> 18:27.880
So you must know what center is catching, from your fingers.

18:28.000 --> 18:31.480
Now you can make out here, in this chart if you see

18:31.600 --> 18:37.320
on this side, we have got written the numbers according to the centers.

18:37.440 --> 18:40.720
On this side, if you see it clearly?

18:40.840 --> 18:43.720
Now these are the numbers of the centers, alright?

18:43.840 --> 18:47.200
So then, and also here it is written in this chart,

18:47.320 --> 18:50.520
what are the different deities.

18:50.640 --> 18:53.760
Now, all these deities should be first understood,

18:53.880 --> 18:56.560
where are they, and when you have to say the mantras,

18:56.680 --> 19:02.560
what you have to do is coil it into a proper Sahaja Yoga mantra

19:02.680 --> 19:04.080
– so have you given that?

19:04.200 --> 19:05.680
[Yogi] It’s not in these books..

19:05.800 --> 19:07.000
But they will tell you.

19:07.120 --> 19:11.480
The pattern has to be like this, which says,

19:11.600 --> 19:15.480
whatever is the thing is, is woven into the complete

19:15.600 --> 19:18.720
- I mean you are to be recommended, isn’t it? Somebody has to say.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.000
So you have to say that

19:21.120 --> 19:25.800
I am the one who has given you this knowledge.

19:25.920 --> 19:28.440
So just you have to use that particular thing

19:28.560 --> 19:31.280
which they will give you, the pattern, which is very simple.

19:31.400 --> 19:38.800
And you have to use these names of these deities, different deities

19:38.920 --> 19:42.880
according, and gradually you’ll be amazed it will work out.

19:43.000 --> 19:46.160
But when you come here, they will tell you, it’s very simple,

19:46.280 --> 19:49.880
it’s very simple. But you must know where the chakras are.

19:50.000 --> 19:52.400
First of all, you must become sensitive.

19:52.520 --> 19:56.320
So I would suggest that you must start using olive oil

19:56.440 --> 19:59.800
for your fingers and for your toes, you see,

19:59.920 --> 20:03.120
rub it nicely, make your fingers sensitive.

20:03.240 --> 20:07.280
Because of various things, our hands have become gross, you see.

20:07.400 --> 20:12.000
To feel it better, use some nice olive oil, massage it nicely.

20:12.120 --> 20:14.480
And sometimes, if you wear the gloves in the night,

20:14.600 --> 20:18.440
they can soften it also. You must soften, soft hands are better.

20:18.560 --> 20:21.440
And the nails should not be very long, not very badly cut,

20:21.560 --> 20:25.080
sort of things you see, and they are to be properly done.

20:25.240 --> 20:28.320
So that when you use on others, they should not feel hurt

20:28.440 --> 20:31.040
with your nails. But for yourself also,

20:31.160 --> 20:33.160
you should not have very –right hand specially –

20:33.280 --> 20:35.040
because you’ll have to use it like this here,

20:35.160 --> 20:36.800
say, you have a Vishudhi chakra,

20:36.920 --> 20:39.480
then you’ll have to use your Nabhi chakra like that

20:39.600 --> 20:42.920
So what, actually, is the matter with you,

20:43.040 --> 20:47.200
is to be first heard. So first you have to understand yourself,

20:47.320 --> 20:52.120
what is your problem, what you are suffering from,

20:52.240 --> 20:54.200
and then, how to correct.

20:54.320 --> 20:59.080
If you could find out how to correct it and what is your problem,

20:59.200 --> 21:05.480
then it is the easiest thing, is to coil a mantra to improve yourself.

21:05.600 --> 21:07.560
Alright? It’s very simple.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.840
Now you have met me only a day back, I should say,

21:11.960 --> 21:13.800
but you’ll be amazed the knowledge

21:13.920 --> 21:16.880
that you will have now about yourself, will be tremendous.

21:17.000 --> 21:20.280
So first is SelfRealization, means you know yourself.

21:20.400 --> 21:23.240
Once you know yourself, you start knowing others,

21:23.360 --> 21:25.840
because we are all collectively conscious.

21:25.960 --> 21:29.360
Those who are Realized souls become aware of others.

21:29.480 --> 21:32.560
So first of all, if you want to see your own vibrations,

21:32.680 --> 21:35.280
you have to put yourself into bandhan like this,

21:35.400 --> 21:37.040
as I told you, like this.

21:37.160 --> 21:38.720
Now, let’s do it.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.640
Put your left hand towards me.

21:42.800 --> 21:46.560
[Yogi] Like this towards Shri Mataji…

22:01.680 --> 22:06.000
Now, these are your vibrations, whatever it is, now check,

22:06.120 --> 22:10.320
see now. Which finger is burning? See, carefully.

22:12.000 --> 22:18.600
Now this is left Nabbhi. Now which one is burning, be careful.

22:18.720 --> 22:20.440
Pay attention.

22:23.720 --> 22:25.320
Which one?

22:28.440 --> 22:30.040
[Newcomer] [Inaudible]….

22:32.160 --> 22:34.160
Which one?

22:41.400 --> 22:46.320
May be he is constipated, is he? Does he get constipation?

22:47.680 --> 22:55.280
Yes, it’s the liver, sign of liver, you see and also constipated.

22:55.400 --> 22:57.520
So he is more a right sided person,

22:57.640 --> 22:59.280
because right side is this thing.

22:59.400 --> 23:03.600
So he has to put left to the right, like this. Alright?

23:03.720 --> 23:06.800
[Newcomer] I’m just warm [?] and [?]..what could that mean?

23:06.920 --> 23:08.280
You have a heart [problem]

23:08.400 --> 23:09.760
[Newcomer] It’s allergy [?]

23:09.880 --> 23:13.480
You put your right hand on your heart.

23:13.600 --> 23:16.480
New Sahaja Yogini : [Inaudible]…. Rather warm.

23:16.600 --> 23:20.320
Warm? Alright, doesn’t matter, and the other one?

23:20.440 --> 23:27.080
Nothing. Alright. So put your left to the right. Left to the right.

23:27.200 --> 23:29.360
[Yogi] You take it- when She says left to the right,

23:29.480 --> 23:31.080
what you’re doing is not just this one,

23:31.200 --> 23:33.200
put you are actually lifting the left side

23:33.320 --> 23:35.720
And taking the grace from the right.

23:36.480 --> 23:38.520
[Yogi] … because you’re balancing

23:38.640 --> 23:41.240
And taking the grace, you see, on the right side,

23:41.360 --> 23:43.520
because right side is showing nothing.

23:43.640 --> 23:45.200
If the right side is showing nothing,

23:45.320 --> 23:47.400
then what you are doing, you are lifting your left

23:47.520 --> 23:50.920
which is slightly showing and you take up and bring it down,

23:51.040 --> 23:54.160
with your right hand. Left to the right.

23:55.160 --> 23:59.280
[Yogi] If you got problems on the right side,

24:02.000 --> 24:04.840
you take from the left side, and over the top

24:04.960 --> 24:09.640
and bring down the grace into the right side….

24:10.080 --> 24:13.200
Then it’s the opposite, it’s as simple as that.

24:13.320 --> 24:16.240
If she’s not- if you are not feeling at all on right hand,

24:16.360 --> 24:18.800
then you have right hand problem.

24:18.960 --> 24:22.320
You’re not feeling any vibrations, hum?

24:22.920 --> 24:25.200
And left hand, you are feeling what?

24:25.320 --> 24:28.360
[Yogi] Slightly warm on the left side….

24:36.320 --> 24:41.160
So she has to go from right to left.

24:43.120 --> 24:45.280
Just do it yourself now, get into balance

24:45.400 --> 24:48.080
that’s the object of what Shri Mataji is saying.

24:48.200 --> 24:49.720
[Yogini] Can we change hands?

24:49.840 --> 24:53.360
Yes you can, you change hands.

24:57.120 --> 25:00.760
[Yogi] Just to repeat it again, if you have abnormal sensations,

25:00.880 --> 25:04.400
heat or something in your right hand, that means there is a damage

25:04.520 --> 25:07.600
on that side, so you lift the left side

25:07.720 --> 25:11.360
and you bring down the grace inti the right side.

25:11.480 --> 25:14.400
Just do that if you got that problem.

25:14.520 --> 25:15.960
Right to the left.

25:16.080 --> 25:18.600
You take your right hand and put it like that.

25:18.720 --> 25:22.080
[Yogi] If you got it in the other direction, you change hand as She said,

25:22.200 --> 25:24.680
and you go the other way. It’s as simple as that.

25:24.800 --> 25:29.880
Until it balances, until it works ou t. Keep doing until it works out.

25:30.000 --> 25:32.480
Did you come to my program before?

25:32.600 --> 25:33.000
No

25:33.120 --> 25:35.200
That’s why. Just it has started, you see,

25:35.320 --> 25:37.600
you have to get your Realization first of all, alright?

25:37.760 --> 25:40.240
You come here. We’ll have to work it out, first of all,

25:40.360 --> 25:43.760
as your Realization has not worked out, that’s why. It just started.

25:43.880 --> 25:47.600
Hum? Let it work out. If the Realization works out,

25:47.720 --> 25:51.280
then only you can feel it properly. That’s why.

25:51.400 --> 25:56.040
Right side, not at all, so I was wondering why. Are you feeling ?

25:56.480 --> 25:59.560
Good. Left hand what are you feeling?

25:59.680 --> 26:04.840
Cool breeze, in the left hand and not on the right. Alright.

26:04.960 --> 26:08.160
So what you do is to take left to the right

26:08.280 --> 26:11.640
No, with the right hand.

26:11.760 --> 26:13.240
[New Yogini] Oh, yes.

26:13.680 --> 26:19.560
Gradually when you practice you will know. Better now? Good?

26:19.880 --> 26:21.360
Good! He’s alright.

26:21.480 --> 26:24.320
Are you alright? How are you feeling?

26:41.200 --> 26:44.760
[Yogi] She’s asking you get heat on the left side or the left hand?

26:44.880 --> 26:49.720
You can get it on left hand or left side, anywhere. Where are you getting?

26:55.200 --> 27:00.080
Yes, you can get it on both the sides. Are you getting on right?

27:00.200 --> 27:03.880
Then you put your left to the right.

27:04.720 --> 27:09.640
No, no, no, left hand towards Me, and right hand like this,

27:11.280 --> 27:16.360
Just raise it and bring it down like this. Don’t go back.

27:44.920 --> 27:46.920
Both the hands cool?

27:54.280 --> 27:56.920
Look at Me. Left hand to Me, like this

27:57.040 --> 28:00.640
and right hand you pick it up, come here and push it down.

28:04.920 --> 28:07.240
She’s alright. You're alright.

28:07.360 --> 28:11.200
What about you? Feeling cool breeze in both the hands?

28:16.720 --> 28:21.800
The balance, yes. You start feeling the balance. That’s the best way.

28:24.400 --> 28:26.480
You have a Vishuddhi that way. Doesn’t matter.

28:26.600 --> 28:31.920
You put your left hand at the back of your chakra, here.

28:34.880 --> 28:38.320
And put your right hand towards Me. Right hand.

28:38.960 --> 28:40.760
What about you? Are you feeling?

28:40.880 --> 28:44.640
Nothing? You never felt any cool breeze? Surprising.

28:44.760 --> 28:50.920
You come from which state? UP!

28:52.680 --> 28:56.320
[Hindi conversation]

31:40.480 --> 31:44.320
New Sahaja Yogini : How long does that type of things ..?

31:44.440 --> 31:46.480
Split of a second.

31:46.600 --> 31:49.640
New Sahaja Yogini : How long will it last, balancing yourself?

31:49.760 --> 31:52.040
[Yogi] How long will the balancing last you?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.440
Last? I mean there is no timing for it.

31:54.560 --> 31:57.400
It can last you for ever, but if you are a very wobbly type,

31:57.520 --> 32:01.080
it may a little bit drop on, but you have to know how to do it, you see?

32:01.200 --> 32:03.520
Now, we can say we are driving a car.

32:03.640 --> 32:05.400
Now, how long will it last there?

32:05.520 --> 32:07.760
As long as you keep it.

32:08.200 --> 32:11.160
You are driving this car, alright?

32:11.280 --> 32:13.760
Now, what is it? Are you feeling the balance now?

32:13.880 --> 32:14.800
[New Yogini] I? Yes.

32:14.920 --> 32:16.040
Good, then it’s good.

32:16.160 --> 32:18.560
[Yogi] When it becomes imbalanced, that’s when you correct it.

32:18.680 --> 32:21.040
[New Yogini] So, just trough the day, you just have to

32:21.160 --> 32:23.600
No, no, no, no, no, no. Now, if you’re in balance,

32:23.720 --> 32:29.480
there is nothing wrong, it’s alright, perfectly alright.

32:38.120 --> 32:41.840
[Yogi] Can you get it when you haven’t had the Realization. You mean the balancing?

32:41.960 --> 32:45.960
Have you got your Realization?

32:46.080 --> 32:48.400
That is the first, that’s the first thing.

32:48.520 --> 32:51.960
Otherwise you have not entered into the kingdom of God, isn’t it?

32:52.080 --> 32:54.840
First thing is to have your Realization and then, now,

32:54.960 --> 32:58.280
put your hands towards me.

32:58.680 --> 33:00.560
[Yogi] Everybody should do that because

33:00.680 --> 33:02.600
the more you put your hands to Mother,

33:02.720 --> 33:05.480
the stronger the vibrations will flow.

33:07.080 --> 33:10.000
Take this chance because it has to develop.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.800
It might be a little uncomfortable, but just keep your hands to Mother.

33:16.880 --> 33:20.920
You got the cool breeze in your hands, are you feeling?

33:22.080 --> 33:25.680
Start, close your eyes.

33:25.800 --> 33:28.920
What about you? No.

33:29.040 --> 33:33.840
[Yogi] Those who haven’t their Realization, put their hands up please.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.160
You come forward. I think best is

33:37.240 --> 33:41.400
- and the rest of the people and Sahaja Yogis can see. Come along.

33:46.240 --> 33:49.360
Now these people can be taught by Sahaja Yogis how to give Realization,

33:49.480 --> 33:53.200
you are alright, three of you, go ahead. [People move]

34:00.440 --> 34:04.320
And the Sahaja Yogis can meet them and talk to them.

34:04.760 --> 34:06.240
Sit down, sit down.

34:25.600 --> 34:28.480
Just like this. Put your hand.

34:50.680 --> 34:57.960
Are you feeling? Do like that with your eyes, do a little bit.

34:58.080 --> 35:04.320
Just press them, press your eyes hard, very hard- thrice.

35:04.480 --> 35:07.200
Hard, press them hard, thrice.

35:12.440 --> 35:13.960
Alright?

35:14.080 --> 35:20.040
Not yet? It will come. It will work out.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.400
Watch me, watch me here.

35:27.520 --> 35:35.000
[Shri Mataji still holds a candle in front of Her face,

35:35.120 --> 35:39.560
then in front of her right hand

35:39.680 --> 35:43.280
and the new people are sent to another room

35:43.400 --> 35:47.480
where Sahaja Yogis will work on them.]

38:53.000 --> 38:56.000
Please take the baby out a little bit, because everybody tries to meditate.

38:56.160 --> 38:58.280
Alright, just for a minute

39:07.040 --> 39:10.360
Don’t feel guilty, none of you should feel guilty.

39:10.480 --> 39:13.680
Everybody has certain problems still. You just go and say:

39:13.800 --> 39:18.880
Mother I am not guilty. Close your eyes, just close your eyes.

39:19.760 --> 39:23.880
There is nothing to feel guilty about anything whatsoever.

39:24.000 --> 39:27.520
Whatever you have done is finished now.

39:27.640 --> 39:33.320
You are entering into new awareness now. Into the kingdom of God.

39:33.760 --> 39:38.320
Now you have become the spirit, and spirit cannot be guilty.

40:08.120 --> 40:11.960
Forget about the people who have not come today with you. Anyone.

40:12.080 --> 40:15.280
Just forget them. Just start to be yourself.

40:15.480 --> 40:20.360
They can come later on and you can give them the full advantage.

40:53.720 --> 40:57.240
Those who have got liver problem should take sugar

40:57.360 --> 40:59.440
and they’ll tell you what is to be done.

40:59.560 --> 41:06.640
If you have diabetes you can take salt.

41:07.440 --> 41:10.600
And for other people who have arthritis and all that also,

41:10.720 --> 41:13.920
I’ll ask you to bring some petrol or kerosene on,

41:14.040 --> 41:17.680
if not you can come back again and take it from these.

41:17.800 --> 41:20.400
Thank you very much. Enjoy your life.

41:20.520 --> 41:23.000
May God bless you!
