00:00:00.222 --> 00:00:09.547
It is such a great pleasure to see you all
assembled here,

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:20.615
and which is such a far-fetched place, away
from the madding crowd.

00:00:21.379 --> 00:00:29.257
It's such a beautiful place, and which has
vibrations.

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:35.134
They can't hear you.

00:00:36.346 --> 00:00:42.275
Now can you hear Me? All right.

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:47.727
It's all right now.

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:54.474
I selected this place suddenly

00:00:54.675 --> 00:01:01.322
from a very thick newspaper, American
newspaper.

00:01:01.522 --> 00:01:05.424
The vibrations were just shooting out

00:01:05.624 --> 00:01:09.152
and I said, "What is this, coming from
where?"

00:01:09.353 --> 00:01:12.590
And there was a little advertisement,

00:01:12.791 --> 00:01:18.142
and I said, "This is the place where we
have to go."

00:01:18.343 --> 00:01:25.891
This place has so many vibrations, even
in the advertisement."

00:01:26.335 --> 00:01:32.687
So you can imagine how the guidance comes.

00:01:32.887 --> 00:01:40.535
It comes from vibrations, and that's how
I was here

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:48.281
and this place was selected by the divine
Force,

00:01:48.481 --> 00:01:52.408
and it happened only in one day.

00:01:52.608 --> 00:01:57.294
Such a miraculous thing to happen in one
day!

00:01:58.398 --> 00:02:04.560
It was taking so much time for them even
to get this,

00:02:04.761 --> 00:02:09.698
and suddenly I told them, "Better get it."

00:02:10.473 --> 00:02:20.180
It all worked out, and we are now here
in the most beautiful atmosphere.

00:02:23.322 --> 00:02:30.253
Of course, you know that Red Indians were
driven out

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:39.042
and they came here to hide themselves. They
were hiding themselves in this place

00:02:39.242 --> 00:02:48.655
so that they should not be crushed and
destroyed forever.

00:02:49.512 --> 00:02:56.487
That era is over now, that era
of domination,

00:02:56.687 --> 00:03:02.770
of entering into somebody else's land and
occupying it,

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:07.125
and considering it to be a great revelry,

00:03:07.326 --> 00:03:13.870
all that is over now, the human
understanding has gone much beyond;

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.931
and they understand that this is sinful,
this is wrong,

00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:24.496
whatever we have done was wrong.

00:03:24.696 --> 00:03:27.856
But those people are no more.

00:03:28.056 --> 00:03:33.542
And the children and the grandchildren
of those children

00:03:33.743 --> 00:03:38.890
of these people who were the children
of God, they used to think,

00:03:39.091 --> 00:03:42.539
do not like all that;

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:49.648
because you have no right

00:03:49.848 --> 00:03:57.834
to take somebody's land like that and
occupy it as your own.

00:03:58.546 --> 00:04:02.108
Of course, the land doesn't belong
to anyone,

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:08.756
but still wherever you are born, that's
your land,

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:17.905
and that land has to be kept with those
who are born here, who own it.

00:04:18.105 --> 00:04:24.705
But this kind of aggression has been going
on for ages now.

00:04:24.905 --> 00:04:29.486
Now the time has come to finish this,

00:04:29.692 --> 00:04:34.636
once for all give up this kind
of adventure,

00:04:34.844 --> 00:04:43.159
is to enter into somebody's land or
somebody's house and occupy it.

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.930
But there's another kind of aggression
I see now,

00:04:47.131 --> 00:04:52.480
is that they enter into the minds
of the people now

00:04:52.681 --> 00:05:02.186
through their talk, through their all kinds
of aggressive attitude,

00:05:02.458 --> 00:05:07.557
and the mind, mind itself becomes a slave.

00:05:07.757 --> 00:05:16.019
The present times are like that, I think,
where people have no freedom

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:23.936
to think what is right, what is wrong, and
also to take to right things.

00:05:24.137 --> 00:05:30.408
They have to accept whatever is happening
around,

00:05:30.932 --> 00:05:37.554
whatever is immoral, whatever is
destructive.

00:05:37.755 --> 00:05:44.274
One has to accept because still, I think,

00:05:44.475 --> 00:05:48.475
we do not have sufficient number of Sahaja
yogis

00:05:48.675 --> 00:05:58.411
who can oppose all these adventures
of modern times.

00:05:58.611 --> 00:06:02.575
We have another kind where we find

00:06:02.775 --> 00:06:10.977
these false gurus who aggress - specially
America.

00:06:11.636 --> 00:06:18.163
America is really cursed that way because
it had money,

00:06:18.363 --> 00:06:23.542
so all the crooks of the world came here -
just imagine.

00:06:23.742 --> 00:06:27.200
To have money itself is not a blessing.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:33.020
They all came here and looted rich people

00:06:33.296 --> 00:06:37.792
and have made so much money for themself.

00:06:40.097 --> 00:06:44.170
This kind of exploitation

00:06:44.371 --> 00:06:50.127
is very much dangerous, much more,

00:06:50.328 --> 00:06:55.869
because the mind gets ruined. I have seen
many people were ruined,

00:06:56.070 --> 00:07:02.019
specially many seekers were ruined
completely.

00:07:03.715 --> 00:07:10.056
I hope they are born again and get their
Self-realization.

00:07:10.256 --> 00:07:13.311
The seeking is there, no doubt,

00:07:13.511 --> 00:07:20.001
but all kinds of obstacles have come,
all kinds of temptations are there.

00:07:20.202 --> 00:07:30.582
And so, despite all that seeking, earnest
seeking, honest seeking,

00:07:30.782 --> 00:07:37.022
they have fallen into traps, which I cannot
explain

00:07:37.223 --> 00:07:43.071
why should it have happened, but it has
happened - one has to see.

00:07:43.272 --> 00:07:50.156
It's a - makes you very miserable, unhappy.

00:07:51.184 --> 00:07:56.927
But still so many are there, you are there,
saved now.

00:07:57.127 --> 00:08:04.039
And in this Last Judgment you have risen
from that level

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.433
to this new level, where I am sure

00:08:08.633 --> 00:08:14.195
you will be able to salvage many more.

00:08:14.396 --> 00:08:20.893
Each person can salvage at least thousand
people, and so many of you,

00:08:21.094 --> 00:08:27.835
if you try that, it would be of a very,
very great,

00:08:28.035 --> 00:08:36.881
very great emancipation for this world
which we are all to save.

00:08:37.082 --> 00:08:46.630
So one must know the first, first duty
of every Sahaja yogi now

00:08:46.831 --> 00:08:52.727
is to save others, to talk about Sahaja
Yoga,

00:08:52.928 --> 00:09:00.945
to work out Sahaja Yoga in different
places.

00:09:01.146 --> 00:09:05.522
For example now, I was surprised that they
are working out

00:09:05.722 --> 00:09:13.599
on children who are abused. They are also
in India, we are working out

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:19.454
on various places like prisons, armies.

00:09:19.655 --> 00:09:24.309
So you can enter into all kinds
of activities,

00:09:24.509 --> 00:09:35.960
you can enter into all kinds of aggressed
places and save people.

00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:42.468
But worst of all, I think, is the innocence
is under attack

00:09:42.668 --> 00:09:46.097
in these Western countries, specially
in America.

00:09:46.298 --> 00:09:54.072
The innocence is under attack and this is
something is very dangerous,

00:09:54.272 --> 00:10:04.011
because the children get this mutation
at a very young age,

00:10:04.212 --> 00:10:07.454
and what will happen to them?

00:10:07.645 --> 00:10:14.300
So we have to think of all those innocent
children,

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.563
what we can do for them, how we can save
them,

00:10:20.763 --> 00:10:23.676
how we can work it out.

00:10:23.877 --> 00:10:29.344
The concern has to now go from yourself
to others.

00:10:29.544 --> 00:10:34.678
You got your realization alright; you
corrected yourself,

00:10:34.878 --> 00:10:41.949
you are absolutely perfecting yourself;
all this is there,

00:10:42.149 --> 00:10:46.889
but now what is to be done?

00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:54.436
For what is this light enlightened here?
It is for others.

00:10:54.636 --> 00:11:01.095
So now Sahaja yogis have to live for others,
and not for themselves.

00:11:01.295 --> 00:11:05.131
They'll have all the energy, they'll have
all the support

00:11:05.308 --> 00:11:10.306
and they'll have all the blessings. So we
have to live for others.

00:11:10.507 --> 00:11:15.297
And how do we live for others - is very
simple,

00:11:15.497 --> 00:11:20.695
is to have concern, concern about
everything.

00:11:20.896 --> 00:11:27.112
You have concern about the Mother
Earth, concern about your neighbors,

00:11:27.313 --> 00:11:34.541
concern about the people who's suffering
all over the world.

00:11:34.741 --> 00:11:40.604
If you read the newspaper you will be
amazed how

00:11:40.804 --> 00:11:46.366
things are happening, how people are
suffering.

00:11:46.567 --> 00:11:49.528
We have to understand fundamentally

00:11:49.728 --> 00:11:53.837
that unless and until transformation takes
place,

00:11:54.037 --> 00:11:59.561
we cannot change this world. And you all
can transform others,

00:11:59.761 --> 00:12:05.349
so it's your duty, it's your job
to transform other people

00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:11.096
and tell them what is divine love.

00:12:11.296 --> 00:12:15.617
Love is the only way now we can work out.

00:12:15.818 --> 00:12:24.441
It is something like a big, big hole which
should go into this darkness of aggression,

00:12:24.642 --> 00:12:32.380
and which will clarify many places, many
hearts, many people.

00:12:32.580 --> 00:12:43.479
It is a ocean, we should say, ocean
of greatness.

00:12:43.679 --> 00:12:49.463
This divine love is so great

00:12:49.663 --> 00:12:57.854
and so powerful, at the same time so very
gentle

00:12:58.054 --> 00:13:03.557
that you can see the nature, how, how
the trees grow:

00:13:03.757 --> 00:13:12.995
every leaf gets the sunshine, every tree
has its own position.

00:13:13.195 --> 00:13:16.417
We have to learn so much from the nature,

00:13:16.618 --> 00:13:22.506
because nature is bound with that love.

00:13:22.919 --> 00:13:28.358
Nature has no aggressiveness.

00:13:28.558 --> 00:13:35.910
It is just under the complete control
of the divine love.

00:13:36.111 --> 00:13:41.714
With this understanding you should also
know

00:13:41.915 --> 00:13:47.985
that when you are getting to Sahaja yogis

00:13:48.185 --> 00:13:53.849
what should be your attitude: how you
should move,

00:13:54.050 --> 00:13:59.463
how you should talk to them, how you should
understand them,

00:13:59.663 --> 00:14:03.043
how you should express your love.

00:14:03.243 --> 00:14:11.020
This is quite possible now, it's not
difficult.

00:14:11.221 --> 00:14:16.008
You should not be afraid, not feel shy.

00:14:16.208 --> 00:14:24.899
But in a sweet manner you can talk to them,

00:14:25.100 --> 00:14:31.035
you can communicate with them, you can
tell them;

00:14:31.626 --> 00:14:39.896
because this was the time, this was
to happen,

00:14:40.097 --> 00:14:43.774
that's the reason Adi Shakti had to come.

00:14:43.975 --> 00:14:48.100
Without Her, it would not have been
possible.

00:14:48.301 --> 00:14:52.767
All other incarnations were there,

00:14:52.967 --> 00:14:57.406
but firstly, they were only on one chakras,

00:14:57.606 --> 00:15:01.350
and another one was they had to establish
themselves

00:15:01.550 --> 00:15:05.948
with other people, with the people around.

00:15:06.148 --> 00:15:09.317
They did try and they worked it out,

00:15:09.517 --> 00:15:15.471
but it didn't really work in the real sense
of the word.

00:15:15.672 --> 00:15:23.257
So Adi Shakti had to come, who has all
of them with Her.

00:15:23.457 --> 00:15:30.333
They're all with us, all the time wanting
to help you

00:15:30.533 --> 00:15:39.353
to do everything that you want to achieve.
It is there with -

00:15:39.553 --> 00:15:48.566
these holy vibrations are with you

00:15:48.766 --> 00:15:53.410
for every kind of good work you want to do,

00:15:53.611 --> 00:15:57.617
any kind of Sahaj work you want to do,

00:15:57.818 --> 00:16:03.779
these vibrations will definitely be there
to guide you,

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:11.992
to help you, to support you and to love
you. You will be amazed how

00:16:12.192 --> 00:16:16.590
people, once they start working for Sahaja
Yoga,

00:16:16.791 --> 00:16:21.657
how they are blessed from every angle.

00:16:23.591 --> 00:16:30.572
So, one has to decide in their own minds

00:16:30.773 --> 00:16:38.476
that all your dreams have to come true.

00:16:38.676 --> 00:16:45.284
So only thing what you have to do is
to know only that

00:16:45.485 --> 00:16:53.786
your purpose of life is to spread Sahaja
Yoga.

00:16:54.722 --> 00:16:58.109
Even now many Sahaja yogis write to Me,

00:16:58.310 --> 00:17:00.757
"Mother, this is happening to me, that is
happening,

00:17:00.957 --> 00:17:07.534
my father like that, mother like that" -
but very few.

00:17:07.734 --> 00:17:11.751
Practically this is over now.

00:17:12.226 --> 00:17:19.141
They used to write, I should say, all such
letters,

00:17:19.341 --> 00:17:24.840
but now I think they are all been perfected,
I don't know what has happened.

00:17:25.041 --> 00:17:34.645
It's a very unique time where there's light
everywhere,

00:17:37.297 --> 00:17:45.895
the nature is absolutely with you. You can
see how nature acts,

00:17:46.096 --> 00:17:50.191
how it is trying to help you and support
you,

00:17:50.392 --> 00:17:54.612
and how it wants to work out everything
for you.

00:17:54.812 --> 00:18:02.027
It is to be just understood and felt

00:18:02.623 --> 00:18:12.092
that you are something very special, and
that you have all the help,

00:18:12.292 --> 00:18:19.712
everyone of you. It's not one person,
two persons,

00:18:19.912 --> 00:18:27.235
it's not ten persons who - it's the whole
lot, as if the whole ocean

00:18:27.436 --> 00:18:36.932
is there to help you, help you to swim over
to save so many.

00:18:37.132 --> 00:18:45.748
You haven't seen such an ocean where there
is so much depth,

00:18:45.949 --> 00:18:51.291
and all the waves try to save you,

00:18:51.491 --> 00:19:01.001
to make you float in the realm of joy.

00:19:01.779 --> 00:19:09.181
All this has happened to you because there
is a purpose.

00:19:09.382 --> 00:19:14.294
It's not just because you have done poorva
punyas and all that.

00:19:14.495 --> 00:19:20.826
Many people say, "Because of previous life
we have got it".

00:19:22.791 --> 00:19:26.584
That is true. The cause may be that,

00:19:26.785 --> 00:19:34.034
but the result is that now you are capable
of giving realization to people,

00:19:34.234 --> 00:19:36.840
and this is what you have to do.

00:19:37.040 --> 00:19:43.169
All the way you have come here in this
wilderness.

00:19:44.088 --> 00:19:50.202
From this wilderness only, you will rise

00:19:50.403 --> 00:19:54.840
and you will bless all the people
of the world.

00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:59.198
Specially America should be blessed again
and again,

00:19:59.398 --> 00:20:11.743
because it's the Virat, it is Shri
Krishna's land,

00:20:12.172 --> 00:20:20.210
because people will always try to follow,
to copy you.

00:20:20.756 --> 00:20:26.005
Things will improve

00:20:26.894 --> 00:20:35.676
if you get the, we can say the blessings

00:20:35.877 --> 00:20:41.334
of the various lotuses you have within
yourself, no doubt.

00:20:41.534 --> 00:20:47.331
But what about you doing something,

00:20:48.244 --> 00:20:56.192
what about you doing something about it?
And this is what is very important.

00:20:56.393 --> 00:21:01.811
Now only thing what you have to do about
yourself

00:21:02.190 --> 00:21:12.209
is to find out about your own activities,

00:21:12.454 --> 00:21:16.311
what activities you have been doing.

00:21:16.484 --> 00:21:23.838
You have to find out what have you done,
and what you can do.

00:21:24.038 --> 00:21:32.002
When you meditate you think about yourself,
how much you have grown,

00:21:32.203 --> 00:21:38.044
what have you done, what have you given
to others.

00:21:38.244 --> 00:21:43.369
Whatever you've got, unless and until you
distribute it, it won't increase.

00:21:43.569 --> 00:21:48.885
That is the fundamental law, and that
works. I've seen people

00:21:49.085 --> 00:21:55.188
who are realized souls, who are very good,

00:21:55.388 --> 00:21:58.476
who know everything about Sahaja Yog

00:21:58.677 --> 00:22:08.169
but are not yet that much confident,
I should say, or that much deep.

00:22:08.370 --> 00:22:15.738
All this is only possible if you yourself

00:22:15.939 --> 00:22:23.986
get into creating new Sahaja yogis,

00:22:25.192 --> 00:22:29.942
and more Sahaja yogis - not for popularity,

00:22:30.143 --> 00:22:36.444
but for their good and for the good
of the whole.

00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:42.860
I was asked that I should come and stay
in America

00:22:43.061 --> 00:22:48.821
so America will improve very much. So now
here I am.

00:22:49.021 --> 00:22:52.193
I came here, I stayed here,

00:22:52.393 --> 00:22:59.892
and I am definitely putting all My
attention,

00:23:00.092 --> 00:23:07.589
because it's a very important, very, very
important chakra

00:23:07.790 --> 00:23:14.829
which is this, which is America.

00:23:15.072 --> 00:23:28.688
And this very important country is doing
sometimes very stupid things.

00:23:28.889 --> 00:23:32.792
I would not say that you enter into
politics - no.

00:23:32.993 --> 00:23:38.610
I would not say you get into any opposition
and form a group - no.

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:42.744
But you also know that you have powers.

00:23:42.944 --> 00:23:48.670
Even your thought, your desire has powers.

00:23:48.870 --> 00:23:55.107
Try to experiment with it. Once you
experiment, you will find out

00:23:55.307 --> 00:24:01.460
that only the attention that you put
to these things, it will work out,

00:24:01.745 --> 00:24:05.495
I am sure it will work out.

00:24:07.015 --> 00:24:14.476
It is a country which can definitely help

00:24:15.856 --> 00:24:20.249
for the emancipation of the whole human
beings.

00:24:20.449 --> 00:24:26.280
But on the contrary, it is going
on the other way round.

00:24:26.978 --> 00:24:30.202
I mean, American culture, I don't
understand at all

00:24:30.403 --> 00:24:38.593
what is American culture is. Is something -

00:24:39.371 --> 00:24:43.693
they say something, do something else.

00:24:44.328 --> 00:24:53.687
They've no proper value system which is
accepted by everyone,

00:24:53.887 --> 00:24:58.891
which is built traditionally from days
together.

00:24:59.147 --> 00:25:06.528
The value system is so convoluted,
so twisted

00:25:06.729 --> 00:25:12.940
that it's only a Sahaja yogi by his
nobility, by his greatness

00:25:13.141 --> 00:25:17.356
can disentangle these people.

00:25:18.309 --> 00:25:25.085
They have funny ideas, and those funny
ideas should not

00:25:25.286 --> 00:25:31.579
deter you, should not stop you; for you
know that they are stupid,

00:25:31.779 --> 00:25:41.070
they are destructive and they will destroy
all the, all the good qualities.

00:25:41.618 --> 00:25:47.671
You should know that the responsibility
of Americans

00:25:47.872 --> 00:25:54.254
is much greater than the responsibility
of any other Sahaja yogis,

00:25:54.455 --> 00:26:01.724
because they are accepted and regarded

00:26:03.106 --> 00:26:19.395
as the most competent people, as the most
effective people by the divine Power.

00:26:19.596 --> 00:26:26.826
Divine Power thinks that now you can go
all ahead,

00:26:27.027 --> 00:26:31.357
you can do so much, and let us see.

00:26:31.557 --> 00:26:36.467
Like we have the power and the machinery,

00:26:36.668 --> 00:26:44.285
but the machinery if it doesn't work, what's
the use of the power? It is useless.

00:26:44.486 --> 00:26:51.784
So the machinery has to work, and it is
working, it is spreading,

00:26:51.985 --> 00:26:55.730
but we have to double our efforts.

00:26:55.930 --> 00:27:00.842
I was thinking of doing some sort
of a social work here

00:27:01.043 --> 00:27:07.220
so that it will go, it will be caught
in the eyes of many people.

00:27:08.633 --> 00:27:13.286
On a subtler level we have worked,

00:27:36.249 --> 00:27:42.731
but now we have to work it on the surface.

00:27:42.931 --> 00:27:52.097
Subtler level we are there, we have
achieved and we can achieve much more.

00:27:52.298 --> 00:28:00.030
But we should come out of it and think
what can we do on the surface,

00:28:00.231 --> 00:28:08.393
so that people see what is Sahaja Yoga is,
and what it can do to people.

00:28:09.405 --> 00:28:18.894
It's your personal behavior, your collective
behavior, your national behavior,

00:28:19.095 --> 00:28:27.643
all are going to change the atmosphere
which is supposed to be superficial,

00:28:27.843 --> 00:28:32.057
so that that also becomes subtler.

00:28:32.257 --> 00:28:38.768
I've been saying this in many places, but
at this puja I think it is important to say

00:28:38.969 --> 00:28:42.631
that if you are really facing the Adi
Shakti,

00:28:42.832 --> 00:28:48.321
then you must know your powers are
boundless.

00:28:49.905 --> 00:28:55.457
You have to just assert those powers.

00:28:55.761 --> 00:29:01.653
It is not a stationary power. It’s, there's
a movement in it,

00:29:01.853 --> 00:29:05.287
and there's a right type of a movement.

00:29:05.487 --> 00:29:10.074
It knows where to enter, how to work it
out. Now look at this place.

00:29:10.274 --> 00:29:15.808
Can you imagine Me thinking about a place
like this?

00:29:16.009 --> 00:29:19.746
But I was just had in mind of course,
I must say,

00:29:19.946 --> 00:29:23.662
that we should have some place here,
because

00:29:23.863 --> 00:29:30.566
the American Sahaja yogis didn't have any
place to meet - that's all.

00:29:30.767 --> 00:29:33.735
And see how I got it!

00:29:33.935 --> 00:29:39.689
But the desire to do all this

00:29:39.889 --> 00:29:46.316
should be there within your subtler level,
and then it works.

00:29:46.517 --> 00:29:50.097
It works, it's like a magic, I tell you.

00:29:50.297 --> 00:29:56.293
Now you have faith in yourself and decide
about it.

00:29:56.494 --> 00:30:04.363
I am so very happy that it has been
achieved

00:30:04.563 --> 00:30:10.875
with such ease - unbelievable, with such
ease.

00:30:11.076 --> 00:30:17.112
Absolutely, nothing great was done.

00:30:17.312 --> 00:30:22.345
The way we got this was so simple,

00:30:22.545 --> 00:30:28.053
that just like another Sahaja yogi
the person was to sell us

00:30:28.254 --> 00:30:35.590
came down so excited, and he just sold it
to us, finished.

00:30:36.138 --> 00:30:41.682
We didn't have to do anything to convince
him

00:30:41.882 --> 00:30:49.146
or to talk to him or reduce the price -
nothing. And he sold it out to us.

00:30:49.347 --> 00:30:54.932
In the same way whatever on a subtler level
you desire,

00:30:55.132 --> 00:31:01.400
it becomes a terrific force which moves
by itself,

00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:12.701
which knows where to go, how to enter, into
which area, and it gets the thing done.

00:31:12.932 --> 00:31:21.991
It's something we all should experience,
and work it out with full confidence.

00:31:22.191 --> 00:31:27.846
It is the love that we have, the concern
we have.

00:31:28.046 --> 00:31:34.621
This is the power that has given us
Self-realization, and this is the power

00:31:34.821 --> 00:31:40.599
that has given us this enrichment
of achievements.

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:45.825
I am sure all of you who are here will
realize

00:31:46.025 --> 00:31:51.088
how it was done - I mean, so quickly.
This is one of the things

00:31:51.288 --> 00:31:59.807
that should just tell you what we are
capable of doing,

00:32:01.145 --> 00:32:04.134
what we are capable of achieving.

00:32:04.335 --> 00:32:13.487
And when you think of so many people who
are lost in the mire of ignorance,

00:32:13.687 --> 00:32:18.486
we should really feel from inside that
concern

00:32:18.687 --> 00:32:28.887
and that hankering, "How can I help these
people?"

00:32:29.212 --> 00:32:33.453
And you'll be amazed, once you think like
that,

00:32:33.654 --> 00:32:37.946
how this divine Power, this Force, will
come in.

00:32:38.146 --> 00:32:46.792
Forget about petty things and petty
problems, they're nothing.

00:32:46.992 --> 00:32:51.287
You have such a powerful thing behind you.

00:32:51.487 --> 00:32:57.159
It's true that all this universe was
created, everything was created

00:32:57.359 --> 00:33:00.452
and then you were created, and all that
is done.

00:33:00.652 --> 00:33:04.998
But the greatest thing this Power has done
is to create

00:33:05.198 --> 00:33:09.310
Sahaja yogis. This is the greatest thing.

00:33:09.510 --> 00:33:17.637
Those who have knowledge, those who have
the pure knowledge

00:33:17.838 --> 00:33:25.424
and those who have the divine love in their
heart,

00:33:25.625 --> 00:33:30.992
what a tremendous personality it is. Just
think of that,

00:33:31.192 --> 00:33:39.645
and you will get all the opportunities
to express that love.

00:33:39.845 --> 00:33:43.203
So may God bless you.
