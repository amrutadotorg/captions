00:17:25.677 --> 00:17:39.082
Very happy to see all of you here. Now I can't
say that you are the seekers but you are the

00:17:39.107 --> 00:17:42.427
ones who have found it.

00:17:42.427 --> 00:17:59.382
It's something so fulfilling. Imagine in the
olden days the custom was, I mean, it was

00:17:59.407 --> 00:18:11.291
so, that one guru could give realisation to
one person, with very great reluctance! First

00:18:11.316 --> 00:18:28.352
they had to go through all kinds of tests,
all kinds of tapasya as they call it, very,

00:18:28.377 --> 00:18:42.022
very strict penance. And out of that they
would select one person to get Self-realisation.

00:18:42.047 --> 00:19:00.072
Imagine what you have got in such a short
time! But, with that long period of ordeal,

00:19:00.097 --> 00:19:17.022
they developed a great sense of respecting
their Self-realisation, of understanding what

00:19:17.047 --> 00:19:32.512
is this. Understanding their own powers, understanding
their own duties. And they were not so many.

00:19:32.537 --> 00:19:43.291
One single person fighting the whole society
with his lofty ideas. While today you are

00:19:43.316 --> 00:19:54.942
so many, all of you are in fraternity, in
love with each other. Nobody is going to torture

00:19:54.967 --> 00:20:08.962
you, nobody is going to take you to task,
but you yourself will feel like spreading

00:20:08.987 --> 00:20:19.791
Sahaja Yoga, giving love and life to people.
It will come spontaneously within you. Like

00:20:19.816 --> 00:20:30.852
a flower which has fragrance, like that you'll
have the fragrance of spirituality and people

00:20:30.877 --> 00:20:37.517
will suddenly recognise you because you are
so different from others.

00:20:37.517 --> 00:20:47.872
Your temperament is so different you are so
balanced you are so sweet and they will come

00:20:47.897 --> 00:21:01.012
around, they will follow you. it has happened
very fast in some countries. Like in India

00:21:01.037 --> 00:21:09.161
they know this, they know Self-realisation
and they know that is the aim of life, so

00:21:09.186 --> 00:21:15.457
it was much easier, it has so many Sahaja
yogis.

00:21:15.457 --> 00:21:27.161
But we have sahaja yogis all over the world
now, even in Greenland, can you imagine, in

00:21:27.186 --> 00:21:42.582
Finland in Sweden, in Norway. We have Israelis
and also Palestinians. They are in Sahaja

00:21:42.607 --> 00:21:52.041
Yoga. Supposed to be fighting but both of
them are in Sahaja Yogi. One Israeli telephoned

00:21:52.066 --> 00:22:00.192
to me that 'Mother, there are some Palestinian
sahaja yogis in a village and we have learnt

00:22:00.217 --> 00:22:07.217
that it is going to be bombed. Can you put
your attention to that?' I was so touched.

00:22:07.242 --> 00:22:17.531
Look at the amount of care and love they have
for the so-called enemies! If this kind of

00:22:17.556 --> 00:22:29.212
love grows one day all this wars and skirmishes
all will be finished, there won't be any fights

00:22:29.237 --> 00:22:45.942
if you realise we are all one, just all, absolutely,
in one Divinity, in one Divine Power. If that

00:22:45.967 --> 00:22:54.141
is built in, then all these problems will
be solved about which I told you in my lecture

00:22:54.166 --> 00:22:57.467
(at Royal Albert Hall a few days before).

00:22:57.467 --> 00:23:06.842
Actually Kundalini has risen in many of you,
most of you. It has pierced also the fontanelle

00:23:06.867 --> 00:23:21.492
bone area, no doubt, but still it comes down
sometimes, comes down to cure you. Supposing

00:23:21.517 --> 00:23:31.332
you are a liver patient, the Kundalini will
come down and put full attention to your liver

00:23:31.357 --> 00:23:42.512
and try to improve your liver. She looks after
you. She is your individual Mother. Everyone

00:23:42.537 --> 00:23:52.432
has that Mother within you. And that Mother
is the one that guides you, looks after you

00:23:52.457 --> 00:24:02.421
and takes you to the right path. And that's
how you'll start your new growth in Sahaja

00:24:02.446 --> 00:24:15.741
yoga. You become a different personality.Then
your attention starts moving away from you

00:24:15.766 --> 00:24:28.792
to others. That's the sign you are fully grown.
If that happens that your attention doesn't

00:24:28.817 --> 00:24:36.952
go to yourself, it goes to others and you
are worried about others.

00:24:36.977 --> 00:24:47.542
It's very surprising, how this love of the
Divine works wonders. I had gone to Russia

00:24:47.567 --> 00:24:57.812
first time, and I was surprised, twenty-five
people from Germany and Austria came there

00:24:57.837 --> 00:25:08.832
on there own, I never called them, organised
their stay and everything. And I said 'Why

00:25:08.857 --> 00:25:18.912
are you here? How are you here? How did you
come? What is the speciality of Russia?' And

00:25:18.977 --> 00:25:29.221
they said, 'Mother, our forefathers had done
so much harm to them so we just couldn't help

00:25:29.246 --> 00:25:39.471
it.' It's a kind of a tremendous love and
understanding about the problems of Russians

00:25:39.496 --> 00:25:48.847
during war. And they were telling me what
all had happened to Russians. I was surprised.

00:25:48.872 --> 00:26:02.511
I asked them 'Who told you?' 'Our father,
our grandfather, who were repenting what they

00:26:02.536 --> 00:26:13.127
have done. But they are no more now so we
thought we had better come and do some service.'

00:26:14.966 --> 00:26:23.195
It's very much touching to me. I have seen
such beautiful side of human beings after

00:26:23.285 --> 00:26:37.145
they have got realisation. No cruelty of any
kind, no unkindness, always forgiveness, such

00:26:37.170 --> 00:26:42.246
a lot of people have become now so sweet.

00:26:42.246 --> 00:26:53.812
In Russia we have, as you know, maximum number
of sahaja yogis, not more than India, but

00:26:53.837 --> 00:27:03.498
yes. So many of them are there in Russia,
and they are so deep, so much understanding.

00:27:03.897 --> 00:27:12.193
They never grudge about their problems of
money or anything. They said 'Mother, we have

00:27:12.217 --> 00:27:20.977
only one problem.' 'What problem you have?'
'Of leadership. Give us a nice leader. And

00:27:21.327 --> 00:27:29.441
now,' they said 'we have a nice leader.' He
has accepted Sahaja Yoga, it's a religion

00:27:29.466 --> 00:27:39.991
in Russia. Of course, it is also a religion
in India. But actually it is accepted as an

00:27:40.016 --> 00:27:51.345
official religion in America. Just imagine!

00:27:51.713 --> 00:27:59.702
We think that Americans are so materialistic
and this and that. They are only 200 year

00:27:59.727 --> 00:28:09.929
old nation and how have they grown so deep
into spirituality, how did they realise this,

00:28:12.747 --> 00:28:20.698
that, spirituality is the essence of life.

00:28:20.723 --> 00:28:35.292
Now I am facing you people who are supposed
to be from England and English had these great

00:28:35.317 --> 00:28:44.162
people right from Shakespeare, William Blake,
all of them were realised souls. But what

00:28:44.187 --> 00:28:59.182
I find in their effort is that they are trying
to show so many things for you to understand

00:28:59.207 --> 00:29:08.652
Sahaja Yoga. But what can they do, because
they didn't know how to raise the Kundalini

00:29:08.677 --> 00:29:17.652
perhaps, or the people were absolutely deaf
and dumb that they didn't understand what

00:29:17.677 --> 00:29:23.797
these people tried to convey.

00:29:23.797 --> 00:29:33.236
Most of the poets were realised souls. Most
of the writers were realised souls. How can

00:29:33.297 --> 00:29:46.132
it be that such great people are just lost?
But now when I see you all here I think of

00:29:46.157 --> 00:30:00.307
them. They must be very happy to see you all
enjoying the bliss, the bliss of the Divine.

00:30:01.109 --> 00:30:11.022
There's no end to the description of these
things. You cannot describe it fully. It is

00:30:11.047 --> 00:30:17.266
to be enjoyed. Only thing is, first stage
is thoughtless awareness, which you have to

00:30:17.266 --> 00:30:31.221
achieve. If you have achieved the thoughtless
awareness then you have crossed one step.

00:30:31.246 --> 00:30:36.957
That is the main thing.

00:30:36.957 --> 00:30:48.932
You have to become thoughtlessly aware. It's
not difficult. There's a sanskrit saying that

00:30:48.957 --> 00:31:01.612
you start saying no to every thought. Whatever
thought comes in -- 'Ya neti neti wachane

00:31:01.637 --> 00:31:08.637
nigamor awachus'. Just go on saying 'No. Not
this thought. Not this thought. Not this thought.'

00:31:08.986 --> 00:31:24.312
And you can achieve it. Also raising Kundalini,
forgiving people, you can achieve it. Also

00:31:24.337 --> 00:31:31.702
if you can find out why these thoughts are
coming to you, what is the source of this

00:31:31.727 --> 00:31:42.302
thought. If you could just see what is the
source then you can do it. Suddenly you will

00:31:42.327 --> 00:31:53.272
find you are silent, you are not thinking
but you are aware, fully aware and aware of

00:31:53.297 --> 00:32:04.832
so many things of which you were never aware.
It's something you have to practice, is to

00:32:04.857 --> 00:32:09.486
become thoughtlessly aware.

00:32:09.486 --> 00:32:20.622
This awareness gives a new dimension to your
attention. You develop an attention that works,

00:32:20.647 --> 00:32:33.102
that works. Sitting down here, if you want
to think about something, this attention will

00:32:33.127 --> 00:32:44.102
go and work out the problem. It works out.
You can also do it. But if your attention

00:32:44.127 --> 00:32:52.292
is on small, small things like 'My father
is like this..my sister-in-law is like this'

00:32:52.317 --> 00:33:03.751
all this kind of things, you forget. And don't
condemn yourself either. If you condemn yourself

00:33:03.776 --> 00:33:14.491
it's of no use because now you are a realised
soul. There is no need to condemn but just

00:33:14.516 --> 00:33:24.682
to watch without thinking. That's what is
called as sakshi, is the witness state.

00:33:24.707 --> 00:33:36.672
That witness state you have to attain and
once you attain that witness state you start

00:33:36.697 --> 00:33:48.922
enjoying everything. Supposing somebody is
nasty, you can see the humour behind that.

00:33:48.947 --> 00:33:59.182
Supposing somebody is aggressive, you can
just smile at it. You can see that, poor thing

00:33:59.207 --> 00:34:10.712
you know, he's doing something wrong because
he can't help it, or she is mischievous, doesn't

00:34:10.737 --> 00:34:25.542
matter, she'll be alright. An attitude of
an innocent personality. You are innocent

00:34:25.567 --> 00:34:37.802
you don't see anything wrong with anyone.
If you are cunning you see everybody as cunning.

00:34:37.827 --> 00:34:48.011
But innocence is thousand times blessed by
the Divine. The Divine blesses the innocence.

00:34:48.036 --> 00:34:56.722
Now you might say 'How is it Mother so many
people are killed who were innocent? How it

00:34:56.747 --> 00:35:07.251
has happened?' It's alright, they were not
realised souls, and some of them, like Christ,

00:35:07.276 --> 00:35:16.972
went through through the ordeal. It has a
meaning His crucifixion has a very great meaning.

00:35:16.997 --> 00:35:28.592
For us it is of great help because He crucified
himself. Now we can pass through the Agnya

00:35:28.617 --> 00:35:29.646
chakra.

00:35:29.646 --> 00:35:40.001
Every one have, they all of them have helped
so much in building up your Kundalini, in

00:35:40.026 --> 00:35:51.472
helping you and working it out. All their
so-called ordeals and sacrifices have done

00:35:51.497 --> 00:36:05.741
so much which you will understand through
your witness state. It's all like in a garden,

00:36:05.766 --> 00:36:14.772
everybody has to work, the gardener has to
work, then the seed is put in and the Mother

00:36:14.797 --> 00:36:25.592
Earth has to work and the water has to work
and then it sprouts. Still it takes time,

00:36:25.617 --> 00:36:36.602
then you see when it is a blossom time, all
the flowers are there, but behind those flowers

00:36:36.627 --> 00:36:48.620
there's such a big effort of people. In the
same way, all those people who have put in

00:36:48.656 --> 00:36:55.477
their effort are within us and they will help
us.

00:36:55.477 --> 00:37:02.871
With Sahaja Yoga, getting realisation, if
you don't spread Sahaja Yoga then you have

00:37:02.896 --> 00:37:16.192
done no justice, justice to Sahaja Yoga. You
cannot help it, it's such a thing, just the

00:37:16.217 --> 00:37:26.072
other way round like a man who is selfish.
A selfish man will never like to share but

00:37:26.097 --> 00:37:37.552
a realised soul would like to share everything
with others and enjoy, enjoy the sharing.

00:37:37.577 --> 00:37:46.981
So many beautiful people come up. They become
so beautiful and so nice, so relaxed, so balanced

00:37:47.006 --> 00:37:58.552
that amazing, you are surprised at yourself
that 'I had all this treasure within me? All

00:37:58.577 --> 00:38:11.131
this beauty within me? Which I am absolutely
enjoying.' You enjoy yourself you enjoy others

00:38:11.156 --> 00:38:16.097
you enjoy every little bit of it.

00:38:16.097 --> 00:38:25.312
So I bless you all from my heart. So many
of you got realisation. As I've told you we

00:38:25.337 --> 00:38:32.337
have to change the destiny of human beings.
We have not come here to destroy but we have

00:38:32.896 --> 00:38:41.310
come here to grown and the destiny has to
be changed and that is what we have to work

00:38:41.335 --> 00:38:42.855
out.

00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:45.001
May God bless you.

00:38:55.581 --> 00:39:07.985
Derek Lee: "Shri Mataji there are one or two
new people here" Shri Mataji: "So what do

00:39:08.010 --> 00:39:15.459
they want?" (laughter) Derek Lee: "I don't
know if you want to answer questions or ask

00:39:15.484 --> 00:39:17.245
them to feel..."

00:39:29.230 --> 00:39:34.631
Shri Mataji: (laughing) "Alright! Derek is
trying to look after you all and he says that

00:39:34.656 --> 00:39:41.656
there are many new people here and they would
like to ask you questions. (laughter) So you

00:39:51.124 --> 00:40:02.341
see sometimes I'm surprised because you become
just like a criminal or you have to confess

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:13.193
something. Like yesterday they asked me 'Are
you a Goddess?' I said 'Bapare, what should

00:40:13.218 --> 00:40:21.881
I say?' I said 'Do you want me to confess
something?' Then they kept quiet. So now what's

00:40:21.906 --> 00:40:30.511
all the questions. Questions should be related
to your growth and not to nonsensical things,

00:40:30.536 --> 00:40:41.282
why waste energy? It's not a political party
or anything, it's something spiritual. So

00:40:41.307 --> 00:40:48.307
if you want to ask, ask for your spiritual
growth."

00:41:10.377 --> 00:41:51.316
Indian lady asks question in Hindi

00:42:26.662 --> 00:42:29.672
Derek Lee: "She says she comes from America

00:42:29.697 --> 00:42:36.293
and can't sleep because all things going around
in her head so she

00:42:36.318 --> 00:42:38.218
can't sleep"

00:42:38.361 --> 00:42:48.457
(hindi)

00:42:54.853 --> 00:43:04.182
Shri Mataji: "I know about seven languages
but I'm trying to learn Italian which is very

00:43:04.207 --> 00:43:17.456
difficult for me"
Seeker: "Buonasera, pranaam"

00:43:19.777 --> 00:43:26.777
Shri Mataji: "That much I know!"

00:43:41.348 --> 00:43:50.020
Seeker: "Would you say Sahaja Yoga includes
and subsumes other religions or is it a separate

00:43:50.045 --> 00:43:50.972
religion?"

00:43:51.131 --> 00:43:57.400
Shri Mataji: "It includes. Of course, it includes
all the religions, all the essence of all

00:43:57.425 --> 00:44:07.611
the religions. Religion is again step by step
is a warning to human beings. How can you

00:44:07.636 --> 00:44:18.602
exclude? But the essence, the essence of religion,
not all the humbug that people have done."

00:44:29.718 --> 00:44:39.222
Seeker: "From deep inside my heart I'd like
to thank you for not only what you have done

00:44:39.247 --> 00:44:46.247
for me but for what you've done for thousands
and thousands of people all over the world."

00:45:05.487 --> 00:45:06.827
(applause)

00:45:10.299 --> 00:45:57.921
Shri Mataji: "I hope he's speaking for all
of you? (more applause) So joy giving. Such

00:45:57.946 --> 00:46:09.042
a joy giving response. I mean it's like the
waves that touch the shore and then again

00:46:09.067 --> 00:46:19.396
another series of waves start. You see there's
no end to it, it's so beautiful. Thank you,

00:46:19.421 --> 00:46:29.032
thank you very much. Any other question?"

00:46:32.651 --> 00:46:39.651
Seeker: "Is there a right or a wrong way to
meditate?"

00:46:39.676 --> 00:46:53.452
Shri Mataji: "There is no wrong way, I don't
understand. I mean, with respect, with respect

00:46:53.477 --> 00:47:04.512
if you do any meditation it's perfect, but
first of all is your heart and your mind must

00:47:04.537 --> 00:47:18.332
have respect. In anyway when you meditate,
you should do it with love, that's all. Love

00:47:18.357 --> 00:47:27.079
will cleanse everything. I mean, if you stand
on your head and meditate, it's alright, but

00:47:36.092 --> 00:47:47.972
there's no need to do that! (laughter) Just
sit down and meditate. What's that?"

00:47:47.997 --> 00:47:54.997
Seeker: " What do you think of Sahaja Maithuna
to awaken the kundalini?"

00:48:10.593 --> 00:48:28.581
Shri Mataji: "If you want you can try. But
it's dangerous"

00:49:00.299 --> 00:49:05.443
Seeker: "Are we just play things for a higher
being?"

00:49:13.154 --> 00:49:17.002
Derek Lee: "He's puzzled why do we have free
will"

00:49:22.106 --> 00:49:32.432
Shri Mataji: "You see spiritually people are
not matured very much and once they get realisation,

00:49:32.457 --> 00:49:39.457
because it's so simple and so easy that they
don't understand the value of it. But those

00:49:40.534 --> 00:49:51.812
who are matured, those who are real seekers
take to it very seriously. It's no question

00:49:51.837 --> 00:50:02.432
of free will, it's your growth, your maturity.
Depends on that. Some people are really great

00:50:02.457 --> 00:50:11.731
seekers and some are alright trying, and some
are doing it just because of some sort of

00:50:11.756 --> 00:50:21.302
a fashion. It should be earnestly coming from
your heart that you are seeking the Truth.

00:50:21.327 --> 00:50:29.921
That's very important. Those who want to shun
the Truth of course are no good, but those

00:50:29.946 --> 00:50:36.941
who are half-hearted also, they take time,
but gradually, with experience, they jump

00:50:36.966 --> 00:50:38.052
into it."

00:50:40.136 --> 00:50:50.037
Same seeker: "Shri Mataji surely those who
are less evolved and less open are the most

00:50:50.062 --> 00:50:55.231
in need, surely it should come easier to them?"

00:50:55.409 --> 00:51:03.342
Shri Mataji: "It is. It is easier for all
of you. I mean the way you got realisation

00:51:03.367 --> 00:51:10.792
nobody could have believed it. I also couldn't
believe, in the beginning, how it is working

00:51:10.817 --> 00:51:23.732
so fast. But, it works. Like you can say that
certain flowers bloom faster than others.

00:51:23.757 --> 00:51:38.372
I'm not bothered on that point, because if
they have the slightest desire to be the Spirit,

00:51:38.397 --> 00:51:45.397
they become. Also Divine is anxious to give
you. " (applause)

00:52:06.557 --> 00:52:12.562
Seeker: "You said meditate with love but I
was just trying to think what love is because

00:52:12.587 --> 00:52:14.962
I don't really understand about love"

00:52:28.607 --> 00:52:36.405
Shri Mataji: "ah! (laughter) I mean, love
is a human quality. What is there to understand?

00:52:43.077 --> 00:52:57.394
People love even dogs and animals. Do you
have a dog? (laughter) Love means without

00:52:57.757 --> 00:53:13.921
any malice, without any anger, something that
is desired. It's such an abstract thing that

00:53:13.946 --> 00:53:22.592
you cannot put it in words but it's a feeling
within you and when you meditate with love

00:53:22.617 --> 00:53:29.436
means that supposing you are very angry and
you are frustrated then you come meditate

00:53:29.436 --> 00:53:36.436
and go on saying things like 'Mother, do this!
kill him! Do that!' It doesn't work out. But

00:53:42.686 --> 00:53:54.342
in love means actually it is no thought. Love
is no thought it's just a feeling, feeling

00:53:54.367 --> 00:54:01.367
of emancipation. Just a feeling "

00:54:25.522 --> 00:54:32.522
Seeker: "How would you describe the benefits
of Sahaja Yoga meditation compared with other

00:54:32.547 --> 00:54:34.017
types of meditation?"

00:54:34.017 --> 00:54:46.691
Shri Mataji: "The first and foremost thing
is you must feel the vibrations on your hands.

00:54:46.716 --> 00:54:58.272
Cool vibrations which is the Divine Love of
All-Pervading Power. You should feel it coming

00:54:58.297 --> 00:55:10.632
out of your fontanelle bone area. With any
meditation it doesn't happen, anyone, then

00:55:10.657 --> 00:55:21.722
that is not correct. This is the minimum that
should happen that you should feel your vibrations

00:55:21.747 --> 00:55:33.082
like cool breeze on your hand and out of the
fontanelle bone area. This is the minimum

00:55:33.107 --> 00:55:44.075
to start. With no meditation it happens. That
man in the window."

00:56:06.202 --> 00:56:15.107
Seeker: "What has love got to do with religion?"

00:56:15.267 --> 00:56:27.318
Shri Mataji: "It's the essence of religion
is love. Essence. What he's saying? You can't

00:56:27.343 --> 00:56:30.113
hear me?"

00:56:43.696 --> 00:56:50.696
Seeker: "People who are involved in religion
are often scared"

00:56:50.721 --> 00:57:01.151
Shri Mataji: "Correct, I agree, because they
are not religious"

00:57:05.716 --> 00:57:12.716
Seeker: "Love doesn't need religion"
Shri Mataji: "Yes of course. Of course. It

00:57:17.497 --> 00:57:31.868
doesn't need any name. Love is love. But there
is an innate religion within us. Innate religion

00:57:32.297 --> 00:57:44.562
is the enlightenment of the Spirit. It's innate.
You may call it religion you may call it divine

00:57:44.587 --> 00:57:58.401
love call it by any name but within us is
that source which creates a new personality

00:57:58.426 --> 00:58:08.463
imbibed with love and that we can call as
an innate religion within."

00:58:25.727 --> 00:58:32.727
Seeker: "Is Self-realisation the same as enlightenment?"

00:58:37.127 --> 00:58:44.127
Shri Mataji: "Of course. There are many names."

00:58:52.247 --> 00:59:05.247
Seeker: "Is Sahaja Yoga the only path to Self-realisation?"

00:59:05.888 --> 00:59:12.888
Shri Mataji: "I should say yes. I haven't
seen any other"

00:59:30.207 --> 00:59:40.048
Seeker: "Why do you need to raise the Kundalini
to meditate or to get enlightenment?"

00:59:46.517 --> 00:59:57.518
Shri Mataji: "That's how it is made. Why do
you connect this (microphone) to the mains?

00:59:57.543 --> 01:00:06.302
In the same way, you are to be connected.
For the connection to the All-Pervading Power

01:00:06.327 --> 01:00:10.997
your Kundalini has to be raised. Alright?"

01:00:10.997 --> 01:00:19.492
Seeker: "How does the Holy Ghost come in to
all of this?"

01:00:24.893 --> 01:00:35.002
Shri Mataji: "It's the Holy Ghost only doing
everything! When you will come to Sahaja Yoga

01:00:35.027 --> 01:00:46.002
and will go deep into it you will know. It's
all the work of Holy Ghost. I don't know why

01:00:46.027 --> 01:00:53.027
they call it a ghost! (laughter)"

01:01:02.466 --> 01:01:13.472
Seeker: "Is it dangerous to open up the seven
levels of awareness without proper guidance?"

01:01:13.497 --> 01:01:22.802
Shri Mataji: "You see, it's only which can
do it and I don't think anyone knows how to

01:01:22.827 --> 01:01:30.542
work it out that way, so it should be done
in a proper manner. But Kundalini knows, she

01:01:30.567 --> 01:01:38.441
knows everything about you, and She knows
your problems and when She rises She does

01:01:38.466 --> 01:01:46.752
it so sweetly without harming you without
troubling you, so best thing is to get your

01:01:46.777 --> 01:01:50.593
Self-realisation established."

01:01:56.298 --> 01:02:02.413
Seeker: "How do you raise the Kundalini?"

01:02:07.436 --> 01:02:24.962
Shri Mataji: "Me? Now I can't you see, what
I can do, no use telling you because you can't

01:02:24.987 --> 01:02:35.842
do that, isn't it? You can raise the Kundalini
once you are a realised soul, you can also

01:02:35.867 --> 01:02:44.083
raise, but maybe not like Me. When you reach
My stage you will! (applause and laughter)"

01:02:56.166 --> 01:03:07.550
Seeker: "Can you tell us about your early
life when you first realised about Self-realisation"

01:03:11.216 --> 01:03:25.304
Shri Mataji: "You see I think there's a book
about it. Alright? You better read it."

01:03:25.329 --> 01:03:30.415
Seeker: "Can you tell me how we stimulate
the Kundalini to rise when we meditate at

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:30.980
home?"

01:03:38.902 --> 01:03:46.752
Shri Mataji: "I mean they know. There's a
photograph that they use to begin with and

01:03:46.777 --> 01:03:55.342
that helps. But you must come to centres where
they tell you exactly what is to be done.

01:03:55.367 --> 01:04:03.151
Little bit time has to be given to understand
it. You must all come to the centre, how many

01:04:03.176 --> 01:04:17.641
of you come to the centre raise your hand.
See, not even 10%. Please put it down. So

01:04:17.666 --> 01:04:27.532
it is important that you should go to the
centre, master it, become a full fledged,

01:04:27.576 --> 01:04:34.032
I should say, sahaja yogi and give realisations
to others, that's, your duty bound, you have

01:04:34.057 --> 01:04:43.962
to do it. Otherwise it's like what Christ
has said that some seeds fell on the rock

01:04:43.987 --> 01:04:52.141
and some seeds fell in the marshy land and
some in the fertile. If you are a person of

01:04:52.166 --> 01:04:59.166
fertile temperament it will work out. Alright?"

01:05:05.176 --> 01:05:14.853
Seeker: "Is Self-realisation when you realise
that you are everything?"

01:05:16.131 --> 01:05:26.600
Shri Mataji: "When you are a realised soul,
if you are that, but do you feel the vibrations?

01:05:27.686 --> 01:05:35.138
Do you feel vibrations of others? Then you
are not it's just a myth"

01:05:35.253 --> 01:05:44.062
Seeker: "It has happened to me but it was
such a shock that I came back in to the body"

01:05:53.158 --> 01:06:00.158
Shri Mataji: "You better take to, seriously,
to Sahaja Yoga. Alright?"

01:06:05.681 --> 01:06:12.681
Seeker: "When you describe the state of thoughtless
awareness you make it so beautiful it sounds

01:06:12.706 --> 01:06:16.327
so simple so why for some is it so difficult
to achieve?"

01:06:24.077 --> 01:06:32.512
Shri Mataji: "I know, I know, I know, but
one has to work it out, that you look at something

01:06:32.537 --> 01:06:40.332
without thinking. Try! Try to do that. I know
it's difficult for some people because too

01:06:40.357 --> 01:06:46.337
much of thoughts in the mind all the time.
Now the thought comes from the left or from

01:06:46.337 --> 01:06:53.572
the right, that is it comes from the past,
from our conditionings, and comes from the

01:06:53.597 --> 01:07:02.671
right with our ego and futuristic ideas. All
the time. So one thought will rise, fall,

01:07:02.696 --> 01:07:09.537
another will fall and rise and we are jumping
on the cusp of the thoughts. But when Kundalini

01:07:09.537 --> 01:07:18.572
rises, what happens that these thoughts elongate
and the space in between is created that is

01:07:18.597 --> 01:07:25.037
thoughtless awareness. Now how to do it is
the problem with people. [By] raising your

01:07:25.037 --> 01:07:32.641
Kundalini. You raise your Kundalini, raise
the Kundalini of others, suddenly you will

01:07:32.666 --> 01:07:43.639
find that you become thoughtlessly aware.
Not difficult. What's that?"

01:08:06.472 --> 01:08:13.472
Seeker: "It's not a question really, a friend
brought me tonight and I came here with a

01:08:13.497 --> 01:08:18.517
lot of scepticism but I appreciated the directness
and the simplicity of what you said and the

01:08:18.517 --> 01:08:20.408
way you explained things."

01:08:20.433 --> 01:08:23.273
Shri Mataji: "Thank you."

01:08:34.847 --> 01:08:41.847
Seeker: "Is there a reason why the Divine
love expresses itself as a cool breeze?"

01:08:49.237 --> 01:08:56.237
Shri Mataji: "We should ask the Divine Love
about it"

01:09:10.329 --> 01:09:26.416
Seeker: "Can you see a day coming when we
have a global Self-realisation amongst world

01:09:26.441 --> 01:09:33.149
leaders so that people don't starve the way
they do at the moment? Can you see that within

01:09:33.174 --> 01:09:35.930
the age of aquarius?"

01:09:45.372 --> 01:09:54.716
Shri Mataji: "This is the Age of Aquarius.
This is the Age, but we can't say how many

01:09:54.716 --> 01:10:06.532
will be there, saved. We can't say. If you
people work it out you can save so many. But

01:10:06.557 --> 01:10:14.796
this is the Age of Aquarius no doubt, no doubt.
"

01:10:25.150 --> 01:10:31.091
Seeker: "How do you forgive absolutely?"

01:10:34.627 --> 01:10:42.102
Shri Mataji: "Whether you forgive or you don't
forgive you don't do anything. What do you

01:10:42.127 --> 01:10:54.603
do? Alright? But when you don't forgive, mentally,
then you suffer, not the other person."

01:10:54.628 --> 01:10:59.039
Seeker: "How can you change your heart so
that you can forgive?"

01:11:06.987 --> 01:11:13.987
Shri Mataji: "Heart is not needed. Only you
understand that, whether you forgive or you

01:11:14.097 --> 01:11:25.560
don't forgive you don't do anything. You just
say 'I forgive' "

01:11:25.843 --> 01:11:29.956
Seeker: "I can say it but I don't mean it"

01:11:35.367 --> 01:11:39.930
Shri Mataji: "You may not mean but it's a
mantra, you just say 'I forgive everyone'

01:11:40.642 --> 01:11:46.201
Alright? It acts. It acts"

01:11:55.622 --> 01:12:02.622
Seeker: "Is Sahaja Yoga the answer to a lot
of psychiatric problems?"

01:12:08.353 --> 01:12:12.424
Shri Mataji: "Who? You?"

01:12:14.969 --> 01:12:24.776
Seeker: "Can it solve the problems of schizophrenic
problems?"

01:12:31.406 --> 01:12:35.146
Shri Mataji: "Of course"

01:12:35.146 --> 01:12:44.543
Seeker: "People are investing a lot of money
on psychiatric research"

01:12:44.575 --> 01:12:50.284
Shri Mataji: "What to do they don't listen
to me!" (applause)

01:13:23.407 --> 01:13:38.855
Seeker: "Are you saying there's a light within
us all and we are all part of God and for

01:13:38.880 --> 01:13:45.880
future generations to come will this benefit
the whole world?"

01:13:56.400 --> 01:14:03.351
Shri Mataji: "Of course you are"

01:14:03.376 --> 01:14:09.402
Seeker: "Will it benefit future generations?
Is this what your trying to do?"

01:14:17.094 --> 01:14:24.964
Shri Mataji: "Yes. But what I'm saying is
-- first you get your realisation established,

01:14:24.989 --> 01:14:31.423
you get alright, you perfect yourself and
then you can do it yourself."

01:14:32.145 --> 01:14:35.847
(same seeker tries to ask the same question
again! )

01:14:48.425 --> 01:14:55.425
Shri Mataji: "You work it out till I come
next time and you won't ask any questions!"

01:14:55.450 --> 01:15:04.171
(applause)

01:15:21.696 --> 01:15:31.227
Seeker: "Does Mother protect us in Sahaja
Yoga wherever we are?"

01:15:37.246 --> 01:15:46.546
Shri Mataji: "Of course but I don't want to
say that. You can experience."

01:15:57.916 --> 01:16:02.597
Seeker: "How do I know when I've had my Self-realisation?"

01:16:13.013 --> 01:16:19.852
Shri Mataji: "You will feel the cool breeze
blowing into your hands and out of your fontanelle

01:16:19.877 --> 01:16:26.877
bone area. That's the first step, first step."

01:16:30.687 --> 01:16:38.424
Seeker: "When doing Sahaja Yoga is it alright
still to use other spiritual stuff like Reiki

01:16:38.459 --> 01:16:40.029
and Crystals"

01:16:46.846 --> 01:16:58.250
Shri Mataji: "No, no! Reiki's experience has
been very bad. No no no no! If you ask me

01:16:58.275 --> 01:16:59.218
I would say

01:16:59.243 --> 01:16:59.933
don't do

01:16:59.958 --> 01:17:11.607
because I know how people have suffered
with that. It's unscientific.

01:17:31.628 --> 01:17:40.049
Now can you all please put your hands
towards me and close your eyes.

01:17:40.074 --> 01:17:43.398
Forget about all
the questions..."

01:17:46.265 --> 01:17:49.902
Only thing you have to do is to forgive.

01:17:49.902 --> 01:17:53.102
Forgive everyone, that's all.

01:17:53.102 --> 01:17:56.719
Just say, it is only saying: "I forgive".

01:18:02.377 --> 01:18:08.096
Just say: "I forgive, I forgive everyone".

01:18:08.096 --> 01:18:10.243
See how it will work.

01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:18.000
Now, put your right hand towards Me,

01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:22.808
and left hand on the top of the fontanel bone area.

01:18:23.137 --> 01:18:28.314
And find out not touching it on the top,

01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:35.740
if there is a cool or hot breeze coming out of your head.

01:18:37.023 --> 01:18:38.471
If there is hot,

01:18:39.113 --> 01:18:42.629
that means that you have some liver trouble or something like that.

01:18:42.629 --> 01:18:47.624
Which should be corrected or maybe you have not forgiven.

01:18:51.617 --> 01:19:00.998
Sometimes it blows out too much on the sides or upward.

01:19:00.998 --> 01:19:03.497
Please see for yourselves.

01:19:06.206 --> 01:19:11.412
Now, put your left hand towards Me please,

01:19:11.768 --> 01:19:15.428
and put your right hand on the top of your head.

01:19:16.070 --> 01:19:19.282
Bend your head, it's better to bend.

01:19:19.923 --> 01:19:23.620
And now see for yourselves if it is cool breeze

01:19:23.620 --> 01:19:28.269
or hot breeze coming out of your fontanel bone area,

01:19:28.341 --> 01:19:32.081
which was a soft bone in your childhood.

01:19:32.081 --> 01:19:34.081
Just try.

01:19:40.141 --> 01:19:48.041
This is the baptism, real baptism, actualisation of baptism.

01:19:48.540 --> 01:19:51.160
Now, bring both the hands

01:19:51.160 --> 01:19:55.359
like this towards Me, open your eyes.

01:19:55.359 --> 01:19:58.334
And see for yourselves if there is

01:19:58.334 --> 01:20:01.104
a cool breeze or hot breeze

01:20:02.174 --> 01:20:08.054
like vibrations flowing towards you.

01:20:08.054 --> 01:20:14.332
Some might get it from below the hands, and you put them back like this.

01:20:14.332 --> 01:20:16.760
 Some do.

01:20:26.670 --> 01:20:29.526
Very good.

01:20:29.526 --> 01:20:32.787
Please raise your hands like this.

01:20:35.069 --> 01:20:36.214
Like this.

01:20:41.918 --> 01:20:44.643
You are getting thoughtless.

01:20:44.643 --> 01:20:46.141
Just watch Me.

01:21:03.752 --> 01:21:08.382
May God bless you.
