WEBVTT

04:43.866 --> 04:53.243
Today we have all gathered here for
worshipping your Guru.

04:54.015 --> 05:02.706
As you know that the principle of Guru
resides in the Void.

05:06.424 --> 05:11.022
This is the principle which gives you
balance,

05:13.247 --> 05:18.834
which gives you the gravity.

05:19.040 --> 05:28.241
The gravity that we have in the Mother
Earth

05:31.090 --> 05:38.637
is expressed through your Guru principle.

05:42.158 --> 05:47.961
The first point of gravity is

05:48.981 --> 05:59.109
that you should have a personality,
a character and a temperament

05:59.865 --> 06:13.937
that people would see that you are
a personality

06:14.138 --> 06:21.161
who doesn’t get dissolved into worldly
things.

06:21.362 --> 06:35.541
Is a personality which doesn’t get ruined
by the skirmishes of life.

06:35.742 --> 06:46.840
Is the personality of a Guru which sits
down deep into his -

06:50.000 --> 07:05.993
into his being and is not easily disturbed
or dissolved by

07:12.602 --> 07:15.400
any solvent what-so-ever.

07:15.601 --> 07:24.590
This is the first principle of the Guru, is
the gravity.

07:24.791 --> 07:31.043
As I told you, it is something which cannot
be dissolved into anything.

07:31.244 --> 07:36.948
It settles very deep down into your
personality.

07:37.149 --> 07:41.565
So it doesn’t float in the water.

07:42.748 --> 07:49.874
Now you see, in the countries which are
developed very much

07:50.191 --> 08:03.274
we think that we have a very great power
of individual attainment.

08:03.475 --> 08:13.104
That individually we are absolutely free,
we can do whatever we like

08:13.438 --> 08:20.372
and that’s why individual freedom becomes
the goal of all democratic countries,

08:20.573 --> 08:27.228
neglecting the collective. Of course,
individual is important,

08:27.429 --> 08:31.820
and it has to become all right to nourish
the collective.

08:32.021 --> 08:38.502
But if the individual does not have
the gravity,

08:38.703 --> 08:48.854
then they float on the surface and anything
can impress them.

08:49.055 --> 08:55.059
That’s why we find today people get
impressed by fashions.

08:55.260 --> 09:05.778
By fashions, which by no logical reason are
good for your health, for your wisdom.

09:05.979 --> 09:08.275
[To somebody, "Sit down".]

09:08.832 --> 09:19.307
No fashion is good for your health, nor for
your development as a personality.

09:19.508 --> 09:25.486
Sometimes you look so odd with it,
so funny, so stupid.

09:25.687 --> 09:30.575
Then this, ask your question, “What’s
wrong in becoming stupid?

09:30.776 --> 09:34.930
What’s wrong in becoming foolish?”

09:36.954 --> 09:43.254
The reason is, you have an individual
freedom, but your personality has not grown.

09:43.455 --> 09:47.454
You personality is zero. You have no
personality left.

09:47.655 --> 09:50.114
You cannot decide anything for yourself.

09:50.315 --> 09:54.309
Whatever is the fashion you just run after
that.

09:54.510 --> 10:03.589
Is this situation of the Western countries,
but in the countries like India now

10:03.790 --> 10:08.778
there are also in some sort of a craze.

10:09.000 --> 10:17.072
Because they have to still pass through
this so-called affluence that you have.

10:17.273 --> 10:20.148
So they'll take to the crazes, like
supposing

10:20.349 --> 10:23.482
somebody sees a very beautiful carpet with
someone,

10:23.683 --> 10:26.566
then all rush to buy that carpet.

10:26.767 --> 10:31.435
They’ll do anything for getting things
to themselves.

10:31.636 --> 10:35.472
So they turn towards materialism also
in the same way

10:35.673 --> 10:39.884
as you people turn to fashions.

10:40.873 --> 10:49.078
The individuality is all right up to
a point, but then it becomes a madness.

10:49.279 --> 10:56.393
Especially in the west the personality is
so low, is so missing

10:56.594 --> 11:04.248
that any entrepreneur can develop any
craze, any name

11:04.449 --> 11:07.802
and everybody runs after that and is
impressed.

11:08.003 --> 11:12.411
Like a stupid fellow can call himself by
some name,

11:12.612 --> 11:19.813
say, he can call his… by some funny name -
now, say "Poison", as he says.

11:20.014 --> 11:24.600
Now to everyone to buy "Poison" is a very
great thing.

11:24.801 --> 11:30.615
Because it is by some stupid man who has
taken a name and so everybody must buy that.

11:30.816 --> 11:34.676
It is nothing special about it. It is
nothing special,

11:34.877 --> 11:44.241
it is nothing – remarkable. It is nothing
that will make you something great.

11:44.442 --> 11:49.053
But people will buy that particular make,
because it has a brand

11:49.254 --> 11:54.774
which everybody will accept. “Oh!
It’s from that particular brand.”

11:55.813 --> 11:59.256
And it’s such a madness about it.

11:59.457 --> 12:04.180
Then comes to the anything from hair style,
up to your foot style,

12:04.381 --> 12:08.675
to your neck style, to your nail style,
to your eyebrow style.

12:08.876 --> 12:13.797
I mean, anything, any stupid thing that you
could do to your body is available

12:13.998 --> 12:19.047
and people take to it because they have
no gravity in them.

12:20.363 --> 12:26.885
The persons who have gravity do not take
to such changes.

12:27.086 --> 12:31.424
First logically, they’ll try to know if
this change is good or not.

12:31.625 --> 12:34.931
But only because it’s a change, it's
a craze,

12:35.132 --> 12:39.276
it's a fashion, they do not take to it.

12:41.499 --> 12:45.596
This is one of the signs of gravity in
a person

12:45.797 --> 12:53.665
that he doesn’t float on the ground like
straws.

12:53.866 --> 13:00.879
But it stays, it stays like a beautiful
pearl

13:01.080 --> 13:06.953
in the deep shores of understanding.

13:08.148 --> 13:13.097
So those who are today here to worship
the Guru,

13:13.298 --> 13:16.395
they have to worship their own Guru within
themselves

13:16.596 --> 13:20.688
and have to understand that first thing
and foremost thing is

13:20.889 --> 13:25.269
that we must have gravity in temperament.

13:25.658 --> 13:30.296
You do not need education for that,
university education.

13:30.497 --> 13:35.990
You need not read books, you need not
do anything.

13:36.816 --> 13:43.780
Only thing is that you have to have your
value system corrected.

13:44.275 --> 13:48.961
When your value system is corrected, you
understand

13:49.162 --> 13:56.178
what is good for the society, what is good
for you.

13:56.379 --> 14:03.665
For example, if it’s a lotus flower, it
will never emit filth and dirt.

14:03.866 --> 14:09.877
The fragrance will be always there; if it
is a rose or any other fragrant thing,

14:10.078 --> 14:14.746
it will emit fragrance only.

14:15.368 --> 14:19.599
It cannot emit something that is filthy.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.660
Now those who think they are Gurus and have
achieved that gravity

14:24.861 --> 14:33.240
will never write something which is ugly,
say something which is dirty,

14:33.441 --> 14:44.463
will never use their mind to appreciate
anything that is filthy and wrong.

14:46.985 --> 14:52.143
This is the second sign of your value
system.

14:52.344 --> 15:00.197
In your value system you have to first
of all understand what is auspiciousness,

15:00.855 --> 15:05.054
what is Divine beauty,

15:06.332 --> 15:11.801
and what is morality of the Spirit.

15:12.134 --> 15:18.898
These three things are to be realized and
are to be part and parcel of your being

15:19.099 --> 15:26.013
so that when people see you, they should
say, “Here is a person we can see

15:26.214 --> 15:33.869
who has that gravity, here is the person
who has that beauty.”

15:34.273 --> 15:37.795
It acts inside, outside.

15:37.996 --> 15:44.122
A person who has that sobriety inside
dresses up in a sober way.

15:44.343 --> 15:51.608
He doesn’t dress up to impress others, or
just to show off or to hide something

15:51.809 --> 15:58.765
or to expose something. But just to respect
his body, he dresses up.

15:58.966 --> 16:03.695
When he talks to others, he talks wisdom.

16:03.896 --> 16:09.117
He doesn’t talk frivolous things, useless
things

16:09.318 --> 16:17.935
and things which are of very baser level.

16:18.813 --> 16:31.882
In his own enterprises, I would say, he has
a kind of a decency and a decorum.

16:32.083 --> 16:38.008
Like a person tries to become an expert.

16:38.209 --> 16:47.534
A person who worships his Guru, tries to be
an expert in his work,

16:47.735 --> 16:53.147
like supposing, there is a person who is
an engineer.

16:53.361 --> 16:58.223
He doesn’t care for money, he doesn’t care
for fame,

16:58.424 --> 17:02.545
he doesn’t care for applauses
from others.

17:02.746 --> 17:09.791
What he cares is, does he really understand
his subject matter. It won’t be mediocrisy.

17:09.992 --> 17:17.423
Musician has to be perfectly a musician.
Artist has to be a perfect artist.

17:17.624 --> 17:23.688
He does not use the general methods
of expertise,

17:23.889 --> 17:30.024
but his Spirit, the guidance of his Spirit
he tries to improve.

17:30.225 --> 17:37.535
Like there’s a poet, he tries to improve
his poetry on the level of his Spirit,

17:37.736 --> 17:43.231
but not on the level of money, because
normally people would write things

17:43.432 --> 17:47.831
just to please the majority of the people,
so they can sell their books

17:48.032 --> 17:52.792
or something filthy which is not benevolent
to the society,

17:52.993 --> 17:58.613
nor to the name of the writer, they don’t
mind, they become shameless about it.

17:58.814 --> 18:06.194
So not that the Guru himself has the value
system, but through his life style,

18:06.395 --> 18:12.905
through his own preachings, through his
own behavior

18:13.106 --> 18:21.298
he radiates gravity to others – he radiates
gravity to others.

18:23.679 --> 18:29.363
So it builds up our value system, value
system of a balance.

18:29.564 --> 18:34.215
But it does not mean that if somebody wants
to become an expert on one subject

18:34.416 --> 18:38.254
then he neglects the other side.
It’s in balance,

18:38.455 --> 18:43.155
it has to be in balance, a person say,
for example, who is a musician

18:43.356 --> 18:52.049
and cannot understand a painting – he is
not an artist.

18:52.446 --> 18:57.024
Supposing you are an artist and still you
do not understand Sahaja Yoga,

18:57.225 --> 19:00.297
then you are not a Yogi.

19:00.738 --> 19:08.524
So if you start from the central point of
your spirit, you’ll be surprised that

19:08.849 --> 19:17.173
the knowledge that you receive or whatever
you give is absolutely integrated

19:17.374 --> 19:21.423
and radiates from one point.

19:21.971 --> 19:31.200
So, in every way you become an expert, in
any subject you become an expert.

19:31.401 --> 19:35.492
Anybody asks you a question, you know
everything.

19:35.693 --> 19:42.783
But in that you know what is worthless and
what is of worth.

19:42.984 --> 19:49.525
You try to understand what is important.

19:49.726 --> 19:54.884
You know, you give up whatever is worthless
and you would not like to know

19:55.085 --> 20:01.047
the names of different alcohols. You don’t
want to be expert in that.

20:01.248 --> 20:06.842
You don’t want to be an expert on knowing
all the names of all the carpet styles.

20:07.043 --> 20:11.728
You may not like to know all the varieties
of sarees.

20:11.929 --> 20:14.885
You may not like to know all the names of
all the cameras.

20:15.086 --> 20:21.121
You may know, but need not feel that you
do not.

20:21.739 --> 20:30.903
But whatever is important for the gravity
of a personality, you will know.

20:31.104 --> 20:38.725
So if you want to make it simple, we can
know about auspiciousness.

20:38.926 --> 20:46.012
What is auspicious? You’ll know about
fair play.

20:46.213 --> 20:49.142
What is a fair play towards others.

20:49.343 --> 20:55.500
You’ll know about what is justice in
the eyes of God.

20:55.754 --> 21:03.760
You’ll know about the Divine music that
elevates your Kundalini.

21:03.961 --> 21:10.498
So as a result of this gravity you get
discrimination.

21:10.901 --> 21:17.508
That you know what is your personality and
what is the water surrounding you.

21:17.709 --> 21:22.226
You know how to discriminate and this
discrimination

21:22.427 --> 21:29.278
is also actually innately comes from your
Guru principle.

21:29.572 --> 21:35.257
But once this Guru principle goes into

21:35.458 --> 21:42.326
a bizarre state or into some sort of
a turmoil or confusion,

21:42.540 --> 21:47.317
by so many other things like you have
a wrong guru, you have a false guru,

21:47.518 --> 21:54.998
you have false ideas, you follow false
doctrines, you follow false theories

21:55.199 --> 22:03.698
or you follow false books, then this goes
bizarre.

22:03.899 --> 22:12.301
As a result of that you develop Ekadesha
Rudra on top of your head.

22:12.502 --> 22:21.880
Also in case, when you have problems

22:22.081 --> 22:28.789
of not temperant and moderate life, if you
are an extremist,

22:28.990 --> 22:35.572
if you work too hard or you don’t work
at all or if you only go on

22:35.773 --> 22:41.524
projecting yourself into one side and not
paying attention

22:41.725 --> 22:44.992
to the other side of your life,

22:45.193 --> 22:50.432
with all these imbalances, physical,
mental, emotional and spiritual,

22:50.633 --> 22:55.007
you develop problems of your Guru
principle, as a result, you develop

22:55.208 --> 23:00.621
this Ekadesha Rudra, which is the beginning
of your destruction.

23:00.822 --> 23:05.401
So how important it is to look after your
Guru principle, you can see

23:05.602 --> 23:11.725
that most of the diseases are caused by
this principle, when neglected

23:11.926 --> 23:15.928
and ultimately they reach its high – their
heights,

23:16.129 --> 23:20.820
when it reaches the state of Ekadesha
Rudra.

23:21.021 --> 23:24.757
Now as realized souls you have crossed
the limit,

23:24.958 --> 23:32.602
you have come out of your Sahastrara, you
have transcended all those things

23:32.975 --> 23:39.187
through your Brahma Nadi. But that does not
mean that you have developed that gravity.

23:39.388 --> 23:46.395
You have now achieved a state.

23:46.596 --> 23:56.678
If a flower is there and you put the flower
on the water it will float.

23:57.044 --> 24:03.446
But when it becomes the fruit and matures,
then you put it in the water,

24:03.647 --> 24:08.982
it does not float, it goes deep down, it
doesn’t get dissolved.

24:09.183 --> 24:15.790
It keeps its own identity. That is what is
to be done now

24:15.991 --> 24:24.182
that you have to become the fruits of
Sahaja Yoga, fruits of Sahaja Yoga.

24:24.383 --> 24:28.516
Blossom time is over now, you have
to become fruits

24:28.791 --> 24:35.699
and people who see you should know
that you have no imbalances at all.

24:35.900 --> 24:43.695
You are the people with special gravity.
So when you talk to people –

24:43.896 --> 24:52.058
when you have any kind of Sahaja Yoga
program,

24:52.259 --> 24:56.091
you do not behave in a childish manner or
stupid manner.

24:56.292 --> 25:03.475
I’ve seen people sitting before Me raising
their Kundalini. It’s stupid.

25:05.690 --> 25:11.365
Or giving bandhan to themselves, is stupid.
So, even coming in the Sahaja Yoga,

25:11.566 --> 25:19.099
one can have that kind of a stupid behavior
or behavior without gravity.

25:19.300 --> 25:26.052
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga, if you
have the same style as you had before,

25:26.253 --> 25:31.725
then you have to grow, mature, you have
to become still the fruit.

25:31.926 --> 25:41.796
And that is the sign that you become really
the Guru principle people.

25:43.268 --> 25:52.769
It is important that we have to know
the gravity of the Mother Earth.

25:52.970 --> 25:57.978
How she revolves with such a tremendous
speed

25:58.179 --> 26:02.486
holding all of us together to her heart and
then

26:02.687 --> 26:08.699
she emits her beautiful Divine love through
the various beauties

26:08.900 --> 26:14.319
that are surrounding us, now we can see
for ourselves.

26:14.520 --> 26:19.118
Specially when I see the big mountains,

26:19.319 --> 26:26.896
I feel they are like great saints sitting
and meditating here.

26:27.097 --> 26:34.522
But they are the only ones who can catch
the Guru principle emitted by the sea.

26:34.723 --> 26:43.585
As you know the sea is the Guru principle,
and they are so high

26:43.786 --> 26:49.545
that they can catch the Guru principle. So
despite the fact you have that gravity,

26:49.746 --> 26:59.513
you are people of very high standards. And
you are beyond any temptations,

26:59.714 --> 27:08.346
any stupid ideas or any ideas that can
pervert or spoil others.

27:08.346 --> 27:15.996
You stand above everybody else, Stalwarts,
as we had very great people on this earth,

27:16.197 --> 27:20.920
I have given you the names and we said that
there have been ten Gurus,

27:21.121 --> 27:27.811
starting from Adi Nath, we had Confucius,
we had Socrates

27:28.012 --> 27:31.895
and later on we had Abraham, Moses and also

27:32.096 --> 27:37.721
up to Shirdi Sai Nath, we had about ten
great Gurus.

27:37.922 --> 27:42.224
Now we have so many here sitting down, they
are all Gurus

27:42.425 --> 27:47.887
and they have to behave like Gurus and
they have to do the job of great Gurus.

27:48.088 --> 27:53.925
And this is what today we have to see if we
can develop that gravity within ourselves

27:54.126 --> 28:02.930
and understanding within ourselves. When
that peace resides within you,

28:03.131 --> 28:10.138
the joy of becoming Sahaja Yogis will be
really felt,

28:10.339 --> 28:16.154
will be really understood and will be
enjoyed by all of you.

28:16.355 --> 28:19.912
May God bless you all!

28:33.126 --> 28:37.554
Here is a symbol of a dog because the Guru
always carries a dog

28:37.755 --> 28:41.872
because he is the one who knows only one
master.

28:42.073 --> 28:47.214
And this is the disciple principle of
the Guru.

28:47.415 --> 28:54.359
So the disciple principle is like a dog,
who guards the Guru,

28:54.560 --> 29:01.423
who shows complete devotion and dedication
and all the time on the watch

29:01.624 --> 29:06.163
that wrong type of people should not come
to the Guru.

29:06.364 --> 29:09.014
But on the contrary, I think sometimes in
Sahaja Yoga

29:09.215 --> 29:13.071
people always bring wrong type of people
to Me.

29:13.272 --> 29:16.851
It watches and it knows, it has such
discretion.

29:17.052 --> 29:21.595
It knows what to do and how to behave.

29:21.796 --> 29:26.225
This is what is the symbol of a disciple

29:26.426 --> 29:33.686
and so this symbol has to be understood
by all of you.

29:41.132 --> 29:45.303
Now for the puja today you sit in a very
surrendering mood

29:45.504 --> 29:48.657
so that this principle awakens within you.

29:48.858 --> 29:51.624
Nobody should try to raise the Kundalini
or do anything,

29:51.808 --> 29:57.844
everything will work out smoothly and
nicely and nobody should stand up.

29:58.045 --> 30:01.159
Everybody should be seated, whichever way
you like.

30:01.360 --> 30:09.356
That's important because as I said this is
the gravity, to settle down, to settle down.

30:09.557 --> 30:16.905
That's very important, as we call Gruhastha
means the one who settles in the household

30:17.106 --> 30:22.593
is the Gruhastha or we call it in Indian
language as the baithak,

30:22.794 --> 30:29.418
is the sitting capacity, how much you can
sit down on things.

30:32.145 --> 30:35.334
This child, you better ask the child to go
away. Whose child is this one?

30:35.535 --> 30:39.583
Is very disturbing… one second to that
child, yes.

30:39.784 --> 30:43.534
Just speak him up, that’s all, he’s
the disturbing one … I don't know...

30:43.735 --> 30:49.184
Let him sit outside, then he will be
alright. He’s alright.

30:49.385 --> 30:52.225
Sometimes something goes wrong with
them, you see…

30:52.426 --> 30:57.905
These two girls - they should pay
attention. Children should not...

30:58.106 --> 31:01.061
These two girls there - they should pay
attention, that’s important,

31:01.262 --> 31:06.441
because that’s how they are going to be
helped.

31:07.856 --> 31:16.983
Now for the puja, Arneau if you come here,
I’ll be happy, because… Arneau?

31:17.184 --> 31:23.010
I’ll tell you how, what to do about these
musicians.

31:23.211 --> 31:26.984
So let the musicians join that side all
of them who have to sing,

31:27.185 --> 31:33.987
for the puja mantras and everything. You
come so you can guide them.

31:34.188 --> 31:36.990
(To the pujari) Now you have to get people
from Barcelona (?).
