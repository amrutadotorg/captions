WEBVTT

01:55.607 --> 01:59.647
Wish you a very very happy Diwali!

02:04.167 --> 02:07.607
To see all of you here

02:07.767 --> 02:13.807
is itself such a joy for Me

02:15.647 --> 02:22.327
that you all have taken to Sahaja Yoga

02:22.567 --> 02:25.487
in such a beautiful way.

02:26.527 --> 02:29.487
It’s your own,

02:30.167 --> 02:32.767
Self is your own,

02:32.927 --> 02:36.047
Spirit is your own.

02:37.127 --> 02:43.887
But ‘to take to Self’ is difficult.

02:44.367 --> 02:50.687
It’s only your desires, I think,

02:50.847 --> 02:54.087
which is being fulfilled.

02:54.247 --> 02:58.967
And that’s how you have got

02:59.127 --> 03:01.967
your Self-Realization.

03:02.127 --> 03:06.647
It cannot be forced, as you have known very well.

03:07.047 --> 03:12.767
It has to work out only with ‘your’ desire,

03:12.927 --> 03:22.167
only with ‘your’ surrendering.

03:37.167 --> 03:43.367
No use talking about it,

03:47.567 --> 03:52.847
no use convincing about it,

03:53.007 --> 03:56.167
what works out is your desire

03:56.327 --> 04:00.967
simple as that.

04:02.807 --> 04:08.127
The power of desire within you works it out.

04:08.287 --> 04:14.207
There are many who are not here,

04:15.487 --> 04:20.407
who have got their Realization all over the world.

04:20.567 --> 04:23.727
I remember all of them

04:25.127 --> 04:31.887
and all of you should remember them.

04:33.447 --> 04:36.807
Today is a nice day,

04:36.967 --> 04:41.167
when we can think

04:41.327 --> 04:45.447
of all those who are enlightened

04:45.607 --> 04:47.687
in this world.

04:48.647 --> 04:52.127
That’s the real Diwali:

04:52.527 --> 04:56.847
the enlightenment of human beings.

04:57.007 --> 05:03.127
Is not candle, is not some lamp,

05:03.287 --> 05:05.567
is human beings.

05:05.727 --> 05:09.447
If they are enlightened,

05:10.447 --> 05:14.927
then there’s no problem anymore left.

05:15.087 --> 05:19.767
The problems come with the people who are not enlightened.

05:19.927 --> 05:22.847
Because they are in the darkness,

05:23.007 --> 05:26.287
they are groping in the darkness

05:26.447 --> 05:29.687
and some of them are don’t know also that

05:29.847 --> 05:38.087
they are completely ignorant of realities.

05:38.767 --> 05:45.767
Once you come to Sahaja Yog

05:47.087 --> 05:50.847
and enlighten your Self,

05:51.007 --> 05:54.727
you ‘see’ in that light,

05:55.927 --> 06:02.487
in that light, what’s is good and what is bad

06:02.647 --> 06:05.087
to begin with.

06:05.247 --> 06:10.047
And then you grow into it beautifully,

06:10.767 --> 06:14.127
just like these flowers,

06:15.007 --> 06:18.927
who are all the time happy,

06:19.847 --> 06:23.647
all the time giving you joy.

06:23.807 --> 06:29.847
In the same way, when you are enlightened,

06:30.727 --> 06:37.487
with that light you don’t seek anything.

06:38.047 --> 06:43.167
You got everything, within you.

06:43.847 --> 06:49.327
Keep the lights on.

06:50.327 --> 06:53.527
But the another thing you can do is:

06:53.687 --> 06:57.687
with your light you can enlighten other people

06:57.847 --> 07:00.327
like we have done here,

07:00.487 --> 07:02.967
we had enlightened one candle,

07:03.127 --> 07:06.327
with that we have enlightened all of them.

07:06.487 --> 07:09.047
So you all can do it, because

07:09.207 --> 07:12.927
you have got that light within you.

07:13.087 --> 07:17.927
With that light, you can enlighten others

07:18.087 --> 07:24.247
and they can feel their joy of their Spirit.

07:26.007 --> 07:31.087
Is something to be seen now,

07:31.247 --> 07:35.767
like so many lights you have put.

07:37.767 --> 07:42.687
In the same way, ‘you’ are the lights

07:42.847 --> 07:45.847
for the whole world.

07:46.047 --> 07:51.367
Is not sufficient that you have got the light,

07:51.527 --> 07:57.167
but also you have to give light to others,

07:57.327 --> 08:02.287
you have to enlighten others, just like these candles.

08:02.447 --> 08:04.887
Once you start doing that,

08:05.047 --> 08:08.967
you will realize what you have got.

08:09.127 --> 08:11.967
And then you will respect your Self.

08:12.127 --> 08:18.607
And you will behave in a manner that behooves a saint,

08:18.767 --> 08:21.847
could be a sage

08:22.047 --> 08:26.327
without proclaiming anything.

08:26.847 --> 08:33.647
Inside your being you just develop that beautiful,

08:34.047 --> 08:41.687
extremely beautiful temperament that is joy giving.

08:43.047 --> 08:49.967
You don’t want to give any false ideas about yourself.

08:50.127 --> 08:54.247
Because, whatever is the truth, is with you.

08:54.407 --> 09:03.207
There’s no need to tell something untruth about yourself.

09:03.367 --> 09:09.127
People will realize that you are realized souls,

09:09.567 --> 09:17.767
they will just feel your subtle nature,

09:17.927 --> 09:19.327
your reality.

09:19.487 --> 09:24.807
Whether you come from India,

09:24.967 --> 09:34.127
or you come from England, or from America,

09:35.247 --> 09:43.327
you all have that ocean of love and knowledge within you.

09:43.487 --> 09:48.407
Be sure that is all there,

09:48.567 --> 09:54.767
only you first enjoy your own ocean of love.

09:55.007 --> 09:58.487
First you enjoy that

09:58.647 --> 10:02.487
and then you can enjoy in others also.

10:02.647 --> 10:04.967
I don’t have to tell you

10:05.127 --> 10:07.447
that “You love each other” or anything

10:07.607 --> 10:13.847
you just love, you just understand,

10:14.047 --> 10:19.127
you just spread your light among yourself.

10:20.047 --> 10:23.007
Sometimes you get frustrated

10:23.167 --> 10:26.127
with other people

10:26.967 --> 10:29.007
in your country, may be in your city,

10:29.167 --> 10:31.407
may be in your village

10:31.567 --> 10:36.007
that the people who are not yet enlightened.

10:36.967 --> 10:40.887
But best thing is to work it out,

10:41.047 --> 10:44.327
you have to work it out.

10:44.487 --> 10:48.047
You know, I had first one lady,

10:48.207 --> 10:52.487
very old lady one, who got her Realization from Me.

10:52.647 --> 10:55.607
And then, you all are here.

10:55.767 --> 10:59.927
In the same way you all can also

11:00.687 --> 11:05.007
do the job of Realization.

11:05.167 --> 11:08.647
For that you don’t need any calculations,

11:08.807 --> 11:12.447
you don’t need any thanksgiving

11:12.607 --> 11:16.487
it’s just there and it works out.

11:17.127 --> 11:21.167
What do you do for a light? - just see.

11:21.327 --> 11:25.767
You just put near the candle and you get the light.

11:25.927 --> 11:28.367
In the same way it is,

11:28.527 --> 11:31.207
your enlightenment is such

11:31.367 --> 11:33.767
that it will give

11:33.927 --> 11:39.967
light to thousands and thousands of people all over the world.

11:40.127 --> 11:43.607
As you know, there are many countries

11:43.767 --> 11:46.767
whom we have to still approach.

11:46.927 --> 11:49.847
But, we will do that.

11:50.007 --> 11:52.687
Just locate and find out

11:52.847 --> 11:54.967
where do you have to go

11:55.127 --> 11:58.887
and where you have to work.

12:00.127 --> 12:04.407
Firstly, you are capable of giving Realization,

12:04.567 --> 12:06.167
you are.

12:06.327 --> 12:08.127
Have confidence,

12:08.287 --> 12:11.447
that you can give Realization to people.

12:11.607 --> 12:16.487
For which you don’t need any help,

12:16.647 --> 12:21.727
single person can do it, thousands can do it.

12:21.847 --> 12:26.527
Is very important for the Diwali of the whole world

12:26.687 --> 12:31.927
that we should give Realization to people.

12:32.087 --> 12:35.287
Very important.

12:35.447 --> 12:41.607
Now, in Sahaj Yoga, many people are such

12:41.767 --> 12:45.367
who are little frustrated with themselves,

12:45.527 --> 12:47.447
specially with their past.

12:47.607 --> 12:49.727
Forget the past!

12:49.847 --> 12:54.607
Past is not important, what is important is present.

12:54.767 --> 13:00.167
At this present moment, what have you to do?

13:00.327 --> 13:03.447
You don’t have to worry about the past,

13:03.607 --> 13:05.567
that “I’ve done this, I’ve done that”

13:05.727 --> 13:07.567
what’s done is finished.

13:07.727 --> 13:12.007
Now you look out for the future.

13:12.167 --> 13:15.167
What can you do for the future.

13:15.327 --> 13:18.847
And some or other, with the light

13:19.007 --> 13:22.207
you see your path,

13:22.367 --> 13:25.687
you get rid of all the darkness

13:25.847 --> 13:29.407
and you know how far to go,

13:29.567 --> 13:32.087
how to reach people

13:32.247 --> 13:34.927
and how to spread Sahaj Yog.

13:35.087 --> 13:40.367
It’s something you have already within you,

13:40.527 --> 13:43.727
but you have to first of all

13:43.887 --> 13:46.767
establish your connection with it.

13:46.927 --> 13:49.127
If you have established your connection

13:49.287 --> 13:52.487
with that ocean that you have,

13:52.847 --> 13:55.767
you can definitely work it out,

13:55.927 --> 13:59.647
work it out in such a beautiful manner

13:59.807 --> 14:03.567
and you’ll be amazed how you’ll be successful.

14:03.847 --> 14:10.247
The success that you get out of all this ignorance,

14:10.407 --> 14:12.807
you are amazed at it.

14:12.967 --> 14:15.487
But you have the light.

14:15.647 --> 14:19.847
With the light you do remove all the darkness.

14:20.007 --> 14:21.607
Doesn’t have to think about it,

14:21.767 --> 14:24.687
just removes, because you have the light.

14:24.847 --> 14:28.087
But if you don’t have the light,

14:28.247 --> 14:31.967
then, no use talking about it.

14:32.127 --> 14:36.327
No use doing it, because,

14:36.487 --> 14:41.167
it doesn’t give any success.

14:41.327 --> 14:44.327
On the contrary, it’s a failure,

14:44.487 --> 14:46.687
failure of the worst type.

14:46.847 --> 14:51.047
And can be very dangerous for people.

14:54.327 --> 15:00.127
We have had very funny experiences also in the Sahaja Yoga.

15:00.287 --> 15:05.807
But, I think they all are learning one by one:

15:05.967 --> 15:08.087
that this should not have been done,

15:08.247 --> 15:10.447
that was wrong.

15:10.607 --> 15:15.807
Now, what blinds you we should find out.

15:15.967 --> 15:20.567
In this country, it’s such a money oriented country America is,

15:20.727 --> 15:23.527
which has spread all over the world.

15:23.687 --> 15:31.247
And being money oriented, you do get enamored,

15:31.407 --> 15:36.887
you do feel that you must make money out of Sahaj Yoga.

15:37.047 --> 15:40.167
There are some who do not think like that,

15:40.327 --> 15:44.607
but they are still running after making money.

15:44.767 --> 15:48.527
There is no need at all for you to make money

15:48.687 --> 15:55.487
or to find for yourself a kind of a security in money.

15:55.647 --> 16:00.447
Your security is inbuilt within you.

16:00.807 --> 16:09.367
So, all these outside things which are absolutely unnecessary

16:09.527 --> 16:13.007
should not blind you.

16:13.167 --> 16:16.887
Now, if you have the light, you can see it clearly.

16:17.047 --> 16:20.687
And this help of the Divine,

16:20.847 --> 16:24.127
you see that very clearly in your life

16:24.287 --> 16:26.367
and you are surprised

16:26.527 --> 16:30.287
how the Divine has helped you at different points.

16:30.447 --> 16:34.687
I get letters from people who say:

16:34.847 --> 16:36.927
“Mother, thank You very much,

16:37.087 --> 16:42.167
I got rid of my problem, I got rid of my enemies”,

16:42.327 --> 16:45.407
all kinds of things.

16:45.567 --> 16:47.927
While I have done nothing.

16:48.087 --> 16:53.087
It’s your light which has removed the darkness.

16:53.247 --> 16:55.567
If you are ignorant,

16:55.727 --> 16:59.047
then only the light can remove the darkness

16:59.207 --> 17:01.727
of your ignorance also.

17:01.847 --> 17:08.287
Actually, we don’t know how much

17:08.447 --> 17:12.007
there is the power of the light.

17:12.167 --> 17:14.527
As you can see here,

17:14.687 --> 17:21.527
every light is giving such a lot of,

17:21.687 --> 17:27.567
not only energy, but also complete picture.

17:27.847 --> 17:31.687
So thus you can make out,

17:31.847 --> 17:37.447
for example you can make out if somebody is a realized soul or not.

17:37.607 --> 17:39.887
Is not necessary

17:40.047 --> 17:42.887
that you have to go near that person

17:43.047 --> 17:47.727
or take any special care or anything.

17:47.887 --> 17:53.927
You will just know that this person is a realized soul or not.

17:54.087 --> 17:57.647
I’ve had many such experiences,

17:57.807 --> 18:04.607
where I found that people don’t know who is a realized soul,

18:04.767 --> 18:08.167
it’s very surprising.

18:08.327 --> 18:12.007
If you know who is a realized soul,

18:12.167 --> 18:16.247
then half of your problem is over.

18:16.607 --> 18:19.727
Now, the second one is the problem

18:19.887 --> 18:23.607
of how to convince that fellow

18:23.767 --> 18:27.407
what he is capable of doing.

18:27.567 --> 18:31.367
I find that problem also with Sahaja Yogis.

18:31.967 --> 18:38.047
They are capable of very great work

18:38.207 --> 18:40.687
all over the world,

18:40.847 --> 18:45.047
they can find out so many things,

18:45.207 --> 18:52.247
which normally, normal people cannot find out.

18:52.407 --> 18:57.247
But, Sahaja Yogis can immediately find out

18:57.407 --> 19:02.567
what sort of a person they are facing.

19:02.727 --> 19:04.247
This is the difference.

19:04.407 --> 19:06.887
That means you know the truth.

19:07.047 --> 19:09.607
Truth about everyone,

19:09.767 --> 19:13.767
truth about the whole situation.

19:13.927 --> 19:20.847
Truth about who is just boasting,

19:21.047 --> 19:24.407
or just making up a story,

19:24.567 --> 19:26.647
or some sort of a hypocrisy.

19:26.807 --> 19:31.047
It’s not difficult, because now you have the sight.

19:31.207 --> 19:34.167
You can see with your light

19:34.327 --> 19:39.207
what’s wrong or what’s good with others.

19:39.367 --> 19:42.487
Such a blessing it is for you,

19:42.647 --> 19:46.807
that you cannot be cheated.

19:46.967 --> 19:55.287
Because also, you are looked after by the Divine,

19:55.447 --> 19:58.927
guided all the time by the Divine.

19:59.087 --> 20:01.447
Have faith in the Divine,

20:01.607 --> 20:03.767
have faith in the Divine!

20:03.927 --> 20:06.447
That’s very important.

20:06.607 --> 20:09.927
As you have faith in a candle,

20:10.087 --> 20:15.607
have faith that the Divine will give you the light,

20:15.767 --> 20:18.407
will guide your path,

20:18.567 --> 20:22.207
will take you to right place

20:22.367 --> 20:24.487
to do the right things!

20:24.647 --> 20:27.807
I mean so many of these experiences are with you.

20:27.967 --> 20:32.647
I need not tell you how much people have written to Me,

20:32.807 --> 20:37.447
how they found things working out.

20:37.607 --> 20:43.207
Despite all that, we are collective,

20:43.367 --> 20:47.287
we are nice to each other,

20:47.447 --> 20:50.727
we don’t tell lies,

20:50.847 --> 20:55.527
we don’t try to destroy anyone.

20:55.687 --> 21:00.367
That means we are much above all human failings.

21:00.527 --> 21:04.167
And this is only because of the light.

21:04.327 --> 21:07.847
You can see where you are faltering.

21:08.007 --> 21:12.967
It’s just you see for yourself.

21:13.127 --> 21:15.487
For that, I think,

21:15.647 --> 21:20.407
meditation is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

21:20.567 --> 21:23.967
Everyday you should do meditation.

21:24.127 --> 21:27.487
Those who do not do meditation

21:27.647 --> 21:31.527
are capable of falling down.

21:31.687 --> 21:39.207
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

21:39.367 --> 21:43.767
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

21:43.927 --> 21:46.287
are sadly mistaken.

21:46.447 --> 21:52.767
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

21:52.967 --> 21:57.687
The problem is everything comes so handy,

21:57.847 --> 22:00.007
so simple,

22:00.167 --> 22:04.807
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

22:04.967 --> 22:07.447
Maybe .

22:07.607 --> 22:12.047
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

22:12.207 --> 22:15.367
who don’t meditate.

22:15.527 --> 22:22.087
And their style is different,

22:22.247 --> 22:25.167
their nature is different.

22:25.327 --> 22:27.847
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

22:28.007 --> 22:36.207
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

22:36.367 --> 22:40.327
that all your problems get solved

22:40.487 --> 22:43.607
in that meditative mood.

22:43.767 --> 22:47.407
If you are not meditating,

22:47.567 --> 22:51.607
you are not following meditation,

22:51.767 --> 22:54.767
then maybe your light will go down,

22:54.927 --> 22:58.447
it won’t give sufficient light.

23:02.207 --> 23:05.407
Is important, very important,

23:06.247 --> 23:11.447
to find out about yourself, about others

23:11.607 --> 23:14.607
in the meditation.

23:14.767 --> 23:18.967
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

23:19.127 --> 23:21.447
Don’t do anything

23:21.607 --> 23:25.287
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

23:25.447 --> 23:28.207
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

23:28.367 --> 23:34.247
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

23:34.407 --> 23:36.687
you’ve done your job.

23:36.847 --> 23:39.287
Because that’s the point where

23:39.447 --> 23:43.967
you are with the truth, with the reality,

23:44.127 --> 23:45.527
with the joy,

23:45.687 --> 23:49.887
with everything that is so fundamental.

23:50.047 --> 23:54.087
When you meditate, try not to,

23:54.247 --> 24:01.007
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

24:01.167 --> 24:05.407
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

24:05.567 --> 24:10.607
silencing your thoughts and the going

24:10.767 --> 24:15.007
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

24:15.167 --> 24:19.167
But supposing you don’t do that.

24:19.327 --> 24:21.287
If you don’t meditate,

24:21.447 --> 24:23.967
I can make out immediately

24:24.127 --> 24:27.047
those who are meditating and those who are not

24:27.207 --> 24:29.767
It’s not difficult for Me.

24:29.927 --> 24:34.567
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

24:35.487 --> 24:40.767
they are confused, they can’t understand.

24:40.927 --> 24:44.847
And that’s why meditation

24:45.007 --> 24:49.247
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

24:49.407 --> 24:53.127
Just like a light burns,

24:53.287 --> 24:56.447
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

24:56.607 --> 25:00.487
or by, because of the candles,

25:00.647 --> 25:04.047
in the same way meditation

25:04.207 --> 25:13.127
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

25:13.327 --> 25:17.447
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

25:17.607 --> 25:19.487
Not only that,

25:19.647 --> 25:24.007
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

25:24.167 --> 25:30.247
it takes out all the discouraging things.

25:30.407 --> 25:34.447
And when you are meditating like that,

25:34.607 --> 25:37.487
thoughtless awareness,

25:37.647 --> 25:42.087
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

25:42.247 --> 25:46.407
from within and without.

25:46.567 --> 25:49.527
It’s a terrible power that works,

25:49.687 --> 25:52.207
this thoughtless awareness.

25:52.367 --> 25:56.687
So those who do not meditate

25:56.847 --> 25:59.447
cannot go very much far

25:59.607 --> 26:03.127
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

26:03.287 --> 26:06.447
One should try to meditate

26:06.607 --> 26:11.167
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

26:11.887 --> 26:15.167
So, what happens to you?

26:15.327 --> 26:18.527
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

26:18.687 --> 26:21.207
what happens to you?

26:21.367 --> 26:29.207
Is that you get the confidence,

26:29.367 --> 26:34.567
complete confidence of Divinity,

26:35.727 --> 26:40.007
you know you have that.

26:40.167 --> 26:44.327
I’ve seen children coming from our school in Dharamsala:

26:44.487 --> 26:50.527
extremely confident and extremely humble.

26:50.687 --> 26:53.207
And I asked them: “What do you do?”

26:53.367 --> 26:57.807
They said: “Mother, we meditate.

26:57.967 --> 27:05.607
We meditate in the school in the evening

27:05.767 --> 27:08.687
and that meditation helps.”

27:08.847 --> 27:12.127
Imagine these small children can say that,

27:12.287 --> 27:15.727
so why not you also understand

27:15.887 --> 27:19.607
that meditation will give you security,

27:19.767 --> 27:23.727
it will give you real enlightenment

27:23.927 --> 27:28.687
and a complete connection with the Divine.

27:28.847 --> 27:33.207
Without the connection of the Divine,

27:33.367 --> 27:36.967
what’s the use of doing Sahaj Yoga?

27:45.807 --> 27:52.767
I know the people who are meditating,

27:53.367 --> 27:56.727
who have gone down into their being

27:56.847 --> 27:59.967
and who are very developed.

28:00.127 --> 28:04.287
Also I know people who are little superficial.

28:04.487 --> 28:08.247
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

28:08.407 --> 28:13.367
Is a very important point which you should reach.

28:13.527 --> 28:19.287
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

28:19.447 --> 28:23.407
then you really become reflective about it,

28:23.567 --> 28:28.607
just works out that way.

28:28.767 --> 28:34.047
I don’t know how far you can remain in that condition.

28:34.207 --> 28:38.327
But even for a second you can achieve it,

28:38.487 --> 28:41.967
you’ll start achieving it more and more.

28:42.127 --> 28:45.327
I’ve talked so much about meditation before,

28:45.487 --> 28:50.927
but today when I see all these candles burning,

28:51.087 --> 28:54.407
I think they are all meditative,

28:54.567 --> 28:57.247
they are all in meditation

28:57.407 --> 29:00.607
and that’s how they are burning.

29:00.767 --> 29:06.367
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who meditate, I know,

29:06.527 --> 29:08.887
and those who don’t, I know.

29:09.047 --> 29:10.887
And if they have problems,

29:11.047 --> 29:14.167
I know why the problems are there.

29:14.327 --> 29:17.447
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

29:17.607 --> 29:21.567
is only possible when you meditate

29:21.727 --> 29:25.087
and become thoughtlessly aware.

29:25.247 --> 29:31.367
That’s the point where Divine works.

29:31.527 --> 29:33.647
It helps you.

29:33.807 --> 29:39.087
It comes to your help in such a way

29:39.247 --> 29:44.247
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

29:44.407 --> 29:48.687
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

29:48.847 --> 29:51.647
all of you should achieve.

29:51.807 --> 29:54.007
Very important.

29:54.167 --> 29:59.127
After that you can achieve something else,

29:59.287 --> 30:03.207
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

30:03.367 --> 30:10.207
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

30:10.367 --> 30:13.847
because then there are no thoughts coming

30:14.007 --> 30:19.327
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

30:19.487 --> 30:24.327
Just in the present you are there.

30:24.487 --> 30:28.847
Is something you all have, is not that

30:29.007 --> 30:31.167
Me, I’m saying that to you,

30:31.327 --> 30:33.407
but all of you have this.

30:33.567 --> 30:35.367
But ‘steady yourself’!

30:35.527 --> 30:40.047
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

30:40.207 --> 30:42.687
How long, that’s not the point.

30:42.847 --> 30:45.407
The point is once you touched it,

30:45.567 --> 30:47.927
you’ll go on touching it.

30:48.087 --> 30:54.887
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

30:55.047 --> 31:00.447
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

31:00.607 --> 31:05.367
Now this is the one point which is very important.

31:05.527 --> 31:08.007
If you have to grow,

31:08.167 --> 31:11.647
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

31:11.807 --> 31:14.167
through thoughtless awareness.

31:14.327 --> 31:16.167
You don’t have to pray,

31:16.327 --> 31:18.767
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

31:18.927 --> 31:21.807
it just works because it is within you.

31:21.967 --> 31:24.127
All these thoughts are bombarding

31:24.287 --> 31:27.207
from both the sides in your mind.

31:27.367 --> 31:30.007
These thoughts that are coming to you

31:30.167 --> 31:32.847
have no meaning with you,

31:33.007 --> 31:35.927
they do not substantiate.

31:36.087 --> 31:39.247
Yourself you are an ocean

31:39.407 --> 31:45.847
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

31:46.007 --> 31:50.967
It is always described in all the great books,

31:51.127 --> 31:54.687
but not so clearly as I am telling you.

31:54.847 --> 31:59.207
I don’t say that some of you do not get thoughtless awareness,

31:59.367 --> 32:01.487
so they are good for nothing, no.

32:01.647 --> 32:06.967
But, please try, you can all get into that state

32:07.127 --> 32:09.007
of thoughtless awareness.

32:09.167 --> 32:12.327
Even for a second if you get it,

32:12.487 --> 32:14.367
it’s a very good idea.

32:14.527 --> 32:20.207
Then you go on increasing that second.

32:21.487 --> 32:27.887
I think is a reflecting mind.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.447
When you look at something,

32:32.967 --> 32:36.807
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

32:37.447 --> 32:42.567
And then this mind reflects

32:43.007 --> 32:48.447
to the depth of what you see.

32:48.607 --> 32:51.607
That’s how you all will become really

32:51.767 --> 32:54.847
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

32:55.007 --> 33:03.687
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

33:03.847 --> 33:08.007
is not established by many, which is not good.

33:08.167 --> 33:11.887
Today on this day of Diwali, I would say that:

33:12.047 --> 33:17.407
“You enlighten your Self with thoughtless awareness!”

33:17.567 --> 33:20.927
It is not difficult, is within you.

33:21.087 --> 33:24.967
Because thoughts are coming from this side and that side.

33:25.127 --> 33:29.647
And they are not the waves of your brain, no,

33:29.807 --> 33:32.407
just your own reactions.

33:32.567 --> 33:39.567
But, in case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

33:39.727 --> 33:43.247
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

33:43.407 --> 33:46.767
Which is a very important point

33:46.927 --> 33:50.247
and all these nonsensical thoughts,

33:50.407 --> 33:55.647
which are of no use to you, will disappear.

33:55.807 --> 34:01.367
They won’t be there and then your growth is possible

34:01.527 --> 34:04.807
and you’ll grow very well.

34:04.967 --> 34:08.127
Many people are here, who will say:

34:08.287 --> 34:10.527
“Mother, we don’t get that state.”

34:10.687 --> 34:12.847
Try,

34:13.007 --> 34:14.847
try that!

34:15.047 --> 34:18.247
I don’t believe you cannot get it.

34:18.407 --> 34:22.087
All of you can get that thought

34:22.247 --> 34:25.607
that “I can get it”, and you will get it.

34:25.767 --> 34:33.527
In that you don’t have to discard anything,

34:33.687 --> 34:40.567
you don’t have to see anything, just go into meditation

34:40.727 --> 34:44.687
and you’ll be amazed how it will work.

34:44.847 --> 34:48.447
Of course you are very much there, most of you,

34:48.607 --> 34:51.087
but still, I would say,

34:51.247 --> 34:58.207
increase that thoughtless awareness, that area!

34:58.367 --> 35:04.447
Today is very important because of this day of Diwali.

35:04.607 --> 35:10.127
Diwali is supposed to be enlightenment day.

35:10.287 --> 35:15.247
But enlightenment within is:

35:15.407 --> 35:19.807
how much you are in thoughtless awareness?

35:19.967 --> 35:22.327
And the everything works out,

35:22.487 --> 35:26.367
because you are the ocean of it,

35:26.527 --> 35:28.927
you have it within yourself.

35:29.087 --> 35:31.687
Only you have to tap it.

35:31.847 --> 35:34.447
If you don’t tap it,

35:34.607 --> 35:37.567
then it doesn’t work out.

35:37.727 --> 35:40.167
You have to just tap it

35:40.327 --> 35:45.847
and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,

35:46.047 --> 35:51.407
source of such happiness,

35:51.567 --> 35:56.167
I should say, source of real enlightenment.

35:56.327 --> 35:59.847
So, today’s message is that:

36:00.047 --> 36:05.607
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

36:05.767 --> 36:09.207
No thought is important,

36:09.367 --> 36:12.527
because it’s your own creation.

36:12.687 --> 36:17.047
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

36:17.207 --> 36:21.447
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

36:21.607 --> 36:24.127
minimum of minimum.

36:24.287 --> 36:27.807
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

36:27.967 --> 36:30.807
and you’ll be amazed how

36:30.967 --> 36:36.007
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

36:36.207 --> 36:38.807
Thank you very much!
