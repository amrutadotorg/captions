00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:59.647
Wish you a very very happy Diwali!

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:07.607
To see all of you here

00:02:07.767 --> 00:02:13.807
is itself such a joy for Me

00:02:15.647 --> 00:02:22.327
that you all have taken to Sahaja Yoga

00:02:22.567 --> 00:02:25.487
in such a beautiful way.

00:02:26.527 --> 00:02:29.487
It’s your own,

00:02:30.167 --> 00:02:32.767
Self is your own,

00:02:32.927 --> 00:02:36.047
Spirit is your own.

00:02:37.127 --> 00:02:43.887
But ‘to take to Self’ is difficult.

00:02:44.367 --> 00:02:50.687
It’s only your desires, I think,

00:02:50.847 --> 00:02:54.087
which is being fulfilled.

00:02:54.247 --> 00:02:58.967
And that’s how you have got

00:02:59.127 --> 00:03:01.967
your Self-Realization.

00:03:02.127 --> 00:03:06.647
It cannot be forced, as you have known very well.

00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:12.767
It has to work out only with ‘your’ desire,

00:03:12.927 --> 00:03:22.167
only with ‘your’ surrendering.

00:03:37.167 --> 00:03:43.367
No use talking about it,

00:03:47.567 --> 00:03:52.847
no use convincing about it,

00:03:53.007 --> 00:03:56.167
what works out is your desire

00:03:56.327 --> 00:04:00.967
simple as that.

00:04:02.807 --> 00:04:08.127
The power of desire within you works it out.

00:04:08.287 --> 00:04:14.207
There are many who are not here,

00:04:15.487 --> 00:04:20.407
who have got their Realization all over the world.

00:04:20.567 --> 00:04:23.727
I remember all of them

00:04:25.127 --> 00:04:31.887
and all of you should remember them.

00:04:33.447 --> 00:04:36.807
Today is a nice day,

00:04:36.967 --> 00:04:41.167
when we can think

00:04:41.327 --> 00:04:45.447
of all those who are enlightened

00:04:45.607 --> 00:04:47.687
in this world.

00:04:48.647 --> 00:04:52.127
That’s the real Diwali:

00:04:52.527 --> 00:04:56.847
the enlightenment of human beings.

00:04:57.007 --> 00:05:03.127
Is not candle, is not some lamp,

00:05:03.287 --> 00:05:05.567
is human beings.

00:05:05.727 --> 00:05:09.447
If they are enlightened,

00:05:10.447 --> 00:05:14.927
then there’s no problem anymore left.

00:05:15.087 --> 00:05:19.767
The problems come with the people who are not enlightened.

00:05:19.927 --> 00:05:22.847
Because they are in the darkness,

00:05:23.007 --> 00:05:26.287
they are groping in the darkness

00:05:26.447 --> 00:05:29.687
and some of them are don’t know also that

00:05:29.847 --> 00:05:38.087
they are completely ignorant of realities.

00:05:38.767 --> 00:05:45.767
Once you come to Sahaja Yog

00:05:47.087 --> 00:05:50.847
and enlighten your Self,

00:05:51.007 --> 00:05:54.727
you ‘see’ in that light,

00:05:55.927 --> 00:06:02.487
in that light, what’s is good and what is bad

00:06:02.647 --> 00:06:05.087
to begin with.

00:06:05.247 --> 00:06:10.047
And then you grow into it beautifully,

00:06:10.767 --> 00:06:14.127
just like these flowers,

00:06:15.007 --> 00:06:18.927
who are all the time happy,

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:23.647
all the time giving you joy.

00:06:23.807 --> 00:06:29.847
In the same way, when you are enlightened,

00:06:30.727 --> 00:06:37.487
with that light you don’t seek anything.

00:06:38.047 --> 00:06:43.167
You got everything, within you.

00:06:43.847 --> 00:06:49.327
Keep the lights on.

00:06:50.327 --> 00:06:53.527
But the another thing you can do is:

00:06:53.687 --> 00:06:57.687
with your light you can enlighten other people

00:06:57.847 --> 00:07:00.327
like we have done here,

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.967
we had enlightened one candle,

00:07:03.127 --> 00:07:06.327
with that we have enlightened all of them.

00:07:06.487 --> 00:07:09.047
So you all can do it, because

00:07:09.207 --> 00:07:12.927
you have got that light within you.

00:07:13.087 --> 00:07:17.927
With that light, you can enlighten others

00:07:18.087 --> 00:07:24.247
and they can feel their joy of their Spirit.

00:07:26.007 --> 00:07:31.087
Is something to be seen now,

00:07:31.247 --> 00:07:35.767
like so many lights you have put.

00:07:37.767 --> 00:07:42.687
In the same way, ‘you’ are the lights

00:07:42.847 --> 00:07:45.847
for the whole world.

00:07:46.047 --> 00:07:51.367
Is not sufficient that you have got the light,

00:07:51.527 --> 00:07:57.167
but also you have to give light to others,

00:07:57.327 --> 00:08:02.287
you have to enlighten others, just like these candles.

00:08:02.447 --> 00:08:04.887
Once you start doing that,

00:08:05.047 --> 00:08:08.967
you will realize what you have got.

00:08:09.127 --> 00:08:11.967
And then you will respect your Self.

00:08:12.127 --> 00:08:18.607
And you will behave in a manner that behooves a saint,

00:08:18.767 --> 00:08:21.847
could be a sage

00:08:22.047 --> 00:08:26.327
without proclaiming anything.

00:08:26.847 --> 00:08:33.647
Inside your being you just develop that beautiful,

00:08:34.047 --> 00:08:41.687
extremely beautiful temperament that is joy giving.

00:08:43.047 --> 00:08:49.967
You don’t want to give any false ideas about yourself.

00:08:50.127 --> 00:08:54.247
Because, whatever is the truth, is with you.

00:08:54.407 --> 00:09:03.207
There’s no need to tell something untruth about yourself.

00:09:03.367 --> 00:09:09.127
People will realize that you are realized souls,

00:09:09.567 --> 00:09:17.767
they will just feel your subtle nature,

00:09:17.927 --> 00:09:19.327
your reality.

00:09:19.487 --> 00:09:24.807
Whether you come from India,

00:09:24.967 --> 00:09:34.127
or you come from England, or from America,

00:09:35.247 --> 00:09:43.327
you all have that ocean of love and knowledge within you.

00:09:43.487 --> 00:09:48.407
Be sure that is all there,

00:09:48.567 --> 00:09:54.767
only you first enjoy your own ocean of love.

00:09:55.007 --> 00:09:58.487
First you enjoy that

00:09:58.647 --> 00:10:02.487
and then you can enjoy in others also.

00:10:02.647 --> 00:10:04.967
I don’t have to tell you

00:10:05.127 --> 00:10:07.447
that “You love each other” or anything

00:10:07.607 --> 00:10:13.847
you just love, you just understand,

00:10:14.047 --> 00:10:19.127
you just spread your light among yourself.

00:10:20.047 --> 00:10:23.007
Sometimes you get frustrated

00:10:23.167 --> 00:10:26.127
with other people

00:10:26.967 --> 00:10:29.007
in your country, may be in your city,

00:10:29.167 --> 00:10:31.407
may be in your village

00:10:31.567 --> 00:10:36.007
that the people who are not yet enlightened.

00:10:36.967 --> 00:10:40.887
But best thing is to work it out,

00:10:41.047 --> 00:10:44.327
you have to work it out.

00:10:44.487 --> 00:10:48.047
You know, I had first one lady,

00:10:48.207 --> 00:10:52.487
very old lady one, who got her Realization from Me.

00:10:52.647 --> 00:10:55.607
And then, you all are here.

00:10:55.767 --> 00:10:59.927
In the same way you all can also

00:11:00.687 --> 00:11:05.007
do the job of Realization.

00:11:05.167 --> 00:11:08.647
For that you don’t need any calculations,

00:11:08.807 --> 00:11:12.447
you don’t need any thanksgiving

00:11:12.607 --> 00:11:16.487
it’s just there and it works out.

00:11:17.127 --> 00:11:21.167
What do you do for a light? - just see.

00:11:21.327 --> 00:11:25.767
You just put near the candle and you get the light.

00:11:25.927 --> 00:11:28.367
In the same way it is,

00:11:28.527 --> 00:11:31.207
your enlightenment is such

00:11:31.367 --> 00:11:33.767
that it will give

00:11:33.927 --> 00:11:39.967
light to thousands and thousands of people all over the world.

00:11:40.127 --> 00:11:43.607
As you know, there are many countries

00:11:43.767 --> 00:11:46.767
whom we have to still approach.

00:11:46.927 --> 00:11:49.847
But, we will do that.

00:11:50.007 --> 00:11:52.687
Just locate and find out

00:11:52.847 --> 00:11:54.967
where do you have to go

00:11:55.127 --> 00:11:58.887
and where you have to work.

00:12:00.127 --> 00:12:04.407
Firstly, you are capable of giving Realization,

00:12:04.567 --> 00:12:06.167
you are.

00:12:06.327 --> 00:12:08.127
Have confidence,

00:12:08.287 --> 00:12:11.447
that you can give Realization to people.

00:12:11.607 --> 00:12:16.487
For which you don’t need any help,

00:12:16.647 --> 00:12:21.727
single person can do it, thousands can do it.

00:12:21.847 --> 00:12:26.527
Is very important for the Diwali of the whole world

00:12:26.687 --> 00:12:31.927
that we should give Realization to people.

00:12:32.087 --> 00:12:35.287
Very important.

00:12:35.447 --> 00:12:41.607
Now, in Sahaj Yoga, many people are such

00:12:41.767 --> 00:12:45.367
who are little frustrated with themselves,

00:12:45.527 --> 00:12:47.447
specially with their past.

00:12:47.607 --> 00:12:49.727
Forget the past!

00:12:49.847 --> 00:12:54.607
Past is not important, what is important is present.

00:12:54.767 --> 00:13:00.167
At this present moment, what have you to do?

00:13:00.327 --> 00:13:03.447
You don’t have to worry about the past,

00:13:03.607 --> 00:13:05.567
that “I’ve done this, I’ve done that”

00:13:05.727 --> 00:13:07.567
what’s done is finished.

00:13:07.727 --> 00:13:12.007
Now you look out for the future.

00:13:12.167 --> 00:13:15.167
What can you do for the future.

00:13:15.327 --> 00:13:18.847
And some or other, with the light

00:13:19.007 --> 00:13:22.207
you see your path,

00:13:22.367 --> 00:13:25.687
you get rid of all the darkness

00:13:25.847 --> 00:13:29.407
and you know how far to go,

00:13:29.567 --> 00:13:32.087
how to reach people

00:13:32.247 --> 00:13:34.927
and how to spread Sahaj Yog.

00:13:35.087 --> 00:13:40.367
It’s something you have already within you,

00:13:40.527 --> 00:13:43.727
but you have to first of all

00:13:43.887 --> 00:13:46.767
establish your connection with it.

00:13:46.927 --> 00:13:49.127
If you have established your connection

00:13:49.287 --> 00:13:52.487
with that ocean that you have,

00:13:52.847 --> 00:13:55.767
you can definitely work it out,

00:13:55.927 --> 00:13:59.647
work it out in such a beautiful manner

00:13:59.807 --> 00:14:03.567
and you’ll be amazed how you’ll be successful.

00:14:03.847 --> 00:14:10.247
The success that you get out of all this ignorance,

00:14:10.407 --> 00:14:12.807
you are amazed at it.

00:14:12.967 --> 00:14:15.487
But you have the light.

00:14:15.647 --> 00:14:19.847
With the light you do remove all the darkness.

00:14:20.007 --> 00:14:21.607
Doesn’t have to think about it,

00:14:21.767 --> 00:14:24.687
just removes, because you have the light.

00:14:24.847 --> 00:14:28.087
But if you don’t have the light,

00:14:28.247 --> 00:14:31.967
then, no use talking about it.

00:14:32.127 --> 00:14:36.327
No use doing it, because,

00:14:36.487 --> 00:14:41.167
it doesn’t give any success.

00:14:41.327 --> 00:14:44.327
On the contrary, it’s a failure,

00:14:44.487 --> 00:14:46.687
failure of the worst type.

00:14:46.847 --> 00:14:51.047
And can be very dangerous for people.

00:14:54.327 --> 00:15:00.127
We have had very funny experiences also in the Sahaja Yoga.

00:15:00.287 --> 00:15:05.807
But, I think they all are learning one by one:

00:15:05.967 --> 00:15:08.087
that this should not have been done,

00:15:08.247 --> 00:15:10.447
that was wrong.

00:15:10.607 --> 00:15:15.807
Now, what blinds you we should find out.

00:15:15.967 --> 00:15:20.567
In this country, it’s such a money oriented country America is,

00:15:20.727 --> 00:15:23.527
which has spread all over the world.

00:15:23.687 --> 00:15:31.247
And being money oriented, you do get enamored,

00:15:31.407 --> 00:15:36.887
you do feel that you must make money out of Sahaj Yoga.

00:15:37.047 --> 00:15:40.167
There are some who do not think like that,

00:15:40.327 --> 00:15:44.607
but they are still running after making money.

00:15:44.767 --> 00:15:48.527
There is no need at all for you to make money

00:15:48.687 --> 00:15:55.487
or to find for yourself a kind of a security in money.

00:15:55.647 --> 00:16:00.447
Your security is inbuilt within you.

00:16:00.807 --> 00:16:09.367
So, all these outside things which are absolutely unnecessary

00:16:09.527 --> 00:16:13.007
should not blind you.

00:16:13.167 --> 00:16:16.887
Now, if you have the light, you can see it clearly.

00:16:17.047 --> 00:16:20.687
And this help of the Divine,

00:16:20.847 --> 00:16:24.127
you see that very clearly in your life

00:16:24.287 --> 00:16:26.367
and you are surprised

00:16:26.527 --> 00:16:30.287
how the Divine has helped you at different points.

00:16:30.447 --> 00:16:34.687
I get letters from people who say:

00:16:34.847 --> 00:16:36.927
“Mother, thank You very much,

00:16:37.087 --> 00:16:42.167
I got rid of my problem, I got rid of my enemies”,

00:16:42.327 --> 00:16:45.407
all kinds of things.

00:16:45.567 --> 00:16:47.927
While I have done nothing.

00:16:48.087 --> 00:16:53.087
It’s your light which has removed the darkness.

00:16:53.247 --> 00:16:55.567
If you are ignorant,

00:16:55.727 --> 00:16:59.047
then only the light can remove the darkness

00:16:59.207 --> 00:17:01.727
of your ignorance also.

00:17:01.847 --> 00:17:08.287
Actually, we don’t know how much

00:17:08.447 --> 00:17:12.007
there is the power of the light.

00:17:12.167 --> 00:17:14.527
As you can see here,

00:17:14.687 --> 00:17:21.527
every light is giving such a lot of,

00:17:21.687 --> 00:17:27.567
not only energy, but also complete picture.

00:17:27.847 --> 00:17:31.687
So thus you can make out,

00:17:31.847 --> 00:17:37.447
for example you can make out if somebody is a realized soul or not.

00:17:37.607 --> 00:17:39.887
Is not necessary

00:17:40.047 --> 00:17:42.887
that you have to go near that person

00:17:43.047 --> 00:17:47.727
or take any special care or anything.

00:17:47.887 --> 00:17:53.927
You will just know that this person is a realized soul or not.

00:17:54.087 --> 00:17:57.647
I’ve had many such experiences,

00:17:57.807 --> 00:18:04.607
where I found that people don’t know who is a realized soul,

00:18:04.767 --> 00:18:08.167
it’s very surprising.

00:18:08.327 --> 00:18:12.007
If you know who is a realized soul,

00:18:12.167 --> 00:18:16.247
then half of your problem is over.

00:18:16.607 --> 00:18:19.727
Now, the second one is the problem

00:18:19.887 --> 00:18:23.607
of how to convince that fellow

00:18:23.767 --> 00:18:27.407
what he is capable of doing.

00:18:27.567 --> 00:18:31.367
I find that problem also with Sahaja Yogis.

00:18:31.967 --> 00:18:38.047
They are capable of very great work

00:18:38.207 --> 00:18:40.687
all over the world,

00:18:40.847 --> 00:18:45.047
they can find out so many things,

00:18:45.207 --> 00:18:52.247
which normally, normal people cannot find out.

00:18:52.407 --> 00:18:57.247
But, Sahaja Yogis can immediately find out

00:18:57.407 --> 00:19:02.567
what sort of a person they are facing.

00:19:02.727 --> 00:19:04.247
This is the difference.

00:19:04.407 --> 00:19:06.887
That means you know the truth.

00:19:07.047 --> 00:19:09.607
Truth about everyone,

00:19:09.767 --> 00:19:13.767
truth about the whole situation.

00:19:13.927 --> 00:19:20.847
Truth about who is just boasting,

00:19:21.047 --> 00:19:24.407
or just making up a story,

00:19:24.567 --> 00:19:26.647
or some sort of a hypocrisy.

00:19:26.807 --> 00:19:31.047
It’s not difficult, because now you have the sight.

00:19:31.207 --> 00:19:34.167
You can see with your light

00:19:34.327 --> 00:19:39.207
what’s wrong or what’s good with others.

00:19:39.367 --> 00:19:42.487
Such a blessing it is for you,

00:19:42.647 --> 00:19:46.807
that you cannot be cheated.

00:19:46.967 --> 00:19:55.287
Because also, you are looked after by the Divine,

00:19:55.447 --> 00:19:58.927
guided all the time by the Divine.

00:19:59.087 --> 00:20:01.447
Have faith in the Divine,

00:20:01.607 --> 00:20:03.767
have faith in the Divine!

00:20:03.927 --> 00:20:06.447
That’s very important.

00:20:06.607 --> 00:20:09.927
As you have faith in a candle,

00:20:10.087 --> 00:20:15.607
have faith that the Divine will give you the light,

00:20:15.767 --> 00:20:18.407
will guide your path,

00:20:18.567 --> 00:20:22.207
will take you to right place

00:20:22.367 --> 00:20:24.487
to do the right things!

00:20:24.647 --> 00:20:27.807
I mean so many of these experiences are with you.

00:20:27.967 --> 00:20:32.647
I need not tell you how much people have written to Me,

00:20:32.807 --> 00:20:37.447
how they found things working out.

00:20:37.607 --> 00:20:43.207
Despite all that, we are collective,

00:20:43.367 --> 00:20:47.287
we are nice to each other,

00:20:47.447 --> 00:20:50.727
we don’t tell lies,

00:20:50.847 --> 00:20:55.527
we don’t try to destroy anyone.

00:20:55.687 --> 00:21:00.367
That means we are much above all human failings.

00:21:00.527 --> 00:21:04.167
And this is only because of the light.

00:21:04.327 --> 00:21:07.847
You can see where you are faltering.

00:21:08.007 --> 00:21:12.967
It’s just you see for yourself.

00:21:13.127 --> 00:21:15.487
For that, I think,

00:21:15.647 --> 00:21:20.407
meditation is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:21:20.567 --> 00:21:23.967
Everyday you should do meditation.

00:21:24.127 --> 00:21:27.487
Those who do not do meditation

00:21:27.647 --> 00:21:31.527
are capable of falling down.

00:21:31.687 --> 00:21:39.207
Because meditation is like putting oil into the lamp.

00:21:39.367 --> 00:21:43.767
Those who do not meditate, think they can do without it,

00:21:43.927 --> 00:21:46.287
are sadly mistaken.

00:21:46.447 --> 00:21:52.767
They have to meditate, morning and evening.

00:21:52.967 --> 00:21:57.687
The problem is everything comes so handy,

00:21:57.847 --> 00:22:00.007
so simple,

00:22:00.167 --> 00:22:04.807
that they don’t understand that meditation is very important.

00:22:04.967 --> 00:22:07.447
Maybe .

00:22:07.607 --> 00:22:12.047
Not you, but there are many I know, who get Realization,

00:22:12.207 --> 00:22:15.367
who don’t meditate.

00:22:15.527 --> 00:22:22.087
And their style is different,

00:22:22.247 --> 00:22:25.167
their nature is different.

00:22:25.327 --> 00:22:27.847
Meditation is such a soothing thing,

00:22:28.007 --> 00:22:36.207
such a beautiful way of connection with the Divine,

00:22:36.367 --> 00:22:40.327
that all your problems get solved

00:22:40.487 --> 00:22:43.607
in that meditative mood.

00:22:43.767 --> 00:22:47.407
If you are not meditating,

00:22:47.567 --> 00:22:51.607
you are not following meditation,

00:22:51.767 --> 00:22:54.767
then maybe your light will go down,

00:22:54.927 --> 00:22:58.447
it won’t give sufficient light.

00:23:02.207 --> 00:23:05.407
Is important, very important,

00:23:06.247 --> 00:23:11.447
to find out about yourself, about others

00:23:11.607 --> 00:23:14.607
in the meditation.

00:23:14.767 --> 00:23:18.967
“How to do meditation?”, many people ask Me.

00:23:19.127 --> 00:23:21.447
Don’t do anything

00:23:21.607 --> 00:23:25.287
to just go into thoughtless awareness.

00:23:25.447 --> 00:23:28.207
Try to go to the thoughtless awareness.

00:23:28.367 --> 00:23:34.247
If you can get into that condition of thoughtless awareness,

00:23:34.407 --> 00:23:36.687
you’ve done your job.

00:23:36.847 --> 00:23:39.287
Because that’s the point where

00:23:39.447 --> 00:23:43.967
you are with the truth, with the reality,

00:23:44.127 --> 00:23:45.527
with the joy,

00:23:45.687 --> 00:23:49.887
with everything that is so fundamental.

00:23:50.047 --> 00:23:54.087
When you meditate, try not to,

00:23:54.247 --> 00:24:01.007
not to make some sort of a function out of it, no.

00:24:01.167 --> 00:24:05.407
Meditation is something silencing your Self,

00:24:05.567 --> 00:24:10.607
silencing your thoughts and the going

00:24:10.767 --> 00:24:15.007
to that deep ocean which is within you itself.

00:24:15.167 --> 00:24:19.167
But supposing you don’t do that.

00:24:19.327 --> 00:24:21.287
If you don’t meditate,

00:24:21.447 --> 00:24:23.967
I can make out immediately

00:24:24.127 --> 00:24:27.047
those who are meditating and those who are not

00:24:27.207 --> 00:24:29.767
It’s not difficult for Me.

00:24:29.927 --> 00:24:34.567
Those who do not meditate are always hesitating,

00:24:35.487 --> 00:24:40.767
they are confused, they can’t understand.

00:24:40.927 --> 00:24:44.847
And that’s why meditation

00:24:45.007 --> 00:24:49.247
is the most important thing in Sahaj Yoga.

00:24:49.407 --> 00:24:53.127
Just like a light burns,

00:24:53.287 --> 00:24:56.447
in the electricity flowing in it, you can say,

00:24:56.607 --> 00:25:00.487
or by, because of the candles,

00:25:00.647 --> 00:25:04.047
in the same way meditation

00:25:04.207 --> 00:25:13.127
is a ‘continuous’ availability of the Divine Force.

00:25:13.327 --> 00:25:17.447
That will reduce all your apprehensions.

00:25:17.607 --> 00:25:19.487
Not only that,

00:25:19.647 --> 00:25:24.007
but takes out all the negative thoughts,

00:25:24.167 --> 00:25:30.247
it takes out all the discouraging things.

00:25:30.407 --> 00:25:34.447
And when you are meditating like that,

00:25:34.607 --> 00:25:37.487
thoughtless awareness,

00:25:37.647 --> 00:25:42.087
then you’ll be amazed how you are helped

00:25:42.247 --> 00:25:46.407
from within and without.

00:25:46.567 --> 00:25:49.527
It’s a terrible power that works,

00:25:49.687 --> 00:25:52.207
this thoughtless awareness.

00:25:52.367 --> 00:25:56.687
So those who do not meditate

00:25:56.847 --> 00:25:59.447
cannot go very much far

00:25:59.607 --> 00:26:03.127
with the advantage of Sahaja Yoga.

00:26:03.287 --> 00:26:06.447
One should try to meditate

00:26:06.607 --> 00:26:11.167
and go up to the point of thoughtless awareness.

00:26:11.887 --> 00:26:15.167
So, what happens to you?

00:26:15.327 --> 00:26:18.527
If you are in thoughtless awareness,

00:26:18.687 --> 00:26:21.207
what happens to you?

00:26:21.367 --> 00:26:29.207
Is that you get the confidence,

00:26:29.367 --> 00:26:34.567
complete confidence of Divinity,

00:26:35.727 --> 00:26:40.007
you know you have that.

00:26:40.167 --> 00:26:44.327
I’ve seen children coming from our school in Dharamsala:

00:26:44.487 --> 00:26:50.527
extremely confident and extremely humble.

00:26:50.687 --> 00:26:53.207
And I asked them: “What do you do?”

00:26:53.367 --> 00:26:57.807
They said: “Mother, we meditate.

00:26:57.967 --> 00:27:05.607
We meditate in the school in the evening

00:27:05.767 --> 00:27:08.687
and that meditation helps.”

00:27:08.847 --> 00:27:12.127
Imagine these small children can say that,

00:27:12.287 --> 00:27:15.727
so why not you also understand

00:27:15.887 --> 00:27:19.607
that meditation will give you security,

00:27:19.767 --> 00:27:23.727
it will give you real enlightenment

00:27:23.927 --> 00:27:28.687
and a complete connection with the Divine.

00:27:28.847 --> 00:27:33.207
Without the connection of the Divine,

00:27:33.367 --> 00:27:36.967
what’s the use of doing Sahaj Yoga?

00:27:45.807 --> 00:27:52.767
I know the people who are meditating,

00:27:53.367 --> 00:27:56.727
who have gone down into their being

00:27:56.847 --> 00:27:59.967
and who are very developed.

00:28:00.127 --> 00:28:04.287
Also I know people who are little superficial.

00:28:04.487 --> 00:28:08.247
Your depth is in thoughtless awareness.

00:28:08.407 --> 00:28:13.367
Is a very important point which you should reach.

00:28:13.527 --> 00:28:19.287
Looking at anything, if you are thoughtlessly aware,

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:23.407
then you really become reflective about it,

00:28:23.567 --> 00:28:28.607
just works out that way.

00:28:28.767 --> 00:28:34.047
I don’t know how far you can remain in that condition.

00:28:34.207 --> 00:28:38.327
But even for a second you can achieve it,

00:28:38.487 --> 00:28:41.967
you’ll start achieving it more and more.

00:28:42.127 --> 00:28:45.327
I’ve talked so much about meditation before,

00:28:45.487 --> 00:28:50.927
but today when I see all these candles burning,

00:28:51.087 --> 00:28:54.407
I think they are all meditative,

00:28:54.567 --> 00:28:57.247
they are all in meditation

00:28:57.407 --> 00:29:00.607
and that’s how they are burning.

00:29:00.767 --> 00:29:06.367
In the same way, Sahaja Yogis who meditate, I know,

00:29:06.527 --> 00:29:08.887
and those who don’t, I know.

00:29:09.047 --> 00:29:10.887
And if they have problems,

00:29:11.047 --> 00:29:14.167
I know why the problems are there.

00:29:14.327 --> 00:29:17.447
Main thing is: your connection with the Divine

00:29:17.607 --> 00:29:21.567
is only possible when you meditate

00:29:21.727 --> 00:29:25.087
and become thoughtlessly aware.

00:29:25.247 --> 00:29:31.367
That’s the point where Divine works.

00:29:31.527 --> 00:29:33.647
It helps you.

00:29:33.807 --> 00:29:39.087
It comes to your help in such a way

00:29:39.247 --> 00:29:44.247
that you don’t know how you have achieved it.

00:29:44.407 --> 00:29:48.687
So thoughtless awareness is the first point

00:29:48.847 --> 00:29:51.647
all of you should achieve.

00:29:51.807 --> 00:29:54.007
Very important.

00:29:54.167 --> 00:29:59.127
After that you can achieve something else,

00:29:59.287 --> 00:30:03.207
but the first step is thoughtless awareness.

00:30:03.367 --> 00:30:10.207
Is very important to become thoughtlessly aware,

00:30:10.367 --> 00:30:13.847
because then there are no thoughts coming

00:30:14.007 --> 00:30:19.327
from the left or right, from the present or the future.

00:30:19.487 --> 00:30:24.327
Just in the present you are there.

00:30:24.487 --> 00:30:28.847
Is something you all have, is not that

00:30:29.007 --> 00:30:31.167
Me, I’m saying that to you,

00:30:31.327 --> 00:30:33.407
but all of you have this.

00:30:33.567 --> 00:30:35.367
But ‘steady yourself’!

00:30:35.527 --> 00:30:40.047
You have to steady yourself at thoughtless awareness.

00:30:40.207 --> 00:30:42.687
How long, that’s not the point.

00:30:42.847 --> 00:30:45.407
The point is once you touched it,

00:30:45.567 --> 00:30:47.927
you’ll go on touching it.

00:30:48.087 --> 00:30:54.887
Many people meditate, but their thought process is going on,

00:30:55.047 --> 00:31:00.447
they are not thoughtlessly silent.

00:31:00.607 --> 00:31:05.367
Now this is the one point which is very important.

00:31:05.527 --> 00:31:08.007
If you have to grow,

00:31:08.167 --> 00:31:11.647
you should be absolutely in connection with the Divine

00:31:11.807 --> 00:31:14.167
through thoughtless awareness.

00:31:14.327 --> 00:31:16.167
You don’t have to pray,

00:31:16.327 --> 00:31:18.767
you don’t have to call anyone, nothing,

00:31:18.927 --> 00:31:21.807
it just works because it is within you.

00:31:21.967 --> 00:31:24.127
All these thoughts are bombarding

00:31:24.287 --> 00:31:27.207
from both the sides in your mind.

00:31:27.367 --> 00:31:30.007
These thoughts that are coming to you

00:31:30.167 --> 00:31:32.847
have no meaning with you,

00:31:33.007 --> 00:31:35.927
they do not substantiate.

00:31:36.087 --> 00:31:39.247
Yourself you are an ocean

00:31:39.407 --> 00:31:45.847
and you have to get into that state of thoughtless awareness.

00:31:46.007 --> 00:31:50.967
It is always described in all the great books,

00:31:51.127 --> 00:31:54.687
but not so clearly as I am telling you.

00:31:54.847 --> 00:31:59.207
I don’t say that some of you do not get thoughtless awareness,

00:31:59.367 --> 00:32:01.487
so they are good for nothing, no.

00:32:01.647 --> 00:32:06.967
But, please try, you can all get into that state

00:32:07.127 --> 00:32:09.007
of thoughtless awareness.

00:32:09.167 --> 00:32:12.327
Even for a second if you get it,

00:32:12.487 --> 00:32:14.367
it’s a very good idea.

00:32:14.527 --> 00:32:20.207
Then you go on increasing that second.

00:32:21.487 --> 00:32:27.887
I think is a reflecting mind.

00:32:28.047 --> 00:32:31.447
When you look at something,

00:32:32.967 --> 00:32:36.807
you will become thoughtlessly aware.

00:32:37.447 --> 00:32:42.567
And then this mind reflects

00:32:43.007 --> 00:32:48.447
to the depth of what you see.

00:32:48.607 --> 00:32:51.607
That’s how you all will become really

00:32:51.767 --> 00:32:54.847
very creative Sahaja Yogis.

00:32:55.007 --> 00:33:03.687
What I find, that this state of thoughtless awareness

00:33:03.847 --> 00:33:08.007
is not established by many, which is not good.

00:33:08.167 --> 00:33:11.887
Today on this day of Diwali, I would say that:

00:33:12.047 --> 00:33:17.407
“You enlighten your Self with thoughtless awareness!”

00:33:17.567 --> 00:33:20.927
It is not difficult, is within you.

00:33:21.087 --> 00:33:24.967
Because thoughts are coming from this side and that side.

00:33:25.127 --> 00:33:29.647
And they are not the waves of your brain, no,

00:33:29.807 --> 00:33:32.407
just your own reactions.

00:33:32.567 --> 00:33:39.567
But, in case you meditate in the real sense of the word,

00:33:39.727 --> 00:33:43.247
then you will get into that thoughtless awareness.

00:33:43.407 --> 00:33:46.767
Which is a very important point

00:33:46.927 --> 00:33:50.247
and all these nonsensical thoughts,

00:33:50.407 --> 00:33:55.647
which are of no use to you, will disappear.

00:33:55.807 --> 00:34:01.367
They won’t be there and then your growth is possible

00:34:01.527 --> 00:34:04.807
and you’ll grow very well.

00:34:04.967 --> 00:34:08.127
Many people are here, who will say:

00:34:08.287 --> 00:34:10.527
“Mother, we don’t get that state.”

00:34:10.687 --> 00:34:12.847
Try,

00:34:13.007 --> 00:34:14.847
try that!

00:34:15.047 --> 00:34:18.247
I don’t believe you cannot get it.

00:34:18.407 --> 00:34:22.087
All of you can get that thought

00:34:22.247 --> 00:34:25.607
that “I can get it”, and you will get it.

00:34:25.767 --> 00:34:33.527
In that you don’t have to discard anything,

00:34:33.687 --> 00:34:40.567
you don’t have to see anything, just go into meditation

00:34:40.727 --> 00:34:44.687
and you’ll be amazed how it will work.

00:34:44.847 --> 00:34:48.447
Of course you are very much there, most of you,

00:34:48.607 --> 00:34:51.087
but still, I would say,

00:34:51.247 --> 00:34:58.207
increase that thoughtless awareness, that area!

00:34:58.367 --> 00:35:04.447
Today is very important because of this day of Diwali.

00:35:04.607 --> 00:35:10.127
Diwali is supposed to be enlightenment day.

00:35:10.287 --> 00:35:15.247
But enlightenment within is:

00:35:15.407 --> 00:35:19.807
how much you are in thoughtless awareness?

00:35:19.967 --> 00:35:22.327
And the everything works out,

00:35:22.487 --> 00:35:26.367
because you are the ocean of it,

00:35:26.527 --> 00:35:28.927
you have it within yourself.

00:35:29.087 --> 00:35:31.687
Only you have to tap it.

00:35:31.847 --> 00:35:34.447
If you don’t tap it,

00:35:34.607 --> 00:35:37.567
then it doesn’t work out.

00:35:37.727 --> 00:35:40.167
You have to just tap it

00:35:40.327 --> 00:35:45.847
and you’ll be amazed that you are a source of such joy,

00:35:46.047 --> 00:35:51.407
source of such happiness,

00:35:51.567 --> 00:35:56.167
I should say, source of real enlightenment.

00:35:56.327 --> 00:35:59.847
So, today’s message is that:

00:36:00.047 --> 00:36:05.607
“While meditating, go into thoughtless awareness.”

00:36:05.767 --> 00:36:09.207
No thought is important,

00:36:09.367 --> 00:36:12.527
because it’s your own creation.

00:36:12.687 --> 00:36:17.047
But if you have to become with the Divine Creation,

00:36:17.207 --> 00:36:21.447
you have to get to that state of thoughtless awareness,

00:36:21.607 --> 00:36:24.127
minimum of minimum.

00:36:24.287 --> 00:36:27.807
Once that comes to you, gradually it will grow

00:36:27.967 --> 00:36:30.807
and you’ll be amazed how

00:36:30.967 --> 00:36:36.007
you will be able to grow into Sahaja Yoga in a very big way.

00:36:36.207 --> 00:36:38.807
Thank you very much!
