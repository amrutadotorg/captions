18:47.909 --> 18:55.995
It's another great pleasure to come to America
to meet you all people here.

19:04.609 --> 19:11.013
This one, as I have told you, is a very important country

19:13.001 --> 19:16.223
in the field of spirituality.

19:17.096 --> 19:21.084
Not because it's a large country

19:21.330 --> 19:27.921
or because it is very prosperous,

19:28.654 --> 19:40.017
but because, as you know, it is the Vishuddhi in the plan of Virata.

19:40.785 --> 19:46.690
Vishuddhi is such an important chakra;

19:48.102 --> 19:52.329
it has a very great manifestation also.

19:53.787 --> 20:02.623
For example it has another, you can say a subsidiary chakra,

20:04.068 --> 20:06.809
which we call as Hamsa Chakra.

20:10.301 --> 20:24.205
And the star which is increasing this center,

20:24.395 --> 20:31.535
we say the star that resides on
which this center is working, is Saturn.

20:32.858 --> 20:38.087
And as you know with Saturn there is
another small little Saturn moving.

20:38.587 --> 20:42.960
In the same way with this Vishuddhi Chakra,

20:43.170 --> 20:50.030
there's another one which is a very important chakra,

20:50.924 --> 20:54.074
which we call as Hamsa Chakra.

20:54.820 --> 20:59.796
We've had a puja of Hamsa Chakra in Germany once.

21:00.352 --> 21:07.065
And it has acted, I think, because Germans have realized

21:07.215 --> 21:16.796
that whatever they have done so far was absolutely inhuman.

21:17.868 --> 21:21.513
And I was so happy to see that when I went to Russia,

21:22.242 --> 21:28.962
the people who came to give them realization were mostly Germans.

21:32.055 --> 21:39.337
It really makes you feel so tender about the whole thing

21:39.620 --> 21:45.928
that the Germans felt it is important, I mean,
they were the ones who were attracted

21:46.428 --> 21:51.088
to come to Russia to give realization to Russians;

21:51.136 --> 21:57.610
and you must know that the number of Russians killed

21:57.661 --> 22:02.966
are the maximum in the war, in this war, by Germans.

22:05.766 --> 22:10.879
So the discretion, the Divine Discretion,

22:11.300 --> 22:19.994
that manifests through your Hamsa Chakra first started in Germany.

22:21.272 --> 22:30.629
And now you see how East Germany is entering into German territory,

22:31.143 --> 22:38.143
West Germany, and how they're welcoming them, looking after them.

22:40.373 --> 22:48.398
And who did was, all these things was,
few Sahaja Yogis who triggered it.

22:51.073 --> 22:56.388
So in those countries where there has been tremendous war

22:56.413 --> 23:00.046
problem, and they had czars and they had to go through hell -

23:00.071 --> 23:07.071
even Germans had to suffer a lot because of Hitler's misguidance.

23:07.841 --> 23:14.793
They have known hardships, they have known sacrifices,
they have known all kinds of ordeals they had to go through,

23:15.723 --> 23:22.723
but somehow this country has been blessed to such an extent

23:23.036 --> 23:31.500
that Americans never realized what is it that is hardship.

23:33.183 --> 23:38.941
And the blessings really have spoiled them.

23:40.159 --> 23:45.801
Hardships have been in all these countries
which we call as Eastern Bloc,

23:46.446 --> 23:51.848
and Sahaja Yoga is spreading like wildfire in all
these Eastern Bloc countries

23:52.126 --> 23:57.407
where they have been completely
under the rule of Russians, we can say,

23:57.813 --> 24:01.197
or under the rule of terror.

24:02.000 --> 24:08.377
And the same terror has acted in Russia, throughout.

24:11.649 --> 24:18.196
In that terror, in that fear, it is surprising

24:18.824 --> 24:26.568
how this wisdom has grown in all
these people much more than in countries

24:26.676 --> 24:35.639
where we have the greatest affluence,  the greatest comfort of life.

24:40.043 --> 24:46.638
The hardship has taught them,
the fear has taught them, to be wise.

24:47.027 --> 24:51.190
And the best part is the discretion.

24:52.387 --> 25:00.119
Now this being Shri Krishna's country,
because He is Kubera, He's the God of wealth.

25:01.176 --> 25:04.359
The country is wealthy, no doubt;

25:05.423 --> 25:16.620
but the other part of Shri Krishna is completely missing,
is the Divine Discretion.

25:16.993 --> 25:24.651
How His Divine Discretion is shown,
even in Mahabharata, is wonderful to see.

25:26.698 --> 25:32.211
How He managed the Pandavas to win the war

25:32.299 --> 25:35.973
through His Divine Discretion because they were dharmic,

25:36.323 --> 25:39.281
they were standing in dharma.

25:39.397 --> 25:45.468
And how He supported the Pandavas because they were dharmic.

25:46.372 --> 25:49.880
But just the opposite is the situation of this America,

25:50.023 --> 25:53.891
that America always supports wrong people.

25:55.304 --> 26:03.100
And it has no principle of righteousness
or principle of its own freedom.

26:04.815 --> 26:12.315
For example, to support something like Argentina or Peru,

26:12.649 --> 26:15.690
where there's complete dictatorship.

26:15.937 --> 26:22.937
I've been there; I know what it is like in the time
it was under the regime of these people.

26:23.649 --> 26:30.389
And that's what has happened to the people of this country -
they have no Divine Discretion at all.

26:30.944 --> 26:35.558
And that's why I think all the false gurus have come and settled here,

26:35.583 --> 26:40.673
because they know these people have no Divine Discretion.

26:44.756 --> 26:48.865
The Hamsa Chakra is so weak here,

26:54.608 --> 26:59.742
that they cannot see what is dharma and what is adharma.

27:02.979 --> 27:08.300
Also, the basic principle by which this country

27:09.044 --> 27:15.230
became democratic was that this government is

27:15.643 --> 27:20.221
for the people, of the people, by the people.

27:23.581 --> 27:27.311
So it has to be people-oriented.

27:27.869 --> 27:32.495
But democracy at this stage without realization cannot work out.

27:32.742 --> 27:34.614
It's obvious.

27:36.022 --> 27:43.326
Few people who were cunning,
who could make money became money-oriented.

27:43.528 --> 27:51.120
They could advertise better;
they could manipulate better  than other people

27:51.445 --> 28:00.864
who were crooks also, making money like that,
through drugs, through other things, by other means.

28:02.219 --> 28:09.065
They could come up, they were elected, and they are in charge.

28:09.090 --> 28:14.458
So it is not people-oriented,
but it is only money-oriented democracy.

28:15.051 --> 28:18.622
And maybe if it goes on like this, you'll find

28:19.154 --> 28:24.977
you might get some horrible crooks as rulers in this country.

28:26.822 --> 28:29.502
Because the one who can make money,

28:29.852 --> 28:36.163
the one who has lots of money,
by hook or crook, whosoever may be,

28:38.421 --> 28:43.870
can win over elections and can become our ruler here.

28:48.204 --> 28:55.204
So the democracy that was started or was spelled out by Abraham Lincoln

28:56.793 --> 29:00.749
is no more there; it's a money-oriented thing.

29:01.552 --> 29:06.154
And it has generated such a bad atmosphere all over the world

29:06.594 --> 29:13.594
that in the whole world now the conservatives,
the people who think they are conservatives,

29:14.118 --> 29:18.259
who are money-oriented people, who don't care for people at all,

29:19.974 --> 29:24.137
how are becoming the leaders, everywhere.

29:28.569 --> 29:42.181
So to be people-oriented one had to, first of all, understand

29:43.253 --> 29:47.660
that you have to have your realization,

29:48.600 --> 29:52.159
otherwise you do not become a collective being.

29:52.870 --> 29:55.594
If you do not become the collective being,

29:55.638 --> 30:05.140
you cannot enjoy the beautiful virtue of generosity.

30:06.827 --> 30:10.224
And when you do not have that generosity,

30:12.305 --> 30:20.242
then you become a person of a very small mind and a small heart.

30:23.017 --> 30:28.484
And the crookedness works everywhere.

30:28.690 --> 30:32.205
Outside they're very sweet to talk.

30:32.301 --> 30:37.245
But inside don't know what they will do,  how they'll deceive.

30:38.901 --> 30:41.960
In this kind of atmosphere we are.

30:42.490 --> 30:45.654
While you know in Russia we have done so well.

30:46.194 --> 30:51.014
In Russia people were just waiting for a Mother to come, that's all.

30:51.895 --> 30:54.538
They're Mother worshipers to begin with,

30:54.937 --> 30:58.223
and they were wanting somebody just to love them,

30:58.588 --> 31:03.886
every one of them, to tell them about love.

31:05.414 --> 31:08.924
Because they felt they were never loved by their mother.

31:08.955 --> 31:12.049
Here also, nobody's loved.

31:13.843 --> 31:18.185
But the pattern of the government there

31:18.210 --> 31:23.264
and the pattern of the people are two different types.

31:23.431 --> 31:28.824
The government people are very, you can call them very dominating,

31:28.959 --> 31:33.194
extremely strict and exploiting type.

31:33.393 --> 31:36.817
But the people are the exploited ones.

31:37.087 --> 31:42.520
But here, the pattern of the government is taken over by people.

31:45.728 --> 31:50.460
As the government is exploiting people,
people are also exploiting each other.

31:50.635 --> 31:54.956
As much as they can exploit, very good.
After all money is the end of it.

31:57.528 --> 32:03.760
That's why I used to think why in America Sahaja Yoga is failing.

32:04.262 --> 32:06.282
All kinds of thugs have come here.

32:06.307 --> 32:10.521
They have made lots of money, they have ...
I mean they all are thrown out and

32:10.546 --> 32:13.032
so many had to be thrown out, it's all right.

32:13.120 --> 32:17.778
But as far as Sahaja Yoga message is concerned, people cannot absorb it.

32:21.223 --> 32:24.697
So now for Sahaja Yogis it is very important

32:25.530 --> 32:30.350
to become really very deep Sahaja Yogis -

32:30.716 --> 32:36.926
very, very deep - so that we can trigger better.

32:38.494 --> 32:44.739
Even if there are two Sahaja Yogis
who are very deep, one can trigger a lot.

32:47.217 --> 32:50.547
Like you'll be surprised in Hungary
people were saying in the beginning,

32:50.572 --> 32:52.556
"Mother, what about Hungary? It should become free."

32:52.581 --> 32:55.925
I said, "Let there be one Sahaja Yogi to come in."

32:56.330 --> 33:04.274
Only one fellow came in - absolutely sick,
very thin and worn-out fellow.

33:04.673 --> 33:08.017
I treated him. I cured him.

33:08.383 --> 33:11.699
And with love, he got nourishment.

33:13.247 --> 33:16.818
And within eight days after his realization,

33:17.362 --> 33:25.669
he went back, and after a week, Hungary got its freedom.

33:26.735 --> 33:30.368
Though we are few in here,

33:30.519 --> 33:34.721
we all have to be very conscious of it -

33:34.889 --> 33:42.145
that we are the foundation, and if we fail, we'll fail our country.

33:43.224 --> 33:51.617
And we have to be very deep, sensible Sahaja Yogis.

33:52.839 --> 33:55.657
So what problems do we face here?

33:56.316 --> 34:04.287
First as I've told hundred times that you have to open your heart.

34:06.517 --> 34:12.887
That's such an important thing for all Sahaja Yogis to open their heart.

34:13.720 --> 34:19.322
Look into your hearts. What do you want?

34:22.761 --> 34:29.784
Not through rationality, but through vibrations.

34:30.236 --> 34:32.616
What do you want?

34:32.935 --> 34:35.960
You ask yourself, "What do I want?"

34:36.328 --> 34:39.249
Then say few words, "I want money."

34:39.413 --> 34:41.400
Vibrations won't flow.

34:41.971 --> 34:46.130
"I want this, that." Vibrations won't flow.

34:46.809 --> 34:48.681
Then what do you want?

34:49.436 --> 34:53.435
" I want to be a deep Sahaja Yogi, very deep.

34:53.658 --> 34:57.122
So I could save my country."

34:58.050 --> 35:00.879
If Americans will go to hell,

35:00.995 --> 35:05.332
you will be held responsible for that, nobody else.

35:07.317 --> 35:11.782
You need very few people to trigger it, I tell you.

35:13.025 --> 35:17.203
But we still stick on to our past.

35:18.456 --> 35:23.915
Problems and problems of America are
very different type all the time.

35:24.425 --> 35:26.625
First is aggressiveness.

35:29.885 --> 35:33.222
What is in aggressiveness?

35:34.747 --> 35:40.437
Loving someone, being kind to someone,

35:41.506 --> 35:47.407
should be so natural because that is what your Spirit is.

35:47.621 --> 35:53.560
It loves. It enjoys the love, giving love.

35:56.670 --> 36:05.904
So to allow your Spirit to manifest,
you have to understand Its nature.

36:06.675 --> 36:14.859
Spirit can never be aggressive, can never dominate.

36:15.060 --> 36:22.569
It respects the freedom of another person
because It's a free being.

36:25.376 --> 36:29.859
So this aggressiveness that we have within us,

36:29.947 --> 36:32.506
we have to really challenge it

36:32.664 --> 36:36.156
and ask, "Why are we aggressive?"

36:39.242 --> 36:47.385
But the understanding about oneself has to be very honest also.

36:47.536 --> 36:59.380
Because if you want to justify,
and if you want to close your eyes to reality,

37:00.506 --> 37:04.987
then you cannot improve yourself.

37:05.489 --> 37:12.489
And when the depth grows inside then it is tremendous, I tell you,

37:13.134 --> 37:15.750
because this Power which is surrounding us -

37:15.775 --> 37:18.774
which you know about, which you have felt it -

37:19.155 --> 37:26.054
has to flow through a medium which is absolutely clean,

37:27.002 --> 37:30.277
egoless, conditionless.

37:30.438 --> 37:33.509
But we are so much conditioned,

37:33.979 --> 37:36.969
and in this so-called free country,

37:37.239 --> 37:40.785
this freedom has conditioned us.
It's like a person who is let loose,

37:40.810 --> 37:42.624
doesn't know where to go.

37:42.666 --> 37:47.467
He bangs his head this side, bangs his head that side,

37:48.314 --> 37:52.110
And the problems are so funny -

37:53.414 --> 38:01.772
problems which do not exist anywhere (else), exist in this country.

38:02.695 --> 38:05.258
You know them very well.

38:05.306 --> 38:15.863
It's such shocking state that when we think about it,

38:15.919 --> 38:19.657
what's going to happen? Where are we going to be?

38:20.281 --> 38:25.505
So we are really on a warpath in America,
I must tell you, for Sahaja Yogis,

38:26.061 --> 38:33.061
really on a warpath. Unless and until you take up Sahaja Yoga as

38:33.908 --> 38:39.954
your only concern, it's not going to work out.

38:41.152 --> 38:47.106
We have problems like somebody has no job,
then somebody has this [here], he's lost something here,

38:47.184 --> 38:50.737
then husband's, wife's problems
and all these nonsensical things.

38:53.749 --> 38:56.061
Still people are struggling with that.

38:56.284 --> 39:00.818
How many times you've been married in previous lives?

39:01.118 --> 39:04.666
Then somebody's wife is dominating, somebody's husband is dominating.

39:04.691 --> 39:10.349
Such absurd things! Doesn't behoove saints.

39:11.691 --> 39:26.353
So the quality of Sahaja Yogis in America,
unless and until is raised, one cannot trigger anything here.

39:27.591 --> 39:34.513
And the first thing that the Sahaja Yogis
must have is collectivity in America,

39:34.608 --> 39:39.359
because America stands for Vishuddhi Chakra,

39:39.455 --> 39:44.983
which is manifesting collectivity within us.

39:45.372 --> 39:48.323
And if people cannot be collective,

39:49.855 --> 39:56.819
then how can you have Sahaja Yoga manifesting here? Impossible.

39:57.414 --> 40:01.410
Because that is the greatest quality you have.

40:02.010 --> 40:06.840
That's the basic power you have in this country
is the collectivity within you.

40:07.063 --> 40:10.632
So you have two basic powers. First is collectivity

40:10.831 --> 40:15.481
and the second one that you have is the Divine Discretion.

40:15.751 --> 40:20.156
Basically given to you these powers,

40:20.300 --> 40:22.942
and just the opposite if we go.

40:23.336 --> 40:27.038
I've heard about many Sahaja Yogis

40:27.063 --> 40:33.845
who avoid company of children, who run away from other people.

40:33.972 --> 40:37.065
If they see three, four people sitting there,

40:37.201 --> 40:40.938
then they can't share the room with them.

40:42.359 --> 40:43.970
It's very common.

40:48.864 --> 40:51.946
Say now, supposing there's a very small little room,

40:53.708 --> 40:56.674
and so many have to sleep in a small little room,

40:57.370 --> 41:01.683
it's nice in a way. It's an experience.

41:02.041 --> 41:05.693
Then, where do you sleep?
You sleep there, you sleep there?

41:05.718 --> 41:09.645
How do you manage?
You can't go to the bathroom. And it's an event.

41:18.905 --> 41:23.059
The life which is smooth is boring.

41:30.152 --> 41:34.402
There should be some events in life, you see, like this.

41:34.911 --> 41:37.172
But Americans always avoid

41:37.197 --> 41:45.501
any, any such thing which requires an eventful time.

41:47.607 --> 41:51.048
Otherwise, if you walk straight forward,

41:51.081 --> 41:55.454
you see, reach some place,
open the door and everything is ready made.

41:55.479 --> 41:58.706
You walk into a room, everything electrified

41:58.785 --> 42:01.058
and you just get your seat. You sit on the seat.

42:01.083 --> 42:03.740
If you have to get up, the seat puts you out.

42:06.092 --> 42:09.540
Or, I went to somebody's house and they said, "We have a bed here."

42:09.540 --> 42:10.990
I said, "What's so special?"

42:10.990 --> 42:13.928
He said, "If you press this button, your legs will come up.

42:13.937 --> 42:17.618
If you press this button,
you head will come up.

42:18.027 --> 42:19.585
You'll turn round."

42:19.610 --> 42:23.040
I said, "I can do all that Myself.

42:29.373 --> 42:34.245
I'm not that old or that weak that I can't do it."

42:35.865 --> 42:42.553
But, you see they,  the way people are, always looking for comfort,

42:42.918 --> 42:48.138
always looking for comfort, and like to have smooth life.

42:48.717 --> 42:52.270
And the smoothness has made them so boring.

42:52.301 --> 42:54.358
I mean their life is really boring.

42:54.383 --> 43:01.508
And a person who has a boring life cannot have a vision.

43:03.091 --> 43:05.137
Cannot. Everything is done up now.

43:05.162 --> 43:09.089
You go there, everything is first class.
There's nothing to worry.

43:09.116 --> 43:13.880
There's a ... you go to a hotel,
everything is paid for, nicely kept.

43:13.912 --> 43:16.444
It's a very good hotel.

43:17.200 --> 43:21.173
But only when in a hotel you are staying and suddenly you,

43:21.261 --> 43:24.121
people tell you, "Oh there's going to be an earthquake!"

43:24.146 --> 43:29.674
You run out with your pajamas
and you find yourself in funny companies.

43:29.770 --> 43:32.395
And that's what you remember.

43:34.340 --> 43:36.302
You may go to various places

43:36.318 --> 43:39.285
and live in various comforts and things.

43:39.310 --> 43:41.173
You don't remember that.

43:43.419 --> 43:47.790
So people now want to do something funny.

43:47.814 --> 43:51.473
Like they'll do trekking up, they're doing this, and

43:51.498 --> 43:54.170
all those funny sort of thing.

43:55.885 --> 43:58.807
Because the life is not eventful,

43:59.390 --> 44:04.963
they are trying something that is dangerous, that is destroying.

44:05.860 --> 44:10.653
But supposing if you had accepted events in life as important.

44:11.804 --> 44:15.027
What does it matter? Let's see what happens.

44:16.431 --> 44:21.325
For example, if I say, "Now, some people have to go from here

44:22.024 --> 44:23.920
to Phoenix and settle down there."

44:24.073 --> 44:26.410
Immediately, "How will they go?"

44:26.498 --> 44:30.724
And, "Where will be the house? Where will they stay?

44:30.749 --> 44:36.620
Who will pay for it?" And every question,
such a big question they have.

44:38.142 --> 44:40.004
"Yes, we'll go. What's the harm?

44:40.044 --> 44:43.539
We'll stay anywhere, under a tree. Doesn't matter. What's that?"

44:43.579 --> 44:48.735
After all monkeys can live there, why can't we?
They were our forefathers.

44:50.786 --> 44:57.786
But that sort of a comfort loving temperament is very dangerous.

44:58.133 --> 45:01.226
And they feel they are very tired, all the time.

45:01.226 --> 45:05.420
You see in American films nowadays what I see is anybody,

45:05.555 --> 45:09.629
even a heroine or a hero, comes and says, "Ahhh."

45:10.653 --> 45:13.928
Perhaps they think too much they are working hard

45:14.103 --> 45:16.959
or they are doing this.  All the time they think.

45:18.761 --> 45:20.876
There's a Sahaja Yogini in London.

45:20.901 --> 45:25.795
She's an Indian girl, works very hard,
does every stitching, everything she does.

45:25.874 --> 45:27.185
She's very happy.

45:27.265 --> 45:31.891
There's another one who is an English one,
he's always tired.

45:32.772 --> 45:36.581
So I told her, "Why is he tired?
He looks so healthy. Why is he so tired?"

45:36.645 --> 45:39.536
She said, "Mother, You know he thinks he's working.

45:39.553 --> 45:43.575
I don't think, I think it's Mother Who is working

45:43.600 --> 45:46.589
because I leave everything at Your Lotus Feet.

45:47.290 --> 45:50.948
I am not working. She's working.

45:51.123 --> 45:53.381
I'm leaving at Her Lotus Feet, that's all."

45:53.413 --> 45:55.683
And then you don't feel that.

45:55.778 --> 45:59.579
Now the quarrel between husband and wife here is mainly,

45:59.685 --> 46:03.323
"how many dishes you have washed,
how many dishes I have washed."

46:05.587 --> 46:10.201
"How much physical work you have done,
how much physical work I have done."

46:10.645 --> 46:17.413
It's a kind of a competition going on as to all the time weigh

46:17.636 --> 46:19.800
"what you have done, what I have done."

46:19.911 --> 46:25.831
But supposing if you want to do something in such a manner that,

46:25.856 --> 46:30.755
"Let me see, I will surprise my husband by doing everything nicely.

46:30.780 --> 46:32.370
Let's finish it wast"

46:33.061 --> 46:36.128
You'll do it very well, and you'll never be tired.

46:36.215 --> 46:40.244
And when you'll see your husband coming home
and seeing things done so well,

46:40.269 --> 46:44.149
so well, so happy.

46:44.308 --> 46:49.410
That joy of doing something to make someone happy

46:49.609 --> 46:56.956
will completely neutralize all your discomfort,
or the fatigue that you have.

46:58.147 --> 47:01.452
The other way round, also. The husband should also feel that

47:01.492 --> 47:05.926
"what could I do for her?"
A small little thing can make her happy.

47:07.071 --> 47:10.910
And the divorces here are all the time because

47:11.053 --> 47:17.282
of this kind of a nonsensical idea that

47:17.607 --> 47:21.914
"how much he has done, what I have done, what he has done."

47:22.160 --> 47:30.593
All the time weighing it out and making yourself miserable.

47:35.506 --> 47:38.759
I travel a lot as you know.

47:38.784 --> 47:44.061
I never feel I'm traveling, because I am there with Myself,

47:44.446 --> 47:47.898
whether I sit here or travel it's just the same.

47:47.954 --> 47:52.562
But if you think,  "I'm traveling",
then you feel,  "Oh God, I'm traveling!"

47:53.228 --> 47:55.876
But if you just think, "I'm sitting here in the chair;

47:55.901 --> 47:59.163
I'm sitting there in the chair", you don't feel tired.

47:59.814 --> 48:01.934
If you are doing some work,

48:01.934 --> 48:06.421
you feel tired when you start thinking,
"I am doing this work, I have done that work."

48:06.643 --> 48:11.386
Especially in Sahaja Yoga, if you think,
"I am doing any work" better not do it.

48:12.672 --> 48:16.946
But if you think, "I am doing nothing" and what joy -

48:19.958 --> 48:24.180
what joy it is! You'll become so energetic,

48:24.328 --> 48:31.190
because once you surrender,
then the Divine Power starts flowing through Me.

48:31.215 --> 48:34.943
That's why Mohammed Sahib has said,
"Islam means to surrender."

48:35.515 --> 48:38.354
He said it about Me also, that "I'll send you",

48:38.379 --> 48:40.036
He called Me the "Sent One."

48:40.679 --> 48:47.890
Everything He's talked about,
having vibrations and all that, in His own style,

48:48.025 --> 48:52.700
but He said that the message would be of surrender.

48:53.319 --> 48:55.862
And that surrendering part has to be there

48:55.887 --> 48:59.310
because Shri Krishna in Gita has very clearly said that,

48:59.335 --> 49:03.142
"Forget every dharma, just surrender yourself to Me."

49:05.618 --> 49:10.233
And that surrendering, if the Sahaja Yogis develop

49:11.106 --> 49:15.650
in America, the rest I'll look after.
But you leave it to Me to do it.

49:19.422 --> 49:22.829
And then ideas and everything will start flowing because

49:22.877 --> 49:27.464
this is Virata's place.
That's why you have such great scientists here,

49:27.631 --> 49:31.556
such great schools for all kinds of intellectual work

49:31.581 --> 49:35.166
and all that is here, while people are not wise.

49:35.397 --> 49:39.434
They are not wise at all. I've known people who-

49:39.532 --> 49:44.688
there's a, I met a president of Union Society,
he was eighty years of age,

49:44.839 --> 49:49.147
and he's supposed to be the President of the whole world.

49:51.411 --> 49:54.070
And he said, "I must see You privately."

49:54.095 --> 49:58.601
I said, "All right." He came to Me and

49:59.168 --> 50:04.858
his problem was so stupid that I just started looking at him.

50:04.883 --> 50:07.636
Eighty year old man, this stupid fellow!

50:08.309 --> 50:12.327
He's not even like a ten-year-old boy.

50:12.525 --> 50:18.250
No maturity of any kind. So immature.

50:18.796 --> 50:23.235
And when I saw him, I just had the glimpse of the whole thing,

50:23.362 --> 50:28.303
that "look at this man, eighty year old,
he's the Chairman of Union Society,

50:28.469 --> 50:32.674
he's - all over the world, people think
he's the Chairman of this thing."

50:32.699 --> 50:35.456
The chair may be better than him.

50:36.853 --> 50:40.030
Such a stupid fellow in a way.

50:40.278 --> 50:43.714
Such a stupid fellow that you can't imagine.

50:44.165 --> 50:46.109
So they might be intelligent,

50:46.125 --> 50:51.129
they might be well read,
they might be able to discover something out of matter,

50:51.681 --> 50:54.156
but they do not have wisdom.

50:54.442 --> 51:00.420
And the wisdom can only come through honest introspection.

51:01.983 --> 51:07.388
But it should not be also, "I'm catching on this chakra,
I'm catching on that chakra." Not that.

51:07.555 --> 51:13.158
But, "Why am I not seeing the point? What's the matter with me?

51:14.730 --> 51:17.823
Why can't I understand what is Sahaja Yoga?"

51:18.220 --> 51:23.384
Even when you have become Sahaja Yogis now for years together,

51:23.456 --> 51:26.756
still these old nonsensical things stick on to you,

51:26.781 --> 51:31.354
these ideas stick on to you. Why?

51:32.106 --> 51:39.080
Why do we not have that purity of Divine

51:39.105 --> 51:44.250
Discretion, which sees everything so clearly?

51:45.854 --> 51:51.186
So I think we need collectivity first of all,

51:51.917 --> 51:56.194
and secondly meditative honesty.

51:56.628 --> 52:00.647
Just to meditate, sit down before the photograph,
do the meditation - no!

52:01.121 --> 52:07.480
Meditation should act, should work.

52:07.953 --> 52:10.572
If it does not work, something wrong with you.

52:10.660 --> 52:12.199
Absolutely something wrong.

52:13.512 --> 52:18.658
If you feel everything is working all right,

52:19.253 --> 52:29.004
everything is miraculously showing its presence,

52:29.536 --> 52:33.021
presence of the Paramachaitanya, then you are all right.

52:33.046 --> 52:35.985
But if it is not so, if there are problems,

52:36.191 --> 52:39.902
then you're not, you're not a Sahaja Yogi.

52:41.116 --> 52:49.681
Sahaja Yogi is the one who is completely
connected with this Paramachaitanya.

52:52.677 --> 52:54.880
And for that age is no bar.

52:54.905 --> 53:00.908
I have seen girls who are only sixteen, seventeen, eighteen years so wise.

53:02.283 --> 53:09.568
Even small little children who were with Guido, I talked to them.

53:10.084 --> 53:12.898
I was surprised at their wisdom.

53:13.065 --> 53:18.003
So very wise, so beautiful.

53:20.115 --> 53:22.211
They understood human nature so well.

53:22.244 --> 53:29.707
Small little children about, they were at the most, ten years of age.

53:30.532 --> 53:33.239
And nice to talk to them.

53:35.293 --> 53:38.271
So that wisdom if they can have at that age,

53:38.296 --> 53:44.220
now we are also, all of us are about ten years old
Sahaja Yogis, minimum, nothing else.

53:45.969 --> 53:55.464
But still we are struggling, ambitious and wrong priorities.

53:56.625 --> 53:59.354
There is no need to have any ambition.

53:59.379 --> 54:03.952
Ambition is an imaginary thing.

54:04.190 --> 54:06.912
But Sahaja Yoga is reality.

54:07.466 --> 54:10.338
Everything works out.

54:10.790 --> 54:13.900
Everything sorts itself.

54:14.035 --> 54:16.439
Everything plans out.

54:16.464 --> 54:20.566
But to feel that if this is so,

54:20.868 --> 54:23.828
as I said in a small room  there are twelve people,

54:24.058 --> 54:28.565
it's something for the good. Why not?

54:30.866 --> 54:36.052
We have to be there. If I've lost the way, supposing,

54:38.779 --> 54:40.830
then I would say I have to go this way.

54:41.011 --> 54:45.200
This time we made a ticket which was
little wrong according to everyone

54:45.225 --> 54:47.493
because we had to go through Phoenix.

54:47.595 --> 54:52.785
But nice because I felt the vibrations of Phoenix,
I had to go that way.

54:53.571 --> 54:55.804
I had to see that.

54:57.966 --> 55:02.024
So always to find something smooth,

55:02.279 --> 55:07.806
the way we want it to be smooth, is not the way of Sahaja Yoga.

55:08.060 --> 55:16.081
Whatever we get it, we see the hand of the Divine behind it.

55:16.846 --> 55:19.558
What is our purpose of life?

55:19.962 --> 55:28.396
Our purpose of life is to save people,
save the Americans, minimum of minimums.

55:28.396 --> 55:31.352
Not the world, but at least start with Americans.

55:31.377 --> 55:35.492
That's our purpose of life. That's our identity.

55:35.705 --> 55:42.705
While doing that, there is Paramachaitanya
which is going to look after you completely.

55:43.365 --> 55:47.809
But first you put yourself before everything else,

55:47.857 --> 55:53.189
"I must have this, I must have that, I must have this."
It won't work out.

55:54.890 --> 55:58.749
Then, "I have this problem, I jumped into bankruptcy,

55:58.758 --> 56:02.067
I had that problem, I just couldn't manage."

56:02.092 --> 56:09.092
Because you have put other things before your "self". "

56:09.925 --> 56:12.147
Self" means the Spirit.

56:12.570 --> 56:16.671
According to people, "self" means selfishness,

56:16.806 --> 56:20.298
but according to Sahaja Yoga, "self" means your Spirit.

56:21.648 --> 56:27.758
So today's lecture should not be that
we hear from one ear and goes through the same one,

56:27.861 --> 56:33.013
but should we little bit ponder about it
and listen to it again and again.

56:34.068 --> 56:39.298
I have great hopes for you.
I have worked very hard in America, very much.

56:40.004 --> 56:42.210
But it has never been

56:42.931 --> 56:46.543
that state where I could say,"Now I can trigger something.

56:48.858 --> 56:52.610
" Even if there are few Sahaja Yogis
who are very deep and good,

56:52.635 --> 56:58.038
they are pulled down by others -
by jealousies, by this, by that.

57:01.264 --> 57:04.305
It's not the number that you are  but

57:04.939 --> 57:08.410
the quality that you are, first of all.

57:10.160 --> 57:13.445
But in Russia, I found it so easy, so very easy.

57:14.200 --> 57:17.931
It was wonderful, unbelievable.

57:18.420 --> 57:21.446
I've been only there thrice, can you imagine?

57:21.661 --> 57:24.560
And now Sahaja Yoga is a religion throughout.

57:24.576 --> 57:27.964
Everyone knows Me in Russia.

57:31.337 --> 57:37.741
But here people only know Rajneesh
or that Muktananda, all horrible people.

57:40.945 --> 57:45.996
Now, you can also say that,
"Mother, it's a question of advertising."

57:46.398 --> 57:50.184
That here the people, the way they advertise
and manipulate, and all that.

57:50.367 --> 57:57.964
But it only works out in places
where people are not seeking reality.

58:00.090 --> 58:03.265
Why can't they see that this is all publicity?

58:03.981 --> 58:05.821
They have no discretion?

58:06.338 --> 58:09.083
Supposing tomorrow they say, "This is the hair style." Then all

58:09.108 --> 58:11.419
Americans are in the same hair style.

58:11.444 --> 58:13.865
You can't make them out who is who.

58:14.207 --> 58:17.282
Or they say "this is the way the dress has to be."

58:17.417 --> 58:19.980
All Americans will be dressed up that way.

58:20.166 --> 58:21.752
I mean it's a slavery.

58:22.030 --> 58:25.106
Today's entrepreneurs, and through all this advertisement,

58:25.209 --> 58:27.477
any kind of advertisement.

58:27.611 --> 58:30.769
If that enamors people so much,

58:30.913 --> 58:33.653
that means we are fools, we are stupid,

58:33.802 --> 58:38.042
we are idiots that we cannot think for ourselves.

58:38.176 --> 58:40.136
Anybody can befool us.

58:40.256 --> 58:43.232
Anybody can put up anything in the market.

58:43.319 --> 58:45.827
Anything they talk about, we'll jump at it

58:45.860 --> 58:50.146
as if we have no brains to understand, to take to it.

58:52.281 --> 58:55.370
It's like we have no roots.

58:56.021 --> 59:01.351
We are just like some weeds which are thrown from this end to that end.

59:02.733 --> 59:08.098
But in Sahaja Yoga, your roots must grow much, much faster than anybody else,

59:08.518 --> 59:12.897
because this is the land of Shri Krishna.

59:15.215 --> 59:20.102
How many things He has done in His lifetime we have to see.

59:21.299 --> 59:28.299
As a child He killed so many demons,
while all demons are invited here.

59:29.549 --> 59:36.005
As a child He raised the Kundalini of all the Gopis and everyone.

59:37.834 --> 59:44.378
He played all kinds of beautiful tricks to amuse people as a child.

59:46.727 --> 59:52.022
And later on, He killed His own uncle.

59:54.604 --> 01:00:02.455
Which shows one thing -
an uncle in Indian families is the nearest person.

01:00:02.683 --> 01:00:05.470
In the marriage, it is the uncle who gives the daughter,

01:00:05.495 --> 01:00:10.479
it is the uncle who performs most of the rituals and everything.

01:00:10.504 --> 01:00:13.581
The uncle is the nearest person.

01:00:14.272 --> 01:00:18.140
And He killed His own uncle.

01:00:19.406 --> 01:00:27.005
Shows that He finished off all these artificial relationships.

01:00:30.751 --> 01:00:36.568
And then we find in America there are people

01:00:36.680 --> 01:00:39.433
who have done this kind of thing is to

01:00:39.497 --> 01:00:44.169
have nothing to do with the mother,
have nothing to do with father, have nothing to do with

01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:50.023
sister or wife, husband, children, anyone.

01:00:53.230 --> 01:00:57.245
But for what? For what have they given up?

01:00:58.245 --> 01:01:02.192
They gave it up for selfishness. For money.

01:01:02.495 --> 01:01:05.391
Not for something higher.

01:01:05.923 --> 01:01:11.730
Just the opposite of what
Shri Krishna did is to kill His own uncle because,

01:01:13.071 --> 01:01:19.563
to deliver His parents from their prison and also to kill a demon.

01:01:20.048 --> 01:01:21.885
He was a demon.

01:01:25.152 --> 01:01:28.135
So in our own understanding,

01:01:28.659 --> 01:01:37.774
if we understand one thing: that we are living on the soil,

01:01:38.092 --> 01:01:45.287
or on the soil of that country which is blessed by Shri Krishna,

01:01:48.747 --> 01:01:52.286
Who is called as Yogeshwara.

01:01:55.077 --> 01:02:02.936
So the first part was that when He destroyed all these things,

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.375
he was a Yogeshwara.

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:14.760
He was the Divine Energy for yoga,

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:20.371
for union with the Divine Power.

01:02:21.773 --> 01:02:26.268
He was the Ishwara. He is the Deity.

01:02:27.086 --> 01:02:31.981
If He was a Deity and He's the One Who is the ruler of this area,

01:02:32.094 --> 01:02:35.284
then what should we be?

01:02:35.855 --> 01:02:38.541
In yoga, we should be masters.

01:02:39.915 --> 01:02:43.684
Not mentally

01:02:45.615 --> 01:02:49.790
but at that state, of the higher state.

01:02:51.607 --> 01:02:53.716
If that could be achieved,

01:02:56.883 --> 01:03:02.109
then you people should become the highest of highest yogis.

01:03:02.260 --> 01:03:08.140
Because you have that power existing in this place. It is there.

01:03:08.860 --> 01:03:13.107
So many have told Me that, "Mother, now don't You worry about,

01:03:15.179 --> 01:03:18.624
don't You worry about America. Just forget it.

01:03:18.649 --> 01:03:21.644
Why to waste time in America?

01:03:22.758 --> 01:03:26.374
It's not going to work out. It's useless."

01:03:26.548 --> 01:03:32.095
But I know such a lot of power exists
in this country of the Yogeshwara,

01:03:33.192 --> 01:03:37.148
and if you can use that power of Yogeshwara,

01:03:37.879 --> 01:03:45.101
you can do so much good to the whole humanity at this juncture

01:03:45.594 --> 01:03:49.288
when the history is taking another fall.

01:03:50.923 --> 01:03:54.921
Now those who rise in spirituality -

01:03:54.953 --> 01:03:58.452
everybody is now today talking of spirituality,

01:03:59.909 --> 01:04:03.214
even Prince of Wales the other day was talking

01:04:03.239 --> 01:04:06.495
that "We should take to spirituality not to so much materialism

01:04:06.514 --> 01:04:10.712
that has caused us ecological problems and things like that."

01:04:10.895 --> 01:04:13.306
Everybody's talking of spirituality,

01:04:13.330 --> 01:04:16.330
and you are the ones who have it with you.

01:04:16.909 --> 01:04:19.295
You are the ones who have powers with you.

01:04:19.605 --> 01:04:21.740
You are the ones who can spread it.

01:04:21.765 --> 01:04:25.397
And once you start spreading it,

01:04:25.469 --> 01:04:30.759
you'll be surprised how you will achieve

01:04:31.325 --> 01:04:38.538
tremendous heights in every sphere, in every walk of life.

01:04:39.543 --> 01:04:43.296
So your identity is that you are Sahaja Yogis

01:04:43.630 --> 01:04:47.979
and you have to use the power of Yogeshwara,

01:04:48.306 --> 01:04:52.563
Who is the presiding Deity of this country.

01:04:54.758 --> 01:04:58.091
I bless you all that you have that wisdom,

01:04:58.116 --> 01:05:00.083
that depth, to touch your depth.

01:05:00.092 --> 01:05:09.081
Somehow try to work it out, stop all nonsensical fights and things.

01:05:09.106 --> 01:05:13.684
Become collective. Try to understand each other.

01:05:14.057 --> 01:05:16.349
Try to open your hearts.

01:05:16.374 --> 01:05:19.706
You have such depth. You are born in this country

01:05:19.812 --> 01:05:23.093
because the Yogeshwara wanted you to be here

01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:27.577
and He has blessed you with all the bounties of His love.

01:05:29.652 --> 01:05:34.870
Now it is for you to use that tremendous power:

01:05:35.993 --> 01:05:38.907
but without love, we can.

01:05:39.011 --> 01:05:46.594
Because he was the embodiment of madhurya, sweetness,

01:05:49.771 --> 01:05:50.771
sweetness.

01:05:51.428 --> 01:05:59.527
That madhurya you have to imbibe,
and that madhurya you have to spread.

01:06:02.532 --> 01:06:04.671
That's very important.

01:06:05.909 --> 01:06:10.924
So, that relationship of sweetness between each other,

01:06:11.465 --> 01:06:15.456
the relation of enjoying each other,

01:06:16.155 --> 01:06:21.813
the relation of knowing each other,

01:06:22.872 --> 01:06:31.162
has to be full of sweetness, just like honey.

01:06:34.891 --> 01:06:43.233
It is just there, but we have to be the bee to reach there.

01:06:43.781 --> 01:06:46.455
And I am sure it will work out.

01:06:47.929 --> 01:06:50.916
It should work out for all of you.

01:06:51.893 --> 01:06:56.444
So those who run away from collectivity should be very careful.

01:06:56.508 --> 01:06:58.307
They are not Sahaja Yogis

01:06:58.324 --> 01:07:02.331
and if they continue like this, they'll be just thrown out.

01:07:02.585 --> 01:07:05.248
They will be nowhere in Sahaja Yoga, I tell you.

01:07:05.941 --> 01:07:14.250
So you have to, first of all, understand that to be in Sahaja Yoga

01:07:15.667 --> 01:07:22.996
is only possible if we are having that depth,

01:07:23.101 --> 01:07:28.647
because a new jump is needed in Sahaja Yoga which will work out,

01:07:28.695 --> 01:07:32.856
which is working out and many will be thrown out.

01:07:34.308 --> 01:07:39.326
You have to jump, and for that jumping you really need people

01:07:39.359 --> 01:07:46.736
who are honest and deep and serious.

01:07:47.689 --> 01:07:53.100
Don't get lost onto frivolous things and worldly things.

01:07:53.195 --> 01:07:58.565
Just seek your depth. It's all there, so beautiful.

01:08:00.272 --> 01:08:03.132
So, may God bless you!
