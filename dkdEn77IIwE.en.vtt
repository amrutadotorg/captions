EnTc Peter VC 2019-0428

00:02.999 --> 00:07.040
Yesterday I was talking about two things, which

00:07.400 --> 00:12.080
we have to do in England, which one should understand, you see.

00:12.400 --> 00:15.080
Because every country has its own problems

00:15.400 --> 00:19.520
and we do absorb the problems.

00:20.000 --> 00:24.000
[Shri Mataji speaks aside in Hindi sounds like “Left hamari aur kar. Left hand, ha.]

00:24.760 --> 00:28.999
[In Hindi: Point your left hand towards Me,

00:29.720 --> 00:35.999
point your right hand outwards].

00:43.440 --> 00:49.640
Now the thing is our work is spreading very fast

00:50.800 --> 00:55.999
and people are taking to it.

00:57.320 --> 01:03.080
In Europe I find the land is much more fertile, surprisingly

01:04.920 --> 01:08.080
and once people get realization they become fantastic,

01:08.640 --> 01:11.640
I mean they think it’s something that they have been expecting

01:11.960 --> 01:15.960
and they understand Sahaj Yoga much better than we understand here.

01:16.440 --> 01:20.560
Though your Kundalinis rise very high, I’ve seen that,

01:20.800 --> 01:27.920
but the progress is not that all right.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.560
Now Ray has been to India, he’ll tell you how,

01:30.800 --> 01:33.040
what sort of people we have in India

01:33.400 --> 01:36.400
and how they have progressed themselves.

01:37.080 --> 01:41.999
Now as I said the main problem of our country is lethargy

01:42.200 --> 01:47.080
and lethargy is something we have to overcome somehow

01:47.680 --> 01:52.999
and this lethargy is a, actually a satanic force.

01:53.600 --> 01:57.560
It’s not lethargy only of the matter that comes from

01:57.800 --> 02:03.760
material domination on the Spirit, but it is really satanic

02:03.999 --> 02:10.000
because it stops your progress and is to be avoided.

02:10.440 --> 02:16.080
And to get out of it one has to be really alert about it,

02:16.320 --> 02:19.480
how it crawls onto you.

02:19.999 --> 02:23.999
Krishna has put, the worst vice in the whole world is “aalasya”,

02:24.120 --> 02:26.999
means lethargy. “Aalasyso Bijayate”

02:27.160 --> 02:29.320
– everything comes out of aalasya.

02:29.680 --> 02:32.680
According to Him, first the lethargy comes in

02:33.200 --> 02:36.680
and because of lethargy we get into vices

02:36.999 --> 02:40.999
and then we go to the right side also because of lethargy.

02:41.080 --> 02:45.720
Because just to avoid the lethargy we go to the right side too much.

02:45.999 --> 02:50.080
So according to Him everything starts with lethargy

02:50.320 --> 02:57.480
and then the person loses the essence of life through lethargy

02:57.920 --> 03:02.840
and this is our special quality and that is our real problem

03:02.999 --> 03:05.080
– is the lethargy.

03:05.400 --> 03:08.920
Because Sahaj Yoga is a thing where we say there is “akriya”.

03:09.000 --> 03:13.000
We don’t have to do anything. It is effortless.

03:13.360 --> 03:17.320
Everything works out effortless, spontaneously.

03:17.560 --> 03:22.040
So we think that everything is going to work out for us spontaneously.

03:22.600 --> 03:28.600
Only the Kundalini Jagruti is spontaneous for the first time,

03:28.999 --> 03:32.600
not for the second time, only for the first time.

03:32.920 --> 03:37.440
That is I have to do it or My photograph has to do it.

03:37.840 --> 03:40.440
But afterwards you have to work,

03:40.760 --> 03:43.240
you have to keep your Kundalini afloat.

03:43.520 --> 03:45.880
You have to understand what are your problems,

03:46.040 --> 03:48.760
what are you getting into.

03:48.999 --> 03:53.000
I mean, individually every one of you is a masterpiece,

03:53.280 --> 03:58.280
individually. Because of lethargy you are clouded.

03:58.999 --> 04:03.760
Secondly because of lethargy you are secluded,

04:03.999 --> 04:06.320
lethargy gives you also ego.

04:06.560 --> 04:08.999
Because anything that challenges lethargy

04:09.160 --> 04:13.000
you get on top of that person, you don’t like such a person.

04:13.320 --> 04:15.960
But the lethargy also those do not have

04:16.120 --> 04:20.080
are the people their attention is not on spiritual development.

04:20.560 --> 04:22.999
Theirs is as I told you yesterday, on other things,

04:23.200 --> 04:26.200
which are not important to spiritual life.

04:26.760 --> 04:31.320
We pay so much attention to other things than to our spiritual life.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.520
Why is it? Why is it we pay more attention to material things,

04:35.760 --> 04:39.760
to material comforts, to material achievements,

04:39.999 --> 04:45.440
to material obsessions? Why? You must think about it.

04:45.800 --> 04:47.800
And why not to our spiritual ascent?

04:47.999 --> 04:52.760
The reason is we have been identified with matter.

04:53.999 --> 04:57.560
We have been going through that circle.

04:57.960 --> 05:01.200
We thought that we must have material development,

05:01.560 --> 05:05.880
so we had industrial revolution, we created a society

05:06.000 --> 05:10.000
dominated by industries, machinery came up.

05:10.320 --> 05:12.999
We saw the machinery started dominating us.

05:13.200 --> 05:17.200
We wanted to misidentify from that machinery.

05:18.000 --> 05:21.200
Machinery has also given us lethargy

05:21.520 --> 05:25.720
because we use machine made things our hands do not work.

05:25.999 --> 05:28.999
We have lost all the deftness of the hands;

05:29.040 --> 05:32.120
we have lost all the walking capacity.

05:32.360 --> 05:37.360
We can only take a bus or a car; we do not want to walk at all.

05:38.080 --> 05:42.520
Now this mechanization and the use of matter too much,

05:42.760 --> 05:50.360
has made us sort of matters ourself. We have become matter

05:50.760 --> 05:54.760
that we cannot live without it, it, yet we are so identified with it.

05:55.080 --> 05:59.280
After realization if you are still identified with the matter,

05:59.760 --> 06:05.320
then your realization slows down. So to, one has to understand,

06:05.640 --> 06:13.640
one has to understand fully that matter is absolutely secondary.

06:15.760 --> 06:19.200
Without of course getting your body you cannot receive realization,

06:19.440 --> 06:21.320
you have to have your body.

06:21.560 --> 06:24.560
But matter which is gross, is of no meaning.

06:24.840 --> 06:28.720
Subtle matter is all right for us, that’s important.

06:28.960 --> 06:31.920
Like this light, which is burning, is important.

06:32.080 --> 06:35.999
Water that is in the ocean is all right.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.999
The sky, open sky – say here it is not so good

06:40.360 --> 06:42.999
but if you go to a country is even better.

06:43.200 --> 06:46.680
The Mother Earth say example here, I don’t know how it is,

06:46.999 --> 06:51.999
but in India certain places Mother Earth is very much subtle,

06:52.160 --> 06:55.080
your material identifications.

06:55.360 --> 06:58.999
So matter has been identified with us, we have been using it,

06:59.200 --> 07:02.720
living with it and that’s why it is easy for us to get back

07:02.999 --> 07:04.999
into the same circle of matter.

07:06.360 --> 07:09.240
And we get into it, we pay attention more to it.

07:09.600 --> 07:12.000
Now if I say, “Do not pay attention to it more,” then

07:12.240 --> 07:16.920
you go on to another side, in a subtler way you jump into vices.

07:17.000 --> 07:27.999
Vices of – I can say uncleanliness, filth, dirt, mismanagement.

07:29.400 --> 07:32.400
So from one extreme to another extreme you go.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.880
Now in the center what is matter, we should understand, and

07:35.999 --> 07:41.999
we should try to then identify ourselves with our Spirit.

07:42.520 --> 07:45.400
Now what is matter? Let us find out.

07:45.640 --> 07:50.640
What is matter this. And what is created out of matter?

07:51.240 --> 07:54.240
Matter you know is made out of five elements.

07:54.720 --> 08:00.640
You know the five elements, which have made this body of ours.

08:00.880 --> 08:04.720
And these five elements are on the right-hand side

08:04.960 --> 08:05.960
of the human beings

08:06.960 --> 08:14.760
and these five elements either push you towards the left side

08:14.999 --> 08:17.440
or pull you towards the right side.

08:17.680 --> 08:20.920
I mean to say that when your start using the matter

08:21.000 --> 08:23.840
gradually you become lethargic.

08:24.000 --> 08:27.040
You become slave to it, it forms a habit.

08:27.440 --> 08:31.240
If you use a chair then you cannot sit on the ground.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.520
If you are used to a comfortable life,

08:33.760 --> 08:37.760
you cannot live in an uncomfortable life. Sort of it slaves you.

08:38.200 --> 08:43.840
Secondly, if you try to overpower the matter,

08:44.040 --> 08:48.600
getting overactive with matter, you make everything properly

08:48.840 --> 08:51.440
and make everything nicely and everything;

08:51.680 --> 08:55.000
you are over efficient with the matter,

08:55.560 --> 08:59.760
then your ego develops and when your ego develops

08:59.999 --> 09:02.999
you go into violence.

09:03.160 --> 09:06.320
Because if you produce more, you have to be violent about it

09:06.560 --> 09:09.000
otherwise you do not know how to sell it.

09:09.280 --> 09:16.840
You become, sort-of an aggressive businessman or a country,

09:17.040 --> 09:21.040
which tries to sell the matter, which tries to overpower

09:21.280 --> 09:25.000
other nations with their material advancement.

09:25.680 --> 09:29.999
With violence you go little further, then

09:30.200 --> 09:34.320
what becomes out of you is nothing but you become materialistic.

09:34.640 --> 09:38.000
And materialistic people have no heart.

09:38.320 --> 09:41.999
A materialistic person has no heart. He is just dried out.

09:42.200 --> 09:45.520
He only understands money, money and money.

09:45.760 --> 09:48.999
He doesn’t go beyond it. So too much attachment to money

09:49.080 --> 09:54.080
is also materialistic, waste of money is also materialistic;

09:54.400 --> 09:57.360
mismanagement of money is the worst of all.

09:57.600 --> 10:04.600
So to be materialistic is your nature. You have started with it.

10:05.400 --> 10:07.279
That’s human nature to be materialistic

10:07.360 --> 10:08.999
because we have started with matter.

10:09.160 --> 10:13.320
But it is also the human nature to ascend.

10:13.720 --> 10:18.000
As it is natural to be a beast,

10:18.640 --> 10:22.640
it is more natural to be a Sahaj Yogi.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.200
So both things are part of the nature.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.999
Now which way you go is the thing.

10:27.120 --> 10:30.120
Now the ladder can take you up or can bring you down.

10:30.760 --> 10:33.680
If you have to go up your eyes should be upward.

10:33.920 --> 10:36.680
Now these five elements create what within you?

10:36.999 --> 10:40.840
They create the five chakras within you or you can say

10:40.999 --> 10:47.920
the six chakras are created out of these five elements.

10:48.440 --> 10:54.800
And these five elements, when they create the chakras

10:55.640 --> 11:06.000
then they also give us a support to have the deities’ aasana,

11:06.240 --> 11:12.040
a seat for the deities to come in. So they are important.

11:12.520 --> 11:16.160
But if you have to give a deity a seat,

11:16.560 --> 11:21.000
you do not give some sort of a filthy seat.

11:21.760 --> 11:24.999
You give a nice, the best seat,

11:25.200 --> 11:31.000
whatever is available, to the deity.

11:31.560 --> 11:38.560
So you must know that when you are using the matter,

11:38.880 --> 11:43.000
see the auspiciousness of it.

11:43.920 --> 11:47.440
You have to know the auspiciousness of things that you are using,

11:47.720 --> 11:52.000
whether it is auspicious or not. At random we buy clothes.

11:52.680 --> 11:56.360
At random we buy things.

11:57.200 --> 11:59.840
If you could use your vibratory awareness

12:00.000 --> 12:05.960
to buy your things to see what you should buy, what would look nice

12:06.000 --> 12:09.520
because beauty and auspiciousness goes hand in hand.

12:09.800 --> 12:11.480
They are not two things.

12:11.720 --> 12:15.520
Because beauty is a thing that gives joy to your Spirit,

12:15.880 --> 12:19.040
auspiciousness is the same, which gives joy to your Spirit.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.960
All other beauty is no beauty.

12:23.000 --> 12:26.240
So for a Sahaj Yogi it is necessary to use

12:26.480 --> 12:31.600
all the matters, which are auspicious.

12:32.800 --> 12:35.640
Now auspicious matters, whatever are there,

12:35.880 --> 12:41.000
which are important matters must be kept at a higher level always.

12:41.400 --> 12:47.000
For example say My photograph, is very auspicious.

12:47.240 --> 12:53.000
Then you don’t put it on the ground, then don’t trample over it.

12:54.160 --> 12:58.160
In that also there are gradations of auspiciousness.

12:58.480 --> 13:04.720
But now your clothes because you are saints now, are very important.

13:05.120 --> 13:11.120
You are saints do you realize? Do you realize your self-esteem?

13:11.360 --> 13:14.560
You are saints now. What clothes you wear?

13:14.800 --> 13:18.480
you are not vagabonds. You are not tramps.

13:18.720 --> 13:24.880
You are not on the street. So you have to wear dignified dress.

13:25.160 --> 13:28.320
I have told everyone of you that, “Wear something dignified,

13:28.560 --> 13:31.040
not indignified.”

13:31.360 --> 13:35.520
It has to be majestic, because you are a saint now.

13:35.880 --> 13:38.520
You are no more a person running on the street,

13:38.760 --> 13:42.000
you are the selected saints by God.

13:42.640 --> 13:47.800
So a dress you wear need not be absurd or something funny

13:47.999 --> 13:51.000
but should give you dignity.

13:52.360 --> 13:56.720
Not any false but a real dignity. You see the vibrations of a dress.

13:56.999 --> 13:58.960
Wear your country’s dress.

13:59.000 --> 14:01.479
You need not wear somebody else’s dress or something,

14:01.560 --> 14:03.960
but the interest in the dress should be that

14:04.000 --> 14:09.000
it should give you dignity and a sense of respectability.

14:09.520 --> 14:15.000
It is to preserve your respect that you have to wear a dress.

14:15.280 --> 14:17.800
That is the utility of a dress.

14:17.999 --> 14:22.200
And now you go to another thing, anything that you are using,

14:22.440 --> 14:24.960
for example your house.

14:25.000 --> 14:32.960
Your house should be a house of cheerfulness, a house of dignity

14:33.040 --> 14:36.960
where people come in, they have comfort, they sit comfortably.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.440
But too much comfort is against Sahaj Yoga.

14:40.960 --> 14:43.320
But spartan also is not necessary

14:43.560 --> 14:46.999
that you do not have anything to spread on the ground or something.

14:47.120 --> 14:50.960
It should be comfortable. But it should not be comfort personified,

14:51.000 --> 14:52.840
because comfort creeps on you.

14:52.999 --> 14:55.480
Comfort is one thing is better for English people

14:55.720 --> 14:59.999
to avoid completely, is very good for them not to allow the body

15:00.080 --> 15:03.120
to get into comfortable positions.

15:03.600 --> 15:05.320
Specially bathroom addiction is

15:05.560 --> 15:07.999
too much in English people I have seen it.

15:08.120 --> 15:09.999
It is so much so I was so surprised that

15:10.080 --> 15:14.440
if I go supposing to a reception

15:14.521 --> 15:16.960
I can tell you whether it is owned by an Englishman

15:17.000 --> 15:19.999
or by somebody else. If it is owned by an Englishman,

15:20.080 --> 15:21.918
the bathroom will be done up very well,

15:21.999 --> 15:24.999
there will be towel for everything, soap for everything,

15:25.080 --> 15:28.880
I mean they are extremely particular.

15:30.720 --> 15:34.040
And immediately I know that it is done by some English gentleman,

15:34.280 --> 15:38.520
because they are very bathroom conscious.

15:40.440 --> 15:45.320
Though they do not take baths.

15:46.800 --> 15:50.000
I have seen houses with sixty bedrooms and

15:50.240 --> 15:54.040
no bath in England only. Now of course they have started.

15:54.280 --> 15:57.480
Bathing is not their quality.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.999
But bathroom – they are very particular.

16:01.080 --> 16:03.676
And even if you put an easy chair they wouldn’t mind

16:03.800 --> 16:05.800
sitting in a bathroom.

16:08.040 --> 16:11.240
And as far as bathroom is concerned

16:11.720 --> 16:14.040
one should just form such habits,

16:14.320 --> 16:18.520
that within ten minutes you should be out from the bathroom.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.999
Now when I say you have to take your baths,

16:21.080 --> 16:23.506
that doesn’t mean that early in the morning go and take a shower,

16:23.587 --> 16:26.040
it doesn’t mean that. You should take a bath at a time

16:26.280 --> 16:29.960
when you’ll have one hour before going out,

16:30.200 --> 16:32.520
but that also from auspicious point of view.

16:32.760 --> 16:37.880
Now you are saints, so use water as much as you can.

16:38.120 --> 16:41.680
Wash your hands ten times is very essential.

16:41.816 --> 16:44.745
To get your vibrations all right, you must wash your hands.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.520
But now in India there are people

16:46.760 --> 16:50.999
who wash their hands countingly sixty four times.

16:51.320 --> 16:53.999
And I always warn about the another side of it,

16:54.080 --> 16:56.688
like doctors go on washing their hands. In the same way,

16:56.769 --> 16:59.079
there are some people who go on washing their hands.

16:59.160 --> 17:02.280
You need not take out the skin out of your hands.

17:02.520 --> 17:07.360
But as many times as you wash your hands, it is a good thing.

17:07.840 --> 17:09.999
I mean you are saints but you are children.

17:10.200 --> 17:14.840
And I have to talk to you as to the children who are saints.

17:14.999 --> 17:18.960
It’s a big complication. While you are grown up people

17:19.000 --> 17:22.120
and sometimes you might feel hurt also, the way I have to tell you,

17:22.360 --> 17:27.960
but this is important that you have to understand that

17:28.040 --> 17:32.240
“We are saints and as saints, what we have to do as far as

17:32.600 --> 17:40.360
the matter is concerned.” Now in a house there should be no dirt.

17:41.000 --> 17:46.680
Dirt is not the sign of a saintliness. Miserliness: dirt -

17:46.920 --> 17:53.000
you come to somebody’s house and you find a miserable beggary hole.

17:53.480 --> 17:57.480
That kind of a thing should not be. You must have proper plates,

17:57.760 --> 18:01.560
proper things or a broken plate somewhere, no.

18:01.800 --> 18:05.999
All these things should be clean, neat, maybe handmade,

18:06.160 --> 18:08.000
or even if you don’t get handmade,

18:08.240 --> 18:10.280
but they should be clean, auspicious.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.000
If you can get handmade things, nothing like it.

18:13.240 --> 18:17.000
That’s a very good idea if you can get hand made things and if you

18:17.240 --> 18:20.000
can use them it’s very good.

18:20.840 --> 18:23.800
I think we went to see Gandhiji’s ashram, didn’t we?

18:23.999 --> 18:27.800
You saw it was a simple place but very well done, everything.

18:27.999 --> 18:30.960
And that way Japanese are very good at these things;

18:31.000 --> 18:33.520
one has to learn a lot from them. You have to learn

18:33.760 --> 18:37.960
from so many people and because of Zen influence, the Japanese

18:38.000 --> 18:42.000
picked up the aesthetics of life. Very simple house they will have

18:42.240 --> 18:46.960
but everything very comfortable. And they know how to make

18:47.000 --> 18:53.000
the house look beautiful and how to make people feel comfortable.

19:14.240 --> 19:20.999
Matter is to be treated with respect because it is created by God.

19:21.200 --> 19:27.960
But whatever is respected is to be respected – not everything.

19:28.320 --> 19:32.040
Everything in the matter is not to be respected.

19:32.280 --> 19:38.999
For example, if you see some sort of a painting,

19:39.120 --> 19:43.960
which is not auspicious, is not auspicious.

19:44.000 --> 19:46.719
You should refuse to see such a painting. You should avoid

19:46.800 --> 19:49.960
seeing such painting because it is not going to give you any joy,

19:50.000 --> 19:53.000
any happiness, nothing. It’s not going to work out.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.920
Now one of the things which people always tell Me

19:55.999 --> 20:02.040
that in … “Sahaj Yogis do not have a presence."

20:03.999 --> 20:12.000
This is a very important thing. The presence is done by matter.

20:12.720 --> 20:18.000
Now our presence, if it is not all right people can make it out.

20:18.360 --> 20:21.960
All things that are in us,

20:22.000 --> 20:24.280
if they become auspicious will have a presence.

20:24.520 --> 20:29.000
Wherever we’ll stand people will know there’s a presence.

20:30.999 --> 20:37.000
And this presence is a blessing of the matter to us.

20:37.880 --> 20:40.999
So you must respect matter in the sense what clothes you wear.

20:41.080 --> 20:43.999
Throwing clothes on the ground, throwing here and there,

20:44.080 --> 20:46.999
living like a donkey, like a pigsty,

20:47.080 --> 20:51.000
is not the way a Sahaj Yogi should live.

20:51.600 --> 20:55.999
He has to be orderly; he has to respect his clothes.

20:56.080 --> 20:58.960
But it should not be that you respect your clothes so much

20:59.000 --> 21:02.279
that you throw away others’ clothes.
The others are Sahaj Yogis also.

21:02.360 --> 21:05.640
You have to respect each other because you are all saints.

21:05.920 --> 21:10.960
If you respect yourself you have to respect others.

21:12.040 --> 21:15.960
And once you start respecting the matter,

21:16.000 --> 21:19.440
which is the essence in you, that is attention.

21:19.680 --> 21:22.960
The essence of matter is attention.

21:23.080 --> 21:30.280
Attention gives you the presence. For example –

21:30.680 --> 21:35.040
recently Marie was with Me. While translating Me, she suddenly

21:35.280 --> 21:38.999
saw some flowers here and there, she started putting them right.

21:39.200 --> 21:42.160
It created a very funny situation. Everybody started seeing

21:42.400 --> 21:46.999
what’s matter with this woman? But now she’s understood it.

21:47.080 --> 21:51.040
And now I told her that, “When you are speaking you should say it

21:51.280 --> 21:58.000
with full concentration. Your attention, where is your attention?”

21:59.960 --> 22:05.720
If your attention is on money, even if I am talking

22:06.000 --> 22:09.240
about the highest things you’ll be thinking about money.

22:09.480 --> 22:13.960
If your attention is on something else, even if I am talking

22:14.000 --> 22:17.960
to something, you will be thinking of something else.

22:18.000 --> 22:23.120
That’s why our presence should be such that nobody’s attention

22:23.360 --> 22:28.960
is diverted or deluded. You understand My point?

22:29.000 --> 22:32.240
If your presence is funny, like a joker or a clown

22:32.480 --> 22:37.999
or a funny, untidy, everybody’s attention will be disturbed.

22:38.200 --> 22:43.560
If you are overly dressed also the attention will be disturbed.

22:43.800 --> 22:48.760
But if you are completely a presence then wherever you stand,

22:48.999 --> 22:52.000
people will feel there is somebody standing, great.

22:52.280 --> 22:56.880
The respect flows, actually respect flows.

22:57.760 --> 23:01.800
And it is something so remarkable that you don’t know how people

23:01.999 --> 23:06.000
try to help you then and how it works out.

23:08.680 --> 23:15.840
Your attention if it is dominated by matter, people can make it out.

23:15.999 --> 23:20.280
And that is one thing has to look after very clearly because these

23:20.520 --> 23:27.000
are countries who have advanced so much in material advancement.

23:27.560 --> 23:30.760
So what happens, every matter attracts your attention.

23:30.999 --> 23:34.960
You go on the street there’s this one woman is standing

23:35.000 --> 23:37.759
or there is something selling, this happening. All the time

23:37.840 --> 23:41.960
the attention … You see it is their job to attract your attention,

23:42.000 --> 23:44.040
otherwise how are they going to exploit you?

23:44.280 --> 23:47.960
See, they will have no justification. So they produce things, they

23:48.000 --> 23:50.999
advertise things, to do in such a way to distract your attention.

23:51.120 --> 23:54.480
Now this is a force, which is acting against our attention.

23:54.840 --> 23:58.999
So as far as possible keep your attention straight,

23:59.120 --> 24:02.800
or on the Mother Earth. If you can control your attention,

24:02.999 --> 24:06.440
you can overcome your material domination.

24:06.920 --> 24:12.920
Now the best thing is to put attention to your Spirit.

24:13.999 --> 24:16.240
If you start putting your attention to Spirit,

24:16.353 --> 24:19.145
the sweetness of the Spirit itself will make the whole thing

24:19.226 --> 24:22.960
very sweet and beautiful. The attention should be in the Spirit.

24:23.000 --> 24:26.320
Even you are getting ready; keep the attention on the Spirit.

24:26.489 --> 24:29.425
Now it’s not difficult because Kundalini has reached that stage.

24:29.506 --> 24:32.330
Before realization if I had said it, then you would have said,

24:32.411 --> 24:36.000
“Mother, how to do it?” But now when you have got realization,

24:36.240 --> 24:40.000
try to bring your attention to Spirit.

24:40.280 --> 24:44.960
Means first when the Kundalini rises you start looking

24:45.000 --> 24:49.440
the Spirit or you say when you get realization you see the Spirit.

24:49.592 --> 24:52.213
In the sense that the Spirit starts flowing through you,

24:52.294 --> 24:55.174
you start watching its flowing in this thing.

24:55.440 --> 25:01.520
But then after some time, you must enter into Spirit and see

25:01.800 --> 25:05.840
through the window of the Spirit, the whole thing

25:05.999 --> 25:08.440
by developing your witness Spirit.

25:08.680 --> 25:12.880
If you develop your witness state,

25:13.240 --> 25:20.240
from attention you become knowledge, the truth.

25:22.360 --> 25:28.320
Then material things become the knowledge;

25:28.560 --> 25:32.960
aesthetics of matter start giving you joy.

25:33.000 --> 25:36.600
You do not want to possess it, but they start giving you joy

25:36.840 --> 25:42.240
and even if you want to possess it, it would be just to enjoy it

25:42.480 --> 25:44.999
and give it away to somebody else. It’s like that.

25:45.200 --> 25:52.000
It’s for your enjoyment and you want to give it away to someone else

25:52.640 --> 25:55.880
When you develop your witness state this will come to you

25:55.999 --> 25:59.999
that you will not keep things to yourself

26:00.200 --> 26:05.000
but you would like to give and share, sharing.

26:05.680 --> 26:08.999
That is the time you should know you have become a witness, because

26:09.040 --> 26:14.960
you're enjoying. Witness state is the state of Shri Krishna, of Virat.

26:15.000 --> 26:22.000
When you start sharing your things then it is a proper thing.

27:00.200 --> 27:13.000
Now the essence of puja is also how to overcome our material grossness.

27:13.360 --> 27:22.000
Puja is nothing but is how to overcome our material grossness.

27:23.000 --> 27:27.560
When we want to have a matter to ourselves,

27:28.600 --> 27:31.440
we must know that it is given to us by God.

27:31.720 --> 27:36.200
Everything belongs to God. Supposing we give flower to God,

27:36.440 --> 27:39.640
after all it is God’s own creation, what are we giving?

27:39.960 --> 27:44.520
We show light to God or do ‘aarti’ to God. What?

27:44.800 --> 27:49.000
It is all God’s light only, what do we do?

27:49.999 --> 28:00.000
But by showing light to God what we do is we worship light within us.

28:02.320 --> 28:07.200
The light element gets enlightened within us.

28:10.280 --> 28:16.280
The light element is here on the Agnya.

28:16.920 --> 28:21.960
When you do aarti, or when you put light before God,

28:22.000 --> 28:27.960
when you show light to God, the light element within you gets

28:28.000 --> 28:35.000
enlightened. When you give flowers, Mooladhara gets enlightened.

28:36.720 --> 28:43.999
When you get honey, then your attention gets enlightened.

28:44.280 --> 28:48.680
So, why we give it to God, after all God doesn’t need anything.

28:48.920 --> 28:53.000
But God is the enjoyer. You are not the enjoyer, you cannot enjoy.

28:53.280 --> 28:56.560
Enjoyer is God. In you, when God is there that enjoys,

28:56.800 --> 28:59.800
that is the Spirit.

29:02.440 --> 29:10.360
So whatever pleases your Spirit is used in the puja to be given.

29:10.640 --> 29:13.999
Now you give rice – all these things are discovered –

29:14.080 --> 29:18.800
that you give rice to the Devi. Rice should be put in Her lap.

29:18.999 --> 29:23.160
Now what is rice, a little rice to a Devi?

29:23.720 --> 29:29.040
Is, by putting rice, in you the satisfaction of getting food

29:29.280 --> 29:35.000
or food that gives you satisfaction is enlightened.

29:39.080 --> 29:41.999
But that doesn’t mean you start showering things on Me,

29:42.080 --> 29:44.920
that doesn’t mean that. What I am trying to say,

29:44.999 --> 29:49.480
do it with dignity and understanding. That you give Me rice.

29:49.720 --> 29:52.960
Now, rice giving – these people don’t understand

29:53.000 --> 29:58.680
why rice is to be given to God? After all, why give Him palm leaves?

29:58.920 --> 30:04.600
What is He going to do? If Christ was the Son of God.

30:04.840 --> 30:10.080
What was the use of putting palm leaves for Him?

30:11.040 --> 30:18.000
Or to give Him oil, oil bath or to rub His feet with oil?

30:18.440 --> 30:20.999
It is for you to get the advantage.

30:21.160 --> 30:22.999
Now in Sahaj yoga it is proved now.

30:23.080 --> 30:26.999
When you rub My feet, you feel better, not Me.

30:27.520 --> 30:29.960
You rub My hands, you feel better.

30:30.000 --> 30:32.960
When you fall at My feet, you feel better.

30:33.000 --> 30:36.800
She, she is a great – what was, what is, what were you doing?

30:36.999 --> 30:40.560
"Reflexology." Shri Mataji: Reflexology. Big name, ah? Reflexology.

30:40.641 --> 30:43.599
And she is supposed to know about the feet and things like that.

30:43.680 --> 30:48.280
One day she said, “Mother I want to come and massage Your feet.

30:48.361 --> 30:51.344
- I know this and all - that.” So I said, “All right, come along.”

30:51.425 --> 30:55.280
So she came to rub My feet. Instead of I feeling,

30:55.520 --> 30:57.960
becoming relaxed, she was becoming relaxed.

30:58.000 --> 31:00.999
The more she was rubbing she was getting relaxed.

31:01.080 --> 31:06.440
So you see when you do for God, the blessings comes to you.

31:06.800 --> 31:11.800
You are blessed. Whatever is the problem with you,

31:11.999 --> 31:15.080
you give to God to solve.

31:15.640 --> 31:19.760
Also whatever satisfies you, you give to God.

31:19.999 --> 31:22.040
The satisfaction comes to you.

31:22.880 --> 31:27.440
Now, these flowers when you give it to Me, Mooladhara.

31:27.680 --> 31:30.520
They give you two things, Swadishthana and Mooladhara.

31:30.760 --> 31:34.520
Flowers that’s why are very important. They give Swadishthana,

31:34.760 --> 31:37.520
if the flowers are beautiful, then they give Swadishthana

31:37.999 --> 31:41.520
and if they are fragrant they cure your Mooladhara.

31:41.760 --> 31:46.760
Now, I mean there is no end to flowers also.

31:47.600 --> 31:54.360
But think about it, that you are doing it to improve your chakras.

31:58.640 --> 32:04.520
Then other things that are used like say ghee. Ghee is used.

32:04.760 --> 32:10.560
It is for Vishuddhi. Shri Krishna is very fond of ghee and butter.

32:11.160 --> 32:14.000
So when you rub My feet with say butter,

32:14.560 --> 32:17.560
your Vishuddhi will improve, you know that.

32:17.800 --> 32:20.960
Not Mine, I have no problem. I have only one problem that

32:21.000 --> 32:24.000
you are within Me and when you have problem I have problems.

32:24.280 --> 32:26.999
Because these vibrations have to go to you.

32:27.200 --> 32:32.360
So I prepare vibrations here as an antidote and they have to flow.

32:33.920 --> 32:37.160
It’s a very subtle thing to understand.

32:37.400 --> 32:43.160
To move from gross to Spirit, this is the thing by which you move,

32:43.680 --> 32:46.560
because first you enlighten your chakras.

32:46.800 --> 32:52.800
By enlightening your chakras, your deities get happy, prasanna.

32:53.600 --> 32:57.960
By making the deities happy, you keep; get a passage

32:58.000 --> 33:00.999
for the Kundalini to pass through.

33:01.200 --> 33:05.760
By making the passage for the Kundalini, the Kundalini goes up

33:05.999 --> 33:10.760
and then your attention starts becoming one with the Spirit.

33:10.999 --> 33:15.800
It is step by step, you move from matter to subtler matter,

33:15.999 --> 33:20.720
from subtler matter to your chakras, from chakras to deities,

33:20.960 --> 33:28.000
from deities to the Spirit. Then Spirit enjoys itself.

33:28.520 --> 33:30.960
So there you do not have to do anything.

33:31.000 --> 33:33.000
Just give your Spirit to Spirit.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.639
That’s why these things were prescribed.

33:37.720 --> 33:40.520
Now people could not see this linkage.

33:40.760 --> 33:43.800
They thought that, “Why should we give anything to God?

33:44.240 --> 33:50.240
After all it is all His own.” The argument started.

33:51.520 --> 33:56.760
“Why should we put lights? There is no need.” But this is an escape.

33:56.999 --> 34:00.560
Where are you, at what stage? You are at a stage;

34:00.840 --> 34:09.000
you are at a stage where you have to detach yourself from matter.

34:12.200 --> 34:15.960
Same with Sahaj Yoga, I find it that you must understand

34:16.000 --> 34:18.080
the complete vision of Sahaj Yoga.

34:18.320 --> 34:24.680
It’s a very big thing you are doing. You are not small.

34:24.920 --> 34:26.960
You are doing a very great work,

34:27.000 --> 34:30.999
because it is 'the' solution of all the humanity.

34:31.040 --> 34:34.440
This is the solution of all the problems,

34:34.720 --> 34:38.000
whether political, economic or anything, whatever you call it.

34:38.240 --> 34:42.320
Is not only that but the more people you have,

34:42.560 --> 34:45.999
you will be surprised, I’ll work out much better.

34:46.040 --> 34:49.999
Collectively I can cure cancer if you are more, if you are

34:50.200 --> 34:54.120
clear people. But your channels are so full of problems

34:54.360 --> 34:59.040
that nothing flows through you. If you get yourself cleared out,

34:59.280 --> 35:03.680
collectively I can stop cancer spreading,

35:03.999 --> 35:06.760
because if you spread more vibrations,

35:06.999 --> 35:12.720
what happens that the left and right side in Virat becomes clearer

35:13.200 --> 35:16.200
and the attack from the left and right side which creates cancer,

35:16.440 --> 35:18.999
all these horrible diseases, will be less.

35:19.080 --> 35:22.000
Because there will be less.

35:22.580 --> 35:25.548
But you do not understand your responsibility what you are doing.

35:25.629 --> 35:29.840
You are playing into the hands of satanics.

35:29.999 --> 35:32.960
By not paying attention to your cleaning,

35:33.000 --> 35:37.760
by not paying attention to your spiritual growth,

35:37.999 --> 35:42.840
you are not helping Me at all because these vibrations do not flow out.

35:43.200 --> 35:46.320
They have to flow through you. If I could manage them

35:46.560 --> 35:50.600
there was no need for Me to run after you.

35:50.999 --> 35:53.240
It has to flow through you, you are the channels

35:53.480 --> 35:59.240
and if you do not keep yourself clean and humble and meek about it,

35:59.720 --> 36:03.440
it doesn’t work out. You are not helping Me at all by that.

36:03.680 --> 36:10.400
So the localized problem of yours limited problems, should be

36:10.640 --> 36:15.000
given up and see to the bigger problems that you’ll be solving.

36:15.560 --> 36:21.000
I can stop the happening of cancer completely

36:21.440 --> 36:24.000
if I have twenty-one thousand Sahaja Yogis.

36:24.280 --> 36:30.480
Completely, Cancer will go out of … leprosy I can control.

36:30.999 --> 36:32.999
Cancer already I am controlling,

36:33.120 --> 36:36.040
but it’ll go down, collectively also.

36:36.480 --> 36:41.200
I mean the statistics I’ve not seen but will go down.

36:42.120 --> 36:45.960
It’s a left side attack and the more you try to go to left side

36:46.000 --> 36:47.285
there will be more attacks.

36:47.366 --> 36:50.366
Right side attacks are also lots of these wars.

36:51.360 --> 36:53.560
All these wars and all these things take place

36:53.800 --> 36:55.840
because we are invaded from the right side.

36:56.120 --> 36:57.640
All these aggressive people

36:57.880 --> 37:01.240
like Hitler and all that are aggressing us.

37:01.600 --> 37:09.880
How much it is necessary for you to rise above your lower self.

37:10.240 --> 37:11.720
One should understand that

37:11.960 --> 37:15.520
and not to indulge into nonsense that you are doing.

37:15.760 --> 37:17.880
You have to really work hard for that.

37:17.999 --> 37:23.640
Even if you have to get up early in the morning, you have to get up and do it.

37:26.360 --> 37:30.640
You should understand your responsibilities, that’s the main point.

37:30.880 --> 37:34.400
People are now busy only doing jobs, working here, how much money

37:34.481 --> 37:37.393
you get, how much do you go, when do you go to job and all that.

37:37.474 --> 37:39.194
That’s not important for us.

37:39.480 --> 37:43.359
Now that doesn’t mean you give up your jobs and be a liability on the ashram,

37:43.440 --> 37:46.600
it doesn’t mean that! It means you do your jobs, have money,

37:46.840 --> 37:50.040
money is needed for the work. I need money, you know that how much

37:50.320 --> 37:51.999
money we need for all this work.

37:52.120 --> 37:54.999
You have taken such a big project of going to Europe

37:55.200 --> 37:57.320
having this little money.

37:57.560 --> 38:00.999
It’s not possible. But we are doing it somehow.

38:01.040 --> 38:04.200
So, we need money, you have to earn, you have to give;

38:04.440 --> 38:06.400
you have to give money. Here people are,

38:06.481 --> 38:08.599
they are not even willing to give ten pounds.

38:08.680 --> 38:14.640
Such people. With them where am I going to do Sahaj Yoga?

38:16.640 --> 38:20.040
We are so attached to money in a subtler way.

38:20.600 --> 38:25.280
We do not understand we have to give money and we have to do it up.

38:25.520 --> 38:27.999
Not only money, money’s not the only solution;

38:28.120 --> 38:30.160
we have to be ourselves channels.

38:30.440 --> 38:32.200
But then some people have money,

38:32.680 --> 38:37.440
then they are exploited in a wrong way and the money’s all wasted.

38:38.000 --> 38:40.960
This is precious money, this is auspicious money,

38:41.000 --> 38:45.480
this money goes into the right hands into right places.

38:45.720 --> 38:49.640
Problems are created because of that.

38:50.880 --> 38:54.520
Now this money I do not need, you know that very well.

38:54.920 --> 38:57.359
But for your own betterment you have to give money.

38:57.440 --> 38:58.960
Ask Gavin he’ll tell you.

38:59.000 --> 39:04.120
He’s a very generous man and he, he found it very good.

39:06.480 --> 39:08.720
It’s not that I need a single pai from you.

39:08.833 --> 39:11.759
On the contrary I am willing to spend My own money on things,

39:11.840 --> 39:13.520
you know that definitely.

39:13.760 --> 39:18.520
But, you must understand this work has to be done, so you need money.

39:18.721 --> 39:20.960
I need not tell you that you have to pay money.

39:21.000 --> 39:23.307
I have never said this to Indians, I have never told them.

39:23.388 --> 39:25.440
They have never given Me a problem you’ll be amazed.

39:25.521 --> 39:27.399
How they solve their problems God alone knows.

39:27.480 --> 39:28.839
They are not the people of money.

39:28.920 --> 39:31.560
There’s never a quarrel about money. Nobody talks about money,

39:31.641 --> 39:33.918
nobody tells Me anything, nothing of the kind.

39:33.999 --> 39:37.480
Nobody oppresses anyone or mishandles anyone

39:37.720 --> 39:40.827
or controls anyone, everybody does so well.

39:41.002 --> 39:44.119
Money is not with one person. Say about two, three people handle it.

39:44.200 --> 39:47.880
Everybody knows how much money they are taking.

39:48.240 --> 39:50.000
This one part is important.

39:50.240 --> 39:55.280
For solving this problem you give Me rice.

39:56.000 --> 39:57.520
It’s called as “Oti bharne,”

39:57.760 --> 40:03.760
that you give Me rice I beg of you, actually. You put it in My sari.

40:05.280 --> 40:09.280
Rice, you give Me five times, I give you seven times back.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.760
That’s the symbol. You know how symbols work out.

40:12.999 --> 40:16.760
Even when you say, “Mother are you the Holy Ghost?” it works out,

40:17.000 --> 40:20.000
it gives you realization.

40:21.160 --> 40:27.800
If there is somebody so alert and sensitive sitting before you,

40:27.999 --> 40:32.720
you must know how to do the symbols, how to do them properly,

40:32.960 --> 40:38.960
with full maturity, understanding, in the proper way.

40:39.440 --> 40:42.760
You are very anxious to do the puja, but do you understand,

40:42.999 --> 40:47.000
before the puja always there’s a quarrel going on.

40:47.480 --> 40:50.760
Somebody who is a very possessed person will come, to begin with,

40:50.999 --> 40:54.200
and everybody will start fighting. Imagine!

40:54.600 --> 40:58.760
You must take your bath, “What are you doing?”

40:59.280 --> 41:04.320
In the morning don’t talk to anyone. Be in hush condition.

41:04.560 --> 41:09.320
You are in for opening out to the great power,

41:09.600 --> 41:14.000
which is going to solve the problem of the world.

41:14.560 --> 41:20.400
So you cleanse yourself, you wash yourself; you cleanse yourself,

41:21.440 --> 41:25.000
so that you get your chakras evolved.

41:26.120 --> 41:30.640
People talked against it because they became only ritualistic,

41:30.880 --> 41:33.440
mechanical; matter became very important.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.999
Then only doing these things became important.

41:36.120 --> 41:41.160
But not now, you people are different. You are realized souls.

41:43.600 --> 41:46.439
That doesn’t mean that you should take to sanyasa or anything.

41:46.520 --> 41:49.600
You should, I’ve told you, you should live like normal people,

41:49.840 --> 41:51.920
but a very dignified people.

41:52.000 --> 41:58.200
Nothing of indignity, childishness, superfluousness or joker-like,

41:58.440 --> 42:02.200
clown-like, outstandingly funny, all these dresses should not be worn.

42:02.720 --> 42:05.799
You should be properly dressed in a way that you have a presence.

42:05.880 --> 42:08.880
I mean this is to a children I am telling you.

42:09.000 --> 42:12.520
You must have a presence of grown up Sahaja Yogis, You are all saints.

42:12.760 --> 42:14.999
You know such a lot even many saints do not know.

42:15.040 --> 42:17.760
You can go and ask so many of them.

42:18.000 --> 42:20.999
There’s one thing they know that I am that.

42:21.440 --> 42:27.999
That’s one thing you do not know. They know that.

42:28.320 --> 42:30.560
This is a big difference.

42:30.641 --> 42:33.399
Because I am easily available to you, you do not understand.

42:33.480 --> 42:37.240
For them I am great. As I told you yesterday that how these saints

42:37.680 --> 42:41.680
have recognized and they have sent people to help Me.

42:42.999 --> 42:47.000
In saintliness only, your recognition of Me is poor.

42:47.400 --> 42:50.520
Because if it was not, you would not be shouting in My presence,

42:50.688 --> 42:52.999
quarrelling in My presence. You give Me headaches,

42:53.080 --> 42:56.000
you tell Me things, which you should not tell Me.

42:56.520 --> 42:59.520
“He knocked at my door,” somebody tells Me.

42:59.633 --> 43:02.239
He says “he came there, he did this,” another tells Me.

43:02.320 --> 43:07.320
You should not talk like this to Me.

43:10.160 --> 43:14.360
You are materially again bound by talking.

43:14.600 --> 43:18.080
From where does the talk come from? Vishuddhi.

43:18.960 --> 43:22.120
Talk comes from Vishuddhi, but it starts from, the whole vani,

43:22.360 --> 43:30.920
the whole sound starts from much below. So, to raise it higher

43:31.080 --> 43:36.480
there are stages of this sound coming in.

43:36.840 --> 43:39.960
And when it becomes madhyama, is in the heart,

43:40.040 --> 43:42.840
in the heart region where it just throbs,

43:42.999 --> 43:47.960
you do not feel the throbbing. Then it comes here.

43:48.520 --> 43:52.120
Here it becomes vaikhari.

43:53.520 --> 44:01.120
Then it becomes pashyanti means it sees, it just sees.

44:01.800 --> 44:06.960
Then it becomes Para, where it becomes just silent

44:07.000 --> 44:11.680
in the aweness of the presence.

44:14.760 --> 44:20.999
We have to develop those things. But we do not understand

44:21.120 --> 44:25.000
that all these things are our attributes,

44:25.280 --> 44:28.000
which we have to enlighten and rise.

44:28.640 --> 44:34.560
And make every part, every petal of our being beautiful.

44:37.360 --> 44:41.720
If you start understanding these small, small things,

44:41.999 --> 44:47.960
which are very important because I am talking of very big things.

44:48.040 --> 44:53.840
But even a small thing can close your eyes completely.

44:55.000 --> 45:00.000
It’s a very big vision I have, very big vision.

45:00.800 --> 45:03.040
And that vision can be done through you people.

45:03.320 --> 45:05.600
You do not think that you are ordinary.

45:05.840 --> 45:08.600
Otherwise I would never have chosen you.

45:09.200 --> 45:11.960
But you have no recognition of yourself also,

45:12.000 --> 45:14.000
as you have no recognition of Me.

45:14.760 --> 45:19.960
You have to recognize yourselves and respect yourself.

45:23.600 --> 45:27.680
Do not respect material things, respect yourself first of all

45:27.920 --> 45:29.560
and the matter within you.

45:29.800 --> 45:34.120
If you move that way I think you’ll understand better what I am saying.

45:36.920 --> 45:42.040
The body of a human being is a temple of God.

45:42.440 --> 45:48.760
But this temple has to be enlightened and has to be auspicious.

45:49.960 --> 45:54.400
You have to clear and clean your being completely

45:54.640 --> 45:58.760
so it’s a beautiful temple for God to reside there.

45:59.999 --> 46:01.960
But we deceive ourselves, you see?

46:02.000 --> 46:05.600
When I am talking, you listen to Me

46:05.999 --> 46:09.160
and you think that “Oh, Mother talked very sweetly, beautifully,”

46:09.440 --> 46:12.480
finished. But nothing goes inside.

46:12.760 --> 46:15.920
Why? Because of lethargy.

46:16.280 --> 46:18.280
Lethargy is a thing, which is a barrier.

46:18.680 --> 46:21.640
It doesn’t allow Me to go inside you.

46:22.000 --> 46:23.040
It’s a barrier.

46:23.208 --> 46:25.960
It’s very sweet thing, which smiles, just you see thinking,

46:26.000 --> 46:29.680
“Oh, Mother is saying something nice, it’s very great,”

46:29.923 --> 46:31.719
it gives you happiness and all that,

46:31.800 --> 46:36.080
but it doesn’t go inside, you do not imbibe.

46:36.520 --> 46:39.120
And that’s why, try to put your attention to yourself

46:39.360 --> 46:41.400
and feel your dignity and honor.

46:41.960 --> 46:46.440
Feel your presence that you have to have a presence

46:46.840 --> 46:49.608
and when I tell to some people, they’ll say, “I know,

46:49.689 --> 46:51.919
Mother, I know I do that.”

46:52.000 --> 46:54.960
Then why do you do it? That means you are possessed.

46:55.120 --> 46:58.120
You are a possessed person that you know this is wrong,

46:58.400 --> 47:01.800
still you are doing it. Then you are a possessed person.

47:01.999 --> 47:04.000
Then is better you beat yourself with shoes.

47:04.320 --> 47:07.960
But that stage should go now, I don’t like you to beat yourself with shoes,

47:08.000 --> 47:11.000
I mean are you that, that level?

47:11.999 --> 47:16.040
But the level is such still.

47:16.960 --> 47:21.560
And your presence is the one that should give Prasannata,

47:21.999 --> 47:24.240
is the cheerfulness to others.

47:24.920 --> 47:29.400
Others should feel cheerful in your company.

47:30.480 --> 47:35.880
A presence is something, which you can understand.

47:36.999 --> 47:39.999
A presence has prudence.

47:40.280 --> 47:45.520
It understand how to behave in a particular thing.

47:47.440 --> 47:51.520
It is not imprudent like it won’t rush to a thing.

47:51.920 --> 47:54.520
It won’t jump on to a thing. If somebody is talking

47:54.920 --> 47:59.000
you just do not become absolutely dominating on that.

47:59.640 --> 48:03.000
When you talk, you do not talk in a way that is dramatic

48:03.320 --> 48:06.440
or sort of theatrical; or neither you talk in a way

48:06.680 --> 48:08.720
that is lunatic-like or something like that.

48:08.960 --> 48:11.480
Presence has its own balance in the center

48:11.720 --> 48:14.520
and that presence must be maintained.

48:14.920 --> 48:17.999
Presence is very important and just see yourself:

48:18.160 --> 48:22.800
are you having a presence?

48:23.000 --> 48:26.200
Some people are very good Sahaj Yogis, but they have no “go,”

48:26.440 --> 48:31.200
they have no dash, at all. They receive things, they see things,

48:31.999 --> 48:37.880
they should have a dash. They have to tell people,

48:38.400 --> 48:42.560
but in a way that is congenial, that is sweet, that is beautiful,

48:42.800 --> 48:48.720
that works is the point. If it does not work, what’s the use?

48:49.160 --> 48:52.160
Now again I am going for seventeen days.

48:52.440 --> 48:54.760
Really seventeen days I’ll be out.

48:54.999 --> 49:01.000
I miss you all very much and I feel concerned so much,

49:01.840 --> 49:05.880
because you have to still grow quite a lot.

49:06.999 --> 49:14.999
I feel that among you there is no understanding of collectivity.

49:16.720 --> 49:20.960
A very irritable people; you get irritable with each other,

49:21.000 --> 49:27.280
how can you? You are all saints. You must respect each other;

49:27.640 --> 49:29.000
you must love each other,

49:29.280 --> 49:33.800
talk sweetly to each other. You are all saints!

49:34.120 --> 49:38.200
A saint meets another saint, how does he meet?

49:38.440 --> 49:43.800
Have you seen anytime, a real saint meeting another real saint?

49:45.560 --> 49:52.400
You should see. You do not look like that. The first proof is this.

49:52.640 --> 49:57.999
Are you really saints or not. He has gone to India, how they met you?

49:59.362 --> 50:02.560
Yogi: Take really hold of me. Shri Mataji: See? Yogi: I couldn’t believe him …

50:02.672 --> 50:04.439
Shri Mataji: How they meet each other!

50:04.520 --> 50:07.360
They’ll hug each other and they enjoy each other’s company.

50:07.600 --> 50:13.040
They laugh at jokes and understand it is such a congenial thing.

50:13.440 --> 50:15.960
Nobody thinks,  “I am right.” Nobody thinks like that.

50:16.000 --> 50:18.815
Once you start thinking, “I am right and that person is wrong.”

50:18.896 --> 50:22.440
“I am doing all right, he’s wrong,” finished.

50:22.880 --> 50:26.080
They enjoy themselves so much just like one wave it moves, you see?

50:26.680 --> 50:31.999
They are all the time laughing, enjoying you know, loudly.

50:32.480 --> 50:37.960
They help each other such a lot. It’s absolutely worth seeing that.

50:38.120 --> 50:42.240
While we had only five or six people to begin with,

50:42.480 --> 50:48.320
in Nilambar, from London. One better than the other.

50:48.999 --> 50:53.000
They are all fighting, quarrelling and they used to come up to beating.

50:53.240 --> 50:57.640
Can you believe it? This was happening.

50:57.999 --> 51:01.960
So shameful I tell you and everybody was coming and telling,

51:02.000 --> 51:08.960
“What sort of Sahaj Yogis you have got, Mother? Are they Sahaj Yogis, really?”

51:09.480 --> 51:11.560
Arguing and doing this and doing that.

51:11.800 --> 51:16.160
All sorts of things were on and they would not inform Me the whole of it,

51:16.400 --> 51:25.160
but part of it would come to Me. I was so ashamed. Ask Malcolm.

51:26.200 --> 51:31.280
They used to, I mean they would break each other’s heads there.

51:31.520 --> 51:36.280
This was the condition. Can you believe it?

51:37.999 --> 51:42.720
While you would never find any Sahaj Yogis doing that, never, in India.

51:42.999 --> 51:46.760
I have not seen anyone. Anybody who tries to be funny goes out,

51:47.000 --> 51:48.999
immediately out of circulation.

51:49.120 --> 51:52.880
There’s no group-forming, nobody fights with anybody, nothing.

51:52.999 --> 51:56.480
And everybody was surprised how strange these people were,

51:56.720 --> 52:05.000
one better than the other. They were very irritable, hot-tempered, fighting and all that.

52:05.280 --> 52:10.040
They were so surprised that how can there be.

52:11.280 --> 52:13.760
Give you an example here of Chhaya, see.

52:13.999 --> 52:16.760
Despite, she’s quite shocked;

52:17.160 --> 52:20.800
but she doesn’t know how to really beat things, meet.

52:20.999 --> 52:23.480
People are so criticizing, so this thing,

52:23.720 --> 52:30.480
but she’s trying to keep the balance. She’ll be always at the back.

52:31.000 --> 52:34.960
She’s never in the forward, when it comes to work she’ll be the first to do it.

52:35.000 --> 52:44.960
She takes up responsibilities. This is what happened last time.

52:45.560 --> 52:47.200
It’s not only lethargy,

52:47.440 --> 52:51.080
it is worse than that. In lethargy, you see it is a devil’s mind,

52:51.320 --> 52:55.040
and when you come out of lethargy you just come to blows.

52:55.560 --> 52:59.680
But as it is in India, I’ve not seen people coming to blows, I really tell you.

52:59.920 --> 53:02.680
Very seldom you’ll find people coming to blows.

53:03.000 --> 53:08.960
I mean, people never even talk loudly or in a temper, never.

53:09.200 --> 53:14.560
Now normally people are very quiet type. Then Sahaj Yogis,

53:14.800 --> 53:17.000
Oh! You should see how they enjoy.

53:17.240 --> 53:20.999
Oh! The girls and boys and every one, the way they enjoy.

53:21.040 --> 53:26.999
Love seeing them. You must try to enjoy each other.

53:27.360 --> 53:31.960
Now the worst thing that can happen to human beings is ego.

53:32.240 --> 53:35.960
Worst thing, possession is better, at least you feel the pinch of it.

53:36.000 --> 53:39.440
But ego you never feel the pinch.

53:39.999 --> 53:44.160
It is you never feel that there is ego in you

53:44.840 --> 53:46.960
and you think you are the most correct person,

53:47.000 --> 53:49.839
you are the best person and the temper shows here in the nose.

53:49.920 --> 53:55.560
I can see the “haw-haw,” nose coming up like that.

53:56.000 --> 54:00.720
Such ego, such ego,

54:01.440 --> 54:04.760
and this ego Indians have also picked up from you.

54:04.841 --> 54:07.164
Those who have come in contact with you, you see,

54:07.245 --> 54:09.999
as the dog when he comes in contact with human being

54:10.200 --> 54:11.320
learns many things,

54:11.560 --> 54:14.480
in the same way Indians who have come in contact

54:14.720 --> 54:18.040
with you people have picked up ego

54:20.160 --> 54:21.999
and we can see the difference.

54:22.080 --> 54:26.999
But in simple villages people try to be nice, congenial, good.

54:28.360 --> 54:31.800
How – by understanding auspiciousness.

54:32.160 --> 54:34.999
An auspicious presence is soothing,

54:35.240 --> 54:41.040
comforting, absorbing, beautiful.

54:43.800 --> 54:47.440
And this, how do you develop?

54:47.960 --> 54:51.240
You should do little aarti to My photograph is a good idea.

54:51.480 --> 54:53.600
Now when you do the aarti also,

54:53.721 --> 54:55.840
somebody is shouting at the top of his voice.

54:55.921 --> 54:59.120
He’s trying to lead others. Then another trying to lead others,

54:59.201 --> 55:01.661
this should not be. There should be some, homogeneous,

55:01.742 --> 55:04.800
I can make it out, there’s no rhythm.

55:04.999 --> 55:10.040
Sing in the same tone, same style,

55:10.280 --> 55:15.040
try to make it one, one, concord should be there.

55:16.000 --> 55:19.000
In a humble way, in joyous way that we all are singing,

55:19.240 --> 55:20.960
all our hearts are singing.

55:21.080 --> 55:22.999
All of us are here to do it.

55:23.200 --> 55:27.400
So many of us are… feel that joy, we are so many.

55:28.400 --> 55:33.240
And it has a very bad effect on others when they see you this way.

55:33.480 --> 55:36.240
I mean anybody would be shocked.

55:37.000 --> 55:42.999
Why in India it is spreading, because they see that love

55:43.240 --> 55:46.680
between the people.

55:47.999 --> 55:51.760
Now of our attention if you take it to the Spirit

55:52.360 --> 55:54.280
you’ll feel the collectivity.

55:54.640 --> 55:57.120
Attention should be, as I told you yesterday,

55:57.360 --> 56:01.040
find out how many times you have talked nicely to others

56:01.280 --> 56:03.560
and how many times have you have been quarrelling.

56:03.800 --> 56:06.560
If somebody says even a harsh word just keep quiet.

56:07.000 --> 56:11.680
Do not feel bad, it’s all right, it comes and goes.

56:11.920 --> 56:14.680
Now some people are negative

56:14.920 --> 56:17.800
in the sense that they are on the left hand side

56:17.999 --> 56:21.840
and some people are negative because they are on the right hand side.

56:21.999 --> 56:24.640
Sometimes these combinations work very well.

56:24.880 --> 56:28.760
When a dominating man tries to dominate a left handed person,

56:28.999 --> 56:31.120
they are great friends, nothing like it.

56:31.360 --> 56:34.080
Because one dominates and another takes the domination.

56:34.360 --> 56:38.400
As soon as the left hand side person becomes little on the center

56:38.640 --> 56:42.400
or tries to come to the right, the dominating ones starts clashing.

56:42.640 --> 56:46.960
Then they are the worst enemies of each other.

56:47.440 --> 56:49.999
It happens like that, so be on the alert.

56:50.160 --> 56:56.440
Now a person who is on the negative on the left side,

56:56.593 --> 56:58.079
should try to come in the center

56:58.160 --> 57:02.120
and in the same way a person who is on the

57:02.360 --> 57:04.880
right side should come to the center.

57:04.999 --> 57:11.040
Now how do you do it? Which is the way we can do it? Let us see it.

57:11.280 --> 57:13.999
A person who is very much on the right hand side

57:14.160 --> 57:20.999
should try to become friendly with the left hand side

57:21.600 --> 57:23.320
and left hand side person

57:23.640 --> 57:26.960
should try to be friendly with the right hand side, supposing.

57:27.000 --> 57:32.520
Let us start like this. So what is the give and take in this thing?

57:32.760 --> 57:37.560
The person who is on the right hand side will be better organizer,

57:37.800 --> 57:40.960
may be, may not be.

57:41.000 --> 57:47.520
At least will be a better orator or maybe a better sort of a leader,

57:47.760 --> 57:50.520
may be, may not be, you can’t say.

57:50.999 --> 57:53.920
He may be the one who will

57:54.160 --> 57:56.960
suggest things and who will bring out things,

57:57.000 --> 57:59.960
who will say “I’ll do this; I’ll do–” sort of thing, maybe.

58:00.000 --> 58:02.999
The left hand person will be frightened

58:03.040 --> 58:07.920
but will be humble, more loving, more affectionate.

58:09.200 --> 58:12.999
He’ll be much more at the command of others.

58:13.160 --> 58:14.600
This one will be commanding

58:14.840 --> 58:16.960
and the other will be receiving the command.

58:17.000 --> 58:18.760
This will be there. Now how do we

58:18.999 --> 58:22.400
solve the problem of this mixture, you see?

58:22.760 --> 58:27.200
The one who is very much on the ego side

58:27.560 --> 58:31.999
should try to obey the person who is on the left hand side.

58:35.160 --> 58:37.999
And on the left hand side should try to command

58:38.080 --> 58:41.960
more on the right hand side person and should be accepted.

58:42.000 --> 58:45.188
They, it should be mutually understood,
there should be a contract. “All right,

58:45.269 --> 58:48.999
I am an ego oriented person and you are superego oriented,

58:49.080 --> 58:50.319
now let us do one thing.

58:50.400 --> 58:53.960
You try to dominate me and I’ll try to obey you.”

58:54.000 --> 58:56.480
It will work out. It’s a psychological style.

58:56.720 --> 58:57.999
You just work it out.

58:58.200 --> 59:02.999
Try somebody who is a left sided person to dominate you.

59:03.240 --> 59:05.720
But rather difficult to get left sided people here.

59:05.960 --> 59:09.160
They are very few, because I believe some people were left sided,

59:09.400 --> 59:13.160
but when it comes to ego they are worst than anybody else, you see?

59:13.400 --> 59:19.080
So rather difficult, but you can have a person who is left sided

59:19.320 --> 59:24.999
and let than ego oriented ask him to dominate.

59:25.200 --> 59:28.999
Till he develops his ego, he’s all right. If he develops ego stop it.

59:29.520 --> 59:33.760
But with complete understanding, watching yourself, how you develop,

59:33.999 --> 59:37.960
how far you go – a play should go on. Play with yourself.

59:38.000 --> 59:40.200
But if you are identified with yourself that

59:40.281 --> 59:42.217
“I am always right, and nobody is right,”

59:42.320 --> 59:44.470
nothing can work out. I can tell you this much.

59:44.551 --> 59:50.200
Because if you are perfect I need not waste My words here.

59:50.520 --> 59:53.999
So the best way is to do this sort of a thing,

59:54.040 --> 59:57.520
“All right you order and I’ll do.

59:57.800 --> 59:59.760
Come along let’s see what do you think?

59:59.999 --> 01:00:05.040
Let you organize and we’ll do it. You tell us how to do it.”

01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:06.999
So he will use your heart

01:00:07.200 --> 01:00:10.000
and you will use your attention, it will work out very well.

01:00:10.240 --> 01:00:12.000
The combination will be good.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:16.920
Let us decide to improve ourselves and not to feel bad about it.

01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.999
We have to improve a lot and a lot and a lot,

01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:24.480
because the relationship between you seems to be so bad.

01:00:24.720 --> 01:00:32.680
It’s like cancer – absolutely cancer. It is malignant.

01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:38.520
So try to see your ego

01:00:38.625 --> 01:00:40.960
and if it’s a…now even people if you have told them

01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:42.577
that somebody says you should say

01:00:42.658 --> 01:00:44.519
“I’m sorry,” they’ll not say like that.

01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:48.040
They’ll say sarca… “Aha, I am sorry,” or something like that.

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:52.360
They’ll say in a sarcastic way so that sorry also has no meaning.

01:00:52.640 --> 01:00:57.640
All right, all right don’t say anything. This is not the way.

01:00:57.880 --> 01:01:02.960
You should say, “See yourself. So this ego has come.

01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.760
Now please tell me something else, I’ll do it.”

01:01:07.999 --> 01:01:14.760
Christ washed the feet of His disciples. Just think of that.

01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:18.760
And that’s what a sensible Sahaj Yogi does.

01:01:18.999 --> 01:01:21.200
He washes the feet of another disciple.

01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:24.999
If you remember Aradhna, my granddaughter,

01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.000
when you people came to My house.

01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:30.520
There were I think about eight or ten of them.

01:01:30.760 --> 01:01:35.520
She got a small bucket; she washed each and everybody’s feet.

01:01:35.832 --> 01:01:38.790
Every time she would take it back to the bathroom throw it away,

01:01:38.871 --> 01:01:43.520
again fill it up bring it with great Spirit. She was five years.

01:01:43.840 --> 01:01:45.840
She had not completed her five years

01:01:45.999 --> 01:01:47.960
and she would wash everybody’s feet,

01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:49.960
wipe them, again put back.

01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.960
She did for everybody and then after that she came on My feet

01:01:55.000 --> 01:01:57.236
and then she said “I’m not going to look at anybody,

01:01:57.317 --> 01:02:02.600
I’m going to run away now I have done my job,” and she went away.

01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.640
Aradhna is of a very high quality Sahaj Yogini she is,

01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:06.999
very high quality.

01:02:07.240 --> 01:02:11.000
But she thought that this is the best way of washing their feet

01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:13.960
is showing the essence of collectivity.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:19.960
“Some part of me is not all right, let me clear it.”

01:02:21.999 --> 01:02:24.440
For example if you think of Me

01:02:24.680 --> 01:02:29.600
and you, you will understand how much I work hard on you.

01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.960
Why? Because I love you very much and you are My part and parcel.

01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:38.240
If you are not all right I’m not going to be all right.

01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:43.240
If you consider then, you will never think somebody is lower than you.

01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.800
Is better to wash the feet of someone than to wash your own feet,

01:02:47.999 --> 01:02:51.960
will be a good idea. Put down your ego every time.

01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:57.480
Mohammad Sahib used this method. But best was used by Nanaka:

01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:01.480
He said, “Let all the Sikhs do some seva.”

01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:05.000
They have to, as a punishment they have to do some seva.

01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:09.999
So, what is a seva when there is a group? Somebody has to sit down.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:13.999
Even one guru, very big guru, had to clean the shoes

01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:17.880
of all the people who came for the program.

01:03:17.999 --> 01:03:20.040
He was given polish, brush and everything –

01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:22.440
very recently he was punished

01:03:22.680 --> 01:03:25.520
to clean the shoes of the people who came round.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:27.640
He was supposed to wash their clothes,

01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:30.760
wash their things, as a punishment.

01:03:30.999 --> 01:03:32.840
Anybody who is arrogant should do it.

01:03:32.999 --> 01:03:35.600
Anybody who quarrels or fights should do it.

01:03:35.840 --> 01:03:42.160
Anybody who is blunt should do it. And it worked, it works.

01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.360
They are supposed to wash their clothes,

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.640
they are supposed to wash their feet,

01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:52.960
rub their feet, give them a massage and feel better.

01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.280
In India if you see,

01:03:54.520 --> 01:03:57.480
all the Sahaj Yogis are working on each other’s chakras.

01:03:57.720 --> 01:04:01.000
But here nobody will accept even that you have these chakras caught up.

01:04:01.240 --> 01:04:05.920
Have you seen that? Everyday they are working, cleaning everybody’s,

01:04:06.001 --> 01:04:08.347
they’ll say, “Baba, clean my chakra,” they’ll say.

01:04:08.428 --> 01:04:11.760
Then when they do it they say “Thank you, you’ve cleaned mine.”

01:04:11.999 --> 01:04:14.480
And then they helped them, they rub their hands, feet

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.999
because you have done so much work for them. This is not done here.

01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:24.960
I would like to see more mutual understanding, mutual love,

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:32.600
mutual attraction for each other, should look forward to each other.

01:04:32.840 --> 01:04:35.560
Try to help each other than to criticize.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:40.080
I hate to hear any criticism of anyone from any one of you.

01:04:40.320 --> 01:04:45.080
But when it gets, goes too much is better to tell Me.

01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:48.680
But you must judge yourself, “What are we doing for others?”

01:04:48.761 --> 01:04:51.679
Some people think, “As long as we keep quiet it’s all right.”

01:04:51.760 --> 01:04:53.360
It’s not the point.

01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.320
Try to be nice, give some presents, talk to them

01:04:57.640 --> 01:05:02.360
and there are so many ways of expression of your love to them.

01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:07.960
Give sometimes flowers, try to find out what are the likes them.

01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.520
and dislikes of the person is, is very good idea.

01:05:10.760 --> 01:05:13.520
Do not do things that people do not like, sometimes you see.

01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:16.360
It’s better not to do it. What is the use?

01:05:16.600 --> 01:05:19.480
If the relationships are spoilt, not to do those things.

01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.320
Just find out what you don’t like.

01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:27.560
A simple thing: my husband doesn’t like Me to put flowers in the hair.

01:05:27.840 --> 01:05:30.720
But in Maharashtra all the married women

01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:33.800
are supposed to put the flowers in the hair,

01:05:33.999 --> 01:05:37.960
that’s a custom. But because of I’ve married him, he doesn’t like

01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:41.520
because in their community, only bad women put flowers in the head;

01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:43.720
I have never put flowers in My head.

01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:48.040
Only when it is a special puja or they tie up –

01:05:48.320 --> 01:05:50.520
in Maharashtra, there I agree.

01:05:50.760 --> 01:05:53.800
But I never make a bun and put a thing. It’s all right,

01:05:53.999 --> 01:05:55.480
if he doesn’t like it why do it?

01:05:55.720 --> 01:06:01.440
Unnecessary to increase all the clashes and the problem.

01:06:01.680 --> 01:06:04.840
Don’t do anything that people do not like you to do.

01:06:04.999 --> 01:06:08.720
Try to avoid, it creates problems.

01:06:08.817 --> 01:06:10.719
Try to do something that pleases others.

01:06:10.800 --> 01:06:14.240
Let us see if you have devised this method how to please.

01:06:14.480 --> 01:06:16.999
If you please others, your deities will be very happy,

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:18.999
because they are all one,

01:06:19.040 --> 01:06:23.520
within you, within her, within her, they are all one.

01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:26.960
And they feel happy, because they’re all related to each other,

01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.560
and they feel unhappy when you try to be unkind to each other,

01:06:30.800 --> 01:06:34.200
because they are one.

01:06:34.999 --> 01:06:38.680
If this is worked out, properly, understandingly,

01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:40.960
all of you are going to be great saints.

01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.800
I see your image in future also.

01:06:43.999 --> 01:06:46.880
Of some of you are going to be very, very great

01:06:46.999 --> 01:06:48.999
and some of you are going to take it up.

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:52.400
It’s a, it’s a project launched.

01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:54.560
Launch a project against yourself,

01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:57.600
towards yourself, building up yourself.

01:06:57.880 --> 01:07:01.160
How sweet you are going to be others, let’s have it.

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:03.760
Talk to others. Some people just don’t talk,

01:07:03.848 --> 01:07:05.999
I have seen they are all the time …[SILENCE];

01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:08.280
they will have very bad Vishuddhi.

01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.000
You must talk; you must be nice you must be open-hearted.

01:07:12.240 --> 01:07:14.239
This Yugoslav girl is very open–hearted,

01:07:14.320 --> 01:07:17.600
I like her for that reason. She has a big heart.

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:19.880
Talk with a big heart, open!

01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:26.960
No secretiveness and this cold, what is it called, English manner?

01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.960
Yogini: Aloof? Shri Mataji: Aloof?

01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.560
Yogini: When you keep yourself above people.

01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.240
Shri Mataji laughs: Aloof.

01:07:38.560 --> 01:07:41.999
I think there must be some English special word for this thing.

01:07:42.080 --> 01:07:46.198
The way they are cold you know. When you sit….Other yogini: Stiff upper lip, Mother.

01:07:46.279 --> 01:07:50.160
Shri Mataji: Ha? Several yogis: Stiff upper lip … Upper lip.

01:07:50.241 --> 01:07:52.842
Shri Mataji: Upper lip? Upper lip, not so much upper lip.

01:07:52.923 --> 01:07:55.798
There need not be upper lip, could be pride.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:03.400
[Yogi’s laugh and one make an indistinct comment at which Shri Mataji laughs]

01:08:03.800 --> 01:08:07.960
Shri Mataji: That kind of a presence is here, [INDISTINCT: DOUR,]

01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:10.160
which is specialty of English also, isn’t it?

01:08:10.241 --> 01:08:13.732
You go in a train, they just don’t talk. I mean they don’t allow you to talk,

01:08:13.813 --> 01:08:17.999
they freeze you with silence.

01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:20.440
They can’t see people laugh, smile or joke,

01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:24.360
anything a …[SILENCE] and you don’t know what to do with them.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.999
Newspaper they will read only all the way,

01:08:27.160 --> 01:08:30.720
and they will fold it and read it.

01:08:30.801 --> 01:08:33.505
But they know each and everything about you.

01:08:33.586 --> 01:08:36.960
Yogini: Could it be called “insular.”

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:41.960
Shri Mataji: Insular. Ah yes! And is a very dangerous thing for Sahaj Yogis.

01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:47.040
The one who becomes insular is in for trouble.

01:08:47.440 --> 01:08:50.200
Is in for trouble, insular.

01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:54.200
You know why, because you are left alone, you’ll be attacked.

01:08:54.680 --> 01:08:59.480
Be together. All these bhoots also know you are insular.

01:08:59.720 --> 01:09:02.640
They’ll attack you.

01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:06.560
By any chance you try to become unique, they’ll attack you.

01:09:06.800 --> 01:09:07.999
Even some people become,

01:09:08.120 --> 01:09:11.680
by talking too much also they can become insular, unique;

01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:18.240
you sit on top of everybody else. Better be with everyone, is better.

01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:21.560
Be one with everybody, congenial.

01:09:21.800 --> 01:09:22.999
Take a joke from others.

01:09:23.200 --> 01:09:25.760
Other are joking with you, you should not get angry.

01:09:25.841 --> 01:09:27.918
If somebody joking with you, “Oh! Shut up.”

01:09:27.999 --> 01:09:32.440
Like that one should not do. Take a joke, be a sport.

01:09:32.680 --> 01:09:34.999
English language has one very good quality

01:09:35.200 --> 01:09:38.320
that they can laugh at themselves, you see. All the

01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.960
language has found out ways and methods of how to laugh at yourself,

01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.320
that’s something beautiful about English language.

01:09:46.560 --> 01:09:49.360
I don’t think any language has so many words

01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:52.999
to express these odd situations,

01:09:53.080 --> 01:09:57.280
which are very, very embarrassing you see.

01:09:57.840 --> 01:10:02.320
You can only brand them and by branding them, you know where you are.

01:10:02.560 --> 01:10:05.080
You exactly know what medicine is needed for this.

01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.560
You see it is like that.

01:10:06.800 --> 01:10:08.960
It’s just branding, “Oh this is it,”

01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:11.999
and it’s very interesting to watch these things

01:10:12.080 --> 01:10:13.719
in the society and everywhere.

01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:16.280
Which is described, even Charles Dickens, now example,

01:10:16.361 --> 01:10:18.319
at that time he found out these things

01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:22.160
and he said it. And I mean the description of all these things is

01:10:22.520 --> 01:10:27.160
so beautifully done in the literature that you are amazed how people

01:10:27.400 --> 01:10:29.040
had a capacity to see themselves,

01:10:29.280 --> 01:10:33.600
the society as it is and to de… Characterization of people:

01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:35.720
how characters are built up you see

01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.720
and how it becomes a social problem.

01:10:37.960 --> 01:10:39.440
It’s beautifully done

01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:44.840
and that’s the wisdom. That’s the real wisdom of British, I tell you

01:10:44.999 --> 01:10:46.280
I mean you may lose it

01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:49.200
if you start getting dominated by nonsensical ideas,

01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:51.520
but otherwise that wisdom you have innate.

01:10:51.760 --> 01:10:54.680
I mean to have a person like Shakespeare itself shows what?

01:10:54.999 --> 01:10:58.480
I mean you are a country of great people. How can that be?

01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:03.080
Where some, they are not  “some,” there are quite a lot of them

01:11:03.320 --> 01:11:05.320
and you are going to be the wisest

01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.320
because you have the advantage of their creation.

01:11:08.999 --> 01:11:12.640
On top of, you have got advantage of your creation.

01:11:12.880 --> 01:11:15.199
Then/that? you belong to a great country like that.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:19.960
Imagine the whole country is getting into the mire of lethargy,

01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.563
who is going to save this country?

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:28.320
You people. So again and again it is against lethargy

01:11:28.999 --> 01:11:33.999
and whatever is lethargy is anti Christ,

01:11:34.200 --> 01:11:38.999
is anti God, is anti Mataji.

01:11:40.999 --> 01:11:45.320
Try to become cheerful and blissful,

01:11:45.560 --> 01:11:51.120
happy, dignified, sensible, sweet.

01:11:52.480 --> 01:11:57.400
It’s not too many things, is very few, it’s only one.

01:11:57.640 --> 01:12:01.760
And I know we are going to enjoy life very much.

01:12:01.999 --> 01:12:04.480
You are going to be very happy people.

01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:08.960
Take out your tempers from your heads first of all, the angers you see

01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:13.280
and to say, “I got very angry.” Means what? Why did you get angry?

01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.240
To be proud of your anger and temper and your irritations!

01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.240
It will be very beautiful I am sure. You are growing up,

01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:23.999
but the growth becomes little

01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.600
dwarfed with these nonsensical things, you know.

01:12:27.840 --> 01:12:30.760
So you have to protect your growth from these things

01:12:30.999 --> 01:12:35.999
as we protect a small plant from say frost falling on a plant.

01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:37.280
It’s like that.

01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:40.960
Frost is nothing compared to the plant, because plant is growing,

01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:44.840
but the frost can kill it and that’s how you do not make it a frost.

01:12:44.999 --> 01:12:45.960
Be cheerful.

01:12:46.120 --> 01:12:48.960
People come up and they go down. I’ve seen people come up

01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:51.960
and then they go down. Try to look after yourself.

01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.960
Now after seventeen days I am going to come and see you

01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:58.080
very beautifully developed and all the time My attention is on you,

01:12:58.320 --> 01:13:00.160
I work on you all the time.

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:07.520
And I’m much more intimate with you than with anybody else,

01:13:07.760 --> 01:13:09.999
because these people see Me only for two days

01:13:10.200 --> 01:13:13.280
and then they started crying!

01:13:13.600 --> 01:13:19.999
They’re lost. But I see you so much, more than even Indians.

01:13:21.120 --> 01:13:24.760
Is Paul there? Paul has come?

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.960
Yogi: Yes Mother.

01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.520
Shri Mataji: Yes. Hm. Paul, what happened?

01:13:32.672 --> 01:13:36.999
Paul: I want to get a message to, from the people of India… Shri Mataji: Ha?

01:13:37.080 --> 01:13:39.855
Paul: …Apart from the – the people of India send their love.

01:13:39.936 --> 01:13:43.560
But one of the Sahaj Yogis in india has become very ill.

01:13:43.641 --> 01:13:46.291
Shri Mataji: Who? Paul: Professor [INDISTINCT: Manneh] in Rahur.

01:13:46.372 --> 01:13:50.320
Shri Mataji: I know. But why did you get angry with Dhumal?

01:13:50.600 --> 01:13:55.240
Paul: Dhumal? By that time I’d really, I’d

01:13:55.680 --> 01:13:57.920
had enough of seeing in India the way that

01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.800
there’s two classes of people in India:

01:13:59.999 --> 01:14:02.240
those who have a lot of money and those who–

01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:04.999
Shri Mataji: And what about in this country?

01:14:05.080 --> 01:14:07.199
Paul: Well it’s the same deal in this country,

01:14:07.280 --> 01:14:09.960
but the people in this country who don’t have a lot of money,

01:14:10.041 --> 01:14:11.880
at least they have bare necessities of life.

01:14:11.961 --> 01:14:13.421
You know like a roof over their heads.

01:14:13.502 --> 01:14:17.622
Shri Mataji: You went there to do Sahaj Yoga or to do these things?

01:14:17.800 --> 01:14:20.280
You see, what I’m saying, where was your attention?

01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:25.999
Now you knows, Dhumal has given realizations to ten thousand people.

01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:30.960
And he’s your elder brother, you should respect him.

01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.960
He has a servant, because in India the situation is different.

01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.999
If he gives up his servant, he’ll have no food to eat.

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:40.999
It’s not that everybody use brain.

01:14:41.160 --> 01:14:44.245
You see this is one thing in this country people do not realize.

01:14:44.326 --> 01:14:48.240
If you use, you work much harder than his servant, do you know that?

01:14:48.480 --> 01:14:51.440
Because your brain never stops.

01:14:51.760 --> 01:14:55.160
His servants works with his hand he doesn’t think!

01:14:55.480 --> 01:14:58.960
His energy goes to his hands, he rests also.

01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:02.120
You see here the idea is if somebody’s working with the hand,

01:15:02.360 --> 01:15:03.000
it’s cruelty.

01:15:03.240 --> 01:15:05.800
But what about this brain?

01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:09.120
The amount of brain you use all the time – now tell me,

01:15:09.360 --> 01:15:11.840
you cannot stop your thinking, all right?

01:15:11.999 --> 01:15:13.800
Now see My servant,

01:15:13.999 --> 01:15:17.999
though he works hard, he’s much more relaxed than My husband is.

01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:23.880
My husband doesn’t do even lifting a, say lifting a glass.

01:15:23.999 --> 01:15:25.240
All right?

01:15:25.480 --> 01:15:29.000
And what happens, that one can say that this man is a lazy fellow,

01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:30.800
he’s enjoying everything in life,

01:15:30.999 --> 01:15:33.999
he’s enjoying all the comfort while the servant is not.

01:15:34.200 --> 01:15:37.320
But My servant is, in a way, is doing his handwork,

01:15:37.560 --> 01:15:40.520
because that’s all he can do; his brain is not that developed.

01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:43.999
And he has much more rest than My husband has.

01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:46.760
He’s much more relaxed.

01:15:47.120 --> 01:15:51.440
Somebody is the hand, somebody is the feet and somebody’s the head.

01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.480
But if you do work with your head, is the same.

01:15:54.561 --> 01:15:56.519
Now if you are doing work with your head,

01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:00.000
you have to have certain amount of comfort to your body,

01:16:00.240 --> 01:16:02.960
otherwise even if you have to suffer on your body –

01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.520
of course I do not say that servants

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:07.440
should be ill-treated by any chance,

01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:11.200
that should not be done – but…

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:14.120
And nobody gives your money to anybody else like that.

01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:15.520
You see he’s paid for it

01:16:15.760 --> 01:16:18.280
and he does the work with his hands so you can see it.

01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:24.520
But what about the brain part, do you see the brain how it works?

01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:28.400
I wish you could have a microscope to see how the brain works,

01:16:28.640 --> 01:16:31.440
and all the chakras, “cutcutcutcut-cutcutcutcut” going on.

01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:39.080
One thought itself is a dynamite

01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:41.080
and you cannot stop it, ask him.

01:16:41.320 --> 01:16:44.240
Yesterday his thought going on like a machine!

01:16:44.480 --> 01:16:46.200
There’s a machine here working out.

01:16:46.440 --> 01:16:48.960
So, this happens and then one should understand

01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.080
that when you go to any country,

01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:53.640
you are a guest there…

01:16:53.960 --> 01:16:57.400
He was very unhappy and he wrote a very sad letter to Me

01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:00.960
and that was not good. You didn’t want him to be unhappy, you w–

01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:02.960
Paul: What if I write? Shri Mataji: Ha? Dhumal?

01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:04.960
Paul: We didn’t have an argument. Shri Mataji: Ha?

01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:06.960
Paul: I didn’t have an argument. Shri Mataji: You didn’t have what?

01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:07.960
Paul: I told him what I felt. Shri Mataji: Ha?

01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.280
Paul: I told him what I felt, I just went, I just… you know the most,

01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:15.000
quite a lot of places in India. And–

01:17:15.240 --> 01:17:16.960
Shri Mataji: You, what did you feel?

01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:21.720
Paul: Well I felt that if somebody’s telling me how many houses they’ve got

01:17:21.999 --> 01:17:26.960
and how many houses they’re buying, when their servant doesn’t have a roof over his head,

01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:28.960
when the roof leaks and the children–

01:17:29.000 --> 01:17:32.960
Shri Mataji: Now, supposing, here people have so many houses which are lying empty, here,

01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:37.680
in England. Do they give their houses to you people?

01:17:37.920 --> 01:17:39.960
Do they? Is there any way?

01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:44.960
How many people you should give also, is there any system by which you should give?

01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:50.960
See that is not Dhumal’s problem, is the problem of the government.

01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.960
Dhumal has houses, he has given a huge big fort to us as a present to Sahaj Yoga.

01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:03.960
If he gives a house free to his servant, I think he will make him a parasite out of him.

01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:08.960
Do you know in India, beggars have got big, big buildings? Do you know that fact?

01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:16.960
Some of the buildings on Marine Drive are owned by people who are professionally beggars.

01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.960
So if you see some problem it has so many deeper roots, which you do not see.

01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:26.960
But, you just write a letter of apology to him. I was hurt, very much,

01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:32.960
because he, he has done such a tremendous job.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:38.960
He is going to give a huge big place to us for Sahaj Yoga.

01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:42.960
Nobody has been able to do that so far.

01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:49.960
He has given Me ten thousand people as Sahaj Yogis. And when you people say,

01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:58.960
“I felt,” what is this “I,” what is this “I”? I know you have a very sympathetic heart,

01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:05.960
but sometimes you are swayed by it. Sympathetic heart, to a point is good.

01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.960
It should be prudent heart, it should not be unwise.

01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:10.960
You must know the sense of proportion.

01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:14.960
I mean that’s a system in India, which is working, but you cannot do without servants.

01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:19.960
Here also. What is happening to you, without servants, you are all intelligent people,

01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:22.960
why you live in a mess, in pigsties?

01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.960
Because you are using your brains, you don’t know how to use your hands.

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:31.960
All these communistic ideas are of no use. People have to do some sort of a job,

01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:36.960
this job or that job. There’s nothing wrong. Some people who can do brain job,

01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:39.960
have to do brain job, those who have to do handwork has to do handwork.

01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:43.960
Of course there should not be much disparity in their living, I agree,

01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:48.960
but that’s not his problem, is the problem of the whole country.

01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:52.960
But I tell you even to servants I have seen, you give them something…

01:19:53.000 --> 01:19:55.960
There was a lady nurse, you see?

01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.960
Once I was rather sick so she used to come and see Me and help Me a little bit.

01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:03.960
So I thought just as a favor I must do something to her.

01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:09.960
So I sent her by our ship to sea, I said “Let her have a holiday, she’ll be all right.”

01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:14.960
So I sent her to Africa. I mean the problems are much deeper than you understand.

01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:19.960
I sent her to Africa. You know, she came back and she started telling the doctor off.

01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:21.960
She thought she has become the doctor.

01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.960
And the doctor told Me, “Why did you do it?” They get into imbalances. You see,

01:20:26.000 --> 01:20:32.960
even to poor persons, if you give them something like that, they go into imbalances.

01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:35.960
I’ll give you another very concrete example.

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:40.960
My husband, who is very socialistic in his approach, and is a good thing,

01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:43.960
so what he did, was to increase the pay of the drivers.

01:20:44.000 --> 01:20:47.960
You see the drivers started getting one thousand Rupee, which was very, very big amount.

01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.960
And the lowest clerk gets about say twelve hundred.

01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:53.960
So there was a very little disparity.

01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.960
Now the driver’s getting one thousand Rupees, was too much.

01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.960
Within six months their wives came to Me.

01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:03.960
They said, “This was a very wrong thing he did to our husbands.

01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:06.960
They have got keeps now; they have started drinking;

01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:10.960
they have started not giving any money to us.”

01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.960
So to poor people if you give them more money,

01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:17.960
they do not know how to use it, they will be drinking.

01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:20.960
Poor people drink much more than the rich people.

01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:28.960
So they had to be trained how to use money. You just give them money is no use.

01:21:29.000 --> 01:21:35.960
You do not understand the deeper… thing… People are to be brought up properly.

01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:39.960
Like we have got in India Schedule Caste – I agree Schedule Caste is a nonsense,

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:43.960
it should not be there, you should not treat somebody as a lower caste, is all right.

01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:46.960
But what they have brought into now, suddenly,

01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.960
that Schedule Caste must have equal seats, equal rights in every job and everything,

01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:55.960
whether they are qualified or not. So you have got people who are not qualified,

01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.960
or even in exams, in the colleges, you must have so many Schedule Caste.

01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:05.960
Now what has happened, by doing this kind of a top-heavy work,

01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:10.960
some muck has come up, and they are absolutely useless people,

01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.960
they cannot do administration. Instead of that,

01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:18.960
what Ghandiji had said, that, “Train them up, educate them, bring them up.”

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.960
Suddenly the educated people are there

01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:27.960
and some people suddenly, uneducated, nothing, brought to that, they cannot bear it.

01:22:30.000 --> 01:22:33.960
Now we had a servant with us who came to Me,

01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:36.960
who was a – you must be knowing him, Paramshivam – who came down here.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:41.960
And he used to, he was getting hardly hundred Rupees there,

01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:47.960
we gave him a big pay and everything, when he came here he started misbehaving.

01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.960
Then his mother, when I wrote to them that, “He’s misbehaving,

01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.960
I don’t know what to do. He has developed all bad habits.”

01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.960
He was buying pornography pictures here, going to the pub,

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:02.960
then having girlfriends and doing all sorts of things, he started here.

01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:06.960
So when I wrote to his mother, what his mother wrote to Me is very interesting to read.

01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:16.960
She said, “Those people who live in mud, if they have to sleep on a bed, it hurts them.

01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:24.960
So suddenly giving them something materially is not going to improve him.

01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:30.960
You have to train them up. You do not know what problems there are of poverty.

01:23:31.000 --> 01:23:40.960
Poverty is just like leprosy. Leprosy: you know what the leprosy parasites eat?

01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:47.960
They eat petrol; they thrive on petrol. So gross it is.

01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.960
And then, you being an Englishman should not have said it,

01:23:57.000 --> 01:24:03.960
because English are responsible for the poverty of India, you like it or not.

01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.960
They have created this problem for us, we didn’t have this problem before.

01:24:09.000 --> 01:24:10.960
Our servants were part and parcel of our house.

01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:15.960
They treated us just like slaves, so we have got this idea from them.

01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:22.960
How they treated us! I must say Dhumal was very decent not to say this to you,

01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:26.960
but this is what it is. The way they treated us in India, you have no idea.

01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:36.960
Even till yesterday we had “White Clubs” where Indians were not allowed on our own soil!

01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.960
When we were independent, and they’re fighting for it.

01:24:41.000 --> 01:24:45.960
They killed thousands of people, raped so many woman there.

01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:50.960
“We English” should not say that, in that country were we have ruled

01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:54.960
and made them slaves. You see they did not allow us to come up.

01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.960
What are you doing to foreigners here who are coming up?

01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:04.960
How you treat them? What racialism you have here compared to what we have in India,

01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:07.960
we have no racialism. They treated you with such great respect.

01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:11.960
They should have said, “You are white, so ‘racialism,’ all right we’ll ill-treat you.”

01:25:12.000 --> 01:25:19.960
But if you go to Africa they will teach you. Africans, West Indies – they are on top of you.

01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:24.960
What I’m saying, to break the vicious circle try to understand the problem of every country.

01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.960
From where does this problem come to India,

01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:30.960
and to most of the countries who are underdeveloped.

01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:40.960
The French, they dominated also many countries.

01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:46.960
This is also, one should understand that we should not dominate any more.

01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:51.960
We should wash their feet, that’s what it is.

01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:58.960
Now you have killed the culture of all the Africans

01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.960
and Africans have taken to all French and English culture.

01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:04.960
Absolutely, they have prostitutes the same way you have,

01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:08.960
they have the women the same way you have; their ideas of liberation’s the same,

01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.960
only the Indians have resisted you.

01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.960
Otherwise everywhere you have never respected anybody’s culture or anything.

01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:25.960
You have to face it. If you go to South America,

01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:30.960
you’ll be shocked the way people have wiped out all the… all the people who lived there;

01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:35.960
all of them, one and all. Except for Columbia, can you imagine?

01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:43.960
Every country, every soul has been wiped out. Just see that.

01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:55.960
Of course if he was ill-treating him I can understand, but he doesn’t ill-treat.

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:01.960
These ideas are Western ideas; they’re applicable to you people, not to Indians.

01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:04.960
And this is the big mistake people are doing is to put your ideas onto us.

01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:08.960
For example in field reforms, you see?

01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.960
My son-in-law is a very enlightened fellow, he had twenty-five miles,

01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:18.960
square miles of area of his own. But he used to get his labor from all these areas,

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.960
he used to provide them everything, he used to pay them very well;

01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:24.960
they were living very well. Suddenly the idea came,

01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.960
“No. They must have their own land holdings,” all right – without understanding

01:27:30.000 --> 01:27:32.960
that they are to be trained, they are to be brought up, they are not educated,

01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.960
there must be communication – so everybody was given a one patch here

01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.960
and a one patch there and a one patch there and a one patch there.

01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:44.960
What happened, that they started getting strangulated in those areas.

01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:48.960
There was no way of communication to them, they could not get their wheat,

01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:52.960
they could not get their seeds, they could not do anything, they started starving.

01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:56.960
And they came to My son-in-law that, “You come forward,

01:27:57.000 --> 01:28:00.960
you are the one who was the agency in between and you should have done it.”

01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:04.960
But they removed the agency and without training these people.

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.960
Ghandiji suggested these things. He said that,

01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:14.960
“You must enlighten the rich people and you must also try to emancipate these people

01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.960
by education, by making them understanding,” and all that.

01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:27.960
There is a huge, areas in India, which are called as “Backward Areas,”

01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.960
where these aboriginals live. They do not believe in any sedentary habits,

01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:37.960
they are like, what you call the gypsies. So what they do,

01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:43.960
these people plough their fields and all that, and they come in the night and plunder it.

01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:49.960
And they live like that. And they have been living like this and they feel very happy about it.

01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:54.960
They second is this (?), the so-called poor of India.

01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.960
You must see how leprosy grows also.

01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:00.960
They started in Maharashtra a scheme by which they said,

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.960
“We will provide you jobs and otherwise we’ll give you a dole.”

01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:10.960
Now this is the worst thing that can happen to anyone; that we have realized very soon,

01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.960
I hope they have withdrawn it. So they what they did –

01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.960
Indians as it is they are very cunning and clever –

01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:19.960
so what they did they would go and write their names as the people who are doles,

01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:23.960
getting doles, you see? And they would work somewhere and get the dole as well,

01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:32.960
double money. Then they would go and drink. What are these people doing,

01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:41.960
but to drink? It’s such a problem, prohibition; they, they drink iodine, they drink,

01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:44.960
what you call this… What do you eat, drink for this thing,

01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:47.960
it’s some sort of sulphuric acid or some sort of an acid they drink?

01:29:48.000 --> 01:29:51.960
I don’t know? Various yogis: Meths… Methylated Spirits.

01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:57.960
Shri Mataji: Methylated or whatever… [laughs] I don’t know! I don’t understand.

01:29:58.000 --> 01:29:59.960
So, you see they are so foolish,

01:30:00.000 --> 01:30:05.960
what I am saying that taking up anything like that at random is not good.

01:30:06.000 --> 01:30:07.960
And I was sorry because his wife wrote to Me,

01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.960
“How much they have done for Sahaj Yoga.”

01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:17.960
The only solution is Sahaj Yoga. There’s no other solution, which he has helped Me a lot.

01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:22.960
“You see,” and he was very sorry he said that, “How am I to do without servants?”

01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:27.960
You see the servant system is like that. If he gives roof to everyone he’ll be left with no house.

01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:31.960
There’s not done, this kind of generosity’s not done anywhere.

01:30:32.000 --> 01:30:37.960
If there was such an agency like that, which was doing such a work, it is possible.

01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:41.960
Even the so called communists everywhere, wherever they are in a democracy,

01:30:42.000 --> 01:30:50.960
have their own properties. Once the democracy will go away they won’t be able to even talk.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.960
But I do not say that Capitalism is the solution; I say Sahaj Yoga is the solution, all right?

01:30:57.000 --> 01:31:00.960
It is the Sahaj Yoga and he’s done so much for Sahaj Yoga.

01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:04.960
For that servant we cannot in any way insult him; servant is not important for us,

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:10.960
who is the servant? Who are these poor people to us?

01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:16.960
We are not responsible for them, the state is responsible.

01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:23.000
We are responsible for Sahaj Yogis, because they are the people who make the difference.
