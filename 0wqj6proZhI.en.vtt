00:00:03.174 --> 00:00:07.034
In the West, you have grown very big outside,

00:00:07.121 --> 00:00:09.494
like a tree has grown very big.

00:00:09.748 --> 00:00:14.150
But it must find its roots, otherwise the whole tree can fall off,

00:00:14.332 --> 00:00:19.084
without nutrition. So you must know the knowledge of the roots.

00:00:19.425 --> 00:00:22.739
Without the knowledge of the roots, the tree has no meaning.

00:00:24.421 --> 00:00:28.744
 So this may be a little new thing for you to understand,

00:00:28.903 --> 00:00:31.447
but you must know ... to know the knowledge of the roots

00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.328
 you have to become subtle.

00:00:33.527 --> 00:00:37.238
If you are not a subtle personality you cannot enter into your roots

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:41.508
and you cannot understand what lies in there.

00:00:41.937 --> 00:00:44.533
So, first of all, I said yesterday,

00:00:44.636 --> 00:00:48.747
you all should get your Realisation, and after your Realisation

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.159
 you can understand this better than anything else.

00:00:53.683 --> 00:00:55.424
Christ came on this earth,

00:00:55.861 --> 00:00:58.840
 but he was only allowed to preach and talk

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:01.581
 for three and a half years of his life time.

00:01:01.734 --> 00:01:03.763
And in tree and a half years is nothing.

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:07.982
In that, whatever was possible he said positively,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.392
 he told about the future,  all that was to happen.

00:01:12.177 --> 00:01:14.237
 He didn't talk much about the Holy Ghost.

00:01:14.356 --> 00:01:18.327
The reason was His Mother was the Holy Ghost at that time

00:01:18.621 --> 00:01:20.569
 and He didn't want to talk about Her

00:01:20.728 --> 00:01:23.399
because the attention of the people

00:01:23.613 --> 00:01:26.359
would be on Her and they would have killed Her.

00:01:27.422 --> 00:01:30.932
And then he has got eleven destroying powers.

00:01:31.211 --> 00:01:34.727
 And he would have used those eleven destroying powers

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.780
and everything would have been finished,

00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:39.994
 the whole drama would have been finished.

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:43.982
So He did not mention much about the Holy Ghost and did not exaplain.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.693
But logically we must understand that we talk of the Father

00:01:48.964 --> 00:01:51.944
 and of the Son but not of the Mother.

00:01:52.071 --> 00:01:55.471
How can you have a father and a son and no mother?

00:01:55.724 --> 00:01:59.911
 That's an impossibility. So, Holy Ghost is the Primordial Mother.

00:02:00.292 --> 00:02:02.321
In the sanskrit language if you go -

00:02:02.465 --> 00:02:05.562
 because in the Bible you cannot find everything about Christ,

00:02:05.747 --> 00:02:07.072
 it's very little.

00:02:07.286 --> 00:02:11.072
But you have to go back about 1400 years back that in India,

00:02:11.905 --> 00:02:15.070
people have prophesied about Him, how He will be coming.

00:02:15.284 --> 00:02:17.354
 And about the Primordial Mother

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.536
who was called as Adi Shakti  who was the Holy Ghost.

00:02:20.826 --> 00:02:24.084
All description was given  and when Her advent will come

00:02:24.211 --> 00:02:26.693
 what will happen and how to recognize her.

00:02:27.592 --> 00:02:31.319
All this is described very well so many years back,

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:34.380
even about Christ, quite a lot to described

00:02:34.538 --> 00:02:37.429
 and also we are going to read it out to you,

00:02:37.564 --> 00:02:40.429
 the translation of what is written about Christ

00:02:40.691 --> 00:02:46.214
and then there is a complete description about His origin,

00:02:46.376 --> 00:02:49.764
 how He came on this earth and what was the purpose of His life.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:52.126
Ask that gentlemen to come inside. Can you ?

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:55.897
This gentlemen, come inside. You sit comfortably.

00:02:57.751 --> 00:02:59.882
And what was the purpose of His life

00:03:00.034 --> 00:03:03.612
and how He has to establish in this centre here

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.563
and that by establishing there he can suck

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.290
the ego and superego in you and how He takes you away,

00:03:12.465 --> 00:03:16.666
 or He washes off your karmas and your conditionings.

00:03:16.833 --> 00:03:20.878
All that has been described very well in the Devi Mahatmya book

00:03:20.958 --> 00:03:23.949
 out of which we are just going to read a little bit to you

00:03:24.108 --> 00:03:25.430
about the adoration.

00:03:25.637 --> 00:03:29.094
So Bible cannot contain Christ, because Christ is Chaitanya,

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:32.605
 He is Omkara, He is the Logos as we call Him.

00:03:32.828 --> 00:03:36.983
 He is the Power, and you cannot describe Him in one little book,

00:03:37.158 --> 00:03:40.364
when He was here only for three and a half years  and

00:03:40.538 --> 00:03:43.666
the people who saw him also were his disciples,

00:03:43.793 --> 00:03:46.290
they did not know much about Him.

00:03:46.434 --> 00:03:48.783
 Until he was resurrected they did not believe Him

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:52.396
 and even after His death, I mean His resurrection,

00:03:52.539 --> 00:03:56.434
Matthew and all these people were quite disturbed and upset

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.634
 because you know they were all persecuted

00:03:58.746 --> 00:04:01.502
and they, somehow or the other, wanted to continue

00:04:01.863 --> 00:04:04.973
 the message of Christ in a very secretive manner.

00:04:06.182 --> 00:04:09.289
So today the time has come for you to know about Him,

00:04:09.488 --> 00:04:13.284
about what He was -  in the Heaven

00:04:13.498 --> 00:04:15.350
 and how He came on this Earth.

00:04:15.612 --> 00:04:19.693
 All that we don't have time today but we'll be just telling you

00:04:20.102 --> 00:04:23.207
 about a little passage that is written about him.

00:04:23.374 --> 00:04:26.354
So first, He is the one who is innocence,

00:04:26.466 --> 00:04:28.378
 who is an eternal child,

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.183
and He appears first on the first chakra of Muladhara,

00:04:33.366 --> 00:04:35.426
 and there He's called as Shri Ganesh.

00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:38.073
Where the carbon atom was made. Carbon.

00:04:38.328 --> 00:04:41.692
And that is very important to understand that Ganesha

00:04:41.933 --> 00:04:44.925
 is the symbol of innocence

00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:52.166
and Mother Earth is the power of that deity, Ganesha.

00:04:52.531 --> 00:04:57.236
So it was Ganesha, later on incarnated on this Earth  as Christ,

00:04:57.392 --> 00:05:01.770
 and He will be incarnated again as eleven Rudras,

00:05:01.984 --> 00:05:05.497
 means Ekadashas, or we can call him as Nishkalanka deity,

00:05:06.116 --> 00:05:09.152
when He will just sort out things in a sense that

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:13.498
He will just cut the people out who are not realised,

00:05:13.665 --> 00:05:17.241
 who are no good, and the rest of them

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:19.832
will ascend in the Kingdom of Heaven,

00:05:19.968 --> 00:05:21.829
 this is what is the last Ascent.

00:05:22.257 --> 00:05:24.543
Now, for this ... Please sit down, please.

00:05:24.964 --> 00:05:26.873
 Please be seated, give him a chair ...

00:05:26.992 --> 00:05:29.030
 You have to sit down comfortably. You see,

00:05:29.182 --> 00:05:32.345
It is a thing that makes... happen something within you,

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.300
so you have to be very much restful, that's very important.

00:05:35.371 --> 00:05:38.865
Give him a chair if he cannot sit on the ground.

00:05:39.033 --> 00:05:43.320
Give him a chair, but be comfortable otherwise it won't work out, you see,

00:05:43.481 --> 00:05:46.112
 it is not something that will go into your mind,

00:05:46.193 --> 00:05:48.311
 it's something that will go to your being, so

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:49.846
you have to be very receptive.

00:05:50.021 --> 00:05:52.087
Another thing I'll tell you, yesterday also

00:05:52.182 --> 00:05:56.083
I saw, and today also, you should not move your neck

00:05:56.194 --> 00:05:58.546
by eating something or chewing something

00:05:58.641 --> 00:06:01.350
because this Vishuddhi chakra gets upset at that time.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:04.064
So keep still, unless and until you are still

00:06:04.289 --> 00:06:07.531
 it cannot work out. So please keep still.

00:06:08.594 --> 00:06:10.709
So this is the nourishment of the roots

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:13.640
of which we are going to work out, which you will feel it,

00:06:13.851 --> 00:06:16.910
very nicely within yourself.
