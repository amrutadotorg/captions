00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
It is really gratifying

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
to come to Melbourne

00:00:05.679 --> 00:00:07.679
I came here

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:11.602
because somebody who had come to Sydney

00:00:12.983 --> 00:00:16.896
and said that "Mother, you must come to Melbourne.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.026
We need you."

00:00:22.047 --> 00:00:24.623
When I came here for some other purpose,

00:00:27.196 --> 00:00:31.103
I felt vibrations of Melbourne

00:00:32.522 --> 00:00:33.917
are really very good,

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:38.440
and here it is quite possible

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.790
that there maybe many seekers.

00:00:46.012 --> 00:00:48.012
It is really gratifying as I said

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:49.706
to be here among you.

00:00:52.856 --> 00:00:55.844
It's a fact that the time has come

00:00:56.216 --> 00:00:58.690
for thousands and thousands and thousands

00:00:58.976 --> 00:01:00.976
and millions of them

00:01:02.587 --> 00:01:05.103
who are born as seekers on this earth,

00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:09.425
have to get their Realisation.

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:13.699
They have to know their meaning.

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.370
They have to know why

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:21.628
why the nature has made them a human being from amoeba.

00:01:22.962 --> 00:01:24.962
What is the purpose of their life?

00:01:25.783 --> 00:01:28.595
Unless and until you find the purpose of your life

00:01:28.988 --> 00:01:30.988
you are not going to be happy.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.830
You are not going to be satisfied.

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:35.666
You may try anything else.

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:38.317
You may have one of those ego trips;

00:01:39.116 --> 00:01:43.190
you may have other trips like seeking money.

00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:49.028
You may have other things like going to drugs,

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.510
alcoholism,

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.923
livercation, all kinds of things.

00:01:55.658 --> 00:01:58.723
But these things have not given any satisfaction,

00:02:00.056 --> 00:02:00.885
to anyone.

00:02:03.693 --> 00:02:05.693
You have to find out that Absolute,

00:02:06.834 --> 00:02:09.241
without which we are in confusion.

00:02:11.835 --> 00:02:13.835
That Absolute is within you.

00:02:15.681 --> 00:02:18.081
That's why Sahaja Yoga

00:02:18.837 --> 00:02:21.491
is as spontaneous thing, is a living thing.

00:02:22.354 --> 00:02:24.657
"Saha" means with, "Ja" means born.

00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:26.577
It is born with you,

00:02:27.205 --> 00:02:28.564
as in a seed

00:02:28.914 --> 00:02:32.240
all the maps of the seed that is going to manifest

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:36.157
are built-in.

00:02:36.315 --> 00:02:38.315
In the same way within you,

00:02:40.973 --> 00:02:44.280
your Spirit and your Kundalini

00:02:44.438 --> 00:02:49.035
are all already existing there

00:02:49.578 --> 00:02:52.028
and they are just waiting for a chance

00:02:53.447 --> 00:02:55.618
to give you your Self-Realisation.

00:02:58.533 --> 00:03:04.388
Before telling you about the benefits of Self-Realisation,

00:03:06.063 --> 00:03:09.569
I have to tell you that you must keep your minds open

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.191
as you would for any science lecture or any other lecture.

00:03:17.447 --> 00:03:19.447
There's no jugglery

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.107
or there is no shopping, guru shopping in Sahaja Yoga.

00:03:26.547 --> 00:03:28.971
It is a happening, it’s an actualisation.

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.108
It is within you. It’s a living force,

00:03:33.608 --> 00:03:38.348
like a flower becomes a fruit

00:03:39.745 --> 00:03:42.720
or an egg becomes a chick,

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:47.619
you get your Realisation and you become a different personality,

00:03:47.628 --> 00:03:51.362
a new dimension of awareness grows into you

00:03:52.311 --> 00:03:55.223
and this new dimension of awareness

00:03:55.274 --> 00:03:56.695
is an actualisation,

00:03:57.024 --> 00:04:00.645
it's not just a mere words

00:04:01.145 --> 00:04:04.717
or any kind of a brainwashing.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.225
It is an actualisation within you,

00:04:10.178 --> 00:04:12.801
which happens by which

00:04:13.301 --> 00:04:15.301
you start feeling

00:04:15.801 --> 00:04:17.801
the collective consciousness.

00:04:18.835 --> 00:04:22.341
You are a part and parcel of the whole,

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.655
so many have said it.

00:04:25.202 --> 00:04:26.376
We also believe in it

00:04:26.513 --> 00:04:28.753
that we are the part and parcel of the whole,

00:04:29.338 --> 00:04:31.682
but so far in our awareness,

00:04:32.503 --> 00:04:35.269
in our central nervous system, we have not felt that.

00:04:38.184 --> 00:04:40.827
So this is actually should happen to you.

00:04:45.088 --> 00:04:48.222
In this we have to accept,

00:04:49.192 --> 00:04:54.025
whatever is nourishing for our growth, after Realisation.

00:04:55.679 --> 00:04:58.082
Gradually you started accepting it

00:04:58.582 --> 00:05:00.582
and I'll tell you why it happens

00:05:02.214 --> 00:05:04.947
but the thing is in Sydney I found

00:05:05.447 --> 00:05:08.567
that people are extremely honest about their seeking

00:05:09.067 --> 00:05:11.983
and they really appreciated my honesty.

00:05:15.667 --> 00:05:17.667
This is a process

00:05:18.017 --> 00:05:20.275
which was built in since long within us.

00:05:21.578 --> 00:05:23.871
Here that you see different chakras.

00:05:24.371 --> 00:05:25.471
Are placed.

00:05:30.625 --> 00:05:33.385
Can you see? All right.

00:05:33.701 --> 00:05:37.130
These centres are placed within

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.109
the human beings

00:05:41.886 --> 00:05:44.108
and they exist at subtle centers

00:05:45.557 --> 00:05:47.742
in the spinal cord and in the brain.

00:05:50.541 --> 00:05:53.970
These are called in Sanskrit language as chakras.

00:05:55.784 --> 00:05:58.523
These centres exist within us

00:05:59.187 --> 00:06:01.677
as milestones of our evolution.

00:06:02.615 --> 00:06:04.615
For example, the lowest chakra

00:06:05.115 --> 00:06:07.115
called as the Mooladdhara chakra,

00:06:07.615 --> 00:06:09.615
is the center,

00:06:11.447 --> 00:06:15.643
at that point we were carbon atoms. We were matter.

00:06:19.209 --> 00:06:22.424
At that point we were innocent. Matter is innocent.

00:06:24.201 --> 00:06:27.586
So the first thing that was created within us was innocence.

00:06:28.925 --> 00:06:31.515
This whole universe was created

00:06:33.037 --> 00:06:35.037
after innocence was created.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.800
This chakra is placed

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.034
below the Kundalini, if you see it clearly.

00:06:43.881 --> 00:06:47.468
Kundalini is the pure power of desire.

00:06:48.315 --> 00:06:50.315
Pure power of desire.

00:06:50.815 --> 00:06:53.017
Whatever is pure we call it Holy.

00:06:53.937 --> 00:06:57.605
Is the Holy power of desire,

00:06:58.963 --> 00:07:00.963
which remains

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.850
dormant.

00:07:09.365 --> 00:07:12.022
This power is the desire

00:07:12.668 --> 00:07:15.455
to be one with the Spirit.

00:07:17.141 --> 00:07:20.238
Without knowing the Spirit, you cannot know God.

00:07:22.125 --> 00:07:24.346
You are to be input to the mains.

00:07:25.704 --> 00:07:27.229
You are not yet put to the mains.

00:07:27.273 --> 00:07:29.437
For example, this instrument that we have made

00:07:30.247 --> 00:07:32.876
if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning.

00:07:34.288 --> 00:07:36.288
So that has to happen.

00:07:36.788 --> 00:07:38.788
It's like the primule in the seed,

00:07:38.905 --> 00:07:40.905
a germinating power

00:07:41.715 --> 00:07:42.473
in the seed,

00:07:42.864 --> 00:07:46.087
that you have got this power, residual power

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:47.899
sleeping

00:07:48.581 --> 00:07:50.581
waiting for a moment

00:07:50.844 --> 00:07:52.246
when somebody

00:07:52.746 --> 00:07:55.259
who is authorised by the Divine

00:07:55.412 --> 00:07:56.354
and not

00:07:56.653 --> 00:07:59.164
by any organization or certificates

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:01.869
that human beings give.

00:08:02.844 --> 00:08:05.618
But somebody, who himself is a Realised soul,

00:08:05.954 --> 00:08:07.954
as an enlightened person

00:08:08.454 --> 00:08:09.454
and he knows

00:08:11.304 --> 00:08:13.652
what is this power is,

00:08:16.506 --> 00:08:18.506
it waits for such a personality

00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:21.900
and then it awakens itself

00:08:22.035 --> 00:08:24.035
and you get your Self-Realisation.

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.820
It has to be spontaneous

00:08:29.919 --> 00:08:34.132
everything vital in life has to be spontaneous.

00:08:36.128 --> 00:08:39.345
The breathing that we have

00:08:40.575 --> 00:08:43.609
is so spontaneously going on

00:08:44.109 --> 00:08:48.196
that we take it for granted till it stops, or till we feel

00:08:49.718 --> 00:08:51.051
that we cannot breathe.

00:08:53.157 --> 00:08:55.157
If you have to go and read books,

00:08:55.274 --> 00:08:58.881
or putting some efforts to breathe,

00:08:59.381 --> 00:09:03.598
then how many of us could

00:09:04.098 --> 00:09:06.616
even exist for more than

00:09:07.481 --> 00:09:09.481
say five minutes?

00:09:11.404 --> 00:09:13.404
It is so vital

00:09:13.776 --> 00:09:16.256
is the culmination of our evolution

00:09:17.833 --> 00:09:22.296
and as the whole creation was created by the Divine,

00:09:23.453 --> 00:09:26.509
as you are also created by the Divine,

00:09:27.155 --> 00:09:31.428
this great happening is to be done by the Divine.

00:09:35.213 --> 00:09:37.213
Now some people asked me

00:09:37.286 --> 00:09:40.433
that can it not happen by itself to us.

00:09:41.424 --> 00:09:46.198
We do not know that at every stage of our evolution

00:09:47.104 --> 00:09:50.167
some aspect of God had to incarnate

00:09:50.795 --> 00:09:53.893
or some guidance had to come from the Divine,

00:09:55.782 --> 00:09:59.824
to give us a higher awareness.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:03.350
But specially at this time

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.080
it is very important

00:10:05.409 --> 00:10:07.409
that somebody has to do it

00:10:07.909 --> 00:10:11.130
because you have reached a stage where,

00:10:12.314 --> 00:10:15.984
you have to know it in words,

00:10:16.762 --> 00:10:19.045
and Divine had to speak.

00:10:22.301 --> 00:10:26.456
It's a very common question that in,

00:10:26.465 --> 00:10:28.465
I think people are ego orientated,

00:10:28.901 --> 00:10:31.574
they said, "Why you Mother?" I said you better be there!

00:10:32.245 --> 00:10:35.043
I’ll be very happy if you could do it

00:10:35.778 --> 00:10:39.180
because I am a happily married woman,

00:10:39.894 --> 00:10:41.894
I don't need anything from anyone,

00:10:42.394 --> 00:10:44.394
I have to just give

00:10:44.894 --> 00:10:50.447
but if you can do my work, I will be very happy to retire.

00:10:52.699 --> 00:10:55.744
It's very easy to say, "why you?" I mean you should ask

00:10:55.757 --> 00:10:58.271
God why He gave me these powers?

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.160
But they are there,

00:11:01.392 --> 00:11:05.331
but one need not feel hurt about it so much also.

00:11:05.539 --> 00:11:08.282
After all you have some many powers which I don't have.

00:11:08.782 --> 00:11:10.782
For example, I don't know how to drive,

00:11:11.282 --> 00:11:12.364
really I don't know.

00:11:12.669 --> 00:11:13.870
I don’t know many things,

00:11:13.932 --> 00:11:16.626
even I don't know how to open ordinary cans

00:11:17.248 --> 00:11:19.965
but if I know how to open the Kundalini

00:11:20.684 --> 00:11:22.684
why should it hurt your ego?

00:11:23.574 --> 00:11:25.574
And why should you feel bad

00:11:25.733 --> 00:11:28.485
because I have to really work day in day out.

00:11:30.396 --> 00:11:32.396
To do this work,

00:11:33.529 --> 00:11:35.529
it’s something just a gift to you.

00:11:35.810 --> 00:11:37.810
There is no shopping;

00:11:38.091 --> 00:11:40.091
you can't pay for it.

00:11:40.372 --> 00:11:41.831
It is beyond,

00:11:42.818 --> 00:11:44.818
your control.

00:11:45.318 --> 00:11:50.459
To conceive God, you have to see, as the reality is.

00:11:51.616 --> 00:11:53.640
You have to give up your conceptions.

00:11:53.702 --> 00:11:56.819
Supposing I had conceived a hall

00:11:57.319 --> 00:11:59.319
before seeing this,

00:11:59.478 --> 00:12:01.478
I would have had funny ideas

00:12:02.197 --> 00:12:03.642
but after seeing it

00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:06.570
only I really know what it is.

00:12:07.386 --> 00:12:08.559
In the same way

00:12:09.059 --> 00:12:10.363
people have written books,

00:12:11.033 --> 00:12:13.033
thousands of books they have written

00:12:13.533 --> 00:12:16.163
or even millions of books they have written, so what to do?

00:12:17.223 --> 00:12:18.544
If they have written the books,

00:12:18.582 --> 00:12:21.309
have they given you any Self-Realisation?

00:12:23.852 --> 00:12:26.445
Have they given you that experience

00:12:26.945 --> 00:12:29.490
of the absolute by which you know yourself,

00:12:29.990 --> 00:12:32.985
you know your centres and you know the centre of others

00:12:33.485 --> 00:12:36.217
and you start manifesting your own powers.

00:12:37.739 --> 00:12:39.911
You become the master of your powers.

00:12:42.698 --> 00:12:47.110
This is what should be the criteria of your seeking.

00:12:48.437 --> 00:12:52.825
Why should you be identified with anything else but yourself?

00:12:54.225 --> 00:12:55.633
Because I get people

00:12:55.865 --> 00:12:57.940
belonging to this cult or this group

00:12:58.002 --> 00:13:00.002
or this religion or this and that.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:05.184
But you must understand

00:13:05.684 --> 00:13:07.684
that you are not here

00:13:07.916 --> 00:13:09.916
to be pleader for any one of them.

00:13:10.684 --> 00:13:13.102
I mean you pay them to be their pleader

00:13:14.794 --> 00:13:18.411
or to be their lawyers or solicitors, whatever you may call it.

00:13:21.003 --> 00:13:24.442
But you should really try to honestly seek the truth

00:13:24.942 --> 00:13:26.653
and ask for this truth

00:13:27.028 --> 00:13:29.028
and then only you will get the truth.

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:32.720
So first thing one should understand

00:13:32.952 --> 00:13:34.952
that you cannot purchase Divine.

00:13:35.671 --> 00:13:38.058
You cannot pay for it, it is an insult,

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:40.796
it is an insult.

00:13:42.877 --> 00:13:46.048
And secondly you cannot put in effort for that.

00:13:46.889 --> 00:13:48.352
When you have to sprout a seed

00:13:48.365 --> 00:13:50.365
what do you do? You put it in the Mother Earth,

00:13:50.914 --> 00:13:53.381
and she sprouts by itself spontaneously.

00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:55.598
It has got that force in it,

00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:57.859
only you have to put it to the Mother Earth.

00:13:58.967 --> 00:14:01.410
And the Mother Earth by her warmth

00:14:01.910 --> 00:14:03.910
germinates the seed.

00:14:04.994 --> 00:14:07.240
Do you get angry with the Mother Earth for that,

00:14:07.278 --> 00:14:08.885
that, why must you do that?

00:14:11.137 --> 00:14:13.357
If she has to do it, she has to do it.

00:14:13.857 --> 00:14:16.077
Whatever the sun has to do has to do,

00:14:16.577 --> 00:14:18.577
and whatever you have to do, you can do

00:14:18.907 --> 00:14:20.907
and whatever the animals have to do, they do.

00:14:24.326 --> 00:14:25.676
If we understand that

00:14:25.714 --> 00:14:28.282
we have not yet achieved what we wanted to,

00:14:31.969 --> 00:14:33.969
then you will realise

00:14:34.761 --> 00:14:36.761
that there is a very little gap.

00:14:38.453 --> 00:14:40.453
The Kundalini awakening takes

00:14:41.342 --> 00:14:42.981
split of a second,

00:14:44.162 --> 00:14:49.467
but its rising may take more time in certain people

00:14:50.575 --> 00:14:55.131
because of blockages in the centre

00:14:55.972 --> 00:14:59.432
or maybe some imbalances within us.

00:15:01.708 --> 00:15:04.303
In short I will try to tell you

00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.286
what is the Kundalini and what is this picture about.

00:15:09.002 --> 00:15:11.002
I hope you have got some books with you,

00:15:11.161 --> 00:15:13.546
you can also open and see for yourself.

00:15:14.046 --> 00:15:17.562
Those who haven't got books can also get from them,

00:15:18.767 --> 00:15:22.181
it will be easier to understand it.

00:15:24.554 --> 00:15:28.237
At the back of the book you will find a nice chart.

00:15:40.146 --> 00:15:42.849
Firstly you have to be honest about your seeking,

00:15:44.054 --> 00:15:47.271
absolutely honest about it then everything will work out.

00:15:50.666 --> 00:15:54.064
Now here you see this chart

00:15:54.564 --> 00:15:56.564
is the first center

00:15:57.064 --> 00:15:59.209
called as the Mooladhara chakra, as I said,

00:16:00.585 --> 00:16:01.691
and the sacrum.

00:16:02.556 --> 00:16:04.847
See the meaning of the word sacrum means sacred.

00:16:06.077 --> 00:16:09.224
Sacrum is the bone in which the Kundalini is there.

00:16:11.865 --> 00:16:14.282
I would like you to see from the top

00:16:15.877 --> 00:16:19.512
this blue color balloon like structure

00:16:19.866 --> 00:16:21.866
comes down up to the first chakra.

00:16:26.672 --> 00:16:27.728
Now this,

00:16:32.899 --> 00:16:36.686
represents a subtle force within us,

00:16:38.743 --> 00:16:41.226
which is the power of desire.

00:16:43.623 --> 00:16:45.623
It manifests outside

00:16:46.123 --> 00:16:48.123
the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:16:50.496 --> 00:16:53.012
This is the emotional side of a human being.

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.841
It is not only emotional.

00:16:59.112 --> 00:17:02.323
This is the one that

00:17:02.823 --> 00:17:04.823
takes conditionings

00:17:07.293 --> 00:17:08.411
within itself

00:17:08.473 --> 00:17:11.495
when we say "Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that"

00:17:16.009 --> 00:17:19.259
and creates by its activity

00:17:20.148 --> 00:17:24.107
a balloon like structure called as superego

00:17:24.607 --> 00:17:26.607
which is in Sanskrit called as mana.

00:17:28.275 --> 00:17:33.007
So this is the power of mana, of manashakti.

00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:35.101
English language is a little

00:17:35.236 --> 00:17:37.236
confused, when you say mental cases

00:17:37.468 --> 00:17:40.014
you do not mean, the mental cases

00:17:40.149 --> 00:17:42.597
that has something to do with the

00:17:42.756 --> 00:17:44.357
mind which thinks.

00:17:44.857 --> 00:17:46.471
But when you say mental cases,

00:17:46.776 --> 00:17:50.060
you mean to say that they are the people who suffer

00:17:50.292 --> 00:17:52.292
from emotional problems.

00:17:53.741 --> 00:17:55.175
It's a little confused thing

00:17:55.894 --> 00:17:57.894
but in psychology

00:17:58.954 --> 00:18:01.274
it is very nicely described by Jung,

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.065
who was a realised soul himself,

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:05.238
the superego

00:18:06.857 --> 00:18:09.202
and the ID part is this

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:13.430
power by which we

00:18:15.414 --> 00:18:17.972
get all our conditionings within us

00:18:18.326 --> 00:18:20.326
and we pass it to our past.

00:18:20.996 --> 00:18:23.317
Beyond this area on the left-hand side

00:18:24.206 --> 00:18:26.206
lies beyond the subconscious,

00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:30.085
the collective sub-conscious, all that is dead,

00:18:31.047 --> 00:18:34.580
since creation lies this side on the left-hand side.

00:18:35.486 --> 00:18:37.786
This manifests as I told you,

00:18:38.286 --> 00:18:40.286
the left sympathetic nervous system.

00:18:40.786 --> 00:18:42.407
Now in the medical science,

00:18:42.907 --> 00:18:46.100
there is no difference between the left and right.

00:18:46.899 --> 00:18:48.153
But you will find out

00:18:48.247 --> 00:18:51.752
they have entirely two different functions.

00:18:52.957 --> 00:18:55.543
The left sympathetic nervous caters

00:18:55.808 --> 00:19:00.039
to our emotional side which can be proved in Sahaja Yoga practice.

00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.166
Now on the right hand side,

00:19:06.264 --> 00:19:07.725
there is another power

00:19:08.353 --> 00:19:10.353
which is the power of action.

00:19:11.494 --> 00:19:15.660
When we desire, the desire has to be put into action.

00:19:16.886 --> 00:19:19.605
And this power of desire

00:19:20.874 --> 00:19:23.233
is called the prana Shakti,

00:19:24.075 --> 00:19:26.314
or the power of action

00:19:27.241 --> 00:19:29.241
the kriya Shakti, some people call it

00:19:29.869 --> 00:19:31.869
and it looks after

00:19:32.369 --> 00:19:34.369
our intellectual side,

00:19:34.869 --> 00:19:36.869
our intelligence

00:19:37.134 --> 00:19:40.535
and the mind with which we think about the mental side

00:19:41.633 --> 00:19:43.633
and our physical side,

00:19:44.133 --> 00:19:46.133
through which we go into action.

00:19:51.954 --> 00:19:55.258
This as a result of it’s activity creates

00:19:55.288 --> 00:19:57.416
another balloon you can see there,

00:19:57.446 --> 00:19:58.971
a yellow color balloon

00:19:59.321 --> 00:20:02.004
which we call as ego.

00:20:02.504 --> 00:20:04.504
EGO, ego.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:10.141
And this two powers meet at a point,

00:20:10.876 --> 00:20:12.876
when a child is about say

00:20:13.376 --> 00:20:16.416
12 years of age, he is completely

00:20:16.916 --> 00:20:18.174
calcified here.

00:20:18.674 --> 00:20:20.310
But in childhood only you see at

00:20:20.340 --> 00:20:22.769
the age of say one year or one and the half year,

00:20:22.906 --> 00:20:25.524
you start feeling the calcification,

00:20:25.682 --> 00:20:28.354
of this soft bone called as fontanel bone.

00:20:29.858 --> 00:20:32.939
In the center is the third power,

00:20:37.264 --> 00:20:42.101
called as the power of evolution.

00:20:43.733 --> 00:20:46.716
The power of sustenance.

00:20:48.092 --> 00:20:50.285
The power of religion

00:20:50.486 --> 00:20:51.930
which is innate within us.

00:20:52.430 --> 00:20:54.430
Now "religo" means a

00:20:56.404 --> 00:20:58.404
capacity, you can say a quality

00:21:00.143 --> 00:21:00.809
like

00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:04.590
gold is untarnishable,

00:21:04.983 --> 00:21:06.284
that is the quality of gold.

00:21:06.549 --> 00:21:08.549
Carbon has four valencies

00:21:08.750 --> 00:21:10.188
that is the quality of carbon.

00:21:10.688 --> 00:21:11.793
In the same way,

00:21:11.866 --> 00:21:15.009
human beings also have got ten sustenance

00:21:15.787 --> 00:21:18.198
and these ten sustenance are

00:21:18.698 --> 00:21:19.603
the dharma

00:21:20.338 --> 00:21:22.489
or the religions of a human being.

00:21:22.989 --> 00:21:26.131
It has nothing to do with outside religions, whatever you believe into

00:21:26.182 --> 00:21:29.016
or whatever you have fallen into or you are born into.

00:21:29.601 --> 00:21:32.078
But there are ten sustanances within us,

00:21:32.792 --> 00:21:34.920
which are in this area,

00:21:35.420 --> 00:21:39.826
call as, we call it as Void, but it's not the same void as Zen says,

00:21:40.903 --> 00:21:43.608
but is the visceral cavity

00:21:45.283 --> 00:21:46.410
in this area,

00:21:48.513 --> 00:21:51.823
we develop our sustenance.

00:21:54.716 --> 00:21:58.137
By developing our sustanance only we evolve.

00:21:58.530 --> 00:22:00.617
For example, first a fish

00:22:01.694 --> 00:22:04.574
came out of the water

00:22:06.527 --> 00:22:10.023
and developed a sustenance by it started crawling

00:22:10.074 --> 00:22:12.074
and it became a reptile.

00:22:12.574 --> 00:22:15.168
Firstly only one fish came

00:22:16.031 --> 00:22:17.069
and then

00:22:17.996 --> 00:22:20.546
shoals and shoals of fishes started

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:23.237
coming out of the water.

00:22:23.844 --> 00:22:24.705
So

00:22:26.444 --> 00:22:30.550
the evolution went on like this till we became human beings.

00:22:31.328 --> 00:22:32.643
In this process,

00:22:33.464 --> 00:22:34.865
as you know very well

00:22:36.391 --> 00:22:38.910
the left sided and the right sided animals,

00:22:38.940 --> 00:22:42.106
the right sided are the more ambitious, the dominating type.

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.200
The left sided are the sly.

00:22:44.549 --> 00:22:46.700
As you have many nocturnal animals

00:22:47.115 --> 00:22:48.051
they are all left sided,

00:22:49.491 --> 00:22:51.491
they're frightened and live in the left

00:22:52.098 --> 00:22:54.674
and those who are aggressive are on the right hand side.

00:22:55.815 --> 00:22:58.974
They were discarded even some vegetables and what you

00:22:59.025 --> 00:23:03.313
call the plants were discarded in the process of evolution.

00:23:04.625 --> 00:23:06.837
And they were thrown on the right and left side.

00:23:08.491 --> 00:23:13.234
And God created man in His own image.

00:23:14.781 --> 00:23:15.561
That means

00:23:18.027 --> 00:23:19.068
man has

00:23:21.220 --> 00:23:23.018
everything that God has.

00:23:23.518 --> 00:23:25.518
If He is the primordial being,

00:23:25.612 --> 00:23:28.547
He is the macrocosm then you are the microcosm,

00:23:29.132 --> 00:23:31.132
you are a cell in His body

00:23:32.764 --> 00:23:34.764
but you are not aware of that.

00:23:35.264 --> 00:23:38.223
There's a difference between awareness

00:23:38.723 --> 00:23:40.723
and just consciousness.

00:23:41.031 --> 00:23:43.698
Awareness is an actualization,

00:23:45.245 --> 00:23:46.638
while just to be conscious

00:23:46.689 --> 00:23:50.032
means mentally you believe, rationally you are a conscious, I know that,

00:23:50.853 --> 00:23:52.874
we think we are brothers and sisters.

00:23:56.323 --> 00:23:58.323
Now the centres that are

00:24:00.148 --> 00:24:02.536
placed within. The first one, as I told you,

00:24:03.036 --> 00:24:06.035
is the Mooladhara chakra.

00:24:07.881 --> 00:24:10.268
You will be happy to know that

00:24:10.768 --> 00:24:13.740
in the universe Australia is the Mooladhara chakra.

00:24:20.350 --> 00:24:22.760
It's a fact you will know that

00:24:23.666 --> 00:24:26.586
on vibrations if you ask a question you will know.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:28.918
Basically you are innocent people.

00:24:34.076 --> 00:24:37.070
You don't know also when you commit sins that this is sin,

00:24:37.143 --> 00:24:39.143
you just do it very innocently.

00:24:40.626 --> 00:24:43.652
You don't do it knowingly, innocently you do it.

00:24:46.973 --> 00:24:50.640
And the center second center,

00:24:51.429 --> 00:24:54.147
is the center called as Swadisthana chakra.

00:24:56.109 --> 00:24:59.182
The first center manifests your pelvic plexus.

00:25:05.545 --> 00:25:09.411
The right side, as I told you manifests the right sympathetic nervous system.

00:25:11.212 --> 00:25:13.568
The centre one manifests your

00:25:13.891 --> 00:25:17.172
parasympathetic which is broken, which is not yet complete.

00:25:19.246 --> 00:25:20.566
Whatever you have achieved

00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.908
in your awareness as a human being

00:25:23.055 --> 00:25:25.055
is there and there is little gap,

00:25:26.551 --> 00:25:27.928
where you have to just

00:25:28.990 --> 00:25:31.791
break through into that, and become

00:25:32.146 --> 00:25:34.653
united with that force.

00:25:38.044 --> 00:25:40.550
Now this second chakra

00:25:41.050 --> 00:25:43.656
is the chakra called as Swadisthana chakra,

00:25:44.702 --> 00:25:46.237
you need not worry about the names,

00:25:46.737 --> 00:25:49.931
but is the centre for action,

00:25:50.913 --> 00:25:54.181
by which you think, think for the future.

00:25:54.938 --> 00:25:57.670
And this center looks after

00:25:58.572 --> 00:25:59.549
many other

00:26:02.892 --> 00:26:05.038
visras or you can say organs within us.

00:26:06.261 --> 00:26:07.698
It looks after your liver.

00:26:08.824 --> 00:26:11.801
All attention is looked after by this centre.

00:26:12.751 --> 00:26:15.571
Liver, then it looks after

00:26:16.200 --> 00:26:18.589
your pancreas, your spleen,

00:26:19.089 --> 00:26:20.046
your kidneys

00:26:21.349 --> 00:26:23.868
and uterus in the women.

00:26:26.697 --> 00:26:28.778
The most important function of

00:26:28.828 --> 00:26:31.720
this centre is to manifest the aortic plexus,

00:26:33.585 --> 00:26:36.979
in the gross and to convert

00:26:38.154 --> 00:26:40.154
the fat cells of the stomach

00:26:41.393 --> 00:26:43.703
to replace the fat cells of the brain

00:26:45.263 --> 00:26:47.263
because after all the fat cells

00:26:48.582 --> 00:26:52.785
of the brain are to be replaced because you think, think, think, think

00:26:52.819 --> 00:26:54.297
and go mad with thinking.

00:26:55.070 --> 00:26:56.394
You think so much

00:26:56.782 --> 00:26:58.590
that as if two horns

00:26:58.688 --> 00:27:00.142
are coming out of your thinking.

00:27:02.521 --> 00:27:04.985
You may say the other day that "Mother,

00:27:05.405 --> 00:27:08.018
mind is very important because

00:27:08.437 --> 00:27:09.788
mind is the problem."

00:27:12.521 --> 00:27:15.002
Don't you know that this mind is limited?

00:27:15.663 --> 00:27:17.359
This rationality is limited.

00:27:18.196 --> 00:27:19.890
You have to go to unlimited.

00:27:20.727 --> 00:27:22.918
When I have to come to this hall,

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.559
we had to leave the car outside.

00:27:26.119 --> 00:27:28.869
This mind can go up to a point and if you

00:27:28.919 --> 00:27:30.373
try to go beyond that,

00:27:30.616 --> 00:27:32.616
then you really go crazy.

00:27:34.224 --> 00:27:36.224
We don't bring the cars inside,

00:27:37.961 --> 00:27:39.961
in the same way this mind

00:27:40.349 --> 00:27:42.478
cannot take you to the unlimited.

00:27:43.540 --> 00:27:46.585
It’s a limited thing, you have to go beyond the mind.

00:27:51.422 --> 00:27:54.734
This centre is doing this work

00:27:54.961 --> 00:27:58.733
of supplying the fat cells and when you think too much,

00:27:59.329 --> 00:28:03.477
all other visaras or all other organs are

00:28:05.326 --> 00:28:08.489
not looked after, are neglected by which

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:14.687
the person who thinks too much

00:28:15.508 --> 00:28:18.110
who lives in the future, who plans too much,

00:28:19.686 --> 00:28:23.443
also then drinks, in addition to that, supposing,

00:28:24.457 --> 00:28:26.024
and in addition to that

00:28:26.765 --> 00:28:28.541
he does other things like

00:28:28.575 --> 00:28:31.266
drug taking in the stomach and eats lots of fat food

00:28:31.284 --> 00:28:34.276
and all that, so he really finishes that poor liver.

00:28:36.639 --> 00:28:39.461
And that liver is the one that sorts out

00:28:39.961 --> 00:28:42.946
all your poisons in the body, all kinds of poison.

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:48.193
But this liver gets out of order

00:28:48.564 --> 00:28:51.585
and you don't feel it, only the heat starts accumulating,

00:28:52.438 --> 00:28:54.261
you feel always nauseating

00:28:54.311 --> 00:28:57.628
and you feel so unhappy, you don't want to face the present,

00:28:57.823 --> 00:28:58.982
you want to run away.

00:28:59.193 --> 00:29:01.193
You feel extremely horrid

00:29:01.532 --> 00:29:03.532
you don't know what to do with yourself.

00:29:03.598 --> 00:29:05.598
All that comes from a bad liver.

00:29:08.636 --> 00:29:11.182
Also apart from liver

00:29:12.132 --> 00:29:12.870
your

00:29:15.105 --> 00:29:16.428
pancreas goes

00:29:16.928 --> 00:29:19.802
out and you develop a disease called diabetes.

00:29:21.250 --> 00:29:24.402
With that you also try some coffee and all those things,

00:29:25.095 --> 00:29:25.769
which add up.

00:29:26.269 --> 00:29:28.269
I mean coffee, the amount of coffee

00:29:28.299 --> 00:29:30.769
people consumes, sometimes I can't understand.

00:29:32.522 --> 00:29:36.031
And that coffee can really spoil the pancreas

00:29:36.189 --> 00:29:37.163
to such an extent

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.447
that you can develop

00:29:40.118 --> 00:29:42.627
even more serious diseases

00:29:42.816 --> 00:29:44.816
than diabetes of the pancreas.

00:29:45.316 --> 00:29:48.538
Beyond the pancreas lies the spleen.

00:29:49.675 --> 00:29:53.351
Spleen is the real victim of modern people,

00:29:53.851 --> 00:29:56.531
real victim is poor spleen.

00:29:57.264 --> 00:30:01.202
Spleen is the one which is the speedometer within us,

00:30:01.702 --> 00:30:03.702
it regulates your speed.

00:30:05.647 --> 00:30:08.268
When you are eating your food,

00:30:09.156 --> 00:30:10.830
you suddenly open the news

00:30:11.330 --> 00:30:13.926
on the TV or something, horrible things happen.

00:30:14.426 --> 00:30:17.003
You get so shocked and emergencies built-in,

00:30:17.503 --> 00:30:20.702
the spleen is already the busy producing RBC’s,

00:30:20.845 --> 00:30:24.184
red corpuscles for the digestion of the food,

00:30:25.430 --> 00:30:27.655
and suddenly it has another emergency, and

00:30:27.689 --> 00:30:30.174
a third emergency. The way we take our breakfast,

00:30:31.094 --> 00:30:33.768
half sandwich in the mouth and half

00:30:34.999 --> 00:30:35.995
outside

00:30:36.386 --> 00:30:40.012
stepping into the car, telling your wife that do this, do that

00:30:40.512 --> 00:30:43.966
and then rush through the rat race,

00:30:44.590 --> 00:30:45.998
ending up yourself

00:30:46.498 --> 00:30:50.428
into a very crazy spleen.

00:30:50.617 --> 00:30:52.255
The spleen does not know

00:30:53.346 --> 00:30:56.242
how to carry on with your telescopic behavior

00:30:57.162 --> 00:30:59.162
and it go so very crazy

00:30:59.662 --> 00:31:03.004
that it starts producing crazy cells

00:31:03.504 --> 00:31:05.504
and these are the crazy cells

00:31:06.004 --> 00:31:07.879
which create ultimately

00:31:07.975 --> 00:31:10.756
a very serious disease called blood cancer.

00:31:13.059 --> 00:31:14.986
The other day somebody asked me a question,

00:31:14.995 --> 00:31:17.672
"Mother, how the children get blood cancer?"

00:31:18.749 --> 00:31:21.355
I said if I tell you you shouldn’t be angry with me,

00:31:21.855 --> 00:31:24.668
but when we are after the life of our children,

00:31:24.741 --> 00:31:26.439
poor things, they are small children.

00:31:27.067 --> 00:31:29.457
We are trying to make them good citizens.

00:31:54.850 --> 00:31:58.142
So this crazy spleen, becomes

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:01.860
absolutely uncontrollable

00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:05.768
it start producing blood cells

00:32:06.118 --> 00:32:09.765
which become malignant. They go at random,

00:32:10.051 --> 00:32:13.290
any time and the malignancy starts

00:32:13.619 --> 00:32:15.619
where one cell becomes very big,

00:32:15.969 --> 00:32:18.968
unique as we are also malignant people sometimes.

00:32:19.254 --> 00:32:21.537
You want to be unique people in the society,

00:32:21.716 --> 00:32:24.303
engulfing everybody, encroaching on other people,

00:32:24.331 --> 00:32:27.466
in this competition we want to have everything to ourselves,

00:32:28.051 --> 00:32:29.339
and by the time

00:32:30.715 --> 00:32:33.477
you are old, you find your hands are shaking,

00:32:33.509 --> 00:32:35.977
feet are shaking, you can't walk properly

00:32:36.263 --> 00:32:38.761
or you develop diseases like say,

00:32:39.560 --> 00:32:41.560
heart attack, or a stroke.

00:32:44.453 --> 00:32:47.769
This rat race is

00:32:48.675 --> 00:32:51.480
very competitive. Competition for what?

00:32:53.646 --> 00:32:55.951
Everybody should be able to grow

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.750
in relation to others.

00:32:59.250 --> 00:33:02.406
For example, if your nose only starts growing like that,

00:33:03.269 --> 00:33:05.547
not in relation to your body or face,

00:33:05.556 --> 00:33:07.556
what is going to happen to the rest of it?

00:33:09.851 --> 00:33:12.303
To be on your own, I’m on my own,

00:33:15.025 --> 00:33:17.025
and then you start growing

00:33:17.354 --> 00:33:20.505
without any relationship or co-ordination with the other

00:33:20.535 --> 00:33:22.172
parts of the society,

00:33:22.672 --> 00:33:24.434
other parts of the world,

00:33:25.725 --> 00:33:27.123
then you become malignant.

00:33:28.478 --> 00:33:32.085
You lose all balance, you don't know what you are doing.

00:33:36.239 --> 00:33:38.239
This is the tragedy

00:33:38.739 --> 00:33:41.080
that when this happens to us

00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:43.211
we are so ego-orientated

00:33:43.711 --> 00:33:45.472
that the pangs are not felt

00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:48.314
till you reach a stage, that suddenly you find

00:33:48.472 --> 00:33:51.729
a person goes they you call it in English - "ga-ga",

00:33:52.229 --> 00:33:54.229
American English.

00:33:56.844 --> 00:33:59.695
You find them, they can't talk, I have seen it

00:34:00.772 --> 00:34:02.772
in Paris. Some people,

00:34:02.909 --> 00:34:04.909
not very old, younger to me in age,

00:34:05.409 --> 00:34:07.409
walk into a bus

00:34:07.546 --> 00:34:09.080
and they are talking loudly,

00:34:09.366 --> 00:34:11.366
all sorts of French words

00:34:11.866 --> 00:34:13.866
and I asked what are they doing?

00:34:14.366 --> 00:34:17.445
They said, "Mother they are talking about last war. I said why?

00:34:17.945 --> 00:34:20.354
They said they just go on talking like this, they're gone.

00:34:20.854 --> 00:34:24.253
They are, what did you say, out of the deck.

00:34:28.514 --> 00:34:32.176
Because you are having such a running jump towards the hell,

00:34:33.808 --> 00:34:36.730
that the progress, so called,

00:34:38.118 --> 00:34:42.704
will make our society into very funny people

00:34:43.095 --> 00:34:45.204
who are jittery,

00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.376
who are twitching their heads, necks and everything

00:34:50.148 --> 00:34:54.045
and their children are so aggressive,

00:34:55.578 --> 00:34:59.959
that it is impossible to understand why they're behaving like this.

00:35:05.767 --> 00:35:07.099
We have to understand

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:10.322
that we are part and parcel of the whole.

00:35:12.108 --> 00:35:14.108
And anything that is done

00:35:14.536 --> 00:35:16.608
without the relationship of other

00:35:17.869 --> 00:35:18.869
can create

00:35:20.836 --> 00:35:25.063
tremendous problems for the whole world as it is and it is creating.

00:35:28.969 --> 00:35:31.901
The second centre is very important

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:33.930
for modern people as I told you,

00:35:35.771 --> 00:35:38.656
because when you start thinking too much also,

00:35:39.029 --> 00:35:41.029
what you do is use your right side,

00:35:42.163 --> 00:35:44.163
and the left side gets frozen.

00:35:45.333 --> 00:35:46.466
By improving

00:35:47.636 --> 00:35:49.636
on your thinking processes,

00:35:49.937 --> 00:35:51.938
thinking too much of the future and

00:35:51.949 --> 00:35:54.438
planning and of course most of the plans go waste.

00:35:55.246 --> 00:35:57.924
Such a lost of energy we waste in thinking

00:35:58.949 --> 00:36:02.886
that we find that if we had not thought so much,

00:36:03.006 --> 00:36:05.006
we would not have been that much frustrated.

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:10.156
The planning also to such an extent

00:36:10.656 --> 00:36:11.855
doesn't help in any way.

00:36:12.754 --> 00:36:14.754
Supposing I have to come to this hall

00:36:14.946 --> 00:36:16.346
and I do not know the way.

00:36:16.846 --> 00:36:18.411
What planning can I have?

00:36:18.929 --> 00:36:21.193
I have just to ask somebody how do you go there

00:36:21.331 --> 00:36:22.932
and face as it is.

00:36:23.722 --> 00:36:27.490
Supposing a seed has to grow into a root -

00:36:28.117 --> 00:36:30.117
does it have any planning before hand?

00:36:30.708 --> 00:36:33.861
It does not. What it does is that it faces.

00:36:34.035 --> 00:36:36.035
It's a little cell, and so wise,

00:36:36.318 --> 00:36:38.755
and it knows that there is an obstruction, no use

00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:40.656
fighting with this rock,

00:36:41.156 --> 00:36:42.466
so it goes around,

00:36:42.821 --> 00:36:45.957
all soft places it pierces

00:36:46.457 --> 00:36:49.693
and gets itself embedded sensibly and wisely

00:36:49.758 --> 00:36:51.152
and uses that rock,

00:36:51.453 --> 00:36:54.995
uses that rock for the strengthening of the tree.

00:36:57.198 --> 00:36:59.924
So when we try to dominate others,

00:37:00.424 --> 00:37:04.679
I mean the sophisticated, the more sophisticated you get,

00:37:05.179 --> 00:37:08.888
the more sophisticated this ego gets

00:37:10.113 --> 00:37:13.809
and with that sophistication you are very pleased, sorry,

00:37:14.363 --> 00:37:17.347
yes and all those things are there,

00:37:17.611 --> 00:37:20.540
but inside a big Mr. ego is developing,

00:37:21.348 --> 00:37:24.226
like a balloon. And it presses down

00:37:25.088 --> 00:37:26.761
your superego,

00:37:29.054 --> 00:37:30.676
and it comes down.

00:37:31.466 --> 00:37:33.791
Now the gap that is between the two

00:37:33.947 --> 00:37:35.984
or the place where it should be is not there

00:37:37.027 --> 00:37:39.371
and ego presses down the superego,

00:37:39.871 --> 00:37:42.753
till superego starts seeing

00:37:44.811 --> 00:37:46.176
the colossal ego.

00:37:47.654 --> 00:37:51.381
And then such a person takes to escapes,

00:37:51.790 --> 00:37:53.247
it takes to alcohol,

00:37:53.403 --> 00:37:55.403
which gives rise to superego

00:37:56.048 --> 00:37:58.048
or it takes to drugs

00:37:58.947 --> 00:38:00.947
and all kinds of escapes in life

00:38:01.429 --> 00:38:04.344
to run away from his own ego because he can't bear it.

00:38:06.474 --> 00:38:08.744
Now the wobbling starts,

00:38:09.769 --> 00:38:11.769
the ego and superego starts wobbling

00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:16.678
and that's how you get people who are absolutely confused.

00:38:19.859 --> 00:38:22.588
Moreover, to add up to the whole problem

00:38:25.334 --> 00:38:27.892
the modern times are the ones

00:38:29.570 --> 00:38:31.079
that in this confusion,

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:35.526
last judgment has already started.

00:38:36.968 --> 00:38:39.202
Through your Kundalini awakening only

00:38:39.358 --> 00:38:41.358
you will judge yourself

00:38:41.858 --> 00:38:43.100
and correct yourself

00:38:44.035 --> 00:38:46.378
and you will enter into the kingdom of God.

00:38:49.088 --> 00:38:51.286
These confusions

00:38:53.163 --> 00:38:57.671
actually have led human beings to such frantic

00:38:58.225 --> 00:39:00.225
precarious ages

00:39:00.725 --> 00:39:02.725
that Sahaja Yoga

00:39:03.225 --> 00:39:04.784
had to come on this earth,

00:39:06.009 --> 00:39:09.076
to solve the problems once for all.

00:39:10.681 --> 00:39:12.389
After getting Realisation,

00:39:12.436 --> 00:39:14.941
it's so remarkable when you find your absolute

00:39:15.006 --> 00:39:17.006
through Kundalini awakening

00:39:17.506 --> 00:39:20.635
I have seen people overnight they give up so many things.

00:39:21.135 --> 00:39:23.135
Like I know of an old man,

00:39:24.722 --> 00:39:26.866
very old man, in Singapore

00:39:26.931 --> 00:39:29.131
who is very well known, very rich man

00:39:29.196 --> 00:39:31.196
and a very well known personality,

00:39:33.707 --> 00:39:36.147
and he got his Realisation

00:39:36.248 --> 00:39:38.705
and he told me that overnight,

00:39:38.825 --> 00:39:40.516
"I gave up my gambling,

00:39:40.762 --> 00:39:42.485
I gave up my drinking

00:39:42.858 --> 00:39:45.370
and I gave up my racing".

00:39:47.374 --> 00:39:49.374
These are also escapes in life,

00:39:49.620 --> 00:39:51.620
these are all escapes

00:39:52.718 --> 00:39:54.718
because we are so bored of ourselves.

00:39:54.783 --> 00:39:56.509
Imagine a person is imprisoned.

00:39:58.153 --> 00:40:00.428
If he is just imprisoned in a nice place,

00:40:00.475 --> 00:40:02.805
he should not feel upset. After all

00:40:02.852 --> 00:40:04.554
it's a very good thing to face yourself,

00:40:04.565 --> 00:40:06.565
that's the most beautiful thing we have.

00:40:08.043 --> 00:40:11.056
But because we are so frightened of ourselves only,

00:40:11.556 --> 00:40:14.373
that we don't want to be left alone, we think that we are lonely.

00:40:16.105 --> 00:40:18.105
We want to run away from ourselves.

00:40:19.004 --> 00:40:20.385
We want to have somebody else is

00:40:20.414 --> 00:40:23.313
better to have somebody else, and even when somebody else comes in,

00:40:23.433 --> 00:40:25.433
we do not want to face him squarely

00:40:26.205 --> 00:40:28.205
but we want to have something in between,

00:40:28.306 --> 00:40:30.306
like a bottle of beer or something.

00:40:33.070 --> 00:40:36.708
After Realisation you first time start enjoying each other.

00:40:37.661 --> 00:40:40.783
You first time start feeling the vibrations on another person

00:40:41.283 --> 00:40:44.501
and you really enjoy the beauty of another person's

00:40:44.838 --> 00:40:47.038
through this cool breeze that is coming

00:40:47.158 --> 00:40:49.158
out of the being of that person.

00:40:50.999 --> 00:40:52.999
And this should happen to all of you.

00:40:53.770 --> 00:40:55.770
You all should achieve it,

00:40:56.198 --> 00:40:59.353
it's very important because you are out and out seekers.

00:40:59.726 --> 00:41:01.799
But first you must have your self-estimation.

00:41:02.498 --> 00:41:04.842
You must know that you are not here to play

00:41:05.342 --> 00:41:07.342
these games with yourself.

00:41:07.842 --> 00:41:09.842
All kinds of games are available.

00:41:09.907 --> 00:41:11.617
The industries have provided,

00:41:11.881 --> 00:41:13.881
the Industrial Revolution has provided,

00:41:14.381 --> 00:41:17.531
all modern thinkers and the books and all that have got it

00:41:17.777 --> 00:41:21.408
and to add it gurus have come from India to supply

00:41:22.470 --> 00:41:23.872
this demand market.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:26.650
So the picture is complete.

00:41:27.838 --> 00:41:31.172
This should not upset,

00:41:32.614 --> 00:41:37.264
because behind all fakeness and falsehood there has to be the reality.

00:41:38.362 --> 00:41:40.650
If you see thousands of

00:41:41.150 --> 00:41:44.957
artificial flowers you must know there has to be one real rose.

00:41:46.381 --> 00:41:50.373
And in the same way behind all this falsehood

00:41:52.177 --> 00:41:55.425
and confusion there is reality

00:41:55.599 --> 00:41:57.599
which is so beautiful within yourself

00:41:58.298 --> 00:42:00.759
which you have to achieve through Kundalini awakening.

00:42:01.476 --> 00:42:04.302
In short now I will tell you about the other centres

00:42:04.621 --> 00:42:06.621
because if you go through this book

00:42:07.266 --> 00:42:08.165
you will know

00:42:08.285 --> 00:42:11.117
about the names and things but in short I can tell you.

00:42:11.726 --> 00:42:13.028
That the third centre

00:42:13.184 --> 00:42:14.822
is the centre of our seeking

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:18.658
is the center by which we are seeking,

00:42:19.012 --> 00:42:21.012
is the navel centre is

00:42:21.658 --> 00:42:24.886
by which amoeba, an amoeba felt hungry,

00:42:25.386 --> 00:42:28.704
he was seeking food. In seeking food only

00:42:29.204 --> 00:42:31.478
we went up to the stage of

00:42:32.215 --> 00:42:34.765
say mammoth and all these big animals.

00:42:34.882 --> 00:42:36.882
But they were such unwieldly big things

00:42:37.528 --> 00:42:39.528
that they could not maintain themselves.

00:42:39.882 --> 00:42:42.153
So then the intelligent animals came in.

00:42:42.434 --> 00:42:43.522
In that also

00:42:43.712 --> 00:42:45.712
some of them were very horrid ones

00:42:45.884 --> 00:42:47.392
like foxes and all that.

00:42:48.530 --> 00:42:51.373
Then very powerful animals came up

00:42:51.509 --> 00:42:53.509
who had more physical power

00:42:53.718 --> 00:42:55.718
than their big body.

00:42:55.908 --> 00:42:57.908
Like that we develop

00:42:57.971 --> 00:43:01.339
with this seeking up to a point when we became really human beings

00:43:01.985 --> 00:43:04.224
and when we became human beings

00:43:04.378 --> 00:43:08.101
we started seeking things like possessions;

00:43:08.802 --> 00:43:11.852
if not possession, like power,

00:43:12.206 --> 00:43:18.215
in politics, economics, social work, social things

00:43:18.897 --> 00:43:20.897
and lastly, the Spirit.

00:43:22.326 --> 00:43:25.162
Spirit is the solution for all of them.

00:43:27.483 --> 00:43:31.104
Without the light you cannot see anything in this world.

00:43:32.442 --> 00:43:35.308
I cannot see you without any light in there.

00:43:35.626 --> 00:43:41.332
To me, in darkness you are nothing but darkness. I don't see it.

00:43:42.597 --> 00:43:44.597
I cannot relate one to another.

00:43:44.769 --> 00:43:48.792
I do not know who are sitting here and listening to me,

00:43:49.893 --> 00:43:53.342
but once there is light you can see everything clearly,

00:43:53.842 --> 00:43:55.622
and that's what it is, happens.

00:43:55.758 --> 00:43:57.758
That when you get your enlightenment

00:43:58.258 --> 00:44:00.929
you become the master of yourself.

00:44:03.250 --> 00:44:05.899
This is the end of the seeking which starts.

00:44:06.399 --> 00:44:09.102
In this seeking only, around the seeking

00:44:09.602 --> 00:44:13.173
are our sustenance’s are developed gradually

00:44:13.436 --> 00:44:15.563
and ultimately we become human beings.

00:44:15.771 --> 00:44:18.376
And for human beings there are ten sustenance’s

00:44:18.767 --> 00:44:20.767
described in the Ten Commandments.

00:44:20.921 --> 00:44:22.921
When I talk about Ten Commandments,

00:44:23.421 --> 00:44:25.348
a one gentleman got very angry and said "You are

00:44:25.374 --> 00:44:27.374
a Christian, you are a Christian, you are a Christian!"

00:44:29.295 --> 00:44:31.295
But Ten Commandments were written

00:44:31.522 --> 00:44:34.036
when there were Jews, they were not written,

00:44:34.135 --> 00:44:36.406
Moses was not a Christian, he was a Jew

00:44:36.451 --> 00:44:38.177
and the Jew got angry with me

00:44:38.367 --> 00:44:39.857
that I was a Christian.

00:44:41.304 --> 00:44:42.560
Moses, Abraham,

00:44:44.299 --> 00:44:46.299
Confucius, Socrates,

00:44:48.311 --> 00:44:51.340
Mohammed, Nanak, Janak,

00:44:52.059 --> 00:44:54.645
Lao Tse, these are the

00:44:55.837 --> 00:44:57.837
Primordial masters.

00:44:58.865 --> 00:45:01.717
The principle of primordial masters, the Adi-Gurus

00:45:02.181 --> 00:45:03.783
who incarnated on this earth

00:45:04.356 --> 00:45:07.890
to teach us how to keep our sustenance.

00:45:08.736 --> 00:45:12.936
They taught against all strong alcohols and strong things.

00:45:13.254 --> 00:45:15.254
Christ did not talk

00:45:15.991 --> 00:45:17.617
but it does not mean that when He said

00:45:17.643 --> 00:45:19.643
He converted into wine, means He

00:45:19.706 --> 00:45:20.900
fermented the wine.

00:45:20.948 --> 00:45:23.400
You cannot ferment the wine in a minute, you understand that.

00:45:24.902 --> 00:45:27.899
Wine is a very common word, even today if you go

00:45:28.399 --> 00:45:30.783
will find that wine means

00:45:31.848 --> 00:45:33.515
grapes. I mean even

00:45:34.015 --> 00:45:36.015
a creeper of the grape is called a wine,

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:38.260
even the juice of he thing is called wine.

00:45:38.596 --> 00:45:40.606
Now to differentiate we are starting to call it

00:45:40.632 --> 00:45:42.632
grape juice. But it is very, very

00:45:42.640 --> 00:45:44.064
loose, but you will be surprised it is a very

00:45:44.218 --> 00:45:47.607
... About fifty years back people must have started or something like that

00:45:47.852 --> 00:45:50.806
in India, but may be abroad, I don't know.

00:45:50.922 --> 00:45:55.098
Even today many people call it a wine "raksasia",

00:45:55.397 --> 00:45:58.253
even in Indian language it is called as the wine.

00:45:58.534 --> 00:46:01.070
Any grape juice is called as a wine.

00:46:02.795 --> 00:46:05.308
So there are many other things

00:46:05.388 --> 00:46:06.971
which these people told us

00:46:07.124 --> 00:46:09.958
that you should not do, to keep yourself in the centre.

00:46:11.427 --> 00:46:15.732
Now I divide our mistakes into categories.

00:46:18.298 --> 00:46:21.440
The first mistake we have is not to believe

00:46:21.702 --> 00:46:23.259
that God Almighty

00:46:23.759 --> 00:46:25.759
is going to look after our well-being.

00:46:26.844 --> 00:46:28.844
Krishna has said very clearly

00:46:29.070 --> 00:46:31.361
that Yoga kshemam Vahaamyaham. Meaning

00:46:31.386 --> 00:46:34.224
after Yoga, after union with God,

00:46:34.724 --> 00:46:36.724
I will look after your well being.

00:46:38.942 --> 00:46:40.942
That means you should get connected.

00:46:41.205 --> 00:46:43.442
Supposing I am not an Australian citizen

00:46:43.558 --> 00:46:45.906
why will Australian Government look after me?

00:46:47.741 --> 00:46:50.249
In the same way if you are not the members

00:46:50.658 --> 00:46:52.231
of God's community

00:46:52.495 --> 00:46:55.487
or if you are not entered into the Kingdom of God

00:46:55.805 --> 00:46:57.987
or if you are not a citizen of His Kingdom,

00:46:58.834 --> 00:47:01.855
it is not His responsibility to look after your well being.

00:47:02.721 --> 00:47:06.083
I mean of course He has created you, so He looks after you.

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:12.231
But otherwise it's not certain that He'll look after you.

00:47:15.857 --> 00:47:18.931
People demand so much from God,

00:47:19.431 --> 00:47:21.063
they think they are already connected.

00:47:21.746 --> 00:47:25.519
They treat Him as if you can find Him somewhere under the stone.

00:47:26.951 --> 00:47:29.336
They go on demanding please look after my son,

00:47:29.379 --> 00:47:31.379
please do this, praying morning till evening,

00:47:31.879 --> 00:47:32.986
I mean it's pestering.

00:47:34.327 --> 00:47:36.086
When you are not connected with God,

00:47:36.879 --> 00:47:38.154
if you go on

00:47:38.654 --> 00:47:40.965
doing like this to any human being also,

00:47:41.319 --> 00:47:42.330
you'll get arrested.

00:47:45.591 --> 00:47:48.366
And that's what happens, that we live under myths:

00:47:48.372 --> 00:47:51.909
"Oh I have been praying and God has given me this,

00:47:53.341 --> 00:47:55.341
and I have been doing this."

00:47:55.439 --> 00:47:57.439
But we don't see, do we deserve it?

00:47:58.835 --> 00:48:02.500
Are we the Spirit? Have we tried to be the Spirit?

00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.498
We have done all kinds of things but to be the Spirit.

00:48:07.272 --> 00:48:10.644
When you are the Spirit then you are really blessed -

00:48:11.144 --> 00:48:12.031
really blessed,

00:48:13.409 --> 00:48:15.409
not only by His powers

00:48:15.708 --> 00:48:17.708
but you become the master of your being,

00:48:18.117 --> 00:48:21.001
and you start manifesting your own powers.

00:48:23.713 --> 00:48:26.438
This seeking and the surrounding dharma

00:48:27.176 --> 00:48:29.376
which is looked after by the Primordial masters

00:48:30.041 --> 00:48:34.085
is another centre here, above that is the centre

00:48:34.804 --> 00:48:36.804
of the Mother of the Universe,

00:48:36.865 --> 00:48:38.530
who gives us the security.

00:48:41.359 --> 00:48:43.466
This one when spoiled

00:48:43.643 --> 00:48:45.966
the security, the sense of security spoiled

00:48:46.252 --> 00:48:47.505
especially among women,

00:48:48.005 --> 00:48:51.183
when they feel that their husband are negligent or they are

00:48:51.875 --> 00:48:54.810
flirting with other women and all sorts of things.

00:48:55.417 --> 00:48:57.633
Then this centre goes but of order.

00:48:58.667 --> 00:49:00.667
When this centre goes out of order,

00:49:01.167 --> 00:49:05.127
then they develop diseases like breast cancer.

00:49:08.362 --> 00:49:09.503
Breast cancer

00:49:09.533 --> 00:49:12.911
is more common in societies where they have divorces.

00:49:14.266 --> 00:49:16.439
I have given a regular speech on this

00:49:16.554 --> 00:49:19.227
which you should get from Sydney and you will know all about it.

00:49:20.176 --> 00:49:22.475
Now the right side heart which you see here

00:49:22.825 --> 00:49:24.825
is the centre of a Father,

00:49:25.389 --> 00:49:27.737
the left one is the centre of the Mother.

00:49:30.438 --> 00:49:34.257
The right side heart centre catches when as a father

00:49:34.565 --> 00:49:36.162
you have not done your duties

00:49:36.769 --> 00:49:39.109
or if your father has died very early,

00:49:39.823 --> 00:49:42.795
you were shocked, then also it can happen.

00:49:43.658 --> 00:49:46.515
Anorexia and all these diseases can also be

00:49:46.737 --> 00:49:49.020
caused by this kind of happenings

00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:51.498
or also asthma.

00:49:51.763 --> 00:49:54.387
Asthma is invariably is caused

00:49:54.887 --> 00:49:56.887
by this centre going out of order.

00:49:59.331 --> 00:50:01.763
The left side is the centre of the Mother,

00:50:02.690 --> 00:50:04.927
our father and mother we chose.

00:50:06.153 --> 00:50:08.153
Before our birth we chose them.

00:50:08.717 --> 00:50:11.389
It was foolish to choose horrible parents.

00:50:12.039 --> 00:50:13.362
But you better pay for it.

00:50:15.379 --> 00:50:16.887
In one lifetime

00:50:17.195 --> 00:50:19.519
it is better to pay for the horrible ones

00:50:19.741 --> 00:50:21.741
so that next time you won't have them again.

00:50:24.634 --> 00:50:27.376
But we are not to judge them.

00:50:27.876 --> 00:50:29.609
If they are not seekers

00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:31.852
it's a very difficult thing to live with them, I know.

00:50:32.673 --> 00:50:34.673
It's very difficult to live with parents

00:50:34.767 --> 00:50:36.507
who are morning till evening

00:50:36.559 --> 00:50:40.070
counting every penny, counting every tin which are emptied,

00:50:40.314 --> 00:50:43.867
every tube that is emptied, they store up,

00:50:44.175 --> 00:50:45.614
they are so materialistic

00:50:46.114 --> 00:50:49.550
and you just can't bear such people, I can quite understand.

00:50:50.050 --> 00:50:52.685
Even a wife could be like that, and a husband could be like that,

00:50:52.843 --> 00:50:54.843
extremely materialistic, you will be fed up.

00:50:55.343 --> 00:50:59.064
They write down everything, every lamp post they must know,

00:51:00.312 --> 00:51:02.569
count everything.

00:51:02.791 --> 00:51:04.985
Today a lady who interviewed me asked me,

00:51:05.164 --> 00:51:08.161
"How many people, Mother, have you given Realisation

00:51:08.490 --> 00:51:10.555
and how many people you have cured."

00:51:10.649 --> 00:51:13.018
I said "You better ask the sun first of all

00:51:13.091 --> 00:51:15.894
how many leaves it has made green, then talk to me."

00:51:19.727 --> 00:51:21.480
I never write any accounts,

00:51:21.546 --> 00:51:24.514
leave alone of human beings, even of money.

00:51:25.014 --> 00:51:26.647
I never write, I have no time,

00:51:26.677 --> 00:51:29.250
I have no understanding as how to write accounts.

00:51:29.280 --> 00:51:32.388
Next life maybe I will be an accountant, for your information.

00:51:36.435 --> 00:51:40.726
So this happens to us when we become

00:51:42.252 --> 00:51:44.762
against our parents.

00:51:45.262 --> 00:51:48.034
I don't say that you should carry on

00:51:48.299 --> 00:51:50.351
with mad people, there's no use

00:51:50.381 --> 00:51:53.516
asking the bull to come and hit you, is correct.

00:51:54.016 --> 00:51:55.738
But you need not judge them,

00:51:55.832 --> 00:51:57.255
you can leave them, stay away

00:51:57.328 --> 00:51:59.328
and do not have them in your life, it's alright.

00:52:00.127 --> 00:52:02.509
But if you are taking

00:52:02.774 --> 00:52:05.896
interest in them as well as fighting with them morning till evening,

00:52:06.033 --> 00:52:07.712
then you catch on this heart chakra.

00:52:09.451 --> 00:52:13.066
I would say that in this respect Indians are sensible people.

00:52:14.143 --> 00:52:17.619
They are very sensible that they keep their parents all right.

00:52:18.226 --> 00:52:19.841
And the parents are also yet

00:52:19.985 --> 00:52:22.469
very sensible people. They love their children, they give

00:52:22.478 --> 00:52:24.478
everything that they have to the children,

00:52:24.615 --> 00:52:30.271
and children start really loving their parents,

00:52:30.429 --> 00:52:32.429
till they die they look after them.

00:52:33.933 --> 00:52:36.387
The result of that is of course very bad,

00:52:36.887 --> 00:52:40.274
because here in all the western countries the parents

00:52:40.475 --> 00:52:43.299
are still in a bridal mood, I mean they are brides

00:52:43.991 --> 00:52:45.991
and the bridegrooms you see

00:52:46.491 --> 00:52:49.709
they never become old enough to be parents.

00:52:49.740 --> 00:52:51.587
Seen even an eighty year old man you will find

00:52:51.595 --> 00:52:53.765
marry an eighteen year old girl. I mean

00:52:53.816 --> 00:52:55.816
it's a thing going on all the time. God knows

00:52:56.316 --> 00:52:58.316
what sort of intelligence is that?

00:52:59.008 --> 00:53:01.500
But with all that happening

00:53:01.658 --> 00:53:03.658
poor children do not know

00:53:03.923 --> 00:53:05.605
which parents to be chosen.

00:53:06.105 --> 00:53:08.427
And the last judgement has started, now what to do?

00:53:09.269 --> 00:53:11.269
Now you place yourself in their places

00:53:11.342 --> 00:53:12.674
and think what would you do

00:53:12.768 --> 00:53:14.938
when you know such crazy parents that today

00:53:14.947 --> 00:53:16.712
they are together, tomorrow they are divorced.

00:53:17.212 --> 00:53:19.082
On the streets they will be kissing,

00:53:19.347 --> 00:53:20.647
hugging each other,

00:53:21.147 --> 00:53:24.459
doing all kind of nonsensical thing. Very embarrassing also,

00:53:25.579 --> 00:53:26.745
and if you ask them where are you

00:53:26.796 --> 00:53:28.796
going they say they are going to the divorce case.

00:53:32.672 --> 00:53:36.248
These kinds of absurdities are taking place and because of that

00:53:36.748 --> 00:53:38.748
children don't want to get birth

00:53:39.974 --> 00:53:41.824
in all these places; England,

00:53:41.851 --> 00:53:44.452
Germany, Switzerland, everywhere.

00:53:45.358 --> 00:53:49.441
The birth rate is towards the minus side.

00:53:49.941 --> 00:53:51.941
In Germany especially, West Germany

00:53:52.227 --> 00:53:54.468
and East Germany of all the things

00:53:54.519 --> 00:53:57.707
people give so much money that a woman if she produces

00:53:57.780 --> 00:54:01.062
three children she earns more money than their Prime Minister.

00:54:01.562 --> 00:54:03.562
But still women don't want to produce.

00:54:04.062 --> 00:54:06.839
They want to be free, independent, they don't want to be mothers.

00:54:07.617 --> 00:54:09.940
As a result this poor India

00:54:09.991 --> 00:54:12.856
has to accommodate for all the children born today

00:54:14.296 --> 00:54:17.582
and we are blamed for over population,

00:54:18.082 --> 00:54:20.718
now what to do? We have to bear the load.

00:54:24.017 --> 00:54:26.622
So also it is your responsibility

00:54:27.015 --> 00:54:29.299
to see if you do not produce children

00:54:29.350 --> 00:54:31.437
at least those who are producing children

00:54:31.638 --> 00:54:35.229
have some compassion for them

00:54:35.387 --> 00:54:37.474
and have some understanding.

00:54:37.504 --> 00:54:39.976
Do not blame them. Oh everybody tells me,

00:54:40.155 --> 00:54:42.802
what about your problem of population.

00:54:43.708 --> 00:54:47.295
I tell them now who is responsible for our population

00:54:49.291 --> 00:54:52.391
because in that country even if you have fourteen children,

00:54:52.891 --> 00:54:54.891
they love all their children that are there.

00:54:55.989 --> 00:54:59.429
They are not so ego-orientated that their hearts are not closed,

00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:02.420
they are not so unemotional,

00:55:03.198 --> 00:55:07.317
anybody who has no child will go to

00:55:07.368 --> 00:55:08.916
all the holy places

00:55:09.587 --> 00:55:12.084
and ask for blessings that they should get children,

00:55:13.161 --> 00:55:14.222
to get a child

00:55:14.231 --> 00:55:17.785
is such a blessing in India and child is such an important thing.

00:55:20.123 --> 00:55:22.530
But the mistake they are committing

00:55:22.581 --> 00:55:25.577
is just the other than yours.

00:55:26.376 --> 00:55:28.676
The mistake in those developing countries

00:55:28.706 --> 00:55:31.559
is that they do not believe that God Almighty

00:55:31.653 --> 00:55:34.438
is the One who is going to look after your well being.

00:55:35.152 --> 00:55:37.354
They don't believe in the power of their Father,

00:55:37.427 --> 00:55:39.588
so they do the crime against the Father or

00:55:39.597 --> 00:55:41.047
you can say the sin against the Father.

00:55:41.782 --> 00:55:44.314
When you don't believe in the capacity of your Father,

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:49.579
so there is bribery, corruption, all sorts of things going on, you know

00:55:49.844 --> 00:55:52.941
cutting corners and money and all those things go on.

00:55:54.125 --> 00:55:55.866
Still in India I would not say that

00:55:56.772 --> 00:56:00.529
ordinary people are dishonest. I mean our bureaucrats may be, our

00:56:00.751 --> 00:56:03.666
politicians may be and business people may be. But

00:56:03.781 --> 00:56:05.781
ordinary people are very honest in India.

00:56:07.798 --> 00:56:09.047
But this is what happens.

00:56:10.055 --> 00:56:12.688
On the other side, you see supposing

00:56:13.188 --> 00:56:15.589
an Indian comes to your house, be careful

00:56:16.635 --> 00:56:20.108
he may run away with anything that you have in the house, anything,

00:56:20.608 --> 00:56:22.907
see, but

00:56:23.030 --> 00:56:25.842
if an American comes to your house, be careful about your wife.

00:56:27.641 --> 00:56:30.063
He may run away with your wife or with your daughter.

00:56:31.467 --> 00:56:34.990
Or say an Englishman comes he'll do it in a subtler way

00:56:35.490 --> 00:56:36.583
because he's a scholar.

00:56:37.893 --> 00:56:40.659
So he reads some poetry to your wife

00:56:40.971 --> 00:56:42.722
and in the night you find she is missing.

00:56:46.988 --> 00:56:50.042
This is fundamental, I mean the wife

00:56:50.467 --> 00:56:52.599
who runs away like this creates problem

00:56:53.965 --> 00:56:55.965
fundamentally for the household.

00:56:56.653 --> 00:56:58.653
Just think in a house,

00:56:59.022 --> 00:57:02.989
where there are children, there is husband, kitchen

00:57:03.489 --> 00:57:06.271
and all the places, everybody sleeping nicely,

00:57:06.771 --> 00:57:08.257
early in the morning they find

00:57:08.286 --> 00:57:11.505
that the main pole of the house is missing and the whole thing is collapsed.

00:57:12.250 --> 00:57:15.595
What will happen to the children, nobody thinks.

00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:18.604
Nobody understands

00:57:19.104 --> 00:57:21.707
or they think they are being in love

00:57:22.358 --> 00:57:23.503
so they must go.

00:57:24.210 --> 00:57:27.457
Men do the same. I mean there is no difference between men and women.

00:57:29.577 --> 00:57:32.990
But this is the sin against the Mother

00:57:36.089 --> 00:57:39.453
that the women have to be respectable and respected.

00:57:41.874 --> 00:57:45.365
Housewives’ position is within us

00:57:45.413 --> 00:57:47.413
here on the left hand side, nabhi

00:57:48.666 --> 00:57:50.171
and if a housewife,

00:57:50.332 --> 00:57:52.654
the deity of housewife, is not in our house,

00:57:52.740 --> 00:57:55.027
not that the woman but the housewife,

00:57:57.335 --> 00:57:59.335
then our spleen goes out.

00:58:01.229 --> 00:58:04.606
We get, children get crazy,

00:58:05.106 --> 00:58:07.903
why is there in-disciplined. Somebody asked me today

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:12.632
what happens to the people like who try to kill Reagan?

00:58:13.149 --> 00:58:15.149
I said, ask his mother.

00:58:17.043 --> 00:58:20.126
She must be after the life of the child, morning till evening

00:58:20.626 --> 00:58:23.910
and that's why he's taking action,

00:58:24.033 --> 00:58:26.448
or is a reaction of what has happened to him.

00:58:27.664 --> 00:58:31.052
How do these complications arise

00:58:31.552 --> 00:58:33.552
has a basis in the family

00:58:34.542 --> 00:58:37.468
in the nest, that is your house.

00:58:39.437 --> 00:58:41.437
You have to live in the nest

00:58:42.427 --> 00:58:44.427
as a father and a mother

00:58:44.927 --> 00:58:46.390
looking after your children.

00:58:47.323 --> 00:58:49.970
Children are the most important things

00:58:51.091 --> 00:58:53.821
in the whole world for human beings.

00:58:57.541 --> 00:58:59.731
Let the politics go to hell,

00:58:59.817 --> 00:59:02.328
and let the economics take its own course,

00:59:02.828 --> 00:59:04.086
but children

00:59:04.812 --> 00:59:07.618
are to be looked after, that's your primary duty.

00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:11.380
But in India we go to the other end,

00:59:11.673 --> 00:59:13.901
when we start look after our children we don't mind

00:59:13.930 --> 00:59:15.930
selling our countries also in the name of children.

00:59:18.897 --> 00:59:20.897
But we live with two extremes I feel,

00:59:20.926 --> 00:59:22.604
the sin against the Mother

00:59:22.727 --> 00:59:24.727
and the sin against the Father.

00:59:27.204 --> 00:59:29.204
When we sin against the Mother

00:59:30.231 --> 00:59:32.974
as Australians, as I am now an Australian,

00:59:33.079 --> 00:59:35.079
let us face what happens to us.

00:59:39.364 --> 00:59:42.538
Absolutely we are emotionally blackmailed by ourselves.

00:59:44.142 --> 00:59:47.267
We torture ourselves, we live with artificial things.

00:59:48.407 --> 00:59:51.312
Like if a wife

00:59:51.812 --> 00:59:54.416
wants to run away with another man

00:59:55.161 --> 00:59:58.770
we will even go to get a honeymoon ticket for her

00:59:59.025 --> 01:00:01.982
because we are very considerate good husbands.

01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:06.332
Same thing with the wives if she finds that the husband

01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:08.381
is interested in another woman,

01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:10.448
she should not be jealous.

01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:16.842
In Sahaja Yoga this is not very much appreciated.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:20.465
Husband has to behave, like a husband. He should make his wife

01:00:20.532 --> 01:00:21.371
run the house.

01:00:22.022 --> 01:00:24.022
And the woman has to be a woman.

01:00:25.897 --> 01:00:27.897
She must see to it that

01:00:28.246 --> 01:00:30.246
no danger is brought to the children.

01:00:31.254 --> 01:00:34.409
We have no business to hurt anyone like this

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:36.721
and we do not know how much we hurt,

01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:39.221
we give cancers to our wives and husbands.

01:00:40.324 --> 01:00:42.324
We give all kinds of horrible diseases,

01:00:42.692 --> 01:00:45.642
mental tortures we make them mad, by our

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:48.330
mad, capricious,

01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:54.674
very shallow, understanding of our emotions.

01:00:56.812 --> 01:00:59.661
A one man starts going to another woman,

01:01:00.161 --> 01:01:01.567
then he goes to another woman,

01:01:01.747 --> 01:01:03.306
then to ten women he goes

01:01:03.392 --> 01:01:05.106
and then ten men go to ten women

01:01:05.192 --> 01:01:08.543
and end up in a lunatic asylum or

01:01:08.779 --> 01:01:12.547
in the orphanage. I have seen in England we had a neighbor

01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:16.116
who had a very huge house, he died, he was an old man

01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:17.315
and you'd be surprised

01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:20.556
they did not discover his body for one month.

01:01:20.905 --> 01:01:23.355
Because there's no family feeling, nothing,

01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:27.074
even a rat doesn't enter that house. Can you imagine!

01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:32.663
This is what has happened in thinking,

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.408
“I am separated, I am individualistic.

01:01:35.475 --> 01:01:38.602
I am exclusive”. If you are really individualistic,

01:01:39.046 --> 01:01:41.046
if you are really mature, individually,

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.339
then you know the unity much better.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:49.271
Then you understand that you are the support

01:01:50.148 --> 01:01:54.631
of the whole because you are so matured.

01:01:56.638 --> 01:01:58.638
No wonder our children are not maturing.

01:01:59.345 --> 01:02:01.345
They are behaving in such a manner.

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:05.501
We are responsible, we must accept that in our own

01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:09.913
ideas about compatibility and all this nonsense,

01:02:09.923 --> 01:02:11.711
we don’t have in India, we are quite comfortable,

01:02:11.721 --> 01:02:13.606
we are producing children quite all right.

01:02:15.085 --> 01:02:21.662
We have no problems. Why do you run after these capricious,

01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:24.444
these shallow ideas?

01:02:26.432 --> 01:02:28.432
You will be held responsible

01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:33.861
for all these horrible diseases that men and women have got,

01:02:34.361 --> 01:02:36.361
and the children that are going to suffer,

01:02:36.861 --> 01:02:41.388
if you have charity, better start it at home.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.447
Better be charitable

01:02:44.571 --> 01:02:46.947
to your own wife and to your own husband.

01:02:47.447 --> 01:02:49.926
Be charitable to your children.

01:02:50.012 --> 01:02:52.460
Don't go by concept of falling in love,

01:02:52.678 --> 01:02:54.678
you'll fall, really and make others fall too.

01:02:56.176 --> 01:02:59.293
It's a concept, just a concept.

01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:03.235
I think some of these horrible people must have given you this concept.

01:03:04.526 --> 01:03:05.996
If you really fall in love

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.082
how do you get up to marry another person?

01:03:09.147 --> 01:03:11.598
You fall, marry another person,

01:03:12.249 --> 01:03:14.249
again ready to marry another person.

01:03:14.316 --> 01:03:15.886
You are holding the hand of a person

01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:17.953
who is suppose to be your beloved or whatever it is,

01:03:17.979 --> 01:03:19.979
and looking at another one.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:24.788
This concept is absolutely wrong. You have to grow in love.

01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:29.567
As your own child is

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:32.834
in the same way is your companion. They are two parts

01:03:33.503 --> 01:03:34.641
of one chariot.

01:03:35.273 --> 01:03:37.922
One is the left and other is the right. They're not

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:40.930
unequal, they're equal

01:03:40.997 --> 01:03:44.212
but they are not similar, they have their own role.

01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:47.040
And women have to take their role courageously,

01:03:48.011 --> 01:03:50.647
to be the mother, as I always say, look at me.

01:03:51.448 --> 01:03:55.506
I am a Mother and in no way,

01:03:56.797 --> 01:03:58.797
in any way, I cannot think

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:01.128
I could be anything better than this.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.509
Now if I start thinking, Oh God,

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:08.840
I am a Mother all right, but

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340
I must know how to drive,

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:15.663
then I'm finished. I must know how to drive a bus,

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:18.370
I must know how to drive a train!

01:04:18.908 --> 01:04:20.022
What is the need?

01:04:21.351 --> 01:04:23.598
I saw one photographer who came to see me.

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.332
He was supposed to take my photograph

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.380
and whole hands were fill with blisters.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.921
I said first let me cure your blisters.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.457
How you are going to take my photograph?

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:34.660
I said what have you been doing with your, photography?

01:04:34.727 --> 01:04:37.434
No, he said, this, I went to a forest

01:04:37.633 --> 01:04:39.633
and I cut some trees. I said, for what?

01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:43.086
You are a photographer, your hands are soft and deft

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:45.792
why do you want to kill the deftness of your fingers?

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:49.222
He said, no we must do other things also. I said, why must you?

01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:52.852
You see the nose doesn’t do the work of the eyes

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.900
and the eyes do not do the work of the ears.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.730
Why must you do, your hands are all finished! And this is what it is.

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:03.047
To us we feel that men are great

01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:06.001
so we start saying, "let's do the man's work."

01:05:08.384 --> 01:05:10.914
The man thinks, why "should women be like this?"

01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:12.214
You are companions -

01:05:12.883 --> 01:05:16.376
you are eternal companions. You are two

01:05:18.383 --> 01:05:20.910
beautiful wheels of a chariot.

01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:24.201
This is to be grown

01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:25.912
and to be matured within you.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.862
And when this centre is out,

01:05:28.136 --> 01:05:31.285
you get the problems of this centre

01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:34.076
by which you get asthma, tuberculosis,

01:05:35.593 --> 01:05:37.593
and the breast troubles.

01:05:37.622 --> 01:05:41.228
Men get asthma, very serious asthma and

01:05:41.257 --> 01:05:42.934
other problems of the lungs

01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:46.515
and ultimately, also lung cancer can develop.

01:05:48.748 --> 01:05:51.087
When you work too hard with the right hand side,

01:05:51.135 --> 01:05:54.406
you are ego orientated, that is ego develops too much,

01:05:54.473 --> 01:05:56.473
then your left side is neglected,

01:05:56.502 --> 01:05:59.286
you become unemotional, that time

01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:01.409
your heart gives a signal, you get a heart attack.

01:06:02.982 --> 01:06:04.982
When you do too much sometimes

01:06:05.444 --> 01:06:07.846
you may escape the heart attack, but you may get

01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:09.247
a  brain paralysis.

01:06:13.174 --> 01:06:16.115
We are bent upon destroying ourselves.

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:19.751
The destruction is going to come from within, not from without.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.533
Those people who are try to shock you, this will happen,

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.168
that the sun is doing this, this is nothing.

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:30.184
It's all within you, the destruction has started.

01:06:30.684 --> 01:06:33.976
You are facing it because

01:06:34.476 --> 01:06:37.838
you cannot accept it.

01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.429
You have to accept

01:06:41.682 --> 01:06:43.708
that this is a challenge, I am not

01:06:43.737 --> 01:06:46.336
going to allow myself to be destroyed by foolish and stupid

01:06:46.365 --> 01:06:47.631
ideas that are around.

01:06:49.299 --> 01:06:52.097
And then in your own estimation and glory

01:06:52.597 --> 01:06:55.472
you will be surprised. After realisation

01:06:55.482 --> 01:06:57.673
you will be enriched but

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.626
without Realisation, I don't know,

01:06:59.712 --> 01:07:02.768
it becomes a lecture and a lecture, just a brainwash.

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.626
That beautiful thing should happen to you,

01:07:05.975 --> 01:07:09.472
and once you find your beauty within yourself,

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.878
overnight I have seen people changed.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.529
Overnight it happens

01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:18.388
and I hope that will happen to you tonight.

01:07:18.888 --> 01:07:22.133
Today I have talked to you about this centre

01:07:22.633 --> 01:07:25.276
and later on I will be talking to you about

01:07:25.682 --> 01:07:28.099
two other centres which are here and here.

01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:30.317
And the Realisation that takes place,

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:32.817
out of the limbic area,

01:07:33.034 --> 01:07:35.634
in the fontanel membrane,

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.491
which is called as the Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language.

01:07:38.991 --> 01:07:40.991
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:07:42.546 --> 01:07:45.086
If you have any questions you please ask me.

01:07:47.488 --> 01:07:50.351
But questions should be something

01:07:50.822 --> 01:07:52.989
which are helpful, not some sort of

01:07:53.026 --> 01:07:54.883
quarrel. I am not here to quarrel with you.

01:07:55.214 --> 01:07:57.927
If you don't want your Realisation I am not going to force you.

01:07:58.427 --> 01:08:02.766
Please do not plead for any other organisation or any other guru,

01:08:03.266 --> 01:08:06.393
because I am not interested. I am only interested in you,

01:08:06.743 --> 01:08:08.743
I see that sparkle in you,

01:08:08.816 --> 01:08:11.684
that's why I am only interested in you, I'm not bothered about others.

01:08:12.184 --> 01:08:14.636
So you do not try to bring others ideas

01:08:14.837 --> 01:08:16.663
that this guru has said this or this

01:08:16.683 --> 01:08:18.446
one has said that and this is in the book.

01:08:19.308 --> 01:08:21.910
The proof of the pudding is that you haven't got your Realisation.

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.940
If you have got it then you can go out.

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:28.609
If you are sure you have got it, I don't want to force it on you.

01:08:28.724 --> 01:08:30.445
There's no quarrel about anything.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:32.731
There's no election on, nothing.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.184
You cannot give me anything.

01:08:34.235 --> 01:08:37.299
There's no shopping. It's a temple, you have come for a blessing.

01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:40.752
All right? Now you can ask the questions. Thank you very much.
