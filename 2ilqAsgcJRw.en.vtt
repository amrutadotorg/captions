WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:02.000
It is really gratifying

00:03.000 --> 00:05.000
to come to Melbourne

00:05.679 --> 00:07.679
I came here

00:08.124 --> 00:11.602
because somebody who had come to Sydney

00:12.983 --> 00:16.896
and said that "Mother, you must come to Melbourne.

00:18.140 --> 00:19.026
We need you."

00:22.047 --> 00:24.623
When I came here for some other purpose,

00:27.196 --> 00:31.103
I felt vibrations of Melbourne

00:32.522 --> 00:33.917
are really very good,

00:35.635 --> 00:38.440
and here it is quite possible

00:38.790 --> 00:40.790
that there maybe many seekers.

00:46.012 --> 00:48.012
It is really gratifying as I said

00:48.277 --> 00:49.706
to be here among you.

00:52.856 --> 00:55.844
It's a fact that the time has come

00:56.216 --> 00:58.690
for thousands and thousands and thousands

00:58.976 --> 01:00.976
and millions of them

01:02.587 --> 01:05.103
who are born as seekers on this earth,

01:06.351 --> 01:09.425
have to get their Realisation.

01:11.699 --> 01:13.699
They have to know their meaning.

01:14.370 --> 01:16.370
They have to know why

01:17.169 --> 01:21.628
why the nature has made them a human being from amoeba.

01:22.962 --> 01:24.962
What is the purpose of their life?

01:25.783 --> 01:28.595
Unless and until you find the purpose of your life

01:28.988 --> 01:30.988
you are not going to be happy.

01:31.830 --> 01:33.830
You are not going to be satisfied.

01:33.967 --> 01:35.666
You may try anything else.

01:36.059 --> 01:38.317
You may have one of those ego trips;

01:39.116 --> 01:43.190
you may have other trips like seeking money.

01:44.673 --> 01:49.028
You may have other things like going to drugs,

01:50.319 --> 01:51.510
alcoholism,

01:52.160 --> 01:54.923
livercation, all kinds of things.

01:55.658 --> 01:58.723
But these things have not given any satisfaction,

02:00.056 --> 02:00.885
to anyone.

02:03.693 --> 02:05.693
You have to find out that Absolute,

02:06.834 --> 02:09.241
without which we are in confusion.

02:11.835 --> 02:13.835
That Absolute is within you.

02:15.681 --> 02:18.081
That's why Sahaja Yoga

02:18.837 --> 02:21.491
is as spontaneous thing, is a living thing.

02:22.354 --> 02:24.657
"Saha" means with, "Ja" means born.

02:25.157 --> 02:26.577
It is born with you,

02:27.205 --> 02:28.564
as in a seed

02:28.914 --> 02:32.240
all the maps of the seed that is going to manifest

02:33.616 --> 02:36.157
are built-in.

02:36.315 --> 02:38.315
In the same way within you,

02:40.973 --> 02:44.280
your Spirit and your Kundalini

02:44.438 --> 02:49.035
are all already existing there

02:49.578 --> 02:52.028
and they are just waiting for a chance

02:53.447 --> 02:55.618
to give you your Self-Realisation.

02:58.533 --> 03:04.388
Before telling you about the benefits of Self-Realisation,

03:06.063 --> 03:09.569
I have to tell you that you must keep your minds open

03:10.069 --> 03:14.191
as you would for any science lecture or any other lecture.

03:17.447 --> 03:19.447
There's no jugglery

03:20.567 --> 03:25.107
or there is no shopping, guru shopping in Sahaja Yoga.

03:26.547 --> 03:28.971
It is a happening, it’s an actualisation.

03:30.390 --> 03:33.108
It is within you. It’s a living force,

03:33.608 --> 03:38.348
like a flower becomes a fruit

03:39.745 --> 03:42.720
or an egg becomes a chick,

03:43.733 --> 03:47.619
you get your Realisation and you become a different personality,

03:47.628 --> 03:51.362
a new dimension of awareness grows into you

03:52.311 --> 03:55.223
and this new dimension of awareness

03:55.274 --> 03:56.695
is an actualisation,

03:57.024 --> 04:00.645
it's not just a mere words

04:01.145 --> 04:04.717
or any kind of a brainwashing.

04:05.580 --> 04:08.225
It is an actualisation within you,

04:10.178 --> 04:12.801
which happens by which

04:13.301 --> 04:15.301
you start feeling

04:15.801 --> 04:17.801
the collective consciousness.

04:18.835 --> 04:22.341
You are a part and parcel of the whole,

04:22.520 --> 04:23.655
so many have said it.

04:25.202 --> 04:26.376
We also believe in it

04:26.513 --> 04:28.753
that we are the part and parcel of the whole,

04:29.338 --> 04:31.682
but so far in our awareness,

04:32.503 --> 04:35.269
in our central nervous system, we have not felt that.

04:38.184 --> 04:40.827
So this is actually should happen to you.

04:45.088 --> 04:48.222
In this we have to accept,

04:49.192 --> 04:54.025
whatever is nourishing for our growth, after Realisation.

04:55.679 --> 04:58.082
Gradually you started accepting it

04:58.582 --> 05:00.582
and I'll tell you why it happens

05:02.214 --> 05:04.947
but the thing is in Sydney I found

05:05.447 --> 05:08.567
that people are extremely honest about their seeking

05:09.067 --> 05:11.983
and they really appreciated my honesty.

05:15.667 --> 05:17.667
This is a process

05:18.017 --> 05:20.275
which was built in since long within us.

05:21.578 --> 05:23.871
Here that you see different chakras.

05:24.371 --> 05:25.471
Are placed.

05:30.625 --> 05:33.385
Can you see? All right.

05:33.701 --> 05:37.130
These centres are placed within

05:38.889 --> 05:40.109
the human beings

05:41.886 --> 05:44.108
and they exist at subtle centers

05:45.557 --> 05:47.742
in the spinal cord and in the brain.

05:50.541 --> 05:53.970
These are called in Sanskrit language as chakras.

05:55.784 --> 05:58.523
These centres exist within us

05:59.187 --> 06:01.677
as milestones of our evolution.

06:02.615 --> 06:04.615
For example, the lowest chakra

06:05.115 --> 06:07.115
called as the Mooladdhara chakra,

06:07.615 --> 06:09.615
is the center,

06:11.447 --> 06:15.643
at that point we were carbon atoms. We were matter.

06:19.209 --> 06:22.424
At that point we were innocent. Matter is innocent.

06:24.201 --> 06:27.586
So the first thing that was created within us was innocence.

06:28.925 --> 06:31.515
This whole universe was created

06:33.037 --> 06:35.037
after innocence was created.

06:37.800 --> 06:39.800
This chakra is placed

06:40.300 --> 06:43.034
below the Kundalini, if you see it clearly.

06:43.881 --> 06:47.468
Kundalini is the pure power of desire.

06:48.315 --> 06:50.315
Pure power of desire.

06:50.815 --> 06:53.017
Whatever is pure we call it Holy.

06:53.937 --> 06:57.605
Is the Holy power of desire,

06:58.963 --> 07:00.963
which remains

07:02.850 --> 07:04.850
dormant.

07:09.365 --> 07:12.022
This power is the desire

07:12.668 --> 07:15.455
to be one with the Spirit.

07:17.141 --> 07:20.238
Without knowing the Spirit, you cannot know God.

07:22.125 --> 07:24.346
You are to be input to the mains.

07:25.704 --> 07:27.229
You are not yet put to the mains.

07:27.273 --> 07:29.437
For example, this instrument that we have made

07:30.247 --> 07:32.876
if it is not put to the mains, it has no meaning.

07:34.288 --> 07:36.288
So that has to happen.

07:36.788 --> 07:38.788
It's like the primule in the seed,

07:38.905 --> 07:40.905
a germinating power

07:41.715 --> 07:42.473
in the seed,

07:42.864 --> 07:46.087
that you have got this power, residual power

07:47.080 --> 07:47.899
sleeping

07:48.581 --> 07:50.581
waiting for a moment

07:50.844 --> 07:52.246
when somebody

07:52.746 --> 07:55.259
who is authorised by the Divine

07:55.412 --> 07:56.354
and not

07:56.653 --> 07:59.164
by any organization or certificates

08:00.449 --> 08:01.869
that human beings give.

08:02.844 --> 08:05.618
But somebody, who himself is a Realised soul,

08:05.954 --> 08:07.954
as an enlightened person

08:08.454 --> 08:09.454
and he knows

08:11.304 --> 08:13.652
what is this power is,

08:16.506 --> 08:18.506
it waits for such a personality

08:19.900 --> 08:21.900
and then it awakens itself

08:22.035 --> 08:24.035
and you get your Self-Realisation.

08:27.820 --> 08:29.820
It has to be spontaneous

08:29.919 --> 08:34.132
everything vital in life has to be spontaneous.

08:36.128 --> 08:39.345
The breathing that we have

08:40.575 --> 08:43.609
is so spontaneously going on

08:44.109 --> 08:48.196
that we take it for granted till it stops, or till we feel

08:49.718 --> 08:51.051
that we cannot breathe.

08:53.157 --> 08:55.157
If you have to go and read books,

08:55.274 --> 08:58.881
or putting some efforts to breathe,

08:59.381 --> 09:03.598
then how many of us could

09:04.098 --> 09:06.616
even exist for more than

09:07.481 --> 09:09.481
say five minutes?

09:11.404 --> 09:13.404
It is so vital

09:13.776 --> 09:16.256
is the culmination of our evolution

09:17.833 --> 09:22.296
and as the whole creation was created by the Divine,

09:23.453 --> 09:26.509
as you are also created by the Divine,

09:27.155 --> 09:31.428
this great happening is to be done by the Divine.

09:35.213 --> 09:37.213
Now some people asked me

09:37.286 --> 09:40.433
that can it not happen by itself to us.

09:41.424 --> 09:46.198
We do not know that at every stage of our evolution

09:47.104 --> 09:50.167
some aspect of God had to incarnate

09:50.795 --> 09:53.893
or some guidance had to come from the Divine,

09:55.782 --> 09:59.824
to give us a higher awareness.

10:01.350 --> 10:03.350
But specially at this time

10:03.700 --> 10:05.080
it is very important

10:05.409 --> 10:07.409
that somebody has to do it

10:07.909 --> 10:11.130
because you have reached a stage where,

10:12.314 --> 10:15.984
you have to know it in words,

10:16.762 --> 10:19.045
and Divine had to speak.

10:22.301 --> 10:26.456
It's a very common question that in,

10:26.465 --> 10:28.465
I think people are ego orientated,

10:28.901 --> 10:31.574
they said, "Why you Mother?" I said you better be there!

10:32.245 --> 10:35.043
I’ll be very happy if you could do it

10:35.778 --> 10:39.180
because I am a happily married woman,

10:39.894 --> 10:41.894
I don't need anything from anyone,

10:42.394 --> 10:44.394
I have to just give

10:44.894 --> 10:50.447
but if you can do my work, I will be very happy to retire.

10:52.699 --> 10:55.744
It's very easy to say, "why you?" I mean you should ask

10:55.757 --> 10:58.271
God why He gave me these powers?

10:59.160 --> 11:01.160
But they are there,

11:01.392 --> 11:05.331
but one need not feel hurt about it so much also.

11:05.539 --> 11:08.282
After all you have some many powers which I don't have.

11:08.782 --> 11:10.782
For example, I don't know how to drive,

11:11.282 --> 11:12.364
really I don't know.

11:12.669 --> 11:13.870
I don’t know many things,

11:13.932 --> 11:16.626
even I don't know how to open ordinary cans

11:17.248 --> 11:19.965
but if I know how to open the Kundalini

11:20.684 --> 11:22.684
why should it hurt your ego?

11:23.574 --> 11:25.574
And why should you feel bad

11:25.733 --> 11:28.485
because I have to really work day in day out.

11:30.396 --> 11:32.396
To do this work,

11:33.529 --> 11:35.529
it’s something just a gift to you.

11:35.810 --> 11:37.810
There is no shopping;

11:38.091 --> 11:40.091
you can't pay for it.

11:40.372 --> 11:41.831
It is beyond,

11:42.818 --> 11:44.818
your control.

11:45.318 --> 11:50.459
To conceive God, you have to see, as the reality is.

11:51.616 --> 11:53.640
You have to give up your conceptions.

11:53.702 --> 11:56.819
Supposing I had conceived a hall

11:57.319 --> 11:59.319
before seeing this,

11:59.478 --> 12:01.478
I would have had funny ideas

12:02.197 --> 12:03.642
but after seeing it

12:03.680 --> 12:06.570
only I really know what it is.

12:07.386 --> 12:08.559
In the same way

12:09.059 --> 12:10.363
people have written books,

12:11.033 --> 12:13.033
thousands of books they have written

12:13.533 --> 12:16.163
or even millions of books they have written, so what to do?

12:17.223 --> 12:18.544
If they have written the books,

12:18.582 --> 12:21.309
have they given you any Self-Realisation?

12:23.852 --> 12:26.445
Have they given you that experience

12:26.945 --> 12:29.490
of the absolute by which you know yourself,

12:29.990 --> 12:32.985
you know your centres and you know the centre of others

12:33.485 --> 12:36.217
and you start manifesting your own powers.

12:37.739 --> 12:39.911
You become the master of your powers.

12:42.698 --> 12:47.110
This is what should be the criteria of your seeking.

12:48.437 --> 12:52.825
Why should you be identified with anything else but yourself?

12:54.225 --> 12:55.633
Because I get people

12:55.865 --> 12:57.940
belonging to this cult or this group

12:58.002 --> 13:00.002
or this religion or this and that.

13:02.910 --> 13:05.184
But you must understand

13:05.684 --> 13:07.684
that you are not here

13:07.916 --> 13:09.916
to be pleader for any one of them.

13:10.684 --> 13:13.102
I mean you pay them to be their pleader

13:14.794 --> 13:18.411
or to be their lawyers or solicitors, whatever you may call it.

13:21.003 --> 13:24.442
But you should really try to honestly seek the truth

13:24.942 --> 13:26.653
and ask for this truth

13:27.028 --> 13:29.028
and then only you will get the truth.

13:30.720 --> 13:32.720
So first thing one should understand

13:32.952 --> 13:34.952
that you cannot purchase Divine.

13:35.671 --> 13:38.058
You cannot pay for it, it is an insult,

13:39.580 --> 13:40.796
it is an insult.

13:42.877 --> 13:46.048
And secondly you cannot put in effort for that.

13:46.889 --> 13:48.352
When you have to sprout a seed

13:48.365 --> 13:50.365
what do you do? You put it in the Mother Earth,

13:50.914 --> 13:53.381
and she sprouts by itself spontaneously.

13:54.100 --> 13:55.598
It has got that force in it,

13:55.660 --> 13:57.859
only you have to put it to the Mother Earth.

13:58.967 --> 14:01.410
And the Mother Earth by her warmth

14:01.910 --> 14:03.910
germinates the seed.

14:04.994 --> 14:07.240
Do you get angry with the Mother Earth for that,

14:07.278 --> 14:08.885
that, why must you do that?

14:11.137 --> 14:13.357
If she has to do it, she has to do it.

14:13.857 --> 14:16.077
Whatever the sun has to do has to do,

14:16.577 --> 14:18.577
and whatever you have to do, you can do

14:18.907 --> 14:20.907
and whatever the animals have to do, they do.

14:24.326 --> 14:25.676
If we understand that

14:25.714 --> 14:28.282
we have not yet achieved what we wanted to,

14:31.969 --> 14:33.969
then you will realise

14:34.761 --> 14:36.761
that there is a very little gap.

14:38.453 --> 14:40.453
The Kundalini awakening takes

14:41.342 --> 14:42.981
split of a second,

14:44.162 --> 14:49.467
but its rising may take more time in certain people

14:50.575 --> 14:55.131
because of blockages in the centre

14:55.972 --> 14:59.432
or maybe some imbalances within us.

15:01.708 --> 15:04.303
In short I will try to tell you

15:04.730 --> 15:07.286
what is the Kundalini and what is this picture about.

15:09.002 --> 15:11.002
I hope you have got some books with you,

15:11.161 --> 15:13.546
you can also open and see for yourself.

15:14.046 --> 15:17.562
Those who haven't got books can also get from them,

15:18.767 --> 15:22.181
it will be easier to understand it.

15:24.554 --> 15:28.237
At the back of the book you will find a nice chart.

15:40.146 --> 15:42.849
Firstly you have to be honest about your seeking,

15:44.054 --> 15:47.271
absolutely honest about it then everything will work out.

15:50.666 --> 15:54.064
Now here you see this chart

15:54.564 --> 15:56.564
is the first center

15:57.064 --> 15:59.209
called as the Mooladhara chakra, as I said,

16:00.585 --> 16:01.691
and the sacrum.

16:02.556 --> 16:04.847
See the meaning of the word sacrum means sacred.

16:06.077 --> 16:09.224
Sacrum is the bone in which the Kundalini is there.

16:11.865 --> 16:14.282
I would like you to see from the top

16:15.877 --> 16:19.512
this blue color balloon like structure

16:19.866 --> 16:21.866
comes down up to the first chakra.

16:26.672 --> 16:27.728
Now this,

16:32.899 --> 16:36.686
represents a subtle force within us,

16:38.743 --> 16:41.226
which is the power of desire.

16:43.623 --> 16:45.623
It manifests outside

16:46.123 --> 16:48.123
the left sympathetic nervous system.

16:50.496 --> 16:53.012
This is the emotional side of a human being.

16:53.512 --> 16:54.841
It is not only emotional.

16:59.112 --> 17:02.323
This is the one that

17:02.823 --> 17:04.823
takes conditionings

17:07.293 --> 17:08.411
within itself

17:08.473 --> 17:11.495
when we say "Don't do that, don't do that, don't do that"

17:16.009 --> 17:19.259
and creates by its activity

17:20.148 --> 17:24.107
a balloon like structure called as superego

17:24.607 --> 17:26.607
which is in Sanskrit called as mana.

17:28.275 --> 17:33.007
So this is the power of mana, of manashakti.

17:33.430 --> 17:35.101
English language is a little

17:35.236 --> 17:37.236
confused, when you say mental cases

17:37.468 --> 17:40.014
you do not mean, the mental cases

17:40.149 --> 17:42.597
that has something to do with the

17:42.756 --> 17:44.357
mind which thinks.

17:44.857 --> 17:46.471
But when you say mental cases,

17:46.776 --> 17:50.060
you mean to say that they are the people who suffer

17:50.292 --> 17:52.292
from emotional problems.

17:53.741 --> 17:55.175
It's a little confused thing

17:55.894 --> 17:57.894
but in psychology

17:58.954 --> 18:01.274
it is very nicely described by Jung,

18:01.360 --> 18:03.065
who was a realised soul himself,

18:03.760 --> 18:05.238
the superego

18:06.857 --> 18:09.202
and the ID part is this

18:11.089 --> 18:13.430
power by which we

18:15.414 --> 18:17.972
get all our conditionings within us

18:18.326 --> 18:20.326
and we pass it to our past.

18:20.996 --> 18:23.317
Beyond this area on the left-hand side

18:24.206 --> 18:26.206
lies beyond the subconscious,

18:27.120 --> 18:30.085
the collective sub-conscious, all that is dead,

18:31.047 --> 18:34.580
since creation lies this side on the left-hand side.

18:35.486 --> 18:37.786
This manifests as I told you,

18:38.286 --> 18:40.286
the left sympathetic nervous system.

18:40.786 --> 18:42.407
Now in the medical science,

18:42.907 --> 18:46.100
there is no difference between the left and right.

18:46.899 --> 18:48.153
But you will find out

18:48.247 --> 18:51.752
they have entirely two different functions.

18:52.957 --> 18:55.543
The left sympathetic nervous caters

18:55.808 --> 19:00.039
to our emotional side which can be proved in Sahaja Yoga practice.

19:02.441 --> 19:05.166
Now on the right hand side,

19:06.264 --> 19:07.725
there is another power

19:08.353 --> 19:10.353
which is the power of action.

19:11.494 --> 19:15.660
When we desire, the desire has to be put into action.

19:16.886 --> 19:19.605
And this power of desire

19:20.874 --> 19:23.233
is called the prana Shakti,

19:24.075 --> 19:26.314
or the power of action

19:27.241 --> 19:29.241
the kriya Shakti, some people call it

19:29.869 --> 19:31.869
and it looks after

19:32.369 --> 19:34.369
our intellectual side,

19:34.869 --> 19:36.869
our intelligence

19:37.134 --> 19:40.535
and the mind with which we think about the mental side

19:41.633 --> 19:43.633
and our physical side,

19:44.133 --> 19:46.133
through which we go into action.

19:51.954 --> 19:55.258
This as a result of it’s activity creates

19:55.288 --> 19:57.416
another balloon you can see there,

19:57.446 --> 19:58.971
a yellow color balloon

19:59.321 --> 20:02.004
which we call as ego.

20:02.504 --> 20:04.504
EGO, ego.

20:05.410 --> 20:10.141
And this two powers meet at a point,

20:10.876 --> 20:12.876
when a child is about say

20:13.376 --> 20:16.416
12 years of age, he is completely

20:16.916 --> 20:18.174
calcified here.

20:18.674 --> 20:20.310
But in childhood only you see at

20:20.340 --> 20:22.769
the age of say one year or one and the half year,

20:22.906 --> 20:25.524
you start feeling the calcification,

20:25.682 --> 20:28.354
of this soft bone called as fontanel bone.

20:29.858 --> 20:32.939
In the center is the third power,

20:37.264 --> 20:42.101
called as the power of evolution.

20:43.733 --> 20:46.716
The power of sustenance.

20:48.092 --> 20:50.285
The power of religion

20:50.486 --> 20:51.930
which is innate within us.

20:52.430 --> 20:54.430
Now "religo" means a

20:56.404 --> 20:58.404
capacity, you can say a quality

21:00.143 --> 21:00.809
like

21:03.040 --> 21:04.590
gold is untarnishable,

21:04.983 --> 21:06.284
that is the quality of gold.

21:06.549 --> 21:08.549
Carbon has four valencies

21:08.750 --> 21:10.188
that is the quality of carbon.

21:10.688 --> 21:11.793
In the same way,

21:11.866 --> 21:15.009
human beings also have got ten sustenance

21:15.787 --> 21:18.198
and these ten sustenance are

21:18.698 --> 21:19.603
the dharma

21:20.338 --> 21:22.489
or the religions of a human being.

21:22.989 --> 21:26.131
It has nothing to do with outside religions, whatever you believe into

21:26.182 --> 21:29.016
or whatever you have fallen into or you are born into.

21:29.601 --> 21:32.078
But there are ten sustanances within us,

21:32.792 --> 21:34.920
which are in this area,

21:35.420 --> 21:39.826
call as, we call it as Void, but it's not the same void as Zen says,

21:40.903 --> 21:43.608
but is the visceral cavity

21:45.283 --> 21:46.410
in this area,

21:48.513 --> 21:51.823
we develop our sustenance.

21:54.716 --> 21:58.137
By developing our sustanance only we evolve.

21:58.530 --> 22:00.617
For example, first a fish

22:01.694 --> 22:04.574
came out of the water

22:06.527 --> 22:10.023
and developed a sustenance by it started crawling

22:10.074 --> 22:12.074
and it became a reptile.

22:12.574 --> 22:15.168
Firstly only one fish came

22:16.031 --> 22:17.069
and then

22:17.996 --> 22:20.546
shoals and shoals of fishes started

22:22.050 --> 22:23.237
coming out of the water.

22:23.844 --> 22:24.705
So

22:26.444 --> 22:30.550
the evolution went on like this till we became human beings.

22:31.328 --> 22:32.643
In this process,

22:33.464 --> 22:34.865
as you know very well

22:36.391 --> 22:38.910
the left sided and the right sided animals,

22:38.940 --> 22:42.106
the right sided are the more ambitious, the dominating type.

22:42.200 --> 22:44.200
The left sided are the sly.

22:44.549 --> 22:46.700
As you have many nocturnal animals

22:47.115 --> 22:48.051
they are all left sided,

22:49.491 --> 22:51.491
they're frightened and live in the left

22:52.098 --> 22:54.674
and those who are aggressive are on the right hand side.

22:55.815 --> 22:58.974
They were discarded even some vegetables and what you

22:59.025 --> 23:03.313
call the plants were discarded in the process of evolution.

23:04.625 --> 23:06.837
And they were thrown on the right and left side.

23:08.491 --> 23:13.234
And God created man in His own image.

23:14.781 --> 23:15.561
That means

23:18.027 --> 23:19.068
man has

23:21.220 --> 23:23.018
everything that God has.

23:23.518 --> 23:25.518
If He is the primordial being,

23:25.612 --> 23:28.547
He is the macrocosm then you are the microcosm,

23:29.132 --> 23:31.132
you are a cell in His body

23:32.764 --> 23:34.764
but you are not aware of that.

23:35.264 --> 23:38.223
There's a difference between awareness

23:38.723 --> 23:40.723
and just consciousness.

23:41.031 --> 23:43.698
Awareness is an actualization,

23:45.245 --> 23:46.638
while just to be conscious

23:46.689 --> 23:50.032
means mentally you believe, rationally you are a conscious, I know that,

23:50.853 --> 23:52.874
we think we are brothers and sisters.

23:56.323 --> 23:58.323
Now the centres that are

24:00.148 --> 24:02.536
placed within. The first one, as I told you,

24:03.036 --> 24:06.035
is the Mooladhara chakra.

24:07.881 --> 24:10.268
You will be happy to know that

24:10.768 --> 24:13.740
in the universe Australia is the Mooladhara chakra.

24:20.350 --> 24:22.760
It's a fact you will know that

24:23.666 --> 24:26.586
on vibrations if you ask a question you will know.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.918
Basically you are innocent people.

24:34.076 --> 24:37.070
You don't know also when you commit sins that this is sin,

24:37.143 --> 24:39.143
you just do it very innocently.

24:40.626 --> 24:43.652
You don't do it knowingly, innocently you do it.

24:46.973 --> 24:50.640
And the center second center,

24:51.429 --> 24:54.147
is the center called as Swadisthana chakra.

24:56.109 --> 24:59.182
The first center manifests your pelvic plexus.

25:05.545 --> 25:09.411
The right side, as I told you manifests the right sympathetic nervous system.

25:11.212 --> 25:13.568
The centre one manifests your

25:13.891 --> 25:17.172
parasympathetic which is broken, which is not yet complete.

25:19.246 --> 25:20.566
Whatever you have achieved

25:20.600 --> 25:22.908
in your awareness as a human being

25:23.055 --> 25:25.055
is there and there is little gap,

25:26.551 --> 25:27.928
where you have to just

25:28.990 --> 25:31.791
break through into that, and become

25:32.146 --> 25:34.653
united with that force.

25:38.044 --> 25:40.550
Now this second chakra

25:41.050 --> 25:43.656
is the chakra called as Swadisthana chakra,

25:44.702 --> 25:46.237
you need not worry about the names,

25:46.737 --> 25:49.931
but is the centre for action,

25:50.913 --> 25:54.181
by which you think, think for the future.

25:54.938 --> 25:57.670
And this center looks after

25:58.572 --> 25:59.549
many other

26:02.892 --> 26:05.038
visras or you can say organs within us.

26:06.261 --> 26:07.698
It looks after your liver.

26:08.824 --> 26:11.801
All attention is looked after by this centre.

26:12.751 --> 26:15.571
Liver, then it looks after

26:16.200 --> 26:18.589
your pancreas, your spleen,

26:19.089 --> 26:20.046
your kidneys

26:21.349 --> 26:23.868
and uterus in the women.

26:26.697 --> 26:28.778
The most important function of

26:28.828 --> 26:31.720
this centre is to manifest the aortic plexus,

26:33.585 --> 26:36.979
in the gross and to convert

26:38.154 --> 26:40.154
the fat cells of the stomach

26:41.393 --> 26:43.703
to replace the fat cells of the brain

26:45.263 --> 26:47.263
because after all the fat cells

26:48.582 --> 26:52.785
of the brain are to be replaced because you think, think, think, think

26:52.819 --> 26:54.297
and go mad with thinking.

26:55.070 --> 26:56.394
You think so much

26:56.782 --> 26:58.590
that as if two horns

26:58.688 --> 27:00.142
are coming out of your thinking.

27:02.521 --> 27:04.985
You may say the other day that "Mother,

27:05.405 --> 27:08.018
mind is very important because

27:08.437 --> 27:09.788
mind is the problem."

27:12.521 --> 27:15.002
Don't you know that this mind is limited?

27:15.663 --> 27:17.359
This rationality is limited.

27:18.196 --> 27:19.890
You have to go to unlimited.

27:20.727 --> 27:22.918
When I have to come to this hall,

27:23.000 --> 27:24.559
we had to leave the car outside.

27:26.119 --> 27:28.869
This mind can go up to a point and if you

27:28.919 --> 27:30.373
try to go beyond that,

27:30.616 --> 27:32.616
then you really go crazy.

27:34.224 --> 27:36.224
We don't bring the cars inside,

27:37.961 --> 27:39.961
in the same way this mind

27:40.349 --> 27:42.478
cannot take you to the unlimited.

27:43.540 --> 27:46.585
It’s a limited thing, you have to go beyond the mind.

27:51.422 --> 27:54.734
This centre is doing this work

27:54.961 --> 27:58.733
of supplying the fat cells and when you think too much,

27:59.329 --> 28:03.477
all other visaras or all other organs are

28:05.326 --> 28:08.489
not looked after, are neglected by which

28:09.840 --> 28:14.687
the person who thinks too much

28:15.508 --> 28:18.110
who lives in the future, who plans too much,

28:19.686 --> 28:23.443
also then drinks, in addition to that, supposing,

28:24.457 --> 28:26.024
and in addition to that

28:26.765 --> 28:28.541
he does other things like

28:28.575 --> 28:31.266
drug taking in the stomach and eats lots of fat food

28:31.284 --> 28:34.276
and all that, so he really finishes that poor liver.

28:36.639 --> 28:39.461
And that liver is the one that sorts out

28:39.961 --> 28:42.946
all your poisons in the body, all kinds of poison.

28:44.570 --> 28:48.193
But this liver gets out of order

28:48.564 --> 28:51.585
and you don't feel it, only the heat starts accumulating,

28:52.438 --> 28:54.261
you feel always nauseating

28:54.311 --> 28:57.628
and you feel so unhappy, you don't want to face the present,

28:57.823 --> 28:58.982
you want to run away.

28:59.193 --> 29:01.193
You feel extremely horrid

29:01.532 --> 29:03.532
you don't know what to do with yourself.

29:03.598 --> 29:05.598
All that comes from a bad liver.

29:08.636 --> 29:11.182
Also apart from liver

29:12.132 --> 29:12.870
your

29:15.105 --> 29:16.428
pancreas goes

29:16.928 --> 29:19.802
out and you develop a disease called diabetes.

29:21.250 --> 29:24.402
With that you also try some coffee and all those things,

29:25.095 --> 29:25.769
which add up.

29:26.269 --> 29:28.269
I mean coffee, the amount of coffee

29:28.299 --> 29:30.769
people consumes, sometimes I can't understand.

29:32.522 --> 29:36.031
And that coffee can really spoil the pancreas

29:36.189 --> 29:37.163
to such an extent

29:38.160 --> 29:39.447
that you can develop

29:40.118 --> 29:42.627
even more serious diseases

29:42.816 --> 29:44.816
than diabetes of the pancreas.

29:45.316 --> 29:48.538
Beyond the pancreas lies the spleen.

29:49.675 --> 29:53.351
Spleen is the real victim of modern people,

29:53.851 --> 29:56.531
real victim is poor spleen.

29:57.264 --> 30:01.202
Spleen is the one which is the speedometer within us,

30:01.702 --> 30:03.702
it regulates your speed.

30:05.647 --> 30:08.268
When you are eating your food,

30:09.156 --> 30:10.830
you suddenly open the news

30:11.330 --> 30:13.926
on the TV or something, horrible things happen.

30:14.426 --> 30:17.003
You get so shocked and emergencies built-in,

30:17.503 --> 30:20.702
the spleen is already the busy producing RBC’s,

30:20.845 --> 30:24.184
red corpuscles for the digestion of the food,

30:25.430 --> 30:27.655
and suddenly it has another emergency, and

30:27.689 --> 30:30.174
a third emergency. The way we take our breakfast,

30:31.094 --> 30:33.768
half sandwich in the mouth and half

30:34.999 --> 30:35.995
outside

30:36.386 --> 30:40.012
stepping into the car, telling your wife that do this, do that

30:40.512 --> 30:43.966
and then rush through the rat race,

30:44.590 --> 30:45.998
ending up yourself

30:46.498 --> 30:50.428
into a very crazy spleen.

30:50.617 --> 30:52.255
The spleen does not know

30:53.346 --> 30:56.242
how to carry on with your telescopic behavior

30:57.162 --> 30:59.162
and it go so very crazy

30:59.662 --> 31:03.004
that it starts producing crazy cells

31:03.504 --> 31:05.504
and these are the crazy cells

31:06.004 --> 31:07.879
which create ultimately

31:07.975 --> 31:10.756
a very serious disease called blood cancer.

31:13.059 --> 31:14.986
The other day somebody asked me a question,

31:14.995 --> 31:17.672
"Mother, how the children get blood cancer?"

31:18.749 --> 31:21.355
I said if I tell you you shouldn’t be angry with me,

31:21.855 --> 31:24.668
but when we are after the life of our children,

31:24.741 --> 31:26.439
poor things, they are small children.

31:27.067 --> 31:29.457
We are trying to make them good citizens.

31:54.850 --> 31:58.142
So this crazy spleen, becomes

31:59.860 --> 32:01.860
absolutely uncontrollable

32:02.360 --> 32:05.768
it start producing blood cells

32:06.118 --> 32:09.765
which become malignant. They go at random,

32:10.051 --> 32:13.290
any time and the malignancy starts

32:13.619 --> 32:15.619
where one cell becomes very big,

32:15.969 --> 32:18.968
unique as we are also malignant people sometimes.

32:19.254 --> 32:21.537
You want to be unique people in the society,

32:21.716 --> 32:24.303
engulfing everybody, encroaching on other people,

32:24.331 --> 32:27.466
in this competition we want to have everything to ourselves,

32:28.051 --> 32:29.339
and by the time

32:30.715 --> 32:33.477
you are old, you find your hands are shaking,

32:33.509 --> 32:35.977
feet are shaking, you can't walk properly

32:36.263 --> 32:38.761
or you develop diseases like say,

32:39.560 --> 32:41.560
heart attack, or a stroke.

32:44.453 --> 32:47.769
This rat race is

32:48.675 --> 32:51.480
very competitive. Competition for what?

32:53.646 --> 32:55.951
Everybody should be able to grow

32:56.750 --> 32:58.750
in relation to others.

32:59.250 --> 33:02.406
For example, if your nose only starts growing like that,

33:03.269 --> 33:05.547
not in relation to your body or face,

33:05.556 --> 33:07.556
what is going to happen to the rest of it?

33:09.851 --> 33:12.303
To be on your own, I’m on my own,

33:15.025 --> 33:17.025
and then you start growing

33:17.354 --> 33:20.505
without any relationship or co-ordination with the other

33:20.535 --> 33:22.172
parts of the society,

33:22.672 --> 33:24.434
other parts of the world,

33:25.725 --> 33:27.123
then you become malignant.

33:28.478 --> 33:32.085
You lose all balance, you don't know what you are doing.

33:36.239 --> 33:38.239
This is the tragedy

33:38.739 --> 33:41.080
that when this happens to us

33:41.580 --> 33:43.211
we are so ego-orientated

33:43.711 --> 33:45.472
that the pangs are not felt

33:45.780 --> 33:48.314
till you reach a stage, that suddenly you find

33:48.472 --> 33:51.729
a person goes they you call it in English - "ga-ga",

33:52.229 --> 33:54.229
American English.

33:56.844 --> 33:59.695
You find them, they can't talk, I have seen it

34:00.772 --> 34:02.772
in Paris. Some people,

34:02.909 --> 34:04.909
not very old, younger to me in age,

34:05.409 --> 34:07.409
walk into a bus

34:07.546 --> 34:09.080
and they are talking loudly,

34:09.366 --> 34:11.366
all sorts of French words

34:11.866 --> 34:13.866
and I asked what are they doing?

34:14.366 --> 34:17.445
They said, "Mother they are talking about last war. I said why?

34:17.945 --> 34:20.354
They said they just go on talking like this, they're gone.

34:20.854 --> 34:24.253
They are, what did you say, out of the deck.

34:28.514 --> 34:32.176
Because you are having such a running jump towards the hell,

34:33.808 --> 34:36.730
that the progress, so called,

34:38.118 --> 34:42.704
will make our society into very funny people

34:43.095 --> 34:45.204
who are jittery,

34:46.700 --> 34:49.376
who are twitching their heads, necks and everything

34:50.148 --> 34:54.045
and their children are so aggressive,

34:55.578 --> 34:59.959
that it is impossible to understand why they're behaving like this.

35:05.767 --> 35:07.099
We have to understand

35:07.599 --> 35:10.322
that we are part and parcel of the whole.

35:12.108 --> 35:14.108
And anything that is done

35:14.536 --> 35:16.608
without the relationship of other

35:17.869 --> 35:18.869
can create

35:20.836 --> 35:25.063
tremendous problems for the whole world as it is and it is creating.

35:28.969 --> 35:31.901
The second centre is very important

35:31.930 --> 35:33.930
for modern people as I told you,

35:35.771 --> 35:38.656
because when you start thinking too much also,

35:39.029 --> 35:41.029
what you do is use your right side,

35:42.163 --> 35:44.163
and the left side gets frozen.

35:45.333 --> 35:46.466
By improving

35:47.636 --> 35:49.636
on your thinking processes,

35:49.937 --> 35:51.938
thinking too much of the future and

35:51.949 --> 35:54.438
planning and of course most of the plans go waste.

35:55.246 --> 35:57.924
Such a lost of energy we waste in thinking

35:58.949 --> 36:02.886
that we find that if we had not thought so much,

36:03.006 --> 36:05.006
we would not have been that much frustrated.

36:07.064 --> 36:10.156
The planning also to such an extent

36:10.656 --> 36:11.855
doesn't help in any way.

36:12.754 --> 36:14.754
Supposing I have to come to this hall

36:14.946 --> 36:16.346
and I do not know the way.

36:16.846 --> 36:18.411
What planning can I have?

36:18.929 --> 36:21.193
I have just to ask somebody how do you go there

36:21.331 --> 36:22.932
and face as it is.

36:23.722 --> 36:27.490
Supposing a seed has to grow into a root -

36:28.117 --> 36:30.117
does it have any planning before hand?

36:30.708 --> 36:33.861
It does not. What it does is that it faces.

36:34.035 --> 36:36.035
It's a little cell, and so wise,

36:36.318 --> 36:38.755
and it knows that there is an obstruction, no use

36:38.784 --> 36:40.656
fighting with this rock,

36:41.156 --> 36:42.466
so it goes around,

36:42.821 --> 36:45.957
all soft places it pierces

36:46.457 --> 36:49.693
and gets itself embedded sensibly and wisely

36:49.758 --> 36:51.152
and uses that rock,

36:51.453 --> 36:54.995
uses that rock for the strengthening of the tree.

36:57.198 --> 36:59.924
So when we try to dominate others,

37:00.424 --> 37:04.679
I mean the sophisticated, the more sophisticated you get,

37:05.179 --> 37:08.888
the more sophisticated this ego gets

37:10.113 --> 37:13.809
and with that sophistication you are very pleased, sorry,

37:14.363 --> 37:17.347
yes and all those things are there,

37:17.611 --> 37:20.540
but inside a big Mr. ego is developing,

37:21.348 --> 37:24.226
like a balloon. And it presses down

37:25.088 --> 37:26.761
your superego,

37:29.054 --> 37:30.676
and it comes down.

37:31.466 --> 37:33.791
Now the gap that is between the two

37:33.947 --> 37:35.984
or the place where it should be is not there

37:37.027 --> 37:39.371
and ego presses down the superego,

37:39.871 --> 37:42.753
till superego starts seeing

37:44.811 --> 37:46.176
the colossal ego.

37:47.654 --> 37:51.381
And then such a person takes to escapes,

37:51.790 --> 37:53.247
it takes to alcohol,

37:53.403 --> 37:55.403
which gives rise to superego

37:56.048 --> 37:58.048
or it takes to drugs

37:58.947 --> 38:00.947
and all kinds of escapes in life

38:01.429 --> 38:04.344
to run away from his own ego because he can't bear it.

38:06.474 --> 38:08.744
Now the wobbling starts,

38:09.769 --> 38:11.769
the ego and superego starts wobbling

38:12.160 --> 38:16.678
and that's how you get people who are absolutely confused.

38:19.859 --> 38:22.588
Moreover, to add up to the whole problem

38:25.334 --> 38:27.892
the modern times are the ones

38:29.570 --> 38:31.079
that in this confusion,

38:32.920 --> 38:35.526
last judgment has already started.

38:36.968 --> 38:39.202
Through your Kundalini awakening only

38:39.358 --> 38:41.358
you will judge yourself

38:41.858 --> 38:43.100
and correct yourself

38:44.035 --> 38:46.378
and you will enter into the kingdom of God.

38:49.088 --> 38:51.286
These confusions

38:53.163 --> 38:57.671
actually have led human beings to such frantic

38:58.225 --> 39:00.225
precarious ages

39:00.725 --> 39:02.725
that Sahaja Yoga

39:03.225 --> 39:04.784
had to come on this earth,

39:06.009 --> 39:09.076
to solve the problems once for all.

39:10.681 --> 39:12.389
After getting Realisation,

39:12.436 --> 39:14.941
it's so remarkable when you find your absolute

39:15.006 --> 39:17.006
through Kundalini awakening

39:17.506 --> 39:20.635
I have seen people overnight they give up so many things.

39:21.135 --> 39:23.135
Like I know of an old man,

39:24.722 --> 39:26.866
very old man, in Singapore

39:26.931 --> 39:29.131
who is very well known, very rich man

39:29.196 --> 39:31.196
and a very well known personality,

39:33.707 --> 39:36.147
and he got his Realisation

39:36.248 --> 39:38.705
and he told me that overnight,

39:38.825 --> 39:40.516
"I gave up my gambling,

39:40.762 --> 39:42.485
I gave up my drinking

39:42.858 --> 39:45.370
and I gave up my racing".

39:47.374 --> 39:49.374
These are also escapes in life,

39:49.620 --> 39:51.620
these are all escapes

39:52.718 --> 39:54.718
because we are so bored of ourselves.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.509
Imagine a person is imprisoned.

39:58.153 --> 40:00.428
If he is just imprisoned in a nice place,

40:00.475 --> 40:02.805
he should not feel upset. After all

40:02.852 --> 40:04.554
it's a very good thing to face yourself,

40:04.565 --> 40:06.565
that's the most beautiful thing we have.

40:08.043 --> 40:11.056
But because we are so frightened of ourselves only,

40:11.556 --> 40:14.373
that we don't want to be left alone, we think that we are lonely.

40:16.105 --> 40:18.105
We want to run away from ourselves.

40:19.004 --> 40:20.385
We want to have somebody else is

40:20.414 --> 40:23.313
better to have somebody else, and even when somebody else comes in,

40:23.433 --> 40:25.433
we do not want to face him squarely

40:26.205 --> 40:28.205
but we want to have something in between,

40:28.306 --> 40:30.306
like a bottle of beer or something.

40:33.070 --> 40:36.708
After Realisation you first time start enjoying each other.

40:37.661 --> 40:40.783
You first time start feeling the vibrations on another person

40:41.283 --> 40:44.501
and you really enjoy the beauty of another person's

40:44.838 --> 40:47.038
through this cool breeze that is coming

40:47.158 --> 40:49.158
out of the being of that person.

40:50.999 --> 40:52.999
And this should happen to all of you.

40:53.770 --> 40:55.770
You all should achieve it,

40:56.198 --> 40:59.353
it's very important because you are out and out seekers.

40:59.726 --> 41:01.799
But first you must have your self-estimation.

41:02.498 --> 41:04.842
You must know that you are not here to play

41:05.342 --> 41:07.342
these games with yourself.

41:07.842 --> 41:09.842
All kinds of games are available.

41:09.907 --> 41:11.617
The industries have provided,

41:11.881 --> 41:13.881
the Industrial Revolution has provided,

41:14.381 --> 41:17.531
all modern thinkers and the books and all that have got it

41:17.777 --> 41:21.408
and to add it gurus have come from India to supply

41:22.470 --> 41:23.872
this demand market.

41:24.970 --> 41:26.650
So the picture is complete.

41:27.838 --> 41:31.172
This should not upset,

41:32.614 --> 41:37.264
because behind all fakeness and falsehood there has to be the reality.

41:38.362 --> 41:40.650
If you see thousands of

41:41.150 --> 41:44.957
artificial flowers you must know there has to be one real rose.

41:46.381 --> 41:50.373
And in the same way behind all this falsehood

41:52.177 --> 41:55.425
and confusion there is reality

41:55.599 --> 41:57.599
which is so beautiful within yourself

41:58.298 --> 42:00.759
which you have to achieve through Kundalini awakening.

42:01.476 --> 42:04.302
In short now I will tell you about the other centres

42:04.621 --> 42:06.621
because if you go through this book

42:07.266 --> 42:08.165
you will know

42:08.285 --> 42:11.117
about the names and things but in short I can tell you.

42:11.726 --> 42:13.028
That the third centre

42:13.184 --> 42:14.822
is the centre of our seeking

42:15.920 --> 42:18.658
is the center by which we are seeking,

42:19.012 --> 42:21.012
is the navel centre is

42:21.658 --> 42:24.886
by which amoeba, an amoeba felt hungry,

42:25.386 --> 42:28.704
he was seeking food. In seeking food only

42:29.204 --> 42:31.478
we went up to the stage of

42:32.215 --> 42:34.765
say mammoth and all these big animals.

42:34.882 --> 42:36.882
But they were such unwieldly big things

42:37.528 --> 42:39.528
that they could not maintain themselves.

42:39.882 --> 42:42.153
So then the intelligent animals came in.

42:42.434 --> 42:43.522
In that also

42:43.712 --> 42:45.712
some of them were very horrid ones

42:45.884 --> 42:47.392
like foxes and all that.

42:48.530 --> 42:51.373
Then very powerful animals came up

42:51.509 --> 42:53.509
who had more physical power

42:53.718 --> 42:55.718
than their big body.

42:55.908 --> 42:57.908
Like that we develop

42:57.971 --> 43:01.339
with this seeking up to a point when we became really human beings

43:01.985 --> 43:04.224
and when we became human beings

43:04.378 --> 43:08.101
we started seeking things like possessions;

43:08.802 --> 43:11.852
if not possession, like power,

43:12.206 --> 43:18.215
in politics, economics, social work, social things

43:18.897 --> 43:20.897
and lastly, the Spirit.

43:22.326 --> 43:25.162
Spirit is the solution for all of them.

43:27.483 --> 43:31.104
Without the light you cannot see anything in this world.

43:32.442 --> 43:35.308
I cannot see you without any light in there.

43:35.626 --> 43:41.332
To me, in darkness you are nothing but darkness. I don't see it.

43:42.597 --> 43:44.597
I cannot relate one to another.

43:44.769 --> 43:48.792
I do not know who are sitting here and listening to me,

43:49.893 --> 43:53.342
but once there is light you can see everything clearly,

43:53.842 --> 43:55.622
and that's what it is, happens.

43:55.758 --> 43:57.758
That when you get your enlightenment

43:58.258 --> 44:00.929
you become the master of yourself.

44:03.250 --> 44:05.899
This is the end of the seeking which starts.

44:06.399 --> 44:09.102
In this seeking only, around the seeking

44:09.602 --> 44:13.173
are our sustenance’s are developed gradually

44:13.436 --> 44:15.563
and ultimately we become human beings.

44:15.771 --> 44:18.376
And for human beings there are ten sustenance’s

44:18.767 --> 44:20.767
described in the Ten Commandments.

44:20.921 --> 44:22.921
When I talk about Ten Commandments,

44:23.421 --> 44:25.348
a one gentleman got very angry and said "You are

44:25.374 --> 44:27.374
a Christian, you are a Christian, you are a Christian!"

44:29.295 --> 44:31.295
But Ten Commandments were written

44:31.522 --> 44:34.036
when there were Jews, they were not written,

44:34.135 --> 44:36.406
Moses was not a Christian, he was a Jew

44:36.451 --> 44:38.177
and the Jew got angry with me

44:38.367 --> 44:39.857
that I was a Christian.

44:41.304 --> 44:42.560
Moses, Abraham,

44:44.299 --> 44:46.299
Confucius, Socrates,

44:48.311 --> 44:51.340
Mohammed, Nanak, Janak,

44:52.059 --> 44:54.645
Lao Tse, these are the

44:55.837 --> 44:57.837
Primordial masters.

44:58.865 --> 45:01.717
The principle of primordial masters, the Adi-Gurus

45:02.181 --> 45:03.783
who incarnated on this earth

45:04.356 --> 45:07.890
to teach us how to keep our sustenance.

45:08.736 --> 45:12.936
They taught against all strong alcohols and strong things.

45:13.254 --> 45:15.254
Christ did not talk

45:15.991 --> 45:17.617
but it does not mean that when He said

45:17.643 --> 45:19.643
He converted into wine, means He

45:19.706 --> 45:20.900
fermented the wine.

45:20.948 --> 45:23.400
You cannot ferment the wine in a minute, you understand that.

45:24.902 --> 45:27.899
Wine is a very common word, even today if you go

45:28.399 --> 45:30.783
will find that wine means

45:31.848 --> 45:33.515
grapes. I mean even

45:34.015 --> 45:36.015
a creeper of the grape is called a wine,

45:36.260 --> 45:38.260
even the juice of he thing is called wine.

45:38.596 --> 45:40.606
Now to differentiate we are starting to call it

45:40.632 --> 45:42.632
grape juice. But it is very, very

45:42.640 --> 45:44.064
loose, but you will be surprised it is a very

45:44.218 --> 45:47.607
... About fifty years back people must have started or something like that

45:47.852 --> 45:50.806
in India, but may be abroad, I don't know.

45:50.922 --> 45:55.098
Even today many people call it a wine "raksasia",

45:55.397 --> 45:58.253
even in Indian language it is called as the wine.

45:58.534 --> 46:01.070
Any grape juice is called as a wine.

46:02.795 --> 46:05.308
So there are many other things

46:05.388 --> 46:06.971
which these people told us

46:07.124 --> 46:09.958
that you should not do, to keep yourself in the centre.

46:11.427 --> 46:15.732
Now I divide our mistakes into categories.

46:18.298 --> 46:21.440
The first mistake we have is not to believe

46:21.702 --> 46:23.259
that God Almighty

46:23.759 --> 46:25.759
is going to look after our well-being.

46:26.844 --> 46:28.844
Krishna has said very clearly

46:29.070 --> 46:31.361
that Yoga kshemam Vahaamyaham. Meaning

46:31.386 --> 46:34.224
after Yoga, after union with God,

46:34.724 --> 46:36.724
I will look after your well being.

46:38.942 --> 46:40.942
That means you should get connected.

46:41.205 --> 46:43.442
Supposing I am not an Australian citizen

46:43.558 --> 46:45.906
why will Australian Government look after me?

46:47.741 --> 46:50.249
In the same way if you are not the members

46:50.658 --> 46:52.231
of God's community

46:52.495 --> 46:55.487
or if you are not entered into the Kingdom of God

46:55.805 --> 46:57.987
or if you are not a citizen of His Kingdom,

46:58.834 --> 47:01.855
it is not His responsibility to look after your well being.

47:02.721 --> 47:06.083
I mean of course He has created you, so He looks after you.

47:06.930 --> 47:12.231
But otherwise it's not certain that He'll look after you.

47:15.857 --> 47:18.931
People demand so much from God,

47:19.431 --> 47:21.063
they think they are already connected.

47:21.746 --> 47:25.519
They treat Him as if you can find Him somewhere under the stone.

47:26.951 --> 47:29.336
They go on demanding please look after my son,

47:29.379 --> 47:31.379
please do this, praying morning till evening,

47:31.879 --> 47:32.986
I mean it's pestering.

47:34.327 --> 47:36.086
When you are not connected with God,

47:36.879 --> 47:38.154
if you go on

47:38.654 --> 47:40.965
doing like this to any human being also,

47:41.319 --> 47:42.330
you'll get arrested.

47:45.591 --> 47:48.366
And that's what happens, that we live under myths:

47:48.372 --> 47:51.909
"Oh I have been praying and God has given me this,

47:53.341 --> 47:55.341
and I have been doing this."

47:55.439 --> 47:57.439
But we don't see, do we deserve it?

47:58.835 --> 48:02.500
Are we the Spirit? Have we tried to be the Spirit?

48:03.000 --> 48:06.498
We have done all kinds of things but to be the Spirit.

48:07.272 --> 48:10.644
When you are the Spirit then you are really blessed -

48:11.144 --> 48:12.031
really blessed,

48:13.409 --> 48:15.409
not only by His powers

48:15.708 --> 48:17.708
but you become the master of your being,

48:18.117 --> 48:21.001
and you start manifesting your own powers.

48:23.713 --> 48:26.438
This seeking and the surrounding dharma

48:27.176 --> 48:29.376
which is looked after by the Primordial masters

48:30.041 --> 48:34.085
is another centre here, above that is the centre

48:34.804 --> 48:36.804
of the Mother of the Universe,

48:36.865 --> 48:38.530
who gives us the security.

48:41.359 --> 48:43.466
This one when spoiled

48:43.643 --> 48:45.966
the security, the sense of security spoiled

48:46.252 --> 48:47.505
especially among women,

48:48.005 --> 48:51.183
when they feel that their husband are negligent or they are

48:51.875 --> 48:54.810
flirting with other women and all sorts of things.

48:55.417 --> 48:57.633
Then this centre goes but of order.

48:58.667 --> 49:00.667
When this centre goes out of order,

49:01.167 --> 49:05.127
then they develop diseases like breast cancer.

49:08.362 --> 49:09.503
Breast cancer

49:09.533 --> 49:12.911
is more common in societies where they have divorces.

49:14.266 --> 49:16.439
I have given a regular speech on this

49:16.554 --> 49:19.227
which you should get from Sydney and you will know all about it.

49:20.176 --> 49:22.475
Now the right side heart which you see here

49:22.825 --> 49:24.825
is the centre of a Father,

49:25.389 --> 49:27.737
the left one is the centre of the Mother.

49:30.438 --> 49:34.257
The right side heart centre catches when as a father

49:34.565 --> 49:36.162
you have not done your duties

49:36.769 --> 49:39.109
or if your father has died very early,

49:39.823 --> 49:42.795
you were shocked, then also it can happen.

49:43.658 --> 49:46.515
Anorexia and all these diseases can also be

49:46.737 --> 49:49.020
caused by this kind of happenings

49:49.520 --> 49:51.498
or also asthma.

49:51.763 --> 49:54.387
Asthma is invariably is caused

49:54.887 --> 49:56.887
by this centre going out of order.

49:59.331 --> 50:01.763
The left side is the centre of the Mother,

50:02.690 --> 50:04.927
our father and mother we chose.

50:06.153 --> 50:08.153
Before our birth we chose them.

50:08.717 --> 50:11.389
It was foolish to choose horrible parents.

50:12.039 --> 50:13.362
But you better pay for it.

50:15.379 --> 50:16.887
In one lifetime

50:17.195 --> 50:19.519
it is better to pay for the horrible ones

50:19.741 --> 50:21.741
so that next time you won't have them again.

50:24.634 --> 50:27.376
But we are not to judge them.

50:27.876 --> 50:29.609
If they are not seekers

50:29.660 --> 50:31.852
it's a very difficult thing to live with them, I know.

50:32.673 --> 50:34.673
It's very difficult to live with parents

50:34.767 --> 50:36.507
who are morning till evening

50:36.559 --> 50:40.070
counting every penny, counting every tin which are emptied,

50:40.314 --> 50:43.867
every tube that is emptied, they store up,

50:44.175 --> 50:45.614
they are so materialistic

50:46.114 --> 50:49.550
and you just can't bear such people, I can quite understand.

50:50.050 --> 50:52.685
Even a wife could be like that, and a husband could be like that,

50:52.843 --> 50:54.843
extremely materialistic, you will be fed up.

50:55.343 --> 50:59.064
They write down everything, every lamp post they must know,

51:00.312 --> 51:02.569
count everything.

51:02.791 --> 51:04.985
Today a lady who interviewed me asked me,

51:05.164 --> 51:08.161
"How many people, Mother, have you given Realisation

51:08.490 --> 51:10.555
and how many people you have cured."

51:10.649 --> 51:13.018
I said "You better ask the sun first of all

51:13.091 --> 51:15.894
how many leaves it has made green, then talk to me."

51:19.727 --> 51:21.480
I never write any accounts,

51:21.546 --> 51:24.514
leave alone of human beings, even of money.

51:25.014 --> 51:26.647
I never write, I have no time,

51:26.677 --> 51:29.250
I have no understanding as how to write accounts.

51:29.280 --> 51:32.388
Next life maybe I will be an accountant, for your information.

51:36.435 --> 51:40.726
So this happens to us when we become

51:42.252 --> 51:44.762
against our parents.

51:45.262 --> 51:48.034
I don't say that you should carry on

51:48.299 --> 51:50.351
with mad people, there's no use

51:50.381 --> 51:53.516
asking the bull to come and hit you, is correct.

51:54.016 --> 51:55.738
But you need not judge them,

51:55.832 --> 51:57.255
you can leave them, stay away

51:57.328 --> 51:59.328
and do not have them in your life, it's alright.

52:00.127 --> 52:02.509
But if you are taking

52:02.774 --> 52:05.896
interest in them as well as fighting with them morning till evening,

52:06.033 --> 52:07.712
then you catch on this heart chakra.

52:09.451 --> 52:13.066
I would say that in this respect Indians are sensible people.

52:14.143 --> 52:17.619
They are very sensible that they keep their parents all right.

52:18.226 --> 52:19.841
And the parents are also yet

52:19.985 --> 52:22.469
very sensible people. They love their children, they give

52:22.478 --> 52:24.478
everything that they have to the children,

52:24.615 --> 52:30.271
and children start really loving their parents,

52:30.429 --> 52:32.429
till they die they look after them.

52:33.933 --> 52:36.387
The result of that is of course very bad,

52:36.887 --> 52:40.274
because here in all the western countries the parents

52:40.475 --> 52:43.299
are still in a bridal mood, I mean they are brides

52:43.991 --> 52:45.991
and the bridegrooms you see

52:46.491 --> 52:49.709
they never become old enough to be parents.

52:49.740 --> 52:51.587
Seen even an eighty year old man you will find

52:51.595 --> 52:53.765
marry an eighteen year old girl. I mean

52:53.816 --> 52:55.816
it's a thing going on all the time. God knows

52:56.316 --> 52:58.316
what sort of intelligence is that?

52:59.008 --> 53:01.500
But with all that happening

53:01.658 --> 53:03.658
poor children do not know

53:03.923 --> 53:05.605
which parents to be chosen.

53:06.105 --> 53:08.427
And the last judgement has started, now what to do?

53:09.269 --> 53:11.269
Now you place yourself in their places

53:11.342 --> 53:12.674
and think what would you do

53:12.768 --> 53:14.938
when you know such crazy parents that today

53:14.947 --> 53:16.712
they are together, tomorrow they are divorced.

53:17.212 --> 53:19.082
On the streets they will be kissing,

53:19.347 --> 53:20.647
hugging each other,

53:21.147 --> 53:24.459
doing all kind of nonsensical thing. Very embarrassing also,

53:25.579 --> 53:26.745
and if you ask them where are you

53:26.796 --> 53:28.796
going they say they are going to the divorce case.

53:32.672 --> 53:36.248
These kinds of absurdities are taking place and because of that

53:36.748 --> 53:38.748
children don't want to get birth

53:39.974 --> 53:41.824
in all these places; England,

53:41.851 --> 53:44.452
Germany, Switzerland, everywhere.

53:45.358 --> 53:49.441
The birth rate is towards the minus side.

53:49.941 --> 53:51.941
In Germany especially, West Germany

53:52.227 --> 53:54.468
and East Germany of all the things

53:54.519 --> 53:57.707
people give so much money that a woman if she produces

53:57.780 --> 54:01.062
three children she earns more money than their Prime Minister.

54:01.562 --> 54:03.562
But still women don't want to produce.

54:04.062 --> 54:06.839
They want to be free, independent, they don't want to be mothers.

54:07.617 --> 54:09.940
As a result this poor India

54:09.991 --> 54:12.856
has to accommodate for all the children born today

54:14.296 --> 54:17.582
and we are blamed for over population,

54:18.082 --> 54:20.718
now what to do? We have to bear the load.

54:24.017 --> 54:26.622
So also it is your responsibility

54:27.015 --> 54:29.299
to see if you do not produce children

54:29.350 --> 54:31.437
at least those who are producing children

54:31.638 --> 54:35.229
have some compassion for them

54:35.387 --> 54:37.474
and have some understanding.

54:37.504 --> 54:39.976
Do not blame them. Oh everybody tells me,

54:40.155 --> 54:42.802
what about your problem of population.

54:43.708 --> 54:47.295
I tell them now who is responsible for our population

54:49.291 --> 54:52.391
because in that country even if you have fourteen children,

54:52.891 --> 54:54.891
they love all their children that are there.

54:55.989 --> 54:59.429
They are not so ego-orientated that their hearts are not closed,

55:00.420 --> 55:02.420
they are not so unemotional,

55:03.198 --> 55:07.317
anybody who has no child will go to

55:07.368 --> 55:08.916
all the holy places

55:09.587 --> 55:12.084
and ask for blessings that they should get children,

55:13.161 --> 55:14.222
to get a child

55:14.231 --> 55:17.785
is such a blessing in India and child is such an important thing.

55:20.123 --> 55:22.530
But the mistake they are committing

55:22.581 --> 55:25.577
is just the other than yours.

55:26.376 --> 55:28.676
The mistake in those developing countries

55:28.706 --> 55:31.559
is that they do not believe that God Almighty

55:31.653 --> 55:34.438
is the One who is going to look after your well being.

55:35.152 --> 55:37.354
They don't believe in the power of their Father,

55:37.427 --> 55:39.588
so they do the crime against the Father or

55:39.597 --> 55:41.047
you can say the sin against the Father.

55:41.782 --> 55:44.314
When you don't believe in the capacity of your Father,

55:46.160 --> 55:49.579
so there is bribery, corruption, all sorts of things going on, you know

55:49.844 --> 55:52.941
cutting corners and money and all those things go on.

55:54.125 --> 55:55.866
Still in India I would not say that

55:56.772 --> 56:00.529
ordinary people are dishonest. I mean our bureaucrats may be, our

56:00.751 --> 56:03.666
politicians may be and business people may be. But

56:03.781 --> 56:05.781
ordinary people are very honest in India.

56:07.798 --> 56:09.047
But this is what happens.

56:10.055 --> 56:12.688
On the other side, you see supposing

56:13.188 --> 56:15.589
an Indian comes to your house, be careful

56:16.635 --> 56:20.108
he may run away with anything that you have in the house, anything,

56:20.608 --> 56:22.907
see, but

56:23.030 --> 56:25.842
if an American comes to your house, be careful about your wife.

56:27.641 --> 56:30.063
He may run away with your wife or with your daughter.

56:31.467 --> 56:34.990
Or say an Englishman comes he'll do it in a subtler way

56:35.490 --> 56:36.583
because he's a scholar.

56:37.893 --> 56:40.659
So he reads some poetry to your wife

56:40.971 --> 56:42.722
and in the night you find she is missing.

56:46.988 --> 56:50.042
This is fundamental, I mean the wife

56:50.467 --> 56:52.599
who runs away like this creates problem

56:53.965 --> 56:55.965
fundamentally for the household.

56:56.653 --> 56:58.653
Just think in a house,

56:59.022 --> 57:02.989
where there are children, there is husband, kitchen

57:03.489 --> 57:06.271
and all the places, everybody sleeping nicely,

57:06.771 --> 57:08.257
early in the morning they find

57:08.286 --> 57:11.505
that the main pole of the house is missing and the whole thing is collapsed.

57:12.250 --> 57:15.595
What will happen to the children, nobody thinks.

57:17.460 --> 57:18.604
Nobody understands

57:19.104 --> 57:21.707
or they think they are being in love

57:22.358 --> 57:23.503
so they must go.

57:24.210 --> 57:27.457
Men do the same. I mean there is no difference between men and women.

57:29.577 --> 57:32.990
But this is the sin against the Mother

57:36.089 --> 57:39.453
that the women have to be respectable and respected.

57:41.874 --> 57:45.365
Housewives’ position is within us

57:45.413 --> 57:47.413
here on the left hand side, nabhi

57:48.666 --> 57:50.171
and if a housewife,

57:50.332 --> 57:52.654
the deity of housewife, is not in our house,

57:52.740 --> 57:55.027
not that the woman but the housewife,

57:57.335 --> 57:59.335
then our spleen goes out.

58:01.229 --> 58:04.606
We get, children get crazy,

58:05.106 --> 58:07.903
why is there in-disciplined. Somebody asked me today

58:07.951 --> 58:12.632
what happens to the people like who try to kill Reagan?

58:13.149 --> 58:15.149
I said, ask his mother.

58:17.043 --> 58:20.126
She must be after the life of the child, morning till evening

58:20.626 --> 58:23.910
and that's why he's taking action,

58:24.033 --> 58:26.448
or is a reaction of what has happened to him.

58:27.664 --> 58:31.052
How do these complications arise

58:31.552 --> 58:33.552
has a basis in the family

58:34.542 --> 58:37.468
in the nest, that is your house.

58:39.437 --> 58:41.437
You have to live in the nest

58:42.427 --> 58:44.427
as a father and a mother

58:44.927 --> 58:46.390
looking after your children.

58:47.323 --> 58:49.970
Children are the most important things

58:51.091 --> 58:53.821
in the whole world for human beings.

58:57.541 --> 58:59.731
Let the politics go to hell,

58:59.817 --> 59:02.328
and let the economics take its own course,

59:02.828 --> 59:04.086
but children

59:04.812 --> 59:07.618
are to be looked after, that's your primary duty.

59:09.380 --> 59:11.380
But in India we go to the other end,

59:11.673 --> 59:13.901
when we start look after our children we don't mind

59:13.930 --> 59:15.930
selling our countries also in the name of children.

59:18.897 --> 59:20.897
But we live with two extremes I feel,

59:20.926 --> 59:22.604
the sin against the Mother

59:22.727 --> 59:24.727
and the sin against the Father.

59:27.204 --> 59:29.204
When we sin against the Mother

59:30.231 --> 59:32.974
as Australians, as I am now an Australian,

59:33.079 --> 59:35.079
let us face what happens to us.

59:39.364 --> 59:42.538
Absolutely we are emotionally blackmailed by ourselves.

59:44.142 --> 59:47.267
We torture ourselves, we live with artificial things.

59:48.407 --> 59:51.312
Like if a wife

59:51.812 --> 59:54.416
wants to run away with another man

59:55.161 --> 59:58.770
we will even go to get a honeymoon ticket for her

59:59.025 --> 01:00:01.982
because we are very considerate good husbands.

01:00:03.518 --> 01:00:06.332
Same thing with the wives if she finds that the husband

01:00:06.381 --> 01:00:08.381
is interested in another woman,

01:00:08.448 --> 01:00:10.448
she should not be jealous.

01:00:10.948 --> 01:00:16.842
In Sahaja Yoga this is not very much appreciated.

01:00:17.681 --> 01:00:20.465
Husband has to behave, like a husband. He should make his wife

01:00:20.532 --> 01:00:21.371
run the house.

01:00:22.022 --> 01:00:24.022
And the woman has to be a woman.

01:00:25.897 --> 01:00:27.897
She must see to it that

01:00:28.246 --> 01:00:30.246
no danger is brought to the children.

01:00:31.254 --> 01:00:34.409
We have no business to hurt anyone like this

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:36.721
and we do not know how much we hurt,

01:00:37.221 --> 01:00:39.221
we give cancers to our wives and husbands.

01:00:40.324 --> 01:00:42.324
We give all kinds of horrible diseases,

01:00:42.692 --> 01:00:45.642
mental tortures we make them mad, by our

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:48.330
mad, capricious,

01:00:50.111 --> 01:00:54.674
very shallow, understanding of our emotions.

01:00:56.812 --> 01:00:59.661
A one man starts going to another woman,

01:01:00.161 --> 01:01:01.567
then he goes to another woman,

01:01:01.747 --> 01:01:03.306
then to ten women he goes

01:01:03.392 --> 01:01:05.106
and then ten men go to ten women

01:01:05.192 --> 01:01:08.543
and end up in a lunatic asylum or

01:01:08.779 --> 01:01:12.547
in the orphanage. I have seen in England we had a neighbor

01:01:12.708 --> 01:01:16.116
who had a very huge house, he died, he was an old man

01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:17.315
and you'd be surprised

01:01:17.815 --> 01:01:20.556
they did not discover his body for one month.

01:01:20.905 --> 01:01:23.355
Because there's no family feeling, nothing,

01:01:24.326 --> 01:01:27.074
even a rat doesn't enter that house. Can you imagine!

01:01:30.418 --> 01:01:32.663
This is what has happened in thinking,

01:01:32.730 --> 01:01:35.408
“I am separated, I am individualistic.

01:01:35.475 --> 01:01:38.602
I am exclusive”. If you are really individualistic,

01:01:39.046 --> 01:01:41.046
if you are really mature, individually,

01:01:41.998 --> 01:01:45.339
then you know the unity much better.

01:01:46.630 --> 01:01:49.271
Then you understand that you are the support

01:01:50.148 --> 01:01:54.631
of the whole because you are so matured.

01:01:56.638 --> 01:01:58.638
No wonder our children are not maturing.

01:01:59.345 --> 01:02:01.345
They are behaving in such a manner.

01:02:02.090 --> 01:02:05.501
We are responsible, we must accept that in our own

01:02:06.867 --> 01:02:09.913
ideas about compatibility and all this nonsense,

01:02:09.923 --> 01:02:11.711
we don’t have in India, we are quite comfortable,

01:02:11.721 --> 01:02:13.606
we are producing children quite all right.

01:02:15.085 --> 01:02:21.662
We have no problems. Why do you run after these capricious,

01:02:22.444 --> 01:02:24.444
these shallow ideas?

01:02:26.432 --> 01:02:28.432
You will be held responsible

01:02:29.874 --> 01:02:33.861
for all these horrible diseases that men and women have got,

01:02:34.361 --> 01:02:36.361
and the children that are going to suffer,

01:02:36.861 --> 01:02:41.388
if you have charity, better start it at home.

01:02:42.980 --> 01:02:44.447
Better be charitable

01:02:44.571 --> 01:02:46.947
to your own wife and to your own husband.

01:02:47.447 --> 01:02:49.926
Be charitable to your children.

01:02:50.012 --> 01:02:52.460
Don't go by concept of falling in love,

01:02:52.678 --> 01:02:54.678
you'll fall, really and make others fall too.

01:02:56.176 --> 01:02:59.293
It's a concept, just a concept.

01:02:59.793 --> 01:03:03.235
I think some of these horrible people must have given you this concept.

01:03:04.526 --> 01:03:05.996
If you really fall in love

01:03:06.082 --> 01:03:08.082
how do you get up to marry another person?

01:03:09.147 --> 01:03:11.598
You fall, marry another person,

01:03:12.249 --> 01:03:14.249
again ready to marry another person.

01:03:14.316 --> 01:03:15.886
You are holding the hand of a person

01:03:15.952 --> 01:03:17.953
who is suppose to be your beloved or whatever it is,

01:03:17.979 --> 01:03:19.979
and looking at another one.

01:03:21.063 --> 01:03:24.788
This concept is absolutely wrong. You have to grow in love.

01:03:27.567 --> 01:03:29.567
As your own child is

01:03:29.672 --> 01:03:32.834
in the same way is your companion. They are two parts

01:03:33.503 --> 01:03:34.641
of one chariot.

01:03:35.273 --> 01:03:37.922
One is the left and other is the right. They're not

01:03:38.930 --> 01:03:40.930
unequal, they're equal

01:03:40.997 --> 01:03:44.212
but they are not similar, they have their own role.

01:03:44.505 --> 01:03:47.040
And women have to take their role courageously,

01:03:48.011 --> 01:03:50.647
to be the mother, as I always say, look at me.

01:03:51.448 --> 01:03:55.506
I am a Mother and in no way,

01:03:56.797 --> 01:03:58.797
in any way, I cannot think

01:03:59.128 --> 01:04:01.128
I could be anything better than this.

01:04:04.208 --> 01:04:06.509
Now if I start thinking, Oh God,

01:04:06.651 --> 01:04:08.840
I am a Mother all right, but

01:04:09.340 --> 01:04:11.340
I must know how to drive,

01:04:12.311 --> 01:04:15.663
then I'm finished. I must know how to drive a bus,

01:04:16.370 --> 01:04:18.370
I must know how to drive a train!

01:04:18.908 --> 01:04:20.022
What is the need?

01:04:21.351 --> 01:04:23.598
I saw one photographer who came to see me.

01:04:23.759 --> 01:04:25.332
He was supposed to take my photograph

01:04:25.380 --> 01:04:27.380
and whole hands were fill with blisters.

01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:29.921
I said first let me cure your blisters.

01:04:29.950 --> 01:04:31.457
How you are going to take my photograph?

01:04:31.788 --> 01:04:34.660
I said what have you been doing with your, photography?

01:04:34.727 --> 01:04:37.434
No, he said, this, I went to a forest

01:04:37.633 --> 01:04:39.633
and I cut some trees. I said, for what?

01:04:39.982 --> 01:04:43.086
You are a photographer, your hands are soft and deft

01:04:43.530 --> 01:04:45.792
why do you want to kill the deftness of your fingers?

01:04:46.292 --> 01:04:49.222
He said, no we must do other things also. I said, why must you?

01:04:50.833 --> 01:04:52.852
You see the nose doesn’t do the work of the eyes

01:04:52.900 --> 01:04:54.900
and the eyes do not do the work of the ears.

01:04:55.400 --> 01:04:58.730
Why must you do, your hands are all finished! And this is what it is.

01:05:00.548 --> 01:05:03.047
To us we feel that men are great

01:05:03.152 --> 01:05:06.001
so we start saying, "let's do the man's work."

01:05:08.384 --> 01:05:10.914
The man thinks, why "should women be like this?"

01:05:10.981 --> 01:05:12.214
You are companions -

01:05:12.883 --> 01:05:16.376
you are eternal companions. You are two

01:05:18.383 --> 01:05:20.910
beautiful wheels of a chariot.

01:05:22.201 --> 01:05:24.201
This is to be grown

01:05:24.419 --> 01:05:25.912
and to be matured within you.

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.862
And when this centre is out,

01:05:28.136 --> 01:05:31.285
you get the problems of this centre

01:05:31.371 --> 01:05:34.076
by which you get asthma, tuberculosis,

01:05:35.593 --> 01:05:37.593
and the breast troubles.

01:05:37.622 --> 01:05:41.228
Men get asthma, very serious asthma and

01:05:41.257 --> 01:05:42.934
other problems of the lungs

01:05:43.001 --> 01:05:46.515
and ultimately, also lung cancer can develop.

01:05:48.748 --> 01:05:51.087
When you work too hard with the right hand side,

01:05:51.135 --> 01:05:54.406
you are ego orientated, that is ego develops too much,

01:05:54.473 --> 01:05:56.473
then your left side is neglected,

01:05:56.502 --> 01:05:59.286
you become unemotional, that time

01:05:59.409 --> 01:06:01.409
your heart gives a signal, you get a heart attack.

01:06:02.982 --> 01:06:04.982
When you do too much sometimes

01:06:05.444 --> 01:06:07.846
you may escape the heart attack, but you may get

01:06:07.951 --> 01:06:09.247
a  brain paralysis.

01:06:13.174 --> 01:06:16.115
We are bent upon destroying ourselves.

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:19.751
The destruction is going to come from within, not from without.

01:06:21.400 --> 01:06:24.533
Those people who are try to shock you, this will happen,

01:06:24.581 --> 01:06:27.168
that the sun is doing this, this is nothing.

01:06:27.517 --> 01:06:30.184
It's all within you, the destruction has started.

01:06:30.684 --> 01:06:33.976
You are facing it because

01:06:34.476 --> 01:06:37.838
you cannot accept it.

01:06:39.110 --> 01:06:40.429
You have to accept

01:06:41.682 --> 01:06:43.708
that this is a challenge, I am not

01:06:43.737 --> 01:06:46.336
going to allow myself to be destroyed by foolish and stupid

01:06:46.365 --> 01:06:47.631
ideas that are around.

01:06:49.299 --> 01:06:52.097
And then in your own estimation and glory

01:06:52.597 --> 01:06:55.472
you will be surprised. After realisation

01:06:55.482 --> 01:06:57.673
you will be enriched but

01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.626
without Realisation, I don't know,

01:06:59.712 --> 01:07:02.768
it becomes a lecture and a lecture, just a brainwash.

01:07:03.626 --> 01:07:05.626
That beautiful thing should happen to you,

01:07:05.975 --> 01:07:09.472
and once you find your beauty within yourself,

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.878
overnight I have seen people changed.

01:07:12.529 --> 01:07:14.529
Overnight it happens

01:07:15.029 --> 01:07:18.388
and I hope that will happen to you tonight.

01:07:18.888 --> 01:07:22.133
Today I have talked to you about this centre

01:07:22.633 --> 01:07:25.276
and later on I will be talking to you about

01:07:25.682 --> 01:07:28.099
two other centres which are here and here.

01:07:28.317 --> 01:07:30.317
And the Realisation that takes place,

01:07:30.817 --> 01:07:32.817
out of the limbic area,

01:07:33.034 --> 01:07:35.634
in the fontanel membrane,

01:07:35.910 --> 01:07:38.491
which is called as the Brahmarandra in Sanskrit language.

01:07:38.991 --> 01:07:40.991
Thank you very much. May God bless you.

01:07:42.546 --> 01:07:45.086
If you have any questions you please ask me.

01:07:47.488 --> 01:07:50.351
But questions should be something

01:07:50.822 --> 01:07:52.989
which are helpful, not some sort of

01:07:53.026 --> 01:07:54.883
quarrel. I am not here to quarrel with you.

01:07:55.214 --> 01:07:57.927
If you don't want your Realisation I am not going to force you.

01:07:58.427 --> 01:08:02.766
Please do not plead for any other organisation or any other guru,

01:08:03.266 --> 01:08:06.393
because I am not interested. I am only interested in you,

01:08:06.743 --> 01:08:08.743
I see that sparkle in you,

01:08:08.816 --> 01:08:11.684
that's why I am only interested in you, I'm not bothered about others.

01:08:12.184 --> 01:08:14.636
So you do not try to bring others ideas

01:08:14.837 --> 01:08:16.663
that this guru has said this or this

01:08:16.683 --> 01:08:18.446
one has said that and this is in the book.

01:08:19.308 --> 01:08:21.910
The proof of the pudding is that you haven't got your Realisation.

01:08:21.940 --> 01:08:23.940
If you have got it then you can go out.

01:08:26.064 --> 01:08:28.609
If you are sure you have got it, I don't want to force it on you.

01:08:28.724 --> 01:08:30.445
There's no quarrel about anything.

01:08:30.731 --> 01:08:32.731
There's no election on, nothing.

01:08:32.975 --> 01:08:34.184
You cannot give me anything.

01:08:34.235 --> 01:08:37.299
There's no shopping. It's a temple, you have come for a blessing.

01:08:37.799 --> 01:08:40.752
All right? Now you can ask the questions. Thank you very much.
