00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:13.010
… they dictate the information about their
attack, how they’re attacking about.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:29.550
Now, we have to know that there is a war on
between the satanic forces and the Divine

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.550
forces.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:42.930
Now you are the people who have chosen to
be Divine.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.710
But, even if you have chosen that and God
has accepted you, and has given you your own

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.480
powers, still you must know that you are still
vulnerable, very much, to the attack of the

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480
negativity upon you.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:01:00.870
Now always, one has to remember that Divine
will win in any case: there is no doubt about

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:01.870
it.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:13.409
Supposing you fail the Divine, you will be
the losers, not the Divine.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:23.799
If you all fail the Divine then you will be
destroyed as negatives so, in the ultimate

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:26.999
destruction, Divine will finish off all that
is satanic, there is no doubt about it.

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:30.729
But how many people are going to be destroyed,
is the point.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:43.189
So you all have to be very much alert that
you are to be saved and you are not going

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:55.270
to be one of those who are destroyed.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:02:10.030
The more we save, the better will be our enjoyment;
the more people we save, there will be a greater

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:23.310
power flowing and the effect of that impact
will be such that we might ourselves able

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.819
to be rid all that is satanic and a very little
will be left which will be destroyed.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.080
So the responsibility on the Sahaja Yogis
is to understand that there is a war going

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.080
on.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.269
Now, this war is within and without: first
basic thing: within and without.

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.360
First we must see the within war.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:45.090
The within war is this that we are the Spirit
– or not, very basically: we are the Spirit

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.970
or we are not the Spirit.

00:02:47.970 --> 00:03:13.450
If we are the Spirit, that means we are not
Ego, we are not Superego and we are not this

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:24.610
body, this mind or anything but we are the
Spirit, which is perfect.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:31.099
So all the imperfections that come within
us are our own, and we are responsible for

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:38.969
the imperfections, because whatever God does
is perfect.

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:49.840
And when we see that there are imperfections
– I mean, that is also a very big ‘if’:

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:56.140
“if we see”, because that seeing is also
not possible for many people: they are so

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:01.359
blinded by their ego, they cannot see it,
they are not aware of it.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:07.480
Or some are so blinded by their possessions
and superego, they cannot see it.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.480
If you tell them that, “You have a superego”,
they get double ego-d; if you tell them “You

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.859
have an ego”, they get superego-d, because
they are still identified with them.

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:22.300
So, to be able to see first of all is the
first step but, if you see – if, absolutely

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:34.500
a big ‘if’ – see that you are not perfect,
that you are not to justify your imperfections,

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.370
that you are not your imperfections, but you
are your ‘perfect being’; you are actually,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.930
but just now you are not.

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:49.570
So the movement is very, very slippery, in
the beginning.

00:04:49.570 --> 00:05:00.100
So, one by one, you must put your foot steadily
as a climber on a snowy mountain does: first

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.890
step should be that, “Can we see our imperfections?”

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:17.490
Not others’; first of all not to see others’
is the first principle of Sahaja Yoga.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.460
First principle of Sahaja Yoga is not to see
others’ imperfections.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.070
What is the gain?

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:28.780
I mean, I just can’t understand this, you
know, because I am very differently made;

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.030
I can’t understand, what’s the

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:31.530
use of seeing imperfections of others?

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.330
I mean, you cannot correct it, you cannot
do anything about it; by seeing them, you

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:50.050
do not improve, by seeing their … you cannot
improve collectivity.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.690
So there is no sense in seeing others’ imperfections.

00:05:53.690 --> 00:06:05.030
Now, first of all see your own problems, your
own angularity, your own misidentifications

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:06.650
and imperfections.

00:06:06.650 --> 00:06:12.389
When you start seeing them, then the first
thing you will do, best way to avoid everything

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:21.100
– I mean, avoidance is a very great character
of human beings, but in a subtle way it is

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:27.470
insincerity to yourself, to your ascent and
to God.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:28.880
So face it.

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:37.810
Now, you see your imperfections correctly,
in the sense, ”you see, “Yes I am possessed

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:39.160
no doubt.

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.910
If I am possessed, why should I be possessed?

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:51.759
I must do everything that is under my control
to get rid of it."

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:59.090
Now, a possessed person is always an abnormal
person; either he doesn’t talk or if he

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.430
talks, he talks too loudly.

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:10.810
They are in dualities, always remain: either
he’s very hot-tempered or he is over- sweet.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:20.830
Any person who is extremely sweet – all
the time, is very sweet, never gets angry

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:22.349
– that’s abnormal.

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:26.650
Should be able to sometimes show your anger;
for example, somebody beats your Mother, won’t

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.699
you be angry at that point?

00:07:29.699 --> 00:07:34.060
You should be angry.

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:40.889
You have to be, I mean, if you have a personality
and a discreet, wise personality, you should

00:07:40.889 --> 00:07:45.090
be angry if somebody does anything to your
Mother, you should be angry; that anger is

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:53.330
given for that right correction of a person
who tries to harm the source of wisdom, source

00:07:53.330 --> 00:07:55.470
of everything.

00:07:55.470 --> 00:08:02.300
So, that anger is all right, justified.

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:12.370
And in that way one should again not to be
deluded that if Mother has said that, “That

00:08:12.370 --> 00:08:16.199
time, anger is all right,” then anger is
justified.

00:08:16.199 --> 00:08:22.199
This is the trouble with human beings is that,
they generalise everything.

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:25.669
So one has to know one thing that you were
human beings; now today, you are yogis but

00:08:25.669 --> 00:08:28.770
you were a human being.

00:08:28.770 --> 00:08:34.669
And that human being-ness is still there in
you, still lingering in you, and all these

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:40.860
things are like caterpillars – parts are
still hanging round you that you still behave

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:43.840
like human beings; you should not: you should
behave like a yogi.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:51.670
And yogi is discreet by nature; he knows where
to get angry, he knows where not to get angry.

00:08:51.670 --> 00:09:01.550
But for a Sahaja Yogi, one has to learn it,
by dropping out all those human being-ness

00:09:01.550 --> 00:09:04.540
that is attacking, attached to you.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:13.440
So the discretion, and that wise discretion,
is to be developed; like Krishna has said

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.200
that, “You have to go and fight.

00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:21.500
Take the swords in your hand and fight the
enemies."

00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:27.250
Now, one would say “then Krishna has said,
“Take a sword in your hand”, now go on

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:31.209
killing everyone!” Then even Hitler-ism
can be justified.

00:09:31.209 --> 00:09:35.529
He said “your enemies” – this is important
– your enemies.

00:09:35.529 --> 00:09:39.610
Now, who are your enemies?

00:09:39.610 --> 00:09:48.640
Who go against your ascent! They are six in
number; one is lust.

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:49.860
Lust.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:59.839
Of course, perversions are out of question,
but even too much of lust – like, you see

00:09:59.839 --> 00:10:02.790
too much attachment to husband, too much attachment
to wife.

00:10:02.790 --> 00:10:07.589
But the other side is also there; running
away from sex is another nonsense you see.

00:10:07.589 --> 00:10:12.240
That’s another sign that you are possessed;
definitely, no doubt about it.

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:19.320
If you are husband and wife, you must have
sex life but a sensible one.

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:22.610
And the relationship should be such that it
should ultimately

00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:29.740
culminate into it, and not the way people
all the time think of sex; if you think normally

00:10:29.740 --> 00:10:31.710
of sex, then it’s something wrong.

00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:38.800
Only when you reach a point of that thing,
then you should feel it – I mean, that’s

00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:39.800
the normal way.

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.279
Like when, we don’t think all the time of
water, do we?

00:10:41.279 --> 00:10:44.430
When we are thirsty, only then we think isn’t
it?

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:48.870
But those who think about water all the time,
means we must be having lots of thirsty people

00:10:48.870 --> 00:10:55.890
within you, that they are asking for, “Water,
water, water, water, water …”

00:10:55.890 --> 00:11:02.640
It’s a point where you reach, where you
feel hungry about it and there is a sense,

00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:04.880
there is a way of taking water.

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:08.339
How much particular we are about taking ordinary
thing like water?

00:11:08.339 --> 00:11:13.470
“It should be from a clean source; whether
it is coming from the kitchen or not – we’ll

00:11:13.470 --> 00:11:15.139
first find out.

00:11:15.139 --> 00:11:21.019
It should be in a clean glass, from a clean
person …” Everything; we are very fussy

00:11:21.019 --> 00:11:22.019
on that point.

00:11:22.019 --> 00:11:29.690
I wish you could be the same way fussy about
our married lives that, this is something

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:34.610
where we put your heart and mind: “Are we
clean enough, are we sweet enough, are we

00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:35.610
all right?”

00:11:35.610 --> 00:11:41.880
So, this is one of the very important attacks
I have seen: you marry a person and is finished,

00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.149
in this country.

00:11:43.149 --> 00:11:44.850
In India it’s different.

00:11:44.850 --> 00:11:49.610
Here, if you marry a person, suddenly you
find – God knows what happens – they all

00:11:49.610 --> 00:11:51.250
end up into lunatic asylums.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:58.510
I mean, that’s a path for them to drop out;
one of the big sieves is marriage in the West.

00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:06.850
So, these sieves are there, so be careful
not to drop out of the sieves.

00:12:06.850 --> 00:12:11.540
And keep your mind upon yourself, judging
yourself how we work out.

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:19.180
So, the first one is kama – is the lust.
Second, very important, is krodha Jog.

00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:25.670
Krishna has put krodha above kam.; you see,
anger: heated personality, angry.

00:12:25.670 --> 00:12:33.180
He thinks that krodha comes even before kama;
He was so much against anger.

00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:34.610
Anger.

00:12:34.610 --> 00:12:37.519
If you are an angry person, take out anger
upon yourself, beat yourself nicely; best

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:45.730
thing is to beat your face, then you are hurt
a little bit so you’ll remember it, to begin

00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:46.730
with.

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:52.900
Then you beat yourself on the ground with
shoes every morning.

00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:54.029
You get angry?

00:12:54.029 --> 00:12:58.550
All right – have it, have it, have it!

00:12:58.550 --> 00:13:04.779
Because this heated temperament is a big curse;
is your enemy.

00:13:04.779 --> 00:13:10.090
That gives you a very great weakness against
collectivity.

00:13:10.090 --> 00:13:19.050
You see, a heated man never realises that
he’s an angry man and that’s the base

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:29.260
of satanic forces, because they act on you
because they’re angry with you; they are

00:13:29.260 --> 00:13:33.070
jealous, may be any reason – they’re angry
with God.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.320
The whole base is anger and hatred.

00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:42.470
So the second point is, we should see: have
we got anger within us?

00:13:42.470 --> 00:13:46.730
If you have anger, you cannot enjoy a sunshine,
you cannot enjoy a flower; you cannot enjoy

00:13:46.730 --> 00:13:47.730
anything.

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:54.920
Ultimately, you can’t even bear yourself;
the best way to punish such a person is to

00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:58.860
put him in a jail, alone, then he faces himself,
then he gets rid of it.

00:13:58.860 --> 00:14:04.230
That’s the best way, I think; there’s
no other way I can understand – that separate

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.230
him.

00:14:05.230 --> 00:14:08.899
Let him put into seclusions; when he goes
through the seclusion, he’ll have to face

00:14:08.899 --> 00:14:14.600
himself and then he looks at him, gets angry…
hee, hee, hee, hee.

00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.149
And then that anger goes away.

00:14:18.149 --> 00:14:22.259
If you keep with them with others, you see,
then he has a chance to get more angry; maybe

00:14:22.259 --> 00:14:25.050
he might grow into his anger more.

00:14:25.050 --> 00:14:30.019
So, the Kama, krodha, madha – madha is the
third thing.

00:14:30.019 --> 00:14:33.029
Kama, krodha, madha.

00:14:33.029 --> 00:14:39.890
Madha is what you call – is the pride.

00:14:39.890 --> 00:14:47.940
Or pride is a decent word: vanity.

00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:54.740
It comes out of ignorance: if you are supposed
to be good-looking … I don’t know, they

00:14:54.740 --> 00:14:55.740
call it –

00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:01.040
understanding of good-looking and beauty is
also so different, that I used to think somebody

00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:07.699
is a very ugly man and it seems that he’s
supposed to be handsome, according to Western

00:15:07.699 --> 00:15:08.699
standards.

00:15:08.699 --> 00:15:14.040
I said, “Oh God, how can he be handsome?”
“Yes, he’s very handsome, Mother."

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.100
And I was surprised that how, according to
Indian standards, nobody would marry such

00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.160
a man, you see.

00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.640
But such a man here is a very handsome man.

00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:29.800
Is most surprising that how our ideas of beauty
also change.

00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:37.630
But I would say in this, fundamentally, one
should understand that those people who normalise

00:15:37.630 --> 00:15:42.470
everything by their thinking … you see,
“The beauty should be …” means this.

00:15:42.470 --> 00:15:47.589
“This thing, face should be such, the nose
should be such and this and that” – is

00:15:47.589 --> 00:15:54.699
all being sort of measured out you see: “This
is beautiful."

00:15:54.699 --> 00:16:03.980
Then, all these ideas of beauty that are thought
up – not spontaneous, not spontaneous, again

00:16:03.980 --> 00:16:06.290
I say – are not beauty.

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:12.430
So, people who have pride about these things
like, “Oh, I have a very beautiful house."

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:17.370
May be the ugliest house you could think of;
could be the ugliest, I tell you, some of

00:16:17.370 --> 00:16:22.589
the houses I just couldn’t enter in, I felt
like vomiting.

00:16:22.589 --> 00:16:26.329
And, for some people, it’s the house one
should go and visit, it seems: all bhoots

00:16:26.329 --> 00:16:27.870
sitting here and there.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:32.940
If it was a beautiful house, no bhoot would
enter in.

00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.940
Is a suchita – is the … beauty is in purity.

00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:42.290
Purity is the expression of beauty: if you
have no purity, there cannot be beauty.

00:16:42.290 --> 00:16:49.080
[Aside: Now, will you please listen to Me
and then take a photograph.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:54.550
We have been trying for one hour and you’ll
try for three hours you cannot get it, so

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.510
you’d better listen to Me.]

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:05.950
Now, the purity of a person is very important
and then, once you have purity, you have no

00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:09.070
pride: you become prideless, absolutely prideless.

00:17:09.070 --> 00:17:10.070
Because that is also a kind of a stigma.

00:17:10.070 --> 00:17:11.070
When it is purity, everything drops out.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:29.860
So, to be proud of something, or vain – I
mean, all pride so called, are vanity: nobody’s

00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:32.130
rightly proud.

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:39.030
You have to be proud of your virtues because
you enjoy them: you have to be proud of things

00:17:39.030 --> 00:17:43.790
of which you enjoy – enjoy, not happy but
enjoy.

00:17:43.790 --> 00:17:49.240
Again, discrimination is needed.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:56.710
Now, when you start judging yourself like
that, you will be amazed – best is to judge

00:17:56.710 --> 00:18:01.840
by children’s reaction; not by a bhooty
child, but a good Realized soul child.

00:18:01.840 --> 00:18:10.630
Some women – you see I’ve seen, dressed
up with all that thing and everything like

00:18:10.630 --> 00:18:15.310
that, you see – and when a child sees, he
starts, “Heh, heh, heh, heh!” You see,

00:18:15.310 --> 00:18:21.130
he can’t bear the woman; and men are running
after her, you see, you can’t understand:

00:18:21.130 --> 00:18:22.130
a child just can’t bear.

00:18:22.130 --> 00:18:24.180
I have known many such cases, you see, where
the children would not look at them, they

00:18:24.180 --> 00:18:25.180
just start, “Ha, ha, ha!” like that.

00:18:25.180 --> 00:18:28.200
And best experience I had, when I was going
…

00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:36.960
Once, I went to Japan and we had a lady with
us – very self-conscious American lady,

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:41.800
dressed up like that and, I don’t know,
she had put some sort of a big thing on her

00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:43.620
head; God knows what was that.

00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:49.650
She took about three hours to get ready; she
went to a beauty salon and this thing, because

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:50.650
we were going to see some big man there.

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:57.380
And, this fellow had a house which was approached
by a long road where you had to climb up something:

00:18:57.380 --> 00:18:58.480
funny man.

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.850
So we went there.

00:18:59.850 --> 00:19:04.790
Now this, on the way, on the left-hand side
of that road there were some little houses

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.650
from where little, little children – Japanese,
very sweet children – came up to see.

00:19:08.650 --> 00:19:12.020
And they just rushed to Me, and I was playing
with them.

00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:17.650
Suddenly, one child looked up and this one
was there and she started, “Aah, heh, heh,

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:23.250
heh!” And all everybody, “Aah, heh, heh!”
– they all ran away! So we caught hold of

00:19:23.250 --> 00:19:27.180
the child, I said, “Why are you running
away?” So he said something in Japanese,

00:19:27.180 --> 00:19:29.950
so I asked the interpreter what it is.

00:19:29.950 --> 00:19:34.190
She said, “I’ll tell You later, but let
the child go away."

00:19:34.190 --> 00:19:36.140
Then I asked, “What was the child saying?”

00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:37.670
“That she’s a witch."

00:19:37.670 --> 00:19:43.670
And this lady had spent so much money, three
hours dressing up herself – I don’t know

00:19:43.670 --> 00:19:47.850
what she was looking like, but the child … “She’s
a witch!”, you see, they all ran away.

00:19:47.850 --> 00:19:52.060
And this child was pulling himself saying
that but I couldn’t know what was that!

00:19:52.060 --> 00:19:57.820
So, this is it: so-called beauty of men and
women is vanity.

00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:08.730
Their houses, their possessions, their positions
– all this pride is nonsense.

00:20:08.730 --> 00:20:12.520
The one who owns something has no pride, because
he really owns, you see.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:15.000
When you really own – I mean, when you own
everything, why should you be proud?

00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:21.730
But the way we are proud of our noses and
eyes … sometimes I feel you don’t own

00:20:21.730 --> 00:20:22.730
them.

00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:28.630
I mean, if they’re a part and parcel of
your being, what is there to be proud of?

00:20:28.630 --> 00:20:31.840
So, is madha: is madha.

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:35.430
Then the third [should be 4th, see below]
one comes as matsara.

00:20:35.430 --> 00:20:44.730
Is the one – the way we are sort of impressed
by others’ things and we get jealous of

00:20:44.730 --> 00:20:45.730
other things.

00:20:45.730 --> 00:20:50.090
You see, even the jealousy can be subtler:
like if I pay attention more to someone or

00:20:50.090 --> 00:20:56.390
somebody is more allowed to come and see Me
– supposing, by any chance – then people

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:57.970
get jealous of that as well.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:05.600
On the contrary, one should know mostly I
am looking after the people who are more affected,

00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:10.980
so may be that there’s something wrong with
the person, nothing to feel jealous.

00:21:10.980 --> 00:21:17.420
So, to be jealous of such a person … so
this is – the person who comes to Me feels

00:21:17.420 --> 00:21:25.550
madha, is the pride, that he comes to Me and
the others feel jealous of him, but he is,

00:21:25.550 --> 00:21:30.450
poor thing, going down every day, and the
others are jealous of him.

00:21:30.450 --> 00:21:36.263
So, this is the thing, is matsara.

00:21:36.263 --> 00:21:42.200
So we have got, now how many I have told you?

00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:44.500
[Yogis: Four] Four.

00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:53.421
Now, another is attachment and attractions
to people; this is the worst of all because

00:21:53.421 --> 00:21:55.420
the bhoots are always combined with bhoots.

00:21:55.420 --> 00:22:03.380
You see, in a group you’ll find this group
goes together; all the bhoots of one place

00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:06.490
combine together: you can make it out.

00:22:06.490 --> 00:22:12.720
In India, when there are people of different
places, you see – Australia, England, say

00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:20.310
Switzerland … and in that also Cambridge,
Brighton … Then we can say in India also,

00:22:20.310 --> 00:22:28.300
you see, you have to come to one little … small,
little … we can say, group from [SOUNDS

00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.390
LIKE Tambarat, alright.

00:22:32.390 --> 00:22:38.930
All these, you see, you can suddenly find
them combined together, suddenly; they all

00:22:38.930 --> 00:22:40.860
sit in groups.

00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:46.540
You can immediately make out; you can say,
“Tambarat group-hood is there, and this

00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.540
group-hood is there."

00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:52.570
You see, grouping – grouping is one of the
ways people show the moha.

00:22:52.570 --> 00:23:00.520
Then it can go down: “My daughter, my son,
my this thing …” I mean, our country is

00:23:00.520 --> 00:23:04.230
the worst in this you see: “my wife, my
husband.

00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:05.410
My wife must have this."

00:23:05.410 --> 00:23:06.410
“Why?

00:23:06.410 --> 00:23:08.640
Why should your wife?” “My wife must have
a bed.

00:23:08.640 --> 00:23:10.610
My wife must have a …” Why?

00:23:10.610 --> 00:23:11.610
Why?

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.510
Why your wife is so special?

00:23:13.510 --> 00:23:19.170
I mean, she’s a wife like anybody else … “My
child must have this."

00:23:19.170 --> 00:23:20.170
Why?

00:23:20.170 --> 00:23:23.360
Or, “I must have this."

00:23:23.360 --> 00:23:24.750
Why?

00:23:24.750 --> 00:23:33.050
This is moha, moha – is to say that, “I
must have this for mine.

00:23:33.050 --> 00:23:34.400
My, mine."

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:40.040
First, ‘I, my, mine’ – you can put it;
three.

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:42.400
I, my, mine.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:46.030
These words should not be pronounced: it should
be ‘our’.

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:52.750
You must have noticed I say so many times,
‘I’, who is ‘Absolute I’; I am absolutely

00:23:52.750 --> 00:23:54.120
alone, single.

00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:57.820
But so many said, “Our” – I say “Our
disciples, our disciples."

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.730
Now, who are the ‘ours’?

00:23:59.730 --> 00:24:00.870
It’s Me only.

00:24:00.870 --> 00:24:02.270
Who else is there?

00:24:02.270 --> 00:24:07.420
But so many times, “Our disciples are there,
our this thing, our …

00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:13.340
“When Gregoire wrote his book, I said, “Don’t
say ‘I’, say ‘our’, ‘we’."

00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:21.210
So, you should never talk in ‘I’s but
talk in ‘We’ or at the most, if you have

00:24:21.210 --> 00:24:27.340
to talk about yourself, you should say, “this
Bala”: “This Bala wants to go."

00:24:27.340 --> 00:24:31.790
So, you are separated from Bala, in the third
person.

00:24:31.790 --> 00:24:36.710
So the ‘I’ must be dropped out and off
because you are finished with it now; that’s

00:24:36.710 --> 00:24:37.710
finished.

00:24:37.710 --> 00:24:40.240
You are no more that ‘I’ which was closed
down.

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:44.760
So no more ‘I’ exists; just try to open
out yourself, to be one with the collective.

00:24:44.760 --> 00:24:47.240
This is moha.

00:24:47.240 --> 00:24:52.050
Then it can be very subtler and subtler: “My
country."

00:24:52.050 --> 00:24:58.910
Say, to be proud of India, now I am supposed
to be born in India – sometimes I am so

00:24:58.910 --> 00:25:05.130
ashamed to be an Indian; so ashamed to be
an Indian, you can’t imagine.

00:25:05.130 --> 00:25:12.430
I mean, then I feel, if My hair were blond,
I would be a happier person.

00:25:12.430 --> 00:25:19.540
Sometimes, I’m ashamed to be British, when
I think the way they behave towards other

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.540
countries.

00:25:20.540 --> 00:25:25.840
And sometimes I’m ashamed to be a developing
country, and sometimes I’m ashamed to be

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:29.300
a developed country – because I can enter
into any personality.

00:25:29.300 --> 00:25:35.610
But I’d better try not to be any one of
these where I feel ashamed.

00:25:35.610 --> 00:25:44.470
[Mother is laughing] There are good and bad
points in everything, so why to get attached

00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:45.470
to anyone?

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:52.760
Because everybody has 50/50 percent, so no
use getting attached, you see – who is Indian

00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:56.770
and who is British: it’s made by human beings
only.

00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.050
God has not made you like that.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:05.000
He just created one world; is crazy human
beings they have done this nonsense, you see.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.590
So what is there to get attached to someone?

00:26:07.590 --> 00:26:12.130
Or detached; everyone has got good points
and bad points.

00:26:12.130 --> 00:26:21.140
So, how are you to say, “I don’t like
this man, I don’t like that man."

00:26:21.140 --> 00:26:22.140
What is there to say?

00:26:22.140 --> 00:26:27.590
I mean, if I was to say like that, as I’ve
said many a times, I would have been left

00:26:27.590 --> 00:26:35.410
high and dry! [Mother is laughing] I don’t
think I would have a single companion maybe.

00:26:35.410 --> 00:26:40.840
So, whom to discard and whom to get attached?

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.740
So this [is] moha.

00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:52.500
And another is the desire to own something,
of possessions: lobha.

00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.540
I see, say, a very nice…what is this set
is?

00:26:54.540 --> 00:26:55.540
Television?

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.540
No.

00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:57.540
Yogi: Stereo.

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:58.540
Shri Mataji: Ah?

00:26:58.540 --> 00:26:59.540
Yogi: Stereo.

00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:04.900
Shri Mataji: Stereo, stereo, very good stereo
with Bala, then I must have it!

00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:12.640
[Bala says, “It’s Yours, Mother, it’s
Yours!” All laugh.]

00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.750
I don’t know even how to operate, though
I want to use it by all means (Shri Mataji

00:27:16.750 --> 00:27:17.750
and yogis laugh).

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:18.890
You see, it’s like that.

00:27:18.890 --> 00:27:26.390
This is, is to try to have something which
you have.

00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:37.030
Say, I was coming in Tambar – I was looking
out, what should I buy from Tambar?

00:27:37.030 --> 00:27:38.030
So, why?

00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.170
What is the purpose?

00:27:41.170 --> 00:27:45.860
I bought two things with – Philip, you remember?

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:48.660
He might have forgotten.

00:27:48.660 --> 00:27:58.010
We went to that shop, because that place,
these things has been looked by many people

00:27:58.010 --> 00:27:59.150
have seen this.

00:27:59.150 --> 00:28:02.280
It’s a beautiful thing, has good vibrations.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:10.520
So, through those things, I can put My attention
onto the people who live there.

00:28:10.520 --> 00:28:16.430
So I always go and purchase something from
a shop there, somewhere, which was on the

00:28:16.430 --> 00:28:23.380
outside where people were seeing it, you see:
they were coming, going, seeing, and their

00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:25.160
attention has been there.

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:29.830
So through that I can work out My attention
on these people who have put attention on

00:28:29.830 --> 00:28:31.840
a thing.

00:28:31.840 --> 00:28:40.380
That’s matter, and that is how a matter
is useful; without matter, God cannot manifest.

00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:46.510
He had to materialize Himself also in a form
to talk to you.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:55.100
And there has to be a form through which He
has to act and that’s how I have to get

00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.270
something like that.

00:28:56.270 --> 00:29:03.060
But when I find that this is all right, I’ve
used it, then I’m not attached; I give up

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.060
anything.

00:29:04.060 --> 00:29:05.060
You like it?

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:08.790
All right, have it, just have it!

00:29:08.790 --> 00:29:21.330
When I have it with Me, I use it for a purpose,
and when I want to use it for someone, then

00:29:21.330 --> 00:29:25.650
I’m generous, then I say, “All right,
have it."

00:29:25.650 --> 00:29:29.010
I use it for My generosity, in both ways.

00:29:29.010 --> 00:29:35.020
So, if you want to possess something – to
have an attraction for something that you

00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:42.020
want to have – it should not be for your
self-indulgence, but for using it for your

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:43.020
generosity.

00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:51.160
Buy it for somebody, best is; never buy anything
for yourself, should be the principle to begin

00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:52.160
with.

00:29:52.160 --> 00:29:56.870
And do not … now supposing you say, is of
course, this is very nice, “I must buy this

00:29:56.870 --> 00:30:01.391
for X, Y, Z,” – somebody else, another
Sahaja Yogi – how many would come forward

00:30:01.391 --> 00:30:02.391
to buy?

00:30:02.391 --> 00:30:09.710
It’s for yourself and who?

00:30:09.710 --> 00:30:19.170
Now let us see from our budget how much do
we spend for buying things for others, apart

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:29.270
from Mother; Mother you would, but apart from
Mother.

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:32.210
All right?

00:30:32.210 --> 00:30:39.110
So, this is how we should get rid of our moha.

00:30:39.110 --> 00:30:50.720
Enjoy [INAUDIBLE, sound cuts out] neutralizing
thing is there – enjoy what you give and

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.350
do not enjoy what you possess: is the best
way to enjoy your generosity, and then you’ll

00:30:57.350 --> 00:31:00.680
be amazed that you will rise.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.440
Now, this is all for your own ascent; most
selfish thing I’m teaching.

00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:14.740
This is the most selfish things, as you can
say, swartha – swartha is called as, if

00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:20.200
translated directly, it means selfishness
– but ‘swa arth’.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:30.300
‘Swa arth’ means …meaning of your Swa
is your Self; Sanskrit language very clever.

00:31:30.300 --> 00:31:35.350
Selfishness itself means a self-fish, see?

00:31:35.350 --> 00:31:42.020
Even there is Self – I don’t know why
fish.

00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:52.500
But – in English language I don’t know
– but in India fish is shubha – auspicious.

00:31:52.500 --> 00:32:02.660
So selfish must be meaning that it should
be auspicious for your Self: self- fish.

00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:11.380
But if the Self is all right, and the fish
is smelling or rotting, then it becomes self-fish

00:32:11.380 --> 00:32:13.020
– dirty one, isn’t it?

00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:21.120
That’s what it is, but it must be the meaning
is auspiciousness for your Self.

00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:28.270
So, this is the real selfishness, if you like
the word.

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:34.770
This is for your good, that we must be careful
about, that we are always attacked on our

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:39.380
weaknesses and not on our strong points.

00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:48.160
We should never be identified with our weaknesses;
never justify them.

00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:55.780
Never justify them; otherwise they will go
deeper and deeper and deeper.

00:32:55.780 --> 00:33:03.120
Otherwise, one man will say, “Oh, is I am
so … I give up."

00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.700
It’s all right, that’s the thing Sahaja
Yoga is doing all the time; you don’t know

00:33:08.700 --> 00:33:13.610
if there’s a circle going on.

00:33:13.610 --> 00:33:16.040
You are thrown out of Sahaja Yoga circle.

00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.870
And you’ll be thrown out just like that,
like a tangent you’ll go away and you’ll

00:33:19.870 --> 00:33:23.090
never return back, and then where you will
go, God alone knows.

00:33:23.090 --> 00:33:25.650
As it is, who are you without Sahaja Yoga,
just think of it.

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:26.650
What is your identity?

00:33:26.650 --> 00:33:31.340
You are nothing.

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:41.090
So, one has to remember that not to praise
your weaknesses, not to support them but to

00:33:41.090 --> 00:33:42.410
be looking after it.

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:52.810
Now, a person who has a particular weakness
– for example, say of … we can say a very

00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:56.940
mild one, like is of keeping Mataji’s photographs;
see, a simple thing.

00:33:56.940 --> 00:34:06.480
“After all, Mataji’s photographs are there,
why not I keep to myself?” Even, such a

00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:15.090
subtle thing is a weakness: Mataji’s photographs
are to be enjoyed by everyone.

00:34:15.090 --> 00:34:18.280
Your possessions are to be enjoyed by everyone.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:27.070
There’s nothing like private in Sahaja Yoga,
that you enjoy – even your wife is to be

00:34:27.070 --> 00:34:31.470
enjoyed by everyone as a mother.

00:34:31.470 --> 00:34:37.480
Even your husband is to be enjoyed as a father
by everyone.

00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:47.980
Relationship may change, but we should allow
our homes, houses, everything, to be enjoyed

00:34:47.980 --> 00:34:49.550
by everyone.

00:34:49.550 --> 00:34:57.971
Now, if both are Sahaja Yogis, there should
be no problem; if one is a Sahaja Yogi, then

00:34:57.971 --> 00:34:58.971
I can understand.

00:34:58.971 --> 00:35:03.770
If one is a Sahaja Yogi and the other is not
a Sahaja Yogi, then it’s a big problem,

00:35:03.770 --> 00:35:12.280
all right; because the possessions belong
to one person and another person is not a

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.550
Sahaja Yogi, then it’s very difficult.

00:35:15.550 --> 00:35:21.090
But, when both are Sahaja Yogis, then there
should be no problem – is to be enjoyed

00:35:21.090 --> 00:35:31.120
by everyone; there’s no objection on that
point.

00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:40.260
Once you realize this point, that you will
be attacked on your weaknesses, you’ll be

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:48.030
very cautious and careful about your weaknesses;
be careful about your weaknesses, because

00:35:48.030 --> 00:35:51.190
these satanic forces are going to pull you
down.

00:35:51.190 --> 00:35:54.840
All the possessions come to you on your weaknesses.

00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.490
Now we’ll see the other side of it, the
[SOUNDS LIKE rhapani].

00:35:58.490 --> 00:36:00.670
There is one more side.

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:02.850
[They haven’t come as yet.

00:36:02.850 --> 00:36:03.850
Who?

00:36:03.850 --> 00:36:05.730
They have come?

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:08.960
Where are they?

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:16.180
They sit outside, are they listening to Me?

00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.180
Alright, good idea.

00:36:17.180 --> 00:36:18.180
I just…]

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:20.020
One more thing, one other side which I must
tell you.

00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:24.060
Now the bhoots that come into us, they come
from outside.

00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:26.320
Now this is another thing.

00:36:26.320 --> 00:36:28.580
Despite our [UNCLEAR] they’re outside.

00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:33.700
The bhoots that come from outside, how to
save yourself; they also, if they have come

00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:36.990
through gurus, then I have told you how to
get rid of it – must go on saying, “Mother,

00:36:36.990 --> 00:36:44.500
You are my Guru, You are my Guru, I am my
own Guru, I have nothing to do with that”,

00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:46.940
you know all that.

00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.810
So try to work it out; certain gurus have
got their own names as rakshasas, you should

00:36:50.810 --> 00:36:56.620
know to get rid of them, and beat them out,
and that’s how you can work it out.

00:36:56.620 --> 00:37:05.040
They also work on your weaknesses of, say,
somebody wants to be a great leader in Sahaja

00:37:05.040 --> 00:37:08.200
Yoga, they’ll come: outside.

00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:12.070
Somebody wants to be obstinate, they’ll
come.

00:37:12.070 --> 00:37:15.990
Somebody wants to be showing off, they will
come.

00:37:15.990 --> 00:37:22.880
Now, they can become very subtler, you see,
there’s someone who’s talking ill about

00:37:22.880 --> 00:37:27.050
Sahaja Yoga or even slightest doubt, never
listen to that; never talk to that person:

00:37:27.050 --> 00:37:28.550
that person is possessed.

00:37:28.550 --> 00:37:31.480
What is there to doubt Sahaja Yoga?

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:32.480
What is there to doubt?

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:36.840
It’s more than sunshine: there’s nothing
to doubt about Sahaja Yoga.

00:37:36.840 --> 00:37:40.360
Anybody who doubts, you just say, “I have
nothing to do, I don’t want to talk to you,”

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:45.150
because he is possessed; anybody who is not
surrendered to Sahaja Yoga or to Me, you are

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.900
not to look at that person.

00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:52.770
Have nothing to do with that person, just
get out of it: “Nothing doing, we don’t

00:37:52.770 --> 00:37:54.340
want this filth."

00:37:54.340 --> 00:37:57.090
That person will improve, and you’ll improve
also.

00:37:57.090 --> 00:38:03.440
But, if you allow that person, you see, to
come round, and talk to you, be sweet to you,

00:38:03.440 --> 00:38:07.270
then don’t talk against Sahaja Yogis, “We
have seen the light, you have not seen the

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:08.270
light, so shut up.

00:38:08.270 --> 00:38:09.920
We don’t want to hear a single word of it."

00:38:09.920 --> 00:38:15.220
It’s like sunshine: we have seen it, it
has worked with us.

00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:20.990
Those who are doubting people, have nothing
to do with them and you will be amazed how

00:38:20.990 --> 00:38:25.580
you will be saved.

00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:29.040
Anyone who says, “Now I will have nothing
to do with Sahaja Yoga”, you say, “Get

00:38:29.040 --> 00:38:31.630
out! Immediately you’d better not do it,”
is the best.

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:37.880
“Leave us, spare us, get out."

00:38:37.880 --> 00:38:41.280
Anybody who tries to show we are… “Oh,
I need all the sympathies of the world,”

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:47.110
and all that – some people are like that,
“Oh, I was about to commit suicide …” Tell

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:49.110
them to commit suicide immediately.

00:38:49.110 --> 00:38:57.730
Do not play into the sympathies of the people
also, you see these are how the bhoots come

00:38:57.730 --> 00:38:59.780
in – “Oh, I am very sick you know, I deserve
this, that …” “All right, go to Mother;

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:04.510
use photograph, do this, but we are not going
to cure you, nothing doing."

00:39:04.510 --> 00:39:08.160
Because if you start curing a person, you’ll
get sick yourself and you will have a problem

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:13.240
for your Mother; it has happened with so many
people.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:16.730
Recently there was a case, and a lady was
trying to commit suicide.

00:39:16.730 --> 00:39:25.230
I told them, “You’d better tell to commit
suicide,” and she was shocked.

00:39:25.230 --> 00:39:30.200
Because, you see, this is a very subtle thing
that we want to be compassionate.

00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:33.210
Are you more compassionate than God is?

00:39:33.210 --> 00:39:34.210
Are you?

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:35.530
You are not.

00:39:35.530 --> 00:39:42.869
Let it to happen through God; you just don’t
try to help a person to get cured; none of

00:39:42.869 --> 00:39:44.930
you should try.

00:39:44.930 --> 00:39:47.470
I will tell you when you have to do that,
not now.

00:39:47.470 --> 00:39:53.420
Just now, you people do not try to cure people;
if somebody wants cure, all right, you can

00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:58.070
vibrate the lemons and give them – that
much you can do, you have that much power.

00:39:58.070 --> 00:40:02.970
You can vibrate the water and give, because
you are Yogis, no doubt.

00:40:02.970 --> 00:40:05.440
But you do not personally touch that person.

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:08.190
Please do not do it.

00:40:08.190 --> 00:40:15.380
You’ll be affected, and very badly affected:
some of them are suffering from horrible diseases

00:40:15.380 --> 00:40:20.190
and, if these diseases grow into you, you
would not know how to control it.

00:40:20.190 --> 00:40:27.140
So please do not try to check them or do anything
– give them a photograph if you want; they

00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:30.630
can use the photograph, ask them to sit in
the water.

00:40:30.630 --> 00:40:34.420
After using the photograph, tell them to keep
the photographs to themselves: do not take

00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:35.660
it back.

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:42.090
Be careful on this point so that they do not
attack you; this is one way they attack you.

00:40:42.090 --> 00:40:47.460
Then, a person who is very hot-tempered, better
recede from such a person because, if you

00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:50.160
try to argue with that person, you’ll get
the bhoots upon yourself.

00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.940
If somebody is angry, you say, “You are
heated."

00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:58.430
Finished; don’t talk, just don’t talk
to that person, have nothing to do.

00:40:58.430 --> 00:41:00.430
Because you get the bhoots upon yourself,
you see.

00:41:00.430 --> 00:41:04.010
You are not to neutralize such a person, just
get out of it.

00:41:04.010 --> 00:41:09.970
Try to remember what I have said to you, that
you are not to go on fighting or arguing with

00:41:09.970 --> 00:41:13.750
anyone whatsoever; if somebody is argumentative,
let him be argumentative.

00:41:13.750 --> 00:41:14.750
Do not go and argue; you

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:21.460
can tell Me about it, I’ll treat that person,
all right.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:26.320
You should not take things into your hands:
God is operating His own Laws, you should

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:32.520
not take His Laws into your hands and start
operating.

00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:39.120
First of all, one should know either you are
attacked from the Left or the Right – the

00:41:39.120 --> 00:41:45.900
Right people are the ones who come and attack
you by their operation; with such people you

00:41:45.900 --> 00:41:48.240
just “Shut up!” from them and they’ll
be all right.

00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:52.410
If they’re left alone, they will know what
they are.

00:41:52.410 --> 00:41:59.090
They talk loudly, assertively and all that
… just keep them out; don’t have a relationship

00:41:59.090 --> 00:42:00.270
with them.

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:06.190
Obstinacy: some person is a very obstinate
person – just give up, give up.

00:42:06.190 --> 00:42:10.550
You have not to cure them, you have not to
save them, you have not to achieve anything.

00:42:10.550 --> 00:42:14.390
If they are obstinate, you are obstinate,
finished: you have nothing to do with them.

00:42:14.390 --> 00:42:19.770
You go ahead: what’s the use of getting
stuck with an obstinate man or an obstinate

00:42:19.770 --> 00:42:20.770
woman?

00:42:20.770 --> 00:42:25.080
This is what one has to realize and one has
to go further with it.

00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:31.330
Now, you think about it, you will get the
inspiration and you will know how to manage

00:42:31.330 --> 00:42:36.140
these negative forces away from you.

00:42:36.140 --> 00:42:42.630
Avoid all external attachments that you have:
like somebody is very much used to TV – better

00:42:42.630 --> 00:42:43.810
not see.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.940
Somebody used to so much cinemas: better not
see.

00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:48.970
Somebody used to this: better not do it.

00:42:48.970 --> 00:42:50.960
Gradually, you will find you will be very
discriminate.

00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.220
For example, I don’t normally like sopranos
very much – the way they go on … “Hoh,

00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:59.850
hoh, hoh …” All sopranos are not good,
but there’s so many, like Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,

00:42:59.850 --> 00:43:02.430
have you heard of her?

00:43:02.430 --> 00:43:07.570
Oh, she’s a genius, she’s a genius, I
tell you.

00:43:07.570 --> 00:43:10.660
Oh, what a beauty she is.

00:43:10.660 --> 00:43:18.570
So, then the thing – everyone who is a Sahaja
Yogi is not good, and you need not bother

00:43:18.570 --> 00:43:26.050
about every Sahaja Yogi: keep company with
the people who are good Sahaja Yogis, who

00:43:26.050 --> 00:43:29.780
are surrendered, who are humble, who are collective.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:34.780
Start forming a group of Mother; this is My
group, which is absolutely surrendered to

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:40.280
Me, and those who are not bothered about other
things.

00:43:40.280 --> 00:43:46.740
Such a group should be formed, gradually this
group will gather and this surrendered group

00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:52.360
will come together, and you’ll be amazed
– we’ll create a beautiful world.

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:59.790
This is how it should work out; try to keep
to people who talk good of Sahaja Yoga, who

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:04.430
talk about Sahaja Yoga, who think about Sahaja
Yoga, who work out Sahaja Yoga, and a group

00:44:04.430 --> 00:44:05.470
can be formed.

00:44:05.470 --> 00:44:07.680
And forget all others; just forget.

00:44:07.680 --> 00:44:13.950
You have no duty to them, you owe no relationship
to them: you are here for Sahaja Yoga and

00:44:13.950 --> 00:44:18.630
you are not going to sacrifice it for anything
whatsoever.

00:44:18.630 --> 00:44:23.450
Because, you see, such a person will have
something – for example, a man like this

00:44:23.450 --> 00:44:30.420
will have a car, and you have a convenience
to travel by car, so you stick onto that man.

00:44:30.420 --> 00:44:34.780
May have a house; they will give you a house
to live in – all right, you’ll stick onto

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.780
that person.

00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:40.330
Some sort of more material convenience such
a person will have, and you will just stick

00:44:40.330 --> 00:44:43.790
onto that person because you have that material
convenience.

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:49.240
So be careful: though he talks ill about Sahaja
Yoga, doesn’t matter, “But you know he’s

00:44:49.240 --> 00:44:50.930
little nice, he’s generous."

00:44:50.930 --> 00:44:55.190
Supposing he lends you money, oh, then “He’s
nice."

00:44:55.190 --> 00:44:56.190
.

00:44:56.190 --> 00:44:58.410
No! Some sort of a thing, I’m saying: some
snag is there.

00:44:58.410 --> 00:45:01.570
So, be careful about it; some material advantage
will be there.

00:45:01.570 --> 00:45:05.140
Doesn’t matter, you can walk, you can take
a bus, doesn’t matter.

00:45:05.140 --> 00:45:10.190
So, because of this material comfort, you
might, you might fall for it, so be careful

00:45:10.190 --> 00:45:18.090
on that point – that all these bhoots are
material and they attack on your material

00:45:18.090 --> 00:45:19.090
attachments.

00:45:19.090 --> 00:45:28.280
And see to it that you get rid of those material
attachments.

00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:38.060
In one word is that, see your material attachments
and the things that, so-called, comfort you.

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:41.290
You should only seek the comfort of your Self.

00:45:41.290 --> 00:45:45.860
And only the praise of your Mother is going
to comfort your Self, take it from Me, which

00:45:45.860 --> 00:45:48.010
is told by Adi Shankaracharya long time back.

00:45:48.010 --> 00:45:53.930
And I wish you would understand that, that
there’s nothing else that is going to comfort

00:45:53.930 --> 00:45:54.930
your soul.

00:45:54.930 --> 00:46:00.610
Forget all about these things, even if you
have to walk – go on singing the praise,

00:46:00.610 --> 00:46:01.610
finished.

00:46:01.610 --> 00:46:06.230
You’ll not feel anything, that’s how it
is going to work out.

00:46:06.230 --> 00:46:12.340
Today is the day for Me to declare certain
things – as Krishna has said that, “Surrender

00:46:12.340 --> 00:46:13.340
your Self."

00:46:13.340 --> 00:46:15.580
“Sarva-dharmān parityajya mām ekaṁ
śaraṇaṁ vraja”.

00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:20.910
“Give up all other attachments and religions”
– religions means the temperaments that

00:46:20.910 --> 00:46:24.410
svabhava, the ones you have developed – “and
surrender unto Me”.

00:46:24.410 --> 00:46:26.990
Surrender unto Me, surrender unto Me.

00:46:26.990 --> 00:46:33.510
This is what you have to understand, otherwise
it’s not going to work out – haphazard

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:37.780
ways, half ways – it’s not going to work
out.

00:46:37.780 --> 00:46:38.780
This, if you learn, you have solved the problem.

00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:46.500
We should not do during the Puja – after
the Puja we’ll have the photographs so that

00:46:46.500 --> 00:46:50.310
you concentrate on the Puja, all right?

00:46:50.310 --> 00:46:58.000
Now today, because it is a Krishna’s Jayanti,
I thought that we should have a Gita for you,

00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:06.880
and I’ve told him to read Gita, so that
when all these things are done, your attention

00:47:06.880 --> 00:47:09.380
should be on Gita, what he reads.

00:47:09.380 --> 00:47:12.310
He has to read it loudly and …

00:47:12.310 --> 00:47:15.630
Where is the water?

00:47:15.630 --> 00:47:24.470
No, not that, for washing the Feet.

00:47:24.470 --> 00:47:30.452
Now put the three leaves.

00:47:30.452 --> 00:47:33.650
You see, you put the three leaves.

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:42.650
Big leaves, under that, under that, under
the kumbha.

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:46.630
No, no, under the coconut.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:57.910
Other way round, under the coconut.

00:47:57.910 --> 00:47:59.430
I

00:47:59.430 --> 00:48:03.320
think too big are alright, these ones are
alright.

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:10.400
Three ones, yes, these dark, dark ones are
alright, three.

00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:26.370
Yes now, put it on top here.

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:34.869
Now, before he reads Gita, I will tell you
the basics of these two chapters which one

00:48:34.869 --> 00:48:36.200
should understand.

00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:40.200
Is, first is Sankhya yoga, Sankhya.

00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:49.040
Sankhya means Sahaja Yoga, we can say, but
Sahaja Yoga is a combination of Karma Yoga

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:51.650
and Sankhya Yoga: is both.

00:48:51.650 --> 00:48:58.510
The first part of Sankhya Yoga… The first
part of Sahaja Yoga is that you get your Realization.

00:48:58.510 --> 00:49:05.840
That means your awareness is to be enlightened,
you should have the knowledge to begin with:

00:49:05.840 --> 00:49:09.030
that is Sankhya Yoga, that you meditate and
you achieve your Realization is the first

00:49:09.030 --> 00:49:10.700
part, is Sankhya Yog.

00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:14.910
That is the first thing Krishna has said that
you achieve.

00:49:14.910 --> 00:49:22.050
Then the Karma Yoga is – actually should
start after that.

00:49:22.050 --> 00:49:24.550
That is Karma Yoga.

00:49:24.550 --> 00:49:29.370
And whatever He said about Karma Yoga is actually
after Sankhya Yoga has to be [there].

00:49:29.370 --> 00:49:34.140
Sankhya Yoga is the first thing He preached
and then He said about Karma Yoga; that you

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:36.340
cannot do Karma Yoga before Sankhy.

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:37.340
Yog.

00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.640
But this is a trick of Shri Krishna.

00:49:39.640 --> 00:49:47.700
So, those who try to do Karma Yoga before
Sankhya Yoga are mistaken people.

00:49:47.700 --> 00:49:54.330
Moreover, He has tried to show that there
are no two things: they are one.

00:49:54.330 --> 00:50:02.090
But they get two, become two because, if you
put the Karma Yoga first, and then the Sankhya

00:50:02.090 --> 00:50:09.410
Yoga, it would be like, say a telephone which
is not connected: you go on telephoning.

00:50:09.410 --> 00:50:10.410
That

00:50:10.410 --> 00:50:15.290
telephoning is Karma Yoga and then you’
do the connection, so this is wasted, and

00:50:15.290 --> 00:50:16.290
that is wasted.

00:50:16.290 --> 00:50:27.700
So what you do is to first of all connect,
and then you do the Karma Yoga, so both things

00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:28.970
become one.

00:50:28.970 --> 00:50:30.230
All right?

00:50:30.230 --> 00:50:36.810
Once you understand that without connection,
you cannot see your Ego, you cannot see your

00:50:36.810 --> 00:50:40.560
Super-ego, you’ll go on with your ego all
the time, and you’re not aware of it at

00:50:40.560 --> 00:50:41.560
all.

00:50:41.560 --> 00:50:48.860
I mean, with Sahaja Yoga also you do, but
with Sahaja Yoga at least you get aware of

00:50:48.860 --> 00:50:51.600
your Ego, you get aware of your Super-ego.

00:50:51.600 --> 00:51:00.290
So, first you do Sankhya Yog and then Karma
Yog, is the thing that He’s trying to say

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:05.150
and, whatever He has said in Karma Yoga is
after Realization, after Sankhya Yoga.

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:08.600
So, first He talked of Sankhya Yoga then [UNCLEAR].

00:51:08.600 --> 00:51:16.730
Now, He says that those who talk of them separate
are not wise, that’s how He neutralizes.

00:51:16.730 --> 00:51:24.010
But He has created this mystery 6.000 years
back, because He wanted people to go around

00:51:24.010 --> 00:51:25.010
the world, you see?

00:51:25.010 --> 00:51:28.160
Because they wouldn’t understand; let them
telephoning – go on telephoning, telephoning,

00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:29.160
telephoning.

00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:32.460
If you tell them, “Don’t do it,” they’ll
be angry: their ego will come up.

00:51:32.460 --> 00:51:36.650
So He said, “All right, go on telephoning,
telephoning, telephoning, then when you’ll

00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:41.310
be tired, you don’t get any connection,
then you’ll come back and you’ll say,

00:51:41.310 --> 00:51:43.301
‘Mother, it has not worked out’, then
the Mother will be here and She’ll tell

00:51:43.301 --> 00:51:44.760
the Truth."

00:51:44.760 --> 00:51:53.369
That’s why these six thousand years you
have been telephoning, telephoning, telephoning.

00:51:53.369 --> 00:52:00.160
And that telephoning is Bhakti Yoga but that
is, comes the third stage.

00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:07.619
First you get your Realization, secondly you
work it out, perfect it and then indulge into

00:52:07.619 --> 00:52:09.600
Bhakti, into joy.

00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:19.290
Now, these are in three stages: first you
get your knowledge – means your intelligence

00:52:19.290 --> 00:52:24.890
on your brain and that part, the Virata, [UNCLEAR
Sanskrit?].

00:52:24.890 --> 00:52:31.250
Means you achieve the Sat; Sat part of it
– the Truth.

00:52:31.250 --> 00:52:35.540
Then second, you do the attention: Chitta
– action.

00:52:35.540 --> 00:52:38.250
That’s Karma Yoga.

00:52:38.250 --> 00:52:42.540
And third, you do Bhakti, is the joy.

00:52:42.540 --> 00:52:46.640
Enjoy: you sing and praise, that’s all.

00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:48.790
Is combined like that.

00:52:48.790 --> 00:52:53.980
So, He has put three things – actually they
are one, stage by stage.

00:52:53.980 --> 00:52:56.540
But for befooling people, He said, “You
can do anything before” – I don’t know

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:59.540
if He has said it, but He might have said
it: He’s very clever.

00:52:59.540 --> 00:53:00.540
So what to do?

00:53:00.540 --> 00:53:02.450
People don’t want to take by stages, you
see.

00:53:02.450 --> 00:53:08.010
They want to do first of all; I have seen
many people who would like to ‘do’ Sahaja

00:53:08.010 --> 00:53:10.630
Yoga more than achieve it.

00:53:10.630 --> 00:53:17.860
All right, so now in these two chapters, you
will find out.

00:53:17.860 --> 00:53:24.480
Now, when He says “Yogi”, it means Sahaja
Yogi, all right?

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.890
Now, can somebody – who is going to wash
My feet today?

00:53:28.890 --> 00:53:31.070
Somebody from here.

00:53:31.070 --> 00:53:37.790
Now you need not, we have just now in My presence.

00:53:37.790 --> 00:53:39.080
Now please don’t pay attention to yourself.

00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.170
(Inaudible because some sound covers the voice).

00:53:41.170 --> 00:53:42.800
But surrender yourself.

00:53:42.800 --> 00:53:43.800
Alright?

00:53:43.800 --> 00:53:44.800
Now.

00:53:44.800 --> 00:53:47.160
Now, who is from this place?

00:53:47.160 --> 00:53:48.240
Come along.

00:53:48.240 --> 00:53:49.880
Now, who else?

00:53:49.880 --> 00:53:52.340
Come forward, come along, come along.

00:53:52.340 --> 00:53:54.800
Rachel and all these people.

00:53:54.800 --> 00:53:55.800
Come along.

00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:56.940
Where is your

00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:57.940
husband?

00:53:57.940 --> 00:53:58.940
Come, you should sit forward.

00:53:58.940 --> 00:53:59.940
Come along, come along, come along.

00:53:59.940 --> 00:54:02.450
All of you should be in front.

00:54:02.450 --> 00:54:21.010
Come forward, you come forward all

00:54:21.010 --> 00:54:29.380
of you, you all come forward.

00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:45.080
Specially those who have not yet washed My
feet and all that should be forward.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:47.700
Come along.

00:54:47.700 --> 00:54:51.950
I would suggest that let somebody else, let
Warren read it.

00:54:51.950 --> 00:54:54.970
Alright, and you do the washing and all.

00:54:54.970 --> 00:54:56.190
Come along.

00:54:56.190 --> 00:54:57.420
Use that.

00:54:57.420 --> 00:54:59.860
Come along Warren, come.

00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:08.390
It is to be – it’s in English language,
it’s alright.

00:55:08.390 --> 00:55:11.300
Do it loudly.

00:55:11.300 --> 00:55:13.890
You missed time there, or somewhere?

00:55:13.890 --> 00:55:16.560
(Warren: “Chapter four and five, ok?

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:17.630
Chapter four and five’.

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:18.630
)

00:55:18.630 --> 00:55:21.650
Shri Mataji: You can stand there, on the top
of that, I don’t want to… yes, on the

00:55:21.650 --> 00:55:28.800
green one.

00:55:28.800 --> 00:55:35.330
(…) Now listen to him, that’s very important.

00:55:35.330 --> 00:55:39.580
Now, those people who are here….

00:55:39.580 --> 00:55:40.580
Chaya?

00:55:40.580 --> 00:55:41.700
It’s here.

00:55:41.700 --> 00:55:43.820
Where is she?

00:55:43.820 --> 00:55:44.820
Alright.

00:55:44.820 --> 00:55:46.960
No, where will you throw it?

00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:51.900
(Yogi: We are going to wash it onto the tree.)
Shri Mataji: Alright, come along.

00:55:51.900 --> 00:55:52.900
Little more.

00:55:52.900 --> 00:55:56.090
Now you read it, fourth chapter and fifth.

00:55:56.090 --> 00:55:59.100
[Warren starts reading, Shri Mataji sometimes
comments some parts while Her feet are being

00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:00.100
washed]

00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:01.280
Chapter 4:
Warren: Shri Bhagavan said: I taught this

00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:04.470
immortal yoga to Vivasvan, the sun god.

00:56:04.470 --> 00:56:06.710
Shri Mataji: “Sun God.

00:56:06.710 --> 00:56:09.510
Now who is ‘Sun God’?

00:56:09.510 --> 00:56:11.200
You know Christ."

00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:19.920
Warren: Vivaswan conveyed it to Manu, his
son, and Manu imparted it to his son, Isvaku.

00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:29.660
Thus handed down from father to son, Arjuna,
this yoga remained known to the Raja Rishis.

00:56:29.660 --> 00:56:34.720
By great influx of time, however, it has more
or less disappeared.

00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:40.190
The same ancient yoga as this has been imparted
to you by Me because you are My devotee and

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:42.460
friend, and also because this is a supreme
secret.

00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:47.570
Shri Mataji: Now see, He told it to only Arjuna,
to nobody else.

00:56:47.570 --> 00:56:49.840
This is not a mass thing, it’s only individualistic.

00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:56.430
Warren: Arjuna said: “You are of recent
origin, while the birth of Vivaswan…”

00:56:56.430 --> 00:57:03.190
Shri Mataji: “This is quite a, quite a common
thought – ‘You are a recent origin’.

00:57:03.190 --> 00:57:05.780
Me too, they think so."

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.109
Warren: …while the birth of Vivaswan dates
back to antiquity.

00:57:10.109 --> 00:57:15.700
How then am I to understand that you taught
at the beginning of creation?”

00:57:15.700 --> 00:57:23.520
Shri Bhagavan said: “Arjuna, you and I have
passed through many births.

00:57:23.520 --> 00:57:28.900
I know them all, while you do not, O chastiser
of foes.

00:57:28.900 --> 00:57:35.400
Though unborn and immortal, also the Lord
of all beings, I manifest Myself through My

00:57:35.400 --> 00:57:38.970
own Yogamaya, or divine potency, keeping My
nature…

00:57:38.970 --> 00:57:44.180
Shri Mataji: “Where ‘I’ is, you should
know this is Me, all right?

00:57:44.180 --> 00:57:45.640
Then you’ll understand."

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:50.900
Warren: … keeping My nature completely under
control.

00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:57.570
Arjuna, whenever there is decline of righteousness
and unrighteousness is in the ascendant, then

00:57:57.570 --> 00:58:00.510
I body Myself forth.

00:58:00.510 --> 00:58:01.510
For the protection

00:58:01.510 --> 00:58:07.210
of the virtuous, for the destruction of the
evil-doers, and for the establishment of Dharma

00:58:07.210 --> 00:58:11.610
on a firm footing I am born again from age
to age.

00:58:11.610 --> 00:58:18.050
Arjuna, My birth and activities are divine,
he who knows this in reality does not take

00:58:18.050 --> 00:58:23.210
birth again on leaving his body but attains
Me.

00:58:23.210 --> 00:58:28.210
Completely rid of passion, fear and anger,
wholly absorbed in Me, depending on Me and

00:58:28.210 --> 00:58:36.110
purified by the penance of wisdom, many have
become one with Me…

00:58:36.110 --> 00:58:50.120
Warren: … purified by the penance of wisdom,
many have become one with Me even in the past.

00:58:50.120 --> 00:58:58.250
Arjuna, howsoever men approach Me, even so
do I seek them, for all men follow My path

00:58:58.250 --> 00:59:00.510
from all sides.

00:59:00.510 --> 00:59:06.990
In this mortal world, men seeking the fruition
of their activities worship the gods, so success

00:59:06.990 --> 00:59:11.170
born of action follows quickly.

00:59:11.170 --> 00:59:21.140
The four orders of society, namely the Brahman,
the Khatriya, the Vaisyas and the Sudra were

00:59:21.140 --> 00:59:25.200
created classifying them according to their
prenatal qualities…

00:59:25.200 --> 00:59:32.050
Shri Mataji:- That’s their aptitudes, aptitudes.
Warren: And apportioning corresponding duties

00:59:32.050 --> 00:59:35.190
to them.
Shri Mataji: Brahmanas are the ones who are

00:59:35.190 --> 00:59:36.190
seekers of God.

00:59:36.190 --> 00:59:42.450
Warren: “Though the author of this creation,
know Me, the immortal Lord, to be a non-doer.

00:59:42.450 --> 00:59:49.760
Since I have no cravings for the fruits of
actions, actions do not contaminate Me.

00:59:49.760 --> 00:59:54.750
Even he who does know Me, in reality is not
bound by actions.

00:59:54.750 --> 00:59:59.710
Having known thus, action was performed even
by the ancient seekers of salvation.

00:59:59.710 --> 01:00:06.340
Therefore, do you also perform such actions
as were performed by the ancients in the former

01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:07.420
times.

01:00:07.420 --> 01:00:12.500
Even the wise are at a loss to know what is
action and what is inaction.

01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:18.570
Therefore I shall expound to you the truth
about action, knowing which you will be freed

01:00:18.570 --> 01:00:19.770
from its evil effects.

01:00:19.770 --> 01:00:23.370
Shri Mataji: “Now this is after Realization,
you try to understand.

01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:24.370
So."

01:00:24.370 --> 01:00:28.110
Warren: The truth about action must be known,
and the truth of prohibited action must also

01:00:28.110 --> 01:00:29.180
be known.

01:00:29.180 --> 01:00:31.920
Even so the truth about inaction must be known.

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.740
So the mysterious are the ways of action.

01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:42.260
He who sees inaction in action and action
in inaction is wise among men.

01:00:42.260 --> 01:00:47.619
He is a yogi who has accomplished all action.

01:00:47.619 --> 01:00:52.380
He whose undertakings are all free from desire
and thoughts of the world, and whose actions

01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:59.021
are burnt up by the fire of wisdom, him even
the wise call a sage.

01:00:59.021 --> 01:01:02.640
He who having totally given up attachments
to actions and their fruits…

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.620
Shri Mataji: This is for you people.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:10.050
Warren: …has got over the dependence on
the world and is ever satisfied, does nothing

01:01:10.050 --> 01:01:17.490
at all, though he may be ever engaged in action.

01:01:17.490 --> 01:01:22.430
He who has subdued his mind and his body,
has given up all objects of enjoyment and

01:01:22.430 --> 01:01:29.859
has no cravings, performing sheer bodily action,
such a person does not incur sin.

01:01:29.859 --> 01:01:35.450
He who is contented with whatever he has got
and unsought, is free from jealous

01:01:35.450 --> 01:01:41.490
and has transcended all pairs of opposites,
such as joy and grief, and is balanced in

01:01:41.490 --> 01:01:43.270
success and failure.

01:01:43.270 --> 01:01:48.710
Such a karma yogi, though acting, is not bound.

01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:53.930
He whose attachment has gone, whose mind is
established in knowledge and who acts for

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:58.670
the sake of sacrifice, all actions of that
liberated man melt away.

01:01:58.670 --> 01:02:02.960
Shri Mataji: “‘The liberated man’: now
you see, the fools who don’t understand

01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:07.520
this – without liberation, they start doing
all this action; you cannot do it.

01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:13.609
Warren: The sacrificing which they … in
which the oblation is poured is Brahma, the

01:02:13.609 --> 01:02:18.740
oblation itself is Brahma, even so the act
of pouring the same into the fire which is

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:24.840
again Brahma, by the sacrificer who is himself
Brahma, surely is the goal to be reached by

01:02:24.840 --> 01:02:30.080
him who is absorbed in such sacrifices Brahma
is also Brahma…

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:32.600
– “Brahma is all-pervading power, you
can say."

01:02:32.600 --> 01:02:37.320
Warren: Is the absolute.
Shri Mataji: Divine love is Brahma.

01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:42.680
Warren: Other yogis offer sacrifice in the
shape of worship to the gods, others pour

01:02:42.680 --> 01:02:48.460
into the fire of Brahma, others sacrifice
in the shape of the Self, through the sacrifice

01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:52.170
known as the perception of identity.

01:02:52.170 --> 01:02:53.170
Others offer as sacrifice..

01:02:53.170 --> 01:02:55.630
Shri Mataji: Now you understand?

01:02:55.630 --> 01:03:01.700
W… others offer as sacrifice their senses
of hearing, into the fires of self-control.

01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:08.940
Other yogis again offer sound and other objects
of perception into the fires of the senses.

01:03:08.940 --> 01:03:13.830
Others sacrifice all the functions of their
senses, and functions of the vital airs into

01:03:13.830 --> 01:03:21.640
the fire of Yoga, in the shape of the self-
control, which is kindled by wisdom.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:28.670
Some perform sacrifice with material things,
some offer sacrifice in the shape of penances,

01:03:28.670 --> 01:03:34.380
others sacrifice through the practice of Yoga,
while striving souls observing austere vows

01:03:34.380 --> 01:03:38.510
perform the sacrifice of wisdom through the
study of the sacred texts.

01:03:38.510 --> 01:03:41.020
Shri Mataji: All these things you can do.

01:03:41.020 --> 01:03:48.590
Warren: Other yogis offer the prana, breath,
into the aprana, even so others the aprana

01:03:48.590 --> 01:03:49.590
into the prana.

01:03:49.590 --> 01:03:55.980
There are still others given to the practice
of pranayama, or breath control, who having

01:03:55.980 --> 01:04:01.950
regulated their diet and control the course
both of the prana and the aprana airs, pour

01:04:01.950 --> 01:04:04.890
their life-breaths into life-breaths.

01:04:04.890 --> 01:04:12.119
All these have their sins destroyed by sacrifice
and know the truth about sacrifice.

01:04:12.119 --> 01:04:18.520
Arjuna, yogis who partake of the nectar in
the form of the remains of sacrifice attain

01:04:18.520 --> 01:04:20.520
the eternal Brahma.

01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:25.530
To the man who does not offer sacrifice even
this world is not happy.

01:04:25.530 --> 01:04:29.460
How then can the other world be happy?

01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:35.310
Many such forms of sacrifice have been set
forth in detail through the mouth of the Vedas.

01:04:35.310 --> 01:04:41.200
Know them all has begotten the reactions of
the body, the mind and the senses.

01:04:41.200 --> 01:04:48.060
Thus, knowing the truth about them you shall
be freed from the bondage of karma, through

01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.859
their practice.

01:04:49.859 --> 01:04:55.290
Arjuna, sacrifice in the form of knowledge
is superior to sacrifice performed with material

01:04:55.290 --> 01:04:56.760
things.

01:04:56.760 --> 01:05:03.170
For all actions without exception culminate
in knowledge, O son of Kunthi.

01:05:03.170 --> 01:05:08.180
Attain this knowledge by all means, if you
prostrate yourself at the feet of the wise,

01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:14.869
render them all forms of service and question
them with a guiltless heart, again and again,

01:05:14.869 --> 01:05:20.109
those wise seers of truth will unfold that
knowledge to you.

01:05:20.109 --> 01:05:26.400
Arjuna, acquiring that knowledge you will
no more be subjected to delusion like this.

01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:32.770
And through it you will see all beings first
in your own Self and then in Me.

01:05:32.770 --> 01:05:38.390
Even if you are the most sinful of all sinners,
you will cross over all the sin by the raft

01:05:38.390 --> 01:05:40.100
of knowledge.

01:05:40.100 --> 01:05:46.630
For as the blazing fire reduces the fuel to
ashes, Arjuna, even so the fire of knowledge

01:05:46.630 --> 01:05:49.950
reduces all actions to ashes.

01:05:49.950 --> 01:05:53.660
In this world there is no purifier like knowledge.

01:05:53.660 --> 01:05:57.750
He who has attained purity of heart through
the practice of karma yoga, automatically

01:05:57.750 --> 01:06:02.350
realizes it in the self in course of time.

01:06:02.350 --> 01:06:07.700
He who has fully controlled his senses, is
exclusively devoted to spiritual practice

01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:11.060
and is full of faith, attains knowledge.

01:06:11.060 --> 01:06:17.650
Having gained knowledge he immediately attains
supreme peace in the form of God Realization.

01:06:17.650 --> 01:06:23.530
He who lacks discrimination, is devoid of
faith, and is possessed by doubt, is lost

01:06:23.530 --> 01:06:25.130
to the spiritual part.

01:06:25.130 --> 01:06:30.670
Shri Mataji: Here He says possessed by what
is in the Supra-conscious.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:36.710
W.: For the doubting soul in particular, there
is neither this world nor the world beyond,

01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:39.310
nor even happiness.

01:06:39.310 --> 01:06:45.920
Arjuna, he who has dedicated all his actions
to God according to the spirit of karma yoga,

01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:52.480
whose doubts have been dispelled by wisdom
and who is self-possessed, actions do not

01:06:52.480 --> 01:06:53.480
bind him.

01:06:53.480 --> 01:06:56.840
Shri Mataji: “‘Self-possessed’ – possessed
by Self."

01:06:56.840 --> 01:07:03.090
W.: Therefore Arjuna, cutting asunder with
the sword of knowledge this doubt in your

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:09.520
heart born of ignorance, establish yourself
in karma yoga, in the form of evermindedness,

01:07:09.520 --> 01:07:11.630
and stand up for the fight.

01:07:11.630 --> 01:07:13.790
Chapter five.

01:07:13.790 --> 01:07:23.710
Arjuna said: Krishna, You extol Sankhya Yoga,
the yoga of knowledge.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.060
And then the yoga of action.

01:07:25.060 --> 01:07:29.000
Pray, tell me which of the two is decidedly
better.

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:35.230
Shri Bhagavan said: the yoga of knowledge
and the yoga of action both lead to supreme

01:07:35.230 --> 01:07:36.619
bliss.

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:42.060
Of the two however the yoga of action, being
easier to practice, is superior to the yoga

01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:44.140
of knowledge.

01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:50.500
The karma yogi, who neither hates nor desires,
should be ever considered a sannyasi.

01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:56.710
For, Arjuna, he who has transcended the pairs
of opposites, is easily freed from bondage.

01:07:56.710 --> 01:08:03.750
It is the ignorant, not the wise, who say
that Sankhya Yoga and Karma Yoga are productive

01:08:03.750 --> 01:08:05.170
of divergent results.

01:08:05.170 --> 01:08:11.849
The one who is firmly established in either
gets the fruit of both, namely God Realization.

01:08:11.849 --> 01:08:16.880
Shri Mataji: Means, supposing you are Realized
a little bit, not much.

01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.650
In the sense that you haven’t touched suddenly
the highest, which happens.

01:08:24.650 --> 01:08:30.690
Most of the people that you are, it happens
that your achievement, with your Kundalini,

01:08:30.690 --> 01:08:32.710
is not of the ultimate.

01:08:32.710 --> 01:08:39.040
So, when you do Karma Yoga, which is easier,
through which you achieve.

01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:46.230
Sankhya Yoga can be that you achieve your
Realization; you meditate in the jungles,

01:08:46.230 --> 01:08:52.020
go stay there, keep away from all the worldly
things, meditate, meditate, meditate and try

01:08:52.020 --> 01:08:53.340
to rise.

01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:57.000
But such people are absolutely useless, I
have seen.

01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.240
My own experience is that such people are
useless for all worldly things: they cannot

01:09:01.240 --> 01:09:03.989
be compassionate; they cannot come down from
their levels.

01:09:03.989 --> 01:09:04.989
When they come down, they again get contaminated.

01:09:04.989 --> 01:09:12.030
So, the second thing is very easy: that you
get your Realization and start on the Karma

01:09:12.030 --> 01:09:14.630
Yoga, cleansing yourself.

01:09:14.630 --> 01:09:21.580
Once you have done your cleansing, you achieve
it because it is immune, immune to everything.

01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:27.339
W.: By the supreme state which is reached
by the sankhya yogi, is attained also by the

01:09:27.339 --> 01:09:33.880
karma yogi, therefore he who sees sankhya
yoga and karma yoga as one, so far as their

01:09:33.880 --> 01:09:36.400
result goes, really sees.

01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:41.420
Without karma yoga, however, sankhya yoga
or renunciation of doership in relation to

01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:46.880
all activities of the mind, senses and body,
is difficult to attain.

01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:51.380
Whereas the karma yogi, who keeps his mind
fixed on God, reaches Brahma…

01:09:51.380 --> 01:09:57.370
Shri Mataji: Means, you don’t become a Sanyasi;
now, it’s for Bala! You don’t become a

01:09:57.370 --> 01:10:03.340
Sanyasi, you work here: is easier, definite,
sure-shot.

01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:08.250
W.: … he reaches the Brahma in no time,
Arjuna.

01:10:08.250 --> 01:10:13.170
The karma yogi who has fully conquered his
mind and subdued his senses, whose heart is

01:10:13.170 --> 01:10:19.600
pure and who has identified his self with
the self of all beings, remains unaffected

01:10:19.600 --> 01:10:22.480
even though he is performing action.

01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:28.770
The sankhya yogi, however, who knows the reality
of things, even though seeing, hearing, touching,

01:10:28.770 --> 01:10:34.250
smelling, eating, going, sleeping, breathing,
speaking, passing urine and stools, taking

01:10:34.250 --> 01:10:41.660
and opening or closing the eyes, must believe
that he does nothing, holding that it is the

01:10:41.660 --> 01:10:44.510
senses that are acting on the sense objects.

01:10:44.510 --> 01:10:51.480
He who acts offering all actions to God and
shaking off attachment, remains untouched

01:10:51.480 --> 01:10:55.440
by sin as the lotus leaf by water.

01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:01.440
The karma yogis perform action only with their
senses, mind, intellect and body as well,

01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:07.340
withdrawing the feeling of meum in respect
to them and shaking off attachment simply

01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:11.300
for the sake of self-purification.

01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:15.570
Offering the fruits of action to God the karma
yogi attains peace in the shape of God-realization…

01:11:15.570 --> 01:11:18.770
Shri Mataji: “This is only possible after
Realization; how can you offer action?

01:11:18.770 --> 01:11:22.219
Fruit of action – you cannot."

01:11:22.219 --> 01:11:26.670
W.: Only then he attains peace in the shape
of God-realization.

01:11:26.670 --> 01:11:31.770
Whereas he who works for the selfish motive,
being attached to the fruit of action through

01:11:31.770 --> 01:11:33.860
desire, gets tied down.

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:39.090
The self-controlled sankhya yogi, doing nothing
himself and getting nothing done by others,

01:11:39.090 --> 01:11:45.469
rests happily in God, mentally relegating
all actions to the city of nine gates, the

01:11:45.469 --> 01:11:48.000
body with nine holes.

01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:53.440
The Lord determines not the doership nor the
doing of beings nor even their contact with

01:11:53.440 --> 01:11:54.620
the fruits of actions.

01:11:54.620 --> 01:12:00.500
It is nature that functions deriving its motive
power from God.

01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:05.590
The Omnipresent Lord does not partake of the
virtue or sin of anyone.

01:12:05.590 --> 01:12:14.340
Knowledge is enveloped in ignorance, hence
it is that beings are constantly falling into

01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:16.280
a prey to delusion.

01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:23.690
Shri Mataji: See, ‘Prey to a delusion’
– and delusion, if identified with yourself,

01:12:23.690 --> 01:12:25.750
then God save you.

01:12:25.750 --> 01:12:28.440
Again, it comes to Me, but what to do?

01:12:28.440 --> 01:12:31.670
‘God save you’ means also I have to do
it!” (Laughs)

01:12:31.670 --> 01:12:38.690
W.: In the case however of those whose said
ignorance has been destroyed by the knowledge

01:12:38.690 --> 01:12:44.500
of God, that wisdom shining like the sun reveals
the Supreme.

01:12:44.500 --> 01:12:49.770
Those whose mind and intellect are wholly
merged in Him, who are constantly established

01:12:49.770 --> 01:12:55.170
in identity with Him, and are exclusively
devoted to Him, their sins being wiped out

01:12:55.170 --> 01:13:00.080
by wisdom, go to whence there is no return.

01:13:00.080 --> 01:13:05.540
The wise look with the same eye on a Brahman
endowed with learning and culture, a cow,

01:13:05.540 --> 01:13:09.250
an elephant, a dog and a pariah.

01:13:09.250 --> 01:13:15.420
Even here is the mortal plane conquered by
those whose mind is established in equanimity,

01:13:15.420 --> 01:13:22.090
since the Absolute is free from blemish and
equanimous, hence they are established in

01:13:22.090 --> 01:13:24.020
the eternal.

01:13:24.020 --> 01:13:30.010
He who with reason firm and free from doubt
rejoices not on obtaining what is agreeable,

01:13:30.010 --> 01:13:34.860
and does not feel perturbed on meeting with
the unpleasant, that knower of Brahma lives

01:13:34.860 --> 01:13:38.450
eternally in identity with It.

01:13:38.450 --> 01:13:44.270
He whose mind remains unattached to external
enjoyment, derives through meditation the

01:13:44.270 --> 01:13:47.410
unmixed joy which is inherent in the soul.

01:13:47.410 --> 01:13:54.110
Then that yogi, having completely identified
himself through meditation with Brahma, enjoys

01:13:54.110 --> 01:13:57.130
eternal bliss.

01:13:57.130 --> 01:14:03.520
The pleasures which are born of sense contacts
are verily sources of pain, though appearing

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:06.800
as enjoyable to worldly-minded people.

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:11.410
They have a beginning and an end, they come
and they go.

01:14:11.410 --> 01:14:16.239
Arjuna, it is for this reason that wise man
does not indulge in them.

01:14:16.239 --> 01:14:22.650
He who is able to stand here on earth, before
casting off his body, the urges of lust and

01:14:22.650 --> 01:14:28.400
anger, he is the yogi: a harmonized soul,
he is the happy man.

01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:34.060
He who is happy within himself, enjoys within
himself the delight of the soul, and even

01:14:34.060 --> 01:14:40.870
so is illumined by the inner light, or the
light of the soul, such a yogi, or a sankhya

01:14:40.870 --> 01:14:45.700
yogi, identified with Brahma attains the Brahma
who is all peace.

01:14:45.700 --> 01:14:52.570
The seers whose sins have been washed away,
whose doubts have been dispelled by knowledge,

01:14:52.570 --> 01:14:57.520
whose mind is firmly established in God and
who are actively engaged in promoting the

01:14:57.520 --> 01:15:03.730
welfare of all beings, attain Brahma who is
all peace.

01:15:03.730 --> 01:15:09.030
To those wise men who are free from lust and
anger, who have subdued their mind and have

01:15:09.030 --> 01:15:17.130
realized God, Brahma, the abode of the eternal
peace, is present all around.

01:15:17.130 --> 01:15:22.190
Shutting off the thoughts of external sense
enjoyments, with the eyes fixed on the space

01:15:22.190 --> 01:15:28.460
between the eyebrows, having equalized the
prana and apana breaths – outwardly and

01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:33.440
inwardly – flowing within the nostrils,
he who has brought his senses, mind and reason

01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:39.970
under control, such a contemplative soul,
intent on liberation, and free from desire,

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:44.150
fear and anger, is ever liberated.

01:15:44.150 --> 01:15:49.010
Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer
of sacrifices and the austerities…

01:15:49.010 --> 01:15:53.440
Shri Mataji: Now, this part of Hatha Yoga
we have not yet started in Sahaja Yoga, but

01:15:53.440 --> 01:15:54.780
I will start it gradually.

01:15:54.780 --> 01:15:59.620
Because the tendency, in the West specially,
is to go to extremes, so I don’t want to

01:15:59.620 --> 01:16:02.590
do it, you see.

01:16:02.590 --> 01:16:09.219
W.: Having known Me in reality as the enjoyer
of sacrifices and austerities, the supreme

01:16:09.219 --> 01:16:17.960
Lord of all the worlds and the disinterested
friend of all beings, My devotee attains peace.

01:16:17.960 --> 01:16:31.380
Shri Mataji: I hope you have followed it now,
you see?

01:16:31.380 --> 01:16:41.460
So, Sankhya and these things you should clearly
understand, and is a very good way of understanding

01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:45.280
what is expected of you – to have the bliss.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:51.960
And what is to be done is first of all to
get your Realization and then become Karma

01:16:51.960 --> 01:16:53.900
Yogi.

01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.060
Work it out on Karma Yoga: means you do not
become a Sanyasi, don’t run away from this

01:16:58.060 --> 01:16:59.640
world, settle down somewhere else.

01:16:59.640 --> 01:17:06.070
Because it will be very difficult: you go
out of this world, stay somewhere, and when

01:17:06.070 --> 01:17:08.300
you come back again you become a bhoot.

01:17:08.300 --> 01:17:09.489
So what’s the use?

01:17:09.489 --> 01:17:13.710
Instead of that, work it out here and perfect
it.

01:17:13.710 --> 01:17:16.890
So, this is Karma Yoga.

01:17:16.890 --> 01:17:24.240
That’s why we don’t like Sanyasis here,
because Sanyasis are a different style; they

01:17:24.240 --> 01:17:26.190
are ascetics, so called.

01:17:26.190 --> 01:17:29.560
They are really not ascetics, but possessed
ascetics.

01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:34.739
So we have to first bring them in the center
and to understand they are in center where

01:17:34.739 --> 01:17:40.010
they have given up the duality – extreme
of this and that.

01:17:40.010 --> 01:17:47.550
They have to check it all the time and, when
I am here, you should check it.

01:17:47.550 --> 01:17:52.760
For example, now some people are performing
Puja in Scotland; they said so.

01:17:52.760 --> 01:17:55.260
I mean, whose Puja are you perform[ing] – My
photograph?

01:17:55.260 --> 01:17:57.075
[ie they’re doing Puja to the photograph,
not to Mother].

01:17:57.075 --> 01:17:59.000
Can’t you perform your Puja here for Scotland?

01:17:59.000 --> 01:18:03.390
But I delude.

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:07.030
They were not to be here for such an important
Puja: I delude, I do it.

01:18:07.030 --> 01:18:08.980
I have told you I am Mahamaya.

01:18:08.980 --> 01:18:12.680
That’s how they were deluded with the idea
that they will perform My Puja in Scotland

01:18:12.680 --> 01:18:13.680
for Scotland.

01:18:13.680 --> 01:18:15.180
What is the need to go to Scotland?

01:18:15.180 --> 01:18:16.180
Can’t you perform it here?

01:18:16.180 --> 01:18:18.200
I mean, I am here, why shouldn’t you be
here?

01:18:18.200 --> 01:18:32.970
But when they asked Me I said, “All right,
if you want to do it, you can do it."

01:18:32.970 --> 01:18:40.950
Sometimes, for some people, My photograph
is more important than Me.

01:18:40.950 --> 01:18:42.780
Imagine the delusions!

01:18:42.780 --> 01:18:46.660
Yes, so many are like that.

01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:52.880
And then they’ll say, “Mother, we did
the Puja and then this thing happened."

01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:57.820
The delusions must show themselves.

01:18:57.820 --> 01:19:17.800
Now who else is coming after that?

01:19:48.180 --> 01:20:00.750
Now, somebody can read Devi’s names?

01:20:00.750 --> 01:20:05.050
Eleven names, or, say, hundred and eight names?

01:20:05.050 --> 01:20:06.660
Who can read?

01:20:06.660 --> 01:20:08.860
Now read, anyone from your group.

01:20:08.860 --> 01:20:12.860
You can do it.

01:20:12.860 --> 01:20:14.340
Hundred and eight names, yes.

01:20:14.340 --> 01:20:16.100
You do it while they are washing.

01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.100
Who are washing?

01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.969
Have you done it?

01:20:18.969 --> 01:20:20.270
Come along.

01:20:20.270 --> 01:20:33.790
Rub it, rub it hard, rub it hard, is to pour
water.

01:20:33.790 --> 01:20:36.040
Very good.

01:20:36.040 --> 01:21:17.410
Rub it hard, pour more water, take more water
from there.

01:21:17.410 --> 01:21:40.890
(To somebody:) The sari’s looking nice,
Phyllis.

01:21:40.890 --> 01:21:42.770
But you must learn how to wear it, alright?

01:21:42.770 --> 01:21:43.770
Ask Chaya how to do it.

01:21:43.770 --> 01:21:44.770
That’s all, good.

01:21:44.770 --> 01:21:45.770
May God bless you.

01:21:45.770 --> 01:21:46.770
Where is he gone?

01:21:46.770 --> 01:21:47.770
Good.

01:21:47.770 --> 01:21:48.770
Now, who else?

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:49.770
Rub it hard, hard.

01:21:49.770 --> 01:21:50.770
Rub it hard, very hard.

01:21:50.770 --> 01:21:57.500
My feet are very strong.

01:21:57.500 --> 01:23:24.080
Yesterday there were two people, (…) ladies:
they got exhausted while … (She laughs)

01:23:24.080 --> 01:23:38.790
Rub it hard! Just see which ones are the twenty-one
names of the Goddess?

01:23:38.790 --> 01:23:44.630
(Yogi: Hundred and eight names?”)
But it is better to have it in English.

01:23:44.630 --> 01:23:57.420
Somebody can do it in Sanskrit and somebody
can… but very difficult.

01:23:57.420 --> 01:24:03.460
You’ve got two books, is it?

01:24:03.460 --> 01:24:16.170
(Yogi: That’s Devi Mahatmya, this is Lalita
Sahasranama…)

01:24:16.170 --> 01:25:06.830
Hundred and eight names we do it from here.
