00:03:58.912 --> 00:04:05.446
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

00:04:05.646 --> 00:04:12.786
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

00:04:14.876 --> 00:04:17.166
We can say this is the worship

00:04:17.366 --> 00:04:21.256
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

00:04:21.456 --> 00:04:31.186
If you understand that all this,

00:04:31.386 --> 00:04:38.216
whatever is created on this universe,

00:04:38.426 --> 00:04:45.666
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:04:46.106 --> 00:04:49.796
Now many people believe that there is one God.

00:04:49.996 --> 00:04:55.006
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

00:04:55.206 --> 00:05:03.556
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

00:05:03.756 --> 00:05:10.866
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

00:05:11.226 --> 00:05:19.056
So, first of all, He did was to create

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:22.826
the power of Adi Shakti.

00:05:23.036 --> 00:05:29.366
When It was created then there was a sound,

00:05:29.566 --> 00:05:33.426
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

00:05:33.626 --> 00:05:35.846
by the primordial sound,

00:05:36.046 --> 00:05:40.106
and these three powers came out of that sound -

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:45.826
is A, U and M -Aum.

00:05:46.216 --> 00:05:50.646
The Adi Shakti is the One

00:05:50.846 --> 00:05:58.126
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

00:05:58.976 --> 00:06:05.826
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

00:06:06.026 --> 00:06:12.586
and for His own expression,

00:06:12.786 --> 00:06:16.106
for His own manifestation,

00:06:16.306 --> 00:06:20.426
for His own reflection.

00:06:21.546 --> 00:06:26.326
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

00:06:26.526 --> 00:06:31.426
so He must have thought of creating a partner

00:06:31.626 --> 00:06:37.096
who will manifest His desires.

00:06:37.606 --> 00:06:47.106
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

00:06:47.306 --> 00:06:53.616
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

00:06:53.816 --> 00:06:59.096
His desire to create.

00:06:59.776 --> 00:07:03.836
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

00:07:04.036 --> 00:07:08.476
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

00:07:08.676 --> 00:07:12.506
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

00:07:12.706 --> 00:07:18.696
The attention has its own joy

00:07:18.896 --> 00:07:23.506
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

00:07:23.706 --> 00:07:26.866
She created all the universes,

00:07:27.066 --> 00:07:31.776
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:37.466
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

00:07:37.676 --> 00:07:41.226
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

00:07:41.426 --> 00:07:47.816
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

00:07:49.226 --> 00:07:51.946
At this juncture one may ask that,

00:07:52.156 --> 00:07:57.316
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

00:07:57.866 --> 00:08:00.726
That was the idea of God Almighty,

00:08:00.926 --> 00:08:07.636
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

00:08:07.836 --> 00:08:14.116
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

00:08:14.386 --> 00:08:17.126
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

00:08:17.326 --> 00:08:21.286
She had Her own way of expression,

00:08:21.486 --> 00:08:25.216
that She thought She must create the mirrors

00:08:25.416 --> 00:08:30.856
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

00:08:31.056 --> 00:08:32.706
to see His character

00:08:32.916 --> 00:08:38.676
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

00:08:40.946 --> 00:08:45.276
This evolution had to work out this way

00:08:45.476 --> 00:08:51.106
because they had to know from where they come.

00:08:51.346 --> 00:08:57.536
We must know that we come from nature.

00:08:57.736 --> 00:09:03.436
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

00:09:03.646 --> 00:09:08.496
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

00:09:08.696 --> 00:09:14.556
And She too is not just a dead earth,

00:09:14.756 --> 00:09:19.296
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

00:09:19.506 --> 00:09:25.116
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

00:09:25.316 --> 00:09:32.306
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

00:09:32.506 --> 00:09:38.246
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

00:09:38.446 --> 00:09:43.086
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

00:09:43.286 --> 00:09:47.486
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

00:09:47.686 --> 00:09:51.626
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

00:09:51.826 --> 00:09:54.206
See the whole plan that was made.

00:09:54.406 --> 00:09:59.836
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

00:10:00.046 --> 00:10:04.796
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

00:10:04.996 --> 00:10:07.986
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

00:10:08.186 --> 00:10:10.506
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

00:10:10.706 --> 00:10:14.226
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

00:10:14.426 --> 00:10:20.316
This is the power that does all the living work,

00:10:20.516 --> 00:10:26.536
all the organization, all the creation.

00:10:31.096 --> 00:10:36.366
In our human ego we start thinking that

00:10:36.566 --> 00:10:40.416
we do something, we can create.

00:10:40.616 --> 00:10:46.916
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

00:10:47.116 --> 00:10:49.496
leave alone anything else.

00:10:49.696 --> 00:10:54.766
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

00:10:54.966 --> 00:11:00.466
we can put together and create something,

00:11:00.666 --> 00:11:10.046
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

00:11:10.246 --> 00:11:15.126
any power.

00:11:15.326 --> 00:11:18.366
We cannot create anything.

00:11:18.566 --> 00:11:26.336
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

00:11:26.536 --> 00:11:31.946
For example, something is made of gold.

00:11:32.146 --> 00:11:35.276
Still it is gold.

00:11:35.476 --> 00:11:38.616
Now something is made of wood,

00:11:38.816 --> 00:11:43.216
whatever it is made, is wood.

00:11:43.416 --> 00:11:46.986
The principle is the same into everything.

00:11:47.186 --> 00:11:51.906
So whatever may be your birth,

00:11:52.106 --> 00:11:54.986
whatever may be the country you are born,

00:11:55.186 --> 00:12:01.726
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

00:12:01.926 --> 00:12:05.546
basically you all are the same.

00:12:05.746 --> 00:12:11.186
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

00:12:11.386 --> 00:12:15.596
also, you cry the same way.

00:12:16.069 --> 00:12:19.466
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

00:12:19.666 --> 00:12:24.326
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:30.456
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

00:12:30.656 --> 00:12:35.316
by some common principle of life.

00:12:35.516 --> 00:12:40.926
And the common principle of life that has bound us

00:12:41.136 --> 00:12:47.976
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

00:12:48.176 --> 00:12:50.886
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

00:12:51.086 --> 00:12:53.336
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

00:12:53.536 --> 00:12:57.676
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

00:12:57.876 --> 00:13:06.956
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

00:13:07.156 --> 00:13:10.436
But in the human form only

00:13:10.636 --> 00:13:17.576
it has evolved as a connection,

00:13:17.776 --> 00:13:23.166
as one that is the divine force within us,

00:13:23.366 --> 00:13:28.666
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

00:13:28.866 --> 00:13:34.816
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

00:13:35.016 --> 00:13:38.376
This is the common principle we all have.

00:13:38.576 --> 00:13:45.876
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

00:13:46.076 --> 00:13:51.056
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

00:13:51.266 --> 00:13:58.186
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

00:13:58.766 --> 00:14:01.336
Then there are people, as you people are,

00:14:01.536 --> 00:14:06.346
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

00:14:06.556 --> 00:14:09.516
who have got your realization.

00:14:09.716 --> 00:14:13.936
So when you understand that this is the

00:14:14.136 --> 00:14:21.076
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

00:14:21.276 --> 00:14:24.856
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

00:14:25.056 --> 00:14:26.746
and the enjoyment.

00:14:26.946 --> 00:14:36.686
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

00:14:36.896 --> 00:14:40.446
what should happen to you?

00:14:40.646 --> 00:14:45.096
What should we feel?

00:14:45.296 --> 00:14:51.386
How do we then exist?

00:14:52.106 --> 00:14:57.396
This is the question many a times you have asked.

00:14:57.756 --> 00:15:01.256
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

00:15:01.456 --> 00:15:02.886
that you are not there,

00:15:03.086 --> 00:15:07.016
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

00:15:07.216 --> 00:15:09.186
Secondly, what happens to you

00:15:09.386 --> 00:15:14.106
is that you become just the existence.

00:15:14.306 --> 00:15:17.066
Just the existence.

00:15:17.266 --> 00:15:19.816
And that existence that you become,

00:15:20.016 --> 00:15:25.376
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

00:15:25.896 --> 00:15:30.996
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

00:15:31.196 --> 00:15:33.036
also much before.

00:15:33.236 --> 00:15:35.746
In every religion we have had people

00:15:35.946 --> 00:15:40.416
who had this divine character very well developed.

00:15:40.616 --> 00:15:45.766
For example, even you can say,

00:15:45.966 --> 00:15:52.936
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

00:15:53.136 --> 00:16:00.006
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

00:16:00.206 --> 00:16:02.676
and a khumba also,

00:16:02.876 --> 00:16:05.756
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

00:16:05.956 --> 00:16:12.556
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

00:16:12.756 --> 00:16:17.366
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

00:16:17.566 --> 00:16:22.506
You know that there is this power within us.

00:16:22.716 --> 00:16:28.076
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

00:16:28.286 --> 00:16:33.716
from the middle path of our ascent.

00:16:33.916 --> 00:16:36.546
Here also the same Kundalini,

00:16:36.746 --> 00:16:41.952
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

00:16:42.366 --> 00:16:48.826
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

00:16:49.026 --> 00:16:53.836
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

00:16:54.036 --> 00:16:58.326
So now when we are enlightened people,

00:16:58.536 --> 00:17:03.706
we have become saints and we are above all others,

00:17:03.906 --> 00:17:10.976
what should we do is to understand fully well -

00:17:11.176 --> 00:17:14.286
not only mentally, but from your heart -

00:17:14.486 --> 00:17:20.596
that now you have got these divine vibrations

00:17:20.796 --> 00:17:25.886
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

00:17:26.086 --> 00:17:31.326
what are you, where is the problem.

00:17:31.526 --> 00:17:34.446
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

00:17:34.646 --> 00:17:39.176
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

00:17:39.376 --> 00:17:42.746
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

00:17:42.946 --> 00:17:46.326
with spiritual vibrations."

00:17:46.526 --> 00:17:48.936
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

00:17:49.136 --> 00:17:51.096
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

00:17:51.296 --> 00:17:55.486
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

00:17:55.686 --> 00:17:59.726
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

00:17:59.926 --> 00:18:01.836
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

00:18:02.036 --> 00:18:03.926
from here only there are vibrations,

00:18:04.126 --> 00:18:06.496
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

00:18:06.696 --> 00:18:09.066
So then he sat down and started wondering,

00:18:09.266 --> 00:18:14.316
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

00:18:14.516 --> 00:18:20.226
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

00:18:20.426 --> 00:18:24.256
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

00:18:24.466 --> 00:18:28.366
and that's how he found the place.

00:18:28.766 --> 00:18:31.036
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

00:18:31.236 --> 00:18:34.146
is not done haphazard, in any way.

00:18:34.346 --> 00:18:37.516
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

00:18:37.716 --> 00:18:43.846
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

00:18:44.426 --> 00:18:49.866
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

00:18:50.286 --> 00:18:52.616
We are the ones which spoil the nature

00:18:52.816 --> 00:18:57.116
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

00:18:57.316 --> 00:18:59.416
and we have to respect it.

00:18:59.616 --> 00:19:01.706
I've already told you many a times

00:19:01.906 --> 00:19:04.796
about how human beings were formed

00:19:04.996 --> 00:19:11.946
by different chemicals who came also,

00:19:12.146 --> 00:19:15.206
carbon came from the mother earth.

00:19:15.406 --> 00:19:18.646
All this leads us to understand

00:19:18.846 --> 00:19:23.496
that we have a very big responsibility.

00:19:24.056 --> 00:19:30.046
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

00:19:30.246 --> 00:19:32.956
And now you all have reached a state

00:19:33.156 --> 00:19:37.096
where you have become yourself.

00:19:37.296 --> 00:19:39.446
You know yourself.

00:19:39.646 --> 00:19:43.696
This is a very big, I think should say,

00:19:43.896 --> 00:19:51.206
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

00:19:53.576 --> 00:20:00.326
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

00:20:29.796 --> 00:20:35.206
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

00:20:35.406 --> 00:20:42.526
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

00:20:42.726 --> 00:20:52.406
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

00:20:53.846 --> 00:20:58.896
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

00:20:59.096 --> 00:21:02.826
and these centers have to be awakened

00:21:03.026 --> 00:21:06.526
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

00:21:06.726 --> 00:21:14.506
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

00:21:15.366 --> 00:21:24.296
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

00:21:24.496 --> 00:21:29.226
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

00:21:29.426 --> 00:21:35.356
from the path of your perfection.

00:21:36.456 --> 00:21:39.896
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

00:21:40.096 --> 00:21:44.606
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

00:21:44.816 --> 00:21:48.726
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

00:21:48.926 --> 00:21:53.546
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

00:21:53.746 --> 00:21:58.506
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

00:21:58.816 --> 00:22:02.596
There are so many ways of people relating

00:22:02.796 --> 00:22:06.456
to the power of the Divine.

00:22:06.666 --> 00:22:10.946
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

00:22:11.146 --> 00:22:16.616
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

00:22:16.816 --> 00:22:19.996
and through Her the whole universe was created.

00:22:20.196 --> 00:22:27.936
But also true that as you are seeking,

00:22:28.146 --> 00:22:31.386
also the Divine is seeking you.

00:22:31.586 --> 00:22:39.936
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

00:22:40.136 --> 00:22:47.696
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

00:22:47.896 --> 00:22:53.656
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

00:22:53.856 --> 00:22:57.826
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

00:22:58.026 --> 00:23:00.996
It is the One which has given you

00:23:01.196 --> 00:23:04.176
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

00:23:04.376 --> 00:23:08.726
"Whatever we have is given by You".

00:23:09.046 --> 00:23:13.436
If that is the case that all that you have

00:23:13.636 --> 00:23:18.086
is given by your Kundalini,

00:23:18.296 --> 00:23:21.986
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

00:23:22.186 --> 00:23:26.946
then is very important to understand what is the need

00:23:27.196 --> 00:23:34.816
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

00:23:36.266 --> 00:23:43.786
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

00:23:45.216 --> 00:23:48.396
As I said, there's a relationship

00:23:48.596 --> 00:23:55.126
between the realized souls and the Divine.

00:23:55.326 --> 00:23:59.186
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

00:23:59.396 --> 00:24:05.056
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

00:24:05.256 --> 00:24:08.696
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

00:24:08.896 --> 00:24:11.746
It's such a relationship.

00:24:11.946 --> 00:24:15.076
And it's so close, it's so close,

00:24:15.276 --> 00:24:20.536
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

00:24:20.736 --> 00:24:27.636
or the moon has its own moonlight.

00:24:27.836 --> 00:24:39.066
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

00:24:39.266 --> 00:24:44.486
and that should give you full control over yourself

00:24:44.686 --> 00:24:50.026
and over your development.

00:24:50.526 --> 00:24:58.076
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

00:24:58.936 --> 00:25:02.696
Now

00:25:08.291 --> 00:25:13.426
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

00:25:13.646 --> 00:25:16.356
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

00:25:16.556 --> 00:25:17.956
you may.

00:25:18.166 --> 00:25:20.096
But as soon as that person will disappear,

00:25:20.296 --> 00:25:23.396
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

00:25:23.596 --> 00:25:26.866
That surrender has no meaning.

00:25:27.066 --> 00:25:33.296
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

00:25:33.496 --> 00:25:37.426
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

00:25:37.636 --> 00:25:41.216
because it has a reaction.

00:25:41.416 --> 00:25:49.436
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

00:25:49.666 --> 00:26:05.536
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

00:26:05.736 --> 00:26:11.436
into the water automatically,

00:26:11.636 --> 00:26:19.376
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

00:26:19.976 --> 00:26:24.416
If you can just feel that within yourself,

00:26:24.616 --> 00:26:27.806
that you are one with the Divine.

00:26:28.006 --> 00:26:33.096
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

00:26:33.596 --> 00:26:43.466
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

00:26:43.676 --> 00:26:50.066
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

00:26:50.266 --> 00:26:57.246
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

00:26:57.876 --> 00:27:03.226
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

00:27:03.426 --> 00:27:07.266
There's a great joy in forgiving,

00:27:07.466 --> 00:27:11.986
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

00:27:12.186 --> 00:27:18.486
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

00:27:19.056 --> 00:27:22.596
Nobody can disturb you.

00:27:22.796 --> 00:27:27.246
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

00:27:27.446 --> 00:27:29.686
that is what is forgiveness.

00:27:29.886 --> 00:27:34.406
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

00:27:34.606 --> 00:27:37.346
or to do something against somebody.

00:27:37.546 --> 00:27:41.536
The Divine takes over from you

00:27:41.736 --> 00:27:44.636
and does whatever is needed,

00:27:44.836 --> 00:27:51.506
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

00:27:51.906 --> 00:27:57.066
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

00:27:57.266 --> 00:27:59.506
say in Islam called ruh;

00:27:59.706 --> 00:28:04.486
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

00:28:04.686 --> 00:28:08.866
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

00:28:09.066 --> 00:28:14.826
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

00:28:15.026 --> 00:28:19.626
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

00:28:19.826 --> 00:28:23.386
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

00:28:23.586 --> 00:28:29.146
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

00:28:29.346 --> 00:28:34.306
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

00:28:34.516 --> 00:28:36.846
how to make others feel it.

00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:40.536
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

00:28:40.736 --> 00:28:42.786
or something nonsensical.

00:28:42.986 --> 00:28:46.766
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

00:28:46.966 --> 00:28:52.886
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

00:28:53.086 --> 00:28:58.926
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

00:28:59.126 --> 00:29:03.206
that you know there is this Power.

00:29:03.406 --> 00:29:05.756
You're sure about this Power

00:29:05.956 --> 00:29:10.136
because you can feel it within yourself.

00:29:10.336 --> 00:29:13.276
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

00:29:13.486 --> 00:29:19.656
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

00:29:19.856 --> 00:29:25.466
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

00:29:25.666 --> 00:29:34.996
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

00:29:35.206 --> 00:29:38.436
She tells you the truth.

00:29:40.486 --> 00:29:45.476
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

00:29:45.676 --> 00:29:50.316
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

00:29:50.516 --> 00:29:54.276
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

00:29:54.486 --> 00:29:59.706
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

00:29:59.906 --> 00:30:02.256
This kind of argument is possible.

00:30:02.456 --> 00:30:05.176
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

00:30:05.376 --> 00:30:08.046
that you forgive that person,

00:30:08.246 --> 00:30:12.836
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

00:30:13.036 --> 00:30:15.856
you don't do anything.

00:30:16.056 --> 00:30:17.536
That's the truth.

00:30:17.746 --> 00:30:22.286
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

00:30:22.486 --> 00:30:25.946
compassion becomes the truth.

00:30:26.146 --> 00:30:29.826
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

00:30:30.026 --> 00:30:33.166
So all the absolute truth that you know is

00:30:33.366 --> 00:30:38.006
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

00:30:38.206 --> 00:30:42.916
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

00:30:43.116 --> 00:30:46.286
and we felt this way and still it happened."

00:30:46.496 --> 00:30:49.426
It makes no difference.

00:30:49.626 --> 00:30:52.486
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

00:30:52.686 --> 00:30:56.726
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

00:30:56.926 --> 00:31:01.156
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

00:31:01.356 --> 00:31:05.976
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

00:31:06.176 --> 00:31:09.576
Because it had to be the other way round.

00:31:09.776 --> 00:31:13.186
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

00:31:13.396 --> 00:31:18.216
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

00:31:18.416 --> 00:31:21.116
So, it's a play going on.

00:31:21.316 --> 00:31:27.576
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

00:31:27.786 --> 00:31:36.526
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

00:31:36.726 --> 00:31:42.036
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

00:31:42.236 --> 00:31:46.706
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

00:31:46.906 --> 00:31:50.816
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

00:31:51.016 --> 00:31:58.546
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

00:31:58.826 --> 00:32:07.386
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

00:32:07.866 --> 00:32:10.516
When you have the enlightened faith,

00:32:10.716 --> 00:32:17.246
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

00:32:17.446 --> 00:32:23.286
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

00:32:23.776 --> 00:32:28.606
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

00:32:28.806 --> 00:32:34.486
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

00:32:34.876 --> 00:32:38.266
Not necessarily. It's a play.

00:32:38.466 --> 00:32:46.356
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

00:32:46.556 --> 00:32:49.896
So if you can become the witness,

00:32:50.096 --> 00:32:53.666
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

00:32:53.866 --> 00:33:01.276
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:07.466
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

00:33:07.666 --> 00:33:10.526
That dissolution has to take place.

00:33:10.726 --> 00:33:14.446
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

00:33:14.646 --> 00:33:20.186
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

00:33:20.386 --> 00:33:24.486
this work could not have been done.

00:33:24.696 --> 00:33:29.746
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

00:33:29.946 --> 00:33:41.846
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

00:33:42.056 --> 00:33:45.916
all the aspects of this human life.

00:33:46.116 --> 00:33:49.686
It had to be such an Incarnation

00:33:49.886 --> 00:33:57.876
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

00:33:58.076 --> 00:34:02.396
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

00:34:02.596 --> 00:34:10.226
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

00:34:10.426 --> 00:34:13.456
as a whole, as a human being.

00:34:13.656 --> 00:34:17.986
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

00:34:18.186 --> 00:34:21.506
all of them are just the same.

00:34:21.716 --> 00:34:30.876
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

00:34:31.076 --> 00:34:34.956
some are not seeking genuinely,

00:34:35.156 --> 00:34:38.606
and some are not seeking at all.

00:34:38.806 --> 00:34:43.696
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

00:34:43.906 --> 00:34:49.746
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

00:34:49.946 --> 00:34:54.516
one fish came out of the mother.

00:34:54.716 --> 00:35:01.686
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

00:35:01.886 --> 00:35:07.206
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

00:35:07.406 --> 00:35:12.436
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

00:35:12.836 --> 00:35:19.546
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

00:35:20.046 --> 00:35:24.416
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

00:35:24.616 --> 00:35:28.426
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

00:35:28.626 --> 00:35:31.236
James or what St. John has said,

00:35:31.436 --> 00:35:34.286
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

00:35:34.476 --> 00:35:36.036
It doesn't matter.

00:35:36.236 --> 00:35:43.906
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

00:35:44.116 --> 00:35:48.086
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

00:35:48.286 --> 00:35:53.096
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

00:35:53.296 --> 00:35:58.516
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

00:35:58.716 --> 00:36:02.716
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

00:36:02.916 --> 00:36:05.696
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

00:36:05.896 --> 00:36:09.956
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

00:36:10.156 --> 00:36:14.116
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

00:36:14.316 --> 00:36:16.296
should not disturb you much

00:36:16.496 --> 00:36:21.046
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

00:36:21.246 --> 00:36:25.096
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

00:36:25.296 --> 00:36:29.636
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

00:36:29.836 --> 00:36:35.686
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

00:36:35.886 --> 00:36:39.876
all the useless things that we have,

00:36:40.076 --> 00:36:43.446
like our conditioning and our ego.

00:36:43.656 --> 00:36:46.676
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

00:36:46.876 --> 00:36:50.596
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

00:36:50.796 --> 00:36:54.666
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

00:36:54.866 --> 00:36:59.106
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

00:36:59.306 --> 00:37:01.046
That's human nature also.

00:37:01.246 --> 00:37:04.886
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

00:37:05.086 --> 00:37:08.616
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

00:37:08.816 --> 00:37:12.396
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

00:37:12.596 --> 00:37:17.056
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

00:37:17.256 --> 00:37:19.196
It will all work out.

00:37:19.396 --> 00:37:23.616
It will all work out, but your attention should be

00:37:23.816 --> 00:37:30.986
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

00:37:31.186 --> 00:37:33.806
of this compassion?".

00:37:34.006 --> 00:37:39.336
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

00:37:39.536 --> 00:37:43.066
which is going to give you strength.

00:37:43.266 --> 00:37:46.296
This compassion within you,

00:37:46.496 --> 00:37:50.076
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

00:37:50.276 --> 00:37:53.556
completely destroyed,

00:37:53.756 --> 00:37:57.556
your compassion itself will make you powerful

00:37:57.756 --> 00:38:02.016
and you'll do everything that is needed.

00:38:02.216 --> 00:38:06.546
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

00:38:06.746 --> 00:38:14.916
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

00:38:15.186 --> 00:38:17.826
And amazingly as you will do this,

00:38:18.026 --> 00:38:22.816
your own level of spirituality will rise.

00:38:24.696 --> 00:38:27.646
As you see, I would say,

00:38:27.846 --> 00:38:33.146
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

00:38:33.346 --> 00:38:35.696
the water rises.

00:38:35.896 --> 00:38:41.966
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

00:38:42.166 --> 00:38:45.946
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

00:38:46.146 --> 00:38:50.556
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

00:38:50.756 --> 00:38:53.106
there will be much more manifestation

00:38:53.306 --> 00:38:59.546
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

00:38:59.906 --> 00:39:06.426
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

00:39:06.626 --> 00:39:09.136
you all have got your Realization

00:39:09.336 --> 00:39:13.736
and that you are all now saintly people,

00:39:13.936 --> 00:39:17.336
then we should see to people who were like you.

00:39:17.536 --> 00:39:21.526
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:25.566
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

00:39:25.766 --> 00:39:31.156
What did they do? They went all out

00:39:31.356 --> 00:39:35.526
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

00:39:35.726 --> 00:39:37.806
They could not give realization as such,

00:39:38.006 --> 00:39:40.516
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

00:39:40.716 --> 00:39:45.116
they talked about it, they sang about it.

00:39:45.316 --> 00:39:48.496
That's what we have to understand

00:39:48.726 --> 00:39:57.846
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

00:39:58.046 --> 00:40:00.336
When you know the people are getting drowned,

00:40:00.536 --> 00:40:05.806
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

00:40:06.006 --> 00:40:11.766
I should say,

00:40:11.966 --> 00:40:17.626
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

00:40:17.836 --> 00:40:20.876
And if you have that compassion within you,

00:40:21.086 --> 00:40:26.126
you will go all out to save them.

00:40:26.326 --> 00:40:32.286
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

00:40:32.486 --> 00:40:37.356
of this enjoyment of your attention.

00:40:37.556 --> 00:40:40.866
Your attention itself will enjoy

00:40:41.066 --> 00:40:50.206
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

00:40:50.406 --> 00:40:53.436
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

00:40:53.636 --> 00:40:56.956
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

00:40:57.156 --> 00:41:02.806
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

00:41:03.006 --> 00:41:09.316
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

00:41:09.516 --> 00:41:11.996
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

00:41:12.196 --> 00:41:16.766
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

00:41:16.966 --> 00:41:23.256
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

00:41:23.456 --> 00:41:28.556
The more you use this power the better it will be.

00:41:28.756 --> 00:41:33.676
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

00:41:33.876 --> 00:41:37.866
For we haven't got many people from the black race

00:41:38.066 --> 00:41:39.996
I think, from Africa.

00:41:40.196 --> 00:41:44.526
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

00:41:44.726 --> 00:41:47.926
Also, we have so many other areas

00:41:48.126 --> 00:41:51.356
where I find we have to work it out,

00:41:51.556 --> 00:41:58.216
that if this compassion is within you

00:41:58.416 --> 00:42:00.756
then it will compel you, also,

00:42:00.956 --> 00:42:04.666
to do work that will bring solace to people

00:42:04.866 --> 00:42:07.586
who are not even seeking.

00:42:07.786 --> 00:42:12.926
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

00:42:13.126 --> 00:42:18.356
which will really create very beautiful institutions

00:42:18.556 --> 00:42:23.226
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

00:42:23.426 --> 00:42:27.466
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

00:42:27.666 --> 00:42:32.306
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

00:42:32.506 --> 00:42:37.756
you have dropped out your greed,

00:42:37.956 --> 00:42:43.966
you have dropped out your lust.

00:42:44.166 --> 00:42:49.136
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

00:42:49.346 --> 00:42:53.046
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

00:42:53.246 --> 00:42:56.686
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

00:42:56.886 --> 00:42:58.776
and then they start becoming leaders,

00:42:58.976 --> 00:43:04.676
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

00:43:04.876 --> 00:43:07.736
This you will not do.

00:43:07.936 --> 00:43:14.966
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

00:43:15.166 --> 00:43:21.396
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

00:43:21.596 --> 00:43:27.836
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

00:43:28.036 --> 00:43:32.106
Once we start spreading out like that,

00:43:32.306 --> 00:43:35.176
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

00:43:35.386 --> 00:43:38.406
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

00:43:38.606 --> 00:43:45.236
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

00:43:45.436 --> 00:43:49.066
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

00:43:49.266 --> 00:43:51.166
who don't have greed.

00:43:51.366 --> 00:43:54.306
I have known people who never had any greed,

00:43:54.506 --> 00:44:00.186
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:03.696
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

00:44:03.926 --> 00:44:07.496
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

00:44:07.696 --> 00:44:11.126
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

00:44:11.326 --> 00:44:13.756
But not Sahaja Yogis.

00:44:13.956 --> 00:44:16.186
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

00:44:16.386 --> 00:44:22.256
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

00:44:22.456 --> 00:44:25.606
Not their lust, not their greed

00:44:25.806 --> 00:44:29.526
and also the so-called deviations

00:44:29.726 --> 00:44:36.346
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

00:44:36.626 --> 00:44:39.276
Because they know what do they enjoy,

00:44:39.476 --> 00:44:41.866
where lies their enjoyment.

00:44:42.066 --> 00:44:44.466
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

00:44:44.666 --> 00:44:48.276
you will try to have more of it

00:44:48.476 --> 00:44:53.286
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

00:44:53.486 --> 00:44:56.396
I would say as the men are working it out,

00:44:56.596 --> 00:44:58.336
women should work it out

00:44:58.536 --> 00:45:03.896
because women have more sense of compassion,

00:45:04.096 --> 00:45:08.446
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

00:45:08.646 --> 00:45:11.646
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

00:45:11.846 --> 00:45:14.736
I'm saying about normal.

00:45:14.936 --> 00:45:20.196
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

00:45:20.396 --> 00:45:24.896
they have known what is love for the children is.

00:45:25.096 --> 00:45:26.856
Mother doesn't expect anything.

00:45:27.056 --> 00:45:30.736
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

00:45:30.936 --> 00:45:33.936
She enjoys her child, that's all.

00:45:34.136 --> 00:45:40.956
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

00:45:41.166 --> 00:45:43.116
See, I have seen young girls.

00:45:43.316 --> 00:45:46.716
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

00:45:46.926 --> 00:45:50.356
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

00:45:50.556 --> 00:45:55.176
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

00:45:55.386 --> 00:46:01.516
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

00:46:01.716 --> 00:46:05.856
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

00:46:06.066 --> 00:46:10.356
And as you are all married also,

00:46:10.556 --> 00:46:15.566
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

00:46:15.766 --> 00:46:22.496
by your own nature of Divinity.

00:46:22.696 --> 00:46:24.816
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

00:46:25.026 --> 00:46:28.906
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

00:46:29.106 --> 00:46:32.946
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

00:46:33.146 --> 00:46:36.596
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

00:46:36.796 --> 00:46:40.346
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

00:46:40.546 --> 00:46:43.576
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

00:46:43.776 --> 00:46:51.456
And if something

00:46:51.656 --> 00:46:53.956
has to be done, has to be done.

00:46:54.156 --> 00:46:56.336
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

00:46:56.536 --> 00:47:00.086
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

00:47:00.286 --> 00:47:03.466
and the household and this and that".

00:47:03.666 --> 00:47:07.266
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

00:47:07.266 --> 00:47:09.996
The whole day, what will you do?

00:47:10.196 --> 00:47:13.746
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

00:47:13.946 --> 00:47:17.796
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

00:47:17.996 --> 00:47:22.216
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

00:47:22.416 --> 00:47:27.366
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

00:47:27.566 --> 00:47:33.216
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

00:47:33.416 --> 00:47:41.586
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

00:47:41.786 --> 00:47:45.726
then you'll be never tired.

00:47:45.926 --> 00:47:48.766
You will never grudge.

00:47:48.966 --> 00:47:54.226
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

00:47:54.676 --> 00:47:58.466
This is a very important point that we should realize

00:47:58.666 --> 00:48:01.966
that if somebody is a woman or a man

00:48:02.166 --> 00:48:08.076
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

00:48:08.276 --> 00:48:13.116
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

00:48:13.316 --> 00:48:17.686
She has more power of compassion.

00:48:17.886 --> 00:48:21.206
In the same way the man has more power of action.

00:48:21.416 --> 00:48:24.406
So, the compassion has to become active.

00:48:24.606 --> 00:48:27.666
In this combination everything will work out

00:48:27.876 --> 00:48:30.146
in a very beautiful manner.

00:48:30.346 --> 00:48:35.126
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

00:48:35.326 --> 00:48:40.096
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

00:48:40.296 --> 00:48:43.356
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

00:48:43.556 --> 00:48:45.536
some of the women have been men

00:48:45.736 --> 00:48:50.386
and some of the men have been women.

00:48:50.586 --> 00:48:54.956
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

00:48:55.166 --> 00:49:00.886
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

00:49:01.086 --> 00:49:02.506
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:05.246
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

00:49:05.446 --> 00:49:08.146
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

00:49:08.356 --> 00:49:10.146
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

00:49:10.356 --> 00:49:13.156
Now here you should understand the relationship

00:49:13.366 --> 00:49:17.666
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

00:49:17.866 --> 00:49:23.836
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

00:49:24.046 --> 00:49:26.336
God Almighty is the Spectator;

00:49:26.536 --> 00:49:31.296
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

00:49:31.496 --> 00:49:33.906
She is compassion, of course.

00:49:34.106 --> 00:49:37.886
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

00:49:38.086 --> 00:49:41.506
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

00:49:41.706 --> 00:49:45.806
But He's the One who takes charge.

00:49:46.006 --> 00:49:51.046
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

00:49:51.246 --> 00:49:55.316
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

00:49:55.516 --> 00:50:00.416
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

00:50:00.626 --> 00:50:03.916
how it has worked out.

00:50:04.116 --> 00:50:08.166
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

00:50:08.366 --> 00:50:12.436
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

00:50:12.636 --> 00:50:17.126
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

00:50:17.326 --> 00:50:22.656
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

00:50:22.856 --> 00:50:24.626
I can't understand

00:50:24.826 --> 00:50:28.666
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

00:50:28.876 --> 00:50:35.546
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

00:50:35.746 --> 00:50:39.546
who knows what is the truth,

00:50:39.746 --> 00:50:48.646
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

00:50:48.846 --> 00:50:57.836
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

00:50:59.526 --> 00:51:03.246
It is to realize

00:51:03.446 --> 00:51:11.696
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

00:51:11.996 --> 00:51:15.936
You have entered into His kingdom

00:51:16.136 --> 00:51:22.476
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

00:51:22.676 --> 00:51:25.946
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

00:51:26.146 --> 00:51:28.826
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

00:51:29.026 --> 00:51:32.706
he still begs sitting on this throne.

00:51:32.906 --> 00:51:36.706
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

00:51:36.906 --> 00:51:39.576
I receive some funny letters sometimes

00:51:39.776 --> 00:51:44.316
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

00:51:44.516 --> 00:51:49.786
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

00:51:49.986 --> 00:51:55.886
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

00:51:56.096 --> 00:51:58.456
because it has a very bad impression,

00:51:58.656 --> 00:52:03.906
also, for other people and for your own life.

00:52:04.106 --> 00:52:07.746
For your own life, is very important

00:52:07.946 --> 00:52:12.126
that you should grow fully into the understanding

00:52:12.326 --> 00:52:18.256
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

00:52:18.456 --> 00:52:22.526
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

00:52:22.726 --> 00:52:26.856
What do you have to surrender?

00:52:28.426 --> 00:52:31.296
Just think of it.

00:52:31.496 --> 00:52:38.826
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

00:52:39.026 --> 00:52:45.136
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

00:52:45.336 --> 00:52:51.916
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

00:52:52.116 --> 00:52:56.906
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

00:52:57.106 --> 00:53:01.896
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

00:53:02.096 --> 00:53:05.146
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

00:53:05.346 --> 00:53:06.886
Impossible.

00:53:07.086 --> 00:53:12.156
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

00:53:12.356 --> 00:53:14.926
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

00:53:15.126 --> 00:53:18.336
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

00:53:18.536 --> 00:53:25.056
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

00:53:25.256 --> 00:53:29.076
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

00:53:29.276 --> 00:53:35.616
have to enter into and work out.

00:53:35.816 --> 00:53:37.336
You can do it.

00:53:37.536 --> 00:53:42.796
You see, I was surprised that in this place

00:53:42.996 --> 00:53:48.186
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

00:53:48.386 --> 00:53:52.816
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

00:53:53.016 --> 00:53:56.056
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

00:53:56.256 --> 00:54:03.076
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

00:54:03.276 --> 00:54:08.856
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

00:54:09.056 --> 00:54:12.106
As it is growing in quantity,

00:54:12.306 --> 00:54:16.016
it should also grow in quality.

00:54:16.216 --> 00:54:21.076
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

00:54:21.276 --> 00:54:23.386
Because I know all the time

00:54:23.596 --> 00:54:26.436
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

00:54:26.636 --> 00:54:29.916
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

00:54:30.116 --> 00:54:34.266
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

00:54:34.466 --> 00:54:36.476
I know that feeling you have that,

00:54:36.676 --> 00:54:40.106
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

00:54:40.306 --> 00:54:42.176
So forget about them.

00:54:42.386 --> 00:54:49.106
But those who are seeking, approach them.

00:54:49.316 --> 00:54:51.466
They are your real relations.

00:54:51.666 --> 00:54:55.576
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

00:54:55.776 --> 00:54:59.476
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

00:54:59.676 --> 00:55:02.716
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

00:55:02.916 --> 00:55:07.116
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

00:55:07.316 --> 00:55:11.056
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

00:55:11.256 --> 00:55:13.966
You should find out where are they.

00:55:14.166 --> 00:55:16.876
My attention is, of course, is with you

00:55:17.076 --> 00:55:21.856
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

00:55:22.066 --> 00:55:23.466
Whatever you want,

00:55:23.666 --> 00:55:28.156
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

00:55:28.356 --> 00:55:33.716
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

00:55:33.926 --> 00:55:36.936
Because you take it upon yourself.

00:55:37.136 --> 00:55:42.676
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

00:55:42.876 --> 00:55:50.036
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

00:55:50.246 --> 00:55:56.806
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

00:55:57.526 --> 00:56:00.756
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

00:56:00.956 --> 00:56:04.796
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

00:56:04.996 --> 00:56:08.986
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

00:56:09.196 --> 00:56:12.236
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

00:56:12.446 --> 00:56:14.636
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

00:56:14.836 --> 00:56:17.836
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

00:56:18.036 --> 00:56:19.526
is Adi Shakti.

00:56:19.726 --> 00:56:23.026
It's very important that this puja must be performed

00:56:23.226 --> 00:56:29.296
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

00:56:29.496 --> 00:56:32.456
and you grow more and more within yourself

00:56:32.656 --> 00:56:37.386
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

00:56:37.586 --> 00:56:42.386
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

00:56:42.586 --> 00:56:45.066
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

00:56:45.266 --> 00:56:49.096
within you is the Kundalini.

00:56:49.296 --> 00:56:50.546
So, you have to worship.

00:56:50.746 --> 00:56:54.906
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

00:56:55.106 --> 00:56:58.476
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

00:56:58.676 --> 00:57:02.176
May God bless you.
