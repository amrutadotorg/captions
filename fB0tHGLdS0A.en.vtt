03:58.912 --> 04:05.446
Today we are going to worship the Adi Shakti

04:05.646 --> 04:12.786
and the reflection of the Adi Shakti within you is the Kundalini.

04:14.876 --> 04:17.166
We can say this is the worship

04:17.366 --> 04:21.256
of the Adi Shakti and Adi Kundalini.

04:21.456 --> 04:31.186
If you understand that all this,

04:31.386 --> 04:38.216
whatever is created on this universe,

04:38.426 --> 04:45.666
and in many universes, is the work of the Adi Shakti.

04:46.106 --> 04:49.796
Now many people believe that there is one God.

04:49.996 --> 04:55.006
It’s true, there’s one God, God Almighty,

04:55.206 --> 05:03.556
but He has His own powers which He can embody into someone

05:03.756 --> 05:10.866
and can get His own manifestation expressed.

05:11.226 --> 05:19.056
So, first of all, He did was to create

05:19.256 --> 05:22.826
the power of Adi Shakti.

05:23.036 --> 05:29.366
When It was created then there was a sound,

05:29.566 --> 05:33.426
the sound that we call as Aum, logos or anything you call it,

05:33.626 --> 05:35.846
by the primordial sound,

05:36.046 --> 05:40.106
and these three powers came out of that sound -

05:40.306 --> 05:45.826
is A, U and M -Aum.

05:46.216 --> 05:50.646
The Adi Shakti is the One

05:50.846 --> 05:58.126
Who embodies the desire of God Almighty.

05:58.976 --> 06:05.826
The desire of God Almighty comes out of His compassion

06:06.026 --> 06:12.586
and for His own expression,

06:12.786 --> 06:16.106
for His own manifestation,

06:16.306 --> 06:20.426
for His own reflection.

06:21.546 --> 06:26.326
I would say that He must be tired of loneliness

06:26.526 --> 06:31.426
so He must have thought of creating a partner

06:31.626 --> 06:37.096
who will manifest His desires.

06:37.606 --> 06:47.106
Thus, the power of God Almighty separated from Him

06:47.306 --> 06:53.616
and formed an embodiment of His compassion,

06:53.816 --> 06:59.096
His desire to create.

06:59.776 --> 07:03.836
They say in Sanskrit, they use a word 'chitvilas',

07:04.036 --> 07:08.476
is the enjoyment of the Adi Shakti.

07:08.676 --> 07:12.506
'Chit' is, as you know is 'chitta', is attention.

07:12.706 --> 07:18.696
The attention has its own joy

07:18.896 --> 07:23.506
and to manifest that joy of Her attention,

07:23.706 --> 07:26.866
She created all the universes,

07:27.066 --> 07:31.776
She created this Mother Earth, She created all this nature;

07:31.976 --> 07:37.466
She created all the animals; She created all the human beings

07:37.676 --> 07:41.226
and She created all the Sahaja Yogis.

07:41.426 --> 07:47.816
This is how the whole creation has worked out.

07:49.226 --> 07:51.946
At this juncture one may ask that,

07:52.156 --> 07:57.316
"Why did She not straight forward create human beings?"

07:57.866 --> 08:00.726
That was the idea of God Almighty,

08:00.926 --> 08:07.636
just to create human beings without telling them anything,

08:07.836 --> 08:14.116
something, better animals than the rest of the animals.

08:14.386 --> 08:17.126
But Adi Shakti being the Mother,

08:17.326 --> 08:21.286
She had Her own way of expression,

08:21.486 --> 08:25.216
that She thought She must create the mirrors

08:25.416 --> 08:30.856
for God Almighty to see His face, to see His image,

08:31.056 --> 08:32.706
to see His character

08:32.916 --> 08:38.676
and that's how this long range of evolution took place.

08:40.946 --> 08:45.276
This evolution had to work out this way

08:45.476 --> 08:51.106
because they had to know from where they come.

08:51.346 --> 08:57.536
We must know that we come from nature.

08:57.736 --> 09:03.436
Even nature should know it comes from the Mother Earth,

09:03.646 --> 09:08.496
and Mother Earth Herself has Her own Kundalini.

09:08.696 --> 09:14.556
And She too is not just a dead earth,

09:14.756 --> 09:19.296
but She knows, She thinks, She understands and She regulates.

09:19.506 --> 09:25.116
You can see in the nature how every tree has got its own limitations,

09:25.316 --> 09:32.306
how every fruit is produced in a particular tree,

09:32.506 --> 09:38.246
how it happens? What works out, this kind of regulation?

09:38.446 --> 09:43.086
If this Mother Earth was moving with a higher speed than

09:43.286 --> 09:47.486
what it is today, we would not have been born even.

09:47.686 --> 09:51.626
Would have been less speed, it would not have worked out.

09:51.826 --> 09:54.206
See the whole plan that was made.

09:54.406 --> 09:59.836
It's a beautiful plan that the Mother Earth has to move around the sun

10:00.046 --> 10:04.796
in such a manner that different seasons are created.

10:04.996 --> 10:07.986
That's why the power, the Paramchaitanya,

10:08.186 --> 10:10.506
which is the power of the Adi Shakti,

10:10.706 --> 10:14.226
is also called as Ritambara Pragya.

10:14.426 --> 10:20.316
This is the power that does all the living work,

10:20.516 --> 10:26.536
all the organization, all the creation.

10:31.096 --> 10:36.366
In our human ego we start thinking that

10:36.566 --> 10:40.416
we do something, we can create.

10:40.616 --> 10:46.916
We cannot. We cannot even create a dust of particle,

10:47.116 --> 10:49.496
leave alone anything else.

10:49.696 --> 10:54.766
Whatever is created, out of that we may combine,

10:54.966 --> 11:00.466
we can put together and create something,

11:00.666 --> 11:10.046
but if you see that this whole thing is nothing but beyond our -

11:10.246 --> 11:15.126
any power.

11:15.326 --> 11:18.366
We cannot create anything.

11:18.566 --> 11:26.336
But what do we create is our myths, I should say.

11:26.536 --> 11:31.946
For example, something is made of gold.

11:32.146 --> 11:35.276
Still it is gold.

11:35.476 --> 11:38.616
Now something is made of wood,

11:38.816 --> 11:43.216
whatever it is made, is wood.

11:43.416 --> 11:46.986
The principle is the same into everything.

11:47.186 --> 11:51.906
So whatever may be your birth,

11:52.106 --> 11:54.986
whatever may be the country you are born,

11:55.186 --> 12:01.726
whatever may be your culture, you are human beings,

12:01.926 --> 12:05.546
basically you all are the same.

12:05.746 --> 12:11.186
You laugh the same, you smile the same,

12:11.386 --> 12:15.596
also, you cry the same way.

12:16.069 --> 12:19.466
I haven't seen anybody crying with his hands,

12:19.666 --> 12:24.326
tears falling out of his fingers, do they?

12:25.410 --> 12:30.456
And that is how one has to realize that we are all bound

12:30.656 --> 12:35.316
by some common principle of life.

12:35.516 --> 12:40.926
And the common principle of life that has bound us

12:41.136 --> 12:47.976
by the Adi Shakti is that we all have Kundalini within us.

12:48.176 --> 12:50.886
All the human beings have Kundalini within us.

12:51.086 --> 12:53.336
It is not, it is not in the animals also,

12:53.536 --> 12:57.676
but it's not so developed; it's not yet, what you call,

12:57.876 --> 13:06.956
is full form of Kundalini that can be awakened.

13:07.156 --> 13:10.436
But in the human form only

13:10.636 --> 13:17.576
it has evolved as a connection,

13:17.776 --> 13:23.166
as one that is the divine force within us,

13:23.366 --> 13:28.666
which is the reflection of the Adi Kundalini,

13:28.866 --> 13:34.816
which is so easily awakened in this kali yuga.

13:35.016 --> 13:38.376
This is the common principle we all have.

13:38.576 --> 13:45.876
So we have to respect all the people, all the human beings,

13:46.076 --> 13:51.056
whatever nation they come from, whatever country they belong,

13:51.266 --> 13:58.186
whatever color they have, because they all have their Kundalini.

13:58.766 --> 14:01.336
Then there are people, as you people are,

14:01.536 --> 14:06.346
who are awakened people, who are enlightened people,

14:06.556 --> 14:09.516
who have got your realization.

14:09.716 --> 14:13.936
So when you understand that this is the

14:14.136 --> 14:21.076
enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Ma,

14:21.276 --> 14:24.856
of the Primordial Mother, it's just the play

14:25.056 --> 14:26.746
and the enjoyment.

14:26.946 --> 14:36.686
Then when you have achieved your full growth in spirituality

14:36.896 --> 14:40.446
what should happen to you?

14:40.646 --> 14:45.096
What should we feel?

14:45.296 --> 14:51.386
How do we then exist?

14:52.106 --> 14:57.396
This is the question many a times you have asked.

14:57.756 --> 15:01.256
Now when you ask questions itself it shows

15:01.456 --> 15:02.886
that you are not there,

15:03.086 --> 15:07.016
because once you are there you don't ask questions.

15:07.216 --> 15:09.186
Secondly, what happens to you

15:09.386 --> 15:14.106
is that you become just the existence.

15:14.306 --> 15:17.066
Just the existence.

15:17.266 --> 15:19.816
And that existence that you become,

15:20.016 --> 15:25.376
then you start reflecting the character of Divinity.

15:25.896 --> 15:30.996
This divine character is expressed not only nowadays,

15:31.196 --> 15:33.036
also much before.

15:33.236 --> 15:35.746
In every religion we have had people

15:35.946 --> 15:40.416
who had this divine character very well developed.

15:40.616 --> 15:45.766
For example, even you can say,

15:45.966 --> 15:52.936
the people who lived three thousand, four thousand year back in Colombia,

15:53.136 --> 16:00.006
I found that in their statues they had Kundalini

16:00.206 --> 16:02.676
and a khumba also,

16:02.876 --> 16:05.756
commonly, whatever we have found out they had

16:05.956 --> 16:12.556
a Kundalini being expressed three and a half coils.

16:12.756 --> 16:17.366
This Kundalini we have within ourselves is now proved to you.

16:17.566 --> 16:22.506
You know that there is this power within us.

16:22.716 --> 16:28.076
Also, you've come to know what happens when we deviate

16:28.286 --> 16:33.716
from the middle path of our ascent.

16:33.916 --> 16:36.546
Here also the same Kundalini,

16:36.746 --> 16:41.952
which is the expression of the Primordial Mother,

16:42.366 --> 16:48.826
tells on your finger tips what's going wrong with you,

16:49.026 --> 16:53.836
where are you lacking, what is your problem.

16:54.036 --> 16:58.326
So now when we are enlightened people,

16:58.536 --> 17:03.706
we have become saints and we are above all others,

17:03.906 --> 17:10.976
what should we do is to understand fully well -

17:11.176 --> 17:14.286
not only mentally, but from your heart -

17:14.486 --> 17:20.596
that now you have got these divine vibrations

17:20.796 --> 17:25.886
and these divine vibrations can tell you where are you,

17:26.086 --> 17:31.326
what are you, where is the problem.

17:31.526 --> 17:34.446
Also, it will tell you wherever you go, like that:

17:34.646 --> 17:39.176
I talked to some people who went to Jerusalem and they said,

17:39.376 --> 17:42.746
"Mother, the whole place was just vibrating

17:42.946 --> 17:46.326
with spiritual vibrations."

17:46.526 --> 17:48.936
They went to Chindwara, somebody, and he said,

17:49.136 --> 17:51.096
"I'll find out Mother's place, what is there,

17:51.296 --> 17:55.486
after all, it's not difficult. Through vibrations I'll find out."

17:55.686 --> 17:59.726
So he said, "As soon as I touched the platform I started jumping.

17:59.926 --> 18:01.836
I said, 'Now what to do, where to -

18:02.036 --> 18:03.926
from here only there are vibrations,

18:04.126 --> 18:06.496
how will I reach Mother's place?'"

18:06.696 --> 18:09.066
So then he sat down and started wondering,

18:09.266 --> 18:14.316
"Now, how will I find out where did Mother take Her birth?"

18:14.516 --> 18:20.226
He was sitting down and then he saw the star which is the Venus.

18:20.426 --> 18:24.256
He followed the Venus star and then he went and asked

18:24.466 --> 18:28.366
and that's how he found the place.

18:28.766 --> 18:31.036
So, the whole plan, the whole thing

18:31.236 --> 18:34.146
is not done haphazard, in any way.

18:34.346 --> 18:37.516
If you see a tree, every tree has leaves

18:37.716 --> 18:43.846
and every leaf is given chance to have the sun's rays.

18:44.426 --> 18:49.866
In the nature, if you see, it's so harmonious, so beautiful.

18:50.286 --> 18:52.616
We are the ones which spoil the nature

18:52.816 --> 18:57.116
because we don't understand that we have come from nature

18:57.316 --> 18:59.416
and we have to respect it.

18:59.616 --> 19:01.706
I've already told you many a times

19:01.906 --> 19:04.796
about how human beings were formed

19:04.996 --> 19:11.946
by different chemicals who came also,

19:12.146 --> 19:15.206
carbon came from the mother earth.

19:15.406 --> 19:18.646
All this leads us to understand

19:18.846 --> 19:23.496
that we have a very big responsibility.

19:24.056 --> 19:30.046
The whole work has taken thousands and thousands and thousands of years.

19:30.246 --> 19:32.956
And now you all have reached a state

19:33.156 --> 19:37.096
where you have become yourself.

19:37.296 --> 19:39.446
You know yourself.

19:39.646 --> 19:43.696
This is a very big, I think should say,

19:43.896 --> 19:51.206
a very big jump in the evolutionary process.

19:53.576 --> 20:00.326
The evolutionary process started long, long time back.

20:29.796 --> 20:35.206
So I think is very important for you to worship the Adi Shakti

20:35.406 --> 20:42.526
and the Adi Kundalini. Is absolutely without understanding,

20:42.726 --> 20:52.406
absolutely you cannot understand how you have become a saint.

20:53.846 --> 20:58.896
When you will know within yourself you have got all these centers,

20:59.096 --> 21:02.826
and these centers have to be awakened

21:03.026 --> 21:06.526
through the awakening of the Kundalini,

21:06.726 --> 21:14.506
and that the Kundalini expresses Herself through your fingertips.

21:15.366 --> 21:24.296
Unless and until you fully identify with this knowledge

21:24.496 --> 21:29.226
there's always a possibility that you will deviate

21:29.426 --> 21:35.356
from the path of your perfection.

21:36.456 --> 21:39.896
Many people who come to Sahaja Yoga, I have seen,

21:40.096 --> 21:44.606
they meet some Sahaja Yogis who are half way

21:44.816 --> 21:48.726
and because they are mental, they start arguing,

21:48.926 --> 21:53.546
"How is it this is this way, how is it, it is this way?

21:53.746 --> 21:58.506
How is it he's a Sahaja Yogi, he behaves like that?"

21:58.816 --> 22:02.596
There are so many ways of people relating

22:02.796 --> 22:06.456
to the power of the Divine.

22:06.666 --> 22:10.946
I have told you in the beginning that God felt lonely

22:11.146 --> 22:16.616
and that's why He created this Adi Shakti

22:16.816 --> 22:19.996
and through Her the whole universe was created.

22:20.196 --> 22:27.936
But also true that as you are seeking,

22:28.146 --> 22:31.386
also the Divine is seeking you.

22:31.586 --> 22:39.936
Also that your seeking is absolutely awarded

22:40.136 --> 22:47.696
if you understand the simple thing about Divine:

22:47.896 --> 22:53.656
that it is the One that has given you intelligence.

22:53.856 --> 22:57.826
It is the One that has given you wisdom.

22:58.026 --> 23:00.996
It is the One which has given you

23:01.196 --> 23:04.176
whatever you have- as you were singing that,

23:04.376 --> 23:08.726
"Whatever we have is given by You".

23:09.046 --> 23:13.436
If that is the case that all that you have

23:13.636 --> 23:18.086
is given by your Kundalini,

23:18.296 --> 23:21.986
by this mother power of your Kundalini,

23:22.186 --> 23:26.946
then is very important to understand what is the need

23:27.196 --> 23:34.816
of keeping Her happy and Her satisfaction.

23:36.266 --> 23:43.786
You must try to see what makes Her happy.

23:45.216 --> 23:48.396
As I said, there's a relationship

23:48.596 --> 23:55.126
between the realized souls and the Divine.

23:55.326 --> 23:59.186
The Divine is happy when you are happy.

23:59.396 --> 24:05.056
Or we can say, when the Divine makes you happy

24:05.256 --> 24:08.696
and you are happy, then the Divine is happy.

24:08.896 --> 24:11.746
It's such a relationship.

24:11.946 --> 24:15.076
And it's so close, it's so close,

24:15.276 --> 24:20.536
we can say as the sun has sun's rays,

24:20.736 --> 24:27.636
or the moon has its own moonlight.

24:27.836 --> 24:39.066
It is so close, it's so ingrained, so much built in

24:39.266 --> 24:44.486
and that should give you full control over yourself

24:44.686 --> 24:50.026
and over your development.

24:50.526 --> 24:58.076
They describe it in various ways that you must surrender.

24:58.936 --> 25:02.696
Now

25:08.291 --> 25:13.426
one surrenders, of course, with fear.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.356
If somebody comes with a sword and says, "All right, you surrender,"

25:16.556 --> 25:17.956
you may.

25:18.166 --> 25:20.096
But as soon as that person will disappear,

25:20.296 --> 25:23.396
you'll take out another sword and cut his throat.

25:23.596 --> 25:26.866
That surrender has no meaning.

25:27.066 --> 25:33.296
That surrender is a surrender which is just forced onto you.

25:33.496 --> 25:37.426
All such surrenders have been creating problems,

25:37.636 --> 25:41.216
because it has a reaction.

25:41.416 --> 25:49.436
But your surrender to Divine is extremely joy giving.

25:49.666 --> 26:05.536
Like a salt which dissolves into the sea automatically,

26:05.736 --> 26:11.436
into the water automatically,

26:11.636 --> 26:19.376
that soluble nature is really joy giving.

26:19.976 --> 26:24.416
If you can just feel that within yourself,

26:24.616 --> 26:27.806
that you are one with the Divine.

26:28.006 --> 26:33.096
You are dissolved in the ocean of the Divine.

26:33.596 --> 26:43.466
And then what takes your form is nothing but extreme love,

26:43.676 --> 26:50.066
compassion and, as a result, extreme joy.

26:50.266 --> 26:57.246
Many people tell Me that, "Mother, it's very difficult to forgive someone."

26:57.876 --> 27:03.226
But I think it's very horrible not to forgive someone.

27:03.426 --> 27:07.266
There's a great joy in forgiving,

27:07.466 --> 27:11.986
very great joy in forgiving. And as soon as you forgive,

27:12.186 --> 27:18.486
the Divine takes over and Divine will look after you.

27:19.056 --> 27:22.596
Nobody can disturb you.

27:22.796 --> 27:27.246
But first you must surrender to the Divine,

27:27.446 --> 27:29.686
that is what is forgiveness.

27:29.886 --> 27:34.406
Just don't bother yourself as to punish somebody

27:34.606 --> 27:37.346
or to do something against somebody.

27:37.546 --> 27:41.536
The Divine takes over from you

27:41.736 --> 27:44.636
and does whatever is needed,

27:44.836 --> 27:51.506
and in such a beautiful manner that it is worth seeing how it works.

27:51.906 --> 27:57.066
Adi Shakti's power, this Divine, is described in every religion.

27:57.266 --> 27:59.506
say in Islam called ruh;

27:59.706 --> 28:04.486
in the Bible is called as All Pervading Power;

28:04.686 --> 28:08.866
is called as allak - that which cannot be seen;

28:09.066 --> 28:14.826
Niranjana, the One which is beyond any attachment sort of thing.

28:15.026 --> 28:19.626
All these words are used for this Divine Power.

28:19.826 --> 28:23.386
People have heard about it, people have sung about it;

28:23.586 --> 28:29.146
but unfortunately very few people felt it,

28:29.346 --> 28:34.306
and when they felt it they didn't know how to give it to others,

28:34.516 --> 28:36.846
how to make others feel it.

28:37.046 --> 28:40.536
So whatever they talked became sort of a story

28:40.736 --> 28:42.786
or something nonsensical.

28:42.986 --> 28:46.766
Nobody could believe that they have felt anything like that

28:46.966 --> 28:52.886
or could imagine that there is such a Power really existing.

28:53.086 --> 28:58.926
Now, luckily, it has become quite a universal fact for all of you,

28:59.126 --> 29:03.206
that you know there is this Power.

29:03.406 --> 29:05.756
You're sure about this Power

29:05.956 --> 29:10.136
because you can feel it within yourself.

29:10.336 --> 29:13.276
And when you feel it, you feel very joyous.

29:13.486 --> 29:19.656
You can make out whether somebody is telling you the truth or not,

29:19.856 --> 29:25.466
because you can see on the vibrations on this,

29:25.666 --> 29:34.996
I should say, the Power of Adi Shakti.

29:35.206 --> 29:38.436
She tells you the truth.

29:40.486 --> 29:45.476
If somebody has done some harm to you, for example,

29:45.676 --> 29:50.316
now you may say that, "Mother, if you forgive that person

29:50.516 --> 29:54.276
then it's not the truth because he has definitely harmed,

29:54.486 --> 29:59.706
and if I forgive that means I accept that he has not harmed me."

29:59.906 --> 30:02.256
This kind of argument is possible.

30:02.456 --> 30:05.176
Now you will see, you'll be surprised

30:05.376 --> 30:08.046
that you forgive that person,

30:08.246 --> 30:12.836
because the truth is whether you forgive or you don't forgive,

30:13.036 --> 30:15.856
you don't do anything.

30:16.056 --> 30:17.536
That's the truth.

30:17.746 --> 30:22.286
So out of compassion if you forgive someone,

30:22.486 --> 30:25.946
compassion becomes the truth.

30:26.146 --> 30:29.826
Is the compassion that tells you the truth.

30:30.026 --> 30:33.166
So all the absolute truth that you know is

30:33.366 --> 30:38.006
through the compassion of the Divine Power.

30:38.206 --> 30:42.916
Maybe sometimes people say, "We saw the vibrations, Mother,

30:43.116 --> 30:46.286
and we felt this way and still it happened."

30:46.496 --> 30:49.426
It makes no difference.

30:49.626 --> 30:52.486
Whatever has happened has happened, doesn't matter.

30:52.686 --> 30:56.726
You have felt the vibrations, and you asked the vibrations

30:56.926 --> 31:01.156
and you acted upon the vibrations, that's all.

31:01.356 --> 31:05.976
Whether it turned out to be that way or not is different.

31:06.176 --> 31:09.576
Because it had to be the other way round.

31:09.776 --> 31:13.186
Some drama is going on. Is the chitvilas,

31:13.396 --> 31:18.216
is the enjoyment of the chitta of the Divine.

31:18.416 --> 31:21.116
So, it's a play going on.

31:21.316 --> 31:27.576
If you can see that play then you don't get disturbed - it's a play.

31:27.786 --> 31:36.526
How it works, how it is organized, is not your headache.

31:36.726 --> 31:42.036
You just have to see the play of the Divine, how it works out.

31:42.236 --> 31:46.706
We have seen now, all of you, which you call as miracles have happened.

31:46.906 --> 31:50.816
"Mother, this miracle has happened, that miracle has happened

31:51.016 --> 31:58.546
and I know is all the miracle of the Divine."

31:58.826 --> 32:07.386
Despite that, our faith in the Divine is not so much enlightened faith.

32:07.866 --> 32:10.516
When you have the enlightened faith,

32:10.716 --> 32:17.246
you don't worry about things which are very important in life.

32:17.446 --> 32:23.286
It works out, well and good, if it doesn't work out, well and good.

32:23.776 --> 32:28.606
It should not be assumed that once you are a realized soul

32:28.806 --> 32:34.486
that the whole world can fall at your feet.

32:34.876 --> 32:38.266
Not necessarily. It's a play.

32:38.466 --> 32:46.356
It's a beautiful enjoyment of the attention of the Adi Shakti.

32:46.556 --> 32:49.896
So if you can become the witness,

32:50.096 --> 32:53.666
if you can really become the witness of the whole thing,

32:53.866 --> 33:01.276
then what happens you grow spiritually much closer.

33:01.746 --> 33:07.466
I should say you get dissolved in the Divine Power.

33:07.666 --> 33:10.526
That dissolution has to take place.

33:10.726 --> 33:14.446
That's why today's puja is very important for you,

33:14.646 --> 33:20.186
because if it was not Adi Shakti Who had taken an incarnation,

33:20.386 --> 33:24.486
this work could not have been done.

33:24.696 --> 33:29.746
This could not have been. Because it had to be something

33:29.946 --> 33:41.846
that would encompass all the angularities of this human life,

33:42.056 --> 33:45.916
all the aspects of this human life.

33:46.116 --> 33:49.686
It had to be such an Incarnation

33:49.886 --> 33:57.876
that could absolutely see human being as a whole,

33:58.076 --> 34:02.396
not only his physical self, mental self, emotional self

34:02.596 --> 34:10.226
or his particular ideologies, or his particular domination - no,

34:10.426 --> 34:13.456
as a whole, as a human being.

34:13.656 --> 34:17.986
And human being, as I told you, is all inside,

34:18.186 --> 34:21.506
all of them are just the same.

34:21.716 --> 34:30.876
Some are more sensitive and seeking, genuinely,

34:31.076 --> 34:34.956
some are not seeking genuinely,

34:35.156 --> 34:38.606
and some are not seeking at all.

34:38.806 --> 34:43.696
But the seeking also is given to you by Adi Shakti.

34:43.906 --> 34:49.746
Now it happens that in the evolutionary process

34:49.946 --> 34:54.516
one fish came out of the mother.

34:54.716 --> 35:01.686
Out of that sea which was like a mother to the sea. It came out.

35:01.886 --> 35:07.206
And then about ten or twelve fishes came out.

35:07.406 --> 35:12.436
Then after some time, shoals of fishes came out.

35:12.836 --> 35:19.546
In the same manner your evolution has worked out.

35:20.046 --> 35:24.416
As it is, we think we have quite a big number,

35:24.616 --> 35:28.426
and we have crossed the number what we call, [inaudible]

35:28.626 --> 35:31.236
James or what St. John has said,

35:31.436 --> 35:34.286
we have already crossed it, doesn't matter.

35:34.476 --> 35:36.036
It doesn't matter.

35:36.236 --> 35:43.906
You see, it seems that it's a very fertile area, very fertile time,

35:44.116 --> 35:48.086
this Kali Yuga where there are so many people

35:48.286 --> 35:53.096
who are taking to Divinity. I mean it's the right time to do this.

35:53.296 --> 35:58.516
Yesterday when I saw your play, I have seen all that Myself

35:58.716 --> 36:02.716
and I used to wonder, "What is going to happen to these people,

36:02.916 --> 36:05.696
how are they going to take Sahaja Yoga?" They have,

36:05.896 --> 36:09.956
they have taken, they have taken to spirituality.

36:10.156 --> 36:14.116
See all these diverse things that you see in modern times

36:14.316 --> 36:16.296
should not disturb you much

36:16.496 --> 36:21.046
because that has to be that way. It's a drama, it's a play,

36:21.246 --> 36:25.096
and in that drama you should know that it will work out

36:25.296 --> 36:29.636
in such a beautiful manner that after some time

36:29.836 --> 36:35.686
you'll find nothing but the Divine dissolving

36:35.886 --> 36:39.876
all the useless things that we have,

36:40.076 --> 36:43.446
like our conditioning and our ego.

36:43.656 --> 36:46.676
We'll have so many people in Sahaja Yoga.

36:46.876 --> 36:50.596
By the time two thousand year, we'll have

36:50.796 --> 36:54.666
many, many Sahaja Yoga all over the world.

36:54.866 --> 36:59.106
Once we have lots of people, many would jump into it.

36:59.306 --> 37:01.046
That's human nature also.

37:01.246 --> 37:04.886
You see, they won't take to it till we have lots of people,

37:05.086 --> 37:08.616
and once we have a multitude they'll jump into it.

37:08.816 --> 37:12.396
So, some people are always worried "Mother, what about others?

37:12.596 --> 37:17.056
We are now in the heavens, we are enjoying life, what about others?"

37:17.256 --> 37:19.196
It will all work out.

37:19.396 --> 37:23.616
It will all work out, but your attention should be

37:23.816 --> 37:30.986
"how I can dissolve others into this ocean of joy,

37:31.186 --> 37:33.806
of this compassion?".

37:34.006 --> 37:39.336
Now you'll be surprised that it is your own compassion only

37:39.536 --> 37:43.066
which is going to give you strength.

37:43.266 --> 37:46.296
This compassion within you,

37:46.496 --> 37:50.076
when you will see people are getting completely drowned,

37:50.276 --> 37:53.556
completely destroyed,

37:53.756 --> 37:57.556
your compassion itself will make you powerful

37:57.756 --> 38:02.016
and you'll do everything that is needed.

38:02.216 --> 38:06.546
You'll give up all nonsensical activities

38:06.746 --> 38:14.916
and you will really dedicate yourself to emancipate other people.

38:15.186 --> 38:17.826
And amazingly as you will do this,

38:18.026 --> 38:22.816
your own level of spirituality will rise.

38:24.696 --> 38:27.646
As you see, I would say,

38:27.846 --> 38:33.146
that when you dissolve say some salt in the water,

38:33.346 --> 38:35.696
the water rises.

38:35.896 --> 38:41.966
In the same way, the more people when they will come to Sahaja Yoga,

38:42.166 --> 38:45.946
the Divine Power will manifest much more.

38:46.146 --> 38:50.556
It is manifesting already but the more people there will be,

38:50.756 --> 38:53.106
there will be much more manifestation

38:53.306 --> 38:59.546
because it will be like so many channels that will be working it out.

38:59.906 --> 39:06.426
So, at this juncture, when we all know that there is Divine Power,

39:06.626 --> 39:09.136
you all have got your Realization

39:09.336 --> 39:13.736
and that you are all now saintly people,

39:13.936 --> 39:17.336
then we should see to people who were like you.

39:17.536 --> 39:21.526
Like we had Sufis, then we had Nath Panthis,

39:21.726 --> 39:25.566
we had Gnostics, all kinds of people in every religion.

39:25.766 --> 39:31.156
What did they do? They went all out

39:31.356 --> 39:35.526
to awaken other people to the fact that there is Divine Power.

39:35.726 --> 39:37.806
They could not give realization as such,

39:38.006 --> 39:40.516
they couldn't give proof of that; but they worked it out,

39:40.716 --> 39:45.116
they talked about it, they sang about it.

39:45.316 --> 39:48.496
That's what we have to understand

39:48.726 --> 39:57.846
that nothing should deter your compassion to be expressed.

39:58.046 --> 40:00.336
When you know the people are getting drowned,

40:00.536 --> 40:05.806
they are in terrible mess, this is a kind of a huge,

40:06.006 --> 40:11.766
I should say,

40:11.966 --> 40:17.626
onslaught of the evil on human beings.

40:17.836 --> 40:20.876
And if you have that compassion within you,

40:21.086 --> 40:26.126
you will go all out to save them.

40:26.326 --> 40:32.286
That is what is the work of this chitvilas,

40:32.486 --> 40:37.356
of this enjoyment of your attention.

40:37.556 --> 40:40.866
Your attention itself will enjoy

40:41.066 --> 40:50.206
when you will start bringing more people into the Power of Divinity.

40:50.406 --> 40:53.436
Without Divinity there's no saving for human beings,

40:53.636 --> 40:56.956
that everybody admits, everybody says so;

40:57.156 --> 41:02.806
but they have no idea as to what is Divinity,

41:03.006 --> 41:09.316
what is the way to achieve it. While you all have this.

41:09.516 --> 41:11.996
You have power to awaken Kundalini.

41:12.196 --> 41:16.766
You know all about chakras, you know all the defects of the chakras,

41:16.966 --> 41:23.256
you can find out from the vibrations the truth about everything.

41:23.456 --> 41:28.556
The more you use this power the better it will be.

41:28.756 --> 41:33.676
So, you have to go to areas where so far you have not gone.

41:33.876 --> 41:37.866
For we haven't got many people from the black race

41:38.066 --> 41:39.996
I think, from Africa.

41:40.196 --> 41:44.526
So, I'm thinking of going next year to Africa to work it out.

41:44.726 --> 41:47.926
Also, we have so many other areas

41:48.126 --> 41:51.356
where I find we have to work it out,

41:51.556 --> 41:58.216
that if this compassion is within you

41:58.416 --> 42:00.756
then it will compel you, also,

42:00.956 --> 42:04.666
to do work that will bring solace to people

42:04.866 --> 42:07.586
who are not even seeking.

42:07.786 --> 42:12.926
I'm already busy with forming some NGO's you see,

42:13.126 --> 42:18.356
which will really create very beautiful institutions

42:18.556 --> 42:23.226
for people who have nothing - they are starving,

42:23.426 --> 42:27.466
they are under trouble, they are under great ordeals.

42:27.666 --> 42:32.306
Only you can do it because coming to Sahaja Yoga

42:32.506 --> 42:37.756
you have dropped out your greed,

42:37.956 --> 42:43.966
you have dropped out your lust.

42:44.166 --> 42:49.136
Is finished. Now you are so free and so independent.

42:49.346 --> 42:53.046
With this the compassion cannot take any other form,

42:53.246 --> 42:56.686
because many people I've seen that they start this kind of work

42:56.886 --> 42:58.776
and then they start becoming leaders,

42:58.976 --> 43:04.676
or they start becoming rich people or plundering others.

43:04.876 --> 43:07.736
This you will not do.

43:07.936 --> 43:14.966
You are the - really, as Christ has said, salt,

43:15.166 --> 43:21.396
salt which is completely dissolved in the Divinity

43:21.596 --> 43:27.836
and this salt is going to dissolve many others.

43:28.036 --> 43:32.106
Once we start spreading out like that,

43:32.306 --> 43:35.176
I am not saying we should be like missionaries or something,

43:35.386 --> 43:38.406
converting people into Sahaja Yoga by force, no.

43:38.606 --> 43:45.236
We have to look after what they are lacking first of all.

43:45.436 --> 43:49.066
Actually, there are very few people in this world who are honest,

43:49.266 --> 43:51.166
who don't have greed.

43:51.366 --> 43:54.306
I have known people who never had any greed,

43:54.506 --> 44:00.186
but as soon as they got some powers they started showing

44:00.386 --> 44:03.696
such tremendous greed that surprisingly,

44:03.926 --> 44:07.496
when you know that person, who has never done such a thing

44:07.696 --> 44:11.126
and suddenly you find he has become so greedy, you can't believe it.

44:11.326 --> 44:13.756
But not Sahaja Yogis.

44:13.956 --> 44:16.186
Sahaja Yogis won't do that.

44:16.386 --> 44:22.256
They'll enjoy their compassion, not anything else.

44:22.456 --> 44:25.606
Not their lust, not their greed

44:25.806 --> 44:29.526
and also the so-called deviations

44:29.726 --> 44:36.346
like taking to drugs and drinking and other nonsensical things.

44:36.626 --> 44:39.276
Because they know what do they enjoy,

44:39.476 --> 44:41.866
where lies their enjoyment.

44:42.066 --> 44:44.466
Once you know where lies the enjoyment,

44:44.666 --> 44:48.276
you will try to have more of it

44:48.476 --> 44:53.286
and more of it is so easy now for you to do it.

44:53.486 --> 44:56.396
I would say as the men are working it out,

44:56.596 --> 44:58.336
women should work it out

44:58.536 --> 45:03.896
because women have more sense of compassion,

45:04.096 --> 45:08.446
more sense of compassion, and forgiveness.

45:08.646 --> 45:11.646
- normal women, I am not saying about abnormal, you know,

45:11.846 --> 45:14.736
I'm saying about normal.

45:14.936 --> 45:20.196
It should be because they're mothers, they have children,

45:20.396 --> 45:24.896
they have known what is love for the children is.

45:25.096 --> 45:26.856
Mother doesn't expect anything.

45:27.056 --> 45:30.736
She just wants her child to be all right and happy.

45:30.936 --> 45:33.936
She enjoys her child, that's all.

45:34.136 --> 45:40.956
If you are a woman, in-built within you is this compassion.

45:41.166 --> 45:43.116
See, I have seen young girls.

45:43.316 --> 45:46.716
They too, if they find a little baby they'll all run after that.

45:46.926 --> 45:50.356
They'd like to take the little baby, they have dolls

45:50.556 --> 45:55.176
and they look after the dolls just like their own children.

45:55.386 --> 46:01.516
So for women it should be much easier to show compassion

46:01.716 --> 46:05.856
and to express and to manifest, it should be.

46:06.066 --> 46:10.356
And as you are all married also,

46:10.556 --> 46:15.566
your husbands will feel so much strengthened

46:15.766 --> 46:22.496
by your own nature of Divinity.

46:22.696 --> 46:24.816
What do you sacrifice? Some say,

46:25.026 --> 46:28.906
"I sacrifice this for God; I sacrifice that for God."

46:29.106 --> 46:32.946
What is there to sacrifice for God? What does God need?

46:33.146 --> 46:36.596
He doesn't need anything. What is there to sacrifice?

46:36.796 --> 46:40.346
Only you have sacrificed you brains, that's all I can say,

46:40.546 --> 46:43.576
no wisdom is there. Nothing to sacrifice.

46:43.776 --> 46:51.456
And if something

46:51.656 --> 46:53.956
has to be done, has to be done.

46:54.156 --> 46:56.336
I've seen also some ladies coming to me,

46:56.536 --> 47:00.086
"Mother, we have to cook, then we have to look after the children

47:00.286 --> 47:03.466
and the household and this and that".

47:03.666 --> 47:07.266
What's that? Otherwise, what will you do?

47:07.266 --> 47:09.996
The whole day, what will you do?

47:10.196 --> 47:13.746
Like the bats which hang themselves the whole day,

47:13.946 --> 47:17.796
are you going to hang yourself? You have to do something.

47:17.996 --> 47:22.216
While doing it is just nothing great, you know.

47:22.416 --> 47:27.366
And then to sacrifice, I don't know what are you going to sacrifice.

47:27.566 --> 47:33.216
Actually, what you are sacrificing is your joy, is your happiness.

47:33.416 --> 47:41.586
If you achieve that state of enjoying your own Self,

47:41.786 --> 47:45.726
then you'll be never tired.

47:45.926 --> 47:48.766
You will never grudge.

47:48.966 --> 47:54.226
You'll always say, "Mother, we are enjoying everything."

47:54.676 --> 47:58.466
This is a very important point that we should realize

47:58.666 --> 48:01.966
that if somebody is a woman or a man

48:02.166 --> 48:08.076
they have the same thing, which we call as Kundalini.

48:08.276 --> 48:13.116
But a woman, as it is, as you know, is mostly left sided.

48:13.316 --> 48:17.686
She has more power of compassion.

48:17.886 --> 48:21.206
In the same way the man has more power of action.

48:21.416 --> 48:24.406
So, the compassion has to become active.

48:24.606 --> 48:27.666
In this combination everything will work out

48:27.876 --> 48:30.146
in a very beautiful manner.

48:30.346 --> 48:35.126
But if that balance is not there, it's going to be difficult.

48:35.326 --> 48:40.096
I've seen most of the marriages we have had have been successful,

48:40.296 --> 48:43.356
but some of them have not been. Because, I think,

48:43.556 --> 48:45.536
some of the women have been men

48:45.736 --> 48:50.386
and some of the men have been women.

48:50.586 --> 48:54.956
And I'm really sometimes very unhappy,

48:55.166 --> 49:00.886
I get pain to see that unnecessarily they are creating problems.

49:01.086 --> 49:02.506
They are both Sahaja Yogis.

49:02.706 --> 49:05.246
If they were not Sahaja Yogis, I can understand.

49:05.446 --> 49:08.146
If a Sahaja Yogi is married to a non Sahaja Yogi, I can understand,

49:08.356 --> 49:10.146
but both are Sahaja Yogis.

49:10.356 --> 49:13.156
Now here you should understand the relationship

49:13.366 --> 49:17.666
of the God Almighty and Adi Shakti.

49:17.866 --> 49:23.836
Is complete unision (sic.) , complete understanding.

49:24.046 --> 49:26.336
God Almighty is the Spectator;

49:26.536 --> 49:31.296
He's watching the work of the Adi Shakti.

49:31.496 --> 49:33.906
She is compassion, of course.

49:34.106 --> 49:37.886
She doesn't say that something should be destroyed

49:38.086 --> 49:41.506
or something should be killed, all right, She's compassion.

49:41.706 --> 49:45.806
But He's the One who takes charge.

49:46.006 --> 49:51.046
If somebody tries to do something against the Adi Shakti,

49:51.246 --> 49:55.316
it is He who takes charge and changes the whole scene

49:55.516 --> 50:00.416
in such a manner that you don't understand how it has happened,

50:00.626 --> 50:03.916
how it has worked out.

50:04.116 --> 50:08.166
What you have to do is to enjoy the play.

50:08.366 --> 50:12.436
In the same manner, Sahaja Yogis should have a unision (sic.),

50:12.636 --> 50:17.126
should have understanding, enjoyment among yourselves.

50:17.326 --> 50:22.656
If a Sahaja Yogi cannot enjoy, who is going to enjoy life?

50:22.856 --> 50:24.626
I can't understand

50:24.826 --> 50:28.666
the one who has his Kundalini awakened only,

50:28.876 --> 50:35.546
who has felt the all-pervading power of love,

50:35.746 --> 50:39.546
who knows what is the truth,

50:39.746 --> 50:48.646
who is standing on the complete oneness with the Divine,

50:48.846 --> 50:57.836
how can such a person anyway have any kind of problem?

50:59.526 --> 51:03.246
It is to realize

51:03.446 --> 51:11.696
that you are sitting in the realm of God Almighty.

51:11.996 --> 51:15.936
You have entered into His kingdom

51:16.136 --> 51:22.476
and you are under the attention, compassion of Adi Shakti.

51:22.676 --> 51:25.946
But it is like this, if you make a beggar

51:26.146 --> 51:28.826
who has been begging all his life sit on a throne,

51:29.026 --> 51:32.706
he still begs sitting on this throne.

51:32.906 --> 51:36.706
So that is sometimes is the situation with Sahaja Yogis.

51:36.906 --> 51:39.576
I receive some funny letters sometimes

51:39.776 --> 51:44.316
then I start wondering if this fellow is still in the limbo state,

51:44.516 --> 51:49.786
is not yet a Sahaja Yogi nor a human being, in between somewhere, hanging.

51:49.986 --> 51:55.886
So, at least, that state should be overcome by all of you,

51:56.096 --> 51:58.456
because it has a very bad impression,

51:58.656 --> 52:03.906
also, for other people and for your own life.

52:04.106 --> 52:07.746
For your own life, is very important

52:07.946 --> 52:12.126
that you should grow fully into the understanding

52:12.326 --> 52:18.256
of the powers that you have got and the love that your Mother has.

52:18.456 --> 52:22.526
When you say you must surrender yourself to Mother, means what?

52:22.726 --> 52:26.856
What do you have to surrender?

52:28.426 --> 52:31.296
Just think of it.

52:31.496 --> 52:38.826
What you are surrendering is what is perverting you,

52:39.026 --> 52:45.136
whatever is destructing you, whatever that misleads you,

52:45.336 --> 52:51.916
whatever is your ego and your conditioning.

52:52.116 --> 52:56.906
That's all you are surrendering, just to purify yourself,

52:57.106 --> 53:01.896
to enjoy yourself and to know God Almighty.

53:02.096 --> 53:05.146
If you don't know your Self, how will you know God also?

53:05.346 --> 53:06.886
Impossible.

53:07.086 --> 53:12.156
So to know your Self you have to evolve.

53:12.356 --> 53:14.926
I know there are some very great Sahaja Yogis,

53:15.126 --> 53:18.336
some Sahaja Yoginis also. Many are there,

53:18.536 --> 53:25.056
but still I would say that there are so many other areas

53:25.256 --> 53:29.076
where all these very greatly evolved Sahaja Yogis

53:29.276 --> 53:35.616
have to enter into and work out.

53:35.816 --> 53:37.336
You can do it.

53:37.536 --> 53:42.796
You see, I was surprised that in this place

53:42.996 --> 53:48.186
when I came first in Rome we had advertised,

53:48.386 --> 53:52.816
and there was not even a single person in the hall.

53:53.016 --> 53:56.056
So I said, "Baba, what is going to happen in this country?"

53:56.256 --> 54:03.076
Now we have so many Sahaja Yogis. Unbelievable!

54:03.276 --> 54:08.856
But as it is growing sideways, it should also grow upwards.

54:09.056 --> 54:12.106
As it is growing in quantity,

54:12.306 --> 54:16.016
it should also grow in quality.

54:16.216 --> 54:21.076
And as you grow in quality, more and more people will come.

54:21.276 --> 54:23.386
Because I know all the time

54:23.596 --> 54:26.436
you are so collective that you, all the time, you feel,

54:26.636 --> 54:29.916
"Mother, you see, my uncle is still not a Sahaja Yogi.

54:30.116 --> 54:34.266
See Mother, my brother is not yet a Sahaja Yogi."

54:34.466 --> 54:36.476
I know that feeling you have that,

54:36.676 --> 54:40.106
"My father, still he is not a Sahaja Yogi."

54:40.306 --> 54:42.176
So forget about them.

54:42.386 --> 54:49.106
But those who are seeking, approach them.

54:49.316 --> 54:51.466
They are your real relations.

54:51.666 --> 54:55.576
Then afterwards, when all these people will join -

54:55.776 --> 54:59.476
your father, mother, brothers, sisters, children,

54:59.676 --> 55:02.716
all of them will jump in. They are that type.

55:02.916 --> 55:07.116
They will wait and wait and wait. They are not seekers.

55:07.316 --> 55:11.056
But those who are seekers, you should seek them.

55:11.256 --> 55:13.966
You should find out where are they.

55:14.166 --> 55:16.876
My attention is, of course, is with you

55:17.076 --> 55:21.856
and every time you think of Me I'll be at your service fully.

55:22.066 --> 55:23.466
Whatever you want,

55:23.666 --> 55:28.156
I will be there to help you whichever way is possible.

55:28.356 --> 55:33.716
Anything you find very difficult, it's not.

55:33.926 --> 55:36.936
Because you take it upon yourself.

55:37.136 --> 55:42.676
But if you leave it to this All Pervading Power of Divine Love,

55:42.876 --> 55:50.036
to this power of Adi Shakti, Paramchaitanya, nothing is difficult,

55:50.246 --> 55:56.806
nothing is so bad that you cannot manage.

55:57.526 --> 56:00.756
I don't know if I have to talk about this Adi Shakti

56:00.956 --> 56:04.796
it will take at least ten hours minimum.

56:04.996 --> 56:08.986
So, I think I'd better stop now and we should keep something

56:09.196 --> 56:12.236
for the next Adi Shakti Puja. Somebody asked me,

56:12.446 --> 56:14.636
"Is it necessary to have this puja?"

56:14.836 --> 56:17.836
I think if there's any puja that you should do, is this one,

56:18.036 --> 56:19.526
is Adi Shakti.

56:19.726 --> 56:23.026
It's very important that this puja must be performed

56:23.226 --> 56:29.296
because that is how you grow, this reflection improves

56:29.496 --> 56:32.456
and you grow more and more within yourself

56:32.656 --> 56:37.386
through the power of Adi Shakti or through the power of Kundalini.

56:37.586 --> 56:42.386
As you know that Adi Shakti has Her own Kundalini

56:42.586 --> 56:45.066
which is the Adi Kundalini and the reflection of that

56:45.266 --> 56:49.096
within you is the Kundalini.

56:49.296 --> 56:50.546
So, you have to worship.

56:50.746 --> 56:54.906
And is the best way to please your own Kundalini,

56:55.106 --> 56:58.476
your own Mother who has given you this birth.

56:58.676 --> 57:02.176
May God bless you.
