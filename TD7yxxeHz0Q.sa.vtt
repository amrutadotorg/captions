Tad Nishkala
by Shrī Ādi Shaṅkarāchārya

00:12.265 --> 00:19.392
There’s a beautiful saying of Adi
Shankaracharya, Tad Nishkala,

00:21.554 --> 00:25.702
about Brahma Tattwa. I’m that
Brahma.

00:25.903 --> 00:29.492
On that. If you have? Let Me see.

00:29.693 --> 00:34.585
That’s the best way to understand
what you are.

00:36.965 --> 00:41.265
Just bring it. It’s very famous.
Have you got it?

00:41.426 --> 00:45.874
Yogi: Dakshina Murti?
Shri Mataji: No, not that, another one.

00:48.535 --> 00:52.382
Just bring it. Have you got the book?
Yogi: Can you bring the book to Shri Mataji?

00:59.364 --> 01:02.054
This is the one.

01:04.605 --> 01:06.695
Nirvana Shatakam. This one is the one.

01:06.880 --> 01:12.358
You just read it in English language.
I don't need it.

01:15.687 --> 01:22.140
When you have got your Nirvana,
what happens to you – it says that.

01:25.413 --> 01:29.421
Tad Nishkala is also known
as the Atma or Nirvana Shatakam –

01:29.622 --> 01:35.734
six verses on the theme of spiritual
liberation.

01:37.135 --> 01:50.119
Mano’buddhi ahaṅkār
chittāni n’āham

01:50.370 --> 02:04.219
Na cha shrotra jihve
na cha ghrāna netre

02:04.420 --> 02:16.150
Na cha vyoma bhūmir
na tejo na vāyuhu

02:16.351 --> 02:44.276
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

02:44.494 --> 02:56.190
Na cha prāna saoṅdñyao
na vai pancha-vāyur

02:56.391 --> 03:07.840
Na vā sapta-dhātur
na vā pancha-koshah

03:08.041 --> 03:18.737
Na vāk pāni-pādau
na ch’opasthapāyū

03:18.938 --> 03:45.643
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

03:45.867 --> 03:57.244
Na me dvesha-rāgau
na me lobha-mohau

03:57.445 --> 04:09.433
Mado n’aeva me n’aeva
mātsarya-bhāvah

04:09.634 --> 04:20.054
Na dharmo na ch’ārtho
na kāmo na mokshah

04:20.255 --> 04:45.288
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

04:45.520 --> 04:55.866
Na punyam na pāpam
na saukhyam na duhkham

04:56.067 --> 05:06.452
Na mantro na tīrtham
na vedā na yadñyāhā

05:06.653 --> 05:16.511
Aham bhojanam n’aeva
bhojyam na bhoktā

05:16.712 --> 05:41.374
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

05:41.575 --> 05:51.943
Na me mṛutyu shaṅkā
na me jāti bhedah

05:52.144 --> 06:03.546
Pitā n’aeva me n’aeva
mātā, na janma

06:03.747 --> 06:14.300
Na bandhur na mitram
gurūr n’aeva shishyah

06:14.501 --> 06:40.443
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

06:40.792 --> 06:50.451
Aham nirvikalpo
nirākāra rūpo

06:50.652 --> 07:01.527
Vibhur-vyāpya sarvatra
sarv’endriyāni

07:01.728 --> 07:12.490
Sadā me samatvam
na muktir na bandhah

07:12.691 --> 07:35.735
Chid’ānanda rūpah
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

07:35.952 --> 07:49.235
Shiv’oham Shiv’oham (x 2)

07:52.014 --> 07:56.544
That’s what you are. You are eternal
bliss and awareness.

07:56.745 --> 08:01.528
The consciousness, the pure consciousness.

08:03.404 --> 08:06.552
I think, this must be – everybody must
remember by heart.

08:06.753 --> 08:09.427
And must say in all the ashrams.

08:09.628 --> 08:14.021
That’s a very good way of remembering
what you are.

08:14.222 --> 08:17.091
May God bless you.
