00:08:00.417 --> 00:08:03.999
Today we have gathered here

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:06.625
to worship Shri Ganesha.

00:08:08.625 --> 00:08:13.542
Shri Ganesha is the Deity of innocence.

00:08:19.417 --> 00:08:21.834
When we are born as children,

00:08:24.041 --> 00:08:27.750
it is Shri Ganesha who is acting

00:08:28.750 --> 00:08:30.333
and we are very innocent,

00:08:33.875 --> 00:08:36.667
and it is such a powerful thing

00:08:37.542 --> 00:08:39.667
that, with this innocence,

00:08:41.250 --> 00:08:46.750
children survive under many circumstances.

00:08:53.542 --> 00:08:58.542
And we love them, because they are innocent.

00:08:59.875 --> 00:09:04.250
We enjoy them, because they are innocent.

00:09:08.333 --> 00:09:10.125
Once we start growing,

00:09:13.750 --> 00:09:16.667
our Sahastrara also gets closed

00:09:17.959 --> 00:09:22.667
and we develop all kinds of funny things

00:09:23.959 --> 00:09:28.250
that enters into us and doesn't go out.

00:09:30.125 --> 00:09:33.542
It's just there, it doesn't go out.

00:09:39.125 --> 00:09:44.041
Innocence has a great effect on our character

00:09:47.667 --> 00:09:51.959
and on our sense of chastity.

00:09:53.875 --> 00:09:55.333
Actually, when you are innocent,

00:09:55.542 --> 00:09:57.750
you don't know what is not chastity,

00:09:58.875 --> 00:10:04.542
what is being unchaste,

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:13.959
what is being cunning.

00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:19.125
You are innocent and you are looked after

00:10:19.458 --> 00:10:22.333
by Shri Ganesha Himself.

00:10:23.458 --> 00:10:27.250
Anybody who tries to harm a innocent person,

00:10:28.166 --> 00:10:32.875
Shri Ganesha looks after you and manages you.

00:10:36.792 --> 00:10:39.792
Many people who are innocent in this world

00:10:40.999 --> 00:10:42.583
- of course there are very few -

00:10:44.041 --> 00:10:48.166
but they become so detached

00:10:48.458 --> 00:10:53.875
from all worldly problems,

00:10:54.875 --> 00:10:59.166
like lust and greed, and many other.

00:11:00.166 --> 00:11:02.250
Because they are so pure

00:11:03.667 --> 00:11:08.250
that nothing can spoil them and malign them.

00:11:09.999 --> 00:11:13.792
This is such a great blessings we have,

00:11:15.458 --> 00:11:21.041
that innocence is actually created in us,

00:11:22.375 --> 00:11:24.458
and it was created much before,

00:11:26.375 --> 00:11:27.999
all the innocence,

00:11:28.875 --> 00:11:31.999
everything was created much, much before

00:11:34.041 --> 00:11:35.250
we were created.

00:11:37.041 --> 00:11:43.250
It's such a great quality for us to become innocent.

00:11:46.875 --> 00:11:53.166
The greatest quality of Shri Ganesha is joy.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:59.583
It gives you joy, as small children,

00:12:00.875 --> 00:12:02.375
they may not speak even,

00:12:02.667 --> 00:12:04.250
but they give us so much joy.

00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.375
Joy giving quality comes from Shri Ganesha.

00:12:10.709 --> 00:12:13.291
Even after coming to Sahaja Yoga I've seen people

00:12:14.709 --> 00:12:16.291
are not full of joy.

00:12:16.917 --> 00:12:20.375
Are very serious, they don't know how to laugh,

00:12:21.166 --> 00:12:22.999
how to enjoy anything.

00:12:23.999 --> 00:12:27.583
That's the sign that they are still lacking in innocence.

00:12:29.709 --> 00:12:33.083
So it's important to understand

00:12:34.375 --> 00:12:35.917
that, if you are sahaja yogis,

00:12:37.166 --> 00:12:42.166
you should be joyous and give joy to others,

00:12:42.917 --> 00:12:46.166
just like children, how sweet they are.

00:12:46.917 --> 00:12:48.583
They may be newly born,

00:12:49.083 --> 00:12:51.291
but how much joy they give you.

00:12:51.792 --> 00:12:57.291
But supposing you do not have that capacity

00:12:58.917 --> 00:13:01.792
to enjoy the innocence of children,

00:13:02.083 --> 00:13:04.375
then nobody can help you.

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.709
Ganesha cannot help you.

00:13:06.999 --> 00:13:11.999
Because that's the innate quality human beings have

00:13:12.792 --> 00:13:17.999
and if you don't have that quality,

00:13:18.709 --> 00:13:22.583
no use having any other sense.

00:13:23.291 --> 00:13:26.375
Like some people like food, they like colours,

00:13:26.583 --> 00:13:28.834
they like all other things.

00:13:29.417 --> 00:13:31.834
But if you don't have Shri Ganesh

00:13:32.083 --> 00:13:34.625
you cannot purely enjoy anything.

00:13:35.291 --> 00:13:38.083
So it is only Shri Ganesha's blessings

00:13:38.417 --> 00:13:43.208
that we really enjoy everything in its full measure.

00:13:43.999 --> 00:13:47.834
Otherwise, we start judging it,

00:13:49.625 --> 00:13:51.999
we start criticizing it,

00:13:52.999 --> 00:13:55.709
people raise so many things, questions.

00:13:56.917 --> 00:14:00.291
If you see something and it gives you joy,

00:14:00.917 --> 00:14:05.083
then you are supposed to give the explanation for that.

00:14:05.917 --> 00:14:09.208
As we have many critics in this world,

00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:14.500
and they are all the time criticizing one another.

00:14:15.834 --> 00:14:18.709
Now the critics are criticizing critics,

00:14:18.917 --> 00:14:20.083
that's the biggest problem.

00:14:20.417 --> 00:14:21.709
That's their job.

00:14:22.417 --> 00:14:25.500
Because Ganesha is not there.

00:14:26.291 --> 00:14:29.208
And they go on criticizing others,

00:14:29.834 --> 00:14:31.999
never criticizing themselves,

00:14:32.291 --> 00:14:34.625
and thinking no end of themselves.

00:14:35.083 --> 00:14:40.625
And with that, they create a very bad kind of a community,

00:14:41.333 --> 00:14:45.917
which is actually very harmful, it's very dangerous.

00:14:46.208 --> 00:14:51.834
It's like having some sort of a boil,

00:14:52.750 --> 00:14:58.333
or some sort of a septic thing in your body, in your being.

00:14:58.625 --> 00:15:02.208
So, if you cannot appreciate it,

00:15:02.333 --> 00:15:05.125
and if you cannot enjoy it,

00:15:05.417 --> 00:15:09.333
then Shri Ganesha is missing from you.

00:15:09.625 --> 00:15:13.542
You should be able to enjoy everything,

00:15:15.625 --> 00:15:20.417
and to enjoy your children, enjoy children of other people.

00:15:20.959 --> 00:15:28.750
That's the sign of your being completely blessed by Shri Ganesh.

00:15:30.542 --> 00:15:33.750
Now the beauty of Shri Ganesha is this,

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.125
that it looks after your Kundalini.

00:15:37.417 --> 00:15:39.834
It guards your Kundalini.

00:15:40.125 --> 00:15:42.000
It guides your Kundalini.

00:15:42.333 --> 00:15:47.750
And throughout on all the chakras he had to bless you.

00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:52.542
If you don't have the blessings of Shri Ganesh,

00:15:52.834 --> 00:15:56.750
you'll be completely useless fellow as a sahaja yogi,

00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.417
because all the time you are seeing the bad points of others,

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.333
all the time you are devoiding,

00:16:04.625 --> 00:16:09.417
I should say, you are getting into a problem,

00:16:11.208 --> 00:16:14.750
by which you cannot enjoy anything.

00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.667
By temperament you think you are very serious,

00:16:19.959 --> 00:16:23.750
you are very mature, you are very developed,

00:16:24.041 --> 00:16:25.750
but you are not innocent.

00:16:26.542 --> 00:16:30.250
Such a person gives such a headache to everyone.

00:16:30.542 --> 00:16:32.250
You know, if there's one like that,

00:16:32.542 --> 00:16:35.041
in the family, people want to get rid of him.

00:16:35.333 --> 00:16:40.959
So you should have the quality of Shri Ganesha

00:16:41.250 --> 00:16:46.125
which is of giving joy to others.

00:16:46.458 --> 00:16:50.542
Depends on how much joy you can give it to others.

00:16:50.875 --> 00:16:53.333
It doesn't want anything.

00:16:53.667 --> 00:16:57.667
Such a person won't say that "I must get this,

00:16:57.959 --> 00:16:59.875
I must have this position,

00:17:00.125 --> 00:17:03.750
I should be leader, I should be this and that", no.

00:17:04.542 --> 00:17:09.041
He just enjoys giving joy, joy to others,

00:17:09.333 --> 00:17:12.875
and being humorous, and kind,

00:17:13.125 --> 00:17:18.125
and never, never tries to insult anyone and hurt anyone.

00:17:18.458 --> 00:17:23.125
If such a person hurts, by mistake also,

00:17:23.458 --> 00:17:25.250
he goes on repenting about it.

00:17:25.542 --> 00:17:30.333
And hundred times he'll beg your pardon if he has hurt you.

00:17:30.667 --> 00:17:33.750
Such a happy person is a real sahaja yogi.

00:17:34.041 --> 00:17:37.875
That's the one we want to have all around.

00:17:38.166 --> 00:17:40.875
Those who have no hatred for anyone,

00:17:41.166 --> 00:17:43.250
no malice for anyone,

00:17:43.583 --> 00:17:45.667
and not finding faults with another,

00:17:45.999 --> 00:17:49.375
but trying to find what is the good point of that person,

00:17:49.667 --> 00:17:52.583
what is so special about that person.

00:17:52.875 --> 00:17:55.999
He's not bothered as to what colour you are,

00:17:56.250 --> 00:17:58.166
whether you are black or white,

00:17:58.458 --> 00:18:01.583
whether you are tall or short, it makes no difference.

00:18:01.875 --> 00:18:06.667
Because it is absolute. Absolute joy.

00:18:06.999 --> 00:18:10.667
And for this absolute joy, you don't criticize,

00:18:10.999 --> 00:18:17.583
and you don't try to find faults with others.

00:18:19.583 --> 00:18:21.458
Now, the problem is

00:18:21.792 --> 00:18:25.999
that people are getting very much advanced in this modern era,

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:29.875
very advanced, and they are very much more advanced

00:18:30.166 --> 00:18:32.375
in criticizing others, I think.

00:18:32.667 --> 00:18:35.875
That's the maxim they have, is to criticize others.

00:18:36.166 --> 00:18:40.458
And, also, they have another very bad quality,

00:18:40.792 --> 00:18:44.999
to identify themselves with the country in which they live

00:18:45.250 --> 00:18:47.250
or with the family they are with.

00:18:47.583 --> 00:18:49.583
I have seen it creates such a problem.

00:18:50.166 --> 00:18:53.083
Also they identify themselves

00:18:53.291 --> 00:18:55.375
with the different religions they follow.

00:18:55.709 --> 00:18:59.291
Imagine, from this, how many problems have come out

00:18:59.583 --> 00:19:04.500
- that you start differentiating between one and another.

00:19:04.792 --> 00:19:08.291
For example, now supposing who is born say,

00:19:08.583 --> 00:19:12.917
in one place, so he says he's the best,

00:19:13.166 --> 00:19:15.500
his country is the best,

00:19:15.792 --> 00:19:17.500
his people are the best,

00:19:17.792 --> 00:19:20.083
and there's nothing wrong with them.

00:19:20.375 --> 00:19:26.583
On the contrary, if a person is a real sahaja yogi,

00:19:26.917 --> 00:19:30.291
who has Ganesha within him, enlightened,

00:19:30.583 --> 00:19:34.375
then he sees it and enjoys the humour behind it.

00:19:34.709 --> 00:19:37.709
The humour of all these people,

00:19:37.999 --> 00:19:40.999
what they are mad after, how they behave.

00:19:41.291 --> 00:19:45.583
I mean the way he understands the jokes behind it,

00:19:45.917 --> 00:19:48.709
jokes which is avoiding reality.

00:19:48.999 --> 00:19:51.709
And reality is only possible

00:19:51.999 --> 00:19:54.500
if you are in the realm of joy.

00:19:54.792 --> 00:19:59.500
Otherwise, all the time you find something

00:19:59.709 --> 00:20:02.083
wrong, something upsetting,

00:20:02.417 --> 00:20:03.999
so something disturbs you.

00:20:04.291 --> 00:20:10.917
But if you see the humour behind everything

00:20:11.208 --> 00:20:13.834
then you are perfectly alright.

00:20:15.834 --> 00:20:18.208
For example, I would say,

00:20:18.208 --> 00:20:21.625
that I have had many such experiences,

00:20:21.917 --> 00:20:24.709
that people have told me

00:20:24.999 --> 00:20:26.999
"Mother, such and such fellow is like that,

00:20:27.208 --> 00:20:28.208
such and such fellow is like that."

00:20:29.083 --> 00:20:33.417
So, I would ask that person:

00:20:33.709 --> 00:20:36.834
"Are you like that?" Direct.

00:20:37.083 --> 00:20:39.834
He said "No, I'm not like that".

00:20:40.083 --> 00:20:42.709
"But, I said, why everybody sees that in you?"

00:20:43.417 --> 00:20:45.083
"Must be wrong!"

00:20:45.417 --> 00:20:47.999
"All of them must be wrong or you are wrong?"

00:20:48.291 --> 00:20:51.208
Then he would say, "Maybe, myself."

00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:52.709
And that's how you see,

00:20:52.999 --> 00:20:55.917
you can mould also such people, who think

00:20:56.208 --> 00:20:59.625
that they are correct and the rest of the world is all bad,

00:20:59.917 --> 00:21:02.208
and they have every right to hate them

00:21:02.500 --> 00:21:05.709
and to think in the wrong direction.

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.333
What happens with that is that you lose the essence of joy.

00:21:13.542 --> 00:21:16.625
Essence of joy is in seeing in everything,

00:21:16.959 --> 00:21:20.333
seeing in everything the source of joy.

00:21:21.542 --> 00:21:24.125
Supposing you see something here,

00:21:24.417 --> 00:21:27.959
now, if it is odd, it should give you

00:21:28.125 --> 00:21:30.333
also a great sense of humour.

00:21:30.625 --> 00:21:33.834
If it is beautiful, it should give you another

00:21:34.125 --> 00:21:35.417
sense, of appreciation.

00:21:35.750 --> 00:21:39.125
But I can't understand people who go on harping

00:21:39.417 --> 00:21:42.542
on some sort of a thing,

00:21:42.834 --> 00:21:44.959
that has no meaning in their lives

00:21:45.208 --> 00:21:47.208
nor in the lives of others.

00:21:49.333 --> 00:21:53.750
I would say my father had a great capacity to do that.

00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:59.000
Once, I went home, so I said this…

00:21:59.333 --> 00:22:02.625
"My brother was praising this man for his music,

00:22:02.834 --> 00:22:04.125
What do you think? His Friend"

00:22:04.417 --> 00:22:07.542
He said, "He is a musician, no doubt,

00:22:07.834 --> 00:22:09.959
but he is very courageous".

00:22:10.208 --> 00:22:11.208
I said: "Why?"

00:22:11.542 --> 00:22:14.333
"Because he may go on singing anything,

00:22:14.667 --> 00:22:18.333
he never feels bad about it. Everybody might be nervous,

00:22:18.667 --> 00:22:21.333
or everybody might be laughing at it,

00:22:21.667 --> 00:22:24.667
but he is not at all bothered.

00:22:24.959 --> 00:22:26.875
He goes on singing is his own ways."

00:22:27.125 --> 00:22:31.250
So, that is the beauty of understanding [that]

00:22:31.542 --> 00:22:34.750
every defect in a person can be enjoyed.

00:22:35.041 --> 00:22:40.542
Is very much a sense, I should say,

00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:45.959
a very subtle sense, by which you can enjoy every person.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:50.333
If he has defects, then you enjoy them as [a] humorous thing,

00:22:50.667 --> 00:22:53.458
and if he has something very good,

00:22:53.750 --> 00:22:55.125
then also you can enjoy.

00:22:55.458 --> 00:22:57.542
So why do you shun people?

00:22:57.875 --> 00:22:59.959
Why should you get out of people,

00:23:00.250 --> 00:23:01.959
criticize them for nothing at all?

00:23:02.125 --> 00:23:07.542
Now, under this, people have built up big organisations, you see.

00:23:07.875 --> 00:23:12.333
For examples, the Catholics will help (hate) the Protestants,

00:23:12.667 --> 00:23:15.667
the Protestants will help (hate),

00:23:15.959 --> 00:23:20.041
I mean not "help" I'm saying, they will also, sort of,

00:23:20.041 --> 00:23:24.041
hate the people who are Catholic.

00:23:24.333 --> 00:23:26.250
What's the use of that?

00:23:26.583 --> 00:23:30.166
What's the use of hating each other,

00:23:30.375 --> 00:23:33.250
from that point, that somebody is a Protestant

00:23:33.583 --> 00:23:35.375
and somebody is a Catholic?

00:23:35.667 --> 00:23:37.792
Just see yourself.

00:23:38.041 --> 00:23:39.999
See what is wrong with you!

00:23:40.250 --> 00:23:41.999
Why do you think like that?

00:23:42.250 --> 00:23:43.999
Why do you look at those things

00:23:44.250 --> 00:23:47.250
and always think that another person,

00:23:47.458 --> 00:23:49.166
something wrong with him.

00:23:49.375 --> 00:23:52.583
And then you form groups and then you fight,

00:23:52.875 --> 00:23:56.166
you can have even wars with this kind of an idea

00:23:56.458 --> 00:23:59.041
that the another person is not all right

00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:01.792
and you are absolutely perfect.

00:24:02.041 --> 00:24:04.375
This is also with the country, I have seen.

00:24:04.667 --> 00:24:07.250
For example, even in Sahaja Yoga I have seen

00:24:07.583 --> 00:24:10.375
if somebody is coming, say, from India

00:24:10.667 --> 00:24:13.166
or from another country anywhere,

00:24:13.458 --> 00:24:18.250
the leader will be anxious that he should or she should

00:24:18.583 --> 00:24:20.792
put her  candidate before Me.

00:24:21.583 --> 00:24:24.166
It's such an identification,

00:24:24.375 --> 00:24:27.583
which they are not still conscious of it.

00:24:27.875 --> 00:24:30.250
But then I play my tricks you see.

00:24:30.583 --> 00:24:32.500
All such thing when they do,

00:24:32.792 --> 00:24:36.500
when they try to support one party,

00:24:36.792 --> 00:24:39.083
one type of people, from one reli…,

00:24:39.375 --> 00:24:42.291
we should say not 'religion' now, but the countries.

00:24:42.583 --> 00:24:47.291
So, this country identification is so much still in Sahaja Yoga,

00:24:47.583 --> 00:24:49.917
that, you come from one country,

00:24:50.166 --> 00:24:53.375
then you want to support that man from that country.

00:24:54.083 --> 00:24:59.917
You'll never appreciate that whosoever is good,

00:25:00.166 --> 00:25:03.583
coming from any country, is a Sahaja Yogi.

00:25:04.709 --> 00:25:06.583
We are a global community,

00:25:06.917 --> 00:25:10.917
we are not to be identified with one country

00:25:11.166 --> 00:25:13.166
- that our people should be married,

00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:15.583
that we should get our people there.

00:25:15.917 --> 00:25:18.166
All this kind of thing I have noticed,

00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:20.083
and I feel very sorry

00:25:20.375 --> 00:25:23.792
that you have not understood the nature of Sahaja Yoga.

00:25:24.083 --> 00:25:29.083
Sahaja Yoga is a global thing. Absolutely global.

00:25:29.375 --> 00:25:33.917
It has nothing to do with one country or with one person.

00:25:34.166 --> 00:25:39.166
It's such a global thing that if you see the subtle side of it,

00:25:39.291 --> 00:25:41.709
it's very joy-giving.

00:25:43.083 --> 00:25:46.083
God Almighty has created this world as one.

00:25:46.417 --> 00:25:48.500
They might have United Nations,

00:25:48.709 --> 00:25:50.291
they might have this, they might have that,

00:25:50.625 --> 00:25:53.917
but still they are so much identified with their country

00:25:55.834 --> 00:25:58.417
that they cannot correct also that country.

00:25:58.709 --> 00:25:59.625
Now, for example,

00:25:59.917 --> 00:26:02.917
something is wrong with your country, they cannot.

00:26:03.834 --> 00:26:06.291
For them, everything is all right, first,

00:26:06.625 --> 00:26:08.999
because they are born in that particular country.

00:26:09.291 --> 00:26:11.500
Or they appreciate some other country,

00:26:11.834 --> 00:26:13.834
so they'll go on praising that country,

00:26:14.083 --> 00:26:17.208
to such an extent that they are destroyed

00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.083
and their ideas also destroy people.

00:26:20.917 --> 00:26:26.208
So best thing is to see the joke behind being

00:26:27.500 --> 00:26:29.709
identified with one country.

00:26:29.999 --> 00:26:31.917
There's a big joke about it.

00:26:32.208 --> 00:26:35.208
I enjoy it very much. Among sahaja yogis also I've seen,

00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:39.083
it's very common that they are identified with one country.

00:26:39.417 --> 00:26:41.500
If you are identified,

00:26:41.709 --> 00:26:44.291
then you should try to correct that country.

00:26:44.625 --> 00:26:46.834
You should try to correct those countrymen

00:26:47.125 --> 00:26:51.125
who are following a particular type of ideologies.

00:26:51.417 --> 00:26:52.959
They never see that,

00:26:53.208 --> 00:26:57.125
because they are so much involved with them,

00:26:57.417 --> 00:26:59.542
that they don't see what's wrong with them.

00:26:59.834 --> 00:27:01.959
They'll always see what's wrong with others.

00:27:02.208 --> 00:27:06.125
But I've seen those who are real sahaja yogis are very good.

00:27:06.834 --> 00:27:09.625
They tell me what's wrong in their own country.

00:27:09.959 --> 00:27:12.333
What's going wrong in their own country.

00:27:12.625 --> 00:27:14.834
What's the trouble in their own country.

00:27:15.125 --> 00:27:19.959
How the countrymen are. You see, very surprising!

00:27:20.208 --> 00:27:23.125
I was surprised how people told me

00:27:23.417 --> 00:27:28.417
that how some people who are in their country

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:30.959
are so misidentified,

00:27:31.208 --> 00:27:35.333
and they are so against Sahaja Yoga in a subtle manner.

00:27:35.625 --> 00:27:38.959
I was surprised, how they felt it that way.

00:27:39.208 --> 00:27:42.000
They said, "Mother, see, they are not at all global."

00:27:42.333 --> 00:27:47.208
Once you become global, all your problems of provinces

00:27:47.542 --> 00:27:48.959
and things are finished.

00:27:49.208 --> 00:27:51.000
But that doesn't come into their head,

00:27:51.333 --> 00:27:53.000
that we have to be global.

00:27:53.333 --> 00:27:54.542
We are sahaja yogis,

00:27:54.875 --> 00:27:56.959
we cannot identify ourselves

00:27:57.250 --> 00:27:59.458
with one country or another country.

00:27:59.750 --> 00:28:02.959
If we do that, then we are still lacking

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.875
in our universal personality.

00:28:07.125 --> 00:28:12.250
And this universal personality comes to us from Shri Ganesh.

00:28:12.875 --> 00:28:15.125
He's a universal personality,

00:28:15.458 --> 00:28:21.875
whether He is in India, whether He is in Italy or in England.

00:28:22.542 --> 00:28:26.041
What is that personality? Is innocence.

00:28:26.959 --> 00:28:33.667
Very innocence, very much innocent, and not only that,

00:28:33.959 --> 00:28:37.041
but he is a joy giving personality.

00:28:37.333 --> 00:28:42.125
All such people, who are joy giving, are recognized.

00:28:42.458 --> 00:28:45.125
It's not that the world doesn't recognize.

00:28:45.458 --> 00:28:48.041
They may not be knowing that they are global,

00:28:48.333 --> 00:28:50.250
but those who are global people,

00:28:50.542 --> 00:28:54.333
they write books on global ways,

00:28:54.667 --> 00:28:56.750
thinking about global things.

00:28:57.041 --> 00:29:00.458
And they can criticize also people of their own country,

00:29:00.750 --> 00:29:03.333
they can criticize people of their own clan,

00:29:03.667 --> 00:29:05.333
they can go on like that.

00:29:05.667 --> 00:29:09.166
But they can be slavish also to some other country

00:29:09.458 --> 00:29:11.375
and try to praise them too much.

00:29:11.667 --> 00:29:13.875
So, you are not to be slavish.

00:29:15.166 --> 00:29:17.667
You have to not to be identified.

00:29:17.999 --> 00:29:20.667
But you should be identified with your Self.

00:29:21.458 --> 00:29:25.166
And whatever your Self enjoys, that should be expressed.

00:29:25.458 --> 00:29:28.583
That is the sign that your Ganesha is there

00:29:28.875 --> 00:29:30.667
and that Ganesha's working out.

00:29:30.999 --> 00:29:33.875
It's very important for leaders to understand this.

00:29:34.166 --> 00:29:36.792
Because I've seen the way they are identified

00:29:37.667 --> 00:29:40.375
with their countrymen is sometimes shocking to Me.

00:29:40.667 --> 00:29:43.166
I'm really shocked, how could they be.

00:29:43.458 --> 00:29:45.583
They are not belonging to any country.

00:29:45.875 --> 00:29:49.583
They are no more. They are in the country of Shri Ganesha,

00:29:49.875 --> 00:29:52.458
which is the country of Love and Joy.

00:29:52.792 --> 00:29:55.583
If you cannot give joy and love,

00:29:55.875 --> 00:29:57.250
then there's something wrong with you.

00:29:58.667 --> 00:30:02.792
With this only, his quality, people become chaste.

00:30:03.375 --> 00:30:08.166
Because chastity is a very joy giving thing, very joy giving.

00:30:09.166 --> 00:30:12.083
It is not a thing that you have to tell somebody,

00:30:12.375 --> 00:30:15.291
or to force somebody, or to restrict somebody,

00:30:15.583 --> 00:30:19.583
but it is to enjoy it.

00:30:20.583 --> 00:30:24.500
To enjoy yourself and enjoy the chastity of another person.

00:30:24.792 --> 00:30:29.709
Is such a great blessing of Shri Ganesha,

00:30:30.583 --> 00:30:35.291
such a great blessing that you enjoy your own chastity.

00:30:35.583 --> 00:30:38.083
You are not bothered about the another person

00:30:38.375 --> 00:30:42.709
he's chaste or not, if he's doing bad things,

00:30:42.999 --> 00:30:44.917
if he's a ruined person, doesn't matter.

00:30:45.166 --> 00:30:47.291
You don't get spoilt with that.

00:30:47.500 --> 00:30:50.500
You have your own chastity,

00:30:50.792 --> 00:30:55.583
your own life of very chaste moments.

00:30:57.709 --> 00:31:01.917
It is nowadays such a modern style of

00:31:02.166 --> 00:31:04.375
thinking there's a flowing towards

00:31:04.709 --> 00:31:10.375
unchaste life and all kinds of wrong ideas about chastity.

00:31:10.709 --> 00:31:13.083
If somebody now talks of chastity,

00:31:13.375 --> 00:31:16.917
people think that this must be mad, how can that be?

00:31:17.166 --> 00:31:19.792
Everything is done these days, if you see,

00:31:20.083 --> 00:31:21.917
all the fashions are there.

00:31:22.166 --> 00:31:25.500
Now, once the fashion starts, it goes on spreading.

00:31:26.083 --> 00:31:28.709
Then, everybody will dress up in the same manner.

00:31:28.917 --> 00:31:30.709
They have no personality of their own.

00:31:30.999 --> 00:31:34.208
Everybody will be going round in the same manner,

00:31:34.500 --> 00:31:38.417
especially the women have lost their sense of chastity.

00:31:38.709 --> 00:31:40.999
They have lost their sense of chastity,

00:31:41.291 --> 00:31:44.083
because the way they dress up sometimes, shocks Me.

00:31:44.417 --> 00:31:46.709
What is the need to dress up like this?

00:31:46.999 --> 00:31:48.834
Why can't you dress up properly?

00:31:49.083 --> 00:31:52.208
But it is just, just…

00:31:53.291 --> 00:31:56.083
shows that they have no character of their own.

00:31:56.417 --> 00:31:59.291
Actually, they may say "I am this, I am that",

00:31:59.625 --> 00:32:00.999
but they are not, they are nothing.

00:32:01.291 --> 00:32:05.709
Because they take to all kinds of forces that run around.

00:32:06.834 --> 00:32:07.999
But look at the children.

00:32:08.291 --> 00:32:10.083
Children are not like that.

00:32:10.417 --> 00:32:13.999
They do not have all these funny ideas

00:32:14.291 --> 00:32:17.208
of impressing people with their unchaste life.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:20.834
None of them. On the contrary, children are very conscious

00:32:21.083 --> 00:32:24.208
and they want to become very chaste people.

00:32:26.291 --> 00:32:28.917
This has an effect on the eyes, I must say.

00:32:29.208 --> 00:32:31.417
Shri Ganesha acts through your eyes.

00:32:31.750 --> 00:32:34.542
How you look at a person is very important.

00:32:34.834 --> 00:32:38.625
I have seen people losing complete control over their eyes,

00:32:38.959 --> 00:32:41.625
they'll go on looking at this person, looking at another person,

00:32:41.959 --> 00:32:42.834
looking at another person,

00:32:43.417 --> 00:32:46.125
just for nothing at all, but it's a matter

00:32:46.417 --> 00:32:49.000
of no Ganesha control.

00:32:49.333 --> 00:32:51.834
And with this the eyes are spoilt.

00:32:52.125 --> 00:32:56.959
Spoilt means that you cannot look at anything concentratedly.

00:32:57.208 --> 00:32:59.959
Then, how can you penetrate into anything?

00:33:00.208 --> 00:33:05.000
Any penetration is possible only if you can really

00:33:06.417 --> 00:33:08.750
adjust your eyes in such a manner,

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.542
that you see something at that time for that time,

00:33:13.834 --> 00:33:17.333
and not go on shifting your eyes from one to another.

00:33:17.625 --> 00:33:21.000
It can mean anything, it can come from anything.

00:33:21.333 --> 00:33:27.834
That means Ganesha is the One who is a detector of our faults.

00:33:28.125 --> 00:33:30.750
For example, people have greed.

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:35.333
So they will start seeing who's wearing what clothes,

00:33:35.625 --> 00:33:37.625
what clothes they should wear.

00:33:37.959 --> 00:33:41.333
If they have greed, then they'll see somebody has a nice house,

00:33:41.667 --> 00:33:43.667
"I should also have a nice house."

00:33:43.959 --> 00:33:46.542
But they never see the beauty of that house.

00:33:46.875 --> 00:33:51.750
They never see the actual essence of that house.

00:33:52.041 --> 00:33:54.750
But, just, they go on seeing that,

00:33:54.959 --> 00:33:56.750
"I should have this house, this kind,

00:33:56.959 --> 00:33:58.041
I should have that."

00:33:58.333 --> 00:34:00.333
They have no sense of beauty, I should say,

00:34:00.667 --> 00:34:02.542
they have only sense of possession.

00:34:02.875 --> 00:34:06.458
And that is such a bad thing to say,

00:34:06.667 --> 00:34:10.667
because sense of beauty is something so deep,

00:34:10.959 --> 00:34:16.125
and sense of possession is so grotesque, so aggressive.

00:34:16.458 --> 00:34:20.250
So, one should look at things from Ganesha's angle,

00:34:20.542 --> 00:34:23.125
how will He do it, how will He use it?

00:34:23.458 --> 00:34:26.542
You will learn from children, how they watch things,

00:34:26.875 --> 00:34:30.041
and how they work it out, how they think.

00:34:30.333 --> 00:34:32.959
You will be amazed, how sensible they are,

00:34:33.250 --> 00:34:35.333
and the, very sensible, things they talk.

00:34:35.667 --> 00:34:37.542
Like I met a child,

00:34:38.875 --> 00:34:42.125
so the child told me  "I love the moon."

00:34:42.458 --> 00:34:46.667
I said: "Alright. Now, what's wrong with the moon?"

00:34:46.875 --> 00:34:50.875
"Nothing, but it hides itself under the clouds all the time."

00:34:51.583 --> 00:34:54.458
So, I said "Why does he do that?"

00:34:54.792 --> 00:34:56.166
"Because he walks too much.

00:34:56.458 --> 00:34:59.583
So, he's tired and he has to rest alright.

00:34:59.875 --> 00:35:01.583
And that's why he does it.

00:35:01.875 --> 00:35:05.250
If he doesn't walk so much, if he keeps steady,

00:35:05.583 --> 00:35:07.166
he won't have to do it." Just imagine!

00:35:07.458 --> 00:35:10.667
A little child watching all these things!

00:35:10.999 --> 00:35:15.166
And, I mean, I was amazed how the little child

00:35:15.375 --> 00:35:17.999
knows what is right, what is wrong,

00:35:18.250 --> 00:35:19.792
what, how to behave,

00:35:19.875 --> 00:35:27.875
how to understand the proper way of doing things.

00:35:29.041 --> 00:35:30.792
They are not taught anything,

00:35:31.041 --> 00:35:32.375
they are not conditioned, nothing.

00:35:32.667 --> 00:35:34.875
But they know how to behave.

00:35:35.166 --> 00:35:38.875
And they are always looked after by the Divine.

00:35:39.792 --> 00:35:42.875
I have known children, who have fallen from great heights.

00:35:43.166 --> 00:35:44.792
Nothing happened to them!

00:35:46.041 --> 00:35:50.458
And also no snakes and all these things don't bite children.

00:35:51.458 --> 00:35:55.458
Even, they say, that tigers

00:35:55.667 --> 00:36:00.375
never try to eat children. What is it?

00:36:00.709 --> 00:36:02.500
What is so powerful about it,

00:36:02.792 --> 00:36:06.500
that children are so safe and allowed to grow?

00:36:06.792 --> 00:36:10.375
But then they grow into such horrible creatures

00:36:10.709 --> 00:36:14.083
who are unchaste,

00:36:15.375 --> 00:36:18.375
who are running after women or women running after men.

00:36:18.709 --> 00:36:20.375
Is a common play these days.

00:36:20.709 --> 00:36:23.375
And it is unbelievable how can

00:36:23.709 --> 00:36:26.500
people who are even sahaja yogis do this.

00:36:26.792 --> 00:36:28.166
Of course, they don't.

00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.792
But some of them they are still in this kind of a mess.

00:36:32.917 --> 00:36:36.166
So, when you have your Ganesha already established…

00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.375
Just before creating the whole Universe,

00:36:39.709 --> 00:36:42.709
the Mother created Shri Ganesha.

00:36:42.999 --> 00:36:46.583
If He's there, then life is very easy.

00:36:46.917 --> 00:36:49.583
Such a society is very easy to live.

00:36:49.917 --> 00:36:55.166
Such a friendship also is so easy.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:37:01.500
Because there's nothing that is possessiveness

00:37:01.583 --> 00:37:08.375
or any kind of a, you can call, perversity.

00:37:10.375 --> 00:37:13.500
When you have bad eyes for women,

00:37:13.834 --> 00:37:16.500
bad eyes for money,

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:21.999
bad eyes for possessions, Ganesha is spoilt.

00:37:23.709 --> 00:37:26.291
He just knows how to enjoy.

00:37:27.291 --> 00:37:28.500
Enjoy everything.

00:37:29.500 --> 00:37:31.625
If it belongs to you, doesn't matter.

00:37:31.917 --> 00:37:34.208
It belongs to me, it doesn't matter.

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.417
But you should know how to enjoy the beauty of it.

00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:45.709
And that enjoyment when you have within yourself,

00:37:45.999 --> 00:37:49.625
you don't grow old, because all the time you are enjoying!

00:37:49.917 --> 00:37:52.500
What is there to grow old?

00:37:52.834 --> 00:37:54.917
But normally, it doesn't happen.

00:37:55.208 --> 00:37:59.208
You are very critical, you are very,

00:37:59.500 --> 00:38:05.083
I should say, selfish, and stupid sometimes, very much stupid.

00:38:05.417 --> 00:38:12.500
all that you lose all that grip over your Self, which is joy.

00:38:13.834 --> 00:38:17.417
What is your Self? Self is nothing but joy!

00:38:17.709 --> 00:38:21.625
A joyous person is definitely a person

00:38:21.917 --> 00:38:26.625
who has got his Self expressing, through his joy.

00:38:26.917 --> 00:38:31.625
Such a person is so joy giving, so humorous.

00:38:32.208 --> 00:38:35.291
And never degrading anyone.

00:38:35.625 --> 00:38:38.999
In every small thing it sees a beauty.

00:38:39.333 --> 00:38:46.333
And nature of every creation is so beautiful.

00:38:46.625 --> 00:38:48.542
I'm really surprised,

00:38:48.834 --> 00:38:52.542
how is it that poetry comes to very few people…

00:38:52.834 --> 00:38:56.750
Because they go on describing love affairs, this, that,

00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:01.333
all nonsensical things, and what things make you unhappy.

00:39:01.625 --> 00:39:06.834
Unhappy is not the sign of a person who is a realised soul.

00:39:07.125 --> 00:39:10.750
So, if you have that problem of unhappiness

00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:12.333
just be on the watch out

00:39:12.542 --> 00:39:14.959
and see why, why have you developed

00:39:15.208 --> 00:39:19.000
this kind of a funny attitude towards everything.

00:39:19.333 --> 00:39:21.417
Why can't you enjoy everything?

00:39:21.750 --> 00:39:24.417
You go on watching this person, that person,

00:39:24.750 --> 00:39:25.959
you never enjoy.

00:39:26.208 --> 00:39:29.125
While if you watch the children, it's very interesting.

00:39:30.417 --> 00:39:33.750
They look at…Like I saw one joke.

00:39:34.000 --> 00:39:35.625
There was a joke about a child.

00:39:36.542 --> 00:39:39.125
They had a guest in their house for food,

00:39:39.417 --> 00:39:41.333
and he was eating.

00:39:43.125 --> 00:39:45.333
So this child saw that man eating.

00:39:45.625 --> 00:39:48.417
He said "Mama, he doesn't eat like a horse,

00:39:48.750 --> 00:39:50.417
you said he eats like a horse."

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:58.041
So, that's what they are, very simple, very simple-hearted,

00:39:58.333 --> 00:40:01.458
and that's how they correct people. Correct.

00:40:01.750 --> 00:40:03.458
What you should talk to children,

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:06.458
what you should tell them about is very important

00:40:06.750 --> 00:40:11.250
because if you tell them something "Don't do it!"

00:40:11.959 --> 00:40:14.250
So, they will do it in such a manner,

00:40:14.542 --> 00:40:18.250
that it will be ridiculous, absolutely ridiculous

00:40:18.542 --> 00:40:21.041
and they are so obedient, to begin with.

00:40:21.250 --> 00:40:23.875
They think that "We are children, we should obey."

00:40:24.125 --> 00:40:28.542
And this obedience comes out of their simple nature.

00:40:28.875 --> 00:40:31.959
But we should not try to tell them too many things,

00:40:32.875 --> 00:40:34.875
and we shouldn't like to control them

00:40:35.041 --> 00:40:38.542
with "Don't do this, don't do that!"

00:40:38.875 --> 00:40:40.875
All the time if you do it like that,

00:40:41.125 --> 00:40:42.458
the children won't understand.

00:40:42.667 --> 00:40:43.750
You don't have to tell them.

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.959
But if they are chaste children,

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:49.125
if they are brought up in a chaste society…

00:40:49.458 --> 00:40:52.667
That's why I always say "Baba, send your children to our school."

00:40:52.999 --> 00:40:55.667
Because children have to be chaste.

00:40:55.999 --> 00:40:58.792
They must understand the value of chastity.

00:40:59.041 --> 00:41:01.583
And these modern societies, in the Western

00:41:01.875 --> 00:41:06.792
area specially, are very destroying our children's innocence.

00:41:07.583 --> 00:41:10.375
We should have learned so much from the children,

00:41:10.667 --> 00:41:13.166
how innocent they are, how simple they are.

00:41:13.667 --> 00:41:15.667
They are very generous,

00:41:15.999 --> 00:41:19.375
and children will give away everything they have, everything.

00:41:19.667 --> 00:41:22.250
They don't understand possession of things.

00:41:22.583 --> 00:41:23.667
Just imagine.

00:41:24.166 --> 00:41:27.458
If somebody likes something, alright, have it.

00:41:27.792 --> 00:41:29.375
And they'll keep something

00:41:29.583 --> 00:41:31.875
for a person who likes something, you know.

00:41:32.166 --> 00:41:33.375
They are wonderful people.

00:41:33.667 --> 00:41:35.999
And we have to learn a lot from children.

00:41:36.999 --> 00:41:42.166
And their smiling faces and their joy

00:41:42.458 --> 00:41:44.583
should teach us how to behave.

00:41:44.875 --> 00:41:47.875
Because Ganesha shines through them very clearly.

00:41:48.583 --> 00:41:52.250
All the intelligence, all the beautiful things they say,

00:41:52.583 --> 00:41:54.667
I would say, you should all write it down

00:41:54.999 --> 00:41:56.583
- what your children talk, say.

00:41:56.917 --> 00:42:02.166
Because it would be such a book of interesting episodes,

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:04.583
instead of writing about wars

00:42:04.917 --> 00:42:09.083
and horrible things that they have done in this world,

00:42:09.375 --> 00:42:11.291
better write what good things there are,

00:42:11.583 --> 00:42:12.917
which children can tell you.

00:42:13.166 --> 00:42:17.375
Children don't believe in all this kind of a mass

00:42:17.709 --> 00:42:19.917
nonsense of a fashion. They don't.

00:42:20.166 --> 00:42:22.999
See, they are properly dressed always,

00:42:23.291 --> 00:42:27.917
they are not bothered about behaving in the mass way.

00:42:28.166 --> 00:42:30.917
So, that means they are very independent, on their own.

00:42:31.166 --> 00:42:33.917
They are not slaves of any society.

00:42:34.166 --> 00:42:36.083
And they do not want

00:42:36.291 --> 00:42:39.709
to follow anything that is just generally followed, no.

00:42:39.999 --> 00:42:42.291
They follow their own pattern,

00:42:42.583 --> 00:42:45.291
and live in very dignified manner.

00:42:45.583 --> 00:42:50.291
They are extremely dignified and their sense of chastity

00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.291
is very well developed.

00:42:52.583 --> 00:42:55.917
They would not wear something that will expose their body,

00:42:56.166 --> 00:42:59.500
or will show that there's something wrong with them.

00:42:59.834 --> 00:43:02.166
Sometimes we neglect our children very much.

00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:05.208
Because of money problems, maybe, or I don't know

00:43:05.417 --> 00:43:07.291
what husband-wife problems there are,

00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:09.208
and the children are neglected.

00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.083
And once they are neglected,

00:43:12.417 --> 00:43:16.083
anything can happen to them and I think it's a very great sin

00:43:16.291 --> 00:43:19.834
on the part of people to produce children and to neglect them.

00:43:20.083 --> 00:43:23.083
Children should be given the first,

00:43:23.417 --> 00:43:26.834
the primary place in the household, in the family.

00:43:27.083 --> 00:43:30.083
And they should be looked after by everyone.

00:43:30.417 --> 00:43:32.083
They are the most important thing,

00:43:32.417 --> 00:43:34.834
not somebody, he's the head of the family,

00:43:35.083 --> 00:43:37.999
he can shout at the children and…nothing of the kind!

00:43:39.709 --> 00:43:41.834
Moreover, I have seen that

00:43:42.917 --> 00:43:47.083
the way we take to all odd things and bad habits,

00:43:47.417 --> 00:43:48.625
children never take.

00:43:48.917 --> 00:43:51.999
They know that it is bad, it should not be done.

00:43:52.291 --> 00:43:54.999
By their innocence they know it should not be done.

00:43:55.291 --> 00:43:57.291
They may sometimes, you know,

00:43:57.625 --> 00:43:59.625
play with fire, do something like that.

00:43:59.917 --> 00:44:02.917
But once they are bitten by it they'll never touch it.

00:44:03.208 --> 00:44:06.542
They are extremely fast in learning,

00:44:06.834 --> 00:44:11.000
because that is the age they are, they're growing.

00:44:11.333 --> 00:44:15.542
But actually, what is needed now, is that the elders must grow.

00:44:15.834 --> 00:44:18.208
The children are growing, they learn.

00:44:18.542 --> 00:44:19.834
What about the elders?

00:44:20.125 --> 00:44:22.208
They have to learn also

00:44:22.542 --> 00:44:25.417
how to be nice and kind to everyone.

00:44:25.750 --> 00:44:29.208
And to be compassionate with all the rest of them.

00:44:29.542 --> 00:44:35.417
This idea of criticism comes from where? I don't know.

00:44:35.750 --> 00:44:38.959
But like they'll go anywhere, they'll start criticising.

00:44:39.208 --> 00:44:40.750
Children never criticize.

00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.834
They never see these things, never.

00:44:43.125 --> 00:44:48.834
They'll just get into that house, or any place,

00:44:49.125 --> 00:44:52.959
and just enjoy it and see the good points of that house.

00:44:53.208 --> 00:44:54.834
Always I have seen they'll come and tell

00:44:54.959 --> 00:44:58.417
"See, they had one very nice Shri Ganesha's this thing."

00:44:58.750 --> 00:45:01.625
The house may be dirty, there might be smell,

00:45:01.959 --> 00:45:03.625
anything, doesn't matter.

00:45:03.959 --> 00:45:09.000
See, so their eyes are towards nice things and good things.

00:45:09.333 --> 00:45:13.333
They don't , sort of, take to all these things.

00:45:13.667 --> 00:45:17.125
Then, also, because of modern life, children

00:45:17.458 --> 00:45:20.750
have developed a kind of a funny characters,

00:45:21.041 --> 00:45:24.458
when they grow up: "I don't like this, I don't like that",

00:45:24.750 --> 00:45:28.750
and they fall into funny, funny, I should say,

00:45:28.959 --> 00:45:33.250
ideas about life, which we must try to guard.

00:45:33.542 --> 00:45:38.250
Because these days the society is growing so fast.

00:45:38.542 --> 00:45:42.250
There are televisions, there are so many, I should say,

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.875
propagating things which are not good for children

00:45:51.125 --> 00:45:53.667
and they should not see them also.

00:45:53.959 --> 00:45:57.667
And if the children are realised souls, they don't like to see.

00:45:57.959 --> 00:46:00.041
They don't like to see violence.

00:46:00.333 --> 00:46:02.959
They don't like to see nonsense, I have seen it.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:04.959
They don't like.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:08.041
But the parents are sitting and enjoying nonsense,

00:46:08.333 --> 00:46:10.250
so they are also sitting. Gradually,

00:46:10.458 --> 00:46:12.041
it might crawl into their heads.

00:46:12.333 --> 00:46:15.458
But normally, children don't like any violence,

00:46:15.750 --> 00:46:17.458
and beating, any kind of thing.

00:46:17.750 --> 00:46:20.250
So, we have to learn a lot from them,

00:46:20.583 --> 00:46:22.166
because they are innocent,

00:46:22.375 --> 00:46:24.999
because they have the quality of innocence,

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:26.875
so they are to be respected.

00:46:27.166 --> 00:46:31.667
I don't like people beating their children or hitting them

00:46:31.999 --> 00:46:34.792
and fulfilling their ambitions through the children.

00:46:34.999 --> 00:46:36.166
It's very, very wrong.

00:46:36.458 --> 00:46:38.875
You should leave them alone, they are perfect.

00:46:39.166 --> 00:46:41.375
Only thing is they should be given

00:46:41.667 --> 00:46:45.041
proper ideas at a time, appreciation

00:46:45.375 --> 00:46:48.041
for their chastity, for their well behaviour.

00:46:48.375 --> 00:46:49.583
That should be done.

00:46:49.875 --> 00:46:53.166
But should not be given a kind of

00:46:53.458 --> 00:46:56.458
idea of the society in which they live.

00:46:56.792 --> 00:46:58.458
Where the children get spoilt.

00:46:58.792 --> 00:47:01.583
And I was surprised that I'd met one child,

00:47:01.875 --> 00:47:07.041
the other day, and the child said:  "I want to have a car."

00:47:08.375 --> 00:47:10.667
"Which car?" "Mercedes."

00:47:10.999 --> 00:47:13.166
I said: "Why don't you go for a Ferrari?"

00:47:15.792 --> 00:47:18.041
So you see, this money orientation also

00:47:18.375 --> 00:47:19.583
comes from childhood.

00:47:20.583 --> 00:47:24.500
From childhood if you talk of all these things, money orientation,

00:47:24.792 --> 00:47:27.375
children also know this and they talk like that.

00:47:27.709 --> 00:47:29.500
There are many other things for children,

00:47:29.792 --> 00:47:31.083
we should just avoid.

00:47:31.375 --> 00:47:34.166
Don't allow them to go near all such things,

00:47:34.500 --> 00:47:37.500
which are creating money orientation

00:47:37.792 --> 00:47:39.917
because that is the problem of today,

00:47:40.166 --> 00:47:44.709
that everywhere you find people who have made money, illegally.

00:47:44.917 --> 00:47:46.166
So much money has been made.

00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:48.500
And there is no need to do that.

00:47:48.792 --> 00:47:52.166
But still, you see, they go, this money orientation is funny thing.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.999
It's a greed, it's a madness, I tell you, real madness.

00:47:56.291 --> 00:47:59.083
A person wants to have, say, 25 cars.

00:47:59.375 --> 00:48:01.500
Is he going to sit in the 25 cars?

00:48:01.792 --> 00:48:04.917
He wants to have 25 aeroplanes.

00:48:05.083 --> 00:48:06.166
What is he going to do with that?

00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:08.709
For that, he is cheating everyone,

00:48:08.999 --> 00:48:11.709
troubling everyone, taking the money of others.

00:48:11.999 --> 00:48:14.583
Is better to be poor, than to be like that.

00:48:14.917 --> 00:48:17.166
So, this is what is happening today

00:48:17.500 --> 00:48:21.417
is that people have gone…the track is wrong.

00:48:21.709 --> 00:48:24.917
Is the right side track, right side track.

00:48:25.208 --> 00:48:29.083
I should say, we start our Sahaja Yoga from Shri Ganesha,

00:48:29.417 --> 00:48:32.083
who is on the left side. Not on the right side.

00:48:32.291 --> 00:48:34.709
First, you developed your left side,

00:48:34.999 --> 00:48:37.208
then you come to right, you are alright.

00:48:37.500 --> 00:48:41.291
That's why we have our Sahaja Yoga completely built in

00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:43.083
on Shri Ganesh.

00:48:44.208 --> 00:48:47.208
Once he's there, you are completely alright

00:48:47.500 --> 00:48:50.500
and no problem. There's no lack of wisdom.

00:48:50.625 --> 00:48:53.208
Once you are with Shri Ganesh,

00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:57.834
you see the point, absolutely clearly,

00:48:58.083 --> 00:49:02.834
how to behave, how to live,

00:49:03.083 --> 00:49:07.834
and you don't take to stupid things like lust,

00:49:08.083 --> 00:49:09.291
greed and nonsense.

00:49:09.625 --> 00:49:11.417
But people are mad, you know,

00:49:11.625 --> 00:49:14.999
they take to any kind of thing when they grow up.

00:49:15.291 --> 00:49:17.917
But as children, if they have an influence,

00:49:18.208 --> 00:49:24.417
very beautiful influence of proper family life,

00:49:24.709 --> 00:49:30.834
proper school life, proper guidance,

00:49:31.083 --> 00:49:38.083
proper love and help in every way,

00:49:38.417 --> 00:49:42.834
in their growth, then children become extremely,

00:49:43.125 --> 00:49:45.542
extremely good, beautiful.

00:49:45.750 --> 00:49:49.750
And I bless all the Sahaja Yogis to have children

00:49:50.000 --> 00:49:55.125
of that nature, and to look after your children.

00:49:55.417 --> 00:49:59.750
That's very important, because they are tomorrow's Sahaja Yogis.

00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:02.834
And they should be of better quality.

00:50:03.125 --> 00:50:08.542
Because you are coming from another lot.

00:50:13.417 --> 00:50:16.125
They are coming from the innocence,

00:50:16.417 --> 00:50:20.208
so they are very pure,

00:50:20.542 --> 00:50:26.000
and their purity must be respected and must be guarded.

00:50:26.333 --> 00:50:30.959
Maybe that we'll understand the importance of children

00:50:31.208 --> 00:50:35.208
and develop Ganesha qualities in them.

00:50:35.542 --> 00:50:37.417
So, thank you very much
