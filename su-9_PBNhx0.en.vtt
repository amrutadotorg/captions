00:00:08.501 --> 00:00:13.534
So the value (of things) is not money

00:00:13.734 --> 00:00:17.000
this one should understand.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.734
What is the value of the thing?

00:00:22.334 --> 00:00:26.434
You want to give something to others,

00:00:26.601 --> 00:00:32.734
then the feelings you have in your heart is the value,

00:00:33.067 --> 00:00:36.801
and that value is the real Lakshmi.

00:00:40.367 --> 00:00:45.400
When you are, say, building a house,

00:00:47.534 --> 00:00:51.667
the plans you make and things you do,

00:00:52.334 --> 00:00:55.200
what is the idea behind

00:00:55.367 --> 00:01:01.334
and what you are trying to express through that house

00:01:01.501 --> 00:01:04.801
is the value of that house.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.734
Once you understand that you have to buy,

00:01:13.434 --> 00:01:18.267
with this Lakshmi, or you have to use this Lakshmi

00:01:18.467 --> 00:01:26.100
for certain value, and not for showing off or for money.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.701
This superficialness that we have about money

00:01:34.033 --> 00:01:38.634
itself is like an ordinary glass,

00:01:38.801 --> 00:01:44.434
but if you put behind the glass the mercury,

00:01:44.601 --> 00:01:48.100
you can see the value.

00:01:49.167 --> 00:01:56.367
So when you start buying something, what is the purpose,

00:01:56.534 --> 00:01:58.567
why are you buying it

00:01:58.734 --> 00:02:01.701
this will determine the value.

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:06.200
Like, last time I came to Portugal

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:11.400
and I said, "This year we'll go and buy some Terracotta"

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:13.701
but they are very expensive.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.167
I said, "This is the price",

00:02:17.501 --> 00:02:20.400
but I wanted to buy Terracotta from Portugal,

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:22.734
because it's very rich in that.

00:02:23.067 --> 00:02:29.334
So we went to one factory, and the factory was quite far out,

00:02:29.501 --> 00:02:34.467
none of them could find out, but I told them, "It's here only just go and see."

00:02:35.334 --> 00:02:38.534
And then we bought the Terracotta.

00:02:38.701 --> 00:02:42.067
But on our way I told,

00:02:42.701 --> 00:02:46.067
"Stop, stop here, stop."

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.133
So they stopped, there was a shop.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:54.200
I had to buy some things for Sahaja Yogis in India

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:58.367
and also for some people in Cabella.

00:02:58.534 --> 00:03:02.601
And that shop had such beautiful cottons.

00:03:03.334 --> 00:03:06.200
They were Sahaja Yogis from here who saw it

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.133
such beautiful clothes and I bought lot of it

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.467
I said, "Thank God the problem presents are finished now for India."

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.501
So joy-giving it was, everybody was surprised

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:25.434
why, suddenly in a place where never had been Mother there,

00:03:25.601 --> 00:03:29.033
suddenly She finds them.

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:35.234
It has a value, because I wanted to buy something for Indians

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.033
to be given as present.

00:03:38.467 --> 00:03:44.033
So if your Lakshmi is, say, this much,

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:49.067
once you add to it value it becomes so big.

00:03:51.067 --> 00:03:56.667
The sign of a person who is Lakshmipathi is this

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.334
he should have a house like the lotus in the hands

00:04:02.501 --> 00:04:05.734
of the Goddess,

00:04:06.067 --> 00:04:10.467
he should protect people who are depending on him,

00:04:10.634 --> 00:04:15.300
and from the left hand he should give.

00:04:16.734 --> 00:04:20.400
This is the image of the Lakshmi.

00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:24.267
This is what the Lakshmi is within you,

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.334
if you have these four things things in balance,

00:04:29.467 --> 00:04:32.334
without conditioning, without ego,

00:04:32.534 --> 00:04:35.567
then you are a Sahaja Yogi

00:04:35.734 --> 00:04:38.534
Otherwise you are not.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:44.667
On a Diwali day we have to promise ourselves

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:50.534
that whatever we are going to get now as Lakshmi principle

00:04:50.734 --> 00:04:54.000
or as a Lakshmi's prasad

00:04:54.167 --> 00:05:01.701
should be used in getting thing which has value.

00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:12.167
And thus you will learn that you have used your Lakshmi very well,

00:05:12.334 --> 00:05:18.033
and with that your Mahalakshmi principle becomes very strong.

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.540
Will become very strong by which you'll ascend very fast.
