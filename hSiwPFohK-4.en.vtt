00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:14.560
...which expresses itself in the gross

00:09:14.760 --> 00:09:17.560
out of these subtle centers.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.560
The left hand side of our subtle body is the blue column

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.520
is our psyche. It's our emotions. It's our past.

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.440
It's the part of us which is

00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.480
is our conditioning and creates what we might call our superego,

00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.960
our response mechanism, our reflex mechanism.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:40.240
It's our memory.

00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:44.040
The right hand side is our projection.

00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:46.720
It relates to our planning. It relates to our

00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.080
thinking, thinking, thinking.

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:52.480
And of course it relates to our ego.

00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:57.360
It's the mechanism by which we reach rational conclusions.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:10:01.520
It's through the right hand side that we analyze

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:04.680
and calculate and reach certain,

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:09.480
often illogical but rational conclusions.

00:10:09.680 --> 00:10:13.040
So we have to be careful that these imbalances

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:17.320
do not express themselves within us to any great extent,

00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.360
while the tendency is that while we will

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:21.560
move either too far to the left side

00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.000
or too far to the right side and so

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:28.200
move beyond our own personal subconscious

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.440
or our own personal supraconscious

00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:33.760
into an area which is

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.920
totally deluding and quite often dangerous

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:39.920
which is called the collective subconscious

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.840
the collective supraconscious which is

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:47.040
occupied by spirits of the dead

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:50.760
which can and do possess us.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.480
It ranges from dangerous zones

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:59.600
which give us such problems as alcoholism, cancer,

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.880
all sorts of power complexes

00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:05.680
the ultimate example of Hitler.

00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:08.080
So we have to be extraordinarily careful

00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.880
of these dabbling and [DILATANTE?] attitudes towards our seeking.

00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:19.160
I've been dealing with sick people in my professional life

00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.960
and I've seen so many seekers who've

00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:24.160
not only gone to these false gurus

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:26.240
and have been damaged

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:29.960
and come back worse for the spiritual pilgrimage.

00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:32.760
But I've seen many others who have

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:37.920
been equally damaged although perhaps not quite so

00:11:38.120 --> 00:11:40.960
openly and so obviously

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:46.440
such other more socially acceptable forms of seeking

00:11:46.640 --> 00:11:49.360
such as these courses in clairvoyance,

00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:51.880
such as charismatic church movement where

00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:54.800
there is obvious spiritual possession,

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:58.200
such as in for example the

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:02.560
calling down of spirits in the spiritualists church, such as

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:05.160
sitting in trance in circle and so on.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:08.920
We have to be careful of all of these areas as well

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.160
and I said we have to be very careful of healing

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:15.760
because who might be healing might be

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.880
the power of a very, very busy body or

00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:21.880
ego oriented spirit that is using our body

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.520
to achieve his own ego trip through us.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:26.000
Mind you

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:29.440
the person who is the host has to have a rather big ego as well

00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:32.600
to be an acceptable host to that busy body.

00:12:32.800 --> 00:12:34.120
But never mind.

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.680
This is often what happens.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:39.720
It has happened to me and I openly admit it.

00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.320
Since gaining my Self-realization

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.040
I gained a power which is far more subtle,

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:51.120
but far more all embracing and that is the power of God.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.400
The power that loves, that coordinates, that balances,

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:58.640
that dissolves all the negativity.

00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:01.560
Not by some trick of laying on of hands

00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.440
and you start shaking and sweating

00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:07.640
and some temporary relief takes place in the

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:09.840
physical body.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:12.920
Not perhaps as for example as I watched for two years

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:14.440
the Pilipino healers,

00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:18.280
where with all sorts of monsters they play around with tissue

00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.320
and they use spirits

00:13:21.520 --> 00:13:25.480
who dematerialize tissue and rematerialize tissue.

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:27.040
This is dangerous nonsense

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.880
and often interferes with the spiritual progress

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:34.400
of the patient and certainly the person who's doing the job.

00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.160
So beware of all these rather fringe areas,

00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.080
these danger zones in the field of spiritual seeking

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:46.600
and take to Sahaja Yoga because here you get your own powers.

00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:51.160
And those powers are very very subtle, very very sweet.

00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:56.160
And they are totally unrelated to spirit possession.

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.640
I'm dwelling a little on spirit possession because

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:02.160
perhaps Mother tonight will speak of that chakra where

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.160
this is a problem, the Swadhistan Chakra.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.240
So in our seeking take great care.

00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.960
Take great care that you have your own powers,

00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:18.720
that you are in control, that you become the master.

00:14:18.920 --> 00:14:21.280
This is what Self-realization gives you.

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.320
gives you that joy of the Spirit.

00:14:23.520 --> 00:14:26.920
It gives you that contact with the Divine

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:28.640
and you develop it.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.280
You find that your physical ills get better.

00:14:31.480 --> 00:14:34.160
You find that you can give realization to others.

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:36.560
You find that you can become your own doctor

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:39.680
and the doctor to others

00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:44.360
and you can enjoy the sweetness of collectivity

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.080
of really having brothers and sisters.

00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.800
Not talking about it but becoming

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.760
a very very beautiful part of an emerging spiritual civilization

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:58.560
which has been promised in all the scriptures.

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:01.320
If Mataji is the one who can do the job,

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:04.320
if She's the one who can, by Her power and love,

00:15:04.520 --> 00:15:06.280
raise this kundalini,

00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:10.040
be humble enough to accept it.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:13.320
Take it at least as a hypothesis.

00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:15.960
Allow it to develop within yourself.

00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.040
She suggests for at least eight days.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.720
Find out.

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.480
Develop it. Work it out.

00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.200
Know your own powers.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.920
Maneuver it.

00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:29.680
Allow yourself to

00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:33.000
enjoy the giving realization to others

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.440
and ultimately know that you are the Spirit.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:40.560
This is what it is. It's what you've been seeking.

00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:43.600
And yet I can't convince you.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:45.200
You have to find that out for yourself.

00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.120
In fact you needn't believe anything that I've said.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.640
What you have to do is you have to establish your vibrations.

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.200
You have to establish your kundalini awakening

00:15:55.400 --> 00:15:58.280
in such a way that you in fact

00:15:58.480 --> 00:16:02.400
prove for yourself that what I say is the truth.

00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:05.240
Again ladies and  gentlemen it is my great pleasure

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440
to introduce to you

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:11.840
Her Holiness Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:07.040
Perhaps while the film crew is finishing off their work

00:17:07.240 --> 00:17:09.960
I can just familiarize you with the chakras

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:13.600
chakras because these centers may be a little foreign to you

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:16.320
in terms of names so

00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:19.200
this Mooladhara Chakra lies

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:22.760
at the area which is at the base of the spine. Right here.

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:27.760
It relates to such areas of the spine- areas of the body

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:32.520
as the prostate gland. It relates to our sex and our sex organs

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.080
and supplies the energy in that area of the body.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:39.040
It's also related to the sacral and coccygeal plexus

00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.440
in the gross body.

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:43.200
And that's the center which has to be awakened.

00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:45.320
That's the center which

00:17:45.520 --> 00:17:51.200
has to begin the job of giving you Self-realization because

00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:55.760
here coiled up in the sacrum is the kundalini.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:58.080
Notice how it's above.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.360
Mother will explain in a moment

00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:01.840
a very significant point

00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:05.880
that this center is abovethe Mooladhara Chakra

00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:08.040
because it's the center of holiness.

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:10.760
It's the center of the holy Mother within you.

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:14.520
It's the center of the Holy Ghost within you.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:20.560
So again ladies and gentlemen with that little bit of understanding,

00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.480
Mataji Nirmala Devi.

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:46.280
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:54.960
As I told yesterday to you that truth is what it is.

00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.400
It will be what it will be.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:02.920
You cannot change truth for your adaptation

00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:05.240
or for your mental projection

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:09.360
or for your own convenience.

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.600
It will remain whatever it is.

00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:16.640
The first point of truth is

00:19:16.840 --> 00:19:19.680
that it establishes itself

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:26.160
despite all kinds of agencies

00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:32.320
or all kinds of forces which are anti-god.

00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:44.320
Second it is that it caters for the honest seekers.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:49.880
It's like a little root coming out of the seed,

00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:55.400
goes round and round, fix itself onto the source.

00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:05.640
The third is that it may shatter some of your ideas.

00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:11.280
It may upset some of your convictions.

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:16.240
But when it appears it is such a great joy

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:20.200
that absolutely you are lost

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:23.360
in the ocean of that enjoyment.

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.640
You forget everything that you have lost.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:31.880
You're happy that you have lost that dirty boat of yours.

00:20:32.080 --> 00:20:34.920
That hanging and everything that you had

00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:39.400
and now that you have become one with the ocean of joy.

00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.560
The truth is your Spirit.

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:49.720
It is eternal. It is the expression of God within you.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.080
Because we have not been able to achieve

00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.000
that in our consciousness,

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:01.560
we are disturbed, upset,

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:06.880
feel sometimes as if we are ruined people.

00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:10.960
But Spirit cannot be ruined.

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.840
It cannot be dried out.

00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:17.400
It cannot be killed.

00:21:18.040 --> 00:21:20.960
It resurrects you,

00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:27.320
fills you up with all the blessings of the Divine.

00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:31.240
That's the connection you have to get.

00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:33.400
Any instrument that is made

00:21:33.600 --> 00:21:37.680
if it is not connected to the mains has no meaning.

00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:43.560
In the same way you are made so beautifully,

00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:47.280
so gloriously and delicately.

00:21:47.480 --> 00:21:52.840
That only thing you have to so it to put to the mains .

00:21:53.040 --> 00:22:00.040
And the joy of becoming yourself is fantastic.

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.800
So the second point  which I said was that

00:22:03.960 --> 00:22:06.840
it can be shattered - your conviction.

00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:12.440
And that's why I have to tell you that when you listen to Me,

00:22:12.760 --> 00:22:14.440
you should not get upset.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.680
It is not at all to upset you.

00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:21.080
I have nothing to get from you, nothing to get.

00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:25.200
This is your own property within you

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:29.160
and you have to remove all the shackles,

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:34.240
all the overpowering ignorance

00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:39.600
and just get to the truth as it is and as it manifests.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.720
The manifestation of the truth the Spirit

00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:48.640
is beyond human understanding

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:54.840
in the sense that it is a happening.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:59.320
It happens to you that you become the Spirit.

00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:01.360
And something that has to happen

00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:05.480
cannot be comprehended with this limited brain

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:11.320
because I'm talking about something that is unlimited.

00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:14.480
So you have to

00:23:14.680 --> 00:23:18.160
be prepared to be triggered into the space

00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:20.840
which is unlimited.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:30.280
This happening is definitely miraculous and spontaneous.

00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.880
It is the greatest happening

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:36.240
that the human being can ever think of.

00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:40.240
It's described in short

00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:47.560
in so many verses of Koran.

00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:55.360
Quite clearly it was stated by Christ that you are to be born again.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.360
But Indian seers have seen it

00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.760
very clearly everything that works it out.

00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:08.240
They don't have any religion.

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.560
They don't follow any organization. They are seers.

00:24:11.760 --> 00:24:15.320
And they all have seen how it works out.

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.320
The knowledge that I'm telling you is not of today.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:24.360
But even 14,000 years back Markandeya, a great poet in India,

00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:26.320
has written about it.

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:30.600
Of course I have brought it to the modern standard to explain you.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:33.480
But when you read Markandeya you'll be amazed

00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.400
after realization that from his book you'll be getting vibrations.

00:24:38.600 --> 00:24:41.280
Recently about hundred years back

00:24:41.480 --> 00:24:44.840
William Blake, such a great poet of England,

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:48.880
has written absolutely everything about Sahaja Yoga

00:24:49.080 --> 00:24:52.120
how it is going work.

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.200
He has written that the men of God will become prophets

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:04.720
and these prophets will have powers to make others prophet.

00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:06.720
Clearly [he or He?] had said it.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:09.560
But I wonder how many people read [him or Him?] to understand

00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.680
what to expect that you have to become the prophet.

00:25:13.880 --> 00:25:17.720
If people say, "I am a prophet." All right so what.

00:25:17.920 --> 00:25:22.200
It makes no difference to you if I am a prophet.

00:25:23.280 --> 00:25:25.640
But you have to become the prophet.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:28.280
That's what [he or He?] has clearly said.

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:32.080
He has clearly said so many things that amazingly

00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.960
we have found even the places we were have got our ashrams.

00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:39.600
Even the place where I live

00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:45.200
[he or He] has very clearly stated the exact address of the place.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.680
What a seer England had

00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:51.360
and then ultimately [he or He?] says Jerusalem.

00:25:51.560 --> 00:25:54.840
England is going to be a Jerusalem nobody could have believed

00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.880
three hundred years back

00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.600
or even two hundred years back years, back even hundred years back.

00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:05.520
Even yesterday that is possible

00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:11.240
that English would represent Jerusalem.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:16.320
The place of pilgrimage

00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.920
where people will go for pilgrimage.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:24.440
But today I would say it is becoming.

00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:30.400
It is happening in England and should happen in Australia also

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:36.440
because I said Australia has a special place, very special place.

00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.680
In the cosmos of this universe

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:46.200
Australia is this great center, the first center of Mooladhara.

00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.360
And the proof of that is Aires Rock

00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:55.840
which has the same color the same shape.

00:26:56.040 --> 00:27:01.920
The deity's face also the same with the trunk in front.

00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.800
Australia stands for innocence.

00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:11.920
I wonder how many have retained their innocence.

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:17.440
They are innocent by birth.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:24.120
By the way God has blessed you.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:29.440
An innocent man is the wisest man. Is the wisest person.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:36.120
And he takes to wisdom very much easily.

00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:42.640
Only thing the confidence should be there and the self esteem

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.080
about yourself.

00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:50.840
These are the only two things which will bring out

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:52.720
that innocence within you

00:27:52.920 --> 00:27:56.040
which has to help the whole world to come around.

00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:59.160
I have great hopes from Australia

00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:04.960
because God has created it with a very big purpose.

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:07.840
So as he has told you today

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:11.640
about these three things we have

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.160
I will give you the permutations and combinations of these

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.960
how they work out within us.

00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:22.240
So please listen with understanding

00:28:22.440 --> 00:28:24.960
that whatever doesn't go with you,

00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:28.400
your ideas, you should not bother about it.

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:34.640
. I'm sure we will be able to prove it to you that this is so.

00:28:35.360 --> 00:28:42.400
Now the first power that is within us is the power of desire.

00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:48.720
The power of desire is the one that exists

00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:51.760
but is not apparent.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.560
This is the power which gives us emotions

00:28:55.760 --> 00:29:00.720
or is the power of our psyche, as they call it.

00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:04.760
This is the power that creates by its activity

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.680
on top of your head,

00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:10.360
more on the right hand side,

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.920
an institution called as superego.

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.720
Means all your conditionings are stored there.

00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:23.760
This works for your memory. For your past.

00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:30.000
And beyond that lies the area -

00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:37.080
beyond the left side lies the area of collective subconscious

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:40.800
because this looks after your subconscious.

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:43.800
And beyond that is the collective subconscious.

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:49.520
Means the area which is built within us since the creation.

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:55.240
The complete dead is on the left hand side.

00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:57.720
On the right hand side

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.640
there's another power which works out the action

00:30:00.840 --> 00:30:03.880
so we call it the power of action

00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:06.880
by which we act

00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:09.880
for our physical expression

00:30:10.080 --> 00:30:12.720
and for our mental expression.

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.040
By which we think for the future.

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:19.200
By which we plan out things.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:25.680
By which we rationalize and create another pouch like a balloon

00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:29.320
which is called as ego as a byproduct

00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.280
of the activity of this center.

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:37.200
Beyond this lies another area which is a supraconscious

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:42.600
and then collective supraconscious meaning all that is the future.

00:30:42.800 --> 00:30:46.440
So the people who are very futuristic,

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.480
very ambitious,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:51.920
who try to dominate others

00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:55.280
like Hitler you can call

00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.520
would reside in that area of collective supraconscious.

00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:07.640
In the center lies another power within us.

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:11.040
That's why Buddha always said keep to the center.

00:31:11.240 --> 00:31:15.920
Live a life of moderation and not the extremes.

00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:19.200
This central power is the power

00:31:19.400 --> 00:31:23.560
that gives us our human awareness.

00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:28.480
That carries us from a small little animal amoeba

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:33.200
to this stage of human level.

00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:39.240
So it is our evolutionary power within us.

00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:42.040
Scientists never thought on one point.

00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.680
Why did we become human beings?

00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:50.520
What was the need to make us human beings? For what purpose

00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:55.240
nature if they don't believe in God has created human beings?

00:31:55.440 --> 00:32:02.040
So this evolutionary powers work on a system called dharma

00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:04.440
means the one that is sustained.

00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:07.920
Also you can call the inner religion within us.

00:32:08.120 --> 00:32:11.440
The religion of carbon is four valencies.

00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.600
The carbon has four valencies

00:32:13.800 --> 00:32:18.160
and the carbon stage resides on the first center in a human being

00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:20.880
where carbon is a innocent thing.

00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:26.480
All animals are innocent.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:30.000
All matter is innocent.

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:34.560
If I put my hand in the fire it will burn.

00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:39.600
If I don't put my hand there it will not burn. It is innocent.

00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:45.440
Means it doesn't commit any sins because it has no concept of sin.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:49.080
Only the human beings have got the concept of sin

00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:53.560
through their ego and that's why they think they commit sins.

00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:55.720
Till you are a human being

00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:59.480
you'll always feel either you are committing sin

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:03.920
or you will think that others are committing sins.

00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:05.760
Either you will aggress others

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.760
or you'll take aggression upon yourself.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.760
So we have two types of people within us.

00:33:11.960 --> 00:33:14.320
Specially the ones who take aggression,

00:33:14.520 --> 00:33:17.320
the others who give aggression.

00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:20.560
The left side people are the people who take aggression.

00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:25.560
The right side people are the people who give aggression.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:30.760
That doesn't mean the person who takes aggression is a very good man

00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:34.360
or a person who gives aggression is a very bad man.

00:33:34.560 --> 00:33:37.640
According to Me, both of them are in the same way.

00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:43.040
Because if you trouble others you are aggressive.

00:33:43.240 --> 00:33:46.360
But if you torture yourself you are aggressive to yourself.

00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.680
And you have no business to torture yourself

00:33:48.880 --> 00:33:51.480
because this body is not created by you.

00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.760
It is created by God.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:57.360
And this human being is created so beautifully with such love

00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.360
by that creator for a purpose

00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:03.360
and you have no business to destroy because of your ego

00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.080
or because of your superego.

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.400
Now we have got two types of people

00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.800
as I tell you the left and right side people.

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:14.720
And there are people who are very much in the center

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.400
who lead a life of moderation

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.120
of understanding

00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:25.400
that life has to be worked out in a way that you get to God.

00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.320
That you get to your Spirit.

00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.760
They may not believe in God.

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.520
That's not necessary. They may not go to church.

00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:33.400
They may not go to temples.

00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.240
They may not do all these things but within themselves

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:40.080
they are people of moderation. They are good people.

00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:43.600
They are righteous people.

00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:46.440
They are people leading a good life

00:34:46.640 --> 00:34:49.840
neither aggressing nor taking aggression.

00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:53.080
They stand by those who are aggressed

00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:56.240
and they [ABHOR or APPAL?] people who aggress.

00:34:56.440 --> 00:34:58.240
And they tell the people who are aggressed

00:34:58.440 --> 00:35:00.440
that you should not take any aggression.

00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:05.680
These are the people who are in the center.

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:12.200
Now at this stage we have to combine these three types of people.

00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:15.920
One is a tamo guni as they call it on the left hand side.

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:17.680
Right side is rajo guni.

00:35:17.880 --> 00:35:23.800
And in the center is the person who stays as a [SATWA?] guni.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.880
Now the central person

00:35:26.080 --> 00:35:29.120
is very important from Sahaja Yoga point of view

00:35:29.320 --> 00:35:32.640
because he gets his realization without any difficulty

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:36.080
and he achieves it, understands it, and accepts it

00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.800
without any difficulty. Once it happens it just grows.

00:35:42.520 --> 00:35:45.160
The people who are very complicated

00:35:45.360 --> 00:35:49.960
either by over emotions or over mental activity

00:35:50.200 --> 00:35:53.880
are the people who are to be brought round to the center.

00:35:54.080 --> 00:35:56.480
And once their attention comes to the center

00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.680
then it is much easier to enlighten them.

00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:06.000
Now this kundalini which is the power within you of the Holy Ghost.

00:36:06.200 --> 00:36:12.520
Holy Ghost is the power of God which is all pervading.

00:36:12.720 --> 00:36:16.080
The power of God which is separated from God.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:22.720
God Almighty the Father is watching the work of this

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.760
power which is His own.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:31.640
Now you can see that this power of God is divided into four.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:35.880
Three of them as I've told you. The fourth one is the kundalini.

00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.400
The other day I told you kundalini is the pure desire within

00:36:40.600 --> 00:36:42.480
which you may not be aware of.

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:46.040
Is the purest desire within you.

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.720
And this pure desire is to be one with the Divine.

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:53.640
And this desire is absolutely

00:36:53.840 --> 00:36:58.280
waiting for a  moment when somebody could awaken it

00:36:58.480 --> 00:37:02.480
and give the second birth to Her only child.

00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:05.600
Everyone has an individual mother.

00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:08.040
This kundalini looks after.

00:37:08.240 --> 00:37:10.600
the one She give you conscience.

00:37:10.800 --> 00:37:12.920
She's the one who guides you.

00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:16.360
She's the one who saves you from difficult things.

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:20.040
She's the one who also nourishes your parasympathetic

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.640
which is in the center expressed in the center

00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:28.600
which coordinates and controls the sympathetic nervous system

00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:30.080
which are the left and right

00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.320
sympathetic nervous system in the human body.

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:37.600
Now the doctors don't understand this

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.880
so they don't understand how to differentiate

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.320
between a psychosomatic problem,

00:37:43.520 --> 00:37:46.040
between a physical problem,

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:48.120
between a mental problem,

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:55.440
and a problem that we can call of imbalances.

00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:59.880
And in that confusion most of the diseases are

00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:03.720
declared as incurable.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:11.040
Now to understand how deep
all these problems are

00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:15.960
one has to know that so far we have not reached the depth

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:19.400
where we could understand that

00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:22.680
all the problems that we face in our society,

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.640
in our politics,

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:26.440
in our economics,

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:29.200
or in our day to day life,

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:32.440
in our family, with our children,

00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:36.200
have got roots down below within ourselves

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.880
and if we could cure those roots

00:38:39.120 --> 00:38:43.280
we can completely change the whole world.

00:38:43.480 --> 00:38:45.200
The face of the whole world.

00:38:45.400 --> 00:38:48.320
And emancipation of the whole mankind

00:38:48.520 --> 00:38:52.600
is in the hands of today's people

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:59.320
who want first their correction of their instrument

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.160
and by that, correction of others.

00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:05.880
This time has been described before as the resurrection time

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:07.320
by Muhammad.

00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:11.760
the time of judgment by many others.

00:39:11.960 --> 00:39:16.360
In the Bible it's described at the time of judgment.

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:20.200
In the Sistine Chapel if you have seen

00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:24.640
the complete picture of the last judgment is so beautifully shown.

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.640
And the Agnya Chakra which is there

00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:29.120
which is [PRESIDED or RESIDED?] by Christ Himself

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:30.960
is absolutely shown there.

00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:34.280
Michelangelo himself was a realized soul

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.720
and he could see all these things so clearly.

00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:39.240
put them down in beautiful pictures.

00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:42.280
I wish you could have some chance to have a look at it

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:43.760
after your realization

00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:45.960
and you will be surprised that he has shown

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:51.640
how Christ is going to choose ultimately.

00:39:51.840 --> 00:39:55.120
Now at this time we have to see these three chakras

00:39:55.320 --> 00:39:57.880
plus the three

00:40:00.160 --> 00:40:02.000
channels that we have within ourselves.

00:40:02.200 --> 00:40:06.040
So the combination of these we have to see how they work it out.

00:40:06.240 --> 00:40:12.720
Now the first chakra if you notice is connected only to one side.

00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.080
That is the psyche.

00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:20.120
So when we start doing sex through our mental activity,

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:22.040
it is joyless.

00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.880
It is out of place.

00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:27.640
Reading about sex, thinking about sex,

00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:32.440
working it out through sex understanding through brain

00:40:32.640 --> 00:40:38.520
is absolutely useless because brain cannot understand sex.

00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:43.280
We talk so much about sex but people have no joy of sex I can see

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:47.440
because if you really achieve the joy of sex within yourself,

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:51.480
after some time you just become above sex.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:57.360
You mature into a personality where complete

00:40:57.560 --> 00:40:59.640
freedom is there from sex for you.

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:01.920
You are completely potent.

00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.960
You don't become impotent.

00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:10.080
But the whole movement of your complete energy

00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:15.800
goes towards your heart and not towards your sex.

00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:21.240
This is another type of

00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.200
world I come to sometimes in the West

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:28.640
where I'm surprised that people believe that sex plays a part

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:30.360
in their evolution.

00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:34.200
In India nobody is going to believe this.

00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.960
Even if you tell them Freud or anyone

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:38.360
they would say he must be mad.

00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:42.080
They are not going to believe because traditionally

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:45.520
it is proved. See all traditional countries - China same.

00:41:45.720 --> 00:41:48.880
I've talked to Egyptians, Chinese and Indians.

00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:50.320
They have the same views about sex

00:41:50.520 --> 00:41:52.400
and they just laugh at other people

00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:55.080
what are they doing where are they rambling?

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.800
Why are you wasting their energy?

00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.000
They just can't understand

00:41:58.200 --> 00:42:02.720
what's the matter with these people have they gone off their heads.

00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:08.600
But if you go to any newly born country

00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.880
they are better

00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:11.840
because also one reason

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.800
that sometimes tradition

00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:18.480
can clamp you down to certain things which could not be so helpful.

00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.880
But those who are [FAULT?] with their opinion even now

00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:24.240
are better because you can tell them

00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.680
that sex does not play part in your evolution.

00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:32.680
Now you can see that it lies below the kundalini.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.320
This center looks after all excretion

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.640
has got four petals

00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:41.960
as we have got four plexuses, sub-plexuses.

00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:49.000
We've got four sub-plexuses for our

00:42:49.480 --> 00:42:52.560
major plexus called as pelvic plexus within us.

00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.640
So in the gross the pelvic plexus

00:42:54.800 --> 00:43:00.120
represents in the gross this subtle center of Mooladhara.

00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:03.360
So the people who think too much about sex,

00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:04.960
study sex,

00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:08.080
and bother too much with their brains

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.480
are having a joyless pornography with them.

00:43:11.680 --> 00:43:14.040
It's absolutely joyless, absurd

00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:19.960
and creates the biggest problem for the society.

00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:22.200
First time when I went abroad

00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.400
abroad I [STARTED?] people looking at every woman

00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:25.240
looking at every man.

00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:27.920
Mad I'm seeing what's the matter with them.

00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:29.440
Very unsteady temperament.

00:43:29.640 --> 00:43:30.880
You know all the time looking at every woman

00:43:31.080 --> 00:43:32.160
looking at every man.

00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.200
You can't miss one.

00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:35.560
You see, even if there is a lady [UNCLEAR] going  on

00:43:35.760 --> 00:43:37.720
twisting your neck up to that and another falls down.

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:38.840
And then you say you have missed someone.

00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.240
There we should keep looking.

00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.960
And like mad you know all of them are going

00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:43.880
I said, "What's the matter?"

00:43:44.080 --> 00:43:45.440
Whether they are eighty year old,

00:43:45.640 --> 00:43:48.240
six year old, or ten year old, or even

00:43:48.440 --> 00:43:53.360
they are absolutely about to jump in the grave.

00:43:53.560 --> 00:43:55.600
Still in the grave they might be twisting their heads.

00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:59.440
It's stupid and it's stupidity.

00:43:59.640 --> 00:44:02.320
What do we get out of it?

00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.800
But the eyes are so now weak

00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:07.360
because after Sahaja Yoga when they come to me

00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:10.520
they tell Me, "Mother even now we cannot fix our eyes."

00:44:10.720 --> 00:44:12.040
There's something.

00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:14.560
Once one of the sahaja yogi was standing next to me.

00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.960
Suddenly he turned his head.

00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:17.240
I said, "What happened?"

00:44:17.440 --> 00:44:19.160
He said, "There's a lady standing behind me."

00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:21.600
So I said, "How is it you've got attracted to her?"

00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.280
There must be some sort of a

00:44:23.480 --> 00:44:26.320
thing behind your head and that's what it is here.

00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:30.240
That the Mooladhara is expressed at the back

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:35.080
here in the point which is jutting out of your

00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:40.040
brain and bones. That's the point is of Mooladhara.

00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:44.800
how it has an effect on the eyes. Because it goes on wobbling.

00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.520
There are two types of effects of Mooladhara

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.400
One is the right side another left side.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:52.240
If you are too much constipated person

00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.880
if you suffer from too much constipation

00:44:55.080 --> 00:44:58.440
you are a very strict man.

00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:01.520
Even you would not look at your wife, that sort of a person.

00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:04.720
There are that another extremes are there.

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:10.720
A nun or a priest or some sort of thing like that.

00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.840
Just forced celibacy

00:45:14.040 --> 00:45:18.800
and a very disciplined life. Such people can get Right Mooladhara.

00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.760
The Left Mooladhara - those people get it who are

00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:26.840
not at all have any respect for their chastity at all.

00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.560
These are the two types of extreme you go

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:32.720
because of the left and the right.

00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:35.160
But the left side

00:45:35.360 --> 00:45:38.880
Mooladhara is much more dangerous than the right side.

00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:43.440
Because at the most a person can get constipation or trouble of

00:45:43.640 --> 00:45:46.880
all these dryness in the body from the right side.

00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:48.600
But the left side Mooladhara

00:45:48.800 --> 00:45:53.320
those who indiscriminately use their chakras

00:45:54.920 --> 00:46:00.120
for a very licentious, permissive life and all that

00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:02.240
go into dangerous zones.

00:46:02.440 --> 00:46:04.800
Already nature has already shown that.

00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.480
Nature shows that.

00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:11.120
Sixty-five percent of young people in America are

00:46:11.320 --> 00:46:17.360
either impotent or are suffering from a terrible

00:46:19.200 --> 00:46:25.320
[INFLUX or INFLUENCE?] absolute horrible diseases which cannot be cured.

00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:30.920
You must be knowing that sailors when they travel

00:46:31.120 --> 00:46:34.360
they have to take an injection at every port.

00:46:34.560 --> 00:46:36.200
Because they are supposed to indulge into that

00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:40.720
but these days it is democracy so everybody is the same.

00:46:40.920 --> 00:46:42.960
"Demonocracy" I will call it.

00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:44.760
"Because the kings were like this,

00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:47.840
we should be. Why, what's wrong?"

00:46:48.040 --> 00:46:50.400
But you'll be amazed if this center is spoiled

00:46:50.600 --> 00:46:55.120
what diseases you can get is one of them is this mellitus.

00:46:56.160 --> 00:46:58.520
Not only but if a person has this disease

00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.160
any woman or man who lives with such a person

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:07.320
can contact horrible diseases at that point because of this center.

00:47:07.520 --> 00:47:12.240
That's why Christ has said that, "It is written in The Bible,

00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:16.920
'Thou shall not commit adultery.'"

00:47:17.120 --> 00:47:21.440
I say, "Thou shall not have adulterous eyes."

00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.480
To that extent He went.

00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.720
The purity of eyes is lost.

00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:31.080
And that's what He

00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:37.480
pointed out for today's time at this time that this will happen.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:46.680
So it creates so many problems in the married life itself.

00:47:47.920 --> 00:47:51.680
Now we see the combination how it works.

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:57.120
If you are a left sided sexual pervert

00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:01.960
you get into all kinds of nonsense.

00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:05.480
First of all you develop

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:09.040
funny relationships which I can't understand.

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:11.640
All sorts of funny relations.

00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:13.520
I was told yesterday there was some

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.960
homosexual who had some to fight Me

00:48:16.160 --> 00:48:19.600
but I never mentioned anything about sex so then he ran away.

00:48:19.800 --> 00:48:23.000
But it is a joyless sex habit.

00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:26.000
It is joyless.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:30.760
Apart from that it is unnatural.

00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:32.800
It gives problem to both of them

00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.760
and they are in for a trouble

00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:37.880
for a very serious disease within ten years all of them will suffer

00:48:38.080 --> 00:48:40.800
from either cancer or from mellitus. Take it from Me.

00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.480
Within ten years time.

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:46.160
Let them fight, go to the courts, get their rights to become [SAME or SIN?. -ed I think same].

00:48:46.360 --> 00:48:48.680
I have nothing to say.

00:48:49.760 --> 00:48:54.640
They are all going to suffer too much.

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:59.400
It's like you're going to the government and asking for right

00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:02.880
for getting yourself into disease or into madness.

00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:04.920
They'll become mad

00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:08.600
because if this center goes out here you become mad.

00:49:08.800 --> 00:49:10.880
You become a mad person.

00:49:11.080 --> 00:49:13.560
You become a crazy person.

00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:15.160
No wonder that

00:49:15.360 --> 00:49:21.000
you find more crazy persons in the west than in India.

00:49:21.280 --> 00:49:24.960
We may be poor people. At least we have some wisdom.

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:28.160
We have traditionally known that this is what happens.

00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:32.960
I just can't understand how people take to these things so easily

00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:36.160
and ask for it and go into troubles.

00:49:36.360 --> 00:49:40.080
So all these diseases like mellitus even cancer,

00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:41.880
cancer of the lower region.

00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:46.080
All these can be caused by these perverted people.

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:48.200
Apart from this perversion

00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.800
too much indulgences into all sorts of women

00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:55.960
and all sorts of prostitution and licentiousness is decadence.

00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.040
Is complete decadence of the society.

00:49:58.240 --> 00:50:00.600
How do we expect to have good children?

00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:04.840
How do you expect to have good relationship with your wife?

00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:08.080
In your family you have no nest there.

00:50:08.280 --> 00:50:10.200
You'll live with the [WILD WIND?].

00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:13.880
Like the [WILD WIND?] yourself.

00:50:16.440 --> 00:50:19.400
Imagine in India when they say that,

00:50:19.640 --> 00:50:22.880
"All right. If you have a person a stranger who comes to your house

00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.960
be careful. He might run away with your things."

00:50:25.160 --> 00:50:27.120
All right doesn't matter.

00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:30.480
But now in England, Indians say, "Don't allow any

00:50:30.680 --> 00:50:32.240
Westerner to come and stay in your house.

00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.880
He'll run away with your wife."

00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:41.480
I mean they remove the roots of the family absolutely.

00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.520
You go in a society. I find

00:50:43.720 --> 00:50:46.560
all the women and men are so upset

00:50:46.760 --> 00:50:50.640
or aggressive because they feel insecure.

00:50:50.840 --> 00:50:52.960
So insecure with each other.

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:54.840
They don't know what are these women are up to.

00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:57.280
The woman doesn't know what the man is up to.

00:50:57.480 --> 00:50:59.920
They are so insecure.

00:51:00.120 --> 00:51:03.960
If you travel abroad you meet somebody

00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:06.920
she say things like, "Of course my husband is not going to be

00:51:07.120 --> 00:51:10.640
a very good man, why should I be a good lady?

00:51:10.840 --> 00:51:12.520
Why should I be a good lady?

00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:15.960
If that my husband is not going to do that

00:51:16.200 --> 00:51:19.160
then why should I try to be a good person?"

00:51:19.360 --> 00:51:21.360
And the competition sets in in them.

00:51:21.560 --> 00:51:26.280
All sorts of funny things are going on in the name of enjoyment.

00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.400
This is the most joyless enterprise you are into.

00:51:33.320 --> 00:51:35.520
A man comes home.

00:51:35.720 --> 00:51:38.120
I saw this in England first time and I was shocked.

00:51:38.320 --> 00:51:41.600
We're living in an area which is really of very elite

00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:44.640
lords and ladies live there.

00:51:44.920 --> 00:51:46.640
And we had a neighbor about

00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:49.320
say forty-eight years of age or something.

00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:53.800
And her son who was living in a hostel brought another friend

00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.840
who was much younger to him.

00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:00.800
And this lady eloped with him.

00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:04.680
Stupid I tell you it is stupidity this old woman.

00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:07.440
They sold the house because she has a right.

00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:10.400
Even your laws must understand what they are doing.

00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.640
She sold the house. They had three daughters.

00:52:13.840 --> 00:52:17.560
Three daughters are on the street like prostitutes now.

00:52:17.800 --> 00:52:19.720
Father has no control.

00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.240
He has so called married another woman.

00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:23.400
It's absurd.

00:52:23.600 --> 00:52:27.080
This is not the way the society is going to work out.

00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:29.920
There's something definitely very wrong with us

00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:33.440
because we do not understand that chastity

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.200
is the greatest thing a human being can have.

00:52:37.400 --> 00:52:41.240
It's the power that a man has is of his chastity

00:52:41.440 --> 00:52:42.680
and a woman has.

00:52:42.880 --> 00:52:45.720
People ask me about Mahatma Gandhi.

00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:51.440
I mean he was a man who was so chaste, his wife so chaste.

00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:54.360
I mean we have had many people like that India

00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:55.880
except for the city people are different.

00:52:56.080 --> 00:52:58.120
But in the villages they don't think

00:52:58.320 --> 00:53:00.880
of these things, and they live very normally.

00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:03.160
While it's such a kind of a

00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.920
inferiority complex put into everyone.

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:08.560
a sign of inferiority complex only

00:53:08.760 --> 00:53:13.800
that you want to attract every man and woman on the street.

00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:15.560
If you are really good

00:53:15.760 --> 00:53:18.480
why should you worry about attracting everyone you see?

00:53:18.680 --> 00:53:21.120
And advertising.

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.880
Another thing is that, people think that

00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:30.080
when a lady is good looking you must have her.

00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:31.520
This is absurd again.

00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.720
How are you looking? Please see in the mirror.

00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:40.840
Why every man wants a beautiful woman

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:46.520
and why every beautiful woman wants a beautiful man?

00:53:46.720 --> 00:53:48.000
I can't understand.

00:53:48.200 --> 00:53:51.760
But then only two, three persons can marry in this world.

00:53:51.960 --> 00:53:55.800
Because the others are just looking at them flabbergasted.

00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:58.240
But what you have why don't you enjoy?

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:00.360
A simple thing as that.

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.360
You have your wife. You have your husband.

00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:07.600
Why not enjoy them?

00:54:09.720 --> 00:54:13.240
Want to enjoy somebody else's wife?

00:54:15.760 --> 00:54:20.680
Thou shall not covet your neighbor's wife.

00:54:32.920 --> 00:54:37.480
This behavior is to be changed

00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:40.400
But you cannot change it overnight. I understand that.

00:54:40.600 --> 00:54:43.480
Only way is that you must ascend.

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:46.120
When you become the Spirit there is second birth

00:54:46.320 --> 00:54:48.040
everything is washed off.

00:54:48.240 --> 00:54:53.240
I've seen many homosexuals - they can become sensible.

00:54:53.440 --> 00:54:58.200
Many prostitutes have become very sensible women.

00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.240
But that's what happened to Mary Magdalene

00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:03.240
when she came to Christ.

00:55:03.640 --> 00:55:06.640
This is what the purity has to do is to purify you

00:55:06.840 --> 00:55:10.280
and to give you the maximum joy of life.

00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.200
From married life you have no joy.

00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.080
You are all the time fighting on something,

00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:17.080
on material things, on this and that and that.

00:55:17.280 --> 00:55:22.760
But if that innate understanding between both of them is made.

00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:25.560
Only the people who take maybe those drugs

00:55:25.760 --> 00:55:29.440
may not be fighting because they have become cabbages now.

00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:32.120
If you have no power to fight and if you don't fight,

00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:35.120
what is so great?

00:55:36.720 --> 00:55:41.080
To substantiate your society with real source of joy

00:55:41.280 --> 00:55:42.920
you must establish this center

00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:45.800
which Australians can do much faster than anybody else

00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:51.080
because now I have got disciples from twelve countries

00:55:51.280 --> 00:55:55.680
and the best among them on this point are Australians.

00:55:55.880 --> 00:56:01.400
Overnight they are changed people. Overnight. Wonderful people.

00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:07.040
But to a western mind it's not a serious thing

00:56:07.240 --> 00:56:09.160
because they cannot locate it.

00:56:09.360 --> 00:56:14.120
They cannot relate it to the disease that is causing it.

00:56:14.320 --> 00:56:19.680
It's so such an open truth that

00:56:19.880 --> 00:56:23.160
people who indulge into these bad habits develop

00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:24.520
very bad diseases

00:56:24.720 --> 00:56:27.760
even some of the leprosies among the kind of leprosies

00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:30.200
are developed by that.

00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.520
But the modern diseases are even worse.

00:56:33.720 --> 00:56:37.320
I met a gentleman who has mellitus.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:39.280
And his wife was a mad woman.

00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:41.840
But he liked her despite her madness and all that.

00:56:42.040 --> 00:56:43.960
He should have put her in a lunatic asylum.

00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:47.640
And he developed this from the Left Mooladhara.

00:56:47.800 --> 00:56:51.640
Now to cure these people is very easy.

00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:54.480
You have to just raise the kundalini

00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.760
and the kundalini can enlighten that center

00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:03.360
and your innocence can come back.

00:57:03.560 --> 00:57:07.680
Your chastity will show its result.

00:57:07.880 --> 00:57:10.640
Your face will change.

00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:14.320
People I have seen after realization become twenty years younger

00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:16.160
immediately

00:57:16.320 --> 00:57:17.960
because of this center

00:57:18.160 --> 00:57:22.680
which is bestowed upon by the deity of Shri Ganesha

00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:29.960
who is the embodiment of eternal childhood.

00:57:31.200 --> 00:57:34.800
And this Shri Ganesha later on takes His birth

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.440
at the higher chakra called Agnya

00:57:37.640 --> 00:57:40.720
as our Lord Jesus Christ.

00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:46.960
That I'll tell you tomorrow about Jesus Christ who He was,

00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.520
how He came on this Earth

00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:50.600
and what are the reference to Him

00:57:50.800 --> 00:57:55.080
in the ancient scriptures of India.

00:57:56.400 --> 00:58:01.480
So the center of Mooladhara - the lesser the better.

00:58:02.280 --> 00:58:05.800
I think it is for you to understand

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:11.120
that chastity plays a very important part.

00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:14.320
If the person has got this problem

00:58:14.520 --> 00:58:17.600
then the kundalini does rise no doubt.

00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.480
It rises but is again sucked back.

00:58:21.680 --> 00:58:24.440
Even the people who are too much on the right hand side

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:27.560
always think too much and work very hard

00:58:27.760 --> 00:58:32.480
and earning money for their wives find their wives run away.

00:58:32.880 --> 00:58:37.000
Because they are very hard people to live with.

00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:41.960
They are very hot tempered, irritable, and aggressive.

00:58:42.200 --> 00:58:44.560
So here the man earns everything for the wife

00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:48.880
and there he finds the wife has run away by the time he comes home.

00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:55.720
So this chakra is the basis of our lives.

00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:59.520
Chastity is the basis of our life.

00:58:59.720 --> 00:59:03.560
You must have heard that women in India - thousands of them

00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.840
put up a pyre and burnt themselves off

00:59:08.040 --> 00:59:10.240
called as [JEOPARD?]

00:59:10.440 --> 00:59:14.320
because they thought that the Muslim invaders will come

00:59:14.520 --> 00:59:18.800
and molest their chastity.

00:59:19.560 --> 00:59:22.480
Because traditionally they have realized that chastity

00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:25.280
is the power of a woman.

00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:26.760
Same of the man.

00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.120
Of course men don't believe in chastity at all.

00:59:29.320 --> 00:59:32.720
You see, they think they are not men if they are chaste.

00:59:33.960 --> 00:59:38.800
such a man who has no chastity is not at all a man.

00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:43.040
Not at all a man. He's something in between.

00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:49.440
Anyone who has chastity

00:59:50.120 --> 00:59:54.040
chastity can see from the way he talks with his confidence with his

00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:55.920
complete understanding of the whole thing.

00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.760
Such person surpasses everybody else.

00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:03.080
And even after the death of such a licentious man

01:00:03.280 --> 01:00:06.960
he may be the biggest man, people talk about him.

01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.040
You cannot adore a man of that kind.

01:00:11.400 --> 01:00:12.920
"Oh it's all right he was great

01:00:13.120 --> 01:00:15.120
but he had this nonsense business with him.

01:00:15.320 --> 01:00:18.800
He was going about with such and such actress."

01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:22.320
You don't respect such a man because I have not seen anyone

01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.360
putting up statues of people who were great because of

01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:30.160
their unchaste behavior. I haven't seen anyone.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.600
Or because he was a great homosexual you put up a

01:00:33.800 --> 01:00:38.240
big statue of him. A great homosexual.

01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:40.360
I mean you may do it later on.

01:00:40.560 --> 01:00:42.920
I don't know to what extent one can go

01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:45.120
with this madness what wrong

01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:48.640
I have not seen anyone  putting up a perverted man.

01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:51.640
All right put a statue of him and garland him.

01:00:51.840 --> 01:00:56.760
I've not seen even the silliest of silly respecting such a people.

01:00:58.720 --> 01:01:02.280
There's a clan in India called as

01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:05.360
[ZARCOMES?]. They are of a right type.

01:01:05.560 --> 01:01:10.120
They too worship a goddess who is a very strict goddess.

01:01:10.320 --> 01:01:14.160
They too want to ask her for blessing that they should not

01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:16.840
be like this in next life whatever they have done in previous life.

01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:18.200
That's why they have become like this.

01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.600
Now next life at least should be good.

01:01:20.800 --> 01:01:25.960
So they try to worship a goddess which is a very strict goddess.

01:01:26.200 --> 01:01:31.480
They give all punishments to us but don't give us this life.

01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:35.400
So this is the basis that we have

01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.760
and we have to ascend to the spirit.

01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:46.080
Now the another chakra we have is the Swadhisthana Chakra.

01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:50.640
As you can see that it is connected to the right side.

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:53.080
But it moves to the right and left.

01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:56.360
It is like a lotus with a stem

01:01:56.560 --> 01:01:59.720
which moves in that area that is shown the green part

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:03.760
which is [UNCLEAR].

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:06.680
And here the attention resides.

01:02:06.880 --> 01:02:09.920
Human attention resides here.

01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.280
This center comes out of the third center which you see there

01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:14.880
as the green one

01:02:15.080 --> 01:02:22.080
called as the center of your seeking.

01:02:22.880 --> 01:02:28.600
The first one I told you is the center of innocence.

01:02:28.800 --> 01:02:31.240
The second one of creativity.

01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:35.000
And the third one of seeking.

01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.720
This is the most important center

01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:43.200
within us because of seeking we have become human beings.

01:02:43.400 --> 01:02:45.960
First we were seeking

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:53.400
only food, then a shelter, then a society.

01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:59.400
Then of course money, possessions, politics, power.

01:02:59.600 --> 01:03:02.520
Ultimately you become subtler and subtler because

01:03:02.720 --> 01:03:05.680
is trial and error method.

01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:07.680
You try this. Get fed up.

01:03:07.880 --> 01:03:10.320
Next life you come you become something else.

01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:13.200
That life you try something. You become something else.

01:03:13.400 --> 01:03:15.880
That's how the human beings work it out

01:03:16.080 --> 01:03:19.320
ultimately come to a point that there is no sense in all these

01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.440
pursuits. Forget it.

01:03:21.640 --> 01:03:23.840
There must be something beyond

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:29.280
and that's the real place where you have to arrive.

01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:32.200
That it is the Spirit we are seeking.

01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:38.400
In all these things there was nothing but a just a mirage

01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:39.840
of joy.

01:03:40.040 --> 01:03:41.960
There is no joy in all these things

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:45.440
so we should give up this mirage and take to reality.

01:03:45.640 --> 01:03:48.160
That is the Spirit within us.

01:03:48.360 --> 01:03:51.480
In this seeking we have two types of people again

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.800
the left sided and the right sided.

01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.960
The left sided people think that

01:03:57.200 --> 01:04:01.120
if they have their own family - mostly Indians are like that.

01:04:01.320 --> 01:04:04.040
They believe in the family system to such an extent

01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.120
that they can sell their country sometimes

01:04:06.320 --> 01:04:09.560
for their own children's sake, for their sons.

01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:13.120
Thus, they have no sense of collectivity in them.

01:04:13.320 --> 01:04:15.000
When it comes to such a

01:04:15.200 --> 01:04:18.200
close [UNCLEAR] feeling for your own family

01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:21.120
that if your son - even if he's a murderer

01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.760
still he's your own son.

01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:27.840
So in relation to the whole you must think of your family.

01:04:28.040 --> 01:04:31.200
The left sided people can be also extremely emotional type.

01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:34.360
So all their creativity goes to the emotional side

01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.960
like they become poets

01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:42.160
sing the song of [LAMENTATION?],

01:04:42.360 --> 01:04:47.720
anguish, sufferings, all kinds of sufferings they have.

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:50.280
This is not a very kind thing to do

01:04:50.480 --> 01:04:51.960
to make others cry you see.

01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:54.800
There are some poets who make you so much cry

01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.880
that they'll take out your eyes and wash it and put it back.

01:04:58.080 --> 01:05:01.520
To that extent they are horribly sadistic

01:05:01.720 --> 01:05:04.760
like Lord Byron, horrible fellow.

01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.200
He wrote this so many things.

01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:11.440
He himself led a most licentious and a horrid life.

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:13.680
He was an aggressive man.

01:05:13.880 --> 01:05:18.120
He did all that to aggress others, torture others.

01:05:18.320 --> 01:05:24.400
And here he's writing the poetry of how man suffers.

01:05:25.120 --> 01:05:26.560
Just imagine

01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:31.240
what a dishonest and a cheat he was to talk like this.

01:05:31.440 --> 01:05:33.680
He was such an arrogant man

01:05:33.880 --> 01:05:35.600
that he went to Portugal.

01:05:35.800 --> 01:05:38.280
There's a beautiful place called Sintra there.

01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:40.200
Beautiful place.

01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:41.920
So he says that

01:05:42.120 --> 01:05:44.840
Sintra is too beautiful to be wasted on Portuguese.

01:05:45.040 --> 01:05:47.280
As if he is the most beautiful man ever,

01:05:47.480 --> 01:05:52.640
meaning that all this beauty should flow to this horrible person.

01:05:55.640 --> 01:05:58.120
This creates an imaginary you see

01:05:58.320 --> 01:05:59.760
an [UNCLEAR] to suffer.

01:05:59.960 --> 01:06:02.480
I've met many like that.

01:06:02.680 --> 01:06:05.560
They are poetically suffering. See.

01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:08.520
They enjoy all the songs of suffering

01:06:08.720 --> 01:06:11.520
and then they become themselves tragic.

01:06:11.720 --> 01:06:14.520
Such people cannot give joy to anyone.

01:06:14.720 --> 01:06:16.440
I mean people run away

01:06:16.640 --> 01:06:19.960
from such people. They think he is a person who is a mourner.

01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.920
In India you see we pay these mourners.

01:06:23.120 --> 01:06:26.440
If somebody dies and has no mourners they can be paid.

01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.640
And they are brought for crying and weeping

01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:30.360
and saying all these things you see

01:06:30.560 --> 01:06:32.600
there are people paid for it in India. Imagine.

01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:35.120
I mean we use them for  this purpose.

01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:37.960
Artificially they can mourn somebody's death

01:06:38.160 --> 01:06:40.400
and earn some money out of it.

01:06:40.600 --> 01:06:44.600
But such kind of miserable people

01:06:45.080 --> 01:06:47.640
are such a

01:06:47.840 --> 01:06:49.840
blot on the name of God

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.440
who has given you so much.

01:06:52.640 --> 01:06:55.720
Count your blessings.

01:06:55.920 --> 01:06:59.280
Count your blessings one by one.

01:06:59.480 --> 01:07:01.480
First of all that

01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:06.080
you are not under the control of the nature, the parsha.

01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:10.080
You are a free human being.

01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:12.080
So many things He has given you

01:07:12.280 --> 01:07:14.280
and still you are weeping and crying

01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:18.000
and saying that we have to suffer.

01:07:18.200 --> 01:07:20.560
who believe in suffering will get it.

01:07:20.760 --> 01:07:23.480
You want suffering? Then have it.

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:25.480
They get it.

01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.720
And these people can really go so much with it

01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:32.560
about the suffering part

01:07:32.760 --> 01:07:38.960
that recently I met one group in Spain.

01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:42.120
And I said, "What are you doing about your seeking?"

01:07:42.320 --> 01:07:44.160
They said, "We are going to Gobi Desert."

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.560
I said, "For what?"

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.200
"There's the Shambhala is there."

01:07:47.400 --> 01:07:48.760
I said, "What is that Shambhala?"

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:52.160
"It's the God's heaven in Gobi Desert. And there's a gentleman

01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:53.920
who is going to take us to the Gobi Desert

01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.640
and we are going to walk in the center of Gobi Desert."

01:07:56.840 --> 01:07:57.720
I said, "Very nice."

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:00.360
"And we are paying so much money for that."

01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:02.040
Now in that Gobi desert

01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:06.640
you can't get even a drop of water.

01:08:06.840 --> 01:08:07.880
You pay lot of money

01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.640
to go to that Gobi Desert,

01:08:09.840 --> 01:08:11.600
walk across, and die there.

01:08:11.800 --> 01:08:14.760
And this man gets all the money you know befooling [HERE?].

01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.480
"But then we must suffer."

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.520
For what?

01:08:18.720 --> 01:08:21.720
Why you want to suffer?

01:08:21.920 --> 01:08:25.160
Christ has suffered for you enough.

01:08:25.360 --> 01:08:27.280
If Christ is awakened within you

01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:30.520
He will take up everything upon Himself.

01:08:30.720 --> 01:08:33.360
He'll really wash all your sins

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.680
and you can get your realization.

01:08:35.880 --> 01:08:38.120
That's how it works so quick.

01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:41.160
If you know how to enlightened Him within yourself

01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:42.920
then it works out.

01:08:43.120 --> 01:08:46.400
Still the Christians are even continuing with ideas

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:47.760
leave alone the Jews.

01:08:47.960 --> 01:08:51.600
Christians are just the same.

01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:56.480
And they enjoy you see this kind of suffering upon themselves.

01:08:56.680 --> 01:08:58.840
Is all imaginary.

01:08:59.040 --> 01:09:03.560
Like we went to France in Paris.

01:09:03.760 --> 01:09:06.960
"We are all miserable people le miserable."

01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:08.320
And they told Me,

01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:10.520
"Don't tell them Mother that you are happy, you know.

01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:11.800
They'll not like it.

01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:13.960
You better tell that you are the most miserable."

01:09:14.200 --> 01:09:16.040
Le miserable.

01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:19.600
All miserables sitting there.

01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:21.960
I said, "What miserable they are."

01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:25.760
Every third lamppost you'll find a pub

01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:29.480
and every seventh lamppost you'll find a prostitute.

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:31.960
This is the miserable thing they have.

01:09:32.160 --> 01:09:36.640
Do miserable people do all these things?

01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.400
Just sitting outside for the last doomsday,

01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:41.800
the calamity. They'll have it

01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.400
if they want to have it.

01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:47.320
But God has not created you to be miserable at all.

01:09:47.520 --> 01:09:48.720
No, not at all.

01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:53.400
He has created you to be very happy and joyous

01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:58.440
to enjoy the beauties of His bounties.

01:09:58.640 --> 01:10:00.720
We are really letting Him down

01:10:00.920 --> 01:10:03.400
and it's really such a miserable thing. Supposing now

01:10:03.600 --> 01:10:05.400
you want to invite somebody to your house.

01:10:05.600 --> 01:10:08.600
Your own son is coming. You are so excited about him.

01:10:08.800 --> 01:10:11.800
You are so anxious that your son after such a long time

01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:13.480
such a long journey

01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:16.200
is coming as a glorious man to your house

01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:21.560
and then he's weeping saying, "I'm miserable."

01:10:22.840 --> 01:10:26.080
So those people who indulge into the left side of the Swadhisthana

01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:27.880
so much

01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.960
suffer

01:10:31.160 --> 01:10:33.880
because they enter into an area called

01:10:34.080 --> 01:10:35.600
collective subconscious

01:10:35.800 --> 01:10:39.200
and this is the area which the other day doctors pointed out.

01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:41.960
they were studied the cancer disease they said

01:10:42.200 --> 01:10:46.760
a vulnerable person who is vulnerable to cancer

01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:49.120
the one who's an extreme temperament person.

01:10:49.320 --> 01:10:52.440
A person who is extremely hard working can be vulnerable also.

01:10:52.640 --> 01:10:57.880
But is triggered, is triggered by

01:10:58.080 --> 01:11:02.440
a protein which they call as protein 58

01:11:02.640 --> 01:11:05.760
or protein 52

01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.320
which enters into the being,

01:11:08.520 --> 01:11:12.360
which triggers it, and this protein one

01:11:12.560 --> 01:11:15.440
is coming from the area called as

01:11:15.640 --> 01:11:17.480
according to them we call it

01:11:17.680 --> 01:11:20.080
collective conscious. Collective subconscious.

01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:26.200
But they call it the area built in within us since the creation.

01:11:26.440 --> 01:11:31.200
I mean they say something else. We make it clearer that's all.

01:11:31.400 --> 01:11:34.120
And cancer is caused by that.

01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:38.720
Invariably I have seen those people who have come to Me from cancer

01:11:38.920 --> 01:11:41.560
have been the people who got it from left side.

01:11:41.760 --> 01:11:47.640
You wanted to suffer? All right have cancer. Enjoy it.

01:11:48.600 --> 01:11:51.800
But there was a journalist who came to see Me in America

01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:55.960
and I told him that you should not suffer.

01:11:56.160 --> 01:11:59.080
So he folded everything. He said, "I'm going back".

01:11:59.280 --> 01:12:01.920
He said, "It is my right to suffer."

01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.080
Imagine. I said, "Now what to say to this man?"

01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:07.560
I said, "All right then go ahead with it.

01:12:07.800 --> 01:12:09.800
When you are fed up with it you come to Me.

01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:13.680
But just now you have a right to suffer. Do what you like."

01:12:13.880 --> 01:12:17.120
If somebody wants to hit himself

01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.880
with a bamboo or something

01:12:20.080 --> 01:12:21.320
and you say, "Why do you want to hit yourself?"

01:12:21.520 --> 01:12:23.200
Say, "It's a right, my right to hit myself."

01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:27.000
I said, "All right hit." But you have no right

01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:30.200
because you cannot create yourself.

01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.920
You have no right to torture yourself.

01:12:33.120 --> 01:12:36.120
You have no right to make yourself miserable.

01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:39.320
You have to make yourself happy people,

01:12:39.520 --> 01:12:40.960
joyous people,

01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:45.160
blissful people so that God feels

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:48.120
you have received blessings.

01:12:48.320 --> 01:12:50.280
That He may be placed

01:12:50.480 --> 01:12:56.240
through His own creation that is the epitome, the human beings.

01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:00.080
That's the best way you should please God by saying,

01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.760
"Father we are very happy people.

01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:07.200
Don't worry about us. We are so thankful to You."

01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.800
So that's how the joy killers come to us from the left side.

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.320
The right side is the people who kill others' joy.

01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:18.800
Spoil sports as you call them in a very mild way.

01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.960
They are the ones who are aggressive.

01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:24.200
They cannot see anybody being peaceful.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.760
Even countries can be like that.

01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.440
Collectively they can do like this.

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:31.600
If they see any country is peaceful, they'll attack.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.360
"Why is he peaceful?

01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:37.640
We must attack and capture that country."

01:13:37.840 --> 01:13:44.040
The people who cannot bear the joy of other people

01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:48.360
become aggressive and try to aggress them.

01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:54.760
There are people who just get sometimes jealous.

01:13:55.240 --> 01:14:00.440
Sometimes just for aggression they become aggressive.

01:14:00.640 --> 01:14:01.920
I have no reason sometimes

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:05.120
the way people suddenly shoot up like Jack in the Box

01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:07.960
and start talking in such an aggressive manner

01:14:08.200 --> 01:14:10.640
you don't understand why should we aggress.

01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:13.280
is no need to aggress at all.

01:14:13.480 --> 01:14:15.320
But they go on aggressing people.

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:16.600
Then they may form

01:14:16.800 --> 01:14:19.080
a thing like as a German state

01:14:19.280 --> 01:14:22.840
that we are a superior race, a sense of superiority.

01:14:23.040 --> 01:14:29.960
All your racialism comes from this nonsense of a aggression.

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:35.120
I mean I can't understand Western people.

01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:39.280
For example they're so particular about their race being preserved

01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:41.600
because they think they are white skin.

01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:45.200
But they go to the sea, make it black. Why?

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:49.240
I mean either you are white skin or you have black. One of the two.

01:14:49.440 --> 01:14:51.320
So they are so confused.

01:14:51.520 --> 01:14:52.960
They think they are not beautiful

01:14:53.200 --> 01:14:55.840
because they are white skin, light skin.

01:14:56.040 --> 01:14:56.960
So if you are not so beautiful

01:14:57.200 --> 01:15:00.440
then why do you think you are above the world?

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:03.680
Racialism is something so much

01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:06.760
a mental projection, absolutely a mental projection

01:15:06.960 --> 01:15:12.360
and with this mental projection we gather so much of

01:15:12.560 --> 01:15:16.920
curses of [THE OTHER WORLD?].

01:15:17.120 --> 01:15:20.320
I'll give you an example. We went to China.

01:15:20.520 --> 01:15:23.680
And Chinese are so much against British I was surprised.

01:15:23.880 --> 01:15:26.280
So much against. The worst are British according to them.

01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:27.920
They had seven aggressors.

01:15:28.120 --> 01:15:30.520
I said, "Why?"

01:15:30.720 --> 01:15:32.960
Because they gave them dopes you see.

01:15:33.160 --> 01:15:35.600
And if you ask the British of that time they will say that,

01:15:35.800 --> 01:15:36.840
"Because they deserved it.

01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.880
We gave them. See, what's wrong?"

01:15:42.080 --> 01:15:44.560
But when I told them that

01:15:44.760 --> 01:15:47.240
Britishers are taking drugs and all that. "Nice for them.

01:15:47.440 --> 01:15:49.080
Let them all take it.

01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:52.240
That's what they deserve.

01:15:52.440 --> 01:15:56.920
They're drunkards. Let them have the drugs."

01:15:57.120 --> 01:15:59.600
Nobody will have the sympathy with people who are aggressors.

01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.120
If you think you are a great [RACE?], go ahead with it.

01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:06.480
And the more [RACE?] is going toward the doom.

01:16:06.680 --> 01:16:10.240
You must know you must learn from others also.

01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:12.920
People have learned from you politics, economics.

01:16:13.120 --> 01:16:14.560
I don't know what you've made out of it.

01:16:14.760 --> 01:16:16.320
If you think you have done very good, well,

01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:18.080
I have nothing to say.

01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:19.840
Also other things they have learned from you.

01:16:20.040 --> 01:16:23.240
English language I have learned.

01:16:24.480 --> 01:16:27.840
And why do you call everybody a lower

01:16:28.040 --> 01:16:29.800
developed thing? You are a developed country.

01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:31.160
What have you developed?

01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:33.840
Atom bombs to kill yourself?

01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:35.880
What have you developed?

01:16:36.080 --> 01:16:37.760
All kinds of aggressiveness.

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:40.440
You go to other country with a Bible in the hand and another

01:16:40.640 --> 01:16:45.440
a pistol in the your hand or a rifle in your hand to kill others.

01:16:45.720 --> 01:16:48.440
This aggression comes from mental projection that we have

01:16:48.640 --> 01:16:52.120
that we are great you see puffed up.

01:16:52.320 --> 01:16:55.600
The best for that is Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall.

01:16:55.800 --> 01:16:57.000
That's the one it is.

01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:58.760
Is that the Humpty Dumpty's.

01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:01.400
I tell you all [RIGHTS? HEIGHTS?].

01:17:01.600 --> 01:17:04.120
All [RIGHTS? HEIGHTS?] are so sensible.

01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:06.560
And they said the Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall

01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.720
and Humpty Dumpty had a big fall.

01:17:08.920 --> 01:17:12.880
And all the king's horses and men could not put them together again.

01:17:13.080 --> 01:17:16.040
That's what it is a Humpty Dumpty a big ego like a balloon.

01:17:16.240 --> 01:17:18.360
They'll float like as if something

01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.280
you see like angels in the world

01:17:20.480 --> 01:17:21.720
while when they'll reach

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.880
the kingdom of God, God will say, "What business you had to hate

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:29.040
any part of this creation.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:30.720
Who are you I don't know."

01:17:30.920 --> 01:17:34.040
Because in collectivity you are so poor in this respect.

01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.680
So we have to understand

01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:37.880
that God has created all of us.

01:17:38.080 --> 01:17:40.360
We have to have variety.

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:42.200
It looks nice

01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.640
that you wear another dress. I wear another dress.

01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:46.840
I have another face. You have another face.

01:17:47.040 --> 01:17:50.960
Unless and until there are variety in the nature

01:17:51.160 --> 01:17:53.800
it doesn't look nice. You'll be bored stiff.

01:17:53.960 --> 01:17:56.160
I mean people get bored stiff I tell you

01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.000
when I've seen these people when they come to India

01:17:58.200 --> 01:17:58.960
they want to go to villages

01:17:59.160 --> 01:18:02.560
because in the city they said there are many white skin people.

01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:05.520
You want to see something else than this.

01:18:05.720 --> 01:18:09.640
This variety is an important of the beauty that God has created

01:18:09.840 --> 01:18:12.240
out of which if you think the white skin is higher.

01:18:12.440 --> 01:18:15.600
Tomorrow the black skin people will say the black skin is higher.

01:18:15.800 --> 01:18:16.480
Possibly.

01:18:19.320 --> 01:18:21.640
But the another thing is working out is this

01:18:21.840 --> 01:18:24.720
very subtle which you do not understand.

01:18:24.920 --> 01:18:27.120
The people whom you have aggressed are

01:18:27.320 --> 01:18:30.120
crawling into your young people.

01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:32.640
They are the one who are aggressing you now

01:18:32.840 --> 01:18:35.440
as gurus

01:18:35.640 --> 01:18:40.960
draining out your money in a very subtle way.

01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:43.560
They are dominating all your young generation

01:18:43.760 --> 01:18:46.400
which is tomorrow's nation.

01:18:46.600 --> 01:18:50.200
They are giving them drugs and things and they are just making them

01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:52.040
into cabbages

01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:53.800
a very subtle way

01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.880
because they are left sided people they know how to do it.

01:18:58.200 --> 01:19:01.080
The aggression is not apparent. The aggression is at least better

01:19:01.280 --> 01:19:03.720
better that you can see it apparently

01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:09.400
but this is a very subtle aggression that is crawling in.

01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:12.960
And it's going into your minds working here,

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:18.640
and you are losing contact with yourself.

01:19:18.840 --> 01:19:23.680
Every action has a reaction but this reaction is very wrong for me

01:19:23.880 --> 01:19:27.000
because I have come at a time when thousands of my

01:19:27.200 --> 01:19:29.800
children, the seekers of God have been born.

01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:32.600
This is the time when they have to got their realization

01:19:32.800 --> 01:19:38.360
and at this time these people are so powerful because

01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:40.720
of your fear now.

01:19:40.920 --> 01:19:43.040
The person who aggresses also has a fear.

01:19:43.240 --> 01:19:45.880
The children might develop a fear that we should not aggress.

01:19:46.080 --> 01:19:51.360
And they become so mild that they take aggression from others.

01:19:51.880 --> 01:19:53.760
And that's what is happening to your children

01:19:53.960 --> 01:19:56.280
when your grandparents aggressed others.

01:19:56.480 --> 01:19:59.680
They now want to take all the aggression from the other.

01:19:59.880 --> 01:20:01.480
That is also a wrong thing.

01:20:01.720 --> 01:20:06.840
So this is what is happening to our society today.

01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.640
I would say to sum it

01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:13.680
we'll say that the people in the West

01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:17.400
are committing a sin against the Mother

01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:21.080
and in the East in India against the Father.

01:20:21.280 --> 01:20:25.960
And how they commit that I'll tell you in the third center.

01:20:26.160 --> 01:20:29.760
The third center is of the seeking.

01:20:29.960 --> 01:20:33.760
The third center that belongs to the seeking

01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:35.560
a very important one

01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:39.520
because it gives you seeking in all kinds of things.

01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.080
Money

01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.880
power

01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080
love

01:20:46.040 --> 01:20:50.320
and ultimately God.

01:20:50.520 --> 01:20:55.680
Now when you are going against

01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:58.440
the current of a [UNCLEAR]

01:20:58.640 --> 01:21:00.720
sideways if you are moving

01:21:00.920 --> 01:21:04.120
then the problems are created.

01:21:04.320 --> 01:21:08.480
That people who are seeking power outside

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:12.600
must know that the power lies within yourself.

01:21:12.800 --> 01:21:14.840
As I told someone the other day

01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:18.480
that I am the greatest capitalist and the greatest communist

01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.440
because I have all the powers within Myself

01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:25.960
and I cannot live without sharing it with others.

01:21:26.160 --> 01:21:27.960
I am a very happily married woman.

01:21:28.160 --> 01:21:29.760
I have a very nice family.

01:21:29.960 --> 01:21:31.240
Everything I have in life

01:21:31.440 --> 01:21:35.600
that one could think to be a very successfully married woman.

01:21:35.800 --> 01:21:37.920
That's what I am.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.360
But I can't

01:21:40.560 --> 01:21:46.320
enjoy anything without sharing this inner joy with you all.

01:21:46.520 --> 01:21:51.120
This is the real politics of God.

01:21:51.320 --> 01:21:56.040
Not an artificial politics where we believe

01:21:56.240 --> 01:22:00.040
in communism, but in heart we are capitalist.

01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:04.120
And while we believe in capitalism, in heart we are communist.

01:22:04.320 --> 01:22:05.880
We are suffering because of that.

01:22:06.080 --> 01:22:07.200
There's no integration.

01:22:07.400 --> 01:22:09.960
All this what you see artificially

01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:12.960
is all real there because whatever is artificial

01:22:13.160 --> 01:22:16.120
comes from some real source.

01:22:16.320 --> 01:22:19.360
If there is one artificial flower means there are

01:22:19.560 --> 01:22:21.640
real flowers and

01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:24.320
you can create many artificial flowers

01:22:24.520 --> 01:22:27.360
but it has to have some background.

01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:32.600
All these ideas that human beings have about economics also

01:22:32.800 --> 01:22:37.040
is very artificial to possess things

01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:39.520
to possess many things.

01:22:39.720 --> 01:22:44.960
To possess human beings also is there, possessiveness.

01:22:46.080 --> 01:22:49.880
But you must know possession is the greatest headache.

01:22:50.080 --> 01:22:51.680
Logically you can understand.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:55.240
I don't possess this instrument, thank God.

01:22:55.440 --> 01:22:58.560
So I'm not worried about it. I'm using it nicely

01:22:58.760 --> 01:23:00.800
because it is higher or whatever it is.

01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.920
It's not mine. I am not to be [UNCLEAR].

01:23:03.120 --> 01:23:04.760
Otherwise I'll have to insure it.

01:23:04.960 --> 01:23:07.600
I'll have to look after it. Big headache.

01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:09.960
It's better to see other people,

01:23:10.160 --> 01:23:12.480
other people's palaces than to have for yourself.

01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:13.760
It's a headache you see.

01:23:13.960 --> 01:23:15.920
The owner of the palace if you go and see

01:23:16.120 --> 01:23:19.280
has all the wrinkles which you can count one by one.

01:23:19.480 --> 01:23:22.560
A very sad man sitting there miserable

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:25.000
and they point it out he's the owner of this palace

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.800
while others who are seeing it are enjoying it

01:23:26.960 --> 01:23:28.720
and the fellow is sitting miserable

01:23:28.920 --> 01:23:30.200
because he has problems of duty

01:23:30.400 --> 01:23:32.080
he has problem of income tax,

01:23:32.280 --> 01:23:36.160
he has problem of how to maintain it.

01:23:36.360 --> 01:23:38.880
But you don't possess anything. It's a myth.

01:23:39.080 --> 01:23:41.080
It's a myth.

01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:42.600
We don't take anything with us.

01:23:42.800 --> 01:23:46.840
Only we take our realization.

01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:50.040
But it's not a mental thing, that I can tell you.

01:23:50.240 --> 01:23:53.880
You cannot detach yourself for any one of these things

01:23:54.080 --> 01:23:55.880
unless and until you get your realization

01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:59.240
because attachment is there

01:23:59.440 --> 01:24:01.280
as a result of ignorance.

01:24:01.480 --> 01:24:03.560
Unless and until there is light

01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:05.440
you cannot give up.

01:24:05.640 --> 01:24:08.240
Mentally you cannot do it.

01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:11.880
But the possessiveness on India is that

01:24:12.080 --> 01:24:16.400
they think they should somehow hook or crook make money.

01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:19.160
Not all, but many.

01:24:19.360 --> 01:24:22.680
At least the people at the helm of affairs feel like that.

01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:25.640
That means they have no faith in God.

01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:29.800
Shri Krishna has said, "Yogakshemam vahamyaham."

01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:31.760
When you will get your yoga

01:24:31.960 --> 01:24:33.160
when you'll get your union

01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:36.680
I'll look after your kshema, means your wellbeing.

01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:38.960
Shri Krishna was in India

01:24:39.160 --> 01:24:41.520
and this is what India believe in.

01:24:41.720 --> 01:24:44.680
When God is going to look after us when we get yoga,

01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:48.600
why not get to yoga straightforward?

01:24:48.800 --> 01:24:52.560
I could understand that we had to fight for our freedom.

01:24:52.760 --> 01:24:53.520
That's all right.

01:24:53.720 --> 01:24:55.640
But after that fight

01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.760
now what do you have to have is yoga.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.280
First take to your yoga and He looks after you

01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:04.440
because this is the principle of wealth also

01:25:04.640 --> 01:25:07.880
of your wellbeing.

01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:10.080
Those who come to Sahaja Yoga

01:25:10.280 --> 01:25:12.960
somehow get their debts paid.

01:25:13.200 --> 01:25:16.120
They get out of all the financial entanglements.

01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:18.560
They get sufficient money to live well

01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:23.040
but not too much because that's an extreme.

01:25:23.240 --> 01:25:24.680
They live gloriously.

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.600
They become generous people.

01:25:27.800 --> 01:25:31.720
Despite affluence I find people have no sense of generosity.

01:25:31.920 --> 01:25:32.880
They are saving money.

01:25:33.080 --> 01:25:35.240
Morning till evening saving so many pounds.

01:25:35.440 --> 01:25:36.960
Spend so much save so much.

01:25:37.160 --> 01:25:38.720
The advertisement goes like that.

01:25:38.920 --> 01:25:41.000
We spend so much and you save so much,

01:25:41.200 --> 01:25:43.520
and people are looking out for us how they can save money.

01:25:43.720 --> 01:25:46.240
Save for what?

01:25:46.440 --> 01:25:47.200
For what?

01:25:47.400 --> 01:25:50.440
To go to a pub?

01:25:50.640 --> 01:25:53.200
We have strikes, things like that.

01:25:53.400 --> 01:25:56.200
Australia is another one very much interested

01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:58.120
by this strikes business.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.040
We are suffering because of that.

01:26:00.240 --> 01:26:01.960
I can see that clearly.

01:26:02.160 --> 01:26:04.360
That's happening in England also same thing.

01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:05.520
The reason is

01:26:05.720 --> 01:26:07.600
you do not know why you want to save money

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:09.160
why do you want to have more money.

01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:12.240
Is this bottomless pit

01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:17.560
which you have to fill with alcohol.

01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:21.920
Alcohol is the curse of the West.

01:26:22.120 --> 01:26:24.200
That is the curse of the West.

01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:26.160
But human nature is so funny

01:26:26.360 --> 01:26:28.640
that they see a man falling down on the ground

01:26:28.840 --> 01:26:30.560
and enter into the same pub

01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:32.560
to come back and fall on the other side.

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:36.720
Perhaps they think the other side is missing so let's fill it up.

01:26:36.880 --> 01:26:38.760
It's so stupid to see.

01:26:38.960 --> 01:26:41.400
I mean I was living in a place near the church.

01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:45.080
to be the biggest church of England

01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:46.600
in Catholic Church

01:26:46.800 --> 01:26:52.320
and the only activity I saw there in the morning was

01:26:52.520 --> 01:26:53.640
the

01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:58.720
beer. Big, big barrels of beer coming in

01:26:58.920 --> 01:27:01.000
and empty ones going out. That's all.

01:27:01.200 --> 01:27:03.280
No other entry no other exit.

01:27:03.480 --> 01:27:05.640
Only that much.

01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:08.080
From the back side from the sideways

01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:10.280
I saw this was the only thing going on

01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:15.280
and these priests are supposed to be godly people.

01:27:15.480 --> 01:27:17.680
It is so absurd you can't imagine.

01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.880
In Russia I went and they took me

01:27:20.080 --> 01:27:26.160
to a church. You see they had a Church of Orthodox.

01:27:26.360 --> 01:27:29.320
You too have here. I've seen Orthodox Church.

01:27:29.520 --> 01:27:32.080
And the fellow of the head of the church

01:27:32.280 --> 01:27:36.520
us that today that this is our fasting day so we can't eat meat

01:27:36.720 --> 01:27:38.400
but he drank so much

01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.800
that he become a drunk, you see.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.040
And we didn't know where to look.

01:27:43.240 --> 01:27:44.840
He got drunk completely.

01:27:45.040 --> 01:27:47.640
He was supposed to see us out because we are VIP's

01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.120
and there were three officers and then they started laughing.

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:52.920
They said, "This is what Christianity is."

01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.600
I said "Why, why this?"

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:56.120
He said, "You know what happend

01:27:56.320 --> 01:27:58.520
that Russians thought that they must also have a religion,

01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.640
after all everybody has a religion."

01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.680
They sent for someone.

01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:04.800
So the Muslims came in and they said,

01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.480
In Islam you can marry four times

01:28:08.680 --> 01:28:10.640
but you cannot have alcohol."

01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:12.720
They said, "This won't work out for such Russians.

01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:14.040
This is all right go out."

01:28:14.240 --> 01:28:16.640
So then they said, "Let's call Catholics."

01:28:16.800 --> 01:28:18.600
So they called Catholics

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:23.280
and the Catholics said that, "You can

01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.720
have alcohol quite all right as much as you like."

01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:29.320
I don't know why they got this idea that they can have alcohol.

01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.160
[aside]

01:28:38.720 --> 01:28:45.200
"You must take a vow

01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.960
that you will not marry another woman,

01:28:48.160 --> 01:28:52.040
and that there is no divorce." They said, "This won't work out."

01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.120
But Orthodox Church was like our gurus.

01:28:55.320 --> 01:28:56.920
Said, "Do what you like.

01:28:57.120 --> 01:29:00.680
We are not bothered as long as you give your purse to us."

01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.760
And that's how Orthodox Church came. Can you believe it?

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:07.960
This is the plight of the churches, of the temples now.

01:29:08.160 --> 01:29:10.080
I asked a little boy who

01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:12.040
was taking drugs, a Western boy.

01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:13.360
I said, "From where do you get?"

01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:14.600
He said, "From the temples of India."

01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:17.160
Can you imagine the temples.

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:20.480
While you people think that all that is Indian is great, you see.

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:23.320
Temples are great.

01:29:23.520 --> 01:29:26.720
Even lamas are another institution by themselves.

01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:29.960
You think lamas are great people. We had a big

01:29:30.200 --> 01:29:31.640
argument on that.

01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:34.720
These lamas extracted blood out of that Tibet.

01:29:34.920 --> 01:29:35.840
You won't believe.

01:29:36.040 --> 01:29:38.600
If you see a Tibetan he's just

01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:41.840
any blood, without any flesh in him.

01:29:42.040 --> 01:29:44.520
And these people lived in big [GLASS?] place

01:29:44.720 --> 01:29:47.640
you see with the golden cups

01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:49.840
with golden plates.

01:29:50.040 --> 01:29:53.040
And one of them came to Sweden and he told these people that,

01:29:53.240 --> 01:29:56.960
"If I come I must have a marble floor."

01:29:57.200 --> 01:30:00.160
What was he going to do with a marble floor? God only knows.

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.920
Poor things. They starved themselves.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:04.040
These young people don't have so much money in the West.

01:30:04.240 --> 01:30:07.120
And made a marble floor for this great man to come in.

01:30:07.320 --> 01:30:09.640
He would sit seven feet high

01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.600
and what did he do there

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:15.040
is to go just to bow 1001 times on that

01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:20.840
cold marble while they're sitting nicely on a very cozy place.

01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.160
And they got all kinds of diseases as with that.

01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:30.960
This is what it is. This is so called [UNCLEAR].

01:30:31.200 --> 01:30:34.160
Now one has to understand

01:30:34.360 --> 01:30:38.280
that religion is for your balance.

01:30:38.480 --> 01:30:42.920
Balance is for your ascent.

01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:47.920
And the ascent is the one you have to achieve.

01:30:48.120 --> 01:30:51.520
And if you cannot achieve your ascent

01:30:51.720 --> 01:30:56.600
through any method then you give it up completely

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:59.960
because it would be something like

01:31:00.200 --> 01:31:01.880
not arriving at a point

01:31:02.080 --> 01:31:04.240
nor completing what you are.

01:31:04.440 --> 01:31:08.040
You are not complete unless and until you become the Spirit.

01:31:08.240 --> 01:31:11.680
And this is the biggest problem today is to bring to people

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:14.200
this simple fact. It's very simple

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:18.040
that Spirit is within you and can be enlightened

01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:20.040
spontaneously

01:31:20.240 --> 01:31:23.040
without any effort

01:31:23.240 --> 01:31:26.760
without reading about it because it's so [WHITE OR WIDE?].

01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:32.560
Just like your own heart beating.

01:31:32.760 --> 01:31:36.840
You cannot believe in a person who can be genuinely [BENEFACTOR?].

01:31:37.040 --> 01:31:38.880
Even some of them said, "Must be suspicious.

01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:43.360
She doesn't take any money." They can't believe it.

01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:47.040
How can I charge for my love?

01:31:47.240 --> 01:31:51.120
What can you pay?

01:31:51.320 --> 01:31:54.080
Can you value it in money?

01:31:54.280 --> 01:31:57.360
Can you imagine it in anything that exists?

01:31:57.560 --> 01:31:59.680
This joy is boundless.

01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:01.960
Is your own.

01:32:02.200 --> 01:32:03.800
Is just waiting

01:32:03.960 --> 01:32:06.680
to open its door. The flood

01:32:06.880 --> 01:32:09.520
of that joy is going to come into your life.

01:32:09.720 --> 01:32:14.640
But once you have got realization as Dr. Warren has said,

01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:17.320
"Be careful that you establish yourself."

01:32:17.520 --> 01:32:20.560
Individually every person can give realization

01:32:20.760 --> 01:32:24.200
to thousands. There's one Indian who's just a farmer

01:32:24.400 --> 01:32:27.200
has given realization to at least to ten thousand people

01:32:27.400 --> 01:32:30.520
whom I never met before.

01:32:30.720 --> 01:32:33.080
Of course he can't give en masse

01:32:33.280 --> 01:32:36.480
but still from one to another to another to another like that

01:32:36.680 --> 01:32:40.360
he has given ten thousand people,

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.840
and he's a miraculous man.

01:32:43.040 --> 01:32:46.440
It is very easy to mock at these things and to make fun of this.

01:32:46.640 --> 01:32:50.520
It's a sign of superficiality.

01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:52.120
You are great.

01:32:52.320 --> 01:32:54.080
You are fantastic.

01:32:54.280 --> 01:32:56.080
I'm requesting you as a mother

01:32:56.280 --> 01:32:57.920
that just recognize yourself.

01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:00.240
Have your self esteem

01:33:00.440 --> 01:33:02.320
and don't worry as to what I've said.

01:33:02.520 --> 01:33:05.480
Whatever you have done is all forgiven once for all.

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:09.080
At this moment you have to be absolutely

01:33:09.280 --> 01:33:13.400
beautifully placed as the most innocent people ever [UNCLEAR].

01:33:13.600 --> 01:33:14.960
No guilt of any kind.

01:33:15.160 --> 01:33:16.360
No guilt at all.

01:33:16.560 --> 01:33:19.800
Yesterday some people came there. Later I suffered here.

01:33:19.960 --> 01:33:21.880
I got the pain here.

01:33:22.080 --> 01:33:24.440
I suffered so much with this idea of guilt.

01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.800
Is all your own mental projection.

01:33:27.000 --> 01:33:30.080
So without any guilt you are going to get your realization today.

01:33:30.280 --> 01:33:32.080
I hope it works out with all of you.

01:33:32.280 --> 01:33:34.280
If it does not - tomorrow, day after.

01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.720
I'm going to tell you about the other chakras

01:33:38.920 --> 01:33:43.920
tomorrow and then about realization, about the Spirit.

01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:48.240
Then we want to have a

01:33:48.440 --> 01:33:51.240
as they call it which is a very funny word I find

01:33:51.480 --> 01:33:54.160
workshop as if you are all machines and I have

01:33:54.360 --> 01:33:58.800
to do some hammer to make your heads.

01:33:58.960 --> 01:34:01.720
But I've seen it's a blossom time

01:34:01.920 --> 01:34:04.400
and some gardening we are going to do.

01:34:04.600 --> 01:34:08.040
And we are going to invite you to some place on Sunday.

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:10.120
Come and have lunch with us

01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:12.160
and we'll have very relaxed time

01:34:12.360 --> 01:34:14.920
and we'll enjoy this [FEELING or BEING?] within us.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:19.080
May God bless you.

01:34:22.800 --> 01:34:25.640
Unnecessary waste of time.

01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:28.640
We'll just

01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:33.720
have the realization.

01:35:04.240 --> 01:35:06.240
Now a very simple thing has to be done.

01:35:06.440 --> 01:35:10.080
Just take out your shoes

01:35:10.280 --> 01:35:14.720
because the Mother Earth is going to help us. Just take out.

01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:19.960
Also take out your spectacles because your eyesight might be helped.

01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.640
As I said before not feel guilty at all.

01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.440
Not at all guilty.

01:35:27.640 --> 01:35:30.440
First of all before closing your eyes you have to tell yourself,

01:35:30.640 --> 01:35:32.440
"I am not at all guilty."

01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:34.960
Thrice you must tell yourself assertively that,

01:35:35.160 --> 01:35:38.400
"Mother I am not at all guilty

01:35:38.600 --> 01:35:40.400
of anything."

01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:42.760
Because I am talking of God

01:35:42.960 --> 01:35:48.320
who is so anxious to give you this.

01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:52.640
Who is the ocean of love.

01:35:54.040 --> 01:35:58.600
Who is the ocean of forgiveness.

01:36:04.280 --> 01:36:06.960
You should sit with relaxed mind.

01:36:07.160 --> 01:36:10.200
Put your hands towards Me just like this.

01:36:10.400 --> 01:36:16.200
Simple way like this just put on your lap.

01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:20.200
Just like that.

01:36:20.400 --> 01:36:22.680
You can keep it on the ground. [UNCLEAR].

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:27.240
You can keep it here, down below. Yes.

01:36:27.440 --> 01:36:29.320
Be comfortable.

01:36:29.520 --> 01:36:31.600
Be comfortable if you have a

01:36:31.800 --> 01:36:34.840
very strong on your neck you can little bit reduce it

01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:38.760
if it is tightening or in any way hot for you.

01:36:38.960 --> 01:36:40.040
Anything

01:36:40.240 --> 01:36:45.600
whichever thing which way you are comfortable is the best way.

01:36:45.800 --> 01:36:49.400
You.

01:36:49.600 --> 01:36:53.280
Now with a cheerful mind you have to [LISTEN TO ME

01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:56.200
Not to be angry with yourself.

01:36:56.400 --> 01:36:59.880
In no way be angry with yourself.

01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:04.160
So put both the hands

01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:07.400
on your lap and close your eyes.

01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.240
Just close your eyes.

01:37:15.680 --> 01:37:21.040
So as a result of the kundalini awakening

01:37:21.240 --> 01:37:22.760
what happens

01:37:22.960 --> 01:37:24.560
that first of all that you start

01:37:24.760 --> 01:37:28.520
feeling the cool breeze coming out of your head. Is

01:37:28.720 --> 01:37:30.720
Is the real baptism.

01:37:30.920 --> 01:37:32.760
That's the first thing that should happen

01:37:32.960 --> 01:37:37.040
that the cool breeze starts coming out of your head.

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.320
Please don't open your eyes.

01:37:39.560 --> 01:37:42.280
Please just don't open your eyes

01:37:42.480 --> 01:37:43.880
because if you open your eyes

01:37:44.080 --> 01:37:46.400
kundalini won't rise above Agnya Chakra.

01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:49.160
So just keep your eyes shut.

01:37:49.360 --> 01:37:51.720
It will help a lot.

01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:53.680
Not to bend your neck too much

01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:56.680
to put back, but be straight.

01:37:56.880 --> 01:37:59.640
Be straight and parallel. Be comfortable.

01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.040
Put both the hands straight on the Mother Earth

01:38:02.240 --> 01:38:06.880
away from each other. Not touching each other.

01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:32.520
Now the first center that I told you about

01:38:32.720 --> 01:38:38.200
is the center of your chastity of your wisdom.

01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:42.320
So you have to say, "Mother please

01:38:42.520 --> 01:38:45.320
awaken the innocence within me."

01:38:45.520 --> 01:38:51.240
Just to say that because this is your right.

01:38:51.440 --> 01:38:54.480
cannot force you.

01:38:54.680 --> 01:38:57.600
You have to ask. This is your freedom.

01:38:57.800 --> 01:39:01.080
If you do not want it I cannot do it.

01:39:01.280 --> 01:39:08.720
You have to ask that, "Please awaken my innocence within me

01:39:08.920 --> 01:39:13.280
and my desire to be one

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:19.560
with the Divine should be intense."

01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:38.840
"Please awaken my kundalini,

01:39:39.040 --> 01:39:43.320
this desire within me,

01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:55.880
and make me that all the technique of Divine love."

01:39:56.080 --> 01:40:00.920
That is called as shuddha vidya is the pure knowledge

01:40:01.120 --> 01:40:03.880
of the technique.

01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:10.600
You have to ask. That's the problem is

01:40:10.800 --> 01:40:14.320
because human beings have been given something

01:40:14.520 --> 01:40:17.640
which cannot be taken away.

01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:23.920
Not to feel guilty at all

01:40:24.120 --> 01:40:25.480
is again I said every time

01:40:25.680 --> 01:40:29.000
don't feel guilty.

01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:31.040
Don't say how can I do it. What will -

01:40:31.240 --> 01:40:32.800
It's all within you. It's just waiting.

01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.720
The whole instrument is there.

01:40:34.920 --> 01:40:38.280
Just I have to connect it. You just help me.

01:40:44.240 --> 01:40:45.960
By not feeling guilty at all

01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:49.280
because your guilt has no meaning at all

01:40:49.480 --> 01:40:53.320
to the ocean of love

01:40:53.520 --> 01:40:56.040
it's not even a speck. It can be washed off in no time

01:40:56.240 --> 01:40:59.840
so you just don't stick onto your guilt.

01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:18.720
Now left hand is your power of desire

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:24.240
and right hand is your power of action.

01:41:24.440 --> 01:41:27.280
So keep the left hand as it is towards Me

01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:29.680
so the desire is steadied there

01:41:29.880 --> 01:41:35.960
and use the right hand first of all on your heart.

01:41:36.280 --> 01:41:39.720
Put your right hand on the heart.

01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:41.480
In the heart resides

01:41:41.680 --> 01:41:45.720
the Spirit, the reflection of God Almighty.

01:41:45.920 --> 01:41:51.520
So you have to say, "Mother make me the Spirit."

01:42:01.560 --> 01:42:04.280
Now you have to become the master.

01:42:04.480 --> 01:42:07.320
Master of all these trigunas,

01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:09.280
the three powers I've told you.

01:42:09.480 --> 01:42:11.320
Like you have got in a car

01:42:11.520 --> 01:42:13.320
the break and accelerator.

01:42:13.520 --> 01:42:16.120
You have these three powers within you

01:42:16.320 --> 01:42:18.600
by which

01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:21.680
you first of all you make mistakes these two powers

01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:24.160
and then you become the third power

01:42:24.360 --> 01:42:27.720
which is the automatic driving power.

01:42:27.920 --> 01:42:29.400
You learn it.

01:42:29.600 --> 01:42:34.800
Just becomes part and parcel of you. Don't think about it.

01:42:34.960 --> 01:42:39.640
And then the master is sitting behind the car.

01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:41.440
You become that.

01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:45.680
When you become the master you start seeing the driver in you

01:42:45.880 --> 01:42:47.880
you and all these powers within you

01:42:48.080 --> 01:42:49.880
and handle them

01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:53.800
just like a master handles his own vehicle

01:42:53.960 --> 01:42:57.040
you handle it and you just don't get into tantrums and

01:42:57.240 --> 01:43:00.040
you do all kinds of things which are not

01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:02.160
within your reach within your control.

01:43:02.360 --> 01:43:04.240
That's how you become the master.

01:43:04.440 --> 01:43:06.840
So to become the master you put your right hand

01:43:07.040 --> 01:43:09.880
your stomach on the left hand side.

01:43:10.080 --> 01:43:12.960
Right hand

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.720
on the left hand side of your stomach.

01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:20.600
Right hand on the left hand side of your stomach.

01:43:20.800 --> 01:43:24.120
Right hand on the left hand side of your stomach

01:43:24.320 --> 01:43:28.040
left hand towards Me.

01:43:33.320 --> 01:43:40.960
Now you have to say, "Mother make me my own master."

01:43:41.160 --> 01:43:44.400
Say it thrice.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:02.480
Then

01:44:02.680 --> 01:44:05.440
now you have to say, "Mother I am my own master."

01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:07.800
Put your left hand towards Me please.

01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:11.920
Left hand should be towards Me, yes.

01:44:12.120 --> 01:44:15.160
Open, open. Not closed hand.

01:44:15.360 --> 01:44:17.600
Now say, "Mother make me my own master."

01:44:17.800 --> 01:44:19.360
You have to be your own master.

01:44:19.560 --> 01:44:22.560
You are not to be guided by any master or anyone.

01:44:22.760 --> 01:44:26.600
It's your Spirit which is going to guide you.

01:44:39.640 --> 01:44:44.840
Just say ten times, "I am my own master."

01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:15.880
Now raise the same hand

01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:20.520
higher to the Spirit to your heart

01:45:20.720 --> 01:45:26.440
and now say 10 times, "Mother I am the Spirit."

01:45:29.440 --> 01:45:30.360
Ten times.

01:45:30.560 --> 01:45:33.520
Just right hand. Don't move left hand. Only move right hand.

01:45:33.720 --> 01:45:36.120
Left hand you keep all the time stretched.

01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:39.160
hand you move to the heart and say ten times,

01:45:39.360 --> 01:45:44.040
"Mother I am the Spirit."

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:55.760
Now.

01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:11.560
Put the right hand on the left hand side of your neck.

01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:15.040
Left hand side of your neck on the Vishuddhi Chakra.

01:46:15.240 --> 01:46:16.320
The Left Vishuddhi.

01:46:16.520 --> 01:46:20.840
We are working on the left throughout.

01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:24.400
So you say, "Mother

01:46:24.600 --> 01:46:26.120
I am not guilty."

01:46:26.320 --> 01:46:31.960
sixteen times as a punishment.

01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:54.520
Just say, "Mother I am not guilty."

01:47:02.720 --> 01:47:06.760
Sixteen times.

01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:11.360
This will cure lots of your problems

01:47:11.560 --> 01:47:15.800
of guilt, of diffidence.

01:47:22.840 --> 01:47:25.760
You cannot be guilty because you are the Spirit.

01:47:25.960 --> 01:47:28.000
The Spirit cannot be guilty.

01:47:36.440 --> 01:47:37.920
Now put your right hand again.

01:47:38.120 --> 01:47:42.920
Left hand being there where it is. On your forehead across.

01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:46.520
On your forehead across

01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:49.920
at the center of our Lord Jesus Christ

01:47:50.120 --> 01:47:55.560
and say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:47:55.760 --> 01:48:01.720
With your full heart you should say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:48:09.960 --> 01:48:13.760
Because if you don't forgive you are working under a myth

01:48:13.960 --> 01:48:16.520
because you are not troubling the person.

01:48:16.720 --> 01:48:18.800
The person is troubling you.

01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:23.200
Just say, "Mother I forgive everyone."

01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:26.040
Some people say it is difficult. It is the easiest thing.

01:48:26.240 --> 01:48:32.160
Just your mental projection it is.

01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:59.040
Now put this right hand on top of your head.

01:48:59.240 --> 01:49:01.160
You'll find it's little hot.

01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:02.800
The heat is coming out of your body.

01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:07.320
Just put it on top of your head. Head.

01:49:07.680 --> 01:49:09.840
The heat is coming out. Press it.

01:49:10.040 --> 01:49:13.320
The palm of the hand should be pressed in the center.

01:49:13.520 --> 01:49:18.320
find there is a heat. Press it.

01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:22.360
At this point you have to have to ask for your realization again

01:49:22.560 --> 01:49:24.320
because I cannot force it on you.

01:49:24.520 --> 01:49:26.960
So you have to say, "Mother I want my realization.

01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:31.040
Please give me my realization.

01:49:37.280 --> 01:49:38.840
I'm a seeker of truth.

01:49:39.040 --> 01:49:44.160
Please give me my realization, Mother."

01:49:55.600 --> 01:50:01.640
Now raise your hand and see if there is a cool breeze coming out.

01:50:11.640 --> 01:50:14.320
You can change your hand. Put your right hand towards Me

01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:18.400
and put the left hand and see if there's a cool breeze coming out.

01:50:18.600 --> 01:50:24.640
Right hand towards Me not closed but open, open hand.

01:50:28.200 --> 01:50:30.560
[FIRST TIME?]

01:50:30.760 --> 01:50:32.960
which is doing all the living work,

01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.640
everything around us.

01:50:38.280 --> 01:50:41.600
Now put down your hands please

01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:45.720
and see if you are feeling now in your hands.

01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:50.480
Just see if you are feeling in your hands also.

01:50:50.680 --> 01:50:52.720
feel very relaxed.

01:50:52.920 --> 01:50:57.240
[COULD BRING?] peace, bliss of God

01:50:57.440 --> 01:51:02.720
and kingdom of God on this Earth.

01:51:10.360 --> 01:51:15.800
Please raise the hands who have felt the cool breeze in their hands

01:51:20.720 --> 01:51:23.000
All of you have felt it.

01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:25.240
That's great.

01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:28.600
Very great.

01:51:28.800 --> 01:51:30.800
So many of you have felt.

01:51:30.960 --> 01:51:34.640
May God bless you.

01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:37.880
You need not think about it.

01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:44.640
Only thing I will tell you how to fix your kundalini better

01:51:44.840 --> 01:51:48.040
because you see it's like fixing

01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:52.200
it into a plug properly otherwise it can be loose a little bit.

01:51:52.400 --> 01:51:58.160
So Warren will tell you how to do it. Just tell.

01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.760
WARREN: Just put your left hand near the kundalini at this point.

01:52:00.960 --> 01:52:02.360
SHRI MATAJI: Put the left hand

01:52:02.560 --> 01:52:05.680
towards your kundalini, little in front.

01:52:05.880 --> 01:52:08.360
WARREN: And the right hand in front

01:52:08.560 --> 01:52:11.960
and you come around in that fashion.

01:52:12.160 --> 01:52:19.160
SHRI MATAJI: First higher, forward, lower, backwards.

01:52:19.360 --> 01:52:20.360
Like that.

01:52:20.560 --> 01:52:22.720
You have to move. This is the left hand which moves steady

01:52:22.920 --> 01:52:26.120
and the right hand moves round and round like that clockwise.

01:52:26.320 --> 01:52:27.560
Now you go on moving it.

01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.640
WARREN: You raise it.

01:52:28.840 --> 01:52:31.200
SHRI MATAJI: Raise it - your kundalini. Go up.

01:52:31.400 --> 01:52:33.920
Take it up. Push back your hands.

01:52:34.120 --> 01:52:35.560
them loose.

01:52:35.760 --> 01:52:39.080
Push it up. [MAKE IT A BIT?]. Twist

01:52:39.280 --> 01:52:41.800
on top of your head

01:52:42.000 --> 01:52:45.360
and now give it a knot.

01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:48.760
This is first time. This is for the first power.

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:50.920
For the second power again

01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:55.680
put your hand in front of your kundalini but do it properly.

01:52:55.880 --> 01:53:00.800
Higher, in front, lower and backwards again.

01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.800
Start doing it. Raise it.

01:53:07.760 --> 01:53:08.800
Go high

01:53:08.960 --> 01:53:11.680
and push your back your hands

01:53:11.880 --> 01:53:15.520
and just give it a big twist again.

01:53:15.720 --> 01:53:19.360
Now for third power you have to do it thrice. Three knots.

01:53:19.560 --> 01:53:22.120
Don't put down your hands but just do it three times.

01:53:22.320 --> 01:53:23.440
Again let's do it.

01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:27.880
are raising your own kundalini.

01:53:29.720 --> 01:53:32.920
Go up again. Push back your hands. Give fast twist.

01:53:33.120 --> 01:53:35.480
Keep your hands there. Give it a knot.

01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.760
Again twist your hand

01:53:38.960 --> 01:53:41.080
and give it a knot.

01:53:41.280 --> 01:53:43.600
Again twist your hand

01:53:43.800 --> 01:53:45.840
and now give it a big knot.

01:53:46.040 --> 01:53:52.120
Now see for yourself if your hands are working better.

01:53:58.320 --> 01:54:01.440
These are the hands that are going to speak

01:54:01.640 --> 01:54:03.920
as told by Muhammad Sahab

01:54:04.120 --> 01:54:08.520
that at the time of your resurrection your hands will speak.

01:54:08.720 --> 01:54:12.320
Now you can see that in the hands he has shown the chakras,

01:54:12.520 --> 01:54:14.040
the fingertips.

01:54:14.240 --> 01:54:15.840
All these I will tell you.

01:54:16.040 --> 01:54:18.320
Today's three chakras I'll tell you where they are.

01:54:18.520 --> 01:54:21.400
Left side is left side. Right side is right side

01:54:21.600 --> 01:54:23.640
and the center side is here.

01:54:23.840 --> 01:54:25.760
And the three chakras we have.

01:54:25.960 --> 01:54:28.320
The first chakras is this one on the left hand side.

01:54:28.520 --> 01:54:30.240
This is right hand side first chakra.

01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:32.720
And the second chakra we have are these.

01:54:32.920 --> 01:54:35.440
One on the left hand side, right hand side.

01:54:35.640 --> 01:54:39.480
And the third chakra are these.

01:54:39.680 --> 01:54:41.920
Both the left hand side and right hand side.

01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:43.320
Now what you feel

01:54:43.520 --> 01:54:46.000
if there's something wrong with these chakras within yourself

01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:48.440
you will feel a little burning

01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:51.880
or maybe little numbness

01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:53.680
maybe some heaviness.

01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:57.760
What all these things indicate I'll tell you tomorrow.

01:54:57.960 --> 01:54:59.720
And on other people also you can feel

01:54:59.920 --> 01:55:01.880
but just now you don't try with other people

01:55:02.080 --> 01:55:05.640
because it's like a sprouting of a seed which is very delicate.

01:55:05.840 --> 01:55:07.480
You have to look after it.

01:55:07.680 --> 01:55:10.360
Tomorrow and day after we'll work it out.

01:55:10.560 --> 01:55:13.280
You establish yourself fully in Sahaja Yoga.

01:55:13.480 --> 01:55:18.440
You have to become a guru, a complete guru of your own.

01:55:18.640 --> 01:55:21.880
May God bless you.

01:55:34.080 --> 01:55:38.680
WARREN: As Mother said there will be a workshop on Sunday.

01:55:38.880 --> 01:55:43.160
We'll give the address tomorrow night, Friday night

01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.360
SHRI MATAJI: You tell them just now.

01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:46.880
WARREN: and you are all invited.

01:55:47.080 --> 01:55:49.400
Mother will work it out.

01:55:49.600 --> 01:55:51.640
And

01:55:51.880 --> 01:55:55.440
the whole day free because we're happy to show you

01:55:55.640 --> 01:55:58.280
all the aspects of Kundalini and the chakras.

01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:01.640
Bring your lunch along.

01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:03.480
It should be a good day.

01:56:03.680 --> 01:56:07.080
Tomorrow evening Mother will speak about the Heart Chakra,

01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:09.960
the center of security within us.

01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.320
The Vishuddhi Chakra which is the center

01:56:12.520 --> 01:56:15.760
in which we are able to witness the drama of life

01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.760
and get our self esteem.

01:56:17.960 --> 01:56:22.200
And the Agnya Chakra which is the center of Christ which relates to

01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.520
the principle of the Spirit,

01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:26.800
the quality of forgiveness.

01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:31.160
And then finally the Sahasrara Chakra which is the center

01:56:31.360 --> 01:56:36.120
which Mataji Herself has opened in this incarnation.

01:56:36.320 --> 01:56:41.640
So the two successive lectures are going to deal with those centers.

01:56:41.800 --> 01:56:44.360
Thank you very much and good evening.
