00:00:00.015 --> 00:00:04.626
Public Program. Sydney (Australia), 31 March 1981.

00:00:04.651 --> 00:00:08.687
Today is very interesting topic before us,

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:14.303
is to discuss the Vishuddhi chakra,

00:00:15.153 --> 00:00:19.952
which is placed here behind the base of the neck,

00:00:19.977 --> 00:00:23.886
and which has got sixteen petals.

00:00:23.911 --> 00:00:33.092
It manifests outside the cervical plexus

00:00:33.124 --> 00:00:39.591
in the gross for physical action.

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:46.108
As you know, for the emotional side,

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.682
you have got larynx glands

00:00:48.692 --> 00:00:56.752
and thyroid is the gland which is placed here.

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:05.940
This center, in the evolution, is of greatest importance for human beings,

00:01:05.965 --> 00:01:10.925
because this center developed its maximum growth

00:01:10.952 --> 00:01:15.280
when human beings raised their heads

00:01:15.296 --> 00:01:19.394
from animal stage to become human beings.

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:25.435
As animals, the heads were at an angle towards the ground,

00:01:25.443 --> 00:01:31.551
first it was just touching, parallel, then it was raised higher and higher.

00:01:31.576 --> 00:01:37.231
Till it came to monkey stage where it was raised slightly higher.

00:01:37.256 --> 00:01:41.423
And at the human stage only, they

00:01:41.448 --> 00:01:47.799
raised their hands pass in a straight line.

00:01:50.544 --> 00:01:53.251
Straight line was all right.

00:01:53.665 --> 00:02:01.090
In the straight line it was the balance between the superego and the ego.

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:06.319
First, there is superego in the animals

00:02:06.351 --> 00:02:09.959
when they are looked after by human beings.

00:02:09.984 --> 00:02:15.853
Animals developed certain conditionings from human beings.

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:20.356
that dog has to be looked after by human beings.

00:02:20.364 --> 00:02:28.157
Then the dogs is wont to do this or that

00:02:28.182 --> 00:02:30.444
and the conditioning starts.

00:02:31.116 --> 00:02:34.163
And when this conditioning starts in a dog,

00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:38.730
he starts developing his superego in a human way.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:45.809
But when the chimpanzee raised his head

00:02:45.846 --> 00:02:48.379
and tried to [UNCLEAR] man,

00:02:48.404 --> 00:02:51.308
first the head of the first original man

00:02:51.341 --> 00:02:53.144
was bent like this.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.078
In the Ramayana, there is a mention

00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:00.592
of such race, the missing links,

00:03:00.617 --> 00:03:06.056
where human beings were half monkeys and half human beings.

00:03:06.242 --> 00:03:10.434
That’s about eight thousand years back.

00:03:13.707 --> 00:03:17.952
Now this center was really,

00:03:18.901 --> 00:03:23.133
fully enlightened by Shri Krishna,

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:33.281
who came on this earth in the era called as Dwapara.

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:37.157
Rama was in Satya Yuga, and He came in Dwapara.

00:03:37.165 --> 00:03:40.502
That is about six thousand years back.

00:03:41.252 --> 00:03:49.900
And Shri Krishna incarnated as one of the incarnations of Shri Vishnu,

00:03:49.925 --> 00:03:54.469
who is responsible for our evolutionary process.

00:03:54.477 --> 00:03:58.654
It is only through Shri Vishnu that we evolve.

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:02.245
He is the aspect which gives us dharma.

00:04:02.271 --> 00:04:05.138
Dharma is our sustenance.

00:04:05.162 --> 00:04:10.895
Through changing our sustenances or our capacities we have evolved.

00:04:10.983 --> 00:04:16.202
Like, I can say carbon was at Mooladhara chakra.

00:04:17.513 --> 00:04:24.385
And this carbon, magnetic matter, got prana into it

00:04:25.312 --> 00:04:31.577
by which it started moving as a living thing.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.703
This living thing then grew into higher and higher awareness

00:04:37.737 --> 00:04:42.399
till it reached a stage where you were an animal.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:46.849
And then you had to become a human being.

00:04:47.095 --> 00:04:50.893
The first human beings were short people.

00:04:50.918 --> 00:04:57.541
That incarnation of the short people is called as Vamana.

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.285
Then there were people who became

00:05:02.605 --> 00:05:05.892
very conscious of the nature around

00:05:06.045 --> 00:05:10.366
and they wanted to have the mastery over the nature.

00:05:10.391 --> 00:05:14.043
They started doing all kinds of yagnyas

00:05:14.062 --> 00:05:16.198
according to the Vedas.

00:05:16.342 --> 00:05:21.265
Vedas actually worked out right hand side growth of human beings.

00:05:21.284 --> 00:05:25.374
And they developed people who were good at reciting

00:05:25.399 --> 00:05:28.504
Veda mantras and all such things

00:05:28.521 --> 00:05:32.681
that would give us mastery over the five elements.

00:05:33.891 --> 00:05:38.871
These people when they mastered the five elements, they became very ego oriented,

00:05:38.926 --> 00:05:44.201
and instead of only keeping the head in the center they started pulling it backwards.

00:05:44.476 --> 00:05:47.825
By pulling that backwards,

00:05:47.837 --> 00:05:51.360
they started developing their pituitary,

00:05:51.404 --> 00:05:55.272
and this pituitary was activated so much

00:05:55.288 --> 00:06:01.450
that they increased their heights than normal,

00:06:01.579 --> 00:06:05.602
became greedy people, started thinking about the future

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:09.609
and the idea of future started coming into the human beings.

00:06:10.377 --> 00:06:14.456
It went on till today

00:06:14.530 --> 00:06:19.135
where the people have tried to master the five elements,

00:06:19.543 --> 00:06:23.324
they have developed ego to such an extent

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:26.765
that they are extremely ego-oriented

00:06:26.797 --> 00:06:30.141
and this ego engulfs, pushes down

00:06:30.167 --> 00:06:32.564
the superego as you can see here,

00:06:32.581 --> 00:06:37.170
the ego that is over-developed can push the superego down.

00:06:37.705 --> 00:06:45.912
So then in addition to that, people like Freud said that,

00:06:46.374 --> 00:06:50.695
“Why should we allow ourselves to be conditioned to anything?”

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:55.326
It’s only the human beings who can have good conditionings

00:06:55.351 --> 00:06:57.437
and who can have bad conditionings.

00:06:57.462 --> 00:07:00.076
But, as the basic wisdom was lacking, you see,

00:07:00.101 --> 00:07:03.086
gradually we started losing the basic wisdom,

00:07:03.111 --> 00:07:06.892
and we denied all kinds of conditioning within us, by saying “What’s wrong?”,

00:07:06.902 --> 00:07:09.689
by saying “What’s wrong?”,  “What’s wrong?”.

00:07:09.714 --> 00:07:14.922
And when we went on like this, saying “What’s wrong?”, “What’s wrong?”,

00:07:15.211 --> 00:07:19.682
what happened was that our ego developed

00:07:20.281 --> 00:07:23.489
so much, that it pushed the superego.

00:07:24.243 --> 00:07:27.120
The superego was pushed to such an extent

00:07:27.145 --> 00:07:29.844
that it could not bear it anymore.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:32.836
So, in the modern times, say about

00:07:32.845 --> 00:07:36.082
fifty years back, you can say, about twenty-five years back,

00:07:36.519 --> 00:07:41.054
a new generation started showing its effects.

00:07:41.541 --> 00:07:47.153
Young generation came up and they felt that the ego is too much,

00:07:47.178 --> 00:07:50.643
we are too bound to material things.

00:07:50.915 --> 00:07:57.493
We are instead of enslaving the matter and material powers,

00:07:57.518 --> 00:07:59.973
we are enslaved by them.

00:07:59.982 --> 00:08:02.911
This realization started coming into them.

00:08:02.936 --> 00:08:06.943
Actually, it started, I should say, about sixty years back.

00:08:06.968 --> 00:08:12.714
But this grew up very well about twenty, twenty-five years back

00:08:12.739 --> 00:08:16.784
very much, or little earlier, we can say about thirty years back,

00:08:17.428 --> 00:08:21.275
when people started seeing that this ego is no good,

00:08:21.333 --> 00:08:24.848
this matter is dominating us, it is falsehood.

00:08:25.017 --> 00:08:28.178
But another thing they felt very strongly was

00:08:28.203 --> 00:08:33.371
that they are now not integrated with their heart.

00:08:33.836 --> 00:08:36.456
There was no joy in anything.

00:08:36.472 --> 00:08:40.078
They did things without any emotions, they were very emotionless,

00:08:40.103 --> 00:08:42.731
there were no feelings for anything.

00:08:43.401 --> 00:08:46.935
It grew quite a lot this feeling, till the war came in,

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.601
Hitler trying to destroy, and at that time

00:08:52.626 --> 00:08:57.374
with the incoming of Hitler, people who see the ego of Hitler

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:02.015
and they started seeing that reflection within themselves,

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:08.601
that how Hitler could destroy this world

00:09:08.625 --> 00:09:10.970
by pampering the ego of the people

00:09:10.995 --> 00:09:14.566
by saying that “You belong to a higher race” and all those things.

00:09:14.609 --> 00:09:19.985
And this gave them a big shock and this big shock

00:09:20.263 --> 00:09:24.250
made the young people of that time feel

00:09:24.275 --> 00:09:27.818
that this is not the proper way of our progress.

00:09:27.843 --> 00:09:31.783
And that’s why there is a big disparity in the old people,

00:09:31.815 --> 00:09:35.096
say who ruled India and the people who are today

00:09:35.106 --> 00:09:38.704
Indian citizens or who are young people there.

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:48.335
The whole idea of ego became very subtle.

00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:50.326
They thought it was a show off,

00:09:50.350 --> 00:09:53.641
if they over-did something, it was too formal.

00:09:53.666 --> 00:09:56.430
They believed in casual life

00:09:56.446 --> 00:10:01.761
and they wouldn’t accept anything that was over ego-oriented.

00:10:01.786 --> 00:10:04.898
But once the ego has developed too much,

00:10:04.922 --> 00:10:06.862
you cannot get out of it.

00:10:06.894 --> 00:10:10.754
The more you try to fight it, the more it will sit on you.

00:10:10.779 --> 00:10:12.391
It’s not possible.

00:10:12.416 --> 00:10:16.633
And the superego, which one suppressed, can be so suppressed

00:10:16.658 --> 00:10:21.118
that you just become nothing but superego and nothing ego.

00:10:21.143 --> 00:10:23.504
And the ego then envelops the heart.

00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.332
Because one of the auras around the heart which I will be discussing later

00:10:29.357 --> 00:10:33.941
that is also from your Swadishtana chakra.

00:10:33.968 --> 00:10:37.011
And the whole Swadishtana chakra can go round

00:10:37.036 --> 00:10:40.527
and can completely encompass your heart.

00:10:40.535 --> 00:10:44.347
And there is a dislocation between your heart and your head.

00:10:44.372 --> 00:10:46.271
There’s a disintegration.

00:10:46.296 --> 00:10:51.173
Sometimes, with shocks in life, also a person’s ego is challenged.

00:10:51.199 --> 00:10:56.418
As I was telling you that we have to be very kind to our wife and to our husband.

00:10:56.925 --> 00:11:01.263
If their ego is challenged, gradually after three four shocks,

00:11:01.287 --> 00:11:03.649
they get disintegrated.

00:11:03.674 --> 00:11:05.801
We give them diseases.

00:11:05.826 --> 00:11:07.795
We give them horrible things.

00:11:07.820 --> 00:11:11.583
We have no business to do these things. This is sinful.

00:11:11.601 --> 00:11:16.606
First of all, to marry someone with all the show and with all the things

00:11:16.631 --> 00:11:20.902
and then to make somebody unhappy because you have a ego

00:11:20.927 --> 00:11:22.893
or hurt somebody’s ego

00:11:22.918 --> 00:11:28.768
by which making that person emotionally dry.

00:11:28.793 --> 00:11:32.518
Then a society which is extremely dry develops.

00:11:32.523 --> 00:11:39.142
This dry society cannot even value the children.

00:11:39.167 --> 00:11:41.588
Matter becomes the most important thing.

00:11:41.613 --> 00:11:44.296
Material possessions become more important.

00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:48.594
Then all human relationships are ended up

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.455
and sacrificed at the altar of this ego.

00:11:53.283 --> 00:11:56.730
Well, these people, after all, are human beings,

00:11:56.755 --> 00:12:00.233
they have an emotional being within them, which suffers.

00:12:00.258 --> 00:12:03.073
So to be emotional, people take to drugs

00:12:03.098 --> 00:12:06.471
and things as I told you, to alcohols.

00:12:06.472 --> 00:12:10.419
Alcohol’s gross is much more with this kind of a society.

00:12:10.444 --> 00:12:15.519
Just to escape the tortures of ego, they become alcoholic.

00:12:15.530 --> 00:12:19.202
Once they become alcoholic, the superego starts developing.

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:21.560
It starts pushing the ego on one side and

00:12:21.585 --> 00:12:24.869
the wobbling starts and the confusion starts.

00:12:24.894 --> 00:12:32.966
This alcohol, which has been denounced by every Primordial Master,

00:12:33.094 --> 00:12:35.742
because they were supposed to look after your attention,

00:12:35.767 --> 00:12:40.427
because the attention, not only gets spoilt but your values go down.

00:12:40.699 --> 00:12:43.248
Values about human’s chastity,

00:12:43.267 --> 00:12:47.799
values about your own chastity,

00:12:47.826 --> 00:12:50.026
values about your own dignity,

00:12:50.051 --> 00:12:52.299
I mean you can do anything if you pamper this,

00:12:52.324 --> 00:12:55.038
I mean, people do such undignified things,

00:12:55.063 --> 00:12:59.121
that if you take a photograph or even a picture of such people,

00:12:59.146 --> 00:13:02.561
they would be shocked that they were behaving like this.

00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:06.417
So first of all, the dignity, the human dignity goes down,

00:13:06.481 --> 00:13:10.832
the sanctity of marriage is lost

00:13:10.841 --> 00:13:15.718
and all the values that are built up in your attention as a human being,

00:13:15.736 --> 00:13:22.845
through all great blessings of these great saints and great Prophets drops off.

00:13:22.893 --> 00:13:27.024
One by one, you start reasoning without any values for anything.

00:13:27.033 --> 00:13:30.821
You do not value anything but your ego.

00:13:30.940 --> 00:13:35.723
Even your material possessions are there to suggest your ego.

00:13:35.742 --> 00:13:39.100
That’s how a person becomes a dry personality.

00:13:39.125 --> 00:13:44.217
In these circumstances, he thinks that he must also

00:13:45.154 --> 00:13:50.979
overpower God’s powers.

00:13:51.004 --> 00:13:53.386
Sometimes such things came up,

00:13:53.396 --> 00:13:57.310
that people wanted to have powers like God.

00:13:57.319 --> 00:13:59.481
And they want to challenge God,

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:01.634
and they want to say, “There is no God.

00:14:01.658 --> 00:14:03.938
How are we to believe there is God?”

00:14:03.962 --> 00:14:06.733
Because the ego is such a blind thing

00:14:06.758 --> 00:14:15.943
that you just allow it to think about God and your relation to God.

00:14:15.968 --> 00:14:19.248
It’s such a blinding thing.

00:14:19.273 --> 00:14:21.266
It makes you sometimes so stupid.

00:14:21.291 --> 00:14:25.577
As I’ve told you, last time it was said in the seminar we had,

00:14:25.596 --> 00:14:28.890
that it really makes you absolutely stupid.

00:14:29.918 --> 00:14:32.777
Now the Vishuddhi chakra is the thing

00:14:32.793 --> 00:14:35.924
which has started the ego within us,

00:14:35.948 --> 00:14:39.966
in the sense that the superego, the conditioning that was

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.366
in a society was challenged by Shri Krishna.

00:14:46.872 --> 00:14:54.505
Shri Krishna was a man who was a witness of the play.

00:14:54.636 --> 00:14:59.113
He is the one who is the Primordial Being,

00:14:59.147 --> 00:15:03.374
in the sense He is the one who rises to meet the whole.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:05.802
He is the Virata.

00:15:06.313 --> 00:15:10.819
And this Being, Shri Krishna, is the one

00:15:10.835 --> 00:15:16.981
who taught us to witness, through Gita.

00:15:20.273 --> 00:15:25.141
Now in short, I will explain to you something about Gita.

00:15:25.166 --> 00:15:29.384
And try to understand, because it is a very subtle thing to understand Gita

00:15:29.409 --> 00:15:30.824
and to read Gita.

00:15:30.841 --> 00:15:34.834
There are – I don’t know how many criticisms of Gita written already-

00:15:34.843 --> 00:15:38.918
but nobody seems to have hit at the real points of Gita.

00:15:40.866 --> 00:15:45.029
Krishna was the incarnation of divine diplomacy,

00:15:45.045 --> 00:15:47.872
divine diplomacy.

00:15:49.191 --> 00:15:55.452
Divine diplomacy is a thing by which I also play tricks on you.

00:15:55.477 --> 00:15:59.352
Because if I cannot give you Realization,

00:15:59.362 --> 00:16:04.921
if you are too argumentative, you try to be a mediocre,

00:16:04.962 --> 00:16:08.776
then I put you into such situations

00:16:08.792 --> 00:16:11.207
that you start seeing the point

00:16:11.232 --> 00:16:14.072
that you are missing the real goal.

00:16:14.097 --> 00:16:18.501
Now Gita is nothing but a complete exposition

00:16:18.526 --> 00:16:23.559
of his talent as a diplomat.

00:16:24.212 --> 00:16:28.866
For that, one has to understand the tricks of Shri Krishna.

00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:33.206
First of all, in the very beginning, First of all, in the very beginning,

00:16:33.231 --> 00:16:36.208
in the second chapter in Gita,

00:16:36.504 --> 00:16:41.692
He says that you become a ‘sthitha pragnya’,

00:16:41.717 --> 00:16:44.225
means that you become a Realized soul,

00:16:44.250 --> 00:16:46.013
you become a ‘gnyani’,

00:16:46.029 --> 00:16:50.524
means a person whose awareness is enlightened.

00:16:50.584 --> 00:16:54.205
Of course, in India, as everywhere, there are people who think,

00:16:54.221 --> 00:16:58.511
“Gnyani is a brahmin who has read many books”.

00:16:58.606 --> 00:17:02.944
It means you should have your Realization

00:17:02.968 --> 00:17:08.553
so that your awareness is enlightened.

00:17:09.006 --> 00:17:12.345
This is first thing He said at the very outset

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:13.956
because He’s not a business man, you see.

00:17:13.958 --> 00:17:16.402
So, He says the thing that is there.

00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.508
He only tells this to Arjuna to know who He is

00:17:19.533 --> 00:17:23.020
because He is a diplomat and He knows how people were at that time,

00:17:23.045 --> 00:17:26.634
that He is not going to tell them that He is an incarnation

00:17:26.659 --> 00:17:29.638
and that He is not going to tell them what is the truth.

00:17:29.663 --> 00:17:32.063
Because if you tell them the truth, they will hit you hard,

00:17:32.088 --> 00:17:33.698
He knew this very well.

00:17:34.127 --> 00:17:37.060
So He said this to Arjuna,

00:17:37.085 --> 00:17:40.172
who is his bhakta, who is his devotee,

00:17:40.874 --> 00:17:43.907
that, “You achieve that”.

00:17:44.169 --> 00:17:48.037
But Arjuna at that time is a mediocre.

00:17:48.207 --> 00:17:51.225
He couldn’t understand, because He said

00:17:51.241 --> 00:17:56.124
that, “You are a saint, you become a witness to achieve your Self-realization.

00:17:56.149 --> 00:18:00.801
And then you go for war to kill people”.

00:18:00.826 --> 00:18:03.905
They couldn’t understand, how can that be?

00:18:04.088 --> 00:18:08.797
I should kill them before; after the witnessing, how can I kill them?

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:12.174
Even if they are cruel, even if they are wrong,

00:18:12.193 --> 00:18:16.076
I cannot do it after Realization, because after Realization,

00:18:16.092 --> 00:18:19.038
I will have to be compassionate.

00:18:19.485 --> 00:18:22.130
This is the mediocracy of Arjuna.

00:18:22.154 --> 00:18:25.608
It’s a very subtle point, I think you catch the point.

00:18:26.501 --> 00:18:29.510
So Krishna says- He understands.

00:18:29.521 --> 00:18:32.816
He immediately understands, “Oh, that diplomacy is needed now,

00:18:32.841 --> 00:18:36.001
it won’t work out to say it straightforward, much”.

00:18:37.019 --> 00:18:42.445
Like, I would say a son is sitting out

00:18:42.596 --> 00:18:47.210
of the hut trying to drive a horse cart.

00:18:48.205 --> 00:18:51.659
Now the father comes out of the hut

00:18:51.671 --> 00:18:54.760
and the son says, “This cart is not moving, how to do it?”

00:18:54.784 --> 00:18:59.455
So he said that, “At the first, bring the horse in front of the cart.

00:18:59.479 --> 00:19:02.575
Unless and until it is connected

00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:05.785
through the horse, it won’t move.”

00:19:05.876 --> 00:19:11.355
You have to get connected to the horse, that is the atma, to the Spirit.

00:19:11.380 --> 00:19:16.298
So he says that, “You are saying that I have to move the cart,

00:19:16.330 --> 00:19:20.001
and now you are asking me to move the horse.

00:19:20.017 --> 00:19:22.050
How can that be?”

00:19:22.583 --> 00:19:27.255
Then father understands that this one is not going to be handled easily.

00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:29.455
So, he plays the trick on him.

00:19:29.464 --> 00:19:32.346
He says, “All right. Let it be at the back.

00:19:32.355 --> 00:19:37.114
But you think, you believe that

00:19:37.139 --> 00:19:40.007
it is the horse which is pulling the cart.

00:19:40.008 --> 00:19:41.682
You believe it.”

00:19:42.032 --> 00:19:44.797
Now how Krishna has said it is even beautifully,

00:19:44.822 --> 00:19:46.378
more beautifully than this analogy.

00:19:46.403 --> 00:19:49.904
I gave you this analogy to see the trick of Shri Krishna.

00:19:49.928 --> 00:19:52.805
And He had to play because people are so mediocre.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:57.587
Since the six thousand years they have been believing into something nonsensical,

00:19:57.616 --> 00:20:00.419
that you will see now.

00:20:00.501 --> 00:20:05.549
He [Arjuna] said that,

00:20:05.713 --> 00:20:08.680
“If I kill people,

00:20:08.713 --> 00:20:11.470
then I will have the karmas within me.

00:20:11.495 --> 00:20:15.864
And after my Realization – how will I get my Realization?

00:20:15.889 --> 00:20:19.748
If I get my Realization, then I cannot kill.”

00:20:19.773 --> 00:20:23.084
These were his ideas about Realization.

00:20:23.109 --> 00:20:26.049
What Krishna said that,

00:20:26.081 --> 00:20:30.067
“You get your Realization, and then

00:20:30.092 --> 00:20:35.797
whatever you do is in the name, is really, fully in order to God.

00:20:36.194 --> 00:20:38.141
If you have to kill, you have to kill!

00:20:38.150 --> 00:20:41.636
You have to kill the devils; you have to kill the rakshasas.”

00:20:41.645 --> 00:20:44.760
The idea that if you kill somebody, it’s something wrong –

00:20:44.785 --> 00:20:46.540
I mean, supposing today,

00:20:46.556 --> 00:20:50.900
Hitler was to come, to spare him physically is wrong.

00:20:50.917 --> 00:20:52.801
Will you spare a snake?

00:20:52.826 --> 00:20:54.034
You will have to kill.

00:20:54.059 --> 00:20:56.756
And He said, “Nobody is killed there” and that’s a fact.

00:20:56.781 --> 00:20:57.861
Nobody dies.

00:20:57.886 --> 00:21:02.499
As I told you that the Spirits cannot be killed

00:21:02.524 --> 00:21:07.568
[unsure] this will only put them out of the stage just now.

00:21:07.935 --> 00:21:14.426
So Krishna says that, “You should first become Realized,

00:21:14.442 --> 00:21:18.509
become a witness, then you are just an instrument in the hands of God.

00:21:18.534 --> 00:21:22.600
And He uses you for what He likes, and you do whatever He says.

00:21:22.611 --> 00:21:25.009
If He says you have to kill, you have to kill.

00:21:25.018 --> 00:21:27.242
If He says don’t kill, you don’t kill.

00:21:27.267 --> 00:21:29.102
Because the power starts flowing through you.

00:21:29.127 --> 00:21:32.420
Now, your own concept of compassion is wrong.

00:21:32.428 --> 00:21:34.622
How can you be compassionate with people,

00:21:34.647 --> 00:21:37.370
that one man can destroy the whole world?

00:21:37.395 --> 00:21:41.024
Are you to be compassionate to that man? For what?

00:21:41.049 --> 00:21:44.607
The greatest compassion is to him, is to put him out.

00:21:44.989 --> 00:21:48.802
After all controls, God is watching.

00:21:48.829 --> 00:21:51.582
This is the way to stop action.

00:21:52.157 --> 00:21:54.706
That is what Krishna said.

00:21:56.338 --> 00:21:58.103
But Arjuna didn’t understand.

00:21:58.151 --> 00:22:03.033
He said, “Still, how can get rid of karmas?’,

00:22:03.058 --> 00:22:05.646
and he had those theories.

00:22:05.988 --> 00:22:08.650
How to get rid of the karma.

00:22:08.921 --> 00:22:10.711
So Krishna played a trick with him.

00:22:10.719 --> 00:22:12.568
He said, “All right” .

00:22:13.673 --> 00:22:16.007
He put a very absurd condition.

00:22:16.032 --> 00:22:20.186
This is what is the essence of diplomacy is to put an absurd condition

00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.243
and befool a person

00:22:22.395 --> 00:22:25.771
so that when he reaches a stage and understands

00:22:25.796 --> 00:22:28.139
that it’s absurd, then he gives it up.

00:22:28.155 --> 00:22:30.014
Otherwise, he will not.

00:22:30.602 --> 00:22:34.836
So, He told Arjuna that,

00:22:35.575 --> 00:22:37.902
“Very good,

00:22:38.357 --> 00:22:41.438
you do not want Realization, go ahead.

00:22:41.494 --> 00:22:43.996
You do all your karmas.

00:22:44.124 --> 00:22:48.913
And you put the fruit of the karmas at the lotus feet of the God.

00:22:48.971 --> 00:22:52.250
That’s what you do, so you won’t have any karmas upon yourself.”

00:22:52.275 --> 00:22:54.093
This is an absurd thing.

00:22:54.118 --> 00:22:58.353
Before Realization, it cannot happen. It cannot happen.

00:22:58.370 --> 00:23:02.277
Before Realization, your ego remains as it is, as you see,

00:23:02.302 --> 00:23:04.422
it is not sucked in.

00:23:04.644 --> 00:23:06.250
Subtler it will become,

00:23:06.275 --> 00:23:09.896
you’ll become very humble and very kind and this,

00:23:09.921 --> 00:23:12.495
but still the ego is there.

00:23:12.869 --> 00:23:16.196
Ego is there means, it’s a state of your mind,

00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:18.390
which is covered with ego.

00:23:18.692 --> 00:23:24.458
It has to be sucked in by the actualization and actual happening.

00:23:24.538 --> 00:23:26.592
Not just saying that, “Oh you are very humble”.

00:23:26.617 --> 00:23:29.385
Some of the egoistical people are extremely humble

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.897
because that suits them, extremely.

00:23:32.977 --> 00:23:37.448
But inside it’s the ego there.
Ego is there.

00:23:37.999 --> 00:23:40.018
Till it is sucked in, you cannot fight it,

00:23:40.027 --> 00:23:42.741
you cannot drive it out, you cannot get out of it.

00:23:42.766 --> 00:23:44.878
It has to be sucked in.

00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:47.858
To suck that ego,

00:23:47.994 --> 00:23:50.735
kundalini has to rise,
you have to get your Realization.

00:23:50.743 --> 00:23:55.270
You have to become the Self and not the ego, your identification with ego must drop.

00:23:55.302 --> 00:23:58.614
That’s only possible if you become the Spirit.

00:23:58.639 --> 00:24:02.214
But He said, “All right, doesn’t matter. What you do,

00:24:02.239 --> 00:24:06.670
is to do your karmas.
Then go on hitting the cart

00:24:06.695 --> 00:24:09.429
but put all your attention on the horse,

00:24:09.454 --> 00:24:14.721
and your cart will move”. It will never move is the point, the absurdities.

00:24:14.746 --> 00:24:18.334
So He gave such a proposition by which

00:24:18.346 --> 00:24:22.061
the horse does not move.

00:24:22.086 --> 00:24:25.246
And after some time you find, “What is it?

00:24:25.272 --> 00:24:26.536
The cart is just there.

00:24:26.561 --> 00:24:27.680
I am putting everything

00:24:27.705 --> 00:24:30.942
I am supposed to be putting everything on the horse.

00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:32.509
Nothing doing.

00:24:32.525 --> 00:24:35.075
It’s not connected. It is just there.”

00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.259
Once this confusion is reached

00:24:37.276 --> 00:24:40.358
then you take your Realization and actualization.

00:24:40.398 --> 00:24:42.018
This is the point.

00:24:42.201 --> 00:24:47.843
Unless and until this absurdity is dawned upon you,

00:24:47.852 --> 00:24:49.661
you will never accept.

00:24:50.098 --> 00:24:51.854
Because you are asking questions,

00:24:51.872 --> 00:24:54.754
“Why should you do it?” “Why should he do it?” “Why?”

00:24:54.787 --> 00:24:56.923
So He says, “All right, go ahead.”

00:24:56.931 --> 00:24:59.283
So this is the karma theory that started,

00:24:59.299 --> 00:25:04.564
that whatever karmas you do, you put at the lotus feet of God.

00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.443
So it’s a misbelief.

00:25:08.468 --> 00:25:11.969
He put you into a maya, into illusion.

00:25:12.481 --> 00:25:14.053
That was important.

00:25:14.077 --> 00:25:17.103
At that stage, it was important to put you into illusion.

00:25:17.128 --> 00:25:19.231
Because you would not accept even.

00:25:19.488 --> 00:25:22.926
See, if you have to take out the butter,

00:25:23.183 --> 00:25:26.120
you cannot do it with a straight finger, you have to make

00:25:26.123 --> 00:25:29.178
your finger bent a little, it’s like that.

00:25:30.452 --> 00:25:34.803
So, Arjuna said, “What about dharma?

00:25:34.892 --> 00:25:36.610
What about devotion to God?

00:25:36.635 --> 00:25:39.539
These are organized visions, churches,

00:25:39.564 --> 00:25:42.661
and our temples and all.
What about that?”

00:25:42.686 --> 00:25:45.450
Till that also, he was [?].

00:25:45.475 --> 00:25:48.722
He says that, “Patram pushpam phalam toyam yo me.”

00:25:48.733 --> 00:25:50.956
“Whatever is the fruit,

00:25:50.981 --> 00:25:55.158
whatever is the flower,

00:25:55.183 --> 00:25:58.440
or whatever is the water you give me, I will take it.

00:25:58.465 --> 00:26:01.928
I’ll take all that. But if you give me a flower, I’ll take it.”

00:26:01.953 --> 00:26:05.043
But by giving, He is very clever,

00:26:05.068 --> 00:26:08.045
which I don’t know if people have seen the point or not.

00:26:08.064 --> 00:26:10.525
He says, “By giving, who says

00:26:10.542 --> 00:26:15.872
at that you do ‘ananya bhakti’, emotion that is ‘ananya’.

00:26:16.321 --> 00:26:19.793
Now the word ‘ananya’ is the word,

00:26:19.818 --> 00:26:23.987
which is the real devotion: a-nanya,

00:26:24.012 --> 00:26:27.720
it means when you are not the other,

00:26:27.930 --> 00:26:30.440
when you are Realized.

00:26:30.465 --> 00:26:34.569
You can only do bhakti when you are Realized, ananya.

00:26:34.602 --> 00:26:37.906
The person who’s ananya, means the one who is not the other:

00:26:37.917 --> 00:26:42.005
you become one with God, then you do the bhakti.

00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:47.265
Very clearly, He said that, “You do ananya bhakti”.

00:26:47.290 --> 00:26:50.961
Ananya devotion, means devotion

00:26:50.985 --> 00:26:52.941
when you are not the other, when you are Realized.

00:26:52.966 --> 00:26:55.559
Before that, what’s the devotion?

00:26:55.584 --> 00:26:59.032
Very cleverly said, but nobody sees the point.

00:26:59.057 --> 00:27:00.780
I’ve been asking people;

00:27:00.789 --> 00:27:03.625
the other day a gentleman came from a cult,

00:27:03.650 --> 00:27:07.921
“What does mean Shri Rama, Shri Krishna, Shri Rama, Shri Krishna.”

00:27:07.946 --> 00:27:10.401
This is not ananya bhakti.

00:27:10.426 --> 00:27:14.683
Ananya bhakti means when there is no other,

00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.415
means you become Realized.

00:27:20.231 --> 00:27:25.411
This is the essence of this bhakti Yoga.

00:27:26.785 --> 00:27:28.715
In bhakti Yoga, He has said that,

00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.948
“You have to become one with your Spirit.”

00:27:31.973 --> 00:27:35.635
Also by saying ananya, and by karmas,

00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:37.496
Karma Yoga is also the same type,

00:27:37.521 --> 00:27:41.212
“Whatever work you do you put at the lotus feet of the Lord.”

00:27:41.237 --> 00:27:44.167
You cannot do it, absurd condition.

00:27:45.433 --> 00:27:49.434
But after Realization, what happens to you that

00:27:49.459 --> 00:27:51.223
you do not say, “I do it”.

00:27:51.248 --> 00:27:53.114
You say, “It’s moving”, “It’s coming”,

00:27:53.139 --> 00:27:56.274
“It’s rising”, “It’s starting”. “It”, third person.

00:27:57.302 --> 00:27:58.940
You just say “it”.

00:27:58.965 --> 00:28:02.215
“I am getting the kundalini”, you don’t say, never.

00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.027
“It is coming”, because you know you are not, you feel that.

00:28:05.052 --> 00:28:08.474
Because its flowing from you, you have become aware of that.

00:28:09.019 --> 00:28:12.415
You say, “It is going”, “It is coming”, “It is not coming”.

00:28:12.426 --> 00:28:15.857
You don’t say, “I am giving Realization to myself or to anybody”.

00:28:15.882 --> 00:28:18.096
Like a lady came with Me to America.

00:28:18.121 --> 00:28:21.703
And she told Me that, “Mother, You must give Realization to my son”.

00:28:21.713 --> 00:28:23.888
I said, “All right.

00:28:24.470 --> 00:28:26.598
Let him come.” He came all the way from [inaudible],

00:28:26.623 --> 00:28:29.758
and the kundalini was frozen, it wouldn’t rise.

00:28:29.783 --> 00:28:31.746
She said, “Mother please give him Realization.”

00:28:31.771 --> 00:28:34.741
I said, “You are a Realized soul. You try to treat him”.

00:28:34.766 --> 00:28:37.021
Or give him a certificate that he is a Realized soul.

00:28:37.046 --> 00:28:39.372
She said, “How can I do? He is not.

00:28:39.995 --> 00:28:41.377
And why not?

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:44.899
It’s a good idea, you are listening to my recording morning till evening, to give him Realization.

00:28:44.924 --> 00:28:47.688
You say you are Realised. Why do you say you are Realized?

00:28:47.713 --> 00:28:50.472
If I were you, I would say, “Baba you are Realized. Now get out of here”.

00:28:50.497 --> 00:28:56.295
Because I knew that  the Kundalini doesn’t rise. It’s a frozen kundalini.

00:28:56.994 --> 00:28:58.676
I said, “Why don’t you do it?”

00:28:58.701 --> 00:29:00.909
She said, “How can I?” I know she is not Realized.

00:29:00.926 --> 00:29:05.413
She doesn’t give vibrations. How can I take?” I said, “That’s what it is.”

00:29:05.438 --> 00:29:08.448
The kundalini has to rise.

00:29:08.895 --> 00:29:13.286
That means that you know it is beyond your ego.

00:29:13.401 --> 00:29:15.916
It is beyond you.

00:29:15.950 --> 00:29:18.053
You cannot do it.

00:29:19.869 --> 00:29:24.650
You must have that authority within you, then only you can do it.

00:29:24.857 --> 00:29:27.383
As long as there is authority.

00:29:27.415 --> 00:29:29.093
You are doing it, that’s why that

00:29:29.110 --> 00:29:33.619
ego means an illusion that you are doing something.

00:29:33.644 --> 00:29:35.553
Because you don’t do anything.

00:29:35.577 --> 00:29:36.555
What do you do?

00:29:36.580 --> 00:29:38.396
As I told you, all dead work.

00:29:38.412 --> 00:29:39.753
Dead to the dead.

00:29:39.778 --> 00:29:43.591
You make a chair or a staircase, “Oh you are a great man!”.

00:29:43.616 --> 00:29:46.293
So [inaudible] from the mountains, make another mountain,

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:48.950
“Oh you are a great architect”.

00:29:48.975 --> 00:29:50.747
All these are dead energies

00:29:50.772 --> 00:29:54.716
you are handling, electricity, magnetism, architecture studies.

00:29:54.732 --> 00:29:57.544
All these things are not living energies.

00:29:58.483 --> 00:30:02.406
Living energy is the synthesis energy of all the energies.

00:30:03.121 --> 00:30:06.840
It is ‘prana’ on the right-hand side.

00:30:06.865 --> 00:30:10.122
On the left-hand side is the ‘mana’,

00:30:10.147 --> 00:30:13.855
and in the center is the dharma.

00:30:13.874 --> 00:30:18.266
All these three energies are synthesized

00:30:18.291 --> 00:30:21.618
are integrated, I should say [Inaudible]

00:30:21.633 --> 00:30:23.415
...is again dead to the dead.

00:30:23.424 --> 00:30:26.530
But we can get completely integrated

00:30:26.555 --> 00:30:30.931
when the light of the Spirit comes in you,

00:30:30.933 --> 00:30:32.346
and this is the Brahma,

00:30:32.371 --> 00:30:34.519
is the one that is flowing through your hands,

00:30:34.544 --> 00:30:37.656
is the Brahma Shakti, is the Brahma.

00:30:39.885 --> 00:30:41.615
So this was about Gita.

00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:43.926
But in his childhood, what did He do?

00:30:43.951 --> 00:30:45.658
We have to understand.

00:30:45.683 --> 00:30:49.717
In his childhood, people say He just tried some things.

00:30:49.742 --> 00:30:51.765
No He was not.

00:30:51.889 --> 00:30:57.787
As I knew from my very childhood, people knew from his very childhood.

00:30:59.470 --> 00:31:01.218
He played with the Gopis

00:31:01.243 --> 00:31:03.640
when He was about four years of age, you see.

00:31:03.665 --> 00:31:05.912
There’s a guru who said, “He is Shri Krishna.

00:31:05.937 --> 00:31:07.525
That’s why he makes you naked there”.

00:31:07.550 --> 00:31:10.520
Imagine, you are four years of age, and this guru is, I think,

00:31:10.533 --> 00:31:12.283
50 years of age.

00:31:12.474 --> 00:31:14.474
Is it the same?

00:31:14.619 --> 00:31:19.488
If at four years age, like an innocent child,

00:31:19.513 --> 00:31:21.166
He just started to make them naked

00:31:21.191 --> 00:31:24.160
because He wanted to raise their Kundalini as a child.

00:31:24.185 --> 00:31:24.979
He could try.

00:31:24.995 --> 00:31:27.521
[Inaudible].

00:31:27.537 --> 00:31:29.928
He climbed on the backs of the people

00:31:29.953 --> 00:31:32.089
and made them just light,

00:31:32.185 --> 00:31:34.034
made the Kundalini rise.

00:31:34.050 --> 00:31:35.123
He does it many a time,

00:31:35.148 --> 00:31:38.100
He uses that  [Inaudible].
I think that’s the best way.

00:31:38.109 --> 00:31:40.072
And I told him, “Why don’t you do it in your village?”

00:31:40.097 --> 00:31:42.167
He said  [Inaudible].

00:31:42.184 --> 00:31:44.130
There are your feet there  [unsure].

00:31:44.147 --> 00:31:47.450
But I must do some [unclear] with the car”.

00:31:48.287 --> 00:31:52.925
So the child of four years, playing with the Gopis.

00:31:52.957 --> 00:31:58.551
When they were carrying the small pots

00:31:58.576 --> 00:32:03.455
with water on their heads,
He would break those pot.

00:32:04.678 --> 00:32:08.165
Because Ra-dha, ‘ra’ means energy,

00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:10.215
‘dha’ means the one who sustains it. Ra-dha,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.985
She is the Mahalakshmi.

00:32:12.010 --> 00:32:16.951
Radha, the one who sustains the energy.

00:32:16.975 --> 00:32:20.708
She used to have her bath in the river Yamuna,

00:32:20.728 --> 00:32:23.897
and used to vibrate the water.

00:32:24.064 --> 00:32:27.869
And the Gopis, the ladies,

00:32:27.894 --> 00:32:32.755
used to go and fill their pitchers with that water,

00:32:32.767 --> 00:32:35.335
which was a vibrated water.

00:32:35.351 --> 00:32:37.759
And He would just break that

00:32:37.776 --> 00:32:39.309
pitcher from the back,

00:32:39.318 --> 00:32:42.057
so the water would fall on the back

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:45.355
giving them Realisation;

00:32:45.380 --> 00:32:47.936
see the trick of the child.

00:32:47.968 --> 00:32:51.710
In those days, there was no [unclear] and hall,

00:32:51.718 --> 00:32:53.301
nor such good seekers,

00:32:53.325 --> 00:32:57.176
one could not talk of seeking in a village of Gokul.

00:32:57.201 --> 00:33:00.624
So He tried these tricks of breaking the pitcher,

00:33:00.649 --> 00:33:02.889
make the water fall on the back,

00:33:02.905 --> 00:33:05.827
so that the Kundalini would be able to arise.

00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:09.965
Then He has also his Gopis

00:33:09.998 --> 00:33:11.990
can go [UNCLEAR] with their hands.

00:33:11.999 --> 00:33:13.067
It’s called ra-sa.

00:33:13.075 --> 00:33:15.691
‘Ra’ means ‘energy’, ‘sa’ means ‘with’.

00:33:15.716 --> 00:33:17.280
Radha used to be there.

00:33:17.305 --> 00:33:20.080
She’s there also and she used to hold their hands,

00:33:20.105 --> 00:33:21.547
and they used to all dance

00:33:21.572 --> 00:33:23.706
and the energy is imparted to them.

00:33:23.731 --> 00:33:25.835
But She was the incarnation of the Energy

00:33:25.860 --> 00:33:27.473
and He was the incarnation

00:33:27.498 --> 00:33:29.618
of the Primordial Being. That’s different.

00:33:29.643 --> 00:33:33.354
Nowadays, you find people holding your hands

00:33:33.379 --> 00:33:36.730
and passing dead spirits. It’s horrible!

00:33:36.742 --> 00:33:39.290
It is satanic!

00:33:39.705 --> 00:33:43.311
Such a thing should never be done, it causes lots of problems.

00:33:43.327 --> 00:33:46.544
[Inaudible] especially,

00:33:46.561 --> 00:33:48.691
emotionally, it’s a horrid stuff to do like this,

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:50.516
holding hands and passing spirits.

00:33:50.541 --> 00:33:52.870
Or some sort of a man

00:33:52.895 --> 00:33:57.819
sitting in the Himalayas [inaudible].

00:33:58.676 --> 00:34:02.275
If they are Realized souls, they’ll never pass it.

00:34:02.302 --> 00:34:04.944
Because they understand [inaudible].

00:34:04.994 --> 00:34:09.085
They will never trouble you.
They’ll never possess you.

00:34:09.110 --> 00:34:13.232
Now when you understand that She was Radha,

00:34:13.257 --> 00:34:17.895
and the energy was passing through them [inaudible].

00:34:19.286 --> 00:34:21.552
And He used to play another thing, very beautiful.

00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:26.022
He used to climb over a pyramid of the boys,

00:34:26.088 --> 00:34:32.640
on top to get some butter.

00:34:33.085 --> 00:34:35.936
But the people need it. So his mother used to hang it high

00:34:35.961 --> 00:34:37.875
so that they could not reach there.

00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:40.718
He used to take a small stick and hit it

00:34:40.743 --> 00:34:44.278
and all the butter used to go on them

00:34:44.303 --> 00:34:54.496
[unsure session].

00:34:54.522 --> 00:34:58.198
First of all, standing on the top of their heads, [inaudible] Sahasrara.

00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:04.055
There was a gentleman who got his Realization in

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.325
[inaudible].

00:35:06.332 --> 00:35:19.242
[Inaudible session]

00:35:19.267 --> 00:35:22.219
He had never heard about Shri Krishna. He didn’t know all that.

00:35:22.593 --> 00:35:26.566
And before getting Realization, he went to do

00:35:26.575 --> 00:35:31.477
his subconscious areas and where he finds a very big Shri Krishna.

00:35:31.502 --> 00:35:34.503
And he described what he made

00:35:34.528 --> 00:35:38.126
like a pyramid, all these things and how he falls down.

00:35:38.128 --> 00:35:41.519
And then he saw other things also there,

00:35:41.544 --> 00:35:44.111
which you can read the book and see for yourself.

00:35:44.135 --> 00:35:48.096
But butter,

00:35:49.904 --> 00:35:52.905
Shri Krishna is very fond of butter.

00:35:52.921 --> 00:35:54.294
Why?

00:35:54.310 --> 00:35:57.370
It is at this point [Hamsa]

00:35:57.775 --> 00:36:01.436
you need butter for your Vishuddhi.

00:36:01.461 --> 00:36:04.201
If you have got sinus trouble,

00:36:04.226 --> 00:36:05.857
you heat some butter

00:36:05.865 --> 00:36:08.761
and take a dropper and pour the

00:36:08.786 --> 00:36:10.883
heated butter in the nose,

00:36:10.908 --> 00:36:14.005
regularly, for 3-4 days.

00:36:14.014 --> 00:36:15.715
Your sinus will be all right.

00:36:15.723 --> 00:36:19.011
It’s a very simple medicine.
You just try it.

00:36:19.019 --> 00:36:21.561
Your colds will be all right.

00:36:21.691 --> 00:36:26.414
Why? Because the inner membrane of the nose to our breathing

00:36:26.425 --> 00:36:30.556
becomes very, very dry,

00:36:30.567 --> 00:36:32.581
or we can say cracked.

00:36:32.606 --> 00:36:35.806
As our hands can get cracked.

00:36:36.682 --> 00:36:40.415
Now if the butter is put say, even on the soup,  [inaudible]

00:36:40.440 --> 00:36:41.708
we used to do before.

00:36:41.733 --> 00:36:44.819
Nowadays, people have become so butter-conscious,

00:36:44.831 --> 00:36:46.832
that they don’t put it.

00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:49.128
On the soup, you see, the butter on the soup,

00:36:49.153 --> 00:36:52.989
just goes and lines up the trachea,

00:36:53.014 --> 00:36:57.976
these places and the throat and these glands.

00:36:58.163 --> 00:37:00.893
Even the [inaudible] is lined up, you see,

00:37:00.918 --> 00:37:05.167
so that the whole thing becomes very much soft.

00:37:05.416 --> 00:37:12.961
Even if you have any problem, you can rub hot butter in here.

00:37:12.986 --> 00:37:15.441
Now the butter has double quality.

00:37:15.466 --> 00:37:20.605
It is a soft milk fat, plus salt.

00:37:20.621 --> 00:37:23.710
Salt is the quality of the Gurus.

00:37:23.727 --> 00:37:27.588
So the combination of Guru and the butter,

00:37:27.707 --> 00:37:31.917
as we gargle with the salt,

00:37:31.928 --> 00:37:33.747
osmosis takes place.

00:37:33.755 --> 00:37:37.392
It has a very deep significance.

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:44.774
Now this center is manifested outside,

00:37:44.799 --> 00:37:46.784
as I told you as sixteen sub-plexuses,

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:51.097
which govern our nose, eyes, throat, our neck,

00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:54.942
ears and also the outside of our eyes,

00:37:54.967 --> 00:37:58.803
the eye lids and also little muscles that control,

00:37:58.828 --> 00:38:02.974
and so many things by this one center.

00:38:03.318 --> 00:38:07.836
Sixteen are the petals also of this center,

00:38:07.861 --> 00:38:09.934
Vishuddhi chakra.

00:38:10.317 --> 00:38:14.878
Vishuddhi means without, vi-shuddhi,

00:38:14.903 --> 00:38:18.263
‘vi’ means ‘absence of’,

00:38:18.288 --> 00:38:23.355
I mean it is so ‘shuddha’, it’s so holy,

00:38:23.548 --> 00:38:26.026
that everything is absent,

00:38:26.042 --> 00:38:32.382
vi-shuddha is the meaning of this center.

00:38:32.406 --> 00:38:34.859
Means it is absolutely holy

00:38:34.884 --> 00:38:39.172
and that’s why He is a sakshi, He is a witness.

00:38:39.197 --> 00:38:42.248
He tried to break our conditionings

00:38:42.256 --> 00:38:45.148
in a different way from Freud.

00:38:45.601 --> 00:38:50.247
Our first conditioning we had, in those days,

00:38:50.299 --> 00:38:57.706
that a wife and husband relationship was too conditioned.

00:38:57.976 --> 00:39:02.242
And the wife was dominated by husband, by all family people,

00:39:02.267 --> 00:39:04.897
and they used to torture everybody.

00:39:04.921 --> 00:39:09.182
In his time, a woman was treated just like a slave

00:39:09.207 --> 00:39:10.674
in the house in those days.

00:39:10.706 --> 00:39:12.547
Somehow it worked out.

00:39:12.549 --> 00:39:16.251
Because women had to be very chaste, to be very good,

00:39:16.259 --> 00:39:21.612
but the man was dominating and it was a big family’s system that developed.

00:39:21.620 --> 00:39:25.466
And with this, people started getting strangled

00:39:25.491 --> 00:39:28.882
in that family system which had become dead.

00:39:28.898 --> 00:39:32.655
So, He wanted to [inaudible].

00:39:32.664 --> 00:39:36.748
He said that, “There is no harm

00:39:36.757 --> 00:39:40.172
in mixing with men as brothers and sisters.

00:39:40.197 --> 00:39:42.428
We have to be pure in heart

00:39:42.437 --> 00:39:45.511
and they are all brothers and sisters, we should mix up

00:39:45.512 --> 00:39:47.809
and we should have proper relationship

00:39:47.818 --> 00:39:50.660
with each other, understand that this is my wife,

00:39:50.685 --> 00:39:54.091
this is my husband, and others are my brothers and sisters”.

00:39:54.107 --> 00:39:58.987
Because it was not allowed for any woman even to get out of houses in those days.

00:39:59.012 --> 00:40:01.671
It was so much  [inaudible].

00:40:01.696 --> 00:40:04.769
because the mothers-in-law were very strong and

00:40:04.794 --> 00:40:06.749
they would not allow the daughters to go out.

00:40:06.766 --> 00:40:10.650
The whole episode of Krishna in Gokul is like this.

00:40:11.064 --> 00:40:13.740
And all the stories and songs are like that.

00:40:13.757 --> 00:40:17.395
That a wife says to the husband,

00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:21.557
“Oh my sisters-in-law are a weight, how will I [inaudible].”

00:40:22.792 --> 00:40:26.468
So all the story of love,

00:40:26.805 --> 00:40:30.074
of love between husband and wife,

00:40:30.204 --> 00:40:32.570
He started.

00:40:33.103 --> 00:40:36.202
Now He didn’t have Sahaja Yogis as I have today,

00:40:36.234 --> 00:40:38.362
and disciples around.

00:40:38.625 --> 00:40:41.811
And He had to permeate his powers,

00:40:41.836 --> 00:40:45.401
the sixteen thousand powers He had, at this chakra.

00:40:46.665 --> 00:40:50.374
This chakra is represented here in the head, in front.

00:40:50.694 --> 00:40:53.402
It’s called as Virata chakra,

00:40:53.421 --> 00:40:56.841
means the one he became when he became the Primordial Being.

00:40:59.696 --> 00:41:08.903
So, to have those sixteen thousand conducting human beings,

00:41:08.928 --> 00:41:10.906
He had to play a drama.

00:41:10.922 --> 00:41:13.264
He was a great dramatist.

00:41:13.296 --> 00:41:16.767
He made them take birth as women

00:41:20.081 --> 00:41:27.597
and he got them arrested by a king.

00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:31.696
Now a social problem was created.

00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:36.337
These women were with that man.

00:41:36.362 --> 00:41:40.029
So, according to Indian standards, they are all finished.

00:41:40.041 --> 00:41:41.668
They have no value.

00:41:41.677 --> 00:41:43.446
They are all gone women.

00:41:43.463 --> 00:41:45.799
Though they were by forcing,

00:41:45.824 --> 00:41:48.491
not with their own will, but in India any woman,

00:41:48.516 --> 00:41:53.146
who is even taken by force, at the time of Sita, it has happened.

00:41:54.563 --> 00:41:59.242
So she should be discarded as Rama did, as I told you last time.

00:41:59.267 --> 00:42:03.428
So He attacked this king and got all these sixteen thousand with Him.

00:42:03.437 --> 00:42:07.283
So people said, “You have got these sixteen thousand women,

00:42:07.308 --> 00:42:10.221
who are not to be accepted in the society, so what will you do?

00:42:10.246 --> 00:42:13.296
Nobody is going to marry.” He said, “I will marry them.”

00:42:13.321 --> 00:42:17.545
[Inaudible] you see, actually they were his powers

00:42:17.577 --> 00:42:21.118
and He married them. He said, “I will marry sixteen thousand.”

00:42:21.142 --> 00:42:24.106
It’s all a play, you see it’s the play of the Virata.

00:42:24.114 --> 00:42:26.314
He married those sixteen thousand.

00:42:26.323 --> 00:42:28.516
Now the five elements that He wanted to control.

00:42:28.541 --> 00:42:30.986
He said, “I want to hold on them, we have to have

00:42:31.018 --> 00:42:34.647
everybody [inaudible]. So He created five women

00:42:34.658 --> 00:42:36.913
and He married them also.

00:42:37.016 --> 00:42:40.734
Now many people say, “Oh Krishna has married sixteen thousand

00:42:40.759 --> 00:42:43.071
and had five queens and this and that.”

00:42:43.087 --> 00:42:46.148
Are you Shri Krishna?

00:42:46.173 --> 00:42:48.475
Are you Virata?

00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:52.051
Have you got even one power to flow through?

00:42:52.076 --> 00:42:54.777
If you have one, you can flow through yours.

00:42:54.793 --> 00:42:58.393
He is the one with sixteen thousand powers

00:42:58.418 --> 00:43:02.382
and these powers permeated on this earth

00:43:02.407 --> 00:43:07.212
to give us an awareness by which

00:43:07.237 --> 00:43:11.071
we felt that there is God beyond,

00:43:12.090 --> 00:43:15.608
that there is a Macrocosm,

00:43:15.624 --> 00:43:18.715
that we have to achieve that wholesomeness,

00:43:18.723 --> 00:43:23.486
that we have to become a witness of the play of the whole.

00:43:23.511 --> 00:43:28.716
He made us conscious of Macrocosm at that time.

00:43:29.799 --> 00:43:32.421
He said in Gita that,

00:43:32.437 --> 00:43:37.178
“The Spirit that is within you never dies.

00:43:38.697 --> 00:43:47.229
It again and again comes back to give you Realization

00:43:47.404 --> 00:43:53.268
and when you die, the Spirit does not die”.

00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.526
“Nainam chindanti shastrani, nainam dahati pavakah,

00:43:56.533 --> 00:44:00.370
na chainam kledayanty apo, na sosayati marutah” (Bhagawat Gita, chapter two, verse 23).

00:44:00.396 --> 00:44:03.715
You cannot kill it with a weapon,

00:44:07.291 --> 00:44:10.802
neither you can burn it with fire,

00:44:10.819 --> 00:44:15.386
neither wind can blow it off,

00:44:15.777 --> 00:44:19.723
neither anything can suck it.

00:44:20.378 --> 00:44:24.755
To prove this, Christ came on this earth.

00:44:24.780 --> 00:44:27.184
To prove what Krishna had said,

00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:33.547
Christ came on this earth to show that Spirit is eternal.

00:44:38.166 --> 00:44:40.127
They are all one together.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:43.217
We are the people who cannot see Them like that

00:44:43.249 --> 00:44:45.435
and sometimes it shocks people

00:44:45.451 --> 00:44:48.867
when I tell them about the relationship of Shri Krishna

00:44:48.891 --> 00:44:51.853
and Christ is so close.

00:44:55.102 --> 00:45:01.578
Christ, the name Christ came from the word ‘Krishi’,

00:45:02.785 --> 00:45:10.671
and Krishi word means the farm.

00:45:11.642 --> 00:45:17.187
That means Krishna came on this earth to sow the seed.

00:45:17.201 --> 00:45:20.736
(He was specially) created by Radha who was the subtle energy,

00:45:20.752 --> 00:45:26.108
came on this earth as the mother oh Christ.

00:45:26.133 --> 00:45:30.927
Christ’s mother was a lady who lived

00:45:30.952 --> 00:45:33.786
like a potent energy for Christ.

00:45:33.811 --> 00:45:36.020
Except for Him, nobody knew.

00:45:36.045 --> 00:45:41.362
That’s why at the cross He says, “Behold the Mother.”

00:45:41.387 --> 00:45:44.301
That's very important.

00:45:44.326 --> 00:45:50.158
And He was one of the deitys son [INAUDIBLE] of your Mother.

00:45:51.446 --> 00:45:55.146
Radha incarnated on this earth.

00:45:55.980 --> 00:46:01.994
And she brought this immaculate conception.

00:46:02.019 --> 00:46:05.537
The whole story about it is in the Devi Mahatmya [Bhagavatam],

00:46:05.562 --> 00:46:10.554
when the Goddess created Mahavishnu out of an egg,

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:15.712
and that’s why on the Easter, you celebrate the egg.

00:46:15.738 --> 00:46:21.687
Egg is the suggestion of you being the egg and the next birth.

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:26.235
Easter suggests the second birth of human beings.

00:46:26.244 --> 00:46:31.702
The name of Jesus also comes from the word Yeshoda.

00:46:31.727 --> 00:46:35.024
Yeshoda was the foster mother of Shri Krishna

00:46:35.033 --> 00:46:38.560
and Radha thought that her name must be brought in

00:46:38.585 --> 00:46:41.000
because she was also another power.

00:46:41.025 --> 00:46:45.430
So, Yeshoda is called also as Jesoda

00:46:45.441 --> 00:46:49.024
in the northern parts where Krishna lived.

00:46:49.049 --> 00:46:51.399
She was called actually like Jesoda

00:46:51.423 --> 00:46:55.774
and the small form of Jesoda is Jesu.

00:46:57.278 --> 00:47:01.272
And that’s why He was called as Jesu or Yesu.

00:47:01.297 --> 00:47:03.706
In Indian languages He is called as Yesu,

00:47:03.731 --> 00:47:05.365
[inaudible] Jesu.

00:47:05.389 --> 00:47:08.766
And even in Hebrew, He is called as Yesu, not as Jesu.

00:47:08.791 --> 00:47:11.309
You see this Y and J

00:47:11.334 --> 00:47:14.501
like Yugoslavians and all these people use,

00:47:14.526 --> 00:47:20.277
is a confusion between Y, ya and ja.

00:47:20.303 --> 00:47:24.329
And these two words are confused in the world,

00:47:24.333 --> 00:47:27.443
Yesu or Jesu.

00:47:27.467 --> 00:47:32.512
He came with such powers according to the Devi Mahatmyam,

00:47:32.539 --> 00:47:36.159
that He became the supreme support.

00:47:36.168 --> 00:47:40.135
He is the support at the Mooladhara chakra.

00:47:40.457 --> 00:47:45.406
He is the one who is Ganesha at Mooladhara chakra.

00:47:45.791 --> 00:47:50.452
He’s the support of the whole universe.

00:47:50.477 --> 00:47:53.369
And Krishna placed Him higher than Himself

00:47:53.394 --> 00:47:55.578
because He incarnated higher than Him [at Agnya],

00:47:55.587 --> 00:47:58.173
and Shri Krishna is there.

00:47:58.876 --> 00:48:01.908
If I say that, you should see the vibrations yourself.

00:48:01.917 --> 00:48:05.324
Just see on the vibrations.

00:48:07.138 --> 00:48:12.023
The crucifixion of Christ, which I will tell you later on,

00:48:12.048 --> 00:48:14.605
is another drama.

00:48:14.621 --> 00:48:17.948
It’s another drama to be played.

00:48:18.268 --> 00:48:22.031
Now see the difference between the 6000 years

00:48:22.042 --> 00:48:24.838
and 2000 years of Christ.

00:48:24.854 --> 00:48:28.626
So the 4000 years passed in between.

00:48:28.635 --> 00:48:32.313
In those 4000 years,

00:48:32.561 --> 00:48:35.770
lots of things were to be decided

00:48:35.794 --> 00:48:37.391
and it was decided

00:48:37.409 --> 00:48:41.164
that Christ should be born in Jerusalem,

00:48:41.189 --> 00:48:46.891
in these places that we can call [inaudible].

00:48:47.561 --> 00:48:52.868
Because that was the place which was to be attacked again by the Divine forces

00:48:52.908 --> 00:48:56.871
and always most of these Primordial Masters,

00:48:56.888 --> 00:49:01.701
they are called as gurus, they are born in that area, as Zoroaster.

00:49:01.717 --> 00:49:05.602
You see, most of these people like Mohammed Sahib,

00:49:05.612 --> 00:49:07.399
Shri Zoroaster,

00:49:07.408 --> 00:49:11.172
one after another, three of them came. One personality came first.

00:49:11.198 --> 00:49:13.723
Then Mohammad Sahib came in there,

00:49:13.731 --> 00:49:15.804
then Moses came in, Abraham came in,

00:49:15.829 --> 00:49:19.163
all these people were born in that area.

00:49:19.188 --> 00:49:22.522
And then Christ came it on the nature.

00:49:22.548 --> 00:49:26.900
He thought that would be the best place where these

00:49:26.912 --> 00:49:28.912
great Primordial Masters have worked

00:49:28.937 --> 00:49:30.782
[inaudible]

00:49:30.807 --> 00:49:35.493
and that they will be able to understand.

00:49:36.279 --> 00:49:39.718
But people as they are, they killed Mohammad Sahib,

00:49:39.733 --> 00:49:42.282
they also killed Christ.

00:49:42.306 --> 00:49:44.151
They never listened to Moses,

00:49:44.167 --> 00:49:46.238
they never listened to Christ.

00:49:46.264 --> 00:49:49.781
People are like that and today I find

00:49:49.806 --> 00:49:53.182
many people who call themselves Christians are the people

00:49:53.207 --> 00:49:56.750
who were there to enjoy His crucifixion,

00:49:57.123 --> 00:50:00.175
who liked it, supported it and crucified Him.

00:50:00.191 --> 00:50:02.552
Today they are moving with a Bible in their hand

00:50:02.577 --> 00:50:05.552
saying that this is this, this is this.

00:50:05.975 --> 00:50:11.289
So unauthorized, so dangerous!

00:50:12.833 --> 00:50:18.160
Now it is better sometimes to read

00:50:18.185 --> 00:50:21.893
what Krishna has to say about Christ.

00:50:22.412 --> 00:50:25.381
But just now today as we are first dealing

00:50:25.406 --> 00:50:30.483
with the Vishuddhi chakra, I’ll talk about Christ later on.

00:50:31.595 --> 00:50:34.383
Vishuddhi chakra has two other points,

00:50:34.408 --> 00:50:36.424
which are very important within us.

00:50:36.449 --> 00:50:42.515
I have to take this up because you people are suffering from Left Vishuddhi.

00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:47.267
Left Vishuddhi is on the left-hand side and right on the right-hand side.

00:50:47.942 --> 00:50:51.977
Right hand side Vishuddhi is the Vishuddhi when

00:50:52.002 --> 00:50:56.099
when He was the king and called as Vitthala and His wife Rukmini.

00:50:56.101 --> 00:50:58.147
They lived in Dwarika [unsure].

00:50:58.172 --> 00:51:00.505
This is the ‘raj’, raja

00:51:00.530 --> 00:51:05.537
or you can say the ‘rajasa’, means the kingliness or the

00:51:05.558 --> 00:51:07.565
[UNCLEAR]

00:51:08.125 --> 00:51:11.592
action, where He wanted to act as a king,

00:51:11.601 --> 00:51:14.706
is on the right-hand side.
The left-hand side is the one

00:51:14.730 --> 00:51:22.764
where He was born and in his early life,

00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:26.381
when He had a sister.

00:51:26.406 --> 00:51:29.496
His sister was actually the daughter of Yeshoda who was sacrificed,

00:51:29.504 --> 00:51:30.934
it’s a big story,

00:51:30.959 --> 00:51:34.023
how Krishna was born in a jail and was taken

00:51:34.048 --> 00:51:41.389
by his father and put it in a place called Gokul.

00:51:41.400 --> 00:51:45.107
And the child in that place who was a girl was sent

00:51:45.132 --> 00:51:52.154
and She is the one who appears as the lightning in the air.

00:51:52.897 --> 00:51:55.872
And how She became the lightning when She was killed

00:51:55.897 --> 00:51:59.915
and announced that, “Your killer is still alive.”

00:52:00.165 --> 00:52:03.462
to the horrible rakshasa

00:52:03.502 --> 00:52:09.062
who was actually the brother of Krishna’s mother.

00:52:09.087 --> 00:52:14.337
And it was announced that the eighth child of

00:52:15.377 --> 00:52:18.549
this Devaki, his sister, Kamsa’s sister,

00:52:18.567 --> 00:52:23.577
Kamsa is a rakshasa, is a devil, will kill him.

00:52:23.602 --> 00:52:28.088
And this frightened him so much that he started killing

00:52:28.105 --> 00:52:30.482
all the children that were born to this Devaki,

00:52:30.490 --> 00:52:33.856
his sister, who was put in the jail.

00:52:34.309 --> 00:52:37.013
The last one was Shri Krishna

00:52:37.038 --> 00:52:40.038
and when He was born, everybody slept off

00:52:40.373 --> 00:52:42.525
and the doors opened up

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:46.378
and His father carried Him in a basket,

00:52:46.395 --> 00:52:48.770
just like Moses story it is,

00:52:48.802 --> 00:52:50.575
and crossed the river Yamuna

00:52:50.592 --> 00:52:53.696
and when the river touched Shri Krishna’s feet it

00:52:53.705 --> 00:52:57.413
again went down, crossed over, went to Gokul,

00:52:57.422 --> 00:53:00.400
put the child there, took the child of Nand-

00:53:00.425 --> 00:53:04.237
Yeshoda and brought the child back and he placed it.

00:53:04.709 --> 00:53:08.410
When the child was replaced, you see, it was a girl.

00:53:08.434 --> 00:53:12.374
So Kamsa came and said, “The eighth is girl, how can it be?”

00:53:12.382 --> 00:53:15.751
So then he just found the girl and

00:53:15.776 --> 00:53:19.554
She went up and She announced that,

00:53:19.579 --> 00:53:23.536
“The killer of you, Kamsa is born and

00:53:23.568 --> 00:53:27.360
is living very much and He is going to

00:53:27.385 --> 00:53:31.657
is going to kill you, beware.”

00:53:31.682 --> 00:53:35.557
And then the story is that how He tried to kill him,

00:53:35.582 --> 00:53:37.472
so that, we don’t have to bother about that.

00:53:37.497 --> 00:53:41.182
But the main thing I’m telling, was this sister of Shri Krishna.

00:53:42.273 --> 00:53:44.640
Now the Left Vishuddhi problem starts

00:53:44.648 --> 00:53:48.081
when we get confused about sisters’ relationship

00:53:49.943 --> 00:53:52.458
or the pure relationships like a mother,

00:53:52.475 --> 00:53:55.571
this is Mr. Freud’s business, you see.

00:53:56.662 --> 00:54:00.092
All kinds of confusions, creating problems

00:54:00.117 --> 00:54:03.967
about relationships with other men, other women,

00:54:03.992 --> 00:54:06.773
there’s no understanding.

00:54:06.782 --> 00:54:10.721
Anyone who is married, unmarried, anything

00:54:10.730 --> 00:54:13.121
cast eyes towards someone,

00:54:13.129 --> 00:54:14.926
to have adulterous eyes towards others.

00:54:14.951 --> 00:54:18.022
That’s why Krishna- Christ at this point had to say,

00:54:18.031 --> 00:54:20.605
there is no sanctity in the eyes, that’s why He said

00:54:20.629 --> 00:54:23.369
that, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes”.

00:54:23.377 --> 00:54:26.165
But that’s not possible without Realization, I have seen,

00:54:26.182 --> 00:54:28.349
when we have [inaudible].

00:54:28.374 --> 00:54:33.172
So all these perverse ideas about men and women relationships

00:54:33.197 --> 00:54:37.851
are there, and in the subconsciously they create a guilt.

00:54:37.876 --> 00:54:42.356
You know it’s wrong, you know, at the base of your heart, you know that.

00:54:42.381 --> 00:54:47.147
But the ego has gone so much there, people say, “What’s wrong?”

00:54:47.172 --> 00:54:50.429
That’s why I see people in the West are at least innocent.

00:54:50.446 --> 00:54:52.314
They know it is not wrong.

00:54:52.330 --> 00:54:56.141
But in the East, in India, people know it is wrong,

00:54:56.166 --> 00:54:58.487
still they do wrong, means they are not innocent people at all,

00:54:58.503 --> 00:55:00.441
they know this is wrong and still they do,

00:55:00.457 --> 00:55:02.497
then they are not innocent.

00:55:02.521 --> 00:55:06.851
So all those Indians, who try to do these things knowingly that it is wrong,

00:55:06.859 --> 00:55:10.997
are the wrong type of people because they have lost their innocence.

00:55:12.793 --> 00:55:19.332
Now this is one of the things why we catch on Left Vishuddhi, very much in West.

00:55:19.882 --> 00:55:23.114
But the second one is even-

00:55:23.122 --> 00:55:28.327
another thing is just to sit down and analyse yourself.

00:55:29.091 --> 00:55:35.000
This is basically, some sort of a funny sort of a guilt that is built in us.

00:55:35.025 --> 00:55:38.336
Or sometimes it is the superego, some sort of a possession,

00:55:38.361 --> 00:55:42.094
you start analysing and just murdering yourself morning till evening.

00:55:42.119 --> 00:55:44.281
“I should not have said this”, “Why did I do it?”,

00:55:44.306 --> 00:55:47.108
“I should not have gone there”, “I should not”.

00:55:47.133 --> 00:55:50.907
May be it is Catholicism. It could be anything.

00:55:50.926 --> 00:55:56.204
Jews also go and weep and they go on repenting things,

00:55:56.229 --> 00:55:59.572
and when you have repented, finished.

00:55:59.576 --> 00:56:01.792
If you have repented then it is finished.

00:56:01.817 --> 00:56:05.461
Why are you go on, still carrying on with the guilt within you?

00:56:05.486 --> 00:56:09.410
And this left-sided is too much.

00:56:09.435 --> 00:56:13.652
So much so that My hand gets really paralyzed

00:56:13.677 --> 00:56:17.378
with the vibrations flowing all the time, this left side.

00:56:17.403 --> 00:56:20.668
That’s why I say, you go on saying one mantra. “I am not guilty”,

00:56:20.693 --> 00:56:24.234
“I am not guilty”, “I am not guilty”.

00:56:24.266 --> 00:56:28.024
Because you go on suggesting to yourself that you are not guilty.

00:56:28.033 --> 00:56:30.901
All the time sitting down and analysing yourself.

00:56:30.926 --> 00:56:33.126
And also the society is like this,

00:56:33.151 --> 00:56:35.614
from the very beginning we are told, “You should not have done this,

00:56:35.639 --> 00:56:38.131
you should have done this.
This, you should not have done,

00:56:38.156 --> 00:56:40.634
this carpet is spoilt, that is spoilt”.

00:56:40.658 --> 00:56:47.861
So the whole thing builds like a guilt.

00:56:47.886 --> 00:56:52.217
For nothing at all you are guilty, I mean it’s such a fake stuff.

00:56:52.225 --> 00:56:55.227
And you believe in that and the gurus play on it.

00:56:55.252 --> 00:56:58.650
They say, “These are your karmas”. So, you are doomed in.

00:57:00.718 --> 00:57:03.467
So, on the Left Vishuddhi, you have this guilt business.

00:57:03.492 --> 00:57:07.628
On the Right Vishuddhi, you are extremely talkative

00:57:08.297 --> 00:57:10.267
and you are being arrogant.

00:57:10.292 --> 00:57:12.541
Such people can be great orators,

00:57:12.548 --> 00:57:15.042
they can shout at the top of their voices,

00:57:15.067 --> 00:57:17.496
they can control people with their oratory.

00:57:17.505 --> 00:57:19.692
The right side with which

00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:23.136
they built that kind of an action, is their style.

00:57:23.893 --> 00:57:26.157
There are so many things one has to say

00:57:26.173 --> 00:57:28.354
about [inaudible] comes in, and how it becomes

00:57:28.379 --> 00:57:30.133
a [inaudible] and all efforts.

00:57:30.158 --> 00:57:32.468
Let it be, don’t complicate it. [unsure].

00:57:32.493 --> 00:57:36.217
So now this is how you develop the complications

00:57:36.220 --> 00:57:40.191
on the left and the right sides.

00:57:40.892 --> 00:57:44.640
When the center is upset,

00:57:44.665 --> 00:57:49.065
then you take the responsibility of everything on yourself.

00:57:49.067 --> 00:57:51.668
You are running like a mad horse.

00:57:51.693 --> 00:57:55.064
You are like a bull, I should say.

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.066
And you do all the gross job.

00:57:57.091 --> 00:58:00.326
And you think, “Oh you are such a nice man, in your heart”.

00:58:00.351 --> 00:58:05.312
You feel, “Oh, I will have that” or “I’ll get it, I will do it”.

00:58:05.337 --> 00:58:09.167
You take the responsibility of the whole world upon your head

00:58:09.192 --> 00:58:13.266
and you start saying, “Oh I feel so bad that I could not help in Vietnam”.

00:58:13.273 --> 00:58:15.826
You cannot help, how are you connected?

00:58:15.834 --> 00:58:17.830
“I’m so bad with Cambodia.

00:58:17.855 --> 00:58:19.402
I should have done something.” You cannot do it.

00:58:19.427 --> 00:58:23.189
By just sitting in Australia, you look after Australian problems,

00:58:23.204 --> 00:58:28.356
Sydney problems, family problems and your own problems!

00:58:28.381 --> 00:58:32.305
Start it from there. ‘Charity begins at home’.

00:58:32.493 --> 00:58:36.891
People always try to see the problems of another.

00:58:36.899 --> 00:58:38.960
Like if I’m there and you tell Me,

00:58:38.985 --> 00:58:41.586
“Why there’s poverty in India?”

00:58:41.586 --> 00:58:44.009
Really, very seriously they ask Me the question.

00:58:44.034 --> 00:58:48.026
I said, “Who is responsible for your own poverty is”.

00:58:49.808 --> 00:58:52.634
That, “Why don’t you think of your own problems?”

00:58:52.659 --> 00:58:55.389
When I am in your Australia, I’m out and out.

00:58:55.404 --> 00:58:58.165
When I am in India, I am in India out and out.

00:58:58.190 --> 00:59:00.718
Why would you be anguish [unsure].

00:59:00.743 --> 00:59:03.343
That’s how you should be also. You need to face your problems,

00:59:03.368 --> 00:59:05.983
what are your problems? These are the problems,

00:59:05.997 --> 00:59:08.925
that you feel guilty for nothing at all.

00:59:10.980 --> 00:59:13.050
You’ve being conditioned like that.

00:59:13.075 --> 00:59:17.258
And then if you get out of the guilt, you become egoistical.

00:59:17.283 --> 00:59:20.824
You say, “I hate you” and when you quarrel, “bapre”,

00:59:20.831 --> 00:59:24.228
you really bark. There’s no softness anymore.

00:59:24.242 --> 00:59:27.920
It’s such a horrible voice starts coming

00:59:27.949 --> 00:59:31.663
that I knew that Australians are fighting.

00:59:34.006 --> 00:59:37.461
When you take to drinking, you go to the other side.

00:59:37.468 --> 00:59:40.742
I mean, when we were coming to Australia, they were blaming.

00:59:40.757 --> 00:59:44.983
They were drinking so much and talking so much after that,

00:59:44.991 --> 00:59:47.528
nobody could sleep even for a minute.

00:59:47.528 --> 00:59:49.489
And so loudly they were talking

00:59:49.514 --> 00:59:53.838
that I was thinking even fish market in Bombay is better than that.

00:59:55.107 --> 00:59:57.718
And they had lost all capacity to understand

00:59:57.743 --> 00:59:59.756
that there are people who want to sleep

00:59:59.781 --> 01:00:02.449
and they are talking so loudly that

01:00:02.474 --> 01:00:05.362
like a there was a mouth piece on the

01:00:05.363 --> 01:00:07.966
near their lips, the way they were on and on and on,

01:00:07.991 --> 01:00:09.872
all of them talking very loudly.

01:00:09.889 --> 01:00:11.771
You go to a reception,

01:00:12.585 --> 01:00:15.574
you don’t see any meeting, you talk, all right.

01:00:15.602 --> 01:00:18.063
But the other one doesn’t listen to you, you don’t listen to him.

01:00:18.088 --> 01:00:21.231
You go on talk, talk, talk, talk, talk, very fast.

01:00:21.256 --> 01:00:24.323
You just don’t know what they are talking, what you are talking.

01:00:24.333 --> 01:00:27.500
They say, “Yes, yes, yes.” You nod your head and he nods his head,

01:00:30.551 --> 01:00:33.252
and you don’t know what they are talking, what they are saying,

01:00:33.260 --> 01:00:35.009
and then you say, “Oh, I’ve been to a reception”[inaudible].

01:00:35.025 --> 01:00:37.215
Then you come out and go to another reception,

01:00:37.224 --> 01:00:40.043
[unclear],

01:00:40.068 --> 01:00:43.514
...and such and such come in; you shake hands, all right.

01:00:43.533 --> 01:00:47.051
Such a sad perspective, what is the need?

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:50.728
It’s all, there’s no rapport, there’s no understanding.

01:00:50.753 --> 01:00:53.859
And if there is, it is for flirting, that’s all,

01:00:53.884 --> 01:00:56.386
which is another one, I told you, is nothing

01:00:56.411 --> 01:00:59.262
but the play of the spirits through your eyes.

01:00:59.267 --> 01:01:00.939
That’s why Christ had shown

01:01:00.965 --> 01:01:04.458
you and He said, “Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.”

01:01:04.467 --> 01:01:08.365
Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes.

01:01:10.877 --> 01:01:14.109
Any Christian who has adulterous eyes should know that

01:01:14.134 --> 01:01:17.421
first step to Christianity is not there.

01:01:18.695 --> 01:01:21.712
He said it so clearly.

01:01:21.738 --> 01:01:27.019
So very clearly, emphatically he told you, to understand

01:01:27.035 --> 01:01:31.723
that your eyes are very important and they have to be pure.

01:01:32.384 --> 01:01:36.552
They have to be honest and pure eyes

01:01:36.577 --> 01:01:40.360
I like the way people in Australia

01:01:40.385 --> 01:01:45.388
like my honesty of telling them anything that is honest.

01:01:45.413 --> 01:01:50.610
It’s so sweet of you because some things can be quite hard.

01:01:50.635 --> 01:01:53.725
To believe and to take it,

01:01:53.750 --> 01:01:56.441
though I speak softly about them,

01:01:56.467 --> 01:01:58.675
I am very clever to put it through.

01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:01.781
But the way you see it,

01:02:01.806 --> 01:02:05.824
because perhaps you see that honesty in Me.

01:02:05.842 --> 01:02:09.050
I am not here to please you or to displease you,

01:02:09.067 --> 01:02:11.512
but to tell you the truth

01:02:11.521 --> 01:02:14.096
in such a way that you will not get a shock

01:02:14.098 --> 01:02:16.264
and you start absorbing it.

01:02:16.289 --> 01:02:20.172
Because that is what you are asking for.

01:02:21.185 --> 01:02:24.019
So at this stage,

01:02:24.044 --> 01:02:27.910
the awareness becomes collectively conscious,

01:02:27.921 --> 01:02:30.081
started becoming collectively conscious.

01:02:30.106 --> 01:02:33.353
This is the beginning of it.

01:02:35.078 --> 01:02:41.870
But now the incoming of Christ, the advent of Christ

01:02:41.887 --> 01:02:44.684
was specially described.

01:02:45.272 --> 01:02:48.671
Thousands of years back, it was started with an egg.

01:02:48.679 --> 01:02:55.796
He was created with three Pranava, the Omkara,

01:02:55.810 --> 01:02:59.043
‘logos’ as we call it.

01:02:59.068 --> 01:03:06.078
The sound that is the complete energy, Omkar,

01:03:06.103 --> 01:03:11.533
Omkar, the word.

01:03:12.495 --> 01:03:14.957
You can say the word.

01:03:14.964 --> 01:03:19.563
He is that energy embodied,

01:03:20.208 --> 01:03:23.879
because He had to prove that the Spirit is eternal.

01:03:23.887 --> 01:03:25.546
He is the Spirit.

01:03:25.562 --> 01:03:28.009
At all these centers, He is there.

01:03:28.034 --> 01:03:29.749
These vibrations are nothing

01:03:29.774 --> 01:03:34.333
but a emission or manifestation of His being.

01:03:35.509 --> 01:03:39.513
So He cannot be killed, what is that?

01:03:41.781 --> 01:03:47.260
He cannot be dead, He cannot be destroyed.

01:03:47.285 --> 01:03:51.265
Because He’s just the energy of Spirit.

01:03:51.290 --> 01:03:53.069
That was the embodiment of Christ,

01:03:53.094 --> 01:03:57.048
that He was brought on this earth

01:03:57.073 --> 01:04:01.514
and He was crucified suggestive of this gate here

01:04:01.522 --> 01:04:03.346
He had to penetrate.

01:04:03.371 --> 01:04:06.201
This very important gate here,

01:04:06.209 --> 01:04:08.004
which is the Agnya chakra,

01:04:08.013 --> 01:04:11.039
which He had to penetrate.

01:04:12.001 --> 01:04:19.075
By penetrating this, He created a space in

01:04:19.100 --> 01:04:21.782
the ego and the superego.

01:04:21.784 --> 01:04:24.474
This space is the space where they say

01:04:24.483 --> 01:04:28.185
that, “Christ is the one

01:04:28.200 --> 01:04:31.005
who has taken the sins of the human beings in Him”.

01:04:31.030 --> 01:04:34.030
He is the lamb that was sacrificed.

01:04:34.064 --> 01:04:38.242
In the olden India, they used to sacrifice lambs.

01:04:38.267 --> 01:04:41.158
If you have done anything bad, you take a lamb

01:04:41.167 --> 01:04:44.605
and sacrifice it at the altar of the cross.

01:04:45.465 --> 01:04:50.087
Those who do not know about Christ are still doing it.

01:04:50.583 --> 01:04:56.085
And those who know about Christ also sacrifice [inaudible].

01:04:56.110 --> 01:05:01.766
So the karma theory finishes off at the point where Christ came in.

01:05:01.791 --> 01:05:06.121
Because He is the one who is capable of sucking your ego and superego, both.

01:05:06.146 --> 01:05:08.599
On one side He sucks your ego,

01:05:08.618 --> 01:05:10.962
on the other side He sucks your superego.

01:05:10.986 --> 01:05:13.747
He is the one who drove

01:05:13.750 --> 01:05:18.491
drove the spirits into the pigs and the pigs were

01:05:18.516 --> 01:05:20.002
dragged into the sea.

01:05:20.018 --> 01:05:23.575
I mean He did so many such things, but

01:05:23.856 --> 01:05:27.215
because of these disciples,

01:05:27.239 --> 01:05:29.844
it is not depicted fully.

01:05:29.869 --> 01:05:32.731
But He so clearly showed that there are spirits

01:05:32.756 --> 01:05:34.874
and that you have nothing to do with the dead.

01:05:34.876 --> 01:05:37.632
But the Christians, who call themselves Christians,

01:05:37.657 --> 01:05:40.753
are just anti-Christ in this aspect.

01:05:40.770 --> 01:05:43.716
They’ll have all the dead bodies in the church and sitting on the

01:05:43.719 --> 01:05:45.607
layers of dead bodies,

01:05:45.616 --> 01:05:47.205
all the spirits hovering around,

01:05:47.229 --> 01:05:50.691
your children are attacked and you are attacked.

01:05:52.051 --> 01:05:54.825
I am not against the church.

01:05:54.842 --> 01:06:00.646
Church if it is for the Realized souls, is a very [good?] thing.

01:06:01.674 --> 01:06:07.115
There is no reality in a church where they do not have Christ in there.

01:06:07.886 --> 01:06:09.904
Christ is the Spirit.

01:06:09.912 --> 01:06:17.108
If the church tries hard to be reborn, then it is a church.

01:06:17.603 --> 01:06:21.667
Otherwise, the rest of the things are just lip services.

01:06:21.692 --> 01:06:24.640
They are lip services.

01:06:25.683 --> 01:06:29.821
Now another thing, all the Christians,

01:06:29.833 --> 01:06:34.040
all the Christian nations are very much interested

01:06:34.065 --> 01:06:38.610
all kinds of these dead things and clairvoyance.

01:06:38.635 --> 01:06:40.462
“Oh I am told that there are some clairvoyance”,

01:06:40.487 --> 01:06:43.667
they are very, very flourishing people.

01:06:43.692 --> 01:06:46.781
It is very dangerous to go near them.

01:06:46.806 --> 01:06:52.342
Cancer, blood cancer, epilepsy,

01:06:52.367 --> 01:06:58.435
heart attacks, accidents, financial ruin,

01:06:58.460 --> 01:07:01.830
all these things can come to you through these mediums.

01:07:01.838 --> 01:07:04.823
You have no control over them.

01:07:05.088 --> 01:07:08.343
They say she is very good lady, he is very good gentleman.

01:07:08.352 --> 01:07:11.806
He may be good or bad but what about the ones which are coming in.

01:07:11.831 --> 01:07:12.831
Can you see them?

01:07:12.856 --> 01:07:14.469
You know who are coming?

01:07:14.494 --> 01:07:19.736
It’s like having a licence without any passes without any exams.

01:07:20.411 --> 01:07:23.127
Why go to the dead?

01:07:23.127 --> 01:07:26.139
But the Christian nations are resembling England,

01:07:26.167 --> 01:07:29.323
which is supposed to be the heart of the universe.

01:07:29.348 --> 01:07:33.743
Every tenth house, somebody sitting with a ‘planchette’ [to call the dead spirits]

01:07:33.768 --> 01:07:37.772
talking to the great grandfather

01:07:38.070 --> 01:07:41.805
to know where there are still in the property,

01:07:42.489 --> 01:07:44.634
or some such a thing.

01:07:45.515 --> 01:07:50.958
Every tenth house you see, and so much!

01:07:51.458 --> 01:07:56.401
Then whatever was less then

01:07:56.426 --> 01:08:00.858
was completed by the gurus from India.

01:08:00.874 --> 01:08:02.535
Some of them came out of the jail.

01:08:02.560 --> 01:08:05.632
They had no place to go, they wore those dresses and went out.

01:08:05.657 --> 01:08:08.732
They remained planning straight [inaudible].

01:08:08.757 --> 01:08:11.369
Then some of them are [inaudible],

01:08:11.385 --> 01:08:15.620
they are [inaudible], and they became gurus.

01:08:15.636 --> 01:08:18.386
Whatever they talk is horrible Hindi

01:08:18.411 --> 01:08:20.276
or horrible Marathi or whatever it is.

01:08:20.301 --> 01:08:23.199
In Sanskrit, it’s called ?-English.

01:08:23.223 --> 01:08:27.710
Being English as [inaudible] politically, openly, ego oriented,

01:08:27.735 --> 01:08:31.532
but these are disturbing  slyly from superego.

01:08:31.542 --> 01:08:33.274
And these gurus are making him dance,

01:08:33.299 --> 01:08:36.125
there’s one who wants Rolls Royce.

01:08:36.895 --> 01:08:39.938
Last time, he asked for a Rolls Royce.

01:08:39.949 --> 01:08:42.108
He has got 58, and wanted the 59th.

01:08:42.133 --> 01:08:44.698
Actually, he was going to buy a [?]

01:08:44.707 --> 01:08:47.868
but somehow fizzled it out.

01:08:47.893 --> 01:08:49.891
And that’s how the people are there,

01:08:49.916 --> 01:08:53.273
and these very harm English people

01:08:53.306 --> 01:08:57.127
who don’t want to eat their food without the drink cokes

01:08:57.152 --> 01:09:01.346
are held by their tails, by these horrible gurus.

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:05.519
Without knowing how much they are befeld.

01:09:05.527 --> 01:09:10.908
And even grown-ups and old elderly lords have hit it.

01:09:10.926 --> 01:09:16.214
There was one lord’s son who died.

01:09:16.230 --> 01:09:18.628
He was trying to fly in the air.

01:09:18.653 --> 01:09:22.092
The father was in it– father and mother were downstairs,

01:09:22.101 --> 01:09:24.898
father about 70 years of age and wife about 65

01:09:24.923 --> 01:09:28.844
and they were trying to fly downstairs and upstairs

01:09:28.862 --> 01:09:32.133
was the daughter in law and the son.

01:09:32.142 --> 01:09:35.455
And the son collapsed, he died.

01:09:35.480 --> 01:09:40.078
So the lady, the wife came and told that, “He is dead”.

01:09:41.003 --> 01:09:44.622
So they were very happy, he is now gone to heaven,

01:09:44.647 --> 01:09:48.024
he has achieved his last life. Imagine these lords,

01:09:48.027 --> 01:09:51.814
these scholarly lords.

01:09:51.830 --> 01:09:55.190
And some Sahaja Yogis went to tell him, he says, “Don’t tell us,

01:09:55.199 --> 01:09:57.456
don’t come in our happiness and joy,

01:09:57.473 --> 01:09:59.982
our son has gone to heaven,

01:09:59.999 --> 01:10:02.820
and we are all going to go there.”

01:10:05.822 --> 01:10:07.362
[Inaudible]

01:10:09.798 --> 01:10:12.107
I can’t understand this.

01:10:12.116 --> 01:10:15.458
What has happened to their brains?

01:10:15.474 --> 01:10:20.074
They are told that you take a drum,

01:10:20.099 --> 01:10:22.012
stand on Oxford street,

01:10:22.029 --> 01:10:24.332
wear that horrible dress, go on dancing

01:10:24.357 --> 01:10:28.470
in God’s name and [inaudible], then you’ll go to God.

01:10:28.481 --> 01:10:32.007
How will you believe such nonsense?

01:10:32.032 --> 01:10:35.519
And for Sahaja Yogis, I must tell you,

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:37.572
I had six of them.

01:10:37.588 --> 01:10:40.635
All scholars turned into hippies,

01:10:40.652 --> 01:10:45.656
scholars from Oxford, and from Cambridge.

01:10:45.681 --> 01:10:49.804
Oxford you know, ford car combined with an Ox.

01:10:52.092 --> 01:10:57.406
They really, completely exhausted Me.

01:10:57.431 --> 01:11:00.538
Four years, I worked on them!

01:11:00.562 --> 01:11:07.600
I said, “Oh God, these stones, what am I to do with them?”

01:11:07.625 --> 01:11:10.775
They liked the food I cooked, the liked the house I lived,

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:15.529
they liked the way I was, everything, but nothing happened to the Kundalini.

01:11:17.661 --> 01:11:19.671
And then it did happen.

01:11:19.687 --> 01:11:23.681
Very difficult nuts to break, but now doesn’t matter,

01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:25.691
they all found .

01:11:25.716 --> 01:11:29.353
They found out that Sahaja Yoga, it is spontaneous in Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:29.378 --> 01:11:31.088
Everything points to Sahaja Yoga.

01:11:31.113 --> 01:11:33.295
Everything points to Kundalini awakening.

01:11:33.311 --> 01:11:36.421
It’s there, they recognized, even logically they recognized.

01:11:36.446 --> 01:11:38.605
It’s absolutely logical.

01:11:41.693 --> 01:11:45.532
I am here because of them, I should say.

01:11:45.557 --> 01:11:47.309
They always failed.

01:11:47.325 --> 01:11:50.858
They have a guilt about Australia

01:11:50.883 --> 01:11:54.669
that they ill-treated people for very little offences,

01:11:54.694 --> 01:11:57.426
like even stealing the bread and all that.

01:11:57.450 --> 01:12:00.722
They sent away these people to hell.

01:12:00.747 --> 01:12:03.511
Now I mean, [UNCLEAR]

01:12:03.536 --> 01:12:06.001
it’s a heaven.

01:12:06.369 --> 01:12:08.839
You got heaven in punishment,

01:12:08.864 --> 01:12:12.634
compared to that dirty London, nowadays.

01:12:16.238 --> 01:12:19.668
It’s nice to go and see. Every time you go out

01:12:19.693 --> 01:12:22.028
you have to have an umbrella, even people play football

01:12:22.033 --> 01:12:24.291
with an umbrella in their hand.

01:12:24.974 --> 01:12:28.327
It’s a mad place, the [UNCLEAR] place I don't know.

01:12:28.337 --> 01:12:30.307
But it is in Me.

01:12:30.317 --> 01:12:35.111
It is the heart of the universe.

01:12:35.136 --> 01:12:37.854
Everything circulates from there.

01:12:37.862 --> 01:12:40.514
All your laws, all your governing things,

01:12:40.539 --> 01:12:43.557
everything comes from there.

01:12:43.582 --> 01:12:46.933
So I had to work very hard, I know.

01:12:46.958 --> 01:12:50.310
But now we have really beautiful Sahaja Yogis,

01:12:50.335 --> 01:12:53.131
which are tremendous.

01:12:53.156 --> 01:12:55.737
And thanks to William Blake,

01:12:55.754 --> 01:13:00.847
he has already prophesized so much about Sahaja Yoga,

01:13:00.864 --> 01:13:03.571
about what will happen, even where I lived,

01:13:03.596 --> 01:13:07.169
where ashram will be, everything is so much in details.

01:13:07.178 --> 01:13:11.316
That now things are getting very much better in here.

01:13:11.335 --> 01:13:14.908
So now, we come back from there, to our Agnya chakra,

01:13:14.933 --> 01:13:18.760
the center where Christ came in.

01:13:18.785 --> 01:13:20.591
There is ego and superego.

01:13:20.616 --> 01:13:25.101
He came at a point which is in the center of the ego and superego,

01:13:25.109 --> 01:13:27.797
which is controlled by pituitary, the ego is controlled,

01:13:27.822 --> 01:13:30.147
and the pineal body controls the superego.

01:13:30.172 --> 01:13:32.556
In between them, at the optic chiasma,

01:13:32.581 --> 01:13:34.930
in the center of the optic chiasma, He came.

01:13:34.954 --> 01:13:38.250
That’s why eyes are very important for Me.

01:13:38.267 --> 01:13:41.365
Because eyes are controlled by this center.

01:13:41.381 --> 01:13:44.423
There are two petals to that: ‘ham, ksham’.

01:13:44.434 --> 01:13:46.322
These are the two sounds

01:13:46.347 --> 01:13:49.459
that come out of those two petals, ham, ksham.

01:13:49.471 --> 01:13:52.901
On one side, left side,

01:13:52.934 --> 01:13:56.078
when the person is in superego

01:13:56.103 --> 01:14:00.043
They are sadists, that’s how they call them, people

01:14:00.052 --> 01:14:02.999
who like domination, who like beating up and all,

01:14:03.024 --> 01:14:04.177
I mean the extreme cases.

01:14:04.202 --> 01:14:06.775
I mean, in India we do not have this extreme type,

01:14:06.800 --> 01:14:08.704
we have people who are submissive

01:14:08.721 --> 01:14:10.818
or we have people who are arrogant, at the most.

01:14:10.843 --> 01:14:13.089
But this, the husband beating the wife

01:14:13.106 --> 01:14:15.901
with a hunter or some women liking it,

01:14:15.925 --> 01:14:18.395
this kind of nonsense I have not heard of.

01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:22.564
But you see, you go to such extremes in everything whatsoever.

01:14:22.589 --> 01:14:25.558
“All right. If we have to be suppressed all right,

01:14:25.583 --> 01:14:27.958
let us get beatings,

01:14:28.674 --> 01:14:31.516
let us go on suffering.”

01:14:31.541 --> 01:14:33.409
Why should you suffer?

01:14:33.417 --> 01:14:35.600
Christ has suffered for you.

01:14:37.159 --> 01:14:40.407
What is the need for you to suffer, I just don’t understand.

01:14:40.431 --> 01:14:42.808
And make a drama out of it, “We are suffering”.

01:14:42.833 --> 01:14:45.253
‘Les Misérables’

01:14:46.899 --> 01:14:48.980
like the French.

01:14:49.005 --> 01:14:51.014
French are very ‘Les Misérables’,

01:14:51.022 --> 01:14:53.017
really very difficult people,

01:14:53.042 --> 01:14:55.226
you can’t carry on with them.

01:14:55.234 --> 01:14:59.641
They think they are ‘Les Misérables’, making everybody miserable.

01:15:00.191 --> 01:15:04.107
In the same way, we also take to this kind of an idea,

01:15:04.132 --> 01:15:07.953
“Oh we are suffering, we are very unhappy people”,

01:15:07.978 --> 01:15:12.465
We start all sort of nonsensical emotional dramas we play.

01:15:12.473 --> 01:15:14.960
And “Why are you laughing,

01:15:14.977 --> 01:15:16.820
why are you enjoying yourself?”

01:15:16.845 --> 01:15:18.989
Like I went to France. I told you the story.

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:21.142
They said, “Mother, don’t say that You are a happy person.

01:15:21.167 --> 01:15:23.303
They won’t like it. They will say you are not sensitive.”

01:15:23.328 --> 01:15:24.328
I said, “Really?”

01:15:25.577 --> 01:15:28.166
Then I went to make fun at the whole stuff.

01:15:28.191 --> 01:15:30.462
But this is what it is.

01:15:30.487 --> 01:15:34.315
We go to the extremes, we torture ourselves

01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:36.151
we go on condemning ourselves,

01:15:36.159 --> 01:15:39.962
“Oh I am so bad, I am good for nothing, I am useless.”

01:15:39.970 --> 01:15:41.966
We had a gentleman like that with us.

01:15:41.990 --> 01:15:45.277
He did only one thing is to read lord Byron.

01:15:45.302 --> 01:15:47.948
That man, you should never read, I tell you.

01:15:47.957 --> 01:15:50.435
What a life le led! He himself was a horrible,

01:15:50.460 --> 01:15:55.566
licentious man and he writes about The Prisoner of Chillon.

01:15:55.591 --> 01:15:57.537
This lord Byron did it.

01:15:57.562 --> 01:16:00.103
Now he became the prisoner, you see,

01:16:00.111 --> 01:16:02.622
without any prison, without anything.

01:16:02.647 --> 01:16:05.720
He is the prisoner, this gentleman, his name is Ronnie.

01:16:05.760 --> 01:16:10.066
And Ronnie is the one who cries in Indian language, ‘Ronie’.

01:16:10.091 --> 01:16:13.702
So this Mr. Ronnie all the time used to cry,

01:16:13.727 --> 01:16:16.014
weep, sleep in his bed,

01:16:16.038 --> 01:16:19.804
have his food in his bed, “I am very sorry, I am this and that.”

01:16:19.829 --> 01:16:22.687
His mother got fed up with him.

01:16:22.695 --> 01:16:25.396
Wife ran away, also he cried for that.

01:16:25.406 --> 01:16:27.702
His son ran away, he cried for that.

01:16:27.727 --> 01:16:30.529
The mother said that, “You cannot have all this nonsense”.

01:16:30.554 --> 01:16:33.262
So he cried for that, “She doesn’t love me.”

01:16:33.287 --> 01:16:37.202
And he came to Me, he said, “Mother I would like to wash your

01:16:37.226 --> 01:16:39.318
kitchen and do-.” I said, “You see,

01:16:39.334 --> 01:16:42.217
there is no need, I have got my own people here, staff,

01:16:42.242 --> 01:16:43.860
you don’t have to clean.

01:16:43.878 --> 01:16:46.522
Now will you please change your attitude towards life?”

01:16:46.531 --> 01:16:48.652
He said, “Mother I’ll try this, I’ll try that.”

01:16:48.676 --> 01:16:50.416
I gave him Realization, tried to.

01:16:50.424 --> 01:16:52.514
But he had these angles.

01:16:52.522 --> 01:16:54.691
I said all right. We sent him back to his mother.

01:16:54.716 --> 01:16:56.613
Three days later she rang me up. She said,

01:16:56.638 --> 01:16:59.502
“You please take your son away from me.

01:16:59.527 --> 01:17:01.008
I am fed up of him.

01:17:01.024 --> 01:17:03.446
He has come here, he is weeping in his bed as usual.

01:17:03.467 --> 01:17:06.196
He has gone back to the same, and he is doing no work.

01:17:06.221 --> 01:17:08.656
I have to cook for him, otherwise he starves himself.

01:17:08.680 --> 01:17:12.350
He thinks he is the most miserable man, you better have him.”

01:17:12.375 --> 01:17:15.148
You see this is the same style,

01:17:15.172 --> 01:17:17.889
you see, is the superego people, one style.

01:17:17.905 --> 01:17:20.907
And another one is the aggressive.

01:17:20.932 --> 01:17:24.189
Actually, the way aggressive people can become also people,

01:17:24.214 --> 01:17:26.651
because they are afraid of the ego.

01:17:26.676 --> 01:17:28.220
Like in England, I was surprised,

01:17:28.245 --> 01:17:32.157
people are very frightened, very frightened.

01:17:32.165 --> 01:17:34.129
Extremely frightened people.

01:17:34.154 --> 01:17:36.639
Indians are not like this.

01:17:36.664 --> 01:17:39.324
I mean if you need anything,

01:17:39.349 --> 01:17:42.102
you’d better telephone to them rather than go to their house.

01:17:42.127 --> 01:17:46.346
Otherwise, if you go and knock at their door, they might die of heart failure.

01:17:47.505 --> 01:17:50.261
They are so frightened, you see, most surprising.

01:17:50.286 --> 01:17:53.470
Extremely frightened people.

01:17:53.495 --> 01:17:57.737
And you cannot say anything to them. They just get like this.

01:17:57.762 --> 01:18:01.084
What are they frightened about? I don’t understand.

01:18:01.109 --> 01:18:03.975
Extremely frightened people they are.

01:18:04.007 --> 01:18:06.580
In India it is not so.

01:18:06.605 --> 01:18:10.011
In India, supposing somebody comes here tonight,

01:18:10.036 --> 01:18:12.103
immediately you think,

01:18:12.120 --> 01:18:15.495
 “Oh maybe your friend has come, he may be in difficulties”.

01:18:15.520 --> 01:18:17.552
Immediately the husband would ask the wife,

01:18:17.577 --> 01:18:19.707
 “You have sufficient money in the house? What have you got?

01:18:19.732 --> 01:18:22.318
Some ornaments? He might need some money.

01:18:22.343 --> 01:18:23.614
Otherwise why has he come?

01:18:23.639 --> 01:18:26.856
Or may be some problem with him.” It’s like that.

01:18:26.881 --> 01:18:29.874
You just open the door immediately, without thinking.

01:18:29.891 --> 01:18:33.284
And the thieves in India don’t knock at the door and come in.

01:18:38.266 --> 01:18:42.506
I mean, they are not expert burglars you see, as we have in England.

01:18:42.538 --> 01:18:44.550
They are naïve still.

01:18:44.558 --> 01:18:49.060
So their thieving also is mostly of no value.

01:18:49.085 --> 01:18:51.652
Actually, in my house, in my father’s house,

01:18:51.677 --> 01:18:53.561
we never locked our houses, never.

01:18:53.586 --> 01:18:56.109
All our doors were open, morning till evening.

01:18:56.117 --> 01:18:58.747
And father said, “If you lock the house then people will think,

01:18:58.772 --> 01:19:02.078
there’s something in the house, that’s why it is locked. Please keep in open.”

01:19:02.103 --> 01:19:04.789
We leave everything open and anybody can walk in.

01:19:04.814 --> 01:19:07.839
And in the night, mother fixed it. I mean, we were like that.

01:19:07.867 --> 01:19:11.913
But now we have learnt how to thieve and how to do things

01:19:11.938 --> 01:19:14.926
and that’s why the problem is different. All right.

01:19:14.927 --> 01:19:19.305
So, we have Christ in this place,

01:19:19.330 --> 01:19:25.674
where this red mark is, sitting at the crossing point.

01:19:26.179 --> 01:19:28.624
sitting at the crossing point.

01:19:28.632 --> 01:19:31.705
And this crossing point He has done for us.

01:19:31.715 --> 01:19:37.306
He has taken our karmas, the sins upon himself.

01:19:37.331 --> 01:19:39.595
The Hindus should now realize

01:19:39.612 --> 01:19:43.745
that they need not go about with their karma theory, before everyone.

01:19:44.608 --> 01:19:46.707
They do not want to talk of Christ,

01:19:46.732 --> 01:19:49.462
because they know their karma theory fails.

01:19:49.479 --> 01:19:53.365
If He has been sacrificed for our sins, either

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:56.897
He was a false guru or we are true gurus.

01:19:56.907 --> 01:19:59.710
Then how can we build up our karmas?

01:19:59.719 --> 01:20:05.240
If we become the Spirit all our karmas will be sucked by Christ

01:20:05.265 --> 01:20:08.267
who is awakened in that.

01:20:09.095 --> 01:20:11.326
So all the karma theories go away.

01:20:11.351 --> 01:20:13.407
All the sacrifices go away.

01:20:13.432 --> 01:20:16.077
All these ideas must go away.

01:20:16.102 --> 01:20:17.931
And when I talk about these things,

01:20:17.933 --> 01:20:20.161
Hindus blame Me that, “You are a Christian.”

01:20:20.186 --> 01:20:23.546
But when I talk about Krishna, the Christians say that,

01:20:23.571 --> 01:20:25.668
 “You are a Hindu.”

01:20:25.693 --> 01:20:29.209
Some say I am a Muslim, some say I am – what am I?

01:20:29.234 --> 01:20:30.736
I am a Musulman,

01:20:30.761 --> 01:20:34.352
because I know all of them are one, in one body,

01:20:34.367 --> 01:20:37.401
in one personality, they all exist.

01:20:37.426 --> 01:20:40.205
In one personality, in every human being,

01:20:40.222 --> 01:20:42.828
and no use disintegrating them

01:20:42.836 --> 01:20:46.108
and suffering the problems of disintegration.

01:20:46.133 --> 01:20:50.797
 “I am a Christian”, “I am a Muslim”, “I am a this”.

01:20:51.902 --> 01:20:54.237
You are that because you are born in that.

01:20:54.262 --> 01:20:56.183
Do you think about it?

01:20:56.208 --> 01:20:59.378
You accepted it just because you are born in it.

01:20:59.403 --> 01:21:03.174
What have you got? What did your forefathers get?

01:21:03.184 --> 01:21:05.821
All your people have been going to the same thing.

01:21:05.846 --> 01:21:08.521
You are a Hindu, you are doing like a Hindu rituals.

01:21:08.533 --> 01:21:10.636
If you are Christian you are doing like a Christian rituals.

01:21:10.661 --> 01:21:13.106
If you are a Muslim you are doing like a Muslim fanatic.

01:21:13.122 --> 01:21:17.085
It’s all that nonsense you have been doing for ages together.

01:21:17.100 --> 01:21:19.318
Did you get your Realization? It’s the first point.

01:21:19.343 --> 01:21:23.204
Even in the Gita, the first thing that is, that

01:21:23.229 --> 01:21:27.755
it’s through Veda, ‘Vid’ word means to know,

01:21:28.813 --> 01:21:31.378
and ‘Veda’ means  to know.

01:21:31.394 --> 01:21:33.867
and ‘Veda’ means by which you know.

01:21:33.884 --> 01:21:38.912
If these Vedas cannot make you know,

01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:41.550
then they are useless.

01:21:41.575 --> 01:21:44.949
They themselves have confessed it.

01:21:47.588 --> 01:21:53.588
So, we see here Christ, standing at the gate of three centers,

01:21:53.613 --> 01:21:59.821
three powers, Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Mahasaraswati.

01:21:59.833 --> 01:22:05.789
He is the one who’s is controlling all these three powers within us.

01:22:05.814 --> 01:22:09.873
By one power, He controls all our superegos,

01:22:09.898 --> 01:22:13.671
He controls all the devils and spirits.

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:17.828
If you show the cross the devils run away. It’s common.

01:22:18.427 --> 01:22:22.646
He controls our ego on the right-hand side.

01:22:22.666 --> 01:22:25.716
Though the Christians are the most ego oriented.

01:22:25.732 --> 01:22:31.792
Whatever they profess, they are just the opposite.

01:22:33.097 --> 01:22:38.284
And then He controls the dharma within us by which

01:22:38.300 --> 01:22:44.469
He makes us rise above towards spirituality, to be our Spirit.

01:22:44.494 --> 01:22:47.310
He controls that center within us.

01:22:47.327 --> 01:22:52.727
And this center is the center where your eyes get pure,

01:22:53.008 --> 01:22:57.671
that your superego at the back is clear,

01:22:58.806 --> 01:23:02.008
that your ego is sucked in,

01:23:02.025 --> 01:23:07.757
and from your eyes flows nothing but just compassion.

01:23:07.782 --> 01:23:11.859
Just compassion, and love of God

01:23:11.867 --> 01:23:16.569
and the devotees have adoration and nothing else.

01:23:17.978 --> 01:23:22.903
One lecture is not sufficient to describe Christ.

01:23:22.928 --> 01:23:28.870
Nor it is sufficient to describe Shri Krishna.

01:23:29.188 --> 01:23:33.897
I have spoken for hours, days together,

01:23:34.360 --> 01:23:36.791
and this lecture has taken too much time

01:23:36.799 --> 01:23:44.104
because I have tackled two very important centers together.

01:23:44.113 --> 01:23:48.235
I hope you will not sit on certain words

01:23:48.260 --> 01:23:54.306
or certain thoughts and just try to renounce the truth.

01:23:54.314 --> 01:23:56.362
This is the truth.

01:23:56.387 --> 01:23:59.112
I have come here to tell you the truth

01:23:59.124 --> 01:24:05.652
and not to please you, your ego, to please your ego,

01:24:05.804 --> 01:24:12.459
or to excite your superego, but to comfort you.

01:24:12.682 --> 01:24:17.058
And to make you your Self, your Spirit.

01:24:17.083 --> 01:24:19.410
May God bless you all.

01:24:29.774 --> 01:24:32.099
You have been asking too many questions.

01:24:32.124 --> 01:24:34.204
You’d better come and sit. All right?

01:24:34.229 --> 01:24:36.580
That will be better because you must be satisfied.

01:24:37.203 --> 01:24:42.848
All right? Just too many questions also, why?

01:24:42.873 --> 01:24:45.803
Just take it. First of all, get Realization.

01:24:45.828 --> 01:24:48.576
Get Realization. Did you read the book Advent?

01:24:48.602 --> 01:24:49.149
Seeker: Which one?

01:24:49.174 --> 01:24:50.347
Advent.

01:24:50.372 --> 01:24:52.771
Seeker: Advent. No, no.

01:24:52.780 --> 01:24:56.845
Sahaja Yogi: Any questions?

01:24:58.583 --> 01:25:07.191
Seeker:  After get realization can we go [UNCLEAR] cosmic consciousness.

01:25:07.203 --> 01:25:09.482
[UNCLEAR]

01:25:11.341 --> 01:25:13.476
What is cosmic? It’s not cosmic.

01:25:13.508 --> 01:25:17.449
Cosmic is has to something to do with your five elements.

01:25:17.475 --> 01:25:18.293
 Seeker: No –

01:25:18.318 --> 01:25:22.389
I know, just a minute. I will tell you. Sit down, sit down.

01:25:24.092 --> 01:25:28.500
You see cosmic consciousness is a consciousness

01:25:28.524 --> 01:25:33.490
which develops when you have interest in the matter.

01:25:34.706 --> 01:25:38.034
Cosmic consciousness, part of it, is shown now

01:25:38.059 --> 01:25:40.719
by your knowledge of science.

01:25:40.727 --> 01:25:43.292
This is the cosmos.

01:25:43.618 --> 01:25:47.137
The Spirit has nothing to do with the cosmos,

01:25:47.145 --> 01:25:57.666
in the sense, that this matter is just a lamp for the light.

01:25:59.084 --> 01:26:01.260
Light is the Spirit.

01:26:01.724 --> 01:26:06.960
The so-called cosmic consciousness is actually achieved

01:26:06.985 --> 01:26:11.406
by the movement of the mind to the right-hand side,

01:26:12.584 --> 01:26:16.256
which is the supraconscious area.

01:26:16.281 --> 01:26:20.053
In this movement, before Realization

01:26:20.077 --> 01:26:27.742
you are helped by people who are ‘busybodies’ [dead souls],

01:26:27.767 --> 01:26:29.992
 who are anxious people,

01:26:30.008 --> 01:26:33.089
who are lying on the right-hand side.

01:26:33.098 --> 01:26:35.895
Like you feel you are flying in the air,

01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:38.563
you are leaving your body, you are sitting on a tree.

01:26:38.587 --> 01:26:41.574
Or suddenly doze, some people know dozing,

01:26:41.599 --> 01:26:44.036
they know about the water, they know where the water is.

01:26:44.061 --> 01:26:48.691
All these suggestions come to you from the supraconscious area.

01:26:48.765 --> 01:26:54.173
Sometimes you start knowing about certain stars.

01:26:54.198 --> 01:26:59.068
There are supraconscious people in Columbia

01:26:59.093 --> 01:27:04.049
where women take this LSD and there are some drugs like that,

01:27:04.067 --> 01:27:06.603
if you take to it, you go into supraconscious area.

01:27:06.606 --> 01:27:09.433
You start seeing colours and formations.

01:27:09.442 --> 01:27:15.248
Beyond that also these people were so surprisingly supraconscious!

01:27:15.273 --> 01:27:21.111
You will be amazed that, I asked them,

01:27:23.847 --> 01:27:29.739
 “Why do you have an emblem as the condor, the big eagle.”

01:27:29.878 --> 01:27:35.795
They said that, “It is because our old Indians told us

01:27:35.811 --> 01:27:41.698
that once, it can be from India, God.

01:27:41.723 --> 01:27:45.023
God Vishnu came on a condor in this country”.

01:27:45.048 --> 01:27:48.987
 [UNCLEAR].

01:27:49.473 --> 01:27:55.248
So that kind of a development is not necessary now.

01:27:55.280 --> 01:27:57.355
That time is over.

01:27:59.188 --> 01:28:03.811
When people wanted to build up the right side,

01:28:05.092 --> 01:28:12.949
they tried to create their knowledge on the right side:

01:28:12.967 --> 01:28:18.971
like using prana, then using all these five elements, the Vedas and all that.

01:28:19.911 --> 01:28:25.255
Now you are developed, your ego is developed, all right.

01:28:25.280 --> 01:28:30.952
Now the time of development is such that you have to become the Spirit.

01:28:31.262 --> 01:28:34.552
You don’t have to, you don’t need it.

01:28:34.608 --> 01:28:37.603
By your knowledge of cosmic consciousness only,

01:28:37.628 --> 01:28:40.629
you discovered the ether,

01:28:40.654 --> 01:28:43.403
you discovered the gravity,

01:28:43.428 --> 01:28:46.524
you discovered so many things.

01:28:47.059 --> 01:28:49.807
Now all these things that you have discovered

01:28:49.832 --> 01:28:52.230
are going to help the Sahaja Yoga.

01:28:52.238 --> 01:28:54.763
It’s meant for this time.

01:28:54.780 --> 01:28:57.298
Like you make a stage:

01:28:57.306 --> 01:28:59.515
for the stage you put lights,

01:28:59.531 --> 01:29:02.716
you put all adjustments for sound, everything.

01:29:02.732 --> 01:29:06.655
But the people who have to be on the stage are you.

01:29:06.680 --> 01:29:09.493
Your job is to be on the stage.

01:29:09.510 --> 01:29:13.339
You are not to bother about the stage arrangements, that’s all done.

01:29:13.355 --> 01:29:15.723
That’s all finished.

01:29:15.748 --> 01:29:18.122
Now you see this mike,

01:29:18.147 --> 01:29:21.364
it is such a simple thing.

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.745
You know that this mike,

01:29:23.770 --> 01:29:29.292
on this magnetic emission,

01:29:29.308 --> 01:29:32.215
I can put the spiritual power to you,

01:29:32.240 --> 01:29:36.959
as I told you, it is the lamp that Christ the light.

01:29:36.967 --> 01:29:38.310
So this is the carrier.

01:29:38.335 --> 01:29:42.003
If I put it here like this, say I put it here,

01:29:42.519 --> 01:29:47.507
then I know that you can hear Me the same way as if you are hearing Me.
