00:19:10,225 --> 00:19:17,365
Shri Nirmala Devi namo namah

162
00:19:17,765 --> 00:19:24,605
[MUSIC]

163
00:19:25,305 --> 00:19:32,005
Shri Nirmala Devi namo namah

164
00:19:50,385 --> 00:19:53,585
[INAUDIBLE]

165
00:20:22,425 --> 00:20:27,005
I bow to all the seekers of truth.

166
00:20:31,245 --> 00:20:36,025
At the very outset we have to understand

167
00:20:37,585 --> 00:20:45,145
[ASIDE - NOT ALL RIGHT. DO YOU THINK THEY CAN HEAR ME? ITS NOT SO GOOD.]

168
00:21:10,985 --> 00:21:14,105
I'll give You another one Shri Mataji.

169
00:21:22,225 --> 00:21:26,045
Who's responsible for [INAUDIBLE -THIS?]?

170
00:21:33,065 --> 00:21:39,785
Just try [UNCLEAR] I think you have to [INAUDIBLE]

171
00:21:47,805 --> 00:21:50,805
[INAUDIBLE]

172
00:22:19,785 --> 00:22:23,085
[INAUDIBLE] in My hand

173
00:23:32,851 --> 00:23:38,551
One may ask a question - there have been so many saints, prophets, Incarnations

174
00:23:39,091 --> 00:23:46,711
on this earth and whatever they preached, whatever religion they started

175
00:23:48,551 --> 00:23:55,211
people would not keep to the teachings of these great people.

176
00:23:57,031 --> 00:24:02,791
All the teachings were absolutely to the point

177
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:11,051
according to the time they were facing, according to the contemporary problems they were facing.

178
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:18,911
But none of these have been able to keep the framework

179
00:24:19,371 --> 00:24:25,991
what they wanted to establish and all of them have deviated, without exception.

180
00:24:26,311 --> 00:24:32,591
Some are money oriented, some are power oriented, some are politics oriented,

181
00:24:33,111 --> 00:24:37,751
none of them are Spirit oriented - this very surprising.

182
00:24:40,371 --> 00:24:47,831
There came lots of philosophies, theories and deviations that people formed.

183
00:24:48,851 --> 00:24:54,571
Many religions out of one religion, many philosophies out of one.

184
00:24:58,031 --> 00:25:05,571
So people lost faith in religions also lost faith in God,

185
00:25:06,971 --> 00:25:11,311
lost faith in Divinity - they took to Science

186
00:25:12,411 --> 00:25:16,451
and what Science has given us, you know very well.

187
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:23,771
It has given up physical slavery to Science - complete slavery.

188
00:25:24,451 --> 00:25:31,851
We can't live without electricity, we can't live without plastic -

189
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:37,631
above all we have to live with Atomic bomb and Hydrogen bomb.

190
00:25:39,291 --> 00:25:44,731
This is what Science has done again to make compartments

191
00:25:49,831 --> 00:25:55,491
Also the artificial theories that came up in the West

192
00:25:55,771 --> 00:26:03,551
and in the East also - we have lots of intellectuals even in India - which is just a mental projection

193
00:26:04,691 --> 00:26:09,151
and this mental projection moves in a linear direction

194
00:26:09,671 --> 00:26:16,931
and again recoils back like boomeranging, the idea, the very idea which was projected.

195
00:26:18,691 --> 00:26:26,691
Thus we find confusion in these modern times that is one of the characters

196
00:26:27,751 --> 00:26:34,811
of the modern times that people will be confused. They will not know what is the truth, what is not the truth

197
00:26:35,691 --> 00:26:43,751
and then they'll groping for it and when they will be groping for it there will be many in the market, will be selling the truth.

198
00:26:48,671 --> 00:26:54,711
This all has happened already. Most of the sellers have been exposed

199
00:26:55,751 --> 00:27:02,751
and people have realized that there must be something more like an evolutionary process

200
00:27:03,451 --> 00:27:07,731
which is a living energy which works it out.

201
00:27:10,151 --> 00:27:15,891
So, we have reached the rational conclusion that there has to be something beyond

202
00:27:18,331 --> 00:27:26,311
to know the Truth which is Absolute. We don't live on a Absolute level - it's all relative.

203
00:27:27,211 --> 00:27:33,311
Some say communism is good, some say materialism is good, some say capitalism is good

204
00:27:33,771 --> 00:27:36,811
but everywhere you go to find it has failed.

205
00:27:37,491 --> 00:27:43,151
I've been now to all these countries who used to be such staunch believers of

206
00:27:43,531 --> 00:27:49,951
Communists, Communism and also democracy. So one is money-oriented,

207
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:54,091
another is power-oriented

208
00:27:57,031 --> 00:28:04,251
If you see the infrastructure of all these

209
00:28:05,971 --> 00:28:13,631
great philosophies put into our practice, you'll be amazed to see that it's all broken, finished

210
00:28:15,251 --> 00:28:20,831
and there's nothing that you could call as the Absolute Truth.

211
00:28:22,711 --> 00:28:28,551
All their political policies, economic policies , everything in a turmoil

212
00:28:28,791 --> 00:28:34,851
and it's nothing but experiencing on [UNCLEAR]. This experiencing

213
00:28:36,091 --> 00:28:42,331
works out against the very principle of what they wanted to do.

214
00:28:43,731 --> 00:28:51,571
That's how you find the fake gurus, that's why you find the people are so confused. Whatever they thought was absolutely right,

215
00:28:52,211 --> 00:28:58,911
has turned against them, so what is it that we have to do, where have we missed the point,

216
00:28:59,651 --> 00:29:02,771
where have all these religions have missed the point?

217
00:29:03,351 --> 00:29:09,451
You'll be amazed if you read about Christianity or Islam or Buddhism,

218
00:29:11,111 --> 00:29:19,111
Jainism, Sikhism, any of these things, you will be amazed the principles of all these are about the same

219
00:29:20,011 --> 00:29:24,931
and so beautiful. No rigidity,

220
00:29:25,771 --> 00:29:33,451
there is no fundamentalism, no chance of fundamentalism, encompassing everyone

221
00:29:34,851 --> 00:29:43,171
but the way people have become now - they're so antagonistic. They think they are the best, the rest are useless.

222
00:29:44,471 --> 00:29:51,711
How can any religion divide people? No respect for any knowledge

223
00:29:52,331 --> 00:30:00,371
neither any seeking. The second [UNCLEAR] as I told you - either it is the power or it is the money,

224
00:30:01,671 --> 00:30:05,751
nothing beyond that. Are we

225
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:15,071
just here for these temporary powers or

226
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:23,371
for this money which is already showing it's teeth to us?

227
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:27,891
What are we here for, what is the purpose of our life,

228
00:30:28,691 --> 00:30:34,671
why God has made us from amoeba to human stage, what was His mechanism,

229
00:30:36,831 --> 00:30:43,511
what was His desiring? If this is His mechanism, which He has very nicely built,

230
00:30:43,971 --> 00:30:51,251
nicely built on such a subtle level that we have to just feel it -

231
00:30:52,011 --> 00:30:59,351
this is all there. Now, when I'm talking to you, you should not take Me for granted because blind faith is not going to help you at all

232
00:30:59,931 --> 00:31:04,751
but should be treated as a hypothesis

233
00:31:05,251 --> 00:31:09,651
and should have a very scientific attitude of a very open mind.

234
00:31:10,551 --> 00:31:17,451
When you have that kind of a open mind, then you'll see that if it works, if

235
00:31:18,591 --> 00:31:24,971
you get connected with this All-Pervading power and a real yoga, the union takes place

236
00:31:25,311 --> 00:31:32,691
and you can feel it on your finger-tips, this All-Pervading power of God which is described in every,

237
00:31:33,171 --> 00:31:38,051
every scripture. You may call it by any name, doesn't matter.

238
00:31:38,571 --> 00:31:43,471
The seed is called by several names all over the world - seed remains seed.

239
00:31:44,951 --> 00:31:52,671
If you can feel that, then you are at that point of Absolute Truth. At this Absolute Truth

240
00:31:53,851 --> 00:32:00,251
you can never divide human beings because everybody knows the same truth,

241
00:32:01,331 --> 00:32:04,991
everybody achieving that truth within himself.

242
00:32:05,511 --> 00:32:11,291
The second thing which has failed our religions, our philosophies, our politics is that

243
00:32:12,271 --> 00:32:19,551
that whatever we believe be true or whatever we follow did not became an innate part and parcel of us -

244
00:32:20,451 --> 00:32:25,231
is outward. For example, I'd say about Christianity -

245
00:32:27,131 --> 00:32:35,071
Christ has said, "Thou shalt not have adulterous eyes." What a subtle sense of morality!

246
00:32:37,311 --> 00:32:43,071
Even the eyes should not be adulterous - there should be no lust and no greed in the eyes.

247
00:32:44,331 --> 00:32:48,371
If you find Christians, they are away from this.

248
00:32:49,631 --> 00:32:57,091
They have a brand. They have Christian brand, this brand, that brand. [UNCLEAR] Christ has said, "You're to be born again,"

249
00:32:58,211 --> 00:33:03,411
so they brand themselves, "We're born again." Just by branding you do not become that.

250
00:33:04,571 --> 00:33:10,391
You have to be what you are talking about.

251
00:33:11,311 --> 00:33:16,171
Whatever you talk, you have to walk the same way but that's not possible for human-beings.

252
00:33:17,471 --> 00:33:25,471
I've been with Mahatma Gandhi and he was a very great disciplined personality himself and he used to discipline others also.

253
00:33:26,411 --> 00:33:32,871
Tremendous disciplining he had and at that time, I found, the people

254
00:33:33,191 --> 00:33:40,051
become very disciplined, very righteous, very good - all kinds of things happened just when he, till he lived

255
00:33:40,471 --> 00:33:46,211
but when he died everything dropped down - nothing left there.

256
00:33:46,791 --> 00:33:51,511
Dropped down like a worn out coat, everything was thrown away.

257
00:33:52,291 --> 00:33:59,411
What was the reason? They believed that Gandhiji was very good, alright -

258
00:33:59,971 --> 00:34:06,191
they said they followed Mahatma Gandhi but they didn't imbibe anything that Mahatma Gandhi was saying.

259
00:34:06,771 --> 00:34:13,551
But it is not possible unless and until you are the Spirit, you do not have the power,

260
00:34:14,111 --> 00:34:21,691
you cannot bear even money, power, relationships, anything.

261
00:34:23,091 --> 00:34:28,591
It's something that is missing in human-beings. Until this missing point is there,

262
00:34:28,951 --> 00:34:32,971
we cannot reach what we are supposed to feel.

263
00:34:35,431 --> 00:34:43,451
And we are in Canberra and you must be knowing My husband has been a beaurocrat all his life and I've seen most of them.

264
00:34:44,251 --> 00:34:49,751
I have to tell them that there is a Kingdom of God into which we have to [UNCLEAR - ENTER?]

265
00:34:50,291 --> 00:34:55,271
then only we can change, then we can change

266
00:34:57,751 --> 00:35:04,691
everything that looks so confusing, everything that is all the time in the danger of being exposed,

267
00:35:05,351 --> 00:35:11,911
everything that we are afraid of because you really jump into that new awareness

268
00:35:12,631 --> 00:35:16,311
and in that new awareness, you see things very clearly.

269
00:35:18,891 --> 00:35:26,791
At the human level what do we do? We live either in the past or in the future -

270
00:35:27,811 --> 00:35:34,711
we cannot be in the present. At this moment you are not in the present just

271
00:35:37,031 --> 00:35:45,011
you stop listening to Me immediately some thought will come from your past or from your future like the waves,

272
00:35:45,571 --> 00:35:50,611
waves of the sea and you think you are be drowned in these waves -

273
00:35:50,891 --> 00:35:56,371
there are some thoughts which are very frightening, very few thoughts are there which really nourish you.

274
00:35:58,591 --> 00:36:06,511
But supposing, you get out of that and sit in a boat, then you can watch, you can watch all these thoughts

275
00:36:07,211 --> 00:36:14,471
without being in thought, that is you become thoughtlessly aware.

276
00:36:16,011 --> 00:36:23,011
You just watch these thoughts and watch your problems and supposing you learn how to swim, you can jump in

277
00:36:23,251 --> 00:36:29,991
and save many others and give them that life which you have achieved.

278
00:36:30,591 --> 00:36:38,351
But as a result of this, what you get is not the mundane thoughts but you become a master.

279
00:36:38,911 --> 00:36:45,611
If you want, you can think about it and then you'll be surprised, the revelation that you get.

280
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:50,351
The revelation about the problems that you have, the revelation

281
00:36:51,071 --> 00:36:55,451
about others, about yourself.

282
00:36:57,111 --> 00:37:04,711
This can only happen if this Kundalini rises within you and pierces through your fontanel bone area

283
00:37:06,091 --> 00:37:10,351
and you become one with this living force

284
00:37:11,031 --> 00:37:15,331
which we call as All-Pervading power of God's love.

285
00:37:15,591 --> 00:37:23,651
You can call it as Param Chaitanya, in Sanskrit it's called. Some call it Brahm Chaitanya, some call it Ruh - there are many names given to this.

286
00:37:26,291 --> 00:37:30,391
When we see these beautiful flowers here, we take them for granted.

287
00:37:31,611 --> 00:37:36,991
How do these flowers got their beautiful colors - from this Mother Earth,

288
00:37:38,351 --> 00:37:45,911
from a little bit seed that we had planted, how this Canberra has been

289
00:37:46,231 --> 00:37:52,951
enriched with such beautiful trees and flowers? We just take it for granted - who has done this?

290
00:37:53,751 --> 00:37:58,091
Who has made us from amoeba to this stage?

291
00:37:59,871 --> 00:38:07,011
Look at our eyes, what a camera it is! Look at our brain, what a computer! Who has programmed it?

292
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:13,611
We just take everything for granted but there is a power which is All-Pervading,

293
00:38:14,091 --> 00:38:17,211
which exists in each and every atom,

294
00:38:19,011 --> 00:38:24,671
which exists so close to us, works all the time

295
00:38:25,871 --> 00:38:31,391
but we are not aware of it. They say there is an Autonomous Nervous System within us

296
00:38:31,711 --> 00:38:38,131
which has got Sympathetic and Parasympathetic, two types of nervous systems

297
00:38:39,491 --> 00:38:44,131
but who is this Auto - just giving a name doesn't solve the problem.

298
00:38:45,371 --> 00:38:52,451
This Auto is the Spirit, is the Spirit which is the reflection of God Almighty.

299
00:38:53,171 --> 00:39:01,171
In those days of Science to talk about God also is criminal but He exists. Whether you like it or not, it can be proved.

300
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:05,631
It can be only proved when you become a realized soul,

301
00:39:06,711 --> 00:39:13,791
when you become an enlightened soul otherwise it cannot be proved.

302
00:39:14,391 --> 00:39:20,171
Just like supposing you take a leaf and show to someone and say there are lots of cells in it -

303
00:39:20,591 --> 00:39:27,811
unless and until you have a microscope, to see the subtle side of a leaf, you cannot convince anyone. In the same way,

304
00:39:28,191 --> 00:39:35,031
unless and until, you get your Self-realization you cannot, by no means

305
00:39:35,391 --> 00:39:42,811
you can achieve the proof of God, proof of Divinity, proof of Spirituality

306
00:39:43,271 --> 00:39:49,391
and you are all that, you are Divine, you are glorious within yourself.

307
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:55,691
All these powers are within you, this Kundalini is within you, all these chakras are within you

308
00:39:56,051 --> 00:40:03,591
and only thing is that you have to expand your awareness after your Self-realization.

309
00:40:05,071 --> 00:40:11,311
All these problems are your own so why not, why not we get it? If it's our own

310
00:40:12,491 --> 00:40:19,371
why not we have it? If we have a small little hut somewhere we will  fight with the courts, go all over the world to take it out.

311
00:40:19,551 --> 00:40:22,851
But what about the powers that you have within yourself?

312
00:40:24,511 --> 00:40:29,391
Such a lot of property that you have which will not only

313
00:40:29,931 --> 00:40:36,951
give you physical, mental, emotional, complete nourishment, complete balance

314
00:40:38,411 --> 00:40:44,071
but also the peace that is promised and the blessings.

315
00:40:45,011 --> 00:40:52,051
Above all you become a part and parcel of the whole -

316
00:40:52,451 --> 00:40:58,511
the microcosm becomes the macrocosm. You just become - it's the question of becoming.

317
00:40:58,771 --> 00:41:06,111
It's not just giving a lecture to you that this is this - claiming something but it has to happen - it's the actualization I'm talking about.

318
00:41:06,671 --> 00:41:13,231
The actualization of baptism that is to take place. It's not just certificate, it's not just like a [UNCLEAR - FLOWERISATION?].

319
00:41:13,591 --> 00:41:19,851
It has to work out innately within you and then all your innate qualities start showing

320
00:41:20,231 --> 00:41:25,771
It's a fact that by this Kundalini awakening blood cancer

321
00:41:26,031 --> 00:41:30,791
another type of cancer - so many diseases have been cured all over the world.

322
00:41:31,411 --> 00:41:36,991
We don't advertise it too much because that means all the time I'll be busy with the sick people only

323
00:41:37,251 --> 00:41:43,071
but it's better to create doctors out of you that you can heal, cure people.

324
00:41:43,631 --> 00:41:50,891
There're three doctors in Delhi [UNCLEAR - THEY LIVE IN?]  another capital like Canberra, where we have three doctors who have got

325
00:41:51,151 --> 00:41:55,491
their MD after doing MBBS in sahaja yoga

326
00:41:55,871 --> 00:42:02,111
to show, certain diseases they have shown which have been cured by sahaja yoga.

327
00:42:03,691 --> 00:42:10,231
Now this is not the only thing that you have to achieve, that you should just get your health

328
00:42:10,631 --> 00:42:17,391
alright, it's not the point. What you have to have is a complete command and understanding

329
00:42:17,771 --> 00:42:22,871
of the Divine laws and they should be innately enlightened within you.

330
00:42:23,751 --> 00:42:28,251
Then, you become righteous, righteous with love,

331
00:42:29,411 --> 00:42:35,971
you become a person who is your own, as if you are your own master.

332
00:42:36,751 --> 00:42:42,151
The guideline is the light of your Spirit and when the Spirit shines

333
00:42:43,751 --> 00:42:48,951
in your attention, then you become an enlightened person.

334
00:42:49,311 --> 00:42:54,671
It starts showing on your Central Nervous system, you can feel it on your finger-tips.

335
00:42:55,791 --> 00:43:03,391
There's cool breeze all over - cool breeze of the Holy Ghost they call it and also this is what you feel first time

336
00:43:03,711 --> 00:43:11,111
is the All-Pervading subtle power which you have never felt before. Then only thing you have to know, how to

337
00:43:11,831 --> 00:43:16,671
use this power for your benefit and for the benefit of others.

338
00:43:17,151 --> 00:43:22,831
And then you jump into another dimension which we call as Collective Consciousness.

339
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:30,471
The consciousness you have at the most about yourself - also that's not complete. Supposing somebody is getting a cancer, he's not conscious of it,

340
00:43:30,831 --> 00:43:37,911
supposing somebody is getting mad, he's not conscious of it but with this awareness, as soon as you get

341
00:43:38,191 --> 00:43:43,271
into some trouble, you get conscious of it because you're conscious of

342
00:43:43,591 --> 00:43:51,311
your centers which are on the Parasympathetic Nervous system. Doctors will admit honestly that they don't know anything about Parasympathetic

343
00:43:51,791 --> 00:43:55,991
but it is a realized soul who knows all about it

344
00:43:56,191 --> 00:44:01,591
and he has complete control over his Parasympathetic Nervous system which is the central path.

345
00:44:05,551 --> 00:44:10,331
So, this is a fulfilment of all the promises, this is a fulfilment

346
00:44:10,631 --> 00:44:17,871
of all the scriptures and fulfilment of all the theories that are political or economic [UNCLEAR - EVERYTHING?]]

347
00:44:18,311 --> 00:44:24,231
Now for example I would say, if I want the powers, I'm a Capitalist because I want the powers

348
00:44:24,571 --> 00:44:32,771
but I cannot exist with them, I have to distribute so I'm the greatest Communist - at this old age of Mine I'm going round the whole world

349
00:44:33,231 --> 00:44:40,031
travelling, travelling distributing it because I'm a Communist as well - I cannot enjoy them Myself.

350
00:44:41,631 --> 00:44:49,451
So, a personality which is developed, is the fulfilment of all our ideas which were running short of the Truth.

351
00:44:50,411 --> 00:44:58,151
The Truth was missing. That Truth has now show it, itself to you that you are in control of it.

352
00:44:58,791 --> 00:45:03,591
You know how to handle this power and how to give realizations to others.

353
00:45:04,991 --> 00:45:13,031
The Spirit, which is in your attention, is so powerful that a person who has reached

354
00:45:13,631 --> 00:45:20,771
a certain height of his development which we call as doubtless awareness, Nirvikalpa Samadhi -

355
00:45:21,051 --> 00:45:27,211
that state is achieved in no time - can sitting down here can tell you what's wrong with someone

356
00:45:27,591 --> 00:45:33,931
on the chakras. They talk the language of chakras not [UNCLEAR - OUT OF OR OUTER?] person wearing this dress or that dress

357
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:38,291
but language of the chakras - what's wrong with you, what's wrong with others.

358
00:45:39,711 --> 00:45:46,711
And if you know how somehow, somehow if you find out how to correct those things, you can correct people, you can correct yourself

359
00:45:47,591 --> 00:45:53,871
without feeling obliged or without feeling that you're obliging others.

360
00:45:54,271 --> 00:46:01,391
It just the thing that who is the other? If this finger is paining,

361
00:46:01,851 --> 00:46:07,231
if I look after it, after all the finger is not obliged to Me and I'm not obliged to finger.

362
00:46:07,451 --> 00:46:14,151
In the same way if you become a society of people who have brotherhood which is innate,

363
00:46:14,711 --> 00:46:22,071
a society of people who are morality which is innate, society of people which has got

364
00:46:23,611 --> 00:46:28,751
spirituality which is innate, then who is the other?

365
00:46:30,151 --> 00:46:36,511
We have such a society built in now. Sahaja yoga is now working in 55 nations, as they say,

366
00:46:37,051 --> 00:46:43,231
and we get people in India, once a year, from all kinds of countries -

367
00:46:43,751 --> 00:46:49,671
Russia, Bulgaria, Romania, Hungary, Poland on this side

368
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:57,031
also England, France, uh.. Spain, Italy, Switzerland

369
00:46:57,911 --> 00:47:04,231
America - North America, South America, Australia, Japan

370
00:47:04,891 --> 00:47:08,711
East, East Asian countries - from all over.

371
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:16,771
I've not been to most of them - Africa, South Africa but if you see them

372
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:24,151
such love, such understanding, such enjoyment of each other. There's no question

373
00:47:24,551 --> 00:47:29,891
of any quarrel or fights, such humour, such sweetness -

374
00:47:30,671 --> 00:47:38,691
it's really such a society has been already spontaneously formed. There are no rules and regulations,

375
00:47:38,951 --> 00:47:44,871
there's no compulsion but your Spirit. Spirit is the one which guides you and if everyone

376
00:47:45,851 --> 00:47:51,171
has the same reflection of the Spirit, there's not going to be any

377
00:47:51,751 --> 00:47:58,071
problem because everybody feels the same love. If you have ten children who are realized souls

378
00:47:58,551 --> 00:48:06,191
and if you tie a, a bandage on their eyes and ask them, "What's wrong with this gentleman?"

379
00:48:06,651 --> 00:48:13,491
they will all point out the same finger. Supposing they point out this finger, you ask that fellow, "Have you got bad, very bad,

380
00:48:13,731 --> 00:48:19,431
trouble with the throat?" "Yes, but how do you know?" "Because the children are showing the finger

381
00:48:19,731 --> 00:48:22,711
which indicates that this is the problem."

382
00:48:24,991 --> 00:48:31,611
So, there is no need to refer it to any uh.. sort of a specialist,

383
00:48:31,831 --> 00:48:36,851
everybody is a specialist - even the children know, even the children understand.

384
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:41,731
The other day we had a telephone, we had some sahaja yogi, sahaja yogi sitting there [UNCLEAR]

385
00:48:42,171 --> 00:48:49,031
I said, "Just receive that phone." He said, "Mother, there's somebody but he's not a yogi," finished. He put down the phone.

386
00:48:49,291 --> 00:48:56,191
They have told him, "You're not a yogi, first become a yogi, then tell him." Put down - came and told Me that "Mother, he's not a yogi."

387
00:48:59,651 --> 00:49:06,391
This is just building at your roots, just there - only thing you have to cope around.

388
00:49:06,951 --> 00:49:11,951
But we run after things which have advertising and all kinds of falsehood.

389
00:49:15,051 --> 00:49:22,071
One thing one should understand, you cannot sell it. How much did we pay to Mother Earth for these flowers,

390
00:49:22,591 --> 00:49:27,071
how much did we pay to saints,

391
00:49:27,851 --> 00:49:32,251
to great prophets, to Incarnations?

392
00:49:33,671 --> 00:49:39,591
It's a living process of your evolution and you can't pay for it

393
00:49:40,071 --> 00:49:47,871
but as soon as I say that people think it's something wrong in it because they don't understand anything for which you cannot pay.

394
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:56,591
It's a very surprising thing democracy, where people have so much of [UNCLEAR] so much talk of God.

395
00:49:57,091 --> 00:50:04,471
Every country has got a church or something there accepted as something final

396
00:50:05,731 --> 00:50:10,471
but none of them are seeking the truth.

397
00:50:11,691 --> 00:50:17,271
They're just comfortable with whatever they have, whatever they are doing.

398
00:50:17,571 --> 00:50:24,251
They're not understanding that this is done by their forefathers and their forefathers - what have they achieved?

399
00:50:24,871 --> 00:50:32,151
But now there's a special category of people, a very special category, which William Blake has called

400
00:50:32,471 --> 00:50:39,871
as people of God, "They will know God and they will make others know God."

401
00:50:40,871 --> 00:50:48,911
These are the people who are as seekers, they're [UNCLEAR - SCIENTISTS?] but so many are lost because of the falsehood

402
00:50:50,031 --> 00:50:57,971
that came in this world and people got enamored by it. Whatever it is, it is for us to decide

403
00:50:58,291 --> 00:51:03,731
what we have to achieve. There's so much to be told about it, so much

404
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:09,751
and you know, I must have given four five thousand lectures in only in English language and many other languages

405
00:51:10,491 --> 00:51:14,611
but this lecturing is just a

406
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:23,871
net of words 'Shabd Jaal'. It can only indicate that this is the Truth.

407
00:51:25,191 --> 00:51:30,851
but you have to go there - it's like a signboard. But if you just stand there and read the book

408
00:51:31,311 --> 00:51:34,651
and read the signboard all the time, you'll never reach there.

409
00:51:35,631 --> 00:51:41,391
You have to go and see for yourself. Reading about Australia, you don't go to Australia

410
00:51:42,951 --> 00:51:50,051
in the same way, by reading about anything or listening about it, you don't go there. And this is what it's not a mental feat

411
00:51:50,491 --> 00:51:58,271
it's beyond that - a evolutionary process by which you become the Spirit which is a very small little distance you have to cross

412
00:51:58,531 --> 00:52:02,871
which is your own, for which you cannot pay, is sahaja means spontaneous.

413
00:52:04,071 --> 00:52:11,831
You don't have to stand on your heads, you don't have to go to Himalaya, you don't have to do all these torturesome things and you don't have to [UNCLEAR],

414
00:52:13,091 --> 00:52:20,991
you have to enjoy and this is so simple, looks so fantastic - it is, it is very fantastic.

415
00:52:21,871 --> 00:52:28,871
See this now. This instrument was [UNCLEAR - STANDING?], everything was built but the connection was not there - it had no meaning.

416
00:52:29,531 --> 00:52:36,611
In the same way if you're not connected to the truth, you'll have no meaning. You're leading a life which is meaningless,

417
00:52:37,371 --> 00:52:44,591
which has no satisfaction, which has no fulfilment

418
00:52:45,751 --> 00:52:51,431
and it is innately built in you, is this pure power

419
00:52:51,871 --> 00:52:57,271
what you call the pure desire power of Kundalini which is your mother,

420
00:52:57,551 --> 00:53:01,151
which is an individual mother, she knows all about you.

421
00:53:03,571 --> 00:53:11,171
There are people who go on doubting all the time - it's easy to doubt but I would say that

422
00:53:11,451 --> 00:53:18,371
it's easier to get your Self-realization, why not we get it, what should be the objection?

423
00:53:21,571 --> 00:53:27,871
I hope, you will have wisdom to understand what I've said and you stick to your realization.

424
00:53:28,431 --> 00:53:33,291
Of course, I would like to have some questions from you because

425
00:53:33,871 --> 00:53:41,471
I do not want at the time when we are trying to ascend, your mind should just peep in and say, "Oh, you should have asked this question."

426
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,691
but I'd like you to ask Me some questions.

427
00:53:45,371 --> 00:53:51,951
Because there's complete freedom in sahaja yoga - you have to have Absolute Freedom and for that you have to have complete freedom.

428
00:53:56,151 --> 00:54:03,031
What's up? Still not alright? The connection is loose.

429
00:54:05,431 --> 00:54:08,371
[UNCLEAR N INAUDIBLE]

430
00:54:21,071 --> 00:54:26,351
Now, you have put it off. Hello Neeraj, he's put it off again.

431
00:54:27,811 --> 00:54:34,291
- [UNCLEAR]
 - It's alright.

432
00:54:35,551 --> 00:54:38,631
Interesting.

433
00:54:40,591 --> 00:54:46,691
[LAUGHTER] [UNCLEAR] Off [ALL LAUGH]

434
00:54:59,611 --> 00:55:05,891
No questions? ... that nourishes them, establishes them - the complete balance

435
00:55:06,191 --> 00:55:10,031
and then is connected with the mains and

436
00:55:10,431 --> 00:55:15,751
this energy then starts flowing through all the time.

437
00:55:20,591 --> 00:55:25,371
Homeopathic is alright in a way

438
00:55:26,451 --> 00:55:29,371
but I would say, that also is symptomatic.

439
00:55:30,271 --> 00:55:36,831
What is your symptom? You go to a homeopath, he'll ask you ten questions. I mean, sometimes you won't even know what to answer.

440
00:55:37,231 --> 00:55:43,951
Then he'll say that, "Alright, I'll give you this medicine, you try." Then suddenly you find boils coming out of your body

441
00:55:45,091 --> 00:55:49,551
so you say, now this has happened. He'll say, "No, no it's alright. It's coming out, is alright.

442
00:55:49,771 --> 00:55:54,571
Uh.. your antibodies have been activated and they're fighting it out."

443
00:55:56,531 --> 00:56:04,531
But in sahaja yoga it's not symptomatic. It's not from outside you treat but from inside

444
00:56:05,451 --> 00:56:09,831
in the sense that, when the Kundalini rises,

445
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:14,891
She passes through the centers, specially the center which we call as the Center heart.

446
00:56:16,431 --> 00:56:24,191
Center heart is the center which creates antibodies till the age of 12 years or so

447
00:56:24,811 --> 00:56:28,351
and then these antibodies are distributed in the whole body.

448
00:56:29,791 --> 00:56:34,991
Whenever you're afraid or when there's problem, there's attack from outside,

449
00:56:35,471 --> 00:56:42,231
then this sternum bone starts pulsating and it's a remote control and conveys the danger

450
00:56:43,531 --> 00:56:50,251
to these antibodies but here, you challenge the antibodies all the time.

451
00:56:50,551 --> 00:56:57,171
It's like giving a vaccination sort of a thing. When you challenge the antibodies, afterwards they get tired

452
00:56:58,591 --> 00:57:04,611
so that also system is not alright. Now instead of that, you must nourish the antibodies.

453
00:57:06,491 --> 00:57:11,831
That's what is done through sahaja yoga - they can become very strong, active.

454
00:57:12,371 --> 00:57:18,991
So many antibodies are killed by this but with sahaja yoga, they not only

455
00:57:19,811 --> 00:57:24,791
are nourished but they live very long and they have greater sense to fight the disease.

456
00:57:32,331 --> 00:57:35,851
In both these systems there's no talk of Spirit at all.

457
00:57:44,091 --> 00:57:47,131
It doesn't deal only with your physical side.

458
00:57:49,131 --> 00:57:53,811
Physical is not everything. I've met people who are uh.. very healthy people.

459
00:57:54,051 --> 00:57:57,291
They have come to Me saying that, "Mother, we want peace."

460
00:58:00,571 --> 00:58:07,071
Some people say, "I don't know how to love." Specially people who are over healthy uh..do not know how to love others,

461
00:58:07,771 --> 00:58:14,271
to have compassion. Mostly people who do Hatha yoga for physical upliftment

462
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:20,931
or who jog also, they become very dry, extremely dry and end up with a divorce or something.

463
00:58:21,771 --> 00:58:28,171
So only one-sided development is not good - we are not only physical beings. We are mental beings,

464
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:32,871
above all we are Spiritual beings so we have to have a balance.

465
00:58:44,611 --> 00:58:51,291
[INAUDIBLE]

466
00:58:51,531 --> 00:58:55,451
[INAUDIBLE]

467
00:58:58,251 --> 00:59:05,631
[INAUDIBLE] She says she doesn't know anything about sahaja yoga, how many attempts would be necessary to?

468
00:59:05,951 --> 00:59:11,651
Oh, it's good. No, no, not many attempts are needed only just now

469
00:59:11,891 --> 00:59:18,351
you'll be awakened. I'm sure you all will be awakened this evening. We have a center here,

470
00:59:19,171 --> 00:59:25,131
very good center, we are very senior sahaja yogies, in the sense they may not be in age but in knowledge

471
00:59:25,491 --> 00:59:33,511
and they'll tell you all about it, absolutely free. It's not like this that first lecture is free and the rest is all [UNCLEAR -LYNCHING?] - it's not like that.

472
00:59:34,371 --> 00:59:42,211
But you have to give some time to yourself, you have to respect yourself and your Self-realization. What happens, people get their Self-realization

473
00:59:42,451 --> 00:59:47,931
and after that they are like just sprouted beans - finished. So you have to grow.

474
00:59:48,351 --> 00:59:56,251
It's very easy to understand, it's so simple and they'll manage it for you, you must just listen to them, practice it

475
00:59:56,691 --> 01:00:02,431
and you'll be amazed it's such a miraculous thing, it's such a miraculous thing

476
01:00:02,771 --> 01:00:06,271
and so many things happen unbelievable.

477
01:00:07,391 --> 01:00:13,631
You're all the time under protection, you're looked after materially also,

478
01:00:15,211 --> 01:00:19,471
familywise, in every way - it's another world you enter into.

479
01:00:25,071 --> 01:00:34,011
[INAUDIBLE]

480
01:00:37,971 --> 01:00:46,011
[INAUDIBLE] Some organizations like TM charge money but sahaja yoga doesn't, why is this possible?

481
01:00:46,811 --> 01:00:54,411
Hunh! TM - better not say anything about horrible thing like TM, I mean, you are asked Me, I have to tell you.

482
01:00:55,331 --> 01:00:59,911
Actually, I come across it long time back

483
01:01:00,571 --> 01:01:07,511
when a gentleman called Peter Pears who was running the flying academy in Runnock

484
01:01:09,611 --> 01:01:14,831
and I don't know, people are so silly that they join this academy.

485
01:01:15,451 --> 01:01:18,491
Then he brought many TM people to Me and

486
01:01:18,991 --> 01:01:24,491
they were all in a mess, absolutely in a mess. This fellow had epilepsy, his wife had epilepsy

487
01:01:24,751 --> 01:01:30,711
and his director - they have big, big names - director, deputy director, president, this, that

488
01:01:31,091 --> 01:01:37,851
and Mr. Director also had epilepsy and the little girl she too has had epilepsy.

489
01:01:38,291 --> 01:01:43,431
Luckily in those days My husband had gone on leave

490
01:01:43,831 --> 01:01:48,391
so I asked them, "Come and settle down in My house, I'll work it out." Very difficult days!

491
01:01:49,131 --> 01:01:56,771
I worked it out, ofcourse, they got their realization and epilepsy went away. They had become completely bankrupt

492
01:01:57,071 --> 01:02:05,151
because TM was taking all the money in Switzerland and sending all the students there to learn how to jump, I mean, to, to be

493
01:02:05,471 --> 01:02:10,311
uh.. what you call, levitate - absurd.

494
01:02:12,371 --> 01:02:19,311
Why do people want to levitate, I don't know what is the need? Already we have problems

495
01:02:19,631 --> 01:02:24,891
with our traffic [LAUGHTER]

496
01:02:25,451 --> 01:02:31,131
Think of people levitating half-way, I mean, really it's stupidity, nothing but stupidity.

497
01:02:32,611 --> 01:02:36,791
And then this gentleman told Me all the story about TM.

498
01:02:37,031 --> 01:02:41,191
I was shocked, I mean, how could people take to such a nonsense!

499
01:02:42,171 --> 01:02:47,091
First of all he told Me that they called him that they will give him a mantra, all of them

500
01:02:47,471 --> 01:02:53,931
and these mantras were given by somebody who was sitting there, specially this guru of theirs, they called him giggly guru.

501
01:02:54,271 --> 01:03:02,091
Used to giggle must be giggling because that must be thinking how stupid these people are! [LAUGHTER]

502
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:08,431
I mean naturally - and he would give them a, a mantra.

503
01:03:09,211 --> 01:03:16,011
Now, if there are Indians they'll understand, and very in great secrecy. You see, you had to give them flowers, this, that, I don't know.

504
01:03:16,251 --> 01:03:21,371
And they had to pay three hundred pounds beforehand before entering into that room.

505
01:03:21,751 --> 01:03:28,491
And this guru would give them a mantra which was 'Inga', 'Pinga' and 'Thinga' - now Indians  know, understand.

506
01:03:28,831 --> 01:03:33,311
And you are not supposed to tell anybody about it. He didn't even know Sanskrit, can you imagine!

507
01:03:33,731 --> 01:03:39,931
Now 'Inga' means what - 'Inga' means the bite of a scorpion, in a local language.

508
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:47,051
'Pinga' means when a person gets a spirit he goes round and round -'Pinga' and 'Thinga' is when you show it somebody like this.

509
01:03:47,331 --> 01:03:54,071
[LAUGHTER] And they paid three hundred pounds for that. [LAUGHTER]

510
01:03:55,591 --> 01:04:01,271
Then the second course started, people got very sick with that - they pained and all that.

511
01:04:01,531 --> 01:04:07,371
So many, even bureaucrats from India, went into that nonsense - that painful time.

512
01:04:08,651 --> 01:04:13,131
Then they did another course that is of levitation.

513
01:04:14,411 --> 01:04:20,251
So they told Me there's a barrister, a Jew lady, she told Me how she suffered.

514
01:04:22,191 --> 01:04:27,251
They were all asked to go to Switzerland in a very remote hotel

515
01:04:28,171 --> 01:04:35,491
and they had to pay six thousand pounds for that course, apart from travelling and all that

516
01:04:36,611 --> 01:04:43,711
and there were uh... what you call, foams,

517
01:04:44,251 --> 01:04:51,891
foams kept about one foot high and they were asked to jump on it. The course was for seven days

518
01:04:52,511 --> 01:04:59,111
and for five days they had to drink the water which had boiled the potatoes

519
01:05:00,171 --> 01:05:07,671
and the sixth day they had to eat the rind of the potatoes and the seventh day they were given the potatoes -

520
01:05:08,491 --> 01:05:12,471
for six thousand pounds [LAUGHTER]

521
01:05:14,171 --> 01:05:19,431
It's a fact, I tell you, it's a fact and stupidly they did it!

522
01:05:20,291 --> 01:05:27,551
And they jumped on these things and broke all their bottoms and they, you know, there was a case in America against them

523
01:05:28,531 --> 01:05:34,811
and when they and they're very good at money because after all if you earn money like this, you see,

524
01:05:35,351 --> 01:05:39,111
and they claimed  money, they gave the money - hushed out.

525
01:05:40,451 --> 01:05:48,171
And also very criminal - they tried to kill this Peter Pears. They threw him out of the train one day somebody.

526
01:05:49,371 --> 01:05:54,351
So, they are good at advertising;  Every time they start a new stuff.

527
01:05:54,611 --> 01:05:58,451
This time they have started, say Ayurveda - for Ayurveda, why do you need TM?

528
01:06:00,371 --> 01:06:07,411
Ayurveda cannot work out in the West because the uh.. medicines and all that are made

529
01:06:08,271 --> 01:06:16,231
in the fields of India. Unless and until they are made into pills and things, they cannot be used but for that you don't need TM.

530
01:06:17,791 --> 01:06:25,831
If you want to do Ayurveda, is better that you get directly from some Ayurvedic society something but why to have this TM in between?

531
01:06:26,951 --> 01:06:34,551
And talking that you become very dynamic. In the beginning, you see, it's all what we call is as Shamshan Vidya, is the

532
01:06:34,811 --> 01:06:41,031
uh... Spirits they use. So if you put a, if you put a Spirit on somebody

533
01:06:41,551 --> 01:06:48,771
that person is so ambitious, the Spirit itself, and then this person ambitious, they become very ambitious, both of them.

534
01:06:49,191 --> 01:06:55,371
But a horse on which two persons are sitting, that horse becomes absolutely tired after sometime, though it runs fast.

535
01:06:56,991 --> 01:07:05,011
And then they are recluses - there are so many recluses in TM. They have no money, they have taken out their children from schools.

536
01:07:05,751 --> 01:07:12,951
I mean, it's true they charge lot of money, I've already told you. But sahaja yoga has nothing to do with this kind of a nonsense absolutely.

537
01:07:13,971 --> 01:07:21,951
All those people, have already told you, taking money from you, in the name of consciousness, awareness, are all cheats, take it from Me, all of them.

538
01:07:22,831 --> 01:07:29,311
But still is on. You know about Rajneesh how he was but still, in Australia, you find so many

539
01:07:29,551 --> 01:07:37,291
disciples of Rajneesh still going mad. They are all suffering so much all from so many troubles - very painful diseases they have

540
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:44,111
but what to do? They don't want to come to truth - some sort of a mania if it is.

541
01:07:44,771 --> 01:07:50,771
I asked people that why do you want to pay, he said, "Then you're sure that there's something we'll achieve."

542
01:07:51,051 --> 01:07:56,391
But I said, "How are you sure? Because you're paying for it, because there's a commitment."

543
01:07:56,671 --> 01:08:03,731
I said, "How much will you pay for your Self-realization, it is so invaluable, how much?"

544
01:08:05,891 --> 01:08:12,351
We should use our brains but surprisingly, most of the bureaucrats are in it, in this team.

545
01:08:14,131 --> 01:08:21,071
And there are some people who are paid money to give advertisement, like this Peter Pears, was told to say that

546
01:08:21,631 --> 01:08:27,911
he was sitting there and he was meditating, suddenly he passed through the wall. But I said, "Why did you tell a lie?"

547
01:08:28,171 --> 01:08:36,271
He said, "I told more lies." "What?" He said I told them, "I came to America without a passport, without anything, just through this levitation."

548
01:08:36,491 --> 01:08:42,031
But I said, "Why did you tell such lies?" He said, "He was a very rich diamond merchant

549
01:08:42,231 --> 01:08:47,871
and all the money was involved into this. When I got into it completely upto this much

550
01:08:48,111 --> 01:08:53,431
then this guruji told me that if you don't tell lies, how will you recover your money - you have to tell lies."

551
01:08:56,431 --> 01:09:01,951
Just imagine, you just go to America sitting down here - and people believe it.

552
01:09:02,891 --> 01:09:07,671
And they advertise with these people. They pay them and ask them to write such things.

553
01:09:08,931 --> 01:09:12,231
Why? It's all money-making.

554
01:09:15,231 --> 01:09:22,411
But I don't know the credibility of this man, especially in India. My husband has been a bureaucrat, a well known bureaucrat, he has so many awards

555
01:09:22,711 --> 01:09:28,631
I think, he has got the maximum number of awards uh.. from all the nations

556
01:09:28,771 --> 01:09:34,451
he's, I mean, in the who's who it's written that he's the man who has been awarded the most.

557
01:09:35,411 --> 01:09:41,711
They won't trust Me, they will trust this man who was just a ticket collector once upon a time.

558
01:09:43,411 --> 01:09:46,471
Can you imagine?

559
01:09:50,931 --> 01:09:56,271
Whole thing is such a fraud but people like it

560
01:09:57,171 --> 01:10:01,131
and you have freedom to waste your money where ever you feel like - you can't help it.

561
01:10:04,911 --> 01:10:10,671
It's a fact. This man is writing a book now, Peter Pears, but he still has problems.

562
01:10:10,931 --> 01:10:15,831
Suffered a lot, suffered a lot, this man, he's become a bankrupt and he had to go to South Africa.

563
01:10:19,931 --> 01:10:27,951
Because you have asked Me, I've told you otherwise no use describing these horrible things to you - makes the whole atmosphere bad.

564
01:10:29,331 --> 01:10:36,531
Just think, just think of something nice. Any other question, please?

565
01:11:13,271 --> 01:11:16,471
Buddha has described

566
01:11:19,591 --> 01:11:25,551
I don't know if you have read about Buddhism, even the Buddhist don't read.

567
01:11:25,991 --> 01:11:33,171
He said that when Buddha will come,  the future Buddha, he's [UNCLEAR] Matreya, means the Three Mothers  put together - Matreya,

568
01:11:34,411 --> 01:11:41,871
when Buddhism will come, to it's future state, then there will be Bodhisattwa

569
01:11:42,431 --> 01:11:47,891
means the persons will get their realization, they'll become Buddhas but it won't be individual,

570
01:11:48,131 --> 01:11:55,971
it won't be through hardships and all that but they'll get it, their realization and then that will be put to the use of the people,

571
01:11:56,891 --> 01:12:03,851
to the use of the public and also for the use of solving the multiple problems.

572
01:12:04,271 --> 01:12:11,491
All these problems can be solved through sahaja yoga. Ecological problem can be solved only through transformation of beings

573
01:12:12,271 --> 01:12:19,771
because it's human-beings who have brought this. Once they're transformed, all the problems they have created, can be solved.

574
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:28,031
So you have to give it and it's most enjoyable thing is to give realization to others -

575
01:12:28,471 --> 01:12:31,311
greatest enjoyment in doing that.

576
01:12:35,791 --> 01:12:41,651
Yes please. [INAUDIBLE]

577
01:12:42,211 --> 01:12:48,231
- Do animals have chakras and Kundalini?
- Yes, yes they have but not so developed as you have.

578
01:12:48,791 --> 01:12:55,451
We have a very good uh... system which is completely sorted out

579
01:12:55,731 --> 01:13:00,751
This is a deep subject but the brain of a man is like a prism

580
01:13:01,031 --> 01:13:06,151
and because of that whatever energy falls on this brain

581
01:13:06,951 --> 01:13:12,171
is, goes into refraction

582
01:13:12,571 --> 01:13:19,191
and because of refraction we have a clear cut three systems built-in within us -

583
01:13:19,531 --> 01:13:22,831
two sympathetic, left and right and the Parasympathetic

584
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:31,471
and so it's a very systematically sorted out. Like in our evolutionary process we used to have say,

585
01:13:32,011 --> 01:13:40,051
lights, electricity in a very different manner. Gradually it is improving, improvement and today it's in a very

586
01:13:41,051 --> 01:13:48,311
great state of evolution. In the same way, we have been born

587
01:13:50,051 --> 01:13:55,851
in such a manner that it is very suitable for our evolution

588
01:13:56,251 --> 01:14:03,311
but animals also evolve, animals are also evolving. These days when you see all kinds of poor people,

589
01:14:03,551 --> 01:14:10,011
all kinds of uh.. people who have no feelings for others - they must be coming from some

590
01:14:10,231 --> 01:14:17,111
hyaena group or something like that otherwise how can they be without any heart, without any love -

591
01:14:18,091 --> 01:14:23,931
so dry. So they are also evolving.

592
01:14:28,491 --> 01:14:35,231
We have already evolved, we have reached. We are at the end of, epitome of the evolution, we are at the top

593
01:14:35,451 --> 01:14:38,671
you have to just jump a little more and that's what it is.

594
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:44,931
That's why human-beings must be respected the most, much more than animals or anyone else.

595
01:14:52,331 --> 01:14:58,671
Alright, I think we have had quite a lot of questions and also you'll be satisfied.

596
01:14:58,931 --> 01:15:05,611
Later on whenever you want to know about it, you can write to Me or you can write to these people but in any case I hope

597
01:15:06,791 --> 01:15:09,891
after realization you will not give it up

598
01:15:11,031 --> 01:15:17,411
and just [UNCLEAR - TAKE TO IT?] because we do not take money from you and that's why [UNCLEAR - LET'S NOT?] involve it

599
01:15:18,851 --> 01:15:23,271
but as you know there are still problems within us.

600
01:15:23,611 --> 01:15:30,671
The Kundalini passes through a very subtle, small, central channel - we call it as Brahma Nadi

601
01:15:31,031 --> 01:15:35,451
and She opens up, no doubt but the connection is not complete -

602
01:15:36,291 --> 01:15:41,671
sometimes it goes down to various places. Supposing, you have a liver trouble, it will go down to liver trouble,

603
01:15:41,931 --> 01:15:49,191
to other mental trouble or any kind of a trouble like spiritual trouble can come if you have done like TM or anything.

604
01:15:49,731 --> 01:15:55,291
If such a thing has happened, then this Kundalini goes to those places and works it out.

605
01:15:55,491 --> 01:16:01,471
Now what you have to know, is a very simple thing, is that how do we cleanse ourselves.

606
01:16:02,331 --> 01:16:08,651
We don't go to Himalayas, we don't go fasting, we don't give up our families - nothing of the kind.

607
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:13,771
We are where we are. We are not to give up any place, any position, anything .

608
01:16:14,111 --> 01:16:21,231
And to develop within, what is the solution? The solution is that you have to go to the collective

609
01:16:22,991 --> 01:16:30,791
without feeling what is your position in life, forgetting all that. We don't have elaborate ashrams and all that because we don't make money.

610
01:16:31,111 --> 01:16:37,351
It's a humble place. Whatever it is, with humility you must go there, with the collective you have to be.

611
01:16:38,071 --> 01:16:44,091
And if you are humble, if you go to the collective, you'll not only

612
01:16:44,711 --> 01:16:50,191
know about sahaja yoga but also you'll grow very fast and the cleansing takes place.

613
01:16:50,431 --> 01:16:57,431
Without the collective, cleansing doesn't take place. That's the only way you can cleanse and you can master it.

614
01:16:58,331 --> 01:17:02,491
For that you don't have to pay, nothing of the kind.

615
01:17:06,411 --> 01:17:12,111
If you find any discrepancies, you should write to Me - everybody is free to write.

616
01:17:16,691 --> 01:17:21,751
Because that's how you're purified without any problems, without any [UNCLEAR - DIFFERENCE OR DIFFICULTIES?]

617
01:17:22,191 --> 01:17:29,431
Also a kind of a individual meditation has to be done, which they will tell you - five minutes in the morning, ten minutes in the evening.

618
01:17:29,651 --> 01:17:35,571
It's not done but you become, you are in meditation for five minutes and ten minutes in the night

619
01:17:35,971 --> 01:17:43,531
that cleanses you but collective is very important. In the collective to absorb the vibrations

620
01:17:43,951 --> 01:17:51,431
uh.. what you call, this Chaitanya, this Divine power - in the collective and it cleanses you.

621
01:17:52,351 --> 01:17:57,871
Such a different thing to be in Collective and you'll be amazed how it will work out.

622
01:18:00,171 --> 01:18:05,131
But that has to be promised that you will have to do the collective.

623
01:18:06,131 --> 01:18:11,651
There's no commitment if you want to give realization, you can give, if you don't want to give doesn't matter,

624
01:18:12,011 --> 01:18:18,511
if you want to evolve yourself, you can evolve yourself but you will feel that because the compassion

625
01:18:21,511 --> 01:18:28,351
and you get concerned about your surroundings, you get concerned about people.

626
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:36,051
It's a personality that develops uh.. which is so full of love, full of feelings

627
01:18:36,391 --> 01:18:40,691
and strength and knowledge so what to do it, you don't want to waste it.

628
01:18:41,751 --> 01:18:49,171
I never force anyone to do anything nor will you forced to do anything whatever you want to do, you get it, you can do it

629
01:18:49,391 --> 01:18:53,391
but you have to be in the collective, that's very important.

630
01:18:58,371 --> 01:19:04,611
[UNCLEAR] civil to be because no use watching others

631
01:19:04,851 --> 01:19:12,791
because that creates problems for others. If you want to have realization, then you're welcome and you should get it.

632
01:19:13,891 --> 01:19:17,591
The second condition is very simple again

633
01:19:19,451 --> 01:19:22,451
that you're not to feel guilty about anything.

634
01:19:22,791 --> 01:19:26,791
Past is past is finished now, at this moment you are in the present.

635
01:19:27,371 --> 01:19:34,711
To a mother a child is never guilty so please, take away the guilt if there is anything in your head

636
01:19:35,111 --> 01:19:39,231
because also I think, English language has too much of this - sorry, sorry, sorry.

637
01:19:39,431 --> 01:19:45,291
Formerly when we were young, we used to say, I beg your pardon before, now they say sorry - everything is sorry.

638
01:19:45,511 --> 01:19:51,151
What is there to be sorry about? You have to be happy, joyous - so not to feel guilty at all,

639
01:19:51,951 --> 01:19:59,411
not to blame yourself for anything, please - you are not at all guilty about anything.

640
01:20:00,351 --> 01:20:05,691
Small, small things we talk of which makes us guilty

641
01:20:05,991 --> 01:20:13,191
also these religious teachings, so called, that you are a sinner, you're this, you pay so much money - nothing of the kind.

642
01:20:13,771 --> 01:20:20,751
In sahaja yoga first thing you must know you are a human-being, you are a seeker that's why you're here and you're not guilty.

643
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:25,911
Even if you have done mistakes, if you have gone to wrong places, doesn't matter we can correct it

644
01:20:26,551 --> 01:20:32,331
but don't feel guilty about it that, "I went to this place, I did this, I did that." It  will automatically work out

645
01:20:33,371 --> 01:20:40,251
and you'll be surprised to see your own growth. You should not condemn yourself for anything at all -

646
01:20:40,991 --> 01:20:46,991
this is first condition. Then the second condition is

647
01:20:48,751 --> 01:20:52,751
that you have to forgive everyone, in general.

648
01:20:53,771 --> 01:20:58,551
Whether you forgive or don't forgive, you don't do anything - what do you do, nothing.

649
01:20:59,711 --> 01:21:07,691
But when you don't forgive then you play into wrong hands. Those who have tortured you are very happy people while you are bothering yourself too much.

650
01:21:10,571 --> 01:21:17,731
So, you have to forgive - in general means that you don't have to think of these things which have hurt you

651
01:21:17,971 --> 01:21:25,511
or the people who have hurt you but in general you should say, "I forgive everyone." You'll feel much lighter even now - you forgive everyone.

652
01:21:27,731 --> 01:21:33,511
That means, in short, that you must be very pleasantly placed towards yourself that you are a human-being,

653
01:21:34,291 --> 01:21:42,351
that you have every right, your birth-right to get this yoga, to get this union with the Divine, there's Divinity within you which has to rise.

654
01:21:44,391 --> 01:21:52,511
If you just understand that it is your birthright as human-being and as a human-being you are at the epitome of evolution

655
01:21:54,051 --> 01:21:58,211
be happy about it, be pleasantly placed towards yourself

656
01:21:58,891 --> 01:22:04,191
do not to condemn yourself for anything that you have done in the past - forget it.

657
01:22:04,571 --> 01:22:10,651
Your mother is Kundalini, knows everything about you and She knows how to manage the way through it.

658
01:22:11,771 --> 01:22:18,091
She has recorded everything within Herself like a tape recorder so you don't have to worry, you don't judge yourself.

659
01:22:19,111 --> 01:22:24,111
She will know how to manage, She's so anxious to give this re-birth.

660
01:22:28,171 --> 01:22:36,171
These are very simple conditions which may look difficult to some people - is not, is just a mental idea.

661
01:22:38,191 --> 01:22:44,811
Forget it. You have to love yourself as I love you, that's the point

662
01:22:46,971 --> 01:22:51,371
and respect, very important because you're seekers.

663
01:22:51,791 --> 01:22:57,391
You're seekers of truth and that's why you're much higher than the rest of the world.

664
01:23:01,571 --> 01:23:05,891
Now there's one more thing which should not upset you that we have to take out our shoes

665
01:23:06,151 --> 01:23:10,911
uh.. whether you're sitting on the ground or on the chair because it's better

666
01:23:12,211 --> 01:23:15,291
that uh.. we touch the Mother Earth with our feet.

667
01:23:15,951 --> 01:23:21,271
Mother Earth sucks, sucks in any negative [UNCLEAR - WANTS OR FORMS?] that are within us, just.

668
01:23:24,151 --> 01:23:28,271
Also if you have anything very tight in the neck or on the waist, you can just loosen it little bit.

669
01:23:29,091 --> 01:23:34,751
So, you should be comfortable. Imagine, sitting on the chair you're going to get your Self-realization! Comfortable.

670
01:23:35,311 --> 01:23:43,571
Don't have to go to Himalayas to stand on your head for 10 years - just here, within ten minutes you're going to get your Self-realization.

671
01:23:56,251 --> 01:23:59,211
First we'll show you

672
01:23:59,851 --> 01:24:07,391
and you will nourish your own centers. This is for only once you have to know later on there's no need at all. After Self-realization

673
01:24:07,631 --> 01:24:14,311
they'll tell you how to raise your Kundalini yourself, how to make the connection alright but in the beginning I will just tell you.

674
01:24:18,071 --> 01:24:24,951
Now the left side of the Left Sympathetic is the power of desire, of ordinary desire not pure desire -

675
01:24:25,911 --> 01:24:33,371
pure desire is the Kundalini - and the right side is the power of action so we put the left hand, like this, on our lap,

676
01:24:33,731 --> 01:24:38,751
very comfortably - you have to sit not too much straight,

677
01:24:39,331 --> 01:24:43,491
bending back or slouching but in a normal straight manner.

678
01:24:44,471 --> 01:24:47,411
Please put the left hand, like this, on your lap

679
01:24:48,691 --> 01:24:54,131
and have full confidence. This is one of the most important thing is to have full confidence in yourself

680
01:24:54,591 --> 01:24:58,011
that you are going to get realization - no doubt.

681
01:25:00,771 --> 01:25:04,251
Now the right hand we'll use for nourishing our centers.

682
01:25:05,511 --> 01:25:13,071
The first thing is the Spirit which resides in the heart so we put our right hand on our heart, is the Spirit.

683
01:25:14,071 --> 01:25:19,531
If you're wearing a coat, you can put inside the coat on the right hand.

684
01:25:27,871 --> 01:25:31,271
Now, if you're the Spirit, you become your own master

685
01:25:32,491 --> 01:25:40,271
so the center for your mastery is on the left-hand side of your stomach or you can call abdomen on the upper side.

686
01:25:42,011 --> 01:25:49,991
We're working only on the left-hand side. In the upper portion of your abdomen on the left hand side, you put your fingers and press it a little.

687
01:25:51,271 --> 01:25:59,351
This is the center of your mastery - this is created by great masters, prophets, which is to be enlightened.

688
01:26:04,471 --> 01:26:10,731
Then you have to take down your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side.

689
01:26:12,171 --> 01:26:19,051
This is the center of pure knowledge of Divine laws and also the knowledge how to work it out -

690
01:26:19,431 --> 01:26:22,411
it's very important.

691
01:26:25,091 --> 01:26:29,911
Then again you have to put your hand in the upper portion of our abdomen on the left hand side.

692
01:26:33,291 --> 01:26:37,851
Please all of you have to do it, please all of you do it.

693
01:26:39,371 --> 01:26:44,371
Now put your right hand on your heart, again.

694
01:26:49,391 --> 01:26:55,711
Now when you feel guilty the center here

695
01:26:56,711 --> 01:27:02,991
on, in the corner of your neck and your shoulder, here catches very badly

696
01:27:04,091 --> 01:27:12,091
and gives you diseases like Angina, Spondylitis - on the whole it makes your organs very lethargic

697
01:27:13,271 --> 01:27:20,671
so it's no use being guilty. Now turn your head to your right and press it hard here, as much as you can,

698
01:27:24,991 --> 01:27:29,531
knowing that you're not guilty in the eyes of God.

699
01:27:32,211 --> 01:27:37,411
Now, put your right hand on top of your forehead across

700
01:27:38,351 --> 01:27:46,091
and you can press it on both the sides - one side with the thumb, another side with your fingers

701
01:27:46,431 --> 01:27:52,231
and put down your head as far as possible. This is a center to forgive,

702
01:27:52,531 --> 01:27:55,711
to forgive everyone in general.

703
01:27:58,811 --> 01:28:06,031
We'll do that later on just now I'm showing you where to put your hand. Now please, take your right hand on the back side of your head

704
01:28:08,031 --> 01:28:11,011
and push back your head as far as possible.

705
01:28:15,831 --> 01:28:21,391
This is the center, where without feeling guilty - push back your head as far as possible.

706
01:28:22,231 --> 01:28:29,311
This is the center where, without feeling guilty, without condemning yourself, without counting your mistakes,

707
01:28:29,911 --> 01:28:37,211
for your own satisfaction, you have to ask forgiveness from this All-Pervading Divine power of love.

708
01:28:38,391 --> 01:28:44,271
Now, stretch your hand fully. Now the last center - very important.

709
01:28:44,891 --> 01:28:52,871
Put the center of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area which was a soft bone in your childhood.

710
01:28:54,271 --> 01:29:01,931
Put the center properly. Now, push back your fingers - this is for the actualization of the baptism, as they say.

711
01:29:02,751 --> 01:29:10,671
Push back your fingers so that there's a good pressure on your scalp. Now please put down your head, as far as possible

712
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:17,991
and now move your scalp, slowly, clockwise, seven times.

713
01:29:21,991 --> 01:29:27,911
Please move your scalp slowly, clockwise, seven times. Put down your head.

714
01:29:28,451 --> 01:29:36,451
This is the last center called as Sahastrara, means the lotus of thousand petals, which covers the limbic area.

715
01:29:50,951 --> 01:29:54,811
Now, that's all we have to do, that's all.

716
01:29:56,851 --> 01:30:03,851
You'll have to close your eyes, when I tell you, you can take out your spectacles - later on you can put them on.

717
01:30:05,831 --> 01:30:13,891
You have to put both your feet apart from each other, as I told you there are two powers separate - one complementary to other.

718
01:30:14,851 --> 01:30:18,751
Just put both the feet apart from each other. Put the left hand towards Me

719
01:30:22,911 --> 01:30:26,191
and now put the right hand on your heart.

720
01:30:27,491 --> 01:30:34,231
Please close your eyes. Put close them slowly, not pressing them down but just

721
01:30:37,331 --> 01:30:43,771
close them so that the lids are not pressed and compressed.

722
01:30:44,751 --> 01:30:47,711
Now here

723
01:30:55,811 --> 01:31:02,951
you have to ask Me a very fundamental question about yourself, three times in your heart.

724
01:31:05,331 --> 01:31:12,511
Please ask a question within your heart - you can call Me Mother or Shri Mataji whatever you feel like.

725
01:31:14,531 --> 01:31:21,751
"Mother, am I the Spirit?" ask this question in your heart. "Mother, am I the Spirit?"

726
01:31:35,571 --> 01:31:43,451
In the heart resides the Spirit and if you are the Spirit, you become your own master, your own guide, your own guru.

727
01:31:44,091 --> 01:31:51,811
So now, please take down your right hand into the upper portion of your abdomen

728
01:31:52,311 --> 01:31:55,671
on the left-hand side and press it, not very hard.

729
01:31:57,291 --> 01:32:01,791
This is the center for the principle of mastery.

730
01:32:02,411 --> 01:32:07,191
So now, you ask another, very fundamental question in your heart, three times

731
01:32:08,711 --> 01:32:15,271
"Mother, am I my own master? Mother, am I my own master?"

732
01:32:15,811 --> 01:32:19,491
Ask this question three times in your heart.

733
01:32:43,811 --> 01:32:47,611
I've already told you that I respect your freedom

734
01:32:49,071 --> 01:32:53,851
and I cannot force pure knowledge on you - you have to ask for it.

735
01:32:54,851 --> 01:32:59,731
So now, please take your right hand in the lower portion of your abdomen on the left-hand side

736
01:33:00,171 --> 01:33:05,411
and here you have to ask six times because this center has got six petals,

737
01:33:07,531 --> 01:33:10,631
"Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

738
01:33:13,811 --> 01:33:18,631
Ask six times, "Mother, please give me pure knowledge."

739
01:33:25,611 --> 01:33:33,651
As soon as you ask for pure knowledge, your Kundalini starts rising

740
01:33:36,711 --> 01:33:39,851
and when She starts rising,

741
01:33:43,831 --> 01:33:47,991
we have to understand that we have to nourish all the centers

742
01:33:49,771 --> 01:33:55,711
which are upper centers so that it's easy for Her

743
01:33:57,271 --> 01:34:03,351
to pass through. This has to be done with our self-confidence in ourselves,

744
01:34:04,691 --> 01:34:11,651
with our self-esteem and knowing what glorious things we are.

745
01:34:12,891 --> 01:34:17,351
Now raise your right hand in the upper portion of your abdomen and press it hard.

746
01:34:18,991 --> 01:34:22,011
Here

747
01:34:27,211 --> 01:34:34,571
you have to say, ten times, with full confidence, "Mother, I am my master."

748
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:43,551
Say in your heart, "Mother I am my master, " ten times.

749
01:34:47,331 --> 01:34:50,331
Press it hard

750
01:34:56,051 --> 01:35:02,651
Now the fundamental truth about you is that, you're not this body, not this mind,

751
01:35:03,431 --> 01:35:09,311
not this intellect, nor these conditionings and not your ego -

752
01:35:09,971 --> 01:35:12,991
you are pure Spirit.

753
01:35:15,091 --> 01:35:18,171
So now, raise your right hand on your heart

754
01:35:22,911 --> 01:35:28,451
Here you have to

755
01:35:29,271 --> 01:35:32,431
say again with full confidence,

756
01:35:33,371 --> 01:35:40,811
"Mother, I am the Spirit, I am the pure Spirit, " say it twelve times.

757
01:35:41,431 --> 01:35:45,151
"Mother, I am the pure Spirit."

758
01:35:47,711 --> 01:35:52,351
This self-confidence will open your hearts, will open your chakras.

759
01:36:00,291 --> 01:36:08,291
You have to know that this All-Pervading power is the ocean of knowledge, is the ocean of compassion and love,

760
01:36:08,991 --> 01:36:14,771
is the ocean of bliss but above all it is the ocean of forgiveness

761
01:36:15,431 --> 01:36:21,331
so whatever you may do wrong, whatever you think was against

762
01:36:22,751 --> 01:36:27,731
goodness, please forgive just now, forgive yourself,

763
01:36:29,191 --> 01:36:33,791
completely forgive yourself because all

764
01:36:34,591 --> 01:36:40,951
these mistakes can be easily dissolved by the power of ocean of forgiveness.

765
01:36:42,631 --> 01:36:46,151
So now raise your right hand in the corner of your neck

766
01:36:49,591 --> 01:36:56,951
and, neck and the shoulder and turn your head to your right fully.

767
01:36:58,951 --> 01:37:04,851
Here, very much with your self-confidence, you have to say sixteen times

768
01:37:06,131 --> 01:37:11,951
because this center has got sixteen petals, sixteen times with full confidence,

769
01:37:12,291 --> 01:37:19,871
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all, Mother, I'm not guilty at all."  Whatever people might have told you, forget it.

770
01:37:20,651 --> 01:37:25,111
"Mother, I'm not guilty at all, " please say it sixteen times.

771
01:37:30,911 --> 01:37:35,951
I've already told you, whether you forgive or don't forgive,

772
01:37:36,791 --> 01:37:41,031
you don't do anything. On the contrary you play into wrong hands.

773
01:37:42,251 --> 01:37:47,431
Those who have tortured you, are not troubled, while you are troubled.

774
01:37:53,651 --> 01:38:00,491
So you have to forgive all of them. Now raise your hand on your forehead across,

775
01:38:01,211 --> 01:38:04,251
press it hard on both the sides.

776
01:38:05,711 --> 01:38:09,131
Please put down your head, please put down your head.

777
01:38:09,291 --> 01:38:14,771
Here you have to say from your heart, not how many times, from your heart you have to say,

778
01:38:15,951 --> 01:38:20,311
"Mother, I forgive everyone, in general."

779
01:38:22,671 --> 01:38:26,691
"Mother, I forgive everyone, in general."

780
01:38:38,111 --> 01:38:45,591
Please say it from your heart. This center is a very constricted small center on the cross of

781
01:38:46,811 --> 01:38:52,251
optic chiasma - it has to open out only by your forgiveness.

782
01:38:54,651 --> 01:39:00,851
Now, put your right hand on the back side of your head

783
01:39:02,351 --> 01:39:09,031
on the optic lobe, as they call it, and push back your head as far back as possible towards the sky.

784
01:39:12,011 --> 01:39:19,971
Here, you have to say for your own satisfaction, not counting your mistakes,

785
01:39:26,671 --> 01:39:34,631
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything wrong knowingly or unknowingly, please forgive me."

786
01:39:43,711 --> 01:39:47,691
"Oh Divine power, if I have done anything

787
01:39:48,591 --> 01:39:51,591
wrong against you, please forgive me."

788
01:39:51,891 --> 01:39:59,311
And you have to say this again with your heart, not how many times but from your heart you have to say.

789
01:40:09,951 --> 01:40:15,391
Now, stretch your hand,

790
01:40:16,391 --> 01:40:19,471
stretch your palm fully

791
01:40:24,391 --> 01:40:27,411
and put the center

792
01:40:28,171 --> 01:40:35,111
of your palm on top of the fontanel bone area, which is a soft bone in your childhood.

793
01:40:36,491 --> 01:40:42,811
Now, put down your head, as far as possible,  put down your head, as far as possible,

794
01:40:43,231 --> 01:40:49,591
and most important is to push back your fingers so there's a good pressure on your scalp.

795
01:40:51,271 --> 01:40:58,271
Again here, I cannot cross your freedom, I respect it. I cannot force

796
01:40:58,611 --> 01:41:05,371
Self-realization on you. Please push back your fingers, please push back. Now you have to move your hand seven times,

797
01:41:06,191 --> 01:41:13,791
clockwise, slowly or we should say you have to move your scalp, is better. At that time you have to say seven times,

798
01:41:14,291 --> 01:41:21,311
"Mother, please give me Self-realization," seven times, "Mother, please give me Self-realization,"

799
01:41:21,551 --> 01:41:25,231
and it will work out. Please put down your head, please.

800
01:41:29,031 --> 01:41:33,531
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

801

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

804
01:41:48,611 --> 01:41:51,651
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE]

805
01:41:53,171 --> 01:42:01,171
[SHRI MATAJI BLOWS INTO THE MICROPHONE] Now please take down your hands, slowly open your eyes.

806
01:42:02,551 --> 01:42:10,391
You can put on your glasses. Now, put both the hands towards Me, like this. Watch Me without thinking.

807
01:42:11,591 --> 01:42:19,011
You just watch Me without thinking - you can do it. This is thoughtless awareness, Nirvichar Samadhi.

808
01:42:22,671 --> 01:42:29,871
Now, put the right hand towards Me, like this. Put right hand on - please bend your head

809
01:42:30,551 --> 01:42:38,591
and put your left hand on, not touching it, on top of your head, on the fontanel bone area

810
01:42:39,031 --> 01:42:42,811
and move it and see if there is a cool breeze

811
01:42:43,631 --> 01:42:51,091
or a warm breeze coming out of your head. Some people will get hot breeze - they have bad liver or if they have not forgiven. Even now you can forgive.

812
01:42:51,491 --> 01:42:58,451
See for yourself - bend your head. See for yourself if there's a cool or a hot breeze coming out of your head.

813
01:43:06,151 --> 01:43:14,031
Now put the left hand towards Me - bend your head, without bending you won't know. Left hand towards Me. Now bend your head as, and see for yourself

814
01:43:14,511 --> 01:43:20,791
if there is a cool or a hot breeze. Sometimes it is very close, sometimes it's very far away like a jet.

815
01:43:21,331 --> 01:43:27,831
See now for yourself, there's a cool or a warm or a hot air coming out of your own head. You have to certify

816
01:43:28,131 --> 01:43:31,111
[UNCLEAR - BEND NOW?], if it is there, just see it.

817
01:43:35,011 --> 01:43:41,171
Now please put your right hand again, once again. Bend your head and see for yourself

818
01:43:49,491 --> 01:43:56,811
with the left hand. Now, not to touch your head, little away, little away.

819
01:44:04,051 --> 01:44:10,191
Now raise both the hands towards the sky, like this. Here, straight, push back your head

820
01:44:10,511 --> 01:44:13,491
and ask a question three times,

821
01:44:15,071 --> 01:44:20,311
"Mother, is this the All- Pervading power of God's love?"

822
01:44:21,391 --> 01:44:27,491
or you can ask another question three times, "Mother, is this the cool breeze of the Holy Ghost?"

823
01:44:28,051 --> 01:44:34,491
or another question three times, "Mother, is this the Param Chaitanya, Mother, is this the Brahma Chaitanya?"

824
01:44:35,051 --> 01:44:39,311
Ask any one of these questions, three times, in your heart.

825
01:44:44,251 --> 01:44:48,791
Push back your head towards the sky.

826
01:44:51,891 --> 01:44:54,951
Now bring it down.

827
01:44:56,831 --> 01:45:01,311
First you'll feel very relaxed. Now put your hands like this.

828
01:45:03,631 --> 01:45:09,391
Those who have felt cool or warm or a hot breeze on their fingers or on their hands

829
01:45:09,871 --> 01:45:14,751
or out of their fontanel bone area, please raise both your hands.

830
01:45:19,951 --> 01:45:25,671
So beautiful! I bow to you all, your saintliness. May God bless you!

831
01:45:26,191 --> 01:45:31,471
Please continue with it. All of you have got it in Canberra - it's remarkable!

832
01:45:32,111 --> 01:45:38,971
May God bless you! But all of you should come. It's not that so many get realization and four five people come in.

833
01:45:39,291 --> 01:45:46,311
It's a very slow progress. You are so deep and you must know your depth. Please remember

834
01:45:46,591 --> 01:45:49,571
that all of you have to come.

835
01:45:52,191 --> 01:45:58,431
It's little late but I don't mind meeting you, if you have time - you can come, I would like to meet you all. [UNCLEAR]
